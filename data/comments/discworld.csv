Alternatively The Wee Free Men or The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents are both truly excellent. Don't be put off by the 'for children' thing, Terry didn't patronise kids.   Try to avoid reading books that take place in the middle or late in any particular arc, you'll miss a lot of really good development. I think there's a link in the sidebar to help you navigate the continuity.   I have mixed feelings about Nation. It's a very good book but it's maybe not as focused as the rest of them. Definitely still worth reading though! I quite liked The Dark Side of the Sun if you're interested in his non discworld stuff, it's delightfully weird."

Shortly after the impromptu performance by Tears of the Mushroom, Sam, Sybil, and Young Sam are in their carriage, driving back to the estate in silence. After some pregnant silences and deep thoughts, Sybil tells her husband to hunt the perpetrators  down.   Finally, after years of trying to change her husband, after years of trying to get him to relax, after forcing her husband to take a break and have a vacation, she tells her husband to be the man she fell in love with, to be the man he has always been, and do his job.

There is the germ of a good book in there - taking Vimes out of Ankh-Morpork and into a country house is a nice spin on the crime genre. But the slabs of dialogue and heavy handedness of it, especially when compared to the older Discworld novels, made this a difficult read for me.  What do you all think of this? Am I being unfair?"

It feels more like reading a rough draft of a Discworld novel than the finished book. There's still some spark of the greatness of his earlier works, but it's frayed, tattered, and incomplete.  I actually enjoyed UU, but it was actually the first Discworld book I read in full. Now that I've read most of the series, I know it's not his best, but it still was enough to pique my interest."

Snuff and Raising Steam have always held an upsetting, shameful place in my heart because I haven't been able to share this sense of difference with anyone else I know who's a fan of Pratchett's work. They loved the books because it's just more content, but I had difficulty reading it the entire way through.  I'm not a writer, or an English literature major, so I don't know what it's called; but the cadence was wrong.

I grew up on the wheel of time, and while I'm grateful to Brandon Sanderson for taking on the project and finishing it, the characters that he continues are basically different people when he's writing, and to me, sadly much of it felt forced and off balance. Reading the final epilogue, I could immediately tell that it was RJ's writing. It just had this rightness to it, this familiar ebb and flow that was immediately comforting.   Anyway, I just wanted to remark that the phenomenon that you experience with some of Pratchett's later works seems to me to be real, and indeed shared across authors."

I thought Snuff was a good capstone on Vimes' career in the same way I thought Maleficent was for Jolie's. It was hardly their best work, but it gave them a platform to let loose and be a star, something they've earned after working hard their entire career.

discworld,3dlye7,bld2527,3,Mon Jul 20 14:55:34 2015 UTC,"So, playing counter argument here (I do agree that this was no where near the pinnacle of Night's Watch, but liked it much better on my recent re-read.)  Sam and the Summoning Dark is an inner reflection of Sam's outer struggle between Vimes and Sir Vimes.  In this story, more then almost any other Sam seems at home as a member of the landed gentry.  He has finally accepted that as part of him. It gives him great power but he has to be wary, lest it consume him and turn him into the aristocratic wastes that he hates.  The Dark also gives him power, but he must restrain it lest he become cold, vengeful, uncaring - not unlike his lordly peers."
discworld,3dlye7,Brendan42,5,Sat Jul 18 00:47:13 2015 UTC,"The problem I found was that it was all too black and white. The villains for a start were rather bland. Young rust and company were largely unseen throughout the novel and felt only loosely connected and Vimes' ersatz Carcer nemesis was about as fleshed out as death of fleas (what happened to that death anyway?).  The goblins were all too consistent as if you could take one and replace them with little lost. Sure there was Stinky but everyone else was flat as paper. One thing Pratchett does try is to make races varied. The Feegle are a good example as in Carpe Jugulum they are shown to be shrewd negotiators strong in legalese whereas in Wee Free Men are absolutely horrified and ignorant of legal dealings and literacy. None of the goblins where shown to be exceptionally different taking into account both Snuff and raising steam, none of them are ever guilty of an actual crime (bar livestock theft) or have any friction in 'westernizing' (for lack of a better term).  But it is Vimes relation with the Summoning Dark that is most perplexing. At the end of Thud he has pretty much denied that the summoning dark had anything to do with him let alone gave him powers, now it is dropped with little or no development that he now has powers. Problem is magic is never an easy mistress on the disc, Wizzards have heavy limits on what and how much they can cast having to sit down after chucking an unaided (by props) fireball and witches use it sparingly unless they go cackling (or are a twit like Annagrama). This relationship is too easy, there is no sense of balance to it bar a vague hint that the Summoning Dark might be trying subvert Vimes's Guarding Dark.   Overall it all to easy, there is no speed bumps on the road to victory let alone a sharp turn resulting in simple gratification.    ~ Also it has been a bit so I'm not quite sure if I remember correctly, but what happened to the point about the Diamond king wanting troll drug smugglers to be tried (and most likely executed) by him and his? Can't quite remember if this one was resolved."

In my own writing, it is much easier to be crisp and concise when I can go back and readily edit my prose on the computer screen.  The Embuggerance meant Pterry had to stop typing and start dictating.  I've never been clear about exactly when, but I have certainly inferred that this severely impaired his ability to edit his own writing.  I was also disappointed with Pterry employing the Magical Negro trope with Tears of a Mushroom (Warning:  link to TV Tropes).  That's trite."

After that, your options are   Mort (First book following Death) Equal Rites (Technically the first Witches book, follows a character that isn't revisited again until much much later, third in publication order) Wyrd Sisters (the first Witches book that counts in my opinion) Guards! Guards! (The first City Watch book) Pyramids (standalone title, but it helps to have some more of the other books under your belt before picking it up) Small Gods (Standalone) Going Postal (required reading for City Watch books after Feet of Clay, first book in the Industrial Revolution set) The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents (marked as ""for younger readers"" but is still excellent. Standalone) The Wee Free Men (First Tiffany Aching book, recommended to read at least one Witches book before reading any Aching books, again marked as ""for young readers"" but is actually very good for all ages)   After The Colour of Magic and The Light Fantastic, you will have already met Death once or twice, so Mort is a good choice if Death seems like he'd be interesting to follow. If you want to experience more wizardry, but also see what other Magic is like on the Disc, Equal Rites is a good next step as well, as it follows both a Wizard and the Witches of Lancre (though it isn't called Lancre until Wyrd Sisters)  The Colour of Magic and The Light Fantastic are often regarded as the worst Discworld books. Pratchett was building the world and didn't quite know what he wanted it to be aside from a Disc on the back of four elephants who in turn stand upon the meteorite picked shell of the great Star Turtle A'Tuin. He gets closer to the final Disc with Equal Rites, but really hits his stride with Mort."
discworld,3dfap4,Jammintk,13,Wed Jul 15 21:08:44 2015 UTC,"Mort is fantastic. I started with it, and think it was the right decision.  Mind you, starting Discworld anywhere is the right decision. Just start, you probably won't be disappointed."
discworld,3dfap4,raisin_reason,2,Thu Jul 16 01:43:53 2015 UTC,The first two are the worst?! I thought they were colourful and fantastic!

discworld,3dfap4,FixBayonetsLads,17,Sat Jul 18 01:55:34 2015 UTC,"All pedantry aside, every Discworld book is a good read. I didn't even realize there was an ""order"" for them to be read in until I'd been through ten of them or so. (This was before the internet.)  I'd find another Discworld novel in the bookstore, pick it up, and read it. Sometimes similar characters appeared, sometimes similar places, and sometimes the only similarity was Terry's amazing writing.  Every book stands on its own. Read them in an order, if you wish, but you don't have to. Serendipity has its place in the world... walk into a used bookstore and see what Discworld they have available. (Usually it's only 2 or 3 titles.) Grab one, read it, add it to your collection.  You won't read any of the books only once, so you can go back later and read them in an order, if you so choose.  This will be downvoted to hell, but it's my opinion, and my experience."
discworld,3dfap4,happycj,6,Wed Jul 15 22:03:24 2015 UTC,"Honestly, this. I know this sub loves it's reading orders, but in very few books does it actually matter. I always just read the jacket descriptions and found one that sounded cool.   Btw... Hey guys, the last of my discworld collection has been shipped! I'm so excited!"
discworld,3dfap4,Aucassin,2,Thu Jul 16 03:29:49 2015 UTC,"Honestly, reading them in publication order gives you a really interesting view of the world as it develops and changes.  Reading them out of order means you miss out on a lot of the feel of the Discworld as a developing world.  The Discworld itself has so much character, and it's a shame to miss out on seeing it grow and change."
discworld,3dfap4,Drakkanrider,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:11:02 2015 UTC,"Something easily done with a re-read, I would say. The way I fell into the Discworld books was the same way for me. I borrowed a copy of The Color of Magic, and next thing I knew I was in a bookstore, reading the synopses. Picked one I liked and never looked back."
discworld,3dfap4,Aucassin,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:27:46 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I think the only two that feel like they need to be read in order (or at least some of them should be) are The Colour of Magic/Light Fantastic, and the Witches books from Wyrd sisters onward."
discworld,3dfap4,thegimboid,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:56:26 2015 UTC,"I did exactly the same, I read them completely out of order just based on whichever ones I found secondhand. But looking back on it, if I'd known I would've started from the beginning and read them all the way through. Having said that it doesn't matter too much either way, the books are brilliant no matter what order you read them in."
discworld,3dfap4,HarlequinValentine,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:47:45 2015 UTC,"Now you can have the fun of tracking a single character or story line through the books! Go back and think about who you want to read about - Vimes, Rincewind, Vetinari, whoever - and then put the books with that character in them in order. Read through them.  It's just as much fun as the first time you read the book!"
discworld,3dfap4,happycj,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:46:27 2015 UTC,"If you like the Color of Magic, then publication order is fine. I'm of the opinion that the series didn't really hit its groove until Guards Guards! but that's just me. And he's right, you won't read any of them just once... you'll find yourself picking them up again and again.   And for the record, I've never found a Discworld novel in a used bookstore."
discworld,3dfap4,Bar_Sinister,38,Thu Jul 16 14:53:58 2015 UTC,"If you have startet with Colour of magic and like it so far, you might just as well read them in publication order. anyway if you want to concentrate on a storyline later on Here: http://i.imgur.com/kvqoC1h.jpg is the order of the books sorted by characters"

discworld,3dfap4,HarlequinValentine,11,Thu Jul 16 08:50:02 2015 UTC,My favorite is the Watch series. Vimes evolves so much as a character over the course of the novels. I would definitely recommend them.
discworld,3dfap4,Zinthorr,5,Wed Jul 15 21:47:14 2015 UTC,"I'm also a Discworld beginner, only finished one so far. My first one was The Fifth Elephant, which was absolutely lovely. I also worried about it being the best to start with and what I should read next. To a certain degree I still sometimes think about these things, but my first left me with a strong feeling that it doesn't really matter.   The Fifth Elephant is far into the Discworld series and isn't even the first in the Watch series, but I never felt like I missed a joke or a bit of the story, it was just fine on it's own. Reading Mort now, which probably is the best loved novel in the series and so far it's very charming indeed.   If you asked me, I don't think you should worry so much. I'll just read what ever intrigues me at the moment."
discworld,3dfap4,Aylesbury,6,Wed Jul 15 22:34:07 2015 UTC,"I never felt like I missed a joke or a bit of the story, it was just fine on it's own.   This is one of the reasons I really feel that Pterry was a master storyteller. As you read the earlier novels there will be tons of ""Ohhhhh, you clever bastard"" moments."
discworld,3dfap4,BlackeeGreen,6,Thu Jul 16 00:20:33 2015 UTC,"While there aren't many references on the surface to be missed, Terry was a really clever writer. Something that doesn't seem like a reference at first is probably a reference."
discworld,3dfap4,Jammintk,3,Thu Jul 16 02:00:08 2015 UTC,"The style 'calms down' a bit after the first couple books. Still funny, but a bit less manic and more thoughtful. I'd stay int he low numbers for a while, but can give no other advice."
discworld,3dfap4,macbalance,4,Wed Jul 15 21:53:06 2015 UTC,I enjoyed publication order.
discworld,3dfap4,linsell,3,Wed Jul 15 23:22:33 2015 UTC,If you like Colour of Magic then I would recommend just going in publication order. People recommend later ones first because colour of magic turns some people off. If you find one you really really like then you can skip ahead to the later books in that storyline.
discworld,3dfap4,Babirusa1,3,Wed Jul 15 21:28:58 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest: while I have a clear and definite favorite (all right, two, Sam Vimes and Moist Lipwig), I think that publication order is your best bet. Sir Pterry built his world as he went, and unless you go with him on his journey, you miss out on seeing him introduce an idea in one novel, only to have fun with it as a main theme of the next. Also -  and I mean this sincerely - there is no bad Discworld novel. I have my favorites, but literally every single one of them is enjoyable. Go to it!"
discworld,3dfap4,acaleyn,3,Thu Jul 16 03:56:03 2015 UTC,"When he died, I decided to do a full series reread (probably my 10th) and did it in publication order. It is amazing how many little tie ins there are. Especially in the one off books (Monstrous Regiment, Unseen Academical). That said, if I want a person to become HOOKED on discworld, I usually offer up the Guards series. And it has yet to fail. Mr. (to those who earn is) Vimes is an amazing story."

discworld,3dfap4,DEFINITELY_A_DICK,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:46:39 2015 UTC,Read them in published order. His writing style improves and gets more grounded and sure as the series goes on.  Also if you don't do that then you'll miss all the little callouts to the earlier novels that he puts in them
discworld,3dfap4,abritinthebay,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:11:17 2015 UTC,"If you already like The Colour of Magic that's fine, but I would have been put off if that and/or The Light Fantastic had been my first Pratchett reads. I feel he really finds his feet and the style which most of the rest of the series shares with book 3 - Equal Rites.  That said, if you want one 'stereotypical' Pratchett book to get a feel for the series as a whole I'd recommend Guards! Guards! It's the first book in the Guards series and still my favourite Discworld book. I actually started off with Moving Pictures, and loved it, but I was disappointed when the next book didn't feature any of the same characters because Moving Pictures was a standalone rather than part of a series. I got over that though, there were plenty of new awesome characters instead ;)"

The only difference is they use less old sayings and the main character is younger.  Some people ignore them, but they're arguably some of the best books."

It's a Law of Narrative that if your gang consists of two people (a gangette) one will be the brains of the outfit and one will supply the muscle and speak like dat.

What it comes down to is that the kind of people subscribed to /r/asoiaf are there to read in-depth theories and character analysis. The kind of people subscribed to /r/breakingbad, /r/gameofthrones, /r/rickandmorty, and /r/discworld (examples) are there because they really like a series and are happy to be in a group where they get all the inside jokes and can remind each other of all the best bits. Unlike /r/asoiaf, they're catch-all subs for all fans, both hardcore and casual. There'll always be more of the latter than the former in a fan group so the macros and images float to the top.

I looked at a few other sites a while ago but I just don't think the series has a big enough online presence for that kind of community to develop. It's a pity, but at least there is some discussion here. It's quite like /r/KingkillerChronicle, in that the top posts are announcements and memes, but there are heaps of text posts and theories if you drill down."
discworld,3d9259,HarlequinValentine,3,Tue Jul 14 23:39:26 2015 UTC,"Sorry to jump in but I actually really like the selection of content here. Sometimes I like more in-depth discussion and sometimes I just want to see a cool t-shirt, or help someone who's getting in to the series. I feel there's a good balance. I was in some Discworld groups on other social media that were almost entirely memes and pictures of bacon (not to mention a lot of arguments). I ended up unsubscribing even though there were some lovely folk in there. I much prefer this sub!"
discworld,3d9259,InfantStomper,2,Wed Jul 15 08:25:28 2015 UTC,"I do too! I fear I may have come across the wrong way but /r/Discworld is one of my favorite subs on this site, mostly because everyone is just so nice here! That's why I've been trying to get the OP to stay by saying that the top posts of any fan-type sub are rarely representative of the day-to-day content, just like how you shouldn't judge a book by its cover or a film by its trailer.    However, from OP's reply I gathered that he/she was looking for an /r/asoiaf style subreddit for Discworld (All posts are either book news speculation or analysis and discussion), which unfortunately (for him/her) does not exist. /r/Discworld is a glorious melting pot of all Discworld posts, whereas A Song of Ice and Fire has two major and highly active subreddits in /r/gameofthrones and /r/asoiaf. That allows people to pick what kind of content they want to see, something that we Discworld enthusiasts can't do.    I'm perfectly happy in /r/discworld and it's a lovely companion as I slowly make my way through this awesome series, but back when I stated the series about a year and a half ago this place seemed almost dead! There were only about 2 posts per week and they got less relevant as time went on. That's why I went looking for other sites online, because for a series as popular as Discworld there must be an active community somewhere.    Thankfully, this sub seems to have had something of a resurgence recently and there's loads of people posting now so we're all getting a great mix of discussion and references. Long may it last! :)"
discworld,3d2khj,Rastus452,5,Mon Jul 13 00:40:18 2015 UTC,"You're kind of lucky. Wyrd Sisters is pretty much Pratchett saying ""Y'know, I liked Granny Wheatherwax, but since Esk is at the University now, I need a new main character!"" And so Magrat Garlick was born. I feel like Wyrd Sisters and Equal Rites are both great books to start with as far as the Witches are concerned.  As for the reading order, its more of a guideline and less of a hard and fast rule. The only specific reading order rules I would suggest are these.   When reading the City Watch books, Read Going Postal (Moist von Lipwig/Industrial Revolution) after Feet of Clay, but before the rest of the Watch series. Read the Death/Susan books in order Read the Rincewind books in order Read the Tiffany Aching books in order Do not skip the books labeled ""for younger readers."" They are some of Pratchett's best work. Overall, Publication order is best, as long as you don't mind the rough first three books, because Pratchett builds the world as the series continues and its cool to see it grow. If something seems like it might be a reference, it probably is. Read the footnotes!"
discworld,3d2khj,Jammintk,3,Mon Jul 13 01:58:48 2015 UTC,Good lord. Do people not read footnotes?
discworld,3d2khj,jgphoenix,3,Mon Jul 13 03:57:49 2015 UTC,Some of the books (in eBook format) aren't laid out well for them (the footnotes aren't linked) or the touch targets are hard to hit on some eBook reader apps.

discworld,3d2khj,jgphoenix,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:33:30 2015 UTC,"IMO, the footnotes are all on their own page, so if you don't remember which footnote you read, or accidentally skip one, you wind up confused for a bit on the footnotes."

The footnotes in Reaper Man are almost un-useable on my Ebook, whereas others like Going Postal pop up wonderfully in their on little window.  Or you have some where half pop up in a window and the other half take you to a list at the back of the book.  Since I just bought the whole series on my Kobo this is currently a big pet peeve of mine.  My goal is to figure out how to go into the books in Calibre and fix the coding."

discworld,3d2khj,jgphoenix,3,Tue Jul 14 22:23:23 2015 UTC,"I'm probably not the one to ask about reading order since I read all the later ones first in haphazard order as they came to my library without having read any of the starter novels. So I say just go for it, whichever one(s) sound most interesting. The chart has been helpful to me in figuring out where everything goes. As far as the witches storyline, I read Tiffany Aching first, then the ones after Equal Rites, then went back to the ""first"" one. Equal Rites does not have too much to do with the other witches ones, so you won't be missing much, but I did find Equal Rites helpful for understanding things in the Rincewind/wizards books. My favorite story/plot has to be Moist von Lipwig. Going Postal is the first Discworld book I read, and it's still my favorite."
discworld,3d2khj,nonesuch42,3,Mon Jul 13 01:12:20 2015 UTC,"The four main series (Death, Guards, Rincewind, Witches) feature the same central characters and tend to discuss similar themes.  For example, a common theme of the Witches books is that magic is not the solution; people are the problem, and people are the solution, they just may need some prodding.  So if you like what you're reading, continue on in that series (Equal Rites and Witches Abroad are both fine choices).  If you feel like exploring something new, start another series."

discworld,3cewh7,infernal_llamas,19,Tue Jul 7 11:12:13 2015 UTC,"Texas lawyer, here.  I often create LLCs and similar companies for clients.  Ethically, my first hurdle is finding out who my client is.  If I am representing one owner in negotiating terms of ownership, then I cannot represent any of the others.  But if all the owners have agreed on terms, then I can represent the company I am forming and act as a neutral ""scrivener"" for the deal.  When I do this, I have all the owners execute a conflict waiver, agreeing that data from one cannot be kept confidential from any of the others, and I cannot represent any of them in negotiating terms.  In this role, I can advise the entire group and ask questions of the entire group regarding terms they may have overlooked -- sometimes in a meeting, but usually via email, so there's a record they each had a chance to address this.  However, I cannot get involved in their negotiation of the overlooked terms or the agreed answers to my questions.  In short, yes it is entirely feasible for an experienced lawyer to create an agreement between co-owners that will be ""fair"" -- by embodying the basic terms that sophisticated co-owners would typically negotiate."

discworld,3ce845,CarTastic,20,Tue Jul 7 05:45:30 2015 UTC,I've always felt that publication order is the best way to experience Discworld for the first time. The whole series fits on a single timeline; there's lots of world building and retconning and cameos that make more sense in publication order.
discworld,3ce845,The_Tuxedo,10,Tue Jul 7 07:31:22 2015 UTC,"As someone who started at Guards! Guards! I agree with you. After I'd finished Feet of Clay, I went back to the beginning and started the whole series again. There are so many forward and back references across all the books, it's staggering.  I'm seriously impressed with the amount of minor detail that Sir Terry was able to keep about all of his characters and the entire world. I guess that when you create a world and the characters in it you end up filling in all the blanks, even a few that never make it into the books."
discworld,3ce845,GaProgMan,5,Tue Jul 7 07:54:29 2015 UTC,I started with the first three 16 long years ago and then read them randomly.

I think Sourcery is the last hurrah of the old-style Unseen University, with it being rebuilt during Eric to become the modern Ridcully-led version in Interesting Times which was ultimately for the better.  It's just that the books transition from blatant parody to something deeper along the way, which could be jarring if read in a weird order.

He is crafty, knows how to read people and to manipulate the masses for the greater good. He understands the city and how it works. Also, it really makes sense to me that Vetinari would see that Carrot waiting on the wings would do more to keep the ruler of the city straight (well, as straight as Moist would get) than if he were in charge himself.   Carrot would end up Commander of the Watch, and will settle down with Angua. It's kind of annoying that their relationship wasn't explored a bit more. In the Art of Discworld Sir Terry hints that he has a few ideas about where they would go together, but it seems that other things held his attention and he didn't end up getting them on paper. I assume that just means that the status quo is maintained."
discworld,3c5v12,Three_Headed_Monkey,24,Sun Jul 5 02:54:34 2015 UTC,"agreed. i would add to this and say that there are a couple reasons why Carrot can't become patrician. one is his birthmark and sword, and the possibility that he could be of the old lineage of Ankh-Morpork's kings, which he wouldn't be able to do because of his loyalty to ""Ol' Stoneface"" Vimes, which also gives him a second reason that someone needs to keep the patrician in check."

It would have been an excellent clash there, as Vimes fights Vetinari and Vetinari plays him like a fiddle. And an interesting clash, as Carrot would have been behind Vimes on this one, but Vetinari always showed the way forward to achieve a city that works, not one of ideals.   Though Vetinari really did not think much of the idea of democracy, so it's difficult to see how he could install a monarchy without an elected government beneath."

discworld,3c46lk,Babbit_B,12,Sat Jul 4 17:31:13 2015 UTC,"Obviously loads of parallels to the real world as others have noted, but I always took it originally as parodic take on Lankhmar, the city from Fritz Leiber's Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser series. Note the evocative similarity of the names and the description from Wikipedia, which sounds a lot like the early Ankh-Morpork. In part,   Lankhmar is richly described as a populous, labyrinthine city rife with corruption; it is decadent and squalid in roughly equal parts and said to be so shrouded by smog that the stars are rarely sighted (the city's alternate name is ""The City of Seventy Score Thousand Smokes""). Located next to the Inner Sea, Lankhmar is visited by ships from across Nehwon and is the starting point for Fafhrd and the Mouser's many sea voyages.   I think you'll find loads of other parallels. The Colour of Magic also opens and ends with Rincewind et al. encountering Bravd the Hublander and Weasel, obvious Farhrd and Gray Mouser stand-ins. They observe the burning city from a hill and reminisce about places they knew as they go up in flames. The reference has always seemed obvious to me, although as with everything else in Discworld it rapidly transcended literary parody and became real world satire.  As to the real world, Wikipedia says,   Leiber's Lankhmar bears considerable similarity to 16th Century Seville as depicted in Cervantes' classical picaresque tale ""Rinconete y Cortadillo"": a bustling, cosmopolitan maritime city, into whose port galleons sail laden with gold from which only a few benefit, with a thoroughly corrupt civil government and a powerful and well-organized Thieves' Guild—all seen through the eyes of two young adventurers who formed a partnership to guard each other's back in this dangerous milieu. However, Cervantes' protagonists, less daring than Leiber's, do not confront the Thieves' Guild but instead enter its ranks."

discworld,3c01cm,Axenyy,5,Fri Jul 3 15:20:07 2015 UTC,"‘Granny Aching . . . that is, my grandmother said someone has to speak up for them as has no voices,’ Tiffany volunteered after a moment.  ‘Was she a witch?’  ‘I’m not sure,’ said Tiffany. ‘I think so, but she didn’t know she was. She mostly lived by herself in an old shepherding hut up on the downs.’  ‘She wasn’t a cackler, was she?’ said Miss Level, and when she saw Tiffany’s expression she said hurriedly, ‘Sorry, sorry. But it can happen, when you’re a witch who doesn’t know it. You’re like a ship with no rudder. But obviously she wasn’t like that, I can tell’  ‘She lived on the hills and talked to them and she knew more about sheep than anybody!’ said Tiffany hotly.  ‘I’m sure she did, I’m sure she did—’  ‘She never cackled!’  ‘Good, good,’ said Miss Level soothingly. ‘Was she clever at medicine?’  Tiffany hesitated. ‘Um . . . only with sheep,’ she said, calming down. ‘But she was very good. Especially if it involved turpentine. Mostly if it involved turpentine, actually. But always she . . . was . . . just . . . there. Even when she wasn’t actually there . . .’  ‘Yes,’ said Miss Level.  ‘You know what I mean?’ said Tiffany.  ‘Oh, yes,’ said Miss Level. ‘Your Granny Aching lived down on the uplands—’  ‘No, up on the downland,’ Tiffany corrected her.  ‘Sorry, up on the downland, with the sheep, but people would look up sometimes, look up at the hills, knowing she was there somewhere, and say to themselves “What would Granny Aching do?” or “What would Granny Aching say if she found out?” or “Is this the sort of thing Granny Aching would be angry about?” ’ said Miss Level. ‘Yes?’  Tiffany narrowed her eyes. It was true. She remembered when Granny Aching had hit a pedlar who’d overloaded his donkey and was beating it. Granny usually used only words, and not many of them. The man had been so frightened by her sudden rage that he’d stood there and taken it.  It had frightened Tiffany, too. Granny, who seldom said anything without thinking about it for ten minutes beforehand, had struck the wretched man twice across the face in a brief blur of movement. And then news had got around, all along the Chalk. For a while, at least, people were a little more gentle with their animals . . . For months after that moment with the pedlar, carters and drovers and farmers all across the downs would hesitate before raising a whip or a stick, and think: Suppose Granny Aching is watching?  But—  ‘How did you know that?’ she said.  ‘Oh, I guessed. She sounds like a witch to me, whatever she thought she was. A good one, too.’  Tiffany inflated with inherited pride.  ‘Did she help people?’ Miss Level added.  The pride deflated a bit. The instant answer ‘yes’ jumped onto her tongue, and yet. . . Granny Aching hardly ever came down off the hills, except for Hogswatch and the early lambing. You seldom saw her in the village unless the peddler who sold Jolly Sailor tobacco was late on his rounds, in which case she’d be down in a hurry and a flurry of greasy black skirts to cadge a pipeful off one of the old men.  But there wasn’t a person on the Chalk, from the Baron down, who didn’t owe something to Granny. And what they owed to her, she made them pay to others. She always knew who was short of a favour or two.  ‘She made them help one another,’ she said. ‘She made them help themselves.’  In the silence that followed, Tiffany heard the birds singing by the road. You got a lot of birds here, but she missed the high scream of the buzzards.  Miss Level sighed. ‘Not many of us are that good,’ she said. ‘If I was that good, we wouldn’t be going to visit old Mr Weavall again.’  -- The Wee Free Men, from ch. 4 ""The P L N"""

discworld,3bz7rd,Fulcro,2,Fri Jul 3 14:43:16 2015 UTC,"I'm like you in that respect. I like Making Money and didn't notice/thought about a change in writing style. I only think it could have been more blunt in its message (like the witches' books often are).  I have thought for a long time that money only exists in our heads. It's not a force of nature like the sun or the ocean or the tectonic plates that we have little to no control over. We have the man-power, the resources and the know-how to solve many problems and the resources and man-power to feed, clothe and house that man-power. And what's hindering us? Something that doesn't really exists.  Or to put it like the message I got from Making Money: Money gets its value from consent. It only has value because everybody agrees (or is forced to agree) it has. And the Glooper hints at the fact that it is only useful to society while it is moving around, not accumulating in one place. If more people were aware of this, maybe we could get some control over the tool back and not have the few who have control over the money control us.  As for Unseen Academicals, I too had problems getting into it. I don't like sports of any kind and it did feel different. But I re-read it some time later and liked it better the second time."
discworld,3bz7rd,illgetmecoat,2,Sun Jul 5 10:59:45 2015 UTC,"This is definitely a sad one this week because there's a strong sense of what might have been with this (and Unseen Academicals, which I couldn't finish). Pratchett's health problems at this point heavily affected his writing abilities, which is awful for someone so playfully intelligent.  There's the hint of a great book in Making Money, but it reads like a rough first draft to me.  Above all though, what is amazing is how he was able to improve his writing for the subsequent books. I'm not a huge fan of Snuff or Raising Steam, but I Shall Wear Midnight is fantastic. The fact he could write these is unbelievably impressive.  Thanks, as ever, for reading these. Sorry it's such a depressing post."
discworld,3bz7rd,HarlequinValentine,2,Fri Jul 3 10:07:32 2015 UTC,"I feel very similarly in that I thought Making Money was the first where it started to feel off, and Unseen Academicals was worse (though I stuck with the book and it does have some brilliant moments, so I'm glad I did, even though I'm not sure I'd re-read it). I Shall Wear Midnight was a relief in that it worked a lot better and was (at the time) a lovely ending to Tiffany's story. And then I didn't get on with Snuff or Raising Steam either - again they were like flashes of brilliance but a lot of monologuing and things that didn't seem to go anywhere.  Having said all that, I also have enormous respect for Sir Terry that he carried on at all, and the books he produced while suffering from PCA were still better than the majority of people could even dream of!   I do wonder what it is about ISWM that made it stand out, because I'm not sure if I could explain why I preferred it to the other later ones.

discworld,3bz7rd,ToxethOGrady,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:21:37 2015 UTC,"Making Money was a disappointment, and I did finish Unseen Academicals but knew I wouldn't read it again when I slotted it into the bookcase.   I hadn't read Pratchett with any expectations -- that there was a reason things happened, that the story was something that was planned, drafted, edited, rewritten, and polished. I read them instead like a narrative of live events, and wouldn't particularly notice if something didn't make sense or failed to fit into a theme or message. It was just another thing, and things kept happening, and it was OK because it was a joy to read.   But Making Money was like a few earlier books I didn't particularly like. It was also one of the only ones that forced me to re-read a few paragraphs four times in a row to try to make sense of what happened (the golems at the broken bridge) - not in terms of it being a mystery, but in terms of just not knowing what was going on but the story assuming I did.  Getting another Discworld book as time went after that didn't have the same excitement as it did before. ISWM was a break in that pattern, but it was also bleak with too few moments of feegle hilarity. I think the one broom flight scene may have been the only event that prompted laughter for the last handful of books."

Cackling is not just, A 'Nasty' laughter. It means your mind, Drifting away from its anchor. It means, loneliness and hard work. Driving you crazy, a little bit at a time. Until you thought it was normal to stop washing, And wear a kettle on your head. It means thinking, Right and Wrong, are Negotiable. In the end... It means going to the Dark, A BAD road!

It also captures the standalone books (Pyramids, Small Gods etc) that might otherwise get missed along the way. It's also a bit of a nostalgia trip for me:  this is the order I originally read them in because I was reading them as they first came out.

What seemed more sad to me was when I realized that there will never be a Raising Taxes book, a continuation for Mr Nutt in the dark country, or a story for when Vimes finally retires and Carrot will have to take on more power because it seems like there were so many more hints of what was going to happen."

He described how the earth orbits around the sun and how the sun, in turn, orbits around the center of a vast collection of stars called our galaxy. At the end of the lecture, a little old lady at the back of the room got up and said: ""What you have told us is rubbish. The world is really a flat plate supported on the back of a giant tortoise."" The scientist gave a superior smile before replying, ""What is the tortoise standing on?"" ""You're very clever, young man, very clever,"" said the old lady. ""But it's turtles all the way down!""

But Marc's artbook Coverama is well worth getting if you're a fan. It has all his art for Discworld as well as for A Song of Ice and Fire, and other projects."
discworld,3bbdur,HarlequinValentine,1 point,Sun Jun 28 08:41:36 2015 UTC,"Ok, no books with these covers then - I tried looking at amazon.com and the covers are horrible (probably US versions), where (online) can I get either the black covers or the weird drawings (Kidby or Kirby, can't remember) as unused copies? My local bookstores don't have Discworld."
discworld,3bbdur,HarlequinValentine,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:32:55 2015 UTC,Probably your best bet is The Book Depository. They do free worldwide shipping and usually have every edition. For example:  http://bookdepository.com/search?searchTerm=the+colour+of+magic

Other people suggest going for the best books, or picking characters they like and reading those books in order.  I myself liked reading them in the order they came out. I feel the world became more rich as I continued the books. I liked exploring the discworld as Sir Terry Pratchett explored them."

discworld,3ba0tk,jgf1123,3,Sat Jun 27 06:12:06 2015 UTC,"Second this.  The Colour of Magic and The Light Fantastic go together.  After that, I would advocate exploring some of the other series (Death, Watch, Witches)."

discworld,3ba0tk,TheGodBen,4,Sat Jun 27 08:34:38 2015 UTC,"Another vote for publication order! The only reason I tell people to start with other books is because I know a bunch of people who didn't like The Colour of Magic and refused to read any more. Even Sir Terry himself told people not to start with it (I think it says that in the sub sidebar, or used to). But if you already made it through TCOM then you're fine!"

It's funny, and it's clever, but it lacks meat. Some people are put off by that. Personally, I think that the book is okay, but it pales in comparison to later books in the series."
discworld,3ba0tk,I_burned_my_arm,3,Sat Jun 27 17:04:18 2015 UTC,You can go either way.   chronological order in which they are written.

A very endearing sight, I’m sure you will agree, and even as I watched, the mother otter dived into the water and came up with a plump salmon, which she subdued and dragged on to a half-submerged log. As she ate it, while of course it was still alive, the body split and I remember to this day the sweet pinkness of its roes as they spilled out, much to the delight of the baby otters who scrambled over themselves to feed on the delicacy. One of nature’s wonders, gentlemen: mother and children dining upon mother and children. And that’s when I first learned about evil. It is built in to the very nature of the universe. Every world spins in pain. If there is any kind of supreme being, I told myself, it is up to all of us to become his moral superior. --Lord Vetinari, Unseen Academicals"
discworld,3b6ed6,Elly1010,6,Fri Jun 26 12:39:42 2015 UTC,"There's a scene in Night Watch (linked, because it's way to long to copy and paste) where Vimes thinks over the vast resources the city consumes every day, and what it gives back to the world in exchange, and how important it is that the little wheels keep turning so the big one don't jam up."

discworld,3b6ed6,Coolmikefromcanada,3,Fri Jun 26 22:02:25 2015 UTC,"Tiffany's homecoming scene is a lovely, touching and sad scene and really underlines aside from the humour and satire, how wonderful Pratchett could be as a writer. You should give it a reread. The Tiffany books are brilliant. I cannot wait for the Shepherds Crown.  What's your favourite piece of his writing?"
discworld,3b6ed6,Tiffany_Aching,7,Fri Jun 26 10:04:12 2015 UTC,"My favourite piece or writing is either the mind battle with the hiver, or the piece you choose, or the end of I shall wear midnight, where tiffany flies above the chalk.   Or ""sin is when you start treating people as things"""
discworld,3b6ed6,Three_Headed_Monkey,6,Fri Jun 26 12:27:09 2015 UTC,"The ""all sin begins when you treat people as things"" quotes is one of my favourite. When you think about it, it is so right. In some way, all immoral acts start when you don't think that someone else is on the same level as you. Where they may not think about how their actions will effect another human being."
discworld,3b6ed6,HarlequinValentine,2,Fri Jun 26 13:08:43 2015 UTC,The ending of A Hat Full of Sky is mine. I don't think it's actually possible for me to read it without welling up. The sections about Granny Aching in The Wee Free Men are really beautiful as well. I'd forgotten the part of Wintersmith you mentioned but I imagine that'll get me on my reread!
discworld,3b6ed6,petrichorified,3,Fri Jun 26 20:05:00 2015 UTC,"The path to wisdom does, in fact, begin with a single step. Where people go wrong is in ignoring all the thousands of other steps that come after it. They make the single step of deciding to become one with the universe, and for some reason forget to take the logical next step of living for seventy years on a mountain and a daily bowl of rice and yak-butter tea that would give it any kind of meaning. While evidence says that the road to Hell is paved with good intentions, they’re probably all on first steps.    Hogfather.  And just a few gems I love from Good Omens,   The text will be slowed down to allow the sleight of hand to be followed.   God moves in extremely mysterious, not to say, circuitous ways. God does not play dice with the universe; He plays an ineffable game of His own devising, which might be compared, from the perspective of any of the other players1, to being involved in an obscure and complex version of poker in a pitch-dark room, with blank cards, for infinite stakes, with a Dealer who won’t tell you the rules, and who smiles all the time.   ‘Thanks for the warning,’ Scarlett purred. Her voice sounded like something that lurks in the long grass, visible only by the twitching of its ears, until something young and tender wobbles by.   ‘You do know you could find yourself charged with being a dominant species while under the influence of impulse-driven consumerism, don’t you?      I went into my Kindle's saved highlights to find the first quote and couldn't help sharing those others, though I don't know which would be Sir Terry and which would be Mr Gaiman. If I had to guess I'd say 1, 2, and 4, were definitely Sir Terry's."
discworld,3b6ed6,dantemp,2,Fri Jun 26 11:18:47 2015 UTC,"Who decided that Tiffany's books are ""YA""? Did he said so? Does the young protagonist define it? How does it work? For me it is just another Discworld book and the style isn't much different than any other. It's not like that was the first books where kids were the main character."
discworld,3b6ed6,HarlequinValentine,6,Fri Jun 26 10:27:50 2015 UTC,"He did, I think. Amazing Maurice was the first dedicated YA novel and won the Carnegie Medal on the UK. These books are also published by Random House Children's Books in the UK.  I know what you mean though. I started reading Discworld when I was 12, which is ""prime"" YA territory. I'd be happy handing anyone of that age any of the books."
discworld,3b6ed6,Tiffany_Aching,2,Fri Jun 26 10:43:56 2015 UTC,"It's mainly a marketing thing - but I imagine it was Sir Terry's decision to write a children's book. And what they choose to market it under is often down to content and age. I would say that the first 2 books are children's/Middle Grade, while Wintersmith is pitched a little older (Tiffany's age plus the odd mention of sex/romance) and I Shall Wear Midnight is definitely YA (again due to protagonist age, romance and some very dark events). Shepherd's Crown will presumably be YA but might add even more adult themes."
discworld,3b6ed6,thesuperevilclown,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:02:30 2015 UTC,"It's YA because of the lack of ""the pink pussycat club"" and other things that make the other books adult"

First off, it says ""...and Paul Kidby (English painter and illustrator) who, among other things, created the Discworld series"" and i had no idea that Paul Kidby created Discworld. Secondly, the only Otto i know of in Discworld is a photographer vampire that i just can't associate with this puppet. In fact, i can't associate this marionnette with any Discworld character. I just don't get it."
discworld,3b72fy,emeraldreactor,3,Sat Jun 27 01:00:30 2015 UTC,Yeah.... I completely agree. Someone hasn't done their research
discworld,3b72fy,theodorusrex,4,Sat Jun 27 02:00:07 2015 UTC,"I was thinking that maybe it was a marionette that just happened to already be made and then they were like ""hey, maybe if we name it after this Discworld thing that's apparently popular, maybe someone will buy it even tho it's totally creepy"" (i have an irrational fear of marionnettes), but Otto's an obscure enough character that i have to assume that these people have read the books. Maybe the Czech translation is actually so bad that this is how it describes Otto?"
discworld,3b72fy,emeraldreactor,3,Sat Jun 27 03:40:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, isn't Otto described as having the (possibly) only photographer's vest with tails? I'm pretty sure he is also described as wearing an opera cloak with a bunch of pockets sewn into the inside at some point."

discworld,3b6f2j,L_Cranston_Shadow,8,Fri Jun 26 10:12:39 2015 UTC,"I would just have to expect the unexpected. I can't imagine a succinct transition in Pratchett's books. There would be a swirl of many story-lines around the change of the Patrician, from the Watch to UU, Von Lipvig to Lu-Tze. Deep down, part of me believes that, if only as an all too brief cameo, the thud pieces on the board of Ankh-Morpork would be moved by the simian hand of the Librarian."

discworld,3b6f2j,BlackeeGreen,3,Wed Jul 1 09:06:16 2015 UTC,"I thought of that too when I read it when it was published, and I came to the same conclusions as you, I couldn't decide between Moist and Vimes.  Moist is younger, so probably him (if we take as true the possibility) but Vimes could be a very strange patrician and fun too.  I remember when I read it, the first one I read in english, not knowing it would be the last, imagining ""what if Terry dies one day ? What would happen ? Would the discworld make kind of a jump few years in the future,, where the patrician would be no longer alive, and we could see how the world evolved and all that.  Great, now i'm sad :("

discworld,3b6f2j,Erdnal,3,Fri Jun 26 20:53:31 2015 UTC,"I'd thought about this too, and came to a similar conclusion.  Vimes, Moist or some combination of Vimes and Moist.  Vimes has the moral center and is unshakable in his incorruptibility, but he's a bit stolid, and he's not very good at dealing with people he dislikes or is contemptuous of.  Moist, on the other hand, is very good with people, but his moral compass is new and possibly still fragile.    I think I eventually decided that Vimes has enough weight now, as Duke of Ankh-Morpork and Commander of the Watch, to keep a Patrician Moist in line and focused on the needs of citizens.   I think the two of them, in a duumvirate, would be hilarious, but that might just be me."
discworld,3b6f2j,lethalcheesecake,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:55:18 2015 UTC,"Vimes wouldn't be the patrician, he'd hate it.  Most of the guild leaders would be locked up for one reason or another, as well as any relative of Rust!  As for Moist, possibly.  He's too young and sees life as a giant toy box.  Maybe when he has settled down and older.  Adora would keep him in check though."

discworld,3b6f2j,CanvasWolfDoll,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:40:24 2015 UTC,"How about Young Sam? I mean, Vetinari's pretty old - based on Night Watch, I think we can safely assume he's the same age as Vimes and I'd personally guess based on cover art and description that Vimes is in his early fifties. So let's say Vetinari, who obviously has access to the highest level of medical care in probably all of Discworld (outside Klatch) lives to a generous 70 years old. That gives Young Sam maybe 15 years to grow up. By the time Vetinari walks with Death, he may indeed begin to play a part in the ruling of the city. After all, he is a duke's son. He'll probably be educated at the Assassin's Guild too. And I mean when it comes to age and capabilities obviously characters much younger than or the same age as Young Sam would be have done incredible things (Tiffany, Mort, Teppic, Brutha, etc).   To be completely honest, I don't think Pratchett would've gone this way, but I still think it's a viable option, and much more realistic than Vimes Sr. or Moist."
discworld,3b6f2j,HamadAlK,1 point,Wed Jul 1 11:19:53 2015 UTC,"It's possible, but the reason I thought Moist, besides the fact that Vimes would hate to be ruler (too much paperwork, not enough street walking), is that I always figured that Moist was at least 10+ years younger than Vimes.   I've always figured that Vetinari was in his 60's, Vimes was in his 50's, and Moist was in his 40's. You're right that Night Watch precludes Vetinari being much older than Vimes, but I have to guess that he's a little bit older."
discworld,3b6f2j,HamadAlK,1 point,Wed Jul 1 11:24:35 2015 UTC,"Really? I've always thought of Moist as younger, more in his 30's than 40's, but maybe I give way too much credit to the artwork.   Besides, it seems to me that Pratchett only believes in four age groups: ancient, middle aged, young adult and child.  (ancient: Cohen, Weatherwax, Ogg, all the wizards, etc.)"
discworld,3b6f2j,HamadAlK,1 point,Wed Jul 1 11:31:47 2015 UTC,"30's is a possibility is too, that would probably give more credence to the idea of Vetinari being in his 50's rather than his 60's... in fact that works better than my previous statement.    I'd argue that Vimes would be in his late 40's to early 50's then, making him the same age to maybe 5 years younger than Vetinari, which would also mesh more with Night Watch.   I don't have a quote on hand but I think Vimes' age has been commented on, possibly in The Truth, although without giving an exact number.  On that note, I always figured that William de Worde is roughly the same age as Moist. The books say that he acts/writes like an older man (tweed up his bum was alluded to once I believe); however, numerous hints are given to him being relatively young."
discworld,3b6f2j,Flower_Boogerface,1 point,Wed Jul 1 11:37:31 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Vimes and Vetinari are definitely within five years of each other, no matter their respective ages.  Another thing - I think Moist is way too valuable in his current role of leader of - every civic institution, I guess? - to be Patrician. There is such a thing as too busy, and I'd personally be disappointed if a Patrician Moist was written with the same sort of can-do attitude and man of action scenes that dominated his other careers. I mean, I just don't think that'd translate well to being leader of the state."

discworld,3aqzax,seoulless,2,Mon Jun 22 23:39:26 2015 UTC,You're right -- the fifth. I misremembered.
discworld,3aqzax,emkay99,2,Tue Jun 23 10:57:09 2015 UTC,Have you read The Long Utopia yet? The ending of that is... Perfect.
discworld,3aqzax,Danimeh,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:57:53 2015 UTC,Read the Long Earth and felt it was more Baxter than Pratchett - worth reading the series for the ending?
discworld,3aqzax,CaptnYossarian,3,Tue Jun 23 03:14:07 2015 UTC,"I've posted this elsewhere too but once I worked out what was going on I loved the series & I want to share the love:   Before you read The Long Earth series you should read Pratchett's short story, The High Meggas which you'll find in his short story collection A Blink Of The Screen. This is like the faetus of The Long Earth. Also read Strata and The Dark Side of the Sun, to get your head used to Terry Pratchett writing science fiction because scifi Terry is a little different to fantasy Terry.  If you have time I recommend maybe giving some Baxter a go. The Long Earth often gets dissed for not being Pratchetty enough (I dare say there's a Baxter forum somewhere on the internet where people are complaining about Pratchett's bits), but it was written by two brilliant very different authors, one of whom is writing a different style to what we're used to. If you approach it with this in mind you'll enjoy it much more.   Also, one of the thinks about The Long Earth is that that the world(s) itself feels like one of the characters. You're as interested in the Long Earth as you are the people on it. This is especially true of the later books. Most of characters do have Pratchettesque tinges too them (a Harley Davidson riding Keats quoting nun who the Pope refers to as 'a worthy opponent'; a Tibetan mechanic reincarnated as artificial intelligence; an atheist reverend who loves GK Chesterton) but the way the books are written doesn't allow for the full Pratchett experience. As I said before the world itself is so rich and fascinating that this is actually ok. And there is still just as much philosophy in the LE series as there is in Discworld, particularly in the later books. It would be a shame to create an infinite amount of Earths, set humanity loose on them and only get to see it through the eyes of a few people for a few years. Everything about the Long Earth series is huge, slow and epic, like a Diplodocus walking.   I found once I changed my mindset as I went in I really loved the books.   Tl;dr Yes."
discworld,3aqzax,Danimeh,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:48:46 2015 UTC,"Cheers - I had read Strata & The Dark Side, I enjoy Pratchett's other forays just as much, but something about The Long Earth didn't grab me enough to pick up the second book. Plus Lobsang the Tibetan Mechanic made me think too much of Thief of Time, so perhaps I was expecting Lu-Tze and the History Monks to show up at some point."
discworld,3aqzax,CaptnYossarian,2,Tue Jun 23 05:31:26 2015 UTC,We do NOT need inexpert copies or pastiches.   Which was my reaction to And Another Thing...
discworld,3aqzax,randomguy186,-2,Tue Jun 23 04:20:01 2015 UTC,"Though I suppose terrible fan fiction is inevitable.   I cried when I realized that ""Raising Steam"" was essentially in this category."
discworld,3aqzax,emkay99,3,Tue Jun 23 13:57:03 2015 UTC,"What? It's somewhat more didactic than usual, but Pratchett had been leaning in that direction in most of his recent work. And I didn't think it was a bad story at all. (Though the whole ""Moist Lipwig"" arc feels rather different than the other Discworld sub-series.)"
discworld,3aqzax,randomguy186,-1,Tue Jun 23 14:01:10 2015 UTC,"Read ""Thief of Time"" or ""Nightwatch"" and tell me that ""Raising Steam"" is of the same caliber. I'm glad I read it, but it's something that only a fan could enjoy - i.e. fan fiction.  Reading it drove home that Pratchett (the man) was still with us but Pratchett (the author) was gone."
discworld,3aqzax,emkay99,3,Tue Jun 23 14:04:05 2015 UTC,"No run of some 50 books by the same author are all going to be of the same quality. I consider Thief of Time to be in the lower third of Pratchett's work in terms of quality. Especially compared to something like Small Gods, which I regard as one of his very best.  There's really no point in arguing about personal taste in food or reading.  And I'll wait until I read the fifth Tiffany Aching before believing that ""Pratchett (the author) was gone."""
discworld,3aqzax,randomguy186,-6,Tue Jun 23 14:09:59 2015 UTC,"There's really no point in arguing about personal taste   Eh, I'd agree, but my analysis of ""Raising Steam"" isn't about taste. We'll agree to disagree, but I assert that if I took a month to do an objective analysis of word choice, sentence structure, paragraph ordering, narrative flow, etc. then I'd find that ""Raising Steam"" would have an objectively lower quality than Pratchett's other later works.  And I, too, am hoping (though pessimistically) to see something of the writer I loved in the fifth Tiffany book."

discworld,3aqzax,interactionbill,5,Tue Jun 23 09:44:28 2015 UTC,"That wasn't necessarily my point. Christopher lived in his Dad's shadow, never became his own author, and for the most part produced sub par stuff."
discworld,3aqzax,tankplanker,2,Tue Jun 23 09:50:23 2015 UTC,"He seemed quite content to work as an editor for his dad's work though, he would have gotten his own publishing contract for his own books on whatever he wanted to cover via his surname if he'd wanted to.   Without him we'd never have had The Silmarillion or the Unfinished tales, they aren't LotR good but they are still very important works that took difficult decisions on conflicting notes/source material."

discworld,3aq384,Grandy12,21,Mon Jun 22 16:17:01 2015 UTC,"Not with my books at the moment, but if my memory serves, the eighth son is a wizard. Wizards are celibate, because the eighth son OF an eighth son is a source of magic, a Sourcerer.   More directly to your question, Esk is a special case because the magical spirit in her staff ignored/broke the gender rules.  In later books there's no indication the Wizards all have eight brothers. For example, Rincewind has no family (his mother ran off before he was born), and Ridculy has only the one brother that we know of.   Perhaps anyone can study enough to be a wizard, but Eighth Sons have a natural advantage?"
discworld,3aq384,Merron,10,Mon Jun 22 17:38:45 2015 UTC,Or perhaps 8th sons will be wizards whether they want to be or not.

I don't think that normal Wizards have to be the 8th child (I don't think Rincewind has 8 siblings for example). Wizards, while they have a small natural talent, need to learn magic.  Sorcerers are born with a strong natural connection with magic which they can tap into to control and change their surroundings."

discworld,3aq384,booleanerror,2,Mon Jun 22 18:57:02 2015 UTC,"It never said that the eighth son had to be the eighth child. The eighth son could be the fifteenth child. And in a world with high infant mortality, having that number of children wouldn't be a hugely noteworthy occurrence."

That's in today's western society, but the books have a pseudo-medieval-industrial setting. More kids means more mouths to feed, but also more hands for work.  Historically, people have had a lot of kids. If every mother had only one child, then the population would get smaller every generation. The population explosion in the last century is from that, plus the drastic decrease in infant mortality.  Also a thing about your numbers, a family that has in order one son, seventeen daughters, and then seven more sons, has an ""eigth son"". Factor that into your math :)"

Therefore you are the 3rd generation of males. Repeat for 5 more generations.  Or do you mean that for 8 generations every son has exclusivly male children?"

There's usually tile based graphics (so usually quite basic) and movement (so you jump from point to point, rather than run along freely). They usually have a high level of randomisation, so one action this time might not result in the same result next time. E.g., in this game, I meet a guy called Captain Morgan. I need him to give me his rum. This time, I might ask to buy some and he'll sell it. Next time, he might deny the existence of said rum and attack me if I question it.   But mostly, they're effing hard. I haven't beaten Convoy yet, and I've beaten the boss but never made it back on Faster than Light. They're fun to play despite this because of the randomisation and the chance that anything can happen."

While the game was being flown to Austria for duplication (PC-CD) I crashed it several times (I was doing on site QA at TWG.) Rather than stop duplication (it's expensive and delays the game release) we created an 'Installation Disk' floppy that was included in the box.   Nobody at the time questioned why a CD game needed an installation floppy, or why that floppy should only be used AFTER the CD game installed... PC-CD being new, and floppy being the old it just seemed to be 'OK' with the mentality of consumers... So we got away with it ;)  We would now class it as a 'Day 1 patch' and it's pretty standard. But the fact Discworld was the innovator of this practice, and 20 years ago too! That makes me feel warm inside :D."

discworld,3adz69,pratchettjob,19,Fri Jun 19 10:02:02 2015 UTC,"What is a bit odd is how Vimes shuts down the city in order to get home one night to read to his son...   It's actually Carrot who does this. Vimes even comments that he wouldn't have had the nerve.   edited to add:  Which suggests that the ""abuse of power hypocrisy"" criticism might be unwarranted. I personally disagree with some of your other criticisms as well, but that's probably more down to a difference of opinion. I'm enjoying this series though, and am looking forward to the next entry."
discworld,3adz69,tegularius00,19,Fri Jun 19 14:27:55 2015 UTC,"I think this is a very good point.  Carrot is the one that abuses the power, and Vimes lets him.  Carrot does it because it is important to Vimes.  Vimes lets him because part of him wants it, and part of it is Carrots knack for being the perfect king.    If carrot was doing things like this for himself, that would be bad.   But it's for the city's most loyal servant, so does that change things?  If Vetinari had decreed that nothing in the city would stop Sir Vimes from reading to young Sam as a reward for saving the city/disc yet again, I doubt much of an eye would be batted.    Vetinari and Carrot both are interesting views of dictator power used, not for personal gain, but to make the city better.  In many ways they do far better then a democratic government could do.  Is it so wrong then for the rightful king to grant a boon?  It also reminds me of Sam willingly accepting free donuts and the like to coppers as part of the grease that keeps the wheels rolling.  He would never ask the watch to go so far to get him home, but when the do it on their own he can't feel anything but grateful.    All in all, I think it is a flaw, but one of the ones that keep you human."
discworld,3adz69,Tebwolf359,12,Fri Jun 19 15:35:22 2015 UTC,I don't think Carrot abused his power.   Carrot probably asked everyone nicely.
discworld,3adz69,vezokpiraka,12,Fri Jun 19 15:43:04 2015 UTC,"By name, no doubt.   It's easy to see how it would go."
discworld,3adz69,HumidNebula,8,Fri Jun 19 16:30:11 2015 UTC,"I think that's right. Vimes rails against those who abuse power out of selfishness or ego, like the Lord Rusts of the world. Those who use their power for the good of the city, like Vetinari and Carrot, he respects. Even in Nightwatch you can see the respect he gives to the officer who visits the barricade in Treacle Mine Road - Vimes approves of him because he demonstrates that he knows that following orders is not the same as doing the right thing."
discworld,3adz69,tegularius00,2,Fri Jun 19 15:47:11 2015 UTC,"Just to chip in, these are good and interesting points - it's great to read counter-arguments to mine.  My problem with it is that Vimes is someone who HATES the pomp and ceremony of power, let alone its abuses. But he's seemingly fine with it and it felt out of character. There was no bollocking, no Carrot mucking out the latrines as a punishment, just he got home and read young Sam his story.  It just didn't sit right with me, particularly how Vimes gets even worse in Snuff. He's superhuman and pompous as hell at that point. There's none of the playfulness of Pratchett with him. It's just ""Vimes is awesome""."
discworld,3adz69,batty3108,8,Fri Jun 19 15:45:39 2015 UTC,"This isn't anything to do with pomp or ceremony, though. And I think you're overstating the size of what Carrot did. He closed two roads, he didn't shut down the city.  Yes, it would have caused immense chaos, but Vimes notes that this wouldn't have figured in Carrot's logic. There was a problem, he solved it. This resulted in a new problem, but he would fix that too. A bit of gridlock at rush hour is hardly a new thing for Ankh-Morpork."
discworld,3adz69,tegularius00,6,Fri Jun 19 17:04:52 2015 UTC,"I agree that Vimes hates the pomp and ceremony of power, but he also knows the uses of power. He talks about it as a kind of collective dream - there are barely 100 coppers in Anhk Morpork (approximately), but they have to convince a population of over 1 million people that they have some kind of authority. He goes on to say, when he's been a duke for a while, that even though he hates all the crap that goes with it, ""in a way, he could see the point... he represented a lot more than himself these days"". It's what allows him to go to Uberwald, or to Borogravia, and act as a copper to the world.   In fact, you can go beyond Vimes to someone like Granny Weatherwax, with whom he has much in common. With both characters there's a general sense of ""when other people do it, it's wrong, but when I do it it's ok"", the justification being that they both loathe and distrust themselves to ensure that they don't allow themselves to abuse the power that they can wield. And then there's the reason Carrot gives for why he doesn't want to be king... anyway, I'm rambling. I guess the point is that he doesn't order Carrot to shut down the main street during rush hour, and generally when Carrot does something impossible involving large groups of people Vimes has consistently been baffled and amazed rather than angry, so I don't see it as out of character here either.  Snuff is a different kettle of oysters, I think, and as much as it's impossible to say precisely what Pratchett's writing would have been like without the Embuggerence, I tend to give a more sympathetic eye to the writing in his books post-Thud."
discworld,3adz69,BuddhistJihad,9,Fri Jun 19 16:44:59 2015 UTC,"I do agree to an extent that it is forgettable in the detail - only the scene with Vimes alone underground going mad sticks in my head - but I often remember Thud! with fondness because it had that dark, almost oppressive feel to it that you mentioned. That atmosphere sticks in my memory. I've also mined it for inspiration in terms of tone for D&D quests."
discworld,3adz69,ScreamThyLastScream,3,Fri Jun 19 15:02:25 2015 UTC,Ha! The D&D thing never twigged with me. I like that a lot - the image of a society undermining the city is one of my favourites from Pratchett.

discworld,3adz69,lazzerini,7,Fri Jun 19 23:57:40 2015 UTC,"Vimes went from the gutter and a life of petty crime to being a cop. We dont know why. But Keel taught him to be an honest cop.  I found it strange that Vimes would become an honest cop. Not honest as in a cop who would stay bribed but a cop who would not be corrupted.  Then he became a drunk. Why? Again we dont know but consider his background.   From the poverty of the gutter to a life of petty crime and having money, at least, a bit of money which is more than he and his family had before.  Then he became a cop and a corrupt cop can get rich but not Vimes. Keel taught him to well and perhaps he remembered his Mothers honest struggle. So there is a dichotomy. Then he realised what an honest cop cannot do in a corrupt city which is the job.   So he was, in his own mind, not just useless but also corrupt in that he took money for not doing his job.  So, drink it away.  So, change from criminal to cop. From cop to honest cop. From honest cop to drunk and corrupt cop. All changes.  And then came the dragon and Vimes got power from what happened then and could be an honest cop again and gave up the drink.   Vimes is smart. He builds an honest organisation...ie a modern police force but he, himself, knows that it is held together by himself and allowed by Vetinary only as long as it is held together by Vimes. Carrot could do it but neither Carrot or Vetinary want this.  So Vimes is at the top of the heap, has money, influence and POWER and cannot use them as he is constrained by his own sense of morality. Thud did not change him. Thud is Vimes being Vimes. The street fighter he was as a young kid shucks off the veneer of civilised policing and policeman and he goes for the throat. Dont fuck with the Vines when he doesnt have to account for his actions  What changed Vimes was Snuff cause then he melded the dont fuck with me streetfighter and the honest cop into a a person who used and abused the authority of his position both as a cop and a lord of the manor and acted as a thug to solve a problem which should have been solved in a legal manner.   And it could have been. His wife showed one way of solving it...ie social acceptance and this was reinforced by the Patrician. Legal solutions would have followed. The people responsible would probably have escaped punishment and this was what was unacceptable to Vimes.  Vimes lost it and was forever after changed."
discworld,3adz69,ChimoEngr,3,Fri Jun 19 14:09:52 2015 UTC,"Thud! is one of my favorites. I love Vimes, and I love the plot. It's one of the best mysteries. The clues all come together - [Spoilers] the crazy artist who thought the chickens were coming to get him, the Device that the dwarves were secretly excavating the city to find, the story of the tapestry, meeting the king of Trolls - Mr. Shine Him Diamond, and the board game Thud! And of course ""Where's My Cow"", and you can just picture Vimes doing the voices. It's just a great book. The climax is super fun as well, and I think that the parallel with the beginning forgives the whole silliness about the roads shutting down to get him home on time. Yes, it's privilege that Vimes usually wouldn't tolerate, but Carrot knows some things are Important.  Full disclosure, I also own and cherish a copy of Thud: The Board Game."

discworld,3adz69,TheAndies,2,Mon Jun 22 19:04:37 2015 UTC,"This is the way I see it, not an abuse of power but their way of showing how much everything he has done means to them."
discworld,3adz69,HarlequinValentine,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:15:05 2015 UTC,"Because I feel we move from Pratchett using him as a flawed and (ultimately) heroic guide to the Discworld, to someone who is beyond reproach.  Pratchett dropped Granny Weatherwax as a protagonist after Carpe Jugulum, where it seemed clear she had nowhere else to go. I feel he should have done the same with Vimes after Night Watch - it was a brilliant and fitting conclusion to his arc.  But here, he seems pompous, abuses his power and does so many things where you are meant to think 'wow, cool' but end up thinking 'really?'.  It's an odd book, ultimately. I loved the epic pub crawl between the Watch's women officers, and Nobby's romance, but the book was a bit clunkier than recent reads. It does have some great comic set-pieces.  What do you think of this? How does it compare to the other Watch novels? Thanks, as always, for reading the blog :)"
discworld,3adz69,Sgt_Colon,12,Fri Jun 19 10:05:34 2015 UTC,"I think there are two main arguments for Thud's existence and Vimes post Night Watch:   Vimes as a father. We've seen Vimes devoted to his job, and struggling to fit Sybil in with that part of his life, but now we see him finally realising that he has something in his life more important than his job: Young Sam. Seeing that he's more than a policeman, and him realising the same were great developments.  Vimes as an avatar for justice, not revenge, and not the law. The Summoning Dark wanted revenge, and Vimes had to go outside the law (by abusing his power) to ensure that justice was served.    In comparison, I don't think Snuff did as good a job. Yes, it had its moments, but it fell down too often. The Embuggerance was really starting to be noticeable here, with the hero having a tendency to be infallible (or if he does make a mistake, it's one that's noticed and corrected by the end of the paragraph), and characters not having dialogue, but rather long monologues where they insert the other character's lines and opinions as part of the speech. Thud had differing voices and opinions, and the characters progressed and learned at a more natural pace."

I'm betting there's a good chance this latest book will expound further on his ""ant-like human hive minds"" theme (Coalescent, Exultant). Don't expect witty satire. Baxter loves to world-build about events that occur over geologic time periods. This is in contrast to Pratchett, who would rather than talk about how sensible people should handle difficult situations (the Witches theme).  I love Baxter's books, but not for the same reasons that I love Pratchett's books. I felt like The Long Earth was 50% Pratchett and 50% Baxter, The Long War was 25% Pratchett and 75% Baxter, and The Long Mars felt like 10% Pratchett and 90% Baxter.

discworld,3aatrc,scottmill,3,Fri Jun 19 15:10:09 2015 UTC,I think Sheemie and Lobsang are very Pratchett like in their construction but as his role likely diminished in the writing process of those books they have less and less of a Pratchett-like voice.
discworld,3aatrc,CFC_Reed,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:25:23 2015 UTC,"I get the feeling that due to his illness, he created a lot of neat ideas like stepping and Lobsang and the zeppelin travel and the beagle-people and then handed the outline over to Baxter.  I may be doing a disservice to Baxter, but all of the characters (save Lobsang, who is outrageous) seem too ""life-sized"" when compared to the Discworld's larger-than-life cast."

Tiffany looked at his face. The noise from the tug-of-war was silenced. The birds stopped signing. In the grass, the grasshoppers stopped rubbing their legs together and looked up. The earth moved slightly and even the chalk giant (perhaps) strained to hear, and the silence flowed over the world until all there was was Preston, who was always there.

Even the Silver Horde, all of them, backed down when Carrot got stern with them.  Granny is certainly up there for the most intimidating, and the Luggage is definitely one of the more physically dangerous beings, but there aren't many that combine those traits as effectively as our boy Carrot Ironfoundersson."

discworld,39tx81,Tiffany_Aching,1 point,Sun Jun 21 01:37:48 2015 UTC,Actually what I really want to see is an animated film of Wee Free Men done by the folks behind the Book of Kells.
discworld,39tx81,RoseRedd,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:40:45 2015 UTC,yeah that does sound really cool - but maybe just for a younger audience? Idk if the Tiffany Aching books will attract an adult audience :/
discworld,39tx81,gggggrrrrrrrrr,17,Sun Jun 14 19:18:58 2015 UTC,I feel like the Tiffany books are actually really dark and have rather adult themes. It's silly to dismiss a book just because the protagonist is a bit younger.
discworld,39tx81,TheActualAWdeV,3,Sun Jun 14 20:52:38 2015 UTC,"I feel like the Tiffany books are actually really dark and have rather adult themes.   The cunning man, for example."

discworld,39tx81,macbalance,4,Sun Jun 14 21:33:17 2015 UTC,"The Tiffany Aching is a lot like a response to Harry Potter in many ways. This includes being something of a 'coming of age' story that (like the HP books) grows with the reader. More mature subjects and complexity. The TA books have a slightly higher base level, though."

It seems to get a lot of hate on here, but I think aside from the hog father it was the best made thus far, including the animated wyrd sisters and soul music, which were not that great.  There's also a color of magic/light fantastic movie, I think it's meh but I do love their rincewind and twoflower.  I'd love to see Nightwatch, but that would probably require at the very least that a guards! guards! film be made first for it to make sense."

Although as I understand it they often try to get the translators to inject some jokes that will work in the translated language.   If I remember right the French version of Mort (or one of the other Death books) contains a pun by the translator in a footnote that says something along the lines of ""La Mort est un mâle, car c'est un mal nécessaire"": ""Death is male (mâle) because it's a necessary evil (mal)"". Obviously it doesn't work in English, but it does in French, and it's such a Pratchett-esque pun as well."

I managed to snag a first/first US book club ""very good"" hardcopy for $80 but that was a steal. I've seen these advertised for sale at up to $10k but I can't see anyone getting that price unless it's mint and Terry signed it in blood. $200-$300 is more realistic.  Edit:I would recommend shelving that copy and reading an ebook version or paperback. Book are best stored on wooden shelves and in low humidity. Most homes with AC are fine.

discworld,39ojtc,HairyMidget,4,Sat Jun 13 06:47:53 2015 UTC,"I would suggest an early Vimes book; they are very easy to get into. I found Colour of Magic to be so early it had a distinctly different feel to the rest of the books.  I started with Guards, Guards when I was too young to get half the references but never had any problems chronologically. I think the order isn't so important, but starting with ""Early Pratchett"" is definitely a plus."
discworld,39ojtc,massivedragon,1 point,Sat Jun 13 13:53:58 2015 UTC,I'm currently in getting back into the series. I'm just onto 'Men At Arms' after finishing 'Guards! Guards!' this week. I read 'Colour of Magic' a few years back but didn't revisit the world until now.  So as a relatively new reader I have had no issues going down the Vimes route.
discworld,39ojtc,tipperarytrad,3,Sun Jun 14 13:17:54 2015 UTC,"Honestly there is no correct order. You can read them in published order or at random.

discworld,39ojtc,Abadatha,1 point,Sat Jun 13 11:02:34 2015 UTC,Mort IMO.    Or just grab a reading order timeline off t'internet and pick a storyline that you like the look of and start with the earliest one I that series.    Order of release works fine too :) Although the first 3 books are a bit slow.
discworld,39ojtc,jeffois,1 point,Sat Jun 13 12:37:39 2015 UTC,"Start with the first books in the City Watch, Death, or Witches books. The Color of Magic, The Light Fantastic and Equal Rites (less so) are the worst Disc world books and are significantly different from the rest of the series.  I would suggest Guards! Guards! as a first book. In many ways, a deep dive into Ankh-Morpork is more interesting than any other place on the Disc."
discworld,39ojtc,Jammintk,1 point,Sat Jun 13 15:32:42 2015 UTC,Start with the first one and end with the last one. You miss out on so much world building and retconning if you only follow a specific group of characters.

Pratchett gives you a fairly unrepentant conman, responsible for deaths and lives ruined, and makes you like him.  It's a brilliant book, funny, angry and strongly political. What do you all think of it? Am I correct in ranking him as highly as the sainted Blackboard Monitor?"
discworld,39keka,1080Pizza,39,Fri Jun 12 10:03:50 2015 UTC,Going Postal is actually one of my favourite books to recommend to new people who aren't fantasy readers. Along with The Truth. They're easy to get into and things like newspapers and postal offices are something recognizable. Pratchett gives them a cool twist. And then you can be like 'Oh that Vimes guy? He has his own series of books.'
discworld,39keka,blekkja,9,Fri Jun 12 11:22:54 2015 UTC,"Good point, though you have ruined the thing we had going on. :p  These would make good starters, though it might make the progression back to ""old"" discworld a bit jarring. This is why I like Men At Arms. It's a better novel than Guards, Guards and is the first to ask what would happen if these races were more than cliches and actually had to co-exist with each other, hence laying the foundation for the novels that followed it. I don't think it would have the same effect coming back to it. But I digress."

I do have one quibble but it's probably more of a worldview argument than anything wrong with the article -- you label Reacher Gilt as a capitalist a couple times. He's explicitly not a capitalist. Moist is or at least becomes the capitalist: he recognizes the value of the clacks, just as he also recognizes the experience and expertise of its engineers, another form of capital. Reach Gilt either doesn't recognize, doesn't care, or deliberately goes about destroying capital, looting whatever has material value and discarding what doesn't. He is a pirate."
discworld,39keka,Duodecimal,6,Fri Jun 12 12:06:47 2015 UTC,"Capitalist can also mean a person who is most interested in enriching himself. See hedge fund managers, bank execs, etc. They may not make a single thing, but they do take a cut off the top of any created capital they can. But, your label of pirate is also not incorrect."
discworld,39keka,ChimoEngr,3,Fri Jun 12 12:54:31 2015 UTC,"You're absolutely right about the typo - well spotted!  I think Reacher is very much the wrong kind of capitalist, but a capitalist nonetheless."

I'll put it another completely different way -- what kind of impression do you get of the kind of people who use the word ""liberal"" as a slur?   I'm not sure if that's much of a thing outside the US, but maybe it's a bizarre enough idea that you get a feel for the point I'm trying to make. Not just the type of people with the misspelled signs protesting against helping the impoverished, but otherwise sensible-seeming people who uncritically dismiss a belief by turning its label into a term of abuse or conflating it with criminality."

discworld,39keka,ToxethOGrady,3,Fri Jun 12 10:57:46 2015 UTC,That's debatable.
discworld,39keka,divinesleeper,20,Fri Jun 12 10:58:07 2015 UTC,"Most assuredly YES. And I'd include Tiffany Aching and the Patrician in that list.  Pratchett has a habit of making his recurring lead characters evolve over several novels into what we would consider demigods. Sam Vimes withstood an ancient entity and became his own mentor. Granny Weatherwax is the most notable example of this. She went head-to-head with the Queen of Elves and borrowed bees; she sent an entire kingdom to sleep, turned aside a steel blade with her bare hands, and Weatherwaxed vampires - she was seemingly unique in the history of Discworld in all these acts. Death slew Death, faced down the multiverse's Auditors, and rebirthed the avatar of rebirth. Tiffany grew from a big sister and shepherdess to an apprentice witch, an edge witch, and the embodiment of summer, all before she was 15.  The Patrician's growth over the course of the series is perhaps the most subtle, but he clearly progresses from a remarkably skilled assassin to a tyrant to a benevolent despot who could hold in his head the machinations of an entire city. Moist was on course, I feel, to becoming the next Patrician. We never got to see the full bloom of his powers, but it's clear to me that he would have reached the same epic levels as Pratchett's other characters."
discworld,39keka,blekkja,4,Fri Jun 12 21:27:07 2015 UTC,"That's an idea worth considering, Moist as the next patrician. I wonder if Pratchett had the same idea."

discworld,39keka,divinesleeper,15,Fri Jun 12 10:48:04 2015 UTC,"Making Money and Raising Steam, to name two. And there are hints in one of the books (I think it's at the end of GP) that he would have been the taxman as well. That would have been fun."
discworld,39keka,blekkja,24,Fri Jun 12 10:49:11 2015 UTC,"I think it's at the end of GP   Nope, end of Making Money, I recently reread it. I believe it's also very subtly implied that Vetinari is grooming him to become his successor.  On one hand I do indeed think it'd have made more sense for Moist to progress onto taxes, on the other hand the idea of Raising Steam (which I have yet to read) does sound more exciting.   But they're connected, right? Vetinari needed money for his ""great expansion"", and the train network was included into that expansion."
discworld,39keka,_PM-Me-Your-PMs_,14,Fri Jun 12 11:09:51 2015 UTC,"I believe it's also very subtly implied that Vetinari is grooming him to become his successor.   I got this too.   /u/pratchettjob puts it pretty well in his blog - I don't think I had solidly made the connection between the Patrician and Moist being fairly similar in so great a fashion. The differences could simply come down to Vetinari had the bloodlines and went to school, Moist didn't and learnt the hard way."
discworld,39keka,Nygmus,13,Fri Jun 12 11:39:18 2015 UTC,"Moist didn't and learnt the hard way.   Which is why he is being groomed as the new Patrician. If anything, a man of his mobility and talents very much represents the new Ankh-Morpork.  You have a chief of police who started in the gutters and the city's future leader who came from the gallows. That's much better than the lines of privilege and 'right' to power.  Witches are different, I suppose, but they are easily seen as the most powerful types in the Discworld. Because they are very much in touch with the common man and woman - Tiffany coming from the Chalk and all that.  (I'm now wondering if I need to write a full on Marxist analysis of the entire series. That may take some time...)"
discworld,39keka,TripJammer,3,Fri Jun 12 11:51:04 2015 UTC,"I wonder if maybe Vetinari saw Moist as being able to take over AM once he was done with it. He seemed to be using Moist to set up institutions that would endure, and realistically that's the way out of a more tyrannical rule, I would think. Or one way anyway. It has ways of limiting the scope of the Oblong Office, in the same way the Guilds did. Right now (or at the beginning of Discworld) AM had to be ruled by a tyrant, by a...perhaps evil is too strong, but could we say not good, person? It seems like Vetinari is doing his best to reform AM so that the next ruler, whether it's Moist or someone terrible, can only do so much to shift it.   I could almost see it as Vetinari performing the necessary evils so Moist could come in and be a better man, a shining example, a heroic figure for the city to rally behind, even though realistically all the good things would've been done by Vetinari himself.   Damn. I get why Rhianna (sp?) didn't want to write more but I wish we would get more Discworld. I know there's one more to come but still."

discworld,39keka,LaxBouncer,6,Fri Jun 12 16:29:59 2015 UTC,"Pratchett identified more with the libertarian ideology, didn't he? I think it's more of a point about meritocracy rather than stressing the ""ordinary roots"".  In fact, I think he voices his thoughts on ""equality for everyone"" rather clearly in Night Watch, when he mentions that Reg sees the people as how he thinks they should be, and not as people are, and how men like him will always end up being disappointed by ""The People"".  There's a pretty amusing dialogue about it on p. 343-344."

But I think it suffered from some of the same problems as Unseen Academicals, in that it's missing a bit of extra polish and doesn't flow as well as the Golden Age books. I blame the Embuggerance."
discworld,39keka,Pelinore,3,Fri Jun 12 13:21:35 2015 UTC,"I think rather it's because in Raising Steam, Dick is the central character.

discworld,39keka,randomguy186,3,Fri Jun 12 17:18:13 2015 UTC,"That's how I feel as well.  He's a fine character, but his stories are interesting because of everything that goes on, he just kind of gets swept along. He's no force of nature like Granny, Death, or Vimes."
discworld,39keka,BriscoMorgan,4,Sat Jun 13 02:26:19 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. Moist is a fascinating character, but he's what brought me into Disk World in the first place, so maybe I'm biased.   He, much like Vimes, begins his journey with many flaws. As his story went on he overcame flaws while also learning to play his strengths (Although I can't say the same for Granny, who blessedly never changes).  I would probably also include Carrot. Even though Vimes is the character people focus on in the Guards books, I think Carrot is equally interesting. I know that he's supposed to provide a foil much like Nanny does in the Witches books, but Carrot's character growth just from ""Guards Guards"" to ""Men at Arms"" is fascinating (especially the bit at the end with Ventinari and the throne)."

discworld,39fnjc,I_burned_my_arm,6,Thu Jun 11 22:02:04 2015 UTC,"I appear to have a lump in my throat. He was awesome as the voice of death, and did you hear his heavy metal album. Wasn't my cup of tea, but I thought it was fabulous that he just went ahead and made it anyway! What a fantastic man, and a great loss."
discworld,39i9v4,hermitowl,7,Thu Jun 11 22:16:25 2015 UTC,"You can read in any order and start anywhere, generally.  There are characters in multiple books who develop over a series but it is not vital to start with The Colour of Magic. There's a few trilogies dotted around as well, but again, its all explained as you go.  I started with Hogfather and was immediately hooked, but read a few of the books after that before going all the way back to the start and reading in order.  You get more out of them by doing it in order, but it is in no way vital.  I'd go as far as to say don't start with TCoM as it's by no means his strongest work."
discworld,39i9v4,bigolslabomeat,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:24:01 2015 UTC,"Will do :) Thanks.  I was actually thinking about starting with ""Soul Music""."
discworld,39i9v4,PinkyPankyPonky,3,Thu Jun 11 22:32:57 2015 UTC,"Soul Music is a brilliant book and you will thoroughly enjoy it. If you are intending to read all the books though, or a good chunk of them, it would usually be recommended to read Mort first. Mort is one you would always be recommended to read at some point and it provides the full backstory for the main character Susan. Though you dont need to by any means."
discworld,39i9v4,batty3108,2,Fri Jun 12 07:30:27 2015 UTC,"There are some distinct 'series' within the books, and some that are stand-alone.  This graphic shows how the different books are aligned and connected.  To properly 'dive in', I'd recommend getting into one of the distinct Series, as they make it easier to really get into the world and see how it changes.  My favourites are the Watch books - the first one I ever read was Night Watch - so I'd recommend these (so start with Guards, Guards!) or the Death series (starting with Mort).   This said, most of the books can be read in isolation without too much trouble. They're more fun if you know the continuity, but they're still good if you don't."
discworld,39i9v4,ScottyDug,2,Fri Jun 12 10:45:48 2015 UTC,I know each book can be read as a standalone but as a series I would recommend reading them in publication order.   My reason is to see the evolution of not just the characters but of Sir Pterrys writing style too. The Discworld of the later books is a very different beast to the first couple. He seemed to move away from out and out fantasy (remember L Space?) to real world commentary with a fantasy twist.
discworld,39i9v4,Jammintk,1 point,Fri Jun 12 11:03:10 2015 UTC,"If I recall, L-space was introduced well after he had gotten his style down."
discworld,39i9v4,coldandwet,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:03:04 2015 UTC,"One of his great skills as a writer was to frame each story in a way that it could be read as a stand alone book. Each time we meet a recurring character, or place, or system (like guilds or magic) he beautifully describes them with an economy of words so that it gives all the relevant imagery and information without felling at all repetitive to readers who know it already.   'Soul Music' is as good a place to start as any. It is the start of the Susan books (unless you also count 'Mort'). I am sure you will love it, Susan is a great character.  I started with 'Wyrd Sisters' and was hooked. I have also recommended people to start at 'Guards, Guards', or the smaller single books like 'Moving Pictures', 'Pyramids' or 'Small Gods'.  But really anywhere you start will be fine to enjoy your journey through Diskworld."
discworld,39i9v4,Doc_Dish,1 point,Fri Jun 12 00:08:28 2015 UTC,"I started (a long, long time ago!) with The Light Fantastic which is a direct sequel to The Colour of Magic and I didn't lose anything by doing so.

discworld,39i9v4,msut77,1 point,Fri Jun 12 08:46:10 2015 UTC,"I started with Mort which is fine by itself.  I recommended a friend to read the watch books slightly out of order, start with Men at Arms and after read guards guards as the prequel origin story."
discworld,39i9v4,Three_Headed_Monkey,1 point,Fri Jun 12 10:01:53 2015 UTC,"The order I read them in was the order they became available at the library. It still worked, and I could easily fill in the gaps as I went. Each story is self contained and all relevant character details that you need to know are presented in a way that both introduces them to new readers without feeling like a recap to those who are up to date.  After owning all the books I would just pick at random to decide what I would read next, or choose based on how long it had been since a read. It took a few years to realise that I had never read them all in order, so I've done that a few times now, too"

The Step Reckoner (or Stepped Reckoner) was a digital mechanical calculator invented by German mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz around 1672 and completed in 1694.  The name comes from the translation of the German term for its operating mechanism; staffelwalze meaning 'stepped drum'. It was the first calculator that could perform all four arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.   Its intricate precision gearwork, however, was somewhat beyond the fabrication technology of the time; mechanical problems, in addition to a design flaw in the carry mechanism, prevented the machines from working reliably.

It is, however, advisable to pick one of the first books in one of the subseries or one of the standalone titles. My picks would be    Guards! Guards! Equal Rites  Mort Pyramids  Small Gods  Monstrous Regiment  Going Postal  Unseen Academicals    Out if these, however, the best are probably Small Gods, Mort, Going Postal, and Monstrous Regiment. Read the synopses of the books I mentioned and pick the one your group is most likely to enjoy."
discworld,3922lj,Jammintk,15,Mon Jun 8 19:00:29 2015 UTC,Wyrd Sisters is also a good entry to the Witches' subseries. You don't need to know what happens in Equal Rites to enjoy it.

discworld,3922lj,Wheaties-Of-Doom,8,Tue Jun 9 04:38:01 2015 UTC,"The Wee Free Men is also a good place to start. It was written as a young adult tie-in, so references to the greater body of work are about minimal. It's were I started, and since then I've been hooked."

discworld,3922lj,Computing_Dunce,3,Tue Jun 9 04:42:35 2015 UTC,"My favourite ""stand alone"" book of the Discworld series is Mort.  Granted it's got a special place in my heart because it's the first one I read.  As a general rule, most of the books hold their own and reading them in order isn't that important but with perhaps a few exceptions.  The main one I'd say was Vimes and the Watch because 1)  Guards Guards! is the introduction of Carrot and 2) it helps to read them in order because of the running gag of Vimes' continued promotion against his will.  However, the various adventures of characters such as Rincewind and the witches don't necessarily need to be read in order because each adventure doesn't require a knowledge of the previous one, but it does help.  Small Gods is another very good stand alone book."
discworld,3922lj,Arch27,3,Tue Jun 9 12:53:42 2015 UTC,"As you've discovered, the series is really just a lot of stories in the same setting with some minor intertwined events, settings and characters. There isn't much that carries over to other books, though reading the earlier ones will spark that 'a-ha!' moment when you're reading a later novel and you already know what they're talking about when they reference something from the past (he does that often, but also explains it often in footnotes).  As others have said, there are 'themes' and you're best to start at the beginning of one of them.    Mort starts the Death subset. Guards! Guards! starts the (ahem) Guards subset. Equal Rites starts the Witches subset, though as many have said Wyrd Sisters is a bit of a better start given that it has less references to earlier books. Not that there's much reference anyway, but this one really seems more like a stand-alone book.   I have a soft spot for Mort and Equal Rites because aside from The Colour of Magic/The Light Fantastic these two really cemented my love for the setting. Incidentally, those were the first four books: Colour of Magic, Light Fantastic, Equal Rites and Mort.  Good luck and welcome aboard the Disc."
discworld,3922lj,mzglitter,2,Tue Jun 9 12:56:14 2015 UTC,For  my own book club I chose Guards Guards as a good basic intro to the Discworld. If you want to create a little more energetic discussion I would go with Small Gods.

Archchancelor Mustrum Ridcully paused with his long-handled scrubbing brush hovering down his back, and stared around.  shortly after Ridcully strode through the open doors of the library. ""What's going on here"" he demanded The Watchmen turned, and stared. A large blob of foam, which up until that point had been performing sterling service in the cause of the essential decencies, slipped slowly to the floor.   And these two bit from the courtroom scene in Making Money  context: the chairman of the Royal Bank is a small, ugly, wheezy dog, bequeathed the title by the former chairman's wife who was a a little Ogg-esque. The little toy may or may not be a giant vibrating black dildo   It was at this point that Moist became aware of a regrettably familiar whirring sound, and from his raised position he was the first to see the chairman of the Royal Bank appear from behind the curtains at the far end of the hall with his wonderful new toy clamped firmly in his mouth. Some trick of the vibrations was propelling Mr Fusspot backwards across the shiny marble.  People in the audience craned their necks as, with tail wagging, the little dog passed behind Vetinari's chair and disappeared behind the curtains on the opposite side.   context: mad accountant/Spoiler is attempting to throw a pie in Vetinari's face - Moist leaps in it's path to take the bullet/pie as not doing so would ultimately lead to him unable to fulfil his life-long ambition of seeing tomorrow   As in a silent dream he sailed towards the oncoming nemesis, reaching out with snail-pace fingers while the pie spun on to its date with history.  It hit him in the face.  Vetinari had not moved. Custard flew up and four hundred fascinated eyes watched as a glob of the stuff headed towards the Patrician, who caught it in an upraised hand. The little smack as it landed on his palm was the only sound in the room.  Vetinari inspected the captured custard. He dipped his finger into it and tasted the blob thereon. He cast his eyes upwards, thoughtfully, while the room held its communal breath, and then said pensively:'I do believe it is pineapple'    The reason I love those so much is they're all perfect example of how great a comedy writer this guy is. He can write with perfect comic timing. He understands comedy. He knows when alliteration is funny (captured custard), he can perfectly capture physical comedy and turn it into letters on paper without losing a single iota of the funny. He knows the exact words to use so that our brains somehow process what we're reading through the bits that tell us to laugh while watching the Three Stooges or the Marx Brothers.  He's a genius and one of the greatest comedians of our time."

He and Vimes basically ran in the same circles as kids but moved on to other (and different) things. Willikins in Snuff was a loyal thug."

It's similar to the way he efficiently kills someone with an ice knife in Thud! then apologises for the mess.

I read the first 3, in part because I am a Pratchett junkie and had been through all but the young adult ones which im saving to read with a little cousin in a year or so.  Didn't love them but it was an interesting concept and world to explore. There's a plot but I think it really just serves as a vehicle for the thought experiment. I didn't feel invested in the outcome.  Unlike Good Omens which definitely had a lot of Terry's voice, I think in the Long Earth his influence is in the set up. Lobsang as a character is the kind of absurd creation you'd expect in Discworld, and you can imagine how he would be introduced with ridiculous commentary and asides, but despite how wacky his concept is ( Im trying to be vague enough not to spoil) he's essentially played straight. Same with some of the other characters' quirks and some of the worlds visited.  Did not regret reading, but did not scratch Discworld itch  (ninja edits correcting some grammar and autocorrects)"

discworld,38qvun,deded55,1 point,Sat Jun 6 18:38:06 2015 UTC,"If you have not done so already, you must read Good Omens. It is by both Pratchett and Neil Gaiman, and it is truly the best blend of both of them. You know it's good when both authors can barely tell who wrote which bit. Seriously, I can't tell you how many times I've read that book. I can tell you I've given a copy of it to half a dozen people, and recommended it to many more. I've never had anyone come back and say they didn't like it. This being Reddit, I'm sure someone will pop up with a comment, but still. Read it. EDIT: Also, if you liked The Long Earth, there's a book Stephen Baxter cowrote with Arthur C Clarke, called The Light of Other Days. It's definitely more hard science fiction, but it's also really good. Better hard sci-fi than The Long Earth, in my opinion, but that's because it's what both authors do, instead of hard sci-fi and humor/satire."
discworld,38qvun,greymonk,12,Sat Jun 6 19:09:17 2015 UTC,"It took me a while to get used to them. Each book covers up to ten years and follows multiple characters whose stories only barely connect if at all. At first I found this really frustrating because it felt like I only just getting to know someone before getting whisked to a place a million Earths away to follow someone else you barely know. But over the course of the book/s the stories and characters slowly build up and you find you do care about what they're doing and you enjoy their company.   Before you read The Long Earth series you should read Pratchett's short story, The High Meggas which you'll find in his short story collection A Blink Of The Screen. This is like the faetus of The Long Earth. Also read Strata and The Dark Side of the Sun, to get your head used to Terry Pratchett writing science fiction. If you have time I recommend reading some of Baxter's books too. The Long Earth often gets dissed for not being Pratchetty enough (I dare say there's a Baxter forum somewhere on the internet where people are complaining about Pratchett's bits), but it was written by two brilliant very different authors, one of whom is writing a different style to what we're used to. If you approach it with this in mind you'll enjoy it much more.   Also, you should know when you jump into The Long Earth that the world(s) itself feels like one of the characters. You care as much about the Long Earth as you do for any of the people on it. This is especially true of the later books. Most of characters do have Pratchettesque tinges too them (a Harley Davidson riding Keats quoting nun who the Pope refers to as 'a worthy opponent'; a Tibetan mechanic reincarnated as artificial intelligence; an atheist reverend who loves GK Chesterton) but the way the books are written doesn't allow for the full Pratchett experience. As I said before the world itself is so rich and fascinating that this is actually ok. It would be a shame to create an infinite amount of Earths, set humanity loose on them and only get to see it through the eyes of a few people for a few years. Everything about the Long Earth series is huge, slow and epic, like a Diplodocus walking and I definitely recommend them."
discworld,38qvun,Danimeh,7,Sat Jun 6 04:06:01 2015 UTC,"To me, the books feel like they've been getting more Baxtery and less Pratchetty as the series has progressed, which is only to be expected I guess.  Still enjoyable though."
discworld,38qvun,Doc_Dish,3,Sat Jun 6 11:49:29 2015 UTC,I def had a couple of little bits that feel inspired by terry and a some great concepts. I enjoyed the series and will get this one as well but it doesn't have any real pratchett feel.
discworld,38qvun,Largenlumpy,3,Sat Jun 6 01:58:55 2015 UTC,"The first book was pretty good; it spent a lot of time exploring the ramifications of the setting (discovery of dimensional travel) and its impact on society and is pretty interesting. These are the parts where Terry's influence is most apparent.  The sequels focus primarily on the narrative of the characters, which is more lackluster. Plus there is a big twist/reveal at the end of the first book that is almost completely ignored in the sequels.

In that sense, it's nice that such collaborations occur from time to time. ""Good Omens"" got me into reading Neil Gaiman's work as well, which I think is great."

Following up from the 1st 3 Long Earth books, I read The Light of Other Days (co-written with Arthur C. Clarke, which you might know of Space Odyssey fame). Fantastic book. Much more serious than the ones written together with Sir Terry of course, but I will definitely read more of him."

The world-building is almost all Terry, the rules for stepping are Terry's, Lobsang (of course), and I know the story arcs were worked out between the two authors from the start.  Stephen Baxter has a sense of humor; I don't know if I could tell which of the ""jokers"" were Terry's and which were Stephen's.  Keep in mind the 5th Long Earth book in 2016 will be Terry's last chance for a Footnote (unless there's a trove of unpublished ""miscellaneous"" in a drawer somewhere, though he was keen to publish anything he felt worthy)."

The first books came out so long ago that the versions my friends and I consider to be 'definitive' are the paperback ones with original artwork. E.g.: The Light Fantastic.   I suppose tracking down first editions could be done, but not inexpensively. (Edit: my housemate is currently assembling a first edition collection of all the Tiffany Aching series, but they're relatively new.)  Everyone I know seems to have a proper hodge-podge of Pratchett styles on their bookshelves!"
discworld,381nqw,HarlequinValentine,5,Mon Jun 1 08:15:35 2015 UTC,"I think most people think of the original artwork versions (by Josh Kirby or Paul Kidby) as definitive or at least as the most recognisable. They did all come out in hardback I think, but most of them you can only get secondhand and it can be difficult/expensive to track them down.  The Discworld Collector's Library might be a better bet - they're a nice series of new hardbacks. But they're unfortunately only available as far as Jingo at the moment because a different publisher holds the rights after that. http://www.discworldemporium.com/books/Discworld%20Collector's%20Library"

It was created some time after the rest of the Discworld by the old man who carries the universe in a sack.

It's about people and caring for them. She does that for Granny Weatherwax and all the other witches. Talks to them, cares for them, is always there to clean up a mess or (metaphorically) cut toenails. In that aspect I think she is quite powerful.

As mentioned in Maskerade, she could get a statue to cry on her shoulder and tell her what it really thought of pigeons.

discworld,37yfll,CdrVimes,20,Sun May 31 20:26:36 2015 UTC,"I think it comes down to the meaning of ""power"". While Granny Weatherwax is the most powerful of the Lancre witches in a conventionally magical sense, Nanny Ogg's power lies in finding the levers that make people tick. She can get people to open up, she is comfortable in any environment, and frequently uses her people skills to overcome obstacles rather than rely on magical assistance. In the Discworld, magic is shown time and again as something not to be trusted, where as an understanding of people is an immense source of power for all the main characters in different ways (look at how Vetinari uses his understanding of the Ankh Morpork mentality to make the city work)."
discworld,37yfll,tegularius00,18,Sun May 31 17:22:53 2015 UTC,"Granny Weatherwax has total mastery over magic and control, but Nanny's power comes from the fact that she is the one keeping Granny in line, and Granny relies on this because she knows that she could have all to easily turned out like her sister did."

However, I would also say that, whilst Nanny definitely performs this role for Granny, the real person watching Granny is Granny herself. I'd argue that Vimes isn't the only one with the Guarding Dark inside him!  (On a side note, wouldn't it have been amazing to have had Vimes and Granny meet each other? You get a sense they would just understand each other implicitly.)"

Like Susan + Vimes, or Tiffany and Vimes (which they do, but for a few precious and immaculate seconds).  Imagine Vimes in a witches book, fighting alongside them with his magical police deductive powers.  I try not to think much about that because I get excited and then I get sad."

discworld,37yfll,beleaguered_penguin,5,Mon Jun 1 12:21:35 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. Granny Weatherwax is a total badass, but it's Nanny Ogg who (with her more 'worldly experience') keeps her in check."
discworld,37yfll,tegularius00,11,Sun May 31 19:36:47 2015 UTC,"I think there are four main reasons:  1) Granny Ogg is famous for her cooking and thus her knowledge of local flora and fauna and its actual ( Maybe scientific) effects on people's ailments. Allowing her to actually help many people. 2) A with is only important to her community if she is a part of it , while remaining mysterious. Gytha had many children who worked with the rest of the normal folk , she truly was a member of the community. Which also had the affect of cementing her respect and place within that community.  3) ""Headology"" requires a great charisma to fully pull off, Something Gytha had the most of, thus for someone to be viewed as the most powerful she must be able to call upon that charisma as well as her skill with herbs etc  4) Nanny Ogg is among the most important witches already she is the one that gets actively involved with peoples stories. Thus she makes herself important to the other Witches including being Weatherwaxes best friend - in my mind the second most powerful witch, as well as the people she looks after. While not all like her she is well respected.  That's my theory anyway"
discworld,37yfll,Staithe121,13,Sun May 31 13:46:10 2015 UTC,"He says it in Art Of Discworld: ""I've always suspected that Nanny is, deep down, the most powerful of the witches and part of her charm lies in the way she prevents people from finding this out."""

Quite honestly, Esme Weatherwax is outstandingly my favourite of the Witches (With Tiffany Aching a close second...) But I accept that Nanny is the Vetinari to Esme's Vimes."
discworld,37yfll,Panzer170,9,Sun May 31 21:50:08 2015 UTC,Granny says several times in various books that she doesn't have nearly as much raw power as Nanny or her sister but she does have such absolute control over herself and her power that she can do more with her little bit than anyone else on the disc. I remove most of equal rites from continuity because the magical duel seems so out of character for what she became.
discworld,37yfll,Largenlumpy,5,Sun May 31 19:22:20 2015 UTC,"But in the magical duel, she only ever really counters doesn't she?  It's still about her control and how she uses brains rather than brute force to keep deflecting & overpowering Cutangle."

And its hooves clattered on the cobbles. Ridcully couldn't help noticing how they shone.    It walked politely alongside the witch until she reached the centre of the square. Then she turned it loose, and gave it a light slap on the rump.    It whinnied softly, turned, and galloped down the street, toward the forest...    Nanny Ogg appeared silently behind Granny Weatherwax as she watched it go.    ""Silver shoes?"" she said quietly ""They'll last no time at all.""    ""And silver nails. They'll last for long enough,"" said Granny, speaking to the world in general. ""And she'll never get it back, though she calls it for a thousand years.""

Iron prevents the fairies from being able to interact with the unicorn, but as a fey creature it doesn't particularly enjoy iron itself. By making sure the iron only touches the underside of the hooves while using silver to hold them in place, it blocks their influence over the unicorn without causing harm.  That's how I interpreted it, anyway. IANTP."

discworld,37yl2r,TranshumansFTW,5,Mon Jun 1 10:06:24 2015 UTC,"There are a bunch of reasons:   Historically, when you shoe an animal it indicates it has been broken. Due to the strong narrative convention of the Discworld, when you shoe a unicorn you've broken it. Of course, this is only temporary whilst the shoes last, but once it's been broken by humans it can never be a truly elvish creature again. Thus, once it's been shoed once, it's been ""marked"" as human, and the Queen can never get it back no matter how hard she tries.  The shoes were iron, the nails were silver. Keeping iron close to the feet of an elvish creature breaks it, because whilst the iron is not inside the animal, it is close enough that it dulls its mind, making it weak and ineffectual. The silver nails were necessary because iron nails would have killed it.  This is Granny Weatherwax we're talking about. She's as bad as Miss Treason when it comes to making a good story. However, unlike Miss Treason, she wants to be seen as the good one if she can be because she never got the CHANCE to be the bad one (see ""Witches Abroad"")."

Frequent during the 18th and 19th centuries and probably earlier, it survived into the 20th century in a few places, such as Rampton, Nottinghamshire (1909),  Middleton Cheney (1909) and Blisworth (1920s and 1936), Northamptonshire.

discworld,37t2ta,autowikibot,4,Sat May 30 15:18:52 2015 UTC,"Wait, the Tiffany Aching novels are YA? I've read two of them on my e-reader and didn't realise that they were different from the rest."
discworld,37t2ta,ThiaTheYounger,3,Sat May 30 12:50:37 2015 UTC,"Kind of fits with Pratchetts idea that kids are simple not stupid. They can handle complex concepts (i.e 'lies to children') but the delivery need to be moderated so that doesn't require as much background knowledge. Rangers Apprentice is decent at this; solid writing, decent  look at morals, doesn't shy away from adult themes."
discworld,37t2ta,Sgt_Colon,3,Sun May 31 09:01:56 2015 UTC,"The Tiffany Aching novels are, while technically young adult, very well written.   They also have music by steeleye span to accompany them!"
discworld,37t2ta,Tiffany_Aching,3,Sat May 30 13:36:49 2015 UTC,"What??   Au contraire, they have even more social commentary than most other Discworld books, and are pretty damn dark.  In any case, I would say they are less subtle, but because the subjects they deal with, they should."
discworld,37t2ta,kataskopo,6,Sat May 30 15:15:45 2015 UTC,Nation is absolutely phenomenal.

I personally don't find them any more simplified than the main series, and I think they are actually darker and more upsetting in some places."
discworld,37t2ta,HarlequinValentine,3,Sat May 30 09:15:17 2015 UTC,"In any case, those books are concentrated and distilled Discworld. Specially the Tiffany Aching books, they are one of my favorite Discworld series.  I don't even think I would have noticed if they weren't marketed as YA. They are tight, focused, and immensely enjoyable."
discworld,37t2ta,kataskopo,1 point,Sat May 30 15:14:03 2015 UTC,"Their main characters are teenagers.  And they're a little shorter, and have chapters.    They're just as good.  The Tiffany Aching books are some of my favorite of Pratchett's books."
discworld,37t2ta,Digger-of-Tunnels,1 point,Sun May 31 00:21:20 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I enjoyed them more. The only real difference is that they tend to follow younger characters, and sometimes the big words are defined in the text.  For example: ""Susurrus…according to her grandmother’s dictionary, it meant ‘a low soft sound, as of whispering or muttering’.  Tiffany liked the taste of the word.  It made her think of mysterious people in long cloaks whispering important secrets behind a door…susurrususssurrusss…"" (Wee Free Men)"
discworld,37t2ta,mringham,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:39:16 2015 UTC,My whole reading life I've always just assumed Discworld as a whole was a YA series. Very little that's dealt with is beyond the general targets for YA novels.
discworld,37rymh,wanna_run,6,Fri May 29 22:21:20 2015 UTC,"Start with one of the four on the left - ""X NOVELS"".   Although my personal recommendation is Colour of Magic, even though the first couple of books aren't as good as the rest, I think publication order is best. But others recommend other lines. I think the most commonly recommended is Guards! Guards!, i.e. the Watch Novels line."
discworld,37rymh,emeraldreactor,4,Fri May 29 22:26:00 2015 UTC,"The idea is that you start with any of the orangey starter novels, then follow the line to the right from that. Once you've finished that storyline, you can find another starter book and follow its line.  But my personal recommendation for starting out is to pick basically ANY book in the universe that sounds interesting to you and start there. With very few exceptions (raising steam, snuff, the light fantastic), you really don't need to have any of the previous books to fully enjoy a Discworld novel."
discworld,37rymh,mustardsteve,2,Sat May 30 00:58:49 2015 UTC,"That's how I started off reading the books. I believe I started with Mort, then Guards! Guards!, followed by Night Watch, Moving Pictures and Reaper Man. Oh Small Gods was in there somewhere, as well. It really helps you to get a feel of the big broad Discworld reading them at random and skipping around the different locations. When I was 100% convinced I was in love with these novels, thinking of starting a collection, then I switched to publication order.   I've got to say, I really am glad I didn't start with The Colour of Magic. It was enjoyable, and I might have given a few more books a shot, but the books that follow it just honestly feel way more fun to read."
discworld,37rymh,kataskopo,2,Sat May 30 04:00:58 2015 UTC,"As others have said, start with the starter novels and follow the line.  I read (waltzed, devoured) the Night Watch books first, then read everything else in published order, because it's true that you can see the world evolve and grow."
discworld,37rymh,Maximus-city,1 point,Sat May 30 15:18:16 2015 UTC,"Welp, I picked up Guards! Guards! at the library today, so we'll see how that goes. I'm excited to get into this series!"
discworld,37rymh,outsider,1 point,Sat May 30 16:34:33 2015 UTC,"I think that Guards! Guards! is a pretty perfect starting point. You can then work your way through the rest of the Watch books (in order of course) and then perhaps go to the first Discworld book (The Colour of Magic) and start to read every book from the beginning. You'll then have a great view on how Terry's writing rapidly develops and matures from the rather ""bitty"" first two Discworld books (The Colour of Magic and The Light Fantastic)."

discworld,37pc7z,pratchettjob,3,Fri May 29 10:02:37 2015 UTC,"I like Monstrous Regiment, though I'm not exactly sure why.  It sticks out in my mind, and I think it's because it's different.  We get a different protagonist than the usual from the main series (though the Watch threaten to steal the show in the chapters they appear in).  I like Polly.  Outside of the Witches, there aren't any female central protagonists.  She reminds me of Tiffany: she finds the situation she waded into is deeper than she thought, but she doesn't shirk and does what needs to be done.  In fact, all of the minor characters get developed.  (I mean, can you really describe the character of the Lecturer in Recent Runes?)  I like the themes.  The events move along at a decent pace."
discworld,37pc7z,jgf1123,9,Sat May 30 01:33:28 2015 UTC,Because it is really hard work to read. I think Pratchett got more and more dogmatic as his career went on - it was only the Tiffany books and Going Postal - that had the lightness of touch of his early work.  You are really hit over the head with the morals of the book for the first three quarters. It gets a bit oppressive up until the big reveal of how the generals are women. Then it gets complicated as you question everything you have read. And you work out it's a great book.  It's a strange one though. I loved it in retrospect but really slogged through it at the time.  What do you all think of it? Thanks for the clicks and upvotes :)
discworld,37pc7z,air8orne,14,Fri May 29 10:04:57 2015 UTC,"It's one of my favorites! I love the Characters... Yes, it's dark because those crazys things happening in it, are so close to the madness of the real world... Nuggan and his Abominations, the Girls House, Wars in general... In the end the outcome is great... Shame that there wasn't any more Books about Polly Perks."
discworld,37pc7z,ThiaTheYounger,3,Fri May 29 10:44:05 2015 UTC,"Also one of my favorites. Yes, it's a bit heavy on the message, but not too heavy for me. I love Pratchett when he shows the absurdity of reality."
discworld,37pc7z,kataskopo,3,Fri May 29 17:23:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the message was super heavy, but that's because it's fucking important. It has been important through history and will always be."
discworld,37pc7z,ThiaTheYounger,3,Fri May 29 20:01:55 2015 UTC,Amen.
discworld,37pc7z,taocn,3,Fri May 29 20:22:18 2015 UTC,"Yes, exactly. I disagree that it's a polemic; I'd say it's an effective illustration.  Pratchett realizes that he's writing for an audience of which half—possibly more?—haven't experienced sexism personally, and thus needs to be sure his point is clear."
discworld,37pc7z,kataskopo,2,Sat May 30 01:30:19 2015 UTC,"I think that's what makes it so interesting to me, it's a completely different experience and assumptions, stuff that I will never have because I'm not a girl.  Heh, actually I think it was the first time I felt that slight inability to connect with the Witches and Tiffany because they were female.  I mean, it's not that bad, but is that what most girls experience when they look up to male figures?  Would I like to be with one of the Witches, or to be one of them?  Neat stuff."
discworld,37pc7z,_lilPoundcake,1 point,Sat May 30 02:06:46 2015 UTC,"I mean, it's not that bad, but is that what most girls experience when they look up to male figures?   late to the thread, but no  the default hero is male, with the assumption that women can empathise with men but men cannot empathise with women. because there are no other heroes, women just have to learn  hopefully with more equal entertainment, both sexes will know how to empathise with the other sex"

discworld,37pc7z,quondam47,2,Fri May 29 20:00:56 2015 UTC,My main problem with it was there were so many times you were being banged over the head with THE MESSAGE that it got a bit tiresome.  The last quarter or so was brilliant. I think more fondly of it now than then.
discworld,37pc7z,Slavic_Genghis,2,Fri May 29 10:46:32 2015 UTC,A bit like Snuff. I loved the book but THE MESSAGE of 'racism is bad' did take anyway from it a little bit.

The other major problem I have with this book is it didn't need to be set on the Disc. Its seems like he had an idea for a story that tried to force into the existing Discworld, it just felt out of place."
discworld,37pc7z,The_Bone_Rat,2,Sat May 30 08:15:47 2015 UTC,"I loved it when it came out, and I still do.  For me, it always worked better as a book about the military than a book a feminism. Polly learning how to be a soldier, the dynamics of a squad, the realities of war - all of that stuff is just great, and there's a real sense of threat throughout the novel.   Yes, the central message is a little heavy handed, but I found Polly to be such an engaging character, and her story to be so compelling that I didn't really mind."
discworld,37pc7z,Dommeister,1 point,Sat May 30 09:17:06 2015 UTC,"I think the heavy handed feminism is what made me dislike the book so much. I know Pratchett was trying to say a message or something about it, but the whole ""Girl Power"" thing was just a bit too much. Now, as a military book, it wasn't too bad. It just seemed a bit different than the other books in the Discworld series and Polly wasn't as memorable a protagonist to me."

In popular culture of article  LNER Class A3 4472 Flying Scotsman:       Because of the LNER's emphasis on using the locomotive for publicity purposes, and then its eventful preservation history, including two international forays, it is one of the UK's most recognised locomotives. One of its first film appearances was in the 1929 film The Flying Scotsman, which featured an entire sequence set aboard the locomotive.   In 1986, Flying Scotsman appeared in a British Rail TV advert.  Flying Scotsman was featured in The Railway Series books by the Rev. W. Awdry. The locomotive visited the fictional Island of Sodor in the book Enterprising Engines to visit its only remaining brother: Gordon. At this time it had two tenders, and this was a key feature of the plot of one of the stories, ""Tenders for Henry"". When the story was filmed for the television series Thomas & Friends, renamed as ""Tender Engines"" only Flying Scotsman's two tenders were seen outside a shed.  He originally was intended to have a larger role in this episode, but because of budgetary constraints, the modelling crew could not afford to build the entire engine.

Never doubt what malicious stupidity lies in the heart of man, doubly so that it will bleed out to burn down a goddamned home.   People may of had a good reason to be unhappy but doesn't give you an excuse to start chucking cobblestones at some poor bastard just because he has a badge. Average people got caught in the middle of it, average nobodies who did nothing but try to make a living and they were the ones who paid.  But then there are fine few who try to make a difference. Not some two bit thug driving the rabid mob off himself and onto his neighbor, no it's the honest few tried to prevent hell from getting worse, tried to stop it from happening. It those few as a godsdamn mother from stopping her idiot son making things worse, the clergy getting off their arse actually practising the good they preach and those who kept their head whilst others lost theirs.   End of the day it ain't good versus bad, that's the kind of crap bastards in their comfy bloody chairs argue about whilst they've never seen what happens outside their bloody door. No, it's bad things happened, because of stupid people and its the average jack that cops it whilst ignorant bastards stand around and try and project their bigotry on it. At the end of the day it's always the average bastard that loses.   ~ I'm aware that his is a somewhat contentious issue, so your opinion may vary (greatly).

Would just point out that while you want to maintain a consistent tone for a monologue with one driving message, and use language that fits the character, you probably want to avoid repeating the same words and phrases so many times. And for Vimes, a man generally not given to long speeches, I think you repeat essentially the same thought a few times. Try to make sentences much more terse when possible.   I.E. ""A few bad coppers can make the people turn on the whole watch. But a mob's a mob. There's no justice in it. Put a mam and her sweet babe between the mob and what they're after and they'll go right on chucking cobblestones never mind who gets hurt.  We don't sort out good and bad. Coppers don't put people on trial. That's why we try everything we can to take 'em in alive. Get a copper starts passing the death sentence on somebody on account of his horse cart is blocking the road, well that's how you get mobs. Our job ain't deciding who was right and who was wrong. Our job is to keep. The people. Safe. All of 'em. Even the ones trying to pitchfork us, we keep them safe, too. That's our job. Because if we stop trying to keep them safe, and keep them alive, we're just an Official mob. And if our mob gets mixed up with theirs, we'll have a riot on our hands, and I don't intend to live through another of those."""

discworld,36z6xt,FixBayonetsLads,13,Sat May 23 10:52:45 2015 UTC,"The Rincewind books are a bit of an acquired taste, I usually recommend people start with Guards! Guards! or Wyrd Sisters rather than publishing order for this reason."
discworld,36z6xt,UtterEast,10,Sat May 23 14:18:04 2015 UTC,"It may be because he introduced me to the Discworld; but, Rincewind is still my favorite character.  Though, I tend to like anti-heroes."
discworld,36z6xt,sylver_dragon,3,Sat May 23 14:16:22 2015 UTC,"Rincewind isn't really an antihero though, he's more of a reluctant hero."

discworld,36z6xt,SilentWorlder,7,Sat May 23 23:00:05 2015 UTC,"In a similiar vein I've never liked Susan. I've always found her to be somewhat arrogant and abrasive, and her debut in Reaper Man felt she was filled with arbitrary scepticism. Problem is, unlike OP I've never really been able to reconcile this in any way, hell I even hated her in Hogfather and Thief of time. I don't know, it probably just irks me that every other protagonist I enjoy but Susan is the black sheep of the lot.  (End rant.)"

discworld,36z6xt,reenethefiend,12,Sat May 23 13:44:56 2015 UTC,It's revealed that due to the Green Lady's meddling his hour glass has so many twists and ways to reverse sand Death uses it as desk art.

discworld,36z6xt,AlwaysSayHi,2,Sat May 23 14:57:00 2015 UTC,Nigel Planer would be a great Rincewind. I thought Jason was brilliant as Albert too. I also envisioned Twoflower as an elderly Japanese man.

A character I'm still having a hard time liking his Vimes, but I was never particularly interested in the Night Watch story arc."
discworld,36z6xt,The_Bone_Rat,3,Sat May 23 20:17:39 2015 UTC,"Interesting. Vimes is my favorite character in all of fiction because he's incorruptible, but not in a special heroic way like Carrot, but because he got it the hard way"
discworld,36z6xt,The_Bone_Rat,1 point,Sat May 23 20:42:05 2015 UTC,"Vimes' arc was the last I really read since it held the lowest interest for me. Don't get me wrong, Vimes is an amazing character, but Death, the wiz(z)ards, and witches were what really drew me to the novels."

When our visibly disheveled reporter suggested that the enchanted Luggage might have been sent as an assassination attempt on the minister's life, no doubt indicating a dark mysterious past that the public was yet unaware of, minister Rincewind simply replied with a long, wary sigh.   Our very own miss Skeeter promises to get to the bottom of this, despite minister Rincewind's claims that he is ""not entirely sure if there even is a bottom inside there, you wouldn't believe the stuff he's swallowed""."

I dropped three hundred or so off at the charity shop a while ago and it didn't make a dent (but at least I can get most of them on the shelves now rather than stacked up the walls)  I'll keep my favourite thousand or so :)

The second was old age catching up to me and finding it much easier to listen to book recordings than to try and read.  So, sadly I don't have printed copies of the last 8 or so Discworld books. But I am so proud of myself, I just got the paperback ""Turtle Recall"" and am actually reading again!  A joy to realize I remember how."

discworld,36v058,pratchettjob,6,Fri May 22 10:03:25 2015 UTC,"I genuinely think these are the best books of the tail end of Pratchett's career. I LOVE Going Postal and think Monstrous Regiment fascinating, but these books have the wit and warmth of the early Discworld novels. Except Terry is a much much better writer than he was 30 Discworld books ago.  What do you think of these? How do they compare for you to the other Discworld novels?"
discworld,36v058,kataskopo,7,Fri May 22 10:04:39 2015 UTC,"Yes, I love them too. I love the themes and the morals on these ones, and I want to recommend them to every child I know (even though most of them don't read in English yet!)  Also, I can't even imagine how a 9 year old kid can do all those things! I'm not sure even I could right now, in my early twenties!"
discworld,36v058,Tiffany_Aching,4,Fri May 22 15:05:58 2015 UTC,"I think it's partly because she was 9. nine year olds have a worldview that anything that they do is possible, which according to narrativium means they can."
discworld,36v058,kataskopo,3,Fri May 22 19:46:43 2015 UTC,"I think that's my question, do 9 year olds have that kind of worldview? I haven't been around many of them, so maybe that's why it's surprising.  I'm not even sure if I had that kind of worldview when I myself was 9 years old. But then again, I'm not a witch either."

Few things sadden me more than Discworld fans who won't read these books because they're ""for children"". They're missing out on so much! I find the Tiffany stories darker, more moving and even more funny than the majority of the adult books in the series. Really can't express my love for them enough!"

I read it after he died and I felt it was a nicely sentimental goodbye to as many characters as he could and the world that he created.   I took this quote from Vetinari right at the end as him saying 'it's up to you lot now to keep creating'.   “The world is changing and it needs its shepherds and sometimes its butchers. And in this case, I’m its shepherd. Your enterprise has been noted. And all that anyone can say now is: What next?

discworld,36pyyn,beardslap,6,Thu May 21 04:48:57 2015 UTC,Is this not a bit cart before the horse? Surely he will learn about subverting fantasy tropes through reading Discworld books.  I started reading about the same age (11/12) and what I got was the books were just worlds apart from what I was reading at that time. I missed a lot of the references first time around but not knowing it was a pastiche of Macbeth did not lessen my enjoyment of Wyrd Sisters.  (It's a great idea to get him hooked though. Top work!)
discworld,36pyyn,pratchettjob,3,Thu May 21 08:26:56 2015 UTC,"Hmm, good point, I loved the books from that age too, despite not understanding most of the references. I'd read The Hobbit and I'd had Lord of the Rings read to me but that was about the only adult fantasy I knew. When I was a bit older I started re-reading the books and looking up what they were parodying/referencing - but I think they're still great, fun stories even if you're not familiar with any of that stuff."

Its construction started in 1357 under the auspices of King Charles IV, and finished in the beginning of the 15th century.  The bridge replaced the old Judith Bridge built 1158–1172 that had been badly damaged by a flood in 1342. This new bridge was originally called the Stone Bridge (Kamenný most) or the Prague Bridge (Pražský most) but has been the ""Charles Bridge"" since 1870.  As the only means of crossing the river Vltava (Moldau) until 1841, the Charles Bridge was the most important connection between Prague Castle and the city's Old Town and adjacent areas. This ""solid-land"" connection made Prague important as a trade route between Eastern and Western Europe.     Interesting: Old St. Charles Bridge | Charles River Bridge v.

discworld,36ejup,Gambit791,3,Tue May 19 11:44:01 2015 UTC,"I wrote a blog thing for my work about what I wanted my little sister to get out of each of the Tiffany Aching books. I was forced to be concise which I think I was, but badly. There was so much I didn't get to say about each of the books. Quite a lot of what you've said for starters!   I especially loved I Shall Wear Midnight.   I think it's one of my favourite books ever hands down. It's so dark for a YA novel but contains so much hope and light. In the first couple of chapters a 13 year old pregnant girl is beaten up so badly by her father she miscarries, and our 16 year old protagonist has to stop the father from being murdered by misguided righteousness of the villagers. And even though you know he deserves it, you are in Tiffany's head and thinking her thoughts and so you also know letting him die is not the right thing to do, for him or for them. And in the end, the mum still stays with the dad and through Tiffany's eyes I could see that while that definitely wasn't right for me, it was right for them.   I think you're right. There is so much darkness in the book - so much evil, pure stupid pitch black evil and it's scary because even though you'd like to think otherwise there is nothing inhuman or supernatural about the evil - the evil is literally us. It's in us all. BUT so is the good. There is equally nothing supernatural about what defeats the evil, we all have that magic in us right now.    How often do you hear the Rough Music on reddit, or anywhere? How often do we see the cunning man? Our reality does not have a Tiffany Aching to swoop down and save us. It's up to us to be Tiffany, and that scares the hell out of me but it also gives me hope and makes me feel like I have a bit of control about how much evil is in our world."

discworld,369jp0,Nieros,2,Sun May 17 16:01:49 2015 UTC,"Damn, I'm so thinking about getting the whole set as well. Actually, i'm just a click away from buying them, but I don't know if I should get them or the corgi paperback set of all 40 novels. If they were sewn, then it would be a no-brainer, but I'm afraid of them falling apart after not much use (knowing me and my reading habits).

I've always assumed this was due to some international trade/publishing stupidity, but the more I see, even in the UK it seems hard to get a quality set of Discworld books. What the heck, publishers?! Do they not want our money, either dollars, pounds,  or euros?"
discworld,369jp0,JimGuthrie,3,Sun May 17 20:07:39 2015 UTC,"Part of it is a rights split with the books.  gollancz only owns the first 20 some books,  trans world owns the rest.   Short of getting original hardcovers though...  I haven't seen many sewn bindings."
discworld,369jp0,JimGuthrie,2,Sun May 17 22:47:07 2015 UTC,Are the originals sewn?
discworld,369jp0,RevoltOfTheBeavers,2,Mon May 18 15:39:56 2015 UTC,"Until semi-recently  most hardbacks were   ""casebound"".  Which means they had complete signatures,  were sometimes sewn  and then glued into the cover.  I'd say the 80s and 90s  hardbacks were typically done this way.  Much more recently  ""perfect bound""  has permeated even hardcover bindings.   This is the common binding paperbacks, all even cut and glued right in.  in my experience,  I typically prefer a binding with signatures over one without.   I'm just a bibliophile though - the guys over at /r/bookbinding  could explain it better than me.."

But I'm also thinking it wouldn't be a bad idea if they tested the waters for this idea through digital releases. I'm sure it wouldn't be very expensive for them to get them together, slap a new cover on them and release them."

The trouble is that those were made back when there were only about 3 books in each series, and the books were huge hardbacks even then! So they'd have to do several books for each now.  I imagine it would depend on the success of those original collected editions as well. If they didn't sell very well then that could be another reason why they don't make them any more."

discworld,361nab,William_de_Worde,3,Sun May 17 06:32:09 2015 UTC,Night Watch is devoid of easy answers. What is law? Who should enforce it? Who should dictate it?   Best example of this is when Vimes learns Winder is dead and invites the soldiers to defend the barricade while his group attacks -- because now everything is reversed.  I really loved that moment.
discworld,361nab,TheBrownWelsh,2,Fri May 15 19:00:32 2015 UTC,"This was the book that convinced me that I was wrong not to read the series in publication order. I was a bit intimidated by the sheer length of the series, so I took a book here and there (one of the first being The Truth, hence the username). I didn't enjoy Night Watch as much as I should have, because I knew that there were dozens of references only a seasoned Morporkian would understand.   I have just finished Witches Abroad, following the publication order - I can't wait to get back to Night Watch in a year or two and enjoy it as it was meant to be enjoyed."
discworld,361nab,roobens,2,Fri May 15 13:45:01 2015 UTC,"And this is exactly why I'm still reading in publication order like I always have. Its akin to bingeing on an old show you love; the anticipation of what's to come is so exciting. I can't wait to get to Night Watch again, it's my favourite bar none."
discworld,361nab,William_de_Worde,1 point,Fri May 15 16:24:53 2015 UTC,"I find it odd when people recommend not reading in publication order because the earlier books are written in a different vein and style to the later ones. Yes they are, but they're also still recognisably discworld books, and offer a great grounding in all aspects of the disc. I also think it's odd to be intimidated by the amount of books (no offence), given that each one stands alone, even the later ones, although you obviously get more out of them if you know the background and the characters. It's not so much of a series as a bunch of standalone stories set within the same world, that become more interconnected and have more recurring character as time goes on. Plus they're just so damn easy to read."
discworld,361nab,morfeuszj,2,Fri May 15 18:20:58 2015 UTC,"I think it was a combination of 1) the general belief I observed that the earlier books were lacking the quality of the later books (which, having now started to read them in publication order, I don't agree with) and 2) that many books could be read as standalone stories.   But yes, now I realise that it was a bad way to start and wouldn't recommend anything other than publication order to people. Thankfully I have a terrible memory so by the time I get around to Night Watch I'm sure it'll be like reading it for the first time!"

Specifically since the auditors caused the storm to show up out of nowhere in Thief, while the storm that hits the university had been coming in all day. Colon mentions as such ""I recon we're in for thunderstorms."" to Vimes that morning.  Not to mention that the lightning hit the university, not the workshop's rod."
discworld,361nab,-packrat,2,Tue May 19 05:23:22 2015 UTC,"Just after this book came out, PTerry did a signing tour of the UK, and he stopped at the Waterstones in my home town. To this day, I kick myself for not going in after college that day.  This is the book that got my brother into reading for pleasure. Shortly after we'd both read it, he discovered the Stephen Briggs audio book version and began absorbing as many of the Discworld novels available as read by Briggsy.  Night Watch is my all time favourite Discworld novel, closely (very, very closely) followed by Reaper Man. It's such an amazing story, with such great insight into how revolutions are borne and what is possible when a person is pushed to their very limit.  My favourite quote has to be one of Vimes' final lines:   No. How dare you? How dare you! At this time! In this place! They did the job they didn't have to do, and they died doing it, and you can't give them anything. Do you understand? They fought for those who'd been abandoned, they fought for one another, and they were betrayed. Men like them always are. What good would a statue be? It'd just inspire new fools to believe they're going to be heroes. They wouldn't want that. Just let them be. For ever."
discworld,361nab,DavidJMichaels,2,Sun May 17 09:02:53 2015 UTC,"Because I bought it from the WH Smith booth at DWCon 04, where Sir PTerry spent extra time with me.  Because of its treatment of war, violence, and the rational man's reaction to it.  Note Vimes, consciously holding his pose for the people in the doorway, sipping cocoa, holding his cigar, so all can see the hate unrequited.  Note him confronting the torturer, his fury unleashed after seeing the victims: ""And what does daddy do at work all day?""  Note the hopeful glances passed between older and younger military men, Perhaps It Will Be A Quiet Night--Until Carcer, the type of maniac that finds promotions in such places, comes in to kick the honeybucket over.  Note how Vimes reliving his past as a much more mature man, and able to guide his younger self, can have second and third thought observations about all of the human condition.  And (tears in my eyes now) how Vimes knows that he cannot go and see his mum, alive in this time period, but to him long buried in Small Gods.  Some things are not meant to be, even with a time machine."

Covers are a primer for readers and they nudge the reader in a direction even berfore they open the book, but for writers I bet they are a huge missrepresentation of what they pictured in their heads.

discworld,36228w,HarlequinValentine,3,Fri May 15 15:34:23 2015 UTC,"Hmm, well if we were only talking about Josh Kirby's art, then that could be a possibility, since he interpreted things very much ""his way"". But it's been portrayed that way by pretty much every artist since, including in the Colour of Magic film.

discworld,35u4rp,CookieClown,6,Wed May 13 15:06:34 2015 UTC,"I have not played Clacks, so this is not a review.  But I did play one of the design team's previous games, Guards, Guards.  A number of people on boardgamegeek.com (a popular boardgame site) saw the preview rulebook and components and had reservations: it has Discworld names but doesn't feel like Ankh-Morpork; the gameplay appears repetitive, long, and somewhat random.  The designers assured us that the game was thoroughly playtested for years and we would see that our concerns were not true.  When I finally got the chance to play the game, I found that my concerns were true.  The most likely explanation is that the designers belong to a regular gaming group and made a game that their group loves.  This often promotes groupthink and results in games that have been played a lot by the designers' friends but playtested very little.  For example, blind playtesting might have given them feedback like, ""the rulebook is confusing"" or ""the game is too long/boring,"" which was the common response after the game was published.  They later released a 2nd edition with an improved rulebook.  The designers are Discworld fans, so they themed them game with Discworld characters.  However, it does not feel like they took the Discworld books, found game mechanisms inspired by the books, and made a game from it.  Rather, they took the sort of game they like to play and gave it a Discworld theme.  It's a subtle difference, but it's there.  I am sure the designers create games that they love.  They spent years and years working on Guards, Guards and were proud to show a prototype to Pratchett at a convention, and he approved of them going ahead with publishing the game.  The question is whether it's a game you'll like and want in your home and associated with the Discworld you love.  As a long-time boardgamer, I highly recommend playing a game and/or reading reviews before buying a game, not just purchasing it based on the theme.  FYI, Martin Wallace has designed two games, Discworld: Ankh-Morpork and The Witches: A Discworld Game.  The former was generally well-received  (it's light and also a little loose with themeing), the latter less so."
discworld,35u4rp,jgf1123,3,Wed May 13 21:20:36 2015 UTC,"I have all three, and Discworld: Ankh-Morpork and The Witches: A Discworld Game are far better than Guards! Guards! (we have the 2nd edition too, the rules are STILL confusing)   My wife and I have not ever managed to even finish a game of Guards! Guards! yet, (the time on the side of the box is a LIE!) I think it would probably be better with the full compliment of players.   We proper enjoy the other two though. Not sure why everyone was so down on the witches game, it's a fun fast game, and the art on the board and the pewter pieces are amazing (did buy the collectors edition tho)  So far the Ankh one is our favorite, so we have high hopes for this one :D"
discworld,35u4rp,wankshaft,2,Thu May 14 00:14:06 2015 UTC,"Do not play Guards! Guards! with a full compliment.  Yes, you get a more interesting player dynamic because now you can form alliances and wheel-and-deal and develop rivalries and get revenge.  But going from 2 to 6 players will also increase game time by a factor of 3.  We did the stupid thing of starting a game at 9-ish with no one having played before or read the rules.  By 3 or 4am, the owner had stopped her rivalry with her boyfriend and was aiding his victory so we could get to sleep.  Do 3 or 4 players.  That should be enough to get the multiplayer dynamic while avoiding the length of a full game.  But there are much faster Take That games.  I liked Ankh-Morpork.  It's light, but fun and usually pretty tight right up to the end.  By the time I got Witches, I had moved and didn't have a regular game group, so I've only played it solo.  I think my main quibble is that often it seems the best move is obvious, so you just do that?"

I bought it at Penny Arcade Expo, played it in the Sheraton Lobby with friends and randoms, it took over 3 hours (thankfully we had pizza delivered by the Gearbox team for absolutely no good reason) and the only fun we had was mocking the rules.  If you're a Discworld fan you'll get some enjoyment out of examining the board and tokens and cards, but there is really no reason to waste time actually playing the game (Guards! Guards!).

discworld,35u4rp,captainkirkthejerk,2,Wed May 13 22:32:56 2015 UTC,"For example: Chutes and Ladders.  The game is random in that you make progress or go backwards the whims of the dice and the board layout, not through your skill.  The game is repetitive in that the only thing you do is roll dice until someone finally reaches the end.  Your hope is that the game ends before tedium sinks in.  Guards, Guards is repetitive in that, to win, you have to build up sufficient amounts a particular stat and try to make a roll.  Then do that 5 or 6 times during the game to win.  The game doesn't really evolve, you just keep doing the same thing.  The game is random because it's fairly dependent on what you roll and what cards you draw, which is annoying when you're hunting for a particular stat.  Also, there can be large swings of fate depending on what happens to you or what other players do to you, which hinders long-term planning."

Like, sort of, it had more people in it and more of the city, if you follow me. Then, correct me if I'm wrong, sarge, but that'd mean in a manner of speaking we are now in front of the barricades, am I right? Then, as it were, it's not like we're rebellin', is it? 'cos there's more of us, so the majority can't rebel, it stands to reason. So that makes us the good guys. Obviously we've been the good guys all along, but now it'd be kind of official, right?

So I'm able to whip through them a lot faster than her because she prefers the paperback versions and can't carry her book everywhere she goes.  TL;DR - She's into it and she's an awesome partner :)"

When I was into reading the HP books I read the 6th book (which I randomly got at a midnight book store opening when it was released - totally unplanned I might add) that night - then slept.  I eat books :D

discworld,35plzk,madmoneymcgee,15,Tue May 12 22:45:50 2015 UTC,The best part about Pratchett's politics in his writing is that he manages to be optimistic without being idealistic. There is a real faith that pragmatism can acheive the best results even if things don't end up being perfect.
discworld,35plzk,TopRamen713,13,Tue May 12 18:10:56 2015 UTC,I just reread this book after Baltimore and because it's May. It's so poignant. The video of the looter getting yelled at by his mother reminds me of putting grannies on the barricades.

discworld,35ir2g,Jammintk,3,Sun May 10 23:16:54 2015 UTC,"For those unsure what OCR means:  OCR stands for Optical Character Recognition.  It's a technique whereby you can scan a page of text into a computer (all scans go in as images) and the computer converts it into a page of text. An entire book can be scanned, page by page, and a text file can be created containing the entire book. Most of the time this is done because the original manuscript is missing or it is deemed ""faster"" than typing the manuscript.  /u/Hopwood is complaining at the quality of the OCR (and subsequent editing) used by HarperCollins. Presumably the OCR software they have used is terrible and has made several errors in recognising certain words or punctuation marks, swapping them out for incorrect ones, presumably."

discworld,359y78,pratchettjob,85,Fri May 8 10:05:30 2015 UTC,"From an interview in 2008:   ""My advice is this. For Christ's sake, don't write a book that is suitable for a kid of 12 years old, because the kids who read who are 12 years old are reading books for adults. I read all of the James Bond books when I was about 11, which was approximately the right time to read James Bond books. So you work out this kind of little equation in your head and you think, yeah, like Nation – the one that's just come out – that's a book for kids. And people will say: 'Well it covers very adult subjects ...' Yeah, that's why it's a book for kids. Because you want kids to grow up to be adults, not just bigger kids."""
discworld,359y78,SirJefferE,3,Fri May 8 12:15:41 2015 UTC,"Because you want kids to grow up to be adults, not just bigger kids.   Yep.  That's why I bought my niece the first three Tiffany Aching books."
discworld,359y78,jgf1123,29,Fri May 8 17:33:39 2015 UTC,"Because Pratchett never believed in lying to children. He hated that children's fiction had become completely sanitised, and he mentions that repeatedly in his Death arc, and especially in Hogfather. He hated that children were protected from everything, to the point that they were no longer able to understand the darker side of things."
discworld,359y78,TranshumansFTW,3,Fri May 8 11:59:26 2015 UTC,The Science books cover a lot of lies to children though.
discworld,359y78,Stellar_Duck,7,Fri May 8 19:21:36 2015 UTC,"In the context of those books, it was more of a ""here's the little lie we have to tell you so you can eventually understand the truth""."

discworld,359y78,EmporerNorton,14,Fri May 8 14:47:14 2015 UTC,He also has things aimed at 'wee bairns' but the YA stuff is complex because he doesn't pander to kids. Like many of Roald Dahl's books they may have been aimed at teens but he knew teens are better readers and more complex people than many adults give them credit for. It's like we turn 30 and forget we weren't total idiots at 14.
discworld,359y78,madmoneymcgee,6,Fri May 8 11:47:57 2015 UTC,I was at least 95% idiot back then but some of the non-idiot was definitely my ability to read heavy stuff (though I might have failed to appreciate it at the time as I've since found).
discworld,359y78,MsAlign,8,Fri May 8 14:23:17 2015 UTC,"Huh.  Coincidentally I'm reading it right now for the first time.  It seems pretty on par with his other YA fiction.  Less grim than Nation, that's for sure."
discworld,359y78,WomanWhoWeaves,5,Fri May 8 12:14:27 2015 UTC,Nation was dark.  I really liked Maurice.
discworld,359y78,madmoneymcgee,8,Fri May 8 14:07:25 2015 UTC,First I'll just say that is the best cover for this book I've seen. The American ones are all pretty boring.   But I love his books that are ostensibly for kids because he doesn't make it that easy for them. Sure its nice to have chapter divisions but other than that there isn't much difference.
discworld,359y78,HarlequinValentine,7,Fri May 8 14:21:48 2015 UTC,"I'd personally file Amazing Maurice under Middle Grade (9-12), the genre I write for, along with the first few Tiffany books. Whereas I'd put I Shall Wear Midnight, Nation and probably Dodger under YA. All of them have crossover appeal, though, it's just that the latter ones have older characters and darker themes.  I think it's a bit of misconception that children's literature isn't dark these days. For a very recent example, I just picked up The Dreamsnatcher, which begins with an old lady having her fingers burned off in a fire. There's plenty of darkness in kids' books if you know where to look!"

discworld,35aow9,mattwandcow,13,Fri May 8 15:05:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and in Soul Music we see that Susan was hiding and watching the fight. Death knew she was there and didn't want to kill her father in front of her. Or.... In fact.... Ensure she never existed. But whether it not Pratchett had something like that in mind when he wrote Mort, I don't know. If so, that's some serious storyline planning!"

discworld,35aow9,Riddla26,12,Fri May 8 19:29:57 2015 UTC,"Death realized that Mort and Ysabell were the closest to family he would likely ever have. Some other stuff is revealed in Soul Music, but mostly, it was that Mort truly understood Death and why he was so lonely because of how close to Death he had become (until the Rite of AshkEnte anyway.)   When Death fought Mort, the Duke's lifetimer was broken. Death notices this, even though Mort and Ysabell don't. I think that's when Death starts to get an idea of how to fix everything. Until then, he hadn't really been thinking of Mort and Ysabell in terms of family. After this, as Ysabell is pleading with him and Mort is fighting to stay alive, Death realizes that Mort and Ysabell deserve to live. He also, for the first time, agrees with Mort that justice needs to be done sometimes, and that, while Justice doesn't come into the regular work of Death, he has the opportunity to cause a Just outcome because they are in His land."
discworld,35aow9,Jammintk,3,Fri May 8 18:12:36 2015 UTC,"I always thought that Mort at that point actually WAS death. He had the voice and the look.

The reason I thought he let him go was the last thing they'd said: YOU DON'T KNOW HOW SORRY THIS MAKES ME.

discworld,359tbt,G3Di,4,Fri May 8 14:42:30 2015 UTC,"I generally recommend Monstrous Regiment. Stands alone, some great humour and a bit of social commentary with the bonus of having a few cameos from other Discworld series scattered about."
discworld,359tbt,AlwaysSayHi,3,Fri May 8 15:51:13 2015 UTC,"No idea why you'd get downvoted for this (then again, it's my favorite TP novel, other than maybe Nation). But Regiment definitely seems under-loved on Reddit. That said, couldn't agree more.  I've been reading all the Discworld books aloud to my son, and Monstrous Regiment is the only one so far that he's asked me to begin re-reading immediately as soon as we finished it. Your mileage may vary, as they say :D"

discworld,359tbt,wear_my_socks,6,Tue May 12 20:18:52 2015 UTC,"Really difficult question to answer properly. A lot of it comes down to the personality of the reader in my opinion. The groups of characters that feature heavily in different books (The Watch, the University, the Witches, Death etc.) strike different notes with different people.   Also, certain books deal well with certain topics. Jingo is a great read for how silly it paints wars to be. Slavery and the psychology behind being a slave features heavily in Feet of Clay. Small Gods is a great read for how it deals with human beliefs. And computing makes an appearance in Going Postal.  Personally I love Commander Vimes and would choose a Watch-centric book."

discworld,353r5e,juliet_echo_alpha,3,Wed May 6 23:51:03 2015 UTC,I noticed this on my latest re-read of ToT. It's so satisfying to imagine that they're the same character that I wonder if it wasn't intentional.
discworld,353r5e,thesuperevilclown,8,Thu May 7 00:33:19 2015 UTC,"the entire time-travelling section of Night Watch (in other words, 9/10ths of the story) happen during the instant that the lightning strikes the glass clock in Thief of Time (in other words, about half of THAT story) because when the passage of time gets broken and fragmented to that extent, sticking it all back together can take a while. the fact that Vimes, Carcer and Vimes' armor end up in different places throughout Ankh-Morpork are evidence that Lobsang changed things a bit when he did the fixup job."
discworld,353r5e,PinkyPankyPonky,2,Thu May 7 03:52:42 2015 UTC,"I think that second part is important to mention, but you're the only one that has. It is more a side effect of the History Monks interference in rectifying the damage caused by the events of ToT than the storm itself. Had the clock not been made, and the monks not been trying to patch things up then it would have just been a normal storm going overhead and nothing would have happened when it struck."

After all, Vimes spends a lot of his night shifts (before Sybil) not eating, drinking heavily and staying away for days on end. That kind of lifestyle mixed with constantly being (metaphorically) kicking in the wasnames tends to make folks thinner and more disheveled (I find).  Colon is a jolly (read: fat) man because he's (very) well looked after by his wife and really likes his food.  Nobby, on the other hand, is thin and wiry because he has no wife or girlfriend (except for Tawney and the girl who hits him with fish [can't remember her name]). Having been a street urchin, he'll be used to not eating a lot so he won't.  Carrot is a dwarf (technically human) and was raised as one. So he will be used to eating dwarven bread and the like. Stodgy, solid food that puts hairs in your beard. Plus he's a hard working country boy, so he'll have the body to take extra calories when he gets given them.

discworld,34xfiv,pratchettjob,12,Tue May 5 10:53:42 2015 UTC,"IMHO, people obsess way too much over reading order. Everyone knows at this point that the earliest works aren't the best but they're still damn good. If you're genuinely put off by TCOM, then skip ahead to Small Gods and give up if you're still not engaged. Otherwise, just read through them chronologically. Important concepts are introduced in earlier books that help set the groundwork for later ones.  edit: Just to confirm, I went back to read TCOM and my first genuine chuckle occurred on the 3rd page:   By now the whole of downtown Ankh-Morpork was alight, and the richer and worthier citizens of Ankh on the far bank were bravely responding to the situation by feverishly demolishing the bridges.    That's a line that would fit completely naturally in any of the later books and proves Pratchett had that spark of wit from the very beginning."

Start at the beginning, just like he did. That's why. Some people are just arrogant twats. I'm dealing with someone in another fandom with similar hangups and it's frustrating. Not everyone likes the same stuff. These people need to just sit back and let other people do their own thing.  Seriously - it's exciting to watch the writing style evolve. I'm about 1/4 into Pyramids (Bk 7), having started at the first novel and worked my way through. So far I've only really disliked one book (Sourcery, Bk 5) but found each to be better than the last. I'm almost all a tingle at the fact that the next book I will read will be ""Guards! Guards!"" - a book that gets quite a bit of hype online - but I'm enjoying the journey."

I am now giddy like a schoolgirl every month I get a new credit and can once again delve into the discworld series.  I'm told I am missing a lot of the visual jokes on page by not reading the books, but I know I will listen to absolutely every book because of Sam vimes and his merry band of misfits"
discworld,34xfiv,Merxermike,1 point,Wed May 6 12:28:24 2015 UTC,"That's awesome. I've only just started using my Audible account with Pyramids - for $2 and some change I could add the unabridged narrated version of the book to my Kindle account, and it has 'Whispersync' - the audio would pick up where I left off in the text (and vice versa). I'm enjoying this new-to-me format. I've tried audio books in the past and had unfavorable experiences. I still have the occasional problem where I fall asleep listening to the story and miss about 15-20 minutes worth before I wake back up and stop the playback, but I'm not having any problems following the tale.  I think other audio books I've tried before had too much production going on - sound effects, multiple voice actors like a radio play, voice effects and whatnot, overall distracting me from the story.  Nigel Planer does an awesome job with his narration. I was glad to see he reads over half of the books."
discworld,34xfiv,Arch27,3,Wed May 6 12:48:20 2015 UTC,"""The colour of magic"" and the follow-up ""The light fantastic"" are in my opinion two of the top three Discworld novels, the other one being ""Eric"". ""Equal rights"",""Mort"", ""Small Gods"" are also good. After that his novels start to repeat and become too formulaic. I read ""Unseen academicals"" like few days ago, and it was a choir to read it. It felt so predictable and obvious. Terry P. really loved his world, but unfortunately he loved the established pattern of his novels way too much. The pattern being this:  1 - Something mysterious happens in the beginning signaling the beginning of a ""storm of events""  2 - The main character is introduced, doing ordinary stuff, not being a hero at all, yet he is SPECIAL in some way, he's a dreamer or a visionary  3 - Various sidekicks are introduced, all being normal people but firmly rooted to the ground and possessing the wisdom of everyday experience  4 - Shit slowly starts to hit the fan, all the characters are pushed together by the forces of fate  5 - Shit really explodes and now somebody has to fix it  6 - At this point the main character has come to terms with his uniqueness and found his inner strength and abilities, which he uses to defeat the main antagonist/fix the threat/situation  7 - Finale and reconciliation"

They were not in any way a group of super heroes or good at all.  Vetinari was most definitely not part of them nor was any of the current watch.  They were basically cronies of Lord Windsor.

discworld,34t4yu,Thelonous,2,Mon May 4 18:46:40 2015 UTC,"You are correct they are not the same, and it seems a bit odd that Vimes would revive the name of the despised Cable Street Particulars when he decided he needed a plainclothes division.  Though I can justify that in my mind because Vimes clearly mistrusted the idea of plainclothes cops, and may well have chosen that name so as to make sure he did not become too comfortable with the concept.  I do not recall Nightwatch explicitly explaining the origin of the name ""Unmentionables.""  It is possible you are right and the name refers to the citizens' fear of even speaking about the secret police.  It is ALSO possible that name refers to the fact they are secret."

discworld,34t47o,mustardsteve,2,Thu May 7 03:02:27 2015 UTC,"The witches transform him on purpose in Witches Abroad, and he later learns to repeat the trick on his own in Maskerade.  You can read more about it on the Discworld wiki."
discworld,34t47o,autowikiabot,1 point,Thu May 7 08:06:30 2015 UTC,"Greebo (from Discworld wikia):       Greebo is a fictional character in Terry Pratchett's Discworld books. He is first introduced in Wyrd Sisters. He is a foul-tempered one-eyed grey tomcat whose human, Nanny Ogg, insists against all the evidence that he is a sweet, harmless kitten. In the course of the books, he has killed two vampires, eating at least one of them in the novel Witches Abroad:   The bat squirmed under his claw. It seemed to Greebo's small cat brain that it was trying to change its shape, and he wasn't having any of that from a mouse with wings on. In * Lords and Ladies, Greebo's overall attitude is best described in an allusion to Schrödinger's cat: Greebo had spent an irritating two minutes in that box. Technically, a cat locked in a box may be alive or it may be dead. You never know until you look. In fact, the mere act of opening the box will determine the state of the cat, although in this case there were three determinate states the cat could be in: these being Alive, Dead, and Bloody Furious. Shawn dived sideways as Greebo went off like a Claymore mine. ""Don't worry about him,"" said Magrat dreamily, as the elf flailed at the maddened cat. ""He's just a big softy."" In *Witches Abroad he was transformed, for reasons that seemed to be a good idea at the time, into a human. He was confused by the differences between human and cat morphology and social relationships, but picked some aspects up quickly. In this incarnation, the character is reminiscent of Red Dwarf's Cat; he looks like a 'beautiful, brainless bully' who has raided a leather goods store for the discerning pirate, and appears ready to unbuckle any amount of swash, radiating an aura of raw sex that can be felt several rooms away, and of a Megawatt magnitude. He is typically covered in scars, has retractable nails (or more accurately, claws) and maintains a slitted left eye. The incident left him with an unstable phenotype, that is, a tendency to temporarily switch forms when completely cornered, which causes some excitement. In Maskerade he once more took longer-term human shape, attending the Ankh-Morpork Opera in the guise of the Count Gribeau. In a passing reference in Witches Abroad Nanny Ogg said that Greebo was a demon (""Just between you and me, he's a fiend from hell""), possibly indicating that Greebo is indeed demonic, partially due to Nanny's insistence otherwise that Greebo is a gentle kitten. In addition to his other qualities, he is pursuing a study in inbreeding with all of the other cats in Lancre that are related to him (which by dint of some effort is all of them, as he is currently every male ancestor for at least 30 generation), which may be involved in the ""raw sex"" aura he possesses mentioned above. He has also seriously surprised a she-bear (also killed and eaten half of one before) and chased a female wolf up a tree. To date, Greebo is known to fear only three things: * the Nac Mac Feegle * the black cockerel Legba, who belongs to the voodoo 'witch' Mrs Gogol * 'You', a small white kitten owned by Granny Weatherwax. Their first encounter ended with You burying her claws in Greebo's face and his subsequent retreat. He now hides behind the pots and pans whenever she is in the same house as him. * the black cockerel Legba, who belongs to the voodoo 'witch' Mrs Gogol * 'You', a small white kitten owned by Granny Weatherwax. Their first encounter ended with You burying her claws in Greebo's face and his subsequent retreat. He now hides behind the pots and pans whenever she is in the same house as him. In Terry Pratchett's Johnny Maxwell series, Mrs. Tachyon owns a cat named Guilty who has many qualities similar to Greebo.

I find Kirby's covers to be very nice as independent art to examine, they're extremely busy and interesting to look over in detail and extremely identifiable. But as representative of the Discworld tone and content, just dreadful in my opinion, even having the strong association I do. Everything about them is a juxtaposition of Pratchett's style, except possibly in the earliest days.  Edit: In for a penny, in for a pound: I've not seen any cover which captures the Discworld for me, but that's down to my imagination probably. Kidby comes closest."

To my knowledge, the only way you can get a pretty much full set of covers at the moment is the black minimalist paperbacks, because these Gollancz hardbacks stop at Jingo."

And when I stumbled on the first Tiffany book I did not understand most of what they were saying at all. But I continued and by the second book I realized that I suddenly do. It's just takes some time to get use to it, to recognize some of the core phrases and words and you will be good to go. I strongly suggest to use the books, you can find them on the bay-that-shall-not-be-named and try them a bit, when you see that I was right you can bye them officially and everything is good :)"

I'd even probably forget to list it amongst my own Discworld favourites because it's a different style of book to the others. But it's absolutely brilliant.  Paul Kidby's illustrations are just fantastic as well. He's my favourite artist. I hope he'll continue to do Discworld art, and I'm really looking forward to seeing the cover for the final book.  I once had Hogswatch dinner with the guy that Paul Kidby apparently based the appearance of Cohen on. What a legend! He really looks the part!"
discworld,34i31h,07hogada,3,Fri May 1 18:29:56 2015 UTC,"The Last Hero holds a special place in my heart, being the first Discworld I read, when I was like 9-10? My mum had the big hardback one, so the cover got me interested, 'cause who doesn't think Cohen looks a complete BAMF? So anyways, cover got me interested, and then I started reading, and lost myself in this world of gods, wooden spaceships and turtles, turtles all the way down. I think I read the entirety of the published series within about three or four months after that, and have reread most of them several times since. Still in my top ten of DW, and is probably the book I'd recommend a younger reader/someone who doesn't enjoy reading as much, to start the series on, due to the fantastic illustrations by Paul Kidby."

discworld,33p2wf,OriginalStomper,10,Fri Apr 24 10:04:01 2015 UTC,"A tough choice, but probably Going Postal. The plot is well-structured and narratively satisfying, the characters are great (Adora Belle and Gilt are among my all-time favourite Discworld characters, along with Moist himself, not to forget the minor characters like Horsefry, Gryle, Mr Pump, and Groat), the humour is brilliant, and it breaks a lot of new ground, not just thematically but also in terms of the asides and parodies (and when it does retread old ground - the parodying of secret societies is very reminiscent of Guards! Guards! - it does so in a hilarious way).  The standout scene is definitely when Moist is baiting Gilt as a part of the bet to see who can get a message to a different part of the Disc as quickly as possible.  It may not be as deep as some of Pratchett's other novels, but in every other respect it's firing on all cylinders."

discworld,33p2wf,DavidJMichaels,3,Fri Apr 24 23:28:50 2015 UTC,"Man, I can't believe I missed the Matrix references, I must have seen that film thirty times when I was younger.  I did like Thief of Time, but for me it doesn't quite match Pratchett's finest work. Susan is great but I prefer Granny Weatherwax for all of the difficulties-of-being-magic stuff. There are a few versions of Jeremy throughout the series, so he doesn't feel very original either. The Auditors are good villains and the scenes where they try to adjust to being human are fun, but I was disappointed that their leader (Mr White?) turns into a standard maniac. The Ronnie Soak thing was funny but might have been better as a minor joke or even a footnote.  All that said, it's a great book and it tackles its themes in an interesting and thought-provoking way."
discworld,33p2wf,ResistReact,6,Fri Apr 24 12:21:45 2015 UTC,"Boy that's hard to read. I understand your misgivings, but disagree with you on every point. I can't think of another Jeremy-like character, I thought the auditors devolving in to violence was a great commentary on humanities darker urges especially their discovery of edged weapons, and I loved kaos and I wish he had more appearances (along with war and the other horsemen).   But I suppose that's what's great about terry, he's done so much so well that there is no definitive ""best discworld book"" and people all have their own perfectly valid opinions."

discworld,33p2wf,kataskopo,2,Mon Apr 27 03:29:59 2015 UTC,"I think Thief of Time will always be my favorite Discworld novel. Of course, part of the problem is that so many of them are so great, and the question of favorites arises from time to time, so one must simply pick one, because people don't like the answer as ""well, most of them, actually"".  On the other hand, it's also, I think, legitimately my favorite.  I don't want to spoil any of the surprise… but there really is much to like, all around, with every story and sub-story. It is a masterpiece.  One thing that confuses me, though, is that I don't think Igor is undead. There are undead in the novels, and they are clearly so. Igors are good at surgery and graft parts of people onto people, something that works better in Discworld than here (with body parts being rejected by the recipient's bodies in many cases). So Igors are good at medical things, and mad science; but not undead, I didn't think. In fact, I think it might be argued that Igors are.... remarkably alive. lol"
discworld,33p2wf,FrisianDude,5,Fri Apr 24 12:37:00 2015 UTC,The water and jug thing was actually a Bruce Lee quote about how/why he fought without a specific style. Applied here to how beings wrapped in human form all become human-ish. Perfect for a kung-fu book. https://youtu.be/pAxOHPmITHI

And it's not about the budget or the special effects, what I find the most lacking is just basic cinematography.  I tried watching Hogsfather but most scenes lacked tension and excitement, like the part where Death comes to talk to Susan, in the books it made it seem like she was fed up about it all, but in the movies they just have a casual conversation without intonation or emphasis.  Or the part where the Tooth Fairy coachman is killed, there was no emphasis like in the books, it just kinda happened and that's it.  Then the Auditors arrive instantly, talk with that raspy, whiny voice, say that death is coming and go away, and instantly there appears Death, instead of letting the scene hang a little bit with quiet time.  /rant."

I never had anyone to talk with about them. When I was a kid, my local bookshop would keep a copy of any new Discworld book behind the counter for me as they would only ever see me when a new one was released. They used to joke that I was the only one person in town who would buy them, the rest were all tourists! Even though I knew they were messing with me, there were times where I thought I was the only kid in my school, town or even county who actually did like them. They were my escape.  Since Sir Terry's death, I've only now started to appreciate just how many people were actually just like me; artists, bloggers, game developers, web designers and programmers all taking the time to pay their respects through their work and hobbies. His book sales figures were incredible but hard to get a grasp or a connection for the people behind them - it's one thing selling someone a book but to make those people want to share their admiration of what Terry gave them with the world simply blows me away.  It warms my heart every time I see a Clacks Overhead, or something like this, especially in places I don't expect to see them. I don't feel as alone as I used to.

For example the game of Thud is actually introduced in an earlier book but it doesn't really matter.

discworld,33f25b,travelinghobbit,3,Wed Apr 22 16:06:07 2015 UTC,"From the beginning of Wit and Wisdom of Discworld:    One of the big questions about Discworld for a newcomer is ‘Where do I start?’ This is a tricky one. For every diehard fan of Rincewind there’s an advocate for Small Gods. For everyone who loves the ‘Witch’ or ‘City Watch’ books, there is another who prefers the ‘one theme’ books, such as Soul Music and Moving Pictures. I, as it happens, kicked off with Mort.   Many people have varying views on the best reading order for the series but they generally follow a couple of guidelines:   The first two books in the series, The Colour of Magic and The Light Fantastic are generally regarded as the worst Discworld books. This is not to say that they are bad books, but rather that Sir Terry needed some time to properly figure out what he wanted his world to be. The character of Rincewind generally doesn't go through many changes after these beginning books, but the city of Ankh-Morpork does, and so do a few of the other characters that are more or less cameos in the first two books. Personally, I would add Equal Rites to this list of books where Terry is finding his feet. Each character set (Rincewind and his Luggage, Sam Vimes and the City Watch, The Lancre Witches, Death and his family, and Moist Von Lipwig and Spike) should be read in order of publication (Guards! Guards! should be read before Men at Arms as an example) if reading the City Watch books before the Industrial Revolution books, you should stop after Feet of Clay and read Going Postal in order to better understand the Semaphore network. The Watch books, up to Snuff better support some of the details about the Goblins and Sam Vines that are present in Raising Steam though this connection is less important than inserting Going Postal into the Watch books after Feet of Clay. There are a few other cameos and nods that are easier to get if you read the books in publication order, but they are few and far between. As an example, knowing about Death from his books is helpful for whenever he appears in passing in one of the other books. Similarly, knowing Brutha's story in Small Gods will help you understand more about the reverend, Mightily Oats, in Carpe Jugulum though this is also not necessary.   Other than those pointers, I suggest you read the books about the characters you enjoy. If you like Vimes, read the Watch books first (with going Postal after Feet of Clay) from there you will already be introduced to William DeWorde, who stars in The Truth and Moist Von Lipwig, whom you will know from Going Postal the rest of the Industrial Revolution books are a very fun read, so I recommend them. Additionally, you will have met Death one or two times from the Watch books, so Mort is a good book to read after the Watch series."

Vimes's spoon and CMOT purchase can be explained by the powerful self-correcting momentum of history (although in the case of CMOT's foods, it would have to have been a very powerful force indeed).  A third option is that at the start of the book the others were already in the modified timeline despite Vimes remembering the original timeline.  A fourth, and much more convincing theory, is that this is a detail that the author didn't care about and would handwave away with some babble about time, recollection, quantum theory and trousers."

Vimes specifically considers it was always him, given the eye patch etc, but discards it, as he remembers that keel looks different. Certainly once he's back in the present it's as if it was always him - hence vetinari's memory."

I'm not even talking about people who pass stuff off as their own (they're in a category of their own). I'm talking about the people who just don't acknowledge original artists/coders. In my opinion, it can take away from a user's experience.  If someone visits this page and likes the image of the Librarian, I want to acknowledge the artist who created that so that, if they want, the user can find other great works they have done (and they have done some other amazing works). Similarly, if someone likes the scrolling banner and wants to copy it, I want them to know that it didn't come from me so my code might not be a elegant as what /u/qtx wrote. They can then go to /r/books and see the original. It's why under the painting of DEATH shaking hands with Sir Terry in the side bar there is a link to artist's deviantart page. It costs nothing to be nice :)   EDIT: I just got a reply form /u/qtx and they are cool with me using their code."

Haven't gone through it in depth, but I have some thoughts (assuming you want to balance the set to be playable, and/or draftable. If not feel free to ignore me.):  Death is very flavorful, but imbalanced. His +2 and -10 aren't strong enough to ever justify using over his +0 or -4. (I can expand on this if you'd like)  If you want the set to be draftable, try making the cycle of ""chems"" uncommons. That way the serve as a push into a specific deck if you open them early, but aren't cluttering up packs for people who can't use them.  Death of Rats and Moist Lipwig should be legendary.  Divine Intervention shouldn't be a common. A five color card should be big, splashy, and at least rare. I think there is room to push it to mythic and up the power level.  Speaking of, you clearly pushed the multi-colored theme. I'm not seeing a lot of fixing though (or any actually). I think you could easily add a cycle of dual-lands, and a cycle of artifact mana rocks.  Vetinari should at the very least be blue black, if not mono-black. Blue-black is probably more accurate though. He was an assassin for some time, and is actually emblematic of the ideals of black as a color.   All that said, you did a lot I really like. Cards like Equal Rites are spot-on, and the apprentice cycle really hammer-home the flavor.  Characters you could add: Gaspode and CMOT Dibbler"
discworld,33574b,tombsar,3,Mon Apr 20 00:39:02 2015 UTC,"He was an assassin for some time, and is actually emblematic of the ideals of black as a color.   But Vetinari is one of the few assassins that doesn't wear black? I think it's in Night Watch that we are told a few times that he is exceptionally successful with unconventional clothing (mixed shades of grey and green), and was heavily inspired by camouflage found in nature (such as the orange and black stripes of a tiger)."
discworld,33574b,booms8,1 point,Mon Apr 20 10:33:06 2015 UTC,"I would love for you to expand on Death if you could; I definitely want to preserve as much flavor as possible, but balancing him is important to me.  Love the chems at uncommon; I originally wanted them there, but thought they weren't powerful enough to be uncommon.  Agreed on Rats and Moist; you're not the only person to say so, and I am trying to push a ""Legends Matter"" subtheme.  Vetinari is now essentially what Lady Margolotta was, filling the Black spot in the Legendary Lords cylce, with Mustrum Ridcully filling the Blue position (same abilities).  Working on a few additions (including Gaspode, Dibbler and tri-lands) and finding artwork for more cards and will post updates soon. If you have any more ideas (for cards or artwork) please feel free to make some recommendations.  Still trying to find flavorful mana rocks; thinking of a cycle off five 4-color rocks, but I dont want to reinvent the cluestones/banners with four colors."

discworld,330syg,Tiffany_Aching,26,Sat Apr 18 11:55:32 2015 UTC,"It sounds strange to me that the author considers Discworld to be young-adult fiction. There are some YA books with Maurice and Tiffany, but the series as a whole? Why is that, like because it's low fantasy rather than high fantasy? I also think it's kind of weird that he didn't know how popular Pratchett was until his passing... There are towns IRL that consider themselves sister cities with Ankh-Morpork, the AM crest on their town signs, and Pratchett was knighted for his literary contributions, but you don't know if they're popular?? Like ONE Google search, man. If you've been obsessed for 13 years, surely that must have happened once.   I both love the books intensely and kind of hate myself for being so obsessed with them.   Bro, you gotta accept you for you. It's okay to love this incredible other world. It'd be okay if it was ASoIaF world or HP world. They exist for us to love. There's no reason to be down on yourself for that."
discworld,330syg,Crustal_Math,11,Sat Apr 18 15:22:00 2015 UTC,Just what I was wondering. Can't see that this is YA series. Any YA who could read these enough to catch all the references and jokes before they ceased to be Y would be a strange person indeed.
discworld,330syg,yonthickie,3,Sat Apr 18 15:58:03 2015 UTC,I can see as a YA series in spite of your argument being completely valid.  There are many works of art that appeal to different people for different reasons. Just because someone doesn't get a lot of references doesn't mean there's not a story to be enjoyed.  One could argue that the younger the reader the better they'd be able to enjoy actual plotlines of Pratchett because they wouldn't enamoured with the allusions and resulting chuckling Pratchett creates to us (those of an older persuasion).  The only thing that would speak against the accesibility to children/YA would be Pratchett's vocabulary but even that usually isn't too distracting because a quick mind will fill in the gaps itself.
discworld,330syg,DebonaireSloth,6,Sat Apr 18 19:03:49 2015 UTC,I do not mean that a young adult could not enjoy the books but that they are not primarily aimed at a young audience which is what calling them YA sounds like. The fact that they can be enjoyed by many people with different levels of understanding does not indicate that they are aimed at one of them in particular.
discworld,330syg,yonthickie,3,Sat Apr 18 19:11:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but the last ten years or so have given me the feeling that the lable YA doesn't say much. If you look at things like Harry Potter, The Hunger Games, anything John Green, etc.: there's the lable YA but it's being devoured by adults equally.  Art finds its audience and labels don't mean much. That's what my sandblasted mind is probably trying to say."
discworld,330syg,DebonaireSloth,2,Sat Apr 18 20:19:11 2015 UTC,"His mention of Xanth and Earthsea being ""too much to grasp at the time"" made me think it's because it's low fantasy, as if the lack of complicated politics of the world and common English names rather than names with too many vowels stops Discworld from being for adults *to this author (edited to add that last phrase and take out an extra word)"

I agree and think you're spot on about the level of complication. For the politics, I usually explain the difference between the Discworld low-fantasy variety and the high fantasy variety with Star Wars as my example. Original Trilogy, you enter when there is no longer a governing council, just an emperor, his army, and the rebels. Names are one or two syllabals and are either common names or simple and from very few planets and systems (Luke, Han, Leia, etc). Easily accessible politics, easy to follow what's happening. In the prequels, it's a far more complicated at best and convoluted at worst. It's difficult to follow as everyone has crazy names and is from a variety of planets and systems (Quaigon, Ki-Ai-Munda, Sebulba?!)."

discworld,32wpa0,Imperatorian,5,Fri Apr 17 12:02:27 2015 UTC,"I think this is an underrated Discworld tale. While the Vetinari sub-plot is not Pratchett's best (it seems odd the Watch/Havelock can't solve a relatively straightforward crime quickly), it doesn't matter much when the main plot is so great.  I love how Pratchett talks about stories in a different way, in how the news is just another way of trying to understand the world. Like books, they help, but not enough, so that feeds our appetite for more.  His use of William is great. He's a good character but he realises he works better as a background player beyond this. His cameos in future Discworld novels always come as a pleasant surprise.  What do you all think? Thanks, as ever, for clicks and karma."

My speculation is that De Worde was meant to the type of character that Moist Von Lipwig turned out to be but pratchett pivoted away from that for some reason.

discworld,32op3s,GetMeOffReddit,45,Wed Apr 15 15:15:06 2015 UTC,"I've heard it explained that Rowling specifically chose not to describe certain attributes of most characters. Although a lot of people default to white, as people default to male (everyone on reddit is male until they say something to the contrary), there's nothing that says Hermione is white. Nor Harry white, for that matter. So I've heard that there's a community on Tumblr, in particular, who have embraced the idea of a black Hermione, and Indian Harry.   And personally, I'm fine with that. I certainly think the movie-Hermione was way too pretty, considering that among the little description of her, it seemed clear that she was NOT pretty. But you need pretty in movies to sell them, I suppose.  Either way, it's an interesting conversation one can have on the topic of expectations, society, and all that good stuff. Or not worry about it and just enjoy the books, of course."
discworld,32op3s,ReanimatedX,8,Wed Apr 15 15:25:48 2015 UTC,"Huh, I always figured she was Greek, with her incredibly bushy, curly hair and Greek name."
discworld,32op3s,roobens,15,Wed Apr 15 19:21:50 2015 UTC,"If you check out the list of notable people with that name the vast majority of them are British. Although it has a Greek root it's always been relatively popular here and I personally always associate it with posh English. I mean most names we use are Greek or Middle Eastern in origin but we don't think of them as such. And Granger is pretty damn English too. As to the overarching discussion, Hermione is clearly white. Rowling tends to only specifically point out race when it's a non-white person, ie Parvati, Cho, Kingsley, Angelina Johnson etc. Hermione is never literally described as white but the descriptions of her hair colour etc don't really point to a darker race."
discworld,32op3s,GetMeOffReddit,22,Wed Apr 15 20:31:54 2015 UTC,"(everyone on reddit is male until they say something to the contrary)   Wait, I'm the only one who envisions everyone to be women?   Hm, if it floats peoples boats then I have nothing against it. I didn't know Rowling specifically left it open to interpretation like that.    I certainly think the movie-Hermione was way too pretty, considering that among the little description of her, it seemed clear that she was NOT pretty. But you need pretty in movies to sell them, I suppose.   I strongly disagree with you here though. They hired a child actress for the movie. The fact that she grew up to be pretty isn't an issue, and definitely not an intended trick. And, if memory serves doesn't Hermoine go through some magick to fix her appearance in the books? Something about fixing her teeth? I'd imagine the implication of that is the same as what any young teen goes through, growing up you realize you want to look good and take steps to achieve that.   Edit: To clarify, I don't think Hermoine needed to be pretty for the movie to be good. Or that it's necessarily good or bad. But rather I think it's unlikely that it was an intended trick to get an audience to show up.   Eh. Regardless though, this is definitely interesting. I've got no issue with people putting in characters that they envision into the books, especially if the author left it open to interpretation. If it makes people happy to read it like that then all for."
discworld,32op3s,vonmonologue,10,Wed Apr 15 15:34:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the 4th book I think, the one with the dance at the end where her and Ron fumble their first attempts to admit they like each other. Either right before the dance or in the summer before she gets her frizzy hair tamed and her buckteeth shrunken down. Although this may have been in reaction to the casting of Emily Watson and a desire to get the book character looking closer to the actress.  Forgive me for my hazy memory; I didn't get into HP at all until right before the 7th film came out, at which point I started reading the first book on a whim and burned through the entire series in just under 2 months. So my memory of the sequency of events might be a bit muddled."
discworld,32op3s,GetMeOffReddit,2,Wed Apr 15 15:49:37 2015 UTC,"No worries if you got a few things messed up, that's roughly how I remember it too. It might have been a way for Rowling to tie Hermoine and Emma Watson closer in appearance. I honestly don't know there.   Man these books are good though, it just goes to show when we're sitting around talking about the details and how things worked while trying to remember what was and wasn't the actual way of things in it.

discworld,32op3s,Libriomancer,2,Wed Apr 15 16:07:29 2015 UTC,It might have been a way for Rowling to tie Hermoine and Emma Watson closer in appearance. I honestly don't know there.   Rowling is actually quoted saying she didn't let any of the actors influence her later writings except Evvana Lynch (Luna). It can be taken with a grain of salt (I also won't admit seeing golden arches makes me crave McD) but that is her story. It was at the James Joyce Awards but I can't find a link.

Not 100% true.  Hollywood could totally use makeup to make her less pretty if they wanted to. I'd say it'd even be easier than using makeup to make an ugly person more beautiful.  Besides it isn't like actors aren't conditioned / pressured into diets and whatnot. You often hear about how an actor hit the gym to get buffed before doing a role.

I remember when the first whispering of a Harry Potter movie first surfaced I started haunting the fan sites for every tidbit. When the now-legendary first picture of the main cast surfaced I immediately thought young Emma Watson was far too pretty to be Hermoine, and I wasn't alone. I remember rading that even Rowling thought she was too pretty, but kept the ""ugly duckling"" version to herself at the time."

There is a parallel between people hating people of the wrong race in Roundworld and the wrong blood in Wizard World, but I don't think Rowling intended to make her of a different skin colour to emphasize her struggle. Making her hated because of both her skin colour and blood seems a bit too preachy..."

We knew these people weren't white because she said something along those lines at one point when describing them. You don't have to tell people the characters are white when you have it set in England where the majority population is white, just like you don't have to point out people are black in a book set in Africa or that people are Asian in a book set in Japan.

This quote comes from Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Book 3), Chapter 4. I can't see what page it's on.  In reading the few paragraphs around it, I'm under the impression that all the kids were coming back from a summer break. I would guess that the line is to indicate that they both went on holiday/vacation to somewhere warm and sunny, while Harry did not.  Ron was heavily freckled, a trait of a fair-skinned person getting a lot of sun. Hermione was tanned, which is also a trait of someone getting a lot of sun but since she was not fair-skinned like Ron."
discworld,32op3s,roobens,11,Wed Apr 15 18:31:06 2015 UTC,"I'm not entirely convinced that this is meant to mean that Hermione isn't white. English people often say brown rather than tan, when both mean the same thing. It's obviously ambiguous but a little vernacular difference i've noticed."

Applejack,"" said the witch. The smith nodded. Everyone in Bad Ass made applejack in the winter, by leaving cider tubs outside overnight and taking out the ice until a tiny core of alcohol was left.  ""Well, you can drink lots of cider and you just feel better and that's it, isn't it?""   The smith nodded again.  ""But applejack, you drink that in little mugs and you don't drink a lot and you don't drink it often, because it goes right to your head?""

In the same way that foreigners who speak your language often sound very formal compared to the language commonly used, the English you have been taught is likely the most formal and officially recognized version of English.

The term was coined by George P. Krapp to refer to the literary technique of using nonstandard spelling that implies a pronunciation of the given word that is actually standard, such as wimmin for women; the spelling indicates that the character's speech overall is dialectal, foreign, or uneducated.   This form of nonstandard spelling differs from others in that a difference in spelling does not indicate a difference in pronunciation of a word. That is, it is dialect to the eye rather than to the ear.  It suggests that a character ""would use a vulgar pronunciation if there were one"" and ""is at the level of ignorance where one misspells in this fashion, hence mispronounces as well.""

discworld,32f3if,pocketknifeMT,39,Mon Apr 13 07:30:11 2015 UTC,"""Feet of Clay"" leaps to my mind as the book in which Sir Terry really started to see Discworld as a mirror not only for poking fun at the conventions of fantasy, but a means to truly understand the mythology of Humanity.   Or maybe it came earlier, with Small Gods, but for me, it was Feet of Clay even more than Guards! Guards!, that showed how amazingly versatile the Disc really was."
discworld,32f3if,Vaeon,23,Mon Apr 13 07:46:36 2015 UTC,"Small Gods for me was where it dawned on him that he could tell more than a story about a quirky place he made up and really rooted it in the real world.   That is my favourite book because you kind of feel the spark of realisation that he had.  OK, good fiction has to be relatable in some way but when he doesn't just relate but holds a mirror up to reality it was fantastic."
discworld,32f3if,zebbodee,14,Mon Apr 13 11:29:18 2015 UTC,"Small Gods, especially, always struck me as one of his angriest books. You feel the fury he has towards this sort of blind, destructive use of faith, and when Brutha stands before those doors and asks, begs, then demands a sign that all he's done was worth it, it's not played out stupidly. It's played out as entirely fair. Whenever I want to just read a good, painful cry of rage, I read that. It really does voice the thoughts of so very many disillusioned Christians, Muslims, Jews and people of other faiths."
discworld,32f3if,Knight117,6,Mon Apr 13 19:02:31 2015 UTC,"Worth noting that using fantasy as a means to truly understand the mythology of humanity was what made Tolkien's work so astonishing. For Tolkien it was an academic project (creating a language and working backwards), but for Pratchett it was a satirical project, and I think it was actually more profound and enjoyable for it."
discworld,32f3if,rovingtiger,24,Mon Apr 13 16:52:20 2015 UTC,"I think it happened after the first two books, to be honest. Others think it took a little while longer.

And I have a couple that are a little meh compared to the others. But yeah, he was a damned good storyteller with stories worth telling. <3"
discworld,32f3if,MsAlign,20,Mon Apr 13 07:47:33 2015 UTC,"For me it's Witches Abroad.  This is the first book to solidly delve into philosophy.  The theme of stories being constructs of people and people being constructs of stories is something Pratchett touches on repeatedly, but this is the first book in which he introduces the idea.  Granny Weatherwax really comes into her own in this book, as well.  The books prior to Witches Abroad are hit or miss.  Some I like, others, not so much.  All of the books after Witches Abroad are very good and I recommend them without hesitation."
discworld,32f3if,pratchettjob,14,Mon Apr 13 10:27:08 2015 UTC,"I'd say it's Wyrd Sisters, rather than Witches Abroad. The step-change in quality from the early Discworld novels is at its most noticeable here.  And it's full of a lot of the themes of the early Discworld - the power of stories, separating the difference between what people need and what people want.  It's also very funny."
discworld,32f3if,OriginalStomper,4,Mon Apr 13 11:11:04 2015 UTC,"Seconding Wyrd Sisters.  Because WS was the first to use the Discworld to parody other things besides heroic fantasy, and I'm a bit of a Shakespeare nerd.  Before WS, we have:  TCM and TLF ('nuff said), Equal Rites (a good tale featuring feminism, but little more than that), Mort (a good tale featuring Death and beginning to dig into the power of story, but again limited in scope), and Sourcery (little more than an entertaining Rincewind vehicle).

Then Reaper Man or Witches Abroad really made the world come to life and filled in the parts of the mirror that were needed to have the disc reflect ours.  Reaper Man and Witches Abroad had really good doses of world building and the characters weren't being introduced anymore. Death and Granny were challenged ideologically and put their stakes in the metaphorical ground giving them more gravitas. And the wit was top notch as well."

discworld,32f3if,thesuperevilclown,11,Mon Apr 13 17:39:31 2015 UTC,"like /u/Vaeon says, it would be the introduction and development of Samuel Vimes as a character. Men At Arms would be my choice, rather than Feet of Clay or Guards Guards, because in MAA we find the first real definition of a troll character (Detritus) as well as a dwarf (Cuddy) as a dwarf and not just a miniature human (like Nobby Nobbs), as well as The Streets of Ankh-Morpork being used for reference.  TL:DR - once Sir Terry had to refer back to notes from previous books to maintain consistency, rather than writing a fresh story with fresh characters every time.  either that or Sourcery. same reason tho - needing to refer to existing canon."
discworld,32f3if,Socratov,4,Mon Apr 13 13:30:47 2015 UTC,"Well, that's the thing: Terry's books didn't grow the beard (or jump the shark), but ,as is so often the case with a writer writing an extensive series of in universe books, the books progressed in quality instead of dragging on, as the trope would suggest.    TL;DR - Terry's books reverted not only many story tropes, but reversed jumping hte shark/growing the beard as well. Which is very impressive."
discworld,32f3if,DavidJMichaels,1 point,Mon Apr 13 19:50:08 2015 UTC,I'd argue Raising Steam jumped.
discworld,32f3if,sonog,2,Thu Apr 16 00:29:13 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I always thought this was the world view and direction Vetinari was driving Moist to create. Loved the book (But really there isn't anything of his I haven't enjoyed)"
discworld,32f3if,FrisianDude,2,Fri Apr 17 01:14:24 2015 UTC,"I dunno. The Harry King was the same King as in The Truth. Moist was just as Moist as in Going Postal and Making Money. Vetinari Vetinaired -ing perfectly. I often read about people not quite pleased about Raising Steam and I did notice in my last read through that the writing seeemed just a bit more simple, I still love the entirety of it."
discworld,32f3if,turtlehoof,2,Fri Apr 17 07:02:28 2015 UTC,Why do you think that?
discworld,32f3if,DavidJMichaels,1 point,Fri Apr 17 20:07:56 2015 UTC,"When Moist danced on the train.  Go back over that passage again.  There's no danger, no suspense.  He doesn't seem to do it out of the mad frantic need for danger that he usually does such things out of.  It feels gray and bland.  Same as the fight against the dwarf saboteurs.  Moist doesn't fight!  He talks.  That's the whole godsdamn point of him being Moist.  He's not a superhero, he's a trickster.  He knows it, we know it, the public probably knows it but they choose to believe glass is a diamond because its more entertaining that way.  But in Raising steam he's a slayer of fanatic dwarfs, a child-saving hero who dives under trains and wakes up in a hospital without a scratch, a man who is no longer conflicted about his role and place in life and is the city's shining beacon of modernity.  It bugs me."
discworld,32f3if,turtlehoof,2,Fri Apr 17 21:42:38 2015 UTC,"I'll agree straight-up that the book lacked a sense of urgency/danger - I think that's a given, what with the continuation of the embuggerence.  That being said, I thought Moist's traintop dancing made sense. It wasn't very excitingly written, but it makes sense. He's a fraud, a con-artist, he spins stories...and the second he saw the train, he saw a story. Consider the cinematic trope (if not cliche) of fighting on a traintop, and it's very much in his nature to want to be up there. It was definitely written a bit, ""and then he did this, and then he stopped doing that,"" though.  As for the fighting, I think the fact that he was basically drugged by the goblin goes some way towards why that happened. And saving the kids was more of a human reaction that he then had the opportunity to spin in his favour when the newspapers came calling.  Now you mention it, the sum of those moments definitely doesn't reflect Moist as a character. He'd wheedle his way out of things rather than be forced into heroic physicality. It's like Pratchett tried to force Vimes (decent, brave), Rincewind (so scared he can fight through panicked flailing) and Moist into one character for that book."
discworld,32f3if,DavidJMichaels,1 point,Fri Apr 17 21:57:34 2015 UTC,"And Moist gets caught doing it and uses his authority to shrug it off.  Moist doesn't get caught.  He should have climbed up and thought about doing it - started to step out and the train shakes him, nearly knocking him off a bridge or something.  Then when the fight up top comes he has to mutter something to her like 'that was for fun, this time its important.'  Plus the fatherly moment with Vimes shaking his hand after the kids rather than Vimes chewing out Moist and King for having such a danger in the first place.  Harry King being tear-eyed over it was weird too.  The man throws accountants down the stairs.  Why not a heartfelt scene of Granny and You where she dangles a string infront of the cat and then picks it up and snuggles it saying how much she loves it?    Adora even lost her teeth.  She should have flipped out at him for 3 pages after the fight - goblin potion or not.  I get it, its a goodbye book and its full of longing for family and stability.  Characters grow and change but they don't do so by totally kicking the pattern they've held for decades all at once."

discworld,32f3if,dantemp,6,Mon Apr 13 21:33:10 2015 UTC,"It's very subjective question. If you are asking when it started to get through moral lessons - the third book. If you are asking when it started to get really really amazing - Guards! Guards! If you are asking when it started to get the moral lessons amazingly right - Small Gods.  And I'm pretty certain that anyone being on the same page with me would be statistical probability, because everyone gets touched by Sir Terry in a different way. What we have in common is that we all did."
discworld,32f3if,turtlehoof,2,Tue Apr 14 10:57:05 2015 UTC,"Late response, but I think you're pretty spot on there. Guards! Guards! is the first great story and Small Gods is the first properly meaningful (for lack of a better word) one."
discworld,32f3if,foreverascholar,6,Fri Apr 17 20:09:13 2015 UTC,"As someone who has read the first ten of his books in the last week, I would definitely say that either Guards! Guards! or Mort was when I started to see the same stuff that made me fall in love with Pratchett when I read Going Postal."
discworld,32f3if,greymonk,2,Mon Apr 13 15:55:05 2015 UTC,Mort is where it happens for me.
discworld,32f3if,iamtheowlman,3,Mon Apr 13 22:11:59 2015 UTC,"In the audiobooks, Nigel Planer narrated up to Carpe Jugulum in a dull monotone sort of voice.  Stephen Briggs began narrating at the Fifth Elephant and it's wonderful (He sounds like what you'd think Vetinari would sound like all the time). Though there are some things I miss - Fred Colon used to be Irish and stupid, now he's just stupid.  For me, that's when Discworld really coalesced."
discworld,32f3if,MsAlign,5,Mon Apr 13 13:02:49 2015 UTC,"Call me blasphemous, but I like Nigel Planer.  I love Stephen Briggs, too, but he's got like 5 different background character accents and you'll get things like Miss Maccalariat sounding pretty much like Wee Mad Arthur."
discworld,32f3if,ChiperSoft,3,Mon Apr 13 17:33:07 2015 UTC,"I think they both had their strong points.  Nigel's Fred was by far the superior, as was his voice for Death, but Stephen had the better Vimes and Vetinari.  I dunno how anyone could call Nigel monotone, he had a massive range."
discworld,32f3if,iamtheowlman,2,Mon Apr 13 18:09:40 2015 UTC,"I mean when he was reading the narration, the bits that weren't dialogue. Briggs always has this snap to his voice at the end of sentences that Planer just lacks. It's like Briggs is having a particularly pointed conversation with the listener, while Planer is just reading it.  For example:  ""...resulting in the collapse of everything that is possible to exist.  ...Again.""  Vs:  "" . . . resulting in the collapse of everything that is possible to exist. Again."""
discworld,32f3if,linsell,2,Mon Apr 13 21:37:26 2015 UTC,"I felt like there was a slow burn that slowly grew over time. Mort has a special place in my heart, and Guards Guards is just fantastic, but I'm not sure if there was a turning point. I liked them all, with a few exceptions that I found a little boring in places (Sorcery, Unseen Academicals etc)."
discworld,32f3if,CaptnYossarian,1 point,Mon Apr 13 11:38:39 2015 UTC,UA is at the opposite end of the timeline and would be on the jumping the shark trope rather than the growing the beard example above.
discworld,32f3if,Blindkingofbohemia,2,Mon Apr 13 12:24:15 2015 UTC,I loved Unseen Academicals. What does everyone have against it?
discworld,32f3if,CaptnYossarian,1 point,Wed Apr 15 19:39:52 2015 UTC,"I was pointing out more that ""growing the beard"" happens early on in a series, rather than a value judgement on Unseen Academicals as jumping the shark in the series, because by no means is it gimmicky.  That said, I really didn't find UA as engaging as other books in the collection, and I pointed the finger at the overt focus on the oppression of goblins, as well as a generally darker tone that had been growing since Thud. If you contrast the way the oppression of Golems is handled in Feet of Clay vs UA, I found it a little too heavy handed in the latter, a little too morose. It was an important message, and the story did engage me, but it's not one from the collection that I'm going to pick up for a re-read with any regularity."
discworld,32f3if,Blindkingofbohemia,1 point,Wed Apr 15 23:52:49 2015 UTC,"Are you sure you're not thinking of Snuff? I don't think goblins feature at all in Unseen Academicals (but they're the centre point of the plot in Snuff) and I think the prejudice against orcs was handled extremely well in UA, even when compared with the golems in Feet of Clay - everyone disliked golems because they were taking jobs and they were creepy, which is why the prejudice was less... Overt. Everyone is terrified of the orc in UA because orcs rip people's heads off.   Further, I thought the idea and discussion of worth - 'do you leave the world a brighter place than when you entered it' - was both a powerful theme and incredibly moving, given Sir Terry's state of health when the book was written.   Finally, I actually thought that - despite the heavy-handedness of the oppression we see in UA - it really did add to the sense of hope the story fostered. Although Feet of Clay made a great discussion of notions of freedom, the abject terror and resultant prejudice toward orcs we see in UA really carried the more optimistic themes of the book to great affect. In UA we see that, given the opportunity, even the most terrifying leopard can change his shorts... But we're also given a powerful counterpoint to the typical Vimes theme of the average person being petty, small-minded, and two good opportunities away from criminality; in the scene when Nutt attempts to escape Ankh-Morpork and is accosted by Trev, Juliet and Glenda on the coach in front of a crowd of those same average people, Pratchett shows us that they too can change their shorts: they're kind, supportive, and accepting of Nutt, even though he's an orc.  Overall I thought Unseen Academicals, far from being a poorer, overly heavy-handed or morose instalment in the Discworld series was very nearly a crowning glory - it was optimistic, thoughtful, offered an insight into Sir Terry's mind and moved the story of Ankh-Morpork forward."
discworld,32f3if,CaptnYossarian,1 point,Thu Apr 16 04:07:09 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I did indeed mix up Snuff and UA to a degree with the confusion of Orcs & Goblins (how speciesist of me), but I felt like that with UA to a degree, and it was only further with Snuff.  I appreciate what Pratchett did throughout the series in representing racial tensions through the various species in the Disc melding in Ankh-Morpork, but both UA and Snuff felt heavy with the material - where previous ones hadn't. Even FoC wasn't the true mark of integration for Golems that UA seems to jump to for Orcs and Snuff for Goblins - that took until Going Postal. That staggering of acceptance felt more real, for whatever reason.  I also didn't think that these books were bad by any means, but they don't sit prominently in mind - and in a collection as wide and deep as the books of the Discworld, that's going to happen. For me, Night Watch is the crowning moment of the series, but then I've always been more partial to the Watch series - but hey, everyone likes something different, and I'm glad others liked UA more, because its message of acceptance of difference is pretty good."

And this guy busted into some poor couple's home to aggressively play the drums on his groin!    And this one, he's making some reluctant nobleman play another weird groin instrument. If you have ten minutes or so, look at the party that the army of the dead are having terrorising mankind in Triumph of Death from the 1500s. They're playing music, lighting fires, digging up their friends, chasing people with hounds, there's even a skeleton wearing a dead guys face!

discworld,32blgj,Rekreativc,18,Sun Apr 12 10:38:20 2015 UTC,"My feeling is that as Terry was clearly in the end stage of his life since finishing the book, they probably decided that the publicity and hype of a new book being released was not going to be good for him and his family. That said, I hope there is an element of 'goodbye' in it - I'm not sure I'd want discworld to end metaphorically mid-sentence."

discworld,32blgj,Blindkingofbohemia,14,Wed Apr 15 19:42:55 2015 UTC,I don't think they've changed the scheduled release date - I remember reading late last year that we'd have another book in September 2015.  I think what /u/girlfrodo said is probably accurate though - I imagine Sir Terry knew things weren't looking good and probably tried to put together some closure for his readers.
discworld,32blgj,mellistu,12,Sun Apr 12 12:47:51 2015 UTC,"I figured that was what Raising Steam was about - a last grand tour of the Disc, visiting a lot of old faces, answering a lot of unanswered questions, and so on and so forth."
discworld,32blgj,wrincewind,8,Sun Apr 12 13:29:29 2015 UTC,I did get that feel from Raising Steam.  I'm hoping we'll get something similar with this last book as well.
discworld,32blgj,mellistu,3,Sun Apr 12 13:32:49 2015 UTC,Pretty much every character (except the named witches) had a cameo in Raising Steam - it definitely felt like a goodbye to me.

Paul Kidby posted this on his blog:   I am currently enjoying drawing the art for Terry Pratchett's next Discworld novel, The Shepherd's Crown, which will be published in the autumn.   The post is dated Feb 6th 2015, which predates Pratchett's death and the post itself confirms the publisher's release schedule."
discworld,32blgj,plastikmissile,9,Mon Apr 13 22:13:32 2015 UTC,"There is always a lag from finishing writing to publishing. We often knew what was bring published a year or two years ahead with Terry, so this is not abnormal at all."
discworld,32bpux,Luteraar,10,Sun Apr 12 11:56:46 2015 UTC,"I feel that the novels are best read in publication order. Discworld society itself evolves over the course of the series, from a generic medieval fantasy world to a modernising industrial society, and that change can best be appreciated by reading the books in the order Terry wrote them. There are also numerous cameo appearances and references that can only be fully understood by reading the books that way.  The downside of publication order is that the first handful of books are weaker than the rest and it took Terry several years to figure out exactly what he wanted Discworld to be. So you have to be willing to power through some novels you might not necessarily like before you get to the really good stuff, but by doing so you will make the great novels read even better.  The next best way to read them is in subseries order. Just pick a cast of characters that seem interesting to you, and read through their novels in order. I personally don't find that as satisfying as publication order, but some people seem to prefer it that way. If you do decide to go that route, I'd recommend the City Watch novels as that subseries contains some of Terry's very best work."
discworld,32bpux,TheGodBen,2,Sun Apr 12 14:21:48 2015 UTC,"The subseries order seems like a good idea, it's also what /u/foul_ol_ron recommended. He also mentioned the City Watch.  You also make some good points to reading it in publication order though.  Thanks, you've given me a lot to think about."
discworld,32bpux,Hactar42,4,Sun Apr 12 14:51:59 2015 UTC,"I started reading in publication order, then after getting to Guards! Guards! I thought I would switch to subseries and read the Watch books. However, I quickly found that I didn't like this. For one I skipped over Small Gods and two there were new characters that I didn't know about. For example the Unseen University gets a new Archchancellor in Moving Pictures that I was completely unaware of. After one book, I switched back to publication order.   I've just started on The Last Continent and I've really enjoyed watching Sir Terry's universe grow and evolve. Even after 22 books in, I continue to look forward to each new adventure, and I can't wait to read them."
discworld,32bpux,calantorntain,2,Sun Apr 12 16:49:39 2015 UTC,I recommend publication order.
discworld,32bpux,TheGodBen,2,Sun Apr 12 16:51:40 2015 UTC,"One big downside of reading each subseries individually is that it causes some timeline screwiness. Say you read the City Watch novels and decide to read the Rincewind novels next. By reading The Colour of Magic after Snuff you would be going back in time around 25 years, and a lot changed in that time. The structure of Ankh-Morpork society is completely different; there'd be no Sam Vimes, no Archchancellor Ridcully, no semaphore network, etc. You go from reading a rich, complex, living world to a shallow and underdeveloped one. Then you'd have to make that transition again if you decided to read the Witch novels, or the Death novels.  In contrast, publication order is roughly chronological. There's no jumping through time, everything is seamless."
discworld,32bpux,LindavL,3,Sun Apr 12 18:40:17 2015 UTC,"I would say that if you plan to read all of them and are not restricted by availability (the library might not always have the next one available straight away) publishing order is the best option. Although the first books are not as strong as the others, reading in publication order allows you to see the world develop. First reading some of the newer novels or reading one of the subseries will probably cause disappointment later on, as the older novels will be not as good as what you have read up to that point.   If you're planning to read only part of the novels I would pick a subseries that you find interesting and read the books of that particular series first. You can always read the rest of the books if you like.  If availability is an issue you could read them in a random order. It is not the most ideal route because some of the newer books refer to the older ones, but all the stories are comprehensible without having read any of the other books (although you will obviously miss some things)."
discworld,32bpux,tbull001,1 point,Sun Apr 12 17:34:39 2015 UTC,"Availability is not an issue, I'm reading on an e-reader right now. I'll most certainly be buying a couple of them but if there are any I can't find I'll just read them on the e-reader."
discworld,32bpux,jgf1123,2,Sun Apr 12 21:55:10 2015 UTC,"While I agree that his first few books are not as strong as others - they are still good.  As someone who had no choice but to read them in publication order, I loved the early works and was in awe of how good the later ones became.   Read them the way they were written and enjoy the evolution - don't do the ""best"" first and view the early works as a chore and somehow sub-standard."
discworld,32bpux,HerculesQEinstein,2,Sun Apr 12 16:15:24 2015 UTC,"The two series that are most like Small Gods (Pratchett's take on faith and organized religion) are Death and the Witches, so I would check out either Mort or Wyrd Sisters next."
discworld,32bpux,SuramKale,1 point,Sun Apr 12 19:06:41 2015 UTC,"Read the Watch stuff first. Start with Guards! Guards! It's a great staring point because even though it is a bit slower than the later books, it introduces some of the most important characters in the series."

discworld,32bpux,dantemp,1 point,Sun Apr 12 18:33:15 2015 UTC,"I agree with publication order. While The Colour of Magic & The Light Fantastic introduce the world and some characters, and Equal Rites is the introduction of Granny Weatherwax, they exist in a sort of proto-discworld - especially the first two. So if you're worried about quality, you can start at Mort where the series starts getting it's book-legs."
discworld,32bpux,foul_ol_ron,1 point,Tue Apr 14 15:06:06 2015 UTC,"Publication order is a must. Absolute must. Small Gods is one of the best places to start, because it has almost no ties with the rest of the world, but almost any other has lots. Color of Magic and Light Fantastic may be not his best work, but they do a wonderful job of setting up the crazy world. The witches series start slow and a bit boring, but they do show you how one can be very reasonable in this crazy world. And they will eventually grow on you. Every book is a small evolution. The city watch is the best storyline by all accounts, but you will enjoy it much more if you get to it in the right way."
discworld,32bpux,foul_ol_ron,1 point,Wed Apr 15 08:43:27 2015 UTC,"I probably wouldn't read them in publication order if I had the entire series to go. There's a number of reading guides online (sorry-I'm on mobile) that you could google.

I love how he uses the novel to ring in the changes within the Discworld. Magic still happens but technology is placed to the fore more here than in any other novel.  I'm a huge fan of this. What do you all reckon?

However, the last third is brilliant and really surprises you given what you have read before. Getting to that bit is a bit of a struggle.  I feel it's a better book to think about in retrospect, rather than read at the time."
discworld,323y4k,Sauce_Pain,3,Fri Apr 10 15:53:08 2015 UTC,"In a way, MR reminded me a lot of This War of Mine in showing the unglamorous part of war.

I did enjoy Raising Steam but it did feel final and the beloved characters changed a lot. That said the story was enjoyable and engaging, it had great moments of none as memorable as in past books. It felt like a farewell too one of my favorite characters, not the one I expected but one that fit him oddly well.  I look forward to the last Tiffany book, I like a well written intelligent female lead. I look forward to seeing the man with the greatest name on the Disc, Rob Anybody, again. I felt like I Shall Wear Midnight could easily have been the last book in that arch, the story just felt like a fitting place to stop, so I am curious what Terry has dreamed up.  To Terry, who brought us all so much joy. I pledge to buy this final book, savor it and not feel sadness that it is the end."

discworld,31szz6,HavelockAT,8,Tue Apr 7 22:49:25 2015 UTC,"While I don't think Pratchett was too concerned about that sort of thing, I vaguely remember something about Victor Tugelbend's fees (or maybe it was just his expenses?) being paid by bequest of his uncle in Moving Pictures, so it looks like there were fees, as with the guilds.  I also have a feeling there was something about this in the one where Granny Weatherwax is trying to get someone into the university (I think it was Esk in Equal Rites) but I'm not completely sure."
discworld,31szz6,BlastedFemur,16,Tue Apr 7 22:57:18 2015 UTC,"Victor's tuition is indeed paid by a trust fund from his uncle that stipulates the money will pay for his education to be completed. However, he must get at least a score of 80 on his finals or the trust will no longer pay his tuition. As the passing grade for Wizard exams is 86, Victor games the system by constantly ALMOST passing, usually with a score around 83.  In Unseen Academicals, the Wizards are informed that, unless they participate in a football game (poore mann's funne) they will stop receiving funding from a trust.  In still another description (either Unseen Academicals or one of the other books concerning Wizards) it is mentioned that the University is so expansive into various dimensions that all foodstuffs eaten on campus are not only cooked there, but also grown and harvested there as well.  Finally, in Moving Pictures and Unseen Academicals it is noted that the head Wizards are not used to paying for anything, specifically theater tickets, banged grains, and meat pies.  From all of this it can be assumed that although the University gets money from tuition and other trust funds, they don't necessarily spend it on day to day items. In opposition of the second half of that statement, however, in The Science of Discworld 1 it is mentioned that Ponder Stibbons dreads the question ""How does it work?"" only slightly more than ""How much will it cost?"" and the Archchancillor does make a mention that the new magical reaction engine cost a little under $55,000 AM, which is quite a lot of money as far as the Discworld is concerned, as a single letter posted anywhere in the city is only 1p.  Edit: I also forgot to mention that in The Truth it is mentioned that Wizards frown on movable printed type for magical works, but have no qualms about using it to reduce their bills to the Guild of Engravers, since they constantly go through so much paperwork."
discworld,31szz6,Jammintk,2,Tue Apr 7 23:31:51 2015 UTC,"Wow, good writeup, I had forgotten all of the stuff from Unseen Academicals that happened because the wizards had to play a match. Haven't read any of the science ones."

The Bursar hadn't had any money left because he'd bought 17 doughnuts. But maybe that's an exception."
discworld,31szz6,Jammintk,2,Wed Apr 8 02:13:35 2015 UTC,"Also, in The Truth it is mentioned that what used to be a magical dump of a district near the University was recently turned into a neighborhood where one could go to buy magical items, such as Dis-Organizers. I believe it was touted to be a great partnership between the University, representing the magical people of the city, and the office of the Patrician, representing the other more mundane people.  It wouldn't be too far fetched to say that the University may get some sort of rent from this district or perhaps some sort of payment from those that practice magic within the city and sell their wares. Perhaps the University also solicits donations from the various wizard graduates that live all over the Disc, much like universities do of their graduate s here on Roundworld."
discworld,31szz6,DurMan667,3,Wed Apr 8 02:38:26 2015 UTC,They don't need money. Who would ever think of asking a wizard to pay?

You're bang on in saying the book was both silly and serious to the extreme, and it really gets it's messages across without detracting from the enjoyment of the story. I found Sir Terry's later war book, Monstrous Regiment, really enjoyable too. Although it deals with different themes and doesn't focus on our beloved watch crew, its certainly a great read once you get to that point in the series."

That's really refreshing in a genre like Fantasy where a lot of books/authors relish the opportunity to write out a good pitched battle and it can seem easier to just fight it out rather than explore some creative ways to reach an understanding."
discworld,31k1v1,madmoneymcgee,1 point,Tue Apr 7 15:38:09 2015 UTC,"I'm of two minds about Jingo.  The Watch books tend to be Vimes-centric.  I believe Pratchett said he started Guards! Guards! with the idea that Carrot would be the hero, but up popped Vimes, and the book just couldn't not revolve around him.  Taken to the extreme, we get a book like Night Watch, which is my favorite Watch book.  What can I say, I love me some Vimes.  Jingo (and The Fifth Elephant) is when the Watch is taken to the other extreme and becomes an ensemble cast.  There's the Vimes thread, the Nobby/Colon thread, Angua has her own adventure for a while.  Now some of my favorite TV shows are ensemble casts: Firefly, Community.  They're great because we get to see different characters play off each other.  But I feel like Jingo is the least cohesive Watch book because it feels like they're running in parallel rather than weaving together.  Vimes does his detective work, sets his sights, chases his mark to another continent, gets captured, learns he got it wrong, sets off on the real criminal... and then Vetinari steps in and makes most of it moot.  That, and after years of Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Nigeria, Somalia, eastern Ukraine, and now Yemen, I really wish there was a quick way to wrap up wars.  Leshp disappears, Carrot brings out a football, people stop dying.  There some cognitive dissonance because wars in the real world do not wrap up as neatly as in books.    Anyway, I enjoy Jingo.  It's a fun adventure, it provides character pieces for a lot of beloved characters, it has important morals and some poignant moments (the disorganizer's what-might-have-been...), but not my favorite Watch book."

discworld,31i56e,Radijs,10,Sun Apr 5 08:15:00 2015 UTC,"From what I've been told by others, most good tattoo artists like to do their own designs. And people say it's much better to find an artist you really like and then travel to them rather than just going with whoever's nearby. Of course, this might be difficult if you have travel/budget restrictions. But still it might be worth looking into tattoo artists you can get to and seeing if any of them can design what you want (and make sure to look at lots of their previous work). Good luck!"
discworld,31i56e,HarlequinValentine,5,Sun Apr 5 08:35:04 2015 UTC,Find a design online you like and show it to the artist.  They will come up with a design based on the location you want it.  Depending on where you plan on getting it any design someone gave you here might not be appropriate for the location. Always always check an artists work before you get a tattoo.  They should have a portfolio available in the shop and probably online as well.  A good artist will work with you to get a design you are happy with.  They want to as proud of their work as you are happy with the end product.

discworld,31eb02,WonderBreadBreasts,9,Sat Apr 4 06:21:49 2015 UTC,"Opinions will vary but the general consensus is that the first few books aren't the best pieces of literature. To get a taste for some of Discworld's best try something like 'Guards!Guards' , 'Small Gods'  or 'Going Postal' . Most of the books are reasonably stand alone and any gaps are filled in as you go along so really it doesn't matter that much where you start.  If you find you like any of them then you have two choices: read in the order of publication and take in a mix of everything or alternatively have a look at the linking storylines and read them in that order.   There really is no right or wrong answer here so  just try one of them and see where it takes you."
discworld,31eb02,Medza,7,Sat Apr 4 10:00:25 2015 UTC,"I agree - Small Gods, Guards! Guards! and Going Postal are perfect introduction. Going Postal is a great example of his later work - slightly more subdued, philosophical, but still funny as well. The other two are great 'early Pratchetts' - they are more obviously fantasy based.

It is a very very strong book. I do love the Witches of Lancre novels, even though their reviews have not had the same hits that the Watch novels have on the site.  But I found it rehashed a lot of novels I had read before - Lords and Ladies and Small Gods, to name two.  It's still on the upper tier of Pratchett though.

Pattern is based on nothing but the artists interpretation of my vague thoughts/ideas.  My wife has been getting tattooed by the same artist for ~5yrs. He's become a good friend of ours and he & I had been discussing me getting my first tattoo for a long time. I just couldn't come up with something I was comfortable getting permanently etched into my skin.  I've always loved the relationship between humans and technology, so I wanted something to reflect that. I spent months collecting images relating to that theme and sent them to the artist. Pictures of circuit boards, techno-runes from video games, the weird tech-virus-veins on Tony Stark in Iron Man 2, stuff like that.  After a while the artist and I sat down to discuss these images, and he did something I wasn't expecting; he pulled an idea from my own head I didn't even realise I had. He'd noticed that a lot of the examples I gave him were sketched out in rough drafts, and he wondered if this was something I wanted. It honestly wasn't what I had initially thought of, but once he described it I knew that's exactly what I wanted. So he drew up a draft that was basically part tech/circuitry themed, part biological, and made to look like it was ""painted"" with a brush. I made one small change to the draft, but it was basically perfect.  He ended up calling the style ""bio-Sumi-circuit"" in reference to the type of painted art. It doesn't have any specific meaning or significance other than expressing my fascination with and love for the relationship between humans and technology. I plan on getting my leg done in a similar fashion, and hope to come up with a dragon inspired by the same style to eventually put on my back (a not-so-subtle nod to me being from Wales). But that's a long way off."

In the process of body scarification, scars are formed by cutting or branding the skin by varying methods (sometimes using further sequential aggravating wound healing methods at timed intervals, like irritation), to purposely influence wound healing to scar more and not scar less. Scarification is sometimes called cicatrization (from the French equivalent).

Nah, but seriously, per the sidebar:   About This Subreddit:  For items relating to Discworld. Also, some non-Discworld content is okay, especially if it relates to Terry Pratchett.

discworld,30v94h,Lobin,2,Tue Mar 31 08:45:29 2015 UTC,I wish I knew how to format comments as well as this.  Footnotes?  Really?  I'm impressed.
discworld,30v94h,Lobin,2,Tue Mar 31 14:41:57 2015 UTC,"It's easy - I'll show you, because I hope more will use footnotes on reddit. :)  So at the end of my message, a line with three underscores creates the html <hr>:  ___   becomes:    (If you have RES, you can ""view source"" on my original message and see)  The numbers for the footnotes are easy to do, although I have Linux, and therefore the Compose key, and it's even easier for me to use actual superscripted numbers: ¹²³⁴⁵⁶⁷⁸⁹⁰ - but you can use reddit's Markdown to make them as well:  text^(1)   becomes:  text1  Technically, you don't have to use the parentheses, but if you don't and you end a sentence, it'll pull your punctuation like this¹. So better to use parentheses like this1. And my period is saved! :)  And so finally, an individual footnote I use italics and a single level of superscript, like this:  *^(¹ this is a footnote)*   becomes:  ¹ this is a footnote  Note that you can't use parentheses in your footnotes using this method. If you need to use parens, you'll have to superscript each word:  *^¹ ^this ^is ^another ^footnote ^\(obviously)*   Becomes:  ¹ this is another footnote (obviously)  Note that I had to escape the parenthesis so it would show the actual character. But if you don't use parentheses, you don't have to learn this bit.  It's easy once you do it a couple of times. :)  So to sum up, here's the source to a short theoretical message using a footnote:     This is a reply¹.  ___  *^(¹ it totally is)*      See? Easy peasy! :)"

discworld,30t5ya,digitaldevil,1 point,Tue Mar 31 05:24:10 2015 UTC,"I read the lot, even the optional side stories. Magicians End was what it needed to be and tied up most of the important loose ends. It did suffer the same problem as you always get with those epic runs though, trying to pull in all the characters ends up with some major players being a cameo only, some were introduced to basically get killed off so not too many of the main characters bite the bullet. So many big things to get in, including a couple of faux final battles that each seems a little thin too. After lots of build up on some story lines there were some major changes of fortune/allegiance that seemed conveniently sudden to fit the timeline. The ending was a little trite, to be expected I suppose as it was foreshadowed pretty hard but you kind of wanted those rewards for the sacrifices the heros had made.   7/10 nice to get story arc to a conclusion but felt a bit rushed IMO"

Kingfisher, and has a great compilation of some of her short stories available on EBook called Toad Words, as well as a fun little novella Nine Goblins (a very Pratchett like story of Goblins, a wizard, and an elven veterinarian), and her newest novella The Seventh Bride.  I HIGHLY recommend checking out Toad Words to see if you like her style, and it's only a few bucks:   http://www.amazon.com/Toad-Words-Other-Stories-Kingfisher-ebook/dp/B00MFXJMGI/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8  Many of the stories in Toad Words were first printed on her blog.  To check a few out before hand I'll post a couple links.  Here's link to a short story on her site called NEVER, to get an idea for her style.  Kind of a quick spin on Peter Pan:  http://www.redwombatstudio.com/2011/10/27/never/  And one of my favorites, The Wolf and the Woodsman , a twist on Red Riding Hood:  Part 1:  http://www.redwombatstudio.com/2011/08/22/the-wolf-and-the-woodsman/  Part 2:  http://www.redwombatstudio.com/2011/08/24/the-wolf-and-the-woodsman-part-ii/  EDIT:  After reading a bunch of Amazon reviews I have to agree that maybe you should really check out Nine Goblins, as so many people are comparing it to Pratchett."

Her Parasol Protectorate Series is REALLY good, and is reminiscent of some Discworld aspects (i.e. magic-y stuff happens with some steampunk aspect).    The series is kind of like Pride and Predjudice meets Werewolves/Vampire/Ghosts and a smattering of The Truth styled technology.  She's a really good writer, and very small-time/unknown.  I love her works.  The new series (first book, ""Prudence"") just started, which is the sequel to the first series."
discworld,30t5ya,Trihorn,1 point,Thu Apr 2 14:48:33 2015 UTC,"My personal choice; Mercury Falls (and the subsequent ""Mercury"" sequels) by author Robert Kroese.  He's the closest any modern/new author has come to matching the enjoyment I get from TP novels. They're thoughtful, well researched, and hilarious at times. Where TP excelled at social commentary and witty views on philosophy/modern technology, RK does the same with an extensive knowledge of religious history and dogma mixed in with laugh out loud funny character interactions and story arcs.  I met the guy once. He's really nice and awkward, like every good author usually is. Thoroughly recommend, I've read the first 3 books. He actually personally sent me the second or third one for free just because I was an early supporter. Just randomly asked me on Twitter once ""Hey, want a free book?"" Neat guy, good writing."

It stars Rincewind the Wizard (voiced by Eric Idle) and is set on Terry Pratchett's Discworld. The game's plot is based roughly on the events in the book Guards! Guards!, but with Rincewind substituted for Sam Vimes. The game contains elements of Moving Pictures.   There are four other Discworld games: a direct sequel to Discworld, titled Discworld II: Missing Presumed...!? (Discworld II: Mortality Bytes! in North America), Discworld Noir (a stand alone story starring an original character), a text adventure called The Colour of Magic which strictly adheres to the events of the first Discworld novel and another game based on The Colour of Magic released on mobile phones titled Discworld: The Colour of Magic.  Discworld has been praised for its humour, voice-acting and graphics, though there have been criticisms concerning its gameplay and puzzles.

As per the sidebar, he himself didn't recommend starting with CoM, although I've always said - give it a try (as you have) - and if it doesn't work, maybe try Guards, Guards and go back to it later.  He started out :very: silly, almost parodying fantasy... then later on writing solid fantasy in his own right.  Also, just to say... you're welcome here, main account or alt, and it's not embarrassing here! :)"
discworld,30qtoj,shmolives,7,Sun Mar 29 22:48:03 2015 UTC,"Alt account because friends know my main and I  would be embarrassed around them,  not you.   It's not the silliness that I'm finding difficult. It just seems like a lack of context such that the scenes don't make sense.  There's a difference between lack of understanding of the universe (a scene in a bar earlier) that I can skip over, and scenes like the one in my OP that I cannot even picture in my head.   The latter has me thinking it's not the story but rather that his writing style may just not be for me."

No worries, as said - you're welcome regardless :)   his writing style   His writing style changed drastically (imho) by his ~4th/5th book. Like... Witches Abroad is early, but almost a different author imho. Guards Guards is definitely very good, which is why it's probably the most recommended to go with. :) I guess I'd recommend Witches Abroad, except if you're struggling with Colour of Magic, best to get far enough along to give you a sense of what most of the Discworlds are like. :)"
discworld,30qtoj,calantorntain,12,Sun Mar 29 23:00:30 2015 UTC,"So.. Confirmed that I'm an idiot..  I looked it up and found) this:   Rincewind is menaced by Stren Withel, the thief Ymor's right-hand-man, but is saved by the Luggage.   This jives with the next scene, in which the Luggage catches up to Rincewind and has a dead guy in it.  Maybe I just need to eat something... my brain is clearly not working.

It was one of the most rewarding feelings... like I'd begun to understand a second language, when really Sir Terry just had an amazing skew on things. It helped to read the book with an internal 'voice' similar to the narrator to HHGTTG. Dry English humour.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTNuldPhP20"
discworld,30qtoj,emddudley,3,Tue Mar 31 14:55:37 2015 UTC,"I'm reading them in publishing order, and I can definitely see the change right around Moving Pictures / Witches Abroad. Definitely a difference in his style."

The Color of Magic takes a lot of inspiration from themes commonly found in other fantasy works.  So if you are unfamiliar with what it is parodying, it will be harder to read.  This is less of an issue with his other works (apart from perhaps The Light Fantastic and Eric)"
discworld,30qtoj,texasyankee,4,Mon Mar 30 07:46:52 2015 UTC,"Not really. I think I mentioned in my OP that I hardly ever read fantasy.

discworld,30pkwo,frostblooded,6,Sun Mar 29 16:24:24 2015 UTC,"There are a few novels I wouldn't read out of sequence. Referring to the reading order chart you've linked:   Rincewind novels are fine in any order - his character doesn't develop too much, and he travels a lot so there's not much continuity in the settings to worry about. e: except as /u/HavelockAT points out below, Colour of Magic and The Light Fantastic. Witches novels: I would read these in order for preference, but they don't rely heavily on continuity so it's not that essential. You don't really need to read the series before going on to the Tiffany Aching ones, but I would recommend doing the Aching ones in order - the growth of the main character in that arc is very important. Ancient Civilisations - not really a continuity at all, read in any order. Death novels - read these in order except for Soul Music, Death isn't the focus of that book anyway.  Watch novels - of all the list, these are the most important to read in order, not only are the development of the characters important, later ones do spoil plot points of the earlier whodunnit ones. Under no circumstances read Night Watch without reading at least a couple of the Watch arc first. Industrial Revolution - like Ancient Civilisations, this is more of a miscellaneous catchall category. Read these in any order up until the Moist von Lipwig books."

discworld,30pkwo,TheGodBen,2,Sun Mar 29 16:47:30 2015 UTC,"Damn right it matters. You will miss half the jokes and some of the characters will really not work if you haven't seen them develop. Not to mention major spoilers. Everyone loves Vimes because we were right beside him when he rose from the gutters of Ankh to where he is now and I seriously doubt one can enjoy his books that much. If you are sure that you will read away, I would recommend publishing order. The problem with that aproach is that you might find the first two books a bit lack-luster. Not that they are bad, but they are bad compared with most of the others. If you want to get hooked, I'd recommend some of the books that have the least connection with the others and therefore you don't need any set-up to enjoy them. In this case Small Gods and The Amazing Mourice are the places to start."
discworld,30pkwo,dantemp,1 point,Mon Mar 30 14:21:54 2015 UTC,"When you say publishing order, if I start from book 3, won't it be strange to jump between series - third book - witches, fourth book - death, fifth book - rincewind. Also, would it be okay to read Sorcery if I haven't read the first two books?"
discworld,30pkwo,Poppamunz,2,Mon Mar 30 15:54:41 2015 UTC,"won't it be strange to jump between series - third book - witches, fourth book - death, fifth book - rincewind   I consider that an advantage of reading in publication order, it adds some variety to the series. For example, Rincewind is a largely comic character that would probably be insufferable if you read his novels in order, his novels work best as occasional comic treats between the more serious ones.  Besides, publication order is roughly chronological, and Disc society changes quite a bit over the course of 40 novels. If you were to read the Watch subseries in order, from Guards! Guards! up to Snuff, it would be strange to go back to the more traditional medieval fantasy settings of The Colour of Magic or Equal Rites."
discworld,30pkwo,fufluns12,2,Mon Mar 30 16:46:42 2015 UTC,"Jumping between series isn't a problem for me, it was actually refreshing. And it's cool when you see the actions from one character's story reflect in the world of another. As I said, if you are not going to go with the publishing order, you better start at small gods or Maurice. Their worlds are almost separate from the others, whereas the witches, the wizards and the watch cross each other's paths a lot. What you're asking is the worst option. If you don't like my other two propositions, start the watch storyline and stick with it."

It's not a bad book but it's not a great book either. You can see that his writing gets better as he goes along and looking back you can see that it's a lot rougher than some of the later books.   Personally I would start with Reaper man, small God's or pyramids. Your not too far in that there are lots of call backs you'd miss and the books are great"

If you want to sample the series first before making that sort of commitment, Guards! Guards! or Small Gods are good introductory novels, and you can go back to the beginning after them if you wish. If you don't want to commit to reading the entire series, which is a big ask to be fair, then just pick a subseries that sounds interesting to you and read that in order."

discworld,30mbwy,kallisti_gold,8,Sat Mar 28 18:19:46 2015 UTC,"It's satire that takes place in a fantasy setting. Rather like Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy but with dwarves and trolls and wizards.   It's not ""about"" any one thing(except making fun of culture) because each book in the series deals with different events or situations. Some stories deal with stuff happening at the Unseen University, the college where wizards go to eat large meals, drink lots of drinks, and occasionally study magic if they're not able to avoid it. Other books deal with The City Watch, and you get to spend a decade or so following the life and career of Samuel Vimes as he tries to keep the peace in a city where the Assassins Guild and Thieves Guild have more respect and higher social standing than the actual civic guard. Still Other stories feature the witches of the highlands, Granny Weatherwax, Nanny Ogg, and Magrat Garlick... Who are quite frankly singular and indescribable. And although the witches aren't my favorite characters on the Disc, they are my favorite stories  I wouldn't be in this sub if I didn't recommend the books wholeheartedly, so I can only advise that you read them.   But I will say that you shouldn't start with the first book. I would jump straight to Wyrd Sisters or Guards! Guards! The first two books are awkward and don't really fit with the rest of the series, and you might as well skip them and start with the first witches or City Watch book instead."

They are a little awkward I agree, but the base of the world and his writing style is there, its just a little rough around the edges. But I'm glad I did, you can slowly slip into the satirical fantasy world, if you are used to ASOIAF or Tolkien it can be a change to get into the Discworld universe. I knew I was in for keeps when in  maybe Small Gods? on the beginning of the universe, you hear a theory about the moment of creation coming from mating giant turtles...referred to as The Big Bang."
discworld,30mbwy,vonmonologue,2,Sun Mar 29 00:51:00 2015 UTC,"Absolutely go back and read them. I would read them when you start reading the stories focused on the Unseen University, because the first 2 books deal with the wizards primarily.

This annoys his granddaughter Susan, who wishes she was a normal human, but it means she gets along well with Time's son, Time, but unfortunately they dont get to spend much time together after killing the laws of physics. The laws of physics dont like people because humans dont make sense, so they try to kill Santa, who is sort of like a God. The gods dont really pay much attention to people lately though, unless they're making drawers stick or people are stopping believing in them, in which case they have to drop on someones head so they dont die. Not everyone approves of this sort of thing though, especially the leader witches dont have, Granny Weatherwax.

I'm a bit like OP in that I really prefer cohesion in style on my bookshelf, and unfortunately I have about four different styles of Discworld novels. I suppose that's the risk of collecting an author's novels while they're still releasing them."
discworld,30lmm0,ajgorak,3,Sun Mar 29 08:41:06 2015 UTC,"That's a good point, I don't actually know. I went to check the comments on The Discworld Emporium, but there was no mention of it. It would be a bit of a bad move by the publishers if people collected all the books in black covers only to find the final book didn't come in that style! Perhaps it might be worth sending a message to the Emporium or to the publishers about it.  I know the feeling, all mine are really different as well. I'd love to collect them all in one style if I had the money and space!"
discworld,30lmm0,HarlequinValentine,2,Sun Mar 29 08:59:47 2015 UTC,"Cool, thanks. I had to avoid the insanity of buying all the books in French when I found out about Marc Sominetti's cover art. I ended up just buying his art book instead of an entire series of books in a language I can't read.  At the moment I'm settling for owning all the physical books with their varied artwork while editing the cover images for all the Discworld novels on my Kindle so that at least THEY'RE uniform. There's always this niggling compulsion to update my series though."

It stars Rincewind the Wizard (voiced by Eric Idle) and is set on Terry Pratchett's Discworld. The game's plot is based roughly on the events in the book Guards! Guards!, but with Rincewind substituted for Sam Vimes. The game contains elements of Moving Pictures.   There are four other Discworld games: a direct sequel to Discworld, titled Discworld II: Missing Presumed...!? (Discworld II: Mortality Bytes! in North America), Discworld Noir (a stand alone story starring an original character), a text adventure called The Colour of Magic which strictly adheres to the events of the first Discworld novel and another game based on The Colour of Magic released on mobile phones titled Discworld: The Colour of Magic.  Discworld has been praised for its humour, voice-acting and graphics, though there have been criticisms concerning its gameplay and puzzles. Discworld has also been noted as being extremely challenging.

I suppose this is a reconciliation of the two losses to the world. The writing is pretty good and in tune with what I know of Discworld. I googled Joshua Ip and it appears that he is a Singaporean poet/writer. Another Discworld fan just like us.   There are certain references like the 7 days of mourning which Singapore is currently observing and it's pretty much in character with what I think we know of LKY and Lord Vetinari. There's also the bread by CMOT-Dibbler, where a popular local bread chain, Breadtalk came up with a LKY bread to commemorate him, with proceeds going to charity. But backlash was strong and they pulled the idea, apologised on their facebook and instead made a donation to the charity."

Though admittedly I do still have a framed picture of him that I drew when I was 12...  You mentioned about them needing to know the Librarian's real name - I'm sure this is because of the age-old magic principle that if you know someone's true name you have power over them. I forget if it is explained in the book, but I remember reading somewhere (possibly the Art of Discworld?) that the Librarian rather likes being an orangutan and prevents people finding out his true name in case they try to turn him back."

I would argue that it's more shallow than his depiction of China in Interesting Times.  Still, it's an OK book.

discworld,30hftk,matts2,8,Fri Mar 27 12:26:21 2015 UTC,"Agnes stayed on as the 3rd witch in Carpe Jugulum, but after that the structure of witching changed in the Ramtops.  Witching became a viable career and much more about seeing to one's stead rather than fighting big supernatural baddies or meddling with political affairs - which was strictly an area not usually delved into anyway.  The classic trio wasn't needed as much and fostering young witches was the primary job of every elder witch.  Twoflower and everything else was hit by the change spell at the beginning of Light Fantastic so that could easily be a spelling mistake.  Girls still didn't tend to become wizards - except for the girl who Rolund was sweet on in I Shall Wear Midnight (Letitia?) who had untrained wizard magic - because wizard magic isn't all too common in girls.  Escarina Smith still followed her research and Unseen University was totally shaken up shortly after during the events of Sourcery.  Given the trouble they went through in Equal Rights and Sourcery they doubled down on 'amiable stagnation' to protect the world (and themselves) until Ponder Stibbons started splitting the thaum and getting bits all over the place.  Vimes breaks his own rules all the time.  The important part is that he knows its wrong and doesn't try to justify it as anything other than 'what has to be done here and now' in order to protect the innocent, pursue evil doers, and seriously prod buttock.  He uses magic to pursue the dwarfs in Thud! and admits that 'he never uses magic' but 'sometimes he lies.'  he's not dumb enough to walk into a knife fight with a rubber chicken, he uses whatever is at hand to get the job done."

discworld,30hftk,tanajerner,3,Fri Mar 27 21:06:24 2015 UTC,"A quote from the annotated Pratchett bets sums up Terry's approach to consistency.   An interesting consideration is just when Lord Vetinari became Patrician. Clearly this isn't him (Vetinari eating crystallised jellyfish? -- I don't think so. Besides, Interesting Times makes it quite clear that Vetinari does not know who Rincewind is).  However, Terry has always denied this interpretation:  ""I'm pretty certain that the same Patrician was in all the books. [...] He's clearly lost weight and got more austere. It must be the pressure. As for racehorses and so on -- Vetinari is not the first Patrician, and no doubt the earlier ones, like Lord Snapcase, were often crazed, greedy and acquisitive. So he has inherited all sorts of things. But he doesn't change anything without a reason.""  When the people on afp were not immediately prepared to take his word for this (after all, what does he know -- he's only the author...), Terry conceded:  ""How about: maybe he was Vetinari, but written by a more stupid writer?"""
discworld,30hftk,madmoneymcgee,2,Sun Mar 29 23:22:08 2015 UTC,I think there aren't any inconsistencies as Pratchett didn't care about blocking himself into a corner so really its what you make of it

Using the reading guide that most have seen, have a poll for each of the starting series, then read the one that wins. The next month on that series is advanced by one for the new poll.   So, for the first month you have up for vote:  Colour of magic, Equal rites, Mort, Guards! Guards!  Then if Mort is chosen, the following month it's replaced in the vote by reaper man.   The books in the non main series can be introduced when appropriate.  In this way the early books can be left for a short while until people feel the need to do them, to get into the better books of each of the series."

He'd been following my posts and we'd talked about it a bunch, but the news about the code being passed between websites to honour him (""GNU Terry Pratchett"") is what finally got to him.  He's not very internet savvy, so he had no idea just how big of an influence STP has had on so many people. Hell, he assumed he was fairly unknown outside of Britain. I think the knowledge that so many people shared our grief over the shared joys for 30yrs is what made him tear up. As well as a number of his coworkers suddenly expressing their love of STP.  I'm still sad. No ""celebrity"" death has hit me this hard before, ever. My dad and I have shared so much through the Discworld novels, and my brother finally got into them a couple of years ago.

discworld,300r4z,juliet_echo_alpha,22,Mon Mar 23 15:35:26 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm so, so sorry that you accidentally talked about religion. You're gonna get knee-jerk hate for that.  It's true that there are sermons meant to help give you a moral compass, or at least some guidance.  In a strangely nihilistic way, Pterry's books are an excellent moral compass indeed. Because there's no such thing as justice or fairness or right or wrong in the universe -- but there is such a thing in us, as humans, if we so choose. In that way, we are the most important thing to each other, because we choose, with our actions, what we want the world to become.  There's Night Watch.    They did the job they didn't have to do and they died doing it   There's Hogfather.   Death: No. Humans need fantasy to be human. To be the place where the falling angel meets the rising ape.   Susan: With tooth fairies? Hogfathers?  Death: Yes. As practice, you have to start out learning to believe the little lies.  Susan: So we can believe the big ones?  Death: Yes. Justice, mercy, duty. That sort of thing.  Susan: They're not the same at all!  Death: You think so? Then take the universe and grind it down to the finest powder and sieve  it through the finest sieve and THEN show me one atom of justice, one molecule of mercy. And yet... you try to act as if there is some ideal order in the world. As if there is some... some rightness in the universe by which it may be judged.  Susan: But people have got to believe that, or what's the point?  Death: You need to believe in things that aren't true. How else can they become?"
discworld,300r4z,Trevoke,11,Mon Mar 23 18:05:54 2015 UTC,"That's quite all right. My own personal search for truth and meaning has been colored greatly by the Discworld books, rather than the church upbringing some folks had. I didn't mean to imply that I'm religious, just that the moral ideas put forth in these novels are some of the most thought-provoking I've ever encountered in fantasy. Your contributions are exactly what I was looking for. Thank you."

discworld,300r4z,InfantStomper,26,Thu Apr 2 13:20:34 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure that comparing Pterry's books to religious ones is the best way to go about it. Personally I did grow up with religious teaching, yet I don't think the messages found in Discworld were in any way dampened by that fact. I've always found that Sir Terry's writing supported or supplemented my faith rather than clashing against it. One of my favorite Discworld books is Small Gods due to how perfectly he illustrates how manipulative people can control and oppress a huge number of people through the guise of religion. It shows the difference in faith vs brainwashing, and how so much of organised religion can become thoughtless traditions and ritual for the sake of ritual. The most poignant detail to me was that Om traveled across the disc and would have seen thousands who were being willingly oppressed by the church, all in the name of Om. Yet not a single one conscientiously thought of him or actually believed in him, just in the structure and rituals of the church. Pyramids tackles the same thing, and (to me) succeeds excellently in doing so.    Of course that isn't to say your question is in any way less valid, and I now realize I haven't really answered it!    My favorite moral message in the series would have to come from Granny Weatherwax speaking about the nature of sin in Carpe Jugulum:     ""Sixteen!"" ""You've counted sixteen?"" said Oats eventually. ""No, but it is as good an answer as any you'll get. And that's what you holy men discuss is it?"" ""Not usually. There is a very interesting debate raging at the moment on the nature of sin, for example."" ""And what do they think? Against it, are they?"" ""It is not as simple as that. It's not a black and white issue. There are so many shades of gray."" ""Nope."" ""Pardon?"" There's no grays, only white that's got grubby. I'm surprised you don't know that. And sin, young man, is when you treat people as things. Including yourself. That's what sin is."" ""It's a lot more complicated than that--"" ""No it ain't. When people say things are a lot more complicated than that, they means they're getting worried that they won't like the truth. People as things, that's where it starts."" ""Oh, I'm sure there are worse crimes-"" ""But they starts with thinking about people as things…"""
discworld,300r4z,shaolingod,12,Mon Mar 23 16:56:33 2015 UTC,"Granny Weatherwax, no bullshit there."
discworld,300r4z,yoat,7,Mon Mar 23 18:57:17 2015 UTC,"Every race on the Discworld is just a stand-in for people on the Roundworld. It's not a 1-to-1 mapping or anything (even if it seems like it is, it isn't).  The point being that a lot of his books are one group of people treating another group of people like they aren't people. Raising Steam and Snuff both focused heavily on the Goblins, one of the lowest of the lower class races of the Disc, for example.  Any of these books (almost all of them, when you get down to it) can be mined for specific references to how one group mistreats another.   I don't view Sir Pratchett as having had all the answers, he was just exquisitely good at demonstrating what some of the wrong answers have been. I'd recommend you not try to take him more seriously than he took himself."
discworld,300r4z,saltwatermonkey,5,Mon Mar 23 18:10:51 2015 UTC,"I think this was possibly the reason I was so sad when he died. It was like losing a great teacher. I'm not religious either, but I know what you mean. There is a line or a speech somewhere in one of the witches books, I think a Tiff one, about doing the job that's in front of you. That struck home for me. I'm always thinking ahead and wondering how I can do the most good with my life, and I often forget the here and now. Doing the job that's in front of you may not be glamorous, but it's a damn sight more useful than sitting on my arse fretting about how to be a good person. To be honest, a lot of my feelings and thoughts on morality and how to be a decent person have been echoed and influenced by the witches and Sam Vines. I reread those books more often than the others because whenever I do it reminds me to try to be a better person."
discworld,300r4z,tardmancer,3,Mon Mar 23 19:01:46 2015 UTC,"I would like to throw in my two cents on fantasy and morality, whilst also adding sci-fi content to the mix. I apologise if it is somewhat incoherent, I've never really put it into words before.  I feel that fantasy and sci-fi can be used to teach moral lessons easily and understandably, without demonising anyone or attaching blame to any non-fictional person. They can sometimes be used as a kind of parable for such things, which is one of the best teaching aides I can think of for this purpose.  Also, I feel that fantasy and sci-fi can be used to explore more tangible social or personal issues and in fact often does in an incredibly insightful way. It can be used to explore some incredibly complex epistemological and ontological issues as well. I had examples for this and will edit them in later if I can remember them.   Go ahead and post a few as replies to this if you like, I find this whole idea pretty damn interesting. Or ignore it, whatever you want. Again, I think this could be phrased better, but this'll have to do for now."
discworld,300r4z,shaolingod,2,Mon Mar 23 18:45:56 2015 UTC,"When I read a discworld novel, be it for the first time or the umpteenth, I go from crying to laughing to contemplating. I'm sorry I can't help with specifics but I want you to know I feel the same. Perhaps not my only compass but Pratchett is full of wisdom. I do remeber one thing because my wife just bought some diet noodles with basically NO calories. Famine from Good Omens, proud of making food that you will starve from eating. True in so many ways. Just look at what some/most people are eating.. They may get fat but they are not getting the nutrients they need."
discworld,300r4z,kanooka,2,Mon Mar 23 18:56:36 2015 UTC,"I find it interesting - I grew up with religion, but it was Unitarian Universalist religion. A lot of the books from discworld (in my personal experience and opinion) espouse ideas and beliefs that I have.    One quote that has always stuck with me (and forgive me if the words aren't quite right, I copied this off of goodreads.com) is ""“What have I always believed? That on the whole, and by and large, if a man lived properly, not according to what any priests said, but according to what seemed decent and honest inside, then it would, at the end, more or less, turn out all right.” "" from Small Gods."
discworld,300r4z,ssaminds,-7,Tue Mar 24 00:10:23 2015 UTC,"hm. I think comparing Sir Terry to religion and church sermons is dead wrong. and I have to state that moral, right and wrong and morality is an issue of philosophy and thinking. but not of faith. I'm telling you this hence on the one hand I am a (scientific) philosopher and on the other hand STP clearly made a statement against religion and the way religion treats people and truth. I hold him to have described or pictured some of the basic moral truth very well so that you think it's as simple as that even though it's not. there are many quotes I could give here. sorry if I tell you that I'm not the kind of guy doing work for you ..."
discworld,300r4z,Wireless-Wizard,6,Mon Mar 23 16:19:30 2015 UTC,"At no point does any discworld book argue against religion as a whole, or religion in and of itself.  There are plenty of harangues against corruption within religion, and people misusing religion for their own ends, but look at Monstrous Regiment for example - the church of Nuggan is basically everything wrong with organised religion, but the Duchess and her prophet, Wazzer, are in no way a ""clear statement against religion""."

discworld,2zzeha,masklinn,8,Mon Mar 23 10:20:47 2015 UTC,"You started well.  Like Jottor says, go with publication order.  You get all of the backstories of characters that are introduced fully-formed later on, so when you encounter a familiar face, you already know what their story is.  The Colour Of Magic is the worst Discworld story.  That's not a condemnation of it!  It just means that things get better and better."
discworld,2zzeha,petrosh,3,Mon Mar 23 13:09:50 2015 UTC,"If you liked Colour of Magic this much, keep going in publication order. They get much, much better."
discworld,2zzeha,ThatIckyGuy,2,Mon Mar 23 18:35:37 2015 UTC,I'm on mobile so I don't have a link handy for you. But in general you can either go chronologically. Or by series.  If you want to do the latter I recommend looking up the suggested reading order on the lspace wiki. I recommend readings chronologically though. Unless you have something against having a different main character every book.
discworld,2zzeha,Arch27,2,Mon Mar 23 10:48:33 2015 UTC,"Some people use the publication order (I do, because that's how I read them since I was a wee kiddy), others use the reading order guides, yet others just pick books at random.  With the latter you can miss background information on characters when they're part of (loose) storylines, but generally speaking it still works."

discworld,2zzeha,onehoopyfrood,7,Mon Mar 23 14:17:08 2015 UTC,"I'd suggest publication order. You'll watch the writing evolve, and there are quite a few callbacks (cameos, slight references) in subsequent novels.  I'm not too far ahead of you (haven't started book #7 yet). Kind of got sidetracked with another author's book trilogy for a bit, and a friend of mine also just published his first, but when I'm done with those I'll hop on Pyramids and keep going."

discworld,3005vc,pratchettjob,10,Mon Mar 23 12:13:35 2015 UTC,Yeah I felt the same way. From this book onwards I've always felt a distinct decline in quality. I know that at some point Terry's Alzheimer's interfered with his writing process and he had to dictate his books. But I'm not sure when it started.
discworld,3005vc,plastikmissile,3,Mon Mar 23 16:35:59 2015 UTC,"That's a shame. This novel was pre-embuggerance so I am not sure whether/if we could blame that. It does pick up from Thud!, which had a lot of the same bad habits, although it was a much more enjoyable book - it at least examined the themes it raised."
discworld,3005vc,plastikmissile,3,Mon Mar 23 16:43:09 2015 UTC,"It's still an interesting book, but it lacks the ""cleverness"" of the stellar ""Going Postal"" I always thought."
discworld,3005vc,OutofH2G2references,1 point,Mon Mar 23 18:47:46 2015 UTC,"From Wikipedia.   In August 2007, Pratchett was misdiagnosed as having had a minor stroke in 2004 or 2005, which doctors believed had damaged the right side of his brain. While his motor skills were affected, the observed damage had not impaired his ability to write. On 11 December 2007, Pratchett posted online that he had been newly diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's disease, which had been responsible for the ""stroke"". He had a rare form of the disease, posterior cortical atrophy (PCA), in which areas at the back of the brain begin to shrink and shrivel.   Making Money was published in 2007. So, it lines up pretty spot on."
discworld,3005vc,BlastedFemur,6,Tue Mar 24 04:14:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it was a bit of a letdown after Going Postal, and the fact that it is in some respects a retread of Moist's first outing makes the drop in quality even more glaring. The villains were OK but I wasn't particularly interested in Mr Bent and the bit about him being a clown fell very flat for me.  I did like the bit at the start where Moist was robbing his own building for a thrill, felt like a natural progression of his character (Discworld characters are often a bit static across novels, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it's cool to see some development). I remember Adora Belle still being a pretty good character in this one as well (seriously, what happened to her in Raising Steam?) and I enjoyed the latest addition to the Unseen University faculty, Dr Hix the necromancer, though he's not as good as the rest of them. Still don't like what happens with Vetinari in the later books.  I think a big problem with the book is that it's really a mess of subplots that never really come together in a satisfying way. I'm thinking over it now and I'm getting confused just trying to piece the story together, though it has admittedly been a few years since I read it.  I thought the subplot about a shady figure from Moist's past coming back to haunt him had a lot of potential but it was sadly wasted. The whole thing with the golems felt a bit out of place.  All that said, it's not dreadful by any means and has a few things going for it."

Some people suggest coming back to Colour of Magic/Light Fantastic (The story from Colour of Magic vontinues in to Light Fantastic, its the only onrs that cant be read as standalone stories) after Mort and a few others as it is noticable that Terry was still trying to set up the writing style for Discworld in those first 2 books.

Colour of Magic was the first book in the series; ""the rules"" weren't completely fleshed out yet. (Even Death was actually /malicious/, and not the kindhearted, but fair, character we know him as today).  I would imagine that at this point, Pratchett wasn't planning on writing dozens and dozens of books in the same coherent universe, he simply wanted to write a comedy/fantasy story.  A lot of people treat Colour of Magic/Light Fantastic as ""non-canonical"", as in, you should basically skip right over them.   The world of the Discworld didn't have its ""legs"" yet; it was a bit raw and still cooking. The Creator (ie, Pratchett) is playing fast and loose with the universe, to ""see what sticks""."

discworld,2zvkm7,4CatDoc,4,Sun Mar 22 21:06:10 2015 UTC,Like your edit :D I was about to suggest Tiffany AChing and her frying pan. How about something based off both your first and favourite Pratchett book?
discworld,2zvkm7,ShakingHandsWithDeat,3,Sun Mar 22 05:56:45 2015 UTC,"How about:   -A sprig of Lilac on your chest?  -The coat of arms of your favorite Guild  See here: http://www.us.lspace.org/books/apf/the-discworld-companion.html  -City Watch Badge on your chest  -Death (Death or Rats).  -Hogfather.  -->Seriously, whatever character(s) most inspired you.  http://www.us.lspace.org/books/apf/the-discworld-companion.html  Commet: Feegle:luggage is a few inches:almost 3 feet tall.

discworld,2zw398,rindrel,7,Sun Mar 22 09:35:30 2015 UTC,The Blackboard Monitor honorific comes from the Fifth Elephant and came about when Vimes was about to meet the Low King of the Dwarfs. He mentions it as a joke but it's actually a big deal for the more zealous Dwarfs as they think destroying words is a pretty heinous crime.   The scar comes from Thud! and Vimes carrying an ancient evil called The Summoning Dark. It left a scar on Vimes and the Dwarfs are terrified of it and Vimes for carrying it.
discworld,2zw398,Tempscire1986,5,Sun Mar 22 11:29:09 2015 UTC,"Blackboard Monitor...dwarves respect education, writing etc. Vimes was blackboard monitor ie he was in charge of erasing/not erasing  words.   When he was presented to the King of the Dwarves in The Fith Elephant every honour he had -His Grace, His Excellency, His Blackboard-Monitorship, The Duke of Ankh, Commander Sir Samuel Vimes of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch, Lord of the Ramkin Estates- was asked for and he mentioned, sarcastically, that he was blackboard monitor. This was included in the introduction .  The King was quite aware of the sarcasm behind it.  As an aside the Lspace wiki is a great help for everything Discworld/Pratchett.  http://wiki.lspace.org/mediawiki/Main_Page"
discworld,2zw398,jonakajon,3,Sun Mar 22 11:23:20 2015 UTC,"Well, re-read the Watch books because they're some of my favorites. Particularly Thud! and The Fifth Elephant.   And Tiffany Aching on the whole is better than Maurice.  ANYWAY,   Vimes was a blackboard monitor as a school boy. He mentions as a joke in the Fifth Elephant but it turns out that it was a big deal to the dwarves. So its stuck with him and the fact that he managed to survive is a big deal to dwarves as well.   The summoning dark is a curse that is put upon him in Thud! He gets over it (otherwise it would've killed him) but the scar is there as a reminder."
discworld,2zw398,madmoneymcgee,1 point,Sun Mar 22 21:53:05 2015 UTC,Actually he more than gets over it- the Curse/demon whatever and him achieve a sort of mutual respect/alliance and the curse actually helps him quite a bit in the later books. IE night vision and the ability to communicate with pretty much any of the cave-dwelling ethnicities.

discworld,2zplvr,OriginalStomper,7,Fri Mar 20 20:03:17 2015 UTC,"Above all else, this is why I loved Pratchett; he made me laugh out loud when reading his books, something that happens so rarely reading other books. It's amazing how much that simple act can convince someone to pick up the same book, just because they saw a physical response from you.  Pratchetts humour shaped my own over the last 20yrs, and I'll always love him for that. As well as everything else he taught me through his writing, he showed me humour. I love to laugh, and for that I love him."
discworld,2zplvr,TheBrownWelsh,6,Fri Mar 20 20:32:47 2015 UTC,"This is my favourite of the eulogy articles I've read so far.  We came for Pratchett's humour, we stayed for his insights and philosophy."
discworld,2zplvr,Minky_Dave_the_Giant,5,Fri Mar 20 22:06:22 2015 UTC,"Probably one of the better stories I read about him recently. I must say those I appreciated his humor, but I think that he interlaced it with those more serious topics is what keeps me coming back to them."
discworld,2zplvr,jabari74,3,Fri Mar 20 20:53:48 2015 UTC,"Pratchett was genuinely, reliably funny. Even his less funny books were funny. We should add him to that infamous list – pizza, sex and Terry Pratchett. Even when they’re bad, they’re still pretty damn good.   The truth.   Also, everyone needs to go become a devoted fan of Nick Harkaway."
discworld,2zplvr,madmoneymcgee,2,Fri Mar 20 21:36:26 2015 UTC,"FWIW, Nick Harkaway (author of the article) is a gifted (and often funny) writer in his own, er, right. His 2008 novel Gone-Away World is simply terrific (thought not, as might otherwise seem implied, at all of a style like Pratchett's stuff)."
discworld,2zplvr,AlwaysSayHi,2,Fri Mar 20 21:08:39 2015 UTC,I'm a huge fan of Harkaway. And even though I'd rank Gone Away World as my least favorite (Angelmaker is #1) it still made me burst out laughing in the middle of a crowded train.

discworld,2zs9ow,Tiffany_Aching,3,Sat Mar 21 14:14:13 2015 UTC,"Before I go read what you wrote, just to address the bit about feeling like a spammer: Technically, the rule on reddit is that you can post your own stuff 10% of the time, and contribute stuff from other sources 90% of the time. That 10% is an upper bound.  However, the admins somewhat recently also fuzzed that up a bit, saying that the nature of the content would be taken into account. While they've still not cleared content creators from posting their own content, they seemingly have acknowledged that original content gets posted to reddit, and it's not all about profits.  All that to say that the less you're making money from what you submit, the more the community wants the content posted, the less likely the admins would intervene. And also, if nobody reports anything to them, they won't know - they're too busy. (I'd report bad behaviour, but this is what we want in here - it's good behaviour).  So please don't feel like a spammer in the slightest. Even without reading what you wrote, I want to encourage you and everyone else like you to contribute to the subreddit.

discworld,2zroas,Dee_Buttersnaps,3,Sat Mar 21 21:32:10 2015 UTC,I started reading Pratchett this year and Guards! Guards! Was a great starting place
discworld,2zroas,Rob25736,1 point,Sat Mar 21 22:40:42 2015 UTC,"I recommend Guards Guards every time - the detective/cop genre crossed with fantasy is a comfortable place for many to recognise the tropes and get comfortable with the humour. Plus this then leads comfortably to the entire Watch sequence, which can live on its own but does cross with some other stories down the line that can be used to explore."
discworld,2zroas,Faldoras,2,Sun Mar 22 22:48:22 2015 UTC,"I'm a big fan of starting people off with Small Gods.  Although if the heretics are familiar with Shakespeare, Wyrd Sisters is fun and unexpected."

discworld,2zroas,CaptnYossarian,2,Sun Mar 22 01:43:20 2015 UTC,"because the ""rules of the discworld"" hadn't been properly established yet. The Colour of Magic and The Light Fantastic are pretty much considered non-canonical, because it is so different from the rest of the series. (I did start with them though. No regrets)"
discworld,2zroas,Rob25736,1 point,Sun Mar 22 20:44:52 2015 UTC,Oh I see. Well thank you for that bit of info. I'm really enjoying the color of magic. Its very different from any other fantasy I've read and I've read a lot. Hope the style doesn't change to much.
discworld,2zroas,CaptnYossarian,2,Sun Mar 22 21:33:45 2015 UTC,"The style doesn't change drastically, but the world settles into a set of more consistent rules in later books, and it's a little more prosaic, but it is more than made up for in the creativity of the stories."

discworld,2zos0d,iforgotagain42,21,Fri Mar 20 13:30:10 2015 UTC,"This book is very good but took me completely by surprise. I thought Pratchett doing war would be angry and dark and complex. Instead, what we get is an absolute riot of a book. I defy anyone not to be amused by Vetinari, Nobby and Colon's Some Like It Hot routine.  It's a shame the Vimes vs Vimes subplot was not developed as much as it could have been but the jokes make up for the lack of examination about war itself.  Thanks, as always, for clicks and karma."

discworld,2zos0d,darthboolean,4,Fri Mar 20 13:56:33 2015 UTC,Angry and dark (and maybe complex) is totally something Sourcery already did.  :D
discworld,2zos0d,OriginalStomper,1 point,Fri Mar 20 14:14:36 2015 UTC,"I thought it made sense that Vimes vs Vimes hardly happened.  It was like the whole conflict its self.  Misdirection disguised as bad misdirection.  ""We're not so different, you and I."" was so expected you could almost hear it ahead of time.  But then it turns out they aren't so different in the sense that they're both AM boys but they actually are utter opposites.  Ahmed schemes and plans, kills with little hesitation and is from the upper crust. Vimes reacts and tries to do the job thats in front of him, doesn't kill (on purpose - werewolves don't count) and is common as muck.  Just like how the 'good' prince turns out to be a scheming bastard and the 'evil' prince was a good-natured guy."
discworld,2zos0d,Shalmanese,13,Fri Mar 20 17:28:38 2015 UTC,"I liked it, and Jingo definitely stands as one of my favorite books, but I think that the novel was better served by the build up to the war, rather than the fighting itself. Vimes and the group are cops, not soldiers. Vimes says it himself after he forms the regiment, he's considering it more of a pursuit of a fugitive and a continuation of his investigation.   For the war theme, I'd say Monstrous Regiment did a perfect job of taking what jingo started with and running with it.  But still good article, and I look forward to more :)"
discworld,2zos0d,Pitchwife,2,Fri Mar 20 15:50:16 2015 UTC,"I think that the novel was better served by the build up to the war, rather than the fighting itself.    That's a great distinction.  Jingo is about how wars start (or don't).  Jingo is not about how wars are conducted or ended."
discworld,2zos0d,Shalmanese,8,Sat Mar 21 21:29:31 2015 UTC,"The author mentions Northern Ireland and Yugoslavia but somehow fails to draw the connection to the Falklands War which is the most obvious inspiration that Pratchett draws on.  Also, it may be funny but the scene with the disorganizer reeling off the deaths is the most chilling paragraph I've ever read from a Pratchett book."
discworld,2zos0d,mogarthedestructoid,3,Fri Mar 20 14:38:04 2015 UTC,"What makes you say The Falklands, out of interest? I used the other two as they were the closest examples of conflict to the book's publication.  Totally agree with you about the disorganiser scene - it is dark as."

Standing at 800 feet and with 8,888 steps from the bottom to the top, it is part of the Unseen University in Ankh-Morpork. It is completely without windows and, due to several repairs over the centuries, it has a gnarled appearance, much like an ancient yew tree. Atop it sit several small turrets and crenellations and within its stones entire ecosystems have formed, including species unique to the Tower of Art. A lack of predators willing to climb the vast heights of the tower has meant that several species of insects, birds and small mammals have been able to evolve fairly unaffected by the outside world, except by the magical waste from the university, causing some very odd results in the evolutionary pathways of these animals.

That means the ultimate outcome is arguably not much different -- though perhaps less bitterness from young Vimes if Keel's death were not staged to be as ugly and unfair.  Suppose, though, that the death of his hero is a substantial reason young Vimes turned to alcohol and became a drunk.  Given the hero-worship, and the scenes in the graveyard, it is clear Keel's death had a substantial impact in Vimes and may have been formative.  If Keel's death were more heroic, or if Keel simply rode off into the sunset, then Vimes would likely have become a different person.  That would defeat the monks' goal.  They couldn't let Keel's departure be anything other than a bitter, bitter death."
discworld,2zlbh4,OriginalStomper,3,Thu Mar 19 17:06:51 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that in the timeline that our Vimes remembers from his youth, Keel died on the barricade, not in a streetfight with Patrician-ordered thugs afterwards. You'd think it would have made the rest of the people who wear the lilac - Nobby and Colon, particularly - much more bitter about authority figures rather than Vimes, who remembers how the original Keel died. They just remember the events of Night Watch."

If he strikes the bell by accident, the knights will awaken. If they do, they will ask, ""Is it time?"" and he must say, ""No, sleep on"". Of course, he forgets the words on his second visit and he is badly beaten and thrown from the cavern, whereupon the portal closes, never to be seen again.

Second of all you don't get to decide how I chose to honor Sir Terry Pratchett.   Third of all if I don't read the book Discworld will never end for me. If I read it, that's it. No more new stories from my favourite fictional world. If I don't read it the possibilities are endless. Tiffany might take the wee free men to the moon to conquer the space lions as their mounts, or she might meet Moist von Lipwig to start a college for young witches. I chose to speculate, I chose not to end the Discworld saga. Sure, I will fail in the end and read it, but for a long time the stories will live on in the realm of 'what-ifs'."

PCA progresses entirely differently than regular Alzheimer's. The memory loss people associate with traditional Alzheimer's is a very late stage effect of PCA.  Nothing that I've seen mentioned about him in the past year seems to indicate that his PCA had progressed enough to have a measurable effect on his memory or cognition."

This is even more apparent in the way that people have used his quotes and expressed their emotions toward Sir Pratchett's death via the words of Death. He gave us a vocabulary to talk about and cope with death in a way no other person possibly could."
discworld,2z973k,OutofH2G2references,1 point,Tue Mar 17 02:32:27 2015 UTC,Absolutely. And I also think it came through in his campaigning for assisted suicide.

discworld,2z8r3p,nolo_me,3,Tue Mar 17 07:19:00 2015 UTC,"The account is based on the character of Death, from the Discworld series by Terry Pratchett. Death appears in pretty much every book, sometimes as a cameo, sometimes as a main character. Death always speaks IN ALL CAPS, and is one of the most popular characters in the series. He looks like the traditional representation of The Grim Reaper (a skeleton in a black robe, who used a scythe to separate the soul from the body at the time of death), and everyone has an Hourglass, which represents the time of their life. Because of his work, he is one of the loneliest characters in the universe, doing a job that is necessary, but hardly loved. Over the millennia of interacting with humans he has developed an interest in them, and this interest has often resulted in him getting a bit too involved with humanity - for example, he takes on a human apprentice at one point, and almost gives up the mantle of being Death in order to become part of the human world, until he realises that he is far too needed in his job, as a human would never be able to do it as well.  Death is a humanist, but he is also quite fatalistic. A line he often says is, THERE IS NO JUSTICE. THERE IS ONLY ME. In response to characters trying to plead with him to make exceptions. Death cannot upset the natural order of things and grant more life (although the gods can, and on a couple of occasions he does intervene with the gods to grant someone more life). However, there are a few loopholes - for example, it is allowable to challenge him to a game (traditionally chess, which he hates, because he can never remember how the Knight moves), although Death rarely loses, but he is happy to in some situations - for example, in one story, he is challenged to a game of Poker to decide whether he will take the life of a sick infant, or a sick cow, and it is obvious that he is happy to take the cow instead when he loses.  So basically, this is a pitch-perfect pastiche of how the character of Death would respond to a petition to bring Pratchett back from the dead. The ""quantum"" joke at the end is a running joke throughout the series; it's often used to talk about complex physical and metaphysical ideas, but no one in the Discworld really knows what quantum means!"

I chatted with her for a while about what a shock it was, how lovely he died with his cat on his bed, how sad the tweets were. I went to the pub after work, and was eating my curry sat opposite the TV. All my friends were happy and talkative, all I could think of was Terry, as the news came on and all they showed for an hour straight were interviews about him, and clips from his euthanasia documentary. I got home, and my housemates all turned to me, asked if I knew. None of them wanted to text me while I was at work, incase I got upset. It wasnt until I went to my room and posted the obligitary facebook update with the picture I have of me and Terry that I just broke down."

The book’s description of Lord Vetinari’s clock inspired me to write this simulator.  Going Postal also describes the clock, but I haven’t yet implemented everything it describes:   The clock in Lord Vetinari’s anteroom didn’t tick right. Sometimes the tick was just a fraction late, sometimes the tock was early. Occasionally, one or the other didn’t happen at all. This wasn’t really noticeable until you’d been in there for five minutes, by which time small but significant parts of the brain were going crazy.   – Going Postal by Terry Pratchett, page 321  My project’s README mentions similar works, including a physical Vetinari clock that was once discussed on Reddit."

Although that's very sad, I'm personally glad that no-one is carrying on the books. Sir Terry was one of a kind, and I wouldn't want to read something written by someone else, no matter how much of a good attempt it was.  We will have some spin-offs, though. The Discworld Emporium guys told me they were working on an atlas a while back (Sir Terry actually rang them up when we were in the shop and asked how far they thought it was to Twoshirts!). I wouldn't be surprised if we see news of that soon.   They mentioned a bunch of TV/film adaptations in the works at the Discworld Con. Possible movies of Amazing Maurice and Wee Free Men, possible TV series of The Watch and Good Omens. Though to borrow a quote from the man himself: ""The difference between me and Neil in our attitude to movie projects is that he doesn't believe they're going to happen until he's sitting in his seat eating popcorn, and I don't believe they're going to happen."""

Now because of that production we were invited to go down to the Australian Disc world Convention to present a play. Now Ian Rennie / Renoir who was our director for the new play we were showing decided to adapt “Nanny Ogg’s Cookbook” for the stage. Now Terry Pratchett was in attendance and absolutely loved it and told the director that he is allowed to adapt more of his books.   Now this is a recording (actually two recordings on different nights) of the next book he adapted which was “The Last Hero” the play itself had a month long run and was pretty well received. it is a long play though so I have broken it up into chunks (that and Australian Internet speeds are horrid at the best of times)   if people have any questions feel free to ask I am more than happy to answer what I can, and this has been uploaded with the permission of the director who has the authority to release this for public consumption.

He created a wondrous, silly world for peoples imaginations to run free. And he truly loved a good story.  Sir Terry had once said ""You can't build a plot out of jokes. You need tragic relief."" And this is true in his writings. We saw Sam Vimes relive the most tragic day in his past during the Treacle Street Rebellion, We saw Tiffany Aching cry for the first time over her grandmothers death and we saw the glorious end of The Silver Horde.  Do you remember Soul Music? In the beginning, Mort and Ysabell died in a carriage wreck. Two characters we had grown to love from an earlier book, passed on with barely a word. Death had offered them the chance to continue living in his realm but they declined. For them, that would not be a real life.   Sir Terry knew Death was coming for him and welcomed Death into his home. Not as something to be feared, but as an old friend who had waited patiently for the right time.   I cried when he passed on. And I think Sir Terry would have been OK with his fans crying. He meant so much to so many people that it only makes sense. But he also would have wanted us to move along with our lives and become better people.   But the world is no less dull with him gone. He wrote dozens of books, each worthy of being read again and again. Grieve for him and never forget. But also never forget to be the kind of person that Sir Terry Pratchett would want you to be."
discworld,2z2uti,BW_Bird,2,Sun Mar 15 05:17:26 2015 UTC,I picked up Mort to read about a week before he died since I've heard so much about him but have never read his books. Didn't get around to reading it until last night. Decided to jump in. It was the first time I've picked up a book and didn't put it down until I read it. This is unusual because most books do not do this for me. Immediately afterwards I bought Reaper Man and got over halfway through before I decided I should really sleep at some point.  So far I am loving it!

And I would not do so even if I knew how. It belongs to you. Only time and tears take away grief; that is what they are for.”    I'm there with you. I've never really understood when people react emotionally to the death of a celebrity, but this feels like losing a member of my family. I read my first Discworld book 26 years ago; his works have been a meaningful part of my life for a long time.  It may seem strange to say this about comedic fantasy books that take place in a world situated on the back of a giant turtle (though probably not so strange to anyone in this subreddit), but his books present the most sane perspective on the world I have ever encountered. He taught me that it's possible to be keenly aware of all that is wrong with the world while still maintaining a sense of humor and joy about life.   I will miss him terribly. But his words and ideas will live on, and I'm comforted to know that a visit to the Discworld is only as far away as my bookshelf."

His critique of almost everything showed me the flaws were not necessarily in me, but in the world itself, and that said flaws weren't the be all and end all, that I'm more important to a few select people than I realised. He gave me an escape, but in a way lead me back to reality smarter, more understanding and more savvy to the world. He was so much more than an author, and I cried like I'd lost a grandfather, or a best friend."
discworld,2z2uti,illgetmecoat,7,Sun Mar 15 09:32:36 2015 UTC,"I'm terrible at coping with loss anyway. Everytime I come to this subreddit I bawl my eyes out again. For at least 23 years I feel like he's been part of my life, although I never even met him. His books were always a consolation and full of role models. And Discworld feels like a second home. I read them again and again and listen to one of the audiobooks almost every night. Right now, I feel like switching to somethng else though, to not be reminded for a while. But everything else just seems so pale in comparsion ..."

He helped me to see myself, as well as other people; in a more forgiving light. He saw our idiocy and mocked, but that mocking contained so much humanity, humor and warmth. Rest in Peace, Sir Terry Pratchett!"

Whenever I recommend his work to someone I segue into the fact that not only was he knighted for services to literature, he took it upon himself to forge his own sword, from scratch, with fucking space metal.  Even if they don't end up reading his books, it never fails to impress and, I like to imagine, it eats away at them bit by bit every time they're reminded of it until they finally relent and grab a book of his."

discworld,2z12m7,Faldoras,8,Sat Mar 14 20:42:40 2015 UTC,"Most likely just a coincidence. There's a trope called Thunderbolt Iron which probably inspired the use of using meteorites in forging a sword, as Sir Terry himself said: ""several pieces of meteorites - thunderbolt iron, you see - highly magical, you've got to chuck that stuff in whether you believe in it or not."""

I was living in Japan at the time and there was a bit of a lending library among the expats in my town. I was about to take a week or two traveling by train, so I grabbed it and some other book that I don't remember to read while I traveled.

discworld,2z2amj,JamJarre,3,Mon Mar 16 21:06:58 2015 UTC,"The Colour Of Magic. Yes I started the series with the very first book way back in the 1980s. Found it at the local library and just kept reading the new ones as they were published.  Started buying the paperbacks soon after and years later listening to the audio books.  Since you brought up Reaper Man, I reread it years later and to my surprise it had a ""different"" ending than my memory thinks it should have been. I had thought it was dark and gloomy but years later found it uplifting and a better read than the first go round. Funny how memory plays tricks like that. I wonder how many other books I don't recall correctly?"
discworld,2z2amj,Love_To_Burn_30721,4,Sat Mar 14 22:40:51 2015 UTC,I know exactly what you mean. I have re-read some of his books and I swear their endings are different sometimes. I think Terry was right and they have a life of their own... I'm sure I heard and 'Ook' once as well :)
discworld,2z2amj,FlakJackson,5,Sat Mar 14 22:45:37 2015 UTC,"During my college years I heard enough about Discworld to know that I'd love it, so once I got a job and had money to throw around I went into Borders and started hunting. I didn't realize there was any particular order, so I just grabbed the one that interested me the most, which ended up being Night Watch.  I fell in love with Vimes instantly and finished it that night. I went back the next day to get Guards! Guards! and Men at Arms (having noticed that Night Watch had some previously established context I was missing, I did my research on the reading orders) and continued to buy and read two/paycheck for quite some time. Monetary obligations eventually stopped me from finishing my collection at such haste, but I'm slowly getting there.  Night Watch is probably still my favorite, but there's some definite contention for the title now."
discworld,2z2amj,thefeistytaco,7,Sat Mar 14 22:45:36 2015 UTC,Reaper Man was my first but it only holds the number two slot on my favourites list.  I totally agree with you on Night Watch. The Vimes series is amazing from start to finish but Night Watch is probably my all time favourite book. I can't even estimate how many times I have read it.
discworld,2z2amj,ClownBaby86,5,Sat Mar 14 22:48:57 2015 UTC,Night watch is still my favorite as well. I've heard a lot of people have the same opinion.

My brother gave me a copy of Wyrd Sisters. I loved the book and it loved me back. It was the only reason I was not totally useless that dreadful day.  Thank you Terry Pratchett!

I somehow had no idea that there were novels until a classmate mentioned them one day in school. The next time I was at the library I sought them out, mainly in the hope that reading the books might explain how to solve some of the bizarre puzzles in the games.  The first book I found in the library was The Light Fantastic, and I had no idea that it was a direct sequel. I hadn't a clue what was going on for the first 30 pages or so, but I loved the characters, the jokes, and the use of language so I kept on reading. The next week at the library I found Equal Rites, and the week after that Mort. Once I ran out of books in the library, I made a deal with my parents to buy me one book a week in lieu of pocket money. Eventually, I had them all."

I checked it out, and found that it didn't seem at all familiar on the inside, but that it was one of the best books I'd ever read. It also really hammered home to me how every book is both an introduction to the series for the new reader as without being tiring for those more versed in Discworld lore."

I proceeded to acquire (by purchasing or gifts) each book and reading most of them in order (I read most of the Tiffany Aching series out of order from the 'adult' series). I try to reread at least 5 each year.  About halfway through the series I started looking into his other books and started with Nation. I fell in love with that book and to this day it is my favourite. I then read Strata then Dark side of the Sun. Then The Bromeliad/Nome Trilogy and the Johnny Trilogy. For those of you who haven't branched out into his other books, I recommend you go out and pick one up (Nation or Dark Side of the Sun would be my recommendations).   Recently, I've started reading translations of his books in both French and Russian. I hope to have most of the series in these three languages, and possibly adding more. I've actually been trying to find a copy of Nation in Russian for 4 years now. It's impossible.

I read a lot of fantasy in the late 80s and esp. liked retellings of classic tales like fairy tales or Shakespeare. I read ""Gevatter Tod"" (Mort) and ""Der Zauberhut"" (Sorcery) after that and I remember having no idea what was going on, but liking it. I switched to the English books then, which wasn't really easy back then with no internet bookstores and the sales people at the local bookstore having to use typewriters for my orders. Luckily the books became kind of popular and the bookstore stocked them. The web caught on and so I read the books after that in publication order when they were released. Then his books became so popular, that they started publishing the new ones as hardcover first. I buy only PB and the long wait began. From then on, that was something that happened to the majority of book series I started to read.

I was 10, and have been a fan ever since. With all the books I have read since, no one has ever surpassed Pterry, and only Charles Stross has come close enough to be worth mentioning (he is very different, but almost at the same level of awesome.

discworld,2z2p0h,KrzysztofKietzman,4,Sun Mar 15 00:30:17 2015 UTC,"Just a short FAQ, since these questions keep popping up:   Despite maintaining the Guide I ALSO recommend publishing order for a first attempt at the Discworld. I've read the entire series two or three times in publishing order before making the Guide. So I'm with the ""publishing order"" camp on this one :-). The Guide is not official at all. It is one particular fan's take on the links between the novels. It is based on a much older German guide once linked to from L-Space, which in turn was based on an even older ASCII guide (which I've never seen). In hindsight, I regret naming it the ""reading order"" guide. I should have stuck with ""major plotlines"" or something to that effect. The PDF for translators is available via the e-mail on the Guide. Just drop me a note."

discworld,2yzrgr,lewiseason,5,Tue Mar 17 14:54:57 2015 UTC,"Cross-posted from this thread. You'll need your very own Hex, or at least a Linux server running Centos with Apache installed and running. For everyone else, this will probably be gobbledygook, sorry about that.    These steps worked for me on a Centos server with Apache. You'll need to be the root user for all these steps.  Don't use .htaccess if you can avoid it. If you have access to do so, it is better to edit the apache config at /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf and add these lines to ""Section 2"", the main server configuration (make a backup of the file first, in case you mess it up!):  <IfModule headers_module>     header set Clacks-Overhead ""GNU Terry Pratchett"" </IfModule>   I know many people are using X-Clacks-Overhead, but the X- prefix is deprecated.  Check that the mod-headers module is enabled. Run this command:  grep ""LoadModule *headers"" /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf   If the above grep command gives you output like LoadModule headers_module modules/mod_headers.so you should be good to go, but if there is no output at all, you will need to install the mod_headers module and add the above line to the apache config. I haven't tried it, but yum install mod-headers might work. If the line is commented out with a # at the start, use your favourite editor to uncomment the line.  Restart apache by running: service httpd restart.  Test that it all works. Running curl -I www.yourdomain.com should print out a bunch of lines. If you see Clacks-Overhead: GNU Terry Pratchett then everything is working."

Lord Rust is a poor villain as well, so easy to beat that the real compelling challenge of the story was Vimes' dark side not beating him up physically. Raising Steam was excellent because it showed these fully-developed characters just getting on with their lives, after their maturation around the 5th Elephant / Thief of Time / Carpe Jugulum era and pretty much running out of story ideas since. the only real character arc that wasn't yet complete was that of Tiffany Aching, and that story would have just been her maturing fully as a witch, and might possibly involve the retirement of Esmerelda Weatherwax, with Granny going off all proud and alone and unbeaten, and Nanny bowing out with some Ogg-style happiness, with neither of them to ever actually die.  Just like Terry. he isn't dead, it's just that the author isn't going to write any more books about him."
discworld,2z09yv,I_BUGGER_HEDGEHOGS,3,Sat Mar 14 12:48:53 2015 UTC,"We can decide to feel a satisying completeness with the series, as if it were all wrapped up with a little bow, but it wasn't done. Not really. That's just our human need to believe in order, and perceive it whether it exists or not.   An amazing ride with a brilliant mind was mangled and wrecked by disease and time. I'm not going to put a bow on that. There were new places and new characters to come, and they're all lost. Only Sir Terry could make Death popular, but death is still brutal, still cruel, still loss, and I still hate it."

Lots of cowards, the Klatchians,"" said Colon. ""The moment they taste a bit of cold steel they're legging it away over the sand.""   Sergeant Colon had had a broad education. He'd been to the School of My Dad Always Said, the College of It Stands to Reason, and was now a postgraduate student at the University of What Some Bloke In the Pub Told Me.   ""Shouldn't be any trouble to sort out, then?"" said Nobby.   ""And o'course, they're not the same colour as what we are,"" said Colon. ""Well... as me, anyway,"" he added, in view of the various hues of Corporal Nobbs. There was probably no–one alive who was the same colour as Corporal Nobbs.   ""Constable Visit's pretty brown"" said Nobby. ""I never seen him run away. if there's a chance of giving someone a religious pamphlet ole Washpot's after them like a terrier.""   ""Ah, but Omnians are more like us,"" said Colon. ""Bit weird but, basic'ly, just the same as us underneath. No, the way you can tell a Klatchian is, you look an' see if he uses a lot of words beginning with “al”, right? 'Cos that's a dead giveaway. They invented all the words starting with “al”. That's how you can tell they're Klatchian. Like al–cohol, see?""  ""They invented beer?""   ""Yeah.""  ""That's clever.""   "" wouldn't call it clever,"" said Sergeant Colon, realizing too late that he'd made a tactical error. ""More, luck, I'd say.""  ""What else did they do?""   ""Well, there's..."" Colon racked his brains. ""There's al–gebra. That's like sums with letters. For... for people whose brains aren't clever enough for numbers, see?""  ""Is that a fact?""   ""Right...""said Colon. ""In fact,"" he went on, a little more assertively now he could see a way ahead, ""I heard this wizard down the University say that the Klatchians invented nothing. That was their great contribution to maffs, he said. I said “What?” an' he said, they come up with zero.""   ""Dun't sound that clever to me,"" said Nobby. ""Anyone could invent nothing. I ain't invented anything.""   ""My point exactly,"" said Colon. ""I told him, it was people who invented numbers like four and, and–""  ""–seven–""  ""–right, who were the geniuses. Nothing didn't need inventing. It was just there. They probably just found it.""   ""It's having all that desert,"" said Nobby.   ""Right! Good point. Desert. Which, as everyone knows, is basically nothing. Nothing's a natural resource to them. It stands to reason. Whereas we're more civilized, see, and we got a lot more stuff around to count, so we invented numbers. It's like... well, they say the Klatchians invented astronomy–""   ""'Al–tronomy,"" said Nobby helpfully.   ""No, no... no, Nobby, I reckon they'd discovered esses by then, probably nicked' em off'f us... anyway, they were bound to invent astronomy, 'cos there's bugger all else for them to look at but the sky. Anyone can look at the stars and give 'em names. 's going it a bit to call it inventing, in any case. We don't go around saying we've invented something just because we had a quick dekko at it.""  ""'I heard where they've got a lot of odd gods,"" said Nobby.   ""Yeah, and mad priests,"" said Colon. ""Foaming at the mouth, half of 'em. Believe all kinds of loony things.""   They watched the painter in silence for a moment. Colon was dreading the question that came.   ""So how exactly are they different from ours, then?"" said Nobby. ""I mean, some of our priests are–""  ""I hope you ain't being unpatriotic,"" said Colon severely.   ""No, of course not. I was just asking. I can see where they'd be a lot worse than ours, being foreign and everything.   ""And of course they're all mad for fighting,"" said Colon. ""Vicious buggers with all those curvy swords of theirs.""   ""You mean, like...they viciously attack you while cowardly running away after tasting cold steel?"" said Nobby, who sometimes had a treacherously good memory for detail.   ""You can't trust 'em, like I said. And they burp hugely after meals.""  ""Well... so do you, sarge.""  ""Yes, but I don't pretend it's polite, Nobby.""   ""Well, it's certainly a good job there's you around to explain things, sarge,"" said Nobby. ""It's amazing the stuff you know.""  ""I surprise myself, sometimes,"" said Colon modestly.  Edit : Formatting  Also, the Vimes' line mentioned by OP,  It was so much easier to blame it on Them. It was bleakly depressing to think that They were Us.   If it was Them, then nothing was anyone's fault. If it was Us, what did that make Me?  After all, I'm one of Us. I must be. I've certainly never thought of myself as one of Them.  No-one ever thinks of themselves as one of Them.   We're always one of Us. It's Them that do the bad things."

She teaches me if you can do something about it even if its not your fault or responsibility it says something about your integrity to roll up your sleeves and that no matter the job big or small do it right or not at all. And there's a satisfaction in the small things and the big things are just big small things.

discworld,2ywdu3,TheLoneEnderman,31,Sat Mar 14 16:01:58 2015 UTC,"I first read Terry Pratchett over twenty years ago. I saw a shelf of his books in a bookshop and picked one up, liked what I read and walked out with a (paid for) copy of The Colour of Magic. I remember I enjoyed it but I didn't love it, but I persevered, I bought The Light Fantastic, and then Equal Rites and then Mort.  And.Then.Mort. I can't put in to words how much I loved this book. I didn't so much read it as breathe it in. I laughed out loud, I giggled and smirked and smiled... and I fell in love. As I closed the covers and put my head back and shut my eyes I knew I had found a world I wanted to be a part of. And I dived head long in to that world. Over the years I made friends with Sam, with Granny W and Nanny O, with Carrot, with Moist, with Tiffany, with Susan and with Death himself. I made friends with hundreds of witches and wizards and trolls and assassins and thieves and vampires and Igors and werewolves and dwarves and purveyors of meat based products inna bun. I was even friends with Nobby if the sun's wasn't too hot and the wind's in the right direction.  These characters between the pages of a book became my friends. I cared about them. I still care about them. I considered the writer of these books my friend, even though we had never met and now never will.  Up until now every year has ticked by with the absolute certainty that there will be another Terry Pratchett book to read. That will not be the case any more. I will miss my friends but at least I can revisit the past in the books. And I can introduce them to my son and my daughter, so that they can feel the love and affection too.  GNU Terry Pratchett.

discworld,2ywdu3,kolpime,22,Fri Mar 13 13:39:11 2015 UTC,"My first Discworld book was Night Watch. It came to me in my late teens, and my paperback has been read and re-read almost to destruction since.  From Night Watch, from Sam Vimes, and from Sir Terry, I learned the importance of sticking to what you believe and doing the job that's in front of you, even when everything else in the world is crashing down around your ears. I learned how to face past mistakes, and deal with the age-old conundrum of what I would tell myself if I could go back and meet my 16-year-old self, knowing what I know now. I learned a few very choice facts about human nature in a crisis, and how easy it can be to accomplish huge feats, good or ill, when you decide to make the law your own instead of follow someone else's.    I learned to honour those taken from us too soon. And, most poignantly of all, I learned how they rise up. Thanks, Sir Terry."
discworld,2ywdu3,SammyVimes,18,Fri Mar 13 12:02:33 2015 UTC,"I'll come right out of the gate and admit that I have little time for high fantasy in general. Most of the stuff out there is too highfalloutin' or dense or tropish for me to enjoy without wondering if the author ever got beyond the fairy tales portion of their childhood.    Then came along Sir Pratchett's Discworld series into my reading and things haven't been the same since. Rather than skewer the tropes of fantasy outright, Pratchetts ability to point them out via either a very thin or nonexistent fourth wall was a revelation to my teenage brain. As I got older and read more one thing became clear; the man knew the tropes and knew what was ridiculous, but he also knew the best parts of high fantasy and treated the genre with the kind of care and attention that most writers can't even muster for one book, let alone an entire franchise.  I could go on, but anything I might mention has been said before and more eloquently, so I'll leave things there. Besides I'm only on Sourcery in my long re-read of the franchise."

Each re-read revealed something I missed before and added to the whole experience.  These books have had a massive effect on the way that I think, act and view the world, shaping my sense of humor and personality along the way.  Sam Vimes taught me to do the job that's in front of you, even if it means being doing something distasteful  Death taught me not to judge people by preconceived notions  Rincewind taught me that its not the running too that's important, its the from :)  And Terry taught me to use my imagination by sharing his own.

Reading a piece about Discworld, I became fascinated with all the silly little implications of belief-based magic and just knew I had to read some of it for myself. I checked out The Colour of Magic from my local library and I was hooked. I read Small Gods next, as it was the only other Discworld book that wasn't checked out, and... then I went to college, and between all the chaos that has ensued since then and my poor attention span, I haven't really done much reading for pleasure. I purchased and read a good chunk of Thud!, but I never finished it, and I seem to have misplaced my copy.  I'm not sure why his death hit me so hard, since I'm barely acquainted with his work, but I'm taking it as a sign that I need to get back into Discworld. I'm going to celebrate his life by better getting to know the world he's built over all these years. I'll do my part to ensure his name isn't forgotten, and maybe, just maybe, a little bit of magic will leak out of the pages..."

My dad and I went to see him give a talk about Dodger at Hay Festival, and we bumped into Terry and Rob in the car park! He signed The Colour of Magic, and seemed just as surprised as I was.   I'd had this slightly foolish idea of showing him some of my own writing - various bits of fantasy stuff. I did have a try after his talk, but he waved me off. Later Rob Wilkins explained by email why - plagiarism and all that - but passed on a bit of crucial advice: write every day, every single day, and then you might get somewhere.   I've taken that advice to heart in recent months, after the death of another creator I admired. He was an inspiration to me, and always will be."
discworld,2ywdu3,dantemp,15,Fri Mar 13 12:45:57 2015 UTC,"I was given Night Watch for Christmas years ago. I was maybe 15 or 16. I read that to destruction before buying all the rest of the Watch books. Then I moved on to the Death series, the Witches, then the Industrial Revolution books (Moving Pictures through to Raising Steam).  I'm finally making a start on The Colour of Magic, with the determination to read the rest of the Discworld. It's sad enough that we will never know the rest of the stories Pterry wanted to tell, so I'll be damned if I don't read the ones he was able to write.  I love his writing style for the biting satire he produces seemingly by accident. The Disc skewers and mirrors our own world just by telling stories that happen there.  Favourite books...the top one for me would be my first, Night Watch, simply for introducing me to the world. Thud ranks very highly too. The idea that Vimes' will to be a force for good has created his own 'Internal Watchman' is amazing. For a man who believes so strongly in reshaping the world to resist using the incredible power he has, knowing that he could rid the world of so many evils with a sword, but choosing not to...that's an impressive feat.  The rest of the Watch books will always be quoted whenever prejudice is discussed. They hold a mirror up to our own prejudices, whether casual stereotyping (Jingo) or the extremist hatred of the new (Thud/Raising Steam), and show us that really, people are all people. They want today to be followed by tomorrow. No matter what they eat for breakfast or what their pubs look like.  Finally, the Death books taught me not to fear Death, for he is not a malevolent force. He simply turns up at the allotted time. ""What can the harvest hope for, if not the care of the Reaper Man?"" - such an incredible phrase. Noli timere messorem."

If JK Rowling is one of the world's most admirable people for her charitable work and selflessness, then Pratchett was (and still is) one of the world's most admirable personalities.

I don't even remember what the other three were, but Mort I remember. It was a defining moment in my life that has shaped who I've been for the past 24 years, the Discworld books opened up my mind not just to this world but to other worlds, worlds that I could make exist just by thinking about them, worlds where the rules were whatever I wanted them to be. I spent the majority of my childhood and teenage years with my nose in a book and eagerly waited for every new Discworld novel, never knowing what to expect from each one and never being disappointed.  His books taught me so much, about third and fourth thoughts and how to uncover what drives people, and all with a brilliant satirical humour. I learned how to flex my imagination, we didn't have much growing up and some days I would just go sit in a quiet room and just think about stuff. I always planned to write some of that stuff down, once I'd figured out the details, and in the past few years I've begun authoring my own stories. I feel like I owe it to Terry, his books were after all the dumbbells that I used to flex my imagination's muscles with. Even if I never write anything worthwhile, I owe it to him to use what he gave me.   My favourite book of his will always be Night Watch, getting to peer into the past of all those characters in the Watch series was delightful, and there were some truly tragic moments in it that had me weeping. To think that I wont get to read the next chapter in those, or any of his character's lives makes me hurt inside, but I am filled with immeasurable joy that nothing can take away the stories that we already have."

Twenty odd years ago I spent a teenage summer holiday carefully typing a stage play version of Men At Arms into my father's prized laptop, not knowing that pTerry & Stephen Briggs had produced an official version as internet access was a tricky thing back then in New Zealand. I showed it to my drama teacher thinking perhaps we could do a scene in class, and she suggested sending him a copy via email through his publishing contact.  Lo and behold we exchanged a few emails and he kindly requested a printed copy of my efforts as a memento; I thought nothing could've been more inspirational to a teenage writer, until I saw a throwaway character appear near the end of The Truth a couple of years later which appeared to reference my then nom de plume, Mister Biscuit, and my homeland.

discworld,2ywdu3,hausi22,11,Sat Mar 14 23:55:32 2015 UTC,"Terry Pratchett was the only stranger I ever loved. He wrote an entire world into existence and breathed into every character a sense of purpose and depth and humanity. Even the small ones. Even the cruel ones. To him I owe so much of my self, and my vision of the world, which I will humbly admit is far from complete.  Here was a man who grasped, more than anyone I have ever seen, the absurdity, the darkness, the wonder and the humour inherent in existence. He weaved a great many threads into a thick fabric of philosophy at once cynical and hopeful, profane and divine.  It lies beyond the scope of my ability to recount the numerous lessons which I learned in the pages of his books. There are simply too many. And while it is difficult to choose one above all in terms of value and importance, I can probably state the most resonant one for me at this time. That life is a succession of moments, infinitely divisible into smaller and smaller slices of time. The world as we see it now did not exist a moment ago. The only appropriate response is surprise, and joy and gratitude. We cannot argue how it should be; there isn't a way things should be. There's just what happens, and what we do.  Terry Pratchett is not done teaching us. He has not finished entertaining us. The song remains.  ""He's dead. However, credit where it's due, he hasn't let that stop him."""
discworld,2ywdu3,air8orne,10,Fri Mar 13 19:21:49 2015 UTC,"I admittedly haven't read a lot of Sir Terry's work. Good Omens has been a favorite of mine for years now, and a friend is helping me get started with Discworld. But I really fell in love with him from his documentary on the right to die. It touched me, it lit a fire under me, and now as a caretaker of a person with many health issues, it's opened my eyes that death isn't something to be feared. Face it, embrace it, and keep moving. Because death is just another part of the journey.   Thank you Sir Terry. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. I can't wait to delve into Discworld and watch you forever live on through your words."
discworld,2ywdu3,8023root,8,Fri Mar 13 13:33:04 2015 UTC,"My first Terry Pratchett book was Thief of Time (in German), which was given to my by mother when I was 13 or 14. It was the first book that made laugh out loud (the scene when the cherry trees change) from that moment I was in love with his writing. These books have shaped my sense of humour and how I view the world. His ability to expose the absurdities of life and our culture was just amazing.  Often when I can't sleep or when I think about a subject he has touched on, I pick up one of his books and reread it. They give me so much comfort and let me escape this world, when I don't feel like dealing with it. I often read his books in one sitting, even though I have read them before, they still manage to pull me in like nothing else.  Although it feels like choosing a favourite child, the two books I love the most are Small Gods and Jingo (followed by Monstrous Regiment and Night Watch). I think these two books manage to nearly sum up  the human psyche. If I was president of the world, they would be required reading for everyone learning about history, politics and religion.  Yesterday I sat at home crying (I don't think there is anyone else that I don't know personally whose death would affect me as much), but today let's celebrate Sir Terrys brilliance!   It was so much easier to blame it on Them. It was bleakly depressing to think that They were Us. If it was Them, then nothing was anyone's fault. If it was Us, what did that make Me? After all, I'm one of Us. I must be. I've certainly never thought of myself as one of Them. No one ever thinks of themselves as one of Them. We're always one of Us. It's Them that do the bad things.   -Jingo   It is a popular fact that nine-tenths of the brain is not used and, like most popular facts, it is wrong... It is used. And one of its functions is to make the miraculous seem ordinary and turn the unusual into the usual. Because if this was not the case, then human beings, faced with the daily wondrousness of everything, would go around wearing big stupid grins, similar to those worn by certain remote tribesmen who occasionally get raided by the authorities and have the contents of their plastic greenhouses very seriously inspected.   -Small Gods"

I will celebrate Sir Terry's life view with my kids when they come and try not to choke up every time I read one of my favorite quotes of his.  “You can't give her that!' she screamed. 'It's not safe!'  IT'S A SWORD, said the Hogfather. THEY'RE NOT MEANT TO BE SAFE.  'She's a child!' shouted Crumley.  IT'S EDUCATIONAL.  'What if she cuts herself?'

I have since read every discworld novel at least twice and despite my username my fave characters are actually rincewind (my first love) and Sam Vimes. Although I could reel off about a hundred other characters that are both memorable and fantastic so it feels a little unfair to pick!  For every train journey that flew by, for every late night turning page after page, every chuckle and every tear, thank you Sir Terry.  “A dwarf who can't get the hang of metal? That must be pretty unique.""  ""Pretty rare, sir. But I was quite good at alchemy..""  ""Guild member?""  ""Not any more, sir.""  ""Oh? How did you leave the guild?""  ""Through the roof, sir. But I'm pretty certain I know what I did wrong.”"

He brought me home truckers diggers and wings on cassette,  then the Johnny books and then on to discworld.  I used to sit up late in to the night with a dictionary next to me still most of the puns and references went over my head but I could never put down the book. I was lucky enough to get hold of copies before they hit the shelf and some preprint editions. Nearly all of which have basically fallen apart from being read countless times.   He taught me to read and very probably taught me to think.  I have never cried because someone I didn't know died, I don't think I even cried when my grandmother died.  But I did for him. I dug out my old copy of jonny and the dead and gave it a read, funny that what I did in an hour would have taken me weeks when I first held that book.   I have given it to my friends son now I hope it opens his mind as much as it did mine."

From reading the colour of magic in my twenties on a long distance train, and letting my amusement eat up the miles, to Raising Steam, he always tended to leave me with a smile on my face.

I was heavily bullied throughout my first ten years of school, and it was through his books that I was able to see that a better life was possible. Helped me see that not all people are monsters, no matter how much it may seem so.   I can honestly say that his writings helped me avoid suicide in my early teens. Not only that, they've shaped my ethical leanings, my sense of humour, the way I view the world. He and his works form a huge part of the very bedrock of my life."

discworld,2ywdu3,Fulcro,6,Sat Mar 14 02:55:28 2015 UTC,"I've been sitting on this story for a while now, and I suppose this thread is as appropriate a place for it as it gets. I like to think of it as an example of narrativium at work.  When I was 13 years old, my parents, little sister and myself went to Land's End. At seven, my sister was just old enough to go on the big slide, which was inside a pirate-ship-like structure, making it dark and a bit spooky. Aware of my role as big sis, I agreed to go with her and go first. However, as the slide itself was metal and involved a sheer drop at the top before curving towards the bottom, and I was wearing cut-off shorts (this being the mid-nineties), I ended up with nasty friction burns on the backs of my bare legs. As I staggered out into the sunlight, tears welling up in my eyes, I spotted something unusual, a dark rectangle on the bright white sand. Someone appeared to have dropped a book.  I went to pick it up. It was a paperback novel, and the cover gave off some intriguing mixed signals. The illustration looked whimsical, childish even, but the subject matter... There was a skeleton with bright blue eyes in dungarees and a straw hat, holding a scythe. I turned it over. ""Death is missing, presumed... Er... Gone,"" said the blurb. I turned it over again. Terry Pratchett. ""Reaper Man"". What on Earth was this about?   Before I could start leafing through it to have a proper look, my mother grabbed my arm and told me rather brusquely that we were going to a first aid station, NOW. The backs of my thighs were stinging; something was starting to ooze down to my calves. I didn't want to leave the book on the ground - it didn't seem right - so I propped it up on the nearest rock and limped after my mum.  Two years later, at 15, I frequently spent my Saturdays at a shop that sold PC games on CD-rom. It had been named after a series of comic fantasy novels that everyone there kept telling me to check out. I didn't have high hopes for my local, very rural Dutch community library, which only owned a single bookcase of volumes in English. With the internet feeling strange and unwieldy, however (this still being the mid-nineties), it seemed like the best place to start looking.  In that one bookcase, on the shelf labelled ""M-T"", there was a single volume by Terry Pratchett. I took it down, looked at it, and was overcome by an odd sense of deja vu. The cover illustration looked whimsical, perhaps even childish, which clashed oddly with its subject matter: a blue-eyed skeleton in dungarees, standing in a field, holding a scythe. ""Reaper Man."" I turned it over and read the blurb. ""Death is missing, presumed... Er... Gone.""  While I've never recovered the faith I lost at 11, that was the moment that convinced me that some things are meant to happen, and that if something gets in the way the first time around, life may well give you a second chance. A lot of Reaper Man went over my head, but the next Discworld novel I read, the first I actually bought - Mort - sucked me in. For years, I would read new releases rather like Charlie Bucket nibbling away at his annual bar of chocolate: making sure not to get through it all too quickly, checking every so often to see how much I had left.   I think it's time for a re-read."
discworld,2ywdu3,Pinwheeling,6,Sat Mar 14 11:36:20 2015 UTC,"I started this post as a new take on the ""about the author""-note in Pratchetts older books, but it soon took a different turn. I still think that it's appropriate, so here we go:  Terry Pratchett was born in 1948 and though he may have passed away he still lives on in his works, his friends and family and in his fans.  He was a creator of worlds. Just like Tiffany Aching had the hills in her bones, he had the Discworld in his, and vice versa. So if we walk the Disc by reading his books, he will always be near.  In Jingo he wrote ""Give a man a fire and he's warm for a day, but set fire to him and he's warm for the rest of his life."" His book set many people on fire (not literally, of course), and those who have been set ablaze, will always be able to feel that warmth.  So let's do just that: Walk the Disc with a happy and a sad eye, feeling the flames of his storytelling, and keep the fire burning.  GNU Terry Pratchett"

I hadn't, and he loaned me Small Gods when we started dating.  I loved Pratchett's tone and insights.  It started a trend of my fiancé loaning me books he thinks I'll like (including many more Pratchett books!).  I drew him a picture of DiscWorld on the elephants and turtle riding through space for our first anniversary.  I'll always think of Pratchett's work as not only fantastic writing, but a big part of meeting the love of my life too. :)"

But I never wanted to accept it. He was my role model, the only one I ever really had. A lot of the way I am as a person is through reading his books, again and again and again. At first they were funny, then they were educational, then they were inspirational. Friday was the first time I've cried as an adult male outside immediate family funerals. I'm so thankful that Sir Terry was who he was. I'd be some other bloke otherwise, and that doesn't bear thinking about.   Anyway, to the point. I was in Dan Murphy's (basically an alcohol only supermarket) and saw these. I'm sure he'd approve."

He knew that this may be the last so he gave us the final pages of the chapter of the discworld history he was writing, but letting the world live on so that there was the chance for new stories to unfold.  So I am sad that he is dead, but not that the books are over, they told stories but also started new ones, and people will always remember those stories he never had the chance to tell, and they will be the greatest of all.

I started with Reaper Man and was hooked thereon. In the past three years, I finished all the Discworld novels upto Snuff, thanks to libraries.  These books, with their intensity, charm, and dry wit, have affected me like few others. Often while reading, I could feel these were more than mere books. They reflected Sir Terry Pratchett's anger at the injustice, inequality, violence and greed that we often come across in our lives- first hand or via the news. These books addressed these issues and more with a dry mocking humour that is rarely found. They often felt like rallying cries for basic human dignity that is so often eroded.  I intend to celebrate the life of this great man by going back to the library and rereading all the Discworld novels one by one over the next few months. It will allow me to relieve great memories and help overcome some of the pain I feel at his passing.  RIP Sir Terry."

I have never read a book by either of the two I didn't like, something I cannot say of any other author.   It's incredibly hard to pick a favorite quote... I love all the descriptions hat seem so obvious and yet so unique like ""on a clear day, you can see last Tuesday"" or ""so wet he was approaching dryness from the other side"".  But maybe even more it amazes me how some of the jokes have really long build ups, and yet I hardly ever see them coming.

My parents always let me know that when it comes to books, the budget is unlimited. But I've never, up to that point, went and ordered a dozen books at once...  Since then, I always got them as soon as they were published. I have two copied of Small Gods because me and my mother both happened to be in different book stores the day it came out.

I can still recall the exact feeling as I finished the first book - I think it was the Light Fantastic, but you know, I'm not sure. It's that long ago. It might even have been Strata. He's been a part of my reading life that long.  I know that I held the book at arm's length amazed at what I'd just read. He blew me away. I spent my (pre-internet) days searching for anything else he had written and then read every damn book as he wrote them year after year.  I went to a couple of events down under and met him. He was tired and grumpy and all the more wonderful for it. He was a decent human being and had a mind so amazing I don't know how to describe it.  And now he's gone and it's stopped and I can't be bitter, because he gave us so much. But, I can be sad. So damn sad.  I wrote an article on own my blog trying to explain how it feels, but it isn't enough. What words can be enough?  Thank you for the article. Reading this, your comments, and the magnificent GNU Terry Pratchett thread, it's really what I needed.  This place feels like being on the old L-Space web or on the old alt.fan.pratchett and a lot of other places like it. How I feel: yes, some of my friends understand. But not like this.   His words and his books created communities and forged friendships.   His words will outlast him and will outlast us.   I miss him all the same. It just hurts so damn much.

One Christmas I asked for a signed copy of Monstrous Regiment but there wasn't any available on the online shop.

I came to really love the characters: Nanny Ogg, Greebo, Vimes, Carrot, Death, and The Librarian, to name a few.  I never found another author with the same heart as Sir Terry, and it's only his books that leave me with the ""warm fuzzies"" when I'm through.

discworld,2ywdu3,Shadowing_Lemma,3,Sat Mar 14 00:42:02 2015 UTC,I read Good Omens several years ago when I was 15. It was my first Pratchett book ever. The only reason I read it was because of Gaiman. I was interested by the book it took several years until I was in college for me to actually pick up and read an actual Discworld book. But when I did finally read them I loved them. I spent an entire summer during an internship traveling to the local Half Price Book and picking up what ever they had of his that I hadn't read. I think I read almost a book every three to two days and I still haven't read all of them. Planning to do that this year. I'm glad for the great memories these books have given me. The tons of laughs I got...and of course ook.

Since then I've read literally everything he's written and have had the great pleasure of meeting him several times over the years. His writing, beyond the wit, was full of wisdom and profound insight, containing greater philosophical depth than many gave him credit for.   There've been a great many, quite dramatic, ups and downs in my life, but PTerry and his work were constants. He'd been with me for over 24 years and it feels like I've lost a dear, dear friend. I'll be celebrating his life by re-reading his books, getting that long-delayed referential tattoo (once I decide on a design), and, if I have the fortune, buying a first edition hardback of Reaper Man.

discworld,2ywdu3,Imogthe,3,Sat Mar 14 11:19:27 2015 UTC,"It's taken me a few days of quiet contemplation (in the evenings, on the commute to and from work, cooking dinner, etc) to be able to write this without sudden and inexplicable appearances of things getting in my eyes :) I've not posted in this sub before but now the time is right.  I started reading the Discworld books one summer way back in the days. A friend's father ran a flooring and carpeting company and they needed someone to a) keep my friend company when he was working sites and b) lug things around. It was my first job that paid anything like a living wage so I was chuffed to bits raking in the cash (certainly felt like it at the time). Work started early and ended late, but I had weekends to myself so I hit the book stores with my new found fortune (I've always been an avid reader). Being a non native English speaker in a non English speaking country it wasn't a given that I'd buy a Discworld book (translated or not), never mind an English one. I'd been attending English classes at school for years (being mandatory second language) but never really read all that much. On a whim I hit the English books section in the store and found the entire published Discworld collection (thus far) in a row. This colourful display drew my eye (Paul Kidby's art is nothing if not colourful!) and I thought to myself ""what the hell, I have money to burn"". I can't remember which book I picked up first but when I got home I arranged myself in a chair on the veranda with snacks and drinks readily at hand. And then words happened. Glorious marvellous wonderful words. They didn't stop until the last page.   This was a Saturday and the shops were closed on Sundays. Monday through Friday was an agony of waiting for Saturday so I could get more of this weird and wonderful magic trapped between the covers of a book. It was probably the best summer of my life to date when I think back - a pleasant rhythm of work, eat, sleep, and spending the weekends oblivious to everything but the next book in my pile.  I still have my first books from that time, and have supplemented with new publications as they were released. I read the entire Discworld series again every few years when the fancy takes me and as other commenters have remarked, I find something new every time.  What I find remarkable is how the books (be they Discworld or not) Terry wrote work on so many levels. There is the ""simple"" superficial story (by superficial I mean the actions and events being performed and perpetrated upon the characters, not that the storytelling is shallow), and then you find layers of social commentary and observations on so many things. Needless to say my first reading was on the superficial level, but as I grew older my mind matured and developed I started picking up on the deeper meanings.  I find myself looking forward to my read throughs these days. It's like meeting an old friend and picking up exactly where you left off the last time. There are no awkward moments or pauses, we know each other intimately now. I pick up the book and it delivers. Every time without fail.  My favourite story arc has to be the Night Watch, but the Witches come a close second. Tiffany's story is up there too. And the Wizards of course. And ᴅᴇᴀᴛʜ of course. All the arcs really. But the Night Watch stands out to me. The story of Samuel Vimes starting out at the lowest level and working his way to the top (despite not really wishing to ) while struggling with very human problems resonates with me. Having had the honour and privilege of serving in the armed forces I suppose I see myself in him in a small way so I might not be entirely unbiased :)  So where am I going with all this? I suppose it's important to me to add my voice to the clacks as it were, to speak into the night because it matters to me that I do even if nobody listens. Terry gave me the greatest gift I can conceive of - that of the English language in all its glorious madness. He showed me doors, and what lies beyond if you but dare. He gave me worlds I can roam at will and explore at the flick of a page. I have laughed and cried, raged and rejoiced along with him, and you know what? I'll damn well do it all over again because my life would be all the poorer without it. I'm already chuckling anticipating Jingo: ""loitering within tent, and loitering with intent"". It cracks me up just thinking about it.  I for one will be raising a glass tonight and drink a toast to Terry, and to you my fellow mourners. I don't know you, and I (hope, for your sake) you don't know me but despite his passing I think we all have come out well and truly in the black. I drink to you, I drink to myself, and I pour one out for Terry in remembrance of that which is lost to us and in celebration of all that we have gained.  GNU pterry"

I especially loved Vetinari's description of life: “Down there - he said - are people who will follow any dragon, worship any god, ignore any inequity. All out of a kind of humdrum, everyday badness. Not the really high, creative loathsomeness of the great sinners, but a sort of mass-produced darkness of the soul. Sin, you might say, without a trace of originality. They accept evil not because they say yes, but because they don't say no.” These are words i try to remember every day"

Last year I started with The Colour of Magic and listened all the way through Raising Steam one after the other. Loved them all.  This year I'm listening to them again. I was half-way through Carpe Jugulum when I learned of Sir Terry's death. Here's hoping that in 50 years or so he'll be back at it, just like the old days."
discworld,2ywdu3,Disquietx,3,Sun Mar 15 20:23:19 2015 UTC,"44, German here, working on the clacks. I never was into Fantasy Stories in my early years. I always was a science fiction fan. Somewhere in the 80s i read a small review in a German Computer Games Magazine about a new Book from a new Author who doesn't ring a bell back then. They introduced him as the “Douglas Adams of Fantasy” and got me interested that way. I ordered the Book (Das Licht der Fantasie – The light fantastic) straight away and started reading it a few days later and I thought: Nice. Not great but not bad either.  What followed was a little break of some time and then I saw some more Books of him for the first time in a local Book Store and I remembered the first one and bought all the rest that day right away. The Color of Magic... Not bad... Equal Rites... Awesome! The hook was in! After that I bought every Book in German until I tested my English on the first two Harry Potters for the run up on The Lord of the Rings in English (because on Amazon there where(are) fighting about the different German translations, which one was the best, so I decided to cut the shit out and to go straight for the Originals). At that time I had started to order the Discworld Books in English because I couldn't wait for the Translation to be finished for the German Books. By then I could read the books fluent and only every five or ten pages I had to look something up in a dictionary... I started to order all the books I've already had in German in English too and that was quite an experience... There are details who got lost in the translation completly. And, oh boy, the posh language! Then i started to read Lord of the Rings and finished all Books in a row... But it was to late for Frodo and the lot, after reading so many Discworld books. The LOTR Series was just not my cup of tea. The Heroes too shiny, the Villians all too bad... Way to much Black and White for my taste. It had no life underneath. The first few Discworld books didn't had a deeper meaning too, but it started with Equal Rites (Equal Rights for Women) and it only got better and better.  Some of my favorite Characters (way too many to list them all) are Nobby Nobbs, Polly Perks 'Crivens! Whut aboot us, ye daftie!' Ah! Yes yes, aaaaand Rob Anybody and his Clan (who wouldn't like pictsies, who were kicked out of Fairyland by the Fairy Queen for causing fights and being drunk at two in the afternoon, after all.) My favourite Series is the Watch Series, the best Standalones are Small Gods and Monstrous Regiment because they give Religion a good kick into the unmentionables which helped me to come to term with Religions at large. And so it goes on... Click Click Click like the pieces on a Thud! Board. The books really changed my perspective on life in general. I've read them for over 25 years now, with little pauses, and will continue to read them, because they never get old or boring even after the 10th read. There is always something you didn't pick up the last time you've read them.  At the beginning of our Relationship i got my wife into reading them, although it was a hard start with the Color of Magic. After 50 Pages she refused to read on because she didn't liked it at all. Only after she read a later Book, she picked up the first one again and for four years in succession there was always a Discworld Book in here hands... I don't know how many complete rounds she did, but it was plenty! I plan to do the same with my Daughter in the near future, when she gets old enough. First I will start to read with her The Bromeliad Trilogy, Maurice, Tiffany and later the Discworld Series or do some Audio Books. Dirk Bach was quite good at it. The Nomes Triology, man I wish I had those as a kid... The Inside and the Outside Nomes... Such a fantastic Story!  Thank you dearly, Sir Terry Pratchett! For the good times I have with you books, all the wonderfull People i've met, all the Friends i have made and for all the important lessons you gave me.  oh. and i've wept... there are times, in the last days, i feel emtpy like golem without a chem...  GNU Terry Pratchett"
discworld,2ywdu3,rchase,3,Sun Mar 15 22:21:56 2015 UTC,"My girlfriend and I attended the Discworld convention in 2008. Having been introduced to the Discworld books hoping I could find an answer to solve the computer game. Hah, I then got distracted with the books and read them from the beginning to what soon will be their end.  I met Terry at the convention, heard him read Nation to us, discuss a variety of things and in the queue, because we like queues, someone saw him pass and call out ""we're not worthy! we're not worthy!"" to whit he retorted ""Corr-rect!"". He was right, of course.  It brought a smile, and my girlfriend was so nervous to speak with him but I pushed her into doing so anyway. ""Hello hovering lady"" he said, a name which will stick with her until the end of her own days, I imagine. Somewhere in Sir Terry's house will also be an A3 drawing of an orang-utan she gave to him, I'd like to think he at least admired it."
discworld,2ywdu3,Kassettenkind78,3,Sun Mar 15 23:51:50 2015 UTC,"It has been hard. In the course of the past few months I lost both of my grandparents (whom I loved very dearly) and then Sir Terry passed. I was still very much in denial at this point and somehow it pushed me over the edge, it made me realize that a chapter of my life is now closed and that there is no going back to it. It's a very sad experience but also one that makes you realize a lot of, at times simple, truths. It also made me realize how close to my heart Terry has been. His was propably the first book I picked by myself, in library while I was still in primary school. The first book I have read by myself.  Nowadays I read a lot and my taste is very eclectic. I love literature. Would I be wrong if I said I might possible own this to Mort? To be honest, propably not. For years I read nothing but Pratchett, at times swallowing a book a day. I also started writing because of how much I loved his writing. One of his books inspired my story for my native language class that I was so seriously about I spent more time on it than I propably did on my academic analyses at my University. My teacher loved it and wanted to send it to a competition, to this day it was one of the most important encouragements I have ever received. Years later I would love writing, I would find myself writing poetry and philosophical prose to relief my emotions and nowadays I'm a journalist on the side and I love what I'm doing. I owe it all to that single book, way back then. I still remember sitting on the floor, looking at the shelves and picking up that couriously looking book which was Mort. But it's not only that I owe to Sir Terry. He gave me countless hours, because I have not yet spent all of them, of fantastic journeys, laughter and a sense of kinship, understanding when I needed it during hardships which were also reliefed through the escape he provided. But it also provided much more, his stance on life (not only in his books but in general) influenced me from, pretty much, earliest childhood and I'm massively thankful for that. There is a lot more that could be said but I'm running out, and words cannot accurately paint some of the pictures no matter how hard we try. I will continue to read his books, recommend them to everyone I know and hopefully at one point raise my children with their presence. The world has lost a beautiful man but his heritage will live for a long time, because it by far deserves to. Goodbye Sir Terry, I hope you find your walk pleasant."
discworld,2ywdu3,rchase,6,Mon Mar 16 13:20:51 2015 UTC,"I'm not a person who goes in for the paranormal.  I did have a very strange experience this week, that I can't explain other than the odd and inevitable coincidental nature of... things and stuff.  Over the last two weeks, I've been re-reading the Tiffany Aching books, the first time I've picked up a Pratchett book in probably 2 years.  I was approaching the end of I Shall Wear Midnight late on Wednesday night.  I was reading through the section where the funeral for the Baron is being held, and Nanny Ogg gets up and sings the mourners into good spirit and celebrates the life of a good man who died well.  Tiffany is watching her closely, and thinking that though she always wanted to learn fire, she should instead have learned people.  In that moment, I experienced a powerful shudder and a wave of sorrow.  As I said, it was very late, and I'll admit to being a little drunk at the time, but I was inspired to write something. I've already posted it, but suffer me once again...    So that's it then, thought /u/rchase to himself.  All we've got is these... books.  Some many thousands of words, and the story is over.  The Teller has passed and it's all come to an End.  But, he thought, stories are famous for going on after they've ended.  They're fickle like that.    These second thoughts were accompanied by a deep sorrow.  His thought turned to the Teller.  It didn't sit right.  Many of His words had said to keep telling.  He felt a thump on his boot.    Looking down he saw a small blue man with red hair done up in knots, brandishing a scroll.    ""Yae canna die were ye already deid!  Another pagey for ya!""  /u/rchase took it up and read the tiny script.    ""Crivens! Ya scunner... E'ryone kens there's more tae this world than rightly gives a proper greetin' tae th' eyes.  Even Daft Wullie kens 'at!   We're lookin' oot for Him noo, and it's ye all Bigjobs' bizness tae go on about yer Tellin'.""  There seemed to be some sort of scuffle, and some cussing.  A sudden breeze passed and the fire flickered, though the windows were tightly shut.    The little blue man and the tiny scroll were gone.  /u/rchase sat back and smiled.    Something like 8 hours later Sir Terry passed.  When I saw the news in an unrelated thread in /r/books yesterday, for some reason I was deeply and thoroughly unsurprised.  Having just read of the Baron's funeral, and having thought long about it as I fell to sleep, it was as though I was fully emotionally prepared for the news, and felt nothing but a warm sense of joy... not at his passing, but at his good life.  One light blinking off in a sky full of stars.  I could hear The Larks Sing Melodious, and I saw a little boy in his new tweed jacket that smelled of wee, walking with his father under different stars.  Farewell and thank-you Sir Terry!  I'm quite certain the stories will go on after The End, and most likely in the most wonderful and unpredictable ways.    They're fickle like that."

discworld,2ywdu3,papoba,2,Sat Mar 14 18:28:20 2015 UTC,"Over the years of my high school and university, I've collected all Discworld books that have been translated to my language. Friend of mine recommended me the series and I loved this clever sense of humor and scientific bits he put here and there. Just like with all fantasy and sci-fi I had in my hands, I've never tried too hard to dive deep into the meaning of books, I was reading them for a good laugh and entertaining story (and boy, I had them in great amounts). I will wait few years more to forget everything and read it again, hoping to see the Prattchett and other authors' works in different light.  I have always liked this quote. For me, it is also a thing about the consumerism.  “Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles.  But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.  This was the Captain Samuel Vimes 'Boots' theory of socioeconomic unfairness.”"

A lady asked me about the latest Pratchett book...and in my ignorance a asked if she meant Terry Hatcher...I laughingly told my girlfriend at the time about this...and she was offended...I didn't get it.  Fast forward to 2008 and my roommates at the time kept telling me that I ought to read Pratchett (I fucking suck at reading!  At this point in my life...the most notable books I had read were Tuck Everlasting, Hot Zone, Harry Potter 1-7, LotR...a handful of King, and Gaiman's Smoke and Mirrors) needless to say, I logged Pratchett away as a ""some how...some day...""  fast forward to november 2011, I've discovered that Audiobooks are the best method of reading for me.  Fast forward to December 2012, and my first Pratchett book is Hogfather, I'm living in a shitty situation with my Brother and his girlfriend in humboldt county...my only escapes are walking around, playing Borderlands 2, and Audiobooks.  In a little over a year i had listened to all 40 discworld books...and they are considered my best friends I made in those Long months.    I've since relistened to many of my favorites (reaper man, thief of time, hogfather, the Guards series, and Tiffany Aching's series) numerous times.  My world, outlook, and piece of mind has been forever altered by his work!  I can't ever thank him for what he did for me, what he's shown me...I quote him regularly...I miss him more than I can articulate.  Terry Pratchett is the best thing that has happened to me...I will keep listening to his work until the moment of my death...and I can only hope I get to thank him in the hereafter..."
discworld,2yzd4z,wotrednuloot,2,Sat Mar 14 07:54:16 2015 UTC,You claim to be a shitty reader yet you finished LOTR? That's slightly contradictory That is a loooong trilogy.

discworld,2yzd4z,HarlequinValentine,2,Sat Mar 14 11:34:25 2015 UTC,"I first read a Terry Pratchett book when I was 11. I got Thief of Time from the school book club sale because I thought the cover was interesting. I didn't really understand it, but I loved it, and I knew I wanted more (I also wrote a review which won a Blue Peter badge, haha.)  I collected all his books from then on - which was pretty easy, given that the paperbacks turned up in secondhand and charity shops everywhere. He was the first writer that made me see writing, made me think ""wow, this is so funny and clever and true, I wish I could write like that.""  I just kind of loved his books in silence, I rarely ever talked to anyone about them and didn't know how to connect with other fans. I missed the only events with Sir Terry in my city (that I knew about) because I was in the middle of my GCSE exams. I did go to to the Postal Museum and buy some of the first Going Postal stamps, which I still have proudly framed at the top of my stairs.  It was only when reading one of his newer books that I noticed a mention of the Discworld Emporium. I almost kicked myself, knowing that there had been a shop for Discworld fans so near where I'd lived this whole time, and I hadn't known about it! We went to visit and the staff were so lovely and demanded we return for the Spring Fling. We did, and that's when I finally got to meet my hero. His memory and vocabulary were slow by then, but he was still brilliant. He stroked my cuddly turtle and stole my boyfriend's hat. I thanked him for everything and he told me how much he'd enjoyed writing Monstrous Regiment, which pleased me as it's one of my favourites.  After that we began to attend all the Hogswatch events, and even went to the Discworld Convention. I couldn't believe there was this whole community of people I'd never met before that all loved Discworld. It's been so much fun.  And, to top it all off, my book was published a few weeks ago. I thanked Sir Terry in the acknowledgements. I don't know where I'd be without him, but I think the answer is: probably not a writer, and with considerably fewer friends."

discworld,2yzd4z,Ivyleaf3,2,Sat Mar 14 12:18:54 2015 UTC,"I first discovered PTerry back in 1986 or 87, when ""The Light Fantastic"" was first published.  I still remember the moment like it was last week: I was in Minotaur Books, a Melbourne institution for comics and SF books since the eighties, and TLF was on display on the ground floor. I remember it well, I can almost see the books in their little pile in front of the SF&Fantasy shelves. (Back then, Minotaur was rather cramped for space.) I hadn't read ""The Colour Of Magic"", but the Kidby Josh Kirby cover caught my eye, and I picked it up and flipped through the book reading random passages, as I am wont to do, to decide whether or not to buy it. The instant I read the line about the Ice Giants and the Gods feuding because the Ice Giants wouldn't return the lawn mower, I had to buy the book, and I have never looked back since.  Sir Terry has ruined me for other writers, for which I will always be grateful. There are very few fiction authors I can read now, as they rarely meet the standards of his writing, and when I do lower myself to read the average high fantasy swords and sorcery epic, I cannot help but look at it from PTerry's perspective. Who takes away the night soil? How does the food get from the farms to the castle? Who sells sausages inna bun to the night watch? Hard-working guards need something hot and meat-like on a cold night.  I met my wife thanks to PTerry, we met on a Discworld mailing list, as well as so very good real life good friends and amusing acquaintances.  Thank you, PTerry.  Edit: I always mix up Paul Kidby and Josh Kirby."

Larry Finlay, MD at Transworld Publishers:  ""I was deeply saddened to learn that Sir Terry Pratchett has died. The world has lost one of its brightest, sharpest minds.  In over 70 books, Terry enriched the planet like few before him. As all who read him know, Discworld was his vehicle to satirize this world: he did so brilliantly, with great skill, enormous humour and constant invention.  Terry faced his Alzheimer's disease (an 'embuggerance', as he called it) publicly and bravely. Over the last few years, it was his writing that sustained him. His legacy will endure for decades to come. My sympathies go out to Terry's wife Lyn, their daughter Rhianna, to his close friend Rob Wilkins, and to all closest to him.""  Terry passed away in his home, with his cat sleeping on his bed surrounded by his family on 12th March 2015. Diagnosed with PCA1 in 2007, he battled the progressive disease with his trademark determination and creativity, and continued to write. He completed his last book, a new Discworld novel, in the summer of 2014, before succumbing to the final stages of the disease.  We ask that the family are left undisturbed at this distressing time.

No. I lived a good life and as a bonus i got a pretty good Death too. “ “WAS THAT A REFLECTION ON YOUR FINAL MOMENTS, A GENUINE COMPLIANT OR ANOTHER PIECE OF ARTISTIC SELF CONGRATULATION?” “Yes” “ HMM. WELL IT HAD A CAT IN IT. THAT CERTAINLY COUNTS FOR SOMETHING.” “ Well no point in delaying. Time to shove off. “ Death looked…well pretty much the same way he always did, but something about him conveyed a sense of uneasiness. “ YOU KNOW- DOES IT NOT FEEL- I MEAN TO SAY.. DOES IT NOT FEEL WRONG? DOES IT NOT FEEL UNFAIR? RIDICULOUS THOUGH IT MAY BE, I ALWAYS FELT, THAT OF ALL BEINGS I WOULD NOT EVER SEE YOU. Terry dawned a look of thoughtfulness so over the top that it was immediately nominated for every Razzy in perpetuity. “Well I suppose so, but as someone I’ve known for a while is prone to saying, THERE’S NO JUSTICE, JUST-” “US. YOU GOT THE VOICE DEAD ON.” “Oh come on now!” He cried in mock outrage. “Puns? No creation of mine should unironically be making puns.” “I WILL JUST HAVE TO BARE THE SHAME SOMEHOW”, DEATH said, as the great tale spinner walked off. “Besides I’m not dead yet! “ said the rapidly fading voice. Not unless hey’re taking my name off the books!” As the figure finally faded, Death stood in one place. And stood some more. Finally he too turned to leave.And the sands stretched on to eternity. “ I BELIEVE THE APPROPRIATE EMOTION HERE IS GRIEF” “ LET US HOPE PEACE IS NOT TOO FAR BEHIND.” “ Little something I put together to put my feelings in order."

discworld,2ysu4e,SLP_74,32,Thu Mar 12 23:03:40 2015 UTC,"I have RAISING STEAM, half-way finished, sitting on my nightstand. It's...it's been hard to read. The characters just aren't quite themselves, the style is choppy, it's...well, it was written by a man losing his faculties to the point that he had to dictate the text. I've picked it up and put it down a number of times, and it just kept making me sadder and sadder.  I think I'll try to finish it tonight, and then start reading THE COLOUR OF MAGIC again, after I have a good cry."
discworld,2ysu4e,thatgirlinthecorner,16,Thu Mar 12 16:47:22 2015 UTC,"I've been feeling really guilty about the same thing. I started Raising Steam a few months ago, and actually put it down halfway through, something I'd never, ever done to any of his books previously. I couldn't understand WHY I didn't read it through, but it seems I'm not alone in feeling weird about that particular book.  I will, of course, read it, though. Finished re-reading Feet of Clay last night and will be starting Hogfather tonight."
discworld,2ysu4e,Thelonous,7,Thu Mar 12 17:29:31 2015 UTC,"I'm glad I'm not the only one, too - I did exactly the same thing, put it down after reading the first quarter or so last summer. I picked it up again recently, and made it a lot further, but put it down again a few weeks ago and haven't picked it back up yet. It just doesn't feel right. I felt that way about DODGER, too, but I finished it. I wrote it off as being 'off' somehow because it wasn't a Discworld novel, but...yeah. I guess that wasn't the case.   I will, of course, read it, though.   Ditto. But I might need a bit box of kleenex to keep the pages from getting all blurry."
discworld,2ysu4e,Fairleee,8,Thu Mar 12 17:39:59 2015 UTC,"Upon reading it, I could tell he had planned it to be his last.  Not to say i knew he was about to die, but it felt like a goodbye to the series.  Most of the characters from every part of the series made an appearance for no reason.  It was almost a last gift to the fans.  If you look at it like this, it is a much better read."
discworld,2ysu4e,KNHaw,3,Thu Mar 12 18:59:48 2015 UTC,"I thought the same thing about it. It was choppy and not as subtle as his earlier work but it was still entertaining so I soldiered through it with no real regret. When I finished the first thought that I had about the book was that this was Pratchett saying goodbye to some beloved creations. He knew he didn't have much left to give so he gave them one last good run and let us know that it all worked out in the end. The Patrician will continue to spin his webs, Sam Vimes will continue to serve The Law as he sees best and Moist will still find a way to keep the spark he needs burning. Even Fred and Nobby will still be, in some way, inexplicably useful to have around, if only to tell us where there's a quiet spot for a smoke. Out of the wind, with good shelter from the rain and close to an all night curry house that gives a discount to watchmen. Although the expected drop in the quality of his writing saddens me I look forward to his last book, and hope that he's said goodbye to the witches in a manner that they find respectful."

Adams is best known as the author of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, which originated in 1978 as a BBC radio comedy before developing into a ""trilogy"" of five books that sold more than 15 million copies in his lifetime and generated a television series, several stage plays, comics, a computer game, and in 2005 a feature film. Adams's contribution to UK radio is commemorated in The Radio Academy's Hall of Fame.   Adams also wrote Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency (1987) and The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul (1988), and co-wrote The Meaning of Liff (1983), The Deeper Meaning of Liff (1990), Last Chance to See (1990), and three stories for the television series Doctor Who. A posthumous collection of his work, including an unfinished novel, was published as The Salmon of Doubt in 2002.

Pratchett's novels have characters that feel like real people with real lives. You can feel their impact on the world even in books where they don't appear at all or appear very little.

It was later that the story of Windle Poons really came to an end, if “story” means all that he did and caused and set in motion. In the Ramtop village where they dance the real Morris dance, for example, they believe that no-one is finally dead until the ripples they cause in the world die away - until the clock he wound up winds down, until the wine she made has finished its ferment, until the crop they planted is harvested.

discworld,2ysv26,Adrastos42,339,Thu Mar 12 17:22:13 2015 UTC,"The Hour of the Dead was when men died. And when a man died, they sent him home by clacks. Moist's mouth dropped open. 'Huh?'  'That's what they call it,' said Harry. 'Not lit'rally, o' course. But they send his name from one end of the Trunk to the other, ending up at the tower nearest his home.'  'Yeah, but they say sometimes the person stays on in the towers, somehow,' said Jim.' “Living in the Overhead”, they call it.'   Sir Terry will always live on in the overhead of reddit.   A lot of what travelled on the Grand Trunk was called the Overhead. It was instructions to towers, reports, messages about messages, even chatter between operators, although this was strictly forbidden these days. It was all in code. It was very rare you got Plain in the Overhead. But now . . . 'There it goes again,' she said. 'It must be wrong. It's got no origin code and no address. It's Overhead, but it's in Plain.' On the other side of the tower, sitting in a seat facing the opposite direction because he was operating the up-line, was Roger, who was seventeen and already working for his tower-master certificate. His hand didn't stop moving as he said: 'What did it say?'  'There was GNU, and I know that's a code, and then just a name. It was John Dearheart. Was it a—'  'You sent it on?' said Grandad. Grandad had been hunched in the corner, repairing a shutter box in this cramped shed halfway up the tower. Grandad was the tower-master and had been everywhere and knew everything. Everyone called him Grandad. He was twenty-six. He was always doing something in the tower when she was working the line, even though there was always a boy in the other chair. She didn't work out why until later. 'Yes, because it was a G code,' said Princess. 'Then you did right. Don't worry about it.'  'Yes, but I've sent that name before. Several times. Upline and downline. Just a name, no message or anything!' She had a sense that something was wrong, but she went on: 'I know a U at the end means it has to be turned round at the end of the line, and an N means Not Logged.' This was showing off, but she'd spent hours reading the cypher book. 'So it's just a name, going up and down all the time! Where's the sense in that?' Something was really wrong. Roger was still working his line, but he was staring ahead with a thunderous expression. Then Grandad said: 'Very clever, Princess. You're dead right.'  'Hah!' said Roger. 'I'm sorry if I did something wrong,' said the girl meekly. 'I just thought it was strange. Who's John Dearheart?'  'He . . . fell off a tower,' said Grandad. 'Hah!' said Roger, working his shutters as if he suddenly hated them. 'He's dead?' said Princess. 'Well, some people say—' Roger began. 'Roger!' snapped Grandad. It sounded like a warning. 'I know about Sending Home,' said Princess. 'And I know the souls of dead linesmen stay on the Trunk.'  'Who told you that?' said Grandad. Princess was bright enough to know that someone would get into trouble if she was too specific. 'Oh, I just heard it,' she said airily. 'Somewhere.'  'Someone was trying to scare you,' said Grandad, looking at Roger's reddening ears. It hadn't sounded scary to Princess. If you had to be dead, it seemed a lot better to spend your time flying between the towers than lying underground. But she was bright enough, too, to know when to drop a subject. It was Grandad who spoke next, after a long pause broken only by the squeaking of the new shutter bars. When he did speak, it was as if something was on his mind. 'We keep that name moving in the Overhead,' he said, and it seemed to Princess that the wind in the shutter arrays above her blew more forlornly, and the everlasting clicking of the shutters grew more urgent. 'He'd never have wanted to go home. He was a real linesman. His name is in the code, in the wind in the rigging and the shutters. Haven't you ever heard the saying “A man's not dead while his name is still spoken”?'   GNU Terry Pratchett"

The usual collection of litter and other substances - some of which were probably best left unexamined - had replaced the solemn march of feet. A visitor to the city would have had no idea that a funeral had just taken place... though Sergeant Fred Colon viewed the refuse as being a sign of a respect, a collective promise from the city to go on in the wake of such a terrible loss.  He sniffed mightily, as though the constant suction of air through his nose might keep the tears from streaming down his face. Beside him, Corporal ""Nobby"" Nobbs kept a pensive silence.  ""I mean..."" began Fred, seemingly in response to some inner thought, ""that's it, then, innit?""  ""What's it, Fred?"" asked Nobby.  The larger man idly adjusted his ill-fitting armor. ""It's, you know... death. It's going to happen. It's coming for us. Only a matter of time now.""  Nobby considered this. Although his brain was not particularly well-suited for the task of contemplating anything beyond the existence of jam donuts, the words from his friend had apparently dislodged something in a deep corner of his mind. The internal crack allowed just the barest glint of wisdom to shine through, igniting neural passages that had lain dormant for years.  ""The way I see it,"" Nobby replied, ""the way I see it is... well, he was dead before, right?""  Fred aimed a curious glance downward. ""How do you mean?""  ""I mean... I mean before he was born, he was dead, right?"" Nobby nodded along with his own thought. ""It stands to reason. If he's not alive, then he's dead.""  ""Supposing he was a zombie, though?"" asked Fred. It was a strange sensation, being on the receiving end of Nobby's wisdom... and yet, not a wholly unpleasant one. ""Zombies are both alive and dead.""  Nobby nodded. ""Right, Fred, right... but maybe it's like a door? On one side you're dead, on the other you're alive, and zombies don't have the decency to go all the way through.""  ""Blocking it up for all the people just trying to get outside!"" growled Fred. ""Do you suppose that's how zombies come about? Maybe they're all blocked from going outside by one fellow what won't make up his mind?""  ""Stands to reason!""  Fred pounded a fist into his open hand. ""Well, that won't do, will it! Loitering, that is! We can't have a zombie keeping such a great man from getting outside, now can we?""  ""What're we going to do, Fred?"" asked Nobby. With that question, the universe righted itself, and the glint that had struggled to shine in Nobby's mind snuffed itself out in frustration.  ""I'll tell you what we're going to do,"" Fred replied. ""We're going to get out there and get those zombies to move!""  ""Politely, though, Fred?""  ""Of course, Nobby,"" Fred answered. ""Of course. No call to go being rude about it. We'll ask politely. Maybe ask them to see reason. Tell them about our friend. Any decent person would move aside, what?""  ""Supposing they aren't decent, though, Fred?""  Sergeant Fred Colon cracked each of his knuckles in sequence, a habit he hadn't practiced since... well, it had only been last week, but this time was meaningful. ""Well, Nobby,"" he said, ""if they aren't decent... we won't be either.""  The two men puffed up their chests and continued to guard the empty street.  In the shadows behind them, the transparent figure of a bearded man grinned mischievously."

""THIS IS THE FIRST DAY OF THE REST OF YOUR DEATH. I'VE BEEN WAITING TO SAY THAT."" He added. ""FOR SOME TIME.""  Er. Yes. Very nice. Are you just here for me?"" ""I'M HERE FOR EVERYONE."" When the man looked a touch disappointed he added ""BUT ESPECIALLY YOU. YOU MADE IT EASIER FOR LOTS OF PEOPLE. ALSO FOR ME. HARDLY ANYONE COMPLAINS. THANK YOU."" He leaned in, and down, conspiratorially. ""I REALLY ENJOYED THE ONE WITH THE POST OFFICE. VERY AMUSING. NOT ENOUGH ME, THOUGH.""  ""Aha. Yes. I liked that one too. Um... so what happens now?"" Death squirmed. It looked exactly like a human squirm. ""I WONDERED... IF YOU COULD SIGN THIS FOR ME?"" White bony fingers held out a fat paperback book. With no surprise at all, the man read the title. Mort. ""Do you have a pen?"" Death fumbled in his robes for a moment and with a flourish, drew out a quill, a bead of ink ripening at the end. The man took it gingerly, opened the book and, trying not to blot, went about the business of constructing sentences with his old fluid ease. ""To our dear friend Death, for all the times you've showed up, and all the times you didn't. Your pal, humanity."" He swirled off his signature at the end, marvelling at the way it had come with him through the fog. You knew you were you when you signed your name. ""And now…?""  ""ER. THERE MIGHT BE ONE OR TWO MORE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO MEET YOU."" Death now managed to look sheepish. It was clever, really, how he'd mastered such complex human emotions as embarrassment.

My father had handed me a few of his books and every night I would read them before I went to bed. Pratchett's world wasn't an escape, like a lot of fantasy novels in those days. His worlds were real, and many of the problems his characters faced had nothing to do with epic quests and magic swords more than they had to do with people struggling to find out who they really were and what they stood for in a world that just happened to have magic swords. To someone who was going through the struggle of finding out who he really was, this resonated with me more than any series about grand clashes of good and evil.  His philosophy, his ideals, and perhaps most importantly, his humor have been ingrained in my psyche, and his books are something that helped my fiancees and I's relationship blossom into love and marriage.  I knew this day was coming, but losing him is like losing an older brother; This, incredible, shining example of a someone you want to become is gone, and there's nothing you can do about it.

It's almost silly, looking back, just how many aspects of my outlook were shaped, directly or indirectly, by his writing. I always meant to write him a letter to tell him that, I felt I owed him that much. But there was always something else that came up, some distraction that stopped me putting in the time I felt a proper letter needed, so I left it till later.   And there was always more time. Until now. This may seem selfish, and it's my own bloody fault, but it doesn't seem right that this man touched my life so profoundly, and I never even managed to let him know I exist.    Fuck.   I've been an atheist for the majority of my life (catalysed in part by the Science of Discworld 3) and this is the first time I'm pissed off about it. Because we all know that in any just and fair world, Death would play cards against Pratchett, and Death would chose to lose. But Alzheimer's, the embuggerance, exists, and it went and stacked the deck.  Sorry, this has gone on, but I needed to write something about this. Sir Terry Pratchett has gone and left the party early, and without him the world is a much darker place. He will be sorely, sorely missed.  Thanks for everything, Terry."

discworld,2ysv26,hovding,8,Thu Mar 12 15:37:57 2015 UTC,"Sir Terry got me through University. Since I began reading the Discworld series (bought Colour of Magic during a WH Smith ""2 for 1"" Sale in 2001), there's always been another Pratchett book to start after the one I was currently reading. I read so many of them on the bus.  I dipped into the other series' and I'd not call any of them ""bad books"", even the early ones (like Strata & The Carpet People) and some of the weaker Discworld ones were better than most other stuff I read. His writing style changed, but his genuine humour never did. I loved Nation, but haven't yet read Dodger or The Long Earth.  I've just started reading Snuff and I have Raising Steam after that. But after that... I don't know.  He's just always been there. There's always been something else to read, which is all you can ever hope for from your favourite writers.  :(   'Goodbye,' Mort said, and was surprised to find a lump in his throat. 'It's such an unpleasant word, isn't it?'  Qᴜɪᴛᴇ sᴏ. Death grinned because, as has so often been remarked, he didn't have much option. But possibly he meant it, this time.

IT HAS said a voice he felt, rather than heard, in a not unkind way.  He turned around and saw him. His creation. “I hoped you would come.” he looked at death. He was exactly as he had always imagined. The dark cloak, the blue eyes like distant stars on a moonless night. And in his hand was a sword. “The sword? The sword is only for kings.” He said, quite confused.  IT IS.  “You made an exception? For me?”   I WOULD HARDLY CONSIDER IT AN EXCEPTION.  “Hmmm. Well I guess we better be moving then. Where to?”  ON.  A chuckle escaped. He should have known. Despite the circumstances, he wasn't necessarily sad. “Well, in that case, lead me on.”   IT WOULD BE MY HONOUR.

They're more like old friends that I've fallen out of touch with. i like to imagine that they are still all going on adventures, getting into trouble, and making sarcastic remarks. The heroes that he brought to life are still with us, and live as a testament to the incalculable worth of one human life.  Yesterday the news of his passing had me sobbing.

discworld,2ysxt3,stevenjd,1 point,Thu Mar 12 18:20:39 2015 UTC,"With due respect to Sir Terry, it is my fondest hope that his wish does not come true, at least not forever. It is perhaps premature to be saying this so soon after his death, but Discworld is an important part of our culture, and the hands of long-dead men should not keep their grip on culture forever. Discworld is bigger than any one person, even the author. Just as Terry borrowed from writers before him, so future writers should be able to borrow from him. Some day, Discworld should become part of the shared culture of the public domain, like elves and dragons and Robin Hood, Sherlock Holmes, Jekyll & Hyde, Long John Silver, Dorothy and the Wizard of Oz. Can you imagine Maskerade if the heirs of Gaston Leroux had been able to stop Terry from writing about the Opera Ghost? Or Dodger without Sweeney Todd?  With the excessively long copyright terms in place now (and likely to get longer), it is unlikely that any of us will live long enough to see Granny Weatherwax or Sam Vimes take their rightful place in the pantheon of public domain heroes. But, someday maybe our grandchildren will do so."
discworld,2ysxt3,alexshatberg,1 point,Sat Mar 14 17:25:13 2015 UTC,"You don't seem to distinguish much between borrowing and continuing. Being inspired by Discworld, deriving themes and characters from it, putting your own spin on the stories.. by all means, I'm all up for that. In fact, there's nothing stopping you from using a Vimes-like or a Librarian-like character like now. But for the love of god, don't try to expand or rework the canon. It didn't work with HP Lovecraft's Mythos (even though he officially endorsed it), nor with E. Howard's Conan the Barbarian series. Remember the post-Frank Herbert Dune series? The Chronicles of Amber prequels after Zelazny died? try to name one literally work set in Tolkien's Legendarium not written by Toklien that can stand on its own. Hijacking another author's world like that never works."
discworld,2ysxt3,perscitia,2,Sat Mar 14 17:48:17 2015 UTC,"there's nothing stopping you from using a Vimes-like or a Librarian-like character like now.    Of course there is. It's called copyright law. If some judge, or jury, decides that what you consider to be merely ""Vimes-like"" is just a hair-breadth too close to Sam Vimes, then you have infringed copyright. You can't be ""a bit"" infringing, it is all or nothing. There's an invisible line between ""inspired by"" and ""infringing"", and unless you are a big multinational company that owns enough copyrights to have an informal ""non-aggression pact"" with other multinationals, you're always at risk that somebody might decide that you've crossed that line.  Why do you think that, after the success of Discworld, there are so few ""Vimes-like"", or ""Mac Feegle-like"", or ""Death-like"" characters? No publisher would touch a work that so obviously skirted Terry's copyrights. The risk is just too great.   Hijacking another author's world like that never works.   It's not hijacking. And of course it can work well. Think of how many great works ""hijack"" Shakespeare, starting with Wyrd Sisters.   ""Robin and Marion"", among many other wonderful versions of Robin Hood, as well as plenty of merely good or just mediocre (and plenty of bad ones too, of course -- but we don't get to say ""people should only write good stories"" - people write what they write, and we pick and choose the good ones). ""Sherlock"", on BBC television. Marion Zimmer Bradley's retelling of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table, ""The Mists of Avalon"". ""Greystroke"", an updating of Tarzan. Although it was a tad self-indulgent, Peter Jackson's King Kong. For that matter, although he had permission, Jackson's LOTR movies are so much richer and more tightly focused than the books. Christopher Tolkien hates them. Thank goodness his father already sold the rights many decades ago and Christopher can do nothing but count his royalties and seethe. Ironic that you mention Tolkien, because the movies are much better stories than the novels. So many stories and movies about Dracula or Frankenstein that I barely know where to start. Yes I do -- the National Theatre Live version of Frankenstein. Charles Stross' ""Laundry Novels"", taking the Lovecraft's Mythos and updating it to the Internet age. Alan Moore's League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. Eoin Colfer's continuation to the HHGTTG series.   Pratchett's brilliance was that he mostly took existing tropes -- the night watchman, the rightful king to the throne, the wicked old witch -- and turned them around and made them fresh and wonderful. But he also took actual characters and parodied them, especially in the early books when he was getting started, and in later books there are times where he just used them whole, e.g. Sweeney Todd. Terry didn't have to ask permission to ""borrow"" Fritz Leiber's characters and milieu and make changes to it as he saw fit, he just did it. Ankh-Morpork would not exist if Terry wasn't allowed to ""hijack"" another author's work.  But it's hard to parody a parody, and it is doubtful anyone could do the same to Ankh-Morpork as Terry did to Lankhmar.  Rhianna Pratchett, and her children if she has any, will have decades to enjoy the fruits of Terry's labour. But culture is a living thing, and Discworld has the potential to be as rich a part of British and Western cultural heritage as Robin Hood, King Arthur, Dracula, and Sherlock Holmes. It is only right and proper that someday others will stand on Terry's giant shoulders just as he stood on the shoulders of giants before him. That his works will live on and be part of living, breathing culture is the best tribute to Terry that anyone can give him."
discworld,2ysxt3,jim0thy,1 point,Sat Mar 14 19:18:07 2015 UTC,"I apologize for the late reply. If I understand correctly, your main point is that Discworld should exist in free domain, without any sort of copyright. I'm certainly not against that, even though right now that's hardly possible. My argument is against ""authorized"" continuations, and basically any kind of Expanded Discworld universe. I'm certainly not arguing against adaptations, reimaginings and ""derived"" works, just leave the canon alone. Most of your examples of literary hijacking in fact don't do anything with the canon, and I wouldn't use that word to describe them: Sherlock, LOTR and Greystroke are adaptations (and, by definition, exist in their own canon), while Robin Hood and King Arthur are folklore characters with no canon defined. the voluminous Draculas and Frankensteins usually just borrow the main character or the idea, and build their own worlds atop of it. Yeah, you can't randomly introduce Vimes or Nobbs in a publishable novel right now without drawing fire from lawyers, and that probably sucks, but I honestly don't see it as a huge obstacle. Plus, Pratchett's hugest, most popular and most memorable character is certainly generic enough to be used in any work of fiction, anywhere.   EDIT: Moore's League is actually a good example of something I'd happy see done to Disc's characters: like if somebody wrote meta-fantasy series and made Discworld a part of it. I would never in a million years consider that kind of work canon, though, the same way nobody considers the League canon to Sherlock Holmes or War of Worlds. Eoin Colfer's H2G2 novels I haven't read, so I can't really judge them. If they really do justice to the original, good for him."

There is a time and place for that and it's not now.   Eddit:  As a Follow-up to what I said.

Another 20 or 30 books? Another shelf-full of ideas and glorious phrases and old friends and new, of stories in which people do what they really do best, which is use their heads to get themselves out of the trouble they got into by not thinking? Another book or two of journalism and agitprop? But truly, the loss of these things does not anger me as it should. It saddens me, but I, who have seen some of them being built close-up, understand that any Terry Pratchett book is a small miracle, and we already have more than might be reasonable, and it does not behoove any of us to be greedy.

There was nothing but Imo.  So he spat in his hands and rubbed them together and made a ball of  sea.  After that he made some fish, but they were stupid and lazy. So he took the souls of some dolphins, who at least had learned to speak, and he mixed them with clay and rubbed them in his hands and changed their shape and they became people.  They were clever but they could not swim all day, so Imo dug some more clay and rubbed it in his hands and baked it in the fire of his fishing camp, and that was how the land was made.  Still Imo was not satisfied, and he said: I have been like a child playin in the sand.  This is a flawed world. I had no plan. Things are wrong.  I wil rub it in my hands and make a better one.  But Locaha said: The mud is set.  People will die.  Imo was angry and said: Who are you to question me?  And ocaha said I am a part of you, as are all things. So I say to you, Give me the mortal world, and go and make your better one. I will rule here fairly. When a human dies I will send them to be a dolphin until it is time for them to be born again. But when I find a creature who has striven, who has become more than the mud from which they were made, who has glorified this mean world by being a part of it, then I will open a door for them into your perfect world and they will no longer be creatures of time, for they will wear stars.  Imo thought this was a good idea, because it was his own creation, and went off to make his new rold in the sky. But before he did this, and so that Locaha would not have things all his own way, he breathed into his hands and made the other gods so that while the people should die, it would be in their right time.  And this is why we are born in water, and do not kill dolphins, and look toward the stars.    I'm guess Locaha opened up a door into Imo's perfect world today."

I do think that a Rincewind and the Librarian tale would be quite good. Something like, they're out drinking at the Mended Drum and get into a fracas (presumably because an out of towner calls the Librarian a monkey). But before the Librarian can pummel someone, they explain that they're on shore leave on the biggest floating library on the disc. This gets the Librarian's interest and he drags Rincewind to see it.  When they get in board, it turns out that it was a slaver and Rincewind and the Librarian are taken as slaves. By the time they reach the next port, the Librarian has busted out of his chains and taken command of the ship (Rincewind has been freed so that he can translate, rather badly, for him)."

Publication order is popular because it lets you skip around characters really frequently.  Generally speaking, there's several subseries, so if you really like Nanny Ogg and Granny Weatherwax from Equal Rites, go on to the next Witches books. If you really like Mort, carry on with the Death ones.  As for a recommended reading order, I suggest reading the first in each subseries one after the other so you know more of the characters. The City Watch books have the most cameos in the other series, so knowing who the Watchmen are and what they are like can be important. For reference, these are The Color of Magic, Guards! Guards!, Equal Rites, Mort, and Going Postal That said, however, I would suggest Wyrd Sisters as the recommended first Witches book instead of Equal Rites. Wyrd Sisters focuses much more on the witches themselves and introduces another witch, Magrat, who stays a character in most of the rest of the Witches books."

discworld,2y4k2z,pratchettjob,11,Fri Mar 6 11:08:38 2015 UTC,"The underlying question is whether it is right to evaluate Hogfather as JUST a novel, or should we instead evaluate it as an exploration of an aspect of human nature which happens to be attached to a plot?  The blog assumes Hogfather is nothing more than a novel without ever considering whether that assumption is fair to the book."
discworld,2y4k2z,OriginalStomper,6,Fri Mar 6 15:25:21 2015 UTC,"I'm intrigued by this, although can't quite understand what you mean. Would you mind elaborating on it?"
discworld,2y4k2z,OriginalStomper,17,Fri Mar 6 15:36:15 2015 UTC,"The blog's primary criticism is that there are many scenes which do not advance the plot.  This is a valid criticism IF Hogfather's sole (or primary) purpose is to tell an entertaining story.  This is NOT a valid criticism if Hogfather's purpose is to explore the importance of belief (in children and adults), and the plot is just one of the tools for doing so.  The blog itself seems to recognize that most every scene in the book is about belief, but the blog seems to miss the significance of this.  While Small Gods was focused on faith in deities, Hogfather focuses on belief in abstract concepts.  Even the side stories and sub-plots which do not advance the story of ""Teatime and the Auditors vs. Susan and Death"" are all relevant to the issue of belief -- what we believe, why we believe it, how beliefs originate and evolve, and why those beliefs are important.  Indeed, some beliefs (like ""justice"" and ""freedom"") are so important they might well be worth risking our lives, our fortunes and our sacred honor (another abstract belief).  Doesn't this ongoing theme throughout all of these additional scenes suggest that Pterry was trying to do something more than just tell a story?  Literary criticism these days does not care much about authorial intent, but that doesn't make it fair to criticize an apple for failing to be an orangutan."
discworld,2y4k2z,_PM-Me-Your-PMs_,7,Fri Mar 6 15:53:03 2015 UTC,"make it fair to criticize an apple for failing to be an orangutan   Utterly love this.  You make a fair point. What I was saying is that Pratchett at his best brings both together - thought provoking concepts and philosophical arguments in scenes that really drive the plot forward.  I accept your point that the other scenes do explore the key themes but I don't feel they add much to the book. They are funny and entertaining but it's Pratchett spinning the wheels in mud a bit.  I do like this book a great deal but at his best (Small Gods, Feet of Clay, Lords and Ladies), he has a much better grip on his writing and the books are better for it."
discworld,2y4k2z,masklinn,10,Fri Mar 6 15:58:54 2015 UTC,"Hogfather is a bit of a mess, isn't it? It's great but it kinda sums up Christmas for me - fun and sentimental but knackering and probably goes on a bit too long.  I LOVE Teatime and his complete lack of nuance. He's arguably the most evil villain the Discworld has seen and he's fantastic. It's a shame he disappears for a good chunk of the book."
discworld,2y4k2z,Tebwolf359,9,Fri Mar 6 11:10:10 2015 UTC,"I really liked the hogfather, espeically the Susan-Death dialogue at the end. The major gripe I have with the story is actually the Oh God of Hangovers. Although funny I think he gets way too much attention for the fact that he contributes very little to the story."
discworld,2y4k2z,HarlequinValentine,2,Fri Mar 6 14:54:47 2015 UTC,The minor Gods is a cool concept but I'd agree that it is a bit belaboured.

Before I'd re-read it a few years ago, my memories of the book were… inconsistent… fractured. I have terrible memory so I'm used to that, but my memories of Hogfather just made no sense whatsoever. It's not that I didn't remember it, it's that I remembered two or three different Hogfather books (not in the sense of a trilogy where a single story is split over multiple volumes, in the sense that there was a single name over different stories).  It's only after re-reading it that I realised the middle third of the book had no plot relation to the first and last thirds.  Then again, it makes the book as fractured as Teatime's mind I guess."

discworld,2xm09v,fezzuk,1 point,Thu Mar 12 20:33:03 2015 UTC,"Yes. I've read 13 Discworld books and most of the puns work well in Bulgarian. A cool example is the title ""Going Postal"" which they translated as ""Пощоряване"" - it still keeps the ""post"" and ""going mad"" meanings. The only problem I have with the translations is that in the last few books they started translating the full names of the characters. Before it was just pieces like the beginning of ""Cut my own throat Dibbler"", but now it's the full names. This changes the way we pronounce them completely and kind of messes your head when you are reading something in English about the books. But it helps readers with no knowledge of English to get the full extend of what Terry wanted to tell with their names so I guess it's fair."

These copies with the missing ""A"" on the spine were part of an early batch of a reprint which were never on sale due to the typo (which was spotted as soon as the first copies arrived in the office). Rather than junk the batch, we decided not to waste them (there’s nothing wrong with the inside pages) and used them as free gift to schools to introduce new readers to Terry’s books and the Discworld.  So those copies were intended to be in the hands of a young reader and be passed around in school. I’d always intended to offer a free lollipop, gold star for spelling, or something suitable for the intended age-group in the event that any eagle-eyed kid spotted the typo and took the trouble to write in. I could offer a lollipop in this case if the poster is still in full-time primary or secondary education...  Would prefer to see these copies in the hands of kids, of course.  Hope that answers the question.  Philippa"

Hogfather was their best effort, but they made the mistake of trying to please the fans by leaving absolutely everything in. They tried to cram every word of the book into the screenplay, and it shows, with the film coming in far too long to be bearable. And it made the mistake (as so many modern shows such as CSI seem to do) of picking a really extreme colour-grade and just overdoing it to the point you feel like you're watching a TV show through novelty sunglasses. And they cast Tony Robinson - Britain's most personality-filled voice - to be the voice of the soul-less auditors.   Aside from that, though, it's brilliantly done.   Going Postal was also quite well done, but some of the concepts that play out on the page in a paragraph or two of neat prose just don't translate on screen. The awesome opening pages of the novel get reduced to a joking reference or two, simply because - well - how could they do that on screen?   The other ones ... lets pretend they didn't happen."

A lot of adaptations have been in the works but never actually appeared... It's looking a little promising for The Wee Free Men, The Watch TV series and Good Omens, which are all possible future ones. There was also talk of an Amazing Maurice movie. In general it seems like Sir Terry's children's books have better luck with adaptations, I guess because they're more standalone."

He could've had a Spectrum or a C64, which were both 8-bit computers around at the time (albeit in the twilight years of their lifespan by that point) or a 16-bit Amiga or Amstrad. I had a Spectrum at the time, and that's what I imagined he was playing.  EDIT: IIRC, there's a joke - maybe it's gone in the modern version - about the back of the video game box having screenshots ""from a better computer than the one you have"". That gag is directly referencing the days when games released on the Spectrum and C64 would have screenshots from Amiga or Amstrad versions, because they looked fancier. At that point PC games were far from common - they were relegated to a single shelf in all the places I went to, compared to the shelves upon shelves of cassettes and disks for other computers - and it was rare to find a game that ran on all systems including IBM PC (as it was known back then)."

B: Its pretty disrespectful to just come out and say ""he got a disease and his books aren't good."" Feel free to not enjoy them but to tie their quality solely to a condition he can't help just strikes me as rude (and he's published more books that that since then anyway, Dodger, The Long Earth, etc.).

I'm about to reread Making Money and I think that is probably the latest novel I will bother with again. Realistically it is all downhill from Night Watch.  Long Earth is an interesting one too. Certainly nowhere near the level of a Discworld Book, but I've been approaching them more as Baxter riffing off Pratchett's ideas rather than a true collaboration.

You don't need to find flaws to justify a ranking like that, you can focus on the good parts and the books with more things you like win. That is the sort of analysis I would expect from a fan.  I also disagree completely with his criticisms of Pratchett's preachyness. Pratchett has always been preachy, the only difference is how much you as a reader notice it and disagree or agree with it, which I think is more telling of the reader than the writer. There is one scene where parralels are made between magic and nuclear waste that when I mentionned to my brother, he didn't see at all. Since I have a degree in physics and he doesn't, I see that as the reason for me picking up on it and him not."

discworld,2xnxle,tanajerner,2,Mon Mar 2 13:53:40 2015 UTC,"I think where it becomes apparent that he was clearly referencing your blog is the focus on chronological order. I understand that's how you are going about your blog (more power to you, I like the idea!) but that causes him to discount books because he's already seen certain conceits or plot devices in prior books - inherently that will cause those prior books to be ranked at the top of the list due to originality that the author feels is not present in later books. I think Terry's maturity is therefore also discounted, and clearly the other replies in this thread agree with me that the later ones are just as magical as the early ones. My two cents is that Night Watch is the best of the series, to echo an above user.  To anticipate the reply, yes I am aware that TCOM and TLF are not ranked very high despite how early they are, but the author correctly points out that the author just hasn't gotten his footing at that point, so kudos for that observation."

discworld,2xfayq,Palatyibeast,6,Sat Feb 28 22:33:31 2015 UTC,"Nation is largely about how we struggle against death as well as grief.  This necessarily involves an examination of spiritual and emotional issues.  Ermintrude and her father must cope with the death of her mother and baby sister, and Ermintrude must also cope with Cox as an agent of Death as well as the death of the ship's captain and remaining crew.  Britain must deal with the deaths caused by the flu pandemic, including the near-extinction of the royal line.  Mau must cope with the death of everyone he has ever known and loved, and (at a different level not involving grief) with the deaths of many, many generations of ancestors.  Mau's internal struggle with religious belief is the most interesting conflict.  He is angry at the Gods for letting his family/tribe be killed by the tsunami, but that means he cannot simply stop believing in the gods or he would be left with no one to be angry AT.  So Mau dedicates himself to an ultimately unwinnable fight against Death, as manifested by the god of Death.  Mau changes in how he perceives his childhood deities, but never actually stops believing in them.  His faith simply becomes more mature and sophisticated.  I really like the way Mau's internal conflict over religion is manifested through a large part of the book by Mau's interactions with Ataba.  Ataba himself is a very angry guy because his core beliefs are being challenged as well."

Stories of alternate universes that are ""the same, but slightly different"" are old by now, but the things that really make this one stand out are that they are put in a line, such that each universe only has two reachable alternates, and that humanity only developed on one.  So often, alternate universe stories end up as ""what if Hitler won the war"" or ""what if this thing was never invented"" or something. I'd never seen ""what if the entire planet was completely untouched by human hands"".  Also great is how it's handled. The long earths are just the premise, not the subject.

There were several other patricians before Vetinari (see: Night Watch establishes there was at least one between the end of that book and whenever Vetinari took control).   Anyway, I read most of the books out of order so it was interesting to read this after I had read Going Postal where Golems and Golem rights again are a big feature.  Also, one of Pratchett's most brilliantly executed parodies is in this book. The final fight at the candle factory is such a good send up of the climax of Terminator 2 in the foundry."
discworld,2xcaus,madmoneymcgee,2,Fri Feb 27 15:16:59 2015 UTC,Agree about the climax - it's an epic moment in a novel full of them.

I definitely agree that the plotting in Feet of Clay is great, it's more structured than the somewhat chaotic Guards! Guards! but less by-the-numbers than Men-At-Arms. I also appreciate the fact that the twist revolves around the method of poisoning Vetinari rather than the identity of the poisoner.

With this, you could hand it to a Discworld newbie and they would still enjoy it.  The only thing I'd say about it is I'm surprised Pratchett didn't roll Dorfl into the main team in future books. I thought the philosophising golem was amazing and a character that would sit alongside Angua and the rest. Maybe he realised he couldn't juggle everybody and make a book work. A shame.  But still. Cheery is brilliant. She's probably my favourite Discworld minor character."
discworld,2xcaus,iamtheowlman,3,Fri Feb 27 11:14:04 2015 UTC,"Dorfl is too similar to Vimes. Vimes is not a racist, he is not a speciesist. Vimes is a moralist with a burning anger. Dorfl is a moralist but a cold rationalist. Putting the two together brings up the anger in Vimes. (Which admittedly is a core of Thud.) I am pretty convinced that Vimes is Pratchett.

It's not actually water :)   The only part I'm not liking about it, is, as previously mentioned the ghosting would make a Lord Havelock Vetinari head look daft if someone held it up to the light and, it's purported to be quite a toxic process getting the ink out :(   I'd not want to make something low quality, as the rest of the game is great, bar the shitty money tokens. Found out there was a 'Collecters' edition of it that had pewter coins, but, cannot find one to buy sadly, as there was only 2000 made and no plans to make more.

discworld,2xc80g,Minky_Dave_the_Giant,3,Fri Feb 27 15:32:49 2015 UTC,"Yes, Small Gods is the one I give people. It's standalone, was written after Pratchett had found his voice, has plenty of fun silly stuff (the guy in the desert, a god who's a tortoise and so on) but is underpinned by some pretty serious philosophical points. Vorbis is a truly chilling villain, Brutha has a nice character arc and it generally does a good job of getting across what Discworld is all about without relying on pre-existing continuity.   And it's really, really funny."
discworld,2xc80g,Individual99991,23,Sun Mar 1 07:28:11 2015 UTC,"I'll probably get down-voted for this, but I would suggest ""Going Postal"".  For someone who doesn't read the fantasy genre, and just wants to get a feeling for what their son read (sorry for your loss, btw), I think the adventures of Moist von Lipwig in rejuvenating the post office is something anyone can identify with.  There are very few characters that aren't human, and it deals with concepts that everyone can understand easily.  But it also has that essential Pratchett humor and twisted sense that might just help them leap into the rest of the series.  Going with anything from the Watch, or Witches, or Death, or even - my favorite book: Small Gods - requires a reader to not flinch at silly mystical stuff like Magic, and Dwarves, and Witches, and yadda yadda.  So I say show them ""Going Postal"", and if they like it, then ""Making Money"".  THEN go back to something like Small Gods, or Night Watch.  Good luck!"

discworld,2xc80g,madmoneymcgee,11,Sun Mar 1 13:17:31 2015 UTC,"That depends a little bit upon the interests of your parents. Without further information I would go for ""Mort"", ""Guards! Guards!"" or perhaps ""Hogfather"".   In my experience there is a little problem about ""Guards! Guards!"": Either you totally like it or you can not stand it. I believe if you like crime novels and/or film noir, it is worth a shot. Otherwise I would rather pick one of the other books.  If they have a special interest in movies, Shakespeare,... another choice might be preferable.   From the information you posted, I would not pick any of the first discworld novels nor any of the newer ones."
discworld,2xc80g,ChiperSoft,3,Fri Feb 27 10:46:18 2015 UTC,I can ask them for their preferences. As far as I know they read a whole bunch of John Grisham books (so a bit on the thriller side of things). I've never seen them read any sort of fantasy novel (exept maybe the Harry Potter books since it was all the rage).
discworld,2xc80g,brightocean,5,Fri Feb 27 10:57:33 2015 UTC,"First off, I'm sorry for your loss.   I was going to say Guards! Guards! as well. My bias is that was the first book that I read because I heard about the dedication page and that intrigued me. It's a story dedicated to all of the ""expendable"" types of guards and soldiers.   It also sets up the watch novels and they kind of take on a ""noir meets fantasy"" vibe that I enjoy. And ultimately I hope your parents look to read more as well.   If that doesn't work then try ""Going Postal"" (a condemned con man is ""recruited"" to run the failing Ankh Morpork Post Office) or Wyrd Sisters which is about a coven of witches and has lots of hilarious shakepeare paralells and nods."
discworld,2xc80g,SonofBeckett,1 point,Fri Feb 27 14:50:01 2015 UTC,"I think Mort is a really good introduction. It's the first book that exemplifies the style and attitude of the rest of the series, and is kind of where tperry hit his stride.  There's nothing in Mort that requires previous reading, but it introduces a lot of characters that show up all over the place."
discworld,2xc80g,EnkiHelios,6,Sat Feb 28 01:13:14 2015 UTC,"My absolute favorite is Reaper man.  I feel like it changed the way I see the world in a profound way.  That said, it's main theme is death and dying.  It may be too much for people who have just lost a son."
discworld,2xc80g,juliet_echo_alpha,3,Fri Feb 27 16:35:54 2015 UTC,It's going to be emotional anyway (even though the books are supposed to be humerous). It's going to be confronting to read something that my brother dedicated a chunk of his life to as well as defined him in a way.
discworld,2xc80g,juliet_echo_alpha,0,Fri Feb 27 20:17:30 2015 UTC,"Death adjusted Binky's bridle, and mounted up. He paused for a moment to watch the two figures by the avalanche.

Reaper Man is the best!! My wife and I used Wherever we go, we go together as part of our vows."
discworld,2xc80g,wankshaft,8,Sat Mar 14 01:15:03 2015 UTC,"Small Gods. It's a contained story, it changed my life and how I think about morality and belief. It also has some incredible moments/lines."
discworld,2xc80g,aplantant,8,Fri Feb 27 17:18:51 2015 UTC,Definitely Small Gods. I don't consider it the most representative of the series (the City Watch novels encapsulate the universe better for me) but it stands on its own better than the others and brings up a lot of philosophical points that get to the heart of why fans love the series so much.
discworld,2xc80g,pratchettjob,2,Fri Feb 27 17:49:50 2015 UTC,That sounds good! I do assume that it still has the typical Pratchett humor in it?
discworld,2xc80g,aplantant,3,Fri Feb 27 20:14:37 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. It's subtle in its humor and a little less goofy than some of the other books, but there is a running gag about a god being constantly threatened by the prospect of unwitting humans turning him into soup, so there's that."
discworld,2xc80g,redraven,14,Fri Feb 27 22:50:18 2015 UTC,Night Watch. Guaranteed they will read more after that :)
discworld,2xc80g,redraven,13,Fri Feb 27 10:35:44 2015 UTC,"I disagree even I know some people that started with this book. ""Night Watch"" has too many small references to other discworld characters. I always got the feeling that without those references you still get a good story, but there is always the nagging doubt that you missed half of the story, too."
discworld,2xc80g,redraven,11,Fri Feb 27 10:49:52 2015 UTC,Aplantant nailed it.  I'd say Thief of Time (Small Gods and Pyramids in reserve).
discworld,2xc80g,captaincarot,4,Fri Feb 27 10:52:37 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I agree about ""Thief of Time"" and ""Small Gods"". Pyramids has the problem of the ""wild plot jumps"" in the beginning. But perhaps that is only my opinion as the first time I read Pyramids I was rather disappointed."
discworld,2xc80g,LindavL,4,Fri Feb 27 12:54:46 2015 UTC,"My personal favourite is The Last Continent, but it's probably because it was the first ever Discworld book I read.

It is polite to religion but very pointed.  Wyrd sisters is a great start for many woman as the characters are very well respected and the books are more entertaining to an older crowd.
discworld,2xc80g,Grimjestor,3,Fri Feb 27 16:30:08 2015 UTC,Small gods seems to be a good one to start! My parents are not religious so that's not a problem.

discworld,2xc80g,kataskopo,2,Fri Feb 27 22:11:52 2015 UTC,"Is there a specific thing that gets lost in the translations? Either way, it's not like I really have a choice. It's either read it in English or not reading the book at all."
discworld,2xc80g,grapp,1 point,Fri Feb 27 22:31:15 2015 UTC,"There are usually quite a lot of word-puns in the books and those can't always be translated to Dutch. Luckily, the language Pratchett uses is usually not too difficult and complex so you should be fine."
discworld,2xc80g,sexyladypants,6,Sat Feb 28 08:27:14 2015 UTC,"Monstrous Regiment.  Before it was published, I recommended Small Gods, but I've changed my heart on this.  Monstrous Regiment is, I think, the most recent piece that is totally readable without any background, and is absolutely the best of those novels.  It showcases his sardonic wit, his puns, his references to roundworld history and philosophy, his absolutely brilliant characters, and is pretty much a self-contained little package that delivers everything I love about his writing.  I know that this is somewhat anathema to say among discworld fans, but I enjoyed this book more than Night Watch"

The pommel is indented, but not pierced all the way through like a needle's eye. They would have had to beat that shape into it somehow. My guess? It's a safety pin straightened out, obviously with some copper wire wrapped around to form a grip and secure the crossbar. I'm pretty sure the hand guard piece is cut from a paperclip, those big gold ones seem pretty common. They would have had to file down the rough edges from the cut though, but that shouldn't be a problem for someone who was able to make that pommel."

One could argue that his explanations of how Octorene fuels the magics of the discworld makes it more of a science.  Typically the difference between sci-fi and fantasy is if the fantastical can be explained. Most of the City Watch books feature no magic at all and have very technical explanations for how seemingly magical things actually work."

She has a talent, finding a way to express itself through her pies.  And she has the insight into what other people are thinking.  What she doesn't have, at least in the early chapters of the book, is insight into the workings of her own mind.  She develops some as it goes on and I'd say by the end she'd be a strong candidate, but at that point she'd need to find mentors."

Perhaps the difference between the first and second readings was that in the meantime, I went through a life situation where I had quite some power, responsibility... and quite some temptation.

I am at the very beginning of Maskerade right now so I haven't formed an opinion of Agnes here yet, but already she seems like she'll be better than Magrat was."

discworld,2wjcc1,pratchettjob,4,Fri Feb 20 11:07:37 2015 UTC,"I think one of the greatest things about Maskerade is that it works so well even if you know nothing about opera. With Moving Pictures and Soul Music, Pratchett knows that his readership will be familiar with rock music and cinema so he can resort to lazy reference humour (both books do have some redeeming features, and even a weaker Discworld book is still entertaining, of course). While I'm sure there's plenty of opera jokes in Maskerade that flew over my head, they're not the main source of humour in the book.  I read most of the books out of order, so I've never really followed character development across novels, but I agree that Maskerade really lets Nanny Ogg shine instead of relegating her to the role of simple comic relief. I like Agnes but she borders on bitchy at times (justifiable given the way the opera bosses treat Christine, but it's annoying to read in parts). Salzella is a fairly standard Discworld villain elevated to greatness by his hilarious black-humour quips to Bucket each time a corpse is found. Granny Weatherwax is great as always.  What did you think of the subplot with the fat opera singer who pretends to be foreign? Ties in to what you were saying about people trying to hide their true selves, so I suppose it makes thematic sense to include it, but I found it a bit bland as Discworld subplots go."
discworld,2wjcc1,BlastedFemur,2,Fri Feb 20 12:25:49 2015 UTC,"I did enjoy it, but thought throwing him into the blog would have been hammering the point a bit too hard. He was a good supporting character - nothing more, but did a good job in underlining the themes of the book.  The annotations for Maskerade on the masterful LSpace site show just how many opera references I completely missed. I am quite the philistine!"
discworld,2wjcc1,NapoleonThrownaparte,3,Fri Feb 20 12:32:01 2015 UTC,I prefer missing references. There have been so many times I've been pleased with a creation of Pratchett's imagination only to find it was directly lifted from somewhere else.
discworld,2wjcc1,NapoleonThrownaparte,2,Sat Feb 21 10:27:00 2015 UTC,"I liked PerditaX for the simple reason that it's easy to identify with.   For all the successes of the Discworld characters and situations, there's very little that I can relate to personally or recognisably.   Vimes is consistently good for that, the protagonist of The Truth was an ordinary person with ordinary concerns. Rincewind and Mort somewhat. But mostly it's pretty ""out there"", larger-than-life characters with otherworldly concerns and magical foes. For the best, undoubtedly, but the occasional everyman is nice.  Don't know why it doesn't work for the situations themselves though. As you say, when something like rock music gets a grounded translation it's not that interesting."

So here's a list off the top of my head. I think some of these are truly inspired choices, if I do say so myself!  :-)  Vetinari - Kevin Spacey (think of his role in ""Midnight in the garden of good and evil"")  Carrot - Chris Evans (captain america - is anyone more pure and upstanding than him?!?)  Sgt Colon and Nobby - Nick Frost and Simon Pegg (respectively, Pegg probably with a nose prosthetic)  Sam Vimes - Nick Offerman. Really, who else could wear those cheap cardboard boots better?  Lady Sybil Ramkin - Kirstie Alley. Big, curvy, owns the room, and doesn't give a delicate shit what anyone else thinks.  Ridcully - Robbie Coltrane could take the inspiration of Hagrid and mesh that with a lunatic Montana outdoorsman and nail this one!  The Bursar - Alan Arkin(?). He'd be older that I'd expect, but his neurotic act would be great as the Bursar!  Granny Weatherwax - Maggie Smith. Really. Who else was Pterry possibly thinking of?!?  Nanny Ogg - Kathy Najimy. Seriously. She has been a GREAT witch in the past, is older now, and looks like nobody else.  Magrat Garlick - Kristen Wiig (think of her in the movie ""Paul""... gawky, awkward, but some sexiness underneath there)  Rincewind - Rhys Ifans or Paul Bettany, depending on whether you wanted to go totally gangly-falling-apart (Rhys), or gangly loony with a bit of charm (Bettany)  Twoflower - Jackie Chan (pure comedic role - no stunts)  Mrs Cake - Betty White would OWN this.  Death - CGI voiced by Morgan Freeman  Detritus - CGI voiced by Sam Elliott (if we can get the country twang out of his intonation)  Moist von Lipwig - Let's stick with Richard Coyle, but let him go wilder with the character. Bring more of his ""Jeff"" from the series ""Coupling"" into the role.  Adorabelle Dearheart - Can we get the 1990's version of Angelina Jolie back? I'd love to see her play her best version of goth Christina Ricci.  Cohen the Barbarian - Has to be Sir Patrick Stewart!! And I would let him cast the entire Silver Horde, from all of his actor friends!"
discworld,2wftqo,Teh_Mongoose,8,Thu Feb 19 18:32:20 2015 UTC,Pegg and Nick is genius. Id prefer Stephen Dillane as Vimes though.
discworld,2wftqo,happycj,3,Thu Feb 19 19:45:05 2015 UTC,"Oh holy crap... Stephen Dillane is an inspired choice! Although he might be just a bit too dark. Vimes is grumpy about the world, but he isn't hateful towards it... Dillane has such a dark air about him... good idea!"

So I figured Americans could pull it off..."
discworld,2wftqo,happycj,2,Thu Feb 19 22:20:35 2015 UTC,"It's just a running theater joke with British actors. You'll find many British actors will comment on how well Americans can do various English accents, and then comment that when the Brits try to speak American they too often sound like John Wayne!  :-)  The are a handful of obvious exceptions to that, but it's an old trope in the theater crowd."
discworld,2wftqo,happycj,3,Thu Feb 19 22:42:49 2015 UTC,"I pretty much agree with all of these. On Death, though, I can't really picture Morgan Freeman's voice. I'd think possibly Charlas Gray, who played the criminologist in the Rocky Horror Picture Show."
discworld,2wftqo,paganize,2,Fri Feb 20 16:12:00 2015 UTC,"I went for the humour on that choice... Morgan Freeman's voice is such a commonly used joke now (as God, for example), that putting his voice as Death would make the theater laugh out loud, I think!  Charles Gray is an interesting one, though.

I think with a bit more wild charm and just enough eccentricity he'd have been perfect."
discworld,2wftqo,Charlybob,2,Wed Feb 25 17:25:32 2015 UTC,"EXACTLY. Jeff was such a fun and eccentric character... which is exactly who Moist is!  Moist has gone through life as a chameleon. To every person he becomes what they need him to be.  So as the Postmaster, he becomes this flamboyant opposite to the dark and devious ownership of the Clacks.  But Coyle played it almost as a bumbling, hapless Moist.  In the books, the Moist I saw was much more of a crafty bastard, with a bit of a cynical side. Which plays nicely into the Jeff character, who has that clever insight into humans... but doesn't have the underlying nastiness to play on it.  More of the Jester Jeff would have made Coyle's Moist a much closer-to-the-book rendition.  I agree fully, my good man!"

For example Harry Potter is pretty well done in Dutch, as is the His dark materials series, but on the other hand the lord of the rings is pretty bad. I haven't read any of the discworld books in Dutch but based on the Dutch titles and name translations I am thinking it might even be worse than LOTR."
discworld,2wci5s,desrtfx,2,Wed Feb 18 22:22:34 2015 UTC,"The problem with Pratchett is that the books have so many puns and word-plays on words with multiple meanings that they basically cannot be translated without losing all that.  Potter and LOTR are also fine in German even though the name translations are not really necessary and lose a bit of the wits.  I've also read a couple of Dan Brown's books both in German and English and didn't find much of a difference quality-wise. Same applies for Suzanne Collins, Clive Cussler, Stephen King and plenty others. For me it's really specific to Pratchett."

discworld,2wci5s,LindavL,2,Wed Feb 18 23:26:26 2015 UTC,"Admittedly, Pratchett is difficult, but not impossible I would think. Altough probably some of the word-puns and such would get lost, translation also allows for alternative word-puns, a good translator would use this.  I quite like the Dutch name translations in Harry Potter, though realisticly speaking it does not make sense to have all these people living in England while having Dutch (sounding) names. With LOTR it is the prose itself that causes trouble, it took me ages to read the Dutch version, reading the English one was pretty quick and I had the idea that I was reading a different story (picked up quite some things that I can't remember having read in the Dutch version)."

The hat was pretty fun...it had ""WIZZARD"" picked out in blue EL wire that sort of flickered and buzzed. The letters came on in order, then blinked on and off a couple of times, but sometimes one would fail randomly for effect.  The robe I covered all over with things that I figured Rincewind might see as ""symbols of power"" to keep him out of trouble; the obvious stuff like ankhs and what-not, but also some things that a not-too-bright wizard might see in a book he can't read or a crystal ball he can't quite make out: a jumping cheerleader silhouette is the only one I remember.

discworld,2w6dws,yurt-dweller,23,Tue Feb 17 09:11:05 2015 UTC,"I feel that its something that fits Granny Weatherwax perfectly. Her character is such that she believes in doing things to the best one can, pure and undiluted dedication to a craft or passion. She also believes that ""you got nothing if you don't have respect"", a common thing she says to the other witches (Magrat) or people. By bringing Tiffany to the Trials even though the Hiver was after Tiff, she could kill two birds with one stone.   Tiffany's scenario First, if Tiffany succeeded in warding off/killing the Hiver, all the other witches around would be witness to it and Tiffany would gain great respect amongst the witch community.   Granny's scenario Next, if Tiffany failed in this task, Granny could step in and save the day in front of all the other witches, gaining respect and possiblly discrediting Mrs Earwig's way of magick indirectly.    Has witchcraft become an amateur sports league?    Throughout the Witches arc, one can see senior witches such as Nanny Ogg, Granny Weatherwax (and Miss Tick?) make comments on how witchcraft has changed. I believe that this is true; one example is the difference between Granny's meetings with other witches and Tiffany's meeting with the younger witches.   The younger witches meet more often, have more open conversations with each other (as seen from the conversation between the junior witches after Tiffany escaped from Death's realm successfully) and seem slightly more easy-going with each other as compared to Granny's generation of witches.  Perhaps with the younger witches being more relaxed around each other, they now involve family and friends or even neighbours. Granny sounds like she disapproves of this (because its pointless and flashy?) and she probably does, but she'll want an audience for her/Tiffany's showdown with the Hiver."
discworld,2w6dws,0root,20,Tue Feb 17 11:55:20 2015 UTC,"The witch trials are also mentioned in Nanny Ogg's Cookbook. It used to be witches only, and all witches were expected to turn up and show off. It's a good way to see how everyone is doing, an excuse to get as much free food as possible, and a chance to ensure that no-one's gone cackling mad. Plus, Esme likes people to know she's the best, and after the Sea and Little Fishes, I think its safe to say she'll be going to every trial. No matter how showy, until the day she dies... And probably a few more trials after that."
discworld,2w6dws,wrincewind,36,Tue Feb 17 12:53:41 2015 UTC,"The witch trials were actually introduced in Terry's short story about Granny and Nanny competing in it - The Sea and Little Fishes. It was written about 6 years before AHFOS. You can get hold of it in the Legends anthology. Perhaps it might help you to see it as more of an integral part of Discworld if you read that story as well.   Edit: as for how he came up with it, I imagine Terry just had the idea that ""witch trials"" could have a double meaning and ran with it. There's a note about it in the back of the book, if I remember rightly."
discworld,2w6dws,HarlequinValentine,0,Tue Feb 17 09:19:08 2015 UTC,"You can read The Sea and Little Fishes online for free, downloadable here among other places.  It's probably my favorite Discworld short story."
discworld,2w6dws,GodspeakerVortka,9,Tue Feb 17 20:25:13 2015 UTC,"He really did change how witchcraft works later in the series, but in a way you can think about it like the real difference is how Granny Weatherwax thinks of Witchcraft and what its actually like."
discworld,2w6dws,tgjer,14,Tue Feb 17 15:42:15 2015 UTC,"I thought the Witch Trials were supposed to parallel the sheep shows Tiffany went to with her grandmother.  Those definitely weren't ""amateur"" in any way. They were lifelong professionals coming together once a year with the only other people who could really appreciate their skills. The young shepherds would compete with each other for the recognition and respect of their elders. The old shepherds would come to watch the young, and spend time with people who shared and understood their very isolated lives. Most shepherds, like most witches, would spend most of their lives alone.  Granny Aching didn't come to compete, she came to see and be seen by the people she had immense power over. People who in some ways acted as her representatives, and who looked to her to build their self-image of what it meant to be a shepherd.  I think it's the same for the witches. The games and trials are just a pretext - the purpose of it is the gathering itself. Witches need to be made to socialize with each other, not because they want to but to keep them grounded. They understand each other, and keep an eye on each other. Granny Weatherwax is their unofficially recognized leader. She comes to see and be seen by them, both for their benefit and to give her a community who will tell her if she ever starts to cackle."
discworld,2w6dws,mattclimb,12,Tue Feb 17 13:42:58 2015 UTC,I'd agree with you there but suggest that as A Hat... is a kids book then maybe this in put in intentionally to make witching seem more appealing for children.   I also serves as a contrast to how witching is changing as the world around Granny Weatherwax changes.
discworld,2w6dws,Chimerasame,8,Tue Feb 17 09:17:37 2015 UTC,"A Hat Full of Sky was my first Discworld book -- my wife had checked the audiobook version out of the library during a time when my work left me ample opportunity to listen to audiobooks. And thus it was really my ""establishing shot"" of Granny Weatherwax. ""I ATEN'T DEAD"" sign, and everything. So, I may be a bit biased in this regard, but it seems reasonable to me for her to do it.  As the feegles say, she's the hag o' hags. Meaning, she's the witch for the other witches. A normal witch would attend a village festival to intercede in a witchly way if anything goes awry; so, stands to reason, a witch-witch would attend a witch festival for similar reasons."
discworld,2w6dws,OriginalStomper,12,Tue Feb 17 14:41:13 2015 UTC,"Pterry has never really worried about consistency from book to book.  The Granny W in Equal Rites is distinct from subsequent versions.  In Guards! Guards!, dwarves take everything very literally and do not understand figurative language.  That mostly disappears in later books.  There are other examples.  That said, I join with others here in finding Granny's participation more consistent than inconsistent with her character.  She goes to the trials every year to confirm that she's the leader the witches haven't got.  That's how she continues to assure witching is done her way, not Ms. Earwig's way.  Beginning in Wyrd Sisters, we see that she actively participates in covens.  She complains about it -- but her complaining is more to stake out a position than as a sincere objection.  It's Granny W, after all -- if she did not want to participate in the coven meetings with Nanny and Magrat, she simply wouldn't.  We also see repeatedly (beginning with Hilta Goatfounder in Equal Rites) that witches all seem to know each other, despite spending all of their time managing their ""steadings.""  This implies more travel than we have seen, or some sort of regular gathering."

In Guards! Guards!, dwarves take everything very literally and do not understand figurative language. That mostly disappears in later books. There are other examples.   I don't know if I would consider those good examples, given that they are the first in each respective series for those characters. Weatherwax hadn't been introduced prior. When a book actually focused directly on Weatherwax, it was found her personality didn't fit with what had been established in Equal Rites, and then stayed fairly consistent from then on. Likewise with Dwarves (and the guards and so forth) after Guards! Guards!  So I believe that he stays fairly consistent with books, at least once he figures out how a character/race/what have you should behave."

discworld,2vr7ql,pratchettjob,11,Fri Feb 13 11:05:11 2015 UTC,I think Rincewind works better as part of a wider group and I think this is why I enjoyed this novel a lot better than the other ones starring him.  I'm interested in people's thoughts about the Agateans. I found it to be a bit patronising and not true to Pratchett's usual tolerant way of thinking. All of the rebels are juvenile - it's a bit unfortunate.  The finale is utterly brilliant. I love the march of the (not) Terracota Army and Rincewind being stuck on XXXX really made me smile.  Thanks again to anyone who is bothering to read these posts :)
discworld,2vr7ql,madmoneymcgee,7,Fri Feb 13 11:07:12 2015 UTC,"Well, you say the Agatean empire is a mix of Japan and China. I'd refine that statement to be that the Agatean empire is a mix of Japanese and Chinese stereotypes or tropes we're used to seeing.   Now, could it still be patronising? Maybe, but I think the ridiculous movie-villain like qualties of Lord Hong emphasize the absurd here and play on the way westerners can have contradictory views (aka ""Orientalism"") about an asian-esque society."
discworld,2vr7ql,vaqari,6,Fri Feb 13 14:44:25 2015 UTC,"That's an interesting point, definitely.  What surprises me is there is the lack of ambiguity that Pratchett is brilliant at. Like how Vetinari is akin to a supervillain but the most best ruler Ankh-Morpork has ever had. Or why Vimes has some slightly unorthodox approaches to law and order but he leads a fair and just police force.  The Agateans just seem lost and sheep-like. There is no-one to challenge the assumptions of Rincewind or Cohen. It's unusual - it doesn't mar my enjoyment of the book completely but it seems less intellectually challenging than Pratchett is at his best."
discworld,2vr7ql,Jottor,10,Fri Feb 13 14:49:13 2015 UTC,"I think it didn't work quite as well as the vaguely-Middle-Eastern Klatchians in Jingo for two reasons.  Jingo directly challenged these stereotypes, making them an essential part of the mystery.  Interesting Times ignored the matter entirely to focus on class issues.  And in Jingo, we had a direct foil to Vimes in 71-Hour-Achmed.  Rincewind's foil in Interesting Times, if any, is Pretty Butterfly, and she doesn't really work that well.  She's hyper-competent but ineffectual, whereas Rincewind is incompetent and somehow still effective.  Vimes and Achmed seemed more balanced."

I wouldn't say that... in fact I'd suggest that a lot of them are just afraid of acting out in front of anyone in more power but are just like Cohen or Rincewind when not under such fear, like 6 Benificient Winds, all the Lords, the student cheating in the exams once Rincewind leaves, Red Fire-Herb's plans and deceptions, Disembowl-Myself-Honorably Dibbler, the Emperor, the Colon and Nobby-esque soldiers acting just like Colon and Nobby, etc. They just don't do it openly or to people in power because of how easy it is to be killed or imprisoned there... but the Red Army actually do - even if it's more peaceful protesting I guess, but then they're mostly children, only Two-Fire Herb and Pretty Butterfly are adults there as far as I remember, and PB is far from that as is TFH.  If anything it's better than his usual because this is actually how people act in the real world... they don't want to stick their heads above the water or rock the boat when people with more power than sense might kill them, but they will to people who are beneath them in the pecking order."

I wonder whether it would work well as a standalone novel though. I feel it's great because you know Vimes and Vetinari at this point.

I think if I was recommending Pratchett to a friend, I'd get them to read a few Watch novels first before tackling this. It's a nice reward to have :)"
