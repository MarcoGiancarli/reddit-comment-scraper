OutOfTheLoop,3e2nsx,Ultra-ChronicMonstah,88,Tue Jul 21 14:57:07 2015 UTC,Seriously.  AB made an offhanded comment when trying to come up with a fresh answer to the same hack question and ghostface threatened to have shooters take him out.  Pretty damn lame move.  /r/hiphopheads on the other hand is treating this like the coolest move ever because Ghostface himself posted it there.
OutOfTheLoop,3e2nsx,AOBCD-8663,99,Tue Jul 21 16:17:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm a bit shocked at HHH's reaction. I mean I love GFK but christ, Bronson has spent the last few years constantly saying how GF is one of his favourites and how much he respects him. He makes one boastful comment (one that sounded lighthearted) and Ghost makes a threat on his life? There's no real defending him. I don't give a shit how much of a legend Ghost is, you don't threaten a man's life, a huge fan at that, in that sorta way. I feel bad for AB, people are acting like he somehow deserves it."
OutOfTheLoop,3e2nsx,Ultra-ChronicMonstah,99,Tue Jul 21 16:22:03 2015 UTC,Wu Tang Clan aint nuthin to fuck with.

OutOfTheLoop,3e2nsx,JAYDEA,12,Tue Jul 21 18:48:49 2015 UTC,Literally a copy-paste I have from an article about the FBI documents from just earlier   The files also claim that the Wu-Tang Clan used their record label to launder money.
OutOfTheLoop,3e2nsx,link5057,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:38:10 2015 UTC,There was a rumor going around back when they were first coming up that they bankrolled their first album by running guns.  Not sure if there's any truth to that.
OutOfTheLoop,3e2nsx,JAYDEA,2,Tue Jul 21 18:50:04 2015 UTC,A lot of hip hop in the late 80s/early 90s was funded with crack money.

OutOfTheLoop,3e2nsx,hotterthanahandjob,8,Tue Jul 21 16:59:15 2015 UTC,"I just went back on. The higher rated comments have changed and are a lot more level-headed, but there are a lot of comments supporting GF. ""Action shoulda kept his mouth shut"", ""Action ain't on Ghost's level, he shouldn't have said it"", ""Action should have known better"". Comments saying that Ghost can say this because he's a dope rapper. People saying that this is incredible.  I get that these are lower level comments but they're not even -karma, so there are plenty of users that are behind Ghost threatening to kill a man over a stupid comment. And I know that Ghost ain't actually gonna send anyone on AB but it's still kinda sad to watch"

OutOfTheLoop,3e2nsx,AOBCD-8663,2,Tue Jul 21 16:54:47 2015 UTC,"I guess that makes sense. In the excitement of GFK posting directly to reddit and the prospect of new beef, glib and easy  comments about wu tang clan being nothing to fuck with are naturally going to rise to the top. I like to believe that when people stopped and thought about what GFK was saying for more than 5 seconds they realized how unreasonable it is."
OutOfTheLoop,3e2nsx,LastRedCoat,0,Tue Jul 21 17:14:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah I just read through it and most people seem to be on Bronson's side.   People are just mind blown that Ghost himself posted that video on reddit himself. I don't think there's ever been a hip hop beef that has been brought directly to this website before, so it's a pretty big deal to people."
OutOfTheLoop,3e2nsx,oh_orpheus,2,Tue Jul 21 17:23:40 2015 UTC,"It's Wu Tang man. They are, literally, nothing to fuck with. I'm not just quoting shit.   Plus it's kind of cool as fuck Ghost posted it himself."
OutOfTheLoop,3e2nsx,it1345,-7,Tue Jul 21 19:02:15 2015 UTC,"you don't threaten a man's life   Have you ever listened to rap music? Seriously, like 50% of it is just direct threats which rhyme.  I don't mind condemning people for this, but be consistent. If you don't agree with this then you need to question most rappers. Bearing in mind this isn't some artistic 'I shot the sheriff' shit, they are direct named threats."
OutOfTheLoop,3e2nsx,Skorpazoid,9,Tue Jul 21 17:05:48 2015 UTC,"I don't know what hip-hop you've been listening to if you find 50% of lyrics are death threats. For a long time it was very popular in diss tracks, but not even all of that. And I can't remember the last diss track I heard that named a dude and threatened it.  But there's a difference between two rappers going at each other with threats. With 50 and Game, both were naming each other, so while it was heated af it was kinda even footing. But that's not what's happening here. GF isn't releasing a diss track, he's uploaded a 6 minute video calling out a dude that wants no beef, in which he makes a direct threat. It's not music, it's not a part of a beef.  And tbh, there's a good chance that if Ghost had released a track threatening AB's life, it would have been criticised as well, but perhaps not to as great an extent"
OutOfTheLoop,3e2nsx,Ultra-ChronicMonstah,5,Tue Jul 21 17:19:12 2015 UTC,"He said ""I took his style and I'm doing it better than he ever did it""   Yeah but he didn't literally said that. If you watch the video it was very clear that it was a lighthearted jab. It happens all the time in hip-hop without people overreacting. And there's backlash, I get that, but GF overreacted a lot. Action should be able to make some boasts without having his life threatened"
OutOfTheLoop,3e2nsx,Ultra-ChronicMonstah,3,Tue Jul 21 17:05:28 2015 UTC,He's so far from braggadocio and lets one little line slip and all of a sudden Ghostface is threatening him with shooters.  Fucking stupid.

Maybe his voice sounds kinda similar at times but that's just genetics. Ghost hasn't put out anything worthwhile in ages and should just retire gracefully. Pulling this kind of shit just looks like a desperate attempt to stay relevant."

OutOfTheLoop,3e2nsx,Westboro_Fag_Tits,-4,Tue Jul 21 18:32:52 2015 UTC,AB doesn't have anything to stand on. That's the main issue here. A couple of mixtape and social hype doesn't mean shit.   He should know better than to say anything. It's like asking a top ten nba draft pick about Kobe. Yeah he might not have won this year but his accomplishments and your lack there of means shut the fuck up
OutOfTheLoop,3e2nsx,EverGreenPLO,17,Tue Jul 21 18:51:37 2015 UTC,"A couple of mixtape and social hype doesn't mean shit   You mean like a popular rapper?    If a top ten draft pick was immediately compared to Kobe at all times and finally said ""he's not moving as quick as I am at this point"" then he'd have a completely valid point.  Ghostface isn't making music that sounds like old school ghostface anymore and that's what Bronson was saying.  People are so precious with Wu Tang.  edit to add this quote from a 2011 interview:    Yeah, I mean at the end of the day, it’s all good because Ghostface Killah is one of the best rappers alive, so if I sound similar to the best rapper alive then that is fine. To me there is no comparison; he is a legend and I am a newcomer. If I would try and emulate with anyone it would be Kool G Rap, he is the person I look up to the most. I am not upset but at the end of the day I am my own person and no one can take that away from me.   People need to chill the fuck out. Especially ghostface.  Dude ran out of chill and that's dumb."
OutOfTheLoop,3e2nsx,AOBCD-8663,2,Tue Jul 21 16:42:08 2015 UTC,Why doesn't AB needs to watch what he says?
OutOfTheLoop,3e2nsx,EverGreenPLO,6,Tue Jul 21 16:43:20 2015 UTC,Because he has for the years he's been getting this same hacky question and he didn't say anything wrong.  He had a gentle jab at one of his heroes on a damn sports show and then that guy posted it to fucking reddit.  This is the dumbest feud.
OutOfTheLoop,3e2nsx,AOBCD-8663,0,Tue Jul 21 17:34:51 2015 UTC,"Hmm is there a reason AB gets all these questions? Similarities in style possibly? The reason he and GFK had a talk and GFK said it was cool for AB to do his thing even though it is the same flow and voice from a lot of songs?  If people think you are GFK/any other main artist when they first listen to you, is that not a valid question to be raised? If, for example people said I sounded like anybody from Wu-Tang I would be forever grateful that I've been blessed with their audience. You don't just jack another artist's style without paying respect at the least- especially to the founders of where we are now  Edit: this is off the topic of the GFK AB beef albeit"

OutOfTheLoop,3e2nsx,Tennstrong,-1,Tue Jul 21 17:33:26 2015 UTC,Almost like he thinks his newer style could benefit from a remix.  Is ghost's ego so fragile he can't take heat?  Get the fuck out of the rap game then.

But you have to realize that the Wu-Tang Clan has a pretty heavy influence on the whole rap game so it was similar to disrespecting the people who got hip-hop to the point it's at today. These threats aren't like if Jay-z came out and said he's gonna be having a bodybag for the guy or something, GFK says some real talk and doesn't fuck around.

His music has never been as mainstream as Bronson's and for that reason he's never been as big as Bronson is right now. He needs to stop being a dick.

OutOfTheLoop,3e2nsx,bunkcephus,24,Tue Jul 21 15:55:49 2015 UTC,"It's pretty common knowledge that AB sounds like Ghostface...a LOT like Ghostface. In the rap game, it's frowned upon to ""bite somebody's style"" (rip them off, copy them), especially in the Ghost's group the Wu-Tang Clan who were at the forefront of a lot of subgenres when they came out.  So you've got this guy who's been biting Ghost's style for a while, which irritated GFK since he's specifically said in the past that he hates when up-and-coming rappers do that. But as he said in his epic video rant, he let it slide because AB seemed like an alright guy when he met him, he's a Wu-Tang fan, and Ghost has his own things going on (his last couple of albums have been seriously great).  Then, when someone on national television compared AB to Ghost, AB made the fatal mistake of implying he was a better rapper and that Ghost isn't doing much anymore.  It's kind of like what would happen if Lebron James publicly trashed Michael Jordan, except imagine that Michael Jordan could still run circles around Lebron (and possibly make him 'disappear' if he wanted to). You just don't do that and expect it to go unnoticed."
OutOfTheLoop,3e2nsx,stonebone4,25,Tue Jul 21 15:53:31 2015 UTC,"Please. Their voices sounds similar, but Bronson can't help that. They rap about very different things and both have their own unique style, even with Bronson taking some inspiration from GFK. He needs to get over himself."

OutOfTheLoop,3e2nsx,stonebone4,6,Tue Jul 21 15:04:23 2015 UTC,"No doubt there's influence and inspiration, but I just think saying he sounds a ""LOT"" like Ghostface may be a bit much.

OutOfTheLoop,3e2nsx,vanquish421,-2,Tue Jul 21 15:41:53 2015 UTC,"Bronson can't help that.   Sure he can. A lot of guys mold their styles around their influences.

Whatever's left of GF's career would also end, his dumbass would go down in history as a loser and the world would keep turning. If AB didn't die AND took it to court, his career would suffer but not necessarily end. Why would it end? AB is not known for gangsta shit, he doesn't claim to be hard or anything, his raps don't revolve around being hard.  Point is that gangsta rap is (as it should be) wax-only. Street bullies have no room in an artistic environment. They are forced out because the streets aren't signing their checks. Either way, real gangstas are either dead or in jail, everybody knows that.  Cool, I'm out 'coz now I'm mad I wasted so much time on GF's senior-citizen-ass antics. Peace!"

Basically AB said that GFK wasn't rapping on the same level as he used to.  GFK made a 6-minute diss video ripping on AB and put it out on Youtube.  The HHH community was split, some saying that GFK is a legend and AB shouldn't have said that, while others point out that AB has been nothing but respectful in the past, including calling GFK one of the greats 5 seconds before he compared GFK's work from different parts of his career, and the GFK was blowing things out of proportion."

It takes some ego to walk into a freestyle battle and say, ""I'm better than you, and here's why.""  I do think GFK lost his perspective.  AB was saying, he's a legend, but this piece of work isn't as good as that piece of work.  Like you said, you do creative work, you've gotta deal with constructive criticism.  Especially since hip hop fans are pretty fucking savvy to quality music.  It's not like you're marketing to Justin Bieber fans."

So because of that, there are a ton of yearly subscriptions that renewed today from people that have had their gold subscription from the very start.

OutOfTheLoop,3dxzdu,mikelj,26,Mon Jul 20 17:45:54 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I'm not sure if that's true. I've been a gold member since the beginning and I have 6 months 18 days left. Maybe there was some kind of gap or I reupped early?  Edit: Apparently so!"
OutOfTheLoop,3dxzdu,Marx0r,68,Mon Jul 20 20:31:42 2015 UTC,"Maybe someone has gilded your comments a few times, pushing back the renewal date?"

OutOfTheLoop,3dxzdu,mikelj,3,Mon Jul 20 15:32:04 2015 UTC,Yearly (365 days) vs maybe 31 days added or something
OutOfTheLoop,3dxzdu,Hidesuru,2,Mon Jul 20 15:46:55 2015 UTC,"You're an unbroken charter member. Did you donate before they announced the price of gold? IIRC, reddit gave the initial gold pro-rated to the size of your initial donation."
OutOfTheLoop,3dxzdu,sharleygood,3,Mon Jul 20 19:23:49 2015 UTC,Hmm. Maybe so. That's probably the best guess.   Edit: So the math works out to 3.996 + 18/303.99 = $26.54. Or ((365/2)+18)*(29.99/365) = $16.47 Maybe some variation thereof.
OutOfTheLoop,3dxzdu,Hidesuru,26,Tue Jul 21 02:28:09 2015 UTC,Wait people buy themselves gold? As a yearly sub? Why?! It's so pointless!

OutOfTheLoop,3dxzdu,Froggypwns,28,Tue Jul 21 18:14:42 2015 UTC,"I like how it adds features to the site like displaying more subreddits on front page, and highlighting new comments since your last visit to the page.

OutOfTheLoop,3dxzdu,kokirikid,18,Mon Jul 20 19:34:17 2015 UTC,I like being able to categorize the stuff you save.  I wish that was a feature in Res.
OutOfTheLoop,3dxzdu,Froggypwns,7,Mon Jul 20 16:36:15 2015 UTC,I would only buy reddit gold if they added two features. Ability to change username and ability to delete PM's. Both of which would probably be easy to implement.
OutOfTheLoop,3dxzdu,theunnoanprojec,8,Mon Jul 20 17:11:56 2015 UTC,"I would love better PM management, even the ability to search them.

OutOfTheLoop,3dxzdu,Hidesuru,5,Mon Jul 20 18:00:45 2015 UTC,Couldn't you just go to your submitted tab and nor have to sift through comments?
OutOfTheLoop,3dxzdu,j1mb0b,6,Mon Jul 20 18:06:51 2015 UTC,"Yea if it is something I know I submitted, it is not that hard for me to find (I'm not a huge submitter), but for comments, if I am trying to find something I said about Batman late last year I am forced to ctrl+F and type batman, and hope I find it after going back a hundred pages. That also means I have to have typed batman and not bat man or some other typo like betman. Sometimes I can use Bing or Google to help narrow it down but that can't be relied upon.  Edit - Just had a situation where I was trying to find a PM from someone 3 months ago, had to ctrl f and luckily found him on the 3rd page, would have loved to have done a search like I can in my Outlook.com inbox."
OutOfTheLoop,3dxzdu,Hidesuru,3,Mon Jul 20 18:33:06 2015 UTC,The batman/betman thing gets even more confusing if you subscribe to /r/hockey.
OutOfTheLoop,3dxzdu,codeverity,7,Mon Jul 20 18:38:24 2015 UTC,I see. 99.9999% of the time I'm on relay for reddit so I think I'd get next to nothing out of it. I have no interest in the gold lounge or whatever.

Common targets for these claims commonly involve specific online communities or fandoms.  Also Aspie Urban Dictionary   An aspie is one who has Asperger's Syndrome, which is believed to be part of the autism spectrum. Aspies, while being quite gifted verbally, have social, emotional, and sensory integration difficulties, among others. Aspie is an affectionate term, and is not meant as a put down.  My son is an aspie, so he's not so great at making idle chit chat at parties, or even at being in crowds, but he can get us home from anywhere. He says he just consults the map in his brain.

OutOfTheLoop,3dyxnx,random12356622,18,Mon Jul 20 18:49:25 2015 UTC,"It's really not very different from using ""retarded"" as an insult. Both words describe legitimate mental conditions, but get used as an insult to essentially say ""you are mentally substandard."" Usually when people throw around the word ""retard"", it also isn't being applied to someone exhibiting the actual characteristics of mental retardation.  Certainly, part of it seems to come from Asperger's being pulled into the autism spectrum. Asperger's has been used for much longer as a way to offhandedly characterize the stereotypical neckbeard, and autistic seems to have been a natural escalation. Oftentimes when a term becomes overly common and loses its teeth, people will escalate to a similar term that is perceived to mean the same thing, but even moreso (that's also one of the reasons that people add ""literally"" to everything -- it's perceived as increasing the extremity of what you're saying)."
OutOfTheLoop,3dyxnx,GeekAesthete,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:29:30 2015 UTC,"More than just wanting to use a more biting term, another aspect related to the replacement of retard with autistic is the concept of a 'euphemism treadmill':  Basically as something unpleasant is used repeatedly, it becomes too closely attached to the unpleasant concept and gets replaced with a new euphemism which has less stigma attached to it.  The word for toilet is a common example.  More relevantly retard came about as a way to get away from terms like idiot or moron which used to have specific meanings about someone's intellect but which were also being used in a derogatory manner due to the stigma attached to them.  Then retard got phased out to mentally challenged for similar reasons as it became an insult.  Now that retard is largely unacceptable as an insult towards someone's intellect/mind, autistic seems to have filled that gap(not sure why mentally challenged was skipped over). In a decade or two autistic will likely become too taboo to use as an insult and be replaced with something new.  (If you're wondering why this matters at all regarding insults, consider that you'd never call someone a 'damn kike' for 'jewing you out' of your money.  Well, unless you're an antisemite, but that's beside the point.  The point is that some insults are considered to touch on too sensitive of a nerve.)"

People often have ""never heard"" of things are have been around forever.  Why: None of the following makes improper usage of the term 'autistic' kind, classy, fair, accurate, or politically correct; but if you really want to know why, here goes:  Ask yourself this, as silly as it might sound at first: Why did you use neckbeard in ""insulting manner?""  Does having hair on your neck and not shaving it make you an asshole? No, but people relate unshaven neck hair with bad hygiene and bad hygiene with bad behavior. It's a tenuous connection, but you still made it. Oh, you also threw in some fat shaming too. Well done!  Similarly, Autism is related to a lack of social skills and a lack of social skills is related to being an asshole.  They're all social stigmas that are not fair, but you don't personally know any nice fat people with neck beards I guess, or you arbitrarily decided to draw a line between what unfair generalizations are okay and what ones aren't.  As it turns out, everyone does that and no one agrees on where to draw the lines. Currently, language is moving towards increased political correctness as people are constantly being lynched on social media now.  There's more to it as well. Contrary to popular belief, calling someone autistic is not necessarily an insult to people who have Autism. It can mean ""stop acting autistic when you aren't actually autistic"", as in, ""some people have an excuse, but you're just an asshole"". This usage actually relies on the implicit understanding that the person is accepting of others who are legitimately autistic.  Lastly, some people are just dicks and want to be mean.  tl;dr Language sucks and everyone becomes a hypocrite and offends others sooner or later. Try not to be too judgmental unless you really know that someone is intentionally trying to be cruel. Or don't! I'm not the boss of you!"

OutOfTheLoop,3dyxnx,The_Phantom_Pain,7,Tue Jul 21 02:46:18 2015 UTC,"Hi, guy with Autism/Aspergers here.   From what I've been told by doctors over the years: Aspergers WAS part of the Autism spectrum at one point in time. I specifically remember having to go to the doctors and having to go to court when I lost certain parts of my disability benefits, because medical definitions changed at some point in time separating the two for reasons that I really don't care about. I don't technically heavily display the symptoms of Aspergers anymore, but it's not something that I can just get rid of. Whether any of this is actually true, I'm not sure. I pay little attention to the Autistic community for personal reasons.  Now, on to the question: As other people have said, Aspergers seems to be the main cause of this discretion. Whether or not it has anything to do with Autism is complicated. I think, more than anything it's the pronunciation of ""Aspergers"" (Ass-burgers) combined with the general easiness of getting away with calling somebody autistic as an insult.   The problem, more or less is that people don't really understand Autism. Where it comes from, if it can be cured, how it's actually cured...nothing. It's all just social therapy that sometimes doesn't and (in my case) does work. Other mental ""disabilities"" have explanations, and person that is being made fun of being helpless from the insult.   Autism, in it's huge broadness (I've met people who've been everything from completely mute, to just a little less functioning than myself) means that people may or may not be able to defend themselves. And, people ""diagnosing"" people as having Autism because of something socially wrong that they do is very common.   Basically, people don't understand Autism/Aspergers. And, the main problem is the generalization of the whole idea. People can be low functioning to high functioning (I am by far the most high functioning person with Autism I've ever met) which means that anybody can have Autism.   You can't tell a kid not to make fun of somebody for having Autism, because there is no way for them (especially if they are are high functioning) to tell unless a diagnosis is performed. You can conversely, tell a child not to make fun of somebody for insulting somebody for being mentally ahem retarded, because there are often visual cues to pick up on, as well as more simple forms of diagnosis. Autism winds up being more of a ""guessing game"" based on assumptions from people who don't understand.   And, if they make the assumption, that doesn't fly either because it can be considered insulting as well. It's a no win situation. Personally, as much as I try to ignore it. I find problems with the whole thing.  Edit: Sorry if I said anything insulting. I really don't know much about how this all actually works, I just felt an inside perspective would help make sense of this whole thing."

OutOfTheLoop,3dzfa0,D3rptastic,37,Mon Jul 20 19:49:58 2015 UTC,"Gawker published an article alleging that the Chief Financial Officer of a company had contacted a gay escort for sex.  The CFO has a wife and kids, and the article had no real value.  He's not really a public figure and there was no real reason to write news about him.   Backlash at Gawker apparently outing a closeted gay man for no reason followed immediately and people were pissed.  Gawker then posted a defense of the article stating something to the effect of ""if we find dirt, we're gonna publish it because fuck everyone else.""  Which just added fuel to the fire.  Eventually they took down the article and apologized.  Two of Gawker's head editors resigned today."
OutOfTheLoop,3dzfa0,shogi_x,30,Mon Jul 20 21:18:51 2015 UTC,"This explanation is missing a couple key facts. The article was removed by Gawker's managing partnership, not the editors. The head editors who resigned did in protest of the article being removed."
OutOfTheLoop,3dzfa0,KillerPotato_BMW,6,Mon Jul 20 21:42:17 2015 UTC,Can you explain the difference? Does it boil down to owner versus manager?
OutOfTheLoop,3dzfa0,annoyed_freelancer,21,Mon Jul 20 22:32:37 2015 UTC,It's actually closer to labor v management. Editors are concerned with the content published being newsworthy. The managing partners are concerned with making the site(s) profitable which means keeping advertisers happy.  The editors felt the story was newsworthy and wanted to keep it up. The managing partners wanted the story pulled for apparently advertising reasons. This is something most journalists see as an ethical breach of the firewall between journalism and advertising.  Which is why they quit.

An even less charitable interpretation is that they did so to aid a blackmail attempt. As a result, everyone is pissed off at Gawker.   In an attempt to stave off complete suicide, Gawkers head of legal and owner pretty much made them take the story down. Tommy Craggs (Executive Editor) and Max Read (EIC) both resigned in protest, stating that they can't ""guarantee Gawkers editorial integrity"", since Legal can go over their heads in an attempt to keep their lack of actual integrity from landing them all in front of a judge and jury, and Nick Denton is uninterested in baiting even more lawsuits when the Hulk Hogan trial is coming up."

I'm no expert and don't remember everything they said so hopefully someone can help elaborate.    From what I understand, music has been released on Fridays in places like Asia while North America had to wait until the following Tuesday. Before the internet this was never a problem but now, songs and albums are being leaked online after being released on Friday. To combat this, North American record companies decided to change the standard release date over here so everything is released at the same time."
OutOfTheLoop,3e1vln,huntergreenhoodie,2,Tue Jul 21 13:28:32 2015 UTC,"For fun - the reason music and other home media (like movies) have always been released on Tuesdays in the US:   Releasing on Tuesday, the artist/studio get a full week's credit towards ""opening week"" sales that includes an entire weekend. Releasing early in the week generates buzz for those going shopping over the weekend. (1 & 2 really go hand-in-hand here). If something was a bigger seller than anticipated, retail distributors are better primed to deliver new stock just before the weekend (when it's harder to receive trucks and stock shelves).    As you can see, many of these don't really apply in an age where fewer and fewer people purchase their music and movies digitally. So that made it even easier to change to go with the global flow and switch to Fridays."
OutOfTheLoop,3e14n7,donniesf,4,Tue Jul 21 03:48:26 2015 UTC,"There was a rather major supreme court decision recently in the form of Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs et al v. Inclusive Communities Project, Inc. basically this means that intentional discrimination is not necessary for a finding under the 1968 Fair Housing Act. this leads to a much more statistics driven approach to housing. ""Disparate impact"" is the word of the day as policies could affect one group more than another group and failures in these policies could harm blacks, whites, or whatever minority in question exists.   He cautioned, though, that ""disparate impact"" claims don’t simply arise any time statistical disparities appear along racial lines in housing. It must be clear that housing policies caused that disparity, and that those policies don’t serve another valid goal.   This could lead to developments of multi-family high-rise low income housing developed in suburbs. This was previously denied due to zoning, but apparently, not wanting to live near section 8 housing is now discriminatory.   You are unable to get public benefits if you are a felon. And it's also highly likely that you will be unable to live in section 8 housing if you are a sex offender as children are present."

I put that in quotes because I think it was the original Reddit and was later turned into a subreddit when that idea was created. But that predates me.  So whenever you posted to reddit and didn't choose a specific sub it would go to /r/reddit.com by default. You could consider it something of a general forum as well as some meta discussion. As the other subs got bigger it became less and less common for people to post there, so posts were more and more likely to be an accident. Three years ago it was shutdown as it no longer served its purpose.  /r/reddit I don't know about. Perhaps it's a reserved name that never had content and was marked banned to prevent someone from taking it and causing confusion?"

Same type of reason they would delete r/delete and subs of that nature that would expose the censoring. Reddit has been censoring shit for a while now and they always give bullshit reasons. Lawyer speak. You encounter it when you hit into the nitty gritty of how reddit operates.

OutOfTheLoop,3dvhqx,kateh01,2,Mon Jul 20 14:25:21 2015 UTC,See but I see that as a bullshit reason. We start getting words like spam or against sub protocol. It's just lawyer speak to justify censoring. If they are obviously censoring they aren't gonna say they are censoring. Get it?  It becomes impossible to call out censoring because a team of lawyers will come in an explain to you exactly what happened in a convoluted and murky manner.
OutOfTheLoop,3dvhqx,Pazians,2,Mon Jul 20 15:02:07 2015 UTC,"I don't see how it's lawyer speak. None of those words are legal terms used in official settings. They're just terms that are common when you're a mod. By ""sub protocol"" do you mean the rules on any given sub?  If there are ten posts that all use the same article from the Washington Post, then 9 of them get removed. So you're right, that isn't spamming but it's a bunch of repeat posts that can clog a smaller sub or divide the conversation on a larger sub.  I really can't say anything else without accusations of ""censoring"" you so we'll just have to leave it at that. I recommend starting a private sub that only you have access to so you can familiarize yourself with mod tools and moddiquette."

OutOfTheLoop,3dywb0,TalenPhillips,12,Mon Jul 20 19:42:52 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming it's no longer about Zoe Quinn, and just about ethics in journalism. If that's true, why does everyone shit on r/KiA?    People shit on r/Kotakuinaction for a variety of reasons.   One: it's an internet fight for the most part, so plenty of people do the whole XKCD ""At least you found a way to feel superior to both"" thing.    Two: Plenty of idiots are outright convinced it's still all about harassing women and poor Zoe Quinn, whom it hasn't ever been about, because when the Zoe Post first dropped, assholes ran amuck (GamerGate as a group showed up later).   Three: KiA is against media corruption, and the media is doing the reporting on KiA, so they try very hard to paint a picture of GamerGate that is a ridiculous parody of reality. I recommend checking out our wikipedia page. Last I heard, they were trying to add accusations of terrorism to the GamerGate wikipedia page.   Four: KiA is accused of racism because we don't care what race you are, just as we're accused of sexism because we don't care what set of reproductive organs you have. Yea, you heard that right, we're a bunch of racists because when Martin Luther King gave his ""I have a dream"" speech and said ""I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character"", we thought ""hot damn, that's the kind of nation I want to live in!"" Exactly how this makes us racist, I couldn't tell you.   Five: KiA is accused of harassment because people make incredibly stupid public statements, and GamerGate is willing to call bullshit and mock their statements.  Six: Fallacy of relative privation. There are more important things in the world than the state of gaming journalism. Frankly, most people are comfortable doing nothing, and people rocking the boat scare them. The fact that they don't care about what people are rocking the boat over makes them angry at us. We get a bit of invective along the lines of ""what about starving children in Africa?"", but from people who never before thought of actually doing something for starving children in Africa."
OutOfTheLoop,3dywb0,ezaviar,5,Mon Jul 20 21:33:58 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming it's no longer about Zoe Quinn, and just about ethics in journalism.   It has always been about this. I don't identify as GG or anti-GG, but looking at the GamerGate wikipedia page is literally frightening to me. There has been some extremely heavy-handed revision of what actually happened.  I was active on reddit when the story broke. The reason it was a scandal that anyone cared about was because Quinn was being endorsed by the journalists she was accused of having intimate relationships with. Some people absolutely went too far in their criticism, and used terms like slut and whore. There was some doxxing going on as well. 4chan had a tantrum... of course, 4chan has tantrums about everything. /r/gaming and /r/games lit up with posts about what was happening. In retrospect, I think a lot of people were still angry about how Anita Sarkeesian chose to misrepresent gaming and gamers. They let their anger vent by reacting way too strongly to the Zoey Quinn scandal.  And then all discussion about the topic was completely deleted. Not just on Reddit, either. 4chan banned discussion of GamerGate (which is amazing by itself). Not just the vitriol. EVERYTHING. People were accused of doxxing and punished for even mentioning Quinn's name. All conversation was suppressed, and shadowbans were handed out liberally. Everyone who wanted to actually have a conversation about how fucked up it was that developers and journalists were literally in bed with each-other was labeled misogynist and hateful. Those who wanted to continue the discussion had to go to fringe subreddits like /r/KotakuInAction to do so.  ...and the articles. Oh god the articles. Articles with headlines like ""Gamers are Dead"", ""The End of Gamers"", ""A Guide to Ending 'Gamers'"", and ""The Death of an Identity"" popped up simultaneously from a variety of different gaming journalism outlets (the ones I mentioned were published on the same day). Implications came out later that there was collusion between these outlets to cast the story in a particular light. All I could think at the time was how horrifying it all was.  I've been a gamer long enough to remember when being interested in games would get you a number of undesirable labels (nerd, dork, and geek used to just be insults). The week after the gamergate scandal broke was a very sad time to be a gamer, as I watched as those who identified as gamers were once again portrayed as social outcasts.  EDIT: It's pretty entertaining to watch the points on this post and its responses. I've never seen an entire conversation oscillate between positive and negative so frequently.

I've never understood the fascination of GG and anti-GG personalities with him. Is it because he has constantly advocated for ethics in journalism since long before GamerGate? I'm not entirely sure.  The claims of harassment are just lies cooked up by the anti-GG movement in an attempt to discredit TB. The tweet from Rowan Kaiser stirred up enough controversy that TB himself has responded (the tweet is quoted near the beginning), and Ian Miles Cheong just now apologized for harassing TB last year.  For reference: this is the original post that brought all of the hatred of the anti-GG crowd down on TB's head. The post is a summary of what was known about the Zoey Quinn scandal at the time (with a number of reminders that it's all hearsay), along with a plea for those discussing the scandal to calm down."

I'm not sure why he's famous, some people say he's funny others say it's because he's attractive.   Anyway, Carter Reynolds(age 19) had his icloud hacked and had a video of him with his girlfriend Maggie Lindemann(Age 16) leaked on the internet. In the video Carter is in a room with Maggie and they're messing around.   I'll leave the video here so you can interpret it as it isNSFW  So you can see she states she's uncomfortable and he says ""just do it"" among other things pressuring her. Interpret it how you will, I'm just trying to keep it neutral, but those are the facts, she says she's uncomfortable and he insists.   There's two sides of the argument. Let's call them Anti-CR and Pro-CR.  Anti-CR: These people think Carter Reynolds forced a minor to having oral intercourse with her, they say it is illegal and is considered rape or sexual assault. So they're giving Carter flak for this and telling him to apologize and some are even telling him to turn himself to the police. Of course, there's always those who just hate him to hate him.   Pro-CR: These are the fans, they defend Carter by saying it's what couples do, and that she was being flirty so it wasn't rape.   What has Carter Reynolds said: https://twitter.com/carterreynolds/status/613366192850530305   TL;DR he's apologizing but justifying himself by saying it's what couples do and that he did nothing wrong. Basically, ""I'm sorry you're offended"".   This pissed off a lot of Anti-CR because they claim he's not being sincere and thinks he can dismiss this.  What about Maggie: Maggie is currently in the hospital because she tried to harm herself over what happened.   Did Carter Reynolds notice/what did he say about Maggie's hospitalization: https://twitter.com/carterreynolds/status/622970873188761600 Nothing to say about his tweet, you can interpret it as you want.

OutOfTheLoop,3dyh4r,utterlygodless,11,Mon Jul 20 15:49:08 2015 UTC,"Netroots Nations Keynote Discussion on Saturday  Netroots Nation is an annual conference for progressives. Among the many events, panels, discussions, etc. that were being held at this multi-day conference was Saturday morning's keynote event. It was to be a discussion between Jose Antonio Vargas and two liberal presidential candidates: Martin O'Malley and Bernie Sanders. Each candidate was to get an hour to talk to Mr. Vargas individually and O'Malley went first.  During O'Malley's portion of the keynote event, Black Lives Matter activists (many who were already at the Netroots Nations conference for their own events) appeared, interrupting the event, and confronting O'Malley. For further context, the BLM movement (and many minorities in general) feel like politicians are not addressing issues important to the black community (especially the current events in which minorities are repeatedly dying at the hands of the police) while relying on them as a voting bloc and would like this to be a major topic of conversation in the upcoming election. Some of the chants were ""Black lives matter"", ""What side are you on my people? What side are you on?"" and ""Say her name"", a hashtag that has come up to bring focus to the female victims of police brutality that have been ignored. In his attempt to respond, O'Malley said ""Black lives matter. White lives matter. All lives matter"". This led to booing from the protestors (as all lives matter is used to ignore, derail, or detract from the black lives matter conversation) and a few of the activists were allowed on stage to speak. Martin O'Malley later apologized for this statement.  When O'Malley's hour was up, Bernie Sanders appeared for his portion of the event. The 2 activists were no longer on stage at this point but the protesters were still in the crowd. Sanders started into his regular talking points and the protesters shouted to force him to address their concerns. Sanders spoke briefly about youth unemployment being a larger concern in minority communities than and white communities, ending with ""And in my view maybe, just maybe, it is time we invest in jobs and education not in jails and incarceration"". This was met positively by  the crowd. When he attempted to pivot back to his regular talking points, the protesters started up again. Vargas and Sanders attempted to ignore them for a while and then Sanders said ""“Black lives of course matter, but I have spent 50 years of my life fighting for civil rights and if you don’t want me to be here that’s OK”. The event ended soon after.  Sanders portion of the event was significantly shorter than O'Malley's but the focus has been on Sanders as he is the larger candidate.  1 hour video of the entire Netroots Nation Keynote event  Social Media Response  The response on social media varied depending on what side the individual was on. Throughout his campaign, many of Sanders' supporters have held up Bernie's history of marching with MLK (participating in the Million Man March) or being given a 97% score on the NAACP in 2006 as evidence that Bernie will be good for minorities as president. Many minorities on social media don't weigh this the same way. 250,000 people marched in the Million Man March and many others marched in Selma or participated in the Montgomery Bus Boycotts or similarly can claim some involvement in the Civil Rights Movement. Moreover, this was 50 years ago. Younger candidates can normally provide some evidence of fighting for civil rights or the minority communities even though they weren't around for the Civil Rights Movement. That does not mean that they would be good for minorities if they were to become President of the United States.   Similarly, those same NAACP report cards from 2006 rate many other politicians highly (Hillary Clinton at 96%, Biden at 100%, Pelosi at 100%, Obama at 100%, etc.) and don't see this as sufficient evidence either. Some also question the value of using NAACP scores at all, because 1) 2006 was a decade ago and 2) the NAACP has been losing influence among the younger generation.  For many minorities on social media, they saw this as a chance for the candidates to provide some clarity on how they intended to help minorities. Sanders in particular has faced criticism of framing the conversation as purely an issue of economic inequality since he announced his candidacy. To many, this ignores the issues of racism and discrimination that they see. They see the Netroots Nation event as him ignoring issues that are important to them. And since many already believe that Democratic politicians take the minority vote for granted, this was doubly disappointing. Some expected a candidate whose civil rights track record is consistently brought up to be more willing to engage with members of the BLM movement and speak on civil rights issues. Sanders' supporters argue that the protesters didn't allow him to respond properly and disrupted the event. They question the efficacy of the BLM activists engaging in this way. They believe that him not engaging with them does not in any way detract from his other work.  The #Berniesoblack hashtag  As mentioned earlier, Bernie supporters have repeatedly brought up Bernie's participation in the Million Man March whenever his position on race issues is questioned. Some Bernie supporters have actively promoted the idea that minorities are not voting in their best interests by voting for someone other than Bernie Sanders. In response, the #Berniesoblack hashtag was created over the weekend to push back at and mock supporters who are repeatedly bringing up what they see as insufficient evidence for Sanders to have earned their vote.   The backlash to the Netroots Nation event has already sparked some changes in the conversation by the candidates. As mentioned earlier, Martin O'Malley spoke on several panels and booths at the Netroots Nation conference after the event that caused the controversy in which he apologized for his remarks and went on to talk about his background and interest in helping the black community. Bernie Sanders tweeted about the BLM movement and worked it into his speech in Houston the next day. Hillary Clinton (who was not at the Netroots Nation conference) has responded on Facebook  TLDR: Black twitter doesn't think Bernie Sanders has adequately addressed the issues important to them so far and see his actions over the weekend as further evidence of this. #Berniesoblack hashtag was created to push back at Bernie's supporters who they feel are providing insufficient evidence that Bernie will properly represent them while silencing any questioning of Bernie Sanders's stance on racial issues.

It's more of a joke rooted in annoyance. Hard to explain - he's a relative unknown in the black community (he's a senator from Vermont), and the one thing he and his supporters always talk about (when it comes to race issues) is that he marched in the million man march. i think it kind of got annoying that the supporters think that this is enough of a resume' for a presidential candidate to win over black voters on the race issues. So they turned #berniesoblack into a joke.   i'm sure i'm not explaining it right - someone will be along shortly, i'm sure."
OutOfTheLoop,3dyh4r,dripdroponmytiptop,14,Mon Jul 20 16:26:36 2015 UTC,"the TLDR is this-  the outrage isn't about Bernie, it's about the position of his overly white, straight male support group that has been alienating, silencing/talking over, and not making any sort room for the voices of the people Bernie himself is vying to uplift and have heard. Bernie's supporters aren't really acting like they support these things Bernie himself stresses, and people are laughing at the dichotomy going on.  Thankfully though when this was brought up extremely frankly and straight-up in the subreddit, the reaction wasn't the average redditor ""FUCK YOU I'M NOT RACIST RAGGHHH SJWS!"" shit as normal, surprisingly I saw a whole lot of ""oh, wow, really? damn, I better reflect on this and begin listening, that's how we learn best. We're all here to go forward, and listening to the marginalized is what we need to do, to do that. What do you all have to say?"" which was astonishing and really does bode well for the Bernie fans, whose reddit userbase are a pretty massive group."

OutOfTheLoop,3e0zsf,Suchthefool_UK,4,Tue Jul 21 03:05:44 2015 UTC,"The only thing I can answer is this -    How is he allowed to continue to run when the party isn't happy with him as a selection?   Because there's nothing stopping him.  There is no legal way to prevent him from running.  He is a registered Republican.  He's paid the Republican Party however much he has to pay to get on the Primary Ballot in all 50 states.   The Primary Elections are held January through June in various states - whichever Republican candidate wins those will be the one selected as the Republican candidate for President.  Now, once the Primaries happen, assuming he doesn't win, he can no longer run as the Republican candidate.  He can, however, run as an Independent.  Provided he pays the 50 states the various amounts of money needed to be on the ballot.  It is also important to note that, for the most part, until he started talking shit about McCain, the Republican Party was pretty quiet on their approval of him, leaving many to assume that Trump is just saying what Republicans tend to think."
OutOfTheLoop,3e0zsf,SecondTalon,2,Tue Jul 21 05:12:51 2015 UTC,"Early in campaigns name recognition is the number one factor in determining how high a candidate ranks in opinion polls. Trump is by far the most recognizable name. He's been in the news for several decades. He's written bestsellers. Was the star of a hit reality show series. He's a master of self promotion.   But he's a boob. One of the things opinion polls don't show at this point is how negatively he's ranking. I don't know this, but I bet he's leading the polls in terms of the favorite and least liked.   It will all get sorted out. I don't know who the next Republican candidate for President will be, but I feel quite confident it won't be Trump. I don't even believe he wants to be president as much as he wants the attention he receives from running for president.  The one to watch for is Ted Cruz, IMO. I am not a Ted Cruz fan. It has been alarming watching him quickly rise through the ranks with Tea Party support. He's wicked smart, but he's the worst kind of populist, IMO. It's tough for me to find a Republican candidate I actually like."

When the primaries really start it will be cut down to two or three candidates pretty quickly and then we'll see how much support he has among the rest of the 60 percent of republican voters who are currently supporting someone who will drop out."
OutOfTheLoop,3e0zsf,johnadreams,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:33:30 2015 UTC,"To start off with, he has near universal name recognition. That gives him a very big leg up on the rest of the Republican nominees this early in the race. Hillary Clinton is probably the only other candidate in the race that enjoys as high of name recognition. When you are trying to standout from a pack of 16 candidates for the republican nomination, the first step is for people to even know who you are.  The big reason for Trumps surge is he is cornering a subset of the republican base. By placing immigration and a weakened United States as one of his big talking points, he is strongly resonating with certain people. His brashness is seen as an ""independence"" and ""speaking the truth"" by them. These people weren't convinced by Donald about immigrants, he was just repeating back what they have been saying for years. For someone to finally air what they have been thinking is ""refreshing"".  There is a saying that you don't have to be racist to be a republican, but if you are a racist, you probably are republican. The vast majority of republicans are not racist, but I'm willing to bet a large number of the 10-20% supporting Trump probably are. These sentiments have existed in the GOP for a while now, just two years ago a GOP congressman said in reference to children from illegal aliens here in the US: “For everyone who’s a valedictorian, there’s another 100 out there that–they weigh 130 pounds and they’ve got calves the size of cantaloupes because they’re hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert,”. Sentiment about immigration is strong enough in the GOP that simply by trying to advance immigration reform, Rubio may have shot himself in the foot, and tainted his chances at winning the nomination.   Trump is cornering the market on a particular brand of republicans. He isn't going to win the race with that tactic, but it will put him in first for now.  As for the GOP view on Trump, about 49% view him favorably. That number will probably dip due to his comments about McCain over the weekend."

When all of the pogs were gone, the game was over and the person with the most was the winner.  That's seriously the game.    Oh, sure, there's variants about keeping the pogs you scored with so some people wouldn't play with certain ones unless they were trying to get someone else to play with their rare, so essentially 4th grade gambling, but the gist was - smack stack, count score, pass turn to next player, repeat.

The website basically function as account management, dynamic dns, and as a client itself to watch videos. When I say account management I mean controlling your friends list and granting access to others to your server and your video collection.  The quality is great and can be controlled on the fly based on how fast your Internet connection is. If your on 3g quality is going to look bad on big screens but watchable on phones and tablets. The client will automatically adjust to your bandwidth or you can manually set it. If you have enough bandwidth you can even stream completely raw without any transcoding or quality reduction. Great for streaming locally within your home.   http://imgur.com/4m2SsPJ screen shot taken from my phone streaming 1080p mkv file over LTE on my galaxy s5 smartphone"

It in turn allows you to share your media with others that you add as friends. As far as the subscription is concerned it is not required. The subscription gives you access to PS4 plex client, and access to new features months before they become available in the free release.  Personally, me and 5 other guys at work all have plex servers set up at home and share between one another."

Checks two boxes, and adds in people who are in to watching black dudes pound white chicks and people who just like watching a white whatever and a black whatever go at it.

OutOfTheLoop,3duncu,wonderloss,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:03:24 2015 UTC,"This is a seriously good question and the answer as far as I know is hilarious. 4chan (also 4chon, 8chan) has long hosted an anonymous political board which attracts white supremacist comments, generally of the ""ironic"" or at least psychologically strained variety. For a long time they simply yelled at each other about what they were doing on their computers and why they hadn't founded New South Africa yet. Also, they have no control over their lives because everything is being manipulated by Jews. The board is very repetitive.  But recently, maybe 2013-ish, they started developing a meme that Jews are trying to encourage the cuckold fetish in order to destroy white families. As far as I know no one had ever taken this quite so far before, and the people who encouraged the meme almost certainly had the fetish themselves and were uncomfortable with it. But for some reason this theory has become widely known on 4chan and is now hilarious just because finding ""evidence"" of the grand cuck conspiracy legitimately freaks out some newcomers. For example, a GamerGate friend of mine recently posted this on his facebook:  http://nymag.com/thecut/2015/07/what-open-marriage-taught-one-man-about-feminism.html  This ""Cuckelodeon"" thing was almost certainly spread by a fetishist in denial."

OutOfTheLoop,3dxo05,razorbeamz,10,Mon Jul 20 11:37:21 2015 UTC,"Did a little bit of digging. Looks like Red Bull has struck a sponsorship deal with whoever is in charge of making the Smash Bros. part of EVO and other fighting game tournaments happen. All I've seen so far in terms of negativity is just people being up in arms about corporate sponsorship. It might go deeper than that, but that's generally what my search turned up. I wouldn't be surprised if part of the sponsorship deal was to the effect of handing out promotional materials, being mentioned by commentators, or player sponsorship.  EDIT: Looks like they may have also put their branding on ""Salty Suite,"" which, to my understanding, is a Smash Bros Melee event that occurs within bigger fighting game events like Apex. Apparently the most recent one at EVO was lackluster, and people are blaming the sponsor.  EDIT 2 Electric Boogaloo: Just asked about this on a thread dealing with the subject in /r/smashbros so it might be worth keeping an eye on that permalink to see if anybody answers it."
OutOfTheLoop,3dxo05,HireALLTheThings,10,Mon Jul 20 14:09:57 2015 UTC,"I saw a bit of it unfold. Part of it is a sector of the sub who look fondly (perhaps with some rose-tinted vision) at the days when Smash Bros. was (still kinda is) ""grassroots"" - in contrast with other comp games like Dota, LoL, CSGO, and various fighting games, many of the major tournament organizers were on their own in terms of setting up; that is, Nintendo barely got involved, and it was/is standard for people to bring in CRTs and systems to play on.  So part of it is people seeing an end to their ""glory days."" Many are, in equal parts, blaming the sponsors and the ones who are accepting the sponsors (in this case, VGBC and its main man, GimR). You can see this in the people lamenting a move toward ""e$port$."" The whole thing was bolstered by people being required to subscribe for $12 to watch the stream in high quality, which has been SOP for EVO, but a first for smash.  Salty Suite has traditionally been an event where competitors go to settle scores by placing money down in a match against their rivals, winner take all. The big idea behind it is that they do so in front of a big crowd and basically fuel the hype by hurling insults at each other before the match starts. Part ego battle, part exhibition match. The issue with this salty suite was that (1) it started 45 minutes late, (2) the matches themselves, and specifically the ""salt"" between players felt very forced or nonexistent, removing the rivalry aspect in some cases, (3) it was held in an actual small suite rather than a big room for a crowd to pack into, (4) it was invite only and only 40 people actually were allowed in, for safety reasons. With tensions high about the whole ""e$port$"" thing, people jumped on a bandwagon to blame whoever they could for salty suite not being as it always had, so Red Bull was caught in the crossfire for its presence/involvement there."
OutOfTheLoop,3dxo05,tacticalf41L,3,Mon Jul 20 16:58:08 2015 UTC,"As someone who's followed the scene for a few years now, I'd like to expand on this. Another source of hate against big sponsors has to do with the gradual death of the Project M scene. Project M was a large scale, fan made mod for Super Smash Bros. Brawl that introduced the fast-paced, high skill level, Melee-type game play to Brawl; while re-balancing the characters to all be tournament Viable.  Project M was a welcome breath of fresh air from the increasingly Fox dominated Melee scene, dubbed ""20XX"" (Of the 13 major Melee tournaments this year, 10 of them were won by a player using Fox).   Once big corporations started sponsoring tournaments, many tournament organizers stopped including Project M at their events out of fear of causing legal trouble with Nintendo.   This might have, at best, had a controversial reaction in the community; however, big sponsorships have had no noticable effect on the scene. Tournament venues are not bigger, prize pools are still pathetically small (EVO 2015, the largest Melee tournament in history had a grand prize of 11,000 dollars, some major tournaments have a grand prize of close to $1,000), and tournament organizers have been silent as to where all that sponsorship money is winding up. The only noticeable effect that the community has seen since big sponsors became involved is that Project M, once a major fixture at every Melee tournament, has not been included at a major tournament since The Big House 4 in October of last year.   it could definitely be argued that sponsors had no direct involvement with these changes in the scene, and that the TOs are to blame, or that corporate sponsorship was an inevitable outcome from the growing Smash Bros. competitive scene, and you'd be right to some degree on all points. That said, for these reasons, and those stated by the user above, many members of the community has been disgruntled by the sudden corporate focus that tournament organizers are pursuing."

OutOfTheLoop,3dxo05,HireALLTheThings,4,Mon Jul 20 17:07:23 2015 UTC,"There's an event that happens after some tournaments called a Salty Suite. Basically, it's a bunch of show matches by famous players that the players put money on and trash talk a lot. Mostly it's about pride. It happens super late usually because its after the tournament. This year, the Smash Melee Salty Suite at EVO was run by a group called VGBC and sponsored by Red Bull. In the past, some of the Salty Suites had been open to the public. This year, due to space, it was extremely limited on who can get in. People got mad and blamed it on Red Bull despite VGBC saying before EVO that it would be a smaller invite only event. Some of the previous Salty Suites were at more Smash focused tourneys and had more space to do them. At EVO this year, they couldn't get as much space and were worried about the fire marshal shutting them down."

Here's pretty much a summary of how the drama unfolds:   Something happens in the smashing world, maybe it's controversial. A vocal minority in /r/smashbros reacts negatively. Smashers on Twitter start berating /r/smashbros, acting like they're the cancer of the community. People start trying to define what the ""real"" community is for like the millionth time (hint: it always includes them, because unlike how they paint /r/smashbros they've been to a local, like, once so that makes them knowledgeable)   Yes there's stream monsters on /r/smashbros but honestly it's an FGC subreddit (yes Smash is pretty much FGC now even through the differences it has with other FGC games) what do you expect? And yet every time they get labeled as ""Smash 4 babies"" because people can't get over their petty game rivalries. I've been there for a lot of the drama and it usually unfurls like this and it's gotten old.  /r/smashbros is a pretty big part of the community, rivaling SmashBoards in size and reach, so when there's a shitstorm there it's a pretty big deal."

OutOfTheLoop,3dxo05,Zenekis,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:41:32 2015 UTC,"I want to add that Salty Suites is a thing that has been in the FGC for very long which is usually just some top player or someone in general that tells people to come to his or her room at the hotel to play some moneymatches or longer sets of games to settle arguements about who is the better player while often drinking alot of alcohol. Often streamed on very poor hotel internet.  I'm not part of smash scene so I might be slightly wrong but this is what I gather from this whole drama from when I read about it during Evo.   At Apex this year they had an event called a Salty Suite on the main stage of the venue they held Apex in streamed on the mainstream for the event and with people playing sets of what I assume was to settle some arguement about who is better etc.  This Salty Suite at Evo was a more traditional Salty Suite in which Red Bull got hold of a room that could fit about 40 people, that was also shared with the Red Bull Street Fighter Salty Suite if I understand it correct. Due to the low amount of people that could enter due to fire hazards or something the event was Invite Only. This angered alot of r/smashbros fans 'cause their idea of a Salty Suite is a mainstage event with alot of trashtalking before games and the crowd being allowed to spectate and add to the ""hype"" of the games played.   Tl;dr: People found the free extra content Red Bull and VGBC provided at Evo not up to their expectations, started yelling that VCBC was a sellout and was in general really pissy about the whole situation.  Edit: Changed the link to the right subreddit."
