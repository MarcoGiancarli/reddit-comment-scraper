I'd rather see a criminal case go forward, given that there's increasing evidence that neoncotinoid pesticides have a significant link to the rise in autism cases.   I'm an attorney and I'm trying to figure out what the judge would do if you pulled the same stunt - offered a Monsanto executive a glass full of the stuff to drink if it's so safe.  It really would be dispositive of both the safety and their knowledge if the executive refused it.

""genetic engineered"" food is not only a breeding technique. Maybe if you were talking 50 years ago then yes, your tractor argument might hold some weight. however, we are talking about present day. you can't breed a plant to be roundup resistant or pesticide resistant. That is genetic material that IS inserted into the plant.  I don't think GMO's are really that bad. considering, that GMO roundup resistant plants eventually stop expressing the gene, but there are some others that do pose more of an environmental risk that need to be taken into account.   as far as health goes, it would be better for them to be labeled. We are inserting genetic material into these food products, which may or may not have an impact on our health. we really need more long term studies.   source: Biotechnologist     Full linked thread mirror (png image): http://mythsmirrorbot.vkk.me/files/1902f6d0fc0dd9b67bc133fba00ac1bd68879756_07-20-15.png"

GMO sales and management practices are inherently anti-competitive and potentially ruinous to economies in the developing world.  Here in the states, GMOs have led to numerous lawsuits by Monsanto to shut down neighboring farms unintentionally affected by Monsanto corn strains.  Monsanto prohibits the recovery of seeds for later harvests and has used that prohibition to raise prices on subsequent sales of their seeds.  Monsanto seeds routinely get rejected by developing world countries for just these sorts of practices.  Monsanto makes questionable yield claims and they out-and-out lie regarding the needs for the use of pesticides.  So there are a lot of other problems with GMOs than just the food safety aspect.

GMOMyths,3c6yo1,Soul_Shot,4,Mon Jul 6 01:43:28 2015 UTC,"Highlights:   As someone who browsed Reddit from time to time, when I began to learn about these things I eventually discovered a subreddit known as /r/conspiracy. While there, people would often talk about “shills,” a catch-all term for those who are paid to engage in the kind of activity discussed above. In 2013, Reddit’s blog reported that the Eglin Air Force Base in Florida is it’s “most addicted city,” with over 100,000 visits per day.[12]  On Reddit, there are numerous subreddits which exist to mock those who are wary of shills and are thus likely to be deemed “conspiracy theorists.” The most commonly known subreddit which serves this purpose is /r/conspiratard...      This example alone shows how deeply entangled the label ""conspiratard"" is with the history of institutional racism in the United States. The activity of /r/conspiratard's mods further illustrates how this history intersects with sanism, especially in the context of 9/11...      Leaving aside the question of Mossad’s relationship with Reddit for now...      ...moderated by /u/BipolarBear0, a moderator of /r/justshillthings, with the flair “#1 shill”...      In this thread, a number of accounts came to Monsanto’s defense, including /u/Scuderia,  a moderator of pro-Monsanto subreddits such as /r/GMOMyths and /r/GMOcirclejerk, and /u/JF_Queeny, a moderator of /r/GMOmyths and /r/MarchAgainstMonsanto. One of these accounts, /u/Soul_Shot, made a total of fifty-fifty posts defending Monsanto in this thread, and was formerly a moderator of /r/MarchAgainstMonsanto as well.      The Nature Conservancy is working closely with Dow Chemical, which manufactured Agent Orange along with Monsanto in the 1960s.[20] Stratfor has worked for Dow Chemical as well, when it monitored the online activities of activists who were seeking redress for the 1984 Dow Chemical/Union Carbine gas disaster in Bhopal India, which led to thousands of deaths, more than half a million injuries, and lasting environmental damage.[26]"

GMOMyths,3bwp35,dtiftw,2,Thu Jul 2 19:58:07 2015 UTC,"Talking about the study that high-priest-of-slack posted, it's yet another of the 90-day feeding studies that are neither necessary nor of any real scientific interest according to this 2014 Ricroch et al review:   Conclusions   The 90-day subchronic feeding studies compiled here are heterogenous in quality and consequently some may be considered as less convincing than others. However, it is a general observation (also made for long term animal feeding studies and for ‘omics’ plant profiling; see Ricroch, 2013) that all studies conclude that the commercial GM varieties tested were as safe and nutritious as existing commercial varieties. The question that rationally arises is whether such studies should be added at all to the safety assessment of GM crops on a routine basis (if no suspicion of toxicity arose from the previous comparative compositional analysis and agronomic analyses of a GM variety). One should also stress the above-mentioned consideration on the ‘normality’ of the GM lines imposed by the GM selection process itself.   In addition, after 18 years (since 1996) of marketing, no sound research, nor veterinary experience after feeding farm animals has provided reasons to doubt about GM crop safety. Therefore, the scientific rational conclusion is that 90-day feeding studies are not needed on a routine basis, and that further long-term animal feeding studies or multigenerational feeding studies are not needed either, unless there are specific reasons to do so (see Snell et al., 2012; Ricroch, 2013; Ricroch et al., 2013).   As we previously mentioned : “Thus, on a scientific basis, it may be time to simplify the assessment of food products derived from plants obtained by modern biotechnology (at least those with agronomic traits and no deliberate metabolic changes), and therefore reduce their costs. However, the GM food scare has never been science-based, but rather originates from a different rationality” (Kuntz and Ricroch, 2012). Therefore, we must conclude that the recent EU decision to impose mandatory animal 90-day feeding studies is not based on an integrated scientific knowledge, but rather on the current balance of political power in the context of the EU precautionary principle doctrine."

They have sued and destroyed farmers who were unlucky enough to have some Monsanto seed blow in on the wind from their neighbor's farm. As soon as Monsanto finds one seed of their plants on your property you're doomed. Their lawyers will bankrupt you in court. In India especially this has led to a massive surge in farmer suicides.

I don't think you appreciate the debate within journalistic circles nor the ethical dilemma you are dismissing with such a statement. While I know redditors are not journalists the issue of access vs. authenticity is the reason this post was written by /u/nallen whether they realize it or not. A blanket statement such as, ""you should be cheering for the opportunity to ask questions from senior people at Monsnato."" ignores these very serious debates and problems in public relations and journalism.   Even the framing within this post reveals a level of naivety, which I will assume is benign naivety and not willful, about who Dr. Fred Perlak is. He is the Vice-President of Monsanto Hawaii and not simply a ""legit research scientist"". Describing him as simply so extremely misleading. Further he is a Vice-President who has participated in community engagement tours and public relations activities in the past.  In short, while he is a scientist his role within Monsanto is MUCH MUCH closer to being that of a ""PR, business, and marketing person.""   If the mods and /u/nallen were unaware of his background in this regard then the AMA should be canceled. If they are aware then I will say it is HIGHLY unethical to say, ""We require that our AMA guests be scientists working in the area, and not PR, business or marketing people."" But as I said earlier I will chalk this up to benign naivety on the part of people wanting to create a scientific dialogue but rest assured this is absolutely, positively, 100% a public relations stunt done by a high-level executive at Monsanto and is simply being done under the guise of ""science"" as far as the company is concerned.

I've heard from a scientist at a competing firm that Monsanto acquired the technology to have hybrid corn produce offspring that still has all the hybrid traits, but that they keep this technology locked up for fear of the ramifications on their business.  Does Monsanto own this technology? If so, would you care to elaborate on it's implications?  (Some info to redditors: this is unconnected to the GMO/roundup discussion, many(most?) commercial corn varieties are non-gmo, but they are hybrids (like mules), grown by selectively crossing two separate parent lines (horses and donkeys) by specialized breeders. This means farmers have to buy new seed every year to get the high yields you can get with hybrids.. Most other crops, like wheat, are rarely hybrids, the farmer can just resow a part of last year's harvest and get the same yield.    Making hybrid traits hereditary could empower farmers and help tremendously in quickly developing and spreading better corn varieties, maybe more resistant to local pests and threats in less economically interesting areas like Africa.)"

EDIT:  Ok, I'll help.  The vast majority of the genetically modified food that you will encounter is modified with a gene to make it Roundup-ready.  What that means is that the plant will be able to live when it is drenched in a toxic and carcinogenic chemical herbicide that is sold under the brand name Roundup.  Normally you can't spray it directly on a crop, because the crop will die due to the toxicity of the chemical.  When the crop is genetically modified with the Roundup-ready gene, you can spray the chemicals right on it and it will live.  This makes it cheaper to farm on a massive scale and is more profitable than selling regular crops.  The downside is that it leaves a chemical residue on the plant, which we all get to eat, but who cares about that, right?

GMOMyths,39v9ri,ShillForMonsanto,1 point,Mon Jun 15 02:25:18 2015 UTC,"Relevant quote:   Since the turn of the century, these genetically modified crops have risen to dominance in the Midwest. Designed to withstand dousing from the Monsanto company’s Roundup weed killer, the plants enabled farmers to swiftly kill competing weeds, including milkweed, while leaving their crops untouched. In 2013, 83 percent of all corn and 93 percent of soybeans in the United States were herbicide tolerant, totaling nearly 155 million acres, much of it in the Midwest.  It’s no coincidence monarchs faltered at the same time. Karen Oberhauser, a conservation biologist at the University of Minnesota, and a colleague estimated that as Monsanto’s Roundup Ready corn and soybeans spread across the Midwest, the amount of milkweed in farm fields fell by more than 80 percent. Oberhauser determined that the loss of milkweed almost exactly mirrored the decline in monarch egg production.  “We have this smoking gun,” Oberhauser said. “This is the only thing that we’ve actually been able to correlate with decreasing monarch numbers.”"

GMOMyths,3919v0,kofclubs,2,Mon Jun 8 14:54:43 2015 UTC,"Comment by Just-R on ""JRE #655 - Kevin Folta"" in /r/JoeRogan:    Kevin Folta is asserting highly propagandistic views in this podcast. It is alarming that so few people on this board see through his bullshit - I suppose he was hired as a public scientist for a good reason. In any case, consciously or not, Folta is functioning as a shill and I'll try to explain why:  He begins the podcast by framing the issues surrounding GMOs and the oligarchic power within agribusiness in such a way as to reduce it to a 'debate' over what GMOs are in principal. Reducing it to this allows him to focus on what genetic engineering is, how ubiquitous it has been before modern technological techniques and what potential it has. While much of this is rational and generally correct (and this is why most of you seem to respect Folta), there's a catch: this argument is not one outside of the major media outlets where the real critiques of companies like Monsanto are. By focusing on this pseudo-argument, Folta creates a red herring to distract the public from the very real and very important issues. The pseudo-argument is alluring for it is very easy to agree with and convincing enough to vigorously oppose those who don't understand it: the technology is neutral with the potential to make food more abundantly available, more nutritious, cheaper, bigger, etc. and anyone opposed to these beautiful things must be crazy and irrational because they are fearing the idea of manipulating the genetics of nature, as if they are so sacred! But this a non-argument, a classic major media smokescreen by and large (though of course some irrationally fear GMOs in principal due to a lack of understanding the science). The propaganda Folta asserts is in focusing on the smokescreen and ignoring the real issues, but it isn't in just what he omits that we can criticize Folta for being propagandistic, but it is what he overtly says too.  Folta doesn't seem to be aware, for whatever reason, that the highly subsidized Western agribusinesses contribute heavily to keeping developing nations in poverty by forcing them to compete in the 'free market'. And, unlike what Folta believes, the lack of food for some 1+ billion people in the world is not due to an inability to use modern techniques of genetic manipulation, but to political and economic factors involving exploitation (which dates back to colonization). This is a very important point to get across because the whole story of ""GMOs will save us all"" falls apart as delusional fantasy. It's the same story we're told by 'futurists' where he hear that technology will free us from our suffering with abundance followed by transcendence when in truth it is a gross misunderstanding and extrapolation of modern science that undermines who technology is for and how it is used. These are secular fairytales used to distract us (and to promote technological development, with the help of the taxpayer) while the dynamic of Superpower and its allies continue to suppress and kill the oppressed and ravage the world's resources unsustainably.   Another issue Folta gets wrong is when he assures the listeners that GMOs are safe for consumption. This is the same bullshit that the defenders of big pharma will assert. The oligarchy of agribusiness simply want to maximize profits. This means introducing genetic modifications and chemicals/pesticides to reach this goal, whether or not it is safe for consumption. Sure, it's not going to kill the consumer or farmer outright, but the fact of the matter is that the regulation on this is very weak and is exacerbated of course by lobbying. To accumulate enough data to ensure safety would be way outside the short-term concerns the authoritarian corporate structure allows for and big agribusiness is no exception. In addition, such modifications to crops are never about nutrient density, which may very well be on the decline in most fruits and vegetables that are genetically engineered, which means you may have to eat 6 apples to get the nutrients of what 1 non-GE apple may have provided, leading to continually less healthy consumers. So by claiming that GMOs are safe across the board and by claiming that corporations like Monsanto strive for very safe GMOs because they wouldn't turn a profit otherwise as if profits don't outweigh lawsuits with these corporations is a flat-out untruthful attempt by Folta to get us to appeal to authority - the science and data do not exist to conclusively say that all of these GMOs and chemicals used are safe for consumption like he insists. He's just lying here or quite unbelievably ignorant. He should know as a scientist that the interactions are utterly complex and even subtle changes can have drastic effects long-term, especially with complications such as cancer. This is common sense a layman can understand: we are the product of a very long history of evolution where the protein interactions in our natural diet and environment are so precise that even small changes can disrupt large biological systems. This attempt to get us to appeal to authority is also accompanied by a display of complete ignorance to how transnationals operate (by failing to mention the lobbying, how they don't test for long-term health effects, how unsustainable the use of many fertilizers are, etc.). At what point does the ignorance become propaganda? One look at where his grant money comes from and I can imagine the right answer is: the very beginning.    Folta also seems to think that this oligarchy is benevolent and merely wants to benefit from its honestly earned R&D, unaware of the fact that the taxpayers, through subsidies, take the hit through mechanisms like the Farm Bill in the US while these corporations reap all the profits. This is a very important point to understand how these transnationals operate: they use public funds for things like R&D to eventually generate private profit and they undeservedly and horrendously continue to capitalize on their patents (that the public pays for!) all the while lobbying against deregulation and participating secretly in writing bills like the TPP - all to maximize profits.  Folta seems to be completely ignorant to the consequences of an oligarchy too, namely that once these patents are in place and become intellectual property of the corporations (again, thanks to you, the taxpayers), they can continue to raise the prices of their products (seeds, fertilizers, crops etc.). This technique will continue squeezing out family farmers domestically and devastating developing-nations farmers and peasants, allowing them to manipulate the market at will, fluctuating their prices (expectedly in the upward direction) without competition and with such power as to render safety regulations meaningless outside of very obvious and immediate hazardous effects (which will be, as they already are, less restrictive in developing nations). Folta believes farmers want patented seeds because they are simply so great due their effectiveness, but the truth is that probably most family farmers would actually want to be organic, but this technology creates a market 'force' that cannot be competed against in this state-capitalist system. Increased crop yield, increased pest resistance, increased weather resistance, heavier produce that ripens slower and the like must be used for farmers to survive in the this globalized market - an ideal scenario for the oligarchy. This is strengthened through economic instruments such as the WTO as well, which, among other things, ensure that it is illegal for countries to favour locally sourced goods.  He also fails to mention the unsustainable nature of the agricultural practices of these transnationals, such as the soil erosion from their fertilizers, the massive deforestation in the Amazon for soybean farms (to feed cattle), phosphorus depletion, etc.   The bottom line is that food is a necessity for human life and when Folta so ignorantly reveres the potential of biotech at the cost of the reality of how it's used, when he downplays the effects of centralized corporate control and distorts the facts of how they operate, when he willfully ignores the unsustainable agricultural practices that devastate the poor, warms our climate and makes our future uncertain, he contributes to this oligarchic takeover that will destroy us and much of the life on this planet.

The company I worked for, which shall remain nameless for internet purposes, deemed my work unsuitable for investment due to an accident we had with one of the lab animals.  The bastards had forced me to use my research and findings in combat applications when all I was just trying to do was make the world a better place.  What did they expect would happen?  Angered, but undeterred, I began my own unsanctioned experiments with the gardener and his progress was staggering.  Soon after our experiments began, his intellect and cognitive ability had far exceeded my own.  Even more amazing, he developed telekentic and pyrokenetic powers, eventually causing a great deal of havoc in the local community where I lived.  I knew I had to confront him and stop this madness, but before I could capture him he managed to turn himself into a being of pure energy and take over the digital world by making persistent and annoying phone calls.

Common sense tells me it's a bad idea to knowingly ingest substances that kill healthy intestinal bacteria while not harming pathogens, especially considering DNA analysis of my stool showed an imbalance.  by your logic it must be okay to eat red meat too, since the cancer association may be correlative only.

Dumbass activists love to say this but if you imagine a field of young corn with rows 15"" apart you may not find millions of weeds...therefore most will hit the ground.   Roundup works through leaf absorbtion, it binds to soil and doesn't get absorbed via the roots.   At the time a field is sprayed with a single pass herbicide , the actual crop is easily less than 50% of the surface area.   To get measurable amounts of herbicide in the corn by harvest would require an amazing series of events that would likely kill the plant first."

At the highest ever measured levels of Glyphosate residue on soy (17 mg/kg), a 70 kilogram person would have to eat 8.2 kilograms of soy beans a day to hit the reference dose (so I don't know, maybe double that to get to dangerous levels for daily intake).

Some strains of fruits/veggies are genetically modified to be ""Roundup-ready"", meaning they are resistant to Monsanto's herbicide Roundup. Very convenient for farmers who can spray a metric fuckton of herbicide on their crops and kill the weeds, keep the crops.  But Roundup does nasty things to humans who ingest it. Among other things, it kills your gut flora. Basically it can shut down your digestive system. You'll get the shits and your body will be unable to process nutrients.   And it's carcinogenic, so welcome to Tumor Town.  So if you're eating genetically modified food, there's a good chance you're eating Roundup too.  I have no idea what splicing a carrot with a toad will do to you,  There's my little contribution. Also, fuck you Monsanto PR shills in advance. I hope you spend many years in prison.

GMOMyths,37c09l,whatgold,2,Wed May 27 22:22:35 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen any logical mechanism or study stating this. Forgive me for not taking your word for it.   I'm trying to think of something that someone could add to human tissue cultures (other than growth media) that wouldn't kill the cells and having some trouble -- salt, sugar, dishsoap, organic not-from-concentrate free-range orange juice, soy milk... Even without adding anything other than media it's often very hard to keep the cells alive. Ask anyone who's ever cultured human cells and they'll say the same.  The reason for this is that human cells don't grow in isolation. They grow in tissues, supported by the other tissues of the body. They're hard to keep alive in culture because the media that they're grown in is only a best approximation of their natural environment.  Another significant factory is that the cells that are cultured are not healthy normal human cells. They are immortal cancerous cell lines, cells that were isolated from aggressive tumours that have lost all cell cycle control and will continue to multiply forever. That's why it's even possible to grow animal cells in culture -- normal tissues are simply unable to propagate like single-celled organisms. Cultured animal cells do not have a normal metabolism or protein expression -- they're malignant cancerous cells that will try to multiply as long as they continue to receive glucose.  In vitro studies are certainly useful, but they have serious limitations. Be very wary of any conclusions drawn solely from in vitro cell culture studies. They're a very useful starting point -- for example if an effect is seen in cell culture then in vivo studies can be done to test whether the effect is real -- but ultimately they are not a realistic model of any animal system.  Adding roundup to cultured cells is roughly analogous to injecting roundup directly into your kidneys: certainly harmful, but a completely unrealistic model of exposure."

GMOMyths,36zouw,ba55fr33k,-2,Sun May 24 00:02:25 2015 UTC,"here is an interesting observation from those who study hunger and malnutrition very closely  Harmful economic systems. Hunger Notes believes that a principal underlying cause of poverty and hunger is the ordinary operation of the economic and political systems in the world. Essentially control over resources and income is based on military, political, and economic power that typically ends up in the hands of a minority, who live well, while those at the bottom barely survive, if they do.  claiming that we 'need' g.m. foods to feed the hungry is a ruse, look:  The world produces enough food to feed everyone. For the world as a whole, per capita food availability has risen from about 2220 kcal/person/day in the early 1960s to 2790 kcal/person/day in 2006-08, while developing countries even recorded a leap from 1850 kcal/person/day to over 2640 kcal/person/day. This growth in food availability in conjunction with improved access to food helped reduce the percentage of chronically undernourished people in developing countries from 34 percent in the mid 1970s to just 15 percent three decades later."

Despite this progress, about one in eight people, or 13.5 percent of the overall population, remain chronically undernourished in these regions, down from 23.4 percent in 1990–92.

The only thing that is better is actually spraying herbicide, but that only works for herbicide traits and...wouldn't you know it...you actually have to be certified to spray herbicides. Any idiot can use the GMO babby test.   Those ""lab in a suitcase"" kits are only practical for extremely time-sensitive assays on novel targets. Situations where time and action is more important than reliability and cost. Think like...public health settings (testing people for a specific ebola strain and time = lives saved.)

Every year, they release GMO seeds to farmers.  The following year, they get more seeds, but this time it requires a different formula of round-up.  The farmers plant every seed because of this.  They know that even if they hung onto this years seeds to plant next year...next years round up won't work on this years seeds.  Monsanto knows what the hell they're doing and they keep farmers on a ferris wheel that doesn't stop.  Then, since they plant all of the seeds...they never sell it all.  Then the subsidies come in and they get compensated by the govt. with our tax dollars for not being able to sell as much as they bought into.  The problem is that they don't spend nearly as much on the plants that don't grow in comparison to what they get back from the govt.  It was a hot topic for a while that seemed to day.  People were pissed for like two weeks and it just faded away.    Also, Monsanto seeds are brutal on the ground's nutrients.  It's not just the round up that ruins fields.  If you plant monsanto corn seeds in a field...you can't plant anything that would be remotely sweet for the next year or two in the same field.  They rape the soil of nutrients.  IDK, I guess you could grow potatoes or some shit.  Not yams/sweet potatoes, though.  No fruits, etc.    Farmers can't get out of the revolving door right now.  At least not in the US.  Once Monsanto got the ball rolling, the farmers couldn't stop it.  You can't grow next years seed, because it is designed to work with next years round up.  If you don't use it, your crops won't go to well that season.  If you use last years seeds as I said...it would just be like not using the round up.  You'd be spraying useless chemicals for no reason.  They design the seeds of the year to work with the respective years round up.  Anything else doesn't work out too well for farmers.  I believe they're signed to some sort of clauses as well that further tie them down with monsanto.

How the hell does someone get gilded for an unsourced rant on /r/science.    There are many causes of colony collapse. There is only one cause of Colony Collapse Disorder.  Colony Collapse Disorder is caused by exposure to neurotoxins called neonicotinoids (Neo=new; nicotinoids=nicotines. These are synthetic nicotintines.). These neurotoxins are used by Bayer and over a dozen other chemical companies as agents in systemic pesticides, which are applied to crop seeds and become part of the plant. Plants grown from treated seeds contain the toxin in in their vascular system, and therefore in their pollen and nectar. This is designed to kill insects. Honeybees are an insect. Neonicotinoids kill honeybees. No one should be mystified by this.   http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/35l4lq/science_ama_series_im_sarah_myers_a_professional/cr5flat  Edit: there seem to be a lot of unflaired users arguing about how chemicals are evil.

Whereas normally the physicists deal with phenomena at the picowatt scale. The measure of ignorance is eighteen orders of magnitude here."

What are your credentials again?   Index of /acrobat   What? No official journal.....  Reading a random selection, none of these pdfs feature anything that is in a peer-reviewed journal so questionable quality on the research presented. Some of the papers have to do with things that are related to cold fusion, but do not discuss it, and still lack peer-review, not to mention the website... This is just a list you though at someone to try and shut them up if they disagree with you.

GMOMyths,33rm0r,bouchard,-1,Tue Apr 28 11:51:45 2015 UTC,"Oh, so studying physics at an accredited university makes me incompetent   Until the cold fusion is not taught at the universities systematically, then every layman who is interested about original sources at the web can be much more qualified and competent in this matter, than just you - sorry. Don't overestimate your qualification so much, if you're really ignorant.   No official journal.....   This is just the problem with mainstream science - the official journals ban and censor the articles about cold fusion systematically, despite the wide material already present in experimental journals. Check the pluralistic ignorance article at the Wikipedia for to become familiar with the mechanism of your ignorance."
GMOMyths,33rm0r,ShillForMonsanto,3,Tue Apr 28 13:01:46 2015 UTC,"Until the cold fusion is not taught at the universities systematically    Its not because there is no science to be had on the topic currently, so there is not much depth as far as a theoretical explaining what is going on. I don't know what you meant with this statement or how it relates to your next point.   then every layman who is interested about original sources at the web can be much more qualified and competent in this matter, than just you - sorry.    So me studying science and math for 7 years, learning how science works, and learning advanced topic in physics some how makes me less qualified than someone who knows how to do a Google search? I am sorry, but what delusional world do you live in where experts and knowledgeable people are less qualified on a topic than layfolk? I would think most physicists who have at-least some graduate level training would have a wide general knowledge. At my university we had a scientific research and ethics course, and we had a student led discussion on cold fusion research, and we used internet resources as our material, and our general discussion was on the issues surrounding the research, like people suing others, because of the claims that the science was not reproduce-able. One major thing we discussed was the lack of reproduce-able work and looked for any acceptable works, and sadly we found none.   I will ask you again what qualifications do you have to come in and assert such authority on a topic?   This is just the problem with mainstream science - the official journals ban and censor the articles about cold fusion systematically, despite the wide material already present in experimental journals.   Reputable journals have this thing called peer-review, which is not meant to suppress any one topic or people they dislike, but to ensure a standard of quality of the types of work published.  This does not mean poor quality science is not published, it just means on average, the works published have to meet a certain quality standard, and I doubt that any of the papers on that list would pass a peer-review. There is no banning or censoring, just a level of expected quality, like labeling your axis....   Check the pluralistic ignorance article  at the Wikipedia for to become familiar with the mechanism of your ignorance.   summarizing the wiki:  ""The term pluralistic ignorance refers to erroneous beliefs held by a group of individuals about the attitudes or behavior of others""  I do not see how this is relevant to not accepting research that does not meet a standard of quality. Most physicist believe that cold fusion research is largely a pathological science, not that the people who perform the research are some how in the wrong just because they want to understand cold fusion. What is incorrect is to keep insisting cold fusion is a viable technology when no reproduce-able evidence is at hand.    I am not say those people who  pursue this research are stupid or wrong, its just that since the initial research decades ago, no solid explanation for an mechanism has come forth. I am not say that it is impossible that there maybe something there, I am just say that a lack of reliable and repeatable experiments currently exists, and until there is a major result or theoretical break through, cold fusion research will remain a fringe field"
GMOMyths,33rm0r,mem_somerville,-1,Tue Apr 28 14:32:34 2015 UTC,"its just that since the initial research decades ago, no solid explanation for an mechanism has come forth   If this is your very only problem with cold fusion, then for example HT superconductivity or dark matter is the research of the same category - we still have no reliable theory yet. The lack of reliable experiments is only your dream, given the fact, you never bothered to look into literature, which I linked.   what delusional world do you live in where experts and knowledgeable people are less qualified on a topic than layfolk?   In this context the reading of articles The era of expert failure by Arnold Kling,  Why experts are usually wrong by David H.

GMO pesticide resistance genes have migrated into nearby weeds, when Monsanto was sure that was impossible.  The seed corn sold by Monsanto is not supposed to be able to fully reproduce, so that farmers have to buy anew for each planting -- but neighboring fields have been found to have Monsanto-modified genes, either from lateral transmission of genes or because the corn can fully reproduce and the wind carries it.  No matter how it happened, Monsanto then sued innocent farmers for having ""their"" GMO corn.

BT cotten has killed off thousands of farmers who are indebted , while low cost sustainble organic methods which have HIGHER yield used by farmers from Bihar to Punjab are put on the back burner for ill-educated unscientific people YOU like who understand NOTHING about farming.   BT Cotton for your information only gives higher yield for the first 3-4 years. And after that reduces as much by half every year.  And thats what HIGH end  farmers gets with drip irrigation and highly expensive nutrient dense soil 20-25 quintils. In 3-4 years that number drops to 12-15 and in 5-6 it quite often drops below 10 and thats after permanent soil degradation which needs complete makeover. If you think farmers can replace their soil and do a complete makeover you need to learn something about farming  On the other hand organic methods which cost far less with on site water and simple composting techniques can continuously push out 15-18 quintils for decades . Without any soil degradation or external costs. And thats WITHOUT crop rotation.  Another example is BT Corn which you get max 12 bushels per acre after a few years that number drastically drops costing the farmer thousands of dollars to replace the soil and re-till the soil. On other hand self sustainble zero cost farming gets the same 11 bushels per acre with ZERO cost farming and external input.  What's worse is every year you need MORE and MORE chemicals to get the same yield. The weeds become resistant as do the pests. So every year Monsanto gives you even stronger chemicals like roundup reddy to take on these changes. Which cost more and more.  Not to mention you have zero understanding of it effects local biodiversity and seed sustainbility.  What am I saying talking to a kid who has never even been on a farm.   Learn a little bit about no tilling and permaculture methods.  Its clear you have zero understanding about farmins. Another psuedo scientist on Reddit with a big mouth.

Its more powerful than guns. This is the best way to control the populations of the world"" - Vandana Shiva on Monsanto"" in /r/conspiracy:    It's the same across the world; I grew up in the countryside in Ireland. Farmers may only plant the seeds approved by the Department of Agriculture. Guess where the vast majority of seeds come from? Yup. Monsanto.    Yields have doubled in the past twenty years, which sounds pretty great, right?   It is, except that the cost of producing the grains has also grown because all the seeds now need to be sprayed. Guess where the sprays come from? Yup. Monsanto.  So farmers have twice the produce leeching goodness from the ground, have twice the work to do because of all the sprays required, and income has remained pretty much stable because the oversupply of grains has saturated the market.   Farmers are on a treadmill and no matter how fast they run, they remain exactly where they started. But they can't not run, or the treadmill will simply spit them out.  Anyone with even a passing interest in Irish history has heard of the potato famine; but for those who haven't monoculture decimated the country.  Monsanto, because it owns the patents on seeds and the patents on the sprays that make the seeds grow, is quite literally in the monoculture business. It defies all logic - business logic, humanitarian logic, environmental logic - to allow one company such control.  Now I'm pretty much a hawk when it comes to economics and bleeding heart liberals really get on my wick. Having said that, few people realise quite how insidious a thing Monsanto is. Its patents should be owned, if they're owned at all, by all humanity.  If Spectre was real it wouldn't fire lasers at earth from some moon base, it would run Monsanto...

And why would there be? It's not supposed to be ingested by the quart, it's supposed to be sprayed over fields.  On the matter of the video, why is it supposed to be so damning that he doesn't want to drink something that's not appetizing, and not even food? If I were to say ""drinking a quart of seawater won't kill you, but I personally would not want to drink it"", nobody would be calling me a hypocrite.

That statement is completely false and the suggestion that you can ingest over 900mL and you will be fine is not only a lie it irresponsibly misrepresents a toxic substance as harmless since at 100mL you experience kidney failure and that's not even taking into account the added surfactants in the herbicide he was referring too which are far more poisonous than glyphosate by itself: http://curriculum.toxicology.wikispaces.net/Glyphosate#Glyphosate-DETERMINATION%20OF%20SEVERITY-Ingested%20dose  Imagine saying drinking a quart of bleach or a quart of anti-freeze was harmless, it would be not only idiotic it would be malicious to anyone who doesn't know you're being an idiot.

After reviewing the literature you cited and other studies, I will agree that drinking quarts of pesticide formulations containing glyphosate cannot be reasonably said to be harmless.  I will still say that the interviewer was rude and unprofessional. I will not say for certain that Moore was deliberately misinforming people, as that would imply that I could know what Moore knew about glyphosate at the time. It's still possible that he either believed his words or badly misspoke (I can think of times when I've said stuff that stupid and realized it too late).  I will also say that the levels of glyphosate-containing pesticides present on food products at a consumer level are harmless. The only people who need to have any concern about glyphosate pesticide poisoning are farmers who regularly use glyphosate-containing pesticides, and even that is harmless to the farmers if they handle it properly."
GMOMyths,30m8qe,ShillForMonsanto,3,Tue Apr 7 10:56:01 2015 UTC,"I hear you.   The only people who need to have any concern about glyphosate pesticide poisoning are farmers who regularly use glyphosate-containing pesticides   It's interesting that otherwise reasonable people feel comfortable making the assertion that chemicals we use to poison plants and insects and that ultimately end up in considerable concentrations within our habitats are of no concern to human health.  Sure, glyphosate may be a less toxic chemical to humans but the idea that a chemical manufactured to be used as a widespread poison can somehow be considered safe is a ridiculous idea that IMHO science minded people should not be espousing.  We choose these chemicals not because they are safe, healthy or generally ""good"" but because they are less ""bad"" for ourselves and for the environments touched by industrialized farming but they are in no way harmless.  Sorry to rant on that point, I just have a compulsion that forces me to over clarify."
