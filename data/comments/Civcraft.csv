As a short overview for those who have not heard of us before, the Maester Alliance is an order focused on preserving books both by supplying libraries with copies and by storing copies away in safety. We originate from this realm and are settled here, but we also have connections to others**.  We hope that the book both gives a further glimpse into the sometimes mysterious nature of the Alliance as well as serves as a visual example of the possibilites that bookwork actually offers.    The Celebration    As part of the rather modest celebration, 12 originals of the text have been prepared, by hand, for the various libraries of our world to claim for free, as usual with our books.  To claim one, please post in reply to this message, stating the name of your library and the person picking it up. The latter ensures that you will be able to actually access it.  The books are located in 12 chests, one per chest, in our book distribution facility, the Bestowery, in the Hexagon in Fellowship. Its coordinates are as follows: +6150, -2840, 30      *Though months after it actually took place - the Maester Alliance was founded in the fall of 2012.  **MinerApocalypse and CivilizationExperiment, for example."

Once you build a home and start making friends you should start a job; most new people do logging or gathering xp supplies to sell for their first few diamonds. After you get them you should buy a st pick and go mining! I am the leader of Etherium City. Plots cost 30d in town,and you need a reccomendation from 2 major city leaders as our city has one of the biggest defense systems on the server. In paying for the plot, you would be paying the city for your protection. Most of us live in the USA. I personally, am in the cst time zone, and a few residents live in the uk area, so people are on most days all the time. We do have new friend housing available, but you can only stay in the free housing for two weeks until you will be vacated from the park. Two weeks should be enough time to get 30d buy one plot in town. Also, we are not the most new friend ""friendly"" city, but we do watch out for each other and care for one another in our city. We do not steal, kill, or grief. Those are our only laws. Etherium city is located in the -,- quadrant at 3600- 4400-. It is only accessible from the rails from orion or aytos.

Civcraft,3e2e4c,AlliOVERPOWERED,11,Tue Jul 21 15:38:26 2015 UTC,"The actual motivation for the first HCF invasion was a combination of a draft system for map 7 spoiling the map for many players, bad relations between the community and staff, and a general decline in player base due to most new players dying quickly and quitting.  Many of the regulars were on a private subreddit looking for a different server to play on. An invasion wasn't planned, we were just looking for an alternative server. We played on some others and had some fun. Then some players looked into CivCraft. Most weren't interested until some players got banned for breaking into a vault. The drama got talked about in the private subreddit and others went in to help. Before long most people were pearled and 0,0 was taken over using slave labour to break the protected blocks there. Eventually most players got bored and left, and CivCrafters declared victory.  HCF was saved when they put it into the shotbow network which added a bunch of new players, and added some new gameplay features which kept the HCFers occupied. I heard there were more invasions but I'd long since quit playing by that stage."
Civcraft,3e2e4c,Stick,10,Tue Jul 21 13:53:52 2015 UTC,"I'm still subscribed to that sub. Here are some of the comments made when someone suggested CivCraft as somewhere to play.   Its alot like Hcsmp with more plugins. ive played it before, its not very fun.  It seems kinda boring actually... I went on an there really isn't much to do but greif a base or some shit...  Well dang, you had my hopes up there for a second. I appreciate your efforts though. Searching for a new server is tough, but I think we'll find one eventually.   Yea. There was a post on /r/Minecraft today that made the front page about the extremely low quality of almost all minecraft servers, with their vote/pay-to-win setups...  I just saw that post actually, and it seems like a bunch of people really want plain, vanilla minecraft, and HCF is very far from vanilla now. People can't place lava outside their own land, enchanting is partially disabled, and half of the potions are disabled. I think things just got too complicated for people to enjoy it. Seems like something that should be mentioned on the HCF subreddit."
Civcraft,3e2e4c,Stick,10,Tue Jul 21 13:59:09 2015 UTC,"Then this post was made, which actually did stir up some interest.   The other day, I overheard a few people talking about this thing called Civ Craft. I haven't read a whole bunch about it, but I have played for about 4-5 hours now on the server.  Here's where it gets interesting. They have a mod on their server that allows you to ""imprison"" a player if have an enderpearl on your hotbar (or in your inventory, not sure) and you kill them. It essentially ""traps your soul"" and any time you log in after that, you are stuck in the end. The only way to get out is if that player or another player gets a hold of your enderpearl and releases you.  Supposedly there are some people on there that are specifically targeting HCFactions players, and killing them for no reason. They've basically stalked our website and subreddit and they have basically have a hit list.  This is downright unacceptable, and there are already a good number of people that are joining forces to stop this (and by a good number of people, I'm saying players from all corners of HCFactions as a whole are banding together). The final goal of this is to release the HCFactions players that are trapped, and punish those that have dealt out such injustice.  Right now, I know Gordge, Apache, punkrockers, many other absolution, strawhats, badlion, and other faction members are going to work together to basically destroy these individuals and the server in general. There are some unique things about this server that everyone should learn about if they want to join the cause, so here's a link to their subreddit , the server ip is untamedears.com and a final bonus is the only rule for the server is no cheating  If you guys want more information, I'll post more below. My only tip is to not say anything in public chat, as anyone within a 1000 block radius can ""hear you"" and some players are not friendly and have full protection gear. Also, there is no deathban."
Civcraft,3e2e4c,Stick,10,Tue Jul 21 14:04:14 2015 UTC,"Then there was a post titled ""We are at war"". Remember that there were different groups and factions on HCF who were more used to fighting each other than working with each other. This is where that started to change. After this people started posting in a different sub dedicated to the civcraft invasion.   Relay this message to the other members of the group. We are slowly losing due to their organization. They suck at PvP but we aren't using our skill to our advantage. We are disorganized, moving as multiple groups, with no real end goal in mind.  They are picking us off 1 by 1. What are we going to do? It would be really cool if we can actually win this. We may not have as many people but with an organized plan and actual playing when we are all available we can cripple their forces. We have to use map 2 and 3 tactics when pots weren't restricted. Splash healing 2 pots on eachother instead of just on yourself to conserve pots in uneven fights, etc.  This is the people in our group that are not pearled, using known names cause some us are on alts: <names removed> (#) = on server but not working with us yet ?=unsure if pearled or not  We have more people that I might be missing.  Anyways, we should make a plan that doesn't involve sepersting and moving as different groups. We need to move as one. We should also try to get into thr politics even if its too late, it might rally some people to our cause. It doesn't hurt to try.  I propose we stop griefing random towns and killing innocents. Grief ancap territory and start pearling ancaps. I actually like the server and I feel that if we play it right we can last a pretty long time on the server instead of just short time and until we all get pearled. We can try to fix relations while we fight ancaps. I want to prove them wrong and show how strong we are."

Of course it's all an illusion. It's a terrible community which breeds cheaters and encourages people to take extreme measures to win. After all, it ""sucks to suck"" so ghost clients are a must, ddos is apparently a normal thing to do and of course doxing.      The saddest part about HCF dying is that it's entirely meaningless.

It's just a massive collection of cuntish behaviour.    Maybe they did the shit after America, but they still did it which is the point I'm making - a lot of the pvp'ers from those servers are pretty rotten (inb4 duke is a civcrafter - which he is, but he's also typical of the pvp community beyond civcraft)."

Raid HCF caches with allies.  Was never captured during the HCF wars.  Make runs to the end with grassy dirt and supplies for friendlies imprisoned there to beautify the place.  I had just left a PVP server and wasn't expecting to deal with PVP players to the degree that the HCF war brought about. The main problem was vanilla minecraft allows people with not much skin in the game to do a lot of damage. I mostly kept to myself and built fun things underground, but when I could triangulate an HCF base it was raided to great success."

After a few days of hanging out with the wp guys I realized they were all very annoying and I didn't like them, so I betrayed them and joined bloodcrew. From there I played for a few days until Phacad3 and xvs joined bloodcrew, and everybody knows how much I love phacad3 and xvs. So I quit the server for awhile and then came back on alts and raided a lot. From there I used dragoonie to fund my raiding and somehow ended up joining orion. I then proceeded to only play when there was fights.  edit: and I did some raiding on alts while in orion, sorry guys"

At the Orion vault break, celoxia told me they all were not to kill me, I was in gold anyway. I wandered around lost in the forest near Orion, when all of the sudden I see 20 people running towards me on radar. What it was was badash kiting the shit out of like half their fighting force. I pillared up since I was scared, and what happened was straight out of that scene in lion king with all those buffalo or whatever. It was funny as shit. Then an hour later I came and visited their bunker and got stuck, and colonel had to help me get out. Was fun."

However the threat of HCF style human waves is greater than ever now that the chans have cemented their claims on the map, are well geared and highly politically charged. They aren't as inclined to log on and team up for mere PVP fuckery as the HCF invasions were, however depending on the political atmosphere it's still a strong possibility to occur if things down there go sour. We have not seen the last of world wars and I believe that's a good thing, peace is for chumps. oh and Fuck the world police!"
Civcraft,3e0w7n,mclemente26,2,Tue Jul 21 03:13:09 2015 UTC,"The word on the streets is that a World War is right around the corner, at least in Chanada. Most people are well convinced that eventually somebody will start something, but I think that it's almost inevitable as long as the treaties that are in force remain in place. Due to the nature of these alliance treaties, the entire map is only one broken treaty away from a cascade of allies drawing each other into a conflict. The drama in the -,- was just the beginning. Had somebody fucked up up there a few days ago, we could have been in the middle of a full-on GNA-HKE war, plus allies who are called in."

Civcraft,3e0w7n,TheHobbyist94,8,Tue Jul 21 03:23:54 2015 UTC,"In December of 2012, players of a PVP oriented server called ""Hardcore Factions"" came to Civcraft in an 'invasion' and heavily raided and griefed cities together. Because HCF was a PVP oriented server, they mowed down Civcrafters very easily, and many Civcrafters feel HCF changed the server permanently.  There have been subsequent 'invasions' afterwards, but the term 'HCF' has become synonymous with 'invaders' on Civcraft."
Civcraft,3e0w7n,Juz16,4,Tue Jul 21 03:31:15 2015 UTC,"and many Civcrafters feel HCF changed the server permanently.   Can't really argue that it didn't.  Without an invasion of that type, pvp would not have become as important an aspect of gameplay here."

Civcraft,3e0w7n,mclemente26,2,Tue Jul 21 04:39:07 2015 UTC,"It was cool in hindsight but while it was happening it was terrifying. You would wake up every morning IRL and wonder if your city had been turned into a volcano while you slept. Every night you would log out inside your vault so you wouldn't be killed easily the next morning.   Cities would be destroyed and nether portals covered in obsidian in no time at all. It felt like a real war, days of fear followed by short bursts of pure terror when you saw mcfluffykins in the town square on snitches."

Civcraft,3e0w7n,belial418,3,Tue Jul 21 04:20:45 2015 UTC,"Probably not actually: HCF hasn't been nearly as popular/active as it was in its glory days, and most of its audience have moved onto HCTeams, Kohi, and other faction/PVP servers. They'll probably stay there instead of hopping on Civcraft.  Haha, the PVP groups that exist on Civcraft now have codes of honor, i.e. Nox and Eden, which is a change from the unofficial 'World Police' and 'HCF' groups that previously existed with no restrictions on how they operated."

Because Other HCF servers took its place like. Kohi (Main REAson) , HCteams..... Also now a lot of people are addicted to ParaPots. So my reason is if you think thats somehow stopping the HCF community you lot are wrong. I am 1000 percent sure that at the time of the titan war, the hcf guys probably all of them expect 5-6 people were , playing Kohi/Hcteams. Not the original HCF server (shotbownetwork). SO plez if you lot are thinking you will prevent attacks because HCF is Dead LoL. There are other reasons you already know and i am too lazy to write them down. My whole point is We had Lots of fun and is just anoying when people from civcraft act like pussies. Its just funny because if civcraft dies no one in the HCF reddits will give a single sh1t except some people like me who chose to stay in here. So plezzz dont act like a pussy"

I'm happy that HCF splintered because it makes another ReCharge incredibly unlikely. If you think I'm somehow wrong to think this, then tell me why instead of engaging in wasteful name calling.  HCF players might still be active, but they don't have the same motivation the old ones did. They won't put in the effort to organize and attack civcraft."
Civcraft,3e0w7n,Xv1to,-1,Tue Jul 21 11:55:24 2015 UTC,"Also as i said its really funny how you lot take it so serious over a lego game.

People will be like uh...... just a game.....One guy told me just play the way you will have fun, if for you greefing is the fun way than do it , if its being a businessman than do it ..... Anyway you should hold your consequences, not cry when you ve act  like a retard .... And this is why HCF did more damage to you lot than they actually did in game, Because you take sh1t so much serious is like some one burned  your house IRL i mean wtf"
Civcraft,3e0w7n,ProgrammerDan55,3,Tue Jul 21 12:09:43 2015 UTC,"HCF mentality = short term worlds, no consequences  Civcraft mentality = long term worlds, huge time investments per player, severe consequences for actions  You're still exhibiting an HCF mentality (regardless of the incarnation you play on).  The people who truly love and invest in Civcraft recognize that short term thinking doesn't cut it, and that's why ""civcrafters"" despise the HCF mentality. HCF-mentality guys just wanna ""have fun"", damn the consequences.  You burn down my house in Civcraft, it is a lot like burning down my house IRL. I've probably put 200-300 hours of effort into the contents of my Civcraft house, and if you destroy that house, you've just robbed me of those 200-300 hours. See the kind of scale we're dealing with?  HCF servers last what, 2 months? 4 months? Civcraft has had a single continuous world for years now, and it's going to continue.   I realize this might be too deep for you, but please take it at face value and drop the name calling, that's just evidencing your immaturity and it makes me sad.

I would have been glad to pay the amount I was going to pay for Kaiserin as a whole for that land outlined in that picture-if not less because we literally (and I am not saying this just to say it) have no room to expand our oak, wheat, and carrot farm due to how little Forrest biome we have. Its just tundra.   Not that I want to sound bitchy about getting free land, that was a nice gesture. But still, I was willing to pay for just a little bit of land."

We're happy to help new citizens figure out Civcraft, and we have a lot of resources that help us do that.

Volterra found out and issued a letter stating the Senate would be handling negotiations now and that the price would have to be re-negotiated lower since Volterra would be receiving less property than originally agreed upon.  Nova accused them of reneging on the deal and reneged on the deal.
Civcraft,3e0vfj,Roma_Victor,2,Tue Jul 21 08:14:40 2015 UTC,"Really? The deal Volterra mentioned on the sub specifically said ""They have a month to collect their belongings.  Which is rather vague, what exactly did she take that wasn't covered? A vault?"
Civcraft,3e0vfj,MarcAFK,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:25:17 2015 UTC,"I'm not exactly sure since we weren't involved. The only time I heard about it when was Herbie and I were in the Volterran mumble channel discussing rails and other GNA things with Jhill1. Mickale, talking privately to Nova and Jhill, asked if we would leave as Nova was screen shotting the mumble channel and complaining to him that ""SPQR is behind all of this!"".  So of course thinking this wonderfully hilarious and completely stupid thing to demand, wrote up a joke comment directed at Nova telling her to stop being paranoid and to get the fuck on with it. In the 26 to 31 seconds that comment was up Nova had once again checked the channel and flipped shit. She accused Mickale of sharing their private conversation with ""evil SPQR"" and that she ""was done."" She came back later and invented the Volterra reneging to justify her new land deals to Aeon and Hjaltland. That wasn't the initial reason she broke the deal.  I can't really do much beyond shake my head and laugh at this point."

Plots cost 30d in town,and you need a reccomendation from 2 major city leaders as our city has one of the biggest defense systems on the server. In paying for the plot, you would be paying the city for your protection. Most of us live in the USA. I personally, am in the cst time zone, and a few residents live in the uk area, so people are on most days all the time. We do have new friend housing available, but you can only stay in the free housing for two weeks until you will be vacated from the park. Two weeks should be enough time to get 30d buy one plot in town. Also, we are not the most new friend ""friendly"" city, but we do watch out for each other and care for one another in our city. We do not steal, kill, or grief. Those are our only laws. Etherium city is located in the -,- quadrant at 3600- 4400-. It is only accessible from the rails from orion or aytos. Etherium is OP.  -DJ, Arch-Mage of Etherium"
Civcraft,3e0k23,Darkjesusmn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:41:43 2015 UTC,"Hey there! Welcome to the server!  Lots of great cities to join. It's not too complicated to join a city as most people want more citizens. For the most part you just need to show up and ask for land to build on. Some cities charge you for it, others don't. Good newfriend cities are Mount Augusta and Orion, though, it really depends on your political views. I'd be more than happy to help you out in Haven too. Here's a map of the current world: http://txapu.com/  Definitely read the sidebar and learn about the mods. I'm sure most people are willing to help you out once you get to a city."

Civcraft,3dwzib,MarcAFK,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:11:59 2015 UTC,Well the current high xp prices are most of the disparity. Also I last bought ST picks for 20d and E5 for 15 which even then was fairly unusual.

Civcraft,3dwzib,vicccyy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:07:17 2015 UTC,So if I'm understanding this correctly a U3E5 pick or axe would cost 66d per?  And the axes need to be bought in packs of 5?
Civcraft,3dwzib,vicccyy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:33:27 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately yes, but I promised I'd help you guys with some other stuff, so I could maybe go as low as three axes in a deal with you, and I'll cut you a 20% discount. It would be a shame to see Civcraft's premier lumberjack not have proper tools. If you're still looking for slime for a compactor, I'd be happy to throw that in for free, or for that matter just give it to you. Having a compactor in Epicus can only be good for me.  If you want a cheaper E5U3 pick, I  have two that have been repaired once I'll sell to you for 60 each if you take them both."
Civcraft,3dwzib,vicccyy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:35:31 2015 UTC,"Oh no, don't get me wrong!  I'm fine with the price, I'll probably end up buying some from you.  I don't have the time to grind another XP run so it'd be easier to just buy the tools.  Just wanted to make sure I understand the price"

Civcraft,3dnyjv,ajisai,3,Fri Jul 17 20:36:16 2015 UTC,"Copied from my response in the exchange thread -   The problem we have atm is that the price of XP is artificially high. The newer factories are more efficient than their old counterparts (Diamond/Emerald) and yet the prices have gone up 50%+ since the rework.  Once the market settles and people have their outfits running at full capacity again expect xp to drop to 2.5-3d/block.  Assuming 3d upper end per block the XP value of 5 sets drops from 1386 to 924, or 185 ish diamonds per set, a drop of almost 100d from the current price.  But the drop in xp price also drops the value of the factory to 864d, meaning an addition of about 40d per set to recoup factory costs.  Bringing the long term cost of a set of prot to 225 + profit margin, or ~250-260d.  So while yes, the price is inflated atm due to people adopting the new factories before the xp markets have settled, in the long run it should flatten out and drop again.  If it doesn't then me and Mr Clouse shall have a nice discussion about re-crashing the prot market."
Civcraft,3dnyjv,Sempha,2,Fri Jul 17 22:44:34 2015 UTC,"While the efficiency part is not in question, we might do well to not ignore that some of the ingredients have been purposely selected so that they can only be botted with great difficulty; this will undoubtedly keep those prices higher than they previously were because no matter what more manual labor and its associated cost may be involved for these.  I mean, of course you could no-life chopping wood all day to get so many saplings, and fish for salmon all night to show that you don't have to buy them from someone else, but I am not clear that sort of pain is in the cards for most players.  Without really taking a precise look at the ingredients list for all recipes, I intuitively sense that XP price will never quite go back down to what they once were.  In a way it's sort of odd, because I clearly remember all big XP producers bemoaning prices crashing down so low early on in 2.0 history. Personally I think it may be interesting to see how things play out with XP being a bit harder to buy and produce.    ...the experiment continues.   It's very possible that I could be entirely mistaken on all of the above."
Civcraft,3dnyjv,fk_54,7,Fri Jul 17 23:17:50 2015 UTC,The new enchanting system is just awful. Why does something that was free before (enchanting) now have to be ridiculously expensive?
Civcraft,3dnyjv,Itaqi,3,Fri Jul 17 20:59:43 2015 UTC,"even if factories produced one set of armor instead of five for one fifth the cost, I'd be happy.    Also with tools, one tool for one fifth.  I liked grinding out my own XP to make my own set of prot, sword, or tools."

Civcraft,3dnyjv,Itaqi,3,Fri Jul 17 22:50:30 2015 UTC,"I dunno, grinding out 20 sets of prot (for no reason at all, ahem) is soul crushing, especially if you get an unlucky run. Now you just slap the factory a few times while you eat a sandwich or watch Archer and bob's your uncle.  It's just new stuff, people aren't used to it yet. Once a xp powerhouse like Aeon start knocking this stuff out it's going to get stupid, I could easily see Clouse and co throwing out 10-20 sets a day with no problem.  My only negative feedback is that it punishes people that like to self sustain, but aren't interested in selling. This is a mighty expensive factory to make and upkeep for what would likely be one factory run (5 sets) every 6 months of game play.  Or in a small town, one run every month or so. It forces you to either build your town around it, or outsource.   I don't like relying on other people for my gear, but I also don't want to have to throw 1kd at a factory I'll rarely use. Somebody needs to turn 0,0 in the nether into a huge factory room with paid entrance. Tyvm."

This makes perfect sense if you are producing/selling prot and want to justify higher prices, but I don't buy or sell so this is what I would calculate it at instead.  XP doesn't cost 4.5d. Raising the price is more speculation than anything. First, the new cauldrons make it easier to bot and AFK xp, (removing mobs leaves everything else to be crop-based, and even things like saplings are bottable) increasing supply. Second, XP demand for the general population has plummeted with the cost of repairs going down by something like 70% from 1.7 (varying depending on the number of tools you put into each factory run).  Something more reasonable would be 4d per block (new offer here goes for 3.8d per). You might see 4.5d if you're buying at small amounts, but someone producing prot for sale shouldn't be buying at less than bulk to begin with. That lowers your estimated XP cost from 1386d to 1232d, or 246.4d per set.  You also factor in factory building/maintenance costs. For anyone making the big capital investment, it doesn't make sense to split the price over just four factory runs, which is what you are assuming for 20 sets of prot (4 runs producing 5 sets each time). A factory will cost 64d blocks and 96 e blocks, using the 4d/e block price this comes out to be 960d. If you split it into something more realistic (10 runs) it goes to an added cost of 20d extra. However, this doesn't account for the availability of freely available prot factories like in Mt Augusta. So you're going to be competing with people who don't have to make the capital investment or pay for the factory upkeep.  You end up with 246.4 (xp) + 11d (vanilla armor) = 257.4d per set of prot. Realistically, I expect XP to be available at even lower than that for around 3.5 depending on who you buy from. That puts the price at more like 1078 total for XP or (215.6 per), at a total of 226.6d for one suit.  Even factoring in all of that, it still doesn't account for the fact that a ridiculous amount of U3 pieces are still floating around out there. Anyone who was previously in the enchanting business who wasn't throwing their junk prot into lava will be able to skip the U3 enchanting process altogether, at least for the next few months. That's a reduction of 154 XP blocks for those 5 sets of prot. Those 154 blocks shouldn't just be tossed out of the calculation altogether because U3 is still technically worth the same as prot and you could calculate your existing U3 pieces as having that value, but you'll be able to snag quite a few pieces of 'junk prot' for much cheaper than their actual value (probably not now, but yeah..). If you were formerly in the armor enchanting business you could be making new prot sets for a solidly affordable input cost of 118.8d (3.5d per block, no U3). Obviously I wouldn't recommend selling it at that price, because you can mark it up significantly to match the poor saps who don't have any U3 armor saved up and have to pay for it.  TLDR: Prot will cost producers between 120d and 260d to make, not the 340d estimated in the OP. It's entirely plausible that people will jack up prices to 380d, but it's not really a reflection of production costs."
Civcraft,3dnyjv,sintralin,4,Fri Jul 17 21:33:17 2015 UTC,"i stated in op that those u3 pieces that are floating around are of course part of the current price, but as you say, they've found their way off the market. anyone selling those pieces at a discount is uninformed and the market will take care of them eventually. i'm talking long term.   i think you are discussing something else. you are talking about what you can sell, when i'm stating what price you should sell at.  i easily sell my xp at 5d an e-block. sure, i can sell at 3.8/block, but that's selling well under market value. i'm losing out on money that could be made. that is, the market value of those items should not be worth more than the final product. those u3 pieces are worth like 30-40d a piece depending on if it's a helm, chest, etc. you are losing money selling these any cheaper than the price they cost now.  your point about the cost of upstart is very valid, but i don't think people are going to run to mt augusta just to make their own prot. some people like the security of maintaining their own factories and not relying on other cities' capital. time is money, and i'm sure not hauling my ingredients there just to make prot. but again this is what you can sell at, not what a factory maker should sell at."
Civcraft,3dnyjv,sintralin,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:56:39 2015 UTC,"You argue that anyone selling U3 for less than they should is misinformed and the market will take care of them eventually. However, later you make the same assumption that people will continue buying xp at 5d a block when they could be buying it for 3.8d, and that they somehow won't figure this out and the market will never adjust for it. Only one of those two should be true.  You're right that people shouldn't be selling U3 pieces for cheaper, which is why I still include the calculation of 260d (which assumes you are making both p4 and u3 pieces) rather than straight up saying everyone should be buying prot for under 200.  As for upstart cost, with the introduction of the nether and compactors you can very easily haul all of your ingredients to Mt Augusta and make everything there. Also, there should be pretty much zero labor cost involved as it's simply plugging in ingredients into a factory and tapping it with a stick (I understand charging for labor previously in 1.7 but not with the new update)."
Civcraft,3dnyjv,vicccyy,2,Fri Jul 17 22:01:59 2015 UTC,"exactly! /u/vicccyy could dump that xp at 4.5 easily. the point is that just because one person is selling at that price doesn't mean everyone should. you keep talking about what someone can sell at vs what you should sell at.   go to any market. average them out and tell me how much are they selling xp for? liquidity matters, but prot is a very illiquid asset. the time it sits in my chests, the xp used to make it could be sold in shops for much more.   maybe you are right about labor, but i live quite far from a nether portal. i also like to have margins, to have a reward for my work. people are often tempted to just sell on impulse because they want liquid diamonds."
Civcraft,3dnyjv,Sempha,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:16:18 2015 UTC,"exactly! vicccyy could dump that xp at 4.5 easily   Or maybe it's the opposite - they've discovered that a bunch of other people sell at lower and that if they raised their price they'd have a harder time moving their stock. Competition does exist between multiple suppliers, before 1.8 I've never had a problem buying XP at 3 or lower. And I'm not talking small quantities either, this isn't an odd abnormal occurrence."

Imo suits will be ~200-220 in the long run."

Reading all of this wall of text, I can just picture you at the Black Friday sales arguing with the cashier and demanding to be introduced to the manager to triumphantly extort a $0.23 discount on the cashmere sweater because a thread was sticking out.  I mean, there are people out there who like to save as a sport. No question that it's a very respectable activity, one that its devotees can take much pride in, and probably extremely entertaining for a certain segment of the population.   After all, there's already a show called 'Storage Wars' about competing to see what loot you get from buying out people's  delinquent storage rooms full of junk, partially dismantled baby beds, exercise machines and broken dreams.  So the 'Enchanter Battle Royale' show can't be far behind on Civcraft, showing what lengths some players will go to in order to save some diamonds, and all of the cunning and crafty techniques they use to get an edge over their competition and 'win'...

Civcraft,3dmt6d,ProgrammerDan55,2,Fri Jul 17 18:41:19 2015 UTC,I should really add here that it would be more than simply cooler. To my knowledge there are no mods on the server that expose an api for data access out of game (to players). This is almost assuredly intentional. Keep data retrieval in game and let player ingenuity figure out how to harvest it out of game.

We are struggling to get done what's needed and that's the reason why a lot of posts like this seemingly get completly ignored by the development team or just get a comment like ""code it yourself"".

Plus the tons of trees farms that would result from this would use more hoppers and lag the server even more."
Civcraft,3dkn1m,BoomChuckle,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:11:11 2015 UTC,"make tree cutting very easy to bot   The tree farms that already exist aren't much different. You can bot to chop birch trees fairly easily - as birch trees are fairly easy to control the heights of (using glass panes, for example).   Keep the game fun, fair, and playable for everyone.   Firstly, the botting is just as easy but simpler to implement - so public bots would be more likely to form. If when I try to code this I will try to see if I can make a few bot scripts (open source) so people can bot if they want to - and I might see if I can make it a new client mod so you can adjust the coordinates without the setup tool. Having such a high barrier to entry to botting might be why it's ""unfair"" and even possibly why they might cause lag (?)  Secondly, what do you hate more: simply too much wood, which can be easily dealt with, or floating trees and pillars dotting the landscape everywhere? The demand for wood might fall as people start to stockpile - but it's still hard to get rid of floating trees. To this day, a canopy still remains south of Orion that's hard to get rid of - and that's just 1 of the floating tree issues...   use more hoppers and lag the server even more.   True. Bots would probably rely on hoppers. That's why the open bot is an inventory-based one, just loads them into a hopper funnel. No elaborate system, just a funnel. Result? Same amount of lag. Both cases."
Civcraft,3dkn1m,BoomChuckle,2,Fri Jul 17 04:06:45 2015 UTC,"You can bot to chop birch trees fairly easily   Yes, while birch trees can be easy to bot, but they are the only ones like that.  Oak trees are not as easy to bot because of the leaves and the different sizes, and I think it would be best to keep them that way.  I think that the less botting that can be done on the server the better.  When things become bottable, the people with many alts are the ones who benefit the most.  Those of us without tons of alts, or who don't want to deal with macromod shouldn't have to in order to stay competitive.     Secondly, what do you hate more: simply too much wood, which can be easily dealt with, or floating trees and pillars dotting the landscape everywhere?   Just burn the canopies if you can't be bothered to get rid of them any other way.  I want the game to be harder because that makes people have to work together.  Botting makes it not hard for a select few and still hard for everyone else.  Botting makes the wealth gap wider.  Wood cutting and sapling gathering is one of the few things that is in high demand right now that is not easily bottable.  I think we should keep it that way."

Civcraft,3dkn1m,VoiceofTheMattress,2,Fri Jul 17 13:45:35 2015 UTC,"This would allow for the acquisition of wood some 10 times faster than before. That would have a knock on effect of increasing the supply of every material made out of wood by the same value, including charcoal, which is used in almost every factory recipe, and also for keeping pearls locked in chests.   Obviously this has no meaningful effect on some of the more grand aspects and power struggles in civcraft, but I feel it unbalances the game play for the average joe who just makes cool buildings, doesn't care about pvp, and isn't making 100+ diamonds a day.  Further, I actually like that trees float. It means that people who are careless in looking after their territories environment end up having a shitty looking environment. It's one of the few environmental aspects of the civilization simulation.   Second, it's actually very possible to farm trees properly without getting large ones. You just have to build the farm properly. We should be increasing the demand for intelligent designing in infrastructure, not lowering it.  As an addendum in anticipation of someone saying ""but you would say that, Kolima makes money from logs"", no, we don't. Kolima to within my knowledge has never made a single diamond from the sale of logs. We actually have a demand for wood that tends to exceed the current supply, so if anything, this would help us. And in spite of that I am still opposed to it.  Sorry, it's a well fleshed out idea and I can see you've put a lot of thought into it which is good, but personally I think it's bad for civcraft."
Civcraft,3dkn1m,axusgrad,4,Sat Jul 18 01:18:16 2015 UTC,No.  This seems to serve no point what so ever other than to allow people to easily bot cutting trees.  Trees are the last bastion (except for the 1-2 that have now been soiled by botters) of actual manual labor that all of these mods (like RB) are attempting to force on to people.

Civcraft,3diywu,Nightwinga,11,Thu Jul 16 22:22:55 2015 UTC,"Why does the recording only start once the chanadians finally get fed up and fight/fire back?  There was a good 15-20 minutes before vita went rambo and we followed, that shadedjon et al were raining stack upon stack of arrows at us indiscriminately.   My prot was probably at about half dura by the start of the video from arrows alone."
Civcraft,3diywu,polexports,2,Thu Jul 16 20:17:46 2015 UTC,"You guys can't claim you were none combatant... Most of your guys were carrying pots and were there purely because of this conflict. Admittedly if I was online I would have probably have joined in for the hell of it.  The only reason Papa went to MA on one of his most well known alts was because he wanted fighting to break out. Literally the only reason is free is because coal ran out, no shit will the group holding his pearl want it back...  You guys aren't dumb, you wouldn't bring prot to a conflict unless you were willing to use it.  Now Edens actions were questionable at best and also dumb as fuck.  The only victim in this hole ordeal is MA, fuck people using it as a battle ground."
Civcraft,3diywu,Folters,10,Thu Jul 16 21:34:06 2015 UTC,"The only reason Papa went to MA on one of his most well known alts was because he wanted fighting to break out.    Wrong, he's actually been to MA 4 or 5 times prior to that and usually hangs around chatting, following me around while I make bastions, or taking selfies with the locals. Multiple MA residents can attest to this."
Civcraft,3diywu,sintralin,2,Thu Jul 16 21:38:30 2015 UTC,You are telling me you weren't honestly expecting something like this?
Civcraft,3diywu,Folters,10,Thu Jul 16 21:41:11 2015 UTC,"Usually when he shows up in MA it's late at night. This time he came a bit earlier than usual, and shadedjon was in global chat. I told him it was probably best to leave, and he was actually planning to when his internet started cutting out. The Skype call dropped and he was standing in the middle of my basement (not inside the bunker) for a while before the client logged him out. By the time he got back online shaded and belial were already outside my house. Can't really prove anything here (which is why I left it out of my initial post on the subject) but yeah, he has been here before without starting anything and was planning to leave without starting anything."

I am purely pointing out how silly the entire thing is. Turning up to a conflict with prot and a loadout and then claiming you were bystanders.   Now would I have done the same thing? Probably. Papa is a source of income for me, the last thing I want is to see him altbanned.  You were there to protect a friend, end of.   edit: I am also not saying I think what you guys did was right both sides wanted a fight and both sides have people in the wrong."

It seems like there are multiple instances during the video where it is stated by Eden members that Sintralin and anyone else was free to leave, but not Papa?   The spectators in the stands opposite Sintralin's house don't seem to be in danger of being hit by arrows throughout the video."
Civcraft,3diywu,peakman2,11,Thu Jul 16 20:27:16 2015 UTC,"Eden has no authority in MA, and certainly not to evacuate a homeowner and her guests from her own property. I don't even have that power and I'm the fucking autocrat."
Civcraft,3diywu,Prof_TANSTAAFL,-1,Thu Jul 16 22:02:48 2015 UTC,Eden has no authority in MA   And rightly so.   I'm just glad someone had the foresight to designate an area for those who were interested in staying out of the conflict. It undoubtedly kept many people from getting caught in the middle.

Don't really care if you're gay or what just quit being fucking retarded about it, like nobody gives a fuck. When they make a big deal out of it they draw out only the most vocal people and make it worse for themselves. And now like all of the major social shit is like do you support gay rights and trans or no? If you don't you're a bigot and an asshole obviously, only insensitive insecure people disapprove of that, right?   It's just a fucked up sjw situation that both minorities bring out, and frankly I'd prefer having to deal with a gay sjw minority in my country than a feminist sjw minority.

Civcraft,3dgcw5,Juz16,4,Thu Jul 16 14:02:34 2015 UTC,What is Furnaceland? Why do furnaces cause so much lag?
Civcraft,3dgcw5,belial418,3,Thu Jul 16 14:05:08 2015 UTC,"A place made entirely of furnaces.   The game checks every tick to see if each furnace has fuel + something to cook. With that many furnaces, there's a lot to check"
Civcraft,3dgcw5,geohash,3,Thu Jul 16 03:27:56 2015 UTC,It would be so much better if furnaces only started checking when something was put into or taken out of them by hand or by hopper and kept checking until the check failed then waited again until something changed. (You would have the item itself call an update when it was put into or removed from something)

Civcraft,3dhrbf,Langly-,2,Thu Jul 16 12:01:09 2015 UTC,"Just what their timing and amount moved right now is. I know the delay between moving groups of items was increased a while back.  Whats the spot I can read all the current config files, do I need to dig through all of the github files?  Also I know the max range a hostile mob could spawn from a player was reduced a few months back, whats that at? Needed for a passive mob farm placed next to normally active areas. Should only need a single hopper or so as well. Mobs have been spawning so well lately, a couple passive mob towers may be worth it and just light the heck out of the rest of the area.  The other task I had for hoppers was secure drop sites for mining/farming quotas, just run a hopper pipe in 1x1 dro to the storage. So untrusted can drop, and have it move to a safer area. If hoppers get put to near infinite that really won't work and I'd likely have to work out a weird dropper pipe with redstone instead, and that would just be worse :)  Thanks."

So we're basically at the stage where stuff can't even get into the hoppers, it now despawns before it has a chance to since 5 minutes (300 ticks) is the limit?

Civcraft,3dhrbf,fk_54,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:35:44 2015 UTC,"Are you thinking that there could be a contraption offering similar functionality but able to eliminate the lag? How would it sense that there are items to be picked up?  If I understand it correctly, the issue being, what in the contraption would make it less processor-intensive compared to the amount of times per second a hopper must refresh/communicate with server?  Or are we saying that items won't be picked up by a contraption, only be made to travel across transport paths to chests (for example)?"
Civcraft,3dhrbf,ttk2,2,Fri Jul 17 02:41:04 2015 UTC,It won't reduce pickup lag. But it could elimiante chains to carry items to their destinations by turning many hopper chains into a single step. That would be the improvement.

Most VC's begin on the top of it, if it's closer to the center, the higher your slope is allowed to be (like a 4:3 slope) as you're already secure against horizontal breaks, then you need to figure out where you can bulged your vault to compensate for 3d breaks or other non-traditional methods.

Civcraft,3df9zv,crimeo,2,Thu Jul 16 01:06:02 2015 UTC,"That cap doesn't stop a downward autominer from still going just a few blocks off center and still being in range of reaching the chest without any double breaks at the bottom. You'd have to cap at least out to the radius of human reach to actually add virtual layers on for down diggers. Although it will piss them off slightly for having to not purely script the last few blocks.  Similarly, a ridge on the points unless fanning out to the size of human reach, won't stop me from digging straight in from the side off center a bit (or minecarting or whatever) and then digging the last few blocks diagonally without having to fit into the hole (so can be 1x1) and breaking the chest. Annoying, but not actually slowing."
Civcraft,3df9zv,VoiceofTheMattress,2,Wed Jul 15 22:10:09 2015 UTC,"then he has to break the ones at the bottom, it still adds breaks."
Civcraft,3df9zv,crimeo,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:12:44 2015 UTC,"No I mean you dig straight (or minecart or whatever) except offset 3 to the right side, let's say.  Then you get within range of the chest, and since your reach is 3 or 4 radius, you can just dig diagonally a 1x1 tunnel once you get within range of the chest, and bust the chest without ever having to dig a 2x1 person sized tunnel at the end. And wait 5 minutes for pearls to despawn. No extra blocks required. Unless you make a ridge at least as large as my natural reach."
Civcraft,3df9zv,Yoshi_Sama,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:12:18 2015 UTC,"Right, that's still extra breaks, not as many but still extra."
Civcraft,3df9zv,obirnooc,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:15:51 2015 UTC,"Not sure how you figure that. I'm avoiding the ridge entirely, thus entering the un-extra-reinforced vault, using whatever minecart techniques I use until within 2-3 blocks of the chest (which the ridge forced me to the side by). I can reach 2-3 blocks normally, so I can dig 2-3 blocks in a 1x1 tunnel without having to fit into it, i.e. zero penalty versus straight downward digging. Except for having to wait for the pearls to despawn, which shouldn't be a problem."

I have seen some slight player vigilantism in the name of the Tick Rate. I heard some places are worse than others for making useful lag machines. If we had server side confirmation and the who and where the problems are, perhaps we could start an insurgent tick rate war? It would be far better community event than a Vault break.

Civcraft,3ddfh7,volga-river-culture,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:10:26 2015 UTC,"I just don't think that automation is interesting politically.  Politics is essentially the way that humans divide up limited resources (labor and natural resources) right?  At the core, Civcraft's economic mechanics can be (mostly) boiled down to the following:  invest capital into automated system --> receive value over time (sometimes paying upkeep)   Buy an alt and create a farm -->receive farm products  Invest in a factory --> factory processes materials  (Mining for ores is a notable exception, as it is difficult to automate)  The consequence of this is that cooperation and conflict often feel hollow, inorganic. With nothing to fight over or to share (natural resources) and no reason for hearts and minds to be won (labor) how can meaningful politics or forceful conflict take place? Of course, in some ways force and politics are important in Civcraft currently, I just wish that the economic systems reinforced these ideals better.  When a player sets up a bot account to automate their labor instead of competing or cooperating for the control of a limited pool or resources and labor, a range of interesting political interactions are lost.  I believe that the development of yet more automation methods will both unnecessarily increase the complexity of the codebase and also miss the point of an economic and political simulation."
Civcraft,3ddfh7,Sourdust2,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:02:17 2015 UTC,"a compelling argument, so then how would we keep interesting economic mechanics without making them too tedious?"
Civcraft,3ddfh7,joshjosh117,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:48:55 2015 UTC,"I think the best solutions are tightly focused plugins to provide the economic mechanics that Civcraft currently lacks: Natural Resources and Labor.  Basically instead of trying to wrangle Minecraft's mechanics into form, you just pave over them.  Natural Resources – Drama Core  A plugin in the vein of Berge's Deep Resource Extractors but extremely simplified. Pregenerated ""Cores"" situated around the map provide resources (unavailable by any other means) on a regular schedule to those that can maintain control over them.  Here is a simple specification for DramaCore  Labor – Polity Production  Labor is trickier, but here is a skeleton of what I have in mind:  Any player can pay some set amount of resources to create a “Factory” bound to a specific location. Like FactoryMod, there are multiple types of factories, each one transforms one item into another at a certain rate  - again, like factory mod.  Factories require power to function. In order to provide power, a player can pay a coal block and then perform some task that is difficult to automate (possiblity: the worker will be given a set of coordinates within 1 km of the factory, the worker must travel to the coordinates then travel back to the factory before power is provided). The task should take less than 30 min. to perform  Most importantly, each player may only labor once per day. They must choose where to apply their labor.  The more power hungry factories may require 100s of player's labor worth of power in order to function.  Each time a player labors at a factory, their efficiency grows (at a logarithmic rate), if they ever labor at a different factory, any efficiency gains are lost forever. This provides an incentive to cooperate with disagreeable ruler(s). If you are a highly productive worker, maybe you will think twice about jumping ship when your town is occupied.  Factories may also be gradually improved efficiency-wise by paying diamond blocks – again at a logarithmic rate.  The obvious problem with this is that alt accounts are rewarded, however I hope that, for the most part, legitimate accounts outnumber alt accounts and/or judicious alt policy can solve the problem.  The global view  This would be an extremely crude depiction of the final economic web:  http://imgur.com/VlA1yfM  Drama Core and standard mining provide the raw materials that PP Factories consume in order to produce useful things like reinforcement materials and XP  FactoryMod would be out of the picture (Replaced with PolityProduction)  RealisticBiomes would probably not be needed either (as the base of the economy will no longer be based on farming).  Ideally, the ""econ tree"" should flower outwards: If a factory can either produce food or xp from a single drama core resource - say ... ender pearls, then society must decide (in whatever way) what the labor and the raw materials are used for."

If so, there are a few cities that may speak your first language (I know of some Spanish, Russian, and German speaking cities I think). Joining a city with your first language would help you a lot.  Join a city by just wandering into one and asking for a plot (usually)! Most cities have a subreddit you can inquire and communicate on. I recommend posting on a city subreddit before actually going to the actual city. Helps you decide if it's right for you and allows residents to prepare a plot if need be. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask me, I know what it's like to be a newfriend!  As for my own city advertising, if you're into a Dwarven-like city, New Senntisten is an underground city with a mostly stone/iron building code that looks pretty neat.

Civcraft,3dcl7l,Prof_TANSTAAFL,0,Mon Jul 20 15:42:39 2015 UTC,That sounds really absurd.
Civcraft,3dcl7l,VoiceofTheMattress,0,Mon Jul 20 15:54:57 2015 UTC,"Proving Papa's guilt doesn't change the fact there's nothing illegal about Sintralin hiding a criminal in her house and because of the anti-griefing and trespassing laws, it's technically illegal for them to step on the property to pearl Papa and illegal to break any of the blocks of her house to gain access.  Making private property in MA a defacto criminal safe haven that's protected by the MA government because people attempting to catch the criminal will get criminal charges pressed against them"
Civcraft,3dcl7l,TheJD,4,Wed Jul 15 15:11:42 2015 UTC,"That's not quite accurate. Yes, it's true that there's no provision in the criminal code explicitly allowing people to trespass or destroy property in pursuit of a criminal, but long-standing precedent dictates that it's fine as long as the pearling was justified in the first place."
Civcraft,3dcl7l,Prof_TANSTAAFL,4,Wed Jul 15 15:24:14 2015 UTC,"I saw nothing of the sort listed in any of the case precedents, specifically, when the private property isn't the criminal's being chased."
Civcraft,3dcl7l,TheJD,2,Wed Jul 15 15:27:04 2015 UTC,"Which cases specifically? To the best of my knowledge no one has ever been convicted of trespassing or griefing in the apprehension of a criminal, as long as their actions were the minimum required to pearl the suspect.  To cite a recent example, out of the crowd that pearled tooiko and raided his house, not a single person was convicted of trespassing or of griefing for breaking blocks to gain entry into his house. They were, however, convicted of theft and griefing for breaking/opening chests on the property, actions that were not required in order to pearl tooiko."
Civcraft,3dcl7l,Prof_TANSTAAFL,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:35:08 2015 UTC,"Thank you.  Just an FYI, I was looking at this list since I assumed anything considered a ""precedent"" would be listed there.  Are you referring to the part that states ""  This should not be construed as a trespassing clause; entering another individual's property is not necessarily a crime, but actions taken while there may be -- opening chests, failure to leave when requested, breaking blocks or placing blocks, etc.""?  Is that precedent supposed to be implying that actions (entering property, breaking/placing blocks) taken (specifically, actions required) to capture a criminal aren't illegal?"
Civcraft,3dcl7l,TheJD,5,Wed Jul 15 15:40:15 2015 UTC,"Is that precedent supposed to be implying that actions (entering property, breaking/placing blocks) taken (specifically, actions required) to capture a criminal aren't illegal?   Correct.  People do not get convicted for any necessary action taken to capture an individual reasonably suspected of a crime under Augustan Law.   If evidence of the required standard for the crimes Papa has allegedly committed is presented, anyone trespassing on sintralin's property with the clear intent of capturing him will not be convicted for it. If anyone trespassing was after someone who was not reasonably suspected, they can be convicted.  Any unnecessary action, like placing or breaking blocks without the purpose of trying to reach the suspect, or popping chests unless they are clearly blocking the path to the suspect, is considered criminal action."
Civcraft,3dcl7l,Ladezkik,2,Wed Jul 15 16:07:32 2015 UTC,"No, that's only a list of what was considered case law at the time of that particular amendment to the criminal code. The fact is that actions taken in the pearling of a suspected criminal are a huge gray area, since all that's really required is ""reasonable suspicion"" which is obviously fairly subjective and open to interpretation. In most cases, it ends up being pretty straight forward. The majority of people we pearl are newfriend griefers, and most of us will go after them based purely on the word of another trusted citizen, with the understanding that snitch logs etc. will be presented at the trial. I can assure you that if someone commits a crime in MA, then retreats onto private property, you will not be convicted of a crime for going after them if you have evidence that meets the requirements for burden of proof."

Eden members are supposed to put any actions they want to take to a vote before the entire group before they take those actions. That was not the case in this incident. The group that took part in the actions in Mt. A did not even notify the other members of the group that they were taking these actions, much less put them up to a vote. The entire group at Mt.

If papa's claims that are left are muh end time reps, then i expect every person pearled last night to receive the same. Its not hard to not enter a city and try to fight people all day. I do it every single day when i log in to play civ. But some people cant resist getting in the middle of everyone else's business.

As for the Channers, soccer you weren't there.  They were forming a meat shield.  We painstakingly and at great risk followed Mount Augustan law and didn't enter Sintralin's property.  These Channers were not bystanders, they were active participants.   Trust me, you'd have done the exact same had the situations been reversed.  As for Papa's endtimes, I talked to him and explained that if pearled here, he'd face justice in Mount Augusta, where he could argue against End Time reps and the rest of us, especially Eden, will follow the ruling.  We've slunk back with our tail between our legs.  We're trying our best to fix it. Give us half a chance, I think we can do it."

Their isnt a law against making a circle around a person. Also i dont trust the citizens of MA, especially with all of the recent eden members that have become citizens to not extradite the pearl to an eden vault where i know papa will be perma pearled. Also you guys did enter sintralins property, but itsnot a big deal, trespassing is a minor crime."
Civcraft,3dcl7l,Soccer37222,2,Wed Jul 15 07:32:00 2015 UTC,Are shield bearers combatants?  Probably not in Augustan law to be honest. If anyone actually wants to pursue reps or end time they need to go through the mount Augusta courts. If anyone feels they have been wronged by a certain member that hasn't been detained they need to let us know.
Civcraft,3dcl7l,dhingus,4,Wed Jul 15 13:15:30 2015 UTC,"Probably not in Augustan law to be honest.   Depends.  If Augustan Justice concludes that Papa was committing crimes while they were forming a meat shield, they can be charged of assisting in said crimes.  If it is concluded that Papa was not committing crimes in MA, they cannot be charged for being in the way.   Even if evidence for Papa's past crimes meet the standard required for reasonable suspicion under Augustan Law, which is required to justify trying to pearl him, the meat shield cannot be charged for being in the way."

Absolutely accurate, and as the ruler of a neighboring state I'll add this: it's not hard if you have proof. I had snitch logs and a confession from Sparky when I got in contact with MA's leaders and got permission to pursue and pearl him on MA territory almost immediately.  The only reason there would be to not do this would be if you know you lack sufficient proof to convince the Mayor and Judges of your target's guilt."

Anybody pearled within Mount Augusta would have been tried in Mount Augusta, and all those who were pearled are in a Mount Augustan Vault.  We answer to our own members first, then to those we have wronged.  For this reason, Shaded has turned his pearl over to Mount Augusta while the Tribunal is being set up.  If you take a look at our roster, you'll see several voices of opposition to the traditional world police, myself included.  So consider that when calculating the odds of Shaded and Max being let off scot free."

On the note of the 'chanadian turtle', is doesn't matter if Nox/Chanada would have done the same thing if in your shoes, what matters is that YOU guys did it and with the responsibility Eden has for server wouldn't you expect better from them? I'm disappointed that you're trying to cover up your actions by saying 'we're new' or that 'we're doing better than the last WP' Because apparently Eden was suppose to stop the trouble that WP was causing, but to me it seems like you've just drowned it out by having multiple respected members of the community defend the CoolPvPers, people whom before scolded them for the same."

FYI, Papa logged off for a full hour precisely because he didn't want to get caught up in any bullshit. I went back to finishing the nether rail from MA to Nox. He doesn't want to risk an alt ban, and considering his internet disconnected a few minutes after he showed in the MA he wasn't taking any chances. The Chanadians contacted us after the pictures that your members, Shaded and Belial posted on the subreddit went up and asked if we needed any help.

Civcraft,3dc7hv,johnnyalpha1234,14,Wed Jul 15 03:59:20 2015 UTC,"When I started playing, back in 2012, tick was like 3-4tps at busy times. That was before the Citadel RAM cache, asyncing a lot of our plugins - hell it was before threaded chunk loading in spigot. In some ways it's a testimony to the success of the devs in the last 18 months that high tick (>13tps) has become the norm.   But when we nerf portal farms, some people redesigned them and some people complained about the nerf. When we reduced obfuscation ranges, people said it made the game unplayable. When we fixed RealisticBiomes to make it more efficient, people built bigger farms. When we reduced view distance, people used more alts to keep chunks loaded, adding entity strain to boot. We relaxed Nocheatplus, which is the main reason players notice low tick, but then people cheated.   Ultimately it's an arms race. Every time the dev team finds a way to speed up the tick, players will expand enormous machines, portal farms etc until it slows again. One reason why tick isn't perfect even with low player numbers is that even during low-traffic times the bots are running and the automated machines are cranking their pistons, using their hoppers and moving entities around. That said, we've found that tick always suffers once player numbers top 125 or so, just because of the move events, chunk loading etc.   Sharding will hopefully be the most dramatic increase in tick since Citadel caching. It's going to create its own set of problems, but it should deal with most of the pressure on the tick by breaking up the main thread.   Until then you have options. You can help with sharding if you're a programmer. You can post coding bounties if you have money and want to speed the process. You can stop heavy industry by lobbying, pressuring players, passing laws, actively destroying machines and portal farms or buying them out and dismantling them. You can stop playing if you can't bear a less-than-perfect user experience. Or you can just deal with the lower tick, knowing that developers and others are trying to fix it."
Civcraft,3dc7hv,MCCiv,2,Wed Jul 15 09:46:07 2015 UTC,"So if an eco warrior group were to spring up, what sort of things would they target?

Civcraft,3dc7hv,VoiceofTheMattress,2,Wed Jul 15 10:58:52 2015 UTC,100 is less than 1% of 1% of the lag tiles entities cause.  However if you really want to be an eco warrior targeting the red stone mechanism that automate the firing of pistons is best. Not breaking them but slowing them down by 10x. Owner might never notice and you just reduced the lag by 90%
Civcraft,3dc7hv,ariehkovler,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:35:08 2015 UTC,"I believe we release lightly-censored timing data every now and again. That would have information about what is causing lag.

Civcraft,3dc7hv,VoiceofTheMattress,2,Wed Jul 15 11:24:05 2015 UTC,"I actually think contraptions will be bigger, if we can replace pistons, hoppers and bots all with the sameish class of contraptions it might reduce the number of connections and the lag from the blocks.

Civcraft,3dc7hv,ariehkovler,2,Wed Jul 15 21:33:28 2015 UTC,"In the short-term, maybe - but note   we've found that tick always suffers once player numbers top 125 or so, just because of the move events, chunk loading etc.   That stuff won't be helped much by contraptions - we couldn't comfortably break 200 players, say - but with sharding we probably can.

Civcraft,3dak08,VisonKai,11,Tue Jul 14 20:05:49 2015 UTC,I'll be turning my pearl in to the Judges in Augusta in case anyone wants to submit a case against me.
Civcraft,3dak08,Folters,15,Tue Jul 14 19:54:44 2015 UTC,"Same,  I will hand in my pearl if required to by the Mount Augustan legal system. I take full responsibility for my actions as the Eden Master-at-Arms and will serve any punishment required to by Eden or Augusta.  Edit: Here is what I posted in the Eden subreddit. I'll post it here as well as I believe it is appropriate considering the situation.   I take full responsibilty for the actions at Augusta. Despite being the Master-at-Arms and having the authority to order everyone from Eden to stand down, I did not, and instead proceeded with the siege.  Despite Papa being wanted and having open claims, this was a still poor showing by us and did not serve to advance our organization's interests. My hesitance to pull our fighters out brought shame and dishonor upon Eden, and I apologize to our members, allies and friends for letting them down and having them wake up to a shitstorm they had no part in brewing. All this skirmish did was light the fires of an old conflict and erode our legitimacy to the public, although I am hopeful that Hobby's post will help salvage much of our good will. I am however, fully responsible for this operation as I did not pull out our fighters and instead lead them in this siege.  Know this however; I made every attempt to minimize damage and restrict collateral damage. I never ordered shaded to place cobwebs in the nether factory, I only suggested to him that we use it on Papa on some place like the road. Shaded can confirm this and give you the exact PM I sent to him. This wasn't a super-secret WP illegal operation; we had judges and citizens in the channel the entire time and did everything we could to be transparent. I hope no one will accuse of trying to shit on Augusta's sovereignty because there is nothing to support that; everything is being handled under Augustan law and we were very frank with the judges, so much as to have them in our mumble channel during the entire thing.  I am however, fully responsible for this operation as I did not pull out our fighters and instead lead them in this siege. I regretted it then and I regret it now. I don't want this group to fail and I will do what is necessary to demonstrate that we are willing to stick to our charter and mete out punishments where necessary. I don't think stepping down from my position will help but I am willing to do it if the group demands it. I would still like to be in the group however; I still believe I can help the group achieve its goal, perhaps in another role or capacity if necessary.  As part of my leadership in this shitshow I am willing to front the cost of reps if they show up. I don't want to write a cheque and be unable to cash it so we'll see what the total costs look like, but rest assured I will pay for more than just my own personal actions. We have to be consistent; we give so much shit to Papa for having the main leadership role in Titan and demand a lot of reps based on that, it is only fair that I hold myself accountable in the same way."

Civcraft,3dak08,Folters,10,Tue Jul 14 20:11:16 2015 UTC,"Papa returns. Arrows are intermittently shot into the house which was confirmed to be legal, since it was not griefing under Mt A law.   Apparently not"
Civcraft,3dak08,Soccer37222,8,Tue Jul 14 20:15:59 2015 UTC,"This is a grey area in Augustan law, but I think they are on the right side of it if the only arrows hit Papa. The reason they couldn't enter Sin's property was because it would be trespassing. There were two issues with arrows:   Are they griefing? Since griefing requires a ""wilful destruction of property"" as per our definition, no. Do they violate security of person? Criminals with outstanding claims have been exempt from this in legal precedent. As long as they didn't violate Sintralin's security of person, they're fine.   That said, it appears that Sintralin was in fact hit while in her house, which is where the point of contention will be. Once all the evidence is available the Augustan judges will consult with each other and try to form up a general response to the events of last night."
Civcraft,3dak08,Folters,5,Tue Jul 14 20:22:22 2015 UTC,".    Do they violate security of person? Criminals with outstanding claims have been exempt from this in legal precedent. As long as they didn't violate Sintralin's security of person, they're fine.    Would not the mere fact of having to dodge arrows within one's own home justify violation of their security and safety? Regardless of whether said arrows hit the owners, bystanders, or criminals within said property. They are still under threat of being struck by incoming fire."
Civcraft,3dak08,Soccer37222,3,Tue Jul 14 23:13:21 2015 UTC,"In addition to this there is also a section of the constitution that says pot shooting people with bows is illegal. In the bill of rights, section v subsection iii it states the right, ""to be free from all forms of violence either public or private sources"". This seems like a very key point to this situation as many people were exposed to forms of violence on both sides."

Civcraft,3dak08,Morukil,4,Tue Jul 14 20:27:40 2015 UTC,TIL assault isn't a crime in mount augusta!
Civcraft,3dak08,GTAIVisbest,6,Tue Jul 14 20:13:48 2015 UTC,"Haha well it's complicated.  So normal assault, if you're just firing at people yes that's assault.  However, I guess attacking Papa since there are open claims isn't explicitly against the law.  But, entering Sintralin's property to do so is against the law.  So we were in this frankly weird legal situation where he was safe inside the house except for arrowfire.  I don't know it's all a pretty muddy piece of law."
Civcraft,3dak08,Folters,3,Tue Jul 14 20:15:34 2015 UTC,"Depends entirely on if the claims on Papa are legally sound in Mount Augusta. If there is reasonable suspicion of a person committing or having committed criminal acts, trespassing in pursuit of them and/or attacking them in a private property is generally looked over.  If the claims are sound, the people shooting might as well have been within the plot.   If not, certain individuals could still be charged for assault for shooting arrows and trespassing."
Civcraft,3dak08,Soccer37222,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:27:24 2015 UTC,"Assault is a crime in Mount Augusta under Section 600 -- General Crimes -- of the criminal code.  As has been stated, the only exception is if the assault occurs during the apprehension of a criminal; in this case, both the criminal and the would-be-bounty hunter have no basis for claims of assault or murder (example: I was murdered while pursuing a criminal, but I could not charge him with that murder due to this exclusion. Similarly when he was pearled, he could not charge his pearler, under the same clause)."

Civcraft,3dak08,volga-river-culture,7,Tue Jul 14 20:50:55 2015 UTC,"Papa did not make the effort to get away without fighting.   Ah yes, I too enjoy walking alone out into a crowd of demigod PVPers who hate me, relying entirely on their goodwill and peaceful natures to keep me safe from being perma-pearled.  Did you really think that through? Are you saying that - with the house surrounded by his enemies - Papa_Pound should have walked out without an escort if he really wanted to leave? He'd have left alright - in a pearl destined for Playpen without hope of paying reparations. Calling for Channer aid to escort him out was the only chance he had to leave without being pearled.  Why should he want to leave? Maybe because there is no guarantee Eden wouldn't have broken into the place eventually.   with the exception of the Cobweb placing for which Shaded and Max will face justice, no crimes were committed   Every time Sintralin was pearled was a crime. Every time Mokotan/MuffinPimp was killed it was a crime. The whole goal of the operation - to pearl Papa_Pound - would have been a crime had it been accomplished.  Eden was there to break the law. Their primary goal, if accomplished, would have been illegal. Crimes were being committed all over the damn place. We had bleachers set up to watch it happen. This is just an outright lie, unless you think murder isn't a crime in Mount Augusta. And Eden came to commit murder.   Trust in me and the others in the group who joined to review this exact shit to do our damn best to make sure we learn and hold troublemakers responsible   I have no trust in that. It's not that I don't think you or Dan or whoever else signed on in the futile hope of keeping these people in line are incapable - it's that I think they will do their best to circumvent you, marginalize you, or outright even ignore you. Tell me Hobbes, did they vote on this beforehand? Did they follow their charter that they staked their reputations on and vote before coming after him? Or is this the first you learn of it - after the fact, when the damage is already done, and you can't do jack shit to reign them in?  You make the mistake of thinking anything has changed. These are the same PVPers who have always been in the World Police. They have raided on alts, they have pissed on national sovereignty, they have no respect for any law that is not convenient to them. The law says you can't pearl Papa_Pound in MA without proving to MA's court system he's a criminal? Fuck the law, come down and try to pearl him anyways! After all, it's for the good of the server, right? Everything is justified because it's for the good of the server.  I have ranted on this before. It's enshrined in your mandate. Eden does not care about national laws when they get in the way. If they didn't vote to declare Papa_Pound a target then they don't even care about their own laws. They simply skip over that bureaucratic mess and leap into battle.  Eden came to pearl Papa_Pound knowing it was a crime. Whether he has claims on him - and from what I've seen those claims are at this point unsubstantiated whining about how so-and-so lost a prot set while attacking a city - is irrelevant. Instead of going through the courts they jumped straight to the sword, and screw the law. And that's all that will ever happen, so long as these people think they're justified.  They turn their pearls over for punishment. What does it matter? They have alts. They would do the same thing again in a heartbeat. They get released, they pay some diamonds. They rebuild the tiny fraction of their wealth that was lost in it and are set to go again. Nothing is accomplished. Nothing is changed."
Civcraft,3dak08,Thoths,2,Tue Jul 14 20:44:49 2015 UTC,Papa did not make the effort to get away without fighting.   I think he's implying he could have just logged off instead of coming outside to get attacked.
Civcraft,3dak08,sashimii,7,Tue Jul 14 20:48:21 2015 UTC,"Your argument: Papa should have just logged out  He logged off for almost an hour, during which Eden not only did not leave, but also dug up the road outside my house and cobwebbed it. I left too, and returned because I have a home in Mt Augusta and shouldn't be intimidated or threatened simply for returning to it.  Why is it his responsibility to log off? Proof was demanded of the crimes he had committed. No proof was provided. If someone randomly shows up and starts shouting that I'm wanted, with zero proof, is it my fault if I don't immediately log out for fear of being pearled? MA guarantees the right of all people (citizen and non-citizen) to freedom and security. He shouldn't have to log off because someone in Eden felt like being a powertripping asshole.   From Sintralin's comment. No sense wasting time writing more when she's put it better."

Civcraft,3dak08,GeneralWhoever,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:01:29 2015 UTC,Papa has not committed any crimes in MA. He has committed crimes again MA citizens (belial being a part owner of playpen) but papa would not be guilty of any crimes in just MA.
Civcraft,3dak08,Bob_The_Cat,5,Tue Jul 14 20:26:41 2015 UTC,He can still be tried for crimes or extradited. Regardless the law is clear that if the pearl is captured in MA territory it needs to go through the courts.

JustinSavage   JasonSavage  Your assertion: Papa and CMC had prior claims  Eden members were there for well on THREE HOURS. Shadedjon and Belial were there for an hour before ANY fighting broke out. NO material claims were presented during this time. They continued to simply say that Papa was a criminal because of ""America, Titan etc"" despite the many times that he told them he had paid every claim and was in negotiations with their Eden commander over the rest (which were either indirect, end time reps based, or reps paid for other Titan participants).

Do your due diligence and actually give specific claims. From what I can remember he had claims from Itaqi for fighting at Titan, XP mat destruction at Carson, and a shitton of end time claims for a vault he didn't have access to, from people he didn't pearl. Itaqi and Carson were paid.  Either way, CMC's presence is entirely irrelevant as he logged out before the fighting even escalated.  Burden of proof lies on the prosecution. When they had over 3 hours to turn up ANYTHING and either refused or were unable to, it makes no sense that I or any other person there should take their word for it and treat Papa or CMC as criminals.  Your assertion: Arrows shot into the house are legal  Sure, shoot at Papa if you want. But when I stand literally on my front door and get an arrow to the head on my own property (you can even see the black stained clay and quartz behind my head) you have assaulted someone on private property who was not aiding/abetting someone in a criminal action. This happened before any general fighting happened - Papa was shot and a few minutes later I was shot (12:51 am). No swords were drawn until a full hour afterwards (1:55 am). The only reason whoever did that isn't being charged is because I survived and the combat tag didn't tell me who it was. So a full HOUR after someone on the Eden side had attacked me at my front door, no one at Nox had done anything.  Your implication: Zero is with Vita/Nox and initiated the fighting  The player 00-Zero-00 is not representing or acting on behalf of Nox. He was removed from the Nox group 2 days prior over personal disagreement between me and him (he killed my pet rabbits in the tower and was a total asshat about it). Petty, whatever, but fact remains he was kicked out of the group and removed from all permissions. He was probably still logged in Nox territory. I can provide chat logs and snitch proof of him killing my animals, verifiable by a neutral (non-Nox) third party at request. He is not welcome in Nox. In fact, he shows up in Mt Augusta and his second act after attacking Max is killing and pearling me. I dropped factory materials that I was carrying back to the house and only picked them back up because (I assume) his inventory was full of pots.  A rogue actor coming in and attacking does not justify open warfare on the rest of the people present. He also does not ever return to the house after fighting. That is simply false. He did not have permissions to the door or bastions. Even Roguex7 testified in a different thread that he ran towards the Cove, which is the opposite direction from my house.  Your accusation: Chanadian Turtle  Not much to say here apart from the fact that I approve of this name. I would like to point out that they clearly showed up in protest of Eden actions, and the MA bill of rights guarantees the right of people to engage in peaceful protest. The 'turtle' was not violent until Eden started firing on them.  Your claim: Shaded and Max committed a low-level griefing crime  Agreed here. Just want to point out that by Eden's public statement, any member determined to have griefed is in violation of the mandate and does not meet membership requirements. Stripping of membership is a tad bit more than simply 'disciplinary action', which is typically what you'd associate with 'they said something bad for PR so we'll shout at them' rather than 'they griefed a structure worth several thousand diamonds and someone died as a result'.  Your argument: Papa should have just logged out   He logged off for almost an hour, during which Eden not only did not leave, but also dug up the road outside my house and cobwebbed it. I left too, and returned because I have a home in Mt Augusta and shouldn't be intimidated or threatened simply for returning to it. Why is it his responsibility to log off? Proof was demanded of the crimes he had committed. No proof was provided. If someone randomly shows up and starts shouting that I'm wanted, with zero proof, is it my fault if I don't immediately log out for fear of being pearled? MA guarantees the right of all people (citizen and non-citizen) to freedom and security. He shouldn't have to log off because someone in Eden felt like being a powertripping asshole.   Your argument boils down to nothing more than 'you should have known better'. 'You should have known better than to walk around with a big wad of money and expect not to get mugged.' Something seem wrong with that statement?"

Civcraft,3dak08,dsclouse117,2,Wed Jul 15 03:50:50 2015 UTC,"Don't really have a great answer for you myself. The tentative system we have for this in Nox is splitting it into a criminal and civil issue. Once someone is convicted of the criminal charges (much easier IMO - screenshot of combat tags, pearlings, death screens, snitches, etc) they are then transferred to the appeals court where the victim and the convicted can argue about how much is owed. Screenshots are by far the best way of proving it (I always take screenshots of my inventory when I see someone hostile or suspicious lurking around, or even when I'm about to AFK in a minecart with valuables). If you lack them, context for a situation can often substitute - it's reasonable enough that someone participating in major fighting would have 1.5-2 sets of prot, not so reasonable they have 5 sets, or a stack of diamond blocks."
Civcraft,3dak08,Bob_The_Cat,5,Wed Jul 15 09:17:34 2015 UTC,"What I don't understand is how Eden can ultimately decide which claims/bounties are or aren't legit.

What makes their pursuit of Papa okay, and ours of Vito not okay?"

Civcraft,3dak08,daddo69,5,Tue Jul 14 20:56:11 2015 UTC,"I like you, so I'm not going to argue quite as I otherwise would, since I know you're just doing what you do as a fancy lawyer, and I wouldn't want to crush your soul.    However, when jakebob and eldoorn attacked Clone, and itaqi and craddragon came to Clone's defence, were itaqi and craddragon deemed criminals by the WP? Or was it spun around by WP as Libertas being filthy bad guys and owing them reps? It was the latter if I recall!    When a few chanadians went to Aeon to pursue a bounty (which was allowed) on bongo or yuntay (idr), and DrLecter came to Bongo's defence, did we pursue DrLecter for aggressing upon us? No, because Aeon permits the defence of its citizens/friends/guests even if they have bounties on them and those bounties are allowed to be hunted, or so that's what Dsclouse said. Something along those lines anyway. We dropped the issue and went on our merry way.    Does Mt. Augusta have laws stating that it is a crime to stand in front of a person who is not wanted in Mt. Augusta, but is wanted by Eden, while Eden shoots arrows at them, or directly assaults them with swords even if they're not directly blocking the criminal? If not, then they are quite innocent.    Regardless, as Chanadian citizens, Chanada feels that they did not commit any moral wrongs by standing in front of a friend. Again, this isn't even about the arrow fire, that's understandable to a degree, this is about targetted pearling with swords done by people, who as a group, have wronged us many times. Unjust aggression against our citizens is not tolerated.    Edit: What's worse is that this was not even an Eden-sanctioned event. The aggressors were acting in violation of the Eden Mandate, and are just flat out griefing/raiding."
Civcraft,3dak08,polexports,0,Tue Jul 14 21:27:17 2015 UTC,"senpai noticed me :3  But yeah that currently how we roll. If someone has a bounty and is in Aeon, come get them. If they get protected by someone who is here or someone that shows up from elsewhere then that's something the bounty hunter has to deal with. It's not a perfect system, it's not even remotely good, but it's how we do.  Things will be changing soon in Aeon though so this standard won't be the case much longer most likely."

Let me get this straight... You may (or may not) press charges - on people surrounding an individual who has every legal right to be in mount augusta, for simply being there?

I'm usually a fairly patient person but over three years you end up being pretty much done, yeah? I can be polite, helpful, friendly, etc. But to people who repeatedly show themselves as assholes, liars, and scumbags while playing dumb yet knowing exactly what they're doing in order to get a rise out of someone, that drives me up the wall. So of course I'll be a dick, of course I'll be corrosive and belligerent. Newfriends? No problem, I'll even be patient and kind and show them the ropes. Certain others? Absolutely not.   Besides, what did I even say that was solely to stir shit and spread misinformation? Asking how an organization which was created to hold its members accountable for crimes is going to hold its members accountable for crimes?   Get off of your high horse and take a look at the people you associate yourself with."

Civcraft,3d9fzk,Lysika_Lantariel,3,Tue Jul 14 19:03:04 2015 UTC,"What kind of evidence do we need against Papa, exactly?  Eye witness testimony from a dozen people?  What if he admits his crimes?"
Civcraft,3d9fzk,TheJD,8,Tue Jul 14 15:27:36 2015 UTC,"Eyewitness testimony, snitch logs, admission of guilt, anything is admissible really.  Of course, if it's true that he really has been making a good faith effort to pay reps, and you guys are still pushing for a perma-pearling, that's not going to go over too well either. We just voted down an extradition to Kaiserin the other day over concerns about the fairness of their justice system, even though there was snitch evidence of wrong-doing. I have a feeling it's going to take a very convincing argument to get the voters to turn anyone's pearl over to Eden after this debacle."
Civcraft,3d9fzk,Lysika_Lantariel,2,Tue Jul 14 15:35:32 2015 UTC,Should I (and others) be posting this all in here or is MA going to have an official court thread?
Civcraft,3d9fzk,TheJD,5,Tue Jul 14 15:40:22 2015 UTC,"Here is fine for now. I'm asking for my own reference. Papa indicated that he might be willing to turn in his pearl to me if requested, but I'm not convinced that it's necessary at this point."
Civcraft,3d9fzk,ribagi,2,Tue Jul 14 15:44:21 2015 UTC,We have to prove from first principles that Titan happened and was led by Papa.     I imagine linear algebra has the required tools.     edit: should probably add that this is a joke and no one needs to be murdered.

I'd rather not waste my time...<sigh>...proving Titan happened...if your statement will clear up what happened.  Edit:  Also, if you prove Papa has legitimate claims against him Mount Augusta has a ""Materially assisting anyone via donation of goods, materials, or other aid (snitch network access, etc.) with the goal of causing the above shall be prosecuted as the same"" clause on most of their crimes meaning anyone actively defending him could potentially be charged with the same crimes."
Civcraft,3d9fzk,Folters,5,Tue Jul 14 16:36:54 2015 UTC,"Mind that the clause only applies to people actually assisting an individual to commit criminal acts as they happen, or in preparation of such acts.  A handful of people defending him now does not implicate them for his past crimes.  Unless you have charges of criminal actions that Papa took yesterday in Mount Augusta, and a clear case of how people were helping him commit or prepare these acts, you cannot apply the assistance clause to the people who were present on his side."
Civcraft,3d9fzk,TheHobbyist94,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:53:04 2015 UTC,"Well, if they had legitimate reasons to pearl Papa wouldn't that mean all of the people who defended him were committing assault?"

If any players were simply in the way as meatshields (sintralin), then there's little in the criminal code that they can be charged with, unless it is clear that this action was assisting Papa in assaulting other players, in which case they could also be charged with assault."

Civcraft,3d8zvm,Lysika_Lantariel,8,Tue Jul 14 13:28:21 2015 UTC,"Firstly, that comment was in reference to pedophiles.   It's unfortunate, but yes, I do believe the kindest and safest thing to do is to euthanize them. Pedophilia is a sexual orientation that cannot be changed by therapy (you can't change sexual orientation), all pedophiles will likely end up molesting a child at some point in their life, even ""non-practicing"" pedophiles who recognize the wrongness of their desires are vulnerable to giving into to their desires at certain times.    Obviously I am comparing the two, but you can't ""treat"" pedophilia anymore than you can treat homosexuality. A gay man who attends sexual conversion therapy will still be gay, they may be able to get him to suppress the behavior, but the desires remain, and he'll eventually probably give in and fuck another man at some point. The same applies for pedophiles who seek treatment, and this time there will be a non-consenting party involved when the patient gives into their urges, and a young life will likely be ruined.    Pedophiles are too dangerous to be part of society, and personally I think euthanasia is more humane for the pedophile than life in a mental hospital.   Secondly, I think it's inappropriate to go through a users Reddit history and reproduce their messages from unrelated subreddits without context in an effort to cause controversy. Yes I know it's public and anyone can see it who wants to click on my username, but still, it stinks. Let Civcraft be Civcraft, leave out unrelated things."
Civcraft,3d8zvm,Lysika_Lantariel,-4,Tue Jul 14 14:14:30 2015 UTC,"It's unfortunate, but yes, I do believe the kindest and safest thing to do is to euthanize them.       Can you please define kind and safe? I'm pretty sure that death is unsafe for the recipient - at least by common standards of health and safety. As for kind - please argue this I just don't even know where to start. It sounds more like a HARD MAN making HARD DECISIONS. Not kindness.      all pedophiles will likely end up molesting a child at some point in their life       Why do you say this? I imagine plenty of straight civcrafters are going to live their lives without interacting with any girls. Cheap shot aside, you have to back this stuff up with evidence. It's a ridiculously strong thing to say and much of your argument hinges on it being true.       even ""non-practicing"" pedophiles who recognize the wrongness of their desires are vulnerable to giving into to their desires at certain times.       This immediately follows your previous comment where you state that all pedophiles will likely commit the molest. Then you say this which implies that some are merely vulnerable. Now you need to decide which of these you're going to stick to because they mean different things. I'll get back to you on this once you've made up your mind.       Pedophiles are too dangerous to be part of society       Again this hinges on your previous statement that it's likely all pedophiles will act on their urges. At least that's what I'm assuming - I'd have hoped you'd have written your own argument for me but I'm having to patch the holes here.       Secondly, I think it's inappropriate to go through a users Reddit history       Bleh it was too tempting. I also wanted to see people defend murdering innocents (inb4 thought crime). Be careful what you post on the internet. In ten years time it might be something far more important like an employer who finds it.      edit: If you can back up the strong statement you made I'd be much closer to agreeing with you (bar my distaste for the death penalty). Unfortunately without anything supporting it you have nothing."

A state historically dominated by a single ruler who has, for all practical purposes, alienated itself from its neighbors. The leader is seen to be paranoid, unstable, and highly manipulative. Any resemblance of trust at the international level has been systematically destroyed by their actions. This country has early violaged every treaty or agreement it has made, often through pettiness or incompetence. Meanwhile that leader enjoys relative popular support and near total control internally. Mainly because those that speak out are ruthlessly silenced. There have been at least 6 revolts/uprisings against this leader, that Im aware of, in this young nation's history. Two of which were put down by SPQR itself at the request of the local government leader. From their neighbor's perspective it is generally regarded as a shit hole and other leaders question what motivates it's citizenry to remain.  This is mostly due to near total ignorance, perpetually maintained by it's leadership's inability to effective interact with its neighbors, on how the state functions. Having burned all of its bridges with it's neighbors and past allies it has resorted to reaching further and further away to powers who have had little interaction with them on a regular basis to defend itself. It's current version of ""China"", as a larger and more stable protector, is the Gensokyians. Though historically the nations of Balkania, ISIS, Hjaltland, Mir, Senntisten, SPQR, and Volterra served as protectors of Kaiserin through the various clusterfucks incidents that have negatively impacted the CKR.

Nox evolved out of Libertas, which was a splinter faction of the WP in opposition to the rest. I hope I got that right. Eden is the World Police reformed. They're just as disrespectful of national sovereignty as before, made of the same people as before with a few extras like ProgrammerDan, and have claimed unilaterally the mantle of ""guardians of the server"". There is significant opposition to them though usually not armed. Edenites came into MA when Rogue spotted Papa_Pound hitting snitches in the MA Nether Factory. Papa had come to Mount Augusta to visit Sintralin (leader of Nox) in her home, and the Edenites swarmed, aiming to pearl him in violation of Augustan law. The Titan War was what started off the whole Libertas/WP (Nox/Eden) drama. There is a comprehensive-ish wiki article about it here. It's an expensive-as-hell factory that allows transport to and from the Nether. Nether portals are useful only for portal farms; to get into hell you need this factory, and only the largest towns have them thanks to the exclusion zones they have around them (much to the frustration of other towns).

The whole point of coming to MA was to commit a crime - killing Papa_Pound extralegally. Eden failed and probably can't be put on trial for it.

They have no idea our border has been there for two years. But because the ""official map"" from the first week of the sever shows a circle they just ignored our borders and walls.

Civcraft,3d99uf,JakeltheMan,10,Tue Jul 14 14:31:26 2015 UTC,"What did Eden do wrong?   Not having a prepared statement ready to be released explaining what was going on and allowing Sintralin to beat them to the punch. The general public only has one side of the story at the moment. I believe most players are waiting to hear the official version from Eden. I contacted Nightwinga, their PR guy, immediately and he had no idea this had been planned."
Civcraft,3d99uf,Roma_Victor,8,Tue Jul 14 15:01:20 2015 UTC,"This is essentially it.   Either way I left Eden this morning after some reading. I told them I'd leave as soon as they did something dumb, was hoping it wouldn't happen so fast.  To clarify though I don't think going after papa was wrong, when I wanted person shows themselves it's good to go after them. It shows the sad state of civcraft when the majority of the server seems to support someone like that.   But personally, I'm apathetic of papa and sort of lean towards him being left alone since he has one account pearled still. If I was online last night I would not have been in MTA and I also would not have sent supplies. Because I feel it was a waste of time, resources, and goodwill (which is now lost)."
Civcraft,3d99uf,dsclouse117,6,Tue Jul 14 15:18:35 2015 UTC,"It shows the sad state of civcraft when the majority of the server seems to support someone like that.   Not many people support Papa, they just don't support EDEN's attempt to apprehend him."
Civcraft,3d99uf,Eythx,6,Tue Jul 14 15:22:47 2015 UTC,"If you are talking about the attempt last night then I see your point and have to agree, I don't support it either. Going into a city where the majority are hostile to you seems like a bad choice, even if the goal wasn't really a bad one. It seems like a lot of poor choices were made last night."
Civcraft,3d99uf,dsclouse117,3,Tue Jul 14 15:31:39 2015 UTC,Once the Chanadians came we should have left since it escalated at that point.  Mistakes get made sometimes.

Not really a reason why half the server wants them gone.   What? I didn't address this at all and it is something you have brought from your own conclusions. I was solely speaking in regards to the event last night. I could make an educated guess at why they currently seem to be unpopular if you're interested. Why do you think they are?"
Civcraft,3d99uf,Roma_Victor,4,Tue Jul 14 18:27:19 2015 UTC,"Why do you think I was having a dig at you? A dig a week can satisfy my needs.

Nox has a better PR game, Nox are better at arguing (at least sintralin is) and furthermore people don't like the big bad governors to be in charge."
Civcraft,3d99uf,Morukil,2,Tue Jul 14 18:42:01 2015 UTC,"Why do you think I was having a dig at you?   I didnt and I'm not sure where you read into my previous statement that gave you that impression.   Why do I think they are unpopular? Nox has a better PR game, Nox are better at arguing (at least sintralin is) and furthermore people don't like the big bad governors to be in charge.   The Eden group was created to formalize the WP with rules and regulations and to help clean up its PR.  Most outside players were pleased to see them acting in a peaceful manner and abiding by the rules they placed upon themselves. It allowed players, and by extension towns, to feel comfortable with having them around. The rules they established made the Eden group a known factor as players were able to gauge what members would and would not do in given situations. It built up a sizeable amount of goodwill.   The events last night ran contrary to the rules they had established. They broken a number of them in their haste to capture Papa and worse did not have a PR rep standing by to ""clean up the mess"" immediately following. This allowed Nox's PR guys to seize the initiative and place their narrative out first and thereby casting Eden in a poor light publicly. That said, it speaks volumes on the respect much of the server has for players involved in Eden that many are willing to wait for their side of the story before passing judgement. The sooner Eden gets a comprehensive and accurate statement out there the better it will go. The longer they wait the more ""good will"" they will lose. Thankfully it sounds like one will be released soon-ish."

Civcraft,3d6m3m,Prof_TANSTAAFL,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:33:18 2015 UTC,Yeah within the time I've taken a break from civcraft I have found that the server isn't worth making a point or sub pvping on and just playing gantoe style or dicking around.  As long as you don't work for much or have anything to lose no one can dick with you too much and you don't have to worry about the game.  I was kinda going to make a quitting post I think but idk if people would even like it.  I wanted to say that the whole time I played this server I treated everyone nicely no matter what the gossip about them was until they acted bad to me themselves.  Also even though most people think the opposite I actually have never lied about anything except alts and harmless ruses and have generally been a trustworthy person.  Sad to see how the server has turned out.    The reason the experiment has not worked well is because there is no way for some scar of war so players think it is fun to pvp and bounty hunt.  The best way to play is to dick around and try to make friends along the way.  The only reason I have not left before I had to leave was because I didn't want the assholes of the server to win and laugh as I left.  I wanted to try to change it for the better somehow but it seems impossible unless people can't hide in their towns and cause massive circle jerks with their friends and others.
Civcraft,3d6m3m,Prof_TANSTAAFL,5,Mon Jul 20 22:24:43 2015 UTC,"Do you like lore and backstories in games you play? Civcraft has a ton of that, and most of it is stuff that has actually happened over the past 3+ years. Cross-server wars, invasions, internal strife within nations, the rise and fall of great cities, secret places in the middle of nowhere, epic battles, terrorist groups, groups who do nothing but collect and distribute books, amazing builds, etc. All of these have happened on the server because of actions that players have taken.

Civcraft,3d5kld,Antonius_Marcus,-1,Mon Jul 13 22:46:47 2015 UTC,"I have some issues with this theory:   When I asked Nova In mumble 3 days ago, who owned Vienna, I assumed it was MarkAFK, she said no, that the person had been gone for a long time. The Recording. (Sorry its so long, it would be somewhere in the first half, I think) Sure, maybe the idea slipped her mind... But really? Some snips of the conversation I had with Max here, in context seem to imply that Nova only removed Max after he began prodding at the notion of going independent, and Nova appears to have promised him the leadership position back if he didn't secede. I wouldn't put it past Nova to lie to Max in the situation, but why go through this? The /r/KaiserinReich_Vienna/ subreddit has been completely devoid of any and all activity, except that of Max. The Vienna Constitution lists Maxhumphreys as the Governor Convenient Screenshot is convenient... Are you telling me there is no subreddit mention of the governor of Kaiserin's second largest city being replaced?   I'm not sure Kaiserin is really in a position, given the recent abdication of its monarch and resignation of its Chancellor to be asserting any sort of sovereignty based off of a technical claim brought about through the legal reading of a constitution governing a state that is teetering on failure and oblivion."
Civcraft,3d5kld,Antonius_Marcus,2,Mon Jul 13 22:00:51 2015 UTC,"I won't address this yet, can you please find the specific part in that recording that you're using as evidence? This is false. I have already shown above that Max recognized that the Vienna government changed in his absence. This supports the fact that Max was away from Civcraft for months and had lost control of Vienna long before any of his attempts at secession. Vienna has been using the official Kaiserinreich subreddit. That Constitution is no longer in effect, it has been superseded by this Constitution that was approved by the residents of the CKR, including Icenia. There was no need to announce to the entire subreddit what was, at the time, a relatively minor transfer of power. If I had known that Vienna would be at the center of a major controversy a few weeks afterwards, I or Nova would have certainly made an official post about it.   There is no technicality about this situation. Max has not been in control of Vienna for months."

Because you tried to give away a territory you hadn't been in for 8 months.   The Kaiserinreich as a whole, and especially NovaCeasar has become increasingly hostile towards the region and even its own people, importing foreign fighters to occupy their own territory.   They're not foreign fighters, they're members of the new confederacy, which I assume you missed.   NovaCeaser has become a Tyrant and I have lost faith in the CKR as a whole.

The Kaiserinreich as a whole, and especially NovaCeasar has become increasingly hostile towards the region and even its own people, importing foreign fighters to occupy their own territory.   Your inactivity is showing. All forces responding to Nova's requests for aid have been from within the UCKG - the confederation that Kaiserinreich joined and leads alongside Gensokyo. These forces responded to prevent Rome from annexing the region with the pretense of Minerva's land claims.   NovaCeaser has become a Tyrant and I have lost faith in the CKR as a whole.

Civcraft,3d2hrk,smaldragon,7,Mon Jul 13 09:07:48 2015 UTC,"My knowledge of things:  Kaiserinreich, after a long series of drama with its neighbors, was given by Rome the choice to join SPQR or leave the region (remembering this from my speaking with Herbie after the Deseret crap). Kaiserin is thus annexed. Nova is given a position of trust in Rome for some reason, which I've never heard adequately explained if her nation was annexed and the drama was apparently about broken treaties and lack of trust.  Eventually, Kaiserin declares its independence from Rome for the reasons given here. This is about when I became personally involved. Rome then attacks Kaiserinreich, pearling a few government officials before being forced out, and a ceasefire is signed. Before that, Nova releases modmail from the Roman government sub (which she had access to, astonishingly) which revealed they had expansionistic designs on the lands of some of their allies. Public opinions is decidedly opposed to Rome at this point.  What follows is then an endless period of negotiations where multiple candidate treaties are almost accepted by both parties but then get thrown out (from what I've heard) until finally Rome says ""fuck it"" and gives a unilateral declaration of what they recognize as Kaiserin's land claims and recognize their independence.  Kaiserinreich had kept secret throughout these negotiations a small ""desert colony"" called Deseret, which had existed for many months as an underground patch of netherwart. In an effort to get claim on the land in negotiations, they begin building houses topside as well as a cactus farm. I see it at the end of my tour of the Kaiserinreich. Unfortunately, they had not realized Rome had already concluded negotiations with its proclamation.  Rome sees the colony and we get a brief war out of things. A Roman senator is pearled and brought to the Kaiserin vault in preparation for transfer to Mir, Volterra jumps in on the Roman side (Nova was unpleasantly surprised by that, from our chatter in mumble I learned she thought she had resolved tensions with them) and occupies Kaiserin City. I get in touch with Herbie and frantically try to help by organizing a ceasefire, which collapses in an hour-long break I had. I call in ProgrammerDan to moderate a discussion between Nova and Herbie and a peaceful resolution is reached, without any shouting - Nova is capable of rational interaction with Romans, or at least with one Roman leader.  ChrisChrispie is given control over Icenia, as Nova wants to see if his bad reputation with running cities is blown out of proportion or is actually true before she lets him have more power in the Reich. Icenia gets a population boom under Chris, then promptly secedes and joins the GNA (something about free trade?). The Icenian secession is recognized as Kaiserinreich actually has (had) a legal mechanism for cities to leave if they wanted to, and an alliance is signed.  Chris immediately says that the alliance isn't actually an alliance. He then proceeds to ban United Commonwealth (ie, Gensokyojin and Kaiserin) troop movements to Vienna, which Rome had been trying to get to secede, as well as laying claim to it because the former owner of the area came back after 8 months and deeded the area over to Rome. Chris seems to do this primarily because Screen offended him on 8chan by playing up the fact he's buddies with Rome in an attempt to gain Channer volunteers to defend Vienna from the anticipated Roman attack.  We get into mumble with nightwinga and Ladezkik. Night serves as an intermediary to talk to Rome on the situation. A treaty is signed, ceding part of the land Rome wanted, and getting a bilateral agreement on what Kaiserinreich's borders actually are. Fernum from Brynley comes on and is very confused that Rome was claiming land in Brynley's name that they didn't even want.  Rail drama happens, frankly I'm confused about it. Something about cutting off Kaiserin's access to Orion? Not sure. Nova fucks up by altering the treaty with Icenia unilaterally. She recognizes this and abdicates today to MRL so she can take a break and build stuff in southern Kaiserinreich."

Civcraft,3d2hrk,smaldragon,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:00:46 2015 UTC,"A couple clarifications:    The independence movement was not just caused by a single factor like free trade, it was a combination of a lot of stuff like Icenians wanting the ckr to focus on the city while nova wanted to settle multiple places at the same time, Nova not really trusting or liking Icenians (seeing some of them as ""Volterran spies"") and vice-versa, the border being closed which annoyed Icenia because no new people could join the city and the overall bad reputation of the ckr which was hurting Icenia by making all our comments and posts about the city be targeted by downvote brigades.  We saw a lot of downsides to being in the ckr and no real benefit from staying. The decision to close the rails was done by me and droid after we saw that post on 8chan, chris was actually offline at the time and had no influence in our decision or knowledge about the post. Basically Icenia is currently under a temporary council composed by me, droid and chris and every one of us has equal power and representation, even if chris is the founder and the one who usually represents us on mumble and things. Rail drama: Kaiserin has a central station in the rough center of the country connected to Harvest and all the cities in the ckr, originally this station was the only way to get to Icenia which forced you to travel a long distance to get to the city from orion, so because Icenia was the largest and most active city in the ckr we decided it was best to divert the rail so it went first to Icenia and then to the central station so we could cut travel time to Orion by nearly half. Then when we gained independence nova decided she wanted to have the rail line back to its original status while Icenia decided it wanted to have a direct connection to Orion that didn't pass through Harvest. So because of this we signed the treaty stating that the rail line would come back to its original Harvest-Central form once Icenia completed its Orion-Icenia line, however nova didn't respect this and changed the line without informing us, thus breaking the treaty (and she later attempted to edit it to hide her violation of the treaty)."
Civcraft,3d2hrk,Roma_Victor,2,Mon Jul 13 11:41:52 2015 UTC,"Nova not really trusting or liking Icenians (seeing some of them as ""Volterran spies"")    The only one I heard her call that was Noobtube. The rest of you she never had any problems with (speaking from what she told me in mumble).  And if it was you and Droid who blocked our troops - why? With Chris I can understand from the reason he gave (even if it was petty and/or a misunderstanding) but neither of you were mentioned in the post, and Icenia wasn't either."
Civcraft,3d2hrk,smaldragon,8,Mon Jul 13 18:09:45 2015 UTC,"From the Icenia end basically it was a city founded 3 months ago that I was given governor of. It blew up in size and many of the citizens disliked nova so we had a referendum and left the union.  It's now ran by me, smal, and droid. As for the recent drama nova broke an agreement dealing with our current shared rail to Orion and changed a treaty without us knowing."

Nova enters into treaty with Mir, Mir doesn't realize that the treaty is one sided because they have no experience dealing with Nova. Nova steals a bunch of shit from Volterra, claims that she didn't steal anything. Nova gets called out on her bullshit, but still unclear if she actually did steal anything. Not sure about this, but Mir/Kaiserin were angry and trying to use the excuse ""she's a head of state, you can't pearl her because of diplomatic immunity"",neglecting that diplomatic immunity is a provision of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, not CivCraft precendent.

Civcraft,3d0f6i,Electric_Rat,3,Sun Jul 12 20:41:14 2015 UTC,"Just so you can hear the other side of the story;  Altbot arrived in my town claiming to be new to the server in full diamond armor. He asked for an apartment and immediately placed a snitch in his bedroom, reinforced it with diamond in front of me. New friends don't know to do this, nor do they have diamond armor or diamonds for reinforcement. I asked him how long he had been on the server, to which he replied 2 hours. I asked him where he had gotten the armor and he claimed 'I killed a jew for it' thinking I would believe him or perhaps find it funny. It was at this point that I asked him to leave.  He asked why, I told him it was because I didn't trust or believe him. After refusing to leave I pearled him, released him by kolima and told him not to return. He showed up less than an hour later so i pearled him again. I released him just outside of viridian this time, once again returning all the stuff he had on him.  A week or 2 after this he tried to have me assassinated for simply enforcing order in my own land.  He collaborated with folters secret alt; sadisticmoose, building a hollow vault on arran's claim during brinton's absence and attempted to lure chanadians there several times, trespassing and then running back to the vault and placing bounties on chanadians for pursuing them.  According to folters he also illegally snitched our land on at least one occasion.  After finally having enough of this nonsense, I asked the brinton - the true owner of the claim for permission to check out the vault and place a snitch- which he granted me.   Shortly after we arrived, rekvia mysteriously appeared!    Mere seconds after shouting 'get out' she started shooting arrows at us.  This proved to be pretty fucking retarded as there were 8 of us and only one of her.  She was pearled in about 30 seconds.   At this time we suspected that altbot was rekvia. however since DKjesusman had pearled rekvia earlier that evening for foolishly freeing hantzu on accident.  We were quite surprised to see 'altbot has logged in' on skynet a minute or 2 after leaving the vault, as we expected that account to be altbanned.  Malen and xavter came into our mumble, got our side of the story and concocted a scheme to exchange rekvia's pearl with altbots.  They arrived at his illegal vault, retrieved rekvia's armor and gear, which we left there, pearled him, and headed to chanada to make the exchange.  We do not want reps for him snitching our roads, tresspassing, or for placing a 'hit' on me.  We have only wanted the identity of his main account.  Since he continued to stir trouble on the subreddit, whining and pleading for support for weeks (literally weeks) - to no avail - we offered him an ultimatum.  Tell us your main within 48 hours or permapearl.  He chose permapearl.  Everything I have said here is 100% true.  With the exception of the first paragraph every single item is backed up with mumble recordings, MC logs or screenshots and has already been posted on the sub.  I have faith that brinton, Malen and xavter if asked would agree I was truthful about their limited interactions to this drama.  TLDR: he committed several crimes - mostly minor, fucked with us and continues to slander our name.  All we wanted was to know who altbot was - we gave him one final chance to free himself and he squandered it."

Civcraft,3d0f6i,polexports,2,Mon Jul 13 08:36:23 2015 UTC,"Assassinated would imply that it was political, which it wasn't. You were killed multiply times because you were claiming to be a ""newfriend"" with full diamond armor walking into a territory a number of times (Trespassing). I wasn't there when a chest was popped, but I do know when I got there it was to get rid of the bastion-  and the chest was filled with cobble/dirt.  You've also claimed that you're an alt, there is no way anyone who is sane would put an alt on trial. That's why we've been budging you to reveal your identity. If you had of revealed your main, trial would be necessary, you denied that opportunity yourself   It's too late now anyway, you're going to have to play with the burden that if you get pearled on your main, you will be alt banned."

However, instead of blessing them them as heroes as the ""Malen Militia"" expected, the international Civcraft community, not used to the memey rites and customs of 2015 Civcraft PvPers enter into further and further conflict with the Malen Militia as they struggle with their own old factions blood pulsing once again through their veins.
