skyrim,3e3cd2,alabged,6,Tue Jul 21 17:15:45 2015 UTC,I feel like this would be some crazy mod. Amazing idea because the guards could be telling you about your other character. Like you'll be playing on your adventurer/dragon born character and a guard will mention the thieves guild being back in business that you did on your sneak character. It would probably take a while to make but it would probably be well worth it. I always liked making new characters but didn't like feeling like I have to do all the quest lines on every one.

Done chopping wood, cast transmute again. Repeat until I'm out of iron/silver.  Then I craft jewelry and use the gold from wood chopping to buy leather and make that. Even better if there's somewhere with lots of animals around.  Time consuming, but pretty relaxing to do if you're watching a show or reading or something.   You also might try improving items- that gives a pretty good boost for a low cost"

I started by going around selling all the useless weapons I gathered up and stored various places. Buy all the arrows to boost the gold then all the ingots, leather and leather strips. Make whatever I could with my available perks and sold what I made back to the blacksmith. Then make my way to another town and do the same thing at that blacksmith. Whiterun was a great stop because there are two blacksmiths in the city. The only sucky part was the overburdened walk everywhere. Don't forget to put on some haggle enchanted items to wear while you are doing the buying and selling. I would wear a thieves guild hood, a necklace, a ring, and Cicero's clothes(poor Cicero)."

And you have the lover stone in the aetherial crown, which you remove, sleep for well rested, then replace, right? Because if you do all those things, you're getting a 70 (* edit: math) 60 percent bonus.  Other than that, I gotta say dwarven bows. What's not to like about it?   Clear dwemer ruin Take as many trips as you need to take home all the dwemer metal to Whiterun Buy all of Eorland and Adrianne's iron ore and ingots Sleep to gain well rested, then place aetherial crown on head for ancient knowledge, warrior stone, lovers comfort, and well rested Smith dwarven bows. If you run out of iron ingots, improve the ones you've made. * edit- apparently improving items is more efficient than making them in the first place, so maybe prioritize that.    It may not be the most efficient in terms of materials, but it's incredibly easy to get dwemer metal and iron ingots at any level. Go to the dwarven storeroom near mzulft and the dwemer museum in markarth and you could probably get those 20 levels and then some."
skyrim,3e1urt,HotPocketPanda,2,Tue Jul 21 12:10:37 2015 UTC,"I use 2 methods.  One, go hunting for bandit chiefs.  If you have the DLCs bandit chiefs after - I think- level 30 start having Nordic Carved Armor.  That armor for some reason, improves much more than any other armor.  You will almost jump an entire level for eat one you upgrade - just the armor, not even the helmet, boots and gloves.  Every damn bandit chief seems to have a set after a certain point, so they are not hard to come by.     The other method is to enchant pieces of armor, and then upgrade them.  Leveling is based on the cost of the item.   One you enchant a pair of boots with sneak or carry weight, their cost goes up quite a bit.  So now, when you improve the armor on top of that, the game treats it like a much higher grade armor and levels you faster.  Nordic carved is best for enchanting too.   The best armor enchantment for levelling is fortify destruction, by the way."

skyrim,3e1urt,minewindd,2,Tue Jul 21 11:09:50 2015 UTC,"If you have dawnguard, I think the most efficient way would be to go to a dwemer ruin, collect all the scrap metal, smelt it into ingots, chop some firewood and make a ton of dwarven arrows. I believe this way you get some base xp for every arrow crafted(and you craft 20 arrows from 1 ingot), it's like mass-crafting iron daggers, only better."
skyrim,3e1urt,firemogle,2,Tue Jul 21 15:39:14 2015 UTC,"Iron daggers used to be the best way, until at some point they updated it so the experience you gain is scaled to the value of the item.   On my most recent character I would go into dwarven ruins and collect all the dwarven items I could find that would melt down into dwarven ingots. I used the Internet to find out which items would yield the most ingots for the least weight and had my follower carry all of the ones I couldn't. Then I'd just return to Whiterun and smelt as many dwarven bows as I could. If you want, you can enchant them to make them worth quite a bit of gold and not need to worry about gold anymore"

skyrim,3e1urt,illeaglealien,2,Tue Jul 21 11:34:41 2015 UTC,"The gold and silver jewellry method works better if you put gems on them. You probably know that the amount of experience you get depends on the item value.  I usually proceed like that: craft all jewellry  (with gems) I can, then I make bows (dwarven bow for heavy path and elven for light path), leaving ingredients to improve them in the griding stone. If you have Fortify Smithing gear and potions, improving the bows give you more xp than producing them.  Oh, and don't forget to activate the Warrior Stone and sleep in your bed to get the bonuses. And if you really want to push it up, try to get the Ancient Knowledge (This quest is particularly useful beacuse it's placed on a Dwarven Ruin. Collect all scrap metal you can carry, then smelt 'em into ingots).  Happy smithing!"
skyrim,3e1urt,Electric_unicorn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:35:04 2015 UTC,The quickest was is to use the alchemy exploit to make crazy smiting potions and upgrade something.   The fastest legit way is probably jewelry.

In fallout you pretty much had a speech check for every quest, to get more money or something.  Skyrim's speech is imo only useful for the bartering. The 'fence' perk is really good if you're a thief. But still, getting speech to level 90 isn't that easy iirc."

skyrim,3e1yyo,Delvez,2,Tue Jul 21 16:20:00 2015 UTC,"I've never felt hindered by a low speech skill or never putting perks into it. Speech mostly affects barter prices and eventually allows you to sell any item to any merchant and sell stolen items to vendors you've invested in. If you're a thief or just do a lot of buying/selling and aren't using all your perk points for other skills, go ahead and dump some in Speech.  It's nothing like Fallout, though."

skyrim,3e298f,Shrykos,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:58:57 2015 UTC,"As /u/Juan-San said, when you disenchant an object, you learn the enchantment on the object, not the specific magnitude of the enchantment. If you happen to find a Fortify Magicka +1 ring and disenchant it, you will learn the Fortify Magicka enchantment.  The magnitude of an enchantment you place on an item depends not on the material or value of the item but on your enchanting skill level, perks in the enchanting tree, and the size of the soul in the soul gem you use. Grand or Black souls will provide the most power.  Certain enchantments can only be placed on certain pieces of equipment, which you will see when you attempt to enchant them, as unavailable options will be greyed out. Muffle and Waterbreathing have no magnitude, which means you don't need to spend a large soul on them and they will work exactly the same with a Petty soul."

skyrim,3dyo1n,mofothehobo,4,Tue Jul 21 14:08:26 2015 UTC,I'm worried that this is all there is to it. Landscape. Without proper storylines and NPC
skyrim,3dyo1n,thecrackedcreeper,13,Mon Jul 20 20:27:14 2015 UTC,"At the moment, yes. However, they've imported quite a number of the quests to Skyrim already, so the main thing is to recreate the NPCs and pathing logic for them."
skyrim,3dyo1n,fishfiend6656,19,Mon Jul 20 20:30:10 2015 UTC,"NPCs are all done, we just need navmeshing."
skyrim,3dyo1n,countmontecristo,3,Mon Jul 20 20:31:34 2015 UTC,Where would one sign up to help out with navmeshing?
skyrim,3dyo1n,Sophilosophical,5,Tue Jul 21 10:52:35 2015 UTC,Any news on when I will be allowed to play this?
skyrim,3dyo1n,countmontecristo,7,Mon Jul 20 21:32:42 2015 UTC,"Filthy console peasant, you'll never be able to play this. Sincerely,  A fellow filthy console peasant. P.S. I'm hear if you need a fellow shoulder to cry upon."
skyrim,3dyo1n,Eclapse,3,Tue Jul 21 00:28:54 2015 UTC,"Sorry, forgot to update my flair :/ though my computer isn't really anything to brag about."
skyrim,3dyo1n,thecrackedcreeper,0,Tue Jul 21 03:23:32 2015 UTC,"Someone isn't a peasant because they don't play on PC, they're a console peasant if they try to say that consoles are better than pc for absurd reasons.   A PC user can be a peasant if they spout that ""Your computer isn't even that good"" bullshit.   As the sidebar says on the pcmr sub -  Everyone is ""PC Master race"" as long as they recognize that it's the most limitless platform.   Or something like that, I don't remember verbatim."
skyrim,3dyo1n,Freezer_SIave,2,Tue Jul 21 14:08:05 2015 UTC,We're hoping to get a public release out soon. Maybe this month or the next as far as I can tell.
skyrim,3dyo1n,SystemMalfunction,2,Tue Jul 21 02:24:11 2015 UTC,Is this supposed to be current Cyrodiil or 200 years old Cyrodiil?
skyrim,3dyo1n,Capt_Reynolds,5,Mon Jul 20 21:00:48 2015 UTC,"Since it's supposed to be a remake of Oblivion, I'm assuming it'll be as it was then, ie 200 years before the events of Skyrim."
skyrim,3dyo1n,SystemMalfunction,2,Mon Jul 20 22:18:31 2015 UTC,It would be nice if they had a rebuilt Kvatch though.
skyrim,3dyo1n,spectrosoldier,2,Tue Jul 21 01:44:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that would be a nice thing to add into the game since they're essentially remaking it anyway, and mods might take some time to be converted, if they ever are."
skyrim,3dyo1n,b0nd4g3,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:48:31 2015 UTC,Could someone mod the game when it comes out? Because that might become an option.
skyrim,3dyo1n,Stream867,4,Tue Jul 21 11:25:59 2015 UTC,Do you reckon it can be run on my shitty toaster? My loins ache for this mod
skyrim,3dyo1n,sirsilo,3,Mon Jul 20 19:51:52 2015 UTC,Why hasn't anyone answered this real fucking question? Will it still play if I'm also toasting my bread?!

Really looks like oblivion. The dungeons are also greatly improved over the original; more colors in them. I always hated dungeoning in oblivion because everything looked grey or bluish white.  Haha, while watching the video I kept looking to the bottom left for the compass. Oblivion habits."

skyrim,3dyo1n,Reerrzhaz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:32:12 2015 UTC,You do realize they might get a gaming PC before Skyblivion is finished and ready to be played?
skyrim,3dyo1n,SachmoJoe,-3,Tue Jul 21 12:50:26 2015 UTC,"HEAVY BREATHING  On a side note, according to Dexion (the old dude who read the elder scrolls for you) the Imperial city is in ruins along with the white-gold tower. Immersion pls  Make it look like there was a Great War, not like it was last era. Thank you :)"
skyrim,3dyo1n,Reerrzhaz,7,Tue Jul 21 02:38:38 2015 UTC,"I think you're missing the point - it is the last era. It's a port of Oblivion to the Skyrim engine, not a mod that lets you run around in in what Cyrodiil would be like during/after the Skyrim events."
skyrim,3dyo1n,arrowtothethrowaway,2,Tue Jul 21 02:42:48 2015 UTC,Yeah but half of us already have oblivion for that. I feel like if they at least added some realism of the era in it would be thegreatestever.jpg  Yes I get the point. I just wish they connected the two instead of remaking oblivion with a new engine.

skyrim,3e190y,medsteele,14,Tue Jul 21 04:37:09 2015 UTC,"Without exploits, the typical unarmed build is as follows:  --Khajiit (22 base unarmed damage)  --Heavy Armor perk ""Fists of Steel""  --Fortify Unarmed enchantment on some gloves and a ring (or necklace, can't remember which)  --Alchemy/Enchanting loop to create the most powerful ""fortify enchanting"" potion possible  --Daedric Gauntlets  The ""Fists of Steel"" perk only adds the BASE defense value from your gauntlets, which is why you need a pair of Daedric to maximize your attack power. It will not add any extra damage due to your Heavy Armor skill, perks, or smithing improvements raising your armor rating on your gauntlets."
skyrim,3e190y,medsteele,4,Tue Jul 21 04:59:34 2015 UTC,okay got anything for with exploits too? lol
skyrim,3e190y,G-Viral,5,Tue Jul 21 05:07:45 2015 UTC,"The easiest would be using the restoration-loop exploit (easily googled for detailed instructions) and crafting yourself a piece of Fortify Unarmed apparel with an insane boost, thus giving you punches worth anything from 100 to 1,000,000 (and beyond) damage."
skyrim,3e190y,Lord_Fate,3,Tue Jul 21 06:00:14 2015 UTC,"I tried doing this. and I followed all the steps correctly (I'm pretty sure) and yet my fortify restoration potions would max out at 42%. when I tried to keep going, it would drop down to 41%. and so when I tried again it would go back up to 42% but then continue alternating between these two numbers. I have a hide helmet, hide bracers, a gold ring, and a gold necklace ALL with fortify alchemy 23%.  these are the steps I do:  I have the 4 armour pieces that fortify alchemy equipped  I create a fortify rest potion  I drink the potion  I un-equip and re-equip all my armour  I make another potion... and repeat etc.  am I doing anything wrong? is this patched and I didn't know? I'm on PS3 if that matters."
skyrim,3e190y,FrayedApron,5,Tue Jul 21 09:01:27 2015 UTC,"The way the loop works is you fortify your Alchemy with magical equipment. Then, you use your fortified Alchemy to create a potion of fortify Enchanting. Then, you use your fortified Enchanting to create new magical equipment+ to fortify your Alchemy. Then use your fortified Alchemy + to create a potion of fortify Enchanting+. Then use your fortified Enchanting to create new magical equipment++ to fortify your Alchemy.  Rinse and repeat 'til broken."

skyrim,3e190y,dlgn13,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:34:08 2015 UTC,Don't know the number of potions... But I would recommend at least 40 of each ingredient. Quite possibly even more. (did this one myself on console)
skyrim,3e190y,Nerdtendo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:46:52 2015 UTC,shit. 40 is a-fucking-lot. but worth it for the build I suppose haha. I just want to be able to one shit everything with my fists.

Just search for that term on Nexus and you'll find some.  Also, there are mods that allow you to put any enchantment on any item piece, so you're not restricted to adding your unarmed bonus to just a couple pieces."
