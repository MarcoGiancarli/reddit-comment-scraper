I live in Asia so I'm a lot taller than everyone else in the elevator which makes it even more amusing.  Another good one is invading personal space by sitting at a 2 person table with a stranger or standing uncomfortably close to someone while waiting in line.  The funny thing is, when someone invades my space by sitting in a socially uncomfortable way, in my brain I'm like, ""why is this person sitting here with all of the other available options."" I need more practice I guess."

Now, the creepy part is when a parent goes up with their child, and the parent is whispering to this little 3+ year old kid and telling him what to recite. If that's not brainwashing, idk what is. Here is an example.  The temple is weird as shit. You can see for yourself here. You can see the whole version here. I have no idea how anyone can go through this and say ""It's not a cult.""   I would do more, but I am running a bit short on time. You can always go to /r/exmormon and ask there if you are interested. They are all always willing and happy to reveal anything weird about the church."
IDareYou,3d1sw1,ThatGermanFella,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:00:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks for that, man. It's always struck me as odd that they're so secretive about the inner-workings of the religion. Although, I guess that might also be the case for other major religions, I have no idea. I'm curious, how long were you a part of the church? Is it very difficult to leave?"
IDareYou,3d1sw1,Not_Pablo_Sanchez,2,Mon Jul 13 19:38:27 2015 UTC,"I was born into it. I started questioning it when I was 17. I knew it was bull shit when I turned 20. How hard it is to leave depends on where you're from and how you define ""leave"". People in Utah have a lot harder time leaving. I'm from California, so it wasn't ingrained in every part of my social life. Some people define leave as getting your membership records removed. Others, like myself, define leaving as just not going back. So leaving for me was not difficult at all. As far as family goes, I remained an in-the-closet exmormon until I was independent."

I will do it if these questions are answered. And if my parents allow me. Maybe we could do some charity thing? I'm 15, got plenty of time (finished exams). We could set something up on Twitch or something.  One last thing about proof; I have a webcam but I removed the infra-red lens so I can use it as a cheap mans oculus rift.

Twitch would work if we go that rout."
IDareYou,3c1ym5,Fruit_Cake_Best_Cake,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:34:46 2015 UTC,Hallucinations and micro sleeps sounds dangerous. I mean I have to do sixth form next year and I'm dumb enough as it is.

IDareYou,3bz2in,Kushkaki,3,Fri Jul 3 13:13:45 2015 UTC,honestly the hardest part is being able to remember the lyrics. the is actually not as fast as it sounds. Eminem just uses very short words and a fast beat to make it seem superhuman
IDareYou,3bz2in,toms_face,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:25:52 2015 UTC,"Really though if you count the words per second or even syllables per second, you're going to find it much faster than most songs.  There's pretty much a genre for it.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patter_song"
IDareYou,3bz2in,autowikibot,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:48:39 2015 UTC,"Patter song:       The patter song is characterised by a moderately fast to very fast tempo with a rapid succession of rhythmic patterns in which each syllable of text corresponds to one note.  It is a staple of comic opera, especially Gilbert and Sullivan, but it has also been used in musicals and elsewhere.   The lyric of a patter song generally features tongue-twisting rhyming text, with alliterative words and other consonant or vowel sounds that are intended to be entertaining to listen to at rapid speed.  The musical accompaniment is lightly orchestrated and fairly simple, to emphasise the text.  The song is often intended as a showpiece for a comic character, usually a bass or baritone.  The singer should be capable of excellent enunciation in order to show the song to maximum effect.

IDareYou,3bz2in,toms_face,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:49:24 2015 UTC,its faster than most songs but its not one of the fastest rap song out there. Its not even eminems fastest song if your going by syllables per second.

IDareYou,3bmu8e,Ron1212,2,Wed Jul 1 04:35:57 2015 UTC,It wasn't even that cool visually or CGI and such compared to the other marvel films.   It looked almost like child's play comparatively.   A friend of mine who is just generally very into marvel and DC comics and movies/tv shows and.. Just generally movies and tv shows (he doesn't do much else) fucking loves guardians of the Galaxy.   He torrented it and made me watch it one night and it was honestly underwhelming. Dont see the fuss. Just because what's his name was in it?   He loves him from parks and rec.

Homophobic speech is the easiest way to get down voted, but thats a touchy subject, so all my shit might get down voted.  If I go on an anti gun sub or anti police sub and give an edgy speech, I think I can reach 50, but not 100"

IDareYou,3bmu8e,sweetjingle,12,Wed Jul 1 01:49:29 2015 UTC,"Challenge accepted. I intend to earn every downvote.    Before you click that arrow, /r/IDareYou, let me tell you a little bit about myself.    I am a member of the National Socialist party, a registered Republican, and a proud member of the NRA.  I killed Kenny- twice.  I once called my sweet grandmother a bitch- at her husband's funeral. I post ""Shovel Dog"" on /r/aww, with varying thumbnail images and titles, at least four times a week, on various throwaway accounts. I don't know who I hate more- black people, Jews, or Bernie Sanders. Once a week, I volunteer at my local soup kitchen. During my shift, I sit in the pantry and eat the rations designated for the homeless. I make $200,000 a year. I am a /r/FatPeopleHate subscriber. I am Buddy Fletcher. I am /u/GallowBoob. I regularly embezzle money from the Make-A-Wish Foundation. In fact, I once mugged a MAWF worker dressed as Batman while he was escorting a child around town. I'm a white heterosexual male. My front lawn features the following objects prominently: A Confederate flag, flying at full mast; a burning cross; a '76 Ford pickup truck (no wheels); and a tire fire. I regularly buy tires in order to keep the fire constantly burning. Global warming is a myth, after all! LoZ: Ocarina of Time is a shitty game. In fact, there's not a good game in the series. Nor are any of the Pokemon or Mario games decent by any definition of the word. My bookshelf features such classics as ""Mein Kampf"" and ""The Bible,"" which is my favorite work of fiction by far. I have it on good authority that your mother is a hamster, and your father smelt of elderberries. Furthermore, I have photographic evidence of this, and I masturbate to it daily. Go ahead and think about that one. Did I mention I once carried a semiautomatic weapon into a movie theater full of children just because I had a gun license?     Well, there you go, Reddit. If that's not worth your downvotes, then either I didn't try hard enough, or you are all some seriously fucked-up people.  EDIT: This comment has POSITIVE karma?!?!? What the actual fuck? This might be harder than I thought."

There was a tennis ball stuck in one of the squares at the top, I was drunk and with a friend, and he dared me to go get it. Which I did.  It was an orange and yellow squishy tennis ball, I had kept it as a souvenir but I think I threw it when I moved... :("

I assume you mean free-soloing, which uses no protection other than your hands, feet, and skill level.  However, bouldering could technically be a form of free-soling.  Which is also done all the time - usually maxing out at about 20 feet."

IDareYou,3bhyuq,strangely-wise,5,Mon Jun 29 11:12:51 2015 UTC,"So I was at a party with some friends I hadn't seen in a while. While we were at the party we had some drinks and were bored so we decided to do a childish dare contest. I'll keep this story short and let's just say it was now my turn... My friends as I said hadn't seen me in a while, so they didn't know that my girlfriend was coming to the party late, let alone that I had a girlfriend... So they end up seeing a girl walk in to the living room looking around, for what I assume was me... My friends then look at me since it's my turn and see my eyes fixed on her, her back is now turned to us. So they get the childish idea that they will dare me to walk up to her and smack her hard on her ass. Now being the respectful guy of the group, and them all knowing that, they were expecting me to turn it down... But to their surprise, I said ""alright"". They all were shocked by my answer, and thought I was bluffing. So I said ""watch this boys..."" and I proceeded to my girlfriend (her back still to us). I looked behind my shoulder and saw them shaking their heads, still thinking that I wasn't going to do it. So I drew my hand back and smacked her across her ass. I smiled and looked back at the guys, their jaws WIDE open in disbelief... I then turned my head back to my girlfriend, who was turning around to see who just smacked her ass. She then vigorously slapped my face, my friends burst out laughing... But then upon looking at who she slapped, hugged me (saying she was sorry) and then kissed me, then my friends' jaws dropped again.    The reason why this dare is memorable to me, is my friends faces and reactions to me going through with it. I wish I had pictures..."

IDareYou,3bgty0,Twoshoefoo,3,Mon Jun 29 19:46:57 2015 UTC,Here's one I used when I was younger:  -3 sets of 20 push-ups  -2 sets of 5 or 10 pull-ups  -2 sets of 10 sit-ups (increase # of sets by 1 every week)  -Run / jog a mile a day (start with walking if you're really out of shape)

I also have some very poorly taken before pictures, so I'll take some better ones tomorrow and compare and then possibly post them here if I'm not feeling super self conscious.  In a month, hopefully those numbers improve. I'm pretty sure I can complete all of those in a much faster overall time, but I wasn't really trying for speed, I just happened to keep track of the time. I don't have any kind of routine yet, but it will likely involve a lot of running, push ups, pull ups, and planks."
