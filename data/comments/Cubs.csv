Cubs,3e425e,CubsBot,2,Tue Jul 21 20:10:23 2015 UTC,Getting frustrated with this bullpen. God damn.   Edit: SCHWARMACHINE  Edit 2: MOTHER FUCKING SCHWARMACHINE!!!
Cubs,3e2hzl,jsiemian,6,Tue Jul 21 13:27:55 2015 UTC,Theo is building a monster and I'm fucking STOKED!
Cubs,3e2hzl,Boom_Baby31,4,Tue Jul 21 14:29:32 2015 UTC,I'd like to have Price now but I think we'd have to give up way too much.
Cubs,3e2hzl,Boom_Baby31,4,Tue Jul 21 14:32:19 2015 UTC,"Then you don't pull the trigger and wait till the offseason to sign him. I think we have enough prospects to get rid of 1 or 2 for Price, as long as it's not someone super valuable like Schwarber."
Cubs,3e2hzl,AlmostStainless,4,Tue Jul 21 14:58:25 2015 UTC,I'd give up Baez and that's probably it right now. Maybe Castro as well.
Cubs,3e2hzl,dorkimoe,2,Tue Jul 21 15:41:40 2015 UTC,"Kinsler at 2B, Jose Iglesias at SS. No way the Tigers are moving Price for those pieces. If the rumors about Cespedes are true then (cue scary music) Soler makes sense."
Cubs,3e2hzl,Battle_Sheep,2,Tue Jul 21 16:39:21 2015 UTC,"I am now ok with trading either of those, but not for someone who is a free agent next year. Its not worth it."
Cubs,3e2hzl,trippin113,6,Tue Jul 21 22:59:45 2015 UTC,"Oh man, this is tough, given how difficult it has been to watch the Cubs the last few years it's hard not to say fuck it and go all in on '15. That said, I think the division is  a reach, and I'm not too keen on mortgaging some of our best prospects for a one game play in. Especially since our offense is so young and inconsistent. We've gotten this far being absolutely patient, what's another half season, let him get traded and sign him as a FA  and keep our draft pick in the offseason."
Cubs,3e2hzl,captainbuttercream,5,Tue Jul 21 14:43:19 2015 UTC,Any copy pasta of the text? There is a paywall.
Cubs,3e2hzl,marpat1,11,Tue Jul 21 13:35:45 2015 UTC,"David Price is about to be put on the trade market officially, and those sounds you’re hearing are air raid sirens on both sides of town.  The Tigers have a better record than the White Sox, but they seem to know they’re done. Not sure what’s taking the Sox so long, but maybe the sirens will get their attention.  If the Tigers start fielding offers for Price the way USA Today indicated, then he immediately takes cuts to the front of the line ahead of Cole Hamels and Johnny Cueto, which moves Jeff Samardzija back in the trade rotation.  But the more interesting story is the Cubs. They’ve been rumored as the leader in the clubhouse to sign Price when he hits free agency this winter for reasons ranging from Joe Maddon, Price’s World Series manager in Tampa Bay who has the Cubs in a playoff spot, to Derek Johnson, Price’s pitching coach at Vanderbilt who serves as the Cubs minor-league pitching coordinator.  And then there’s this Twitter conversation Monday that started with Jon Lester loving Jake Arrieta’s outing against the Braves on Sunday. A fan jumped in to suggest that after the “great 1-2 punch’’ of Lester and Arrieta, Price would make “an excellent #3.’’  Arrieta responded with just “Price a #3?’’ To which Price tweeted: “Jake I always loved you ... but that right there makes me love u more!!’’  I think we can all feel the love of Price in a Cubs uniform. An ace as wasted on the Tigers as Chris Sale is on the White Sox, Price began the week with a 2.32 ERA that would become the best on the Cubs.  Price is averaging 8.66 strikeouts per nine innings and 1.77 walks per nine innings, both better than his career averages, and entering play Tuesday with the Tigers at .500, Fangraphs.com calculated Price’s pitcher’s Wins Above Replacement at 3.5.  For context, Price’s WAR ranked eighth in the majors, just behind Twitter buddy Arrieta’s 3.7 and well ahead of Twitter buddy Lester’s 2.5.  So why wait?  Here’s why:  Trading for Price by the July 31 deadline would cover only a half-season in the Cubs' attempt to reach a coin-flip playoff game at a cost of any number of those highly regarded prospects who were supposed to be the payoff for Cubs' tanking the last three seasons.  In free agency this winter, however, Price will only cost the Cubs money. We’ve seen they’re willing to spend it, especially on pitching, from Lester’s $155 million to their $100 million-plus bid on Masahiro Tanaka to eating $15.6 million of Edwin Jackson’s contract after designating him for assignment Sunday.  I don't see how the Cubs can fork over a chunk of their farm system in that scenario, but there is an angle that makes it palatable:  Cut a deal with the Tigers only after Price agrees to sign a new contract that guarantees his Cubs future into the next decade.  Don’t wait for free agency. Prospects and a major league player or two is the cost of hijacking the best free agent before he becomes a free agent.  Play out the free-agent craziness now. Start at Lester’s numbers. Expect to reach Max Scherzer’s pay. Ballpark figure: close to $30 million a year for seven years and an option for an eighth.  The Cubs certainly expect to go shopping in that kind of neighborhood this winter, so get it done now, before the Yankees hit the ATM.  At 29, Price is in the window that Theo Epstein considers a player’s prime. Combine Price’s age with his 2015 numbers that match or exceed his career averages, and he’s the kind of pitcher for whom the Cubs always planned to trade their young chips.  That time was seen as the future. But then the Cubs snagged Lester and jumped on Maddon, and the schedule appears to be pushed up at least a season. Keep pushing.  Epstein declared that every season is sacred. Here’s a way to back that up this season and long-term."
Cubs,3e2hzl,captainbuttercream,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:45:26 2015 UTC,"The article really doesn't make any sense. If the Cubs are sure they can sign him in the off-season, why bother to ship off a package of prospects for a half-season rental when they already have a strong rotation? Ensuring he will sign an extension before trading for him doesn't change the fact that they WILL have to trade away talent.  A better bet would be to trade for an impact bat the Cubs can retain for a few years, and sign Price in the off-season."
Cubs,3e2hzl,gordjose91,4,Tue Jul 21 16:26:51 2015 UTC,The article makes sense. The writer is just playing out all scenarios for the reader.
Cubs,3e2hzl,Sasquatch7862,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:58:24 2015 UTC,The scenario proposed doesn't make sense to do though.
Cubs,3e2hzl,Marenum,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:30:35 2015 UTC,"Makes the most sense to me to just wait.. The deciding factor on whether or not we win the division will be our bats. Pitching has been doing its part especially as of late. I don't like the idea of trading away good bats to go after another pitcher especially if we can just sign him in the off season. I see no reason why the Cubs can't be the highest bidder for this guy. If we're trading away prospects, say good bye to some combination of schwarber, soler, baez, or vogelbach"
Cubs,3dykh2,lift_ticket83,4,Mon Jul 20 16:12:55 2015 UTC,So that's why it took so long to finish the bleacher rebuild

Cubs,3dw8zg,Zebrahead13,12,Mon Jul 20 01:33:38 2015 UTC,Dude worked hard and was a great teammate. Not sure I like the sentiment in the title of this thread
Cubs,3dw8zg,ggtbeatsliog,2,Mon Jul 20 06:04:39 2015 UTC,"While that may be true, this isn't little league. Did you have any confidence that he would get the job done when he was in games? I know I didn't.   It's not that I loved him personally getting released, but he seemed like one of the very few players Epstein guessed wrong on since he's been there and it was time cut the losses. It's a business and he's got millions of dollars to live off of until his next contract. He will be okay.   Hopefully that next contract is in the NL Central so his family doesn't have to relocate too far ;)."
Cubs,3dw8zg,awhawkeye,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:40:18 2015 UTC,"He is a nice guy and good teammate who just happened to be unable to perform at the level expected of him, and his large contract hurt the team. I wish him all the best, but he wasn't pulling his weight. As a person, I feel bad for him. As a Cubs fan, I am happy that I will never see him on the mound again."
Cubs,3dw8zg,epidemiologist,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:22:21 2015 UTC,"I'm in favor of the move, it was the right thing for the team, but he's a good guy and he tried his ass off. It sucks for him, and I won't celebrate that. We're still paying him, too, so that reflects probably the worst move we've made in the Theo era. Almost reminds me of people booing Alfonso Soriano at Wrigley. Yeah, he didn't live up to the money, but he was actually really good for us, and I don't think anybody worked as hard. Guys like that deserve respect regardless of results."
Cubs,3dw8zg,Marenum,2,Wed Jul 22 02:18:29 2015 UTC,The guy put in a lot of innings but his numbers were just bad.
Cubs,3dw8zg,Cleffer,2,Mon Jul 20 11:55:28 2015 UTC,DFA?
Cubs,3dw8zg,PiedrasNegras,2,Mon Jul 20 10:27:37 2015 UTC,Designated for Assignment. They released him.
Cubs,3dw8zg,trolling_thunder,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:39:38 2015 UTC,"He'll likely be out of the organization anyway, but being DFA'ed is not the same as being released."
Cubs,3dw8zg,plokiqaws,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:49:35 2015 UTC,"Yes and no. While yes, DFA'ing is not ACTUALLY a release in and of itself, as there are other options available, in this case...they released him.  He can't be outrighted, they're not going to reinstate him to the 40 man, and nobody is going to trade for that salary."

Cubs,3dusx8,olesmokeykylejo,7,Sun Jul 19 18:06:57 2015 UTC,Why? He's a core Cubs player for now
Cubs,3dusx8,urankabashi,-2,Sun Jul 19 19:47:28 2015 UTC,"He's been awful this year on the whole, that would be why. He's not the Starlin Castro we've become accustomed to the past five years, and the Cubs can't afford to let him be dead weight. Unfortunately there's not a great alternative right now, but if he's not out of this funk a month from now they need to start finding better alternatives. I think Javier Baez could be the best of those."
Cubs,3dusx8,Sha_Shiva,2,Sun Jul 19 22:25:02 2015 UTC,He hasn't been that Starlin Castro for a few years. Last year seemed like he was taking a step in the right direction but idk man.. I feel like when we trade him he'll take off again.
Cubs,3dusx8,mwadz5,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:28:12 2015 UTC,"Well 2013 was his one bad year and seemed like an outlier after last year. I'm sure he'll have more seasons similar to last year in his future, but we're really seeing how low he can go this year. He's clearly in a funk and eventually he'll get out of it, and on a bad Cubs team this wouldn't even be a question. But with Javy Baez coming back from injury and La Stella also being an option I think Starlin really has to step it up in order to keep playing every day for this team.  The problem is if they bench him then he really loses trade value, so it's a tough call, but the Cubs need to win games and need to get the best starting lineup for the playoffs if they make it."
Cubs,3dusx8,mwadz5,4,Sun Jul 19 22:49:03 2015 UTC,I would talk about benching dexter fowler before Castro. Fowler has not hit well has not gotten on base enough and we have Coghlan and Denorfia who are playing better.
Cubs,3dusx8,jreaston,3,Mon Jul 20 13:11:24 2015 UTC,"Fair point about Coghlan or Denorfia over Dexter, but he's been better than Castro offensively and overall. Starlin has a .259 wOBA and 59 wRC+ and has been worth -0.5 WAR according to fan graphs.  Fowler is at .303 wOBA, 89 wRC+ and 0.8 WAR.  But you're right, Denorfia definitely deserves more playing time"
Cubs,3dusx8,iDaulton,2,Mon Jul 20 14:54:23 2015 UTC,True that Castro has played worse than fowler. I just want something a little more out of our lead off man. His stolen bases are not making up for his poor obp and batting average. And I wish he would just catch the ball in the outfield instead of catching the ball belt high
Cubs,3dusx8,cpjacobs,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:33:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, agreed the Cubs could definitely use more out of the leadoff spot. Fowler seemed like he could fit that role, but he'd be better served down in the 9 hole now as the ""second lead off man."" Not sure who would take over the top spot though."
Cubs,3dusx8,iDaulton,3,Mon Jul 20 17:51:56 2015 UTC,He's come up with some huge hits in some tough spots this year.  Gotta stick with him for a while yet.
Cubs,3dusx8,trapper2530,2,Sun Jul 19 21:40:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he has been clutch at times for sure. It's nice that he's been able to provide value in specific spots even if he's not providing much value on the whole. They do need to stick with him for now, but he should only get so much rope at this point with how bad he's been overall, and with the Cubs actually trying to win this year."
Cubs,3dusx8,ShrewyLouie,-5,Sun Jul 19 22:27:28 2015 UTC,"something we've wondered for the past 4 years. (we meaning the Castro haters, not I.) Big fan of #13"
Cubs,3dusx8,iDaulton,6,Sun Jul 19 18:21:21 2015 UTC,"Who is we?  As a lifelong Cubs fan I have never thought that in the 4+ years he has been with us.  Removing him from a game as discipline for not hustling is a different story, but that hasn't been an issue really this year."
Cubs,3dusx8,ShrewyLouie,2,Sun Jul 19 19:06:19 2015 UTC,just stating the fact that the Castro haters out there have been looking for this answer for years and they will never get it. I'm a HUGE Starlin fan.
Cubs,3dusx8,iDaulton,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:09:10 2015 UTC,"For the record I am a huge Starlin fan as well, and would love to see him turn it around, but right now he is a liability and the Cubs do not lack for middle infield depth. Javy Baez could definitely be a better option once he's fully healthy."
Cubs,3dusx8,iDaulton,3,Sun Jul 19 22:29:35 2015 UTC,You really wanted to bench a 21 year old who is leading the league in hits and hit .307. Or last year when he hit .292 and and 14 HR in 130 games?
Cubs,3dusx8,trapper2530,2,Sun Jul 19 19:01:43 2015 UTC,14HR from a MLB shortstop who has trouble making little league level plays far too often.  There are better options.
Cubs,3dusx8,iDaulton,-1,Sun Jul 19 20:09:31 2015 UTC,"not very sure i agree with this. yes he makes errors but that's not why he's here. he's having a down year but he rakes. 25 years old and only 69 hits away from 1,000. Also his range his range is improving every game."
Cubs,3dusx8,trapper2530,3,Sun Jul 19 20:18:14 2015 UTC,"Rakes? Haha, if someone would stand in between shortstop and 3rd and Castro would hit .200"

Cubs,3dvspw,Zebrahead13,5,Sun Jul 19 23:10:22 2015 UTC,He is a hard working veteran who knows how to call a game and mentor pitchers. Players like that become extra valuable on a young team like the Cubs. Think crash Davis in Bull Durham.
Cubs,3dvspw,Garndtz,4,Mon Jul 20 01:56:57 2015 UTC,"Ross's defense IS hugely valuable, including skill as a pitch-framer (something many analysts- and it would seem the Cubs' front office- believe to be EXTREMELY valuable). He is also a tremendous presence in the clubhouse, as a leader and in terms of working with the pitching staff- not to mention the effect he can have on the development of a young guy like Kyle Schwarber.  This guy isn't eating a roster spot; he's helping the Cubs win a lot.  Back-up catchers don't get their value from batting average; they get it from the things Ross is doing at a high level."

Joe can call the game from the dugout and as long as he can stop the ball from hitting the backstop every other time I think he'll be alright. He just threw out Byron Buxton about a month ago which is a highly touted prospect that runs a 60 in about 6.5 secs. Also, why would he be catching in AAA if he's such a poor catcher.

Cubs,3di0td,lou3189,2,Thu Jul 16 14:19:16 2015 UTC,"There's a groupon you can buy for a helicopter tour of the city.  Coupon code MAGIC20 and its yours for 206. Or do the boat architecture tour (lot less money) If you are a craft beer nut: Lagunitas, Revolution, and Half Acre. And maybe Goose Island cuz it's in Wrigleyville   Navy Pier is fun but touristy."
Cubs,3di0td,SillyTilly,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:26:50 2015 UTC,If you are looking to see some baseball history you can visit the Billy Goat Tavern. Where the curse of the cubs originated. The goat is mounted on the wall and everything.

Cubs,3di0td,_Guinness,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:17:56 2015 UTC,"These are all excellent recommendations. I would just add one thing.   Just before you start that walk, up the breezeway, to your seats ... stop, take a breath, and focus. Let the field open up to you. This is always my favorite moment."
Cubs,3dbgyt,JoakimNoahsRazor,6,Tue Jul 14 23:51:33 2015 UTC,"Pretty hard to argue these four. I suppose you could throw Cap Anson in there statistically speaking, but I think that's just too far back in time. Sosa might have an edge over Billy Williams just for leading the franchise in homers, but, you know."
Cubs,3dbgyt,Marenum,3,Wed Jul 15 03:31:08 2015 UTC,"3 Finger Brown, Hack Wilson and maybe Frank Chance as well, but i suspect the latter two didn't play with them long enough. What about Gabby Hartnett instead of Santo?"
Cubs,3dbgyt,HTWC,2,Wed Jul 15 07:12:45 2015 UTC,Santo and Banks both contributed to the organization well beyond their playing years.  Can't get rid of them.  I still hold 3-finger Brown deserves to be up there because he was the ace who got us the series how many times? Twice?
Cubs,3dbgyt,weeglos,2,Wed Jul 15 12:32:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah Mordecai is a strong argument as well. Hartnett played for us longer than Ronnie did, but Santo still has better numbers. Plus it's impossible not to love Ron Santo. Kind of fun going back and comparing stats of the best Cubs of all time."
Cubs,3dbgyt,Marenum,4,Wed Jul 15 14:46:25 2015 UTC,"I hope that, in like, twenty-five years, people will be arguing that Kris and Anthony should be slotted in there somehow."
Cubs,3dbgyt,ResidentialEvil,3,Wed Jul 15 14:01:26 2015 UTC,I would have said Three Finger Brown instead of Williams. Still a great list.
Cubs,3dbgyt,CBSP14,3,Wed Jul 15 01:44:51 2015 UTC,But Brown's number isn't hanging off of a foul pole.

We were sitting in the bleachers. He threw up on himself before the game even started. Passed out by the 1st inning. When he finally came to we all started chanting Way to go Larry. Then someone sent him a beer. He started throwing up all over again. He left around the 3rd or 4th inning being half carried by his Cub fan friend."

Cubs,3d0pw1,music3k,2,Sun Jul 12 19:31:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Comcast is ass. If you are ok with downloading another app, there is a CSN Chicago app in the App Store. If you are on an iPad it might not show up at first when you search for it. So if it doesn't, make sure you adjust the search terms in the top left corner to include iPhone apps (iPhone apps work fine on tablet, don't worry.) it looks like there is another option in the other comment in this thread.

Cubs,3czlc1,PunkRockMcLovin,6,Sun Jul 12 06:18:53 2015 UTC,"Everyone calls it ""the bean"". If you're anywhere by right field, down the foul line, check out the Decade Diner. I just found it during the last game I went to. Best beer and food selection in the park."
Cubs,3czlc1,GoodyFourShoes,3,Sun Jul 12 15:16:20 2015 UTC,"To add onto the food tip... Decade Diner is good, though if $$ is a concern, also remember you can take in your own food and (nonalcoholic, unopened) drinks. I always stop by 7-11 before a game.

Cubs,3cqndu,Anicole2196,30,Fri Jul 10 00:13:12 2015 UTC,"Not his fault at all. Pitching imploded, and Alex Gonzalez missed that easy ground ball. Fact is if it wasn't for Bartman, Gonzalez would be remembered like Bill Buckner."
Cubs,3cqndu,goodgamble,11,Fri Jul 10 00:58:17 2015 UTC,Plus there was a game 7. And Wood started it. And he hit a homer to tie that game early on and Wrigley looked like it was going to shake to the ground after that happened. And the Cubs were up in that game. A lot of people forget all that too.
Cubs,3cqndu,kkingprior,2,Fri Jul 10 03:15:42 2015 UTC,"I remember that moment so vividly on tv.  Watching it.  I knew that they were going to win game 7 at that moment.  All the crap from game 6 was going to be but a quirky anecdote to their story.  The Cubs hadn't lost back to back Prior/Wood games since something like May.  It was absurd.  Ugh.  it still hurts, man."
Cubs,3cqndu,thezars,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:11:32 2015 UTC,There was a game 7 but if I remember correctly in the documentary i believe Moises Alou said after game 6 him and a few other bought plane tickets to go home. So if thats true that means there were players that just checked out and didnt give their all in that last game because of what happened in game 6.
Cubs,3cqndu,CoweedandCannibus,2,Fri Jul 10 13:11:08 2015 UTC,Nope. Cubs had home field advantage in the series and it goes 2-3-2 (home-away-home).
Cubs,3cqndu,kkingprior,9,Fri Jul 10 10:11:23 2015 UTC,"This exactly. The night it happened, I don't remember being all that pissed at bartman. I remember being pissed at Gonzalez though. I was a little surprised at how much the Bartman thing blew up over the next couple of days."
Cubs,3cqndu,RusDelva,5,Fri Jul 10 12:00:00 2015 UTC,Can't say it enough. 100% on Gonzalez. A major league shortstop has a routine grounder hit to him and he can't handle it. Even Castro would field that properly!
Cubs,3cqndu,tmh8901,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:16:29 2015 UTC,He even had a .984 fielding percentage that year!
Cubs,3cqndu,ethanolin,0,Fri Jul 10 13:02:16 2015 UTC,"For anyone who didn't catch it, the Bartman documentary they did a few years back was very, very well done. And it completely changed my outlook on the whole situation.   I didn't want to string bartman up, like many did, but I didn't like the guy either. And after watching, I just wanted to give the guy a hug.  He made a mistake, and now he forever lives paranoid and hidden. That isn't right."
Cubs,3cqndu,_Guinness,5,Fri Jul 10 13:40:34 2015 UTC,"I agree work what other people said. I didn't blame him, and I didn't think anyone else did until our became a thing the next day. A great defensive shortstop booting an easy ground ball should be blamed if people need one moment. Also, a lot of people don't seem to remember that the Cubs had multiple chances after the Bartman incident. There was an entire game!"
Cubs,3cqndu,kevners,6,Fri Jul 10 15:24:37 2015 UTC,Not to mention Dusty left our rookie pitcher in who threw something like 120 pitches and gave up hit after hit post-incident. They erased that lead over multiple hits with multiple opportunities for a mound visit.
Cubs,3cqndu,chicagofan98,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:33:03 2015 UTC,Yeah it was painful watching Prior not be able to find the zone with the breaking ball and being forced to throw only fastballs.
Cubs,3cqndu,thenuge26,2,Fri Jul 10 02:58:26 2015 UTC,"Exactly. First, it was a foul ball that wasn't an easy catch even if it wasn't interfered with. It was against the wall. Game 7 they easily could have won. I personally blame it on the team, of course"

Cubs,3cqndu,MileyCyrus8,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:49:28 2015 UTC,Prior went all emo going into the dugout too after the Lee double. I know its meatbally to talk about body language but he looked so dejected and it just changed the entire game.
Cubs,3cqndu,redd1t4l1fe,5,Fri Jul 10 01:15:11 2015 UTC,"No one blamed Bartman until the next day?  If you watch the 30 for 30, a lot of it is about how chicago fans at the game threw beer on him, threatened his life repeatedly, and probably would have seriously hurt him if not for security."
Cubs,3cqndu,redd1t4l1fe,4,Fri Jul 10 05:08:03 2015 UTC,"You're wrong, just watch the documentary.  He did not get kicked out, he was escorted out because he was being verbally attacked by so many fans.  It was not a small group of people, the whole stadium was chanting ""ass hole"", inside and even OUTSIDE the stadium.  lol. The documentary clearly shows footage from the game, and he was being threatened quite maliciously by nearly everyone that realized who he was.  He also got multiple death threats consistently for awhile after the game.  You're confused my friend."
Cubs,3cqndu,redd1t4l1fe,5,Fri Jul 10 15:20:09 2015 UTC,"I saw and heard video footage, I'm afraid I believe my own eyes and ears over some random person on the internet.  Every word of what I said can be seen in the documentary, and it is ESPN, exactly what agenda did they have?  Why would they have any reason at all to lie?  They would not benefit in the slightest.  And I don't know why I'm even entertaining that notion, because I saw it with my own two eyes.  Are you seriously suggesting they added fake voices yelling ""asshole"" throughout the entire stadium?  Are you suggesting the video I saw of people screaming and taunting him all over the place was digitally created by pixar or something?  get serious dude."
Cubs,3cqndu,exquisitevagina,2,Fri Jul 10 17:45:04 2015 UTC,"You are deaf or altering your own memories. The ""asshole"" chants could be heard loud and clear on the live broadcast. I remember it vividly. Are you claiming that ESPN doctored video that blatantly?"
Cubs,3cqndu,exquisitevagina,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:41:51 2015 UTC,"I agree that looking back, most Cubs fans do not blame Bartman and it is more of a perception than a reality. But your comments make it sound like you deny the ""asshole"" chants, which did occur. Also he was 100% kicked out because security could not prevent people from harassing him. Many Cubs staff are on record saying they did not escort him out until people began throwing stuff at him. So while now, almost no one blames Bartman, it's just a historical fact that mob mentality got to Cubs fans at Wrigley that night, and that they acted pretty abhorrently."
Cubs,3cqndu,dickcomments,3,Fri Jul 10 01:57:03 2015 UTC,"Yes, it was Bartman's fault, but not exactly for why you might expect. Here goes:  Everyone talks about the wheels falling off for pitching, or the easy grounder error; however, we simply don't know if those things would have happened if Bartman wasn't involved.  Everyone assumes they would because they are looking at hindsight with 20/20 vision. They don't blame him because they really know what happened  (reality) after his involvement  vs. the countless possible realities had he not been involved.     Put it this way: A dog runs into the street, into traffic, and a car veers to avoid it but ended up hitting a second car, obviously the dog started the chain of events.   So, the Bartman  play happens, emotions erupted and focus is lost, focus is lost and poor judgement plays a loss.  Now remove that. The Bartman play doesn't happen, no focus is lost, wheels don't come off the train.  Bottom line: His actions set in motion the events that happened after."
Cubs,3cqndu,CoweedandCannibus,2,Fri Jul 10 02:12:34 2015 UTC,"This is my thought process exactly. A little blame can also be put onto Alou for reacting like a 6 yr old whose mom said he couldnt have another cookie. If he would have just calmed down and got back into position I think no one would have thought twice about Bartman.  Also, I believe fan interference could have been called but wasnt for some reason. Not sure if there was an explanation back then but I eont remember.   And finally, the players on the Cubs arent sheltered. They know all the omens and curses surrounding the Cubs (whether they believr them or not) and when that happened in game 6 I believe it got in their heads and they started thinking too much.  But as you said without Bartman, Moises wouldnt have anyway hing to react to, there would be no fan inteference, and the team would have had a clear head."

Cubs,3cqndu,jedimasterchief,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:31:02 2015 UTC,"I was in freshman year, high school. My English teacher was a Cubs fan and we were all talking about game 6. Prior on the mound, at home and Wood on the mound in a game 7 at home as well. He casually mentioned he didn't think we'd get to the World Series. All the Cubs fans were incredulous that he would say such a thing. He responded ""you know nothing, sweet summer children"" (might be paraphrasing here with the quote). He had been through it all, and knew that the lovable Cubbies would manage to screw it up.  Later that night after the bottom of the 7th during a commercial, I distinctly remember going into the kitchen to make myself a nice snack of cookies and milk and laughing to myself at how silly my teacher was. Prior had allowed 3 hits to this point and had mowed down the last 8 batters (I had to wikipedia the details) so I was feeling good.   I didn't even watch the rest of the game after it went to 7-3.   Game 7 was a blur. My dad was at the game and my mom was at home (having been to Game 6 the night before). My brothers and I were in the den watching the game while she was in the kitchen doing dishes and being as far away from the TV as possible. Again, I wondered why another adult Cubs fan would be so...distant when their team was about to win (Wood homers with that ridiculous red bat of his!!!!)  Since then, I know what my English teacher was talking about. That series, I feel, made me a true Cubs fan. I've had my hopes built up only to be knocked down.  Since then I've weathered through the seemingly impossible choke at the end of the 2004 season, their alarmingly rapid decline the next two seasons, then two lackluster playoff bids, and then the horrid decline to one of the worst teams in baseball."

Cubs,3cq08z,bradasaurus85,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:28:18 2015 UTC,"You can't get to the bleachers from the main area. Though I think you can go from the bleachers to the main area, and back to the bleachers, with a bleachers ticket?  If you are taking the red line, when you exit the station take a right and exit to the alley, then take a left in the alley.  If you go the ""main"" way it is usually crowded and you wait to cross the street.   Buy water if you want before the game. Its $1 outside the stadium and you can bring them in IF the bottle is sealed. Do this with peanuts as well as they are cheaper outside.  If you or anyone has a bag, it will have to be searched."

Cubs,3ci6m1,Duese,2,Wed Jul 8 02:47:56 2015 UTC,"Yea, unfortunately I don't know enough about baseball, so I don't know what the exact rules are on how they determine if a ball is out.  It looked to me like the ball started out of bounds and then somehow corkscrewed back in and went just on the inside of the 1st base bag."
Cubs,3ci6m1,jamfan40,2,Wed Jul 8 03:22:15 2015 UTC,Still think this was a fair ball clearly.  Seems like it went over the bag and it never went foul in this shot http://i.imgur.com/ZGmfo05.gif
Cubs,3ci6m1,ethanolin,2,Wed Jul 8 05:01:17 2015 UTC,"Here are the official rules for foul balls:   A FOUL BALL is a batted ball that settles on foul territory between home and first base, or between home and third base, or that bounds past first or third base on or over foul territory, or that first falls on foul territory beyond first or third base, or that, while on or over foul territory, touches the person of an umpire or player, or any object foreign to the natural ground. A foul fly shall be judged according to the relative position of the ball and the foul line, including the foul pole, and not as to whether the infielder is on foul or fair territory at the time he touches the ball. Rule 2.00 (Foul Ball) Comment: A batted ball not touched by a fielder, which hits the pitchers rubber and rebounds into foul territory, between home and first, or between home and third base is a foul ball   The most important word here, I think, is settles. Because the ball kept going (didn't settle) when it presumably bounced in foul territory and then went over first base (which is fair territory), it's a fair ball.  I was confused as well and had to look it up. It's kind of confusing since this scenario isn't exactly spelled out in the rules, but I think it's pretty clear.   On a somewhat related note, when they said the pitcher was ejected I really couldn't believe it and was mad at the umps. But then I saw he was all the way over in the outfield arguing with the first base ump and it made sense."

Cubs,3cbs51,Savage9645,16,Mon Jul 6 18:05:08 2015 UTC,"It's a tradition in my family to ""round all the bases"" (bars) before the game which just means having a beer at a bar on the respective baseline.  Usually The Dugout (1B), Murphys (2B), Bernies (3B), and the Cubby Bear (home)."
Cubs,3cbs51,Soundtribe33,10,Mon Jul 6 19:32:12 2015 UTC,"I have no idea why I have never thought of this.  Cheers to you, good sir."

Cubs,3cbs51,PurpleUrkle,8,Mon Jul 6 23:30:28 2015 UTC,"My personal favorite spot to sit is the bleachers, especially if you love drinking you'll always find a fun crowd there. We went right when they opened up the left field bleachers and it's gorgeous, definitely a great Wrigley experience."
Cubs,3cbs51,keuhlenhake,8,Mon Jul 6 18:50:30 2015 UTC,So are bleachers just general admission and you can sit in any empty seat? That's how it seemed on stubhub.
Cubs,3cbs51,DonShetland,10,Mon Jul 6 19:12:48 2015 UTC,"First come first serve. show up late and your standing the whole game, like an asshole."
Cubs,3cbs51,keuhlenhake,3,Mon Jul 6 19:31:15 2015 UTC,"Yep, be warned though it's not connected to the rest of Wrigley, it is its own section. If you get there early there's a chance for a ball from batting practice going over as well."
Cubs,3cbs51,Fr0styy,3,Mon Jul 6 19:21:09 2015 UTC,Interesting. I'm all for the bleachers but am I going to be missing out on anything if I don't have access to the rest of the park. Was thinking about getting to the stadium early and walking around a bit.
Cubs,3cbs51,keuhlenhake,4,Mon Jul 6 19:29:18 2015 UTC,"You can also walk into the main area of the stadium through a door in right field. They will ask to see your ticket but you can come and go as you please. The only thing is since it's GA you won't have a seat to go back to unless someone stays. I've always found a spot to sit though and I am in the bleachers most of the time when I go. Anywhere is great really, but the bleachers just have a little something special about them."
Cubs,3cbs51,gtautumn,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:44:30 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you want to see, the bleachers are a fun spot in the sun, lively crowd, and a good view, but you won't be able to see the old inside of Wrigley or explore for different photo opportunities. Especially for your price range (I'm a broke college student so I understand) I'll take bleachers any day. You have wrigleyville and all sorts of bars to explore before and after still, but again everyone's opinions different."

Cubs,3cbs51,joshamania,2,Mon Jul 6 21:34:19 2015 UTC,"Here is the quite non-traditional way that my wife and I saw the game and the city for the weekend:  We stayed at the Westin on Michigan Avenue (got a crazy good deal on a room).  We actually walked from the hotel to the game which was a pretty good hike (about 5 miles), but it let us see a lot of really cool stuff on the way.  We went up to the beach, walked through Lincoln Park and the Zoo then some really cool neighborhoods on the way there.  Also TONS of local food spots on the way.   The next day we left the hotel and just started walking around - it was the first time I'd been to the city.  We walked to the Willis (Sears) tower, Navy Pier, Millennium Park.  There is so much to see in a relatively close area (on Michigan Ave).  Had a blast - PM me if you want any additional details."

Cubs,3cbs51,isuxirl,2,Mon Jul 6 19:13:12 2015 UTC,"If you can swing it, I'm particular to sections 420/421 and those nearby.  420 is in the upper deck box seats, directly behind home plate.  It offers, in my opinion, the best view of the entire park.  You're right on top of the game in those seats.  It is very near the best concessions in the park, the sundeck and relatively close to facilities needful to people imbibing large quantities of beer."
Cubs,3cbs51,Naranjas1,2,Mon Jul 6 23:41:39 2015 UTC,"Yup. Love those seats. I've sat a few rows behind home plate before and, while it was nice being close to the action, I didn't get that full game perspective you can get from those seats. Love seeing outfielders track fly balls and lay out occasionally. Plus, unless you're in the first row, a lot tends to be blocked by people's heads"
Cubs,3cbs51,ethanolin,2,Wed Jul 8 14:24:50 2015 UTC,"I'm a Yankee fan in the post season (nice to cheer for a winning team). Check out Harry Caray's restaurant! Also if you haven't booked a hotel yet, check out Best Western River North. Nice rooms for around $100 and free parking! We usually stay there and cab it since we save so much on room/parking.

Cubs,3cc5fl,imboredmuch,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:45:21 2015 UTC,There's an app called gametime that lets you purchase a ticket an hour into the game if you're late. There's also free parking past ashland and addison leaving you with a 20 minute walk. What airport? try using a uber fare estimator from google. My 20 minute trips from home before the game usually come out to be 20 bucks.
Cubs,3cc5fl,imboredmuch,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:43:38 2015 UTC,Thanks. I updated my info.  Uber Estimator is screwy because I'm going to be in the airport. I can only do Uber black from that location.  I'm not going to drive since I won't have a rental  I'll look for a location just outside the airport and maybe do it that way. Is the train to bus too complicated for a hick not used to public tranportation?
Cubs,3cc5fl,imboredmuch,2,Mon Jul 6 19:53:55 2015 UTC,You should be fine. There's also a couple city transit apps that work well in telling you arrival times. The one I use is chicago transit cta. It's precise and works. But to be honest you really don't need it. You'll be okay. You can also take a free hotel shuttle and take a uber from there since you can only do uber black from the airport.
Cubs,3cc5fl,HTWC,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:02:14 2015 UTC,Great idea about the shuttle!  I will look into it. Thanks for the advice.
Cubs,3cc5fl,HTWC,0,Mon Jul 6 20:12:18 2015 UTC,"Avoid Uber. It's a loathsome right wing-libertarian fantasy that screws everyone involved. Chicago has the cheapest cabs in the country and they are easy to hail and can be made even easier by Curb app. A licensed, insured and regulated driver with all of his or her relevant information will be posted as well as the cab number should you forget something. If you have any complaints or want to give a compliment to a driver, there's an easy 3 digit number to call to do so for all cabs in the city. Taking the Blue line to the Red is a pain because you have to go all the way downtown. Take the blue line to Addison and it's a quick cab ride to the Field. Have a great game!"
Cubs,3cc5fl,HTWC,2,Mon Jul 6 20:28:01 2015 UTC,Great advice!  That seems pretty easy.
Cubs,3cc5fl,True_to_you,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:31:54 2015 UTC,Its only 3.2 miles from the blueline. I walk further all the time. Is it a safe doable walk?
Cubs,3cc5fl,True_to_you,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:24:57 2015 UTC,"It's very safe! It might be warm and you'll be walking around a lot at the stadium so personally I'd cab it, but different strokes! It might be hot, but as a Texan that's nothing you can't handle. I'd probably recommend walking in that direction and hailing a cab if one comes by but not going to any heroic measures if it doesn't."

The trade deadline is upon us and we're in good position to compete for a playoff spot (as a wild card but still).   The core of our team is with us until 2020 and will only get better, our glaring weakness can be improved rather easily through free agency this year. We're in good shape to be in the playoffs every year for the next half decade.  But other than that, yeah, Ricketts and Co suck."
Cubs,3c7eh4,glberns,2,Sun Jul 5 16:57:29 2015 UTC,It's either an obvious troll or someone who regularly comments on YouTube videos. Either way it's not even worth a rebuttal like this.

Cubs,3brlui,Couldthisbetheyear,3,Wed Jul 1 16:14:25 2015 UTC,I couldn't agree more. Castro and Fowler need to start getting that BA up near .290
Cubs,3brlui,YoYoMeh,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:01:02 2015 UTC,For Fowler it's more about his OBP getting back to his career average of .361.  When he gets on base the Cubs winning percentage is over 70%!  I wonder how much the varying strike zone at the lower third of the zone this season is messing with Fowler.  There have been some good articles written on it though.  Castro has never been the type to take many walks.  In his case you couldn't be more correct.  His BA needs to get out of the cellar.

Cubs,3bpeii,maskedupvillain,3,Wed Jul 1 02:14:01 2015 UTC,"It would take ALOT. Probably something like Russell, Edwards, Vogelbach, and a low level pitcher. Important to remember that Sale is on a VERY team friendly deal through 2019."
Cubs,3bpeii,petex13,3,Wed Jul 1 05:31:22 2015 UTC,"Couldn't agree with Petex more.  It may actually take more than that (extremely aggressive by most standards) package.  I say this for a multitude of reasons.  1-  Sale is still pre-prime age.  He will BEGIN his prime either next season or the season thereafter.  2-  This side of Kershaw, Sale is the best lefty in baseball on a team that is desperately in need to acquire as many assets as possible.  3-  Sale is a player a team builds around, not trades away.  By this I mean it will A) Require more to pry him loose.  B) There will be significant competition to acquire him/absolute lopsided trades offered from the likes of teams like the Yanks, Red Sox, Angels, etc.  4-  A very minor factor, but a factor nonetheless, the Cubs are the ""hated cross-town rival"".  While emotion has no place in business and business transactions, it often does play a part.  Being the cross-town rival may play a determining role if the Cubs were to offer a similar type package as other teams.  If the Cubs were to attempt to acquire Sale they would need to drastically overpay.  I wouldn't be surprised at all if the Sox asked for Russell AND Schwarber, as well as the rest of petex's package.  Theo would almost certainly be doubled-over laughing as he hung up the phone after hearing that asking price, but it wouldn't surprise me at all if that is where the Sox started with negotiations.  A realistic package would most likely include Russell or Schwarber, Baez, Vogelbach, CJ Edwards, Corey Black, and Gleybor Torres.  It's an especially steep price, but consider both the caliber of the player the Cubs are attempting to acquire AND the steep level of competition there will be for Sale.  Effectively, teams would open up their entire farm systems and say go ahead and pick who you want if Sale were put on the trading block."
Cubs,3bpeii,Couldthisbetheyear,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:20:11 2015 UTC,Agree 100% with you. Trades like this rarely happen because both sides have such a different perceived value of what they are asking for and what they are giving up.

Cubs,3bh0hs,Jmath616,5,Mon Jun 29 03:46:11 2015 UTC,Also he pitched a gem only 8 days ago in Minnesota.  Earlier offense that day would have earned him a win.  Side note: Don't judge a pitcher strictly by their win-loss record.

Cubs,3baxn3,elizabethherrying,16,Sat Jun 27 13:51:12 2015 UTC,"My favorite Pat and Ron moment.   They were broadcasting a game on Pat's birthday. I decided to send an email wishing Pat a happy birthday, but I wanted a shot at having it read on the air. So, I worded it something like this ... ""I would like to wish Pat a very happy birthday, but first I just want to mention that Ron Santo is an extremely handsome, intelligent, and virile man. ...""  Ron read my email on the air! While he was reading the part about himself, Pat was laughing and said, ""Boy, this guy knows how to get an email read on the air."" They both had a chuckle. It was fantastic. I still get a little emotional when I think of it."

Cubs,3bcgf5,whitesox20051,2,Sat Jun 27 22:16:46 2015 UTC,"This is interesting because the Cubs are currently 2nd in the NL in team xFIP for the starting staff, and 3rd overall. It isn't like they've had bad pitching. I know the back of the rotation could be better and depth isn't fantastic if you're running Roach out there, but in reality the average major league #5 puts up an ERA of around 5.5-6. Wada and Wood are terrific fifth starters.  Meanwhile the Cubs are 10th in runs scored, but it isn't easy to upgrade the obvious weak link in Castro. And there's the hope that he'll come around and make his friendly contract useful."

Cubs,3b5oq8,olemisscub,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:49:43 2015 UTC,It is Cubs.  Evidently Matty Brescia got them there for marketing purposes to help the owner of the stadium/team which had a large black clientele being Memphis.  Didn't help in the long run I gather as Martin's stadium was soon gone.  The photo actually appeared in the NY Times attributed this way.

As long as we don't get burned like when we signed Edwin Jackson and unfortunately it's looking like Lester is turning in to a bust, as well.  Harang and Pappelbon would definitely solve our core issue.  I've always liked both of them.  I'm wondering how Roach will do, today. He put up some good AAA stats before being called up to replace Wada, in the mean time.    I still think we need another bat, but pitching is what wins the WS and we need some improvement there."
Cubs,3b2y02,CubsBot,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:20:16 2015 UTC,It was nice of Lester to blow the game in the first 2 innings so I could turn it off and do some work. Also swell of the offense to not try and mount a comeback to bring me back.

I don't know which will actually be up for bid, as they have limited floor space, and the director of the event told me that they may save some for other events.  There will be a Chicago event later this year, and I'll be doing another event-specific piece with Jason, Rizzo, and Lester (and donating a few other Cubs-related pieces--I'm still making them, so I'm open to suggestions for other Cubbies you'd like to see!).   Regardless, having a mom who has had her own battles with cancer has made doing the work for the foundation all the more meaningful to me.

Cubs,3ay35c,_Guinness,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:36:45 2015 UTC,Well with division play I don't think it would work out that way at the end of season.  But I'd bet there were some damn good records that missed since there have only been 1 or 2 wild card spots.
Cubs,3ay35c,explosivo563,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:44:06 2015 UTC,"If you count the pre divisional play (before 1969) the 1909 Chicago Cubs hold the record for the most wins to not make the playoffs, they won 104 games and finished 6 back of the Pirates. Since divisional play I think it might be the 1993 Giants, I think they won 100 or 101 and finished 1 game back of the Braves (but I could be wrong on that ).

Since you've never been to chicago I was going to suggest staying downtown if you plan on doing much more than go to the game.   I just put in random dates so prices may change, but these are the neighborhoods you'd want to choose from. https://www.hotwire.com/mobile/hotel/results?searchTokenId=8674237083#/sort/value/total/10  Edit: just realized that the link didn't work, the neighbors you'd want to choose are the 2 mentioning ""mag mile"", ""downtown"" and ""lincoln park"". If you havnt used Hotwire before, you don't know what hotel you are staying in until after you book, you can pick neighborhoods and rating. For chicago, I always choose a downtown location and at least 3 stars and I've always been happy, probably done it over a dozen times.   If you are adventurous you can take the EL to the game (I, personally don't have much experience with it, I'm sure others here could know more), but there is always Uber which shouldn't be too expensive.   Have a great time!"

Cubs,38gnwc,CubsBot,2,Thu Jun 4 02:12:40 2015 UTC,So I'm only recently trying to get into baseball and I don't understand the between the lines elements of the game. Why was Lake watching his hr considered showboating? Do most players just run instantly when they know they hit one out? That seems to me like it shouldn't be a big deal at all.
Cubs,38gnwc,GodIsTheSun,1 point,Thu Jun 4 03:45:31 2015 UTC,"I had the same question when I started watching... Coming from a fútbol enviroment, to me, they didn't celebrate enough!  But they don't really like that in baseball. You can look for a bit while it flies away, but you have to keep your legs moving at a decent speed. Otherwise it feels like you're rubbing it in the pitcher's nose or something. Mostly fair play stuff to me. I've seen on YT videos about fights that started for things like these. Benches cleared and all."
Cubs,38gnwc,bullanguero82,2,Thu Jun 4 03:52:25 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's this. It's a very thin line between simply watching it to make sure it goes over the fence and isn't just a long out and gloating.   Junior Lake is young but he still knows this rule. It's almost common sense. If you do this, you better be the game's elite player and even then it's poor sportsmanship. But a rookie does not do this on accident.  But Maddon sent out a tweet showing he's not letting BS like this go, so that's good to hear."

Cubs,38gnwc,TweetsInCommentsBot,1 point,Thu Jun 4 12:40:15 2015 UTC,Been watching my whole life. Every situation is different when you hit a home run - and by this I mean the actual score of the game. The Cubs were losing 6-0 at the time. A 2 run homer makes it 6-2. Still down by 4. Imagine celebrating a goal scored when losing 4-0 to make it 4-1. Probably not much celebration for the goal.

Cubs,38cozn,PodForThought,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:16:02 2015 UTC,Does anyone else thing he would be better suited at second base? He would have more time to get rid of the ball and might make some more plays because of it.  Not to mention a lot more of his circus plays would turn into outs.
Cubs,38dhhq,agoddamnlegend,3,Wed Jun 3 14:38:23 2015 UTC,"Baez is actually killing it since coming back from his bereavement leave.  In AAA this season, he's now batting .325/.397/.550 in 120 ABs and his K rate is 24%. He's still only 22 and is showing vast improvement in his approach. That being said, he still hasn't proved himself at the big league level so I don't think there's really a market for him right now, even though the cubs are stacked with middle infielders. It really could go either way, but I think his upside is high enough that Theo and Jed want to keep him around to see if he pans out.  There's been a lot of talk about moving Bryant to the outfield and switching Castro to 3rd, with Russell playing short and Baez at 2nd. But nothing is certain as of now. Bryant has actually done pretty well defensively and there isn't really a reason to move him unless they really want to play all of those guys at the same time."
Cubs,38dhhq,jgrim0642,0,Wed Jun 3 16:23:06 2015 UTC,"he still hasn't proved himself at the big league level so I don't think there's really a market for him right now   Historically, Baseball Americas' top ten ranked overall prospects with less than one year of accrued service time carry significant trade value.    It really could go either way, but I think his upside is high enough that Theo and Jed want to keep him around to see if he pans out.   Baez was Jim Hendry's pick; He's not a Hoyer/ Epstein selection. When you look at what they value in an offensive skill set, it's everything Baez is not: A smart hitter with a critical eye for the strike zone who gets on base and works the count deep.   My guess is they package him with Vogelbach (who has no position on the Cubs so long as the NL bats pitchers) for an SP if they're in contention come July."

Cubs,38dhhq,JawjaFlrdaLine,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:26:02 2015 UTC,"There's absolutely nothing ""locked in"" about Bryant/Castro/Russell. Baez is a better defender than two of those players right out of the gate, and all three have the athleticism to be moved around the field as needed. The most likely scenarios are:  Bryant moves to left, Baez to 3B  Castro moves to 2B, Russell to SS (this is eventually the plan anyway; the Cubs like Russell as their Shortstop of the future), Baez or Bryant at 3B, with the odd man out in left.  Cubs trade Castro for a top of the rotation arm or a bundle of prospects, move Russell to SS, Baez to 2B.  Castro to 3B, Russell to SS, Baez to 2b, Bryant to LF. This is the least likely scenario just because the Cubs aren't sold on Castro at third, despite his arm."

Cubs,387q8y,HabitOfCreature,2,Tue Jun 2 20:59:16 2015 UTC,"I will. Starlin Castro in a Cub lineup where he cleans up after the middle of the order can be a weapon. Having a guy who can get 170+ hits a season following a bunch of guys who are going to be clogging the bases is going to lead to a lot of RBI even if he doesn't hit 20 HRs. I believe that the FO does realize that Starlin makes the lineup more dynamic and I don't think they plan on trading him.  Starlin, Baez, Almora, have a different approach that I think will make the pitcher change how he pitches to a team like how having a lineup that goes L R L R makes a pitcher change the way he has to pitch batter to batter.  I worry that some dumb team is going to add him and stick him in the 2 spot where he's not an OBP guy and will be absolutely wasted."
Cubs,387q8y,designgoddess,1 point,Tue Jun 2 22:55:11 2015 UTC,He's 25 with a lot of upside. I don't think they'll trade him either. Hopefully they can get him back on track. I'll never understand why they had to mess with the swing of a guy hitting over .300.
Cubs,387q8y,stackshot,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:12:39 2015 UTC,"Len Kasper consistently predicted this a handful of years ago: he said when this Cubs team is starting to turn a corner, Castro is going to be a 6th/7th hole hitter and likely gets switched infield positions.  It's the best way to squeeze value out of Starlin.  Sidenote: It's reaaaally jumping to gun to even dream of Almora in any major league lineup until he can produce in the minors. He has a .625 OPS his last two years..."
Cubs,388i5s,the_real_eel,2,Tue Jun 2 16:32:42 2015 UTC,"There is a lot of competition for the spots in the middle infield and Castro may not be the best option to stay there. If Fowler leaves to play elsewhere, it may be worth giving Castro a look in center. I would at least like to see him play some games in the outfield to give Russell some time at short."
Cubs,388i5s,captainbuttercream,1 point,Tue Jun 2 19:40:41 2015 UTC,"Agree. I'd like to see him get a few starts in center this season, maybe in the Fall. I like him at 2B, too, but like you said, Cubs have a lot of good infielders. If Baez figures it out....wow...."
Cubs,388i5s,stackshot,2,Tue Jun 2 23:38:30 2015 UTC,"I don't think many would bet money on Castro sticking at shortstop after this season.  He's going to be tried at 2B, 3B, and the OF. I think he could handle either infield position and actually become a more valuable defender."
Cubs,389nbl,CubsBot,2,Tue Jun 2 20:10:33 2015 UTC,"Loooking forward to this one.  Hopefully Hendricks can keep up his recent success.  Cubs' lineup: Fowler cf, bryant lf, Rizzo 1b, Lake rf, starlin ss, A Russell 2b, ross c, Hendricks p, Herrera 3b. Soler sore ankle."
Cubs,389nbl,Sofnr,3,Tue Jun 2 21:13:57 2015 UTC,"Hey, I assume you're part of the great migration from PSD, and just wanted to let you know that Cubs fans are now located at reddit.com/ r / c h i c u b s. Don't include the spaces, obviously, but I can't type it without the spaces because saying that is literally censored on this subreddit. It should give you a good idea as to why everyone abandoned this subreddit. Anyway, hope to see you and other former-PSD over at chi cubs! All are welcome!"
Cubs,389exz,tjb122982,1 point,Tue Jun 2 19:26:12 2015 UTC,"Funny enough there was some talk about this in the Cardinals PSD forum.  For kicks i looked at the last Cardinals home run.  It was Peralta a few days ago and he took 25 seconds to round the bases.  No doubt Starlin watched it a bit, and he's never exactly fast around the bases.  But it was really nothing special.  Just some Cards fans looking for something to talk about."
Cubs,385wco,CubsBot,6,Tue Jun 2 02:00:49 2015 UTC,go cubs go!
Cubs,385wco,tesd44,5,Tue Jun 2 02:09:53 2015 UTC,"Hey guys, I'm here because PSD sucks, what's up."
Cubs,385wco,bibbers01,3,Tue Jun 2 02:37:16 2015 UTC,Welcome Bibbers! I'm surprised that the rest of the crew isn't here. Yags getting booted pissed me off and I'm not even one of the cool kids. This could be a good place to be.
Cubs,385wco,iam2eeyore,2,Tue Jun 2 04:44:43 2015 UTC,Free yagyu.

Cubs,385wco,TLee21,2,Tue Jun 2 05:18:42 2015 UTC,Really appreciate the highlights being put up here.  I hope this sub is a great place for us true Cubs fans to chat about what's going on in the Cubbies system.

Cubs,383ch0,whitesox20051,3,Mon Jun 1 15:41:56 2015 UTC,The video in the article made me love Maddon even more than I already did.
Cubs,386k4r,AntawnSL,2,Tue Jun 2 05:22:44 2015 UTC,Wrong sub guys
Cubs,386k4r,ilovelamp42,1 point,Tue Jun 2 20:10:17 2015 UTC,I'm CubbieSteve   I posted porn links and disturbing images in most of every PSD thread just now. I was going for about an hour before I was banned. I'm sure they'll make it permanent in the morning. Yagyu was one of the only reasons I checked that site. I heard he was maybe here so I'll give it a shot.  Fuck Jeffy
Cubs,386k4r,CubbieSteve,0,Tue Jun 2 07:42:59 2015 UTC,I saw LaBibbers in another thread. I expected more to be here. I'd love to see this subreddit take off. It's dead compared to how PSD has been in the past.
Cubs,380cqs,amortizethis,4,Sun May 31 22:29:30 2015 UTC,You saw a good one today!
Cubs,380cqs,the_real_eel,3,Sun May 31 23:50:25 2015 UTC,"Games in June are usually warmer than that today, so you know."
Cubs,382ch2,Tal_Venada,2,Mon Jun 1 10:21:25 2015 UTC,"I think it's all about what would have to be given up to get him. If the Phillies are wanting multiple top 10 prospects it probably isn't worth it. Our biggest weakness is really our bullpen, if the Phillies would part with Papelbon for a reasonable price, I think that would be a smarter acquisition."
Cubs,382ch2,captainbuttercream,4,Mon Jun 1 13:37:36 2015 UTC,Exactly this.  I don't get any trade talk outside of acquiring bullpen help.  I love our starting 5.
Cubs,3809el,CubsBot,2,Sun May 31 22:04:39 2015 UTC,Good win today! !
Cubs,3809el,BrownMamba_42,1 point,Mon Jun 1 00:28:12 2015 UTC,It looked good from the 3rd row down RF line! The place was electric despite the chilly breeze from LF. Wrigley was bumpin' outta control!
Cubs,37yrd7,CubsBot,2,Sun May 31 15:20:16 2015 UTC,love the whales jerseys.
Cubs,380eos,Jgb2,3,Sun May 31 22:44:31 2015 UTC,"Moncada, Bogaerts, Betts."
Cubs,380eos,agoddamnlegend,0,Mon Jun 1 12:41:36 2015 UTC,"Also a Sox fan, and No.  Cherington is doing a good job, so no way I'd give him up for a guy (Lester) he was smart enough not to re-sign this offseason.  Not that Lester isn't good now, but IMO his contract will be pretty ugly by the tail end of it."
