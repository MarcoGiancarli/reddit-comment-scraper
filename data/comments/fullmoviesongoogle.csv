You may ask yourself why Happy Madison Productions deemed a film which has been reviewed so poorly across the board worthy of a sequel and the answer is quite simple, MONEY. The original film in the Paul Blart series earned over $146 million in the US alone. Since the inception of Happy Madison in the late 1990s the company has learned how to maximize profits by completely disregarding the opinions of any intelligent moviegoers and creating content specifically for the lowest common denominator (a.k.a. the average American). Paul Blart Mall Cop 2 is no exception to this and suffers from the same pitfalls as the original. Anyone brave enough to sit through the film will find themselves in a heated debate with those around them on the topic of which was worse the film's writing or it's acting; It's a trick question because they are both equally and immeasurably awful.  MINOR SPOILERS BELOW:  As the film begins our hero Paul Blart (James) finds himself suffering through some difficult times. Within a week of being married his wife (Mays)  filed for divorce, and his mother (Knight) has been run over by a milk truck.  Paul finally receives a bit of good news when he receives an invitation to a Las Vegas  security officers' trade convention. Paul then heads to Nevada with his daughter (Rodriguez) where he hopes to be an important speaker on the convention due to his past mall cop heroics.

Also, Bella Knox's facial abuse video is scary, knowing now that she probably wasn't just acting; that she probably got there and didn`t really know that they were going to slap her around, choke her, and mistreat her that bad, and her fear was probably genuine.

If you research streaming video in this way if that's your concern you'll see that it's a gray area right now and the general consensus in the community is that it isn't illegal.

If you're aware of the extensive efforts being made today to create this type of technology than you should realize that the psychological and existential concerns that are addressed in the film are very accurate and appropriate in relation to the science involved. This type of technology isn't theoretical it WILL happen, it's only a matter of time, and when it does the issues this movie focuses on will be very relevant.to further support my argument look up any lists or polls for the top ""hard sci-if"" movies of all time and you might notice that a great many of them feature psychological tension as a significant aspect of the story. Having one (science, psychology) in a film doesn't negate the other."

It starts as mid-level drug dealer, D'Angelo Barksdale beats a murder rap. After a conversation with a judge, Det. James McNulty has been assigned to lead a joint homicide and narcotics team, in order to bring down drug kingpin Avon Barksdale. Avon Barksdale, accompanied by his right-hand man Stringer Bell, enforcer Wee-Bey and many lieutenants (including his own nephew, D'Angelo Barksdale), has to deal with law enforcement, informants in his own camp, and competition with a local rival, Omar, who's been robbing Barksdale's dealers and reselling the drugs. The supervisor of the investigation, Lt. Cedric Daniels, has to deal with his own problems, such as a corrupt bureaucracy, some of his detectives beating suspects, hard-headed but determined Det. McNulty, and a blackmailing deputy. The show depicts the lives of every part of the drug ""food chain"", from junkies to dealers, and from cops to politicians. (IMDb)   Critical reception:   All seasons of The Wire have received rave reviews from many major television critics, several naming it the best contemporary show and one of the best drama series of all time. The first season received mainly positive reviews from critics, some even calling it superior to HBO's better-known ""flagship"" drama series such as The Sopranos and Six Feet Under. On the review aggregation website Metacritic, the first season scored 78 out of 100 based on 22 reviews. One reviewer pointed to the retread of some themes from HBO and David Simon's earlier works, but still found it valuable viewing and particularly resonant because it parallels the war on terror through the chronicling of the war on drugs. Another review postulated that the series might suffer because of its reliance on profanity and slowly drawn-out plot, but was largely positive about the show's characters and intrigue.

This is usually caused when the browser is having a difficult time managing all of the temporary streaming data. I would suggest the ExootCast HTML5 player, which uses a newer standard and should help reduce the likelihood of the audio getting out of sync. Use a modern browser, and simply refresh the page when you encounter problems. If these fixes do not solve the problem, download the file and watch it in VLC or MPV.  The risks are likely less than torrenting because your ISP cannot determine whether you are watching copyrighted material or merely using Google Drive. All other risks are the same.

When Olympic Gold Medal winning wrestler Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum) is invited by wealthy heir John du Pont (Steve Carell) to move on to the du Pont estate and help form a team to train for the 1988 Seoul Olympics at his new state-of-the-art training facility, Schultz jumps at the opportunity, hoping to focus on his training and finally step out of the shadow of his revered brother, Dave (Mark Ruffalo). Driven by hidden needs, du Pont sees backing Schultz's bid for Gold and the chance to ""coach"" a world-class wrestling team as an opportunity to gain the elusive respect of his peers and, more importantly, his disapproving mother (Vanessa Redgrave). Flattered by the attention and entranced by du Pont's majestic world, Mark comes to see his benefactor as a father figure and grows increasingly dependent on him for approval. Though initially supportive, du Pont's mercurial personality turns and he begins to lure Mark into an unhealthy lifestyle that threatens to undermine his training. Soon du Pont's erratic behavior and cruel psychological game-play begin to erode the athlete's already shaky self-esteem. Meanwhile du Pont becomes fixated on Dave, who exudes the confidence both he and Mark lack, knowing that these are things even his money cannot buy. Fueled by du Pont's increasing paranoia and alienation from the brothers, the trio is propelled towards a tragedy no one could have foreseen.

Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a score of 89% based on reviews from 56 critics, with an average score of 7/10, with the critical consensus listed as saying ""Sweet, beautifully filmed, and admirably short on sugarcoating, Bears continues Disneynature's winning streak"".

Rather than focus on Irish novelist Bram Stoker's 1897 novel Dracula, the film creates an origin story for its title character, Count Dracula, by portraying the story of Vlad the Impaler, of whom Stoker was unaware until he was well into writing that novel. Luke Evans portrays the title character, with Sarah Gadon and Dominic Cooper in supporting roles. (Wikipedia)     Critical reception:   Dracula Untold has received mixed reviews from critics, with many criticizing Dracula's characterization and pointing out many plot holes, but praising Luke Evans performance as well as the story and the visuals. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 24% based on 100 reviews, with an average rating of 4.5/10. The site's consensus reads, ""Neither awful enough to suck nor sharp enough to bite, Dracula Untold misses the point of its iconic character's deathless appeal."" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 40 out of 100, based on 30 critics, indicating ""mixed or average reviews"". Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter said, ""Much like the recent, widely reviled I, Frankenstein, this misconceived project mainly signals a need to go back to the drawing board."" The Village Voice's Alan Scherstuhl criticized the film, ""And so it was, and so it was dull, the greatest villain in all cinema bitten on the neck and drained of his hottest blood."" Kyle Anderson of the Entertainment Weekly didn't like the movie scoring it with grade ""C"", ""It works neither as a sweeping historical epic nor as an action-horror hybrid."" Stephen Whitty wrote the negative review for The Star-Ledger, ""If this Dracula can kill hundreds of enemies by himself - and he can, and does, in several dull and protracted battle scenes - then where's the suspense? If he's become a monster for noble reasons, then where's the dark conflict?"" The Seattle Times Moira MacDonald said, ""It falls into that far-too-large category of studio offerings that aren't good enough to be noteworthy or terrible enough to be truly entertaining.""

Later she becomes a half-vampire and Edgar advises that she drank vampire's blood and can only be saved if the head-vampire is killed. Chris and Edgar search the hiding place of Shane and his tribe to save Nicole. (IMDb)     Critical reception:   The film was Warner Premiere's highest selling DVD release of 2008, performing so impressively that Warner immediately greenlit a third installment. It covered its $5 million production cost in its first three weeks of release. As of January 2011, it has sold over 1,250,000 copies, a record for a direct-to-DVD release. Despite the success of the DVD, the film received poor reviews. Rotten Tomatoes gave the film 0% based on seven reviews.

As of May 2013, review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 31% of critics have given the film a positive review, based on 39 reviews, certifying it ""Rotten"", with an average rating of 4.4/10. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote that the ""failure in Hook was its inability to re-imagine the material, to find something new, fresh or urgent to do with the Peter Pan myth. Lacking that, Spielberg should simply have remade the original story, straight, for the '90s generation."" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone magazine felt Hook would ""only appeal to the baby boomer generation"" and highly criticized the sword-fighting choreography. Vincent Canby of The New York Times felt the story structure was not well balanced, feeling Spielberg depended too much on art direction. Hal Hinson of The Washington Post was one of few who gave the film a positive review. Hinson elaborated on crucial themes of children, adulthood and loss of innocence. However, he observed that Spielberg ""was stuck too much in a theme park world"".

That comes clear when Director Nick Fury is killed by the mysterious assassin, the Winter Soldier, but not before warning Rogers that SHIELD has been subverted by its enemies. When Rogers acts on Fury's warning to trust no one there, he is branded as a traitor by the organization. Now a fugitive, Captain America must get to the bottom of this deadly mystery with the help of the Black Widow and his new friend, The Falcon. However, the battle will be costly for the Sentinel of Liberty, with Rogers finding enemies where he least expects them while learning that the Winter Soldier looks disturbingly familiar.

A small excel spreadsheet was also shared to each account with the other movies/usernames/passwords to allow easy searching. That part all worked and the theory was proven to be feasible. Kind of.

Weiss  IMDb rating: ★★★★★★★★★★ 9.5/10 (574,820 votes)     Nine noble families fight for control of the mythical land of Westeros. Political and sexual intrigue is pervasive. Robert Baratheon, King of Westeros, asks his old friend Eddard, Lord Stark, to serve as Hand of the King, or highest official. Secretly warned that the previous Hand was assassinated, Eddard accepts in order to investigate further. Meanwhile the Queen's family, the Lannisters, may be hatching a plot to take power. Across the sea, the last members of the previous and deposed ruling family, the Targaryens, are also scheming to regain the throne. The friction between the houses Stark, Lannister, Baratheon and Targaryen and with the remaining great houses Greyjoy, Tully, Arryn,Tyrell and Martell leads to full-scale war. All while a very ancient evil awakens in the farthest north. Amidst the war and political confusion, a neglected military order of misfits, the Night's Watch, is all that stands between the realms of men and icy horrors beyond. (IMDb)     Critical reception:   Game of Thrones was highly anticipated by fans before its premiere. It has since become a critical and commercial success.

Göran Everdahl for SVT's Gomorron Sverige gave the film 4 out of 5 and described the film as ""kitchen sink fantasy"" that ""gives the vampire story back something it has been missing for a long time: the ability to really frighten us"".

In this flawed, fiercely relevant film, wonders never cease.""

These asteroids also decimated New York soon thereafter. Then, NASA discovered that there is an asteroid roughly the size of Texas heading towards the Earth, and when it does hit the Earth, the planet itself and all of its inhabitants will be obliterated, worse, the asteroid will hit the Earth in 18 days. Unfortunately, NASA's plans to destroy the asteroid are irrelevant. That is when the U.S. military decides to use a nuclear warhead to blow the asteroid to pieces. Then, scientists decide to blow the asteroid with the warhead inside the asteroid itself. The only man to do it, is an oil driller named Harry Stamper and his group of misfit drillers and geologists. As he and his drill team prepare for space excavation, the asteroid is still heading towards the Earth. When the crew are launched into outer space, they are determined to destroy this asteroid. (IMDb)     Critical reception:   Armageddon received mostly mixed reviews from film critics, who mainly took issue with ""the furious pace of its editing"". The film is on the list of Roger Ebert's most hated films. In his original review, Ebert stated, ""The movie is an assault on the eyes, the ears, the brain, common sense and the human desire to be entertained"". Todd McCarthy of Variety also gave the film a negative review, noting Michael Bay's rapid cutting style: ""Much of the confusion, as well as the lack of dramatic rhythm or character development, results directly from Bay's cutting style, which resembles a machine gun stuck in the firing position for 2½ hours.""

Navigating cold, mountainous terrain and cities thousands of years old, Jonathan is on his own spiritual journey to come to terms with his father's accelerating decline and possibly his own fate. As Huntington's widens the gulf between them, 'Father Spirit' invites viewers to rethink conventional notions about the terminally ill and what it means to love someone unconditionally.
