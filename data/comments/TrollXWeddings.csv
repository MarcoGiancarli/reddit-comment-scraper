There was always a reason, but from fittings to bridal showers, she only showed up if the event was completely free (engagement dinner was a no go since she didn't want to pay for her own drinks), or if all the work was done by other people. She went to do the underwear shopping trip with my sister, but ended up bringing her kids and then ditching them with my sister at Fredericks while she went to flirt with some guy in the mall for an hour.  The crowning moment happened at the bachelorette party where she had to borrow money from me because she didn't have any, then got belligerently drunk, and tried multiple times to fight me. My sister ended up asking her to not be in the wedding party, and she didn't even bother going to her wedding.   In case you're feeling sorry for her and thinking that she just may not have a lot of money, don't. She makes good money, does not pay rent or childcare, and went on a week long trip to Vegas the week before the bridal shower, where she showed up and told my sister she didn't have enough money to buy her a gift."

TrollXWeddings,3as5rv,CheckYesJewliet,6,Tue Jun 23 02:02:18 2015 UTC,"I know weddings are stressful. I know that the smallest things can just set you off, and you wonder where the reasonable person you used to be went. This kinda sounds like one of those times, to an outsider. For example: our current anniversary is a month after my birthday, and 6 days after his. We made damn sure that we got married at a time that spaced them out more, because it's stressful to have so many important dates so close to each other. I want to find him awesome presents for his birthday AND our anniversary, but I only have so much creativity! So....they probably weren't trying to imply you were selfish. It's a legitimate concern for many couples, and they might've just wanted to make sure you thought about it. Of course, that's easy for me to say, seeing as I'm not actually part of the situation. It always is, huh? But you're right that yelling probably doesn't set a good precedent for week one of wedding planning. I highly recommend getting someone professional you can talk to about wedding feelings, since it sounds like you've got some strong feelings that wedding planning is quickly bringing to the forefront (as did I, and it did wonders for me!)"

It can be incredibly sucky to have these events on top of each other! ;) Our anniversary is currently 4 days after Valentine's Day, and I was born about 3 weeks before Christmas; he a few weeks after Valentine's day. Our major ""gift giving"" occasions are all crowded together in the winter - and since we hate summer weddings, our wedding is in October! Usually you can plan ahead if you're good at budgeting, but it still stinks to see two gifts' worth of cash leave your bank account at once!  I don't think your mom took it too personally. I've already gone ""bridezilla"" about extremely minor things and the pressure of a wedding gets to most people involved!

TrollXWeddings,3aafow,LadyLisaLionheart,30,Thu Jun 18 14:40:22 2015 UTC,"What the actual fuck.   On the heels of my graduating college with NO job prospects, NO income of my own, and 50K of debt asking to be paid back starting the month of my best friend's wedding, I had to decline being in the wedding party, decline going, and opt not to give them anything but a very hearty congratulations via Skype.   Now, maybe it's different because my best friend was the groom, and he just rolled with it. Maybe he's got some unexpressed resentment. But so far he's had a ""be there with bells on"" attitude about my own wedding.   Seems like you are probably better off without her until she grows the fuck up. You're not responsible for furnishing her home or funding her lifestyle."
TrollXWeddings,3aafow,justheretoweddit,15,Thu Jun 18 15:05:56 2015 UTC,"... This makes me sad for you.  My husband's best friend confessed to him (hella embarrassed) that he couldn't be in the wedding party or maybe even make it.  He and his fiance live paycheck to paycheck and it's hard enough on them just making ends meet.  We paid for everything.  Tux rental, hotel, whatever. I didn't even hesitate - if they're truly a good friend, having financial limitations is something you work around, not make the person pay for emotionally!!  Even if he can never pay us back, his presence and the speech he delivered was worth every penny.   I can't imagine getting married without my best friends present and if money was all that was in the way I'd fix it.  It's not charity, I want my besties there!! (Far more than my crazy aunt or drunk uncle... uhg)"

I will throw myself under the bus and tell you that I don't even know which person gave us what gift- we did our best to track it, but then all of the sudden we were hungover the next morning in our living room, floating the last keg in the kitchen and tearing into boxes, throwing dish towels at each other and giggling like mildly retarded little girls, putting the mixing bowls on our heads as helmets and building tissue paper forts.   It made writing the thank you cards difficult, though… :)"

I love how I have gotten apologies from others about this. Lol. Such sweet peeps on this reddit. I have decided to end the friendship. I can't come back from some of the mean things she said about me. She didn't seem bothered when I ""broke up"" with her so clearly our friendship didn't mean that much. It hurts, but life goes on.

TrollXWeddings,3aafow,jane_margolis,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:21:11 2015 UTC,"I almost had the exact same situation. In the end her parents helped me out (and I repaid them when I finally got a job) but I almost considered ending the friendship because of the ridiculous expectations put on me.   However, even now I have a bit of resentment towards her about it. Especially considering she's now a bridesmaid in my wedding, with 3 children and a stay-at-home mom and the most I've asked her to spend (so far) is $40 on her dress. It's because of her wedding that I've actually tried to keep the costs for my girls down."

I felt bad, but I was in her bridal party and my daughter was the flower girl, I spent $140 on my dress, $110 on my daughter's, and $60 to get my hair done, among other things. I literally couldn't afford it at that point. My gift was showing up and looking pretty. Luckily she understood. I'd say you're better off not having her as a friend."

I have a feeling his mother is facilitating this. She has been increasingly petty as the wedding gets closer.  It surely would not be hard to get a babysitter. He is not a special needs child, he is perfectly average.   There is clearly some line in the sand being drawn here. I just don't know why in the 10 years I've been with my SO his mother feels the need for a power play now."
TrollXWeddings,39w0rf,river_trail,3,Thu Jun 18 19:35:22 2015 UTC,"I have held this theory since I went to a relatives big wedding when I was 9. That weddings are these things that people dream about, fairy tales and all that shit. ""Perfect weddings"" are often considered to be big, expensive and with lots of people (whether or not thats true, personally I don't think it is for everyone) So everyone gets on this power trip. They're searching for some of that wedding magic that disney and american culture has everyone convinced exists. They want to do it their way, and they are convinced it will be PERFECT. It's a mix of jealousy of the happy couple, and being powerhungry/searching for happiness through them. This effect is multiplied when the person is selfish. People show their true colors under stress.   I hope you have an awesome time, and just know that this is about YOU. Congrats!!!!"

You're dredging up memories for me; one bridesmaid who brought her baby and husband to my hens night, and one best man who demanded that his short term girlfriend's two children be allowed to come to our no-kids reception or he wouldn't be able to come.

We had bowls filled with glowsticks bracelets that everyone put on as it got dark. After the reception we just rolled out to whatever local bars we could find in a hilarious glowy rowdy group. Next few days were filled with quality time with our friends and family on sailboats, barbecuing by pools, watching gorgeous sunsets, snorkeling, jet skiing, cocktails, relaxing.

""I can't believe someone would completely disregard the bride and groom's wishes on their wedding day. What selfish and rude people.""

And we're actually able to accommodate all of those within the planned menu. But if it's a matter of personal taste, they can just screw right off."

It's actually relatively easy because my sister is the one with serious allergies, so everything has to be super-double-checked for her to begin with; it's more of a reflex for me to check labels than a chore.  I will have to have someone literally guard the mac and cheese because even though I tell her it's not GF and label it as such, she will otherwise still eat a giant helping and then blame me for all her ills the next day. It happened at our housewarming party a couple years ago."

At my sisters wedding, one of the caterers was in charge of feeding the 4 (or so) of us with celiac's plus the really old people who couldn't   their food. It was great to be comfortable eating whatever and knowing I wouldn't shit my pants the next day. My dad even made a gf wedding cake that was decorated in our house to prevent cross contamination!

Depression isn't new to me by any means and I have made tremendous progress in the past. I've just been going through an exceptionally difficult time lately and been fighting the darkness off but its just completely enveloping me at this point.   Medication seems like my last resort now. I've been on many different types in the past with no success and have been on others that helped amazingly a few years ago. A recent short, poor attempt at taking meds again really wrecked my sex drive and caused a lot more issues than it was worth. With things only just finally beginning to sort themselves back in that regard, I'm even more afraid to bother that route.   I appreciate your kind words, thank you."

TrollXWeddings,36bogs,Delanakatrella,2,Mon May 18 17:41:59 2015 UTC,"Thank you.   I've come across and read these comics before, neither resonated too much with me. I find the first half of both relatable but not the endings. I've heard spoken poems and read other metaphors that helped describe my own experiences better. It is reassuring knowing I'm not alone. Sometimes it helps me feel a little less alone, but not much. I'm just terrified one day it'll all be too much for my fiancé to bother with anymore and I'm even more terrified of believing him when he says that will never happen."
TrollXWeddings,36bogs,Delanakatrella,6,Mon May 18 18:47:43 2015 UTC,"My fiance and I actually put off our wedding by an extra 6 months so both of us could go into therapy and make sure we're both as OK as possible mentally before we started planning the wedding.  Having that extra 6 months to plan really helped me a TON (Depression complicated by Anxiety), and made him feel much more comfortable as well.    It sounds like you're in a good boat - therapy and looking at medication.  But remember that if you're making a commitment to your FH, whether you say the words officially on your currently planned date, or 6 months to a year later, that commitment is still there even without the wedding.  If you need to take a little extra time to space out your planning then take the time.  Your mental health is super important.  If you're really locked down on your date, can you ask your FH to take over some of the details?"
TrollXWeddings,36bogs,Delanakatrella,2,Mon May 18 05:03:04 2015 UTC,"I took this and other reasons I didn't want to rush into consideration when we picked our date, 10/15/16 so we still have quite some time. Our only real task so far as been beginning to look at venues so we could secure the venture and date and worry about the rest more towards 2016 but so far this one task has been trying to say the least. But of course it is, right now getting out of bed is hard, keeping from crying at my desk at work is hard, cooking dinner is hard.   I'd hate to push the date or this bit of planning off too much just because I'm having such a hard time but the last few weekends we've had plans to look at venues, my depression and anxiety take over and we end up having to reschedule."
TrollXWeddings,36bogs,MistressMaryBoleyn,1 point,Mon May 18 13:02:55 2015 UTC,"You have so much time!  Mine is May of 2016.  I think with that big of a window you could probably afford to take a month and really focus on you and your health.  Maybe spend a few hours together each weekend writing down exactly what you want in a venue, so when you dive into the hunt it can be an easy checklist instead of a mental challenge to decide if where you're touring fits the bill.  If you have a really good checklist maybe you could send FH with the checklist and have him ask the questions and take photos if you don't feel up to going with him.    Hugs I was exactly where you are now about 4 months ago and I really feel you.  It will get better, especially as it sounds like you are working on getting better through therapy.  I really think the hardest part for me was finding medications that worked for me - I spent the better part of the last year with 3 months here and 4 months there of different meds trying to give each one time to really reach full effectiveness to evaluate how well it was working.  Easily the worst year of my life.  Just remember how lucky you are to have a great fiance who can support you and make things easier!"
TrollXWeddings,36bogs,casualcolloquialism,2,Mon May 18 15:51:30 2015 UTC,"I'm sure I could take a month, but how I see it is, is a month really going to make a difference? These last few months seemed to have flown by and i can't see one more changing things. My fiance and I got engaged a week before Christmas and moved in together in February into my dad's house - from which he'd just retired and moved to Florida from here in NY and that's sort of my biggest issue to deal with right now. I'm the epitome of a daddy's girl and entering this new stage of my life, engagement, without him here is really weighing on me.   Fiancé and I have been figuring out what we want in a venue through this process so far. I think we've narrowed down a checklist I could write out clearly. I don't think he'd be willing to visit one without me, but I'm grateful he's understanding enough to allow me to cancel if I'm not feeling up to going.   I find wedding planning over all to be just so far away from what I m capable right now. Its planning a party with pictures and people and to be honest, those aren't things I like, at least not now. I have so far to go within myself mentally and physically (I've got a good 40 lbs to drop before this) that I just cannot see it ever happening. My fiancé is so excited about it all and the idea of seeing me in the dress and the whole shebang and I'm just... Not there. I don't know how else to put it and its dragging me down.   HUGS Thanks. I think the hardest part will be finding a medication/med combo that helps. Now that I just turned 26 last month and have finally been kicked off my dads amazing health insurance and now have to use the shitty one provided by my job, its another concern. I'm not sure how the prices will be now and it doesn't help with the idea of going into a prolonged trial and error period.   You're very right, I am completely lucky to have such an amazingly supportive fiancé, I'd be so lost without him in all this"
TrollXWeddings,36bogs,KashiMaeve,1 point,Mon May 18 17:08:05 2015 UTC,"A month of really focusing on you each weekend, focusing on just relaxing and not allowing yourself to worry, will probably help more than you expect it will.  It sounds like you've had a bunch of sudden changes and I know with my anxiety it can really mess me up to feel like I'm constantly trying to get my legs underneath me.  Take a month to tackle the day-to-day chaos, focus on the weekends on relaxing, and plan a few fun but low cost dates with your FH.    There are TONS of meds out there that are generics now.  I pay less than $14 a month for my Welbutrin generic, and was under $4 a month for the Prozac generic.  Depending on what area you're in you might find there are some really good local programs designed for low-income mental care.  The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline actually does keep lists of these on hand, and you don't have to be in a crisis to call them for resources.  If you're not comfortable calling (because with my anxiety I'm always like ""fuck this whole calling people thing!"") they actually have an online chat available through their website as well.  See what resources they can point you toward to affording your care, I bet they have at least a few.  And I can say if you ever want to PM just to talk, I'd be more than happy to be your online buddy!"

He's also starting a campaign to run for town council as well as talking about starting up a business, on top of his full time job. I'm trying to handle learning how to take care of a whole house for the first time. Wedding business seems so far off :( We've been trying to do a date night a week but that was rocky at best and has sort of fallen off, I keep getting too depressed or anxious or angry or whatever the emotion may be.   Generics will probably have to come in and save me price wise. My changing health insurance situation has been weighing on me a lot and really causing me go rethink any doctor visit I think I may need. I make too much to be considered low income though. Ultimately I'm sure I'm just finding reasons not to take action, I'll have to turn that around. You are spot on with the making phone calls thing though, that's always been a huge weakness of mine.  I'd like that!"

Best thing is to try to calmly sit down and talk to them about your feelings regarding venues, etc. also, if it gets too bad, please try to see somebody and talk it out and maybe, if needed, a little medication. I'm on 2 different kinds (SSRI and Abilify) with a small wedding and I sometimes get frazzled. Just breathe...."

He also had a separate ""work phone"" that she wasn't allowed to touch/look at. He literally had a double life. But I mean, why the heck would a salesperson (not even manager/supervisor) of The Source need to fly in and fly out for work?  For those who don't know what The Source is.

I'm not currently on BC to where I could manipulate it (i.e. skip over the sugar pill week) but I hope to be getting an IUD soon.

Did someone already buy and mail you something, as soon as you launched your site/registry, and the wedding's still six or more months away? Email or call them shortly after you get the gift, acknowledge it and let them know you're excited to see them as the wedding -- reiterate your gratitude with a mailed thank you card after the wedding, as you would with any guest. You don't need to send a card NOW, but you can't let them hanging and wondering if their present even arrived!  If your wedding's only like a month away but people are starting to have stuff just sent to your house, then it's fine to maybe thank them when you see them at the receiving line -- ""Thank you so much for coming! I also wanna thank you for the [mention gift], it arrived a few [weeks/days] ago and we loved it!"" Again, reiterate with a card after the party."

TrollXWeddings,33cyip,adibidibadibi,4,Tue Apr 21 20:04:47 2015 UTC,I don't think any wedding no matter how big or small or where will stress free. My best friend just got married after two weeks of being engaged thinking it would be stress free doing it at the local court house. We're Scottish and her husband is American so quickness was for visa purposes. Yeah it turned out to be more stress than she ever thought with trying to keep it small and simple from his parents trying to make it bigger.

TrollXWeddings,333j6q,waikiki_sneaky,13,Sun Apr 19 06:02:28 2015 UTC,"Bring one or two people with you (not a herd of people, lots of differing opinions can get confusing and overwhelming quickly) who will give you their honest yet tactful opinion of dresses. It might look awesome from the front, but the back could be no good and you need someone that will say ""pure white washes you out, let's try ivory"". It's important that you can stay focused and excited and open minded, and the friends/family you choose should be there to help ensure that you don't get too stressed or flustered in the busyness of it all.   Have an idea of what you want, but do try on a dress in every one of the basic shapes to get an idea of what shape is most flattering on you. I didn't think a trumpet style would look good at all on me, but it turns out it's my favourite shape on me! Many brides go in thinking they know what they want and walk out happily with something entirely different than they envisioned.  Don't get discouraged if you don't have an ""Aha!"" moment. You don't have to find the perfect dress on your first trip, and not all women experience an ""Aha!"" and a flood of emotion when they pick their dress. Don't feel disheartened if you choose a dress that you think looks wonderful but doesn't make you want to cry (that's your partners job when s/he sees you walking down the aisle ;) ).    Lastly, alterations can work miracles sometimes. Like everything but the button-up back? You can change that. Don't like the sweetheart neckline? You can change that. Think it's too poofy or flat? You can change that. Too long? You can change that. When trying on dresses, try to envision the finished product on you - the way the dress will look when it's not clipped in back and too long and the bust is too tight. They can't stock dresses for every body that exists, and that's why alterations exist - to make the dress you pick fit your body perfectly.     Last lastly: Have fun! You are (hopefully) marrying the person that will stand by your side and make you happy until the end. Your dress will be beautiful, and so will you, and so will your wedding. Best of luck, and congratulations!"

TrollXWeddings,333j6q,Ravanys,10,Mon Apr 20 22:08:29 2015 UTC,"Try on a dress of every style, even ones you don't think you will like. Try on a variety of fabrics.   I was set on a vintage lace style. Like this.  http://sangmaestro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/elegant-vintage-lace-wedding-dresses.jpg  Every single one I tried on was so...wrong and I felt plain.

So try on all kinds of styles and if it you aren't finding the  one, step out of what you think you want and try on the complete opposite!"

TrollXWeddings,333j6q,maybebabyg,10,Sun Apr 19 13:05:46 2015 UTC,"Wear deodorant- both under your pits and if you're busty, do your underboob too. Or use talc for your underboob.  Wear a strapless bra if possible. If not, freeballing is an option, just wear some nipple tape for modesty.  If they offer you a veil, try it. Even if you didn't want one to begin with. Seeing my dress teamed with a veil resulted in me changing my mind from tiara to veil. (If you go with a ballgown or A-line your best veils are elbow length, mermaid dresses pair well with fingertip length. Very short and very long veils work with most dresses.)  Check reviews before you go in. Bonus points if you can get reviews from people you know. And trust your instincts, if something seems off, leave.   Always say your wedding is at least two weeks before it actually is, that way if there's some kind of delay you should still be fine or have time to find a new dress."
TrollXWeddings,333j6q,maybebabyg,2,Sun Apr 19 07:26:22 2015 UTC,"Oh, man I haven't even THOUGHT about veils.  that seems so... complicated.   good call on pretending the wedding is earlier than it is!"
TrollXWeddings,333j6q,Go_Bias,3,Mon Apr 20 22:11:11 2015 UTC,"It's really not that complicated, it just balances out the dress nicer if the veil ends where the skirt flares out.  A friend got married last year and her dress store had to get her dress made and ordered in from China. It turns out the store was in some serious debt with the makers and they were refusing to ship the dresses on order until they were paid in full. They ended up getting the dresses three days before the wedding, no time for alterations other than hemlines, they stuffed the maid of honour's dress completely, so she had to go buy an entirely new dress from a different store."

Shoes that are roughly the height that you'll be wearing day of. I'd recommend low heels if any. There won't be as much dress to trip over if you switch to sandals on wedding night.   Looks like some other trolls recommended not bringing a big crowd shopping with you and trying on lots of styles. Great advice. (I was ""set on A line but it made me look terrible)  Get dolled up!

TrollXWeddings,32ww8z,rainbowraven,3,Tue May 5 01:13:00 2015 UTC,"I would look for either a vineyard with a wine tasting dinner and/or a wine and jazz club. With both venues, you can look online to find a great one well in advance, then call them (again well in advance) and tell them that you want to host a classy hens night there.   Most places will love the business and be willing to work with you. If you have enough people or the right timing to schedule a chunk of it (either by space or time) for just you guys, you can probably get them to do a little bit in the way of decorations and the like. That will probably cost you a bit more money, but you could make the decorations yourself (or with the help of the other maids) and just give them to the venue to set up.   Also, if you really want a classy deal, make sure you mention that to the venue, when you're looking for a more upscale place. They don't want that penis and tiara nonsense in there any more than you do."
