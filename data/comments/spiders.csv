So, while I'm significantly creeped out and uneasy doing so, I looked up the ID you gave and everything I looked at seemed to indicate you were correct in your guess/statement.  And while I really don't like being creeped out, this was good, because now I'm not as creeped out and should I ever cross paths with one of these guys I'll be far less creeped out and maybe even be curious enough to get pictures.

I had left my pack of cigarettes out on the patio table for a little over an hour, decided it was time to feed the nicotine demon while watching YouTube on my phone. Grabbed the pack without really looking at it (focused on YouTube), sat down, pulled a cigarette out, put it in my mouth, and went to light it. If you're a smoker this is the part you know you need to look at, to make sure the flame hits the cigarette, the rest is automatic.  Well, I looked down at the end of the cigarette (already in my mouth) and this little fucker is staring right at me. Luckily I don't have a phobia or any disproportionate amount of fear towards them, but it still most definitely shocked me. I took the cigarette out and tried my best to get a decently focused pic of it with my phone since I've never seen a spider like this.  Several times it would start to head to the opposite end of the cigarette (where my fingers were) and I'd drop the cigarette on the table to grab the opposite end (phone in other hand, only way I could think of to not let it near me, especially since I have no idea wtf it is or if it's deadly etc).  This is the best pic I got before it came for my finger a third time and me dropping the cigarette crushed him (RIP spiderbro). A drop from about 2 inches pinned it between the weight of my cigarette and a glass top table actually killed it... Spiders have survived me stomping on them in the past so this really surprised/saddened me.  I just want to know what type of spider it was though.  If more pics are needed, it's dead curled up body is still here and I can try to take more pics if needed.  Please ask for more info/pics.  x-posted to /r/whatisthisthing  Edit: spider is not dead.

Some people are bad enough that spider handling is necessary or desirable to expedite recovery.  If you have the urge or instruction to handle a spider then jumping spiders work well.  They're small; you can barely feel them.  You don't even have to pick them up - just get close, take their picture, and there's a good chance they'll jump on you.

When the camera pans down to where it fell, it shows a tight clump of spiders scatter. Also, when it shows masses of spiders crawling on the wall, they seem to be large spiders with bodies at least the size of a quarter, but when they get in for a close up, the bodies are suddenly about the size of a dime.
