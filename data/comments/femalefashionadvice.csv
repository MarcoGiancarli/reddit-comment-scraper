femalefashionadvice,3e31py,yeah_iloveit,29,Tue Jul 21 19:48:52 2015 UTC,"This weekend I did KonMari on my entire wardrobe, including shoes, outerwear, PJs etc. It was emotionally intense. Before I started I would have told you that I don’t keep a lot of stuff I don’t really like or need. Turns out that is a gigantic lie.   I think the most important part of KonMari is thinking about the relationship you have with your stuff. Holding each item in my hands and saying “how do I feel about this?” was actually pretty important. I had a ton of emotions tied up with my clothing, good and bad. Confronting my emotions about my clothing helped me get rid of stuff I would have told you last week I’d never get rid of. It’s obvious to most of us that hoarding is about emotional issues, but on a non-clinical level too, most of us have some emotional issues wrapped up in our stuff.  By far my biggest mistake had been keeping out of season clothes in storage. This led to an out of sight, out of mind problem that made it easy to think I only ever had half the amount of clothing I actually had. Now almost everything is in my closet, except for a few winter items that are too bulky for year-round inclusion.  Looking at my house through KonMari eyes, it’s an exhausting mess of emotions. I’m so glad that I’ve started this.  Tl;dr if you are in a really emotional place right now, it’s either a really great time to attempt KonMari, or it’s really not."
femalefashionadvice,3e31py,jemisoutrageous,6,Tue Jul 21 16:07:34 2015 UTC,"Good for you doing your wardrobe all at once! You have it right about it being totally exhausting. I have been tackling things in small batches, like a four-foot counter on my kitchen today, that kind of thing. Otherwise, it's just too much.  That said, the feeling after is nice, and it definitely stays with you and affects what you accept into your space, whether through purchase, gift, etc."
femalefashionadvice,3e31py,yeah_iloveit,14,Tue Jul 21 16:18:55 2015 UTC,"I think her approach of doing it all by category instead of by space is so crucial. I started on Friday night and finished up Sunday night. I had to do it in batches of a couple of hours because I have a toddler. I found that my desire to go back and finish decreased a little more each time I took a break, so I forced myself to keep going. Otherwise I'd be doing what I did every year before now and never finishing. But now I'm wondering if I was influenced too much by exhaustion...no, do not go through the trash bags. Do not open.  I still haven't tackled tights because I forgot about them. They're all too small anyway. Okay, tights are done."
femalefashionadvice,3e31py,hangonlittletomato,3,Tue Jul 21 16:22:07 2015 UTC,"Exhaustion is key to helping me get rid of clothes. I'm able to forget about any sentimental attachments or any ""Well I could wear it one day..."" thoughts. This happened this weekend and I took a huge bag to Value Village."
femalefashionadvice,3e31py,ilikepai,4,Tue Jul 21 16:56:53 2015 UTC,"I feel like I definitely need to KonMari my apt. I started this weekend with a baby step - folding my shirts so they ""stand up"" in my drawer. WTF though, are all her shirts cotton tees? I could not get 90% of my shirts to stand up on their own and I doubt she can get her blouses to do it either!"
femalefashionadvice,3e31py,purplenat,6,Tue Jul 21 16:27:00 2015 UTC,"I know she's kind of anti hanging, but I hang pretty much anything that's woven, and only fold knits, pants, and lounge stuff - which itself is basically all knit. Blouses are all hung.    I'm also a bit of an organization fanatic, and won't be taking any of her advice on how to organize my closet unless it's something I already do. The heavy on the left, light on the right thing she talks about sounds completely crazy to me. The rainbow effect of sorting by colour brings me joy, so I will not be parting with it! :-)    I am really excited to try her take-everything-out advice, though. I bought a proper dresser, and it arrives on Thursday. Friday will be assemble dresser + KonMari my closet day. I am so excited. :-D"
femalefashionadvice,3e31py,yeah_iloveit,4,Tue Jul 21 16:40:32 2015 UTC,"It is so exciting, but also terrifying, to see just how much you own when it's all in front of you. I thought, how do I have so much stuff? And you feel as though you own so much less. Now that I have so much less I feel as though I have much more, probably because I'm aware of every single item.   And I didn't focus too much on details either, like this on the left and this on the right, bla bla. What I liked about the book is that there was a mixture of holistic advice and specific advice: I went for more of the emotional work and less of the nuts and bolts folding and organizing work.   I think it can still be a really effective method without following all the details, and imo the emotional work is really the crux of it. She's right that most other storage methods are just about finding new places to shove all your crap without actually facing what you own."
femalefashionadvice,3e31py,purplenat,3,Tue Jul 21 17:26:28 2015 UTC,"I agree. I just love the idea of confronting yourself with reality as motivation for change. I think the visual pile of stuff, and the sensory act of individually holding each item sounds key to coming to grips with the volume of stuff in your home. That seems like the central message.    I've been getting excited about the process, and my husband caught the bug before I even started. Except, he hasn't read the book, or really grasped the central component. He's like, OK, I'm gonna do books. I plan on doing one shelf each day. And I was like NOOO! That is the opposite of the point! I've gotta do that lead-by-example thing she talks about except that I am a procrastinator and he is a get-it-done-yesterday type, so he started before me!"
femalefashionadvice,3e31py,yeah_iloveit,4,Tue Jul 21 18:06:41 2015 UTC,"I just folded my pants and sweaters and stacked them next to each other instead of on top of each other as she recommends, and I put them in little cloth boxes because I don't have any drawers. They keep themselves in place by pressing against each other. Beyond that, I don't bother with folding stuff. My socks will stay balled up for life and my underwear forever unfolded. I never stick to folding for very long."
femalefashionadvice,3e31py,ilikepai,2,Tue Jul 21 16:29:48 2015 UTC,"I thought she did mean next to each other? My tops do stay folded because they're pressed together, but I don't like that once I remove a few to wear, the whole system starts collapsing. I'm really anal about my closet and I loved perfectly folded clothing with sharp corners, so tops sliding around in my drawers stresses me out! But the traditional fold-and-stack like in retail does take up more space!"
femalefashionadvice,3e31py,yeah_iloveit,2,Tue Jul 21 16:36:07 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I worded that badly. I meant that she recommends storing them next to each other instead of on top of each other :) I'm also worrying about collapsing the system, especially with pants, which I'm lazing about putting back (I fold jeggings and yoga pants and hang my dress pants). We'll see how it goes..."
femalefashionadvice,3e31py,purplenat,2,Tue Jul 21 16:52:42 2015 UTC,"Here's my solution. I have no pictures, but if I don't make any sense, and you want pictures, let me know.    Tshirts in my drawer are in two rows, left to right, one row behind the other. I can open my drawer all the way to easily see both rows. I have a ""drawer divider"" (um, a piece of cardboard taped to the plastic drawer) that goes both up-down and left-right, creating 4 quadrants. That means that each section has 8 to 10 Tshirts in it, so that even if I take out 3 or 4 in a single quadrant, there is still a lot of structure around so keep the Tshirts in place, and even if one quadrant falls apart, the others stay up."
femalefashionadvice,3e31py,niftynonsense,4,Tue Jul 21 18:23:13 2015 UTC,"I need to get on board with this ASAP, I have way too much stuff that I've just been moving from place to place over the years without much thought."
femalefashionadvice,3e31py,funobtainium,3,Tue Jul 21 17:24:47 2015 UTC,"I thought it was very useful to think in terms of ""does this item give me joy?"" and to toss it if it doesn't.  That seemed to work for me when the rotation stuff and other methods didn't."
femalefashionadvice,3e31py,purplenat,4,Tue Jul 21 19:28:40 2015 UTC,"Yes, I like the positive nature of keeping what you love instead of a more negative throwing things away focus."
femalefashionadvice,3e31py,sarah-ah-um,4,Tue Jul 21 19:43:01 2015 UTC,"I am reading the book now and looking forward to doing it. I can see how it would be life changing for sure, and I want to change my life!"
femalefashionadvice,3e31py,ruthannr94,3,Tue Jul 21 16:42:02 2015 UTC,"I really need to look into KonMari.  It's not something I have experience with, but too much stuff in my life is causing a lot of emotional exhaustion these days and I need to deal with it."

I didn't get my dream job because they wanted someone with more experience managing a team of direct reports, which I haven't done. But all the jobs where you manage people (at least, in my company) require you to have that experience. So, you can't get the job without the experience but you can't get the experience without the job. So frustrating."

He'll do everything ahead of time, plan thing, be all ready, and I'm on reddit talking about jeans. We both still get things done, we just have different approaches. If he's still getting things done, then you just have two different styles/approaches. If however, on move-day, he's still unpacked, that's a different story."

I was planning on applying at a company I interned at last summer, but heard through a friend who used to work there that they just laid off like 90 people. Would it still be a good idea to send in a resume and a cover letter that's like ""hey I loved interning with you guys, I just graduated and I'm looking for full time work so please keep me in mind for positions or freelancing :D :D :D""?

I absolutely love wearing jeans and find it so easy to pair with things so not being able to wear these 5/7 days a week is just tough.

I'm slowly adapting though, and the best options I've found have been skirts and dresses that are appropriate but still loose and comfortable.    Whenever I get off work though, you can bet that I'm instantly transitioning into tank tops, jeans, and all my other comfy stuff I can't wear for work."

Taking off your work clothes to put on your favorite home/casual clothes feels soooooooo good. It also helps to switch your mind from work to relaxation (or in my case, from ""Cubicle Rat"" to ""Mom Extraordinaire:)."

I want to get everything right right away, and that's just not possible, especially as I'm still working out my personal style. And I am mourning my youth, because between my smaller size and more youthful features, I was able to put together fabulous looks without much effort. Now I have to deal not just with the fun stuff like color and pattern and silhouette, but with bumps and lumps and all that fun, middle-aged stuff. So my confidence level is pretty low.

When I was younger I would socialize a lot more and I'd come home with my head reeling and buzzing and I couldn't sleep and I thought that was pretty normal.   Then one day I thought fuck it, I'm not going out, and I experienced the recharging power of time alone. Now I hate that reeling buzzing feeling and I avoid it by keeping to one on one interactions, and socializing much less. My friends either adapted or disappeared. But fewer friends is easier to handle!"

The best part is having friends that understand that and don't have an incessant need to do everything together and always be talking and texting.    The bonus is that since I've moved recently, I've really discovered the friends that I am closest with, and I'm much happier interacting with a few very good friends rather than a ton of acquaintances."
femalefashionadvice,3e31py,wakeupmargaret,2,Tue Jul 21 16:44:19 2015 UTC,"oddly enough, i really don't think i'm an introvert. i would much rather hang out with someone, even if we are doing nothing. being alone too much really gets to me in a bad way, so this is a weird experience for me. it has definitely been nice to recharge though."
femalefashionadvice,3e31py,yeah_iloveit,4,Tue Jul 21 16:55:11 2015 UTC,"Introverts love people and socializing! They just tend to prefer smaller groups, on fewer occasions, and they don't need constant interaction: they need down time to recharge or they feel totally drained. They also prefer things like public speaking or teaching over small talk or hosting parties. It's all about what drains you and what energizes you.   This still might not be what you're like, but I just thought I'd try to clear up any confusion."

femalefashionadvice,3e31py,yeah_iloveit,4,Tue Jul 21 17:43:42 2015 UTC,"It helped me understand why I found school so hard sometimes. Her central premise is that western culture is based rewarding the extrovert - in the home, at school, at work, at play. We value employees who talk the loudest and the most, and we grade students on participation and force them into group work. Our most typical socializing activities are things like going to bars, clubs or restaurants, not going hiking or to museums (though this is changing hugely with our generation imo). If you're a parent, you're supposed to help with sports teams or school events or host parties...anything that involves a ton of other people.   I think my daughter will be an extrovert as she gets older, so I have a lot to learn!"

It seems like a lot of people here want to settle down and start families.  Relationships and children horrify me.  I'm also finding this place really boring - everything closes at 9, and I'm also unhappy with how much I'm being paid.  I guess the question is, how do you put this politely when interviewers ask why you want to switch jobs?"
femalefashionadvice,3e31py,lgbtqbbq,5,Tue Jul 21 17:52:54 2015 UTC,"Well I definitely would stay away from saying you hate things or they are horrifying to you :) Generally no good to use those words in an interview.  I think there are a lot of honest but kind-sounding ways to talk about switching jobs. It's ALWAYS better to talk about why the prospective employer would be AWESOME, not just why your old employer is NOT awesome. Because when you say, ""Oh my boss sucks,"" or ""There's no room for growth,"" even if it's 100% true, the interviewer will hear ""I have a bad attitude, and I don't try hard.""  Re-frame the question and say you love the way the new company is structured, either because of the team environment or the opportunity to tackle individual projects and have even more responsibility. Or say the culture at New Company is energizing to you. Talk about the specific subject matter the New Company deals with and why it fascinates you in particular. Reference old experiences and why they make you want to work at New Company.  What sounds better, saying ""Nobody at Old Job listens to my feedback!"" or ""From what your employees have said, New Company seems to really value team feedback and use it to grow and improve.""? Complimenting the new company is always better than shitting on the old company, and will not be seen as evasive. It's implied that when you say you love X about new company, you are finding it lacking at your old employer. But it's better to leave that unspoken. If you have an aggressive interviewer who wants to be snarky and push you to say something about your old employer, you can be more frank/direct but still frame it in a way where you are not sounding whiny :)"
femalefashionadvice,3e31py,nayapapaya,6,Tue Jul 21 18:27:53 2015 UTC,"You want a challenge, and you're ready for new opportunities, a new environment and different responsibilities.   It's perfectly fine to want to go somewhere where you feel more socially fulfilled. I really love my current work environment (it's super relaxed and my boss is SUPER nice) but I'm moving to a new job/country soon because my social/personal growth opportunities there are going to be totally different and I will just have more opportunities to do things that I can't do here there. If you feel unhappy and stifled outside of work, then it will eventually affect that too."
femalefashionadvice,3e31py,catterfly,2,Tue Jul 21 18:26:09 2015 UTC,Idk if you talk about that - discuss looking for a job that's a change from what you have going on. You're ready for something new and a different challenge etc

It's an afternoon/evening wedding and it's my fiance's best friend getting married. I've met the bride once and the groom 2-3 times now haha. I already asked the bride (since the invitation didn't specify) what kind of clothing will be worn and she said she really didn't care but the bridesmaids would not be in ankle length dresses so not overly formal.  I prefer a lot of 40s and 50s style clothes, but especially dresses. Thing is it's been a few years since I've been to a wedding and I can't remember what people wear to them. I found these 2 dresses and fell in love:  https://www.etsy.com/listing/151822260/alluring-intricacy-50s-inspired-ball[1]  https://www.etsy.com/listing/237614612/50s-style-v-neck-dress-light-sky-blue[2]  But I have the feeling that red dress is too much for a wedding. (even though it is to die for, love the bust!) But what about the blue one? Just as an aside about me, I rarely ever show my legs. I never swim or wear shorts, I'm always in jeans, and if I do wear dresses, they usually aren't much shorter than just above the knee. I just really need help here ladies because I'm really not overly girly. Thoughts on these dresses? Or if they really don't work does anyone have ideas that could point me in the right direction for my style? Thanks yall!"
femalefashionadvice,3e31py,kbol,3,Tue Jul 21 17:22:45 2015 UTC,"I agree that the red is too much. It's the color and the neckline and a lot of details that push it to a costume-y feel for me. The blue one looks like it would be great, though!"

(I'd provide the link but I don't know if linking to fb is kosher?)   From the photos, it looks like a lot of 20s-30s DC ladies and gents hamming it up at a fun glitzy event. Most of the dresses are knee length, I see a lot of subtle lace detail and sweetheart cuts... most DC girls have a couple of ""go to"" cocktail dresses in the closet to pull out for events like this. I have a feeling that something you already own will work fine.  What I'd wear: a dress that does most of the talking for itself (that is, something with an interesting cut that doesn't require statement jewelry to jazz it up). Something sleeveless or with cap sleeves is ok, and since it's late summer, feel free to go with something white, pastel, or brighter colored. I feel that deep reds and true greens are a little too ""winter"" for the season. As far as material goes, stay away from jersey (way too informal), but cotton can be okay if the cut of the dress is very clean or formal.  I'm curious to see what you've got and I'll definitely weigh in when you update your post!"

The fact that they specify strong cocktail tells me that the event may call for a nicer cocktail dress, so don't worry as much about finding something too summer-y. Since it's also in a major city with possible government officials attending (I'm assuming), it's better to dress up more. Maybe a nice sheath dress in a brighter color? (Not black or navy). Again, it depends on what you already have in your closet. Brightening up a dress with colorful accessories is an option as well."

If you shop at the right places, you can get a gorgeous vintage dress for much less than a modern cocktail dress of the same quality. When I lived in DC, the best reasonably-priced vintage shop was Polly Sue's in Takoma Park (but I moved several years ago, so their selection and prices may have changed). You could also skip buying a new dress, wear something simple, and do your hair and makeup in vintage style. Youtube tutorials are your friend. :) That alone is eye-catching and fun enough to make up for a less-summery dress."

I spent about $90 for a pair of mayari Birks. Had a break in period of 5-7 days, and now they are the most comfortable and supportive shoes I have outside of my tennis shoes (which have orthotics!). So for me they have definitely been worth it; my feet feel so much better in those. I say get them if you'd like, I think you may end up wearing them more than you think.     Edit: I've hear Birkenstock has a spin-off company, Betula, whose sandals are cheaper but still have decent support. Maybe other ladies could chime in if they've tried this brand."

The very cheapest compliant computer pushes 3K, even with a student discount. This will be the single most expensive item that I own. Like, I'm getting renter's insurance entirely thanks to this damn computer. To top it all off, we're expected to carry it back and forth to campus each day.  So I need a bag or backpack. I'd prefer for it not to scream LAPTOP BAG! EXPENSIVE SHIT WITHIN! I live in a city that I love, but it does have a relatively high crime rate and I want to avoid attracting the wrong kind of attention. Ideally, I'd carry a very plain, unbranded, solid colored (navy, black, brown), leather tote. However, I need this bag to be very utilitarian-- sturdy, waterPROOF, zipped at the top, with a few compartments that can hold books and other school supplies. I'd consider a backpack, but my style trends more formal, so Herschel bags or whatnot might look a bit weird. I don't really like a lot of hardware or print on bags. It needs to be a versatile color. The laptop I'm chiefly considering is 15.6 inches and 4.4 lbs.  I'm willing to spend up to $250, maaybe $300 on the perfect bag to safeguard this sonuvabitch, but the cheaper the better since I'll soon be making negative money. To put the personal magnitude (and agony) of this purchase into perspective: I thrift almost everything I wear and have not spent more than $75 on any pair of shoes, bag, or item of clothing for at least 3 years. Any suggestions?"
femalefashionadvice,3e164r,mokoroko,10,Tue Jul 21 07:32:51 2015 UTC,"I just want to say from personal experience that you won't regret renter's insurance if you do have a break-in... or if you live in an apartment complex and other people can light their kitchens on fire...  I've always found it to be very cheap for the coverage that you get.  You can also pay a little extra to get coverage for the original prices of your things, vs. the current market price, which is a-mazing for replacing a stolen computer.  ETA: You can probably find a waterproof sleeve for your laptop, which would give you more options for the bag itself."
femalefashionadvice,3e164r,vouloir-saisir,6,Tue Jul 21 13:47:37 2015 UTC,"Without knowing the size of your laptop, I'd recommend something from Lo & Sons like the OMG. It's a stylish-yet-boring bag, especially once you remove the medallion. The nylon is water-resistant (not waterproof, but let's hope ya have an umbrella) and light. Lots of pockets for organizing. It goes on sale often too -- I nabbed mine for 30% off. I have it in the army green color, and I've taken it to grad seminars, conferences, departmental meetings, and on various flights as a personal item. Other brands to look into are Knomo and Tumi. They tend to strike a good balance between low-key style and function when it comes to laptop totes."

They're really easy to clean too-which was great for me when I inevitably spill coffee everywhere every few months. My only real complaint is that they don't have any internal compartments, but I have a few small bags/pouches that I use to help organize things within my bag."

They don't scream ""I HAVE EXPENSIVE ELECTRONICS IN HERE"" and have nice compartments, so your expensive laptop won't be flopping around everywhere.   However, if you tend to thrift everything you wear, definitely check out some thrift shops/ebay and see if you can find a deal, since you will be spending a big chunk of change on your laptop. With canvas bags, look for something with a really sturdy construction, a heavy canvas,  and sturdy stitching, otherwise your laptop will probably rip through that bag like nothing. I've had that happen before. Looking for something specifically made to carry a laptop will help with that.   EDIT: If you do go with a Longchamp, definitely get an organizational insert, otherwise your shit will just flop all over the place."

Between big boobs and big hips most 'formal' cut sundresses look frumpy on me (not to mention the extreme heat and humidity make them impractical). At the same time the lighter styles that I love to live in can look very casual or unintentionally 'sexy'.    Any suggestions of styles would be super helpful! Fit and flare or anything that hugs the ribcage/is fitted at the waist tends to look best, except jumpsuits which give me horrible front butt. I need a drapey/strappy neckline that shows my collarbone/the outline of my shoulders, otherwise the combination of broad (but slim) shoulders and a large bust creates a sea of material. :/   I know this seems frustratingly picky, but that's why I need a hand!

They can verge on being sexy though, but if you wear a camisole underneath I personally think it's fine. I couldn't find a good example, but something like this or this, only shorter and with a camisole worn underneath can look sophisticated.  A more fitted maxi dress (like this can also look good if you accessorize well and wear nice flats or heels.   I think that a fabric can help making something look more sophisticated, so I'd go a 'heavier'/lined sundress, if you can find any."

I know the shoulder pads are too thick and extend too far, and it needs some adjustment at the waist - the latter is tricky since I'm almost 8 months pregnant. But I know there's more that's... off. I want to focus on everything but the waistline, where possible, simply because any changes now will be invalid in about 2 months after #2 is here.  Here's an album of some shots I just took in the office. We're going into the tailors in about 30 hours, so I'm hoping I can get some comments on it and words that explain what I /know/ is not right, but can't quite put a finger on explaining.

femalefashionadvice,3e164r,serenissima_regina,23,Tue Jul 21 05:53:07 2015 UTC,"It's nearly impossible to tailor shoulders if they are off. If it doesn't it there, then it's probably never going to fit you.  Also the armholes are too big, and the sleeves are too baggy. The torso is too small and shaped wrongly for you - there's pulling in the fabric, and extra bags of fabric.  Honestly, you should ask for your money back. This jacket is almost certainly un-fixable. This ""bespoke"" suit fits you worse than something off-the-rack, and I wouldn't spend more time (or worse) money dealing with it.  If you're looking for off the rack jackets for curvy shapes, Pepperberry has a bunch. There's also a number of brands that run on the curvy side, like Limited or Land's End."

In general, when buying jackets you choose something where the shoulder fits, the armholes fit, and and where the torso is big enough to accommodate you (doesn't necessarily have to fit). Taking in the arms, waist, and back are trivial, and don't affect how the item hangs."

I can't give them my best-beloved suit jacket that /does/ fit (or did fit... stupid pregnancy boob changes) to clone.

femalefashionadvice,3e164r,serenissima_regina,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:52:38 2015 UTC,"IMHO, mens' tailors sometimes tend to struggle with women's jackets from scratch. If anything I see them applying the "" middle-aged men's jacket formula"" - wide shoulders, large armhole, little boob fitting, tapered to the hip body, on a young woman's jacket. Since you're neither a man, not middle-aged, they should know better, and this is just really really shoddy tailoring on their part.  In general, they do better if you give them an item to clone, but since you say that's not an option, I'd just ask them to refund it. You can either try again with a tailor that specializes in women, or just buy an off-the-rack jacket that fits in the shoulders, armhole, and bust, and get the waist, arms and torso tailored."

I agree with serenissima that there is a lot off with the jacket.  I also think the sleeves are too wide and the back needs to be fixed.  The back is either not wide enough at the hips causing the material to bunch up at the waist, is too long, not shaped enough, or most likely a combination of all of the above."

The t-shirt in the pictures is a pre-pregnancy t.   The tweaks that need to happen will probably mostly happen after I've delivered and we can see how things should hang. The reference photo I gave the tailor was a BiuBiu blazer designed for women with big busts, and he's not used to having people who have 10"" differences between bust and waist, I think, so this was a new project.   Sigh."

They look too big when you have your hands on your hips, but standing straight, I don't think it's too bad.  However, I agree that the armholes are too big and the sleeves are too wide. Also something is wrong with the back - I think it needs to taper more and then flare out to cover your hips. Is there no vent? I think that's making it lay oddly (although I know jackets exist without vents).   Most importantly to me, I think it looks frumpy because the button stance is so high. I think jacket look more flattering with a lower button stance that hits near your narrowest part."

I wear them alone sometimes (used to wear them alone ALL the time in high school) but I find the American ones have SLIGHTLY thinner fabric than the Japanese ones, so they look a bit better with layering. If you are very trim, they probably will serve fine as your exterior layer but if you have any lumps or whatever, they can be slightly underwear/shapewear looking.  They look great with knee length full skirts or looser pants, IMO, or layered under sweaters/cardigans. The one look I'd avoid (that I rocked hard all through high school) is just the Heattech shirt alone with tight jeans. It's kind of bare/unfinished looking, esp considering the American ones are a bit lighter-weight fabric.   I love the long sleeve shirts with the U-necks and the leggings.

Here they are straight out of the box. Excuse my clumsy posing, it was hot as heck and I was sweating like crazy. xD Overall I like both, though the Hope sweater is larger than I thought it would be. Not quite large enough to be properly oversized, not slim enough to fit properly. The coat is comfy as a baby's blanket, and the denim-ness isn't that apparent in pictures.

That way they're slouchy, and you can make them off the shoulder. To me, that's feminine without screaming girly to me. It'll be easy to transition that into an androgynous wardrobe. A baggier top with slim bottoms would work.   Another tip: match your shoes to your pants! This especially works for black shoes and pants. It ceases the illusion of a long, lean figure. Pair that with a slouchy top and you get a very androgynous look. Mitch Grassi is my androgynous style icon."

femalefashionadvice,3e164r,purplenat,2,Tue Jul 21 15:48:33 2015 UTC,"I have no personal experience with this, but my best guess is     Buy shoes in flexible, breathable fabrics. Leather is great. Make sure they're also lined with a breathable, flexible fabric. When the fabric is flexible is adapts to your foot shape instead of making your foot adapt to it.  Insoles. Find an insole that is designed for your exact foot instead of trying to find a shoe with the perfect insole. You may need to buy shoes that are slightly bigger to fit the insole comfortable. Trial and error.  Only buy shoes you can return. Wear them around the house for a whole day before wearing them outside. Do the dishes, vacuum, dance around.  I always carry a tube of blister block. This prevents blisters due to friction, so apply BEFORE, but feel free to reapply liberally throughout the day."

As for having somebody re-knit it, I don't know what company you're talking about, but it is almost certainly going to be WAY more money than what you're willing to spend on a thrifted sweater.  As in, it would take me probably 75 hours to deal with it, and I'd want at least minimum wage for that time.  Also, you don't know the quality of the wool that was used, and my guess is that it's a very fine gauge (aka a lot more work).  It would be far easier to commission a custom sweater at that point.  What is definitely more likely is that somebody would just seam the sweater with a sewing machine to tailor it.  You just need somebody who knows how to work with stretchy materials (knits) and it'll be fine.  If the shoulders need to be taken in it will be a bit of work, so be prepared to pay for that too."

What they're doing is nowhere near unraveling a whole sweater and reknitting it.  I'm sure they could if you asked, but like I said, that's probably cost-prohibitive.  Knitting is directional, so it's easiest to take out a hem or neckline, pick up the live stitches, then finish them off with limited amounts of hand-knitting.  What you want is the sweater to be sized down 3 whole sizes, which will involve altering the length, side seams, shoulders, armsyces, sleeve caps, sleeve lengths...  Unless you want this to be an heirloom-quality garment that will last you 15-20 years, I would highly recommend just taking it to a regular tailor and getting it brought in where you need it."

Does anyone know how I should pick this one out? I don't like the blue/white scheme or the plain square print at all ( I prefer the LV ones).  Any ideas at how to make this decision? I want to use it for more events, and make a statement vs. daily use."
femalefashionadvice,3e164r,asian_panda96,12,Tue Jul 21 12:20:26 2015 UTC,Recurrent logo prints are really out right now and people in fashionable circles tend to regard them on fancy brands as rather gauche statements of wealth at best and crass and ugly at worst (or since the LV Print bags are the most faked bags out there many just assume they are fake) so I would go for a subtle pattern and color if I was dead set on LV print (they have a nice all black bag series where you have to look to see the print) rather than signature brown and dark brown. Just my two cents though.   In my view though LV makes some really nice stuff that they don't slap their logo all over and I'd get one of those items.
femalefashionadvice,3e164r,ilikepai,7,Tue Jul 21 14:03:28 2015 UTC,"I agree with this! Also, LV Monogram bags are made out of canvas, not leather. If I was paying $800 + dollars on a bag, I'd rather buy a leather bag. This is just my personal opinion though. :)"

As /u/XVOS pointed out, they're really not fashionable right now. Instead, it might be a fun nod to your shared initials by getting something smaller."

Also, his parents live about 2 hours away from where I am (so something comfortable for the car ride is a plus!).  I have a couple of ideas, but I was hoping to run them by someone...

femalefashionadvice,3dz6nl,smash__lampjaw,2,Tue Jul 21 11:09:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah it is definitely not as nice, but I have bought really nice clothes on there. When I first went there, the CEO emailed me because I had a huge shopping cart and I never made the purchase. I told him about stuff that made me unsure of the site (not free shipping back and not having the measurements on the clothing.) I went back to twice and never thought twice. When Thredup moved to a more similar shipping situation as Twice, the CEO emailed me telling me that they have made changes that I should look at their website again.  I also love the 3 day shopping cart. It is just so much better than an hour, I can really think about my purchases.  There is no way I'll use EbayValet unless you can return stuff that does not fit with free shipping. That is pretty much the whole point of why I shopped at Twice."

femalefashionadvice,3e0mrh,lydf,25,Tue Jul 21 01:18:03 2015 UTC,You may want to consider looking into local bridal seamstresses. With your more minimalist tastes and a budget of $1500 you could get nice work from a pro.
femalefashionadvice,3e0mrh,jfedoga,19,Tue Jul 21 04:06:24 2015 UTC,"With that sort of budget, I wouldn't walk into another boutique. I'd get a good picture of the Breakfast dress, and find a dress maker in Halifax to make you that, in white and ideally silk or satin. That dress isn't complicated, it just requires good basic skills and a good fit. A custom dress in that pattern is unlikely to cost you anything near your upper end for your budget work-wise so you can get high quality fabric and pay for an extra fitting if necessary.   I can't offer any suggestions for dressmakers, but with the amount of military in Halifax and areas, there are going to be good tailors and dressmakers around town, guaranteed."

femalefashionadvice,3e0mrh,ee_bird,11,Tue Jul 21 04:39:38 2015 UTC,"Are you open to ordering from a custom dress shop in China if it has good reviews? I ordered from Jasmine's Bridal Shop after obsessively reading the reviews on Weddingbee. The dress was absolutely perfect, and the custom sizing is rather nice to avoid alterations. They'll replicate any dress that you can send them a photo of (preferably front and back). Mine cost around $600, which is great for a wedding dress, particularly one that doesn't require alterations if you don't change weight after ordering it. The only caution is that you should order your dress with plenty of time to spare, and preferably tell them your wedding is a bit earlier than it is. Otherwise, the dress would arrive last minute, which is stressful."
femalefashionadvice,3e0mrh,silkrobe,3,Tue Jul 21 04:41:55 2015 UTC,I've heard amazing things about them. I love this shop so much I've stalked them on social media to make sure they are legitimate because when I get married I want to order from them. What was your experience like?
femalefashionadvice,3e0mrh,Love_Trust_Hope,2,Tue Jul 21 10:18:07 2015 UTC,"It was good. I thought the quality seemed a lot better than the dresses I'd tried on at David's Bridal shop (that said, it was still 100% polyester), and I found the ordering process easy enough, although I did email back and forth a bit to make sure there weren't communication errors. And, as I said, the dress came right before the date I'd told them, and if my wedding was actually that date, I wouldn't have been able to have any needed modifications (I'd gained a bit of weight, unfortunately, and the dress had sleeves, so I ended up not being able to raise my arms properly. Unfortunately, the seamstress I went to in the US made the dress look worse, although I ultimately was able to move my arms more). But I told them a wedding date a month before my actual wedding, which was probably a good idea. I think I just paid for their basic level of sewing and fabric, because I didn't really feel more was necessary. There was an extra charge for it being plus size.  So, yeah, I would definitely recommend ordering from them, but make sure you order well in advance of your wedding so that the dress has plenty of time to arrive. If you expect to have weight fluctuations, find a good local seamstress, and don't take it to someone you're unfamiliar with."

femalefashionadvice,3e0mrh,lindseysometimes,25,Tue Jul 21 16:15:13 2015 UTC,"Ugh. wedding dresses. If I could go back and redo my wedding I'd spend a 100-200 $ on whatever looked ok and I could actually wear again. So much wasted money. The dress itself was bad enough, but that doesn't even cover the tailoring, petticoats, bags, steamers, the veils, corsets, jewelry, shoes, etc. Plus getiing in and out of them? Bleh. And if you gain or lose too much weight before the wedding -- game over.  That being said -- I'd look into local boutiques. They have less mainstream dresses and can point you in the direction of designers you like. JJ house tends to have less ""sparkily"" gowns as well. If you can't find anything like that, I'd hit up a local seamstress (or etsy) to make you the one you want."
femalefashionadvice,3e0mrh,pineapplesf,2,Tue Jul 21 01:44:36 2015 UTC,"To the folks reading this thread who actually want to order a cheaper dress online:   I ordered my through Dressale, and although it wasn't a dress I would bet would last decades (it was pretty cheaply made) to be passed down or anything it did the job for only $300 after shipping and all. And it was custom made to my very plus sized measurements.  This was my dress on their site. My one singular experience as well as the reviews on the site, puts this place at cheaply made but reputable.  Note, they don't accept returns on dresses made with custom measurements.   BUT.... if you are going to order your dress online, especially if you are going to get it custom made to your measurements, you absolutely need to test drive similar dresses in a store somewhere. Seriously, I absolutely regret my dress choice not because of the place I got it from but because the dress was not designed for someone as busty as I was with such a short torso and neck and it ended up looking a bit comical.  I absolutely would have gone with a different cut had I tried a dress similar to mine on in a store."

femalefashionadvice,3e0mrh,sobok,3,Tue Jul 21 08:27:56 2015 UTC,"Someone who worked in a fancy boutique - there's a reason we downplay the size.   In bridal you have to add 2-4 size numbers from streetwear to get your bridal size, and size numbers matter to a lot of women. It makes them feel pretty shitty to buy a size 10 dress, and I have seen women buy a certain dress because they fit an 8 instead."

You could try looking for it on preownedweddingdresses.com, but that's always a hit or miss with sizing since people are selling their pre-owned wedding dresses (hence the name of the website).

femalefashionadvice,3e0uv1,ZeroFlux,17,Tue Jul 21 02:23:56 2015 UTC,"My first instinct would be to research her measurements more and try to find stores or brands that might fit her better.   I think this is a good instinct, but to be honest with you there is so much variance between a) how different items from the same brand fit, b) how the fit of the same item varies between people even with similar measurements, and c) how people prefer things to fit when choosing between different sizes and styles.   With all of those variables, there is just no reliable way that your research will lead to a foolproof set of brands, items and sizes that will fit her and she'll like. Your/her time would be better spent just trying things on and observing any patterns in fit or preference that might help her develop her own roadmap for what she likes.  You mentioned that she's very busy. Ultimately (as you might know from experience), developing personal style takes a lot of time as well as trial and error. It's not that there's a threshold below which I'd say you can't refine your style if you're not willing to spend X amount of time thinking about it... but I would caution that it's only realistic to expect as much improvement out of one's wardrobe as the amount of attention she's willing to devote to it.  How about sharing with her some of the posts or guides here that were interesting to you? Then maybe if she's interested she'll take it from there."
femalefashionadvice,3e0uv1,tomlizzo,10,Tue Jul 21 02:56:50 2015 UTC,"As a piece of general advice (btw I think it is wonderful you're so supportive!), go shopping with her and be an active participant (if you're not already one). My SO comes with me shopping and dives in, picking items out and having me try them on. He's also honest about when he doesn't like something, and he tells me why he doesn't like it. I have a difficult time deciding when I try something on, so his opinion is super helpful. It'll also help YOU as you learn more about your GF's clothing tastes and preferences, so you can find some items on your own! Some of my favorite outfits are ones my SO helped me pick :)  Also, I'm not sure if this is an option, but tailoring items with a home sewing machine is (in many cases) pretty easy and only scary the first few times. This would be especially helpful if you find items that fit her well in the chest but are loose in the mid-section. You might be able to find a used machine for a decent price at a local thrift store or garage sale!"

Having someone who cares about you and isn't inside your head with your biases towards/against your own body and style can really be great! For me I end up trying things on I probably wouldn't have picked out for myself and usually end up loving them.

I opt most often for dresses or suit separates (and heels of course)  I concur you should go shopping with her.  I also suggest going to upscale happy hour places to see what other professional women are wearing- and model styles she likes from what she sees.
femalefashionadvice,3e0uv1,Sizzleen,3,Tue Jul 21 04:16:25 2015 UTC,"Do you have a Nordstrom by where you live? (not Nordstrom Rack). I feel as if stores like this have very experienced sales associates to help those who are in need of a style nudge. The SA's act like personal stylists, if you can find one that is good at their job and not super busy. Sometimes, all you need to do is visit a store and try on lots of different styles to see which way you want to go. Invest in a few good quality items (especially for work) like a good pair of slacks and a skirt (if that's her thing) and build from there adding basics that aren't so expensive but still look great. Better yet, it doesn't make sense to tailor your whole new wardrobe, but maybe tailor one or two pieces so that they fit and look good!"
femalefashionadvice,3e0uv1,thrifteye,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:59:45 2015 UTC,"The more she tries on, the more she will understand about what is available that suits her body type.  Button-down shirts are a huge issue for busty women with small waists. There's a thread almost every day on FFA asking how to solve this problem. There are some solutions, but overall it's a tricky style to easily find if you have a dramatic feminine shape.  Her best bet is to go to a large department store and try on TONS of options, regardless of pricing. She can get a better feel for what shapes and brands are great for her needs, and familiarize herself with a specific sense of what ""works"" and ""doesn't work.""   Often we see something that looks bad on us and don't examine WHY it looks bad. Well that's not helpful, you can't extrapolate that for future usefulness. So it's super important to pay attention to where a clothing item creases, shows lumpiness, is too tight, too loose, etc, to understand what is missing in terms of fit. Once she has a few eureka moments e.g. This shirt is perfect except the waist is a little loose, she will be able to navigate racks of ready-to-wear clothing more easily.  I see a lot of people get frustrated because everything looks bad on them, so they stop trying on clothing! NOooo! Keep trying stuff on! It's generally not the person that's the issue, so nobody should feel bad, it's the specific clothing that doesn't suit that person's body. The best thing a self-conscious person can do is try on MORE stuff. She should set aside a few days/weekends to go on pure exploration shopping trips with NO intention to buy, purely to research. This will take the pressure off while she gets used to the experience of trying on clothes.  Tailoring doesn't have to be cumbersome. A lot of people are shy about it because the energy required to find a tailor seems high. My mom started me on tailoring very early because I have short legs, so off-the-rack jeans were always too long. A local dry cleaner can hem my jeans for $10-$15 within a few days. And when I relocated for college, I found a tailor locally with no problems by looking on yelp at dry cleaner reviews. It's a project that takes maybe 2 hours worth of internet searches, an hour or two of in-person errands to find the right tailor, and a single item of clothing that she doesn't mind sacrificing to judge the skill of the tailor. I suggest this because I think everyone should feel comfortable getting clothing tailored!"

I'd like something simple, probably black leather with gold hardware. Whenever I see something I like, it seems to be in the $1k+ range. For example, I LOVE the Celine Trio.  I currently own a vintage Coach city bag, but I don't love the design of the compartments. I often find myself removing a bunch of things to get to something else.  I ordered the Lo & Sons Pearl (which has not yet arrived), but I'm really worried this will be disappointing. The in-depth review on here laments the stitching quality, and I'm worried I'll have the same problem. I love the simplicity and organization of the bag. I love having different compartments to fit a few items so that I always know where to find certain things. If this quality were up to snuff, I'd think this were pretty darn perfect. I've seen Fossil bags recommended as an alternative, but I don't like the 'feel' of the leather Fossil uses (which I suppose may end up being a concern with the Pearl as well).  I can spend up to $700 but would like to find something under $400, if possible. Any recommendations?"

FWIW they shipped me a replacement in black with gold hardware, and the stitching is noticeably more solid. I haven't updated the review because I haven't carried it around for long enough yet, but so far it's an improvement. The leather is not going to be what you expect if you're used to the Coach city bag (much thinner/softer and more heavily processed) but overall I still like the bag. Their customer service is also really responsive so if you have any issues with it I'm sure they'll take good care of you."

The leather is not the same quality as what you're able to afford with the upper limit of your budget, but I don't mind that aspect as much (YMMV). The pockets and organization seem similar to the Pearl (which I was considering as well), and I like the size as well -- big enough to carry quite a bit without overwhelming my frame. The stitching quality on mine is good, and I like the length of the strap. I don't think it's a buy-it-forever bag, but I think it will last me long enough for my purposes."

If it's the colour, try a darker coloured bra. The idea is that you're trying to mimic the shadows, so a darker bra works better. Grey can work too, white definitely does not since it just looks lighter.  As for pet fur... You can just endlessly lint role, or try to stick to fabrics that the fur doesn't cling to. Maybe silkier fabrics? Personally, I try to go to the source and just brush my cat as much as possible. I got the furminator and it cuts down on his shed fur quite a bit."

The only thing I would say is that the bags themselves are quite heavy, so carrying your laptop in it would probably get uncomfortable after a while."

Edit: I'd also like it if they had some nice muted colors like grey and maroon and maybe a hunter green.   I thought I'd found the solution with chinos, and I love these from Maurice's except that they have the stupid slit pockets in the back which don't do many favors for the perceived size of my rear and I just don't like.  I basically want something the shape of those I linked from Maurice's (pretty much shaped like jeans), but with normal rear pockets and a slightly nicer material.  Suggestions?"

I didn't buy it as it was too tight in my calves, and just could have used an overall bigger size. It was a sleeveless type, and I loved the long lean silhouette it somehow gave me.

I've noticed they recently (in the past year or so) upped their prices a bit. They also have a lot more  classy, basic pieces but I haven't gotten a chance to walk in a store to check on their quality.  Edit: Also, can anybody speak on the quality of their handbags and shoes? Their handbags specifically look much more expensive than they are (at least in pics), just wonder if the quality is worth it."
femalefashionadvice,3dyipg,Ms_IreneAdler,3,Mon Jul 20 22:48:41 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: I think each person's opinion about Forever 21 (or similar fast fashion options) is going to be fairly personal, because it has a lot to do with your current age, lifestyle, budget, and thoughts about clothes/fashion.  My personal opinion is that their clothes are not worth the money.  I was just in one of their stores yesterday and remembered quickly why I never go there...  To me, a lot of the pieces are overstyled (too trendy, too much going on) and the quality is so consistently bad.  They also just don't fit my body well.  With the added ethical reasons to avoid buying from them, it's easy not to :)  That said... I bought three more of their $2 camis.  The ones I bought ca. 2010 are in surprisingly good shape (still wear two of them, two that I slept in a lot are trashed).  I'd like to have nicer camis but I'm not willing to pay $20 each."
femalefashionadvice,3dyipg,nayapapaya,3,Mon Jul 20 23:42:02 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure about a major change, but for me it's always been about sifting through the ridiculousness in search of the gems that are usually there. I have several dresses that are pretty nice quality (heavy fabric, have lasted several years) that I get compliments on all the time. One of them was sold on ModCloth for twice the price.   In general I think their basics are higher quality than the more trendy items. Also, I like their ""contemporary"" (formerly ""love21"") line - it's a little less juvenile, and the dresses are more likely to cover my butt (I'm 5'9, so that's one of my big problems shopping there).  I have one pair of sandals from there - they are very simple, so they don't quite look as cheap as they are. I don't expect them to last very long though. Ditto their purses. They're sort of experiment pieces for me - I would only buy shoes or a purse there to try it out for a season, not expecting it to last longer. If I like the style I'll find something nicer somewhere else."
femalefashionadvice,3dyipg,CaliforniaBaeArea,2,Tue Jul 21 00:04:58 2015 UTC,"I was browsing their website and their contemporary line also surprised me! They also had a lot of Kim K-esque pieces (neutral skirts, dresses) that I think I'll check out in store. Thanks!"
femalefashionadvice,3dyipg,pineapplesf,2,Tue Jul 21 00:54:41 2015 UTC,"I have a green crossbody satchel from them. I've only been using it as a weekend bag for the last few months but it's been fine. It holds a fair amount and the strap is comfortable.   I have a fair amount of their clothing, mostly blouses and they've generally lasted me a long time. I have a button up from them that I've had for about 5 years but I only wore it on and off. I have a varsity jacket which I got 5 years ago and which I wear frequently which is still in really good condition. I bought a white Avengers tee from them last year though which I've only worn about 6-7 times but it's already starting to look used. I chalk that up to it being white though. I think they are trying to improve their quality somewhat though because I noticed some 100% cotton and 100% linen dresses recently and more lined dresses.  I don't think their quality is amazing but I haven't had the issues with it that a lot of people have. My clothes haven't ripped or disintegrated after a few wears/months, but I don't wear those tops weekly though, more like every few weeks. I'm quite fond of their contemporary line and there are some really nice things in their regular line too - you just have to dig through everything. Same goes for the store. I think they have really nice sweaters and coats. I would recommend going into the store and trying things on if you can though because a lot of the blue items they brought out for summer which looked great online, they looked washed out and almost used in person. They do a really good job of styling their models/clothing so it looks great online. Also take note of the lengths of things because a lot of their tops are cropped and they don't always mention that in the descriptions. It's definitely hit or miss but I have some pieces from them that I really like."

Update: It did not happen.  If you crave the pain of both a heel and bare feet your ship has definitely come in.  I assume she jumped off the end of the runway and into a swimming pool.  If minimal hair on shoes is your preference.  Edit: Ok so apparently the hoof shoes is actually a thing and I know nothing John Snow about fashion.

femalefashionadvice,3dwabk,Ohshhhhmamas,26,Mon Jul 20 01:45:43 2015 UTC,"There is totally 100% nothing wrong with wanting to have a uniform of sorts for work. Men do this all the time, the only reason women feel weird about it is because there's a social pressure to look visually appealing which can translate to wearing different/interesting things all the time.    I am a teacher and while I do not wear exactly the same thing every day there is definitely a theme to my clothing and students pick up on it surprisingly fast if I deviate from it. I wear dark wash skinny jeans or tailored black slim leg pants with black flat shoes (could be ballet flats, could be tall boots, could be converse sneakers depending on the weather and what I'm doing that day at school, but flat and black always). My tops are always black, white, grey or a combination of the these colours. I used to wear more colours to work but honestly black/white/grey is so much easier and I want my work wear to be easy above everything else.   If that sounds boring that's because it is, but it works for me. Honestly, the reason I decided to start dressing this way for work was because I am not a morning person and my early morning brain simply cannot cope with the idea of coordinating things. My late night brain can't be bothered most of the time to plan outfits. So I devised a solution where I can grab any bottom and any top from the 'work' part of my wardrobe and I'm good to go. If I want more colour I just grab a scarf or a necklace. Everything goes with black, white and grey so no thinking required there either.  I mix it up more in my personal/weekend life but for work? Ain't nobody got time for that.  Tl;dr uniform dressing is the bomb, go for it."
femalefashionadvice,3dwabk,rubybooby,2,Mon Jul 20 12:08:56 2015 UTC,"to add onto this - just because something's boring doesn't mean it doesn't look good! I feel the most confident and attractive in my boring, neutral uniform pieces :)"
femalefashionadvice,3dwabk,emphesym,7,Tue Jul 21 21:29:32 2015 UTC,"I'm a teacher too and I like to wear basic pants, and I mix things up with different colored cardigans. I just find some neutral  short sleeve tops or blouses that would be appropriate if I get too warm and need to take the cardigan off. Also I like scarves and that can add life to a sweater I wear too often. Finally, I'm not a big jewelry person and feel really awkward with any type of earring, but I do have two little delicate looking necklaces that I alternate and they always make me feel more put together but not super girly or dressed up."
femalefashionadvice,3dwabk,whats_her_face34,3,Mon Jul 20 02:05:41 2015 UTC,"I'm also a teacher, and this is how I dress too. I usually wear black pants or khakis, plain tees or tanks, and cardigans in varying colors and patterns. I'm also the kind of person that's always cold, so scarves are my friends. It's simple, but not so simple that I look like I'm wearing the same thing every day."
femalefashionadvice,3dwabk,blurtington,5,Mon Jul 20 13:25:29 2015 UTC,"I wear a-line skirts in neutral colors, button up dress shirts in whites, blues, and greys (I love the ones from Uniqlo - they're not uncomfy at all), and colorful accessories and shoes to dress things up a bit."

femalefashionadvice,3dwabk,tentacledoll,3,Mon Jul 20 20:50:25 2015 UTC,"I'm a university lecturer so my dress code is super lax, but I like to have a nice conservative ""uniform"" for work. As a GTA I was kind of still finding myself, was freaked out about becoming a ""grown up"" and basically had no real sense of style. Something that's really helped me create a more cohesive style for myself (both at work and out) is coming up with a small color palette (black, white, navy, red and mustard but after a year and a half I'm thinking of swapping mustard for green). I tried a capsule wardrobe but it didn't work, but a palette has changed my life. Everything matches so it's so easy to get dressed in the morning and I feel like looking mostly the same every day keeps my students focused on their work and not my outfit."
femalefashionadvice,3dwabk,Simsbury_Thunderfuck,2,Mon Jul 20 21:34:46 2015 UTC,"I agree! It's my second year as a high school teacher and I decided to stick to a palette for shopping this year (black, gray, maroon/oxblood, olive, and some blues because apparently I can't get away from those) and it has helped a lot as I slowly buy pieces. I am learning that most of what I'm picking this way goes together well if I stick to neutral + color for the big pieces."
femalefashionadvice,3dwabk,ssssshinthelibrary,2,Mon Jul 20 22:27:12 2015 UTC,"I'd look into capsule wardrobes if I were you: a number of items that all go together, so you can basically grab whatever's clean and be done with it.  I'd run with two pairs of trousers and one or two skirts (or more trousers), four or five basic tees (white, black, a neutral, a print and a color), a cardigan, a blazer, two or three button down shirts, and one or two sweaters/sweat shirts. It won't look like a ""uniform"", but will make for easy, appropriate and comfortable dressing. And yet you'll be able to rotate outfits so that your kids won't notice that you are basically wearing the same stuff all the time.  As for shoes: it's not great (for your shoes, for your feet) to have only one pair. Two pairs lets you rotate and will increase the lifespan of your shoes (and avoid stinky feet!)"
femalefashionadvice,3dwabk,leopardprintgrandpa,2,Mon Jul 20 08:09:18 2015 UTC,"I want something closer to what my boyfriend has-- easy clothes that pretty much all go together that I can wear without being judged too much    Are you concerned about being judged by students or adults? For the students, they will notice a uniform and maybe think you're a weirdo, but I don't think it will negatively affect your classroom. Worst case scenario, you'll have to field questions about your laundry habits. A combo of the polos & roll sleeve tops would be less weird from the students' perspective and probably not any more mental strain on you in the AM. I think other adults would only care if your individual outfits were unprofessional. I say, DO IT!"
femalefashionadvice,3dwabk,sr_bun,2,Mon Jul 20 12:36:52 2015 UTC,"I wear exclusively slub cotton shirts when teaching. I have a shapely figure (32-24-36), so I prefer hiding it by wearing relatively loose shirts that fall to my hips. Paired with my 8 shirts (I alternate thoughout the week) are 4 pairs of pants, all the same brand, all black. I have a pencil skirt I wear when I'm feeling festive. It's boring, maybe, but I never have to worry about whether I'm dressed appropriately or spending time putting together outfits. I don't receive any comments from colleagues or students about my 'uniform', but it is a whole ordeal when I wear dresses, which kind of suck. Tl, dr: uniforms are great."

That's two weeks of outfits right there since we can wear jeans and t-shirts on Fridays.  I think last year I just didn't have enough shirts that I liked.  I'd wear the same five or six shirts over and over and feel like I was just wearing the same thing too much.  And a lot of them wore out or got stained over the course of last year, so I need mostly all new ones for next year."

I say this because although middle schoolers can be ruthless, the one thing they can smell from a mile away is someone who is not being true to him or herself. I hope you can feel free to be your authentic self through your clothes--they will not tell you they respect you, but they will feel it. That said, go ahead and rock the polo everyday. God knows being a teacher is hard enough without having to sweat in front of the mirror every day.

It's a direct throwback to 90s fashion, and not in a recycled way like mom jeans. Those chokers mean 1 thing: 90s teenagers. I think it would be very strange for an adult teacher to go to work wearing anything that was a direct reference to their adolescence.  Additionally, anything that's super, super trendy (like a fancy removable septum ring) is going to look strange in a professional setting like a school."

We're a mix of fast fashion pieces and biz cas work wear pieces, although we're re-branding to be trendier and more fast fashion-y.   We're getting our fall items already and judging by our new stock and judging by the inspiration guide the company sent us, it looks like there will be:   Colours: Typical autumn jewel tones like purple, berry, burgundy, royal blue, and forest greens but also, dusty pinks, different shades of grey, and lot of black and white. Some continuation of the oranges, army greens, and light blues we've seen for summer.  Patterns: A lot of geometric patterns, stripes, and polka dots (black and white stuff). A lot of paisley, floral, and other grandma-chic prints.  Styles: A lot of 60's and 70's inspired looks, either mod (black and white, geometric, a-line skirts, shift dresses, super flared dress pants, etc) or hippie/boho (high waisted flared jeans, peasant tops, flowy/boxy crop tops, tunics, etc). A bit of a continuation of the 90's trend with boyfriend jeans, some flannel in jewel tones, and a lot of ribbed cotton-blend tees/tops. We also see a continuation of the jegging/ponte legging + flowy blouse look for work wear. There are still a lot of skinny jeans  but we received a nice amount of flares, bootcuts, and boyfriend jeans.  Accessories:  A good mix between long, pendant necklaces and shorter/choker necklaces. More dainty pieces than large statement necklaces. Lots and lots of hoop earrings. Lots of jersey knit infinity scarves and lots of flannel shawl-style scarves."

Particular denim and chambray shirts. oversized menswear type shirts.  plaid flannel not going anywhere I am seeing a lot of bell bottoms or bootcuts, wide jeans, but I think every year, every season, you see a lot of those right in the advance collections and then you never see anybody actually wearing them in the street so not sure if this time will be any different. jewelry style seems to have definetely changed in the last year, the big statement necklaces seem gone. But a lot more interesting things in earrings: cuffs, etc.   I am kind of wanting a sleeveless mock turtleneck now, which is very 90s..."

I have a very small waist but a 32D chest, so ""fitted"" button-downs always gape AND make me look like a square at the same time. The flowy button downs are juuust fitted enough to show off my chest, but the looseness around the waist is enough to look intentional. I've pretty much given up on fitted button-downs in favor of slightly flowier ones. I do mostly wear this silhouette in a more casual context, but I've had success tucking them into pencil skirts and high-waisted pants for work, too. The blousiness can look really nice if paired with something fitted on the bottom.  Ahh, you just made me realize how many of those I own. I didn't realize that a flowy button-down had become a staple piece for me... funny how things like that can sneak up on you!"

(That last one was a shocker--a corduroy shirt??? It was a gift, and now I rock it constantly in the fall and winter.) Since I fell in love with them, though, I've successfully purchased from J Crew, American Eagle and even Target.   Since the only part of these that needs to fit in these is the chest, finding the right size there is the key. It sounds like maybe you need to size up? Then, if that makes it WAY too flowy everywhere else, you can always have a tailor tame that down."

femalefashionadvice,3ds27b,iixxxxx,39,Sun Jul 19 01:52:08 2015 UTC,"High/Low is usually with very, very uneven hems - starts ""high"" at the front and ends up low towards the back like this. At the peak of their popularity it was all over skirts, dresses, etc. And the hem height difference is very contrasting.  Longline is usually with an even hem all the way through, it's just very, well, long like this. The example I posted has slits on the side, which I've seen a lot, but it doesn't have to have slits. Some do have uneven hems but they're not as evident as high/low.  Hope I explained that well!"

femalefashionadvice,3ds27b,vouloir-saisir,87,Sat Jul 18 23:06:24 2015 UTC,In my opinion ankle boots are definitely very popular but I would not say tall boots are going out of style.  Slouchy faux suede knee high boots I would say are not popular. The leather 'riding boots' that usually end mid calf/ few inches below the knee will probably be around in some form for a few more years.

femalefashionadvice,3ds27b,tomorrowgirl,8,Sun Jul 19 02:32:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've been seeing less of traditionally cut blazers being worn casually with jeans. If anything I've been seeing a lot of longer, looser blazers, often without lapels, being worn casually."

femalefashionadvice,3ds27b,hybbprqag,25,Sun Jul 19 04:53:54 2015 UTC,I really want the colored pants to stay in forever - particularly the muted/darker ones. They're great jeans alternatives if you still want a more casual look.

femalefashionadvice,3ds27b,tequilaandsunshine,42,Sun Jul 19 03:41:56 2015 UTC,I doubt so. I noticed a wane in crop stops at the beginning of Autumn last year also so I think it's more of the fact that it's too cold to wear crop tops in winter.

I think boyfriend jeans definitely have a chance of growing this year (flare jeans definitely not), but skinny jeans won't be going away any time soon."
femalefashionadvice,3ds27b,Conceptizual,13,Sun Jul 19 14:02:55 2015 UTC,"I think it's safe to say that the skinny leg silhouettes are very, very gradually being phased out and replaced with looser fits such as straight legs or relaxed fits (ex: boyfriend jeans but with tapered ankles.)  In NYC, I've been seeing uber fashionable people wearing cropped straight leg jeans. I also saw some women sporting culottes. So it will probably be a while until that trend really hits the mainstream and we can officially consider skinny jeans ""out.""

Skinny jeans look great on rectangular body shapes, but they are so, so not flattering with my hips. There were some dark years where you literally could not find a pair of pants that weren't skinny.  Now if the business pant world could also catch on to the fact that not everyone can wear skinny pants or ridiculously wide-legged pants, that'd be great... Unfortunately I work in a lab so skirts are off-limits, because a pencil skirt is the only business-appropriate bottom I own that is remotely flattering."

femalefashionadvice,3ds27b,HeadBandHalo,24,Sun Jul 19 12:05:52 2015 UTC,A trend looking bad on most of the population doesn't seem to deter it from being trendy.

femalefashionadvice,3dr36l,Saltyskins,32,Sat Jul 18 17:18:01 2015 UTC,"I have never been impressed with the quality of Express and Gap. I would recommend skipping overpriced mall brands and just buy used. I have a similarly tough time finding jeans that fit, and when I was in college I had similar budget constraints. Secondhand stores were the only place I could find jeans that were worth it to me. It takes a bit more time, but with practice secondhand shopping can be much more rewarding than mall shopping.   Advice for secondhand shopping: know your measurements, look at the pants you own that you like the fit of and look for pants that match that. Identify the more affluent suburbs and go to the Goodwill that is there. Look for well curated consignment shops. It might take you a while to find what you're looking for, but for good quality clothes on a college student's budget you can't beat it."
femalefashionadvice,3dr36l,DrLadyPants,10,Sat Jul 18 17:34:19 2015 UTC,"I second the consignment shop idea! I wear jeans everyday for work, do a ton of walking, & have She-Hulk quads. I have a graveyard of jeans that are perfectly fine except for holes in the upper-inner thigh area. I never wanted to spend a lot on jeans that I would only wear to work which could very likely get messed up from stuff I come in contact with on the job. I got a pair of Ralph Lauren jeans at a resale shop for less than I would pay at someplace like Old Navy. I got a few compliments from coworkers and the jeans have held up beautifully - showing no wear at all in the timeframe it would take for cheap new jeans to be unwearable."

femalefashionadvice,3dr36l,pterodactyl111,7,Sat Jul 18 18:02:27 2015 UTC,"I find that knowing my measurements helps me size up a garment more easily. If I know that I want the waist band to fit at a point where I am 30-or-so inches around I know I need to find bottoms whose waistband looks 30-ish inches in circumference. I have a hard time estimating how big I need something to be just by eyeballing. Having a number makes it much easier. YMMV, of course, but I included it because knowing my measurements greatly eased the thrifting process for me."

femalefashionadvice,3dr36l,DrLadyPants,3,Sun Jul 19 05:55:37 2015 UTC,"They might wear faster, but in my experience that isn't the case. Clothes depreciate very fast and so you get a lot of brand for your buck when you buy secondhand. For example, last month I found a pair of Seven for All Mankind jeans for $30. Those will last me quite a bit longer than any other pair of jeans I could get for $30. Buying secondhand lets you go up a quality bracket, which means they will probably last longer."

I try to only wash my jeans when they get really rank, and I try not to wear the same pair multiple days in a row.  I have had better luck with Levi's than Gap jeans, though. Jeans with a lot of spandex in them wear out the fastest, in my experience."

If you have a Levi's outlet near you, you can get jeans for as little at $10 a pair. Not only that, but their website is always having some kind of sale.

If wearing skirts or dresses, do you have problems with thigh chaffe?   Physical stress, material rubbing against material if not preventable, is something materials all react to, in some degree or another. I think maybe really thick artificial materials (polyester, etc) might be tough to it . Really thick old fashioned denim (not skinny jeans denim, 100% cotton denim) might be somewhat resistant  and if it wears it, chances are it will wear out really beautifully."

I never had this problem until now (I've gained a bit of weight) anyone have any advice? I use the anti-chafing gel by Monistat and it's the only thing that helps with the chafe."
femalefashionadvice,3dr36l,tucat_shapurr,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:50:56 2015 UTC,"The anti chafing gel can only help with the skin rubbing against skin. If the weigh is on the inner thighs and they are rubbing against each other, not much can be done except maybe try to reduce attriction in the rubbing raw, for example with that gel or other products. But if body parts are rubbing against body parts, and the body parts are clothed, fabric rubbing against fabric will wear it (or cause pilling). Some materials will be more impervious to physical stresses, but all be affected somehow.  Gait , how wide your legs are when you walk, the direction your legs and feet are turned can also be an influence, but gait is very hard to consciously alter, even more so than weight and it´s only in a factor in a certain range, if inner thighs are overlapping enough, no gait might be able to compensate that."

I can typically get a pair from there under $30 when they're on sale.  Levi's is also good if you can find them on sale but I feel like the quality has gone down slightly in the past few years.    Taking a little bit more care when washing your jeans will also help them last longer. Wash them every few weeks or longer, this will depend on wear.  I use the gentle cold wash cycle on the machine to wash them and I always turn them inside out. Hang dry them instead of putting them in the dryer."
femalefashionadvice,3dr36l,TheCannoli,2,Sat Jul 18 21:28:44 2015 UTC,"Also part of the 'me too' team!  I thought I'd defeated it after getting a pair of Levi's in a sale only to have them tear within 6 months, no better than a pair from H&M or New Look.  The best luck I've had so far was with my jeans from Uniqlo, but not sure if that's an option where you are. They're quite stretchy which I think helps. They're about £35 a pair, which isn't too bad. Some of New Look's stuff works for me too, they're usually around £20.  I've been told never to wash your jeans. When they start to stink, throw them in a plastic bag and put them in the freezer overnight. That should remove any smells/bacteria (I have no scientific back up here, this is just what I've been advised, seems to work). Obviously, this isn't the answer when you've got stains etc but it definitely does freshen them up without putting a strain on the material. Worth a shot!? Good luck! I'll be keeping an eye on this for further tips!"
femalefashionadvice,3dr36l,ilikepai,3,Sat Jul 18 23:24:54 2015 UTC,"Hi! As someone who tried the whole never washing jeans thing, I definitely think it may have contributed to my jeans wearing faster since I wore them constantly since I didn't have to worry about washing them. Also, I think the dirt and oil and sweat they accumulated may have broke down some of the fiber. So I don't recommend! Maybe wash them once every 5-6 wears like someone else suggested? Uniqlo is in my area and I love their stuff, I'll look into their jeans!"

femalefashionadvice,3dr36l,maibie,2,Sun Jul 19 00:23:32 2015 UTC,"I'm going to chime in here and say that you should definitely go the used route! Do you have a Buffalo Exchange or Crossroads (or something similar) by where you live? I frequently find good quality jeans there for 18-30 bucks. If anything, go to one of those place and try on lots of different brands first, to get an idea of what size you wear. Plus, a lot of better brand denim is made in the USA, which just seems to last longer. I have several J Brand jeans that I've gotten second hand at these resell stores and now thrift stores too! Because I know what to look for and what size fits me (then I can look on ebay for the same style).  Others suggested a tailor, but you can probably go ask your local dry cleaners - many of them do alterations and repairs. They'll go over the thin spots with matching thread, and can blend away the holes and it makes that area much stronger!"
femalefashionadvice,3dr36l,Pachuca__Sunrise,2,Sun Jul 19 02:11:00 2015 UTC,I have the same issue. My American Eagle jeans (I bought used for about $7) have lasted me 2 years and haven't even begun fraying yet!

femalefashionadvice,3dr36l,stopyellingimnotdone,3,Sun Jul 19 05:58:52 2015 UTC,"I wear jeans out in the thighs also. Here are some things that I have noticed and do about this issue:   My full price JBrand jeans lasted the longest, 5 years, before getting a tiny hole in the inner thigh. The Nordstrom Rack JBrand discount pair got holes in less than a year, but that full price, $180 pair lasted a long ass time.  The inner thigh is NOT a highly visible area. Even if the repair is fairly visible when you are inspecting the pants in your hands, no one is going to see the repair unless you are doing some pretty up close and person interactions. Tailors can reinforce the inner thigh area so they are less likely to wear away.   I don't bother reinforcing my jeans, but I do my own inner thigh repairs. I basically keep an old pair of jeans around and I cut chunks out of it and sew it on the inside of the pants where the worn patch is. And then I do a zigzag stitch all over everything to stop the fraying. It holds up really well and no one notices it because I'm not flexible enough to pull that kind of karate kick in skinny jeans."

In general, things that might be good on you: v neck lines, fit and flare tops, wrap or faux wrap dresses."

femalefashionadvice,3dswke,ediblesprysky,3,Sun Jul 19 12:17:20 2015 UTC,"Are you having trouble finding one that actually sits under the bust, rather than cutting halfway down your boobs? Because that's the problem I've had. My advice is, first of all, go for true wraps and size up if you need more room in the chest--you can always tie it a little tighter. (I don't know what size you currently are, but this dress might be great for you. Or this shirt!) If you do faux wraps, do ones that you can adjust. Try ones that don't have a defined seam under the bust, but instead have ruching along the wrapped side that you can play with. This is sort of what I mean, or maybe this (as long as the top part of the wrap isn't attached)."
femalefashionadvice,3dswke,wanderedoff,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:54:23 2015 UTC,"Yah wraps either cut weirdly between my boobs like a messenger bag strap or they go under my bust and cut in weirdly.  I definitely agree that true wraps are better than the faux ones, they always look super baggy on me.  I have a wrap dress that my mom bought and she insisted be sized up but even when I pull it all the way in there is simply too much fabric and I look swamped.  I particularly love the shirt you linked!  I wish I could afford it.  The last link looks promising as it's more about the ruching as you say as opposed to it creating a canyon between my boobs.  Thanks for the suggestions!!!"

The problem with the fruit advice is that it doesn't take everything into account [like balancing shoulder width] and doesn't really help everyone. Sometimes, someone won't fit into one fruit/shape/thing easily. That's okay.   ie, You said you want to de-accentaute your belly, so look towards fashion/outfits that does that. Fit/Flare, skater skirts, maybe are a good start."

The problem is when I look at advice about not accentuating my belly, it often talks a lot about making the hips and shoulders look bigger and trying to appear taller... things I definitely don't want to do.

You are 7"" taller than me which would make me think that your rules might be somewhat different than mine.   Due (I think) to having basically the same leg shape and shortwaistedness though, the lines that I don't like on myself also are not my favorites on you. Example maxi vs Bermuda shorts. The Bermuda shorts that end just above the knee look great on you and on me. The maxi, I think, hits at the wrong spot on the waist and adds too much visual weight to the bottom of the outfit."

I wouldn't worry so much about shape. A lot of the guides for How to Dress if You Are a ___________ don't work for me. I always get recs for wrap dresses because I'm a pear, but because my hips are proportionally so wide, wrap dresses never ever flatter me. A fit and flare dress with a wrap bodice, however, looks much better. So you have to play around with any rules a bit. I love wrap tops but wrap dresses, forget it.  What I like to wear is A-line dresses with a fitted bodice and a sweetheart neckline, and those are hard to find in a style that isn't ridiculously twee. I also like to wear shift or sheath dresses with a true wrap sweater, which is a wrap that is actually adjustable instead of something like this. I have a short waist and these help me define it a little and make it look a smidge longer. Otherwise my shape is lost in a shift or sheath.   I also find these wrap tops work well with slim or skinny pants. Failing that, I like sleeveless button downs with skinnies for summer. I don't ever wear t-shirts on their own because it never looks good. Under a cardigan or hoodie is fine. I also like tunics with skinnies, relatively fitted otherwise again, my shape is lost.  I started wearing unlined/unpadded bras only to decrease my bust size a little bit. Not minimizers, just unpadded. It actually helped my emphasizing my pear-ness."

I miss my other clothes and I've already done laundry twice in 2 weeks which is wayyy more than I'm used to, ha! ....... Yes, there are a bunch of things I haven't worn yet. I don't want to take them out because I chose what I thought are my most versatile pieces, but I'm craving some outfits I've got that I didn't include because they're not as versatile at all. For example, I've got a skirt and top that I literally only pair together, never with anything else. But the outfit was such a staple last year that I'm like what was I thinking leaving it out?! I dunno, this is just hard! I guess that's the point. We're learning :) Besides that, my biggest problem is quite a big issue: taking pictures. I've only taken pictures of 10 outfits so far. I have no qualms recreating outfits for pics but they will probably lack the authenticity of wearing them for real, right? I think the way we feel before leaving the house in our outfits can come through in the pictures.  Now for a positive: I'm enjoying the limited options that I have to dress in. It's refreshing having half my wardrobe eliminated from my options, and I honesty think that it's reducing my stress level especially in the morning. I can often feel guilty about not wearing a lot of my pieces, so it's nice to have a legitimate reason not to wear the dresses that don't really fit right any more or the top my mother got me from Mexico. I can sense a big wardrobe purge once the 30x30 is done.

Logging my outfits on a regular basis is really useful to me, because yay for having a lot of data to sort through and analyze!    Negatives:   I did some of the into-mind worksheets near the beginning of the 30x30, which gave me a really clear idea of my style concept. Most of the stuff I picked for the 30x30 matches that idea, but maybe 20% of it doesn't, and wearing that 20% feels like a chore. I tend to fall into the ""plain t shirt and shorts"" rut, and I feel like I'm being really boring, but darn if it isn't comfy and easy to throw on.

Main takeaways:   It's okay to enjoy how a certain type of clothing looks, just not on you. For example, circle skirts: love seeing them, don't love wearing them.

I chose all my most worn clothes for the challenge and I've definitely coalesced my style but apparently my style is kind of boring.  -I miss having new shapes to play with. I spent all last weekend cutting up old tee shirts to wear around the house because I miss the feeling of playing around with new clothes. -I'm doing laundry much more often. I quit my weekend job so I'm able to bring it to my moms house on the weekends now instead of spending too much at the laundromat. She's not crazy about that though.  -it's really obvious tht my clothes are cheap and don't fit well when I have to wear the same things all the time -it hasn't been helpful in figuring out a more professional style because I do not currently need that in my life  -I'm really disorganized so I thought I lost one of my dresses for the challenge up until like 2 days ago haha  Positives: -it's nice saving money on new purchases that I'm not letting myself make! I'm going to use the money I usually spend on clothes on my first salon haircut as a birthday present to myself!  -I will be moving to a temporary abode where I'll only be able to have a certain number of pieces for the next year so it's nice to work with a limited wardrobe as practice for that.  -I'm definitely figuring out the essential elements of my style! I want my casual wardrobe to look a bit like an off-duty ballerina, but like, a mean one? If that makes sense. It feels good to be able to put a term to what I want to look like, even if what I picture isn't what I see when I search that on Pinterest  -another goal I had was to work on accessorizing. I've done well with using a piece or two every day and it makes me feel more put together.   And goals for the rest of the month: -use some of my less-used pieces of jewelry!  -try to have more fun with the challenge by mixing up my outfits in ways I haven't done before. -try to identify new shapes for a casual wardrobe that fit with my cool new definition for my style"

I actually have 25 fits right now because I started a little early and had a couple of days at the beach of multiple fits.  Pros:   I'm actually getting into interesting clothes every day. I'm working part time and applying for jobs/grad school and so often there were days where I would just stay in a t-shirt and athletic shorts all day. Now I'm working at home in a comfy dress (which is basically a socially acceptable nightgown) and feel more put together. I'm trying new combos. With the limited selection, I'm seeing new possibilities for things that I hadn't thought of before. Granted, it's mostly thinking- ""Oh wait. I can wear a skirt with anything"", but it's a big step for me. I'm loving some pieces I hadn't thought of before. The gray t-shirt dress? I had only worn it a couple of times before this, and now I'm just so excited to wear it as much as possible. Maxi skirt was a huge hit, and now I want another color of it. Chambray shirt is amazing.    Cons:   I need better shoes. So far I've worn by faux birkenstocks almost every day of the challenge. I realize that I'm reaching for them because they are comfortable, they go with almost everything, and (because of my bad leg, my ankles swell a lot) they are loose around the ankle. I think I need to invest in better shoes so that I can get more diversity there.  I'm sick of shorts. I don't know if it's the 30x30, of if I'm just craving fall, but I'm hating all of my fits in shorts right now. I know it is way too hot here to have considered pants, but I'm getting frustrated with the shorts.   Can you help? My remaining challenges   I have a job interview this week! Finally. It's for outdoor education, and the dress code is casual. Do you think it would be ok to wear the polka dot button up and black skirt? Sweater and skirt? Dress and cardigan? I need to figure out how to wear the white sneakers. I haven't worn them at all. I tried them with shorts the other day, but I felt like a 5 year old and took them off. I feel like they are something that looks better with pants. Wear them with a skirt? Thoughts?"
femalefashionadvice,3dqw1z,juluj,5,Sat Jul 18 18:58:39 2015 UTC,"The polka dot top and black skirt is exactly what I would pick out of that group to wear to a casual interview, FWIW. Otherwise I think the sleeveless sheath dress looks solid, but didn't see a piece of outerwear on there that looked like it would work with that. Frankly I am looking for a job too and decided before the challenge that I would not worry about sticking to my items if I were invited for an interview/professional meeting/serious networking event. Money over everything, man.   Also I think your white sneakers might look nice with your grey dress (which I love) and the black denim jacket, but then I think Keds look good with pretty much anything. Since they turn you off when they look youthful, try pairing them with more mature clothing to downplay that. Maybe you'll like it better with button downs or the sheath dress."
femalefashionadvice,3dqw1z,abbypets,3,Sat Jul 18 20:37:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice!   For the interview, I wasn't planning on only wearing things from 30x30 (job=most important), but I wasn't sure what would be best for a casual interview. I was leaning towards the polkadot buttonup/black skirt as the option despite the 30x30! Although- I do have a simple grey shift dress (not in my 30x30), and I could wear with a long sleeve black cardigan? I'm getting caught up on the 'casual' part of the 'casual' interview. I think I'll post both fits in Simple Questions or something and see what the general consensus is.  And that's a great idea for the Keds. I included them because I had seen so many fits on here with similar shoes, and I had a pair in my closet (from back in high school from musicals haha) and they seemed really versatile. Probably just a matter of biting the bullet."
femalefashionadvice,3dqw1z,juluj,3,Sat Jul 18 20:57:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think the black skirt/polka dot shirt is a solid interview outfit in this situation. People here tend to go for the more formal option every time it seems, but for an interview in that field I don't think anyone there would care that much. If this is a place where most of the staff works outside, I would wear something nice that makes me feel really comfortable/confident over something more formal but not as comfortable. Those are both kind of personal decisions so maybe you should go with your gut on this one."
femalefashionadvice,3dqw1z,abbypets,4,Sun Jul 19 02:57:45 2015 UTC,"Positives:   Having so much space in my closet (the half I am using right now, anyway) just feels good. It is definitely a satisfying and stress-relieving thing to have a hanger for every piece, be able to easily see what my choices are, and not have to ""see past"" the clothes that I don't really like or only wear for special occasions.  At minimum this means a closet reorganization in my future, and probably a light purge. Putting my laundry away is so quick and easy!  I'm not even sure that I'm doing it more often, because I wear most things twice or more before washing anyway... my loads are just smaller now. I get to wear the clothes I love more often, guilt-free. It's fun to think about my clothes and my outfits. Getting dressed in the morning is definitely quicker and I know my 30 pieces well enough that I usually have something picked out in my head before I even go to the closet.   Negatives:   I got new things and I wanna wear them!  They are repeats of things I love, in new delightful colors, and it just feels wrong not to be able to rotate them in. I had to skip about a week's worth of days for unexpected lab work, which was a bummer. It's hard to remember to take pictures.  I mostly remember on weekday mornings, so that it's almost part of my routine now, but any other occasion it just flies out the window.  So I have a handful of outfits I might try to recreate for documentation purposes, because it is kind of fun to see them all lined up. Some of the skirts I picked are really awkward for riding a bike, which is how I get to & from work/school.  I've been doing it anyway but there is one skirt in my rotation that I haven't tried yet, and I don't know if I can pull it off.  It feels late to be changing things out so I may have to wear that on a weekend, which kinda feels like a cop-out.   Other thoughts:   Speaking of skirts, the challenge has made me wear them slightly more often, but only because I included 3 and know I have to wear them each at least once.  Skirts/dresses barely enter my brain as an option on a typical day, and part of that is habit, but part of it is that they are slightly limiting.  There are just certain things you can't do as easily or comfortably in a skirt.  BUT, playing around with the skirts that sit below my waist has made me contemplate owning a skirt or dress that hits above the knee, which would be a huge departure for me, so that's kind of exciting. I don't know how well I would like this or pull it off in winter.  I have only three outerwear/long-sleeved pieces and I know in my climate I can get away with that in July.  I don't know how I would get rid of enough tops/bottoms to bring in more jackets and sweaters."
femalefashionadvice,3dqw1z,mokoroko,2,Sat Jul 18 22:58:08 2015 UTC,"I'm feeling the quick dressing too! So nice to have a smaller amount of stuff to pick from.   On the bike issue... could you wear athletic shorts/bottoms you like to bike in and then change at work? I know it's a little awkward, but it may be better than feeling uncomfortable on the bike or having sweaty clothes. Would be worth it for a long morning ride. I know I wear different shoes for commuting every day to be weather appropriate and comfy, and just stop in the bathroom to change shoes each morning before going into the office.   Glad that you're learning to like skirts! Obviously, you don't have to like them if they make you uncomfortable, but they definitely open up possibilities for more silhouettes/combinations."
femalefashionadvice,3dqw1z,juluj,2,Sun Jul 19 00:16:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think wearing shorts for the ride and changing once I get there is likely the best solution, but it adds that extra 'activation energy' so it's easier just to wear something else :)  Drapey skirts aren't really a problem so I can also think about having more of those in my closet.  Every time I think about getting a maxi skirt or dress though, I remember that I won't be able to (easily) wear it to work and talk myself out of it.  Thanks for your thoughts!"
femalefashionadvice,3dqw1z,mokoroko,4,Sun Jul 19 00:32:39 2015 UTC,"A few interesting things have happened:   I switched out a tee for my tan skirt. I ended up getting an Everlane tank instead of the one I ordered from Zara. I had to quit the challenge for a day because I didn't consider athletic clothing in my 30x30 and was going to the beach/hiking. People have been commenting on my repetition, especially with my new black skirt. My roommate has been making fun of me for wearing mostly greyscale. Hey, I put a pink tank in there! And to be fair, greyscale is pretty easy. Ended up accidentally repeating an outfit.   Overall, it's been interesting. I do miss some of my other clothes, but it makes me realize there are some things I own (way back at home) that I really don't care about or miss, and will probably end up donating to my younger sister."
femalefashionadvice,3dqw1z,greyrook,2,Sat Jul 18 23:36:56 2015 UTC,"I'm really enjoying it so far! I do miss a few things from my full wardrobe, but I've also realized there are a lot of things I can get rid of. I'm not 100% happy with the versatility of some of my choices but I feel like I have enough clothing to mix things up. I also don't get paralyzed by choice when getting dressed in the morning which is good.   I've realized my wardrobe is lacking in denim shorts that fit properly/I actually like, and also stylish lounge bottoms (just ordered some drapey pants from BR and need to find more soft shorts as well).   I've mostly been satisfied with my clothing choices suiting my practical needs,  but today it's storming in San Diego and I don't have good shoes for this. Not the end of the world since I just ran some quick errands and plan to stay inside until Monday, but this does make me realize how useful it is to have easy access to out of season items."
femalefashionadvice,3dqw1z,mcpgn,3,Sat Jul 18 21:01:39 2015 UTC,"It's going pretty well, overall, in terms of getting dressed everyday.  BUT, Looking at my fits I feel so bored...  I think the problem is: ALL MY TOPS ARE V-NECKS!  I like square, boat, and scoop styles, but I just don't have any in my wardrobe at the moment. I like halter tops but they draw a lot of attention to my somewhat broad shoulders.  I also discovered that I'd like to have some work-appropriate skirts! I usually wear a uniform with skinny jeans-- I'm not comfortable wearing short things to the office!  So just adding a couple things to my mental shopping list ;D"
femalefashionadvice,3dqw1z,MsYutai,2,Sun Jul 19 01:31:54 2015 UTC,"I feel like the 30x30 challenge is going ok. I have cheated a couple times, but I am ok with that. It is definitely making me realize that although I miss the clothes I cannot wear, there are some things that I have been holding on to for so long that I don't think I need to keep holding on to. I have noticed some interesting patterns and I am hoping to break those patterns in the remaining time, as my whole schedule is going to change and be much more flexible. I picked 3 skirts to wear during the month and have only worn 1 so far. I have worn my 3 pairs of pants many many times. I have only worn one dress, even though I picked 3. Part of this is because I was working in SF where it is cold, and I live in the east bay, where it is warm, so I had to dress for the weather. But now that my summer camp has ended, I plan on wearing the skirts and dresses more. But who knows what will actually happen. Pants are my go-to outfit, so we will see. At the least it is showing me what my outfit patterns are and hopefully I can either decide to change that up a bit, or just embrace it and not be so boring with it (ie, get stuff from other places rather than just madewell.)."

The ones I have are uneven at the hem.  MY PALAZZO PANTS MAKE MY BUTT LOOK BIG BUT UNDEFINED. They have been replaced with a navy polka dotted maxi after one wear.  My favourite black t shirt cuts off at an unflattering point at the arm. I can't fix that.  My favourite white t shirt is so flattering after being bleached but it keeps on getting stretched out.

I am hampered by lack of tops with the pair of pants and skirt I chose. It's forced me to make some different choices than I normally would, so really that ends up a positive.  I need/want a better black completer piece than the small cardigan. I've been hunting for a summer black jacket but haven't been successful so far.  I always wish I had chosen more shoes. :)  Next time, I am doing work clothes only. Or debating it....  My uniform of dress + completer (especially my new jackets) is my favorite.

Work your way up to a ""good"" suit as needed.      I suggest you go to macy's. They have a lot of affordable suits and a lot of brands. Don't worry about the fabric, just that it fits well.

It helped me decide that pants were the way to go for me, and I liked the look of navy better than black. Is hitting up your local mall an option? Most people will require some sort of alteration on an off the rack suit, but I think purposefully getting a size too big may cost quite a bit to have tailored."

femalefashionadvice,3dqusd,mcnunu,11,Sat Jul 18 16:54:45 2015 UTC,The problem with most cheap suits is that they are usually made out of cheap synthetics which just fit funny. I'd definitely opt for a wool blend but stay away from linen as it creases like a mofo. I also would not buy a suit that requires too much tailoring as suit tailoring is rather pricey. I have found Theory suits at places like Winners (Canadian equivalent of Marshalls). At a push I'd go to a place like Zara.

This is the most difficult element of a suit jacket to alter, most tailors won't do it. Other than the shoulders, sleeves can be shortened or narrowed and waists can be brought in.   I'd first check outlet stores if you have any nearby. Banana Republic Factory, Ann Taylor Factory, J Crew Factory, NY&Co outlet are all good have cheaper prices. After that I'd check out other stores such as Express, The Limited, Loft, and NY&Co.   For shoes I'd stick with a conservative closed-toe black heel. No platforms, and preferably something a little higher than a kitten heel.  I'd suggest looking for a black suit jacket and black suit pants or skirt. Pick up both skirt and pants in the same fabric if you can afford to to make your suit more versatile. Also I'd suggest wearing a white or light-colored silk-like shell or collared shirt underneath, but any color will do."

I got a charcoal suit from Express when I started law school, and it's been totally perfect so far. I'm personally not a huge fan of kitten heels, because to me they always end up looking dated, so I just got some low but not kitten heels, one pair in black suede and one pair in patent nude, and I haven't found myself wanting or needing any other heels so that's been good.

I didn't end up going with the Canada Goose jacket because for the price, the fill power of the down isn't that great and the coyote fur kind of skeeves me out. There is also a bit of a stigma against them where I'm from.  If you are interested in other options, the Patagonia Duete parka is a pretty nice, although it does run pretty small.

femalefashionadvice,3do9f6,sierrasecho,11,Fri Jul 17 22:02:23 2015 UTC,"How does one avoid hopping on a trend too late?  I'm 33f, and going through a career change (yay!) from offices to dirty field work. As I'll no longer need to wear business casual through formal getups, I can devote my clothing $ to my personal style. I am very, very excited for this.  My style has tended towards ""classic, simple & timeless"" - though I know full well that term is all but meaningless. I am not a churner in my wardrobe. I hate poorly made items that I can only get a few wears out of, so I have been buying better made, higher quality (though not designer) goods, usually used. As these items tend to last longer than a style/trend does, I find myself with a collection of items that I still love, that are in perfectly good condition, but no longer look current. (e.g. I have LOTS of cashmere, solid coloured, fitted but not tight v-neck sweaters, or simple little leather shoulder purses. I see more draped fits for sweaters, and more crossbody bags, and not much at all of the items I own.) It leads to a vicious circle - I then tend to avoid flash-in-the-pan trends as I don't support that from an ethical/environmental/financial stance, but end up with a dull, generic and somewhat dated look.   I bought a pair of Cole Haan beige suede ankle booties yesterday, and a pair of Corso Como dels in nude (both second hand) today. I envision lots of cases I can wear these items, but worry that I'm late to the party and I won't get use out of them before they are dated. As well, they are pretty ""basic"" items. I can't seem to distinguish what will last (e.g. skinny jeans) and what will fade and make me look out of touch.  How do I break myself out of this cycle? Accessories? More ""statement"" items? Sorry if this is a bit disjointed. I'm torn between really liking some items, and realizing that they are not presenting an image I want to present: clean lines, modern, effortless, 'model off duty"" ish, confident, fun. I really like the structured, yet simple, somewhat minimal aesthetic out there.  Has anyone else struggled with this, and have any solutions? Perhaps it's just a change in my perspective I need."
femalefashionadvice,3do9f6,justgoodenough,15,Fri Jul 17 23:10:49 2015 UTC,"I think the most important thing at your age (our age really, because I'm close enough to the same age), is to really figure out your style and what makes you happy. It sounds like you have done that.   Now it's really just a matter of making purchases that fit your style. Even if you buy pieces that are slightly more trendy, they won't stand out as being too trendy because they will mesh with the rest of your style.   I also think it's okay to wear items that are examples of older trends. Outfits start to look dated when you have a bunch of old trends together, but if you have a single item and you pair it with items that are more classic or in line with current trends, then the outfit as a whole doesn't read as quite so dated.   Also, I personally think that given the trends we are seeing now, even if they don't stick around, I think they will work as you get older. So, really loose or boxy items might not stay trending in the next few years, but it's not like there aren't women in their late 30s wearing looser fits. It's extremely common for women to choose looser options as they get older. Midi skirts are a trend that I personally would not expect to see lasting another 5-10 years (I might be wrong, I don't have a background in fashion) for young women, but a tea length skirt or dress is nothing new for women over 35.  Now, in terms of shoes, I don't think you should worry about it. The fact is, shoes have a pretty short lifespan. If you wear a pair of shoes regularly (like once or twice a month), you're probably going to get a few years out of them at most. Even if you repair them and resole them, they're still going to start looking pretty beat up, just because that's the nature of shoes. You are literally dragging them along the ground under the weight of your entire body. I think if you plan on getting an expensive pair of shoes that you want to only wear a few times a year so they stay in perfect condition, then you should choose a classic style, but if we are talking about shoes that you wear often, you might as well go crazy.   EDIT: Do you have any examples of trends that you are interested in, but unsure about? Honestly, that's what we are here for, you can can always ask people in the simple questions thread."

Til now, I've either used a way too big bag or a hot pink duffel I got for free from Ulta. Yesterday on a whim I ordered this bag in cognac from Sole Society, bc it really has fantastic reviews (except for the smell, which apparently goes away).  Since then I discovered Veeshee bags, which appeal to me because they're a little bigger and more customizable. I'm also assuming they're more durable than a cheaper, fake leather bag, but I have no real basis for thinking that. Now, I'm considering ordering a Veeshee Tuscany Weekender too, or returning the other bag and getting the Veeshee instead. Do y'all think it's any more durable, though? The outside and inside are linen, with leather details, straps, and bottom.  I take maybe 4-5 weekend trips a year so would use this bag for that purpose mostly. I wouldn't take it to work or the gym or to any other place more regularly. So, I don't expect a bag like this to sustain daily use, but I also don't want to invest $200ish in something that will last a year or two at most.  What do y'all think? I'm open to other suggestions and recommendations. I did read past posts on these kinds of bags, and this one was especially helpful. I'm particularly interested in staying under $200. I don't want to invest in a very high quality bag right now or rely on a great thrift store find, though I'm open to doing either/both in the future and will for sure return to y'all's recommendations!

Let them dry naturally, not near heaters, and preferrably stuffed with something to keep shape. This is really important. You can´t wear wet shoes two days in a row. Wet leather can get deformed, stained, etc.... ocasionally clean them up, some leather cleanser and polish them. Even some body lotion or cream might be good enough to moisturize them a bit - I use nivea cream a lot on leathers. Dry leather is fragile to scuffs and stains and marks.  when you store them make sure you are storing them stuffed with paper or molds (keep the ones where they came in from) so they do not get deformed in storage."

I've had a couple other wireless Hanes bras and have really liked them as well. If you get one with just a thin layer of padding, nipples are not at all an issue, and honestly I feel just as supported in one of these as I ever did in an underwire bra.  If you have a Ross in the area, that's where I've found pretty much every bra I've ever owned. The Hanes ones don't tend to be pretty, but they're super comfortable and functional."

It's really comfortable, has a little bit of lace around the edges and is kind of long line. I also have a kind of bulky black soft bra from TJ Maxx which is from either Bally or Hanes. It is really comfortable though and it has some type of cooling feature. I also have an Old Navy bandeau with ruching which is generally comfortable and good for strapless bra purposes.

I really like them, but since it's uncommon for men to wear platforms (creepers and boots excepted) I would like some advice on how to style with them. Thank you!  (P.S. I want to avoid skinny jeans, but I'm not averse to bootcut of any sort)"
femalefashionadvice,3do9f6,adventurefine,6,Sat Jul 18 03:36:16 2015 UTC,"These sandals really intrigued me, and I started poking around trying to find images of guys wearing them different ways. That was a little hard to come by, so instead here are a bunch of pictures with a style that I think could be promising with them (keep in mind, this is just my random brainstorming for fun - might not be what you're into).   Ripped Jeans:  Not-so-skinny ripped black jeans with over-sized shirt  Another example of the above-type look I think having the cut-off above ankle would be important for the sandals.  White shorts. For some reason, I like the idea of breaking up or softening the line of the shorts like this, so it isn't so crisp. I think that might soften the boxiness of the sandals, help smooth the transition between leg and shoe.   Low-crotch black cargo shorts. These are cooler than the description I could come up with for them. Since the shoes are a little alternative, pairing them with shorts that have a a slightly alternative cut would seem to go well. I like these one because they aren't the norm, but they aren't too outlandish either.  Tapered cargo pants. For some reason, I think this style of pants suits the sandals. Again, a little alternative, but not outrageous. And they look comfortable.   Another example of cuffed cargo pants.   Other than that, I think pairing them with some kind of asymmetrical, slightly novel top and whatever regular pants you have (maybe rolled up a little) could also be great. Something a little unique will help to tie them into an outfit, rather than looking like you just put on a bit of an odd pair of shoes with a regular outfit. Here's some examples:  Asymmetrical detailing on black sweater.  Asymmetric collared t-shirt.  Good luck experimenting! They are seriously cool sandals. This was fun. :)"

Feel free to disregard if I sound like I'm offbase.  I think bootcut with a platform might end up a bit costume-y 70s, which is fine if you don't mind that look, but otherwise I'd be cautious with it. Honestly my first thought was khaki shorts, but if you want to wear them with jeans I'd say a relatively loose straight leg, maybe a more worn/distressed pair? But I think shorts are your best bet. The dude in the fit video is clearly wearing either shorts or a kilt or something, and I think a sandal like that looks better with some bare leg."

I posted about the bag in a thread last month (click through for responses about the brand):   I was at Marshalls yesterday and I saw this black leather crossbody bag. The leather was sooo buttery soft and it had three separate zipper compartments. The brand is Cynthia Rowley?  I mean, I've heard of the brand, but I don't know anything about it. The bag itself had some sticker residue (nothing permanent) and overall I wasn't blown away WRT stitching and construction. The outermost zipper was run externally, i.e. the zipper was not at all ""hidden"" like on most bags.   To answer your question, I carry the following things in my ""every day"" bag: continental wallet, prescription sunglasses (bulky case), Chico bag, clutch/purse organizer full of random stuff, and sometimes a small water bottle. I figured that if I got the bag, I would use it for day trips or going out (something I don't need). I also didn't get it because I'm going to Spain/Italy next month and I figured I might get something there.  The stitching was decent and I wouldn't expect to find any loose threads (unlike what I've read in reviews for the Pearl). Still, unless you can find it on sale somewhere, they're pretty close in price. I think I would have bought it if it were $60-75, but not the $90 that I saw it for. That's my personal reservation price though."

If your toes are in a lot of pain it could mean that your feet are slipping forward and putting too much pressure on your toes when you walk. The shoe is too narrow The shoe itself is just not comfortable The heel itself is too high and your feet are not used to it   I do have the same problem, and it can usually be solved with wearing a pair of good quality, supportive heels that fit well. You said that you've worn the heels only once. That isn't enough time for your feet to get used to the position its now in. Also, some heels need time to break in. You can't put on a pair of 4 inch heels and immediately be comfortable, takes time to get used to them. I have found that 2.75 inches is the highest heel I can wear comfortably. I would really recommend going in store and trying some heels from brands known for making a quality, comfortable shoe."

femalefashionadvice,3dmber,koko_bean,21,Fri Jul 17 13:13:17 2015 UTC,Do they feel tight on your feet? Do the feel too small?  Also Nine West is not a particularly great brand and patent leather shoes don't mold to your feet as well so they could just be uncomfortable shoes.   Try some other brands and types of leather: Corso Como and Cole Haan make some of the most comfortable heels at their price point of $100-200.

Try sites like 6pm.com or even just watching for clearance at department stores.   Unfortunately, there really isn't a comparable brand at less than that. You'll get lower quality and harder to wear heels at that price point. Maybe take a look at Seychelles though? I think they would be in the style you like and within that price range. Or look at some of the shoes available on ModCloth.com?  Given that they may be too large, it's possible your toes are slipping to the front and thus being cramped up there. Usually in heels, you have to go down a half size from compared to flat shoes."

Is that right? Because if that's the case, no wonder they're so uncomfortable. Especially with peep-toes, if the shoe is too big your feet will slip forward and put a lot of pressure on your toes."
femalefashionadvice,3dmber,lanabananaaas,2,Fri Jul 17 13:34:46 2015 UTC,"Yes, they do feel like they're a bit too big, and slip off the back of my heels occasionally. I honestly didn't even consider that that would cause extra discomfort"
femalefashionadvice,3dmber,invaderpixel,5,Fri Jul 17 14:35:09 2015 UTC,"That is definitely the reason. Your foot should be snug against the back of the heel and not slip out at all.  If you are going to buy a new pair, try them on to make sure they fit and try a slightly shorter heel as well."

Your feet are slipping in the shoe and naturally trying to grip to the shoe for stability and that's what makes them hurt. So to clarify, your toes are trying to grip the shoe and since your feet aren't made for that all the muscles in your feet are straining and this causes immense pain."

femalefashionadvice,3dmber,lidka18,19,Fri Jul 17 17:13:36 2015 UTC,"I never used to wear heels, but my chosen profession unfortunately occasionally requires it. So here's my advice as a formerly exclusively tennis shoe type of girl:  Start off with a lower, thicker, heel to get used to it. Although it might not be the exact aesthetic you're going for, I always felt much more confident in a heel that I could manage (even if I didn't LOVE it) than a higher heel I was miserable in. Here is the very similar in height/heel to the first pair of heels I felt comfortable regularly wearing.   The other thing I did that made a huge difference was wearing heels around the house! I'd put them on while I washed the dishes, vacuumed, etc. Just walking around in the comfort of my own home with no one to judge if I wobbled was great practice, and by the time I actually wore the shoes out and about I felt comfortable in them and they were broken in! (Plus there's something sorta glamorous about doing housework in heels...very Betty Draper!)"

femalefashionadvice,3dmber,nayapapaya,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:12:56 2015 UTC,"No offense, but I struggle to understand why heels could ever be an requirement (or even a light obligation) in the legal profession.  What if somebody has a foot or leg problem that makes heels painful or dangerous to wear?  I for one developed haglund's deformity on one of my heels as a result of years as a competitive mid/long distance runner.  Nobody will ever be forcing me to wear heels, no matter what.  It doesn't affect my life whatsoever, but wearing heels can certainly make it worse."
femalefashionadvice,3dmber,Jodie1980,2,Sun Jul 19 04:09:53 2015 UTC,"No offense taken! But it is a reality that if you show up to certain interviews/offices/obligations and are not wearing heels, you will look out of place, and at least some people will view it as you being less professional. I don't particularly like it or support it, but the legal profession is conservative, traditional, and very averse to change! I had a sprained ankle a couple years ago and wore flats to interviews and stuff for awhile and of course the world didn't end, so maybe I shouldn't say it's a requirement, but it is definitely the norm in many situations."
femalefashionadvice,3dmber,Alesandramw,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:18:55 2015 UTC,"Just curious, do you still have the Haglund's deformity? I had the same thing on my heels and had surgery on both feet 18 months ago. I'm a college student so I don't wear heels often; but when I absolutely must, I try to get heels with straps that cross in the front and have only a small strap on the back, with no more than about two inches of a heel. That way I don't have to clench my toes while I walk to keep the shoes from falling off my feet, since the support is reinforced through the whole top of my foot. I still hate heels haha but these make it somewhat better."
femalefashionadvice,3dmber,Alesandramw,24,Sun Jul 19 15:13:56 2015 UTC,"ITS THE PANTY HOSE! Sorry for the caps lock yelling, but I see this a lot and people think it's the shoe but ITS NOT!  Panty hose are slippery against the sole of the shoe, as your foot slips your toes naturally try and grip the shoe for stability straining every muscle in your foot by doing so and causing immense pain.   The solution here is rubber feeling sole and heel grips or no panty hose. Otherwise you need a much lower heel so your foot doesn't slide forward as much.   I've been wearing heels for a long time, my collection is both astounding and horrifying, I know what I'm talking about here."
femalefashionadvice,3dmber,papermageling,3,Fri Jul 17 16:15:01 2015 UTC,That... makes a lot of sense. I should invest in rubber insoles.

Try a different style? Remember when fitting that if you stand up, your foot will naturally slide forward a little bit in heels. But general rule is, if you can fit a finger behind your heel and the shoe, it's a size too big and your feet will slip out when walking."
femalefashionadvice,3dmber,Cutesy_Originals,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:13:47 2015 UTC,I avoid peep toes for this reason. My poor toes can't handle them.
femalefashionadvice,3dmber,mint667,4,Sat Jul 18 23:16:41 2015 UTC,"Maybe you should get a pair of heels from a comfort brand. I have a pair of Comfort Plus heels from Payless which are apparently 3"" high and while they aren't super comfortable (because I rarely wear heels so my feet aren't used to the elevation), it does take longer for them to start hurting me than the other heels I have. I can only ""comfortably"" wear my other heels for about 10-20 minutes but with the Comfort Plus ones, I'm good for about an hour and a half. That being said, if you don't wear heels regularly, they will pretty much always hurt when you do because they force your feet (and the rest of your body) into an unnatural position that they're just not used to."
femalefashionadvice,3dmber,Sizzleen,4,Fri Jul 17 13:53:36 2015 UTC,"As others have said, the shoes look a little large (gap behind your heels) and with the pantyhose they must be trying to slip off your feet with each step. Your feet will try to stop this by trying to grip with the toes with each step, putting a lot of stress on your toes, which could eventually cause ""claw toe"". (If you really love this style of shoe, you should wear without pantyhose or, better, find something similar with an ankle strap.)  Also, if you don't normally wear heels, these are a little too high for a beginner.  Here is something I previously posted as a reply to a similar question:  Wearing heels uses different muscles to flats. If you don't normally wear heels and jump straight to 3 or 4"" you won't have the developed the necessary muscle strength, flexibility and balance skills, and your body will compensate with poor posture, leading to back aches, extra pressure on your joints, discomfort & pain.  Therefore start by getting proficient in low heels. Wear them around the house, doing chores, then running short errands. If they start to hurt, take them off and try again the next day. Each time you will be able to wear them for longer before any pain, and slowly you will develop the necessary muscle strength & flexibility needed to wear heels in comfort. Once you are fully confident and comfortable in your low heels all day, then you can do the same in some slightly higher heels. (Repeat and slowly work your way up in height over months.)  Also wearing low heels regularly (such as a low/medium heel ankle boot to work) will tone those muscles and make wearing higher heels for events & nights out much easier than if you only wear flats every day.  It is also important that you maintain good posture (imagine a string in the middle of your head pulling you upwards) and walk heel to toe,  Choosing shoes:  Heels need to fit well and support your feet well to avoid discomfort and issues.  Every style and brand has a slightly different fit, and everyone's feet are slightly different shapes, so it is important to buy heels that best fit YOUR foot shape. The best way to do this is by trying on as many pairs as possible in stores until you find the ones that fit just right. It may take a lot of effort trying on so many shoes, but it's worth the effort once you find the ones that fit just right. - Don't settle or just buy a pair on-line because you like how they look.  Lack of support under your arches (common in cheap shoes) will cause more weight on the balls of your feet, making them ache, so heels need to fit closely under and support your arches well. Arch supports may help, but it is better to find shoes that support your arches out of the box. They should also be a close, snug fit to your feet (which may mean sizing down) but not so tight that they kill your toes. (Leather shoes are best as they mould to your feet giving better support and less pressure points.)  Never accept that ""heels are just painful/uncomfortable"". Only buy heels that fit well, support you feet well, and are not uncomfortable.  This video gives some good advice on wearing heels and working your way up in height.  PS: There is some really excellent advice in this post."

You're just not used to them yet! That's not to say though that they will feel amazing afterwards. I wear 4-5"" heels regularly to work and yeah some days I just avoid wearing them because they discourage me to walk around simply because I have heels on and they're annoying to walk in. If your feet slip into your pumps comfortably then they should be the right size but if your toes are squished in too tight then it might be too narrow for you. Trust me, heels will never feel perfect! Sitting in them for extended periods is annoying, walking in them for more than just a little will suck, and there is inevitable pain. But for some of us, looking good makes the pain worth it. It just depends on the situation! Some days when I go to the city and want to look nice in heels, I ALWAYS regret it and have my feet dying from walking around all day in the city."

femalefashionadvice,3dmber,sarah-ah-um,4,Fri Jul 17 13:15:26 2015 UTC,Hmm if the pain is that excruciating then there is a high chance that it is just too small? Or that particular style of shoe must be too narrow for you if your toes went numb. The pain from heels usually should be at the ball of your foot from the pressure and a well-fitting heel shouldn't hurt other parts of your foot too much.
femalefashionadvice,3dmber,sarah-ah-um,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:17:28 2015 UTC,"The other commenter here suggested the same thing. They are pointed at the toes, perhaps they are too small. But they also slip off my heels sometime,  so maybe I just need a wider shoe?"
femalefashionadvice,3dmber,invaderpixel,3,Fri Jul 17 13:25:46 2015 UTC,"They might be the wrong shape overall. I have wide toes but an average size heel (yay duckfeet?) so I find regular width heels usually pinch and I walk out of wide width heels. There are some brands that have that shape more, at least in certain lasts (Miz Mooz, for example) but another option for me is to buy a size wide and add heel padding to help keep my toe in.   Another thing to note is that an ankle strap, t-strap, or bootie will help hold your foot in the right position which makes for less squished toes.   I'd recommend looking at the comfort brand type heels on Zappos, because the free shipping and free returns would let you try it out at home and then ship it back if it hurts."

So what I've learned is software engineers (and computer people in general) don't really care about what other people are wearing. If you want to wear dresses -- wear dresses. They may comment the first day, but usually it is positive like, "" wow, you look good,"" ""you are so fashionable, I'm jealous,"" ""did something good happen... You seem different somehow."" In all seriousness, there is a dude at my work who goes around barefoot, in pajamas and a top hat. I have yet to determine whether he likes messing with people, is an anarchist, or is truly that oblivious.   Wear whatever appeals to you personally. Get on Pinterest and create a board that makes you feel awesome. When you wear it, all they will see is how happy and confident you are."
femalefashionadvice,3dn04u,hazeleyes9887,6,Fri Jul 17 16:39:10 2015 UTC,"Fellow software developer here. I also worried about wearing dresses at work when I first started since I was one of 2 women in the office and everyone did the jeans and tshirt thing. That lasted a few months. Now I wear dresses about half the time, and guess what? No one cares. Wearing a dress doesn't have to mean dressy, just wear dresses that are the appropriate level of casual for your office. Tee shirt dresses, jersey knit fit n flares, etc work well for me with flats and maybe a cardigan. Life is too short to wear pants everyday."
femalefashionadvice,3dn04u,hrgrant826,6,Fri Jul 17 20:55:39 2015 UTC,"Hi there,  I kind of understand where you are coming from. I am a female (23) in an all male Electrical Engineering Ph.d. program. While technically being a graduate student, I can get away with jeans and a t-shirt, but in undergrad I didn't really wear that much, which was in Arizona so I wore a fair amount of shorts and athletic clothes. However, I find myself a little more self conscious when I wear those clothes particularly because I interact with a lot of professors/male peers. I also never wear dresses for the same reason.   Typically, I will wear black jeans and a t-shirt or a relaxed button down (i.e. a chambray or plaid). This I can easily wear with Tom's or a pair of white converse. I also think it compliments all body types. You're in tech, so in general, you don't want to be dressed too nice for comfort. One thing I do is shop at Madewell when I can. They usually items that gear towards that easy but clean look. They are kind of pricey, but I find a lot of good items on sale. They also have a fairly nice student discount (%15 on top of what ever percent marked off already) if you still have your old student id. Otherwise, pinterest is your best friend for inspiration."
femalefashionadvice,3dn04u,Helloworld4989898,3,Fri Jul 17 16:47:05 2015 UTC,"Hello! Also a female software developer with similar measurements aged 26. I work for a large company that allows casual dress like jeans and knee length shorts but most wear at least a professional top. The software developers in my company are by far the most casual dressed - typically khaki shorts and a cotton tee shirt.   I think you should ask yourself what you spend most of your day doing. If you write code in your cubbie with the same casual dressed peers 80% of the time, you don't need to invest in fancy. If you meet with customers a lot then you might consider stepping it up a bit. Ultimately it's on you, your peers won't blink twice if you consistently dress well.  As for me, I tend to dress well. My wardrobe consists of nice jeans and silk blouses/nice sweaters/linen t shirts. I live in a hot climate with no real winter so I wear silk/linen 50% of the time and only break out the sweaters as needed."
femalefashionadvice,3dn04u,AxelPrime,5,Sun Jul 19 04:50:39 2015 UTC,"Umm, this is an impossible question to answer. What kind of style are you looking to achieve, what textures do you like? What colours? Are you looking for business clothing or casual or somewhere in between?  You haven't given us anything significant to work with here. You need a clearer definition of what style or look you want to achieve before you can get any help, otherwise there's just too many answers to your question."

femalefashionadvice,3din4f,honeybabby,6,Thu Jul 16 16:02:20 2015 UTC,"I bought two pairs of these BR drapey pants in black and gray, thinking they'd be super versatile. But now I can't for the life of me figure out how to style them, especially shoe wise, as I would be wearing these outside of work (I wear scrubs for a living, yawn) and am like completely inept at wearing heels, and am also pretty casual anyways. Any shoe/fit ideas?"
femalefashionadvice,3din4f,MissA27,9,Thu Jul 16 17:48:27 2015 UTC,"I think either would look great with a well-fitting (but not tight) sweater in black/gray/navy/olive/burgundy/etc.   For myself, I would wear a round neck pullover sweater (I'm thinking the Everlane cashmere sweater) and a pair of structured loafers.   These pants would also work with a white t-shirt (again, fitted but not tight) with a loose front tuck and a jean jacket on top. You could wear flats or a casual pair of wedges."
femalefashionadvice,3din4f,ScoutAtticusFinch,6,Thu Jul 16 18:03:16 2015 UTC,"I find drapey pants incredibly versatile. Since you will be wearing them in a non-professional setting, it somewhat depends on your style. I like to wear tops with a nice drape and do a half-tuck, sweaters if it's cooler, button downs can look nice as well, with the sleeves rolled/pushed up. Pretty much any shoe goes with drapey pants: modern sandals, ankle boots, flats, sneakers, slip ons... It's heavily dependant on your personal style. Joggers/drapey pants are fairly popular around here, so I would recommend that you browse WAYWT posts and/or dressed.so for inspiration."
femalefashionadvice,3din4f,nayapapaya,5,Thu Jul 16 18:32:07 2015 UTC,Maybe you could try pointed or almond toe flats or loafers instead so you get a dressier-looking shoe without having to deal with heels.
femalefashionadvice,3din4f,bexcellent101,2,Thu Jul 16 18:33:05 2015 UTC,"If heels are out, then I would wear them with a low wedge, like this or this"

I think I largely agree with the assessment that the dress didnt go with the vibe of the shoes and headpiece.    Context: The venue is a brewery in Texas in October and I know these shoes in green and headpiece that I want but am having a lot of trouble finding a dress that makes sense stylistically with those pieces. I am thinking something ""nude"" or camel colored. If it helps, the colors I am using for the wedding decor are ivy and camel. What would y'all suggest? Thank you!!! edit: I am thinking something somewhat casual and knee length, but am open to other ideas too!"
femalefashionadvice,3din4f,Tayremorg,6,Thu Jul 16 16:06:42 2015 UTC,Hi! Do you mind my asking which brewery? My husband and I are obsessed with brewery tours and Texas craft beer haha.   Have you ever shopped at Free People? I think a lot of their dresses would go beautifully with your shoes and headpiece. These are my favorites for what you've got already:  Dress 1 in sand Dress 2 in ivory Dress 3 Dress 4 this one would be my top choice if I were wearing your accessories!

femalefashionadvice,3din4f,fourfivesix,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:34:56 2015 UTC,I could go as high as 200$
femalefashionadvice,3din4f,emthefantastical,3,Thu Jul 16 16:37:30 2015 UTC,"Based on your sandals and headwear, I would go with something simple, made that had some swing to it. Something flowy, but not super grecian because that can look a little too cliche. Something like this, or something similar with some interesting/edgy beadwork detailing could be fun.   I also like the idea of a wrap dress that I think someone else mentioned!"
femalefashionadvice,3din4f,fourfivesix,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:02:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your help! Yah I was concerned about taking the imagery too far and looking like i'm wearing a costume. It is interesting that the shoes and headpiece are reading more as Grecian, I was thinking kind of woodland nymph-esque but in either case I think your idea of something flowy is a great idea!"
femalefashionadvice,3din4f,PrairieJack,3,Thu Jul 16 17:07:11 2015 UTC,"Red and green are complimentary colors (opposite each other on the color wheel, I posted a link to a color wheel in reply to userpparkaworks). To not look like a Christmas decoration go for a red shade and not basic red. Try fuchsia (red violet) or mauve (muted red violet-ish). I think a coral, rust, or peach color would work also. Since your shoes and headpiece are so ornate I'd opt for a solid colored dress or if you can only find a print dress one that has small prints (like ditzy flowers, pinstripes, or polka dots).   Edit: Style wise...I first thought of 70s goddess dresses, but I don't know if that is too cliche. You might look like you stepped off the set of the original ""Clash of the Titans"". Maybe it goes too well together? I'm not sure.  Maybe something simple like this, or a 70s/80s wrap dress like this, this, or this. The last one is a Diane von Furstenberg worn by Amy Adams in ""American Hustle"". Here's an article on more of the looks from that movie."
femalefashionadvice,3din4f,fourfivesix,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:33:02 2015 UTC,I do love the idea of a rust colored dress! Do you think this could be good or am I just way off base?
femalefashionadvice,3din4f,PrairieJack,3,Thu Jul 16 16:41:42 2015 UTC,I think the bunching on the side and back looks weird. Maybe something more smooth and fluid.

Any suggestions for what would work? I'd like to make it more colorful on top if possible.   EDIT: Thanks for the advice! I have one more question: I have a job interview with Rite-Aid next week, and I was wondering if a cardigan in place of a blazer would work fine?  It's hot here, and I've also gained a little weight and my blazer doesn't really fit right. This and this are what I had in mind along with black pumps.

femalefashionadvice,3din4f,fireshine,11,Thu Jul 16 20:41:12 2015 UTC,You could wear any color on top. Black and white stripes leave you with endless options on how to style this.

I'm not exactly sure where my pants are supposed to hit at my ankle but I feel that the actual length of the pants may be a bit too long? Does the cuff look stupid?
femalefashionadvice,3din4f,pikadegallo,16,Thu Jul 16 19:15:00 2015 UTC,It's kind of hard to say due to the angle of your photo and the shoes you're wearing. Do you have a more straight on picture? The length uncuffed seems okay from what I see for flat shoes but I don't think it works with the ankle boot pairing. The ankle boots with the cuff feel better though.
femalefashionadvice,3din4f,crispyporkbelly,9,Thu Jul 16 19:45:11 2015 UTC,"Better cuffed, lose those boots w/ that outfit though"
femalefashionadvice,3din4f,sleezball,3,Thu Jul 16 20:11:15 2015 UTC,Thanks! Do you think loafers or something would work better?
femalefashionadvice,3din4f,crispyporkbelly,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:02:25 2015 UTC,I definitely think so! I think the boots look too chunky w/ those pants.
femalefashionadvice,3din4f,pparkaworks,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:57:24 2015 UTC,"I like the cuff a lot, but if you don't like it, then yes, the uncuffed length of the pants is too long for those boots.

femalefashionadvice,3din4f,vouloir-saisir,5,Thu Jul 16 20:03:35 2015 UTC,"Very simple and sleek. I'd prefer a pump with a slightly lower and rounder vamp, but that's just me being picky."
femalefashionadvice,3din4f,JessicaMilani,2,Thu Jul 16 20:19:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks. :)  By ""vamp"", do you mean platform? Mine is actually a tad lower than it would seem based on the pic. It's funny too, seeing as I generally prefer regular pointed-toe pumps."
femalefashionadvice,3din4f,vouloir-saisir,4,Thu Jul 16 22:32:55 2015 UTC,"No, I'm referring to a different part of the shoe. Though this graphic is in the context of ballet shoes, it does a good job of illustrating what a vamp is."
femalefashionadvice,3din4f,JessicaMilani,2,Thu Jul 16 22:55:08 2015 UTC,"Ah, so in essence you'd prefer a shoe with a more rounded toe and that doesn't go much higher than your foot itself. Understandable, especially seeing as I usually prefer regular pumps myself."

femalefashionadvice,3din4f,Iophobic,26,Thu Jul 16 17:05:38 2015 UTC,I'd get rid of the necklace or wear a simpler one since the dress has such a vibrant print. Everything else looks nice

femalefashionadvice,3din4f,JMeltzAway,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:30:13 2015 UTC,I think a lighter (both in color and weight) shoe would be better

femalefashionadvice,3din4f,nayapapaya,2,Fri Jul 17 15:34:41 2015 UTC,"So I recently bought these shorts and am wondering what tops to pair them with.   Truthfully, I was sort of overwhelmed by how cute the design is but in hindsight, I probably shouldn't have bought them because they're shorter than any shorts I've ever worn outside before and I'm not super comfortable with the length (mid-thigh). Still I just bought them and it's too late to return them (no longer in the US) so I want to at least try to make a go of it before I give up on them. I know they're not an obscene length or anything but the one time I wore them, I felt like everyone was staring at my bare legs and judging me (even though it was super hot). But I know that's all in my head so styling suggestions, please. I bought some plain tops - black, red, navy blue, dark grey. I wore it with the dark grey but it didn't quite work, probably because the grey was too dark."
femalefashionadvice,3din4f,petrakay,13,Thu Jul 16 16:36:16 2015 UTC,"First of all: nobody will judge you for mid-thigh shorts unless a) they are really judgmental in the first place or b) you are in a super conservative environment like a cathedral or some parts of the Middle East. I think they're adorable!   Navy or black would be my go-to, and I think your instinct is correct that a lighter grey would work better than a darker one. I'm also imagining a light neutral, like white, beige, or even chambray, and maybe some gold jewelry. Honestly the shorts are fairly neutral, so play around with them!"
femalefashionadvice,3din4f,nayapapaya,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:12:53 2015 UTC,Thank you! They are adorable. I tried them on in the hot pink too but it was a little too bright for me.  I have a light chambray shirt and tons of navy and black so I can definitely play around with a few looks. Thanks a bunch.
femalefashionadvice,3din4f,PrairieJack,5,Thu Jul 16 22:06:00 2015 UTC,"I would go with a reddish color, coral, rust/burnt orange, or mauve since the color of the short looks like a light olive color. Whatever color you wear on top make sure it's the same vibrancy as the green, like you said the gray might have been too dark."
femalefashionadvice,3din4f,nayapapaya,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:04:47 2015 UTC,Thanks for the suggestions. I do have a few red/reddish tops I can try it with.

femalefashionadvice,3din4f,PrairieJack,11,Fri Jul 17 01:21:23 2015 UTC,"I think it's the print and the tank top t-shirt look on the top half. I would dress it up with more sophisticated shoes, like maybe some wedges, strappy heels, or leather flats. A cardigan or blazer would also make it look a little older.

I love the jeans though! I might pair colored jeans like this with a black or grey top (they are reddish colored right? I'm horrible deciphering dark colors).   Possibly a black dressier shirt, like a black button down or a black v-neck top. I would try to stay away from anything jersey since you're already wearing jeans and that can look too casual for an interview. I would also unbutton the top button of the button down if you do plan on wearing it. In my opinion, having it buttoned that high is distracting, but that's just a personal opinion.  I would wear toms instead of the converse. It is an interview, so even though your style is more casual, you want to dress it up a little bit. If you have flats of some kind, that would work as well!  I hope this helps :)  edit: here's an example of a dressier version of a ""button up"". The material is what makes it seem dressier.

And I wouldn't be surprised if the simple style of the tote designates it as an everyday bag either. You don't have to pair non-casual or nicer clothes with leather bags! The material of the bag just makes it more durable and long lasting, that's all. If anything, the style and type of the bag is more indicative of how it should be used and what to pair it with. IMO totes are casual so wearing this with your casual clothes is perfect. Like I would pair this with navy pants and a white tee or jeans and an olive button down shirt."

Every nice party I went to was as a kid and I didn't care/get a choice of what to wear.      Now, I have to go to a family member's wedding. I always dressed pretty tomboyish my whole life and don't have any formalwear (no fancy dresses, shoes, or insane amounts of jewelry). I would like to rent something to save on cost but if the price is good I'm open to buying as well.      A little about my style - I dig the menswear look, my favorite store is Madewell. I do not own any heels and I'm not a fan of them. Dresses that I do have are casual and are more for comfort than for style. I do not shop frequently. I am petite and curvy and range from a size 2-6 depending on the item. I would like something classy, not too frilly, and comfortable (not skin tight). I have been working out a lot and feel much more comfortable in my skin now more than ever. I have thought about a nice jumpsuit perhaps but I haven't seen any that spark my interest. I appreciate advice from anyone!"

Might I suggest posting in the wedding thread or creating your own post? I think it would be helpful to get a budget and type of wedding you're going to (outdoors/indoors, level of fanciness etc.). If you're looking for a one time usage there's rent the runway. However if you're looking to reuse the items from the wedding then, depending on the wedding, you can get away with wearing dressy sandals/flats and a simple black or a solid color dress imo. You can try Asos, it's a nice catch-all place to look for dresses."

Its going to be an indoor wedding, I'm not sure about the fanciness level but I would probably rate it 7/10 on fanciness - its my cousin's wedding and there are going to be a lot of people so I think we will see a wide range of formality.

femalefashionadvice,3din4f,soulpocket,2,Fri Jul 17 14:54:29 2015 UTC,"Jumpsuits are a good option if you're just sort of easing into more formal/fancier wear. I personally think a more structured, solid color jumpsuit can work for weddings.  Here is an option that's pretty inexpensive so you won't feel like you wasted too much money. The shoulder detail makes it interesting since it is a solid color without a print. Pair it with flats (if you're comfortable in them) and a few bracelets for good measure. You look wedding-appropriate without being too girly.  If you do want to try a dress, however, shift and trapeze dresses are a good option for a tomboy. This dress is another more simple choice, but it can easily be dressed up with a nice necklace/clutch/earrings. It's breezy and flowy, so you won't feel constricted.   An a-line dress like this one is a classic cut and it's color scheme can go with a lot of different types of shoes. Since it's thicker material, it can be dressed up pretty easily."

femalefashionadvice,3din4f,rocket_sheep,2,Fri Jul 17 15:20:53 2015 UTC,"the pieces themselves IMO are well chosen. There are two things which i find a little visually distracting   the top is kind of sheer. it´s still perfectly modest but you can see the dark of the jeans up to the waist beneath it. I see a lot of people doing that, so maybe it´s just personal taste but I don´t like the effect and i think that dark showing beneath the sheer is almost always unflattering. Maybe try tucked in, just to check? Or the front fold, particularly if you got a narrow-medium belt with a cool toned buckle which will look good with the ornaments in the neckline. the jeans are bulging at the ankles, both on the first and last pick, are they maybe too long? Any chance folding might work? Other  jeans?"
femalefashionadvice,3din4f,zenquaker,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:20:40 2015 UTC,"Great feedback, thank you! I agree with the sheerness of the shirt showing through to the pants, but it's definitely extremely common here in the desert where minimal fabrics are the name of the game. So while it's something I would ideally not have, it's definitely not something that would catch any attention here.  While I'm hunting for earrings, I'm going to see if I can find a silver belt. It's something I've been meaning to add to my wardrobe anyway, as my favorite/nicest purse is silver leather and I generally tend towards silver accessories. Again, tucking is my greatest fashion struggle, but I'll give it a try. I just want to make sure it's not something I'm fussing with all night, since that wildly detracts from the point of a date. :P  Regarding the jeans, this is the first ever pair that have been long enough, fit in the thighs, and don't gap at all in the waist. I don't think they're too long, but I honestly never even considered it in light of the other criteria. Pants are the bane of my existence. I think the bunching is partly that the angle of the shoe is pretty steep (I've never had a date tall and well dressed enough for me to wear heels before!!), and partly that they needed a wash to shrink them back up a bit (done). I have more jegging-cut jeans, but I feel that the slightly looser ankles on these strike a nice interim between jegging and wider cuts. Just personal preference. I find that the more fitted ankle jeans are stretchier and thinner, so they don't stay up as well or look as nice.  Thank you so much again for your feedback!"

I saw that you like the French wardrobe philosophy and it looks like you're off to a great start with your thoughts on it.  I think the main problem with this fit is the tshirt. I understand that it's casual Friday, but graphic tees, especially crew neck ones, often look juvenile and too casual. I think a small v-neck would look great. I'd also wear a slightly shorter t. Right now, your torso looks very long, making your legs look short. If you can find a shorter t, great! If not, you can try tucking it in. Right now, the tee might look odd tucked in because it's so casual.  The pants look like they fit you well. I think you could even go with more tapered pants if you'd like, and maybe even slightly cropped ankle-length ones. The shoes are great!"
