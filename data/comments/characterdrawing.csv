You've got this guy (gal?) in a really static pose, however, and I would so love seeing him/her in action. Be sure to use C and S curves in the line of action, too. It'll make the pose feel more fluid, and organic looking, and keep him/her from looking too stiff. Highly recommend studying up on facial proportions and anatomy, too. It'll only make your work that much more awesome. Good work, but keep at it. You're almost there."
characterdrawing,3dp2j3,TwoLetters,3,Sat Jul 18 05:29:32 2015 UTC,"Agreed, all the details look great, but it could look a lot more dynamic.

You'll be surprised how much more interesting your work becomes, both to look at, and do, once you start posing your characters.

Got a couple of questions for ya though, for the clothes when you say 'noble' clothes do you mean the PH definition which is 'tons of jewellery' or do you just want something that looks expensive and badass? Do you want any additional armor other than chest, like a shoulder/helmet for example? What kind of hair if any does he have? And for the squire I assume by the lack of description that you're happy with anything so long as it's a comically small guy?     Lastly I tend to draw anime in 1 of 2 ways, either  with no lines like this http://imgur.com/gallery/IMzg5OW or with lines like this http://imgur.com/gallery/bEQx74y I can also do cell shaded if you prefer rather than the 'painted' effect, what would you prefer?"
characterdrawing,3dnu3f,Rothgir,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:59:47 2015 UTC,"Noble clothing might be a bit too generous of a description. He is a knight basically, so practical clothing but it looks expensive if that makes any sense. Annnnnd I changed armor last session so instead of a mithril breast plate I am in a rhino hide breast plate basically. He doesnt have any hair, he has the head of a dragon. Hes half dragon basically as a dragonborn, there are lots of images you could probably get an idea from. On his shoulders he has a green cape that is purple on the inside. (its for stats not style haha) so you could match it with the clothing. Yea for squire he is a french guy that carries my stuff around. He is comically small with all my stuff due to the size of it not just that he is small. He is well traveled so not too dainty. For art styles I like the first better :D    Thanks a BUNCH for doing this :D"
characterdrawing,3dnu3f,Rothgir,2,Mon Jul 20 02:15:30 2015 UTC,"Yep I get what you mean with the clothing. So is he full dragonborn then? Like head, wings, tail, feet and all?

I've never played as a warlock or played in a party with warlocks, so I have no idea what pact of the blade is, any details of what that means/what effect it would have on the axe would be great!

Pact of the blade let's the Warlock summon a weapon from extra dimensional space. It can take the shape of pretty much whatever the player wants. I figure since my character's patron (unknown to him) is a devil. The weapon should be a 1H axe, and be slightly demonic in appearance. But I really defer the look to you."

I truly need this because, if I'm going to continue writing books properly, I should know his appearance. If you're alright with helping me out, here's his description:   Neck-length, wavy, chocolate colored hair and a smooth stubble (Covering sideburns, chin, lips and the upper neck below the jaw) but nothing heavy.  Light olive skin, barrel-chested, 5'9"", 160lbs and an athletic physique (On level with daily manual labor). Hard jawline (Jensen Ackles for reference), oval face shape, large hunter-green eyes (Adding to friendliness), long nose (He's Mediterranean), slightly open lips, straight eyebrows and Size 9 foot (USA & Canada measure). Relaxed stance, friendly expression and his eyebrows are lined up as if he's curiously observing. Brown hiking boots, dirty dark green cargo pants and white v-neck t-shirt. Grey wolf ears are slightly sticking out from under his hair instead of round lobes; they're not long and are mostly matted with hair. If his teeth are showing, his upper canines are fangs that match the rest of his teeth and don't stick out of his mouth. His finger nails are solid white instead of showing any pink like regular people; they're almost pointed but it's nothing significant."

characterdrawing,3bv2eb,actuallydidthistoo,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:01:31 2015 UTC,Here's my first run at your character. I'm still working on it I guess although if you're happy with this drawing you're more than welcome to keep it. It was just a little bit tough actually trying to make the creature look like a direwolf rather than just a smaller dragon.   I took some liberties. Anyway hope you like it!

characterdrawing,3atn81,lordsenneian,7,Tue Jun 23 12:30:16 2015 UTC,"Okay, that's cool - you've outdone yourself."
characterdrawing,3atn81,fuseboy,5,Tue Jun 23 14:02:22 2015 UTC,Thanks. That means a lot coming from an artist as talented as yourself. I've been admiring your work on here for awhile.

characterdrawing,3atn81,technically_art,5,Tue Jun 23 15:56:09 2015 UTC,Thank you! This is exactly how I envisioned the character. It's awesome that you incorporated the +1 whip and the flute :)
characterdrawing,3atn81,technically_art,5,Tue Jun 23 20:22:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah the long stick is het unstrung bow, if that wasn't apparent. I'm Glad you like it, she's a cool character."

characterdrawing,3atn81,SFW_jones,4,Tue Jun 23 14:18:16 2015 UTC,She looks like a badass fantasy version of Starbuck! Super cool
characterdrawing,3atn81,bactchan,2,Tue Jun 23 17:56:08 2015 UTC,Damn good.
characterdrawing,3atn81,akidneythief,2,Tue Jun 23 17:06:55 2015 UTC,"Dude, that's pretty boss. I get kind of a Samus Aran feel off her."
characterdrawing,3atn81,thevillawolf,2,Tue Jun 23 17:25:52 2015 UTC,"More art make here. Me upvote, yes. Much amaze."
characterdrawing,3atn81,danceswithronin,2,Tue Jun 23 17:50:22 2015 UTC,Wow! I love the art style. Definitely badass.
characterdrawing,3atn81,Lysus,2,Tue Jun 23 18:47:14 2015 UTC,This is so amazing. The lighting on her face is just killer.
characterdrawing,3atn81,lesser_futhark,4,Tue Jun 23 19:30:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I've been working on lighting characters differently and trying to streamline my painting techniques to avoid muddiness. This one came out pretty good, but I think it actually needed more work. I was dead tired at 5am and decided it was post-worthy and so I called it a night."
characterdrawing,3atn81,HeyThereSport,2,Tue Jun 23 20:40:46 2015 UTC,This is phenomenal.
characterdrawing,3atn81,nillic,-1,Wed Jun 24 13:28:17 2015 UTC,Wearing covering clothes? Check.  Excellent art direction? Check.  No obvious oversexualizations? Ch...wait. What's that?  HAY GUISE SHE HIAS POINTY TITTIES  sighs
characterdrawing,3atn81,nillic,8,Tue Jun 23 17:17:30 2015 UTC,"They're not that pointy though, they're just lit from below. It's an optical illusions."
characterdrawing,3atn81,Isakk86,4,Tue Jun 23 17:20:12 2015 UTC,I figured it was just the way the leather would be folded.
characterdrawing,3atn81,LouDraws,0,Tue Jun 23 18:25:07 2015 UTC,There's no reason for any distinction in her breasts though. It's simply bad armor design

characterdrawing,3av00g,edgesonlpr,3,Tue Jun 23 18:51:57 2015 UTC,"Wow, interesting character. I did a dwarf made of stone once. I might take a swing at this if I get some time. I hope others give it a go as well. I'd like to see different people's take on this. Is there any more descriptive details you'd like or are you leaving most of it to the artists?"
characterdrawing,3av00g,lordsenneian,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:28:54 2015 UTC,"I was going to leave most of it up to the artist, Since this would be a ""new"" body for the character I wasn't planning on bringing any of his features into it. I would however prefer he be holding a big two-handed hammer if he has a weapon at all.  [Edit: Nice stone dwarf btw. I really like your style. I also like how his beard is moss / algae. ]"
characterdrawing,3av00g,lordsenneian,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:30:37 2015 UTC,"Ok, I got something really good coming your way but I had to leave home for the end of the week. I'll have the finished piece up early next week. I think you'll dig it."
characterdrawing,3av00g,A-Type_Person,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:35:06 2015 UTC,Awesome. Im excited to see what you came up with.
