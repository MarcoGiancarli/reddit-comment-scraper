sanantonio,3e3uds,nantucketer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:17:44 2015 UTC,what time are the games normally? how long is the season? do you need a specific position?
sanantonio,3e3uds,lenaw792,0,Tue Jul 21 22:23:54 2015 UTC,The games will be scheduled to begin anytime between 6:30 and 9:30 on Friday nights. The games will be held at the Mainland Sports Complex. The season is at least 6 games with the possibility of playoffs. It is my understanding that we can take any position.
sanantonio,3e2dzw,rumbrave55,16,Tue Jul 21 12:49:33 2015 UTC,"What a bummer. I hope they're able to recover from it quickly.   Too many bands are subjects of theft in San Antonio. We complain about not having a good music scene, but what band would want to play here knowing that their friends gear got stolen??"
sanantonio,3e2dzw,coastlines,5,Tue Jul 21 13:06:23 2015 UTC,This isn't a San Antonio problem.  It's a small band problem.  I vaguely follow a bunch of Red Dirt bands on Facebook and several have reported equipment theft (either theirs or someone they know).  None of those thefts have been here; several of them haven't been in Texas.  It's a pretty widespread problem.
sanantonio,3e2dzw,Grave_Girl,6,Tue Jul 21 18:31:35 2015 UTC,"Yep. The exact same thing happens all the time in Austin, and they get tons of acts San Antonio doesn't get."

sanantonio,3e3drt,sfoxy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:47:52 2015 UTC,Civic = pain in the ass. 120 is a good price. Prices don't really fluctuate unless your getting ripped off. Refurbished units could save you about 20% but I wouldn't go that route. I always check rockauto.com to get an idea on how much parts cost.   Edit: make sure you know it's the starter. I thought my starter was bad and really it was a bad battery connection. I replaced the $2 connector and cleaned the battery. Best to let a mechanic diagnose. I got lucky because I decided just to go the cheapest route first.

They have good benefits and you can live a good life if you manage your finances correctly. There are research facilities that use animals as subjects for their products and, as unpopular as these facilities are, they need people to take care of the animals. Also, there is Tyson Foods, BPI, Hilshire Farms, etc. who need knowledgable individuals in their animal procurement department. These corporate jobs pay very well with ample room to move up the ladder."

Parking sucks, but you can't have it all. :) I can rattle of tons of places to eat around town, but that's probably my favorite by far. Feel free to PM me for specific food questions. The Pearl has lots of great stuff! There's also a path by the riverwalk that starts from that area which is quite nice.  As for locations, downtown is a bit touristy so I'd suggest you see the river, but eat somewhere else. Definitely try to do the boat tour. The Alamo is cool, but honestly the other missions are way cooler. Check them out! http://www.nps.gov/saan/planyourvisit/index.htm  Outside of that, if you have any questions, fire away!"

I love the Friendly Spot. Across the street is a great place to try some Texas BBQ called B&D Icehouse. I've never been disappointed by their food. That area is full of good things to eat and a local brewery: Freetail. Alamo Street Eat is a food truck park with some decent trucks. Rosario's is one of my favorite Mexican food joints with some solid Margarita options. Bliss, La Frite and Feast are a little more pricey but amazing options. Then a short drive or decent walk there is Blue Star Arts Complex with the Bluestar Brewpub. Stella there has some of my favorite pizza. 1919 under street level has one of the most impressive whisky selections I've seen in town or elsewhere. If you're back downtown closer to the hotel Soho is a great place to grab a great cocktail. Houston street is littered in fantastic albeit expensive places. Bohanon's has steaks that are second to nothing I have had and a great bar.The Last Word next door has some funky but delicious cocktails. Luke has great cajun dishes. If you want you can also take the river taxi, or drive up the Pearl Brewery. There is La Gloria for Mexican bar food, think tacos and queso fondito. Their chicharon quesadilla is the right amount of grease and guilt for post drink snacking. The Granary Cue and Brew in that area makes some good beers and BBQ. These are all places I've been and go back too. I'm not really informed on current events but I love good Food and Drink."

sanantonio,3dymfd,lenaw792,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:26:48 2015 UTC,this is awesome! I know the servers have fun with this and I imagine it sparks conversation in their shifts and probably throughout the week. I'd definitely be interested in a flash mob evening during week days.
sanantonio,3dymfd,buttercult,-6,Mon Jul 20 17:20:21 2015 UTC,It's pretty funny.  The manager at Las Ramblas actually came out to meet me because he thought that it was pretty good and thought that maybe it was one of his college friends messing with him.  I am sure that the servers at some of the places are still talking about it.  The interesting thing is that I actually have always gotten MUCH better service from any restaurants that play along with my requests.
sanantonio,3dymfd,buttercult,3,Mon Jul 20 18:09:41 2015 UTC,"Okay, just to clarify...  The prank you are trying to pull on your girlfriend is that a waiter finds her attractive and is also forbidden to look you in the eyes?  And the joke here is ""haha I paid him to pretend he was sexually attracted to you and give you compliments HAHA!""  Do I have this right?  Why would you do something like that to her?  That's humiliating and rude and fucking weird. I hope she takes it seriously and actually gives him her number because dude... no. just, no.   Mija, if you are reading this PM me and let's talk about why you're still dating this guy and why your self esteem is so low.  If you need to go shopping, a gym buddy, makeup/hair advice or just need someone tell you that you can do better than a boyfriend who would pay a waiter to humiliate you, whatever you need girl, I'm here for you."
sanantonio,3dymfd,TheAmishChicken,-3,Mon Jul 20 19:51:54 2015 UTC,"Interesting point, but no, that is not the intended joke.  I had thought that it would be funny because it would make her feel shocked at the waiters boldness and when she says ""did you see that"" I would act oblivious.  Luckily, I do know her well, and I am sure that she would think that it was funny and not humiliating whatsoever.  It's not a play on her self esteem at all."
sanantonio,3dymfd,AshesTree,-3,Mon Jul 20 20:06:54 2015 UTC,"Ok, yeah, I don't mean like some stupid synchronized dance, so maybe the term ""flash mob"" is not right, but when one table messes with a server, it can be funny for them and the guests, but if there is something interesting going on all over the restaurant, it's fun for everyone."

Very inconsiderate."
sanantonio,3dyfyy,francesm96,11,Mon Jul 20 15:40:47 2015 UTC,You are a college student so you are automatically exempt from serving on a jury. Bring proof you are a student and tell them as soon as you get there.
sanantonio,3dyfyy,glasnostic,3,Mon Jul 20 15:45:46 2015 UTC,"http://www.bexar.org/374/Exemptions  For the OP, glasnostic has it exactly right.  See the 4th bullet point.  Bring proof of your college enrollment.  I'm not sure what they accept as proof, but it does not hurt to bring multiple things.  Your college ID may be all you need, but additional proof cannot hurt.  You show up for your call exactly as normal.  Very shortly after they let everyone into the big waiting room they open up a window and start processing requests for exemptions from the linked list.  They have to do these first, so they know who is left to put into jury pools.  Go get in line when they are doing this, and in theory you should be done and out of there within a couple of hours at most."
sanantonio,3dyfyy,TexasAndroid,2,Mon Jul 20 17:00:40 2015 UTC,"I actually tried to get on a jury because I was curious about all of that and it was a murder trial and once they got me on the stand for the two lawyers to start questioning me, it came up that I was a student and they simply wouldn't take me. They were a little befuddled as to why I hadn't exempted myself already, and I'm sure quite surprised that I actually wanted to be on a jury."
sanantonio,3dyfyy,glasnostic,3,Mon Jul 20 17:22:48 2015 UTC,"Back in the 90s I was the foreman on a murder trial.  It was quite interesting.  I've been called 3 times since (twice Bexar county, once federal), and not ended up on a jury since then."

sanantonio,3dyfyy,itsjustgish,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:32:15 2015 UTC,"Yep.  As I understand it, there are four entities in Bexar county that conduct jury trials, but three of the four run their jury pools through the county.  So calls to Bexar county jury duty can end you up on a jury for the county, or the city or the state.    The federal government, OTOH, runs it's own jury system, totally independently of the county system."

Of course you can google best Mexican restaurants in town. Also don't forget BBQ in Lockhart and German food in Fredericksburg.

Camp Bow Wow and Lucy's are both places I wouldn't recommend.  Neither would I recommend Becker Animal Hospital. Rob Cary might be a good choice, but I haven't had interactions with them yet."

sanantonio,3dw39r,Shad0wembrace,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:49:48 2015 UTC,"Which is weird since they have such a low rate of turnover. I've seen three or four new faces in two years.   Their Customer Service skills are out of this world good. The staff has their own nickname for my dog. They remember who she's played with during previous visits and one of the girls remembers how much food she gets during her stays. Hell, they even know my phone number when I call to check up on my dog or make a reservation. I would say the opinion on customer service is inaccurate.   As an actual customer of Bow Wow, my dog has never had any incidents while boarding or going for daycare. I think in general, if a dog is trained (to deal with people and other dogs) and well socialized they will be just fine. Just like regular child care, things will unexpectedly happen or dogs may get sick, it's how the pet parent chooses to over or under react."

The construction on I-35 going north from Georgetown to Waco seems to bother me more now than getting stuck in Austin for traffic.    I've been in Boston to visit family this past week and it really does grasp my brain on how I can literally travel an hour and be in another state.

sanantonio,3du1sp,suprlonghorn,6,Sun Jul 19 13:46:35 2015 UTC,"I've done some research on this issue.  What I learned is that the softeners from big box stores are cheap, but they must be replaced every few years.   You can buy a unit that costs more up front, but will last longer and can be repaired rather than replaced.  That being said, Culligan is very expensive, and their proprietary units don't really perform better. You'd be better off hiring a plumber who can order a standard model and install it for you.  I recently had Jay Gomez from Alamo Discount Water Systems come and service my unit-- he replaced the beads for a couple of hundred bucks when other companies wanted me to buy a whole new unit for big bucks. He seemed really honest and knowledgeable, and I would highly recommend his services. I dug out his card-- here's the deets: (210) 639-6081; [website](www.alamodiscountwatersystems.com)."
sanantonio,3du1sp,sam2wi,3,Sun Jul 19 15:25:10 2015 UTC,"heyo! we just moved here from the midwest about a month ago. ive never needed a water softener, so i literally know nothing about them. alamo water softeners came by a few times, but i was pretty set on going to lowes and doing it myself. eventually i caved and we went with AWS, no regrets, they're incredible. everyone else is way over priced."
sanantonio,3du1sp,quarteritalian,2,Sun Jul 19 16:02:18 2015 UTC,"I second Alamo Water Softeners. I did a ton of research online and found that the most important part of a water softener is the valve and there are two companies who make the most reliable valves. AWS uses one of them. The service was great, the price is reasonable compared to a lot of companies I've seen the the unit works great so far after two years. Another benefit is that the medium they use doesn't make the water ""feel"" very soft."

sanantonio,3du1sp,XmockdefenseX,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:14:44 2015 UTC,"I had mine installed maybe a couple months ago from Lowe's. It's expensive, but well worth the money imo. Lifetime parts warranty and the warranty is transferable. They come out and do all the installation themselves, free of charge. They also added a couple more outside lines straight from the main and gave me a control all kill switch for the water system inside. My parents live in Kerrville and they fill up containers of our water when they stop by. Not to mention the way your hair feels after a long shower with warm, great, clean water. I'd recommend it to anyone."

sanantonio,3du1sp,tonyled,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:56:00 2015 UTC,"After testing our well water and finding it at 10gpg and getting an estimate on a larger repairable unit (where the guy was genuinely impressed with our water quality) we ultimately decided to get the same 44k unit at Lowes and revisit the more expensive units down the road after seeing how well this one performs and lasts.  We were already plumbed so once I got the right parts & hoses and preassembed everything for cutting in, it only took about a half hour to install it. All said and done, maybe an hour total. If you are already plumbed - do it yourself."
sanantonio,3du1sp,cyvaquero,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:06:25 2015 UTC,"I would recommend buying one and having a plumber install it. They're not particularly hard but if you've never plumbed or welded, which isn't always needed, then I wouldn't recommend it. I replaced my parents awhile back and it was not too bad. I think home depot has a standard system that they use called rainsoft or something. I'm sure Lowes has a similar program. I've never heard of the big box units being any better or worse than what a plumber will get you. It's really more about maintenance. Make sure the salt is not caking on the inside and you could always use potassium pellets to help with that.  Edit: DO NOT GO WITH KINETICO! I know someone who did and they didn't properly install the discharge line which led to flooding in the attic causing a ceiling collapse and ultimately a wall replacement."

The technician adjusted it to overuse salt during a service call.)  The Culligan gave out earlier this year. I priced a Kinetico and found it to be double what I had paid for the Culligan.  Ended up going with this place out of New Braunfels and paid less than I did for the Culligan unit. The owner does the installations and he really knows his stuff.

If you're still downtown, I'd recommend taking a Via trolley to Southtown or the Pearl Brewery district (if you like fancy hipster stuff). Being in S.A. though, I wouldn't leave until you've ate some authentic Mexican food! Many great places are near the downtown area."

Augie's has awesome ribs, but for some reason the ladies' room at the one on Broadway doesn't have any way to get privacy.  (Like, the regular stall doesn't have a lock on the door.  The handicapped stall doesn't even have a door; it has a shower curtain.)  So that's questionable.  The Smokehouse (formerly Bob's Smokehouse) down on the south side at Rigsby & Roland is really good too."

sanantonio,3dmi0v,glasnostic,7,Fri Jul 17 13:55:32 2015 UTC,"I think water restrictions should be in place year round as it will soften the blow in the drought times.  I agree with /u/glasnostic about the commercial properties being a big water waster.  So many times do I see them running their sprinklers even during storms.    The interesting one to me is the amount of breweries that have popped up in SA in the past few years.  I do welcome them as putting more choices on the shelves as long as they can prove their efficiency in their water use.  Then there is Niagara, a Cali based water bottling company, that will be setting up shop in Seguin to pull water out of Carrizo Springs.  I think that was a pretty stupid move and am sure someone had their pockets lined in the deal.  They touted job creation for the plant, but will only be creating dozens of jobs that will be minimum wage, which is why SA rejected their bid to set up shop around Brooks city base.   And this does affect SA as SAWS does pull water from Carrizo Springs as well.  TLDR - Ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure - Ben Franklin"

Unfortunately, what you are seeing on Reddit is just the tip of the iceberg.  Animals do grow up and are no longer cute and people don't understand the responsibility required when they obtain pets.  Also not highlighted are the amount of dogs left in backyards that get no attention and a percentage of those that are just plain neglected.  I've witnessed first hand (multiple times!) people moving out of their rental house and leaving their dog behind.    Queue Sarah McLaughlin song... people suck."
sanantonio,3dlkp6,VileContext,6,Fri Jul 17 15:51:53 2015 UTC,"The big problem is spaying and neutering. Lots of folks don't fix their animals and it causes a huge overpopulation problem. Ergo, responsible dog people, like the shelter and rescue system, are overwhelmed.   I would say, as well, encourage friends looking for dogs to start at No-Kill shelters like San Antonio Pets Alive on Paul Jolly, or the Humane Society on Fredericksberg.  Unlike buying some puppy, you can actually meet a lot of dogs and see which one has the personality for you. A huge advantage over buying pups!  In short: Spay and neuter, and adopt not shop!"
sanantonio,3dlkp6,sankgreall,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:38:52 2015 UTC,"That's the main problem.   I don't think it's and veterinarian's fault for charging what they do to spay or neuter as long as it's reasonable.   But being able to afford to do it kind of puts the screws to the pet owner. Especially, with the economic diversity that is in our city.   The problem is complex and I know there are people trying to fix it. But If the officials that are trying to fix it aren't getting it done I think we should try and help the people that we personally know to get their pets spayed or neutered.   I think that came across as ""if you can, help pick up the slack"". That's how I meant it.   Don't put yourself out if it's a burden and you don't have to make it your life. But even helping one person a year would cut down a lot over time.   I'm going to think about this for a couple of days and suggest something that might be realistically implementable on a grass roots level."
sanantonio,3dlkp6,sankgreall,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:36:58 2015 UTC,"Spaying and neutering from low-cost operations that specialize runs about $25.

If you can run them over to a vet at the Petsmart by the Lowe's near the corner of 90 and 151, they can scan for a microchip for free. If one doesn't have a microchip, the other probably doesn't. From there, reach out to P.A.S.S. San Antonio, and craigslist, and see if anyone comes looking for them.   The animal shelter is close, right by the food bank, and even if you can foster, take them over and get them in the system for the 3-day stray hold. Afterwards, you can take them back for foster, and that way the city vet will look them over and make sure they're healthy and up to date on shots."

If he was truly anti slavery to the extent that he recognized it as the inherent evil that it is, he would not have led an army who were fanatically devoted to preserving it.   Robert E. Lee's real world complexity is not that he truly believed slavery was evil and wrong, but that he knew giving lip service to anti slavery ideology while opposing that ideology with every action he took on the battlefield was the best way to preserve his legacy in the aftermath of his ignominious defeat.

He was a racist, and he was defending a racist society, but he believed slavery to be evil.  He believed whites were culturally and technologically superior, not necessarily innately superior - and his writing in that same link bears that out.

He might have disagreed with slavery personally, but he sure as hell wanted to keep it around. I don't get why that's a hard concept for people to get. Actions speak louder than words, and to many Robert E Lee is a symbol that they were once property"
sanantonio,3dio2d,beer_goblin,3,Fri Jul 17 16:33:35 2015 UTC,"Lee was defending his homeland and he had a very long career in the military. To say he was ""defending slavery only"" is dishonest to a fault."
sanantonio,3dio2d,Bejeweled_Bird,0,Thu Jul 16 23:30:46 2015 UTC,"It's also dishonest to say that he was an honorable man when the self declared primary intention of secession on the part of the southern states was to preserve the right of those states to own slaves, and he agreed to not just fight for but lead such a cause. We musn't whitewash history by honoring a man who led an army in fighting for an inherently evil cause.   The political winds have not favored the anti confederate symbolism movement until recently because of the post war reconstruction legacy that taught everyone to believe that both sides in the conflict were noble, divided brothers. Recent events have put on full display the continuing legacy of the confederacy and allowed these changes to slowly take place. Just as in world war ii, one side was fighting to preserve an institution that is morally untenable, and this should never be forgotten, lest anyone believe that the cause of the south or its generals was ethically defensible. It's not. Robert e. Lee should be left in history books, not in places of honor. Nobody would name a school after Erwin rommel or Herman goring. Likewise, no school should be named after Robert e. Lee."

Kind of as a ""thank you"" for preventing bad product from being accidentally sold and eaten.  When I worked at HEB, we would have customers troll the shelves for expired product. I gave away $500 worth of items once because the woman found so many expired items on the shelves. It is most common for refrigerated foods, but happens occasionally on dry goods.   Usually products sell before their expiration date, but sometimes stockers/vendors don't catch expired items on the floor. Just something to consider when shopping at HEB!  Also, HEB backs their products 100%. (Hill Country Fare brand, HEB brand, Central Market Brand). Take the box in, and they will give you a refund or replacement no questions asked. The product can be unopened, or consumed completely. If you decide you are unsatisfied, they will take care of you."
sanantonio,3dh4ta,holed-up,5,Thu Jul 16 17:10:57 2015 UTC,I think they stopped doing that.

sanantonio,3dgkyn,Cantkillmek,-1,Fri Jul 17 00:00:09 2015 UTC,"Oh if only...   I get discounted tickets because my bf's dad works in radio and he gets tickets through the companies they advertise for. You really have to have an ""in"" or know a guy who does. Sorry this wasn't the answer you were looking for! Try coupons online, or I know our HEB'S will sell tickets, but I don't know at what price compared to tickets at the door. If you know someone with a season pass ask about the coupons included with that. And I think coke cans can somehow get you $10 off or something like that. I don't know, Google it! Also consider going to sea world. They have roller coasters, animals, and a Waterpark. Plus you can pet dolphins! (Uh awesome) Sea world I think is a better use of that kind of money. Hope you enjoy your visit here in SA! Feel free to Message me if you have any more questions about what san antonio has to offer. Been living here for 17 years."

sanantonio,3dgkyn,Cantkillmek,2,Thu Jul 16 09:11:00 2015 UTC,"I'm not huge on coasters and my boyfriend HATES them so for us it's just a Waterpark, shows, and carnival games. SeaWorld is better for our situation and families with smaller kids who can't ride rides due to height. I'm not say 6 flags is bad, I'm saying SeaWorld is another option to consider. So is shlitterbahn, or another water park. It depends on the family's wants from a park."
sanantonio,3dgkyn,Injectingspores,2,Thu Jul 16 14:14:26 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  I actually loveeee Sea World, but bought a pass to Six Flags this year because I've never been and I've been missing coasters."

sanantonio,3ddiga,StabAntonio,4,Wed Jul 15 12:36:49 2015 UTC,It is noteworthy that the city has invited her to serve on the committee to rewrite the ordinance that she was ticketed for violating!   Speculation I heard on the radio this morning is that this move has Sheryl Sculley's fingerprints all over it. Those of you who grumble that Sculley is overpaid should keep in mind that she likely helps keep the city from stepping on its own tail more often than any of us will ever know.
sanantonio,3ddiga,excoriator,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:17:45 2015 UTC,"Actually - all is not peaches and cream and Sculley still needs a pay cut.  What really happened is the city offered Chef Cheever a horrible plea deal which she rejected, requesting trial by jury. A day or so later her attorney gave the city an advance copy of a federal law suit they will file if the ordinance isn't changed. Two hours later, the city withdrew the charges. Chef Cheever has been lobbying the city to fix policies and ordinances regarding the homeless for many years now and takes COSA's sudden willingness to listen and this forming of a committee as the fig leaf it is. The federal suit will be filed if COSA doesn't take measures to change the ordinance Cheever was charged under ASAP.  So not so noteworthy and COSA continues to step on its dick."

Any how, this is a huge problem for San Antonio, because the income diversity in the town is absolutely terrible. The median income is greatly skewed from the few very very wealthy people we have.   Ways to fix this for San Antonio? - Increase urban core development and increase density of housing around it. - Better public transit systems to get people in/out of the urban core.  Two very basic things a large city such as San Antonio needs. Want to know why the Pearl/Broadway is so expensive? Because all of those apartments are sold out. People want to live there because it's a nice area with conveniences all around it. Since the actual units available in that area are extremely scarce, the cost will not budge. The more units that get built, the more that actively go into rotation of being available, the cheaper the cost will eventually get. Supply and demand, yo."

sanantonio,3d9ehh,Robdiesel_dot_com,10,Tue Jul 14 22:23:30 2015 UTC,I posted this because many of my peers have been asking me recently to help them find a place to rent. Many are quite surprised to see how much rent has gone up over the years. Most of my friends are getting advice from friends or family that rented 3-5 years ago. But at 10%-20% increase each year it is a new market for those seeking a place to rent today.  I am not sure what the solution is but hopefully this will help people who are looking to move out of the house soon.
sanantonio,3d9ehh,RS7JR,3,Tue Jul 14 15:54:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I recently decided to look into renting a spot off of Hausman where they are building an entire subdivision of homes that will be for rent only (kinda like an apartment complex but instead with small modular homes) and the cheapest rent was $2300.  I couldn't believe my eyes.  For those prices I might as well move back to L.A.  I remember a time in San Antonio where you had a great selection of rental properties under $1000 for rent.  Those days seem to be long gone."
sanantonio,3d9ehh,MrTX,6,Tue Jul 14 16:03:21 2015 UTC,That area off of Hausman is expensive as hell now anyway because of demand from students at UTSA needing housing. I found a lot of houses in the 3 bedroom size that were around 1000 in parts of town closer to the I10/410 area
sanantonio,3d9ehh,RS7JR,5,Tue Jul 14 17:37:43 2015 UTC,"True.  I'm currently paying $1050 for a 1900 sq ft home with 3 bed / 2 bath in the greater northwest area (the newer mid-90's part of dover ridge).

Great community facilities (if you pay your HOA dues) and plenty of good public schools all around."

They are ALWAYS expensive."
sanantonio,3d9ehh,RS7JR,8,Tue Jul 14 17:14:44 2015 UTC,"Well I'm from L.A. so I'm well aware of what condos are but these are a little different because they are full size homes with full size yards.  They don't have the typical condo in San Antonio look with the really narrow layout and single car garages.  They look just like brand new full size new leaf homes.  I guess it's the same idea though. The website advertises them as homes as well.  Guess it's all about marketing though.  And yeah, I would expect something like that to be expensive but not over double the average rent in San Antonio."

It's on the little stretch of hausman between prue rd and loop 1604.  Pretty much right in the middle of that section across the street from an apartment complex entrance (I think the apartments are called hidden meadow or something like that).

I can't buy yet due to a foreclosure in 2012. What people are asking for is crazy these days. Sure, it's NOT an apartment and you get a yard, (sometimes) a garage, no common walls with neighbors, etc. but the premium for that is really outrageous."
sanantonio,3d9ehh,Xkot,2,Tue Jul 14 18:57:06 2015 UTC,"Starting point for a good area is around $1,200 a month. You can find stuff under $1000 but it will have a catch to it. Shared wall, no yard, 2 bedrooms, really old, or in. Bad side of town."

sanantonio,3d9ehh,NerosNeptune,3,Wed Jul 15 04:25:40 2015 UTC,"I own a new-ish home that's about 2700sq ft in a very safe blue collar neighborhood in Converse. We rent it out for $300/mo less than I pay on the mortgage per month because few San Antonians seem to be willing to live in non-white / non-downtown neighborhoods.  This is a hugely segregated city, despite the seeming lack of racial tension on the surface. When I lived in Florida there was more overt racism but white and black people lived together in most areas. In San Antonio there is hardly any acknowledged racism but my white friends assumed I was moving into a war zone because my neighbors on Converse were black or latino. When I bought the house around 2008 I'd compare published crime data in Converse to their homes in Stone Oak and my neighborhood was always lower. Didn't matter - they'd act paranoid about the safety of parking in my driveway and other stupid shit.   TL;DR rent is affordable in this area if you're not afraid of brown people."
sanantonio,3d9ehh,AshesTree,12,Wed Jul 15 04:31:48 2015 UTC,There is no shortage of available rental housing in San Antonio. There might just be a disconnect between what millennials can afford and where they think they deserve to live.

The only problem I can imagine is if people are refusing to live anywhere other than a brand new building in an area like the Pearl?

The average household income is $42,000 a year and can only afford $1180 to keep their living expenses under 1/3 of their income."
sanantonio,3d9ehh,MindoverMattR,5,Fri Jul 17 17:05:36 2015 UTC,"A quick search on Sabor shows 189 homes people can rent out for $1000 or less. Hundreds more if they're willing to commute. Thousands more to choose from if you include apartments. My point is that affordable housing IS available. But people have a very hard time distinguishing between needs and wants, essentially pricing themselves out of the market.  Same argument with jobs. There is absolutely no shortage of jobs here in San Antonio but a lot of people(not just millennials, but gen x, and b.boomers as well) would rather stay unemployed than take on a job that they think is way beneath them.  I think its simple, you live where you can afford.  Here's one solution, lets take realtors out of the equation and bring the market price down 6% :)"

sanantonio,3d9ehh,sailirish7,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:35:13 2015 UTC,"Removing a realtor from the equation is not going to lower anything. When a home is sold you hope to price it at the maximum someone is willing to pay, not at the price you are wanting to make.   For instance,  If I have home valued at $100,000 and hope to gain $90,000 after all realtor fees and settlement charges are paid, why would I sell it for less if I don't have a realtor, if I know someone will still pay $100,000 realtor or not?"
sanantonio,3d9ehh,beer_goblin,3,Wed Jul 15 01:34:08 2015 UTC,"Because you can tell them you're going independently, so they don't need to cut in the realtor. Yes, that's bargaining, but it's technically feasible."

It's ~2000 sq ft, 4/3/1 on a big corner lot and I rent it out for $1050, which is competitive with similar houses in the area.  Saying that rent is too high is just silly. The rent is as high as it is because there are people willing and able to pay it. Why wouldn't landlords raise the rent to what the market will bear? If they don't they're just subsidizing somebody else's housing costs."

Slab Cinema covers most of them.  • The Santikos Bijou at Crossroads Mall runs a free movie series -7pm every Thursday. The movie changes weekly.   • Most of the museums in town have a free evening or free day, some weekly, some monthly. At the McNay's Second Thursday, they usually have free beer and cider.  • The Pearl Brewery periodically does free concerts, sometimes outdoors at their river amphitheater, sometimes in the Pearl Stables. Get on their mailing list. They have a farmers' market every Sat and Sunday AM - good people watching.  • San Antonio has a Greenway Trail System that nearly circles the city - they add more miles every year. Best seen by bike.  • The Riverwalk may be familiar to you as the touristy downtown restaurant row. I enjoy walking it, though.  • Beyond the downtown section, the riverwalk has been expanded in recent years, with several miles to the north (the Museum Reach - runs from downtown to the Pearl and includes a lock and dam for the river taxis, to compensate for the elevation change) and 8 miles south (the Mission reach). The Mission stretch is best by bike. You can also rent kayaks and stand-up paddle boards.  The Museum section is an urban linear park, with no businesses at street level. Lot of public art. The Mission stretch is more natural. Along the Mission reach is a string of historic missions. They are a National Park, recently named a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and admission is free.  • Mentioned elsewhere, but First Friday is fun. Ostensibly an art walk, and there are gallery openings, but more than anything, it's a big street fair. Runs on S. Alamo between Probandt and Cesar Chavez."

Tell the host that you are going up to Bar 601 for happy hour and you will get a free ride up to the restaurant (you get a free ride as long as you plan on going to the restaurant for any reason). The drinks normally cost $8-$10 but from what I remember that is about what you would pay at the Iron Cactus without the view. If you make it for happy hour it is very affordable.

sanantonio,3d4qj8,zxwut,6,Tue Jul 14 00:32:38 2015 UTC,"The problem is that idiots like you believe that by simply existing and living our lives we're shoving something in your face. I could give a shit about a gay wedding expo, honestly, but do you have any idea how many goddamn straight weddings I had ""shoved in my face"" in the 42 years of my life when it was illegal for me to have one? I can't even count that high. If you don't like it, ignore it and go back to whatever the hell it is you were doing. You'll find your life proceeding along the same as ever."

sanantonio,3d6m9o,ebackhus,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:35:36 2015 UTC,The issue with the m8 when it comes to repairing the charge port is that they made 2 different versions of the M8. One version has a few extra gold contacts and an antenna connection. And the other doesn't. Most stores in San Antonio will not have the part in stock . And will always have to be specifically ordered for your phone after its been opened to see what version you will need.   Source: I manage a cellphone repair store.

sanantonio,3d4vwp,ebackhus,4,Mon Jul 13 17:55:13 2015 UTC,"Second for Florio's Pizza. Been going there for 20+ years. Always great.  The Longhorn Burgers on Blanco at 1604 has an Angus burger that's pretty solid. The one out by the Dominion just isn't quiet as good if you ask me. Sam's Burgers downtown is pretty solid, and Luther's used to be great but my last two experiences were mediocre at best. But it's worth a shot... You get to see some very alternative lifestyles!  Try out Golden Wok over by the Medical Center for Chinese. Also an old favorite of ours, but I am really not a fan of Chinese food. Used to go to Pearl Inn, but haven't been back in a long time.  El Bucannero is a mixed bag for me (someone else mentioned it). Tacos N Salsa on 1604 close to the Rim is really great. Tiago's is a chain, I think, but it's pretty solid.  But, like you, I'm not that familiar with downtown. Most of these are sorta North San Antonio area, but lots are worth the drive!"
sanantonio,3d4vwp,suprlonghorn,2,Mon Jul 13 18:00:17 2015 UTC,I liked http://www.saporespizza.com/ it was pretty good.  And for Chinese i recommend Golden Wok
sanantonio,3d4vwp,daisyifudo,2,Mon Jul 13 16:36:11 2015 UTC,"I had a pretty tasty Philly Cheese at the Drafthouse (local dine-in theater). For Chinese I prefer Ding How above all other for service, taste and atmosphere. Golden Wok is acceptable in a pinch. I'm not exactly picky with pizzas but there's a place called ""By the Slice"" near 90/Military that's pretty good. For burgers I'm a fan of Sam's Burger Joint. Being married to a former employee yields perks like perfectly cooked patties and extra condiments/veggies."
sanantonio,3d4vwp,sailirish7,2,Tue Jul 14 00:40:16 2015 UTC,"If you're downtown, be sure to check out Guillermo's for pizza. If you want a tasty burger, be sure to check out La Tuna."

There are also a lack of good grinders. VA had a chain called Zero's that was awesome, the closest you will come to is Zito's Deli, get a halfa serious.    Pizza - Florio's is cheap and good, and so is Ray's.    Burgers - San Antonio Burger Company and Longhorn Cafe. You can go to Chris Madrid's, it's an SA mainstay, but greasy as hell.    Chinese - Phoenix Cafe is great, you kind of have to try all kinds places. People like different places.      Mexican - Go eat at El Bucannero. get seafood, not Tex-Mex. you can pretty much walk into any Tex-Mex place and they're all the same. If you really want good Tex-Mex go to El Chaparral in Helotes    i don't know too many places downtown - Shilo's Delicatessen is good. There are great restaraunts in Southtown too."

Phoenix Cafe on west, Golden Wok on Wurzbach, and Kim Wa  on Bandera. Kung Fu noodles on Bandera is small with a short menu, but I love their lamb soup and beef dumplings. It's family run by first generation immigrants and they make their own noodles. Nama  Ramen on Babcock is fairly new but they have some delicious Japanese ramen. The pork is my favorite."

The owner is always there at the front and treats everyone like family. I went there the day I moved away and she cried and sent a ramen to go with me. Nicest lady ever, her name is Kacey."

If you are going to be on the NW Side - there is Northwest Vista, on the NE Side, there is Northeast Lake... the Alamo College system allows you to take courses on line too.  Then all credits are transferable to most State based universities like UTSA.  If you are doing a private college - like University of the Incarnate Word - check with them on the requirements for transferring of credits from community colleges too - so that way you take the classes you know will transfer.   Good Luck."

I just turned 20 and maybe im just a square but during the school year, the cops are always out here on the weekends, theres trash left all over the complex, parking sucks and at Avalon, there has been a string of smash and grabs throughout the year. so it isnt worth it to me to be 5 mins walking distance from the main campus."

Then Steve Martin left and focus shifts to Martin Short being accompanied by Jimmy Kimmel's pianist for 15 min on the left side of the stage. He talked about his father and and then gave a song and dance. In the end he strips down to a body suit with nipples and a penis drawn on and as he leaves the stage he says ""Top that, Mother F*cker!""  Then Steve Martin comes back with his Steep Canyon Rangers, they play 4-5 songs. Steve Martin is really good banjo player, we saw him in concert last time he was in town where he played a made jokes for two hours.  Small intermission type thing where they show a Steve Martin performance from the Johnny Carson show.  Steve Martin and Martin Shirt come back out and Steve Martin says the show is at its midpoint but he doesn't feel like they've done enough. Then he says David Letterman is here and welcomes him on stage. At this point it's dead silent as the entire room is holding their breath waiting to for him. Then, just past that moment when you decide Steve Martin is playing an odd joke out comes David Letterman sporting a sick grey/silver beard. Everyone is stunned by two things someone just walked out and then HOLY SHIT THAT REALLY IS DAVID LETTERMAN WITH A BEARD!!!!!  They pull out a ""wedding reception rental"" chair and David Letterman shares some of his stories with Steve and Martin on each side. Maybe 40 minutes ?

sanantonio,3cwq7v,Grave_Girl,3,Sat Jul 11 14:17:46 2015 UTC,"I am not fond of it.  There seems to be a plan to get rid of all the buildings across Alamo Plaza (which, by now, have historical value of their own) and ""rebuild"" the area to something closer to what was there at the time of the Battle of the Alamo.  Which has no chance in hell of looking right.  We don't need a movie set; people can go to Brackettville if that's what they want.  Wanting ""an experience"" is idiotic and frankly ahistorical.  The Alamo is the center of the city and the heart of the city and right now is still an important part of things; closing it off somewhat would seriously disrupt that.  There have been some changes already, and they're honestly unpleasant.  Once upon a time you could walk up to the doors of the Alamo and go in.  Now you have to line up and wait a ridiculous amount of time to even get inside.  And this whole time, you're standing there looking at plants and other tourists.  I've seen so many people get fed up and leave.  When you finally get to the front, you have to tell them how many are in your party (which isn't a burden, just irritating), and they want you to pose for a fucking souvenir photo.  I may be a bit unusual for a local, but I used to go to the Alamo a fair amount (my mother used to work on Houston street when I was a kid), and now I avoid it because it's too much of a pain in the ass to see."

As for the line itself, that I can get if you've got massive amounts of people visiting and wanting to get it. Thin it out some inside, do crowd control some. I'm fine with that."
sanantonio,3cwq7v,xixoxixa,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:04:35 2015 UTC,"Except they don't - the whole purpose of that fucking line is to make people go through the photo spot.  If you don't want the photo, you shouldn't have to stand in line."
sanantonio,3cwq7v,Rowdy10,3,Sat Jul 11 23:41:27 2015 UTC,"You just contradicted yourself a bit. You're unhappy with the DRT losing control, but you are completely unsatisfied with the current experience."
sanantonio,3cwq7v,xixoxixa,2,Sun Jul 12 05:08:52 2015 UTC,"No shit.  We took family to the Alamo and were pissed to learn that now it's super tourist-trap like.  No, I don't want to pay for the audio tour.  No, I'm not standing for your stupid picture that only shows some wall and could have been taken anywhere.  We waited in line, and then walked right past the photographer."

sanantonio,3cwq7v,nschirmer,5,Sat Jul 11 17:38:04 2015 UTC,"I went 2 years ago, 3 years ago, and 4 years ago... each time, when I went, there was a line. It probably just depends on the time of day you go, because obviously if there's a lot of people (tourists) there at the moment, they can't just let you ALL in at once, so they queue you up."
sanantonio,3cwq7v,Grave_Girl,2,Sat Jul 11 18:10:25 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure, actually.  Sometime around the first of the year, I guess.  We went after the rodeo parade downtown and that was the first time I personally experienced it.  I was kind of hoping it was just for high traffic or weekends, but no.  We were there again in March, mid-morning, with out of towners, and it was the same, and I sat on a bench and watched people go through it again in April.  You can still walk onto the grounds no problem, but for the Alamo itself, you've gotta line up."
sanantonio,3cwq7v,Bluegi,2,Sat Jul 11 17:44:02 2015 UTC,I've been a couple times this year and never seen the line be more than a minute.  My take is on the photo and asking for number is to space out the entry of people into the building by a couple of seconds.
sanantonio,3cwq7v,skintigh,0,Sat Jul 11 20:20:52 2015 UTC,"As I recall, they were using tax payer funds to pay for Tea Party events, and allowed the roof of the Alamo to leak so long it damaged exhibits.  Edit: it's been years since I've been there, but their posters about how the first white settlers had to ""defend their land from Indians"" and the omission of slavery as subject of the war were highly questionable."

I'd love to bring you in so you can document our culture but the problem is the last guy I allowed in, who I befriended and who also ended up marrying my sister, turned out to be an under cover cop.  Anyway, we all found out that family overcomes all differences and he ended up leading a rag-tag group to break me out of jail, while I was being transferred.  Then he (my bro in law) ended up trowing himself on the sword for me and got pinched.  Well, I couldn't let that stand so me and the same rag-tag crew busted him out as well.  Then, after all that settled down, we all ended up traveling across the world having adventures all while being pursued by The Rock himself, which is a funny story because he and I ended up having a fist fight in the cargo bay of a Russian cargo plane, which ended up crashing shortly after.  Anyway man, like I said, I'd love to help but things are kinda crazy for me at the moment.  Good luck though!  -Dom"

sanantonio,3cyy7o,nschirmer,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:08:45 2015 UTC,"I lived there in the Brady Tower (owned by Majestic group, connects the Majestic and Empire theaters) 2013-2015, just moved out a few months ago.  I was on the 7th floor and honestly didn't have many complaints.  I overlooked Houston St which was great since the South view basically just overlooks some industrial roofs (although looking south you do get to see the Tower).  My unit was a 2/2, 1000sqft and I paid about $1400.  Water was included and electric was less than $100.  Wood floors and granite with large closets, kitchen wasn't the best though. Management fined us for my roommate sneaking his parent's puppy in for the night but they're generally fair and fix problems promptly. Neighbors were cool, nobody was loud but it's definitely an older crowd.  Mostly retired folks in the Majestic tower, more young professionals in the Brady but overall older people in general.  I would absolutely live there again, my only real complaints is they don't make it easy to have friends over.  Parking is hard to come by unless your friends want to pay $10 to park in the garage (which fills up ALL the time because of the shows), or they have to walk blocks from the free parking areas.  You also have to go down and bring them up once they get there so small get togethers were a pain having to run down to let each person in when they arrived.  All that being said, you are right in the middle of the action downtown, tourists everywhere, great restaurants, pub run goes by right outside, people in tuxes going to the shows, Ferraris and Bentleys sitting in valet for the restaurants nearby (had to plug my old carspotting account from back then!)...

The road will then be torn up again to fix the fuck up... like Zarzamora.  By the time they finish the resurfacing on the areas first constructed they will then need to go resurface the ares they later constructed as by this time it's due for it.  A water main will be ruptured and the road will have to be broken up in various parts to fix this... re-construction will take about 6-8 months  Expect the road to be finished between 8 and 10 years.... like... wait.

sanantonio,3csqbu,Enzotheguardian,4,Fri Jul 10 16:31:47 2015 UTC,Yeah he did. And there are documents showing he did. He actually tried to discourage ALL fire union members from disclosing who was on their healthcare plans.   Provide evidence for the Sculley claim.
sanantonio,3csqbu,TXSA,-2,Fri Jul 10 16:44:36 2015 UTC,Here is his rebuttal. I was not saying sculley was committing insurance fraud just saying she is shady. Ill try and find some unbiased links.
sanantonio,3csqbu,Enzotheguardian,6,Fri Jul 10 17:03:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah that is what is called an ""Op-Ed""   If you notice, it was written by Steele himself, so it lacks credibility.   Op-Eds are not subject to the kind of fact checking that columns are, and I would expect a strong denial from someone who is accused of fraud.   Also, Sculley has this city rated AAA for their credit, the highest ranking we can receive, and the only large metro to have such a rating IN THE WHOLE COUNTRY. People say she is shady because she makes a boatload of money. I say it is well deserved. Having worked personally with her, I can assure you, she is far from shady."

sanantonio,3cr3qq,Beautiful_Smile,3,Fri Jul 10 04:40:55 2015 UTC,We also went out to Friedrich wilderness and it was a little elevated and hilly but not much. I'm from Hawaii and am use to hiking to the top of a mountain so these trails are really different than what I'm use to.

sanantonio,3cr3qq,riadfodig,2,Sat Jul 11 01:17:11 2015 UTC,"Go back to Government Canyon. Go to the back country. There's a few overlooks you definitely missed.   Take Joe Johnston Route north from the back country trailhead. Turn right onto recharge trail, then turn left onto Bluff Spurs. Turn left again onto South Bluff Spur. Follow the trail about half a mile until it dead ends at a beautiful view. If there are a few clouds in the sky, the sunset is awesome from this point. Similar start as above, but instead keep on going on recharge trail until it turns into the Far Reaches trail. This trail has several overlooks, but getting to them may not be quite as exciting. Lastly, the Canyon Overlook. Take Joe Johnston Route north, then turn left onto Caroline's Loop, followed very quickly by a right onto Overlook Trail. This will lead you to the top of the cliff where the dinosaur tracks are (which were under water as of Monday).    Be sure to take a look at the map to plan your trip based on the distances you expect to go. Government Canyon is over 12,000 acres, with 40+ miles of trails, so surely some of those trails will impress you."
sanantonio,3cr3qq,cyvaquero,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:06:29 2015 UTC,I did run that first route you mentioned. Id like to find trails with more elevation; my go to spot in California had a little over 3000 feet in elevation although that was generally a 5 to 6 hour hike.  I do plan on going back because I missed the canyon overlook. Was in a rush to get back home because I hiked for four hours in tennis shoes (my boots got lost in the mail)

It is offensive to use the rebel battle flag as a symbol of a city or state but it is also offensive to pretend that Texas was never a slave state or that racism has played no role in our history for the past 150 years.

I went to court this morning & the city of San Antonio offered me a plea "" bargain"" -- plead guilty, be on probation, pay a fine & I had to promise never to commit ""the crime"" again. I said no thank you. NO THANK YOU Why would I plead guilty to a ""crime"" that doesn't exist, pay a fine to a city that is infringing on my constitutional rights( freedom of religion, speech & assembly) 14th amendment of due process, federal &states laws & a federal court order on the same issue litigated & won by street feeders in Dallas? thank you but no thank you & I would like to use that $ to keep feeding people in need-- homeless AND working poor. but equally important is how can I promise the court to stop feeding people I see ( and you all see) who are hungry? This isn't just my fight. it is OUR fight. thousands of San Antonians & all over this country stop & share food & buy food for our neighbors & members of our community in need who have fallen on hard times. THIS is a ""crime""? I don't think so & I'm not going to make a promise that I can't & won't keep.  SO NO THANK YOU city hall.  AND that's why I asked for a jury trial. if the people of San Antonio say I'm wrong, then I'll listen. But I'm not going to listen to City Hall-- Not to the mayor or city council when they r way off base.  This ordinance is illegal & it impacts EVERY Good Samaritan in this city & there r many!! MANY.  I deliver food that comes straight out of a commercial kitchen just like dominoes pizza, Jimmy johns, caterers across SAT & every restaurant delivery biz in this city. There is NO LAW in this city that prohibits this kind of food delivery. BC if that was true then every restaurant that delivers food needs to also get a ticket. We know what this is really about. SO I'm asking the city of SAT to use your resources ( our resources as $$ taxpayers) to fight crime. REAL crime. Helping our neighbor, our community is NOT a crime. good night & thanks. thank you to the people of San Antonio"". -- Joan"

sanantonio,3ci41l,TheGraham,7,Wed Jul 8 02:13:48 2015 UTC,"Just found out the news this afternoon. I'm kind of still in shock over it. I had heard his health with declining, but I didn't imagine it this quickly.  Hogwild and Jaime have been extremely good to me over my years of collecting vinyl here in San An. He always had his thumb on what bands were coming to town and how to promote them using the shop. I literally only saw the guy what seems like two weeks ago looking in perfect health. It's mind boggling to me that he's gone. I'll never forget the time he got the new World/Inferno record in the shop just after hearing me talk about it. Didn't have to ask or anything, I just showed up one day and it was there."

sanantonio,3ci41l,FrostMute,0,Wed Jul 8 02:14:41 2015 UTC,"Interestingly, it was not metal, but electronic music that this place introduced me to. They had a decent DnB/Jungle selection back in the 90's, and I remember scanning across all these cool looking album covers and names.  I ended up buying a Dillinja EP and a Dieselboy Mixtape, without ever hearing them, because I had heard a little of this music called DnB from a friend and the names and album covers looked COOL.  Still enthralled by that genre of music to this day.  Thanks Hogwild, and condolences."

sanantonio,3ckfvp,Drlawl,3,Wed Jul 8 18:37:32 2015 UTC,"I used to work there in college, if you go during the week and not on Friday/Saturday/Sunday it won't be so busy and you really won't need a flashpass, maybe the cheap one if it is slightly busy.  If you go during a holiday or a crowded time like a Saturday than the flashpass is worth it if you are willing to spend the money."

sanantonio,3cfwxi,iseeamansardroof,10,Wed Jul 8 02:54:28 2015 UTC,I always heard that Devil's Den by Ingram Park Mall was the meeting place of some San Antonio Occultists. We used to play paintball in the woods there and there were always a bunch of animal bones everywhere. We just assumed it was wild animals but then again you never know. Supposedly a few people went missing in those woods at night though.
sanantonio,3cfwxi,gabe0654,10,Wed Jul 8 03:56:38 2015 UTC,"Two kids I went to school with were murdered in Devil's Den...  It actually happened, its not a myth; either '96 or '97 if I am remembering right.  My scout troop participated in a clean up effort the city (I think it was the city) put on after the murder, in an attempt to make that area a little less shady.  When it happened, the rumors I remember all had to do with the killings being some kind of 'satanic' offering. The murder(ers) were supposedly 'satanist' or the like and the kids were killed in some, supposedly, ritualistic manner.   Gory side note:  I believe one of the victims had their skull smashed with a rock.  That's all I can remember."
sanantonio,3cfwxi,FrostMute,7,Tue Jul 7 17:53:30 2015 UTC,"Did some googling and found this synopsis in a doc about solved cold cases on the city's website PDF source.    Two Holmes students.

sanantonio,3cfwxi,gabe0654,2,Wed Jul 8 03:27:26 2015 UTC,Jordan Middle School / Holmes High School  I can't remember if it happened in 8th grade or freshman year... I think it happened as we were leaving Jordan to go to High School.
sanantonio,3cfwxi,FrostMute,2,Tue Jul 7 21:17:34 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I went to Jordan from 05 to 07. Never once heard anyone talk about kids murdered. Must of been covered up. This only adds to the story."

sanantonio,3cfwxi,FrostMute,2,Tue Jul 7 21:41:21 2015 UTC,"I was gonna say, I remember reading that a few years ago when I discovered the cold cases section.  That place was crazy active back around 2007, I'm talking hordes of people bringing ATVs and dirtbikes, people playing paint ball and and of course all the mudding and rock crawling.  Then they blocked it all off and eventually built that bridge, which was severely needed because of the flooding cutting off that vital route over the creek."

Growing up my little sister and I would get bored while my mom was teaching a class and we'd start exploring all the places we shouldn't. The kiln, the basements, wherever we could. A couple of times we almost got caught and the guy that almost caught us a couple times told some haunted tours thing that a couple of girls haunted the place. Maybe it really was some ghosts and I'm just being arrogant but he started telling those tales a couple years after we knocked that off."
sanantonio,3cihni,drunktraveler,3,Wed Jul 8 04:13:58 2015 UTC,I have had a 1 and 1 account for about a decade.  It costs about 8 bucks a month.  The original plan included two domains with email and web hosting for each domain.  Now the plan is one domain but I am grandfathered for two.  I pay about 9 bucks a month.  I think it is kind of high.  I have heard horror stories about the company but I seem to be lucky.  It has been reliable but they are occasions the server times out.
sanantonio,3cihni,rr777,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:31:38 2015 UTC,I'll second this for sure.  I have used 1and1 for over 10 years and I think mine is like $6 a month for an upgraded plan with some other bells and whistles.  If you just want email and a simple website the basic plan is like $5 a month and they include a domain name with that.

sanantonio,3cihni,happyfeet19,3,Wed Jul 8 04:27:50 2015 UTC,"Rackspace is rarely the cheapest choice. Rackspace's claim to fame is ""fanatical customer support,"" and that comes at a premium price. If you want a service where you can pick up a phone and speak to someone based in the USA 24x7 about a problem with your hosting, they're a great choice. If you're knowledgeable enough to do some troubleshooting on your own, there are cheaper options."
sanantonio,3cihni,LessThanEnthused,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:29:11 2015 UTC,Agreed. If you are a small business without your own IT department (or even a IT person) Rackspace is a good option if you can afford it because they can answer all your technical questions and help you get everything setup to work the way you need it. The standard pop/imap mailboxes are just $2/month if you want to save money and don't need the functionality of Exchange. ;)
sanantonio,3cihni,LessThanEnthused,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:46:28 2015 UTC,Thank you both.  I didn't want to be a Rackspace homer because they are based here and I know several Rackers.

It is 0-2.   so he was likely selling   You've never sold or bought pot before, have you?  0-2 OZ is NOTHING and is the common amount bought for personal use. Dealers deal with POUNDS (if we are talking MexiSchwag).   Hopefully he doesn't get off light.   Hopefully we'll stop sending people to jail for victimless, bullshit 'crimes' at some point. That our society still thinks arresting people for marijuana is a GOOD thing is BAFFLING and just shows how backwards and antiquated we are.

I used to live in a midwestern city where the highest-paid city employees were union bus drivers. Their contract said they could get as much overtime as they wanted. Some of the most senior drivers were working 80-hour weeks to bring in over $200K a year - more than the city's mayor. Their incentive was that their retirement pension was based on their highest-income years, so they were feathering their nests by working insane hours."

Oh and don't tell me that people who work in offices don't have health consequences long after their job. It has been statistically proven time and again, humans aren't meant to be sitting for long periods of time. Long terms of sitting can lead to just as many health issues.  Ex is right. I've known many cops who milk the crap out of overtime pay for the pension. The states version of an unsustainable financial retirement system. ERST is already financially insolvent."

If you're too far from somewhere that the signal ""starts"", you may not get anywhere close to their advertised speeds.  As for TWC speeds. I recently got the new modem from them. If I'm plugged in directly to the modem, I can get up to 200 mb/s. If I use their modem on the 5 GHz band, I can get about 100-120 mb/s. If I use their modem at 2.4 GHz, I get around 60-70 mb/s.   The advertised speed for my plan is 200 mb/s. I do not experience any change in speed based on time of day. I opt to use the 2.4 GHz frequency because it is compatible with all of the devices in the house, which I can't say the same for the 5 GHz frequency.   Also, oddly enough, I've never heard of TWC speeds slowing depending on neighborhood usage. I have heard that about AT&T, though. My vote stays with TWC."
sanantonio,3cgq3e,riadfodig,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:41:31 2015 UTC,The speed is based on the total users bandwidth at any given time so it's possible some neighborhoods could be on overcrowded pipes.

If everyone around you is using the internet to an extreme degree, you will notice it, but it's honestly not likely in these areas.  AT&T on the other hand is not ""cable"" so it won't, but your distance from the node will affect it. Also, AT&T doesn't offer anything greater than 24Mbps (and only 18Mbps in most areas), so they'll always be slower for you compared to what you can get from TWC.  I've got the 300/20 package from TWC and have no complaints. If I don't always get the full 300, I certainly wouldn't notice it unless I'm trying to download something big as quickly as possible which is rare. I definitely get at least 200 most of the time."

Apparently, there's a lot of distaste for this person, and it seems to be caused by:   The whole subreddit land grab game. Whoever creates a subreddit first has complete control over it. A lot of the best subreddits for certain subjects have bizarre names simply because the owners of the good names grabbed the 'expected' name and did nothing good with it, or actively did something malicious (see below). Reddit doesn't really have a solution for this. This mod has figured out a trick to get other users shadowbanned, and makes use of their large network of subreddits to achieve it. If this mod has a disagreement with you, and finds out you have any alt, they are able to ban it from all 80 subreddits. Not a problem in itself, but if you contribute to one of the subreddits incidentally on your main, reddit thinks you're trying to get around a subreddit ban and shadowbans you completely."

sanantonio,3cdvd5,SanAntonioDrama,-8,Wed Jul 8 15:03:15 2015 UTC,"Just to be clear, there's no trick to it. Both glasnostic and Vee_Vee had their main accounts banned from /r/SanAntonioFood and /r/SanAntonioDrama, respectively, for intentionally being abusive in those subs and for harassing mods. They were aware of their bans and responded to the ban messages. glasnostic was given an appeal but instead used it to promise he would get me shadowbanned. They then created alts such as stabcangofuckhimself, stabantoniosucksdicks, and SanAntonioDrama to continue being abusive.    If you are abusive to a mod in their own subreddit you will probably get banned from that sub. And if you create alts to evade that subreddit ban then you will be shadowbanned. Apologizing for it, or claiming you didn't know you couldn't use an alt, will sometimes get the shadowban reversed, but that's not guaranteed. They knew what they were doing and that it was against Reddit's rules."

sanantonio,3cdvd5,amperages,7,Thu Jul 9 15:54:10 2015 UTC,My question is why no one is asking you to stop creating drama. All you have to do is shut the fuck up. The same advice you keep giving everyone else. I would recommend you simply stop talking.

It includes architectural and archaeological structures, farmlands, residencies, churches and granaries, as well as water distribution systems. The complexes were built by Franciscan missionaries in the 18th century and illustrate the Spanish Crown’s efforts to colonize, evangelize and defend the northern frontier of New Spain. The San Antonio Missions are also an example of the interweaving of Spanish and Coahuiltecan cultures, illustrated by a variety of features, including the decorative elements of churches, which combine Catholic symbols with indigenous designs inspired by nature."

The World Heritage Site list is one such list.  San Antonio will now be hyped in books and publicity about the WHS's.  It will give some visitors a reason to come to Texas.  In my experience as a host of international visitors,  Europeans who come to the USA usually visit NYC, San Francisco, LA and maybe Las Vegas.   They might drive through Texas without stopping.  We are hoping this will put us on more itineraries.   Once they see the missions and the Alamo of course they will want to get drunk on the Riverwalk, I mean see the beautiful Riverwalk and spend lots of money."

You might have a hard time getting customer service jobs speaking directly with customers due to your impairment unfortunately.

sanantonio,3bveiw,dubate,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:43:10 2015 UTC,Isn't that already a wireless modem? Are you having connection issues with it? How many people/devices do you expect to be connected at once (don't forget to count cell phones).
sanantonio,3bveiw,dubate,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:40:49 2015 UTC,I'm maxing out at 100 mbs down via wireless and 117 mbs hardwired.  Typically there's 5-8 devices connected at all times.

sanantonio,3bveiw,ebackhus,0,Sat Jul 4 01:57:26 2015 UTC,"We stream just about everything via either the smart tv or apple tv. Our computers/devices OS consist of MAC and Windows.    Please tell me you are not using streaming services wirelessley......  In any case, D-link and Linksys routers are pretty solid. Depending on your level of expertise, you might want to consider getting a ""configurable"" router.  Don't ever trust anything from Netgear, or any weird sounding third-party routers as they have high failure rates and poor construction and can be tempermental."
sanantonio,3bveiw,nothinfollowsme,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:06:19 2015 UTC,Please tell me you are not using streaming services wirelessley......   Why not? My Roku boxes are all connected via wireless and do fine. My PS3 and Xbox are also wireless and stream without a hitch. The craziest part is that my router isn't much to write home about and handles our streaming without any qualms.
sanantonio,3bveiw,ebackhus,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:38:35 2015 UTC,"Why not? My Roku boxes are all connected via wireless and do fine. My PS3 and Xbox are also wireless and stream without a hitch. The craziest part is that my router isn't much to write home about and handles our streaming without any qualms.   That's all well and good, but you are missing out on a decent percentage of your bandwidth as connecting wirelessly can reduce it depending on the router. Not counting how many other devices are streaming, downloading, torrenting, or whatever else that is bandwidth intensive.  Then again, I don't know what your DS/US speeds are so it's speculative on my side.  As a rule of thumb, I generally have everything that can be hard-wired to the modem/router plugged in to maximize the benefits."
sanantonio,3bveiw,nothinfollowsme,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:48:55 2015 UTC,200/20 is what we have. Typically I prefer wired (all my computers are wired) but in an apartment it's more practical to go with wifi when you can run Cat5e in the walls.
sanantonio,3bveiw,ebackhus,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:29:50 2015 UTC,"Ok, you should be fine then. With wireless you should be ok so long as no other wireless routers are operating on the same signal channel as yours."

Park as close as you can on either the side streets or the residential streets.  You don't have to spend all day if you don't want to.  We usually walk down there and arrive with 10 or 20 minutes to spare.

By comparison, approximately 30% of those 1.8 million people are Roman Catholics.  Hell, Mormons (1.48%) are more numerous than Hagee's flock.  He's certainly known as a weirdo, and his ramblings make great ""Y'all won't believe the stupidity coming out of San Antonio this week"" stories.

It attracts 100,000 which is a lot but the whole park is like a single amphitheater when it comes to fireworks.  Imagine a theater that is over 1000 yards long.  It could hold a lot more people.  Parking is easier than you might think.  Drive down Vollum or San Antonio to get as close as you can to the park.  It is safe to leave your car there.  You can park on those side streets or on the residential streets.  Because that whole area is on a grid the people spread out pretty fast.  You can make your way to the east to Fredericksburg or Zarzamora and get out of there.  The neighborhood to the north of the lake is definitely safer than the one to the south and it has easier access to large roads to leave.  You can arrive just before the show starts and there will be plenty of room to stand or spread a blanket on the baseball, or undeveloped soccer field.

sanantonio,3bodxb,nemesis1211,2,Tue Jun 30 21:22:02 2015 UTC,"The late night buses start with ""2"" in the route number. This is because they typically combine two routes into one loop - ie: route 209 goes north as route 9 then comes south as route 10.

I called to cancel because I really wanted to and the rep kept asking if I wanted a new plan. I kept telling her no, I rather cancel because my initial rep said pay as you go and this wasn't a promotion. I was lied to.   She then offered to lower my bill from the new rate and upgrade my internet for free.   I reluctantly agreed and was transferred to a customer retention department.

sanantonio,3bnh8c,Ratmax00,2,Fri Jul 3 17:26:58 2015 UTC,"I think TWC uses your home address so it's under one account no parter/SO signup allowed.   However, it does depend on how tied you are to TWC. Whenever the introductory bill goes up I always have a better offer in hand (Uverse, Dish) and call TWC up to cancel my service. My reason is always well Uverse/Dish is offering this if I switch to them. I usually get through the initial stages and then someone jumps on the line who ""is able"" to match the new promo. Quick way to save a disconnect-reconnect and you save a few bucks in the process. If things do go south and they don't want your business just switch to the better offer anyway."

sanantonio,3bnh8c,Ratmax00,2,Tue Jun 30 18:05:14 2015 UTC,I do this every year with u-verse. Ask for retention and see what they will do for you. Don't even need a matching offer unless it's better than their promotions. If they won't give you anything better or match the promotion then just go ahead and cancel. I've never had an issue with AT&T giving me the promotional rate with a new one year contract.

Call Time Warner customer support and when the automated voice asks why you're calling say ""Cancel Service"". You'll get routed to a retention department and when they ask why you're canceling, tell them that you need to start lowering a lot of your living expenses and that you're switching to Earthlink because they're cheaper. They'll probably throw the speed differences at you but just tell them that 20mbs is more than fast enough for what you do, especially at the price. This year they  bumped up the modem rental charge to $8/Mo so I bought my own modem to save more. I did all of that several months ago after my initial promotional pricing expired and I'm now getting the 100 Mbs  Extreme package for about $40/Mo after taxes. Hopefully, they won't call your bluff and will throw a deal of some sort at you. Good luck!"

I think part of the issue is you are looking for a place to rent during PCS season, when a ton of military families are moving into the area.  I know a family that is having to stay in a hotel until September when the house they are going to rent is available.  We bought our house back in December and we still have people showing up asking if it's still for sale  I think the other issue is that $1400 is really low for the type of house you want in the area you want it in just in general but again especially for this  time of year.  I hope you can find a place but if not maybe try again in September/October?"
sanantonio,3bn7pc,MrTX,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:51:05 2015 UTC,"Your point about PCS makes so much sense! We were wondering why all of the places that were available a few months ago had disappeared. $1400 doesn't include utilities, although that would be nice and we're willing to go higher if it means utilities are included.   We've found plenty of houses that meet what we're looking for in our price range and general preferred areas, but none of the realtors/landlords are open to our roommate and income situation."

sanantonio,3bkksk,pkakira88,2,Tue Jun 30 00:37:47 2015 UTC,"Awesome place, they've got BBQ pork and crispy pork belly in the back.  Be sure to visit on Thursday evening, when the Chinese sponge (swiss roll) cakes are delivered.  It's always gone by Friday."
sanantonio,3bkksk,vorpalpillow,3,Tue Jun 30 05:08:33 2015 UTC,"Om nom nom. Crispy pork belly is the bomb. I go here anyway if I need anything out of the norm (otherwise, I go to the little Japanese market next to Nikki's on Hildebrand). But the pork puts it over the top.  Edit to add I had a puro San Antonio moment there last week - Japanese customer and Chinese guy behind the counter having a long detailed conversation in Spanish. The Japanese lady was fluent; the Chinese guy was competent. It was kind of cool."
sanantonio,3bkksk,fiddlechick,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:51:41 2015 UTC,Came here to say Tim's Oriental Market. My mom's from Shanghai and that's the only asian market she really goes to.
sanantonio,3bkksk,MasonIsACat,6,Tue Jun 30 03:38:30 2015 UTC,"There are two on the NE side worth checking. On Rittiman, there's the Korean mart which has a wide array of tools, utensils, and cookware on top of a modest selection of foods. Up off Walzem between Ray Bon and Midcrown, there's a Vietnamese market which has a wider selection of foods, a butchery, a seafood section, a produce department, and an entire aisle devoted just to various ramen/udon/noodle incarnations. Off Rittiman and Austin Highway, there are also several restaurants ranging from Korean barbecue to Thai cuisine if you don't feel like cooking."
sanantonio,3bkksk,Vaidurya,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:04:26 2015 UTC,"These are new to me - do you happen to know the names?  Edit: I let my fingers do the walking. Is this the Korean Mart on Rittiman? Seoul Oriental Food Market & Cafe   And Vietnamese Market  Thanks for these. Interested in the butcher section of the Vietnamese market. I make pho, and it's hard to find the thin beef. I usually buy the extra thin milanesa at HEB, but that's really too thick."
sanantonio,3bkksk,fiddlechick,2,Tue Jun 30 14:55:40 2015 UTC,Hard to find the thin beef? I've got some tools I could sell you to help you out with that (they are called knives) :P
sanantonio,3bkksk,Brainspackle,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:14:33 2015 UTC,"My knife skills are lacking. And lazy. :)   That said - can you get it as thin as you could with a meat slicer using a knife? Like deli meat thin? I know the semi-frozen meat trick, but assumed I wouldn't be able to get it that thin. I do have a madolin slicer - maybe that would work."
sanantonio,3bkksk,fiddlechick,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:30:03 2015 UTC,"I bet they'll have just what you need. On the other hand, if you'd like a cheater, you can request ""XLT"" brisket from Bill Miller's. They use a deli slicer to slice some lean brisket extra thin, and it usually ends up thinner than a 1 at HEB. I look forward to seeing all y'all in my neck of the woods, and you got both of the shops right.  ETA: there's a nice Pho noodle restaurant off Bitters near 281. 300 Bitters is the address, and it's named Pho Cong."
sanantonio,3bkksk,Vaidurya,2,Tue Jun 30 16:38:16 2015 UTC,"Good idea, but I'm looking for raw meat, preferably sirloin."
sanantonio,3bkksk,fiddlechick,6,Tue Jun 30 19:59:14 2015 UTC,I frequent Hung Phong between Eisenhauer and Rittiman. They have lots of stuff and the prices are pretty good.
sanantonio,3bkksk,bossashell,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:33:08 2015 UTC,Also important to note that the market day for Hung Phong is Thursday. This is when they get all their fresh produce in. By far the best day to go if you want something that isn't in a can. Same thing goes for Vietnam Market on Walzem. Their market day is Thursday as well. By Friday it is slim pickings. Very heavy turn out of local asians on those days.
sanantonio,3bkksk,root_console,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:06:25 2015 UTC,Hung Phong has a market now?! This has been my favorite Pho location for 12+ years. Haven't been in a long time as it's quite a drive from where I live...
sanantonio,3bkksk,aegault,5,Wed Jul 1 20:25:09 2015 UTC,Tim's Oriental on Bandera has a large market. I don't think they have pho though.

sanantonio,3bkksk,violinplayer,3,Tue Jun 30 13:17:44 2015 UTC,There's one next to Niki's Tokyo Inn on Hildebrand east of Blanco.
sanantonio,3bkksk,megazomb87,3,Tue Jun 30 17:08:55 2015 UTC,"There's also Minnano, Japanese market on Callaghan.  That one is the best lit, and cleanest.  It also has more souvenirs and cultural items.  If you know exactly what you want, and shop frequently, the other Japanese grocery (on Hildebrand) Niki's will sometimes make special orders for you.  We did this with flavored Calpico drink.  I think Niki's restocks inventory on Fridays, and that's the best time to go.  Niki's and Minnano have the most helpful staffs, followed by the korean groceries.  At the Korean groceries, there's usually more of a language barrier with older staff, but those places are still very welcoming.  In San Antonio,  you kind of have to figure out which grocery is going to suit your needs, especially if you're looking for something very specific, or slightly pricey, like Yuzu juice.   Also, check expiration dates, if that's something that bothers you. Good luck!  Here's a breakdown:  Size/selection: The Korean mart at 1027 Rittiman Rd seems to be the biggest. It has an area to eat in, and occasionally you can get fresh made Taiyaki (I think on Friday's.)   Veggies: Both Korean Markets on Rittiman have ok vegetable aisles, and I think in-house Kimchi.  Sake: In terms of Sake, Central Market has the best selection, but you'll pay through the nose.  Twin liquors  on 281 seems to have a decent sake selection, and sometimes Shochu. Tim's has a small sake selection, as does the Korean mart at (6210 Fairdale Dr) and Niki's.  Pork Belly: is cheap at the Vietnamese grocery on Walzem. That's also the most rundown looking grocery of the bunch. They also carry big, whole Durian, pretty decent premade steamed buns, and several varieties of fish sauce. I like going here the least, except to get those items.  Least helpful staff at this location. You're on your own. My wife is Vietnamese-American, and we only go for those specific items when we run out."

I also go to Chockdee's in Universal City, which is Filipino and has a restaurant that makes GREAT Filipino food and Sari Sari Market by Park North. Sari Sari has a little market, but it's not as big as the other I mentioned, but it has a Filipino restaurant attached that's pretty good."
sanantonio,3bkksk,gwink3,2,Tue Jun 30 02:17:09 2015 UTC,"Reading all the comments almost all the Asian food marts are covered. There is also ali babas,  it's more of am eastern/middle eastern mart.

Lots of good kimchi, but haven't found any place that does packaged bulgogi like H Mart does. There's tons of pho places all over the city, it's probably just under Thai as far as number of establishments go."
sanantonio,3bkksk,SallyTwoToes,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:32:58 2015 UTC,"I have different favorite ones for my various needs.   My favorite for Japanese things is Minano at Fredericksburg and Callaghan. Vietnamese, I go to a Vietnamese grocery store on Walzem (heading east from i-35). It's t right next to a giant dollar store. My favorite thing there is that they sell whole duck for only about $15 and will occasionally have fresh jackfruit. There's also a really nice grocery store that has some central Asian elements If you head east on wurzbock from I-10. Really big store, hard to miss.  And while not Asian, there is this really neat international food store at Callaghan and Blanco (it's just a little bit birth of the 410 loop) that's run by this Nigerian guy that's really nice. Has a lot of petty cool items that you would only find in Africa.   I've been to a few other Asian food stores I town, but the ones I listed are the ones that I like because they tend to be clean, not smell too horrible, and they price their stuff well. I still haven't found a super great place for Korean things, but if anyone knows of one, I'll head out to it and give my review."
sanantonio,3bkksk,fiddlechick,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:54:57 2015 UTC,I sometimes find myself at minano because it was a favorite of my asian mom.  it sure is a long way from where I live.  Last week I needed more rice.  Heb rice is all long grain and I am dedicated to nishiki rice.  I found it cheaper and closer at Chock-Dee in Universal City.

We Came As Romans is an awesome band, and with new material, it's no wonder they closed.  Citizen first two albums are amazing but I'm wishy washy on their transition sound.  Matchbook Romance came back after a long hiatus.  So its was a really nice line up.  What time they play always varies because some can be tired from the night before or just wanna beat the heat.    And while you might not recognize bands, its always nice to give new ones a shot.  This Wild Life: I can't say more about that band.

My suggestion would be to make it more difficult to jump the railing without making any noise or simply hopping over like it's nothing.  I think maybe some light shelves made top heavy with reasonably sized flower pots placed along the railing or a bbq pit you stash on your balcony if you have one (remember to chain that down, too). Grow cactus in flower pots for added deterrents.  If you've done all this already and they take your coolers again then my only other suggestion would be to buy a loud monkey and tie him to your wrist but have on your balcony."

It's absolutely awful.
sanantonio,3bfaca,ResoundingGolfClap,6,Sun Jun 28 20:04:46 2015 UTC,"You know, it's one thing to be a spineless prick and steal someone's bbq pit or whatever, but it takes a lower level type of asshole to steal someone's pet.   I remember during undergrad I went to my one of my first college parties as a freshman.  It was in one of those neighborhoods on babcock between dzv and hausman.    Host was cool, the people there were all pretty nice and it wasn't anything too crazy.  Good group.    Guy has the cutest boxer puppy just walking around that was getting some loving.  I mean, what an attention magnet. The entire party this dude would stop what he's doing to make sure his dog was ok, you could definitely tell he loved that pup.    Fastforward a few hours and some shady group of guys walk into the party.  A few minutes the host notices them, asks them to leave, they get in his face about it and start threatening him for telling them to take off.  Eventually, after an exchanging of words, the group leaves.    Mood starts to lighten up, and the host goes to look for his dog.  Lo and behold, the puppy is missing.  At some point when the leader of the douches was getting in the face of the owner of the home and telling him he was going to kill him, one of the other idiots stole the puppy.     It's been about 7-8 years ago since that happened and I still remember the atmosphere the second the guy figured it out after tearing his house apart.   He was a mix of extremely pissed off to crying his eyes out because his dog just got stolen.   I don't even think he knew who those guys were.   Sickens me to this day.    Recently had my car broken into here at my complex in the medical area too, being robbed is definitely one of the worst feelings ever.  Truly is."

During the peak of his popularity he played for the rival Lakers who we all know and hate. It is rumored that he held a special party for his fans here in San Antonio in the early 2000's but he did not show up because the attendance was low.
sanantonio,3ba6mf,darkjedisa,3,Sat Jun 27 17:43:38 2015 UTC,"Regarding Shaq I remember a couple of things. First off, when he went to LSU, the LSU highlights came right after the Spurs highlights in the local sports channels. They chronicled almost everything he did over there.   There was a lot of love for Shaq...until he was drafted by the Magic.   In the first home game between the Spurs and Magic, Shaq father got in a fight because fans nearby where really talking shit about Shaq. Since then, Shaq pretty much stopped associating with San Antonio, until his retirement where he makes mention of it whenever the Spurs play on TNT. Because of this, I have doubt there was an event for Shaq here in town."

Standing 7 ft 1 in (2.16 m) tall  and weighing 325 pounds (147 kg), he was one of the heaviest players ever to play in the NBA. O'Neal played for six teams throughout his 19-year NBA career.  Following his career at Louisiana State University, O'Neal was drafted by the Orlando Magic with the first overall pick in the 1992 NBA draft. He quickly became one of the best centers in the league, winning Rookie of the Year in 1992–93 and later leading his team to the 1995 NBA Finals. After four years with the Magic, O'Neal signed as a free agent with the Los Angeles Lakers. They won three consecutive championships in 2000, 2001, and 2002. Amid tension between O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, O'Neal was traded to the Miami Heat in 2004, and his fourth NBA championship followed in 2006. Midway through the 2007–2008 season he was traded to the Phoenix Suns. After a season-and-a-half with the Suns, O'Neal was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers in the 2009–10 season.  O'Neal played for the Boston Celtics in the 2010–11 season before retiring.   O'Neal's individual accolades include the 1999–2000 MVP award, the 1992–93 NBA Rookie of the Year award, 15 All-Star game selections, three All-Star Game MVP awards, three Finals MVP awards, two scoring titles, 14 All-NBA team selections, and three NBA All-Defensive Team selections. He is one of only three players to win NBA MVP, All-Star game MVP and Finals MVP awards in the same year (2000); the other players are Willis Reed in 1970 and Michael Jordan in 1996 and 1998. He ranks 6th all-time in points scored, 5th in field goals, 13th in rebounds, and 7th in blocks. Largely due to his ability to dunk the basketball, O'Neal also ranks 3rd all-time in field goal percentage (58.2%).   In addition to his basketball career, O'Neal has released four rap albums, with his first, Shaq Diesel, going platinum. He has appeared in numerous films and has starred in his own reality shows, Shaq's Big Challenge and Shaq Vs..

An old roommate I had in undergrad (about 8 years ago) had a dad who was trying to expand over here got a visit from said liquor store chain ""representative"" at his new location.  He described them as two bigger biker looking men.  They walked in, told him he was in their (the stores) territory and threatened him and the clerk that they needed to head out or deal with the consequences.   No idea what happened with that since I transferred out of the dorms after the first semester and this had happened around November at the time.  That's the only account I've personally heard from someone I know, but I've come across stories of the guy and his goons being total assholes to smaller business owners by other people.   I don't know many people in the liquor business but I've always wanted to know to what extent it happens or how true it was.  The owner has a reputation for being a total asshole, though, so I wouldn't doubt them being untrue at the time."

Mostly to avoid idiots falling out of trees or throwing a brick at a tree, missing, and hitting a car or person, I'm guessing.  The ice box law I can actually give you some insight on since it was a big issue at one point. Abandoned icebox law was created because there was a time, around the 50's, when kids would play around those things, crawl into them, and lock themselves in.  They'd end up dying from suffocation, dehydration or any other reason that comes from being locked in a box for a few days in Texas heat.    Source for the interested"
sanantonio,3ba6mf,ResoundingGolfClap,5,Sat Jun 27 17:39:28 2015 UTC,"Refrigerator death:       Refrigerator death refers to death by suffocation in a refrigerator or similar device such as a freezer. Such deaths were not uncommon for children in the United States before the passage of the Refrigerator Safety Act in 1956.    Children would occasionally play in abandoned refrigerators and become trapped due to the fact that the doors were secured shut by latches that could only be opened by the handle on the outside. The first reactions to the deaths were to ask people not to abandon refrigerators and to detach the doors of unused refrigerators. In the mid to late 1950s troops of people would sometimes search out abandoned refrigerators, detaching the doors and smashing the locks. However, these efforts were not entirely effective, and children were still dying inside of refrigerators that had not been found and dismantled. The continued occurrence of refrigerator deaths led to a law that required a change in the way refrigerator doors stay shut. The act applied to all refrigerators manufactured in the United States after October 31, 1958, and is largely responsible for the adoption of the magnetic mechanism that is used today instead of a latch.

I already have a problem with some family members who throw greasy and unrinsed plastic containers and cans into the recycle bin. I suspect that at the recycling plant they can't use a gloppy yogurt cup or a chill encrusted tin can. Probably by the time they get it that stuff has gone moldy.    If the trash bin size is lowered then there is going to be more pizza boxes in the recycle bin even though the city has said in the past that they can't recycle the cardboard from pizza boxes because of the cheese  residue.     I wish the local news would take a trip out to the recycling plants and show us what happens to all of the things they receive. Is it really all recycled ?

Or perhaps the kid is mad at his father for another reason and is bright enough to know how to cause a problem. Have seen that as well.  The first person to question a child concerning an alleged abuse incident must have proper training and the session should always be video taped for analysis.  The pitfalls are many.

Taylor has no leverage with anyone right now. She's managed to alienate six of ten city council votes. She hasn't been in office a month and is already the lamest of ducks. Of course, that won't stop her from claiming credit for every pothole that finds itself filled over the next two years."

Lazy ass can try to prove me wrong, but he won't be able to and will just slink off.  But yeah. Your assertion I have some sort of duty to source anything when challenged is what is ridiculous."

Or allow you impose some bullshit burden of proof on me.  And he is lazy. Before I challenge someone, I make sure I have my shit in a sock, taking the time to do the research. I don't just toss off, ""prove it,"" sit back, and wait for some stranger to educate me.  If his head isn't too far up his ass, he might pick up a paper and learn something about local government. Perhaps he may even learn how to spell evidence and euphemism or in the alternative use spell check. Or not.  And last I checked, I was typing online - not shouting.   Are you familiar with what ""they"" say about assumptions?  So whatevs indeed."

The EN has a few decent reporters left, clinging to journalism like a starving babe sucking at a shriveled tit.

If youre dead set on the theme park, do Fiesta Texas instead. They have a live band with their singers on a nicely set stage before their firework display.

sanantonio,3b0q44,ubmt1861,2,Thu Jun 25 07:49:08 2015 UTC,106.7 seems to be the same as KZEP.
sanantonio,3b0q44,bigjnsa,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:29:48 2015 UTC,I think it's better.
sanantonio,3b0q44,texasroadkill,2,Thu Jun 25 18:15:21 2015 UTC,Interesting. I really didn't think 106.7 would have that much of an effect on KZEP.   And I guess it's all in what you're used to. I came to San Antonio a little more than five years ago and quite liked KZEP. I thought it was pretty cool that they played the likes of Judas Priest and Iron Maiden as opposed to the same old Stairway-to-Hotel-Freebird rotation that every other classic rock station that I had heard up to that point.
sanantonio,3b0q44,Strait409,0,Thu Jun 25 14:13:02 2015 UTC,Good riddance. They played the same shit over and over again. holy hell.
sanantonio,3b0q44,airbrat,4,Thu Jun 25 11:38:49 2015 UTC,"It was a classic rock station... of course they played the same content repeatedly.   What did you want, for them to play some techno or college indie alternative?"
sanantonio,3b0q44,FrostMute,-6,Thu Jun 25 17:38:01 2015 UTC,"LOL! Holy shit! Techno? College indie? Are you implying I'm a fucking kid?   Tell ya what if you're ok with hearing AC/DCs' Highway to Hell, Journey's Don't Stop Believing and Aerosmith's Dream On over and over again then knock yourself out.   FYI, I'm well aware this is a 'classic rock' station. But you are aware there are hundreds upon hundreds of songs rarely played. RATT, DOKKEN, MOTLEY CRUE, TWISTED SISTER, the list goes on and on."
sanantonio,3b0q44,airbrat,0,Fri Jun 26 04:01:54 2015 UTC,"RATT, DOKKEN, MOTLEY CRUE, TWISTED SISTER   With the exception of TS, quantity does not equal quality."

All I gotta do is preemptively call the DA and divulge info that should be between only myself and my attorney to get away with murder? How is running your mouth off to anyone who isn't your lawyer considered ""privileged""? He fucking voluntarily opened his mouth. He chose to forgo that confidentiality. What the actual fuck? Was he a former client of nico before he was appointed DA?  I understand he will still be prosecuted but it's odd to think the DA has to recuse himself and his office from doing it when they're the best people equipped to do so. Anyone got some insight into this?"
sanantonio,3b1crq,nixvex,2,Thu Jun 25 18:09:35 2015 UTC,"If you read the article again you'll notice they state that the officer called LaHood while LaHood was still a private defense attorney and they had a conversation that is protected by Attorney Client confidentiality. So since LaHood is now the DA and he knows all this stuff from before he was the DA, he can't ethically prosecute the case, he knows stuff he's not supposed to."
sanantonio,3b1crq,SnoopyTRB,2,Fri Jun 26 17:55:19 2015 UTC,You're correct. I read it again and must have missed the part about Nico still being a defense attorney at the time. That website is a mess on mobile. Apparently he's recused over 300 potential cases due to the same issue. I understand the conflict of interest. Thank you for pointing that out. Much appreciated.
sanantonio,3b1crq,nixvex,2,Fri Jun 26 18:05:58 2015 UTC,"yeah, that site is a mess on mobile. Hopefully the justice system will work its way through all the people he's consulted with prior to being DA pretty quickly so he can stop recusing himself."
sanantonio,3b0erc,excoriator,8,Wed Jun 24 23:31:52 2015 UTC,"I find it a lot better than what we previously had, but still very underwhelming.

With that said, if any help is needed as far as graphics and CSS/html, I'd be happy to do what I can."
sanantonio,3b0erc,ImNotChineseOk,2,Thu Jun 25 01:04:23 2015 UTC,The top post covers about half of the header photo   I assumed that was by design.
sanantonio,3b0erc,fiddlechick,-1,Thu Jun 25 17:39:39 2015 UTC,That is correct. It's the normal design for Naut. I believe the Large Header option can be used to show the whole picture without covering half of it.

sanantonio,3b0erc,registerthisjerk,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:39:56 2015 UTC,The photo/video expander button is tiny and fades into the background.    I'm not sure why you decided to make everything smaller and less legible but it is the opposite of proper UX/UI design.  also please fix the shortcut text at the top only being fully visible on hover.
sanantonio,3b0erc,JDS89,0,Thu Jul 2 21:53:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks for feedback...   I'll see if we can make the photo/video button bigger and more noticeable.   We'll darken the shortcut text, too.  I need to get more feedback on the text size and let the mods make a decision there.   Thanks!!"
sanantonio,3b0erc,ilp391,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:51:24 2015 UTC,"Personally, I would like better contrasting colors. White with light gray for the comments doesn't really go well together and kinda hurts the eyes a bit. However, everything else is great. I like animations and is much more visually appealing. Great work!"
sanantonio,3b0erc,RazorINC,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:44:45 2015 UTC,That's why I can only read some subs on a mobile device. I'm too old to strain my eyes on non contrasting text.
sanantonio,3b0erc,StabAntonio,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:57:19 2015 UTC,So /r/gis looks pretty similar to the new design we have incorporated. The one recommendation I would like to make would be to make more space for the banner image like they have it set up in /r/gis

sanantonio,3b0erc,StabAntonio,-1,Mon Jun 29 16:27:59 2015 UTC,"Honestly, Naut is really generic if you don't do any actual customization to it. Based on the new design, this sub could be for any city and it looks like every other sub using the almost-unchanged Naut style. The old design wasn't perfect, but at least it had the Alamo and was easily recognizable as the San Antonio sub."
sanantonio,3b0erc,StabAntonio,-1,Sun Jul 5 20:33:47 2015 UTC,"I think we can work with this theme and make it look san antonio. Regardless, we are still on reddit, it's not a custom designed theme. That might cost $$$$$ and we don't need to go down that road!!"
sanantonio,3b0erc,pauliedigi,-2,Sat Jun 27 15:08:34 2015 UTC,I think it could be done without spending money. The new header image is a great start. Incorporating the rose window like /u/TXfishing suggested is another great idea.
sanantonio,3b0erc,StabAntonio,-1,Thu Jun 25 14:39:09 2015 UTC,"Slightly off-topic, but is there any chance we can get the permissions to the wiki changed so that trusted users in this sub can update it? The meetup page, things-to-do page, and moving page could all use an update and I wouldn't expect our 1 active mod to do it by himself."
sanantonio,3b0erc,rockrolla,3,Fri Jun 26 04:53:01 2015 UTC,The permissions are already set to allow trusted users to edit. It's just a matter of determining who else should be added to the list of trusted users. Sounds like a good discussion to have in a future sticky thread.
sanantonio,3b0erc,shutdown-t0-r,0,Fri Jun 26 06:37:24 2015 UTC,"I think that's a good idea. Just looking at the histories of the pages, it appears that only mods have ever updated the wiki pages linked in the sidebar."
sanantonio,3az2q9,coastlines,4,Wed Jun 24 17:30:33 2015 UTC,"We've seen evidence of this, in regards to Google Fiber, already.  Google just recently had the city limits of San Antonio added to their SICFA (http://interchange.puc.state.tx.us/WebApp/Interchange/Documents/44756_5_852446.PDF) and they've been posting jobs (at least for City Manager) for San Antonio Google Fiber as well.  This shows, to me, that they're creeping carefully but that they are still very interested in doing fiber in San Antonio.  Now, I expect that if they find it too difficult or costly to do fiber, according to the engineering firms they hired, then I can see them walking away quite easily as well.  I just hope that they don't decide to do fiber but limit it to a smaller area of San Antonio, like just doing it downtown."
sanantonio,3az2q9,shutdown-t0-r,2,Wed Jun 24 18:20:24 2015 UTC,"Downtown seems too limited to me.  Downtown has virtually no residential areas, although it would be a big draw for businesses.  I think limiting it to within Loop 410 would be reasonable."
sanantonio,3az2q9,hankhillforprez,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:34:24 2015 UTC,"I would love it was on the Far West Side, my fear is that, like what /u/hankhillforprez said, it will be limited to an area like 410.  Hopefully Google looks at where the middle to high income residential areas are and focus on those.  The reason I said downtown is because it always seems like all the focus in San Antonio is placed downtown even though not many actually live there."
sanantonio,3az2q9,shutdown-t0-r,0,Thu Jun 25 12:05:35 2015 UTC,"I think it should be limited to the Far West Side, probably for the same reason /u/shutdown-t0-r thinks it should be downtown. ;-)"

sanantonio,3b1l3s,cplax15,4,Thu Jun 25 07:43:23 2015 UTC,"Like any other big city, San Antonio has a LONG list of both pros and cons.  Overall it's a great place to live though.  BIGGEST ISSUE:  Allergies!!!!  I cannot stress this enough... If you have allergies to juniper/ash/cedar... do not move here.  If you have allergies to oak and mold, highly reconsider moving here."
sanantonio,3b1l3s,Smitty--81--,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:23:47 2015 UTC,Luckily I have little to no allergies. Glad I made the cut.
sanantonio,3b1l3s,Smitty--81--,3,Thu Jun 25 22:27:58 2015 UTC,"That's good to hear because the allergies here are literally (statistically tracked) some of the worst in the entire nation.  San Antonio has typical large city problems like infrastructure being overwhelmed by the pace of growth, crime, rush hour traffic even though I don't think it's as bad as most large cities, however the drivers here are some of the worst I've ever dealt with (and I've been to about 20 states and a dozen countries).  I will say car insurance may go up for you.  Despite San Antonio being relatively less expensive to live than other large cities, one in five cars on the road is an uninsured driver so car insurance here is OUTRAGEOUS.  Mine doubled moving here from Colorado.  I avoid serious car accidents daily and I am personally allergic to mountain cedar.  So I HATE November through March.  All in all my family loves the theme parks and nature centers and museums and activities.  You MUST do the natural bridge caverns and the glass bottom boat tour if you move here.  The ocean is a few hours away, and hill country has a ton of small town getaway places to eat and explore.  The weather here is simply amazing, it's brutally hot mid June through September but it's so, so, so, perfect the whole rest of the year.  The schools here are hit and miss though, do your research if you have young kids.  Compared to other large cities (say 10 biggest in America) San Antonio is simply the best choice.  I prefer small towns and am looking forward to moving away (I'm a military transplant) but I have no complaints about San Antonio except for the terrible drivers and my stupid allergy to mountain cedar."
sanantonio,3b1l3s,ebackhus,2,Thu Jun 25 23:18:39 2015 UTC,I didn't know I had any until I moved here.
sanantonio,3b1l3s,Guruking,2,Fri Jun 26 03:13:52 2015 UTC,I had no allergies for the first 10 years. Now Flonase is my best friend.
sanantonio,3b1l3s,Robdiesel_dot_com,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:56:03 2015 UTC,"Don't say that and jinx yourself.  I've never had allergies (lived on a few continents and a few countries and in a few states). Los Angeles? No allergies. Denver? None. Never a problem.   Moved here, though I was dying.  Until I realized it was allergies.  I have experimented with lots of OTC meds and found one from Costco that works ($15/year, it's 365 pills) and then I nab a sample inhaler from an allergist which will sort my ""exercise-induced asthma"" that I also developed once I moved here.   Otherwise, lots of good advice.  Be careful with the cost of living. People say it's cheap, but coming from Denver I was in for a shock.  Allergies - if you develop them, that can set you back a good amount for medication. Air quality here is SHITE! COnsider that if you have kids or if you're a smoker. Things can get ugly for you.  Water quality: Shite! You need a water softener, or be prepared to replace dish washers, coffee makers, shower heads, and the never-ending black mold growing in tubs and toilets. Even WITH the softener, I wish for more filtering as the water is still shite, but at least the laundry gets clean and dishes too.   Medical insurance: even good companies here tend to offer insurance that costs you a lot and doesn't cover a lot (from my limited sample of friends and other people)  Car insurace: Already covered. It's high here because you NEED uninsured/underinsured, and theft/vandalism. You'll understand once you spend a few days in traffic here.  Taxes:  There's no state income tax, but they make up for it with insane property taxes. If you don't buy a house, you'll be ok.  Sales taxes and stuff are near 9%, so that stings.  Utilities: Since you're already used to running the A/C all the time, it might not be that bad for you, but oddly enough, not all houses are built energy efficient. Lots of old houses have single-pane windows and aluminum frames. Heat comes in. Electric can set you back several hundred a month in the summer.  Winters are down in the 30's so you'll run the heater, but that's far cheaper.  Climate:  The humidity is bad! Summers are warm, but generally not that hot. Record temps have broken 100F with July/August being the hottest.  Winters are cool, spring would be nice but humidity spikes, then summer heat picks up.  Rain falls in the spring.  Motorcycling here is a very VERY short season (you get soaked in sweat in your gear instantly, no lane splitting in the heat will kill you too).  From frequent rides and other trips to the California desert, trust me, the San Antonio heat is quite different from the dry desert heat. I suggest you come here in the next few weeks and rent a car and hang out for a bit to feel it. I much prefer the Phoenix 110F over this.   Mexican food: If that's your thing, it's COMPLETELY different here to what it is in the Southwest. TexMex is like bland Mexican food. Several people in this sub have recommendations for ""California-style"" mexican if you want a little kick in it and the flavor you're used to.  I'm not the right person to talk about city life, but San Antonio is the 31st largest city in the US, so many of the amenities you can think of are available here. You don't have world famous art/museums/restaurants/mass transit, BUT what you have is lots of friendly people and some immigrant areas that allow for great sushi, great Indian food, great Thai and some other stuff.  Austin isn't far off if there's a concert of a big artist coming to Texas. They generally get to at least Austin, so you can catch them.  Lots of big acts have been here locally, so we're not completely snowed in when it comes to entertainment.  I definitely suggest renting first. Depending on where you find work, want to live etc. you want to get here first and then find a place. Renting can be a lot cheaper, not only for the tax savings on property, but with the humidity and rain (rain is usually in downpours, so leaks and mold are both common) you get rotted wood and decks/roofing needing repairs etc. Also, A/C repairs can be spendy because they are usually urgent.  I may seem glum, but all the negatives are what I want to hear when I move places. The good parts will be apparent in short order. :D  Welcome!"
sanantonio,3b1l3s,riadfodig,3,Sun Jun 28 06:50:24 2015 UTC,"Seems weird to come to Texas to avoid the heat, but I've never experienced a vegas summer. As to weather, San Antonio does get hot. 110°F is usually about the highest it will get, but this year has been unusually mild (high in the low 90's currently). The humidity right now is also very unusual.  Activities: The greenway trails are neat (especially Leon Creek) if you like to run/bike on paved paths, and I hear there's a lot of MTB trails too if that's your thing. Government Canyon is awesome for some peace and quiet, and it's a pretty short drive from anywhere on the north/northwest side."

There's more to it, though - I hate Nevada for many reasons. I am just not a desert person (I originally come from East Coast: humidity...etc). I miss rain. I miss normal seasons. I hate this dry, direct heat + I really need a place with an elevator. Does it rain much in SA?"
sanantonio,3b1l3s,cyvaquero,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:29:33 2015 UTC,"Not usually much rain here, although we've broken some local records this year for rainfall. I've heard complaints that fall and spring aren't always very pronounced, but I don't mind it."
sanantonio,3b1l3s,Robdiesel_dot_com,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:40:56 2015 UTC,"I hear you on the not being a desert person, lived 3 year in Yuma and have a house in northwestern NM (desert and it freezes, my two least favorite things). San Antonio is tree covered though it is mostly low growth Live Oak, TX Mt Laurel, and the aforementioned Cedar. Hill Country is a transition zone so you also have your desert growth, agave, cacti, chollas, yucca, etc - along with associated wildlife. You can always travel a couple hours west if you ever miss the desert.  I'll take SA heat/humidity over the dry hot desert any day."
sanantonio,3b1l3s,PenPenGuin,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:05:35 2015 UTC,"Does it rain much in SA?   Not much, but you don't get the week-long misty drizzle. It's usually 30 minutes of downpour and nothing for another month.   Have you considered moving to Colorado? Anywhere along the Front Range will give you mild climate, winters with occasional snow, warm summers but rarely hot enough to need A/C. Dry climate too, so you don't get sticky. Fresh air, etc."
sanantonio,3b1l3s,Unable13,2,Sun Jun 28 06:52:17 2015 UTC,"So the biggest change will be that you'd need to start thinking of Vegas as somewhere to go to get into the big entertainment life.  San Antonio is surrounded by cities like Houston (which is larger), and Austin (which is ""hipper""), so a lot of small-to-moderate-sized entertainment troupes will skip over SA in favor of those other cities.  The big single-shot shows will also select the other cities as venues (such as multi-day music festivals).  Living in San Antonio would be sort of similar to living in a Vegas-proximity suburb that's 60 to 80 miles away from the strip. You will not get anywhere near the food choices available in Vegas, but you also won't be (generally) paying $60+ a meal either.   Weather-wise you're not gaining much, honestly. The stupid-highs in Vegas when it hits 114 ~ 120 won't happen over here, but we generally have multiple 100+ days (we usually top out around 105 though - higher temps are abnormal even for us). However, this is when that whole ""dry heat vs wet heat"" thing comes into play. 114 in Vegas on the cement when there's 0% humidity is horrible.  100 in San Antonio with 60% humidity is worse, in my opinion.  Our winters are worse than Vegas - it does get cold enough to freeze, we do get slushy sleetish-snow-things now and then as well, and that's when the weather gets seriously moody.  It can be a high of 80 and a low of 65 on Tuesday, and a high of 35 and a low of 28 on Thursday.   The biggest thing about San Antonio vs Vegas for me is that San Antonio is slower. It feels more homey, and like somewhere where ""settling down"" is a lifestyle rather than a goal. I still go to Vegas on vacation, but after a week on the strip, I'm ready to go into a nice dark room and stare at my lawn for a few days."
sanantonio,3b1l3s,bryanwendland,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:25:19 2015 UTC,"I am all for entertainment. I'm not huge on concerts and venues; I mostly like like restaurants or quiet bars to have drinks with friends. What I truly need is an apartment with an elevator. And there are only 3 apartments in Vegas with elevators, and all are 2x my budget. Gotta get outta here! I hate the desert."
sanantonio,3b1l3s,bryanwendland,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:30:51 2015 UTC,now when you say an apartment with an elevator you mean the building itself needs an elevator for handicap access or are you talking about a 2 floor apartment/condo?

I live near the DoSeum (new children's museum) about a 15/20 minutes walk north of the Pearl shopping, eating etc district and I couldn't be happier with the location. I've found this city has something for everyone; Sports, entertainment, history, music (although with Austin right up the interstate, many of the bands I'd love to see here skip this city on their Texas tours...), the great outdoors, and the list goes on.  I will say I wish city gov't (and maybe county, too... I'm not sure how intertwined the two are on this) would get its act together on public transit/ride share. And I'm not even talking about building a light rail. There are plenty of things the city could do to make it easier for locals to not have to hop in their cars to get from place to place in the city.   You're not going to avoid the heat, but at least it won't be a shock to you coming from Vegas.  That's my ""one-month-in"" opinion on San Antonio."

sanantonio,3b1l3s,Villaintine,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:31:39 2015 UTC,"San Antonio is definitely a tourist city, but downtown is really for everyone. The riverwalk particularly is a super tourist trap, but it extends beyond downtown both north and south and those outer edges of the riverwalk are awesome. Downtown is going through something of a revitalization and by 2020 (major park project going on at the location of the '68 World Fair) it could be a really, really, really awesome place for locals as opposed to just an awesome place.   The area I live in is north of downtown by the Pearl (north of that too, but not too much). I have to take a car pretty much everywhere I want to go except the Pearl, but that's really my only major problem with San Antonio is it's not that walkable."
sanantonio,3b1l3s,Robdiesel_dot_com,2,Fri Jun 26 01:39:15 2015 UTC,It may not be as hot here.  The humidity will make up for that.

You can blast your a/c on full here but as soon as you start doing any kind of physical activity inside you are going to be uncomfortable.  The humidity makes this place miserable, I cannot tell you how much I miss the desert weather.  There you can stand in the shade and cool down, that doesn't happen here.  It's like carrying around a damp wool blanket in a sauna over your head at all times."

As part of the Army corps of engineers, he built hundreds of miles of roads in and out of San Antonio. Roads the city used to become a more prominent city in a very young Texas."

I think historical value and Lee, as a person, warrant his memory being preserved in the school's name, but everything around this is absurd. The historical revisionism being flaunted over the purpose of secession, needs to be criticized and called out. There is no debate on why states seceded. They left us all the proof we needed:.  To say ""it wasn't about slavery, it was about the economy"" is disingenuous bullshit.   I know you're not saying this, but many are and it needs to be confronted."

sanantonio,3awy07,not_thrilled,7,Wed Jun 24 11:07:50 2015 UTC,"And then you have the flip side of the story - people who drive 5 mph under the speed limit, no matter what the speed limit is, who drive at or under the speed limit in the left lane on the freeway even if there's a line of cars behind them. Driving in SA is a very frustrating experience."
sanantonio,3awy07,lagster,5,Wed Jun 24 12:29:10 2015 UTC,"This. I should be able to drive fast in the left lane, but most days I can't because this city doesn't understand the unwritten rules of the left lane. Ive also noticed when San Antonians enter the freeway they try and get left as many lanes as possible leaving the right most lane open for going fast.    Lights on in the rain please!"

sanantonio,3awy07,rrasco09,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:15:18 2015 UTC,The funny part is when people drive like that swerving around everyone and then a few minutes later you pull up next to them at a stop light.  All that aggressive driving and dangerous maneuvers didn't even save them any time (and probably burned more fuel).
sanantonio,3awy07,SycoJack,3,Thu Jun 25 16:34:53 2015 UTC,"People that drive while intoxicated or text while driving piss me the fuck off.   My mother and sister are very bad about both of those. What's worse is that they try to claim they're not intoxicated or that they aren't too distracted.   I'm not sure if they're lying to me, lying to themselves or just that fucking stupid. And all three of those are pet peeves of mine."

Last week a guy in an old beat up truck was inches away from hitting my rear bumper as he changed lanes aggressively on Basse. That in itself was scary, but when we were both at the light a couple of minutes before I had been able to smell the joint he was sucking on every two seconds. Don't know how he was even able to drive."

sanantonio,3azlqs,ResoundingGolfClap,3,Wed Jun 24 19:50:51 2015 UTC,"I've been to the JW Marriott a few times along with watching the Valero Open the last two years and just being on the grounds is breathtaking. They definitely didn't skimp on anything when it came to building this place.   As for the golf course, it is very very nice. I enjoyed it a lot. I've played the Canyons course. Keep in mind I am seriously the worst golfer this world has seen but I enjoyed the company and playing for an afternoon. We went during the afternoon in July so there weren't many people risking heat strokes like us so we didn't run upon anyone or have anyone on our heels. I'd say it's definitely worth the cash. I enjoyed the course because you think you're fixing to come across an easy hole and it totally throws you for a loop where you have to make some smart on the fly decisions.   Id go for it."

sanantonio,3azlqs,pauliedigi,2,Thu Jun 25 03:28:47 2015 UTC,It's a pretty cool experience but the golf courses are VERY difficult. The Canyons is definitely more manageable. I think it's worth going out there at least once to see where the pros play.
sanantonio,3aymm8,mactacularcheese,5,Wed Jun 24 15:34:34 2015 UTC,I think starting a conversation thread about how redditors feel about the Stars and Rampage would be more productive than having people fill out a survey. You would get a better response forsure.

sanantonio,3aymm8,Ray240315,3,Wed Jun 24 15:50:56 2015 UTC,1) women's basketball isn't very popular among most basketball fans. I would say the nba largely over shadows the wnba. Also the Spurs are this cities life blood.  2) people down here don't care for hockey :/
sanantonio,3aymm8,fiddlechick,2,Wed Jun 24 15:53:07 2015 UTC,"If the Spurs are the city's life blood, you would think that would carry over to the other teams in the San Antonio Sports & Entertainment portfolio.   Sure the Stars aren't as exciting as the Spurs, and we suck but it's a cheap event to attend and get out of the house.   On the other hand, I love Rampage games and hockey. Hockey is such a fun sport that doesn't receive adequate air time on national TV because it doesn't have as many opportunities for commercials which generate revenue. Not being accessible to the general public is a deal breaker for any sport. I guarantee if NBC started showing hockey games once a week, more people would get into it."

Every time that belt made contact..SLAP!!!  The entire crowd would moan, OOOOO! You couldn't hear him screaming with the napkin in his mouth, but the rest of his face told the story of complete WTF'ness.    It was epic but we eventually said OK this is fucked up.

sanantonio,3aqd11,rrasco09,12,Mon Jun 22 19:38:40 2015 UTC,"There are two questions before the court. 1. Do state's have to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples and 2. Do states have to recognize out of state same-sex marriages.  However they answer, that is the final say.  BUT states can try to pass new laws to further delay the process. Texas tried to in the last legislative session by barring clerks from issuing same-sex marriage licenses and withholding their pay if they did. That did not pass. The state DID pass though a law that protects clergy from having to officiate the ceremony.  In short, SCOTUS is the last word. But certain states will try to fight."
sanantonio,3aqd11,cyvaquero,5,Mon Jun 22 20:05:05 2015 UTC,"It depends how broad the SCOTUS wants to make this ruling, if they just decide the case without a mandate then we are still another year off. I think though that this is the year. Unlike previous years there are 32 states which have legalized gay marriage (significant since there were 16 states with anti-miscegenation laws when Loving v. Virginia was decided) and this year there are two gay marriage related cases on the docket which means the SCOTUS has to be very careful how they rule in order not step on each other. If the SCOTUS rules in the spirit of Loving - there is nothing the states can do and all existing laws are immediately null, no appeals.  Like you said, states can try to enact new laws, but those will be immediately challenged and declared unconstitutional in District court (with a court ordered stay of the law, so marriages will be going on throughout the process) with the Circuit courts referring any appeals back to the District ruling.

sanantonio,3apb4u,wideawakefordays,9,Mon Jun 22 12:04:45 2015 UTC,"The NerdWallet report found San Antonio lagged overall in terms of crime and school performance. However, the Alamo City performed favorably against Austin, Dallas, and Houston in average commute times and unemployment rate.   So the bottom line is that the ranking depends on what you measure. We do have some downright lousy school districts and we do have more crime than we should. All this ranking means is that SA still has some things to work on, things that this ranking considered to be crucial to livability."
sanantonio,3apb4u,excoriator,5,Mon Jun 22 13:03:41 2015 UTC,The data on crime is pretty scary when you look at it.  http://www.city-data.com/crime/crime-San-Antonio-Texas.html  And then you remember the SAPD wants more money and to keep their extremely generous benefits... How do you make the city come to terms with the disparity between the level of compensation given and the amount/quality of services being rendered?
sanantonio,3apb4u,sfoxy,8,Mon Jun 22 13:39:35 2015 UTC,"That particular aggregation makes it scary. We do have an above average amount of burglary and theft in the city, but my understanding is that we're not above average for violent crime and most of the violent crime is either gang-related or domestic. There aren't a lot of random stranger attacks, and we know about those outliers when they happen because TV news makes a huge deal about them."
sanantonio,3apb4u,excoriator,3,Mon Jun 22 13:44:35 2015 UTC,"I don't know man. We've been hiding behind this petty crime argument for awhile now. We're above average with murders, rapes, and GTA... That's scary no matter what spin you put on it."
sanantonio,3apb4u,sfoxy,2,Mon Jun 22 15:46:44 2015 UTC,I don't see a comparison to the mean on that page.  I'll grant you that there is no acceptable number of those crimes you listed.

Yet alcohol is constantly given a pass and nothing is done to prevent it from happening again and again. Heck it's advertised everywhere and with all sports teams. But marijuana is seen as the worst of the worst, absolutely crazy the drug laws come from a time we knew so little. I wonder what would happen if alcohol, tobacco and marijuana were all grouped together and either they are all legal or illegal.

Something like BRCC (Bandera Road Community Church) which is now called City Church as it has spread out to a few other locations is pretty good and caters to a younger crowd. I prefer the saturday night times because i'm not a morning person. Just depends on what side of town you're on. www.brcc.net  is the primary website that links to the other locations as well.   However there are other decent non denominational churches around and if you can provide a rough side of town or close intersection we can maybe help narrow it down?

I'm looking for something along the lines of a taper fade with an undercut. Any barber I should request in particular?

They do a mean taper, cuts are $20, they both do walk ins, but appointments are preferred but they never turn down a walk in, they're closed Sunday-Monday.   If you're into hip hop and BMW's then you'll find something to talk with them, but they're both cool guys, I've known them since before Chris opened Refresh and never got a bad cut."

sanantonio,3agpo5,braeden0613,3,Sat Jun 20 05:01:34 2015 UTC,"When I lived in the ghetto, my car was broken into (windows shattered a few times) because the perpetrator saw I had left change in the center console.  After that I learned it was better to remove all valuables from the car, and to leave my doors unlocked to save myself from the window repair cost."
sanantonio,3agpo5,Leigh_Cheri,4,Sat Jun 20 06:05:30 2015 UTC,Because replacing broken glass is expensive
sanantonio,3agpo5,HomicideSS,7,Sat Jun 20 08:15:53 2015 UTC,I always leave my truck doors unlocked.  I've had the window shattered before and if someone really wants in they'll take what they want and cause enough damage for you to pay out of pocket (deductible was higher than the cost of replacing the window myself).  I also don't leave anything of value in my truck.  Just a different view point for you.

sanantonio,3agpo5,ebackhus,1 point,Sun Jun 21 03:59:46 2015 UTC,"I didn't mean to, but it was my jeep anyways.  Most people leave them unlocked so they don't slash your window.

Totally my fault on that front, but I don't keep anything in there so luckily no loss."

sanantonio,3akisp,lizardlemonbreath,8,Sun Jun 21 03:32:32 2015 UTC,"If you are legitimately struggling with this, I would recommend finding a counselor to speak to instead of a church. Understanding one's sexuality isn't easy and a counselor will be less judgmental than many churches you'll find here. They're not too hard to find and if you don't like your counselor, you can always find a different one. The only downside is that they charge for their services, but I believe some health insurance plans cover them.    If you're dead set on a church, go for it. I'm not trying to debate the religious side of it, just making a suggestion."
sanantonio,3akisp,StabAntonio,3,Sun Jun 21 03:04:06 2015 UTC,"Bethany UCC - The UCC is basically the hippy of churches, they ordained their first openly gay pastor in the 70s and authorized their pastors to perform gay marriages as soon as the first state legalized it. I don't think they have any conversion therapy, they just accept you as you are.  I should note that I don't have personal experience with Bethany, however I grew up in the UCC and saw their pastor was present in the protest to support the NDO so even though it's a decentralized church they appear to follow the synods."
sanantonio,3akisp,cyvaquero,4,Sun Jun 21 18:59:28 2015 UTC,"Hey man, it sounds like you are really struggling here. On the one hand you know you are physically attracted to men, on the other hand this goes against your beliefs. That is an incredibly difficult place to be.  It looks like you are looking to change your sexuality. As a psychotherapist I can tell you that the research demonstrates that the success rates for people trying to change their sexuality are not good. In fact, conversion therapy is largely considered unethical. Faith-based approaches do not seem to stick. Ever hear of Exodus International? They actually decided to shut their ministry down because they were doing more harm than good to people.  So if changing your sexuality is not a likely scenario, your options are to a) maintain your belief system and deny any acting on your sexuality, or b) modify your belief system to accept that your sexuality is a part of you that isn't going away and is perfectly normal. There are plenty of churches that are inclusive of LGBT folks. You might explore their theology to see what you think. There are also, of course, belief systems outside of Christianity that are also inclusive. You might want to explore those. Personally, I don't see how if there was a God how he would deem sinful something that does no harm to anyone. But it doesn't matter what I think. This is a journey only you can go on, should you choose to.  Good luck."
sanantonio,3akisp,FreethinkingMFT,2,Sun Jun 21 15:45:42 2015 UTC,"Can you clarify what you mean by change? Do you want a church that will accept you for who you are, or actually change your orientation?"

We listed our stuff way cheap, and got offers for 50% or less of our asking price.  C. People committing to buy but never showing up. Awesome, considering randoms now know where we live.  D. People asking for details that were clearly listed in the description. As if they just looked at the pics without reading the posts.   CL was an absolute waste of time. We wound up putting all of our stuff on 5miles. Everything we put up there sold with almost zero problems.   CL did teach us to give our address to people only when they say they're on their way here, though. So at least we learned little lesson."

I argued, no way that is,really going out of our way (i10 to and from Houston). Plus SA does have things to do with out the over hype of Austin.   SA was so fricking chill. Art Museum and Japanese tea garden were fun and free! Mexican food reccomendation made by other redditos was great and it seemed there were possible some distinct food trucks.   Everyone who's ever been in Texas can pretty much sau they've been to Austin and they've all done the same things, but SA is a different experience that only a few can really enjoy and appreciate.   My friend and I look forward to returning and exploring more.

You might want to call somewhere local like 'devils backbone tavern' to see if there are any road closures on your way because there has been recent flooding.

Real Ale and Shiner Breweries are within a half days drive. Nice vineyards nearby as well if you're into that. Ranger creek distillery.   It's warm enough to do tubing down the guadalupe river in new braunfels/Gruene. A quick google search should give you some options. Maybe rent a boat on canyon lake

What part of town are you staying in?   hings to do/see downtown:   The Alamo The riverwalk (be prepared, it's not a ""river"" as most people imagine one) If you can take in a show at the Majestic Theater, it's beautiful inside. Ripley's Believe it or Not (I heard it got expensive, though)   Near downtown is the Pearl Brewery District - lots of food/bars, shops etc.. a hip, up and coming part of SA.  South of downtown are the ghost tracks - a little bit of fun mixed with a long-time local legend.   There's good Mexican food all over in the city, but not all mexican restaurants are good.  another vote for the missions.  Sea World / Six Flags can be fun if you have younger kids.. Tejas rodeo company (far north, off of Blanco Rd) puts on a rodeo most Saturday nights, i think.  Schlitterbahn in New Braunfels is one of the best water parks in the country."

Some good places to eat: Two Bros BBQ No Tierra Gristmill as stated above Magnolia pancake haus Five Guys burgers if you haven't been there for quick eats That's what I have on the top of my head.

sanantonio,3a4lpt,UNBR34K4BL3,2,Wed Jun 17 19:02:45 2015 UTC,"Floating in the river up in San Marcos is excellent, especially if you go on a weekday. Definitely go to the missions, especially because I'm assuming that y'all are going to go see the Alamo. The Missions are much cooler, and have better historical context provided for their presence in San Antonio. Also, they're less crowded. Eat as many tacos as you possibly can. Regio cafe on McCullough is an Excellent hole in the wall, open for breakfast and lunch on Monday-Saturday. Taco Taco is also really popular. Riverwalk Mexican food is decent, but super overpriced. The San Antonio Museum of Art is my personal favorite Museum in the city. So much of the city's culture comes through in the contemporary art."

sanantonio,3a3402,Otter_Actual,6,Wed Jun 17 04:08:02 2015 UTC,"Instead of turning the already existing, CPS owned fiber system on to benefit the people of San Antonio and make progress towards ending the digital divide, city council is selling this municipal asset worth millions (potentially billions in economic gain if used to its full potential as municipal broadband) to Verizon for a 250k pittance. Good for Verizon. Bad for those of us who want decent internet access at reasonable cost. We're supposed to sit back and think it's a brilliant idea which is why they waited until three days before the vote to reveal this master plan. Very TPP of them. Another day, another dollar if you're lucky, another disappointing decision by our hallowed city leaders. Now where did I put my craft beer?"

Did you even read the article or did you just skimmed it and take random keywords and then formulated your hypothesis.
sanantonio,3a3402,sweetbutstupid,2,Wed Jun 17 16:00:45 2015 UTC,"Read it four times in disbelief. The district 8 staffer who came up with this farce is a particularly douchey bag.  Yes, realize it is only a fraction of the system's capacity and yes, it is only for a while, but still.  Feel free to google the council agenda for tomorrow, read the craptastic document that is the Master Lease Agreement in its soporific entirety, and tell me how city council is supposed to make an informed decision with only three days notice.  Considering Koch bro $$$ paid for Ivy Taylor's campaign phone banking and that same dirty tea party cash is bankrolling her birthday bacchanal at the Lambermont Chateau tonight, I can't help but think allowing a corporation to monetize SAABN before the people who paid for the fiber in the first place get access is pretty tone deaf even for Poison Ivy, DINO extraordinaire.  But then, I consider your user name and find it apt."

Ron is selling public infrastructure to a private corporation. Pure tea party.  This is what happens when you don't put down your craft beer and vote.
sanantonio,3a3402,GiganticPinkFlamingo,2,Wed Jun 17 00:57:07 2015 UTC,"SAABN is a joke, the infrastructure is archaic and already needs to be replaced. It isn't even close to complete and getting CPS to try and even finish laying the fiber was a nightmare, let alone trying to get stuff turned up. Then the budget evaporated and everyone lost interest. SAABN was a cool idea but the money is gone at it already needs to be completely rebuilt equipment wise if they want to do anything useful with it. At this point leasing out the fiber itself is probably one of the best things they could do to generate some revenue until the city can pony up the money to get it turned up correctly(which is probably to the tune of many millions of dollars)  Source: Network Engineer who worked for the city, one of the systems I was responsible for ran over the CPS fiber rings."
sanantonio,3a3402,SnoopyTRB,2,Wed Jun 17 19:23:10 2015 UTC,I got the impression from the article that it was complete. Is that not true? I'd love to hear more about the issues with SAABN since it sounds like you have hands-on experience with it.
sanantonio,3a3402,SnoopyTRB,4,Thu Jun 18 02:55:35 2015 UTC,"The impression I got from reading the article is that CPS has finally laid all the fiber, which was our biggest fight with them while I was there, that's not quite the same thing as putting in all the infrastructure. Initially,(years ago) after agreeing to run all the fiber; CPS started, then stopped and claimed they didn't have any money, and wanted us(the city) to fund it. It really was wild, we had pallets with hundreds of thousands of dollars of equipment sitting there just wasting away because the fiber wasn't getting installed in the timelines initially agreed upon, I think most of that stuff is End of Life by now and would just need to be tossed and new equipment bought.  If all the fiber is complete the biggest issue they're going to have now is equipment and staff to actually build the networks that runs over the fiber. The equipment the fiber runs on wasn't kept up very well in terms of patching and new firmware(admittedly it was tough since the public safety radio network runs on the dark fiber, try asking those guys for an outage, it was also weird in that none of us were ever really told it was ours to maintain, so the desire to jump through hoops and beat public safety into allowing an outage was basically zero, so it just sat there and ran as it was).   The other issue, staff, is tough as well. DWDM is really a niche technology and there aren't a lot of people who do it, and the people who do it well aren't cheap. That doesn't really fit the cities salary model for the IT folks.  SAABN is a really neat idea, but there are some huge hurdles to get over and a lot of money to spend to get it running as a municipally run service. That being said, because of how DWDM works they could lease bandwidth to Verizon and still run their own stuff over the same stretches of fiber, so the idea of leasing some of the bandwidth to Verizon to generate revenue is a really good idea, as long as they take that money and reinvest it into SAABN by getting equipment and paying for the right staff. Who knows if that's what they'll actually do.  Happy to answer any other city type technology question, the IT department isn't that big so I had my grubby little fingers in lots of stuff, haha."
sanantonio,3a3402,SnoopyTRB,2,Thu Jun 18 12:54:23 2015 UTC,"Sorry if my questions are pretty low-level, but I don't have the background or base knowledge about the subject that others seem to have. I'm not trying to turn this into a SnoopyTRB SAABN AMA or anything, but if you're willing to answer questions I'll be happy to ask some.    When was SAABN built? Considering the pace of technology, I would assume that keeping it up-to-date would be the hardest and most costly part of the project. If it was opened for use by citizens, how much do you think it would cost? I'm assuming it is costly?    What do we currently use it for? Is it just used to provide internet to municipal agencies or is there more to it than that? I didn't know we use it for public safety radio sot hat's kinda cool. I guess there's enough bandwidth for its current uses and Verizon? What sort of bandwidth does it provide anyway?    Thanks for taking the time to answer my questions. It seems like SAABN has been brought up a lot lately and it's very interesting to get the perspective of someone who has worked with it on a technical level."
sanantonio,3a3402,mostserene,3,Thu Jun 18 13:55:11 2015 UTC,"No worries, we can't all know everything. I like answering questions so feel free to ask away, I'll answer what I can.  I couldn't tell you when the project was launched, I do know that when I started in early 2013 the equipment that was in place was already 3-5 years old, fiber deployments typically take awhile so my guess would be the mid 2000's is when the idea of SAABN started. CPS has been running fiber for years though in order to run their own equipment. The kind of technology that SAABN runs on is usually pretty stable so the equipment that's bought could get you 5-7 years down the road pretty reliably, the problem the city faces now is that they are already 5-7 years down the road equipment wise with no revenue being generated by the system, so now what? We all know the city is broke, haha.  I wouldn't be able to answer the citizen use cost questions with anything other than speculation as I'm strictly a technical guy, I would think that in theory it shouldn't cost too much as it's an economy of scale thing, if the city can open the service up to say 10,000 people(which is a pretty small user base for our city of almost 2 million) and charge them each $50 a month for access, bam, I'm generating a half a million dollars a month in revenue to run the system and expand it. They would need to make the initial investments to get the infrastructure and staff in place to open the service up to the citizens, so that could be a struggle.  SAABN is just a service that would be run over the fiber that CPS has in the ground. Currently that fiber in the ground provides a bunch of other services, CPS runs their electric grid control and monitoring systems over it, the city runs several services over it including the radio system, the wired portion of the wireless system that runs the traffic lights, as well as a direct high speed link between the cities primary and secondary data center, most of the cities downtown facilities run off the dark fiber as well, basically everything between Municipal Courts on the West side to the Alamodome on the East side are on private fiber, referred to as COSAnet in the article. These are services that normally would cost 10's of thousands of dollars a month to get from an internet provider but the city owns it, so it's ""free"" once you exclude maintenance and the inevitable technology upgrade costs.  The short answer to the Verizon question is yes, and a lot. A little bit longer answer is that you can run 40Gbps over 1 fiber strand, so depending on how big the bundles are that CPS ran (Could be anything from 12 fiber stands to hundreds in a bundle) you could be looking at a really really large amount of bandwidth available. the cool think about dark fiber is signals can be chopped up so you could have Verizon, the city, the universities and a bunch of other stuff all running over the same 40Gbps fiber strand.  Happy to answer the questions, always nice when knowledge gained is useful to someone else."

I don't know anything about extra fees for the gym.  Pretty sure everyone has ""free"" access but if you're at all serious about working out you probably won't spend much time there anyway.    You can expect the pool to be packed on weekends anytime after noon.  Not necessarily a bad thing but it's mostly young-ish people sprawled out all over the place drinking beer.    The grounds themselves are kept clean but the complex is starting to show its age.    Never seen a car get broken into and I don't really worry about personal safety.

The closest family I have is my older brother who is a programmer in Dallas, and I can't move there because of my established business here. I'm not sure how I'd feel about a male roommate. I would have to meet you a couple times to see if I could trust you, and I also wouldn't want your wife to get upset (def double and triple check with her.

I'm definitely in need of a lifting buddy down here, as I've been out of that game far too long (I miss college!). I have a PS4/Xbone so that rounds out the video game systems pretty well! I'm not gay, but I've lived with LGBT's and have ZERO issues with it. I dunno when you're getting to town, but I'm off work around 5 most days.

sanantonio,39y4jt,holed-up,8,Mon Jun 15 19:11:31 2015 UTC,"The crime that folks complain about in San Antonio is mostly an increased rate of burglaries and petty theft. Violent crimes and sexual assault is about where you would expect for a city this size, so it's good to be cautious. I graduated from UTSA, they have a pretty decent campus police that keeps a good presence on UTSA grounds. The main campus is located in a decent area of town, but there's a few small low income areas around. As far as off campus housing it can be kinda hit or miss, it all depends on how much they invest in security and enforce their policies. Don't worry about the lack of a gate, they don't do a good job of keeping anyone out.   The smartest thing you can do is get to know your neighbors, they will help keep an eye out for you, and take standard safety precautions like you would in any city."
sanantonio,39y4jt,realmadmonkey,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:38:06 2015 UTC,"Strategically make friends with your neighbors. Don't blab away to them until you have some trust. Don't walk by them with your most valuable possessions if you don't have to. This was my exact scenario 4 years ago when I moved here after undergrad.   I used to like to check my windows were locked when I got home from work (maintenance people used to come and go as they pleased), and I used to put an old broom handle in between my sliding doors. No one could see it was down there on the ground, but it would stop the door from sliding open. It would make a startling sound if you tried to open it with the broom in there.   I genuinely feel safer with a dog. Mine is only 25 lbs, but he looks like a little killer wolf fox thing. And he's loud. People are statistically less likely to screw with someone with a dog, even if it is on the smaller side.  Pepper spray is easily attainable. You can get a gun and put it in your nightstand. You can get one from Academy in under 10 minutes if you're 21.. Try to take a class and not be a ignorant gun owner though!  These are just some things I've done! You're going to be fine! That area has some problems with theft, but that's to be expected near any college.   Be confident! If people sense fear, they're going to prey on you."

They may give a tip to their primo that a certain apartment is empty during the day and has valuables."
sanantonio,39y4jt,rockynante,7,Mon Jun 15 22:23:12 2015 UTC,"That's just silly, if you're scared they're going to tip off when she's not at home, all they have to do is sit on their porch and wait for her to leave. Most people in the apartments around UTSA aren't criminals, having a neighborly chat every now and then will go much further."
sanantonio,39y4jt,realmadmonkey,-5,Mon Jun 15 22:38:00 2015 UTC,Yea that's not a gamble you want to be on the losing end of.
sanantonio,39y4jt,rockynante,2,Mon Jun 15 23:15:59 2015 UTC,are you for real? You're much more likely to end up with a neighbor who would call the cops if they got to know you and saw someone they didn't recognize as opposed to tipping off their friends.  You must live in a really shitty part of town O_o
sanantonio,39y4jt,SnoopyTRB,3,Tue Jun 16 13:52:47 2015 UTC,"Since you are living in an apartment complex, I will tailor this specifically for that situation   Keep your car clean. Even if you remove all valuables, do not leave things that look like they may contain valuables, like bags, boxes, back packs, etc. Make sure your glove box doesn't contain a bunch of personal information minus your insurance. Park your car in as well lit of an area as you can, or an area that has high visibility Since you live on the ground floor, always make sure your blinds are closed when you go to bed\leave the apartment, and obviously lock all your doors and windows. Do not make it easy for people to peek in and see all your sweet stuff. Not only that, but it will help your electric bill just a tad by keeping it a bit cooler by preventing the sun from blaring in when you aren't home. Get to know your neighbors if you can. If your neighbors know you well enough and they notice someone else is trying to get into your apartment they will be more likely to report it if they see it, otherwise they may just assume its ""just the neighbor"". Simply knocking on their door and just introducing yourself would probably be enough, but who knows it may be an easy way to make some friends quickly. Keep your bike inside your apartment if that's feasible. I am not too familiar with bike locks but I would assume that given enough time or the right tools no bike lock is going to be enough to stop someone from stealing it. If it's a nice\expensive bike, I would consider keeping it inside your place. If its just an average bike, just make sure it's locked up around the frame and not around the tire.   There is not much else you could probably do in an apartment. Some apartments have a security system already installed but I would guess that it probably does not and I do not think you even could get one installed if you wanted to (and you shouldn't, really). Do not sweat it that it has no gated entry. My apartment has a gated entry and that hasn't stopped burglaries from happening from time to time. It's mostly just a ""feel good"" thing, but it's really easy to get into a gated community\apartment.   Other than that just common sense will do you just fine in San Antonio."
sanantonio,39y4jt,EntropicTempest,6,Mon Jun 15 21:08:45 2015 UTC,A dog would help on all fronts there if you are a dog person. Help deter would be burglars and attract friendly people. You could also get a security system installed if you are worried. Get to know your neighbors. People are generally friendly around here. Don't keep anything of value in plain sight. Get renter's insurance!
sanantonio,39y4jt,Nam-Ereh-Won,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:06:05 2015 UTC,A dog won't do you much good unless it is a trained guard dog. Most burglars are not afraid of dogs and most are really easy to pacify with just some food. This is in reference to a recent AMA by a former house burglar who said they would just put dogs in a room and shut the door.
sanantonio,39y4jt,EntropicTempest,3,Mon Jun 15 20:49:55 2015 UTC,"True, but it's a different ball game with apartments. Most often it's an opportunistic burglary, so a dog would be enough of a deterrent."
sanantonio,39y4jt,Nam-Ereh-Won,2,Mon Jun 15 21:09:18 2015 UTC,"I live at 1604 and Culebra on the NW Side a few miles down from UTSA and I think you should be fine.  I lived in an apartment on the NE side of town for a year and never had issues with people breaking into my apartment or car.    I recommend just being aware of your surroundings, keep your stuff locked, always keep a light on even when you're gone.  I also recommend trying to hunt down an alarm sticker to put on your door and windows.  Just a sticker is usually enough of a deterrent where people wont' even try to get in.  They see the sticker and try their luck elsewhere.  If you are on the first floor, I recommend going to Home Depot or Lowe's and buying one of these for your patio door: [http://www.homedepot.com/p/Master-Lock-Dual-Function-Adjustable-Door-Security-Bar-265DCCSEN/100210730?MERCH=REC-_-PIPHorizontal1_rr-_-202953665-_-100210730-_-N]  When I was in Norfolk we didn't have one and they got in through our patio door so I always recommend them now.  As someone else mentioned; if you like dogs and can afford t otake care of one properly, dogs still do deter criminals.  Just barking enough sets off a ""omg I have to get outta here"" type thinking in anyone's head.   And yeah, I'd be friendly with neighbors but I wouldn't like bring them over for drinks or what not."

sanantonio,39sydt,ResoundingGolfClap,4,Sun Jun 14 16:20:28 2015 UTC,"LA drivers can be just as bad compared to SA drivers. They just offer a different breed of baddie in terms of aggressive driving (cutting you off, speeding, etc).  The only Texas city that comes close to that similar level of shitty driving is Houston with Austin being almost as bad.  I blame the road infrastructure back in SoCal, though.   I still visit LA every couple of months and it still takes me a while to get used to it. I do miss the fact that it was rare to have every lane blocked by some slow driving ass. It tends to happen here all too often. Over there,  people want to get where they need to be quick so on the rare occasion traffic is moving it's flowing like a river but you tend to get cut off or way more than you would here.    Here though, it's usually a few drivers out of the majority driving like ass (before 12am before the drunks get behind the wheel). Usually some kid in his sports car or some idiot trying to look cool that thinks he's too important to wait in line.   I feel like I've experienced or seen significantly more road rage in Texas.  I rarely see people so royally pissed off that they want to kill you with their cars on the freeway in Cali.    It's usually a finger or kissing a bumper, but here I've seen people try to run people off the road or get out the car to fight someone on the fucking expressway. I, myself,  have experienced this a few times for the dumbest reasons.  I get people being pissed off if you cut them off, but who the hell gets out of the car when you honk at the to go at a green light when they haven't moved in 5 seconds?   Once you get used to LA driving though,  it's pretty easy to go with the flow.  Which is usually at a halt most days.  Now as far as SA is concerned,   add rain or any weather that isn't a clear dry day into the mix. Then yes,  San Antonio drivers are a fucking nightmare that makes LA drivers look like angels.  The smallest sign of rain and everyone forgets how to drive.  It amazes me how many accidents I see on my short trip to work when it drizzles, let alone pours.  It really depends on what kind of crappy driver you want to be on the road with. You want everyone speeding and cutting everyone off? Or do you want a few doing it and potentially getting out of their car with a wrench when you honk at them?  Tough choice."
sanantonio,39sydt,rileyhemp,1 point,Sun Jun 14 19:54:44 2015 UTC,I should probably clarify I'm from the bay area not LA. The only times I've been to LA theres been so much traffic I couldn't tell the good drivers from the bad.
sanantonio,39sydt,Chemical_Castration,1 point,Mon Jun 15 03:21:37 2015 UTC,"I honked at some brain dead manatee earlier today.  She felt she was well within her right to stop in the middle of the road with traffic behind her, do a 3 point turn -which took her about 5 points- blocking both lanes of traffic.  I honked, she stops and just stares at me and starts yelling dumb incoherent shit.  People like this cause the road rage, people like that who have no consideration for the lives of those around them that cause all the accidents and have the biggest of vehicles.  They acknowledge they're so terrible they need the largest vehicle possible to feel safe for when they smash into someone, yet they don't bother to put the phone down or learn how to navigate a simple road system."

Yes, we are mostly nice to our people, unless we shoot them for drinking the last beer after the beer store closes, and usually polite to strangers as we pass by - but it's fake as fuck.

Why is it expected and perfectly OK for KZEP to play the same 100 songs from 1965-1985, but not for KISS to play the same 100 songs from 1980-2005?  Rock has been around in the modern sense for about 50-60 years. KISS is a classic rock station, it just specializes in a different era than KZEP or a traditional classic rock station does.  If you don't like it, don't listen to it. Terrestrial music radio is a dying medium, and its companies are trying just about anything they can to appeal to as wide an audience as possible. That's why you get lowest common denominator shit like Billy Madison in the morning.  The problem is that KISS is not going to attract younger audiences, because they've mostly grown up with the internet, and internet/satellite radio. Their music tastes are far too varied to fit into the traditional FM radio format.  So they're stuck trying to hold on to people my age, who basically only listen to the radio at work or in the car. We are used to hearing RHCP, Metallica and Staind, so that's what they're going to play.  Lay off. We're old. Trapt and Linkin Park are apparently comforting to us. We have very old, very fond memories that have the same 2 Sublime songs playing in the background.  And get off my dang lawn."
sanantonio,39rrcn,OldArmyMetal,3,Sun Jun 14 13:29:34 2015 UTC,"KISS is a classic rock station   And that's fine, but the thing is, they bill themselves as an Active Rock station, which implies that they should be playing more new music as opposed to 20-year-old STP and Nirvana songs. I remember a couple of years ago, we were driving back into San Antonio from Houston, and we had the radio on the station. The deejay was talking about the reunited Soundgarden and mentioned the band's new album King Animal...  ...right before he launched into ""Black Hole Sun."" I mean, really?"

I listened to a lot of Brock and Salk and Ron & Don as well. I still listen to Luke Burbank on the TBTL podcast every day.  Seattle radio is great. But that's probably because people still listen to it, because Seattle has a music scene.  In the 70s and 80s, when San Antonio was a metal/hard rock town, the radio was a lot better. Now it's a desolate audio hellscape, dominated by iheartradio and pop music. No one wants to play here, even though it's the 7th largest city in the nation.

sanantonio,39qa5a,elfuegodemuerte,6,Sat Jun 13 20:19:55 2015 UTC,I think the new tracks are to accommodate the freight trains that are going through there on those tracks currently and move more freight to the East of IH-35.  edit: Source and changed some words.

As with any major endeavor, it would cost billions in funding but it would also provide growth, new opportunities and an influx of money into the area.

sanantonio,39qa5a,BKGPrints,2,Sat Jun 13 23:02:30 2015 UTC,"Since state funding is required, this is really the only option to get this intercity rail project built at all, given the current political climate.

Agreed, but I was talking more immediate ""bang for the buck"". There's no doubt that a congestion-proof, reliable, fast way to get between the downtowns could induce some different travel patterns. It would be possible, for example, for someone to live in San Antonio and work in Austin. That's not a drive many people want to do now, but if they had the LSTAR, it would open up the possibility of living further away from where you work.   The main attraction would be able to expand past San Antonio or Austin. Connections to Dallas, Houston, Corpus Christi, etc.   Yeah, those plans are also in the works, working with the LSRD project.   When I'm talking about HSR, I'm not necessarily talking about Maglev, which have high speeds of 300+ mph but the type of rail that can go between 120-150 mph, where conventional rail is half of that.   I'm not talking about Maglev either. HSR, to me, is in the 160+ MPH range. ""Conventional"" rail can actually run at relatively high speeds, and does in many parts of the country.

HSR would require its own dedicated line, and would do nothing to move the 30+ freight trains per day out of downtowns like San Marcos.   Yes...I know it would and that's not necessarily a bad thing if there's a rail line dedicated to moving people and not freight.     Re-using the existing UPRR line (the alignment of which will support speeds of up to 110 mph with minor modifications and upgraded infrastructure) makes a whole lot more sense.   Would it really be able to get speeds up to 110 mph?  I don't know much about the UPRR line but if those claims are true, I would support that as an alternative.  The main factor for the rail needs to be the benefits it offers and one of those is a faster commute time."

There can be more than one train that operates on different schedules and different routes to reduce the stopping and speed up the travel time.   That's basically the LSTAR operating plan - express trains with a top speed of 80-90 MPH connecting the two major city downtowns, plus local and skip-stop trains making many more stops (for commuters). The Maglev HSR comment is irrelevant. Any kind of HSR, including the typical French or Japanese 220 MPH type, does not stop every 3 to 5 miles. It would no longer be ""HS"".   Would it really be able to get speeds up to 110 mph? I don't know much about the UPRR line but if those claims are true, I would support that as an alternative.   The alignment, with some curve remediation and improved tracks, could definitely support operations at 110 MPH.

sanantonio,39qa5a,HLAW8S,3,Sun Jun 14 03:57:19 2015 UTC,"The toll road is nice sometimes but it is a bit far east and you end up driving more miles than if you were just on IH-35. There is also the cost of the toll road in addition to the cost of a car. Overall, rail would be much cheaper for a person who is merely looking to travel between the two cities.   We should also not forget that this will incorporate other cities like New Braunfels, San Marcos, Kyle, Buda, Round Rock, and Georgetown. Those cities also stand to benefit from the rail line and they do not all have easy/quick access to the toll road.  It's a shame that Ivy Taylor won the election tonight.

I would also imagine that, once implemented, faster trains and route improvements could be added over the years so this is a good starting point.  Plus at only $15-$20 Million a year (a cost that would probably be split between the servicing cities) this is a bargain. Compare this to the IH35 improvements in the Austin area alone which are estimated to be around $4.2 Billion! Other costs in our area such as IH-10 ($44M), Wurzbach Parkway ($146M), Fred/Medical Dr ($14.6M) pale in comparison."

Total projected travel time downtown to downtown is actually more in the 1 hour 15 minute range. I drive that route a lot for my job, and I have yet to do it in even close to that time during peak period commuting hours.  By the way, this isn't a VIA project.

But then again, roads require public subsidy as well. Even some toll roads - i.e. SH130. All forms of transportation at one time or another require public subsidy - airports, sea ports, the ATC system, etc., etc.  The last round of ridership modeling showed that between 5 million and 6 million trips would be taken on LSTAR."

sanantonio,39qa5a,TXJKU,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:38:51 2015 UTC,"It would be different because it would offer a real, viable, faster, more reliable trip than driving on I-35, whereas SH 130 is located way too far east to be of use to anyone except people wanting to bypass Austin and San Antonio. The LSTAR would actually serve the population centers, not wind through the countryside like SH 130.  If you have some data to show that ""nobody is going to ride that train"", I'd love to see it. Any study I've seen shows a lot of demand."
sanantonio,39qa5a,jb9152,-1,Tue Jun 16 01:45:39 2015 UTC,"Lots of data was used to promote SH 130, I see on their website they have used the same studies - from 2008, that includes the highway   http://lonestarrail.com/images/uploads/SH_130_Corridor.Fatal_Flaw_Analysis_Report_.090209_.pdf  You think that's good data?   Nobody's going to ride the train to Austin - when you get on the train, I'll be on 35 laughing at you as you go through TSA scanners and wait in long lines to board the 75 minute ride...."
sanantonio,39qa5a,TXJKU,2,Tue Jun 16 02:00:53 2015 UTC,"That study was to determine whether or not SH 130 could be used for a rail corridor. The study found that the answer was ""no"". You would have known that had you actually, you know, read some of the report. But, mad copy and paste skills!  There is no TSA inspection requirement to ride passenger rail anywhere in the country. The ride is only 75 minutes if you're going from San Antonio to Austin. It's shorter if you're riding a shorter distance (as would be most of the commuting public). For example, the trip from Georgetown to downtown Austin would be about 30 minutes. Same for San Marcos to downtown Austin. Faster than you can drive it."

sanantonio,39pp9a,flyboy10029,15,Sat Jun 13 15:27:53 2015 UTC,"Can't say I've ever ran with them, but this is the biggest running group I know of  We used to play volley ball with San Antonio Sports and Social club for a few years and met some cool folks there. Almost guaranteed a few drinks after each game to catch up.   Not sure if cycling is your thing, but I have actually been on a few group rides with the Wheelmen. There are a ton of group rides that happen in SA all over the place.  Even if you want to just check the local parks, there are always organized hikes and what not to tag along with. McAlister park is 281/1604 area. OP Schnabel is Bandera/1604. Government canyon is huge and organized out 1604/culebra. The city recently redid the mission reach trails to look great (you can kayak there too!). Salado Creek is Blanco/wurzbach pkwy area. Eisenhower park is north of 1604 on military. Freiderich park is north of 1604/10. Obviously I know the northside better, but there are some that I don't know the name of in the stone oak area.   As for food, I don't know groups there. The pearl and southtown features some of the trendier foods (and folks) and I imagine there are groups that try some of the new ones. Try maybe some of the coffee shops that have big community boards? Local coffee in Alamo heights probably attracts the biggest group. Halycon is smack dab in the middle too.   Beer and outdoors tends to go hand in hand. Check out some of the walls of the local pubs for organized things to do. Big hops is a local growler station. GS 1221 too, and is in the hipster heart of SA. Freetail is local brewery, as is Alamo beer. Smaller operations include blue star and busted sandal. Ranger creek is a bit out of town but still local.   Last thing that comes to mind is first friday. Pub runs, group rides, art shows... tons of folks come to the areas mentioned to just hang out. Happens on the first friday of the month. Well known, but kind of hush hush online. Which is funny. I'd start at blue star and just see where it takes you.   Welcome to SA!"

Do you have your own vehicle, though, because teaching someone to drive stick (depending on how fast they learn) can be really hard on your clutch and transmission.

sanantonio,39i7ry,BriefBeardKitty,6,Thu Jun 11 22:31:15 2015 UTC,Yes - exactly - the Austin network aka GAATN was a catalyst to become allow Google Fiber to tier and also enabled  the ATT Giga Power offering to leverage the GAATN capacity.  A SAABN network could be a game changer here.
sanantonio,39i7ry,kamnakaze,5,Thu Jun 11 22:36:24 2015 UTC,"So I'm reading about this, and from what I gather the SAABN is already pre-installed. What are the roadblocks for getting this network up and running?"
sanantonio,39i7ry,sfoxy,6,Thu Jun 11 22:15:13 2015 UTC,SAABN needs a regulatory body - one that can identify participating entities and create an equitable cost model.    SAABN needs a person or two whose single purpose is to wake up every single morning figuring out how to manage the participants and the network.
sanantonio,39i7ry,stayputsocks,3,Thu Jun 11 22:26:10 2015 UTC,What kind of requirements and experience would such a person possess?
sanantonio,39i7ry,ChupaMeJerkwad,3,Thu Jun 11 23:40:32 2015 UTC,In an ideal world - someone with policy/legal experience and technical experience- I look at GAATN's board presidents as a way to define candidate requirements ..
sanantonio,39i7ry,excoriator,5,Fri Jun 12 02:06:41 2015 UTC,I'm very surprised San Antonio hasn't already turned on SAABN. Does municipal broadband have the potential to provide high speed Internet to more than just municipal entities?
sanantonio,39i7ry,excoriator,7,Thu Jun 11 22:17:49 2015 UTC,"In Texas we are regulatory challenged to offer muni broadband to homes and businesses.   The State PUC code makes it a hard haul for a municipality to offer internet to its private citizens.  BUT BUT BUT - a municipality could offer high speed broadband to any participating governmental entity - one thing that could be possible is to create a network of gov entities to share the costs of high speed access.   Its a possible solution for high capacity access for courts, universities, schools, hospitals, clinics.  Moreover, the FCC is making challenges to some states that have passed restrictive legislation like Tennessee and North Carolina - in both states established muni broadband has been restricted from expanding due to state legislation.   If the FCC were to prevail it could set the stage for the broadband as a utility in Texas."

sanantonio,39i7ry,captshady,1 point,Fri Jun 12 13:01:48 2015 UTC,You mention relief via the FCC. The FCC has commissioners appointed by Republicans and Dems. To what extent is regulation of municipal broadband a partisan issue? My understanding is that the broadband industry contributes to campaigns of members of Congress from both parties and that is the root cause of the inertia on deregulation.
sanantonio,39i7ry,SmoothRiverOtter,3,Fri Jun 12 02:35:22 2015 UTC,"Muni broadband is an issue about information as infrastructure. You could reduce the issues to partisan soundbites, but I hope we can have an exchange more nuanced than that.  And while I love the idea of muni broadband in SATX, the best we can do now is to progress in steps and step one is to create a network for the institutions that serve the folks that live here."
sanantonio,39i7ry,BriefBeardKitty,2,Fri Jun 12 03:33:51 2015 UTC,"I wasn't looking to start a partisan battle. I just wanted to get your insider perspective on whether partisanship is contributing to the lack of interest by legislative bodies (at levels above municipal) on making municipal broadband useful by the people. Convincing the 10 members of San Antonio's city council to do something is a cakewalk compared to convincing the state lege to do something, especially if the deck is stacked against it by campaign contributions."
sanantonio,39i7ry,Keith_Toney,2,Fri Jun 12 19:32:17 2015 UTC,We don't need the state leg to do anything right now.  The legal framework from step one of SAABN already exists.  If we mirror the GAATN model we can comply with state and federal law.

sanantonio,39i7ry,sfoxy,3,Fri Jun 12 13:56:51 2015 UTC,"That's a great question!  Do you know about the digital divide - the fact that communities like San Antonio are the most likely to have the highest percentage of people without internet in the home and at the same time likely to pay the most for a subscription in the home.  In effect, San Antonio has a digital divide problem.   Some macro level high level statistics back me up - 47 percent for households with income below $25,000; 64 percent for African Americans and 53 percent for Hispanics; 63 percent for people with disabilities; 51 percent for people with limited English proficiency; 38 percent for households that prefer Spanish.  In a community with a digital divide problem  We are challenged with creating a work force that is digitally literate -  we are challenged to reach people for health care and employment options. We are challenged to be economically competitive and to ensure that our city grows with equal infrastructure for all  (preferred neighborhoods are those with streets / power/ water service / and now high capacity access)"

Some apartments have a gate but leave it open 24/7. The highest rent places are going to be the ones near the UTSA campus as they aim to cater to students but they're also some of the nicer ones in the area.   That being said, in the 5 years that I've lived here I've noticed that San Antonio as a whole is a large span of ""average"" to ""good"" areas with pockets of ""very nice"" and ""not as nice"" spaced throughout with the ""not as nice"" being clustered on the south part of town."

By the time I got Scuba certified, the lake was already too low for me to feel comfortable, so I dunno if it's still there.  That said, plenty of places there which could make diving pretty sketchy I'd say. If it's like Canyon, parts of the lake will be deep enough to where you can't see without the aid of lights as well (deeper than I'd want to go in any lake for sure)."

sanantonio,39bn2f,m00dawg,2,Thu Jun 11 00:47:37 2015 UTC,"I heard the contract was being changed, though I haven't found any official sources for that so it may have been wishful thinking down the grapevine. I recall when SAWS started pumping from the lake, and the subsequent drop was rapid and obvious.  SAWS has to get water from somewhere obviously but I don't think the rapid depletion of the lake ended up being good for SAWS, the farmers, or the residents of Medina lake. So hopefully whatever they may be coming up with is a bit more reasonable."

So now they can provide cable and/or video service to this municipality?  Does that include internet?  Because apparently SICFAs are specific to cable/video services.

Taquería Datapoint - nice sit down diner feel, friendly service, pretty damn good breakfast tacos, and selection.  Taco n Salsa - The trash can taco is killer, service is on the slower side also maybe friendly or it make you feel like an inconvenience for being there(to be fair they do some volume for a small place), the place is kinda small so go during an off hour if possible.  Again though the Trash Can taco is amazing.  Taco House - Is my favorite I've found yet.  Its an older building looks like an old fish camp.  Cash only, counter service, MASSIVE board menu, and pretty dang friendly.  The second time I went back was probably 4-5 days after my first time.  I asked the younger guy working the window what I had last time by description and he (I bullshit you not) said ""oh yeah I remember you got the chorizo and egg and the carne guisada tacos"".  I was amazed he remembered!!!  Honorable mention:  I haven't had the tacos here, but before we moved I was driving around and found Titos Breakfast.  It was my first real experience with a ""Latin style breakfast"" (sorry if that's not the right way to word it).

Rolandos is decent, you can get a super taco which is ridiculously huge. Guajillo's had some decent al pastor tacos. Los Robertos taco shop is also pretty tasty and they offer a wide variety of salsas. Taqueria Aguas Calientes also has some delicious breakfast tacos. Also, for some reason, I really love Bill Miller's carne guisada tacos with cheese.   This is by no means an authoritative list (though I think it's pretty solid) and a lot of people have a lot of opinions on what constitutes a good taco shop. I could be way off base too.

The dog was sitting in it's yard possibly barking at a stranger. Why wouldn't it do that? Just like you can't shoot at a car for no reason like the LAPD did you can't shoot at a dog that isn't actively attacking you. Doesn't matter what situation.

sanantonio,396jml,BKGPrints,3,Tue Jun 9 19:24:17 2015 UTC,"The problem with HEB for me is that the idea of ""variety"" they sell is being able to choose between 15 different types of grape jelly. Always the same item, but made by different companies.  Wal-Mart always seems to have expired goods on the shelves. I don't always look at every item I buy from there when I am in a hurry. I have had chips I bought in April which expired in November 2014 and today I ate a yogurt I bought on Saturday that had expired on May 26 2015. Just saying, we could use an actual grocery chain to compete with HEB that has freshness checked as I expect a store to do. There is always a 16th manufacturer of grape jelly."

sanantonio,393v74,DariusBieber,2,Tue Jun 9 02:42:28 2015 UTC,"San Antonio's airport really is years behind.   Not really. There was a plan to start a third terminal as soon as the replacement for Terminal B was finished at the end of the last decade, but that got shelved because the industry was hurting and no airlines wanted the new gates. We should be glad that they're not building more airport than we need, because overbuilding is risky. Just ask places like Cincinnati and St. Louis, where the airports were overbuilt for airlines that don't have major hub operations in those cities anymore."
sanantonio,393v74,excoriator,8,Tue Jun 9 02:51:30 2015 UTC,"In a sense it actually is. The reason Cincinatti and St. Louis ""overbuilt"" is because they were former hubs. American Airlines and Pan Am used to serve hundreds of destinations from St Louis and the airport needed to be big. It feels like they have overbuilt now because American has pulled out of St. Louis a few years ago. Same with Cincinatti. It used to be a hub for United Airlines, but they also pulled out.    I don't want SAT to build more terminals. I want them to build more destinations and have more communication with airlines. No need to worry about oversizing SAT, San Antonio will never be a hub anyways.  San Antonio is years behind, absolutely no doubt. Austin has a much lower population but has more destinations than San Anronio AND a European desintarion. Just about 8 years ago, San Antonio had more destinations than Austin did... Which included a small hub for United."

Hated having to cadge for tips and violate company rules to make the tour interesting and earn decent tips. Hated having to report in on Christmas Day (especially since there were few if any passengers). Hated having to be out in bad weather. Hated having to do dinner cruises where the waiters and restaurants made boatloads of money but usually stiffed us. Hated mean spirited rules (such as captains cannot be seen eating lunch or sitting down) Loved winning the contest to suggest a name to replace ""Yanaguana"" Interesting to hear how the previous owner really did shred incriminating documents when the city started investigating.

Me personally, San Antonio has become more heavily touristy with the influx of people moving from CA to TX because they want to get a grasp on what TX is like by visiting just San Antonio. Word of mouth is a powerful thing. But I do agree that during ""Fiesta"" the area gets pretty bad. Not cringe-worthy bad mind you, but just the way things are done just make me shake my head. And don't even get me started on when NIOSA rolls around. All that fail."

I do it with my fountain drinks; about half soda, and then the rest with the carbonated water. It tastes good and without the funky bitter taste of the artificial sweeteners."
sanantonio,38x33v,jondrethegiant,1 point,Mon Jun 8 02:07:53 2015 UTC,Full soda with less sugar would be a lot more bitter than half soda with half carbonated water.

When I was deployed to Baghdad we would get the luxury of visiting all sorts of FOBs and their mess halls, this was a privilege because our mess hall sucked and we had to eat MRE most of the time. Well some of these mess halls had all the variety of coke and Pepsi products but they were made in the middle east. I tried all different types of sodas but they all tasted off or weird. Well I was not a diet soda drinker at all but one of the last sodas I tried was diet coke and low and behold it tasted the exact same as the US counterpart. Ever since that day I have been hooked on diet coke while I was deployed it helped me feel at home so I think I grew attached to the normalcy that it gave me."

Just because a few of you like to sit and play a board game for 4 hours doesn't make it a good time.  You should have it at a place that has entertainment... Maybe a pool? The river?

They've really done a lot to the park, and we still make the drive over there in the summer. I absolutely love the houses there and would love to move back, but my bf prefers newer houses, so that's out. But overall I love that area.

sanantonio,38tu3j,MandaPandaTX,3,Sat Jun 6 20:07:04 2015 UTC,"It really depends where. I live about 5 blocks away from the lake, so I'm closer to Wilson. The surrounding streets are pretty quiet. You do get the occasional booming bass driving by but for the most part it's been a good spot. We did have a bike get stolen from the garage, otherwise no other crime issues. The Jehovah's witnesses will knock on your door, along with the occasional randos wanting to do your yard work for cheap. I will say that the closer you get to Zarzamora it gets a little dicey, which was confirmed by some LE friends. Pretty much everything immediately south of the lake and to the west is pretty cool. Oh, there are some gnarly potholes throughout.  Tl;dr nice hood depending on where you are"

I think it's like 60 bucks or so but it's one time and then you just go, pay a few bucks for shop fees for any other time you go. They have balance/rotation for life too. I think together they're like 100 bucks, give or take.  I found the site. I've done this to every car I've owned for quite a few years and never had any trouble http://brakecheck.com/alignment.html"

Edit: my dad told the ice cream man how he remembered his ice cream man used to blast smoke on the water or GFR. He thought that was funny so next time around he played a little smoke on the water for my dad. I miss that guy, the paper did a story on him because he was delivering to all of San Antonio and would do a different neighborhood every day."
sanantonio,38r3uv,sfoxy,2,Sat Jun 6 08:52:44 2015 UTC,The one in my area plays this. I don't tend to get upset about much of anything but that sound could turn me into the Hulk.

The one here on the NE side doesn't--and he doesn't come around late at night, or at all in the cold winter months, but when we lived off Hackberry and when we lived off Lockhill Selma, the ones that came around there not only had Christmas music in rotation (usually ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"") but also did the late night and freezing cold thing.  I'm pretty sure they weren't just selling ice cream."
sanantonio,38r3uv,Grave_Girl,3,Sat Jun 6 04:51:35 2015 UTC,You guys have an ice cream truck? :-(

I imagine the chances of losing control of the chair and running it into traffic are increased when you are operating a chair in an awkward, unintended fashion...

sanantonio,38owde,FrostMute,7,Fri Jun 5 23:01:10 2015 UTC,The joysticks that power chairs are controlled with are very sensitive and janky... Flick your wrist the wrong way and the chair shoots off in an unintended direction.   Riding one down the street LAYING on the chair is not putting you in a position to be controlling the joystick accurately.  And then you careen off the sidewalk and into a bus.
sanantonio,38owde,TacoKingBean,5,Fri Jun 5 18:08:22 2015 UTC,Because common sense
sanantonio,38svca,autumn_catt,15,Sat Jun 6 15:04:50 2015 UTC,That is bullshit. Rent is paid when it's received by the landlord. Doesn't matter what the date is on the money order.
sanantonio,38svca,fiddlechick,7,Sat Jun 6 17:15:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah,  I'm not seeing the logic here. If that were the case I'd turn in a money order a month late and show them the date."
sanantonio,38svca,ResoundingGolfClap,12,Sat Jun 6 17:37:56 2015 UTC,You should read your lease. All the information you need is in there; especially when and how to pay the rent.
sanantonio,38svca,san_toaster,4,Sat Jun 6 15:38:30 2015 UTC,I've never heard that. I think the rule is that if the mail has a time stamp but arrives late then the payment is still valid.   Or something. Idk
sanantonio,38svca,sniffing_accountant,3,Sat Jun 6 15:57:48 2015 UTC,"Rent is ""paid"" when the landlord has it in his/her hand. When the tenant incurred the cost really has nothing to do with when the rent is paid.   Think of it in reverse. If what you're staying is correct, people who pay their rent via check would not ""pay"" their rent till the check clears their bank...when they actually incur the cost. Because checks take a few days to clear, that would leave a whole lot of people who pay their rent on time with past due rent.   I see is as any other bill, really. A bill is considered paid when the payee receives it, not when the payor incurs the cost."
