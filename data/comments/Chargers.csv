Chargers,3e3ew7,ataleoftwobrews,10,Tue Jul 21 17:32:34 2015 UTC,The big difference is the corporate money and that is what Spanos is looking at when it comes to SD vs LA.
Chargers,3e3ew7,Bolt2006,4,Tue Jul 21 18:17:45 2015 UTC,"I think you are right about that, but Spanos is also being very short-sighted.  Corporate sponsorship dollars will probably be easy to get at first, just based on the novelty of having a team after a 20 year absence.  But those dollars won't keep flowing endlessly if no one wants the product.  For a team like the Chargers with no real affiliation in L.A., they would have to win big and regularly to keep people coming to games.  If people stop coming to games, those corporate sponsors won't have much incentive to keep spending their dollars with the Chargers."
Chargers,3e3ew7,fuckdirectv,2,Tue Jul 21 19:11:43 2015 UTC,"Being a Chargers fan in LA, I'm still indifferent about any team moving here (even if it's the Chargers). LA doesn't need a football team. We got 2 teams in NBA, MLB, and NHL (those Anaheim teams are basically in the LA Market). Even the LA Galaxy is pretty strong in support these days.  It'd be nice if the Chargers is closer to me, but I don't want San Diego to lose their team for my convenience since your city needs the Chargers more than LA needs a team."

Chargers,3e3ew7,tubetop2go,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:53:23 2015 UTC,"Of course there's currently apathy in Los Angeles. Why would anybody get excited about a potential team when your city has been used repeatedly for the past 20 years by the NFL to squeeze money out of other cities? Whenever the topic pops up in /r/losangeles you get tons of people who say ""yeah, not happening"" regardless of how much evidence you present. This, however, doesn't mean it will stay that way. The city will only get excited when they know for sure that it's actually happening."

What really blew my mind is how few people went to Rams games in their final years playing in Anaheim. 26,000 people at an NFL game?? Wow."

Too late for that.  2) People could just not show up to the games even though tickets were bought, but that money is still in the team's pockets. Even though it would look awesome that nobody showed up to the games, it would be spun by the announcers, and everyone else, that SD doesn't deserve to keep the Chargers because they aren't supporting their team (despite how shitty the situation has been thus far).  Even though we want to stick it to the owners, the best course is to show them that SD still likes the Chargers by supporting them. Then, if they do move to LA, don't follow them there. Let them struggle to find a fanbase in LA...because I've heard that 25% of ticket sales comes from ticket brokers. That's not really a fanbase. And out of all the NFL teams the Chargers resonate about the same as the Jags do in LA. Basically nobody there cares. So make them regret their decision and laugh afterwards when they fail miserably. That's not the outcome people want...because it means they end up leaving. But not much else can be done."

Chargers,3dzu22,og_sandiego,5,Mon Jul 20 21:33:24 2015 UTC,"San Diego City Attorney Jan Goldsmith has had legendary faceoffs with some of the region’s more cantankerous political figures: his predecessor Michael Aguirre, former Mayor Bob Filner, attorney Cory Briggs.  Add Chargers special counsel Mark Fabiani to the list.  Fabiani’s aggressive advocacy for a Chargers’ move to Los Angeles and his slashing denunciations of San Diego’s efforts to keep them here certainly has made the stadium derby entertaining. He’s made legitimate points, but his attacks on Mayor Kevin Faulconer’s leadership and competence has ratcheted up the tension.  Fabiani’s more recent broadsides have been aimed at what he calls “the city’s misbegotten legal strategy.” He says San Diego’s recently adopted plan to fast-track an environmental review for a December or January election can’t be done properly and doesn’t have a legal leg to stand on.  To Goldsmith, them's fightin' words.  The city attorney responded publicly in his methodical fashion, laying out his case for why what Fabiani says isn’t so. Along the way, he took out a verbal blow torch, deriding Fabiani as a “mouthpiece” only interested in undermining San Diego’s efforts. He also questioned whether Fabiani had the chops to even discuss the matter at hand.  “Mark Fabiani wouldn’t known an Environmental Impact Report if he stumbled over it,” Goldsmith told Darren Smith on The Mighty 1090 on Wednesday.  It didn’t use to be this way. In March, when the city and county announced funding to pay for outside hired guns to help them negotiate a stadium deal with the Chargers, Fabiani was conspicuous in his praise of Goldsmith’s involvement — when he had little good to say about anybody else on that side of the table.  Then Goldsmith raised some eyebrows when it was learned that he had private conversations with the Chargers about getting negotiations going before the mayor’s stadium task force was done with its work.  That seems long ago. Goldsmith is a staunch defender of the EIR plan pushed by Faulconer. Not only is it on solid legal ground and paves the way for a stadium vote, Goldsmith said, but it shows the NFL San Diego is making progress in its effort. And he relished the notion that it might upend Fabiani’s strategy to portray San Diego as dysfunctional on the stadium front.  “It’s his worst nightmare that we have our act together,” he told Smith.  Who’s on first?  A growing number of people don’t think the Chargers are going to stick around here much longer.  Among the most adamant for some time has been Scott Lewis, editor-in-chief of the Voice of San Diego, who on Twitter Wednesday said “I was first to say Chargers were done with San Diego.”  I haven’t been keeping score, but I’m glad to credit Scott with I-told-you-so bragging rights — at least in this latest episode of the Chargers-L.A. soap opera.  It seems ancient history but in 2002 then-L.A. Times columnist T.J. Simers made his prediction: “The Chargers will leave San Diego, move into their Carson training camp facility, which they are already contracted to begin using this summer, and will kick off the 2004 season here — in a temporary site such as the Coliseum.”  You ask me, the statute of limitations has run out on that one. Simers went on to predict the Chargers' exit on and off for much of the next decade. It reminded me of a doom-and-gloom business writer who a colleague once said had predicted seven of the last three recessions.  In any event, Scott might want keep it vague about exactly when the Chargers will leave."

He's probably delaying to see if the Chargers get confirmation for the move to LA. If they do, he'll likely retire just to keep his family in SD.

Chargers,3drahh,tnt6656,3,Sun Jul 19 01:32:29 2015 UTC,are you sure this is a Madden 16 breakdown? you mentioned something about Donald Butler being an impact player? I got confused and thought we were living in 2011.
Chargers,3drahh,MikeMcNorv,2,Sat Jul 18 19:35:09 2015 UTC,"He can still be an impact player, the talent is there hopefully he just had a down year and plays better this season. Give him a chance."
Chargers,3drahh,crustycupcakes,2,Sun Jul 19 15:27:03 2015 UTC,he had back-to-back down years.
Chargers,3drahh,MikeMcNorv,3,Sun Jul 19 18:31:02 2015 UTC,He can get better! I believe! He's just been in a funk. I'm overly optimistic this year.
Chargers,3drz1c,wbrody15,9,Sat Jul 18 21:56:43 2015 UTC,Although Weddle is amazing he is also aging. A huge contract for a 30+ year old safety is risky. I think the Chargers will franchise tag him next season. Weddle won't be happy but he's not the type to miss mandatory practices. I don't see him remaining with the team after next season though.
Chargers,3drz1c,zeehrob,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:50:38 2015 UTC,Hit the nail on the head. Franchise tagging him would be the best thing possible or agreeing to a contract that makes sense for both him and the team.
Chargers,3drz1c,azatarain,4,Sun Jul 19 00:40:50 2015 UTC,"I heard the Chargers aren't interested in extending his contract, but his beard is rumoured to take up the rest of our capspace with its upcoming deal."

Chargers,3drz1c,BoltingUpSince91,2,Sun Jul 19 00:53:36 2015 UTC,"They've said many times that they plan to have rivers as the qb for the future. It's just whether or not they can agree on a contract, and if we move to LA then there's a better chance he won't re sign"

Chargers,3dom5c,BobTaco,5,Sat Jul 18 00:00:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think Dean would only entertain offers now if they were for the team's LA worth."
Chargers,3dom5c,BehindACorpFireWall,13,Sat Jul 18 00:08:40 2015 UTC,"This is a bad letter. Dean doesn't want to sell the team.

He would need at least a billion in liquid assets to even begin to put out an offer that Spanos would listen to.

Chargers,3djcnk,needmoretape,4,Thu Jul 16 20:56:22 2015 UTC,"I plan on having a mini celebration when the city makes the EIR despite what Fabiani has said . He keeps mentioning how it's illegal , using the taxpayer money , and if it did work why didn't farmers field do the same thing ?    It's an existing stadium site . The city has a team of people to do the EIR ,  more employees than a private enterprise could put together . We have an expert on EIR who's said not only do we probably not even need one , but that it's very feasible to accomplish it in the timeframe we have .  It's not technically using taxpayer money it's using a special allotment of funds from the federal government . An EIR would need to be done regardless . Qualcomm costs the city a lot of money . If the Chargers leave, the city would do an EIR  to build a more economical facility anyway.  Farmers Field did not do an EIR on an existing site . That takes considerable more time.    It's going to feel so good to see that smug face lose . He keeps saying we wasted six months with the stadium advisory committee . Well what was the alternative Fabiani ? The mayor will close his eyes and pick a site on the map with no research ? The Chargers wanted downtown badly , ok than make that clear with the city from day one. Start the negotiations and go from there ."
Chargers,3djcnk,If_its_mean_downvote,3,Thu Jul 16 21:06:14 2015 UTC,"Yes for the most part. The only thing the city has to worry about with the EIR now that they removed thethe surrounding development plan, is any new environmental laws that have gone into place since the last EIR on the site was completed. The stadium is smaller, and holds less people, so traffic, noise, etc will be the same as the Q now."
Chargers,3djcnk,BobTaco,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:53:59 2015 UTC,"using the taxpayer money   Its said like its a bad thing to use tax payer money, despite that kind of being the whole point of the Chargers getting a stadium.

Chargers,3djcnk,HeavensentLXXI,3,Thu Jul 16 21:51:11 2015 UTC,"I hate most things on BFTB, but this is the best breakdown I've seen on this issue. I have thought the timeline Fabiani kept spewing out made no sense. I kept wondering how all these ballot initiatives that ""SD can't do because it takes too long"" was done in like 4 months...but it will take SD 8-12 months to do the same thing? I also wondered how all the negotiations being done in Carson was done so fast. I wondered why, when the Rams owner bought the land and everyone and their mother speculated that a stadium was going there, the Chargers didn't see that as a threat. They did. Good to know.   Glad to know I wasn't the only one wondering this crap, and I'm glad my version of the timeline was more or less how it went down. The Mayor isn't innocent in this thing either though. Both sides are talking from both sides of their mouths. But it is now super obvious that Fabiani lied to the Mayor's face saying they had time to wait on this issue. Tried to pull a fast one expecting everyone to be sleeping."
Chargers,3djcnk,BobTaco,-5,Thu Jul 16 21:48:41 2015 UTC,"His job is to give the Chargers the best option for LA if SD can't get a stadium done.  I don't understand why you all get your panties in a wad about Fabiani this and that.    The fact is San Diego brings very little to the table.  The stadium sucks.  The fanbase barely shows up for games.  The city government has dicked around for 15 years and can't pull their head out of their ass.  If they go to LA, they will gain huge market share of all of southern California.  They do not give a shit about the few folks who have declared they won't be Chargers fan's if they leave.  They already have shit support so what is there to lose.  Most of the people who say they won't support the Chargers if they move, probably don't support them already or will change their minds.  That said I hope they can get a stadium done in SD.  Trying to flame Fabiani or Spanos for doing what is in the best interest of their organization is only going to drive them to LA.    If you want them to stay, try pushing the city government to get shit done."

Chargers,3djzwz,abe_manny,8,Thu Jul 16 21:58:24 2015 UTC,"It all boils down to injuries. Chargers have all the pieces to make a good run. Lately, the injury bug has been brutal. Last season was the worst I've seen.  I feel bad for you though...because it's looking like the Chargers owners are going to pack and run off. I hope this season is good though...for everyone's sake."
Chargers,3djzwz,BobTaco,2,Fri Jul 17 00:00:00 2015 UTC,What was the deal with the injuries this past year? I had no idea injuries plagued this team. and yeah it's a bummer but i have faith they'll stay!
Chargers,3djzwz,Nmilne23,7,Fri Jul 17 01:27:52 2015 UTC,"We went through 5 starting centers. I am not exaggerating to you when I say nearly half the team missed some sort of time with injuries. Almost everyone on defense got injured at some point. We lost server all key players for most of the season (Hardwick, woodhead)  We were 5-1 and basically tied with Dallas for being the best team in the league, and injuries completely fucking fucked our tiny assholes. We coulda been dominant last year"
Chargers,3djzwz,toekneebalogna,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:49:41 2015 UTC,yikes. Well i guess the good news is that ya'll are goin in with a healthy team. I'm excited to watch!
Chargers,3djzwz,TheFakeTomTelesco,5,Fri Jul 17 01:52:15 2015 UTC,"He's really not wrong, too.  2 years ago, we were around 5th most games lost due to injuries according to footballoutsiders.com.   The fact that we went 9-7 last year is a good sign considering the Chargers had the second most games lost due to injuries.  The bad news is that the Chargers need to stop this injury bug. Good news is that the Chargers will have a new team doctor, IIRC. Who knows if it will make a difference, though.  In my opinion, there's no reason we can't make the playoffs and make a run if we stay healthy. Positive things to look out for that you didn't already mention include (but are not limited to)... (1) Melvin Gordon behind a more stout O-line with a now sophomore starting center, and a big upgrade at Left Guard, (2) Danny Woodhead, who tends to stay healthy not including last year, is back and ready to roll, (3) Jason Verrett had surgery that hopefully helps keep his shoulder injury from causing him to miss games, (4) Denzel Perryman looks like he will lay down some nasty hits, (5) Jacoby Jones adds something to the return game we have sorely missed for a while now, (6) Stevie Johnson quite possibly making the team better even without Eddie Royal, (7)  Brandon Flowers (CB) re-signed, along with the very underrated King Dunlap (LT), and finally, (8) Brandon Oliver (RB), Keenan Allen (WR), Malcom Floyd (WR), Corey Liuget (DE), Dontrelle Inman (WR), Darrell Stuckey (S, Special Teamer), ... Hell, even unproven but possibly very impactful guys like Manti Te'o, Ladarius Green, and Jerry Attauchu, and guys who need to prove something like Melvin Ingram and Donald Butler.  The talent is all in place. It's a matter of staying healthy and finishing the job. With the pieces you mentioned, like Rivers and Gates, it's a scary ass team.  You made a good choice following the Bolts, and I don't think you'll regret it. :)"
Chargers,3djzwz,toekneebalogna,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:38:08 2015 UTC,"I generally agree, but I have a whole 8 hours of work before the weekend starts, so I need something to rant about.  Team doctors aren't going to unbreak a fibula, untear a labrum, untear an ACL, or even actively prevent those things from happening during a game.  It's a contact sport.  Everyone is injured to some degree all the time, and some get it worse than others with a single hit on a single play.  Assuming that magic medicine is going to keep a team from getting injured is like blaming the training staff ""ooh, they didn't stretch long enough"".  It's part of the game.  We're talking about a guy who ran a university's sports medicine program for several years before coming here (leagues above that unethical hack we had, mind you), and has seen just about everything in terms of injury.  He's not going to prevent injuries, but he will appropriate and direct people to care as needed.  Suggesting that somehow magic medicine could have fixed our injury bug is like suggesting that magic training could somehow have fixed it.  These guys have literally spent the entirety of their working lives in their profession, read extensive literature and generated a network of professional contacts to come up with what they believe to be the best courses of training/dieting/fixing injuries.  It's not like coaching or being a GM, where ""so and so is a bad coach because his team hasn't won in the last decade, and can't adapt to the ever-changing NFL landscape"" - no... these guys have built a profession around empiricism, staying up to date on literature, and keeping player health at the forefront.  The ignorance of this sub in that regard just astounds me. </rant>"
Chargers,3djzwz,TheFakeTomTelesco,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:09:54 2015 UTC,"I hear you. The guy wasn't around long enough for me to even dislike him, and you're right, it's not really up to the doctors so much to prevent injury, though they should help to prevent re-injury.  Poor care can lead to someone coming back too soon, not healing up correctly, etc. But I'm probably still just sour from the terrible Dr. Chao. You can't say that the ""NFLPA saying he was failing to provide adequate care for his players"" is in no way connected to possible re-injuries, and being put back on the field too soon, OR even being kept off the field too long (things that the doctors have a say in).   The truth is that neither of us know either way, really, how much any team doctor helps or possibly hurts a situation.   Like I said, I definitely hear what you're saying. But I don't think we have to have a total disconnect between team doctors and injuries, and there are definitely good doctors and doctors who are not as good, even if they have reached a point in their career to get hired by a pro team."
Chargers,3djzwz,Duffman5755,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:24:16 2015 UTC,"Now I don't disagree - he lost suits for malpractice twice (although that really isn't all that uncommon, especially for surgeons - one of the reasons why our medical care is so damn expensive), but the issue I took with him was his DUI and the DEA investigation... it just reeks of him not being the highest character kind of guy, and really that's what worried me.  You'd start to wonder if he'd be pushing people through rehabilitation quicker for a chance at a bigger paycheck or job security.  The players themselves didn't necessarily hate him (Hardwick and Rivers went on record to say that they like his care), but I think the NFL PA wanted someone better (and less sketchy), so they pushed him through a third-party doctor panel (which he passed) and kept pushing.  I think we upgraded, and I was actually sorry to see most recent guy go."
Chargers,3djzwz,Nmilne23,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:36:56 2015 UTC,"Your right on that, a new doctor isn't really going to make much of a difference.  The team doctor is mostly responsible for the day to day stuff.  Think of them as a ""family practice"" doctor.  They'll deal with a lot of team sickness stuff, and things like giving guys stitches and stuff like that.  I don't know too much about how the NFL is set up, but I have extensive exp with the sports medicine side of college sports, and know a lot about that.  If it's pretty similar, the biggest impact a team doc will have on the preventative measure side of things is that they are generally one of the head people when it comes to hiring Athletic Trainers (who can do quite a bit of movement screens and identify muscle imbalances that players have, and generally they work with the S&C staff to put players through activities that will improve those muscle imbalances), and even nutritionists, and potentially sports scientist teams (that is if they have a program for that, I know one of Philly's guys personally).  Most major injuries are ones that your not going to prevent, ACL tears, broken bones (are almost unpreventable in certain situations).  What the goal of every team should be is to 1. limit the amount of soft tissue injuries (read: Muscle injuries, soft tissue actually includes tendons and ligaments too, but its used to describe muscle issue mostly), and 2. reduce day to day fatigue, that can contribute to preventing people from being in the position of instability that can cause some of the more serious injuries.  Injury prevention mostly falls on some of the athletic training staff, the strength and conditioning staff, the nutrition staff and the coaches to do they're research and figure out how to structure practice to avoid it.  Some of it is just going to be dumb luck, injuries happen in sports, but its about using all the different departments together to figure out whats the most effective, if each do they're research right.  Thats one reason that I think Chip Kelly is so successful. I know when he came to Oregon he came to every group listed above, and asked for advice on how to run his practices, even the nutritionists.  Chip stays up on the latest info for everything and keeps what he's doing along those guidelines.  Too many coaches IMO are stuck in they're ways and don't want to adapt to different info."
Chargers,3djzwz,ace-destrier,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:39:54 2015 UTC,Ryan Mathews was perpetually hurt. Danny Woodhead broke his leg in the 1st game of the season. P Mike Scifres got destroyed in a game and his season was over. Philip Rivers hurt his back pretty bad at some point midseason but started every game regardless. Just about every week we lost a center. S Jahleel Addae and CB Brandon Flowers suffered some bad concussions. I think Flowers might have been hurt one other time. A shoulder injury cut CB Jason Verrett's rookie season short. eta: TE Ladarius Green got hit hard and was out for a little while.  Those are the ones I remember off the top of my head.
Chargers,3djzwz,BobTaco,3,Fri Jul 17 03:01:01 2015 UTC,"Varrett only played 6 games. Flowers missed games. Ingram missed a lot of games. Buttler was playing injured and needed surgery in the offseason. Te'o hurt his other foot and was out 5 weeks. Mathews basically missed the whole season. Woodhead had a season ending injury week 3. Donald Brown missed 4 games from a nasty cuncussion. Hardwick season ending injury week 1. Went through 2 more centers with season ending injuries after Hardwick went out. Even Watt was injured for a bit. Fluker was playing injured. One of the guards was injured in the 49ers game and missed at least one week after that. Gates was playing with injuries (which may have lead to the PED test issue), Rivers was playing with a bulging disc for the 2nd half of the season. Allen missed the last 2 weeks which is why Inman had to save the day. Also Green got killed in the Pats game towards the end of the season. Schifres the punter almost died because Brown sucks at blocking, season ending injury. I think that was it? At least that was it for the starters...  Going 9-7 with that bitch of a schedule and that many critical injuries...holy shit. Don't really realize it until you type it all out...I just got so damn numb to the injuries...  Edit: kept remembering injuries...dear god how did that team even survive?"

Lol. The misery all my friends here seem to constantly be exposed to is tough to watch.   But, if you can watch objectively, the Chargers are fuckin fascinating. Absolutely a blast to watch and learn about. Young and talented Keenan Allen. That which is Felipe Rios, the stadium drama, how Antonio Gates seems like a giant that's running in slow motion yet he's constantly open and completing catches, no matter how well they do they won't be talked about on PTI. Plus there's at least one exciting rookie prospect. It truly is fun to watch if the final outcome doesn't matter to you.   The people in this sub are cool too. Good sense of humor. Almost always very respectful. Have fun with other subs. It's a jolly good time.   Welcome to San Diego mother fucker!"

Many of the seats in view are horrible and you can't really see the action.  The screens are way undersized and poor quality.  ... the list goes on.  We need a new stadium..
Chargers,3dg7ym,tubetop2go,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:29:38 2015 UTC,It wasn't designed for baseball. The Pads just used to play there. It was an awkward baseball setup. It's just old
Chargers,3dh5bg,redbeardedone,13,Thu Jul 16 06:02:28 2015 UTC,"This is what happens when you're literally picking up a C off the street and starting them the next week, with a weeks worth of knowledge of the playbook.  It just screws everything you could possibly hope to do on offense.  Also something you didn't mention, almost half the times our RB's were hit behind the line, they were getting hit 3 yards deep.  Too many people shit on Donald Brown without realizing how little he had to work with.  He had 83 attempts last year, and got hit 3+ yards deep in the backfield on 10 of those, meaning one of every 8 carries, he's getting hit essentially as he gets the ball.  Then an additional 11 times (totaling 21 times getting hit in the backfield) he was hit behind the line, almost 1/4 of his rushing attempts...   With how much better our OL is this year, we should see an entirely different running game, especially from Donald Brown, who's always been kind of just a ""take what you can get"" type RB.  He's not going to be flashy and break off many huge runs, but when you give him a hole, he rarely misses it and will get 4 or 5 yards out of it.  When you give him nothing, there's absolutely nothing that he's going to do."
Chargers,3dh5bg,Duffman5755,5,Thu Jul 16 06:48:14 2015 UTC,"If this O-line is what we all expect (and hope) it is, every single one of our backs will flourish. They all have different skillsets, and with a healthy, actually good O-line, we'll really be able to see what each of them is capable of. And with a great running game, our passing game gets helped immensely. Anyone else excited to see Rivers   to Stevie? I know I am. Is it football season yet?"
Chargers,3dh5bg,rezyy013,3,Thu Jul 16 07:00:31 2015 UTC,"This OL is going to be very interesting.  This is the first year of his NFL career where Joe D has 100% of guys that he picked out (had a lot of guys that he obtained from previous regimes, this OL is entirely guys that he brought in, at least on the starting 5).  So if there is a year where thing are going to go right on the OL, this is where we should see the development.  I'm still not ruling out Chris Hairston giving serious competition to Joe Barksdale for whatever position on the right side that Fluker doesn't take (Hairston has extensive history at both RG and RT, Barksdale has played RG some IIRC as well as a ton of exp at RT, and Fluker hasn't ever played there, I wouldn't be surprised at all if Fluker ends up as the RT, while many people are saying its a guarantee that he is going to be the one that moves to RG).  Thats mostly because Joe D drafted him in Buffalo and he played very solidly for the year or two he was in Buffalo at RT.  It all depends on how much chemistry they're able to build.  Stevie Johnson runs some uh........unique.....routs.  There's so much wasted motion in all of them and so much randomness that its almost impossible to have consistent timing with him, so Rivers is going to have to learn how to deal with that, especially coming from guys like KA, Floyd and Royal, who are all pretty clean/precise rout runners."
Chargers,3dh5bg,Duffman5755,6,Thu Jul 16 07:26:59 2015 UTC,Mathews and Brown are the 2 backs most often hit in the backfield. I'm really excited for a healthy O-line with potentially two of the best run blocking guards in the league with Franklin and Fluker (if he moves inside).
Chargers,3dh5bg,ratchatat,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:04:41 2015 UTC,"That chart represents the number of times a RB was hit 3 yards deep in the backfield.

Pipe dream, unfortunately.     as long as we're playing make believe, whats our club name?   I'd hate a euro name (United, City, etc.) and I'd want a San Diego mascot.  San Diego Sculpins?

Chargers,3dgdu2,sleetzero,2,Thu Jul 16 03:51:05 2015 UTC,I think the reason is that a lot of the Mexican community living in San Diego either already supports Xolos or they have another team from Liga MX. Also not many Mexicans like the MLS. Many even follow Xolos and another team so getting those people to become fans of this team can be hard.  I focused my answer on Mexicans because it is their top followed sport in most cases and because of the large number of them here in San Diego. It's certainly possible to have a team here and enough fans but maybe not as many as it would seem.

If Spanos had been smart, he would have joined Kroenke for a combined Rams/Chargers Inglewood stadium. I think they got greedy trying to be the only team in SoCal but thrown off by Kroenke's moves so they had to make a desperate play and combine with the Raiders for a new stadium in Carson.

Chargers,3ddnz3,sounddude,2,Wed Jul 15 18:23:01 2015 UTC,"they had a fair shot over the last 15 years. That stadium should have been replaced when building costs were down. Everyone knows that, this is a hail mary and it was likely land out of bounds with the NFL."
Chargers,3ddnz3,dannymac1784,2,Wed Jul 15 18:55:26 2015 UTC,"this whole 15 years doesn't really hold up.  sure the chargers presented plans to the city, but most of that time the city was going through a major pension crisis followed a national recession.  no way any elected official could have promoted a stadium project.  would have been career suicide and the chargers should have known it would have been impossible.  as soon as the city wants to seriously negotiate and get a plan put together, the chargers cut bait.  fuck them."

Chargers,3ddnz3,dannymac1784,0,Thu Jul 16 06:15:57 2015 UTC,"Everything the Chargers have asked for, they got.  They're just jacking everyone around now.  What they really wanted all along is for San Diego to just give up so they can go to the NFL and claim there is no hope and get an easy vote for the move.  We're not giving up without a fight.  Good for the city for pushing forward.   Keeping our team is worth the fight.  I know it is."
Chargers,3dgtr0,tbeeezy,2,Thu Jul 16 04:00:40 2015 UTC,"It means something might be in your way. For example, if you're sitting Plaza-obstructed view, a pillar will probably be in the way. I went to a Chargers-Ravens game a few years back at the Q, and we had Field-Obstructed View. We were sitting on the Ravens sideline, in the second row, so the Ravens bench was in the way. All their players and coaching staff, equipment and such. And it really didn't affect our view of the game at all! We could see perfectly fine. I'd imagine obstructed view at the endzone might be the goal post, or cameras or something."

Here is the virtual venue picture from my section.   If you look closely, near the leftside uprights you can see a little dark blue overhang. That's the door the visitors come out of. It's not a tunnel, just a door. So if you sit in 14, you'll maybe catch their faces when they head back in. If you sit in my seats, though, you'll see everyone because the visiting team is facing you on their sidelines, but obviously they'd be further away. :)"
Chargers,3dgtr0,bman86,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:05:50 2015 UTC,In this seats you will be close and down low. NFL players are big and it will tough to see the field at times because they are in the way. Plus you're going to standing pretty much the entire game.

If SD has a solid stadium plan in place, the NFL will most likely deny any LA plans by the Chargers. The Chargers are set on leaving, but Kroenke is pretty much as good as gone from St. Louis and while I think Davis wants to stay in Oakland, the city has pretty much told him he's not getting a new stadium.  It's in the Chargers best interest to play down any advancements by the city because someone at this point isn't getting to move."

Another resounding No. Pay it yourself Spanos.  Is not that I love the sports arena, I just don't like giving it away, is a city asset, not a Chargers asset."

Give them the opportunity to piss off their fan base, and start building a new one, in whatever city they want. Have the NFL vote on relocating from San Diego, and loosing TV ratings for the  10th largest city in the US. If they want to do so, they are a private company, they can do that. That doesn't upset me, is a business decision, but stop with all the drama, negotiating in bad faith, saying they want to stay when they have a foot out the door. Just leave or stay, but make up your mind about it."

Chargers,3dbjxv,xtra_cReddit,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:31:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but neither of them were then what they are today. McCarthy spent a few seasons fixing Rogers' throwing motion without him ever having the pressure to play. He has only ever played in one system and has had a pretty good team surrounding him most of that time as well. It was basically a perfect scenario for developing a young QB. Smith went into an organization that had been doing poorly and had the burden of trying to turn it all around. He was forced to start immediately, didn't get a chance to refine his game but instead was thrown into the fire, and had no consistency in his coaching or offensive scheme until Harbaugh came in. He was actually starting to do well until Kaepernick came onto the scene and ran all over defenses. I think his early struggles in SF were what caused him to be as safe a passer as he is today."
Chargers,3dbjxv,IamMrT,2,Fri Jul 17 00:02:18 2015 UTC,I in large part agree but still...in a controlled environment Rodgers > Smith

So, sure the city could do that, but only if they want the Chargers to leave and get screwed.  ETA: And it'd probably screw both the team and the city.  On top of being out a few million dollars, and be absolutely guaranteed to never get another NFL team, Spanos might be within his rights to Sue for Damages; loss of the ability to move concurrently with/prior to the Rams could impact the value of the Chargers, and we might end up on the hook for those damages.

Chargers,3dbc5i,JanitorOfSanDiego,3,Tue Jul 14 23:45:27 2015 UTC,"SD wants to keep the Chargers, and have been pushing hard to do so (at, y'know, a bureaucratic pace) since somewhen around the Carson Plan reveal.  The problems are these:   State bureaucracy requires an Environmental Impact Report The EIR process can be done fast (in time to present to Spanos/NFL before their owners meeting where they'll decide the fate of LA) or effectively lawsuit proof (cutting the likelihood that it'd need to be done again before moving forward) Spanos really doesn't want to lose his rights to the LA market (which is roughly an order of magnitude more valuable than the San Diego market).  Indeed, he really can't afford to lose that market, especially if he throws a lot of money into a new Stadium.   If the EIR can be completed quickly enough, and it is solid enough to build a plan on, and the NFL can convince Spanos that leaving isn't in his best interests... then the Chargers are likely to stay.  If any of those fail...  Well, it will have been a good 55 years."

He could be great LarDarius Webb or what Webb has become.  We know what Flowers is, we know what Weddle is.  Patrick Robinson and Mager are a solid 3rd/4th CB group (with HUGE upside on Mager, reminds me a bit of Phillip Gaines from last year, but didn't get the same hype pre-draft).  SS is kind of an unknown.  Addae has good and bad flashes, but is still really young and could solidify himself as a good starter this year, but I don't think he's a liability.

We've clearly established that we want big, long blockers along our OL for our system (which is similar to Wisconsin's).  Not saying that a more athletic guy cant be good in our scheme (see Levitre when Joe D was in Buff), but that clearly isnt the ideal.  If you're going to have to pay big money to a guy like that, everything has to be perfect.  It adds to the problem that he's 33 years old and was unhappy with his 7m salary this year and supposedly wants 10-ish mil per year.  I'd absolutely pass on that.  We've added 1 bonafied starter along with 2 others who could potentially start games for us (I'm still not entirely counting out Chris Hairston beating out Roger Saffold for a starting spot at either RG or RT, with Fluker playing the other spot)"
Chargers,3da1t2,Duffman5755,4,Tue Jul 14 22:44:08 2015 UTC,No at this point we don't need a 33 year old guard that's gonna command a hefty sum. I think we have the pieces already to have a good line so I really hope we don't actually get him.
Chargers,3da1t2,basedcharger,2,Tue Jul 14 20:54:44 2015 UTC,"I will say that Tom Telesco has pulled some magic before, and if Mathis is playing the market and realizing he is old on paper and won't get the big contract he was looking for, maybe there's a chance.   I agree that we have decent pieces now in place, but you can't say it wouldn't be killer to have him at a good price. Look what a dominant O-line did for Dallas...

Chargers,3d6u35,MuaddibMcFly,9,Tue Jul 14 01:01:37 2015 UTC,"Although SD is one of the 10  biggest cities, that's because much of the SD metro area is the city of SD. We're only actually the 19th largest metro area. SD has a tendency to think it's bigger than it really is."
Chargers,3d6u35,timster,11,Tue Jul 14 03:40:31 2015 UTC,"True.  That still means we're larger than at least 13 other markets that currently have NFL teams, and there is no sense alienating us if there isn't a reason to do so."
Chargers,3d6u35,MuaddibMcFly,7,Tue Jul 14 05:02:52 2015 UTC,"We're the 5th largest county.   It's a great location for weather, not so great for a TV market. Braketed on all four sides by LA, the desert, the ocean, and Mexico."
Chargers,3d6u35,Crippled_Giraffe,2,Tue Jul 14 14:38:57 2015 UTC,"Given how you can get SD TV in TJ, I'm surprised that for things such as this, they don't factor that in."
Chargers,3d6u35,timster,4,Tue Jul 14 16:05:20 2015 UTC,But we're the second biggest city in California right?
Chargers,3d6u35,LukeNeverShaves,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:57:51 2015 UTC,"Well yes, but the city of San Francisco, for example, is pretty tiny geographically speaking, whereas when you factor the total market size it's quite a bit bigger."

Chargers,3d6u35,LukeNeverShaves,2,Tue Jul 14 16:30:00 2015 UTC,"Could be either, I suppose. Or both.   For now I think they are content to let things play out however they play out because they don't lose unless NO team moves to LA, which is very unlikely at this point. I doubt they'd have a problem with one in SD and one in LA. Even if they prefer 2 in LA and none in SD, (and I don't know the numbers, but) I doubt they'd fight it if the Chargers worked something out in SD and say the Rams were in LA."
Chargers,3d6u35,toekneebalogna,2,Tue Jul 14 01:21:52 2015 UTC,"I doubt they'd have a problem with one in SD and one in LA. Even if they prefer 2 in LA and none in SD,    I can't imagine they would prefer two in LA to one in LA and one in SD.  The problem is that the financial gains are such that it is unquestionably a better business move for Spanos for the Chargers to maintain at least 50% claim on the LA market.  Again, though, my dream scenario is for the NFL to declare that a move into the Chargers' market (LA) means that a portion of the Local Income (which is not shared among the 32 teams) be shared with the Chargers as compensation for lost market (or split both markets' local revenue 50/50, or 67/33, or whatever).  That would make it not a horrible business move for Spanos, would set a precedent that the NFL owners would like (a penalty for muscling in on their markets), and maintain the good will of the San Diego market (by keeping the Chargers in SD [WHERE THEY FREAKING BELONG!])"

Chargers,3d6u35,GreatestDenier,7,Tue Jul 14 04:59:18 2015 UTC,"They moved forward with the EIR by getting rid of the plan to develop the land because that ruined their plan to speed up the EIR. Now it is 100% a stadium for a stadium. It has a smaller footprint and smaller capacity too. Using their old EIR for a template is now an over estimation more or less.   This ruins the plan to sell that land to pay for their contribution. But, that doesn't mean they can't do separate EIRs for development projects in the future. So they can still get most of the money back by selling the land...it just can't be done as part of this project. Now SD needs to figure out how to get that money another way before they can attempt to make it back developing the mission valley site down the road."
Chargers,3d6u35,BobTaco,5,Tue Jul 14 10:02:58 2015 UTC,"It's like the Chargers are actively seeking the awkward ""living with an ex"" outcome.  I imagine the NFL is pretty upset with them for not negotiating in good faith, because that is only going to bring bad press, questions from politicians and probably law suits.  Between the John Oliver report, and Obama trying to block bonds being issued for stadiums, the league knows that it can't have a messy move otherwise it might kill the whole golden goose with stadium deals.  I think the team is one or two missteps from the NFL actively blocking their move, as a way to sidestep the absolutely radioactive situation a bad faith move would create.    My ""bold"" predictions is that they burn their bridges, but end up having to stay in SD because they putz up the move.  It will really then be on the team to win enough to woo the fans back (which might be a pretty tall order for an aging Rivers or a new/rookie QB).  Or, put another way, that uncomfortable, awkward situation of living with an ex"
Chargers,3d6u35,anoff,7,Tue Jul 14 02:41:42 2015 UTC,"I'm a Chargers fan originally from LA, away for school. Earlier in this whole fiasco, like a year or so ago, I would've loved the Chargers to move to my hometown. Now, it seems that would include Philip Rivers' departure as well as sharing a stadium with the Raiders (ew). I wanted them to move but not like this. NOT LIKE THIS. I hope they stay in SD because it doesn't seem healthy for them. Like it would tarnish the very essence of what the Chargers are. The soul of the team if you will. I'm at an [8] btw."
Chargers,3d6u35,avee10,4,Tue Jul 14 08:45:31 2015 UTC,"The Rivers thing is moot if you think long term. But let me be clear that I do NOT want to see him in another jersey.  Now the Raiders thing I can agree with, but, again, you have to think long-term. The two would more than likely not be in the same conference anymore. It would be sad to end the rivalry, but people would eventually move on. Stories would be told, sure, but that would be it.  Again, NOT that I like the idea. I'm just expressing the situation from a different viewpoint.  And I think you're right about tarnishing what the Bolts are. You definitely don't want another Browns situation where it seems like they just can't win because their heart was ripped out. But maybe that's just perception when it comes to the Browns because of how their franchise has gone since their own debacle. Would the Bolts be more like the Ravens or more like the Browns? I say the Browns because it seems like LA is ready to support the Rams or the Raiders more than the Chargers."

So, if I, as a fan, am that fungible, then so too are the Bolts if they move.   Not sure who I would root for (Rest of AFC West is out, and I live in Denver so.. yea) but it sure won't be the Bolts."

Chargers,3d979c,tnt6656,3,Wed Jul 15 17:53:59 2015 UTC,No. My love for san diego is equaled by my hatred for the oakland raiders. Ill hate them no matter where I am

Chargers,3d979c,tnt6656,3,Thu Jul 16 16:57:38 2015 UTC,"I'd have my silver spikes the very next week.  ...I'm being a bit facetious about all this. Of course it wouldn't be an easy transition. I think I'd have a very hard time not cheering for Rivers and some of my other favorite chargers if they left town.   HOWEVER, if by some twist of fate the Chargers leave and another NFL team moves to SD (not going to happen), then yes I would support my local team. Cheering for the Chargers is a sense of civic pride for me. This is the same reason that I already have some SD gulls merchandise on the way. Civic pride."
Chargers,3d979c,codeByNumber,2,Thu Jul 16 17:09:23 2015 UTC,I get that. Also its gonna be badass having a hockey team back in san diego and on top of it they're the ahl affiliate (sp?) of my favorite team.

I've gone back and forth on this for a while. But it's clear now that the owners don't care about the fans. I don't understand what they're thinking, if the Raiders (blech) and Rams both end up back in L.A., why the heck would having a 3rd L.A. football team be a good idea? L.A. already has a history with the Rams/Raiders. Many people up there are fans of either of those teams. I love the group of players we have now and I would hate to stop rooting for them.

Chargers,3d5sph,highastronaut,2,Tue Jul 14 01:27:43 2015 UTC,"The coliseum, while older, is nicer than the Q. USC has been pouring money into it the last few seasons. Second biggest replay screen in college football, renovated bathrooms, high quality food vendors, etc. No real luxury boxes, but for the average joe, the Coliseum as it stands now provides a much better gameday experience than the Q. That's the nature of NFL Relocation deals. They have to get the hell out of whatever city they were originally located in before they start building their new stadium. It takes at least 1 year to build a stadium, and there is already growing unrest among San Diegans and Charger fans over the speculation of the team leaving. Can you imagine how much bigger the backlash would be if they broke ground on Carson while still playing at the Q? No one would show up to games. Seems like they're gone, which is a shame. I wish that there was a way that we could get a deal done that benefits the city/fans and the team, but it seems there's no middle ground."

Weddle just got into the spotlight last season, but he's not more famous. Keenan Allen is probably in the top 5, as is Melvin Gordon. But no one knows who Melvin Ingram is. Te'o is top 3."
Chargers,3d71l5,MikeMcNorv,9,Tue Jul 14 16:08:44 2015 UTC,"Weddle just got into the spotlight last season?? Not a chance. He was the highest paid safety in the league when he signed his current deal. He's been recognized as top 5 at his position for a while. And yes, Te'o was famous before the gf thing, but only as a solid LB in college, not even enough for a first round pick. Allen's rookie year made him widely known throughout the league. Melvin Ingram was just as much of a stud in college (maybe more) as Te'o was, so if you're gonna say Manti was famous before the gf thing, then Ingram was/is also famous for the same reason. Also Flowers is very well known. Aside from his last couple of years in KC, he's always been considered a top 10ish CB. Manti is nowhere near top 10 at his position."

But yes, Weddle got into the spotlight last season. He was great before, but he never had the attention of the national media before then. Allen made a name for himself in his rookie year, that's unarguable. Flowers is well known, that's unarguable. But when it comes down to who is the most recognizable Charger, I'd be willing to bet a lot of money on Te'o to crack the top 3.

Do you know why he put the upper limit on the Chargers contribution to a new stadium around $200M?  Because that's roughly his net worth beyond the Chargers.  If he were a multi-billionaire, that'd be great, but you know what happens when someone who can't afford to buy a new stadium is (effectively) told that he has to do so anyway?  He buys land in a neighboring city where he can get investors to help him out in doing so (see: Carson)."

Chargers,3d5dj5,JennerUntucked,34,Mon Jul 13 17:34:24 2015 UTC,"19-0.  Rivers MVP.  Has 12 more kids from a single night of passion with his wife, since at this point, he has become mega-alpha.  Sets career records for yardage, TD's, and most Catholicism in a single season.  New Underwater Stadium in Coronado Bay provided by the recently enriched Spanos family, who vow to run the Chargers like a charity after making billions on the franchise via merch sales, movie rights, book deals, as Gates, Rivers, Gordon, Woodhead, Keenan, Floyd ALL have record-breaking seasons at their respective positions.  Fabiani goes back to being the deputy mayor of LA, where the Rams have moved permanently, their previous home market being invaded by the Raiders in what has been called ""unparalleled what-the-fuckery"".  Raiders go 0 and 16, and Amari Cooper turns out to be a double agent.  Danny Woodhead grows an extra shin bone of pure adamantium, which he uses to bash opposing players into submission.  Craig Mager turns out to be the greatest defensive back in the league, followed very closely by Jason Verrett and Eric Weddle (who has agreed to play for beard wax and Miracle Gro in lieu of pay).  Gates beats Gonzalez's career yardage, hitting >5,000 yds of receptions in a single season.  As a result of all of the sellout crowds, dressed in SD colors (who throw money on the field in a newly founded fan-celebration), San Diego wage growth shoots up and encourages investment, real estate growth, and the tech sector of SD comes up with the next big thing that keeps large tech companies fully employed.  Then AJ Smith writes a formal apology for existing, and also for the holocaust.  Coach McCoy and I finally get to joust from our Ferraris, being pulled by the best offensive and defensive lines in the league, respectively.  And I bathe in gatorade mixed with champagne every night.  McCoy gets violently ill from eating genetically engineered shellfish every day.  Frank Reich is visited by the ghosts of Chargers past, present, and future, and then buys a Christmas turkey, which he gives to Ladarius Green.  He vows to call more 2 tight end sets, given that the spirits that had visited him in the previous night had made him a changed man.  And to win the super bowl, McCoy, who did NOT die, calls a trick play on 4th and 1, and says ""God Bless us everyone!""."

Chargers,3d5dj5,miketheblade,5,Mon Jul 13 21:33:53 2015 UTC,They will win between 1 and 19 games. Quote me on that.  But seriously I'm gonna be pessimistic and say 10 wins...even though they should do better than that. There are always a few games that get caughed up for some stupid reason.
Chargers,3d5dj5,BobTaco,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:56:25 2015 UTC,You think 10-6 is pessimistic? You sound like an optimist.
Chargers,3d5dj5,predalienmack,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:37:43 2015 UTC,"Until injuries kick in, and everyone realizes the ""easy"" schedule isn't really that easy 10 is my most optimistic pesimistic prediction."
Chargers,3d5dj5,BobTaco,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:16:43 2015 UTC,"Haha well, I for one don't see the schedule as being nearly as easy as many people make it out to be, injuries or no."
Chargers,3d5dj5,predalienmack,5,Wed Jul 15 09:30:51 2015 UTC,8-8 Too many road games and division games to close out the year
Chargers,3d5dj5,gochargersgo,6,Tue Jul 14 15:35:32 2015 UTC,7-10 wins seems likely.
Chargers,3d5dj5,TheRisingTide,4,Mon Jul 13 18:04:56 2015 UTC,"We have an easier schedule than last year with a healthier team. Minimum ten, max 13"
Chargers,3d5dj5,TheRisingTide,7,Mon Jul 13 19:28:58 2015 UTC,"We have an easier schedule than last year   Yes.   with a healthier team.   ...Now.  That's the thing, every training camp and early season there's always a rash of season ending injuries. Be it Danny Woodhead or Malcom Floyd or Melvin Ingram, etc.  Also, again, assuming the team is going to do better than last year just because we won 9 games and improved the offensive line and secondary is optimistic, not necessarily a given. The last two seasons have seen the team work through the draft and free agency to improve some areas of the team, whereas others struggled due to injuries or, in the case of the defensive line, neglect.  I think saying 10 minimum wins as a given is one way to set yourself up for disappointment."
Chargers,3d5dj5,MyWifesABobcat,8,Mon Jul 13 19:39:19 2015 UTC,"I think saying 10 minimum wins as a given is one way to set yourself up for disappointment.   Yeah, i agree. 10 is a slightly optimistic viewpoint, but relatively realistic. But 10 minimum? This sub needs a reality check."
Chargers,3d5dj5,MyWifesABobcat,2,Mon Jul 13 19:52:40 2015 UTC,"Where have we gotten worse? I only see improvements. Now, those do include rookies and guys coming off injury, but I think 10 wins is very realistic."
Chargers,3d5dj5,kr0kodil,3,Mon Jul 13 20:16:26 2015 UTC,"Where have we gotten worse? I only see improvements.   You can say that about plenty of teams. We have only replaced our LG with a significant upgrade. We really haven't added anything else other than rookies that you can definitively 100% say are a big upgrade.    but I think 10 wins is very realistic.   I never said it wasn't. In fact, I said it was realistic as well. You said:   Minimum ten   10 realistic =/= 10 minimum. 10 minimum means we can't possible win less than 10 games."
Chargers,3d5dj5,salad_dressing_dude,3,Mon Jul 13 22:27:45 2015 UTC,"Pass rush has gotten worse with Freeney gone. The defensive line still stinks, at least on paper.   Teams with weak defensive lines and a poor pass-rush rarely make the playoffs."
Chargers,3d5dj5,ClevelandBrownJunior,2,Mon Jul 13 21:27:56 2015 UTC,"There is a big difference in 10 wins being realistic and being the minimum. Our minimum is 6-7, and that's with some big names getting injured. If we end up on par with last year for injuries, I think we can still end up at 10 because I like our depth more, but I would consider 10 wins a goal and not a floor."
Chargers,3d5dj5,greysanthony,-2,Mon Jul 13 22:22:04 2015 UTC,This. I think 10 is the very most we'll win.
Chargers,3d5dj5,Titan67,2,Mon Jul 13 18:10:37 2015 UTC,I think if we can get 10 wins we can get in the playoffs. Once were there who knows what team will show up
Chargers,3d5dj5,N8theSnake,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:40:02 2015 UTC,If the offensive line stays healthy and Ladarius Green lives up to his hype I can see them winning more than 9 games. If the defense had a nasty Nose Guard I would be drinking the kool aid and say super bowl
Chargers,3d5dj5,MikeMcNorv,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:56:58 2015 UTC,"Realistically, 10-6, but 11-5 wouldn't shock me."
Chargers,3d5dj5,MyWifesABobcat,-3,Tue Jul 14 14:44:49 2015 UTC,"can't decide between 9 or 10 wins. 9 wins is hoping other teams lose late in the year, 10 is controlling their own destiny. Team is good enough to win 10, but Mike McNorv is still the head coach, and he doesn't like winning. So because of him, and the injuries that are going to happen, they'll win 9 games again."
Chargers,3d5dj5,BobTaco,5,Mon Jul 13 18:47:11 2015 UTC,"You do realize that we won nine games without an offensive line or running game, right? McCoy should have been coach of the year."
Chargers,3d5dj5,predalienmack,7,Mon Jul 13 19:27:49 2015 UTC,McCoy should have been coach of the year.   lol
Chargers,3d5dj5,MikeMcNorv,2,Mon Jul 13 19:52:59 2015 UTC,Coach of the year gets into the playoffs with that kind of a situation. That didn't happen. But he has gotten more out of his teams than he should have been able to his first 2 years. That's not bad at all. A st cut down on the sketchy coaching flubs and all will be well.
Chargers,3d5dj5,MikeMcNorv,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:01:59 2015 UTC,"We also lost against KC's backups and threw away our control over making the playoffs. Definitely not all McCoy's fault, but also nowhere near coach of the year material."

Chargers,3d5dj5,MikeMcNorv,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:18:17 2015 UTC,"I'm in agreement. While I don't dislike him as much as Norv, I think time will show him to have the same issues. Lame ass conservative play calling. I remember 2013 when there was Chargers pulled that fake punt in OT against the Chiefs when the playoffs were on the line I shouted that McCoy had finally grown some balls. Found out afterward that that was all Weddle's balls calling that play. Last season shows that he still hasn't grown any. Remember the Patriots game last season when there was six minutes left in the game, the Patriots had a 9 point lead, and it was 4th and short, and the guy punts it? I think we may be in the minority here but I see him as Norv 2.0."
Chargers,3d6069,Ninjygingy,2,Mon Jul 13 20:11:11 2015 UTC,"Weather should be fine around that time of year. It doesn't really get too cold in Southern California and December isn't the coldest month of the year. Having said that, apparently we are expecting a big storm called El Nino this winter. Its supposedly going to be the biggest storm we have gotten since 1997 but I don't know if they are just being alarmist.   San Diego as a city is great. Its known for having the best beer in the country. Stone is the most popular brewery to visit but its not too close to the city and the brewery tour is kind of meh. On the other hand you can get good beer and good food and its kind of a mecca for Southern California craft beer. The city is also known for its zoo. I went there about a month ago. It might just be saying this because it was my first time at a zoo in well over a decade but I thought it was pretty awesome. Other than that, of course the beaches are nice but even if its sunny in December it might not make for the best beach weather because the water will be cold. Although coming from Calagary you might not be as picky about beaches as someone who grew up in So cal.    Hope you have an awesome time. Never been to Qualcomm so I can't give you any advice in that respect. Also eat lots of Mexican food. Southern California really does have the best Mexican food outside Mexico."

Chargers,3d5wum,pedantimous,2,Mon Jul 13 20:02:08 2015 UTC,"The cHargers aren't proposing anything of the kind. Look at just one aspect of the Carson proposal:  ""Using a tax-exempt public authority to sell personal seat licenses and sponsorships allows the teams to avoid many taxes on those sales, saving them tens, perhaps hundreds, of millions of dollars, Vrooman said. The teams would also avoid property taxes on the building, though they would pay rent and other local taxes on the private use of a public facility. Public agency bonds for the stadium would be tax exempt and sell at lower interest rates."" http://www.latimes.com/business/realestate/la-fi-stadium-goldman-20150524-story.html Tax breaks running from the tens of millions to the hundreds of millions of dollars sounds like public money to me. I don't think there's any chance any NFL stadium gets built without a substantial public contribution. How that transfer of wealth from the public to a billionaire team owner is accomplished/dressed up is another story."

He won't retire,  plain and simple, and he's too elite that we would let him go. We'll pay him top 5 money, and he'll take it. Weddle, that's a tough one. He's arguably the best now, but his body can only handle so much. I think after this year we offer him a 3-4 year contract, assuming production stays consistent, and he spends the last two years in a downgraded role (i.e. not 800 snaps). That said, if we lose Weddle after this year, it will be a big blow, but I'm not sure it would translate into us not being contenders the same way losing Rivers would. Reyes... I know I'm a loner on this, but I like him enough that I would trade two draft picks for him. He isn't top tier, but I think his main problem is he isn't being used to his strengths. He needs to be spelled more. Let him rush the passer one on one. Mathews or another can do run defense. That means taking up a roster spot and using two bodies for one position, so maybe that's why I'm not the GM, but I'd give him one more year and see if we can really make something out of this 3-4 4-3 hybrid they keep talking about. But that's just my thoughts on the hypothetical 2 draft trade senario."

Chargers,3cyjxq,MikeMcNorv,10,Sun Jul 12 02:42:16 2015 UTC,he's 25 years old.. he would be the future..
Chargers,3cyjxq,mrhashbrown,3,Sun Jul 12 03:17:48 2015 UTC,"Assuming they can re-sign him. It's risky because he's entering a contract year, so if he plays well the Chargers won't have any choice but to pay him a pretty hefty contract since he'll be difficult to replace (and it's clear he wants a big contract)."
Chargers,3cyjxq,BobTaco,3,Sun Jul 12 08:15:30 2015 UTC,Thank you. This plus the Rivers/Weddle situation makes things more complicated.
Chargers,3cyjxq,predalienmack,5,Sun Jul 12 15:28:50 2015 UTC,Wilkerson would change the face of our defense and potentially make our defensive line a strength rather than arguably our greatest defensive weakness.
Chargers,3cyjxq,cvjoey,2,Sat Jul 11 23:39:04 2015 UTC,I dont think it'd happen because they need him for when Richardson is suspended

Chargers,3cyjxq,cjmcclain,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:14:25 2015 UTC,Going a little fanboy here but I'm not opposed to all of this. It could work but I'm not ready to think about next year until the Chargers figure out stadium plans and how this year plays out. My hope is Weddle resigns and if San Diego stays (which I hope they do) then Rivers should be on board too. Wilkerson is a very nice player and would help with the defense a lot but I'm not ready to trade a 1st and a 3rd unless it guarantees more than being a contender.
Chargers,3cyjxq,bdubbz14,0,Mon Jul 13 14:59:40 2015 UTC,"I was going over NYJ depth chart, and they're pretty shit at ILB.

Chargers,3csy0g,TwinIon,2,Sat Jul 11 04:24:51 2015 UTC,"That's surprising, as it always seemed like the most likely temporary home for an NFL team. It is worth noting that this was simply a vote against the 'feeler' that the NFL put out. I don't believe a specific team is allowed to negotiate until they have the ok to move. If an NFL team were to get to that point and could really negotiate with specific terms, I wouldn't be surprised if the Rose Bowl were to reconsider.  The Coliseum is a much worse option, and everything else holds far fewer people. It'll be very important for whatever team(s) that move to not play a lame duck season and to have a reasonable temporary site to play in, so I have to imagine that a specific deal would be substantial."

Chargers,3clv3d,SanDiegoDude,9,Thu Jul 9 01:03:02 2015 UTC,Maybe. But Spanos could also claim that 14 years was in good faith.
Chargers,3clv3d,BobTaco,4,Thu Jul 9 02:06:43 2015 UTC,"Policy and Procedures for Proposed Franchise Relocations    Because League policy favors stable team-community relations, clubs are obligated to work diligently and in good faith to obtain and to maintain suitable stadium facilities in their home territories, and to operate in a manner that maximizes fan support in their current home community. ...  All clubs, at any time during their stadium negotiations, are free to seek the assistance of the League Office and the Stadium Committee, on either a formal or informal basis. If, having diligently engaged in good faith efforts, a club concludes that it cannot obtain a satisfactory resolution of its stadium needs, it may inform the League Office and the stadium landlord or other relevant public authorities that it has reached a stalemate in those negotiations. Upon such a declaration, the League may elect to become directly involved in the negotiations.    The NFL rep that visited San Diego back in April (iirc) said that the past 13 years of the Chargers working to get a stadium was their ""good faith"" effort. So, basically, the Chargers tried and couldn't get anything done with the city. Therefore, they are allowed to look elsewhere.  Many call bullshit on the Chargers' ""good faith"" effort because there are finally strides toward a stadium and the Chargers aren't giving the city a chance. They're doing the opposite, in fact, and shutting them down every opportunity they can.   I think the organization's down-low efforts to get something done in Carson while SD is still trying should totally negate the ""good faith"" from the past dozen years. But I know it doesn't work like that. Boo."

Our interior OL was one of the worst run blocking groups i've seen in a long, long time. If he got any space at all, he's a decent RB.  He's not a flashy guy, but he's the guy that if you give him a crease, he'll get you that 4-7 yards you need, consistently, on nearly every inside run just because of his good vision and ability to find just a little bit of space to sneak through."

Lets see how he does this year, I do believe that if he stays healthy he is going to be a top corner. And I say this most from his play at TCU, where he was a MONSTER."

And like Luck, is victim to the players around him...and shit luck of getting cockblocked by the Patriots. I hope both Rivers and Luck get the SB win they deserve. I hope Rivers gets it this year though. Luck has a long career ahead of him..."

Depending on what you're looking at (who you would rather have at QB, who you project will play well for the longest, who you would rather have call plays, etc.) I think Rivers falls in that Top 8-15 range, whereby it's incredibly difficult to replace him but let's not get ahead of ourselves."

Chargers,3cbivv,Bolt2006,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:57:33 2015 UTC,Rivers is great no doubt but Brady hasn't had all star athletes surrounding him the length of his career either and he's won multiple superbowls. Granted he's had an extra 5 years to work with.

Their path of least resistance is to let the prick move the team, sell it and they're rid of him. Unless they can force him to stay in SD and sell the team, but you are talking about an extra billion if he can move it to LA..."
Chargers,3cbfjt,TheRisingTide,11,Mon Jul 6 22:09:48 2015 UTC,"Probably, but who knows? Assuming the team is 100% machiavellian and not AT ALL incompetent is a gross mischaracterization of a team and a family that has fallen flat on it's face before."
Chargers,3cbfjt,UbiquitousMan,9,Mon Jul 6 16:47:18 2015 UTC,"I agree. This offseason just feels different as well, I feel less invested in the team and their moves. Very bummed out by the way I feel this is headed. I think for the Spanos family they care about their business first and foremost and will take the LA opportunity as it is more profitable. Can't blame them for it really, but a football team is so much more than just a business, especially to the city they represent."
Chargers,3cbfjt,jasonwhatis,4,Mon Jul 6 20:24:19 2015 UTC,This is exactly how I feel. It's hard to keep being invested in a team you love dearly when each week there seems to be something that comes out in the open.  Will be interesting to see what the crowd levels are like at games that's for sure.
Chargers,3cbfjt,EasilyAnnoyed,14,Mon Jul 6 20:40:10 2015 UTC,"What I've learned this offseason:  I am a fan of San Diego, not the Chargers. I am a San Diego man, born and raised. I take pride in my hometown. If they don't, fuck em. We can just as easily drop them for another team if they drop San Diego for Los Angeles.   Go ahead and downvote. This doesn't break reddiquette."
Chargers,3cbfjt,clearmindedyou,4,Tue Jul 7 02:56:15 2015 UTC,I feel the same way.
Chargers,3cbfjt,AndyofBorg,5,Tue Jul 7 14:04:58 2015 UTC,"I honestly believe The spanos Family Wants to sell the team, and could care less for the fan base and is willing to alienate all of us if it means selling the team for an extra billion. I want him to sell to someone who truely will treat this team with the respect it deserves. But i also would hate seeing the Spanos family making that much money after doing something so deceiving as to move a team purely to make more money."
Chargers,3cbfjt,BobTaco,4,Mon Jul 6 19:31:50 2015 UTC,"I agree 100%. This smells of cash grab. Burn your bridges with SD, move to LA, become hated by everyone because you're a scumfuck. Be ""forced"" to sell the team, new owner becomes a savior of the team, bad feels are dumped on Spanos but he and his brood have a billion dollars to cool their burns."
Chargers,3cbfjt,MarcoCheng,3,Mon Jul 6 22:05:47 2015 UTC,Who knows any more. Both sides have a blamethrower and are trying to spray it everywhere. There is so much going on behind the scenes we can't get an accurate picture of the situation.  I have to believe Dean knows that there is practically zero fanbase in LA...and there will be even less of a fanbase if they are competing with the Rams. The only question is if a $1 billion increase in team value is able to offset shitty sales of everything as well as the massive relocation fee. That depends on if Dean wants to dump and run or not.
Chargers,3cbfjt,MarcoCheng,2,Mon Jul 6 18:30:49 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I don't think so. They had nearly 20 years to move to LA, but chose to stay in San Diego, anyway. The only reason why they're acting so aggressive right now is because they're afraid of losing the general SoCal market to Rams (who are like 85% sure going to move), which is why I also think that the Carson deal with Raiders is bunch of BS as well. The NFL wants no more than two teams in the SoCal area (LA, SD, OC, IE, etc.), and they probably don't want to deal with realigning, as well as trying to build a stadium in a waste dump, while Stan Kroenke has a legitimate development plan. I think they've lost the race to LA, so now they're trying to do whatever they can to leverage a deal for a new stadium   If anything, they're more likely to move in with the Rams, then to have the Carson deal go forward, but I'm still not buying it 100%"
Chargers,3cbfjt,esoteryk,3,Mon Jul 6 19:51:11 2015 UTC,"It just seems that every time we turn around, the Chargers are speaking badly of SD and cozying up the the folks in LA."
Chargers,3cbfjt,SLAP_ME_SIDEWAYS,2,Mon Jul 6 20:02:33 2015 UTC,"It does seem like it, but again, it's more leverage and pressure. They're trying to make the city more desperate to keep them and to meet their own demands.  My 2 cents, though. I could be wrong, but I just don't think it's a definite as others are making it out to be"
Chargers,3c7rms,cvjoey,6,Sun Jul 5 18:14:46 2015 UTC,"Good. He really helped rally people against SF last year and played out of his mind that game...of course that one guy also made fun of his ""girlfriend"" situation so Te'o may have hulked out.

Chargers,3c7rms,jeffreyfour4,2,Mon Jul 6 03:24:42 2015 UTC,"Not really, usually you have a leader of the front 7 and a leader of the secondary. Te'o seems like he's going to be the leader in the way Butler was for us last year (was it Butler or JJ?). Leader of the front 7 usually has the headset and gets the plays and relays it.  The secondary's a lot harder to get stuff together because everyone's so far away.  It's kind of in the same mannor that the QB sets up everything for the offense, but its really the Center that sets everything up for the OL, even though he's not the ""leader"" of the offense."
Chargers,3c7rms,Duffman5755,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:59:20 2015 UTC,"No, just means he's stepping up as a leader rather than observer, he could be the intra LB corps leader"

Chargers,3c7rms,scrambles57,16,Sun Jul 5 22:35:23 2015 UTC,He's not bad. Right now he's the best ILB we have. He's been improving with every game.
Chargers,3c7rms,puppy_punter,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:45:32 2015 UTC,"He also missed, what, 10 games in his first 2 seasons? That's a tough hole to climb out of. Maybe someone can fact check me if they disagree, but I thought he produced a decent number of tackles, and each game he seems to be in a better position to make a play. And yes, while it's funny to see him be be the last guy to jump in on the dog pile after the play is over, I look at it as an indication of his attitude to never giving up, always being there just in case, and something that will pay off in the long run. Barring breaking another foot, I fully expect him to have a respectable season this year."
Chargers,3c7rms,riversfan17,2,Tue Jul 7 04:52:26 2015 UTC,"Well being the best of 4 rookies, an overpaid vet and a special teams player isn't too difficult. But I get what you're saying, I don't hate the guy and I hope the best for him, I just hope touting him as a solid leader doesn't buff the opinion of what he is on the field, however good or bad he may be out there this season."
Chargers,3c7rms,SunriseSurprise,5,Sun Jul 5 23:48:42 2015 UTC,"I think people forget that with us having gotten him in the 2nd round, he's probably about as good as we paid for. If he was in first round like where he was expected to be way before the draft, I could see calling him ""not very good"" as accurate. In reality, he's pretty solid and will continue to be a good contributor and hopefully continue getting better over time."
Chargers,3c7rms,riversfan17,-4,Sun Jul 5 23:48:14 2015 UTC,"I don't care where we drafted him, if he sucks he sucks and if he's awesome he's awesome.

Chargers,3c8ugt,IsThatSickInFinnish,20,Sun Jul 5 23:57:39 2015 UTC,"If I had to guess, I would say they think the distractions are going to be a problem for us. No injuries have happened yet, but between Weddle, Gates, and the Stadium issues, I think that's what's making us slide in their eyes."
Chargers,3c8ugt,toekneebalogna,2,Mon Jul 6 00:26:13 2015 UTC,"It could be a combo of that and that we've not had momentum on our side. We missed the playoffs after making the playoffs, ended up with the same number of wins, and sure injuries were a major cause, but we weren't without injuries the season before. Couple that with some of the issues you mentioned and bettors might be thinking ""what's a real indication that this team will do better than last season?""  Look at the team more closely and we all of course see a lot of improvements made, and our schedule should be easier this season, so I am personally confident despite the Gates news and the shit surrounding Weddle, but I can see why some people might think we're due to stay even or possibly decline this season.  The real wild card is our shiny new first round RB and the difference he'll make."
Chargers,3c8ugt,SunriseSurprise,8,Mon Jul 6 06:09:50 2015 UTC,I think it has more to do with hype surrounding other teams right now.
Chargers,3c8ugt,Lighterless,5,Mon Jul 6 00:42:15 2015 UTC,"Lots of bettors not putting money on the Chargers with the sports books, hence the slide."

Chargers,3c8ugt,Death_Star_,3,Mon Jul 6 02:26:19 2015 UTC,"The Chargers are pretty much a passing team and their #1 target is missing 25% of the season.  Their two #1-ish WRs are coming off down years.  And they have a rookie RB.  If Gordon were to get injured or just bust, it's just up to Oliver and Woodhead.  Then, the AFC is a tough conference.  Even though Brady is out 4 games, everyone knows that the Patriots are going to be in the playoffs, and I'd take the Patriots with Brady over the Chargers in the playoffs.  More importantly, the defense really a championship defense yet.  Verrett will be a huge factor.  The pass rush isn't quite there yet, so Ingram would be the 2nd biggest factor to me."
Chargers,3c8ugt,Padreschargers7,3,Mon Jul 6 07:24:52 2015 UTC,"We don't really have a #1 target. Our receiving corps are insane. Allen, Floyd, Johnson, Jones, and Inman. Adding 12 games of Gates, along with Green and Woodhead, and we are stacked."

Chargers,3c8ugt,Sprinklesss,3,Mon Jul 6 02:46:12 2015 UTC,"I don't think they think the Chargers got worse as a team, I just think they see us as having less upside. While we will likely make the playoffs, most don't see us as a realistic threat to be able to make it to the Superbowl, whereas a team like the Cardinals might be able to coast in with some absolute shut-down defense or something like that."
Chargers,3c8ugt,AndyofBorg,2,Mon Jul 6 23:13:52 2015 UTC,"Quite possibly risk that on top of all the problems, the Chargers aren't looking like a high integrity unit right now, people might expect them to tank the season to make the move to LA more palatable. Right now it seems like they're doing everything in their power to make San Diego want them to leave. A horrible season would be icing on the cake."
Chargers,3c8ugt,esoteryk,2,Mon Jul 6 02:06:10 2015 UTC,"I think our offensive line has improved significantly, and that was our worst position group last year in my opinion."
Chargers,3c8ugt,SanDiegoDude,2,Mon Jul 6 03:50:42 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of drama surrounding the team this year, and Vegas takes that into account. Relocation concern, Weddle disgruntled and refusing to play special teams (not good when a leader is upset), Gates suspension, unproven rookie RB, QB who ended last season with a pretty messed up back and choosing not to have surgery, and an offensive coordinator who didn't really impress anybody last year coming back for a sophomore try.  Finally, we're playing against a very tough division that was very solid last year (with the browns being the worst at 7 & 9)."

Chargers,3c8ugt,Duffman5755,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:58:40 2015 UTC,"Nobody's mentioned the division.  KC and Oakland are much better teams than they were at this time last year.  Neither team really got worse in any way, and both got better in a lot of areas.  We're going to have 6 really tough division games, and its pretty realistic chance we finish 3rd in the division (just as realistic as us getting 2nd, the Cheifs and us are pretty evenly matched for that 2nd spot IMO, and not far behind the Broncos depending on what Peyton we see), and I wouldn't be entirely shocked to see all 3 in the playoffs.  We're also playing the AFC North and NFC North, which are some of the most competitive teams in the league.  It also hurts coming off a year that we didn't make the playoffs and the view on our team is kind of down, as we stalled last year with all the injuries.  2 years ago we were coming off a year where we came on really strong and gave the Broncos a run to get to the AFC Title game. Expectations are going to be higher after that big run obviously, even though it may not mean as much."
Chargers,3c8ugt,Duffman5755,0,Mon Jul 6 04:39:29 2015 UTC,"Ya I think the Raiders look a lot better, too. But they are in ass last place in the odds. 400:1. That doesn't seem right. I could see them winning 5-7 games and with a miracle, even making the playoffs."
Chargers,3c8ugt,Kalima,2,Mon Jul 6 04:52:40 2015 UTC,"You also have to realize that a big part of it is that at this point, its a lot of people just putting money on they're own teams, so bigger fan bases will have an edge.  SD is a small fan base, and some fans are going to be more pissed off and lose their faith in the team, that could be a potential reason for it.  But through that, obviously bigger, more confident fan bases are going to bump the odds up, and smaller ones (like Us and Oak) are going to get bumped down.  The other part of it is the division, again, people see this as an insanely good division, and extremely unlikely that they come out of the division.  You're looking at this as a ranking system for teams.  Thats not what it is...its how likely they are to win the whole thing.  There's a lot of teams that are all or none (like KC, Eagles, etc etc) that are going to be viewed as having a better shot than the consistently good but not as talented teams."

There are many factors as to why people are betting for them. Internally, I think a lot of this has to do with the LA situation, and now recently with Gates' suspension; kind of why sliding below teams that are arguably worse than them. Externally, other teams are just getting more hype (Colts, Eagles, etc.), or else it has to do with strength of division"
Chargers,3c8ugt,TheRisingTide,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:25:21 2015 UTC,"Lots of distractions and bad stuff going on with the team - a) all the talk about moving to LA alienating the fan base, b) alienating their best defensive player Weddle, c) the potential of Rivers getting traded and all the bad publicity.  There's a very real possibility that this season could be impacted by some very poor morale with all the uncertainty."
Chargers,3ca0wb,zeehrob,11,Mon Jul 6 07:15:50 2015 UTC,"While the Chargers shun the stadium negotiating table, elected officials have plenty of time to ponder an inconvenient economic truth: If the team moves to Los Angeles, or anywhere else, San Diego could be considerably better off.  I don’t expect pointing this out to make me popular, given that a May poll indicated 72 percent of San Diegans were Chargers fans.  And how much better off depends on whether leaders make smart choices, namely about what to build next at an abandoned Qualcomm Stadium site.  A good start would be to fully appreciate why funding a new NFL stadium is such a bad business idea for the public.  For openers, it’s incredibly expensive. Based on recent NFL deals in mid-sized markets like San Diego’s, the Chargers are unlikely to settle for less than a $1.2 billion venue, with just $200 million or so coming from its owners.  About half of the construction cost, say $600 million, would come from the public. The rest, $400 million, presumably would come from fans as “seat licenses” and an NFL loan financed by club seat revenues, along with naming rights from an advertiser.  And the public generally doesn’t get an accurate estimate of longer-term costs, such as foregone property taxes, upkeep and operating subsidies, according to a 2012 study of public-private deals by University of Michigan planning and sports management professor Judith Grant Long.  Such hidden costs add 25 percent to the average total project, she estimated. If you’re keeping score at home, being average would push San Diego’s public tab to $900 million.  For a sense of how much money this is, the San Diego Association of Governments paid $341 million in 2011 for the South Bay Expressway; 10 miles of toll road carrying 12 million vehicle trips a year that otherwise might clog congested Interstate 805.  As for urgent needs, San Diego says it will fall short $1.7 billion for infrastructure repairs and upgrades over the next five years.  Yet all the money for a new stadium, public and private, however it’s sliced and diced, would probably buy little or no regional economic growth after construction is done, according to a slew of careful studies over the last two decades. Sports venues certainly generate sales, but the overall economic activity is generally the same — and often less — than what would have happened anyway.  Experts offer various explanations: The NFL’s millionaire players have high saving rates and often live elsewhere. Family entertainment budgets are finite, so catching a game simply diverts spending from something else. Even contributions from out-of-town fans are just drops in San Diego’s giant tourism bucket.  But what about the inevitable studies from stadium boosters showing gains? A 2001 Federal Reserve paper was polite: “The assumptions that are made in these studies — such as how much of the newly generated income will stay in the region and how many ‘secondary’ jobs will be created — often cannot be substantiated by economic theory.”  Even if you accept boosters’ claims of pro sports “multipliers” at face value, the jobs they posit are just too expensive. An analysis of the data used by Cincinnati officials to justify new stadiums to keep the Reds and Bengals found that the public would spend $147,000 for each job, before cost overruns.  Indeed, a 1994 study of 48 cities by economist Robert Baade found no measurable effects on growth in 30 cities that either lost or gained professional teams. As for the 30 that built or refurbished stadiums in the previous decade, he found just three cases of measurable effects — all negative.  Why would San Diego want to join that crowd? That boils down to the nonfinancial, psychological value of living in a major-league city.  Economists try to measure that, too, using surveys that ask people how much they would pay in higher taxes for various public amenities. Yet here again, the news is bad for stadium backers.  “It’s hard to find cases where the intangible benefits are big enough to justify the subsidies that go to these things,” said Bruce Johnson, an economist at Centre College in Kentucky who’s an authority on the subject.  The average willingness to pay adds up to about 20 percent of stadium subsidies, Johnson calculates. He hasn’t surveyed tax-averse San Diegans, but we can guess that our willingness is even lower, notwithstanding the team’s popularity.  Maybe that’s why Mayor Kevin Faulconer has ruled out asking voters for a tax increase, assuming the Chargers return to negotiate a deal.  Note that those studies looked at stadiums for all major sports. NFL venues, which cost more and are used less, tend to fare worse economically.  Yet a new Chargers stadium really looks bad compared to other public uses for the Qualcomm site. Leading the pack, by far, is higher education.  Expanding on a classic 1956 paper by Nobel Laureate Robert Solow, economists since the 1990s have argued that boosting “human capital” is key to further economic growth once basic resources, like money and raw materials, are in place. Put simply, building knowledge builds a better economy.  And for all its success, the local knowledge economy is constrained. Exhibit A is San Diego State University, which declines 70 percent of its applicants for admission.  The mayor’s preferred NFL stadium site in Mission Valley offers 160 acres of essentially open land just three trolley stops from the main SDSU campus, where nearly 29,000 full-time students are crammed onto 283 acres.  “Like the rest of San Diego, we’re waiting to see what happens between the mayor and the Chargers,” said state Sen. Marty Block, D-San Diego, who would push for state funding for SDSU expansion if the site becomes available. “If we keep them (the team) somewhere else in San Diego, downtown or wherever, that’s the best of both worlds.”  Early brainstorming imagines moving the college of sciences to the Qualcomm site, along with student and faculty housing, research offices and a smaller, cheaper stadium for Aztec football and perhaps a professional soccer team.  It’s important to note that enrollment caps owe more to state funding decisions than to physical limitations. Even so, the university can expand more efficiently in Mission Valley than by demolishing itself to rebuild into high-rises, and with less hassle for its already-stressed neighbors.  Enrollment has been essentially flat for a decade. To the extent such a project enables growth, the twin campuses would pump thousands of additional knowledge workers each year into the region to start businesses, find cures and spend their higher salaries.  A 2007 study projected that adding the equivalent of 10,000 full-time students would nearly double SDSU’s economic contribution to $4.5 billion a year by 2025.  Traditional private redevelopment offers less bang for the land buck, yet it still beats an NFL stadium. Although San Diego’s office and retail markets are glutted, housing and industrial space is tight and valuable.  The best private idea is probably that promoted by commercial broker Gary London, who wants to somehow draw the next Google or Facebook into town, tempted by the chance to build a big, unified corporate campus.  In the meantime, the Mission Valley parcel is public land, with a public discussion awaiting the conclusion of a deal with the Chargers, who’ve left the negotiating table to pursue a stadium in the Los Angeles market.  Those who value economic growth in San Diego may be rooting for them to succeed."

It is putting moetary value up against something that has no monetary value. So of course the numbers don't add up.   There are also a lot of assumptions being made, as well as data being pulled from old sources where stadium situations were very different and other better strategies have sense been used. For example, the Q really wasn't worth the renovations when the ticket buyout contract was put into place. Most places aren't that stupid anymore and those types of contracts don't exist, yet would be included in some of the studies being cited. Some cities got royally screwed like the new 49ers stadium. Said only had to pay for 10% of it...actually had to pay for 90%. Of course those stadiums weren't profitable. Stadiums tend to break even more than anything. That is excluding intangible benefits...which can't be reliably measured. A new stadium stands a better chance of making money than that library nobody iuses..."
Chargers,3ca0wb,BobTaco,2,Mon Jul 6 09:30:08 2015 UTC,"I think a big part of the problem with this is that some people always want to distill the public value of having an NFL team or a major league caliber stadium down to whether or not it produces a positive revenue stream for the city.  However, they conveniently overlook the fact that the same measuring stick is not necessarily used for every instance of money spent by the city.  If we apply the same logic used in this article, San Diego would be better off without public parks, libraries, a symphony, public works of art, clean, accessible beaches, and numerous other things that don't make money for the city.  As BobTaco said in his comment, this is about intangible benefits.  Ultimately it just comes down to whether individuals feel the intangible benefit is worth the price tag or not.  From my perspective, governments at all levels from the federal government on down to local municipalities waste money on all sorts of things all the time.  At least in this case they can waste money on something I care about."
Chargers,3c58md,Green89,8,Sat Jul 4 22:31:17 2015 UTC,"Hey guys,  I wrote an article on one potential sleeper for every team in our division, and chose to go with Addae as ours. Honestly, it was really tough picking just one. I had in mind Ladarius (but he's probably gotten too much attention because of FF players), Stevie (1,000 yard WR who's never had a good QB and is literally uncoverable at times because of the way he runs routes) and Attaochu, but there's so many more. I'm probably way too optimistic haha.  If you could only pick one sleeper for us next year, who would you go with? I also like guys like Tyrell Williams and Titus Davis, but picking UDFA's to do well is pretty much like betting on the Raiders to win a game - you might get it right once in a blue moon, but every other time you're going to look pretty stupid."

Chargers,3c4ggu,FelipeFuckingRios,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:57:03 2015 UTC,Haha I was just seeing what our potential stable of back is going to look like and how we will rotate them. I mean we are all tired of run on 1st and 2nd but with Gordon I think we can have a much better run game.
Chargers,3c4ggu,sbcoco,3,Sat Jul 4 18:55:34 2015 UTC,Donald Brown? Anyone? Bueller?
Chargers,3c4ggu,CuteWolves,3,Sat Jul 4 18:14:56 2015 UTC,I just didn't see God dammit Donald as having an impact on our game. Am I wrong?
Chargers,3c4ggu,trillinair,3,Sat Jul 4 18:56:07 2015 UTC,"He led the NFL 2 season ago in YPC as a Colt. I think he had a down year last season with us, but he could definitely return to form with our improved OL. Maybe."
Chargers,3c4ggu,sbcoco,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:34:31 2015 UTC,I'm thinking he will make the team but not get many carries unless there are injuries. His teammates think of him as an afterthought to the rest of the RB's.
Chargers,3c4ggu,Duffman5755,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:44:12 2015 UTC,I think he will make the team. Chargers have carried four RBs for the past few season. I'm hopeful Brown had a down year last season
Chargers,3c4ggu,Green89,2,Sat Jul 4 22:09:09 2015 UTC,"You see it a little similar to me.  Basically MGIII is going to get the ball and he's going to get it a lot...  We've built this team to be a run first, dominating, ball control offense, and thats how McCoy was brought up as an OC under John Fox.  Because of that we're going to use a stable of RB's.  MGIII will be the premier, ""do it all"" back, and will probably have 1000+ yards (really not overly hard to do in the NFL anymore if you're a true #1).  the 2nd and 3rd back jobs are more titles than anything.  We're going to have packages for each.  Woodhead and Oliver are probably going to have very different roles, and will do different things for this team.  We all know Woodhead, he's a extremely good pass catcher, and just a tough guy, thats willing to step up in pass pro and fight for extra yards vs DB's and LB's in space.  He'll be the obvious passing down option.  Oliver is a little different, but he's a pretty good compliment to MGIII.  He's not a bruiser, or a scat back, but he falls somewhere in between.  He's only 5'7"" or so, but 210 ish, so he's REALLY thick and powerful.  He's really hard to tackle in the hole because of how low he gets (see the TD vs the Jets this year).  He's an extremely poor mans MJD.  He's going to get used a lot in shorter yardage packages and just to spell MGIII when he needs a break.  You saw it last year, he's so freakishly good at making a man miss in the hole, a huge reason for his success last year at times, our blocking was so bad that he was the only one that could really do anything, other than a game or two where Mathews showed his talent.  He's much more of a true RB than Woodhead, so he's probably going to be the ""backup"" that'll step in if MGIII is out for some reason in normal downs.  Am I really the only one not ready to give up on Donald Butler after a year with one of the worst (read: Most injured) OL's i've ever seen.  Our entire interior OL was completely demolished by all of the C's we lost and having to essentially bring guys in off the street and start them.  He's always been the type of runner that, if he gets the blocking, he's going to get you the yards you need.  He's not flashy, you won't see him breaking off 30+ yard runs consistently, but he's a guy that will put his nose down, hit a hole, and get you 4-5 yards, if nothing else, with good vision and anticipation.  I don't think he's going to be anything special, but I think he ends up being a guy who can be a solid role player and get 5-10ish good touches a game."
Chargers,3c4ggu,bdubbz14,2,Sat Jul 4 21:14:13 2015 UTC,"Every article I see basically has Gordon as the #1 back with Oliver as the change of pace back and Woodhead pretty much exclusively as a 3rd down back.  I think Woodhead will have a much bigger role in the run game than people think. I could see like a 60/20/20 situation where Gordon gets 60% of the carries and Oliver and Woodhead get 20% each. Donald Brown can just, like, block. Just not for Scifres. Or Rivers."
Chargers,3c4ggu,sneakAstroke,2,Sat Jul 4 22:30:24 2015 UTC,"MG3 = Two down back, Woodhead as the passing down back and on 3 and 4, Oliver as the short yardage specialist and goal line carry (our Mike Tolbert).  Donald Brown can collect dust on the shelf."
Chargers,3c4ggu,MyWifesABobcat,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:42:02 2015 UTC,I don't think Oliver is faster than Gordon though...
Chargers,3c4ggu,BobTaco,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:45:20 2015 UTC,"He is smaller and faster so he could fill a role similar to Darren Sproles.   He's certainly shorter but his weight/height ratio is wayyy more. Oliver is 208/5'8"" while Gordon is 215/6'1"".  Sproles is only 190/5'6"".  Oliver is pretty much the opposite of a sproles type back, and is almost certainly not faster than Melvin Gordon. Gordon's official 40 time is a full 0.1 seconds faster than Olivers (4.52 vs 4.62). At worst, they're the same speed but Oliver has much worse vision and is more of a bruiser back."
Chargers,3c4ggu,rindidumplin,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:42:35 2015 UTC,Donald Brown will be there for injuries...otherwise he's a waterboy. I expected him to be dumped in June...yet he's still here for some reason.

Chargers,3c1bim,tstscavo,5,Fri Jul 3 21:17:24 2015 UTC,"Just a couple of notes....Tourek Williams should NOT start.  We have Jerry Attaochu, who we spent a 2nd on last year will start at ROLB and Ingram will likely play LOLB.  That said We're supposedly moving towards more of a Seahawks-like base 4-3 Under, with a ""Leo"" or whatever you want to call that standup 9T position, there's a trilliion names for it, and a SOLB thats sort of between a 4-3 Sam and a 3-4 Sam, which is absolutely perfect for Ingram when he's healthy.  The other thing I'd add is that there's no guarantee that Fluker is going to move to OG, but it's going to be a battle for who's starting where on the right side.  There's even a chance for Hairston to win one of those positions, as he was drafted by Joe D in Buffalo and played well under him for a few years.  We signed Jacoby Jones specifically to take over KR and PR duties. Because of that I'd say its unlikely Chris Davis makes the roster, and Ducre does, but thats just my own guess.  There's a ton of backups that we have that can be really solid contributers.  Ryan Carruthers, LaDarius Green, Chris Hairston, Any one of our 4 RB's, whoever our 3rd ILB is be it Perryman, or Butler/Te'o, Jimmy Wilson, Tourek Williams in terms of Setting the edge and Ricardo Matthews.  Carruthers was very good in the playtime he got, great 1T/0T Nose candidate, him and Lissemore make a good compliment to each other at NT.  I think this is the biggest thing that's improved since last year, guys who were starting games last year are now backups for us, and we lost almost nobody, and the few that we did, we very arguably upgraded at."

Former Falcons defensive coordinator from 2012 to 2014, Nolan led the Falcons to the 5th best defense in the league in 2012 and a 13-3 record with the #1 seed in the NFC. The next years, however, the defense was ranked 27th, then 27th again last year. With the firing of Mike Smith also came the departure of Mike Nolan. The Chargers were ranked 13th in total defense last year, but ranked 26th in rushing defense. With 17 years as a defensive coordinator and 4 years as a head coach, Mike Nolan will be able to help the likes of Donald Butler and Manti Te’o.  Grade: B  Chris Shula - Defensive Quality Control Coach  A collegiate coach since 2010, most recently at John Carroll University, he is the grandson of Don Shula, the NFL's all-time winningest coach.

This was an open sign that things were coming to an end. Jarret Johnson saw significant time last year, playing 556 snaps, with a -.3 rating(PFF). Now, Chris Watt and the duo of Manti Te'o and maybe Ka'vell Connor will get more snaps this year Dwight Freeney  Dwight Freeney is a real head scratcher for me. I do think maybe that since the Chargers have a lot of young talent, they want to give these players as much of an opportunity to strive and grow. However, Freeney had the 4 highest rank on the SD defense in 2014, with 4.8. Either way, no other team has signed him yet, which could be telling. And again, Donald Butler and Manti Te'o will need to prove themselves this year without Freeney. Eddie Royal  I really like Eddie. So maybe i am a little biased. But i would have tried to keep him. He had a solid year, with 778 yards and seven touchdowns on 62 receptions. I still think of his productive rookie year with Denver. Hindsight is 20/20, so maybe this was a good move to let him go.   Players signed    Player Position Team Length Salary    Austin Pettis WR St. Louis 1 $745,000   Jacoby Jones WR Baltimore 2 $5,500,000   Orlando Franklin LG Denver 5 $35,500,000   Jimmy Wilson DB Miani 2 $4,250,000   Stevie Johnson WR San Francisco 3 $10,500,000   Mitch Unrein DL Denver 2 $1,900,000   Patrick Robinson CB New Orleans 1 $2,000,000   Kind Dunlap LT San Diego 4 $28,000,000   Brandon Flowers CB San Diego 4 $36,400,000   Trevor Robinson C San Diego 2 $1,700,000   Ricardo Matthews DE San Diego 1 $920,000   Corey Liuget DE San Diego 5 $51,250,000     Orlando Franklin  This was a much needed addition to an O-Line that struggled last year to keep a block. All of San Diego's offensive lineman combined for a PFF overall rating of -82.1, while Franklin had a rating of 16.4. Will be an immediate starter. Stevie Johnson  This is why i don't feel it is such a big deal that the Chargers lost Eddie Royal. While Eddie had more yards and touchdowns last season, he also had almost double the targets that Johnson had. Also, Johnson has had 3 1,000 yard seasons, while Eddie has none. The contract also was a lot cheaper than Eddie Royals. So they ended up with a player that is arguably better with a cheaper contract. The Re-Signings   In total, the Chargers re-signed 5 players. Brandon Flowers was a must sign, being one of the Top 15-10 Corner backs in the league. King Dunlap was also important because of the fact that San Diego's O-line struggled last year. Corey Liuget played alright last year. IMO, the contract was a little large. But considering who he is, a productive front 7 guy on a team with not a lot of front 7 talent, it seemed necessary . Ricardo Matthews played well in his limited time last season, and Trevor Robinson was much needed depth at the Center position.     Round Number Player Position School Grade    1 15 Melvin Gordon RB Wisconsin A   2 48 Denzel Perryman ILB Miami B+   3 83 Craig Mager CB Texas St. B-   5 153 Kyle Emanuel OLB North Dakota St. B-   6 192 Darius Philon DT Arkansas B-     I liked the Gordon pick. Gordon showed that he can play with his 4 year stay at Wisconsin. His senior year was his best, with 2587 rushing yards. He has a running style like Jaamal Charles, but looks like he has the speed of Chris Johnson. While not as fast, he has the ability to cut on a dime at any time and not lose speed. Is he worth moving up 2 spots, a 4th and a future 5th? Time will tell, but if the O-line does not improve(which i think it will), this could have a chance to be an ineffective pick. Denzel Perryman is very explosive player. He makes so many big hits. Can shred blockers well. A problem is he is a liability in man coverage, but he can cover a zone well. That has the opportunity to be taught by the coaching staff. Probably going to start on ST, but if Te'o or Butler struggle, dont be surprised to see him in a lot of plays. Mager climbed up the boards very late in the process, maybe because of the small school. But, he is a very physical corner who plays bigger than his 5'11 frame. Can mirror a receiver well in man coverage. One problem is that he is so attracted to the football that he sometimes over jumps routes and gives up big plays. His play reminds me like William Gay. Very similar size. While from a rather small school, Emanuel knows how to win. North Dakota St. has won the National Championship 2 years in a row(not BCS). Solid player, probably a back up. Size seems to be an issue. I see Philon as a project. He comes at you hard, but if he gets stopped, he will be eaten up. Playing behind Liuget will be a good spot for him to be in. More strength could help him get to another level.   Other Offseason News that Affected the Team   San Diego's move to Los Angeles  You know the deal. San Diego could be moving to Los Angeles as early as next season. Along with the Raiders and the Rams, these teams are in the running for the ""LA Sweepstakes"". I honestly don't want any team to move to LA, but i don't have the choice Eric Weddle  He isn't happy with his current contract situation, and he feels disrespected by the organization. Personally, i would do whatever that guy wanted to do if i was the Chargers. He has been and is the best defensive player on the Chargers and one of the Top 3 safetys in the league. Would not be surprised if he was gone after this season."
Chargers,3c1bim,scrambles57,4,Fri Jul 3 21:17:35 2015 UTC,"Projected Starting Lineup   QB: Philip Rivers - No question here. If the Chargers want to make the playoffs, they need a consistent year from Rivers with not as many interceptions. RB1: Melvin Gordon - I fully expect Gordon to start. If he gets above 1,000 yards, i consider the season a success RB2: Branden Oliver - Even though Danny Woodhead is in the equation, i like the way Oliver played last year. Woodhead is also injury prone TE1: Antonio Gates - No questions here, still has 2-3 more good seasons in him TE2: Ladarius Green - I want him to step up this year. I want him to have more targets, which could be possible considering an aging Gates WR1: Keenan Allen - No question here, but after his ""Sophomore Slump"", he needs to be the guy that goes over. WR2: Malcom Floyd - Last year in the NFL. If he can put up the numbers he did last year, that should be good enough to be successful   WR3: Stevie Johnson - He has the ability to have an 1,000 yard season, but i dont think they nned that from him LT: King Dunlap - Played well, keep up the good work LG: Orlando Franklin - Played great in Denver last year, just keep it up C: Chris Watt - Really needs to step up this year now that he will be the ultimate starter RG: DJ Fluker - There was word that they would be moving Fluker to Guard to help out the line. If this happens, i believe that it will significantly help the line RT: Joe Barksdale - Moving Fluker to guard can help bring in a veteran in Barksdale where the Chargers are weak at LE: Kendall Reyes - Ugh. I'm hopeful for Reyes, but i see this being the weakest spot on the D. Maybe we can see more of Ricardo Matthews this season? If Reyes struggles, i don't know if the Chargers re-sign him. DT: Corey Liuget - No Question. Think he can get a little better with his run defense NT: Sean Lissemore - Very average player, nobody else behind him really. Played ok last year, expect him to improve  ROLB: Melvin Ingram - Ingram would be a pretty good player if it weren't for injuries. Only played 9 games last year, ended up with 4 sacks. The success of this defense will depend on the play of the front 7. If Ingram can stay healthy, i can see a big year.  WILB: Manti Te'o - Another player that was injured last season. He ultimately missed 6 games, starting week 4. Like i said, he will have a major impact on how this defense plays SILB: Donald Butler - After a big contract year, Butler disappointed with a very mediocre season at best and ended the season with an injury. After a couple offseason surgeries, Butler is hoping to bounce back. I think he can do it. With new LB coach Mike Nolan, i feel ALL of these LBs can step up. LOLB: Tourek Williams - After improving on his 1st season last year, i think we see him here. If his play dips, however, we could see some Jeremiah Attaochu. CB1: Brandon Flowers - No Question. Great Cornerback. Keep playing at a high level. CB2: Jason Verett - Watched some game tape because i really wanted to see how Verett played in his limited time of play because of injury. He played pretty well. This secondary is pretty good i think. CB3: Patrick Robinson - Ok slot Corner, terrible outside Corner. I dont think he will need to play outside, so he can find his place in the Slot. FS: Jahleel Addae - Replacing Gilchrist, Addae will need to step his pass coverage up. Think he plays better than Gilchrist SS: Eric Weddle - No Question. Elite. P: Mike Scifres - Pretty Good Punter K: Nick Novak - Missed 4 field goals last year, but pretty solid otherwise. KR: Chris Davis PR: Keenan Allen - I know, having your #1 WR returning punts can be scary, but the upside is high.   Position Group Strengths and Weaknesses    Position Group Strengths Weaknesses    QBs Philip Rivers is an amazing QB who can make the best out of any situation Throws too many interceptions   Backfield Melvin Gordon is coming off a amazing college year. Have 2 solid RBs behind him Gordon is unproven, Olive is average and Woodhead is injury prone   Pass Catchers Besides Keenan and Ladarius, mature, seasoned veterans who have been succesful in this league. All can go long. Veterans can run out of gas   Offensive Line The Left Side The Right Side   Defensive Line Corey Liuget Everyone else   Linebackers Still young and unproven Many are injury prone   Secondary Pretty good in coverage Can't always save the Front 7 from messing up, weak at run blocking   Special Teams Pretty good punting team, on both sides of the ball PENALTIES. -15.5 PFF Grade for ST    Schedule Prediction    Week Matchup My Prediction r/NFL's Prediction     1 Vs.Detriot Loss 52% Loss   2 @Cincinnati Loss 56% Win   3 @Minnesota Loss 56% Win   4 Vs.Cleveland Win 87% Win   5 Vs.Pittsburgh Loss 58% Loss   6 @Green Bay Loss 88% Loss   7 Vs.Oakland Win 77% Win   8 @Baltimore Loss 67% Loss   9 Vs.Chicago Win 77% Win   10 Bye ..................... .....................   11 Vs.Kansas City Win 55% Win   12 @Jacksonville Win 79% Win   13 Vs.Denver Win 60% Loss   14 @Kansas City Loss 60% Loss   15 Vs.Miami Win 60% Win   16 @Oakland Win 64% Win   17 @Denver Loss 71% Loss   Final  8-8 9-7"
Chargers,3c1bim,toekneebalogna,4,Fri Jul 3 21:17:59 2015 UTC,"The starting OLBs will probably be Ingram and Attaochu. Also Jacoby Jones at KR/PR, most likely. Woodhead is RB2, no question."

Chargers,3bwqvn,LukeNeverShaves,6,Thu Jul 2 20:03:25 2015 UTC,"I know everyone in here has on the homer glasses. But let's be real here. There has never been a football player who has said that it wasn't just a ""supplement"" with an unknown banned substance. Look at the banned substance list and there really isn't any supplements out there that are on that list. He has team doctors who would be guiding him every step of the way and recommending the most optimal supps. This was steroids and I think everyone in here is secretly thinking it but no one wants to admit it."
Chargers,3bwqvn,skippy2893,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:20:21 2015 UTC,"It was a supplement that included the banned substance in it. There are way to many supplements and some only list the top 5-10 ingredients very easy for something to be excluded. I think a LB with the Colts had a similar issue where he was on a fertility drug that had a banned substance in it and God flagged and suspended for it. Not every player digs deep into the product or has the team doctors and NFL dig into it. Shit happens, he owned up that he should have been more cautious and is going to take his punishment."
Chargers,3bwqvn,LukeNeverShaves,0,Fri Jul 3 00:53:25 2015 UTC,"My point is that it is literally the only answer you will hear from players who tested positive when they speak to media. It used to be ""Yeah it was adderall"", but now since that's considered substance abuse rather than PED, they go with the ""Yeah it was just a preworkout that had something in it that I didn't know"".  We know it's not a stimulant since that falls under substance abuse and since stims are basically all that is in supplements that would be on the banned list, it's just really not believable. He can say it's something he didn't know, but you can buy ""test boosters"" that say they have steroid saponins in them but they never ever ever test positive.  To test positive, he would need to be taking legit Steroids/PCT/HGH/Insulin/AI/screening deterrent, since that is basically all that is included in the banned substance list.  And I don't know if you know this, but the reason Mathis was suspended was because he was using chlomid.  Chlomid is what you use to cycle off of steroids and put your hormones back to their natural levels. It's basically equivalent to being caught on the steroids and there isn't a single player in the NFL who doesn't know that and claiming ignorance is just a blatant lie.    TLDR: Players used to be able to say ""I took adderall"", but since it was re-categorized they now have to say ""I didn't know what was in my N.O.Xplode"" because they aren't going to say ""I was cycling Tren and Test but didn't get off in time""."
Chargers,3bwqvn,skippy2893,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:59:31 2015 UTC,"Or maybe since this is the first time in 12 seasons he has had a problem he actually didn't know there was a substance. Again it doesn't matter at this point. He is suspended for 4 games and that's the end of it. Some, like me, will take his word and others wont."
Chargers,3bwqvn,MikeMcNorv,0,Fri Jul 3 04:13:16 2015 UTC,"Well maybe since he's tested positive twice there is more to it than simply not knowing. They only get suspensions and fines on the second positive. They test positive once and then begin the frequent testing program. So going by that, I would assume he would have plenty of time to pick up his bottle of supplements and walk to the garbage can and then proceed to place it in there. Then I'm sure he would have plenty of time to ask his team doctor about the next batch of supplements since he knows he will be tested again. But yeah, it's all up in the air. For all we know Gates could have severe brain damage. I for one think it's more plausible that he is taking Mexican ""supplements"" so that he can prolong his career rather than being an absolute moron who is too lazy to check ingredients since he has already failed a test prior to this."
Chargers,3bwqvn,bubbavic,5,Fri Jul 3 04:30:40 2015 UTC,the good news is that Ladarius will finally get his shot.. and Gates will have fresh legs for the rest of the season.
Chargers,3bwqvn,sdsupersean,7,Fri Jul 3 04:36:32 2015 UTC,Always classy even when something like this hits him. Is there a chance he can appeal for a lower suspension?
Chargers,3bwqvn,PencilFaceButt,6,Thu Jul 2 20:16:47 2015 UTC,He admitted guilt. 4 games.
Chargers,3bwqvn,crimsontideftw24,2,Thu Jul 2 20:12:55 2015 UTC,"Rivers, Gates, Floyd, Woodhead, LT (back then), Hardwick, O'Neal, Volek, etc...we've been blessed with some of the classiest guys in the NFL.  I'm sure I've missed some.  But maybe that's why we never win the whole enchilada.  Other teams and players are finding ways to subvert the rules for fame and fortune.  And I guess, sometimes it works."

Plus, Green will get his chance to shine in a starting role, or at least prove to us that he can't so we can draft Gates' replacement next draft. Rivers will need to have a rapport with his other targets like Allen, Johnson, Woodhead, and Green early in the season as well, which will pay dividends down the road when good teams like the Broncos choose to lock down Gates in clutch time."

People act like NFL players are just super gifted which is why they can heal from injuries so quickly when the reality is that they use HGH to help the healing process. The NFL wants players to be bigger faster and stronger so that they can have the most freakish athletes but they're suspending people for trying to become bigger faster and stronger smh. Test every single NFL player right now and about 80% of the league gets suspended, this is ridiculous."

This means that he has tested positive twice so it's really not the same. I agree with you on everything about the league testing for something they know everyone is on, but it's not like they don't have warnings. The league even says ""hey guys, we will begin ""random"" testing in 30 days"" which is basically ""hey you have 30 days to get clean for the tests because we don't want to suspend you""."

He's just going to take the punishment because he should have been more thorough. Whether he knew about the substance or not it's his responsibility for what goes into his body.
Chargers,3bwqvn,Kalima,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:17:41 2015 UTC,"The league only releases positive drug test info after the appeals process. So if Gates appealed then he already lost. Once you hear about a suspension, it's a done deal even if he still doesn't admit guilt."

Chargers,3bwqvn,gochargersgo,2,Thu Jul 2 23:05:52 2015 UTC,"Thinking optimistically. This could possibly be a blessing in disguise. With the 4 games that Gates is out we will finally get to see Ladarius Green in full action. Considering this is the last year of his contract, I feel this is important if we are to dub him the TE of the future. In addition, although Gates has never had a decrease in numbers as the season wore on, he is getting older and he did ask to get a reduction in playing time(not sure if this was actually a false report, I forget the whole story). So this way Gates only has to play in 12 games and could possibly be able to go harder and might have a chip on his shoulder. Overall though this is a big blow to the team though losing someone like Gates for 4 weeks. It will be interesting to see who steps up and hopefully young guys like Allen, Gordon or Green are there to do so."

Chargers,3bxrl7,BoltingUpSince91,2,Fri Jul 3 03:56:43 2015 UTC,"Our defense needs some toughness and attitude. Perryman reminds me of Jon Beason, another Hurricane hitman in the middle who didn't have great size or speed but simply knew how to lay the wood.   Beason was neck and neck with Patrick Willis as the most fearsome linebacker in the NFL for a few years before he got slowed by injuries. I have high hopes that Perryman can have a similar impact. But we need our defensive linemen to eat up blockers. We know Liuget can do his job. Gotta root for Carraethers, Mathews and Philon to overachieve.   If our front 7 can stop the run and get some pressure, we might have a good team this year. I'm not worried about the offense now that the line has been solidified."

I wouldn't call them ugly though. Just unimaginative and the powder blue could be interpreted as wimpy. I like them nonetheless because Navy blue is EVERYWHERE!! Same issue with the Padres.

Chargers,3bxg32,miketheblade,2,Fri Jul 3 09:31:36 2015 UTC,We always hear players who get popped for PEDs make the same claim. The problem is that they have to know better and get anything that they take approved by the team/league. Those supplements are not regulated so they could include anything. Obviously none of use are pro football players so we don't know the exact procedures involved but it would be nice if the NFL or NFLPA had a list of approved supplements that they had tested so the players don't have to take a chance and get busted.  Ultimately it is Gates' responsibility and I'm happy he owned up to the mistake but I'm disappointed.

Chargers,3bwuis,salad_dressing_dude,4,Thu Jul 2 20:28:27 2015 UTC,"Yup, good thing we did not trade him like a lot of people were yelling for. Maybe he steps up huge and gets a new contract."

Chargers,3bwuis,basedcharger,6,Thu Jul 2 21:28:38 2015 UTC,If he balls out in those four games I hope someone photo shops him in lantern corp attire.
Chargers,3bwuis,bubbavic,3,Thu Jul 2 23:16:37 2015 UTC,I hope so. I've been waiting for this guy to be given a real chance and to show up on field.
Chargers,3bwuis,aquinasbot,2,Thu Jul 2 22:11:04 2015 UTC,This is probably the best way for it to happen because now he has time to prep for it mentally. Now he KNOWS he will be starting out of the gate. No pun intended.
Chargers,3bwuis,TheRisingTide,7,Fri Jul 3 14:08:12 2015 UTC,"Fool a ton of people into taking him in their fantasy football drafts?  If anything, folks shouldn't automatically assume Green is going to step right in and match Gates' 2015 production. What they should assume is that, with some fairly middling passing options, the team moves to a run first attack.  Basically, buy stock in Woodhead and even Gordon benefitting from Gates being caught cheating, not Green.  EDIT: Also, don't be surprised if the team signs a TE or two at some point before week 1 and that guy lines up to ""start"" at TE. Expect the team to heavily feature the running game (McCoy's strength as a coordinator) this year."
Chargers,3bwuis,TheRisingTide,-6,Thu Jul 2 20:28:55 2015 UTC,"If you like throwing away money, feel free to place a bet on Green coming even close to 50% of those extrapolated projections.   You can't turn a good slice of pizza into a good pizza pie by stretching out the slice into the size of a pie."
Chargers,3bwuis,theoriginalfathead,2,Thu Jul 2 21:49:03 2015 UTC,"You can't argue with this stupid. He just starts rambling about his own asinine assumptions about everything you say and builds an argument off those assumptions, thus arguing something that is completely irrelevant to your original post."
Chargers,3bwuis,TheRisingTide,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:50:48 2015 UTC,But the problem is that you're looking at the total position. You would need to analyse it and see how many yds he got when he was on the field without gates to get a truer reflection of his work.   If its a two te set he'll be the lesser targeted player from the defences point of view as the defence would always roll coverage to gates because he's so dangerous.   Greens problem now is can he step into gates shoes as the #1 option and nobody can make a judgement on that because he's never done it before for a large enough sample size.
Chargers,3bwuis,TheRisingTide,-2,Thu Jul 2 21:59:10 2015 UTC,"Your projections are based on assuming a coaching staff that went from semi-properly using Green in 2013 to all but forgetting about him in 2014 (coinciding with Wisenhunt being replaced by a rookie OC) will use him EXACTLY the same amount they used their HOF veteran level player at the same position, and you have the gall to critique me?"
Chargers,3bwuis,highastronaut,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:32:30 2015 UTC,"Again, assuming he's going to get even close to the number of snaps he'd need to put up those numbers is looking at Green in an unrealistic void. He's not Gates 2.0, the OC has no idea how to use him, and the team has enough weapons (or believes they have better weapons) to focus on using over trying to fit Green into Gates' role."
Chargers,3bwuis,TheRisingTide,3,Fri Jul 3 09:22:11 2015 UTC,I hate seeing this downvoted. I feel like a lot of posters in this sub don't really understand  football. It's always blind optimism and then when something goes wrong or they lose they freak out. Look how the team handled losing Mathews and Woodhead last year.
Chargers,3bwuis,Chargersbreh,2,Thu Jul 2 22:03:28 2015 UTC,"Probably shift toward 3-4 WR, additional blocker, blocking TE sets, emphasize the run game a whole lot more (to the tune of well over 60/40 of all offensive plays). I wouldn't be surprised to see Jacoby Jones wind up with more snaps than Green, to be honest."
Chargers,3bwuis,highastronaut,0,Thu Jul 2 22:31:04 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be surprised to see Jacoby Jones wind up with more snaps than Green, to be honest.   I will bet you a lifetime ban from /r/Chargers Green has more snaps than JJ after 4 games."
Chargers,3bwuis,Chargersbreh,2,Thu Jul 2 22:34:05 2015 UTC,That isn't what he is saying at all. Having a less talented tight end will definitely affect the play call. Reich has proven to be conservative in playcalling and the play call will probably change because he clearly doesn't trust Green like he trusts Gate. That is why Green hasn't been featured as much. If the coaching staff knew he could come in and change games....they'd put him in a lot more. They aren't stupid.
Chargers,3bwuis,Chargersbreh,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:48:31 2015 UTC,"Well duh, if they trusted Green more than Gates, Green would be starting right? Of course hes not going to be featured like Gates. That is not the point of this thread."

Chargers,3bwuis,geeving,0,Thu Jul 2 22:34:46 2015 UTC,"In a perfect world, that would make sense but you can't just assume Ladarius is going to produce a similar number if he was given the same playing time as Gates. That's just not how it works in the real world. Too many variables and the sample size is inefficient to draw anything conclusive. Lot of teams actually locked down on Gates because they knew he is a threat and a clutch player. Ladarius didn't get the same treatment and attention, which he benefited from partially. And I think it's important to note that Ladarius had 0 TDs in 2014 while Gates had 12."
Chargers,3bwuis,trillinair,3,Thu Jul 2 22:37:25 2015 UTC,"I don't think we're expecting Gates type production. Green is more of a vertical threat anyway. I do think he'll be able to step up to help alleviate the loss of Gates on the field though.   No, he's not gates, but he's still a dangerous weapon at his size and speed, and I think he'll do well when his number gets called."
Chargers,3bwuis,TheRisingTide,2,Thu Jul 2 22:41:40 2015 UTC,"I don't think people are saying he is going to go out and be amazing, just that they are excited to see what he can do, due to his potential. I don't think they'll change up their entire game plan because of this."
Chargers,3bwuis,ChargersAndBeer,2,Thu Jul 2 22:43:31 2015 UTC,"I was too, then last year happened. There's no reason to think that Green, in this offense, is going to even come close to what Gates offers the offense, even at this stage of the latter's career. It's just ""well he kind of looks like Gates, and when we had a competent offensive coordinator we were able to exploit mismatches against him"". It's a huge leap of logic.  Basically, without saying it explicitly, a lot of people assuming Green will step into Gates' shoes without any problem at all. They're looking at it like swapping two similar pieces on a board when in reality there's far more likelihood that the team moves more of it's focus on the running game."
Chargers,3bwuis,TheRisingTide,3,Thu Jul 2 22:46:22 2015 UTC,Guess we all have to wait and see
Chargers,3bwuis,ChargersAndBeer,2,Fri Jul 3 19:17:43 2015 UTC,"We already knew the team was going to focus more on the run game, that's why the bolts moved up in round 1 even though we have 2 very capable backs and one Brown stain. I think folks are excited(myself included) to see what the young man can do with more snaps considering his production last year was limited because of Gates. He has great potential and now the opportunity to show his value."

Chargers,3bwuis,trillinair,-2,Fri Jul 3 08:21:43 2015 UTC,"Don't play dumb, hyping up Green due to Gates being busted for PED essentially means seeing something in him comparable to Gates on the field. Otherwise, the thread would be called ""Well, Gates is gone, maybe we can figure out a way to make up for him being off the field?""."
Chargers,3bwuis,TheRisingTide,2,Thu Jul 2 21:11:59 2015 UTC,"I think people expect him to play very well, I doubt there are many Charger fans who expect him to match a future HOFer."

Chargers,3bwuis,madmelonxtra,2,Thu Jul 2 21:04:30 2015 UTC,"Well I expect him to play very well compared to his previous production. I expect him to be at least a league average TE with upside going forward. I agree people have lofty expectations, but it's not crazy to think he could play above average with the starting spot.  We will be run focused, that opens up play action plays like TE seam routes."

Chargers,3bwuis,TheRisingTide,0,Fri Jul 3 07:25:00 2015 UTC,"Green wont get close to Gate production because he only has 4 games to do it. Obviously no one is saying he is better than Gates. I am trying to find a point in most of your posts, but its hard. What are you saying? Green sucks?"
Chargers,3bwuis,Chargersbreh,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:08:15 2015 UTC,"We have great depth at T.E, I highly doubt we burn money on a stand in starter or even long term unless they really don't like what they are seeing from everyone in the off season."
Chargers,3bwuis,dinosbucket,0,Thu Jul 2 21:10:56 2015 UTC,"Woodhead and even Gordon benefitting from Gates being caught cheating, not Green.   How does going from the bench and getting 5-6 snaps to being the starting TE not benefit Green?   Fool a ton of people into taking him in their fantasy football drafts?   You do not play fantasy do you?   the team moves to a run first attack.   We are already planned as a run first anyways."
Chargers,3bwuis,Pseudoing,3,Thu Jul 2 22:15:28 2015 UTC,"Green was the talk of the fantasy football community last offseason as a massive sleeper, don't play stupid.  Also, him being ""named"" the starting TE doesn't necessarily mean he'll see the field a significant number of snaps (or be involved in the passing attack). Just like how Lissemore is the starting NT but sees the field less than a third of all defensive snaps at that position.  Plus, it's way too early to presume Green will be the starter. Would not surprise me to see John Phillips wind up starting at TE. The team has made completely batshit stupid decisions before (like last year's bizarre RG rotation)."
Chargers,3bwuis,dinosbucket,5,Thu Jul 2 22:27:57 2015 UTC,So then go in the Fantasyfootball sub reddit and bitch about it. Why the fuck are you in here?

This is how I see it playing out, based only on my opinion:  LA decision is delayed another year. It gives all three cities time and breathing room to negotiate with their teams. It's particularly nasty right now because of the tight time frames and the amount of pressure on both sides, and the fans are being used as cannon fodder, which sucks for us but is strategic nonetheless.  The league will meet and decide to move forward with the Inglewood site. Given their history in LA compared to the Chargers,  as well as the ability to retain current team divisions/conferences, the league approves the Rams and Raiders for relocation. Either through causation or good faith, the Chargers and city begin to work together on a stadium effort.  It's hard to see the business end of it right now, and trust me I hate Fabiani as much as the next fan, but he is getting paid to be a No man because, tactically, that makes absolute sense. To agree, praise or concede gives up a huge bargaining position for them, and they are sticking to their strategy. But if/when the city and team meet and develop a mutually embraced plan (which I truly believe is possible) Fabiani, or at least his attitude, will be gone.  I've run the gamut of emotions through this whole thing, but now more than ever I am convinced that this shit show of a parade is just that, and we really will get what we want.  Of course, that's just, like, my opinion, man."

Chargers,3bwc0i,blzd4dyz,2,Thu Jul 2 22:32:10 2015 UTC,"I'm holding out hope that you're right.  Of the three cities, St. Louis has had by far the most litigation. The Inglewood stadium is also the easiest to get built. The Rams also have a nice history in LA. For those reasons, I think the Rams are the most likely team to move.  Oakland has the most desperate stadium situation, probably the worst deal put forward by their hometown, and also has an established LA fanbase. So if a second team were to move, I think it would be the Raiders.  Despite the Chargers' objections, a new San Diego Stadium probably has the best chance of being built. It's unlikely to be subject to the kinds of litigation we see in St Louis, and financially is not a terrible deal for anyone involved. The Chargers would be the minority team in LA if they were to go there with anyone else.  The prospect of a hometown team leaving is always a depressing business, but I'm trying not to despair too much."

But he's a business man and the Chargers are a business. Being grounded to an abysmal quality stadium is costing his business money. It'd be flat out stupid to stick around if it looks like nothing is going to change and there's better money elsewhere.
Chargers,3bwc0i,Beginning_End,2,Thu Jul 2 19:41:26 2015 UTC,The issue is SD is trying now and nothing is being reciprocated. So the situation could in fact change if they gave a damn.
Chargers,3bwc0i,BobTaco,2,Thu Jul 2 19:48:45 2015 UTC,"Two points.   For 15 years the city wasn't just non-participatory, it was obstructionist.   How long were the Chargers supposed to wait while getting rebuffed at every turn?  Which lead in to:  This is all just business. Billion dollar negotiations are rarely friendly, this one is just more public to us. It seems pretty clear that without a legitimate threat, San Diego politicians were going to continue to sit on their hands. The Chargers finally making overt gestures towards leaving appears to be the only thing that would work.   This is not to say that the Spanos's are saints. They're businessmen that have had to finally play hardball to get results."
Chargers,3bwc0i,Beginning_End,2,Thu Jul 2 19:59:38 2015 UTC,"One point.   When the Chargers first approached the city about a new stadium, it was half a second after the city emerged on the other side of the ""Enron by the Sea"" pension scandal.  The city hadn't even had time to catch its breath.  Bad timing on the Spanos' part.   Now that the city is in better financial shape and has a pro-stadium mayor, the issue is being addressed, but the Chargers are crying ""too little, too late"".  So yes, this is a business decision for the Chargers, but you also have to take the context into account."

Chargers,3byw8d,NightClerk,5,Fri Jul 3 15:50:19 2015 UTC,"Raiders do indeed have promising players and some vets to mentor them but unless some divine intervention occurs, I think the Raiders are going to more or less the same because   1) The Raiders coaching staff do not know how to utilize their players to the fullest. Our team last year was practically held together by duct tape yet still managed to take on the younger healthier Raiders.  2) Derek Carr had a good season last year but at the same time no one had a high expectation out of him either and the sophomore slump is coming up. Since we have some footage of Carr, surely the upcoming season will be a bit more challenging for him.  3) The Raiders do not have a standout player that can carry the team. Their players definitely have potential but, at the current moment, a lot of players in that team still has a question mark in terms of how much they can affect the game.  4) Old habits die hard and Raiders are going to Raider in the Raiderest way possible.    5) Fuck the Raiders"

There is only one direction they can go from there: up. That said, they were a complete dumpster fire last season. It is very unlikely they will be able to recover from that in a single season. But since Al Davis died...they have been actually drafting properly...so who the heck knows.  Be afraid of the entire division though. They are all built for upsets..as usual."

Chargers,3btdgy,deserthiker762,7,Thu Jul 2 00:04:17 2015 UTC,"here's the thing. $100 bucks for the game jersey isn't worth it. $250 for the elite definitely isn't worth it. The only Nike jersey that has a reasonable price is the limited ones, $150 is a pretty good deal for those imo. Great stitching, and even the Chargers name on the chest is stitched. But I recently bought a Jason Verrett jersey for Aliexpress for 20 bucks and it was a complete steal. But after that I ordered a Weddle jersey and it was pretty trash, so you just have to get lucky with Aliexpress. But it beats being ripped off by Nike."
Chargers,3btdgy,MikeMcNorv,4,Thu Jul 2 00:08:41 2015 UTC,"I agree. Nike's price point is way off on their jerseys. I got the Navy $100 one as a gift from someone so I can't complain. Though, I definitely prefer the stitching over the screen printed numbers."

Chargers,3btdgy,chronicwisdom,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:01:49 2015 UTC,I've found with Aliexpress that you have to find a reputable seller who posts pictures of their own jerseys. Lots of the sellers just steal the picture from the NFL/Nike site and I assume those are the worst. I got a Gates and two Rivers last year from different sellers and all three look pretty great.

It was really good quality, and from what I can see they have Chargers: Rivers & Te'o jerseys.

If you have no issue paying $150+ for a Jersey than its definitely a better looking jersey, I for one have legit Jersey for each team and a handful of knockoffs because they're cheap and I like the variation for different players"

I read through the best and worst of the draft recap you wrote up and my one complaint is that you really gotta do more editing of the articles before posting them. I get that you're saying the Panthers draft was a reach, but saying it was ""one, big, reach"" isn't how you would punctuate that. There are just a ton of grammatical issues throughout an otherwise entertaining article. I'm totally being a stickler about it and I get that, but it's pretty important if you're trying to keep the quality of the articles and website in general high."

No loyalty to the team. Just selfish. The owners don't want San Diego and yet the fans are begging them to stay. Why? So they can pay to see opposing teams. Yup it's opposing teams fans who want this team to stay.

Chargers,3bnk94,throwawayfashizzle,3,Tue Jun 30 17:29:26 2015 UTC,Any of the open practices are fine really. The ones at Chargers Park tend to have fewer people...especially the mid-week. Fanfest tends to have a crapload of people in comparison.

Chargers,3bnk94,BobTaco,6,Tue Jun 30 17:57:20 2015 UTC,"Not all practices are open to the public. Of all the 10 open practices, only fanfest is at the Q. The rest is at Chargers Park. Link  It is first come first serve. They have a designated section for people to sit and watch (on some bleachers behind a fence). They will have people there to make sure you don't take a wrong turn somewhere. It can get confusing to park at Chargers Park. It will be inevitable that you will be on the street somewhere. Could have to walk a 1/4 mile or more to get to the Park. Make sure you follow the parking rules on the street...while cops tend to be slacky on the rules because of the massive crowed, they could still hand out tickets, especially for redzone/fire hydrant situations.  Where sunscreen. There is literally zero shade anywhere."

Chargers,3bk1fo,Marthalameu,5,Mon Jun 29 21:20:31 2015 UTC,"You're right about both places; there's free parking and places to eat.   Hazard Center is a smallish shopping center. I hated parking there. It was crammed to me. I think they've got a Joe's Crab Shack.   Fashion Valley is a proper mall, so plenty of parking. They've got the food court which is meh, but there's also Cheesecake Factory and PF Chang's.  ETA: There's also the Mission Valley stop. Again, free parking and places to eat. They've got more places to eat at the mall and surrounding areas than the other two stations, but if you don't want to walk all over the place, then you'll wanna drive to where you want to eat (In the mall: Outback, Tilted Kilt, Ruby's and food court. Surrounding areas: In-n-Out, On the Border, Gordon Biersch, Buffalo Wild Wings, Hooters, and more) and then drive over to the little shopping area across the street north of the mall to where the station is."
Chargers,3bk1fo,ace-destrier,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:50:10 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thanks for the quick response.   Would you happen to know or remember if in each location there was specifically marked parking spots for people leaving their car and taking the trolley, or if it's just one big parking lot and it doesn't matter where or how long you park?"
Chargers,3bk1fo,ace-destrier,3,Mon Jun 29 21:58:39 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure at Fashion Valley and Mission Valley you can park wherever you want for however long you want. Someone put me in check if I'm wrong.  And actually, you know what, I'm gonna just go ahead and advise against parking at Hazard Center. 1) Lame places to eat. 2) After the game, by the time you get to your car, it'll be after 10pm. All 3 locations have movie theaters, so there will still be cars in the parking lots/garages, but Hazard Center is really small relative to Fashion Valley and Mission Valley. I'd be most concerned about leaving my car there.  With Mission Valley, like I mentioned, loads of places to eat, but if you want your car amongst other cars at night, you'll want to park in the mall parking garage. The station, though, is amongst a small strip of stores across the street from the mall. On foot, it's a little ways away.  This leaves Fashion Valley as probably the safest place to park. Everything's contained in the Fashion Valley area. Park near the trolley station and then just walk the length of the mall to the food court or Cheesecake Factory. Or vice versa, park near the movie theater/food court area and walk the length of the mall to the trolley stop.  TL; DR - All 3 have movie theaters, so pretty much park wherever for however long you want. Fashion Valley >> Mission Valley >>>>> Hazard Center"

Chargers,3bk1fo,Orgasmo3000,2,Mon Jun 29 23:53:55 2015 UTC,"One last question.. some people on Yelp said you could park in the parking structure and its connected to the trolley stop - is that true? If not, the corner lot right next to the station looks like it has a lot of parking - I wouldn't have a problem leaving my car there till 10 or 11?"
Chargers,3bk1fo,secretcode,2,Tue Jun 30 01:21:40 2015 UTC,"The trolley station is elevated. There's a walkway that connects to the parking structure. Can't remember what floor. The open parking lot is ground level. Just a set of stairs to get there.  There should be people from the game (don't know how many) who'll park in that area too; the lot and/or the nearby structure. You shouldn't have a problem. If you get worried about it, I'd say head to the east-ish side of the mall where the movie theater/food court/CPK is and park in that parking structure."
Chargers,3bk1fo,JennerUntucked,2,Tue Jun 30 02:41:41 2015 UTC,Gotcha. Thanks again.
Chargers,3bk1fo,JennerUntucked,2,Tue Jun 30 03:01:36 2015 UTC,"Gotta agree with /u/ace-destrier's rankings.  Comparing Hazard Center to Fashion Valley is like comparing a Mini to a Lexus -- they'll both work in a pinch, but one will be a whole lot better than the other in terms of parking capacity and choice of eateries."
Chargers,3bj7yx,ace-destrier,3,Mon Jun 29 17:50:29 2015 UTC,"Excerpt:    The team isn't totally at fault, however. A national recession and a city-wide pension crisis put several earlier plans on hold, according to U-T San Diego. And San Diego has had seven different mayors since 2003, all with their own agenda and plans for how to handle the local NFL team.  “When you dig a little deeper, you see there’s a lot of reasons why things didn’t work out the last 12 years,” Tony Manolatos, spokesman for Mayor Kevin Faulconer’s stadium task force, told U-T San Diego. “No one was out to get the Chargers and it’s not impossible to build a stadium in San Diego. The Chargers were victims of bad timing.”   This argument serves both sides. Timing was shitty for everyone. There was a lack of continuity in city leadership, which can't be blamed on the city government as a whole, but on the shitty people who were supposed to lead it.  Then, the only reasonable window of time in which a stadium deal could've been made and construction started was early on in Jerry Sanders's time as mayor, but then not long after, there was a global recession.  So until and since then, there wasn't an appropriate time to sit down and get something done, but now there is."

Chargers,3bj6j3,ace-destrier,7,Mon Jun 29 17:40:21 2015 UTC,"This is a terrible article.  First, Emanuel isn't even close to on the bubble.  We have a complete lack of depth at OLB, Emanuel is as close to a lock to make the roster as any of our other backups, because he's a second stringer right now...  Second I don't think there's any chance that Hairston doesn't make the roster.  He and Barksdale aren't competeing for a backup spot, one of Fluke/Bark/Hairston will get kicked inside to play OG (where all except Fluker have played before), one will start at RT, and theother will be the ""swing"" tackle.  Our second best option behind one of them at ""swing tackle"" are the random UDFA's like Forrestal Hickman.  The only thing I do like about this article is the mention of Greg Ducre as one of the last men out.  I think he's a serious contender for Chris Davis' spot.  He's far more athletic, and now that we aren't in desperate need or return men Davis isn't nearly as valuable.  If I were to do this, it'd probably be something like this.  Last 5 In:  Dontrell Inman  Brian Parker (I think he's a sneaky pick for a roster spot, really athletic, big TE who is a perfect developmental guy)  Colton Underwood (I touched on the complete and utter lack of OLB depth earlier, he's got high upside, tested really well)  Greg Ducre  Curtis Grant (Him and Parker are my super under the radar UDFA guys.  He could be a really nice pet project for Mike Nolan, he's got great athleticism and can fill downhill well)  Last 5 Out:  Chris Davis  Titus Davis/Tyrell Williams (I think the better one of the two in the preseason ends up on the PS)  Jeremiah Sirles  John Phillips  Cordarro Law (I haven't really seen much potential in him TBH. The team is obsessed with Tourek and likes him, so I think we could see Law get the boot if we only carry 4 or 5 OLB's with Underwood in)"

Chargers,3bdg12,fl1ntfl0ssy,3,Sun Jun 28 04:22:08 2015 UTC,"Nobody knows yet. There's a meeting August 11th where they'll most likely decide when owners can start applying for relocation. I haven't heard any estimates on when this will be, but I would guess around October plus or minus a month.   The other question is how long it'll take once the applications get submitted for the NFL to decide what they want to do. Again I haven't seen anything on this, but my guess is that the Raiders, Chargers, and Rams will all apply as soon as it opens, and they'll have a series of meetings to negotiate, which will take a couple weeks."
Chargers,3bdg12,ajswdf,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:43:46 2015 UTC,"Teams can't apply for relocation until Jan 2016.  The Aug. 11 meeting is just to update owners on the L.A. situation, and October is a regularly-scheduled meeting."

Being realistic, I think the Chargers are staying even though they clearly want to leave. At this point it is a given that the Rams leave and I think the city of Oakland just can't find a legitimate plan to keep the raiders so really there is nowhere the chargers can go and they already said it is LA or crawling back to San Diego."

Chargers,3bdg12,FelipeFuckingRios,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:49:52 2015 UTC,"What if the owners swap teams. Mark Davis or Dean Spanos trade the Raiders or Chargers for the Rams and some serious dough. Kroenke comes in and builds his stadium, and moves one of those teams (NFL won't likely object to movement by either Raiders/Chargers like they would with the Rams)."
Chargers,3bdg12,Pittyswains,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:53:33 2015 UTC,Rams are leaving because St. Louis is a small market just like SD. Everyone's vying for LA because it will automatically give a huge boost in value to whoever goes. St. Louis would prob make the Chargers lose value.

Chargers,3bdg12,FelipeFuckingRios,0,Sun Jun 28 18:46:50 2015 UTC,It's a lot of things.  The Rams owner is building a stadium in Inglewood. That site can basically brake ground today if they want. That means Carson is out. If the owner of the Rams is building a stadium...the Rams would be the most obvious candidate for the move. Plus they have a fanbase in LA.
Chargers,3bdg12,BobTaco,0,Sun Jun 28 16:59:55 2015 UTC,"The Rams owner is building a stadium in Inglewood.   Well, that would do it, yeah"

Chargers,3bdg12,Dudecalion,0,Sun Jun 28 17:31:08 2015 UTC,SL could also build a stadium reguardless and end up with the Raiders. I'd be ok with that because it would mess with rivals.
Chargers,3bdg12,BobTaco,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:40:52 2015 UTC,"No date has been announced because there isn't one yet. However, it will be before the end of the season, because Inglewood will be ready to dig in December."

Only 2 teams in southern california and rams stay in STL. That way Kroenke can move without fighting the NFL tooth and nail. Chargers may or may not join the raiders in inglewood.  Edit: Change of ownership."

Offense vs. Defense, I believe they go 11 on 11. It's a good chance to see the stadium too if you don't go regularly. Hotdogs are like a dollar a pop too. You can get autographs too depending on where you sit. Just sit near the rails and the players will come to you after they're done practicing. All in all, I really enjoy it, I don't live in SD so I can't make it to Chargers park to watch them, Fan Fest does it for me."

Brown would appear to be solidly 4th on the depth chart according to Williams. UDFAs Dreamius Smith and Jahwan Edwards are ""on the bubble,"" but considering their position I think that's a polite way of saying one of them will be lucky to make the practice squad.  Of interest regarding Gordon:   Gordon will be used on early downs but has proved a better pass catcher than expected, and he will be used in the passing game.    This seems to back up Kyle Posey's assessment to not question his abilities as a receiver."

Chargers,3b50hs,PencilFaceButt,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:40:44 2015 UTC,"It's quite possible that he knows and doesn't care. He gets to look like a big shot, having dealings with the NFL. In competition with his city is an Inglewood plan that is further along, and the city of San Diego trying to keep the Chargers. So when a stadium doesn't get built, he can spin it as an unfortunate outcome, and it didn't result as any fault of his own.  I think all Carson has committed to is starting to ready the landfill site for development. So when they don't build a stadium they just switch to a strip mall or something. Best case scenario, Carson has an NFL team and a stadium. Worst case scenario, they do what they were going to anyway, but again he got to raise his profile by dealing with the NFL.  And don't forget about claims of corruption in Carson. I have to wonder about what kind of kickbacks city officials have received. I image at the least he's had some very nice dinners paid for by Fabiani, who then billed Spanos for it."

Chargers,3b50hs,ace-destrier,7,Fri Jun 26 03:18:52 2015 UTC,I love the whole citizens initiative to bypass the EIR happened in Inglewood and Carson (which the Chargers helped with) but didn't for the City of San Diego. And it was the stadium task force's and the Mayor's fault for wasting time. Dean and Mark Fabiani are a real smart bunch.
Chargers,3b50hs,Chargers388,6,Fri Jun 26 01:43:14 2015 UTC,"What I don't get is why, even if we had all the signatures we needed today to bypass an EIR (an EIR that Assembly Speaker Toni Atkins says she can exempt us from), would take until May for the City Council to vote on it, according to Fabiani. That can't be right."
Chargers,3b50hs,Orgasmo3000,5,Fri Jun 26 04:44:05 2015 UTC,"Yea and Carson and  Inglewood got a proper timeline...because it was in the works while SD was recalling a Mayer...  That's why they did it in 2 months, but SD can't according to Fabiani."
Chargers,3b50hs,BobTaco,6,Fri Jun 26 02:36:05 2015 UTC,"I like how SD has made legit progress in the short time they have had, and yet they've done nothing according to Fabiani. And Fabiani keeps bringing up old situations that aren't even in play atm.  I want to hear from an expert in EIRs. Can they actually be reduced because it's a stadium being built on a stadium? Because I'm tired of one side saying no, and the other saying yes...and they are supposedly basing this on the same people/information.  And to say Carson and Inglewood don't need EIRs is rediculous. That is one of the biggest loopholes I've ever seen. It is literally saying it's OK to ignore regulations (that prevent injuries and health problems as well as other possible issues) because the uneducated public voted on the initiative. The general public doesn't know all the safety regulations. It is the job of the damn elected officials (who are sopposedly well versed on these sorts of things) to do do what is in the best interest of the public. This includes keeping them safe...which includes doing studies to make sure proposed projects don't fuck everything up for the people in the area.  This system is screwed up. What's the fucking point of laws if the general population have to abide by it, but nobody else does?!"

Chargers,3b50hs,Chargers388,2,Fri Jun 26 00:49:32 2015 UTC,also Fuck Fabiani!!
Chargers,3b50hs,ajswdf,2,Fri Jun 26 02:02:30 2015 UTC,"What the heck are they doing? If they are serious about Carson, why would they allow this mess to happen? If it's just bullshit to gain leverage in San Diego, why are they torpedoing negotiations there? It looks like they're just shitting on everybody with no end game."
Chargers,3b50hs,BJEdwards,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:13:25 2015 UTC,"Carson serves as leverage against both San Diego and the NFL/Kroenke. The threat of Carson finally kicked San Diego into high gear on the stadium issue. My impression though, is they would much rather prefer a downtown stadium over the current location which would require more time to figure out, or at least want more time to get better assurances for the current location. However, if the NFL goes by Kroenke's timeline, that time doesn't exist before the Chargers' LA threat goes away.  Carson provides an alternative plan to the NFL, and as long as they have another option, it makes a delay more reasonable. I think it doesn't even need to be that viable, as I'm sure some owners welcome it as a chance to keep Kroenke in check. I don't think the NFL cares about what happened at this town hall meeting, as the Carson plan has already been pitched to the NFL officials that matter by Carmen Policy. I doubt they care that a presentation wasn't given to the public."
Chargers,3b50hs,ajswdf,2,Fri Jun 26 18:23:26 2015 UTC,"I think the Carson plan is dying, and the Chargers are going to start shifting to using Inglewood as leverage (assuming they want to stay, they might just move to Inglewood if they want LA bad enough) while the Raiders will use San Antonio and St. Louis for leverage. Carson has served it's leverage purpose.  However, now that you point it out, it makes more sense if the point of Carson was for leverage against Kroenke, not San Diego. The Chargers have done everything in their power to sabotage any stadium plan in San Diego, so if they move in with Kroenke they need to convince him and the NFL to give them a generous lease."
Chargers,3b50hs,BJEdwards,2,Fri Jun 26 18:30:40 2015 UTC,"the Chargers are going to start shifting to using Inglewood as leverage   What interests me is how that could play out. I've been thinking the NFL could just approve Kroenke's plan, and then have just the Rams play in a temporary location. It will still take some time to get built, which the other teams could use to figure out their home stadium situation or move to Inglewood once it's finished. That makes more money for the league than having two teams having to play in temporary stadiums, due to seating capacity and whatnot, and allows the league more time to take advantage of other cities. And it keep Kroenke happy because he gets to spend some time as the only team in LA."
Chargers,3b50hs,ajswdf,2,Fri Jun 26 20:04:36 2015 UTC,The issue with that is the NFL wants two teams to move at the same time if they both move. Any second team would have a severe disadvantage in terms of getting fan support.
Chargers,3b50hs,PsychicWarElephant,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:12:39 2015 UTC,please don't be naive and think the Chargers want to stay in SD.

Chargers,3b50hs,PapaRomeoDelta,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:23:24 2015 UTC,"I heard that interview.  Up until this interview I only surmised that they were lying.  Now, I know for sure...about 95%.  I feel like I can start enjoying football again and get to know the players instead of a trumped up story."
Chargers,3b5w7t,BoltB11,3,Fri Jun 26 05:49:01 2015 UTC,"Supposedly they can't because of the amount of time needed to do it. But, if the Chargers gave SD the same amount of time as Carson...they could have. But they didn't. And they wanted SD to do a vote anyway...and agreeded they should...so no shit there isn't enough time now.   Just like Fabiani complains that they shouldn't have spent time making the taskforce...and should have started the EIR then...even though the Chargers wanted downtown and that couldn't be done (according to the taskforce) due to the time constraints put on by the Chargers. So a location wasn't even decided on until later...and you can't do an EIR without knowing the location the project is going on.  This thing is so damn rigged against the city of SD it's not even funny. Told to do A...get criticized for not doing B. Lol"
Chargers,3b5w7t,BobTaco,1 point,Fri Jun 26 06:59:17 2015 UTC,"What I don't get is that getting signatures would, indirectly, be a referendum on the stadium issue. Your vote is your signature. If you want to vote for a stadium, sign the initiative; if you don't want to, don't sign.   In that sense, there would have been a vote. But to spend 5 months on CSAG and then not do an initiative, after the Mission Valley site had been chosen makes no logical sense, because now you have a location, you have permission, and you have the money, but you don't have the time to execute the plan. The initiative could have been a backup plan.   Notice that the Chargers didn't says they didn't approve of the CSAG framework, just that they didn't think there would be time to execute it."
Chargers,3b5w7t,Orgasmo3000,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:40:10 2015 UTC,"You can't have an initiative without working out the details like location, payment method, etc. That was what the CASG was for. They could figure out that stuff faster and more efficiently than not using a task force. And according to the Fabiani, if an initiative started today, it wouldn't get done until next April (10 months). This started in late December, so if an initiative started then, it would be done in October. But because you need some details worked out first it would most likely start a month or two later...so it would be done in December.  It's basically the same timeframe. The only difference is that an EIR is needed. Based off of what an EIR looks at, there are some studies that wouldn't need to be done (traffic, noise/light polution) because that is going to be the same because a stadium is already there. The issue is IDK how much time that will actually save. BUT, if the city's timeline is correct, it's virtually going to take the same amount of time as an initiative. AND it wouldn't exploit a completely bullshit loophole in an environmental law. And with or without an EIR, there will be just as many lawsuits slowing stuff done. Both are probably just as ironclad....assuming the EIR isn't completely bullshitted."
Chargers,3b5w7t,BobTaco,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:29:31 2015 UTC,"According to Fabiani (so consider the source), even if we had all the signatures today, we wouldn't be able to get a city council vote on the matter before May at the earliest.   I call bullshit you on that estimate."

Chargers,3b1s7k,NFirst,11,Thu Jun 25 07:26:24 2015 UTC,"I'm from Canada so I follow the league, and if you're interested in following teams with NFL ties, then there's plenty.  Toronto had Both Inman and Law  The Lions were Cam Wake's team  The Roughriders were Jurrel Freeman's team  Duron Carter (Chris Carter's son now on the Colts) played for the Allouettes  Brandon Browner played for years with the Stampeders  Also Chad Johnson is currently with the Allouettes.  If you have any other questions with the CFL I'd be happy to answer"
Chargers,3b1s7k,Jdittmer9,3,Thu Jun 25 16:44:52 2015 UTC,Cool thanks. What's the biggest difference that sets it apart from the NFL? Besides the skill level.
Chargers,3b1s7k,Jdittmer9,6,Thu Jun 25 16:52:04 2015 UTC,"A few things. First, there's only three downs so passing is huge. Second, the field is much larger so throws to the sideline take much longer to get there. Also players with good speed and open field ability will thrive. Third, there's 12 players on the field instead of 11. Also recievers are allowed to run toward the line of scrimmage before the snap. These recievers will usually line up inside the wideout and are called ""slotbacks""."
Chargers,3b1s7k,Ninjygingy,2,Thu Jun 25 16:59:14 2015 UTC,"Also on defense there are ""half back"" who are in between the corner and the outside linebackers who keeps contain on outside runs and will normally cover the flats"
Chargers,3b1s7k,Jdittmer9,2,Thu Jun 25 18:09:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, their roles very much like a nickel corner and have impact in stopping the run as well."
Chargers,3b1s7k,deathrabbit,2,Thu Jun 25 18:13:03 2015 UTC,The CFL also doesn't allow defensive players to line up within 1-yard of the line of scrimmage.  Plus the Rouge and 1-point plays are huge in CFL... makes for some crazy special teams plays
Chargers,3b1s7k,dunkster91,3,Thu Jun 25 19:06:01 2015 UTC,"Also to comment on skill level, many of the top draft picks in the CFL (coveted for their Canadian heritage, which is required in at least 21/46 of your gameday roster) fail to garner interest, let alone be drafted or kept on a team in the NFL.    I'm sure some of that is attributable to coming out of university, being fresh, different rules in the NFL vs Canadian Interuniversity Sport, and perhaps other reasons, but most stay in the CFL and don't translate."
Chargers,3b1s7k,Jdittmer9,2,Thu Jun 25 17:22:37 2015 UTC,"True, the CFL ""draft"" is kinda a joke. Teams like to use their linemen to fill up the necessary Canadian roster spots."
Chargers,3b1s7k,UHRossy,0,Thu Jun 25 18:14:00 2015 UTC,Huh. That 21/46 rule is pretty funny. Also seems like it could severely limit the sport tbh.
Chargers,3b1s7k,dunkster91,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:01:28 2015 UTC,"Standard Canadian content regulation.  Almost everything that is broadcast in Canada, television or radio, has a quota of ""Canadian content"" that it has to distribute.  Keeping a rule like this in the CFL means that the CFL qualifies as ""Canadian"" thus allowing broadcasters to count it toward their overall quota."

Chargers,3b1s7k,BobTaco,10,Mon Jun 29 00:51:21 2015 UTC,Haven't got the slightest idea about any of their teams right now. But your idea about following the team where Inman came from seems like a good start. Also Doug Flutie played for Toronto and won back to back Grey Cups with them. Can't go wrong with where Flutie played.
Chargers,3b1s7k,Frightenstein,6,Thu Jun 25 09:24:24 2015 UTC,"That's the type of answer I was looking for, thanks mate."
Chargers,3b1s7k,Ninjygingy,2,Thu Jun 25 09:37:41 2015 UTC,Bah! Toronto fans don't even care for their team much. Flute played for the Calgary Stampeders for a number of years and won a championship there. After Flutie went to T.O. Jeff Garcia led the Stampeders to a Grey Cup win. After Garcia left for the 49ers Dave Dickinson became the Stampeders QB before heading to the Chargers. I'm actually more of a Saskatchewan Roughriders fan.
Chargers,3b1s7k,MyWifesABobcat,3,Thu Jun 25 23:09:17 2015 UTC,Flutie also played for the stampeders!

Chargers,3b1s7k,GSkillz,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:24:31 2015 UTC,can't be worse than when they were the Rough Riders. Of course at the same time there was another team called the Roughriders...
Chargers,3b1s7k,canuckschargers,3,Thu Jun 25 19:42:13 2015 UTC,"I tried this a few years ago. Picked Hamilton as my team, read up on the players, whoohoo ti-cats. Ultimately though, I couldn't get excited about it. CFL is cool, but it's not an NFL substitute for someone with life-long team fanship. I wasn't sure who to hate or why."
Chargers,3b1s7k,TClarke91,2,Thu Jun 25 19:24:49 2015 UTC,"As a Canadian I'm gonna warn you now: I love the CFL because I am at risk of being deported if I don't, but the skill level is nowhere close to the NFL. Honestly, most SEC teams could probably beat up on a CFL team.  I cheer for the Lions though, as a BC boy. If you wanna watch a team win, go for Calgary. Best QB and RB in the league right now."
Chargers,3b1s7k,desertrat113,2,Fri Jun 26 02:52:41 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the CFL is an absolute hoot. I don't think any of us think it's a replacement for the NFL. It's just fun to watch wacky local football in the summer."

Chargers,3b0ytr,Dudecalion,36,Thu Jun 25 02:21:21 2015 UTC,"If this does become feasible though, and is built, could we then rename the river, Philip river?"

And it's cool that she brought up how parkland could be paid for, but that doesn't address the stadium cost. Ideally, yes, the site would be beautiful with those things she mentioned but just how practical is it? The news calls it a proposal but it's really just a few ideas from someone with some experience. How would we know the details without a full proposal like the one the city is already running with?"
Chargers,3b0ytr,toekneebalogna,9,Thu Jun 25 02:55:46 2015 UTC,I just can't get over the fact that she was so dead set against building a new stadium in Mission Valley but now that the alternative would be more condos she's changing her tune.
Chargers,3b0ytr,Orgasmo3000,8,Thu Jun 25 03:01:14 2015 UTC,"I'm all for her changing her tune. Let's face it: San Diego needs a stadium bigger than Petco Park for concerts,  sporting events, etc. It brings in the dollars.   I like the idea of the river park a lot, because it will attract tourism, and will be sold to San Diegans and the rest of the country as a river park, NOT  ""a new Chargers stadium"". That's a big part of why this current stadium is such an uphill battle.    People need to realize that a new stadium would be so much more than just a new home for the Chargers."
Chargers,3b0ytr,PsychicWarElephant,5,Thu Jun 25 07:40:35 2015 UTC,There's nothing profitable about a stadium. We will never recoup the money because most of the money spent there is going to already be spent in some form in the city anyway. I am all in on a stadium but the idea that it's somehow going to be profitable is wrong. They literally never are.
Chargers,3b0ytr,MuaddibMcFly,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:02:05 2015 UTC,I don't know about never...  but there's still no reason to believe that this would be the 1:100 that breaks even...
Chargers,3b0ytr,Orgasmo3000,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:41:40 2015 UTC,"Stadiums don't bring in the money, but tourism does.  If the stadium just happens to be next to a tourist attraction, so be it. Even better."
Chargers,3b0ytr,Beginning_End,1 point,Fri Jun 26 05:11:23 2015 UTC,Donna Frye has been pushing this pet project of a park and such in mission valley forever now. She was one of the primary obstacles of the Chargers developing a new stadium in that area back when they actually had private investors interested...and what was her reason for not wanting to part with the land? Building parks and shit. Who knows where the money to build and maintain those parks was going to come from. It's hilarious that now she's trying to tack her pipedream on to the Chargers.   I really can't stand that woman...
Chargers,3b0ytr,SwillFish,0,Thu Jun 25 16:37:56 2015 UTC,"If you're in real estate development, mitigation fees can be one of your biggest expenses. Either you have to set some of your own land aside for environmental purposes or you have to buy land nearby to be set aside for environmental purposes. It's important not only for the environment but because if you don't do it, San Diego would end up looking more like LA than the way it looks now with its canyons and green belts that divide communities. Anyway, Fry's point is, why not surround a new Qualcomm stadium with parks and wetlands instead of high density condos and strip malls if the cost to do so can be paid by developers? I'm not sure if as much money could be raised selling land for mitigation purposes instead of development, but it certainly is something worth exploring. For one thing, the City could sell mitigation land in the river basin that is otherwise unsuitable for development, so there might actually be a lot more land to sell if it was all set aside for mitigation.  Also, the City is now trying to extend/connect a continuous park belt along the entire waterfront stretching through Point Loma/Mission Beach all the way south of Downtown and beyond. The San Diego river basin connects to this zone and is a natural corridor to extend new parklands eastward as well. It would be great if there is an economically feasible way to include a new Qualcomm in this long term plan even if it costs the City a little more to do so. It also gives something substantial to those who are otherwise opposed to a stadium deal."
Chargers,3b0ytr,BobTaco,10,Thu Jun 25 13:06:17 2015 UTC,Donna Fry is also made of leather...and is kinda bad at her job.
Chargers,3b0ytr,rayray21,6,Thu Jun 25 04:02:38 2015 UTC,"Donna Fry????  Is this not the woman that gave up any negotiating leverage the city may have had years ago by completely refusing to even talk to the Chargers about he possibility of a new stadium?  Don't even, Donna Fry.  Her ""hard line"" stance on everything is why the Chargers are in the position they are in now - the position of power.  Donna basically spelled it out years ago that she wouldn't help them with a new stadium.  And now she's reversed course and has some grand idea?"
Chargers,3b0ytr,Beginning_End,3,Thu Jun 25 14:34:36 2015 UTC,I'm really glad other people remember this.   The people who demonize solely the Chargers with all this stadium drama annoy the shit out of me because they seem to completely ignore the bullshit people like Donna Frye pulled that pretty much nuked the original and viable plans the Chargers had when they also had private investors interested.
Chargers,3b0ytr,Crestylia,2,Thu Jun 25 16:44:32 2015 UTC,"viable plans the Chargers had when they also had private investors interested.   Name them. There were NEVER any investors. Scott Lewis debunked the notion that the Chargers had anyone interested in the Mission Valley real estate a long time ago.   Donna Frye was the only council member to vote against the pension 'reforms' that destroyed San Diego's finances. It was those 'Enron by the Sea' pension reforms that have prevented our streets being repaired, caused our libraries to be closed, prevented our infrastructures from being repaired. And finally prevented any relaisistic chance of a Stadium being built.   Donna Frye was the only person that knew the City couldn't afford a port-a-potty nevermind a Stadium.    Talk about rewriting history."

Sorry, I don't recall off the top of my head the name of some investment group from literally 10 years ago.   Donna Frye was the one proposing building a park instead of a stadium in mission valley...you bringing up her knowledge of our financial situation was exactly why it was so frustrating.

Donna Frye was the only voice of sanity at city hall. As the mayor and other council members were signing up to pension reform she was screaming that it was all based on pie in the sky bullshit.

In particular the promises made in late 90s and then in 2002 basically bankrupt the city.   It is the lack of money in San Diego since then that directly has affected all stadium related discussions. The Chargers potentially leaving all stems from the pension fiasco and the political fall out.
Chargers,3b0ytr,Beginning_End,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:12:37 2015 UTC,"It also has a lot to do with a completely hostile San Diego government that made it very clear they had no legitimate interest in negotiations of any sort.

Chargers,3b0ytr,Beginning_End,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:18:21 2015 UTC,"That article seems a bit revisionist to my memory.   As I recall it,  the Chargers would-be investors that just magically backed out did so because of a completely toxic and hostile city government that made it clear that they had no interest in giving up the Qualcomm land before discussion could even be had, and the primary voice in that hostility towards the idea was Donna Frye, who felt the city could get more out of the property by selling it, and that if the city were going to be doling out land, it should be to fund her moronic park idea that had absolutely no basis in reality."

Chargers,3b0rks,bdubbz14,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:52:45 2015 UTC,"Its really hard to say anything about last year's offensive lines.  If you want to compare our OL to what it was, look back to 2013.  We were a pretty solid unit.  Nothing special by any means, but a solid unit.  Last year we were so injured that it didn't matter.  In some cases we picked up a player one week, and within a week he was starting, with next to no knowledge of the playbook, and at C none-the-less, the position who has to make all the OL calls. We did this with 2 or 3 different guys last year.  If we actually had even a relatively healthy OL like we did last year, it would've been a pretty decent group, like it was 2 years ago. The additions of Franklin/Barksdale are very good ones.  The one that people don't know about was Chris Watt.  I think he's going to be really, really good.  He was dominant for most of the Baltimore and NE games.  One of the OL scouts I really trust (Duke Manyweather), and has great evaluations, loved Watt, thought he was going to be a pro-bowler."

Chargers,3b08m8,Lighterless,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:58:20 2015 UTC,He gets taken by the 5th round at the latest in an 8 team league. You might want to cruise over to /r/fantasyfootball.
Chargers,3b08m8,Aceoangels,1 point,Fri Jun 26 11:46:04 2015 UTC,Thus far he is the number 12-14 rb taken in mocks. 8x5 = 40 or so drafted RBs...the math is not for a Gordon waiver pickup haha
Chargers,3b08m8,Lighterless,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:34:58 2015 UTC,I felt like I was being generous too. I'm thinking after preseason he's a third round pick with plenty of people taking him late 2nd.
Chargers,3b08m8,Duffman5755,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:04:50 2015 UTC,"I think so.  Whether or not he has a good rookie year, he's going to get the ball, and get it a LOT, behind a offensive line built to run block.  This has less to do with Gordon, and more to do with what our FO and coaches have clearly decided this team is going to be, and on offense...that's a physical, ball control offense."

Chargers,3azmmo,bubbavic,2,Thu Jun 25 00:53:37 2015 UTC,I don't see why not.  LT would make  a great RB coach consultant.  It's the off season so players are allowed to train however they choose.  Wouldn't be too far fetched for Gordon himself to ask LT to run a couple of his workouts.
Chargers,3azmmo,froggy184,-13,Wed Jun 24 20:18:25 2015 UTC,LT can be a petty bitch at times.  Exhibit A) AFC Championship Game vs. the Pats.  He's too invested in his own legacy to risk developing a player with legitimate qualifications to eclipse him.

Chargers,3azmmo,PapaRomeoDelta,2,Wed Jun 24 22:13:31 2015 UTC,Undeveloped Poway lots can be fairly expensive (200k to under a million) and hard to develop but people love it because of its location. Jamul may be more in the 30k range but even then it may come with absolutely no utilities or paved road access.

Chargers,3avlas,opaque22,3,Tue Jun 23 21:40:03 2015 UTC,"I wouldnt say i drank the kool-aid but I was ok with us drafting him as he was a complete back. Everyone tries to say his catching was bad or whatever but I watched his tape and his pro day and he can catch, secure the ball and run up field like the best of them. Not to mention his vision and motor to get going and burn some defenders. We got a great RB, a healthy RB and a RB who wants to be here and compete in the form of Melvin Gordon."

Don't get me wrong here people I own a couple fakies as well (LT TCU and LT Pro Bowl) just offering tips to someone curious.  For starters the price, you will not get a ""real"" authentic jersey anywhere for 22 dollars, not even Jamarcus Russell.  The numbers are usually pretty shiny (although OP's doesn't look terrible, the powder blue around the numbers is a little too metallic)  Also the white doesn't look to bad around the bolts here is an example where the white appears to be that big.  As you can see the shoulder numbers overlap the white that we are talking about.  Overall I have never had any real issues from Ali, although a buddy of mine got a lynch jersey with the nameplate upside down but they sent a new one no problem. If you are going to go the fake route definitely use Ali"
Chargers,3au66j,hdcantona,2,Tue Jun 23 18:31:42 2015 UTC,"Usually it's how things like the numbers and names look on the jersey. If it is a slip of fabric sown onto the jersey, it's usually a fake because legit ones have each letter sown on individually. This is just what I've observed, not 100% sure. Probably the best way to figure it out is to just find pictures of fakes from sites like aliexpress and compare them to the real thing on Nike.com or NFL.com"
Chargers,3au66j,hdcantona,2,Tue Jun 23 17:35:47 2015 UTC,"White around the bolt is pretty big, the stitched on numbers on fakes tend to be more raised which you can kinda see, the numbers on her shoulders basically overlap the white on the shoulders because it's so big.

Chargers,3au66j,JOE619,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:37:22 2015 UTC,"What usually tips me off is the color of the powder blue (looks more turquoise here) and how bubbly the bolt on the shoulders look. But again for $20 you can't beat it, I've seen far worse fakes"

In essence, Steve asked Mark about the Raiders rep and Carmeb Policy not being in the townhall meeting and Mark said that it was a giving that they wouldn't be there and everyone knew about it prior.  Turns out Carson mayor Robles didn't know and his story was much different than Mark's. He gave his side of the story earlier in the day to Dave and Jeff. Steve told Mark such and all Mark could say is ""We need to communicate better with Mayor Robles.""    In other words, they had to get their stories straight.

Given his history I can see why they really just wanted him for interacting with the NFL and not the general public.  As for the Raiders, I haven't seen to much news on them and their search for a stadium. I've seen something about the A's not wanting to share or such, and that Davis is willing to sell a portion of the team for the rest of the funding needed for a stadium. But everything I've seen about Carson regarding the Raiders organization suggests they were a last minute addition to what is a Chargers project, and that clearly they aren't as invested in it."

Chargers,3ascsp,janky85,4,Tue Jun 23 06:04:29 2015 UTC,Possibly planned? Maybe the meeting was a scare tactic aimed at San Diego?
Chargers,3ascsp,ajswdf,6,Tue Jun 23 04:36:31 2015 UTC,"It is all a farce. It is smoke and mirrors to manipulate both the city of San Diego as well as the NFL. LA is the great bargaining chip with cities. If Kroenke moves the Rams to LA, then a lot of the urgency goes away, unless the Chargers want to use the threat of being Kroenke's tenant in LA. Carson put pressure on San Diego to kick into gear and work towards a solution, but it looks like more time is needed. Carson can also provide the time necessary, as it presents the NFL with an alternative to Kroenke's plan, and therefore a reason to possibly postpone a move decision. And I'm sure some owners in the NFL appreciate what the Chargers are doing, as it puts a little bit of a check on Kroenke, instead of allowing him to do whatever he wants.  At least, that is how I feel about it now. Maybe next week I think it is all a lost cause."

Chargers,3ascsp,dannymac1784,3,Tue Jun 23 13:33:36 2015 UTC,"The Mayor said Carson was following the Santa Clara Model, but they were getting things that Santa Clara wasn't getting.  As I understood it, per the Carson Mayor:   Carson isn't paying a dime of taxpayer money for the stadium. Goldman Sachs is picking up 100% of the tab. The same Goldman Sachs guy who handled the Santa Clara stadium will be overseeing the financing of the Carson stadium.  Carson isn't paying a dime of taxpayer money for maintenence of the stadium.  Carson is being 100% reimbursed for all stadium-related expenses, including the pizza available at last night's meeting. Chargers will be paying rent to Carson for use of the stadium (one of the things Carson is getting that Santa Clara didn't) Carson gets a share of the revenue from all non-NFL events that take place in the stadium.    That seems like a pretty sweet deal considering Carson is getting all the privileges with none of the expenses.   It also begs the question: How Is Goldman Sachs making any money on this deal? The only way I could see them making money is by charging the Chargers interest on the $1.7B loan."

Chargers,3asv8n,surfingNerd,5,Tue Jun 23 16:26:24 2015 UTC,"This is a very popular opinion and one that I have generally shared, but lately I'm starting to wonder about that.  Dean has not always been the most progressive guy in making assertive decisions on behalf of his franchise.  He let the Bobby Beathard-Bobby Ross feud drag on too long and then fired the wrong guy.  He let the AJ Smith-Marty Schottenheimer feud drag on too long, and some would say that he fired the wrong guy in that case too.  He let the AJ-Norv era drag on too long until the team was virtually depleted of talent.    How do we know that he is the guy calling all the shots?  Fabiani certainly could just be the public mouthpiece for Dean's words, but then why have a mouthpiece at all?  Simply because you are too cowardly to say your own words yourself?  That's an awfully expensive way to dodge heat from the fans and the media.  On the other hand, I would not be at all surprised if Dean hired Fabiani and said ""get me a new stadium deal"", and then left it up to Fabiani to chart the course to that objective.  When Dean hires a GM, he generally steps out of the way and lets the GM run the football side of things, which to be fair, a good owner should do.  However, it's a very different story when you are talking about issues like franchise relocation, stadium deals, etc.  Maybe Fabiani is the guy who is constantly in Dean's ear saying ""San Diego won't work, we need to go to LA"" and Dean is just too passive to disagree.  It wouldn't be the first time he stayed the course as the situation was obviously and noticeably deteriorating around him."
Chargers,3asv8n,fuckdirectv,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:13:00 2015 UTC,"Interesting as well that Dean is a longtime, very conservative Republican that consistently donates big dollars to political campaigns.

Chargers,3asv8n,froggy184,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:19:02 2015 UTC,"Yes, that is definitely odd, unless he simply thinks that Fabiani is the expert he needs to get a new stadium deal and he is willing to back Fabiani's strategies because he believes Fabiani knows how to play the game more than Dean does."
Chargers,3asv8n,fuckdirectv,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:35:57 2015 UTC,"On the other hand, I would not be at all surprised if Dean hired Fabiani and said ""get me a new stadium deal""   If you have enough $ for an NFL franchise, and a little extra, would you trust the majority of your net worth, to someone who manages disasters, get you the stadium?  don't think so. Your part of Dean supporting Faulkner, and now rallying against him, is interesting. When he got elected, I incorrectly assumed, he would roll over and give them a sweetheart deal."

You might, depending on your personality.  Keep in mind that Dean is not a self-made man.  He inherited the family business from his father.  Some billionaires are aggressive ""go-getters"" and some were just born with the right family name.  A lot of people feel that they are better off hiring subject matter experts that know more than they do about a particular topic and trusting those guys to do their jobs.  This is what Dean and most other owners do with their GMs, as opposed to a guy like Jerry Jones that wants to be in control of everything.  Dean has definitely exhibited those traits in the past to suggest that he is comfortable standing out of the way while someone he has hired formulates important strategies and makes tough calls.  Granted, the final decision on whether to move or not will still rest with Dean, but I absolutely believe that he could be ok with letting Fabiani figure out the road map that leads to that final decision point."

Chargers,3as75y,BJEdwards,6,Wed Jun 24 18:56:10 2015 UTC,"It is possible this is all going the best way it realistically can, as far as the Chargers both getting a new stadium and staying in San Diego. Carson is designed to both manipulate San Diego as well as the NFL. The threat of Carson kicked San Diego into high gear to find a solution, while this issue has dragged on for years.  Kroenke moving the Rams to LA removes the biggest bargaining chip, unless the Chargers want to threaten being his tenant, which isn't as palatable. So the Chargers need to stall for time. The city is saying a stadium can get built, but more time is needed for environmental stuff and the like, or to figure out how to actually make a downtown stadium/convention center expansion work. Carson provides the NFL an alternative to Kroenke's Inglewood, and therefore a reason to delay an LA move as options are further considered, and situations are allowed to develop.   And I'm sure other NFL owners would like to check Kroenke a bit, and not let him just do whatever he wants. The Carson plans apparently show a bunch of NFL network stuff. Maybe this is a way to get Kroenke to sweeten the pot and provide the NFL a bit more in exchange for letting him take LA.  So, the NFL having two allegedly viable plans in LA, as well as potential stadium offers in cities, is enough to give them pause, allowing enough time for San Diego to present a favorable plan to the Chargers."
Chargers,3as75y,PencilFaceButt,5,Tue Jun 23 06:47:37 2015 UTC,"You bring up some interesting points.  I've been looking at this under the assumption that it's the NFL, Rams, Raiders and Chargers vs. St. Louis, Oakland and San Diego.  Billionaires fighting over money is nothing new.  The Rams have an out.  If they a new stadium given to them in St. Louis, they can either build a stadium in L.A. anyways or projects in Inglewood.  Dean I think is acting at the behest of NFL and is being told, ""well, Kroenke is getting L.A. because he can build it.  But, we'll have him hold up the process and drag it along until until enough urgency is built up in S.D. so that you can get what you want.""  Regarding calling Goddell: am I the only that sees this as a plea from San Diego?  Doesn't this move lessen our ability to negotiate a fair deal for San Diego?  Or, is the end goal a stadium at any cost for most die hard Chargers fans?  Carson: 1. No email or letters of correspondence between the Chargers and Carson officials. 2. The land is an old waste dump.  Grading into the land will cause major health concerns which I think the Chargers and/or Carson may already know about. 3. Chargers/Raiders to Carson means Chargers are second fiddle.  Rams/Chargers to Inglewood means Chargers are second fiddle. 4. Major internal fighting between all Carson officials.  They look like the peanut gallery.  That or a Taiwanese congressional brawl. 5. Raiders have continuously not shown up to the meetings in Carson.  Maybe they can't afford the airfare from Oakland to Carson (that's how poor they are). 6. NPDES.  Look it up.  Goes into effect this next coming year with even bigger restrictions in terms of development regardless of the existing surface area type.  Mission Valley has a better plan because it gives some of that parking lot land back in the form of a park.  Carson is a dump.  Chargers say they have a new boyfriend (Carson) and that their new boyfriend will give them everything they want.  Carson is uglier, fatter, poorer, crazier and smells a lot more than San Diego.  Let her walk."
Chargers,3as75y,ajswdf,2,Tue Jun 23 16:16:56 2015 UTC,"But urgency is already built up in San Diego, what else can the city do other than negotiate with the Chargers? If the Chargers really want to stay in San Diego, now is the time to get a stadium done.  I'm not sure the NFL will delay Kroenke. They will continue to use LA as a bargaining chip for San Diego (since the Chargers will move in with him) while the Raiders have San Antonio and potentially St. Louis. Carson looks like it's about to die, so the NFL needs to plan for the next step in this stadium debate. If they delay Kroenke too much St. Louis might be able to get funding together and make things awkward. As it stands, these lawsuits simply won't be resolved this year, which gives the NFL an excuse to let the Rams leave."
Chargers,3as75y,fuckdirectv,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:54:48 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't count out an eventual result in which the Rams move to LA and the Jaguars move to St. Louis.  It doesn't get talked about much (at all?), but Jacksonville is a lousy market and the Jags have been doing poorly from a fan support/stadium perspective for years.  On top of that, their new owner is a St. Louis native.  If St. Louis can get a viable stadium proposal together and Kroenke still leaves, I could see them just shifting their focus to the Jags to fill that market."

Chargers,3ar9xs,creanium,7,Tue Jun 23 05:53:22 2015 UTC,"Glad you at least like some of the things we publish.  I'm one of the senior editors on the site, and I do some writing. I mostly will edit the articles for formatting and grammar/proofreading. I don't have a lot of say in the editorial direction of the site (though I will at least give John shit when the situation warrants).   John shoots from the hip in a lot of his writing. He has strong opinions (however loosely-held they are) and it comes across in his writing. It rubs many people the wrong way, and some of us writers and editors give him shit for it too.   Like it or not, in addition to the writing, John also put together the writing staff. So the writers that you do like are on staff because of John.   We all have opinions, and BFTB gives the writers on staff a chance to voice those opinions on a public platform. You're not supposed to agree with what's written all the time, and many times things are written to incite discussion (not in an inflammatory sense usually).  As with any group of writers, you're going to have favorites and also have those you don't like. You don't like John's writing, that's fine. He's just one of the writers on the site (who happens to also be the managing editor). When it comes to the other writers, they have nearly complete freedom on what they want to write, John doesn't set the editorial assignments to fit his vision or anything.  But, it's the offseason, there's only so much we can write about. It's been one of the shittier offseasons for Chargers fans. LA, Rivers, Weddle; difficult to write and read as Chargers fans but it's things we needed to cover as well. A lot of good has come out this year with the Flowers and Dunlap extensions, and some good pickups in free agency the draft. But the other storylines just won't go away (especially the LA situation, but the team wants that to stay on the forefront).   We're not going to write the fluff pieces that always come out during Training Camp about how Jeremiah Sirles really is solid competition to Orlando Franklin and just might unseat him. Or reading too much into who's playing with the first team and the second team.   I am not at all saying what we write is perfect or 100% the best out there, nor am I defending everything John writes. But a lot of times our ""fandom"" gets called into question because we can be negative. We honestly aren't being negative for negative's sake, the writers feel they're being what they view as ""realistic."" It comes across as negative to some people, and we get told we're ""not real fans.""   Setting aside how much I hate whenever someone tries to espouse what a ""true fan"" is, nothing could be further from the truth.  The reason it seems like we're never happy (especially in the offseason) is because we love this team so much and want to see it be the best team in the NFL. There are people on staff that look at how the team's built and think, ""good, but not good enough."" It doesn't come from a place of ""this team sucks I hate this team"" like many perceive, but from a ""we know you can do better"" and express those opinions.   I'm not here to change anyone's opinion, but at least offer up a behind-the-scenes take on all this."
Chargers,3ar9xs,Duffman5755,2,Tue Jun 23 14:31:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the inside look into it.  And you're absolutely right about Genaro, he did a very solid job putting together a staff and running the site in general.  Honestly though, he just comes off as incredibly childish to me.  He comes up with ideas, and if the chargers don't follow through with them, he throws these little bitch-fits on twitter from the BFTB account.  He's also super egotistic and he feels the need to call people out telling them how he's going to rub it in their face, and will not concede when he's definitely wrong.  Whenever the team does something it seems like he always had a better idea for a move.  Honestly, i'm not a fan of his writing, but I genuinely can't stand him on twitter, and he just comes off as a douche.  I think he does a great job managing the website and giving the writers freedom, i'll give him that.  I'll never question someones fandom, because honestly, I couldn't care less what level of a fan someone is of a certain team.  Especially in writers, I focus on how well they know the game, and writing style.  And obviously there's a need for some of those fluff pieces, i get it, you're in the offseason and still need to produce articles and everything, so I'm not as much worried about that aspect of it."
Chargers,3ar9xs,creanium,2,Tue Jun 23 15:48:36 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to disagree with your opinion because it's your opinion and you're entitled to it.  John's one of my best friends and I can tell you he's far from childish. The best way I could describe him is passionate.   When something gets under his skin, you know about it. When he gets excited about something, you know about it. When he's so sure about something, you  know about it.   I touched on above that John has strong opinions, loosely held. He'll be so sure about his opinion but he does have an open enough mind to be convinced otherwise. He'll be fiery and in your face about his opinion, and then the next day he's pulled a 180 and is now fiery for the opposite opinion because someone convinced him otherwise.   He's passionate and confident about everything and just a very excitable individual. That's going to rub many people the wrong way and I don't expect you (or anyone else here) to start liking him. But I just wanted to at least give some perspective on his personality."
Chargers,3ar9xs,john_gennaro,3,Tue Jun 23 16:33:13 2015 UTC,"Awww. How sweet!  Here's the truth, and nobody is going to like it:  When I post the shit-stirring posts, we get our highest traffic ever. When I go on childish Twitter tirades, we get hundreds of new followers. In both cases, my bosses (yes, BFTB has bosses) are happy.  BFTB is a bit of a passion project, and one that I continue doing despite working 50-60 hour weeks at my real job. Sometimes, and especially in the middle of the doldrums of the offseason, that means taking the easy traffic layup and making sure I don't get fired. Call it the Skip Bayless way of running a blog/twitter.  Also, creanium mentioned this, but I'll elaborate. I used to write a lot more. I used to write about everything. I used to write 4-5 posts a day. Now, as our staff has grown and we've added incredibly talented writers (like Kyle and Jeff), I spend a lot of my time offering them support and staying out of their way.   I'm not going to write an Xs and Os post to compete with Kyle's the same way I won't write a stadium post to compete with Jeff's and I won't write a power rankings post to compete with creanium, etc etc  In the end, I can take getting my name shit on every few months if it means that our site traffic is as high as ever (it is) and that our social media following continues to grow rapidly (it does), because I take a lot of pride in getting the great work our staff writers put out in front of the biggest audience possible."

But he constantly calls people out for how dumb their ideas are unnecessarily because they don't match up with his ideas/opinions and stuff like that.  He's very in your face about being right and tries to backtrack when he's wrong about something. To me it just comes off as childish, if nothing else, extremely egotistic.  I'm not going to pretend I know what he's like as a person, but that's just coming from what I've seen from him in his writing, but mostly the handling of the twitter account.  I still can't wait to see the backtracking he does if Fluker ends up starting at OT and Barksdale is the one to move to OG."
Chargers,3ar9xs,dinosbucket,2,Tue Jun 23 17:11:46 2015 UTC,"If that does come to fruition, you won't see backtracking, you'll see him doubling-down, yelling at the team because they aren't using their players to the best of their abilities.

Chargers,3ar9xs,boltfanindenver,2,Tue Jun 23 06:26:52 2015 UTC,I honestly haven't been following the minutiae of the Chargers as a team  until this move to LA business is settled.  If they move I won't be a fan anymore so until then I don't give a fuck what the Chargers are doing.  And I've been a season ticket holder and a diehard fan for a lot of years.
Chargers,3ar9xs,creanium,2,Tue Jun 23 04:36:39 2015 UTC,"The way I see it is that they're money during the season. During the offseason, they still post some stuff worth reading (draft & FA analysis (KP is the man), stadium issues, and some insider stuff), but they also start posting some articles perpetuating the rumors, which aren't worth reading.   For the most part, they are writing about what people are already talking about, which isn't worth my time, but I understand it. However, I do agree that this most recent JG post was filth and really had no place, unless proven otherwise, it was 100% speculation, and was BleachReport level writing."

Can't expect a someone to stay in a shit hole because you think they should just suck it up and be loyal.   Alright I suppose if you really want to play that game. The first few years there was a bad deal made with them (Ticket guarantee) So people were pissed and thought they got taken, and had just renovated the Q, no real surprise no stadium got done there. Then we ran into that lovely rescission,  San Diego was know as Enron by the sea, about to go bankrupt; Shocker nothing got done in that time. So how realistic is that 14 year talking point Fabiani likes to throw out there whenever he gets a chance? Well I'll leave that up to each person. I do think mistakes were made in not making a better effort to get something done by the city, but I think throwing around the 14 years is a little disingenuous.    The stadium is a way past its expiration date and they could have left for the last 7 years. How is staying for 7 years when they didn't have to mean they are ""in a real hurry to leave town?""   If you'd kindly re-read my comment, I had said it seems that they are in a hurry to get out now that we have people in office that are willing to do something. They are holding a Mayor that is trying and willing to get something built responsible for the sins of past city leaders, and a rescission. That doesn't really sit well with me, if it sits well with you, that's cool, to each their own.   Honestly though, the chargers can barely sell out games and when they do, half the fans are rooting for the other team.   It's interesting how this gets brought up in a Vacuum. The threat of our team leaving has been hovering over our heads for 14 years. Regardless of the reasons (Rescission, bad city leaders, ticket deal, recent renovation) it has been looming. Is it really a surprise that fans might be hesitant to fully embrace a team that might leave?   If they leave, there is plenty of blame to go around, but yes they will be dead to me."

Chargers,3ar6k9,stinkb,3,Tue Jun 23 02:08:42 2015 UTC,This is total nfl propaganda.  Fabiani and the Chargers have blocked this process every step of the way.  The environmental impact report they are referring to won't take long at all.  They already know what the environmental impacts are of having a stadium on that site.  It would be a relatively quick process to put together a new EIR given all the data they already have. It's clear the Chargers have no intention of staying in San Diego and working in good faith with the city.  Sadly they've misled the fans all along claiming to want to find a solution. Shame on them.

Chargers,3ar6k9,stinkb,2,Tue Jun 23 00:59:03 2015 UTC,"EIR's are almost always challenged in court.  The Chargers have said they won't wait for the city to complete a new report.  A new report would take far less time to complete than an EIR normally would, given the fact that they know what to expect from having a stadium on that site since 1967.  So again it's the Chargers not being willing to work as a partner with the city."
Chargers,3ar6k9,froggy184,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:56:34 2015 UTC,"Maybe, but the Speaker of the Assembly is from SD and has outright stated that she could deliver a full exemption from the CEQA Law meaning no report needed at all.  Why isn't the City jumping on this?  They could be working on the economics while the Bill gets passed.  Instead, they're dismissing the business risk of Spanos getting hung up in court and missing any shot at LA.  He could end up completely fucked with no stadium in sight."

He makes 11 mil a year as the 5 highest paid receiver in the league behind Calvin, Demaryius, Dez, and Mike Wallace.  It's just not possible to pay everyone what they want, though I agree it's fun to day dream. Now if we had kept Sproles and never signed Donald, that's something I think about but man to be honest I'm pretty excited by the team we have."
Chargers,3asn2e,BFCrimson,-1,Tue Jun 23 17:39:07 2015 UTC,"If we're playing that game, I'd prefer to imagine the 2004-2008 teams with Rodney Harrison still on the roster, or any of the teams from 2004-2008 with a kicker not named Nate Kaeding.  Of all the mistakes AJ made, keeping Kaeding on the roster for so many seasons after it's clear he can't hack it under the pressure of the playoffs was probably the biggest--even bigger than letting Sproles or VJax go."

San Diego is a part of who I am and how I identify with myself.  If they move I cannot, will not root for them.  Both my grandfather and my father have passed away.

That's the consequence of a sweetheart deal the community granted the team that has allowed them to break their lease without consequences every year since 2007. They've stayed, at considerable cost to San Diego, which has had to pay for the upkeep of Qualcomm Stadium. Unless you believe that the Chargers, who have appeared in one Super Bowl in their history (and lost), bring some glitter to San Diego that translates into economic gain, the Chargers have been a deadweight loss to the community. Indeed, given its existing drivers of economic growth, including tourism, high-tech industry and the military, San Diego is the very model of a place that doesn't need the NFL. The Chargers' treatment of the community is nothing short of contemptuous."

Chargers,3aipf6,Lighterless,5,Sat Jun 20 20:39:47 2015 UTC,I think there is more to the economic impact of having a NFL team than just the income a stadium brings in. There are intangible positive impacts that are more difficult to put an accurate dollar amount on. Plus (assuming the team doesn't suck) a city behind a team is a unifying experience.
Chargers,3aipf6,BobTaco,1 point,Sun Jun 21 06:42:24 2015 UTC,There are intangible positive impacts that are more difficult to put an accurate dollar amount on.   Like what?    Plus (assuming the team doesn't suck) a city behind a team is a (costly) unifying experience.
Chargers,3aipf6,sounddude,1 point,Mon Jun 22 03:29:58 2015 UTC,"You're misunderstanding what the NFL's non-profit status meant. It only ever applied to the NFL home office in New York which paid rent on facilities, and the salaries of league officials and referees. The revenue distributed back to the teams was taxed as normal."
Chargers,3af2x1,BoltB11,25,Fri Jun 19 16:40:44 2015 UTC,There are several common denominators. The LOWEST common denominator is Mark Fabiani.
Chargers,3af2x1,BobTaco,10,Fri Jun 19 17:27:12 2015 UTC,"The funny thing is that Fabiani claimed the game changed this January when Kroenke made his Inglewood move, but he keeps parroting the false 14 year narrative. What a shitty double standard."
Chargers,3af2x1,TheRisingTide,15,Fri Jun 19 20:31:30 2015 UTC,Don't forget Dean and Alex.
Chargers,3af2x1,iblivininpain,4,Fri Jun 19 16:52:26 2015 UTC,Isn't Fabiani just a spokesperson for Dean Spanos? It isn't like Fabiani has a personal stake in moving to LA. Spanos does.
Chargers,3af2x1,willywonka159,7,Fri Jun 19 23:10:27 2015 UTC,"Fabiani is not just a spokeperson. He's a lawyer with a background in politics. His business currently, outside of being special counsel to Dean (his official title), is his ""strategic communications"" firm. Strategy, crisis management, etc.  So Fabiani is a clever, clever guy. He doesn't just speak for Dean. He schemes. Dean has a goal in mind; Fabiani figures out the way to achieve it and executes it. He also advises Dean. But as this stadium endeavor has waged on, I honestly think Fabiani is mainly manning the controls. 14 years on, he's tired of dealing with San Diego. There's personal stake right there.  The most analogous way to look at it is Dean is Prince John from the animated Robin Hood and Fabiani is that POS snake, Sir Hiss.   Additionally, Goldman Sachs wants the Chargers to move to LA. They're willing to foot the entire bill. Not only has GS been the longtime banker for the Chargers, and therefore already has a relationship with Fabiani, but Fabiani was also formerly on the GS payroll when GS needed a bit of crisis management in 2010. They've got a symbiotic relationship going on. There might be a stake in helping GS get the Chargers to LA."
Chargers,3af2x1,ace-destrier,3,Sat Jun 20 06:29:04 2015 UTC,Fabiani gets paid when Spanos' stake pays off. So yeah Fabiani has the same stake as Spanos
Chargers,3af2x1,deathsmaash,3,Sat Jun 20 03:32:50 2015 UTC,"@jcroe:   2015-06-19 12:30:03 UTC  In 14 years of failure to get a new @Chargers stadium, there's been one common denominator: Mark Fabiani.     [Mistake?] [Suggestion] [FAQ] [Code] [Issues]"
Chargers,3af2x1,TweetPoster,2,Fri Jun 19 16:41:51 2015 UTC,TIL that Mark Fabiani was a former deputy mayor to Los Angeles.
Chargers,3af2x1,historymajor44,2,Fri Jun 19 21:41:15 2015 UTC,"Hasn't the city turned down a lot of options over the years and been through numerous mayors?  I'm not saying he hasn't made mistakes, but to pin the blame one guy seems kind of dumb."
Chargers,3af2x1,elmatador12,1 point,Sat Jun 20 06:24:33 2015 UTC,Yes because its great business sense to fail at something for longer than a decade.
Chargers,3afmj2,ace-destrier,14,Fri Jun 19 19:10:19 2015 UTC,"Considering that 90% of fans will have little to no knowledge of the stadium proceedings, outside of what the nightly news tells them, I don't see this being a problem. If the Chargers do end up moving, it'll be a clean slate, they'll shell out money for PR, and in due time, no one will remember the stadium controversy.  Ravens fans weren't weary of supporting their new team when they moved controversially from Cleveland. See also: Indianapolis Colts, OKC Thunder, Tennessee Titans, Washington Nationals, etc, etc etc.  EDIT: By no means am I defending Fabiani.  He's a grade A asshat. But that's not going to stop people from being eventually being Chargers fans in LA"
Chargers,3afmj2,bt3k,8,Fri Jun 19 19:15:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Roggin is showing his bias here.   The NFL hasn't been in Los Angeles for over 20 years. There is a whole generation of kids who grew up without having any connection to the likes of the Rams and Raiders.   I want the Bolts to stay in SD, but if they go to LA, they shouldn't have much trouble building up a strong following."
Chargers,3afmj2,Bolt2006,2,Fri Jun 19 19:37:02 2015 UTC,"I want the Bolts to stay in SD, but if they go to LA, they shouldn't have much trouble building up a strong following.   What gives you that impression? Unless there's a major change in the way this franchise operates from the top down, which would almost certainly require new ownership at this point, the product is still going to be mediocre, and the promotion/PR aspect of the franchise is still going to be poor.  What's going to make anyone drop the team they currently root for in favor of the Los Angeles 9-7's?"
Chargers,3afmj2,BoiseNTheHood,10,Fri Jun 19 20:00:18 2015 UTC,"Mediocre? The Chargers are generally always in the playoff hunt(the team has averaged about 10 wins since 2004). Say what you want about Spanos, but his product has been far better then the likes of the Raiders and Rams."
Chargers,3afmj2,Bolt2006,-5,Fri Jun 19 20:09:03 2015 UTC,"We haven't sniffed double-digit wins in five years.  Our overall regular season win percentage under Spanos ownership is .505.  We are 7-9 in the playoffs under Spanos ownership with two separate playoff droughts of 10 and 9 years.  The Rams and Raiders, as bad as they've been lately, have both won championships more recently than the Chargers.    Despite this subpar track record, the Chargers benefit from a long history in San Diego, a fanbase that has existed for generations, and being one of only two pro sports teams in the market.  They have absolutely none of those advantages working for them in LA.  The only leg they'd have to stand on is their mere presence in the city, and LA fans don't show up for mediocrity, so even that doesn't matter."
Chargers,3afmj2,BoiseNTheHood,2,Fri Jun 19 20:20:37 2015 UTC,"The Clippers do well in LA and they have been far worse then the Chargers over the last 10-15 years. Like the poster above me said, we have seen teams move to other cites and quickly establish a fanbase."
Chargers,3afmj2,Bolt2006,3,Fri Jun 19 20:30:46 2015 UTC,"Even the Clippers had a small core fanbase until recently.   Like the poster above me said, we have seen teams move to other cites and quickly establish a fanbase.    Usually they're moving to markets that don't have anywhere near as many pro sports options and entertainment options in general as LA does.    If you're going to move to the second-biggest media market in the nation, you'd better have your shit together going in.  Nothing that Dean has ever done with this franchise suggests that the Chargers will have their shit together."
Chargers,3afmj2,BoiseNTheHood,3,Fri Jun 19 20:34:53 2015 UTC,"The last decade says other wise IMO. Put a state of the art NFL stadium there and a competitive team and it will do well.   I think some in San Diego are being naive about this. All of LA sports teams draw pretty well, there are a ton of people there and the NFL is the biggest sport in the country."
Chargers,3afmj2,Bolt2006,3,Fri Jun 19 20:41:50 2015 UTC,As someone from San Diego I agree. Let's not act like we are selling out every game. Half the time there are more fans of the other team. Probably won't be worse in LA
Chargers,3afmj2,highastronaut,-1,Sat Jun 20 04:14:36 2015 UTC,"The last decade says other wise IMO.   The last decade of zero rings, playoff failures with the most stacked team in the league, all the talent fleeing our roster in free agency, and AJ and Norv?"
Chargers,3afmj2,BoiseNTheHood,5,Fri Jun 19 20:54:09 2015 UTC,"4 AFC west titles, 5 playoff appearances, and an appearances in the AFC championship game.  I don't know why you keep making it sound as if the Bolts have been this below average franchise. They aren't, they are generally a competent team that is always in the playoff hunt."
Chargers,3afmj2,Bolt2006,-1,Fri Jun 19 21:09:05 2015 UTC,They draw fans when they do well. If the team sucks the attendance dries up.
Chargers,3afmj2,Pittyswains,5,Fri Jun 19 23:48:11 2015 UTC,"This is a city that has supported the Clippers for years and years while the Lakers were winning championships. Shouldn't be too difficult, regardless of the product on the field. LA is a big place."
Chargers,3afmj2,bt3k,3,Fri Jun 19 20:08:28 2015 UTC,This is a city that has supported the Clippers for years and years while the Lakers were winning championships   Lol no. I've lived in Los Angeles my whole life and nobody gave a single fuck about the Clippers until about 2 years ago. Even then most of this town still hates LAC and LAL still runs Los Angeles. I feel it will matter wether the Chargers are good or not.
Chargers,3afmj2,zzyyxxqq,2,Fri Jun 19 22:52:25 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying that LA would ever love the Clips over the Lakers, no matter how successful the Clippers become.  What I'm saying is that the franchise has done well enough to still sell tickets, have die-hard fans, and be worth 2 Billion dollars, in spite of being owned by a racist prick for 33 years.  Saying there is no Clippers fans in LA is about as naive as saying that everyone in LA still loves the Raiders."
Chargers,3afmj2,bt3k,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:55:35 2015 UTC,"As a LAC fan, this is completely true.  LA does not support that team very well at all, even as a championship contender.  LA rooted for the Warriors over the Clippers in last years playoffs.  Heartbreaking."
Chargers,3afmj2,winterborne1,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:40:54 2015 UTC,"are you surprised though? the Clippers are relevant right now because of the misfortunes of the Lakers (basketball reasons), I think it's hilarious. When the Clips blew the series vs Houston, Dodger Stadium started cheering. I'm not even going to start the whole ""it's a Laker town"" shit on here. But the Clippers will always be under the Lakers, Dodgers, Kings, both college football teams."
Chargers,3afmj2,MikeMcNorv,0,Sat Jun 20 08:58:58 2015 UTC,"The same goes with the Warriors though.  They also succeeded because the Lakers failed.  They are division rivals, too.  It really is heartbreaking that LA fans would support a division rival from a city that HATES LA over a team that is FROM LA."
Chargers,3afmj2,winterborne1,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:31:40 2015 UTC,"well I'm talking more of if David Stern doesn't veto that Chris Paul trade, the Clippers would still be at the bottom, the Lakers would still be at the top. The Warriors have had the same group for years now, it was only a matter of time until everything clicked for them."
Chargers,3afmj2,MikeMcNorv,0,Sat Jun 20 20:59:11 2015 UTC,"And that really wasn't the Clippers fault, either."
Chargers,3afmj2,winterborne1,1 point,Sat Jun 20 21:11:52 2015 UTC,this gave me a great laugh. Thanks for this man.
Chargers,3afmj2,MikeMcNorv,1 point,Sat Jun 20 08:54:13 2015 UTC,"New ownership is what I'm thinking will happen. Most of the Spanos' wealth is tied up in the Chargers and Alex Spanos is 91. If you wanted to sell the team, it would make the most sense to move to LA as quickly as possible, PR be damned, and then sell the team shortly after. The new ownership would ""cleanse"" the team of the bad blood with Spanos so to speak."
Chargers,3afmj2,rockyct,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:01:14 2015 UTC,The only chance of Spanos selling the team is if he loses out in LA and doesn't get a stadium in SD.   He would make more money owning a team in LA then selling it.
Chargers,3afmj2,Bolt2006,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:06:34 2015 UTC,"Over the long run perhaps owning an LA team is better because the franchise will probably go up in value, but once the Chargers move to LA the franchise will be worth a lot more than it is right now."
Chargers,3afmj2,rockyct,7,Fri Jun 19 22:09:09 2015 UTC,"What's hilarious is that if they keep the Rams from moving back, they not only screw San Diego, they screw LA out of one of the teams they actually want to move. What a way to endear yourself to a market.  I know this sub doesn't think highly of Los Angeles, but trust me, very few people up here want the Bolts to come also. Rams would already be on their way home if it wasn't for Spanos and Fabiani."
Chargers,3afmj2,Seductive_Santa,3,Fri Jun 19 19:39:39 2015 UTC,"People in LA just want a NFL team.  Whoever it ends up being, they'll support."
Chargers,3afmj2,bt3k,7,Fri Jun 19 19:45:30 2015 UTC,"Market studies have suggested that the Rams and Raiders have large built in fanbases, while the Chargers are a distant third in terms of built in support.  I would agree that any team would eventually get embraced, but there are teams the market wants over others."
Chargers,3afmj2,Seductive_Santa,2,Fri Jun 19 20:16:38 2015 UTC,"The PR spin will be the same no matter what team moves back. And it will most likely work.  X team was in LA, now they're back! Give us money!  Despite the fact that the Chargers have spent 40+ years in SD, and 1 in LA, they'll make promo packages for days about that one season."
Chargers,3afmj2,bt3k,0,Fri Jun 19 20:21:30 2015 UTC,"And all those promo packages will be black &white, because color TV hadn't been invented yet!"
Chargers,3afmj2,Orgasmo3000,0,Sat Jun 20 01:45:39 2015 UTC,You're missing a huge component of this. It's not going to be just the chargers that move back. It's going to be either the chargers + raiders or the chargers + rams. They lose both fights to get a fanbase as both teams have more history in LA than the chargers.

Chargers,3afmj2,Seductive_Santa,8,Fri Jun 19 19:22:06 2015 UTC,"He said he wants a picture with Fabiani smiling lol.   Roggin has seriously taken the lead on the NFL to LA issue, and has seen through Fabiani and Carson the whole time. Fabiani plays on the fact that people don't pay constant attention to this (owners included) and works hard to drive the narrative to work in the Chargers' favor.   The one making the most noise isn't always getting work done. Chargers and Raiders have purchased $22 million in land only. Kroenke has at least $200 million sunk into his land. Give this a few months and it will become clear that one stadium will get built. That doesn't guarantee the Bolts will stay, but Carson isn't gonna happen."

I don't think any team would accept taking just 2/3 of what their market is providing them and giving it to another team.  But you did say it was a dream scenario"
Chargers,3agljp,toekneebalogna,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:40:01 2015 UTC,"Well, that depends.    If Kroenke moves without the blessing of the NFL, the NFL can't stop him (See: LA Colosseum v. NFL), but they could theoretically cut his share of Broadcasting Revenue from games his team isn't playing in.  Then, given that Broadcasting Revenue dwarfs Local Revenue, the question would be a balance of which of the following has the best projected value:   66.6% of LA-Local + 1/32nd of Broadcasting 100% of St Louis-Local + 1/32nd of Broadcasting 100% of LA-Local + some fraction of the Broadcasting from Rams games (probably less than 1/2, because the NFL has costs, too..)   Though you're right, the more reasonable split would be treating SD Local & LA Local as a single pot, and splitting it evenly between the Chargers & Rams.  It would really come down to how much the NFL want to slap down Kroenke for being upstarts."
Chargers,3agljp,EasilyAnnoyed,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:53:19 2015 UTC,My fantasy is Kroenke forks 300-400m to help pay for a stadium in SD.
Chargers,3agljp,EasilyAnnoyed,2,Sun Jun 21 19:51:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but why would he just cough up $300M, unless his increased revenue from LA over that time would be more than that?  Why would Dean accept that as a viable option if the loss of LA revenue was more than that?"
Chargers,3agljp,EasilyAnnoyed,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:39:54 2015 UTC,The increase of value of the Rams would offset that.
Chargers,3agljp,EasilyAnnoyed,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:46:46 2015 UTC,"Why would the value of the Rams increase?  Because they'd come to own the LA Market, which the Chargers currently own (technically).  Seriously, as far as the Spanos family is concerned, the problem with anybody moving in to LA (other than the Chargers) is that the benefit that such a team would see would be at the expense of the Chargers.  Any benefit that they claim would be a benefit that the Chargers no longer can.  Anything that is of sufficient value to offset that loss isn't going to be palatable to such a team.  Let's try to calculate this.  Assume, for the sake of argument, that each year, a team gets $1/person in their Home market, and 10¢/person in a Claimed market.  The population of the following Media Markets are as follows:   Los Angeles: 10,609,200 San Diego: 2,485,600 St Louis: 2,210,800   Do the Chargers have 100% Market penetration in LA?  Not even close (but it has been growing, and we're apparently 4th, in LA County).  Will we be able to continue to increase market penetration with the Rams there if we aren't? No, and we'll probably lose a goodly portion of what we have.  Our ~7% market penetraion of LA is almost as much as the 47% market penetration of San Diego county.  If that gets cut in half, that's something like 1/5 the total fans..."
Chargers,3agljp,autowikibot,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:00:39 2015 UTC,Moving a team to LA will increase its value several hundred million if you have to share it with another team. It increases far more if you don't have to share.
Chargers,3agljp,Flesh_Lettuce,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:27:35 2015 UTC,"Realistically claiming the LA market will do that, yes.  My point is that the Chargers have been slowly claiming it over the past 20-ish, and in another 20 would have it pretty solidly locked.  ...meaning that Dean doesn't want anybody else moving in to LA unless he's there, too, because that's several hundred million that he stands to lose.  In other words, you're answering why Kroenke would be willing to pay for it, but not why Dean would consider that an acceptable payment."

If they were building on or near wetlands of some sort - I bet you don't get this exemption approved.    Now let's be specific: If you're building right next to a stadium that's existed for a millenium or two like ours has, fairly low risk.  I wouldn't be surprised if we still get a barebones environmental impact study that hits the key points in tandem with early development/permitting, and if there's something extremely important, they can throw the brakes on.  If you get exemption and then we find out that you've absolutely destroyed habitat of a native salamander, and are punching carcinogenic chemicals into the groundwater, etc., etc., you don't get an ""oh well, they were exempted"", it's still a big deal.  An exemption here isn't a buyoff to go fuck the ecosystem."
Chargers,3ac3rn,TheFakeTomTelesco,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:16:17 2015 UTC,"That's a great question, but not one that matters to this issue.  What's the point of using a 30 year old EIR?  CEQA is a block that has to be checked.  The Legislature passed it, and so if they exempt this project, there is no legal challenge possible."
Chargers,3ac3rn,BobTaco,2,Thu Jun 18 22:18:37 2015 UTC,"Amending part of the EIR makes sense. Noise impact, traffic impact, etc would remain virtually the same because a stadium is already there. What might screw stuff up is new laws dealing with the river, and the fact that their plans show other developed buildings besides the stadium (parking structure, restaurants, etc). I don't know if the EIR needs to just deal with the stadium, or all of it.  As for going around the EIR and trying to get exempt from it, that opens it up to a lot of lawsuits they are trying to avoid. That said, cut corners on an EIR will lead to just as many lawsuits.  Regardless, EIRs are a waste of money and rarely accurate at all. Just red tape to make sure people can't just do whatever...like avoiding EIRs in Carson and Inglewood because it's a ballot initiative. Stupid loopholes are stupid. Either way people can sue."

Chargers,3ac3rn,PencilFaceButt,-1,Fri Jun 19 16:16:38 2015 UTC,"The end goal of the Chargers and the NFL is to get something for free.  Putting it through a vote like Faulkner wants to do absolves him of any responsibility if the Chargers leave.  He's a politician.  That's what politicians do.  The Chargers are a business.  It is not smart business to spend 1 billion of your own money when you can get the City to pay for it and give it to you.  The legislature exempt this supposed project from CEQA would still require a vote.  One which the Chargers don't want.  The Chargers are like the ugly girlfriend that used to be hot and now has gained a lot of weight and is fat and is asking us if we still love her we would buy her a new Lexus.  She hasn't even won a gosh darn Super Bowl and she wants a Lexus?  No, she gets Qualcomm."
Chargers,3ac3rn,PencilFaceButt,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:36:03 2015 UTC,"From what I understand Satisfactory EIR/CEQA Exemption + successful public vote = bulletproof deal from a legal perspective.  I'd say the Chargers do want a vote.  If the vote fails, then they're leaving and cannot be blamed.  If the above scenario plays out, whatever economic structure they agree to with the City/County is solid and they get a stadium here.    The worst thing for the Chargers would be to jump aboard an EIR that is questionable, the vote is successful and some asshole sues the City to stop the project.  This is their greatest fear from what I can tell.  The Rams & Raiders do Inglewood, and the Chargers are shit outta luck.  I don't blame them for demanding maximum assurance that any deal they make with the City is going to be legally solid.  Having Faulconer's political advisor out in the media trashing the Chargers and Fabiani while not pursuing a very real CEQA exemption through Toni Atkins, indicates to me that it is in fact the City that doesn't want this to happen.  They are in full PR/Blame the Chargers mode now and have probably destroyed any possible agreement.  They are doing exactly what Fabiani suspected from the beginning, providing themselves political cover and scapegoating the team."
Chargers,3ac3rn,PencilFaceButt,-1,Fri Jun 19 23:41:28 2015 UTC,That EIR is not questionable once updated. But the Chargers want you to believe that the EIR that was sunmitted years ago would be exactly the it was thirty years ago. It wouldn't be once updated.   Think about it from the Chargers (NFLs) perspective. If San Diego feels like its the last call on the Chargers before they leave they are hoping we give them everything to stay.   Be a little smarter than that and don't let your emotions get in the way. I have got a son and I want him to grow up to appreciate San Diego sports. But it's not my team. It's Deans.

I love our team, which is irrevocably rooted in our fair city... perhaps moreso than any other sports team in the city's history... mainly because of one man.   I rooted for us with big ass bolts and my first jersey when we had an all-time great who was a born and bred San Diegan native during the miracle super bowl run.  You can't have the Chargers without 55, and you don't have 55 without San Diego.  That was something special and quite a rarity in any sport.

Seau's, LT peddling Oggis to us,  Keiser advertising for the gaslamp, Rivers being an active Catholic community leader,  etc.  In LA, we wouldn't get any of that.   The place is all about money, crime, and flashy shit.... the rich areas are usually populated by Hollywood scum (it's all about partying - not about community there, unlike  much of SD landscape, where you have nice houses in a lot of different places in the county and you can sit on a PTA board where your kids can still go to a public school where not everyone is sucking down a trust fund).  Apart from that, San Diegans wouldn't tap into any community benefits even if LA athletes were big on being community members.  I wouldn't care if Melvin Ingram opened a bar in LA.  I'd go to one if it was in SD.  Think about this, as well: we had a huge, and long-standing rivalry in this sport, just like every sport, with a team from LA.  We hate that cesspool.  And anyone who has lived there long enough and yet had the fortune of living in SD for any length of time would agree.   It's a terrible place full of terrible fans.

Chargers,3acpu9,bt3k,3,Fri Jun 19 07:04:16 2015 UTC,"Great point. And furthermore, from someone who currently lives in LA County, the Raiders presence is not as great as people think it is. A lot of assumption get thrown around this sub."
Chargers,3acpu9,MIBPJ,3,Fri Jun 19 08:17:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I live in LA too and agree. The idea that there are no Chargers fans up here or that they make up only 3% of fans (or whatever number people use) is just crazy. Raider presence is definitely there in East LA but I think that has as much to do with the brand and trying to be like NWA as it does with the team itself. West LA is more of a mix and I think that if the Chargers did end up moving to LA they would dominate take over the Westside.  The idea that you can use the fan make up of a teamless city to predict whats going to happen has no validity at all. The people follow those teams because they don't' have a hometown team to root for. That would have been like saying in the mid-90's, ""Baltimore is Redskin's territory. If you try moving a team there no one is going to jump on board and the team will fail"". You can say the same thing about the Titans moving to Tennessee, the ""new Browns"", the Texans, the Jaguars, and even the Rams and Raiders. If there's a team in town, people start liking them. There just isn't a case where a team moved somewhere and failed because the team couldn't pull people away from whatever team they were already following. Has that happened in any sport?  I think that almost everyone, myself included, can agree that the Chargers staying in SD and facing no competition from an LA team is the best possible outcome but them moving to LA is far from the worst. It really comes down to whether you would rather have them stay in So Cal but move a few hours up the road, or would you rather see them have there market completely undercut and end up who knows where?"
Chargers,3acpu9,bt3k,4,Fri Jun 19 16:16:49 2015 UTC,"From someone who lives in East LA and works in West LA, I 1000% agree with you. West LA would be Chargers territory, no doubt."
Chargers,3acpu9,PsychicWarElephant,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:08:22 2015 UTC,If the Raiders went back it would sure as hell be.
Chargers,3acpu9,FriarFanatic,2,Sat Jun 20 14:01:26 2015 UTC,"Well there is a different dynamic working in that case, a lot of ""Raider fans"" like the team for the image, not necessarily the football alone. See: NWA"
Chargers,3acpu9,MIBPJ,2,Mon Jun 22 21:58:43 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I actually pointed out the whole NWA thing just the other day. I just think its funny how people on this sub can hold too mutually exclusive ideas in their head without realizing that it doesn't make sense: anybody would abandon their team if it moved AND the chargers would fail in LA because the Raiders have a lockdown on the city. Raiders fandom in LA, if its as pervasive as this sub likes to pretend, also undermines the idea that LA only likes winning teams and abandons a team once it starts losing."
Chargers,3acpu9,FriarFanatic,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:35:58 2015 UTC,"I can only speak for myself as a Chargers fan; but I've met two types of Raider fans. The football fans, and ones that are kinda football fans, but are more drawn to the ""Image"" of the team. The first is more dominant in the place they currently play, the latter in the place where they used to reside.   The other part to think about, if the Raiders do move to LA, they would absolutely have a leg up on the Chargers in terms of getting fans in the area, and that would hurt the team.   Not sure if that helps."
Chargers,3acpu9,GreatestDenier,18,Mon Jun 22 22:50:37 2015 UTC,"In LA, we wouldn't get any of that. The place is all about money, crime, and flashy shit.... the rich areas are usually populated by Hollywood scum (it's all about partying - not about community there, unlike much of SD landscape, where you have nice houses in a lot of different places in the county and you can sit on a PTA board where your kids can still go to a public school where not everyone is sucking down a trust fund). Apart from that, San Diegans wouldn't tap into any community benefits even if LA athletes were big on being community members.    Man, as someone who's actually lived in both this is such a hilarious mischaracterization. It's like completely based on episodes of Beverly Hills 90210, The OC and Housewives of Whogivesaflyingfuck. The truth is both, San Diego and LA, are full of people with families working their hardest to get by. Los Angeles is not a one-industry town like you seem to think it is. Not everyone there is peddling a shitty screenplay, running around to casting calls and  trying to score coke. People wake up, take their kids to school and go to work every morning like in San Diego and every other city in the world. It's a big place full of many communities with PTA meetings, churches and all that other crap you seem to think doesn't exist there.   I get it. You're mad that Spanos wants to move the team. That just fucking sucks, but you don't have to boogeyman a city that quite frankly wants nothing to do with the Chargers right now. Spanos is trying to fuck them too by preventing a team they actually want, the Rams, from moving back. Nobody from Los Angeles ever speaks about San Diego with this much vitriol."
Chargers,3acpu9,MIBPJ,16,Fri Jun 19 04:31:11 2015 UTC,Yeah this sub has one of the most hilarious impressions of LA I've ever seen. Apparently the city is composed entirely of gangsters and wannabe actors. Its shocking that most of the people who post here live a couple hours outside LA and most have actually been there. The fact that the hatred is one directional and unreciprocated makes it kind of pathetic.

Chargers,3acpu9,TheFakeTomTelesco,0,Sat Jun 20 16:25:43 2015 UTC,"That's like saying the Cardinals began in Chicago.  No one cares.

You do realize that all of Sourhern California gets an F in air quality and LA has only 6-7% more pollution than SD, right? The effect of time is much greater than any inter-county difference. All air quality has improved and SD last year had about the same air quality as LA last year. The difference between LA and SD is smaller than SD and OC."
Chargers,3acpu9,TheFakeTomTelesco,1 point,Sun Jun 21 04:10:35 2015 UTC,"Air quality is fine due to that nice east/west breeze.   It's the view (or lack thereof) that gets obscured by the brown haze in LA, and the fact that you get that nice color floating around San Bernardino, the OC, etc."

Chargers,3abbnq,cheddy720,24,Fri Jun 19 16:34:47 2015 UTC,"I tend to agree with Faulconer that the Chargers made up their minds to move a year ago, and their claims of wanting to work with San Diego on a new stadium are just lip service to satisfy the NFL's requirement that they exhaust all options with SD before formally requesting to move. They don't really want to participate in a new San Diego stadium proposal that may or may not be successful and would likely put them out of the running for LA, but they can't just say so because it would put them in violation of the NFL's relocation rules.   If this is the case, the city has to petition to the NFL that they have not been negotiating in good faith on a new stadium, and that the CSAG proposal is a serious one with the potential to come to fruition. If they can successfully argue that case, they might be able to throw a wrench in the Chargers plans and prevent them from being allowed to move."
Chargers,3abbnq,kr0kodil,5,Thu Jun 18 18:51:23 2015 UTC,But I thought it didn't matter what the NFL says about relocation.  Wasn't it that every single team that left their city did it without the NFL's consent?  Can't really tell a private business how to operate.
Chargers,3abbnq,kr0kodil,8,Thu Jun 18 18:53:24 2015 UTC,"The NFL has strengthened its rules regarding relocation since the last team moved (Rams in '94). Remember both the Seahawks and Raiders tried to make unilateral moves in recent years, only to back off when threatened with serious sanctions by the NFL.   It's a legal grey area that may be decided by the courts."

Chargers,3abbnq,IamMrT,6,Fri Jun 19 00:29:40 2015 UTC,"Well either way, Spanos isn't really rich enough to afford a fine or able to deal with a lengthy lawsuit if he wants to be in LA as soon as possible. Also he needs the money the NFL is offering to help with stadium costs and such. So if he violates the relocation rules, it's not like he's Kroenke where he can just say ""fuck you, I'll do it on my own dime""."
Chargers,3abbnq,PencilFaceButt,6,Thu Jun 18 19:27:15 2015 UTC,"I would bet that Spanos has no intention to move but rather he is using this whole Kroenke thing as leverage.  St. Louis is building a new stadium.  Whether it's the Rams or the Raiders that play there, we shall see.  I honestly think San Diego should tell the Chargers that we will wait to see what comes of St. Louis before we start taking finances while still working towards the goal of completing the E.I.R. and following through with a vote.  I've got a feeling that the Chargers are trying to strong arm the San Diego politicians into not doing a vote because no way a vote passes for the Chargers favor.  They want to get something done before and they want a lot of incentives included.  I think Mission Valley is greater than Carson but San Diego might be playing for downtown.  I appreciate the mayor pulling the trigger by starting to label the Chargers as goners because now the Chargers might have to rethink their stance a bit.  They may have gone a bit to far if they are playing hardball."
Chargers,3abbnq,barrydiesel,5,Thu Jun 18 19:39:30 2015 UTC,"I'd have to agree with you. I don't believe that moving to Carson will be a huge upgrade for the Chargers in terms of profits. If they share a stadium with the Raiders, most would-be Charger fans would probably become Raider fans instead. I also doubt there would be many commuters from San Diego to the games. I definitely agree that if a new stadium funded in part by taxpayer dollars were to go on a ballot, it would be laughably voted down. If they go, I think they'd legitimately be screwing themselves over.   The best part is that Rivers basically said he's not interested in moving to LA. If Gates and Weddle are gone too, I can easily picture a completely mediocre team in Carson with tons of empty seats for years and years to come. It's going to be pretty funny to see."
Chargers,3abbnq,dannymac1784,2,Fri Jun 19 01:22:22 2015 UTC,"You'd be foolish to think that. Since the Clippers were sold for 2 billion, simply moving the team there THEN selling would be profitable. Everyone knows that and he has no ties to San Diego. Sure, he lived there and its great, but at what point do you think this is all a bigger power move to broker cashing out and leaving operations to their kids, who...gasp....spend time in LA."
Chargers,3abbnq,PencilFaceButt,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:42:57 2015 UTC,So what you are saying is they are good as gone?  That means we have to do nothing because the conclusion is set.   Faulciner maybe knows this already and this explains his political cover. I.e. Chargers are good as gone.
Chargers,3abbnq,dannymac1784,1 point,Fri Jun 19 05:08:21 2015 UTC,just look at it as a whole. its come to slinging insults. usually cities trying to retain the team doesnt sink to that level.
Chargers,3abbnq,Seductive_Santa,2,Fri Jun 19 06:44:52 2015 UTC,Good point
Chargers,3abbnq,froggy184,9,Thu Jun 18 19:29:04 2015 UTC,"Carson hasn't been leverage only against San Diego, it's leverage against Kroenke as well. The idea that Spanos could build his own stadium helps him get the best possible deal to shack up with the Rams in Inglewood. This isn't about wanting to be in LA, it's about making sure nobody else can have it, at least to themselves.  I don't think that the Bolts understand that they will be the B team in any LA situation. They think they can outsell the Raiders in terms of sponsorship and PSLs, due to the stigma surrounding the team, but the Raiders draw a lot of water in LA and I wouldn't be so sure. If they went with the Rams, it wouldn't even be close.  Point being, the Bolts are the undisputed big dog in SD, but in LA they're gonna have to fight for their share of the pie, and I'm not so sure they're up to the task."
Chargers,3abbnq,froggy184,9,Thu Jun 18 19:22:27 2015 UTC,"Look, the Chargers would be foolish to sign on to a ballot initiative that could be subject to legal challenge.  We all know there are dicks out there who are waiting to do this.  Until yesterday, I thought the City was being straight with the Chargers and that they were the ones playing games.  Now I can see the Chargers point about political cover.  The City came up with a plan that would use a 30 year old EIR as the basis for addressing the CEQA problem.  I wouldn't hitch my wagon to that either if I owned the Chargers.  They would be left with no deal in sight if they signed up for this and it ended up in court for years.    If the CA legislature passes legislation to exempt the deal from CEQA and the Chargers blow this off, THEN that would be conclusive proof that they are not acting in good faith.  Toni Atkins, the Speaker of the Assembly is from San Diego and she has said she could make this happen.  If the City doesn't take her up on this, they are showing that they are not serious."
Chargers,3abbnq,BobTaco,3,Thu Jun 18 19:31:57 2015 UTC,Makes sense.  So how come we don't hear this side of the story?  Because the Union Trib is own by LATimes now? lol

This has been out there for a month now, and I haven't heard the City mention it as part of their game plan.    Interestingly, she says that she can deliver this legislation subject to an agreement between the Chargers and the City.  Why isn't the City emphasizing this?"

Chargers,3abbnq,Bsul21,3,Fri Jun 19 01:42:31 2015 UTC,"There is a vote because people can sue saying the public didn't really want the stadium. The difference is that because there are no new taxes, the vote is majority instead of 2/3.  The biggest issue is that the Chargers have options. If they go all in with SD, the door shuts on everything else. If SD fails...they are screwed with no options. So they at being dicks about everything so they don't give the opinion they are all in with SD so doors don't shut on Carson/Englewood.  The other issue is they probably wanted to sneak out of SD quietly...and now people are fighting and making stuff harder."
Chargers,3abbnq,imperialslough,5,Thu Jun 18 19:39:08 2015 UTC,"You could replace chargers with sonics and San Diego with Seattle and the way this has unfolded would be no different from how Seattle lost there basketball team a few years ago.

Chargers,3abbnq,TheRisingTide,2,Thu Jun 18 22:57:42 2015 UTC,"Yes, it is quite like that situation. However, it isn't like they were competing with another franchise to move. The Rams are a near lock to move and I just don't buy the Chargers also moving to Inglewood. San Diego will be forced to settle their dispute as well as the raiders will eventually get something figured out. Also, what's with the constant LA hate? LA isn't causing this to happen and I find most people who hate LA just hate it for reasons which are ridiculous because they don't know the ins and outs of LA. I lived in San Diego for 2 years and just moved back to LA. In many aspects, San Diego is very much like West LA/culver city where I live now and The Valley where my wife grew up. For having so much hatred for LA, most san diegans often don't know what the hell they are talking about. It isn't like they are rival cities or anything."

Chargers,3abbnq,thirdhonk,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:15:25 2015 UTC,"It appears that the Chargers don't want Mission Valley, would prefer downtown SD but with the way things are going they don't see that happening and they don't want to miss out on LA (Carson or Inglewood) so they are making their push to lock it up (or at least reserve a spot there). I don't understand all the dynamics with the hoteliers/convention space etc but I do think the competing interests is what is in the way of Downtown being an option. Spanos is pissed that the Falconer won't stand up to the hoteliers that don't want Spanos around (hoteliers are big Faulconer supporters). This is his complaint about Falconer going for political cover. Aso, Fowler might not be too keen on the Chargers Downtown as the Padres renegotiated terms with the City to create favorable incentive to host events like the Stones/Taylor Swift concerts- the Chargers would be taking money from them if they were going after the same events.  Maybe it is meaningless, but I did notice Spans and Fowler sitting together at a Pads game a few days ago. I just wish Spanos would be more direct about his desires/intentions and not pretend to entertain the CSAG MV structure. They could have said, Downtown or we are out. Also, Fuck Fabiani."

I considered other former Chargers, but didn't think they had Magic Johnson-like cash lying around.  I also considered San Diegan actors/directors/musicians but I don't know their football allegiance if they even follow football.   Mostly, I thought of San Diego-affiliated people because I assume that they would be more inclined to keep the team here, but there could be a Steve Ballmer out there or a Ray Kroc, like you said.

Ingram’s weight loss is of a similar nature to Miller’s in 2013, who dropped 25 pounds after tearing his ACL. Miller went on to have 14 sacks in 13 games the next year.   As far as I can see, Miller had 14 sacks in 16 games in 2014.  But regardless, Von Miller had already recorded 11.5 and 18.5 sack seasons before the injury."

Chargers,3a7qtg,I_AM_METALUNA,33,Thu Jun 18 00:15:49 2015 UTC,Poor Spanos didn't get the hundreds of millions in public funds he's trying to extort in a timely manner.   I hope he was able to put food on the table in the mean time.
Chargers,3a7qtg,Crippled_Giraffe,5,Thu Jun 18 00:34:43 2015 UTC,"Let's look at this from a purely financial perspective. The cost of a new stadium is circa 1bn give or take, using it as an easy figure, not because that's what he'd actually borrow. Spanos doesn't have that money, so he'll have to borrow to fund the building of the stadium through a loan.  Now, you go to the bank and say, ""hello mr. bank I want 1bn to build a stadium in SD, here's my income projections for the forseeable future, see it's super affordable"", mr. bank says ""well Dean, you know that two teams are about to move into your yard in LA, so these income projections are likely a pile of shit because those two teams are going to draw away a large portion of your LA fanbase,"" Dean mutters a quiet ""fuck"" under his breath as Mr. Bank chuckles, ""Yeah, the loans I'm gonna give to those LA teams will be at much better rates because they're gonna fucking rake dem dollaz in, that tv market is huge up there and a competitive team would be an instant draw"" Mr. Bank stands up and goes to get your loan document for the SD stadium and Dean begins to think about why it should be him moving to LA and making dem dollaz. He's tried for years to make SD work and the useless fucks in government are only trying to move now... It makes him angry and sad...  Mr. Bank comes back a while later with your loan agreement, he's also strapped on a much higher interest rate to borrow because the risk involved is now that much higher due to the potential loss of revenue streams.   Anyway! So you borrow a billion, let's say you get an interest rate of 4%, that's 40mill a year you'll have to find to pay the interest alone. You also have the capital repayments, say a 40 year loan, thats a further 2 million a month you've gotta find to cover the capital repayments (24-25 mill a year), so all in your shiney new stadium is costing you 65 mill a year.   OK, you say, they have a nice shiney new stadium and can rent it out for stuff etc, etc. But that only covers so much and the major problem is that San Diego is a small market. Always has been, always will be. The team just doesn't have the draw for some reason. (makes no sense to me, I'm from Ireland and I was drawn to them, but that's another issue. ha)  The problem (and this is, I think, Spanos' real issue and worry about staying in SD) with staying in San Diego and financing a stadium is that it allows another 2 teams get into LA. The Chargers draws a lot of its support from the southern LA region (OC etc). Now what happens if a new team sets up in LA, all that support begins to dwindle away and support that team, mightn't happen today or tomorrow, but over time it definitely will. So now, you've got a massive loan around your neck, your income base (fans) has fallen, you have less money to work with so your ability to sign decent free agents, or give big signing bonuses to guys in house who deserve it goes down, so the product on the field suffers, which in turn draws more support away... And this is a vicious circle that doesn't easily resolve itself.  Now, his other option is to move to LA, bring in more money, in a massive media market, which will allow you to compete for all the best free agents and pay them top dollar because you have the money, so you are always a side who's competitive....  Yes, it sucks from the fans perspective. But San Diego with two teams in LA just doesn't work as a location for a team that can be competitive and that's what Spanos has realised I think unfortunately.  The real prick in all this is the NFL's need to have 2 teams up there. 1 would have been much easier to deal with. :(   Anyway, thanks for reading and please don't just downvote if you disagree with something, that's not the reddit way."
Chargers,3a7qtg,theoriginalfathead,3,Thu Jun 18 11:50:53 2015 UTC,The NFL has profit sharing all TV revenue and merchandise sales (other than the Cowboys) are shared across the teams.  It's not like they were losing money when the Raiders and Rams were in LA previously and the revenues have only gone up since then.
Chargers,3a7qtg,Crippled_Giraffe,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:15:56 2015 UTC,"True. Revenues have gone up, but local revenue is still kept by each individual team. And if national revenue is split 32 ways, it doesn't matter what it is, the pie is still the same for each team.  So those teams with large fan bases and large local markets will do better financially because their local incomes will be much higher, mainly through their ability to sell tickets at a higher price and fill their corporate boxes regularly. If that weren't true then each team would be valued at the exact same figure, which they aren't.  If you're a big so cal company and you want to show off to clients you'll do that in la first and SD last. That's nothing against SD, its merely a reality of the fact that la is where all the businesses are.   So SD would have to be cheaper to attract people which would mean less money for the team."
Chargers,3a7qtg,theoriginalfathead,2,Thu Jun 18 15:40:04 2015 UTC,"I get that there is more luxury box money in LA and they could probably get more in PSL's as well.   I understand why the team is looking to move and previously I still said I'd support them as I'd rather the city spend the money elsewhere like expanding the convention center, but the seemingly duplicitous nature of how the team has gone about this move has turned me sour."
Chargers,3a7qtg,Crippled_Giraffe,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:46:21 2015 UTC,"I agree that they have acted like pricks for the past year. And if will leave  sour taste. But look at it from their point of view, for over a decade they have been trying to get a deal done in SD. They have been shot down time and time again.   Every proposal they came up with was passed on by those in the political sphere, why? Because the boys in city hall knew that the chargers didn't have the backing in league circles to leave.   There were other places, bigger teams, who needed and wanted a stadium first and the league wasn't ready to try L.A. again yet. So the chargers kept plugging away, trying to get a deal done, to no avail. And then, over a decade later the league comes to them and says hey, wanna move to L.A.? We're gonna get two guys in there and we want you to be one. What else would you say if you were in spanos' shoes other then fucking right I want in, this city is never gonna help and I'm sick of trying so hard and spending so much money in vain.   Then the city does begin to try, but only because they're afraid they'll lose the team they've been ignoring for over a decade. So they go to said team and try play nice but the teams spent a decade listening to this shit and believes none of it so plays along, all the while getting L.A. set up.   There is nobody not to blame in this clusterfuck. The city have fucked up, the team fucked up. Everyone has come out of this covered in shit. It just makes no sense to dump on the team for doing what's in their best interests after a decade of trying to make it work, when the city has spent the whole time doing what was in their best interests ie spending the money elsewhere.   Small market teams will always have to be subsidized by the city they're in to stay, especially when there's a massive market on their doorstep that's untapped. But until this year the city wasn't willing to even countenance that notion. They've held the chargers at arms length and told them go fuck yourself for a decade. And the teams never had an option but to take it. Now they do and they're doing to the city whats been done to them. It's shit. But that's the game they played. And they've not played it very well unfortunately."
Chargers,3a7qtg,theoriginalfathead,2,Thu Jun 18 20:21:34 2015 UTC,"Every proposal they came up with was passed on by those in the political sphere, why?    Because we were fucking broke (and still are)?"

Chargers,3a7qtg,theoriginalfathead,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:48:56 2015 UTC,But to reiterate. This isnt really about finding a stadium I don't think. It's about being able to  fund a competitive team in SD  with two teams in la. And I don't think the chargers think that's possible. Which is why they've made the decisions they've made.
Chargers,3a7qtg,theoriginalfathead,-9,Thu Jun 18 21:53:08 2015 UTC,"And it's this sentiment that will lose the chargers. Even if he could afford a stadium on his own, he can't, you expect him to plop one down here or someplace that can see this as a joint business investment?"

There have been numerous studies and reports done and at this point if anyone is saying that Qualcomm is not a viable location then they are most likely a shill for Spanos/Fabiani. All evidence has been to the contrary and anything else you hear spewed out by asshats on the radio is probably not accurate."
Chargers,3a7qtg,esoteryk,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:03:05 2015 UTC,"while the 500 mil may be an exaggeration, it's still a concern when everyone here scoffs at anything over a billion and that obviously makes Carson look a lot better"

Chargers,3a7qtg,BoiseNTheHood,0,Thu Jun 18 17:27:51 2015 UTC,I have a strong distrust in government and this task force has done nothing that the chargers haven't done a decade ago already. They would've moved already if that was the case. I can predict and can understand what a private business is trying to do vs the ineptitude and bureaucracy of government.
Chargers,3a7qtg,I_AM_METALUNA,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:34:40 2015 UTC,"I also distrust the government, but this is the first city government in a long time that has had the drive and the resources to do anything about the stadium issue, and the Chargers have responded with more of the same.  Same excuses, same lies, same nitpicking, same refusal to hold up their end of the bargain or negotiate in good faith.  If you don't see at this point that the Chargers are the villains here, I don't know what to tell you.  The ""they would have moved by now"" argument isn't particularly compelling, because there hasn't been a real opportunity in LA until recently."
Chargers,3a7qtg,BoiseNTheHood,0,Thu Jun 18 17:44:09 2015 UTC,They put the task force together and all they did was waste time coming to the same damn conclusions while knowing there was a looming deadline. Too little too late.

But as an ex-resident of San Diego and current resident of Los Angeles, now you've alienated me as well. I was actually in a position where this could have been a win/win for me. Now it's just turning into a lose/lose."
Chargers,3a7qtg,AndyofBorg,4,Wed Jun 17 23:18:46 2015 UTC,"It's greed and playing the the Charger faithful.  Why throw away selling tickets this season by being honest and telling the city they are moving no matter what, when they can string along the fans who for some reason still trust the Spanos family. Who buy tickets this season hoping it will somehow swing the chargers back to the table, when all they can see is the green of being the 8th fiddle in LA."
Chargers,3a7qtg,PsychicWarElephant,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:13:45 2015 UTC,"all they can see is the green of being the 8th fiddle in LA   That's the thing. It just seems so odd to me that you would leave a city where you're essentially the sports team that everyone supports to a city that prefers two other teams in your same sport over you. (I know, money, I'm just skeptical that they'll have the fanbase – read: cashflow – that they're expecting.)  Forget about the Dodgers, Angels, Kings, Clippers, Lakers (well, that one isn't tough), Galaxy, and any other sports teams, you still have to contend with the Raiders and the fact that LA wishes the Rams would move their instead of the Chargers."

This would of worked several years back when SD was actually pussyfooting around the whole stadium issue, but not now.  I've seen the mayor and his people work hard for this in the face of other issues that the city is facing. He didn't have to, he knows how much this team means to a lot of us.   In the end, if they move, I hope that Charger fans are smart enough to see this."
Chargers,3a7qtg,impactblue5,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:13:08 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Faulconer's only been in office for just over a year and he's done more for this stadium issue than the previous 3 elected mayors did in their terms.  Dean says he wants to stay and he's presented with a way to do that but he doesn't want to take it, because, really, it's, ""We want to stay, but only if it's Downtown or we going to LA.""   That's greed and extortion. Fuck them."
Chargers,3a7qtg,ace-destrier,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:35:59 2015 UTC,"The timeline as I understand it is something like this:   City is broke, delays things as long as they can Chargers decide to move to LA, make credible motions towards that goal. SD throws caution to the wind and puts pedal to the metal to get a viable plan done yesterday Chargers claim they want to continue to play in San Diego, while torpedoing everything the City & County come up with."
Chargers,3a7qtg,MuaddibMcFly,14,Thu Jun 18 21:40:09 2015 UTC,"So the question for Chargers fans becomes, how much should we care about the team this year?? It's not an easy one to answer for me. On the one hand, of course we love our players and they are free of blame in all of this, but how can we willingly go out there and support this organization when the owners and spokesmen for the team have been so completely disingenuous?

Back when news first broke I put my authentic game jersey in a box and shipped it to Spanos. Never heard back but his personal assistant signed for it so at least I know his office got my personal ""Fuck You!""  They weren't taking this shit seriously at any point. They've been getting such a sweetheart deal all these years that they would still say ""No"" even if San Diego covered the entire expense of a new stadium... Spanos could never afford the rent.

Toni Atkins, the Assembly Speaker from San Diego has said she can deliver a Legislative exemption for this project if the City and Chargers can agree to terms.  Why is the City pushing a dubious EIR strategy if there is a clear cut legislative solution to this issue?  The Chargers cannot agree to such a strategy because when the deal gets tied up in court, they'll be shit outta luck.

I think that's an over estimate but with the Carson site having 2 teams and all the ""bells and whistles"" you can see why Goldman Sachs are not willing to back it versus 2 billion here with a lot smaller chance of a value up-tick"
Chargers,3a7qtg,anoff,2,Thu Jun 18 16:56:06 2015 UTC,"Yet they're totally cool with being responsible for $7-900mil to finance the Carson deal...how can they have the money to spend up there, but not down here?  Yes, I know the actual cash is being put up by Goldman, but they're basically borrowing it from them, and they could do the same down here.  Either way, owning a stadium is a losing business, that's why virtually all of the stadiums are owned by cities.  They don't want to own a stadium, and if they end up owning one, they'll be way more broke than they are now.  It's all good though, because they are going to fist themselves when they burn all the bridges down here, and realize that the NFL isn't going to let them slip away to LA.  Kroenke with the Rams can make his deal happen with straight cash-money if he needs to, and once he wins that race to LA, the NFL isn't going to let 2 more teams go there.  Maybe this will be the death knell of the ownership group, and we'll finally get someone that is serious about winning."

My hatred of L.A. comes from my own dealings with that city.   I am glad he's not around for this. After Boot he adopted the city as his own (interestingly he's from St. Louis). He taught me about Don Coryell and Kellen Winslow and Dan Fouts and Gary ""Big Hands"" Johnson (his personal favorite Charger).   I'm sorry to see this team leave because it's a connection to him I had growing up, and watching Charger football gives me a piece of him back.  I don't want to give up our team, but I cannot support an owner that would do this. And I know he wouldn't either."

Chargers,3a84t7,BoiseNTheHood,9,Thu Jun 18 17:29:31 2015 UTC,The Chargers outright lied to San Diego and went behind the cities back to get the Carson initiative off the ground.  If the NFL lets teams act like this and move from their cities they are making a mistake. It might take years for them to learn but that sort of disloyalty to your home town market is bad for business in the long run.
Chargers,3a84t7,tubetop2go,2,Thu Jun 18 02:56:59 2015 UTC,"The NFL doesn't care about San Diego, because the amount of non-native residents is so high, they will still watch their games on TV. so the television market probably won't take a gigantic hit.  Missouri has another team, and Raider fans are too stupid to not support the team even after they have moved back and forth so many times over the years."

Toni Atkins, the Assembly Speaker from San Diego has said that she can deliver a legislative exemption at the State level for CEQA on this project.  http://timesofsandiego.com/politics/2015/05/18/atkins-sacramento-would-help-keep-chargers-in-s-d/  A month ago she said this.  This would eliminate the entire problem with environmental impact and take away legal challenge vulnerability from the ballot measure.  The fact that the City has chosen to roll out a 30 year old EIR and expect the Chargers to jump on board, shows that it is in fact the City and not the Chargers who are playing games.  How can the Chargers afford to sign on with this dubious EIR plan?  When the legal challenges come, they are screwed.  If the City pushed the CEQA exemption from the State, and the Chargers weren't interested, that's another story."

Chargers,3a7ufq,TweetPoster,2,Wed Jun 17 22:26:42 2015 UTC,"I heard on NFLRadio on SiriusXM that the City's next step is to talk with the NFL (probably about the Chargers' obstructionist attitude). We'll see how that goes. If it's like a schoolyard kid tattling on a bully, it won't go well; but if it's more detailed and shows multiple instances in detail about how the Chargers would done nothing but put up roadblocks, then it might end up helping the City's case."

Chargers,3a6nr8,MarcoCheng,12,Wed Jun 17 17:24:01 2015 UTC,"I don't necessarily agree or disagree with this idea, I'm more intrigued by it. You'll be exchanging Weddle (who is on the north side of 30) for a young and 2x All-Pro d-lineman who can immediately help out the front seven. The Chargers can also afford a big contract for him after the 2015 season  What do you guys think?"
Chargers,3a6nr8,tommygun1411,2,Wed Jun 17 17:28:40 2015 UTC,"from the comments section of the article:   ""1) The Jets have Calvin Pryor (who they just drafted and are high on) and Marcus Gilchrist (whom they gave a ton of money to) as the safeties  2) Neither safety are players the team wants to move to the bench  3) Gilchrist can’t move to CB as they are completely full  4) How full? Their 2013 first rounder might not make the team because they’re so loaded  5) They’re overloaded especially salary wise at DB"""
Chargers,3a6nr8,Bsul21,2,Wed Jun 17 17:54:46 2015 UTC,"But, Pryor was pretty awful last year, and Gilchrist is awful, you'd think Weddle, especially when paired with Revis, Cro, and Skrine, would be a massive immediate upgrade while they let Pryor develop."

Chargers,3a6nr8,bdubbz14,6,Wed Jun 17 18:48:45 2015 UTC,"I would do it without a second thought...Mo Wilk is young and in his prime at a massive position of need.  Liuget and Wilk on the same line....RIP Peyton   Edit: the trade makes no sense from the Jets side of it, so why not throw in next year's 4th? Lmao"
Chargers,3a6nr8,Orgasmo3000,3,Wed Jun 17 17:37:50 2015 UTC,Chargers could do a lot worse than replacing one All-Pro with another.
Chargers,3a6nr8,HeavensentLXXI,2,Wed Jun 17 18:00:36 2015 UTC,"It's a great idea, but it'd be complex because I think both players would be unhappy about the trade initially unless both sides were getting a new deal. For us, that's a no brainer. For the Jets, I'm not sure. They've got a tight cap of about 5m right now. They almost have to sign Weddle long-term to free up money by pushing it to the future and that is just as risky for them with a player his age as it is for us. They have bigger needs then on that monster secondary.  Furthermore, I don't see the Jets benefiting from this trade as much as we do. Weddle is a older with a lot of miles on his legs. There'd be a lot to like about having Weddle join Cromartie and Revis in that secondary, but I feel like Calvin Pryor is too raw to see his full potential. They may be happy enough with his progress this offseason, but it's also likely they might like to bench him and let Weddle groom him. Who can say?  From our side though, sure, bring it on and make the trade. We win big time."
Chargers,3a6nr8,highastronaut,2,Wed Jun 17 18:32:22 2015 UTC,The jets wouldn't do this
Chargers,3a6nr8,Pleasuresaurus_Sex,2,Wed Jun 17 19:17:19 2015 UTC,Wouldn't make sense for them to do but it would be a terrifying thought to have the already stacked Jets secondary adding Weddle. Wilkerson would improve our defense immensely tho

Chargers,3a2wvg,Orgasmo3000,34,Tue Jun 16 20:24:19 2015 UTC,"Clearly an attempt to pressure...in my opinion this is a technique used when they feel they don't have the strength or true leverage. If you are worth the money you are asking for, sit back and let the offers come in when you are a free agent. The timing is not right for him however, as we have him this year and can tag him next year if we wanted, which means we are going to get the entire peak play of his career and at that point will he be worth this money he is asking for as he will be what 33 or so? I love Weddle, but I can see what his agent is trying to avoid here and I can also see why the Chargers aren't running to extend him on a monster deal at this time."
Chargers,3a2wvg,latebraker,5,Tue Jun 16 20:35:28 2015 UTC,"I see it as in part so he can just focus on playing football once training camp starts, because after that there aren't any breaks until the end of the season. He doesn't want contract stuff distracting him. Someone will pay him next year. Even if the Chargers tag him, that gets him a big chunk of money for 2016. He gets 120% of his salary for this year instead of the average of the top 5 if we tag him, as he's the highest paid safety for this year. And that 120% keeps him as the highest paid safety."
Chargers,3a2wvg,BJEdwards,2,Tue Jun 16 21:16:22 2015 UTC,"I don't think that is the motive as they really don't do many if any contracts during the season, I think they are basically saying do it now or it's your last chance. Again, I love Weddle, I think his agent is trying to avoid going to free agency or being tagged at 32 years old and then hitting the market. From an organization standpoint I can see why the Chargers are doing what they are doing and from Weddles standpoint I can see why him and his agent are doing what they are doing. I think if Weddle was 27 this deal would be getting done."
Chargers,3a2wvg,latebraker,3,Tue Jun 16 22:23:59 2015 UTC,"I think they are basically saying do it now or it's your last chance.   I agree that's the message they're trying to convey, but I don't think it really is the last chance. If Telesco does end up offering a deal close enough to what Weddle wants, why would he leave? Just because the deal didn't come ~8 months earlier?   Although, I think the team's stance does indicate Telesco is willing to let Weddle hit the open market, and that he probably won't offer Weddle what he wants. If we're lucky, the only teams offering Weddle a deal significantly better than us aren't contenders, which could help help him stay, but I don't think that's likely."
Chargers,3a2wvg,BJEdwards,6,Tue Jun 16 22:40:11 2015 UTC,"I just listened to Weddle's conference, he directly said when asked the question if they give him a deal next year he said his response would be no. Pretty brutal. He is clearly past the hurt stage and is now pissed off and jaded. Mentioned several times that his age was brought up and that he has played a lot of plays etc...I can see why he is pissed off and maybe feels disrespected that they are acting like he is over the hill or whatever. Unfortunately with guys like him though they feel they are as good as they ever were for sometimes longer than they are. Not saying he isn't, but we are getting close when he is going to start losing a step here or there and for the Chargers to basically have him for the next 2 seasons for sure I can see why they are laying off. Sucks though, but if you were in their shoes as the GM would you sign him to a 5 year deal right now knowing you have him for the next 2 for sure?"
Chargers,3a2wvg,latebraker,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:51:47 2015 UTC,Unless we franchise Rivers then we only have him for one. :(
Chargers,3a2wvg,crustycupcakes,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:18:47 2015 UTC,"Apparently they haven't even offered him a contract or even talked about money, so even though he might be expecting a good amount of money I'm kinda on his side of this right now."
Chargers,3a2wvg,mhazheer,8,Tue Jun 16 21:48:17 2015 UTC,"I don't buy all of what he said. I don't think it's ""obvious"" at all. It's complicated. He's a top 5 safety but on the north side of 30. He should get what he's worth (which would be an increase on the $8mil/year base pay, and he does deserve it) but he wants to play less. They're also still working on Rivers, who justifiably should take precedent over Weddle, but I don't think they've completely pushed Weddle aside, either.  There would have to be more to this if the Chargers have already determined that they don't want Weddle long-term. It'd be understandable if he was declining like Polamalu did, but he hasn't. He's in Pro-Bowl form. Doesn't make sense to me that the FO has decided, ""We don't want this Pro-Bowl, long-time Charger, defensive leader anymore."""
Chargers,3a2wvg,ace-destrier,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:23:21 2015 UTC,"It does if you buy the argument that the FO sides hard with the Head Coach and anyone who possibly has clout with the players (i.e. any veteran players who were here pre-TT/McCoy) could be considered ""dangerous"" per the morale of the team going forward."

Chargers,3a2wvg,fl1ntfl0ssy,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:15:04 2015 UTC,"Me either.  But... His captaincy on special teams has involved him making the call to go against McCoy's decision and fake a punt on two occasions so far. I have absolutely no problem with either call (even if the one in the Raiders game wasn't exactly do or die at the time) but I could see a total regressive control freak like McCoy, now that he has ground to stand on and not as great a ""need"" for veterans players to lead (and, you know, yell at him not to throw challenge flags at the wrong time), looking to eliminate anyone who could pose a ""threat"" to his total control of the team."

Chargers,3a2wvg,Smash_Things,11,Tue Jun 16 20:40:27 2015 UTC,"Because he's under contract...and then bitched about it...and made it public. Most contracts happen like it did with Flowers and Dunlap. Don't let them get to FA, but the season is done. He should know this by now. Pretty sure that's how his last contract was like that too I think."
Chargers,3a2wvg,BobTaco,-2,Tue Jun 16 21:30:46 2015 UTC,"He didn't bitch about it though, the Chargers are the ones that lied to the media about not meeting his numbers. Watch the presser when it's up"
Chargers,3a2wvg,Smash_Things,5,Tue Jun 16 22:08:18 2015 UTC,I will watch it eventually. But he complained a lot...we'll see. :-P
Chargers,3a2wvg,BobTaco,2,Tue Jun 16 22:14:11 2015 UTC,"I'd consider what he said back in April to be bitching. That was the period of time leading up to the draft, which was more dramatic for us more than usual. So I think the FO was massively focused on that, which is probably why they held off on talking to him. And if anything, I would be glad they did if I were him. I wouldn't want them half-ass working with me on a deal if they were concerned about the draft, which was compounded by the Rivers drama."
Chargers,3a2wvg,ace-destrier,9,Tue Jun 16 22:29:19 2015 UTC,"He isn't even looking for top money   Unless I missed something, how do you know this?    Poor guy   Really? The guy is getting paid 10 million a year. I mean, deservedly but he's hardly a target for pity. Perhaps if he would have handled the public aspect of this a bit more professionally, he might have more sympathy from me, but as it stands right now, he's being rather immature. This is how many teams operate. You are merely a cog in the machine, able to be replaced at any moment. You do not make the team, you make up a part of the team. Stop grandstanding."
Chargers,3a2wvg,sounddude,3,Wed Jun 17 00:48:13 2015 UTC,You should watch the press conference. He hasn't said anything to the media and the opposite has been let out there.   He said in it he would take a pay cut I'm terms of an extension for a team friendly deal.   You could tell he was getting emotional reading his statement. He wants nothing but to retire a charger
Chargers,3a2wvg,Smash_Things,3,Wed Jun 17 00:59:45 2015 UTC,"So why issue an ultimatum with an entire year left to play on your contract? Im sure he is honest in his desire to finish in the powder blues, but why issue such strong language so early on? If they don't want you, you'll find a team that will. The whole thing sounds suspicious IMO."
Chargers,3a2wvg,sounddude,3,Wed Jun 17 01:40:16 2015 UTC,"Where's a vid at?   I've been supportive of Weddle 100% throughout this whole thing, I think the FO is dumb as hell for not offering the two best players on the team contract extensions, but after considering the fact that we could just use the tag on Eric next year. I know he may not be looking for top top money but he will be on the wrong side of 30 after this season and wants a fat check, I understand the FO's hesitation to extend now."

The way is see it Eric Weddle is basically locked down until after the end of next season, no way the FO gets pushed into a situation where they would have to use the tag on Phil, I think he gets a deal done for sure."

He wants to ""stay a Charger for life"" but throws a bitch fit when they don't pay him EVEN MORE money than he's already making.  No home team discount?  For the team you supposedly love so much?

I can see the city going ahead with the vote anyways. Let the Spanos family and the NFL move the team after the city has had its say. Either the city votes against a stadium and the team is just as gone as they already would be, or the city votes for a stadium and they have to deal with pulling out from a city that put forward a stadium plan and voted for it."

It's a ploy to milk as much money as possible from the city through a ridiculous contract where we are basically paying them to play here, until they could find a financially viable plan for LA.

Only other team in S.D. are the Padres.  If people wanted to choose which team to cheer for between those two, most San Diegans would most likely pick the Chargers.  This is most likely very much tied with what's going on in St Louis.  I think Kroenke will most likely get his stadium in S.L.  He has all the power there.  Once he gets it, he can turn his land in Hollywood into a slum like all his other properties.  I wonder what the Spanos would do if San Diego just told them, ""let's wait and see what happens in St. Louis before we talk.""  Kind of like Oakland.  They flat out told the Raiders no.  Raiders have no leverage there except if Carson or Inglewood goes through."

It should be all but certain that the Chargers are moving to LA right around the time pre-season rolls around. It's going to be six months of hammering Spanos and the Chargers for leaving when a deal was close. The Chargers were only being polite when it didn't seem like a new stadium deal was possible in SD.

He is older, and the risk-reward evaluation isn't as easy as it was four years ago.   I appreciate hearing from Weddle directly. Sad he feels the way he does.

Chargers,3a3ik5,esoteryk,2,Wed Jun 17 15:37:12 2015 UTC,"The issue is that the NFL wants downtown too. And they decide what ""good faith"" is. Totally rigged against SD."
Chargers,3a3ik5,BobTaco,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:14:17 2015 UTC,"Chargers dragging their feet? I disagree. The chargers are up against a wall and have been looking for locations around San Diego for 12 years. When the sentiment of the town is, ""they don't need all the bells and whistles"", and they're suck with mission valley solution that will need a chunk of funding to go to nothing but raising the land, I can see how they are fed up with this city."
Chargers,3a3ik5,I_AM_METALUNA,2,Thu Jun 18 00:10:20 2015 UTC,The first mayor in 14 years who wants to make stuff work...and the Chargers throw as much debris in his way as possible to cockblock him. Keep in mind that SD is finally out of the econ crash of 2008. This is literally the first opportunity to even contemplate a new stadium in years. They could at least act like they figiveve a damn.
Chargers,3a3ik5,BobTaco,-1,Thu Jun 18 00:23:17 2015 UTC,"that coupled with the possible moves of other teams and the sentiment of this town I mentioned are creating a time crunch. The city is the one that needs to make moves fast, the chargers have been looking at every option here and they're isn't anything more for them to do other than protect their future here or elsewhere."
Chargers,3a3ik5,I_AM_METALUNA,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:32:57 2015 UTC,"The issue is that they aren't even trying to protect their future in SD. They aren't even looking at SD. They at limp for SD, and hard for LA...which is why they are dragging their feet with SD. They couldn't give two shit atm."
Chargers,3a3ik5,BobTaco,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:40:15 2015 UTC,They've looked at sd options for over a decade and they're back to square one. If the downtown option had more (any) support they'd be singing a different tune. I think we could've copied what Seattle did downtown and it could have worked will for us and the team. Bring in the mls and have a place for the stones ti sell out rather than overflow petco.
Chargers,3a3ik5,I_AM_METALUNA,2,Thu Jun 18 00:46:28 2015 UTC,Not when everything was due in less than a year. The Chargers killed that option themselves by forcing the time table on the city. Sucks for them.

Chargers,3a3ik5,I_AM_METALUNA,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:16:49 2015 UTC,"You clearly don't know anything about eminent domain and infrastructure projects. Eminent domain alone can take years to resolve in court. And land relinquishments don't just happen in a matter of hours or even days. That takes months if everyone is cooperative. Then there's the issue of environmental studies because there is now a stadium where there wasn't one before. That'll take 2 years alone. Breaking ground would happen in 5 years if we are talking about the most optimistic timeline imaginable. 2 years to demolish/build. 7 years from now there would be a stadium if you exclude any lawsuits (there are always lawsuits) that may prevent it from even getting started past the acquisitions phase. 10 years is more likely because that's how long it took Petco, and it's going in a very similar area.  Doesn't even come close to the Charger's timeline."
Chargers,3a3ik5,BobTaco,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:03:42 2015 UTC,Should've been done earlier and that's why downtown is out. I realize that. I was under the impression that a deadline on a vote on mission valley is what they were taking about and if so then San Diego is too late as this should've been addressed long ago.

And here's a valid rebuttal to those concerns.  I think it's become clear that the Chargers don't want to stay in San Diego, but are too chickenshit to admit it."
Chargers,3a3ik5,EasilyAnnoyed,3,Wed Jun 17 05:00:27 2015 UTC,"It's brilliant actually. They obviously want us to spend money on tickets this season, if they said they were moving, along with the no black out rules, that stadium might as well have the visiting teams logos because it sure wouldn't be a home game. I won't give them a penny until they say something positive towards staying and they haven't made me open my wallet yet."
Chargers,3a3ik5,PsychicWarElephant,2,Wed Jun 17 15:48:00 2015 UTC,Yup I agree. It's a pity they're using the LT Jersey retirement to try and milk the fans for everything they're worth before leaving town.

Spanos' net worth is supposed to be mostly from the value of the Chargers, with the rest being what he's willing to put up for getting a stadium built. It's why he wants a new stadium in the first place. Suite money stays with the team, so better suites gets Spanos more money, which can go to better, or just newer, equipment.  But yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if Perryman is breaking some of the old equipment."

Unfortunately there is not an abundance of clarity in that article about the Chargers ownership and legal team that they are leaving for me to feel that they do not want to be in San Diego.  There is not a single quote from those parties in that article, just from the other side.  Because of the ongoing negotiations why would the mayor give any leeway to Bolts owners/lawyers?  That would be counter productive to his popularity, which is all that he cares about."

The only time it will be clear they are leaving is Jan. 1 to Feb. 15 when teams have to declare if they intend to move.  So at the moment everyone who says they are leaving is just making a prediction based off of the way the Chargers do business.

I do see this as a make or  break draft for Telesco though.  Because he seemed to deviate so far from conventional wisdom with some of the high picks and the overall approach to the draft, I think there is a lot of risk for him.  If these players largely turn out to be a success, Telesco will look like a genius.  If these guys turn out to be mostly busts, this is the kind of draft that can get you fired a year or two down the line.  Time will tell."

Every single player was broken last year, Philip fucked his back and was being held together by magic glue (which didn't work), the  o line fell apart after our hundredth centre had to come in, our two starting cbs (verrett and flowers) were both crocked for half the season, our brightest pass rusher missed half the year, our running back (who our ball control offence was built around) broke down again and our third down back also went the way of ir.

They told me I could take the $1002 I had ""in my account"" and get cheaper season tickets.   I told them after being in Plaza for 10 years, there was no way that I was going to be stuck in upper view or View East Endzone.  I called a few times in hopes that maybe I could get someone more sympathetic, but they pretty much told me to pound sand.  I even asked if I could use the $1002 I had in my account to just buy ~9 single game seats to one game, they told me this was not an option either... it was full season or nothing.  I made the decision to just pay off the seats and I was going to try to sell them via the secondary market once the season gets around.    I saw that the Chargers today announced that single games will be likely be more expensive so I figured I'd give the Brochados a chance to get in at the season ticket price.  http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2015/jun/16/chargers-steelers-tickets-nfl-stubhub/"

Chargers,39z74n,when_did_i_eat_corn,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:38:12 2015 UTC,"I consider Reich to be in the Jon Pagano situation last year or the year before.  Sure he was bad, but when you get decimated with injuries like that, you seriously can't gameplan for it (pags starting the 5th/6th OLB's, Reich picking up a C off the street and playing him every other week).  Especially when you're missing the guy who makes all the calls up front, and having to put in a guy who has no knowledge of the offensive scheme and having to start him (legursky, Robinson) a week later.  That SEVERELY limits what you can do on offense.  Then you throw in that the QB is playing with a bulging disk (potentially causing some nerve problems elsewhere), and you're completely screwed.  Throw in starting your 3rd string RB just for good measure to ensure that we're not gonna have an offense.  The point is, you can only game-plan/play-call around so much variability before things start to fall apart.    Face it, this team is going to be conservative, we have a HC who learned everything from the most conservative of the coservative HC's (John Fox).  It can work when you have the right team built around it, and a QB that can step up when needed.  The work that TT has put in this offeseason has really set this team up so we can succeed.  We have all the pieces we need on the OL, and should have a dominant running game, and that is what our whole offense will base itself around.  Think of what the seahawks do, but with a better quick passing game.  Thats what we're ideally going for.  But essentially, give Reich another year before he gets trashed. We saw how good Pags was for most of this year as a DC, after everyone wanting him out the year before.  Sometimes the coaches take the blame for not having the talent available to them.  Reich has all the pieces he could want this year, and has a years exp with play calling, if he fails this year without lots of major injuries, that is when i'll start to be concerned about him."

It's not a perfect system, especially for really multi-faceted guys like TE's, FB's, or WR's who do a lot of blocking, and who have to be good at a lot.  Green also has a pretty small sample size.

They don't take into account play time, they don't take into account the attention that a player gets.  Its if he beat his man or not.  Gates usually had 2 guys on him and was bracketed in coverage allowing for Green when he was in to get better matchups, and 1 on 1 matchups with a S or LBer.  PFF gives the same grade for Green beating a LB in coverage to Gates beating a double team...its dumb"
Chargers,39xro4,Duffman5755,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:12:38 2015 UTC,"PFF rates receivers primarily on yards produced per target, not overall statistical output.

Chargers,39xro4,ace-destrier,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:09:01 2015 UTC,TE E. Frohnapfel. I wanna see that name on a jersey on the field and I want announcers to say that name. FS J. Lowdermilk too.

Chargers,39vl4j,tstscavo,20,Mon Jun 15 03:57:16 2015 UTC,"I was really happy with the draft. I was initially upset the we didn't try to add depth to our offensive line, but I think Telesco was able to solve that problem in free agency.   I'm really excited about Perryman, that guy is so explosive. I want to see what he can do in the NFL... Mager might have been a reach in the 3rd round, but without a 4th round pick they had to go for who they wanted. Mager looked good on tape and with Flowers and Verrett he won't have a lot of pressure to perform/start.   Kyle Emmanuel knows how to win and lead. He's captained 2 national championship teams in a row... I know it's not BCS caliber, but having guys that know how to win and lead on a team is good in my opinion.  As for Philon in the 6th, probably a good pick. The 6th/7th is a good place to take a chance. There are some concerns with his size, but I think adding depth and potential playmakers to our D-line is smart."
Chargers,39vl4j,tommygun1411,3,Mon Jun 15 04:21:51 2015 UTC,"Kyle was on the South Dakota team for 4 national championships in a row and then captain for the last two. Crazy  Also, he won his conference's Defense Player of the Year Award last year too"
Chargers,39vl4j,Smash_Things,2,Mon Jun 15 16:02:41 2015 UTC,"Emmanuel was drafted out of North Dakota, from NDSU.   It was a (not really) big deal here. It would've been bigger if he was drafted by the Vikings. Still, I'm looking forward to what he will accomplish with the Chargers."

Chargers,39vl4j,LukeNeverShaves,-2,Mon Jun 15 17:34:41 2015 UTC,"Perryman, the special teams man?  Hope to see him more than every second game."
Chargers,39vl4j,PragmaticUncle,9,Mon Jun 15 14:51:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, overall I'm pretty pleased with this draft.  I wasn't a fan of the MGIII pick, but that didn't really have anything to do with him as a player.  I think with a good enough OL, the difference you're going to see from a first round RB, to a RB in the 2-4th rounds, especially in this class of good backs, is really small IMO.  Weirdly enough he actually reminds me of DeMarco Murray coming out of the draft, minus the injury issues and plus production.  Now Murray added 20 lbs and completely changed his running style with the 'boys, but I could see the same type of production (no like his production last year with his stupid good OL, but overall really solid production if he doesn't see injuries, since that's his biggest downfall, and MGIII hasn't really had injury problems) especially with how we've build our OL around guys with pure power.  Perryman was an interesting pick, and i'm not sure about what this pick means.  Are we going to play a 3 off ball LB base, with Perryman as the MLB, and Butler as the Will with Te'o as the Sam?  Are we not confident in one of Te'o/Butler.  All the reports have been that we're going to run a Seahawks-like defense, where the SOLB is a perfect fit for Melvin Ingram, especially now that he's dropped 20lbs, so this is more of a confusing pick as to where he fits in rather than talent.  But my hope is that new LB coach Mike Nolan was pounding the table for this guy when he was there in the 2nd.  Nolan is known for coaching really aggressive players, especially at ILB (he drafted/signed Lewis/Suggs/ in Bal, Willis/Justin Smith in SF etc).  So I'm hoping this is more of a shift in mentality/BPA pick than a need pick, which I could definitely deal with.  Craig Mager was actually a guy i have liked for a while. He's a freakish athlete, who is physical as all hell and is great at off man type coverages, which is what we play almost exclusively.  He's the guy who's going to work harder than anyone else in the room (from scouts words/impressions of him), and thats gonna set him apart.  He reminds me a little bit of Charles Gaines from last year.  Didn't go to as big of a school, so he didn't get the same hype, and didn't time quite as fast in the pure speed drills.  But he did look better on the explosion drills, which translates well to off man coverage.  He's a bit of a project, and you're going to have to teach him how to read the game, and get him up to NFL speed, but I think he can be very good, and he could come on and play well later in the year as a 3rd CB (bumping Flowers/Verrett to the slot).  He's also a big corner who's just over 5'11 1/2"" (so id give him 6') and 201 lbs, which is definitely big for a corner.  Kyle Emmanuel could be solid.  I don't think I see anything special necessarily out of him, but I think he can be a solid backup, especially in that 9 Technique ""Leo"" position that the Seahawks D uses (that we're reportedly moving towards, which bodes well for Attaochu who is the absolute IDEAL player for that spot).  He's a good pass rusher, but he's short (length wise w/ 31"" arms) and doesn't have any real elite traits other than his motor.  I was praying Davis Tull dropped to us (I think he's going to be special if he plays in that Leo spot), but Emmanual is a good poor-mans version of him IMO.  Philon is interesting.  Dude has a crazy motor, and when hes comming off the snap, he's coming at you HARD.  He'd be an awesome situational penetrating type if we wanted to use him that way.  He's perfect to sit and learn for a few years behind Liuget, because he needs to add some functional strength.  When he doesn't penetrate, he gets eaten up pretty quick.  He's got work to do, which is why he fell pretty far down, but he's got the potential and play-style to be as good as any 3 technique type player picked outside the first round this year.  Heck he won't turn 22 until basically the end of the season next year, so he's got time to figure it out, but like I said before, he absolutely has work to do on handwork, bulking up/getting more physical and figuring out how to win at the POA."
Chargers,39vl4j,Duffman5755,3,Mon Jun 15 04:59:50 2015 UTC,"I haven't really read up on it much, but from your write up it sounds like Mager could end up a bit like Jammer? They're around the same size as well, right?"

Let's hope he's half the LB Seau was! I'm on that Gordon/Perryman hype train! I drank the kool-aid boys and it's delicious!"
Chargers,39vl4j,crustycupcakes,5,Mon Jun 15 16:40:26 2015 UTC,"I obviously cannot speak for everyone in this sub, but I was somewhat pleased with this draft. Other than Melvin Gordon, we only got 4 other players: Denzel Perryman (ILB) in the 2nd, Craig Mager (CB) in the 3rd, Kyle Emanuel (OLB) in the 5th, and Darius Philon (DE) in the 6th. I definitely would have preferred to get more picks as we have had some serious depth/injury issues. As of right now, I'm feeling sort of torn over the selections of Perryman and Mager. Perryman was probably the BPA at that pick (Randy Gregory/La'el Collins excluded), and he will definitely provide quality depth, but there were other holes that could have been filled. Mager was an absolute question mark for me. I had honestly never heard of the guy before the draft, and corner wasn't really a position of need (Verrett, Flowers, Robinson). I understand that there were some injuries in the secondary last year, but there were some better corners available at that spot (Steven Nelson, etc). Other than those two, I was extremely pleased with the selections of Emanuel and Philon. Both were positions of need and both picks look like they could be steals. Emanuel had a crazy number of sacks last year (19 I think), although not against top competition, and Philon has already gotten some good reviews from minicamp/OTAs. Overall, I am happy with how this draft went after looking at the free agent additions and the pieces already on the roster. There are still some depth needs at OLB and the question mark at SS that could be cause for concern, but apart from that, the Chargers have successfully filled all of their major needs in the offseason."

Chargers,39vl4j,crustycupcakes,2,Tue Jun 16 00:20:40 2015 UTC,"I'm really excited for Denzel Perryman and hopes he sparks a fire in the ILB positional battle. Certainly fits the ""Hammer"" theme.  Craig Mager was an interesting pick that confused a lot of us because we could have probably used help elsewhere and we had lots of secondary focus through free agency. Could pan out well out, but maybe would have preferred another need.  In the FIFTH round we finally addressed some need in our front seven in Kyle Emanuel. Small school guy but seemed to get the job done. Hopefully we see some growth and some action this year but that could be a very optimistic thought.   Holy poop another front seven pick! Darius Philon left college early and is quite small for his position. Despite that I feel this was a pretty good pick and in the future this guy could be something special. Who knows?  Overall I think it was a 'B'ish draft. Wish we would stop trading fourths and a questionable 3rd round pick confused me. Looking forward to seeing these guys in action (maybe, hopefully, idk). I'm not good at analysis but these were my initial thoughts."

Chargers,39vl4j,AnExtraordinaire,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:59:47 2015 UTC,"I haven't heard anything about the Chargers changing defensive philosophies.  Nolan and Pagano are 3-4 defensive coaches. Sure, they may get creative, but only for a few plays per game.   The Chargers did very well with their draft. A running back in the first is always a gamble, but RB was their biggest need. Melvin Gordon should flourish and become a pro bowler quickly. Perryman should've been taken earlier, maybe in the 30's, but he's clearly a BPA.  I see pro bowler in him too, and sure, I'd like to see him at MLB in some sets. Mager is physical and fast. He ran a 4.4 forty and you can't coach speed.  With Shareece Wright gone, he'll take his roster spot, but not his starting stop.  He'll take a couple years to develop. Emmanuel is a great 4th round flyer. Love his potential... Philon has a great opportunity in SD. He could be a steel if he continues to grow and develop.  He's ideal for a DT in the nickel."

No fault of anyone how it shook out, and the organization prioritized the right contracts.

Chargers,39tnsi,ace-destrier,1 point,Sun Jun 14 19:46:07 2015 UTC,"Weddle has been saying they didn't want to offer him a new contract this season.   True but not. The Chargers said it themselves they won't be completing a deal with him this season, and it was only a recent decision.  Since the end of this past season, it was always a priority of the FO to extend Weddle (and Rivers).   Telesco says they did [offer a contract] but Weddle wanted too much money.   Telesco didn't say that, at least not in this article. He said Weddle and Co. presented the numbers and concerns and the FO took all that underconsideration, and on top of their own concerns, the FO couldn't get to the same numbers as Weddle.   I don't think they got to the point of contracts. I don't think Telesco had a contract, gave it to Weddle, and Weddle said, ""Nope.""  You're drawing slightly inaccurate conclusions."
Chargers,39tnsi,DrJoth,1 point,Sun Jun 14 21:32:13 2015 UTC,"I wasn't implying that Telesco said they offered him a contract, just that they wanted to. I mean, you wouldn't sit down in good faith for multiple meetings if you didn't have every intention to offer a contract if negotiations went well and an agreement was reached.  Again, I'm not super up-to-date on the subject but from what I've read it seems like Weddle's statement(s) and Telesco's statement are pretty much contradictory. One of them seems to be lying or misrepresenting what happened. I wish I knew which one."
Chargers,39tnsi,ace-destrier,1 point,Sun Jun 14 23:24:33 2015 UTC,"When you say, ""Weddle has been saying..."" What Weddle statement are you actually referring to?  IIRC, the only actual statement Weddle made was:   ""We've come to them numerous times and said we want to be part of the team, we want to retire as a Charger,"" Weddle said in April. ""We've completely gotten pushed aside.""   (Comments about being ""unhappy"" and feeling ""disrespected"" were also stated.)  At the time, that above statement was true; the team hadn't engaged in talks with him. From then on, his agent, Canter, did some talking, but then they eventually quieted.  June 1st: Canter said the team told him there would be no contract discussions.   June 12th: Telesco explains that the team couldn't agree with Weddle and Canter's numbers. It could be assumed that that confirms Canter's statement. No discussions if the team doesn't want to meet Weddle's numbers.  It doesn't seem like anyone's lying. I guess you could say that Canter could be misrepresenting things. He makes it seem like the Chargers simply refuse to extend Weddle, flat out saying that he ""isn't wanted."" I don't buy that for a second. Only a complete moron wouldn't want Weddle; I don't believe the Chargers are complete morons.  I don't see any contradiction in statements, though. Maybe I'm missing something.  ETA: If you've read stuff by Acee, that could contribute to contradiction because he claims that the sides never talked numbers. It's Acee though. He's rubbish."
Chargers,39tnsi,boltsteve,8,Mon Jun 15 03:41:37 2015 UTC,"Weddle's agent is the one giving bad advice to Eric and is also the one who is bad mouthing the organization. Hopefully Weddle can recognize that the Chargers want him but that there is a process to the whole thing. They have cap room to afford him this year and into the future but when you have a franchise QB who is also negotiating he is going to be a priority over a safety. Regardless of how good your safety is, a QB of Rivers' caliber is more important."
Chargers,39tnsi,ace-destrier,6,Mon Jun 15 02:04:56 2015 UTC,"David Canter (Weddle's agent) did good work to get Weddle that $40mil deal years ago, but he has been so sloppy lately. Not long ago, he thought he was making a personal post on his twitter but posted through Weddle's instead. And his twitter itself is pretty bad. His comments to articles regarding Weddle and continued badmouthing of the organization are embarrassing."
Chargers,39tnsi,boltsteve,1 point,Mon Jun 15 03:59:25 2015 UTC,"I'm wondering how much Canter did 5 years ago to get that deal for Weddle versus AJ throwing money around trying to save his job. It ended up being worthwhile for the Chargers as he has been awesome, but I'm thinking it was more AJ guessing than a shrewd negotiation by Weddle's agent.  According to wikipedia, Weddle is the only big time player that Canter has in his portfolio so I'm not surprised he makes these kinds of mistakes. I'm hoping that saner heads will prevail and Weddle will see that the Chargers want him to stick around."
Chargers,39tnsi,ace-destrier,2,Mon Jun 15 21:41:36 2015 UTC,"You make a very good point re: AJ or Canter. I might've given Canter too much credit. I gladly take it back.  Weddle said he'd like to retire a Charger. If that was as important to him as something like that is, then I wish he would be more understanding and not believe the delusions Canter's feeding him. Weddle's remarks about being pushed aside and feeling disrespected sound like Canter's words coming out of his mouth. Canter's influenced him into prioritizing big pay day vs. being a lifetime Charger, makes sense since Weddle's his cash cow. It's disappointing."

Chargers,39uqxb,Orgasmo3000,3,Mon Jun 15 17:42:24 2015 UTC,"I see us as definitely more likely in trying to get a Rivers extension at some point this year (perhaps with a better understanding of the stadium situation in a few months), and if we want to keep Weddle for [roughly] the price he's asking, we can do it short-term next year with a tag - incurring minimal risk compared with a long-term, high value contract.  If we don't tag him, we could also conceivably negotiate with Weddle with a little more leverage at the end of this season, considering last year will likely be difficult for him to top."
Chargers,39uqxb,TheFakeTomTelesco,2,Mon Jun 15 18:15:12 2015 UTC,I think that would be smart. Safeties degrade fast (normally). This would make sure they wouldn't be stuck with Weddle if he starts to decline.
Chargers,39uqxb,BobTaco,4,Mon Jun 15 18:36:10 2015 UTC,"Completely agree.  Him being a good person in the community is all well and good and perhaps marginally impacts what you're willing to pay him, but ultimately it comes down to production.  I would guess that Telesco is debating what sort of return Weddle will provide and at what price, not how great of a guy he is.   After an NFL season clouded with domestic violence issues, the Chargers would be wise to extend a contract for not just one of their most talented players, but also one of their most intelligent players. Even from a business perspective, the Chargers would benefit by extending Weddle a contract into retirement because he brings in more fans to the organization. His positive attitude and work ethic alone is so infectious it would help build chemistry around any NFL team. Great chemistry always builds a passionate fan base who will in turn be more willing to spend money on their favorite team.   This paragraph is cringe-worthy.  What basis does the author have for some of the things said here? I find it hard to believe that Weddle is so popular amongst Chargers fans that a significant amount of people would stop buying tickets or being fans just because he signs elsewhere.  He's not Derek Jeter or Kobe Bryant.  Putting out a winning team would seem much more important than having a player like Weddle, so the Chargers must determine if the value he will provide is worthy of the contract he seeks.  And like TheFakeTomTelesco said, how can you say it would be wise to extend someone when you don't know what the price will be? A 5 year-$60M deal probably wouldn't be wise but a 4 year-$30M might be."
Chargers,39uqxb,ChargersChatPodcast,3,Mon Jun 15 22:05:09 2015 UTC,I love the guy and want him to be a Charger until he retires. Hopefully with him at the minicamp and in the building something will get done or at least move a little.
Chargers,39uqxb,boltsteve,2,Mon Jun 15 18:27:14 2015 UTC,"I love him too and wish it hadn't come to this, I don't think we are going to do anything until next year.  If Weddle slips up at all this year I could see him being discarded because of the whining hes been doing this off season, but that's just my opinion"

Like Gwynn, he was just a spectacle to behold on the field, and simply got shit done. Seau, Fouts, Winslow and Alworth are all legends certainly, and Rivers definitely will be when all is said and done, but I think LT is a slight bit above them."
Chargers,39leut,619Haida,3,Fri Jun 12 21:56:44 2015 UTC,Gwynn is known for being a baseball player but he is remembered for the man he was. I think LT is a great person but Gwynn is still leagues ahead of him. LT will be remembered as a football player. I don't think we have an official Mr. Charger yet. I think LT could have locked up that spot if he had been more vocal about keeping the chargers in SD and or community work. Granted AJ let him walk so I don't blame LT for not being as involved when management sucks.

Chargers,39n3x2,Zeshawn,2,Sat Jun 13 01:00:15 2015 UTC,most the teams mentioned are major media markets. Thats just how this stuff goes. its one of the reasons why on espn and nfl network you only really hear stories from these these teams. When you mention a team from a major city or one with a large fan base you get more eyes on your article.
Chargers,39n3x2,clearmindedyou,2,Sat Jun 13 05:33:49 2015 UTC,"Look, I'm usually the first to throw in against the ""The Media Writes Off The Chargers Because Bias And Reasons"" but this is ridiculous.   First, the title and the premise lined up in the first paragraph in the article are TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THINGS. You can have high upside without turnover, or turnover without the potential for high upside, but they don't mean the same fucking thing.  Secondly, like... Hello? Only two starters in name are returning from our secondary last year (Flowers and Weddle) and three/two from the offensive line (Dunlap, Fluker and Troutman... technically... ugh...). If position group upside is what you're looking for, I'm kind of perplexed by how the Pats' total mystery of a secondary can make it, but one that boasts three Pro Bowl DBs (Flowers, Weddle and Robinson) and possibly the best 2nd year DB in Verrett is passed over."
Chargers,39n3x2,B_Sluggin,5,Fri Jun 12 22:41:06 2015 UTC,"I agree with you on the confusion between the title and what the article actually says.  Definitely not Robert Mays's strongest work.  As others have said the markets of the other mentioned teams probably had some influence on his choices.   You're also right that our secondary is setup to be huge next year.  It's likely that because Flowers, Weddle and Verrett all played for us last year that he didn't consider it a high turnover unit.  I wouldn't go too hard on Mays for any anti-Charger bias.  He talks about them all the time on his podcast and has even admitted to the Chargers being one of his favorite non-Bears teams.  Here's a great article he wrote on Weddle a couple of years ago.  On the lighter side he also once picked Phil Rivers over Cam Newton in the final of a hypothetical QB hunger games style tournament."

Chargers,39n3x2,ChargersChatPodcast,1 point,Sat Jun 13 03:52:22 2015 UTC,"Well there were only 6 position groups analyzed here and 32 NFL teams, so I don't think it is such a big deal we weren't discussed.  As far as the title, I think that is typically written by some sort of editor who is not the author of the article.  Here, it appears the title is misleading.  This article isn't about highest upside, but merely some position groups with high turnover.  Our starting secondary doesn't really have a lot of turnover.  Weddle, Flowers, and Verrett were all starters last year (when healthy) and Addae played a lot of snaps when Gilchrist defended the slot.  We will have new SCB but that's not a huge change.  Offensive line wise, the additions of Franklin and Barksdale are significant, but Dunlap, Watt, Fluker, and Troutman are all holdovers from 2014.  If this article covered like 30 position groups, maybe we could have a beef, but otherwise I'm not gonna pull out the pitchforks."

In my opinion Jamal would make our current LBs that much better, but of course they wouldnt come close to Seau."
Chargers,39o3xc,Wubble,2,Sat Jun 13 18:39:06 2015 UTC,"Not saying he wasn't a monster but so was Seau. Barely any teams even carry a FB anymore, they just aren't as useful.   Of course it's all hypothetical so it would be fun to watch Neal again in his prime, I'm not saying it's a wrong pick, I just don't think he would give more of an impact on the team than picking someone like Seau."
Chargers,39o3xc,ExodusWM,1 point,Sat Jun 13 19:38:31 2015 UTC,"I don't think that it's that the FB is obsolete in today's NFL. I think it's because there just aren't FB's like Neal/Alstott/etc any more. Guys don't want to play that position. Neal was the last of a dying breed, imo.   I could be wrong but that's just how it seems to me."

Chargers,39jra0,highastronaut,7,Thu Jun 18 21:02:58 2015 UTC,"It's a very good sign that he keeps talking about the difference between the nfl and college. It shows he has a lot of maturity and intelligence. Most young players wouldn't describe their playstyle as ""I don't know we will see. It's a different game than college."""
Chargers,39ljsk,PsychicWarElephant,11,Fri Jun 12 16:07:19 2015 UTC,I mean that's got to be about the dumbest comment a big time analyst has said.
Chargers,39ljsk,KJBNH,6,Fri Jun 12 16:12:32 2015 UTC,I'm very curious to know who he thinks the better backs of that time are.
Chargers,39ljsk,fuckdirectv,3,Fri Jun 12 17:01:00 2015 UTC,"AP? Emmit Smith? I have no idea.  I liked Clayton because of his ESPN commercial, now I will hate that ad."
Chargers,39ljsk,SLAP_ME_SIDEWAYS,4,Fri Jun 12 18:59:12 2015 UTC,"Emmitt Smith was pretty much done by then, so I don't think he counts.  Not to mention that the only reason he is ahead of LT in any major statistical categories is the fact that he played for 15 seasons.  You could make an argument for AP, but if you look at their all-around stats, as opposed to simply looking at rushing yards, I think LT is the hands-down winner as it stands now.  AP has more average rushing yards per season and a higher career YPC, but LT averaged more TDs, fewer fumbles and has significantly better numbers as a receiver.  Plus LT has 7 TD passes and a career passer rating of 146+.  AP has never thrown a pass."
Chargers,39ljsk,fuckdirectv,1 point,Fri Jun 12 23:32:29 2015 UTC,"But I think that he was the second- or third-best in that era -- back when Adrian Peterson was just coming in.   Boom, we got a time frame. AD's debut season was back in 2007 which was the year we finished 1st in the division and beat the Colts in the playoffs. So already, Clayton is looking like a fool. But let's look at this strictly from a rushing perspective. LT finished 1st in both total yards and touchdowns and had no fumbles. Now he had only 4.7 yards per rushing attempt which looks average compared to AD's yards per rush of 5.6, but this is a poor stat to judge with when players like Ronnie Brown and Jerious Norwood with far less attempts totally throw off the system. The only stats where LT looks kind of human are in the receiving category, as he finished 3rd in receptions and 2nd in total yards among running backs. Of course, this was because he was beat out by receiving backs Brian Westbrook and Reggie Bush. Think about this though, did either of those two throw for a touchdown that season? No they did not.  TL;DR, John Clayton is a dummy if he thinks Reggie Bush or Ronnie Brown are better running backs than LaDainian Tomlinson."
Chargers,39ljsk,MrSuperBacon,3,Sat Jun 13 21:42:59 2015 UTC,"Barry Sanders? Jim Brown? Emmit Smith? Sweetness? There's a few guys that could be ahead of LT. That said, in terms of the most ""complete"" back, he probably wins.  EDIT: Completely misread it. Yeah. Clayton, what you been smoking?"
Chargers,39ljsk,Yooklid,3,Fri Jun 12 16:47:36 2015 UTC,this is why I'm afraid to age. I don't want to think like this. Only 3 years ago he was saying LT is a 1st ballot HoFer with no doubt.
Chargers,39ljsk,MikeMcNorv,3,Fri Jun 12 17:43:14 2015 UTC,ESPN says things for clicks
Chargers,39ljsk,highastronaut,2,Sat Jun 13 06:09:45 2015 UTC,"Man, they are trying really hard to drum up NFL news"
Chargers,39ljsk,onebigwaffle,2,Fri Jun 12 16:34:47 2015 UTC,"I was listening to ESPN radio up here in Seattle on the drive home yesterday when I heard the Professor say this. He's normally very knowledgeable on all things NFL so I was very surprised he didn't consider LT the best back of his era.   I wouldn't pay much attention to this quote- This kind of thing happens on live radio; people say things without fully processing it in their minds first. I think this is one of those instances, especially since the particular segment the hosts just throw random questions at the guy and Clayton has to answer without very much time to process."
Chargers,39ljsk,pacificislandr4,2,Fri Jun 12 16:56:03 2015 UTC,"At first I thought the title said second or third best of all time and I thought it was a little high. But then I see it says of his era and Clayton is smoking something. If Clayton means that he is one of the top 3 RB in the last 20 years I would totally agree.  LT came in at the end of Faulk's career and then AP came in at the end of LT's. If you compare those three guys I think they all have a claim to being the best. Faulk was a good as both a runner and pass catcher, LT scored more TDs and had more rushing yards than Faulk, and AP is a great runner but not as great pass catcher. Obviously there is more to it than those simple statement, but suffice to say they are all three great players who have slightly different attributes.  If LT doesn't make it as a first ballot hall of famer there is something wrong with the voters. Unless they hold the lack of a Super Bowl against him, LT should be treated just like Faulk was and get in on the first vote."
Chargers,39ljsk,boltsteve,2,Fri Jun 12 21:49:46 2015 UTC,Fact: LT is the best RB of of the 2000s
Chargers,39ljsk,fucky0urkarma,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:24:40 2015 UTC,"A buddy texted me saying that Clayton said that LT getting into the HOF was iffy. I thought for sure he misheard and that Clayton was maybe talking about being a first ballot inductee, but this is just silly."
Chargers,39ljsk,Darth_Banal,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:46:40 2015 UTC,"I see some people put Faulk over LT in the all time discussions in /r/nfl/, and I wonder if it's people who never saw him play, maybe don't realize he's such a prolific scorer and that's one of the most important stats of an RB, or what...I just don't get it. And that's if ""second best back of that time"" were true. Third best? Who the fuck else would possibly be better ""of that time""?"
Chargers,39ljsk,SunriseSurprise,1 point,Sat Jun 13 00:32:31 2015 UTC,Clayton must have been high as hell when he wrote this. LT did stuff as a RB people are just now starting to encorperate as standard. He also did stuff nobody dares make standard...like throw passes...for TDs. That is the definition of the best of that era.  Union Trollbune at it again.
Chargers,39ljsk,BobTaco,2,Fri Jun 12 18:21:22 2015 UTC,"this was a quote that I heard on the radio, UT is reposting it saying its ridiculous.  I hate the UT, but this for once, isn't their doing."
Chargers,39ljsk,BobTaco,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:31:27 2015 UTC,I worded stuff wrong. But I knew the UT was just rehashing what the moron Clayton said. The issue I have with it is...like with the rest of the UT...it's click bait. The UT tradition still continues.

Chargers,39jaex,badbillsvc,4,Fri Jun 12 04:17:10 2015 UTC,"See the problem though is fabiani still has a job...which means that all the negative things hes saying are what the organization really feels, or they would have  fired him/made him change his tune."
Chargers,39jaex,Dudecalion,3,Fri Jun 12 05:24:54 2015 UTC,"I think it's more like, Fabiani has been in Spanos' ear all these years, Fabiani is in Goldman-Sachs' pocket, Goldman-Sachs wants to back a team in LA, Fabiani stands to make a lot of money if the team moves. I believe Spanos wanted to keep the team here but after years of this pressure to move he's finally relented."
Chargers,39jaex,zeehrob,4,Fri Jun 12 13:58:05 2015 UTC,"I don't believe that at all. Spanos knows what he wants, Fabiani is just the ""bad cop"" in all of this"
Chargers,39jaex,ace-destrier,3,Fri Jun 12 17:15:49 2015 UTC,"Though some view Fabiani as an impediment to achieving an approved stadium in San Diego, ultimately Fabiani is the messenger for Spanos.   No, Eric D. Williams. Do not reduce Fabiani to simply being a spokesman for Dean. Ultimately, Fabiani is the messenger and the strategist. He is counsel and executor. He is a smart and deviously clever man.   So, yeah, it'd be nice to keep Fabiani away from the stadium talks, but there's nothing to stop Dean from continuing to seek his counsel. At best, keep Fabiani away and he has to learn all the negotiation information secondhand, but how much of a disadvantage is that? It could simply be a hinderance. And I think if the petition was successful, time Fabiani isn't spending in stadium talks and on San Diego efforts, which is probably limited as is, would likely be focused on the Carson efforts.   We're losers either way. Everything's shitty as long as Fabiani's still a part of the picture. The only solution is to go back in time and put Jim Steeg in front of Dean when he was looking to hire someone to get a new stadium done. My time machine's shot. Anyone else?  ETA: Whether or not the petition has a chance and is successful or not, cheers to Byron Moore."
Chargers,39jaex,umadbrew,3,Fri Jun 12 05:32:02 2015 UTC,"Fabiani was hired in 2002 by Dean to help get a new stadium deal done. That's 13 years of failure, yet somehow this fucker still has a job."

Chargers,39hnqs,TheFakeTomTelesco,4,Fri Jun 12 00:07:10 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't want him.  Look at our OL, and the guys that Joe D has brought in to this team.  He absolutely wants a certain type of guy.  He's looking for big, physical maulers that are long and have some athleticism.  Mathis is great...in a zone blocking scheme, everything he does is based off of his ability to take correct angles and burst off the snap.  You rarely see him really move guys off the ball, I don't think he fits in here very well.  Sure guys like that can succeed in Joe D's scheme....see Andy Levitre...but the ideal OL seems to be a completely polar opposite type of player than Mathis.  Thats not even considering that he's a 34 year old guy who's going to be looking for at least a 2 or 3 year deal worth 4+ mil a year (his old contract was 5.5m and he was quite confident that he was worth that much for the Eagles, which is why they cut him)."

Chargers,39hnqs,Zack,8,Thu Jun 11 21:44:42 2015 UTC,I don't think we are going to sign him. RG is probably the least valuable position on the offense and signing an older vet who demands a higher salary doesn't seem like a philosophy TT is advocating

Chargers,39hnqs,BJEdwards,11,Thu Jun 11 23:27:38 2015 UTC,"Looks like we've got a little under $12m left. I thought we'd be out of the discussion but this makes me think otherwise. If we somehow get him, I see a deep playoff run in our immediate future.   I was in the Chargers locker room for the first round of the draft and spoke with Jacoby Jones for a little. He was telling me the story of how he came to sign with us, and said after meeting with the front office and before visiting the next team, Jacoby told his agent something along the lines of, ""Yo don't say anything yet, but I'm signing with these guys."" He said he knew the minute he left the meeting. I had a lot of faith in Telesco & co. having one hell of a sales pitch before hearing that from him, and that sealed my opinion. Fingers crossed!"

Chargers,39hnqs,simboisland,5,Thu Jun 11 23:35:31 2015 UTC,"The problem is it's a lot more realistic for a player to accept a one year prove it deal from a new team than his own. So with that, maybe we lose out on Weddle on a long term extension but we get Mathis one year on a prove it.  And now we've evolved into a win now mode, so I could see it happening and let the cards fall with Weddle after the season."

Chargers,39hnqs,BJEdwards,4,Fri Jun 12 00:41:06 2015 UTC,Could we afford him?
Chargers,39hnqs,aznoob,5,Fri Jun 12 00:41:13 2015 UTC,Depends on what he wants. The reason we didn't go after him was the contract he had and what the Eagles wanted for it.
Chargers,39hnqs,bdubbz14,3,Thu Jun 11 20:02:18 2015 UTC,"If I read this right, we have $17 million in cap space. Assuming the Top 51 is what really matters. We all know we have tons of cap space next year as well, and re-signing Rivers and Weddle will come with signing bonuses and small cap hits in that year. So I imagine yes, we can afford him.  EDIT: And according to this by the NFLPA, which says its generated daily, we have $11.6 million in cap space. Which is a bit more than double what Mathis was set to earn this year."
Chargers,39hnqs,BJEdwards,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:10:28 2015 UTC,we dont have 17 million in cap space. We have 3 million.

Chargers,39oe08,BoltB11,2,Sat Jun 13 10:57:30 2015 UTC,"On a more serious note, Andre Johnson is only 33 years old. Receivers in the NFL can be surprisingly resilient. For instance,  Steve Smith is 36 and had a pretty good season with the Ravens (1,065 yds, 13.5 avg). And that's after coming off a relative down year. Not saying I don't approve of the Stevie Johnson choice, I prefer it. But who knows what AJ could have done with Rivers throwing to him? I shudder to think what kind of numbers Luck can put up with both Hilton and AJ, lol."
Chargers,39oe08,NightClerk,2,Sat Jun 13 19:12:48 2015 UTC,Nah I got you man lol. I was rooting for us to get Andre but wasnt really upset we didn't get him because of his age. Im sure it wouldnt have been a big deal but it limits how much you can get out of him. Also Im happier with Stevie Johnson than I would have been with Adrian.

That said, Eagles have had kind of a funky offseason so he might have been not too keen on staying and hence asking for the raise again, so who knows.  We already got one OL who was looking for a raise and ended up taking way less in a prove-it deal, so let's see what happens. I'd love it even if we have a pretty good line now just so that we don't only have 5 good OL. We can count on at least one OL injury during the year, so having someone competent waiting in the wings for once would be a good plan."

Chargers,39g5n1,Busterifle,5,Thu Jun 11 14:30:52 2015 UTC,"If we get a new stadium then the price of their lease will surely go up, I seem to remember an estimate of about $750k/yr higher. If the Chargers move, the Aztecs will likely play out their lease (2019) and the stadium will be torn down. The city can't afford to upkeep a stadium that only has one tenant. Heck, they can't afford it now. Either way, State is screwed.    Rocky Long was just saying yesterday how being in a pro town benefits recruiting, amongst other things. The Chargers staying would probably be the better case scenario for their program, as opposed to building and maintaining their own stadium.    You have to think though, if the Chargers move, would people here be more likely to attend Aztec games?"
Chargers,39g5n1,Dudecalion,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:38:14 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, absolutely the Aztecs games would be packed. Cities with only one (decent/pro) source of a sport get behind them so much. San Antonio is in love with UTSA's football, and they've only just recently turned watchable."

Chargers,39e36u,djs7372,11,Thu Jun 11 03:14:37 2015 UTC,Would like to add that this funding would be for the current cities. This makes sense for the Rams from a business standpoint since they could be the only team in LA and have no competition for the market.

This is a weird time between our cities and our fan bases. What ends up good for one of our cities may only be possible because of the detriment of the other's. Still, we do have empathy for you guys for going through what we're going through. The NFL has really screwed over the both of our cities, and I really do wish you guys the very best.   So believe me when I say that Kroenke is human garbage and should not ever be trusted to do the right thing. He seriously makes Dean Spanos and Mark Fabiani look like Pope Francis and Mr. Rogers. Whatever he offers will come at your detriment."

Chargers,39ikq0,averagejoe1993,2,Thu Jun 11 23:51:02 2015 UTC,"I was involved in a deal to move the Raiders to Inglewood before Kroenke bought that property.  The deal was that Davis would sell 20% of the team for $200M, then move to LA and the buyer could buy the rest of the team for $1.6B giving them a 10% ""discount"" on the valuation (of $2B).  Basically, the Raiders are worth at least 2x more IN LA, so Davis wants to capture most of those dollars according to his investment thesis.  I really don't see Kroenke ""helping"" the Chargers, as the cost-benefit of that kind of help is not very clear to me.  I do see the Rams/Raiders pairing in Inglewood happening because Davis needs to move in order to cash out.  Davis will do anything to get to LA, so his offer to Kroenke is likely to be better than Spanos.  The NFL could (should) apportion a larger share of those relocation fees to the Chargers as compensation for losing some LA market share.  I do think that this is the most likely scenario."
Chargers,39ikq0,froggy184,1 point,Thu Jun 11 23:57:43 2015 UTC,"On some level, the Chargers have to be thinking along these lines.  I think that much of the hard ball they are playing has to do with this scenario playing out, and then fearing that the City of SD might pull the rug out again and spike the stadium deal.  So they are playing on our fears to get some kind of deal locked in whether it's here or LA."

Chargers,397qfi,mannym3,8,Tue Jun 9 23:26:30 2015 UTC,He turned up two years ago.

Chargers,397bwc,timbobarry,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:39:22 2015 UTC,City wide only.  County wide votes are not eligible for a mail in ballot election.  I don't think this vote is going to happen though.  This is a stand by the city and mayor to show the NFL that they can make it happen however.  I think the whole LA deal gets pushed back another year and gives Oakland and San Diego more time to flush out a deal.

Liuget is legit - I hope we can get some better supporting players around him and he'll be even more dominant than he is now. Considering most teams were assigning the 10 year old water boy to block Reyes so the rest of the line could concentrate on Liuget, if Reyes can get replaced with somebody worth a damn, Corey could start wreaking havoc for QBs as he has the skill to do so when not double/triple teamed constantly."

Chargers,393i7x,BJEdwards,4,Tue Jun 9 00:20:06 2015 UTC,http://www.spotrac.com/nfl/rankings/average/defensive-end/  Seems like this would put him around 10th highest DE?
Chargers,393i7x,tyrannoflorist,2,Tue Jun 9 00:26:09 2015 UTC,"Just out of curiosity, does anyone know if that is above average or???   Check this list. Liuget's extension puts him at $10 million per year average, which would put him as #10 on the list of highest paid DEs for this year. Next year he moves up to #8, but that is because of a couple of 1 year deals ending."
Chargers,393i7x,bdubbz14,8,Tue Jun 9 00:42:28 2015 UTC,"Comparing a 3-4 defensive end contract to a 4-3 defensive end contract is bonkers. It's apples and oranges. For a better comparison (but still with faults), you'd be better off comparing a 3-4 3 tech DE to a 4-3 3 tech DT, and a 4-3 DE to a 3-4 OLB.  Given that, Liuget would be the 3rd highest paid 3-4 DE, after JJ Watt and Calais Campbell, right above Jurrell Casey."
Chargers,393i7x,basedcharger,3,Tue Jun 9 02:27:08 2015 UTC,Anybody extremely entertained by the idea of signing Muhammad Wilkerson next year with the astronomical cap space we'll have?   Just imagine these two on the same line as Ryan Carrethers looks around nervously
Chargers,393i7x,bdubbz14,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:54:48 2015 UTC,I was pondering this thought as well but Wilkerson would ask for a hefty sum probably more than Liugets contract.

Rivers, although older, is key to our Bolts' success.    i'd love to have The Beard for another few years, he's so solid on and off the field.  but the money he's asking for after he turns 31 is too much.  love Eric, but c'mon - the NFL is a business and Weddle only had one pick last year; ball-hawk he is not.  he can tackle the best of our secondary (Verrett might give him a run on this one if he could stay healthy).  *edit - Weddle didn't help himself by playing so much.  he killed his body to play 98% of D-snaps, and 49% of ST - now the team is using that against him - very sad to sacrifice yourself like that and not be rewarded.  lame.  but it's a multi-billion dollar biz, these guys get used, beat-up, then tossed aside.  bummer, because The Beard is one top-notch man and football player  i hate the biz side of football.  love our team, waiting for a SB victory!"

Chargers,392slh,chargerland,2,Tue Jun 9 00:24:32 2015 UTC,but you missed my point - no other D player has ever started 98% on D and 49% on all ST plays.  at least that's what i read in the UT a few weeks back.  must find link - but remember stats weren't always a thing  He gets paid to be a safety - not half of ST plays (in response to your comment)
Chargers,392slh,og_sandiego,6,Tue Jun 9 01:24:20 2015 UTC,"I agree Corey> Weddle. But Weddle's body is not ""killed"". He takes good care of himself. Look at Charles Woodson, he is 38 and just had arguably his best season."
Chargers,392slh,miketheblade,2,Mon Jun 8 21:59:08 2015 UTC,i hope so.  but did Mr. Woodson play almost 50% of ST snaps?  they're using that against Weddle now :(

Really great thumpers at ILB are still an extremely hot commodity in today's NFL, and Perryman fits the bill out of the gate as a run stopper who has the potential to develop into having at least adequate coverage skills. He's more athletic than Te'o and Te'o's coverage skills really shined last season (though obviously Te'o is a guy known to have great instincts, which are essential to be good in coverage as a linebacker, so it might not be a fair comparison)."

Chargers,39455e,MuaddibMcFly,6,Tue Jun 9 05:59:48 2015 UTC,The more I see him in interviews and after his AMA I think we would have liked him if he had stayed with us. I also think that maybe he's not the biggest bad guy in that whole scenario.  It's his fucking dad we should all dislike.   Edit: or maybe Leaf as the post below me suggests. That is starting to make a ridiculous amount of sense.
Chargers,392yfg,WELLINGTONjr,2,Mon Jun 8 21:44:06 2015 UTC,I've seen that guy in the #1 jersey at games for years now. He's always leading that banner into the stadium from the East to the West end zone (I think he sits there?). Always cheering hard as hell! That's a true Bolt fan right there.
Chargers,392yfg,bubbavic,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:00:02 2015 UTC,That is Alvarez. He is the founder of #BoltPride and very active in San Diego as a fan and activist. You should come to a home or away game with #BoltPride

Chargers,392zw3,basedcharger,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:34:04 2015 UTC,I don't necessarily disagree with you. But I'm curious why you say that.
Chargers,392zw3,basedcharger,2,Tue Jun 9 02:20:17 2015 UTC,I'm not very high on Reyes at all to be frank. Apart from the Bills game he hasnt flashed anything really great or impressive. Maybe its the scheme or him being out of position? (I've read that people think he would be better as a 4-3 DT). Overall I think it might be time to move on from Reyes as our DE opposite Liuget. I already kind of see us drafting a DE with out first or second pick in the draft next year to replace him.
Chargers,392zw3,miketheblade,1 point,Tue Jun 9 02:30:34 2015 UTC,Maybe we do. I could see us shifting the strength of our defense from the back to the front.   Once Weddle leaves TT will get to decide where to reallocate the money from Weddle's contact. Maybe it goes into the front seven.

Chargers,393ftn,GamsGotMoxie,6,Mon Jun 8 23:54:06 2015 UTC,We rarely run base 3-4 and run four man fronts the majority of the time.
Chargers,393ftn,AnExtraordinaire,4,Tue Jun 9 02:05:16 2015 UTC,It's a 3-4 and 4-3 hybrid...but is more towards the 4-3 side. Why people keep saying Chargers run a 3-4 (because one snap out of four is 3-4) is beyond me.
Chargers,393ftn,BobTaco,0,Tue Jun 9 06:08:05 2015 UTC,Chargers run a 3-4 (because one snap out of four is 3-4) is beyond me.   Because that's 1/4 more than most teams?

Chargers,391tbs,innuen-doh,14,Mon Jun 8 17:08:13 2015 UTC,"I actually don't really think they will be able to keep it full. Especially without some serious post season success to scoop up bandwagoners, I just don't see how because LA is full of either transplants who still like their hometown team or natives who root for the Raiders or the Rams. Now, keep in mind that there is like 19 or 20 MILLION people in LA metro area, roughly the population of Florida, and if they actually can win a SB while PR is still our QB and break through this 9-7 garbage the sheeple will come, but this is not like an NFL team going to some market that is excited for any team to root for. LA has many choices when it comes to sports teams and they are not going to show up for a Charger team that can't even make it to a Super Bowl let alone win one."
Chargers,391tbs,latebraker,2,Mon Jun 8 17:25:46 2015 UTC,"As a season ticket holder for 5 years I'd probably make the trip from Carlsbad for a season and feel it out. With that said I think they would not have a problem filling seats. I don't think they would be at capacity but probably pretty close to what the Q fills now. The Clippers still sold out with the Lake show in town, even before they were good. Bottom line is people wanna go to a game, regardless of who's playing. With all that said I hope they stay in San Diego, screw LA."
Chargers,391tbs,Rustball,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:24:58 2015 UTC,We would be in different divisions if that happened? not sure. I think Chargers would be fine. This is really an owners question about $
Chargers,391tbs,miketheblade,6,Mon Jun 8 18:51:00 2015 UTC,"Honest answer: Every time I go to a Charger game, a large portion of the fans are there to see the other team. San Diego is an area where a lot of people are transplants. I assume the same is true of LA. It's kind if disheartening, but I get the demographic reasons why this is.   That said, in the long run, people spend money to come out for teams that win. If the Chargers win, no matter where they are, the fans will come out. Same with the Raiders. Personally, I'd make the trek out to a new stadium at least once, and base whether or not to do so again on the quality of the experience. Qualcomm sucks, and as of now my experience is way better watching from home."
Chargers,391tbs,sp0rkah0lic,8,Mon Jun 8 17:27:48 2015 UTC,It's a bluff.  It's going to be the Rams and you guys sharing a stadium.
Chargers,391tbs,TheFakeTomTelesco,3,Mon Jun 8 19:23:19 2015 UTC,"It's an interesting thought. Especially with the whole ""Rivers won't stay if the team moves to LA"" shenanigans. I could see a scenario where they move, Rivers retires, Raiders have a decent up and coming team, and they win the hearts of LA while the Chargers suck. Chargers become Clippers 2.0 (minus the past few years of Clippers being great)."
Chargers,391tbs,anteros86,2,Mon Jun 8 17:19:49 2015 UTC,"I think the Spanoses have a ""the grass is greener"" attitude about LA and are in for a rude awakening if they ever get to LA. I fully expect them to be the 2nd or 3rd team in LA, and when they see the grass is not greener, demand (not ask) that the city of San Diego takes them back (because far be it for them to actually admit they made a mistake in leaving)."
Chargers,391tbs,Orgasmo3000,6,Mon Jun 8 18:21:12 2015 UTC,"The stadium could probably sell out, but it would likely be like every game we played was an away game. I live in Portland and love traveling down to SD for games (hell, I even love you guys' fancy little Bay), but I really can't stand LA. I've been a Chargers fan since the Superbowl year (I was 5), but it would feel wrong rooting for an LA team."
Chargers,391tbs,Sprinklesss,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:00:31 2015 UTC,How do you  travel? Bus? Train? Car? Plane?
Chargers,391tbs,MuaddibMcFly,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:21:41 2015 UTC,"Usually plane. I've taken a bus before, but never past the Bay Area."
Chargers,391tbs,Sprinklesss,2,Tue Jun 9 19:28:05 2015 UTC,"I would expect that the NFL is going to or already has commissioned some kind of market study of the 3 teams and their support levels in the LA market.  In the most effective versions of these types of studies, they ask respondents to rank the teams, and otherwise configure them (which two would you prefer the most?), etc.  I'm pretty sure the Chargers would come up on the short end of that stick.  I know that Mark Davis is looking to sell the team once he gets it to LA by hook or by crook, so he is highly incentivized to make a deal with whoever is the #1 team to the area.  I also do not buy the Charger's contention that they can't survive economically with another team in LA were they to remain in SD.  This was literally proven false in the past when the Raiders were in LA, the Rams in OC, and the Chargers sharing the Murph with the Padres.  The NFL is much larger, more popular and more lucrative now than it was then, and they seem to have been just fine.   It seems absurd that the NFL would choose the Chargers over the Raiders to LA for those market study reasons and because the Raiders really have zero momentum getting Oakland to play ball with them.  The NFL (if it acts rationally) should allow the Rams to move, the Raiders to join them, and support some version of the CSAG proposal."
Chargers,391tbs,froggy184,5,Tue Jun 9 00:36:02 2015 UTC,"I have family all over LA and Orange Counties and no one knows a Charger fan. I would still go if the stadium was in South Orange County, but I'm not going all the way up to Carson or Hollywood."

Chargers,391tbs,dannymac1784,2,Mon Jun 8 22:20:33 2015 UTC,i said we are there.  according to the Chargers - 25% of our fans come from LA area.  i know a huge developer here in SD and he says the Bolts moving is a 'done deal' - pretty pissed when he said it.    but i know that we have many fans in OC/LA/SB - sorry for the misunderstanding.

Chargers,391tbs,dannymac1784,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:27:31 2015 UTC,"so let me ask you - if they move to Carson, would you be happy or happier than The Murph they currently play in?"
Chargers,391tbs,og_sandiego,3,Mon Jun 8 22:30:05 2015 UTC,"honestly if they moved to another state i would still travel to see them. ive loved them since the early 90's. Im just happy to watch my favorite team play, they could play at the bottom of the ocean and id try to get tickets. I love SD and try to go whenever i can but im 30 miles outside of LA anyway and 4 freeways from Carson so it wouldnt bother me too much. I just love me some Felipe."
Chargers,391tbs,dannymac1784,2,Mon Jun 8 22:32:15 2015 UTC,damn.  good on you.  i love 'em bc it says San Diego and that's where I and my kids were born.    if they moved to LA?  i would be heartbroken rooting for an LA team vs. my beloved SD
Chargers,391tbs,og_sandiego,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:37:03 2015 UTC,"ive been a Clippers fan for as long as I can remember. I dont share the hatred of the SD vs LA thing like most do.

I love SD as much as I love LA and I never lived in SD but I have never had a bad experience there."
Chargers,391tbs,dannymac1784,2,Mon Jun 8 22:41:35 2015 UTC,"The question really is, will there be enough corporate/celebrity types in LA willing to shell out the big bucks to take up the luxury seats?  And that answer is likely a resounding yes."

Chargers,391tbs,og_sandiego,2,Mon Jun 8 22:06:09 2015 UTC,"There's no doubt it's a terrible idea.  When the Chargers and Raiders play, I would see it essentially being another home game for the Raiders.  Personally I think the Chargers' best chance for success in LA would be if they completely rebranded themselves with a new name and a new image.  I would not continue to support the Chargers if they move from SD to LA.  I'm sure many people still would, but I have a hard time seeing a lot of SD fans wanting to drive up the 405 and deal with the traffic and all the other stuff to attend those games."

Chargers,391tbs,WillowYouIdiot,2,Mon Jun 8 18:07:42 2015 UTC,They can barely fill up the Q what is the worst that could happen?
Chargers,391tbs,pick6and1,2,Mon Jun 8 22:25:24 2015 UTC,"Just my personal opinion of course, but unless the Chargers are the very first team in the market and get the full market for two to three years (which isn't going to happen, the Rams are coming), I don't believe the team can establish itself quickly enough to compete with the Raiders or Rams. And they'll have a dual problem because I think far too many current fans will completely sour and not support them. So they'll be screwed from both sides, in other words.  Winning will always change that because people hop on a winning bandwagon like flies on shit. If they suddenly become world beaters in LA, I'll be miserable about that. Sick to my stomach for a lifetime. Something, something, San Diego Curse.  I think their best shot is a rebrand of the entire team. Go with something fresh so old rivalries and biases are dead and it's easier for new fans to support a team that feels strictly Los Angeles.   Which is fine with me, leave the Chargers brand, even if they're nothing but a permanent memory, in San Diego where it belongs. I'll support the dead team and hope they bring us back someday rather than support the new LA team."
Chargers,391tbs,HeavensentLXXI,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:46:04 2015 UTC,The games will probably sell out the first 2-3 seasons but not because people are charger fans but to see the new stadium. I think once the new stadium hype dies down then there will be a long term problem with filling seats.
Chargers,391tbs,Radwizardps4,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:35:24 2015 UTC,I know plenty of Chargers fans in Riverside County and San Bernardino that will fill those seats. It will take some time for the SD fans to get over the loss of the team but I bet they will come around.

Chargers,38t4zl,BobTaco,3,Sat Jun 6 17:30:37 2015 UTC,Same way they talked about the LA move. Written in stone. :-\
Chargers,38p2a0,scubaaron,9,Fri Jun 5 17:41:19 2015 UTC,"...Philon committed to stay in his home state and play for the Crimson Tide. But things didn't work out as planned. Rather than sit out as a grayshirt at Alabama, Philon chose to attend Arkansas.  Philon entered the draft early after his redshirt sophomore season at Arkansas. He was projected to go as high as the third round, but fell to the sixth round.   Seems like he could have used another year in college, that's why he went in the 6th. Good speed, just underdeveloped."
Chargers,38p2a0,LukeNeverShaves,8,Fri Jun 5 19:13:59 2015 UTC,His size and strength are his biggest weakness. His body is still developing so at times he was overmatched by a big guy in one on one or double teamed. His speed and quick explosions helped him though.   I'll be writing a little post with some clips showing his better plays for some of the games this past year. Basically when he was one on one and got a quick move against the guy he was phenomenal at getting in the backfield. He is also extremely quick at stunts. He was lucky and was paired with DE Trey Flowers (drafted by New England) and LB Martrell Spaight (drafted by Washington) so all 3 worked to create chaos for an o line. From everything I've read it looks like well use him as a DE more than a DT. He has bull rush ability to drive a one on one blocker back and speed to beat him around the corner so I think hell do very well. Won't expect a major year as he still needs development but next year I expect him to blow up plays left and right.

Chargers,38p2a0,Duffman5755,9,Fri Jun 5 19:09:07 2015 UTC,Yup...Troutman was supposed to be the shit...so raw...so much potential. Potential doesn't mean anything unless you actually reach it.
Chargers,38p2a0,LukeNeverShaves,5,Fri Jun 5 19:10:45 2015 UTC,"Huh???? Troutman was the exact opposite of that.  He wasn't very athletic, but he was pretty sound technique/awareness wise (didn't give up a sack his Sr. Year at Penn).  The question was if he was athletic enough to be more than a backup in the NFL (The guy ran damn near a 5.7 second 40 and had a ton of numbers equally as bad).  He showed some mental lapses when trying to play with the better athletes, and just didn't play well all together because of it..."
Chargers,38p2a0,latebraker,4,Sat Jun 6 03:09:14 2015 UTC,Still gotta write up my piece but I don't expect Philon to disappoint haha. He's got speed and moves and it looks like well use him more as a DE than DT and I think hell excel in one on one against a lineman when he grows a bit more and puts on some more muscle.
Chargers,38p2a0,LukeNeverShaves,2,Fri Jun 5 19:57:53 2015 UTC,So he is going to challenge Reyes?
Chargers,38p2a0,crustycupcakes,2,Fri Jun 5 22:27:55 2015 UTC,Could be both. He can challenge and compliment a defender which I think is a special thing to have. I see him in a lot of spots along the line to figure out where hell fit with our system and who hell challenge and compliment. He's a phenomenal run defender and an adequate pass rusher when he wasn't double teamed. Hard to tell how well use him.

Chargers,38lhio,SupremeSouthpaw,6,Fri Jun 5 06:09:21 2015 UTC,"I helped Phillip Rivers at the Apple Store in UTC, I worked at once. That was awesome, he came in with like 5 daughters it was crazy, they broke the ipod screen, Rivers was kinda pissed he had to pay for it. I was starstruck though, it was awesome!"
Chargers,38lhio,Flesh_Lettuce,5,Fri Jun 5 21:37:44 2015 UTC,I met Melvin Gordon before he got drafted. Very nice guy.
Chargers,38lhio,surgerylad,5,Fri Jun 5 18:41:01 2015 UTC,Larry English was the nicest guy.
Chargers,38lhio,miketheblade,4,Fri Jun 5 06:14:09 2015 UTC,"I met Larry English at an autograph event in Fashion Valley a few years back. He was pretty nice, but he seemed bummed because he was coming off an injury, and nobody really knew who he was so he was kinda sitting there awkwardly whilst everyone but my now-ex girlfriend and I walked right by. Kinda funny really."
Chargers,38lhio,patkonglion,3,Fri Jun 5 06:53:31 2015 UTC,"Sad most fans hated him, dude got treated so unfair here."
Chargers,38lhio,FootClanSoldier,6,Fri Jun 5 11:27:51 2015 UTC,This happened a while ago.  I went to an elementary school where several of the players sent their kids as well.  Before an even I needed my tie tied and my mom told me to go ask Stan Humphries to help me.  So I went and asked him and he said he couldn't do it but his wife could help me
Chargers,38lhio,heyimrick,5,Fri Jun 5 16:34:14 2015 UTC,"Met Ryan Mathews at the Mission AMC when he was a rookie. He was dating a girl I used to work with at the time. Was a cool dude, shook hands and kept it really low key. I could tell he didn't want a ton of attention drawn to him.  One of my favorite ex-Chargers I met was Antonio Garay. Dude was so nice. Met him at Vons off of Aero (close to the facility). Cool dude and it was funny seeing him drive off in his Hello Kitty car."
Chargers,38lhio,ASVP23,4,Fri Jun 5 17:04:16 2015 UTC,"I met Steve Foley while I was working for TSA.. Incredibly nice guy. He came through with his leg still in a cast. I had to screen him and his bags. I knew he looked familiar immediately. Before I could really ask, two female coworkers came over and asked ""How did you hurt your leg?"" Without missing a beat he says ""I broke it playing kickball..."" They reacted with a ""WOW! Kickball? That's crazy!"" When they walked away I said ""... Dude.. Kickball?"" and Foley goes ""Yeeeah that was good huh!"" we cracked up. I asked him if he played ball, and he got a solemn look on his face and said ""Yeah I used to..."" I told him I used to love watching him play, told him about a jersey I saw at DnB's that had his number and the name said ""Bulletproof"". He loved that and said he had seen the same. We talked a bit and he went on his way.  Foley was a really cool guy. He used to come through my terminal a lot and would always ask my supervisors if I was working. If I happened to be working, I'd hear ""YO RICK!"" and I'd go ""STEEEEVE!"" and we would chat it up a bit. Super friendly guy."
Chargers,38lhio,Sbstance,11,Fri Jun 5 17:18:32 2015 UTC,"I've seen: Philip Rivers, Darrell Stuckey, Eric Weddle, Danny Woodhead, Manti Te'o and DJ Fluker.

Chargers,38lhio,ace-destrier,9,Sat Jun 6 12:10:39 2015 UTC,he's pretty dry on the football field too.
Chargers,38lhio,trillinair,3,Fri Jun 5 02:40:55 2015 UTC,"No doubt, but in anything related to football involving fans, he makes an effort to be less dry."
Chargers,38lhio,trillinair,2,Fri Jun 5 02:45:50 2015 UTC,"I appreciate it! It's all good. I wanted a picture so bad but I didn't want to annoy him. Ironically, he was boarding a flight to Vegas with his wife and Fred Graves (WR Coach)."

Chargers,38lhio,InfrnalSky,3,Fri Jun 5 20:04:06 2015 UTC,I went to FCA and school with Ryan Miller. He was a big o-lineman who was on the team last year for like a week until he slipped and broke his neck or something like that. Felt bad for him not getting a real chance to shine.
Chargers,38lhio,AlekRivard,3,Sun Jun 7 09:56:53 2015 UTC,Met #55 at the grand opening of Stingaree. Awesome guy.
Chargers,38lhio,InfrnalSky,3,Fri Jun 5 03:35:10 2015 UTC,"Not a charger, but I played against Akili Smith at the ocean beach flag football league. I wanna say in like '08 or '09 so he was out of the league. He was impossible to sack and was a dick about it in a playful way I guess. Seemed nice enough during the handshake line at the end.  Met Hardwick and a couple backup o-line guys Dombrowski and Tyrone Green at the Adrian Gonzalez sports center in Eastlake in like 2010. All were nice and gave some workout tips to me and my buddies and took a few photos. Really serious about their workout routines though."
Chargers,38lhio,HeadleysHobos,4,Fri Jun 5 14:07:05 2015 UTC,"This most likely doesn't count, but during the Chargers practices when the fans got to attend, I was always impressed with Ryan Mathews. After practice was over and the players were signing autographs, he was always the last player to leave. He didn't speak very much, but he would only finish signing when everybody had left. I always thought it was generous of him to do.   Edit: Matthew Ryans..."

Chargers,38lhio,Danivan_,2,Fri Jun 5 21:36:19 2015 UTC,I met Marcus McNeill when he was still with the team. It was after the Bolt to the Q 5k. He just finished and looked super tired but was still really cool and took a picture with me. My dad also frequents the same gym that Hank Bauer goes to. Bauer is always really awesome and chats him up.
Chargers,38lhio,jbraun04,2,Fri Jun 5 22:41:45 2015 UTC,"Eric Parker was my neighbor for about a year. Fantastically nice guy. First thing he did once he moved in and settled down in the neighborhood was to have a BBQ and beers for whoever wanted to swing by.   Incredibly well grounded. Even though he was in the league for a couple more years, he was already planning his life and career post-football because, as he said, ""In this game you never know when your last play will be your final play."" Which was all too true, as he got injured at one point and never returned to the field."
Chargers,38lhio,jjumpman3,2,Fri Jun 5 04:46:24 2015 UTC,"I met Kris Dielman during the OMBAC tournament back in 2007 or 2008. (Shit, that long ago...?) I saw this big giant beautiful motherfucker and was awed by his size before I realized who he was. I asked him for a picture and he said, ""As long as you're not a Raiders fan."" I told him, ""Hell naw, my mom raised me right."" or something like that and we took a pic. He asked me what my team name was (for those who don't know-- really crass team names during the OMBAC OTL tournament are a thing) and he laughed and wished me luck. Really cool guy."
Chargers,38lhio,forte3,2,Fri Jun 5 15:59:45 2015 UTC,"I met Jamal Williams back in like 2007 or 2008 outside of PB Bar and Grill.  I'm 6'5 and was like, 270 at the time, and I felt tiny next to him.  His hands were absolutely gigantic.  We didn't want to bother him but he seemed super nice and high fived/shook hands with everyone."
Chargers,38lhio,CzarCruise,2,Fri Jun 5 16:26:45 2015 UTC,Met Keenan the day before the Chargers/Patriots game this year at Barona. He was a little hesitant about taking a picture but I wouldn't blame him
Chargers,38lhio,JCDC5,2,Fri Jun 5 16:33:05 2015 UTC,Met Weddle playing in the Mormon LDS basketball league.  Nice all around dude.
Chargers,38lhio,Sbstance,2,Fri Jun 5 19:10:18 2015 UTC,"Met Lo Neal here in Fresno one offseason at Doghouse. Was out for lunch with family and were discussing charger related stuff when my brother looks over and says ""I think that's Lo Neal!"" I turned around and it was, sitting in the middle of the restaurant. Went over to him and he gladly signed autographs and joked around with us for a few minutes. He was there with a few friends I'm guessing. Super nice guy."
Chargers,38lhio,lamada16,2,Fri Jun 5 20:58:15 2015 UTC,"Plug for the foundation I work for: www.proplayerfoundation.org  I have worked with multiple Chargers(and other NFL) Players officially since 2006 but I was a volunteer long before that.  List of players that I have worked with in the past or have met at events: Junior Seau, Drew Brees, Darren Bennett, Jacques Cesaire, Quentin Jammer, Antonio Garay, Nate Kaeding, Mike Scifres, Dave Binn, Antonio Cromartie, Doug Flutie, Shawn Merriman, Lorenzo Neal, Vincent Brown, Jerry Attaochu, Kendall Reyes, Darren Sproles, Mike Goff, Ryan Mathews, Branden Oliver, Antoine Cason, Larry English, Stephen Cooper, Shaun Philips, Nick Novak, Cam Thomas, John Carney etc etc.  Honestly I've never really had a seriously negative experience with any of them.  Cromartie and Merriman both had their own issues. Cromartie was very shy and Merriman was the exact opposite, wanting it to be like he was a rock star.  Jerry Attaochu was great at our last bowling event and really seemed to be having a good time. He was also really great with the kids we had come from Rady Children's.  Junior Seau and Darren Bennett are my all time favorites that I have worked with."
Chargers,38lhio,latebraker,2,Fri Jun 5 23:31:44 2015 UTC,Worked at the Jack in the Box off Scripps Poway and met LT while working the drive thru. Super friendly and down to earth dude. He even signed a Jack antenna ball for us.
Chargers,38lhio,chief-yeezy,2,Sat Jun 6 00:08:22 2015 UTC,Took a pic with legadu naanee. His mob was trying to ask for money for a pic. Don't know if it was serious or not. Made me feel uncomfortable but he was cool.

Chargers,38ji8o,OrionRivers,9,Thu Jun 4 17:11:37 2015 UTC,Since 1965.  Ours was 1963 iirc
Chargers,38ji8o,historymajor44,7,Thu Jun 4 17:25:48 2015 UTC,"But they credited Cleveland for winning a title 147 years ago, Buffalo's 1965 AFL title and not ours from 52 years ago. That's not a wording interpretation. They either mixed something up or just flat-out ignored 1963.  EDIT: Okay. I misread the article info. It was early in the morning. Pls have sympathy for a fellow sufferer."
Chargers,38ji8o,milkchococurry,10,Thu Jun 4 18:08:32 2015 UTC,"The Cleveland title wasn't 147 years ago, it was 147 combined seasons ago."
Chargers,38ji8o,IamMrT,2,Thu Jun 4 22:16:33 2015 UTC,"I don't think they're only factoring in NFL/AFL seasons, they're combining it with NBA, NHL/WHL, and MLB seasons as well (the Cleveland Indians didn't even exist 147 years ago), but the ""interpretation"" is indeed strange. The last time a Cleveland sports team won a championship were the Browns in 1964 (the Championship game took place in December of that year and didn't bleed over into January of 1965), which is, of course, a year off. Curiously enough, it's also the year after the Chargers won the AFL Championship  Buffalo's 1965 AFL win does count for the article since it does fall within in that range, so I think it's just a mix-up"
Chargers,38ji8o,MarcoCheng,1 point,Thu Jun 4 19:03:38 2015 UTC,"It makes you wonder why they chose that particular cutoff date and only recognize 1/2 the AFL titles. Then again, they didn't go to 1920 either to get all NFL titles.  Either way, everyone know that a person is off their rocker if they go back in time and don't go to November 12, 1955."
Chargers,38ji8o,TopHat1935,3,Fri Jun 5 03:41:33 2015 UTC,"Even with their own weird ranking system they ranked this incorrectly. SD should be on top...maybe 2nd, but certainly not 5th."
Chargers,38ji8o,BobTaco,2,Thu Jun 4 20:45:07 2015 UTC,No way. San Diego hasn't had the miserable history as Cleveland has. Any unbiased and diehard sports fan should know Cleveland is a shoe in for the title.
Chargers,38ji8o,Musingmike,3,Thu Jun 4 23:35:13 2015 UTC,Well SD def shouldn't be 5th...that's moronic.
Chargers,38ji8o,BobTaco,5,Fri Jun 5 00:39:09 2015 UTC,"Seriously. And after ATL? At least Atlanta has the braves who have a championship in semi-recent memory.   On top it should be Cleveland, Buffalo and SD in whatever order."
Chargers,38ji8o,crippnipp,3,Fri Jun 5 00:51:55 2015 UTC,That sounds better than where SD is actually listed. Hell you type in San Diego in Google...and sports curse actually shows up. Lol
Chargers,38ji8o,BobTaco,1 point,Fri Jun 5 00:54:25 2015 UTC,"I don't know I think we could give them a run for their money.  We've lost two basketball teams, a hockey team, and have threats of losing our football team. We've had some of ygr worst playoff luck in all of history (running into the '98 Yankees arguably one of the best teams of all time, ice bow, McCree-gate etc.)  They lost a football team for sure, but have they lost anyone else? In terms of relocation heartbreak we by far have the edge their since we lost three teams to their one.  Then if its just for straight up shittiness, the chargers and padres have a combined 5 championship appearances (including the 1963 AFL Title). And our teams aren't exactly barnstormers so to speak.  So I don't know, I'd think San Diego would at least come in a close second for most miserable sports cities."
Chargers,38ji8o,T-nawtical,4,Sat Jun 6 06:33:23 2015 UTC,Also they mention the Diamondbacks World Series win for PHX but claim their last championship was over 55 years ago? Makes no sense
Chargers,38ji8o,SantiagoAndDunbar,-1,Thu Jun 4 21:16:18 2015 UTC,No...just no. 55 seasons doesn't mean 55 years. You calculate ALL the sports franchises seasons and add them together. I'm surprised 2 people upvoted you. I had to downvote you because your post is so....wrong.

Chargers,38hscf,BurritoCon,3,Thu Jun 4 16:20:47 2015 UTC,Like I freaking said all along. There never was a Carson plan and it was leverage. I was right since day 1. The Chargers have NOTHING. They have no backup plan to leave for LA just like the Raiders. The Rams are the only team with any realistic plan to go to LA.
Chargers,38hscf,Musingmike,2,Thu Jun 4 23:30:55 2015 UTC,"Mayor of Carson said ""If I need to talk to the commissioner, I pick up the phone and call him"", but literally 0 emails?  Carson, at this point, is a leverage play to either get something in SD or get some kind of minority partnership with Kroenke in Inglewood, rather than being his tenant."

Those documents may very well show what the Chargers agreed to put up in equity for this deal, and having that info public would diminish the Charger's negotiating position be that in meetings with CSAG or in the media.  I think that the Inglewood site is selected and the Raiders (who are desperate to sell the team) will quickly make a deal to be tenants of Kronke's.  That would leave the Chargers with no choice but to deal with San Diego straight up or attempt to move to St. Louis or something."

Chargers,38j5c5,BobTaco,15,Thu Jun 4 22:12:35 2015 UTC,"Personally even though it hurts to say this, it's a good idea. If the Chargers want to play hardball, so should SD. People say SD isn't serious about testing to keep the Chargers. One way to try and prove they are serious is to look for another team to use the Stadium that IS going to be built even if the Chargers don't give a crap. Raiders actually have a market in SD/OC/LA. Plus Raiders offered $500 million to try and build a new stadium in Oakland. SD is asking for $300 million and we all know the Chargers think that's too much. It would be a discount to the Raiders.  If the Chargers can partner with the Raiders, so can SD. It's more about keeping the NFL in SD and not the Chargers, because every city that has lost the NFL regrets that situation later...  It's a terrible position to be in...but it's not a moronic idea if the Chargers are gonna be dicks about everything."
Chargers,38j5c5,baconbomb138,3,Thu Jun 4 18:03:31 2015 UTC,meh....all grandstanding/positioning for bargaining.  i would never root for the Raiders - just could never see it.  the one team I LOVE to hate (besides the fucking Patsies and anything Eli)
Chargers,38j5c5,IamMrT,2,Thu Jun 4 18:06:07 2015 UTC,"I think the issue is that to me, the AFC rivalry is more with the Broncos or the damn Pats...because the Raiders have been irrelevant since I started watching the Chargers. A lot of the issues with the Raiders came from the Al Davis era (in his prime) that's been dead for so long. I don't feel the same about that team because I didn't witness the evil Raiders era.

Chargers,38j5c5,LukeNeverShaves,1 point,Thu Jun 4 19:45:29 2015 UTC,"No, it's actually not. First of all, as much as the Raiders may have market in LA, they don't have nearly the same one in SD, especially given the rivalry. The only people who would support this are the people who like the idea of having a team but aren't actual fans of it. Second, the only reason that teams are interested in moving is to get the LA market. If Davis doesn't move to LA he's not moving at all. Same with Spanos. And if Kroenke gets there first I doubt anyone else moves. Third, no stadium will be built if the Chargers leave. The city isn't going to come clamoring to attract another team if the Chargers are gone, and Davis is smart enough to know that he won't have the same market here as he will in LA or Oakland. And the city will basically be giving the finger to all of the local fans and lose the small amount we do have. Sure, it might make sense on paper, but it's never going to work. Lastly, the NFL has already said if the Chargers leave they won't put another team in San Diego."

Chargers,38gb1y,ChargersChatPodcast,4,Thu Jun 4 01:38:01 2015 UTC,The Chargers can FT him for like $8.5M next year. Not far off from what he already makes
Chargers,38gb1y,TheFakeTomTelesco,8,Thu Jun 4 04:02:11 2015 UTC,"The price to tag a player is the average of the top 5 salaries at the position OR 120% of the player's salary the previous year, whichever is larger.  Weddle's salary in 2015 is $10.1 million (7.5M base salary plus $2.6M prorated signing bonus - which is included for franchise tag purposes). So I think it would cost $12.12M to tag Weddle next year."

Chargers,38gb1y,jasonwhatis,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:58:48 2015 UTC,"Weddle isn't going to cost $12+ million per year. I'd say $9.

All hypotheticals of course, but I'd rather have a lesser Weddle than some nobody."

Chargers,38gb1y,Beginning_End,11,Thu Jun 4 00:54:24 2015 UTC,He's played special teams his whole career. That takes a toll of his body that isn't justified anymore. The chargers seem to not want to reward him for doing almost everything that he could possibly do for the team. So why would he possibly get hurt play STs when he's going to need a new contract next season
Chargers,38gb1y,TheFakeTomTelesco,8,Thu Jun 4 01:01:42 2015 UTC,"Are you saying that the last contract he was given wasnt a reward for his hard work? Wasnt it like 5yr 40mil? Maybe he should honor that contract and do whats best for the team, and if whats best for the team is for him to play ST and he refuses, hes coming off as selfish"

Now that I'm off in college on the East Coast in Baltimore, it's painful to watch all my friends rep the Ravens or their home teams and all I can do is support my Chargers without any apparel.  The Chargers are my team through and through.

Hopefully we can meet up in the Super Bowl"
Chargers,38cbp3,Hyrdogen,2,Wed Jun 3 14:10:31 2015 UTC,The Packers are definitely the NFC team I find myself constantly rooting for; I would say that they're my favorite NFC team.

The special ones are on ""legends"" contracts which is when the player (like Montana) gets approached by the league or the team and they sign a contract releasing their rights to their name to be sold and they get royalties from each sale."
Chargers,38elyl,timewithoutthee,5,Wed Jun 3 18:48:14 2015 UTC,I saw LT nike game jerseys at the Q store last year.
Chargers,38elyl,pistolpete4407,2,Wed Jun 3 19:09:23 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't expect to see them again until 2017, when he's voted into the HoF.  It probably won't be the classic 90s/early 00s jersey though, just his name printed onto whatever our current is, like this Winslow one. Nike only makes whatever our official set is, so Home/Away/Powder. The league has a deal with another provider for some throwbacks, like this Alworth, but I wouldn't bet on them doing anything like that for LT.  It's a shame, because I'd love to get my hands on a classic Seau or LT jersey."

It seems all you hear about are the 500/lb guys who can't stop eating.  Also for the love of god don't read the comments on that site!!
Chargers,3894sn,veni-veni-veni,3,Tue Jun 2 20:07:58 2015 UTC,Great read! Underscores the amount of dedication he (and any) pro football player has to be competitive. Also highlights the drastic change after their football careers. Pretty crazy to think that they still have about half their lives to live after their pro careers are done. Too difficult a transition for some.
Chargers,3894sn,impactblue5,2,Tue Jun 2 20:07:31 2015 UTC,"It's all about the diet. These guys were elite athletes in their prime and had awesome work ethic. That same work ethic comes with them in retirement and they still hit the gym hard, but without all the meals bulking them up.  Props to Nick. He's living the dream.

Chargers,38b8l0,TheGreatHeisman,19,Wed Jun 3 02:25:16 2015 UTC,I'm sure the Bolts will make an offer but I'm unsure if Weddle will accept
Chargers,38b8l0,zeehrob,3,Wed Jun 3 04:31:39 2015 UTC,I'm going to imagine there will be plenty of teams willing to pay him more. Really hope he accepts our offer though.
Chargers,38b8l0,itsthumper,2,Wed Jun 3 17:27:40 2015 UTC,"""Winning"" in free agency generally means that team was the highest bidder, which generally means they valued them the most. That can mean they over valued, and therefore over paid, for that player.  That is the scenario I see playing out. I imagine Weddle has plenty left in the tank, but will it be at the same level, or when will it drop off, etc? I imagine Telesco wants to avoid having a situation a few years from now where Weddle's play drops off, but he would represent a bunch of dead money if cut.  That and I think he wants to prioritize getting Rivers' contract done and knowing how much money he has to work with for Weddle."
Chargers,38b8l0,BJEdwards,4,Wed Jun 3 18:03:23 2015 UTC,That's... that's a logical perspective.
Chargers,38b8l0,TheFakeTomTelesco,6,Wed Jun 3 04:34:23 2015 UTC,"Yes, I think TT is waiting to see if he has any decline this season before he commits to him long term. I do however think he will test free agency but will end up resigning here. I think both sides are not carrying this out the way they should Weddle's agent should shut the fuck up with all the ""He isn't wanted anymore"" and I think the media and ""Writers"" are going to blow this up the way the Rivers thing was, Weddle is one of my favorite players and I will be very sad if he leaves and I think the FO should get their heads out of their ass's and just pay the man before we lose our Defensive Captain. I recently heard a quote from Rivers saying he misses the ""back and forth"" with Weddle  and that he is listening and watching how they are handling Weddle's contract. Now is not the time to panic, if TT says we don't want him after this year then we can panic."
Chargers,38b8l0,ratpriest,1 point,Wed Jun 3 02:35:10 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I think TT also wants to see if Weddle is not on the decline before we offer him a huge deal. But if Weddle is still doing good, then I don't think TT will let him test FA w/out a deal that Weddle can agree to."
Chargers,38b8l0,SupremeSouthpaw,7,Thu Jun 4 02:59:41 2015 UTC,"I imagine that they had plans to resign him about this time of the year. But, because he had to make a statement about it, they will wait as long as possible. I think they're just not giving in to ""bad"" behavior. At least, that's my theory."

Chargers,38b8l0,myzticaznfool,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:30:56 2015 UTC,"Depends on how he does this season. If he is as good as he was last season, they will probably make a good run at him. If he starts to show any decline, he'll walk probably."
Chargers,38b8l0,esoteryk,1 point,Wed Jun 3 05:07:04 2015 UTC,I think Weddle will take less money to stay tbh
Chargers,38b8l0,Ryan_thecreator,1 point,Wed Jun 3 09:41:26 2015 UTC,"I think the Chargers will make an offer, because the market will be better for signing a safety and he won't be able to command as much.

Jacoby Jones returning kicks. the duo of Flowers and Verrett. Ingram and the impact, if there is one, of his slimming down. Perryman destroying opponents. our sophomore players showing growth and making huge contributions. hopefully a Gates/Green tandem. the resurgence of Felipe Rios.   Basically, ALL THE THINGS."
Chargers,38av10,ace-destrier,5,Wed Jun 3 01:12:15 2015 UTC,"Jacoby Jones   Holy fuck I forgot about this signing, good field position with MGIII Allen and Stevie? Upgraded O line? Our offense is going to be fucking sick"

Chargers,38av10,TheFakeTomTelesco,9,Thu Jun 4 03:04:12 2015 UTC,"We were a few pieces of an O line away from a top 10 offense last year, despite our running back by committee congress situation.   Now we have it.    Call it gambler's fallacy, but it seems doubtful that we will have another ""edge of tomorrow""/""next man down"" situation at RB and Center.  Keenan has proven himself, and by definition, cannot have another sophomore slump.  Floyd and Gates, despite their combined age, are more than capable of high level production, and they are both backed-up by some high quality players.   Rivers is having another kid, which means his power and dad strength is growing by like 1/9th or something.  We may even have a secondary, which is good, because we are definitely leaning into our nickel package.  Liuget is great.  Mathews showed some real flashes.  We have some interesting options for the other end and tackle.  Some guys with low snap counts last year getting good opportunities to step up.  Carrethers may prove to be a nice run-stopping NT with some more reps this season.  (Turns out us dumping Cam Thomas last year was great management, incidentally).  And let's face it - we didn't dislike Liss, but he was a bit undersized.   We have a bright future regarding our inside linebacking situation.    On the outside,  our boy Ingram has hopefully gotten quicker (I'm hoping his self-perceived speed increase translates into sacks and tackles for loss, where he would formerly get hurries).  We've got Attaochu, who didn't look bad last year getting a bit of a promotion.   You may question our pass rush and potentially our line, but I could easily see this as a very above average defense.   Stuckey is also the man.   Last, but certainly not least:  Gordon.  He really gets to thrive a little on the Rocky Balboa principle: it just had to not suck as bad as Rocky V (and it managed to kick its ass, to be honest).  Basically, he just needs to break his shoulders a little less than the last guy and he'll be a hero.  Our expectations are all high, but really, even if he doesn't turn out to be an every down back we hoped for his ROOKIE year, he's got a bright future ahead of him, and we have a deep corps of exciting running backs.  (I'm also optimistic that a decent line will even give Brown a shot at reasonable production.... 2013 Indy seems so far away... but I'm thinking our line might make a huge difference, not to mention what a healthier line seemed to show for Oliver's production).  All in all, guys, our near-term here kicks major ass even if our long-term appears to stand on shaky footing.   (Don't worry about that either... There's a lot of media hype and excitement from LA jackoffs about this.  A lot of what we've seen is solid, cold-hearted negotiation from players, owners, and Fabian ratfucks. )  Edit: A word."
Chargers,38av10,heyimrick,2,Wed Jun 3 03:13:26 2015 UTC,"Honestly that hit the nail right on the head in all aspects. Our MLB situation has me really excited, I've watched a number of Perrimans game film and he's a damn stud. Teo is looking like he's steadily coming into his own as well!"
Chargers,38av10,UHRossy,3,Wed Jun 3 04:38:32 2015 UTC,I'm gonna say it now. I think Donald Brown surprises everyone next season. He's gonna play with a chip on his shoulder and really come out and do some good work.
Chargers,38av10,Hyrdogen,2,Wed Jun 3 08:17:03 2015 UTC,"I know he's been bad, but I get annoyed when people constantly down him. He's got the tools to be good, and he was good at one time. There is no reason (that I can find) he can't return to that form."

Chargers,38av10,miketheblade,-3,Wed Jun 3 15:47:49 2015 UTC,"i'm looking forward to another phenomenal 9-7 season under future Hall of Famers Mike McNorv and Tom Telesco. They seem to have all the answers.   In all honesty: I think this team has enough talent to go 10-6. They have a bit more depth, and have improved in many positions. Front 7 is obviously the biggest issue, other than the fact that McNorv is still the head coach. Hopefully Ingram and Attaochu stay healthy and produce. There's really no reason for this team to not be a wild card team at the vest least. But again, McNorv is still running the show, so he'll find a way to hold them back."
Chargers,38av10,MikeMcNorv,4,Wed Jun 3 03:29:06 2015 UTC,9-7 with the injuries we had is actually really fucking good. 1 win from 10-6

Year before that too if i'm gonna keep it real. But McNorv doesn't enjoy winning, you can disagree now. But just watch how fans turn on him this year, don't know how they haven't already."
Chargers,38av10,cahman,2,Wed Jun 3 04:41:30 2015 UTC,"Mccoy just a run first HC and with our running game last year, basically our entire interior line was full of guys who should be on the streets."

Also, there is no denying that the overall quality of our team improved - Jacoby easily fixes our only ST problem, Franklin and Barksdale fixes our O-line, Verrett isn't coming into the season with an injury, but even so, we added a lot of quality to our secondary."
Chargers,38av10,cahman,-1,Wed Jun 3 05:10:39 2015 UTC,no doubt man. I totally think this team is better than they were in week 17 at KC. Their HC is the only thing that scares me. That and the lack of pass rushers atm.

Chargers,38ak0t,rezyy013,9,Tue Jun 2 23:48:57 2015 UTC,"Missing OTA's was understandable when things were up in the air, but now that there's been a decisive decision, I think Weddle should be at OTAs. Holding out at this point is bratty."

I think weddle should have his ass working out with the team.  Who's to say that it doesn't work out better for both chargers and weddle to renegotiate his contract after the season,  there are lots of players who are chargers this year that won't be next year and that frees up cap space.  I love the chargers,  I love weddle, but like wtf dude,  you are getting paid retarded amount of money to play a game,  you are a football great and will get your money.  I can't stand when players hold out of practice over contracts.    End rant."

I'd rather him be healthy all year,  I'd imagine he will see less snaps this year and they will start working Greene in more but I've thought that for the last two years haha. Weddle is young and being a drama queen,  but still this rumor of Mccoy bad mouthing weddle is about as petty as weddle not showing up because contract crap."

Chargers,38ak0t,BobTaco,2,Tue Jun 2 23:37:48 2015 UTC,"You're right, I guess I should've phrased the title better. I do still think it's relevant though that the coaching staff and Weddle are obviously not on the same page regarding his future, and I think that's the bigger issue."
Chargers,38ak0t,Zack,1 point,Wed Jun 3 01:08:13 2015 UTC,"Coaches don't care about the future. That's the GM's job. The coaches are upset that he made it all public and are taking valuable gelling time away by not being their for OTAs. Saddle really helps the noons on defense...and he is still under contract. That's their issue. Weddle feels disrespected. Chargers are upset he went the route he did by overreacting a bit. A normal person could see Rivers was first in priority, and a normal person realizes if a deal isn't done in FA, it gets dome AFTER the draft. He was bitching since day one. He'd probably have a contract if he didn't bitch. Same for Rivers. They are just making people sweat now because of all the crap they put on the organization in the offseason IMO.  Dishing it back a bit. Keeping people humble and in check. No big deal...yet."

Chargers,38ak0t,latebraker,-1,Wed Jun 3 05:17:16 2015 UTC,this is the last year of his contract   That's generally when teams and players start discussing extensions.
Chargers,38ak0t,smothered-hope,6,Wed Jun 3 05:44:23 2015 UTC,"I am surprised Weddle did this with a big stink and publicly coming out so early saying he wasn't happy and wanted a new deal etc...just seems out of character to be honest. The Chargers have shown that the marquee guys who do the right thing on and off the field get paid, including Weddle who they set a precedent with his contract. If I were to guess this whole thing is why his deal isn't being worked on and Liuget's is."
Chargers,38ak0t,Shinanagan,4,Wed Jun 3 03:21:46 2015 UTC,"I think it's his beard. Remember a few years ago when he was clean-shaven? He was such a nice, regular guy back then.

McCoy doesn't seem the type to do more than address the issue and move on to work.   I think when OTAs are over and Weddle comes in and gets to work, it'll just simply be what it is. A guy playing the last year of his deal as hard as he can to either get a new one, or the more likely option, that he'll be moving elsewhere. Sad for us, but I'm hopeful this won't come to pass."

Meanwhile the Chargers haven't said a thing publicly. Seems this guy likes to negotiate in the media instead of directly with the Chargers.
Chargers,38ak0t,dagonn3,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:56:36 2015 UTC,"totally agree.  but honestly, this is the last big dollar contract he'll sign as an NFL player.  gotta give him that.  reminds me of James Shields - he pitched more innings the last five or so years than everyone else in the Majors, and that was used against him as a FA.    thus he signed a low-ball Pads FA deal, which is still a lot of dough.  but nowhere near what he likely and should have commanded.  Weddle should stop playing on Special Team plays, and focus on defense to save his body and his last big contract.  love the guy, but it is a business (and if Rivers goes, and we move to LA, it's rebuilding mode and Weddle and a large contract would hamper the team in this scenario)"
Chargers,38ak0t,latebraker,3,Thu Jun 4 17:54:52 2015 UTC,"I heard that Rivers told Weddle that McCoy said something about Weddle during a meeting.

Chargers,38aeht,smackjack29,1 point,Wed Jun 3 05:03:32 2015 UTC,That is a little surprising.  Maybe they feel that Watt is just better suited as a guard and want to develop him/ use him for depth.
Chargers,38aeht,predalienmack,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:00:36 2015 UTC,"I sure hope Watt wins out at guard over Troutman so his potential won't be wasted on the bench. We've seen what Troutman can do, which is occasionally shine while most of the time getting wrecked (even by average to below average defenders), so we should give Watt a shot after he played alright at center last year as a rookie, which isn't even his most natural postion. I do think Watt would be best suited for LG though, and I honestly think Franklin's skill set would make him a better RG, but that probably won't happen since recently signed big free agent acquisitions are generally not asked to change positions."

Liuget is a beast...and give this guy an ounce of help on the line so he isn't doubled every play, he is almost certain to get 10 sacks.   Weddle is the shit, but if Liuget walks to any other team, he's a PB or maybe even better player."
Chargers,38467f,BobTaco,16,Mon Jun 1 19:02:28 2015 UTC,"Hate to say it, but Luiget is more valuable than Weddle right now with who we have. There's only a handful of elite safeties in the NFL, and Weddle is one of them, but losing a talent like Luiget would send out front-7 back to the stone age. Great teams don't win with a mediocre defensive front. We need to re-sign him and build around him."
Chargers,38467f,CuteWolves,6,Mon Jun 1 22:52:37 2015 UTC,Been saying it for awhile now. Liuget is younger and plays a more vital position

Chargers,38467f,miketheblade,10,Mon Jun 1 19:27:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah thats what happens when you have Weddle, Liuget, Rivers coming off the books, that's around 30 mil in cap space alone (Rivers is ~17.5mil, Liuget is ~5.5m, and Weddle is ~8.5m this year).  Those are up there with our 3 highest contracts."

Chargers,38467f,Duffman5755,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:16:30 2015 UTC,"Yup, just talked about those three cuz they mentioned them, and Gates, at least I would bet, is probably going to end up retiring, either that or will be taking a huge discount.  He's another nearly 10 mil coming off the books this year."
Chargers,38467f,Duffman5755,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:37:39 2015 UTC,"Also add Butler to the mix if he continues to suck. That'd be our top 5 (for 2015) coming off the cap. Anyway, the cap situation is very purdy. It sure makes a difference to have a GM that finds value in cheap signings and hands out the big contracts to players who deserve it. I mean, signings have gone wrong (Cox), and it could happen for one of Flowers, Franklin or Dunlap, but ain't no one arguing against those moves in the present."
Chargers,38467f,Swill311,2,Mon Jun 1 20:53:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, something we did VERY well was that we have cut bait with guys that we gave bad deals to, or just didn't live up to them.  But there's no way at all that we cut Butler this year.  We basically have a deal worked in with him that after 3 years, we can cut him free of any penalty and its essentially year by year after that, as all his guarantees are roster bonuses, no guaranteed money IIRC, so he's at least playing out 3 years on his contract, or else we basically get no benefit from cutting him.  Yeah, TT has done way more right than he has done wrong so far, I really can't argue with him at this point."
Chargers,38467f,pick6and1,9,Mon Jun 1 21:11:00 2015 UTC,"Can we extend Gates too, please don't retire old man Gates I want to see every one of Gonzalez's records broken."
Chargers,38467f,SunriseSurprise,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:18:15 2015 UTC,"I feel like gates would have to play another 4 or 5 years for that to happen assuming there are no injuries, and I don't see that happening.

Chargers,38467f,TweetPoster,2,Mon Jun 1 19:11:34 2015 UTC,I think he means media/public focus.
Chargers,38467f,CuteWolves,4,Mon Jun 1 19:31:56 2015 UTC,"How much is Liuget worth per year? I'm guessing $6-7 million. I'm hoping for that, but it'll probably be closer to $8 million."
Chargers,38467f,jasonwhatis,3,Mon Jun 1 20:21:44 2015 UTC,"That's a good question.  It's so hard to project in large part because of the impact of guaranteed money.  You may be right, especially based on the amount of money Telesco gave Butler, but I really hope you're wrong.  $8 mill per year would make Liuget a top 5 paid 3-4 DE and I don't think his production merits anything close to projecting that sort of value. In my opinion, a 4 year $20 mill deal with relatively modest guaranteed money would be more than fair. Any more than that and I'm probably not going to be too happy with the contract."
Chargers,38467f,miketheblade,2,Mon Jun 1 21:40:29 2015 UTC,I imagine he gets paid more than Butler. We might cut butler next year and give it to Corey I am down with that. With the addition of Perryman

Chargers,38467f,miketheblade,3,Mon Jun 1 18:55:52 2015 UTC,"I agree, although I think McCoy is willing to let Weddle leave if they can't negotiate on a reasonable price."
Chargers,38467f,jasonwhatis,5,Mon Jun 1 19:24:44 2015 UTC,"Fucking great news. We need to keep Liuget.  Weddle, on the other hand, unfortunately needs to understand that elite safeties decline around his age. What I just wish he'd do, instead of holding out, is go out there and prove all of us wrong. Take another step forward. Give us all a reason to feel comfortable in giving him another big contract, while aging into his 30s."
Chargers,38467f,Hyrdogen,3,Mon Jun 1 22:56:20 2015 UTC,that elite safeties decline around his age   Wut? Its arguably the longest lasting position in the NFL (besides kickers). FS's can play well into their 30's no problem.
Chargers,38467f,PACH7676,2,Mon Jun 1 21:15:55 2015 UTC,Weddle is only a FS by title.   The dude plays like a LB. He takes too much of a pounding not to decline.
Chargers,384nam,HeadleysHobos,19,Mon Jun 1 20:44:41 2015 UTC,"I have nothing but love and respect for the Beard, he's been the heart and soul of a mediocre defense for so long that I'm scared to think of that secondary without him. His one-armed interception that got called back against Denver last year was magic. I'll never forget the guy, even if this is his last year.  This is the trouble with exceptional players like him, when they get older, their team's have pay a lot of money to risk it and hope the wheels don't come off the bus.   Telesco knows his age and his risk of injury are only increasing. We'll get diminishing returns and he wants that money. We love the guy, but we can only love him so much and if he's not willing to consider taking a little less, we may have to say goodbye.   I suspect they'll settle on him taking a small raise after dragging him over the coals to get the best deal out of him. Settle on 5 years, frontloaded with guarantees that disappear to almost nothing by year 3.  We've got him this year and we can franchise tag him next year if we feel strongly that we can work it out. I hope we do. He's worth the risk."

Chargers,384nam,gshortelljr,2,Mon Jun 1 23:33:57 2015 UTC,"If Rivers is signed to an extension, sure"
Chargers,384nam,predalienmack,2,Tue Jun 2 03:57:05 2015 UTC,"I partially agree with you, but the biggest thing to consider is that Luiget has never realized his potential for being a top 10 DE, and has mostly resided in the bottom half of the league for starting dlinemen, particularly against the run, while Weddle started as a solid starter and has progressed to become arguably the best and most complete safety in the league...should Luiget really be a priority when we'd be paying for potential and not results like we would be with Rivers and Weddle?"
Chargers,384nam,CuteWolves,4,Mon Jun 1 23:33:36 2015 UTC,"TT knows that Luiget will become a star once we get a player half as decent as him on the DL. He's constantly doubled (even tripled) teamed on the field every week, and STILL manages to make plays.   He's also about to enter his prime years. He's always been healthy and should become a Pro Bowl DE if we build around him. We will never win a championship without at least an average front 7. Luiget will be our cornerstone."
Chargers,384nam,predalienmack,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:37:52 2015 UTC,"I hope you're right. The think is that most pro bowl caliber (ignoring the subjectivity of elections to pro bowls) 3-4 DEs are guys that often excel despite the talent around them, and Luiget has just been an average player with a few awesome highlights with admittedly fledgling talent in the rest of the front seven. I fear that we will pay him top 10 DE money to be a top 25 player on the field, even after upgrades around him."
Chargers,384nam,CuteWolves,2,Tue Jun 2 00:25:04 2015 UTC,"True; it is possible he just ends up with an average career, despite us paying him top dollar."
Chargers,384nam,predalienmack,1 point,Tue Jun 2 01:12:03 2015 UTC,"Obviously we're all hoping otherwise, I just haven't seen enough consistency to put so much faith into him developing into a player worth top $."
Chargers,384nam,SupremeSouthpaw,7,Tue Jun 2 05:10:39 2015 UTC,"The Chargers can still exclusively franchise tag him next year and pay him like a top 5 safety, and no other team can negotiate with him. This year its at $9,618,00 for any franchised safety, and it will go up next year as the other top 5 safety contracts go up. I love Weddle and I hope they retain him without it coming to this, but this report is not the end of the world."
Chargers,384nam,Crestylia,7,Mon Jun 1 21:44:59 2015 UTC,"Great point. The team loses little by using tag as Weddle's salary demand was probably more than tag at $9,618,000."
Chargers,384nam,BJEdwards,2,Mon Jun 1 21:51:15 2015 UTC,"An ""exclusive"" franchise player must be offered a one-year contract for an amount no less than the average of the top five salaries at the player's position as of a date in April of the current year in which the tag will apply, or 120 percent of the player's previous year's salary, whichever is greater.   Source  Weddle has the highest salary this year of the safeties. I think the other safeties will need a pretty big boost in salary for the average to surpass 120% of his salary for this year, so Telesco probably feels pretty confident in knowing exactly how much it will cost to tag Weddle. Rivers is more of a variable to tag."
Chargers,384nam,SupremeSouthpaw,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:45:32 2015 UTC,"Yes, I was more assuming a deal with Rivers would get done, given he is more important to this franchise. If no deal is reached with either then Rivers gets the tag.   As for Weddle being franchised, 120% of his $8,000,000 dollar contract would be $9,618,000. Only Earl Thomas and Jairus Byrd would have bigger contracts in 2016. In 2017 Devin McCourty would be making more than that number as well."
Chargers,384nam,ChargersChatPodcast,3,Mon Jun 1 23:20:16 2015 UTC,But Weddle's salary in 2015 is $10.1 million (7.5M base salary plus $2.6M prorated signing bonus - which is included for franchise tag purposes).  So I think it would cost $12.12M to tag Weddle.
Chargers,384nam,SupremeSouthpaw,1 point,Tue Jun 2 00:12:17 2015 UTC,Ahhhh you are correct. I was looking at the average yearly pay of the contract.   Well with that if he was franchised next year he would be the highest paid safety in the league if he got the 120% deal of the franchise tag.
Chargers,384nam,sdsupersean,1 point,Tue Jun 2 00:14:24 2015 UTC,"Franchise him? I'm not so sure, not yet. Both Weddle and Rivers will be out of contract. If neither of them is willing to deal, we lose one guaranteed, and I'm betting Rivers gets the tag."
Chargers,384nam,SupremeSouthpaw,5,Mon Jun 1 22:39:18 2015 UTC,I agree that if no contract extension is met with Rivers before next year they would franchise him over Weddle. I was assuming a deal with Rivers would get done with how vastly important he is to this franchise.

Chargers,384nam,LukeNeverShaves,7,Mon Jun 1 20:49:29 2015 UTC,Why are we overreacting so much. We do know that Free Agency is a long time off and lots of stuff can happen like Weddle getting an extension before free agency. Just because they arent giving one now doesnt mean he is gone. I fucking hate the offseason and all these BS articles that just stir up drama for months. Preseason please hurry.
Chargers,384nam,BobTaco,27,Mon Jun 1 21:31:29 2015 UTC,Guys...this is an Acee article. Settle down. TT isn't a moron...at least so far.
Chargers,384nam,myzticaznfool,7,Mon Jun 1 21:00:11 2015 UTC,"Acee made some good points on 1090. 31yo next year with lots of mileage on the body. Weddle plays special teams too. I think ultimate he will take less money and stay next free agency. TT is a moron if he wasn't concerned, doesn't mean he won't bring him back."
Chargers,384nam,fucky0urkarma,-1,Mon Jun 1 23:08:57 2015 UTC,you think he's going to completely change his mind in a year?
Chargers,384nam,myzticaznfool,2,Tue Jun 2 02:37:32 2015 UTC,"Weddle clearly wants to stay here. TT is not talking extension doesn't mean he doesn't want Weddle back, just not at an inflated value. I love Weddle, but possibly overpaying for an aging player while having many holes on our defense is a tough call. That's why none of us are GMs to make these decisions."
Chargers,384nam,og_sandiego,3,Tue Jun 2 03:39:32 2015 UTC,"i like Acee, and Canepa.    But that assmunch Matt Calkins?!??!  not so much (except for his 'open letter' to Deano - that was a good write-up)"
Chargers,384nam,TheFakeTomTelesco,3,Mon Jun 1 21:24:47 2015 UTC,Canepa's good for a chuckle and some bolt-jerking every once in a while.  His report cards are usually pretty fun.

Chargers,384nam,Zack,-3,Mon Jun 1 22:36:55 2015 UTC,"He's probably going to bust a VJax and hold out.   I think the Weddle era is over for us in SD, sadly."
Chargers,384nam,SanDiegoDude,3,Mon Jun 1 21:16:44 2015 UTC,"That would be really stupid on Weddle's part if he does, considering he's still under contract this year. Weddle just wants to get a deal locked in while the Safeties are getting huge contracts right now (which I don't blame him one bit) - I seriously doubt TT would let Weddle get anywhere near FA, unless he gets so bitter over this he refuses to work with the team next year."
Chargers,384nam,BarbaricMind,8,Mon Jun 1 22:08:53 2015 UTC,This just makes me very very sad. He has been the heart and spirit of our defense for quite a while now. I hope this is just some smoke screen or something because I don't know what I'll do if he leaves.
Chargers,384nam,Big_Ugly_Cripple,6,Mon Jun 1 21:03:17 2015 UTC,If we manage to extend Rivers and Liuget this before the season starts i will not be worried. Weddle is already payed like a top safety to franchise tagging him next year wouldnt be a big deal at all.
Chargers,384nam,weedb0ng,6,Mon Jun 1 20:54:20 2015 UTC,"If weddle holds out, fuck him. Seriously, he is making 10 million this year. What is wrong with him? You're set for life with this years earnings alone. Stop being greedy dude. You signed the best safety contract at the time, fulfill it."
Chargers,384nam,kr0kodil,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:08:14 2015 UTC,He's not gonna hold out. He's skipping voluntary OTAs. So is Gates.
Chargers,384nam,crustycupcakes,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:41:53 2015 UTC,For different reasons though.
Chargers,384nam,HeavensentLXXI,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:52:32 2015 UTC,"First of all, the bro is thinking about his future. He knows that 10 million for this season will be his no matter what. OTAs aren't required, so it's okay. Don't hate on him.  Second of all, we could step up and pay him too. He's done everything we could want from him and more. It's risky to lock him down long term, but he's shown he can be reliable and the best in the league. If there's a guy besides Phil to extend, Eric is it.  He may or may not feel slighted, but he's definitely earned the right to be paid. If not by us after this season, then by another team. He's not the bad guy, especially since he'll play his last year on the deal because he has no choice."
Chargers,384nam,JohnnyChee,0,Tue Jun 2 00:51:08 2015 UTC,He was voted 1st team all-pro literally 5 months ago. I think he's allowed to ask for more money.

Chargers,384nam,MarcoCheng,2,Mon Jun 1 20:46:24 2015 UTC,"I love Weddle a lot, but I'd be hesitant to extend his contract immediately as well. He's already entering the wrong side of 30 and is already one of the highest paid safties in the league (and probably wants more). I also don't know why some people are calling for Telesco's head already: he's alreay working with Rivers and Liuget. Plus, Weddle has this year to prove himself; he can't (and won't) hold out. However, if he gets injured and/or has a huge decline in performance, he's pretty much gone.  The best case scenario is if they settle Rivers' and Liuget's contracts, and then just tag Weddle. He'll get his money, while the Chargers get milk the last out of his elite years without the risk in investing for a player (who will most likely decline) for multiple years"
Chargers,384nam,GaboKopiBrown,2,Tue Jun 2 00:56:57 2015 UTC,WHY CAN'T WE HAVE A NICE SECONDARY?  sobs
Chargers,384nam,myzticaznfool,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:56:01 2015 UTC,"Maybe having Flowers and Verrett makes Weddle expendable and focus more on pass rush with next year's cap space? In a perfect world, I rather have a stronger front 7 than a straonger secondary. That said, I don't think you should let the heart and soul of the defense go."
Chargers,384nam,tarcoal,1 point,Mon Jun 1 21:41:17 2015 UTC,He could still get franchised or come to terms but he's also going to turn 31 during the season and he makes like 10M a year. Telesco maybe doesn't want to resign him... players don't usually get better after 30.
Chargers,384nam,highastronaut,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:44:15 2015 UTC,I trust TT. I'm sure with a decision this big he knows what he is doing.

Chargers,384nam,joshc82,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:47:24 2015 UTC,"I look at this as a positive. Most players have their best season statistically going in to a contract year. While we may not have him locked up beyond this year, we may be getting his best season overall before he gets his payday."
Chargers,384nam,zerorules,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:31:36 2015 UTC,"This is a good move by the Chargers.  Weddle got his big contract.  We ALREADY paid him.  He performed very well, but I believe he is the top paid safety in the league already.  There is no need to give him another huge contract.  He is also getting up there in age.  I love the guy but he over played his hand here.  I am glad we didnt give in to this.  TBH I am losing a bit of respect for him because he tried to play this card.  He acts like he has been a steal for years out playing his contract which is not at all true.  He simply lived up to a contract people though the Chargers were crazy to give him in the first place."
Chargers,384nam,TheRisingTide,0,Tue Jun 2 18:46:36 2015 UTC,"Welp. You can hope this is only the case until Rivers and Liuget are locked up, but uh... Yeah, you'd have to be oblivious not to see that and the whole franchise tag as leverage against paying Weddle his market value.  Sadly, this is probably it for Weddle as a Charger. =/"

Chargers,384nam,froggy184,-1,Mon Jun 1 22:12:40 2015 UTC,"Look, he's too old to give him the Safety version of the max contract.  He was a bit of a late bloomer, and that basically put his career into this situation.  If you come out of college highly touted, picked early in the draft, and perform as expected you can get two big contracts after your rookie deal.  That wasn't his path.  He got the one, and nobody else is going to give it to him next year due to age, and so he probably gets franchised a couple times, and he's done.  Maybe he signs a ""prove it"" deal with somebody else after being franchised, but that's how it looks for him."
Chargers,384nam,BeerFarts86,-2,Mon Jun 1 21:34:52 2015 UTC,"I love TT but the way he is doing things is coy and is really pissing me off...Just pay the man, Please, come on."
Chargers,384nam,TheFakeTomTelesco,-14,Mon Jun 1 21:59:09 2015 UTC,What have we learned this offseason from the Chargers?     They lie  They LIE They don't give a damn about their fans They think they can just go pick up an all pro safety off the street. No problem.   Edit-why the downvotes? What have I said that is wrong?
Chargers,384nam,og_sandiego,7,Mon Jun 1 21:12:05 2015 UTC,"why the downvotes? What have I said that is wrong?    You're lumping the GM and the owner in the same ""screw-the-fans"" group here. You're assuming that not extending Weddle this year means we'll let him walk.  Let's see how he does - he's trying to leverage a pro-bowl year in his contract negotiations - it makes sense to let him play out this year, and if need be, franchise tag him next year if he's still producing (he's already getting paid like 12 billion unicorn souls or something ridiculous).  If he gets hurt this year, we're geniuses.  If he gets tagged next year, we haven't lost a ton of money and haven't mortgaged ourselves for an aging defensive back.  This is a low-priority contract until next year. You're bringing a negative vibe that is not conducive to good discussion - if you disagree rationally, then make your case."
Chargers,384nam,Zack,3,Mon Jun 1 21:31:33 2015 UTC,they're in the game to win.  winning means not showing your hand too early....so many moving parts
Chargers,384nam,BeerFarts86,-2,Mon Jun 1 21:26:01 2015 UTC,Probably drafted Mager in the 3rd round to replace Weddle.
Chargers,384nam,Zack,-2,Mon Jun 1 21:14:14 2015 UTC,Who cares? Why in the name of hell would they be okay with letting the anchor of one of the best secondaries in football walk?  He makes everyone on that defense better.    I am not comfortable with replacing an all pro with a 3rd rd pick from Texas State college of wherever.  Edit- I'm getting Zacked!!
Chargers,384nam,kondor35,0,Mon Jun 1 21:21:55 2015 UTC,Me neither but drafting him in the 3rd when he was projected to go in the 4th or 5th is suspicious to me. Then this issue with Weddle is going on...

Chargers,384nam,MikeMcNorv,2,Mon Jun 1 21:31:40 2015 UTC,Franchise tag him next year and I bet we don't lose money.  He's screaming for a new contract after a pro-bowl year when everyone is getting big money - you bet your ass he's gunning for a top 5 contract.  It's smart - he's a low priority contract for us this offseason.  Next year it'll get more interesting if we don't tag him.
Chargers,384nam,TheFakeTomTelesco,0,Mon Jun 1 22:30:39 2015 UTC,franchise tagging him will cost like 12m. and that's assuming Rivers and Liuget are under contract.

Chargers,386f93,rezyy013,8,Tue Jun 2 05:58:33 2015 UTC,"Not the best at pass coverage. However, I really like how he tackles. It's smart tackling. Goes for the legs/thighs grabs, wraps and rolls them down to the ground. That's whty he can stop the run. It's not the big hits. This style of tackling keeps everyone's heads out of the picture and keeps people safer. Like how they takle in rugby."
Chargers,386f93,BobTaco,3,Tue Jun 2 07:21:40 2015 UTC,This. I also like his hustle. When he blitzed Winston and he rolled out and got rid of it to the WR you'll notice Perryman put on the jets and got right to the WR. We don't know how the DC has plays drawn up or how much control the players are allowed to make adjustments. He could easily be told to stay in the tackle box no more then 8 yards off the LOS. The only major pass play he was part of Winston threaded it between him and another player and Perryman has to break off a TE to go towards the WR so its hard to judge.
Chargers,386f93,LukeNeverShaves,2,Tue Jun 2 14:56:58 2015 UTC,Only play I didn't really like was when he lowered his head to spear the runner but lost his speed in the process. Easy mistake but it cost them a touchdown.

Chargers,386f93,BobTaco,3,Wed Jun 3 09:17:45 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if I am not watching the same film as most people here, but he will be a liability in coverage.  He will be better than what we have in run downs.  Even when he gets beat in coverage, he still takes smart angles to the football.  He cannot play contain the the NFL level.  He will be a beast inside, but needs some work in coverage.  I imagine Teo will get a lot of the ILB play during passing downs as there is usually only 1 ILB on the field during nickel an dime situations."
Chargers,386f93,pick6and1,2,Tue Jun 2 06:04:28 2015 UTC,"We usually had 2 linebackers in nickel. 4-2-5 formation. Te'o and Connor or Gachkar, depending on the situation. Gachkar is gone, but we still have Connor.  I agree that Perryman projects as a 2-down linebacker. Teams are gonna target him when he's in coverage. Hopefully Butler returns to form and we can play him on passing downs this year."

Chargers,384x0a,miketheblade,2,Tue Jun 2 01:24:59 2015 UTC,"You heard wrong.  Barksdale is quick enough to set the edge, unlike Fluker last year. Barksdale's problem is that he lets guys cross his face and beat him inside at times.  But that's not a footspeed issue.  It's a conditioning and technique issue that surfaced in 2014 after an oustanding 2013.  Fluker's skill-set indicates that he'll probably always struggle with speed rushers at tackle, but he'll be an outstanding right guard once he makes the switch."
Chargers,384x0a,kr0kodil,1 point,Tue Jun 2 22:22:57 2015 UTC,Either way I'm pumped for our improved o-line!

Chargers,384cgf,Irotasm,11,Mon Jun 1 19:35:35 2015 UTC,"Team.  Please welcome Lowell Rose - legendary CB from Miami who started every game in Miami's ""bench coverage"" package.  To be fair, he did play part of a game last season, but we will not hold that against him, and think he'll fit in just fine with our oddly deep, and questionably talented backup secondary.  Now folks, I know we're all ready for the next season to begin, and are rather anxious about the ""big 3"" remaining contracts (and a retirement party we hope gets canceled).  I want you to remember in these trying times that Rome wasn't built in a day.  It was built in several days.  And they weren't using off-brand legos, like me.  Cheap, second-rate, but surprisingly impactful off-brand legos.  Now get it together, team!  We've got a championship to win!  I'd like us to have a tough time re-signing Weddle because he's negotiating with a ring and about 90 interceptions next season.  Let's see what kind of depth we can build up to help get us there."

Chargers,384cgf,Sprinklesss,0,Mon Jun 1 23:22:49 2015 UTC,How many CBs do they need? Would have thought an OT would be more important given how the o-line imploded last season because of injuries.
Chargers,384cgf,BobTaco,8,Mon Jun 1 20:40:20 2015 UTC,"So a UDFA OT is gonna help that  People forget that we signed 3 different OT's this year in FA's (Dunlap, Hairston, Barksdale, and even a 4th, as Franklin started at LT in college and RT for years in Denver), and 4 of our 5 staring OL have started multiple seasons at OT."
Chargers,384cgf,Duffman5755,2,Mon Jun 1 22:28:21 2015 UTC,"I'm fine with testing out a bunch of CBs. Trust in TT and all, but save for B.Flo, TT doesn't have the best record with FA CBs."
Chargers,384cgf,ace-destrier,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:26:46 2015 UTC,Who are the marks against TT at CB? Derek Cox is the only one who comes to mind. Who else am I blanking on?

Chargers,384cgf,BJEdwards,2,Tue Jun 2 04:36:23 2015 UTC,"Fair point. I don't hold Cox against Telesco either, really. IIRC, Cox was one of the better FA CBs available. It just stings how awful those guys turned out to be. I think it's more like TT just couldn't catch a break with FA CBs until Flowers came along."

Chargers,389kgo,BoltingUpSince91,10,Tue Jun 2 19:55:37 2015 UTC,Hitting free agency does not mean parting ways.

Chargers,389kgo,Pufft,3,Tue Jun 2 20:08:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think whoever wrote the thing misinterpreted what his agent meant when he said he'll hit free agency. In all likelihood Eric will hit free agency and then re-sign.   His agent didn't say they will part ways, the articles author did."
Chargers,389kgo,BobTaco,3,Tue Jun 2 20:14:36 2015 UTC,"Like Flowers and Dunlap did this offseason. Free agency just means contract has expired. Nothing more, nothing less."
Chargers,389kgo,ace-destrier,2,Tue Jun 2 20:57:35 2015 UTC,True. Let's hope it's just more rumors
Chargers,389kgo,Beginning_End,2,Tue Jun 2 20:38:39 2015 UTC,"And when speaking of ""the sides"", that implies Weddle and the Chargers have agreed to part ways. Doubtful that, at this time, the Chargers have definitively decided, ""You're ours for the year, and then see ya."" What an irresponsible conclusion for the writer to come to."
Chargers,389kgo,Velocity17,1 point,Tue Jun 2 20:57:22 2015 UTC,"You nailed it.  Here's my perspective on what the situation means.  If the Chargers were certain they were getting rid of Weddle, it's rather likely they would have been looking to cash in on him, not only to get something out of their investment for the future but also to save themselves from paying out the final year of his contract.   Because that didn't even seem to be a whisper, my guess is that there is no plan what-so-ever in place to simply part ways and instead it's just a wait and see year because Weddle is getting older at a position that falls off pretty rapidly without a whole lot of warning.   While I love having Weddle on the team and hope he retires a Charger, right now he's the highest paid safety in the NFL. It's a legitimate question to ask just how much he has left in the tank considering he'll be 31 by the end of next season and it'll be a really tough business decision on how much you want to offer a guy who may only have a couple years left in the tank and will likely be asking for top 5 money despite that fact."

Chargers,385lpc,baconbomb138,7,Tue Jun 2 00:42:09 2015 UTC,you guys need to calm down his contract isnt ending today just wait to see the outcome
Chargers,385lpc,Ramseen,6,Tue Jun 2 03:43:25 2015 UTC,"Sure Weddle is the MAN and I'd love him to retire a Charger, and Tom Telesco agrees.  But one thing about TT, he's here to make our team a SUPERBOWL CHAMPION.  He makes all the hard decisions.  If signing Weddle to a new contract next year helps us keep / sign guys THIS year, then Weddle should just buck up and play his heart out this season.  Get an even better deal next season.  Love that TT is not afraid to go against the Reddit hive mind.  This guy is a professional GM, smart, can spot good talent.  He knows more about football than any person on this forum."
Chargers,385lpc,mikespimpin,5,Tue Jun 2 16:35:15 2015 UTC,Weddle is the only safety in the NFL named first or second-team All-Pro for five straight seasons.   This dude is so garbage.  SOOOOOOO overrated and overpaid. /s  just kidding E-dub don't leave plz
Chargers,385lpc,mikenesser,2,Tue Jun 2 14:52:53 2015 UTC,This is why I can't believe I've read people who are okay with letting him walk.  He's not good - he's one of the best.  Not likely to go from one of the best to waste of roster space in one or two years.
Chargers,385lpc,dunkster91,2,Tue Jun 2 17:05:29 2015 UTC,He'll be 31 almost 32 when his next contract starts. Not many players perform better at the end of their career. Sorry Weddle's gone unless Rivers sign extension then you can use FT on Weddle

Chargers,385lpc,themexicancharger,2,Tue Jun 2 13:36:53 2015 UTC,"Yes, and TT knows it too. Not signing Weddle to an extension doesn't mean the team doesn't recognize his importance and is therefore letting him walk. They are trying to do what is best for the team financially. TT has given us no reason to doubt him before, and this minor decision shouldn't change that."
Chargers,386ug2,TheMilt,18,Tue Jun 2 07:17:59 2015 UTC,Lol behind Palmer? He got injured and didn't finish the season...  Rivers also had no o-line or run game...and still had that 49ers game of pure epicness. Must have based his season on the Miami game only.

My dad insisted I take mace but I didn't feel like sneaking it in, so I didn't. And of course.... Nothing happened.

Chargers,383brt,MyWifesABobcat,2,Mon Jun 1 18:11:30 2015 UTC,"It is really dependent on his performance this year honestly. If he stays the same/improves, he will get his, but in no way will he get this money if he regresses simply because he is a franchise QB. He has a beast O-LINE this year so there is little room for excuses for poor performances.  EDIT: I'm not saying Rivers has had poor performances in the past, all I am saying is that if he shows signs of aging, it might not be smart to give him a long term, big money deal. Shit."

Chargers,383brt,crustycupcakes,1 point,Tue Jun 2 00:00:45 2015 UTC,You people realize these players hire an agent to squeeze teams for the most amount of money possible. Your drinking some rediculous koolaid if you think Rivers is going to take any kind of significant hometown discount. Especially with the state of the Franchise possibly moving up the 5. Even the most mediocre QB's (Dalton) or QB's who still really haven't proven anything (Tannehil and Newton) are getting huge bucks. Agents understand theres a finite amount of realistic franchise QB's and they will capitalize on that short supply for every QB they represent.
Chargers,383brt,ksurf619,2,Mon Jun 1 18:26:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and he's got 7 kids to feed."
Chargers,383brt,BurritoCon,0,Tue Jun 2 15:36:20 2015 UTC,"Not as much.  He already cashed in on his big contract, and he's probably got 2-3 good years left before we see a significant decline in his play.  He's already cashed in on his big deal a few years back, so I'd expect something around what he's making now, maybe a little bit less even, but somewhere in that 15-20 mil region sounds right."
Chargers,383brt,Duffman5755,0,Mon Jun 1 16:35:59 2015 UTC,http://overthecap.com/position/quarterback/  Most likely range looks to be between $19.250M (Tannehill) and $21.85M (Big Ben) yearly.   I'd wager just a bit under Roethlisberger. QB's in this league have tremendous amount of leverage.   Beginning of the off-season I was hoping he'd take a home-town discount for us to be more competitive but after the whole retirement noise it appears he's looking to maximize his earnings for this last contract.

Chargers,380gpl,BJEdwards,5,Sun May 31 23:35:20 2015 UTC,"The part of the suit the article thought worth quoting:   The city’s refusal to provide the records sought by Voice’s first two [public records] requests lacks any substantive or evidentiary justification and instead relies upon an unreasonable suspension of belief – namely, that a small city may interact with multi-billion dollar organizations like the NFL and the teams without the production of a single email, text message or letter, even those relating to public hearings which the city has already held in approving the stadium project without a vote of its citizenry and circumventing CEQA.   Emphasis mine. That seems like what could be the key part, if it reveals something that slows down the project. Carson is already supposed to be behind Kroenke's Inglewood plan, and so a slow down could kill the project.  What is interesting is how something similar seems to be going down with San Diego and the Chargers as well. Carson may have been in on the deal, instead of being a real alternative or being unwittingly used as leverage by the Chargers against San Diego.  One of the theories Bolts from the Blue has are similar to my own thinking. In exchange for helping the NFL in wrangling Kroenke by presenting another option, and giving up the LA market, they must be getting something in return, which I think could be help in securing the Mexico market."

Chargers,381p11,agryan12,3,Mon Jun 1 12:02:03 2015 UTC,Who doesnt Love them some Woodhead....  We know we will see tons of him this season i was posting this thread just to see if anybody thought Oliver might feel like a new back behind a better line
Chargers,381p11,agryan12,1 point,Tue Jun 2 00:34:36 2015 UTC,"I think we will see about the same amount of his this year as we did last year.  He will have a great game here or there, but for the most part he will be just another back.    I love the guy, and he had some of the most surprising runs of the season that made me scream at the TV, but I don't think the new line will give him anymore of an advantage than it will to Gordon or Woodhead, so it will be more of the same from him (and I'm not complaining one bit!), just on a more consistent basis."
Chargers,381p11,Hyrdogen,2,Tue Jun 2 08:55:13 2015 UTC,"Wait, are you saying that Rivers does not fit the bill as a mobile QB? Did you see his moves the first 6 games of last year?  I'm joking btw Brown still can catch out of the backfield, but i'm interested in seeing if gordon can be a good check down option or if the year starts with woodhead as the 3rd down back. I'm guessing woodhead will start the year as checkdown option 1"
Chargers,381p11,SDBoltsy,30,Mon Jun 1 15:15:44 2015 UTC,"Did we watch the same player last year? Personally I do not think finesse and speed/quickness are Oliver's strengths. I think he's very physical and has a knack for shaking off tackles, but I'd hardly call him fast.  While I think he'll have a much better season behind our re-tooled line this year, Melvin Gordon is the future right now, and I'll take Gordon any day of the week over Oliver, no offense to Oliver.  Oliver will make a very good 3rd/insurance RB though."

Chargers,381p11,Duffman5755,6,Tue Jun 2 02:34:16 2015 UTC,"He was absolutely OUTSTANDING at making a guy miss in tight spaces (in the hole/backfield specifically, I haven't seen a guy make as many people miss when getting hit behind the line as he did, which is why he was so much better than Brown this year IMO).  His strengths weren't necessarily a fast/finesse runner, but he does have outstanding short area burst/quickness.  But his best asset by far is his balance and low center of gravity, which just makes him so damn hard to square up, especially when matched with his quickness."
Chargers,381p11,SDBoltsy,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:29:47 2015 UTC,Yeah I agree with you. I've always preached Oliver as being difficult to tackle and a tough runner because of his size. I was just replying to OP's comment on Oliver's speed. It's not there but he has great burst through the hole and physicality.
Chargers,381p11,Duffman5755,2,Mon Jun 1 21:50:10 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, I just think that the agility and lateral quickness is something that some people understate for him.  The long speed isn't really very good at all, but his short area quickness is awesome."

Chargers,381p11,SDBoltsy,1 point,Mon Jun 1 14:13:40 2015 UTC,"You're right, it is college where the speed of the game is noticeably slower than in the NFL. I didn't mean that Oliver has absolutely no quickness or agility, because I think most decent running backs do, but I'm just saying that from what I saw last year, he doesn't seem like the shifty poor man's Sproles that so many were deeming him to be. Apart from being shorter than your average NFL back and wearing #43, their games could not be more different.  I see Oliver as a between-the-tackles pound the rock type of guy. Doesn't have the explosiveness that Gordon brings but he's an extremely solid all-around back for an UDFA that's going to be the main backup for us this year. I just think saying he has speed is a stretch. He has standard NFL speed but he hasn't flashed anything that Gordon flashed at Wisconsin.  Here's to hoping I'm wrong and that Oliver has worked on his atheleticism this offseason and we turn out to have the most athletic backfield in the league!"
Chargers,381p11,miketheblade,0,Mon Jun 1 16:19:51 2015 UTC,The kid is fast. He is faster than Matthews in pads. Fuck 40's he beat Matthews career long of 34 his rook year lol.
Chargers,381p11,SDBoltsy,2,Mon Jun 1 19:17:07 2015 UTC,I'd have to disagree with you there. I consider Mathews to be really explosive. Although he never had a long run I felt like he had a really nice burst through the hole/turning the corner.  I can't see Oliver outrunning many people either. Oliver is definitely quicker and has more finesse moves but Mathews has a way different running style.
Chargers,381p11,sdsupersean,1 point,Mon Jun 1 21:48:12 2015 UTC,"We love to hate Mathews here, but when healthy he was a top 10, sometimes top 5 RB. I don't think his skills should ever be questioned, just his durability.  I like Oliver a lot. His lateral burst is pretty damn amazing. But based off what we've seen so far he's not going to be a #1 back. But who knows... he was an UDFA rookie last year and performed better than anyone expected. I eagerly wait to see his development."

Ideally we'd have something like baseball's WAR) rating of the missing player (namely the starter) and took the difference of that and the replacement's rating for a given week, I think that would be even more telling of how much a team was affected by injury.

Then, over the years, as we got further and further from Marty's S&C staff, as we picked up personnel that were never under them, we fell apart, and turned into a team that couldn't play all 4 quarters ourselves.  Marty & his S&C coaches made the Chargers into men made of solid steel.  Norv's S&C Coaches & Program let them melt back into slag.

Chargers,37vbws,Duffman5755,4,Sat May 30 21:38:49 2015 UTC,"There's so much wrong with this post that I don't know where to begin.  First, the ""training staff"" has very little to do with this.  Its actually probably more on the strength and conditioning staff than anything.  The Athletic Training staff generally has very little to do with injury prevention, and while they can do some movement screening stuff, its up to the S&C coaches to incorporate that into exercises to correct some muscle imbalance and preventative stuff.  Second the Addae thing has always baffled me.  Nothing would actually indicate a concussion to me. It was almost certainly a nerve pathology (a nerve in the shoulder/neck region got pinched, and cut off sensory and motor signals from/to that side of the body), which is likely something that was known before this ever happened.  He didn't lose balance, he didn't look dizzy/out of it, but he had trouble controlling his left arm (locked in place), and maybe something with his left leg, after hitting someone with his shoulder.  Watch the first hit here. He is squared up with the guy, and gets hit right in the clavicle area, which is where the bracial plexus lies (bundle of nerves that run down the arm and parts of the trunk (traps/serratus anterior).  This one is a little weird, he falls really slowly, but the way I saw it, he's trying to put his arm out to lean on it, and there's just no strength in his arm, and doesn't look like he's got any control over it.  Watch the second hit Here.  Again, stays on his feet, his arm is locked in place, and doesn't really show any signs of a concussion, but it looks like his left, upper body went completely numb and he couldn't move it. At the end of the video you can see him trying to move his arm.  Again, not something that would indicate concussion to me.  What would indicate it was the stutter stepping away weirdly.  This one is definitely a stinger, but looks like there's something else going on.  But again, these are all things that are incredibly hard to see on the field, you have to rely on the spotter for things like that, and the spotters aren't always associated with the team, sometimes just local doctors that are associates with the team physician.  I'm not saying that he should have been checked for a concussion, because clearly he ended up with one, and i would check nearly every player who came off the sideline hurt after getting a blow to the head/neck even shoulder, but just personally, thats not the first thing I would suspect."
Chargers,37vbws,Time4fun22,1 point,Sun May 31 00:12:34 2015 UTC,"Holy crap people who try to defend that move piss me off.    First, its pretty obvious what I mean by training staff.  You're just being nit picky.  But if you really can't tell what I mean, then just take it as whoever is in charge of keeping players healthy, strength and conditioning coach, team doctor, I dont care.    Secondly, the Addae thing wasn't just the on field movements.  If you dont recall, the Chargers took him to the sidelines, EVALUATED HIM FOR A CONCUSSION, and then cleared him to play.  You're making it sound like they were only allowed to use that short on field video to determine if he had a concussion.  What are those links supposed to be proving?  That he wasn't concussed?  The Chargers admitted he was the day after that game.  Or maybe that it was difficult to determine that he was concussed?  If our doctor is with a player seconds after he gets concussed and decides that he wasn't, he sucks at his job.   And don't tell me that its hard to know if a player is concussed or not.  The NFL basically makes it so that if a player is at the slightest champ of being concussed, he isn't allowed back in the game.  You're going to try to tell me that there was ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to indicate that he was concussed, not just by that video, but when he was being examined personally on the sidelines?  And lets not forget how fantastically we handled the Kris Dielman concussion in 2011 which basically ended his career.    And the whole David Chao thing which was pretty much a disaster no matter how you put it.    Our medical team, training staff, strength and conditioning coach, whatever you wanna call it, have just been terrible."
Chargers,37vbws,Duffman5755,3,Sun May 31 00:44:40 2015 UTC,"If you think that there's no possibility that people with concussions don't show symptoms right away than you don't know anything about concussion evals.  There's no immediate test, and because of the acuteness of the injury, there's so many different symptoms someone can present with, not all are testable on the sidelines.  If you have a foolproof system to determine if someone has a concussion, then you my friend have a multi billion dollar product.  But yes, it is absolutely possible that he comes off, complaining about his arm being completely numb, and then the docs give him a quick eval for concussion symptoms, and he doesn't present with anything.  Concussions, depending on the area of the brain, severity, person among many, many other things can take seconds, or days to show symptoms.  I would like to add that the NFL also requires a non-team-associated doctor on the sideline, that has to clear anyone that presents with concussion symptoms.  The Dielman situation was a little bit different.  He got a concussion and didn't come off the field, when he did i believe they tested him and held him out for the rest of the game.  Again, its something that is very hard to see from the sidelines of games that one should be on the ref, but at that point in time, Refs didn't have the power to stop the game for someone that wasn't down and was just stumbling.  The seizure was not something that they could've controlled, and could've happened even if they pulled him right away, especially if his concussion was severe.  I don't commend them for this one, but I will say that it is not easy to spot concussions from the sideline unless the player stays down, you could probably see 2-3 plays a game where someone presents with concussion symptoms, and they aren't able to get them off the field in time.  I don't really remember when exactly in the 4th Qtr this play happened, and can't find a video of it, but I thought we pulled him after the series but I could be wrong."

BoltTalk is the longest running Chargers podcast and they take a decent amount of phone calls from fans.  San Diego Sports Junkies cover all of the San Diego teams from a fan perspective and also have listeners call in with their opinions.  The Chargers Power Hour is a daily one-man talk radio show.  And then there is one by the name of the Chargers Chat Podcast but those guys suck.  I gave them 5 stars on iTunes just to be ironic, you should do the same."
Chargers,37vsf8,ChargersChatPodcast,1 point,Sat May 30 22:02:14 2015 UTC,Scott and Br podcast is my favorite for entertainment. The Chargers pour hour podcast is good too. Bolts from the blue is best for just in depth chargers talk

Chargers,37vsf8,kondor35,1 point,Sun May 31 00:19:12 2015 UTC,Chargers Power Hour for pre and post game stuff.  Hardwick had his own show during The Loose Cannons show. Philip Rivers always calls into Darren Smiths show and gives a great interview.
Chargers,37vsf8,zeehrob,1 point,Sun May 31 06:08:07 2015 UTC,"I know you specifically mentioned podcasts, but a nice way to get some of this stuff: download the Mighty 1090 app, and iHeartRadio (for 1360 Fox Sports SD) if you don't have it. Also, in case you didn't know/realize, the Chargers app streams the audio calls from  Josh Lewin and Hank Bauer. Sometimes I turn the volume down on my TV and sync up the radio calls through a Bluetooth speaker. It's amazing."

Chargers,37w37z,BobTaco,18,Sat May 30 22:00:22 2015 UTC,i think Keenan Allen can become a #1. What exactly defines a #1 anyways?
Chargers,37w37z,adamzb,27,Sat May 30 22:41:53 2015 UTC,"What exactly defines a #1 anyways?   Bingo. I think even if we were to have that appointed/anointed #1, Philip spreads the ball around to everyone that I don't think that #1 WR would be that quintessential #1.  I like having a corps of WRs as opposed to the guy and options after him."
Chargers,37w37z,ace-destrier,25,Sat May 30 22:59:03 2015 UTC,"We were the 10th best offense in the NFL last year (per Football Outsiders' DVOA) with a terrible O-line, no running game, and Philip Rivers playing through injury late in the season.  With an improved O-line, the addition of Gordon, a healthy Woodhead, and Stevie Johnson, I have very little concern with our offense."
Chargers,37w37z,ChargersChatPodcast,3,Sat May 30 23:39:10 2015 UTC,"On one hand, I know the statistics were pretty solid for our offense last year, but there were several major games (like the Pats and Broncos games) where our defense did their jobs pretty much as well as we could have asked for and our offense simply did not capitalize against admittedly pretty adept defenses. While injuries certainly played their part in our late season collapse, it has become a pattern that we'll have a fluke game where we are dominant against a great defense (the Seahawks game last year) and we look like chickens with our heads cut off against other solid defenses we face off against throughout the season overall (Chiefs, Broncos, Pats, Dolphins (ugh), Cardinals) - literally all of our losses last year."
Chargers,37w37z,predalienmack,7,Sun May 31 21:11:22 2015 UTC,"I think as long as we move Allen to the slot, where he belongs, we have great balance. His little quickness/hands, Floyds leaping ability, Stevie Johnsons speed/deep threat ability, and Gate's.... Gatesness."
Chargers,37w37z,Bsul21,2,Sat May 30 23:20:18 2015 UTC,"I like Allen in the slot. I like Woodhead there, too."
Chargers,37w37z,sdsupersean,10,Mon Jun 1 23:03:58 2015 UTC,Antonio Gates has always filled that role.
Chargers,37w37z,ratpriest,2,Sat May 30 22:01:24 2015 UTC,"Eh, he's lost a step or two. Would be nice if we had a legit deep ball/big play threat. Jacoby Jones maybe? But he's up there in age too."
Chargers,37w37z,BobTaco,11,Sat May 30 22:03:41 2015 UTC,"IMO, #1 WR isn't about the deep balls, it's how much of a threat he is. Allen in Slot, or Johnson in Slot is scary. Floyd can always do what he's done for years and go deep."
Chargers,37w37z,BobTaco,1 point,Sat May 30 22:07:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah but Floyd is old as well, and our receivers couldn't get open against good secondaries last year."
Chargers,37w37z,kr0kodil,5,Sat May 30 22:08:57 2015 UTC,Because Rivers couldn't get protection and there was no run game. Can't do much when you only have 3 secs to throw a ball...and play action does nothing.
Chargers,37w37z,BobTaco,0,Sat May 30 23:41:20 2015 UTC,"No, our receivers couldn't beat man coverage. It was painfully apparent against teams with decent corners."
Chargers,37w37z,toethumbs8,3,Sun May 31 00:06:24 2015 UTC,"And given enough time, any receiver can get open. It's still more then just the WRs fault."
Chargers,37w37z,GummiBearMagician,5,Sun May 31 00:46:10 2015 UTC,Agreed. What about the Seattle game when we beat the best secondary in the league?
Chargers,37w37z,kr0kodil,1 point,Sun May 31 05:52:36 2015 UTC,"Just chiming in to add to the other poster. If there's one weakness in the Seattle secondary, it's the short routes up the middle with TEs and great route running slot receivers."
Chargers,37w37z,steve582,0,Tue Jun 2 16:37:58 2015 UTC,"Rivers and Gates played a perfect game that day. The receivers didn't do much at all.  Towards the end of the year, teams played tight press-man against us and we had no answer because our receivers couldn't shake single-coverage before the blitz got to Rivers. This year our line should be better, but we may still struggle sustaining drives if the receivers can't get separation quickly."

Chargers,37w37z,sdsupersean,7,Sun May 31 01:48:24 2015 UTC,I guess scoring 12 tds is losing a step for Antonio Gates.

Chargers,37w37z,highastronaut,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:16:56 2015 UTC,"Allen is a fine #1. It was the first year under a new coordinator, no line, no run game, and an injured rivers. He probably also faced the hardest cornerback schedule in the nfl as well. I expect him to return to a thousand yard season this year."
Chargers,37w37z,Duffman5755,1 point,Sun May 31 02:19:40 2015 UTC,"The patriots and seahawks, the two super bowl teams, along with several other good teams don't have number one receivers. it doesn't matter. we have a ton of weapons and will keep defenses guessing"
Chargers,37w37z,Duffman5755,0,Sun May 31 18:00:39 2015 UTC,"Yep, in fact were probably better off without one.  Look at the team's who have won the super bowl the last few years.  I've talked about this before and honestly, the closest thing you'll find to a true #1 is Marvin Harrison, and even he had Wayne and Manning who is the king of spreading the ball around.  You could consider Hakeem Nicks a true #1 but it's hard to say that Victor Cruz , who had a couple more hundred yards that season wasn't more of a target for Eli.  Simply put, it's easy to take away one target, but when you spread the ball around with a heavy dose of the running game, it's a much harder offense to stop.  If you have a true #1, it can make some things easier, but you have to have a 2 or even 3rd WR that can pick up the slack that the D taking the #1 away."
Chargers,37w37z,Jiac2001,1 point,Sat May 30 22:13:02 2015 UTC,Well we have Gordon and Woodhead is back so I feel a little better without a true #1. Some of our receivers need to step up this year though. I want to see more of Inman and what he can do. Maybe Stevie Johnson has a career resurgence with the help of Rivers? Keenan is moving back to the slot I heard.
Chargers,37w37z,Lighterless,1 point,Sat May 30 22:17:57 2015 UTC,"I don't really get the concept of trying to move Allen specifically to the slot like everyone talks about.  We've moved him around his entire career, thats where he's best, is not playing outside or inside specifically but using him to get matchups.  He's quicker than most bigger WR's and more physical than slot guys that tend to cover him.  He did well vs Sherman because of his quickness and rout running, while being big enough to handle the physicality of Sherman.  He didn't torch him or anything, but he took away the advantage of Sherman shutting down one side of the field.  Stevie Johnson is the same way.  He's really hard to cover because he runs routs so.....uhh....uniquely?(thats the only way i can put it. there is SO much wasted motion in his routs, but because of that, he's so damn hard to read for DB's.  Thats the same reason Kaep had trouble with him, I think Rivers will do better with getting the timing down with him).  This offense is going to have so much fun moving guys around getting the different matchups we want, Woodhead, Allen, Johnson, and even Floyd are all such different, but versatile players that people are going to have a lot of trouble trying to match up with us in the passing game.  Then you add in guys like Gates and LaDarius Green, who can be threats in their own right, as well as matchup nightmares, even though Gates has slowed down quite a bit.  If we can establish a running game, this is going to be a very, very good Offense."
Chargers,37w37z,TheFakeTomTelesco,0,Sat May 30 23:45:59 2015 UTC,"We're okay with it. But if Danario Alexander returns he'll likely be our ""#1 Wide Receiver"" imo."

Chargers,37wyod,weedb0ng,12,Sun May 31 07:47:34 2015 UTC,"It's less of ""losing his job"" and more of ""getting Troutman the fuck off the field"". As far as I'm concerned, you could switch Barksdale and Fluker there, it would still be a good line. It's a big enough improvement just to get Troutman off the field.  I just believe that Fluker, who's better at run blocking, at guard and Barksdale, who's better at pass blocking, at tackle is the best option."

Chargers,37sb6x,badbillsvc,2,Sat May 30 05:10:05 2015 UTC,Exactly. Weddle is a pro and has always conducted himself as. He's the exact opposite of a slacker or a selfish player. He's always personally taking blame when we lose.
Chargers,37sb6x,heyimrick,5,Sat May 30 08:15:50 2015 UTC,"We tend to forget that this is a business. And sometimes you have to business things. This was a thought out, calculated move by him and his agent and I respect that."

So I have absolutely ZERO problem with Weddle seeking long term security at age 30. Contracts are almost never fully guaranteed in the NFL, so I'm all for players milking every penny from the billionaire owners. Let's just be grateful that Weddle WANTS to stay with the Chargers."

Chargers,37sb6x,Lighterless,1 point,Sat May 30 14:44:26 2015 UTC,God I hate this newspaper
Chargers,37sb6x,steve582,1 point,Thu Jun 4 07:14:33 2015 UTC,I get holdouts but it is a highly unusual tactic when someone has a great deal already.  Holding out does not improve his chances of getting a new contract.  He has very little leverage.  It just smells of bad advice from his agent.  Maybe he is concerned of getting hurt during ota's but that is about the only benefit.  Honestly this move makes it seem like he won't be a charger for long because I don't think the chargers will sign him to a long term deal unless it was way less than what he is getting now.
Chargers,37sb6x,pick6and1,0,Sat May 30 02:47:46 2015 UTC,"I understand Weddle wanting to make a statement. OK, statement made.  Message received.  Now all he's doing is shooting himself in the foot (figuratively).   The article makes a good point about Corey Liuget. He's in the same boat as Weddle, and he's still at OTAs.  Their time will come, but I feel like the Chargers will deliberately offer Weddle just a little less than he wants, as punishment for pulling this stunt, and that would be a lose-lose situation, because right now, the Chargers need Weddle more than he needs the Chargers.  He's so good,  he'd easily get picked up by another team.   I really hope this doesn't end ugly for both sides but I don't see either side giving in, and that's sad.   TL; DR Weddle has made his point already, but the article also makes a good point about Liuget."
Chargers,37qzk2,MuaddibMcFly,7,Fri May 29 18:17:07 2015 UTC,I expect he's going to have to wait until Stuckey leaves the Chargers.
Chargers,37qzk2,crustycupcakes,8,Fri May 29 19:00:55 2015 UTC,I think by then he will have grown attached to #28.
Chargers,37qzk2,MuaddibMcFly,6,Fri May 29 20:36:51 2015 UTC,"Indeed. Here's hoping for long, impressive careers with the San Diego Chargers for both of them."
Chargers,37qzk2,ace-destrier,6,Fri May 29 23:46:47 2015 UTC,"Melvin Gordon, the top Chargers draft pick this year, acknowledged Tuesday he made a failed bid to get jersey number 25 from special teams captain Darrell Stuckey.  The rookie will continue to wear 28, the number he chose from options that didn't include 25.  And yet, the running back wouldn't concede total defeat.  ""Good dude,"" a smiling Gordon said of Stuckey, ""but I’m not going to give up.""  Stuckey, for his part, didn't smile when asked if he and Gordon discussed a number swap.  Nor did the outgoing Stuckey elaborate.  ""I'm 25,"" he said.  Gordon wore 25 in high school and throughout a Wisconsin career in which he gained 7.8 yards per carry. He called the move to 28 ""an adjustment"" but said he respects Stuckey for sticking with 25.  The running back isn't the first Heisman runner-up to wear 28 in San Diego. Twenty-eight was Marshall Faulk's number at San Diego State.  ""It is what it is,"" Gordon said. ""I’ve just got make something happen with 28."""
Chargers,37qzk2,Zack,12,Fri May 29 19:01:18 2015 UTC,"I think Gordon's mom kind of dissed Stuckey so I doubt he will give up his # to a rookie. He is a pro bowler, why should he give up his # to an unproven rookie? #28 isn't even a bad number, I like it more than 25 for a RB."
Chargers,37qzk2,KWASIKOSKI,4,Fri May 29 19:32:50 2015 UTC,How did his mom diss Stuckey?

Chargers,37mw0k,Smash_Things,10,Thu May 28 20:33:59 2015 UTC,"...wut?  Seriously though, Green has always flashed big play potential when they can figure out how to use him correctly. Reich obviously wasn't as comfortable calling his number last year for blocking or whatever reason he wasn't out there. So, of course I would love to see more of him.   But the logic that they would extend him based on ""him playing like we all think he will"" doesn't make very much sense. Everyone in the league has potential and has expectations of how they're going to play. But extending people based on, essentially, hopes and dreams seems like a poor contract choice right now."
Chargers,37mw0k,IlluminatedWorld,5,Thu May 28 20:47:41 2015 UTC,"It's not unheard of to lock up players long term under the expectation that they'll improve. We signed Weddle to a large contract when he was only a good safety and not the elite wonderbeard we know today. Steelers did the same thing with Antonio Brown, he was offered the same deal that Mike Wallace turned down, despite not having ""earned it."" Now the Steelers have one of the best wide receivers in the league at well under market value.  We can't always play the wait and see game. If Green blows up this season then he will probably get signed by another team willing to spend way too much, but if we can get him into an acceptable contract extension now, it has the potential to be a steal."
Chargers,37mw0k,rezyy013,2,Thu May 28 21:01:01 2015 UTC,thank you for writing it better than I did. I agree.
Chargers,37mw0k,BobTaco,2,Thu May 28 21:30:10 2015 UTC,"how about extending him based on the plays he did when he was there.  He didn't play enough in 2014 because a HOF is in front of him, and OC didn't use him. Remember that 2013 game vs the chiefs? Whistlehunt was better at calling plays with 2 TE sets.  If we let him play out, he'll be very expensive to resign, kinda what happen  to vincent jackson, in that we could see this guy was going to be great, even before 1000 yard seasons, and waited too long to extend his contract. Rivers even called him the fastest receiver he had. He is going to be good, he is good already, do we extend him now, at a discount, or later at full price?"

Chargers,37mqqn,BoltingUpSince91,12,Thu May 28 19:40:18 2015 UTC,"He's had it and he's a veteran.   he's actually a 2014 pro bowler. You don't get a pro bowlers number, by being a #1 round draft pick."
Chargers,37mqqn,surfingNerd,10,Thu May 28 20:09:28 2015 UTC,Confirmed. Darryl Stuckey is a pro bowl verteran who's been extended by the team because he's awesome at what he does and gives it all.  Gordon is an unproven rookie.  </discussion>
Chargers,37mqqn,Yooklid,-11,Thu May 28 21:43:20 2015 UTC,How about Gordon just grows up? It's a number. It doesn't make him. He can make 28 mean something just as good as 25.
Chargers,37mqqn,BobTaco,10,Thu May 28 20:02:05 2015 UTC,I don't think there's any evidence that Gordon is making a big deal about it...seems like he doesn't care much
Chargers,37mqqn,BoltingUpSince91,1 point,Thu May 28 20:26:00 2015 UTC,"Come on man, every football player wants ""their number"".  Its tradition.  Happens a lot"
Chargers,37mqqn,mikespimpin,1 point,Sat May 30 00:33:06 2015 UTC,I know sports has their superstitions...but I think needing your number from the past is a bit silly. Mind should be on the present...not the past. Especially as a rookie.
Chargers,37id3q,Big_Ugly_Cripple,11,Wed May 27 21:16:43 2015 UTC,"I am very excited about our O-Line. They're all great, with a questionable Center. If they work well together and perform they could immediately make Rivers, and our RB's look God-like."
Chargers,37id3q,Velocity17,6,Wed May 27 22:50:26 2015 UTC,Is Reyes really THAT bad?
Chargers,37id3q,Sprinklesss,11,Wed May 27 21:36:57 2015 UTC,He is more or less the Troutman of our defense.
Chargers,37id3q,Jiac2001,5,Wed May 27 21:48:00 2015 UTC,Except better because Reyes can pass-rush pretty ok. Troutman was just awful.
Chargers,37id3q,Jiac2001,1 point,Wed May 27 22:26:48 2015 UTC,Reyes can't even pass-rush ok. He's awful all around.
Chargers,37id3q,scrambles57,1 point,Sat May 30 10:38:09 2015 UTC,"Reyes in 2013 ranked -4.5 against the run but +8.1 in Pass Rush. The ratings were similar in 2012. He was having a down year in 2014 finishing with one sack. Which is why his PFF rating is really bad. But we can utilize Reyes as a pure situational player, who can rush the QB in certain packages."
Chargers,37id3q,historymajor44,1 point,Sat May 30 17:33:37 2015 UTC,Yes. He did nothing for our pass rush or run defense. Pretty sure he even had a -20 PPF rating to show for it.
Chargers,37id3q,predalienmack,5,Thu May 28 11:04:43 2015 UTC,Ingram and Attoachu need to step up but other than that we have a very solid team.  An awesome offensive line.
Chargers,37id3q,Smash_Things,1 point,Wed May 27 22:44:30 2015 UTC,"I think the Chiefs certainly have a lead in edge rushers, but in the overall linebacking corps? Definitely the Broncos. Miller, Trevathan, Marshall, need I say more? I think it's ludicrous to think otherwise with how well the Broncos' linebackers were last year."
Chargers,37id3q,Smash_Things,2,Fri May 29 04:15:07 2015 UTC,How did he forget demarcus ware and shane ray for the broncos... They may be pushing the CHiefs for that top edge rusher spot
Chargers,37id3q,boltsteve,7,Wed May 27 22:16:00 2015 UTC,I would still take Houston and Hali over those two but I totally agree that you can't have a discussion about edge rushers without even mentioning Ware and the potential of Ray.
Chargers,37k262,asdfqwerasdfqwerasdf,1 point,Thu May 28 04:55:40 2015 UTC,Looks like rivers is about to murder the ref in that thumbnail   Love it
Chargers,37h134,bdubbz14,3,Wed May 27 15:58:39 2015 UTC,"Not on the OL, the only one I could see it happening at is OLB or maybe DE (which is unlikely with the Unrein signing, and I have a feeling that we're going to see Ricardo Matthews play a bigger role this year, coaches speak really highly of him).  I don't really see anyone being brought in at OLB though, despite the injury concerns and not much depth.  But most areas of our team have a pretty solid vet presence somewhere."
Chargers,37h134,Duffman5755,3,Wed May 27 16:45:45 2015 UTC,Ricardo Matthews was the one with the bright yellow gloves that looked like flags all season right?
Chargers,37h134,Sprinklesss,4,Wed May 27 21:39:48 2015 UTC,No that was kavell Connor
Chargers,37h134,zeehrob,2,Wed May 27 22:23:02 2015 UTC,Ah damn thanks!
Chargers,37h134,Sprinklesss,4,Wed May 27 22:53:52 2015 UTC,"Your actually right, they both did...Conner was just more tmnoticeable since he played off the line"
Chargers,37h134,Duffman5755,1 point,Wed May 27 22:59:51 2015 UTC,Gotcha. Yeah I remember seeing them most on special teams for some reason
Chargers,37h134,Sprinklesss,2,Wed May 27 23:03:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Conner is on like every special teams group, and hes up there with the best STers on our team, so he was in on a ton of tackles.  I also think that he flails his arms around a ton, or is just really lanky or something, cuz I remember a lot of random movement with those bright yellow mits....lol"
Chargers,37h134,Duffman5755,1 point,Wed May 27 23:37:06 2015 UTC,"No he's actually right, I thought that too but they both did"
Chargers,37h134,Duffman5755,1 point,Wed May 27 22:58:56 2015 UTC,"I think your thinking of Kavell Conner, who's a ILB and STs guy.  I don't remember Matthews wearing those gloves but I could be wrong  EDIT: Just looked up his picture and it looks like he did wear those glvoes quite a bit"
Chargers,37h134,Duffman5755,1 point,Wed May 27 21:46:01 2015 UTC,What's our cap at? Might have to save some money to replace guys who get injured mid season
Chargers,37h134,BoltingUpSince91,1 point,Wed May 27 17:21:01 2015 UTC,"IIRC we have quite a bit of money left, probably upwards of 5-10 mil, so thats not an issue, but at this point, unless someone really worth it comes free, there's no reason not to just save it for next year."
Chargers,37h134,Duffman5755,1 point,Wed May 27 19:02:02 2015 UTC,"Probably not along the OL. It seems like the Chargers have their starting 5, and a swing tackle in Hairston and a backup C in Trevor Robinson. With those two they have the backup plan for LT, C, RG, RT for sure, and it's possible that Watt could move to LG if Franklin gets hurt. As for OLB, I think the Chargers are going to roll with what they have because it's difficult to find anyone at that spot in FA. What they really could use is a run defending OLB to play opposite of Ingram on early downs. But with over $11 mil in space, the Chargers could add a significant veteran contract and still have plenty of in season wiggle room."
Chargers,37h134,alightsoutbeast,1 point,Wed May 27 18:25:23 2015 UTC,Only go oline if Mathis ends up getting cut
Chargers,37h134,1CHIPPY32,0,Wed May 27 22:56:28 2015 UTC,"I love Freeny and the depth he provides outside, however with his age I hope he returns to Indy for a year or two and retires a Colt."
Chargers,37h134,803Tiger72,1 point,Thu May 28 03:27:57 2015 UTC,"I think he will sign a one-day contract and retire with them regardless. I wouldn't mind picking him up as a late-preseason or mid-season reinforcement for around the veteran minimum, if for nothing else than his leadership."
Chargers,37epbo,Ramseen,21,Wed May 27 02:09:36 2015 UTC,plz be nice 2 eachother
Chargers,37epbo,I_AM_METALUNA,-10,Wed May 27 02:21:16 2015 UTC,"Imo, the city has some slack to pick up."
Chargers,37epbo,MuaddibMcFly,8,Wed May 27 06:06:23 2015 UTC,"Yes, how dare a nearly bankrupt city be reluctant to fund a money-losing endeavor on behalf of a billionaire..."
Chargers,37epbo,EasilyAnnoyed,9,Thu May 28 00:19:53 2015 UTC,"The Chargers opted not to exercise their termination clause in the Qualcomm Stadium lease for 2015, but without a suitable plan for a new facility come the fall, there is a strong chance the team won't be in San Diego next season.    Well I suppose it's a good thing we have one then?"
Chargers,37epbo,Aduckonquack97,4,Wed May 27 03:49:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah this proves nothing. Just because their termination clause is up and we don't have a stadium RIGHT now, doesn't mean they won't stick it out at the Q for a few more seasons while the new Fútbol/Football stadium is being built."
Chargers,37epbo,energyfinancedude,3,Wed May 27 05:16:10 2015 UTC,This is good news
Chargers,37epbo,ilovefacebook,0,Wed May 27 04:06:39 2015 UTC,they Better come up with a better stadium design than the high school pencil drawing they released last week.
Chargers,37epbo,dan_buh,2,Wed May 27 05:17:49 2015 UTC,"I'll admit for over a billion dollars I was expecting a lot more. But there was nothing wrong with that stadium except the price. Maybe part of the back and forth can be a smaller stadium size to reduce cost, it seems like we don't sell out a lot and have had blackout problems in the past. Maybe Spanos puts up and extra 50 mill and make the stadium smaller to cover the other 50 mill."
Chargers,37epbo,SantiagoAndDunbar,-6,Wed May 27 11:44:57 2015 UTC,Yeah that looked like a cheap soccer stadium. Pathetic
Chargers,37epbo,fuckdirectv,3,Wed May 27 06:06:28 2015 UTC,"You understand that the actual design in that presentation is basically just a placeholder, right?  It is intended to enhance all the words and numbers in the proposal by giving a visual representation of a new stadium.  It does not represent a final design.  If the Chargers and the city are able to reach an agreement, then they will sit down with an architectural firm to begin the actual design of the stadium."
Chargers,37epbo,SantiagoAndDunbar,-2,Wed May 27 16:16:12 2015 UTC,Yeah no shit. Still doesnt mean its not a terrible design
Chargers,37epbo,fuckdirectv,2,Wed May 27 16:52:06 2015 UTC,"I'm not a huge fan either, but if they get to the point of actually designing and building it, I would bet it ends up looking a lot different than this rendering."
Chargers,37e8rj,IamMrT,42,Wed May 27 00:03:17 2015 UTC,"This is like if America and the Soviet Union were going to become one county, but it's ok because there won't be a statue of Stalin built on top of George Washington's grave."
Chargers,37e8rj,OrionRivers,9,Wed May 27 01:11:23 2015 UTC,They better not allow a Hitler tribute either...for the exact same reason.
Chargers,37e8rj,BobTaco,6,Wed May 27 01:21:42 2015 UTC,"Chances are, if they won't allow an Al tribute, AND the Chargers and Raiders share a stadium, they won't allow a Seau tribute either.  I don't know if anyone was serious about the Junior tribute, but if it goes one way, it should go the other."

Chargers,37dcni,MonteCristo92,13,Tue May 26 21:26:52 2015 UTC,"Great article. I think it's safe to say that no matter how this signing plays out, he's a good value pick-up and a definite upgrade to the line. No one can predict injuries so putting that aside for now, we have a great 5 up front and thinking about Fluker moving inside to guard where his strength will really shine is tantalizing already. Troutman was horrific, and seeing as how Barksdale is basically the ""Fluker"" of the Rams (weak help on the right side making him look worse than he is) I can only say that this signing and this analysis have me excited."
Chargers,37dcni,jtam35,4,Tue May 26 20:44:59 2015 UTC,"Whether or not Fluker moves to guard or not, it's going to be an interesting offseason competition on the right side of the line. This will only better prepare both players. Even if we get just a half second more protection for Rivers, that immediate impact for the bargain 1 yr contract is huge. And I wouldn't want to prepare against our power running attack on other side of the ball. I see this as nothing more than a nightmare for the rest of our division."

When I'm being rational, I can't even hate Archie for that cockup.  ..but the rest of the time, I revel in the fact that Eli has never beat the Chargers."
Chargers,37enjv,MuaddibMcFly,4,Wed May 27 21:25:55 2015 UTC,I actually dont mind Peyton. The fans are what make denver intolerable to me. Eli on the other hand irks me like no other player. I wish him nothing but failure.

Chargers,37ekok,SunriseSurprise,3,Wed May 27 18:20:56 2015 UTC,He's real life Ray Finkle basically (though in the movie he only got on the Dolphins mid-season).
Chargers,37eju3,Ern-Cockworthington,9,Wed May 27 01:26:45 2015 UTC,"As the OP, I suppose I should add my thoughts on the matter, shouldn't I?  At the time next season's schedule was released, I gave us the very generous prediction of 11-5 based on schedule alone. Instead of adding onto that record due to our increased firepower, I'll use this to support my previous prediction.   Vs. DET - Loss, mostly due to the fact I believe this matchup is anyone's game, and in order to sanctify my list, I'll put us at a loss on this matchup. @ CIN - Win, as we've shown we can beat the Bengals at Cincinnati, I'd put my money on us winning this battle. @ MIN - Win, since the cold won't get to us as badly as if it were later in the season. Vikings have had a history of putting up a fight against us, having us trade off wins every time we've faced them. We won our most recent bout, and I believe we'll break the trade cycle that we have going on by winning once again. @ CLE - Win, because lolbrowns. Kidding aside, even if we swept the rest of the AFC North, we'd be a laughing stock to them if we lost to the Browns. With that looming behind the team aside, I believe this will be an easy win. Vs PIT - Win, remarkably. It'll be a tough battle, but I have a feeling our homefield advantage will come into play on this bout, helping us win by probably one score alone. @ GB - Loss, sorry fellas. As much as I'd love to see Aaron Rodgers thrown to the dirt multiple times while Melvin Gordon flexes his muscles in the endzone for a remarkable 5th time in one game, I don't think it's going to happen; and sadly, I don't think it'll be close. Please prove me wrong! Vs OAK - Win, because as much as I boldly predicted that the Raiders won't finish last in our division, we're simply too powerful for them to overcome, especially coming off a 3-13 season with virtually little signs of improvement. But, as sad as it may sound, this game will indeed be close, as they always are.  @ BAL - Loss, because... Well, yeah. It was sweet victory last year when we swiped the rug from under their feet and won by a single point, but they're still an incredible team. I predict a loss, but who knows, maybe we'll win by a single return touchdown with help of a certain ex-Raven. Vs CHI - Win, because fuck Chicago. But, personal issues with the city aside, I believe this will be another quick and easy victory for us. Nothing more to say, really, so I'll just say fuck Chicago once more. Vs KC - Loss, because even with our O-line improved and the chances of tying the record they set sacking Rivers being at an all time lowfuckyoujustinhouston I can see us only splitting our wins against the Chiefs this year. Woops! I just spoiled my prediction for our second game against them, didn't I? @ JAX - Win, because, well... They're quite easy for us to beat, and their improvements to their team don't come close to the improvements we've made on our own team, sooo... If we lose, someone gets to spank me. Vs DEN - Loss, because... here we go. One of the games for us to prove that we're no longer the younger brothers of the division that can't compare to Peyton Manning's Broncos! That we'll be showing signs of winning our division! Aaaaaaand we blow it. Yeah, we tend to do that. But, I could tell you that this will not be a blow out, not by a long shot! @ KC - Win. Yeah, that's right. We take our revenge at Arrowhead and beat the absolute tar out of the Chiefs for knocking us out of playoff contention last season. This is only the beginning, my friends, as Philip Rivers goes Super Sayain and rallies our Chargers to a complete streak of pure, unadulterated VENGEANCE. Vs MIA - Win! Yes, win! Sadly, I don't believe we'll shut them out as they did to us last year in that game no one seems to remember, but once again Philip Rivers shows signs of becoming the league MVP as he leads our Chargers to destroying the men who humiliated us. Oh, sweet justice! @ OAK - Win, because Philip ""Felipe 'Santa Claus' Rios"" Rivers loves giving us gifts. We take out our revenge on the Raiders for... ummm... indirectly causing Verrett's injury! There we go!    Christmas comes early, we murder the Raiders, and we have one final opponent, our greatest rival in the common era...   @ DEN - Win! Yes, win! Not only did they take us out of the playoffs in the 2013 season only to move on and embarrass themselves in the Superbowl, they had also swept us in 2014. We have a decent record of winning in Denver, so this isn't an impossibility!   Thus concludes our 11-5 season! Rivers will earn the league MVP for one of the greatest seasons he's had as our quarterback! Maybe we'll make it to the AFC Championships to face our toughest opponents, the same team that stripped us of 2 potential superbowl rings... The New England Patriots."

Chargers,37eju3,Lighterless,4,Wed May 27 06:16:16 2015 UTC,"I like playing the broncos later in the year as I think if last year is a guide, peyton will be wearing out and won't be as effective."
Chargers,37eju3,steve582,2,Wed May 27 14:46:47 2015 UTC,So we'll split with the cheerios and sweep the broncos? Do you think the Chris will beat or the broncos for the wildcard?

Neither will the Chiefs :p  I actually see the Broncos taking second with the Chiefs coming in third. I see the Chiefs splitting with the Broncos and the Chargers and the Raiders to go 3-3 in the division, and then I don't see them doing quite enough in the regular season to overcome it.  I'm really thinking it will be the Denver Broncos as the 5th seed, and the Miami Dolphins as the 6 seed."

Chargers,37eju3,Bsul21,2,Wed May 27 01:39:29 2015 UTC,"We have an easier schedule, a more healthy team (I know you can't predict injuries, but I doubt we end up as injured as last year because we were pretty much the most injured team), and we fixed our oline and have a (hopefully) stud running back.   Even if our team was the same players as last year, our floor should be 9-7 just like last year. After the improvements and getting injured players back, I see us easily winning more games than we did last year."
Chargers,37eju3,Sprinklesss,2,Wed May 27 01:48:21 2015 UTC,"May be a bit biased, but here goes.  Week 1 vs. Detroit - Win. Detroit lost Suh and Fairley, though their defense is still solid, they'll have a tough time getting to Rivers. Detroit doesn't play as well on the road as they do at home.  Week 2 at Cincy - Loss - I do feel we have the better roster, but Cincy is known for playing well at home, especially early in the season.  Week 3 at Vikings - Win - A 50/50, but I can Rivers making one more play than Teddy.  Week 4 vs. Browns - Win - Cleveland improved, but they still have no QB.  Week 5 vs. Steelers - Win - Fuck the Steelers  Week 6 at Packers - Loss. Winning in Green Bay is incredibly difficult  Week 7 vs Raiders - Win - Fuck the Raiders  Week 8 at Ravens - Win - I plan on being at this game. Should be a very close one. But I think last years win proved that Phil can win in Baltimore  Week 9 vs Bears - Win. By week 9, Cutler will be in full blown ""IDGAF"" mode  Week 11 vs. Chiefs - Loss - We'll split this series, and win in eachothers houses  Week 12 at Jacksonville - Loss. There's always that one ""What the fuck?"" game. This one seems perfect for it.  Week 13 vs Broncos - Win. This is the year that we overtake them. Manning is aging, our offensive line is much better/able to handle the pass rush.  Week 14 at Chiefs - Win. Rivers loves to play at Arrowhead, and this time he hopefully won't have a destroyed back/decimated line.  Week 15 vs. Dolphins - Win. Revenge time.  Week 16 at Raiders - Win. Fuck the Raiders  Week 17 at Broncos - Win. Yep, I feel a sweep for us this year. Now is the time.  12-4 Record with a 5 game winning streak to end? Sure."

Its not like losing the weight alone is going to really prevent anything.  Unless he's using the training to completely change his movement patterns and different muscle imbalances that he has that can be a precursor to those knee/hip issues, it likely isn't going to do him any good, because most of these injuries (especially ACL) are completely random and there's no way you can help them other than potentially (and even this isn't proven to work, though there's some indication it can help) fixing muscle imbalances that an athlete has."
Chargers,37aard,Duffman5755,37,Tue May 26 08:09:45 2015 UTC,"Article if you don't want to go to UT San Diego  Melvin Ingram went to Miami this offseason.  Somebody new returned.  The new man swears off beef and pork and doesn't touch bread, potatoes or pasta. He guzzles water between a fish- and chicken-centered intake that involves fruit, vegetables and rice. For breakfast, he scarfs down egg whites. On some days, it's oatmeal.  His athletic trainer in Miami paired regimen with a revamped diet.  Asked the results, the new man cracks an old smile.  ""Voila,"" Ingram said.  The Chargers outside linebacker weighed 266 pounds last season. Ingram 2.0 is 20 pounds lighter, down to 246 with 8 percent body fat. The lighter and leaner version is gravitating toward a larger leadership role. He'll be on the field Tuesday for the start of organized team activities (OTAs).  Ingram can sense it.  He needed this.  The 26-year-old says he lost weight not because of external pressure from the Chargers or otherwise. He did it because it was something he wanted after missing 19 games the past two years, including seven in 2014 from a hip injury.  He is two years removed from a torn anterior cruciate ligament.  ""Being at 260 or 265, 266, wasn't working, really,"" Ingram said. ""I felt quick but I kept getting injured. You've got to nitpick at your own body, your own self, your own game. ... I felt like playing lighter would be a better thing for me. The lighter you are, the less stress it is on your body, the less stress it is on your knees, your hips, your joints or your ankles, your toes -- everything.""  So, he went to Miami.  He met with David Alexander, owner of DBC Fitness, and expressed desire to become bigger, faster and more powerful. It sounded simple; Alexander could do that. The trick was Ingram wanted to lose 20 pounds in the process.  Their work began.  They trained twice a day, a weightlifting session in the morning and a more cardio-, plyometric-based afternoon workout, often including boxing. The two-a-days were done six days a week, Sunday the established rest day.  But that wouldn't be enough.  To build Ingram's body, they had to break it down.  Alexander found him to be dehydrated and prescribed a gallon of water a day. His diet was all wrong, eating foods that were either too processed or containing too much flour. His digestive system was overworked; red meat was scrapped in favor of more easily digestible proteins.  Sleep was important, too.  At least eight hours a night.  Alexander likened Ingram's discipline to a robot. As body fat decreased, Ingram gained strength because his muscles were working more efficiently, he said.  ""As quick as two or three days, he noticed his energy levels go way up,"" Alexander said in a Monday phone interview. ""He became obsessed with the process.""  OTAs start Tuesday.  It's the first of 10 practices divided over three weeks, the first time this offseason the Chargers offense and defense can line up and practice against each other. It will be different with a couple veteran outside linebackers no longer on the team; Jarret Johnson retired this year, and Dwight Freeney is a free agent.  Those two are gone, but a new man looks here.  Tuesday is the first time he can explode into a backfield.  ""I feel it's going to be a whole different explosion, a whole different Melvin,"" Ingram said. ""I feel like that 260-Melvin is gone."""

Chargers,37aard,agryan12,-6,Tue May 26 19:49:17 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if this is exactly wanted though.  I mean, you usually want a Rush LB at at least 250, usually 255-265.  Sure you're going to get more explosive when he's 20 lbs down, but in the process you're going to lose a lot of power usually, and the physicality was a big part of Ingram's game.  I'm sure he can survive at a lighter weight, but I think Ideally, i'd like to have him halfway between where he is and was.  We'll see how he does though.  EDIT: But I also think that this is going to be a big part of the new defense.  We're moving towards a base defense like the Seahawks 4-3 ""Under"" defense.  With this alignment, whoever the SOLB is, is going to have more LB like responsibilities, and you want him to be smaller than the traditional SOLB in a 3-4.  You see they have Bruce Irvin in Seattle, and Dan Skuta in Jacksonville, who are both pass rusher types, but they're smaller at right about 250 or a little under."
Chargers,37aard,Duffman5755,11,Tue May 26 05:13:13 2015 UTC,"If he's been doing it right though, he will be just as strong but lighter and quicker on his feet.  The 20lbs would have been excess weight that was weighing him down.  The extra 20lbs of weight in his attacks isn't worth as much as being leaner and quicker and stronger."
Chargers,37aard,McBX,-12,Tue May 26 07:44:21 2015 UTC,"Uhh....i'm sorry but there's next to no way that an NFL athlete (that is built like him specifically, not huge linemen type) can lose 20 lbs of pure fat, its just not going to happen.  Probably some of what he lost was just water weight if he's cutting back on a lot of carbs, due to water held in glycogen stores, at the most that's probably 10lbs, probably more around 5 lbs. But the point is that there's an incredibly slim chance that he actually gained, or kept all of his lean body mass in this transition.  The weight loss will make it not as necessary, but when you're trying to stack up 330 lb linemen on a daily basis, it has a good chance of catching up to you at some point, especially if you still try to play like you have that added mass.  ""If he's doing it right"" is a bad statement because there really isn't a ""right"" way to do it, each body is so different in how it regulates the intake of food, and how it adapts that to muscle synthesis and fat burning.  I'd like to see what his body fat was before this, with all the talk of getting down to 8% to be honest, the body fat probably isn't that different, maybe a couple of percent.  I mean its hard to talk about what type of weight he lost, cuz even with a lot of readings, nobody knows what type of weight he's lost, but its not likely that he just lost 20 lbs of random excess weight (fat/water), and its likely that he lost at least some muscle in the process.  But its seriously near impossible that we will see him all of ""leaner and quicker and stronger"".  He talks about getting stronger in the article, but thats likely just neuromuscular gains (basically the nerves/body learning to function/recruit muscles to perform the task in the best way possible).  We'll see how it works out on the field though."
Chargers,37aard,Duffman5755,5,Tue May 26 08:02:37 2015 UTC,"It's definitely not impossible. Let's be serious, 90% of NFL players are on some type of steroid or PED. NFL players would literally be dead before the playoffs if they didn't use HGH to help their body recover. There's a steroid that helps you easily cut bodyfat without losing muscle and used with other steroids can easily help them gain muscle. I'm not gonna say the names of the steroids but I'm sure Ingram is probably ""eating CLEN and TRENing hard"".  I also doubt he is 8% bodyfat. Most bodybuilders don't walk around at 8% or lower year round because it's very hard to maintain and you dont have as much energy as you would at 12%+. Actually playing football at 8% would be hell and I'd say he's probably really around 12% realistically but I haven't seen a pic of him yet."
Chargers,37aard,ChargersAndBeer,0,Tue May 26 17:57:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I dont think its impossible, but I think its highly unlikely that that what he lost was 100% body fat.  And I disagree with the steroids part, but to each they're own, although I think there are definitely a decent number of users out there.  But I think people overestimate what NFL players go through.  Games are very difficult, but practices are much more lax than at any level, and its usually all mental prep stuff, partially because the games are so intense.  That's why in the NFL you rarely see practice injuries.  But most are able to find different ways to cope with the stress of super intense games once a week.  But I've always liked to give people the benefit of the doubt, so that's just my opinion, i'm sure the answer is somewhere in the middle ground between us.  Agreed with the body fat thing.  I don't doubt that he got down that low, but there's no way that is going to be a sustained thing.  But what I was saying is that for him to lose 20lbs of pure body fat, and be at 12% body fat, he would have to be about 20% body fat from the start, which I doubt is the case, that was my general argument.  Its not that he can't lose 20 lbs, is that I doubt he had enough body fat on him in the first place to realistically lose 20 lbs of body fat."
Chargers,37aard,froggy184,2,Wed May 27 19:14:46 2015 UTC,"Sorry, i believe you're wrong.  He's had 5 months, he most definitely could lose 20 pounds of fat+water weight. He was probably in the mid-teens of bodyfat% and now he's at 8%. He probably dropped the weight first and then added muscle while recomping his body for the last 1-2%. I would say he's stronger and down a lot of fat this year."
Chargers,37aard,ThomasSumter,-1,Tue May 26 16:47:56 2015 UTC,"Why has it taken this long for the guy to get serious about this?  I mean his entire job is taking care of his body.  If that was my job, and I had the resources he has, I'd have been in tip top condition from the beginning.  Glad he put in the work, but really, this should be expected of every NFL 1st round draft choice."

Besides, this gives his backups more reps with the starting team, which means they'll be better at their job when it's time for them to play in an actual game."

Chargers,378v2u,goodguybrian,3,Mon May 25 21:12:19 2015 UTC,"Honestly people keep putting this on Telesco like Weddle is offering to come play for free and he's rejecting it.  My guess is that Weddle is looking to capitalize on a year where S's got stupid amounts of money, where Searcy got 6m per and he's coming out and saying...if hes getting that much, then I want 8+, and he's going to sit out until he gets it.  I think he eventually gets resigned, but there's a process that has to be worked out, and he still has a year left on his deal.  Right now we're focusing on getting a deal done with Rivers, Weddle will come after that.  Also, who cares its OTA's, that means OPTIONAL (even though it's pretty much become mandatory for everyone who isn't upset with the team), people skip these for whatever ""family"" reasons they can come up with every year, and some people just skip them because they want a break.  This isn't going to hurt anyone if he sits it out..."

Chargers,378v2u,elmatador12,2,Mon May 25 21:59:18 2015 UTC,"No, it doesn't, he has already said he's going to skip it, because he wants to get resigned this year, because average at best S's have made crazy money this year (Searcy getting 6m/year and Gilly getting 5.5m/year), so he probably wants 8+ mil per year (despite him earning 7.5 this year as a base salary), as well as long term security.

Chargers,378v2u,pick6and1,3,Tue May 26 01:10:11 2015 UTC,"He's still under contract(which means he has to play) for another year(2015). He's also being paid for this last year of his contract to the tune of 10.1 million. All that said, yes, he is free to do what he wants but that still doesn't change the fact that the only reason he is not participating is because he doesn't have guaranteed money for the following year. That to me says unprofessional. You're getting paid for this year, come in, bust your butt and make them realize why you deserve the new big contract.   If I were one of those deciding this, it would be a factor in our negotiations. No question."
Chargers,378v2u,sounddude,3,Tue May 26 01:44:26 2015 UTC,"Yes but it is hard to hold not going to optional training against a guy.  If he tries to pull a vjax or gates and misses non-optional shit then it gets interesting.  He is also already being paid very very well.  It is unusual for a guy on a 4 year old contract to still be top 5 highest paid at his position.  Either he ends his ""holdout"" after optional stuff or this will probably be the last of weddle in San diego."

On one hand, yes, it's an optional/voluntary workout and he isn't contractually obligated. Absolutely. However on the other hand, being a part of the team means just that, being with the team. Even if that means you have to attend workouts with your teammates while your future contract sits in limbo. This is why I think it's unprofessional for him to be play this game. I think it show ultimate class and dedication to the team he cares about if he did the work even with his future in limbo. That's me though."

I think weddle is making a bad decision on bad advice from his agent but maybe it works out for him.  I get the logic his value will never be higher but you don't give stupid money to guys that are almost 35 unless they play qb

Look at Reed and Polamalu, they started drop off around 32 YO. Weddle is 30 (and will be 31 at the end of next season)and still most likely wants to be paid like one of the top safties in the league. Why invest a lot of money for a guy whose production might drop off soon? I would still love if they re-signed him and if he remained a Charger for the rest of his career, but I understand the hesitation from Telesco's side"
Chargers,378v2u,JankyJoker,1 point,Tue May 26 16:55:47 2015 UTC,"While I have no doubt that he will drop off, Weddle is more than just an amazing safety.

Why is it so important that this happens now for Weddle.  You have to wonder.  Look at the deals that S's got this year.  Searcy just got a 6m dollar contract, hell Marcus Gilchrist averaged 5.5m a year.  What's Weddle thinking when he sees this?  ""What the hell, I'm WAY better than these guys, time to cash in...""  Weddle doesn't want his last contract to be the big one he gets, If Searcy can get 6m, you gotta think Weddle is going to want over 8m a year, which was what he got on his last contract."

I assume the team is trying to fill the rest of the holes we need and get something done with Rivers before we can throw money his way.

Chargers,377xln,sounddude,2,Tue May 26 00:08:22 2015 UTC,Used it all last season. Can confirm it works great. Well worth $25.
Chargers,377xln,TheMilt,3,Tue May 26 16:19:26 2015 UTC,Has anyone else used this service? Seems too good to be true!
Chargers,377xln,GL2U,2,Tue May 26 00:41:46 2015 UTC,"I just signed up a few hours ago and watched last season's game vs. Seattle.  Site itself is a little sluggish, and I had to do something to my proxy settings to be able to watch (it says you only need to do it once, though), but the video itself worked great."
Chargers,377xln,Wil_Stormchaser,1 point,Tue May 26 02:22:17 2015 UTC,I signed up for $25 and it looks like it works fine. NFL Network and last seasons games work so so far so good.

Chargers,377xln,luv1138,3,Mon May 25 18:25:53 2015 UTC,Why are you hesitant about Sunday ticket? That shit will change your life. It's seriously worth it.
Chargers,377xln,BoltingUpSince91,4,Mon May 25 17:43:19 2015 UTC,Sunday Ticket is with DirectTV. I'm not sure how accessible that is through my apt complex.
Chargers,377xln,dan_buh,2,Mon May 25 18:20:11 2015 UTC,"Youcan purchase Sunday Ticket as a standalone service if you can't get it with your apartment. You can watch games via xbox/pc/phone... I have an htpc so i just play it on my TV via computer. Workslike a charm, unless its a blackout. Other route is vpn and get nfl gamepass or like above nfl2go works like a charm"
Chargers,377xln,Wil_Stormchaser,2,Tue May 26 09:32:04 2015 UTC,"Living in Utah and not owning a TV, I stream games online.  /r/nflstreams is a good source for those, they have a thread up several hours before a game for streams of that game.  If you like to make a party of it, you might have trouble getting a good quality picture for a TV, but since I watch games alone it works fine for me."

Double Wide is a Chargers bar in East Village. Been there once; gets kinda cramped.   PineBox Rock Shop in Brooklyn is my favorite bar for NFL Sundays. One giant projector and TONS of TVs. They also have 20+ beers on tap, which more often than not include Green Flash, Stone, Ballast, and even AleSmith brews. Fans from all 32 teams go here.   /r/nflstreams is where I go a few minutes before kick off if I'm at home and want to catch a game.  I also highly recommend considering buying NFL RedZone to watch games when the Bolts are playing."
Chargers,377xln,TheIrelevantRelevant,1 point,Mon May 25 20:37:36 2015 UTC,"If you dont have Direct TV (or cannot due to housing arrangement ), they offer streaming of all the out of market games to your mutliple mobile devices or laptop for $199. Their viewing platform on laptop/tablet has the option to split the screen and watch 4 games at once, which is great (esp for ffb). There is no redzone  channel available at that price though (that cost another 100, so i  pass on that and just stream redzone on vipbox or something). They also have a $99 option but its only one game streamed to your phone only(i think).   I really like watching a game on by tv, 4 on the laptop with redzone and/or my stattrackers on the other half my screen. Plus being able to have a high quality stream of a game to my phone, in case I have to be somehwere on a football sunday, is awesome."

May I ask who I am speaking with?""  Been a DTV tech support agent for over a year now, I havent heard shit about this. So far the only people who can get a ""stand alone"" streaming account are people like me, a DTV employee with an asshole of a landlord."

I have also looked EVERYWHERE on the internet, Directv.com and at work. the only thing I found was an article from last September on NFL.com saying that MDU (Multi Dwelling Unit) accounts could get it this upcoming season.

Chargers,377xln,TheIrelevantRelevant,1 point,Tue May 26 07:37:33 2015 UTC,"What are you talking about? Ive used this service for the past two seasons. Its the same Nfl sunday ticket that was offered when you bought Madden 25 2 years ago. Last season I bought the package for 199.   Theres a sunday ticket app in the play store, ffs, which is used to stream the games if you purchased NFL sunday ticket. Or just click on the link in the article. It takes you the login page, which I was able to log into using my account information.   You should probly do your job better..."
Chargers,377xln,JackAssKidd,0,Tue May 26 08:01:34 2015 UTC,"show me where they say you can do a STAND ALONE subscription. yes you can get online and on mobile devices if you have the subscription NFLST MAX with your DTV services, but their is no where that says you can have sunday ticket with Directv unless you have cable services with DTV. You haven't actually proven me wrong yet. A downvote and telling me I suck at my job does not mean you're right."
Chargers,377xln,TheIrelevantRelevant,2,Tue May 26 16:50:14 2015 UTC,"Just so I am getting this straight. Are you claiming in 2013 Madden 25 did not give away a year subscription to Sunday Nfl Ticket, which could be viewed as a stand ablone subscription? Are you also saying that exact same service that millions of people used (or are lying about i guess)from Madden in 2013 did not exist again last season in 2014. You are claiming that no non directtv subscribers spent 199 and purchased SundayNFLTicket.tv to watch all the non market games? You are claiming there is no app in the play store that allows non DirectTV customers who purchased SundsayNFLTicket to watch the games. If these are what you are saying, then yes you suck ass at your job, because all those things are true,  but you know more than millons of people and  Is this some weird phishing scam trying to get my login info?

It's about $90 bucks for the season from what I understand. Once the stream starts, you can hop off the VPN.  The set up I saw was incredible.

I started talking about McNeil, Hardwick (I was a lineman if you couldn't tell), and a couple others.

Chargers,374gbq,Snuffaluffakuss,16,Sun May 24 20:03:01 2015 UTC,"Marlon McCree was still on the Chargers for the 2007 season and actually made a huge play in the AFC Divisional game against Indy. Knocked the ball away from Reggie Wayne on a crucial 3rd down play late in the 4th quarter. He was released after that season because the coaches wanted more play time for Weddle, who was a rookie that year.  He bounced around a few more times. Played a year in Denver and after that tired to go back to Jacksonville (one of his teams pre-SD) but didn't make it through preseason, which was the end of his NFL career. Note that he was a 7th-rounder who played for Jacksonville, Houston and Carolina before coming to SD.  I remember crying at the end of that game, but I don't hate Marlon McCree for what happened. A lot of things went wrong in that game and it's pretty unfair to me to put a loss on one individual moment, play, coach or player. Being a high school and collegiate athlete taught me that much."

Chargers,370tos,ChargersLT21,9,Sat May 23 22:11:40 2015 UTC,"I used a site called aliexpress.com, which I saw here. It's a Chinese site that sells some pretty decent knock offs. I bought a legit rookie Mathews jersey and since that fail just buy cheap ones now. They look great. Ive purchased close to 10 diff ones now, mostly for other people and a few for myself. Everyone loves them and they're like ~$25 USD. My only complaint is that they dont have Lorenzo Neal. :*("

Chargers,375r7x,weedb0ng,17,Mon May 25 02:54:03 2015 UTC,"No, Floyd is the best deep threat we have and has shown no sign of slowing down why take him out of the starting lineup when he is still productive?"
Chargers,375r7x,Lighterless,6,Mon May 25 03:02:05 2015 UTC,Its a pretty huge stretch at this point to have Inman that high. He only has 12 catches in his entire career.  I think Allen is the one with something to prove this season. Floyd is the #2 so that battle IMO will be between stevie and Allen for the #1 or the slot. Also don't forget Jacoby Jones is in the mix too. That's a lot of guys ahead of Inman. I don't think he sees the field much this year unless there's injuries or he tears it up in preseason.
Chargers,375r7x,Duffman5755,3,Mon May 25 03:18:01 2015 UTC,"This Inman hype is getting out of control.  I like the guy as much as anyone does, but he's not close to better Floyd from what we have right now.  Floyd lead our team in receiving last year with ~800 yards, and all the sudden he's below the guy we picked up from the CFL last year???? Are you serious....?  The guy's got potential, but I don't see him being much more than a solid #2 type as his ceiling (and he's a passing down sub right now as he should be, who you want going vs 3rd/4th CB's or S's), which is completely fine, since we have a team full of low end #1 to mid level #2 receivers, and honestly thats the type of passing game that has worked the best for teams in recent history.  The last guy who is a true #1 that won the super bowl is Marvin Harrison, and even then they had Wayne who's real good in his own right, who was essentially another #1, and even then they had Peyton who is the king of spreading the ball around to no name receivers.  The important thing is that we have 5 guys who are competent, and 3 or 4 guys who can beat you at any given time with Rivers at the helm.  Something Rivers does as good as anyone is not target receivers, thats the reason we all know and love Ajirotutu and Inman so much, is because Phil found them when the attention went to our bigger targets and they made a play on the ball."
Chargers,375r7x,basedcharger,1 point,Mon May 25 03:37:23 2015 UTC,kind of off topic but I would argue that the last true number 1 receiver to win the superbowl is actually Hakeem nicks he was great before his injuries took away his athleticism really a receiver who could do it all.
Chargers,375r7x,Duffman5755,1 point,Mon May 25 04:52:49 2015 UTC,"I guess, but he didn't even lead his team in receiving in '11, and had about 400 more yards on the season than Nicks.  I guess he could be considered a true #1, but I wouldn't consider him head and shoulders above the rest of the guys on the team.  I could absolutely see why you considered him the last #1 though.  But the point still stands that you very rarely see a passing game that is really built around one guy in the super bowl, its just too easy to game plan around one person, and make the others beat you."

Chargers,375r7x,pick6and1,2,Mon May 25 03:57:04 2015 UTC,I think he will make the 53.

Chargers,375r7x,pick6and1,2,Mon May 25 06:16:23 2015 UTC,"Disagree with both of these things. Floyd is our best deep threat, but I think Allen has more overall talent at WR. Inman made the 53 man last year, and he's only gonna get better."

Chargers,375r7x,luv1138,1 point,Mon May 25 22:11:28 2015 UTC,Well ww have Allen Floyd jones stevie all locks so that leaves most likely 1 spot up for grabs.  Whoever wins it will have earned it but I think it goes to the best special teamer
Chargers,371nis,codeByNumber,6,Sun May 24 00:55:01 2015 UTC,I was always under the impression that the NFL was exempt from anti-trust laws.  Even with that hat lawsuit a few years back the NFL was declared a cartel and not a single entity.  I want to believe but I think the Chargers can do this.
Chargers,371nis,diabloblanco,2,Sun May 24 03:20:57 2015 UTC,You're right in that they are not a Si fake economic entity it but that actually hurts them for anti trust purposes. Look up the american needle case for some info on it.

Chargers,371nis,ace-destrier,3,Sun May 24 03:50:01 2015 UTC,So what are the Chargers supposed to do? They have wanted a new stadium since the freaking 90s. Acting like the Chargers are holding the city hostage right now is a joke. One could say the city has held the team hostage for a long time now.
Chargers,371nis,Musingmike,5,Mon May 25 04:03:35 2015 UTC,"I want a stadium as bad as anyone. But in the city's defense, it's really not a winning fiscal decision. I know all the talk about hosting Super Bowls and college bowl games and events etc etc makes it sound like the local government is going to make bank off of this, but research shows that that's just not the case. This is all to say: if the Chargers wanted a new stadium for so long, it's their investment, and they should be the ones to make it themselves. Having said that, I like any idea that gets a stadium in San Diego because I love the Chargers. But to say the Chargers organization has been held hostage by being forced to stay in a bad stadium isn't really fair. As far as I'm concerned, legally, if they are down to fund a stadium 100% on their own, they can go wherever they want. But to coerce a city into spending money is wrong."
Chargers,371nis,broskiumenyiora,1 point,Mon May 25 16:27:51 2015 UTC,"They actually can't fund their own stadium. Spanos is one of the poorest owners in the league. If he were to try and fund a new stadium he wouldn't be able to afford payroll. The only way he gets a new stadium is if he, the league and the city all pitch in. Now we just have to hope that they all do."

The Chargers have been able to up and move at any point for  the past several years now, but they chose not to.  And why did they have the freedom to do that?  They bought the right to leave with the end of the Ticket Guarantee that was a bad deal for the City to start.  So please, tell me again how the City is holding hostage a tenant that they paid something like $500k a year to stay?"

I would recommend you check out the gaslamp district if you are into bars/clubs, I personally like the Indigo Grill in Little Italy and it has some very unique food.  Also I would recommend checking out La Jolla- especially the cliffs- also it is a decent place to learn to surf if you are interested in that.   Balboa park is a great place to visit- a number of museums and some nice architecture- the museums are probably pretty limited compared to the best of denmark (and limited compared to the best of LA) but it makes for a nice day out. My buddy recently proposed there so you may see alot of that.  If big ships is your thing- there are some aircraft carriers and destroyers docked there in the harbor."

The Air & Space Museum is pretty awesome and has some stuff from the wright brothers, the apollo missions, an SR 71 blackbird. ALso the Timken Museum of Art is free (or you can donate) and it is a nice small museum with interesting decor.  My personal favorite is the Botanical Gardens, some of the fine art museums are really good (almost all of them charge an entrance fee)  The main thoroughfare has quite a few performers (who are quite good sometimes), towering architecture, huge trees, food (mostly mediocre and overpriced IMO- I would bring food from INNOUT or a mexican food place and do a picnic)  There is too much in Balboa park to describe in one paragraph- I have gone there so many times and I still have not been to every museum, hiked every trail or seen everything that is there.  here is the tripadvisor http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60750-d102782-Reviews-Balboa_Park-San_Diego_California.html  Wiki (history of the park) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balboa_Park_(San_Diego)  official site  http://www.balboapark.org/"

I am just more concerned about my four year old son being around violent drunken behavior where there is a brawl or something.  I am excited to take my son that his first nfl football game.

And while much of this is due to his peerless skill set and unwavering warmth — it was loyalty that made him immortal.  When his equals were making upwards of $6 million annually in the early 1990s, Gwynn signed an extension worth $4 million a year so that he could remain a Padre. That day, his value skyrocketed in a way that Forbes could never measure.    BOOM. Nailed it."

It was officially ruled as a forward fumble that was recovered by Raiders tight end Dave Casper in the end zone for a touchdown, ultimately giving Oakland the 21–20 win. However, there have been differing interpretations of how this play should have actually been ruled, and it has remained a controversial play for fans of both teams involved. The NFL amended its rules after the 1978 season in order to prevent a recurrence of the play.

Chargers,36unks,Duffman5755,1 point,Sat May 23 03:25:00 2015 UTC,"It's not from trading players. It's basically to help teams that ""lose"" in free agency. The second link shows how it compares free agents lost and gained by a team. Theoretically, a team that loses a lot of players in free agency and doesn't add that many, will be a bit more disadvantaged. So a compensatory pick is just that, to help compensate for a net loss in free agency.   I used lose in quotations because there are some teams, like the Ravens, that regularly let players walk in free agency without signing many others, but still do fairly well on a regular basis. They can do this because they tend to already have players ready to take over."

Obviously completely different story with Weddle - more playing chicken with his desire to remain here vs. go elsewhere and MAYBE get as much or more than he wants, potentially be with a shitty team to do it and simply not be at happy, or sheepishly give in and take the San Diego discount to play here and continue to be in a relatively good situation where he's been able to shine. It'd be dangerous if that's what they were doing, but they've not made a wrong move doing that sort of thing so far, so we'll see."
Chargers,36ty30,heyimrick,2,Fri May 22 09:45:50 2015 UTC,That's a bad comparison.
Chargers,36ty30,blzd4dyz,3,Fri May 22 11:02:10 2015 UTC,Perhaps more beef on the O-Line and MG3 behind him makes Rivers a little more happy to stay.
Chargers,36ty30,penlies,3,Fri May 22 03:42:59 2015 UTC,Rather they be optimistic about staying in san Diego.

Chargers,36s2hd,marvinhward84,14,Thu May 21 17:49:29 2015 UTC,Love this article. Dude's so underrated and humble. He's got to be my top 3 favorite Charger on the roster now...
Chargers,36s2hd,JustaChokingV,6,Thu May 21 19:13:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks man!  And yes, very good all around person and player."
Chargers,36s2hd,AiDC,2,Thu May 21 19:20:56 2015 UTC,"He's always one of the last guys out there at the open practices, signing stuff for fans and posing for pictures. Such a cool dude."
Chargers,36s2hd,SantiagoAndDunbar,7,Fri May 22 00:30:50 2015 UTC,**MALCOM  some of the best hands in the league. makes the most ridiculous catches consistently. also an unbelievably humble and nice dude whenever i got to see him
Chargers,36s2hd,Dagger0941,3,Thu May 21 22:24:08 2015 UTC,I'm happy to where his jersey every time they play. Pretty cool to see those stats. Wish more people knew about him. It's kind of nice having a talented guy be so hidden though
Chargers,36s2hd,thejammar,1 point,Thu May 21 20:40:41 2015 UTC,"Floyd is so underrated, love watching him play."
Chargers,36sin7,abstrakt11,8,Thu May 21 19:42:12 2015 UTC,Nice find. I'm really excited to see this him play behind our newly improved O-line. Those quick cuts to make the defense miss in small spaces remind me of the L.T. days.

Chargers,36sin7,greencrack,2,Fri May 22 03:54:22 2015 UTC,"What is going to be fun to watch is we have one of the best outside RB's in the league now. Matthews could not hack it laterally, he was too slow, hence his 37 yard career long. Cant wait for him and Oliver to dominate and Woodhead making it look easy in the pass game."
Chargers,36sin7,weedb0ng,8,Thu May 21 19:58:35 2015 UTC,Mathews is plenty fast. He just has zero vision or open-field moves.
Chargers,36sin7,kr0kodil,2,Thu May 21 23:18:30 2015 UTC,"He had good vision too, he just had absolutely no moves besides run over or stiff arm."
Chargers,36sin7,mannym3,1 point,Fri May 22 03:01:55 2015 UTC,True that. At least last season he sure as hell didn't.
Chargers,36sin7,trillinair,1 point,Fri May 22 05:58:38 2015 UTC,Mathews actually had really good vision it was one of his better traits but  I agree no open-field moves to speak of.
Chargers,36sin7,basedcharger,10,Fri May 22 04:53:09 2015 UTC,"Mathews' 40 at the combine: 4.45  Gordon's 40 at the combine: 4.52  Mathews was never slow, he just was never healthy."

Chargers,36sin7,pistolpete4407,1 point,Thu May 21 21:03:22 2015 UTC,"What does a 40 time in shorts have anything to do with what I said? Watch tape on both of them. Gordon is faster,stronger, does not lose speed when he changes direction, quicker and his outside speed is unmatched turning the corner. Which Matthews could not do at all."
Chargers,36sin7,weedb0ng,0,Thu May 21 22:12:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, 40 times can often be skewed by some players not being very good at them, Matthews times faster than he plays (even though he is still very fast) and Gordon plays faster than he times."
Chargers,36sin7,ChargersLT21,0,Thu May 21 22:37:56 2015 UTC,"For me watching Mathews come from college to the NFL was when i realized just how much faster everyone on the field is. No more break away runs in the NFL, gettin caught from behind by DB's... Doods are fkn quick !!"

Chargers,36u1h8,penlies,2,Fri May 22 03:00:56 2015 UTC,Go sprinkle some chicken bones on the site and then come forward and say it is a Native American burial ground.  I also have some asbestos and some lead lined paint hanging out in my car.
Chargers,36u1h8,GreatestDenier,4,Fri May 22 15:21:16 2015 UTC,"One can dream, can't they?   Wishing for the deaths of thousands, maybe millions of people is never classy. Especially over a football team they don't seem to even want.   Also there are no faults capable of producing that big of an earthquake in Southern California. Even if there were, a 9.8 earthquake in the Los Angeles area would also devastate San Diego."
