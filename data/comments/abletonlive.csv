abletonlive,3e2q73,Assorted_Bits,5,Tue Jul 21 19:55:44 2015 UTC,"The biggest difference between a drummer and software is that software is capable to being precisely on the beat at all times with a constant velicity, while humans tend to be 'around' the beat with similar velocities. Even the most tight drummers do this, since we're dealing with physics which the software doesn't have to account for.  But we're talking about milli-seconds here in regards to timing, so it's hardly noticable, unless we're talking about Lars Ulrich."

First things first is youre going to want to make sure your samples are right. That song sounds like two main snare components, a sticked snare roll with lower volume, and a brushed snare hit a bit louder.   Then the important stuff-- midi programming. Look up online to see how people do flams and rolls in ableton, there are a good number of videos that should help."

Map the same snare drum on two different keys on your keyboard, and then drum with two fingers. Preferably you have a midi piano keyboard so you can get the nuances of velocity in there.   It's going to sound good, but it's not going to look good on midi. Quantizing the whole thing will end up really bad sounding too."

(doesn't work on 64bit)  It lets you send Midi from one application to another.  Usually you would use it in combination with programs like Midi-OX to process incoming or outgoing Midi signals.  edit- erm I misread all the things but I'll still leave this explanation here

abletonlive,3dfv7a,Tinkerbang,7,Wed Jul 15 23:08:50 2015 UTC,"To be honest I think you're overcomplicating this a bit. Anything that isn't live can be bounced to audio, saving CPU cycles. On the live tracks, simplify the FX chains and go with lighter ones. On stage nobody will know what compressor VST you used.  One thing I would recommend is an audio interface with as many outputs as possible, to give the sound guy some control. Group drums, synths, guitars and vocals and you could scrape by with 4."
abletonlive,3dfv7a,lunarlon,2,Thu Jul 16 00:12:06 2015 UTC,"I wondered if the sound guy would be ok with L/R or would want multiple outputs – good advice.  As far as bouncing to audio, the drums are the only thing that wouldn't be played live, even with 3 people. Most of the time there are multiple synths controlled from one keyboard, and then again with another keyboard. So with that, we have a lot that can't be frozen or bounced, and thus my concern.  But yes. Compressors and EQs are probably not needed for a live set like this and that would save some CPU."
abletonlive,3dfv7a,Lehster,5,Thu Jul 16 01:09:55 2015 UTC,exactly the reason i started collecting hardware synths/samplers.
abletonlive,3dfv7a,felldestroyed,3,Thu Jul 16 05:39:03 2015 UTC,"Computer guy who does music here.

I do run outboard effects for things that typically strain a computer - say, heavy delay - on rackmount units but by and large, everything else is soft synths/drum triggers/guitar and bass effects. I also use ableton as a ""fake"" crossover for a subwoofer and use 3/4 outs (this may not actually apply to you, as a firewire box may not need the extra clock cycles like USB uses).  Oh, and there's about 5 midi devices (push/3 keys/drum triggers) plugged in all at once. Point is: you can get by with less. I may even encourage you to use an AMD product, as they are traditionally cheaper."

abletonlive,3dcxxl,MCRoadkill,3,Wed Jul 15 08:04:55 2015 UTC,"The APC is definitely more suited to launching clips as opposed to finger drumming. With that being said, the pads on both are fairly small so you may have to get use to that. I have an older APC40 and it's great for launching clips and jamming around with live sets, but they've since come out with dedicated fader/encoder controllers like the Akai Midi Mix which make it a lot easier to mix and match gear. If I were to do it again today, I would definitely take the launchpad and midi mix over the APC. The launchpad has a lot more pads and is better for finger drumming and launches clips just fine, and the midi mix solves your problems of needing encoders and faders. I'm not sure what the automatic mappings in ableton are like for the launchpad and midi mix but I doubt you'll be losing out on much compared to the APC"
abletonlive,3dcxxl,Ni4Ni,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:28:22 2015 UTC,"Thank you for you feedback!  Yeah they all have full Ableton support, so that's not going to be a problem. (I hope)  for finger drumming on a drum rack I already have the Akai MPK mini.  But is the APC mini decent enough for fast paced clip launching/dub steb etc?  The APC mini has the same number of pads as the Launchpad 8x8 (64). and it has a better/sturdier usb connection, instead of the micro usb of the launchpad, but that's a minor thing since i use it for studio."

abletonlive,3db2ry,analoc,3,Wed Jul 15 07:45:13 2015 UTC,"As with any instrument or complex piece of equipment goes, playing with it is important.  What really helped me out was setting up a starting template with 4 - 5 midi tracks, a couple of return tracks with some basic fx, and a master fx rack with some wacky tricks.  From there, start slowly building a basic 1-scene multi-track loop.  Once built, start muting or stopping certain tracks, using mutes and solos, and occasionally messing with fx for interest.    Once you get the hang of that basic stuff, I'd recommend using the duplicate button, and then recording automation paths with the device parameter to create variance within each individual track.  Also, be sure to take advantage of holding certain buttons in combination with other buttons such as delete+automation on certain tracks or mute+individual drum pads in your drum track.  There's a lot of nuanced actions you can take advantage of with the push.   Finally, once you feel comfortable with that stuff, hit the master record button on the transport control of live.  Then you can start launching and stopping individual clips which then get automatically recorded into the timeline view while you play.  While the transport record is running, live will also record all fx and send automation across the recorded timeline, and you will quickly build a viable sketch for a song.    After you've done all of that, you should have a pretty good basic handle of how to take advantage of the push."

abletonlive,3db2ry,DJAndrewCharles,3,Wed Jul 15 05:51:31 2015 UTC,"One thing I can recommend is to open up an 808 drum rack, put your repeat on 1/4 note and hold down the kick.  Turn the swing up to 5, 10, and 15% or higher if you want to get crazy.  Hear how it changes? Play with it at different tempos and 1/8th, 16th notes etc.  when you get to the right combo, hit record for about 8 bars.  Now with the same parameters, go down a measure on the repeat and hold down a snare (if you're on 1/4 notes, just do 1/4 notes and manually erase the first, third, fifth, seventh notes). There's a beat! And it's swinging in time! Now do the same a quarter up on the repeat for your hi hats.  Now you can double these 8 bars and you've got a full section.  Now you can double tap on the 4th button of each row and add in some fills for each change. Now try dragging a sample into your drum rack with some atmospheric or melodic elements and repeat what you just did.  What I normally do after this is duplicate the entire track for as many sounds as I used and I separate each sound so there is only one per track, you can erase everything really quickly in the piano roll by selecting every note, then hold shift and click the piano key of the note you want to keep and press delete.  Name them, color them, order them Kick Snare Hihat Samples.  Now you have full control over the beat you just made.  You can start adding in effects and eq's to really make the sounds your own.  from here the possibilities are limitless.  Try using the repeat on some different instruments and keep it in time or maybe take the swing down a percentage or two to give it some feels based on the instrument.  Do your best to keep your hands on the push and your eyes off the screen and you'll be doing great in a couple months.  Practice an hour everyday.  Don't give up."

abletonlive,3d914w,zentothetenth,14,Tue Jul 14 13:17:40 2015 UTC,"Push scale mode (or any controller that plays in scale mode) isn't meant to be a substitute for knowledge of music theory, it's meant to be a substitute for having to invest time learning to play keys.  I am a traditionally trained percussionist, and the isophonic instruments we learn are the same layout as a piano/keys but the way they're played are different.  Therefore, I never really adjusted to a piano but I had knowledge of the relationship between major and the three minor scales in Western music, fifths, chord and interval theory.  All music is written in a key; Push confining you to a key shouldn't be limiting if you understand the structure of music.  I'm not trying to be insulting saying that, but I could probably go pick any piece of music that isn't jazz (some genres play a lot outside the traditional heptatonic scales, though Push can play pentatonic, septa-tonic and any other scale you want it to using the Scale MIDI effect or a M4L device) and compose it on the Push.  That said, yes, the Push doesn't have a lot more than any 64 pad controller like a Launchpad.  I got mine for free as I got a deal on it bundled with Suite 9 for less than $800, but I may have just got with a Launchpad, especially with the new RGB Mk2.   Still, the integration with Live is really tight and there are some interesting M4L devices out there for it."
abletonlive,3d914w,DogPoopBags,2,Tue Jul 14 14:34:37 2015 UTC,"You sir, have dropped some rare knowledge upon my eyes. what should I look up to learn more about the relationship of scale and song structure? I've never looked into it."
abletonlive,3d914w,DogPoopBags,8,Tue Jul 14 14:58:10 2015 UTC,"I was lucky to be forced into some classic training, though I don't have a ""complete"" understanding.  First learn interval theory.  It is the building block for all western music theory - from that you can learn both scale and chord structure.  A quick tip, 95% of music I've encountered as a professional DJ, everything from billboard hiphop to most festival big room house, trap, bounce, through more ""underground"" sounds like jungle, IDM, and the like, are written in a minor key.  Anyway, from chord and scale theory you can learn chord progression which is fairly intuitive once you understand chord and scale structure.  The hardest part, IMO, is listening to a song and picking out the elements and saying to yourself, ""Oh, this is a I-V6/3-IV chord pattern that is the primary sound of the song.""  You have to train you ear to hear the relative pitch but if you have a keyboard or MIDI controller with some sort of instrument running, you can often figure it out even if you don't have relative or perfect pitch (I don't, have been training my ear for relative pitch for a while, still not proficient).  Anyway, a good book like the ""For Dummies"" series Music Theory for Dummies actually does a good job of not overwhelming you while using some practice examples.  You can also just google or YouTube the genre + ""chord progressions"" you're interested in as genres sometimes follow the same writing patterns.  Then, you can experiment with your own variations."
abletonlive,3d914w,MondoHawkins,3,Tue Jul 14 16:11:21 2015 UTC,"First learn how a scale is constructed, starting with the major scale. Then learn how chords are constructed from a scale. Then learn how chord progressions are put together to make a song."

That's a bit of a stretch if you're talking about using Push in scale mode.  Sure, all music is written in a key, but that doesn't mean that it all only uses notes from within that key, which scale mode does.  One of the very first theory concepts one learns when learning functional harmony (pretty much what comes immediately after learning your scales/keys and how to build chords) is the concept of a secondaary dominant, which always requires at least one note from out of a given key."
abletonlive,3d914w,DogPoopBags,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:44:23 2015 UTC,"That's probably true of Push out of the box.  For example, I wouldn't be able to play (in real time) a diminished triad (unless playing in a mode other than Ionian) to construct a 7th chord in a major key using scale mode, but I could develop a Live device that could react to shift key or foot pedal device which could flatten dominant degree so I could play a diminished chord using a major scale mode.  This may seem to be at the junction of learning to just play in chromatic mode, in which case, you might as well play piano/keys, which I might agree.  I apologize if maybe that is a pedantic point, but it was more a demonstration that Push isn't necessarily limiting over playing piano (though if you can use both, all the better), but rather, most piano trained players know theory as a precursor to learning the instrument and that is what makes the difference, not necessarily playing piano/keys."

abletonlive,3d914w,jophenese,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:14:11 2015 UTC,"A majority of music, yes. However, much music is agnostic towards a key. Musique concrète, many types of serialism, abstract noise music, these modern methods actively move away from the idea of a distinct key. Another more traditional method would be most types of non-tuned or loosely tuned percussion music as they rarely have or need a defined key.  I don't mean to come off as argumentative but the point I'm trying to make is that if you look at music as needing common or popular structures, you will limit the possibilities that can be created in music.  And since this started about a discussion on the usefulness of the Push, I will say that by thinking about it as not a melody input device, other musical uses for it start to come to light. That's the beauty of a grid controller: its suggestions are the new and the different compared to a traditional diatonic or chromatic controller. Not more useful; just different."
abletonlive,3d914w,DogPoopBags,2,Tue Jul 14 21:20:27 2015 UTC,"I don't find your point argumentative at all, and it actually stimulates some thoughts about how 64 pad based controller should be viewed as both performance and songwriting instruments, as well as just generic input devices.  It's probably a good point to concede that ergonomically, for playing the Western chromatic musical domain, a keyboard/piano isn't quite equaled by an 8x8 grid but the flexibility offered by a grid layout can be translated to other, non-dodecaphonic paradigms much easier than a piano key layout."

I think you might be suffering from a common misunderstanding as to what a key is and how it's used in music. A key is the audiological phenomenon of there being a home note (the tonic) and the collection of relationships of all of the other 11 notes to that note. It includes the notes in the relevant scale, but also other relationships like secondary dominants and borrowed chords that use tones from outside that scale.   And while most popular Western music is written in a key, a very large portion of it includes some usage of non-scale tones, like the leading tone in minor and the notes of borrowed chords."
abletonlive,3d914w,DogPoopBags,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:37:33 2015 UTC,"Semantically, it might be more accurate to say the majority of music, even produced by the so called underground, play tones that all relate to associated heptatonic scale of the key.  A key relates the tritone to the tonic, but the tritone is seldom used, and when used, the effect is often ""amusical"" in a sense."
abletonlive,3d914w,brutishbloodgod,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:37:44 2015 UTC,"I think you're still off. One, the key is more than the relationship of the tritone to the tonic. That's just one of the relationships; one of the most significant ones because it plays a huge role in establishing what the tonic is, but it's not the only one. Chord progressions in popular music are generally functional, as are the frequently used plagal cadences, and the use of dominant chords (both primary and secondary) isn't exactly standard but nor is it uncommon. Anything coming from soul and R+B is going to have plenty of dominant chords and thus plenty of tritones. Adele. Alicia Keys. Amy Winehouse. And likewise, popular melodies are generally very modal, but non-scale tones, usually harmonic tones over borrowed or secondary dominant chords, aren't entirely rare."
abletonlive,3d914w,DogPoopBags,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:14:17 2015 UTC,"Sorry if I wrote that unclearly - I meant that a key relates a given tonic to its tritone as part of the key's properties among the tonic's relationship to all of the 12 semitones, inclusive of the octave.  I just picked the tritone as it has some unique properties.  But I'm not sure I understand what you mean as establishing what the tonic is as part of the tritone's property.  That seems somewhat backwards to the intuition, if only that any tone is the tritone of some tonic.  That seems to lend itself the the idea that the structure of music has importance in the implication of key, scale, and modality - that is, tone cannot be divorced from order without losing meaning although chords can certainly imply something themselves."
abletonlive,3d914w,brutishbloodgod,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:41:15 2015 UTC,"Ah, okay, I get what you were saying. For some reason I was thinking that you were talking about the tritone in the dominant chord rather than the tritone of the tonic. That's what I was referring to, and not in an especially clear way either, so the confusion is entirely my fault."
abletonlive,3d914w,elphnt,9,Thu Jul 16 20:56:51 2015 UTC,"Push for me is still the most incredible instrument - the flexibility and expression that I am able to get out of it is unparalleled. Comparing it to a Launchpad is futile IMO because the Launchpad has none of the features that make Push, Push. Velocity sensitive pads, a screen, encoders and Live control buttons (metronome, tempo, etc.) - yes you can get a lot of those thing with other controllers by setting up mappings and digging through pages or banks but nothing gives you quite the in-depth, hands-on, immediate control that Push does.  I will admit though that Push in its vanilla form is very limited so here's what you can do to beef it up:  ClyphX - with ClyphX you can setup custom Push actions like having it load into a particular scale layout when Live opens. As others have mentioned you can access notes that are not of the key by setting it to Chromatic Mode. I have ClyphX setup to automatically load Push into chromatic mode when Live loads. http://beatwise.proboards.com/board/5  Ubermap - This for me, is Push's killer app. By default, Push won't display all the controls for native Live devices or VSTs so you have to go back to the computer to change certain things but with Ubermap you can setup your own custom mappings and control groups. This absolutely changed the way I use Push. It's involves a bit of scripting but the scripting is quite basic. https://forum.ableton.com/viewtopic.php?f=55&t=201849  Just message me if you wanna learn more about any of these things. Always happy to help :)"

It’s great for musical sketches, if you have set up templates. It sucks when it comes to integration of non-Ableton plug-ins. Also, I still catch myself at staring at the screen and occasionally grab my mouse. But in general, it’s still one of my most used DAW equipment."
abletonlive,3d914w,elphnt,2,Tue Jul 14 14:18:31 2015 UTC,What do you mean by sketching songs? Mind explains the process?

No matter what controller you're using you're going to have to set up some kind of Macro controls or custom mappings. As far as I know, Push is the best for controlling non-Ableton plugins that currently exists, except for now maybe the Akai Advance series but that's very specialised.  You should check out Ubermap - it might solve a lot of your 3rd Party Plugin woes. https://forum.ableton.com/viewtopic.php?f=55&t=201849  Just message me if you have any questions or want to get a bit more out of using Push with 3rd Party Plugins.

And I 100% agree with everything u/dogpoopbags said, except that I courteously disagree that sticking within a scale should be enough.  We've all heard the heptatonic scales so many times, our ears our more than ready to accept non-chordal tones.  (I mean if you're in C major, should you rely on equipment that makes a Eb chord impossible?  Bb?  All notes are valid.)

But it's a good place to start.  I have a personal philosophy along the lines of that there are many ways to break the rules but to find the best ways, learn the rules first.  Hence, I think learning Western music theory is a starting place for how to work outside it.    I am acquainted with conservatory trained musicians who cannot stand jazz because of how if snubs so many of the rules of classical Western composition and songwriting :)  I also know a few Jazz musicians (instrumentalists is a better term perhaps) who are insufferably stuffy as well, and snub anything but avant-garde pseudo chaos, and anything ordered is constrained and unnatural.  I guess I hope my point isn't interpreted as a proclamation to study and implement music theory and structure so academically that it comes at the expense of sucking the fun and creativity out of music."

abletonlive,3d914w,crownthrowaway,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:20:03 2015 UTC,"What are your views on Push? I, personally, now see it as a glorified midi controller that excels at launching clips/scenes in ableton—hardly a reason to keep it anymore in my book.   This is why I sold mine pretty quickly. It's main benefit are the self-assigning encoders, but other than that it's really not the amazing ""game changer"" they try to sell it as. It's bigger and bulkier than many other, similar controllers and honestly takes up too much space. I'd much prefer something smaller, particularly for live performance.   Despite the fact that it allows you to tweak some parts of live by default, you still have to do loads of preparation for sets anyway (especially for sample heavy music). On to those piano lesson, I suppose.   This is why I really don't like any DAW for that matter. Yes, they're powerful, but you are still forced to create music in a very inorganic, counter intuitive manner. I started in a band setting and decided to go solo, so for me I'm very much used to just picking up an instrument and just playing the thing. You can't do that with any DAW. Sure you can use your pad controller or keyboard to create an idea on the fly, but at the end of the day you still gotta sit there and tweak everything.  That's why I place a lot of hope in the concept of a ""computerless"" setup. Create something like an advanced Electribe with a built-in microcomputer and a decent amount of power and you could finally have a way to create music in a more organic, natural way."
abletonlive,3d914w,FargoFinch,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:41:44 2015 UTC,"I too also feel somewhat crazy for not really being a huge fan of the Push. I was kind of disappointed by it for another reason: it didn't feel like a very ""productive"" way of controlling Ableton. When I had one, I really should have just viewed it as a really good midi controller, but with all the hype about making tracks/sketches with Push, I was trying to use it for that purpose. Aside from the note mode, everything else felt just ok. (I absolutely hated how much I had to use those squishy buttons around the side. It's not that they felt bad, but you really had to put a lot of force on em: not fun after like twenty presses!)  If I had viewed it as just a midi controller, I probably would have liked it a lot more. I'm slowly moving to an all hardware setup for the tactile feeling that I want."
abletonlive,3d71an,diddleherontheroof,2,Tue Jul 14 00:49:11 2015 UTC,"Probably, but they will also probably have packs that come with certain levels of license too, like if ableton 10 was launched and you upgraded to the suite you were given all the push packs too. Personally I've never seen an absolute need to have 64 trigger pads. I use a korg nanopad2 that just changes its sample layout per section. The samples are setup in various drum racks all on the 1 track, and the drum racks are just automated to turn off and on as the set cycles. But to each is own. I suppose to some people it would be like taking a pianist who is used to 88 keys down to 16. lol"

abletonlive,3d71an,theredwoodcurtain,2,Tue Jul 14 15:16:11 2015 UTC,"I'd guess that the drum racks are in an instrument rack with buttons mapped to the individual on/off buttons through MIDI or with a macro mapped to the selection layer to cycle through.

abletonlive,3d71an,ohkalenaw,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:08:20 2015 UTC,"its really simple, but ive explained it wrong, what I meant was 1 Group rather then 1 Track.  So each track in the group is a midi track that is always Armed. AND where the drop down box that says ""All ins.."" just make sure that is set to your midi device. Each midi track has its own drum rack with the 16 samples setup to my nanopad2 layout and the odd midi track is setup with a series samplers within an instrument rack. Then you just use automation to turn the drum/instrument racks on and off without turning off the miditracks. Or if you are feeling a bit more midi savvy use another midi controller and setup button to turn the racks on and off."

If you want to have separate inputs or mix audio with MIDI channels then you need to use then group tracks. Group tracks are useful when you have similar sounds but want to sequence them separately. For instance, I'll often put a Drum rack and an audio track with percussion loops into the same group track for ""Drums"" processing.  OTOH instrument racks can do lots of things with MIDI split and chain selection that's very hard to do in the regular mixer. Look in the I/O tab of the instrument rack for the Vel/Key/Chain options and a world of possibilities is revealed."

abletonlive,3d4ge6,theredwoodcurtain,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:04:33 2015 UTC,"Not a live set then. Most important preparation: Pre-warp your tracks! And save those warps. You don't want to do this on the fly unless your tracks are straight 4 to the floor affairs, and even then there might be slight tempo changes. If you prewarp those tracks, you can be confident to throw in any track in sync if remaining time is short.  Furthermore, prepare a proper mixing template with your preferred devices and midi mappings. Get familiar with that template until you can control it blindly.  In contrast to popular opinion Live works very well for DJing - I prefer it to Traktor. But you can't skip the warping unless you like surprises."

Another thing I would suggest is giving yourself things to do on stage and not just fiddling around with knobs the whole time. I try to keep as much of my set live as possible and stay engaged in the performance the whole time.  I would definitely not recommend prerecording the whole thing, as that takes away your ability to respond and react to the crowd. Prepare twice as many tracks as you will need, label with bpm and what not, and lay it out in a way that you can understand.  In terms of effects, keep things simple. Give yourself a filter sweep, a beat repeat, phaser/flanger, and, most importantly, a tempo knob that goes from your slowest to fastest tempos (i.e. 90-135).  Finally, PRACTICE."

""Gain staging"" has been an effective mix strategy for me when making electronic music. Basically, mixing as you go along. Makes the final mix down faster. Basically, setting your drums up to be, say, -6db, and balancing everything with the drums.   Another technique, that I've found quite useful, is turning your volume all the way down and slowly turn it back up. If you start hearing something before everything else, than that's too loud. Keep doing this until you start hearing everything come in at the same time. Useful until you develop your ears and know what to look for."

abletonlive,3cv4ol,insolace,5,Sat Jul 11 00:58:13 2015 UTC,"I'm the creator of the video and am happy to answer any questions that people have on this subject.    Some info:   I use a Mackie DL32R as an audio interface and live mixer.  Each instrument group (click, synths, drums, vocals) has it's own output to the mixer over USB, and all recorded tracks from the mixer comes back to Ableton through USB as well We have a four channel headphone amp and use wired in-ear monitors, fed from aux sends on the mixer.  I've rigged custom cables for our Guitarists, you take a stereo cable and rig one side for guitar and the other for headphones, so that their in ears plug in right next to the 1/4"" cable that plugs into their guitar. The custom plugin I'm using to navigate to the songs in the set is a Max for Live device that I made.  It sends out MIDI notes for each listed song, which I loop back into live to trigger the location markers.  There's a text file it loads that reads the song list, starting with the MIDI note number to trigger (ie ""1 Sideways"" shows up as ""Sideways"" in the list and sends MIDI note 1 when triggered)."

I want the two mappings to only be enabled when one device is selected, and if I turn a knob while one device is selected it won't affect another that is not currently selected.

abletonlive,3co51i,ALPHAJOHNSON,7,Thu Jul 9 12:38:04 2015 UTC,I recommend using cables of some kind to connect your turntable to the interface.  Which cables you need depends on what kinds of inputs and outputs you have.
abletonlive,3co51i,theredwoodcurtain,2,Thu Jul 9 13:20:28 2015 UTC,"Having a built in phono preamp may well mean there is no ground wire on your turntable. If that's the case you can just plug directly into your interface. The inputs of the Scarlett are balanced, so to achieve stereo recording you'll need to use two channels as mono, set to Line. The cheapest/quickest route would be to stick a couple adapters on the RCAs coming out of the turntable."
abletonlive,3co51i,djfoundation,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:06:34 2015 UTC,"ok i have tried this method and while it works, i am getting a very trebley sound out of the record and pretty much no bass. is that normal, or should I be getting a fuller sound? because when I listen to the record on my speaker it sounds normal."
abletonlive,3co51i,djfoundation,2,Thu Jul 9 21:57:42 2015 UTC,"If it sounds quieter and missing part of the signal, it could be the RIAA pre amp not being present in the turntable. If that's the case, you'll need a stand alone pre amp after all. Was this deck from a home stereo all-in-one setup? Is there a ground wire on it?"
abletonlive,3co51i,mcgillycuddy412,3,Fri Jul 10 14:19:23 2015 UTC,I actually got it al sorted out! You were right about the preamp. I had to buy one at guitar center then I linked it with my audio interface with a quarter inch. Thanks for the help!
abletonlive,3co51i,francocroft,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:48:40 2015 UTC,"Also, you will probably need to ground your turntable somehow. Tbph, I don't have much experience with vinyl turntables (I'm a digital kind of guy) but many vinyl ones that I've seen have a cable extending from it with a small, metal two-prong connector that is meant to be the ground. If and when you get your turntable plugged in and working with your audio interface, you will still probably have a noisey signal without using the ground."
abletonlive,3co51i,joeyirv,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:46:40 2015 UTC,Does your turntable have a USB port by chance? Some of the modern ones that have a preamp built in actually have a USB sound card too and can be pulled straight into Audacity.

abletonlive,3cntch,natufian,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:27:24 2015 UTC,"Alright finally off (got caught by the train on the way in).  Watched the video; that is really strange. You definitely want to start by narrowing down if the Launchpad is sending too many notes (unlikely), or displaying too many leds for some other reason.    Start off by disabling everything Launchpad in the MIDI tab ( INPUT: track & remote, and OUT: remote ) with the exception only exception being you'll leave OUTPUT: track lit up.  Now for your MIDI in on your ""lights"" track set the MIDI IN to ""none"" and the MIDI OUT to your Launchpad  then in your ""lights"" track make a new MIDI clip that'll play every note for a whole octave in sequence from, say, C4 through C5.  Does this play a single note at a time? This at least help up narrow down where the problem is.  Let me know man, good luck."
abletonlive,3cntch,natufian,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:39:03 2015 UTC,just a stupid question how do I do the last part? How do I make a midi clip that'll play every note for a whole octave?

The tricky thing about this kind of setup is if you want to have different sounds on the same pads for different songs, if that makes sense.  Check out stuff on mapping the chain selector in instrument racks.   Alternatively, some or all of you could launch clips in Session view simultaneously, with a grid controller of some kind.

I haven't found a way to get it to automatically rename the notes to exactly which kit I'm using in Superior Drummer (Avatar, Metal Machinery, etc) but I have made a midi effect rack with each note accounted for that I could just go through and rename each of them manually. I might do that and save the racks for future sessions."
abletonlive,3bwjrh,DogPoopBags,2,Thu Jul 2 22:19:32 2015 UTC,"What are you trying to sequence?  I find that the instrument or drum rack configuration can really affect how painful or painless doing mouse sequencing is.  You can rename drum rack pads, and if the type of sequence you're constructing lends itself to being put into a drum rack, I'd suggest doing that.  As for configuring instrument racks for sequencing melodies, here's my TL;Dr is thus - I think if you take the time to build flexible racks, the MIDI editing is easy, and conversely, if MIDI editing or playing in live is a breeze while being expressive and nuanced, you've designed a good, flexible instrument.  You give an example of playing a muted E1, which I assume you might be building an instrument rack to simulate the playing a stringed instrument like a guitar or bass.  In that case, I wouldn't want certain keys to play with different dynamics, just like on a real guitar or bass.  When you mute a guitar, you play the same note just as you would unmmuted but with a bit of palm near the bridge to get the sound you want.  My point is, it's not like fretting the guitar is the primary thing that induces the difference in the dynamic of the sound.  Thus, you could design your instrument rack this way, where you all the notes are the sample of the guitar unmmuted, and you have a second chain with muted notes and can switch between them.  There are even more seamless ways to link the sounds using velocities and envelopes so that when you play the keys/draw in your music, it could sound like natural pick playing, but if you play with half velocity/draw in half velocity, it could sound like finger picking, and if you played with almost no velocity/drew in almost no velocity it would sound like a muted guitar etc.  And you don't have to use velocities - you could have it register off something else entirely, like a shift button, or whatever you want.  Again, I think if you take the time to build flexible racks, the MIDI editing is easy."

Slight differences between left and right can be achieved by a lot of things. In synthesizers you can let the pitch be slightly different for each side. Or you can delay one side for a few ms. Also you can create a rack with two chains, one is panned to the left and one is panned to the right. Then add the same effects (or not) to both chains with a little bit different parametersettings."

There's a rule of thumb, I don't remember it exactly but I think the norm is to never pan anything more than 30% from the center (at least in dance music). So, do whatever you want between the left and right channels, but always check your mix once in headphones and once in mono to make sure it works, and if you've gone too far, just change around your effects in each chain to make them less different until it sounds ok. Also, familiarize yourself with Utility - it is, as the name suggests, very useful for a lot of things!"

abletonlive,3bhtsz,Aerocity,11,Tue Jun 30 11:24:05 2015 UTC,"For those who don't want to leave reddit, here are the improvements and feature changes:      Added the Tuner Device to the Live audio effects.    Added a ""Start Playback with Tap Tempo"" preference to determine if Tap Tempo is going to activate playback.    Improved tempo detection for warped audio files where the tempo appears to be constant.    Improved warp downbeat detection.    The first warp marker (1.1.1) is now placed closer to the beginning of an audio Clip, even if the that portion of audio does not contain loud transients.    Improved the sound of Complex and Complex Pro Warp modes.    Added the option ""Warp Selection as x-Bar Loop"" in the context menu when right clicking on a time selection inside an audio clip.    Live Sets that contain Max for Live devices or third-party plug-ins now have lower latency.    The latency introduced by a device is now displayed in the status bar, when hovering over the title bar with the mouse. No latencies are shown when latency compensation is turned off.    Automation and Modulation are now fully latency compensated.    Modifying the Arrangement loop brace with mouse or keys will not affect the current track selection, while previously all tracks were selected as soon as the braces where adjusted with the mouse.    The Serato bridge is now compatible with Live 9.2    Scrub and Ram Mode are now exposed in the python API    Added support for the Roland A-PRO keyboard series    Most presets in “Sounds” and all presets in Operator have been updated to react to Aftertouch and/or Modwheel data.    Updated 808 and 909 Kits with better sounding Kicks and Snares.    New 606 & 808 Impulse presets have been added to the Core Library.    Core Library Audio Clips now load with HiQ enabled and Fade disabled.    The preferences setting ""Start Transport with Record” has been renamed to ""Start Playback with Record""    Updated lessons and info texts.    Dropped compatibility for Windows XP and Vista, OS X 10.5 and 10.6.   There are also bugfixes and push changes, but I figure 90% of users are primarily interested in the above"

I left out the Bugfixes since it's a pretty long section and I don't want to crowd the thread  Changes for Push   Added 64 Pad Drum Rack mode for Push. The Note button now toggles between the Drum Rack three section layout and the 64 Pad Mode. Improved aftertouch response and added an aftertouch Threshold setting in the Push User Preferences Added Modwheel functionality for the Push Ribbon Controller. Tapping the Ribbon Controller while holding ""Select"" toggles between Pitch Bend and Modwheel function. Holding ""Delete"" and tapping an encoder on Push resets the respective parameter to the default setting. Holding ""Shift"" while turning an encoder on Push changes the respective parameter with finer resolution. Improved buttons readability on Push. The Repeat and Metronome buttons now blink if active. When recording using Repeat on Push, the MIDI notes would be recorded with a negative offset with respect to the grid if the option “Reduced Latency when Monitoring” was on. This caused the very first note in the Clip not to be played back at all. Using ""Shift"" + ""Add Effect"" or ""Add Track"" while in Scales mode would cause the display to show the Note Layout options even after releasing the Shift button. When selecting a Drum Rack Pad set to Multisample mode with Push, pressing “Device In” with Push would automatically select the first device in the Chain list, and it would not be possible to go back to the enclosing Instrument Rack device."

I updated OS X to Yosemite (I was on 10.8), updated most of my plug-ins, and heavily cleaned my template. Started a new project last night and the bug is completely gone. So happy. :)"

Sent the info to Ableballs but was wondering if anyone found a working combo of both! (I guuuessss I could go back to 32 bit Live but that suxxx)"
abletonlive,3bhtsz,maxoreilly,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:32:08 2015 UTC,So what are the scrub and ram modes now exposed in Python? Are they something to do with Push?   I'm currently in the process of trying to expose as much of the Python API to a network as I can but I've not heard of these features before.

abletonlive,3bhtsz,dudenotcool,10,Mon Jun 29 12:29:21 2015 UTC,Read the release notes.
abletonlive,3bholg,whywaitforit,14,Mon Jun 29 08:40:45 2015 UTC,"As I said elsewhere:   Pick a sub.  Whichever sub is getting left behind, turn off posting. All the mods of the old sub get selected as mods for the new sub.  Perfect time to see if people are still okay with being mods.  If we end up with less mods, ask the users who wants to be a mod. Give the users a determined amount of time to repost whatever they want from the old sub on the new sub.  Everything goes.  If it's a link, post the link again.  If it's a self post, post the reddit link. Hold a contest for a new banner.  IIRC, the banners for both subs are old.  Even if they're not, so what, it's a celebration. Have a collaborative assignment.  Make it a sub compilation.  Let anyone join in.  Do it yearly.  I believe /r/Cyberpunk_Music did this a couple times., and that's not even a sub based on making music."
abletonlive,3bholg,kidkolumbo,4,Mon Jun 29 22:39:39 2015 UTC,I think the reason now is that mods/users don't want one subs archive to be deleted.
abletonlive,3bholg,Gyroo-,8,Mon Jun 29 09:20:50 2015 UTC,"Solution, make one sub no longer able to have posts, but include in the sidebar to search it.  Or give the users a week to repost links to the older posts on the new sub."
abletonlive,3bholg,kidkolumbo,2,Mon Jun 29 19:59:18 2015 UTC,This.
abletonlive,3bholg,Someuser77,3,Mon Jun 29 22:23:09 2015 UTC,"Is that a thing? You would think that the archives would just be merged too... I know it's possible when I've seen other subreddits merge, specifically when a new game comes out that's a sequel they generally merge all the things and stuff into one. Just watched it happen with The Witcher 3, I think 3 subreddits were merged there."
abletonlive,3bholg,Gyroo-,3,Mon Jun 29 10:48:46 2015 UTC,"I don't know if its possible, that's just what I remember from last time this thread came up."
abletonlive,3bholg,arxior,4,Mon Jun 29 12:38:08 2015 UTC,makes sense! Lets make this a thing again

abletonlive,3bholg,MrTheDevious,2,Tue Jun 30 05:40:20 2015 UTC,I'm pretty new to both subs.  Can somebody briefly explain why there are two different ones in the first place?
abletonlive,3bholg,kidkolumbo,3,Tue Jun 30 00:50:25 2015 UTC,"IDR why it started, but the last time it was brought up they didn't want to merge because a mod of one of the subs regularly posted in racist subs, and the other sub didn't want to become a part of anything he had a hand in.  He's now gone."
abletonlive,3bholg,MrTheDevious,3,Tue Jun 30 00:54:59 2015 UTC,Thanks!  Decent enough reason for sure.
abletonlive,3bholg,theotherverses,2,Tue Jun 30 02:00:55 2015 UTC,Would be great to merge the two. Pretty silly to have them both.

As it stands a big thing getting in the way is the limited storage space. I got the 128GB i5 model, which I thought would be enough for my library (about 25-30GB as it but I could stand to chop quite a bit of that down) but since Windows itself takes like a third of that space that leaves me with like 80GB, which is a bit too close to comfort for me imo so I'm waiting of getting a Micro SD or something like that."
abletonlive,3bd1wd,Need_a_Ladder,9,Sun Jun 28 01:50:20 2015 UTC,"You can use the Velocity midi effect and set the high and low midi outputs to the same value. Then no matter what velocity goes in, the same value with go out."
abletonlive,3bd1wd,N-Code,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:08:54 2015 UTC,Do I have to do this for each set though? I know FL studio has an option to disable it permanently
abletonlive,3bd1wd,altdecay,9,Sun Jun 28 05:38:39 2015 UTC,"Make a new midi track, put the velocity effect on it, max out high and low limits. Now, right click the top of the track (where its name is), and click save as default midi track. Now all of your new midi tracks will automatically have that velocity effect inserted, maxing out the input velocity."
abletonlive,3bd1wd,AHandsomeNeckbeard,2,Sun Jun 28 07:23:36 2015 UTC,"Alternatively to what u/altdecay suggested, you could load that into one midi track and use that midi track as the midi in for any tracks you wamtes it on. This would be effective for removing velocity from a given external instrument. Instead of selecting the instrument itself as the source for the midi track, you'd just be selecting this other track."
abletonlive,3bd1wd,BeatsNpieces,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:48:27 2015 UTC,You can also set the minimum and maximum velocities on your MIDI controller. Either use your manufacturer's editing software or refer to the manual for onboard editing.
abletonlive,3bd1wd,Junkis,2,Mon Jul 6 03:30:38 2015 UTC,"Set the vol<vel (or just vel) to 0% if you're using ableon's built in stuff. The no matter how hard you hit the keyboard, the instrument doesn't take it into account.  If using a 3rd party plugin either find where velocity is managed or just manually edit them in the piano roll after playing."
abletonlive,3bd1wd,Runaway_5,0,Sun Jun 28 15:41:19 2015 UTC,Depends... Many instruments have the option including any samples in sampler. You can just set the velocity to 100% and all hits are max velocity.
abletonlive,3bd1wd,Junkis,2,Sun Jun 28 02:17:41 2015 UTC,"Not quite. It means its sensitive 100% to your velocity. For instance, a note hit at 30 will play at 30 through the sampler.  If OP wants all the hits to be the same, he should put it at 0% on the sampler. Then it won't take velocity into account, regardless of the midi velocity in the piano roll or how its played."

abletonlive,3b7wke,EllisDelta,2,Sat Jun 27 00:33:52 2015 UTC,"I have a Casio PX-150 right now. However it has it's pros and cons. I chose it because it's small in height, so that it fits under my monitors, white, because I live in a very small space and try to keep everything bright even with so much stuff in here and it has a decent tone and feel. I had a Yamaha DGX before and I only sold it because someone offered a lot of money for it, which I needed at that time. However three days later it happened that I got my paycheck and found that I can not produce music very well without a decent piano so.... I bought a new one.  I can only recommend going into a store and trying some keyboards! In the end it's you who has to be happy with it so why count on others to select one. If you don't mind buying used I can really recommend that as well. There are so many people out there buying a digital piano for their children, who half a year later lost any interest in learning how to play it so the parents decide to sell it. Usually you get a great instrument for a much cheaper price and often even under warranty. Good luck :)"
abletonlive,3b7wke,tilldrop,1 point,Sat Jun 27 07:45:23 2015 UTC,"thank you for the reply!  How do the keys of the casio compare to the DGX?  Do you only use it for controlling your DAW or does it come with good sounds as well?  I would like to go to a store to try one, but the nearest guitar center (or really anywhere with a decent keyboard selection) is 1.5 hours from me, so I'd like so jump off points to get started.    BTW, not sure how much this info will change your answer, but I played classical piano for 8 years so the feel of the keys is the most important factor for me."
abletonlive,3b7wke,EllisDelta,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:48:22 2015 UTC,"Your experience with real pianos and will definitly influence your thoughts on digital pianos. From what I remember I liked the DGX's keys better. I have had digital pianos only (for about 4 years now), have had only one year of piano lessons (but on a digital piano) and have occasionally played on a real piano. Therefore I definitly do understand and feel the differences between cheaper and more expensive digital pianos and also the huge difference between real and digital pianos in general.  You will always, even when playing on a $2000 digital piano, feel a huge difference to a real piano. However between real pianos there also is a huge difference.   Therefore I really strugle to recommend any keyboard. It's too much about the personal preference and experience.  I have never really used neither the Yamaha DGX (which came with a few hundreds of soudnds) nor the CASIO (which only does a very few) as real instruments. I have always only used them as MIDI controllers. A friend of mine has a Yamaha CP1 and there is such a big difference in both sounds and keys. I guess it's ""you get what you pay for""."
