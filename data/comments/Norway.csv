Many of the top CEOs in Norway are alumni from NHH. And I'm not biased or a graduate myself.  The 2014 employment market survey says that 70% of the graduates had a job before they finished their studies. After 6 months 83% had a relevant job and only 3% were unemployed.  http://www.nhh.no/no/studietilbud/jobb-og-karriere/arbeidsmarkedsunders칮kelsen.aspx   The 2015 numbers will most likely be worse due to the downturn in the oil and gas industry.

Then, as a non-EU citizen, studying does not mean you can stay in the country or apply for PR, you will need a job offer. Your English needs to be on point, and you will probably need decent Norwegian. But as to how discriminatory they are, it's really hard to say. From my limited experience, Norwegian firms are reluctant to hire foreigners for language reasons, as well as just that many people here know someone who knows someone and that just in itself helps firms recruit. So if you use the time studying to also build something of a network, that will definitely help, but how much? Who knows. Maybe you're really charismatic and every firm would love to have you. Maybe you blow them out of the water with your Norwegian. But the soft skills are what will get you far, top grades help, but that's never the whole story. Lykke til!"

Norway,3dxbvw,Antonskarp,5,Mon Jul 20 12:11:10 2015 UTC,"Yea, I've been watching a Swedish show about those dialects. Forgot what it's called.

Norway,3dxbvw,Sn3ipen,2,Tue Jul 21 09:37:58 2015 UTC,"What I've heard about Swedish dialects is that the worst of them are usually isolated pockets and seldom spoken in 'full', for instance the ""Dalarna"" which I suppose is more fairer to call a language in itself.   I think what really makes the difference with Norway and Swedish in comparison to dialects and spoken language is that you lot have ""Rikssvenska"" which is also an oral/spoken standard, whereas in Norway our standard languages* are only written.   This you'll also see in Germany where they have Hochdeutsche (High German) which is spoken standard, and you have other examples with English Received Pronunciation and in France ... well, it was just French (or 'Metropolitan French'). The thing about the French, though, they standardized their language far earlier than most and had centuries with education and teaching the 'right' way of French which has caused an almost unparalleled lack of dialect variety in the country.   The point is, that with a standardized spoken language you'll see the dialect-variety becomes less when everyone is taught at school the 'right' way of speaking, as well as media having it's share.    .* Norway has Standard 칒stnorsk which is a socialect and most of Oslo and the outlying area speaks this form of sociolect. But it isn't a normative or official spoken language."
Norway,3dxbvw,DeSanti,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:16:52 2015 UTC,"You aren't correct when you say there is not a normative standardized spoken language in Norway. It is not official, but we do have one. For instance, in my town of Trondheim the buses have a system where pre-recorded messages are played announcing the next stop. These messages are recorded in the voice of a man from Trondheim, but not in his native dialect. It is recorded in the standard spoken Norwegian. If it were not, the bus company would get in trouble with Blindeforbundet (the Asssociation of the Blind).    In addition to this, until 2007 all journalists at NRK were required to speak in a standardized language while reporting the news. This would not be possible if we didn't have a standardized spoken language."
Norway,3dxbvw,Antonskarp,2,Tue Jul 21 06:24:51 2015 UTC,"Your first example seems much more like a case of 'toning down heavy dialect' than there being a 'standard spoken language', as Bybanen in Bergen has a woman with a Bergen dialect speaking, though really at that point it's more a matter of inflection and accent.   The second one kinda proves my point. We could say there was an official/standard spoken language for media presenters but that's now been discontinued.   I say it's not normative because it isn't. There's no model or ""correct"" way of speaking it, with regards to inflection, accents or thereof. Neither Spr친kr친det or Det Norske Akademi has any guidelines or regulations with Standard 칒stnork and it pretty much sails its own boat."
Norway,3dxbvw,DeSanti,2,Tue Jul 21 06:33:40 2015 UTC,"Actually, Norway isn't very special when it comes to dialects. Many countries have similar varieties and quantities of dialects.

Norway,3dxbvw,FonderPrism,3,Mon Jul 20 20:35:49 2015 UTC,"And our dialects are often used in media. Compared to the UK for example, where they almost always use reporters who speak RP instead of their accent."
Norway,3dxbvw,turkeysrule,2,Mon Jul 20 22:06:12 2015 UTC,"While this is somewhat true, I wish people would distinguish between media and reporting.

You won't hear much English RP on BBC Wales News and BBC Scotland News, nor BBC Radio York, or BBC Radio Leeds."
Norway,3dxbvw,Joe64x,2,Tue Jul 21 03:32:26 2015 UTC,"I was thinking mostly about what you'll hear on the ""regular"" BBC news, as that's comparable to what we hear on the Nrk news. Nrk uses plenty of reporters and program hosts who speak in their own dialect, rather than Bokm친l/eastern Norwegian. Obviously local stuff will have local reporters who use their accent."
Norway,3dxbvw,turkeysrule,11,Tue Jul 21 09:27:43 2015 UTC,I think Danish and Swedish tv programs and movies also helps us. Growing up I could hear a lot of Swedish for example by watching Emil I L칮nneberget and Pippi Langstr칮mpe.

Norway,3dxbvw,hardcore_fish,9,Mon Jul 20 15:46:23 2015 UTC,"Norway has been in union with both Sweden and Denmark, so it's perhaps not entirely coincidental.   And I think most adults grew up watching Swedish TV as well as Norwegian. Lots of co-produced TV shows with SVT and Swedish TV shows as well. We also had regular programming of Finnish TV theater, but that had a different effect... Mosty remember drunk people screaming at each others deep in the woods."
Norway,3dxbvw,kvitrafn,4,Mon Jul 20 12:12:01 2015 UTC,"I did a sociolinguistic study on the use of written dialect in Norway earlier this year in University. For my literature review, I reviewed many of the studies referenced in the Wiki article, particularly Maurud (1976) I went into some depth on.  The sense I got from reading broadly on the subject is that the reasons why we seem to understand the other Nordics (apart from Finland) better than the other Nordics understand each other (and us) comes down to a combination of factors:   Standard written Norwegian (Bokm친l) is based directly on Danish, which gives us an inherent advantage in understanding there to such an extent that often you will see on product packaging that manufacturers don't even bother separating the two languages, listing the ingredients/instructions under ""NO/DK"". The reason for this, which also adds to our advantage, is that we used to be in a union with Denmark and had their language 'pushed' on us as the erudite language. Such influences linger. Similarly, we've been in union with the Swedes, and the same things happened. In fact, often you can make your Norwegian more understandable to Swedes by using what Norwegians would consider more 'old-fashioned' words. These are words that exist and are understood by Norwegians, but have fallen out of daily use. Still, perhaps the most significant reason why we have such an easy time (relatively speaking) understanding the other Nordics is because of the vast dialectal variation in Norway. Not only do we have A TON of dialects to go around (there used to be a saying that there were more dialects than people, which may not have been much of an overstatement), but the relative differences between them are also vast to the point that some dialects at the extremes are actually mutually unintelligible. Which isn't uncommon, but it is worth noting considering our high level of linguistic understanding.   It is well established in the field that multilinguals learn and understand new languages more easily the more languages they learn. There is also a fair amount of research that seems to indicate that people from countries (or, specifically, regional communities) with wide dialectal variation, or even multiple widely spoken languages (multilingual societies), like Norway, Switzerland, Eritrea, Slovenia and a host of other countries, seem to learn new languages more easily than those from decidedly monolingual countries with little dialectal variation (like, say, England). It has been hypothesised that this is related to Piaget's schema theory, that multilinguals have 'wider' schemata for language, enabling people to rely more on assimilation for learning, and requiring less of the 'more expensive' accommodation processes. Since Norwegians are trained from birth to hear and understand a very wide variety of dialects, and are often exposed to both Danish and Swedish (primarily through entertainment media), this leaves us with those wider schemata. And then we go on to learn English from a very early age, too, further widening those schemata.  So yeah... hold on to your dialects, folks. They improve our linguistic abilities :)"
Norway,3dxbvw,BJHanssen,2,Tue Jul 21 09:08:59 2015 UTC,"I did a sociolinguistic study on the use of written dialect in Norway earlier this year in University.   That's very interesting! I personally use my dialect when texting/messaging friends and acquaintances from my local area, and I've noticed some regular peculiarities and standardizations. Care to tell a bit more about your study?"
Norway,3dxbvw,vincent_elf,2,Tue Jul 21 12:56:28 2015 UTC,"Sure :)  Some key points:   It is fairly well established in the sociolinguistic literature that a lot of computer mediated communication is closer in nature to spoken communication than it is to written communication. It has been repeatedly observed that text messages, instant messaging and in some cases e-mail follows the rules of spoken conversation more closely than the stricter, more formal rules of written correspondence. Norwegians generally give their dialects high prestige, often going so far as viewing standardisation in speech as something to both be avoided and derided. There is a lot of pride in dialect in our country, and it is closely tied to our personal identities.  This explains why written-down dialect is so common in CMC (computer mediated communication) channels like SMS and so on; for many, it simply feels 'wrong' and 'fake' to not use their dialect in these settings, since they instinctively consider it a form of speech rather than writing. Thus, ""I talked to my mother on Facebook the other day"" is a statement that people don't think twice about. Now to my results. The specific research project looked at the Facebook conversations of a family group primarily from Northern Norway, with a view to figuring out how participants choose what form to use (dialect or Bokm친l/Nynorsk) and, in turn, why they make those choices. The research looks at the conversational level, so the comments section on the Facebook posts on the particular FB group, only looking at the posts themselves as a potential point of context for the choices in the comments. To quantise my data I chose some common Norwegian words and indexed their use in the various dialectal orthographies within the data (for example, dere/dokker/d친kker). Three hypotheses were tested and failed: First, that the primary influence of choice was age. This failed outright when looking at the data; there was no significant correlation between the age of the participants and the form choices they made. Indeed, the oldest of the participants was actually one of the most orthographically liberal (but still consistent!) of the participants compared to standard Norwegian. The second hypothesis was the the primary influence would be technical skill, that those who were more comfortable with the devices and software they use would be more comfortable using more dialectal forms. This was also refuted by the data, which actually surprised me a bit. Third, I hypothesised that the device with which the participants accessed Facebook could affect their orthographic choices. The idea behind that was that some mobile devices use dictionaries to auto-correct toward the standard. To test this, I chose a few participants whom I knew used mobile devices and looked at their data. Even a cursory glance disproved the hypothesis, as several people who only access Facebook via mobile devices exclusively used dialectal forms. One even used the most liberal forms indexed, and very consistently at that. The fourth hypothesis tested was what I dubbed the equal response hypothesis; this suggests that respondents will choose a form that matches that to which they are responding. My initial results from testing this hypothesis were positive, but not conclusive. At this point, I had been going over the data for weeks and I was starting to see possible patterns in my mind, so on a hunch I adjusted for dialectal likeness in responses. Basically, I eliminated responses from people whose dialect was far removed from that to which they were responding (southerners responding to northerners, mostly). This significantly strengthened the results in favour of the hypothesis.   TL;DR: Dialects are thought of highly in Norway, and their use in written computer mediated communication is only natural. Age does not appear to be a significant factor in who uses written dialect (in this group). The primary rule for choosing dialect or standard appears to be 'equal response', meaning that a respondent chooses dialect if they are responding to dialect, and if their dialect is close to the dialect they are responding to.  As for standardisations, there was plenty of evidence of that. All in the direction of Bokm친l, interestingly, since at least some of the participants use Nynorsk as their primary written form.  I theorise that this is because Bokm친l is considered the neutral written standard (largely independent from dialect), while Nynorsk is a non-neutral written standard (dependent on dialect). There is some previous research that vaguely suggests this, too."
Norway,3dxbvw,BJHanssen,4,Tue Jul 21 18:36:37 2015 UTC,"As a native English speaker, I find Norwegian much harder to learn than Swedish.  And forget Danish - I hear what they are saying and look at the word and throw my hands up."

Norway,3dxbvw,perrrperrr,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:46:26 2015 UTC,I have no idea why. It could be that I studied Swedish first so I'm more comfortable with it.   Off the top of my head what makes Norwegian more difficult is the orthography - bookmal doesn't always sound as it's spelled which is the case much less in Swedish. Then there are quirky things like making the possessive case have a definite article and then having to put the pronoun after the noun (e.g. s칮steren min vs  min syster).    Edit: also there are two genders in Swedish vs. three in Norwegian.

Norway,3e0vcw,hooahguy,6,Tue Jul 21 03:13:24 2015 UTC,"It's not impossible to see aurora activity that early in the year, but you have a lot of things going against you.  Peak aurora activity is usually in October and February/March so early September doesn't present very strong opportunities for visible aurora activity, but I have seen aurora in the late summer/early autumn. I took this just outside Br칮nn칮ysund on 28 August 2013 (kp rating 5+ iirc). But by all accounts this was a lucky storm during a peak season of aurora activity.  In order to see aurora in Trondheim the kp needs to be over 4 (the higher the better); and kwowo is right, aurora in Trondheim doesn't compare to the aurora seen further north. Usually it's a faded green, like this one I took last (mid-)September kp rating over 7. (note: I feel it goes without saying, but this has had post-photo editing (almost all aurora photos have)).  My best advice is to look up at night. It wouldn't hurt to keep an eye on the european aurora service's page to see what the aurora prediction is."

One of the major sports shops has then on sale at 500 NOK most winters, they are worth buying at that price if you live here.

Among the big and nationally available banks, ""yA bank"" has had the best rates on deposits. They have a somewhat shitty UX, but you can use any ATM and pay in any store for free. You use the same account for savings and ""brukskonto"". I've had most of my money with them for ages.  Skandiabanken is a different option if you want to use an online bank. Their rates are good but not the best, but they have very good UX.  To become a customer, just go to their respective home pages. You will need a passport or a BankID account. If you would like a BankID account, just go to a DnB branch and ask to open an account and get a BankID account and they'll fix you up for free. Then ignore DnB from then on.  If you want a bank that has local branches in Bergen, Sparebanken Vest is also an option. They don't have the best rates either, but they're still somewhat present in the city with a couple of branch offices."
Norway,3dx9iu,marvin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:18:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  I'm not sure I understand the DNB/BankID account.  This means I have an account with DNB - but never use it?  I only need the number to open accounts at other banks?  I've looked at the site sturle posted, above, and saw that for example Santander bank offers a deposit account of 2.50% - is that about in line with yA bank?  (I've gone to their site, but they don't have pages in English - and I don't speak any Norwegian yet - so I can't quite figure it out.  For some reason, google translate won't work - seems that the page is images, not text.)  Thanks again."
Norway,3dx9iu,marvin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:26:18 2015 UTC,"Ya bank has 1.8% annual interest rate on deposits, but no limitations on usage or withdrawals. Santander probably has, but I'm not sure. (You should also check if your bank is member of ""Bankenes sikringsfond"", the national deposit insurance program. All Norwegian-owned banks are, but I am not certain that Santander is. Probably is.)  BankID is a national digital ID system. You can get BankID if you get a bank account at any bank, but BankID is separate from your bank account and you can use it for free to authenticate forever, for any bank or national digital service such as the tax authorities. If you ever lose your ID dongle, you can order a new from the bank that issued it. And yes, my suggestion was to get a bank account with DnB and never use it, only using it to open an account elsewhere.  You become a customer with yA bank here: https://ya.no/H%C3%B8yrentekonto/s%C3%B8knadsskjema-konto-h%C3%B8yrentekonto  I think yA bank lets you authenticate with a scanned passport and then sends you their own BankID credentials. They'll send you some papers to sign and require you to send a photocopy of your passport + signed documents in return. So if you become a customer with them, it might not be necessary to do the convoluted DnB step above. Keep it as a plan B if yA bank are a hassle to work with for a foreigner."

Norway,3dn1jb,Fontpage,34,Fri Jul 17 18:04:30 2015 UTC,"The good thing about Norway's hydro power (or H.P. in general) and its connection to the European power grid is that we can stop/start generating power at a very short notice. Solar/Wind/Wave-power are all dependent on the weather while coal power is most effective when it runs at a constant production 24 hours every day, otherwise energy is wasted heating up the parts which cooled when the power plant ran under capacity.  This means that Norway actually imports power from the rest of Europe during the night or if, as in this case, too much power has been generated by Denmark's wind power stations. We then either pump out less water from our dams or we actually pump water uphill to the reservoir. This is especially during the night when coal plants produce power while the power consumption is low. The electricity from hydro power is then sold back to Europe during the day with a small profit as electricity prices during the day are higher than during the night."
Norway,3dn1jb,tomnor,2,Fri Jul 17 18:17:32 2015 UTC,"Adding to this, Hafslund has marketed prices for guaranteed green power for their customers at an additional premium.

The past couple of days have been extremely windy, and the import from Denmark has gone up compared to just last week.   It's a dynamic image though, impossible to just take a snap-shot and claim it as truth for anything other than that moment.  The article is technically correct."
Norway,3dn1jb,VikingTravels,5,Sat Jul 18 14:06:56 2015 UTC,"On a particularly windy day    Exactly the problem. Denmark is still going to need something to generate the base load, for days when it isn't windy. And then when it does blow, it needs to store or otherwise get rid of the excess power. Sending it to Norway is actually a good way of doing that, because as /u/tomnor points out, the hydroelectric power stations can be dialled up and down on short notice."

The bid wars can get pretty crazy. A house in Land친s recently sold for 2.25 million OVER the listed price."
Norway,3dn3na,Proud11B,0,Sat Jul 18 23:39:05 2015 UTC,"I think you would need to define what you mean by ""cheap"" (and not only the total cost, but cost per m2), and what you mean by ""in"" the ""big/main cities.""  In the center of Bergen, an actual house - and not a large one, and one which needs lots of renovation - will be a minimum of 500,000 NOK (if you can even find something for that price); in the outer areas, for a spacious, updated, single-family house, I don't think you'll find anything for under that price either - and there are many, many more that are well about those prices, up to about a million.  Maybe I have a different definition of ""cheap."""

Norway,3dn3na,n00bface,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:31:48 2015 UTC,"Prices are the same as you describe here in Oslo, except instead of homes it is 30-40 m2 apartments in quieter neighborhoods. I have been looking into buying a place around 50 m2 in the city center and have been struggling to find anything for less than 4 million. A lot of foreigners looking at real estate prices on finn.no are deceived because a lot of properties can be bought for cheap, but still have a significant sum of debt (the fellesgjeld) which the new owner inherits. So you can buy a 50 m2 apartment in the city for 500k, but then you also inherit 3.5m in property debt which you will have to pay off in several installments, usually monthly. This also means that in order to buy these places you'll basically have to go through the same credit/background checks that you'd need to go through to get an equivalent sum in loan from a bank. I guarantee you that there is not a single flat in this city @ 50m2 that is under 3 million with the debt included.    Another issue is that the listing price is more often than not LOWER than the price that the place will end up selling for. There are bidding wars in Oslo for properties and a rule of thumb is to assume you will pay up to 10% more than the asking price to win the bid."
Norway,3dn3na,DeSanti,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:00:17 2015 UTC,"That is more a range I would have expected.  Although I don't understand fellesgjeld.  What debt are you inheriting exactly? Is it only for when you are buying the right to use the property and not to actually own the property (like condos in the US)?  If so, that sounds a lot like housing associations in the United States."
Norway,3dn3na,Proud11B,3,Sat Jul 18 01:10:44 2015 UTC,"Nope, it's a bit different. Imagine that a new complex is being built, so the company that builds the complex takes out a loan for 20m NOK to build 10 units. Then the units are sold for whatever price, and each tenant then inherits 2m in debt which they have to pay according to the original loan agreement."
Norway,3dn3na,wellio7,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:17:27 2015 UTC,"In the city are many residential buildings which are owned via a housing cooperative. Which means there's not one firm that is the owner of the entire building itself.   So when you buy a flat or apartment there those co-ops have a ""communal debt"" which pays in for mortage loans, maintance, structural changes and so on which is managed by the board members (which are people living in the building).   So when you buy an apartment there, it's pretty much like with a lease from this co-op."
Norway,3dn3na,TheEndgame,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:54:57 2015 UTC,"Okay, it is similar to housing associations and rental boards in the US. Here buying is more expensive, but the dues are less expensive."

Norway,3dn3na,wellio7,2,Sat Jul 18 06:00:39 2015 UTC,Looking at national statistics the median household income after tax for couples in Hordaland county varies between 480-830k a year. In other words it isn't really affordable for the median couple. To even get a loan you need 15% of the property value in assets. That equals 825k. The household savings rate in Norway is around 10%. That means that we are talking about saving for 10-20 years from scratch to be able to afford it. As someone mentioned above you should have room for almost 10% more since the bidding can push the price up even further. So who are the ones buying these properties? It's the ones that have already entered the market.Getting 825k in assets is easy if you have a property to sell. A freshly established couple will most likely have to settle in a smaller apartment or live further away from the city centre.

Norway,3djyy2,BoratRemix,3,Thu Jul 16 21:50:56 2015 UTC,"Yes, heavily.  It's not the companies though, it's the route you're traveling that is subsidized.  Fjord1 may have other routes that are not subsidized at all, but the main ferry routes in Norway are all subsidized, apart from the one that carries the most passengers, Bast칮fergen Moss - Horten  A few years ago there were quite a bit of media attention to a couple of routes that were subsidized 2000 NOK per journey.  We want people to live in hard to get places, to keep everyone from moving in to the town and cities. In addition to all the ferries, we have a lot of tunnels in Norway, about 1000 in all, most of them in the west / north-west."
Norway,3djyy2,VikingTravels,2,Thu Jul 16 22:22:33 2015 UTC,Thanks.  How controversial is it?  Are there any political parties that oppose heavily subsidizing?  Is the money coming from the local level or federal level?
Norway,3djyy2,VikingTravels,5,Thu Jul 16 23:27:44 2015 UTC,"It's not the most controversial topic here, and there are more and more tunnels and bridges instead of ferries.  The controversy is usually about toll-booths and for how long they stay, even after the cost of the road has been covered by those paying to drive through the toll-booths.  Most parties in opposition will be heavily against subsidizing, as it's an easy target to aim for.  When Fremskrittspartiet came to power in the coalition government, their previous stance on ""lower subsidizing and fewer toll-booths"" were still something they strive for, but it's difficult to alienate so many of your voters in one swift go.   The political landscape feels rather homogenized in thinking that we need people to live on the coast, in the valleys, north and west, and not just in the larger cities. This comes with the cost of subsidizing bridges, ferries and other transportation infrastructure that needs to be in place for people to live there.   Edit: I hope someone with a better understanding of this topic comes along and spreads some knowledge."

Publishing his name, especially since the sentence was so light, would have been a clear breach of the press ethical code.  In fact he is worse off than if his case had been in Norway. Since the Irish press has published his name, unless he changes his name, everyone he meets from now on, new girlfriends, friends, employers, landlords etc will find those article by a simple google search of his name.  Whether the sentence in Ireland was fair is a completely different case. Without reading the complete case I have no idea."
Norway,3debkn,FargoFinch,8,Wed Jul 15 18:02:43 2015 UTC,"Singular rape cases, suicide and other taboo doesn't get attention in Norwegian media. I guess the culture here is to respect perpetrators' right for anonymity, unless the case in question involves someone in high and important positions.  TBH I don't think it's wise blowing up such cases. Now Hustveit getting away with it despite him confessing is certainly wrong(unless there is some special circumstances surrounding the case), in most cases of rape which doesn't involve assault like alcohol related incidents the question of guilt is often very difficult to answer in court."
Norway,3debkn,VikingTravels,-2,Wed Jul 15 17:28:57 2015 UTC,"While I agree with you to an extent, it annoys me that he is not being rehabilitated. Even if the Judge had included counselling or therapy as part of the sentence, then it would not be so difficult to take, but this was not part of the sentencing at all.  It is important to note here - the only reason the Irish Press were able to name him is because the victim waived her right to anonymity, which in turn gave way for him to be identified. She did this in order to let others know about this guy, and if she had not have done this, we would have no clue.  I have no particular problem with Norway being the bastion of human rights which they self-proclaim (I agree with rehabilitation and not revenge), but sometimes you have to take a step back and really take a look at it from an outside perspective - it is disgusting that he got only a suspended sentence with no stings-attached, and can go about his life in Norway, with no onus on him to let people (i.e. girlfriends etc) know about his conviction."
Norway,3debkn,not_real_8712,8,Wed Jul 15 17:50:30 2015 UTC,"I have a hard time understanding what you're trying to say here.  Why is this related to Norway ""being the bastion of human rights which they self-proclaim""?  His court appearance was in Ireland, the Irish court decided on suspended sentencing, this has nothing to do with how Norway goes about human rights?"
Norway,3debkn,not_real_8712,5,Thu Jul 16 13:15:46 2015 UTC,"Note: I was (until recently) connected via friends with Magnus Hustveit on Facebook, had no idea about all this until I read a previous post here. This is not my real account.  I have quite a few friends in common with him, and have met him on a couple of occasions. As said above, I had no idea about this, nor do I believe any of the other people we know in common knew. He is in a relationship with another woman and there are some kids , but I do not know whether he is their father. As far as I can tell from the articles I have read about the case, his GF knows about the case, and supported him in Dublin. I am not friends with her on FB, but I see she has pictures and checkins from Dublin on her profile from last week.  I note that Hustveit seems to have deleted his FB profile, probably a wise move.  Note also that he have always seemed to me as an ally of feminists and women's rights, so having him be an admitted and convicted rapist makes it even more creepy.  As the facts of the case are presented, and the fact that the sentence was a somewhat lengthy prison time, I must admit to being rather disappointed that all of it was suspended, and that he is pretty much a free man. But then again, I am generally let down by sentencing of rapists. He appear do have destroyed a woman's life with only regard to his own pleasure, some punishment would be appropriate.  When it comes to naming the perpetrator: As other people have said, it's generally not done here in Norway. While I can certainly understand this position before a guilty verdict, I am personally leaning towards letting the victim in a violent crime deciding anonymity for the person convicted (as identifying the guilty might in some cases also identify the victim)"
Norway,3debkn,thekkel,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:34:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your input, it was very interesting to hear this.  Regarding your point:   I am personally leaning towards letting the victim in a violent crime deciding anonymity for the person convicted (as identifying the guilty might in some cases also identify the victim).   This is exactly what the victim did in this case. She had the right to protect her own anonymity of course, but she chose to waive this which in turn allowed the perpetrator to be identified.  To be completely honest, I do feel somewhat sorry for the perpetrator hear. And let me explain why - he is obviously a sick man, and with the end of this case he has been given no order to attend therapy. Therefore he is not getting the help he needs. This is a serous issue, and he needs to be treated by a professional.  I know nothing about Norwegian Law - is there anything in your Statutes whereby a citizen convicted in another jurisdiction can be ""guided"" by the Norwegian authorities to undergo therapy etc? Surely this should be a priority of the Norwegian authorities."
Norway,3debkn,thekkel,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:38:21 2015 UTC,"I am not a lawyer, so I don't know about your last point. As far as I know, there is no such thing.  What could have been done, if his connection to Norway was one of the reasons for suspending his sentence, is to convict him to X time in prison, possibly suspend Y of it, and figure out a deal with the Norwegian government to have him serve his prison sentence in a Norwegian prison. I know this have been done before, especially where the nationality of the convicted person and the country where the crime happened is both in the EU/EEA."

But that's not the fault of Norway, but rather that of the Irish justice system."

I don't know why you're angry at us, the Irish are the ones that aren't giving him a proper sentence.  The whole article seems to lean on misinformation, too. Take this quote;   But having sex with someone who is asleep or otherwise not able to give consent is rape, and this should be included in Norwegian law, as well as in all other countries.   This is flat out wrong. Here is the direct quote from the Norwegian law on rape:   b)    har seksuell omgang med noen som er bevisstl칮s eller av andre grunner ute av stand til 친 motsette seg handlingen   Translated, by me:   b) has sexual intercourse with a person unconscious or otherwise unable to oppose the act   There have been plenty of cases in Norway just like this. It is almost never ruled as rape since it's very hard to prove. The same is true for the case in Ireland; The Norwegian wrote an email telling his girlfriend that he had sex with her while she was sleeping. The judge said it would have been impossible to judge him had he not written that email.  And naming rapists is very, very dangerous in Scandinavian countries. We have pretty strong female rights movement here, so-called feminists, where some are all about the shaming of men. Being stamped as a rapist, even being accused of rape, is a brand you'll live with forever here.  A famous Norwegian politician, a woman called Valgerd Svarstad Haugland, famously stated that ""if the [rape] case against you was dismissed on evidence, it did not mean you were acquitted"". That is a very generic, and very dangerous claim.  You can read more about it here, though you'd need to get it through Google Translate:  http://gammel.pfu.no/case.php?id=2667  I support the line where we're careful with naming rapists. We have, however, had a recent case where both name and pictures has been used. Like this one;  https://www.frieord.no/innenriks/julio-kopseng-domt-til-16-ars-forvaring-serievoldtekter/  16 years detention (detention here means that you're up for evaluation after 16 years - you're not a free man) for multiple rapes."

There has been a decline in the amount of feature films for the last couple of years, as a lot of productions has moved their principal shooting to low-cost countries in the eastern Europe. The good thing is that there have been a rise in TV-series productions, so all in all it's not a problem.  I've been working mostly with commercials the last couple of years as I like the more intense shooting periods with more time off between jobs.  It's a pretty small industry, so most og the people in the industry know each other.

More information about what you need here:  http://www.finanstilsynet.no/no/Revisjon/Tilsyn-og-overvakning/Krav-til-konsesjon/Soknad-om-konsesjon/Soknad-om-godkjenning-som-registrertstatsautorisert-revisor-/"
Norway,3d3k5p,solvi,3,Mon Jul 13 06:54:24 2015 UTC,"That's for auditors. Becoming a certified accountant is less demanding: https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autorisert_regnskapsf%C3%B8rer  However, you can work with external/financial accounting without having any kind of certification as long as you work for an authorized accountant or auditor. (This is fairly common for fresh graduates, as both require a certain amount of practical experience before you get the final authorization.)   The two accounting standards used in Norway is the local Norwegian one (following regnskapsloven (accounting law), and a set of generally accepted accounting principles (not your GAAP, but what we call NRS) determined by Norwegian accounting tradition), and IFRS (you probably know, or have heard of this one). The latter is mostly used for larger firms, and due to EU regulations, all publicly traded firms. We don't use the GAAP, but the IFRS is probably pretty close. There are some differences, as outlined by PwC here.   If you want to work with internal accounting, e.g., management accounting, you don't need any kind of authorization. We mostly follow the same traditions as American firms (e.g. maximize efficiency of capital, cut capital costs where possible; all in order to maxmize profits for owners), but some thoughts from the German tradition still remains (e.g. more focus on marginal costs; the focus is less on reducing capital, but rather maximizing its utilization). The latter is probably very useful in a country that has extremely strict laws for how and when we can fire people, and where most of the capital is of the intellectual kind.  If you understood what I was talking about above (disagreeing is fine, I'm often wrong), you should do just fine adjusting. The language is another barrier you'll have to struggle with. For most people, that's probably the hardest thing.   Source: MSc. in Management Accounting and Control and currently pursuing a PhD in Management. Feel free to PM me if you have any questions."

Norway,3d2m59,kwowo,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:05:30 2015 UTC,"Norwegian is not fairly easy to pronounce. Norwegian is not a phonetic language, the words are not pronounced as you read them. I have never heard a native English speaker pronounce Norwegian words correctly, particularly r-/rs/rl/rn-sounds, as they are completely different than in English. And I'm not even including 칝, 칮, 친. Similar words, and loan words, are common in quite a lot of languages. In Russian you have both similar words and plenty of loan words (eg. 햟햧혟쮏/ayfon/iphone or 혣쮏햦햫햡/shopping), that does not make Russian an easy language to learn.  When it comes to grammar, Norwegian has three genders, and each noun associated with one specific gender. To know which noun belongs to which gender you have to memorise each one because there are no simple rules to follow. I don't see how saying it is 'an easy language to learn' is going to help anyone. You can make yourself understood by saying 'jeg vil ha den hus', but it is still broken Norwegian and if you are serious about learning another language it should be done properly."

Norway,3court,op-will-deliver,3,Thu Jul 9 16:09:45 2015 UTC,"Well, the modem you have to BUY off them is a massive ripoff, at least with other providers they rent you one and you can send it back and say no thanks I got my own.  I don't know which city you're in, but for most of Oslo even if you go with a different provider you are still using Telenor's lines so you won't get any better speeds.  As to your needs 20/2 is the best value for money when it goes back to original price. Me and my SO have a 30/10 equivalent and that is more than enough for 2 phones, 2 pcs and a tablet running and internetting at once."
Norway,3court,Holybasil,2,Thu Jul 9 19:30:24 2015 UTC,"Being ADSL what is the most important is how far you are from the nearest phone central. The farther you are the lower the speed. The first thing you need to find out is how far you are and what speeds they are actually able to deliver to you. Even if you live in a city, line quality is also an issue. So try finding out what they can deliver to you first, then you will have a better picture of the offers."
Norway,3court,nechered,3,Fri Jul 10 05:51:41 2015 UTC,"And in my experience with ADSL providers in Norway is that they will overstate what is possible to deliver and will sell you the higher package. It will be your responsibility to test your speed and ""downgrade"" your price paid to what they can deliver to you."
Norway,3court,edbgon,2,Fri Jul 10 07:00:08 2015 UTC,"Having worked for a xDSL provider I can tell you this is technically not true. What happens is that is a discrepancy between what the line documentation says and what is actually on the field. So when the seller looks up your address the tool of the line-owner will state x meters to this address on this type of cable. And for that they can deliver X mbit. Problems is that the tool does not take a live measurement, so when the field engineer goes out he can discover that there is an undocumented problem so that the line can췂t handle that speed. Or sometimes the line seems fine and then when it starts being used one discovers that the line is in poorer condition than expected so the speed has to go down for the line to be stable. And yes sometimes an over-eager seller will sell ""too much"", but those guys are hated by the customer service. In the end what people do not realise is that this is a very old technology, in places in the major cities you can find lines from before WW2. And the company that owns all the phone lines in Norway is not really putting in money there anymore (let췂s face it fiber is the way to go now).  Sorry for the long post :)  edit: missing some words and lettrs :)"
Norway,3court,nechered,2,Fri Jul 10 07:12:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply, it sheds some light on the issue. It has happened three times to me when I was moving around a lot when I first moved to Norway. I just assumed that it was a typical sort of thing they did.  I wish I could have fiber. Now that I own a home here, I have been trying to get connected to the fiber nearby to no avail. Our only option is 10/1 which works good enough for me, but it isn't very future-proof."
Norway,3court,edbgon,2,Fri Jul 10 09:11:58 2015 UTC,"Happy to shed some light, I have had this conversation many times :) There is also a real possibility that the line will degrade over time as more and more of the cable gets used for xDSL. I have sent many engineers on a line that became unstable just to find out that the customer was on the best pair available so there was no other way than to downgrade the customer."

Not sure how that would work with a rental so just ask at the place you rent at.   The ferry depends on where you are. It can cost from 50-250NOK for the car (driver included in that) and a passenger can be 30-80NO. That is if i understood of the ferry pricing i found for one company. I would go with 250 for a car, 100 for a person and then i would feel safe i wouldn't be short on money."

A modern GPS will ALWAYS give you the boring route. Oslo-Stavanger is a prime example of a stretch that has this possibility, with E-18 being the fast one, and road that starts with road 313, 303 etc being the scenic ones.  BMW used to have a Scenic Route App, but it is 100% US centric now. You can do it with a normal paper map or you'll need some preparation using the GPS, to re-route to the scenic route.

Norway,3cnf9z,GloriousxLeader,7,Thu Jul 9 06:57:01 2015 UTC,"Very few international students are awarded scholarships here. One is the Quota scheme, a funding scheme offered by the Norwegian Government to students from developing countries in the South and countries in the Western Balkans, Eastern Europe and in Central Asia. There's the High North Fellowship Program that does include USA students, but only for students in selected fields. To find out if you qualify, check here.  Check the scholarships page on Studyinnorway.no regarding your options as a US student. If you have a family background from Norway, your chances might be good.  Even if you get a grant, you're going to need extra money. What is going to make it hard for you here, is cost of living. It is absolutely brutal for unprepared international students. A part of the application process is to document that you will be able to afford studying and living here. As a non-EU student, you will be able to work 20 hours a week MAX your FIRST year. Students must document satisfactory progress in their studies in order to continue to work part-time from their second year onward. Add to that that most employers require Norwegian skills and it gets hard for international students to compete with Norwegian students also hunting part time work.  The University of Oslo calculates that you need to budget 50.000 NOK for 5 months, that's around USD 6.100. During your first semester you have to calculate EVEN more because setting up your household and buying suitable clothing for the Norwegian climate will also be a sizable amount. So, a year's worth of living expenses means at least 15.000 USD, and that is modest living. Maybe you can make this work, you say to yourself, but the crux of the matter for many is that the Norwegian government requires you to document that you have the budget for this before you even step foot in Norway.  The painful reality of the situation is that to study here, you'll have to figure out stuff in your end, as in find opportunities in the US like scholarships offered there if you don't have the funds."

Berntsdtr is actually shortened for Berntsdatter(dotter/dottir), so it means daughter of Bernt. Patronymic (son of/daughter of) components in the name still lingered and were used in some occasions all the way up to the 20th century. Which in her case was used as a middle-name.   Another explanation could also be that Berntsdatter was her mother's surname which is more of a modern tradition to compose both your parents surnames together by having one of them (usually the mother's in the earlier time of the tradition) as the middle-name."

Norway,3cmnd2,Crozzfire,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:10:21 2015 UTC,"OK, thank you for your perspective!   In my original post I mistakenly left off a ""great"", meaning she is my great-great-grandmother, so even older than I originally indicated---born in 1866 in Hyllestad."
Norway,3cmnd2,Crozzfire,2,Thu Jul 9 03:23:36 2015 UTC,"Some quick research tells me that the usage of patronymics was only put into disuse first in 1923, when a law was passed in Norway ordering each family to only have one last name, wherein a family might use the patronymic of the family head. A origin of some names like ""Jensson"" or others of the like.   Her being born in 1866 certainly puts her well before the law was passed, and with some certainty, your great-great-great-grandfather was named Bernt."
Norway,3ckodl,RedMcGibonNaziHunter,4,Wed Jul 8 17:37:07 2015 UTC,I would actually advice you to bike from Kristiansand and north via Stavanger. Any local tourist office would help you plan the best rout. Are you planning on going to Nordkapp?
Norway,3ckodl,AtheosWrath,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:58:26 2015 UTC,Interesting. Is that route more scenic or bike friendly? I'm not sure how far north I planned on going but did hear of a wild sanctuary and thought that would be neat. I believe it was up there in the arctic circle. Thanks for the advice.

Norway,3ckodl,autowikibot,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:21:19 2015 UTC,"Bergen Line:       The Bergen Line (Norwegian: Bergensbanen), also called the Bergen Railway, is a 371-kilometre (231맔i) long standard gauge railway line between Bergen and H칮nefoss, Norway.  The name is often applied for the entire route from Bergen via Drammen to Oslo, where the passenger trains go, a distance of 496 kilometres (308맔i).  It is the highest mainline railway line in Northern Europe,  crossing the Hardangervidda plateau at 1,237 metres (4,058맍t) above sea level.   The railway opened from Bergen to Voss in 1883 as the narrow gauge Voss Line. In 1909 the route was continued over the mountain to Oslo and the whole route converted to standard gauge, and the Voss Line became part of the Bergen Line.  The line is single track,  and was electrified in 1954-64.  The Bergen Line is owned and maintained by the Norwegian National Rail Administration, and served with passenger trains by Norwegian State Railways (NSB) and freight trains by CargoNet. The Fl친m Line remains as the only branch line, after the closure of the Hardanger Line.  The western section from Bergen to Voss is also served by the Bergen Commuter Rail, and was shortened following the 1966 opening of the Ulriken Tunnel.

The train towards Rygge leaves at 15:02 and 16:02. It arrives at Rygge station 15:53 and 16:52, and the shuttle arrives at the airport 16:05 and 17:05.  So technically it would be possible.

If you want peace and to sit alone on the bus, you can get it. Easily.   And if you want to talk to people, you can't easily do it. ;-)   We have something called Janteloven here. It basically means that you shouldn't think you're something special, even if you are. This means a lot less bigotry, and a lot less smug bastards. I'm actively breaking this rule right now, but I don't really care.   I don't think most people would agree that Janteloven is a categorical positive.   Melkesjokolade is amazing   Of all the candy produced in Norway, you chose this? It's pretty much generic milk chocolate. Good quality, yes, but go to Switzerland and splurge on chocolate and I dare you to come back and claim that Freia Melkesjokolade is anything particularly special.

I've had it happen to friends in both Oslo and Trondheim. There are also still many people who are still afraid to come out, especially if they live in smaller towns.   Even worse, if you're transgender and want to undergo gender reassignment surgery, Norwegian law requires you to be sterilized.  Finally, Norway prohibits egg donation and surrogacy, greatly reducing options for gay couples (not to mention straight couples where the woman is infertile.)

I understand that Norway bans the use of carbon monoxide used to keep meat unnaturally red, but we had the same law in my previous country (in the EU), and the meat never appeared like this.  Every grocery store - from the high-end to the discount - had ample supplies of fresh meat (at reasonable prices).  Frankly, judging by the packaging dates alone in Norwegian supermarkets, much of the meat on the shelves is clearly old, and should be eaten at one's own risk.  There's a difference between meat that is naturally oxidized (thus not fire-engine red, and beginning to brown on spots), and meat that is indeed gray-ish.  And if you look at the old, dessicated, browning vegetables that often line the shelves - which are clearly not fresh - it would be naive to believe that the meat is not likewise past its prime.

Both us danes and the norwegians mostly target Sweden in these jokes because history and just occasionaly eachother, but there is rarely anything real to the ""hate"". It's most likely brotherly teasing, especially here on reddit."

Offense is taken, not given."
Norway,3chmzv,LordHy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:32:14 2015 UTC,"Norway could definetly do more in ways of being Pro LGBT. Most at my workplace laughed when I asked if they were going to the Pride parade (and they asked if I was gay because only gays attend it)  On a side note, I went with my children and SO to the pride parade and later I read that a hundred thousand had attended the pride parade in Oslo, a hundred thousand in a city that inhabits more than a million in the city+surrounding areas.  Reykjavik, Iceland gets 100 thousand+ on pride parade, a city that has around 150 thousand inhabitants in the city+surroundings."

Norway,3chmzv,LordHy,2,Thu Jul 9 04:55:16 2015 UTC,Being pro-LGBT is not the same as being pro gay pride. Even gay people might dislike pride parades. They are not for everyone.
Norway,3chmzv,autowikibot,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:17:12 2015 UTC,I'd think the parade is more pro-pride. Pride in having come so far in rights regarding our civilization/community.
Norway,3chmzv,AtheosWrath,2,Thu Jul 9 04:54:18 2015 UTC,"But still, a lot of people don't like attending parades, no matter the theme. Janteloven could also be part of why far fewer people attend these parades in Norway. Let people have equal rights but just cause you're lgbt doesn't mean you're special."
Norway,3chmzv,LordHy,0,Thu Jul 9 06:42:43 2015 UTC,"Janteloven is only a paragraph in a book. It's not actual law. If it were actual law,  then there'd be same wages for the same work, and with total disregard to your religious or sexual orientation, you'd have the same equal  rights as everyone else in the country. Norway would truly be the greatest country in the world if it reached equilibrium in human rights. Until then, the parades will be a good reminder of how far we've come, but also how far we still have to go."
Norway,3chmzv,VikingsInTheRain,2,Thu Jul 9 07:29:23 2015 UTC,"Well, janteloven isn't a law but more of a mentality. But I do agree, there is still quite a way to go if you want to reach full equality in the terms of rights. And if they feel like they need to parade, let them parade. Just don't pass judgement onto me for not being a ""parade person""."

Both Kjerag and Preikestolen is awesome, if I had to pick one I would do Preikestolen. -Night life in Bergen is nice, but not the best on a monday, especially during summer. However, there are many nice places to go. Fl칝yen is a scenic and a quick trip, while Ulriken is a bit longer and higher. I might go Fl칮yen and go further in towards ""Rundemanen"" - the trail up fl칮yen starts from the city centre, Ulriken does not.  -You do not need guides anywhere you are going. But check out ut.no before starting. You can also buy some maps at a bookshop, I would recommend this because it is easier to get the lay of the land etc. And since you are hiking a lot anyway.  -I assume you have checked out the buses? Because you might find that they dont fit your schedule, that you wont have time to both hiking and the bus-trip for instance. -Also, think about the amount of activity you want to do. You have quite a lot fitted into a small time window - that perfectly fine, but are you sure that everybody wants that? Also, is everybody in your group in okay physical shape? None of the hikes are very hard by themselves, but might be tiring day after day if you are out of shape."

Be sure to read about the hikes though (www.ut.no), as being unprepared can cause trouble when the Norwegian weather kicks in.  If you are looking for something to do in Flam and is interested in a good brewery, this is it. http://www.flamsbrygga.no/en/aegir-brewery/ Several good pubs/bars in Bergen, a bit depending on what you like. ""Henriks 칒l og Vinstue"" has probably the best beer selection, ""Ujevnt"" is great for drinks and atmosphere (though Mondays are a bit slow for the whole city), ""No Stress"" can be great (and they have Nintendo 64 with Mario Kart!) Driving is fairly problem free. We dont have the best roads in the world, but if you are a normal driver there are no issues. (The road from Tyssedal to Skjeggedal (start of Trolltunga hike) is real narrow and a proper pain in the summer with all the traffic.  If you have time, do both.

I know a few people use the festival as insurance scam, so the actual thefts are most likely less than the 500'ish number (one very common case is drunk people dropping their phone into the chem-toilet, people often report them stolen rather than admitting to be stupid).

I mean, we were drunk and laughing, so it was ok... right?  They could have had their wristbands changed to warning bands for stealing our flag (or downright cut, police at Roskilde are taking a stand on stealing, regardless of what gets stolen), but we didn't report them (other than clean out loud is aware of the incident, so they are probably not going to get approved again).

I'm more into design & pre-sales roles so that may change things for the roles I was looking at. I eventually got an English only role with a company in Oslo providing global services. So opportunities are out there but the better your Norwegian the better your chances.

For you, working in IT will enable you to find a job easily where Norwegian is not the main language used. However, my advice is that when are here, you continue to make a conscious effort to speak Norwegian where possible. I am now proficient in the Oslo dialect, but the one shock I found is how the words change in accordance to the dialect of the person, but after pushing myself I am now able to understand people from outside of Oslo with greater ease. Do you have any connections to Norway such as friends of family? The reason I ask is that while Norwegians like to socialise, they can be relativity cold at first. Also, where in Norway will you be moving?  Need any more help feel free to contact me ;)"

I think I will be heading to Oslo for work for sure unless I get lucky and find a job local in Fredrikstad, Sarpsborg etc. I have Family and Friends in Norway yes so I am staying with them at this current time while my search goes on :) How long did it roughly take you to speak good/fluent Norwegian? :) Thanks again!"
Norway,3cail9,SomeoneNorwegian,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:02:13 2015 UTC,"Well I had a month course in London, an hour a week with a teacher and my wife is norwegian so I started to learn way before I wanted to move, but only basic shit like 'head,shoulders, knees and toes' haha... When I arrived I lived with her grandmother for 4 months and she only speaks norwegian and loves white wine, so the best teacher. It was intense, but hey now I'm at a good level and didn't have to go to any lessons, I still want to but people say it would be waste due to my ability to speak and understand. I just think emerging yourself in the language is the essential, and get involved with the family and friends network as this will help you to propel in learning etc. I have friends from the UK who haven't had the advantage of having a norwegian collective to fall into, and you can see that they love it here but not from a norwegian context. So use what you have mate, oh and don't give a shit about what people think when you speak norwegian, go in head first.

I am a lot more confident with my norwegian now than I was a couple of months ago. I am learning different words every day and I think living in the country is the best way to learn a language as you interact with it every day!. How is it with the driving?

Norway,3c1b5y,rdzzl,1 point,Sat Jul 4 09:39:25 2015 UTC,Yeah that's what I was looking for. In the normal supermarkets do they also have cheap dried food? Similar to this.  The normal supermarket food is usually cheaper than the outdoor stuff
Norway,3c1b5y,rdzzl,1 point,Sat Jul 4 09:16:03 2015 UTC,"Yes. You can buy that kind of Food for very little if you like. I'd urge you to go into ethnic shops though, if you want cheap Food to go. They usually only take cash (at least here in Trondheim) but are very cheap."
Norway,3c1b5y,odindillinger,3,Sat Jul 4 09:40:05 2015 UTC,"It's important to note that this trip takes 20 days not 12.  Let's break it down:  350km/20 days=17.5 km per day.  350km/12 days=29.1km per day. Combined with the h칮ydemeter(latitude difference?) of between (looks to me) 300-1000m that is one hell of a trip.   If you are a mountain army trained guy/gal you might be able to do it in 12 days. But let's assume you are mortal, and with no supply chains.  Fishing pole would be your cheapest alternative. There seems to be plenty of lakes on your route. They most definitely will have abbor or 칮rret, remember to buy fiskekort. The downside here is the added time you need to fish not walk(to put out a rod with a worm when you go to bed can be good)  In gr칮nland in Oslo you can buy cheap rice and beans and also nuts(not from nut boys, but immigrant shops) and other supply's. It's the cheapest you can find in Norway.  If you don't want to fish there is usually turhytter(cabins) scattered across the mountains with foodstuff you can buy(leave money in a box). Its all in ut.no. this is of course more expensive than fiing. I would not recommend carrying all your food supply as that would be a very heavy load.  Lastly I would recommend you learn fjellvettreglene as the mountains can be treacherous. http://www.fjellforum.no/topic/4416-the-norwegian-mountain-code-fjellvettreglene-in-norwegian/  Have a nice and safe trip! I'm super jealous. Sorry for my potato english."
Norway,3c1b5y,odindillinger,1 point,Sat Jul 4 12:20:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah I figured it would take me at least 20 days. I'm now looking into supply points and points where I can cut the trip short.  The route passes trough Rauhelleren, Finse, 칒vre 칀rdal, Tyinkrysset, Fondsbu, B칮vertun and Sottj칮nnbu. Would I be able to get cheap food there? It appears some of these are hytter, some appear to be bigger. I have a total of 30 days to wonder around, but I'll have to get food in places in between.  I will mostly use my tent, but I will also be taking a DNT key with me. In case I need a bed or shelter."

Norwegian women have to get a thicker skin with telling that they are not interested instead of trying to be polite, dance around the comments, and ignore them.

Considering 550k isn't terribly far off 300k x 2 it's certainly not impossible. A child of course can be an expense in itself... It's kinda complicated, look here, my wild guess is between 28-35%. The system we have is called progressive taxes, all the Scandinavian countries have it. The more you make the more you can afford to give back to the common good. In my opinion the medical care is on-par with the UK or any other leading European country. There are some waiting lists for certain kind of operations but never will you find yourself waiting if your life is in danger. I work in the health sector myself. Any person in suffering or danger will get immediate free care to the very best ability in Norway. Culturally in Norway it's deeply ingrained now that pre-school should be affordable and available for everyone. Fee for Trondheim country. General info Rent can vary wildly. 2 bedroom apartment would be probably between 8000-14000 per month.  Yes we have a very modern and extensive bus network. Fairly punctual, modern and clean buses. Covers all of the city. In fact it's probably one of the best in any Norwegian city. Though 550k is a very good wage to be offered I would be slightly worried about depending on just one person working. Ideally both you and your partner should work as it would give you a much better economy and stability. It's very uncommon now in Norway to have a family where the woman stays at home like a housewife. The whole economy and life-style here is expecting both partners in a relationship to work.   Also don't be afraid to Google! All the major government agencies (department of immigration for instance) all have excellent modern webpages with lots of information in English.

Norway,3byn3r,the--dud,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:03:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all the answers. Just what we needed. The wage question seems to vary wildly. The job would be in the IT sector so i would expect a slightly higher then average pay in any country really. Is it typical that there is alot of negotiating with an employer before a wage is settled on? Are thing like extra vacation days, flexable hours, or perks negotiated? Dont want to scare them off by being demanding but at the same time dont want to get steamrolled because lack of knowledge.  Thanks again"
Norway,3byn3r,the--dud,2,Sat Jul 4 08:13:47 2015 UTC,"I actually work in IT myself so this I can answer. Though in most lines of work in Norway you have standardized wages IT is absolutely not like that! So yes in IT it's very much expected to negotiate.   Be aware though culturally Norwegians hate it when people seem too obsessed with money or greedy. Negotiations can be a fine line because you want to show that although money aren't your primary motivations, nor to you wish to bleed them dry, you do want to make sure you get a ""fair pay"" for the job you're hired for as well as your qualifications and experience.  Vacation is strictly government mandated, but trust me we have an insane amount of paid holidays and leave here! Flexible hours tends to be something a business offers to everyone or nobody but it's certainly worth mentioning, if you have a great need for it I'm sure they can accommodate. Other perks kinda goes the same way too."

This means verbal agreements and e-mail are binding.  You have to be able to prove it, though. That means witnesses for a verbal agreement. For e-mail it is a bit more complicated. A court would examine:   If the e-mail was in fact sent What it contained, and the possibility that its content had been altered Did it reach its recipient Was it actually read by the recipient   So yes, it is legally binding.

Norway,3bupzz,ladyofthrowaway,6,Thu Jul 2 08:40:48 2015 UTC,"It was probably easier for foreigners to find work in Norway before the oil industry started slowing down as there are a lot of international companies in Norway who are in the industry.   However, depending on the job you're seeking and the company you're applying for, speaking Norwegian is really not a must-have but nice-to-have as almost everyone understands English.   Personally I have been working with an Indian woman since late 2012. She is a software developer, and hardly speaks any Norwegian still. We encourage her to learn it, as she misses out on a lot of social dialogue (i.e. not work related small talk) when natives speak with other natives - but we feel that it is up to her to join in. However, she does her job fine even though her Norwegian is very limited.   As long as you apply for a job where it doesn't matter which language you use, as long as you make yourself understood, you should be fine even though the job description asks for people who speak both Norwegian and English."
Norway,3bupzz,v3gard,3,Thu Jul 2 10:34:20 2015 UTC,"I would think Norwegian would be mandatory for HR roles...you're going to be discussing very sensitive things with potentially stressed employees. My experience as a job hunter who didn't speak the language is just to search for ""english"" and some other key word. Ads written entirely in English generally are ok with non-Norwegian speakers applying. Also you don't need to translate a full ad, just ctrl-f ""norsk"". My experience is different to your boyfriends and guy below. If they explicitly state ""we want a fluent Norwegian speaker"" they mean it, but then I work in a different industry - it may vary.  Finally just fire out your CV and talk to recruiters. I eventually got my job after one of the hundreds of people I spammed gave me an email months later. I'm EU citizen living in Europe so it was easy to hop over for a long weekend to interview & meet the team. You may struggle more being even further away without an EU passport. So be very aware the odds are stacked against you until you learned the language move closer. You want a company to take risk on a non-speaker who lives thousands of miles away and needs help with permits etc. Unless you're very skilled and experience there will be easier options for the company. And yeah say you are relocating to be with your boyfriend, common sense really."
Norway,3bupzz,winter-sun,2,Thu Jul 2 13:27:51 2015 UTC,"I have a friend who did this. He had a law degree from the US. It took him a while to get a relevant job with a large enough position to grant him the citizenship (think it has to be 100% or 80% or something like that.   I believed he was allowed to stay for a limited amount of time without a job because of his Norwegian wife. And he managed to make a mediocre living out of working the docks and other random jobs like that.   Eventually he got a position in a larger, international company. Not a lawyer position, but more towards logistics, middle management, international deals etc.   But as a lot of people are saying, it would have been a lot easier before the oil collapse. Now there is a lot of downsizing, thus a lot more well qualified competition for those type of jobs. And even before then, while living in Norway, it took him a while."

Norway,3bupzz,lagvvagon,2,Thu Jul 2 18:13:17 2015 UTC,"It's very hard to get a job in Norway without being fluent in Norwegian. Some roles even require you to be fluent in business conversation, not just daily conversation. I took 2 semesters of Norwegian lesson in the university and it didn't help a lot. Seeing that your partner is a Norwegian, it might be easier for you to catch up the skill by practicing every day with him.   It is not impossible, but it's tough. So far I've only seen a few people (of my friends) that mastered Norwegian in 1 year. In the engineering field, you might see 10% (or less) of the opening positions that don't require Norwegian skill.

There are three airports around Oslo that claim to be ""Oslo Airport"", they are all pretty far away from the city, and for two of them 1500 would be to expected. Also, where was the hotel? There are some hotels right next to airports, or there are hotels in Oslo centre.  In Norway anything ""luxury"" is expensive as all hell. This includes taxi, dining out, drinking out. Dining\drinking and the place has a great view, double the price. :)"

The flight-train from Gardermoen to Oslo-S is your best bet for your return trip btw. It's way less expensive, as is the flight-bus, which I assume also travels from Oslo-s or around. (I'm from Bergen so I can't be of much help with which firms to check with).   If they all agree that this is the normal price then I don't think there's much you can do about it.. :/"

If you can spare 30 minutes, take the regular, rust-brows NSB train. Much cheaper as it is subsidized.   (Flight train 180NOK/person, NSB 90NOK/person or less.)  The bus is slow and much more expensive than the train, and are primarily used by people who live between the airport and the city center - as it is more convenient for them."

The town center is very quiet, and I'm sure many people live there because of this, but to others it's a very negative trait.   House prices are also quite low compared to neighbouring city T칮nsberg, and therefore it is more attractive to people with a lower income. Horten is very close to 칒stfold because of the ferry, and I think some people view hortensere as they view 칮stfoldinger: a little ""harry"" (if you are not familiar with this term I'm sorry I have no quick way to explain it).   However, Horten is somewhat of a technology hub in Vestfold, and there are many job opportunities there for engineers. The only university/college in Vestfold is located in Horten kommune, so many students live in/around Horten.  Horten kommune has some really beautiful sites, typically in the summer. 칀sg친rdstrand, Borrehaugene or just a walk along Karljohansvern is a must for anyone staying in Horten."

Norway,3brke1,Willian_II,7,Wed Jul 1 16:04:23 2015 UTC,I know nothing about the costs of towing but I'm not surprised if it is in that ballpark. I would recommend you to tell the towing firm to take the car to the nearest car wrecker. There might be a salvage reimbursement that will cover most of the costs of towing. Then you catch a bus to Finland/Helsinki and enjoy the trip rather than think of the lost money. buying an old car is a gamble after all.
Norway,3brke1,ixian_probe,3,Wed Jul 1 16:42:33 2015 UTC,"Unless the engine is overheating or leaking coolant, it's definitely not radiator related. Running batteries, especially old ones, all the way to dead-ness is kinda harmful and may kill them completely. And if you have an inefficient (or dead) alternator, the charge it produces will not be enough to keep the car going without a battery. And since it stalled when idling it seems like it's not doing it's job very well.  First thing I would do: Find a multimeter/voltmeter to troubleshoot the alternator. All you need to do is measure the voltage on the battery while idling. It should be 14ish volts. Any lower and you have an alternator problem. If it proves to be good you should try to find a new battery for it, they can cost from 500 to 1500kr depending on the brand and store. That should get you on your way."
Norway,3brke1,EmptyHeadedAnimal,3,Wed Jul 1 23:10:18 2015 UTC,"Also if you just got jump - started, you don't let the car idle. You need to drive around for at least 20 minutes to get the battery charged up."
Norway,3brke1,Antonskarp,2,Wed Jul 1 23:22:36 2015 UTC,buy new battery? It's most likely just your battery that is dead. It is not common for a radiator to fail because you forget to turn of your lights.

Norway,3bnwqz,jasonofcompsci,4,Wed Jul 1 00:53:32 2015 UTC,"My family lived in Longyearbyen, Svalbard for a year. This was twelve years ago, so take anything I say with a grain of salt.  Summers are rather short up there, so kicking a ball around won't be a year-round hobby, however if you are the type of person to enjoy snowmobiles, this is the perfect place.  Prices are wonky up there. Anything canned is sold very cheap, I believe they take no sales tax, however any fresh food (milk, vegetables) are hella expensive... Rule of thumb is that things that can spend a few weeks on a boat are cheap, things that need to be flown in to not spoil are pricey.  Internet sucked when I was there. I hope they have improved that since.  Longyearbyen has really dirty drinking water, and needs to rinse it really well before it goes out to homes. What comes out of the kitchen sink is the cleanest water I've ever tasted. That's not good, it tastes nothing at all and is actually painful to swallow.  Alcohol is cheap, though. They have quotas on alcohol, just to curb to being the go-to-drink.  Do you shoot a gun? My mother didn't...until she moved to Svalbard. When polar bears may wander into town, everybody needs to be able to shoot a gun (and carry rifles). This was sort of hilarious when Hillary Clinton, then engaged in a primary election, visited Svalbard, and Secret Service had a grand old time escorting her around a town when everyone is required to carry weapons.

Norway,3bpgsx,Spsteam,6,Wed Jul 1 02:36:24 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a cool trip. Google suggests taking Rv7, and I agree. As my family has a cabin in Hemsedal, which is on your way, I know that part of the route pretty well. After leaving Oslo I suggest planing for a meal and break at Sokna. Their Rustad Cafe to the right of the road is awesome.  Your previous post-history on reddit suggests you are from California, I do not know how much experience you have with Norwegian roads, but I will assume your experience is low, if that is wrong and I am bothering you with too much details on some parts then excuse me.  The Norwegian roads are narrow and winding. There are few places to overtake safely and lots of trucks. If you pay attention to the paint in the middle of the road it will give you hints of when you could get ready to overtake someone, and when not to. I am unfamiliar with american roads, so I dont know if this is usual or not. If there is no paint in the middle of the road, the road is too narrow for it.  On the way you will pass Fl친, they have a bear park. With bears, lynx and moose. Feeding of the bears 12:00, 14:00, 15:00 and 16:00. (their website is shait, but looks good, had to call them to get those times)  This is the elevation profile of the suggested route. (Roughly, some of the odd spikes might be me miss-placing a click or there might be a tunnel there). As you can see, you will be driving over a mountain. It will start climbing after Gol, but get fun after Hemsedal. You might see snow up there still. Make sure to not me low on fuel when passing Hemsedal, make sure you can reach L칝rdal comfortably. (Climbing demands fuel)  The part I want to make sure you understand is the steep decline down to L칝rdal. You will feel like using your brake pedal, if you have not done this alot previously. That is a great way to royally fekk up your new car. The brakes will either critically overheat or glace over making them much less effective. The proper way is to use low gears. The RPM will go pretty high, and it will sound like its having a bad day, just use the brakes to keep it out of the red and it should be fine. This is the number one mistake foreigners driving over the mountains does.  Also, the road down the mountain has some hairpin turns, it there is a bus or truck on the inside track they might need to enter the other lane to get past the turn. Just find a way to drive slow and keep distance.  Now Solvorn, thats really something, when it comes to nature. This is some prime stuff. I would suggest driving via L칝rdal, through the worlds longest road tunnel, to Aurland (They have an extreme viewpoint you should check out), Fl친m (take the train), Undredal (a hidden gem a tiny bit out of the way), Gudvangen and Stalheim (the view from the hotel is amazing). The ferry from Gudvangen to Aurland is very nice.  I would not prioritize Bergen, if not to see the city itself. You are already at the heart of the best nature. The only way to step it up would be to consider Geiranger, but I am not sure that fits with your plans.  Hope this was helpful, let me know if there is anything else I can answer for you."
Norway,3bpgsx,atluxity,1 point,Wed Jul 1 09:47:39 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for the detailed reply.  This is all great information and very useful.  The more I think about it, the more I'm inclined forego a Bergen visit.  It's just too ambitious for the time we have.    I am getting more and more excited about Solvorn and the areas around it.  I'll be bringing quite a bit of camera gear with me with the hopes of getting one or two really nice long exposure night shots of the mountains and fjord.  Maybe print out one or two posters for my office.  I'll be sure to post there here too if I get a good one.  I'll also heed your advice on driving and set aside enough time for the slow and windy roads.  I know here in the states it's not at usual to plan a day's driving trip from here in San Francisco to San Diego -- 800 km+ in a day.  Of course, you can do the vast majority of the driving at 140 kph. So, mountain driving in Norway will be at a bit of a slower pace.  Not a problem.  I'll be in vacation mode and likely pulling over and stopping quite a bit to take in the sights."

And I'd consider that easy enough if you have good shoes, good sense of the land and something to guide you with.   Not meant to berate and it's perfectly legit to have such an experience as you have, but it's just difficult to 'rank' trips like that if ones expectation is flat or built out paths, as that'd be by Norwegian standards more like an easy day trip than an actual mountain hike.    A difficult mountain hike requires specialized gear, mountaineering skills or packed for camping, etc."

Finally, another country I can relate to on stuff like this! :) We always get tourists completely out of their depth, who think they can buy food at the top of mountains or whatever. (Pro tip: you can't. Ever.)

No marked trails."

Norway,3bjgru,RalphNLD,5,Wed Jul 1 11:43:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, as a Dutchman regularly visiting your country, I often have explain to people that the translation isn't quite one-to-one with the rest of the world.  Basically:  ""lovely family walk"" = probably survivable, but be careful  ""easy hike"" = only small possibility of death  ""moderately easy hike"" = try not to fall off the cliff  ""advanced"" = if you weren't born with Norwegian hands and feet you better bring some safety gear  ""difficult"" = sherpas/Norwegians only  And even then it is important to get up-to-date knowledge from the locals. We once went out for a ""lovely family walk"", according to the brochures at least, with some children and one of the adults nearly fell into a ravine. The first Norwegians we encountered on that trip very politely asked us what the hell we were doing on that trail with those young kids."
Norway,3bjgru,RalphNLD,12,Wed Jul 1 21:45:10 2015 UTC,"There was never a place where I could place my foot flat on the ground, always a stone, water, a rock - something.   That's normal. If you went mountain hiking in Norway it would be the same thing. Fog happens, too.  Norwegians just have different expectations about this. My uncle in Sogndal got friendly with this English woman over a shared interest in birdwatching. So he took her birdwatching and found that the woman couldn't walk on a normal path. She just wasn't able to do it. You should have seen his face when he told me he realized that she'd only seen birds in parks.  My wife saved this German woman on Hardangervidda. The woman's problem was it started raining and she hadn't anticipated that at 1000 meters above sea level that could get really, really, really cold. And then when you're a couple hours walking away from the nearest shelter, well, that's actually a serious problem. She could easily have died."

Norway,3bhr12,Krnshh,2,Mon Jun 29 09:18:16 2015 UTC,"I'll give you some answers to the best of my ability.   Your current weeks of vacation is an issue between yourself and your current employer, so you should try to resolve them before leaving the company. Usually this means that you shorten the time before leaving the company. Ex. You were supposed to leave the company 30. september, but since you have 4 weeks left of vacation you leave the 2. september. As an alternative you will continue to get paid after leaving your employer for as long as your vacation runs. So if you have 5 weeks left you get paid for 5 weeks more after departure. As per Ferielovens 춶5 and you joining the 1. of October you have a right to 6 days of vacation. My recomendation is to talk to your new employer about the possibility of working extra at other times to cover those last 4 days, however this is a matter of negoitiation and not a right. As per As per Ferielovens 춶5 and you joining the 1. of October you have a right to 6 days of vacation in 2015. If you had joined the 30. september you would have had rights for the full 5 weeks."

Norway,3bhr12,tatatita,1 point,Mon Jun 29 10:59:14 2015 UTC,"As others have mentioned, there are rules governing what your rights are etc, but tbh, the best thing to do is just discuss it with your future employer.

From there you can take a boat to Memurubu, and then hike back to Gjendesheim.  Note that this is probably the most touristic hike in all of Jotunheimen - sure, it's a nice hike, but don't expect much more peace, quiet or connection with nature than you would in Disneyland (or on the south rim of Grand Canyon). It all depends what you are looking for.  By the way, you seem to have a LOT lined up there, how much time do you have? Norway is big, and the mountains make it so that the roads and rails aren't all that great, especially if you're not traveling on one of the main routes   Oslo <-> Kristiansand <-> Stavanger (S칮rlandet) Oslo <-> Bergen (Hallingdal) Oslo <-> Trondheim (Gudbrandsdalen)   but jumping between them. I would recommend plotting these three routes on a map, and try to not jump too much between them - places that look close may actually be separated by a big mountain and hard to get between. Along these routes, there are plenty of buses and trains."
Norway,3bagoo,kyrsjo,1 point,Sat Jun 27 10:42:35 2015 UTC,Thanks for the help!  I have a few days shy of three weeks.   I guess I should have been more specific about Besseggen. I'll be in the Odda/Eidfjord area and I am having trouble knowing how to get from there to the Memurubu/Gjendesheim area. I can't even really figure out if this connection is possible. I want to say it would be since they are both popular tourist destinations. I find it difficult to know which towns will connect to other towns.  I know that doing popular hikes can be very busy. I'm going on a solo trip so the crowd is a bit of comfort for me since I'll be alone otherwise. Good mention though in case someone else is looking for this information.
Norway,3bagoo,kyrsjo,2,Sat Jun 27 10:55:53 2015 UTC,"Without checking, I would think the easiest way to get from Odda to Gjendesheim would either be to go to Bergen, get a train to Gol, get a bus to Fagernes, and from there get a bus to Gjendesheim. Or it may be easier to go to Oslo (somehow) and then go to Fagernes -> Gjendesheim. It is a long and inconvenient trip (you are crossing several valleys, look at the google maps of the country - the main roads (those called E<something> follows the valleys, I would probably try to break it in two and stay overnight in either Bergen or Oslo.  By the way, do you know about Turistforeningen? http://english.turistforeningen.no/ They run a lot of cabins (many of them essentially hotels) in the mountains. If you plan to go hiking, you should consider a membership with them, it may save you a lot of money, and also get you rebates for other things like buses.  Another nice page is ut.no: http://ut.no/tur/2.4957/ It's in Norwegian, but the google translate (language menu, upper left corner) to English is OK."
Norway,3bagoo,kyrsjo,2,Sat Jun 27 11:45:56 2015 UTC,"Just to repeat myself: When planning your trip, look at the map, and locate the main roads and rails. As long as you stay on them, it is easy to get around. Stray for them, and it might be more efficient to detour via Oslo, even if it 100s of extra km. Try to sort your destinations accordingly...

I would dare to say that nearly ever single Norwegian rock/punk/pop band afterwards were in some ways influenced or inspired by them.  I really love some of their albums, especially Splitter Pine and Pstereo which are both classic records in Norwegian music history. Another great album is Ludium which contains the saddest song I know; Tyven, Tyven. The singer's daughter died very young and this was written to commemorate her, the lyrics are absolutely wonderful.  This is my personal opinion but if DumDum Boys could have made the same music but in English they would have become much much bigger than A-ha. In the context of late 80s rock/pop music they would have fitted right in, they'd probably have become a gigantic band :)  All their albums are available on spotify: https://open.spotify.com/artist/4Eqk6wvSaia7pwOzPaqEQv"

Norway,3b8awx,csstt,27,Fri Jun 26 19:51:18 2015 UTC,They can't even ask you to quit unless they are offering a severance package. They are asking you to quit because it would be even more illegal to fire you.
Norway,3b8awx,Antonskarp,22,Fri Jun 26 21:05:13 2015 UTC,"First of all, don't quit! Quitting leaves you with almost no rights.   Relevant parts of the law:   http://www.arbeidstilsynet.no/binfil/download2.php?tid=92156 (English) https://lovdata.no/dokument/NL/lov/2005-06-17-62/KAPITTEL_15 (Norwegian)   The most important part is here:   Section 15-7. Protection against unfair dismissal  (1) Employees may not be dismissed unless this is objectively justified on the basis of circumstances relating to the undertaking, the employer or the employee.  (2) Dismissal due to curtailed operations or rationalisation measures is not objectively justified if the employer has other suitable work in the undertaking to offer the employee. When deciding whether a dismissal is objectively justified by curtailed operations or rationalisation measures, the needs of the undertaking shall be weighed against the disadvantage caused by the dismissal for the individual employee.  (3) Dismissal owing to an employer뗩 actual or planned contracting out of the undertaking뗩 ordinary operations to a third party is not objectively justified unless it is absolutely essential in order to maintain the continued operation of the undertaking.   If they fire you, and you believe the reason isn't in line with Section 15-7, you should immediately dispute the justification of the dismissal, which is stated in this part:   Section 15-11. The employee뗩 right to remain in his post  (1) In the event of a dispute concerning whether an employment relationship has been legally terminated pursuant to the provisions of section 15-7, an employee may remain in the post as long as negotiations are in progress pursuant to section 17-3.   If your company has any union reps, talk to them even if you aren't organized (yet) and ask for pointers.  Good luck!"

Right-to-work laws do not aim to provide general guarantee of employment to people seeking work, but rather are a government regulation of the contractual agreements between employers and labor unions that prevents them from excluding non-union workers,  or requiring employees to pay a fee to unions that have negotiated the labor contract all the employees work under.

Norway,3b8awx,autowikibot,2,Sat Jun 27 02:24:45 2015 UTC,"In Singapore, it's very common to hire programmers as a contractor. Once the skill is verified, usually the contract will be upgraded to a regular employee. Otherwise, the employer simply doesn't renew the contract. Since the risk of hiring the wrong people with this model is quite low and measurable, it's actually good for the applicants because the hiring process becomes less complicated and people tend to get a second chance. The employers usually don't ask too much about past employers, and they are not so paranoid. References are usually not needed to apply for a job."

Norway,3an7c5,frembuild,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:52:51 2015 UTC,"Some people even if they can find the answears easly wants to ask a place where norwegians are since it gives extra comfort kinda, it makes your more sure that the thing you are going to do is funn or something like that.  But it should also be expectet that they do some before reaserch ofcourse"
Norway,3an7c5,potetman123,2,Thu Jun 25 01:38:01 2015 UTC,Thank you :)
Norway,3an7c5,Sabo88,-1,Sat Jun 27 01:18:58 2015 UTC,"Well I am travelling to Norway next month for pure pleasure and now after reading this post (My very first forray into this sub reddit) I actually am afraid to ask you guys anything about your country.  Rough start, you're coming off as smug and I hope this isn't the case when I arrive with more less zero knowledge about your history.   I know you speak Norwegian, speak great English and have nice things to see.   Now I'm scared you will all treat me like crap because I haven't spent months studying about you and you will all assume I'm American.  Signed, Canadian who booked round trip out of Oslo."
Norway,3an7c5,Sabo88,-1,Mon Jun 22 11:34:22 2015 UTC,You guys aren't sounding very friendly at all....  I hope Norway isn't the Quebec of Scandanavia.....
Norway,3an7c5,oxbo1690,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:51:34 2015 UTC,"Ontario? You sound like an Ontarion. The point is in this subreddit, use the search function or do some rudimentary research before you ask a question. Its tiring the amount of times the same questions gets asked here. As well, this subreddit is a community of 11000. Not a reflection of all Norwegians."
Norway,3an7c5,Sabo88,-2,Wed Jun 24 10:04:48 2015 UTC,"No I'm not.   May I ask what it was I typed that made me ""sound"" Ontarion?"
Norway,3an7c5,oxbo1690,2,Wed Jun 24 10:34:11 2015 UTC,Albertan then? Or oil patch kid?
Norway,3an7c5,frembuild,2,Wed Jun 24 10:58:35 2015 UTC,"Americans are actually pretty good about trying to know Norwegian culture and language, since many of those who visit have ancestors from here."
Norway,3amuoh,bradleyb5155,3,Sun Jun 21 19:52:48 2015 UTC,Rygge bus is pretty convenient as it coincides with flight times.
Norway,3amuoh,monkeyscr0tum,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:44:33 2015 UTC,What it the website? Or name? Thanks

Norway,3amuoh,hardcore_fish,2,Mon Jun 22 15:23:09 2015 UTC,"I'd say take the train to Rygge and get in the shuttle bus to the airport from there. Can't remember the times or faires at the moment, but there should be information about it on the airport website."
Norway,3amuoh,hardcore_fish,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:04:16 2015 UTC,From where?
Norway,3amuoh,Fridom,0,Sun Jun 21 20:23:50 2015 UTC,Do they leave from Oslo S?
Norway,3amuoh,z4ffo,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:28:34 2015 UTC,The trains leave from Oslo S and the busses from Oslo bus terminal next to Oslo S.

The bus terminal is connected to Oslo S by a bridge. Just ask people there, they will point you in the right direction."
Norway,3amov2,wellio7,8,Sun Jun 21 19:02:01 2015 UTC,Coop Obs https://coop.no/obs-hypermarked/
Norway,3amov2,akh,3,Sun Jun 21 19:11:05 2015 UTC,"In Denmark this is called Isenkram stores and it's a concept I'm going to miss a lot when I move back home.  Anyway. I'd say that Obs hypermarked is a good, if not the best, place to start. Then there is always Europris as well. Coop Obs sells stuff like raincoats, thermos, lawn mowers, laundry baskets, socks, food, kitchen stuff, and so on and so fourth.  You can go on their site https://coop.no/obs-hypermarked/ which has a map of all the stores."
Norway,3amov2,Sonols,3,Sun Jun 21 19:09:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  And forgive me for asking the perhaps obvious question, but...is there a place in Bergen to buy a good raincoat that doesn't cost thousands of kroner (and isn't as ugly as sin)?"
Norway,3amov2,sanchez_,4,Sun Jun 21 19:38:09 2015 UTC,"I live in Bergen. You could try ""Spar Kj칮p"", a cheap store that sells clothes and a bunch of other things too. They have one really close to Bryggen and Fisketorget, the great landmarks we have by the docks. It's located at the start of the street ""Strandgaten""."
Norway,3amov2,Sonols,2,Sun Jun 21 20:48:04 2015 UTC,Thank you!
Norway,3amov2,turkeysrule,2,Sun Jun 21 21:50:27 2015 UTC,"Have you ever seen a pretty raincoat?  Anyway. H&M, the two places I mentioned and XXL."
Norway,3amov2,turkeysrule,2,Sun Jun 21 19:44:16 2015 UTC,"Actually, yes - some raincoats are more stylish than others.  I always look at H&M - but they don't seem to have anything that's even vaguely waterproof.  But I'll definitely look at the other two, and XXL.  Thanks again."
Norway,3amov2,turkeysrule,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:50:12 2015 UTC,"Oh, and speaking of ugly:  http://www.europris.no/klaer-sko/regntoy/regnponcho  But can't beat the price :)"
Norway,3amov2,hardcore_fish,2,Sun Jun 21 22:02:06 2015 UTC,"Protip: Usually sets are cheaper than just the jacket.  For example, here's a set for ladies and here's one for men.  And here's a unisex one for good measure.  Sidenote, Stormberg usually has great deals on their clothes. There's a shop in Xhibition."
Norway,3amov2,mortiferus,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:06:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  I rather like this coat (http://www.stormberg.com/no/herre/jakker/dis-jakke-hoved.html#14306), but it's a bit more than I want to spend.  (And by the way - why can't I find how to make a hyperlink on reddit??!)"
