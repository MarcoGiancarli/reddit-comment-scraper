Helldivers,3e57t8,They_call_me_OP,2,Wed Jul 22 03:03:27 2015 UTC,Now hold on. Each mission earns influence. However it is only uploaded to the yellow influence bar on completion of the last mission of a planet. You can do 2/3 missions offline but the third and final mjst be completed online to count the whole planets influence.
Helldivers,3e57t8,Wiktorjor2001,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:33:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm really confused about this. So the game can sort of be ""completed"" by completing every mission leading to maxed out influence bar, on condition that the final mission be completed online to max it out? What if you don't complete those online?"
Helldivers,3e57t8,InSanitangles,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:56:22 2015 UTC,"Nothing happens if you complete then offline -  ""progress wasn't uploaded to super earth command"". Side note: If you play offline, you can't access defense missions and final assault missions, not sure about bosses."
Helldivers,3e57t8,Wiktorjor2001,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:05:11 2015 UTC,However if you enter a defence or final assault mission online then go offline you can still do the missions (and get double xp) as long as you don't enter the galaxy map.

Helldivers,3dyasm,Mewwy_Quizzmas,5,Mon Jul 20 15:02:11 2015 UTC,Limited budget = Reinforcement Bundles. Buy the one you most like or you think it's most useful I think both have strong and weak points so it's on you.
Helldivers,3dyasm,murdok1691,3,Mon Jul 20 16:09:11 2015 UTC,The demolisher c4 packs are probably the best item for the price. It's a really good anti tank weapon. Not absolutely necessary but really really nice to have.
Helldivers,3dyasm,PizzaSnake,2,Mon Jul 20 16:56:01 2015 UTC,"I definitely would go with one of the two reinforcement packs.  Both are outstanding.  The Hazard Ops items are among my favorites in the game, and the demolisher is extremely useful, so I'd suggest the Reinforcement pack #2 that includes those.  But the Guard Dog and Commando are both among my favorite items in the game as well, so the first pack is very good as well.  Ideally I'd pick up both of those, if your budget stretches that far, but either one will give you a lot to work with."
Helldivers,3dyasm,jophur,2,Mon Jul 20 18:58:51 2015 UTC,"I wrote a breakdown of my opinions here.  My specific opinions have drifted a bit (I like the entrenched pack more than I used to, mainly) but this is still basically an accurate reflection of my recs. https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/3d0alc/hi_fellow_helldivers_%C3%AD_have_a_question_about_dlc/ct94gfx?context=3"
Helldivers,3dyasm,jophur,2,Mon Jul 20 19:20:18 2015 UTC,"100 hours player here.  Specialist and demolitionist for tanto and Rec-6 (C4 bricks). Both the most op weapons in game.  Tanto probably has the biggest sustain damage output for primary weapon(maybe only breaker has more) while don't require ammo and reloads... totally balanced. Ah also it can be used while carrying boxes/shells and allows to move faster while shooting comparing to other 2-hand primaries.  REC-6 is the best anti-tank weapon if you are playing alone or on public (without friends). Railgun strike has quite long deployment time, recoilless rifle has huge reload time, making you vulnerable. REC-6 also can be used like grenade to kill groups of enemies. There only 1 enemy type (it is not even heavy armoured enemy) in the game that cant be killed with 1 brick of REC-6(you have 5 each 120 seconds) and 4 others that usually takes 2, but with superior placement still can be killed with 1.  Items in other DLCs mostly just for fun. They bring new experience and joy, but if you are aiming for the best performance and efficiency  you will hardly use them."
Helldivers,3dyasm,Rataraxia,2,Mon Jul 20 23:32:26 2015 UTC,"I can also recommend rec-6. Best antitank weapon when playing with randoms. I usually equip myself with lift, 2x rec-6 and a mech."
Helldivers,3dyasm,paasalon,2,Tue Jul 21 05:39:05 2015 UTC,"You can read all you want about the different DLC's  that are available. But if you really want to know what they're like,jump on YouTube to check them. No amount of words can describe them as well as seeing them in action before you throw your cash at the screen. If you can stretch the budget,I recommend getting all of them."
Helldivers,3dyasm,AGRO-SMASHA,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:21:56 2015 UTC,"If you have a mic, you might also look for someone who has them and ask to try them out. You can't sample primary weapons, but a teammate can drop a DLC backpack or heavy weapon for your use, even if you don't own that DLC."
Helldivers,3dyasm,rdhight,2,Tue Jul 21 05:43:20 2015 UTC,"Depends on your playstyle -- you could get the two DLC mechs if that's your thing.  For the best combination of usefulness and uniqueness, I recommend going the three individual packs route: Ranger for UAV, Support for Guard Dog, Hazard Ops for Paragon and Avenger.  They're not the absolute most powerful DLC things (that's probably Sickle and REC-6), but they all have unique capabilities."
Helldivers,3dyasm,rdhight,2,Mon Jul 20 17:19:45 2015 UTC,I thought the support pack got the angel and the defender with the guard dog.
Helldivers,3dyasm,ConnerVonHerd,2,Mon Jul 20 21:39:33 2015 UTC,"It does yeah. Angel is in the support pack and Guard Dog is in the Defender pack.  Of the two, I'd rather have the support pack as it gives you the Sickle, the Angel, and a really nice all white attire."
Helldivers,3dyasm,TheLethalDiva,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:16:42 2015 UTC,Totally agree but the guard dog is nice if your going in solo and there are a few bugs creeping up behind you.

Helldivers,3dyasm,TheLethalDiva,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:53:30 2015 UTC,Thanks everyone! I have tried or seen all of the equipment in game. After adding everything together i'm leaning towards reinforcement bundle #2. Partly because the avenger seems like fun (haven't tried it) but mostly because the pack includes the Rec-6. I find it sometimes difficult to play high level PUG's without it.    See you guys on the battlefield!
Helldivers,3dyasm,jophur,2,Tue Jul 21 12:03:45 2015 UTC,"Sweet.  Don't bother with the Avenger vs. Illuminate, and it's not great vs. Cyborgs, but it'll absolutely devour Bugs."
Helldivers,3dyasm,Drocktimus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:54:12 2015 UTC,Demo pack.   Support pack.  Vehicles pack if you play with friends regularly.   Ranger pack (if someone you play with doesn't already have the UAV that scouts science samples)

Helldivers,3dxit1,murdok1691,2,Mon Jul 20 10:25:32 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a nice pack. I like the theme. A few things, though: what would be the benefit of using the MG vehicle compared to the HAV or the APC (that noone uses anyway)?   And what is the benefit of using a manual minigun turret? The thing with the manual anti tank turret is that it fills a slot: anti tank turrets. Prior to the manual turret there were no stationary anti-tank turrets, while there are already MG-turrets. What would be the benefit of it, to make you trade your mobility, your ability to throw strats balls and grenades as well as firing your primary and secondary weapons? While MG is cool and everything, i don't see anyone using it over the automatic turrets, even if it upgrades to two guns.  I like the handheld MG though :)"
Helldivers,3dxit1,Mewwy_Quizzmas,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:32:08 2015 UTC,"I see a lot of people using the HAV and APC, I do, sometimes for helldives with a Rep-80 and you only left the tank beacuse you ran out of ammo. The idea it's to have another ""tank"" type vehicle, with a minigun, to add more variety, I think it could be funny, having a tank around you shooting.  Manual turret, you have a twin machine gun, with a lot firepower it serves to protect objectives or the arrival of the shuttle, but you have to control that shot, also comes well to avoid accidents from the automatic turrets, deaths and objectives.  Machinegun, it's a very common weapon in other games, well balanced could fit well in the metageme. I also like it.  Thanks for sharing your thoughs :)"
Helldivers,3dxit1,Mewwy_Quizzmas,2,Mon Jul 20 14:22:02 2015 UTC,"No problems, it's a fun discussion :)   The MG tank would be funny and att variety, yes. But why would you want to pick it over the bastion or the HAV? The way i see it, noone ever picks the APC (unless that's the only vehicle you've unlocked) because the HAV does everything the APC does, only better. I personally think they should buff the APC somehow, even if i can't think of how. But back to you MG tank: IMO it has to have a reason to exist other than adding variety.   I like your point of a manual MG turret makes avoiding accidentals easier. That's a valid point, even if i personally don't think it makes up for its disadvantages compared to using automatic turrets"
Helldivers,3dxit1,They_call_me_OP,2,Mon Jul 20 14:51:41 2015 UTC,"Im not much a vehicle guy myself. The MG turret excites me because the automatic turret is waaaay too accident prone. I never bring them due to that.   I love the idae of a big wieldable chaingun. However, I would never use it if it permanently slowed me. Plus dropping it everytime would get tiresome and probably weird to program. Instead I say, HUGE ammo capacity, one time call down to balance firepower. When you fire, you cant move. Semi wide spread. No need for reload."
Helldivers,3dxit1,Mewwy_Quizzmas,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:09:29 2015 UTC,"Good points, any combination that is balanced will be fine.  But since in real life it's two handed, the only way to change weapons (if you want) it's to drop it.  Thanks :)"
Helldivers,3dxit1,D_Luniz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:26:48 2015 UTC,"Well, most of the primary and secondary weapons are two-handed but just go on your back when not used (MG, RR, sniffer, LAS-98 and so on).  I wouldn't mind a weapon you had to drop while not using, though. You'd have to make a decision: lose the minigun temporarily when you have to use another weapon, or run with the minigun and accept that it doesn't do the trick at the moment."

For starts the game is only 20$ and the DLC is for only those who want to support them, you don't need any of it to play the game, all the other new stuff like planets and boss battles they have added to renew the excitement is free. Yes every update has brought bugs and glitches but if you noticed anything on this forum they are collecting data from US PLAYERS to fix as soon as possible. Not only that but they are also listening to our concerns and desires on what we want added (boss battles and a bike were big demands btw) as well as tuning the system to break stalemates with enemies. When you think about all that they have done and realize that it's only a single development team doing ALL of this you can appreciate their work and be a little more understanding, they know things are broke and they are gonna fix them.

They tend to be stronger than their primary weapon counterparts, and they can help round out or balance your loadout.  Compare that to vehicles and mechs, which despite the advantage they bring in you in the short term, are basically finite resources. When your mech or vehicle blows up, its gone for good. With secondary weapons and backpack items you can always go back and retrieve them if you want to."
Helldivers,3dvgw6,TheLethalDiva,3,Mon Jul 20 04:39:13 2015 UTC,"Okie dokie, glad you're enjoying the game!  1) special weapons:  Tox sprayer is phenomenal against bugs. A little bit goes a long way as does the flamethrower, through the tox is better IMHO because it also slows enemies.  You already mentioned recoiless which makes sense.   The 4x rocket launcher is great against illuminate as they don't have any heavy armor. As a result you don't need a clear line of sight to take out council members.  The demo charge is one of the better stratagems in the game. Unlimited call downs, 5 charges, kills anything in one hit (if placed correctly).  Eat-17 is great for high end missions if you don't know who you are dropping in with especially combined with stratagem priority as you don't need/lose a back pack.  2) back packs are amazing especially shield (negates status effects and prevents dogs from charging) and the jet packs (get you the hell out of dodge). Experiment with the others as they are all useful.  3) vehicles are their own thing. Ironically not used too often in higher game play. The vanilla mech is pretty solid against all enemies which is also it's downfall because the other two specialize better.  4) initial research you should focus on yellow stratagems (reinforcement/nukes) your pistol and ammo supply as you will always use those/ have a need for them. After that go crazy with your personal play style. (Also the breaker holds its value, it's worth the upgrade).  5) enjoy it! It's one of the best games in a long time! Have fun and don't ever take anything too seriously :D  Edit: words"
Helldivers,3dvgw6,CaptainTruelove,2,Sun Jul 19 22:15:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the long and thought out response. I figure vehicles are not popular because you cant get ""hands on"" for objectives and such but I plan to use them forever and do my best to hop out when needed."
Helldivers,3dvgw6,CaptainTruelove,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:36:13 2015 UTC,On helldives (lvl 12 planets) you run out of ammo too quick and they slow you down too much. Better to be quick and have portable anti armor (usually). They are definitely good for evac. The more you play the better you'll see how everything fits as well as come up with your own play style/strategies.
Helldivers,3dvgw6,TheLethalDiva,2,Mon Jul 20 01:48:29 2015 UTC,"You should almost never run out of ammo with a vehicle. That only generally happens if the diver in the back controlling the main turret doesn't know what he's doing and wastes ammo. For the most part you can run over the majority of the enemies. So as long as you have a Rep-80 and no new players drop on you, you should be able to ride that one vehicle all the way though the Helldive (if you want to). As for extractions, I think mechs are better suited for that, over vehicles, although it doesn't really matter.  The reason vehicles aren't always popular IMO, is the fact that if you always run a vehicle heavy load-out, we all have to be inside the vehicle. You have 3 other players with load-outs their wanting to play for that mission, but they can't. Because now instead, their forced to sit in your vehicle. Sometimes its cool as variety is a great thing about this game, but it can be annoying at times as well as many players in this game like to run and gun on foot.  But hey, if you love the vehicles, play the vehicles, nothing wrong with that."
Helldivers,3dvgw6,jophur,2,Mon Jul 20 04:15:46 2015 UTC,"I agree with all of this.  Vehicles with a bunch of coordinating friends can be rad, because I can focus my build on being the turret gunner, say, with a REP-80 and a bunch of stuff to fortify defense / extract points.  But if I showed up armed to the teeth with support weapons and red strategems, I don't really want to be side-gunner on your APC.  In addition to this point, if you want to bring a 4-diver vehicle, you better know how to drive that thing really well, because if we eat a hellpod or you drive off a cliff, that's the game, in one fell swoop.  So, yeah, I'd advise those only once you've gotten to know a group of divers and can discuss it explicitly.  But it's your loadout!"
Helldivers,3dvgw6,swagohod,2,Mon Jul 20 19:53:31 2015 UTC,"Level up your UAV first because there's literally no comparison between just finding science by accident and systematically hunting it all down.  As for support weapons vs vehicles vs mechs: your support weapon is vehicle-level firepower, but you can keep it supplied for ammo through the entire mission and it can't be blown up. Vehicles are just a ticking clock, and the rest of the team usually has to hold back with the really blow-stuff-up strats to avoid wiping out a teammate's ride by accident."
Helldivers,3dvgw6,jdotp,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:26:19 2015 UTC,"As you get into higher level missions where your guns don't seem to be working against the giant bugs or cyborg tanks, I like maxxing out the orbital rail strike one.    Mechs are great for early game, as are turrets.  Throw up a turret and get in your mech so it doesn't kill you (they are worse than George RR Martin at killing people).  Personally, I almost never use my pistol.    Try to unlock the scythe/sickle and other laser weapon, they are really life savers...you get to save your slot usually used for ammo.  Perhaps more important is to look at what you play the most, and look at loadouts people like for that class...bugs, cyborgs, illuminate.  Then, look for missions which offer the strategems you want as rewards."
Helldivers,3dvgw6,TheLethalDiva,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:40:06 2015 UTC,"Throwing up a mech and a turret at the same time is not a great idea (unless its a Tesla). As the turret may not outright kill you, but it will more than likely be a nuisance to you. Since you can't dodge its fire while you're in a mech. You'd be much better off generally, using one and then the other as opposed to both at the same time."
Helldivers,3dvgw6,jdotp,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:52:54 2015 UTC,"In a mech, you aren't immediately mowed down by turrets.  In early levels, that was what happened to me non-stop when I threw down a turret.  Being in a mech at least gives you a bunch of time before it actually kills you.  That's my reasoning."
Helldivers,3dvgw6,TheLethalDiva,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:02:47 2015 UTC,"I get what you're saying. I'm just saying its not needed to throw both at the same time. Just because the turret doesn't outright kill me, doesn't mean I want it shooting and damaging my mech, either. If you're running mechs, I would try running stratagem priority and static field instead (just one example). The static field will hold enemies at bay, and while you're inside the mech you'll be able to walk through the static freely, like its not even there. It has much more synergy with your mech, than a turret does."
Helldivers,3dvgw6,jophur,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:19:21 2015 UTC,"Welcome!  I'll give my take on these points, though there are other good answers on here already:  The support weapons are less straightforward to use well than the primaries, but they each serve a very valuable role when used optimally.  The Avenger is in basically every Bugs run I do, and the Commando for the rest.  I typically bring two of my support, in fact, because I'm that dependent on it.  Basically my experience with this game has been: If I think something is trash, I probably just don't understand it yet.  I hated the Avenger.  Then I saw @robothorror eating face with it and it's now my favorite item.  It wrecks ALL BUGS.  Half a tank from that thing into a bug tank and you just watch it stumble around and succumb.  Immensely satisfying.  And while it's killing it slows things down for you to retreat or just improve positioning.  If only it worked as well against Borgs/Squids I'd never put it down.  Commando takes a long time to reload, like the RR, and doesn't do as much damage per shot, but nothing other than the Shredder outclasses the RR on that front.  And the Commando fires EIGHT HEAT SEEKING ROCKETS per reload.  If you hit from the right angle two missiles take out basically anything the game can throw at you (not counting bosses).  It's more of a skill weapon than it initially seems, because it can be easily used wrong.  But once you get the hang of when to use it, when to reload it, and how to aim it for maximum effect, it's a life-saver.  And so on for other supports.  Used correctly, they're wrecking balls.  I'm not a fan of vehicles, because I mostly play with randoms.  A well coordinated team that knows e.g. when to shoot and when to sit there patiently and trust the driver, though, can go to town with them.  The new 2-seat tank is a powerhouse when used well.  The chaingun mech is sort of the middle-ground between the Obsidian and the Lumberer.  The limited rockets are an issue, but the Lumberer runs out of anti-personnel fuel VERY quickly and the Obsidian is worthless against tanks.   I think the chaingun model is probably the best vs cyborgs, personally.  Obsidian dominates Illuminate and the Lumberer wrecks bugs.  Chaingun model is the Jack-of-all-Trades.  And it's important to remember that mechs can chuck out red strategems.  If you sit inside that armor, especially with a teammate manning a REP-80, and use strafing run/railcannon strike all day, you're an eternal death machine.  You have to commit pretty hard to make that loadout work, but it's very potent.  Don't worry too much about research point hoarding.  They are precious, but you can eventually get every single upgrades.  I advise picking a loadout you like, maxing it out, and then just never swapping something in until you can upgrade it, except to test it out on a solo DitP mission.  The upgrades make a big difference, and you'll get father faster if you take all the relevant ones for your primary game plan.  Relatedly, you should IMMEDIATELY focus on upgrading the resupply strat, the reinforce strat, the pistol, and probably the nuke.  You'll need those constantly, and going unupgraded is a bummer.  Reinforce isn't glamorous, but when you're running around as the last diver up and staring at a 30 second cooldown you'll wish you'd gone that route as the mission comes crashing down around your ears..."

Helldivers,3do8s2,jophur,5,Fri Jul 17 21:57:13 2015 UTC,The thing that would make my cape twirl with glee would be if you could see the loadout of the players in the game you are joining when on the loadout screen. I like to tailor my loadout to suit my team so hate dropping in blind. For example I'll almosy always rock a recoilless if another team mate is for assisted reload explosiveness fun but don't bother if I'm the only one with one (while others can pick up the resupply pack realistically 99% of divers don't and most bring their own backpack strat).

Helldivers,3dnrgg,jdotp,2,Fri Jul 17 19:42:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've wondered about this.  I'm confident I'm sometimes getting kicked for really random reasons, though, which is a third option.  I joined a guy's game, helped him and the other 2 divers clear like four objectives, last-man-rescued a total party wipe after a hive clear went pear shaped, and then got kicked.  Note that we were all-but-extracted and succeeding.  I asked the guy what was up and he said ""I played four games with no deaths, then three people join and I can't complete a @#*$@# mission!""  I indicated that I would have preferred he wait the 120 seconds to kick me in between missions so it wasn't a waste of 10 minutes of my life, to which he replied ""Well tough s**t.""  So, yeah, there's a third possibility.   Edit: Oh, and recently I dropped in behind an Illuminate wall while the party was fleeing the other way.  I mean I don't know that a kick was super charitable in that case, but I understand.  I was like ""yeah, that seems expedient"".  On reflection I should have probably fallen on my own grenade to get them clear, but it only occurred to me later."
Helldivers,3dnrgg,jophur,3,Fri Jul 17 22:08:07 2015 UTC,"I honestly believe that sort of behavior is petty and just plain spiteful and is the reason why I recently made a post about post game reports/commends.  In your first game he is given the option to turn his matchmaking to private and go on solo runs so that he won't have anyone to blame but himself if he fails. For him to kick you guys after getting his own ass recalled back to life regardless of whose 'fault' it was is just a real dick move.  For your second game, the only times that I've personally ever kicked a person was for maliciously TK-ing and for someone (unfortunately) being an overall detriment to the group consistently albeit without intention to do so.   Sometimes you just get caught behind a wall and it's as simple as that, it's happened to us all at one point or another. Not worthy of a kick at all imo. UNLESS you just get a player who is constantly screen dragging the rest of your team and endlessly popping patrols because he wants to be the glory hound in the post-game kill count.  Sorry to hijack your comment, just had to vent some of my own frustrations"
Helldivers,3dnrgg,CjP1294,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:41:42 2015 UTC,"Well, I concur completely, but to be clear, I joined the game behind the wall.  So they went from ""doing fine and retreating"" to ""where did this joker come from?"".  Which, you know, fine.  At least if I get kicked immediately it doesn't waste very much of my time.  Edit: incidentally, I totally hear you on the post-session report/commend, but I suspect that's a lot harder to implement cleanly than it might sound.  There are a LOT of ways that could be abused.  But e.g. I should get XP for any objectives I personally contributed to if I get kicked from a game, I think.  Or maybe we should just disincentivize kicks.  For example maybe you only get N kicks per hour and then your game gets set to private mode after that session until they recharge, or something.  Because I'm with you.  I've kicked people for a) griefing/otherwise being a willful screwup or b) being not only terrible but also unable/willing to follow instructions like ""quit trying to down three bug tanks with your unupgraded defender, we have places to be"".  If you're terrible and I want better players I'll just quit to title between missions (between planets if you're not untenably horrid) and come back, issuing a soft reset on teammates.  Beyond that, I'm here to play the game.  If a terrible player joins me, guess what, it's a training mission.  Put your seatbelts on, kids."

Helldivers,3dmr9w,wngmv,3,Fri Jul 17 15:11:10 2015 UTC,"If you purchase everything now it will cost about 45 for the base and all dlc. When the ultimate edition releases there will be a weapons pack exclusive that current players will be able to purchase some time after the release I believe, so it will probably cost another 3 bucks. It will cost you 48 in the long run to play right now and if you want to own everything or just wait until the ultimate edition is released and get early access to the weapons pack."

I'm hoping the physical edition will bring in a new player base and higher visibility, but there's really no particular value add over just buying everything now.  Maybe you save a couple bucks when all is said and done?  And maaaaybe you get the new weapons a couple weeks earlier.  But in exchange, you can have an extra month of game time starting in ::checks watch:: about 10 minutes when your game finishes downloading.  I'd trade a burrito for an extra month of Helldivers.  I'd do that over and over."
Helldivers,3dmr9w,jophur,2,Fri Jul 17 22:31:14 2015 UTC,"I was in the same boat and after too much reading I sort of fell in love with the idea of an overhead tactical strategy team based shooting game and just bought it all myself 2 days ago. Helldivers is so unique and fun, partially because of the sometimes frustration of failing a mission. Challenge is good."

Helldivers,3dmr9w,jophur,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:29:29 2015 UTC,Definitely buy it now. If you just cherry pick the DLC packs that you actually want to get you'll probably save some money. Sure having all the DLC content is nice but there will probably be some stuff that you never use or just don't like. Why should you have to pay for everything when you can just find out what packs you might like the most and get them a la carte?
Helldivers,3dmr9w,Charley023,2,Fri Jul 17 18:40:31 2015 UTC,"True, but always nice to buy all and support the devs."
Helldivers,3dmauq,Wongy,2,Fri Jul 17 12:45:51 2015 UTC,"In my experience if you are standing on any part of the train track you are effectively above the rest of the nearby terrain, so bullets will generally sail over enemies. Not the biggest fan of this mechanic because I have not experienced this in other parts of the game."
Helldivers,3dmauq,Lawdog87,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:59:16 2015 UTC,"Never happened to me, but I certainly wouldn't be surprised if there was yet another bug... At the moment the game is unplayable; I was just in a team where we had to abort 3 missions in a row cause one of the objectives was just impossible to complete (meaning when we hit x to do whatever we had to do nothing happened)... And don't let me start on the second star, we seem to never get it even though we all get on the shuttle..."
Helldivers,3dmauq,MBlovesTIX,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:03:48 2015 UTC,yeah encountered the X bug... like trying to pickup a sample 10 times and it still wouldnt register. And the 2nd star bug is frustrating as hell... hope they fix it soon
Helldivers,3dmauq,rdhight,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:07:47 2015 UTC,"Both times that X-prompt bug has ruined a mission for me, it's been a SAM site that did it. Possibly worthwhile to adjust our plans to do SAMs first if possible, to minimize wasted time if this bug appears."
Helldivers,3dmauq,nagua1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:23:18 2015 UTC,"Yes, this is definitely a bug that others have experienced, including myself. It seems to occur primarily with laser weapons. Another user said that the missiles from the new manned dlc turret also pass through enemies as well though.   When I play solo against the Illuminates, I bring the double freedom and the LAS-98, to make sure I have short and long range options. My LAS beam has passed right through those blue laser snipers on multiple occasions when I clearly should have been hitting them. It definitely was not caused by a difference in terrain.   I have actually changed my Illuminate load out because of this bug. Instead of bringing the LAS-98 and the SH-20, I use the Obliterator grenade launcher and wear one of those ammo backpacks. I have not had any problems with the projectiles from these weapons passing through any enemies."

Helldivers,3djknk,Antwolf101,9,Thu Jul 16 20:05:27 2015 UTC,"The pistols are worthwhile perks (gunslinger gives you a Laser Sight AND a sniper weapon) or to put it more rightly the two most indispensible perks aren't such a big deal any more:   You don't need Stratagem Priority much with a strong blue/green loadout... this has always been the case, but it's even easier with the great new wire and turret stratagems from the Entrenched pack. Displacement Field isn't as big a deal as it used to be either, now that the third mission star is so much more forgiving.   Perks are much more a matter of taste now. You're much more free to pick grenades or pistols without getting steamrolled by enemies or being evaluated poorly on performance, and the Helldiver corps is all about sweet freedom.  Pistol perks: I don't know how to use the plasma gun well right now. The flamethrower is a nifty damage add if you're using stratagems that slow your enemies down (so they don't just run you over while on fire). The revolver is an incredible gun especially if it's a contrast with your primary weapon... stalwart, shotgun, SMG, arc thrower.  Entrenched equipment: still not a fan of the shield, but the wire and turret are awesome alternatives to existing capabilities... nothing that redefines the game but they let you bring those abilities with different loadouts and strategies than before.  Vehicles: The anti-tank exo was much needed for mechwarrior players. Bastion and Hammer are fun and effective, having two crew spots makes them really unique."
Helldivers,3djknk,swagohod,3,Thu Jul 16 20:21:04 2015 UTC,"The revolver is pretty badass i have to say, its also freaking huge!   Ive got to say ive been using the wire with pretty good success, great for slowing down hordes while defending an area."
Helldivers,3djknk,jophur,3,Thu Jul 16 22:03:10 2015 UTC,"Your argument for the increased flexibility for the perk slot post-patch is something I hadn't thought about.  That's a compelling argument.  I hate dying as a matter of principal, but that's way more of a playstyle issue than a fundamental necessity now.  Hmmm."
Helldivers,3djknk,TheLethalDiva,2,Thu Jul 16 22:21:01 2015 UTC,Very good points. I completely agree.
Helldivers,3djknk,TheLethalDiva,4,Thu Jul 16 20:26:12 2015 UTC,"Well the pistol perk, grenade perk, and stratagem priority are like insurance perks. The gear you get from using them can't be lost or stolen. Their definitely not for everyone, but their good for giving you a bit of extra firepower and the peace of mind, that their yours to keep for better or worse the whole mission.  I like most of the DLC. I find the motorcycle to be a little lacking. Its just too squishy. Its a motorcycle so it should be fragile, I agree with that. But I think a level 3 Hammer should give you two motorbikes and not just 1. Their just too awkward to use if everyone isn't on one. I think that would help make them more useful, but not overpowered. I could be wrong, but that's just my take on it."
Helldivers,3djknk,TheLethalDiva,2,Thu Jul 16 20:31:18 2015 UTC,"I think you have a point there, having 2 bikes would be fine they are useful for getting around but little else."
Helldivers,3djknk,ExOTiC1234,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:00:35 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Given the choice between a HAV and a squishy motorbike, it really doesn''t seem like much of a choice. At least with 2 you could hook up the whole team and not feel like you wasted your whole loadout on motorbikes."
Helldivers,3djknk,TheLethalDiva,2,Thu Jul 16 23:42:33 2015 UTC,Yeah id really love the bike to get a 2 drop or a multidrop function.   Make it happen Arrowhead ;)
Helldivers,3djknk,ExOTiC1234,2,Thu Jul 16 23:45:45 2015 UTC,"I wish you would get two of them and that it wouldnt run you over when you try to get out. For a vehicle all about mobility, it requires you to come to a complete stop to exit safely which i think is really stupid"
Helldivers,3djknk,jophur,5,Thu Jul 16 23:37:50 2015 UTC,"I think Arrowhead might be open to the idea of tweaking it a bit, once the more pressing patch fixes are taken care of."
Helldivers,3djknk,swagohod,2,Thu Jul 16 23:45:19 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah definitely, those weird bugs that everyone is getting are top priority"
Helldivers,3djknk,ExOTiC1234,3,Fri Jul 17 00:36:47 2015 UTC,"Diva suggested elsewhere that it would be cool if you could get two bikes from the drop.  I agree, but I would go further and say they should work like the SH-32 or Supply Pack, and drop separately on demand.  That would make the fragility of the bike an easier pill to swallow, and seems comparable to what you get for the same slot with, say, an HAV.  If you're with a group that can set down a proper defensive perimeter around you, the turret is phenomenal at extraction and slow (defense) objectives.  It's not great on its own, and it's terrible solo because it can't easily handle smaller units.  Barbed wire is getting very popular, with good reason.  Very strong.  Not a huge fan of the SH-32.  Others seem to love it, which is great, but I'd generally rather have something else on my back.  2-person tank is really good, but requires skill to use effectively.  New Mech is a monster for extraction/defense.  Really helpful for solo runs.  I don't like using a perk slot on the pistols, but I swagohod has a really excellent point about the perk slot being a little bit more open now that I don't feel as desperate to run lots of reds, and now that ""never die"" isn't a prime directive.  So maybe I'll try experimenting more with these and the grenades..."
Helldivers,3djknk,D_Luniz,2,Thu Jul 16 22:19:23 2015 UTC,"Getting your whole team rolling on motorbikes - at all - is a logistical feat, and travelling together to any effect is a complete circus because of speed / visibility / they turn like pigs. Don't even consider it.  The motorbike is best for a pair of divers, carrying a rider + passenger you have someone to read the map and shout instructions so the driver has some hope of getting from A to B without terrain-related misadventure."
Helldivers,3djknk,Drocktimus,3,Fri Jul 17 05:03:16 2015 UTC,"The entrenched pack is great. The Shield+armor combo is great. The turret is amazing! Especially against the illuminate boss. I havent used the barbed wire as much but its like a safer and bigger static field.  Pistols are fantastic. The plasma pistol is my favorite weapon. Get downed? Spam plasma shots all around me and wipe out whatever killed me. Revolver is cool and very powerful when spammed. A trigger finger is helpful when using it. The flame pistol is decent, i never liked flame weapons anyway.  Vehicles are excellent. I cant wait till i get my tank upgraded and start wrecking some cyborgs. Really love the concept of the motorbike but its so squishy and i can only use it against illuminates since the snipers dont one shot it. The mech is meh, the flamethrower runs out of ammo too quickly and has limited range but its anti tank is like GODLY! Its like a recoiless rifle shot and isnt as awkward as the regular mech's missles.  All in all, i rate the DLC a 8/10"
Helldivers,3djknk,Wiktorjor2001,2,Thu Jul 16 23:43:21 2015 UTC,"I think the entrench pack should have had two turret versions like how theres two APCs, one with a cannon and one with dual machinegun, needed that option  well, maybe they'll add a endless wave thing where they'll add that and make the entrenchment pack more useful"

Helldivers,3dkvxj,PepperTitan,5,Fri Jul 17 02:28:14 2015 UTC,You are doing something wrong. I've destroyed both nests and AA guns on many missions using single charges for each.
Helldivers,3dkvxj,coarsesand,2,Fri Jul 17 02:43:15 2015 UTC,"Hmmm. Well thanks, at least I know its something on my end now. That will certainly make a lot of missions easier."
Helldivers,3dkvxj,coarsesand,2,Fri Jul 17 02:53:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, not sure what else to tell you on this one. It's possible you're seeing the objective desync bug where objectives aren't being destroyed/completed. Other than that, just make sure the charge lands right next to the thing you're trying to destroy, the explosion's radius is actually pretty small."
Helldivers,3dkvxj,TheLethalDiva,3,Fri Jul 17 02:56:43 2015 UTC,"Well for bug nests its pretty easy, just throw a demolisher inside of each bug mound and then trigger them once you've moved away. Doesn't even have to be inside the bug nest, but that's what you should aiming for.  As for the AA guns, that's a little tougher, basically the charge has to be right next to it when you detonate to blow it up."
Helldivers,3dkvxj,yaarj,3,Fri Jul 17 03:40:10 2015 UTC,You must place the charge very close to the middle of the AA guns / Beacons.
Helldivers,3dkvxj,themanfromsaturn,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:59:25 2015 UTC,"You can destroy any objective with them, but illuminate ate beacons are challenging because their rotation sometimes knocks the bomb aside.  To destroy the objective, you need it to land pretty much directly on to the target."
Helldivers,3dkvxj,swagohod,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:31:11 2015 UTC,"It will take a couple of demolishers for each AA gun, try to wedge them between the base of the gun and nearby barriers/fences.  I've seen Illuminate beacons need as few as two bags, and as many as ten before one hit the right spot. Fortunately there's no real call for demolishers vs illuminate. EAT launchers are much more effective (shields down and then a one-shot pop) as are shredder missiles (don't even bother bringing the shields down)."

Even if you use it in the worst way possible by stunning your entire team and the enemy. The enemy will be frozen (basically) and your team mates slowed. You could all dive your way through, but you could also blast the enemies with those few seconds of opportunity that the stun grenade has provided you. You can even use it from the ground, two stun grenades back to back if neccesary, and it basically fills the same role that a auto-injector would. Instead of picking you up faster though, it gives you breathing space to get up and get out of there. Its a lifesaver."

Helldivers,3dib14,TheLethalDiva,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:21:57 2015 UTC,I like to use that against Cyborgs actually. Force Field and Stun Grenades.   Force Field gives you a huge advantage against the dogs and the stun grenades are life savers. They have really good synergy together.
Helldivers,3dib14,TheLethalDiva,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:42:22 2015 UTC,"I was showing off gear from the Entrenched pack, trying Heavy Armor and SH-32 earlier. It didn't do much against bugs, mainly because they're hitting me while I'm trying to flee... or poisoned and surrounded... or crushed by a charging behemoth."
Helldivers,3dib14,TheLethalDiva,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:07:51 2015 UTC,"Heavy Amor and SH-32 are better for the cyborgs. But it does work on the bugs too. You need to run gear that can slow them down, since you're so slow. Like poison or stun. For bugs I prefer using the SH-32 with Displacement Field. That makes you pretty tough. Makes you a bit less squishy and the Displacement Field will save you from rampaging bugs and tentacles and sometimes even being surrounded when you get lucky and teleport out.   Bugs like to chase you down, so heavy armor is bit harder to use on them. It works well for cyborgs because their slower and instead just fire their guns on you. And so the heavy armor and SH-32 is going to greatly reduce their damage. But even with them I like to run an Avenger and/or Railgun, as it helps give me distance, even with the drawback of being slower."
Helldivers,3dib14,MBlovesTIX,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:20:21 2015 UTC,You don't get knocked down by the hounds while wearing the shield?! I never noticed that (and since I usually bring the jump pack I haven't tried)!
Helldivers,3dib14,TheLethalDiva,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:16:57 2015 UTC,"They can't touch you when you're protected by the Shield. They'll walk towards you instead of running (most of the time). But if they do charge you purposely or accidentally, they get stunned like they just hit a wall.  Ironically what you have to watch out for is other team mates trying to help you when they shoot you and knock your shield down. Suddenly you're open season for the dogs :o)"
Helldivers,3dib14,jophur,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:32:58 2015 UTC,"This is a cool idea.  I hadn't thought about the shield invincibility for stun.  Anybody tested this with stun mines?  I'd love to go stand inside a stun mine field wearing SH-20 and do a merry L1 jig while enemies stumble blindly around me...  This may be a project for tonight, in fact."
Helldivers,3dib14,TheLethalDiva,2,Thu Jul 16 22:57:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah it works with stun mines. Just tested it, you can run around and set them all off if you want to.  I don't know why I never thought to do it before, but good idea!  You can also use the SH-20 with the razor wire. You can walk, jog, sprint through it like its not even there. It will damage the shield though and it will eventually drop, but as long as you don't play around in it, you'll  be fine. You get about 3 passes per full shield charge, which should be more than enough for most situations.  With the SH-32 you can also walk into razorwire and be completely immune to it's damage, you will walk slowly though while moving through it, but since it never drops you can actually play around as much as you want and stand in the razorwire for as long as you like. So it turns into even more of a fortification for you."
Helldivers,3dib14,TheLethalDiva,2,Thu Jul 16 23:36:47 2015 UTC,"I was playing with Stun Mines tonight. They're the best area-denial strat to deploy right up close. Stasis is really annoying for un-shielded teammates. Razor wire is even worse, longer duration and damaging.  Stun doesn't seem all that valuable until difficulty 10+, at which point you want all the stun to keep the hordes of bullet sponges at bay."
Helldivers,3dib14,TheLethalDiva,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:19:39 2015 UTC,"Static Field is the best I'd say, its safe, it has a quick cooldown, and infinite uses. The problem is so many players use it poorly. Often they'll throw it right on top of a defend or capture objective. Very frustrating as it will often make the objective even harder. Its safe so they can get away with it, but by making the team lose their mobility, it becomes difficult to defend or hold their positions. It works much better if you throw it far enough away so it blocks off a direction. That will generally make the objectives go much easier. The only time I can see when you might want to throw it directly on something is the train, but even then it shouldn't be done if its going to compromise the mobility of the group, unless its some sort of last ditch save.  Razor wire is excellent and can be used much closer than most of the other area control strats. Yes, it does damage, but all you have to do is dive over it or just walk around, its fairly easy to navigate and slows the enemy down nicely.  Good to hear you're running Stun Mines though, glad to see people playing with them on high level dives."

Helldivers,3dfij4,ItsTooEZ,4,Thu Jul 16 05:04:36 2015 UTC,"This weekend Im going to try and show the game to friends via local co-op so I think the fact you can play with people in the same room is a really solid thing you bring up. What was once a given in gaming is now an uncommon feature, crazy."
Helldivers,3dfij4,jophur,2,Thu Jul 16 05:42:14 2015 UTC,"1: Actually, yeah.  I've had really great experiences with Helldivers randoms.  I don't understand why, really, but it's definitely true.  Cool group there as well as here.  EDIT: I should add: you will see griefers.  Report them (from the ""pause"" screen) and then kick them.  They'll lose standing and then they can grief each other.  I imagine this cesspool at -5 - -10 standing where it's basically PVP.  But in any case this is rare enough that it surprises me when it happens, and the exception proves the rule.  2: You'll want the Ranger pack if you're going to spend a lot of time solo.  Mostly I use solo runs as a sandbox to test stuff out without wasting people's time or getting them killed.  It's really a great game solo, it's just opportunity cost -- it's SO AWESOME multiplayer.  But I do solo runs when I want to set my own pace, pick up samples, try out a gun I suck with, whatever.  And I always enjoy that.  I'd say I probably do about 20-30% of my runs solo.  Notably the game scales well with number of players, so the challenge feels appropriate at each level.  It's harder solo, but that's because I'm terrible and so the average skill typically goes up in multiplayer.  ;)  3: Sounds right.  Given that ""everything"" here costs less than any AAA title, and Helldivers is one of the best games I've ever played, I would absolutely recommend getting all of the DLC thus far.  The Pistols will likely take a back seat once you finish leveling, but early on they are really great because you don't need to spend research points to get them fully upgraded.  The Vehicles pack is more fun than critical, I think.  But Pack 1, Pack 2, and the Ranger are all AMAZING.  The Ranger gives you the UAV (See #2), Pack 1 gives you the Commando rocket launcher which is one of my two favorite strategems in the game and the Sickle and Suppressor, which are some OUTSTANDING primary weapons to experiment with.  Pack 2 gives you the Demolisher pack, the TOX-13 (my other favorite strategem, and the Paragon (probably my favorite primary until you unlock the Double Freedom at rank 24, which is many hours away).  So if you can afford it, there's no reason to skip any of the DLC.  It's all great.  (The Specialist and Entrenched have good stuff too, btw, but you're getting those regardless.)"
Helldivers,3dfij4,EdChute_,2,Wed Jul 15 23:41:21 2015 UTC,"Do you happen to know if they'll release a season pass or something? I too recently bought the master of galaxy version and found out about the DLC later on. I know the DLC packs aren't expensive but I'm a student tight on budget so it's nice if it happens to have it!  P.S sorry for asking this question in this post, on mobile rn"
Helldivers,3dfij4,EdChute_,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:53:35 2015 UTC,"The Disc copy coming out is the ""GOTY"" style fully loaded version for $39.99. However buying all the DLC now only costs $1.94 more than the disc copy. While I will also be paying $3ish bucks for the limited exclusive DLC the disc has my impatience won out...  Honestly the fair price for DLC and the free uodate content already provided makes me feel the dev team desreves my money."
Helldivers,3dfij4,EdChute_,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:45:49 2015 UTC,"I do think they deserve too, but buying each one is confusing (not sure which one is better or anything like that too), I'm new to the game though so what do I know. Might just get the DLC I want when I understand the game a little bit more!   It's just that being able to buy a season pass that also gives future DLC would be hella nice!"
Helldivers,3dfij4,jophur,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:30:43 2015 UTC,"Totally understand! But as my post originally asked I too was confused a bit so let me try and break it down:  Masters of the Galaxy is the Base Game + Entrenched Pack + Specialist. This is a special promo that for now replaces the ""Turning up the Heat"" version for a limited time. This is where I started.   Bundle Pack 1 Commando, Defender, Support  Bundle Pack 2 Demolition, Hazard, Pilot  Vehicle Pack has three new unique sweet rides. Fun stuff, but the least needed probably but vehicles ar easily my favorite thing in the game so it was a no question purchase. Having a stratagem list full of power armor is just satisfying to me.   Ranger pack is the only one besides Specialist you might need to buy solo, Specialist being the other only if you didnt buy ""Turning of the Heat"" or ""Masters of the Galaxy"" edition.  -IF- you dont buy Masters of the Galaxy or already owned the base game the Entrenched pack will be seperate as well.   Pistols pack gives you 3 new Perks that swap out your side arm for a very strong secondary, all of them I enjoy  I understand a season pass is great for some games but the DLC in Helldivers is so fairly price I dont think its needed here. For example as I stated I did the math and the disc copy is about $40 and the whole entire collection out now cost me about $42. The limited exclusive weapons from the disc will of course bring the difference to about $5 eventually, compared to buying everything now and getting that sweet satisfaction of an immediate purchase."

Helldivers,3ddnbz,swagohod,2,Wed Jul 15 13:24:27 2015 UTC,Those motorcycles are waaaaay too squishy to be useful. I have never been in a full team game and had the bikes last longer than a minute and a half.
Helldivers,3ddnbz,They_call_me_OP,2,Wed Jul 15 16:50:59 2015 UTC,"True story: last night I successfully drove from one objective to another across the map on a motorbike without having any helldiver fatalities or objective / mission failures as a result. That's the best I've managed so far.  BY FAR the bike is best when your team is only 1-2 people and you've got a series of things you can hit quickly... cruise up to a demolition target and drop the nuke, cruise to a capture point and hang around hoping nobody shows up, etc.  Bastion on the other hand is beyond hopeless on its own but SO VERY GOOD when you've got extra squadmates to accompany you on foot. I'll take that thing over any other vehicle any day of the week when I'm on a full team."
Helldivers,3ddnbz,TheLethalDiva,3,Wed Jul 15 17:38:36 2015 UTC,"I think the Bastion is awesome. You don't need a full squad to use, it works well with two.  You can't really get boxed in with it, like you can with a HAV because you can pivot with the treads. Also it has the highest durability of all the vehicles in the game.  Its only flaw is, randoms will often waste all the ammo shooting at enemies, when most enemies can just be run over. Not so bad using the machine guns on little enemies, but really annoying when they waste all the cannon fire on peons. With a good driver and a responsible gunner though, its probably the best vehicle in the game.  I feel the motorcycle is lacking. I think to balance it better, Arrowhead should patch it so that a level 3 Hammer, drops 2 motorbikes, instead of 1. That would make it much more practical to use, IMO."
Helldivers,3ddnbz,jophur,2,Wed Jul 15 18:15:11 2015 UTC,"Dude, totally.  You get a four seat monster truck with three guns for one strat with the APC, shouldn't the piddly little motorbike have two uses?  You can use them both at once for a biker gang or just have a backup for the inevitable squish!  I see basically no balance downside to this, personally."
Helldivers,3ddnbz,TheLethalDiva,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:16:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree, that's how I feel about it. Giving you two bikes, I don't think would make it overpowered.  I was thinking two at the same time, I don't think it should be like kinetic shield where you could drop one and drop another, although that's an issue the developers could decide on I guess. Probably would be easier for them to do it that way, whatever really is fine with me."
Helldivers,3ddnbz,TheLethalDiva,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:28:25 2015 UTC,"I'd go with the HAV over Bastion if I only had two people. The gunner position is still effective as a turret if the driver jumps out to fiddle with a stationary objective, and the awkward handling isn't as bad when you don't have teammies to worry about running over.  I agree about the motorbike, if you mean getting a second call-down (like SH-32 or the resupply pack) rather than having two bikes delivered at a time (like LIFT kits or EAT rockets) ... being able to make one long drive, get off the bike and probably lose it, then call another bike to make another long drive would be amazing. My own suggestion would be to make the bike useful for transporting courier objectives, so they're a fast and entertaining part of missions (if you're set up for them) instead of the slowest."
Helldivers,3ddnbz,ExOTiC1234,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:14:25 2015 UTC,"Actually I think the Bastion handles better than the HAV because of the two stick tread driving, you have total control over it.  I would agree with you that it doesn't replace the HAV. Having the freedom to swivel the main turret and the two extra seats for team members to jump in and out of comes in handy. Also the Bastion seems to be a bit less forgiving if you exit it prematurely while stopping."
Helldivers,3df5gu,Xhaledk,5,Wed Jul 15 20:00:49 2015 UTC,"Yes, that is correct. And its too late to go offline if you already updated your galactic campaign. Just stick to doing level 3 missions for now would be my advice. Grab all the samples you can. One advantage with the homeworld fights is you get double XP when you do them."
Helldivers,3df5gu,TheLethalDiva,2,Wed Jul 15 20:29:11 2015 UTC,"It's a little scary to jump into a level 3 mission right out of the gate, I remember.  They are in fact easy once you know what you're doing, but the initial learning curve can be kind of daunting with no level 1/2 missions.  The clock on those homeworld assaults is actually pretty fast, so it's a matter of hours before you have access to difficulties other than multiples of 3...  But really, you should go to the multiplayer launchpad in the bottom of the ship area and just join a game at level 3 with other people.  Most of us will happily walk a n00b through a level 3 given the chance, it's hard to really screw things up all that badly, and every home planet mission gives double XP so you'll level up really fast right now.  Once you get the rhythm, you can either keep doing that, try jumping into a 6, or just go farm level 3 missions solo.  But for now go with a group, it's dangerous out there!  BTW, there's a bug right now that makes all missions claim to be ""Helldive - 12"" difficulty on the multiplayer menu, so look at the yellow bar.  If it's a quarter full, that's the mission for you.  ;)  Post your PSN or PM it to me and I'll be happy to add you as a friend when I'm on."

Just wanted to let you know ammo is pretty useless with a laser weapon like the sickle. Unless you are constantly overheating. Id swap it out with something anti tank. Maybe the Eat-17 or Railcannon strike.

Helldivers,3d9abe,SwordsOfVaul,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:18:07 2015 UTC,"Soo I thought I would throw in my two cents on this one.  I see a lot of people saying how to kill tanks by various weak spots and using other weapons but using the commando this is harder and more difficult. I use the commando myself and my best advice is to aim for the top of it (turret base). With the way the rockets shoot up like a javelin hitting the side is a bit less conventional but hitting the base of the turret is easy, just stand a short distance away and shoot 2, it blows in 2 (sometimes one if you hit the sweet spot perfectly) it's not hard at all and with a bit of practice you can wreck multiple tanks on screen in seconds. Remember to make sure it's dead as a tank can have its treads blown but still shoot, just not move. Hope this helps!"
Helldivers,3d9abe,notdaniel21,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:19:27 2015 UTC,"The Commando is one of my favorite weapons, but its not the best weapon to use on tanks. It works, but since you don't really have control over your shots you could waste a whole clip on a IFV and not even scratch it.  Commando is best for Bugs, it wrecks all bugs, its great for Cyborgs, but I wouldn't put it over the Recoilless Rifle. A Recoilless will take down anything. The Commando is great though for crowd control, that's its primary purpose, it just happens to take down tanks too. But its nowhere near as efficient at taking down tanks as a Recoilless Rifle would be."
Helldivers,3d9abe,TheLethalDiva,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:28:37 2015 UTC,"That makes sense.  The Commando is great against the bug tanks, but must not be profitable against the cyborgs.  I'll have to start bringing the recoilless instead on those missions.  Thanks!"
Helldivers,3d9abe,TheLethalDiva,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:48:38 2015 UTC,"It is profitable against the cyborgs. Its just its more of a luxury than a necessity. As long as your team has some anti-armor, feel free to use it. Recoilless Rifle should be a higher priority, but if the team has a Commando and a Recoilless Rifle and they're assisted reloading? Now you're playing with power.  Recoilless is far more efficient at taking out the tanks. But a Commando can fire so many shots and is so fast, that it is far more efficient in taking out just about everything else. Hulks, Warlords, trash mobs. Yeah, having both on a squad really helps alot."
Helldivers,3d9abe,notdaniel21,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:52:25 2015 UTC,"I'll post a vid when I get the chance on how to effectively use the commando on tanks... sure it takes skill but is easy to master and once you do it becomes far more effective since you can take out multiple tanks without reload, as opposed to the recoilless... and since no one still seems to know how to give an assisted reload (need to do a video showing how to do that also lol jk! :P ) being able to use a commando effectively  can be more beneficial than the recoilless rifle... IMO anyways :P"
Helldivers,3d9abe,TheLethalDiva,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:07:46 2015 UTC,"Oh I can destroy tanks with the Commando, although there seems to be two types of tanks? Because sometimes you'll run into a tank and just can't scratch it with the Commando. I'll be on the look out for your vid though. A team using 50/50 is unstoppable though. People always talk about having to run away as the enemy is infinite, if you got the firepower, you can wipe them out completely (for that moment) and the alarm will end, its very doable with a good group."
Helldivers,3d9abe,jophur,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:48:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I totally agree, what the heck is up with that?  There's only one tank type listed in the galactopedia thing, right?

But whatever the case, I can usually tell, even before I fire a shot if its one of the tanks I can destroy or one I cannot with the Commando.  I suppose where you're standing in relation to the tank, could be a factor in determining the Commando's damage. I don't think it does, but it could be worth investigating."

Helldivers,3d9abe,swagohod,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:43:36 2015 UTC,Most of the time just disabling an IFV's treads is good enough. They don't have much sight range anyway. Only when the tank's somewhere really inconvenient do you need to worry about hitting it again to make it go away.

Helldivers,3d9abe,PlayingNightcrawlers,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:25:41 2015 UTC,"A mostly clean hit with the vindicator will either disable a tank so you can just run from it or drop something on it like ammo or a mine detector to finish it off, or if you hit it perfectly it can destroy the whole thing. So you have 12 potential tanks you can handle in a map with that. A sure fire way to kill one without having to aim your throw too much is the rail cannon strike. Get in near the tank and it'll one shot kill it. The cool down is slow and having just one gets tough with an 8 or higher mission so you may need to switch to mines or the RR."
Helldivers,3d9abe,ClydeFlexler,0,Fri Jul 17 07:39:31 2015 UTC,You have to aim your Rocket at the tanks tread cause that's the only weak spot... It has armor and usually shots bounce off the armor
Helldivers,3d9abe,Lawdog87,0,Tue Jul 14 14:52:29 2015 UTC,"The weakest point on the tank is the back. If you throw a C4 and it lands directly behind or on top of the little hatch in the back of the tank it will kill it with one shot. Eat/RR will work from the sides i believe, but the best shot to take is always directly in the backside of the tank."

Helldivers,3db3u2,slicknslim88,5,Tue Jul 14 22:12:11 2015 UTC,"Putting the perk pistols and perk grenades in the default section not only hurts the variety available to you right now, it also creates serious balance issues. To say the perk grenades are useless? Have you even tried playing with them? Smoke lets you stealth, and Stun especially I would rate as a tier 1 perk, allowing you to stun a group of enemies for 5 seconds, its power. Flame is like a air support attack and holds off enemies, although its a little accidental heavy for my tastes, but its good. I love playing with the perk grenades.  As to the perk pistols, again they're all really good and having them as perks gives you the ability to really set up some nice loadout combos or help offset weaknesses some loadouts might have and they help with ammo management. They also help you get around without having to carry a SMG for the SMG's benefits.  The perk pistols and perk grenades are really just basically a 5th stratagem spot, items you can use without worry of being stolen or lost, regardless of how many times you die. I would not want that changed.  As for the Distractor Beacon, its fine, almost no one uses it. What do you care if people play with it or not? Most players who do helldives never even use it, its just not neccesary if you have a decent loadout. For something to get nerfed, it has to have balance issues and everyone (practically) has to be using it. You don't really see that with Distractor Beacons right now.  How are Defend missions unbalanced? Defend missions are pretty easy. It sounds like your loadout might be weak for defend missions. Its not a bad idea to tailor a loadout to what the objectives are for that mission and enemy faction."
Helldivers,3db3u2,TheLethalDiva,2,Tue Jul 14 22:57:34 2015 UTC,"Could not have said it better myself! I don't even remember the last time I used a distractor beacon, must have been sometime during war II."
Helldivers,3db3u2,CaptainTruelove,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:41:24 2015 UTC,"I don't follow your logic. If the sidearms were made regular weapons then it would just free up the perk slot. All your points would still be true if it was a regular weapon, and variety would be increased. The only issues would be that Arrowhead would probably need to add a ""free"" pistol unlock around level 15 just to be ""fair.""   The grenades might have some balance issues especially with the stun grenades, but I hope they figure out how to implement it."
Helldivers,3db3u2,Drocktimus,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:28:28 2015 UTC,"Variety would be decreased, not increased. Having them as perks means you can run a heavy weapons loadout. How does making them regular weapons do that? Also it makes SMG's pretty pointless if you can select these uber pistols as defaults. Keep in mind the six shooter does comparable damage like the Camper and it has a laser sight. Also it would make some of the secondary weapons completely worthless like the machine gun and the flamethrower, its just a terrible idea to make them default gear.  The only way they could do it, would be too nerf the perk grenades and perk pistols, so they would be more comparable to their default counterparts. But still it wouldn't be good for the game IMO. I enjoy using perk grenades and perk pistols, and I hope we see more of these types of perks in the future. You don't have to use a perk if you don't like it, but personally I like them."
Helldivers,3db3u2,TheLethalDiva,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:47:36 2015 UTC,"Again. I don't follow your logic. Why would it stop you from running a heavy weapons loadout? unless you are confusing a weapon unlock with a stratagem? People are asking for a complete retooling of the loadout UI so we can pick more options -not less.   Also -how do sidearms make smg's (or other one handed primaries) useless? The weapons all perform differently and accomplish different roles (to Arrowhead's credit). The pistols are weaker and have less ammo than their stronger primary & heavy counterparts so again -I don't see how that makes anything useless, but rather gives us more options."
Helldivers,3db3u2,Drocktimus,0,Wed Jul 15 20:53:54 2015 UTC,"Because the perk pistols do the same function as the SMG. And their arguably better. The Six shooter has far more range. One of the reasons you play a secondary weapon (other than the unique ones) is that they provide you with more ammo, meaning easier time with ammo management. Having three good weapons to choose from in the default, primary, pistol, and grenade, seriously hurts loadout variety as you don't really have to worry too much about having a secondary weapon, unless its unique like a Rep-80 or has anti-armor capabilities. It just promotes more lets run Displacement Field or Stratagem Priority type mindsets.  If anything it would make more sense for Arrowhead to nerf overused perks like Displacement Field and Stratagem Priority so that people used more spread out choices in general. That's what Blizzard would and does do.   I'm not really pushing for it, but I'd rather they do that, then to start taking fun perks and loadout combinations away. I've already went into all this before on other forums, its not something I really want to keep harping on. It makes more sense to have them as perks, not as default weaponery. Helldivers shouldn't be a game where your new weapons outclass the old ones, everything should feel useful, and for the most part it does. Their are a few items I think they should buff and I actually have ideas on how to fix some of them, but in any event, no I don't agree that they should be added to sidearms, that's just a bad idea. Why would I use a Camper when I have a default pistol that does the same thing? Why would I use a punisher when I have a default pistol that does the same thing? Why would I use a SMG when I have default pistols that do the same thing (and arguably better)? Why would I use a flamethrower (which I could lose) when I have a default pistol that does the same thing? Why would I take any sort of secondary weapon that isn't unique when I have a solid pistol, grenades, and primary weapons to fire to my heart's content? Why wouldn't I always take a resupply pack since now I have 3 strong weapons at my disposal with a possible 4th if I choose to take a secondary weapon? They would almost have to just get rid of the resupply pack, its already really strong with perk grenades, having perk grenades become default and a default super pistol? No, I don't think so. Bad game design, and not something I would really want to waste my time playing. Fortunately the developers get this though. They put alot of thought into the layout, which is why some things like the perk grenades and perk pistols are perks and it shows.  You want more options? Try playing with different perks? Or don't, the choice is yours."
Helldivers,3db3u2,TheLethalDiva,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:16:59 2015 UTC,"Pistols have very limited ammo compared to SMGs (and they appear to be weaker than the fully upgraded counterparts: pistol flame is still weaker than the heavy flame) -there is a trade off. Also the OP is suggesting that the pistols be upgradeable so the revolver wouldn't have a laser sight until you put 6 points into it. So no, it wouldn't be a default overpowered ""no brainer"" choice.   Having three good weapons to choose from in the default, primary, pistol, and grenade, seriously hurts loadout variety as you don't really have to worry too much about having a secondary weapon, unless its unique like a Rep-80 or has anti-armor capabilities.   This is true in game right now even without using the pistol perk -you just have to upgrade the default pistol. Moving the perk pistols to a weapon slot doesn't change this.   The reason why displacement is used so often is because there aren't very many other stratagems that perform crowd control very well. A lot of groups hate stun mines. The solution is to add more crowd control options like the barbed wire drop from the entrenched DLC.   There would be issues with the grenade perks causing balance issues, but I'm sure Arrowhead is clever enough to figure out how to make them balanced.    You want more options? Try playing with different perks? Or don't, the choice is yours.   You keep saying this and I think we are arguing two different points (semantics anyone?) You seem to be saying that there are plenty of options, and indeed there are. However, I and the OP are arguing about ""literally"" (the literal definition of literal) there being more choices in your loadout, and we think it makes sense for grenades and sidearm to be a part of that loadout choice."
Helldivers,3db3u2,Drocktimus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:23:46 2015 UTC,"Pistols have enough ammo compared to the SMG's that you would never have to worry about taking an SMG ever again. Please don't pretend like it wouldn't matter, because it would. Most of the SMG's would become irrelevant. The whole point of the SMG is when you're carrying a suitcase or on the ground, the pistol has more than enough ammo for both those things.  Again, why use a Camper or Punisher when I can just pick a Six Shooter as my default pistol, who cares if you have to upgrade them. I have over 300 research points right now....upgraded....now what? You still have the balance issues. It really just doesn't work. Your taking away from the game's tension, because now when I run out of ammo, no problem, I'll just switch over to my six shooter. Or Paragon, flame pistol. And combining perk default grenades with stratagem priority and the backpack? Talk about evil. But at least you admit the perk grenades would be broken. But in any event, why should I have to give up my perk grenades again? How does that make any sense? You don't like the perk so I should give up the perk? I'm sorry that doesn't work for me.  The reason why displacement field and stratagem priority are used so often is because their the best perks in the game, easily. You could make a case for some of the others, but most would agree that displacement field and stratagem priority are the top two. And you're right to say Arrowhead is clever enough to figure out how to make grenade perks balanced....by making them perks, hey imagine that?  When I say moving these things over would limit your options, I'm saying it totally cuts out the tension of running out of ammo, of having or even wanting to run a heavy weapon loadout. You still could obviously, but it becomes much less of a concern. Using SMG's becomes much less of a concern. Using sniper weapons becomes much less of a concern. Now that that base is covered we can focus more on having airstrikes and field control. It just strips away one of the facets of the game and reduces the tension. I don't think it would be good for the game. Some facets of the character should be constant, you have a decent gun and decent grenades, but their not great. The perks let you bend those rules, so now you have a gun that's equivalent to a primary weapon. You have grenades with fantastic powers that aren't quite stratagems, but not far off the mark, very useful and very abusable (to a point) since you can use them twice back to back and you get them back every time you die or pick up ammo."
Helldivers,3db3u2,TheLethalDiva,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:44:45 2015 UTC,"Except SMG's and other one handed weapons perform differently than the pistols. I'm not taking a SMG because of a suitcase or the downed state. I have a perfectly capable pistol for that, but it's an option. Pistols do not make SMG's irrelevant otherwise no one would be using one. Pistols carry 3-4 small magazines: most primaries carry twice that amount. There is still a trade off. SMG's have short ranges but are one handed and have other useful perks like mini-stun etc. Every weapon has trade offs.    You made a big deal about pistols being powerful by default when that isn't even what the OP suggested. I'm just addressing your incorrect assumption over the OP, and the pistols may need to be toned down if placed in a weapon slot. I think the flame pistol is fine as is because it has a very short range. Maybe the range on the six shooter should also be lowered. We aren't arguing for op options. Just options.    Arrowhead is clever enough to figure out how to make grenade perks balanced....by making them perks, hey imagine that?   Or they could just lower the stun duration to 3 seconds, and give boss enemies a diminishing return on stuns?    But in any event, why should I have to give up my perk grenades again? How does that make any sense? You don't like the perk so I should give up the perk? I'm sorry that doesn't work for me.   I never said anything about giving up your grenade perks? If this was directed at something you think I said then you should examine your reading comprehension.   Some facets of the character should be constant, you have a decent gun and decent grenades, but their not great. The perks let you bend those rules,   First thing you've said that makes sense to me. I totally believe that if arrowhead does move pistols and grenades to their own slots in our loadouts that it shouldn't make anyone a one man army. Each piece of equipment should be balanced with that in mind, and I don't think it's impossible for them. It would just take time and resources, but the game would be better for it.   Also, my regular team hates it when I bring displacement field (which is also totally ineffective against Illuminates). So some players would disagree with you about that.   Stratagem priority is one of the best perks if you want to be calling in stratagems frequently. My solution would be to make perks that are just as good that tailor to other play styles. Perks for vehicles like extra armor (at the cost of handling). Perks like ""from my cold dead hands"" that allow you to hang onto your heavy through deaths (at the cost of slower reloads or less ammo). Perks like ""pack mule"" that allow you to keep your back pack through deaths but slow you down."
Helldivers,3db3u2,Drocktimus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:02:35 2015 UTC,"Perk pistols are powerful, not the default pistol. Its decent, but its clearly weaker than the perk pistols or the SMGs. Right now the current default pistol just does not compare to using an SMG, which is why people use them. The perk pistols definitely do. And the suitcases and using them when your downed is why you take a SMG, why else would you take them? Just because? You like only being able to shoot at half the screen? Come on, stop already. Its ridicilous and insulting for you to say well I don't use an SMG for briefcases or when I'm downed...that's precisely why you use them.  And this whole topic is about moving the perk grenades to the regular loadout. ""1) Migrate the pistols and the grenades over from perks, to weapons."" Something with your pretty much agreeing to with your posts, so that is making me lose my grenade perks. Maybe its you who should examine your reading comprehension?  I've already told you even if it was a compromise and the perk grenades were kept and gimp versions were introduced, it kind of defeats the purpose of having perk grenades in the first place. And it throws the game's balance right out the window. All the perk grenades have abuse potential, all 3. Even making them dud grenades hurts the game as it gives people an out to not have accidents with the standard frag grenades. And yes people have even asked for the option that they should be able to disable their grenades. Should they be able to do that? I say no. It takes away from the skill of playing the game. Its similar IMO to the people who think we should have the option of changing our button configuration and what commands are linked with what buttons. It kind of throws the game and individual player skill totally out of kilter.  Displacement Field is good against Illuminates, its probably the best perk you can bring. No Displacement Field means automatic death to walls and to Snipers. What does your team bring to fight Illuminates? Stratagem Priority is good. Cardio is good because Illuminates struggle if you keep moving, Flame grenades are good because their weak too flame, and Auto Injector is very good against them. But I'd still say Displacement Field is the best and safest choice.  I still see no reason Arrowhead should get rid of Perk grenades or Perk Pistols. Its just limiting and it takes away from the game.  And no offense, but I'm not really liking any of the perks you mentioned, they just seem kinda blah to me. I would like for them to add a perk that decreases reload times, that would make the recoilless/commando weapons stronger in solo but still not as strong as it would be with an assisted reload, it would help the machine gun alot and it would make Arc Weapons a viable strategy. Even without a combo in mind, just using any primary weapon it would be good to have. I think that would be a top tier perk for sure, but not overly obnoxious or powerful."

I used the defender for the mini stun and armor penetrating rounds. Not so I could carry a brief case. Everyone still has a weapon when carrying a brief case (with long range burst fire AP rounds if upgraded).   regarding reading comprehension. No one is saying you should lose your grenade perks. No one. But you accused me of not liking the perk and saying you should lose it. Just read the OP again. He explains it pretty well.

Helldivers,3db3u2,Drocktimus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:42:46 2015 UTC,"(   Having three good weapons to choose from in the default, primary, pistol, and grenade, seriously hurts loadout variety as you don't really have to worry too much about having a secondary weapon, unless its unique like a Rep-80 or has anti-armor capabilities.  This is true in game right now even without using the pistol perk -you just have to upgrade the default pistol. Moving the perk pistols to a weapon slot doesn't change this.)  This is not true in the game right now. I love using the secondary weapon Machine Gun on the Bugs, it helps immeasurably with the Rail Gun's limited ammo.  I also like using the Avenger, partly for the poison, but again mainly because it helps with ammo management.  And the FlameThrower is great with poison/flame and flame/cardio builds.  I really wouldn't need any of them though, if a cool new uber perk pistol was part of my default starting line up."
Helldivers,3db3u2,TheLethalDiva,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:59:59 2015 UTC,Easy fix. Reduce the pistol ammo to two (or even one?) magazines across the board. Now it's just an emergency last ditch option -and that is all pistols should be. I totally agree with you about the atmosphere needing to feel chaotic and desperate.
Helldivers,3db3u2,Drocktimus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:15:57 2015 UTC,Or just leave them as perks. Their fine the way they are.
Helldivers,3db3u2,TheLethalDiva,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:36:17 2015 UTC,"According to your logic they aren't. Right now I can bring a super powered default pistol, a primary, and heavy secondary; with a backpack and never have to worry about ammo management ever again. The ""evil loadout.""   EDIT: I'm teasing. I think they are ""okay"" right now. I still think it makes more sense for us to have more control over all the options in our loadout."
Helldivers,3db3u2,Drocktimus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:03:06 2015 UTC,"Another thing I didn't even go into was like right now. I joined a bug mission after it had already started. I dropped an Angel and an Avenger, but before I could get going I was surrounded by bugs and my team mates activated a nuke and fled the area leaving me to die. I tried to go back, but you know how that is, sometimes random team mates just won't go back for your gear. It was so close, but what could I do? So I have to play the whole mission without half my loadout. Using a Rail gun that has very limited ammo, an ammo drop and Vindicators. Not too bad, but definitely annoying. I was running Displacement Field, so at that point I wished I had picked perk grenades or a perk pistol. Because basically the perk grenades, perk pistol, and stratagem priority are like insurance perks. Even when the worst case scenario like that happens. You got at least one goodie that cannot be taken away from you, and that the Six Shooter or Flame thrower would have helped. Mission ends. We start another, this time I take a Machine gun for a secondary and the Kinetic Shield. I love stratagems like Kinetic Shield because even if you lose it, you get a second chance, but you can also live dangerously, and hook up a random team mate and that not only helps the team but it might earn you a commend as well. So I do that, I give out the second shield right away and this time we make it all the way to the extraction, the machine gun as always proving invaluable. At the extraction, the machine gun runs out of its clip and I don't have time to reload because the machine gun is slow to reload and the area is just crawling with bugs. So I'm forced to use my Railgun. Not too big of a deal since I was able to conserve much of my ammo, having relied on the machine gun when I was able to.  But the point I'm making is, there would have been no reason to take a Machine gun if a perk pistol was part of my starting line-up. I probably would have just picked stratagem priority and ran airstrikes and control. Ammo management is a very crucial part of the game and so giving you too many tools, just takes away the tension. It also takes away the tension of gear being left behind since now you basically have two primary weapons at all times and possibly vastly superior grenades. It would suck the fun out of the game I think. Having your gear get left behind sucks, but its also what makes Helldivers so fun, having to adapt and overcome with your default gear, sure its not great but it can get you through the mission. Taking an insurance perk means you lose out on something good like Displacement Field, but it also means you'll always be better equipped as well. And by giving you these benefits but at a cost, helps keeps the game balanced. Its just a great and compelling component to the game, IMO.  By the way, one of my team mates was using Stun Grenades. So people do use them and they are useful."
Helldivers,3db3u2,TheLethalDiva,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:55:55 2015 UTC,"Stratagem priority is one of the best perks if you want to be calling in stratagems frequently.

Stun grenades are probably the reason why arrowhead is worried about balance issues. Imagine a whole team with stun grenades fighting a boss. Of course they could just lower the stun duration and give heavies a diminishing return on multiple stuns."
Helldivers,3db3u2,Drocktimus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:22:57 2015 UTC,"All the perk grenades are good, stun grenades just happen to be the best. But when I say their the best,  that's just my opinion. The flame is kind of like an air support attack. Great for holding enemies at bay and closing off choke points, but it also is great for causing accidents, if your sloppy with flame grenades or get knocked over when your about to throw one? Then someone will die, because they do lethal damage to helldivers and the activation is instant, very hard to escape death if you get too close to the flame. There are people that play with the smoke, its pretty cool, it kinda has a niche use really, that being stealth. Stunning a mob of enemies is always useful and always practical and they don't cause Helldiver accidentals, not directly anyway.  Again, since I love stun grenades, why would I want Arrowhead to make a gimp version of them? If they were default it would have to be mini-stun, which would be no fun, but people would use them because many don't like having accidents like you do with the frag. Been on many a mission where players hurl their grenades away to prevent accidents. But the frag grenade accidentals is again, something thats fun with the game, you shouldn't have the luxury to just switch them out, unless you pick the perk of course. Its just part of the chaos and fun of the game."
Helldivers,3db3u2,TheLethalDiva,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:43:13 2015 UTC,"Added to Drocktimus point, you were saying that no weapon should feel like a legit upgrade to another, and that is true.  By saying that I'm assuming that you are suggesting that the perk pistols are a legit upgrade to the standard pistol, but that's simply not the case, same with the grenades. As it is now, you are replacing a solid pistol and solid grenade choice with an equally solid pistol and grenade choice, just with specific purposes.  The problem is you are sacrificing a valuable perk slot to essentially make a side grade to your load out instead of an upgrade.    Even you must see a problem with that?"
Helldivers,3db3u2,TheLethalDiva,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:33:56 2015 UTC,"No, you're not replacing your default pistol and grenade with equivalent gear. I would say the perk versions are superior. Their not stratagem strength gear, but their definitely stronger than default gear.  So no I personally don't see a problem. I guess if people felt that way they could be buffed, such as having their durations increased. But after playing with them. I don't really think they need much of a buff, if any really. The fact ammo restores them and that you get them back whenever you die, means (as I'm sure you'd agree) that you wouldn't want to make quite as strong as a normal stratagem weapon would be. But I think their definitely better than the default gear."
Helldivers,3db3u2,TheLethalDiva,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:42:36 2015 UTC,"Why not make them stratagem strength?  I mean you have 4 stratagem slots, you only have 1 perk slot.  But I really love to hear your argument about how the perk pistols are upgrades for the default pistol.  Mentioning that each pistol is good for specific purposes is a mute argument because that was my initial point."
Helldivers,3db3u2,TheLethalDiva,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:56:04 2015 UTC,"Because that's boring. I'd rather have them as perks so they can be in-between strength, so they can be the oddball weaponry which they currently are and so I can combo off them with my loadouts.  I'm not going to continue the conversation. You can go back and read what I've already posted to see my position on this."
Helldivers,3db3u2,jophur,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:13:09 2015 UTC,"My point is, for example if you ran a bug mission using ONLY your pistol, and did that with every perk pistol as well, you would find that each pistol is good in certain situations.  Patrol control goes to the default and the Singe, but the other pistols suck at taking them out.  Flames is too low range and the six shooter just doesn't have the ammo or the multi kill potential.  For bigger bugs, goes to six shooter and the flamer, but the singe is dangerous for yourself if they get close and the default bullets have to be precise in order to do max damage, also takes several bursts.  I could go on, but I hope you get the point that they all are good for different situations.  For a weapon that takes up a perk slot, the weapon should be hands down better than the default in every conceivable way.  That just is not the case."
Helldivers,3db3u2,jophur,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:14:55 2015 UTC,"But you can use flames to kill bugs. Just set them on fire and run away till they die. I've done it, it works. You can also poison them and set them on fire for easy kills.   Same with the Six shooter, I can ping off bugs all day with just the six shooter, I really enjoy that. As for getting swarmed, well you can always poison them so they can't easily get to you, and then its like shooting ducks in a barrel.  I love the pistol, but it just does not compare to the perk pistols. Sure its good for what it is, but the perk pistols are better, IMO."
Helldivers,3db3u2,Drocktimus,0,Thu Jul 16 18:23:58 2015 UTC,"You really need to work on your reading comprehension, or maybe actually read the posts before you reply.  I specifically said using ONLY pistols to spot the strengths and weaknesses.  And then I mentioned several examples like the flamer and six shooter being poor for killing patrols but good for killing bigger bugs, you should read it again and more carefully."
Helldivers,3db3u2,TheLethalDiva,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:16:10 2015 UTC,"I agree with Diva re: Distractor Beacon -- it's not a balance issue to me.  It's a matter of whether you like playing stealth or not.  I like that they are there as an option, but if somebody on my team was just constantly running them I might get bored and go play another game.  I don't see that as a design flaw.  And actually on reflection I think Diva is right about defense objectives as well.  The thing is, you CAN fail a defense objective.  You can't fail a capture objective.  You can FAIL THE WHOLE MISSION, but the capture objective was still sitting there when you aborted, waiting patiently for you to come tackle it.  As a result, we see a lot of missions concluding with failed defends or rescues, but none with failed captures or SAM sites.  And that makes it seem like the defends are harder than they are.  I agree that I tend to fail defends, but that's mostly because I'm lazy and they take longer than most objectives.  Probably not a big deal."

Helldivers,3d42j8,robothorror,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:07:57 2015 UTC,"FLAM-40 is stronger with initial damage and a bit of damage over time.

Helldivers,3d42j8,Bsingh7,3,Tue Jul 14 03:48:38 2015 UTC,"Flame works best when combined with poison.

Helldivers,3d42j8,Bsingh7,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:16:13 2015 UTC,"Well instead of making one stratagem that does both, I'd like to see more stratagem combinations, especially to make less used gear more useful.  So like lets say you fire a Arc Weapon into the new Razorwire, it could be electrified for a few seconds. This wouldn't (IMO) make razorwire overpowered, but it would Arc Weapons much cooler and I think you'd see people play with them more. More stratagem combos and more co-op stratagems that also work for solo play, just not as efficient for solo (such as assisted reload versus reloading yourself). Those are things I love seeing in Helldivers."

Some weapons you can stand your ground, with the Double Freedom you need to always be moving in and out of the zone. Part of what makes the gun so good is it sets the enemies on fire, so the longer you can play keep away, the more likely they'll just drop dead from flame damage.  And the closer you are to the target, the more damage it does when fired."

Helldivers,3d0alc,verikosto,5,Sun Jul 12 12:17:11 2015 UTC,"In general, I think the original six packs are the best.  Here's a more specific review of each, in roughly the order I would reccommend purchasing them.  Ranger -- Sniper Rifle Primary -- Scouting Strat  My take: If you want to level quickly this is a must buy.  I've never used the rifle yet -- I hear it's great, but the Railgun is comparable, and available in the base game.  Dat UAV, tho.  Damn, son.  Seeing samples on your map makes solo-grinding for research points SO MUCH LESS PAINFUL.  If you don't plan on doing solo sample gathering, skip this.  Otherwise, it's probably your top priority.  Demolitionist -- Machinegun Primary -- Anti-tank Grenade Strat  My take: The Demolisher Strat is one of the absolute best items in the game.  It takes out objectives, it takes out tanks, and it's activated on a cooldown so you can never lose it no matter how much you die.  The Machine gun is cool, too, but you're buying this for the Demolisher.  Specialist -- Energy SMG Primary -- Strafing Run w/ rockets Strat  My take: opinions vary widely on the CAS strategem.  I suck at using it, and the cooldown feels cumbersome to me, but other ::coughbettercough:: players swear by it, so YMMV.  But none of that matters because the Tanto is one of the best weapons in the game.  I don't run it all that often any more, but I'm rarely in a group where nobody is running it.  Until you unlock the Knight it fills an important gap in your arsenal.  (The Ninja might do this, too, if you want the Commando launcher, but I wouldn't probably buy both of these up front.  One or the other, and I recommend this one.)  Hazard Ops -- Poison Assault Rifle Primary -- Toxin Sprayer Strat  My take: I ignored this one for months, and then I saw somebody who was super effective using the Toxin Sprayer.  Holy crap it's great.  The Paragon assault rifle is now one of my favorite primaries, too.  Neither of these items is particularly critical, but this should be high in the purchase order just for raw day-to-day utility.  Good stuff.  Defender -- RPG Primary -- Offensive Drone Strat  My take: Neither of these is necessary.  Both are Exceedingly entertaining.  The Suppressor is one of the most satisfying primaries in the game.  It's not as effective as it initially seems, and you need to be very good at aiming before you can get away with this one and not just rack up team-kill after team-kill.  But this is the weapon that more than any other leads to new players saying ""holy hell what is that sweet-ass weapon?!"".  And the Guard Dog is extremely helpful for solo runs or when you're going to be busy reloading a larger weapon a lot.  So get this one for fun, but it's pretty baller.  Commando -- SMG Primary -- Rocket Launcher Strat  My take:  I haven't used either of these yet, so I can't say much.  The Commando rocket launcher is well respected, but it's application seems situational.  And the Ninja is cool, but I think the Tanto is better in most situations.  So take my opinion on this with a grain of salt, but I think you can leave this one alone until you're really ready to just buy everything.  From what I've seen I'd take the Recoilless Rifle and the Knight over the items in this pack, and they're available in the base game.  Vehicles -- Mech Strat -- 2-person Tank Strat -- 2-person Motorcycle Strat  My take: If you're running with a single friend a lot of the time, the 2-person vehicles are a huge huge win.  So glad they added these.  And the anti-tank specialty mech is GREAT if you're in late-stage content with lots of tanks.  But on a more general basis these are kind of more trouble than they're worth, I think.  Low priority  Support -- Energy Assault Rifle Primary -- Defensive Drone Strat  My take: I'd save this for later in the game.  The Sickle is well-respected, and if you're not too trigger happy it can be one of the best guns in the game.  But I'd generally rather take a non-energy assault rifle or the Tanto SMG, depending on context.  And there's nothing wrong with the Angel Drone, but it takes up a backpack slot, and the opportunity cost is huge.  I'd always rather have a Guard Dog, Jump Pack, Shield, Supply Pack, or just be available to carry ammo for somebody with a recoilless rifle.  So this is a reasonably good pack, but low-priority.  Pilot -- Arc Shotgun Primary -- Mech Strat  My take: I was so excited about these items when I started.  I no longer am.  The Pilot Mech is actually very very good vs Illuminate, but it's kind of terrible otherwise.  And the Arc Shotgun is both very hard to use well without killing your teammates and not super effective against the late-game content, in my experience.  I pretty much never see this in the field.  So I'd say you'll eventually want this for the anti-Illuminate mech, but it's a low priority.  Entrenched -- Shield Pack Strat -- Barrier Strat -- Manned Anti-tank Turret Strat  My take: I have not been having a lot of luck with this stuff.  The barrier strat is GREAT, but it's largely redundant with the mines and the napalm.  It's very good, and worth the price of admission, but I'd say it's a low priority buy.  The other two I've tried a fair bit, and...  I dunno.  I'm not sold.  The anti-tank turret might be pretty cool, but the cooldown is REALLY long, and it takes 7 seconds to drop, which means it's basically an extraction-only item, MAYBE useful for defend or capture objectives at higher difficulties.  As always, opportunity cost is key -- most of the time I'd rather bring a recoilless rifle or the anti-tank mech instead of that thing.  And I have not seen a situation yet with the SH-32 where I didn't just wish I had a base-game shield bubble or a Guard Dog drone instead.  Pistols -- 3 different perks that replace your pistol with a much more powerful alternate  My take: There's a lot of discussion about this one on this subreddit.  The thing is, to my mind, the opportunity cost is just SO HIGH, here.  Heavy Armor, Stratagem Priority, Cardio Accellerator, Laser Sight, Displacement Field, Autoinjector...  There's a lot of stuff you're giving up to bring one of these.  If you find youself struggling once downed, I think you're much better off bringing a one-hander like Knight or Tanto or Ninja into the field.  These are really fun, effective weapons, but I would make this the very last pack you buy."
Helldivers,3d0alc,jophur,3,Sun Jul 12 23:59:11 2015 UTC,"The barbwire has a different utility to it, most things wont cross fire so area denial is awesome right? Except it will fuck you up if you get downed with the beacon not thrown or miss throw, static conducter awesome slowing power that traps enemies easy targets doesnt hurt the team and can be dropped on sensitive objective's to prevent enemies from getting close enough to damage it, also it doesnt stop cyborg tanks or shielded enemies, the barbedwire does and It's longer the balance to it is that its not deep and doesnt slow as much, personally i think it goes enables the team to be able to breath and pick thier shots it lasts so long that you can use the new environment to trick and work against heavy enemies and finally it does small amounts of dmg just perfect for scouts."
Helldivers,3d0alc,derangedsky,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:03:39 2015 UTC,"Absolutely.  I'm not saying the barbed wire isn't valuable -- note that I have purchased all of the DLC.  My purpose here is strictly to prioritize which DLC creates the most interesting variation in gameplay so that you're getting the most bang for your buck with the first purchases.  I've been super impressed by the barbed wire and am always glad when somebody brings it.  Edit: And as a corollary, if you really enjoy playing area control there's a great argument for grabbing the Entrenched pack early on.  Ironically if the pack contained ONLY the barbed wire, but was exactly the same price, I'd probably have recommended it more highly.  The other two items feel so lackluster to me thus far that I rank the whole pack lower.  Brains are weird."
Helldivers,3d0alc,jophur,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:44:05 2015 UTC,"I was just giving and outline of the balance and utility, what maybe what i though the key difference's of those three things are. I think you haven't seen the turret utilized correctlly with good support and time to set up, it CAN be very good, so can almost everything about this game, many things when used right (or wrong for that matter) are extremely powerful if not limited in scope."
Helldivers,3d0alc,derangedsky,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:45:24 2015 UTC,"Again, I completely agree.  But ""they're all great!"" doesn't provide useful guidance to the OP who wants to spend < $allofthe, so I'm trying to rank them somehow.  Helldivers + every single DLC is still less than the cost of any AAA title, and I think the game's worth more than a AAA without the DLC, so provided you can afford the full pricetag, I see no reason not to just buy them all.  I've enjoyed every single pack, at least aesthetically.  As to the turret, I tried it out more last night, and I agree -- if you're with a team that knows how to set up a perimeter around it, it's an absolute wrecking ball.  (OTOH, if you're with a bunch of nyancats who won't defend your six from an invading pack of brood commanders, you're deliciously stationary bug candy.)  So the Entrenched pack is rising in my esteem, to be sure."

Helldivers,3d0alc,Ant010,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:38:45 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's really a disagreement.  This thread wasn't about which DLC was good, it was about how to prioritize buying it.  [EDIT: well, I guess the thread was sort of ambiguous on that front, actually.  I should have said my toplevel comment was about how to prioritize buying it.]  The Entrenched pack has risen in my esteem in the last week.  I'm still not personally enthused about the SH-32, but your enthusiasm is not uncommon.  Mostly this pack makes it easier to set up a defensive line, whereas other packs I've suggested purchasing earlier in the order provide tools that you can use for the whole mission.  And the SH-32 is at least approximately interchangeable with the original shield generator.  So, I think the Entrenched pack is great and would now rank it at least above the Pilot pack.  But if you were going to strip me of all but two packs of my choosing, Entrenched wouldn't be one of the two I'd keep.  If you're saying it would be one of the two you would take, then we definitely disagree.  And you should by all means provide another ordering for the benefit of readers!  =)"
Helldivers,3d0alc,jophur,3,Tue Jul 21 01:12:25 2015 UTC,"If you wanna support the devs, I'd say.. everything!  But if you're strapped for cash and just want a DLC in terms of all-around convenience, I'd say get the Demolitionist Pack. The REC-6 satchel charge is mighty handy and very portable in dealing with heavy opponents.  As a second option, I recommend getting the Specialist Pack. The LAS-12 'Tanto' laser SMG packs a mean punch against almost all light to medium targets, downside of course is its shorter range. But another upside to it is, since it's an SMG, you can carry objectives while still wielding the Tanto!  Edit: Almost forgot the Close Air Support stratagem included in the Specialist Pack. It's pretty good at murdering Illusionists/Council Members in seconds.  Hope these help!"
Helldivers,3d0alc,jirakjimas,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:40:12 2015 UTC,"I think that all are great, and if you want to support the game and the devs, buy them, maybe in stages. The Ranger Pack if you want to collect samples and get points, because of the UAV drone. Both Reinforcement Packs because are bundles and cheaper. The Especialista has the Tanto, one of my favourite weapons. And the new ones, the Entrechned ist awesome nothing more to say. The Vehicles are brutal, and we've been asking for something like this, since the begining. The only thats its a bit ""meh"" its the Pistola, because they are perks and I dont feel comfortable  with that, I rather prefer my displacement or priority. If in the future it's changed I'll buy it totally."

Helldivers,3d0alc,jophur,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:13:27 2015 UTC,"ranger pack is very useful with the UAV which allows you to reveal hidden objectives and really helps sample hunting. the camper is also a very good gun if used correctly.  support pack because the SICKLE is very good against foes at low to mid levels but falls off at high levels against illuminates and cyborgs, THE BUGS on the other hand, the SICKLE slices through them like butter, an added bonus is the need to not bring ammo which frees up the slot.  finally the demolitionist pack. the stalwart, while not the best choice of a primary is very good due to its high magazine and it is also noob friendly due to its lack of TK ability. the demolition charges or what I like to call them ""D-BAGS"" are a very good tool against cyborg and bug armor, due to their damage and infinite drops."

Helldivers,3cyh57,StarfighterProx,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:20:09 2015 UTC,There was an assault on a home world? I need those alert posts to know when to hop on and help!
Helldivers,3cyh57,jophur,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:37:14 2015 UTC,Lol so far we have failed to take the illuminate and also are gonna fail the bugs at this point. Sorry I should have posted the flair but the event started while I was asleep and worked the next day so I didn't know until like 16 hours in.
Helldivers,3cyh57,TheLethalDiva,0,Sun Jul 12 03:40:13 2015 UTC,"The new patch introduces lots of glitches that either prevent stars from registering on mission completion, or just break objectives so thoroughly (e.g. unliftable carry objectives, uninteractable interaction objectives) that missions don't get completed successfully in the first place.  I actually think they should give us the war again this time around, because glitches in the game are the reason we're losing it, irrespective of skill."
Helldivers,3cyh57,jophur,2,Sun Jul 12 18:38:32 2015 UTC,"But we're not losing the war, we're winning it.  And yes the new patch brought some glitches with it, but nothing really too game breaking. I've had two games back to back where I had to quit because the you couldn't interact the objective. I've had the game freeze and some other issues I find mildly annoying. But for the most part, the majority of the missions I've played have been fine. The really bad glitches don't happen enough to where I would call them deal breakers for anyone wanting to get into this game. And they're certainly not bad enough (yet) for me to stop playing Helldivers."
Helldivers,3cyh57,TheLethalDiva,-2,Sun Jul 12 19:10:09 2015 UTC,"What war are you looking at?  I'm seeing two home planet invations where we're behind by >50%.  Also, you're in a thread about how we're losing Keplar Prime?  So ... no.  As to the rest, I agree, I'm not ceasing to play Helldivers.  But you actually consider regularly being totally unable to complete a mission non-game-breaking as long as it's not a majority of games?  If so, you have a way more generous disposition than I do, congratulations.  Crucially, none of these problems existed pre-patch.  The patch gave us some nifty new gear, boss fights that I can't mostly participate in because we're too busy ""winning"" the war, and crippling bugs that ruin ~10-20% of the games I play.  So, I stand by my position."
Helldivers,3cyh57,jophur,0,Sun Jul 12 19:49:10 2015 UTC,"You said we're losing the war though. How are we losing the war, when we've pushed two of the three factions back to their home planet and the cyborgs are being pushed back as well. So obviously we're winning the war. If you're referring to the battle at Keplar Prime, the reason we're losing that is simple, its because many players don't want a repeat of the last war and so are keeping the other factions in as long as possible so we can crush all 3 at the same time. The new boss battles help contribute to that mindset, which I think is a good thing.  When you play 50 missions or so and only have game breaking issues with 2, then yeah I wouldn't call that game breaking. WWE for example most of the online matches result in splits or crash midway point and the developers seem to care little to fix it as this has been a problem since I started playing it back in WWE 13. Certain moves are unblockable, infinite move glitches, etc, that have been in the game for 3 years now.  I agree with you that's annoying, but I think you saying the game is unplayable because of it is not really fair to say either."
Helldivers,3cyh57,TheLethalDiva,-2,Sun Jul 12 20:40:23 2015 UTC,"I... you are setting up a straw man and then tearing it down, over and over again.  I thought we were having a conversation, but that is not what is happening.  So given your definition of victory, you ""win"" this dialogue.  I'ma let you have it."
Helldivers,3cyh57,jophur,2,Sun Jul 12 22:52:27 2015 UTC,"How am I setting up a straw man? You are telling outright lies. You say the game is unplayable. Yet it has over 1000 players on it at all times. You say we are losing the war? Even though we've pushed two of the three alien races back to their home planets, with the third about to join them.  So how am I setting up straw man arguments? I'm giving you facts and you either don't like them or don't know how to respond them.  You're upset over the glitches from the current patch, I get that and I appreciate that, but you're blowing them out of proportion when you say the game is unplayable and we are losing the war, because your wrong on both accounts."
Helldivers,3cyh57,TheLethalDiva,-2,Sun Jul 12 23:22:54 2015 UTC,"That would be the straw man, Diva.  Never said that.  Said there are game-breaking bugs.  Did not call the game unplayable.  Indeed I actually said I'm still playing.  You're blowing my arguments out of proportion and then getting upset because ... they are blown out of proportion.  I'm only responding at this point because I don't like the idea that somebody out there thinks I'm an idiot asshole, even if that somebody is you.  Hubris, nothing more, is perpetuating this utterly pointless discussion.  ::sigh::"

Anyway throw all the insults you want and edit your posts all you want. The fact is you exaggerated about the glitches and said we were losing the war, even though we're not, and I called you out on it. Conversation is over."
Helldivers,3cyh57,TheLethalDiva,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:25:11 2015 UTC,"Are you suggesting I edited my original posts to no longer say ""unplayable"" so that I could be ""right""?  That also did not happen.  I also have not particularly insulted you, except in saying ""even if that somebody is you"", which wasn't ad hominem so much as a nod to the absurdity of me caring about your specific opinion even in the abstract.  Edit: an insult, if you're looking for an example, would be calling me a liar because you disagree with me.  That's insulting."
Helldivers,3cyh57,Shiki-tianzi,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:37:10 2015 UTC,"I didn't call you a liar because I disagreed with you. I called you a liar because you insulted me and lied. Again, you said the game had game breaking glitches and we are losing the war. The fact is neither is really true.  We are crushing all three races and the glitches while annoying are not really happening enough to be considered game breaking."

Helldivers,3cw9d2,Yosinuke,6,Sat Jul 11 08:29:43 2015 UTC,I think I read that the level 6 planets are the most efficient for Samples.     I would go something like: - Cardio perk - UAV - Distractor Beacon - Turret (for easy defense objectives)    The first three are the ones that I take for sure.    Good luck!
Helldivers,3cw9d2,Blues_Drive,3,Sat Jul 11 09:13:40 2015 UTC,"Depends on who you fight. Level 6 is by far best for sample farming doing level 9-12 planets is best for experience. If you want both stick with level 6 during homeworld attacks and defend city missions.  For farming bring fully upgraded UAV and at level 6 you can pretty much bring whatever the hell you want to use.  I tailor my outfits for the race I'm fighting. I tend to go a more black Mage route for illuminates, blue Mage for cyborgs, paladin for bugs (the typical RPG tropes carry over quite well).  So for illuminates it would look something like this (depending on objectives and whether or not I'm going for a completion, XP, or samples):  Perk: strat priority Weapon: tanto (don't have to waste a spot on ammo) otherwise take patriot Stratagems: shield, orbital laser, CAS, strafing run  This prevents reverse controls and stunning, orbital laser rips the illuminate apart, CAS for council members, strafing run for tripod hordes. Again modify as needed (UAV for samples, stomper to help capture flags/evac, etc. but this general illuminate load out has served me well and allows me to do level 12 planets with it).  For cyborgs:  Perk: strat priority Weapon: tanto or justice/breaker Stratagems: demo charge, shield, (if a lot of defends I take 2x rail cannon turrets; otherwise I take rail canon strike and vindicator)  Demo charge is great as it destroys big units, shield prevents dogs from charging, rail canon turrets also destroy the larger targets, vindicator helps clear mobs.  For Bugs:  Perk: heavy armor (little bugs can't hurt you) Weapon: tanto or justice/breaker Stratagems:  if a lot of defends: rep 80 (to heal turrets) jump pack/shield/supply pack), 2x tesla turrets aka bug zappers (or take 3x and leave the back pack) If mobility is needed: vindicator (to clear mobs), rail cannon strike for big bugs, pesticide sprayer (a little bit goes a LONG way), and supply back pack (take justice/breaker with you)  These are all my general load outs that you can take up to level 12 hell dive (cyborg you'd need more anti armor) and modify based on the mission objectives.  Hope this helps/gives you some ideas."
Helldivers,3cw9d2,CaptainTruelove,2,Sat Jul 11 21:19:05 2015 UTC,"If you wanna solo Helldive difficulty planets, you can try out my classic go-to loadout:   Stratagem Priority AR-20L Justice 2x Static Field Conductors or 2x Hellfire Incendiary Bombs (depends on faction; the latter being most effective against Illuminates because Static Fields initially don't work on Tripods/Striders and Illusionists/Council Members) Resupply Heavy Airstrike or Railcannon Strike   It's an all-around load-out that I've most of the time been using since day 1."
Helldivers,3cw9d2,jirakjimas,2,Sat Jul 11 09:59:01 2015 UTC,"It doesn't really matter as long as you have ammo. For higher levels, make sure you have an angel, mech, or shield and you might want to destroy ""defend"" objectives yourself since it's very easy to get overrun. Just hug the sides, try to avoid patrols as much as possible, and keep fighting to a minimum unless you're backed into a corner and have to fight your way out. Since you're alone, it's a lot easier to run away from firefights."
Helldivers,3cw9d2,FBISurveillanceVan69,2,Sat Jul 11 11:15:30 2015 UTC,Sickle Cardio or Stratagem Priority Distractor Beacon  UAV CAS Either another Distractor Beacon or CAS    Found this works for me when going for samples against the illuminates on around level 6. May be worth seeing about swapping out either the extra Distractor Beacon or CAS with something you can take out Destroy objectives with.

Helldivers,3cuq9j,ChuPeek,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:38:57 2015 UTC,"Yes, they always drop horizontal to how you throw them, just like any other air support stratagem. It will make way for obstacles so keep that in mind, like if a rock was in the midddle of where you threw it, it would put a small patch of fence on both sides. Which is cool, although you can get cheated that way. But its great because you can place it closer to the group than you would ever want to for static fields and especially mines. Its great to throw in front of a turret by the way."

Helldivers,3ctbki,EdChute_,3,Fri Jul 10 16:37:35 2015 UTC,"You can use a one-handed primary weapon (any SMG, an upgraded Double Freedom shotgun) in any situation that would normally force you to switch to your sidearm. There's also a pistols DLC that lets you pick some alternative sidearms by selecting them as a character perk... big-ass revolver, flamethrower, plasma gun.  Breaker is a top-tier gun for damage output. Others might come close in that respect but with much more precision. Personally I really like the SMG type weapons; on lower difficulties they don't compare well with assault rifles, but when things get hard their stun effects keep you from being eaten.  Drones are DLC  Buy the DLC  You can skip days on the war but don't tell anyone you're not giving 110% for Super Earth. Liberating planets adds points to the influence meter in any sector, filling the meter captures the sector for our side. Enemies can counter-attack the sector capital, in which case we've got to fill the influence meter on the capital planet before running out of time. If we run out of time we lose the sector. When we've captured all the sectors belonging to an enemy faction, we have to do the same for their homeworld during a 48-hour event. If we can beat the clock, that faction is out of play and we can focus down on the remaining enemies for the rest of the war."

From time to time one faction attacks one of our capitals and we need to defend it for the next 3 1/2 hours or that region is lost. If we lose all regions they can attack Super Earth. You can miss some days."
Helldivers,3ctbki,TheLethalDiva,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:09:09 2015 UTC,"So:   Kinda. With this latest update in one of the DLC packs they've introduced 3 new pistols, the only problem is that if you wanna equip them you'll have to give up your perk since they're gonna occupy that slot. Plus, there are also some primary weapons that you'll unlock by leveling up that are one handed (for instance the two smgs and a shotgun that you'll gain at around level 20). Here's what I usually bring with me: with bugs I like to bring Double Freedom (that shotgun I was talking about earlier), which has an upgrade that unlocks incendiary ammo; with cyborgs I always equip the Paragon, which is part of the Hazard Ops DLC pack and I love it! It's an assault rifle with poisonous rounds that slow down enemies and a bayonet which is great for killing those damned hounds! You run out of ammo kinda quickly but you kill enemies practically instantly! With the illuminates I either bring the Defender smg (which is great for taking out scout troops so you don't have to deal with infinite groups of enemies), which stuns enemies, or the Camper from the Ranger pack, which is kind of a sniper rifle so you do a lot of damage with each shot. The UAV drone is part of the Ranger DLC pack Just buy them from the PlayStation Store and they'll unlock in the game! The more influence you get at the end of each mission the closer we get to conquering a region. Once we get to the home planet of a race, we have a certain amount of hours to defeat them; if we succeed that race won't be part of the current war anymore, if we fail we get knocked back to the previous region. You can read more about this in the Encyclopedia on your ship!   Tips? Once an objective is done MOVE. You don't wanna fight endless waves of enemies for no reason whatsoever. And if you're using a Recoilless Rifle (a stratagem that you'll unlock) and someone else is using it as well, RELOAD EACH OTHER! It takes a second, while if you reload it yourself it'll take much longer! I'd say let someone else pick up the support backpack but people may already have something on their back or, in most cases, they don't know about the assisted reload which is superfrustrating... -_-"""
Helldivers,3ctbki,MBlovesTIX,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:35:35 2015 UTC,"All 3 pistols though are pretty good and well worth using as perks. Its basically becomes a secondary weapon/5th stratagem that cannot be lost or dropped.  Paragon is great if you run it with a resupply pack + ammo, this might seem counter intuitive to many players, but its not. When you pick up ammo you not only get the immediate benefit for your weapons, but the ammo is copied in the backpack as well. Meaning you can fire your Paragon as much as you want, and you'll never run out of ammo.  Perk guns work well with the Paragon too, as the extra gun helps with ammo management. The Dirty Harry pistol is like having a Camper/Punisher. If you're on the ground and a brood commander is charging you, it will take him down in about 3 hits. And it has a laser scope.  A Resupply Pack/Paragon/Ammo drop set-up also works very well with perk grenades.  (and any ammo hog weapon will do, it doesn't have to be the Paragon. Could use the Breaker or Justice, any weapon that eats ammo fast)."
Helldivers,3ctbki,TheLethalDiva,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:31:14 2015 UTC,"I did buy the pistol pack the other day after reading your review and I'm liking them but I do feel the lack of autoinjector... Yeah, the Gunslinger is pretty awesome and the built in lasersight is very useful! The one I didn't use that much is the Singe cause you have to be REALLY careful when you shoot XD   Yeah, the resupply pack paired with the Paragon would be great but I don't see myself going into a mission without the jump pack!"
Helldivers,3ctbki,MBlovesTIX,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:18:06 2015 UTC,"Oh cool. Also I'm curious to why you like using the Defender? Not bashing your choice, I'm just curious as most players will use the Knight over the Defender. What is it about the Defender that you really like?"
Helldivers,3ctbki,TheLethalDiva,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:35:20 2015 UTC,"You know, I have played this for 128 hours but I don't think I've ever tried the Knight! LOL The thing that throws me off probably is the lower stability, I don't wanna risk hitting my teammates by mistake!"
Helldivers,3ctbki,CannabinoidAndroid,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:50:16 2015 UTC,Oh you won't. Stability means the shots tend to fly straight more. Hitting enemies straight does more damage than if you hit them from an angle. An angled shot can result in it being deflected or doing less damage.
Helldivers,3ctbki,MBlovesTIX,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:05:03 2015 UTC,The Tanto is a pretty amazing gun.  As an energy weapon it has infinite ammo so long as you don't over-heat it.   Over-heating will disable the gun until you put a new capacitor in it (Energy weapon version of reloading).   Fortunately you get 3 capacitors when you spawn / pick up ammo and after a few missions you'll get good at heat management.   There have been many times I've been able to save allies who are reloading / indisposed since I never have to stop or check rounds left. The constant beam and speedy rotation while firing makes the Tanto an amazing bug-sweeper.  About the only downside to the Tanto is that it's beam only reaches about 60% of the screen length.  So you won't be popping patrols at the edge of the camera FoV.  You CAN however catch patrols coming around terrain and drill through them pretty quick.
Helldivers,3ctbki,TheLethalDiva,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:42:19 2015 UTC,I wanted to buy a primary laser weapon (cause in my opinion the Scythe is atrocious) but I don't know what to choose... Tanto or Sickle? Do you have experience with both of them?
Helldivers,3ctbki,MBlovesTIX,2,Fri Jul 10 18:13:25 2015 UTC,"Sickle and Tanto are two of the best primary weapons in the game. Remind me what else you get in those DLC packs? I believe its Angel with the sickle and close air support with the tanto.  Well I gotta say I like the Angel alot, but most players are kinda eh on her. That pack also gives you a snow white medic attire, which is one of my favorites in the game.  The Tanto pack gives you Close Air Support (I believe) its a very good air support strike, especially for bugs. Its a bit weaker than Air strike but has a shorter cooldown and a lightning quick deploy time.   Honestly their both great weapons, just look at the packs in their entirety and see what you would like having best. For me, I prefer the Tanto. Looking at them from a total DLC pack perspective I would get the Sickle for the white uniform and cape, and for the Angel, which I absolutely love.  P.S. Just to warn you, the Angel is a backpack item, meaning no jump pack for you, when you use her. So you might be better off buying the Specialist pack."
Helldivers,3ctbki,TheLethalDiva,2,Fri Jul 10 19:30:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, considering the whole pack I would definitely prefer the Support one (Angel would actually be a valid alternative to the jump pack)  but literally everybody seems to prefer the Tanto (I already know I'm not gonna use close air support, I can't stand offensive stratagems like that one and the strafing run, they're so invasive)..."
Helldivers,3ctbki,jophur,2,Fri Jul 10 19:53:44 2015 UTC,"Actually, not knocking the Tanto, but more players use Sickle than they do Tanto. The three most popular primary weapons in Helldivers that I've seen are.....the Justice, the Breaker, and the Sickle.  So I think the support pack is a good choice."
Helldivers,3ctbki,swagohod,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:00:59 2015 UTC,"I'm not a fan of CAS because I can't spam it, but strafing run can be extremely helpful, since it is always there when you need it.  Getting used to aiming it is a PITA, but worthwhile, and you can launch it from a mech suit.  This works especially well with the new mech, because the SR acts as your machinegun backed up by both a flamer AND a cannon.  Fun times."
Helldivers,3ctbki,SeldomSeen31,2,Sat Jul 11 00:12:13 2015 UTC,"Aww don't hate so hard on the Scythe. Not primary is as hardcore about murdering weak enemies like bug and illuminate scouts.  Between Tanto and Sickle I'd lean towards Sickle.   If you have stellar aim and a light touch on the trigger, Sickle is the best single-target primary weapon in the game. The other popular guns (Justice and Breaker) have to resort to damaging everything in their shot path to come up equal.  While I do still use Tanto a lot, it's very good at what it does, its priorities are in the wrong places: still a laser weapon that can't spam off-screen kills, and an SMG that doesn't stun the brutes you're in close combat with."
Helldivers,3ctbki,CannabinoidAndroid,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:20:52 2015 UTC,"The Tanto is nice because of its status as an smg enables good movement while firing.  I love leading a pack of butchers around the screen by the nose.  You may not kill them, but you take them away from the team while they reload and finish them off."
Helldivers,3ctbki,jophur,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:45:05 2015 UTC,"AFAIK Tanto is part of the Specialist pack which was free with Turning Up The Heat (so you might already have it).  IMO Tanto wins hands down. While the Sickle has range it doesn't have the damage output the Tanto does.  The Tanto is strong enough (and sweeps quick enough) that you can sweep fodder enemies and usually drill through stronger fodder rather quick.   If I need a screen length laser beam (against Illuminate, etc) I'll usually call down a LAS-98.  Though be aware that the LAS-98 has a terrible turning rate while firing so you can't really ""sweep"" in the same was as the Tanto."
Helldivers,3cunyf,RestingValhallaFace,12,Fri Jul 10 22:36:25 2015 UTC,the twirl is how we divers express ourselves and show off how fancy we are. not doing so is a act of treason and probably means you lift too.
Helldivers,3ct8gj,notdaniel21,2,Fri Jul 10 16:13:32 2015 UTC,The bug boss I'd say is the hardest by far.
Helldivers,3ct8gj,TheLethalDiva,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:19:14 2015 UTC,Yeh it seems many people agree with this... not calling for a nerf at all though I love fighting it!
Helldivers,3ct8gj,ExOTiC1234,2,Fri Jul 10 19:31:30 2015 UTC,Bug is hardest and illuminate is easiest IMO.
Helldivers,3ct8gj,4rindam,2,Fri Jul 10 18:17:48 2015 UTC,i found the cyborg boss to be the easiest...just keep throwing mines and lure the boss into the minefield.  Hive lord is definitely the hardest.That poison kills very fast and the amount of brood commanders and tentacles makes it more worse.
Helldivers,3ct8gj,Wiktorjor2001,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:01:38 2015 UTC,"Still havent got to fight the great eye, soon though!!"
Helldivers,3ct8gj,WillUpvoteForAss,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:31:52 2015 UTC,"Cyborg one , aa's are annoying."
Helldivers,3ct8gj,rnewb,2,Fri Jul 10 16:18:16 2015 UTC,"No way, the cyborg boss is the easiest. Yesterday I didn't die once against it. Strap on a personal shield and the dogs are less agro. Once it stops moving get away from its cannon. Know that it's harmless from the sides and back — other bosses have a 360° attack. Move the squad in a big circle and shoot aa's along the way. I spammed Eat17s so everyone got a chance to pick at it. It's harmless from the side and back. Pretty sure conventional bullets and lasers don't hurt it so you can save ammo for the scrubs.  Hardest boss? Maybe bugs. It spends too much time underground so it's hard to kill it before the tentacles come out."
Helldivers,3ct8gj,cjmoka,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:35:18 2015 UTC,"It actually is very easy, just clear the AA and rain strat hell on it, I used 3 Rail cannons with strat priority, but I have heard others using mines and thunderer. Biggest thing though is to stay mobile, watch out for the dogs!!"
Helldivers,3ct8gj,4rindam,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:33:18 2015 UTC,"All three are doable by a good team, with one exception: snow. Any of the three on a snow planet is diabolical."
Helldivers,3ct8gj,robothorror,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:43:09 2015 UTC,"My first boss attempt was the Hive lord on a snow planet... Took 43 minutes, but we got there in the end...   I like the challenge of taking on the siegemech and great eye on snow however..."
Helldivers,3ct8gj,Shiki-tianzi,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:42:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah,the bug boss on snow planet took my team a total of three tries to defeat."
Helldivers,3ct8gj,puddpuddpudd,0,Fri Jul 10 20:03:29 2015 UTC,"lol havent done one on a snow planet... would probably avoid that at all costs lol, though maybe if you have the hav or new tank and a good gunner it could do some work??"
Helldivers,3ct8gj,puddpuddpudd,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:34:15 2015 UTC,"Bug is definitely the hardest.  It's fast, it moves underground, and leaves only small windows of opportunity to deal damage to it. Cyborg was definitely the easiest."
Helldivers,3cuifv,-Yngin-,2,Fri Jul 10 21:54:37 2015 UTC,"No, I don't think its important. If you're experienced with the game, you'll usually be able to tell what perk everyone is running. Its not essential information and would just clutter the player HUD, IMO."
Helldivers,3cuifv,TheLethalDiva,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:42:19 2015 UTC,You can already tell what perk they are using as there are visual cues...
Helldivers,3cuifv,CaptainTruelove,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:23:19 2015 UTC,"If and when they use it, sure. But how can you tell stun grenades from strat priority before either is used?"

I dont really know...i just kept trying and that ended up working at some point (try restarting your vita)

Helldivers,3cp5bh,CannabinoidAndroid,3,Thu Jul 9 18:24:06 2015 UTC,I looked at this. You still kill everyone else on the team every time you fire.
Helldivers,3cp5bh,swagohod,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:26:43 2015 UTC,Also remember that heavy armor by itself prevents little bugs hurting you.
Helldivers,3cp5bh,CaptainTruelove,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:48:57 2015 UTC,"Right, I haven't tried using both on the bugs just yet. Should help though with the physical damage I suspect."
Helldivers,3cp5bh,coarsesand,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:31:22 2015 UTC,"I've been ""running"" around in the heavy armor and shield for the past few hours as I farm Illuminate 6s for samples, and it's tons of fun.

Helldivers,3cp5bh,jophur,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:55:08 2015 UTC,Cool thanks
Helldivers,3cp5bh,gruntunit,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:17:23 2015 UTC,"Well I can show you my loadout. Perk: Heavy Armor Primary Weapon: Suppressor Ammo Kinetic Shield Demolisher Razorwire barrier  So range is important, the heavy armor and kinetic shield allow you to fire the Suppressor at practically point blank range. But when I say ""practically point blank range"", I don't mean pressing up against them. You can see for yourself how close you can get by doing a dive in the park and firing it next to a rock or building or something.  Don't be afraid to melee, the Suppressor has a bayonet, and you'll need it at times, especially for the dogs. I think the guy I was playing with right now actually recorded a mission. They were so impressed that at one point the entire team ran my build with slight modifications. Instead of the razorwire, one of them ran mines and the other guy ran close air support I think. The important thing is whatever else you decide to run you have to run heavy armor + kinetic shield or it won't work.  If I find out he recorded, I'll post the video link. If you want to do a mission together sometime, we could maybe do that too.  P.S. Also having poison on the team helps for giving you some space, you could drop the demolisher for an Avenger, depending on how equipped the rest of the team is for anti-armor. But the Demolisher is generally more important, as you need some way to deal with tanks and Warlords. The Suppressor can handle the rest."
Helldivers,3cp5bh,Rocksalty,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:42:32 2015 UTC,"So ""point blank"" but still with the shield between you and the enemy. Makes sense and I can't believe I didn't make that connection."
Helldivers,3cp5bh,robothorror,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:42:31 2015 UTC,Exactly. You can practice on a level 1 mission against a wall if you'd like. To see just how close you can fire it safely.

Helldivers,3crvls,RestingValhallaFace,3,Fri Jul 10 07:19:23 2015 UTC,Some weapons have recoil which gets worse the longer you hold down R trigger. Use burst fire or upgrade the weapon for better stability.

Helldivers,3crvls,metroid02,2,Fri Jul 10 09:01:02 2015 UTC,"While shooting your weapon, you will be pusing R down. If you're not too careful, you'll actually move the entire psvita. Thus causing unwanted right stick movement and shaky aim. I first noticed this phenomenon with Dead Nation."

Helldivers,3codh3,CannabinoidAndroid,3,Thu Jul 9 14:25:19 2015 UTC,Just playing devil's advocate here. What advantage does the the stationary manned AT turret have over the Tank (The IFV from vanilla) without a driver?  Both seem to have one-shot capability and the tank can be repositioned.
Helldivers,3codh3,Suicidal_Ferret,3,Thu Jul 9 15:08:34 2015 UTC,"Lower profile and smaller. In addition, if you happen to have the whole team in the IFV when it blows, mission failed.  Also the manned AT turret is one person, leaving 3 others to focus on non-armored targets or what have you."
Helldivers,3codh3,Zealluck,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:38:14 2015 UTC,That and it also has slightly higher fire rate and 3 uses.

Helldivers,3codh3,TheLethalDiva,2,Thu Jul 9 16:42:04 2015 UTC,"The new shield is awesome. I know it seems disappointing at first. But keep in mind two things.  1) You got a spare  2) More importantly and what people never bring up, is the shield never goes down. A normal shield has a recharge time, the SH-32 doesn't. It will always protect you (although not to the extant a shield will). I think its great.  And I agree with you on the Razor Wire, I really like it. I don't think its quite as good as Static Field. But I think its good enough to use and its alot of fun."
Helldivers,3codh3,TheLethalDiva,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:41:31 2015 UTC,"SH-32 is like Heavy Armor, and I can imagine the two combining to make you just about bulletproof against enemy small arms (maybe friendlies too)  SH-20 is more like Displacement Field ... it's useless if you're constantly being chipped at, but you can get whacked by an instant-kill hit without even noticing.  Razor Wire vs Stasis is typical of green vs red stratagems in general... Stasis is more tempting if I'm not running around with Stratagem Priority and a whole bunch of spammy attacks. Razor Wire works with non-SP loadouts, you don't have many deployments but each one lasts 4x as long as stasis or napalm.  One great way to use razor wire is in combination with an anti-tank mine field: targets that would normally be a waste of a mine will die in the wire, saving your explosives for guys with tank-like health."
Helldivers,3codh3,dsilenser,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:20:25 2015 UTC,"Yes, the SH-32 + Heavy armor will make you bulletproof, but only from the front.  If you're constantly being chipped away by the enemies (like the Illuminates) you're much better off using Angel, because she completely cancels out chip damage. The SH-20 will save from the snipers though, from the cyborg hounds, being one shotted by a tank, explosions, etc.  Stasis I think is better, faster cooldown and infinite calldowns. But the razor wire is excellent as well and it has alot of cool combos you can do. Like you said, razor wire + mines. Manned turret with a razor wire in front of it, etc. Its a excellent addition to the game."

Helldivers,3codh3,TheLethalDiva,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:50:40 2015 UTC,"I don't think its a bug, it just protects you from the front. Making it inherently weak against explosives. I think so long as all the explosive damage is in front of the shield it should provide some protection.   Also if you combine it with heavy armor it will prevent most gatling gun damage. To the point where you could actually face off and kill him before he kills you.  I made a topic on it right now, if you want to just read that."

Helldivers,3cnt2i,Lawdog87,4,Thu Jul 9 14:27:38 2015 UTC,"I think interactions between different items would be pretty awesome.  Some quick thoughts:   The shield generator could expend their stored shield to overcharge a laser or ark weapon so it could do more damage. If there are two people with drones hi-five the drones Voltron into a larger more powerful drone that doesn't need to stop for ammo. Either it remains this way as long as the two using it are within 1/3 of a screen of each other. Or the drones do some burst effects that stun/heal/do a lot of damage depending on the combination of drones, then they resupply. When the flame thrower and the bio thrower interact mid air they create a superheated toxic mist that stuns. If you have jump jets and the RR you can do a Rocket Jump by jumping pressing fire to fire the rocket at the place you jumped from. Lasers interact with ark weapons, whenever a ark weapon crosses a laser it does more damage, the Laser would also do more damage for 2 seconds. When someone calls down an RR, a new ""stratagem"" is available. The code is randomized and synced to the RR. Your character then activates the tag feature on his pistol and his next shot will stick to a target. RR now will home with the ability to make a 120 degree turn in the space of the screen. Possibly a Perk to use. People who jump past each other hi-five mid-air. Requires perk."
Helldivers,3cnt2i,avar,2,Thu Jul 9 14:52:27 2015 UTC,"I think this is the best suggestion in this thread, it would be much more fun to have cool and unexpected interactions between stratagems & weapons than new weapons."
Helldivers,3cnt2i,Lawdog87,2,Thu Jul 9 15:38:14 2015 UTC,Thanks!  Really anything that encourages more teamwork and coordination would make the game even better. I think these kinds of interactions would be cool because the whole community could enjoy them and hopefully wouldn't be incredibly resource intensive to make because the assets are already created.
Helldivers,3cnt2i,Shiki-tianzi,3,Thu Jul 9 16:12:11 2015 UTC,Very Nice!But i think the first one mobile cannon  is not so good.... although it has a powerful fire....but it is not enough! Why i should use this weapon?RR is  better than  mobile cannon.  But the idea of this weapon is amazing :) We can have something like that!
Helldivers,3cnt2i,InSanitangles,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:12:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input! Well, in order for it to be picked it would probably have to be really powerful, like the screenclearing kind of powerful. I mean, the RR can take out one enemy at a time, and has to be realoaded in the meantime.  Imagine instead a powerful cousin of for instance the railgun, that can just cut its way through hordes of IFVs, behemots or warlords if used correctly. Higher risk but higher reward."
Helldivers,3cnt2i,Shiki-tianzi,2,Thu Jul 9 11:24:27 2015 UTC,And it could have 6 (or more) rockets in the chamber before needing to reload.

Helldivers,3cnt2i,Texotron,2,Thu Jul 9 12:16:58 2015 UTC,"Really like the assisted aiming idea - clean and interesting. I imagine one guy gets a laser pointer, maybe with a fixed range like the grenade thrower. The other guy fires the weapon, the shot flies for around 1.5 seconds homing in to the laser dot.  Would be a good idea if it's useable in solo as well somehow - only worse, like the recoilless rifle."
Helldivers,3cnt2i,CannabinoidAndroid,2,Thu Jul 9 11:42:46 2015 UTC,"One idea for a new stratagem would be a jettisoned fuel barrel. It would drop down from your ship and have two ways to use it:  Shoot it, and it would explode, destroying anything in the kill zone, and setting fire to any near by survivors.   Or alternatively you could melee it, causing it to start leaking it's fuel. Then it could be picked up and carried, leaving a trail of highly flammable fuel behind. when you are ready, you or a teammate can hit x to activate it, creating a wall of flame, much like the incendiary wall stratagem, except this would be longer and more customized.   This would be a dangerous stratagem to use though, because a stray bullet while you are carrying the barrel could cause an unfortunate accident."
Helldivers,3cnt2i,FunMetalAlchemist,2,Thu Jul 9 17:01:22 2015 UTC,"So these ideas are all sports theme'd. JUST GO WITH IT!  - Frisbee -  Yeah, no typo.  We need a frisbee. No explosives, no tricks. Just give me a frisbee that I can toss back and fourth with other divers while waiting for an objective to clear.  We've already fortress'd up the area with Anti-tank mines, napalm, barbed wire and turrets.  Now we need a frisbee to pass the time.  -A backpack full of C4-laiden Nerf Footballs from the movie Three Kings-  Unfortunately I can't provide a video reference so you'll just have to take my word for it if you haven't seen this amazing movie.  Basically three soldiers (Ice Cube, Mark Wahlberg, George Clooney) during the first Iraq war are being chased by a low flying helicopter. So one of them grabs a small football with C4 wrapped around it, winds up and bullet passes that thing right into the cockpit.  PLEASE GIVE US A BACKPACK FULL OF EXPLOSIVE FOOTBALLS.  Make it so others can pull the footballs out of the backpack to throw them.    Also whoever wears the backpack has a small (10%) chance to have a football fall out when they dive for cover."

Helldivers,3cnt2i,Shiki-tianzi,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:03:17 2015 UTC,"And what about a shield generator bunker size, you call the stratagem and bring something like the tesla tower but with a shield. Perfect to defend objectives or to have a ""portable bunker"", you can fire from the inside, and take some damage from bullets, cannons and grenades, the infantry units can go through and kill you or destroy the objective. Activation time 5-7 secs, Number of uses 2-3, Cooldown 180 secs. Upgrades, reduce the cooldown, increase the number of uses, increase the shield durability, increase the shield recovery speed (the shield will recharge until the generator tower is destroyed). Note: when you are inside the SH-20 and the SH-32 are disabled, to avoid interference problems."

Helldivers,3cjwf4,Dredd907,44,Wed Jul 8 14:12:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this post, it really does bring down our spirits releasing new content and people hating on us for it.  So let me clarify a few things in this thread that holds a very good tone: First of all we always appreciate feedback, and I hope it's obvious that we listen to the community, not just when things are on fire, but always. It might not mean that we do what you suggest, but we do take it into consideration.  As for ""Just making another slot for pistols"", that's not how it works. Making another slot for pistols fundamentally changes game balance, requires a rework of the UI, and would segregate the community as the pistols could slip into ""necessary"" content.   It is an enormous investment in time and effort to do this ""simple"" change, time we decided to put on bosses instead. In the future I might want to design things differently based on the feedback we have received from Helldivers, but it's highly unlikely that we will change this now.  As for our business model, we have one we would like to see others use. There is a saying that people do as you do, not as you say, and I think we show people that we do as we say. This is how I personally would like to consume DLC.  As always, remember that the DLC is indeed optional. You are not required to have it to play with your friends or the rest of the community. You don't need it for any trophies, of which we have added several to the game since release. Buy DLC if you want it, don't buy it if you don't want it. And if you want something that isn't available, tell us about it and we might make it for a future update."

Helldivers,3cjwf4,TheRedJester,4,Wed Jul 8 21:48:22 2015 UTC,Could you add an extra stragem slot that can only be used for pistols instead?
Helldivers,3cjwf4,superbleeder,9,Wed Jul 8 17:28:22 2015 UTC,"Heck, even a stratagem slot called ""Alternate equipment"" where you could use the pistol perk OR the grenade perks...without having to lose your combat perk...call it ""Equipment Perk"" and limit to nade perks and pistol perk...this would give ALL players the ability to use alternate grenades as well, as I can only assume they are barely used now if every game I have played in is any indication."

Helldivers,3cjwf4,rnewb,7,Wed Jul 8 16:51:51 2015 UTC,"Hello, so as someone who made one of those threads complaining about some aspects of one of the DLCs Id like to respond to your post:  1) A brilliant game. Yessir, I am not disagreeing on this at all.  2) Aside from the whole ""nothing is actually free"" stuff I agree with you. I am also very thankful to Arrowhead for doing such a great job.  3) Cheap DLC is entirely optional. I somewhat agree with you there. It is entirely optional and thats fine. I wouldnt call it cheap though because at this point we have already spent more than twice the initial purchasing price on DLC. Not saying it isnt worth it. But while every DLC individually is cheap, as a whole, it adds up quickly.   4 & 5) I am perfectly fine with how they are handling the community. In many ways its one of the best and friendliest ways ive ever seen a developer handle these things. So once again, good job Arrowhead!   So then why is everyone (used very inflationary here) getting riled up over the DLC? People will complain when they spend money on something and it doesnt live up to their expectations. Using the primary example of the Pistol Pack here, many people (including myself) had expected something different and are annoyed at how the pistols were handled as perks. And one thing I want to make very clear to those telling people NOT to complain: This is a VALID complaint. It doesnt matter how much stuff we got from the dev in the past, if I spend money on something and I feel it doesnt live up to its potential, I will point it out. Does that mean I wont support Arrowhead in the future? Absolutely not! I still have full confidence in them as a development team.   Oh and one more thing which few people seem to get: even complaints can be justified AND constructive! Sure there have been some bad posts here and there but whenever people have complained about something they have come up with potential ideas to fix them. This community is all in all a rather supportive one. But if a dev releases something which is in my eyes flawed or somehow falsely advertised (it was absolutely NOT clear that the pistols would be perks seeing as every other DLC weapon wasnt a perk), then it is in EVERYONES best interest that we talk about it and, if need be, criticise."
Helldivers,3cjwf4,metroid02,2,Wed Jul 8 16:37:11 2015 UTC,"Well said. I will continue to support, but I was disheartened to learn the pistols were a perk...to me, that is almost inherently useless to most players...and if it's useless, should it really be for sale? It just functions so different than the other DLC we have been used to that simply upgraded our gear by providing choice without sacrifice...the pistol perk requires sacrifice and it is very hard to think of situations where an upgraded pistol will be a better choice than one of the ""Big Three"" perks."
Helldivers,3cjwf4,ndhl83,2,Wed Jul 8 18:32:35 2015 UTC,"I like how you bash and whine without ever even trying out the perk. I like it personally. Upgrading gear without sacrifice is a really bad idea. And I've already posted, how useful the upgraded pistols are and in some of the situations in which they're useful, so quit being obtuse about it.  As for the grenade perks, I use stun all the time for cyborgs. I find them incredibly useful. If you can't play outside of your ""Big three"" perks (and there is actually only 2 by the way) then that's on you."
Helldivers,3cjwf4,TheLethalDiva,5,Wed Jul 8 18:42:41 2015 UTC,"Why would I try/adopt something that is clearly deficient? I tend to experiment when the choice is unclear. This is fairly clear. I know you think I am whining, but you are kind of white knighting this issue (and stun grenades) so maybe I am just playing devil's advocate? Your personal experience with your own loadouts notwithstanding, I am analyzing the situation from the context of ""What is most effective in most situations?"". I remain unconvinced by your well reasoned opinions. Switching out your perk for some custom pistols (or stun grenade) will almost always be a bad choice across the variety of situations you will find yourself in while Diving. So, that in mind, I can't help but see the pistol DLC (as a perk) as almost inherently useless in that it isn't likely to see play by a significant amount of players. I will happily admit to being wrong if that is the case once the dust settles, and apologize to both you (for being argumentative) and the Devs (for questioning their choice of implementation).  Of course I can play without them, it's not like we start with them, come on now. I wreck face with just a cape and a smile ;)  I was thinking Displacement, Strat Priority, and Cardio (makes 3). Cardio may be used more in solo runs, but it still gets heavy play. I know I won't be trading it on solo drops for different pistols."
Helldivers,3cjwf4,ndhl83,-3,Wed Jul 8 18:56:05 2015 UTC,"Cardio is mediocre at best. You almost never need to sprint in this game.  People like it, but honestly, like you said, unless you're doing solo speed runs its a total waste of a perk IMO.  And stun grenades are really good, especially with a re-supply pack. I'm stunned (pun intended) you can't see that."
Helldivers,3cjwf4,TheLethalDiva,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:10:15 2015 UTC,"It plays well for 2-man stealth approach as well. Auto-injector is the one I don't understand why people use (once they have displace, anyhow).  I like you. You are passionate. I hope perhaps we get a chance to play together some time. I think we might actually make good team mates, heh. Granted, I am assuming you like to play support a lot and don't mind not being the kill leader. I feel bad about myself when I don't kill the most enemies...somewhere on Super Earth orphans from all of our (incredibly well justified and absolutely necessary) offensive losses are crying because I didn't kill more bugs/borgs/squids."
Helldivers,3cjwf4,ndhl83,0,Wed Jul 8 19:27:58 2015 UTC,"That's pretty much how I feel. I don't know why anyone would use Auto-injector over Displacement Field.  And if you just have to have your auto-injector, then I would recommend trying stun grenades or the perk pistol flamethrower as those both will protect you on the ground, and they have their other uses. You will get back on your feet, if you have stun grenades and if your team mates don't push you off the screen."
Helldivers,3cjwf4,TheLethalDiva,2,Wed Jul 8 19:39:56 2015 UTC,"No one is bashing anything here. And, assuming this was directed at me, I do own the pistols and have tried them. Also, just because something is good in one or two situations doesnt make it good overall. Heck, even the autoinjector is good if youre on the ground. Ive found a good use for it yet its still a pretty useless perk. And thats how I feel about the pistols. The tradeoff is just not worth it, especially when the displacement field and strat priority are just so much more useful, especially on higher difficulties.  I agree that upgrading gear without sacrifice is a bad idea. To me however, the pistols are about one step in the right and two steps in the wrong direction."
Helldivers,3cjwf4,metroid02,5,Wed Jul 8 20:36:18 2015 UTC,"Hear, hear."
Helldivers,3cjwf4,themanfromsaturn,11,Wed Jul 8 14:20:00 2015 UTC,"I agree with all your points.  We are upset because we were not informed about our purchase. We assumed we were buying weapon unlocks because that is the reasonable assumption without any communication describing what we were actually purchasing.   It's not that hard to tell us what we are purchasing. Just tell us in the description of the DLC that we are purchasing perks. This is the same thing that happened with the first set of DLC. We assumed we were buying DLC, but we were in fact purchasing account entitlements. Arrowhead fixed that mistake. I hope they fix this one somehow.   It is misleading your customer into a purchase. It's the same problem as Bungie and their Destiny expansion packs. Most people assumed expansion meant more than three missions (considering the price). People sell ""pictures of consoles"" on ebay except those auctions will actually tell you in fine print that you are buying a ""picture of a console"" and not the console (and therefore it is your fault for not reading).   How can we make an informed purchase without them telling us what we are actually buying? Now we have to hold onto our money and wait for a reddit forum or a youtube video to tell us what we are actually buying before making a purchase, and we shouldn't have to do that.   Arrowhead just needs to communicate. It's not that hard. Just tell us what they are selling us (if it's outside of the normal precedent)."
Helldivers,3cjwf4,Drocktimus,11,Wed Jul 8 15:32:48 2015 UTC,"This is a very valid point, I'll look into changing the store description to clarify that they are perks."
Helldivers,3cjwf4,AHGS_Designer_Patrik,3,Wed Jul 8 16:13:29 2015 UTC,"That would certainly make a lot of potential purchasers better informed. I am glad I read the posts here before I just bought up the DLCs like usual.  That said: Can you speak to how often the alternate grenade strategems are used, and if that data/frequency really supported the implementation of pistols as perks? I have -literally- (and I am indeed being literal) never been in game, since launch, with a player using an alternate grenade strat. It has not happened. Once.  Don't you feel that is indicative of how often the pistol perk would be used? And with that in mind, doesn't that make a DLC you know people aren't even going to use kind of cash grab compared to the useful, easy to load out DLCs? I think that is where the resentment is coming from: You are selling a DLC that may be seen as useless once the nature of it using a perk slot is revealed.   Thank you for the interaction, and your continued efforts on this great game :)"

Helldivers,3cjwf4,Aeriq,2,Wed Jul 8 20:47:51 2015 UTC,$40 for 16GB is what I have. Not as much memory but is just enough to have a few bigger games you commonly play and the smaller niche games. Swapping an old game out here and there. I personally refuse to pay $80. That is ridiculous and absurd. There's no way it cost that much to make. New games are only $60. Sony should relax a bit.

Helldivers,3cjrhq,Grey--,3,Wed Jul 8 21:57:56 2015 UTC,tbf the new pistols are INSANELY powerful. I could literally use them as my main weapon. They make the railgun and camper worth using. If they added this you'd be pretty damn unstoppable with them on.
Helldivers,3cjrhq,ExOTiC1234,2,Thu Jul 9 01:08:34 2015 UTC,"I agree, its hard to stop using them, once you start. They open up alot of weapon combos and they really help with ammo management.

Helldivers,3cjrhq,TheLethalDiva,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:22:37 2015 UTC,i cant seem to use the FLAM pistol effectively at all though. Got any tips?
Helldivers,3cjrhq,ExOTiC1234,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:38:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, torch the enemies and run, they'll die from flame damage. When you use fire (and poison) weapons, its pretty much a cat and mouse game.  Flame throwers work best with stall. Poison also combos well with flame as the damage from the two different effects stack. They'll take damage from the poison and the flame and they won't be able to touch you because of moving so slow due to the poison's slowing effect.  Static Field works good, especially when combined with a force field so you can move freely. You can set them on fire and just back off while they burn to death."
Helldivers,3cjrhq,TheLethalDiva,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:52:34 2015 UTC,So its pretty bad against illuminates then right? Their shield blocks fire
Helldivers,3cjrhq,ExOTiC1234,2,Thu Jul 9 02:36:07 2015 UTC,"I don't know. I haven't used it against them yet. Should be good though. Fire is constant source of damage, if you look at the non-DLC stratagems, all the fire weapon/stratagems tear them up.  Hellfire bombs, flamethrower, Double Freeedom, the Obliterator. So I'd be surprised if it didn't work well against them."
Helldivers,3cjrhq,TheLethalDiva,4,Thu Jul 9 03:03:49 2015 UTC,"Yes, and I like Wiktorjor2001 idea of making it a lvl 29 reward. Being able to earn an extra perk box will allow us to use pistols or grenades. I'm hoping this is something that can be implemented with the game in an update."
Helldivers,3cjrhq,MadFlava76,5,Wed Jul 8 14:58:32 2015 UTC,As long as the second perk is resfricted to equipment. Otherwise some balance issues may be at hand.

Helldivers,3cjrhq,CaptainTruelove,2,Wed Jul 8 17:40:48 2015 UTC,"Given this is the #1 issue with the new content. I'll give my 5 cents as a software developer that enjoy this game so much.   This is a question to ArrowHead Team.  Wouldn't be an easier patch | update strategy to select your sidearm in the same way that you select variants of weapons? (sickle | tanto) given that:  1) Peacemaker belongs to weapons category, it can be upgraded, its assigned and replaceable if you select an SMG, so its selectable even if its in a private game mechanic.  2) So, merging pistols | sidearms to their own selectable category will free the perk selection.  TL;DR; Make pistols selectable as any other weapon to free perk slot and keep Helldivers happy and spread democracy with their favourite sidearm, weapon and perk combinations."
Helldivers,3cjrhq,argentounce,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:57:59 2015 UTC,"On a related/unrelated note, it'd be cool if the Helldive capes boosted your [insert stat here] if used against the same enemy.

Helldivers,3cjrhq,TheLethalDiva,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:59:29 2015 UTC,"I'd say the perk list is pretty even, tier-wise. With the right loadout those pistols and grenades might be as good or better than most of your other options.   You don't need survival perks as much as before with the more generous Low Death Count star, Displacement Field is very nearly more trouble than it's worth now. Stratagem Priority is useless if your loadout doesn't lean on spamming ammo drops or attacks ... while this has always been true it's even easier with some of the sweet new equipment."
Helldivers,3cjrhq,swagohod,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:07:35 2015 UTC,"If they are going to redo the loadout screen then they should make a weapon section: primary weapon, sidearm, & grenade; a perk section, & stratagem section.

Helldivers,3cjrhq,Drocktimus,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:36:27 2015 UTC,"Cardio is a second rate perk, IMO.  I just played a mission where 3 of 4 helldivers were using the new perk pistols and using their pistols over their primary weapons. Everytime I shot an Obelisk with Singe it died, one shot, one kill. It was excellent against cyborgs too. It complements the Railgun very well. Railgun takes out single threats, Singe handles the mobs.  And I would hardly call Stun Grenade, a 2nd tier perk. And I've seen some amazing gameplay from people using smoke grenades (even though I personally don't rate them as high as stun grenades)."

Helldivers,3clx5p,Sieghrain,2,Wed Jul 8 22:53:05 2015 UTC,"Jet packs, then anything anti tank. Also need one person with resupply pack. I ran out of jetpack fuel. Fight is kinda long, 10-20 mins.  Bugs and illuminate have mid armour. Primary weapons damages them when you hit the mouth of the boss. Illuminate is the area where it shoot out that leaser beam. I would pick weapons which you don't have to reload much or at all.  Cyborg boss is heavy armor. I don't know if primary weapon even hurts him but he is kinda of the easiest ( maybe it me). Boss drops the anti stratagem torrents, have to destroy. Boss is slow, so you do have time to destroy it and running to the other side to call down you fellow Helldiver's. Once the boss got trapped in the corner all we did is drop the triple thunder barrage. Boss like vehicle, so if trapped or turning around takes time, like our Helldiver APC and HAV.  One main rule is to always call down your fellow Helldiver."

The illuminate boss is the easiest and his attacks cant hurt you when you're in this thing. If its fully upgraded you can absolutely destroy him  Anti Tank Mines. Sooooo good.  Demolition Charges. Run up to the boss and drop all 5 charges then jetpack and detonate. Lots of damage.  Orbital laser and Railcannon. Self explantory  EAT-17. They are perfect for boss battles  Obliterator Grenade launcher. Absolutely wonderful weapon for battles. You can keep your distance and spray away  BUGS:   Railcannon  Demolition pack  Orbital Laser  Anti Tank  EAT  Obliterator Grenade Launcher  I havent fought the cyborg one yet, but im pretty sure the bug boss is definitely the hardest. He spams toxic  goop EVERYWHERE and he burrows in the ground and pops up and snatches you. Or he pops up and slides on his belly to eat you. Annoying as hell but rewarding to fight."
Helldivers,3clx5p,TheLethalDiva,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:46:40 2015 UTC,does the mines work on the bug boss it hides on the grounds while the illuminate boss is floating?
Helldivers,3clx5p,RugbyLou,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:17:39 2015 UTC,"They do but IMO their a nuisance more than a help. What happens is people coat the ground with mines. the Boss takes minimal damage from them, so what winds up happening is now you can't move freely because of the mines and it ends up getting team mates killed.  I think the razor wire is much better for the bug boss. But the main thing is not to step on people's toes or do anything that messes up their mobility."

This morning I used rail cannon strike and while it did good damage, I think Orbital Laser is better since it will take out multiple targets while doing damage to the boss. Next time I'm up against him, I'm going to bring Obliterator, Orbital Laser, Ammo, Jet Pack, Stratagem Priority, and Stalwart."
Helldivers,3cju2e,Lawdog87,2,Wed Jul 8 14:51:50 2015 UTC,"Pretty good loadout, but you could do a bit better with team planning. If you have a group I'd suggest having someone else bring the Jet Pack and the Obliterator for you and brining 3x Orbital Laser and an Ammo to go with your Stratagem priority. Then that person will likely end up bringing 2 Obliterators, Jet Pack, and Orbital Laser with Displacement field."

Helldivers,3cju2e,MadFlava76,2,Wed Jul 8 18:22:13 2015 UTC,"Healing against Illuminates works well. Running Angel makes it very hard for Illuminates to kill you, since most of the units don't one shot kill you like the other two factions tend to do.  Rep-80's work well too, but against the Illuminates I prefer to use the Obliterator for my secondary weapon. The Angel is going to give you all the health you need anyway.  The other easy way to kill the Illuminate boss is by running Commando Launcher's. Its super easy to beat him that way, especially with auto reload assists."
Helldivers,3clpu2,ShadowRaptor89,2,Wed Jul 8 21:56:00 2015 UTC,". this doesnt need ANOTHER post  . many people were discontent because we assumed the pistols would not take up perk slots because the other weapons we got werent perks, and they havent sold perks as DLC (and theres no perk that replaces your weapons)  . its caled criticism. Devs make mistakes, and now the devs are going to clearly outline that they are perks not weapons. Everyone here is most definitely thankful for the job Arrowhead has done but that doesnt mean they cant make mistakes  TL;DR stop acting like arrowhead cant make mistakes and that the people here are whining. We know we dont have to buy the DLC but we love the game so much and want to support the devs in evey way possible, its just unfortunate that it wasnt clear as to what we were getting.

Helldivers,3chiyh,metroid02,13,Tue Jul 7 23:20:38 2015 UTC,"Just my two cents,  Question to /u/ArrowheadGS  If there's enough demand would the developers consider making pistols their own equipment slot?  Perhaps Grenades as freely selectable as well?   These secondary weapons are fantastic things but perks like Displacement Shield or Stratagem Priority provide far more utility to us than an underwhelming off-hand flamethrower or off-hand cannon.   Unfortunately this means that while we love these new toys,  they will be relegated to ""screw around"" items that we take on milk runs when bored.   In light of this, please let us equip pistols and grenades the same way we pick our primary weapon, in this way we can modify our utility to the group without crippling our chances of survival."
Helldivers,3chiyh,CannabinoidAndroid,19,Wed Jul 8 03:16:56 2015 UTC,"Hello!   It's a good question and I will see if I can answer it.   We have always been adamant that we do not want to split the community with paid DLC. We want to game to be fair and playable to those who only purchased the base game. So the problem with making the pistols their own equipment slot is that people would possibly feel forced to buy the DLC - something that we do not want to do. We have always said the paid DLC is more cosmetic and for variation purposes, rather than to gain any in-game advantages.   We of course will consider all options if the community strongly request this, and as always discuss pros and cons of things like this, but some things we cannot or would not be able to implement."
Helldivers,3chiyh,ArrowheadGS,8,Wed Jul 8 07:55:53 2015 UTC,"Please make pistols and grenade types as equipment slots! There are so much better perks to choose from and grenade type as a perk is kind of boring, too.  Here are some ideas for perks to fill the empty space if you make the change:   Stronger melee  Duck and cover - replace cover with invincibility while holding the button  Lava and snow immunity Push button to selfdestruct when knocked down Make one lesser to mid tier enemy follow you"
Helldivers,3chiyh,AngryEye,5,Wed Jul 8 11:56:39 2015 UTC,"I'd suggest splitting perks into two slots, one slot would provide actual passive perks, the other one would provide the ""swap standard issue stuff for something else"" That way everyone could choose their passive perk like they do now, and everyone could swap grenades (which are used very rarely now) OR pistols, not both. Those without DLCs would still have at least three grenades, and in future updates you could add some more (maybe even free) pistol and grenade swap perks as level up rewards.  To be honest, I myself will probably never use the pistols. I bought the pack thinking there would be another way of swapping it, now I am a lil bit disappointed, but hell it was three or four bucks for a game that I truly love so I won't make noise about it. :) I'd just suggest looking for some solution to make them more useful, together with the grenade perks."
Helldivers,3chiyh,Slivovidze,4,Wed Jul 8 15:06:26 2015 UTC,"The community as a whole always assumed a sidearm pack would be introduced in the future as dlc. The base sidearm is plenty strong, and we do not mind paying for new optional weapon unlocks. Your pricing model is very generous.   I strongly feel that no one is going to kick someone from a group because of their sidearm. I want to reassure the arrowhead dev team of that.   It sounds like it is a lot of work, but if you can find the resources the game (which is already great) will be better for it if you expand our weapon kit choices. I think everyone wants to add side arm & grenade type to their loadout choices."
Helldivers,3chiyh,Drocktimus,7,Wed Jul 8 18:24:56 2015 UTC,"Easy fix: Implement 1, and only 1, alternate pistol for free that unlocks at 20+...laser pistol or some jazz. That way no one can say they don't have a choice in pistols and you can actually add more to the game in DLC.  No one is going to use the pistol ""variation"" if they have to give up a useful perk. I am scratching my head, wondering who thought making the new pistols a perk was a good idea? I mean, what does your internal data show about players using the grenade ""perks""??? LOL"

Helldivers,3chiyh,jophur,6,Wed Jul 8 01:08:46 2015 UTC,"Just bought it. Only used against the bugs so far. The new pistols seemed pretty solid, two of the three impressed me alot, just on the bugs so far. The pistol perk really helps with ammo management and is basically like having five stratagems, some may call that weak? We'll see...  The Flamethrower pistol was incredibly useful against bugs. And on the ground, its a very powerful weapon to have. might even be the best ground weapon in the game. Stun grenades being my favorite ground weapon, but since they don't deal damage, I consider them defensive, rather than offensive like the pyro pistol is. Its basically a one handed  level 1 flamethrower. Probably, my favorite of the three (so far) fire and poison mix very well together, so with the Paragon, Avenger or even a weapon with stun, this is good pistol to choose.  P-6 Gunslinger. Wow, this gun packs a punch. If you like using weapons like the Camper or the Punisher, then this is the pistol for you. One shot, one kill basically and you get a free laser sight. Like the flamethrower, you could feasibly do the whole helldive using only your perk pistol. I pretty much did tonight with bugs. Holds alot of ammo, its just a solid gun, and this will probably be the most popular of the three, I suspect. The only negative, is this gun and the flamethrower both have slower reload times compared to the standard default pistol, which against cyborg hounds is very important. I can't remember what the reload time was for the third gun ""Singe""  So the last gun Singe, sounds like a magic sword out of a fantasy novel like the Hobbit. It has pretty blue lighting effects, which look really cool. Against bugs it was my least favorite of the three, for several reasons. It was difficult hitting with it, not just because you need to be accurate, but also because the plasma fired from it travels slow. Very slow, so what would happen is, my team mates would kill the enemy before the pistol's plasma had a chance to hit its target. Also its not a weapon you want to fire close range, it explodes when it hits. This is not ideal for using against bugs, who like to rush. I suspect it will be much better against cyborgs and Illuminates though. It's meant for firing into crowds. So the fact that the shots explode make this a less than desirable gun for using when you're on the ground. When enemies are swarming you and you're trying to fight your way to your feet, the last thing you need is a gun firing explosive rounds. For fighting on the ground when surrounded by enemies, you're probably better off with the other two perk pistols or even the default one. But again this gun is meant for crowd control, so we'll see how it handles the other two factions."
Helldivers,3chiyh,TheLethalDiva,2,Wed Jul 8 08:19:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot for the review! I already ruled them out because they would take the slot of my beloved autoinjector, but now I'm actually really interested to try them!"
Helldivers,3chiyh,MBlovesTIX,6,Wed Jul 8 08:58:55 2015 UTC,"I heard from a friend that the reason for pistols taking the perk slot is that the interface actually took a ton of work and in order to change it to accommodate pistols it would require some serious work for many weeks.  I don't like it as much as anyone else, but it's not the end of the world guys."
Helldivers,3chiyh,snackpack42,2,Wed Jul 8 03:00:35 2015 UTC,Here's to hoping they make a second game with the option to choose your pistol and grenades without using a perk slot.

Helldivers,3chiyh,rube203,4,Wed Jul 8 08:17:53 2015 UTC,On the plus side: the vehicles are pretty fun to use (especially the bike). Though you have to upgrade it for the second guy to have a gun.
Helldivers,3chiyh,CannabinoidAndroid,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:13:09 2015 UTC,Also holeee-biscuits have you seen the drift that the bike gets? The damage from roadkilling is fantastic too.  I've used it to take out scout bugs before they could alarm.      Hard to use in a mixed setting though. It is something the team has to agree on ahead of time.   Bikes with on-foot is hard as you constantly have to loop around or end up pulling the camera way off of an objective.   Here's hoping the next DLC has a bike with Jump-jets.
Helldivers,3chiyh,TheLethalDiva,9,Wed Jul 8 03:07:10 2015 UTC,"Yup, really just tried it. Horrible decision. I guess that will make them about as useful as stun grenades etc..."
Helldivers,3chiyh,ndhl83,4,Tue Jul 7 23:27:58 2015 UTC,Actually Stun grenades is one of the best perks in the game.  Being able to stun an entire mob of enemies for 5 seconds. That seems pretty useful to me. Being able to freeze the enemies but only slow your team mates for 5 seconds. Being able to get up from the ground by throwing a stun grenade and freezing all enemies.  Seems pretty useful to me. I can only hope the pistols are as useful and as fun as Stun Grenades are.
Helldivers,3chiyh,TheLethalDiva,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:40:32 2015 UTC,"I find killing enemies significantly more effective that stunning them, when it comes to survival."
Helldivers,3chiyh,ndhl83,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:03:40 2015 UTC,"Stunning enemies helps do just that or escape them, whatever you want really.

Helldivers,3chiyh,TheLethalDiva,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:53:24 2015 UTC,"If I recall correctly from past posts, you tend to play medic in your groups.

I am a DPS player (though I do tank a bit in other games)."
Helldivers,3chiyh,ndhl83,2,Wed Jul 8 19:04:59 2015 UTC,"That is true, yes. And agreed for a medic, stun grenades are hard to beat. Although I can solo and 3 star helldives pretty easily with stun grenades.  I don't know if you're aware of this but the stun weapons are glitched in solo (they don't work on big enemies for solo but they do in group) games. The stun grenade is the only thing that actually does work for solo. So its good for escapes and it doubles as an auto injector for most enemies. Although a tank will ignore the stun and crush you, thats the only drawback it has compared to if you were using the auto injector perk."

Helldivers,3chiyh,jak_d_ripr,5,Wed Jul 8 00:50:29 2015 UTC,"I agree, it seems fair.  And honestly I'll probably pick up the Pistol Pack JUST TO GIVE ARROWHEAD MORE OF MY MONEY.  Arrowhead is doing more than Naughty Dog to decide the Sony/MS console question.  Why would you ever choose the system AHGS is not making games for?  But that said, I would always ALWAYS rather take Strat Priority over... well pretty much anything, but certainly over a new pistol.  What I am really really hoping is that we will see an expansion or patch down the line that lets us choose a SECOND PERK.  I cannot tell you how bad I want to try Strat Priority WITH Strong Arm.  ::drool::.  And at that point, you know, testing out stun grenades or a flame pistol starts to sound interesting."

Helldivers,3chiyh,CaptainTruelove,2,Wed Jul 8 03:43:35 2015 UTC,"It's not that big a deal. Makes sense they'd have to implement it this way since there wasn't a way to choose pistols before. Probably something to do with the way it was coded.  But I just tried each of the pistols out. They're actually pretty good. I really like the plasma pistol. They seem to be more of a novelty item than anything though. Something to play around with when you are tired of using the same old perks all the time. Definitely could be useful on missions where there's a lot of carrying to do, since the pistols are pretty powerful."

The handcannon is fun and does some good damage, the plasma is good for taking out bug and cyborg patrols and the flamer is not that great but fun but none of them are worth giving up a perk for. Also none of them are worth taking AT ALL on illuminate planets. Here is hoping that at some point Arrowhead makes it so the pistol is a separate equipment slot."
Helldivers,3chiyh,ExOTiC1234,2,Wed Jul 8 05:33:23 2015 UTC,The revolver is great on illuminate planets. Especially in conjunction with using a shotgun or smg. Use it against the snipers and it's a one shot kill.
Helldivers,3chiyh,Vahn_Magnus,2,Wed Jul 8 07:23:07 2015 UTC,"I don't know how else they would have implemented them.  As I see it, the gunslinger is a viable semi-primary weapon, with something like the rail gun in your primary slot, and a resupply pack on."
Helldivers,3chiyh,ExOTiC1234,4,Wed Jul 8 03:32:05 2015 UTC,WAIT WHAT? LOL IS THIS A JOKE? who in the fuck would think thats a good idea?
Helldivers,3chiyh,CjP1294,5,Wed Jul 8 00:02:15 2015 UTC,"Nah, no joke.  Shame I had to find out after putting money down.  The revolver has good power and a laser sight, but I find the other two to be a bit lackluster, and honestly, many people aren't going to give up their Displacement Field or Priority for these."

Helldivers,3chiyh,TheLethalDiva,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:11:49 2015 UTC,So it just replaces your regular peacekeeper but takes up a perk slot?  God that is probably the dumbest decision I've ever seen. Is it even possible for Arrowhead to change the DLC to be actual pistols that you upgrade and not perks? Because as of now Im super glad im waiting for the bundle (if there is one) because if i inpluse bought that I'd be so mad.  What a shame.
Helldivers,3chiyh,ndhl83,2,Wed Jul 8 00:15:59 2015 UTC,Exactly.  And yeah...now you know what i feel like...
Helldivers,3chiyh,TheLethalDiva,4,Wed Jul 8 00:41:28 2015 UTC,"Upvoted for awareness, this is a huge disappointment. Man I was so hyped to pick up that revolver but I'll have to stick to Displacement for now"
Helldivers,3chiyh,ndhl83,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:02:28 2015 UTC,"I've been thinking it over and I think a good compromise would be if someone is taking a pistol as a perk they should also be able to take a variant grenade, this would make it more viable for higher level planets."
Helldivers,3chiyh,TheLethalDiva,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:50:45 2015 UTC,Haven't used the new perk yet. But I figured it would be a perk.   How does it make sense? Well the advantage you're getting is extra firepower in the form of 1 of 3 new pistols. Makes perfect sense to me.
Helldivers,3chiyh,ndhl83,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:45:06 2015 UTC,Perfect sense to give up a significantly more useful strategic perk in exchange for an alternate pistol? How much time do you spend on the ground or carrying things?????
Helldivers,3chiyh,TheLethalDiva,0,Wed Jul 8 12:12:28 2015 UTC,"Your opinion. Having an alternate weapon that's as good as your primary, how is that not useful or strategic? How is stun grenades not useful or strategic? You don't need to run stratagem specialist/displacement field every mission."
Helldivers,3chiyh,Shiki-tianzi,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:03:52 2015 UTC,"Redundancy isn't often useful or strategic...why do I need a second weapon that's as good as my primary if my primary is as good as my primary? And why would I want to drop out build changing perk for this redundant second weapon that is, at best, maybe tied with my primary?"
Helldivers,3chiyh,fullmetalkarz,0,Wed Jul 8 18:42:08 2015 UTC,"Redundancy is useful. Shooting enemies is redundant, but it kills them. That is both useful and strategic. Having two primary weapons, means not having to depend on ammo as much. It means being able to handle long assaults easier. Having access to a flamethrower for a pistol is really good, especially if you're running poison/flame loadouts. I haven't found the ideal use for Singe yet, but like I said I'm fairly certain it will be good for cyborgs and illuminates. If you can't see how having two primary weapons isn't strong or gives you an advantage, I don't know what to tell you.  I could say stratagem specialist is redundant, all it does is let you use your stratagems 40% faster. ""How is that useful or strategic"" Just insulting a perk by calling it redundant doesn't make it any worse than it is. We all know how good stratagem specialist is."
Helldivers,3chiyh,Suicidal_Ferret,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:01:46 2015 UTC,"Shooting (at) enemies after they are dead is redundant. Shooting them while alive is not redundant...it is quite useful.  I don't think anyone could make a well reasoned argument that Strat Priority is redundant. Not without abusing the meaning of redundancy. It almost doubles the rate at which you can cast strats...that's a lot of extra rail strikes, static fields, etc. A lot."
Helldivers,3chiyh,fullmetalkarz,0,Wed Jul 8 19:15:32 2015 UTC,"Exactly, that's what I'm saying. You got two guns to shoot the enemies dead with, you also got 2 reliable guns to make combos with. And the perk pistols are all unique. The six shooter is pretty standard you could say, but it gives you the bonus of having a laser sight, and its a strong weapon, it really is.  I really don't see the perk pistols as being useless or redundant, I really don't."
Helldivers,3chiyh,Suicidal_Ferret,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:33:16 2015 UTC,"A huge disappointment for me... pistol can not compare to primary weapon,so why should i give up a perk to get a new pistol?"

Helldivers,3cicw5,ArrowheadGS,3,Wed Jul 8 08:12:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah I've noticed bugs like that as well.  Just did a helldive mission where there was a Defend the Launch thing. To two of us, it didn't look like the mission was working at all when we tried to activate it, but one of the other guys said it was counting down on his screen.  So we completed it, but it still didn't look complete to me. We ran the rest of the way through the mission, went to extract, and as soon as the ship was landing, the game crashed.  The mission before that, everyone extracted out fine. The mission report even showed everyone as having extracted. But we didn't get the star for it.  The latest update definitely introduced some bugs."
Helldivers,3cicw5,i_am_a_genus,2,Wed Jul 8 04:32:39 2015 UTC,I got this last night. The shuttle was invisible and me and a squad mate could run right through where it ought to be. The other two squad mates disappeared when they walked into where the shuttle should have been. No extraction bonus :<
Helldivers,3cicw5,StilRH,1 point,Wed Jul 8 07:31:00 2015 UTC,"This happened to me yesterday as well on the PS3 client, probably every 3rd or 4th game; I didn't experience the issue of missing dropships or running straight through them, but had multiple successfully completed and full extracted games where the star wasn't awarded.  It's almost like a penalty for making the 3rd star so much easier to achieve now :)  Edit: added client"
Helldivers,3cicw5,mattlikesbeer,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:30:28 2015 UTC,I'm still not clear on how the 3rd star is achieved with the new update.

Helldivers,3cfyjd,ArrowheadGS,15,Tue Jul 7 16:43:01 2015 UTC,"Changed how the low death count works. Your team can now die as many times as the difficulty of the mission and still receive the low death bonus.    This is going to be wonderfully disruptive. :)  This makes the third star much more achievable on the hardest difficulties which makes influence gathering in Helldive difficulty much more viable. Even if it's almost too easy, which I'm sure will be the criticism, I'm for it."
Helldivers,3cfyjd,nitz__,9,Tue Jul 7 17:08:14 2015 UTC,"Too easy, IMO. But lets look at the positives of the new change.  1) It encourages people to play group games as opposed to solo. Solo you have limits to how many times you die, with a group you don't. The high death count encourages you to play with other people, which is really what the game is about.  2) It encourages you to play higher levels of difficulties. A long standing argument people like to make is why play level 12 over level 9 or even level 6. Well now you definitely have a reason, 3 to 6 extra deaths which with a good team, getting the low death count should be pretty easy.   Also with the new bosses and needing 50 points to play them per region. That's going to encourage players to do more Helldives and team play. Of course you could still just grind level 3 missions all day, but I imagine that would get tedious.  So some exciting changes, and while I'm a little leery, I do get why they were made. And I think its probably a good thing for the game."
Helldivers,3cfyjd,TheLethalDiva,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:38:44 2015 UTC,"It might be too easy, I haven't tried it yet, but the way it was before was too difficult, albeit maybe more satisfying to earn. I think that the same number of deaths as the difficulty is maybe too many, but its definitely a step in the right direction. I originally thought that have equal or fewer deaths per helldiver would be fair, but it's a hard thing to balance out."
Helldivers,3cfyjd,AS14K,2,Tue Jul 7 18:53:18 2015 UTC,"Its much more generous than most people were asking for. I think most players would have been happy with it just returning to 1 Host death being allowable, or 1 death per player.  But it does make it more appealing to play higher difficulties now and play with other people. So I think its probably a good thing."
Helldivers,3cfyjd,TheLethalDiva,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:06:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm not gonna lie, this does make me want to try slightly harder difficulty runs so I don't feel bad about dying 20 times. When I think about average deaths per run since I've been playing, on the harder difficulties (9ish) I would honestly say we average 8-12 deaths, so this number actually seems reasonable and achievable?"
Helldivers,3cfyjd,AS14K,4,Tue Jul 7 19:17:43 2015 UTC,So does this mean level 6 dive means 6 deaths per team?
Helldivers,3cfyjd,PizzaSnake,4,Tue Jul 7 17:08:39 2015 UTC,"Yes, the mission difficulty is how many times you can die now and still get the 3rd star."
Helldivers,3cfyjd,TheLethalDiva,2,Tue Jul 7 17:33:21 2015 UTC,"The REP-80 feels a lot slower with the turning radius or is it just me?    Also, congrats to the developers for this patch.  I grinded influence points on the bug planets, only to get completely stomped once I faced the boss.  I'm still trying to find the most effective means of getting through it.  Landmines have been useful in creating a ""safe zone"" to retreat to.  Tesla Coils as well.  EAT's have been the safest way to deal damage to the bug boss"
Helldivers,3cfyjd,robothorror,2,Tue Jul 7 23:39:14 2015 UTC,"Oh my god, that last patch note.  Really stellar update you made, Arrowhead!  I'm hoping for more objective types in the next update, and maybe another gameplay system or two.    Could you try adding Dungeons?  You already have the randomness.  You just need to create an unexplored section of the map and start the players at the entrance/edge.  Place one or two objectives inside and you're done.  Of course there would either have to be more than one entrance/exit or slightly reduce the number of spawns just outside, due to chokepoints being an issue.  Another variant on the extraction beacon could be fun.  Rather than staying to defend, you'll have to visit and activate waypoints scattered around the zone.  Fight while fleeing, like the Convoy objective."

I think it will be a good stratagem for Cyborg and Illuminates (I need to play with it more though). I think because of the double use its good for maximizing loadouts with a friend. And also the dual use means if your random team mates leave your gear behind, you got a back up.  You don't need the normal shield to stop hounds. If you're using a bayonet weapon or a breaker, you'll be fine. I just shoot dogs with a railgun usually, their not much of a threat as long as you don't need to reload when their attacking. If you do, just switch to the pistol or run in circles and they won't be able to touch you.  It was decent I'd say. Doesn't replace the force field, but its solid."
Helldivers,3ciotf,TheLethalDiva,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:17:21 2015 UTC,"Dogs are no problem if you see them coming, it's those times where you're trying to destroy a warlord or an IFV and they blindside you.

Helldivers,3ciotf,murdok1691,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:03:01 2015 UTC,That sounds really cool. I also like the anti-tank turret. The whole entrenchment pack brings some really great hardware.

Also I've yet to see one destroyed, so I'm not sure. Its strong though, it basically becomes like a environmental obstacle once you call it down. It only has 5 uses though, that's its biggest downside, but still, its really good.  You can't heal the anti-tank turret or the helldiver whose manning it. I think that might be a glitch, but I'm not sure though."
Helldivers,3ci00a,CatuThyme,5,Wed Jul 8 01:40:08 2015 UTC,"Solo influenced. Once you gather 50 influence you can go on the planet of the boss. Once you start the assault, you must beat the boss in 3 hours, kinda like a community defense. Each person has different planets and names for the bosses. Once you beat it you get 150 influence no matter how many stars you get. Then it generates a different planet and you need to gain the 50 influence over and over.  This was a great idea, because people are more inclined to get more stars to try the boss battles. It they succeed, they get +200 influence. Thats a huge amount of influence and wars will go more smoothly."
Helldivers,3ci00a,ExOTiC1234,4,Wed Jul 8 01:47:27 2015 UTC,"Its also important to note, you don't get the 150 influence added to your influence totals, only the community totals.  Which means players who aggressively try to top the leader boards, probably won't want to mess with doing them much, other than to get the initial trophies."

Helldivers,3cfe5k,TheLethalDiva,2,Wed Jul 8 08:23:42 2015 UTC,"I hate when people say this, because it doesn't make sense. The perk pistols are superior to your normal gun, so why would anyone use the default pistol if you could pick your pistol?  People say this with perk grenades as well, but again the perk grenades are just too strong to do that. If you could pick your grenade, 98% would choose stun grenades, because of how powerful they are and the fact you can't have accidents with them. Flame grenades are great as well for closing off choke points. And even Smoke grenades are incredibly useful in tricksy ways. Watch Totorox play, one of the objectives is automatic if you use smoke grenades, the cube one, where you enter codes, I can't remember the name of it right now. You could be in a mob of enemies, but they won't attack if the area is smoked, its pretty impressive, although its the hardest of the 3 grenades to use, IMO. Its for stealth play, something most players are bad at.  The game would be totally busted if Arrowhead ever decided to change the loadout to accommodate perk pistols and perk grenades. That or they would have to be seriously nerfed to make it work in a balanced way."
Helldivers,3cfe5k,Dredd907,1 point,Wed Jul 8 08:40:59 2015 UTC,"Because it's stated that these new 'pistols' are part of a 'pistol' pack and it would only make sense that they replace your standard issue sidearm the peacemaker. If you read the PS store description that's what it says.  But it wasn't implemented that way because the menu system would have to be recoded to allow a new slot that allows us to change our sidearm. For whatever reason, it seems they haven't implemented that and decided to put it in the perk slot - maybe for the time being and then possibly make changeable sidearm slots (and maybe even grenade slots) in the future. Perhaps if there is enough community interest and demands for this, the devs will make these changes."
Helldivers,3cfe5k,syncpulse,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:06:08 2015 UTC,"I agree with you in that the store description could have been more clear.   I'm not arguing about whether they could or couldn't it. Clearly it would require work on their part and changes to the game. What I'm saying is it would be a terrible idea to do it. The perk pistols and perk grenades are too powerful in comparison to the default pistol and grenade to make it work.  Again, the reason Arrowhead made them perks, is because they're improvements over the default versions of the weapons you normally get."

Helldivers,3cg553,TheLethalDiva,4,Tue Jul 7 17:46:07 2015 UTC,"I'll build onto this. I have it for PS4 and use matchmaking, and it's just superb. I also play on vita, but most of the time I'm playing solo due to no connectivity.     Playing solo as you get to the higher difficulty levels, I feel like you're pigeon-holed into using certain weapons/equipment/strategems. Now that's not a design flaw in my eyes, it's just how the difficulty curve kind of forces you to use better suited equipment because no one else is there to carry it.     Either way though, the game play is phenomenal and you can play all difficulties solo.    For the price, it is really worth it."
Helldivers,3cg553,Blues_Drive,3,Tue Jul 7 19:28:07 2015 UTC,"I actually solo quite a bit and it is an awesome feeling to beat a tough planet alone. Even though multiplayer is more fun/adds loadout flexibility, lack thereof is not a deal killer at all.  Join us, Citizen!"

Helldivers,3cg5ua,TheLethalDiva,0,Tue Jul 7 18:34:07 2015 UTC,"No, they're there.  PSN shop has posted new DLC content, but only as singles for the moment. Keep in mind though, that's what Sony did last time. I recommend you wait till they post the inevitable bundle, which I believe last time took them an extra day or two to do. At least for the PS3, I think PS4 owners got theirs right away."
Helldivers,3cg5ua,CrystalNRick,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:35:23 2015 UTC,I believe that Arrowhead had posted on there site that the last 2 times that the reinforcement packs 1-2 would have a bundle and this time around they did not not post any news on a reinforcement pack 3 bundle and the ps4 did have the bundle available when they first released it in store. My other worry is that they have yet to release the weapon pack dlc for purchase which I hope that they didn't make an exclusive to the helldiver ultimate edition only.
Helldivers,3cg5ua,TheLethalDiva,0,Tue Jul 7 18:48:50 2015 UTC,"Alot of people are saying their afraid there won't be a weapon pack DLC. Even Arrowhead doesn't seem to know the answer to that. Their advice was to complain to Sony about it if it happens.  My advice would be to complain to Sony about the weapon pack dlc if we don't get it (although I suspect we will, it will probably be sold separately).  If the weapon pack is a ultimate edition helldiver exclusive (which I cannot imagine). Then you could let Sony know you won't be buying the new DLC, until the new weapon pack is made available to us. Because if it is an exclusive, that's bullshit. I know the developers probably can't do anything about it or even comment directly on it(since they work for Sony), but yeah it would be total bullshit.  Still when you consider they could charge 3 bucks or whatever for it, it just wouldn't make sense for them not to release it as a DLC at some point."
Helldivers,3cg5ua,CrystalNRick,0,Tue Jul 7 18:59:46 2015 UTC,"I was hoping they would release the weapons pack when the new edition comes out, but if they do not and there are new players rocking new weapons I dont have access to, sony will be hearing from me."
Helldivers,3cg5ua,AS14K,2,Tue Jul 7 19:12:10 2015 UTC,"Right? That's a complete Destiny move, which got absolutely torn apart when they announced it, I couldn't imagine they'd try and do the exact same thing immediately afterwards."
Helldivers,3cg5ua,AS14K,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:47:57 2015 UTC,"At this point, it would be cheaper to buy the special edition, than it would be for me to buy the DLC packs, and I already bought all of the ones from the first pack. Is this how it's supposed to be? It doesn't really make too much sense as far as I'm concerned."
Helldivers,3cg5ua,TheLethalDiva,2,Tue Jul 7 20:52:55 2015 UTC,"Well first of all, the game has been out for a few months, so if the physical copy was cheaper, it would be understandable, IMO.  But speaking of the price. How do you even know what the price for the physical copy is going to be? I see alot of people complaining about  it, but they don't even know what the price is going to be yet. If its 50 or 60 bucks, is it really a better deal than buying the game the way we bought it? Its probably going to come out to be around the same price, I suspect.  More concerning to me though, is the ""exclusive"" weapons you get by buying it. But again, we don't know just yet, if that will be made available to all of us or not, but it should. If its not, its a horrible move on Sony's part. Both in the fact it would really hurt player morale and it would be a wasted opportunity for getting more money from us, as I'm sure most would buy it, so long as its fairly priced as past DLC has been. I suspect it will be like past editions, where what they mean is if you buy it now, you don't pay for the weapons pack. Similar to how the Ranger pack was for the original game, and the free DLC they gave you for the Turning up the Heat expansion. Not a big deal for me to have to buy it, I just want it available for me to get.  All I'm saying is it would be wise for us to wait till we know the facts, before we start criticizing."
Helldivers,3cg5ua,AS14K,3,Tue Jul 7 21:35:17 2015 UTC,"I could have sworn that I read the physical copy was the same price as the original was, so $20, but it's absolutely possible I just read something wrong. I definitely retract my point about it being cheaper (potentially), but, the whole situation seems a little uncertain, so I suppose we'll just have to wait till everything's been announced and finalized."

Helldivers,3celqw,puckvirus,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:53:16 2015 UTC,"Question to the devs, /u/ArrowheadGS, do you have any solution or work around for this problem for us Vita users with only a 4Gb memory card? (in my situation I got no other content loaded on it but helldivers and i'm still around 200mb shy of the 1387)"
Helldivers,3celqw,ArrowheadGS,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:29:13 2015 UTC,"Nothing we are looking into right now, sorry :("
Helldivers,3celqw,CaptainTruelove,2,Thu Jul 9 07:35:38 2015 UTC,God damn do they do a good job! Arrowhead is amazing!
Helldivers,3celqw,Thatwashardwork,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:36:47 2015 UTC,Is there dlc alongside this?
Helldivers,3celqw,ExOTiC1234,5,Tue Jul 7 09:08:57 2015 UTC,Yes and will be release ~4 hours from now i think
Helldivers,3celqw,Wiktorjor2001,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:47:28 2015 UTC,Omfg
Helldivers,3celqw,robothorror,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:11:41 2015 UTC,4.246 GB (4246 MB) on the PS4
Helldivers,3celqw,4rindam,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:05:26 2015 UTC,"Man,the updates just keep getting bigger and better."
Helldivers,3celqw,menamaks,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:27:33 2015 UTC,I can't find the DLC on the PS Store?
Helldivers,3celqw,ArrowheadGS,2,Tue Jul 7 14:37:08 2015 UTC,Depending on your region it may take a little while for the store to update :)
Helldivers,3celqw,ExOTiC1234,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:38:49 2015 UTC,"hey, dont tell my wife but i love you :)"
Helldivers,3celqw,ArrowheadGS,2,Tue Jul 7 14:39:49 2015 UTC,You should get her to spread some love and democracy too! :O
Helldivers,3celqw,murdok1691,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:43:29 2015 UTC,The NA store has not published yet.  Give it 4-8 hours.
Helldivers,3cfo5z,ExOTiC1234,2,Tue Jul 7 15:29:33 2015 UTC,"Pretty cool. Basically a huge bullet sponge, but it's cool that it mixes the game up just a little more. Excited to see future expansions to the game that go beyond enemy types and stratagems."
Helldivers,3cfo5z,PizzaSnake,2,Tue Jul 7 16:28:45 2015 UTC,Shield seems to be very helpful in case of the bug monster.Lots of poison.
Helldivers,3cfo5z,4rindam,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:58:12 2015 UTC,Yep i lost my shield though lol! Died too many times
Helldivers,3cfo5z,superbleeder,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:59:13 2015 UTC,I was still getting slowed through my shield =/
Helldivers,3cfo5z,Wiktorjor2001,2,Wed Jul 8 10:46:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks for video, helped me kill the boss, only used the judgement instead."
Helldivers,3cfo5z,themanfromsaturn,2,Tue Jul 7 17:44:36 2015 UTC,"I prescribe anti-tank mines, and lots of 'em."
Helldivers,3cfo5z,4rindam,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:48:37 2015 UTC,It'll be tough using them though.Since you cannot stand at one place and wait for boss or its minions to come at you and have to always be at move.Without jetpack it is very possible we will be the victims of our own mines.  It really becomes tough once the boss has only 1/4 th of his life left as  tank starts spawning.
Helldivers,3cfo5z,themanfromsaturn,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:15:18 2015 UTC,"The minefields aren't hard to traverse. I'd run shield, displacement field, tanto, demolishers, and 2x anti tank mines. Even if I step on one of my own mines, I'd have a couple layers of defense against them.  I run tanto and demolishers on bug helldives all the time and just clown wave after wave of them. I'm looking forward to giving it a try."
Helldivers,3cfo5z,4rindam,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:07:07 2015 UTC,Your loadout will definitely help you but the reason i was saying that mines could be way more dangerous here than any regular helldive is because of the small map size.  Yeah but there is no harm in trying infact it'll be a fun loadout but i think it will not be the most effective.
Helldivers,3cfo5z,themanfromsaturn,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:27:40 2015 UTC,"Well, I haven't tried it yet, so you may well be right.  what do you find effective?"
Helldivers,3cfo5z,4rindam,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:00:54 2015 UTC,"Only played one match against the Bug boss,All of my party had EAT and C4 charges so i took ammo and 2x jumpack and shredder.won in the first try.but there were a lot of deaths involved,almost everybody died 10 times.  The poison that the boss spits is very deadly and at the end the tentacle tank and brood commander starts spawning so jumpack definitely helps.  We were spamming EAT's at the boss all the time.There was always some EAT's lying on the ground.It was very disorganised everybody was spamming Eat,c4 and just jumping.I was surprised to see that we had very few accidentals only 4-5.  But it was very fun and challenging."
Helldivers,3cfo5z,themanfromsaturn,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:09:49 2015 UTC,"C4 definitely seems like the way to go. It's a shame the bloody bug won't hold still long enough to get hit with a thunderer barrage, but on the flip side, it moves around so much I figure it will plow into a lot of mines. Can it get stuck in a stasis field?"
Helldivers,3cfo5z,4rindam,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:06:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah,the mines can work that way.I don't think stasis will affect the bug boss.Not tried though.But if it does then we could do some heavy damage to it."
Helldivers,3cfo5z,monkey-bones,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:36:21 2015 UTC,i wanna watch this but want to play it first before watching it to get the full surprise of the new-ness
Helldivers,3cfo5z,MadFlava76,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:06:14 2015 UTC,"Just finished a bug boss battle. The team deployed a several EATs and we used them to take down the boss. I think I'll try using the shield, EATs, maybe C4 the next time."
Helldivers,3cfo5z,4rindam,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:40:23 2015 UTC,"Same here,4 helldivers and 2 of them had EAT as al of their strats and another had 4 Satchel charges.Using C4 is tough since the boss never really sticks at one place for long time but it definitely helps in killing the other enemies."
Helldivers,3chw41,smallfoot181,4,Wed Jul 8 01:07:51 2015 UTC,"I like the new deaths cap for the star. It sure got annoying when you try your hardest not to die until an ally ended up dropping on you or dropping something on you. Now for defense events, I can die a few times in a Helldive yet still be able to contribute more than I could from an easier difficulty."
Helldivers,3chw41,Soupkitten,3,Wed Jul 8 02:07:20 2015 UTC,Plus I love playing Helldives. Now I can have fun and be efficient.
Helldivers,3chw41,They_call_me_OP,2,Wed Jul 8 03:19:03 2015 UTC,"Its only 3 deaths per person, on a hell dive shit can happen, alot of shit, it just rains shit, and then you have to eat the shit or die, 12 is fair, it takes a while to build up a tolerance to that much shit. But veterans will be howling at the moon like always, plus you still have to grind samples for upgrades maybe the dlc upgrades should start at 3 research points and go up and all the o.g. weapons are still great for the game, plus the new retail version gives you the dlc included if i'm not wrong."
Helldivers,3chw41,derangedsky,2,Wed Jul 8 14:27:58 2015 UTC,"I'd really like to see some more level rewards. Arrowhead is always saying they don't want to separate the community with DLC. Increasing the level cap and giving the whole community a new weapon or perk with each wave would be a nice way to give everyone something potentially game changing where they don't have to worry about giving people who purchased the DLC an advantage. Additionally, leveling up currently takes a long time to do, so it could be something impactful, like a controlled teleport perk that replaces square or something cool like that."
Helldivers,3chw41,Lawdog87,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:34:47 2015 UTC,how much u paid for the game and how many further free rewards/contents u want from it?  u would still be unhappy if new weapons are free but new contents (like enemy masters) charges you 3usd
Helldivers,3chw41,kkuubboo,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:03:26 2015 UTC,"Just to clarify, I could care less if it was free or not. I just feel that the earning something provides some sort of gratification or sense of accomplishment that motivates a player base to continue playing.   I have played through all of the times of greater inactivity largely because I want the game to have continued success even when the mechanics are not motivating players who have gotten all they can get and opt to sit out when it gets down to cyborgs only or something like that.  And I have bought every DLC to this point (except the pistols) twice over which puts me at about nearly 50 usd spent on DLC content, so I can safely say my concerns are not some roundabout way of complaining about the cost. I support the game because it is a quality game, and where I get disappointed is when simple things can be done to increase activity and ultimately, benefit the developers of the game which has a cyclical effect as it comes full circle to improve their capacity to develop the game further."
