Fencing,3e5smo,motyatucker,6,Wed Jul 22 07:14:03 2015 UTC,"Stole a fantastic shot, but saved us 5 minutes of Baldini standing there looking incredulous, turning to his coach looking incredulous, looking back, pacing around like he can't believe this could happen to him, arguing with the ref without actually asking for video, looking as his coach again, turning back, throwing his hands up in the air, dropping them to his side, walking to his back line, and then finally asking for video."

Fencing,3e5smo,Situis,1 point,Wed Jul 22 07:08:22 2015 UTC,Could you explain? I thought it was attack in prep to left as there was no extension from Baldini?
Fencing,3e5smo,DOOFUS_NO_1,2,Wed Jul 22 12:55:00 2015 UTC,"He stops. Extension and movement from the left just stop. Baldini picks up on that, and gets the timing perfect."
Fencing,3e5smo,Situis,2,Wed Jul 22 13:38:14 2015 UTC,I see the stop before the final lunge and I guess that's where he loses priority?
Fencing,3e5smo,DOOFUS_NO_1,1 point,Wed Jul 22 14:06:43 2015 UTC,Yep. Key thing is that it's the stop of the extension of the arm.

Fencing,3e5smo,white_light-king,2,Wed Jul 22 14:26:53 2015 UTC,he's clearly starting an attack.  Refs don't just stare at the arm and nothing else.
Fencing,3e5smo,venuswasaflytrap,1 point,Wed Jul 22 14:54:18 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say that's the key thing. It's probably more fair to say that holistically speaking, he stops attacking."

Fencing,3e6vap,Fiasko1,2,Wed Jul 22 12:22:40 2015 UTC,"A feint to me had to do with an extention.  Unless your opponent is very intimidated by you or has some bad havits, you can't expect to fient every touch.  You have to find a balance where it is believable to your opponent and they react to it.  Where you feint to depends on where you plan to hit and what action you want to draw out of them.    Example:  Fencing a tall dude we move around, he gets a little too close and I fleshe his shoulder.  he tried to counter but i was ahead on the footwork and just my light.  I notice he really likes to counterattack (a lot of tall people do).  I fient with a half lunge and half extention, he tries to counter but i haven't fully committed yet, now I fleshe through his extended blade with a parry of my choice.    Another example:  opponent is super defensive but doesn't have the best footwork.  Feint to the hand then drop to the foot."
Fencing,3e6vap,justin107d,1 point,Wed Jul 22 14:37:21 2015 UTC,"Any feint will work, you just have to make it look believable with a full extension and the right footwork, advances or partial lunges.  Here's a video of a feint disengage in foil.  All weapons are connected, so the idea is the same.  Fake an attack in one spot, wait for the parry and disengage it, then follow through with the attack.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_XJqjCe_rY  It's slightly different in epee, with so much more target area than foil, so you have more options.  Feint to the outside arm then wait for the opponent's parry to open up target on their shoulder.  It's very easy with a disengage to circle up into a bind from that point.  You just have to know what action you want to draw from your opponent, then go from there."
Fencing,3e6vap,green_rave,1 point,Wed Jul 22 15:15:06 2015 UTC,full extension   I would almost never suggest a feint should be made with full extension in foil.
Fencing,3e6vap,venuswasaflytrap,1 point,Wed Jul 22 15:16:47 2015 UTC,"I didn't say they were exactly the same, just all connected.  I'm also a sabrist, not a foilist.  Could you explain to me why?  In sabre, literally everything is full extension.  [Edit] The original post was about epee, anyway.  No full extension in epee means painful-as-all-getout track marks on the inside of your elbow."
Fencing,3e6vap,green_rave,1 point,Wed Jul 22 15:19:37 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't do it in Sabre either, but I don't really fence sabre, so there could be concerns that I'm not aware of.  First off, I don't think people really react to a blade extending. In foil especially, your opponent is not going to be at a distance where they can touch with an extension without any footwork. If they are they're already really close, and I would be panicking regardless of where their hand was.  The hand can move, and change positions very quickly, but the body has to get into range in a more predictable way. I think people watch the body more, and maybe the large muscle groups, like the shoulder, as their visual cues for what's coming.   If you're in lunging distance of a decent fencer (outside extension), and you suddenly lock your arm straight, without any sort of body movement - or indication that you're going to lunge, they're probably not going to react, or even if they do, they won't react much. On the other hand, you can make a body feint, and even pull your arm back suddenly while leaning forward slightly, and often you can make someone panic.  And even ignoring the effectiveness of the feint, do you really want to be delivering the final movement of your touch with your feet only? The longer your arm is fully extended, the longer your opponent has to easily pick up your blade (or stop cut your arm in sabre).   Surely, in most cases, you want to come into touching distance with your feet somehow, and coordinate your hand so that your extension is timed such that you finish your extension at the very moment that your in extension distance. That way you're delivering your point with both your hands and your feet, rather than your feet pushing your locked arm forward. This way your blade spends less time in a place where your opponent can pick up a parry. Also, you only commit your hand to a specific line at the time you can touch - of if something happens you still have the ability to adjust where and how you place your tip (or cut in sabre)."
Fencing,3e6vap,venuswasaflytrap,1 point,Wed Jul 22 15:35:13 2015 UTC,"The biggest concern I always have with the point weapons is aim.  You can't aim well if you're still extending while you're lunging.  Your extension has to be finished before your lunge starts, or else you're trying to hold a point in space still while your whole body is moving.  And again, in epee (as the original post was asking about), if you don't have a full extension when your footwork starts, you get caught right on the inside of your elbow almost every time."

If you're missing gear, someone will lend it to you.  If you make a mistake, people will explain it to you.  New fencers are always welcome at decently run local events.  Local tournaments are not the high stakes, semi-cutthroat affairs national level events are.  Start at the askfred website and search for tournaments near you.  An U rated event or E&under would be ideal, don't be afraid to go to an open event or something with a higher rating either.  If your equipment is lacking, send an email or call the host of the tournament, and ask if you can borrow things at tournament ahead of time.  Lastly, Three years is a long time to fence without thinking about attending a tournament.  Your club is probably not tournament oriented and that's not a good thing for a young fencer.  In the ideal situations the coach and more experienced fencers will take you under their wing and help you attend a tournament.  If there are other Fencing clubs in your area, you might consider switching.  If there aren't many options, you should ask your coach about how to get the club more tournament oriented."

Fencing,3e15pz,someguyonthiswebsite,8,Tue Jul 21 03:58:41 2015 UTC,"Frankly, I think you might want to check out HEMA or classical fencing. Modern fencing is a lot different from the martial art of sword fighting. It's more tactically based and less physically based. There's no real body contact in fencing, for example. I'd check out some videos of both HEMA and fencing, maybe go to clubs for both, then decide."
Fencing,3e15pz,hardwaregeek,11,Tue Jul 21 04:22:37 2015 UTC,"I would put money on the best fencers in the world having way higher levels of athleticism than the best HEMA practitioners (e.g. Vo2 max, relative strength, probably absolute strength, beep test etc)."
Fencing,3e15pz,venuswasaflytrap,5,Tue Jul 21 06:58:45 2015 UTC,"As a HEMA practitioner, I couldn't agree more. The physical demands in sports fencing and, say, longsword, are obviously very different, but there's no doubt that the best sports fencers have reached a much higher level at what they do, both tactically, technically and physically, than the best longsword fencers.    There are many reasons for this, but three big ones are:     Tradition - HEMA is a relatively new pursuit, and people have been sort of trying to figure out WTF to do, many times more or less in a vacuum. In sports fencing there's a long lineage of very competent people refining and passing on what they've been taught by other very competent people. Size - As it is in any well-established sport, the competitive pressure in sports fencing is much higher than in a small sport like HEMA. I assume there's probably not a single ""top"" sports fencer in the world, and even if there is, there's dozens of people working their asses off for the chance to take his place. In HEMA, someone like Axel Pettersson can dominate in multiple weapons simply because the gap down to the next guy is too big. Start age - I don't know the average age a highly ranked sports fencer started fencing, but there's no doubt it's much younger than even the top ranked HEMA pracitioners.   Edit: this is of course the current state of things. I have faith that as HEMA grows we'll see a more and more even field technically, tactically and physically, and we'll reach a situation where no-one who wants to remain competitive can neglect either of the three aspects, regardless of which weapon they prefer. We're already seeing it starting to happen in the longsword, but the other weapons are currently lagging behind."
Fencing,3e15pz,g2petter,3,Tue Jul 21 11:07:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah for sure, and all of these things are just natural effects of HEMA's immaturity with regards to it's process of sportification.  I really want someone to start a longsword club that intentionally tries to the game the rules. One that willfully ignores the 'spirit' of the sources, but is knowledgeable about them.  I suspect things like, light stop-hit type actions, while holding the sword right on the pommel, and then running away to prevent the afterblow could totally be a useful way to score points. (I've seen some rules that say thrusts require both hands on the blade, presumably exactly for this reason, so I would have people hold the blade right on the pommel with their dominant hand, and then just lightly touch the pommel with their fingers of their other hand, just as a technicality). Especially picking off the hand as a counter attack, if the tournament rules allow.  Also intentionally training doubling-out after blow actions, rather than ""proper"" defenses.  Using the lightest possible blades, maybe adding bends to them so that cuts hook.  I'm not sure if any of these particular things could work, but I'm fairly certain that there is a way to optimize training in order to get points at tournaments that is not at all in line with original sources. It would be neat to see HEMA evolve down this path, into more of a competitive endeavor."
Fencing,3e15pz,venuswasaflytrap,2,Tue Jul 21 11:26:52 2015 UTC,"The issues (to tall them that) you list are already something we're seeing in HEMA, and we try to work around them through designing rules that reward a certain kind of fencing. People will ""game"" the rules, so the challenge is to make ""gaming"" the rules produce the kind of fencing we want to see.  Some tournaments succeed, others fail miserably.  I'll use the rule sets I've worked on and fenced under the most as an example: some target zones (head, thrust to the torso) are worth more than others, and one-handed strikes are rewarded, but with fewer points than those made with both hands. That means that it's possible to win a match by sniping someone's hands, but you can score twice as many point by going for deeper targets.     Using the lightest possible blades, maybe adding bends to them so that cuts hook.     Most big tournaments provide standardized swords to the competitors, at least in longsword, which is the most popular competition weapon."
Fencing,3e15pz,g2petter,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:41:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, so for those rules, I would have students practicing progressive epee actions - hits to the wrist, to the elbow, to the shoulder.  I would also have them practicing touching the base of the blade with their off hand, in an attempts to get 2 handed strike points. I realize there are rules against the competitors arguing during a match, but I would make a big fuss about it socially at a meet. ""Well that guys 2 handed strike wasn't really a strike either - is it because he's from the same region/club/race/nationality - the refs are totally biased"".   I could also have competitors using their body language to indicate to influence the refs - little enough that no one would be able to make an obvious call against them, but enough to put pressure on the refs - exactly like every other sport. Maybe they yell especially loud when it's not theirs, or too late for an after strike. Maybe they act like they weren't hit whenever they are hit - looking just a little bit confused when a halt is called. Whatever.  Also, why not have lots of individual lessons on these things. Drilling mechanical actions at speed and in context over and over. They'll be really good at sniping.  I dunno. It bothers me that HEMA seems to believe itself immune to political pressure, social influence, rule gaming, and all these things which are common to every other sport - or that it's even good to try to ban this stuff outright.   It reminds me of parents trying to prevent their 18 year old kids from going on dates, or the American right trying to police (their own version of) morality, like the war on drugs, or anti gay or whatever. It's seems like their trying to illicit too much control over something to preserve an ideal that never really existed in the first place.  Fencing has it's routes in medieval sword fighting just like HEMA. And not to sound wiggish, but many years of 'rules gaming' is what makes fencing what it is today. After it became largely sportified, there have been many instances of groups of people making a concentrated effort to creatively work within the rules to develop the sport. The East Germans, the Soviets, the Italians.   As one specific example, in foil, I know the Italians have been teaching an action where you step forward and search for the blade. They ensure that their students have really strong blade presence, so if they find the blade, it clearly looks like a beat attack. But if the defender avoids the blade, they teach their students to treat the action as an avoidance, and to finish into the open line. The idea being, one way or the other, the action clears the line for them. I know that the stronger American clubs teach this kind of action too.  And in a way it's completely against the 'spirit' of the rule - how can you be both trying to cause blade contact and trying to avoid blade contact at the same time. But ultimately it creates a whole new dynamic to the game, that is the basis of the fencing of the 2 American world champion podiums.  It's no different than the fosbury flop - finding a way to carry the center of gravity below the high jump bar rather than over it, the forward pass in US football, Boklov's ski jump technique of spreading the skis for more distance. This is what sport is all about.   HEMA's culture of resistance to innovation seems so backwards to me."
Fencing,3e15pz,venuswasaflytrap,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:23:41 2015 UTC,"You're making some very big and, in my mind, wrong generalizations here. Just because the majority of HEMA practitioners aren't (currently) going in the direction you describe, and some are downright conservative, that doesn't mean there isn't a shitload of innovation going on.    Remember, the first large-scale competitions in HEMA were started less than 10 years ago, and the sport is growing and evolving at a tremendous rate. Yes, there are people who frown at the word ""sport"" and want all of HEMA to be a Deadly Duel to the Death (tm), but there is actually a lot of interesting stuff happening.    Both the historical and the martial are integral parts to HEMA, and as a community we're still trying to figure out how to balance that with the stuff that comes packages with being a modern sport."
Fencing,3e15pz,g2petter,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:37:30 2015 UTC,"Specifically, the kind of innovation that I have not seen anyone promote (in my admittedly limited experience), the practice and systematic instruction of an action that is unequivocally a-historical.  e.g. ""Almost all the treatises agree that this movement is a bad idea"" or ""This movement isn't mentioned in any treatise, and wouldn't work with actual longswords"" -  ""but it actually is useful for winning HEMA bouts, so we're going to codify, practice, and refine it into a new techniqe""."
Fencing,3e15pz,venuswasaflytrap,2,Tue Jul 21 13:42:15 2015 UTC,"You already see stuff in tournaments that's successful even though it's either not very well represented in the sources (like one-handed strikes) or even warned against (blindly leaving a bind to strike around).    The question is how to deal with that kind of thing: there's a continuum that stretches from outright banning a technique or an approach, through being indifferent to it, all the way to actively training and encouraging it. Then you have to ask the philosophical question about whether it would technically even be HEMA anymore, and if that's a direction we as a community want to go.    It's not something I have all the answers to, but I think that we currently need to focus on figuring out ""where we are"" and what we want HEMA to be before we start aggressively changing that.  I mean, most people can't even pull off a fraction of the historical techniques in the tradition they train in sparring or competition, so it's probably premature to start looking beyond that just yet.  It's a bit of a non-answer from me because it's a huge topic with lots of arguments on either side, and I honestly don't know what's the best approach."
Fencing,3e15pz,g2petter,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:04:53 2015 UTC,"This is what I mean though. Certainly there will always be a continuum of opinion on pretty much every subject, but I would say the fact that it's best to describe the culture towards this subject as a continuum is fairly revealing.  The other thing that's fairly revealing, is that the issue hasn't been forced yet. Why isn't there a club, or a few clubs, that teach this stuff (one handed strikes, blindly leaving a bind to strike around) as part of the core of their style? Surely you should teach and practice any action action that's shown to be beneficial in competition, regardless of your philosophical opinion of what HEMA should be?  As a competition organizer, you can say, ""Maybe we should ban these"", or ""Maybe we should change the rules"" to promote a different style. But as a coach in a sport, it's not really your role to teach according how you'd like the sport to evolve. I may think that Football was more beautiful without a forward pass, but I would be a bad coach if I had my team trying to play in what I perceived to be a more traditional way - trying to run and lateral the ball up the field. Even if I was only a local high school coach, I should be fired for doing that.  It's up to me to teach the sport. Especially in an individual sport, it's up to my students to decide to how they want to approach the sport - it's not for me to artificially limit them.   I mean, most people can't even pull off a fraction of the historical techniques in the tradition they train in sparring or competition   To me, this isn't evidence that the competitors aren't ready for new actions, but is more evidence that the actions aren't suitable for competition.  This sort of thing evidences itself in fencing too. For example, in foil, you pretty much will never see an envelopment, or a developed attack with 3-4 disengagements. These actions can work on paper, but in reality they're not practical, since they require a lot of things to go right on behalf of your opponent.  Innovation, especially in open skill sports, is all about optimizing your strategy, and often that means shelving techniques that aren't as useful any more. You basically never see an underhand serve in tennis. Yeah it's legal, and possible to make work, but it's largely not a useful technique, so it got shelved. If there is a change in the rules or the way people play, it might prove to be useful again in the future, but right now it's not worth learning, not really.  There might be some people experimenting with a few anachronistic actions in the tournament here and there, but I don't think anyone has actually said ""Fuck the history, fuck the martial art, we're here to score points"", and built an entire school based on a modern sport-centric attitude. I think it would be really interesting if someone would do that. Suddenly these hypothetical questions ""What do we want HEMA to be?"" would come to a very tangible point - ""All of the top performers at the tournament actively use non traditional actions and training styles - how should we address this?""."

Fencing,3e15pz,foiledbyjake,4,Tue Jul 21 04:31:25 2015 UTC,"I've been fencing for 10 years and I feel comfortable in saying that there is nothing like the sport of fencing.  I think there are some strong similarities between fencing and martial arts but the thing that sets it apart from martial arts and other styles of sword-fighting is that modern fencing has a very steep learning curve because almost all of the movements feel very unnatural to newcomers.  I feel like most fencers would regard fencing as a modern sport that is distinct from classical fencing.    As for where to start, if you live in a major city or near one you shouldn't have to much trouble finding a fencing club where you can learn the basics.  Most clubs offer beginner classes and they might have equipment that you can buy.  Prices for membership vary.  Askfred.net may have some info on clubs near you, feel free to look around if you have options because finding a good environment is very important.  absolutefencinggear.com has some great equipment sets for beginners.    Just so you know fencers don't really call it sparring, it is usually referred to as a bout, commonly bouts go until someone has scored 5 points but some clubs may do 15 point bouts which is normal for more serious competitors.  Also a fencing bout is conducted on a long rectangular strip instead of a circle like most other martial arts.  The cool thing about fencing is that it has three different weapons to choose from (Foil, Epee, and Saber).  If you are looking for something fast paced and aggressive I would suggest Saber.  All in all fencing is a great workout that can be a lot of fun if you have the right people around you.  Good luck and welcome to a whole new world!"
Fencing,3e15pz,empress_ardelyn,2,Tue Jul 21 04:55:31 2015 UTC,"I have nothing wise to add to the discussion other than this: spend time in the FIE fencing channel on youtube and watch fencing bouts to see if you like the rules (in the ""right of way"" (kind of like ""turn-based"") weapons such as foil or sabre or the non right of way epee). Watch final and semi final bouts with commentary (David and Karim typically...or at least Karim--the guy with a British accent). These guys make fencing somewhat easier to understand, especially with right of way weapons. Caveat: even after fencing for years, it took me a couple months to even understand every call made by the ref in sabre. So no worries if you're confused!  Of course, you can't judge fencing by video alone. I high suggest that you try fencing for real and learn right of way rules (foil and sabre) in person. To the cynical non-fencing viewer, sabre looks like a mindless game of tag (not true if you actually do it), foil looks like some weird hunched over thing with vests (also not true) and epee looks boring (not true either). Try all three weapons. You might not like some at first but learn to like it once you get past the steep learning curve as others have mentioned. I hated epee at first for being too slow (I do the faster weapon--sabre) but have come to enjoy it. Sabre takes time to get used to it and maybe be frustrating in the beginning--same with foil, etc etc.   If you decide that you like fencing like the rest of us, and have many options on different fencing clubs (especially if you live near a city--especially near NYC), be aware that some clubs are better than others. Some smaller clubs have a nice close-knit family atmosphere but may not be nearly as competitive. Others have a great community but also churn out national and international fencers because they have very very good coaches. The latter may be more costly (but not necessarily--some small clubs may overcharge you) but help you improve. However, since you're strapped for cash, you can learn fencing at any club really just make sure it's not a small/ineffective club that ALSO overcharges. That's the worst. I've been through that before...  This subreddit is also a good place to ask for good fencing clubs near where you live.   One thing: once you take beginner classes, you can pay for monthly/yearly/6 mo membership and get ""free fencing"" where you show up and just have bouts with other people. Some clubs, like the one I go to have somewhat pricey lessons/classes but then offer ""free"" fencing with people afterwards without requiring a daily floor fee or monthly membership."

Fencing,3e15pz,MartinMan2213,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:14:02 2015 UTC,"Most clubs will have two different membership fees.  One that includes equipment and another that doesn't, obviously the membership that doesn't include equipment is going to be cheaper but then you have to source everything yourself.  When I started looking for a club all I did was [insert city] fencing club.  There is only one club where I live so easy choice for me to decide where to go."
Fencing,3e15pz,Wertilq,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:44:32 2015 UTC,"Fencing is somewhere inbetween a martial art and a sport. Like similar space as Tae Kwon Do.  What you learn is a sword-fighting style, and you'll learn the basics of doing that, you'll learn how to handle yourself with a blade and you'll learn to control and develop your body. You'll improve your agility, speed, technique and accuracy, but in the end it's still a sport, and contains several ""sportified elements"". You'll end up with bruises, but very rarely any cuts.  It depends on the club how creative and free you'll develop your style, and what the practice looks like, but overall it's one style, with some variations within the style itself. Most modern fencing clubs will have electrical equipment, and it will only be same weapon against each other, unless you do something silly together.  For a more ""MMA with swords"", I think Historical European Martial Arts/Classical Fencing is closer to what you want. There is a bigger mix of weapons and styles there."

Any individual open skilled sport, boxing, tennis, any martial art, any net sport, log rolling, indoor cycling, etc. requires a lot of strategy. But they generally aren't characterized as physical chess.  Federer, or Mayweather aren't described as a poindexters, using their brain to compensate for their athletic limitations. Even though they're highly strategic players, they're athletes first."

Fencing,3dwc4c,BedBatmanBeyond,4,Mon Jul 20 14:31:06 2015 UTC,"The way I've heard a describe it, epee is a game of chess with a full board, foil is one with half the pieces and sabre is one with three. I don't see this as a commentary of the proportion of physicality vs mentality of each weapon but of range of viable actions, which dictates how much time you spend on the strip planning.  That said, I don't think any weapon is less than 100% physical if you're doing it right. Physical and chess aren't mutually exclusive, they're complementary."
Fencing,3dwc4c,robotreader,3,Mon Jul 20 11:12:05 2015 UTC,"Epee's a lot like chess, if I could take two moves at once in chess, or if my queen missed the capture sometimes."

Fencing,3dwc4c,empress_ardelyn,2,Mon Jul 20 20:39:18 2015 UTC,"My first three years of fencing...lots of just finishing the attack and simply evading the attack. During my fourth year in sabre...the ""chess"" part  really kicked in. Soon, I was watching for tempos, footwork patterns, attack patterns, ""tricking"" my opponent by mixing up my beats (if they threw point of line I would figure out a strategy in preventing them from evading my beat for instance), figuring out my defense (drawing distance, how to force an attack or take a beat and it's not  that simple), 4m strategies and footwork, attacking patterns (and it's just not running forward because better opponents will pick up on that), etc etc.   I improved after my third year of fencing not by actual skill, but by strategy. I have a friend who's younger than me who has better technique but never applies strip tactics or thinks about tricking his opponent...he just uses his physical movement. However, that makes a huge disadvantage.   Personally, although sabre is fast, I find that it just as strategy-based as the other weapons, though maybe not nearly as elaborate (well it is, as you saw my whole paragraph) and also there isn't nearly as much time to strategize. Watching sabre, the touch is over before the viewer can notice ten things that happened at once. A lot of beginner/intermediate fencers don't realize this in sabre--hence it's easier to get into a rut, especially if your pool of opponents in your area is small. During high school fencing, I barely needed  to apply the chess part. During competition fencing, I absolutely had to."

When you take it out of the wash examine it to see if there is still a stain, if so, apply some more of the paste and wait a bit longer.   DO NOT throw it into the dryer if the stain is still there otherwise you will set it and it will not come out.    I've done this with my non-FIE and FIE gear and it has yield excellent results."
Fencing,3dtv5w,dockingnow,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:00:57 2015 UTC,"Since you're using FIE gear, the main thing to avoid is tumble drying it. I made the mistake of tumble drying an outfit on a regular basis a while back, and it did indeed shrink and suffer for it.   Many fencers use ammonia or woolite to clean their gear. But most gear manufacturers do not recommend the use of bleach or oxiclean. If you have a kevlar/dyneema outfit, you could use bleach, but you probably have a polyester or polyamid outfit (see below):   the best thing you can do is wash the stuff regularly with wool/silk detergent and if needed wash it twice. baking soda does help too. [...]. OxiClean/Bleach will have visible and palpable impact on the uniforms and will make it feel course and seem almost brittle. most uniforms are not made out of Kevlar/Dyneema(UHMWPE) but Polyester and Polyamid. both of these are damaged by OC/B."

Fencing,3drl2r,kaeedo,7,Sat Jul 18 19:52:06 2015 UTC,"It's the double pump when the other guy started reaching that really did him in.  if you start back and go forward when you see the counter, it's usually gravy."
Fencing,3dqd12,Bokehlicious,19,Sat Jul 18 12:44:28 2015 UTC,"It's because Epee doesn't have right of way. If you get hit, it's a point for the other person. This forces epeeists to be very cautious and have to set up their attacks perfectly with the right distance, hence the bouncing around. In saber, touches are more based on timing and controlling tempo, and each fencer is ready to jump off the line and hit the other because they know if they attack first, it doesn't matter if they get hit."
Fencing,3dqd12,SickGoose,9,Sat Jul 18 13:16:08 2015 UTC,"It is very common to be able to land a counterattack before the attack lands, in any weapon. In epee that's a point for the counter. In ROW weapons it's not. So ROW encourages you to attack and not worry about the counterattack, and epee rules encourage you to pay attention to the counterattack and do something about it. So in epee you see lots of false attacks, trying to draw a counter so it can be parried, or so you can counter the counter, or whatever.   In addition to that, it's very, very easy to land an attack in saber, all you have to do it touch your opponent with the side of the blade anywhere on his torso. This is much easier than hitting with the tip, it relies much less on point control and distance, and taking ROW relies much more on movement and who started first. So saber is doubly tilted towards an advantage for the attack and away from jockeying for distance, so saber fencers are all insane attackers. Today's saber is actually slowed down some, since the no-crossovers rule. In the 80s saber literally was people running up and down the strip after each other."
Fencing,3dqd12,K_S_ON,3,Sat Jul 18 15:20:43 2015 UTC,"I'd go as far as to say it's possible to perform attacks in sabre that are physically impossible to block, only manageable by distance, right of way or pickoffs."
Fencing,3dqd12,nopenopenopenoway,2,Sat Jul 18 20:20:09 2015 UTC,"I recently had to switch from foil to saber due to a move. I've found saber to be quicker due to the three things I needed to get used to:  1 - lockout time is shorter so you have to hit fast. You can't just trick the defender into a counter-attack and still have time to finish. I got locked out all the time until I sped up my attack.  2 - Since you don't need to hit the point, accuracy is not as important as it is with foil, and Epee. I had a hard time with accuracy in foil, and even a harder time with Epee. With saber, accuracy is pretty much not an issue. Just hit them.  3 - which brings us down to distance. In foil, I had a hard time having a perfect distance. I was always a bit to close and my hits landed flat. Epee was even harder for me. Saber is a breeze, as long as you hit quickly."
Fencing,3dqd12,reddit108,3,Sat Jul 18 13:16:47 2015 UTC,"Really, saber is FASTER BECAUSE THERE IS NO OFF TARGET.  This makes it faster than foil.  It is also a RoW weapon, which means that aggressive forward movement for preparation of the attack is often necessary.   If they are not rushing off the line (which is done a bit more often then foil) for a simul, there WILL be a point given 99% of the time (unless you are Olga Kharlan and fall off the piste every tournament).  There are some very fast and furious foil matches, but maybe 25% or more of the hits are off target.  In epee, if you are ahead and have a dominant defensive strategy, you can rely on counterattacks to close out a bout.  In saber, if you are not aggressive off the line, you are at an extreme disadvantage unless you get someone who can't deal with PiL(not going to happen at international level)."

Fencing,3dpq6x,afeistypeacawk,5,Sat Jul 18 06:33:55 2015 UTC,"I think you're starting your extension too late. If it helps, you can think of the lunge/fleche as using your legs to push your extended arm forward."
Fencing,3dpq6x,KnifeyMcStab,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:35:55 2015 UTC,"Not an epee fencer, but the arm comes out at the same time as the front foot if not a tad later.

Fencing,3dpq6x,empress_ardelyn,3,Sat Jul 18 13:22:08 2015 UTC,"There isn't a reach reason why the arm should come out first or later. As long as the arm is fully extended when you intend to touch, that's fine.  In épée, having the arm out first is important because having the bell guard forward shields you from counter attacks. Just like a goalie coming out of a net to cut down the angle.  This thinking isn't the same in foil and sabre."
Fencing,3dpq6x,venuswasaflytrap,3,Sat Jul 18 13:54:51 2015 UTC,"There isn't a reach reason why the arm should come out first or later. As long as the arm is fully extended when you intend to touch, that's fine.   I think the primary reason to extend earlier or later in foil is the distance between you and the target. At an exceptionally close distance, intending to score on a direct attack, you probably benefit by extending the arm pretty early. By contrast, extending your arm super early while you're still a good advance-lunge from your opponent -- I hope you're not intending to go direct because that's probably never going to work.  I usually look at it this way: An ideal extension is fully extended at the moment of the touch. If you extend early, each moment you're fully extended and haven't made the touch there is an opportunity for your opponent to take the blade. If you extend late, each moment you are in distance to finish the distance and haven't yet there is an opportunity for your opponent to set up a counter-attack.   I think that makes sense?"
Fencing,3dpq6x,toolofthedevil,6,Sat Jul 18 18:59:59 2015 UTC,"Hey, thanks for putting this up. A few thoughts:   In general, get lower in your en garde position. You're a tall dude, so the lower you make your center of gravity, the more ""spring action"" you get when you explode into the flèche. You get a little high in your flèche. The flèche moves forward, with your shoulders being almost level with the en garde stance. It seems you go just a little too high when you explode into the flèche, so try focusing on moving the flèche forward. Extension first, always. Or it's easier to counterattack."

The thing that I was overlooking for years, was to get my hips forward and inline with the vector of force your legs are providing.  Having your torso forward like that feels faster (at least to me), but when you look from the side, you can see that your bum sticks out, and you're not getting the full power from your legs, cus your body is bent at the hips."
Fencing,3dpq6x,white_light-king,3,Sat Jul 18 12:45:20 2015 UTC,"This may be a foil critque, so take with a grain of salt, but I think your back leg should be bent more so you can use that big quad muscle to shove your hips and center of gravity forwards in lunges.  In Fleche's the back leg provides the initial shove to get a quick start before the front leg does the main push forwards."

Fencing,3dpq6x,Ajnsztajnsays,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:24:59 2015 UTC,"yep.  ""get the lean"", means violently tip yourself forward until you have to give a hard push with your front foot to not faceplant.    You're actually already getting a pretty quick tilt with just your back foot/ankle/calf, just add a little more quad into the motion you're already doing and I think you could get a hair faster if you can keep your fluidity.  (Edit: Don't change too much though, you're basic technique is good and you look pretty ""quick"" and ""loose"" with little telegraphing, which is really important for Epee, and you shouldn't lose those qualities to get more acceleration on advice of a foilist.)"

Fencing,3dpq6x,shrimplifi,3,Sun Jul 19 23:55:59 2015 UTC,I noticed quite a few things. Lets start with the fleche. When you start you start to transition from a step to a fleche you bring your body weight upward. This is do to a few things. The major issue is that you keep you bring your feet to close together before the fleche. Causing you to have to stand up more. Second is that right before you push off your back foot you slide your back foot about 3 inches and come onto the ball of your foot. This further shortens your engarde and causes you to bring your center of balance futher up. It also adds extra time and movement to the fleche. The fleche needs to be explosive so any you want to make it as quick and dynamic as possible.  Now onto the lunge. It looks like you are not pushing from you back leg. Instead all the power if coming from kicking your front leg out. This is why your back leg is still slightly bent when you land. you shouyld work on using your back leg as the main power for the lunge and extendign it all the way. A drill i like for this is to balance just on your back leg when you lunge and then to push off as hard as you can. This makes you just focuos on your back leg which if you start to use can really make a lunge great.
Fencing,3dpq6x,St_Meow,2,Sun Jul 19 21:41:38 2015 UTC,"I second your lunge drill. I was working on that with a friend that falls into her lunge.   From en guard, balance momentarily (or longer if you can), and push hard with your back leg driving your motion with your quad and butt. Your front leg should not be pulling you forward because at that point it is more of a controlled fall instead of an explosion forward."

Fencing,3dpq6x,StolenBalloon,2,Sat Jul 18 18:54:40 2015 UTC,"Regarding your fleche, be sure to know the difference between keeping your arm up and fleching upwards. Currently you seem to try and push yourself up in the fleche, in doing this you lose some of the speed which is absolutely essential if you want to do a good fleche. If you can practise fleching forwards like the arrow the move is named after while still holding your hand above your shoulder your fleches will induce nightmares in your opponents since it will be impossible to hit your shoulder, which is usually an epeeists first reaction to an oncoming left-handed fleche."

Dunk mask and squeeze out the bib to get the soaps out. Once soap is out, squeeze out as much water as you can, towel dry everything, dry out the mask. You're good to go."

Get someone in there who understands epee, for god's sake. Ukraine is increasing its lead from 3-2 to 5-2 while these two are discussing what a crappy spectacle this is for spectators, and gradually coming to the dawning realization that it's just increasing tension for the final leg, and somehow this ought to be communicated.   Somehow. Hmmmm. If only there were a couple of people whose job it was to talk about the sport and, you know, through the use of their voices and the language they pick and so on, somehow communicate that to the people watching. Wow, that would be cool, eh?  Seriously, a long buildup is fine. Half the damn world watches soccer matches going 0-0 for 90 minutes and thinks it's fascinating, it's not like tactical games that don't score points fast are universally hated. Build it up, do your job! Talk about who's coming up, who on the Korean team is likely to try to make the points up? Who's fencing the last leg? Who's fencing the 8th leg? When is Korea likely to try to make a move? What would it be like, I wonder, if the people doing commentary actually knew something about the sport? Don't they fly over there? Don't they have fucking hours on a plane to look at data on the fencers? Isn't there someone in the whole damn mess who can sit behind them and tell them who on the Korean team is the best attacking fencer, so they can talk about it like it's a sport?  Or, you know, just get someone in the booth who understands epee. That might be nice, instead of us listening to a ROW commentary person who clearly despises what he's watching and feels the need to delve deeply into everything wrong with the sport he's being paid to comment on during the god dammed world championships, while ignoring the points being scored right in front of them.  Honestly, they did this last time too. We get it, you hate epee. Hey, here's an idea, take a break. I bet there are one or two people there who could talk into a mic for half an hour who don't hate epee, what do you think?  I bet there are.  edit: my awkward phrasing was driving me crazy, sorry."

For my part:   I'd do this again, but probably only for Worlds and the Olympics (because as I noted in a megathread, I tend to only follow my weapon for the other world stuff). I am on the fence about the ""notables"" category; I meant it as a way for people who don't follow the world scene at all to get into the storylines, but now that I look back at them, it's basically me just talking about Americans.

Fencing,3dnv9o,Babilos,5,Fri Jul 17 20:11:12 2015 UTC,"The problem is that fencing is not a closed skill sport.  You can do a ""perfect"" lunge and still miss your target.  Maybe you hit your target but it's not your touch.  It's not like javelin where you throw a million times a week and hit the gym the rest of the time and see improvements a week later.  There are a lot of variables to test and instincts to develop that are just hard to evaluate.  Your best bet might be to set up something close to the NFL combine and add some distance related exercises."
Fencing,3dnv9o,justin107d,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:25:07 2015 UTC,Agreed. The most an evaluation could predict is who might have an overall better or worse chance of being a successful fencer. It wouldn't be an exact science.

Things like hand-eye coordination, distance perception, and balance are very easy to measure, but difficult to develop. Especially distance. A fencer with perfect distance can be absolutely awful at most other aspects of fencing, and still do very well."
Fencing,3dnv9o,venuswasaflytrap,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:32:44 2015 UTC,"Great point on distance. I wonder how you'd evaluate that. My first instinct would be a timed parallel parking test, but that's a little too far outside the realm of fencing. How else can you evaluate a person's ability to judge distance?"
Fencing,3dnv9o,venuswasaflytrap,2,Fri Jul 17 21:39:58 2015 UTC,"You gotta really be careful about trying to measure one ability in terms of another ability.

Fencing,3dnv9o,ConvertsToMetric,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:45:55 2015 UTC,"True, but it is also a general skill that some people have and other people don't. Maybe the candidate would get 1 minute to get a feel for the length of the blade by hitting a wall target. Then they have to start at least 10 feet away and quickly move in to their chosen distance, stop, and hit the target with a simple full extension. The goal would be to just barely hit the target without falling short and without introducing bend in the blade. Points would be deducted for taking too long and for any deviation from the ideal distance. Now who's going to steal my idea and be the one who finally introduces science to fencing? I'm not going to do it myself so it's up for grabs."

Fencing,3dnv9o,eelvex,3,Sat Jul 18 13:48:40 2015 UTC,"Fencing is not like pro baseball (or pro anything), where we're comparing the skills of professional athletes who make a career out of the sport.  So the number one thing I would look for, is some sort of financial support and other support structure to train as much as they want to. And then I would look for indications that the kid wants to, and will want to compete - I don't know what that might be, but if they have obvious other major interests, or something else, that might be something to consider.  But if fencing was a full time profession that you didn't have to worry about those things for.  Reaction time would not be what I look for.  http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167945702001033  Basal RT is not a good predictor for athletic success. The ability to react to things and choose the right reaction is a learned sport specific skill.

And one of the other things I've never seen is someone who has a deer in the headlights reaction who later went on to have quick reflexes. At most they have gone from completely freezing up to responding very slowly after a year of practicing."

Fencing,3dnv9o,CaptainExcel,3,Fri Jul 17 22:45:03 2015 UTC,Time and again has been shown that innate RT is not a good predictor of sports performance (even in sports like baseball or boxing).

I've seen both of those too many times to ignore these seemingly natural variations. You can't teach tall, and in my opinion you can't teach graceful or coordinated either."
Fencing,3dllyw,BeardedFencer,3,Fri Jul 17 16:54:02 2015 UTC,"I don't think I've ever seen someone execute a fencing action 'almost flawlessly' after a week fencing.  I've seen people who have had athletic backgrounds have less trouble with some of the physical aspects, but not anyone who was magically gifted.  I've also never seen anyone who was any good at fencing who hasn't put in a fuck ton of time practicing.  I've seen supposed 'hopeless uncoordinated' people go from awkward to graceful through lots of effort.  As for people who do put in lots of effort, but don't get any better - I would look at how they're training."
Fencing,3dllyw,SephoraRothschild,3,Fri Jul 17 16:59:12 2015 UTC,I was once so uncoordinated and my coaches had a hard time working with me - now I am fairly athletic and extremely dextrous!  It took me years and years.  Right now my two best students are polar opposite - one has a background in martial arts and can pick up anything I teach him. The other is stubborn and awkward and it takes repetition and sooooo many scenarios and it's feels like pulling teeth sometimes.  But.. He learns it and he can incorporate it and he is getting better.  I also find that my students that struggle the most feel the most accomplished down the road and tend to stick with the sport longer.  The prodigies get bored or something.
Fencing,3dllyw,angrypidgeon,2,Sat Jul 18 07:23:40 2015 UTC,"This. Physical training for fencing or any HIIT/OLY/athlete-centric activity isn't just something that happens in six months. You're looking at 3-5 years minimum--if you're consistent in your athletic conditioning, don't slack off, and don't let life distract you from stopping your conditioning regimen--before you're going to see serious gains. Even kids have to get to this point--I know a 14yo female foilist who just finished up Nationals earning her A. She started when she was 10 and takes 4 lessons per week. Over four years of fencing-specific training. Not all of us older kids have that kind of time, especially with full-time jobs and families. But you fit it in if it's important to you, and you don't beat yourself up if you aren't winning tournaments after your first year of fencing. It's going to take time and consistency and mental toughness to be successful in this game. Don't beat yourself up, listen to your coach, and be consistent in your training, and you will see results with time."

Fencing,3dllyw,venuswasaflytrap,2,Wed Jul 22 05:01:47 2015 UTC,"It's like we live in two different worlds...I'd love to be able to understand these differences    I don't think I've ever seen someone execute a fencing action 'almost flawlessly' after a week fencing.   I have, many times. Let's be generous and change the time frame to 2 months. And let's clarify that I'm referring to simple actions such as advance, retreat, and lunge in a lesson environment with no pressure of a bout or drill. I've seen fencers who can do a graceful lunge with full extension of the arm and back leg after only one lesson with minimal verbal correction. I've also seen fencers whose front foot literally wobbles and flails during the lunge, who nearly fall forward after each lunge, and who are apparently incapable of using verbal or visual feedback to correct those problems. Show me a fencer's actions in isolation after 2 months and I'll show you the way that fencer will fence for the rest of their lives.   I've also never seen anyone who was any good at fencing who hasn't put in a fuck ton of time practicing.   I have. All the time. The best fencers at my club rarely if ever take lessons and their total practice routine consists of doing a few bouts a few times a month. The ones who work the hardest might make small personal improvements, but their skill will always be dwarfed by the natural fencers who barely even have to try. At an elite level the training regimen might be intense, but even then I've heard about the routines used by elite fencers and it really isn't that much time overall.   I've seen supposed 'hopeless uncoordinated' people go from awkward to graceful through lots of effort.   I've seen people with low self-opinion label themselves as awkward, but that description was not backed up by actual observation. Those people eventually believed they had overcome their awkwardness, but in reality they were never awkward in the first place. I've never seen someone who was objectively awkward (and was older than say 14) overcome awkwardness. They might be able to achieve decent results in spite of being awkward, but they will never stop lunging like an intoxicated ferret.   As for people who do put in lots of effort, but don't get any better - I would look at how they're training.   I used to adhere to the same philosophy. It was fencing  (and not just my own experience) that cured me of this delusion. If someone is putting in lots of effort and not getting better, I would look at their natural strengths and weaknesses before I would blame their training program. After all, the best training program I've seen anyone do is ""no lessons, no drills, a few bouts, several months off, victory!"" Surely you wouldn't recommend that for a struggling fencer."
Fencing,3dllyw,Babilos,3,Fri Jul 17 17:44:04 2015 UTC,"The best fencers in your club only fence a few bouts per month? So, they never fenced before, took a few beginner lessons, and then only showed up once a month or so and became the best fencers in your club after having only fenced a couple dozen times a year?  That's fucking crazy. How many years have they been fencing for? Even after 3 years, if they fence 5 bouts a night, they'll have only fenced a few hundred bouts.  I think it's quite easy to show up, practice and not learn anything, especially in fencing. It doesn't matter if you really worked hard that night if you didn't work on something useful.   If I thought that stacking bricks was useful to my fencing, I could stack bricks all night till exhaustion, but not get any better at setting up a riposte. It's no different than if someone tells you to practice a fencing action in a way that's not optimal, or not very useful.   Practicing 100 lunges in a form that doesn't facilitate scoring isn't going to help you much more than not lunging at all.  How good are your clubs 'best fencers'. It seems to be a poor statistic if your best fencers are more successful than the ones that get special effort from the coach."
Fencing,3dllyw,UselessFencingFacts,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:11:25 2015 UTC,"That's fucking crazy. How many years have they been fencing for? Even after 3 years, if they fence 5 bouts a night, they'll have only fenced a few hundred bouts.   3 to 5 years, but they were surprisingly successful even in their first tournaments. Of course they had tremendous natural athletic ability which they had possessed since childhood. Their basic fencing actions during their first lessons were better than those of some fencers who'd been at it for over 10 years.   Practicing 100 lunges in a form that doesn't facilitate scoring isn't going to help you much more than not lunging at all.   Or perhaps if you're naturally coordinated and athletic, your practice will naturally be in a form that facilitates scoring. If you're naturally awkward, your practice will naturally be in a form that doesn't produce any improvement simply because it's impossible for you to do anything with proper form.   How good are your clubs 'best fencers'.   Consistently top 25%, often earning medals in local tournaments. Consistently top 40% in national events. Those are the ones who take few or no lessons and whose only training is occasional bouting. The ones who take a lot of lessons and who do a lot of practice/training rarely break into the top half even at local events. Of course the former are athletic and the latter tend to be awkward."
Fencing,3dllyw,Babilos,2,Fri Jul 17 18:34:33 2015 UTC,"So they consistently win two DE bouts? That is nothing impressive. Seriously. Considering what qualifies as an event in some places, it may or may not be amazing.  Top 40% in national events? That should easily be searchable. Which country?"
Fencing,3dllyw,venuswasaflytrap,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:08:13 2015 UTC,"It's not amazing, but it's a lot better than the hopeless fencers who've never won a legitimate DE (i.e., one other than last vs next-to-last for the right to fence the #1 seed). My statistics are estimated, so let's talk about the qualitative trend rather than trying to find a minor flaw in the math."
Fencing,3dllyw,Babilos,2,Fri Jul 17 19:21:20 2015 UTC,"Well, top 40% at national events still leaves lots of room for improvement, but it's still pretty good.   Surely these 'naturally athletic' people don't just fence though. I mean, if they just ate Doritos and lazed about and then fenced a few bouts once a week, they wouldn't be very strong, or have very good cardio at the least.  The students that are taking lessons - why don't they go to the gym and become stronger/faster than the 'naturally athletic' students?  And what kind of drills are they doing that they aren't faster on their feet?  From what I hear you're telling me, the 'natural' fencers, are probably getting more from their once a week bouts than the multi times a week fencers are getting from their drills. I think that's more a reflection of the drills than the fencing bouts though."

Fencing,3dllyw,Babilos,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:24:42 2015 UTC,"If success in fencing were determined by inherent factors like ""fast reflexes"" or ""naturally athletic"", we'd see top fencers come out of all kinds of clubs, more or less randomly distributed across the US, since such factors are no doubt randomly distributed across the country. But we don't. We see top fencers come out of the same clubs, over and over, and we see clubs that never produce top fencers.  It's training. It's almost all training. If there's anything inherent to the fencer that's vital to success, it's stuff like ""I'm tall"" and ""I enjoy being in a DE when it's 14-14, I think that's fun"" and ""I'm a gym rat who likes to train""."

Fencing,3dllyw,WildZontar,2,Sun Jul 19 21:32:39 2015 UTC,"Interesting. What would you say are the differences in training philosophies between successful clubs and unsuccessful clubs?    If you restrict the discussion to clubs that are trying to produce national level kids, and not just run a recreational club two or three nights a week, the difference seems to be the coach. There are clubs all over the country trying to turn out national level kids who never do, and a few clubs that start with beginners and regularly have kids winning NACs and competing internationally.   Is there a possibility that successful clubs only accept athletes with good fencing potential while unsuccessful clubs accept anyone and everyone?   I'm an hour down the road from a top epee club. They don't screen for athletic ability, they're running a business, if you come in and sign up and pay for the class you get the class. If you pay for lessons you get lessons, they're not going to test your reflexes or something. I see overweight unathletic kids in beginner classes there all the time. And yet, year after year, they turn out winner after winner, and not ""won a local Div II event in a high school gym with seventeen people signed up"", I mean winning NACs, kids going on to fence NCAAs at a high level, doing well in Cadet and Junior international competitions.  A few people have become very good epee fencers without good coaching. I think Tim Glass won the junior worlds with little or no coaching, many years ago. But the distribution of winners is not nearly random enough for 'athletic talent' or 'reflexes' or whatever to explain the bulk of success in fencing. Overwhelmingly, success in fencing is associated with having a good coach and fencing at a club that's produced successful fencers in the past."
Fencing,3dllyw,Babilos,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:53:25 2015 UTC,"I would venture to guess that the ones who pick it up faster have more experience being physically active in general, and so are more used to learning how to use their body in new ways."
Fencing,3dllyw,WildZontar,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:09:18 2015 UTC,"I agree. This raises the question of whether they are successful merely because they are more active, or if they are more active because they experienced early successes with physical activity that their awkward counterparts didn't."
Fencing,3dllyw,Wertilq,2,Fri Jul 17 20:16:30 2015 UTC,"Probably both. There is absolutely variation in terms of how naturally apt people are at physical activity, but not to the degree that anyone without a disability is ""hopeless"". A lot of habits in terms of how one moves their body are learned at a young age and the older someone gets the more work it takes to un-learn those habits if they're bad.  What I'm trying to say is I would expect someone who is less ""naturally"" talented but started doing sports at a young age would still progress at a MUCH faster rate than someone who is more ""naturally"" talented but never did anything physical until their early teens when they started fencing. Really the only place I would expect the difference (on average) to be important is when two people have similar backgrounds in sports, at which point ""natural"" talent would come into play.  edit: regarding motivation, I'm tempted to say that parenting makes a bigger difference than anything else..."

Fencing,3dllyw,Wertilq,6,Fri Jul 17 10:41:15 2015 UTC,I'm a fan of the advance lunge game for pairs.  Put them en guard facing each other at roughly advance lunge distance. One person can take ONLY two forward movements (Basically x2 advance or advance lunge) they can be any size or tempo.  The other person can either A: stand there and get hit (probably not a great option...) OR B) can retreat as far as they like.  As soon as the first person has completed their x2 forward movements then the initial defender can make x2 forward movements of their own and the initial attacker must now defend with distance. And so on back and forth.  The aim is for whoever happens to be attacking to manage to hit their partner. The aim for the person who is trying to defend with distance is to retreat far enough (if necessary) that they don't get hit BUT can hopefully not be so far away that they cannot make a successful attack of their own.  Teaches great understanding of control of distance and timing. You can start it slow and get as fast as you like.

Or alternately you can only score doing Y where Y is some set of things you're trying to work on. It's up to your opponent as to whether they want to impose rules on themselves.

The mental game is always the more important one, but if you don't have the fundamentals down it will be very very difficult to un-learn bad muscle memory later on and re-learn how to do the right thing."

(Batté vs Pressé)  I am a big fan of doing beats, as setup, provocation, mindgames and whatnot, I've never really learnt how to do a proper press though, and when I read up on follow-up on a press, I see mentions of both direct and indirect attacks.  What are the key points of doing a press? What are the strengths and weaknesses of the move? What follow-up is good?"
Fencing,3dllyw,Wertilq,2,Sat Jul 18 06:14:51 2015 UTC,"(This comes from sabre, so it might not quite apply to your case)  The gist I get with the press is that it gives you more control, but is harder to set up. While a beat can be done on both the back and the front foot, depending on the distance, a press can only be done on the front foot, from a longer distance. This way you can get close quickly, taking a large step, without worrying about the stop hit that would normally punish such a large step. The rhythm for a good press with advance-lunge should go something like this: baaaa dum dum, where the baaa is the front leg starting the advance, the first dum is your back foot hitting the ground, and the last is your front foot hitting the ground from the lunge. The press should start with the baaaa and end after the first dum. This way you have the time to close distance, and only break engagement when the opponent can't do anything about it."

But your press isn't going to happen when you have RoW. [Mentally, ]You're going to be doing it when you have priority. You're not going to be doing it when you are defending/retreating/don't have RoW. It's an action you're doing as a threatening action, which is more or less going to be perceived as an attack. Which, if you're a foilist (and a sabrist) you should only be doing if you have RoW."
Fencing,3dllyw,nineExMachina,2,Sun Jul 19 03:54:39 2015 UTC,"A press is a bit more subtle. Basically when you do a bind as a prep, there's two main options. Either the opponent presses back or they disengage/drop their weapon. If your opponent presses back, the moment your blade moves away, their blade will move in the direction they're pressing. I usually do a bind, then coupe flick. However you could just do disengage beat from there as well. If your opponent disengages you can do a double feint disengage with advance lunge or a double coupe flick to the hand. You want that double disengage because generally your opponent will expect one disengage. However people rarely expect two"

Fencing,3dmxei,TheFencingCoach,23,Fri Jul 17 15:58:41 2015 UTC,"saw the cowardice of Iranian fencer Taher Ashouri,   That's fucking bullshit and completely unfair. Here is a guy from a country with a fucking religious police that often literally follow them to international tournaments.  Tell you what. Book a flight to Iran, walk right into the Basij headquarters, and say ""I'm so and so, and I think your athletes are cowards for not fencing Israelis"". I mean, if I were you I would be legitimately worried that I would probably never see my family or friends again - but I guess that makes me a coward.  Don't bring the athletes into this. They just want to fence."
Fencing,3dmxei,venuswasaflytrap,-5,Fri Jul 17 16:12:21 2015 UTC,"It's completely fair. Usually they fake being sick and are no-shows the next morning. Ashouri appeared and outright refused to fence after seeing he was scheduled to fence a DE against an Israeli (Drizen). Application of rule t.85.1.   If sports federations like the FIE begin to ban nations like Iran who outwardly state their refusals to compete, then maybe they'll change the policy. Until then, it's a disgrace that we even allow them to fence."
Fencing,3dmxei,venuswasaflytrap,21,Fri Jul 17 16:21:56 2015 UTC,"Ashouri is not Iran.   Yes he represents Iran, because frankly his choices are represent Iran or don't fence. It's literally illegal for him to fence Israelis. There are some serious fucking repercussions for him if he breaks that law.   You got to be completely out of touch with the realities of living under the law of religious police to call him a coward.   For example, last year some people were arrested for dancing. The punishment included 91 lashes.  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-29272732  It's easy to criticize someone's lack of protest against their nations laws from behind a computer screen when you don't risk getting arrested and beaten yourself.  Iranian fencers just want to fence. That stupid law means they pretty much can't make any results no matter how good they are. It sucks for them, and as far as I've seen, they largely don't agree with the law. But not wanting to get arrested and beaten is pretty strong motivation to follow the law.  As for excluding Iran from the FIE - isn't the whole crux of your argument that people should compete against each other regardless of their differences? Yeah Iran is boycotting direct competition against Israeli athletes, but they're sending athletes to the same tournament. They're friends with the same fencers. Surely that's a step in the right direction - banning Iran would be a exactly the same as the boycott you take objection to."
Fencing,3dmxei,venuswasaflytrap,-3,Fri Jul 17 16:34:54 2015 UTC,"Suppose you were in a pool at a world cup and you have an Israeli and Iranian in your pool. You beat the Iranian, so do a few others in your pool, and next bout, he has to fence the Israeli.   You know what happens next. He's black carded, and all those bouts are invalidated. It's fair to no competitor, and yet you see these refusals coming from a mile away.   Despite its status as an Asian country, Israel is already forced to compete in the Eurozone because it's widely known that this kind of politicism is going to be present in any sport-- not just fencing.   Yes, the crux of my argument is precisely what you said. What's the point of allowing them to continue coming if you know the outcome is always going to be the same?"
Fencing,3dmxei,venuswasaflytrap,9,Fri Jul 17 16:43:28 2015 UTC,"Yes, this has happened to me a couple times. It sucks, because, frankly, I need the wins.  But it sucks way more for the Iranian guy. It's not his fault. And you know what sucks more for him? Living under the rule of religious police.  I would love it Iran lifted the ban. Iranian fencers would love it even more if they lifted the ban. But they haven't, and it sucks.  What's the point of me fencing Iranian fencers? It's the same point of me fencing any other countries fencer. It brings people together. I haven't really hung out with the Iranian fencers, but as far as I can tell, they seem like nice guys. That's the point isn't it? Getting to know each other."
Fencing,3dmxei,FractalBear,-2,Fri Jul 17 16:52:07 2015 UTC,"That's the point isn't it? Getting to know each other.   We're on the same page here, for the most part. Pierre de Coubertin originally didn't want flags/anthems to be a part of the Olympics, because the idea was behind competing under the banner of Olympism and sport, which trumped all politics/allegiance to countries.   Iran's strict rules about refusing to compete are undermining the spirit of competition. If federations begin turning their back to Iran, then surely Iran will change this policy and allow their athletes to compete against any nation/religion/gender/etc."
Fencing,3dmxei,venuswasaflytrap,3,Fri Jul 17 16:59:17 2015 UTC,Maybe they would change. Maybe they wouldn't. But really you're only punishing the athletes.  I think fines would make more sense.  What the hell is the point of fighting a boycott with another boycott?
Fencing,3dmxei,venuswasaflytrap,-3,Fri Jul 17 17:05:57 2015 UTC,"Because every single country that is appearing at worlds this year is willing to fence Israel. Except Iran.   Every country appearing at worlds is willing to put politics aside for a brief moment for the sake of competition. Except Iran.   And it's not like this indolent behavior (from the sports federation) should come as a surprise anymore. It's the Iranian sports federation that is tarnishing not only fencing, but global sport. Kick them out until they can play nice with others."
Fencing,3dmxei,venuswasaflytrap,10,Fri Jul 17 17:10:58 2015 UTC,"That doesn't make the fencer a coward. If their livelihood is at stake then I don't blame them one bit for what they do. The issue is that their national body demands this of them.  I certainly don't think Iran is doing the right thing, but I generally don't fault an individual for doing simple self-preservation. And I agree that the FIE should follow their own rules and throw around some suspensions/bans."

No-shows I feel for. They want to fence, but like you said, the repercussions for fencing are extreme. Don't you think there's something to be said about the fact Ashouri appeared at the venue and declined?"
Fencing,3dmxei,Nmathmaster123,9,Fri Jul 17 17:06:23 2015 UTC,"Yes. I think it shows that maybe he wanted to watch the fencing. Or maybe it shows that the religious police that sometimes accompany the Iranian team wanted him to do that (I heard a story where they managed to ditch their chaperons and go partying. Second hand info, but apparently they were dancing with very, er, large, ladies and still having a blast - you know how rumors go though).  Or even maybe the guy was raised in antisemitic and anti-israeli culture, and has internalized some of those views, and was making a statement. I don't know, and I don't really care. 'Us vs them' othering and childish name-calling is the exact shit that we're arguing against. In the unlikely event that the guy wants to boycott israeli sports, then that's his problem and his loss, and we don't need to embrace his hate, and join him in it.  Probably it's some mix of a lot of reasons (I would guess the main reason would be that he wanted to watch the fencing though - cus like I said, my experience has been that Iranian fencers hate the boycott more than anyone).   Regardless lets not point fingers. It's bad that Iran has a boycott. That doesn't make individual a bad person."
Fencing,3dmxei,K_S_ON,2,Fri Jul 17 17:17:07 2015 UTC,"Yes. My comment is roughly echoing your post.  I think we're in total agreement except for when you talk about Ashouri, my apologies for not making that clear."

But we cannot demand such heroism, and call anyone who fails to display it cowardly. There is a long, long middle ground between outright heroism and cowardice. How many of us would put ourselves and our families at risk to make such a gesture?  Condemning the Iranian policy is certainly justified, but in my view criticizing the individual athletes is not. We have no idea what kind of hold the Iranian government has over them, or what they would be risking if they were to disobey orders and fence."

Fencing,3dk27y,sinking_sunk,3,Thu Jul 16 23:05:03 2015 UTC,The entire match is a clear example of why bending forward is bad as it just gives up target area that you cannot defend when a skilled opponent can land on it.
Fencing,3dk27y,sinking_sunk,6,Fri Jul 17 02:49:11 2015 UTC,"No, come on, that's ridiculous. Massialas made it through Kruse, Haiwei Chen, Halstead, Akhmatkhuzin. Every one of those guys has a major podium under their belt. And he went through them in his usual style, with a bit of a forward lean.  I mean, the action is a compound riposte. A feint disengagement with a flick. Massialas is closing the line, and stepping forward to make the disengagement to the sixte harder. The fact that Ota can turn it into a flick to the back, so quickly, from so close, before Massialas can pull his shoulder back is pretty damn impressive.  I think, the only lesson here is, when you're fencing one of Men's foil's most athletic fencers of the past decade, on the day of his life, he's probably gonna fuck you up no matter what you do."
Fencing,3dk27y,sinking_sunk,2,Fri Jul 17 09:01:49 2015 UTC,"Haha, it's not a slight against Massialas -- he's an amazing fencer and he has an Olympic-level style.  And it's not to take anything away from Ota -- Ota's speed, ability, and variety continues to increase, which is remarkable.  Ota ate him for lunch in most every line.    I'm less critiquing the match and more highlighting how bending forward can give up target area.  I think it a viable lesson you can clearly see from this match.  Counting the number of back hits Ota has on Massialas in this match, Ota clearly knew the line was there to take."
Fencing,3dk27y,HhhHhm,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:55:22 2015 UTC,"Any line is there to take if you execute your action with amazing skill and athleticism.

Fencing,3djhxl,white_light-king,2,Thu Jul 16 20:38:03 2015 UTC,"From my... Sevenish years of experience, I've learned that when it comes to blades, you get what you pay for. The top quality FIE or Leon Paul blades are expensive, but they're worth it. They're typically built to stay alive for a while. My weapon of choice is epee, so blades can last years or days, really, but the Leon Paul I use is actually (according to a blade tech at a tournament) 26 years old. Picked it out of a dead blade bin and rewired it. Love the thing. The modern ones (the one that sells for like 87 dollars on their site) is widely used at my club, and I've yet to see anyone ever break one. Or even hear of one breaking.   If you're doing foil, though, expect broken blades out the ass. My club is littered with foils with the last 9 inches snapped off. You can buy top quality foil blades, too, and they'll last a while, but they'll still probably live a relatively short life.  With saber, it doesn't really matter. Those things stay good forever, and they're cheap and easy to replace.  Also, your number of broken blades has no correlation to your ability or effort. Really, most of your touches should just be little tiny pokes. If you're getting huge bends, you're getting waaaaaay too close to your opponent."
Fencing,3djhxl,Poodler,2,Thu Jul 16 23:19:46 2015 UTC,"Damn, maybe I just hit too hard or maybe your blades are magical adamantium-vibranium blades, but I can't imagine having a 26 year old épée. I usually break blades every 7-8 months and that's with 5-6 times a week with maybe 2-3 tournaments a month. I use bf whites, a bit stiff, very light. Granted, I have a couple blades I really hate (too heavy and soft) and those I don't break"
Fencing,3djhxl,hardwaregeek,2,Fri Jul 17 01:25:44 2015 UTC,"I have a twenty-odd year old epee. Narrow gauge forte, very flexible. I use it for lessons, but don't fence with it any more. I bought it in college, probably 1989 or so, and it just never broke."
Fencing,3djhxl,K_S_ON,2,Sat Jul 18 03:08:37 2015 UTC,"I agree that quality is worth paying for, but IMO the non-FIE LP epee is as good and as durable as the FIE, and much cheaper.   Also, your number of broken blades has no correlation to your ability or effort. Really, most of your touches should just be little tiny pokes. If you're getting huge bends, you're getting waaaaaay too close to your opponent.    These two ideas seem to be in contradiction, but anyway: some people like to infight. Some of those people are very, very good fencers. They're going to get in close, hit hard, get big bends. If that's their style of fencing they're not getting too close, they're getting to exactly the right distance."

More along the lines of ""If your racing bike still has tread on the sides of the tires, you're not going fast enough to lean far enough"" (sort of poor analogy, lol)""   Anyhow, thanks.

No. Maybe you just fence at long distance and get lots of light hand touches. Not everyone wants to crash the distance and take big bends in the epee.

Doesn't help that people at club practice tend to have worse distance than I do and don't know how to retreat, so my distance is usually way too close."
Fencing,3djhxl,Emfuser,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:46:03 2015 UTC,"Early this year I bought an FS, fenced with it for about three weeks and then left for Uganda (where I didn't fenced). Came back and fenced with it for a month. Twice a week, plus tournaments every forthnight. Last Tuesday it broke. So, in fencing time, I broke it in two months :(  I loved that blade; light, flicky, but still very nice for parrying. Very few dents in the forte and still shiny... The thread of tip broke after I fleched and a remised on prime...   Before that one I had a BF that lasted a year until it got stolen in a tournament (whoever you are, I hate you). Weapon was completely dented and curved in funny ways, but no sign of it failing or giving up on life just yet.  Having taken that pain out of my chest, and to your question... Yeah, breaking weapons is just what we do :( There are just many variables to consider... A friend of mine breaks epee like crazy, mostly because when he's loosing he gets mad and starts to fence very aggresively, which ends up in a lot of fleches and strong lunges at relatively close distance. But even if you fence perfectly fine, sometimes the forge makes imperfect batches with weak spots that will just break.   I have the feeling that breaking weapons just ""happens"" when you fence like a normal human being."
Fencing,3djhxl,dax268,2,Fri Jul 17 11:39:00 2015 UTC,I love the FS blades and they've had this problem for awhile. I've had three break on me right at the tip and with less than six months on them. Right now I've got two wired up that have lasted awhile and three more unwired. I make a point to not use them for any hard target work.

Épées are a little stiffer than foils, but the weigh more and have heavier tips too, so its easier to get the bend by just cranking on it.  I think the reason that it seems so impressive in épée, is that most of the times that a person would wind up for the flick like that, they would be hit with remise on the arm. So most people don't practice it.   Whenever I've fenced épée I find its not too hard to turn on a light with a flick riposte to the back of the shoulder, its quite a natural foil action. The problem is, a lot of the time, unless I've really got control of the blade I get killed with the remise.  I think the impressive thing about heinzers action here is the balls to set up."

Fencing,3dfjiw,empress_ardelyn,3,Thu Jul 16 02:07:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah don't blame the fencers. It really sucks for them. If they get an Israeli in their pool, they basically have to accept a black card, so they travel however far, and then can't even fence. Sometimes they rearrange the bout order so that they would fence the Israeli last, and then he black carded, so that they at least get some pool bouts.  It's just bullshit politics, not the opinions of the fencers themselves."
Fencing,3dfjiw,venuswasaflytrap,2,Thu Jul 16 07:24:52 2015 UTC,Yes! Exactly! My Iranian Coach didn't care about Israel but she was followed around by the moral police and she never said what would happen or anything but

As I point out in their comments section:   I believe the ""parry ripost"" should be spelled ""parry riposte"". Additionally,  the execution of a ""parry riposte"" in fencing is usually two motions: one motion to block your opponents attack by displacing their blade away from your target and one motion to hit them. If you watch the replay, it is clear that Homer makes two motions to score."

Fencing,3de02s,joergisgodly,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:10:05 2015 UTC,Pretty sure it's for sports that require a uniform on top of the compression shirt which would add layers and make you hotter.

I know that if I have a long sleeved compression shirt on under my jacket, the sleeve slides around easier, possibly negating a touch (epee). However, I've never tried it because it seems like I would roast in my uniform. Maybe they just wear one sleeve to get the effect, but keep the other arm cooler?"

Fencing,3d727q,UselessFencingFacts,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:52:52 2015 UTC,I think a large part of the misses was down to Imre being left handed.  Especially considering how perfectly Grumier had been fencing up until the final.  Absolutely gutting.

I've heard about doing a gap analysis which makes sense but what tangible results should I base the gap off of?   I think the major problem here is that there isn't any direct comparison.  There isn't any objective, high level measuring stick.    If you're a USFA C-rated fencer with a 70% win rate in pools, how exactly do you compare that to a World Cup fencer in the top 64 of the world with a 70% win rate in pools?    You can't, really - you're fencing a different class of fencer.  And I'm not sure you can adjust things in a way that will make the results meaningful."

It's the same here when fencers ask ""how can I get out of round 1 of DE 's?"" Well that's not a good question to answer because it's too broad.  We would need to examine the performance and determine what's keeping them from advancing, then the question becomes 'how can I improve X Action?'"
Fencing,3d6gq8,twoslow,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:07:14 2015 UTC,Well yes but that isn't really what was asked exactly :p
Fencing,3d6gq8,noodlez,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:10:20 2015 UTC,"well true.  and I didn't mean that as a denial of your post, more about clarifying the purpose of gap analysis.  numbers don't mean anything if you're not asking the right question."
Fencing,3d6gq8,twoslow,3,Wed Jul 15 15:35:33 2015 UTC,"when we do a gap analysis at work, we use it to identify the gap between skills/knowledge/resources, and expected performance.  If performance must be XYZ, and that's not happening, for me it's a matter of determining why they're not able to perform XYZ.  do they not have the skill/ability?  Are their tools wrong?  Is it environment?  Is it personal limitation.  a simple example would be a fencer says ""I keep getting hit through my parry.""  So I need to identify is it a bad parry (not wide enough 4, for example), is it distance, is it timing?  something else? Once I figure out what's really happening, then i can direct them to work on that piece of the performance that is wrong."
Fencing,3d6gq8,twoslow,3,Tue Jul 14 06:19:44 2015 UTC,"Trying to figure out what measurable factors contribute the most to getting fencing results is difficult I think.   Points is not a great indicator. A guy that wins all his pool bouts 5-4, has a good chance of getting straight into the 64, even though a guy that wins 5 bouts 5-0 and loses a single bout 5-4 has a much better indicator. Similarly, winning 15-14 is just as good as 15-0.  Additionally, there is such a range of fencers, who make their touches in lots of different ways. I would wager that if you scatter plotted, say, the average speed on piste of different world class fencers you'd get no obvious pattern.  But I think that there probably could be some metrics of value. They might even be compound metrics - like, average speed/ripostes per minute or something.   I was coincidentally sat next to Ziemek on a flight. This guy is obsessed with metrics. He's really interested in the choice of action, and successful actions per bout. He's always got his little black book when he's coaching.  http://zfw-fencing.co.uk/articles/interview-ziemek-wojciechowski   Yes — since the timings have changed, foil has got slower so there's a general shift away from attacks, more parry-ripostes and fewer successful counter-attacks. Of course, there are exceptions: the current French team score about 60% of their hits from attacks and a high percentage of counter-attacks, whereas the Russians get a more balanced number of hits, with far more ripostes than the French. When you analyse the top fencers in the world, on average only around 40% of hits are scored from attacks and 60% from ripostes and counter-attacks. Within defensive actions, there are more successful ripostes than counter-attacks.   From what he said to me, I got the sense that he was interested in the trends of international fencing. And that if you get the optimal mix of actions, you'll achieve optimal results.  Kinda like this:  http://www.ewp.rpi.edu/hartford/~stoddj/BE/RandNash.htm  Things I would love to track if I could:   average steps per second (I suspect the ability to change direction is related to this) distance between fencers (I suspect that you could correlate a particular fencers wins with the distance they can maintain - i.e. some fencers do better if they can stay close, some if they can be far away) class of action choice (riposte/attack/counter), scoring/score against/no touch, time choice of target direction changes (I suspect that smaller fencers do better when they change directions more) acceleration blade contacts basic body metrics (height / weight / strength) of fencers   I don't know if any of these things would be revealing, but I'd love to look at the data if I could."
Fencing,3d6gq8,venuswasaflytrap,2,Tue Jul 14 11:17:39 2015 UTC,"Results fluctuate so much, I highly doubt it will be points, indicators, or results.  It has much more to do with the intangible aspects of the sport.  Maybe if you did some really in depth video analysis you might find something."
Fencing,3d6gq8,justin107d,2,Mon Jul 13 22:58:54 2015 UTC,I'd like to see a couple things. How often does a fencer come back from a bad seed out of pools to win/do very well? How does the first pool bout affect the rest? Does the winner of a bracket usually do better against the early fencers or the later ones? I think these data points could distinguish between top and middle level fencers

She said that the place she dances at for exercise is actually a fencing studio and it was just around the corner from where we were driving.  Five minutes later I was signed up for my first private lesson later that day. Three months later at my first tournament and one year later at the Nationals near LA.

I'd seen fencing at the Ren Faire before and it always looked so cool.  I looked around online and found 2 clubs in my area and picked the furthest one only because their scedule worked.

Well, I couldn't afford/didn't have time the classes at the time, so I had to pass.   Fast forward to college about 12 years later (I went late hah). I was an SI Leader (kinda a mix of tutor and TA) walking to my classroom and I saw a bunch of students out in the grass doing drills with foam sword things. I thought they were LARPers, so, naturally, I walked over to listen for some magic missile castings.   Once I got closer I saw an epee bellguard and my mind instantly clicked that it could be a fencing club. It was, and I sort of instantly remembered ""always wanting to try it.""

Tactical, technical, learning new things - perfecting an old favorite, maybe out smarting your coach?  What are your lessons like? Does your coach talk a lot? Or reserved in zen silence? Yelling? Positive or negative?  What's the worst thing about your lessons?"
Fencing,3crua6,hardwaregeek,5,Fri Jul 10 07:51:04 2015 UTC,"I love when my coach takes a preparation and shows me all the different situations that can come from it. My coach will give me a prep and expect me to react according to his actions. It's great when I respond perfectly and quickly. Also sometimes in the middle of a lesson we'll start messing around and trying to flick and feint to the hand and foot. It relieves tension, especially during a tough lesson. Make sure to take breaks if it's a long lesson. My coach gives 40-60 minute lessons that require a lot of precision. Without breaks it's very hard to achieve perfect precision for that length of time"

Fencing,3crua6,SephoraRothschild,3,Sat Jul 11 09:13:56 2015 UTC,"I've taken lessons from several coaches at several Clubs concurrently. Very diffferent styles:   Coach 1: No explanation, no verbal prompts. Action performed, I'm supposed to respond appropriately. These are the most frustrating because I'm supposed to figure it all out without guidance. Several years of this. I'm not sure if that's an appropriate expectation or not. I tend to argue a lot with him, because I try to verbalize what I think he's looking for, and what I'm thinking, and why I think it will/will not work.  Coach 2: Faster pace, more specific direction. Focus on brief overview of what is being sought out, with small verbal instruction. I don't argue with this guy.  Faster pace, very specific action. Guy has infinite patience. Extremely tight focus on tempo/timing (same as Coach 1, but even more extreme). No question is stupid.    I've just started working with him, and the other two coaches are okay with that. They're all using a ""joint-custody/it takes a village to raise a fencer over 35"" philosophy. So far, it's working."
Fencing,3crua6,BeardedFencer,3,Fri Jul 10 17:58:54 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed this explanation a lot and I am glad you are making it work with multiple coaches.  I hate the petty bs when coaches think they own the rights to your fencing.  I encourage my fencers to take lessons or go to camps at other places - it's good for Everyone and healthy.  It sucks to lose students - I've put blood sweat and tears into students and then They leave for a stronger more competitive coach. That hurts, I see why coaches want to protect themselves from getting hurt Like that but - it's for the better of Everyone in the long run right?  Anyway I ramble because I've been talking about this a lot and i dream of the day when every club and coach is welcoming and willing to teach anyone despite their club affiliation.  Thanks for the awesome comment."
Fencing,3crua6,SephoraRothschild,3,Sat Jul 11 09:19:23 2015 UTC,"Understand:  You can't just go about this with just any coach, or without a solid relationship to begin with. My primary coach and I have been working together since 2008. He's 72, has had four open heart surgeries, and still has a better lunge and a faster hand than most fencers a third of his age. He gives left-handed lessons because his right shoulder is worn out. He's still incredibly fast, but he's also aware that his body will fail him (again) at some point, for good. Valar Morghulis. He and the Egyptian coach have sorted this out and are fine with me seeing him. He and the Japanese coach are also on great terms, and the Japanese coach and the Egyptian coach and I discussed it a few months ago. Everyone is OK with it.   But again--you MUST be respectful, you MUST consider that when you are taking lessons that you take them according to the preference of the coach who is giving you the lesson. And you absolutely do not ever, ever, ever, do anything behind their back. You don't ask for discounts, and you don't disrespect them by saying ""But so-and-so does it this way"".  Honor your teacher, respect their time, and respect their methods.   FWIW, I'm a 90-minute drive from the closest one. So they all know and understand that. I'm extremely lucky to have them, and I definitely realize that this arrangement won't work for everybody.   I actually would contrast this with me switching CrossFit gyms as of this coming Tuesday. Box we have been at for five years changed ownership twice within the last two months, and we're not happy with the programming. So for our non-fencing salle training, my partner is going for 1:1 personal training from an international martial arts (shuai jiao) competitor, and I'm going to a much tougher CrossFit gym that split off from the original CF we belonged to (several years ago). So as with fencing clubs, there has to be the right timing, right circumstances, to modify your relationship. It's not just payments and business:  Always align with what you believe in, and what will get you the best results for the most honorable arrangement."
Fencing,3crua6,joergisgodly,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:41:36 2015 UTC,"I don't see whats wrong with ""but so and so does it this way"" sometimes coaches need to be questioned, sometimes the explanation  of why they want you to do it a certain way is very helpful. Understanding of an action is far better then the ability to repeat it in a lesson. For example one of my coaches was a Chinese women's foil olympian she's an amazing coach and fantastic at letting up strategic traps and being very sneaky as well as having one of the best foundation skills I've seen. While one of my other coaches is a 2 time Canadian mens foil olympian and sometimes they disagree with each other over small things they talk it out and decide whats best for my style. It's not always disrespectful to ask why one way is better for  you then another. If done in a proper way."
Fencing,3crua6,KRiPPeR,2,Sun Jul 12 22:02:14 2015 UTC,"I like the moment of ""ok, that's fine, let's make things more complicated now"". It makes me feel like I'm fencing in proper form.   I tend to ask him to focus on technique. In one of the clubs I train we only do combat fencing, and in the other one most of the exercises are for beginners, so I have very little chance to do drills that would improve my footwork, distance, point control, etc.  My current coach is very zen. He tries to lead with the blade, rather than words, and I really like that. Every drill is presented as a problem that I must solve on my own. He will give tidbits of advice every now and then or share some fencing stories of his other students and/or when he used to fence, which I also enjoy.  What I don't like is that the sessions are quite short, and only once a week. I wish I had more money to have them more often."
Fencing,3crua6,BeardedFencer,2,Fri Jul 10 10:04:23 2015 UTC,"Awesome!   My first coach was very quiet - sometimes the whole lesson he wouldn't say anything, or maybe just to tell me to relax.  It, like you said, was a puzzel to be unlocked.  My current coach lays everything out and is very meticulous - I love both styles and I see the benefit to both!  I like knowing what others think of their lessons too.  I know what you mean - I can only get a lesson once a week as well, so we try to make it long which is exhausting haha."

Fencing,3crua6,venuswasaflytrap,3,Fri Jul 10 14:51:42 2015 UTC,"Exactly right? How indeed?  I think probably just standing in front of anyone with a sword, and performing fencing actions on them is probably useful to some extent. It seems unlikely that you can really do a lot to make a person worse, as long as you're not doing extremely odd actions (like teaching someone to habitually run into the point of the other guy other something). I think as long as the student is making touches on the coach it's going to be net-positive. I mean, at the very least, it builds hand strength, and give practice just touching the target.  But if we make ""Standing in front of a guy holding a sword, and beating/not beating the blade and hitting them randomly"", the ""null hypothesis"" baseline, what makes a lesson actually useful (which is to say, more useful than a randomly moving target with a sword)?  I think it's quite hard to say. I also think there are a lots of directions that you can take with it - but it's like asking ""what's a good meal"". It can be lots of things. Steak can be good, or awful. Sometimes you hot food is good, sometimes bad. Sometimes sweet is good, sometimes bitter is good. It's difficult to say what 'a good lesson' is without some sort of context I think."
Fencing,3crua6,BeardedFencer,3,Fri Jul 10 15:01:33 2015 UTC,"Very true! I realize the subjective nature of the questions I just like to know how other people take their coffee. =D  I think it does depend on context to what makes a lesson good or great. The needs of the student dictate the lesson for the most part.   I have been afraid to give lessons to ""higher"" level fencing because I am afraid I have nothing to teach them. What I'm realizing is exactly what you said just standing in front of someone and Hitting and working on tightening up actions and strengthening the hand and feet, working on timing. I don't have to teach them knew things - just to work at a higher intensity to perfect actions is a good lesson.  But like I said - i just like to know what other People like about their lessons."

Fencing,3crua6,BeardedFencer,2,Fri Jul 10 17:09:38 2015 UTC,Its a style of coaching - one of my coaches would just present a problem and hit you with it.

If we're talking about just doing sets of lunges then it is zero unless I have been making a technique error that I'm trying to iron out.  Why are you lunging that many times? Conditioning?

Fencing,3crua6,BeardedFencer,2,Fri Jul 10 22:21:18 2015 UTC,You don't want to have unbalanced muscles because it can become painful and weird looking.  So you should balance out the training you do on at least a little on both legs.

Fencing,3crua6,FractalBear,2,Sun Jul 12 10:38:33 2015 UTC,"Some people do a limited amount of off-hand footwork/bladework, but at best that's going to only mitigate since you're still doing vastly more work with the main hand.  Most competitive fencers do some sort of cross training and/or gym work outs. In terms of gym workouts, you'll gain a higher level of strength and at a quicker rate then just from doing a bunch of fencing, and consequently it will minimize asymmetry much better."
Fencing,3crua6,SephoraRothschild,2,Sun Jul 12 18:00:27 2015 UTC,"My personal rationale: When one trains only one half, you're ending up with asymmetrically-toned muscles. One side stronger than the other, yes; but imbalanced. Try doing pistol squats on your leading leg, then your off-leg. Huge difference in reps/strength. The Japanese coach I've been seeing makes us drill on both (during the warmup class, which is as difficult as some fencing camps/CrossFit WoDs I've done).  I've definitely a weakness there.   And of course, the secondary, much more petty reason:  I'm a woman, and having lopsided legs simply will.not.do."
Fencing,3crua6,justin107d,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:33:23 2015 UTC,"Asymmetry is known to lead to injuries.  The reason being is all your muscles cris-cross over your joint and connect with other muscles more than you realize.  If a strong muscle engages a weak one in the chain, it can lead to a pull or tear."
Fencing,3crua6,BeardedFencer,2,Sat Jul 11 16:50:29 2015 UTC,Way closer to zero than 200. =C  I have to demonstrate the lunge like a hundred times a day but.. Not the same.
Fencing,3crua6,LarsSeprest,2,Fri Jul 10 23:33:27 2015 UTC,You should just do squats or deadlifts?  Or does your footwork session just last that long.  I would think 50-75 through footwork and drills would be good.  Can even do barbell lunges.
Fencing,3crua6,SephoraRothschild,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:17:13 2015 UTC,"...I don't ""just"" do anything. I already CrossFit in addition to fencing. Squats, deadlifts and DU's are not foreign to me (though my DL max is stalled at 175# at present).  Interestingly, a student of my Japanese coach left yesterday at the end of Saturday practice, and came back during my partner's lesson. He and his father were having a disagreement over whether the kid (16) STILL had to do the 400 lunges that day since he had spent the whole day in Seppuku Warmup Class and lessons. Coach said yes. So I more or less got my answer there. :)"
Fencing,3crua6,joergisgodly,2,Sun Jul 12 19:45:17 2015 UTC,400 lunges doesn't seem that helpful. Theres no way the kid is going to do 400 explosive lunges that translate into ones needed in a bout. Was it a punishment?

Fencing,3crua6,joergisgodly,3,Mon Jul 13 00:13:43 2015 UTC,I'm a 17-year-old B15 foilist ;) and if you can do 400 of something those aren't your best 400... you said you did lead lift and squats right? Can you do 20 (not even close to 400) reps of your max weight? Or is somewhere around 4-6 ( you do 4 or 5 lets which is 30 max) more realistic when doing a challenging weight? Doing 400 reps builds muscle endurance but also promotes slow twitch muscles. If he did 40 sets of 10 it might be helpful but still quite a large amount. Practice makes perfect only if you practice perfectly.
Fencing,3crua6,LarsSeprest,3,Mon Jul 13 00:37:10 2015 UTC,"Here, here  The ""you must do 10,000 of X to master iX"" philosophy has been dead for years, with science debunking it.  Gotta move more weight in less time over a distance to train those explosive lunges.   Sephora, I think we are just saying that time spent doing 400 lunges is at a comparative disadvantage to other activities for your time spent at the fencing club, unless the person is a beginner who does not have the mechanics of the lunge down."

Fencing,3crua6,Wertilq,2,Sat Jul 11 14:38:48 2015 UTC,"When facing opposite handers, your 6 is weaker while your 4 is stronger. Your strong side is always inwards, and when you face same handers as yourself, you will have your weak against their weak, and your strong against their strong.  When facing opposite handers, if you push inwards, they need to push outwards. My favorite is thus a feint trying to force them making a 4-parry, and then counter-4 bind to lunge."

Fencing,3cnf5g,BeardedFencer,5,Thu Jul 9 07:22:54 2015 UTC,The lunge is too complicated for me to run through on mobile but.  Make sure you land your front foot heal first then the rest of the foot. If done right it eliviates stress and should be close to silent.   Front knee should be directly over ankle - this is safest and best balance.  Hold the lunge often and make sure you are balanced.   Fencing is about muscle memory - if you practice unbalanced you will fence without balance. IE practice slow enough that you can do it perfect.  You need a coach for this stuff - timing can't be learned through reading.  L2disengage with a tennis ball on a string - get it swinging and avoid it. Can also attack it for point control.   Disengage it and it a target on the other side.  Be creative - the best thing you could do though is work on conditioning.   Squats - planks - core and legs.  Sprints to gain stamina  Flexibility in your whole body  Some footwork.  Don't teach yourself bad habits in the off season. =P
Fencing,3cnf5g,WildZontar,2,Thu Jul 9 07:40:04 2015 UTC,"In addition to what BeardedFencer said, I'd like to mention that for right now don't worry about speed. Worry about control and technique. It is easy to do faster something you know how to do well. It's hard to improve the technique of something you do poorly while doing it quickly. If you have trouble maintaining control while doing something fast, I suspect you either still need to practice technique or need to do more conditioning."

Fencing,3cnf5g,Wertilq,6,Thu Jul 9 20:28:13 2015 UTC,"I have done self practice over a summer or so. It get tedious very fast, many things simply are not possible to practice alone.  What you can practice is your basic footwork, lunges, guards, some parries and precision.  Something I made when I practiced was to put a tennisball on a long string, and hung it up. This allowed me to practice my lunges and attacks on a small moving target. Try attacking from different angles, and try to make parries in the air, just to improve your precision.  Currently over summer me and a chick practice together. And that is what I much more can recommend. Try to find a practice partner, someone you get along with, which have a good attitude towards training, and is as interested as you are. Even if your skill-level is decently far apart, it is still fine, as long as you get along. It will be a HUGE improvement over going at it alone. Together you can do bouts, you can do pair training, you can set up practice situations etc etc. There simply is no limits.  I highly recommend you find a person you practice with, you just need some place to be, and have your own weapons and ""armours"" and rest is fine."

I know how it feels to have other commitments in the way or simply not being allowed to fence.   Also, you're missing a flair--I can't tell what weapon you fence with!! :)   Do watch fencing on youtube from FIE, CyrusofChaos, sydneysabrecentre, etc, etc because not only will you see interesting things, as everyone else has mentioned, you will hear attractive people in knee-high socks screaming too. It's a great way to watch people make comebacks or struggle to keep a lead, or improve directing skills, or look at tactic shifts.   I do footwork in the garage and focus on control over speed most of the time. Speed will come naturally--at least for me. I also focus on not fencing on my toe so much. Lots of fencers fence on their toes, but for me, it's starting to wear a certain ligament in the outer part of my back ankle. Don't practice mistakes....yada yada yada.   Additionally, I go on hasfit.com for the 90 day warrior workout routine. Or sprints. Whatever you have time for.   Please study for the SATs or you'll flip out during college admissions like I did! Best of luck! School's important too!   Edit:   There are nice blogs out there...  showmethedata.com.au has some great (and hilarious) material from the sydneysabre folks if you fence sabre.   http://www.lelandguillemin.com/world-championship-preparation.html Go Leland!   there are more out there too but i'm lazy right now  WORLD FENCING CHAMPIONSHIPS IN MOSCOW ARE BEING STREAMED LIVE ON THE FIE YOUTUBE CHANNEL SO IF YOU HAVE TIME WATCH IT BECAUSE THERE'S A TON OF FUN FROM 14-14 BOUTS TO TOTAL UPSETS TO LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE.

Aiming is hard.  If you can get a post with a hole in it, you can stick a foil tang in it and use it to practice beat attacks, disengages, and taking the blade.

Firstly, gently and slightly raise your right foot up, and move it away from the left foot by half a pace, and placing make that the whole body is supported thereon, and at the same time raise your wrist and foil high, in première guard, or prime, as you please.   Secondly, you will make the salute with the left foot, putting the left hand to the hat, and uncovering yourself, bringing it low to the side of the knee, the inside turned towards him, and while making this reverence you must carry the foot smoothly in rounding and turning the point thereof to the outside, carrying and removing the left side back, so that the ankle of the same foot is located behind the right heel, where placing it there you will balance your body so that it is supported thereon.  Thirdly, you will raise your right foot, carry it and place it forward, its point towards your adversary.   Fourth, you will make a step forward with the left foot, so that the ankle of that foot is located in front of the point of the right foot, replacing your hat on your head, and lowering your wrist and foil in seconde, without lowering the body at all.  And fifth, you will advance with the right foot and put yourself on guard and posture in the manner we have taught; and note that in making this reverence, you must not lower the head or bend the body, as in the bows of civility that one makes: on the contrary you must stand upright well, in order to look fixedly at your opponent and consider his guard and posture, in order to form the plans we wish to execute while doing this.  Many people make their salute another way: but each faces it as they see fit, because it is nothing but a small ceremony that does nothing to the foundation of this science. After having made your salute to your opponent, which you will have similarly received, and you both being put in guard in the fifth time, you will very subtly narrow the measure while considering his guard and posture.  But you must be certain that no one can hold his guard but in one of these four ways, namely, high or low, or in the middle, who is covering himself with his sword, in quarte or in tierce , and you must not get yourself in trouble for this, expected that they are easy to engage the ones as the others, for in these four different guards, you have to make at them in each engagement: But you must have a good foot, good eye, good wrist, and good judgement, with all the dispositions of the body required to properly execute the tempi, counter-tempi, and counters to the counter, with agility, vigour and speed."

Lastly it should be finished with a slash, telling opponent you'll send them to hell.  I have not found a proper source for this at all, so I doubt all of it is true.  I found a description of a slightly more complex salute  And a video of another one  Neither describe the history though, they are just more proper and complex."

Fencing,3cfken,venuswasaflytrap,2,Tue Jul 7 22:30:39 2015 UTC,"This is purely accendotal, but what I gathered is that at least part of the salute is intended to show both the top and bottom of your blade to your opponent. This way the opponent and his secondant can check the blade to see if it is dirty or serrated. Duels were supposed to be honourable (at least to some extent) and duels to the death were banned at some point, because too many aristocrats found untimely deaths in duels. Wound infections are kind of uncool and unsporting."
Fencing,3cfken,invincible_spleen,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:45:42 2015 UTC,"Interesting, I've heard similar ones before as well. Not about poison/dirt or similar, but at least showing the blade, so opponent could check out and confirm what kind of weapon you had etc, overall it being connected to honour.  I didn't find any proper sources confirming it either. It's the issue I've had so far, there is just no confirmations of any theories, just several more or less plausible ones."

Fencing,3cfken,LarsSeprest,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:12:07 2015 UTC,"This is very true. Dueling is much much older than the aristocratic dueling the modern fencing is mainly based upon, and it might be true that some of traditions with the dueling might be older than that then."
Fencing,3cfken,perivane,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:04:26 2015 UTC,"There can be little doubt that this fashion of always bringing the hilt to the lips after drawing the sword  originated in the habit of kissing the cross formed by blade and guard whenever the sword had to be unsheathed.  Similarly, it must be supposed that the curious form of salute when “marching past,” namely, that of drawing the hilt across the mouth and extending the arm towards the saluting point, is a remnant of the very ancient ceremony of wafting a kiss with the sword hand to the gallery of fair ladies, previously to taking part in the lists or tournaments.   -Schools and Masters of Fence: From the Middle ages to the Eighteenth Century  It doesn't give primary sources though"

In a normal bout you'd be able to afford the odd double hit regardless of its impact on the score. However if a double hit is an instant loss then it changes the game dramatically.   I think it stems from my utter loathing of the beat parry. Making an actual solid parry is less important than getting blade contact and a fast riposte, even if all you did was redirect the blade from your head to your neck."

We never had enough epeeists to justify épée and next to no one besides me and two other people fence saber so that wouldn't happen, but the rules would be the same, someone legally hits your target area, you're dead. Another variant called bridge is another we use which might fit your ideas better. Basically a long strip with people on either side. Get hit and you're out, the next person has to rush so your opponent doesn't just hit the end of the strip and declare victory. It's a fun game, I feel like saber would be pretty simple. Doubles either don't count or out both people, and whoever gets hit first loses. Not familiar enough with one touch épée to guess any more"
Fencing,3cb4vl,shaybah,2,Mon Jul 6 15:31:45 2015 UTC,"One touch epee is what they use for fencing in modern pentathalon.  It's literally just a bout to one point; i.e. first touch wins.

It was humbling to get destroyed by 15 year old GIRLS in my matches, but since fencing is basically their life, you realize to many that it is not worth it and that balance is a better way to go.  Korea can be like this in a lot of regards.  Still, I had a lot of great bouts I fondly remember.  I beat the school's ""ace"" once, ONCE with some insane touches I pulled off.

Because Europe is such a strong region for fencing, qualifying out of Europe is a bloodbath.  You have fencers that changed their representation to another country in order to qualify for the Olympics due to being able to compete out of another zone. Are they suddenly better fencers? No, but they do get to qualify out of a weaker zone."

AF and FP used to sell them, but they seem to be off their site.   I haven't tried an FIE  STM, just the FIE N. Have you used both? If you have, what's the difference?

Fencing,3c8muu,charkins,2,Mon Jul 6 03:12:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's why I liked Vnitis. They lasted forever and could withstand even the roughest beginner. My coach however said that a few experienced fencers broke their vnitis rather quickly"

But then again,  it's not usually directed at the opponent, which might make the difference. Yelling at your opponent and yelling in their general direction is different. That being said, it's a good idea to yell away from the ref and opponent if you're going to yell. I personality yell at the floor when I do yell (which is fairly often haha)."

If they're allowed to yell, you're allowed to mock them. Every time they do the huge ""AHHHHHPAAAAHHH!"", you do a tiny ""woohoo"" with prancing and dinosaur arms.  I did this once in a big bout years ago, when I still fenced foil. You would not believe how it got under my opponent's skin. The ref gave me a look, I said if he can yell, I can yell. It totally took him out of his game, it was great. I mean, I still lost, but I was going to lose anyway, and this guy hated me for months after that, which was good because he was an enormous douche.   Anyway, just an idea. Anytime someone is doing something loud and self-congratulatory and Very Serious, you can point out how ridiculous they're being and usually win that (social) encounter. Who wins the fencing after that is up to you."

Fencing,3c6cis,FractalBear,3,Sun Jul 5 19:00:34 2015 UTC,"If someone is yelling in your face, then they should be warned as well. Your initial post didn't specify that so I assumed the person was yelling loud and often, but not in your face."

It's an attempt to sway the ref and to intimidate the opponent.   A yell after a good touch is fine. But if I think it's gone so far that I can make fun of it, I will. If I get a warning for that, ok. He's trying to get in my head (and in your head). If I can depower that and take him out of his comfort zone, great.  The basis for what one might call 'decorum' rules in fencing is that we're supposed to be (ladies and) gentlemen, or something like that. But saying you can't yell felt 'anti-athletic'. Ok. But if this idiot is screaming his lungs out at every white light, decorum is out the window. If he makes himself vulnerable to me pointing out he's a clown, well..."

My next touch I took in an adult-sized lungful, put my hands on my hips all sassy, and screamed until my voice petered out due to lack of air.  The spectators laughed and her yelling didn't bother me after that, so I guess it worked."

You have got to HTFU, and mentally decide to stop getting distracted by this behavior by your opponent and/or stop hoping the ref will regulate your opponent's behavior.

Aside from the unofficial rules, it's not well-regulated, and referees tend not to do more work than they have to unless the fencer has sufficiently annoyed them.  If the yelling's getting to you, it's doing what your opponent wants it to do. I end up yelling a lot to ease tension, myself, but I've seen lots of people use it to game the ref. I've been a ref and had a fencer pass by me while   My personal school of thought when it comes to yelling is that the more that they yell at you, the more you yell back. This goes both ways, of course - I've had people get irritated by my yelling and start yelling at me. At that point, that bout just became a yelling match, and I irritated my team captain to the point that he refuses to acknowledge I won."

As a foreign fencer, I see fie is not tracked yet, and I have no idea really what I could do with the service. Is the ui useable for my needs? Will this thing even be useful to me?  I suggest you create a trial mode. It can even be fundamentally crippled, like, data is only saved for 2 weeks or a month or something. But it needs to showcase all the features, so that new users can use the interface, record some bouts or whatever, to see if it's actually a tool they want to have.  That way, the decision to buy can be made after using the thing for a week or two, and the user can think ""gosh this has been really useful"", rather than being forced to make the decision at the beginning and thinking ""gosh, I hope there is something useful here"".

I want to arrive at a product people will be interested in ASAP.  demo mode is on the roadmap.

Fencing,3bytgb,Darth_Dread,7,Fri Jul 3 17:22:12 2015 UTC,Usually no blade.  hmmmm why?    Reason 1. Groups.  I Don't wear a mask when I'm doing footwork and I don't want a bunch of people waving blades in my face when I don't have a mask on.  This allows the instructor to be in front of a class speaking clearly without the muffling effects of a mask.  Reason 2. Hard Work.  Foot work is the most athletic and tiring part of fencing.  By stripping down to just shorts and t-shirt you can get more footwork done before tiring.  Reason 3. Exceptions are the rule!  Sometimes doing footwork with a blade is necessary.  As a beginner I likely did footwork 70% no blade / 30% blade.  Footwork with the blade to build up shoulder and arm muscles. Practice co-ordination of blade and feet. Teach beginners how to move while holding a blade.

Fencing,3bytgb,brohabulus,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:08:40 2015 UTC,"EDIT: Thanks a bunch for the informative replies, everyone! Nice to hear people have experienced the opposite, because this was starting to really get into my head on strip. Probably just need to chill out and get back to effective practice. Also thinking /u/Stabby_fencer is onto something and maybe I just need to pull apart my frenches and dial them in. Thanks again, all!  I have a few general questions about french gripping in epee. For some background info, I fenced french for awhile competitively but recently came back to pistol.    Do you guys feel that opposite handedness is a huge disadvantage for posting? I'm a leftie, and when you're a mirror image, arms become the closest body part and it can be immensely difficult to get the point on with a french grip. Any sort of incidental blade contact can get them a lucky double even if you got them on distance/timing/prep. Do any of you have tips or advice for how to make the most of french grip as a leftie? I love french, so I'm sorely tempted to just switch to right handed. I always found it incredibly easy to beat other lefties with french, despite rarely getting to fence them (you'd expect a lower winrate then--but this is all anecdotal anyways) What about grips? Everyone talks about the advantages/disadvantages of different pistol grips, but what about french? What materials are best for what, how do different pommels  effect your fencing, what are the most commonly used grips/pommels, etc. I've also heard that the width of your grip in relation to handsize is important, something about wider grips being for larger hands (which I thought odd--barring those with exceptionally small hands, wouldn't a larger grip allow for a looser hold on it and make it easier to angle/manipulate?"
Fencing,3bytgb,Darth_Dread,4,Fri Jul 3 09:54:51 2015 UTC,"Opposite handedness for a posting Epeeist is generally a great advantage, as stated by u/KatonRyu. A French handle is composed of three parts: exterior material, interior material, and pommel.   Exterior Material  Common wrapping materials you'll find are: leather, rubber, wood, hard plastic, soft plastic,  tape, ...  This one is easy.  It comes down to personal preference -- what feels good to you.  Actually I'd say the covering is the least important consideration of a french handle.  Interior Material the most important element  The interior material determines the flexibility, strength, durability, handling, longevity, and weight of the handle.  And, can completely change the feel of a blade.  Commonly used materials and their strengths and weakness IMHO:  Soft Plastic likely covered in rubber: Light weight, very flexible, no durability, very soft. I could never get soft plastic handles attached tightly enough that they wouldn't move around the tang.  I find they give very poor sense of the point and the blade, generally a very sloppy feel to the blade.  The only structure and strength come form the tang of the blade itself.  The handle adds no extra stiffness.  -- Leave this handle to beginners.  Wood likely covered with leather: mid-weight, mid-stiffness, low/medium durability. With a wooden handle you can get them tight enough that they should feel much less sloppy then soft plastic.  Point and blade control is good.  This handle adds some extra stiffness to the tang -- important for flick hits where you want to control how your blade bends.  However, if you want to put extreme bends in your tang, you will easily break the handle.  Hard/Thermo plastic likely solid plastic without additional covering: low/mid weight, mid-stiffness. These handles tried to replicate some of the advantages of the wood handles.  Sorry, I haven't much experience with them.  Metal/Aluminum Rubber covering: stiff, strong, durable, mid to high weight. Great point and blade control.  Handle adds much stiffness to the tang giving a very solid feeling to the blade.  If you have the strength, you can contort (shape, bend) the handle as you see fit.  Durability: like a rock.  The only thing I every managed to do was damage the rubber covering when I put it in a vice to bend it.  Pommel:  Pommels are now available in a variety of shapes, sizes and weights.  This will allow you to balance the weight of your choice of handle.  Most people like the balance point of the blade as close to the front of  the guard as possible, without making the weapon too heavy.  Leon Paul introduced pommels that bent independent of the tang -- they are very expensive, last time I looked.  I think pommels are going to come down to personal choice matching its size and shape to your preference and its weight will depend on your choice of blade, guard and handle."
Fencing,3bytgb,KatonRyu,3,Fri Jul 3 19:39:19 2015 UTC,"I can only answer the first question with any degree of accuracy: No, I don't feel that opposite handedness is a disadvantage. If anything I'd consider an advantage. The arm is closer, and with a French grip your reach is longer. Using distance and disengages you can hit your opponent on the hand relatively easily with low risk. I'm a lefty and I fenced French for four years before switching to pistol grip, and I've always had a much easier time against right-handers.   As for the second question...I really don't know. I've only ever used uncanted, basic grips so I don't know the merits of one French handle over another."
Fencing,3bytgb,Stabby_fencer,3,Fri Jul 3 10:15:01 2015 UTC,"I have always fenced with french grip. Not left handed so I can't really comment on that, though I don't see why it would be any different.  As for grips it is a case of different strokes for different folks. I would suggest you steer clear of the shitty plastic grips that usually come as standard though - they are a one way trip to snapping the grip, or worse the tang. My own grips are made from hardwood with metal collars at either end and I like them. They are a fair bit chunkier than the basic grips, but not as chunky as the leon paul tennis racquet style ones. I gather a lot of the top fencers use the scherma sport grips but they can be a bit of a mission to get hold of. My own are fairly curved anyway so I haven't bothered tracking one down to try.  Pommels are also a case of fining a combination of size and weight that you like - I prefer them fairly heavy.  I think trying to fence posting without a correct set is pretty much pissing into the wind. Down and to the left for me (right for you as a leftie). Really helps with keeping the point on target and helps get the angulation you need."
Fencing,3bytgb,K_S_ON,2,Fri Jul 3 12:47:53 2015 UTC,"No. Lots of very good posting lefties. For the rest, find a good french grip coach and take some lessons. Even a few will give you a good idea where your hand should be and what to work on. It's really important to have a stiff grip. Cheap flexy grips make your whole weapon wobbly, and eventually you will break the tang of the weapon. PBT aluminum core are very good, Coach Reith grips aluminum core are very good, more curved and a bit fatter, the LP carbon grip is good if you like a very light epee but IMO is too big, I've heard very good things about the Harut grips but I haven't tried them yet.    Seriously, most french grips are crap. I think a good middle of the road aluminum core grip is the PBT, if you don't have a strong feeling I'd try one of those."

I managed to win all my matches in the morning (even the most difficult ones), but got completely obliterated by the end by people I felt I should've given a better combat.  I am not sure if it is something physical or mental, but it is not the first time it happens... Everytime, my fencing in the afternoon is not so good: legs are heavier, actions are ""dirtier"", I plaque in most of my flicks...

Fencing,3bu77o,BeardedFencer,1 point,Sat Jul 4 08:17:39 2015 UTC,"First, it's a stronger grip (if you had two grips screwed into the ceiling, which would you rather hang from?)  But more importantly, if you grip it really hard, it still points in the right direction.  The (non-pommeling/posting) french grip argument, is that it forces you to use your fingers and grip the blade softly - which is kinda true, because if you grip a french grip to hard, it becomes a hammer-grip, your point goes up at the ceiling (or wall or floor depending on the pronation of your hand), and you can't hit anything.  What I don't understand is how that gets framed as an advantage. Every time you make the small mistake of gripping too tight, you get scored on? That's not goood!"

Once we were there, they decided to switch it to electric. Had to borrow a foil from the club, and being left-handed, they only one they had that it was working was a french grip weapon.  Fencing with it felt very different, had to switch my style quite a bit (no flicking, shorter preparations), but still managed to finish first place. Only had problems with one guy that parries and beats like highlander, which made it difficult to keep the weapon in line."

Fencing,3bu77o,JRossS,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:45:31 2015 UTC,"He won, 8-7 I think. Checking now I think it was Philippe Bennett, vet60 foil.  edit: I was wrong, it's Lou Mariani, as FractalBear pointed out. The names are blurry on the machine behind them (next time I'm bringing a better camera!), but at least I should have been able to read Lou and Philippe. It was a close bout, went into overtime tied 7-7 iirc."
Fencing,3bu77o,ironweaver,0,Thu Jul 2 04:56:18 2015 UTC,"He is holding it wrong. You should hold it like this. I used to have this grip on my foil for quite some time (there were no pistol grips for us during that period in Russia).  We had to make our own. They weren't so comfortable as ""factory made"" but a lot better than french grips.  P.S. There is also italian grip. I've never seen someone using it."
Fencing,3btx0l,TheFencingCoach,12,Thu Jul 2 03:01:54 2015 UTC,"Today, Sir Nicholas Winton (pictured) died at the age of 106 years old. Yes, 106.  During the Holocaust, Winton was responsible for saving the lives of nearly 700 Jewish children. Because of his selfless and heroic efforts, it is estimated that 15,000 Jews are able to continue life.  The Talmud reads: ""he who saves the life of one, saves the world entire.""  What a life this hero has lived, and if heaven exists, he has a first class ticket there."

Fencing,3bclcc,chaitin,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:49:19 2015 UTC,Should they? What did they do wrong exactly? It sounds like they applied the rules correctly.
Fencing,3bclcc,venuswasaflytrap,4,Mon Jun 29 21:55:45 2015 UTC,"Reading it, what I gather is that non-combativity was called during the final bout. The Swiss team - and the referee - assumed that since the scores were tied that this lead to a priority minute. However, the rules state that non-combativity does NOT lead to priority; it leads to a priority-ish final minute of fencing, where whoever has the highest score at the end of the minute wins. ""Priority"" is still assigned in case of a tie at the end of the minute, but it's not fenced sudden-death style like a regular priority minute. The minute is fenced fully. It seems that the Swiss team thought they moved to regular priority and won with their touch, but in reality they still had 32 seconds of fencing left."
Fencing,3bclcc,Rythoka,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:52:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think you're right. The ref should have been more on top of it, but it's also a weird rule."

Fencing,3bclcc,venuswasaflytrap,2,Wed Jul 1 21:36:35 2015 UTC,"My guess is it wasn't an epee ref. I think it is a very straight forward rule, but you have to know it in the first place and many people don't."
Fencing,3bclcc,FractalBear,2,Tue Jun 30 22:17:09 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure exactly what went wrong (of course).  It's probably one of:    Calling non-combativity and then ending the bout before the final minute completed  Not calling non-combativity when he should have  Letting the third minute end with 18 seconds on the clock, rather than letting time run all the way down (showing that the bout went to time)"
Fencing,3bclcc,chaitin,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:54:36 2015 UTC,"The rules don't stipulate that non-combativity can't be called within the last minute, so what was the ref to do?"
Fencing,3bclcc,venuswasaflytrap,2,Tue Jun 30 15:35:16 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised you don't think the referee made an error considering the fallout.  Surely there's SOMETHING he could have done to prevent this disaster. I'd like to think that this wasn't an unavoidable situation that we will see every time two fencers decide to wait out 18 seconds in the last period of a team match.  In any case, this aspect of the rules is irrelevant.  If the referee was calling non-combativity (which he can), he should have clearly stated it.  If the referee was not calling non-combativity, he should have clearly stated it, and probably let the clock run down.  Knowing the details of what happened would make the actual place where mistakes were made more clear."
Fencing,3bclcc,chaitin,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:52:44 2015 UTC,Something obviously went wrong. What I don't understand was what exactly it was.

This video apparently is just an anomaly.  If the referee called non-combativity in the final minute, then it would be going against convention. If not, then why was their confusion over it?  So how is it possible for the referee to screw up at Baku? I hope it wasn't something ridiculous, like both fencers saluting and stepping back with twenty seconds left in the bout."

Fencing,3bclcc,venuswasaflytrap,1 point,Sun Jun 28 08:22:56 2015 UTC,It looks like there were 32 seconds left in priority.  I guess there was confusion as to whether the priority was called by non-combativity or because it was tied 38-38.

Edit: if there is some kind of tryout period or process, I bet you would improve your chances by showing up with your cardio and sprint endurance at a high level.  I remember my first few college practices really emphasized this and tried to separate fencers who were willing to work and had atheletic ability from those who did not.  There is still time to run some intervals/windsprints before the fall."
Fencing,3b61x5,white_light-king,2,Fri Jun 26 22:18:30 2015 UTC,If you are female you will be on any roster with a men's team as well. Due to title 9 they flood women's rosters to allow more men on the men's side. You may not get any traveling bouts depending on who else is there but you will be on the roster and at practice.
Fencing,3b61x5,1Harrier1,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:59:02 2015 UTC,I think this practice has diminished since a 2009 court decision http://news.yahoo.com/quinnipiac-settlement-sheds-light-title-ix-compliance-100054400.html  and women's fencing rosters are a lot smaller now than they were 2000ish when I was in school.  I wouldn't take it for granted at every school.

I'm at a rather large and renowned club, which is however almost exclusively dedicated to sabre: being a foilist, I get to fence with only 3-4 opponents on a weekly basis.  Will move to London next Autumn though, where I hope to find a bigger club for foil. I don't know how easy it will be to match the level of expertise of the coaches down here (most of them have trained Italian gold medalists)."
Fencing,3b5yh9,Teeteto04,2,Fri Jun 26 10:06:46 2015 UTC,"London has a few main foil clubs.  ZFW: This is Ziemecks club, and is quite strong. Lots of good fencers, everyone is very nice. Ziemeck has one of the best track records of any foil coach in the world right now, with 2 fencers in the top 25. The style of the club is quite transient though, since Ziemeck often has to go to world cups to support his fencers, among other places. If you're holding down a job, it's a little intermittent, but if you have a lot of free time, they often do things in the day and at random times. This might be changing though, cus they're quite new and are becoming more established.  Sussex House: This club is attached to a boys school and for adult fencers, this club is invite only, and has a good bunch of fairly strong fencers. I haven't been there for a while, so I don't know who's there at the moment, but historically they've had a strong group. They have a good coach, but their venue is tiny. 4 half length pistes crammed really tightly together. When I went, it was a very ""you get a text message to know if it's open that night"" sort of club.  Leon Paul Training center: This is where the national team trains and operates in the day. It's obviously world class. I suspect if you are a fairly strong fencer you can manage to spar with them, and I know a few people who do that, but it's open during normal work hours, not in evenings.  Salle Boston: This is my club, and is definitely one of the strongest 'conventional' foil clubs. You pay a fee, and it runs 3 evenings a week. You show up, do footwork, and fencer electric while coaches give lessons. On any given night there will be a 3-6 top 50ish to top 20ish (UK) quality fencers. It's quite expensive, but lessons are included, and Tomek is a good coach.  Newham swords: I've never fenced at this club, but sometimes their fencers come to salle boston. They have a small group of strong Juinors. I don't know what the club culture is like though, but the coaches are both very good, and have a good track record. I think they're mostly a young club though.  There are lots of other places to fence, and some decent fencers in some of the university clubs and some of the other clubs, plus London always has various foreigners, so there are always strong fencers wandering through. You can always organize something. PM if you want me to give you any contacts or help you out when you get here."

Fencing,3b22al,twoslow,4,Thu Jun 25 22:12:11 2015 UTC,"So, I'll elaborate on why this thread was created.  This thread was originally created to solve the problem of ""what gear should I get""? In the world of fencing, often the only way to solve some basic non-fencing (and even at times, fencing) related questions is with voodoo magic.  The idea is simple. Top fencers use good gear. That much is obvious. But what gear is good? I was surprised Eurofencing made the list, when fencing.net would seem to imply that it is not top quality. While a lot of gear selection is made based on regional distribution and sponsorships, often times the reason a fencer goes away from them is interesting. Why, for example, does an Italian go for Allstar, instead of Negrini or Carmimari? Why does an American go for Allstar, even after being sponsored by Leon Paul? Why does no one use Prieur? And why does the FIE not even publish a list of homologated fencing clothing? Unless a top level fencer wears the gear to a competition, it is impossible for someone to even know if the uniform is legal!  While all of this is interesting, there is one simple fact: The only company that is passably competent at advertising is Allstar. While there certainly is an allure to German made gear, questions have to be asked - since when were the Germans known for their tailoring? And even then, Allstar/Uhlmann was bought out by the Chinese! (Why does everyone go for Allstar instead of Uhlmann?)  Then again, I might just be reading too much into everything."
Fencing,3b22al,white_light-king,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:33:58 2015 UTC,My uneducated guess why people switch is body shape matching cut of the whites.
Fencing,3b22al,Georgy_K_Zhukov,2,Fri Jun 26 03:07:31 2015 UTC,"Intuitively, that would seem obvious, but I'll offer a counterpoint.  As a business, your goal is to maximize profit. It would seem highly naive to think that these businesses do not look at what their competitors are doing, and trying to find out why they have more sales.  Granted, this takes a lot of resources, and it appears that a lot of these businesses are more or less close to family-run, so they don't go all out, but it should make you wonder nonetheless.  I'm not entirely convinced of the whole matching the cut of the whites thing anyway. Tons of fencers wear completely oversized clothing without giving a second thought to it all.  Rambling on here, but it seems weird, how in NA, at least from what I can see from fencing.net, we have tons of fencers looking out for European brands (ignoring the home brand of Absolute), but in Europe, everyone either goes for Allstar or a home brand. This, on a continent far smaller than the size of the US. You would assume brand awareness in Europe would be far higher, but it does not appear so.

It's a pretty good ""budget"" option for FIE gear, but if I did it over again, I'd go for the Startex right away."

Fencing,3b22al,robotreader,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:04:49 2015 UTC,"I was wondering if I(nor someone else, preferably) should summarize the articles available for easy access. So far I got: an epee blade should be straight from the POV where you see the wires directly and bent 30° viewed from side; tennis shoes are better for your legs, speed decrease up for debate; visconti grip seems to be the ideal in terms of forearm tension."
Fencing,3b22al,sgsand,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:21:44 2015 UTC,"I was quite confused with the blade canting experiments. They don't really tell you which plane the cant is in. Also, I find their methodology somewhat suspect, as they only have a very small group of fencer lunging at a target, as I recall. As such I don't think you can take the conclusions too strongly. That whole 17 degrees thing, seems a little too specific, given that the experiment wasn't very extensive.  I think the only thing you can really take away from them is that canting the blade is probably good... probably.  The shoes thing isn't so much that 'tennis shoes are better for your legs', so much as there are 2 studies out there that look two specific things (tibial shock, and plantar foot pressure), and in both studies the court shoe performed better. Neither found that the court shoe slowed the lunge, I don't know where that came from. Maybe someone skimmed the article and misread this line:   The court shoe tended to alter fencing kinematics, generally though not significantly decreasing the velocity of the front foot and the weapon hand, and increasing the range of motion and overall travel of the weapon hand.    So, for me, the takeaway from these studies is that there is no evidence of injury prevention quality of fencing shoes. That doesn't mean that fencing shoes can't prevent injury, just that there isn't any reason to believe that they are any better than court shoes. Since fencing shoes are general much more expensive, for me, I think the burden of evidence is on them to justify the cost.  There is no evidence of performance one way or the other, though I'm very certain that you'll find that most top fencers use fencing shoes. Whether that convinces you that a) fencing shoes help people fence better in general or b) fencing shoes can particularly help a given individual fence better, is sort of up to you. For me, I find that my comfort in a pair of shoes has more to do with being used to them than anything else, so I made a conscious choice to get used to a cheap pair of court shoes.  Side note though! This year my front toenail has been pulled back twice. I've been wearing these cheap court shoes for about 3 years now, so I didn't recently change to cheap shoes and then hurt my toe, so I ascribe the fact that it happened twice within a few months due to the fact that I probably had scar tissue under my toenail, so it was more likely to happen a second time.  But, I do suspect that the cheap-ass shoes I'm using might not be as robust as they could be in the front toe area. That being said, I'm not sure that a lot of expensive shoes (fencing or otherwise) are any better in this regard. So there's that.  I can't remember the details of the visconti handle thing."
Fencing,3b02vp,Babilos,15,Wed Jun 24 21:58:29 2015 UTC,"I would guess that it's quite common.  That being said, a friend of mine coaches in the states, and I don't want to put words in his mouth, but he says in his club, he says if he gets a fencer who puts the effort in, their rough rule of thumb is to hope for that fencer to improve 1 classification level within 1 year. He also says that they mostly meet this goal.  The hard truth, is that is that with some basic skills, it's actually not hard to lift yourself up from the 'the masses'. It is also my experience, that most coaches don't really teach or focus on these skills.  If you're practicing 3 times a week, and if a decent coach actually pays attention to what your doing, for even an half an hour a week, I would think that you should able to push forward.  Though 30 lessons in 4 years, is probably not enough. That's like 1 lesson every 2 months. It seems like it would be difficult to try to remember what you learned in the last lesson by 2 months later, so it would be hard to build something, but if you have someone watching you to keep you on task while you're practicing it might work.  Some things I might ask myself:    do I know how to recognise the distance from which I can attack I pretty much be sure of scoring? do I have a number of ways of getting into that distance? do i know what I want to be doing/looking for/trying to accomplish, when I am moving forwards? do I know what I want to be doing when my opponent is moving forwards? do I have the mechanical skills to touch someone easily in a number of different places? in ideal situations do I know how to recognise when to attack, counter attack, and riposte?   These are things that after 4 years of trying to get competitive success, you probably should have some answers too."

Fencing,3b02vp,toolofthedevil,11,Wed Jun 24 22:33:01 2015 UTC,"All of this is for foil, but probably applies to the other weapons too.  Really I think it's mostly about recognising distance in realistic terms.  The classical thinking, is that lunge distance is any distance that you can reach with a lunge, but that's not really a useful definition.  On the other hand there is a distance, that if you legitimately go to the target, the defender will not be able to defend. i.e. if both of you stand still at this distance, you should be able to hit with a single movement, either direct or indirect (but not making broken-time, or a lot of feints), and the defender will not be able to successfully parry in time.  Now, you know, if you can create this distance, you should have a good chance of scoring. You also know, that you shouldn't launch actions from outside this distance (well, not legitimate actions anyway).  The other thing that they don't really teach, is how to actually make an attack that goes to the target. if you completely straighten your arm before you lunge, you won't be able to get past the parry. It telegraphs the action too much. A simple action needs to be coordinated. This is hard to explain in words, but I've seen a surprising number of people who can't consistently score against a static opponent unless their close enough to hit with an extension. This seems to be largely because the mechanics of their lunge/attack aren't very good. This is something that can be corrected in just a few weeks of effort I think.  Continuing with the distance theme, a friend of mine was telling me about some students he inherited from another coach. When he was giving them a lesson, he noticed that they had absolutely no concept of riposte distance. He said he would do a 'coaches' attack from way to far away, and the student would make a quarte parry, and instinctually completely extend their arm for riposte, but still be a good 2-3 inches short, because they were way to far away.  To me, this is a basic skill. It seems like the former coach had taught them so that, whenever they catch the blade, they should always just blindly riposte without any regard to how close they were. I think it's a basic skill to be able to recognise riposte distance, and perhaps even correct the placement of the riposte over a small range of distances (I wouldn't teach beginners to do a lot of infighting, but I dunno, I wouldn't keep it from them for long).  I've also seen a lot of fencers who don't know how to recognise a good moment to counter attack. In a lesson situation, if I as the coach pull my arm backwards as I step into extension distance, I pretty much universally expect a student to either stop-hit and get away, or hit and step in with a close, or turn or something.  But it's surprising how many fencers, with a fair amount of experience, only counter attack out of desperation or instinct or something. And in a lesson, when you give them a good moment to make a simple counter attack, just don't know what too do (normally, they just step backwards, following you).  And finally, I think it's important that fencers learn how to comfortably hit different lines.  I've seen a lot of clubs where if you just lean forward a lot, and obscure your chest, a good portion of the fencers just won't ever be able to hit you.  This might mean learning flicking, though that takes a fair deal of hand strength for a beginner. But even if you don't make them flick, I would want my fencers to be able to comfortably recognise the the orientation of their opponent, and the distance, and place the point angulated, on the flank, or just make a better angle with the chest by dropping their hand or something. This goes hand in hand with recognising the distance.  I think if you learn these skills to a basic level (obviously the mechanical stuff can always be improved), you can do quite well in tournaments. When you see a mediocre fencer, just happily marching forward on a beginner, absence of blade, and then happily hitting when the beginner panics, I think this is largely the culmination of these skills, and the lack of these skills in the beginner.  To summarise   Recognise simple attack distance, and make simple attack recognise riposte distance, and make riposte recognise good moments to counter attack be able place your point in different lines and with some angulation   I think you can get quite far with this stuff, maybe some other things too."
Fencing,3b02vp,venuswasaflytrap,2,Wed Jun 24 22:59:51 2015 UTC,Great explanation. You covered in more detail what I was trying to say about having an explosive simple attack.
Fencing,3b02vp,charkins,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:46:19 2015 UTC,"do I know how to recognise the distance from which I can attack I pretty much be sure of scoring?   I'm short, so I know that distance but I also know attacking is usually suicidal. I use more counterattacks into the recovery or attacks after a failed attack has gone past me and the other fencer is very close.   do I have a number of ways of getting into that distance?   No, because my height allows the other fencer to control the distance. I can lure newbies in, but experienced fencers have complete control of the bout since their reach is so much longer.   do i know what I want to be doing/looking for/trying to accomplish, when I am moving forwards?   Yeah, I'm pretty confident in that area. If I were 8 inches taller I could make a lot of things work.   do I know what I want to be doing when my opponent is moving forwards?   As long as they aren't varying the tempo slow to fast I do. Starting slow and then finishing fast gets me every time.   do I have the mechanical skills to touch someone easily in a number of different places?   No. I'm as awkward as a person can be without it being considered a medical disability. I can aim for body, arm, or leg but nothing more specific than that.   in ideal situations do I know how to recognise when to attack, counter attack, and riposte?   Yes. I have to adapt my strategy to my height and physical ability, but I know the theory of fencing forwards and backwards.  Also, now that you mention that idea of one classification per year, I think that is a good rule of thumb for male fencers who compete on a regular basis. I'm thinking about the people I know, and it's basically applied to almost all of the teen/adult male fencers I can think of."
Fencing,3b02vp,justin107d,7,Wed Jun 24 22:52:52 2015 UTC,"but experienced fencers have complete control of the bout since their reach is so much longer.   I see this as a key weakness.  So many people underestimate the importance of footwork.  You should always try to lead the footwork, any weapon, any direction.  Keep them reacting to your movements so you stay one step ahead.  Also since you fence epee, work on the short targets, hand and foot.  They negate their height advantage and set you up for other actions.  Finally, keep working on the basics as none of this matters if you can't remain in control of your body and point."
Fencing,3b02vp,FractalBear,2,Wed Jun 24 23:42:44 2015 UTC,"Leading the footwork after the first couple of touches is something I've never figured out. Once they realize how much of a distance advantage they have, they simply refuse to ever react other than with a counterattack."
Fencing,3b02vp,KingArhturII,2,Thu Jun 25 00:05:51 2015 UTC,"Your blades are the same length. If you're attacking shallow arm and hand targets then it doesn't matter how much taller they are then you. The height difference plays the biggest effect for deep targets.  If they're not respecting your footwork, then you should be able to get in close. And if you know they're going to counter attack then you can set up a counter parry riposte.   Additionally, if you are truly threatening their hand with shallow actions then it will be much harder for them to simply throw out counterattacks without first getting hit by your credible threat.  Last thing to come to mind, second intention is the friend of us short people (5'9"", short for a male epeeist). Credible threat to the hand, draw a reaction, and then bind/disengage lunge/fleche where which option is dependent on what they do. There are many other options, but this is the sort of idea. Height can be overcome. I'd also suggest watching videos of short fencers -- FIE rankings list their heights."
Fencing,3b02vp,justin107d,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:44:13 2015 UTC,"If they counterattack, just finish to the arm."
Fencing,3b02vp,hardwaregeek,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:30:45 2015 UTC,"if that's all they do, draw the arm out, take the blade, and really commit to hitting them.  If you can set it up on their forward step and fleshe at them hard, fast, and at an appropriate distance then you should get touches or atleast doubles.  If you are still a little far add a disengage before or after the parry.  if they are still too far then press them back to the end of the strip so they can't run away anymore.  Find where those distances are for just taking the blade and take the blade and rolling off.  EDIT:  As a tall person who loves fencing even taller people, we are not invincible just because we are tall.  We also tend to be slower than you shorter guys.  Some of the best epee fencers are on the shorter end of the spectrum."
Fencing,3b02vp,justin107d,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:38:06 2015 UTC,"In theory that should work, but taking the blade is something I have a very hard time with. Usually my first parry action is ineffective because the opponent effortlessly disengages, or at most I graze their blade and they just roll right off. I'm not fast enough to do a second parry before they hit me with a counterattack. This confuses me because I find it virtually impossible to disengage during an attack and the opponent always succeeds in taking my blade. Several coaches have been stumped by why this is so hard for me to get, so I really don't know what to say about that."
Fencing,3b02vp,venuswasaflytrap,2,Fri Jun 26 15:35:38 2015 UTC,Have you considered getting a lighter blade? For me at least the difference between a light BF and a heavy BF is enough to throw off my disengages and parries

My knowledge is mostly foil though I suspect a lot of this applies to epee too.   Just from all your talk about height, it seems like you're probably doing a lot of things from out of distance, and not very good at finding ways to come into distance.   You should have ways to bring even taller fencers within your reach on your own terms. I may be that you have to move more than them to accomplish this, but it's completely possible.   I think you need to get more from your coach. It seems like you've got in in your head that you're just not good enough at lunging, or not good enough at point control, or whatever. But these things can be learned, and if you're properly trying 3 times a week to learn these mechanics and not progressing, then you need to address this.   I'm generally really annoyed at the idea that the coaches job is to just tell the fencer to go do 100 lunges and come back. I mean sure, if there is a strength limitation or something, it might be worth saying ""Go get stronger"", cus you don't need a fencing coach for that.  But a person isn't going to improve if their doing the mechanics of the action incorrectly on their own 100 times in a row."
Fencing,3b02vp,hardwaregeek,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:09:38 2015 UTC,"Yes, I'm an epeeist, more by necessity than by choice since there's no foil worth mentioning anywhere near me and I have no interest in sabre.  Usually the way bouts go is that I get the first 2 or 3 touches because my opponent is being cautious and doing a lot of preparatory/fancy actions. Then they catch on that they have a 3 to 6 inch reach advantage on me and they just start doing explosive attacks the moment I get in their distance (and before I can do anything to get into my proper attacking distance). My coach is good and doesn't send me away to mindlessly practice stuff with no supervision. I do wish I could practice more things with other fencers, but they're all very advanced and the way a practice usually goes is that everyone fences everyone else to 15, rivals fence a couple of extra bouts against each other and then everyone goes home."

It doesn't matter how good your technique is if you can't execute it because of nerves. Find your weaknesses and learn to counteract them. If you're short learn good footwork and beats, if you're slow learn distance and train your reflexes.   I have been fencing for a lot longer than you, but I never took it seriously until three years ago. Even then, with probably more lessons in a year than what you've taken in four, it took me a year to get an E. And after getting my D, it took nearly a year for my C.

I have taken more lessons recently and my form has improved, but my tournament finishing position hasn't.

Lessons are important if you want to improve: take one, then go bout and try to do what you learnt. Losing is fine, as long as you put it into practice. Have a journal too, so you write down these things and log how you feel about stuff. You'll be forced to sit down and review what you've worked on, what works, and what doesn't.

Fencing,3b02vp,charkins,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:52:51 2015 UTC,Mostly depends where you are and the density of weapon ratings in your area. Can also depends on your division/region and how frequently you attend rates events.

We have a lot of really good epeeist who can give you advice on things to work with your maître.  Anyway, don't despair, fencing is a mental sport as well, and if you get nervous and lose your calm, anything you learn will be useless. Remember to fence one point at a time, and to have fun!"
Fencing,3b02vp,K_S_ON,2,Thu Jun 25 00:54:02 2015 UTC,I think after 4 years I'm beyond the point of needing advice. I know all the tactics but I can't apply all of them at will. Mainly I just wanted to get an idea of how many other people of my involvement were still Us after 4 years. I haven't found anyone else who had fenced competitively for 4 years and doesn't have a rating except for a few women who only fence in mixed events. And to be honest I'm not willing to humiliate myself by showing my fencing to the world.

Fencing,3b02vp,battlecow,1 point,Thu Jun 25 06:47:01 2015 UTC,"That's true. What I probably should have said is that I feel like I'm in need of something other than tactical advice at this point. I don't know what, but I don't feel like I could mentally incorporate any more tactical advice than what I've already been given by various coaches."
Fencing,3b02vp,battlecow,2,Thu Jun 25 22:48:33 2015 UTC,"My experience is that every coach, and every fencer you talk to will have a lot of different things to focus on. If you try to do them all you'll get pulled in every direction and not get anywhere.  The amount of time/effort you're putting into this seems to me that you should be able to improve past unrated. I really think you need to talk to your coach and form some sort of plan.  I haven't seen you fence, and I'm not an epeeist anyway, but I really think there is a disconnect between your effort and your performance. That indicates to me that there is a problem in what you're doing somewhere.  Maybe your coach is a bad coach. Maybe he's a great coach, but doesn't realise that you want to be competitively stronger, and has just been letting you 'do your thing'. Maybe he's a great coach, but is focusing on other fencers at your club. Maybe he's a great coach, but is having gender identity issues so hasn't been able to give you the needed attention. Maybe the payment structure is that if you start taking more lessons from him, you'll get more attention.  Regardless I think, given the amount of effort you seem to be willing to invest, it's worth it for you to sit down a figure out where you want to go and what you want to do.   If the best fencers in your club are mediocre at best, it could be that your coach is just not good at producing competitive results - which is fine. Fencing is not all about winning tournaments, and I think there is a lot of value in creating community - but if you want tournament results, then that might not be the coach for you.  If your coach does have a cadre of strong fencers, then you can talk to him about what you need to do to get there.  But one way or another, I think you need to sort out your training if you hope to make different results than you have been.  Not everyone can be world champion, it's true. But everyone has enough innate potential to be a fairly decent fencer I think. I'm 100% sure that 3 times a week of legitimate effort should be able to put you past unrated, unless you have some sort of severe medical limitation that you haven't mentioned (missing a foot or something?)"
Fencing,3b02vp,twoslow,1 point,Fri Jun 26 09:48:26 2015 UTC,"I think the coach is good and trains people well. The club has produced several good fencers, but I do feel that most of them have either come in as adults with natural skill, or else they made major improvements just through the natural process of growing and maturing. Basically the coach took them from good to great, not from zero to good. One of them (a veteran) went from zero to a C rating even though he usually only fences once a month or less. This is not to discount the value of lessons and practice, but more to say that my club seems to self-select for the naturally gifted more than the ones who come in with no skills and no talents, and then become good fencers through years of weekly lessons.  I do have both feet, though some would say I have two left feet. I washed out of other sports in the past due to extreme awkwardness and slow reactions. Even as a kid when I would try to run it was a comical flailing of arms and legs that always left me not only in last place, but often a huge distance behind everyone else. So there's still a chance that I have some sort of undiagnosed problem, but I don't know anyone who can diagnose that. There are tests for people who are too awkward to function, but apparently not for people who can survive daily life but can't make it in athletics."

Also, quite a lot of fellows know their shit and provide solid advice. I remember /u/TheFencingCoach was offering in one of the Friday Megathreads to receive videos of people from the subreddit fencing, so he could give some input.  Also, I don't understand why showing a video here would be more embarrasing that fencing in an actual competition...

Fencing,3ayzin,venuswasaflytrap,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:49:17 2015 UTC,"Well, it's slightly harder to interpret than that due to an increasing fencing base.   A= I have no idea how it is determined (might edit this post after I check it up), but it's equivalent to the top 1 to 4 (or sometimes, no one meets the criteria?) B= Top 8% C= Top 19.04% D=Top 35.242%   This is all rounded up after you have multiplied it by the number of fencers.  Anyways, this is very different from the US (outdated data): http://www.fencing.net/forums/thread19272-post310058.html#post310058  PS. The current Canadian system only came out in the 2006-2007 season.  Old system:  THE POINT SYSTEM   The points earned by a fencer in any one tournament shall be the sum of (a) Participation Points -- the maximum number of points to be awarded shall be equal to the total number of competitors, and shall be awarded to the winner of the event. Second place shall receive one point less and so on to the last place competitor who shall receive one point. Fencers who are equal shall receive the same points, i.e. 20 competitors -- 2 fencers equal for 18th place will receive 3 points each. The 20th place will receive 1 point. (b) Quality Points -- points are awarded in the tournament for each participating A, B, or C Class fencer, with 20 points given for each A Class, 10 for each B, and 5 for each C Class fencer. These points are only awarded to the X first placed fencers of the tournament, X being the total number of classified fencers entered. For example, if 9 classified fencers are entered (3 ""A"", 2 ""B"", and 4 ""C""), then quality points will be awarded to the top nine fencers only. Quality points add one to the other from the last placing which is entitled to them up to the first place and in the order C, then B, then A. (c) Bonus Points -- for top three -- 15 additional points shall be awarded to the tournament winner, 10 points to the second place fencer and 5 points to the third and fourth place fencers. (d) All foreign fencers will be classified retroactively in the competition. That is, they will earn a classification according to their result in the competition and these newly earned classifications will contribute to the quality points of the competition. The old classification system was different too.   As a final side note, nobody cares about their domestic ranking in Canada."
Fencing,3ayzin,UselessFencingFacts,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:56:31 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that Canadian Letter classification system is more an ad-hoc system so that Canadian fencers can be seeded in US tournaments. Canadian tournaments are seeded by domestic rank, and of course the international slots are determined by the weird selection ranking (and whatever black magic happens to be going on that year), so domestically Letter Classifications aren't used for anything.  Why do you prefer the US system to the Domestic Ranking?"
Fencing,3ayzin,venuswasaflytrap,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:30:35 2015 UTC,"In the U.S. system, if you do well, once, at the right tournament you keep that classification for 4 years.  I think its good that there is benefit for people who go to more tournaments. That's what we want, isn't it?  Otherwise, there is less incentive for the strong fencers to go to more tournaments once they earned their ranking/seed.   Of course, the fact that Canada has multiple ranking systems kinda undermines that. If you look at men's foil, a lot of those guys are fencing more than 5 tournaments. They're just not fencing the domestic events. And that's why you get things like Brodeur being ranked number one, when, by my money (and probably his too), there are a handful of guys that would definitely be ahead of him.  I guess I just don't like the idea that you can swoop in for 1 lucky tournament in 4 years, and I'm quite happy with the idea that more tournaments (up to a 5ish) means better rank. If you want results, you have to play!"
Fencing,3ayzin,venuswasaflytrap,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:26:33 2015 UTC,"What would you think, as a thought experiment, of factoring in how often you earn a rating?  So someone who gets lucky and gets an A is a A1.  Someone who has earned his A three times is a A3.  After every season, you lose a number, and if it goes down to 0 you go down a level."
Fencing,3ayzin,robotreader,2,Thu Jun 25 16:45:31 2015 UTC,"Classification as a concept is fundamentally different than rankings.  The goal of classification is to attempt to qualify the skill levels of fencers. Ranking is an attempt to represent the results of all the fencers at a particular point.  So, if someone tears up the league 5 years in a row in 2000-2005 and wins every single event, your system might give them an A20. If they don't compete for 10 years, and enter an event in 2015, it's probably not unrealistic to have them still at 'A' level, since they won every tournament for 5 years (or whatever). They likely haven't gotten much worse, despite aching (and even then, I don't feel so bad about an aged competitor who was really good, being still considered 'A').  But that's not the point of ranking systems. A ranking system would say, ""yeah you were and probably are still very good, but every year is a new game, why should you get credit for games 10 years ago"".  There are kids who weren't fencing in 2005, who are now very good. It seems weird to have a system that puts someone ahead of them when they never even competed in the same time period.  Every year is a new year to me.   I once won a regional tournament, but felt bad because I felt like ""I [x person] showed up, then I wouldn't have won"". Someone pointed out, ""you can only beat the people who are there"". The world champion (or world top ranked) is the best in the world. It doesn't matter if someone won world championships more times, or more convincingly before - this year the world champion is the best. Second place is the second best and so on.  To me, a B2015 says more than an A2012. Why should B2015 be below than A2012? The B may never have had a chance to compete in the same field as the A. It could have been an easier year. Or a harder year. There's no comparison.   I think the idea of ranking, I.e. ""Right now, this is how people would be ranked"", makes way more sense."
Fencing,3ayzin,venuswasaflytrap,8,Thu Jun 25 17:15:59 2015 UTC,Virtually every other country just has a national ranking.
Fencing,3ayzin,venuswasaflytrap,2,Fri Jun 26 02:24:15 2015 UTC,That's so cool - so you know exactly where you match up nationally? 1345th? Etc?
Fencing,3ayzin,BeardedFencer,6,Fri Jun 26 07:16:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I think it's a way better system, and I think it's only trivially more difficult, if not possibly easier, to implement than the US Class system.  Every tournament is assigned a point strength from some formula. It doesn't really matter specifically what the formula is, but it should take into account the strength of the fencers in the tournament (as determined by their national rank), and the number of fencers.  Then, the fencers in the tournament earn points depending on their result. The specifics of formula for this don't matter too much either, but it's should be fairly geometric, not linear - e.g. maybe first place is worth twice as much as second, second place is worth twice as much as third etc. Often you see things so that there are larger jumps in points at every round, like 31st might earn 10 more points than 32, but 32 earns 50 more points than 33rd due to the fact that they're in the top 32.  Then fencers are ranked nationally by how many points they have. Normally your total points must be from your best n tournaments (maybe 5-6). This way you don't get a situation where someone has gone to 500 dinky tournaments, and out ranks someone who wins a massive tournament. But it also encourages people to go to multiple tournaments. Generally you would make the points from any given tournament expire in a year.  Advantages:   It provides an actual national ranking. The Letter Classification system primarily functions as a seeding tool. A national ranking can be thought of as the end goal of a competition. Finishing higher than someone on the national rank, is akin to finishing ahead of them in a tournament. It doesn't mean that you are better than them necessarily, it means that, in that year you performed better than them for whatever reasons. It provides higher resolution seeding. You can confidently seed 495th ahead of 496th in a tournament. Instead of thinking of it as a reflection of the ability of the fencer, you can think of it as 'winning the spot'. By the rules of the national ranking the 495th guy earned the right to be seeded higher than the 496th guy. There can be ties, but they will be much much more infrequent. It reflects current performance. If someone won all the tournaments 2 years ago, and then gained 30 kg, then they are not the same fencer as they were 2 years ago. The thing is, no one is the same fencer they were 2 years ago. Everyone is only as good as their last tournament. This reflects that. As a side effect of that, historical results are better collated. You can look over the yearly national rankings and see a history of performance for any given fencer. You can see the 3 years when Billy dominated, and the year he took off to become amish, and then when he came back. Also you don't have to keep track of years of data. In the US right now, if a guy wins a tournament, earns an A, and then immediately disappears from the face of the earth, he will be on the records as an A for 4 years, then a B for 4 years and so on. You have keep track of his rating for 20 years. That seems crazy to me. In a yearly domestic ranking system, only the people who competed this year are kept track of, because they are the only people to participate in this season. It's not difficult to add seedings from other leagues. You can say ""2015 FIE points are worth 50 points each for the 2015 season"". So then if fencers are fencing inter-league, you can seed them (if you choose).   The UK, a country with 1/5th the population of the US, but probably more fencers per captia, can keep track of their ranking, by volunteers, in a single excel file per weapon, so it's not a massive undertaking. You don't have to keep track of all the fencers, so much as all the results of the registered competitions in the season (which presumably you have to do anyway). And even if it is too much for the US, I don't see why the divisions couldn't keep their own rankings."

I'll have a great seeding as Summer Nationals! Uh, but not if I go fence and lose it. So I stay home. Yay?  Any system where you can lose points could encourage this kind of ratings hoarding. And, like in chess, we'll have to worry about people tanking bouts to fit in under some Div II barrier. If you have to be under 1800 to fence in Div II, and I'm an 1850, hey, maybe I'll go fence in a few events left-handed, that might be fun. I go, lose, drop under 1800 and I can fence Div II. Yay?  As much as people hate it, the current system never rewards losing. We never have people tanking bouts to drop down to Div II, we never have people stay home to 'save' a rating.

Is there some reason to think that a uniform national ranking (in the US, with our huge number of fencers) would do a measurably better job?  If not, as much as people bitch about it, the current system has some nice properties. It's a high water mark, so if you desperately want your C or something you can just go fence a lot; every time you fence, you have a shot at a C. AND THERE'S NEVER A PENALTY FOR FENCING. I think that's a rather large good characteristic. If you can lose ranking by fencing, you will sometimes (perhaps often) have an incentive not to fence.  And the current system works pretty well with US Fencing's Div II/III structure, which has been very beneficial to sub-elite fencing in the US.   Anyway, I think a unified national ranking is probably better than many of the Elo variants I've heard of, but you still need to keep in mind what you're gaining and what you might lose. If all you get is slightly better seeding, what's the point?"
Fencing,3ayzin,K_S_ON,2,Fri Jun 26 06:45:46 2015 UTC,"A ranking system is conceptually different than just a seeding system. It actually represents the current results.   You could make an an argument that in a given tournament, there isn't necessarily a large difference between 20th and 30th place. They're both round of 32, they probably didn't do that different in pools. The 20th place result is actually not super indicative of anything major. You could say the same with say 2nd and (the other) 3rd place. If they didn't fence each other, they've both made it more or less the same distance in the competition, and lost to the same guy. Hell it could be that 2nd did worse in pools, and got lucky to not run into the eventual winner until the final.  So you could do away with ranking the tournament, and just paint in broad strokes. Why bother even fencing off the finals - top 8 all get A's. They made it.  But that's the point, of course. The whole point of going to a tournament is to determine the results. We do this so that we can be ranked.  So if both are roughly equal to implement, and both are roughly as useful for seeding, I much prefer to have league level results."
Fencing,3ayzin,venuswasaflytrap,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:25:43 2015 UTC,"This is a very interesting point, and is probably the best justification for a unified national ranking list that I've seen: you just want to be ranked, in the same way one might want to know where one ended up in a competition.  But it gets a little muddy if you're going to use this ranking system for seeding. In that case, regardless of what you were thinking when you instituted it, it takes on all the virtues and vices of a seeding system in which one can gain or lose places by fencing.  So I think your last paragraph is important; are they both roughly equal to implement? Are they roughly as useful for seeding?   There's a temptation when one has an old system like the US high water mark rating system to only see what one does not like in the current system, and not consider fully any failure points in any proposed new system. For example, I know some moderately serious chess players. They're very familiar with Elo rankings. Elo rankings and their effects on chess play are a much-discussed item in the chess world, but I never hear proponents of numerical ratings (or rankings that will be used for seeding) address any of these problems. What about sandbagging? What about top players playing for draws? That happens a lot in chess, but in fencing the only way to play for a draw is for the top A's in the region to just stay home.  People who understand Elo pretty well describe it as measuring the height of a cork in a bobbing pool with a ruler held by a shaky hand; it's precise but only accurate in the long term. Chess has a huge problem with people thinking momentary Elo ratings are exact measurements of how good someone is.   Fencing is far more variable than chess. So our pool bobs a lot more than the chess pool does, our corks are moving wildly way up and down. But a numerical rating will still give a very precise number to this inherently unstable thing. Is false precision like this really a goal?  ETA: wording"
Fencing,3ayzin,K_S_ON,2,Fri Jun 26 05:42:26 2015 UTC,"It's only false precision if you think of what it represents as an indication of skill. But if you think of it as an earned result, then it's no more false precision than ranking after the pools is false precision.  The ranking, is the ranking that every fencer earned. The seeding is part of the reward for achieving the ranking.  The reality is, that it's impossible to seed everyone according to skill.   I mean, if we really wanted to try to do that, it would involve some sort of statistics that recognizes that everyone normally lies on a belle curve. You would need to figure out a metric for skill and figure out the average level of a tournament entrant, and you would use every result they have as a data-point. Unknown entrants should be seeded higher than an entrant who finishes consistently below the average skill indicator. Every competitor would have an estimated skill indicator, and a calculated margin of error depending on how many data points was available. They also would have have projected skill plots, so if a fencer was on a path of improvement, they should really be seeded higher at the next tournament. If they were on a path of degradation, they be seeded lower, once again with consideration to the number of data points. Results of fencers who finished significantly outside of their estimated normal range should be discarded as outliers.  But even if the complications of implementing this we're prohibitive, I don't think we'd really want to do that anyway. Competition's aren't about judging people by estimated values. It's about giving everyone a chance to win. Someone performing beyond their expected skill is applauded, not treated as an anomaly. We ignore the concept of actual skill completely. We're only concerned with who's performed better.  If you win a tournament, and I get 5th, it's not right for me to say ""But, I'm actually more skilled than you"". All that matters is that, in that tournament you found a way to win, and I didn't. Same goes if you're seeded first in national rankings and I'm seeded fifth.  So there isn't any false precision. The person who is number one, is the person who performed the best according to the rules of the system. Same with number 245 or 1035."
Fencing,3ayzin,venuswasaflytrap,1 point,Fri Jun 26 07:40:51 2015 UTC,"I agree with all this, completely.  But are you going to use this ranking for seeding? If not, carry on, and I think such a list could be very interesting. In fact, I think Peet could construct such a list right now from askfred data, and I think that would be so interesting! Just take the Canadian system and apply it to US data, and presto! We have a national list. Cool!   But if you are going to use it for seeding, it doesn't matter that you're thinking of it as a ranking system when you put it in place. It will act as a seeding system, and people will treat it as a seeding system and make rational decisions based on the rules in place to get the best seeding they can.  In public policy decisions like this, it doesn't matter what you're thinking when you make the rule. What matters is the actual effect of the rule, under actual (assumed to be rational) gameplay."
Fencing,3ayzin,K_S_ON,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:45:48 2015 UTC,"Seeding is the reward for results in the (national ranking) game. It's not public policy, so much as rules of the game. We want them to try to get the best seeding that they can.  Just like when you get seeded into the DE out of pools, it's not really intended to reflect the potential skill, it's part of the competition. Yes it's hypothetically possible to game it, but except in extreme situations, like very small/predictable tournaments, or in cases where you know you can beat everyone else, fencers are almost always incentivised to get the top seeding that they can, because the higher the seed that you get, the easier your opponents will be.  National points, if the parameters are set reasonably, generally inventivise people to:   enter lots of tournaments, up to the capped amount (5-6 normally) and a little beyond (in case they do bad in some of them) enter specially designated events, because they are either added as extras beyond normal tournaments (the Canadian system counts your best 5 events + regionals + nationals), or are designated special points (British nationals is worth 1.5 the points of any other tournament). enter events that they can win, because a first place at a small tournament is worth disproportionately more points, so winning a small tournament can be comparable to top 32 at a big tournament. It should be balanced so that no matter what tournament you go to, if you perform well, you get rewarded well. The only exception is if you are so much better than everyone else, that even a bad performance is first place - in which case you will get relatively fewer points than you're used to, because it's a weaker tournament than you're used too. It can even be good for beginners, because getting bottom 10 in a huge tournament might be worth 3 points, while 2nd last at a small tournament might be worth 2 (in the Canadian system, if you get dead last, you still get one point, which I think is good, since showing up is better than nothing. The British system only awards points to top x%, which i think is bad).   It basically encourages people to fence. Which is good! It can still cause regions of low points, but really, that's just cus there aren't a lot of strong fencers around there. If there were, one or two of them could go to some big events, earn some points, and then any local event they entered would be worth more.  What doesn't happen is persistent regions of easy ratings. Yeah one year, someone might get lucky and get lots of points at a big tournament, and then bring some of those points back to their local events, which get spread around because they don't win the local events. But that can't last very long, because the average national ranking of that area would drop when the points from the big event expire, so the local tournaments wouldn't be worth much anymore.  In the case of ratings, if group of people earn some As, and then come back to a local event, and lose - then someone else earns a fresh A. And then if that person loses, another person earns a fresh A, etc. And that region can have easy ratings for years afterwards.  The only way a region can have easy points is if they have a lot of people going to a lot of tournaments, and even then you can't really inflate the point all that much without big results. And the small amount that you can inflate the points - well it's good! If the region has lots of people competing it should be better!  The class system is a holdover from the older system where people earn prevost, apprentice, master, or whatever. They didn't have a centralised computer hub to keep track of everyone so it was easier just to have  a few examinations occasionally to qualify fencers. Then if a fencer shows up at your door, they could say ""I'm a prevost"", and you could either just trust them, or contact someone who knew to verify it. That progressed to a A, B, C system, and only when people started caring about actual results did they realise that fencers actually got worse sometimes (like by age), so they added the degrading thing.  But really that ""I earned my belt"" thinking is at the crux of the high water mark system. But it's obsolete now. Fencing has moved on - it's no longer an art form that you're examined on, and earn permanent qualifications for. And technology has moved on - we're now able to keep a track of every tournament result in a national league on a rolling basis."

Fencing,3ayzin,toolofthedevil,3,Fri Jun 26 17:30:34 2015 UTC,Because being tied for 160th with 100 other fencers is probably more worthless than the letter system.
Fencing,3ayzin,Switchsquatch,7,Fri Jun 26 18:47:05 2015 UTC,"In the last Division I Men's Epee NAC there were 48 A14s without any national points. That's a reality. So assuming the gradation of points awarded for a national ranking was really so bad that there were 100 fencers that were tied for 160th half of them would all have to be at the same tournament at the same time to be worse than what we have now.   Let's look at a regional tournament. I'll use our Div I-A ROC: The Battle in Seattle. 14 A14s in the event. That's more than 15% of the tournament being seeded around completely randomly. So, 16 of those 100 ties would have to all be at the same regional tournament to be worse than what we have happening right now.  And obviously, I disagree with the premise that there would be that many ties anyways."

Fencing,3ayzin,K_S_ON,2,Wed Jun 24 20:43:20 2015 UTC,"Hungary just uses a national ranking list, similar to the FIE rankings.  Generally speaking, the bigger the tournament, the bigger the points.  There is also the new concept of recreational/Category B fencing, where you don't need to be up to all licensing snuff (IIRC - you don't need to have annual medical clearance, but have to sign a waiver, but it's been very long).  Rankings are broken down by age group (seniors, junior, cadets, etc.)  I can't pull up the scoring grid (I'm at work, and while reddit is not blocked, sports-related pages are) - IIRC it's 32 points for the win, 24 for second place, 16 for third (no split bout for the bronze), 8 for top 8, 4 for top 16, 2 for top 32, and one for 64.  Some of the bigger competitions will be designated as doubles; national championship is x4 (I think), World Cup events are x8, GPs x16, European/World Championships/Olympics are x32.  The top ~16 fencers are usually invited to train with the national team twice a week; any actual travel teams are selected from there, with priority going to highest ranked, but the coaches have some say as well."
Fencing,3ayzin,ArcherofArchet,2,Wed Jun 24 22:21:38 2015 UTC,"In the Netherlands, we use a point-based system. The way it works is complicated, but the short version of it is roughly this:  Tournaments are weighted with a percentage. This percentage is calculated through three functions, and takes into consideration the number of participants, the nationalities of those participants, the number of world ranked participants (1 or more points on the FIE list) the number of total world rankers, and the formula of the competetion. It's possible for a tournament to be weighted higher than 100% (Typically world level events are this).   There's a list that show how many points each participant would receive on a tournament weighted at 100%, where the winner gets 1000 points, number two gets 850 or so, and so on.   Your point total is made up of your five highest scoring results.  The national ranking is then used to seed competitions and determine who gets to participate in world and zonal championships, as well as in world cups.   For world cups, the limit is 1000 points, whereas for zonal and world championships the limit is 2500 points.   A normal Dutch competition is usually weighted around 15-25%. I don't know the weight of a world cup, but since the Dutch number 1, Bas Verwijlen, had over 6000 points on the ranking despite the fact that only 5 tournaments count, they must be at least 200% or 300%, if not more."

In the past, French wires had a single layer of fabric insulation, while a German wire had both enamel and fabric coating to protect them. Your mileage may vary with Chinese-made French or German wires.   If you have an assembled wire and cup, the cup sizes are different, as the internal diameter of the French and German barrels can be different.   Make sure you get the right barrel/cup combination, as if you get the smaller cup with the bigger barrel, the cup will fall too far down in the barrel, and the spring won't fit.  Why not use a simply use an LP tip with an LP blade? They sell relatively inexpensive complete rewire kits, and that takes all the guesswork out of wire/cup/barrel/tip combos."

A few hard hits into an area that was already dented from a bell guard clash put a hole in my guard.  I will still buy them though, as with maintenance they can maintain a pretty normal shape.  Definitely not something to put on a club weapon."

Fencing,3ajq2e,Babilos,5,Sat Jun 20 21:36:39 2015 UTC,"I was in the same boat as you, I qualified for Div 2 and 3 but decided not to go because of my inexperience. I've been fencing for 2 years and usually come somewhere in the top half in tournaments. I'm wondering the same thing as you, I don't know if I made a terrible mistake by deciding not to go or not. I live far away and I had a hard time justifying the cost with my experience. Similar to you, I qualified from a loophole that is supposedly being closed. Is there usually a huge skill gap? Did I make a huge mistake in not going?"
Fencing,3ajq2e,EchoMyGecko,4,Sat Jun 20 22:05:12 2015 UTC,"National events are typically harder than local events.   Also they are a LOT more expensive to go to.  However, going to different competitions is a good thing, regardless of skill level.  A ROC will show you things local events won't, a NAC will show you things big regional events won't.  Nationals will be like a NAC but bigger.  The secret to ""getting your money's worth"" at big events is to watch all the fencing you can and try and learn stuff.  Don't get caught up in measuring where you are vs the field, think about how the stronger fencers are fencing and what you could do to fence more like them.  If I were your coach, I'd drag you to an ROC or some other tournament you can drive several hours to.   You sound like you need a change of scenery from local tournaments, but nationals might be a waste of money."
Fencing,3ajq2e,white_light-king,4,Sun Jun 21 22:43:14 2015 UTC,Look at it this way. How did you do at the qualifier tournament? Compare yourself only to those that qualified. How did you do relative to the 4 or 5 that qualified in that event? Those are the level of people you will be competing against.
Fencing,3ajq2e,stratagizer,5,Sat Jun 20 22:33:08 2015 UTC,"I respectfully disagree. As someone who came out of the Central Florida division originally, I won my division qualifiers with ease. You want to know what the definition of eye-opening is? Squaring off against New York fencers in your pool and realizing that Florida didn't get you so ready at all. Qualifiers don't provide much barometer for success. Going to national tournaments and getting your butt kicked (and understanding why you got your butt kicked) does."
Fencing,3ajq2e,TheFencingCoach,3,Sun Jun 21 21:45:52 2015 UTC,Good point. I didn't fence in the qualifier because of the loophole I mentioned previously. That being that fencing in a Div 2 ROC with 32 or fewer people was an automatic qualification route for Div 3. That's how I got in. I've never even been close to finishing high enough in a qualifier to actually qualify that way. When I look at it in those terms I feel a bit better about my decision since of the people who were actually planning and trying to go to nationals I was near the bottom of the pack.
Fencing,3ajq2e,shaybah,2,Sat Jun 20 22:45:12 2015 UTC,"It would be a good experience, but the only time I would go without feeling prepared is if I don't have to travel far and have extra cash, because yeah, it's a different level. Your endurance has to hold up for longer and your mental game will screw you harder and faster if you lose it."
Fencing,3ajq2e,white_light-king,4,Sun Jun 21 03:07:25 2015 UTC,Your endurance has to hold up for longer   All tournaments are the same length if you lose the first DE.
Fencing,3ajq2e,shaybah,2,Sun Jun 21 22:44:29 2015 UTC,Good point lol. Actually Nationals would be shorter because it's not 100% advance.
Fencing,3ajq2e,hardwaregeek,2,Mon Jun 22 01:28:11 2015 UTC,"Honestly it really depends. If you have the money and the time, going to nationals is a great learning experience. My first NAC definitely gave me that push to become a better fencer. However, I wouldn't suggest going if you aren't comfortable competing on a local/regional level. National tournaments can be intimidating, especially if you don't know anyone there. You want to be comfortable in the ups and downs of a fencing tournament, as well as the various rules and regulations. If I may ask, can you fence Junior or Cadet events? Or are you limited to Senior events?"
Fencing,3ajq2e,white_light-king,1 point,Sun Jun 21 05:09:48 2015 UTC,"I'm in the senior division. I'm comfortable with the tournament process and have fenced in a lot of tournaments. I just never do very well which is why I decided to drop out of nationals. I'm not lacking any motivation either so I don't need a big event to inspire me. Part of me would have liked to go just for the experience, but another part of me knows that I only got in through a loophole and that I could never have qualified under the new rules, so I probably would end up close to last even in Div 3."
Fencing,3ajq2e,hardwaregeek,4,Sun Jun 21 06:14:49 2015 UTC,Part of me would have liked to go just for the experience   You can get the same experience (sitting around in a cavernous room of beeping scoring machines) at a ROC a lot cheaper.

Fencing,3aeigr,Jabra,3,Fri Jun 19 14:36:56 2015 UTC,"Do you mean fleche? How are you defending against it currently? It might be a blade issue, maybe timing, maybe distance."
Fencing,3aeigr,zifnabxar,2,Fri Jun 19 14:04:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, whoops. I did mean flèche. The way I defend now is by extending my arm and advancing, as I use a French grip and everyone here uses Orthopedic. Again, I can only stop the about half the time. The way I get hit is either a double or I miss my extension."
Fencing,3aeigr,WildZontar,6,Fri Jun 19 17:13:47 2015 UTC,"If you're using a french grip, you have a reach advantage. You shouldn't be stepping into someone's attack unless your intent is to hit them early, since otherwise you're throwing that advantage away.  What you need to do is learn how to recognize the situations in which your opponent wants to fleche (namely distance) as well as try to pick up on any tells they have in terms of footwork patterns, blade positioning, or tensing up. Then, when you notice a few of these warning flags position your tip somewhere that if they throw out a fleche, they'll just run into it OR pull distance so that if they start, you're far enough away that you have time to take a step or two back and use your additional reach to hit them before they have had time to fully close the distance.  Stepping in against a fleche usually requires quick blade work to close out your opponent which is rather difficult using a french grip, so I wouldn't recommend it without a LOT of practice and even then you'll want to mix up your responses. If they know you want to step in they'll just take your blade and there's very little you can do about it if they succeed."
Fencing,3aeigr,Darth_Dread,4,Fri Jun 19 19:22:35 2015 UTC,I'm thinking flashing might be a good defense against the fleche.
Fencing,3aeigr,TheFencingCoach,6,Fri Jun 19 15:42:36 2015 UTC,"Can confirm: have often used this technique with students. Surprisingly, I lose their business soon after."
Fencing,3aeigr,K_S_ON,2,Fri Jun 19 22:31:37 2015 UTC,"""Fleche"" isn't really a complete description of the action, though. Are they beating or taking the blade? When are they making a fleche, are you standing still? Is it a takeover on your action falling short? Can you do something to trigger the fleche?  You say that you're a french grip fencer, so here's my generic fg advice: french grip should be unpredictable and disruptive. So practice a step back parry riposte, a step forward opposition counter, a counter to the arm without taking the blade, duck and counter, step back beat counter, attack into the prep of the fleche.  Two ideas which may be useful: your opponent shouldn't know what you're going to do, and if you're counterattacking don't let the hit happen when your opponent wants it to happen; either hit happens sooner than he wants (you step in) or later (you step back). Frustrate him, don't let him have the actions he likes. If he wants to beat, hide the blade. If he wants to fleche, read it and hit him as he starts, or take a big retreat and parry. If he wants to parry, change targets a lot and when he tries to parry, disengage or remise.   Control the distance, control the tempo, make him react to you, be unpredictable and disruptive.   Here, have some videos of Milanoli, Jung, Riboud, and Mazzoni for general french grip inspiration. Good luck!"
Fencing,3aeigr,dsclinef,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:26:41 2015 UTC,"Now if you are talking about defending against a flesche, distance is your friend. But then, distance should always be your friend. You also need to be doing something to disrupt your opponent so that it is harder to set up the flesche.  I would definitely pull out a black card for someone flashing on strip."

Fencing,3af3ck,KatonRyu,6,Sun Jun 21 13:39:08 2015 UTC,"Most commenters on here are current competitive fencers and we take a dim view of nearly all fencing books (with the exception of Epee 2.0) because they aren't based on the experience of going to fencing tournaments and winning.  Nick Evangelista in particular has a reputation for not being able to achieve tournament results that would validate his writings.  The recommendations linked are skewed towards ""classical fencing"" which is viewed by a lot of us as stagnant and shallow because ""classicals"" overwhelmingly get beaten badly at regular fencing events, and don't run their own events.  To learn tournament winning fencing technique is very difficult by any means except regular practice against opponents with quality tournament experience.  Book learning is more often harmful than beneficial."

Fencing,3a8szw,K_S_ON,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:46:18 2015 UTC,"This might be a stupid question, but how do you just ask someone to start fencing? Most of the kids who I fenced in high school with have moved on so I don't think I'll know anybody.    Are you asking about approaching a coach? Just go in, say hi, tell them where you fenced and ask about rates and lessons and times and stuff, look around the club and see if it looks like a place you'd like to fence.  You're interviewing a club, in the same way you'd pick a gym to go do zumba or something. Find a place you can afford and that looks like fun.  Does that answer your question? I'm not sure what you mean by ""ask someone to start fencing"".   Also, should I focus on small unrated tournaments with maybe 6 or 7 fencers where only one person gets an E or should I do the big tournaments? Thanks for answering my questions I really do appreciate it.    Focus on going to practice and taking some lessons for a while, fence at open fencing at your club, and talk to your new coach about what a good competition schedule would be.  Are you still near your old high school? Did you like your high school coach? Maybe you could talk to him/her about a new club."

Fencing,3a7oc6,leftyepee,3,Thu Jun 18 16:45:59 2015 UTC,"Well, shit. I use LP blades exclusively since I break BF's like twigs and find them to be horribly inconsistent in flexibility.

Afterward, it might cut someone, but then so could a BF and it's not like you'd miss a break like this in your weapon so accidentally continuing to use it is out of the question.   Even with this picture, I see absolutely no logical reason for this ban other than to be a dick."

Fencing,3a7oc6,joergisgodly,2,Thu Jun 18 01:21:05 2015 UTC,Banning bayonet cords is a pretty huge deal. I wonder if this'll ever effect us here in the States.
Fencing,3a7oc6,Rythoka,2,Thu Jun 18 14:14:12 2015 UTC,"The ban on bayonet sockets is ridiculous. I've only ever used bayonet sockets since I started fencing in the UK in the early 1990s, and also when I picked it up again about 5 years ago. While there's more potential for the LP-style bayonet socket to go wrong (as it's a slightly more complicated design) they're engineered really well. I've had more problems with the wire breaking inside the bodycord than I have either end of the wire.  As to their statement that:   Equipment that does not work perfectly in all situations and therefore does not comply with FIE Rules (body wire with bayonet connection),   I've seen countless two-prong sockets fail, and our club has seen several people switching from two-prong to LP-style bayonet as a result. I've personally watched multiple fencers at our club unpack a brand-new 2-prong cord, wire up, jump on the piste, only to step down and break out the toolkit because their brand new 2-prong cord was giving them constant off-target lights. Many of our fencers that use 2-prong cords simply buy the socket ends and turn it over to our armorer to manufacture the actual cord for them because so many 2-prong cords failed right out of the box.  If the objective behind 'banning bayonets' is to make everyone standardize on 2-prong, then which 2-prong style do they pick? I can guarantee that there are multiple minor differences between 2-prong manufacturers that make them almost completely incompatible with each other. Will a Chinese-made 2-prong cord fit in a German-made or British-made 2-prong socket? Maybe, who knows?  The rumour posted here is that the FIE wanted to standardize equipment when using the wireless scoring system at international-level events, but that doesn't make sense. If everything produced by the manufacturers met FIE standards for electrical conductivity and still didn't play nicely with the STM wireless scoring equipment, we would have heard about it long before now."

Fencing,39xl1m,robotreader,5,Mon Jun 15 16:57:01 2015 UTC,"Third in another local event.  Literally slept my way through pools, finished 2-3.  First DE my first two touches didn't count because the ref forgot to rearm the machine, then got red-carded for ""elbowing my opponent in the mask"" because when I went into prime she ducked under my arm.  Ref agreed it wasn't a bell-punch, ref agreed it was an accident, ref agreed it wasn't violent, but card anyway because ""he needed to maintain control of the bout.""  Won anyway.  Worked on small blade movements starting from the tip, and it paid off in about six or seven flicks to the arm as she was coming forward.  One of the vets I'm friendly with upset the #1 seed in a fantastic bout.  He found what worked and stuck with it, and the #1 seed was so mad he couldn't adjust.  Simple parry-ripostes with good distance will work wonder sometimes.  So my second DE was against that vet, which was nothing special, although he did get some nice touches.  Lost to a guy I've been fencing for years, which I think is part of the problem.  His style hasn't changed much, but mine definitely has.  Since I've fenced him before, it's difficult for me to change how I fence him, even though my toolbox is different now.  Down 9-4, brought it back to 11-8, then lost 15-10 or so.  He's REALLY lanky, and none of my counterattacks were getting through, and he kept hitting me on the remise.  I need to be more creative on strip - the solution was likely to go low, and ignore  his bladework entirely.  Plus, I wasn't getting a good explosion on my fleche, so he was able to parry those."

First DE won 15-10, double out a lot at the end cause why try for singles if they're giving you doubles?  Second DE saw my opponent like to back up to the end of his strip so I let the first period get called for noncombativity as a test. Second period I chase him down, get hit. Get the next two touches, up 2-1. Then it was my turn to sit at the end of the strip which I did for two periods. Won 11-6.  Third DE fenced a guy I didn't know. Got some clean touches, he hit me on some stuff I wasn't expecting. Lost 15-14. So that happened.  Resting today from overextending my hip flexor but I'll be back at it tomorrow.

Went to a small local tournemt last weekend with some decent fencers (Ds and Es, a couple of Cs were signed up but never paid)  Fences in Y14 which was pretty easy, losty first pool bout against my toughest opponent. Mostly because I hadn't bothered to warm up I believe. Wrecked the rest ofy pool though. First DE against a newish fencer so it was pretty easy 15-6. Second bout was fairly easy but really tiring and bizarre. The other fencer ran me up and down the strip beating constantly. Annoying as heck for sure. Won 15-8. Then in finals I faced the person I lost to in pools, fenced a solid bout and come out on top 15-11 with the gold. Felt in control the whole bout but it was still really close.   Then I fenced in the open event. Blew through pools, going 5-1. Losing one 1-5 but holding the rest of my opponents below 2 points I believe. A bye and a fairly easy DE later I was fencing the person I lost to in pools for semifinals.   The guy was a D with great point control and a lot of big beats and deceives. I had thought that counterattacking would be the answer but that lost me the pool bout, so I tried something different. I baited him into making big beats and derobes them and attacked into the preparation. This got me up to 6-2 and I was feeling pretty good with myself. We traded back and forth on some really nice attacks, leaving us at 9-7 with me still in the lead. Then I got suckered in to some nice indirect counter repostes and we were tied at 10. My opens came in with a big prep so I immediately counter attacked in, he missed and I landed my tip right on his chest, but my light didn't go off and he reminded to put himself up 11-10. I tested my weapon and it seemed fine so I kept fencing, which was a mistake. I was a little shook by what had seemed like my weapon not working and he got in 2 quick touches. I then attacked in, pretty sure I hit but once again my weapon didn't go off and he nailed my with the remise of his reposte. I then switched my weapon. But I was down 14-10 now and things were looking grim.   I have struggled with getting frustrated with equient failure and getting behind for ages now, I was really happy though when managed to shake it off and returned to the guard line super focused. I rattled of 4 quick touches. Mixing up Abs de fer attacks with remise past his big counter parry 5. We were tied at 14 and all the momentum was on my side. I went in for another attack, but got caught in his party. when he closed the distance to remise he stepped on my ankle and knocked into me pretty bad. Sending me sprawling as the time ran out in the first period. After the break my momentum was completely gone and my back leg bothering me quite a bit. As soon as the red said fence the other guy exploded in and touched with a beat attack before I could open the distance enough to findy parry.   All in all super happy with my performance, really glad and proud of my sudden ability to find calm and get focused when I needed it the most. As I have been really struggling with the mental part of the bout recently.   TLDR: Fenced well at local competition possibly overcoming one of my major weeknesses!"
Fencing,39xl1m,Rather_Unfortunate,2,Mon Jun 15 19:41:06 2015 UTC,"I fought in a small local Open on Saturday. I came middling in the poules, so set myself the goal of winning the first round of DEs.  In the first round of DEs I ended up against someone who was nominally much better than me and my heart sank a bit, because I'd seen him beat the bookies' favourite in a previous competition. He was much, much stronger than me (and actually beat my blade right out of my hand when he caught it halfway through the match!), but I knew I was faster than him, so I made sure he didn't get to take my blade at all whilst constantly marking his wrist (I'm lefty, and wrist-hits seem to be something I'm good at), and ended up winning either 15-9 or 15-10, I don't remember.  The second round of DEs, the guy I fought was much better than myself, but was also frankly a bit of an overly-competitive knob. Especially for such a small competition with so few points on offer. Didn't even crack a smile when I was trying to chat before the match. Ugh. Don't be like him.  In the match itself, my sword stopped working halfway through, so I fought half the match with a pistol grip (I prefer my cantilever), but still did alright and managed to only lose 15-11.  I was pleased with myself overall, and one of our club members on her first competition managed to pick up a medal, which was a nice confidence boost for her I think."

Fencing,39qqek,dockingnow,5,Sat Jun 13 20:56:12 2015 UTC,What weapon? And what do you mean 'excellent and terrible'. A terrible line is probably not technically a line.
Fencing,39qqek,venuswasaflytrap,3,Sat Jun 13 21:19:12 2015 UTC,"For foil and yes, terrible would be not considered point in line."
Fencing,39qqek,venuswasaflytrap,1 point,Sat Jun 13 21:29:26 2015 UTC,http://youtu.be/8GzEKIrdlvE  http://youtu.be/n2NRxqgyNjM  Here are a couple actions that were not called line. The second one is borderline.  What is the reason for these videos? Is it for instruction on how and when to place a line as a fencer? Or are you looking for refereeing examples?
Fencing,39qqek,lkjpoiu,2,Sat Jun 13 21:44:39 2015 UTC,For the latter; I've been refereeing and point of line is difficult for me to see. Thank you for the links.
Fencing,39qqek,venuswasaflytrap,2,Sun Jun 14 04:22:37 2015 UTC,"Regarding the second one: I'm really having a hard time not giving that to the fencer on the left via derobement. His arm was out for almost a second before FOTR even moved. Never pulled back either, no wonder he asked for a replay."
Fencing,39qqek,lkjpoiu,2,Sun Jun 14 19:18:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this is specifically why I made this clip.  The written literal rules ultimately don't matter. All that matters is how it gets called.  This is an example, of one of best fencers in the world, with one of the most influential coaches, asking for video on an action, and still not getting it.  The point is, a line has to be very clear.   Yes it's possible that this call could go the other way, but ifcassara, with cerioni (at the time) arguing for him, doesn't get this call, even after video, the chances of another fencer getting a call for a line that isn't this clear are next to nil.  So, from a fencers point of view, that line better be out at least 2 or 3 steps before their attack, and if you derobe multiple searches, it's probably better. And you better not twist, or drop your shoulder at all."
Fencing,39qqek,venuswasaflytrap,1 point,Sun Jun 14 19:59:03 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the explanation, it was very helpful."
Fencing,39qqek,lkjpoiu,1 point,Mon Jun 15 07:18:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks - I understand that how it gets called is what matters and I agree with you. Though this is some god-awful interpretation of the rules. When both fencers, at the highest levels no less, are saying that it was a line, FIE needs to look into this ref.  There's a difference between a slight variation on the rules (t.10, t.56.3) and ""2 or three steps back before their attack and derobe multiple searches"".  I don't have an issue with a ridiculous decision on what constitutes point in line as long as it's decided and codified somehow. Even adding ""with a distance between the line and the attacking fencer greater than one advance lunge"" or similar would be good.  Imagine it in the other direction: the ref is calling it pseudo-""classically"" and every single time your opponent points his weapon at you, a line is established and all of your attacks are called as attacks into a line, or as attacks in prep for him. Now imagine that the person your fencing himself is disagreeing with the ref. You'd want someone at FIE to look into this kind of calling, no?  I know these incidents are generally isolated, but if this were football (which we know is directly corrupt) there would be a riot."
Fencing,39qqek,venuswasaflytrap,1 point,Mon Jun 15 10:37:28 2015 UTC,"What is god-awful about it?   First of all, both fencers aren't saying that it's a line. Cassara is, Marcilloux is pretty sure that it's his attack.  The ref sees an attack from Cassara that falls short, and an immediate indirect attack from Marcilloux that starts just before, or at the sane moment that Cassara places a line.  The ref considers Marcilloux's blade action to be an indirect action, rather than a search. Ultimately whenever a disengagement happens, particularly a counter disengagement, both fencers blades are going around each other. You need context to say which fencer searched.   So the ref sees an indirect attack that started before or as, the line was placed. It's a call that's completely in line with the written definition of the rules.  The problem is that, no matter what you write as a rule, there is always going to be different ways of reading, and interpreting the action. I suspect you're probably seeing a search from Marcilloux, and I suspect that you're not convinced that Marcilloux's attack began immediately after Cassara's initial attack failed.  But how do you write that down? Are you gonna say ""If the tip deviates from the target more than 40 degrees, in a spiral fashion, it's technically a search, not an indirect action""? Do you expect referees to have protractors? And even then, what do you say to the fencer that just attacks directly into everything, and constantly claims that the other fencers arm was bent 41 degrees? It's not like you have proof as a ref. Even with video, he'll just argue that it was bent parallel to the camera. Or that the bend includes the wrist or something weird.  So after all that increased specification, you still have something that is ultimately subjective. And ultimately there will need to just be a common established unwritten convention of what is or isn't an attack.  But we have that already. The world cup circuit is refereed by a fairly small pool of refs, and between them, in my experience they are actually fairly consistent.  This is a call from 2011, so it's a bit out of date, and even then, I would consider this call borderline. I think if you put it to them (in 2011), this action would get a split decisions. It might even be a majority for line, but it's worth pointing out that an FIE ref called it an attack on the day, and even went to video review (which requires a discussion with another ref) and stuck with the call. Saying that the FIE needs to look into this ref is completely baseless.  It goes to show roughly where the edge of what a line is. If the second action is borderline, then the previous action, has no hope in hell of ever being called a line (in 2011, and I would say, in 2015 too)."
Fencing,39qqek,SydneyAccount,1 point,Mon Jun 15 13:09:04 2015 UTC,"You realize that FOTR was moving backwards when the line was established, right? And don't you by your own account say that an attack cannot begin from moving backwards? (I remember reading you post that somewhere.) FOTL extends arm, FOTR takes a half retreat and then starts into an attack - FOTL does not break the line except for the derobement (which persists the line, yes?) and does not squirm or drop his shoulder save a half retreat (which again, persists a line).  I understand your reasoning, I just think it's idiotic to use it to defend this action. As much as my opinion doesn't matter, and I know that, I think it's dumb as hell that we consider this particular action to be ""borderline"".  I was mistaken about the agreement of the fencers, I misread your original comment."
Fencing,39qqek,venuswasaflytrap,1 point,Mon Jun 15 13:52:30 2015 UTC,"Yup, I stand by the idea that an attack can't happen moving backwards.  I guess where you and the ref disagree, is a question of when you think the line was in place, and whether you think it was in place early enough.  It doesn't really matter though - which is my whole point. You break down the action into little bits, and go over it in slow motion all that you like. You can say ""The are was straight before the attack started"", or whatever. It doesn't matter. This ref, and at least a few other FIE refs will call the line late.  I'm not really 'defending' the call in terms of the rules. My personal interpretation of the rules is not particularly relevant beyond my own aesthetic opinion. If the question is ""Do you personally like this call"", my opinion might matter. But the question seems to be ""Is this the Right call?"". For that I take my cues from FIE refs making calls at world cup levels.  In my experience this is not an extreme outlier of what gets called a line. It's an all right example for referees, because it can help refs gauge the timing of their calls. It's not ideal though, because, I agree with you, it's possible that the majority of FIE refs would call this the line, especially in 2015. But at very least you can say it's near where the edge would be.  It's a great example for fencers though. Because it shows a fairly strong attempt at a line, in world cup conditions, in a best case scenario in terms of influence. It's clear to me, that if you're a fencer, and you don't have Cassara on the back of your lame (and you have a good ref), if you want to expect a line to be called, then it has to be at least as clear as this one, if not clearer."
Fencing,39qqek,DOOFUS_NO_1,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:18:02 2015 UTC,"The problem is that, no matter what you write as a rule, there is always going to be different ways of reading, and interpreting the action.   I defer to your experience but I think this is a bit of a copout tbh. The divergence of the rules from how actions are called in practice aren't just a matter of interpretation - at least rule 56d seems to be flat out disregarded, or only applied in a way that seriously abuses the English language (query whether people on a French messageboard are having the same argument).  I think we could do better - rules can be rewritten to be clearer. They do it with actual laws, sometimes. Perhaps there's an intent not to so as to give the FIE more flexibility.    But we have that already. The world cup circuit is refereed by a fairly small pool of refs, and between them, in my experience they are actually fairly consistent.   I appreciate that this is sufficient for serious competitors who will be watching a bunch of these videos anyway. Good point!"
Fencing,39qqek,venuswasaflytrap,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:34:54 2015 UTC,"Well, suppose I have a line, and make a small counter 6 parry, while keeping my arm straight. If you just attack straight, there is a good chance I'll pick up your blade and successfully parry. But if you disengage, then it might look like you tried to find my blade in 4.   Cus really, we both just circled each other's blades. It's very hard to determine the intention of the fencers from the refs position. What makes something a search, and what makes it a derobe? How do you even word that? It could easily be that the parry is smaller than the disengagement.  And when is someone point in line? It's quite easy to have your arm straight and meet the literal criteria of the line.p, depending on what you mean by ""threaten"". You could probably fence a whole bout with a straight arm.  But I think if I'm dodging and ducking, and trying to find and close out the blade with my guard, even though my line is 'technically' straight and 'technically' threatening the target, it still doesn't count as a line.  The unwritten rules are that you need to balanced, with your shoulder in line, and confident with the action, and you can't duck or dodge or try to close with your guard.  So you could argue 'well just add those rules then'. But that doesn't help. Pone you need to define what a duck or dodge is. You need to say what closing a line is. And suddenly people start saying ""I didn't dodge, that's just my normal en guard"" or ""he closed out the sixth line just by being in the point in line position"" etc. there's more written rules, but no more actual clarity.  And I'm not saying that cassara dodged or closed or whatever. But it makes sense for referees to make calls that set boundaries on actions.  What you don't want, is two fencers with locked arms jumping into each other and arguing for lines or counter attacks or whatever. You want the fencers to make distinct actions, not a series of close borderline situations.  Cassara makes an attack that falls short, and follows it up with a line against a attack that is more or less immediate. This situation is quite unique in that he makes a pretty clean attempt at the line, and marcelloux could be argued to be a little slow on the takeover. But the ref doesn't want to be judging the rest of the bout with situations like that.  The message is ""no, you made an attack that fell short, and he took over, it's his attack. If you want a line, you need to make it clear in both execution and in choice of when you place it"".  Cus the narrative of the action is attack no, immediate attack against the line. It makes a cleaner bout if everyone respects this narrative."

This is not normally done with a wind-up but more of a squeeze of the hand on the grip to take advantage of the blades momentum as it comes into contact with theirs. This has the advantage of taking their blade out of position while leaving yours in relatively good position.  In foil, I'd just coupee around your ""swing"" and then hit you with my ROW. In epee, I'd just attack into your preparation."
Fencing,39pd9u,WildZontar,2,Sat Jun 13 19:19:12 2015 UTC,"The thing is, while your tip is pointed way off to the side it takes significantly longer to bring it in for a touch than if you have the blade in line with target. At low levels, it might work. Against opponents who are significantly worse than you it might work. But at intermediate and higher levels against opponents close to your skill or better, swinging wide is just going to get you hit more often than not.

Fencing,39pd9u,venuswasaflytrap,13,Sat Jun 13 22:06:24 2015 UTC,"It's important to understand that sword fighting didn't evolve as different people finding the all out best way to kill each other in a ruleless battle.  There is tons of technological and social context that effected the form a nature of european sword fighting.  First it's worth considering that a single handed sword and buckler was more common long swords: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GiI1sCAd_Hk  Then consider that the rapier came from a civilian tradition, rather than a battle field. At the time the rapier started appearing, military battles were starting to be contested between men carrying muskets, and formations of pikemen, and other such things. You wouldn't see an army of men all armed primarily with rapiers (of course nothing would prevent someone from bringing all sorts of different weapons into battle).  Instead the rapier came as a weapon for civilian duelling. Grossly simplifying a ton of history, if the other guy isn't wearing armour, and you both have one handed swords, trying to out reach the other guy and poke him is a better way to kill him. So you make a thin long pointy sword.  There was a lot of push back, in different countries, when the rapier started showing up. People said it wasn't honorable. They argued that it wasn't as useful. But it ended up becoming 'a thing', and for a while it was the weapon of choice. And keep in mind that the popularity doesn't only come from the actual usefulness of the weapon - fashion plays a large role.  But rapiers are still fairly heavy weapons, and modern fencing doesn't derive directly from them. As time marched on, people still wanted to wear swords and have duels and maintain honor and all that, but they also found that long rapiers were cumbersome to wear.   So weapons became smaller and lighter. Of course this meant the style of use changed too, which has it's own advantages (you can manipulate a smaller weapon faster), so I think it's hard to disentangle whether it was fashion, or fencing development that changed the weapons. They both did and influenced each other.  And on top of that, the social conditions of how duels were fought changed, depending on the time and place. Duelling throughout it's history has rarely ever been ""Kill the other guy anyway you can"". There are things that you can and can't do.   Just like if a friend of yours, who you're feuding with, throws a punch at you in a bar, it's not really okay to run away and hide, grab a broken bottle, and sneak up on him later and slit his throat. There aren't official 'rules' to bar fights, but some things just aren't done.  Additionally, fencing has been sportified for a long time.   Here's a picture depicting a fencing club in London in 1787.  http://www.rakehell.com/covers/AngeloA.jpg  Notice that the blades are blunted and bending, and there is a guy wearing a padded fencing jacket and a mask.   Yes some of them were there to practice for duels, but the sport side of it had already taken on a life of it's own.   So you have to understand that modern fencing is quite far removed from medieval sword fighting, in a lot of different ways. It's not as simple as ""Whats the best way to kill someone"". The answer probably would have been ""Shoot them"". Fencing is better thought of as a modern incarnation of a sportified version of duelling.  TL:DNR: Partner swapping can be a fulfilling and trust building experience, that can help establish a long and happy (and open) relationship."
Fencing,39pd9u,venuswasaflytrap,1 point,Sat Jun 13 23:12:28 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I think I get what you're saying. A powerful swing is used to actual manage to kill the target, but in fencing any hit counts. So we go right for the kill. Plus, chivalry."
Fencing,39pd9u,twoslow,7,Sat Jun 13 23:34:52 2015 UTC,"Well, more that different swords are for different things.  A rapier is pretty good at killing a guy with shorter cutting weapon and no armour. A spear or pike is better still, cus you can hurt them from further away. But you can't socially carry a pike around.   A longsword is better at cleaving through a bunch of semi armoured people in a big battle. A war hammer is probably better at going through armour.  And modern guns are gonna be more useful than all of them.  Modern fencing is entirely a sport. We aren't going 'for the kill'. We are trying to make a light go on.   I guess it's kinda like asking ""wouldn't a musket do more damage at laser tag?""."

I am reminded of the Heinzer gif posted the other day. Would that be swinging? People definitely use large actions like that, sometimes as ""bait""—using a large sweeping/swinging action to make it look like they are opening up a line of attack but really it is a trap.

Swinging the weapon isn't illegal, but it is often imprecise and impractical. If you hit your opponent, you can expect a pretty good chance of being carded (maybe for brutality, maybe for something else), but if you don't, you should be fine.   The most logical use of a swinging motion would be a wide parry, which could be good if landed to bring your opponent's weapon out far, but there are often better ways to do that without sacrificing follow-up, so you would have to have a plan that includes also having your weapon out far."

Does the ""Qualification"" tab in the google doc show how they will determine the top 14 fencers for Rio? For instance, Matyas Szabo, who is ranked 23rd in the world (on the fie website), is 4th on the list after doing well in crucial tournaments--European champs and Moscow. So my question is, are only the points from those specific competitions listed in the google doc used to determine the top 14 fencers in the world?   Thanks!!"
Fencing,39m480,empress_ardelyn,2,Sat Jun 13 02:37:02 2015 UTC,This spreadsheet only includes the points that would be used for Olympic qualification.   The FIE rankings are rolling points that include last seasons events until the new event replies those points.

Fencing,39jzyw,white_light-king,4,Sat Jun 13 13:49:28 2015 UTC,"Good news, our newish club has a lot of kids in the 11-14 year old range who've been fencing a few months now.   I want to start thinking about moving them to pistol grips (we started with a big bag of frenchs.)  The thing about pistol grips is that they're all different shapes and sizes.  What's the best (by which I mean cheapest and laziest) way to collect an assortment of foils with different grips so kids can try things?"
Fencing,39jzyw,perivane,3,Fri Jun 12 14:35:38 2015 UTC,We keep an assortment of grips on some cheap (~$30) chinese blades for new fencers to try out.
Fencing,39jzyw,toolofthedevil,3,Fri Jun 12 15:36:21 2015 UTC,"So the fencing master at our club is considerably older and very French. He demands that all the classes be run on French grips.   To address that, the club only keeps French grips ""in stock"" but foil students are encouraged, when they but their own, to get a pistol grip.   This inevitably leads to this conversion of ""there's so many options what do."" Typically, I just recommend a size for a visconti style grip and tell them they can try other grips later when they see a vendor at an event or something like that. If later never comes, a visconti is totally fine for like 99% of fencers."
Fencing,39jzyw,white_light-king,2,Fri Jun 12 18:32:03 2015 UTC,"I like this idea, since I don't like belgians or russians personally.  Any guesses for an ideal range of visconti sizes for a mixed gender group of 11-14 year olds and a couple adult students?"

Fencing,39jzyw,Zach-out-of-the-Box,3,Sun Jun 14 03:48:12 2015 UTC,"How come some fencers let the time run out after the ref has started the bout? I have watched many videos of fencers who wait in en guard, and when the ref calls fence, they stand up and wait for the time to run out, and I have never understood why."
Fencing,39jzyw,venuswasaflytrap,6,Fri Jun 12 15:00:57 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of reasons, but ultimately it happens when neither fencer wants to fence for the remaining time.  The most common example is when there are less than 10 or so seconds left before a break. Both fencers know that it will take longer to gain any control over the action, and neither one really thinks it's worth it to try to fit a full exchange in the remaining time.  Maybe they're both tired. Maybe they both want a chance to regroup. Regardless, both fencers sort of mutually agree to go to the break, even though time has not run out. Normally the ref just goes with it.  If one fencer wants to fence right to time, however, they can do so and the other fencer is effectively forced to do so too."
Fencing,39jzyw,SephoraRothschild,2,Fri Jun 12 15:07:30 2015 UTC,"What are everyone's thoughts on fencing at Sanctioned tournaments...that are referee'd only by the participants in your pool(AKA ""reffed out of pools"", ""self-directed"")? How are we feeling about that these days?"
Fencing,39jzyw,FractalBear,5,Fri Jun 12 16:03:45 2015 UTC,"I started competing heavily in Northern California after a strong push for more refs. So I'm used to it and love it.   But I moved to Southern California and almost everything aside from the big opens are self reffed. It's usually fine but it's not ideal and sometimes leads to awkward situations and not everyone pulling their weight.   In short, I'd pay more for my tournament to have a ref."
Fencing,39jzyw,SephoraRothschild,2,Fri Jun 12 18:34:15 2015 UTC,"In short, I'd pay more for my tournament to have a ref.   That's part of what I'm having trouble accepting. I encouraged our town's primary Club to hold a Tournament. They haven't done so for a decade. They finally decide to have one. Awesome. Entry fee was $25-1st event/$15-2nd event through Wednesday; now $30/25. Okay. Not uncommon, especially in large clubs in large cities with a lot of fencers. This however is a small-ish Club, and aside from venue rental--which yes, I get that rental is a big problem these days--I'm not sure that (what I consider to be) high registration fees are warranted when pools are self-directed."
Fencing,39jzyw,FractalBear,2,Fri Jun 12 19:07:32 2015 UTC,My gut reaction is no more than $20 for a self reffed event. I've never seen it more than that in SoCal at least.

As an advocate of low level events using self-reffing to keep prices down, though, it's not standard and it has to be announced. Has to be."
Fencing,39jzyw,FractalBear,2,Sat Jun 13 04:50:15 2015 UTC,"Agreed on that being cheap. And I'm certainly not demanding it be that price point. I'm willing to pay more if the circumstances are right. But I do appreciate the cheap aspect as a big believer in getting better by competing as much as humanly possible.  Also, generally when I think self-reffed I assume that's all of pools and probably most bouts in the 32 and 16."

Fencing,39jzyw,K_S_ON,2,Sat Jun 13 04:48:15 2015 UTC,"It's widely criticized, since the era of ""professional referees"". It used to be common practice, especially in epee. We'd hire a couple of refs who would drift around and take a pool here and there, and would do all the bouts from the 8 on up or so, but we'd self ref in the pools.   I sort of liked it. Everyone had to know the rules, it kept behavior under control since we had all tried to ref and understood that sometimes you just miss stuff, it was in many ways better than what we have now. There are very good epee refs out there, but there are also people reffing epee because they're the worst ROW refs in the room. I'd far rather self ref in the pools and early DEs than have the worst blue blazer in the room reffing my pool."

Which is why I put quotes around it.    The point of ""professional referees"" movement is to bring the sport into some level of uniform fair play.    The point of instituting ""professional referees"" in the US some decades ago was to cut into some of the cheating that went on in the ROW weapons. We now have far less cheating in ROW weapons. Is that a result of changing how refs work and how they're administered and how they dress? Or of video review and widespread cheap video cameras, so bad calls can be repeated and pointed at and refs can no longer just make up actions and claim they happened? Or some combination of the two?  I think the changes in US reffing have for the most part been good. But there have been some costs, as I noted.   Its an Olympic sport, which means some level of standardized, impartial refereeing is required.    That actually doesn't follow, really. We were an Olympic sport in the 80s when I learned to fence, and when we often reffed out of pools at local events.  Sailing is an Olympic sport. Local events in sailing are uniformly adjudicated by local sailors, someone who's not sailing that day is on the committee boat and calls who's over early and who had rights at the mark. This is much more like fencing was in the 80s than it is what fencing is like today, but sailing is an Olympic sport too.  It does not follow that an Olympic sport must be judged by non-participants at local levels of competition. It just doesn't.   Which means referees need to be developed, which means it has to start at the local level.   US ref development leaves so much to be desired I hardly know where to start. None of that has much to do with OP's question, which I think my reply answered pretty well."

Please expand; what do you think the difference is?   It does since the IOC started cracking down on subjective officiation, of which Fencing is a major offender.    I think the IOC cares a lot about good reffing at the international and perhaps even the elite national levels. I've never seen anything that indicated to me that they cared at all about how we ref the Duckbarn D and Under Annual Mixed Epee and Barbeque Classic. I mean, really? Do you think the IOC cares if a local non-elite event has guys in blue blazers reffing, or self-reffing out of pools? Really?"
Fencing,39jzyw,SephoraRothschild,1 point,Sat Jun 13 03:07:44 2015 UTC,"I'm a Division Chair. I definitely care if individuals who have passed the USA Fencing/FOC Referee Exam, both the written and the practical test, who are also paying members of USA Fencing and who are hired to proctor bouts at USA Fencing Events by Tournament Organizers--If they're functioning in that capacity, and it's not 80 degrees in the venue, and I'm hiring them, then I want them to wear the jacket. For one, they earned it. Two, a blazer is a visual indicator to everyone else at the venue that that person is an Official. I want my officials to be treated with respect and professionalism, and that's more readily given by both spectators (parents/coaches/everyone else) and fencers if they're wearing that jacket. No, it's not an absolute, but it sure goes a long way toward setting the precedent for all of us to ensure Referees are given the respect they are due.   Having said that...if they're at my club, and I hired them, I'm not going to be a jerk if they don't show up with a jacket. I prefer it, but the fact that they're taking time out of their day to proctor my Tournament is an honor by itself. So you have to be flexible.   Yes, IOC is not local, but that doesn't mean we should allow our Referees to be treated differently simply because they don't have an FIE license behind their name."
Fencing,39jzyw,K_S_ON,2,Sat Jun 13 04:28:15 2015 UTC,"I think my point was not clear. I'm not saying hired refs should not wear a blue jacket, I don't really care about that. I'm saying that in many local events, a better experience would be had by all if we went back to taking turns reffing each other in the pools, especially in epee, and only turned to hired refs for the upper levels of the DEs.  I'm aware that this is not going to happen, and that I'm marching against the tide of history, and that parents would squeal if Precious lost a touch because a kid in the pool called something wrong, and that many people don't agree with me. That's fine. But seriously, I fenced (and was a Division Chair, for that matter) before the ""professionalization"" of reffing, and I've fenced since, and it's not an unmixed blessing.  So OP, way back upthread, asked if it was normal or ok or what people thought for a local event to be self reffing out of pools, and I told him/her what I thought. Perhaps you think something different, and you'd be willing to share that with OP, and then s/he will have a variety of opinions to choose from and will thus be enriched. Ok?"

For example, you would use the first one to describe someone who was refereeing a bout in their own pool, i.e., not a referee or professional.

I was not, but that's often a signal that the conversation is nearing the end of its useful life. I'll respond to this and then I think I'm done.    I am so intrigued by this argument. Please expand; what do you think the difference is?   Scare quotes on different places emphasize different things. Here's an explanation for you since you're not familiar.   I understand how scare quotes work. I did not and do not understand what you were trying to communicate with your distinction, but it's probably not vital to the fate of the world that we hammer the whole thing out here.   For example, you would use the first one to describe someone who was refereeing a bout in their own pool, i.e., not a referee or professional.    But someone reffing a bout in their own pool is a referee. If the rules refer to the referee, that's who they're talking about. That person is not being paid, and is not dressed in a blue blazer, but let us not confuse that with being a referee. If you're reffing, you're the ref.   The second would be used to describe a paid referee who sucks or doesn't take it seriously, i.e. a referee but not professional.   Ah. I was not using the term in that manner here, although I think it's a valid usage. I was thinking of a professional as someone who is being paid for their work.   If we do adopt your definition I think we have a lot of confusion, since I think many people reffing out of pools as fencers take reffing, especially epee reffing, a lot more seriously than do bad ROW refs who have been assigned to epee pools. That's probably an entirely different conversation we don't have to have here, but ""sucks and doesn't take it seriously"" and ""not getting paid for reffing"" are not at all the same set of refs.    I mean, really? Do you think the IOC cares if a local non-elite event has guys in blue blazers reffing, or self-reffing out of pools? Really?   Of course they don't. But the IOC puts pressure on the FIE which puts pressure on the USFA which is an NGB that has the responsibility of developing referees directly.

Would you have preferred me to write an essay instead of my earlier comment, drawing the specific lines to make it more comprehensible?   I understand your argument. But the IOC also puts pressure on US Sailing, for example, to develop sailing officials. US Sailing is an NGB, and has to develop officials for international events. And yet, US Sailing reaches down not at all into local events.   So, as I tried to point out before, as a general principle your argument doesn't work. You can try to make a specific argument just for fencing, and why it's important the annual D and Under Epee event I run have paid refs, but that argument cannot be based on general principles of ""we do this because Olympics"". We don't. The IOC doesn't care how we develop refs. To develop refs for international events, we in no way need to put pressure on local events to all have paid refs.  Anyway, I've typed that out twice now and I think I'm done. Have a nice weekend.  Edit: I a word."
Fencing,39jzyw,OzymandiasTheGreat,2,Sun Jun 14 02:30:26 2015 UTC,"Not a fan. For your tiny little events with a clear recreational focus, sure, but at the more competitive ones it can cause all sorts of problems.  I've even been to tournaments where every fencer had to ref a bout, so you had this 14-year-old with no experience reffing outside of practice calling an adrenaline-filled semifinal between two cross-town rivals with national points. I offered to ref in his stead, but the BC said that he needs to get his turn, so by the end of the bout, both fencers were pissed, the ref was on the verge of tears, and I could only sit on the sidelines.  That being said, at some of these tournaments, the organizers pay attention to which of their fencers are rated/experienced refs, so that those fencers get all the bouts. That takes care of a lot of the problem.  Regardless, I think hiring referees shows your competitors and the sport due respect."

Fencing,39jzyw,venuswasaflytrap,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:26:07 2015 UTC,"Hate it, but its a reality in the UK.  It ends up meaning that in foil there are whole groups of actions that you can't trust to be consistently called, due to inconsistent reffing. I think this ends up causing the national fencing style to become quite out of sync with international style.  So then you get this weird situation where the skills to be successful domestically are fairly different than the skills needed to be good internationally.  Which leads to all sorts of knock on effects - National squads purposely avoiding domestic tournaments, having high ranked fencers on paper that are known to be 'domestically good', etc.  Though this is less of a problem with lack of pro refs in and of itself, and more to do with fencings (little c) conservative culture."

Both fencers start at the en garde line and each fencer takes a turn doing a step lunge trying to touch their opponent's shoulder.

Do for 30 seconds before rotating.   Glove capture. I don't know the actual name of it so I just made that up. Both fencers start at the en garde line, weaponless. There is a glove in the middle of the strip. On the coach's go, both fencers advance to the glove and try to pick it up. You must retreat with the glove back past your starting line to win.    one variation is if you pick up the glove first, your opponent can tag you and then they have the right-of-way and must retreat past their start line to win. You can tag back as many times until someone crosses their start line A more advanced variation includes the tagging but with a best of 5 series. Both fencers start on the en garde line. Fencer A wins the first contest. Fencer A now starts at the 2M warning line. If Fencer A wins, they must start from the end of the strip. If Fencer A wins again, they have won the challenge."

Fencing,39jzyw,motyatucker,2,Fri Jun 12 16:20:05 2015 UTC,"You mean, fencer A has the march/right of way/attack, and A beats Fencer B's blade just because? First, that is rarely an effective tactic (you already have right of way, beating the opponent's blade doesn't gain you anything, but risks the beat being called B's parry or beat). Second, it informs B where A's blade is.   How do you deal with someone offensively beating the blade, messing up your defense? Easiest is disengage, but the beat has to be sloppy enough to be called a search (attack is no, B's attack arrives), or you disengage to continue your defense. Not always successful. If you're the counter attacking type: disengage with counter, accelerate out of range from their attack. Most effective is to do prior drills with beat-parry-riposte.   Fencer A has told you exactly where his/her blade is. Worse, beginning fencers who do this often attempt to complete their attack when they get the offensive beat they want so you know exactly when they are attacking. So you always know, they beat from 4, you parry 4 riposte (or beat their blade in return). With some drilling, this becomes an automatic reaction to beat attacks. Or, take a small, quick retreat to make their beat-attack fall short.  Cheese mode: if you know your director is not very good, if you see Fencer A's beat, beat into their beat. It'll be called yours; the director will assume it was your action because you are on defense.   edit: just noticed you had the idea of using absence to avoid the beat attacks. If it is indeed offensive beats as I'm presuming, that is not a good idea. The false belief of the offensive beat is to remove the opponent's defense to complete a single tempo, simple attack. If you go into absence on your defense, you have removed your blade and your defense for your opponent. Absence on defense in sabre is usually considered a very poor defense with few means of executing many defensive actions."
Fencing,39jzyw,BeardedFencer,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:44:30 2015 UTC,Thank you. This is good. I actually left this vague because I was curious about both stopping beats as a preparation to a true attack but also as part of a counter.  Context: there are two folks near where I fence who love beats so much they basically do them more than half the time when they attack whether they have priority or not. So this also includes a situation where I'm on the march and they counterattack beginning with a beat. This is where I was curious about the use of absence of blade.

Run through them in numerical order and your point traces the letter Z. For Zorro, of course.  Only works if you are right-handed, though."
Fencing,39iu50,BlueStraggler,5,Fri Jun 12 00:59:21 2015 UTC,If you left handed it spells Sorro
Fencing,39iu50,BeardedFencer,3,Fri Jun 12 01:02:02 2015 UTC,"Is quarte supinated to you? I've always done it pronated. I'm also finding people are 50-50 on this one.  Also I'm skeptical of its history as a supinated party. Why would 1-3 be pronated, with 4 supinated, then 5 pronated again, then 6-8 be supinated?  But the numbering is fucked up too I suppose. It should be 1-4 all pronated, and then 5 should be low inside line supinated where septime is now. 6 should be where octave is, and so on. That way you should just add 4 to get to the supinated parries.  I think the classical Italian system makes way more sense. Number the lines 1-4 and then separately deal with forearm rotation. Hand blocking line 2 and hand in position 3. I suppose it's cumbersome to say though."
Fencing,39iu50,venuswasaflytrap,5,Fri Jun 12 07:38:28 2015 UTC,"There is a lot of historical cruft in the numbering. 1-4 are derived from the Renaissance Italian system, which was based on rotation of the hand through four cardinal points (1=thumb at 6 o'clock, 2=thumb at 9 o'clock, 3=thumb at 12 o'clock, 4=thumb at 3 o'clock). The French system modified these so that the numbers were based on the position of the point relative to the hand, but kept the basic numbering scheme. They then added 4 more, by inverting the hand position in each of those cases. So there isn't really any rhyme or reason to the order, unless you go back 400 years.  Anyway, in the French system, 4 is supinated or more likely semi-supinated (thumbnail up). A position where your palm is fully down and the knuckles are up is technically a French 5. This has become more popular in recent decades because we have become a lot better at flicking from pronated positions, whereas classically a pronated hand position was weak for attacks, providing less finger control over the point. But that's more so-called ""International School"" than classical French school. A true French system is performed with a French grip, after all.  It's also important to point out that the numbering systems are different in different schools. I've described the French system. In the Italian system, you would not use a 6, you would use a 3 - but it would be the same parry for all intents and purposes. I've run into German-trained fencers who have a very different idea of what 7 and 2 are. So there are a lot of conflicting ideas about 4 out there, and they are not necessarily wrong. The ""9"" mentioned by OP is simply not part of the French system, but I've come across in in some eastern European texts (where it seems to resemble an elevated French 8 that protects the flank and back)."
Fencing,39iu50,BlueStraggler,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:38:07 2015 UTC,"Do you know the origin of that?  I've read the science of fencing by Gaugler, so I'm familiar with the Italian system, but I'm not really clear on the progression.  Just from my light reading, it looks like Agrippa was one of the first to number guards, rather than have funny names for them - but it seems like the number is still very prescriptive of a whole body position, rather than descriptive of a hand position.  Trying to piece it together on a rough timeline, that looks like rapier fencing, in the mid 1500s.  Further on, I can see that Besnard has similar numbering systems:   Remembering that the old masters made quarta and terza parry in a high as well as in a low line, Besnard’s definition of seconde will appear less strange to modern fencers. “The thrust in seconde is delivered in two ways, ‘tierce en seconde’ (nails down), and ‘quarte en seconde’ (nails up).” Both are on the inside of the sword.   So that doesn't seem to match up with either the modern french or classical Italian system.  I dunno, it seems like a total clusterfuck, with every master having a slightly different numbering system. It's weird to think that we still don't have a standardized system."
Fencing,39iu50,venuswasaflytrap,2,Fri Jun 12 15:57:55 2015 UTC,"It was Agrippa who rationalized the chaos of Renaissance systems. The 4 positions certainly existed before him, but there were tons of names and variations. He was working off of Marozzo before him, who had close to a dozen positions, for instance. Agrippa simplified and provided focus (for instance by advocating use of the point over cuts), which let him boil it all down to its essence.  In some respects, the refusal of fencing to standardize is part of its genius. It has constructed it's rules to be ""system-agnostic"" which gives maximum freedom to coaches and players to beat the system and evolve the game. Compare with a sport like kendo, which has very strict notions of correctness and tradition that must be followed, and tends to keep the sport much more tightly bound with its past, rather than leaving it open to an uncertain future."
Fencing,39iu50,BlueStraggler,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:26:33 2015 UTC,"But Agrippa's nomenclature doesn't really match up with any modern sensibilities that I'm familiar with beyond the idea of using numbers for positions.  There doesn't seem to be the concept of lines, or supination/pronation. Prima, to agrippa, was an entire position of the body including foot position, not just anything pronated in the low inside line.    I also think that universally standardized descriptive nonmenclature is incredibly useful for development, the key point that it must be descriptive rather than prescriptive. By having a language to describe body position and movement, you can convey ideas much faster. Though I do agree that having a prescriptive definition of something like quarte does hamper progress."
Fencing,39iu50,venuswasaflytrap,2,Fri Jun 12 16:38:46 2015 UTC,"Fencing separates the developmental aspects from the analytical aspects. Analysis (refereeing) is internationally standardized based on the minimum set of concepts that are necessary to determine scoring. So we have standardized definitions of things like attacks and parries (not particular lines, just whether or not a parry occurred) and tempo.  But the developmental aspects are pushed out to particular schools of fencing, which each have their own nomenclatures, systems, and preferences. It is definitely confusing, but it creates a very competitive environment that is good for the sport. Different schools will often develop with the specific goal of defeating the successful techniques of a rival school, so their developmental theory can sometimes be directly opposed to that of their rival. That's much harder to pull off in a homogenous theoretical framework. The end result is a much more dynamic sport that evolves rapidly, which is quite remarkable for a sport that is basically a 500-year-old martial art.  This was generally much clearer 50+ years ago when the French, Italian, Hungarian, and other systems were much more distinct. There has been a lot of convergence and cross-pollination in the modern international environment, however, that brings the conflicting concepts of different schools into much closer proximity.  Edit: also, WRT to Agrippa, our modern 1, 2, 3, and 4 are not really variations of his original positions. It is more like we can trace the evolution of the modern 1, 2, 3, and 4 back to Agrippa, before whom everything gets quite wacky. In that sense, Agrippa is some kind of Australopithecus of fencing; the first to walk around on 2 feet and do things that we would recognize as vaguely like us."
Fencing,39iu50,BlueStraggler,2,Fri Jun 12 18:53:56 2015 UTC,"Beck at Tauber simplified all the hand positions to 'thumb at two', for all parries but prime:  http://msfc.wikispaces.com/file/view/WGEpeeTotal.pdf  This has become very widespread, I think, even if a coach is not German or using the Beck system. I see a lot of modern coaches teach six, four and eight with the thumb at something between twelve and two o'clock."

Fencing,39iu50,twoslow,4,Fri Jun 12 13:51:05 2015 UTC,"From Schools and Masters of Fencing: From the Middle Ages to the Eighteenth Century -Castle 1885    Agrippa was an educated man, who had taken up swordsmanship with a scientific interest, and naturally detected the fundamental errors of the popular modes of fencing, and devised a much simpler system.  One of the most obvious errors was the number of different guards, connected with each other by the most artificial ties, and each of which afforded opportunities for only a limited number of strokes, whereas every possible kind of hit can be delivered from any one position in which the sword is held in front of the body and menacing the adversary.   [...]   Accordingly, discarding all the old-fashioned fantastical titles, he reduced the number of useful guards to four, giving them plain numerical names, “prima, seconda, terza, quarta.”  It so happens that, as far as the position of the hand is concerned, those guards have some kind of relation to our prime, seconde, tierce, and carte. As a practical man, the author wisely considered the first guard to be assumed in the act of drawing the sword: men did not then stand on much punctilio in matters of fighting, and, in a quarrel, to draw and to be on guard had to be one action.  A long “rapier” could not be whipped out as deftly as a court sword ; before the point had left the scabbard the hand was above the head. Accordingly, the position of a man who had just drawn and turned his point to his adversary’s face, was Agrippa’s first guard. Both feet were on the same line, the body slightly bent."

Fencing,39cwho,K_S_ON,3,Thu Jun 11 12:54:31 2015 UTC,"He didn't just run backwards every time, though. He scored several times on N. chasing him, by lunging into a step. Then N. opened the distance some, and H. adjusted by making it a fleche into the step.  I agree he's comfortable a the back line, but a vital part of that, I think, is that to get to the back line you have to take a lot of steps forward, and H. loves to attack into a stepping opponent. So he pulls and pulls, and if N. keeps his distance and doesn't get sucked in H. is at his back line and he's like, ok, I like it here too, hope you get anxious and push too much.   He wants to close, that's his thing. So watch him as he pulls and looks for a time to close, and then watch him at the end of the strip as he looks for a good time to close. To me, his game is all about how he can take in eight and get inside, he's always looking for that. But if he chases you to try to close you have a lot of time to try to hit him as he comes in. So, in some cases at least, instead of pushing to close, he pulls.  That's my impression, anyway. Interesting to see how different people think about it."
Fencing,39cwho,FractalBear,2,Thu Jun 11 02:33:02 2015 UTC,"After watching this and the other Heinzer video posted, it's clear that he is comfortable going backwards and in his box. You don't necessarily need to get pushed back to go backwards.   In this case Novosjolov was pushing hard since it was the final encounter, but he was pushing Heinzer into a zone where he was still comfortable which is probably part of why Heinzer was able to secure so many doubles for much of the match."
Fencing,39cwho,BeardedFencer,2,Thu Jun 11 17:17:31 2015 UTC,"I was talking to Another coach the other night about this.  Why do épée fencers feel so comfortable being in a position that they can't be pushed back?  Why not just treat any place on the strip as the last step and just fight where (in a bad situation) you can take a step back?  What ams I missing? You're very comfortable back there, I'm also very comfortable pushing you back there... You beat me more often than not so maybe there is something to that?"
Fencing,39cwho,FractalBear,3,Thu Jun 11 05:15:36 2015 UTC,"I think there is a lot of psychology at play for both fencers when one fencer can't take another step back.   One could in principle choose any place on the strip as where they'll hold their ground and employ the same tactics, but I don't think it would put the defender in the same spot psychologically, and it certainly wouldn't put the attacker in the same spot since they know that the defender can step back if they want.  My brain really doesn't want to explicate the psychology right now (it doesn't help that I lack any rigorous knowledge in sport psych.), but I'll try my best and hopefully someone else can chime in.  When both fencers are in the warning box it tends to increase the intensity and tension of the bout. And I think this holds true to some extent at all levels. For the attacker, I think it more often then not increases their level of aggression and bloodthirst. They know the defender is losing defensive options so they want to push that advantage. Whereas for the defender they know that an attack is more likely, and probably a strong one. They have less defensive options, but they also know better what their opponent is likely to do. Depending on the fencer, they may thrive in these sorts of situations, or the increased intensity will break them.  And in conclusion, I don't think it's necessarily the norm that epee fencers are comfortable back there. A lot of fencing happens between the two warning lines. But I think you're more inclined to notice intentional fencing in the box since that seems strange to you."

Fencing,39cwho,K_S_ON,3,Thu Jun 11 20:50:55 2015 UTC,"Theoretically, yes.   The one thing about being backed up is your opponent can get brave and inch a little too close. Heinzer makes sure to take advantage of that mistake every time.   Another thing from the opponent's perspective is that you know Heinzer can't retreat, so if you attack you know he has nowhere to go. Heinzer loves to be in that situation. If you are at the start line, you know Heinzer can retreat. Essentially, Heinzer gives up a position which most people consider advantageous in order for the game to be played into his strength.. attacking opponents who get too close."
Fencing,39cwho,ScallopOolong,2,Thu Jun 11 12:54:19 2015 UTC,My other post attempts to address this. The psychology of the fencers is different in the warning box and it puts constraints that can't be simulated faithfully by just holding your ground.

Are you gripping the epee like you're trying to choke a weasel? Are you pulling back before you beat or take? Is your shoulder all tight and high? Are you winging your elbow out? Is your movement too lateral or circular, and not forward enough? Who can say? There are other subreddits that this could be more usefully applied to, but it bears saying here, too: You can't learn to fence by reading words on a page.  So, is there a decent coach near you? Even one you can only get to once a month or so? Can you go take a lesson or six, identify the problem, talk to the coach about what you're doing right and wrong, go home and practice? If you have a practice buddy, buy or make a padded vest and nail your technique down and work. If you don't have a practice buddy, build a dummy. PM me if you want the plans.  I'm sorry if I sound discouraging; I spent years of my youth trying to learn fencing without actually getting off my butt and going to take lessons. It was a mistake. If there's a decent coach anywhere near you and you can get to him/her, go. If you can't afford it, the best thing you can do for your fencing right now is go bag groceries for twenty hours or so.  All IMO, of course.  Good luck!"
Fencing,39bk09,K_S_ON,2,Wed Jun 10 19:20:13 2015 UTC,"not op, but Id like a copy of those plans, if thats possible!"
Fencing,39bk09,DukeBaird,2,Wed Jun 10 20:00:15 2015 UTC,Sure. Let me work up some pictures over the weekend.
Fencing,39bk09,K_S_ON,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:16:40 2015 UTC,Oh Yeah and I definitely would like to see those plans too.
Fencing,39bk09,TheCourtJester77,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:30:14 2015 UTC,Count me in as well if you don't mind. Would really appreciate it whole heartedly.
Fencing,39bk09,K_S_ON,1 point,Sat Jun 13 02:30:55 2015 UTC,"Wow,  you're absolutely right.  I do have a decent coach.  I just can't afford a lot of time with him right now.  So I was hoping for some good internet advice to keep me going till I can get more coaching."
Fencing,39bk09,robotreader,2,Wed Jun 10 20:13:29 2015 UTC,What does your coach say about your bladework?
Fencing,39bk09,hardwaregeek,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:16:54 2015 UTC,He corrects my beats as being too large but other than that not much.
Fencing,39bk09,white_light-king,3,Thu Jun 11 01:28:48 2015 UTC,"Slow down and focus on making smaller movements, and focus on starting your motion from the tip of the blade."
Fencing,39bk09,Darth_Dread,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:41:36 2015 UTC,From the tip of the blade.  Okay that makes sense.
Fencing,39bk09,Darth_Dread,3,Wed Jun 10 18:31:07 2015 UTC,"What kind of blade are you using? If you're using a Vniti with a heavy guard, your blade work is going to be limited. Maybe talk to your coach about rebalancing your weapon.   Practice doing target practice with just your index finger and thumb. Those two fingers should do the majority of the movement. Blade work is fast when it's efficient and well timed. By the time you see your opponents attack, most likely it's too late to parry. Instead, study the pre-signals that come with attacking. Maybe your opponent tenses up, or he does a certain blade action, etc."
Fencing,39bk09,killerfencer,2,Wed Jun 10 21:07:09 2015 UTC,What weapon?
Fencing,39a6ao,Speirs101,10,Wed Jun 10 10:37:39 2015 UTC,"TL;DR: -YES-  Longer Answer:  Many fencers seem oblivious to piste positioning.  Perhaps it is because most lessons and coaches work only on the linear distance between you and your opponent.  But your lateral positioning on the piste can make a huge difference on the timing, distance and success of actions.  I have watched a high (national) level fencer destroy his own confidence because he was unaware of his piste positioning.  A was fencing on the right side of the piste, his opponent, B, also fencing on his own right side.  So there was about a meter of lateral distance between them plus the linear distance (i.e. regular fencing distance).  A would fleche to deep 4 target and B was catching him with a parry-4 riposte.  I watched 5 of these.  In the break, I told A to fence the other side of the piste. His very next action: same fleche, same target, but this time he was faster than the parry and scored a hit.  As the period continued, he went back to his old positioning on the right side of the piste -- and -- the fleche didn't work again.  So how you going to use positioning to get through your opponent's defense?   I don't know.  But I can tell you, its a good thing you are thinking about it.  Start experimenting.  In training try using the extreme sides of the piste and find out how it works for you.  However, be cautions that you don't become dependent on cheap hits.  Keep innovating during practice so you have a bag of tricks available when you need them."
Fencing,39a6ao,Darth_Dread,7,Wed Jun 10 14:19:06 2015 UTC,"Just to add on to this, here are some other points:   You can line up based on their favourite parry. If they like 4 and you want to avoid it, line up to their outside. Or if you want to remise through their parry, line up on the side opposite from their blade. If they like their 8-6 combintations, see if lining up away from their blade makes them reach for your blade. If your opponent is hitting you with counter-attacks, lining up to either side might throw off their accuracy. Also lining up away from their blade might cause them to reach... if they are reaching draw the counter with a feint and then bind their blade and drive it home. You can almost always line up toe-to-toe. Since this is how most people drill in their lessons, know that you're probably most accurate lining up toe-to-toe."
Fencing,39a6ao,trueflipmode,2,Wed Jun 10 15:21:10 2015 UTC,"If they like 4 and you want to avoid it, line up to their outside.   Ooh, I can think of several people I will be trying this with!"
Fencing,39a6ao,ScallopOolong,2,Wed Jun 10 17:15:59 2015 UTC,Right on! Report back with your findings. :)
Fencing,39a6ao,trueflipmode,2,Wed Jun 10 17:57:52 2015 UTC,"First trial, in practice, was interesting. I liked it. Guy joined me on the edge, mostly. I think it made it harder for him to set up ""attack me in 4"" traps. It also seemed to make it harder for him to fleche the way he likes, ending up off strip so fast. Of course I stepped off strip a couple times during retreats. I was trying to stick right on the edge, but my back foot tends to drift side to side a lot.  Thanks for the idea!"
Fencing,39a6ao,ScallopOolong,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:28:52 2015 UTC,Excellent! Glad you were able to pick up a couple things!
Fencing,39a6ao,trueflipmode,3,Thu Jun 11 20:43:06 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your response, I will definitely try something along these lines at my next session."
Fencing,39a6ao,ScallopOolong,3,Wed Jun 10 14:32:32 2015 UTC,"More a little story than an answer: A few weeks ago I fenced a leftie I had never met before. In my experience fencers in a left-vs-right handed bout tend to hug the outside edge. But this guy was hugging his inside strip-edge. It seemed bizarre and confused me. I thought surely I should be able to take advantage of this by attacking to his seemingly-open outside. I tried twice and he picked off my arm on the inside. I threw out that idea and began fencing more toe-to-toe, and did a lot better."
Fencing,39a6ao,Stencetheboss,2,Wed Jun 10 17:14:36 2015 UTC,"Most definitely, and you don't have to be a high level fencer to use it either.   Story time: I was captain of my high school fencing team and as part of my captains duties I helped coach the JV kids at the JV only events.   (High school JV in my area could range anywhere from worse than a U all the way to C, because if you're not Varsity, you're JV, there is nothing else)  One of our best JV fencers came up to me in the break between her pool bouts and asked me for help against a certain opponent who had trounced our teammate who was in the same pool. Later on the bout starts and my fencer can only double, reason being all the fencer did was close 4 really well and hug her right hand side of the strip, which almost compensated for the fact that she held her arm in the middle of her chest looking like a chicken wing and not keeping it in line with the guard.  My fencer is down 2-4 and all the other girl has done is beat-lunge or jab. I tell my fencer ""move toward the director"" and she immediately noticed the arm, hit it 3 times, and walked away smiling.   Tl;dr: moving around can be even done by amateurs to stellar effect and can reveal previously unnoticed openings"
