That show was pretty much a once off during the Deaf tour.       All kinds of people have toured in Mondo Generator like Brant Bjork, Molly McGuire and some of the guys from The Dwarves. For years now though they've head a consistent line up of Nick on bass and vocals, Hoss on drums and Ian Taylor on guitar. They added a second guitarist more recently.        Nick also has a band (probably more so a solo project really) called Nick Oliveri's Uncontrollable. They're the ones who played before Queens at the Halloween show last year.       Edit: Here's the DVD they released in 2004 when the line up was Nick, Brant, Molly McGuire and Catching. https://youtu.be/nK5YjZ1UH1E       Edit 2: Here's a full in-store show they played on the day of a Queens show in 2003.

qotsa,3e1nzg,adrian1897,3,Tue Jul 21 10:52:39 2015 UTC,"Troy is obviously very good, rarely makes mistakes live (less so than Josh I feel) and has great chemistry with Josh.  Johannes is incredibly good technically and very creative, probably the best guitarist in terms of technical ability.  Josh is QOTSA. Plain and simple, he comes up with awesome riffs, great guitar solos with weird scales and has to sing on top of it as well, he is a modern guitar great. Interestingly, I was once told by a guitar teacher (who is a fan of Josh's) that Mr. Homme has terrible guitar technique but I can't see it myself, can anyone else enlighten me?"
qotsa,3e1nzg,Sam------,4,Tue Jul 21 10:12:24 2015 UTC,"I definitely wouldn't say terrible technique. He has an unconventional way of playing. Have you seen his ""guitar moves"" interview?"

qotsa,3e1nzg,jlight119,3,Tue Jul 21 12:42:56 2015 UTC,"Technical means nothing to me. Technically evolved guitarists, there are hundreds spread across around the world. Guitarists like Joshua Homme are much more difficult to find, He's special, he has the midas touch, it is completely different from everything else. Is Not an idiocy  say Homme is the best, although his first instrument is the battery, he has a sense of rhythm of another planet, only a fool does not realize what I am stating. Speaking of guitarists who passed by the Studios QotSA, all of you are forgetting the extraordinary DEAN WEEN he was a guest on Songs For The Deaf."
qotsa,3e1nzg,adrian1897,2,Tue Jul 21 19:11:27 2015 UTC,"Probably Alain. As Josh once said after an Alain guitar solo, ""that's Alain Sick Fuck Johannes. As you can tell, he didn't get out of his bedroom until he was 18. He's the best guitarist in this band, that's why he plays bass.""        Josh is obviously incredibly creative and has always been the driving force behind the band's sound, but technically I wouldn't say he's at Al's level.       Troy is an incredible guitarist too. Most of the parts he plays live these days are really subtle because there are three guitars now and he does that so well. When he first joined the band and he and Josh were still getting used to each other, it was usually Josh who messed up first when they were playing those crazy improvised leads they used to stick into songs like God is in the Radio.       The only other candidate I can think of is Billy Gibbons, but he only ever played on 3 songs for Queens so it's probably not right to include him."

A slightly censored version of In My Head was given to black box for use in the best Need For Speed game ever about 4/5 months before L2P was released.  They also did this with 3s & 7s and Guitar Hero 3 however that was more of a demo version as the album version of 3s & 7s has a different bridge
qotsa,3dz2ck,Approval_Guy,8,Mon Jul 20 18:17:17 2015 UTC,Eleven is Alain and Natasha's incredibly unknown band. Their five albums are nearly-flawless. I think they're a really solid band to get into.
qotsa,3dz2ck,ColdSoreSuperStar,2,Mon Jul 20 20:15:12 2015 UTC,"Also, I recommend Alain's solo albums. The first one he released a few years back was a wonderful little album that served as a tribute to his Natasha. It contains very delicate and sturdy songs which show what a great songwriter he is.   I haven't got around listening to his newest solo record he released this year, but knowing Al it will be a hoot and a half"

One of the insults hurled was ""faggot"" for which several douchenozzes immediately tried to call him a homophobe (because these Twitter idiots have nothing better to do than to try to read too deeply into the behavior of others) - funny enough his brother is gay (a card he didn't pull, but I think Jesse Hughes slyly mentioned) and no one that knows him thinks he's actually a homophobe.

qotsa,3dlejk,dumpyduluth,2,Sat Jul 18 02:39:23 2015 UTC,"It's far too true. The first album is great. I mean, they were never not pop-rock, but just  the whole context of that album is amazing. The Color and the Shape is a classic rock album with just enough variation to make it last. There's Nothing Left To Lose is where things started to unravel. There are some great songs (""Stacked Actors"") but the edge was starting to dull and the pop was taking over the rock side of their sound. Shortly after this they took a hiatus because the music they were recording sounded like the ""Steely Dan version of Foo Fighters"" as Dave described it (no source, sorry). This is when Dave went to work with QOTSA. Then, One by One was their comeback, and it kicked ass. It was a fresh rock sound, and was clearly quite inspired by QOTSA. From here on out they just dropped off. Wasting Light had some decent moments, and I respect their process for recording it, but overall they lost their impact on me. That's my take, anyway."

qotsa,3dlejk,wovenloaf,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:50:47 2015 UTC,"Joey rushed like the White Rabbit. Solid drummer other than that, but I just couldn't get passed the tempo rushing. The thing that impresses me about Jon is that he plays the parts from the albums exactly as they were recorded. Some may find that uncreative, but I think it shows a lot of professionalism on his part. He will have his chance to play original parts on the next album. Dave and Gene had that on-point, hard-hitting style that I think goes best with Queens. Alfredo was a pretty basic drummer, no complaints but nothing particularly impressive."
qotsa,3dlejk,enough_space,2,Sat Jul 18 03:26:59 2015 UTC,"He did rush, granted.. to me it kinda worked. Like a charging bull."

He also uses microtonal bends and bend up to certain notes from a half step down, with lots of vibrato. He tends to only do the half step bends from D# to E and A# to B. The microtonal bending is what gives it the somewhat middle eastern sound.

qotsa,3cu3la,adrian1897,6,Fri Jul 10 20:39:40 2015 UTC,"Listen to Alain and Natasha's band Eleven as well (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Npsjl2ETsHE). In fact, everything they touch is gold. Read up on their origins too. Both have pretty fascinating life stories. Natasha defected from the Soviet Union with her original band, Black Russian, that featured her, her brother and her first husband. Then in the States, they were signed to Motown (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSidv7-oC3k). Alain was born in Chile. He was in a band with Hillel Slovak, Flea and Jack Irons before the Red Hot Chili Peppers. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJ-K1K8xbFI) He met Jack Irons by punching him in the nuts when they were kids."

Was a fan of the song in my youth and it's not often you hear kazoos in a rock song.   The Bronze - an all time favorite Queens song and a great live version on Live From Bob's Garage. Infinity - Bought the Heavy Metal 2 soundtrack at the time just for this song. Lost my mind when I saw them play it live opening for the Foo Fighters at Roseland in NYC. Era Vulgaris - One of those rare title tracks that doesn't make the album, but an epic song that I was waiting for because I heard that Trent Reznor was a guest, and the song is pretty fuckin' epic.

So much of technology implies or suggests that perfection is something that we can actually attain. Perfection is something to strive for, but certainly not something to expect. And, as it turns out, when music is perfected or corrected it gets a little boring and lifeless.  Because frankly, it’s impossible to do without a computer. But, it sounds wonderful when someone’s holding it together, fighting tooth and nail…and duct tape, just to keep the wings from falling off...as they dive towards the earth… on fire… playing music by the skin of their teeth. And that’s exactly what Grinderman sounds like. They sound like something beautiful, destroying itself.   And isn’t that what we’re really looking for?

qotsa,3cha9x,DaPickle,2,Wed Jul 8 03:50:01 2015 UTC,"Rotoscoping:       Rotoscoping is an animation technique in which animators trace over footage, frame by frame, for use in live-action and animated films.   Originally, recorded live-action film images were projected onto a frosted glass panel and re-drawn by an animator. This projection equipment is called a rotoscope. Although this device was eventually replaced by computers, the process is still referred to as rotoscoping.  In the visual effects industry, the term rotoscoping refers to the technique of manually creating a matte for an element on a live-action plate so it may be composited over another background.

Edit:  Also, if we can count TCV, then I'dd add Warsaw Or The First Breath You Take After You Give Up and Spinning In The Daffodils.  They're both definitely epics."

SELF-FUCKIN'-TITLED: You Can't Quit Me Baby (This and Give the Mule's order should have been switched), Teenage Hand Model (good finale for a kickass album, it's basically of taste of what to expect now and then from QotSA other than desert rock) Rated R: Better Living (epic solo), Headache (epic finale) and In the Fade (the first ""emotional"" song from QotSA, had to be a lot longer), hands down.  Songs for the Deaf: Mosquito Song (one of the best finales in the history of rock), Song for the Deaf (QotSA's darkest). Lullabies: Someone's In The Wolf (best of QotSA imo, just overall amazing), Long Slow Goodbye (the fuckin' horns man, those horns are the definition of epic), Everybody Knows That You're Insane (this and Wolf are the songs that best illustrate Lullabies' theme) Era Vulgaris: Suture Up Your Future, Into The Hollow (both songs that feel out of place within the album, but they still carry powerful meanings.), Fun Machine (definitely into QotSA's top 5 imo). ...Like Clockwork: I Appear Missing, Vampyre and Like Clockwork, no doubt. Three songs that describe the album perfectly. Them Crooked Vultures: Spinning in Daffodils (best of Josh Homme imo, epic finale for an epic album), Warsaw (the instrumental bit is what best illustrates the result of Josh + JPJ + Grohl). Kyuss (all albums): Freedom Run, Supa Scoopa and Mighty Scoop, Spaceship Landing, Whitewater. QotSA's Top 5:   -Someone's In The Wolf  -I Appear Missing  -You Can't Quit Me, Baby  -The Fun Machine Took A Shit And Died  -Everybody Knows That You're Insane"

Context is important--many of these songs are the finales to their albums, and in the case of the end-all be-all in ""Someone's in the Wolf"", it's unarguably the centerpiece of the entire album, with the other near-hour's worth of music being either ""before track 9"" or ""after track 9"".   I do however want to make a special shout out for ""Mosquito Song"" because holy fuck is that song way underrated. Maybe because it's tucked away at the very end of SFTD but I rarely see anyone talk about it and that's a shame, it's a Top Five song for me from the band. Beautiful, beautiful, haunting track."

qotsa,3bzo7s,SirKnightCourtJester,32,Fri Jul 3 23:12:27 2015 UTC,"I THINK I LOST MY HEADACHE (Rated R, 2000)  A killer rock song with a middle-Eastern flair, and yet another demonstration of my best friend’s ability to turn a word and a tune. It’s always good to lose your headache, so this became a favourite of mine on title alone. But beyond that, it’s Queens at their raw finest, and that’s why I love it.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGzT4sCgZxo  THESE AREN’T THE DROIDS YOU’RE LOOKING FOR (Queens of the Stone Age, 1998)  This is one of my favourite Queens songs because it demonstrates Joshua at his hilarious best, and also in rare drug-induced form when he was leading a thousand people to their home in rehab, which is what he does – he’s the Pied Piper of rehab.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGYRAQB6Xuo  I NEVER CAME (Lullabies to Paralyze, 2005)  Lullabies to Paralyze is one of the greatest unsung albums of all-time. It does not get the recognition it deserves, and therefore does not get its proper placement in rock history. That being said, I Never Came is one of the greatest demonstrations of how to be heartbroken, and it’s one of the most emotionally profound songs about what it’s like to be in love in the music business.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eIiu1CjrTE  SOMEONE'S IN THE WOLF (Lullabies to Paralyze, 2005)  I genuinely believe the video to this song is a source of inspiration for the horror film You’re Next (2011). It must be, surely. Watch the film and compare the look of the masks to the look of the masks in the video to Someone’s in the Wolf.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KT60tUIdLfQ  I SAT BY THE OCEAN (…Like Clockwork, 2013)  This is from the latest Queens of the Stone Age album …Like Clockwork. Now, for me, I have a prejudiced viewpoint because I was with Joshua the entire time he was making this album, so I’m able to see it from maybe a different perspective. But whilst I Never Came is one expression of heartbreak in the music business, I Sat By The Ocean is a perfect example of the rage of jealousy that one can experience, especially in our grand circus of rock ‘n’ roll.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oIxgc0t5aw  GO WITH THE FLOW (Songs for the Deaf, 2002)  Next up, from Songs for the Deaf, it’s Go with the Flow. I covered a version of this song myself because I love it so much, because this really is Joshua’s operating anthem. It’s his operating paradigm – relax, just go with the flow. But also, what it really says is that people who go with the flow are cowards, and unless you have something worth dying for, you have no point to live.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcHKOC64KnE  NO ONE KNOWS (Songs for the Deaf, 2002)  This song is also from Songs for the Deaf, and it’s a great song about secrets. If you know anything about the music business, you’ll know that a grand and great career in the music business is often built upon a pyramid of secrets and falsehoods. Remember folks, if at first you don’t succeed, destroy all evidence that you ever tried and kill every fucking witness.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88r_q7oufE  BROKEN BOX (Lullabies to Paralyze, 2005)  This is a testament to wanting to get laid too bad, and not having the box to do it. It’s about a broken ‘you know what’.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekfF1aoLF6E  YOU THINK I AIN’T WORTH A DOLLAR, BUT I FEEL LIKE A MILLIONAIRE (Songs for the Deaf, 2002)  I have very bizarre reasons for loving this song, and it’s mostly because I love the movie XXX (2002), and this song is in the movie. And it’s not just in the movie XXX, it’s in one of the coolest fucking scenes, when Vin Diesel’s taking a walk with the Russian gangster and he’s looking at all the prized, cool classic cars – that’s when this song fucking drops in. And they fucking take it for a gas guzzling fucking ride. Now that’s rock ‘n’ roll.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS8LvHT_zcQ  MEDICATION (Lullabies to Paralyze, 2005)  This song is incredible. Because I’m a drug fiend of the highest order, I understand the concept of medication. So in the spirit of medication... take it!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-YQUCP-J8s  THE VAMPYRE OF TIME AND MEMORY (…Like Clockwork, 2013)  Joshua is a very profound thinker, and when he is able to really dig in to that he comes up with grand insights into the human psyche. I believe in my heart that some of the greatest psychologists and psychiatrists in the world are really just songwriters, because when you listen to a song that speaks to your heart, you’re being counselled whether you know it or not. The Vampyre of Time and Memory is the thing that sucks upon all of us. When your favourite people fade into the fuzziness of old memories and you can’t really see them, you’re being sucked on by that vampire.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEIVlYegHx8  Fuck that website"

But all that aside Josh's tone comes from his fingers and brain, and it really is one of a kind. I've been playing around with that super-boosted low-end Byzantine scale, robot-riff, sexy-as-hell desert cream and it's just never the same as what I hear in that old Queens style.

They broke up.  A few years back the rest of the band Kyuss sans Homme decided to get back together and do a tour.  Homme did not want to be involved but he supported that anyway and didn't want to stop them so he agreed to let them use the name Kyuss as long as they weren't releasing new material with the Kyuss name. If they wanted to release new material he wanted them to use a different name.   The tour was successful. Homme even came and watched them play at a fest.   It went so successful that the other guys decided to make a new album and they wanted to use the Kyuss name.   They also decided they wanted to freeze out Homme since he wasn't involved in the new material. As in freeze him out and legally cut him out of any decisions involving the band named Kyuss.

qotsa,3btzxb,shadybonesranch,6,Thu Jul 2 03:32:49 2015 UTC,This is incredible. I love getting a playlist straight from the man himself. Thanks!  edit: Here's the playlist...   Roky Erickson - It's a Cold Night for Alligators GBH - Time Bomb Old 97's - Timebomb Hot Chocolate - You Sexy Thing Eagles of Death Metal - Secret Plans Brenda Lee - Let's Jump The Broomstick John Lennon - Cold Turkey The Cramps - Human Fly Tame Impala - Elephant Chelsea Wolfe - Mer JD McPherson - Wolf Teeth Cat Power - Werewolf The Misfits - Theme For A Jackal Savages - No Face Grinderman - Heathen Child Brenda Lee - I'm Sorry   Fantastic banter between songs too - and I think he (or someone) is playing live in the studio as a backing track while he talks.
qotsa,3btzxb,noveltynegro,5,Thu Jul 2 04:40:09 2015 UTC,Thanks for the list. Listening made me miss listening to the college radio or other stations late at night when the DJs didn't have to stick to the program director's rotation.   The backing tracks were Desert Sessions songs.

qotsa,3blm91,strictlystickshift,5,Tue Jun 30 05:35:41 2015 UTC,The best we'll get is probably just more guest artist appearances on the studio albums. And I doubt they'd be anything more prominent than backup vocals or bass for a song or two.
qotsa,3blm91,BoobsMadeMeDoIt,3,Tue Jun 30 07:18:49 2015 UTC,"I doubt it. This is the most solid the lineups ever been. Good people, GREAT musicians, all with incredible work ethic and are incredibly reliable to perform well live. I think they're all a bit beyond the stage of screaming your balls off (or in Nick's case, screaming your clothes off?), and Homme is a far superior vocalist compared to Oliveri at this point. Not to knock him, but Homme brought the fucking heat on LC dude. That's not to say he can't play a show here and there or be featured as gust vox on an album, but I don't see him being brought back into the band at all.   I don't see anyone in the band getting replaced unless things really get shaken up. Everything has settled in place and the music can flow freely."
qotsa,3blm91,amouthforwar,2,Wed Jul 1 02:46:54 2015 UTC,"Definitely not. I kind of feel sorry for Nick; ever since he was fired he's been so so eager to get back in, even though it's clear it's not happening."

Iggy is most likely a huge inspiration and influence to Josh, so working with him has to be a huge dream come true (much like if any of us got to work with Josh). I for one am not disappointed, and cannot wait to see what these two are going to come up with.  Part of me thought maybe he was doing something with Les Claypool, seeing as how they did a show together last year or the year before, and the other day QOTSA's instagram posted a picture of Claypool's winery."

The other half of Eagles of Death Metal is working on a secret project, where Hughes eager to tell you all about it, but that should not. ""He'll kill me!""  When the camera and microphones were off, Jesse still succumbed to the charms of Eva. So he told her that Josh Homme is not here at Werchter because he is currently working on the new album by Iggy Pop, of which he is a producer.  Hughes also said that he has tried to get Tim Vanhamel on stage and 'darling' Eve there may be best. See the full interview below."

qotsa,3besta,Gamerhcp,4,Mon Jun 29 13:29:54 2015 UTC,"This is from Josh: “Queens have moved up on my priorities list. Instead of being my drinking buddy it’s become my war buddy. And the guys in the band are more important to me now, too. When they really wanted to make a record, I said, “Okay, if you want to do this, I’m not in the greatest space. You have to start in the confusion and I don’t know where it’s gonna go and you’re not gonna know either.” But that made us so much tighter. We had to trust each other or we’d pick each other apart. I think that had something to do with why we lost [drummer] Joey [Castillo] and had to let him go [during the …Like Clockwork recording sessions]. He had a hard time navigating that uncertainty. Although it was very amicable, it felt like, ‘Damn, why did that have to happen?’ But it brought the rest of us so close together.” Source."

Nirvana, FF, Probot, TCV, it's all played way too safe, which equals boring.    I know I am in the very, very small minority in saying this.  But I'd much rather have Joey or Jon or Alfredo or Gene instead.  Personally I think Dave Grohl is hell of a guy and great songwriter.  He seems down to earth, does amazing projects and puts the fans first (as seen with the broken leg a few weeks ago).  I'm just not a fan of his playing (including guitar work)."

I like that you can put it on, close your eyes and it'll make you feel like you're out in the desert.  Least favorite: Era Vulgaris. It's got a few good tracks, but also a few fairly undwhelming tracks, too. It felt like it could've used some more TLC. In fact, one of my first thoughts upon hearing Like Clockwork was ""this sounds like a much more carefully crafted version of what they were going for on EV."" It's got this sound that's so tight and dry that it almost crumbles like stale cornbread. And on top of it all, I never felt it worked as an album."

qotsa,3bcuyf,Strader69,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:59:46 2015 UTC,"Favourite would have to be either Era Vulgaris or SFTD. Era because its a pretty unique album with songs that all set themselves apart from most of the others. And SFTD because it has a bunch of songs I like and the concept is cool.  As for my least favourite it would have to be Rated R. Feel Good Hit of the Summer feels like a gimmick, Quick and to the Pointless has creepy lyrical content and Tension Head is... Meh. Can't say I'm a fan of Nick's singing as I can say the same thing about Six Shooter from SFTD.  However Rated R does contain some of my absolute favorite's like In the Fade, The Lost Art..., Autopilot, and Better living through Chemistry.  Another contender for least favourite is the debut. Nothing really stands out to be other than The Bronze (which is a bonus/unreleased on the original), Mexicola, and Give the Mule What He Wants."

His last song on Radio 1 was A Song for the Dead. Loads of people don't like him but I think he's a pretty cool dude."

Apple's also going after Dash radio with all of these talk shows hosted by musicians. Apple Music is also super tailored to your taste in music since it's based off Beats Music. Beats Music had this awesome feature where it would give you bubbles with artists names in them and you'd make them bigger depending on how much you liked them and the process would carry on from there.

qotsa,3b2ein,dcoble,6,Thu Jun 25 12:59:54 2015 UTC,"TCV all the way. One of the best albums I've ever heard period. I can never pick a favorite Queens album, but also couldn't tell you if I like TCv more or less. I am a pretty recent fan too... I started 2 years ago. Still haven't stopped listening to Josh at a near constant rate. You've chosen wisely"
qotsa,3b2ein,Wizard-in--Black,3,Thu Jun 25 14:02:52 2015 UTC,Thank you. I just realized I should add them to my artist list on Pandora. Their first song I'm listening too right now is Dead End Friends and I could recognize the similarity.
qotsa,3b2ein,bluntsncuntss,3,Thu Jun 25 14:09:10 2015 UTC,No problem.  Have fun listening.  Josh has created a really incredible back catalogue and there's nothing like exploring his non QOTSA albums for the first time.

Vols. 1 - 8 are out of print and unavailable in any format new.  I recommending keeping a close watch on ebay and discogs to pick up pre owned CDs.  You'll probably need to spend about £10 - £15 per CD for the first four (each Cd has two volumes on it) but it's worth it.  You can still get 9 & 10 with ease on Amazon etc."

qotsa,3b2ein,STEALTHM0UNTAIN,7,Thu Jun 25 16:12:09 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you enjoyed most. If you enjoyed everything after Songs For The Deaf, then you should probably give Them Crooked Vultures a go, if you liked ST and Rated R mostly, then try Kyuss, particularly the album Welcome to Sky Valley. Dessert Sessions 1-6 is mostly early QOTSA-like material with a bit variation, and everything after that is either strange Era Vulgaris-esque or with PJ Harvey :D EODM is almost nothing like QOTSA, it's basically just normal rock with a twist of alternative.  I would personally save Desert Sessions for last, as it reflects QOTSA the most"
qotsa,3b2ein,maxtheshocker,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:48:20 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your input. Honestly, I like all the QotSA albums. I think Era Vulgaris is my top though, a solid fucking album beginning to end, and Songs For The Deaf my least (marginally).   I prefer Josh's lyrics and sick guitars, though I'm under them impression he doesn't contribute lyrically as much on these other albums as he does with QotSA. Or am I wrong?"
qotsa,3b2ein,notactuallyjoshhomme,2,Thu Jun 25 12:58:42 2015 UTC,"I can't say for sure, but a lot of the lyrics on TCV sound like his influence was a lot stronger than Dave Grohl's."
qotsa,3b2ein,damianted,4,Thu Jun 25 15:41:37 2015 UTC,"I'd shoot for Them Crooked Vultures. While they don't sound exactly like QOTSA, they do sound the most similar, especially with Josh on vocals and Dave on drums. The lone album they put out is a masterpiece.  I also love Kyuss. You hear a younger Josh, and only through his guitar. It's much more riff-rock oriented. Personally, I'm not the biggest John Garcia fan (on vox in Kyuss), but he does have some amazing moments.  I haven't really been able to get into EoDM. It's a little too straight forward rock for me. At least what I've heard.  I would also strongly recommend Wellwater Conspiracy. Their album ""Brotherhood of Electric: Operational Directives"" features Josh on a few tracks and they're just all around good."

As a matter of fact, in some interview (I forget where) they were asking about any kind of religious epiphanies after his near death experience, and I remember being impressed that he stated pretty clearly that he had no particular religious feeling. They were kinda angling for some mystical answer from the old Joshmeister, but he was not playing ball.

God, you've got a monster guitar tone figured out...  It should be noted I'm probably vocally influenced by Alex Turner as much as Homme.   Lyrics:    Let’s go down the road together Let’s go watch a witch trial Maybe we will see some bloodshed Maybe we will see some magic  They’re not human And I’m not watchin’ And you… well, you were never here Give me a place to sleep And I will give you memories I can’t really help you at this point…  Let’s go down the road together Let’s go watch a witch trial Maybe we will see some bloodshed Maybe we will see some magic  They’re not human And I’m not watchin’ And you… well, you were never here Give me a place to sleep And I will give you memories I can’t really help you at this point…  Hoo-ah  (mumbled: [fuck] [turn up the mixer?])  Give me a place to sleep And I will give you memories I can’t really help you at this point…  I’m a fool for age-old lore I don’t really know what for I’m a fool for age-old lore I’m a fool..."

qotsa,3aep5a,IMABIRD,12,Sat Jun 20 02:19:54 2015 UTC,It's just that it will dampen the sound a bit since the wood will resonate less. If you have a cheap guitar do whatever you want just don't do it with a nice guitar since the drop in quality might be quite noticeable.
qotsa,3aep5a,ChicagoToad,2,Sat Jun 20 02:37:20 2015 UTC,What's the best paint to use? I might want to do something like this on my cheap fender

Other than that, the Live from the Basement (for qotsa and TCV), the 3voor12 acoustic sesh, and Belfort 2005 (they opened with Lost Art and Headache, how the fuck can you not love that? Also best No  One Knows performance EVER)  I think my favorite like time-frame for the band was around Lullabies though, every performance they did with that lineup was like they were out to fuckin' trample over the world, throw it in reverse and run everyone over again."

qotsa,3a1t2h,odaal,3,Tue Jun 16 15:53:19 2015 UTC,"As I said on the EODM sub: I don't really take it as being the lead single. I think it's just the first thing to put out to make people aware a new record is happening. Also, Josh has 50% or more input on what songs make the album, get released etc. so it's silly to put it all on Jesse. If Josh didnt think this was an EODM song it wouldn't be on the record, wouldn't be released as a single etc. In fact my guess would be that Jesse was good with Complexity just being a Boots song but Josh really felt it made a great EODM track and more people should hear it. Just my .02 from someone who knows these guys a bit."

It was only one song per album, DS wasnt that popular, it was almost underground Music, and we didnt have to wait 7years to a new Queens album, its always about 2 years, except LC, but theres no DS songs.

I've listened to the ""hit songs"" of QOTSA since the band's inception; the crowd favorites have always been on my playlists off and on. But I was always more drawn to what I had thought to be their masterpiece, Mosquito Song. To me it was moody, spacious and rich in subtle details. I thought it was head and shoulders above most things on my playlists.  When I first listened to the new album, I didn't get it straight away. Certainly ... Like Clockwork the song and Vampyre of Time and Memory are easy songs to get hooked on. To me they were new renditions of the same cloth that Mosquito Song was cut from. But once I was hooked, especially after I discovered the brilliant work of Boneface in I Appear Missing video, and the story behind the song, I was firmly on the QOTSA bandwagon. This was nearly a year ago, and I still listen to a few songs from that album nearly every day.   Also, I absolutely agree with you that this album has broadened and certainly improved my taste in music; in that I'm much more receptive to different sounding works, and specifically to Josh Homme's whole repertoire."

There are only 2 or 3 great songs on the album, which for most bands would be fantastic, but not QOTSA... I get that bands change and it alienates some of their oldest fans (like me, who's been around since the beginning), but it's insulting to put a bunch of filler on your first album in six years."

Sing the verse + chorus as you are,chop out the guitar interludes, and when you come back to the chorus again, sing it an octave higher to make it more gripping."
qotsa,39xu1i,liamjpeth,3,Mon Jun 15 20:29:35 2015 UTC,"I think singing an octave higher is not the solution because it will kill the attitude.  But he is right that you need an extra move there on chorus.  Maybe some extra guitars which can get the chorus wider, some slide guitars or a melody. Backing vocals do the job a lil, it just needs a little push :)  This is what I think. I really liked it. I can listen to it with a better mix and mastering."

Obviously Josh isn't a singer like Cobain or Frank Black with all the screaming, but I did read, and believe, that people are gripped by a song when the singer goes for notes they might not make.

They have performed this song on several programs, including The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and Late Night with Conan O'Brien.  A cover of Marvin Gaye's ""Mercy Mercy Me"" was recorded as a B-side and features Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam sharing vocals with Julian Casablancas, while Josh Homme (of Queens of the Stone Age, Them Crooked Vultures and Eagles of Death Metal) plays drums alongside Fabrizio Moretti.  When the song was released as a single, The Strokes launched Operation You Only Live Once prompting all of their fans to call and request the single on radio stations. Their goal was to try to get out the word of the new single as fast as possible, by spreading the song by word of mouth. The Strokes Myspace page asked all users to put the song in their profile in an attempt to spread the single among the online community.

qotsa,39svgk,Sam------,7,Sun Jun 14 13:46:45 2015 UTC,I hear the Floyd in it so I can answer. I think it's when the guitar riff starts. There is a lot of long drawn out notes with enough reverb to make it sound like you're in some sort of space tunnel. Not dissimilar from some of the Dark side of the moon stuff.

He was depressed for months.   One day his wife told him to go in the studio and write a song, and he came up with Vampyre. He said it was shit, no one would want to hear it, etc and she said ""Who gives a shit? It's a song you wrote about what you're dealing with. Who cares who likes it if it means something to you?"" And now it's one of the best songs ever recorded (imo)"

qotsa,39svgk,ninger6,2,Mon Jun 15 05:18:50 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's coincidence the band chose an image inspired by vampyre of time and memory for LC's album cover.   I think this song is probably the heart and soul of the album. Its probably the most blatant with is message and every song on that album fits like a glove on the album.  Even on its own its a great song. The band kills it live and I think it shows that qotsa has significant range. Having a less intense song like this in the middle of the set is a nice change of pace from the full throttle nature most of their other songs have. I hope they continue to play this one live, cause they really do a fantastic job."

qotsa,39igpd,8641975320,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:41:20 2015 UTC,It looks like he's using his forefinger to hit a B note and then playing an E7th or 9th with a funk feel.  So he'll do that double hit on the B with his forefinger and then shift his forefinger up to the A string 7th fret for an E root and playing the chord.  Then for that turn around he will put his forefinger back on the B while playing  that same E 7th or 9th so it becomes an e7th or 9th with a B root and then step down through a scale (so B A G or something like that)

Fatso Jetson (Mario Lalli from Desert Sessions) Hello=Fire (Dean's solo project) Sweethead (Troy's band) Dead Weather (Dean + Alisson Mosshart and Jack White) Eagles of Death Metal (Josh + Jesse Hughes) Mini Mansions (Mike's band) Mondo Generator (Nick's band)   Note that some of these bands don't exactly sound like QotSA but they all have a bit of it."
qotsa,39caf7,ColdSoreSuperStar,4,Thu Jun 11 02:20:47 2015 UTC,"There are no bands ""like"" QOTSA. One of a kind sound IMO. I find myself digging deep into past/current band members previous bands and checking them out. Can never go wrong with Kyuss and Eagles of Death Metal though."

Its Josh Homme on vocals and guitar, Dave Grohl on drums and, the John Paul Jones on bass guitar. Im kind of anticipating a new album in 2016 from them as well."

qotsa,39chkr,dannydorito,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:11:22 2015 UTC,"Because to actually be able to play in C standard the way you're supposed to you need high gauge strings and an extra guitar. Tuning up and down too many times will curve the neck because of the difference in tension. Also, you should calibrate the bridge and adjust the neck's tension too. Basically, just have a guitar set up exclusively for C standard."

qotsa,38wlhw,PoorGuyThatManJohnT,19,Sun Jun 7 13:18:34 2015 UTC,"I've waited so long for this one. This is my analysis:  Spinning in Daffodils is a fucking masterpiece, from the blissful piano intro, which slowly morphs into a crooked, creaky distorted sound. You realize something's about to get real bad.  Then the drums come pounding in, that's it, you're fucked.  The main riff begins, spinning out of control.  Once, out in the rain. I was able to strangle my shadow, unshackle the chain...  The shadowy tone, the sorrowful voice, the obscure lyrics. It all makes you think this narrator either fucked up beyond his own imagination or something terrible happened to him. But anyways, there's nothing he can do now.  Holes, they need to be filled...  Something appears missing (ba-dum tss), but before we can give it any thought, the chorus comes crashing in.  SPINNING IN THE DAFFODILS  The way the chorus interrups the spinning sensation of the main riff feels like a brief change in direction.  DIZZY FROM A THOUSAND TWIRLS  After the chorus, a creepy, screeching guitar blurts out some notes, but it feels disorganized, out of place.  Cold...alone and alive...  We're into the third verse.  You're afraid but that's not what I asked...wanna go for a ride?  The lyrics become creepier, like he's talking to someone, maybe a prisoner. Or maybe he's just hallucinating and talking to himself.  After the thrid verse, we hear a couple more muttered words, like the narrator doesn't even know what he's saying.  Fail...as big as a whale...  Like a canine that chases a bone that's tied to it's tail  Now we can assume he did fuck up. Also, note the animal references, not just this song, but the whole album.  I wish I was a beautiful balloon...I could rise up above of it all and fade out of view...  As this line comes to an end, the narrator barely makes out the last words.  Gracefully fade...fade out of view...what have you turned me into...?  Another theory pops in. The narrator might be talking about unrequited love.  After another chorus, the instrumental begins. We can hear the narrator's gibberish as the drums drive the song, with a bunch of little fills and a thousand crashing cymbals. The riff starts becoming more and more distorted.  What have you gone...and done...my love...? Incinerated in the morning sun.  We can safely assume there's someone else, someone important.  Seconds later, we hit the climax. Everything stops for less than a second, and then the song explodes back at a faster pace, in a most impressive turnaround.  The drums go insane, multiple guitars screech the same new riff.  High...so high...I just...may...never come down...  We hear the narrator's final words, like he has just realized something. His mind is numb, he truly doesn't give a fuck anymore because he knows he's too high up in his own despair.  As the incredible climax goes on, we start hearing a new sound, a wailing slide guitar. The rest of the band fades out, as if it doesn't matter anymore. Soon, the wail is all we can hear. The bass is the last to fade.  After a brief moment, the band comes back. But it's not the same. The slide guitar continues it's wail over what sounds like a very slow polka. The narrator must be now laughing like a lunatic.  I just...may...never come down...  The final words echo in the distance. And soon enough, it's over.  Sorry for the tremendously long comment but I just had to make a full analysis for this one. Final score: 11/10. Seven and a half minutes of pure fucking musical greatness. TCV's best song, by far."

I might not even bother 'stepping down' for a new QOTSA record.... so long as Troy keeps running his smart mouth  Sincerely though, I think the song is about Josh (or maybe one\all of the others) moving to a new place musically and its written as though he were talking to another musician.  The first verse seems to be about breaking free from a musical typecast with a caution that you can't play ""god in the garden"" (create new styles \ sounds) and be ""King of the zoo"" - feels like he's saying that one can't be constrained to the monotony of a style (king) and play the music that your soul wants (god). The god music will lead you away from the zoo music.... Kyuss->QOTSA->TCV-?? ""Holes that need to be filled... working hard to get out of them"" - music needs to evolve and other muso's are too scared to leave the zoo  The second verse seems somewhat similar. ""Come alone and alive... why not go for a ride"" is an invitation to forget about the shit (whatever baggage that's holding you back) and play something new. ""Sharpen your teeth... take one scalp at a time"" - play your shit, push aside the ""hand"" holding you back and win people over (for want of a better term)  The third verse reads like 'never mind the fans' speech. I think ultimately though, it implies that, where one fan ends, another begins... other people will like your shit. The ""fade out of view"" stuff is another play at musical freedom, rising above it all to play without expectation.  The chorus is a reference to being in a happy place ""Spinning in the Daffodils"" - happily bounding through the meadow Sound of Music style... this is a reference to playing the 'god music' ""Dizzy from a dozen twirls"" - excepting this track, of course, there are 12 songs on the album (might be a bit too literal). The dizziness is the euphoria from playing this music  The outro is just an affirmation... things a pretty dandy up here and I ain'ts comin' backs   On a side note, this drums on this song live is pure euphoria."

qotsa,38wlhw,goshdangittoheck,7,Sun Jun 7 17:12:16 2015 UTC,Poor Troy. He doesn't get nearly enough credit.
qotsa,38wlhw,notactuallyjoshhomme,9,Mon Jun 8 01:05:45 2015 UTC,"Sick fucking song. One of my favourite album-closers of all time. The intro is awesome. Beautiful and melodic, and then a juggernaut of a guitar riff. My favourite single moment of the album is when the guitar comes in after the ""what have you done"" part at about 4:50. The lyrics are also fucking perfect. ""Cold/Alone and alive"", man that part never fails to give me chills. ""Take a finger and if the hand feeds you shit/Take one scalp at a time."" Good shit, man. 10/10"
qotsa,38wlhw,adrian1897,7,Sun Jun 7 14:24:22 2015 UTC,"This is a masterpiece. I never really listen to TCV any more apart from this song. Check out the Mark Lanegan song ""Never Come Down"" to hear where Josh borrowed the outro from: https://youtu.be/_B-_Y1Dh0_8"
qotsa,38wlhw,goshdangittoheck,7,Sun Jun 7 15:18:55 2015 UTC,"Easily the scariest TCV song and up there in Homme's entries discography. Freaking fantastic. It's kind of hard to explain the feeling I get from this song. Like, even though you're stuck in a cosmic horror story, you look like you're peachy keen and cool as heck. (Spinning in the daffodils.) Don't mess with the narrator, he will wreck your life. Yeah. 13/10."
qotsa,38wlhw,Wizard-in--Black,5,Sun Jun 7 17:10:34 2015 UTC,"For me this one represents everything that's so great about TCV.  It's big, it's nasty, and it's very badass.  Josh referred to the longer tracks on the album as ""battleships"" and that couldn't be more apt on a track like this."
qotsa,38wlhw,2tidesaday,5,Sun Jun 7 16:48:12 2015 UTC,"I absolutely love this song. It is truly a masterpiece.  I've done an instrumental cover of it before and its really simple but still perfect.  Love the subtle key changes and the layering of sounds.  Now I've never done heroin or any drugs for that matter, but I remember the first time the outro came in with the swelling sliding parts and my entire body shook with chills and it felt like I was on drugs.    Looks like I'll be listening to some TCV today..."
qotsa,38wlhw,crocodome,5,Sun Jun 7 16:17:12 2015 UTC,"Possibly my favorite Homme song. I have always thought that this song was about a guy struggling with dual personalities. One happy personality is represented by the light and delicate piano work, the dark personality being represented by the heavy repetitive riff. Also, in this live version, Josh uses a voice modulator that echoes his high pitched voice in a deep, demonic voice.  A very cool effect and a must-listen.   The opening line ""Once, out in the rain.. I was able to strangle my shadow, unshackle the chain."" That to me sounds like he was able to beat his mental instability once, but that it has since come back.   ""You're afraid, but that's not what I asked... wanna go for a ride?"" Something about that just seems like a madman talking to a frightened captive.  ""I wish I was a beautiful balloon. I would rise up above it all and fade out of view."" To me, that sounds like the mentally ill individual has a brief moment of clarity and realizes he is sick and wishes he could just break free of it all and be detached from it.  I would love to hear other people's thoughts on my interpretation. It was interesting to see all of these other interpretations that other users posted."
qotsa,38wlhw,PenniesAreUseless,3,Mon Jun 8 00:40:06 2015 UTC,"I doubt that's straight up what Homme was going for, but that's a pretty cool way to a look at."
qotsa,38wlhw,Curnbabs,5,Mon Jun 8 01:14:05 2015 UTC,"Bass track is insane. I love how Homme's not afraid to make these weird seven-minute coke binge tracks that take you all over the place.   Love the outro. I find myself singing ""I juuuuuust maaaaay never come down"" while I do laundry every now and then."

qotsa,38wlhw,KingGeorgeTheCurious,3,Sun Jun 7 19:49:40 2015 UTC,That performance is disgustingly good!
qotsa,38wlhw,MacWin-,3,Mon Jun 8 18:53:42 2015 UTC,Feels like the rest of the album and its about a zoo. I get the feeling of an animal locked in a cage imagining the world it used to have and picturing itself being free from captivity.
qotsa,38wlhw,MacWin-,3,Sun Jun 7 22:12:06 2015 UTC,"I'm so glad to see this today since I literally listened to this album last night and since then have a new potential interpretation of it.   This one was my favorite from the TCV and the ending always gave me chills. It would get stuck in my head and I'd find myself questioning the meaning of the song (as I do with most songs). Well one day it just hit me. I asked myself ""Why, if the narrator is so ""high"", does this sound like a dark, sad, aggressive, going insane type of song?"". The answer: the narrator is literally, physically high from drugs as a means to escape his troubles. In fact he's so high that he ""just may never come down"". This is suggesting that he may have overdosed. Personally, I think he DID overdose and I think HE was a real person. Why? Who? You know that PSYCHEDELIC SLIDE GUITAR at the end of the song? Well you see there was this famous guitarist who used to play psychedelic slide guitar. He heavily influenced Josh Homme and also died of drug use. His name was Jimi Hendrix."

For so long I saw only wrong But now to remind It's a waste of time  Seems like he is saying he was depressed, seeing only the negative side of things, until he realized it was pointless to always be negative.   Hours, days left behind Of wasted, useless Selfless, none of a kind  He is realizing that he is wasted so much of his life being negative.   And then after the second chorus: That has drained my life so low   Again, referencing how his life was drained by being negative. But that's just how I interpret the lyrics."
qotsa,38qxuz,UniformRecon,4,Sat Jun 6 02:55:02 2015 UTC,"If rated r is ""yay drugs"" in the fade is the song you are looking for. In the fade is the sobering up and realizing holy shit my life is trash, the fghots comes back on to go yay I am high again"

I mean, obviously this is my opinion and I by no means wanna disrespect the fact you like them, but to me they're just so... Meh. Put it this way, I don't think they'd have gotten the success they have today if their album came out 10-15 years ago. They just seem so average to me"
qotsa,38m33b,lovemeorrageme,5,Fri Jun 5 18:53:27 2015 UTC,"No disrespect taken at all! Everyone has their own opinion. I do really dig their sound a lot, but as far as success you're not far off with your statement. There hasn't really been any new rock bands that make people be like ""wow this is pretty damn good"", not for me at least. RB came around and they can rock and they can rock well, so compared to the shit that's been emerging nowadays they seem like this insanely good band. But what I do think, and this is where we might disagree, is that if they stay consistent from after this album they can be the future of rock n' roll."
qotsa,38m33b,WillWhite,2,Fri Jun 5 21:01:25 2015 UTC,I think they're a good band with some good songs but I don't think they have enough depth to them to make them stick. They are amazing live though!
qotsa,38m33b,The_Kitten_Mittons,4,Fri Jun 5 19:43:13 2015 UTC,"Agreed, one of my favourite albums of last year. They were phenomenal live as well. Couldn't fathom how a 2 piece band could make so much noise."
qotsa,38m33b,ericplaysbass,18,Fri Jun 5 09:02:21 2015 UTC,"What would happen if we mixed two incredible bands and one not-so-good band?  Just another rock band.  Now, before you light the torches and grab the pitchforks, don't get me wrong. I like Royal Blood. I enjoy their tunes when I hear them. Hell, I was front row and center seeing them in Detroit last summer, and then went to see them again several months later. They were both great shows. I met Mike and Ben. I dig it.  But, they're not the ""saving grace of r 'n' r"" (and neither is/was Dave Grohl, bless his soul) and they're honestly nothing original (bass and drums bands have been around since way before DFA1979 perfected the art in the early 2000s).  My biggest gripe with Royal Blood is that even though they do something drastically different with two guys, they still make it sound just as if it were all three. There is no studio trickery, I know, but the engineered sound and output sounds no different from a three-piece to me (and believe me, I know how the sound works. I stared at Mike's pedal board for a good few minutes figuring it out when I was front row last year).  I've gotten really tired of people pointing to Royal Blood and acting like rock and roll is finally saved. It never needed any saving, and it was never dead. We have plenty of great rock and blues acts hiding out there: Alabama Shakes, Benjamin Booker, Gary Clark Jr, Failure (reunion whoo!), Cage the Elephant, Dead Sara, Earthless, Biblical, and so on and so forth. And, there are tons of bass + drums power duos out there, too! I even made a guide for those [that still needs a lot of updating].  tl;dr Tired of seeing Royal Blood plugged over and over again like it's the most amazing thing since Zeppelin. It's not, even if Page met up with them in a totally-not-a-PR-stunt way and praised them. They're good lads and make digestible rock music, but nothing nearly as cutting edge as QOTSA did/does and The White Stripes did (Muse was never cutting edge, unfortunately)."

It's just that I can't go a day without someone going, ""Hey, ever hear Royal Blood? They're so amazing!"" etc.   As for Muse, I do think they had two solid albums with Origin of Symmetry and Absolution, but again, I'd rather listen to some other bands that do the whole alternative rock thing far better with infinitely less cheese. Radiohead, Spiritualized,  Failure again,  Hum, Grandaddy, Pinback, and many more come to mind as experimental rock groups with a real body and soul to their releases. It's been all downhill and infinitely more commercial for Muse since Black Holes. Don't even get me started on the new singles for the upcoming release."

qotsa,38fdxg,crocodome,12,Wed Jun 3 21:12:12 2015 UTC,You generally have to use very heavy gauge strings to play in c. My advice is something sturdy and long. Short scale will give too much looseness to already flappy strings. I used a hammer double cut away les Paul for my drop c guitar and it worked well on a budget. You can pick up a copy of the ovation ultra gp1-s that used to be josh'go to axe. They are made by Eastwood and go for around 800 bucks. A lot of metal players play in those tunings or lower so check out guitars say Korn or any other silly band like that would use. I'm done pooping now so I'm done with my post too. Gl.

qotsa,38fdxg,auntiewarhol,1 point,Thu Jun 4 13:36:22 2015 UTC,Homme used a few different guitars in the early days of Kyuss including a BC Rich Warlock (no really) and a Les Paul.
qotsa,38fdxg,Sam------,2,Thu Jun 4 14:50:32 2015 UTC,"What becomes a problem with tuning down with some guitars is that they become harder to intonate. I tune to D standard and my SG handles it fine, but my strat will never be properly intonated."
qotsa,38fdxg,wovenloaf,1 point,Thu Jun 4 02:20:28 2015 UTC,"The real answer to your question is a baritone guitar, as they are designed to be tuned to Bb by default which is only a half step off from C standard compared to E standard being 2 whole steps above. Any guitar can be tuned down to C with varying results, but baritones have longer necks to keep string tension high for lower tunings which in turn leads to better intonation.   Problem is not many baritones are made these days, but Gretsch, ESP, and Ibanez offer ones that I know of.   Personally I elected to have a baritone conversation neck made for me by Warmoth for an old strat I had and couldn't be happier."
qotsa,38fdxg,vincientjames,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:26:26 2015 UTC,"For clarification - Baritones are usually tuned B to b, it could be confusing for people reading your comment because it says B flat. Baritones aren't necessary but are designed for lower voicings, a Gibson style guitar (e.g. SG or LP) will be pretty good because they have humbuckers and set necks (I'm not sure this is that important for coping with heavy strings e.g. .12 gauge but Homme mainly uses set neck guitars such as a the Ovation GP, Maton BB1200, Epiphone Dot and the Motorave Bel Airs)"
qotsa,38fdxg,Sam------,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:39:22 2015 UTC,"Close but Baritones have different tunings depending on the model   ""While no standard tuning has been established for baritone guitars, popular tunings for the instrument are: a perfect fifth (either A D G C E A or Bb Eb Ab Db F Bb), a perfect fourth (B E A D F♯ B), or a major third lower (C F B♭ E♭ G C).... Shorter scale baritones tend to be tuned C-C or B-B, whereas longer ones are typically tuned A-A""   The models I've seen advertised are set up with the perfect fifth example above. By definition a baritone is the best set up for C standard.   But like I said Baritones are pretty scarce so many people make the best with what they can with standard lengths with varying results"
qotsa,38fdxg,vincientjames,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:10:51 2015 UTC,"A well intonated Les Paul with 12's on it will do fine. Josh used a Les Paul Classic whenever his Ovation broke a string or went out of tune, and it sounded killer. PRS guitars stay in tune great at lower tunings, the Clint Lowery or Mark Tremonti models, and especially the new S2 models with the hardtail bridges are amazing guitars in lower tunings."
qotsa,38fdxg,TakemebacktoCali,1 point,Mon Jun 8 02:39:19 2015 UTC,"It's not just scale length of a guitar, but how you have that guitar set up and intonated. Any good shop will be able to do it in a pinch, and with a bit of research on guitar set ups, intonation and string gauge, you'll find a way to make it work. Basically, though: put new strings on and tune to C standard, don't droptune a guitar set up for E."

qotsa,38fdxg,JackSheet,2,Thu Jun 4 08:02:13 2015 UTC,"Homme bought a few Matons in 2002 when he met Brody Dalle but they were the Mastersound models (played in Eb for the Sky is Fallin and played in the No One Knows video) which I think were solid body.  Homme used a blue BB1200 (called Betty Blue I believe) for a few songs in C standard on the L2P tour and that was semi hollow (look up ...Headache live at Eurokennes 2005).  He started using the BB1200JH (tobacco sunburst) more in 2007 till 2011 for songs in C such as Mexicola .  He uses the Motoravenue Bel Aires now for most songs really (at least one in C, at least one in E) and they're semi hollow or hollow.  While he has used hollow bodies for years, most people associate the Queens guitar tone with the Ovation GP he used to play and the Ampegs he used to play through"

qotsa,3898sn,bizdog,2,Wed Jun 3 20:55:07 2015 UTC,"Unlike QotSA, all Kyuss albums (with the possible exception of Wretch) are somewhat similar. They also lack a theme.   Note that I haven't really studied Kyuss as I have QotSA so I might be a little off, but I think you should start with Welcome to Sky Valley. It doesn't sound as polished as And The Circus Leaves Town, but it's a good summary of the band as a whole. Blues for the Red Sun is heavier, considered by many the best, and Wretch is the most raw, in both sound and musical technique.  Also remember, this is STONER rock, so there's a lot of jamming, specially in the longer songs."

qotsa,38178s,ItsFromMars,24,Mon Jun 1 02:38:44 2015 UTC,"Well, let's see.   The first record is the most consistent one, maybe too consistent. All the songs share the same desert rock sound.  Rated R is nothing like the first one. The sound is heavier, there are very different songs and it is the only QotSA album to lack a ""theme"" to it. Like concept albums, but less complex.  Songs for the Deaf is regarded as the best QotSA has to offer. It's certainly the heaviest, it's theme is dark and gritty, and it has fucking Dave Grohl and Mark Lanegan on it along with a bunch of amazing musicians.  Lullabies to Paralyze (my personal favourite) might be not as heavy as SftD, but because of it's dark fairy-tale theme, it achieves a consistency that's harder to find in the other albums. It's also the first record since the first one not to include Nick Oliveri. Oliveri's influence in QotSA's previous work is defined by some as what marked the ""golden era"" of QotSA. Personally, I disagree.  Next up is Era Vulgaris. Not as dark as the previous records, having instead a raw, robotic feeling to it. Some songs, such as Make It Wit Chu and Into the Hollow might sound out of place, and Run, Pig, Run sounds like it would fit better in Lullabies, but it's still a great record, the last one you should study if you're only getting into QotSA. Then comes ...Like Clockwork.  There is a lot more to the ""QotSA Universe"" (bands such as Them Crooked Vultures, Eagles of Death Metal and the Desert Sessions project) so if you definitely like the band, I'm pretty sure you'll like the rest.  Rock on."
qotsa,38178s,ColdSoreSuperStar,3,Mon Jun 1 04:07:37 2015 UTC,"I don't think any of us will be able to top this. Kudos.   This is about as accurate of a synopsis of the Queens discography that you'll get, OP. Each album really does have a different feel to it, so I would say give each one a glaze over once and then go back and revisit them depending on what your mood is."
qotsa,38178s,thewisefoolHHH,10,Tue Jun 2 04:27:52 2015 UTC,"Probably their most accessible album is Songs for the Deaf, though it's quite different from ...Like Clockwork. That's the good and bad thing about QOTSA is that they don't sound completely the same on any two albums. So yeah, I'd say start with Songs for the Deaf, then check out Lullabies to Paralyze & Rated R, and then the rest of their discography from there"
qotsa,38178s,napp22,1 point,Mon Jun 1 03:40:37 2015 UTC,I was also going to suggest starting with SftD and then working either way from there but probably forward then back.

qotsa,38178s,pine_apples,5,Mon Jun 1 03:19:39 2015 UTC,"Seconded. While none of their albums sounds the same, there is a progression to them. The transition between albums will be less harsh if you do them in (reverse) order. And don't be worried if it takes you a while to get into an album. Every time they put out something new it takes a while for it to click with me."

qotsa,38178s,smokebreak,3,Mon Jun 1 12:35:47 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Except when I went back to their self titled album, it became my favourite. Main point is: QOTSA have no bad albums"

qotsa,38178s,papabrain,3,Mon Jun 1 18:51:02 2015 UTC,"As you can see with the replies here, favorites of and progression through the discography greatly vary for QotSA fans.  The best way to approach what you want to listen to next would be to let us know which tracks on ...Like Clockwork you dig the most. Then, we'd be in a better place to give advice.  But personally, I'd say go with Rated R. It has a soft/heavy balance similar to ...Like Clockwork, and feels similarly raw. The rawness is different, less emotional. Rated R's highs are more manic, and the lows are more jammy, but yeah, you'll see."
qotsa,38178s,jarvispeen,2,Mon Jun 1 08:53:50 2015 UTC,Start from the beginning. Get the self titled album first then go from there.

qotsa,37yb84,Futdashukup,2,Sun May 31 20:29:13 2015 UTC,"I said this a couple weeks ago in a thread for that particular performance and since this is the song discussion.  This performance is a huge part of me first becoming a QotSA fan.  I didn't know them very well then but I didn't really like them because back in 2002 when I was 9-10 the clip for No One Knows weirded me out and I also had terrible taste.  Then in 2007 Sick Sick Sick came on one of the music channels and I dug it. Some time after that my mother was watching The Henry Rollins Show or at least had it on in the background while I was sitting at the computer and they started playing this. At the time I thought it was ridiculous how long they spent jamming at the start but I sat and watched it.  Over the next couple years while I discovered more and more of their stuff I watched this video so many times that it's also my favourite performance and the song is still one of my favourites too.  Now they're my favourite band. And that, kids, is How I Met Queens of the Stone Age."
qotsa,37yb84,Count_Critic,6,Mon Jun 1 14:14:14 2015 UTC,"Love the filthy synth and how awkwardly it lands on the first note when the drums come in. Love the scratching, never heard anything like it. That 'doot-doot' baseline is so simple yet so powerful and then Josh's guitar comes in playing the same thing and it's like OOOF! The melodies are weird and make you work to appreciate them which makes this song a reward and increases the longevity of enjoyment listening to it. It's so slick baby, it's a sin."
qotsa,37yb84,makeamesslioness,7,Sun May 31 20:47:05 2015 UTC,"Those distorted guitars and muted strings at the beginning get me so amped. I really didn't like it the first time I heard it, but now it's easily one of my favorites off Era Vulgaris."

It's kind of it's own subgenre of music. I think that it shows that being groovy as fuck doesn't mean that it can't be heavy. Lyrically and tonally is so different from anything I've heard, and I just think that it could find it's place and it will certainly stick out as one of the more experimental and interesting albums save for maybe LC. The other albums to me are just rock albums. fucking KILLER rock albums that I LOVE, but EV is just different. It has a lot of issues though, and I wish I could do almost a directors cut type thing to trim fat away (....COUGHBATTERY ACID)"

I'm a big fan of adding atmosphere when I'm listening to albums purely for listening, and I'd REALLY recommend just taking some drives through a city area at night while you're listening to it. The first time that album really hit me was driving out of Portland after seeing them live for the LC tour. I had it on because they hadn't really played anything from it, and as I drove further from the city and the lights dimmed, the album started turning from a party rock mix into something mellower and darker. I could haven't timed it any better, but it was the coolest fucking thing."

I also had a similar experience with LTP, with an Appalachian sunset during a road trip when it came out.  I don't think EV is bad by any means, but it's hard for me to imagine it overshadowing the others.  Honestly we are both probably wrong and SFTD will be the one that ends up in the books haha."
qotsa,37875k,Sabres00,2,Mon May 25 21:57:52 2015 UTC,It seems like the albums that I don't like at first and give a few more chances are the ones that end up standing the test of time.  EV is one of those experimental albums that isn't just noise or trying to be different just for the sake of it.  There's so much going on in each of those songs that it's amazing that it's that cohesive. Great album.

qotsa,37875k,99SoulsUp,16,Wed May 27 01:20:32 2015 UTC,"It's a polka song. The first style of guitar Josh learnt was polka.   NB. I read that in an interview, so take it with a pinch of salt.  Oh, and Spiders and Vingeraoons is the most beautiful desert guitar..."
qotsa,37875k,LLWhy,6,Mon May 25 18:14:09 2015 UTC,I actually think Spiders is a pretty cool song.

There's a version of the song from the SFTD sessions with Dr. G on drums. It's pretty killer, being all garag-y and unfinished.   I guess all I'm trying to say is that Little Sister is no ""Let's write a swimming pool in 5 minutes""-type of song. But as I said: Maybe that makes it worse for you! ;)  Edit: just in case someone doesnt feel like googling: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0b7aNB4nQFI"
qotsa,37875k,triangle366,1 point,Mon May 25 20:48:05 2015 UTC,I loved the version of Little Sister they did on the last tour with the extended intro.   I hear ya though.
qotsa,37875k,rudeboyrasta420,13,Tue May 26 15:02:28 2015 UTC,Liking like clockwork is a popular opinion and this thread proves it. I personally thought it was pretty average.
qotsa,37875k,rdrumms15,3,Tue May 26 02:18:03 2015 UTC,Heard that. Right when I got into it I was like 'daaaayum cut me off some more plz.' Now it's probably my least favorite. Still good but my least favorite.
qotsa,37875k,gsmccabe,6,Tue May 26 01:29:55 2015 UTC,"Era Vulgaris and their self titled are their best albums because they contain the weirdest, and most original stuff Josh has written. You won't find any other band doing anything close to These Aren't The Droids.., Hispanic Impressions, Turnin' On The Screw or Run Pig Run."
qotsa,37875k,dankyflam,11,Thu May 28 22:57:26 2015 UTC,The newer albums would have been better if they had used a variety of singers like in the first three albums. Lullaby doesn't count.
qotsa,37875k,sparna,6,Tue May 26 02:52:06 2015 UTC,Jon Theodore is the best drummer they've ever had by far.

Still probably could have been handled better though.  Suing your childhood friend for reforming your old band seems kind of harsh."
qotsa,37875k,Danni_California,5,Tue May 26 12:27:06 2015 UTC,"Look up the court papers, my friend was saying the same thing about how Josh was being an ass but then I showed him the court papers which tell the real deal about some sketch stuff going behind the backs of homme and reeder....to go behind the backs of youre childhood friends so they dont get paid....thats pretty rough, give credit where credit is due man!"
qotsa,37875k,makeamesslioness,9,Tue May 26 12:42:51 2015 UTC,"I believe his reasoning was Kyuss has a legacy, if you wanna get together and make music, go for it, but don't slap the Kyuss name on it when it's clearly much different."

Year later, I like it a lot more, I appear missing and Vampyre of Time and Memory are awesome.   Same happened with self titled, until I really gave Mexicola a listen. Now I love it.   Before that, I only could listen to LTP and SFTD"
qotsa,37875k,UGoBoom,16,Tue Jun 2 22:59:21 2015 UTC,"I think Rated R is one of their weakest records. I think it has some of their best songs (Leg of Lamb, Better Living Through Chemistry, In the Fade), some overrated but catchy singles (Feel Good Hit, Auto Pilot), and also a lot of stupid garbage (Quick and to the Pointless, Lightning Song, Tension Head, and honestly I Think I Lost My Headache is hard to get through).  I think the only album I dislike more is Lullabies, and that's due to many of the same reasons. I even think Era Vulgaris is more consistent and more interesting than Rated R.  Just for reference, I think the 3 strongest records they put out are the Self-Titled, SFTD and Like Clockwork."

qotsa,37875k,Windupferrari,1 point,Tue May 26 05:35:39 2015 UTC,I'm the same way. I can't tell you the last time I listened to the track in its entirety.
qotsa,37875k,UGoBoom,1 point,Thu May 28 06:01:51 2015 UTC,I read somewhere on this sub that the ending was deliberately maddening in order to wake those who tried to fall asleep to the album. What a dick move :)  I just edited out everything past 3:36 on that song and saved the rest. Same with all the bullshit on the SFTD album.
qotsa,37875k,House_of_Suns,5,Tue Jun 2 15:29:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, my biggest gripe with R is it seems to not really have a signature sound like the other albums. I feel like the others have their own feel but R just isn't as QOTSA for some reason. Though like you said it has some of their best songs."

The long intro and outro to ITILMH, the intro to The Sky is Fallin', the trailing off parts of If I Had a Tail and My God is the Sun, all the radio stuff on SFTD. I guess that makes me a heretic, but I'm the type that fixates on one or two or three songs and listens to them over and over for a few days (or more... I've got 2882 plays on my 2:51 edit of Headache, which I made less than a year ago) and I don't want to waste a lot of time on concept stuff.

Conversely, I've listened to SFTD, LTP, EV and ...LC maybe 40-80 times each and love them.  *In The Fade comes close but I hate the way the outro suddenly dissolves into a reprise of Feel Good Hit, it totally ruins the vibe the song had built up."
qotsa,37875k,Alseid,23,Wed May 27 03:27:34 2015 UTC,"Like Clockwork is their worst album: most of the songs like I Appear Missing, My God Is The Sun, and Vampire Of Time and Memories suck big time.  Songs For The Deaf has some great songs but is extremely overrated.  The self titled album makes the rest of their discography (sans Rated R) look terrible.  The raw, robotic sound of the earlier work is the best thing they'll ever do. The way the newer music is arranged in comparison to the older method is generic and boring. Their decline in quality between albums is very comparable to The Strokes."

It doesn't really feel like a queens song to me because it's missing the groove, the bite, the fun and the grittiness that I associate with qotsa.

qotsa,37875k,toodrunktoocare,2,Tue May 26 06:17:17 2015 UTC,"Thats because its a Desert Sessions track. So its not reaaaaally a Queens song.  It does have some Queens elements, but overall - totally different band. Think of it as a cover and its alright."

Generally I like the songs from those desert sessions and thing they sound very much like qotsa songs. That does explain why it's a bit off for me though, it also wouldn't bother me as much but they play it live a fair bit so and it's always been one of their more popular songs.

I don't have any in mind but I also get group-ons for services like that. Search print to canvas and you should find some site that can help. Keep in mind that's only if the image is large enough

I respect their integrity to not play covers. Not to hype them up too much or anything, but I feel like that band has a bright future. I left the show feeling like I had just witnessed a moment. The beginnings of a band I might not get to see at a club again."

qotsa,373f94,andintroducingzylex,5,Sun May 24 17:34:51 2015 UTC,"First QotSA song I ever really connected with. That riff is just so nasty. Then the way the song just pounds the beat into your skull always feels like the classic Queens style to me. The song wraps up with a solo that's a perfect example of Josh's weirdly lyrical lead playing.  I've never been a huge fan of Lullabies, at least when compared to their other albums, but I always go back to it for this track."
qotsa,373f94,Wizard-in--Black,6,Sun May 24 20:44:56 2015 UTC,"Doesn't sound anything like No One Knows to me.  Not even remotely similar.  Anyway, extremely underrated sound off an extremely underrated albums.  Love the ""shit"" half way through.  So badass."

But the riff is short and nasty (in a good way), and whilethe lyrics might not be super deep and poetic, I find them fitting and the delivery is good. Great song to rock out to in the car."
qotsa,373f94,ruinedoverout,6,Sun May 24 16:32:50 2015 UTC,"Excellent. If it's being compared to No One Knows, the correct wording is that NOK is a shittier version of Tangled Up in Plaid. That guitar, the falsetto, bluntly honest and heartbreaking lyrics, nothing I'd change about it. It and Wolfy were my first two standouts from Lullabies (which is my favorite Queens album)."

qotsa,373f94,Kyro4,4,Tue May 26 20:04:45 2015 UTC,"Obviously I can't speak for Josh, but I see it as Everybody Knows that You're Insane as being his fight with himself over kicking Nock out of the band (Nick's insane, he's got to go), Tangled up in Plaid is him actually confronting Nick and how he feels doing it (justifying it with ""you've got to be free""), and then Burn the Witch is the fallout from everyone else who was pissed he did it, without really considering his perspective or the truth as he saw it (""There they are/The mob, it cries for blood""). I think part of that was from how they're all in order on the record and so it felt like they were connected like that."

qotsa,372ggx,matthalius,2,Sun May 24 23:57:24 2015 UTC,"Uhh, the song you linked actually took strong influence from Muse, specifically Stockholm Syndrome. I'd say Dream Theater sounds more like Muse rather than Muse sounding like DT"

qotsa,36g1j6,Hedrigall,10,Tue May 19 02:38:15 2015 UTC,"TCV have a sound I haven't seen replicated- it's not progressive rock but they've got more layering, changing tempos and time signatures, more technicality and a darker sound than other rock albums.  Give Triggerfinger a go. More QOTSA than TCV, but they rock hard. This song got me into them, or rather, their performance opening with it at Lowlands.  Try The Kills. It's just a guitar (sometime two), two voices and a drum machine, though, so it's more garage rock than TCV at times, while still a different league to The Black Keys/White Stripes though.  Maybe try The Dead Weather or Blood Red Shoes, but they're both quite bluesy."
qotsa,36g1j6,grabacr31770,2,Tue May 19 12:10:52 2015 UTC,Blood Red Shoes is magic
qotsa,36g1j6,CaptainUnderrated,8,Wed May 20 09:22:46 2015 UTC,Well these arent necessarily Them Crooked Vultures/Queens type bands but stilll great.  Radiohead's The Bends / OK Computer albums Tame Impala's Innerspeaker / Lonerism Rush
qotsa,36g1j6,SensoryOverloadBand,2,Tue May 19 03:28:09 2015 UTC,Thanks! I like Radiohead. I'll check out Tame Impala next!

qotsa,36g1j6,CeleryDistraction,4,Tue May 19 19:29:19 2015 UTC,"The killers album Sam's Town might a good one for you to check out.  Brandon Flowers vocal style I think is in the range your looking for. It's not as heavy as them crooked vultures but it definitely still jams.   This river is wild, for reasons unknown and bling would be good songs to check out if you just wanted a sample.   Edit: also if your a big fan of royal blood you would probably like Death From Above 1979 a fair bit. Your a woman, I'm a machine is my favourite album of theirs and it's a short (~35 mins) but fantastic listen."
qotsa,36g1j6,burnt0ast,5,Tue May 19 03:33:48 2015 UTC,Oh thanks! I actually really like Sam's Town but I've hated everything The Killers have done since.  I'll check out Death From Above 1979!
qotsa,36g1j6,Sam------,3,Tue May 19 03:43:07 2015 UTC,"I would 2nd muse,  only some of their songs will fit your niche but the folks over at r/muse  love  QOTSA and  I'm sure  the  love TCV. Both bands hit hard and are catchy.   Led Zeppelin should to some extent fall in since John Paul Jones is in TCV."

This band is a bit  different but I love them,  Incubus (way more so their early work ) their  3rd album Make Yourself,  and 4th Morning View might interest you I similarities to Muse and  QOTSA. Their 2nd album is a tippy, funk, metal, rap, combo that doesn't reflect the band's overall sound but  definitely their best work."

As for bands like TCV, I had a scroll through my music library and I'm really struggling to find anyone similar.  You might like Interpol if you like Muse and Blur, but I can't think of anything to cover the Homme side of things."

I didn't know them very well then but I didn't really like them because back in 2002 when I was 9-10 the clip for No One Knows weirded me out and I also had terrible taste.  Then in 2007 Sick Sick Sick came on one of the music channels and I dug it. Some time after that my mother was watching The Henry Rollins Show or at least had it on in the background while I was sitting at the computer and they started playing this. At the time I thought it was ridiculous how long they spent jamming at the start but I sat and watched it.  Over the next couple years while I discovered more and more of their stuff I watched this video so many times that it's also my favourite performance and the song is still one of my favourites too.  Now they're my favourite band. And that, kids, is How I Met Queens of the Stone Age."

qotsa,35z6n6,gsmccabe,6,Thu May 14 23:52:16 2015 UTC,It was certainly spur of the moment on Will Ferrell's part. Josh isn't pissed at all though; that's just his face. I think he was actually super happy to have it happen. He just had a legendary SNL cast member join him on stage to recreate one of the most significant and lasting parts of one of the most significant lasting segments in SNL history. Who would be pissed about that? And it's not like Will was intentionally off tempo; he was pretty much right on time.
qotsa,35z6n6,ericplaysbass,7,Fri May 15 00:21:17 2015 UTC,"It was certainly spur of the moment on Will Ferrell's part   Yea, they probably had the same wig & outfit just laying around backstage for half a decade in case Ferrell ever came back to host & needed them for a spur of the moment cowbelling with the musical guests (/s)  Seriously though, isn't Josh like widely known as one of the funniest guys in rock n roll? Asking Ferrell to do this seems very much in Homme's wheel-house (and I can't imagine Will Ferrell doing this without knowing it'd be cool with the band beforehand)"
qotsa,35z6n6,Gonzzzo,6,Fri May 15 01:43:33 2015 UTC,This SNL gig was done around the same time that Homme did a  tsunami relief benefit show in Los Angeles that had a bunch of people including Will Ferrell on stage.  Like you said I'm pretty sure they were all quite chummy at this time.
qotsa,35z6n6,ramubis,2,Fri May 15 02:07:05 2015 UTC,I meant that I'm sure Josh didn't know it was going to happen. Of course Will Ferrell did; he planned it in advance. It was spur of the moment for QOTSA. Just look at Josh's face when Will comes out.
qotsa,35z6n6,ericplaysbass,3,Fri May 15 02:48:03 2015 UTC,"It'd be a bit of a dick-move for Ferrell to just do that in the middle of a live-television song without clearing it with the band first...that's half my point   Just look at Josh's face when Will comes out.   He doesn't look pissed and/or surprised to me...IMHO his eyes & facial expressions become more animated like he's playing along with a bit that he's been waiting for...  Which is more likely? Will Ferrell saying ""oh, QOTSA is performing a song that's perfect for my cowbell thing.""...or QOTSA/Homme saying ""oh, we're performing a song that'd be perfect for Will Ferrell's cowbell thing""  I dunno either way, but Will Ferrell doesn't seem like the egotistical type. And somebody here just told me that QOTSA had performed at a benefit/charity along with Ferrell shortly before this episode of SNL"

qotsa,35kp4m,waltons91,9,Mon May 11 07:42:54 2015 UTC,"There's no such thing as a fully complete EV CD, unfortunately.  The 2 disc tour editions come closest as they feature most of the B sides but every version (there were a few, all with slightly different tracklistings) is missing one or two songs.  I have the European and Canadian tour editions as well as the UK standard edition and between them I have everything recorded in the EV sessions apart from their cover of Goin' Out West.  Basically, if you want everything you are going to need to buy the album multiple times and sniff out some rare and normally very expensive versions of the album.  You can also try and get all the CD singles that feature covers and remixes on the B sides but that would be even harder and more expensive as the majority of the singles from that era are long out of print.  TL;DR: There is no complete EV release, you will need to buy the album about 4 times to get everything, if you want all the B sides, Covers, and Remixes."

qotsa,35hjxm,strictlystickshift,12,Sun May 10 14:56:04 2015 UTC,"I have been waiting. Queens' best song without a doubt, IMO one of the songs ever written. Lanegan could not have done a better job; he killed it on the vocals. Vulnerable but somewhat proud, resigned yet hopeful. The trippy, slow-jam vibe of the intro up through when the drums come in is incredible, perfectly describing the attitude of the lyrics it conveys. Then we have Nick's beast of a bassline and the sick-ass guitar riff backing Josh's lilting back-up to Mark's howling ""I know"". Chilling, hauntingly beautiful in its simplicity. Everything meshes together in a way that you can't help but fall into the groove and ride it out with the goofiest fucking grin on your face. All in all, 10 out of 10. Amazing song on all counts. Bra-fucking-vo."

Bittersweet maybe.  For me this is one of the perfect Queens songs."

qotsa,35hjxm,amouthforwar,3,Sun May 10 22:51:50 2015 UTC,One of my favorites. When I saw them for the first time in Oct '13 in Dallas I told my wife before the show that my mind would be blown if they played In the Fade. They played it about half way through the show and my mind was indeed blown. Best concert I have ever seen hands down.
qotsa,35hjxm,ruinedoverout,2,Mon May 11 03:58:25 2015 UTC,"I love this song, but then again, I love all QOTSA songs, haha. It's not close to my favorite QOTSA song, personally, but that's a pretty high bar. Lanegan does a fantastic job with the vocals, like he always does. He also co-wrote the song, which is definitely interesting when you consider its lyrics. Pretty sure it's   They don't know,  I'd never do you any good   then   Ain't gonna worry   I can't tell if Lanegan sings ""Just live till you die"" then carries the ""i"" sound into ""wanna drown"" or if it's meant to be a separate ""i"" sound from ""die"" to ""I wanna drown"" that he just didn't take a break/breath between. That one might not matter either way. The Genius lyrics page for this song also has some cool ideas about the lyrics:  http://genius.com/Queens-of-the-stone-age-in-the-fade-lyrics/"
qotsa,35hjxm,theaksy,2,Mon May 11 13:17:11 2015 UTC,"Also one of my all time faves. Theres something about it, maybe the chord progression or something, that feels so un-qotsa but its still them in every aspect. Its an amazing song and i fucking love it. Especially live. It was amazing live."

I had bought her a ticket, and instead my buddy went with me. Hearing this song live, really brought out a lot of feelings in me. It was the perfect music to go along with the change in my life. Every part spoke to me in a way they haven't before.   I was very happy when they released the iTunes session and this was on there. The slowed down live version is really powerful.

Forgot about them after that. Then I see they've got another track on guitar hero 3 (3s & 7s) and I start to think this band is great, look them up a bit, realised I recognised Burn the Witch and Lost Art, then I saw they had a new album coming out (...Like Clockwork). I listened to My God is the Sun and thought it fucking sucked (I love it now, don't worry). As hope faded for the Queens I saw their 15 minute trailer for ...Like Clockwork and fell in love with I Appear Missing and boneface's artwork. Then I looked at Homme's other bands and realised I'd already heard TCV from other video games I played (Skate 3, Gran Turismo 5) and thought they were great.

(I was a teenager just getting into metal so queens didnt fit my tastes.) I downloaded a discography to get those two songs. A few years later i got hooked on This lullaby and the blood is love. Then maybe a year after that i was listening to my ipod for the 10 hour ride back to alberta for work, When Misfit love started playing. Immediately fell in love with the song and switched it to only play queens. Every song sounded so good, like my brain was having multiple orgasms.   It blew me away that i had this tresure trove of great music on my ipod for years and i didnt know it. Then i listened to them for months on end. Four years later im still loving them and finding new parts of songs i love. (The drum solo in Avon, the change in misfit love.)   Now with spotify i have access to the deluxe edition of Rated R and haven't stopped listening to Born to Hula and Never, Say Never."

It was a bit of a departure from what I was used to, especially with how alt-y ""I Sat By the Ocean"" was two tracks in, but I grew to dig it. ""Keep Your Eyes Peeled"" pretty much got my from the get-go, though. Such contrast between those first two songs.

And every day I would find new cool QotSA songs and added them to my playlist. Until ...Like Clockwork was announced and I checked out the teasers just to be sure. The artwork and the music blew my fucking mind. That's when I instantly got all the albums and crammed them inside my head. Then did the same, but with Desert Sessions, then TCV, then Kyuss...and the list goes on. After all, I ended up almost exclusively to Josh Homme/QotSA related music. Weird."

March 14, 2014. Nine Inch Nails, Queens of the Stone Age, and Brody opening.   QOTSA won the coin flip so they started and let me tell you, that whole concert fucking blew my mind. I had been listening to NIN for about 9 years by then, but QOtSA/Kyuss was more Dad's thing, I just never managed to get introduced until that concert.   I teared up over Vampyre, my jaw probably dropped a couple of times from various songs and by the end of A Song for the Dead I was actually worried they had out done NIN before they even came on. I just didn't want it to end. (NIN is a whole other beast live and you can't compare them both so I won't and it was so amazing the rest of the night too). But damn, I could have gone a few more rounds of QOTSA, wish I had money for the second night. But after that I just ripped all Dad's CDs and listened to everything constantly after that.

He said he really didn't like it and offered it to me, I took it being curious. Listened to it on the way home and was sorta impressed, not really blown away. I mostly played Go With the Flow, The Sky is Falling, and Do it Again. I would skip over most everything else.      Flash forward to the Summer of 2003 I went through a terrible breakup with a girlfriend (That i though would be the one or something). I for some reason started listening to that album (SFTD) my friend gave me again. I was hooked, something clicked, I couldn't get enough of it. So, I started seeking everything they had, pleasantly I found there were two previous albums I hadn't heard. Haven't looked back since. Funny how I really didn't like QOTSA at first and now I have everything they have done and everything Josh Homme has touched.  There's an interview with Josh Homme in Spin magazine and this is what he says after being asked about the trouble he had  with the Interscope label he said, ""I want to do something classic. If we do this right, we could actually be someone’s favorite band of all time. That’s fuckin’ rad. How can you beat that shit? Lots of people listen to music on the way to the bank and they don’t think about it anymore and that’s totally fine. But some people listen to a song 60 times in a row. I’m making music for them.""    source for article: http://www.spin.com/2013/06/queens-of-the-stone-age-josh-homme-like-clockwork-interview-2013/"

When I hit high school, I reversed course and thought MTV was lame as fuck and for the most part stopped watching. Then when I was 17 or 18 I remember turning on the TV late at night just to think, ""I wonder what bullshit music they're showing on MTV now, and I switched to MTV just to laugh at something terrible. Right when I switched, they started the video to ""No One Knows."" At the time, I was on a real high horse listening to prog rock and jazz and metal, and I sat, transfixed, prepared to hate it but unable to. The video for that song is terrible, and I watched with skepticism. By the time the guitar solo dropped I was hooked. I didn't catch the name of the band or the song, but I remember really liking it. It stuck in my head as that one MTV band that was actually good.   Later in college, Lullabies to Paralyze came out and somehow it entered the regular rotation in my and my roommate's music collection. My friend came over and we were listening to it, and he asked if he could put on their older stuff. He put on ""No One Knows"" and I instantly recognized it as that MTV song, and listening to it as a college student only made me want more. I've been a mega-fan ever since."

qotsa,356o8f,halfbloodpr1nce,1 point,Sun May 17 01:52:40 2015 UTC,"I love this topic!  Posted this over on thefade.net when this came up a while ago:  September 2002. I was a sophomore in college. I had subscriptions to about three music magazines back then, and everyone was simply over the moon about this Queens of the Stone Age and ""Songs for the Deaf"". I recognized Lanegan and Grohl, and my interest was piqued.   I drove to my local On Cue music store (remember those? They later became Sam Goody's...), grabbed the CD, unwrapped it in my car, slid it into the stereo, and drove home. By the time I got to ""First It Giveth"", I had to pull over to the side of the road and just listen. Then I got to my house, sat in the driveway and listened some more. Walked into my house as if in a trance, stuck it in the stereo and sat down in front of the speakers. I fell and fell HARD for this band at first listen. In the coming months, I immediately picked up R, scavenged for copies of self-titled and Desert Sessions...and listened and listened and listened. My first show was Lollapalooza that next year, but my first ""real"" show was that bizarre Hard Rock Live performance they did for MTV at the Hard Rock Orlando, where JHo spray painted ""QOTSA"" on the giant guitar that was on the stage, and Nick smashed his bass against it trying to bring it down. Needless to say, that didn't make the broadcast.   I've been to five more Queens shows, one TCV, and have met Josh and the band on a number of occasions. Yes, rock stars and celebrities are just people, but it is so rewarding to meet people whose art you love deeply and they are so fucking awesome in person. Josh and Troy are especially talkative and gracious."

qotsa,356o8f,vincientjames,1 point,Thu May 21 03:28:22 2015 UTC,No One Knows video on MTV. I downloaded the song by itself way back in the original Napster days and had it on a mix CD for a couple of years but never picked up an album.  Fast forward a bit and me and a few buddies are remodeling a house that we currently live in and we had a junker boom box and I had just picked up Songs For the Deaf which made for great manual labor music. The album had just the right pacing and never got old. Song for the Dead is a great song for some loud and heavy deconstruction.

Seriously now, I'd kind of feel bad for these guys if they didn't try such a cheap way to produce content. They seem to like what they do and put effort into it, but they fail miserably. The vocals are terrible and I hope this is the only song that has such shitty vocals. The lyrics just don't make a lot of sense, and the sound is poorly mixed."

qotsa,34x0k2,Sam------,3,Tue May 5 07:10:12 2015 UTC,I don't t'feel it was plagiarized. Opening riff is definitely very similar but the rest of the song is different enough. I'm mean the Queen's song is so much better anyways. I also think that throwing the word plagiarism around whenever a song is similar is a slippery slope. We don't need lawyers sticking there noses in art.
qotsa,34x0k2,Dodahevolution,1 point,Tue May 5 15:10:24 2015 UTC,"The opening guitar riff is the same rhythm (exactly) using the SAME intervals (I think) but it is in a different key. The drum beat sounds very similar but I don't think it's the same. The way the two are layered/structured is very similar to that of Millionaire, with the drums playing before the guitar which is before the bass"
qotsa,34x0k2,itsdgc,2,Tue May 5 15:45:01 2015 UTC,"Listen to the desert session version of this song, drum beat is the same"

But I doubt Queens cares enough about a band that's racked up 4,439 in total views of that one song over the past three years. And for what it's worth, everyone probably prefers Millionaire anyways, even the Cannoneers."
qotsa,34x0k2,wovenloaf,2,Tue May 5 19:05:36 2015 UTC,"When did a guitar riff become something you could copyright?  Let's be honest here, yeah its similar, and the rhythm is the same, but you can't copyright a guitar riff. If you could copyright guitar riffs and chord progressions and get a settlement off of every little thing that sounded similar, I'm pretty sure Jimmy Page would be having a Hey-Day going after hard rock bands for copying things from Zeppelin.  Music is music guys. If a song is obviously worse, then why worry?"

qotsa,34prt0,rvlution,6,Sun May 3 14:55:38 2015 UTC,"I would not call this a weaker track at all.  I think it's widely adored by fans. Also I don't think lyrics need to be super deep and insightful to make it a good song. They just need to fit, and after all josh is only saying what he wants to say in this song and nothing more. And I don't see any laziness, sometimes you don't need words you just have to sing the tune"
qotsa,34prt0,rdrumms15,6,Sun May 3 14:41:55 2015 UTC,"Good song, pretty solid. Are the lyrics about public intoxication? I feel like the S/T lyrics are more word salad that the later albums, but that's not bad at all."
qotsa,34prt0,goshdangittoheck,7,Sun May 3 14:31:48 2015 UTC,"Are the lyrics about public intoxication? I feel like the S/T lyrics are more word salad that the later albums, but that's not bad at all.    I've always thought the lyrics of the first album, and this song in particular, have a sort of dystopian/Orwellian vibe to them and show a melancholic outlook on life. ""Free range humans, all cooped up."" ""All those long long days with no escaping."" ""New programmes are coming in. So rise and take your oath."" ""Been programmed as I said before...Technology"" ""Me just happy robot."" ""I'm so lost out on the highway. With no direction left to go. Everyday sit up and wonder. Where it was I started from.""       The melancholia and general feeling of drifting directionless through life make sense to me considering the album was written in the aftermath of Josh breaking up Kyuss, the band he'd been in since he was 14. There was nothing really to indicate this ""Queens of the Stone Age"" thing was going to go anywhere. He had actually given up music and moved to Seattle to go to college after Kyuss broke up. It was only when he met (and temporarily joined) Screaming Trees that he got back into it."
qotsa,34prt0,adrian1897,5,Sun May 3 20:04:43 2015 UTC,"Certainly. I feel like we don't give them enough credit when we, as fans, assume their songs are only about drugs or fucking. Josh was clearly trying to figure out what his place was when he made self titled. The chorus of Regular John, to me, sounds like Josh really just wants that sort of a relationship. ""Open up your up your room, open up your arms"". Saying he's bored with himself and that he'll just hang around really highlight that he'll do anything for something normal.   Saying he's programmed, as you said, lost in crowds, stuck in a jail in Mexico, using repetition to show how sick he is of how his life is. ""it's the same old song again, I hate it cause it's true."" All of his lyrics really spoke to me when I was younger, when we all go through that phase."

qotsa,34prt0,headless_bourgeoisie,5,Sun May 3 23:38:43 2015 UTC,Avon is my #2.  The chord progression during the slide part is just so unique and the next note is always unexpected.  One of their riffs that could just go on forever.  Heard it live once and it was unreal.  Also leads into If Only perfectly.

Gardenia especially gets you in a loop, mainly because there's no good place to stop."
qotsa,34prt0,bmcnult19,2,Wed May 6 10:29:14 2015 UTC,I find Peter Stahl's voice works better for this song than Josh's.  Also the lyrics feel a bit more connected than avon which just seems to be a jumble of sentences.

Avon is a great song to just zone out and drive too, which isn't actually saying much because most queens songs fill this quota-- but even then Avon is a standout. Also I love that short chill solo!"
qotsa,34prt0,CeleryDistraction,2,Sun May 3 22:04:40 2015 UTC,An awesome song but I usually prefer to listen to the one at Glastonbury because Dave's drumming is just that much cooler.

qotsa,34ie0p,smoktimus_prime,6,Fri May 1 22:36:04 2015 UTC,"This just pisses me off. Scott Weiland (and STP) were my hands-down favorite band in the 90s. They shaped my musical taste through my teenage years. I even ran a fairly popular fansite for a couple years, and to see him disrespecting his fans and his past like this... goddamnit. When he was all drugged up, I wished the best for him. I looked up to the guy (musically, at least), and was so proud of him when he finally cleaned up.  Scott has either fallen off the wagon, or has entered 100% don't-give-a-fuck mode.  Either way, it's a disrespect to the music that put him on the map and made him popular enough to try new shit like this. There would have been no Velvet Revolver (at least not with Scott) or Wildabouts if it weren't for STP.  Moreover, it's a giant ""fuck you"" to the HUGE portion of the people who go to these shows wanting to hear old STP and Scott's new stuff."

However, the fact that both the mp3 and wav files that come with the drive seem to be skipping on approximately the same parts of the song leads me to believe that the ""master"" (cd?) that these tracks originate from my be the source of the problem. I'll try contacting the QotSA web store to see if they can help. If not, meh no biggie, that flash drive is still a bundle of cool stuff and I'm glad I bought it."

qotsa,34a26z,Nauje,2,Wed Apr 29 21:42:52 2015 UTC,"I agree Queens never nail No One Knows live, I can't describe why but I think it may be down to the guitar tone feeling off most of the time or Josh's voice not being as smooth as it is in the studio (which is somewhat impossible god I love the studio version) or maybe it's the lack of the oh's in the 2nd verse.

He did apologize profusely for it, and had at least a partial excuse that he had a flu and a major fever that day.  Doesn't excuse it, but his actions after seem to be showing he really meant it.  He did a bit on Portlandia where he played Carrie's Gay Brother.  He also did a song with Elton John on their last album, both of which, to me, seem to show sincerity, it could all be BS though I guess."

It was a really small venue, they were playing the first album and the excitement of it being my first time seeing them. My second favourite was the most recent show. It was outdoors in the middle of the city on a beautiful summer evening. It was just a brilliant setting. Brody Dalle opened for them and rocked. Queens were on absolute top form. Oh and Josh had a conversation with a dog at one point. Third best was the O2 show. Queens were great. Sweethead opened and were really good too. It was my first time seeing songs from Like Clockwork played live. The only downpoint was that I really don't like that venue. The worst (or least good) was without a doubt the first Belfast show. It was in a half-empty ice hockey arena. Everyone there seemed to be 15 and only interested in being seen there and wearing the ""right"" clothes. Josh barely said a word all night apart from something sarcastic after the second last song, Feel Good Hit, finally got the crowd moving. Sweethead opened that night too and I felt sorry for them. They were on really early because some awful local band were playing after them and before Queens. There was only a handful of people in the huge arena when they played."

Before that, I caught them doing a few songs at a radio station with like, 10 people there.   I've seen them in a few 'secret' shows. Once, I waited several hours for a Renegade show.

I loved that they played Fun Machine and I'm Designer in StP because I had those on repeat at the time. Most fun I've ever had at a show. Moshed for the whole encore.

qotsa,347igi,rdrumms15,2,Wed Apr 29 01:47:40 2015 UTC,The solo from better living through chemistry is still a challenge to learn correctly. Also Kalopsia due to the amount of variations hard to me memorize

Hommes falsetto in the start is absolutely brilliant and the guitar solos fit the eerie vibe of the song perfectly. Really dig the lyrics as well actually, one of the best off LC no doubt. Also an amazing experience to see live,  highly recommend!"
qotsa,33wzu9,HelplessHeathen,10,Sun Apr 26 13:08:10 2015 UTC,That middle swell of sounds and notes is so emotional. And then it all just collapses back into the song. Gives me goosebumps every time. One of my absolute favorites.
qotsa,33wzu9,Chriskeyseis,6,Sun Apr 26 15:22:33 2015 UTC,Guitar is Pink Floydish IMO. Definitely a great tune. Not like a lot of their other work though. Like clockwork (the album) is definitely one of their more emotional works. The song itself encapsulates a lot of what Josh was going through at the time.
qotsa,33wzu9,PigeonOfShitMetal22,6,Sun Apr 26 19:01:48 2015 UTC,the chorus riff is excellent
qotsa,33wzu9,strictlystickshift,4,Sun Apr 26 13:23:20 2015 UTC,This song just has me excited to hear more Jon Theodore drum contributions on future releases.

qotsa,33wzu9,Tooth127,5,Sun Apr 26 13:30:14 2015 UTC,"QOTSA teached me to listen to whole albums and view them as one solid piece. There couldn't be anything different for LC to end. It really is something that goes like clockwork here, with no ironic meaning."
qotsa,33wzu9,dankyflam,3,Sun Apr 26 20:27:54 2015 UTC,"Absolutely beautiful song and perfect release from the record.  Those familiar with Jon Theodore's drumming in the Volta were probably surprised by how chill it was, as I was, but that versatility in his playing is what made him such an instantly good fit for the band. Super excited to see what he brings to the table on the next LP."
qotsa,33wzu9,MasterExploderizer,3,Sun Apr 26 16:21:12 2015 UTC,"I actually didn't think much of this song when I first heard it, but after repeated listens, I really started to dig it.

qotsa,33wzu9,theaksy,3,Sun Apr 26 19:14:14 2015 UTC,Lyrically I think it is QOTSA's best song.
qotsa,33wzu9,CeleryDistraction,2,Tue Apr 28 15:27:51 2015 UTC,"This is a great song on its own, but it is an absolutely perfect follow up to I appear missing. It's a fantastic gentle release to close out the album. Like OP mentioned the song is fairly uplifting, despite the lyrics telling the listener otherwise. It's probably a top 3 closer from them IMO. It's interesting because it's a very distinct outlier in there catalogue of songs (vampyre is kinda similar) but having songs that are so different IMO is what makes QOTSA stand out above other bands.   Overall I just really dig this song, it's interesting instrumentally and I think lyrically as well. ""Not everything that goes around/comes back around, you know"" is a killer hook. I love when Homme twists common sayings and changes what they mean completely."

qotsa,33q3a3,tentonbricks,1 point,Fri Apr 24 17:01:54 2015 UTC,"If we're gonna get all philosophical about the possibilities, here's my take:   This line highlights the tendency for jadedness, cynicism, and feelings of tedium or indifference to creep in as you gain more experience. Discovery = newness and novelty, which people are usually excited about. The more ""you've been around,"" the more you have seen, heard, done, and you begin to notice the endless repetitiveness in behavior and recapitulation of ideas; it's not surprising anymore. Similar sentiments: ""if you have to ask, you'll never know"" and ""whatever, newb.""  Although, Florentine-Pogen has a very good point."

qotsa,339nob,KoA07,2,Mon Apr 20 21:30:19 2015 UTC,"I dunno.  I know he uses a few Ovation Ultra GP's, especially on their earlier albums.  Maybe he just found those more to his liking.  Ovation's solidbodies are sweet, though.  Most of them are a little more on the quirky side, though, so they don't get as much love as they should."

qotsa,334d6x,crocodome,7,Sun Apr 19 15:14:19 2015 UTC,"I never really ""got"" this track, or ""Reptiles"", when I first started listening to TCV. They were both just too damn weird. Reptiles with its odd time signature and riff and this song with its... everything. However, after listening to it a handful of times, I have come to realize how beautifully sickening of a song it is. I have heard Homme say in an interview that it's what he thinks the music would be like in the waiting room to Hell, and I totally get that analogy. (As an aside, Homme said Reptiles was like watching a broken robot try to clean your house)   Once I started listening to IWL more, I realized that this song is a song in the same vein of ""You Can't Quit Me Baby"", in that it's about a guy being obsessed with a girl to the point of psychosis. I give the song a 9/10, just for its uniqueness and taboo lyrics."

qotsa,334d6x,notactuallyjoshhomme,5,Sun Apr 19 15:35:56 2015 UTC,"Interlude with Ludes is one of those crazy one offs in Josh's discography.  There's certainly nothing by TCV that sounds like it and even counting all his other bands, there's very little out there that compares with it.  I respect the song for just how different it is, and it's got some great touches to it, such as the way the drums fade in and out of clarity.  I've always thought Josh was on top form lyrically on this album and Ludes is no exception, my favourite line being ""It's so hard to apologise / so I'm just gonna skip it"".  Having said all that, it's not a personal favourite and if I had to order all of TCV's songs by personal preference, this would be somewhere near the bottom.   To be honest, that's more about how good the album is than because I don't like this track, though."

To record I used Reaper with a guitar fx VST plugin (Guitar Rig 5). I then made my own preset effect (Lead 800 cabinet, graphic equaliser and screamer) to get an early qotsa / kyuss sound.  I recorded the guitar tracks (main + solo) on top of a Backing track fo Mexicola I found on youtube. The backing track includes bass, drums and vocals.  Glad you guys like my recording."

qotsa,331sla,adrian1897,10,Sat Apr 18 19:39:57 2015 UTC,"Gonna have to say Rated R.  Why? Because I feel like it lacks a distinctive sound and feel, unlike the other ones (Lullabies and LC being the best examples). I believe all QotSA albums have a certain theme to them, except for Rated R. This isn't necessarily bad, it's just my personal taste.  Don't get me wrong tho, Rated R is a kickass album and it contains amazing stuff."
qotsa,331sla,ColdSoreSuperStar,6,Sat Apr 18 18:51:37 2015 UTC,Rated R feels like a wild party with loads of drugs and every song being a different drug.

I got into Queens by seeing them Live last year, so you can understand the first experience of their music being newer stuff. Fuzzy stuff is great but I never really could listen for too long, although I do enjoy the odd listen of a Kyuss album, my Dad's always been partial to the fuzzy because he's big on the Stoner Rock movement.

But, it lacks the weirdness and aggressiveness that you get on other albums, save for Keep Your Eyes Peeled. It's a good album, but not what I listen to QOTSA for. Also, every other album has had really distinctive production whereas on LC it's just clean and that's about it."
qotsa,331sla,bizdog,2,Sat Apr 18 21:19:06 2015 UTC,"I've put a lot of thought into ranking them, and it's really tight between SFTD and the self-titled. So many point-counterpoints. Like, point: You Can't Quit Me Baby. But counterpoint: Mosquito Song. And it just goes like that forever. Overall I think the bulk of SFTD isn't as strong as the bulk of QOTSA, and that's the difference maker. So, Songs for the Deaf."
qotsa,331sla,ruinedoverout,3,Sun Apr 19 00:03:32 2015 UTC,"Really? Huh. Opinions are opinions, and I respect yours, but SFTD was my first of theirs and I still think it slays from beginning to end."
qotsa,331sla,Psychobilly2175,2,Sun Apr 19 00:41:13 2015 UTC,"Well I mean it's not that it DOESN'T slay from beginning to in, it's just that the songs that aren't standouts (Do It Again, Gonna Leave You, etc) aren't as good as my least favorites from the debut (Regular John, If Only)."
qotsa,331sla,ruinedoverout,1 point,Sun Apr 19 01:50:11 2015 UTC,"That's fair. Some people can't stand the Lightning Song or Auto Pilot, but those are some of my favorites on Rated R. It's almost like people have different tastes or something."

qotsa,331sla,rvlution,5,Fri Apr 24 15:49:16 2015 UTC,I don't think I've listened to Like Clockwork since it came out. I do like it but it doesn't really feel like a Queens album. It's very singer-songwriter. Not a whole lot of guitar riffage.
qotsa,331sla,headless_bourgeoisie,1 point,Sat Apr 18 23:21:44 2015 UTC,"This took me probably half an hour to think of, but Rated R. Don't get me wrong, In the Fade is easily my favourite QotSA song (with Lost Art and Better Living as a close second and third), and in my top 5 all-time songs, but the album as a whole is just... fine. I much prefer the feel of LC, SftD, and Era as albums straight through, and Lullabies and S/T have more songs that I like"
qotsa,331sla,notactuallyjoshhomme,1 point,Sun Apr 19 20:24:14 2015 UTC,"It's really hard for me to say this, but ...Like Clockwork.  It is a fucking incredible album, with some amazing songwriting and some fantastic use of set-pieces, but it isn't QotSA to me.  This album is full of amazing rock tunes, but the more vocal driven nature of it kind of shuts out the riff and layer heavy iterations of the band that I grew to love.  Even though I say it's my least favorite, I still think its the most well-constructed and best overall album since SftD."

qotsa,32pjkp,Ruscombmanor,1 point,Thu Apr 16 02:29:35 2015 UTC,That was actually the thing that inspired the idea.  We like to switch the signature lines to different instruments here and there.  You'd be surprised how often moving a guitar riff to the horns or vice versa sounds totally natural.
qotsa,32o9qt,Renoside,4,Wed Apr 15 11:32:33 2015 UTC,"Sounds like In the Fade so it's probably just open A and 11th fret on the D. So, A + C#, A major. He also hammers on from the 9th fret on the D."

Josh in 2000:    [Chicago Tribune] - By calling yourselves Queens of the Stone Age, are you tweaking the ""stoner rock"" stereotype of the drugged-out band revisiting the '70s?  It definitely is implied. I don't spend my life trying to denounce ""stoner rock,"" I just don't like my music getting dumbed down too much. I know it's not brain surgery, but hopefully it's not like a 30-foot-tall bong, either. There are some good bands under that umbrella. In my case, it really gives me something to mess with, musically speaking. I know there is stuff on this new album that will make people go, ""This isn't stoner rock,"" and I like that idea."

Misfit love is kind of eh, and contrary to popular opinion, I like Battery Acid, Make it Wit Chu is hilarious and 3's and 7's is alright.  But as a whole the album is a little disjointed, the first 4 tracks are so good that the rest of the album just kind of drops off in energy and then I lose interest. I can't even remember the last time I kept the album on past 3's and 7's."

Super snarky, clever and not afraid to be offensive for the hell of it.   Saying ""never again will I repeat myself"" before literally repeating the same thing two lines later has always been one of my favorite parts. Guitar work is also incredible on this one. It really feels like and fits in with Era Vulgaris' sound."

It's a strange song-- shit eating grin producing lyrics, some weird fucking guitar and IMO one of their best hooks.  Queens in general are a pretty unique sounding band but I gotta say I've never heard anything else like ""I'm designer"" and probably never will.

Probably has to do with his surgery and having to get zapped back to life and then losing some of his ability and interest to get into writing and creating again. So something was stolen from him. Some time (three months in the hospital if I recall correctly) and maybe memory means opportunity or the ability to be in love with what he used to do. That's my ten cent response. If you want to hear him really get into what happened, the first time I heard him talk in length about the entire ordeal was on the Mark Maron podcast. You should listen to that, it's pretty powerful stuff."

Besides the obvious pop culture reference to the 1931 film Dracula you could suggest that it is also following the theme of having a close connection to death. Think of Homme as the woman on this cover- Someone who is wrapped around by the embodiment of death. Being seduced by Dracula's charm and embrace, unable or unwanting to escape.   We know that the album itself deals very intensely with Homme's close encounter and the album is one big set up for it. Think of the cover as the short film at the beginning of old Pixar films- The call to mecca telling you to shut the fuck up and pay attention etc.  Nothing is by mistake, everything has a reason for it to be included with the album. I'm about to go to bed so if you need any more help it won't be until the morning.  EDIT: The Dracula on ...LC is actually wearing a skeleton mask."

Would ""I Appear Missing"" be nearly as good of a song without knowing the personal context of it? Would ""Regular John"" be as good if you didn't know that the numbers they chant are Homme's cheating ex girlfriend's number?   Obviously an old prom picture might not hold up to this kind of example, but I think that the people in the band and their lives can be equally important.

qotsa,31zycp,countkahn,2,Mon Apr 13 01:19:38 2015 UTC,I'd say it's Coward's Way Out from Desert Sessions I (not technically QotSA but still Josh Homme).  But if it has to be QotSA it's definitely Mexicola.

qotsa,31rz95,Wizard-in--Black,13,Tue Apr 7 18:29:20 2015 UTC,"Considering the fact that the Foo Fighters are on a world tour right now, and its been confirmed that the Eagles of Death Metal are recording a new album right now, I would say that this is a pretty far reach. Maybe in 2016 we will get new Vultures material recorded and possibly released Q4 2016, but Id say thats also a stretch because the new QOTSA album is set for a 2016 release."
qotsa,31rz95,goshdangittoheck,3,Tue Apr 7 19:18:32 2015 UTC,My hopes were up but now they're squashed on the ground.  Oh well.  Any material is good material.
qotsa,31rz95,Grimson47,1 point,Wed Apr 8 01:00:22 2015 UTC,"While what you're saying is right I think there's a time frame where this could happen. From what I've heard Eagles are almost done with the album and are going to be touring all summer(hopefully with the new stuff) and Josh rarely tours with them. As for Dave, his tour is probably going to be over around August/September. From there till the end of the year there's some time. I'm not expecting a new TCV album in a month or anytime soon but at least a statement like ""Second album under way, be ready!"""

qotsa,31rz95,UniformRecon,7,Tue Apr 7 20:51:16 2015 UTC,"In an interview he did last year, Josh talked about a secret project and I think this may well be it.  Dave has been pretty busy recently but depending on how much spare time he had he might have been able to fit it in his schedule.  Josh hasn't been doing much recently apart from the new EODM album (which he probably won't be touring) and to my knowledge JPJ isn't doing anything either.  I wouldn't bet on a tour this year given all the Foo Fighters shows, but I can definitely see a new album happening.  If it's even half the album it's predecessor is, it'll be a monster!"

It's short, punchy, it has a catchy riff and a memorable chorus.  It's a lot of fun and it's bound to be a blast live.  Having said that, it's certainly no deep cut and there are many QOTSA songs I prefer to this, but it certainly does nothing wrong and it ticks all the boxes for what a single should be.  Basically, it's a lot of fun but certainly not Queens at their best, as I feel is the case with most of their singles."

I waited in line at a guitar store ten years ago to meet Troy on their DFA/QOTSA/NIN tour. He signed my guitar's pickguard, we talked about guitars, and I requested they play Infinity that night. He said he'd talk to the band but because they're doing an opening set and it's a relatively unknown B-side it would be extremely unlikely. Infinity was the third song that night. Thanks Troy, if you're reading this.  I've met Jesse Hughes twice. Once outside of the Commodore in Vancouver, Nov 2008, he was trying to walk around inconspicuously outside the venue in a shiny silver jumpsuit. The moustache gave it away. I ran up and asked if I could snap a quick photo, to which he obliged, but seemed rather surprised that his cover was blown. He immediately took off and slipped back into the venue before anyone else caught on.  The other time was outside of West Edmonton Mall in July 2009. I was wearing my Man's Ruin logo shirt and saw him talking to three babes in the parking lot. I walked up to them and he immediately broke out of the conversation they were having to yell at me ""WHERE THE FUCK DID YOU GET THAT SHIRT?"" We then had a five minute conversation about how he was owed a lot of money following the collapse of Man's Ruin the label, and that as recompense he now owns a warehouse full of Man's Ruin back-stock or something to that effect. Pretty chill dude."

After EODM's Death By Sexy came out, they played at Atomic Records in Milwaukee.  They had kegs brought in and played for like an hour and a half.  Afterwords, Josh, Jesse, Big Hands, and Dave Catching hung around and shot the shit.      Josh and I spoke quite a while about his time in Washington, guitars, and trying to find the right people to start a band with.  He seemed genuinely willing to talk.  That big motherfucker gave me a hug and also signed my buddy's lucky beer pong ball.      I've gotten hammered with Jesse Hughes, who's a fucking riot.

I asked Josh about Slaughterhouse Five, and he said he never read it (Dave said he did a long time ago but didn't really remember anything). I vented on my granfalloon shame/pride in sharing a homestate with Kurt Vonnegut. Josh said I had to own my shame, choke the bitch out until only the pride was left, or I'd always be haunted by it. He went on to talk about the desert and himself as an example. We were pretty drunk, but it still hit home.    We left the pub, and it was early morning or late evening because orange light tinted the half-timbered buildings, but slate colored clouds loomed close over the buildings. I said my thanks, all my fan-freak stuff that it was amazing to meet them both and I apologized to Dave for ignoring him, and then a tornado twisted out of the stone-like clouds, landing a behind the building to our left.  Then I said, Oh, I'm dreaming. I waved and said, Later dudes! and flew the fuck outta there like Superman. The land on other side of the buildings was a lunar landscape with twirling fingers scraping from the clouds to the craters, and I weaved between them until I faded into awareness.  And that's not the only time I've had a dream I met Josh Homme.  edit: what the fuck's up with the downvotes? For fuck's sake, I said it was a dream at the beginning."

I also enjoy The White Stripes(anything Jack White-related), Spoon, The Strokes, Oasis, Pearl Jam, Arctic Monkeys, Foos, Chili Peppers., Radiohead, Tame Impala, Cage the Elephant, Black Keys, LCD Soundsystem, Band of Horses, Interpol, Tool, Nirvana, TV on the Radio, Third Eye Blind, Soundgarden, Pink Floyd, Incubus, Audioslave, Arcade Fire, Kings of Leon.

qotsa,31cp96,pjdwyer30,1 point,Fri Apr 3 23:16:56 2015 UTC,Dave Matthews Band...? How dare you even mention them in the same sentence as Q and Led.
qotsa,31cp96,ilovehelmetsama,1 point,Sun Jun 7 13:12:49 2015 UTC,"because that band members are amazingly talented musicians and improvisers. if you have an issue with the way Dave sings or with his lyrics, that's one thing, but it would be an extremely ignorant thing to say they that they aren't very talented. Tim Reynolds is one of the greatest guitarists to ever grace the earth with his presence and only a fool would say otherwise.  Even after a 20+ year career, they still sell out amphitheaters across the world, have a dedicated following that will see multiple shows across the country each year, and 6 straight #1 albums (no other band has done that, by the way).   I realize it's the cool thing to do these days, so please make fun of DMB all you want. I don't really care. But if you gave them a serious, critical listen you might learn a thing or two. And not studio albums, only live albums."

They have a very unique sound, often compared to the Beatles but way darker. My personal favourite song right now is Fantasy.  Their overall best songs are (in my opinion): Monk, Wündebars, Creeps, Vertigo and Majik Marker. Both albums are solid, the second being a lot more diverse than the first. The only thing I could possibly point out as a flaw is the lack of insightful or deep lyrics in some of their songs. Other than that, they're an amazing band."

qotsa,312t6t,Corrupth,11,Wed Apr 1 16:58:36 2015 UTC,An artist named Rhys Cooper has done some sweet posters  for QOTSA that I always thought would make sick tattoos.

qotsa,312t6t,bp83,6,Wed Apr 1 20:08:45 2015 UTC,"I got this done a year ago. It's unconventional in terms of the art that is all over from their posters and albums, but it remains kind of personal to me. It's a juxtaposition of good and bad. 3's and 7's often associated with lucky numbers. They are also know as lies. Good and bad.  I chose hearts because heart is the symbol of love, and good health and the less subtle oozing/bleeding heart showing the decay of good health and or love.  http://imgur.com/VMAFFp0  So as my best advice, I'd take a favorite song, album art or lyric and try to make up something that showcases your love for QOTSA, but let it resonate with you on an even more personal level!"

qotsa,312t6t,turdbuttpoop,1 point,Wed Apr 1 19:08:40 2015 UTC,"I like it too. I have tattoos. But for me a large part of the appeal is individuality. So when someone asks for help on the internet deciding what to get permanently added to their body it seems like it's removing the individuality/creative aspect.  I'm totally fine with going to friends with an idea and asking if it's a good idea. I'm 100% for asking your tattoo artist what their thoughts are when you go for a consultation. But going online and asking total strangers ""what should I get for a tattoo"" just seems a little strange to me. That's all."
qotsa,312t6t,rapemybones,7,Wed Apr 1 19:16:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know what you mean, but let me put it in this way. I'm looking for a background, something that has to do with QOTSA. When I found one that I think is fitting I'll throw my own motives and ideas into that background and making it more unique and characteristic in a way."
qotsa,312t6t,turdbuttpoop,1 point,Wed Apr 1 20:05:50 2015 UTC,"Go for it then, I don't want my opinion to sway you, just trying to spark a conversation."
qotsa,312t6t,skepticalDragon,2,Thu Apr 2 20:05:42 2015 UTC,"I respect your opinion, so don't take this the wrong way, but not everyone who gets a tattoo is trying to be original and show off individuality. If that's what's in it for you, then fine, you're open to your opinion. But for me personally, getting tats was more about reminding myself of who I am, what is important to me, and if others have the same tat because that's equally as important to them, then even better! We have something in common, usually something deep enough to make them a true friend! It doesn't bother me in the slightest.   So again, you're open to your opinion, but it would be nice if you let OP pursue what he really wishes to pursue without questioning his motives. Perhaps OP even agrees with you, and for all we know none of his friends are Queens or even rock fans, so this might be his way of showing off his individuality like you do with your tats. After all, something that's original to you might be commonplace in another part of the world, and vice-versa.  And maybe OP just needs a spark of inspiration from another redditor to put this image that's in his mind onto paper, and so maybe seeing other people's tats could be really inspiring to him. You never know, everyone's a little different and prioritize things differently."
qotsa,312t6t,gowithetheflowdb,2,Wed Apr 1 21:17:13 2015 UTC,"I understand what you're saying, but I don't agree. I appreciate you taking the time to explain yourself, and I can see what your point of view is, but it doesn't resemble my perspective at all. I'm glad I sparked some conversation here and OP seems more entrenched in his idea, which is good because he's gonna make a permanent decision regarding his/her body art. Everyone goes about getting tattoos in their own way, I don't want to change the you or anyone else's process, just trying to get some perspective from other people."
qotsa,312t6t,SMB73,1 point,Thu Apr 2 20:04:18 2015 UTC,"I agree with you man, I spend a long time thinking about my tattoos. But there's certainly other valid ways to appreciate tattoos."

LC really shows the range that the guys can pull off, and springboards into the other albums really well. If you like the dark songs like Keep Your Eyes Peeled and Kalopsia, try Lullabies to Paralyze next (big hits are Little Sister and In My Head). If you like the big, weird songs like I Appear Missing and Smooth Sailing, go for Era Vulgaris (Sick, Sick, Sick, Misfit Love, and 3's and 7's) and the Self-Titled album (Regular John, Avon, The Bronze). If you like the vibe and energy from songs like Fairweather Friends, I Sat by the Ocean, and My God is the Sun, move onto Songs for the Deaf (No One Knows, Millionaire, Go with the Flow). If you really like the whole album, the range and depth of the songs, you'll like Rated R (In the Fade, Feel Good Hit of the Summer, Lost Art of Keeping a Secret) a lot. I hope this helps, and welcome to the club"

For the most part, you can pick and choose whatever you want but here's a bit about each album:   ...Like Clockwork: Where you started.  It's a lot more emotional than their other albums and is kind of like an alternate universe version of Songs for the Deaf. Era Vulgaris: Definitely the most experimental of the bunch, it takes a while to get into. I like it, it's weird. It's good if you're feeling really angry.  Julian Casablancas sings on ""Sick Sick Sick"" Lullabies to Paralyze: A little slower than the others, and can also take some time to get into. Songs for the Deaf: It's meant to mimic the act of driving through the desert while listening to the radio, so there are parodies of various stations and radio djs.  It's a really freaking coherent, nastygood album. Rated R:  There's a lot of diversity in instrumentation on this one, and it almost seems like a parody of itself, but in a good way.  It's weird and self-aware. Self Titled:  This one could be a little harder, as it's still heavily influenced by Kyuss, Homme's former band.  While a lot of the songs sound identical, it was the next album I got into after ...LC.  It's really heavy and fun.   Hope this helps!"
qotsa,30r0jj,thrasher829,3,Mon Mar 30 01:13:21 2015 UTC,I appreciate you taking the time to write all of that! I'll most definitely delve into Songs for the Deaf next

If you've already gone through like clockwork I would say go into good ol' Songs for the Deaf. Pretty accessible album, all killer no filler. Save albums like Era Vulgaris and (most of) Lullabies to Paralyze for last. They're definitely the strangest of their albums, so it might be good to work your way into it haha."

Lullabies to me is the album that most sounds averaged Queens.  And I don't mean that it's an average album, just that if you averaged all of their stuff it would be closest to that album.  Pretty accessible for a start."
qotsa,30r0jj,GetReady4Action,2,Mon Mar 30 05:15:23 2015 UTC,"Honestly, as someone who got into QOTSA with LC, I thought Era Vulgaris was the most instantaneously memorably album I heard, so it sounds like opinions are pretty diverse. I would say start with Songs for the Deaf and Era Vulgaris since it kind of represents their diversity over their discography."

qotsa,30r0jj,TunaFishy-,2,Mon Mar 30 06:28:59 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying this is the best way, but when I first saw QOTSA with no knowledge of their music, I ripped all of my Dad's copies and listened to EVERYTHING on shuffle, most people will say it's a bad move but I started picking up what I liked, pieced together albums and started listening to the album I thought I liked the most.   Lullabies was my first big interest, then it went to SFTD, ...Like Clockwork and then I just felt my way around after that. ...LC is my most favourite but Rated R is crazy good imo, real mixed bag."
qotsa,30r0jj,Approval_Guy,2,Mon Mar 30 11:47:21 2015 UTC,"Definitely check the popular songs first. Everyone else has named them pretty sufficiently so I won't. There's a reason everyone likes them; they're easy to get into.  But just find songs and play them. If the intro sucks, wait it out. If you really don't like the song or not feeling it, try another. Then possibly go back to that one. Some songs take a few listens to really feel. Depending how technically inclined you are, listening for background guitars or bass riffs or specific lyrics can really make you realize how strangely different their songs are."

qotsa,30r0jj,wovenloaf,1 point,Mon Mar 30 03:01:38 2015 UTC,"The thing about QOTSA is that you never know which song will strike a chord with you.

Instead of listening to separate songs, I would just listen to each album, in order of release. DEFINITELY go with self-titled next."

qotsa,30qa95,BatmanDelMercosur,1 point,Mon Mar 30 13:04:01 2015 UTC,In Des Moines I think 3 years ago they had the audience decide between No One Knows or Song for the Deaf to close out the show and the audience conclusively picked SftD.  Edit: OK I found the DSM set list and they closed with song for the dead. But they did play song for the deaf earlier in the show. And looking at the set list it was a bad ass show. I thought so anyway.  http://www.setlist.fm/setlist/queens-of-the-stone-age/2011/val-air-ballroom-west-des-moines-ia-bd245ba.html

I THINK it's somewhat satrical, but on first listen all I could think of is that it was like a song that a rock band would play in an SNL skit."

qotsa,30fpvu,McNorema,1 point,Sun Mar 29 22:01:10 2015 UTC,"""The Blood is Love"" is one I always respected but only recently really came to fully enjoy. Weirdly enough, ""I Appear Missing"" took me a long time as well--LC was my first QOTSA album and both of the last two tracks kinda lost me. Revisiting it after becoming more of a fan, actually reading the lyrics (I always thought the first line of the chorus was ""Throw me away""), seeing the live version, and learning the story behind it, it pretty quickly became a top ten track for me."
qotsa,30fpvu,kraftwerkd,0,Sat Mar 28 04:35:52 2015 UTC,"Fairweather Friends makes me want to stab someone in the eye. It's fucking horrible and I don't think I'll ever get into it. I've been into QOTSA since day one, and it's the first song I've ever outright despised.   I'm also not a huge fan of ""Run Pig Run."" Someone on the old Rek Rek board said it sounds like Halloween music. But I don't outright loathe it like i do Fairweather Friends. Even the name of that song is fucking stupid and makes me want to kick Josh in the balls."
qotsa,30fpvu,hailingburningbones,3,Fri Mar 27 14:58:12 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I kind of like it, because it shows what happens when desert rock meets Elton John. It's cool as an experiment in blending styles if nothing else."

qotsa,3064ar,univoxs,1 point,Wed Mar 25 02:24:38 2015 UTC,"I have to go with 3's and 7's. I think it's one of the best rock guitar solos recorded in recent memory. 1. It fits the song (something that I find solos don't do a lot) because it's fast and pushes the song, but is also extremely varied, laid back, and (for lack of a better term) janky. 2. It's extremely complicated but simultaneously not busy. 3. It's not too long and not too short."

So captivating; an incredible blend of new and old in terms of styles of rock. It's what I imagine it would sound like if Secret Machines toured as a Beatles cover band and came back to make an original album. The way he lets the guests artists truly own their songs is so so well done, and definitely a departure from how things were done with qotsa. I like it. It's so clearly a Brian Wilson song or an Alex Turner song without slapping you in the face with ""Look who we have behind Door Number Two!"" It just feels so natural.   The production is on point and the creativity of the songwriting keeps me listening to every second of every song. I don't think anything fell flat for me.   Too cool."

Love the music, the musicians, the overall feel and consistency of the album, how all the songs seem to have a similar sound. The only song I don't like that much is Little Sister, because it kind of feels out of place, much like Make It Wit Chu in Era Vulgaris."
qotsa,2zxo49,Faded99,6,Mon Mar 23 00:26:26 2015 UTC,I can't believe it's been 10 years!  Holy shit.  Seems like yesterday me and my friend were listening to it the day it came out.

qotsa,2zxo49,hlainelarkinmk2,5,Sun Mar 22 21:11:33 2015 UTC,"Shows how great a band is if a very good album is their worst, I also think Something's in the wolf is tied for favourite song with A song for the deaf and I appear Missing"
qotsa,2zxo49,LeftoverBun,2,Sun Mar 22 23:31:01 2015 UTC,"This is probably my favorite LP of theirs, though Era Vulgaris is neck-and-neck, depending on my mood.  They really took it to another level after their mainstream/metal 3rd release."
qotsa,2zxo49,little_did_he_kn0w,2,Mon Mar 23 00:25:35 2015 UTC,"My mom bought if for me for Christmas when I was 17, making it my first QUOTSA album. Although it isn't quite as heavy becaue they lost Nick before they made it, it certainly makes up for it with all the weird. A great introduction album because as I listened to all their other records it seemed to just get heavier and better than where I started."
qotsa,2zxo49,headless_bourgeoisie,2,Mon Mar 23 07:50:38 2015 UTC,"Alright, confession time: this is the first QOTSA album I ever listened to (it was streaming on MySpace). I think it's unfairly picked on. I didn't even need to listen to the whole thing before I decided to buy it. Honestly it might be my favorite of theirs (although that could be the nostalgia talking)."

qotsa,2zwd8q,Owzings,12,Tue Mar 24 19:14:19 2015 UTC,"One of their absolute best songs.  The riff is incredible, the bass line is one of Nick's finest and the percussion really adds a lot to the track.  The production is top notch (especially the way everything bar the drums and vocals are faded out at one point) and it's just such a great, experimental song.  The  song also features some lyrics borrowed from Bjork, which is interesting.  You can hear the two seconds side by side here"
qotsa,2zwd8q,Wizard-in--Black,12,Sun Mar 22 15:06:38 2015 UTC,This is my all time favourite bassline of all time.
qotsa,2zwd8q,Curnbabs,3,Sun Mar 22 17:15:56 2015 UTC,Absolutely. It fits the guitar so well by pretty much counteracting it. Josh's melody is amazing as well.
qotsa,2zwd8q,Shakemyears,8,Sun Mar 22 18:04:05 2015 UTC,"This one's gotta be my favorite from Rated R, just edging out In The Fade. That guitar that comes in at 2:15 gets me every time. I was lucky enough to see it live in Boston."
qotsa,2zwd8q,ClarkKentState,10,Sun Mar 22 13:35:07 2015 UTC,One of the highlights of their live show.

qotsa,2zwd8q,vincientjames,6,Sun Mar 22 14:04:58 2015 UTC,"Quite possibly my favorite of Rated R, the exotic feel the guitar, bass and bongo-type things give it is just so perfect."
qotsa,2zwd8q,spastic-plastic,4,Sun Mar 22 15:19:27 2015 UTC,"This is, has been, and always will be one of my favorite songs of all time. It gives me goddamn chills. The dream-like presence of the lyrics, the driving riff that builds and builds, and the way it all comes down, only to kick you right back in the face. And then the calm... It's such a good song.  I remember standing outside of the venue before my first concert of theirs, and could hear them rehearsing. And I heard that drum beat in the distance and I looked at my fiance and said ""If they play goddamn Better Living Through Chemistry tonight, I'm going to fucking lose it.""  And they did, and they fucking killed it. Every last note hit was perfection, which could be said for the whole show, but this was definitely a highlight. That night was magic, and Josh and crew could tell. I've never been to a concert where that much heart and soul was put into playing. So them playing one of the best songs ever written was nothing short of a life changing experience. As soon as I heard the drums start, I was screaming like a child fresh from the womb. I got teary eyed, having to force myself not to cry. It will always be one of the best moments of my life."
qotsa,2zwd8q,ScruffyThaJanitor,6,Sun Mar 22 20:12:51 2015 UTC,"Definitely one of, if not their best song(s). A perfect example of their ""sound"" that no other band I know of is similar to. I was happily surprised that they played it in Pittsburgh when I saw them."
qotsa,2zwd8q,gunman505,3,Sun Mar 22 18:44:56 2015 UTC,"Amazing song, one of their best I think. The middle part of the song with all the solo'ing and the ""calm"" section really make this an excellent track."

qotsa,2zwd8q,2tidesaday,3,Sun Mar 22 16:42:45 2015 UTC,"Its one of those tracks I never think to put on. Rated R in general isn't my favorite album of theirs, but whenever this one comes on its always great.  I've seen it live a few times and that's really where it shines."
qotsa,2zwd8q,burnt0ast,3,Sun Mar 22 16:31:55 2015 UTC,To be rated r is my second favorite album by them
qotsa,2zwd8q,2tidesaday,2,Sun Mar 22 18:09:21 2015 UTC,"Least favorite for me.  Never a fan of Nick's singing really and he did a lot on this album.  It also seems to be the least cohesive.  Kind of all over the place, which some people like, but not me."
qotsa,2zwd8q,ColdSoreSuperStar,3,Sun Mar 22 19:47:45 2015 UTC,The live version of this song is fucking MINDBLOWING.
qotsa,2zwd8q,CeleryDistraction,3,Mon Mar 23 00:27:10 2015 UTC,It's crazy to me this isn't one of the top 3 most well known QOTSA songs. Better living is one of those rare songs that immediately struck me as amazing and I'm yet to grown tired of it. I love the album version of the song but holy crap does it translate well to live performances-- my dream QOTSA concert would have this song no doubt.   That first riff that kicks in is fucking incredible it's so filthy and beautiful sounding at the same time. Draws you in from the first moments and captivates till the very end. It's a 6 minute song that feels like it's 60 seconds. I've definitely had stretches were I would just listen to this song on repeat and get lost in it.  Amazing song!
qotsa,2zwd8q,theaksy,2,Mon Mar 23 01:43:27 2015 UTC,As it happens I learnt this on guitar the other day - love the song so much! It's so well written!

But for me personally, it's an incredible song to play, to listen to, to let the imagery in your head flow to.... it's incredibly well crafted and just all around awesome."

His camp will feature an Orange Amplifier mobile recording space so look out of live tracks done on site with various desert musicians.    Next up is Dave Catching in Mojave Lords playing on May 2nd in Joshua Tree. Last weekend I saw Dave Catching in the Rancho de la lunatics.  It was a cool show and also featured Gene Trautmann on drums.  Then The Earthlings played with front man Pete Stahl (from Dave Grohls old pubk band Scream) and Adam Maples on drums.  Good times.  Nick Oliveri is in a new band with Joey Castillo called Wino, Joey and Nick are also in the punk band Bl'ast. Joey is also in another punk bad, GFP, with Tony Alva and Greg Hetson. I can go on and on. You can follow me on Instagram or Twitter at @Sharon_LA - I post of a lot of these shows etc."
qotsa,2znu9u,Sharonmf,5,Fri Mar 20 19:13:44 2015 UTC,"The album is ""wrapped up"" is there any type of release date yet? Or time period when it should be released?"
qotsa,2znu9u,jetboyjetgirl,3,Sat Mar 21 13:27:32 2015 UTC,"Hello POSM,  At approximately 5:30AM on Saturday morning I heard two more glorious mastered tracks to be included and from what I understand, the whole album is ""Finished"" and the title is amazing. After that, I sat as Jesse wrote new material (how he composes a song, is most unusual) To see a pic of him writing a new song see my IG account @Sharon_LA I will ask Jesse come on here and talk about the new album, or I will ask him permission for what I can say here.  GET READY"

qotsa,2znu9u,Sharonmf,2,Tue Mar 24 02:32:55 2015 UTC,Probably the biggest fanbase here. Maybe even r/music?

qotsa,2znu9u,PigeonOfShitMetal22,2,Fri Mar 20 15:27:24 2015 UTC,I'm so fucking excited for this album to come out.  One of the most underrated bands working today.
qotsa,2zmi4t,Sharonmf,23,Thu Mar 19 20:38:56 2015 UTC,"I think this is a sort of an exaggerated title. They aren't on hiatus clearly, every band member has other projects that they can work on and are all still a part of qotsa still. I hope..."
qotsa,2zmi4t,sgrwck,4,Thu Mar 19 21:40:37 2015 UTC,"Definitely.  A band coming off the road and taking a year of isn't exactly unheard of.  Oh course, I get the feeling the Josh, much like Dave Grohl, would be perfectly happy never taking a single minute off!"
qotsa,2zmi4t,Pete_Iredale,2,Thu Mar 19 22:14:04 2015 UTC,"Josh doesn't feel like recording yet. When he does they will.  Until then, they're 'on break', or just 'not recording yet'"
qotsa,2zmi4t,jetboyjetgirl,14,Fri Mar 20 03:48:01 2015 UTC,"While I understand and appreciate why they are doing this, I do feel quite let down. Talks of another album later in 2013, talks of them hitting the studio directly after their Halloween show, and then talks of an album later this year. I'm not upset with them. Mikey is busy. Josh is busy. It just sucks :("
qotsa,2zmi4t,spastic-plastic,13,Thu Mar 19 21:46:51 2015 UTC,Also I assume Dean will be busy with new Dead Weather stuff.
qotsa,2zmi4t,ChewyJustice,7,Thu Mar 19 22:51:31 2015 UTC,Dean's also touring with Jack White.
qotsa,2zmi4t,BrBa42,6,Thu Mar 19 23:24:09 2015 UTC,Ah good point. Hoping the Dead Weather also tour once the new album drops
qotsa,2zmi4t,ChewyJustice,3,Thu Mar 19 23:26:57 2015 UTC,Are they working on new material?
qotsa,2zmi4t,spastic-plastic,3,Fri Mar 20 00:34:39 2015 UTC,Well I think its finished actually. They've been releasing singles through Vault packages and I'm pretty sure it's due to be released in 2015 sometime
qotsa,2zmi4t,ChewyJustice,3,Fri Mar 20 00:40:53 2015 UTC,"Troy is also busy with Sweethead, and contributed to the newest Failure. He has something mysterious that he's been hashtagging #gig as well. Dean's busy with The Dead Weather and shows/fests with Jack White. Dave Catching and Chris Goss, iirc, while not 'touring' members, are (to my understanding) part of 'the familia' and are working on Mojave Lords. The only member I haven't been able to figure out 'the next step' for, is Jon Theodore... he was working with Phil Manley in Life Coach, but seems to have sort-of disappeared."

qotsa,2zmi4t,WillWhite,3,Fri Mar 20 03:15:16 2015 UTC,"Sadly, that was almost ten years ago at this point. I loved that EP and I've always been disappointed they never followed it up."

qotsa,2zmi4t,thedeadweather,4,Thu Mar 19 21:44:47 2015 UTC,I've been listening to the new tracks over a t Jesse Hughes's house - this will be the best EODM record - ever.  They just finished mastering.

qotsa,2zmi4t,ZouTiger026,5,Fri Mar 20 05:33:37 2015 UTC,"Well, yeah... that makes sense. Mikey is doing Mini Mansions, and Josh is probably involved with the new EODM record."
qotsa,2zmi4t,UniformRecon,3,Thu Mar 19 22:01:20 2015 UTC,They just finished mastering the new EODM album with Josh on drums - badass!!

The record is sick and I think it is the best EODM to date.  Look out for a track called ""Silverlake"" (might be renamed The Overpass) as it will be super hit for sure.  They also doing a bitchin cover that I will mention at another time. Jesse Hughes just finished his residency with his side band, Boots Electric.

qotsa,2zmi4t,mooninitetwo,2,Thu Mar 19 22:30:14 2015 UTC,"I definitely don't blame them for taking a break, their line of work is exhausting, however I do resent the empty promises. I guess I'm used to it by now, having been a QOTSA fan for years and all."
qotsa,2zmi4t,Rasengan2012,2,Fri Mar 20 01:32:47 2015 UTC,"Not too surprised by this. I was sceptical about another record that fast coming from Josh who honestly needs to take the time to get the next record perfected.

qotsa,2zgds9,NinjaKillBunny,3,Wed Mar 18 19:56:10 2015 UTC,Could be right. I had always heard the label wasn't too jazzed to have a song with that name on the album. I know they rerecorded it because the lullabies and era versions sound pretty different.
qotsa,2zgds9,adrian1897,2,Wed Mar 18 20:52:41 2015 UTC,"On the LTP liner notes it says something like ""The Fun Machine Took a Shit and Died: the tapes were lost or stolen."""

qotsa,2zgng2,ProudHommesexual,12,Wed Mar 18 12:54:05 2015 UTC,"Songs for the Deaf is one of my least favourite QOTSA album as well but I still love it. I don't rank it quite as highly as their other works but that doesn't mean I don't see it as a classic.  For me, every track is a winner however the radio sections, though very enjoyable at first, can get boring after repeated listens.    I also don't feel it has the 'depth' of some of their other albums.  While Era Vulgaris took me a long time to get into and has far less hooks than Songs for the Deaf, I much prefer it because of how much it rewards those who stick with it and give quite a few listens.  It took me probably 10+ listens to really get the album but when I did, it became one of my favourite albums ever.  Songs for the Deaf on the other hand is so immediate and instantly accessible that I feel it doesn't have that same level of depth as some of their other albums, which is probably why it's so popular among non QOTSA fans.    Having said all that, it's still a top album with some amazing songs and it's an album I've listened to a massive amount and got a lot of enjoyment out of.  Also, I'm sorry, but The Sky is Falling kicks ass."
qotsa,2zgng2,Wizard-in--Black,8,Wed Mar 18 13:07:10 2015 UTC,"I say the exact same thing every time discussion turns to Songs for the Deaf, and this time will be no different. If you want to really get what the album is about, here's what you need to do:  Some night this summer, when the temperature is in the mid 70s to low 80s, and you have nothing to do, hop in the car, roll the windows down and take a drive. Throw this album on and listen to it top to bottom. If you have a friend who you can sit with in stretches of comfortable silence, take them along.   Drive down some roads that you're a little less familiar with. I'm not saying you need to get yourself lost, just get out of the area where your brain kicks into auto pilot.  I wholehearted believe that this is the closest you can get to replicating the spirit of the record as a whole. I always get the impression that Songs for the Deaf is supposed to be the experience of driving through the desert in an old convertable. The sun has set but the air still holds the warmth of the day. Some bizarre pirate radio station cuts through the static: ""I need a saga..."""
qotsa,2zgng2,andintroducingzylex,3,Thu Mar 19 02:56:57 2015 UTC,"Man, I absolutely agree with this. Stoner rock in general is my favorite music to go driving down the highway or some mountain road with the windows rolled down and the music blasting, and this album is the premium example of that."
qotsa,2zgng2,honeynoats,7,Sat Mar 21 01:01:11 2015 UTC,"Holy crap. How can anyone explain the amazing power of SFTD?  Every song has a cohesiveness to it that makes it more than other songs. The album itself has a cohesiveness that moves it beyond other albums.   The radio chatter becomes background filler when listening to the album as a whole.   There is a flow from song to song that doesn't exist on other albums.   If I meet someone who doesn't know much about QOTSA, this is the album I play from start to finish and by the end they are almost in tears because they know an album that good will never come around again in their lifetime.   You have mentioned the individual songs but it needs to be heard in a single setting. It is jaw droppingly over the top good."
qotsa,2zgng2,stealthhealth,6,Wed Mar 18 13:31:45 2015 UTC,"There is a flow from song to song that doesn't exist on other albums.    This does it for me, I actually feel like im listening to a single journey /story rather then all kind of mixed tracks like its on the other albums (besides Like Clockwork... maybe, which imo follows a very similar vibe in terms of this, its flows smoothly from track to track."
qotsa,2zgng2,pn42,1 point,Wed Mar 18 20:51:29 2015 UTC,I love ...Like Clockwork's transitions. So good.
qotsa,2zgng2,flemhead3,1 point,Thu Mar 19 01:37:30 2015 UTC,"I guess it's just musical preference. I haven't heard of people saying that the first album is their favorite. So clearly even though over here in r/qotsa we are all big fans of Queens, we all still have musical preferences and it shows in our favorite songs and albums. Songs for the Deaf is my 3rd favorite album from them and their self titled album is probably at the bottom of my favorites list.   In the same way, with RHCP, I LOVE their older albums just as much as their new albums. But a lot of my friends who love By the Way. Stadium Arcadium, Californication etc... But they hate Freaky Styley, UPMP and the self titled album. Simple musical preference.   To answer your question, I guess Qotsa's sound mostly attracts fans who really like the style of music presented to us from Songs of the Deaf."
qotsa,2zgng2,Rasengan2012,2,Wed Mar 18 13:37:48 2015 UTC,"That's a really good comparison, although QOTSA have evolved and I feel like the Chillis full on metamorphosed, when John replaced Hillel, into something else.  Mothers Milk was my first Chillis album and it sounds like a completely different band than BTW, both are great but I get why newer fans would have a hard time connecting to the early material. But, it's harder for me to get that with QOTSA especially the self titled album. If the self titled album had Infinity on it, it would be the greatest album ever made. Since it doesn't, I think it ties for the best QOTSA album.  But I think for a lot of people whatever album they heard first and got them into a band is always the best in their mind, so SFTD for most people. For me, it was hearing Lost Art on the radio and then downloading on napster or limewire about half of each of the first two records and having my mind blown by You Can't Quit Me Baby and then special ordering the albums at the record store because they weren't in stock, or a known thing at all in W. Lafayette Indiana. But hearing Better Living Through Chemistry through headphones made me a lifelong fan."

I'll let you know what I think again then :) but you're right, the album that gets a person into a band is usually their favourite album."
qotsa,2zgng2,Rasengan2012,1 point,Sat Mar 21 00:43:30 2015 UTC,"It was the album that got me into qotsa, and was my most favourite.   Now I appreciate clockwork, rated r and self titled a lot, lot more. Its wierd, I only really like songs for deaf if I'm in the mood for it. Probably because its just a bit harder rock. Equally like kyuss, I couldn't always listen to it because I'm not always in the mood for that sort of music, yet I could listen to Rated R anytime anyplace."
qotsa,2zgng2,gowithetheflowdb,1 point,Wed Mar 18 15:06:11 2015 UTC,"For me, it has a lot to do with hearing that album first. The third or fourth time through was when I decided QOTSA was the best rock bad around. I actually find myself listening to ...Like Clockwork and Lullabies more these days, and my favorite song (""Monsters in the Parasol"") is from Rated R. But I'll always have a soft spot for Songs for the Deaf. I spent that entire autumn and the next summer driving around with the windows down, listening to that album cranked on the truck radio. It has stuck with me."

qotsa,2zgng2,vincientjames,1 point,Thu Mar 19 02:40:27 2015 UTC,"I think the magic of the album is that its literally a tour through all the styles the guys in Qotsa can pull of. The flipping from station to station is a good conduit for that, as well as adds to the atmosphere of driving down through Bumfuckville, Nowhere... they go from these blistering rock tracks to lazy hypnotic blues rock to poppy broken-heart tunes... and as generic as they might be, they fit the concept. The FM tuner landed on a poppy love song station at that point. While I dont like songs like Gonna Leave You and Do It Again, i usually skip them, I cant think of any other queens song that would fit in their place. Those songs serve a purpose to that album that nothing else can fulfill.  Thats what makes it a masterpiece. Its not.my favorite queens album but I respect it for how genius the concept is and was executed."
qotsa,2zgng2,amouthforwar,1 point,Tue Mar 24 21:13:39 2015 UTC,"I think its a bit long, definitely some 'filler' songs on there like Do it Again (and I totally agree about The Sky is Falling)"

qotsa,2zcfs6,Truth-Addict,1 point,Tue Mar 17 23:10:53 2015 UTC,"I've had them for about 3 months, and with low light exposure prior they'll still glow enough to make out the images. If I purposely shined light on them, which i've did once, it's very detailed. I'm sure with time they'll lose that effect, but still bad ass posters regardless."
qotsa,2zcfs6,pine_apples,1 point,Tue Mar 17 23:29:35 2015 UTC,"Some personal faves of mine:  Neal Williams does some really nice, intricate work, very different from the usual QOTSA poster style.  This triptych by Miles Tsang is pretty awesome - all 3 fit together to make one scene, and they're Glow in the Dark too.  And these Vincent Price (my gig!) and Cleopatra themed posters by Brian Ewing. I have both of these, and they have a fantastic metallic finish to them, so the poster changes depending on where you're standing."

qotsa,2yqvzv,Habsterbation,6,Thu Mar 12 03:48:50 2015 UTC,"It had to grow on me for sure.  I love it now, but in my early listenings of  Lullabies, I would just skip it."
qotsa,2yqvzv,Habsterbation,4,Thu Mar 12 05:03:41 2015 UTC,"That's how I felt about ""Tangled Up In Plaid"" and ""The Blood Is Love"" when I first heard them. Lullabies can initially be a kind of difficult record like that. Still waiting for ""I Never Came"" and ""Skin On Skin"" to grow on me though (terribly unpopular opinions, I know).  Always loved this particular song. Bluesy, slinking, brooding with sexual tension. The perfect bridge between the manic, sex-addled ""Broken Box"" and the more bittersweet, aptly-named ""Long Slow Goodbye""."
qotsa,2yqvzv,Approval_Guy,2,Thu Mar 12 05:20:10 2015 UTC,"It's weird to hear someone saying that Lullabies is a bit of a difficult album. I loved S/T, Rated R and Lullabies right away, but SFTD took awhile (there were always songs that I liked, but a lot of the album was meh to me at first), and Era Vulgaris took some a long time to grow on me.   Funny that you mention ""I Never Came"" because that's one of the only songs from Lullabies that I can't get into (one of the others being ""Long Slow Goodbye""). It's always felt like one of the things that Pearl Jam would do that I'd dislike (songs with that vibe are a big part of why I don't like PJ much), but with Josh singing."
qotsa,2yqvzv,Habsterbation,3,Thu Mar 12 21:26:53 2015 UTC,"I think what made Lullabies difficult for me at first was the length. Sure, it's slightly shorter than SotD, but the latter didn't quite feel as long because of its unifying concept. Lullabies also had ""Someone's In The Wolf,"" ""The Blood Is Love"" and ""Skin On Skin"", three of the band's most exhausting tracks, back-to-back. As a prog fan, the length of this album shouldn't phase me but it does for some reason.  My biggest issue with ""I Never Came"" is how dull the guitar line is. That, and the chorus doesn't really provide enough pay-off for the ""build-up"". And the solo's blah. And the length is a bit much for a song like that. And the... Alright, I'll quit trashing it now."
qotsa,2yqvzv,Habsterbation,3,Thu Mar 12 23:29:25 2015 UTC,"What made it difficult for me is how it seemed to tread water, really.  It doesn't have the forward momentum of any other Queens album, in fact it shares a lot in common with Self-Titled in that respect.  But because of its willingness to simmer, rather than blaze, it becomes a much more engrossing album with each listen."
qotsa,2yqvzv,rapemybones,2,Fri Mar 13 04:44:30 2015 UTC,"That's actually a really good way to put it. However, I'm not sure if I agree about the self-titled. Yeah, its pace comes to a crawl around ""You Would Know"", but otherwise it's pretty constantly driving forward. Except for the 2011 reissue. ""The Bronze"" is a great awesome addition, but the other two bonus tracks kill the momentum of the album's last act."
qotsa,2yqvzv,SixshooteR32,3,Fri Mar 13 15:45:43 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, I get what you're saying. Lullabies definitely does feel longer/slower paced than SFTD. I feel differently about ""Someone's In The Wolf"" + ""Skin On Skin"", but I'm with you on ""Blood Is Love"". I can see why people would dislike them, but ""...Wolf"" + ""Skin On Skin"" have always been some of my favorites from Lullabies.  And yeah, I agree completely with your complaints for ""I Never Came"". Everything about it just makes me dislike it, and I tend to skip it completely when I listen to Lullabies. x__x"
qotsa,2yqvzv,BinaryChode,2,Fri Mar 13 05:33:44 2015 UTC,"Oh, I love ""Someone's In The Wolf"" and ""The Blood Is Love"" (especially the former). Still exhausting listens, though, kind of like ""Walkin' On The Sidewalks"" from their debut. I would probably like ""Skin On Skin"" more if it didn't immediately follow those two tracks. When things get that drawn out, you need an energy boost to get the pace back on track (which is why ""Broken Box"" is one of my favorite tracks), and that track plods along too slowly to fulfill that role."
qotsa,2yqvzv,rapemybones,2,Fri Mar 13 15:42:43 2015 UTC,"Josh and other band mates have said that when they talk amongst themselves about their songs they often group them into ""families"" based on similar vibes and moods you get from listening to them. i.e. I think Josh said that ""Lost Art of Keeping a Secret"" was sisters with ""Leg of Lamb"" for their more ""pop-y"" feel that they provoke without being a cookie cutter pop song.   I've always felt that ""I Never Came"" is a sister to ""In My Head"" for the same reason, songs that are the more basic sounding tracks than the regular Queens sound. Anyone know any other related songs?"

qotsa,2ylvw4,kittyqotsa,10,Tue Mar 10 21:53:30 2015 UTC,"FWIW 999 is the UK emergency phone number (their version of the USA 911) and the artist that did those drawings is from the UK.   Never heard anything ""official"" on the nines, but that's my best guess, other than being 666 upside down."
qotsa,2ylvw4,PumpTruck,3,Tue Mar 10 22:05:48 2015 UTC,hmmmm good to know thanks w
qotsa,2ylvw4,hmakein,10,Tue Mar 10 23:28:17 2015 UTC,"I remember Josh talking about the album being really difficult to work on because he wasn't in the right place for it. Then a bunch of bad stuff happened (the Kyuss lives debacle, the medical emergency he almost didn't come back from, etc.) so he gathered his close friends and made himself vulnerable by writing an album about it. Essentially, he took a hellish time in his life and flipped it on its head. 666 became 999, in other words."
qotsa,2ylvw4,jarvispeen,2,Wed Mar 11 01:29:12 2015 UTC,"woah, thank you, makes a whole lotta sense."

Of course, if you literally value the signatures as just signatures, this bundle might be a better offer anyway. As an investment though, the record would certainly be preferable."

qotsa,2ykzy4,Wizard-in--Black,1 point,Tue Mar 17 22:17:59 2015 UTC,Local music shops sometimes get coloured vinyl copies of album in if you're lucky.  There's no guaranties and it might well be too limited to reach the shops but it's worth checking.
qotsa,2ykzy4,ChewyJustice,1 point,Wed Mar 11 00:57:23 2015 UTC,Ive bought vinyl from overseas plenty now and never had any issues. You can request that they take the record out of the sleeve if that makes it any better

qotsa,2ykzy4,adrian1897,1 point,Thu Mar 12 19:55:17 2015 UTC,"Side note - as a vinyl collector, I have to say that this is a pretty sound investment. If cared for well or left sealed entirely, this record is pretty much guaranteed to appreciate in value. Not to mention that the popularity of Mini Mansions themselves is shooting towards the sky, with their Any Emotions getting nearly 5x as many plays on Spotify as the MOST PLAYED song on their debut album, and with collaborations with names like Alex Turner and Brian Wilson."

qotsa,2yccc1,PoorGuyThatManJohnT,34,Sun Mar 8 15:30:28 2015 UTC,"First time commenting on something like this so don't hate me but I gotta disagree  Worst song? No way man, this is a great song, a song that really puts on display their versatility as real artists, that's not to say there aren't songs that do that better. I think the music is an excellent balance between dark, sensual and epic. Dark because of Homme's intentionally imperfect falsetto which I find kinda haunting, it seems also like he means to portray a broken character building up to a stronger point as his voice becomes stronger. Sensual in the guitar parts, the mini solos between, notably after the line 'when the sun is gone so are.. [solo]', a solo packed with vigour and passion that just fits in so well. The epic side I think comes in with the additional vocals (someone help me here I can't remember who it was, was it Alain?), when the vocals start getting stronger and the backups come in there's just this victorious vibe radiating out of the voices. As well the lyrics are very very good, some people might disagree but the language is some of Homme's best in terms of meaning IMO. Obviously the song as a whole is about the character not needing friends who only stick around for the easy times (fairweather), but the word play, the figurative language, and the overall lyric structure are all incredible I believe. There are other contributing factors like the keys, their composition and the fact that Sir Elton John collaborated with them, and I think they reinforce my point about the artistic showcase that is fairweather friends. 8-9/10 for me based on that. Though I definitely wouldn't say it's one of their best, this is song for me is more of an example of their music ability."
qotsa,2yccc1,xTheNameless,14,Sun Mar 8 16:44:23 2015 UTC,"I love this song. Gets too much hate IMO.   ...LC is really an album I relate to, I had my own brush with death a couple of years ago, and I really relate to this song. Lot of people turned their backs on me after I had my experience."
qotsa,2yccc1,RPDC,9,Sun Mar 8 16:57:22 2015 UTC,"Is it not ""Gossip, frauds, and snakes"", not drugs?  Either way, this song is powerful. I was hooked from the second it started. Great vocals and lyrics here."
qotsa,2yccc1,spastic-plastic,4,Sun Mar 8 18:51:31 2015 UTC,"http://www.qotsa.com/extendedcredits/   Official website confirms ""Gossip Frauds and Snakes."""
qotsa,2yccc1,RPDC,7,Sun Mar 8 21:58:44 2015 UTC,"Absolutely fantastic song. Grohl goes balls out on his drum fills for this one (at least in contrast to other songs on this album) and i fucking love the piano parts Elton John contributes. A great part of the song is the lyrics that reference ""Walkin' on the sidewalks"". Probably the most interesting thing about the song is Elton John's influence and technique mixed in with Josh and Company's instrumentation. Its beautiful moments like these that make me love collaborations in music."
qotsa,2yccc1,mcmahon212,7,Sun Mar 8 18:33:09 2015 UTC,"Probably the weakest song on ...LC. It strikes me as being a little too ""straightforward"" without really having the sort of frantic energy of, say, Go With the Flow or Sick Sick Sick. Like its a perfectly fine song, and I dig the lyrics, it just doesn't grab me in anyway. It feels... flat? Not like the pitch, like the actual sensation of a flat surface.   It moves from one section to the next so quickly that you never really feel the anticipation and tension that should be resolved when it goes into the chorus. Which is unfortunate since there are a lot of great individual elements in there.  If this song were in a B-Sides collection, or a different bands discography, it would be a stand out track."
qotsa,2yccc1,andintroducingzylex,3,Mon Mar 9 00:37:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there's none of the weirdness or danger that queens songs have and what makes them special.  FF is pretty generic.  It's something I've heard before and the lyrics are just cheesy.  It's among the worst songs they've ever done.  99% of QOTSA songs have something about them that makes them weird, unique, different. Just a boring song with nothing memorable IMO.  It was pretty good live though."
qotsa,2yccc1,BadMemory71,2,Mon Mar 9 10:49:15 2015 UTC,"Shit, I never really knew why I was never feeling this song, but you just described it pretty much perfectly."
qotsa,2yccc1,adrian1897,6,Mon Mar 9 00:57:04 2015 UTC,I didn't like this song until I saw them play it live outdoors on a beautiful evening last summer. They played this song just as the sun was setting and it was a great moment.          I much prefer the live version that's on the QOTSA Archive Soundcloud to the studio version. I remember them saying the mixing of this song was a last minute rush job and I think it shows.
qotsa,2yccc1,quikslvr223,5,Sun Mar 8 17:46:56 2015 UTC,"I think this is a fantastic song, about 8.5/10 or so. It brings a bit more variety to the album and is a great transition song. Between the falsetto and the piano and how everything comes together perfectly in the end only to be cut off with a classic 'I don't give a shit' from Josh, it's definitely a highlight for me."
qotsa,2yccc1,thedonuggs,4,Sun Mar 8 21:04:33 2015 UTC,"It's actually one of my favorites on the album. It feels... diverse, I guess would be the word. I suppose there's a feeling of equal contribution from every single instrument. I find Josh's singing to suit the feel of the song. Elton John's piano is great (but admittedly unnecessary). Dave... Dave just fuckin' does Dave, you know?   A particular favorite part for me is the ending, the ""I don't give a shit about 'em anyhow..."" It's unique interesting, even a bit comical. I think it's great."
qotsa,2yccc1,Approval_Guy,3,Mon Mar 9 01:04:13 2015 UTC,"I agree. It's a good song, but it's still the worst on the album, and maybe in general"
qotsa,2yccc1,Wizard-in--Black,3,Sun Mar 8 18:35:53 2015 UTC,"It's a great song, but it doesn't sound like a Queens of the Stone Age song to me.  The solos are fucking gnarly, but it just plays it really safe.  However, the gripes I have about this song are the same gripes I have with Like Clockwork as a whole: too vocal driven for my tastes."
qotsa,2yccc1,-Dapper-Dan-,2,Mon Mar 9 04:12:34 2015 UTC,"I won't lie; Fairweather Friends has never been one of my favourite QOTSA songs but I certainly don't dislike it.  It's great for a sing a long and it's definitely a fun track with a really catchy, enjoyable chorus.  It doesn't hit as me as a masterpiece like a lot of other tracks off ...LC, though.  It's certainly no I Appear Missing.  Calling it 'weak' is going a bit far though - Josh isn't capable of writing a 'weak' song, though this is far from his best."
qotsa,2yccc1,paddypatronus,2,Sun Mar 8 16:44:38 2015 UTC,"Whenever I mention to friends that Sir Elton John is on this album, I have to specifically point out his contribution. There's no way you'd know it was him the damn piano track is so buried. By far their worst song on LC, if not in general."
qotsa,2yccc1,sexdrugsncarltoncole,2,Mon Mar 9 11:57:21 2015 UTC,"I fucking love this song. It is powerful as hell and the guitar solos are kickass. The first chorus is balls out rock and roll, and it just keeps climbing from there. It's not traditional Queens, but I think it shows their versatility and talent. I really don't get how anyone could dislike this track. Probably my favourite Queens song. A 10 from me."
qotsa,2y9gs1,isawfootage,30,Sat Mar 7 18:49:41 2015 UTC,"Other than Josh which is kinda the default answer I think probably Troy. He has been around a while now and his guitar playing works perfectly for the band. Him and Josh as guitarists work together really well I think. The band wouldn't be the same without him, for sure."

Mark kills it on every track he is part of (In the Fade, Hanging Tree, God is on the Radio), and Alain was a great addition to the band, as proven by being the 4th Vulture.

qotsa,2y9gs1,MarcyProjects,1 point,Mon Mar 9 15:05:21 2015 UTC,"I honestly think Grohl's main impact was the name recognition.  Having him play on the 3rd LP was part of a confluence of good things happening for the band.  The influx of new fans at that time was such a boost.  Personally, he's my least favorite QOTSA drummer.  Joey up top, of course."

I love Joey but Jon is the definition of perfection when it comes to timing but still being a monster live. Seeing QOTSA live twice last year was amazing and every songs tempo seemed to be right for the mood, make it wit chu wasn't too fast, and no one knows wasn't too slow. Seeing this guy play live instantly made him my favourite. (Other than Josh and maybe Troy)"

qotsa,2y9gs1,NinjaBoss,3,Sun Mar 8 01:43:15 2015 UTC,It has to be Dean. What made me love him was seeing them live for the first time and Josh broke a string and without hesitation Dean grabbed his guitar and took over Josh's role. That and he kills on the keys. 10/10 would Dean again
qotsa,2y9gs1,Bewbz_lol,4,Sun Mar 8 14:00:03 2015 UTC,"I think Alfredo Hernandez was my favourite drummer, he was the perfect pick to transition Josh from his Kyuss era to create QotSA. His lines aren't too complicated yet they are so fun to listen to and even more to play."

He's a very original, melodic bass player and although his vocals are love/hate, some of my favourite early songs are sung by him.  He wouldn't have suited some of band's later albums but during their hard rock phase (SFTD and parts of Rated R) he was the perfect addition to the band."
qotsa,2y9gs1,Wizard-in--Black,6,Sat Mar 7 19:57:54 2015 UTC,"I'm not a fan of Nick as a person, musically he's great but he seems to be a dick IRL, for example making fun of qotsa fans, insulting Brody Dalle to Josh Homme's face and being arrested for domestic violence."
qotsa,2y9gs1,Wizard-in--Black,5,Sat Mar 7 20:09:27 2015 UTC,"I was actually going to put something in my first post about the fact that he's a dick but I thought better of it because I thought I would have been majorly downvoted.  He's a great musician and all but I completely agree, the guy has been a real arsehole on multiple occasions.  This is a good example of that.  Shit like Domestic Violence is really unforgivable as far as I'm concerned.  It doesn't change the fact that he's a brilliant musician, but it does make me think a lot less of him as a person."
qotsa,2y9gs1,Snidernomore,1 point,Sun Mar 8 00:13:41 2015 UTC,"Shit like Domestic Violence is really unforgivable as far as I'm concerned.   Is it unforgiveable if it only happens once?  I really don't care about Nick, he doesn't seem to be a great person. On a more societal level: if a man hit his wife once, pays the price for it, and never does it again, is it really unforgiveable?  Domestic Violence is a serious issue. But I hate this mob mentality society is moving towards. He did a very bad thing, paid the price, and if it never happens again? That's not unforgiveable, that's a mistake that a human being is working on fixing.  And villifying mistakes isn't going to better fix the problem going forward. You just alienate the person and make them less want to see the error of their ways."

You're blowing what I said out of proportion though - I'm not saying that he's a totally awful person who can never be accepted in society because he's made a few mistakes.  It's not my place (or anyone else's) to make such judgements, however from what I have read I don't see any reason to believe that he only ever committed one act of domestic violence.  In 2011 he was in a stand-off with a swat team because he was keeping his girlfriend in the house against her will.  He had a loaded gun in the house and he was charged with domestic violence.  There have been reports of him being physically aggressive with people in the past.    As far as I'm concerned there's mistakes and then there's crimes.  With something like domestic violence even one case is too much.  Multiple?  Even worse.  I'm not talking about alienating anyone or promoting a mob mentality, I'm simply saying that some repeated mistakes/crimes are too major to just be totally forgotten with no repercussions."

qotsa,2xzba9,paddypatronus,6,Thu Mar 5 04:17:55 2015 UTC,"Spinning in Daffodils (TCV).  One of my top songs under the whole Homme umbrella.  I was super obsessed with this song for awhile and even did a cover of it. A Song For the Deaf (Even though there is bonus track I always shut it off after this one).  I get chills every time.  One of the most sinister songs I've ever heard. I Think I Lost My Headache.  Prefer live versions to the studio.  The riff is amazing and can go on FOREVER and I wouldn't get sick of it.  Also really fun to play, but I gotta say I'm not a huge fan of the extended horn section.  Love it at the start, but kind of wish it would fade away sooner before it gets all crazy.  Still a wild ride though. I'm Your Torpedo (EODM).  Love the drums in this one.  And a rare moment with Josh singing part of the lead on an EODM track.  Makes you sort of realize how amazing it would be if he sang lead more often.  Although its hard to top Boots. Run Pug Run - Definitely the perfect closer to Era.  Kind of like a what the fuck did I just listen to?  It's like that gross smell that you kinda like. ...Like Clockwork.  My least favorite track off their latest album, but that's not saying much because I still love it.  Love the way the last note rings out.  Leaves you feeling overall impressed with the album. Long Slow Goodbye.  Sad to put it this low.  Not the most eventful song in their catalogue, but its still great.  Josh's solo version here is pretty great.  I love the horn outro on this.  Also they used a production technique which I think its under utilized. instead of fading they just saturate the reverb until is 100% wet, which I love.  Only heard a few other people do that. I Was a Teenage Hand Model.  I like this song.  Nice little melody.  Again not really a fan of the crazy noises at the end.  Never really been a fan of them in any music.  Also I'm pretty sure they recorded audio of someone pissing...and I know there's a phone message from Nick saying he was going to join the band for the next album, which is a pretty cool touch."

qotsa,2xzba9,2tidesaday,9,Thu Mar 5 05:35:54 2015 UTC,"Here's mine, I had this in the main post but it was way too big:  7) Long Slow Goodbye - Honestly, this is really their only closer that's not a 10/10 for me. It's not a bad song or anything, it just really doesn't do too much to stand out. Still, that last ""Goodbye"" is fucking amazing, some of Homme's best vocals. I'm always gonna wish Someone's In Wolf the closer though.  6) A Song For The Deaf - I can't believe I'm putting this song in second to last. Its got the best riff on the album, the chorus is great, you gotta love ""The blind can go and get fucked"" part, and the last radio bit is the perfect way to end the album. Really just a great all around track, on a different day I probably could've put it at 2.  5) Spinning In The Daffodils - This song is just crazy, it's kinda like a stripped down Someone's In The Wolf, and it is fucking awesome. Nothing like hearing that riff for the first time after the piano fake-out intro. And the build in this song is really just something else, by the end of the song you barely tell what's going on everything's so distorted.  4) Run Pig Run - Really couldn't be a better way to end Era Vulgaris. This song is just sick, the riff that comes after the chorus is probably me second favorite of all time, by any band (behind Someone's In The Wolf). The whole thing's just so fast paced it ridiculous. I gotta admit that the lyrics on this one kinda suck though.  3) I Was A Teenage Hand Model - The mood this song sets is perfect. Coming off the pretty much straight-up nonstop hard rock of every song before this on the debut, there really wasn't a better way they could've ended it. I think the opening lines might be my favorite lyrics in any QOTSA song, and Homme's vocals on the chorus are just smooth as hell.   2) ...Like Clockwork - Fucking crazy that this and Battery Acid are songs from the same band. This one's just beautiful all the way around; Homme's best vocals, brilliant lyrics, and that great instrumental bit. Smooth Sailing to this song has gotta be one of the best 3 song stretches on any album.  1) I Think I Lost My Headache - I honestly think this is the best closing song of all time. Really the whole Rated R was schizophrenic as hell (in a good way), so there really wasn't a better way to end it than this. The first couple of minutes of the song are great, but that closing riff is just something else. There's not another band in the world that could take an off key, 5 minute long trumpet solo and make the highlight of the album. In my top 10 songs of all time without a doubt."

qotsa,2xzba9,ColdSoreSuperStar,2,Thu Mar 5 19:05:55 2015 UTC,"I Think I Lost My Headache - Ranking these as closers rather than songs on their own merit, otherwise RPR would probably be number one. It's all already been said, Rated R couldn't have closed a better way. Mosquito Song - I'm counting this as an honorary closing track because it's my list and I do what I want. Along with Headache and Pig, it sits in my top five QOTSA songs. The haunting melodies, the calmly dark lyrics, the spectacular instrumental section with pianos, strings, and horns, such a perfect song in every way. Spinning in Daffodils - Since I guess TCV is just considered honorary QOTSA around here. It feels odd ranking it amongst QOTSA closers because musically that album is so far detached from the Queens catalog, but I put it here by an inch because it truly is a spectacular song and conclusion to the record. Some of Homme's finest lyrics, bookended by the darkly poignant intro and outro. Run, Pig, Run - One of my absolute favorite Queens songs and killer ending to EV. One of the most thoroughly badass songs I've ever heard. Song for the Deaf - Hate leaving it down this low but the competition couldn't be more fierce. Unlike all the others, this is a grand finale that was built to the entire album, what with being the title track, it was the culmination of the album's recurring concept. And man, I vividly remember the first time Another Love Song came to its end and that introduction began and I knew this was gonna fucking rule. So heavy, so sinister. Long Slow Goodbye - Weird having this so low simply because Lullabies is my favorite album and you'd think that it'd have my favorite closer or at least one of them. And while it's a great song, it really isn't even close to being one of my favorites from that album. It's exactly as described: a slow, quiet, peaceful fade to black for the long, storied journey that preceded it.  I Was a Teenage Hand Model - And that trend continues as we're now completely away from the loud, bombastic finishes most of the albums had with a laid back reflection on what's just happened. Like Lullabies, the self-titled kind of hits its crescendo a few tracks before the actual last song (Someone's in the Wolf/YCQMB) and from there unwinds to this point. There's not a damn thing wrong with that, and it's a hella catchy and standout track from the album.  ...Like Clockwork - Again, great song, but this one just hasn't ever really connected with me like a wanted it to. I can't explain it, it just doesn't tend to resonate like any of these other tracks do (or I Appear Missing right before it). I feel like it might've worked better if LC (the album) wasn't so damn short. The other ""slow"" endings came after hour-long albums filled with peaks and valleys in tone and energy, while the shorter records (R and Era) were loud and abrasive (and a kick in the ass in the case of ""Pig""). Clockwork is a great album but it feels too brief for that kind of conclusion."

Before and during the show I got little more drunk than I would've liked to.  The girlfriend and I still wanted to meet the band after the show regardless of how much party I had. While waiting outside the exit with a couple dozen other fans, Mikey, Troy and Dean made their way out and hung out with everyone and shot the shit. They were answering questions, telling stories, signing autographs. The gal and I just hung back and took it easy. Seemed like nice, genuine guys.  After 10 or 15 minutes, Josh comes out. He saw how many people were waiting, hesitated, kind of stutter stepped and started walking towards everyone; my girlfriend and I being the closest to him. Walks right up to me - Combined with me being too drunk, seeing that he might not be in the best mood and trying to respect his privacy - I just stepped towards him and said ""I just want to shake your hand."" He nods his head, gives me a firm handshake, says ""cool"" and heads towards the crowd.  Everyone else swarms him, respectfully. A guy and his kid are holding the vinyl reissue of QOTSA and asks him to sign it. While he's signing the record, a guy who had been the most obnoxious one in the crowd the entire time says really loudly, ""Hey Josh, I stood in line to get front row for like 8 hours."" Josh keeps going about his business ""I even pissed in a can, bro!"" Josh looks over at him with a sneer ""... But I guess that's pretty fuckin' gay, huh?.."" ""Yeah, dude.. That's pretty fuckin' gay,"" Josh replies. Josh heads straight for the tour bus.  I look over at the guy, completely embarrassed and deflated. I imagine he screamed at himself the entire car ride home."

He's been touring England with Mini Mansions and after every show the band have been coming out to talk to the fans and sign stuff. I've been a big Queens/Mini Mansions fan for years so i was trying my best not to freak out the entire time, but he was really nice.

qotsa,2xvquc,circusofhorrors,4,Wed Mar 4 20:08:25 2015 UTC,"I've spoke about my meeting with them before on the sub but I like talking about it as it brings back good memories...  Basically met them just as they were getting on the bus. Some guy yelled ""Josh! Over here!"" and he came over, signed my album cover.   Now this was in November, and 3 months prior to this I met Nick playing in Bristol. Really laid back, spent about an hour chatting to him before he played about beer and other random shit. He also shared an emotional story about his mate who had just passed away.  Anyways, he mentions of a 'project' with Josh that was going to happen sometime soon.   Fast forward to the night of meeting queens - knowing about the 'project' I say ""Hey Josh, I met Nick earlier in the summer"" - To which he replied ""Tell Nick I said hey"" - which I didn't really get at the time. I still don't to be honest.  But the band all signed my cover, got a picture with Josh (which I later found out I wasn't even in) and was on my way.  Yesterday however, Mike didn't say more than 3 words. Didn't smile once either. Which was weird because when I met him first time, he was quite cheery."

Was running a bit late and since John Paul and Josh didn't know each other all that well yet, they were just kind of waiting in awkward silence and Jones said to Homme, ""Soooo... What've ya got? Anything you're working on?"" Homme played the intro to Reptiles and JPJ thought it was so strange that he was like, ""What in the hell did I get myself into?"""
qotsa,2xk5gc,MROlson,9,Sun Mar 1 15:52:36 2015 UTC,That's also kind of how Interlude (with Ludes) came about. Grohl couldn't make it that day and they found some weird audio file on the computer in the studio and just wrote lyrics over it. Then Grohl came in and recorded his drum track using a kid drum set or something.

qotsa,2xk5gc,mcmahon212,4,Sun Mar 1 17:02:43 2015 UTC,It's not exactly my favorite TCV song but it's definitely kickass. It has that creepy vibe to it also found in Interlude and Daffodils.  I always pictured a horror-style chase scene to go with it.
qotsa,2xk5gc,ColdSoreSuperStar,5,Sun Mar 1 15:49:09 2015 UTC,"Tasteteful dissonance is the key to my heart.  It seriously takes a lot of skill to make a song like this work and be enjoyable to listen.  I think when Josh first had the idea a lot of people in the studio were hesitant to go forward with it, but I'm glad they did.  Essential for a full album listen and sounds great going into Interlude with Ludes."
qotsa,2xk5gc,2tidesaday,4,Sun Mar 1 18:52:09 2015 UTC,"Surely this isn't the best song on the album but it has some great moments. Josh's vocals are the best what this track has to offer, my favourite line being Cause you're the soup du'jour. that's for sure.  Overall a very enjoyable track if you're in mood for it."
qotsa,2xk5gc,RegularPhil,2,Sun Mar 1 14:35:13 2015 UTC,"Do not even get me started on this song. The way it opens with that sexy sexy riff, Jesus. Then Josh's vocals. This motherfucker sings everywhere from slanky and creepy to fucked-up falsetto as his own backup. Not to mention John's INSANE talent coming through on this song. He kills it on this track. Dave, I mean he's a fucking legend. He really shines here by just going ape. That's all he needed to do and Christ did he do it.   Overall, 10/10; my 6th favourite song of all time (3rd favourite Vultures song, behind Elephants and Scumbag Blues)."
qotsa,2xk5gc,notactuallyjoshhomme,2,Mon Mar 2 02:36:21 2015 UTC,"Some of the best lyrics Josh has every written, as far as I'm concerned. And the music is incredibly unique. One of the most enduring songs off of the album."

She met Richard File (of U.N.K.L.E. fame) at Rancho de la Luna and they formed We Fell To Earth.  The U.N.K.L.E./QOTSA association goes without saying here, I'd think. Obviously they're all friends and collaborate very frequently.

qotsa,2xc44d,dankyflam,4,Fri Feb 27 19:54:18 2015 UTC,"Is that really classic Queens not having the title track on an album? I see this case but can't think of any others, unless you count Lullabies to Paralyze (which I don't since it's a lyric, not a song name)   Edit: good call with the synth melody from ""make it wit chu"", I didn't realize till I went back and listened to the end of the song.

Josh is famously secretive about his sound, but I feel like a good, middy fuzz combined with a semi hollow or hollow body guitar will get you pretty close. If you have the funds, I know Josh uses an ampeg vt-40 and troy uses a vox ac50 iirc.   Edit: this has some amp settings actually used on their tour for both Troy and Josh, and goes into some detail about Troy's rig. You might find some better answers here.   http://www.premierguitar.com/articles/19577-rig-rundown-queens-of-the-stone-ages-troy-van-leeuwen?page=1"

qotsa,2xaa5f,zingo-spleen,1 point,Fri Feb 27 00:02:53 2015 UTC,I used to play with just a Big Muff into a cheap Fender bass amp and got a pretty good early-Queens/Kyuss stoner kind of sound.

qotsa,2xaa5f,rapemybones,6,Thu Feb 26 23:01:00 2015 UTC,"This, don't forget to put heavy strings on, and as another mentioned he now plays almost exclusively on hollow-body or semi guitars. Combine with a good tune amp like an Orange, and last but not least, don't learn Josh's songs so much as learn to play the way Josh plays, that's the hardest part, but you can't do a Pentatonic solo on many Queens songs without sounding like a Kids Bop imposter, it just doesn't work."
qotsa,2xaa5f,TheDeaf,10,Thu Feb 26 23:13:00 2015 UTC,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJDUHq2mJx0  In regards to learning how to play the way Josh plays this video is a really good starting point.

qotsa,2xaa5f,jlight119,2,Fri Feb 27 15:32:20 2015 UTC,"I was surprised when I read that Josh apparently uses 12s or 13s for C since the heavy, stoner/desert/doom song has always worked best for me with light strings, fuzz and organ rupturing amounts of bass."
qotsa,2xaa5f,jlight119,1 point,Fri Feb 27 20:12:19 2015 UTC,I believe they use 11s for standard and 12s for C.
qotsa,2xaa5f,Wizard-in--Black,2,Mon Mar 2 01:24:04 2015 UTC,"Oh alright. I know that Troy uses 12-56/58 or something like that for C, but I remember reading that Josh used 13s somewhere (something about what he used in his Kyuss days iirc), but I could be misremembering.   Edit: specified the tuning for those gauges."
qotsa,2xaa5f,BinaryChode,1 point,Mon Mar 2 04:11:30 2015 UTC,"Oh, maybe I was thinking of Troy. I thought he said they both do but maybe not. Josh definitely could have switched since Kyuss though."

qotsa,2xaa5f,ajemond,1 point,Fri Feb 27 02:31:44 2015 UTC,"From what I've found, it's 75% in the amp. The rest is in your fingers and all the magic stuff that certain guitars have when you touch them. I have a non master volume VT22 and a V3. The V3 crushes that tone at a much more reasonable volume than the VT22/V4. You could also grab one of the V2's with the master volume distortion circuit for a quick and painless (and awesome) solution. The non master volume V2 would also work but you'd need an attenuator or a gain pedal. Ampegs are great for the way they can handle almost every kind of effect you throw at them with crystal clarity. FWIW the VT40 is the combo version of the V2, and the VT22 is the combo version of the V4. If you can find a B25 you can have a tech modify it to V3 specs. Attenuators are a must for bedroom levels, and they also serve to help you get the amp to the point that it breaks up. You'll wear the power tubes quicker, but that's not the worst thing in the world. From there it's all in how you tweak the tone knobs on the amp. If you can't afford a new amp or don't have the patience or know-how to wait for one to pop up on the used market, Dimarzio Super II's or any other low-medium output ceramic humbuckers will get you part way there. You could also try Catalinbread's SFT pedal, which is said to be a pretty good emulation of Ampeg distortion. The dude from Red Fang used one pedal when I saw them live and it was an SFT."
qotsa,2xaa5f,yolorelli,1 point,Fri Feb 27 01:56:04 2015 UTC,"It's all in the fingers! They have used a tonne of different effects over the years, so there is no 'Queens secret'. That said, a Morley Fuzz/Wah/Boost type thing will get you pretty close."
qotsa,2xaa5f,Rockefor,1 point,Fri Feb 27 02:04:28 2015 UTC,I've been using the SFT from Catalinbread and it really nails the tone. Fairly hot humbuckers and a clean amp and play with lots of attitude!
qotsa,2xaa5f,AppearMissing,1 point,Fri Feb 27 04:27:39 2015 UTC,Boss turbo overdrive.  Heavy on the mids. Roll the tone knob back the whole way on your guitar. Kinda gives it that throaty sound.
qotsa,2xaa5f,TakemebacktoCali,1 point,Fri Feb 27 05:44:26 2015 UTC,Make sure the guitar is tuned down to C.
qotsa,2xaa5f,bluewafflebreakfast,1 point,Fri Feb 27 12:02:30 2015 UTC,I play my Epi Lucille through a Moog MF drive through an ampeg micro cl bass amp and I get pretty close to Josh's sound. The Moog is a great pedal that's very versatile if you plan and experimenting as well as having his sound.

Bullshitted with him the drummer Dean for a while after a show once. The song 'For The Sake Of Argument' is pure Queens. But I think there's tons of original tones and progressions in this new album.   White Orange is another project of Dustin's too. Check them out if you like this.

Picking up right from Songs For The Deaf straight into two new records. The touring was relentless. It was non-stop. I think we all love that. It's fun to be creative and be working and keeping something like that moving. But after a while it really starts to beat you down. We all kind of knew it was the time to step away for a second."" http://www.musicradar.com/news/drums/joey-castillo-talks-punishing-schedules-with-qotsa-and-eagles-of-death-metal-566667/            Josh's POV: Homme, meanwhile, hints that differences, musical or otherwise, forced them apart. “Friends are people who have parallel interests,” he says matter-of-factly, “and I gave up being upset when someone’s life takes a different direction long ago. It’s not a reflection of what I’m doing or what they’re doing, it’s just the way it is.” While other bandmates would smash up their instruments and vow never to speak again, Homme looks at it a little more philosophically: “If you’re friends with somebody and you don’t wanna make music with them anymore because of the different paths you have to take, you should be able to still be friends.” http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/4146486-i-wish-there-was-a-different-story-to-tell-josh-homme-talks-to-dis"

From what I understand, Josh had a demo that probably had a stuff from the first Desert Sessions that he gave to labels. McBain was playing with Queens at gigs and stuff from 97 or 98. Before the band released the first split. McBain left before that was issued, but contributed to both ""Regular John"" and ""Avon"". The guy is a God... I mean, who here didn't get into QOTSA from ""Regular John""? And yet not listed or credited anywhere. Very humble, amazingly talented guy."

You've certainly got all the side projects down, apart from Desert Sessions 1 - 8, but I guess you realised that given you have 9 & 10.  There's too many missing tracks to list, I can think of a few of the key ones off the top of my head, though:  18 AD  Infinity (2000 and 2005 versions)  The Fun Machine Took a Shit and Died  Era Vulgaris  Nobody To Love  Those tracks are only scratching the surface though, as there's also a shit tonne of remixes, live cover versions, alternate versions, demos, guest spots on other people's albums and general oddities.  A lot of them wouldn't be on google play though so it's not surprising they're not on that list.

qotsa,2w6evu,bmcnult19,8,Tue Feb 17 09:25:42 2015 UTC,"...Like Clockwork on vinyl too. Why is it in 45 rpm format?   It's because it actually improves sound quality.  Allegedly 45 rpm sounds better than than 33/3 rpm.  There are only a couple of tracks per side because a) the more space there is between the grooves the better it sounds and b) you can only fit a fairly small amount of music on a 45 rpm record.  It might be slightly inconvenient but it makes the album sound a lot better and it pays off, because it's a top sounding record.  It's nothing new that EV sounds poor.  It's not really their fault that it skips, though.  That's just a pressing fault and they happen sometimes.    It's not their fault that you have an auto cueing deck that doesn't work with 10""s.  It is true that it sound fairly poor though."
qotsa,2w6evu,Wizard-in--Black,1 point,Tue Feb 17 11:18:18 2015 UTC,"Does it really sound better if the grooves are farther apart? It seems like that might be true up to the point where there's no possibility of the grooves ""deflecting"" because of thinness if you know what I mean."
qotsa,2w6evu,Wizard-in--Black,2,Tue Feb 17 20:04:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, groove spacing does definitely make a noticeable difference on sound quality.  Compare an album with 30 mins on one side of vinyl with one that has 8 - 12 mins on one side.  The latter will sound noticeably superior and that is down in a big way to the spacing of the grooves."
qotsa,2w6evu,jaycfresh,1 point,Tue Feb 17 23:30:43 2015 UTC,Does anyone have an explanation as to why that is?
qotsa,2w6evu,ninger6,4,Tue Feb 17 23:44:20 2015 UTC,"I always thought the reason was because of resolution. You're storing one second of audio on .75 revolutions with a 45rpm vs .55 revolutions on a 33rpm. That's 36% more data for the same amount of time. Higher resolution. Also, albums on 45s tend to use thicker and higher quality vinyl. Unfortunately, a bad pressing means none of that means shit anyway."
qotsa,2w6evu,bjisba41,1 point,Wed Feb 18 07:03:23 2015 UTC,"No I get that, but why does the spacing between the grooves matter?  It seems like grove spacing and better audio is a matter of correlation without causation.  Like records with farther apart grooves are usually made without much consideration for how much music can fit on a disk and more consideration for audio fidelity so by nature they sound better."

I don't have a quality record player to buy expensive vinyl for, but I also like physical packaging, so I buy CDs. I thought the art for LC was fantastic and I thought the CD booklet would contain more pictures similar to the vinyl release. I thought it would have lyrics. Nope! All there is is a slip of paper redirecting to the website for full credits. The same slip of paper is also redundantly printed under the disc tray. I'm not sure what they're going for, because if they're trying to be environmentally friendly, it was also packaged in a cardboard slip case printed with THE EXACT SAME DESIGN AS THE CD CASE ITSELF.  IIRC, the Era Vulgaris disc does the same thing. It redirects to the website for extended credits, however I can't look them up because it's been replaced with the LC credits.  TL;DR Complaining about packaging."

qotsa,2w6evu,paddypatronus,5,Wed Feb 18 04:39:39 2015 UTC,"Sounds to me you don't like vinyl in general so I'm not sure what all this is about. Yes, the sound is bad on this release but it sounds like there are a lot of other issues at play here.    Why is ... Like Clockwork 45rpm instead of 33? Probably because 45 offers higher fidelity then 33. And if changing discs/sides is an issue for you, I'm not sure why you're using vinyl It's not 12"" so you have to set the needle manually? I don't see how this is an issue. Again that has more to do with your turn table itself than anything else The audio cuts out from left to right at random? We'll if it's truly at random than it's and issue with your turn table/set up. If it messes up in the same spot each time then you vinyl was pressed wrong and the place it was bought from will most likely return/exchange it hole drilled out of the center so your tone are is dancing? I'm assuming this means you need a sizing adapter like most 7"" discs. Most new tables come with these. The tone are is dancing because it's not centered because the adapter is missing. This is also most likely why the audio is cutting out left/right. This is also really bad to do repeatedly for the vinyl and your needle."
qotsa,2w6evu,ruinedoverout,1 point,Tue Feb 17 22:05:10 2015 UTC,"To your last point, this particular release has small center holes. So the adapter is not the problem at all."
qotsa,2w6evu,ninger6,-1,Wed Feb 18 04:40:47 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna go in reverse order   It's got a small hole, not a 1.5 inch or so hole like is usually on 45s (as they're commonly called, otherwise known as singles or 7"" disks).  I'm insulted you'd think I'd play something like a 45 without an adapter and then complain the hole isn't center.  Jesus dude I'm not that stupid. It doesn't so much cut out as get quieter on one side or the other.  I didn't say it was random, just for no apparent reason.  I've heard it's common with era vulgaris vinyls.  And it's the same place.  Never happened on any other records. The 10 inch vs. 12 inch thing is just annoying for me because I keep pressing ""start"" and then the needle scratches on the bare section of the turntable because I'm tired as fuck and don't remember.  Is there an advantage to 10 inches? Why not just do a 12 inch like most other records? That's all.  It just seems like qotsa or their management are trying to be different just for the sake of being different.  LC being in 45 RPM actually has advantages.  EV being on a 10 inch doesn't (that I know of). I was in a shitty mood and took it out on ...Like Clockwork which is a fine album and didn't deserve it.  It still seems like qotsa or their management or whoever makes the records is being different for the sake of being different.  Why not put all the other albums in 45 RPM for the higher fidelity?  Self Titled has 14 songs, is in 33-1/3 rpm, and is two disks.  I couldn't be happier with it."
qotsa,2w6evu,darkkite23,3,Tue Feb 17 22:32:08 2015 UTC,"I mean, you can be insulted if you want I guess, never called you stupid, only trying to touch on the points in your original post since it sounds like there's a lot more going on. I have the Era Vulgaris vinyl and I honestly couldn't remember if it needed the 45 adapter because I listened to it once years ago and never looked at it since. I have however, not had any of the other issues you've listed so here we go  -If the hole is smaller then the standard size then this is mostly likely why the audio cuts out from right to left. If there is any wiggle room then the vinyl won't stay perfectly centered and the needle will scrape the inside of the groove and cause this to happen. I would simply try and return it.   -There is no advantage to 10"" that I've ever heard. Here's the thing though, most people who grew up with turn tables didn't have one that came with an automatic arm, it was a featured reserved for really high end players. That's why the sizes of the discs were less of an issue because most people were setting their needle by hand anyways. I get that mistakes happen but for the sake of your needle you really can't ""forget"" that it's a 10"" instead of a 12"" because it's incredibly bad for your needle to be dragged across the empty platter. It will bend your needle eventually and cause a lot of problems for your needle, your vinyl, and ultimately you. I've bent a needle or two over the years so I know just how fragile they can be.   -...Like Clockwork and Era Vulgaris were released by different record companies at very different times. Era Vulgaris was a few years before vinyl made a comeback, so it was packaged and sold pretty much exclusively as a quick cash grab from super fans. My theory for making it 3x10"" is so they could add perceived value for the sticker price. They used automated machines to cut a master copy from digital files instead of hiring a sound engineer to take the analog masters from tape and cutting a REAL master copy by hand. They also didn't care about quality control because almost no one at the time would ACTUALLY be listening to it on vinyl at the time.   -In order for them to repress the other albums in 45rpm they would have to hire someone to created a new master copy at 45rpms and go through that whole process, which isn't exactly cheap. They also probably feel like there isn't much money to be made from re-issues, especially when the band is no longer attached to that label.  -Do Queens want to be different? I'm sure they do, but artists in most record contracts have a very small amount of control of packaging and formats outside of the actual artwork. Sure, they could bring an idea to their label, but most times the label has final say on the physical product. The self titled re-issue was released by Rekords Rekords, which is Josh's label. The self titled is probably the only album he has publishing rights to."
qotsa,2w6evu,notactuallyjoshhomme,0,Tue Feb 17 23:15:24 2015 UTC,"The hole is just the regular size that fits on the shaft.  It does not wiggle.  There is no room for that.  If you search ""Era Vulgaris vinyl"" in this sub, there's a recent post by someone else complaining of the same issues with the stereo recording...  Eh I don't know about that.  My grandpa has a regular ass record player from the 70s or so that has an automatic arm.  And either way it doesn't really matter what people who grew up with them are used to because you can't buy a good new record player without the automatic arm... And EV came out in 2007. And 10s haven't been regularly used since shellac was replaced by vinyl.  And trust me I'm not trying to forget about the size difference.  I don't want a bent needle any more than the next guy.  That's disappointing to say the least.  I just meant why didn't they make the masters in 45 to begin with?  I guess because people are more worried about fidelity now again."

I'm not looking to argue about your grandpa's record player, but even looking at the current market of tables, it's STILL a feature reserved for higher priced tables so my point still stands.   45rpm wasn't the standard because 33 1/3 offers longer play time on single discs. When radio stations were still playing songs off vinyl, it was a pretty big deal to make everything fit on one disc so the longer run time was a much bigger deal."

qotsa,2w4pm5,zoso27,15,Wed Feb 18 02:48:33 2015 UTC,"I think at the earliest, we'd get it in October. At latest, late next year. I think Josh deserves a break after all of the work that went into ...Like Clockwork. Dean might be busy with The Dead Weather, and isn't Troy's band doing something right now?  Also, unrelated, but the next album will be the first one entirely drummed by Jon Theodore. Thinking about that makes me happy."
qotsa,2w4pm5,UniformRecon,7,Tue Feb 17 01:23:30 2015 UTC,Plus Mikey is busy with Mini Mansions right now
qotsa,2w4pm5,BURN-THE-WITCH,2,Tue Feb 17 04:57:15 2015 UTC,Jon was in Joshua tree last week
qotsa,2w4pm5,PamplemousseHole,2,Sat Feb 21 21:19:12 2015 UTC,"Shit yeah. Jon being present early in the writing process should light a fire under everyone's ass, creatively. I'm not saying they need it, just saying it should make for something special."
qotsa,2w4pm5,gnice3d,8,Sat Feb 21 23:52:58 2015 UTC,"Well before the 6 (or 4, if you count Them Crooked Vultures) year hiatus, Josh put out an album every two or three years.  More if you count the Desert Sessions, EODM etc.  The four year hiatus between TCV and the ...LC was mainly down to the knee operation complications and depression that followed.  ...LC was the band's biggest selling album since SFTD and they toured extensively to support it so I'm fairly confident that they're not going to wait too long to record another album, what with all the fans the band has gained over the last two years.  Having said that, Josh has made numerous empty promises about recording various albums before (Desert Sessions 11 & 12, anyone?) so I wouldn't get my hopes up.  Also, fully finishing and releasing an album takes time and even if they did begin recording in September, we probably wouldn't see it until Q1 2016 at least."
qotsa,2w4pm5,Wizard-in--Black,4,Tue Feb 17 00:11:45 2015 UTC,Probably not until next year. it seems like josh is the only one free right now. I have a feeling there might be a chance for TCV to record this year though.

qotsa,2w4pm5,FapManGoo,3,Tue Feb 17 16:23:17 2015 UTC,Didn't Josh say that he has a bunch of stuff written that wasn't recorded for ...Like Clockwork? We may get it sooner than we think.
qotsa,2w4pm5,mikerastiello,1 point,Tue Feb 17 17:24:39 2015 UTC,No he did not say that.
qotsa,2w4pm5,BinaryChode,5,Tue Feb 17 20:09:39 2015 UTC,"We have more than enough songs. We're booked til September, but after that we plan to jump in the studio and get going.   He told that to Rolling Stone in January 2014."
qotsa,2w4pm5,mikerastiello,1 point,Tue Feb 17 20:49:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah and then he revised that to after the oct 31 2014 show he was talking time off, and the start of 2015 he would be getting in the studio for a special project. Also said queens wouldn't be likely till the later part of 2015. Also read an article with Al and he said pretty much all songs for like clockwork were used, there was no hoard of songs left over."
qotsa,2w4pm5,BinaryChode,4,Tue Feb 17 20:59:39 2015 UTC,"Damn son, give them a bit more time.  ...Like Clockwork came out like last year."

qotsa,2w4pm5,PleaseNoLetMeGo,2,Tue Feb 17 04:10:23 2015 UTC,Mini Mansions have announced dates up until mid June. They'll presumably add more when the album is announced properly. There's a new EODM album on the way. Sweethead released a single recently so there could be an album in the works there too. I wouldn't be surprised if we didn't hear from Queens for a couple of years tbh.
qotsa,2w4pm5,adrian1897,1 point,Tue Feb 17 12:34:09 2015 UTC,"Well, they're playing Rock en Rio in September so...I think there's a chance we may hear a new song then as promotion for a new album. Didn't they do the same thing with Lollapalooza two years ago? Release ""My God is the Sun"" during the concert?"
qotsa,2w4pm5,thewisefoolHHH,2,Tue Feb 17 11:42:34 2015 UTC,They also spent about 4 summers before that playing festivals with no new material.

qotsa,2w4pm5,BadMemory71,1 point,Thu Feb 19 06:51:20 2015 UTC,"I want to say they'll be doing it this new, releasing end of this year or early next year, but given that most QotSA members are side-projecting at the moment and Eagles of Death Metal are probably going to do their new album this year it'll be a while.  On a side note: it's been, like, 12 years since the last Desert Sessions. Given how many more awesome musicians Josh has befriended since then, when they do eventually do a new one (or two), it's gonna be so fucking good it'll hurt."

It was imo the best portuguese festival, it was really near the beach, and it was really near the camping spots, you could actually get the full festival experience. They unfortunately moved it back to the center of Lisbon, and it lost it's spirit. Anyways, I really loved this bass recording, and the fact that I was there helps me into making a decision to choose this as my fave live version."

Some of my favorite Queens lyrics, and the final instrumental segment is littered with some truly haunting melodies. Lullabies is my favorite Queens album and this song encapsulates its sound perfectly."

qotsa,2vyy8j,Wheelkiller,5,Sun Feb 15 15:13:18 2015 UTC,"absolutely, without a doubt, my favorite track by qotsa and my favorite song of all time. this is one that i can never skip when it comes on. i recently had the line ""every breath an art"" tattooed onto my arm, it means a lot to me on a personal level as well as being pulled from an all-time favorite.  lullabies is also, imo, #1 for qotsa albums"

qotsa,2vyy8j,Count_Critic,3,Mon Feb 16 05:28:44 2015 UTC,"Definitely one of QOTSA's darkest songs.  It's got an ominous, almost claustrophobic, riff and that 3/4 intro is quite spooky.  It's also one of my all time favorite songs by them; I love the way it continuously pushes forward with that riff and amazing, smooth vocal line until a breakdown halfway through.  This and Someone's in the Wolf are the album's two masterpieces and represent Queens at their darkest and best."
qotsa,2vyy8j,Wizard-in--Black,4,Sun Feb 15 15:34:03 2015 UTC,One of my absolute favourite songs. I think these are some of Josh's most beautiful lyrics. The remix is pretty cool too: http://youtu.be/v-wKRkvrryg

qotsa,2vyy8j,1ird,3,Sun Feb 15 19:41:34 2015 UTC,"I used to hate this song when I first got into Queens, but the more I listened to it, the more I adored how it droned on and on with some of Josh's best lyrics almost muffled underneath a barrage of nonstop guitars.  Like OP said, this and Someone's in the Wolf really drove home the overall theme for Lullabies for me.  A bit off kilter, heavy as fuck, sexy, and very dark."
qotsa,2vyy8j,Approval_Guy,2,Mon Feb 16 05:01:33 2015 UTC,So dark and beautiful. And the bit where the music stops then kicks in again is like a kick to the fucking face!

PJ and QOTSA are my favorite bands so I had to make the trip from outside Boston for this.  Both nights Eddie came out for cowbell nirvana.  The Strokes also played that weekend and he came out for one of their songs too.  Josh and Strokes Guy came out for Pearl Jam songs later in the evening.  Strokes Guy couldn't even get Not For You right, belting out part of Jeremy midway through.    Josh came out for a 15 year old B-Side that had NEVER been played live by Pearl Jam before and knocked it out of the fucking park.  The juxtaposition between 5'7"" baritone EV and 6'4"" falsetto Homme is pretty amazing.  In The Moonlight - Pearl Jam with Josh Homme"

qotsa,2vp6in,picketyp,3,Fri Feb 13 01:28:00 2015 UTC,That's actually the only reason I listen to this song. Those horns are the closest thing to the Era Vulgaris song on the album.
qotsa,2vp6in,matthalius,6,Fri Feb 13 02:23:25 2015 UTC,I love those. Nice segway into the next song when listening to the album in full.

qotsa,2vp6in,paddypatronus,3,Fri Feb 13 02:41:18 2015 UTC,on its own i dig it but i mean if i were to play all their songs in a row the end of Teenage Hand Model (and the horn outro to Headache tbh) would be the only bits that I'd skip over
qotsa,2vp6in,kittyqotsa,1 point,Fri Feb 13 03:27:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah the interludes at the end of songs like that kinda kill the momentum when i have queens on shuffle.

qotsa,2vp6in,frankieh,2,Sat Feb 14 11:04:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah I just heard it now and Josh's voice does sound a little strained in it. The thing about the album version is just that it's a pretty big shift when it gets to the chorus, and I just really liked the riff that was playing. I just think the chorus is a little weaker than the rest, and so are Josh's vocals during that part (imo)."
qotsa,2vp6in,paddypatronus,7,Sun Feb 15 01:15:13 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna have to go with the main riff in ""Burn the Witch"" it just sounds too much like a Black Keys song or something, doesn't  have the typical cool Queens-y sound."
qotsa,2vp6in,adrian1897,11,Sun Feb 15 12:00:50 2015 UTC,"It's Queens riffing on ZZ Top, which is cool because Billy Gibbons played slide on that song. It's a fucking great line."

qotsa,2vp6in,xxANGRY_AARDVARKxx,1 point,Mon Feb 16 15:56:58 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say that it predates their sound. Their sound is more of a constantly changing thing.
qotsa,2vp6in,koizoizhick,5,Thu Feb 12 23:16:59 2015 UTC,I think he meant it predates the Black Keys sound
qotsa,2vp6in,ajgmaison,3,Fri Feb 13 00:15:41 2015 UTC,You are totally right! My bad for misreading.
qotsa,2vp6in,OneManArmy96,1 point,Fri Feb 13 01:13:40 2015 UTC,"Haha I was talking about the Black Keys sound, no worries though. I think judging by when this album came out vs. Brothers (which I consider the album that defined their sound), Burn the Witch predates it. Having said that I also think it sounds similar XD"
qotsa,2vp6in,Inner_west,2,Fri Feb 13 02:53:56 2015 UTC,True. But i always hate that a song is over. Especially a good one. Which these guys have nothing but.
qotsa,2vp6in,maxtheshocker,2,Fri Feb 13 04:11:00 2015 UTC,I'm not a huge fan of the chorus in 3's & 7's. I think it may be a combination of the rhythm guitar tone and the slide guitar.  The verse is so great in that song that I always feel the chorus is a let down.
qotsa,2vp6in,1ird,2,Sat Feb 14 00:46:45 2015 UTC,"I like all of the moments, but my least favourite would be Long Slow Goodbye. I have personal reasons, I went through bad break up and whenever I hear the song I get all sentimental and lose my manliness.  EDIT: It's a killer tune, I fucking love it but I hate it."

qotsa,2vgyyh,rapemybones,2,Wed Feb 11 22:31:41 2015 UTC,So early that he started the second verse a few measures too early.
qotsa,2vgyyh,C909,7,Wed Feb 11 02:16:00 2015 UTC,"It could be that the song was written that way back then; clearly a lot of that performance, besides the 2nd verse, has changed.   Unless you were joking, in which case, ""Lol"" would suffice. I did think it sounded kind of cool hearing lyrics over one of my favorite iconic Queens riffs like that. It almost sounded like a mash up."

It's not one of their most incredible songs, but it's dead solid.  Great bass line and riff, the flamenco break in awesome and personally I've always loved the lyrics on this one.  And Josh's vocals fucking kick ass.  End of."

qotsa,2v2fzl,maxtheshocker,4,Sat Feb 7 05:43:13 2015 UTC,"As far as the arrangement goes: I think your lead singer should exchange his acoustic guitar for an electric, and play the rhythm throughout the song. The lead guitarist should play the solo and a bit of lead stuff over the choruses (as well as the harmonics in the intro and second verse).   The drummer was good. The bassist was great. The lead singer had fantastic stage presence and the keys player was good too. I noticed a mic in front of the bass player, it would be cool to have both him and the keys player singing 'I wanna make it, I wanna make it wit chu' in the chorus to give it some added depth.  But overall it was a pretty good rendition of the song and I'd give it a solid 7/10."

qotsa,2utu4m,Akaforty,1 point,Sat Feb 7 16:32:21 2015 UTC,"I clipped it from the track here.  It really surprised me at first, since it does sound like an old clock or clock tower between the last two hat hits and all the instruments kicking in.  It however also sounds like the lead guitar, I think it's the same note, so I'm inclined to believe that it's the note resonating a bit from the pressure before actually being played.  Or we could just make a super God out of Josh and say that he recorded a clock tower and built the track around it in the same key."
qotsa,2usjtz,absolut3go,8,Wed Feb 4 20:37:07 2015 UTC,They are probably using a volume pedal.  Both Josh and Troy have them on their boards.  I don't think I've seen either of them do swells with the volume knob.  I suppose it could have been done in the mix but a volume pedal is definitely the easiest way to do it.

qotsa,2usjtz,2tidesaday,1 point,Wed Feb 4 23:31:08 2015 UTC,Very true.  Whenever I head Queens I picture troy so I always assume he's playing on the records.  Except the first one actually.  They are somewhat not Troy's style.
qotsa,2usjtz,notaaronwells,2,Thu Feb 5 01:08:28 2015 UTC,"I dont believe its a pedal or anything used. I think it was done within the mix with a whitenoise synth or it could have been the works of an autovolume knob that gives the ""swelling"" or ""fluttering"" sound."
qotsa,2usjtz,djimmi,2,Wed Feb 4 21:04:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah it depends on wether you're talking about live or in a recording. Live a volume pedal is the way to go, recording I would automate the swells. But this has all been said."

As usual with QOTSA singles, it's not their deepest or most adventurous song, but it's catchy as hell and a real rocker.  The structure is conventional and the chorus is simple, but it all falls together to make a really great 'straight ahead' rock song.  I personally have always preferred it both FGHOTS and Monsters in the Parasol, but that's just personal. Rated R is my favorite QOTSA album and although this is far from the best track on the album, it's still great fun."

In a lot of interviews, josh has said the goal with that song was to tap into his lve for dark, pop, but still rock songs. And hes a fuckin master when it comes to writing tunes and making them feel ""bored"" or lethargic (see: You Would Know, You've Got A Killer Scene.., etc.). The song is like an angry whisper during the verses, then goes into this howling WHATEVER YOU DOOOOOOOO, dont tell anyone... but its almost sarcastic, like whoever the subject of the song is cant keep a secret for shit.  While lost art is way more upbeat i think, its delivery was meant to be flat and fuzzy and blankets your ears instead of attacking it with the midrange bite qotsa usually have that punches right through the mix."

I've heard nothing but good things about the original 2002 pressings of SFTD.  The red vinyl US pressing is supposed to sound excellent, and the black vinyl UK pressing is apparently not far behind, though it is slightly inferior, hence the cheaper going rate.  I've also heard very positive things about the boot reissue.  A lot of people say it sounds really great.  If you really want a copy and aren't fussed about collectability, I'd recommend going for that one.  Having said that, I'd be very surprised if we didn't get an official reissue within the next 12 months given the demand for the album on vinyl (which is massive), so I'd hold out for that myself.

It's the band's best known album but yet it's the only one that's not officially in print.  Hell, even a less popular album like LTP is easily available, but yet no sign of a SFTD reissue.  Why?  When the semi-regular ""what album do you most want to see back in press"" discussion comes up on /r/vinyl, SFTD always gets mentioned multiple times.  It baffles me that they haven't cashed in on the vinyl resurgence and put it back in print yet.  Music on Vinyl would do a great job."

All I said was that LTP (along with Era Vulgaris) one of their least commercially successful albums, selling far less than SFTD ever did, which makes the album much less popular album than SFTD.  LTP is also a much less critically acclaimed album than SFTD (LTP scores 78 while SFTD scores 89) and it's just generally one of their least popular albums.  That's not an opinion, it's a non debatable fact.  I never said anything whatsoever about my own opinion on the album, which is very high.  I think it's a fantastic album, and I actually prefer it to Songs for the Deaf."
qotsa,2ucpkm,pms233,0,Wed Feb 4 20:27:21 2015 UTC,"So you're telling me that sites such as Metacritic and Pitchfork aren't OPINIONATED reviews? You also didnt state that Lullabies was their ""least commercially successful album"", you literally said ""one of their least popular albums"". Josh Homme, and QOTSA have not REFUSED to reissue SFTD, it has to do with record deals with IPECAC and jumping through legal hoops to acquire the master recordings of SFTD (which IPECAC owns). Your responses were uneducated so yes, I was a mild dick by saying your opinion was shitty, however ""opinions are like assholes, everyone has one and they all stink"""

qotsa,2u118y,Jefersonthepisces,2,Thu Jan 29 00:55:24 2015 UTC,"I felt the majority of the solo's on Youtube were either marginally improvised or just not coherent to the original solo, so I want to try and play it as accurately as possible.  Besides some sexy noise/feedback, specific slidings Homme does, and his bad ass sound, I think this is just right."

qotsa,2u118y,theojhair,1 point,Thu Jan 29 02:11:16 2015 UTC,Really awesome! How did you get the tone? it's dead on.
qotsa,2u118y,theojhair,3,Fri Jan 30 10:28:32 2015 UTC,"The tone came from having the mids up, the treble and bass down a bit, the gain not being too overpowering (although Homme's solos seem to have a bit more distortion in comparison to just the rhythm riffs), and tinkering around with a wah pedal. You leave the wah pedal clicked on at a certain point in the foot, and that's what gives that gnarly nasal sound. I imagine a better wah pedal that can broaden that nasal range would give a more accurate sound, but I work with what I have."
qotsa,2twr89,daebat,6,Wed Jan 28 01:10:12 2015 UTC,What I found cool was Nick was doing the screaming in Song for the Deaf a few feet back from the mic @ 58:04-58:28. It's such a minor layer to the song but the fact that he did it live is awesome

qotsa,2tnz4e,Nauje,2,Wed Jan 28 22:31:23 2015 UTC,"Haha DEFINITELY a few mess-ups - I flibbed a couple lyrics, my tone didn't come out as Homme-esque as I hoped, and a few lead lines didn't hit the mark.  I'll chalk it up to adrenaline, I suppose - QOTSA stuff is sneaky hard to play, but we rehearsed a ton.  The Great Cover Up has been going on in Champaign, IL since 1990.  Basically, 25-30 local bands each prepare a full set as another band.  Some go all out with costumes, etc.  Now it's up to FIVE nights at a local venue called the HighDive.  One of the cooler elements is that the crowd AND fellow bands don't know who's covering who.  It was a thrill to hear a few in the crowd scream when they hear 'K-L-O-N . . . the KLONE!!!!' and knew we were Queens.  With us, since we're a two-guitar band, QOTSA felt like a natural choice.  For ""costumes"", we had our 2nd guitarist do the ""Troy"" thing, bassist went shirtless and taped on Nick-esque facial hair, and the drummer straightened and darkened his hair for the Grohl look.  Sure, that formation never played 3's and 7's, but what the hell haha."

Local bands prepare a full set as another band, so for our first go-round at the Cover-Up we went with Queens.  Hope you enjoy, and comments are welcome!  Apart from a few noticeable flubs, I think we did the music of QOTSA proud (at least I hope so, because they've been a big influence on all of us as musicians).

qotsa,2tm1wa,mcmahon212,8,Sun Jan 25 15:11:32 2015 UTC,The perfect closer to this album. The simple upbeat piano compliments the strange sounds so fucking well. I would go as far to say this is the best closer to a QOTSA album yet.
qotsa,2tm1wa,Mr_vindictive,3,Sun Jan 25 15:40:41 2015 UTC,"Love this song. It is different and unique. It also works in the message from Oliveri so it holds some band history as well.   My dog always goes nuts at the end of the song with the ""noises""."
qotsa,2tm1wa,Wizard-in--Black,3,Sun Jan 25 19:18:45 2015 UTC,"What I love about it is that it's a complete one-off in the whole QOTSA catalogue.  It's got this weird, hazy, tripped-up kind of vibe the lyrics are some of Josh's best.  They're some of his most meaningful while also being very ambiguous.   How many QOTSA songs have piano as their lead instrument?  A couple of on LC (though they're completely different to this one) but other than that there's nothing.  It's a very overlooked song, and that's a real shame."
qotsa,2tm1wa,ZouTiger026,2,Sun Jan 25 19:35:35 2015 UTC,"Not many, and they've mostly been on later albums. I think that's why I like it so much. It's just such a radical departure from the rest of the early material, but ties the first album together so nicely. Mosquito Song is similar in that regard, but Hand Model isn't even close to being as dramatic as Mosquito Song. It's the soundtrack to a hangover, you know? Don't play too loud because my head might just explode."
qotsa,2tm1wa,OneManArmy96,2,Tue Jan 27 16:11:11 2015 UTC,This used to be my alarm. When i first heard the STA none of the songs really stuck with me (now i know all of them by heart) except for this one. Definitely one of my favorites.
qotsa,2tm1wa,conrocket,2,Sun Jan 25 20:30:31 2015 UTC,"One of my favorites. In the transcript for the lyrics you might want to add the ""Oooo"" just so people unfamiliar with the song can see the chorus breaks. I think this song was a glimpse of the songwriting we would later see on ...like clockwork. It seems like a transition from Kyuss to modern QotSA."
qotsa,2tm1wa,KoA07,2,Mon Jan 26 03:15:22 2015 UTC,I like that the bass is like the melodic instrument on the choruses and it does that neat little thing at the end.

Fun fact: the day before I turned 20, my friend did a drawing of my hand while I wasn't noticing.  We were at his brother's band practice just kicking it.  The next day he sees me and hands me a large piece of paper that he does charcoal drawings on (forgive me artists, I don't know what it's properly called).  I look at it to find a picture of my hand with ""I Was A Teenage Hand Model"" written right under it."

qotsa,2tb7hn,oseri,12,Sun Jan 25 15:20:50 2015 UTC,Blood Red Shoes is like a 2 person Arctic Monkeys.   Band of Skulls is heavy blues-rock.    Sleater-Kinney is an indie/punk band that has their guitars tuned down.     Ty Segall is a garage rock musician and is about as active as Josh Homme.
qotsa,2tb7hn,goshdangittoheck,3,Thu Jan 22 19:58:21 2015 UTC,"Thank you for mentioning Blood Red Shoes! I listened to them on Spotify, and I must say, they are brilliant! Consider yourself a spreader of fantastic music!"
qotsa,2tb7hn,odaal,2,Fri Jan 23 20:55:29 2015 UTC,Band of Skulls is one of my favorite bands. In november 2013 I saw them opening for Queens. Can you imagine how fucking cool it is that one of your favorite bands opens for another one of your favorite bands.

qotsa,2tb7hn,spartan0228,27,Thu Jan 22 19:02:09 2015 UTC,The album Humbug especially has a QOTSA feel to it.  This is probably cause it was produced by Josh Homme.

To anyone who is a fan of Royal blood I would recommend listening to the Canadian band 'Death From Above 1979' they have essentially the same set up as RB but imo pull it off better.  Love Band of Skulls tho :)  Edited for factual correctness"

Picked up their EP on a whim from Best Buy when it first came out; I can honestly say the wait between finishing that EP and the LP's release felt like fucking forever. Crazy good band.  Band of Skulls is really good too. They're a nice mix between AM and QotSA.
qotsa,2tb7hn,thewisefoolHHH,1 point,Sun Jan 25 07:19:24 2015 UTC,"Fuck yes Royal Blood! Killer album, favorite of last year. Also, the band Kyng could be up that alley too."
qotsa,2tb7hn,samwisethegray,11,Thu Jan 22 20:17:51 2015 UTC,"Well, if you only know QOTSA and TCV you could do a lot worse than buying all of the Desert Sessions and Kyuss albums.  I don't know of any bands not already mentioned by someone else that sound much like QOTSA, but Josh was the guitarist in Kyuss long before QOTSA ever existed and he was the only mainstay in Desert Sessions.  Kyuss are not really that much like QOTSA - they're much heavier and more psychadelic, but Desert Sessions have some very QOTSA-esque moments, even though on the whole they're more experimental."

qotsa,2tb7hn,Wizard-in--Black,1 point,Thu Jan 22 20:08:38 2015 UTC,"I'll also give a nod to The Wellwater Conspiracy. Most excellent. Much of that lineup also played under the name Hater, and released one record on A&M. It's not too shabby, but WWC is more cohesive. Josh sings lead vox on two WWC tracks from their album Brotherhood of the Electric: Ladder to the Moon, and Teenage Lambchop.  I don't like their entire catalog but there are a lot of Deftones tracks I play when listening to harder stuff like QOTSA. Their self-titled record is pretty solid. White Pony is probably their most popular."
qotsa,2tb7hn,syngltrkmnd,2,Thu Jan 22 22:37:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I love Wellwater Conspiracy, though, to be honest, I mainly listen to them because of Josh's inclusion on that album.  Teen Lambchop is awesome.  He also sings lead on Red Light, Green Light, which is another winner.  I should check out their other stuff, Brotherhood is the only album I have by them.  As for Deftones, what I've heard by them I'm not crazy about, by a friend of mine is a big fan and I keep hearing good things so I feel like I should check them out."

Do you know Blood Ceremony, The Oath or Clutch?  They're a bit more in the vein of the bands I mentioned a few posts ago (Sleep etc), but you might well like them given the groups you've mentioned."

Seen them live in December and they were honestly one of the best live acts I've ever seen; extremely tight yet still very raw. They've got three albums as of now. Last one was produced by Chriss Goss of Masters of Reality, who also produced Era Vulgaris, Lullabies to Paralyze and QOTSA's self-titled.      Best songs are (personally): Genious Inside The Bear, Supply and the Damned, We Are What We Hide, Marching Sideways (reminds me of God is in the Radio) and Cowboy Panda's Revenge, which has a Teenage Handmodel-like outro."

I could list a bunch of other songs, actually... I trully recomend you to listen to the whole album. Amazing stuff."

I like Jane's Addiction a lot, but I was introduced to them by seeing them live and in my opinion their studio sound doesn't quite live up to how good they sounded live.   Also if you haven't heard Eagles of Death Metal you should, they're awesome. Josh Homme on drums."

qotsa,2symqb,cdmccabe,8,Mon Jan 19 18:56:36 2015 UTC,"They did actually record a studio version of the track, they just didn't include it.  According to Josh it was almost a double album they had so much spare material.  It's a shame they didn't release all that stuff as an EP, because I'd kill to hear it, but realistically there's little chance of that happening now.  If they did another album it would most likely be new material.  I doubt they'd have any interest in releasing songs they wrote 6 or 7 years ago."

qotsa,2symqb,odaal,5,Mon Jan 19 19:21:48 2015 UTC,"I agree and disagree with this. I LOVE this song, and no studio recording can ever do it justice, but it would allow for more widespread distribution and high-quality audio (plus it would probably have more TCV material!!!)"

The guitar riff is just so menacing it makes me think of a zombie apocalypse. The whole song has the classic ""walking away from an explosion without looking back"" feel to it. And that solo is one of the best I've heard from Josh Homme. 10/10"
qotsa,2sty5f,Pqqtone,14,Sun Jan 18 16:40:52 2015 UTC,I love the in your face attitude and feel of this song. one of my personal favourites off like clockwork!
qotsa,2sty5f,Thamahawk76,11,Sun Jan 18 16:43:16 2015 UTC,"I wasn't a fan at first, mainly because it didn't sound much life the rest of the album.

Goddamn this song is amazing."
qotsa,2sty5f,skw5236,8,Sun Jan 18 18:15:41 2015 UTC,That guitar solo is my ringtone. So sexy.

qotsa,2sty5f,amouthforwar,6,Sun Jan 18 21:30:13 2015 UTC,"This is one of my favourite songs from the album now but for whatever reason it took a lot of listening to get there. It didn't initially grab me and I don't know why-- it's pure grimy QOTSA something I normally love instantly.  Doesn't matter though I love it now, and need to give an honourable mention to the music video cause it's really good."
qotsa,2sty5f,CeleryDistraction,6,Sun Jan 18 21:30:45 2015 UTC,"It's one of the only tracks on ...LC that feels more like old school QOTSA than the newer, sleeker sound they have now.  It definitely wouldn't sound out of place on Era Vulgaris.  Great riff, groovy as fuck and very badass.  Not my favorite on the album, but one of the best."

qotsa,2sty5f,7revor,6,Sun Jan 18 22:05:02 2015 UTC,"This song is the spiritual successor to Goin Out West, the Tom Waits song they covered a few years ago."

I played this song every single time the plane was taking off and landing. It felt right for some reason.   I love that song so much, and it made me really glad I got into QOTSA. To think I'd only seen them for the first time and first time hearing their music half a month before I left for my trip. Good music to travel around to.   Edit: and Holyshit does it sound good on vinyl."

qotsa,2sty5f,forevereverlife,3,Mon Jan 19 06:23:07 2015 UTC,"This was a quick favorite for me. For whatever reason, looking over the track listing when I first listened to ...LC, I saw ""Smooth Sailing"" and assumed it'd be another ballad, similar to Vampyre. Fuck almighty was I wrong. Instantly I was yammering about how incredible the song was, and then it hit that goddamn guitar solo and I shit. I shit right there in the bed. (Not literally).   My first QOTSA show was the ...LC tour, and being my favorite band, I was so excited. The set list was amazing and when I heard the start of Smooth Sailing, I wanted to cry. And when we got closer to the end I was just thinking ""Is he gonna do it? Is he gonna do that primal AYAYAYAYAAA yell? IS HE GONNA DO IT?!?!"" and he fucking belted it out better than on the album! Christ what a night.   But yeah anyone who dislikes Smooth Sailing, I don't understand. Its the closest they get to their roots on the album, while maintaining the new flow of things. It's the perfect middle ground for (as Josh put it) QOTSA part 1 and 2. (I think that's how he referred to Like Clockwork, qotsa part 2?) and to me would be THE song I'd show someone of they wanted to know what the band was all about."
qotsa,2sty5f,spastic-plastic,2,Sat Jan 24 07:44:25 2015 UTC,"Not only is it one of the greatest QOTSA tracks and my personal favourite from ...LC, Smooth Sailing is planet Earth's new all-time greatest stripper song."

qotsa,2s9b2a,Wizard-in--Black,5,Tue Jan 13 09:40:01 2015 UTC,I almost kinda see the first three songs on that record as being three parts of a song and Troy's opening guitar solo on Everyone Knows That You're Insane is an awesome transition from Medication.

The former was posted here pretty recently, and is easily some of their most powerful, driving music.  I love how sinister ""You're So Vague"" sounds, and that the lyrics and tone basically make it sound like Josh admires this girl for all the horrible things she does, which is an interesting concept.

qotsa,2s9b2a,dankyflam,3,Tue Jan 13 20:27:39 2015 UTC,"""You Got A Killer Scene There, Man"" is one of the most understated and sleekly cool of their songs so I can see why it's not really considered that much but I'd say it's definitely up there with their best songs; it's in my personal top 10. That throbbing bass with the guitar noodling over it is basically everything I love about Queens' sexy side. The lyrics are great too, ""What's the fucking difference we all gonna die. You gonna do something killer? Come on and give it a try."""

I'll start off by saying that F.F. was the one that grew on me for Clockwork and didn't seem particuarly well received based upon a few posts here...  so I can see why you went with that.   With this amount of b-sides and bootlegs, it's a bit daunting to choose one but using the formula of what I think is a killer fucking song divided by the number of times I have heard it played or discussed, I would have to go with ""Wake Up Screaming"".  There's too many choices for that not to change at some point but that's where I am at right now."

You're in luck that there was an EP called ""A Pair of Queens"" where EODM does its take on Go With the Flow, and I'm Gonna Leave You. So if you're trying to get into them it might help ease the transition.

qotsa,2s2a43,PoorGuyThatManJohnT,11,Sun Jan 11 15:01:17 2015 UTC,"Its weird, but aside from Little Sister, this song was my first introduction to the world of Homme.   And what an introduction indeed. It really set the tone for my follow through into the rest of TCV and then QOTSA and Kyuss.  What really hooked me was the musicality of the breakdown section of the song. Not a lot of songs can do it so well, so its always a nice touch when you find a song that doesn't just stick a guitar solo in there ""just because"""
qotsa,2s2a43,artlessvandal,8,Sun Jan 11 15:27:39 2015 UTC,This is my favorite song easily on the TCV album. And definitely in my top 3 for all of Homme's work. It never fails to make me shiver every time i listen to it.
qotsa,2s2a43,Mynameisfez,8,Sun Jan 11 16:46:28 2015 UTC,"I've always thought Bandoliers is one of Josh's most underrated songs.  Like many of the best TCV tracks, it's quite long and it's more riff centric than some of the QOTSA stuff done around that time.  Those opening chords are so strong and the ""Prepare and take aim"" bit is just awesome.  Definitely one of my favorites from a very strong album."
qotsa,2s2a43,Wizard-in--Black,8,Sun Jan 11 16:46:34 2015 UTC,"This song is totally Led Zeppelin, especially starting at 3:34. Not just me, right?"
qotsa,2s2a43,coldvault,6,Sun Jan 11 21:24:46 2015 UTC,I feel like most of TCV sounds more like Zeppelin than any Grohl or Homme project. Shows how much of an influence Jon Paul Jones had in Zeppelin and TCV.
qotsa,2s2a43,rht_rv,5,Mon Jan 12 12:18:52 2015 UTC,"I've loved this song all the more when I listened to it on a set of broken speakers which only plays the left side audio. Getting mostly just JPJs bass and then the guitar coming in at points works unbelievably well. I'd recommend at least once listening to it with just the left audio, it's quality.  Great song either way though, definitely at least a 9/10, gotta love that noodly bass."
qotsa,2s2a43,LivinDavideLoca,4,Sun Jan 11 19:58:38 2015 UTC,"Definitely one of the top songs on TCV. In a nutshell I think Josh is weaving a story of unrequited love, which is one of the oldest human stories. I think in particular the whole album uses classical themes as a touchstone. Whether it's dealing with the devil (Interlude), or forbidden love/lust (both Nobody Loves Me and Reptiles), altered states of mind (Mind Eraser), or the tragedy of losing your identity (Elephants and Gunman), this whole album is ripe with amazing writing and creative control. The level these musicians are on is near four-of-a-kind (I always include Alain).  Also, the theme of animals is there to remind us that we as humans are animals too. Easily susceptible to basic instinct and regard only for survival. I think Josh and company put a lot of heart and mind into this album and it shows.   And lastly the composition of Bandoliers is mind blowing. It has its own movements for cripes sake. And none of it is complete without Dave. Ohhhh Dave...  edit: spelling"
qotsa,2s2a43,leftaab,5,Mon Jan 12 04:20:17 2015 UTC,I think the lyrics are awesome. The riff right before the chorus is so simple but so much fun to play. And the fucking drums during the breakdown.
qotsa,2s2a43,Taydolf_Switler22,4,Sun Jan 11 17:32:42 2015 UTC,i like this song
qotsa,2s2a43,schwoogiejoe24,4,Sun Jan 11 18:28:33 2015 UTC,"Despite not listening to the TCV album in quite a few months (time for a listen!) I saw the title of the song in this post and immediately fell into the groove of it in my head. I love the feel of this song, so twisty and weird. I agree that this song perfectly encapsulates TCV, something about it just draws me in and hypnotizes me. This kind of dark weirdness is one of the things I love most about Josh's music."
qotsa,2s2a43,honeynoats,3,Sun Jan 11 19:04:21 2015 UTC,"This is hands down, my most favorite song of all time. I love the drums, the bass, and riff, and Josh's Vocals. I love how it starts slow and builds in momentum to the explosive ending. Its so well done. This song in particular is also the first song I have cover on drums. I learned so many techniques based on what Grohl put into this. Every time I'm behind my kit, its the first thing I start jamming to.   If you like this song, I highly suggest listening to Hwy 1. Its so similar to the riff and the breakdown. Its another TCV classic."
qotsa,2s2a43,xbxvx97,3,Sun Jan 11 21:11:03 2015 UTC,Some awesome drum rolls on this track!
qotsa,2s2a43,Tidder3D,2,Mon Jan 12 02:01:35 2015 UTC,"Bandoliers was the song that convinced me to pick up the TVC album. Not that I needed much convincing but still one listen to this jam and I was hooked.  It's still a top song on the album IMO and from Homme's overall resume I think it's one of his finest moment on the mic. Not only that but everyone in the band goes in on this song. The way the guitar riffs and baseline melds together is almost too smooth, it's one of those songs you never want to end."
qotsa,2s2a43,CeleryDistraction,2,Sun Jan 11 21:41:59 2015 UTC,"My intro to so much. I found out about TCV through JPJ's Thunderthief and this came on shuffle first. I loved it from the start. This and New Fang got me into TCV and that made me stop and think. Through that, I rediscovered my love for Led Zeppelin, and discovered QOTSA and the Foos. Through them, I got into Nirvana, Mini Mansions, (and through some more convoluted story arcs) Gorillaz, Jimi Hendrix, and Pink Floyd. And I owe all of it to this masterpiece. Great song. Sick riff, love the resigned vocals leading up to the ""this is goodbye"" and string section. That chord progression before the whispered ""fire away"" is one of my all-time favourite music bits. TL;DR--I owe a huge portion of my life to this song. Good stuff."
qotsa,2s2a43,notactuallyjoshhomme,2,Mon Jan 12 17:39:26 2015 UTC,"This is probably my favorite song on the album. On top of a kick ass riff, Josh's low growling voice is just so great and suits the song so well.  Then the few parts where it goes into the high range of his vocals I feel at that very point in the whole album it gets ramped up from a fantastic album into the realm of an extraordinarily outstanding album because of those moments and this song alone."
qotsa,2s2a43,Shadow_Struck,2,Mon Jan 12 21:03:21 2015 UTC,God dammit I missed the Bandoliers discussion!  It currently resides at #2 in my favorite songs of all time rankings.  I never get tired of it.  Grohl is a monster on this track.  Also JPJ but the bass is super down in the mix.
qotsa,2s2a43,2tidesaday,2,Thu Jan 15 15:56:10 2015 UTC,"The song is perfection. I'd like to mention that I absolutely love how the drums work their way into the song. In the break-down part in the middle Dave introduces a distinct repeating drum fill, then the whole band finds a way to work in that same fill during the final chorus. I just love how they incorporate it in and make it work so damn well."

The CD was accompanied by a handwritten letter asking fans to share the song in any way possible  From the looks of it, it doesn't seem like QOTSA released the track on vinyl at all. The song was meant to be free anyways and people only got CDs with the track in it. Sorry man, maybe you can find a bootleg.

The problem I have now with QOTSA is that if you've seen one of their LC era shows, you've practically seen them all.  Obviously there are exceptions, but on the whole they play all the songs almost exactly note for note from the albums.  The only track they really ever improvise on is Feel Good."

qotsa,2rener,Wizard-in--Black,2,Mon Jan 5 18:36:22 2015 UTC,"Better Living was incredible.  Missing is a great live jam too, but saying they play them regularly is a bit of a stretch.  I wish they did, but extended jams are pretty infrequent now.  They haven't played Missing live since Oct '14.  This is what the 2014 set looked like on averaged, and while it's a great selection of songs, there's not many surprises, and fewer tracks where they go off on incredible jams.  They're still an absolute force to reckoned with live, but it's just as shame they don't do more jams like Better Living because when they do it's incredible.  Plus I'd like to see a few unusual choices in there - Misfit Love, Avon, Tangled Up in Plaid, hell, they could really adventurous and play Teenage Hand Model.  I think the only time they ever played that song was on a couple of the 2011 s/t dates."

They played Teenage Hand Model at every single show of the s/t re-release tour. They played the entire album every night. They had only played it a handful of times prior to 2011.      I agree that they should've played a wider range of songs on the LC tour. Although they did play Misfit Love a good few times."
qotsa,2rener,Wizard-in--Black,1 point,Mon Jan 5 19:05:08 2015 UTC,"Shit, did they really play The Forum in Oct?  Feels more like it only happened a few weeks ago haha.    They played Missing a lot early on in the LC tour (the 2013 leg), but you've got to bare in mind that it was a long tour (around a year and a half) with a lot of dates, and they played it pretty infrequently in the more recently 2014 leg - only 22 times out of 86 in fact, which definitely isn't a lot.  Counting the whole tour, they still only played it 76 out of 178 nights.  I wouldn't call that particularly regular - certainly not when they played My God is the Sun (a vastly inferior song imo) 174 times.    I didn't realize they played the whole album every single night of the s/t tour, I thought they just played the majority of it + select other tracks.  I'd still like to see Handmodel aired a bit more regularly though.  They actually only played Misfit Love 26 times though."
qotsa,2rener,BinaryChode,1 point,Mon Jan 5 20:19:27 2015 UTC,"You are 100% correct, they don't change things up at all now, also the sound is so polished just listening to that grimy distorted guitar sound on some of those 99-2000 shows is mind blowing."
qotsa,2rener,Wizard-in--Black,3,Mon Jan 5 21:36:11 2015 UTC,"That's my sentiment exactly.  They're a bit... sleek now, live.  That might have something to do with the more introspective sound of LC but apart from a few standout jams done on the '13/'14 world tour, I don't think they can match the power of their early lineups, live anyway.  That's probably going to be a controversial opinion here, because most people on reddit seem to favor this current lineup over any QOTSA have had before, but to be honest, I just don't think they're as ballsy as they used to be."
qotsa,2rener,BinaryChode,1 point,Mon Jan 5 23:29:20 2015 UTC,"They def are not. I don't mind the lineup now but it's gearing more towards foo fighters territory. I guess that happens when you get older and have a family you mellow out, lose your edge a bit."
qotsa,2rener,Wizard-in--Black,1 point,Mon Jan 5 23:45:55 2015 UTC,"I know what you mean.  Don't get me wrong though, I still think they're a great live act (still far better than Foo Fighters haha) and LC is fucking great album (though it's my least favorite QOTSA album) but they're not what they used to be.  To be honest though, that's probably no coincidence.  I imagine that Josh's near death experience probably put him in a completely different space to the one he had been in before which is maybe why LC is such a change of pace.  For the same reason I really can't see TCV 2 happening as much as I wish it would.  LC is such a different album to TCV that I just can't see him putting himself in that headspace again.  Hope I'm wrong though."
qotsa,2rener,BinaryChode,0,Mon Jan 5 23:53:19 2015 UTC,"I Think the next album will decide my future love of this band. I can't wait to hear what Jon Theodore might bring to the sound.

qotsa,2rener,Wizard-in--Black,1 point,Tue Jan 6 01:05:38 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I would still be a big fan even if the album was still in the vein of LC, because it's a great album imo.  But I would definitely prefer it if they started rocking out more.  My personal dream QOTSA album would be one that grooves like the s/t, with oliveri back on vocals (a man can dream...) and the experimental aspects of Era Vulgaris.  But that's not gonna happen.  I'm interested to see what Jon brings to the table too, because really he hasn't had a change to show what he's capable of yet."

It's not quite top 10 material, but it's one of their best songs.  Josh once said the drum beat reminded him of Sly and the Family Stone and while it isn't a funk song by any means, it can see where he's coming from.  It grooves.  It perfectly balances memorability with subtlety and the riff in some ways is one of Josh's most interesting.  The vocal line is brilliant and it shares a lot in terms of it's feel with the equally brilliant I Never Came.   One of their best."

My god those are the most beautiful sounds my ears have witnessed. DAT SLIDE GUITAR. Josh going to his high falsetto. And it's not too complicated composition too.

You know the albums good when one of the ""middle of pack"" songs is good enough for me to become obsessed with for like an entire month.  Like others have mentioned this song could probably have fit in nicely on LtP. But IMO it's the most perfect gap song between I'm designer and misfit love possible.

Now before I go back and buy it I'll know to check the sticker. I'd hate to drop 50 bucks on something that isn't the real deal.  I'm pretty sure they've had that copy for quite a while (I'm just recently in the market for it so I feel as if I've seen it without giving it a thought), not sure if it's over 6/7 months old though."

That's why I thought for sure it was the real deal before I read this about the sticker (I still have to investigate that, probably drive over tomorrow).

qotsa,2qyys0,TobyTheFox,2,Wed Jan 14 05:28:01 2015 UTC,Want to clarify a couple things here as far as the Rated R reissues go:  Original- Sticker on front cover & text on back: (dont make me beg...) 1st Reissue- Printed on front cover & no text on back (this reissue was pressed from poor source audio and should be avoided generally) 2nd Reissue- Printed on front cover & text on back
qotsa,2qyys0,TobyTheFox,1 point,Sun Jan 4 04:10:17 2015 UTC,"Like I said in the OP, the ""2nd reissue"" is a bootleg, so it's worth mentioning that in case some misunderstands and thinks it's genuine, which it isn't."

I'm sure you know can identify Josh's voice: smooth sounding, groovy, often going into a high range or falsetto  Mark's voice: very distinctive, he has a very deep voice with a very noticeable rasp.  He can hit some serious low notes.    Nick's voice: If there's screaming on anything on Rated R or Songs for the Deaf, it's pretty much guaranteed to be Nick.  However, he doesn't just scream.  He also sings melodically, like on ""Auto Pilot"" or ""Gonna Leave You"".  His voice is kind of light and a bit raspy.  It doesn't have Josh's smoothness or Mark's depth.  So Josh is the standard singer, Mark is used when you want a growly, deep vocie, and Nick SCREAMS!"

qotsa,2qu86y,scottlapier,2,Wed Dec 31 05:05:01 2014 UTC,More often than not its Josh.  Anything that sounds like growling is probably Mark Lanegan(sp?).  I hope that helps a little but I'm sure other people on here will be more specific.
qotsa,2qu86y,scottlapier,1 point,Tue Dec 30 19:25:16 2014 UTC,I've been a fan of Lanegan's since Screaming Trees days. I should be able to pick him out.   When does Nick sing?

And also a couple of solo lines and backing (I think?) of Kalopsia.   You may be able to decipher Alex Turner's backing vocals a smidge on ""If I Had A Tail"".  And, I believe Elton John's backing vocals are heard on ""Fairweather Friends""? I know he played piano but I think I can hear him too."

qotsa,2qn5tv,Gonzzzo,1 point,Mon Dec 29 01:57:49 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I've known this one for a while. It was actually record in 1997, before the first album, though.  The band demoed a few tracks (sources vary as to how many tracks were recorded - three have been leaked but it's likely there is a fourth one) in late 97 / very early 98, whereas the album was recorded in April 98.  The demo sessions became known as the Plastic Turks sessions, as the band was allegedly called that at the time (I'm not 100% sure if that's correct, but it seems likely given that they were called Gamma Ray in 95/96)  Pre-debut album QOTSA lineups changed every other week practically, so it was just coincidental that Josh fired the rest of the band shortly before recording the album."
qotsa,2qn5tv,Wizard-in--Black,1 point,Mon Dec 29 00:43:56 2014 UTC,"also Josh originally didn't want to sing, just wanted to play guitar but every singer he auditioned sucked so he just did it himself."

qotsa,2qn5tv,BinaryChode,1 point,Mon Dec 29 19:10:53 2014 UTC,Do you know who?  I've always heard he wanted Lanegan to sing lead on the whole album.
qotsa,2qn5tv,Wizard-in--Black,1 point,Mon Dec 29 23:18:45 2014 UTC,"I do not, would love to know. Either read/heard an interview that was done a few years ago when they had the tour for the first album. In a lot of the interviews he was going back over the first album and the start of the band and he said he never wanted to sing. Auditioned a bunch of singers, hated them all so he just had to do it. Also said that's why he had mark and Nick sing on rated R and SFTD because he was never really comfortable being the lead singer. Up until L2P of course and now he is fine with it."
qotsa,2qn5tv,BinaryChode,1 point,Mon Dec 29 23:55:08 2014 UTC,"Very interesting.  That reminded me, that they did have a different lead vocalist known as 'The Kid' (apparently) in one early lineup, who sung on this track.  It would be really interesting to know who else was auditioned in the band though."
qotsa,2qn5tv,Wizard-in--Black,1 point,Tue Dec 30 00:28:34 2014 UTC,"In this thread, it was claimed that The Kid was a guy called Scott Anderson. I've also heard before that Jason Albertini was involved back in those pre-Stone Age days.       Pete Stahl (Scream, earthlings?, Desert Sessions) would've been around the band in the early days. He sang at some live shows between 1998 and 2000. For example, the last song of this show: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuiDkm1I3SE and a couple at this show: http://www.setlist.fm/setlist/queens-of-the-stone-age/1998/starfish-room-vancouver-bc-canada-13d72179.html"

I think I've heard the name Scott Anderson before somewhere, and I've heard a few people say they think Jason Albertini was the kid, too.  It's a shame someone doesn't interview Josh and just ask him a load nerdy, indepth questions about all this stuff so he can clear all this confusion up.  I doubt he'd go a long with it, though."

qotsa,2qn5tv,BinaryChode,1 point,Tue Dec 30 01:08:16 2014 UTC,"I'm not sure he actually ""auditioned"" anyone. All he has ever said about the topic was that he wasn't entirely comfortable being the front man at that stage, and that he wanted Lanegan to sing on the album (in addition to him, not instead, as far as I understand). When Lanegan said he was unavailable (presumably because he was recording Scraps at Midnight), Josh decided to just sing it all himself."

qotsa,2qn5tv,BinaryChode,1 point,Tue Dec 30 02:57:49 2014 UTC,"That's pretty much my understanding of it.  I haven't heard the interview where he talks about auditioning different people, but I have heard him a say a few times about Lanegan specifically.  It's frustrating when interviewees change their own stories, because you never know when he's fabricating something to make the story sound a little better."
qotsa,2qn5tv,Wizard-in--Black,1 point,Tue Dec 30 10:56:20 2014 UTC,"Huh... I wonder why it's titled that. It definitely does sound more like a Kyuss song, but I don't know if Kyuss used to do instrumental songs. It kind of reminded me of a heavier counterpart to Spiders and Vingaroons. Maybe it was just a matter of how both are instrumental, or similar instruments used in recording. Like they both have that super distorted, mechanical sounding guitar(?) in the background.  I'll have to give Oppenheimer's Brother another listen."

Funny, all these years listening to Queens (almost 15 years!) and I'm still hearing about stuff I've never listened to before.   The track is very Kyuss-sounding; all instrumental, more riff-heavy than a well-constructed Queens song, but I guess Josh is experimenting with heavy jams here. Pretty interesting."
qotsa,2qmg7n,PoorGuyThatManJohnT,7,Sun Dec 28 16:01:35 2014 UTC,"Medication is awesome.  It fast, gutsy and fun.  It pretty much encapsulates what QOTSA are about in two mins. It's their best song obviously, but it packs a punch and it's a great opener.  The song was demoed by Josh and Nick's short lived 2003 supergroup Headband.  It started out a lot slower and less energetic, but it's an interesting version.  This Lullaby is an interesting one, as the name would suggest it's almost a nursery rhyme, but a really ominous one.  It's a classy into, but it's more like a prologue than the 1st song of the album proper if you get what I mean."
qotsa,2qmg7n,Wizard-in--Black,5,Sun Dec 28 16:15:31 2014 UTC,"Medication isn't my favorite song by them but it'll always be special to me because it's my first Queens song.

qotsa,2qmg7n,LivinDavideLoca,2,Tue Dec 30 17:17:59 2014 UTC,These songs do a fantastic job setting the tone for the rest of the album.

qotsa,2qmg7n,CeleryDistraction,2,Mon Dec 29 01:29:50 2014 UTC,"Im an oddball and Lullabies is my favorite album as a whole by far although other albums have songs that i enjoy a lot more individually. This lullaby is a nice song, i love Lanegans stuff and this is no exception. The version of josh singing in the beginning of one of the dvds is also fantastic.  Medication I used to not dig so much but i started letting the album play instead of skipping to everybody knows youre insane and it grew on me. Just a good rock song, and the melody between verses is fun to sing along to."

It's such a perfect end to a great album, IMO - really puts that sense of finality on it.  Other than that, the riff on How To Handle A Rope is badass."

qotsa,2qgjkk,MROlson,1 point,Sat Dec 27 17:36:54 2014 UTC,"The live version of ""You Can't Quit Me Baby"" from Over the Years and Through the Woods DVD/CD. One of the best live performances ever, by any band. That rendition completely embodies QOTSA as a band - atmospheric, intense, groovy, cerebral. The energy. The whole song is a trip and for my money, the guitar work can't be beat. Almost Cream-ish with the dueling leads/solos that tie together seamlessly. Yeah, super passionate about that song."
qotsa,2qgwzo,elephant_parmesean,4,Fri Dec 26 20:00:09 2014 UTC,The thing I don't get about a lot of remixes generally (official or otherwise) is that they don't sound anything like the original.  This is maybe 30% BLTC and the rest is completely nothing to do with QOTSA at all.

The answer to that is clear. To continue to crucify a man for issues he's gone through excruciating lengths to correct is petty.

qotsa,2q34ki,SixshooteR32,1 point,Tue Dec 23 15:14:48 2014 UTC,I believe he started with the bass! I guessing it cause he is more known as a bass player in the community

qotsa,2pz0v3,PoorGuyThatManJohnT,16,Sun Dec 21 13:57:42 2014 UTC,"the solo really doesn't fit with the rest of the song   Seriously?  I'm not being funny, but I'd like to see anyone here do better.   Josh is a badass guitarist and a great soloist, and that solo rocks, it's one of the best elements of the song.  The riff is classic and it has a strong polka influence, which is interesting because Josh said he used to get guitar lessons from a polka guitarist back when he was a kid.    Anyway, the song is great, and it's the single best intro song to the band there is, but it's far from their best song overall, as is often the case with many of their singles."
qotsa,2pz0v3,Wizard-in--Black,5,Sun Dec 21 16:35:47 2014 UTC,Agreed. If someone else can think of a better solo that fits this song I'm all ears. Josh has a very melodic soloing style which often means easy playing but he's still pulls of some how the fuck? riffs.
qotsa,2pz0v3,Taydolf_Switler22,2,Sun Dec 21 21:44:12 2014 UTC,"fucking riffs, how do they work?"
qotsa,2pz0v3,real_nice_guy,13,Mon Dec 22 00:11:11 2014 UTC,"Fuck, I just saw the title. I really have to stop making these on my phone."
qotsa,2pz0v3,CeleryDistraction,6,Sun Dec 21 15:25:36 2014 UTC,"Great song. The riff is basically a classic at this point; even my mom knows it. It's the one QOTSA song I hear everywhere: the mall, hockey games, the radio and even the fucking farmers market. The band plays it at every show they do, basically it's almost bigger than the band in a way because even people who don't know the band know the song.  All that being said it's no where near my favourite QOTSA song. It's good but I don't find myself going to listen to it very often unless I'm listening to the entire SFTD album. IMO the is still at it's best following millionaire-- that transition is perfect.  I honestly don't know if I'd like this song better if it wasn't as popular. It's hard to really enjoy it when you hear it every other day... The special feeling gets lost and it just doesn't have the same shine. But the drums do fucking kick ass, the riff is heavy and a modern classic, and the lyrics are great. It really has all the elements of a good song. I think maybe the biggest compliment I can give is that I am still pumped when they play no one knows live.   Tldr; overplay dulls the song a bit, but it's still fucking awesome."
qotsa,2pz0v3,Jessiccino,5,Sun Dec 21 21:50:47 2014 UTC,"For whatever reason, back when this first came out, I wasn't yet into QOTSA and I found it really annoying for some reason... maybe because it was so damn catchy? I can't get enough of it now, though. I find it impossible to not bob my head when it comes on."
qotsa,2pz0v3,Gamerhcp,4,Sun Dec 21 14:20:49 2014 UTC,"i love the lyrics, first song that got me into qotsa, the thumbnail of the video kinda creeped me out sometimes lol"
qotsa,2pz0v3,tha_snazzle,4,Sun Dec 21 15:00:01 2014 UTC,"This was the first QOTSA song I was aware of, since it was a hit. I remember the first thing that struck me was the Beatles-esque backing vocals. I remember thinking ""this might be what the Beatles would sound like if they came out today."" I was sold from that moment.  This song, and Queens in general, taught me that sex and danger is way more rock n' roll than aggression. Think about mainstream modern hard rock of the past 15 years: all aggression and macho attitude. No groove. No real element of danger or sex. Queens flipped the script on that, and there's no other modern rock band that does it nearly as well.*  *Arctic Monkeys' AM notwithstanding, but Josh had a hand in some of that as well."
qotsa,2pz0v3,Taydolf_Switler22,5,Sun Dec 21 19:00:36 2014 UTC,Or dangerous sex.
qotsa,2pz0v3,Dodahevolution,2,Sun Dec 21 21:45:32 2014 UTC,"Agree with aggression, and it Aldo is apparent in older works by Josh, such as gardenia, which is pure aggression and groove"
qotsa,2pz0v3,Taydolf_Switler22,5,Sun Dec 21 19:49:47 2014 UTC,Anyone who doesn't think this song is songwriting perfection needs to get over themselves.
qotsa,2pz0v3,JohnnyDrama240,3,Sun Dec 21 21:46:19 2014 UTC,The first time I heard QOTSA was this song from a movie trailer (Confidence). I had no idea what or who the song was so I searched relentlessly for a good while but still couldn't find it. Fast forward about 5-6 years and I finally find Songs for the Deaf and my favorite band was born
qotsa,2pz0v3,headless_bourgeoisie,3,Sun Dec 21 15:32:21 2014 UTC,"It's a fine song, but if I would be completely okay with never hearing it again."
qotsa,2pz0v3,mcmahon212,6,Sun Dec 21 20:30:36 2014 UTC,"This song is great for newcomers to the band... And that's about it. I never listen to it anymore. Last time i did was about a year ago. This is really one of the weakest songs on SFTD. I think it was written to be a single. Much like Radiohead's ""Creep"", it's a good starting point, but there are so many better songs in their discography."
qotsa,2pz0v3,CeleryDistraction,9,Sun Dec 21 16:07:47 2014 UTC,"I actually think it's the perfect follow up to millionaire. Like you said if was probably written as a single, but I think it still fits in the greater context of SftD. Like you I don't listen to it much but that's mostly just because I hear it everywhere anyway. Still think it rips live though!"
qotsa,2pz0v3,mcmahon212,6,Sun Dec 21 22:32:50 2014 UTC,No argument there. They jammed like no tomorrow to this tune when i saw them in may. I definitely enjoyed that. But the studio version doesn't do much for me anymore. I wont fault anyone for saying it's their favorite queens song. It's just not my thing anymore.
qotsa,2pz0v3,notactuallyjoshhomme,2,Mon Dec 22 00:13:44 2014 UTC,"I love the way this transitions from Millionaire, on the album and in concert. When I saw them in Brooklyn last year, they opened the concert with these back to back. This song kicks ass"

qotsa,2pz0v3,caterault,2,Sun Dec 21 21:24:58 2014 UTC,"As with a lot of you guys, this was the first Queens song I actually heard, and ironically enough I neither knew the name nor that Queens were behind it for years (It's going so far back I can't even recall where or when exactly I heard it). I only even knew the starting riff from memory, but after I blindly lept into LC after hearing the glowing reviews (and enjoying it more then expected), No One Knows served as the starting point for entering the rest of the band's discography. I remember finding the chorus and bridges to sound strangely out of place at first, like that had a more demonic feel to them then the punky main riff gave off (little did I know). One night I decided to blow through the entirety of SFTD, and needless to say, I was hooked after hearing Millionaire and First It Giveth. It was such a pleasant surprise to find out the band had created this kind of harsh sound, having come from the relatively tamer LC, and that's how I eventually got round the entire discography.  Back to No One Knows, I do believe it to be a very strong track and an excellent one to get into Queens with, however, I do agree with those saying the main riff sounds a little out of place in the overall scheme of SFTD, however the rest of the song more than compliments the musical sound of that respective album."

qotsa,2pros3,Sephtical,1 point,Fri Dec 19 07:54:52 2014 UTC,"Yeah, supposedly she sent him a FB friend request, and he responded with his phone number.   Edit: Also, this is not a real album cover. If you read her post, it's something she created and supposedly showed to Jesse when he supposedly contacted her. The image (without the EODM text) was uploaded to her FB account in June."

qotsa,2pp3ha,Wizard-in--Black,1 point,Thu Dec 18 19:40:45 2014 UTC,I feel like this is just a tough song to cover.  There's some kind of ironic/ subversive undertone that Josh puts into it that's lost when covered by anyone else.
qotsa,2pp3ha,Paddyish,1 point,Thu Dec 18 19:25:49 2014 UTC,If this had been their song from the start it would have been decent enough.  I quite like all the wailing guitars and I think it grooves along nicely enough but it's nothing compared with the original.  I guess I might be a bit biased though.
qotsa,2pp3ha,adrian1897,1 point,Thu Dec 18 19:51:10 2014 UTC,Yeah. As much as I love Placebo nothing will ever beat the original.
qotsa,2pp3ha,Falstaffsword,1 point,Thu Dec 18 20:00:43 2014 UTC,I like Placebo but they totally butchered the song. In my mind it's supposed to be energetic not slow and meandering.

qotsa,2pj90q,minimumnishe,3,Wed Dec 17 14:35:05 2014 UTC,"I think you've got it the wrong way round. The MOV pressing is the cheaper one, goes for about £20 here so average vinyl price. The orange and purple original pressing is the one with the 3 extra tracks on it. The MOV one has only Like A Drug while the original has Precious And Grace and Infinity on it as well."
qotsa,2pj90q,minimumnishe,0,Wed Dec 17 16:19:28 2014 UTC,"Yeah I see what you're saying I'm stupid. Its the AntAcid pressing that's the colored vinyl. I'd get the MoV pressing if it wasn't only three sides, it feels like a waste of vinyl (that's why I'm waiting out on getting Year Zero on vinyl too)"

qotsa,2pj90q,Wizard-in--Black,1 point,Wed Dec 17 17:01:34 2014 UTC,On the Orange/purple original it's the same studio version that's available on the CD.  I can't comment on the MOV version but in all likelihood it's the same version as the O/P version as it mimics the CD track listing.  Are you looking for a live version or the studio version?
qotsa,2pj90q,benduder,1 point,Wed Dec 17 15:04:39 2014 UTC,"I'm looking for the studio version because I love it. Looks like I'm saving for the orange/purple one then, I'd love infinity as well. Thanks for your help!"

qotsa,2p9gwi,CeleryDistraction,2,Mon Dec 15 02:19:50 2014 UTC,"Feel Good Hit of the Summer:       ""Feel Good Hit of the Summer"" is a song by American rock band Queens of the Stone Age and written by band members Josh Homme and Nick Oliveri. It is the opening track of their second album, Rated R, and the second single to be released from it.  The song also accompanied the UK release of the album on a separate CD entitled Rated U.  Upon the album's release, ""Feel Good Hit of the Summer"" had particular attention drawn to it due to the song's focus on drugs. Despite this, critical reception to the song was generally positive.

qotsa,2p9gwi,Karrottz,4,Mon Dec 15 02:13:15 2014 UTC,From a live performance perspective this song makes for an incredible set opener.  All the anticipation for them to come on stage followed by the build up to the crescendo of this song really sets the tone for what's to come.
qotsa,2p9gwi,zoso27,5,Sun Dec 14 23:27:11 2014 UTC,I don't have much to say about this song other than it immediately puts a massive shit eating grin across my face. And I don't think their could be a more perfect song to open Rated-R.
qotsa,2p9kp1,minimumnishe,8,Sun Dec 14 15:36:55 2014 UTC,Think the closest we'll see to them playing together was the Grammys cluster fuck from last year
qotsa,2p9kp1,vincientjames,12,Sun Dec 14 15:52:36 2014 UTC,Man that really sucks. Its a shame that they went on tour together and then didn't interact with each other's sets

It's pressed as a triple 10"" with an oversized sleeve, so it can be a little annoying to play as each side last under 10 mins, but it's a curio, that's for sure.  If when you say deluxe, you're referring to a vinyl pressing of the 2cd tour edition with a blue cover, then no, only the standard album has been pressed on vinyl.  UK purchase link  Us purchase link"
qotsa,2ounnv,Wizard-in--Black,2,Wed Dec 10 09:54:13 2014 UTC,"I have to add a little warning/side note here. I'm a vinyl collector and I'm not sure how casual or non-casual OP's friend takes audio quality. I own the triple 10"" and I have to say that even though none of Queens' albums have been mastered very well or anything, it is one of the worst sounding records in my collection. That being said, it is a pretty cool physical specimen. xD"
qotsa,2ounnv,Funkbass,3,Wed Dec 10 18:08:18 2014 UTC,"...Like Clockwork sounds pretty good, I think.  But yeah, I've heard a lot of people say Era Vulgaris (and most of their other albums) sounds like shit.  I'm a massive vinyl collector but I wouldn't class myself as too much of an audiophile, so I don't think it sounds too bad.  The production on the album has a pretty grimey feel in the first place, too."

qotsa,2ot6b6,crocodome,1 point,Wed Dec 10 04:39:04 2014 UTC,Well considering my piano is way out of tune and about 10 of the keys don't work I don't think it would have sounded very good.  Also I played the piano intro on guitar to surmount the same problem.  I do love when JPJ plays though (I am not worthy).
qotsa,2ot5z1,TheBronzeMex,3,Wed Dec 10 00:02:29 2014 UTC,Was about to post a link to an article about this...  I think this pretty much confirms the new album will come out sometime late 2015/early 2016. I'm so pumped!
qotsa,2ot5z1,Kaijusaurus,2,Wed Dec 10 00:05:58 2014 UTC,I'd put my bills on single coming out around that time. Shows at the very end of September so I'd say thats when we get the new single or maybe sometime in October. The new album I'd probably guess somewhere around January.
qotsa,2ot5z1,Taydolf_Switler22,1 point,Wed Dec 10 02:10:36 2014 UTC,It could but I doubt it. My guess is they will be recording this summer but still play a few big money festivals.
qotsa,2ot5z1,Sephtical,-5,Wed Dec 10 18:51:03 2014 UTC,"Pretty strange, I hope this means new album and there not just doing it for the pay check"
qotsa,2ot5z1,BinaryChode,6,Wed Dec 10 05:36:39 2014 UTC,There's nothing wrong with doing it for the money. Paychecks from festival shows like that can bankroll all sorts of good things that benefit even you
qotsa,2ot5z1,jessamineny,-1,Wed Dec 10 15:40:22 2014 UTC,"Sure there's lots wrong with doing things just for the money, but that's my opinion clearly you disagree."
qotsa,2ot5z1,BinaryChode,3,Wed Dec 10 18:01:47 2014 UTC,So a band has to be touring directly off a new album or they shouldn't be playing shows?
qotsa,2ot5z1,Sephtical,-4,Wed Dec 10 22:50:44 2014 UTC,"Nope but how about play your own queens of the stone age show. Ya know full length mix up the set list. Playing a festival they mow through the ""hits"" and play for like an hour. Everyone knows these festivals are a cash grab that's not an industry secret."
qotsa,2ot5z1,BinaryChode,1 point,Thu Dec 11 01:05:53 2014 UTC,"Sets tend to be shorter at festivals, the but the set lists are pretty much the same as their normal live shows.  First I've heard about festivals being cash grabs, sounds like you're just being cynical.  They play live shows, that's what bands do.  If RIR asked them to play a show, why would they turn it down?"
qotsa,2ot5z1,Wizard-in--Black,0,Thu Dec 11 18:38:33 2014 UTC,"Absolutely untrue you can check the set lists online, for the short festival sets are almost exactly the same they mix in one or two different songs. They play little sister, no one knows, make it with shit, dead, millionaire, and a few others. Queens show is much longer. As for festivals being cash grabs now you know, you've just been told."

qotsa,2oryzs,Namrhof,5,Tue Dec 9 18:16:50 2014 UTC,Live From the Basement is absolutely incredible. Amazing sound quality. I recommend the Radiohead / Thom Yorke / Sonic Youth sessions if you're interested in any of them. Shame most of the QOTSA ones aren't on YouTube anymore.

A lot of it sounds like B-sides from Arctic Monkeys' Humbug/Suck It And See era, most of which are great.  Standouts for me were 'The Last Man Standing At The Nine Till Noon Inn', 'The Hollers And The Hymns', and 'Temptation Pool'. Loved 'Hold On' as well, reminded me a bit of Elvis Perkins In Dearland mixed with Dan Auerbach's solo album, both of which are amongst my favourite albums.  Great recommendation!"

qotsa,2ojwkm,PoorGuyThatManJohnT,7,Sun Dec 7 14:55:56 2014 UTC,"As a matter of interest, why combine the two songs?  There's no version of the album that I know of where they're listed as a medley and they aren't even adjacent on the track list.    Hispanic Impressions is for me the embodiment of that experimental side Josh had in the 90's / early 2000's and it's very much in the vein of the psychedelic instrumentals he did on the early QOTSA split EPs and the Desert Sessions.    Give the Mule what he wants is just badass.  It's got a driving groove and it's one of the best examples of 'robot rock' on the album.  Great riff, groovy bass and a driving drum beat.  What more can you ask for?"
qotsa,2ojwkm,Wizard-in--Black,8,Sun Dec 7 16:17:44 2014 UTC,"Give the mule what he wants is one of my favourite songs off the first album, that or you can't quit me baby, but I think its a great song, I just love the opening swinging bass riff and how it just turns into a pumped song. Be the mule that you gotta be"
qotsa,2ojwkm,tvoozler,8,Tue Dec 9 19:53:35 2014 UTC,"When I saw Qotsa live a couple years ago, Josh went on a pretty long tangent before the band played Hispanic Impressions. Josh told a story of when he was really high when writing it and was simply screwing around on his guitar and trying to sound like Hendrix. Then he made a joke of how it sounded nothing like he thought it did it when the drugs wore off.   Also, the myriad of ohhhhh's after the first verse of Give the Mule What He Wants is beautiful."
qotsa,2ojwkm,TkMill1,3,Sun Dec 7 20:21:17 2014 UTC,"Hispanic impressions is the perfect interlude to the end of the album and just keeps you enticed by the mesmerizing beat and freestyle-ish instruments.  Give the mule what he wants is just a great jamming song. It fits perfectly in the album, and the bass in the intro riff and the verse riff is amazing. It's a controlled, yet high energy, all-in song. It's not the very best, but it's up there, and contributes a lot to the quality of the album."
qotsa,2ojwkm,Shadow_Struck,3,Sun Dec 7 15:23:38 2014 UTC,"Hispanic Impressions: Adventures in time signatures.  When I first heard Mule, I was surprised that there was only one 'chorus'. It's the strongest part of the song in my opinion, but I can see why Josh chose to just keep the riff going to the end. It's a very strong song, it's just that the other songs on S/T are even stronger, so it tends to be forgotten most of the time. Definitely underrated."
qotsa,2ojwkm,Karrottz,2,Wed Dec 10 22:50:22 2014 UTC,"I don't really think that that part's supposed to be a chorus, it's more of a bridge to keep the song from being the same thing for 3 minutes."
qotsa,2ojwkm,CeleryDistraction,2,Wed Dec 10 23:25:52 2014 UTC,"Both of these aren't songs I often go out of my way to listen to... But when they come on as I listen to the S/T I'm happy to hear them.   I'd actually like to hear some more pure instrumental songs from QOTSA like Hispanic impressions. The band can jam and sometimes it's great to just get lost in that that without the guidance of lyrics. Even just one on their next album and I'd be thrilled!  These songs kinda capture the reason I love QOTSA even the songs that could be considered filler are very solid. Most of their work is fantastic but that means lots of good songs often get overlooked, which I think is the case here. Hell just thinking about them makes me wanna listen to their S/T album. Which I think I'll do right now."

qotsa,2odi46,Wizard-in--Black,9,Fri Dec 5 16:30:45 2014 UTC,"The debut album is probably the closest thing we'll get to a solo album; he played every instrument aside from drums.   Whereas that album was fairly heavy desert rock if he were to do a solo album today, I could actually see him going more 'pop'. Silly stuff like 'I'm designer' or 'leg of lamb'"
qotsa,2odi46,shaggyjong,2,Fri Dec 5 16:51:45 2014 UTC,I agree with this sentiment.  I don't think you could say Josh was working within any QOTSA sounding boundaries on this album.
qotsa,2odi46,Sephtical,2,Fri Dec 5 18:47:09 2014 UTC,"I met Josh once with my brother, and we asked about the first album. Josh said while he didn't record the drums, he actually composed parts of it, and dictated how he wanted Alfredo to play . He just wasn't a good enough drummer to record it. He said something technical about drumming that I didn't understand, something about the alternating pattern of the kick drum with the toms (I'll ask my bro, he's a drummer so he should remember it) that is present through the album being something he composed, really liked and told Alfredo to play (if you compare the drums song to song on the album you can hear what I mean. It's the duh-bah-duhduh-bah in Avon, or the duhduh-bah duhduh-bah duh-duh-bah duhduh-bah in if only, where the duhs are toms or the snare and buh is the kick drum).  You hear the duhduh-bah-duhduh pattern throughout the album in slightly different variations.  I hope this makes sense.  So in a lot of ways that first album is Josh's solo album.  But I think now, being older and in a different place in his life, it would sound different, but I don't know in which way."
qotsa,2odi46,SomethingToDanceTo,6,Sat Dec 6 11:20:59 2014 UTC,"You're absolutely right that it would be weird, Homme has stated that he relies heavily on give-and-take between the band members. While QOTSA might as well be a revolving door for awesome musicians, they are all absolutely huge contributors to the writing process."
qotsa,2odi46,BassSolo,5,Fri Dec 5 16:42:39 2014 UTC,"Also, I think the whole 'revolving-door' idea is less true than it used to be.  The current line up has been pretty solid for quite a few years now.  Apart from Jon, there hasn't been a lineup change for almost 8 years.  I think that has really made the inter-band writing process a lot stronger which I why I think a solo album would be so different to another QOTSA album."

I'll post it to /r/vinyl later tonight after work and see what they can come up with.  Also, now that the RekordsRekords forum bit the dust, where is the main QOTSA forum?

They can be a bit hands-off, but if this guy isn't going to budge, for the amount of money you paid you really need to get some major bucks back.  Seriously, get in contact with them before time runs out, don't waste any more time talking to him, just start a dialogue with paypal, because 40 days after the purchase you can't ask for a refund.

I find it kind of sad that I'll be doing it only 3 transactions deep into my discogs account. :/  Until this is resolved in my favour I'll refrain from posting the seller's name.

Brody has since washed over it with ""I'd just advise that you never marry a man that much your senior""  She makes cool music, but it will always have an air of ""latch on to a popular male musician and you will get tangential fans from that relationship"".  The only reason I follow Brody Dalle's social media is that she constantly posts QOTSA stuff.   Just calling a spade a spade here."

That said, QOTSA probably had the strongest set besides Radiohead which isn't quite a fair comparison considering Nigel co-produced the majority of the songs they performed.

I heard different songs from various albums, but once I heard Songs for the Deaf in its entirety...it was like everything I thought I had previously known about music was wrong. That shit changed everything.  From there, I got into Eagles of Death Metal (my first tattoo was actually the hands off the cover of Peace Love Death Metal, I also have a ""Go With the Flow"" tattoo that I've posted here before), then Them Crooked Vultures, then The Mark Lanegan Band (Bubblegum is my favorite album of all time), then Desert Sessions, then Kyuss...  May 2010, I saw TCV at the Aragon Ballroom in Chicago. April 2011, saw Queens for the first time at the Riviera (got to very briefly meet Josh, he signed my ticket but sadly my ex has it). Then again in December 2013 at Allstate Arena. Then again on Cinco de Mayo this year at the Aragon (they played ""Fun Machine"", my life is fucking complete).  I suppose they're my favorite because no matter what other music I'm introduced to or how many times I see them or how much I listen to their music, they never bore me. I'm never like, ""Man, I've listened to Lullabies too much this week, I think I'm gonna take a break.""

I've loved them more than any other band I can think of (even during my teenagegirlfeelings phase where I was so intense about everything). I can't really explain it but they speak to me in more ways than other bands have. I can't think of any other band out there that's as unique as them. I love the melodies, I love the use of false endings, I love the riffs. Even their terrible songs are really good and their good songs are great.

qotsa,2nzp99,ninger6,10,Tue Dec 2 17:56:14 2014 UTC,"It only happened recently (Roll back to March),  I was going to see my favourite band, Nine Inch Nails at Rod Laver Arena, Melbourne.  They were playing along with QOTSA on the Aus/NZ tour and I'd heard about them a bit from my dad who was a fan of theirs, he has all the albums (which I didn't know at the time, I only saw a couple of them, oh and apart from ...Like Clockwork).   So I was interested to see what they sounded like, our tastes of music crossed over sometimes, more-so now but yeah that's because of QOTSA.   My friend sent me a setlist they did previously, so I went though a few of the songs to get used to it, I wasn't focusing properly that much, but I did recognise No One Knows and Burn The Witch when they played them live.  And holyshit. They were good live. One thing that really sold me was The Vampyre of Time and Memory, never heard it before that live experience.  The first line and I was actually tearing up a bit. That song hit me hard. For the rest of it? I didn't want their set to end. I was worrying that they'd actually trumped Nine Inch Nails before they even started playing (they were completely different and both fantastic so I can't compare their sets thankfully, you really need to see NIN live though).   The next day I grabbed all the CDs Dad had, ripped them onto iTunes, downloaded ...Like Clockwork, and chucked them on my iPod, I just started going though the songs on shuffle, all of them.  I think my interest in the albums went something like Songs for the Deaf - Lullabies to Paralyse - ...Like Clockwork - Era Vulgaris - Rated R, I do like the Debut but I've never found it really my favourite out of the lot. But being obsessed with the albums over and over again, I just knew that they were becoming a favourite of mine. I ended up buying ...LC about a week or something after the concert.  So yeah, I kind of just dumped all their music on my head once I saw them live, and loved it ever since."

When I saw Lanegan was involved in this QOTSA project, I had to give it a listen and I got hooked.   Started off with Lullabies and then Songs for the Deaf and played the hell out of both until they had grown on me to the point that I began inhaling pretty much any QOTSA I could get.   I'm still partial to the more ""accessible"" music QOTSA does like If I Had A Tail and Make It Wit Chu but every song (literally) has grown on me to the point that I sit in awe of the diverse structure of each song on every album.   What used to be my least favorite QOTSA songs - the covers like Going Out West, Might Like You Better, and that Bob Dylan tune - have started to grow on me. Still not crazy about Christian Brothers though.   QOTSA fandom got me into Eagles of Death Metal but I've still not gotten a chance to check out Kyuss, which is lame but I'm sure I'll get there."

qotsa,2nzp99,Mutatedkitty,2,Tue Dec 2 04:30:19 2014 UTC,"There's this huge circle jerk among most music fans around ""good musicians"": people that can play a whole bunch of notes in a really small amount of time. Now, sure, it's all very entertaining to see someone play an instrument like a machine, but that's not what music is about. The same way that movies shouldn't be about the explosion count, or video games shouldn't be about how many polygons are on the screen, music, like, any other art, shouldn't be about how quickly your guitarist can play a solo, or the range of notes your singer can hit, or the highest tempo your drummer can keep a beat to. It should be about emotion and the feel of your music, even if you aren't the best at what you're playing. Queens of the Stone Age is about that."

qotsa,2nzp99,crocodome,2,Tue Dec 2 06:49:19 2014 UTC,"If anybody actually cares to read this, there is a little chain of bands that led me to QotSA. I first started listening to the band Wolfmother after playing that racing game Flatout 2 on PS2. I got really into them (their self-titled album is a fantastic freaking album) and was reading about them on Wikipedia. In the Wikipedia article, there was a interview that was referenced in which they named Kyuss as one of their influences and I thought, ""Wow, that is a weird band name. How do you even pronounce that""?   So I googled Kyuss and the first song that came up was Demon Cleaner. I gave it a listen and all I could think was, ""My God, what are these sensations I am feeling? This feels so right""! So I then got really into Kyuss.  After a while of listening to them and having them on Pandora, some QotSA songs like Go With The Flow and No One Knows would pop up on my Pandora. I eventually looked more into QotSA and the rest is history. I became a gigantic QotSA/Homme fanboy. I have seen QotSA twice live, and am into EODM and TCV. I mean, how could I not be?  What enthralls me so much about QotSA, if I am being honest, is the persona if Homme. He is a funny guy, a phenomenal guitar player, and the last true rock star. Not to mention he can come up with one hell of a riff. The last unexplored Homme frontier for me is the Desert Sessions. I have listened to probably 10% to 15% of assorted tracks from all of those albums.  As an aside, QotSA was actually the inspiration for me to learn guitar. I listened to the riffs and was like, ""I WILL know how to play these. I must learn them!"" and so I started slowly teaching myself guitar.   TLDR A really cool story, bro."
qotsa,2nzp99,Wizard-in--Black,1 point,Tue Dec 2 21:31:14 2014 UTC,"Honestly, you need to listen to the desert sessions.  They're unpredictable, a bit challenging at times, but so, so good."
qotsa,2nzp99,AcesCreed2,2,Thu Dec 4 18:46:24 2014 UTC,"So I'd say that QOTSA is my second favorite band. Pink Floyd is first for sentimental reasons, but that's a different story.  To be honest, my history with Queens goes back at least six years but doesn't come into play until about the beginning of the summer of 2013. I say six years because my first exposure to their music was the inclusion of ""Go With the Flow"" on the first Rock Band in like 2008. I enjoyed the song quite a bit but didn't think much of it. I also bought one of the Rock Band track packs, and it happened to have Little Sister on it. I had previously seen the SNL episode featuring Queens, so I knew the song and thought it was kind of cool. I bought Rock Band 3 when it came out two years later, and was a little skeptical with their song choice (No One Knows). I didn't really like the song at first, and really didn't enjoy it for a while.  This all changed in early-mid 2013. I was introduced to stoner rock by a friend, so I was getting into really heavy music like Electric Wizard, Kyuss, Bongripper, Neurosis, and Cult of Luna. I think I was on r/stonerrock when I saw someone asking about how to get into QOTSA. The name was really familiar, and I thought why the hell not, since Kyuss was (and still is) one of my favorite bands. I downloaded the self-titled and Rated R, and enjoyed them. I think the songs that I really fell in love with were Auto Pilot and In the Fade. (I didn't really like the self-titled until recently, it just started to click on a really long drive.)   So as this was happening, ...Like Clockwork was announced. I thought to myself, great timing. I downloaded it a couple days after it came out. My god, this album was a fucking REVELATION. I instantly fell in love with it, listening to it two or three times a week. I still love it, and it's in my top ten albums of all time. Then, the tour was announced...  So the show I saw was the 8/15/13 show at Red Rocks. I went in expecting a cool show, just some rock and roll. Nothing special. I remember talking to the person next to me about how awesome the opener (Gogol Bordello) was, and she smiled and said ""Just wait."" As we waited for Queens, I learned more about her. Turns out she lived in Joshua Tree and worked in LA in the music business, but was a Colorado native like me. She talked about how she sold Mikey Shoes weed a lot and how fucking crazy Josh is. I started to realize that the desert is where I wanted to be. The whole scene was awesome.  So the show finally started. Epic fucking set. I remember telling some guy in line that I was sad they weren't gonna play In the Fade, but I didn't care. But after Vampyre, those immortal guitar chords rang out in the amphitheater. I lost my shit. Everyone lost their shit. From that point forward, I knew this was the best concert I will ever see. I remember grooving to Smooth Sailing, shouting along to Burn the Witch's riff, and headbanging like a motherfucker during A Song for the Dead. As me and my friend drove away from the venue, we were dumbfounded. It took us a little bit to process what happened. Fucking insanity. I've been to a bunch more shows since the Red Rocks date (the next band I actually saw was Vista Chino, or Kyuss Lives, that was pretty cool), but none except for the recent Death From Above 1979 show have really met the high bar set by the Queens show. I logically found TCV and EoDM after, alongside the Desert Sessions. But I consider myself a Queens fan for life."
qotsa,2nzp99,sexdrugsncarltoncole,2,Wed Dec 3 02:21:52 2014 UTC,They are just the greatest band in existance. Every piece of work they have done has been so diverse and top quality. Even my least favourite album of theirs is mostly amazing. I'm not even a massive rock fan
qotsa,2nzp99,BURN-THE-WITCH,2,Wed Dec 3 13:08:59 2014 UTC,"QOTSA is by far my favorite band, for many of the same reasons as you listed, but i guess i could say a bit more. On the christmas of my freshman year in high school (which was last year, yeah I'm a young'n) one of my friends gave me the cd of Like Clockwork, and at the time i had heard no songs by them, and had only heard of them in passing occasionally. But i gave it a listen and got instantly hooked. From there i got a copy of SFTD (from the same friend actually, he ordered one from amazon and they sent him two copies) and loved it as well. Then in January of this year (seems a lot longer ago) me, the previously mentioned friend, and two of my other friends saw them when they came to South Carolina. After that show i fully explored their entire discography and now here i am. Everything you said is spot on, no other band i've heard has the adaptability and skill of Queens."

I love their riff-oriented style with all the different sounds they make.  There's not a single Qotsa song I don't like, Josh Homme is my hero and if anyone ever compared me to him in a positive way I think my life would be complete"
qotsa,2nzp99,speedy_delivery,2,Tue Dec 2 02:22:43 2014 UTC,"Not my -absolute- favorite band, but way up there. I'd always kinda known about them, I think I'm one of the younger people on this sub (and I just joined it, so I feel like I've been posting too much ) so I played video games that had their music in it in like, middle school. I never really listened to them, but I'd known that Homme worked with Arctic Monkeys (my #1 favorite band) and so I was willing to listen to more stuff.   A few months before ...like clockwork came out I was listening to ""The blond-o-sonic shimmer trap"" by Arctic Monkeys (I'm on mobile so I can't link the song) and I instantly recognized the influence in the song. I loved their heavier stuff, so I decided to listen to the source.   And then ""My god is the sun"" the Boneface animations came out and I was looking forward every day that week to watching them and listened to them on repeat.  Time passed and now I'm here :)"
qotsa,2nzp99,MattN92,2,Tue Dec 2 02:32:24 2014 UTC,"Definitely my favorite band. No one else really embodies what I want in my rock stars and music these days, but Josh really has it dialed in where I like it. It's kind of hard to explain other than QOTSA is serious hard rock that's confident enough in its awesomeness so that they don't take themselves so seriously that they get caught up in the macho bullshit where a lot of rock and metal bands lose me.   My first encounter was on a late night on a weekend back home from college my sophomore year in 2002, back when MTV still had shit worth watching. I wasn't really paying attention, but I looked up and saw what I thought was Dave Grohl behind a drum kit in a cool, weird video of a song with a good groove. The video reminded me a lot of Everlong, and no shock, it was No One Knows. I was pleasantly surprised.   I dug into the internet in the days following, found the song, confirmed that was definitely Dave, and a week later I bought Songs for the Deaf in a half drunken/half stoned fog. I listened to that album top to bottom for weeks. Bought it, hook, line, sinker. From there out there was kind of a passive interest from '03 to '07ish. I was poor and didn't go out and consume as much as I might have been able to (I think I only bought Rated R during that lull). But I did see them in 2003 on the Lolapalooza tour when they stopped in Burgettstown. They were okay, but for whatever reason I wasn't too excited about the show, they came on and off without too much fanfare. I look back on it as a squandered opportunity. I wouldn't see them play for another decade.  Fast forward to 2007 and I bought a new phone that was also my first mp3 player. I dumped a big file of music on there which included everything through Lullabies, Kyuss, the Desert Sessions, and EODM. It was here that I delved into the vast Homme library, and my appreciation for the man and the music he involves himself with. There's very little of it I don't like, though I admit, I'm not big on Kyuss cause I can't stand Garcia's vocals. BUT I'm down with about 85-95% of the stuff I've heard.  This period coincided with some serious existential crises, depression, increased substance use, yada, yada. I'd like to say that I'm completely on the other side of it, but it's more like I'm past the point of no return and have to keep moving forward. Nothing special, really. Everyone has trouble but I'm in an okay place, even if it isn't perfect.   I got to see them a year ago in September for the second time in Asheville, which was a great time. A few days to visit friends there, a big careless party, and topped by a great show. More chaos after that, but through it all, QOTSA has been the soundtrack to it, and it's been a blessing."

And for me it's little details like how a band carries themselves that makes the difference between ""bands I like"" and ""absolute favourites"".

That year, 2003, I was fortunate enough to see them live a couple times and was most definitely hooked. The first time I saw them Turbonegro opened for them, which blew my mind, then came Josh, Nick, Mark, Troy, and Joey. The show they put on, to this day, is the greatest performance I've ever seen. The combination of Josh, Mark, and Nick taking turns singing and jamming the songs, it was as if the gates of heaven opened up and there I was, witnessing God. I bought Rated R and S/T the next day and streamed those three albums for the next 3 years.   Since the departure of Nick and Mark, I feel there has been a substantial drop off in diversity, while continuing to maintain quality, however. Their presence in the band, IMO, did wonders for Josh and his songwriting. In the years since, while I've enjoyed the albums, they hardly feel like QOTSA albums. More or less Josh Homme albums.   So, while they are no longer my favorite band, their first three albums remain my favorite trilogy of albums ever and that period of time in which they performed them hold my fondest memories of live music."

This all changed when the first time I got stoned Little Sister came onto my ipod from shuffle and it was one of the most interesting things i've ever heard. Of course right then and there I made a note to look into all their music. I obviously got started on the S/T record and was enraptured by their music. It was the heavy riffage, the unique vocals. Heck I was a troubled teen (who isn't) and Queens was always there for me to listen to. They've been this ever present force in my life. Saying I'm obsessive about Queens of the stone agewould be an understatement. I've seen them live 3 times so far and plan on going to many more.

I may jump around from binging on one band to the next pretty quickly but Queens were always my first musical passion and I can always come back to them and expect to still be blown away.   Also, they're probably the only band with more than 2 studio albums that I can't name a single song i dislike (I'd say I love my other two favourite bands, Muse and Soundgarden, as much as Queens but they both have a few songs I can't bring myself to listen to.)"

The rhythm is amazing on that track for how slow of a song it is and I think what Dave added was genius. The whole album wasn't really created for a drummer to go wild. Drummers are a part of a band because they can drastically change the mood. I don't see any room for a drum track like Song for the Dead. The track in the beginning of that song was sampled from a Black Flag album for christ sakes! Josh wasn't looking to go fast and loud with like clockwork. He wanted it to feel slow, droopy, and sad.

qotsa,2nwbuh,Gaminic,1 point,Mon Dec 1 16:08:14 2014 UTC,"Very original!  The singer has a great voice, but I don't really like it for this song. Partly because it's overpowered by the music in the louder parts, but also because it's ""too smooth"". The song requires some edge to work."
qotsa,2nwbuh,dankyflam,1 point,Mon Dec 1 13:07:35 2014 UTC,Pretty neat. I wish that the percussion and bass sections were better arranged though. Certainly could've used some more dynamics on the low end to contrast the excellence of the rest of the orchestra.

qotsa,2nujas,Wizard-in--Black,6,Sun Nov 30 17:58:25 2014 UTC,This song was the sound of my anticipation and excitement for Like Clockwork... building up over months. Love it.

I like the song, don't get me wrong, it's solid, but it just isn't as strong as a lot of the other songs they've put out. One I won't fast forward through if it comes on, but not one I'd specifically seek out to listen to."
qotsa,2nujas,notactuallyjoshhomme,3,Mon Dec 1 14:10:58 2014 UTC,"The little interlude before the second chorus is awesome. Other than that, this is one of the less impactful LC tracks in my opinion. I must say though- learning to play it on guitar definitely made me like it more. There's a lot of subtle harmonies that really elevate the tune when you can pick them out individually. Made me see the song in a whole new way."
qotsa,2nujas,dankyflam,3,Tue Dec 2 04:03:43 2014 UTC,"Ehhh, it's fine, I guess. I might just not like it that much just because it's one of two songs on LC that isn't a god damned home run."
qotsa,2nujas,LuneofMoths,2,Wed Dec 3 02:53:37 2014 UTC,"I don't love this song to be honest. I'd probably rank it a bottom 3 song on ....Like clockwork. It actually surprised me that this is the big radio song on the album, it's just not that special. At least compared to their other big singles likes 3s & 7s, Little Sister, Go with the Flow and of course No One Knows. I have a feeling this will be a song that stays on their concert set list long even after the move away from LC centric shows; which is kinda were my feeling of it being overrated comes from.  That's being said it's still a solid song, I like it in the context of the album. It's just never grown on me, I don't get excited when it comes on like I do for 95% of their songs.   It's probably a 7/10 in my books, which makes it a good song but nothing special from a band as great as QOTSA."
qotsa,2nujas,CeleryDistraction,2,Tue Dec 2 05:03:57 2014 UTC,I'll never forget driving through the freeway on the way to Disneyland at 8 in the morning and seeing a giant sun in the distance while this song played on the radio. That image is just forever in my mind.

qotsa,2nqgck,SynysterSaint,3,Sat Nov 29 08:59:29 2014 UTC,I think it's like that on purpose. Since the album is the drive from l.a. To Joshua Tree in desert the further away from the city and into the desert you get weirder and creepier things get.
qotsa,2nqgck,Taydolf_Switler22,4,Sun Nov 30 03:15:24 2014 UTC,"Just recently blasted this one and it is such an underrated song of theirs.  So sinister and chilling.  I imagine hearing it live would lead to some pants shitting.    I think songs like these that aren't super screamo metal are what's missing from music.  Some people want to hear evil shit, but also want to hear some melody.  This is a perfect blend of that."

I absolutely love Like Clockwork - it's probably my favourite QotSA album, but I don't know if I agree with this. I'm not a huge fan of their first album and the material that came before, and it seems like there's a world of difference between Lullabies and LC.  They've stuck to their roots to some extent, but it's an odd thing to say about them. Definitely not a defining feature, and not as true as it would be for some other bands on that list - Weezer? Foo Fighters?"

qotsa,2nbw3w,gnice3d,3,Tue Nov 25 05:33:52 2014 UTC,I personally don't think you could leave Millionaire off any top 10 list.  Besides that it's whatever.
qotsa,2nbw3w,Sephtical,3,Tue Nov 25 19:58:02 2014 UTC,"My top 10 includes maybe 3 of these, but still, not bad. Also, I understand it takes commercial success into account, but leaving off A Song For The Dead? Not even an honourable mention?! That makes no sense to me. I get that some people don't love it, but it's the concert-closer."
qotsa,2nbw3w,notactuallyjoshhomme,3,Tue Nov 25 22:14:20 2014 UTC,I think they may have been trying to avoid songs with Lanegan on vocals. I don't know why they'd do that but it's my theory.
qotsa,2nbw3w,Pqqtone,2,Wed Nov 26 01:41:15 2014 UTC,"We should take into account one of the major criteria was commercial success, so of course it's going to full of radio-friendly stuff."
qotsa,2nbw3w,CaptHayes,2,Tue Nov 25 10:52:14 2014 UTC,"not exactly my top 10, but I gotta give props for including Mexicola for example. although I could imagine e.g. Millionaire or Make it Wit Chu instead of some, but hey, if I were about to introduce them to someone, I'd have no regrets using this video. to each their own I guess."

qotsa,2nbw3w,Namrhof,1 point,Tue Nov 25 06:12:57 2014 UTC,"Not that we should've expected anything different, but even the ""deeper cuts"" on this list are only on the verge of obscurity when looking at their discography as a whole. Kudos to them for trying to not just list singles (I guess?), but even tunes like Better Living get vastly more popular street cred than, let's say, EVERY other track off of R.  Also strange of them to take note of Oliveri's presence but not list any of his songs? Once again, this is a very surface level list. Understood, but feels more like a quickly assembled singles discography/history lesson with a few attempts to seem knowledgable into the obscure.  They should've referred to r/qotsa for help on this, haha."

Not only does this feature some sexy-ass vocals from Josh in his illustrious falsetto, but it has some simple, yet incredible bass from JPJ and Dave fucking kills it in the second half. It also has what may be my favourite bridge. I wasn't lucky enough to see them on tour, but I have heard how insane it gets when Josh says the ""Huh"" before the last section. This song is a masterpiece, nuff said."
qotsa,2n5wgr,notactuallyjoshhomme,4,Sun Nov 23 17:46:27 2014 UTC,"First TCV song I listened to, has always been my favorite. The perfect blend of sexual innuendos with classic Joshua Homme head-banging rock, with a cowbell part as icing on the cake. Orgasms every time 2:44 rolls up, precisely on the ""UHH."" Easily one of his finest moments. Please, dearest Gods of rock, please give us more. Signed, everyone ever."
qotsa,2n5wgr,appleheadg,4,Mon Nov 24 04:52:53 2014 UTC,"I think compared with a lot of the other songs on the album NLMANDI is one for the casual listeners.  I hate to say this as it sounds like I hate this song, which I don't, but it would be in my bottom five for that album.  Compared with longer tracks (Elephant, Warsaw, Daffodils etc), I think it's one weaker tracks.  Having said that, it's such a great album that it's still an amazing track and that moment at 2:44 when he goes ""UHHHH"" and that riff kicks in is fucking incredible."
qotsa,2n5wgr,Karrottz,2,Sun Nov 23 16:40:52 2014 UTC,"After New Fang and Mind Eraser, No Chaser were released as singles, this is the first song I heard from the rest of the album. Man, that second part of the song is one of the most badass things I've ever heard, even from Josh. It sent chills down my spine and still does.  It's a special song now. I can't listen to it constantly like I can, say, Reptiles, but that's what makes it so much better when I do."
qotsa,2n5wgr,Sniper_Extreme,2,Sun Nov 23 20:30:46 2014 UTC,"I'm not a fan of the sound of the first half of the song; the lyrics are incredible, but it's sort of overshadowed by the second half.  That ""Ugh!"" is probably the greatest moment on TCV."
qotsa,2n5wgr,bonsaiisuperstar,2,Tue Nov 25 16:15:05 2014 UTC,The only song that I used as an alarm clock tune and it didn't annoy me once. I remember when they released the sample of this before it officially came out and just being blown away by the instruments. Heavy powerful stuff.
qotsa,2n79qz,Shadow_Struck,5,Sun Nov 23 21:55:18 2014 UTC,With no doubt at all Queens. As much respect as I have for TCV  Queens for me is at another level; one album cannot trounce a legacy.

qotsa,2n79qz,vincientjames,1 point,Sun Nov 23 22:48:52 2014 UTC,"TCV. Lyrically and riff-wise, Josh is so much more of a powerhouse with TCV. And Dr. G back on the kit? And John Paul Jones? For me, that self-titled album rivals all Josh had done with Queens up until 2005, because he used almost all of the elements of his musical progression. And did I mention Dave on drums? Josh may have even tried to recreate the Vultures mindset going into Era Vulgaris, and just couldn't quite pull it off with the Queens lineup.  The four members of TCV (yes I include Alain, he's a brilliant musician and producer) created a masterpiece. I have enough trust in their abilities to think that they could do it again. And I hope they do.   And seriously, Dave on drums...  edit: poor timeline skills"

qotsa,2my69f,KRAXON,7,Fri Nov 21 08:42:34 2014 UTC,"Absolutely agree. It's one of the most uniquely written songs I've heard in a while, in terms of concept. No worries, you're in good company."
qotsa,2my69f,SuperSaverLillian,7,Fri Nov 21 10:26:54 2014 UTC,"Agreed. Plus I love the story Josh tells (I wish I had the video link) about how Reptile's riff was the first thing Josh had showed JPJ when he entered the studio to write. The way he tells it I remember being hilarious, that Josh pulls out this weird-ass riff immediately making JPJ think ""what the hell have I gotten myself into?""  *edit: I found that interview here, link takes you right to 4:14 when he brings up Reptiles, but two things: First, it's not so much a story as a joke, my memory fails me a bit (I think the last time I watched this was just before or just after the album was released). And second, watch the entire interview, it's hilarious!  **edit2: here's the ""sequel"" to that interview (looking up TCV on yt earlier put me on a nonstop footage kick); I'm calling it a sequel because they reference the interview above at least once. Plus you get to see Josh flirting with the sexy black chick the whole time...she was all for it too, it's also hilarious! I was waiting for her to drop her panties at any moment."
qotsa,2my69f,rapemybones,4,Fri Nov 21 14:21:57 2014 UTC,"I haven't seen that interview and if anyone has a video link, I would appreciate it.  My favorite Reptiles bit is this. At the very beginning, you can read Dave Grohl's lips saying,"" I didn't know that. Did you know that?"" So funny."

qotsa,2my69f,HelplessHeathen,3,Fri Nov 21 23:51:10 2014 UTC,That's the performance that convinced me none of it was metaphorical and just might actually be a song about humans being enslaved in the future!

I feel like a lot of the album has a very repetitive, energized, tight feel, but in the middle is something that's extremely relaxed and almost falling apart. Even just stand alone, I think it's one of my favorite Homme's ever done. Sad to see it fall to a very certain last place."
qotsa,2my69f,schwoogiejoe24,3,Fri Nov 21 19:01:44 2014 UTC,"Pleasantly surprised at how high spinning in the daffodils is. The riff at the end of that one is really cool.

qotsa,2mpyie,SynysterSaint,2,Thu Nov 20 00:43:22 2014 UTC,"Right. That's why i said,  ""I don't think it was intentional, or a cash grab."" I am guessing either you didn't see that, or misread what I said.   I've been a fan of Josh since Kyuss, before QOTSA even existed. I've seen them countless times (I think about 30-some) since 1999. I've seen them in six countries and 10 states. I've met them a number of times, and Josh has always been so incredibly kind. We are also the same age. So Josh has been a huge part of my life for the last 20 years. If he had not pulled through, I would have been devastated. A huge part of my life would be over. So I agree and fully understand that the album is quite emotional. ""I Appear Missing"" particularly hits me hard.   However, I still think it's more mainstream (in my opinion and by my definition) than any of their other albums. Especially ""Vampyre."" That's a personal opinion, obviously, and you're free to disagree. It's also one shared by many of the other mega QOTSA fans I've known and traveled with (many of whom despise the album). Does that make it right? No. It's just an opinion. And i don't see ""maintstream"" as a negative like so many people  seem to do.   I disagree that the other albums lack emotional songwriting. I offer Sky Is Falling as only one example."
qotsa,2mpyie,hailingburningbones,2,Thu Nov 20 17:34:19 2014 UTC,"Yeah I don't think Josh would ever do an album just for the sake of money. Maybe i'm just biased, or naive, but I think if that was his goal, he definitely could have achieved it by now.  I definitely think there's some subjectivity as to which albums feel more emotional than others. I think it's partially based on how much you can relate to it, or what you're going through at the time. I was going through a pretty tough time when SFTD came out, so it feels pretty heavy to me.   I also feel a lot of emotion in Lullabies, especially I Never Came and Broken Box. Sounds like a painful breakup happened there!"
qotsa,2mpyie,hailingburningbones,2,Thu Nov 20 18:51:29 2014 UTC,"In terms of emotional albums, I think this may be specifically be broken down into two parts: emotion to the listener and to the artist. In the terms I suppose I was trying to get across was for the Josh, which is true, does not need to be reflected to the listener.  I think what makes LC hit a lot of QOTSA fans is seeing Josh feel the most vulnerable after many years of rockin'. To me, it's like Josh realized his own mortality, but yes, I do see how this may be subjective in it's own way.  I do appreciate your loyalty to QOTSA though, It's really cool you've met him in person and have seen some of his shows. I myself have not been so lucky yet, but It's definitely cool to see rational opinions made from Queen's long devoted fans."
qotsa,2mpyie,msdcc,0,Thu Nov 20 19:12:59 2014 UTC,I don't think it is. Many of the songs aren't really something you'd listen to individually but in the grand scheme of the album are fantastic.
qotsa,2mpyie,Diasl,11,Thu Nov 20 19:16:48 2014 UTC,"Honestly, I'll take whatever the fuck they feel like making.

qotsa,2mpyie,lordhuggington,5,Wed Nov 19 22:47:35 2014 UTC,"I think that's the plan.   ""During an interview with The Skinny, Homme used Iggy Pop‘s celebrated work in Berlin in the late Seventies as an inspiration for his future plans, when the Stooges frontman recorded and released the LPs ‘The Idiot‘ and ‘Lust For Life‘ within a year of each other.  “Part of me thinks it would be great if this was the point-counterpoint that ‘The Idiot’ and ‘Lust For Life’ are, y’know?” he said. “I love those records so much; they came out in a quick period of time. ‘The Idiot’ is very dark and ‘Lust For Life’ is sorta like ‘Tah-daaah!’.

QOTSA's best bass lines were written by Josh (S/T). Joey really knew exactly what to play on LtP and Era, his drum beats have an almost ""singable"" quality. Not to mention the tracks he did for LC have arguably the most interesting drums on the album. Don't get me started on his live playing tempo though haha.  Have you got any links to videos where Nick was carrying the song and Josh was just jamming?"
qotsa,2mpyie,Diasl,8,Wed Nov 19 05:54:54 2014 UTC,I 100% hope they do.
qotsa,2mpyie,vgman20,6,Wed Nov 19 16:07:42 2014 UTC,Yeah. But I really enjoyed Like Clockwork. It was a damn good Queens album and it really fit what Josh Homme was going for based on his life experiences the last few years.
qotsa,2mpyie,BinaryChode,3,Thu Nov 20 00:00:58 2014 UTC,"I want something heavy,  hard, fast and slightly repetitive. Songs like six shooter and millionaire!"
qotsa,2mpyie,Dramaticnoise,1 point,Thu Nov 20 20:38:48 2014 UTC,"Really? Interesting, I hate six shooter, and while I really like millionaire, I wouldn't want an album full of it. I want weird, cool heaviness, like the chorus to Someone's in the Wolf (I'm listening to that right now which is why it came to mind right away)."
qotsa,2mpyie,TheReverendWillyG,2,Wed Nov 19 00:33:05 2014 UTC,"Yes big time, the heavy stuff is queens for me. If someone asked what queens album should I listen to in order get an idea of what the band is. I would chose one of the first 3 albums. I enjoyed Like Clock work I thought it was a very good cohesive album but I find myself listening to the older queens songs more often than the newer stuff. I think the days of heavy queens are done, people get older and they get softer. I also like the older dirtier more distorted sound. The newer stuff sounds too polished and clean sounding. Still very good but I prefer the older stuff"
qotsa,2mpyie,clozan10,2,Wed Nov 19 03:58:10 2014 UTC,I 100% agree with you.  Like Clockwork was their big production record.  Im ready to return to garage hard rock.
qotsa,2mpyie,headless_bourgeoisie,2,Wed Nov 19 22:49:06 2014 UTC,MORE UPBEAT! I missed that signature double time.
qotsa,2mpyie,BinaryChode,2,Thu Nov 20 08:25:58 2014 UTC,"Knowing Qotsa track record, its anyones guess, but I reckon they are going to bring in more of an influence from John Theodore (drummer).  Who knows what kind of feel will come across in their next project, but you can be reassured that it will be different in the identifiable Qotsa style."

qotsa,2mpyie,MrSaladFork,5,Thu Nov 20 07:34:50 2014 UTC,I was disappointed immensely with Like Clockwork. It's tame and lacks the QOTSA sound.
qotsa,2mpyie,MigElite,11,Wed Nov 19 03:24:16 2014 UTC,"People should not downvote you for having an opinion. I like most of the album, but it's definitely my least favorite. And I've been a fan from day one."
qotsa,2mpyie,Approval_Guy,4,Wed Nov 19 03:27:57 2014 UTC,"I noticed that after a couple of listen-throughs, but to me it made it a stronger album overall. It wasn't the QOTSA I was used to, but it hit me like a ton of bricks and sent me on a wild ride of raw emotion.   Very few of the songs had the ""unh"" kick/attitude that has become a staple of their music, and it sounded like they tried making up for that by packing it all into Smooth Sailing and trickling it over to If I Had a Tail.   Overall though, I thought ...Like Clockwork was a huge success. They had an idea, transmitted it beautifully, and still maintained most of their identity as a band. Would be nice to see them return to form in their next album as a ""did you miss me?"" type of deal, but I guess only time will tell"
qotsa,2mpyie,amouthforwar,3,Wed Nov 19 04:53:33 2014 UTC,"I don't see that opinion often on this sub but I agree with you wholeheartedly. LC is still good. It's layered and intricate but that's not really what I like about the band. All my favorite shit before LC was their really straightforward, groove-laden, driving songs. This latest album had a lack of those. Or an absence."
qotsa,2mpyie,lightmyfire666,2,Wed Nov 19 00:43:13 2014 UTC,I also like the heavy stuff but IMO ...Like Clockwork is their best album. If they go in the same direction it's gonna be great.
qotsa,2mpyie,skinisblackmetallic,1 point,Wed Nov 19 01:50:38 2014 UTC,"I definitely hope to hear a heavier Queens than what Like Clockwork was.  Josh said that they were shooting for a vocal-centric album to get all the demons cleaned.  I definitely think we'll be getting a distinctively Queens album, though.  However, whatever they end up doing, we won't be expecting it."

qotsa,2mig6w,red157,2,Mon Nov 17 18:47:38 2014 UTC,Yeah I get chills every time.  Its because they bring in those chords that your brain sort of fills in for the rest of the song and then with the slide. MMMM.

qotsa,2mig6w,AbrahamWashington,19,Mon Nov 17 01:41:14 2014 UTC,"Oh boy.   The entire bridge of ""Mosquito Song"". The piano and violin bit, the huge-sounding horns kicking in, and then the strings coming back in, simply incredible. Chilling. The whole conclusion of ""Someone's in the Wolf"", but the last ten seconds or so when the main riff abruptly kicks back in with a vengeance is the most bad-ass thing. And just as soon as it comes back, it's gone. Both instances of the beat kicking in and the abrupt industrial outro in ""Spiders and Vinegaroons"". The intro of ""Misfit Love"". The ""woohoohoos"" in ""Run Pig Run"" get me every time. So deliciously twisted. Also of note, the chorus of that song and the outro.   And I'll stop there before I go crazy."

The solo about 2 minutes in is just insane, and just as it's finished Josh's roar of ""I'm so lost out on the highway"" all comes together perfectly"

Ending of I Appear Missing  When the guitar of Mosquito Song kicks in after the silence  Hearing the echo of the guitar of Another Love Song before it even starts...  That drum beat at the beginning of Turnin' on the Screw  Song for the Dead drums during the chorus, good lord  Drums on Keep Your Eyes Peeled!  And how they break back in after specific parts  Ode to Clarissa...AAAAAAAAAAAOOOOOOOWWWWHHH  Shift to an atmospheric tone of the orchestral outro to Long Slow Goodbye  Sky is Fallin', buildup to the last chorus  The loud guitar sound at the end of Tension Head suddenly being cut off by the start of Lightning Song...just, so beautiful  I will admit, the shift in Misfit Love is pretty awesome, but ~3:00 when the one guitar is all modified and the other is just darting off, that just sounds so badass  Run, Pig, Run, that freaking epic guitar in the chorus  Intro to If I Had a Tail, it's like the perfect prelude to an epic teenage summer or something  Same with the intro to In the Fade, no matter when or where I'll hear that, I'll be reminded of growing up in southern california  2nd and 3rd choruses to Everybody Knows that You're insane, cause that second guitar kicks in  Sword unsheathing, to the intro of The Blood is Love, hilarious  First chorus of Broken Box  The psychedelic guitar + ""I wanna fly I wanna ride with you..."", cheesy but that riff is just delicious   dududu du dududu du dududu DEFAWITHTHERAHFOFTHELAAOOWW.  THis was my first impression of QOTSA that wasn't 3s and 7s or No One Knows, it took some getting used to  Intro to Six Shooter?  Quiet part of God is in the Radio and then the guitar solo, then the quiet again  Walkin on the sidewalks riff  Aaaannd my favorite has to be the break in Keep Your Eyes Peeled with the ""The view from hell is, blue sky, so ominously blu-BUUUUMMM"", just such a beautiful little break in this song, which is pretty overlooked in the QOTSA catelogue in my opinion.  As well that other break with Uuuuuuunderwaaaateeerrrr  Shit, too many.  Sorry guys, but I love this band too fucking much.  They'll always be a symbol of growing up here in San Diego, in the desert, saturday afternoons barbecuing at some dad's friend's in east county in the 2000's.  They're probably the perfect artistic representation of the desert of socal.  Ok, I'm done."

I think the documentary side of this show has been top notch, really digs deep into some awesome music history. I get so bored once the Foo Fighters start playing though. It's like they talk the whole episode about how inspiring this place is, how much it will influence their sound, and then play a boring, middle-of-the-road rock song."
qotsa,2mgukt,mikerastiello,9,Sun Nov 16 15:45:11 2014 UTC,I dig the music but a lot of the vocals seemed forced because Grohl is trying to incorporate stories and phrases he hears. It's a little like lyrics by Mad Libs.

It is one of the best rock documentaries I've seen but the music is far from great.  My problem is that Grohl tries way too hard to work in as many references as he can into each song, to the point that it comes out like a word salad.  I've listened to the album and it's pretty mediocre.  It's a damn shame as I really enjoyed Something From Nothing and the funky hook they incorporated into it.  I feel like Grohl should know better than to write stuff this gimmicky."
qotsa,2mgukt,BinaryChode,8,Sun Nov 16 15:59:14 2014 UTC,"I agree with everything you said, but remember this is an experiment. Grohl is becoming a documentarian, and a damn good one. This is an experiment for HBO, which is suddenly footing the bill for an album recording, and for Grohl who is acting as historian for these locales and their musical footprints. While a lot of it is ""recent,"" largely because of the subjects available for interview and their ages, I think the series is incredible. The album they put out is a byproduct; the miniseries is the real star."

It's laid out in a way that allows Josh to improvise/fiddle around within each verse (i.e. SFTDead), it's got a real funky riff (i.e. Smooth Sailing), even including Mr. JPJ playing clav! Plus catchy lyrics, amazing solos, and is overall impressive & fun to watch live.

As a huge fan of both bands, I was kind of disappointed by Humbug, although I don't think I ever gave it more than a few listens. Crying Lightning was the only song that ever stuck with me. I'm listening to it now, and there are so many QotSA-sounding pieces.  This is Catapult, the single Josh was talking about that he wished made it onto the album. It's brilliant, what were they thinking leaving it  on an unnoticed EP?! It's the perfect mix of both bands' styles."

qotsa,2m8f21,smoktimus_prime,6,Fri Nov 14 00:10:00 2014 UTC,I'm a little sad. Josh has always said he worked very hard to achieve his sound and generally doesn't detail his setup.
qotsa,2m8f21,Taydolf_Switler22,7,Fri Nov 14 01:16:58 2014 UTC,You can have all the right stuff and still not sound anything like him.
qotsa,2m8f21,2tidesaday,1 point,Fri Nov 14 01:23:18 2014 UTC,"Yeah its extremely hard to sound like him.  As a guitarist myself, I've tried and we have some similar pedals, but tone and sound really comes from way more than gear.  Likewise I feel like someone would have trouble sounding like me.  While they would surely be able to play the same notes it would just sound different."
qotsa,2m8f21,rapemybones,1 point,Fri Nov 14 07:35:07 2014 UTC,"you're both right, but also because like many other guitarists (like another favorite, Brian May), Josh has experimented with and uses custom wraps and polarities for each of his pickups; at least Josh's earlier guitars were far from stock. I remember hearing him in an interview talking briefly about it, but to my knowledge he's never released exactly how his pickups are set up. So that's one big secret of his sound that he's keeping to himself."

qotsa,2m8f21,vincientjames,1 point,Fri Nov 14 23:15:39 2014 UTC,It's still true. The list was compiled from gear heads looking at photos and watching live videos. The guitars and amps don't really take anytime at all and most pedals are unique in knob placement and color combinations.  Troy did a rig run down of his pedals last year for a guitar website and they said Josh wouldn't allow any pictures taken of his pedals nor would be discuss them.

I'm just more curious than anything else. Just my 2 cents"

If loads of guitarists could suddenly replicate that, there'd be a wave of RB wannabes."

It's their newest album, it's the most alternative Queens have ever sounded (and so will probably be more up your alley than their more metal-esque albums), and I just feel like it's their most accessible album. In fact ...LC was how I got into Queens myself.  Of course, you could always try Songs for the Deaf first too, though it is much heavier than anything Arctic Monkeys have ever put out. It's still very accessible regardless. I suggest leaving the other albums alone for now though, but you could always listen ahead to some singles from them. I suggest Little Sister from Lullabies to Paralyze and Make it Wit Chu from Era Vulgaris to start off."
qotsa,2m5nca,Hally_,3,Thu Nov 13 20:20:53 2014 UTC,"It really depends on what you like:  Self-titled album: Gritty, unpolished sound, driving guitar. Stand-outs include ""Regular Jon,"" ""How to Handle a Rope,"" ""Mexicola+Hispanic Impressions"" ""You Can't Quit Me, Baby"" (although that one might be an acquired taste, I used to skip it) and the bonus track, ""The Bronze."" Underrated album, in my opinion.  Songs For The Deaf: Loud. Heavy guitar, loud vocals, some screaming, darker undertones throughout. Concept album of the drive from LA to Joshua Tree. Considered their best by many fans. Stay tuned after ""A Song For The Deaf"" for bonus acoustic, ""Mosquito Song.""  Lullabies to Paralyze: Thematically darker, but musically lighter. No screaming, but expect some more heavy, driving guitars. ""The Blood Is Love"" and ""Someone's In The Wolf"" are two of their best songs, in my opinion. Might be my favorite album, but I can never decide.  Era Vulgaris: A bit of an odd duck. With the excpetion of, ""Run, Pig, Run,"" this album is significantly lighter than the previous albums. Criticizes decadence and excess. Expect some fairly odd tuning and timing. A good, but not great album in my opinion.  Rated R: A fairly divisive album among the fanbase. Generally lighter, but Nick Oliveri's screaming is back on ""Tension Head,"" and ""Quick and to the Pointless."" Contains some songs that just don't feel very ""QotSA"" to me. However, I love the B-sides ""You're So Vague"" and ""Born to Hula.""  ...Like Clockwork: The shiny new one. You've already listened to this one, so I don't know why I'm still here. This is their cleanest sound by far, and is vaguely a concept album. Fantastic and emotional ups and downs. It's encouraging to see the band trying a new sound and making good use of it. One of their best, in my opinion, even if (or perhaps because) it is sort of a departure from their usual."

It goes:  Self Titled  Rated R  Songs For The Deaf  (Nick Oliveri gets fired)  Lullabies To Paralyse   Era Vulgaris  Like Clockwork (Nick Oliveri provides backing vocals on If I Had A Tail)"
qotsa,2m5nca,Hally_,1 point,Sat Nov 15 11:51:00 2014 UTC,I believe the release order and dates are:   Queens of the Stone Age - 1998 Rated R - 2000 Songs for the Deaf - 2002 Lullabies to Paralyze - 2005 Era Vulgaris - 2007 Like Clockwork - 2013

qotsa,2m5nca,zingo-spleen,2,Thu Nov 13 22:04:16 2014 UTC,"Make sure you listen to the albums at least a couple of times to soak it in. ...Like Clockwork's one of my favourites, it just got better every time I heard it. (Rated R's my fav album though, maybe listen to that after SFTD)"
qotsa,2m5nca,TkMill1,2,Fri Nov 14 02:30:56 2014 UTC,"Agreed. ...Like Clockwork takes a bit of getting used to. I Sat By The Ocean, Smooth Sailing, and My God Is The Sun are a great way to start getting into any band. Also, LISTEN TO IT IN ORDER! It will be weird, but it is in that order for a reason. If I Had A Tail, My God Is The Sun, and Kalopsia all flow into one another and make for a wonderful little medley in the middle of a great album."

qotsa,2m5nca,vincientjames,1 point,Thu Nov 13 21:59:19 2014 UTC,"Start with Songs for the Deaf. It's an album unlike any other rock album out there and it's what got me hooked.   If you want a more stoner rock sound after that, listen to Rated R, and if you want a more alt rock sound, try Era Vulgaris, but just because I'm not mentioning the other albums doesn't mean they aren't as great as those first three. Every album is amazing.  O, and a lot of their albums are jam packed with musical guests too. If you check those people out you will discover so many other great artists."

qotsa,2m5nca,vgman20,1 point,Thu Nov 13 15:59:52 2014 UTC,"I find one of the best ways to get into a band is with live performances or albums. They generally give you a wider scope of the bands musical styles and then obviously what they're capable of live. I don't know that I would listen to a band that can't put on a good live show (hint: Queens is not one of those bands).   That being said there's the live CD/DVD called Over The Years and Through the Woods that's fantastic. It's lacking the newest two albums but it's still recommend it as a good place to start. From there you can just look up which studio albums have your favorite tracks off the live one and work your way through the catalog that way.  There's also tons of free, really high quality full live sets on YouTube like the iTunes festival or coachella 2013."
qotsa,2m5nca,anotherale,1 point,Thu Nov 13 17:49:52 2014 UTC,"Do it chronologically, and make sure you listen to the albums all the way through before you move on. That's the way I did it. The band changes so much from album to album, it's surprising that they can sound so good while trying out different things."

qotsa,2m5nca,RobBanana,1 point,Fri Nov 14 06:27:51 2014 UTC,"Really tough one. What an awesome feeling to just be getting into a band like this right now. You have a lot of amazing music ahead of you. As others have said, opinions will vary. I can only recommend the first album I heard because it worked out so well for me (and since it's the only way I know into their music):   Songs for the deaf: This way my intro into the band. This album came out and instantly became one of my all-time favorites. A true, complete cover-to-cover album. All the songs, despite being so different, string along perfectly into one cohesive album.   Since then, QOTSA have become one of my favorite bands. Now knowing the rest of their albums front to back, here's the order i'd say.    Self-titled Lullabies to Paralyze Like Clockwork... 5.Rated R Era Vulgaris"
qotsa,2m4agq,Stojanikus,14,Wed Nov 12 22:28:26 2014 UTC,The Stooges

qotsa,2m4agq,leftyboy87,7,Thu Nov 13 16:23:37 2014 UTC,"Iggy and the Stooges were a massive influence on the Queens sound.        Josh: ""I heard Lust for Life, and it actually made me quit Kyuss. I listened to it obsessively for two and a half years, and at the end I thought, 'There are just way too many bands out there, and if you want to know what I have to say, just listen to this record. It's all here.' I sort of went backward with Iggy Pop, and eventually I got to the Stooges' Raw Power, which I still think is the craziest-sounding record ever. Take any band that says they're raw, play them Raw Power, and they'll sound like the biggest pussies of all time."""
qotsa,2m4agq,adrian1897,2,Thu Nov 13 17:34:39 2014 UTC,whoa.

Place held about 100 people.  We all got wasted and after the show Nick O and Josh H were just sorta hanging around.  They weren't superstars, so we bought them beers and me and my friend Adam and I played Nick and Josh Fussball for a few hours.    No photos,  no fan shit,  just game faces,  shit talking,  draft beer and Rophynol.   Afterwards I offered a pill to Nick and he asked what it was.  I told him it was a Rophynol.  He hesitated and said 'a what?'   I repeated,  it's a Rophynol.   He said,  'what?'   I said,  it's the date-rape drug dude.  And he went 'Oh'  and popped it down.   They were both decent Fussball players,  or maybe not.  either way Nick screwed one of the girls we were with and I passed out under their  tour bus.  I can remember Josh shaking his head at me before they split.   We got Steak and Shake on the way home."

All the first three CDs are heavily bootlegged and 95% of the time, the cheap ones are boots (though they're still £10+).

I kinda get the 'not going anywhere' comments, but I mean, who cares? It is one the sexiest songs in existence and I like to believe they do not play it live because it'll start a goddamn orgy in the crowd.

BOURDAIN"" : a few months back, I was working in PR in NYC and I represented a company called City Harvest.  We ran a Red Carpet style event at a place called Ciprianis with some of the most well known Chefs around the world -- and I had the pleasure of making sure each Chef awaited his turn and got thru the spinning glass door.  Well, I was unaware that Mr. Anthony Bourdain would be coming... but when I turned around and saw him, I freaked, which is sorta not good in PR but w.e..... so the first thing I asked him about was NJ (Im from there) and then Josh Homme/QoTSA (Asked him what it was like hanging w Josh during his No Reservations show w Queens).  He said that Josh is a madman and ""he loves bar fights.  Cherishes them actually..."", and that partaking in a bar fight with Josh Homme on his side was ""one of the highlights of his life.""  I shit you not he told me this... with the biggest shit-eating grin on his face.  Little did he know it was a highlight of my life hearing that.

The last chunk of Lullabies suffers from this as a whole (The Blood is Love, Skin, Killer Scene, Long Slow Goodbye) with the one exception of Broken Box which kind of calls back to the sequence of singles that makes up the first half of the album (especially with the ""in my head"" lyric, haha). So you've got all of these kindof downtempo, minimal drive, minimal variation songs and I think it's hard to separate Skin from it's main identity as part of a very underwhelming end to Lullabies.  To look at it specifically: the groove is definitely cool for a while but as previously said doesn't really go anywhere. Falsetto with distortion on it is almost unpleasant at times. I'd hope this is what Josh was going for; if any Lullabies song could've gone on Era it's this one. Definitely a song intended to hurt a little bit. Interestingly, Skin is one of the least performed LP Queens songs of all time, behind only Lightning Song (0 live shows) and tied with Droids (both with 3)"
qotsa,2lreei,dankyflam,3,Sun Nov 9 16:56:10 2014 UTC,"Really gotta disagree with you on that, not counting Blood Is Love and Broken Box I fucking love everything on LtP from Someone's In The Wolf to the end. I don't know how ending with Killer Scene and Long Slow Goodbye could be underwhelming; I don't think a song's weak just cause the riff doesn't change up a lot, hell I Think I Lost My Headache is my favorite song by them.  And, I could be wrong, but I don't think Spiders and Vinegaroons hasn't been played  live either."
qotsa,2lreei,xbxvx97,2,Sun Nov 9 20:31:38 2014 UTC,"Not meaning to discredit any of those songs, I guess I mean that the pacing of the album throws me off from switching to such a chill finale- sometimes too much of one good thing can become tiring. I totally agree that a song is not weak by not changing up- it just becomes an issue if the song isn't particularly strong to begin with. Some of those late record tunes stacked up just become a bit too low key  imo.   Spiders is played live as an excerpt inside of Fun Machine and is also used as an intro sometimes. So it has some presence at live shows but technically not, you're totally right."
qotsa,2lreei,xbxvx97,4,Mon Nov 10 01:23:12 2014 UTC,"I really don't like this song, its just trying too hard and it doesn't sound any good.  The riff comes out strong but gets pretty repetitive quickly. It's a dirty riff that looks like its going somewhere but then the vocals just absolutely destroy the groove. This is the one song that Josh's falsetto just doesn't work and feels super forced. Not to mention the over-sexualized lyrics in this song just doesn't even come close to some of the lyrical work Josh puts in other songs. I'd expected these lyrics to come from a RHCP song(old era), at least they know how to make it funky and dance-able. I'd imagine Josh made this song when he was really fucking drunk; the entire thing is so fucking cringe worthy ehhhhh."
qotsa,2lreei,skyraiderofreddit,3,Sun Nov 9 15:35:47 2014 UTC,"Homme's falsetto at the end (""I wanna lick you too much"") is probably up there with the ending to Long Slow Goodbye , kinda curious why you don't like it."
qotsa,2lreei,xbxvx97,3,Sun Nov 9 20:35:01 2014 UTC,"To me, it sounds scratchy and out of tone his singing in that last part. My body just gets the ""nails on the chalkboard"" sensation.  Maybe if I was on acid while fucking would this song be great, but right now I just can't dig it."

Showed it to a buddy and he opened my eyes that it's actually a pretty cool variation (and I can find a million other live versions without it)  Just thought I'd share it

qotsa,2lc9p8,adrian1897,2,Wed Nov 5 18:10:33 2014 UTC,Are you sure it wasn't Brendon McNichol? He often played the 'In My Time of Dying' riff on lap steel.

The part in question is at the end of Quick and to the Pointless. I should point out that it did turn out to be just a quick riff from Page's In my Time of Dying...Sorry to get anybodies hopes up."

qotsa,2l7307,TheRealBBOX,1 point,Tue Nov 4 23:04:19 2014 UTC,"Apologies for the delay. The punch receiver started off with your typical drunk rowdiness, but it amped up quite a bit throughout the night. The guy who ended up punching him was very clear early on about telling the dude he was being obnoxious without escalating, and instead of backing down the guy went into full macho mode, saying stuff like ""I'm from Louisiana, that's just how I party. If you have a problem, come at me.""   Basically, he kept daring cooler heads to do something about it, and continued being a dick by pushing people and being a jackass, to the point where there was a decent sized group of people around him that were sick of his shit. At one point, the girl this guy was with left him in tears, only to eventually end up back at his side.  I didn't see the dude again for a while and mostly forgot about him, and the gentleman who had kept his cool all night went back to enjoying the evening with the woman he was with. The asshole came back and starting flinging himself through the crowd, pushing everyone including the gentleman and the woman, at which point the gentleman grabbed the asshole by the shoulder to turn him around and starting whaling on his face.  They both fought for a bit (this was right as Nick was coming out) until security broke it up. Initially security just pulled the nicer guy out, but everyone in the area started yelling and pointing at the asshole guy, indicating he was the one causing problems. Security pulled him out too.  The gentleman came back through the front with security to look for the woman he was with, and it seemed like they found each other, but once Nick took the stage, it was pretty hard to tell what was going on.  The asshole guy was a problem to everyone around him, only most people didn't do anything about it. I know I wasn't the only one with a big grin on my face when he started getting punched."

Sounds like he was pretty much asking for it."

qotsa,2l7fry,notactuallyjoshhomme,18,Mon Nov 3 23:23:38 2014 UTC,"Vultures. Easy. No one can destroy on drums like Dave when he's in the zone, and that is evident on Elephants and New Fang especially, and Josh brings in his fabulousness in his falsetto on Scumbag Blues No One Loves Me and Neither do I and his dark, brooding side for Spinning in Daffodils. The real star, in my opinion, is John. Highway 1 and Reptiles throw some weird shit into his bass playing and they are perfect. He also showcases his multi-instrumental talent on Scumbag Blues and Caligulove. The real jewels are when they all work together for that perfect, fucked-up balance that we all know and love, namely the second half of No One Loves Me, Mind Eraser, and Warsaw. TL; DR: Them Crooked Vultures without a question."

qotsa,2l7fry,charley-zard,4,Thu Nov 6 01:12:59 2014 UTC,"Personally, I've recently completed the Desert Sessions collection and although they are a tad patchy they're also very rewarding listens.  Kyuss are obviously superb, and Them Crooked Vultures' one album is every bit as good as Era Vulgaris era QOTSA.  I've never been especially into EODM, though, I find them to be quite shallow and too samey sounding, though they are fun in small (4 or 5 song) listens.  If I had to chose my one favorite, it would have to be Kyuss, simply for the fact that unlike TCV they released three masterpieces, not one."
qotsa,2l7fry,Sephtical,4,Mon Nov 3 23:24:50 2014 UTC,"I think Eagles of Death Metal is actually my favorite. TCV is obviously a powerhouse of talent in every aspect, but I just really love the ""kitschy-ness"" of EODM. I also just really love Jesse Hughes, he seems like he'd be a riot to hang out with. The way he and Josh give each other shit is hilarious."

qotsa,2l3qt7,TSalomez,8,Tue Nov 4 03:59:18 2014 UTC,"His voice has definitly improved especially in comparison to the Lullabies era. If you see some of the footage from that time you can tell that he had trouble maintaining high notes and went off key during a number of performances. My guess is that he smokes a lot less than he  used too, does a lot less other stuff as well and has been taking lessons from a voice coach. His range hasn't changed that much but his breathing has improved significantly which has given his voice a lot more power."
qotsa,2l3qt7,real_nice_guy,2,Mon Nov 3 07:34:21 2014 UTC,I wager you are correct.
qotsa,2l3qt7,sgrwck,2,Mon Nov 3 08:14:57 2014 UTC,My guess is that he smokes a lot less than he used too   absolutely. I think that his accident probably made him examine his vices and how they may have been effecting his abilities.
qotsa,2l3qt7,PoorGuyThatManJohnT,1 point,Mon Nov 3 15:13:50 2014 UTC,I saw them twice this past year and both times he smoked throughout the show and one of them he polished off a bottle of tequila. I bet he has a voice coach and the same vices.

qotsa,2l29p3,PoorGuyThatManJohnT,8,Sun Nov 2 13:43:19 2014 UTC,"I think the hate is cause it starts out pretty cool and then just repeats itself a whole bunch of times. I feel like it should develop a little more, but instead it just feels half-finished. And then it's smacked between two really good songs, so it feels like the low point on the album."
qotsa,2l29p3,looweezy,3,Sun Nov 2 15:09:15 2014 UTC,"I agree 100%. It's a good song for sure, but the songs it's sandwiched between are just better."

qotsa,2l29p3,Gamerhcp,5,Sun Nov 2 13:48:09 2014 UTC,It's QOTSA doing mid-late 60's garage rock song.  I love it - it's something different for the band and I think the haters should try to have a more open mind.  If you take it for what it is it's a great song.
qotsa,2l29p3,tyhad1,5,Sun Nov 2 18:38:34 2014 UTC,I like it. It's quirky to me.
qotsa,2l29p3,andintroducingzylex,4,Sun Nov 2 14:05:48 2014 UTC,"I think the fact that it's sandwiched between two monstrously awesome makes me appreciate it more. It's an excellent cool down song that makes Song For The Deaf seem even bigger than it already is. As a standalone song it's not really remarkable, but it's an absolutely necessary part of the album as a whole."
qotsa,2l29p3,Karrottz,3,Sun Nov 2 19:38:06 2014 UTC,"It's my least favourite QotSA song. The guitars just don't sound right to me, and I don't think Nick's vocals are as great as they are on songs like Tension Head or Gonna Leave You. However, the bridge of the song is definitely the high point, and there's some great drum work on the song. But the chorus just doesn't do it for me; it's not exciting. Probably the worst part about the song is that it's right between God is in the Radio and Song For The Deaf, which are two monstrous, powerful songs. Another Love Song just feels weak and half-assed. Nick's performance at the Halloween show helped me appreciate it a bit more, though."
qotsa,2l29p3,ruinedoverout,3,Sun Nov 2 18:15:40 2014 UTC,"I think it's a great little interlude of sorts between ""God is in the Radio"" and ""A Song for the Deaf"" and serves its purpose in that regard. It's not one of my favorites or anything but it definitely belongs on the album. I'd definitely shave ""Do It Again"" off the track list if I was running things, though."
qotsa,2l29p3,Kaijusaurus,2,Sun Nov 2 23:48:23 2014 UTC,I like this song a lot. I think this is the most underrated Queens song in my opinion.
qotsa,2l29p3,StartAlpine,2,Sun Nov 2 18:15:31 2014 UTC,"I love it! It has a strange, mariachi-on-acid vibe with solid drums and quirky guitar. I think it keeps the pace with the rest of the songs and fits well in the mix. I really like how Songs for the Deaf has epic jams mixed with hamfisted rockers (sorta like scanning through the radio)."

qotsa,2l29p3,headless_bourgeoisie,2,Fri Nov 7 21:24:12 2014 UTC,"It's a decent tune, but it feels a little extraneous on a very lengthy album. If it was up to me I would have saved this, Gonna Leave You, and/or Do It Again for EPs or singles. Not because any of then are bad songs, mind you, just because the album is so long and those songs lack the ""weight"" of the other material."
qotsa,2l3xyr,ruinedoverout,2,Sun Nov 2 23:52:19 2014 UTC,I have also considered a lot of ideas for QOTSA ink.

Because you can find various fonts used by QOTSA on their different albums quite easily on the net.  As far as pictures go, I guess maybe a butchers knife to represent Someone's in the Wolf (there is some official artwork in that vein)? Era Vulgaris would be the easiest though, because of all the characters they created for the art."

The way everyone froze on stage, the juxtaposition of his devil horns amidst the priest outfits, the way he slowly saunters onto the stage while the stagehand in a nun outfit hurriedly tries to sneak past with his mic & stand.  10/10."

qotsa,2kzq3w,Dramaticnoise,2,Sun Nov 2 22:32:01 2014 UTC,I could see Nick in a vocalist type role like Lanegan was in 2002...  But I agree that Mikey should stay on bass.

Queens is one of the lighter bands I listen to.  They are my fav, but I'm slanty to darker and heavier stuff.  Nick would be allowed to write I think, something mikey will never be allowed to do.  Not cuz he's not good enough, it's just a relationship thing between nick and josh I think."

qotsa,2kzfaj,2tidesaday,10,Sat Nov 1 15:54:34 2014 UTC,Couldn't agree more. The line up is the best they've had so far.

qotsa,2kzfaj,rudeboyrasta420,2,Sat Nov 1 17:55:33 2014 UTC,"As a drummer myself, I prefer Joey.  So far, anyway.  To me, Joey seemed more inventive, and still absolutely rock solid.  I mean, Jon is cool too, but I've not heard him do anything yet that I don't think Joey could do, if I'm honest.  I guess the decider will be they start preforming new material / record a new album because he'll then have to make up his own beats instead of playing other peoples.  Also, for the record, there's no way LTP and EV are the worst Queens albums, and even if they were, it would be the quality of the songs that decided that, not the drumming."
qotsa,2kzfaj,kooli0,2,Sun Nov 2 12:23:25 2014 UTC,"Love john because he is so perfect no matter what he has to do.

qotsa,2kzfaj,enough_space,7,Mon Nov 3 19:31:47 2014 UTC,I dunno man I feel like Joey was his own breed. No one donkey konged the drums like he did.
qotsa,2kzfaj,headless_bourgeoisie,5,Sat Nov 1 21:02:54 2014 UTC,"Ehh, I gotta disagree there man. Joey is a punk drummer and Queens isn't a punk band. He consistently sped up tempo live and the two albums he appeared on were the band's weakest imo. Jon is a much more technically skilled drummer (Mars Volta's first three albums say it all) but he can still hit hard as fuck, which is exactly what the band has needed all along."
qotsa,2kzfaj,thewisefoolHHH,7,Sat Nov 1 22:39:07 2014 UTC,Joey is a punk drummer and Queens isn't a punk band.   I think even Josh would disagree with you on that   the two albums he appeared on were the band's weakest imo.   Lullabies might be my favorite. It's certainly not a weak album. But that's beside the point. The drumming on the Joey albums is great. Tons of style and totally locked in to what the guitars are doing. I can sing you drum parts from those albums.  Queens have always had great drummers and Jon is no exception. I look forward to hearing what he does in the studio.
qotsa,2kzfaj,kooli0,2,Sat Nov 1 23:25:12 2014 UTC,"Lullabies is tied with ...Like Clockwork for my favorite, but I agree with you. Joey was great and he definitely fit well in the band, but I'm really excited about Jon. Dude is a monster on the drums."

qotsa,2kzfaj,HeIsntMe,3,Sun Nov 2 01:58:35 2014 UTC,"But in my opinion, that was one thing that mad Joey era Queens so cool.  I'm a huge fan of punk rock, and when Queens had him it gave their live stuff such a punk edge that I dug so much.  He wasn't the best drummer, certainly not for Queens, but I absolutely loved what he added to their sound."

qotsa,2kzfaj,HeIsntMe,-6,Sat Nov 1 21:19:39 2014 UTC,This is why r/qotsa just kills me. There's so many new hipster ass qotsa fans who started with like clockwork. Idgaf about the technical prowess of Volta. Up until clockwork queens was anything but technical. It was about the flow and the power.  Listen to give the mule. All that mattered was that they hit hard. ...Incoming down votes for a lifelong fan's opinion.
qotsa,2kzfaj,kooli0,7,Sun Nov 2 01:57:12 2014 UTC,"Dude, I don't disagree with your opinion at all. However you are wrong in that I've been into the Queens for a lot longer than Like Clockwork. Rated R was the first album and tour I experienced and I've been hooked ever since.  Who John used to be and what he used to play has little impact on what he'll be doing now.  Volta was a different band. Anyone expecting to hear a mashup of the two on the next record is up for a massive disappointment.  My problem with Joey was there well before John.  Every time I saw them with him, I'd cringe. Listen to any live set and tell me he has any sense of tempo or dynamic.  That's not technique, that's being a drummer - keeping a constant tempo and playing with dynamics. Yea, John is a much more fluid player than Joey or even Dave, and that's well and good and I'm looking forward to hearing where they take that. But Joey was always such a basher, always played like he was angry with the songs. Drove me nuts.  Songs like Chemistry or The Fade or even Mule are not just bashing drum parts - they need more than that and Joey, in my opinion just couldn't deliver.  Which is odd because I've heard him in other settings where he wasn't terrible."
qotsa,2kzfaj,burnt0ast,-2,Sun Nov 2 05:01:34 2014 UTC,Fair enough. I just have such a hate on for the new album/style. I'm obv just a butthurt oldfag but man I miss the good ol days.

qotsa,2kyndv,Mr_vindictive,5,Sat Nov 1 10:59:35 2014 UTC,Maybe Josh finds it hard to play Missing?  It feels like the most personal of the songs and deals with his own death. Just a thought.
qotsa,2kyndv,thedudeabides1602,4,Sat Nov 1 13:24:23 2014 UTC,Yeah they played it at the big shows that I saw on Youtube so I figured they would have to play it.  Until next time... I've always had a Queens show on the horizon on this tour and its sad not knowing when they'll be back.  I wasn't huge on Oliveri's set.  Not my favorite songs as the Rated R/SFTD is the most hit or miss era for me.    But he seemed really happy and grateful so it was a nice moment.

qotsa,2kvikj,Askdust,3,Fri Oct 31 12:46:07 2014 UTC,Unfortunately it didn't - I did a lot of searching the Web when I found one for sale myself and I think it's a pretty recent boot.

qotsa,2kvikj,jessamineny,3,Fri Oct 31 13:39:38 2014 UTC,The split EP is a bootleg since it has never been officially released on vinyl. But the bootleg edition is still very cool.

There are apparently 3 songs that were recorded in studio that didn't make it on album, this one, highway 1, and one other I don't know the name of. That information is coming from an interview with Grohl at one of their first concerts.   But from what I hear there are several others that perhaps weren't recorded the same time they did the others. So that interview must have been before they made the original album."

qotsa,2kw1ba,RaptureHitler,1 point,Fri Feb 6 10:39:20 2015 UTC,"Queens of the Stone Age (the reissue). My all-time favourite album. It's so sonically bleak, depressing yet multi-faceted and deep. Every song is so perfectly placed as well. The Bronze is, no joke, the best song of all time. Don't believe me? That solo at around 1:50 is the best bit of music ever written. Lullabies to Paralyze. Every single song is gold. It starts off so dark and twisted (Everybody Knows, Tangled, etc), gets really creepy with the insanely weird combo of I Never Came and Someone's in the Wolf, then launches into their second best ever song, The Blood is Love. Then gets all sexy with Skin and Box, before going groovy then chilled (though tinged with sadness) with Scene and Goodbye. So good. Era Vulgaris. Seen to be their worst by many, I didn't really 'get it' until quite recently, but the things that always put me off - the grimy, industrial feel, the chronic painful guitar riffs - actually work in its favour hugely if you let it drag you into its bizarre world. And Make it Wit Chu is a really nice mid-album sing-along, beautiful and sexy. Rated R. Such a huge variety of styles and feelings here, there's not much to say other than it flows perfectly from start to finish and deserves the high praise it gets. ...Like Clockwork. Sometimes I like it more than I usually do (usually when I'm feeling very down, this album speaks to me), but that's not a put-down at all. This album is obviously hugely different to anything else QotSA and whilst it's fantastically crafted and beautiful, I can't help but feel it's too... I dunno... 'light'? Joey Castillo was my favourite QotSA drummer because of his fucking unrelenting power and the fact that he left during this album says it all. Still though, a great album and the reference to Walkin' on the Sidewalks in Fairweather Friends makes me smile. Songs for the Deaf. Rather weirdly, the only QotSA album I wouldn't give 5/5 to. Every other album has no bad or mediocre song - but on this one I always feel like skipping several. I like the radio segments but it feels overproduced and some of the songs just don't hold my attention like on previous or subsequent albums. Still a good album (3.8/5) as the good songs are REALLY good - Song for the Dead being obviously one of the best songs ever - but the filler-y feel to some of it really puts me off. Why is it their highest regarded work?"

qotsa,2kpao1,illmatic2112,1 point,Wed Oct 29 23:39:04 2014 UTC,"Yep. Watched the whole vid. First I thought yep, sounds familiar. Then I thought what happened? Then I thought yep, Queens again.   It was good, watching them live like that almost makes them seem like ""baby"" queens, like the band's younger brothers; that's a strong compliment, they're good and they live the music, but they sound a bit unpolished and inexperienced."
qotsa,2kpao1,Space_Bat,1 point,Thu Oct 30 04:50:47 2014 UTC,"Yeah, apparently they started around 2006 so they're pretty decent for how young the band is, not sure how long the band members have been doing music for before De Staat, but I've been listening to the albums today and thoroughly enjoying what they've put out."
qotsa,2kpao1,aonehundred,1 point,Thu Oct 30 04:55:37 2014 UTC,Interesting sound. The drummer not actually being able to drum the what's being heard pulls me out a little. Definitely got the middle-later queens sound
qotsa,2kpao1,Funkbass,1 point,Wed Oct 29 22:12:47 2014 UTC,He's clearly messing around for comedic purposes. Ain't too many drums who stand up either. It's just a joke.

qotsa,2kl0el,dumpyduluth,3,Wed Oct 29 14:54:48 2014 UTC,He's probably the most versatile member of the band. I believe he plays more instruments than any other in Queens. It's a shame if some under appreciate him

qotsa,2kk3pf,mw9000,5,Tue Oct 28 11:10:21 2014 UTC,I remember watching the movie Watch with a few friends and after the movie we started talking about the ending and in the credits - this song plays. I spat out my drink when I realised it was Josh - my friends did not get it. :(
qotsa,2kk3pf,odaal,3,Tue Oct 28 13:01:57 2014 UTC,Same here. Perfect song to end that movie. Homme really captures the scummy charm of LA so well.  Edit: pronoun. You might not be a man.

qotsa,2keqty,adrian1897,8,Sun Oct 26 22:40:45 2014 UTC,It's from the rehearsals for the Natasha benefit show in 2008. It's Joey and Matt Cameron on drums. Dean playing his usual collection of about 30 keyboards. Alain playing a something. Josh behind the mic. Mikey on bass. Chris Goss with the acoustic.
qotsa,2keqty,benduder,2,Mon Oct 27 11:43:02 2014 UTC,When was this taken? Looks like 2004 Alain but 2013 Josh...
qotsa,2keqty,Funkbass,2,Sun Oct 26 23:26:46 2014 UTC,"total guess, but from the rest of the picture it looks like a shot from the Like Clockwork sessions."
qotsa,2keqty,benduder,2,Sun Oct 26 23:53:48 2014 UTC,"Just TinEyed it and this seems to be the earliest source. It sounds like it was taken when they recorded EV, which would make sense re. Alain's hair.  Besides Alain and Josh who else is in that picture? Chris Goss in the back? I thought it might be Dean at the front but he wasn't around for EV..."

qotsa,2keqty,BinaryChode,3,Mon Oct 27 03:16:07 2014 UTC,"It was pearl jam 20, they had a number of festival type shows and josh went up a couple times and did songs with them maybe matt did a song with queens and this is the rehearsal? Just taking a stab at it"
qotsa,2keqty,benduder,3,Mon Oct 27 05:15:13 2014 UTC,Maybe you're thinking of the Natasha Shneider benefit? At one point Matt Cameron got on a second drum kit next to Joey and they did Making a Cross

qotsa,2kd2n9,Gamerhcp,5,Sun Oct 26 12:45:36 2014 UTC,Josh said this song was influential in future song writing because it was the start of them tearing apart pop songs and giving the genre their own weird twists. He said when they write songs sometimes they think 'Oh this is a leg of lamb'.
qotsa,2kd2n9,theojhair,3,Tue Oct 28 18:36:56 2014 UTC,This song always sounds like it is ready to fall apart or should not be together in the first place. Love the hell out of it.

qotsa,2kd2n9,adrian1897,2,Sun Oct 26 17:44:27 2014 UTC,"Well it's a few notes actually. It's still one of my favorites because of the way it fits in. I don't know- there's just something about it. By ""best"" I don't mean most impressive, nor most complicated."
qotsa,2kd2n9,Funkbass,3,Sun Oct 26 17:47:37 2014 UTC,"When they play it at acoustic shows Troy normally says ""one note"" at the start of the solo. It's one fret on one string but there are a few bends thrown in so it's not literally just one note."

qotsa,2kb5eu,rapemybones,2,Mon Oct 27 04:32:18 2014 UTC,"Realistically who we will be seeing will be all of QOTSA, Brody Dalle, Alain, Trent Reznor, Alex Turner, and James Lavelle definitely. Maybe we could see Nick, Jesse, Dave Grohl, Chris Goss and Mark Lanegan and also maybe other Arctic Monkey members. maybe.  Unrealistically would be a small Kyuss reunion (which would be fanfriggintasic) including Fredo, Scott Reeder and Brant Bjork.  Also someone mentioned Dan Auerbach (which would be a dream)."

qotsa,2k1cxf,sarGasm37Bro,4,Thu Oct 23 14:04:39 2014 UTC,Grohl?
qotsa,2k1cxf,The_Churtle,13,Thu Oct 23 05:56:41 2014 UTC,"I thought that but with the new Foo album coming out, his stuff is just getting too gimmicky for me. It seems like he's reading a ""Here's how to 'Rock and or Roll'"" instruction booklet. Where as Homme and White just don't give a crap. Grohl just doesn't give me that ""bad boy"" vibe. Though I totally respect Grohl and glad he is a role model for younger musicians compared to what other kids are looking upto these days."
qotsa,2k1cxf,sarGasm37Bro,8,Thu Oct 23 06:42:30 2014 UTC,"Grohl is an icon for sure, but his music is a bit lukewarm and hasn't really been very experimental in years. Good, but not super exciting."
qotsa,2k1cxf,paddypatronus,7,Thu Oct 23 06:59:14 2014 UTC,"Agreed. I heard someone describe Foo Fighters, as of late, ""Diet Rock"". But like I said, I still respect what he does compared to most."
qotsa,2k1cxf,sarGasm37Bro,3,Thu Oct 23 08:32:35 2014 UTC,"Diet Rock is right. On his new show he talks all about his Punk roots then follows that with his version of predictable radio rock. I like Dave alot as a person and love his filmmaking exploits thusfar but I am really sick of his annointed status as 'THE' accepted mainstream representative of modern rock music.  People say Rock is dead because all they are exposed to is Foo Fighters and the like, it's their own fault but still annoying."
qotsa,2k1cxf,Sephtical,3,Thu Oct 23 09:26:20 2014 UTC,"I think when he won the grammy for Wasting Light he said ""We recorded this album in my garage with tape. We wanna stay true to ""Rock""."" I saw that documentary, his garage is the size of my neighborhood and has the money to record on that expensive tape...that was rigged big time with Protools. Now when Grohl says ""tape"" and ""garage"" people eat that idea up and to the point where I think it's gimmicky. Don't piss on my boots and tell me it's raining. That's why I love Tom Waits, he'll record in a dumpster with a Mr. Mike recorder and it'll sound awesome."
qotsa,2k1cxf,sarGasm37Bro,3,Fri Oct 24 18:26:06 2014 UTC,"Very well put. Grohl is safe. He is still a huge part in keeping rock music alive, but he has a formula that he sticks to. I think his quote in this article about how Homme pushes his drumming skills and style is a testament to both that and Homme's ability to influence others and shape them to fit his plan."
qotsa,2k1cxf,sgrwck,2,Sat Oct 25 06:13:32 2014 UTC,"I just heard Foo Fighters' new single tonight, and kinda disliked it the whole song through for some reason. Even before it started, the radio DJ said the song was ""inspired by Chicago"" (I joked to my boyfriend, ""Chicago the city, or Chicago the band?""), which seemed like a silly idea. The lyrics (""you're my muse"") were clumsy and too much like their other lyrics from the past two decades. Maaaybe because it's their first release since I found out that at least two of the band's members are tinfoil hat-wearing about AIDS or autism.  Funkiest and grooviest Fighters song I've ever heard, with a little metal thrown in, though."
qotsa,2k1cxf,coldvault,1 point,Thu Oct 23 16:01:48 2014 UTC,"The song was kinda boring, and surprisingly messy! My friend is a huge Foo fan, he told me the Chicago thing and my thought was ""Who cares about Chicago?"". Now, I love the windy city. I'm from New York but if the song was about New York I'd still think ""Who cares?"". Then I heard he recorded each song in each city, with a different artist. And filmed it, for HBO. After the success of his Soundcity doc. Which had a soundtrack, with a different artist. He should just be calling his music ""Dave Grohl"", then I wouldn't care. None of it's really Foo Fighters anymore. He's found a formula knowing he's the ""last rock band"" and it rubs me the wrong way now by having Joan Jett on every song."
qotsa,2k1cxf,sarGasm37Bro,2,Thu Oct 23 09:53:53 2014 UTC,"Episode 1 was on hbo last week, it was from Chicago and if you watched it than the song makes sense. He interviews legendary music figures from there like Rick Nielson and Buddy guy and the lyrics are stuff from the episode's interviews. Like Buddy guy talked about being an kid in the cotton fields using a string and a button to make sounds, and there's a line in the song about buttons. They also recorded it at steve Albinis studio and there's an interesting interview with him. I'm not foo fighters fan but it was interesting, there is a episode at Ranco and Josh is in it, not sure when it airs."
qotsa,2k1cxf,BinaryChode,1 point,Thu Oct 23 19:33:10 2014 UTC,Def gonna watch the one with Homme. It all looks very interesting and it's cool Grohl is doing it but I just don't see what it has to do with Foo Fighters.

qotsa,2joqor,PoorGuyThatManJohnT,13,Sun Oct 19 12:34:24 2014 UTC,"Story time. This was the song that made qotsa my favourite band.   I had heard lost art once or twice and thought it was cool but back then I was still more of a foo's/blink/greenday type of a guy.    It was 2002 no one knows was pretty big but I didn't really like it. The comedy video put me off. Go with the flow had started to peek my interest and I would usually listen to it if it came on mtv2.  After a night of gaming and movies at a friends house I was feeling groggy in the morning (this is way before alcohol was involved) I stumbled downstairs to see my friend watching mtv2. We wasn't really paying attention but highlights of the reading/Leeds festival were on tv.   Qotsa came on and played regular john. With the ridiculous breakdown that lasts like 5 minutes. I was probably about 14 at the time. I hadn't heard anything like it. The next day I went and bought the first 2 albums. Sftd was sold out so I came back next week and bought that too.   Even though regular john isn't my favourite song it will always have significance to me because it helped me to find my favourite band. That's why its my username on basically everything.   I've seen qotsa a hand full of times live, met josh got signed posters framed on my wall. Planning my tattoo and met some great people due to mutual love for queens.   So thanks to that self indulgent but amazing live version for shaping my musical life."

qotsa,2joqor,sgrwck,3,Sun Oct 19 17:35:49 2014 UTC,One of my top 5 Qotsa songs. I love the lyrics and I love the riff. The drums are so great too.   I think this song is about wanting to get laid and prostitutes. The phone number part reminds me of those dirty bathrooms with writing in the stalls.

qotsa,2jn1al,hircismus,2,Sat Oct 18 22:50:37 2014 UTC,Not exactly. It's an artistic trope called danse macabre.
qotsa,2jn1al,SlackingAlready,5,Sun Oct 19 02:04:25 2014 UTC,"I don't think so, danse macabre commonly used skeletons as the instrument of death, which is a vampire here to symbolize more of a draining, leeching type of death instead of an instant one.   Furthermore, the settings of danse macabre were more of landscapes of death than portraits. I think you meant the submotif Death and the Maiden instead of danse macabre. That way, yes, it's very much a possibility The Kiss was based on."
qotsa,2jn1al,SlackingAlready,3,Sun Oct 19 05:31:28 2014 UTC,"You are correct, Death and the Maiden is in the article"

""Death and the Maiden"" and other allusions of article  Danse Macabre:       The motif Death and the Maiden, is related to, and may have been derived from, the Danse Macabre. It has received numerous treatments in various media—most prominently Schubert's quartet of that name. Further developments of the Danse Macabre motif include Death and the King's Horseman, Death and the Senator, Death and the Compass, and Death and the Physician.

The Danse Macabre consists of the dead or personified Death summoning representatives from all walks of life to dance along to the grave, typically with a pope, emperor, king, child, and labourer. They were produced to remind people of the fragility of their lives and how vain were the glories of earthly life.  Its origins are postulated from illustrated sermon texts; the earliest recorded visual scheme was a now lost mural in the Saints Innocents Cemetery in Paris dating from 1424–25.

Each to their own I guess, maybe you have actually heard songs/artists like them before and that's why you get that feeling whilst these are the first that I know of to sound like what they do, if that makes any sense"
qotsa,2jlhiv,BinaryChode,1 point,Sat Oct 18 17:28:31 2014 UTC,"Oh yeah, I can appreciate that they're above average, I think the problem might be that it's just bass and drums!"
qotsa,2jlhiv,thewisefoolHHH,2,Sat Oct 18 21:33:00 2014 UTC,It would be nice to see them incorporate some other instruments further down the line but I think the drum and bass exclusivity is part of their identity

qotsa,2je3fs,BinaryChode,1 point,Thu Oct 16 17:04:40 2014 UTC,Josh said he only put 10 songs on the album so they could play the whole album in concert faster so that might be why a lot of songs got cut

qotsa,2j56so,sexdrugsncarltoncole,3,Mon Oct 13 19:49:03 2014 UTC,Yeah man Go With The Flow is the only one there that wasn't in my top 10
qotsa,2j56so,Taydolf_Switler22,2,Mon Oct 13 21:07:08 2014 UTC,I think it's because it's one of the very few sincere love songs Josh has written.

qotsa,2j56so,bloodjacuzzzi,4,Mon Oct 13 20:44:28 2014 UTC,Misfit Lobe is one of my favs too

qotsa,2j56so,CeleryDistraction,3,Mon Oct 13 23:53:50 2014 UTC,Is there a different survey system we could use to do the next poll?  I've voted all the album surveys but missed this one because I only check this subreddit every second day or so. It's not a big deal or anything but it would be nice to get as many votes in as possible and we capped this one out in a single day.
qotsa,2j56so,CeleryDistraction,3,Tue Oct 14 01:43:03 2014 UTC,"I had no idea the 100 vote cap was a thing, if I knew I would've used something else. After this it shouldn't be a problem, cause I can't see anything else getting that many replies."
qotsa,2j56so,rabbithole,2,Tue Oct 14 01:50:48 2014 UTC,Oh yeah don't sweat it man it's not a big deal at all I was just curious if there was a solution.  If we did a album ranking vote or for the top 10 I think we would hit the cap if it happened for the top 20. I'm not sure cause I have no idea how many have been voting in general.  Thanks for running these by the way I've been enjoy them quite a bit!

All the parts are really distinct from one another and its awesome how they wove them all together.  There's a few times where it seems like the song should end and even when it does end they have a sick as outro."
qotsa,2j0z4d,2tidesaday,12,Sun Oct 12 15:43:55 2014 UTC,"Replaced ""If Only"" as my fave QOTSA song. Also I can sing it to my corgi because we both don't have tails."
qotsa,2j0z4d,DuckfatPopcorn,7,Sun Oct 12 20:39:13 2014 UTC,Alex Turner's little melody at the end and the subsequent fade into whispers is my favorite part.

qotsa,2j0z4d,Jet20,4,Sun Oct 12 20:57:15 2014 UTC,"Probably the most sinister sounding QOTSA song not to appear on Lullabies. The verses are a little stale at the beginning, but once the chorus comes in and the full weight of the song makes an appearance, it becomes one of my favorite tracks off of ...Like Clockwork"
qotsa,2j0z4d,99SoulsUp,3,Mon Oct 13 01:33:03 2014 UTC,"Does anyone have the link to that interview (a few years before LC) where he talks a bit about his tail (which may or may not have been a small strap of leather he hung off his belt, I'm not sure if I'm making this up). It was interesting watching it and seeing how it related to this song."
qotsa,2j0z4d,69ingSpunkingMonkeys,4,Mon Oct 13 06:04:45 2014 UTC,Dean has an awesome synth sound on this.  I thought it was the bass or guitar with some cool effect at first.
qotsa,2j0z4d,Snidernomore,6,Mon Oct 13 06:45:47 2014 UTC,"I'm not going to lie, this is probably my least favourite track on LC. I only just about like it but when I listen to it, it feels very repetitive and basic and I feel the chorus isn't that punchy."

qotsa,2j0z4d,Jasonberg,4,Mon Oct 13 13:35:05 2014 UTC,"This was the first song that grabbed me off of LC. I reckon if one of their best songs that has a popish vibe to it. I love how the song just seems to roll along, it just makes you wanna move. The song just feels like it was created for josh homme only, I feel like his specific vocal style just fits the song like a glove.   I hope they continue to play it live cause it's one of those jams that invites a good time. Like I said earlier it just makes you wanna dance."

qotsa,2ir7c7,Karrottz,0,Thu Oct 9 18:57:02 2014 UTC,Came here to suggest them. New album definitely has a QotSA feel to it.
qotsa,2ir7c7,49th,2,Sat Oct 11 23:03:51 2014 UTC,"If you like Tame Impala check out Pond, Mink Mussel Creek, and Melody's Echo Chamber too. They all have a similar sound and share some of the same band members.  Also, Red Fang."

Check Heavyweight by Infected Mushroom, then if you like that, check Project 100 by them and then everything else, they make some interesting music.   Maybe Twelve Foot Ninja too... I'll leave it up to you, they're pretty heavy sometimes, infused with avant garde styles and bits of electronic influence, really fun and I love their music definitely worth checking."

qotsa,2iibvs,notactuallyjoshhomme,7,Tue Oct 7 00:59:34 2014 UTC,"Check out ""Bubblegum"". It's a departure from his usual downtempo/acoustic/grunge-y music in Screaming Trees and previous Lanegan albums, but the slow songs he has on this album are incredible. It also features many QOTSA (current and past) members and others (Duff Mckagan of GnR).  Some songs I recommend:  Methamphetamine Blues  Hit the City  wedding Dress  One Hundred Days"
qotsa,2iibvs,tyhad1,3,Tue Oct 7 13:37:30 2014 UTC,"I suggest you start with his old band, the Screaming Trees. Sweet Oblivion is their most popular album and you can expand from there. Its good old rock.  You should also look into his solo album Bubblegum, it really is the most soothing music I've heard in a while. His vocals really shine(Especially in One Hundred Days).  He is such a great singer, such a soothing voice."

In terms of his solo work, his first 2 albums are great, my favorite by far are field songs and bubblegum though. Songs like Come to Me, Strange Religion, One Hundred Days, Dont Forget Me, Coastline of Lights, etc.   I havent gotten to listen to his new album but blues funeral is awesome. As well, his stuff with Screaming Trees is kick ass. But he also didsome great work with other singers like Twilight Singers, Gutter Twins, or his stuff with IsobelCampbell (sp?)

To me, all of his solo stuff is worthy.  Stay, Whiskey, Scraps at Midnight, Field Songs, I'll Take Care of You.  Josh Homme was the touring guitar tech & occasional rhythm guitarist for the Trees, which is how he met Mark & how he joined QOTSA.  Also his stuff w/ Greg Dulli from Afghan Whigs is worth checking out."

qotsa,2icu8k,PoorGuyThatManJohnT,12,Sun Oct 5 13:49:41 2014 UTC,"Amazing song.  In the acoustic video Josh explains that the song is about looking towards the future and not ""giving a shit about the past"" and I think I can safely say that we've all had a moment where we've said ""Please let tomorrow be better"" as we're about to fall asleep, and I love how this song captures that feeling of desperate hope.  Even the chord progression, moving from low to high compounds that feeling that tomorrow will be better. The haunting sounds from the piano act like echoes through your mind as that quiet voice wonders ""will it get better?"" in a hopeful, yet downtrodden tone.  The lyrics explain that too, from being tangled up in the plaid to trying to tie loose ends and ""bury [the past] away"" yet still, there's a sense that maybe this is all for naught, since he's been looking forward to a better future for so long and nothing has changed he's jaded from hoping and nothing come if it.  Finally the manic sound at the end: I see a person who needs to leave the past behind trying madly to wipe their slate clean, their hands trying with all their might to clear off all that was once tangled as the guitars and piano come to a crescendo, getting louder as they become more frantic with the need for hope, the need for forgetting, the need for a change.   Then quiet. The next day had come as they wake up and try to figure out if all their hope was for not.  Amazing song. I could listen to it for days."
qotsa,2icu8k,Beastafer,9,Sun Oct 5 18:08:11 2014 UTC,"I've been waiting for this.  Suture Up Your Future is without a doubt my favorite QotSA song. I'd even go so far as to call it their most emotional song; maybe behind I Appear Missing. I love everything about it. Its place on the album, the distorted keyboards, the monstrous ending, the lyrics, the live performances...  This song really hits home for me. I didn't have any friends growing up, so I found solace in music. Though that was before I discovered QotSA, this song still reminds me of that time. Josh says something along the lines of ""this song is about looking forward... and not giving a fuck about what's behind you."" And if you listen to the song with that in mind, it really hits hard. The lyrics describe all the terrible things that can happen in one's life. ""All my evil through a needle"", ""I'd sharpened a knife, then used it till bone made it dull"". The imagery used in these lyrics, suturing up one's emotions with a needle... cutting one's skin all the way to the bone... perfectly contrast the pure happiness of the chorus; ""Don't sweat it... thread it, to forget it.""  Era Vulgaris is a distorted, heavy, misunderstood mess. Growling guitars, electronic influences, and lyrics that reflect on society all culminate in this song. Though the world is a shitty place at times, there's always hope knowing things will be better in the future. To me, the ending of the song represents this future; suddenly, the instruments explode with energy, and fade out into that repeated chord that we know so well. The truest emotion can be found in the acoustic performance, where the ending is extended and some truly incredible melodies are found.  I've learned to play this song on the piano; and it sounds beautiful there. The studio version sounds fantastic as well. The echoing guitars in the chorus that almost seem to be singing, the ultra-distorted bassline, every sound in this song, every lyric, harmony, and melody seems perfectly in place.  I can't say enough good things about this song. 11/10. This song is one of the reasons that QotSA is my favorite band. The song is sophisticated and complex, but manages to be subtle at the same time. It's a shame it gets lost in the mess that is Era Vulgaris (not that messiness is a bad thing,) but just like it's lyrical content, this song is a glimmer of peace in an otherwise chaotic, distorted album.  Fuck, I love this song so much."
qotsa,2icu8k,Karrottz,7,Sun Oct 5 20:38:48 2014 UTC,That bassline though.
qotsa,2icu8k,adrian1897,7,Sun Oct 5 19:29:32 2014 UTC,These are the deepest lyrics on EV. Its about changing your life and stuff and there is always time ti change for the better. Also thanks to this song I learned what suture is. Thanks QOTSA.

qotsa,2icu8k,ztiberiusd,3,Sun Oct 5 14:36:00 2014 UTC,"I really like this song because it feels very personal, and it kind of hits home. My interpretation is that the character in the song is dealing with some depression issues, and ends up using drugs to feel better (""All my evil through a needle""). But eventually the person decides that they're tired of living that way, and decides to fix their life instead of masking their pain.   This is one of my favorite QOTSA tracks, and I love how towards the end it becomes completely balls-to-the-wall, while still retaining that personal feeling I mentioned. 9.5/10, because nothing is perfect"

That poll's gonna go on for a week or so, the results are gonna get posted, then the top 5 from that are gonna get they're own separate poll. About a week after that the top 5 are gonna be up.  After that there's just gonna be some random rankings; B-Sides, Covers, TCV, Kyuss, maybe some EoDM, Humbug, and Screaming Trees. Probably gonna make it a monthly thing by then, so it doesn't get stale.  If you've got any ideas, I'm all for it. I got pretty much all off this from /r/kanye, so I'm fine if it changes."

qotsa,2i2fz0,tonermcfly,1 point,Thu Oct 2 06:19:30 2014 UTC,Plain black. It was £50 off of Amazon UK. I've been told it was a promo they released with the release of Like Clockwork or something? Not entirely sure.

Here are some of their most famous tracks, along with some of my favorite more obscure ones:  Elephant  Mind Mischief  Solitude is Bliss  Apocalypse Dreams  Led Zeppelin  Beverly Laurel  Vital Signs  Sorry if this was overkill. I love Tame Impala. It may take a few listens to get used to them, but I think they're easily one of the best bands making music right now. If you like them, listen to their two albums, Innerspeaker and Lonerism. They're very different in style but both equally as good."

qotsa,2hutk1,C909,2,Tue Sep 30 12:04:23 2014 UTC,"Just a couple notes to make here:    Oppenheimer's Brother[1]      Demo version during the Gamma Ray sessions    Rickshaw[2]      This is a Desert Sessions song. I wouldn't characterize it as a QOTSA song, despite the band playing it several times in Europe 10-odd years ago.     18 AD[3]      QOTSA's first official song. Off a stoner rock compilation.     Cathedral City (God is in the Radio Instrumental Demo)[4]      Demo made during the SFTD sessions. This demo, as well as others, are widely available.     Queens Of The Stone Age - Cathedral City(God is in the Radio)[5]     This is actually an alternate version of God/Radio. I thought it was played before the band laid down the actual track in the studio, but I recall seeing various versions live.     100 Days (Mark Lanegan cover)[6]      I wouldn't characterize this as an official QOTSA cover. Josh has played this solo or with another guitarist accompanying him.    Other songs not included in that track listing OP posted but valid should include (off the top of my head):    the Gamma Ray EP Burn the With, I'm Designer, Blood is Love Millionaire etc. remixes Most Exalted Potentate  White Wedding (Billy Idol cover) Droids the various Hula/Infinity versions Paranoid (Sabbath cover) from some Sabbath tribute show. Technically a live track, but the sound quality is pretty decent.  Goin' Out West Outlaw Blues  And so on, and so forth. You get the gist. There's a ton of stuff out there.    Then you can have a bunch of non-QOTSA but Josh related stuff like:    Wellwater Conspiracy, Mastadon, Arctic Monkeys guested tracks That song he did with Florence and the Machine That song he did for the End of Watch soundtrack You could probably put the 100 Days versions here, as well as other stuff he's done in special one-off live, like the 5:15ers and his recent show at the Meltdown Festival in London"
qotsa,2hutk1,itsdgc,1 point,Tue Sep 30 17:32:19 2014 UTC,Queens also recorded Rickshaw. It's slightly different to the DS version.
qotsa,2hutk1,adrian1897,1 point,Tue Sep 30 17:50:34 2014 UTC,"Ah right. That version of Rickshaw is actually called ""Sherbet"", The QOTSA version of Rickshaw was never properly released. Josh once misplaced the tapes or something but a close friend of his leaked it, along with Oppenheimer's Brother. Also, that version Rickshaw or ""Sherbet"" technically predates the QOTSA band, when it was in its Gamma Ray incarnation, I believe."
qotsa,2hutk1,itsdgc,1 point,Tue Sep 30 18:04:06 2014 UTC,"That's a common misconception (based on one incorrectly titled Youtube video I think). Sherbert is a different song, that has never been heard by the public. It was recorded when John McBain was in the band. The Queens and DS versions are both just different versions of Rickshaw."
qotsa,2hutk1,adrian1897,1 point,Tue Sep 30 20:51:45 2014 UTC,"Pretty sure its Sherbet. I can check on my home machine later, but I got it from Blank off the old RR board."
qotsa,2hutk1,itsdgc,1 point,Tue Sep 30 22:00:58 2014 UTC,"It gets wrongly called Sherbert all the time, but John McBain told a guy on youtube called ""desertblitzkrieg"" (who is good friends with Alain Johannes) the following:      ""Sherbert was part of a 6 song demo that I did when I was in QOTSA.

Read, this doesn't mean ""understand why he was kicked out"" or ""think Mikey is a good bassist too.""  Nick being in the band produced a markedly different sound and energy for QOTSA and to actively dislike that is junk. He is the only other member besides Josh who added something besides ""playing their instrument"" to Queens.   This sub slobbers all over Mikey (and Like Clockwork...different rant for that) and actively dislikes Nick. To say that Tension Head is just barely better than Lightning Song... are you serious?

You might want to check out a tribute song I did based on that video.  Ginger Elvis  EDIT: Here's the audio as well.  I made it a tribute because I ripped that riff directly and the rest kind of seemed a little too much like Avon.  I also used a drum beat Josh does in EODM."

Another part of that guitar moves video I loved is how josh said he would omit certain notes from the typical blues scale, or add odd notes instead, and only use those. It adds such a distinct feel - but it's so much easier said than done! Haha"
qotsa,2hk7vp,optismash-prime,1 point,Sat Sep 27 01:07:40 2014 UTC,"Yeah I've busted that scale out a few times.  I was sort of inspired by him for finding an unusual scale not common to Western music.  So I starting figuring out strange scales used in classical music and blending them.  So I would put a basic blues soloing over a classical chord progression and vice versa.  Just recently I had the idea of using two different scales within the same phrase.  So I would start with some creepy wicked sounding scale and then finish off the phrase with a more stereotypical ""cliche"" riff.  I think this may become ""my thing.""  Basically that video really made me think about my own playing and find out what all my tricks are so I can play off of them."

I clicked on it, liked it a lot, and downloaded Little Sister on iTunes but never actually check out any other of their songs. This was maybe 2011. And then ...Like Clockwork came out and I heard the guys on a podcast I listen to raving about it and so I checked it out. It took me a good three full listens to really fall in love with it, but I knew right away that I really dug the sound. After that I had downloaded Era Vulgaris and eventually the same guys from the podcast (Assemble After Dark) did an episode talking about the entire QOTSA discography, so in ""preparation"" I spent a weekend just listening to their entire body of work and really came to appreciate every album for completely different reasons.

My little brother loved it though; he was like 5 years old and got excited whenever it played, jumping around and going ""Da-da- dada, da-da- dada!"" So I would play it for him knowing he loved it. Then in middle school I had my own mp3 player with a random collection of songs, and among them was No One Knows and 3's and 7's.

Maybe it'll be acoustic. I think the current incarnation would make a fantastic acoustic album.  Who knows.

You can usually do a little research to find out, or maybe go to the Discogs page (they catalogue boots as well.) Sound varies, but there are some very good boots out there. Do keep in mind it's technically illegal to buy and sell them, similar to pirating, so check to make sure sellers aren't too sketchy, but you most likely won't get in trouble with the law for bootleg records."

Altough I think it gets overlooked by the other hits in the album and it being one of the longer songs, it's easily forgetful. I mean they can't all be catchy hits right?  Out of all the deep cuts QOTSA has produced, sky is fallen truly deserves to be top 3."

What I mean by that is the riff is really simple, loud and the band just goes balls to the wall with their intensity. Don't get me wrong, I love when Queens go more experimental and dynamic with their songs, but there is something so primal and violent about the Sky is Falling and that makes it a great track."

qotsa,2gwd7p,Thatpirate1911,6,Fri Sep 19 22:54:21 2014 UTC,I always took the various songs on the album as various music styles you hear on the radio. Another Love Song fills the quota for a British Invasion/early 60's Beatles track. Just listen to the drum and the organ. It's why I enjoy the song so much.
qotsa,2gwd7p,OpabiniaGlasses,5,Sat Sep 20 04:49:40 2014 UTC,"That and Gonna Leave always kinda felt like filler to me. Definitely not a bad song, just not as good as the rest of the album."
qotsa,2gwd7p,Sniper_Extreme,2,Fri Sep 19 23:03:29 2014 UTC,Don't like Nick's voice in it. Was an originally catchy riff but it quickly became annoying. The solo is good. Not a fan of the lyrics. And when Nick sings the chorus it just sounds kinda lazy. Feels out of place on the album too. Just reasons why I dislike it.

qotsa,2gip4p,gnice3d,1 point,Tue Sep 16 13:37:33 2014 UTC,Distribution on these are weird... I think they get shopped every few years to a different label. Spotify doesn't really lube up for artists either.
qotsa,2gip4p,matthalius,2,Thu Sep 18 00:49:28 2014 UTC,"When I ripped my Desert Sessions CD on iTunes, it got all the track names from whatever database it usually does and the artist name for ""Shepherd's Pie"" was Dessert Sessions so I think it's done on purpose."

qotsa,2geem5,runt_,3,Sun Sep 14 21:08:13 2014 UTC,I think it's the synth you're talking about?
qotsa,2geem5,JackSheet,2,Mon Sep 15 00:05:35 2014 UTC,I'm curious about this too because when I jam with my friends the song just sounds empty without the bass and the tone he gets.
qotsa,2geem5,hircismus,2,Sun Sep 14 22:29:34 2014 UTC,"The scooped bass notes are coming from a layered bassline. It's a pretty common recording technique to take a part and output/re-record with a into a different bus in the DAW to create a different sound using other effects and/or instruments. I'm pretty sure that layer is the bass + an electric guitar using hammer ons with an envelope filter, distortion, and a spring reverb. The note's specifically would be C# for the first bar, G# into B for the second and third, and C# into E below for the fourth bar."
qotsa,2geem5,Bracket_The_Bass,1 point,Mon Sep 15 05:19:20 2014 UTC,"Pretty sure he's using a semi hollow bass.  On the chorus, I'm pretty sure it's an overdrive or fuzz.   Can't guarantee this though."
qotsa,2geem5,TheParallax,1 point,Mon Sep 15 00:39:22 2014 UTC,He likes to use Way Huge and TC Electronic effects. I think his main fuzz is a Way Huge Swollen Pickle. His clean tone is the result of his Precision bass and an old Fender Bassman set-up. Read more here.
qotsa,2gd2y9,PoorGuyThatManJohnT,11,Sun Sep 14 12:01:45 2014 UTC,I'd say Six Shooter is the worst Nick song. At least Tension Head has the sweet opening riff and bass solo. It fits with the all over the place vibe of Rated R.
qotsa,2gd2y9,leftyboy87,2,Sun Sep 14 14:22:58 2014 UTC,Dude I love both those songs.
qotsa,2gd2y9,headless_bourgeoisie,2,Sun Nov 2 22:36:35 2014 UTC,"Agree, I'll listen to Tension Head if it happens to come on shuffle. SS however to me is flat out unlistenable."
qotsa,2gd2y9,Satanbakesale,2,Sun Sep 14 18:29:31 2014 UTC,"I know I'm probably alone on this, but Six Shooter is one of my favorite QOTSA songs, and the best one on SFTD by a long shot."
qotsa,2gd2y9,ninger6,3,Sun Sep 14 19:05:14 2014 UTC,It's not my favourite but I love listening to it really loud in the car. Good fun.
qotsa,2gd2y9,tctony,9,Mon Sep 15 03:10:11 2014 UTC,"Tension Head, the worst anything? This song is absolutely amazing - from the energy and the lyrics, to the fucking sick riffs. It's only flaw is it being too short. By far my favorite song on Rated R.   Nick doesn't get enough respect in this subreddit. He added something to the band nobody else has; the ability to sing (scream) and write songs, which also allowed Josh to jam out on the guitar more than he can now.   Incidentally, I prefer the Mondo Generator version of it: linkage. And the follow up."
qotsa,2gd2y9,ericplaysbass,9,Sun Sep 14 15:20:37 2014 UTC,"Christ, you lot are so picky.  Lightning Song, filler?  Like fuck it is!  It doesn't need vocals, it's an instrumental.  And a fucking sick one too.  Tension Head kills too, no debating that.  The riff, the vocals... brutal."
qotsa,2gd2y9,caterault,2,Sun Sep 14 17:24:08 2014 UTC,"I enjoy Lightning Song, but in the context of the album, it really does feel like filler. It also just feels too close to That's The Way by Zeppelin for me to really enjoy it as much as you and others do."
qotsa,2gd2y9,Funkbass,3,Sun Sep 14 19:59:31 2014 UTC,I guess I'm in the minority then because as far as I'm concerned it can do no wrong.  I love it every bit as much as the rest of the track on the album.
qotsa,2gd2y9,Jarbas6,5,Sun Sep 14 22:44:18 2014 UTC,"Tension Head is one hell of an intense song. While Quick And To The Pointless is a lot more crazy, Tension Head has a far more angry structure to it. I love how Oliveri's voice matches what he's singing so well (""I strike a match, strike a match, cook it up!"" sounds like he's right on the verge of exploding). The guitars sound vicious throughout, and I love that signature riff the song has. Overall an extremely punchy track, rivaling some of the hardest on SFTD.   Lightening Song is a curious track for sure. I didn't even know Queens had any instrumentals before I heard it, and I love that it's present on Rated R. The guitars here and general melody are pretty enjoyable to let play out, and overall it makes for a very mellow and relaxing break before the long finale to the album.  So yeah, two tracks that I definitely think give Rated R it's identity overall for sure."

I can't see how vocals could be added, it being an acoustic songs after all the madness that happens before it (including Tension Head) really gives the album a nice break before the 8-minute long closer I Think I Lost my Headache. Beautiful melodies in it, too."

qotsa,2g3yxo,jessamineny,3,Thu Sep 11 16:26:30 2014 UTC,That's my guess. Reports from earlier this year said they were going to get to work this fall after the tour. This is too developed to be what they were talking about.

qotsa,2fyjgz,runt_,2,Wed Sep 10 01:19:34 2014 UTC,"While I agree it's not a 100% perfect album, I think it's a pretty solid debut. That being said, the band's inexperience really shows and the QOTSA comparison is more in the instruments on tracks like Little Monster than the vocals."
qotsa,2fyjgz,parrot94,1 point,Wed Sep 10 01:33:18 2014 UTC,I really liked Royal Blood's debut.  Definitely doesn't sound like Queens as much as some people are saying.  Maybe a little on Little Monster.  I mostly think they sound like Muse.

qotsa,2fneey,JohnnyDrama240,9,Sat Sep 6 17:10:32 2014 UTC,Those are some damn sexy vinyls.
qotsa,2fneey,holysideburns,1 point,Sat Sep 6 17:42:22 2014 UTC,The plural of vinyl is vinyl.
qotsa,2fneey,BkcetS,6,Sat Sep 13 02:16:44 2014 UTC,That's damn impressive man! Still working on my QotSA vinyl collection and haven't even thought about DS vinyl yet. Props to you for the dedication!
qotsa,2fneey,Funkbass,4,Sat Sep 6 17:44:49 2014 UTC,"Lemme guess, this costed you over a 100 bucks"
qotsa,2fneey,Gamerhcp,7,Sat Sep 6 18:01:28 2014 UTC,Think like double that or more.
qotsa,2fneey,frankieh,3,Sat Sep 6 18:19:09 2014 UTC,Yeah I'd really like to know what the grand total is there
qotsa,2fneey,DrexlSpivey420,3,Sat Sep 6 18:28:58 2014 UTC,"seeing as most of them are out of print, I'd say around $200"
qotsa,2fneey,Gamerhcp,4,Sat Sep 6 18:32:42 2014 UTC,"Way more, the 10"" early DS vinyl is absurdly expensive."
qotsa,2fneey,leftyboy87,2,Sat Sep 6 20:44:05 2014 UTC,"Even the CD of 5&6 would set you back over 300 on Amazon, new that is. I was really taken aback at how expensive these hardcopies are."

qotsa,2fneey,DrexlSpivey420,3,Sun Sep 7 00:55:39 2014 UTC,I have the Kyuss/Qotsa EP on vinyl and I always see it in my local record store. Maybe they eventually printed it on vinyl? Possibly a bootleg maybe?
qotsa,2fneey,chetmanly411,2,Sun Sep 7 01:40:26 2014 UTC,That one is a bootleg and was never officially released on vinyl. Doesn't mean it's not awesome to have on vinyl though. Just not as collectible as the original CD release.
qotsa,2fneey,KoA07,1 point,Sun Sep 7 13:04:42 2014 UTC,Any way to check if the cd is legit? I picked it up a few days ago.

It's kinda weird because I always think of Rickshaw as being a song Queens performed when they were just starting out, but this was supposedly performed the same year as Rated R was released."

qotsa,2fm809,smokebreak,6,Thu Sep 11 01:04:00 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I think like almost everyone else, I love the studio version but the live extended versions are completely mind-blowing.   There is so much to love about this song, especially the solos, but jesus fuck Mikey's incredible bassline just rides so perfectly underneath the guitars."
qotsa,2fm809,runt_,4,Sat Sep 6 14:14:08 2014 UTC,The live versions solo is the best music to grace my earholes.
qotsa,2fm809,Namrhof,2,Sat Sep 6 11:23:51 2014 UTC,I fucking love TVL's solo in this one. Nice.

qotsa,2fjx0r,Devasaurus,2,Sat Sep 6 01:15:31 2014 UTC,Go spend five minutes in a default sub and try and say that with a straight face.
qotsa,2fjx0r,Pete_Iredale,1 point,Sat Sep 6 09:09:17 2014 UTC,Is the text about mp3s and stuff actually printed on the cover?  Seems kind of weird if so.  I totally love that so many bands will sell you high quality vinyl and include free high quality digit versions.  Best of both worlds!
qotsa,2fjx0r,Pete_Iredale,2,Fri Sep 5 21:13:00 2014 UTC,It's on the shrink wrap

It's actually a pretty clever line, but it just urks me. Still part of one of my favorite DS/QotSA songs though."
qotsa,2fh999,Funkbass,7,Thu Sep 4 19:39:55 2014 UTC,"Yeah this one's mine. I just can't get over it, that said at Reading this year everyone had a smile at this line. Was cute."
qotsa,2fh999,abraxian,4,Thu Sep 4 21:00:49 2014 UTC,"Well, I love those lyrics, I think they're supposed to be sarcastic and are just so funny.   Sometimes the same is different, but mostly it's the same  these mysteries of life, that just ain't my thing  if I told you that I knew about the sun and the moon,  I'd be untrue,"
qotsa,2fh999,Funkbass,6,Thu Sep 4 23:00:50 2014 UTC,"Oh, I certainly think they're meant to be sarcastic. It's still just not quite on a level of ""humor"" that I think makes them very good lyrics, unlike, say ""I'm Designer""'s level of humor."
qotsa,2fh999,Funkbass,3,Thu Sep 4 23:02:32 2014 UTC,"Considering it was written for Desert Sessions, in less than 2 weeks, with multiple other songs, I'll give it a pass. Not to mention, the song as a whole is fuckin sexy."

qotsa,2fh999,ninger6,3,Thu Sep 4 22:42:11 2014 UTC,I agree. Not a big fan of this song's lyrics. Not that they're bad or don't have some meaning behind them... I just don't like 'em.
qotsa,2fh999,hailingburningbones,5,Thu Sep 4 23:02:54 2014 UTC,"I feel the same. I do understand what Josh must have gone through after being brought back from death. And no doubt it was really hard to truly convey those feelings. But ""I feel no love"" just seems so cheesy. ""I Appear Missing"" though.... Holy shit.   That said, Josh is one of my favorite people and musicians of all time. I would have been devastated had they not revived him. But OP asked for my least favorite lyrics, and those came to mind."

qotsa,2fdvie,xbxvx97,4,Wed Sep 3 21:04:44 2014 UTC,I don't think they'll perform Autopilot since that's Nick's song. Kinda like how they don't perform his other songs like Another Love song Gonna Leave you.

qotsa,2fdvie,2tidesaday,4,Thu Sep 4 22:56:00 2014 UTC,"the one time they said ""fuck it"" and played hangin' tree"
qotsa,2fdvie,ericplaysbass,3,Fri Sep 5 20:32:39 2014 UTC,That was the shocker for me.   Hangin' Tree is a gem. No reason not to drop it in more often.
qotsa,2fdvie,asm_wtf,2,Thu Sep 4 05:15:07 2014 UTC,They played in when I saw them in Pittsburgh but that was Sept. 2013
qotsa,2fdvie,DroolingLiver,1 point,Thu Sep 4 05:40:52 2014 UTC,"Same but in Detroit. At first glance I thought 2013 and was like, ""Fuck, I guess I really lucked out!"""

qotsa,2fdvie,likeAdrug,6,Sun Sep 7 06:35:13 2014 UTC,This is a good example for a QotSA setlist.  http://www.setlist.fm/setlist/queens-of-the-stone-age/2014/evenemententerrein-walibi-world-biddinghuizen-netherlands-53ce3b55.html  The mostly start of with Millionaire and No One Knows. And they always play My God Is The Sun and Vampyre of Time and Memory. Of course also a lot of their hits like Little Sister and Burn the Witch always come back. But just search for some setlists from QotSA and watch concerts like these. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xmm0Xah0b7U (There is a guy that posts full QotSA concerts and always puts setlists in the discription).
qotsa,2fdvie,TakemebacktoCali,5,Fri Sep 5 01:35:08 2014 UTC,"Happy I got to see Do It Again!  Having seen them twice now, I'm surprised and disappointed they didn't play 3's & 7's on either occasion.  ...hopefully I'll get to see How To Handle A Rope someday. Still upset I missed their self-titled tour."
qotsa,2fdvie,-euphoriac-,5,Wed Sep 3 19:51:32 2014 UTC,"I got In the Fade when I saw them 2 weeks ago. Thrilled to cross that one off my list!  Leg of Lamb and Like a Drug are 2 more I wanna hear, as well as Auto Pilot - but only Nick can do that... Actually wonder will he play it with them at Halloween ?"

qotsa,2fdvie,AshleySchaefferBMW,3,Thu Sep 4 05:40:53 2014 UTC,"They started playing 3's and 7's again? Damn it, they weren't playing it last summer. I really wanted to hear that one :("
qotsa,2fdvie,MongooseBurger,3,Wed Sep 3 21:00:05 2014 UTC,"Not 2014 but when they played I Never Came last November in Amsterdam I almost fucking melted.   Noteworthy: Smooth Sailing is a fucking sexy song. Given, Josh premised this song as 'a song about sex'. People almost starting humping eachother."
qotsa,2fdvie,Bill-Cosby-Bukowski,3,Wed Sep 3 22:34:29 2014 UTC,Is there really only one song from the self titled album on there?
qotsa,2fdvie,sgrwck,5,Wed Sep 3 22:52:08 2014 UTC,"Yup, I would kill to hear them play How To Handle A Rope live, If Only too."
qotsa,2fdvie,Lockebride,3,Thu Sep 4 00:21:31 2014 UTC,"Yeah, but they recently had a tour where they played the entire S/T. I know everyone loves that album (me too) but I don't blame them one bit for being tired of it."
qotsa,2fdvie,metal_mania420,3,Thu Sep 4 02:43:20 2014 UTC,Saw them twice this tour and they didn't play I Appear Missing once :(  I got Turning on the Screw and First it Giveth though so I won't complain.
qotsa,2fdvie,2tidesaday,2,Thu Sep 4 04:08:35 2014 UTC,"It might be my mind playing a trick on me, but I think they played Keep Yours Eyes Peeled in Toronto. I think I remember that bass reaching taking me by the atoms and giving me continuous eargasms.   EDIT: And they definitely played Better Living Through Chemistry. All my years watching them play that live through youtube, I wanted nothing more than to hear that live my first time around."
qotsa,2fdvie,ebac7,2,Thu Sep 4 10:57:41 2014 UTC,"got to see them for the first time in Frisco back in April. I got to hear Fun Machine, I'm Designer and I Appear Missing"
qotsa,2fdvie,pjdwyer30,2,Thu Sep 4 00:11:43 2014 UTC,Can't believe I Appear Missing isn't played every time.  Saw them twice on this tour and still haven't heard it.  They better fucking play it at the Forum show.
qotsa,2fdvie,adrian1897,1 point,Thu Sep 4 04:34:02 2014 UTC,On Halloween night? It's going to be my first Queens concert!
qotsa,2fdvie,rapemybones,2,Thu Sep 4 16:27:20 2014 UTC,Misfit Love was such a great song to see live.
qotsa,2fdvie,Bill-Cosby-Bukowski,1 point,Sun Sep 7 18:44:03 2014 UTC,I've seen them 3 times on this tour. I've seen nearly every song on that list.
qotsa,2fdvie,tdrunner095,1 point,Thu Sep 4 18:45:11 2014 UTC,"Damn, they played SFTDead at every show on the poll?! I've seen Queens 6 times now since 2002, only seen them play Dead once.   I know 6 isn't a huge amount to go by, and the shows were epic nonetheless, but that's my jam. 2 of the 6 shows were last year (just my luck I didn't get tix this year), but at the 2nd one (in Brooklyn), the last show I've seen them in they finally played my fuckin' jam!!!   Mfw I heard those cymbals start to * click *click * click * click * click * click *"
qotsa,2fdvie,Teenage_Handmodel,2,Wed Sep 3 23:27:58 2014 UTC,"It's not my favorite song they've ever done (it's up there), but it's such a fucking perfect live song. It's so immense and powerful, I could listen to live versions of it all day and still not be bored."
qotsa,2fdvie,StartAlpine,1 point,Thu Sep 4 02:58:28 2014 UTC,I saw them in Rochester on 7/18 and they played Fun Machine. It was fucking amazing.
qotsa,2fdvie,vgman20,1 point,Thu Sep 4 04:22:08 2014 UTC,"Wow no wonder their set lists are so boring these days.  They have 70+ songs in their discography, not to mention B-sides, covers, and Desert Sessions, and they've only played 35 out of those.    I hate to say it, but they are starting to slip into middle age mediocrity."
qotsa,2fdvie,Vayo_Viol,1 point,Thu Sep 4 18:00:11 2014 UTC,"I made a roadtrip out to Kansas City and Tulsa for my 3rd and 4th show of the ....Like Clockwork tour (7x total shows). I was really hoping to hear I Appear Missing one more time and they swapped it in at the encore for Tulsa! Sadly, I Think I Lost My Headache was supposed to be played and that was my close second. Weird to think that might have been the one performance for this year."
qotsa,2fdvie,BinaryChode,1 point,Thu Sep 4 18:50:39 2014 UTC,"I was so sad they didn't play I Appear Missing in Boston when I saw them, that might be my favorite song from them. Killer show otherwise though"

qotsa,2fbvzu,illmatic2112,3,Wed Sep 3 04:51:16 2014 UTC,"I like this a lot! One of the best things about the self titled album was the robotic pulse that it had, this song is almost like a more mechanical take on that energy if that makes sense. As I type this I realize it makes no sense."

qotsa,2fdv0m,Speedtouch1,2,Thu Sep 4 18:21:01 2014 UTC,I've met him once.. It was brief and my conversation with him was odd.
qotsa,2fdv0m,Speedtouch1,2,Thu Sep 4 12:17:57 2014 UTC,"Awesome, what did you talk about? And where did you meet him?"
qotsa,2fdv0m,Speedtouch1,5,Thu Sep 4 14:20:38 2014 UTC,"Aftershow at Birmingham, England back last November.   Backstory - I had Met Nick Oliveri August 2013, he mentioned something about a project he and Josh were working on.  Fast-forward to November - Knowing about the 'project' I thought it would be good to ask, so the conversation goes as follows:  -signing my cd case- ""Hey Josh, I saw Nick back in August""   JH - ""Tell Nick I said 'hey'""  Me- (confused) ""No I meant Nick Nick,""  JH ""Yeah, Nick Oliveri, that's what I meant""   He looked a bit un-impressed so I didn't pursue the conversation any longer.. I went to talk to Jon and Mikey instead."
qotsa,2fdv0m,gregthehobbit,3,Thu Sep 4 15:04:40 2014 UTC,That sounds totally awesome! So how do you get to such an aftershow?
qotsa,2fdv0m,serendipitybot,2,Thu Sep 4 17:46:29 2014 UTC,"My bad.. I meant it as 'after the show' sorry. Should have been more clear. But He was just about to get on the bus and some guy yells ""Josh over here!"" and over he came."

qotsa,2fdv0m,LeftoverBun,1 point,Fri Sep 5 16:48:36 2014 UTC,"He's probably pissed as fuck whenever brings Nick up. Not really because of all the domestic abuse and stuff but it might because so many people argue who is the best bassist or ""Why you get rid of Nick?"" He may have just thought you were gonna say something like that. But I wouldn't doubt that is his humor."
