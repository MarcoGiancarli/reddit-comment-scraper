Everton,3e2hp4,KianKP,6,Tue Jul 21 21:11:55 2015 UTC,"With adding more central midfielders I start to wonder if Martinez plans to use Barry or Besic as a CB. Roberto/Naismith/Osman playing under the striker, with Ross moving back to a deeper position would allow for that.   I think it's a terrible decision if it's what happens, but I wonder."
Everton,3e2hp4,anteni2,3,Tue Jul 21 14:10:38 2015 UTC,"Not an Everton fan but my speculative theory is a diamond. Already got the full-backs for it and Martinez, obviously, is the kind of manager who likes control in central midfield."
Everton,3e2hp4,IlliniToffee,4,Tue Jul 21 14:39:49 2015 UTC,Don't have enough strikers on the squad to play a diamond.  You'd be taking a midfielder off the field for Kone in the starting 11.
Everton,3e2hp4,anteni2,5,Tue Jul 21 14:54:23 2015 UTC,You could play Naismith/Mirallas/Deulofeu as a sort of roaming forward next to Lukaku.
Everton,3e2hp4,KianKP,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:59:33 2015 UTC,No width that way.
Everton,3e2hp4,MrLiamD,2,Tue Jul 21 15:08:10 2015 UTC,The diamond we played against Arsenal with Lukaku and Mirallas wide strikers and Naismith/Barkley as a false 9 worked well. It's sometimes gone very well and sometimes been underwhelming but it's definitely an option. With Deulofeu being another option.
Everton,3e2hp4,KianKP,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:53:23 2015 UTC,"Right, but that only really worked because of Naismith. If we have Roberto in that role I don't think it would have the same effect. Neville and Carragher actually had a really good analysis on why that worked."
Everton,3e2hp4,MrLiamD,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:56:56 2015 UTC,"Nah if we did that then Roberto would play as one of 3 behind the false 9. McCarthy/Barry, Cleverley/Besic/Gibson, Sergi/Osman behind Barkley/Naismith/McAleny, Lukaku and Mirallas/Deulofeu could be good against the right opponent."
Everton,3e2hp4,KianKP,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:14:39 2015 UTC,"I really liked that! When it worked anyway. Mirallas is good up front and he scores goals, i think we should take advantage of that more."
Everton,3e2hp4,anteni2,2,Tue Jul 21 16:19:24 2015 UTC,"The problem with the diamond is that it neutralizes our wingers. One of our best methods of attack in Martinez's first season was fullbacks and wingers overlapping and playing off each other. A back four with a diamond in midfield makes us narrow, which was our problem last year."

I think he'd be a more advanced in a 4-3-3 or maybe 4-2-3-1 though, but is an excellent back up for deep mid if we suffer an injury crisis and like 6 players get injured at once. We do have a lot of central players but barely any creativity among them, he would be a great signing."

Other people give up on football after it, they stopped going the game and everything.  Rumor has it that he was looking at coming back a year or ago when his United deal was up for renewal but his agent pushed him towards the United deal (He's on something like 300 grand isn't he ? Probably wasn't hard to turn that down.)  If he ever plays for us again full time, he'll be past it and it'll be his last pay day. So some people will forgive him (His transfer at the time saved us from administration) but we had the best English talent in a while and let him go. It stings a lot of people so it's understandable that a lot of people still dislike him."
Everton,3e2r7n,Bennett14,9,Tue Jul 21 16:13:49 2015 UTC,I think that time is long passed. It'd be incredibly petty to still hold anything against him in my opinion. I still hold out hope he'll come home when he still has a year or two in his legs.

Naturally left sided, but can also play on the right, two-footed and has good size. Also less of a worry about attitude than Shaqiri. May even be able to slot in as a striker or attacking mid if needed.  Bruno Fernandes- (Udinese) £5M. True number 10 and starting for Udinese at 20. Could be a backup or get loaned back to Udinese for this season. (I know our midfield is stacked but Roberto said he wanted to get a number 10)  Van Dijk- (Celtic) £5M. Young CB, good potential, you know the story.  Evans/Reid- £8M both older, english speaking and have PL experience. We haven't been linked with Reid, but if Mirallas was sold to West Ham perhaps an agreement could be made.  Total £28M."

Everton,3dzah5,supersonicdeathsquad,14,Mon Jul 20 19:57:58 2015 UTC,When wasn't Hibbo an absolute King of the game?
Everton,3dzah5,Someaussie87,4,Mon Jul 20 21:40:34 2015 UTC,I have more faith in Hibbert's ability to score than Kone... That surely says something.
Everton,3dzah5,deadlockedwinter,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:48:30 2015 UTC,McAleny would spell Rom so he doesn't have to always play 90.
Everton,3dzah5,Evertonius,5,Tue Jul 21 14:48:32 2015 UTC,I think we could play a parking meter up front and it would me more effective than Kone.

Everton,3dzah5,Evertonian3,3,Tue Jul 21 01:48:17 2015 UTC,"Martinez was very positive about McAleny in his interviews after the Swindon game, but if he wants to give him a chance it should be sooner rather than later. He turns 23 in August, seems a bit old to be going out on loan."

Everton,3dzah5,velvetelvis6294,2,Tue Jul 21 07:00:10 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. Ease him in, and maybe try him as a winger, which was his usual position in the U21s IIRC."

I don't see him as a lone leading the line type player. He needs to play behind another forward in  my opinion. Not a like for like replacement for Lukaku or Kone."
Everton,3dzah5,EvertonFury19,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:01:11 2015 UTC,Not sure if he's got the build to play a lone striker the way we seem to play it but at this point anyone we've got deserves a chance. Kone has had a lot of time now and I think it's worth giving the likes of McAleny the same opportunity.

Everton,3dyavo,Baggzio,11,Mon Jul 20 15:07:49 2015 UTC,"As a side note, Rooney was a different player when he played for us. When SAF got him he made him a 'team player', more rounded, less exciting and explosive. Watching videos like this (terrible music) you can see what I mean.   It'll definitely be interesting to see how this one goes though. When Everton said they had a special guest I thought it was going to be Cahill not Rooney haha."
Everton,3dyavo,practically_floored,9,Mon Jul 20 15:53:22 2015 UTC,Aaah back in the days when clothes didn't fit anyone
Everton,3dyavo,MogwaiAllOnYourFace,2,Mon Jul 20 17:42:22 2015 UTC,Something absolutely great about it though
Everton,3dyavo,a_s_h_e_n,7,Tue Jul 21 00:32:24 2015 UTC,"Well said on what SAF did to Wayne, IMO Wayne took a nose dive while he played with Ronaldo, he changed from a player that had to do something to make things happen to a player that just sat and waited for chances/something to happen.  Selling Wayne was one of the worst/best things we did but from a raw talent PoV he would have been a far better player had he stayed with us."
Everton,3dyavo,robjapan,8,Mon Jul 20 16:06:52 2015 UTC,"Yep. I mean Rooney can now play in midfield, he's been put out on the wing for England and people rate him highly as a number 10, and that's great. But as a pure striker he was already world class at Everton, and if the United team had been built around Rooney instead of Ronaldo I feel like he would be up there on the Messi/Ronaldo level rather than a tier or two below it."
Everton,3dyavo,practically_floored,6,Mon Jul 20 16:14:41 2015 UTC,You nailed it! Remember when he played for England Vs France that time and he single handedly forced the entire defensive half of the French team back and then Erikksson took him off and we lost 1-2 because the French instantly realized that Heskey wasn't a threat and just pushed on us with everything they had....  Like Don King robbed us of the real Iron Mike I feel like SAF robbed us of the real Wayne Rooney. If you minus the Penalties from his goal tally he's barely scratching an average striker's record..... and for a lad of his talent.... quite frankly..... that's fucking miserable.
Everton,3dyavo,robjapan,2,Mon Jul 20 16:18:50 2015 UTC,God he kinda reminds me of barkley or deo with that explosive energy and passion in the video

Most of you are probably too young to remember football before the Premiere League, but I was a boy in the 50's and 60's and United were the club that was most hated. The kopites of course became a great club in the 1970's but they weren't the big match in the 60's. I'll always hate United more. I had far too many battles with them over the years."

Everton,3dyavo,Geo1245,4,Mon Jul 20 15:05:39 2015 UTC,Is there a big reason for this or is it just a cool random thing?
Everton,3dyavo,practically_floored,12,Mon Jul 20 15:12:09 2015 UTC,Rooney grew up as a fan of Dunc and Duncan was captain when Rooney broke into the first team. In a testimonial you sometimes get random players from the past playing and I guess Rooney/Duncan both wanted him to play.
Everton,3dyavo,Dr_Sayonara,5,Mon Jul 20 15:20:11 2015 UTC,"Just a nice gesture from one of England's best strikers, pretty kind of him to recognise Dunc's talent."
Everton,3dyavo,PerryDigital,2,Mon Jul 20 15:19:52 2015 UTC,What? He was raised an Evertonian. Watching him play. Then played alongside him. It's a bit more involved than a nice gesture from an England player.

Sorry mates I want him to stay for a long time. I feel like this group is special. We need to sort some things out but we've got talent coming up and a young spine of Lukaku, Barkley, McCarthy, Stones; and Coleman Garbutt as the backs not to mention Cleverly as a replacement for Barry and Deulofeu on the wing.   We should be pushing for top 6 this season."
Everton,3e0brj,supersonicdeathsquad,2,Tue Jul 21 00:18:01 2015 UTC,"I don't think he's going anywhere. He'll probably be worth as much, if not more next year and we'll get the benefit of another season with him.    But don't check the odds on it, you might vom.    Proper vom."

Everton,3e0brj,Sean0925,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:05:03 2015 UTC,I think we should definitely keep him for another season even if he wants to go himself. If he plays well this year and gets in the England team and does well there we'll be in a position where a lot of teams are after him (I'd rather him go to anyone but Chelsea) and we can likely get a lot more for him.
Everton,3e0brj,PieandPeas,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:48:51 2015 UTC,"If the player wants to go you always sell them. It's not good to have a player who doesn't want to be with the club. I've seen that too many times to know it doesn't end well. I haven't heard anything that makes me believe Stones wants to leave but if the money is massive as it sounds like it is I would expect the move to go through. I don't want him to go at all. I think it would be bad for him as well to sit at Chelsea and see less time on the pitch than he would see with us. However, we all know the game today is all about £ and he clubs that have it will get their players. It's the worst part of the modern game"
Everton,3e0brj,Sean0925,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:32:57 2015 UTC,"To be honest I don't necessarily think Stones will want to leave just yet but I do understand what you're saying. I think he would understand if we said wait till the end of this season and see where things are for himself and us, we consider him a key player and someone hard to replace and he's got a big season ahead.   It's a huge season for him before the euro's to truly and try and establish himself as one of the best young defenders in the world, if he goes to Chelsea now a lot of the hard work he's put in the last couple of years could go down the drain whilst sitting on the bench and potentially miss out on being a starter at the Euro's."
Everton,3e0brj,broiamsohigh,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:12:30 2015 UTC,"I really dont think hes going to leave.   It would be beneficial for both Stones and Everton for him to stay another season and Im sure both parties are aware of this. With this season Stones can guarantee (100%) first team football for him, which he cannot if he leaves for Chelsea. On top of that if he impresses next season better offers for him may come and he can guarantee a better spot in his future team. If he stays another season his value wont really go down (unless he starts playing shit, which he probably wont) since he signed a new contract and if he plays well Im sure Everton can sell him for more than 32m(?).   Im not too hurt, ever since I heard the hype around him when Moyes got him Ive had a hunch he was due for great things. I just hope if he wants to leave he will be respectful to the club and the fans (unlike Kev)."

Everton,3dv6tl,keyboardbitch,5,Sun Jul 19 22:42:41 2015 UTC,I'd say he's underrated due to a couple of ugly mistakes- he dealt well with Villa's awful defense this past season and has been AMAZING for the USA recently.
Everton,3dv6tl,camel_victory,4,Sun Jul 19 22:42:25 2015 UTC,Two million more for ospina though apparently
Everton,3dv6tl,MogwaiAllOnYourFace,3,Sun Jul 19 20:42:10 2015 UTC,"From a business perspective, he seems like a good way to keep a hold on Everton's USA fanbase. Once Howard retires/fades from American memories, someone needs to carry the torch. It's not like shifting the team's focus to the Asian market is paying great dividends. Even if he's not an upgrade on the pitch, a marketing upgrade can be even more helpful for the club long term. I'd still lean pretty strongly towards splashing the cash to get Ospina, but if Ospina won't come or ends up being too costly, a cheap Guzan seems like an above average middle-term solution."

Everton,3dv6tl,thinkaboutthegame,2,Sun Jul 19 20:31:09 2015 UTC,I'd only want him as a back up. Wouldn't be a big enough improvement as a starter to make it worth it.
Everton,3dv6tl,MrLiamD,4,Sun Jul 19 20:22:48 2015 UTC,Guzan has a higher ceiling than Howard and is frustratingly undervalued at villa. He'd be a steal at $3M and could push Howard wayyyyy more than Robles ever could.

At the end of the day, Arsenal are a very, very popular club, especially in foreign countries like Singapore, and I'm pretty sure the guys in charge of selling merch knew that, so of course they would have tried to sell Arsenal merchandise at a higher rate that the other teams involved.

Everton,3dss4q,PieandPeas,4,Sun Jul 19 08:02:07 2015 UTC,Its also probably because Arsenal has more products to sell than us.

Everton,3dqc3b,MrLiamD,2,Sat Jul 18 14:54:19 2015 UTC,"It's definitely a possible starting XI. Other than Chambers for Mertesacker, but I think Chambers isn't far behind and will get a lot of game time this year, it's mainly the midfield which could be argued but that will change a lot, players like Wilshere and Walcott will not be happy getting very little game time and a lot of Arsenal fans I've spoken to want them both as regular starters, Coq and Sanchez are first choice over them but if this team started a premier league game the only surprise would be Sanchez not playing and he's injured. So yeah, it's pretty much the first team and best available one."
Everton,3dqc3b,NarwhalWhat,-1,Sat Jul 18 15:06:06 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter how good you think the players are, they're not starting XI players in our squad. That's the point, it doesn't matter why the players are playing so you don't need to reason it out, this was not our full strength team."
Everton,3dqc3b,MrLiamD,2,Sat Jul 18 15:25:57 2015 UTC,"My point was nothing to do with how good I think they are so try arguing the point I'm actually making. Wilshere and Walcott were injured for lots of last season and a lot of Arsenal fans have been saying they'll get a lot of game time and I agree, it's a variant on first team that will be used, there isn't a single first team. Who exactly isn't a possible first team choice other than Chambers? Chambers was the only player you could possibly have interpreted me saying I rate him so it's not a B team choice, but that was not my point and you've misinterpreted me. I think he will be used a decent amount as Mertesacker is ageing and Gabriel hasn't had a lot of experience in the league and hasn't played consistently throughout his career. You saying ""this was not our full strength team"" is as much opinion as mine, if you put Sanchez in that team (and he only missed out as he is injured), then there's only one spot where you can say it likely won't be first team. Just because a couple of them didn't start regularly at the end of last season doesn't mean they aren't first team. You're quite frankly just wrong."
Everton,3dqc3b,NarwhalWhat,-3,Sat Jul 18 16:25:46 2015 UTC,"This is not our full strength team. I don't see what's hard to understand. I can't be bothered to read your whole essay but regarding the first sentence, maybe you should be more clear. The point is, the team we played today aren't the players that would play in a full strength team. If you want to argue that and want me to respond then you're going to have to make it short because I'm on holiday and am not going to try to read through everything and combat each point."

Everton,3dqc3b,MrLiamD,2,Sat Jul 18 13:11:49 2015 UTC,This might be unpopular but Coleman had to put a lot more pressure on him for the goal. Looked like he was just desperate to not give away a penalty.
Everton,3dqc3b,Everton_11,5,Sat Jul 18 12:54:18 2015 UTC,"Some fault is his, of course, but that was a fantastic run. Joel needs to recognize, though, that there's no way he can get that ball, and so he's basically taken himself out of the equation. He can't react to any finish from that close. Good goal from Walcott, but helped by mistakes on both Joel and Coleman's parts, I think."
Everton,3dqc3b,MrLiamD,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:13:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'd agree with you there, they both could have done better but it is a friendly, and it was a great pass and finish so nothing to worry about really."

Everton,3dnv5f,joecool519,14,Fri Jul 17 22:25:19 2015 UTC,"That's overstating it a little. Until proven otherwise, John Terry is certainly the best center back in the league, and personally, I'd list Kompany, Jags, Koscielny, Mertesacker, maybe others as better. That being said, I can't think of a defender anywhere near his age who's as good, except maybe Zouma. Regardless, Chelsea and everyone else can keep their stinking paws off John Stones."

Now some choose to do those two things in variable extremes but then that's just people.  1) 100% agree, Kone is terrible.  2) I agree to a certain extent, but we don't have a lot of money to do a lot about it, we have great young players coming through and we've bought geri and clevs in so far while maintaning the likes of Baines, Coleman, Mirallas, Stones.. Also I think Naismith is  a good player.  4) I think you need some perspective on what it's like to support a true ""stale"" club. Try supporting southend or brighton and hove albion or how about being a long time Leeds Utd fan? You know what I mean?  5) The long sleeves are kinda nasty though."

Everton,3dqpwh,robjapan,8,Sun Jul 19 04:24:30 2015 UTC,"These are all pretty valid points. The only thing I don't understand though is when you say we are a squad lacking quality. Kone and Hibbert almost never play unless someone is injured, and Naisy actually had one of his best years ever while playing minimal minutes. We have a perfect blend of veterans and young blood, and we didn't even field our best team today, whilst Arsenal did. This was to be expected, and the fact that people even care about preseason results is kind of dumb. It doesn't matter what the score is, ESPECIALLY IF WE DIDNT EVEN FIELD OUR BEST TEAM."

I don't like this negativity so early on in the season. We were playing a rested arsenal squad in a friendly.   Kone sucks true, and Hibbo is a cult favorite who doesn't play much as a back up for Seamus Coleman. You don't know what you're talking about with Naismith. He's first an agitator who has a good feel for the game, a good touch with the ball, and a very good finisher.   Take a breath mate and exhale. I don't think we will be signing another striker this transfer window. My hope is Barkley will play a more forward role and would play the position if necessary."

Everton,3dqpwh,supersonicdeathsquad,3,Sun Jul 19 11:20:27 2015 UTC,"This game finally made it so apparent to me why we find goals and attacking so hard to come by - we don't pass while running.  Our players pass and receive passes while almost standing still.  Arsenal was always in motion, we were static.  I don't know why this is, it's not like we have slow players.  The one goal we got was because we were running forward   It's like Roberto thinks offense is a game of chess.  Even Messi would have a hard time receiving a pass while he's standing still and triple marked right on the 18 yard box.  Keep moving, guys!"

Might be biased but I think he's the best passing CB in the league, and in a few seasons will be the best outright centre back."
Everton,3dlwvf,keyboardbitch,5,Fri Jul 17 11:41:59 2015 UTC,"Let's be honest, if they offer £50m we will probably take it as that is huge money that could buy us 3-4 good players.  And let's not forget he only cost us £1.5m - that's a monstrous profit."

If you were a kid from Barnsley would you want to play for a middle table team on decent wages, or make obscene wages playing for the Premier League champions?

All our best players are very young, that's so promising. Keep them all for the next 4-5 years playing together and we're challenging for a title and some CL ball."
Everton,3dmdgr,everydaydude,-1,Fri Jul 17 17:31:10 2015 UTC,That's the way negotiations start. You give them a bid that they will turn down. Then your bid moves up and up. It's just negotiations. If they don't like the bid they will just say no.
Everton,3dmdgr,nbyone,2,Fri Jul 17 16:52:39 2015 UTC,It's the price that's insulting.   If sterling is worth 49 million then a future England captain is worth 80 million.

Whether a team wants to pay that is another story but I think I speak for most of us here when I say that Stones is almost certainly going to go on and be one of the best defenders around and if Sterling is worth 49 million based on potential then the same should be done with Stones when assessing his value.

Whereas if we wait for a few more seasons, his stock will continue to go up, while Browning and Galloway get better and better, and we buy a new starter centre back, then we can sell him for record money anyway.

Tim needs someone to challenge him and Joel is capable of doing that. However what if Joel goes back to 2013 Joel instead of 2014 Joel? Also as much as we loved him last year, he hasn't really proven himself over a prolonged period in the league. We can't afford to take that much of a gamble."

Everton,3dmk4c,Jo3Fr3sh,5,Fri Jul 17 18:43:03 2015 UTC,Tim can play out of his mind when he is on his game. However sometimes he takes unnecessary chances and these bad decisions affect the game in a bad way. Aside from the occasional howler brain fart which can lead to a run of bad form he is a quality keeper. I just wish he was more consistent.

Sure tim can be amazing but Buffon has been amazing for seasons... years... a decade and more. There isn't even one hint of a doubt when I write this.    Buffon is clearly one of the best goalkeepers the game has ever seen while Howard wasn't ever the best goalkeeper of the league.    Don't get me wrong, I love Everton and I really like Howard. But there is no doubt that there has always been a better keeper in the league since Howard started to play in England. One thing to note though is that Howard is probably among the best penalty killers."
Everton,3dmk4c,high_side,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:51:50 2015 UTC,No just refuting that 36 is past retirement for a goalkeeper.
Everton,3dmk4c,keyboardbitch,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:06:23 2015 UTC,"I'd even state that with keepers it is like with good scotch: the older, the better. :)    36 is not retiring age. i am just not so confident in howard anymore after last season. sure he can play a couple of seasons more... i just hope that it's not downhill for him."
Everton,3dmk4c,high_side,0,Sat Jul 18 15:05:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah but Howard on his day doesn't even touch Buffon on an average day.    I mean, I'm not saying Howard is nearly as good as Buffon, but saying something patently, provable false doesn't help the discussion.  Edit: unless it was not obvious, Belgium and Wolfsburg were not an average Buffon day. If you think otherwise you need to reassess your ability to form a weighted opinion."
Everton,3dmk4c,keyboardbitch,5,Sat Jul 18 18:57:48 2015 UTC,Because Howard just had a dreadful season? We need a consistent keeper or atleast play someone than will eventually become our number 1 (Robles possibly).
Everton,3dmk4c,high_side,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:06:36 2015 UTC,*Dreadful spell that just might have been coupled with some extremely poor defense/Alcaraz.  He set the record for Europa League saves last season.
Everton,3dmk4c,LanceFromPokemon,2,Sat Jul 18 18:51:06 2015 UTC,He single-handedly cost us points last season.    He set the record for Europa League saves last season.   This proves my point - he can be great at times but incredibly shit aswell. We need a consistent keeper.
Everton,3dmk4c,doggegg,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:23:14 2015 UTC,"Maybe. I might take a keeper who is shit against a promoted side and unstoppable against City, with the expectation that the outfield players will rise to the occasion.  Also I don't see where you said he was great some of the time."
Everton,3dmk4c,unfitsportsman,5,Sun Jul 19 02:07:31 2015 UTC,"I just don't think Joel is considered sufficient backup quality for a club that wants to break in to the top 5 of the EPL. Tim Howard is getting pretty old, even if he is in the best shape of any 36 year-old I've ever seen. I wouldn't call it ""urgent"", but we definitely need to be thinking about the line of succession. If a deal like Ospina comes along and we don't take it, I can see us kicking ourselves down the road."
Everton,3dmk4c,doggegg,2,Fri Jul 17 14:35:09 2015 UTC,"If a deal like Ospina comes along and we don't take it, I can see us kicking ourselves down the road.   This is the explanation that makes the most sense to me at the moment."
Everton,3dmk4c,Sean0925,3,Fri Jul 17 14:40:40 2015 UTC,"How about Mathew Ryan, he is perfect for our play style with some of the best distribution in the world. His purchase would grow the club massive amounts in Australia and could be our number 1 for 10 years. I'm biased as fuck though, I really want an Aussie in the team!"
Everton,3dmk4c,high_side,2,Fri Jul 17 16:33:21 2015 UTC,"How how I never heard of this guy? He looks extremely athletic, tremendous positioning, and that throw he makes in that video...wow."
Everton,3dmk4c,6Jonnie6,2,Fri Jul 17 16:55:31 2015 UTC,He also had won Belgium keeper of the year twice in a row! I'm pretty sure he was an outfielder until he was 16 or something at a decent level when he switched so he has very good feet
Everton,3dmk4c,JimmyGlazz,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:35:29 2015 UTC,I played him at state titles when ! was 16 and he came out of goals at half time and scored a hattrick... So yeah... He is really good with his feet.
Everton,3dmk4c,high_side,2,Fri Jul 17 23:14:01 2015 UTC,Howard didn't have the best of seasons last year and while he did improve towards the end it's still worrying going forward. Joel I'm more confident in as a backup than before but I'm still not convinced he should start for us and think we could get better if we looked for it.
Everton,3dmk4c,JimmyGlazz,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:01:38 2015 UTC,He had a very good European campaign.
Everton,3dmk4c,high_side,0,Sat Jul 18 19:07:41 2015 UTC,"I don't think Joel should be the starter either, but I'm fine with him as the long term second choice, and emergency first team in case of injury."
Everton,3dmk4c,high_side,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:17:04 2015 UTC,"So then why not get rid of Howard, get a replacement, and have the replacement and Joel fight it out for the no.1 spot? If you think Howard is going to get better, you're in for a shock"
Everton,3dmk4c,PieandPeas,0,Fri Jul 17 23:23:16 2015 UTC,"And what makes you he authority on Howard to be so certain? He was excellent at the World Cup and rubbish when the season started. He didn't fall off a cliff in a couple months time. It was more likely a bad spell and a small decline in talent.   I'm fine with replacing him, I just don't want us to break the bank on a keeper, when we aren't that bad in that position to begin with.   If we are going to let Joel fight with someone else for first team spot, might as well be Howard."
Everton,3dmk4c,broiamsohigh,2,Fri Jul 17 23:34:40 2015 UTC,cas (statisticly wise) last season howard was the worst keeper in EPL  and Martinez don't want to risk making Joel #1 choice

Everton,3dmk4c,broiamsohigh,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:46:10 2015 UTC,No way for that to be misleading.
Everton,3dmk4c,high_side,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:05:13 2015 UTC,"Does anyone else feel that while talented, Joel may not have the physical presence of a Howard or Cech. On that first goal today he committed in but seemed to shy away from contact - which of course is a good idea in a friendly.  He had some good saves today but it wasn't very encouraging. Certainly not on the level of praise he received when Howard returned last season."
Everton,3dmk4c,broiamsohigh,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:06:16 2015 UTC,Howard has played far too many matches since he's been with the club. We either need to play the young Spanish lad more or find another keeper. Howard can't keep playing all these matches
Everton,3dmk4c,high_side,0,Sun Jul 19 21:25:47 2015 UTC,"I have no idea why everyone thinks Joel is so good. One good performance against West Ham and a couple of decent ones in the midst of horrid performances does not mean he should be first choice. About Howard: he's old, and he's not like Buffon he has had some horrible performances this season... I mean horrible... The fact that the majority of fans prefer Joel over Howard speaks a lot about his declining quality. It is time to get a new keeper. I mean, we are not in a life or death situation but we certainly could be next season. A young keeper (in GK years) like Ospina has us covered for a little less than ten seasons if be stays. I honestly think he is perfect for the club, he is amazing and definitely wants to play in a quality team who can provide constant first team action."
Everton,3dnf44,Snovs202,3,Fri Jul 17 18:11:41 2015 UTC,"Howard    Coleman       Jagielka     Stones      Baines (if fit, if not Galloway)                 McCarthy      Cleverley  Deulofeu               Barkley            Mirallas                        Lukaku   That's what I hope for, wouldn't be too surprised to see Mirallas start on the bench, Cleverley further forward and Barry in."
Everton,3dnf44,MrLiamD,5,Fri Jul 17 18:49:27 2015 UTC,I get the impression Deulofeu won't be fit to play 90 right away.  Think he'll come off the bench the first couple of appearances.
Everton,3dnf44,IlliniToffee,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:55:36 2015 UTC,"It's not unlikely, I mainly just put my ideal starting XI, although if we play that team it would be more 4-3-3 than the 4-2-3-1 I set it up as. I don't see Pienaar as 100% fit either, which is why I see either Deulofeu or Mirallas dropped for Barry and Cleverley moved to the left as a real possibility."
Everton,3dnf44,MrLiamD,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:04:24 2015 UTC,"Cleverley or maybe Osman, yeah.  I'm still not exactly sure how Cleverley is going to fit into all of this. I wasn't enthusiastic about the signing but so far he's shown some creativity passing.  If he's basically Osman for the next five years that's not at all a bad free signing."
Everton,3dnf44,IlliniToffee,4,Fri Jul 17 20:10:07 2015 UTC,"I see Gaz being almost certainly picked to pair Macca in the holding role. Back five and Lukaku basically pick themselves. However, The three behind Rom I don't see working. There's no one to play the pass in those three, and against a newly promoted team that will almost certainly defend, deeply and compactly, there's a requirement for someone with the capability and unselfishness to give the assists. So, I think one of those three, most likely Deulofeu, starting on the bench, with either Osman or Pienaar opposite Mirallas, or even Cleverley deployed further up the pitch. Last season he demonstrated that he's far more adept further up the pitch, and that's something Martinez understands."
Everton,3dnf44,Everton_11,2,Fri Jul 17 22:08:31 2015 UTC,I'm guessing that Cleverly will start on the bench and Barry will get the nod in that spot. Otherwise looks about right. Pienaar may get the start over Mirallas but I'd prefer Kevin in there so we can get some good chances going early.

Everton,3dnf44,dan0005,5,Fri Jul 17 18:51:24 2015 UTC,"I still don't think that Besic is ready to play in the first team over veterans like Barry and Cleverly. I love Besic, but he still has a ways to go before he is picked over any of our other CDMs. He makes some poor decisions (Tottenham comes to mind) and is a bit too reckless still. However, I wouldn't be surprised to see Martinez use him as the final nail in the coffin-type sub to seal out the game."
Everton,3dnf44,MuhamedBesic,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:00:01 2015 UTC,Yeah I can see Barry in for Mirallas sadly and a slight shape change seeing Cleverley on the inside left. Although he's not played there in pre-season so maybe not.

Everton,3dlafc,keyboardbitch,11,Fri Jul 17 05:06:14 2015 UTC,"Would like him in the team, but for Gibbo sort of prices. He would be great as a backup, but £8m for a backup is a bit too much."
Everton,3dlafc,layendecker,4,Fri Jul 17 08:45:55 2015 UTC,"Have an upvote.  I think we're likely to sign this sort of player.  I suspect Martinez wants Galloway and Browning to get some chances to play this season and mature.  That leads me to think he's going to sign 1 centre back, and that guy should be experienced, solid and I guess, cheap.  Reading between the lines I think what's happened is that Martinez made the enquiry, saw the price and said ""nope"".  I suspect he wants to spend the the bulk of the cash he has left to bring in one more offensive midfield player (presumably a left sided one).  His statements about the strength of the current squad are hard to read (he's relentlessly, and annoyingly positive) but I do have that feeling he's got a lot of faith in the young boys coming through.  I'd sooner have that than more signings like Alzcarez, and Kone."
Everton,3dlafc,tealeg,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:54:37 2015 UTC,Clearly we're going to get that lad from Celtic that everyone is clamoring for.

Everton,3dlafc,FluorescentChair,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:12:15 2015 UTC,Yeah but everyone has been talking him up as if he is going to solve all of our problems. I don't know anything about him and I suspect most don't either so don't understand basis for it.
