DobermanPinscher,3d5d2h,mastererrob,3,Mon Jul 13 19:05:06 2015 UTC,"I've heard some Dobes don't float that well and that can be the cause of them not liking very deep water. A dog life jacket fixes that. Some dogs just don't swim very well naturally either. It's a good idea to go in the water and swim with them for the first few times. That way they are more comfortable and relaxed with you near by, helping them move.  You might even want to check to see if anyone local offers swimming lessons. A trainer near us offers swimming lessons and gently introduces dogs to the water and swim/play.  We put our Dobie in lessons and she was very tense and nervous the first two times then became more comfortable and played after that."
DobermanPinscher,3d5d2h,KimChi_Possible,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:08:09 2015 UTC,Upvote for the dog life jacket!! Make sure you get a good one with a sturdy handle on top. If a cheapo handle breaks lifting your dog into a boat/onto a dock etc it's troublesome to get them out of the water if there isn't a bank nearby.    As far as acclimating them to the water we would bring her in the water early on and just hold her and float around so it was a safe experience until she got the idea.

DobermanPinscher,3d5d2h,infiity,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:39:30 2015 UTC,"My little lady was definitely hesitant with approaching water when I first adopted her (9 months-ish), but slowly progressed. We started out cooling off with paws in the water, which turned into zoomies in the water, and next thing I knew she was chasing other dogs/retrieving toys in water she couldn't just stand in. The excitement that everyone else mentioned is absolutely what got her in.  It seems like her chest always floats and her butt sinks. She has a life vest, which was hard to find in a good size because of her chestiness, but I truly believe she feels safer in it. She is a fawn with alopecia (basically she is naked) so she's used to clothes- a dog who isn't might be less enthused and made even more panicky by one.She seems a bit more willing to venture further with it on.

DobermanPinscher,3d2wi3,mastererrob,2,Mon Jul 13 02:25:37 2015 UTC,Sounds like she's timid of strangers. Proper socialization should help. She needs to go out and meet people. She needs to be shown people are okay and to not fear them. Your pup will look to you for guidance. Don't baby her or show extra attention to soothe her when she's scared or backing away. Reward her when she's calm around strangers and when she's approaching them to get her sniffs in.
DobermanPinscher,3d2wi3,BluKab00se,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:25:15 2015 UTC,"I haven't treated her after more calm approaches, which is something I'll make a note to do, and can orchestrate that, she has a tether on her bed, and when someone comes in, I was coached to tether her with a kong, and only let off when she's relaxed and calm [rewarding relaxed behavior]   I just got frustrated at a BBQ last night as more people came she always bum rushed them, and one or two people that were the combination of overly friendly and unfamiliar with her that she would give them random barks.  She's around people often, daily walks into town, sitting in my craft beer store, but not greeting them at home, and on the leash, which is very different.  Seems more and more to me a service where a supply of strangers simply knock on your door and have different levels of entry would be valuable, yes somewhat silly, but valuable for dog owners. It's hard to get friends to do it! Thanks for the response."
DobermanPinscher,3d2wi3,BluKab00se,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:18:06 2015 UTC,That great to know she's comfortable meeting and being around strangers outside the home. I think it's correct to reward relaxed behaviors. We have the complete opposite of timid whenever people come over. She's a jumper and very mouthy with her greetings. Whenever anyone comes over we have her lay down or sit and treat her as she lays calmy. We have treats in the entry way and she is given treats and can greet new comers only if she's staying down and calm. This can be a pain when entertaining a larger group but its better than her knocking someone down or putting someone off with her toothyness. We also tell our guests about what we're doing. Guest always seem to arrive in waves and just as she's back to normal the next group shows up and we get to start agian.

DobermanPinscher,3d267a,hellomisterjedi,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:37:34 2015 UTC,"As an owner of a 9-year old, very lumpy Dobe and 2nd year veterinary student at A&M, you are indeed correct in that the only way to know for sure is to have it aspirated and the contents checked out under a microscope. My boy has large lipomas in both axillary regions and this is not an uncommon site for them to show up. Does the lump feel soft? Can you get your fingers around it (i.e. is it subcutaneous)? Does it appear painful when manipulated/touched?   I can't give you a precise quote for what your vet would charge, since prices tend to vary from state to state and city to city. Lipomas can be diagnosed by most any general practitioner without too much difficulty as lipomas have a very obvious histological appearance. I'd say exam + FNA would be around $100 for both, give or take. If the lump seems questionable, it may be sent for a pathologist's review and that could be more expensive. If it is a lipoma, I would not be concerned with removal unless it decreases your pup's quality of life.    Also, some things to watch for that may necessitate you get your boy to the vet ASAP are if the lump grows or shrinks rapidly, changes texture, becomes painful/hot. Lipomas do grow in size, but often very slowly.   Hope this helps! Good luck!"
DobermanPinscher,3d267a,Doc_Wildlife,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:28:54 2015 UTC,"Ah, axillary region. I'm rather disappointed that I couldn't get the term off the tip of my tongue and into writing when I made this post. Glad to bump into another Dobe owner here in this sub, and even happier to know that you're a V1 at A&M. Congrats on that, btw!   The lump is indeed soft, and is subcutaneous. Touching the apex, or feeling around the mass itself causes no pain, and quite honestly, doesn't illicit any sort of response from my pup.   Thank you, most greatly for the full-blown response; I truly appreciate it. Is it necessary to ask around and find a ""highly sought after"" vet here locally? Our go-to family vet was located in Dallas, but I'm very unlikely to make the trip back up there simply for this issue at hand. Would you by any chance possibly know of someone you might personally recommend in or about Houston? (If this is your neck of the woods, or that of a friend/associate of yours)  I've been monitoring the lump since I first discovered it. It has grown over the course of the past six months, but not even remotely near being a ""rapid"" growth. In fact, it wasn't even really discernible that it was growing in size until after the fact, when I reflected back on how I previously recall it to have been.  Thanks so much, once again!  ps: I very quickly skimmed your most recent post history; I hope you don't mind my asking, but what were your other two degrees in?"

Pure breed dogs have particular diseases of varying degrees depending on the breed. I wouldn't group all pure breeds into disease riddled dogs. Yes, there are a few things to look out for in a Doberman but just like most other breeds. I wouldn't single out ""especially"" Dobermans.    As far as shady breeders and sudden puppy death. I think too many people put their trust in pure breed = responsible breeder and care taker. It's up to each individual to do some research and make an informed decision about where they are getting their puppy. If the breeder doesn't care about the well being of his animals then you don't know what you're going to find. It doesn't matter if its a champion breed line or a couple of backyard mixes.   We got our girl from a first time back yard breeder earlier this year. The owner seemed sincere, the parents were on property and the dogs appeared happy and content.

She's a spaz still, for sure, but that's because neither of us were built for this hellish cold weather that we moved into an apartment in the middle of.  Fuck the white shit up in the north.  She see's her coat and boots as punishment now.  That means we are going on a walk in the cold.  So, yeah, if you live in a cold place, beware of the adolescent phase.  They will become shitheads.    Otherwise, see littermate syndrome above."

DobermanPinscher,3c9al0,Nopulse10,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:46:19 2015 UTC,"Since you are adopting from a shelter there's only so much you can do. If possible, find out who the parents are and their health history. If you can't, the best you might be able to do is take the puppy to the vet for a full health exam to catch any already present problems. You can't really know about joint and such issues until they get older. (If you had the health history of parents and prior you could make a more educated decision, but it's still not a guarantee) You can help by making sure to give your puppy healthy/high quality food, appropriate exercise and visit the vet as required/needed. Side note: we have a purebred Doberman and a Boxer mix and they are the best of friends."

DobermanPinscher,3awjho,jfritz12,2,Wed Jun 24 01:58:26 2015 UTC,"Finding a Doberman puppy in a shelter especially when you have a gender preference isn't going to be that easy unless you live in a big city. I live in a city of 200,000 and I put requests in at 3 shelters (local and two about 2 hours away out of city) for a young Doberman  And over two years I got two calls. One was very obviously mixed, possibly rottie or even shepherd and the other looked like it might have been a min pin  I ended up buying a Doberman from a reputable breeder   I'm all for adoption but if that is the route you are going please consider adopting an adult dog as well.  Also, I personally find female dobies to be more stubborn and heard headed and males to be more easy going and goofy   Keep in mind that dobermans need lots of exercise and attention. They are needy and will need to go on long stimulating adventures every day. They are killer smart so if they get bored and don't get to burn off their energy they will get into trouble, be very annoying and be very whiny  If you are going to be away and your mom isn't up for taking the dog on a long (hour) walk every day I would not suggest this breed"
DobermanPinscher,3awjho,Blondeambitchion,2,Wed Jun 24 17:58:09 2015 UTC,"I agree about the gender info you mentioned. i have had 2 males and 1 female. the females are more hard headed. I like everything about the males over females except that if the males get out they are harder to get to come back. this is when they are young. the females don't run off as much. 3 months to train any dong is not enough time. you are basically getting a dog for your mother and she needs to feel confident in training the dog. they are easy to train/ very intelligent. I would make sure you get a puppy and make sure its a purebred. A doberman that is older and poorly trained is not a good thing.   lastly, i have had a black and tan, a blue, and a fawn (color). the fawn and blue are off colors and their hair is coarse and tends to fall out when they get older. I am not sure why but this makes them need a bath more often because they smell. the black and tan don't seem to have this problem and their coat is sleek and soft. this should be the least of your worries but i thought i would mention it. i would never get anything other than black after having the  3."
DobermanPinscher,3awjho,mattkirschling,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:54:23 2015 UTC,"I have had 5 Dobermans, 3 females and 2 males. One of the males was an older rescue, so my source pool is small.   The females were all easier to train, eager to please, and better guard dogs.  I currently have one of each, and the male has required a lot more attention(Don't we all?). He is a great pet and very well trained, he is just a little stubborn."
DobermanPinscher,3awjho,Eastender1,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:02:52 2015 UTC,"I've had both dobies and border collies. If you can deal with the energy of a border collie a dobie is no problem. My dobie is a smart as the border collie, just more stubborn. While the border collie would literally do anything you asked without fear of consequence, my Dobie would often look at me like ""ah, nope"".   The Doberman is a better family dog. As said, he's a big lovable goofball. He's happiest when his kids and family are around him all day. He will literally lay in the middle of chaos because those are his peeps."

DobermanPinscher,39vy57,SonVoltMMA,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:57:25 2015 UTC,From what I have been told they are pretty safe...they are not cooked so they don't splinter or shard.

DobermanPinscher,39688x,softinside,4,Tue Jun 9 15:32:08 2015 UTC,"I grew up with three Dobermans. We lived out in the middle of nowhere on 18 acres and I could roam around (from the age of 3 and up) with just one of them following me. He was my protector, pillow, playmate and so much more.

DobermanPinscher,39688x,UEMcGill,3,Thu Jun 11 17:38:00 2015 UTC,"Socializing children and dogs is important for any breed. The larger and more physically capable the dog the more important that children are educated, the longer they require supervision, the more important the dog is socialized to children, and the more observant you need to be to signs of discomfort, fear and aggression in the dog... But this isn't unique to dobbies. As far as I'm aware they have great reputations for being gentle with children."

DobermanPinscher,39688x,Wanhope,2,Tue Jun 9 19:52:41 2015 UTC,"Good but like any large dogs need to be socialized early with as many children/animals as possible. They are protective of the family and children so they need to be brought up carefully so they don't have undesired tendencies (like nipping at your kids playmates if they roughouse!)  Just be aware that if you get the dog when you have young children, they are going to have a sad life lesson when they are still pretty young. (Dobes unfortunately have some health problems that can result in somewhat early and sudden deaths. Not always, but a huge number of cancer cases are in Dobes specifically.)"

This website managed to ruin it's credibility in one fell swoop.  That said, dobermans make great family pets, because they are very sensitive and empathetic.  That said, it all depends on the Doberman, how they are raised, etc.  Edit to say: my two year old Dobie is a certified therapy dog, so that definitely proves they have the potential.  She also loves and is very gentle with my 2 year old neice."

He dies 3 years ago. I haven't even thought about it with our doberman, but I thinks she's settled down enough now to make it a possibility."

Renters @ 25k of coverage and 60K in life insurance.  I get a single bill everymonth for everything and it's about 300 a month.  Also I've had to use my auto once and my renters once and the whole process was completely no hastle.  I'll never use a differant company."

We bought her some salmon oil to put on her food and after a couple of weeks using it she is so so silky. I don't see nearly as much dandruff anymore. I'm not sure if that will help or not since your puppy seems to have it just in her ears. But it might

DobermanPinscher,38km7k,Gochu_Annihilator,2,Sat Jun 6 04:30:32 2015 UTC,I got it at place called wag n' wash. It's a dog specialty store.  So maybe check around your area for places that specialize in dog supplies. It's a liquid oil (not a pill) that we just spray on her food and mix it in.
DobermanPinscher,38km7k,RoguePierogi,3,Sat Jun 6 06:31:37 2015 UTC,"Mine gets a little flaky in her ears too! She's a fawn, though,  so I never think much of weird skin things every so often.

She eats grain free, salmon-based food called Victor, FYI."

They are also very fun and easy to train so whatever method gets used, owners tend to train Dobes in my experience to a higher degree than other dogs in general.  Unfortunately this probably incorrectly perpetuates the stigma these dogs are aggressive or dangerous, they are such incredibly lovable goofballs! Sure, their breed tends to be guarding, and they'll give you a bark, but after the 60 second notice they tend to give, they fall in love with people very fast! ... still people that don't know us clear the sidewalk 50ft ahead of me whenever I go on walks!"

I've read studies that have suggested that Dobes are likely to develop anxiety when searching for the little red dot. Further,  Some dogs move on to chasing other lights, and it is not pretty. Imagine you're out at night, and your dog sees a car's headlights and thinks ""Wow, look at that cool laser light thingy to chase!""

DobermanPinscher,37mmgo,jmullin09,3,Thu May 28 19:44:11 2015 UTC,does the whining seem like sickness? it's more geared toward anxious sickness support ... when our dobe whines it's usually excitement or annoyance

DobermanPinscher,37mmgo,krystin1134,2,Tue Jun 16 19:49:05 2015 UTC,"Our Dobe grew up in LA but relocated to Missouri when he was three.  Storms were a brand new thing for him.  The first night we had a real thunder storm he evacuated his bowels all over the floor and spent the rest of the night shaking in the corner both in fear and in shame.  It was a truly awful sight.  Out of sheer desperation we tried the ThunderShirt, thinking it was just probably a creature of advertising.  We couldn't have been more wrong.  It's like wrapping him in a thick, warm hug that makes him feel safe.  Three years later, if we get the Shirt on him before the storm, there are no problems.  Sure, there are some nights when we misjudge a weather pattern and don't get the shirt on him, but even then, he's now had the opportunity to realize that the storms won't hurt him, and all he does is come to the bedroom door and wake us so that he can sleep near us that night.  I honestly can't recommend the product highly enough."

He has his crate there with his food and water bowl. Even though he's twice the height of the baby gate, he's still scared of it since it fell on him once when he was itty bitty. He knows not to jump it. He knows when we say ""kitchen"" in the morning that he needs to go there and that we're leaving but will be back. I do put some treats in a kong as well so he knows it's not a punishment. He can have really bad anxiety at times too. But this routine each time we have to leave for work or go somewhere for a bit seems to work."

Like I said in my post, it's rare we're both gone. Even if we have an event  (like a family event) we're only gone a few hours, or he will stay and I will go home a couple of hours in because I don't want our pup by himself in the cage for too long.   We have plenty of Kong toys, which is what we use for treats both in and out of the cage. :)"

On our days off our baby dog gets to go to the park for an hour in the morning and an hour in the afternoon/evening. Sometimes he gets an extra noon-ish trip to the park, just because.

DobermanPinscher,37j15l,cjhilinski,2,Thu May 28 20:37:56 2015 UTC,"I have two of them. They have always been in their cages (aka kennels, to them) when we're not home. We've always fed them in their kennels and they always get a treat when they go in there. All I have to do is tell them where we're going, how long we expect to be gone, and remind them they can always call us on my cellphone if they really need something. I say ""kennel,"" and they go to their kennels (separate kennels side by side). I've asked the lady who lives above us if they are every noisy when we're gone and she says they are not. The kennels are never used when they do something wrong; it is always a neutral to good place for them.  Of course, they are spoiled beyond imagination. They sleep with me and have free run of the house when we're home. They are allowed to play a little in the house. It took a bit to get them used to being in the cages when they were babies, but giving them treats and their meals in there helped them get over that.  Now, keep in mind that I have two of them, and that can have a lot to do with keeping the anxiety down. They are never really alone.  So you could always double down on dobies...."

He doesn't mind the cage too much because he know he's going to get treats. Ironically, I've been eyeing a potential second dobie...   He's only cried a few times when he left, which is mostly because he wants to go with us. He'll be by the door waiting to go if he sees me get my shoes and sunglasses on. Even with two dobies, any times they've destroyed stuff while you were away? I'm concerned about ""double trouble"" honestly, Lol.   Edit: I should mention, we do have a cat.

Our breeder, also a licensed DVM advised against cage style, because pointy ears can get caught in the mesh.  He's never been destructive, and is actually very mindful of the kids toys versus his.  We have a half-glass side door and he will meet you at it while looking you in the eye.  Best security ever."

He got turned in at 8 weeks old and we took him home at 16 weeks old.  He was in pretty rough shape too.  Flees, tape worm and a hernia, not to mention constant diarea.    We brought him home, fixed him up and he is an absolute ball of love.  I can't beleive somebody gave him up, or that it took so long for him to find a home."

DobermanPinscher,379qr0,jourtney,1 point,Tue May 26 21:07:00 2015 UTC,Go on....We use an easy walk harness with mediocre results.  We have a doberman/shepherd that we've had since a pup and have been able to teach her awesome leash manners.  Our pure doberman is a bit hard headed on the leash...
DobermanPinscher,379qr0,jmullin09,2,Tue May 26 21:33:09 2015 UTC,"Haha I understand completely. I really like the Easy Walk harness, and the Sensation Harness (with a comfort flex band that goes under the armpits), but they don't work magic on their own. Training harnesses often need to be coupled with the use of high value treats!  On walks with younger dogs, I use strong motivators like cooked white meat chicken, hotdogs, cheese sticks, steak, cooked fish - all cut into tiny pea sized pieces. They only need a tiny taste to feel rewarded! Multiple treats in a row for any exceptional behaviors outdoors.  In order to motivate your puppy to pay attention to you (attention is the basis of all training. How can your puppy care about not yanking you around if they don't even care that you are holding the end of the leash?) you've got to be paying him. You wouldn't work for free, right? I wouldn't.  You can start indoors with attention work. If you're interested at all in clicker training (I'm huge on clicker training) grab a $2 clicker at the pet store. When indoors, work on the name-game. Name, click, treats. Name, click, treats. Do this with about 100-200 small treats for a day or two, and your dog will be a master at the name-game indoors.  Once your pup is awesome at the name-game (looking at you, coming right to you each time you happily say his name), try working on it in a low distraction area outdoors, like your yard. Name, click, treats, just basic stuff. After a couple of days, take it to the streets. Work on the name-game through all of your walks.  Once your pup is paying attention to you on your walks, start teaching him to pay attention for longer periods of time. Start indoors again. Name, pause, click, treat. The pause will slowly get longer and longer before you click and treat.  Each step needs to be taught from scratch outdoors. Dogs do not naturally generalize, so if they are taught attention work indoors, once they get outside, it's like they have no idea what their name is. It's all about taking it really slowly!"

DobermanPinscher,3707w2,Jamesb0nd,4,Sat May 23 17:26:00 2015 UTC,"not trying to rain on your parade, but most airlines will not fly dogs during extreme heat or extreme cold. texas in august usually qualifies as extreme heat.  after landing, your pup could spend a fair amount of time either waiting in the plane's cargo hold or waiting in a wearhouse-of-sorts, in 100+ degree temps.  in the spring or fall, maybe... in mid-summer,  i wouldn't consider it with either of my two.  (source: i live in dallas)"
DobermanPinscher,3707w2,zeroflexflyer,3,Sat May 23 22:44:58 2015 UTC,"I would STRONGLY advise against flying a dog in the cargo hold. I've heard so many horror stories as a licensed veterinary technician, from dogs getting lost, getting loose on the runway, dying of stress or severe dehydration, you name it. It is just so so stressful to put an animal in a confined box, shove them into a dark and confined space, and then subject them to all the noise and disorientation that a flight entails. Hell, flying is stressful for people when they know what's going on, can you imagine if you had no idea what was happening to you? We've also had many cases of pets coming off the plane fine physically, but never being the same behaviorally. So basically what I'm saying is, exhaust every option to transport him by car. Your dog will thank you!"

DobermanPinscher,36mk29,Blackops606,12,Wed May 20 14:08:27 2015 UTC,"Yes its normal.  That's how they look for a while.  The deep chest doesn't really start forming for a few months and until then they are mostly just big paws and long legs.  Those first few months are hilarious when you try to watch them figure out their fast growth.  At not even a year old, my current boy is still slipping up sometimes when he runs at full sprint and tries to turn or stop real quick.  When you go to see him, just look around at the other puppies and any possible grown adults you can.  Ask for paperwork too because even if he's very healthy and ready for a new home, it can be fun to look up their history and family tree."

DobermanPinscher,36mk29,afrael,5,Wed May 20 15:12:09 2015 UTC,"Were you able to learn about the parents? If the breeder will not show you the mother, or has both mom and dad on the premises, that's generally a red flag for the quality of the dogs, no matter what breed they are."

DobermanPinscher,36mk29,Blondeambitchion,6,Wed May 20 14:22:54 2015 UTC,"Both are gorgeous! I would be weary though since having mom and dad both is not a common practice, and can result in inbreeding if the breeder cares more about quantity than quality. Look into how many dogs they have, how many nests they have in a year, and whether the parents are tested for common health problems.   Were you able to visit the location where the dogs where born? Or did the breeder offer to bring the pup to you? Did the breeder ask you a bunch of questions to see if you were a good prospective dog owner? I personally wouldn't buy a dog from someone who wouldn't let me see the premises or interview me.  Did the pup FEEL chubby or just look it? Did the breeder say something about how they feed the pups and how they react to food? Does your pup look noticably different from the other pups in the nest? Pups will look weird at some stages, you can't really tell how they will grow out, but asking lots of questions and checking into the quality of the breeder will help you a lot."

DobermanPinscher,36mk29,dragon-pet,2,Wed May 20 14:56:58 2015 UTC,"I would not buy a dog from this person They are very obviously a back yard breeder  If you do consider it, look at their pedigree. If they don't know it or won't provide it, leave. If they do, look at health testing. This is not ""oh they are healthy"" This is specific for different breeds of dog For dobermans you are looking at Holter monitors (and date and cause of grandparents and great grand parents death) - get an idea of DCM risks  You are looking for hips and eyes clear for multiple generations and certified. A pedigree with multiple generations clear of wobblers.  If the pedigree is any Z factored dogs, run. (Dogs will have a Z before their registration number)   Vwd status of both parents; if the parents were bred carrier x affected (bad) or affected x affected (worse)  I can tell you with confidence that your ""breeder"" will not be able to produce most of, if any evidence of the things I just listed I wouldn't even be surprised if they didn't know much about most of it  So, read up about Doberman health issues so that YOU know and know what to ask and look for.  Remember that you are not saving the dog by giving a back yard greeder your money, you are funding their their business and encouraging them to keep doing it.  If you choose to buy, please buy from a responsible breeder.   EDIT: thanks for the down vote for pointing out that this looks like a back yard breeder and telling op what to look for. I guess I should have gone with ""aw yay puppy"" eyeroll  OP do your research before making any decisions, don't take my word for it. The Internet is your friend"
DobermanPinscher,36mk29,solbrothers,2,Wed May 20 21:24:24 2015 UTC,As I intend to be getting a doberman one day can I ask what warning signs tell you this is a backyard breeder? Obviously I know to look into health testing and paperwork but what was it on this thread that flagged up issues? I want to be as informed as possible.
DobermanPinscher,36mk29,UhCrunch,4,Wed May 20 23:03:02 2015 UTC,"They own both dogs Female looks like a total miss on conformation Head shape, markings, etc Male looks too tall (might be the stance) but doesn't look like breeding quality Puppies on hand. Most quality breeders have pups reserved before they are even born.   Good breeders don't breed pet quality dogs, they don't slap two dogs together because they have them on hand. They breed to better the breed.  That means the dog should be a prime specimen of the breed. They take into consideration their conformation, temperament and health and select a good match to produce puppies that look and act like dobermans and don't drop dead at 5 years old.   Just looking at the parents would be enough of a no go for me, but like I said. I'll bet my bottom dollar that they don't health test either. Would be genuinely surprised if they sold on breeding contract too.   Sorry but I've never seen dobermans in a show or from a quality breeder that look like that and the odds that the breeder happens to own two quality dogs and has puppies sitting around waiting to be sold is pretty close to impossible"
DobermanPinscher,36mk29,thebossapplesauce,2,Thu May 21 01:12:47 2015 UTC,"Everything here.  Please read OP and really consider.  My boy is a rescue from a BYB, and not knowing his lineage leaves a lot to his future that is unknown and that's scary with all the health problems Dobes are prone to.  I know it feels like this one purchase of this one puppy is like a drop in the bucket against BYBs, and that someone else is gonna buy it anyway, but you have to live with that dog for the rest of its life and without proper breeding practices, this pup could be a ticking time bomb.    My boy is 2, doesn't have any heart problems ATM, but I am mentally prepared for the day he may just drop dead from DCM.  Do you want a dog with that kind of uncertainty over their whole life?"

DobermanPinscher,35ibjs,awothe122,3,Sun May 10 17:34:14 2015 UTC,"My dobe is nearly 5 years old. He requires a fair bit of exercise, at minimum 1 hour per day or he will become whiny and pesty. I generally walk my dog 3 miles in the morning and 3 miles at night - this is our routine and deviating from it is hard for my dog to understand. During the day he is a couch potato, but he is always ready to go out, but not bouncing off the walls neurotic.  When he was a puppy (until 3 years old) he needed lots of play time so I arranged as many puppy play dates as I could with other larger breed puppy owners to both socialize and wear him out. In my experience border collies are more independent, dobe dogs need to be with their pack/people. I can leave my dog alone for 4 or 5 hours in the middle of the day and have no problems, but I prefer to bring him with me or have a family member watch him. Take the time to train your dobe, bond with your dog, then train some more and you will have the best dog ever! Every dog is different, dobies need activity and they love to play with people and other dogs, in my experience they are more capable of relaxing and taking time to not work where border collies are always on and intent on working. Keep in mind traits bred into BC's are much different than dobies - but they still dictate limitations/behaviors of each breed as much as or more than training will.  Any dog left alone will find mischief - training(of both human and dog) can reduce the amount of mischief dogs get into.   One of my neighbors purchased a pair of dobies without understanding their needs for training, socialization and to be with their people - I feel like he screwed up what could have been two fine family members because he did not realize the time commitment required to teach a dog how to be a good member of society."

I don't mind working with my dog for most of the day, but I do want some downtime to watch a program or sit at least.

DobermanPinscher,34isni,newdobeah,6,Fri May 1 14:45:36 2015 UTC,"Biggest advice I can give is to crate train. I got Bruce at 8 weeks old just a year ago and he absolutely loves his crate now and I can't imagine having him without it.  We ended up going with the Kong crate in the XL size. It has a divider that you can put in it to adjust the size while your pup is small. You want the crate to be just big enough for your pup to stand and turn around. Any bigger and they will feel free to pee in one corner and sleep in another corner.  Make the crate always be a good experience, it should never ever be a timeout place.  We fed Bruce in his crate and then closed the door on him while he was eating. Then waited for him to finish and rest. This is key to potty training because a young pup wants to go to the bathroom right after eating or drinking. But the key is to keep them in the crate so that they will want to hold it. Start with only a couple mins in the crate after eating and gradually increase. Always take your pup out to potty immediately after exiting the crate and praise for going to the bathroom.   This will quickly become habit for the pup and you are well on your way to a fully potty trained dobie.  For toys/treats, we have found that bully sticks are his favorite and plastic toys that he can chew on without chewing through. Toys like the kong type material.  Personally, we got Bruce for the purpose of being a happy go lucky family dog and very much wanted him to be friendly to everyone person or dog that he meets. From the day we got him, we introduced him to every possible situation we could think of. Strangers coming in and out of the house and giving him affection so that he trusts people, and bringing him to safe dog playtime scenarios. Please socialize your pup while he or she is young! Also, we would bring him to every pet friendly store or restaurant that we went to. He is now scared of nothing and loves everybody.   The absolute biggest advice that I can give is to please be VERY PATIENT. You are in for some trouble and accidents. This happens to everyone and is part of the learning process. Keep up with discipline and affection and you will have a well behaved best friend for many years to come. :)  Here is an album of some pics I could find on my phone: http://imgur.com/a/K1NEU"

DobermanPinscher,34c7md,solbrothers,4,Thu Apr 30 00:00:04 2015 UTC,"Mine was $1200. That was without the ear crop as I had a different vet I wanted to use for it than who the breeder was going to use. He had all but the last of his shots, all his initial deworming meds, and all the typical testing done.  I will definitely get downvoted for this but if you have the time to properly care for a puppy I'd definitely get one from a responsible breeder over getting one from a shelter. Every shelter dog I've had has been a nightmare to train and do away with any bad habits it's picked up. I just find it a lot easier to prevent bad habits and rude behavior from developing. That said, I've never had a dobie from a shelter and some people find their dream dogs there."
DobermanPinscher,34c7md,00z28,1 point,Thu Apr 30 11:22:32 2015 UTC,"This is what my boss has been telling me. He says since I have the money, why would I get a ""used"" dog? Plus having a puppy is half of the fun. I'm sure there's nothing wrong with getting a 2-6 year old shelter dog, but I want a cute baby doggy to cuddle with for a while :P"
DobermanPinscher,34c7md,00z28,2,Thu Apr 30 12:12:26 2015 UTC,"Well for a dobie...they are cute and love to cuddle. They really aren't super great to live with until about a year old. LOTS and LOTS of energy.  They're awesome as puppies but puppies are whiny assholes. No one would put up with their shit if they weren't so cute.   It helps if you get started with basic obediance training early.  And I definitely don't see shelter dogs as ""used"" dogs. I've just found they aren't a great fit for me usually. There are definitely pros and cons to both. And for anyone that wants to I fully support and encourage them to get a dog from a shelter, it's just not for everyone in my opinioin."
DobermanPinscher,34c7md,Swarleymon,6,Thu Apr 30 12:24:04 2015 UTC,"Be patient and keep an eye on petfinder.com. You will eventually find a purebred dobie that needs a home. Probably no papers, but since you won't be showing or breeding anyway, that shouldn't be an issue. Dobies seem to be especially sensitive, so time in a shelter is really stressful for them -- one that needs a home will greatly appreciate it. Adoption fees will still run around $200, maybe more for a puppy."
DobermanPinscher,34c7md,Swarleymon,2,Thu Apr 30 02:30:14 2015 UTC,"In my area, adoption fees are generally $350-400. I'm also weary about getting a shelter dog because you really don't know what you're getting. My parents were told by the shelter that the dog was a Belgian shepherd. Turns out it's a labradoodle. She's a great dog but it isn't what was advertised.   I really appreciate your help.  https://www.petfinder.com/petdetail/30911265/  I mean this is the closest dobie to me and it's over 300 miles away roundtrip"
DobermanPinscher,34c7md,drapethecrepe,3,Thu Apr 30 02:33:34 2015 UTC,"I've adopted from petfinder and my particular shelter I got my pup from paid for majority of his bills. I adopted him for $250, I got free neutering, microchip, first pet visit was free, (including meds since he had kennel cough and parasites in his poo) a free leash and collar, and shirt. If you add just alone the neutering and microchip that was around the price of my puppy. (Neutering is around $190 and the chip alone is like $60-80) So really you are not paying that much for a dog if you get one off of petfinder, but not all shelters are the same so just ask what's included with adoption. And if you can't find one close by maybe look into a rescue only for doberman, I know they have them for min pins. Oh and most places you adopt from want you to live within like 100 miles or less just incase something happens. Hope this helps."
DobermanPinscher,34c7md,UEMcGill,2,Thu Apr 30 04:07:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your help. Yeah, I'm in the SF Bay Area so there's a couple breeders around here. I will look into dobie rescues as well."
DobermanPinscher,34c7md,audriquill,2,Thu Apr 30 04:10:57 2015 UTC,"I understand breeders over charge for their dogs, my second dog a purebred min pin. His mom and dad were both champion show dogs and they were there on the spot. (And the puppies were even tattooed to number each pup) This was in 1995 and even back then we paid $800 for him, he wasn't the best dog but he was mine for 17 years. But honestly if doesn't matter if you get them from a breeder or a shelter you will still end up with an amazing companion. But having the experience of actually saving a dog is amazing, the fact that this dog needs me, or that I saved him from death or a far worse life makes me feel alot better."
DobermanPinscher,34c7md,ohhrissa,3,Thu Apr 30 04:17:12 2015 UTC,Yeah true that. That's how I feel about our rescue dog. She's really great. I feel like she's awesome and dependable but she's a late 90s honda civic. A good car but now I want a Corvette.

She is doing incredibly well on this diet! Poops went from large, semi-soft stinkers to small, firm, dark coloured poops that smell much less. She's actually able to digest the food I'm giving her. The only farts she does now are these little comedy squeakers that thankfully don't smell, not like the rancid, room-clearing aroma-terrorism from a few months ago. Jesus they were bad.  The extra effort to prepare her food is more than worth it. Dogs need real food!"

DobermanPinscher,31jikh,RockThisLife,2,Sun Apr 12 10:13:02 2015 UTC,Thank you! A lot of people didn't want to adopt him because of his chest (and his natural tail) and so he stayed at the rescue for months before we snatched him up. I love his chest though! I call it his birth mark :) I'd love to see your girl!

DobermanPinscher,31isky,audriquill,1 point,Sun Apr 5 18:19:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I can't wait to get her home. I've always preferred adoption over purchasing from a breeder. The pets always seem to develop a closer bond with their human companions when adopted. It's not always the case but seems quite common.   The only downside to adoption is that in my area, it can be a lengthy process involving multiple home visits if working with more than one organization. I think it would have been quicker/easier to adopt a child. However, I understand why as it greatly reduces the amount of returned pets to the shelter."
DobermanPinscher,31isky,audriquill,2,Sun Apr 5 23:43:15 2015 UTC,"I got my dobe from a doberman rescue, and it was a lengthy process indeed. It's so worth the wait and the work you have to put in though! Shadow has totally come out of his shell and is just the best, most loving dog I ever could have asked for. The first night he was home he laid down on the couch with me and fell asleep with his head in my lap... it was over for me from there, my heart just melted. I promise you, you're making the best decision bringing a doberman into your home. I'm so excited for you!"

He just sleeps and looks out the window. He's never shredded furniture or anything so I can trust him alone pretty much with no issue. I've found dropping a kong stuffed with treats and peanut butter then frozen is a good way of giving him a bit of stimulation while I'm out and combating any separation anxiety that might come up. Even then, I think he just conks out in the sun anyway."
