SonicTheHedgehog,3e4v2b,AdamRBi,5,Tue Jul 21 23:42:44 2015 UTC,"I speed run. And I prefer faster twitch sonic over the slower games such as lost world or Adv1/2.   Sonic generation did a great job imo of having multiple pathways and exploration for those who think outside the box in terms of just running forward. It has a certain way of making it possible to make jumps with precise timing.   For example, in Modern Chemical Plant, the two other blue pipes at the beginning are solid and lead to other areas you can see but not reach by just going forward. And at the end of the left most pipe, there are a series of precise jumps with a light dash trail and red ring at the end that skips a good portion of the beginning of the level if you find the path and can time your jump and momentum correctly.   I feel like lost world and boom were steps backwards from Generations.   In the future, I'd like to see a game that has the best of Generations and boom, if that's possible.   Also, I prefer 3D areas for modern sonic with boost. 2D areas don't feel very fun with him.  I will admit, that the 2d side of modern sonic is lack luster compared to the original Genesis/CD games, but it's 3D gameplay is much more exciting and well designed than Adv1/2/06.  As for a new game, I'd prefer if they'd build something that makes fast platforming fun and not dull, building the level design around the boost mechanic and physics  of modern sonic, similar to how they handled lt in generation but better"
SonicTheHedgehog,3e4v2b,rriillyy,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:29:37 2015 UTC,"I like both. That's why I like Adventure AND Generations so much. I honestly would like them to try the boost mechanic in another game with more unique levels. I feel like there's still potential in that system.   Edit: but at the same time, I kinda want them to try and flesh out the mechanics introduced in Lost World, as they have potential, but were burdened by bad/bland level design."
SonicTheHedgehog,3e4v2b,kodykid168,1 point,Wed Jul 22 09:03:56 2015 UTC,"Sonic is not about just speed. I've always maintained that a Sonic game should be a mix between speed, platforming, and exploration: you could just go through the level as fast as possible, but you'd be missing out on tons of secrets. And, if you take the time to learn the game and hone your abilities, the game will reward you for it. Not only that, the levels should accomodate for the different playing styles, which is something I feel SA1/DX fell short on, and what SA2/:B did perfectly. Heroes tried it, but the fact that a lot of times it felt like switching between the styles was mandatory, which bogged the game down: I would rather have a level that can be completed with either, some would be mandatory for the sake of learning them for future use (let's say you have a level with Sonic and Tails, then Tails and Knuckles, then just Knuckles - never all three at once (until the final boss during the Last Story, of course))."
SonicTheHedgehog,3e3vku,KoKuTanLuFi,8,Tue Jul 21 19:26:15 2015 UTC,"His strength is the main trait that Knuckles has. In the games, he can bust down walls through mere contact that Sonic's spin dash can't touch. He can also glide, stick to walls, and climb them with relative ease. In the 3D games he can scale walls that arch back towards him (incredibly tough to do! Try it once on a climbing wall). This might just be a magical trait tied to his being Guardian of the Master Emerald, but he alone can shatter it into pieces.  In various mediums he also has incredible fighting in hand to hand combat. Archie Comics 268-271 saw him fight in a combat ring. He took down Bark in an incredible hand to hand fight that was watched by most of the Sonic Universe, including Shadow/Rouge/ and the Eggman Empire During the Megaman crossover Worlds Collide he punched open the Egg Carrier with Wily and Eggman inside frantically trying to reroute power to delay him. In every video game for the advance series and the heroes game, he's assigned ""Power"" and has wicked punching moves.  Edit: got off track about other parts of Knuckles besides his strength.... sorry  Double Edit: Super Sonic is Invincible except for that time Knuckles gave him such a powerful uppercut that it knocked the emeralds out of him (at the start of sonic 3)(also referenced in the comic during the fight)"

SonicTheHedgehog,3e4e66,StandupGaming,4,Tue Jul 21 21:37:43 2015 UTC,"I think we will see more of them, but when people buy a Sonic game they typically want to play, you know, as Sonic. This was a main gripe with the Adventure Series, and one of the many for Sonic 06 (if people were actually playing it long enough, that is). Its got Sonic in the title, and we play as him less than 20% of the time. Having forced Tails/Knuckles scenes seem to bring the game(s) down, but having them as options to Sonic (or to tail along lol punz) makes them sort of an added bonus.  Tails and Knuckles, if used correctly, can add backstory and a sense of exploration to a Sonic game. I mean, hide some cool pickups on a high ledge, tell me someone here wont get tails and fly up there. Or hey, there is a whole nother part to this level but you need someone to punch a hole in this wall. Optional bosses that can only be reached this way? Huzzah! People lost their shit for S3&K precisely because you could now play as Knuckles in Sonic 3 and could bring Tails along to S&K.  Maybe they dont know how to add them back in without breaking it, true, but those two were added in the series back at the beginning. Its almost heresy to try to exclude both of them, especially tails, from any Sonic based medium now."

SonicTheHedgehog,3dx8g8,65kerensky,6,Mon Jul 20 07:52:37 2015 UTC,"There's pretty easy strategies to get A ranks in normal levels, they're very simple:  Sonic/Shadow: Just get through the level as quickly as possible while still getting as many points as possible. You'll eventually find a route that's both efficient time-wise and that gives good points. Gold Beetles are nearly mandatory.  Tails/Eggman - Get the highest number of lockons possible at a time - unless it's more than you would need for the maximum amount of points (20000). Pretty simple, it's just a matter of finding the spots where you should be trying to target mass numbers of enemies for points.  Knuckles/Rouge - Largely RNG. You can afford a hint or two if you're fast, but generally you're going to be flying around the level quickly, watching the radar, and trying to find the emeralds as fast as you can. It helps if you get used to some of the possible positions the emeralds can be in. Be prepared for a lot of resets.  As for the things like Chao and 100 rings missions, those are always just time-based, so speedrun them. Hard mode for Knuckles/Rouge is easy because the emeralds have preset, unchanging positions. Not much more to say about that, really.  Oh, and the driving levels take a ton of practice, but they're not as hard as they seem if you're careful, and if you get a Chaos Chao you're guaranteed to wipe the floor with the races/karate."

It helps if you get used to some of the possible positions the emeralds can be in. Be prepared for a lot of resets.   The best way to look at the Knuckles/Rouge stages is that: There are three/four distinct areas in each level, and there'll be an Emerald Shard in each of them (for example, in Pumpkin Hill, there's one Emerald Shard near Church Mountain, one around Ghost Train Mountain, and another around Pumpkin Mountain). Use this to your advantage, because you're far more likely to get a higher rank if you find the Emerald Shards out of sequence. Saying that; in all the times I've played SA2B, only once has there been more two Emerald Shards in the same ""area"" (which was in Pumpkin Hill on the PC version), so results may vary."
SonicTheHedgehog,3dx8g8,neohylanmay,2,Mon Jul 20 12:57:28 2015 UTC,"This has been my observations as well. There's three/four general ""sphere"" sub zones in each action stage and almost always the items to find are put in their own sub zone. So I sprint to each one, try to get radar lock, if not, sprint to the next zone. Aside from the first levels for Knuckles/Rouge, I generally do not get lucky and just 'find' an emerald out in the open while sprinting from zone to zone. Maybe my game's RNG is broken but two/all of my shards/emeralds/keys are buried almost all the time."
SonicTheHedgehog,3dx8g8,retro_paladin,3,Mon Jul 20 19:00:19 2015 UTC,"I have already beat all of Rouge's crap minus the Route 280 level   Even Mad Space? Rouge has some of the most frustrating levels, IMO, so if you already got those you are well on your way.  People here already gave you some good advice, but another thing I'd suggest is looking up whatever level on YouTube. There are pretty good videos there about how to get A ranks for each mission.   Also taking Chao Garden tips. My ""Chao Breeding program"" is on generation 4, and I have three Chao with only As, Ss, and a few Bs between them.   An all S-rank Chao isn't really needed to get the emblems (although I find them fun to breed). You could max out an all C-rank and still pretty much win. However, there are some tips:   Get Fusion's Chao Editor. Not to edit the Chao, but because it easily keeps track of your Chao's genetics. You can do the same thing with paper but it sucks. Chao breed using a system similar to real genetics. They have a ""hidden"" gene for each rank. This is why you sometimes get a crappy D-rank Chao when you breed two A-rank Chao. It's one reason why I keep track of both the visible rank and the hidden rank for breeding.  If you don't mind inbreeding, you can inbreed Chao to get ones with the same rank on their visible and hidden traits. This makes future breeding easier because you can get an A/A Chao instead of an A/D Chao"

Mad Space Speed Run cost me ~30 lives, no lie but I finally got it done.  Im on the gamecube version of SA2B so I use paper and pencil and sheets to keep track of my chao genetics.

Each and everyone of those videos show the best strats for tackling a hard level. Some are a bit hard, but almost all of them show the best route.  Here is a piece of trivia you may not know. Collecting every ring in a level results in an automatic A rank. Here's another piece of trivia. Collecting every lost animal in a level results in an automatic A rank. That's what the little numbers in the lower right mean when you collect one of them, a count of how many ""lost"" animals you found. Mind you, I didn't do any of those two methods once. (Also because some of the levels have miscounted rings).  My advice on the Rouge/Knuckles, imagine yourself as a giant sphere in a level. Knowing that, try to race along the walls of the level with just the edge of your sphere. This along with the other advice people have said already, you are able to cover tons of more ground this way. I also believe hint tvs lower your score (but don't count on that hint.)  For everything Chao Garden related: http://chao.hippotank.com/sa2b/ is the place to go. They have almost every bit of triva, stat, and location of every animal ever. Using that combined with the animal duplication glitch makes Chao Garden EASY work. My personal way of handling Chao stuff is getting the legendary animals and duping them as much as I can.

I was consistently stuck at B rank in mission 5 until I did the following:  Remember those on-rail sections? There's enemies everywhere and it becomes a shooting gallery. I find it incredibly effective to NOT try for the ""Perfect"" 11+ lock-on bonus. It only nets 2000 points. Instead, mash B and rotate the analog stick like crazy to destroy as much stuff as possible. You'll see your points skyrocket.  This only applies to the GameCube and later versions, since the A Rank requirement is 75,000 in normal and 100,000 in Hard (mission 5). Compare to the Dreamcast version which is 45,000 and 50,000 respectively."

SonicTheHedgehog,3dpeh2,technoguyx,2,Sat Jul 18 12:03:14 2015 UTC,"Link.  It's not that complicated from the looks of it; it seems most of his ""delicious chewy sustainy liquid tone"" comes from using the right amount of compression and from his amps' own particularities.

SonicTheHedgehog,3dm5z1,KFCNyanCat,2,Fri Jul 17 12:07:04 2015 UTC,I don't think Fighters deserves to be included with those other games. Its actually quite decent.
SonicTheHedgehog,3dm5z1,TheIVAce,2,Fri Jul 17 20:56:14 2015 UTC,"I don't get the hate for Sonic the Fighters. Sure, it's not a hardcore competitive fighting game, and the AI is easy (save for Metal Sonic,) but it's fun with friends."
SonicTheHedgehog,3dm5z1,Joshers744,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:33:05 2015 UTC,I'm that friend he mentioned.
SonicTheHedgehog,3dm5z1,retro_paladin,2,Sun Jul 19 19:07:25 2015 UTC,"Good list! I like your explanations too. Personally, I'd replace Colors with Sonic Adventure 2 (my top favorite Sonic game). Colors is good, I'm just not a huge fan of the direction the series has been going. Maybe some of it is just how Sonic seems to act a bit more like a jerk than he used to, and is getting cheesier (and I can usually handle cheesy). That and I don't feel like you can explore the way you could in games like Adventure 1 & 2.  Other than that, I'd probably put Sonic 3 & Knuckles instead of Sonic 2, but that one is still a great choice."
SonicTheHedgehog,3dm5z1,Joshers744,2,Fri Jul 17 14:55:24 2015 UTC,"I really liked Colors (music and levels were great), but like 90% of the game is 2D platforming. It does the 2D platforming well and it's a lot of fun, but modern Sonic in Generations had much better levels IMO.  Oh and the writing was horrible, even by Sonic standards."
SonicTheHedgehog,3dm5z1,retro_paladin,2,Fri Jul 17 16:36:53 2015 UTC,"I like the feel of Generations 2D Levels too. I feel like in Colors in the 2D parts, the jumping mechanics were a little off or something."
SonicTheHedgehog,3dm5z1,Joshers744,2,Fri Jul 17 17:43:01 2015 UTC,"Colors struck me as a much more precise platformer than the other Sonic games. There were a lot of levels where you needed to jump on a bunch of specific, tiny platforms. It was a bit wonky for sure.   I did like how it was a bit harder to obtain boost. It cut down on the ""push X to win"" thing. I feel like level designs of Generations and amount of content/boost of Colors would be about perfect."
SonicTheHedgehog,3dm5z1,chuckthedamnduck,3,Fri Jul 17 17:54:29 2015 UTC,I've always had mixed feelings on the whole boost mechanic anyway really. I guess I just really liked how it felt like I had more control of my character in the Adventure games. The Genesis games and the Sonic Advance games I think felt great too.

SonicTheHedgehog,3dm5z1,KFCNyanCat,2,Sat Jul 18 00:03:59 2015 UTC,"Sonic Adventure 2 is my favorite as well, but I think that it's just because of the childhood nostalgia - not the game itself."
SonicTheHedgehog,3dm5z1,Cupcake247,2,Fri Jul 17 19:06:35 2015 UTC,"I know what you mean, I'm just not completely sure. It might be. I was a teenager playing this one, so it wasn't my first Sonic. Nostalgia probably is part of it though."
SonicTheHedgehog,3dhdjn,ChurchofHelixChoir,4,Thu Jul 16 07:50:27 2015 UTC,Very lovely. It's weird how well Sonic music and piano bar/jazz go together. That picture centre page is a work from Orioto at DeviantArt. He does some damn good Sonic-themed artwork.

SonicTheHedgehog,3dhdjn,alsoye,2,Thu Jul 16 18:40:40 2015 UTC,It reminds me of the slowed down jazzy version they have in Sonic Generations (in the collection room I think?).  West coast hip-hop and Sonic fusion? Yes please.

SonicTheHedgehog,3d8wag,UIUCstreetpass,5,Tue Jul 14 12:31:40 2015 UTC,"Agreed! I am liking the game quite a lot too. It's much better than Sonic Dash.  I think those characters will probably come in waves. I would bet we see Classic Sonic come back for the birthday next year. I agree, though, that the 6% completely sucks (It takes 30 spins to have a 85% chance of getting the character! That's 1,500 red rings!!) . Especially since getting those eggs from defeating Eggman takes forever and I'm not about to dump a ton of money into red rings. I'm hoarding every red ring I get in hopes that they'll eventually release Metal Sonic as playable, as hinted at from the APK data.  Also, is the game super buggy for anyone else? I have a two and a half year old Droid Razr M with Android 4.4.2, so I'm not expecting fantastic performance, but the game is unplayably slow sometimes and the item sprites don't load properly. I think I need to get a new phone anyway...  Finally, does anyone know what happens when you run out of missions? I thought there were 50 or so but I don't know what happens after that.."
SonicTheHedgehog,3d8wag,retro_paladin,2,Tue Jul 14 14:43:18 2015 UTC,I accidentally deleted my Sonic Runners app out of frustration and don't even want to think back on all the data I've lost... :'-(
SonicTheHedgehog,3d8wag,Spaghetti9001,2,Tue Jul 14 13:07:41 2015 UTC,"In terms of Knuckles (and any power type) being bad, I think it just takes some time getting used to the playstyle of that particular level type. Depending on my focus, power ups, and luck, I can get a score about the same as any other type. In fact, I only run power types on volcano levels because their gliding ability helps traversing them a lot easier. Although those levels definitely have a difficulty spike compared to the other types, it isn't as bad as you think. For reference, my current best score is a little over 2 million with Omega (power type in volcano level).  To get a high score, the three items I use are magnet, laser, and asteroid in that order. Then I basically hoard them until I get to max speed and then immediately use magnet, wait until I switch to my sub character and use laser and use asteroid after dying once after the respawn wisp is done. Not sure how effective that is, but it works for me.  I honestly really hate using the drill because even if it gives a huge multiplier to bonus score, I feel like it's impossible to pick anything up. It feels too inefficient to be useful. If you want distance and collecting stuff, use laser. If you want to pick stuff up and destroy everything else in your way, use asteroid."
SonicTheHedgehog,3d8wag,Herro10000,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:22:11 2015 UTC,"It's really not bad for a mobile game, and the music is so much better than something like this deserves. There's definitely some skill involved, despite literally having only control over jumps and the fact that, as a freemium game, tries to encourage you to spend real money for shortcuts.  I do wish it wasn't as repetitive, considering that you're really only going to play this 1-2 times a day on average. It gets a bit tiring playing the same stage multiple times in a row, even more so as you get further into the story and the requirements for advancing increase. An option to go back and play previous episodes would be appreciated.  And yeah, power stages suck. Knuckles and the like can't jump for shit over certain areas despite them being the recommended characters."
SonicTheHedgehog,3d8wag,Sea-Salt,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:33:54 2015 UTC,"The premium roulette is the worst way of handling character unlocks. Timed events with a 3% chance of getting the character, also requiring in-game resource grinding or IAP? Yeah, I'll pass.  Solid game nonetheless."
SonicTheHedgehog,3d8wag,Rockman_Legend,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:42:14 2015 UTC,"I feel like a lot of my failings can be chalked up to the game stuttering at exactly the wrong time and messing up my momentum. I hope they can make the game smoother soon.  Also, the special roulette gives you an increased chance of getting a character, I think, so if you're aching to get Rouge or Omega you should give that a go. I've managed to get the both of them, luckily enough.  Also, I'm kind of annoyed with the whole Facebook incentive. I'd really have preferred if they put Amy in a store for Red Star Rings or even in the roulette, but not somewhere where I'll never get her. It's so sad. Capitalism Killed Amy Rose. :("

It's bad enough that 06 was the absolute worst Sonic game of all time, with the pain still being felt today among the fans, but now they want to dig it back up into the public eye, so that the whole series can be shamed once more?"

SonicTheHedgehog,3ctyv7,thatnerdynerd,14,Fri Jul 10 19:27:03 2015 UTC,in their defense the fans allowed themselves to be shoveled shit time and time again  but in the fans defense Sega was ok with shoulveing them shit time and time again  it's nice to see they're owning up to their shit shoveling but  didn't they already do this once before? like when colours came out?

SonicTheHedgehog,3ctyv7,sorin255,0,Sat Jul 11 01:09:26 2015 UTC,"I'm not ""heated"", I'm completely bewildered. I don't understand how anyone can like this game. Sonic 06 is objectively one of the worst games ever created, it's like saying ""I enjoyed E.T. on the Atari despite its faults""  There's literally nothing but faults in that game. I'm completely bewildered that some people can be so delusional as to unironically like it. How can you find any redeeming qualities in it whatsoever? Did these people somehow magically get a different version of the game? Is there some other game called ""Sonic 06"" in another language or something? Because that's the only way this can make sense."
SonicTheHedgehog,3ctyv7,Pester_Stone,2,Sat Jul 11 06:39:25 2015 UTC,"Personally, I never enjoyed the game and I do think that, other than the music and graphics, there were nothing but faults (well... personally I didn't mind the story, but I'd still do a solid rewrite).. But I do think there was a lot of potential. Playing the mod for Sonic Generations, which is actually about as stable as Sonic Adventure, has highlighted some interesting level design that might have worked had the rest of the game actually worked, and Generations' physics engine really makes all the difference... And I will defend it on that.  The biggest problem is the terrible relationship between Sonic Team and Sega Corporate, Sega of America and Sega of Japan, Sonic Team's habit of being overly ambitious (which has been a thing since the Genesis games if you know the development history of Sonic 2 and Sonic 3), Sega Corporate's own habit of rushing everything, and working conditions that caused the suspicious departure of Yuji Naka a few months before the game was set to be released... Which makes me forgive the game, and sorta forgive Sonic team, but hate Sega with a burning passion (made worse with the development history of Sonic Boom that was highlighted in a couple TSSZ articles.)"

The whole franchise seems so all over the place that it's hard to take it seriously. While Sonic Boom was a commercial failure, I'm glad that it's getting another game because it gives Big Red Button a chance to refine their concept and do it better. Sega should do the same - instead of hopping from one train to the next, to the next to the next to the next, they should run with what they're doing for a bit longer, past the first game, to give what they're doing a real chance to shine before moving onto the next thing."

SonicTheHedgehog,3cni8r,The_SonicThrowaway,15,Thu Jul 9 07:35:22 2015 UTC,"First off, OP, don't be embarrassed that you like something! Some people think the Sonic fandom and franchise are a train wreck and the gaming media likes to trash Sonic for easy clicks. The thing is, you have to realize most of these people likely played the first 3 Sonic games as kids and then decided to throw a fit when the series later changed/still catered to a young audience. They don't even want to see the series succeed and practically hold their breath for a new failure. This is why everyone loved to make fun of Sonic Boom. Yes, Boom was bad, but why was it so noteworthy compared to all the other bad games? Because ""lol Sonic sux, amirite?"" is practically a meme at this point. You have to take these people for what they are -- people whose option matters literally not at all. They're also a smaller audience than you think. Most people really don't care either way.  Other fandoms all have their cringeworthy moments. Sonic in particular tends to attract a young audience. I don't think there's anything wrong with that though. All of that bad fan fiction was written by people who enjoyed writing and are often young. I remember when I was that young, so I try to cut these people some slack. They're just kids and they're just having fun. Again, the anti-Sonic bias likes to hone in on this, without realizing stuff like Pokemon or Doctor Who have awful fan fiction and fan characters too.   You should do what makes you happy. Who cares what the anti-Sonic crowd on the Internet thinks? As the saying goes, ""Those who care don't matter and those who matter don't care.""  As for your second point, I think you should develop your game! I honestly think you overestimate the legal ramifications. While technically a violation of copyright, no one is going to bother to enforce that on a small, fan-made game. Developing a game is fun, even if you and a small audiance are the only one to see it!"
SonicTheHedgehog,3cni8r,retro_paladin,5,Thu Jul 9 14:58:35 2015 UTC,"Agree all the way, like most issues, the bad side of the sonic fanbase gets overblown some to create internet clicks and ad revenue. The majority of fans are not overbearing assholes, but the ones that make are will sometimes be the only ones that make noise.  As a grown ass 30 yr old man i played sonic 2 when it came out. I gave up a trip to disney world to play that shit. spinball too! As an older fan, im happy when a game ships that isnt buggy. Sonic has shifted gears a lot since the first days, and most of it has been great (chao gardens, adorable characters, and right now i cant get enough generations. my kids are going to grow up on these games, executive father decision #1 Not all of us think sonic is total shit. Its one of the top ten franchises for a reason.  And op, publish your game anyways. Yea copyright and all that, but if you want to make video games for a living, youll need a solid portfolio... This needs to be in it! One good fan made game might be the difference in your career!!"
SonicTheHedgehog,3cni8r,65kerensky,2,Thu Jul 9 16:43:45 2015 UTC,I'm kinda embarrassed for liking Fire Emblem. The new game is introducing some of the most cringe-worthy features. You can rub on peoples faces to get them to like you. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXzEcwYs8Eo

I mean, granted, I wouldn't bring up some of the things I like as a conversation starter, but if someone asks, I'll unashamedly say that I am Certified Sonic Trash™. Granted I like sonic stuff semi-ironically (though the comics can be pretty baller).  Just do you, you know? If anyone makes fun of you for it then you can probably assume that they like something they're ashamed of, and they're projecting their own fears of ridicule onto you."

SonicTheHedgehog,3cni8r,maros128,2,Fri Jul 10 00:12:14 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about a stigma because you're really overestimating how much of it there is. Sonic is still a big part of popular culture in terms of video games, they release new Sonic games frequently compared to other series. I'm including spin-offs, even though I really want a new main series game, Sonic Lost World in 2013 wasn't that long ago. There wouldn't be so many Sonic games if Sonic appealed mostly to the types of people that you mentioned, so the massive amount of people that buy Sonic games completely debunks the ""Sonic fans are a bunch of fringe lunatics"" theory. Maybe the people who say that are still stuck in the Genesis/SNES debate. It's such a common tactic, instead of having actual reasons for why they think it's a bad series, that takes too much effort so they say ""______ series the fans all a bunch of ______"". It's not even worth thinking about."

I learned I could draw by drawing Sonic, before everything looked like kid drawings. But Sonic looked like Sonic! To this day, I have had a Dr Robotnik vanity plate I made at a previous job. Everyone knows I am a big Sonic fan. No one hassles me about it at all, not even those I work with that range from all ages. Sonic is my favorite, I even made my own game idea, where I was the bad guy! Creating a fan game can be some tricky stuff. There is plenty of free music out there, heck there is plenty of Sonic Music Artists out there that make great music, that if asked would be happy to let you use their works in a game. Sprites, honestly I doubt there will be a problem there either. Did Psyguy get into any trouble? I don't really know. And Sega won't come after you. Unless it is huge, I mean freakin huge! Whether it be the fan games you listed or even the Sonic Unleashed->Generations mod. Sega hasn't really intervened. We all played that Sonic break out styled game with the muscular Sonic girls right? RIGHT?! That was a little weird and Sega didn't take up any action to them. You're not trying to sell the game. I don't know what my point was supposed to be. Like everyone one said, you should not be embarrassed of something you like. It is always great to dream and think of knew ideas. I have a book filled with not just Sonic, but all kinds of other ideas that I will get to when I slowly gain the means to do them. So you should never give up. I don't dislike the Sonic fandom in any aspect. You can even see my history where I was in favor of those that have their own ""Sonic characters"" I am not really a fan of all the ""le Sanic"" stuff that keeps getting posted these two Sonic subs since we have such few quality posts as it is. But they are fans too and wanted to share what they may have enjoyed. PS: how were you going to make the game? Are you good at programming? Were you going to use an existing Sonic fan engine?"
SonicTheHedgehog,3cni8r,Ineedmorcowbell,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:51:09 2015 UTC,"Haha like I said before Im not really embarrased of being a Sonic fan, its just not something I would automatically admit to or bring up unless the subject comes up.   I was going to use Game Maker Pro to make the game. I an extremely new at programming but before I decided to scrap the game I was practicing on the daily. Months later I haven't practiced and i pretty much forgot everything. I really wanted to use Nefault1st Sol Engine. Mainly because the engine had all the hard work cut out for me, but another reason is because one of his games inspired me to make the game I created now.. or well at least the idea of it. But he's keeping his engine private so I would have either made my own engine from scratch or work off of Sonic Revival Engine...   I also want to add that the plate you made looks fucking awesome."

Everything else has been mediocre at worst. Unleashed, Colors, Generations, and Lost World are all very decent games. And the new Boom game is based on the previous 3DS' title's style, and not Rise of Lyric. It wasn't bad, though it gets lost in the shuffle and people just presume it's a port of the Wii U game.

Honestly, people make it out like the bright spot as really short, but it was basically started in late 2010, and went until late 2014 when boom rise of lyric came out.That's basically 4 good years.  It's not like stepping back up would be hard. The foundation is still there. People are acting like we are back at sonic 06. History exists so we don't repeat our mistakes!

Even if opinions are divided among the others, there's still a strong positive view on Heroes, Unleashed, Colors, Generations, and Lost World.

SonicTheHedgehog,3c813g,darkpivot,19,Mon Jul 6 02:01:34 2015 UTC,"As I said the last time the topic came up:   Probably Unleashed. Despite all the crap it gets with the werehog and everything, it's a pretty solid game. There's no glitches, the game looks friggin' gorgeous even today, and the daytime stages finally get 3D Sonic gameplay right, and the rest of the series has built upon what this introduced. You can really tell that Sonic Team wanted to make up for the previous game.   Adding onto that, it just had the shitty luck of being the game to follow up Sonic 06, so it was greeted with pessimism from the start."
SonicTheHedgehog,3c813g,Sea-Salt,3,Mon Jul 6 03:41:58 2015 UTC,"I gotta agree. I think it's main problems was not necessarily the Werehog gameplay itself, more that the fact that it's stages are so freaking long. If they were reduced from 15-20 minute levels down to 5-10 minute ones, it probably would have been a lot more well received.  There's something about the day stages in Unleashed that makes me love them even more than Generations. They just have more...soul, to them. Not to say Generations levels don't, I love that game, but there's just something about the feeling of those day levels that I just love, that isn't there in Generations. Maybe it's just me..."
SonicTheHedgehog,3c813g,MarvelousMagikarp,3,Mon Jul 6 14:39:24 2015 UTC,"Well, to be fair, Unleashed's representation in Generations was merely a taste of the worldly adventure of the former, seeing as how the latter was a highlight reel of the series' best. Rooftop Run is probably my favorite level in Generations, but I love Unleashed's atmosphere more with the various cities that act as hubs."
SonicTheHedgehog,3c813g,Sea-Salt,15,Mon Jul 6 14:56:05 2015 UTC,"Sonic Lost World. By far one of my favorite Sonic games, if not my #1. The music is great, the game colorful, the levels creative and extremely varying. I love being able to carve my own path through the levels."

SonicTheHedgehog,3c813g,Gre3kgeek,4,Sun Jul 5 19:48:18 2015 UTC,It wasn't very good. A game focusing on the aspect of running around and collecting stuff isn't very good for a speed based game.

SonicTheHedgehog,3c813g,MarvelousMagikarp,11,Mon Jul 6 00:28:00 2015 UTC,"Shadow the Hedgehog get's a lot more shit than it deserves.  The game-play is decent. Admittedly, Shadow is fairly slippery when moving, but the wide stages and the ability to stop in the air whens shooting makes it much easier to maneuver. Shadow moves fast, and the guns are fun as hell. People say they're ""out of place"", but they really aren't. Gamma had a gun in Adventure, Tails and Eggman had guns in Adventure 2, Omega had guns in Heroes. There's a precedent set. There were a lot of levels, and each level having multiple, often unique goals and ways of playing it was great.  Except Lost Impact and The Doom. Those are hands down the worst levels in any Sonic game ever. Fuck those levels with a barbed wire baseball bat.  People say the story is stupid and ridiculous, but I dunno. The argument could be made that it's far too serious for a Sonic game, but I enjoyed the more complex, more serious stories that the Adventure games had, for what they were. Shadow added a lot of lore to the universe, and the branching paths was a nice touch too.  It's not without flaws, obviously. The ""super edgy and dark"" theme fell pretty flat, the vehicles were hard to control, and like I said before, the gameplay could be a bit iffy before you get a hold on how it works.   But all in all, I think Shadow is a decent game. It's no shining gem of the franchise, certainly, but it's still pretty decent."

SonicTheHedgehog,3c813g,eclipsecannon,3,Sun Jul 5 23:25:32 2015 UTC,"I think a majority of the spin-off titles are fairly underrated.   The Storybook Series, Sonic Advance trilogy, Sonic Rush, and the Sonic Riders series, all come to mind. I think it's all because of poor controls, which I can understand with The Black Knight and Free Riders, but there are certain aspects I can appreciate with these titles, like: the story, the environments/graphics, and of course, the music."

SonicTheHedgehog,3c813g,Hot_Beef_Injection,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:14:06 2015 UTC,"I definitely enjoyed it more than Heroes, mostly due to the lack of nerfed characters, extremely kiddy dialogue (and people want to rag on Lost World...), and broken rail mechanics.  That being said, it is a pretty ridiculous game. It's almost as if it's a fanfic come to life, and you could almost treat it as a comedy as to how try-hard it gets with being dark and gritty. The endings where Shadow straight up kills Eggman with his bare hands are downright hilarious.  I did enjoy it for the most part, though. Well, except that Final Story part; fuck that segment with its overly-long level and tedious final boss fight."
SonicTheHedgehog,3c813g,baba_944,0,Mon Jul 6 15:01:48 2015 UTC,"I don't think having a heavy story is a bad thing at all. Why wouldn't Shadow kill Eggman with his bare hands? He just learned he is a robot and has no purpose in life. This wouldn't be a problem with Megaman, people just like to assume nothing cool or exciting can happen because it's a Sonic game. And I disagree, I think these characters are perfectly set up for some awesome stories, akin to SA2 and Shadow The Hedgehog. As for the game being edgy... it really wasn't. I don't think having guns makes the game edgy. It was darker because Shadow is moodier than Sonic. That's a given. But other than that, it was a cool, high speed adventure to kill the aliens and discover Shadow's past."

While it's in no way the best game out there, it's still pretty decent, and plays more like a traditional Sonic game. If the focus was more on running around instead of collecting items (as the upcoming sequel seems to be remedying), it might be held in higher regard.  But, it kinda gets stuck in the shadow of its big console brethren. It seems to have been forgotten for the most part, or people who don't know any better just assume it's a scaled-down version of RoL."

Also, gave me Sonic 1 on the go long before the DS version and that awesome 3DS version came along.  Sonic and the Black Knight - I originally avoided this one because of the bad press, then I rented it one night, and loved it. Possibly one of my favorite spin-offs.  Sonic Boom Rise of Lyric - just didn't find this one as bad as most made it out to be. If anything, it reminded me of some of the cartoon tie in games I've played and I liked the exploration aspect.

SonicTheHedgehog,3c813g,MarshManOriginal,-2,Mon Jul 6 00:29:13 2015 UTC,The final special stage in Rush is near impossible and the difficulty literally spikes from Easy to FCing Through The Fire and Flames on Expert in Guitar Hero III.

SonicTheHedgehog,3c813g,MarshManOriginal,1 point,Mon Jul 6 07:53:28 2015 UTC,"Allow me to reiterate then.  Special Stage 7 in Sonic Rush is harder than completing Jumpin' Jack Flash on Hard ROCK difficulty in Elite Beat Agents., and that is considered one of the hardest stages to complete, because on Sweatin' and Hard ROCK difficulty, one mistake can easily end your run and force you to start over from the beginning.  Hell, it's just as hard as the final stage of Osu Tatakae Ouendan 2 on Insane difficulty, and that game is basically the Japanese equivalent to Elite Beat Agents with more difficult levels and a J-pop soundtrack.  In comparison to all the previous special stages in both Sonic Rush and other Sonic games, it is one of the most unforgiving difficulty spikes I have ever experienced in a video game. And that's a shame because Sonic Rush is a decent Sonic game."

I don't play it often, but when I do I play for hours before I'm absolutely too exhausted to jump. Not handled well, but good for gamers who want some physical activity.  Shadow the Hedgehog - See my entire comment history. It's my favorite sonic game behind Generations, and that's only because Generations is 10/10 good."
SonicTheHedgehog,3c813g,Neapher,3,Sun Jul 5 23:14:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, see, free riders was trash because it never worked. I'll say that Riders and Zero Gravity were pretty decent, free riders was really nothing more than just a game thrown out for the kinect. There was no effort put into it."

SonicTheHedgehog,3c0iz0,RadDudesman,2,Fri Jul 3 18:19:05 2015 UTC,Yeah. The splinter group who revere 06 as the best game are just so wrong!
SonicTheHedgehog,3c0iz0,peda7,1 point,Sat Jul 4 10:27:45 2015 UTC,"Well, that's one reason. But I think OP was asking more about why the fanbase is considered so cringey."
SonicTheHedgehog,3c0iz0,Poppin__Fresh,9,Sat Jul 4 11:08:30 2015 UTC,"A lot of outsiders don't think Sonic games are good, the franchise has arguably devolved into quantity over quality recently, and almost no Sonic game is enjoyable until you practice and master them after all, so most people find it hard to believe anyone can like the series. What makes things worse is that Sonic characters are so cheesy and retro that it's nearly impossible for most people to take a Sonic fan seriously.  That with the toxic vocal minority, the infighting between all the subgroups on YouTube comment sections, the porn and terrible OCs and fan fictions, and yes, the journalist circlejerking and idiots all perfectly combine to form an incredibly negative public image.  I agree completely with you though, the Sonic fandom is relatively solid and civil, I've seen worse."
SonicTheHedgehog,3c0iz0,IamAnthonological,4,Sat Jul 4 12:45:20 2015 UTC,"You could also trace the entire thing back to 06's reception - there were ""naysayers"" within the fandom since the Dreamcast (Adventure 1 - Shadow) days, but nobody paid attention to them because for the most part, the games were good (OK, Shadow was pretty mixed in reception but it wasn't ultimately ""terrible"".. in my opinion at least). Then 06 happened and those same people were using it as a tool to retroactively condemn damn near everything that came before it; since 06, there hasn't been a single (main series) game in that similar style: 06 - fully 3D, multiple characters; Unleashed - 2.5D/on-rails, Sonic-only; Colours - 2.5D/on-rails, Sonic only; Generations - 2.5D/on-rails, Sonic only (..sort of); Lost World - 2.5D/on-rails, Sonic only. Heck, Project Needlemouse was a Sonic 1 clone (I know that that's its in-development codename, but it doesn't deserve the title ""Sonic 4"" in my opinion). It's like 1992 onwards never even happened.  I remember going on Sonic Stadium's forums in the wake of 06's release and pretty much 99% of the top Sonic-related posts were all along the lines about how ""Sonic 1 should be the standard again"". I still remember how people were going to boycott Super Smash Bros. Brawl, just because Sonic was going to be voiced by Jason Griffith and not Ryan Drummond (although I guess with Roger Craig Smith taking the reins, that argument's dead and buried). Stereotypically speaking, the Sonic fandom were seen as whiny and perpetually unsatisfied - oh, the new Sonic game has a bug? 06 HAS BUGS AND THEREFORE THIS GAME SUCKS. Sonic is not voiced by Ryan Drummond? He wasn't in 06, and therefore the game sucks. The game makes use of the Z-axis? You see where I'm going here.  Roger van der Weide put out a good video discussing 06 and its failure a little over a year ago, and I think he got everything on point."
SonicTheHedgehog,3c0iz0,neohylanmay,5,Sat Jul 4 14:59:27 2015 UTC,"Very good point. Sonic '06 would've been a major contributor to all of this in several ways, Sonic Boom is probably going to be a repeat of it. One way to think about it is that these Sonic '06 was the catalyst of a competition between ""Sonic should go back to his roots."" and ""Sonic should keep trying to get back to decent 3D gameplay."" Sonic Boom has also just recently reignited this issue.  Sega keep trying to satisfy both and make these 2.5D games with a Sonic 4 or a Sonic Boom here and there, but Sonic 4 and Sonic Boom both sucked for the most part and are rightfully rejected by the fans, meanwhile Sonic Generations succeeds with flying colours. This means Sega don't really learn anything and keep making weird half-assed crap, which only serves to make Sonic seem like a dead end franchise and to make the Sonic fanbase more and more frustrated. The resulting complaints and journalist circlejerking fuel the fire and hurt our reputation more and more."
SonicTheHedgehog,3c0iz0,IamAnthonological,3,Sat Jul 4 15:53:54 2015 UTC,"I've actually noticed that, much like 06 was used against Adventure-Era Sonic, Boom is actually being as a tool against Post-06 (or what I've been heard has been referred to as ""Legacy"") Sonic what with the writing being catered more towards younger, almost ""kid friendly"" audiences, as being shown on the SA3 Facebook page and TrueSonicSpirit YouTube channel (the latter of which Roger vdW actually does some videos for), almost in the exact same way. Whether or not I agree with what they're doing I can't really say; I follow both pages myself and personally would rather have a game written and play in the Adventure style over Post-06 (although saying that, I'm at least curious about Generations - admittedly, I was disappointed in the PC Demo, but it was going cheap during the Steam Summer Sale so I figured I might give give the full game a shot). Sure, Sonic's a series I've been playing since the MegaDrive days, but it was Adventure 2 that got me back into the series."
SonicTheHedgehog,3c0iz0,neohylanmay,2,Sat Jul 4 16:16:43 2015 UTC,I hate how porn is held against us when everything has rule 34 and fanfics. Everything.
SonicTheHedgehog,3c0iz0,runnerofshadows,13,Tue Jul 14 05:47:54 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's because those who have a negative influence are the ones who are most vocal and end up becoming the most well known (e.g. SCSF).  It's also partly because some of the sonic fanbase will openly defend the worst part of the franchise, which to many comes off as really fanboyish and in poor taste. (Liking a bad game isn't the issue, but a lot of people flat out won't acknowledge flaws in things)  There are a lot of great people in the fanbase, but honestly it's no wonder that it's viewed poorly despite that, as those outside of the fanbase probably never see that side of it."
SonicTheHedgehog,3c0iz0,ThatGuyfromNI,3,Fri Jul 3 17:52:10 2015 UTC,a lot of people flat out won't acknowledge flaws in things   I'm guilty of this in the case of Sonic Adventure.......

SonicTheHedgehog,3c0iz0,Sea-Salt,8,Fri Jul 3 17:57:46 2015 UTC,"You've just been lucky. Due to the changes in the series through the years, you have several generations who are used to one particular playstyle, with the more vocal ones complaining that the new games aren't like the ones they grew up with.  It's happened with the outspoken classic fans, it's currently happening with the Adventure kids, and I'm sure we'll be dealing with the ones ten years from now who started with Colors or Lost World. It's an ugly cycle.  The best thing you can so is ignore the toxic fans, and just enjoy what you can."
SonicTheHedgehog,3c0iz0,Sea-Salt,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:38:11 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I have seen this and while it isn't good, it's nothing that doesn't happen in other fanbases (Pokemon has Genwunners debating Hoennbabies and Kalosperm, Smash has Melee vs Brawl vs 3DS/WiiU,  Whovians have Classic vs Modern Dr. Who, et cetera.) I'd even admit to being an Adventure Kid. It's kind of natural when you have a franchise that lasts for more than five years."
SonicTheHedgehog,3c0iz0,Poppin__Fresh,3,Fri Jul 3 19:53:25 2015 UTC,"There's nothing wrong with liking the Adventure games (I love them, and I've been with this series since just about the beginning). But it's these people who throw around the ""True Sonic Spirit"" motto who act like their vision of how Sonic should be is the only one that matters, and who act as if the entire series started with SA1, and that's how it it was always meant to be, who piss me off with their elitism and overall asshole qualities towards anyone who suggests that the series can venture into multiple directions."
SonicTheHedgehog,3c0iz0,Victoryia,17,Sat Jul 4 17:05:52 2015 UTC,"As a recovering 'bad sonic fan' I can shed light on the real reason.  Sonic as a franchise is targeted at boys in the tweenage demographic. This is the point where a lot of boys either succeed at transitioning into young adulthood or fail. The ones that fail will get stuck in a phase of boy-manhood (also known as a manchild). This is where you get things like Chris-chan and the like; guys who failed to adapt mentally and socially to adulthood and instead doubled-down deeper in their prepubescent interests. For a lot of guys this is sonic.  That's where the stereotype of Sonic fans being autistic comes from, and is also why there's a disproportionately huge hentai following of the series.   It's all fairly interesting."
SonicTheHedgehog,3c0iz0,Victoryia,5,Sat Jul 4 01:11:35 2015 UTC,"looks at topic title.  Ahem. When it comes to the fanbase, it's pretty bad. It really is a bunch of kids with their recolors or adults with their fetishes & porn. It's so bad nowadays I don't want people knowing I like this series unless I have known them for awhile.  It's quite sad. To me, it's still a great series if you can ignore the fans. In all honesty, if you have been around the internet long enough or seen what I have seen, you will understand with time."

Now I agree, there are actually a lot of wonderful people in the Sonic fandom with admirable qualities and skills, who appreciate the positives of the franchise, do great things and are great people, which I cherish about it, but I think just like any fandom that quite heavily comprises young teenage boys (I'm 16 years old myself and quite mature for my age I'd like to think, so hopefully don't fall into that bracket :P), there's a highly vocal... I'd like to think minority that gives the whole gig bad press. You know the kind of people I'm talking about; the whiny fanboys, budding artists who should probably have their internet access privileges deferred until they're older for the good of DA, stubborn circlejerkers (and I have no problem with circlejerking in itself, I do it all the time, but some of these people that refuse to acknowledge anything...), elitist purists who can't see past the ends of their noses and think a particular element of the franchise is superior and everything else is crap, the downright ass-hats who always know best and people who bash things to the point you question what they're doing spending their time in a Sonic part of the internet... you get the picture. I don't mean to throw negative labels around but basically from what I've seen there's a lot of awesome that occurs in the fandom, it just sadly from the outside doesn't always seem like the best fandom due to the negative vocal minority, and bad rep and stereotypes that are resultantly perpetuated. If you wanna be a part of it, you've just got to wade through the tripe sometimes and get involved with the good stuff, and who cares what unenlightened outsiders may think of you."

SonicTheHedgehog,3c0iz0,NoonecanknowMiner,2,Sat Jul 4 03:24:37 2015 UTC,My biggest problem with the fan base are all the fan created characters that are pretty much a redesign of shadow with clothes on.  I know other fan bases have this too but it seems so prevalent in the sonic fan base.

While I do believe in the existence of exceptions to these stereotypes - hoping to be one myself - there is no denying the fact that there are many who take the stereotypes and run with them. I know from experience that sometimes the flak you get from telling someone you like a certain game in the Sonic The Hedgehog franchise can be received in real life, and not just on the Internet. Seriously, try telling a Classic-era purist (or pretty much any particularly vocal Sonic The Hedgehog 'fan') that you like Shadow The Hedgehog (the game) - it doesn't matter if it's on the Internet or IRL, you're guaranteed to cop it; but I digress. I have a friend (who most likely would have posted this Wall-o'-Text here on my behalf) who says that most of these haters don't even deserve to be called fans. I agree. Yes, it's fair if you don't like this little detail, or maybe two or three games, but don't be so freakin' vocal about it, for Chaos' sake! Maybe calmly make a small comment like, ""I'm not particularly fond of [x]"". Don't make a big deal out of it. It's not worth it, guys. Seriously. Why can't you just have fun?

The overarching trend seems to be that many fans have no concept of quality, which leads to defence of bad games, bad shows, bad comic issues.

SonicTheHedgehog,3bsmep,TheMightyMatador,10,Thu Jul 2 04:11:05 2015 UTC,"I'll give it a try!  Sonic 1: It's like the first meal you ever try at a restaurant. You don't know what to expect so you go with something simple.  Sonic 2: You liked what you had before and you want just a little more this time.  Sonic 3: It's the biggest meal on the menu, complete with dessert and side.  Sonic CD: I don't quite get this one. Oriental?(This is my all time favorite game so I would prefer it more as a double cheeseburger with bacon.)  Sonic Adventure: Things get spicy!  Sonic Adventure 2: Things get bigger, badder, and flaming hot spicy!  Sonic 06: Dog food would taste better.  Sonic Unleashed: One side is good! The other side is a tangled furburger.  Sonic Colors: Things are vibrant and sweet, but with enough meat to satisfy you.  Sonic Generations: Whole lotta everything! And everything is good!  Sonic Lost World: Simple, tastes good, but kind of leaves you empty.  Sonic Boom: Sonic 06 would taste better.  Sonic Advance: Makes you happy I assume from the Mtn Dew.  Sonic Rush: Pretty Sweet Game.  Sonic 4: Poorly made meal? I've never played this game.  Sonic Runners: Kids meal essentially, it's tasty and you get exactly what you paid for...which was nothing... you paid for nothing. Hooray! EDIT: Just noticed the hooks somehow. Anything extra will cost you."
SonicTheHedgehog,3bsmep,Numuruzero,2,Thu Jul 2 04:49:44 2015 UTC,"Heh, I like your explanations. I'd say Sonic CD is kind of trying a new meal but not ready to let go of what you know is good. You try a little oriental style and it turns out pretty good.  Sonic 4 is trying to recapture the feeling you got from the first meal you had, but the restaurant shut down and the new one doesn't quite get human food."

SonicTheHedgehog,3bsmep,TheMightyMatador,1 point,Fri Jul 3 09:51:55 2015 UTC,"Depends on your perspective. Some people like Spicy foods, others don't. Sonic Adventure came into full fledged 3D and brought on 6 new styles of gameplay, which did come with some criticism(Lookin' at you Big the Cat).   Sonic Adventure 2 brought it back down to three styles of gameplay, but gave every character their own unique set of levels, multiplayer, and the most important aspect, Chao Karate. Some people don't like spicy foods."

Some of the community had a real blast with it (see the top post on this sub, ""Upsanics to the left"", and /r/sonicgifs), made as much fun as they could, and moved on. At this point I feel like we should work on moving away from the negative steryotypes that come with a Sonic fan, and this cancer of a ""meme"" is the first to go in that process.

With the establishing goal of rescuing The Mega Man comic from low sales (they did, but it was canned anyways), the goal of re-establishing interest in a solo X comic (they failed) and the goal of saving Sonic Boom from irrellevancy (they tried), there's really not much meat to this event, and it ultimately leads to nowhere, so I guess they needed to hurry the action along to make the most of the time they got  A massive SEGA/Capcom crossover is the perfect popcorn flick event that makes fanbois happy, but I feel like this event would have been more meaningful if SEGA and CAPCOM had allowed Archie access to the respective multiverses of their characters instead of just two"

SonicTheHedgehog,3blf1d,65kerensky,5,Tue Jun 30 04:16:08 2015 UTC,I like redesigns. I hate original characters. Mostly because the vast number of them seem to be Shadow-Scourge love children so whenever I see one I just assume it is and go about my way.
SonicTheHedgehog,3blf1d,UsagiTaicho,6,Tue Jun 30 04:36:04 2015 UTC,"Yea there are no shortage of... ""original"" characters out there. Every breed/color of hedgehog fox and rabbit. Some are drawn really well, but others are just eye cringing"

SonicTheHedgehog,3blf1d,Sea-Salt,4,Wed Jul 1 00:21:48 2015 UTC,"As long as they're well done, I don't see any problem with it. Biggest issue is just people being lazy, either just recoloring an established character, or making them insanely powerful and having them make Sonic and the gang worthless.  I've got some ideas myself if I could get myself working on them, and quite a few of Archie's crew have done fanart and/or fanfics before they made it to the big leagues."
SonicTheHedgehog,3blf1d,DarkFlameSquirrel,2,Tue Jun 30 05:10:23 2015 UTC,"I'm mostly against original fan characters. The idea is pretty insane. I mean, there's a huge load of existing Sonic characters and people want to add more?"
SonicTheHedgehog,3blf1d,viceroyofmontecristo,2,Tue Jun 30 13:48:20 2015 UTC,"I really think that a large amount of this argument comes down to talent. A lot of what people consider ""recolors"" is actually young people getting their first real taste of the internet as a creative medium, and as such isn't really something that deserves to be greatly criticized and ridiculed. Granted, many people fond these kinds of things cringeworthy, but it's really the starting point of kids learning about arts (because we sure as Hell know America's school systems ain't where they're gonna learn about them).  One of the most important points to take from this is that, no matter what you think of people who create fancontent for ANY fanbase, no matter how cliche or generic it may be, if it be for Sonic or Homestuck or any other fandom, there's really no justifiable reason to laugh at people who make fancontent (of any quality) without looking like a massive dick  Granted, I've never considered myself creative enough to actually make any Fancharacters myself, but I know a lot of people who do, of all different types and qualities, and there's absolutely no reason to insult them for it. A lot of kids cut their artistic teeth creating fan characters, self-inserts, and ships for their favorite fictive works, and there's no reason to make fun of then for it. Nobody's born good at things, and everyone had to start somewhere.  So embrace fancharacters. Read every Mary Sue fanfic you can find. Scan DeviantArt for new drawings of questionably-proportioned dragons and foxes. Tell kids how cool their OC Darkedge the Shadow Recolor is. Because in the end, that's how people get good at these kinds of things."
SonicTheHedgehog,3blf1d,NoonecanknowMiner,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:34:19 2015 UTC,"I like redesigning characters. Fan Characters depend on what they are. If it's some shitty MS paint recolor, then fuck it. If it's actually original, I don't hate it. The only OC's I'm fine with being recolors are the ones that are related to a certain character, because, genealogically, it makes sense.   Fan Fictions, once again, depend on how they are written. Every now and then, I might come across a gem, but most aren't appealing to me. And lots are really poorly written or just stupid as a whole."

Just being drawn well won't impress me, you've gotta cover all your bases.  Same deal with fan fiction, if you write well, I'll enjoy it. Trying to break pre-established characters apart and put them in situations that don't make sense is kind of obnoxious (I'm talking to you shippers everyone.)  I'm all for it, keep doing it people."

One of the new rules is that he's no longer allowed to have a love interest. He's allowed to have girls fawning over him, but he can't have any more relationships, period. So both Sally and Amy (as well as every other girl in the comics) are disqualified.  Although I kinda like it because it means Amy can be more like her original game character; infatuated with Sonic but not able to seriously pursue him. Her character's personality has been kinda dull lately and the reboot has since invigorated her with new purpose and drive. I like the new Amy. She's not a whiny kid in the background anymore. She's now a seasoned freedom fighter, fighting alongside Sonic and holding her own without anyone treating her like a child. Cream and Cheese have taken over her old position of freedom-fighter-in-training.  And as much as I like Sally and Sonic together, things were just getting too complicated. It was hard to keep a relationship neutral without pushing into uncomfortable territories or breaking them up only to get them back together a million times over. Sally has enough problems leading a kingdom, the freedom fighters, and maintaining a relationship at the same time. With her father, the King, much younger and healthier in the reboot, and her relationship with Sonic wiped from existence, she can focus on being a strong leader and not on wrangling her boyfriend.  Oh, and thank god Geoffrey St. John is gone. That was one love triangle that infuriated me from start to finish. Apparently, the character of St. John was Pender's favorite creation, so they made sure to turn him into a bad guy right before the reboot blinked him out of existence. One last incredibly satisfying middle-finger to Penders."

SonicTheHedgehog,3bhn58,cobysev,3,Tue Jun 30 10:21:47 2015 UTC,What exactly was the scandal?
SonicTheHedgehog,3bhn58,100111000101,2,Sat Jul 4 07:16:58 2015 UTC,"TL;DR - Ken Penders, a writer/artist for Archie's Sonic comics, realized that Archie Comics hadn't made him sign legal paperwork making his creations their intellectual property. So he went and started copyrighting every Sonic character and storyline he ever created.  Out comes the Nintendo DS game, Sonic Chronicles: The Dark Brotherhood. Ken balked at the use of his ""Dark Legion"" in a video game without his permission (the Dark Brotherhood closely resembled the Dark Legion). So he sued.  Long story short, Ken won the rights to his own characters, since they were copyrighted in his name. And he would get full control over their future use in comics, as well as royalties for future use.  Archie Comics, however, were allowed to continue selling their old comics without paying Ken royalties. And to ensure they didn't pay him any royalties in the future, they rebooted the comics universe with the World's Collide Mega Man crossover, erasing any characters he created and ignoring any stories he wrote for the comics.  Also, Ken isn't allowed to use characters that resembles SEGA's intellectual property, in appearance or in story. So even though (for example) the Dark Legion belongs to him, he can't go create his own Echidna Dark Legion stories that take place in Sonic's world. So Ken is making his own comic now where the Dark Legion is rebranded as an alien race and look somewhat different from echidnas in Sonic comics.  And SEGA released a huge list of restrictions for Sonic's use in the comics, not only to make him closely resemble the video game Sonic, but also to ensure they have better control over his use in the future so this doesn't happen again.  Whew! That was a long TL;DR."

I didn't know that. That's weird. But I thought that since Amy was  created in the video games and still has a crush on Sonic there, that they could still run with the Amy-Sonic thing. I thought that since Sonic and Amy never really had a relationship in the comics pre-scandal it would be possible in the reboot. But I get why Sally/Sonic was shut down."
SonicTheHedgehog,3bhn58,Sea-Salt,3,Mon Jun 29 15:51:13 2015 UTC,"Amy can still (and does) show her attraction towards Sonic; unless we start seeing Sonic reciprocating in the games, though, it ain't happening in the comics.  Which I guess I can live with; I've always been a Sonic/Sally shipper."
SonicTheHedgehog,3bhn58,Sea-Salt,5,Tue Jun 30 00:45:32 2015 UTC,"Depends on the canon.  With the comics, I've always gone for Sonic and Sally, and they work well when not handled by Penders (see: the infamous slap). Sucks that they can't be together in the reboot because Sega, but I like to pretend they still do stuff in secret. If the Sky Patrol be a-rockin', don't come a-knockin'.  With the main games, nobody, really, since there's nothing to imply Sonic has the hots for anyone. Amy's too obsessive, and though a few hints have been thrown with Blaze, it looks like the blue blur is destined for the single's life.  Boom is the only canon where I could see Sonic/Amy working. There's some indication that the two have gone on dates, and we do see them hanging out alone often enough. At the very least, it's refreshing to see Amy's crush be secret, and that every other sentence out of her mouth isn't about wanting to bone Sonic."

SonicTheHedgehog,3bhn58,Cadenreigns,5,Sun Jul 5 17:29:09 2015 UTC,Sally's not even canon. Amy it is.
SonicTheHedgehog,3bhn58,Cadenreigns,4,Mon Jun 29 12:10:20 2015 UTC,"considering everything in the comics has to be signed off by sega, she is canon in a sense. She, as well as some of the other original freedom fighters, did actually appear in sonic spinball, so she's canon in that sense as well. Add the fact that she didn't stay dead after the endgame series because sega was considering bring some of the archie writing to the games (which they should still do), and you have 3 reasons why she might as well be considered canon."
SonicTheHedgehog,3bhn58,spanieldaniel,2,Mon Jun 29 13:51:45 2015 UTC,"I watched too much SatAM as a child and have collected too many of the comics to ever be for anyone other than Sally. So it annoys me a little that there's been a few more nudges towards the Amy side since the genesis wave, which is probably another result of the Penders fiasco and the comic having to stay closer to the games so that such a dick move cant be pulled again. That being said, Archie has made Amy a bit better since the reboot (and Archie's Amy has been better than game Amy for a long time anyway).  All in all with the cross over and the gaia storyline in progress I wouldn't expect much development from either relationship for a while yet."

SonicTheHedgehog,3bhn58,65kerensky,5,Mon Jun 29 09:01:19 2015 UTC,Would you... care to do that?
SonicTheHedgehog,3bhn58,TheFlamingPotato,6,Mon Jun 29 09:57:04 2015 UTC,"As it was 5 AM on my phone when I posted, I now have the clarity to elaborate.  Lets start with why SonAmy is shit. Sonic is 6 years older than Amy, which when you both are teenagers is a really big deal. This is roughly equivalent to someone who just graduated out of elementary school dating someone who is on the verge of leaving high school. Even where I’m from (Kentucky, USA) that sort of thing is creepy to the max.  But lets say that the age difference doesnt matter. Those two just seem right together amirite? Pink and Blue hedgehogs and over 9000 babies!! No. Sonic frequently categorizes being alone with Amy as a punishment. Example one of many: Bunnies wedding, he's asked to keep the flower girl Amy happy, and Rosie, Bunnie and Sally all think it’s hilarious to punish Sonic that way and laugh about it. A dozen issues later Sonic and Amy are preparing to invade Moebius after Scourge took Freedom HQ. Sonic's reaction to Sally pairing him with Amy? ""You're Cruel"". Play Sonic Advance 3 and look at Sonic's face when you select Amy as his sidekick. Sonic just doesnt want to be the subject of Amy's affection, and he as well as everyone around him use Amy's obsession to punish him. Its practically an unspoken franchise-wide running gag.  How do you think that should make Amy feel? To know the one person you like more than anything thinks you're a punishment? The one guy that you moved across the planet to be closer to? Im sure more than one guy/girl reading this can think back to a point in their lives where they had a crush on someone way out of their league and people teased them for it. Amy handles all this in probably the most mature way possible btw, stating that it motivates her to become the greatest freedom fighter ever... so that Sonic would have to choose her (Training with Julie-Su in StH 172). In fact there is so little else to Amy's backstory that the only thing that comes to mind when we think of Amy is ""Sonic's self appointed girlfriend""  And just think! The biggest thing about your character is a big damn joke to everyone else around you! I am surprised, some days, that Amy is even a freedom fighter at all... I like that the new continuity and Sonic Boom, however much longer it lasts, have toned down the stalker Amy quite a bit, but seriously people, one sided relationships suck  Even if Sonic did give Amy a chance... wait for it... she would probably discover he sucks and dump him. The phrase ""be careful what you wish for"" is appropriate here. Amy has spent so much time seeking Sonic that even if she were to finally get him, the level of hype could easily fall flat. Ive seen similar happen time and again from my friends. One guy chased this girl for literally 7 years, waiting for her ""to finally notice him."" She relents and they start dating. Two months later he angrily dumps her, upset that he wasted so much time. I suspect something very similar would happen if Amy and Sonic dated. Amy can stand toe to toe with foes that literally crush everyone else The Iron King for example and in the new continuity she gets to learn the exclusive Mystic melody. Amy is a strong freedom fighter on her own, she doesnt need Sonic's approval to motivate her anymore, if anything someone should be chasing her! And if she does find someone else, anyone else, maybe they would actually enjoy being with her!  TLDR: Amy deserves better than Sonic. SonAmy is practically a slap to Amy’s face.  So that leaves SonAlly, right? Who can deny this one true pairing? They’ve had it for each other since the single digit comic books. Every single time Sonic gets hurt or goes to jail or seemingly dies you can bet your ass that as sure as the sun will rise that Sally has teared up, if not completely lost her shit balling her eyes out. And Sonic has gotten more emotional over Sally than his own family. So what could go wrong with true love?  Also in real life, couples where one side could one day be there and another day not, such as a wife to a police officer or soldier, is ridiculously stressful. On more than one occasion has sally gotten tripped up over sonic being hurt. Yes, the most notable example is from ~135 and leads up to an event that we dont talk about... but it’s accurate. Assuming Sally does want to raise little babies, she needs a hedgehog that will not rush off to adventures every other second and/or might not come home. And considering the number of foes Sonic has is now becoming a phone book in and of itself, this is an issue.   Counterpoint:: The characterization of Sally has significantly changed since Ian took over, so the particular point above is weak, I admit.  Now, before everyone gets the pitchfork out that I might sound like Im justifying the slap, both Sonic and Sally have spent their entire lives fighting and risking terrorizing death or worse. They dont know how to slow down (lol) and experience things, and the transition from everyday adventurer to ruler is probably impossible. It wouldnt be selfish, for either of them, to decline such a life. Real world relationships take a lot of hard work, and every time that Sonic and Sally set down time to try to do just that, it seems really out of place. Remember that time the Iron Queen invaded and turned Nicole into a slave and then the populace shit their collective pants and held a concert where they sung about banishing her? The next fucking episode saw Sonic and Sally completely ignore the issue and go on a date instead. Leaving Nicole to be consoled by friggin Dimitri!!11 of all people.  And as it has in the past, having your spouse beside you on the front line is cool until shit goes south (StH 234), then the loss of one partner could be a career ender for both. You can only imagine the trauma that holding your spouse in your arms as they pass away inflicts on someone. Makes for great TV, and there is something especially heartwarming about a couple that accepts that risk and does it anyways but is otherwise is not a emotionally sound thing to do in real life. The new continuity seeing Sally be much more of a front line fighter only further makes her and Sonic a bad idea. The two greatest heroes/assets to the broken world have way too much on the plate to add relationship woes to it. Do you think Sally would be able to handle Sonic going werehog every night as well as she does if she and him were a thing?  TLDR: Sonally is irresponsible towards the fate of the planet. And considering the two have SUPERHERO as a career choice, it’s a big deal.  In the defense of both of these setups, the mess of the old continuity is largely the basis of reasoning for why I dont think either are a great pairing. Things have changed since the reboot, giving new backstories that aren't entirely drenched in tragedy. New world gives Amy a chance to expand her powers so that she is more than just a silly stalker, and Sally the opportunity to shed her past poor characterizations. It's a big step that King Max isnt demanding she be a pretty princess or force her into an arranged marriage. If it weren't brought up every now and then you might not even remember that Sally is a princess at all. How you feel about that is opinion of course, but it really gives her a chance to expand in other ways.  Its also important to note that the ban on relationships does not cover Sally. She can date anyone she pleases, just NOT Sonic. Whether Ian decides to use this or not is something we will eventually see.  I do imagine, that eventually, given a change in SEGA management, that the limits of Sonic/Tails/Amy being barred from being in a relationship will be lifted, and if given the proper character development, it will be interesting to see which lady Sonic chooses.  EDIT: Changed a few words and added to final paragraph. I swear English is my first language!"
SonicTheHedgehog,3bhn58,65kerensky,6,Mon Jun 29 15:58:28 2015 UTC,"Your argument is probably the best here, and even though I'm a reformed SonAmy elitist I have have to agree with you. However, the one error I noticed was that you said Amy was 6 years younger that Sonic. This isn't the case, as in the games Sonic and Amy are 15 and 12, respectively, putting them only 3 years apart. Not a big deal, but just the slightest bit weird. In the comics, we haven't been given ages post-reboot so I don't know about that. Pre-reboot, however, Sonic is 17 and Amy is 12. That's 5 years apart; this is pretty close to 6 but not quite. Even then we have to keep in mind the effects of the Ring of Acorn which puts Amy at a physical age of 17, the same age as Sonic. So, to recap...  Games: 3 years apart. Slightly weird.  Comics (Post-Reboot): No given ages  Comics (Pre-Reboot): Same age physically, 5 years apart mentally. Amy is pretty mature for her (mental) age, however."
SonicTheHedgehog,3bhn58,ADTJ,2,Mon Jun 29 16:55:25 2015 UTC,"I only covered Comic book Amy/Sally  In game Sonic has zero romantic anything except maybe Blaze and even then thats probably a stretch. The whole lol-Amy-is-your-stalker thing is still part of many of the games.  Sonic Boom Amy I actually like, and it is a big reason I even like Amy at all. I like how she's trying to be something a little more than just his appointed girlfriend. Them being a couple is certainly possible in that timeline, and I think it probably should be!"
SonicTheHedgehog,3bhn58,65kerensky,3,Tue Jun 30 03:28:24 2015 UTC,"Your first post just seemed kind of arsey, but your response was surprisingly well reasoned. I think you won the thread."
SonicTheHedgehog,3be3xd,Notpoe779,8,Sun Jun 28 10:36:15 2015 UTC,"You gotta realize that score is based partially on published reviews the game received when it released. One of them I saw was from 2001 in Electronic Gaming Monthly. So you have a flagship Sonic title on a Sega system, of course it got good reviews back then. The reviews for the 360 and ps3 versions are reviewing a ten year old port from the standpoint of ""did they remaster the graphics to make them HD?"" And ""Is this worth buying brand new rather than picking up the dreamcast collection for 10 bucks used at Game stop and just playing the first one instead"". Meanwhile the Dreamcast version just had to be worth it at a time when Dreamcast owners were having trouble finding exclusive titles that justified their purchase.  Sonic Adventure 2 and 2 Battle are the same game minus some changes to the multiplayer and Chao Garden. If you add in the new Chao minigame, and multiplayer content, Battle was better. If you prefer the Dreamcast version because of VMU support and the controller layout (The dreamcast joystick will always be unique in how it felt) then that's your opinion but Metacritic is just aggregating the published reviews, and DLC ports and GameCube remakes will never score as high as the original purely based on the fact that the reviewers will likely already have a biased opinion based on the original version."
SonicTheHedgehog,3be3xd,darthboolean,5,Sun Jun 28 14:01:05 2015 UTC,"Really every version of SA2 is dated, no matter how many times you port a game you can't fix the fact that it's old and somewhat unenjoyable. That's an opinion however, some people like SA2, and others think it's overrated. To answer your question, I prefer SA2:B on the Gamecube over every other version."
SonicTheHedgehog,3be3xd,PlugM515,0,Mon Jun 29 21:34:10 2015 UTC,that's actually the one i have and that makes me sad  i always assumed tat the dreamcast version had less bugs or something
SonicTheHedgehog,3be3xd,LSStaf,3,Wed Jul 1 00:30:45 2015 UTC,"More bugs, if my memory serves me right."
SonicTheHedgehog,3be3xd,xxfoxtail,5,Sat Jul 4 02:13:13 2015 UTC,"Technically. Not really. They've added more multiplayer features to the non-Dreamcast versions. The DC did have the VMU where you can bring a chao with you. I think the GC version connected to a GBA with Sonic Advance. No idea what the other versions do.   The DC version was the one I've played. Never had the chance for the others. Loved it at the time, looking back it's a little dated."
SonicTheHedgehog,3be3xd,JBrooks_KTD,2,Sun Jun 28 12:06:26 2015 UTC,"This is actually a common thing with remakes. Their justification (on most remakes I've read reviews of) is that it doesn't add too much.  But that's the point of a remake, just bringing it to a new generation. Not to make a whole new game. I know this isn't a Zelda subreddit but Ocarina of Time, often cited as one of the best games of all time, received a lower score on it's 3DS remake, despite adding new game modes and fixing problems the original had, and you know, looking absolutely fucking beautiful. As far as I know Sonic Adventure 2 Battle is the best version of said game."
SonicTheHedgehog,3be3xd,CaptainL95,2,Sun Jun 28 15:17:14 2015 UTC,"The Dreamcast version is probably the worst, actually. It had a couple minor features, sure (VMU, some internet things), but Battle on the Gamecube added a whole bunch more multiplayer stuff, upped the framerate in multiplayer, and added a few graphical touches to the rest of the game. The HD version takes Battle and smooths out the visuals and thankfully adds widescreen support. I've heard some complaints about audio issues in the HD version, but the sound is bad in every version anyway. Also, the HD version is probably the cheapest, especially with Steam sales."
SonicTheHedgehog,3be3xd,bman1394,2,Sun Jun 28 15:31:56 2015 UTC,"No. At the time SA2 was released for the Dreamcast it was amazing. SA2: Battle for the GameCube was even better. However the GameCube port didn't add a whole lot which reviewers lowered the score since it didn't add a substantial amount of content. The scores were even lower for the 360/PS3/PC versions, despite being the best ports, because the game, like SA1, didn't age as well. There's a lot of modern advances in gaming that haven't been integrated in the newer ports which is why they feel dated and unimpressive."

I imagine you're aware that the PS3/360 HD re-release has online playability, so on some relevant-enough forums/IRC channels you might be able to find some people willing to give you some good matches, though honestly I don't imagine that many take it too seriously. It's worth noting that The Sonic Center has times charts for the game though besides the top 4/5 players none of us have properly bothered with it haha (I'm 4th with Sonic with times that are nothing special); there's also three videos for what it's worth of some pretty good runs and you can probably find more on YouTube demonstrating good tactics, though it shouldn't be too hard figuring out which moves with each character are the most effective.

Sure, there are embarrassments like 06 and Shadow, but overall I think people are overly hard on Sonic. It's the franchise everyone loves to hate.  I've always like how deep the world is in Sonic. Not really just the games, but the cartoons and the comics and even the fandom. That's one thing Sonic has always had over Mario. Sure, Mario games tend to be better, but the Sonic world has personality. The levels and soundtrack are so memorable.  I just wish we'd get surreal levels designs again, like CD and S3&K."
SonicTheHedgehog,3bcyxi,retro_paladin,3,Sun Jun 28 02:41:03 2015 UTC,"I'd say the paper Mario games give the Mario world a lot of personality, but yeah in terms of mainline platformer games there's not all that much. Mario games tend to skip straight to the gameplay and avoid story."
SonicTheHedgehog,3bcyxi,Chezzymann,4,Sun Jun 28 19:17:51 2015 UTC,"I do think the Paper Mario games are pretty good. It's not just the games, though. Mario has always had few media presences outside the games, while Sonic has had many excellent cartoons and the Archie comics.   Basically, Sonic is a media franchise and Mario is usually just games. Nintendo is more conservative with how Mario is portrayed, given he is their mascot and all. Sega is usually more liberal with Sonic. This backfires at times, but makes him way more interesting IMO."
SonicTheHedgehog,3bcyxi,retro_paladin,5,Sun Jun 28 20:44:28 2015 UTC,"I had a few paragraphs written out for this comment describing my opinion on all sorts of things. I decided it was just me dancing around facts I don't want to address.  Yeah Generations and Shadow are good, so are some of the racers, but I really don't like most sonic games. I didn't grow up with any games, TV shows, or comics. I had a fanboy free childhood, yet here I am watching Sonic X and browsing /r/SonictheHedgehog. I lack the nostalgia factor that most people have, yet I still listen to the soundtracks and draw fanart.  I've been sitting here trying to figure out why I have this minor obsession with a fast blue rodent, and I haven't come up with anything. Maybe I just needed something to occupy my time, maybe I have some subconscious connection to the characters. I don't know and I don't care because I like liking things.  I enjoy reading comic books that have had their canon torn apart by petty writers. I like watching kids shows with awful writing and god awful plots. Most of all I love to listen to music that resonates so well.  Tl;Dr I don't know why I like Sonic. I just do and I'm going to embrace that."
SonicTheHedgehog,3bcyxi,Neapher,2,Sun Jun 28 04:23:04 2015 UTC,"Solid, bro.  Great to hear your side of it, and I can agree that.  To add to that, I like to believe myself that if you look in the right places, I think you can find better Sonic content done by fans that Sega could ever do in their, um... current stage.  The comics for example: sure, there's a little controversy revolving the artist depicting Sonic crying on a front cover that got Sega mad, but aside from that, these guys are fans and they managed to create the longest running comic based on a video game. (With the least annoying romance sections out of every comic ever. XD)  And yeah, the soundtracks are amazing, whether some of it's ""buttrock"" or not."

SonicTheHedgehog,3bcyxi,C-Abdulio,4,Sun Jun 28 06:27:00 2015 UTC,"That is a very subjective opinion and probably why I have trouble trying to give Joe a good answer.   Using SA2 is a guideline to measure what is the best quality in a Sonic game is a very flawed premise as SA2 was a very flawed game. That so called ""critical acclaim"" of yours...that was 2001 dude. SA2 was one of the last good games of a dying system and the only comparisiona at the time where more mediocre plat formers from the DC and PS1/PS2 and platformers from the N64...oh and the previous Sonic Adventure.  Now a days, among hardcore fans, which game is the best is highly debatable but most casual gaming fans will either point you in the direction of Generations or Colors based on reviewer score and reputation alone...and even that is wearing off fast.   SA2 wore out it's welcome among the general populace years ago and has often been blamed for some of the less desirable aspects of the fandom (the terrible OCs, the messed up fan fiction, the worship of Shadow the Edgelord, and creating a culture that mixes the worst of Sonic with the worst of anime)"

I guess this is what happens when all the old-skool Sonic fans grow up and stop paying much attention :P  I'd guess that whilst most ""active"" Sonic fans may think SA2 is the best, if you asked everyone who's ever been a huge Sonic fan, S3&K would still come out on top. A lot of the people who liked the early games have no love for any of the newer stuff, and that's probably a part of why they're not Sonic fans any more. That, and the fact that they're probably in their thirties now.  However, I did go on to read the rest of your post, and calling the original games sub-par platformers? I just can't agree. What other platformers were around at that time that were so good that Sonic was sub-par?"
SonicTheHedgehog,3bcyxi,Unrelentingpisstrain,-4,Sun Jun 28 04:17:39 2015 UTC,"Megaman, Mario, Kirby, Kid Icarus, Shatterhand, Ninja Gaiden, Castlevania, Metroid, DUCK TALES... the list goes on.  At least THESE games had a solid gameplay mechanic that was persistent throughout the entire game.  Sega rushed the first game of a series meant to rival Mario and they seem to be doing the same thing today.  But aside from that, despite their games, they made arguably one of the best cast of characters to date for a video game series.  And I can appreciate that."
SonicTheHedgehog,3bcyxi,Riktenkay,3,Sun Jun 28 05:06:05 2015 UTC,I'd say Sonic is as good or even better than some of those games. In what way does Sonic not have a solid gameplay mechanic?
SonicTheHedgehog,3bcyxi,Unrelentingpisstrain,2,Mon Jun 29 13:06:43 2015 UTC,"Why do I like Sonic? That's a really good question, I've never really thought about it tbh. I would say Sonic's speed and attitude is what made me a fan. I'm all for slower platforming sections in Sonic games, but I feel that the speed sections are what distinguished Sonic from everyone else. I don't think many other games at the time of Sonic 1 had speed and platforming, all while maintaining tight control over your character. I like Sonic Generations because it was fast when necessary and slow when necessary. Sure the dialogue was cheesy, but that was the point. That, and the mod support is insane.  Of course there are many more Sonic games I enjoy like Sonic Adventure 1 and 2, Sonic Colors, Sonic 3&K, etc, but I just listed Generations only out of laziness. That being said though, Sonic is another one of my favorite video game characters and not just out of nostalgia.  By the way, I don't pay much attention to the Sonic fandom, or any fandom for that matter. Sure, recolors are ridiculous and all, but just about every fandom has it as well. Also, I just let people do their thing. If they want to make fetish art , who am I to stop them?   Hope this answers your question!"

Once you get past Green Hill zone there's not really even much point being such a fast character any more. But of course, it was revolutionary at the time and paved the way for them to perfect things and take full advantage of his speed in the next 3 games.  Then rather than make another proper sequel they made Chaotix, where the whole feel of the game is ruined by the elastic band mechanic, and then they went completely off the rails and gave up on true Sonic platformers altogether. Basically, Sega are a bunch of muppets.  The Sonic Advance series was awesome though. Sonic Rush a bit less so. Sonic 4... the less said about that the better. As for the 3D games, I enjoyed Adventure when it came out and really liked Adventure 2. Heroes I've barely played but it seems gash. Shadow The Hedgehog was alright. Haven't really played much of the newer ones at all."

SonicTheHedgehog,3bcyxi,MarshManOriginal,2,Sun Jun 28 18:10:59 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I've played pretty much all of the sonic games and I do love them all. But there is only 1 game that I always remember fondly, playing it again after reminiscing on how good it was and not being disappointed. Wasn't any of the originals, it wasn't either of the adventure games, but instead it was the first game i saw the announcement for and said ""nope, I'm out. Sonic's become too stupid and I have definitely outgrown playing his games."" That game was Sonic Colours. I remember seeing the wisps and thinking they were so childish and the song (reach for the stars) was stupid and after the frustrating later levels of daytime unleashed I wasn't at all interested in the gameplay.  ... But then it got stellar reviews so I bought it and played it. And, dear god, I loved it. The new voice actor for Sonic was really funny (even though some of the lines were cringed I totally believed Sonic's attitude), Tails's new VA was spot on with giving him a young voice that didn't make me want to rip my ears off. Cubit and robot were funny while Eggman was genuinely threatening while also having some great lines himself (his announcements during the first few levels were hilarious).  And the gameplay: I loved it. It didn't have the problem Generations and Unleashed had where you boosted constantly and so didn't appreciate any of the level by reducing the maximum boost you have, how often that charges and giving you a double jump for precise jumping on 2D sections.  I will always sing high praises for Colours and I really do think it's the best. Feel free to disagree: it's just my opinion :)"
SonicTheHedgehog,3bcyxi,StandupGaming,2,Sun Jun 28 23:43:03 2015 UTC,"Hotlist of things Sega should do:   More playable characters than just Sonic (I reckon including Tails and Shadow at least) Less total characters 2D and 3D segments Return to the two acts and a boss format. Include a fun, vibrant soundtrack. Have a hubworld that isn't bland and doesn't force itself down your throat. (looking at you, 06) and a Chao garden.   Make it happen Sega."

Sonic Team never improved the Sonic Adventure formula like, say, Nintendo improved the 3D Mario formula. So it's harder to ignore it's problems. The Adventure games seem to get worse and worse every year, and Sonic Team hasn't attempted to go back to the formula since '06.  And by your logic, a good review score automatically means a game is good. Those reviewers presumed subconsciously that a newer Sonic game would come out and fix the problems of the old ones. Notice how the Sonic Adventure remakes got much lower scores for not adding anything substantial."

SonicTheHedgehog,3bcyxi,xxfoxtail,1 point,Sun Jun 28 03:42:48 2015 UTC,"For the 'older' generation, I guess it has to do with the  nostalgia for the original 2D Sonic games. You feel that Sonic is kind of a part you in some respects.   For the 'newer' generation, I think it has to do with Sonic as a character. He's relatable in many aspects of his personality, and they connect with him through that.   Even if the games were mediocre or just plain bad, Sonic still shows a certain charm for everyone.  Personally, I'm kind of in the middle of those two explanations. I never played the original 2D games but I grew up playing the early 3D games. Those kind of memories kind of gave me a sense that Sonic was, to a small degree, a part of who I am and I still hold on to those feelings. Also, for a young me to originally play games where Sonic could display personality and talk, I kind of found him as a kind of a friend I could never meet in real life but had all the aspects that I wanted for myself and that I wanted my friends to have.  That, and the music."

The music is nice, and the gameplay is pretty fun! Only complaints are the loading times and that some graphics look a bit JPEG-ish, but I'm playing on iPad so maybe they're just stretched.  Edit: Another complaint is that it requires internet to launch. I was looking forward to playing this on an upcoming flight but it seems I won't be able to :/"
SonicTheHedgehog,3b2b13,Willardbaggins,2,Thu Jun 25 19:57:31 2015 UTC,Probably isn't updated for retina/large displays

SonicTheHedgehog,3b2b13,OceanHeart,2,Thu Jun 25 22:44:08 2015 UTC,"My thoughts from yesterday since it got released a day early for a bit:  ""I'm really loving this so far! I'm already on episode 10 and I wasn't even expecting a story. The timers are no worry since depending on your score, you could easily play this forever. What I mean is the lives/replays restock once you finish an episode and you could well finish an episode in just one run. Very fun, good music, great fan service with the buddies.  I'll be playing this for a while!""  After playing today:  I'm still having a lot of fun with this. I already got the soundtrack and I'm just glad how it all fits in. Today I finally saved enough eggs to spin the better prize wheel again. I actually landed on a super rare and got the battle cruiser! It's awesome and big. I get a lot more Red Rings now even though I haven't spent any yet. I also got Knuckles today and he's the hardest one to use so far. Of course I'm not used to him yet. I hope I can still unlock the Chaotix as I see some people using them. As for Amy, it's good I have an iOS gaming account but I doubt I can get her with the whole referral thing. Oh well.  Since I got to play yesterday, I saw the changes made. I don't like how they nerfed a lot of the buddies. Also I get 5 red rings after each episode now instead of 10. Hm. The whole Exp thing really doesn't change anything but at least it's there for those who want it.  I'm still having a lot of fun so it doesn't matter and I'm enjoying it so much that I'm glad the timers are there. Else I could play this forever. Once Knuckles is unlocked the score requirement is a lot higher. You can still beat an episode without ever waiting but I'm sure it's going to ramp up again soon.  If you're a Sonic fan, I'm sure you'll enjoy the game for the core gameplay and not worry over the free to play elements."
SonicTheHedgehog,3b2b13,Cirnol,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:06:04 2015 UTC,"I like that they added an automatic leveling system in addition to the previous one where you just paid rings. I still feel like I should horde the rings for classic sonic and metal sonic whenever they come out, but it's a nice touch, but I'm just weird like that."

SonicTheHedgehog,3avv4j,xxfoxtail,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:19:19 2015 UTC,"Same here; Nintendo's the only company I'm really interested in from a console perspective these days, not really drawn in by Sony and Microsoft's current-gen hardware what with the more appealing alternative of a gaming rig."
SonicTheHedgehog,3avv4j,spanieldaniel,5,Wed Jun 24 19:01:31 2015 UTC,No. It wouldn't survive in the current gaming market. Unless Sega themselves can actually get back to developing games instead of merchandise and use some of their IPs then maybe.
SonicTheHedgehog,3avv4j,bman1394,3,Wed Jun 24 01:29:26 2015 UTC,nice try Sega
SonicTheHedgehog,3avv4j,thesaifking,3,Wed Jun 24 13:39:14 2015 UTC,Definitely!  It would mostly depend on the software though.  A new Phantasy Star or Shining Force would be great.

SonicTheHedgehog,3avv4j,ADTJ,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:42:09 2015 UTC,it would probably have shenmue 3 if they were going to make one but since its going to be on ps4 and pc they obvs arent
SonicTheHedgehog,3avv4j,iSuperfusionzx,1 point,Fri Jul 3 10:48:10 2015 UTC,Yeah if they would bring back some dreamcast franchises they keep lying around.
SonicTheHedgehog,3avv4j,footlesssushi,1 point,Wed Jun 24 07:19:05 2015 UTC,"Yes. I almost bought a PS4 from the Shenmue news. But just because I would doesn't mean others would. Sega lost their console abilities to just the PS2 really before it was even out. They didn't have the best 3rd party support during the Dreamcast's life. If they made a new console they would have to make games of higher quality then they have currently been doing (remember this?!) They would be in the same shoes as Nintendo. Low 3rd party support again. Developers would have 4 platforms to possibly develop for? (Xbox One, Playstation 4, Wii U, PC) It would be a absolute huge up hill battle Sega just doesn't seem ready to face again. TLDR: FUCK They can't even give us PSO2?! :("

SonicTheHedgehog,3avv4j,supersonicsmash,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:41:27 2015 UTC,"The PS4 is vastly outselling the Wii U. They would be competing with sony and microsoft too, not just nintendo"
SonicTheHedgehog,3avv4j,iSuperfusionzx,1 point,Fri Jul 3 10:50:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'd want to support them.  I'd want to see at least one or two unusual or really interesting launch titles though. The Dreamcast has Sonic Adventure and Blue Stinger (that was a fun game, cheesy fun)."
SonicTheHedgehog,3avv4j,SimonLaFox,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:57:24 2015 UTC,"Potentially. The Dreamcast was a great system and ahead of its time when it came out, and is a shame that it died so quickly. While I would be a little skeptical since they have been out of the console market for over a decade, if they made one that would support the majority of 3rd party games and have a number of good Sega IPs and exclusives I would heavily consider it."
SonicTheHedgehog,3avv4j,SonicPunk96,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:18:02 2015 UTC,"Realistically, probably not. As much as I love SEGA and would like to see them succeed, I haven't owned any consoles for a while now and I would be reluctant to buy them again. It's not anything specifically against consoles, but I have basically switched to PC because it's easier to store and play games on it.  EDIT: Also it's why I wish they would stop with the Nintendo exclusives."
SonicTheHedgehog,3avv4j,retro_paladin,2,Wed Jun 24 01:21:41 2015 UTC,"I agree with you on the whole gaming PCs are generally better investments and experiences when it's a viable alternative for a gamer than current-gen games consoles are thing, though of course Nintendo work on the basis that almost all their quality stuff is exclusive to their hardware. I can't fault their business model as personally I think they publish games worth playing and release good hardware that's affordable, durable, compatible and relevant for a long time etc. and overall worthwhile purchasing if you like the content; if they began releasing their console exclusives on PC I don't think they'd, even with flagship IPs like Mario, Zelda etc., be able to compete well enough with the PC games market to be able to thrive and stay successful enough as a company (particularly as many of those IPs primarily target a younger audience who are more likely to use consoles than gaming PCs). It's the same thing with their handheld consoles, which personally I love and think are one of the best things about Nintendo; if those games came to say PSP instead, Nintendo likely wouldn't do all that great. I don't mean to sound like a Nintendo fanboy here lol but just expressing how I feel on Nintendo's exclusivity.   As for Sega releasing a new console (in an idyllic work where they could realistically compete and maintain economic success in the market) that's an interesting one; with gaming PCs being a thing I'd only be interested in buying a new Sega console if enough alluring exclusive games were coming to the system (if some good Sonic games were coming only to the system say... ah, in a dream world ay :P ... I'd almost definitely get one, at least at some point, possibly in the future once prices came down), and I'm not sure if I'd want to blow my money on one of those and the current Nintendo home console (or handheld console, for that matter, who said Sega were making a home system? :P). If the Nintendo console seemed the better investment and I wasn't swimming in cash at the time (of course if I was I'd just buy every game system, even the Game.com :P mwahahahaha), I'd probably get that over the Sega console truth be told (at least initially), I love Sega but I ain't no illogical hardcore fanboy. (Interesting question by the way OP, props for bringing it up!)"
SonicTheHedgehog,3avv4j,spanieldaniel,2,Wed Jun 24 19:16:08 2015 UTC,"I think my post was a little unclear - I meant the recent Sonic Nintendo exclusives. I expect Nintendo to keep their IPs exclusive on their consoles; it is their business model after all. I don't own a Nintendo console and I am okay on missing out on the few of their IPs I enjoy.   Really I just want Sonic to come back to the PC. The best selling Sonic games (Heroes, Unleashed, and Generations) were all multiplatform."
SonicTheHedgehog,3avv4j,retro_paladin,2,Wed Jun 24 20:42:05 2015 UTC,"Sorry for initially misinterpreting your post! While I am a Nintendo console player myself and will continue to buy Nintendo consoles in the future purely because I personally like what they have to offer, I too wish the Sonic exclusives will stop soon. I wouldn't buy a Nintendo console purely for a Sonic game and I don't like the way that the IP which isn't even Nintendo owned (I know Sega's a business, but it just feels like it's kinda selling out to Nintendo at the moment) has been exclusive on their systems for recent games, depriving Sonic fans who aren't Nintendo console users of the games and essentially stifling the franchise; Sonic'd have more breadth and development freedom on other platforms and I've love to see new (good!) Sonic games come to the PC and other current-gen systems. I agree that the multiplatform games you mentioned (as well as others such as the Adventure games) are definitely some of the best to come out of the franchise in recent years and it's just a shame for Sega to be under this contract with Nintendo, at least it was only for an x number of games as far as I recall so we should see Sonic come back to other platforms pretty soon."
SonicTheHedgehog,3avv4j,spanieldaniel,2,Wed Jun 24 20:57:07 2015 UTC,"I do know that contract was for three games. I'm not sure if they reached that limit yet or not. Hopefully all the Sonic Boom titles counted and the 25th anniversary game can be multiplatform.  EDIT: Just looked it up, it was Lost Worlds, an Olympics title, and an ""unannounced (in 2013)"" title, which I am guessing was Boom."
SonicTheHedgehog,3avv4j,retro_paladin,2,Wed Jun 24 23:01:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I recall the number of games the contract was for being three, around the time the London Olympics game was on the horizon and Lost World had been announced etc... so now with Boom released also, I think Sega's game ties with Nintendo are pretty wrapped up. Let's hope they don't soon dive into another agreement like this (and that the 25th Anniversary title's multiplatform indeed!)."

Runs at a constant 60 fps and does not have the bugs present in the PS2 version.  Gamecube is your best option, but if PC is more convenient, that version will do."

An Xbox controller will work nicely if you have one, but you could probably use any gamepad, and you can configure the controls in game.

SonicTheHedgehog,39xdwk,rokama,2,Mon Jun 15 16:53:09 2015 UTC,I have the PC version. It works pretty well but I've never played any other version to compare. It worked straight away for me installing from the disc on a x64 Win8.1 computer. No need to mess around with drivers or fan patches. Hasn't crashed for me or anything. Xinput controller (DS3 using SCP drivers) worked out of the box too just needed a bit of trial and error to figure out good bindings.
SonicTheHedgehog,39xdwk,KFCNyanCat,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:54:49 2015 UTC,"+1 for the PC version. Can even be played in very high resolution, but you have to manually patch the exe for that.  Anyway, the configurable controls alone (gamepad highly recommended) make the game much better. I never liked how they used the X and Y buttons on the GC pad to switch characers, but I can see how they had no other choice. On the PC version, I prefer to assign the left and right bumpers to that. Keeps your thumb free and reactive for the action buttons."

Much of the new direction of the comic, dumping of characters, expulsion of story arcs and back stories all comes from the legal fallout of this irl bull. I dont like the Mega Man crossover either, but this was one of the better, abet limited, choices that Archie had."
SonicTheHedgehog,39vqhk,65kerensky,9,Mon Jun 15 05:43:37 2015 UTC,"I completely disagree.  The comics were so convoluted and ridiculous before the reboot.  I've really enjoyed the post-reboot main series.  The Fighters arc especially was really enjoyable.  I also totally disagree with you about the art style.  That cover you linked to looks terrible.  Look at Sonic's spines, FFS.  That character doesn't even look like Sonic."
SonicTheHedgehog,39vqhk,Vehk,3,Mon Jun 15 14:09:04 2015 UTC,"agree. Love triangles that got silly, ""on and off again"" and ""will they or wont they?"" I lost track of the echedina lore and the 50 different shades of red/purple that came with it.  Some of the (final) arcs seemed interesting but the mounds of mess it was built upon made it difficult to even crack the storyline to someone that hadnt read it before.  I do hope the comic can return to (some) serious storylines but I have faith in the new stories.  And the artwork is pretty cool too."
SonicTheHedgehog,39vqhk,65kerensky,3,Mon Jun 15 15:14:00 2015 UTC,The artwork has been fairly great since the reboot.
SonicTheHedgehog,39vqhk,Vehk,3,Mon Jun 15 15:37:41 2015 UTC,The echidna lore was actually one of my favourite parts of the series before the reboot. Is it really all just gone?

SonicTheHedgehog,39vqhk,thatnerdynerd,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:33:27 2015 UTC,"True and true, but as a final middle finger to Penders they took all of his especially beloved characters and banished, dismissed or killed them. For the triple agent skunk himself... they had him become demonically possessed by an evil wizard. One of his final scenes has him give a hair raising grin right after it happens  I know the behind the scenes reason why it was done, but they cant just write that out in the comic, the characters have be dealt with in semi-plausible ways at least"
SonicTheHedgehog,39vqhk,65kerensky,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:03:03 2015 UTC,Good point.  It does seem like a waste of fully fleshed out plots. ..but oh well.

It doesn't break anything for me  but going from loving parents   to being an orphan forever... and now remembering them ....well that's lamr
SonicTheHedgehog,39vqhk,thatnerdynerd,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:13:40 2015 UTC,"It does. But also, there are a lot lot lot of other things that Archie tried during the old continuity that was stupid or didnt make sense. The new continuity gives them an opportunity to keep the things that were good, create new potential, and ditch the bad parts.  I will miss most of the parents/siblings/children of the old characters. Old king Max was kind of a dick and treated his very capable and independent daughter like a piece of property, and tails parents are just something else however. Im ok that they're gone."
SonicTheHedgehog,39vqhk,65kerensky,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:20:41 2015 UTC,Max was insanely annoying. He gave no one respect lol. He is a cliche of a stubborn king..like Odin ..who did more harm than good.  I like tails being orphaned as well.  I am actually fine with them all being orphans  but I was genuinely happy that they got their parents back and we're happy .   Oh well embrace  change
SonicTheHedgehog,39vqhk,thatnerdynerd,8,Thu Jul 9 18:24:40 2015 UTC,"Get off of Reddit, Ken Penders.  You can't be serious. Your example of the ""better"" comic is without a doubt one of the very worst moments to ever occur in the entire series. Need a refresher? I'll give you a minute.   That right there is how you take every defining trait of a beloved character, and drag it through pure, unrefined shit. And issues around the #51-159 were full of stupid stuff like this. Call it classic comic book antics all you want, but that doesn't belong in something about Sonic the Hedgehog. We want to see Sonic and the gang having fun, kicking ass, and crazy adventures; not high school drama, political discussion, or dips into domestic abuse.  I grew up reading these comics. I was really sad to see the old universe go. But considering the behind-the-scenes stuff that led to it, and that the reboot got rid of a lot of trash characters and situations, I'd say the change was for the better."
SonicTheHedgehog,39vqhk,Sea-Salt,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:19:56 2015 UTC,"Look, Ken may have been an ass as far as copyrighting his own characters, and he ultimately screwed the franchise over, but the Mobius 25 and 30 years later arcs were my favorite of the series. He gave the characters real issues to deal with. Now, what we are left with feels like Mickey Mouse and the gang vs mean ol Pete. There is no real threat or sense of urgency and without many supporting characters for the main crew to interact with, why should the audience care if the world (Mobius) ends. We know the main group will always turn out fine and we literally don't care about anyone else on the planet now, so what is there to involve us?"
SonicTheHedgehog,39vqhk,Sea-Salt,3,Tue Jun 16 22:58:42 2015 UTC,"No threat? Did you miss the part about the entire world being a broken mess of tectonic plates?   As for the lack of supporting characters; we're dealing with only about 20 pages a month (40 if you include Universe) to set up a whole new world. We're about two years in, and it's still going to be a while until we get a fully-realized world. This isn't something you can rush, and even when the comic first started, it took about as long to finally get things going.  And hell, in that time, we've gotten:   An underwater civilization with aquatic mobians who aren't just generic sea animals. A full city run by one crafty woman, who straight-up owns the airwaves and has a good portion of the world wrapped around her finger. To the point that Eggman can do little to sway her. GUN being a major player in the world at large. Not to mention one that could be heading towards some serious internal turmoil (Eggman freakin' WORKED for these guys before).   If you think the comic is kiddy, it's because it's sort of supposed to be. It needs to be suitable for kids, and I think Ian Flynn and the gang are doing it in an excellent way that makes it enjoyable for older fans as well, with a cool story and loads of callbacks to the olden days of Sonic's games and cartoons. Of course the heroes are going to be okay; do you really expect them to off the main characters?  Also, the two Mobius: X Years Later arcs are on completely different sides of the spectrum. Penders gave us crap like slumber parties, and Sally staying out of the politics of her own kingdom, instead having Sonic deal with it. See anything wrong with this picture?  Ian gave us time travel and Sonic going all New Avengers on us, showing himself as a king who hasn't forgotten his days of kicking ass and having a blast while doing it. Everybody acts like how they should, and it isn't 90% focused on Penders' Knuckles recolors.  I think you really need to go back and read the old comics.  There were some fun times, yeah, but there are moments when you have to think ""does this really belong in a story about Sonic?"""
SonicTheHedgehog,39vqhk,65kerensky,4,Tue Jun 16 23:28:16 2015 UTC,"One of my personal favorite things about the new continuity is that Antoine and Bunny are not only still married but actually get to enjoy the fun and happy parts of being married and not be surrounded by death and misfortune.  In the old continuity, Antoine and Bunny got married in spectacular fashion on the eve of a major invasion by Eggman that saw Knothole burned down to barren wasteland (175). Then they fought back, defeated him, only to have the Iron Queen assault their home, take control of Bunnie's cybernetics and nearly exhaust her lifeforce. Almost, twice.  Then, honeymoon...? NOPE THE BIRDS HAVE COMETH AND THEY DESPISE YOU LAND WALKERS (SU 13-16)  And finally when everything seemed to maybe maybe go back to normal... Genesis Wave One hits and Bunnie gets de-roboticized losing all self confidence, Sally gets turned into Mecha Sally, and Antoine teeters on the brink of death after taking an IED to the face... RIGHT IN FRONT OF BUNNIE. I mean try to read 234 and not cry at the very end. TRY. And those events cause the Freedom Fighters to disband, and we reboot the series with Antoine still in a coma and Bunnie MIA (mostly). Keep in mind that mecha sally starts in sth 230 and Antoine is rendered comatose in sth 234. Those four issues span maybe a full week of mobian time tops. Thats a lot to lose in a short span of time!  To see them actually have good days while being married is a sigh of relief and great turn of events.  http://www.deviantart.com/art/Bunnie-and-Antoine-sketch-326538099  EDIT: ALSO ANTOINE ISNT A WUSS ANYMORE AND BUNNIE IS BACK TO BEING AN AWESOME CYBORG ACTION LADY DID I MENTION THAT?"
SonicTheHedgehog,39vqhk,Sea-Salt,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:58:08 2015 UTC,"My reference to the world ending was the tectonic plates. We may have the under water city and Casinopolis, but their connection to the Sonic and the gang is what makes us feel involved as well and honestly those places were like stepping stones for Sonic. What we need is something like Knothole or Mobo/Robotropolis. Even if our characters are going to be ok, I at least want to be concerned about their well being.  You say they need their time to build a new world and get involved, but how can they do that when they keep interrupting story flow with crossovers (Worlds Unite is coming up). This latest run of Sonic  is feeling like the latest run of Deadpool. I like them both, but both feel super rushed and full of interrupting side stories.    P.S. Come on, GUN? I like them and want to see more too, but they showed up briefly in two issues. Those appearances don't mean much until they get a story arc or continued appearances.  P.P.S. How did you use bullet points in reddit?"
SonicTheHedgehog,39vqhk,MajinV232,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:14:31 2015 UTC,"The crossovers would be happening regardless of who is at the helm of the writing team. That's something being enforced over Ian's head; he's just doing what he can to make it work with the ongoing story.  It just happened to be more convenient the first time, since they were going to reboot the comic anyway, and the events of Worlds Collide gave them a decent in-story excuse."
SonicTheHedgehog,39vqhk,65kerensky,3,Wed Jun 17 14:56:23 2015 UTC,"Fire Ian Flynn? You mean fire the person who actually made this comic something good after years of convoluted plotlines and pointless romantic BS, and gave the Sonic comic it's widely regarded ""Golden Age?""  Never thought I'd see the day, but I think we've got a Penders fanboy here."
SonicTheHedgehog,39vqhk,65kerensky,4,Tue Jun 16 17:16:49 2015 UTC,"CHARACTERS  Most of my favorites came from SatAM, but I did like Scourge too! Shard could have been an interesting development. Otherwise though, I think the comic had just way too many people, each one with a backstory and destiny and all that. Sonic Universe has really helped this out, but it still felt cramped sometimes..."
SonicTheHedgehog,39vqhk,65kerensky,2,Mon Jun 15 05:54:15 2015 UTC,Wow! Thank you for your enthusiasm! This definitely sheds some light on things. I just wish they can figure things out because some of the other Archie titles seem to be improving while Sonic just feels like the lost child.
SonicTheHedgehog,39vqhk,65kerensky,3,Mon Jun 15 06:03:15 2015 UTC,"The reboot came with a list of things SEGA demanded. Some of the bigger sticking points were that Archie couldnt re-introduce certain characters, certain themes, etc.  The big points from the ""list""  **Main characters cant have on screen families (many jettisoned characters were family ties to the main cast)(Sally's father King Max is exempt because he appeared in an important story arc in the SatAM version)(Same for Uncle Chuck and Rosie)  **Main characters cant be in relationships (with each other at least..?)(Obviously Bunnie and Antoine are exempt)(No more sonic/sally/amy shipping thank god)  **Anything mentioning Echidinas (As the artist in question put a lot of time into the echidina culture so Knuckles' family history, culture, Dark Brotherhood, hell nearly everything about him is VERY STRICTLY off limits)(And it will likely stay that way :'c)  **Alternative timelines/worlds are out (A lot of dumped characters are future versions/ potential offspring)(Or 'bad boy' alternates from Moebius etc)(Which is why Scourge and the Suppression Squad are gone)  **Other characters directly created by said artist that do not fall into the above categories(Mina)(Geoffery St John)(Substitute Freedom Fighters)  Likewise, characters from the archie comic are legally barred from being in SEGA games (this got the whole fucking lawsuit thing started)(No Bunnie/Antoine/Rotor/Sally games, sadly)  All of that means the reboot and the future of the series has to follow all those rules, otherwise SEGA threatened to cancel Sonic licensing to Archie, ending the comic series franchise entirely. The above rules could eventually be relaxed (with sole exception to Knuckles) given enough time, but while we may not like some parts of the comic now, it was that or nothing whatsoever."
SonicTheHedgehog,39vqhk,65kerensky,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:43:50 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, was sega just trying to fuck sonic over? Why did all this happen and why is knuckles in particular getting screwed so hard? Also all of the restrictions prevent anything really involved from happening."
SonicTheHedgehog,39vqhk,thatnerdynerd,3,Mon Jun 15 21:27:59 2015 UTC,"SEGA is avoiding getting sued/hit with copyright claims. All those characters I outlined above belong to said rogue writer as he laid a copyright claim on ALL of them. He owns all those guys, despite not being remotely associated with SEGA in any capacity. If SEGA or Archie uses/mentions them in comic TV or video game form, they have to pay royalties and allow the disgruntled writer creative control over how they are portrayed. This puts SEGA in such a shitty position because it forces them to never acknowledge any of those characters even existed anymore since it means giving that guy money and the satisfaction that what he did was somehow ok.  SEGA doesnt want to gimp sonic but it would rather do that over giving this guy money or control over something that isnt his in any way. The comics are really really constrained by this, obviously, and between greed, pride, and just wanting to be assholes to each other, the fanbase loses out."
SonicTheHedgehog,39vqhk,65kerensky,3,Mon Jun 15 23:37:35 2015 UTC,"Knuckles gets the hard shaft because the ""pet project"" of this writer, as the basis for the lawsuit that started this mess, is Knuckles and his Dark Brotherhood. Said writer wants premier treatment of Knuckles, attributes himself as the sole reason this character was popular at all, and wants to get back at Archie for cancelling the spin off comic focused on echidina culture/lore.   This writer is currently writing/drawing/rewriting a fanfic/spinoff using what is now his 'copyrighted' material. SEGA rightly views this character as a sore reminder of everything this writer stands for and the legal mess he created. Thus Knuckles has been offically stripped of anything other than himself and his master emerald. He has no family, no known history, and his culture died out long ago. Even if all the other restrictions are eventually lifted due to time and management changes, Knuckles is likely never going to be further developed again. Its just asking for a copyright infringement lawsuit"

I mean its been much much worse (StH 113 comes to mind, it looks like a shitty fanfic drawing)"
SonicTheHedgehog,39vqhk,Sonickku,3,Mon Jun 15 05:49:49 2015 UTC,"The cover you're supposed to be saying looks good is just...awful. The art has improved and it doesn't look like disjointed garbage anymore.  And every comic series gets reboots. Have you ever read about the mess of crap they did with Spider-man? Seriously listen to the person saying why they had to reboot. I mean Ogilvie Maurice Hedgehog? A lot of that older stuff was melodramatic trash you'd find in bad fan fiction. It's probably why I didn't collect or read the comic when I was younger despite living a stone's throw from a comic book store that's been in the same place since the stone age, and is in fact where I get my issues now.   Howard the Duck is a classic comic too, but it's comics turned to crap because of the behind the scenes garbage messing it up. And it died. Even though it was a hit when it came out to everyone's surprise. It only just got a reboot because of 15 seconds of a blockbuster movie's stinger. After that and the shudders movie.   And I have to admit this comic is way better. It's not bogged down with... wait for it... melodramatic crap. Reading the new ones I realized that's what Beverly was in the old comics and too much was about her and not Howard. Now she's gone and the comic is better for it.   If you wanna be mad about the comics be mad that they stopped Sonic boom for no reason other than to put out more Archie spinoffs that barely anyone wanted."
SonicTheHedgehog,39vqhk,contentfreetime,3,Tue Jun 16 04:57:33 2015 UTC,"What happened to the comics?? I mean, I know it's a copyright thing, but what, like, caused it in the first place?? I'm not that aware.  I haven't read a single issue in months. Not because ""I don't like it"", but because I've lost the source I've used to read them haha I'm not used to the reboot yet. I was losing enthusiasm. Now, I could read them, of course, but I won't forget and miss the joy I've had with the old issues It hit me hard. I really loved the comic simply because the way it was. All the epic stories, these were good times. Fave characters like Hershey, Geoffrey, Shard, heck Dimitri!! I hated the reboot happened just when he was changing, such a character I've loved its development, and I was getting fond of him. God I miss them. Mammoth Mogul, etc...    I swear I just could throw away anything and just start reading again the comics. There are many things I didn't pay that much attention (especially Knuckes' series, many important stuff happened there)    Questions, as I haven't read them in a far while.  •There was an issue, an odd issue I can't remember. It was fro the early ones I think.  Some interlgalactic entity captured the Freedom Fighters and Robotnik, and kept them trapped, like ants haha. Which one was that? • There was a guy, (inker?) who drew.. in a cartoonish style. Hahaha I've really enjoyed them. Funny how something dramatic happened, and I was still laughing at the art haha. Who was that"
SonicTheHedgehog,39vqhk,65kerensky,2,Thu Jun 18 00:09:48 2015 UTC,"The original incident involves the copyright held on Dark Echidna brotherhood. They came from Archie comics, and were used by SEGA for the Sonic RPG Dark Brotherhood. The copyright holder didnt like this and filed suit. Initially everyone laughed about it, until he won. He made an offer to SEGA and Archie concerning his material that SEGA both could not and refused to take. They informed Archie (whom lost the paperwork that allowed the artist to file his copyright claims in the first place) that Archie had to do something about the situation, then Archie rebooted the series. Then SEGA sent over the mandate list outlining what Archie can and cant do with the Sonic series (I wrote it out in another post).  As previously stated, all of the copyright material is off limits. The characters you named are ALL part of that group so... they arent coming back. They might have new characters that vaguely remind you of them, but they are all toast.  Knuckles series was especially confusing. I have heard it was one of the better parts of the entire comic franchise, though...  The comic you are referring to is StH 23... WAaaaaay back in the day! I had that issue too!"

I admit the love triangles, rhombuses etc were getting dumb, but I really really wanted to see how some of the core FF stories got resolved (Namely Antoine, Bunny, Nicole, and of course Mecha Sally)  Between Sega mandates and management I think we will have to put up with lighter stories for the time being :\"

SonicTheHedgehog,39cw9m,Galrowre,5,Wed Jun 10 22:48:29 2015 UTC,I remember doing it a different way back in the genesis.  I would get the emeralds on the first stage. Do a soft reset. And just do first stage again. Emeralds would stay with you.

SonicTheHedgehog,39cw9m,BluntHeart,3,Thu Jun 11 12:58:20 2015 UTC,"Hitting the reset button. A hard reset is turning off the system and turning it back on again.  Apparently Sonic 2 doesn't re-initialize the part of RAM that stores chaos emerald information, so just hitting the reset button lets you collect all seven emeralds from the very first star post."
SonicTheHedgehog,39cw9m,VyseofArcadia,1 point,Thu Jun 11 13:56:37 2015 UTC,Soft reset is when you reset the console but not completely turn it off.   Instead of pressing the left button to hard reset (turn the system completely off) you just soft reset (Restart the system pressing the right button).  It stores your chaos emeralds that you've collected. Making it easier to acquire them. That's how I would get them all besides the cheat lol.
SonicTheHedgehog,39cw9m,MrkJulio,3,Thu Jun 11 19:18:03 2015 UTC,"I've always been horrible at special stages, no matter what game, I'd have to use save states to get this, but that's pretty amazing."

SonicTheHedgehog,396guu,viceroyofmontecristo,9,Tue Jun 9 19:02:55 2015 UTC,"Call me weird, but I like this mechanic. For years, the community has been split by the argument of ""sonic is about challenging platforming"" or ""sonic is about speed and controlling momentum"".  By try looks of it, fire quells the first side. Some puzzles (stick's boomerang) and other challenges would be implemented with fire.  Meanwhile, it seems like equipping ice makes you faster. An infinite sonic rush style boost  And honestly, the cartoon is decent. It gives Amy more character than she's had in years, and has that sonic colors charm. The game sticking to the boom theme isn't necessarily a damnation. I think this is their chance to make things right."

SonicTheHedgehog,396guu,Amigonigro,7,Tue Jun 9 19:02:59 2015 UTC,"We had Heroes, 06, and Unleashed; people were just too stubborn to look past the titles to notice that they were all Adventure-style."
SonicTheHedgehog,396guu,Sea-Salt,5,Tue Jun 9 22:23:37 2015 UTC,"Can't really argue with 06 unfortunately, but Heroes and Unleashed are incredibly far removed from the Adventure games. In Heroes, Sonic is bound to his teammates which prevents him from acting the way he does on his own in the Adventure games, and the Unleashed day stages are an entirely different type of game altogether. Playing as Sonic in the Adventure games was focused around rolling and platforming. It was the closest thing we got to the Genesis games in 3D. Heroes replaced rolling and the spindash with the ""rocket accelerate"" move which really only looked like rolling and the presence of a flying character dramatically altered the platforming. Unleashed forgo-ed momentum-based gameplay entirely for the boost and boost gauge, and traditional platforming was rare and mostly replaced with reactionary jumps.  We only had one game that vaguely resembled an Adventure game past the Adventure games and that was Sonic 06, large in part because 06 was a major retooling of the first Sonic Adventure. I hope you can see why we don't consider that title to be a worthy sequel without any explanation."
SonicTheHedgehog,396guu,88MilesPrower,1 point,Wed Jun 10 03:40:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's why I've always said if they do release SA3 I'd be like ""Nope, sorry, there was that one game that was kind of similar to this remember?"" and walk away."
SonicTheHedgehog,396guu,StandupGaming,0,Tue Jun 9 23:42:07 2015 UTC,"Unleashed  Adventure-style   HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! The only thing that was anything like an SA3 was Werehog, which sucked. You'd be better off comparing Generations to Adventure, at least that had two good gameplay styles instead of one good one and one crappy one, plus the level designs in Modern came a bit closer to Adventure than Unleashed did.   06    A GOOD Adventure-styled Sonic game."
SonicTheHedgehog,396guu,KFCNyanCat,3,Wed Jun 10 01:37:58 2015 UTC,"Quality aside, those games were very similar in style to the Adventure games.  All of them gave us multiple playable characters (werehog should be considered a separate character due to the brawling playstyle), and both 06 and Unleashed gave us hubs not unlike the Adventure Fields of SA1.  Plus, all of these games are more story-driven and dip into darker themes.  I'm not really sure what fills your quota for what makes an Adventure-style game, but quite a few checkboxes are marked off here."
SonicTheHedgehog,396guu,Sea-Salt,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:59:34 2015 UTC,"I mean the way it plays; the gameplay being focused on momentum, the stages having lots of platforming , and the alternate gameplay styles. I consider '06 an Adventure style game (just not a good one,) and Heroes is definitely similar, but Unleashed, outside of the Adventure Fields and the inclusion of two gameplay styles, it's not much like Adventure."
SonicTheHedgehog,396guu,KFCNyanCat,0,Wed Jun 10 19:53:38 2015 UTC,"Sonic Battle was Adventure-style based on those guidelines. So was Sonic Chronicles, and since you count separate gameplays as separate characters so was Generations. Sonic 3 & Knuckles, Sonic Advance 3, Sonic Rush, Sonic and the Black Knight, and Sonic Boom meet most of these requirements, you're describing basic qualities of a Sonic game.  The only game I would say is inherently Adventure style is 06, and while that game is very adventure style it still doesn't mean anything. Sonic 3 had more in common with Sonic Advance than it did with Sonic 4, which by your logic should be renamed Sonic 10. People want Sega to make a new Adventure game, and the fact that 06 was similar in spirit doesn't invalidate that."
SonicTheHedgehog,396guu,StandupGaming,3,Wed Jun 10 08:03:55 2015 UTC,Just give me Chao again. I don't care how they do it.

SonicTheHedgehog,396guu,Amigonigro,3,Tue Jun 9 19:20:13 2015 UTC,Why do people like Chao? It's literally the least sonic-like thing in a Sonic game. It's also stupid and boring.
SonicTheHedgehog,396guu,morphinapg,3,Wed Jun 10 02:51:45 2015 UTC,Because you got to make and race/battle your own personal chao

SonicTheHedgehog,396guu,morphinapg,1 point,Wed Jun 10 12:10:16 2015 UTC,"That's... actually a fair complaint. I'll still stick to what I've said, though. Besides, it's just a minigame that you can leave aside.  Perhaps Sega could make the Chao-related stuff into a separate franchise from Sonic, like Ubisoft when they separated Rayman from Rabbids, and then make Chao games for mobiles or some shit. Don't mind me though, I'm just thinking out loud at this point."
SonicTheHedgehog,396guu,hermitowl,2,Wed Jun 10 16:57:34 2015 UTC,"Btw, Sonic Team apparently first experimented with the same idea in Nights Into Dreams on the Saturn. There was an ""A-life"" feature in that game. Less complex, but still you can see its early roots there. Seems like it was most likely a side project people at Sonic Team were doing and they just decided to start throwing it into their games with no rhyme or reason."
SonicTheHedgehog,396guu,morphinapg,0,Wed Jun 10 21:23:46 2015 UTC,"They fit just fine, they're designed to give you a break from the fast paced action levels every now and then and do something more casual, but they were also designed so people who don't enjoy the casual can safely ignore them, it's not like they really took anything from the game."

Sonic Boom didn't exactly do any favors for the franchise, especially with Rise of Lyric. But I'm glad to see that they're not just trying to sweep the spin-off under the rug, and are moving ahead with making it an ongoing series.  Who knows, maybe this will keep the cartoon going, which is arguably the best thing about this canon.  And honestly, both the Sonic fanbase and the general gaming community are going to bitch and moan regardless. The fanbase will never agree on what they want, and gaming journalists will always use the blue blur as a punching bag for easy clicks.  So, you go, Sega! This is a big ol' healthy middle finger to the haters that says ""Can you spare a fuck to give? Because I ran out of them a long time ago."""

SonicTheHedgehog,396guu,Burtzman,3,Tue Jun 9 21:13:33 2015 UTC,You did a full review......of a demo?
SonicTheHedgehog,396guu,Notpoe779,-1,Tue Jun 9 21:39:11 2015 UTC,"Alright i should probably get this started  Sonic Boom: Shattered Crystal Demo for 3DS Review  Yeah it's bad  but not that bad  but remember, this is a reboot, things are going to be different will it be something groundbreaking that'll revive the series?  the short answer is no  Gameplay: 5/10  It's boring, which is sad because it seems interesting when you TALK about it, being able to switch between the 4 characters on the fly is kinda cool, and each of them is unique, sorta. but, well, the game play, is not what you are used to, by any means.  this game, feels sluggish, at first. in all honesty, once you get the hang of the controls it's not to bad. but it is NOT fast, it feels fast sometimes, which is nice, but, overall it's not, if anything it feels like what i expected Spyro Orange to be like, but worse. overall, the main levels have no flow to them, you'll need to be fast one second and then slow down another, hence why the dash function is mapped to a button. This isn't too bad, but when you have to use a special move, consider the flow completely broken. on top of that, the level works like a fat maze, which is ungodly amounts of annoying, even with the map provided.  the 2 other level types are race and a tunnel level ok so, race is fun, if the entire game had been like it there'd be a lot less hate, i don't have much to say about it, i did enjoy it to an extent  the tunnel level, was actually, pretty freaking cool, but lame at the same time, it's basically a simplified version of the old special stages from rush, colors on DS, and similar special stages in the series. except you are on a track. you can boost like in past titles,   but you can't switch tracks while boosting  which is stupid, and breaks the flow of these stages  despite all that, i actually did replay and complete all three goals on the tunnel stage, so i can't say i didn't enjoy it.  the last thing is what i can only assume was a minigame, I found it in the standard level and i had to play as tails to even access it.  It was boring, had a cool idea, but over all boring.  The coolest thing in it was touching the bottom screen to cause a radar affect revealing the map and my goal. that is it  Visuals: 7.5/10  Honestly? Not bad, i'm a bit impressed even, stuff is bright and colorful, but, it lacks the quality that some of the 3DS's first party titles have, like Super Smash Bros. and Super Mario 3D Land. But i will be honest. The Map screen in the demo is GORGEOUS and very interesting, too bad it's a facade, but immersion is there a bit which is nice to see, being near water allows you to hear it and being near a jungle area lets you hear jungle sounds. I realize that's a bit more a of a sound than a visual thing, but it really affected how i perceived the visuals, and overall made it a bit more pleasant, i think i enjoyed the map the most outta the whole game.  Sounds: 1/10  Bland. As. Fuck. I don't even have anything to say other than they leave absolutely no impact, even a sound i thought was going to be cool ended up being lame (it was the sound for grinding with the grapple beam in the tunnel level) However there was one thing that stood out to me  The sounds for the menu are fucking cool, if the whole game had had sounds of this caliber it'd been a 8.5/10 easily. Even the animation for pausing and bringing up the menu is cool.  Music: 0/10  This.  This is an embarrassment. if there is one thing, ONE THING reputable about the sonic series, it is the music, even in absolutely god awful titles like Free Riders and 2006, the music is still good and it's really what i think kept the fans coming back for so long, i have a ton of sonic game soundtracks, so that should really say something.  But this...  this has got to be hands down some of the blandest music i have heard in my entire life. It's boring, bland, and 100% forgettable. There is absolutely nothing to defend in this department, period.  Overall Score  Sonic Boom: Shattered Crystal  3.375/10  I can't recommend this game to an actual gamer, or even a sonic fan really. but  I would recommend it to an 8-10 year old. the game is playable, and it is finished, it just lacks inspiration, and since this is the first time i have ever heard of the studio that made it, im going to assume it's their fault  but it's still segas fault  i can't help but feel if sonic team had made this game, it would've been way better, and it's sega's fault for trusting their flagship franchise in the hands of these people  notice how recently they've been trusting shitty companies a lot?   they trusted GearBox with Alien: Colonial Marines, and we all know how that turned out  just wtf is going on over there?"

I don't even know why that game of all games was brought up, because it is the ""worst""? Well I think 06 is better because it actually feels like a Sonic game. Also there are more playable characters and loading times has nothing to do with game play. I get it, Sonic 06 is evil or whatever, but it has it's moments, so does Sonic Boom I guess. Also they do have some similar mechanics, like enemies you can't just kill with a homing attack. But overall, Sonic 06 and Boom felt slow but, 06 was not only cooler, it had a lot more content, we had 14 levels in boom and, among all of them, over 27, plus, Boom is way more childish."
SonicTheHedgehog,396guu,hermitowl,1 point,Thu Jun 11 09:26:32 2015 UTC,"Well I think 06 is better because it actually feels like a Sonic game.   I find this complaint against Sonic Boom to be pretty pointless. Sonic Boom was announced as a spinoff since the beginning, and as such, it had the right to be its own thing separated from the main Sonic games. Granted, the way it was implemented was pretty lackluster, but I still find it to be more efficient in being a spinoff game than Sonic 06 being a good main series game.   Boom is way more childish   Meh. I don't see that as a problem, really. If the story is good, who cares if it is childish, serious, something on between or whatever. My main complaint with the stories in both games is that they're pretty much weak. I just give the winning edge to Boom because every playable character had some focus (unlike 06, which treated Tails, Knuckles, Blaze, etc. as background characters), and wasn't as pretentious and unnecessarily bleak. Also, it didn't have Elize. Fuck Elize. The only new thing I liked about 06 was Silver. Poor bastard didn't have a chance to return yet.  Just my two cents, though. I didn't intend any ill against your opinion, I was just curious.  Also...   I don't even know why that game of all games was brought up, because it is the ""worst""?   Well, because you said that only Blaze could save this game. Thing is it didn't save Sonic 06 from its infamy.  EDIT: added some words."

Also if Sonic Boom is truly a spinoff like they said, why is it getting 2 consecutive console installments?   My bet is they really want people to like Boom, after the TV show's relative success. And I'd bet they began developing Fire and Ice when they weren't counting on RoL's backlash.  EDIT: Also, the 25th anniversary is just around the corner. I doubt Sega would be so heartless to the point of forgetting Sonic's origins. Let's wait and see."

SonicTheHedgehog,395opo,Douche_Baguette,4,Tue Jun 9 14:02:14 2015 UTC,"Generations was ""only 50% 2D""? Yeah, Modern Sonic was.  OK, sarcasm mode over. I'll be honest; while I do agree with his criticisms, I don't entirely agree with all of the solutions:   Age range being 18-30. It won't work. Look at Sonic's main rival Mario: That franchise has been around much longer and yet the games haven't really changed in what their potential audience is, in fact I would argue that it's sort of gone down in target demographics (at least the minimum end of that spectrum) and yet those games still sell well. Maybe it's because Mario hasn't had a game on the same reception level as say, 06 (which let's be honest, was when the problems really started showing - Shadow may have been mixed, but it wasn't ""hated"" as much as 06) and therefore hasn't had to deal with what Sonic's been going through these last few years, we can only speculate. My solution would definitely be to bring the target demographic up, but not 18-30; 12-and-up's a fair range if you ask me. The art style suggested is, in my opinion, too radical of a change - a little ""fan-art""y for my tastes. I mean, the Classic and Adventure designs had a consistent style between them, and even post-Adventure and Boom are at least reminiscent of those. Keep it how it is, and I'm sure Sonic'll be fine. The art style is not something SEGA should worry about. Gameplay - With regards to his comment about speed, I'm going to say this as clear as as I can: Sonic has never been about Speed. Well, let me rephrase that before I get crucified for suggesting such a ridiculous notion: Sonic has never just been about speed. Look at Sonic 1: Sure, it's got its fast sections, but for the most part, it's slow platforming. Sonic 2 and Sonic 3&K refined (and dare I say, perfected) it, but it was still a combination of fast and slow. You could just blaze through the level with no thought, but you miss out on a million secrets (How else do you expect to get Super and Hyper forms in Sonic 3&K?). With that out of the way: 2D-only - sorry no, I disagree. I may appreciate the Classic games for what they are, but in my own honest opinion, they do not belong in a 2015/2016 Sonic game. He may say that ""Sonic hasn't worked in 3D"" and while he might technically be right, what's actually happened is that 3D stages need certain things, and while the 3D Sonic titles have ticked some of those boxes with each release, no game has ticked all of them at once: * Sonic Adventure 1: Good - Massive, wide open levels with ability to explore for hidden secrets, making you feel like you were in a part of the environment around you Bad - No level truly takes into account each character's different style of gameplay * Sonic Adventure 2: Good - Each level solely built around each character - Sonic/Shadow's levels are made for running fast, Tails/Eggman are made for mech-shooting and slower platforming, Knuckles/Rouge are made for treasure hunting Bad - Each level is extremely linear (Sonic/Shadow and Tails/Eggman) Bad - Each level is very mazelike and does require some knowledge (Knuckles/Rouge only), however: Good - Knuckles/Rouge's levels recognise and address this by having 3-4 distinct areas in each level, with one Emerald Shard per area (Sure, you can sort of only find them in a specific order, but find them out of sequence and you get a higher score, improving your chance of an A ranking) * Sonic Heroes: Good - Massive, wide open levels once more, each built around different styles of gameplay Bad - Again, very linear, very few secrets, certain formations are required in certain sections I could go on, but for the sake of this post already getting huge, I'll stop here. Really, what a ""good 3D Sonic game"" is, is something that fills the ""Good"" criteria and addresses the ""Bad"" by either fixing the issues, or not including them at all: Stages that are wide-open, have the potential to hide secrets, are each based around one or two characters' styles of gameplay (for example, have Sonic and Tails in one level, then Tails and Knuckles in another, then Sonic on his own in the next), and have multiple paths to them so it's not like some simple obstacle course. ...Saying that, I do think that some of the 2D gameplay suggestions he made were, to be honest, kinda cool. Again, I don't believe that Sonic belongs in the 2D realm anymore, so unless those can translate into 3D just as well, one might have to leave it on the side. Although the whole ""backpack"" mechanic... no, I think that would slow down the game a little too much. I know I already said ""Sonic isn't just about speed"", but like it or not, speed is definitely a cornerstone of Sonic. With the other stuff like changing Sonic's personality and removing the voice-acting - I think, like the art style, it's a case of ""too far gone to turn back"". With further regards the former of those two, Sonic as a character is fine how he is - just tweak it to fit the seriousness of the story and you're good to go (although saying that, I kind of prefer Fleetway's imagining of Sonic: heroic, cocky.. but also kind of a dick at times and likes to rush into things without thinking; not a straight-up arsehole, just doesn't know his cockiness limits).   I could go on, but I've been waffling for ages and chances are most folk will have glanced over this massive wall of text.  tl;dr: bold stuff at top"

Someone actually called out SA2 on their linear bullshit. You sir, are getting an upvote.  I don't agree with all of your points, but I do agree with some of them (especially around the character design and lore). However, there is one point I will argue and that is demographics: While Mario has always been focused on children, the franchise has often been aimed to appeal to the whole family through charm, humor, and a very safe and parent friendly environment. It's sorta like Sesame Street: Your kids will love it and learn something, but they have features that appeal to parents and older siblings too.  Meanwhile, since 1991, Sonic has always targeted the youth, though how young the target depended on the reigon: Japan put Sonic on the same rank of Mario with a slightly cooler attitude, while America and Europe aimed towards older teenagers with a Sonic with a more pronounced attitude. It wasn't until SEGA started marketing the nostalgia of the classic games where I saw them thinking about adults.  I'm not saying I agree with Jabed's idea of only appealing to nostalgiafags, but SEGA should realize that the bulk of their vocal and loyal consumers fall around the 18-30 yr old demographic. So instead of taking one road or the other, SEGA should try for a periphery demographic.   Look at any modern animated film from a major studio and chances are, you'll find a film the whole family enjoy, with tons of subtle references for adults. The only animated films that are squarely aimed at kids tend to suck or only do good at the box office through other circumstances. Ratchet and Clank is aimed around a similar demographic as Sonic but their more sophisticated sense of humor and rapid shooting action style makes the series just as appealing to adults. The best example of a more sophisticated Sonic is practically the Archie Comic, especially written by Ian Flynn. It's still Sonic, but just far more fleshed out and flexible, without any of the bullshit drama from the Penders years.  For Sonic to once again be an appealing figure to the mainstream, I think he can still be a speedy hedgehog with a cocky attitude, but in a more modern style than the dated 90's cool he thinks he is."
SonicTheHedgehog,395opo,C-Abdulio,2,Fri Jun 12 08:20:19 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't personally say SA2's linear level design to be ""bullshit""; a bit of a bummer maybe, but it never ruined the overall experience for me. I would say it's on the same sort of page as the original Crash Bandicoot trilogy: a linear obstacle course yes, but it was never boring. Would I have wanted more exploration in the levels? Of course; I would argue that Sonic '06, despite its flaws, had better level design. But for what we got, 12-year-old me was satisfied. Saying that, SA2 is still my favourite game in the series (it was the game that got me back into Sonic), so that might be a factor into the whole thing. It's not a ""perfect"" Sonic game, but for me, it had gotten more of the most important things right than the other games in the series in my opinion: at least the gameplay and the core level design worked together, which is a plus in my book."
SonicTheHedgehog,395opo,neohylanmay,2,Fri Jun 12 09:04:24 2015 UTC,"Such a brilliant video. I have not been keeping up with this franchise at all for a pretty long time, the last Sonic game I recall playing through is Sonic Rush, which I definitly enjoyed. From what I've played of Generations, the 3D sections were cool but nothing mind blowing, and the 2D part of the game felt a lot more solid to me overall. After watching through that video I'd more than love to play a Sonic game that takes a similar approach to what he suggested, remove this goofy ""cool"" attitude that is made fun of so much nowadays and give us more focussed gameplay. Absolutely love the idea of making the main character more ""vulnerable"" aswell. Sorry about this unnecessarily huge post. :)"

While I don't think Sega should abandon 3D altogether, as I've actually enjoyed many of Sonic's 3D outings, I do think that having a series of high quality 2D games is not a bad idea. Sonic 4 was a good idea, just poorly executed, though to give credit where credit is due, they did step up their game for episode 2.  Some of his ideas for redesign make the character not feel like Sonic anymore, giving him a more cautious, vulnerable personality just isn't Sonic, and the whole idea of making him a ""blank slate"" is a big no no. Sonic's personality and expressiveness are part of what set him apart from Mario.   The art style too is a little too much of a departure. Whilr I'm all for a new look, (I'm one of those weirdos who really likes the Boom designs) I don't think something that drastic is needed. It again makes Sonic feel less like Sonic.  I like the idea of the backpack, just not really for Sonic. If that mechanic were introduced with an original character, I'd be all for it.  Here's the part I freaking loved, his idea for Sonic's attacks. The idea that Sonic doesn't spin right away when he jumps. Pressing different buttons while jumping will cause him to do various attacks, love it, love everything about it.  As far as the voice acting, again, I don't think that Sega should abandon it altogether, but I do think having it absent in a game or two wouldn't hurt. I look at Rayman Origins/Legends, minimal voice acting, but you knew what was going on and why, for the most part. Show don't tell.  Tl;dr I agree with some of the things he said but not all, don't like his redesign, love his idea for Sonic's attacks, think his backpack idea is good, just not necessarily for Sonic."
SonicTheHedgehog,395opo,OberonTheGoat,1 point,Fri Jun 19 04:15:17 2015 UTC,"I think the idea of a 3D Sonic could work  if the worlds were vast enough to support the speed. Instead of making open worlds be a janky hub, focus on making open worlds the actual level themselves.  Look at the first four Marios and compare them to 64. The first 4 games were essentially about getting to the end of the stage without dying. Mario 64 plopped you into a nonlinear 3D environment and told you to find the star.  Sonic never stopped being about getting to the end of the stage essentially making the 3D games the same linear experience as the past 2D ones."

SonicTheHedgehog,395opo,LobotomyTH,-4,Wed Jun 10 02:31:26 2015 UTC,"I think Sonic could do with a decent reboot and re-design. One idea I had for a potential Sonic series is something I'll just call Blue Streak.  It is a game set 12 years after the events of Sonic 3 & Knuckles that introduces an alternate universe to the later Sonic games. With the implied death of Doctor Ivo Robotnik, Sonic, Tails and Knuckles soon go their separate ways and grow up into adulthood within a peaceful Mobius.  Tails becomes a world-renowned scientist, Sonic marries Amy Rose and raises a son named Pace (who looks like a much younger version of Classic Sonic from Sonic Generations) and Knuckles returns to his duty of guarding the Master Emerald, becoming a staunch guardian in the process.  The initial levels are tied around the ordinary lives of these three characters, until Robotnik returns and the plot gets far more sinister and dark from there. In fact, he's far more evil in Blue Streak than in SatAM, and he even makes Lord Brevon from Freedom Planet look like a pussy."

It actually felt like platforming, whereas the day stages were more of a roller-coaster. The thing that made me dislike them eventually was the same godawful circus jazz music playing EVERY. SINGLE. TIME you got into a fight. It was like hearing that Benny Hills theme on every other 'funny' YouTube video. I actually even liked it in the beginning but after hundreds of fights it was just like nails grating over a chalkboard and it ruined the entire gameplay for me."
SonicTheHedgehog,39465e,angryzor,2,Tue Jun 9 06:22:04 2015 UTC,"I hated, HATED the Werehog stages. I had the worst time with them, getting through the whole game. Once I was finished with it, and the game, I moved on slightly satisfied with the game as whole thanks in part for the day stages. One day I decide to go back for Achievements (xbox 360) and collectables. I started spending more time with the Night stages to look for everything and really learn the combos. Once I completed everything, I loved the Night stages. The combos can be satisfying, especially when you active that Unleashed mode. Tearing things apart is wonderful. Of course I only learned how to play as him after I did that Wentos trick to get unlimited rings and buy all the steaks I needed to increase Sonic's levels to max. Which really helped with the Werehog parts. If I took the time to learn to play as him from the beginning instead of trying to rush through everything like it was a normal Sonic stage, I would have enjoyed it more at the start.     My only complaints after all this was that could have easily been a Knuckles gameplay mechanic, the way the same music would would play EVERY TIME you went into battle, instead of a more hyped up version of the stage music and a simple grammar/localization issue! Also ""Werehog""  From wikipedia:    The word werewolf continues a late Old English wer(e)wulf, a compound of were ""adult male human"" and wulf ""wolf"".    So it would be Sonic the Human Hog :)    Oh and we got this really cool movie that I wish they would make more of"

So it would be Sonic the Human Hog :)    That's such a silly thing that every wannabe linguist wants to point out (nothing against you personally!). Yes, ""were"" used to mean ""man"", but:   Language changes. ""Terrific"" for example used to mean ""causing terror"", nowadays it's used as ""extraordinary, great"". Pretty much the same for ""awesome"". ""Literally"" is more and more used as ""figuratively"", and so on... ""Were"" has simply become a prefix for ""transformation into altered state, akin to man and werewolf"". The word ""werehog"" existed and was used at least a decade before Unleashed, if not longer. Sonic is an anthropomorphic hedgehog, thus he's a ""werehog"" by default, if you want to be literal. The English word ""hedgehog"" is a compound noun itself: hedge + hog. So, Sonic is a bush pig, haha! No. That's not how it works. As fun as it can be, compounds are not split into parts which are then translated individually. The whole is more than the sum of its parts, you could say. The Japanese word for hedgehog is ""harinezumi"", by the way. Also a compound: hari = needle, nezumi = mouse or rat (hence Erazor Djinn calling Sonic a rat in Secret Rings). The legend goes that Sonic's original name was ""Mr. Needlemouse"", but that's incorrect, it actually was Mr. Harinezumi, i.e. Mr. Hedgehog."

Other than that, rather enjoyable."
SonicTheHedgehog,39465e,sonicspeed1500,2,Tue Jun 9 10:45:42 2015 UTC,"I liked the werehog stages but I love brawlers and platformers as well as traditional sonic gameplay so Unleashed was a win/win for me.

SonicTheHedgehog,39465e,thedreamisblue,1 point,Tue Jun 9 12:41:16 2015 UTC,"Yes, the Werehog wasn't that bad at all. Though it has some big flaws that people have already pointed out:   Battle music gets annoying quickly. There should have been an option to disable it. The stage music is great, but you can hardly enjoy it because it gets interrupted so frequently. The stages are a tad too long. Balancing on beams that can't be grabbed, over bottomless pits, sucks hard. Particularly those spiked beams that practically insta-kill you when you make a tiny mistake. This is probably my biggest gripe about the Werehog.   Some useful things that everybody should know, making life as the Werehog a bit easier:   While platforming, you can pre-emptively hold the B button (circle on PS3) instead of waiting for a target reticle to show up! That'll drastically lower the risk of missing grabs while jumping. Pour all experience points into the Werehog first, even the points gathered in daytime levels (some people don't realize you can switch between Sonic and Werehog on the EXP screen). Primarily level up combat (learns new combos), strength, and life. Try all combos (see list in pause menu) and find out what's fun and what works best against certain enemies. Blocking in combat can be more useful than you might think. Try it. And be aware that while in ""unleashed"" mode, you practically have infinite shields, i.e. you can block even the strongest attacks! NB for the Wii/PS2 version: blocking makes the Werehog stop on a dime, can be useful in the slippery ice levels. Finish bigger enemies with QTEs to get a lot more points. Once an enemy is low on health, a certain icon will float above them; to initiate the finisher QTE, step close and press the grab button (B/circle). However, the more health an enemy still has, the more difficult the QTE will be, so wear their health down to an acceptable level first. If you mess up the QTE, not only will you lose health, but the enemy will regain some. You can gain experience points by eating food. Some food gives more EXP than others (I think Hero Sandwiches were best). Once you have befriended Wentos, the travelling salesman, you can abuse him to increase your ring count, and then use those rings to buy more food for EXP. Basically, Wentos occasionally (not always!) sells you a specific item that you can sell back to him at a higher price! If you have enough rings, also buy souvenirs and bring them to professor Pickle, he'll give you sun and moon medals for them."

The HD version doesn't, but it works there, too.  There are two powerup items that give Sonic an aura. One looks like a shield and gives a green aura. It temporarily increases defense, i.e. reduces damage taken from enemies. The other looks like a claw and gives an orange aura. It temporarily increases offense, i.e. increases damage dealt to enemies. The unleashed mode is more or less a combination of both, I think."

SonicTheHedgehog,38xgii,Goodbye18000,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:30:37 2015 UTC,"The Silver arc was pretty good, and probably one of the darkest stories of the entire series (or at least dark in a way that fits it). Plus it might have the best art in the entire Universe series thus far (not that the rest is terrible). It was also interesting to learn that the entire arc was a love letter to Ian Flynn's younger years, as it's heavily inspired by the fancomic ""Other M"".  I also was a fan of Lockdown, which was the one dealing with Scourge and his crew escaping the Zone Jail. It actually made Scourge, Fiona, and the Destructix likable, and seeing as how everyone involved would soon be made unusable in the comics, was a nice send-off to them."

SonicTheHedgehog,38xgii,Hunterhedgehog,1 point,Mon Jun 8 01:39:18 2015 UTC,"May not be the answer you're looking for, but ""Robotnik Reigns Supreme"" is one of my favourite story arc in the Fleetway comic because it starts off as something completely different (I believe that it technically started during the ""Hobson & Choy"" mini-arc and just evolved from there) and ending turning into one of the darkest story arcs in the comic thus far (not as dark as say ""Chaos"", but definitely up there)"

But as far as Fleetway goes, definitely check it out. I would start at Issue 6 (when they brought in a proper continuity and not just a series of one-offs) and then once the Sonic Adventure 1 adaptation ends (Issue 185 I think?), jump straight to the ""Unofficially Official"" fan-continuation Sonic the Comic Online - all the issues between are just reprints of older strips (executive decision, nothing to do with the writers unfortunately)."

SonicTheHedgehog,38vwvi,cobysev,3,Mon Jun 8 00:43:31 2015 UTC,"Not all games go with the greedy dlc  scheme of taking away game content and making you pay for it... actually almost ALL Nintendo games with DLC is completely extra and after the fact, not to mention a good portion of it is completely free (like with splatoon). As for other game companies, I cannot speak, but don't use blanket statements like that. Best to do some research first.   I do agree however, that on disc DLC and/or removed content (aka day one DLC) is bullcrap and doesn't need to exist at all. Free updates are fine, but cut content isn't."
SonicTheHedgehog,38vwvi,rriillyy,-1,Sun Jun 7 09:39:51 2015 UTC,"I'm not just referring to cut content as DLC. As I mentioned in another comment here, I'm a completist and it pisses me off when additional content comes out and I can't play it without spending even more than the $60+ I already spent on the game itself. I feel like I'm missing out on another fun aspect of the game. But if I indulge in DLC for one game, I'll need to check it out in all my games. And suddenly, that $1.99+ DLC starts adding up over time. Before I know it, I've blown a few hundred dollars on games I already own.  It's the same reason I never spend money on games for my phone. Once you allow yourself to spend a few bucks for in-game content, then you start justifying to yourself how it's okay to spend a little more next time. It adds up over time to a lot of wasted money for something you don't really need."
SonicTheHedgehog,38vwvi,cobysev,1 point,Sun Jun 7 10:19:48 2015 UTC,"DLC in itself is fine. A game and engine can be good, and if the developer wants to work on some extra levels after release and charge a couple bucks for it, there's nothing wrong with that. The problem comes where publishers put 'DLC' on the disc and charge extra to access this content, or do dirty deals with season passes where people are paying for content that hasn't been created yet, stopping consumers from being able to make an informed decision about the quality of the content."
SonicTheHedgehog,38vwvi,shinaku,0,Sun Jun 7 10:38:37 2015 UTC,"I'm a completist, so DLC is my biggest pet peeve of gaming. So I just beat a game and you're now telling me I need to spend more money to play all the content associated with it? I just got gouged with the $60 price tag for this game; I'm not spending even more to satiate my completist compulsion.  So no, DLC is the devil, Bobby Boucher. I don't want to see my Sonic games adopt that horrid culture of acceptance. Games are expensive enough as it is for a much more reduced gameplay than we used to get. They're not going to squeeze even more money out of me for maybe another hour or two of entertainment. Now if they want to release them for free, that's another story..."
SonicTheHedgehog,38vwvi,cobysev,1 point,Sun Jun 7 10:03:14 2015 UTC,"No. DLC is necessary for extra additions that were meant to be added, but were cut due to time constraints. Take SSB for Wii U for example. Thanks to DLC, we now can play as Mewtwo, Lucas, Roy, hopefully Wolf and one of the Ice Climbers, as well as DLC newcombers like Ryu, and hopefully NiGHTS and Klonoa. Plus extra stages. DLC is perfect for SSB."

There's no glitches, the game looks friggin' gorgeous even today, and the daytime stages finally get 3D Sonic gameplay right, and the rest of the series has built upon what this introduced. You can really tell that Sonic Team wanted to make up for the previous game."
SonicTheHedgehog,38ixya,Sea-Salt,6,Thu Jun 4 16:14:47 2015 UTC,"IMO Unleashed showed us the best boosting gameplay there can be, if you remove the night stages then it might just be the best 3D Sonic game.

It just had the bad luck of being the next game after Sonic 06, and was of course nitpicked on by game journalists who use the series as an easy punching-bag.  And new or used copies run you $15-20, so it's not like you're losing out on too much money if you don't like it.

Me and my brother played the hell out of it back in the day, but upon playing it again in the Gems Collection, it just all sinks in.  Wouldn't mind a modern take on it that, since on-foot racing isn't a very plentiful genre. But the original game is really best in the past.  Music's still great, though.

Though from seeing videos, I don't think the experience would be quite the same without the arcade cabinet.  It seems a lot of the difficulty comes from the fact that a trackball isn't the easiest type of controller to work with. Without that, you could very well beat this game in less than 10 minutes.  Still, I guess it is odd that it was never included in any compilation, at least for the sake of having a piece of Sonic history."

The entire game was like the speed stages in the Sonic Adventure games (the best stages, even though the others aren't bad [save for fishing and SA2 emerald hunting]) in the Heroes engine, the shooting worked well, vehicles suck but you rarely use vehicles, and the stage designs were mostly good (no Sonic game was perfect in this department, not 1 nor 3K nor Adventure nor Generations.)"

They're basically the alien stereotype where they come to Earth to fuck shit up. That's it. Finding out that Shadow was born out of alien-DNA doesn't help either. The mission structure of Shadow the Hedgehog is among the worst examples I've ever seen in any game. The ""what-if"" scenarios at the end of every campaign, from Hero to Dark, are so underwhelming that they don't justify having to backpedal through the levels in order to reach those endings. And the fact that there's a final story campaign nullifies the ""Hero or Renegade?"" sort of thing that the game was advertising. It wouldn't seem like such a cheap way to add replayabilty value to SoH if you didn't have to repeat the first level TEN. FUCKING. TIMES!   Just my two cents, though."

SonicTheHedgehog,38ixya,sorin255,1 point,Sat Jun 13 23:24:18 2015 UTC,"I'm aware you didn't mention the story. I just mentioned it because it really is a freaking peeve of mine. To me, it's a proof of why Sonic Team is pretty hit-or-miss (more miss, imo) in writing stories. Especially serious stories.  As for the mission structure, I think I'd grow tired of being obligated to repeat the level ten times, even when playing the game for more than one day.   And it's not like Shadow the Hedgehog is like Sonic Adventure 1, where the stage adapts itself to the playstyle of the character currently being played with (e.g.: the first part of Red Mountain being adapted to both Sonic's and Knuckles' playstyle, or Hot Shelter's second part being adapted to both Amy's and Gamma's playstyle); it's the same thing over and over with Metropolis. For ten times, nonetheless!   Furthermore, there's the part when you backpedal through each and every level to kill every alien/soldier/whatever, without some sort of localizing them and only resorting to the checkpoints. And personally, I really don't see the appeal on that.  EDIT:   This one comes down to personal preference; I'd see this being annoying if I was trying to complete the game in one day, but I believe the game wasn't designed with that in mind.   I don't buy that argument. A game should convince you to play it, regardless of the player completing in only one day, or more. And one of Shadow the Hedgehog's main appointed flaws is that the game is severely repetitive."

SonicTheHedgehog,38ixya,YoYoFantaFanta,3,Sat Jun 6 00:49:10 2015 UTC,"Yes! I agree too. While it's certainly not the best Sonic game, it's still a good game. Instead of taking it like it was meant to be, its better to take it as it is: an open-world adventure game, with some running segments, a few vehicle segments, and some psychokinesis segments that were hard to control. The music was great. The graphics were all right (the Soleanna Forest, not sure if I got the name right, had some nice looking trees and grass). There were those glitches, such as the endless fights with Silver, the occasional getting stuck in a corner and countless others. Overall, I enjoyed it rather than suffer like some YouTube reviewers love to do. I mean, it's a game, not a chore. If you're not having fun, then don't play."

SonicTheHedgehog,38ixya,AleksPurz,2,Thu Jun 4 15:47:25 2015 UTC,"Take out the bugs and make it slightly easier and more unpredictable and it could have been a better game. I played the whole thing and it was bad with the bugs, but I guess it was OK."
SonicTheHedgehog,38jndb,Levitro,2,Thu Jun 4 17:43:30 2015 UTC,"You mean this?. If we're talking the comics here, the whole genetically modified thing was a bit weird, and the fact that those are actually is knuckles was really dumb in my opinion. If it's the games you're talking about. I think those spikes are part of the gloves, are they not?"
SonicTheHedgehog,38jndb,NewBliss,2,Thu Jun 4 19:20:15 2015 UTC,"they definitely are in Boom, but there's no proof one way or the other in the main games"
SonicTheHedgehog,38jndb,Cadenreigns,1 point,Thu Jun 4 21:56:45 2015 UTC,"I don't see why people would make a deal out of it in the first place. I mean, what do you think is under his gloves? Do people think he's got some sort of flipper thing going on under the mitts?"
SonicTheHedgehog,38jndb,Sea-Salt,1 point,Thu Jun 4 22:44:40 2015 UTC,With a name like Knuckles he should have no fingers...that's a no brainer.
SonicTheHedgehog,38jndb,smith137,1 point,Fri Jun 5 13:45:47 2015 UTC,He's had fingers since 1994. We just haven't seen them until now.

SonicTheHedgehog,38dofg,ZadocPaet,3,Wed Jun 3 15:20:04 2015 UTC,They just featured some information on this in the latest Didyouknowgaming.  When creating environments for Sonic Adventure the Sonic team took Sonic travelling all over the world and took pictures that they based level renders on.
SonicTheHedgehog,38dofg,PKAwesome,6,Fri Jun 5 15:26:02 2015 UTC,"Don't they do this for inspiration revolving around plot/level design?  It's a smart idea. (Though it would be nice if they actually went through with any of their ""good"" ideas.)"
SonicTheHedgehog,38dofg,JoeBob32X,4,Wed Jun 3 19:57:00 2015 UTC,"I think they just do it for fun and ask the people on their twitter account to identify the location. They might give out prizes. I am not sure as I don't speak Japanese and the translation is really iffy.   By the way, I am a really big 32X fan. I love your username! Maybe check out /r/SEGA32X if you haven't already. :)"
SonicTheHedgehog,38dofg,JoeBob32X,3,Wed Jun 3 20:00:17 2015 UTC,"Maybe I will, gotta give the 32X credit for making the Genesis look like a BEAST. (Though, the electric bill ain't too ""beast"".)"
SonicTheHedgehog,38bjyk,Soulcakeeater,18,Wed Jun 3 03:49:40 2015 UTC,"I don't care about how he looks, I care that he's utterly and totally brain-dead now."
SonicTheHedgehog,38bjyk,StandupGaming,5,Wed Jun 3 04:46:04 2015 UTC,"I don't like his looks. But it could be worse.  Design from other perspectives:  Gameplay design - WHERE WAS THE GLIDING  Personality design - ...Ugh... There was one episode where I found him entertaining, but otherwise, yeah... the dumb muscle cliché isn't working for me."

SonicTheHedgehog,38bjyk,Vehk,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:47:40 2015 UTC,MY EYES
SonicTheHedgehog,38bjyk,NoonecanknowMiner,3,Thu Jun 4 02:39:42 2015 UTC,"Honestly from a design standpoint I don't think any of the Sonic Boom redesigns were bad. I even like some of the new character stereotypes (tails more mature, Amy more motherly, Sticks batshit crazy dialogue) but I hate how they made Knuckles an idiot. He was gullible but he was never not intelligent, other wise he wouldn't be tasked with guarding the master emerald. It makes more sense for him to be buffer than the others but he should have his cool, calm mentality back."
SonicTheHedgehog,38bjyk,bman1394,2,Wed Jun 3 10:53:05 2015 UTC,I like all the characters Boom designs more than the main series designs.
SonicTheHedgehog,38bjyk,NoonecanknowMiner,2,Thu Jun 4 02:38:33 2015 UTC,"I don't necessarily hate it, since it doesn't interfere with the main series. But if you have to trade brain for steroids, then I'll hate it for something other than design."
SonicTheHedgehog,38bjyk,The_Sonic_Rings,1 point,Fri Jun 12 01:41:39 2015 UTC,"Okay, yeah, that's understandable."
SonicTheHedgehog,38bjyk,SeniorSophomore,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:56:00 2015 UTC,He needs to not miss leg-day. He's got chicken legs.
SonicTheHedgehog,38bjyk,Sea-Salt,1 point,Wed Jun 3 12:10:09 2015 UTC,"It grew on me, too, as well as his adorkable personality. People cry and cry about ""he's retarded now!!!"", but c'mon, it's a different canon, and just about everybody is exaggerated in some way. Relax; mainline Knuckles isn't going to suddenly start obsessing about the gym or have the intelligence of a kindergartener.  People should have known something was up when Knuckles was actually hanging out with Sonic and the gang instead of being the grumpy loner with a hard-on for a giant gem."
SonicTheHedgehog,38bjyk,StandupGaming,2,Wed Jun 3 12:08:25 2015 UTC,"There are lots of ways they could have made Knuckles exaggerated without making him so damn stupid. Deciding that the best character flaw they could give to muscle guy was stupidity is boring and lazy, not to mention extremely damaging to society's perception of body image vs intelligence."
SonicTheHedgehog,38bjyk,KFCNyanCat,-1,Thu Jun 4 04:34:35 2015 UTC,"I think that while Boom is the only time ""stupid"" Knuckles has actually been entertaining and not ""OMG WHY AREN'T YOU PROTECTING THE MASTER EMERALD STFU AND GO DO THAT"" I still don't like his visuals. Knux was designed to be Sonic's equal, Boom's design takes away from it."
SonicTheHedgehog,388aog,FightGar,2,Tue Jun 2 15:46:40 2015 UTC,So cool.
SonicTheHedgehog,388aog,spindok712,2,Tue Jun 2 22:46:26 2015 UTC,The song is 'Carnival' from Phantasy Star Universe. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwB9xpoGIX4
SonicTheHedgehog,388aog,TheWerewoof,1 point,Wed Jun 3 08:43:11 2015 UTC,"Wow. 8 years. 8 years of this song being stuck in my head and now I finally have the actual audio. Thank you so much! I had always thought the song was from a Sonic game.  Edit: Now I remember, a few years ago I managed to figure out it was named ""Carnival"" but couldn't find the audio anywhere online, glad someone uploaded it. Yesterday's thread on /r/AskReddit about ""What's your internet 'White Whale'?"" inspired me to try and find this again."
