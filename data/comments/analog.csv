You should be able to get it developed almost anywhere and get the same quality (assuming their machines are clean and chemicals are fresh ... and they don't scratch your negatives). Good scans would probably help. In my experience, Superia turns grainy fast when it expires or especially if it cooks in a hot car or something; and it seems fairly intolerant of underexposure. It doesn't turn as blue as Ektar or Portra, but it looks horribly muddy and grey ... no contrast at all. Fresh film should be fine, though."
analog,3e2j4c,schneidan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:33:34 2015 UTC,"I like Superia a lot! I don't have any experience with underexposure, but it handles overexposure fairly well.

I get it developed and scanned at my local 1 hour lab, which is run by a guy who's been doing this for decades, so it's above average, but not quite professional."

You could do something like this but that already is pushing the limits. The sky in that jpeg file just doesn't have the detail I'm assuming you want it to have.  Also worth noting that you have chosen a very difficult scene. I'm assuming the contrast between sky and trees was very high, and there's a limit to the contrast any film can make something out of. This is a similarly difficult scene I came across yesterday. Thanks to having the raw files from the scan I managed to restore some detail from the sky, but as you see, there's not too much there and the rocks in the foreground are almost completely black."

Can you give some details about lenses, apertures, and exposure times used? When will you set up a barndoor tracker?  Funny how we both love to saturate this film with Joshua trees."
analog,3dv37r,velarpinch,6,Sun Jul 19 20:05:50 2015 UTC,"Absolutely! I've been hoarding it in my fridge this whole time. Sorry everybody else!  The super star trail picture with the Joshua Tree in it was an 8 hour exposure at an f/11-16 split, if I'm remembering correctly.  The medium length star trails are sixteen minute exposures at f/4.5 The short ones are f/2.8 at 10 minutes.  On the RZ67 I used the 50mm ULD lens. On the 645J I used a 45mm lens.  It's interesting to see how the color shifted more cyan and sapphire on the 8-hour exposure, but remains more navy and deep blue on the shorter side. Such a beautiful film with outstanding reciprocity.  EDIT: I just recalculated my exposure time. I was remembering wrong, it wasn't an f/11-16 split. It was an f/16-22 split. For the exposure at an f/4.5 it takes 16 minutes. I knew when the sun would go down and start to rise, which gave me roughly 8 hours of darkness. I knew that I wanted to shoot during that entire 8 hour period, so I used Provia 400F's reciprocity table. Starting with f/4.5 at 16 min I then calculated upwards to reach 8 hours. At an f/22 it would take 8 hours and 32 minutes. Since that's a little too long for my time frame, and since f/4.5 is a ⅓ of a stop lower anyways, I opened up to an f/16-22 split (favoring the f/16 side) and cut the exposure at an even 8 hours."

analog,3dv37r,dsgm1984,2,Sun Jul 19 23:30:37 2015 UTC,"I would've grossly overexposed the image. I purposely wanted the longest exposure of the sky possible to get the longest star trails, so that resulted in a smaller aperture to compensate."

analog,3dv37r,TheHiddenHaku,4,Sun Jul 19 22:46:55 2015 UTC,"To be honest, it's just taken a lot of guess work. I shoot test shots on my DSLR until I find a decently exposed image, but it's not a perfect method because digital retains the shadows a LOT better than film. So I usually find a decent setting through digital and then overexpose my film shot by +1⅓. Then I factor in the reciprocity and voila!"

A couple of weeks later, the daughter emailed me asking to see it. She mentioned that her father was actually dying of cancer, and they were visiting the Italian countryside one last time.

I assume that they have worked the kinks out and the paper is only sensitive to very specific bands, and the color film stays off these bands.

The only lens I used for the Canon was a 50mm 1.8, and only the 50mm 1.7, and 28mm 2.8 got used on the Minolta. 35mm film was Ilford HP5+, the rolls in the Minolta were shot at 100 ISO and developed for 5.5 minutes at 24c.

What I can say is that virtually every aspect of the color and exposure of the film is dramatically degraded in the product of a scan compared to what the film actually looks like. On the film-viewer, I can see details across the board from highlights to shadows, colors are saturated and crisp. The range of whites to blacks is especially affected with the image that comes out of the scanner having very poor range in comparison. Color accuracy is also very poor."

The dynamic range is much lower in slide film than any reasonably good scanner, which means you'll have to pull the contrast slider a lot to get the results you're used to from a computer image. You'll also have to do white balance and other form of colour corrections because... that's the way things work.  With that said, I'm assuming you have something like a flatbed scanner, which will not give you a lot of resolution.

Contrast can indeed be a product of it since you need to find the grey point (not covered in that video).  If you look at them side to side, you'll see that your version is incredibly flat. Fixing your RGB levels will fix that. All the detail is still there for you to recover. I think the only part I clipped was the shadow under your shirt on shoulder, but it probably should be based on the exposure anyways.  Color correction is something you'll need to learn to do for every frame unless you buy something to do it for you like ""color perfect"", etc."

Like others have said, find a lab that will 'pull-process' your roll by 1-stop, effectively processing the roll as though you metered it at 200.   You're 100iso shots will be overexposed by a stop (I usually shoot color neg film between 1/2 - 1-stop overexposed by default) and your properly metered 400iso shots will be underexposed by a stop. And all will be within the range/latitude of that film.   If you cannot find a lab to pull-process, just process it as you normally would. The 400iso shots will obviously be fine and the 100iso shots will be overexposed by 2-stop. Depending on what you photographed, they ought to be salvageable."

Overexposed film can be very beautiful, and a lot of photographers - myself included - purposefully rate ISO 400 colour films at 200 or 100 to get saturated pastelly colours.

So if you want to try it for cheap then you can get an eos 850 on keh in ex condition right not for $9 that will be able to use your lenses.

I'm not the biggest fan of the eye control but if you use it properly it's kinda fun. It just feels good in the hands, it's robust and is just a better build quality.   I bought a mamiya rb67 for $165 after shipping. The guy on eBay didn't know how to check it for function so he sold it as is and everyone was scared to make the plunge. I won, it was almost flawless! It has incredibly sharp lenses (shaper than my hasselblad) and just feels like an anchor. So I wouldn't recommend much field use as it is a big heavy camera. It's also a perfect studio camera. It has a leaf shutter so you can sync at all shutter speeds, no batteries so it will always work and the glass is cheap. I bought a flawless 180mm f4.5 from adorama for $100 and is a fantastic portrait lens. If I was in a different position if sell my hasselblad and keep my mamiya's.   I personally have a 500cm, Rb67, 645pro, and a yashica tlr that I over payed for many years ago for $80 and I have taken stunning photos with all of them. It's just the look of MF! Basically what I'm trying to say is that good deals are out there and you can save a few bucks. I've spent from $80-1000 on each camera kit and I enjoy all of them.    The lenses are going to be slower than 35mm but the DOF or OOF area has a different look(better in my opinion) than small format - wait till you try LF haha.   One thing to keep in mind is that a lot of medium format cameras where built for professional use. Pro's likes the speed and convenience of 135 but the image quality of large format so the MF was the best compromise of the two and that's one of the reason they are more expensive. Built for pro use where as a lot of 135 cameras where consumer grade."
analog,3dopxj,rhyno0688,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:58:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks for sharing your experience. I love it.   If I'm using this just for a hobby, and don't really mind the lack of speed, weight, or inconvenience, do you think I might prefer LF? Is that generally less or more expensive than MF (initially)? I've been developing my BW 35mm film with a tank and a film changing dark bag. I know the cartridge can fit MF flim as well, which is why I was looking at MF. But is there a convenient way to develop LF without a proper dark room?"
analog,3dopxj,han5henman,2,Sun Jul 19 22:14:27 2015 UTC,"I would stick with medium format, buy a decent and cheaper camera to play with. Then if you decide you still want to go to a bigger negative then make the jump. 135 and 120/220 are similar just one is bigger negative. Large format on the other hand is a whole new ball game, you have movements on almost all of them though some like my Graflex are very limited. Others like my Calumet 45n have more movements then I'll probably ever need.   When getting into large format it's a different mindset, I can grab a smaller camera like my mamiya 645 pro and a roll of film and go shoot or if a bring my 500cm I'll grab my light meter but that's it in many cases. LF you need the tripod, loupe, film holders (preferably loaded haha) dark cloth and light meter (spot meter preferred) and find your subject matter if you hadn't already figured that out. I will usually only take one, maybe two, shots per scene and each scene can take up to 10-15 minutes to set up though some are much quicker but we're still talking a few minutes.   Recently I've been having so much fun with my Graflex and a polaroid back! The peel apart Fuji fp-100c gives you a instant positive and the part most people throw away can be made into a scanable negative with a little bleach! But that's a different conversation.   Are you going to be developing the film yourself? Do you have a local lab that will process sheet film? Do you prefer B&W or color?  Here is the reasoning behind these questions, you will have to get all of the film holders and tanks it if you want to spend the money on daylight tanks you end up spend way more money than roll film tanks. If you don't have a local lab that will process them, you'll have to ship the film off. Black and white doesn't have to be expensive, I have shot and developed the Arista EDU 100 for aprox. $.70-.80 a sheet with decent results though I think the film went up a dollar or two since then.  Color is outrageously expensive -$3-5 a sheet plus $3.5-5 to develop at a lab. That makes $6.5-10 per shot!!! I hope your making good money for that expense (I know it is a hobby for you)  I live large format and am in the process of teaching my dad a bit so he can use his tachihara but it is definitely a commitment. I can't decide for you but either way you go, large format or a decent MF camera, you'll get much better quality over 135. My Calumet with Nikkor 135 f/5.6 with 18 film holders and an almost full box of cheaper film cost $200, so it doesn't have to be expensive. But better grades of film will drastically change that. I have a higher ""keeper"" rate with LF over MF and higher rate with MF over 135. Mostly because if I set up the shot and don't like it as much as I thought I'll walkaway.   Sorry my answers are so long but I try to educate people as much as I can so they will make the best decision."
analog,3dopxj,han5henman,2,Sun Jul 19 22:48:38 2015 UTC,"you can get MF cameras for around $200 easily. Some great choices are a Yashica 124 (twin lens reflex), a Kiev 60 or Kiev 88 (a hasselblad knockoff) or a Zeiss Ikon Ikonta.   I own a Yashica 124 and a Zeiss Ikon. Personally I prefer the Yashica, though it isn't my go to camera (that's a Mamiya 645) but it's still great bang for you buck, plus it looks cool!"
analog,3dopxj,EdwardMowinckel,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:33:28 2015 UTC,Thank you! Those are some great options. Why do you prefer the Yashica more than your go-to camera?
analog,3dopxj,lennox_mcdough,2,Sun Jul 19 22:11:33 2015 UTC,"oh i'm sorry, i think i didn't phrase it well. Between the Yashica and the Zeiss, i prefer the yashica. but it is not my go to camera, the mamiya 645 is.   why i prefer the yashica over the zeiss though? it's easier to use, the framing is not as vague as the zeiss(which is a rangefinder) you get more shots (10 vs 8) and the lens is sharper."
analog,3dopxj,lennox_mcdough,4,Mon Jul 20 01:11:06 2015 UTC,"For Canon's, the EOS 1V is their last flagship 35mm camera, goes for about $400 used. The EOS 3 is a step below that and goes for about $200 used, a step below that is the EOS Elan 7e, which goes for less than $100. The EOS 1V can do 10 FPS, and has the best autofocus system of Canon camera bodies.   The Elan 7e would be a good bet for a budget AF 35mm Canon, but if you have the cash, you wouldn't regret getting an EOS 1V."

Do you like the spontaneity of a rangefinder or the control of an SLR?   Once you've decided with that, then you choose the size. 645 (15 shots, lower resolution), 6x6, 6x7, even 6x9 (8 shots greater resolution)? Each one has their own pros and cons.   Lastly once you've made those decisions, it's time to start looking for something that fits your budget!

It can work in the studio or in the field, it's lighter and more portable than the Mamiya RZ/RB's, and the square frame makes you think harder.  Plus, Zeiss lenses are works of art.  I suspect that with some TLC it will hold its value."

I like it because it's a system camera, kind of like a big SLR, and it's smaller than the 6x7 cameras.  Other options I haven't seen listed yet could be a rangefinder like a Fuji GW690, or a TLR like a Yashica 124G or Rolleiflex."
analog,3djn3p,lennox_mcdough,2,Fri Jul 17 03:22:32 2015 UTC,"Hey man,  I have a 500CM, two A12 backs, started with an 80mm lens (just sold it as I found a good 50mm for not much money and prefer the wider angle).  I actually love the blad, which is funny, because at the time I almost went for a pano camera - like an Xpan or 6x17. And ended up going in the opposite direction with a square format.  The square format takes a while to get used to but you can do some great stuff with it. It's quite a tight and intimate form of shooting. You can do some interesting stuff. I think it makes you think more about angles etc as well.  I think it's worth the money if you can spare it. Blads are fairly cheap now (You could probably get the kit I originally got for 1200 for around 900 now), that said they hold their price well and it fluctuates fairly slowly.  I love the mechanical aspect of it. Never worry about batteries. The design is very clever with EV values on the lens etc. There are a few fiddly things but do some reading and you'll never have an issue. If you have a smartphone you can use that as a very capable light meter in fact. It's a compact camera, I've travelled with it all over the world and never had a problem. If you buy from somewhere like KEH or a good ebayer you shouldn't need to worry about a CLA or anything.  That said, the Bronica is supposed to be great. I have a friend recently got an ETRS kit and he loves it. Quick operation, easy work, inbuilt meter and all of that. Also cheap as balls for what it is. Less attractive but good. The value fluctuates more but it's significantly less to start with.  I would look at the gear and see what your kit is gonna be.  For me, I was only going for one lens with my body and gear, and in truth the 'blad didn't cost much more that way. With multiple lenses the Bronny is a much cheaper option and by all accounts they are great lenses.  You'll be happy with either."
analog,3djn3p,lennox_mcdough,2,Fri Jul 17 06:52:39 2015 UTC,"I haven't owned a Hasselblad, only a Mamiya RB67, Rolleiflex and a Bronica SQ-Ai. Here are my thoughts:   Mamiya RB67 is a large, bulky camera with a rotating back. Lenses are controlled by a mechanical timer, thus suffering from mechanical errors and are prone to having inaccurate times, varying even more in hot/cold weather etc. The perk is that they are easier to fix, or that's at least the rumor I've heard. Rolleiflex is small, light and a lot of bang/buck, but inaccurate composition compared to a SLR (as the Mamiya or the Bronica). Suffers from the same perks/cons as the Mamiya RB67. The Bronica SQ-A(i) is an electronically controlled camera, thus requires batteries. The rumor states that if it brakes down, it's hard to impossible to fix, but the major perk is that the times are much more exact than the mechanical ones, won't vary (as much) depending on weather etc. The system is cheaper than Hasselblad as everyone is wondering if it's worth anything compared to a Hasselblad, decides to go for the Hasselblad any way and pushes the Bronica prices down.   I've used my Bronica SQ-Ai for a few years (2-3 years?) and I've put at least a hundred rolls through mine. My entire system (50 mm, 80 mm, 110 mm, 150 mm, WLF, metering prism, two backs) costs roughly $1000, which is the average price for a Hasselblad with WLF, one back and the 80 mm lens here in Sweden.   I might go for a Hasselblad one day (I'll call him Hasse, the Bronica lacks an equally good nickname in swedish) but that would be after running my current system into the ground, replacing the needed parts once or twice and then putting it on a shelf to remember it's valiant service."

analog,3djn3p,1FatTony,2,Fri Jul 17 00:59:26 2015 UTC,"Depends. You can work a lot quicker with something like the mamiya 645. With a waistlevel camera like the 500C/M you're really forced to frame and compose and adjust perspective. Different types of work will be easier with each kind of camera.   Re perspective on waist level finders, it's not as obvious as with a view camera, but much more obvious than with cameras that you hold to your face.   6x6 is a little easier to print than 645. The film stays flatter on the holder.   RB67 and RZ67 are similar to 500C/M in terms of how you work."

I'll try to answer your questions but forgive me if I'm off the mark a bit.   1) Yes  2) the ae-1 is actually a shutter priority slr, meaning you set the aperture you want and change the shutter speed to match the red number in the viewfinder to the aperture you selected. Personally, I hold the silver button on the side of the lens mount down with my left hand and maneuver the shutter speed dial with my right until I get it matched to expose correctly.   3) the ae-1 has a dof preview lever on the left side of the camera. It's a black notch that you flip up and push in. From there you can see the depth of field it. You won't be able to see the iris itself change without the dof preview lever on.   I think I covered everything but there's also a manual you can google online that might answer any other questions you have"
analog,3dk9fb,joeyjaboba,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:48:02 2015 UTC,"The easier way to meter with the AE1-P is to set an appropriate shutter speed that you like, and stick with it. Then the numbers in the viewfinder tell you what to set your aperture to for that shot. This is how shutter-priority works... then you have the ability to just put the aperture ring on ""A"" and let the camera make that decisions (which is fine if you were just going to do what it told you to anyway). This is how shutter-priority works... your priority is to have a particular shutter speed and the camera (or you) will adjust aperture to get the correct exposure.  Match needle meters make a lot more sense because you can more easily see and understand the results of adjusting aperture or shutter speed."
analog,3dk9fb,themicahmachine,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:08:58 2015 UTC,That's actually the way I was doing it before but it got annoying having to take my eye off the viewfinder and look at the number on the dial.

If you put the lens to ""A"" it will automatically use whichever aperture it displayed. Otherwise, that aperture is just a suggestion and doesn't change the exposure at all... just tells you what it thinks you should use.  If the required aperture is smaller than the lens is capable, it will blink 22 or 32. If it needs an aperture larger than the lens is capable of, it will blink 1.0 or 1.4. You can get it back into a usable range by adjusting the shutter speed."

analog,3dgjnz,jeffk42,3,Thu Jul 16 02:30:08 2015 UTC,"very first thing, nice shots!  second thing - using 23 years expired film to trouble shoot processing is a little sporty in my book. if something goes wrong, there are a gazillion factors you don't have control over that will have an effect on your photos.  with that in mind:  the streaking likely comes from uneven drying after development. if you use flow, try use less - you need about a single drop per liter of water bath. the spots look like air bubbles on the film - did you tap the tank properly every time after you inverted?  regarding the sharpness: did you shoot all the 50mm ones at 1.4? if yes then you have not much wiggle room to play with. i don't think it's down to the lens but either your camera's mirror or focusing screen is out of place a little."
analog,3dgjnz,provia,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:23:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah the 50mm was at 1.4 or 2.0 for most of the shots I took with it... I've got a couple of other cameras that are also due for a CLA, so maybe I'll bring that one in too. I have another OM-4T body so I'll switch to that one for the next roll and see.  I did tap the tank a couple of times after each agitation (I used the included agitator paddle to spin it back and forth rather than inverting). Maybe not enough force to dislodge those bubbles or something. And I did use flow, but it was more like ~2 mL for the 300mL that was in the tank.  Sounds like I overdid it. :)  Thanks for the tips!  I think I'll put this expired film back in the canister for now and load up a bulk roll of HP5+. I sort of just wanted to shoot through it with pointless photos while I practice developing because it didn't cost me anything, but you're right, I should probably start with a reduced set of variables. :-)  Edit:  I just brought out both of my OM-4T bodies and compared them... eyeballing it, the focus screens and mirrors are positioned identically.  The mirror has a mark at resting position, and both are right up against it. I dunno.  I was shooting wide open or close to it, but it can't be overstated how careful I am to achieve perfect focus, lining up verticals perfectly in the split prism, before tripping the shutter.  There's an almost zero percent chance that, in bright daylight, my focus would be THAT far off almost every single time. So I'm leaning toward a hardware failure somewhere... bleh  Edit 2: Just pulled out the 5D Mk3 and put the Zuiko 50/1.4 on there to test it, vindicating both the lens and my aging eyes, as I was able to focus perfectly several times with a viewfinder that has no manual focus aids. :)"

Taking a few differently framed shots of subjects with hard lines is something I do now for redundancy and as making one line straight in post will make another wonky if the shots not centered."

It's currently set to 10 (feet? meters?) Behind that, the red numbers are focus zone markers The ring of numbers behind that is your shutter speed. Looks like that's set with the toothy ring behind the numbers. Is that what's attached to the tab below the lens? Then finally, the aperture markings.  It looks like the aperture is selected by moving that metal arrow.   Edit:  I did some digging and found your exact model (Type 022) manufactured from 1954 to 1958. Here is a page with some info but it's in French.  The translation is... questionable, but I think they're talking about that lever below the lens here (or may be some other lever):  ""For adjusting the exposure, there is a speed / aperture coupling system that (once the good graduation is selected through a hand cell) to change speed or aperture as needed while keeping the good couple.""  So it sounds like there's a way to change the shutter speed and aperture independently, and then once you do, there's a way to shift that exposure one way or the other while keeping the values locked relative to each other. So, for example, if you have the exposure set to 1/60 at f/8, you could move a lever that would move both so that you're shooting at 1/30 at f/11, or 1/125 at f/5.6, keeping the exposure constant but allowing you to prioritize your shutter speed or aperture."
analog,3d8q0x,jeffk42,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:22:04 2015 UTC,"I'm betting you're spot on there. I have a Kodak Signet 50 about the same vintage, and the aperture and shutter speed rings lock together. You ""lift"" the shutter ring (pull toward front of lens) to turn it independently and get the right shutter/aperture combination for the exposure value shown on the meter. Once the exposure is set, you can then adjust both settings in tandem to maintain exposure while adjusting depth of field or shutter speed, say, to stop action. It was tough to get used to, but really quite handy for street-type work."

Then you see news like this.  More film being discontinued, and prices going up for the rest of the line (which might signify the beginning of the end for those as well).

analog,3d7m8m,MagnetoFlow,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:37:30 2015 UTC,the indoor shots are a couple of stops underexposed. the mushy look is what you get when the scanner is trying to compensate the lack of signal.  check the film strip too - the mushy looking shots will be very very thin on the film.
analog,3d7m8m,provia,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:23:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it definitely looks like it's just a matter of underexposure for the indoor shots. Open up a couple of stops and you'll get much better results.  How are you metering the scene? Maybe an adjustment to your process will help out?  Some of your outdoor photos might be overexposed too, causing the color shift (most noticeable on the pic of the girl with the flag)."
analog,3d7m8m,jeffk42,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:51:07 2015 UTC,I've been sort of going by the sunny 16 method but these are only my second and third rolls shot since a photo class I took years ago in high school. There is a light meter built into the camera (Olympus OM-1 MD) but I think it needs to be calibrated because the meter stays very low and does not reach desired position until I get to much slower shutter speeds. Adjusting the f stop barely makes it budge and I've read that going slower than 30 shutter speed causes a lot of blur unless on a tripod. Also that is with a new battery.
analog,3d7m8m,jeffk42,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:26:39 2015 UTC,"Well, here are a couple of things to consider:   For the meter, it's possible that it's not moving much because you're just still not in the range you need to be in.  For example, I just went into a bedroom that was lit by a large window in bright daylight and I took a reading with my handheld meter.  At ISO 400, it read 1/20 at f/1.8. To my eyes, it was a pretty well-lit room. The photos in your ""Duds"" list look, to my eye, to be in a darker area than where I was sitting.   I'm not sure what phone you have, but I'm sure every major phone operating system has a free light meter app.  It's not the most accurate thing in the world, but under ""usual"" circumstances, it'll be within a half stop or so. Compare your camera's meter to the phone meter and see what you come up with.If the meter doesn't move when you're inside but it moves when you're outside, then it's probably just too dark in your house. :-) 1/30 for a 50mm lens is the rule of thumb for handheld shots, but it's not a rule.  If you brace carefully and hold your breath, you can get sharp images at lower speeds. Sometimes it just takes a little practice. If you want to be able to take photos in that indoor environment without a flash or better lighting, you'll need to switch film to give you some extra speed, or push the 400 to something faster. I have no personal knowledge regarding how well Superia responds to push processing, but there are always other films that do well."
analog,3d7m8m,rhyno0688,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:19:16 2015 UTC,"That film doesn't do to bad when you push it a couple of stops. You get the expected grain and saturation, wouldn't be good for enlargements but definer usable images."
analog,3d7m8m,rhyno0688,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:25:27 2015 UTC,"Just out of curiosity, have you changed the camera's ISO to 400? If it is not set properly it would explain why your meter isn't really working. Are you changing the aperture and shutter speed at all? Or are you changing it a stop or two?   Those inside images are what you would expect when you underexposed and don't condensate in developing (pushing) but that is a conversation for when you get better at working the camera and more basic exposure knowledge/knowhow under your belt."

analog,3d5vr5,TheOneOutlander,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:40:38 2015 UTC,"I have limited experience, but you might look at the Ilford Delta line or the Kodak TMAX or TRI-X lines. All are tabular fine grain films (correction: 400TX is cubic). Tri-X (400TX) is specifically designed for pushing according to the Kodak literature. It would likely be a good for those low light indoor or evening shots.   I think the Kodak films have a reputation for being a little ""punchier"" (higher contrast) than the Ilford, and the couple rolls of Kodak I shot seem to show that FWIW. But the developer chemistry also matters.   Edit - TLDR: If it was my wedding day I'd go with Tri-X 400 all day. Congrats OP!"
analog,3d5vr5,Dudewheresmybeard,2,Mon Jul 13 20:03:08 2015 UTC,"If it were me I'd load 400TX (Tri-X) in a heartbeat. But that's because I've shot a developed hundreds of rolls of the stuff.  For your case, without prior experience in B/W, I will still recommend it for two main reasons.  First, you can shoot 400TX at ISO 400 or ISO 800 with no change in development time. So you can under expose by one stop when you need that extra speed mixed with ISO 400 exposures on the same roll and process it all together. This is due to the massive exposure latitude of this film.  Second, because 400TX is very common most places that do any amount of B/W processing will not screw up your film. Also most common developers out there will produce nice results with 400TX. So it is your safest bet for developer compatibility.  You can also grab a few rolls and as it gets dark wind out your ISO 400/800 roll and reload for fun party shots at ISO 1600, 400TX also pushes incredibly well to ISO 1600.  Congrats on your upcoming wedding!  BTW: I love my FM2s I have one silver and one black and 2 motor drives. They just keep rocking."

analog,3d5vr5,slyr114,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:21:43 2015 UTC,The manual for your developer should list times for different iso speeds for a variety of films. TMAX development times will most likely be specified for any developer.

But even then, getting consistent results will require time and patience, with lots of trial and error."

analog,3d4kug,IsaacJDean,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:01:58 2015 UTC,Thanks for taking the time to edit this! Did the negative seem properly developed and scanned? Some tutorials i looked at told me to scan the image as bright as possible without clipping highlights and put white balance at 2500k.
analog,3d4kug,swidge,2,Mon Jul 13 16:06:55 2015 UTC,"It looks to be developed fine to me but I'm more of a black & white shooter (so far). The photo does seem soft, not sure if that is because of the scan, the actual photo or even a soft lens.  Absolutely scan as bright as you can but keep the ISO at the lowest, have your lens at least at F/8 and your shutter speed should be quick enough that little shakes and wobbles from the camera won't effect sharpness, or have a rig that's super stable.  I recently did a few rolls of colour film myself and I white balanced in lightroom from the outer black edge and tweaked it a tad for each image. Also desaturated the yellow channel a tad but that was a characteristic of the film I think (it made underexposed faces look ill)."

I'd still have to take my 50mm for low-light situations, so then the only thing I'd gain with the zoom (over the 28+50 combo) would be a little bit of reach, which would be nice for portraits but then again, these are not my priority and can be done with the 50mm. I think I'll pass.   I'm still searching for a Canon G10/G11 for scanning my negatives.

analog,3d17ly,Mathieuser,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:56:48 2015 UTC,"Colour is about film used, time of day, weather conditions, time of year, scanning, post processing etc. I remember a thread on flickr where a guy posted five images taken on film and asked us to guess which film each image was taken on. I put in my five guesses and after several dozen other replies he told us all they were all shot on Ektar and edited to look like other films, completely fooled everyone.  Your photo looks decently exposed but it also looks completely unprocessed, what do you do with your images after you scan them? You should be scanning them with the method described here to get the most from them, then editing them in something like Lightroom.  What film do you use? What was the film, camera and post processing on the image you want your images to look like?  I've scanned all my images with the Epson V500, is there any here that look like you want yours to look?"
analog,3d17ly,Morinaka,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:28:52 2015 UTC,"Never stand near train tracks, not even for one photo. (I know that's not you, but just so you don't get the same retarded idea.) Your scanner will not perform perfectly. Given that it is a flatbed scanner, you are limited to low resolution scans; that's just the nature of it. That is part of the problem you see with your image. Your photo is a bit flat – it lacks in contrast. This can be fixed a bit with a simple curves adjustment., though exactly what level of contrast you want is a personal taste thing. Vignetting can be used to great effect, but in this case it's a bit extreme in my opinion. An image without noticeable vignetting can also sometimes look sharper because it has its natural contrast right out to the edges. I've done a rubbish job of removing it, but this might give you the right idea. If I was there at the scene, I would move the subject a little and then crop more aggressively. How aggressively you crop depends on whether you want to make a landscape shot with a person in it or more of an environmental portrait almost. I moved the subject because they were standing right in front of a cliff face with lots of detail in it, and I felt like that distracted a bit from the subject. Putting the subject in front of sky almost always works. The highlights have a slightly red tinge to them, so I might try to get rid of that.   I'm not sure where to go after that. Snow is actually notoriously difficult to get right, because it's so reflective. It easily gets too bright in the sun and blue in the shadows (because it's reflecting the blue sky above.) I made a before-and-after gif of what I did until point 6. Keep in mind I threw this together pretty quickly. If you're looking to make a print you should probably be more careful with your pencils and such.  The particular example you provided is in other words a fairly difficult image to get right, because there are lots of little adjustments that conflict with that scene. But in general, what you lack is probably post work. Your scan is probably about as good as it gets with your scanner."

I know labs drumscan negatives to a desired size, but i never did it, and its rather expensive.

What would be a great neg scanner for decent print sizes and good sharpness under 400€/$?   3, 4, 5, 6: thanks for this advice. I always have the feeling that my basic post-production free image already lacks of quality. When i scan my images with vuescan, they are always very dark and blue-ish (no auto curves, just a lossless image), and i find it so hard to get the true colors.. Sometimes it turns out good, then i do a few more images, but then i discover all three image's tints in white are slightly different, and then i dont feel any connection between the pictures.. Another thing i've experienced is sharpness vs grain: the granier the images, the less sharpening actually makes the image better.. Would this be a scanner thing? I'm trying iso 100 rolls this trip, see if that gets rid of the grain..  thanks!"

But they are kinda expensive, and I haven't gotten around to buying one myself yet for that reason.  Sharpening will always also sharpen the grain, yes.

There are two reasons this would be very dangerous to do behind a car:   It can stop and accelerate very suddenly, which would jerk you off the platform unless you're really holding on to it, and When turning or otherwise by accident the platform can slide out of control in all kinds of directions.   None of these are applicable to a train, which will start and stop slowly, and you can't really go anywhere except... on the rails.  I mean, I'd still prefer to go inside the train where I'm safely contained by the walls of the train, but the walls of the train are basically the only extra safety you get inside the train that I can think of.

A lot of excellent advice has been given regarding IR film in general and black and white IR specifically. Color IR however is a little different than black and white in my experience.  In theory, color IR is actually easier to work with than black and white, as you can use standard color filters (either a Yellow 12 or Orange 21 are recommended) and it can be shot handheld (nominal ISO for color IR is 400, so you don't need a tripod). Personally  I find the Yellow 12 filter leaves my photos with too much of a cyan cast for my taste, so I use the Orange 21 to balance the colors a bit more. I just set my camera to 400 ISO and meter through the filter and have had excellent results. Both of these shots were metered through an Orange 21:  https://www.flickr.com/photos/31008270@N02/19305253966/in/dateposted-public/  https://www.flickr.com/photos/31008270@N02/14660785285/in/dateposted-public/  Some people like to use a red filter but I haven't tried that personally - again, it's largely a matter of what looks best to you. I've never heard of anyone using the Hoya R72 with color IR. Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm not sure you would even get photos with the R72 - it is designed for black and white IR and has a rather high cutoff (720nm) that may or may not be within the spectrum of color IR film.  In response to your other questions, I wouldn't waste such an expensive and rare film trying to shoot urban or night scenes, but that's just my two cents. Where IR film in general really shines is in sunlit nature scenes, as trees and other plant life reflect the most infrared light. /u/ndunning pretty much sums this up in his post.  Have fun with it and be sure to post up your results!"

Luckily there's lots of nature in and around the city I will be shooting so I will keep that in mind when composing my shots.  Will do! Thanks again man."
analog,3d06p9,Whitey_Fisk_161,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:40:38 2015 UTC,"Yep, the film you posted from the FPP is exactly what I'm shooting with. Of course, I do always bracket -/+1 stop with slide film, but 400 ISO through the filter seems to give me the best results."
analog,3d06p9,rainy1_0,2,Tue Jul 14 12:37:56 2015 UTC,"I can't comment on the color aspect, as I've only shot black and white Agfa infrared film, but I can give you some idea of my experience with my two rolls.  I would recommend taking your photographs in daylight, as the film is sensitive to light in the near infrared spectrum. Obviously some types of artificial lights (like incandescent) will emit that wavelength too, but in my experience there isn't enough to take a photo in any reasonable time. Keep in mind I used a Hoya R72 filter, that blocked out almost all visible light, because the infrared film is still somewhat sensitive to  visible light, and without using it I got the equivalent of a normal black and white film. Also, even in daylight, to get sharp shots I focused with the filter off and moved the focus to the infrared mark on my lens while on a tripod, because I still had to use exposure times that were longer than I expected.  I'm by no means an expert, but I just hope that, since there aren't many people who would be able to answer I presume, you could benefit from what I've learned."

analog,3d06p9,TheCrimsonSheep,2,Sun Jul 12 13:19:39 2015 UTC,"No problem! Surprisingly I didn't develop them myself since I don't have the chemicals for them, but the local lab was able to do it for me in two weeks so not too bad.  I think the longest exposure time I got to was one second, although for the first roll I did about four shots of each, bracketing, from about 1/15, 1/10 each.  If you don't mind waiting a bit, I could scan in some photos when I can get them tomorrow and edit the link in."

Portra 160 produces almost grainless negatives with wonderful colors. Acros 100 IS grainless as near as I can tell. The ""film"" look of washed out colors and overexposure has been born from the lomo movement. Old prints from the 60s and 70s can look like that, mostly because most cameras that everyday people used back then didn't have meters (overexposure), and the prints have faded over time due to improper processing by the then-new 1-hour lab.  Shoot Kodak Gold 400, Fuji Superia 400, or other cheap films if you want the ""film"" look, but you'll mostly be disappointed. I've never seen a film that looks like an Instagram filter."

analog,3cxus0,kqr,2,Sun Jul 12 16:56:04 2015 UTC,"I have tried two things:   A sheet of thick but clear plastic between negatives and screen. This works well enough to diffuse the pixels, but it's yet another thing to clean before you scan or you'll get a bunch of dust and stuff from it visible in your images. Raise the negatives up an inch or so from the screen. This way, the pixels will (probably) be out of focus enough that they're diffused that way.  I have two cardboard sheets where I have cut out a rectangle roughly the size of the negative. I hamburger the negative between these when shooting. The lower cardboard sheet has like a stack of similar sheets taped to it, all with their holes slightly larger and aligned under the negative hole. The mass of these extra sheets stacked on is enough to raise the negative a bit.   I currently like the second solution the best, because it was really hard for me to clean the plastic sheet I used to have between the screen and the negatives. The second solution also has a bonus to it: you don't even have to clean the screen! You only have to clean the negatives. It has made things a lot easier for me, and eventually I guess I'll have to construct something out of a material that's not... cardboard and gaffer tape.  Edit: Pictures, because something about a thousand words:   The lower sheets of cardboard, with a roughly 135 negative sized rectangle cut all the way through, viewed from the top The same unit, viewed from the bottom, so you can see how the bottom sheets have a really big hole because they're not as important – all they do is let light through and raise the whole assembly up Trash strip of 135 film on the hole you saw in the first picture (The crescent you're seeing is not an eyelash. I accidentally creased the film before development and apparently that exposes the film somehow. Lucky it was on an otherwise unexposed part of the roll!) Trash strip of 135 film being held in place by the upper sheet of cardboard, which also has an appropriately sized hole cut out of it   The reason the size of the holes closest to the negative is crucial is because I want to trap all four sides of the negative between cardboard such that the negative is held flat. I've previously have problems where it has bulged up on one side because that's what Tri-X does apparently."

analog,3cwmfx,djlemma,3,Sat Jul 11 16:33:33 2015 UTC,"Long time Hassy shooter here.  A couple of ProTips:  1) Hassy never made a bad lens for their cameras.  You shouldn't hesitate to buy an older T* or even chrome C lens.  Yes, they may need a CLA, but - unless there are optical defects like separation or mould, - anything they've ever made will serve you well.  1A) The one exception to 1) is the 250mm Sonnar which has always been soft to my eye, at least in it's old C Chrome incarnation.  This turns out to be a good thing because that makes it a nice portrait lens (equivalent to about a 155mm on a 35mm camera).  The problem with the 120mm and 150mm - both exquisite lenses - is that are SO sharp, they show every imperfection in a person's face and skin this requiring some kind of diffusion in the darkroom and/or in the post capture digital workflow.  2) Always ensure that both the lens and camera are cocked when mounting or unmounting lenses.  If you don't, you will jack up the camera badly.  3) Make a point of firing the body, every lens at every speed, and cranking through the backs at least once every month or 6 weeks.  This will keep the lubricants from packing up.  These things were made to be USED.  Have a blast, they are phenomenal cameras."

analog,3cwwnh,KoolKiller,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:26:06 2015 UTC,"Haven't really tried pushing too much, except unintentionally (accidentally shooting 100 film at EI 400). As for the Ilford 3200, I like its grain on 35mm and I'm somewhat conflicted about it on medium format. It's coarse enough to be annoying, but not enough to be an artistic choice (if you get my meaning). This particular photo is cropped, so it's similar to what it would look like on 35mm. I suppose it also depends on the developer used (this is Rodinal 1+25)."

You can't go wrong, you can only choose one that fits your preferences more or less, and you'll naturally adapt to either. (But I love my Mamiya and it's lenses, got to try out all of the 43, 50, and 60 this weekend; I'm pretty sold on this kit, haha.)"
analog,3cwt94,metajames,2,Sun Jul 12 03:50:05 2015 UTC,"Mine's a champ (7II), I have no beef with build quality and it goes lots of places with me, hikes, beach, street etc. I'm also generally pretty careful with my gear. I love rangefinders so the Mamiya is perfect for me, I feel that it is more compact than the Pentax. I also considered the fuji but lack of meter and fixed lens (although excellent) kept me away.  Keep in mind that the Mamiya lenses have a close focus distance of about 1m+ and max apertures of f/4. However, I have the 80mm and the 150mm and find them both to be superb.  Most of the ""normal"" range Pentax lenses are 0.7m closest focus and some are .5m like the 75mm f/2.8 AL & Macro 100mm f/4. The Pentax lenses also more options that have faster apertures. So if you like shooting wide portraits the Pentax may be the way to go.  Also note that the Pentax has a max shutter of 1/1000 vs 1/500 for the Mamiya.  I went with the Mamiya because I wanted a medium format with great image quality that I could shoot discretely and wasn't a pain to carry when out and about with the family. I often throw it over my shoulder, stick a few rolls of 120 in my pocket and go. Also the whisper quiet leaf shutter and ultra light release lets me handhold down to about 1/15 if I'm careful and 1/30 regularly.  IMHO, the Pentax looks better on paper but the Mamiya shoots better for my use case. I also shoot a bunch of other rangefinders so I work quickly and naturally with it. For work where I need closer focus or where there is more of a ""setup"" I bust out the Hassy. Your needs may be different from mine but this has been my experience."

Since the lens has the shorter FFD, that means that infinity focus would be impossible without adding additional optics to counteract the problem.  That would affect image quality, so most people don't care to do it.  I posted something about it not long ago, if you're interested in a little more detail.  If you still want to do it, the adapter is here.  It's more expensive than a normal adapter because of the optics, and the performance isn't as good (again, because of the optics) compared to a standard adapter, but there it is. :-)  Hope that helps!"

analog,3cos0p,kqr,2,Thu Jul 9 17:55:13 2015 UTC,"Yes. Generally speaking, the higher the ISO, the more development time you need. Pushed film needs more time than a box speed at the same ISO. So 400 ISO shot at 1600 needs more development than 1600 ISO film shot at 1600 ISO. Some developers are better for push processing or fast films, the same way some films are better for long exposures or push processing.   If the film is shot at a standard ISO, the company SHOULD develop it at the recommend ISO of that particular film."

analog,3cmmkc,Camera_Lucida,2,Thu Jul 9 02:22:28 2015 UTC,"It would depend off your orientation to the polarized light source ( in that case I'm guessing the sun).

analog,3cklv6,ablitsm,2,Thu Jul 9 04:20:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I'll admit I'm not sure about the crop, but it's actually there out of necessity: the original frame extends to the left which wasn't as appealing. Lesson definitely learnt! How would you have liked it framed?"
analog,3cklv6,ablitsm,2,Thu Jul 9 04:35:36 2015 UTC,"I think it looks great in a square crop. I'm very partial to this ratio and I use it all the time for every kind of subject.  I agree that your composition is under some sort of tension, perhaps stepping to the left and having more space between the bird and the first lamppost would have helped.   More negative space would allow the rule of thirds to be applied and keeping it square. This would include more of the surroundings to the right and you would have needed to step back.   Personally I would crop down even more, keep the square format. Noise becomes very notable now. We can put the magpie on a rule of thirds node and use the second lamppost as counterweight. Now the first lamppost becomes intrusive, it would be a shame if something were to happen to it... And while we are digitally painting the scene anyway, I feel the foreground could use more contrast in my opinion.  Because you have such a strong leading line to the upper right a portrait crop in a ratio like 5:7 could work as well (lines). Again, the lamppost would look better if a bit to the right, or even when it wasn't there all.   Using something just off square like a 5:4 horizontal would only need slightly more horizontal and look good (lines). (we could definitely fill this in with photoshop). I'm not a fan of a 3:2 ratio or wider for this image, your vertical component is to strong.   Again, I like your current composition. If I were your editor, I would go for the 5:4 and fill in, or the 1:1 cropped and live with the noise. The 5:4 is more mysterious, and the 1:1 captures more of the curious action of the magpie. I would probably try to pull more detail out of the magpie as well if I was going more for this portrait feel.   Oh well, let me know if you need these taken down. I hope you don't mind my experimenting."

analog,3cnzkm,shoshiyoshi,7,Thu Jul 9 11:38:26 2015 UTC,"When I'm being totally honest I'd say don't waste your money on such an overpriced crap plastic camera.   Go on ebay and buy an old rangefinder for a buck that is a) better build quality b) tiny fraction of the price c) you can take ""proper"" photos with it once you get sick of what lomography cameras produces.  I love rangefinders and bought a ton of amazing cameras for 1€ or 5€ in amazing functioning condition. You can just buy a couple of those and see which one you like. For example my fav 1€ buy was a Minolta Hi Matic which is a tiny but amazing camera.  Once you got yourself a cheap small rangefinder on ebay you can buy expired film for the ""lomo-effect"" you are looking for (lack of sharpness / random colors etc)."
analog,3cnzkm,McGirton,3,Thu Jul 9 13:23:32 2015 UTC,"That's some really great advice.  The general consensus in this thread seems to be that I should just get an old point and shoot and use expired film, so I think I'll look into that. I'm also thinking I can just go ahead and buy more expired film with those effects and use them in the camera I already have.  Thank again!"
analog,3cnzkm,probably_normal,6,Thu Jul 9 13:58:57 2015 UTC,"The Diana Mini is a great camera, my favorite from the lomography cameras I have used so far.   But, as is the case with all lomography cameras, you'll end up losing a lot of exposures, since getting aperture and focus right is mostly a matter of luck.  Having said that, the appeal of Lomo cameras gets old pretty quickly. I still have the cameras in my collection, but I barely use them.  If you want to get in the spirit advocated by lomography, to just point and shot without thinking about technique or rules. The best camera for that, IMO, is the Olympus Trip 35. It doesn't need a battery, and has a completely mechanical auto mode that works wonderfully.   By the way, you can use any film with Lomo Cameras. I would advise against using the Lomo film in general, as most scanning software don't have a profile for it, thus, making it more difficult to scan."
analog,3cnzkm,filmisfum,2,Thu Jul 9 13:46:34 2015 UTC,"As /u/jeffk42 said, the recesky tlr is a lot of fun. I built and used one last summer and it's partially what made me fall in love with film. I will say the quality sucks and the keeper rate is not always good, but when I got it right it felt great.  To be honest though, I would advise against dumping lots of money into lomography this early on. You might find that it isn't your thing or you might find that that is your niche. But as for me, I know I've spent a lot of money on lomography and now wish I saved that money for more serious film gear. Also lomography sells mostly overpriced things anyway. For instance you can buy a lubitel 166 for 20 bucks on ebay, or a couple hundred bucks on lomography. They also don't make any of the lomo branded film... It's all repackaged film."

If you do get one, make sure it's been tested or CLA'd (clean, lube, adjust)  Also the canonet (and many other cameras of the 60s-70s) use mercury batteries which are no longer produced. Alternatives are made such as wein cell batteries.  Whatever you decide on, research it thoroughly."
