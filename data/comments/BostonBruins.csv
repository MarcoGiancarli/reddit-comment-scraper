BostonBruins,3dzlwl,lechuck333,9,Mon Jul 20 20:48:59 2015 UTC,This makes no sense.  You're saying they're looking for a position that needs a huge amount of help just for the sake of helping the team?  There aren't many other options out there via free agency.
BostonBruins,3dzlwl,crazydogggz,6,Mon Jul 20 20:56:33 2015 UTC,"That's not what I mean. I mean they're settling. Ehrhoff isn't going to help.  Honestly, I'd rather them try out a player from the minors, than waste money on another aging defenseman. Ehrhoff is 33. There's enough 30+ defensemen on the Bruins. Keeping the players in the minors isn't going to help their development either. At some point, you have to bring them up, or you'll be wasting their talent. You might as well bring them up if they can help fill in a gap.  I'd rather go with a Providence player, and if it doesn't work, try to get someone at trade deadline."
BostonBruins,3dzlwl,lechuck333,2,Mon Jul 20 21:08:04 2015 UTC,"We probably won't get Ehrhoff so I wouldn't worry about it too much.    The Bruins are trying to make the playoffs this season and with the current D, they won't.  They need some help and that's why they are still talking to Franson.    We don't have anybody in Providence that can step up this year that will give you anything close to what Franson will except maybe C. Miller."
BostonBruins,3dzlwl,crazydogggz,5,Mon Jul 20 21:13:42 2015 UTC,"Who says we don't have anyone in Providence? There were guys they trusted last year to bring up (although they didn't have much of a choice). There were guys like Morrow and Trotman who came up. All it takes is one guy to step up. I never even heard anyone mention Seth Griffith before last year, and he made impressions on a lot of people. Hell, Claude wouldn't trust Spooner with a hockey stick, but he stepped up. And I haven't even heard any discussion of where Matt Irwin would go (too good to leave in the minors). There are guys in the system.  Of course, I wouldn't be opposed to Franson. I'd much prefer him over Ehrhoff (since they'd at least sign Franson into his prime). For me, it's Franson, or see who steps up."
BostonBruins,3dzlwl,lechuck333,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:19:58 2015 UTC,Who says I said we have nobody in Providence?  I said we don't have anybody that can help this defense as it is.  You bring up Griffith who was sent back to Providence after sucking and Spooner who many Bruins fans including myself were dying to see given a fair chance for a couple of years.  You mention Trotman who in my opinion is going to be on the team as it is now but I doubt Morrow makes it.    What I'm trying to get across is that the defense right now is bottom 10 in the league.  Nobody in Providence is going to save it.
BostonBruins,3dzlwl,crazydogggz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:27:46 2015 UTC,"People have such little faith in our defense. We lost one guy this offseason, and suddenly we're bottom 10? We had at least one defenseman out during last season, for basically the entirety of the season (including our top 2 guys at some point), and the Bruins were still top 10 in goals against (and that's not just Rask's work). They aren't as bad as you think."

BostonBruins,3dzlwl,gasfarmer,2,Tue Jul 21 02:15:22 2015 UTC,Our defense has been a tire fire that's getting bigger and bigger by the season  Now we have to fill Boychuk AND Hamilton's spots. We'll have to find a replacement for Seides too if he doesn't get his shit together.
BostonBruins,3dzlwl,lechuck333,3,Mon Jul 20 23:00:05 2015 UTC,"The defense wasn't our problem last year. Like I said, we were 8th in Goals Against last year. The problem was the offense. That was where the Bruins were in the bottom ten, when the Bruins used to be the top 10 in both. No that there are some new guys that can potentially score, and the dead weight's been moved, there's a chance that the offensive problems have been fixed."
BostonBruins,3dzlwl,bwadams12,4,Mon Jul 20 23:27:15 2015 UTC,"The defense wasn't our problem last year. Like I said, we were 8th in Goals Against last year.   I feel like a lot of the problem offensively started with the D last year.  There were a lot of guys who, while playing shut down in their own zone, weren't able to turn the play up ice.  Seidenberg in particular.  Hamilton was one of the few who could, and I feel like that's where we're going to feel his loss the most, in transition."
BostonBruins,3dzlwl,crazydogggz,-1,Tue Jul 21 01:58:54 2015 UTC,I was going to say bottom 5 but I gave them credit.  The system that the Bruins play helps with the goals against.  There's a reason why Bergeron won the Selke.  I understand that you're trying to be optimistic and I appreciate that but the only true bright spot I see on the D is Krug and he's a bottom pairing guy.

BostonBruins,3dv15a,SpywareAgen7,0,Mon Jul 20 16:03:45 2015 UTC,"I like Seidenberg more, but while it's a bit of a lateral move in talent, it would probably be best for the team going forward.    Trading Seidenberg (34 years old) to sign Franson (27 years old) gets the Bruins younger, potentially cheaper (Seidenberg is $4.5m for the next 2 years), out from under a declining Seidenberg's contract that has 3 years left on it, and could yield an OK return in the trade.  It wouldn't be a huge impact transition on the ice this year, but barring a Franson collapse or significant overpay, it positions the Bruins a lot better going forward."

BostonBruins,3dv15a,CoOlBeAnSs,11,Sun Jul 19 20:06:08 2015 UTC,"Now that Lucic is gone, who will make sure that the pucks get saved for the kids' first NHL goals....  Looch always seemed to be on the ice to pick up the pucks last year."
BostonBruins,3dv15a,theitgrunt,5,Sun Jul 19 20:44:44 2015 UTC,"Kelly is a great leader. He does have a steep price, but you dont find many like him who know how to lead by example, mentors kids well, and does what it takes to help the team win. People forget how good of an all around player Kelly is just by his contract. More importantly, he's reliable. I just want him to injure his face again because the full face helmet Kelly is the scoring Kelly haha. Would be nice if he scored a bit more!"
BostonBruins,3dv15a,CoOlBeAnSs,7,Sun Jul 19 20:48:19 2015 UTC,"If I'm Sweeney/Julien, I keep Kelly as long as possible just for a left-handed faceoff man and the penalty kill"
BostonBruins,3dv15a,theitgrunt,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:51:26 2015 UTC,"After this contract, if his level of play keeps up I wouldn't MI d a couple year deal at less money, I believe the cba allows a veteran of a certain age to sign at lower salary than it does for younger players."
BostonBruins,3dv15a,sicktip,2,Sun Jul 19 22:38:33 2015 UTC,"Nothing to do with the CBA, but that seems to be the way it works because of the value the GMs place on specific types of players at certain ages. Generally speaking younger promising players will be in the NHL, looking like future first liners and getting higher pay; whereas proportionally more bottom 6 players will come up later, and demand a lower salary. I agree guys like Kelly are important, because what is a good 5 on 5 and power play team if your PK is a sieve. We need guys like Kells but only on the 4th line."
BostonBruins,3dv15a,zacpz,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:34:27 2015 UTC,I though the next contract could only be a set percentage lower than  the last unless a player was a certain age the a veteran rule comes into place.
BostonBruins,3dv15a,sicktip,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:36:28 2015 UTC,"The only examples I can think of with the player taking much less money are after buyouts, so it wouldnt surprise me if this was true. Im going to have to admit not knowing this one!"
BostonBruins,3dv15a,zacpz,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:49:10 2015 UTC,I think that's only for qualifying offers for RFA's.
BostonBruins,3dv15a,spitzigsass,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:28:02 2015 UTC,"After losing Seguin and Hamilton because of character issues, and two disappointing season ends in a row hinging on lack of effort, I don't think anyone in the locker room right now deserves the benefit of the doubt on ""leadership.""  Fact of the matter is that he's a borderline third line guy making 3.5 million a year.  If we can trade an expensive bottom line center to free up space for a top-pairing D man, I'm for it."
BostonBruins,3dv15a,bwadams12,6,Mon Jul 20 01:10:29 2015 UTC,2 bad seasons? You mean a presidents trophy and a 90+ point season playoff miss? We had injuries to our top C practically all year. If we just pulled out a couple more wins in the shootout we would have made the playoffs. This team is far from disappointing...there is tons of character and leadership. Ive seen Franson play..Im a Leafs fan before a Bruin fan. He isnt that special except for the powerplay... Seids is better no question. As soon as Kellys contract expires then we can sign him for less...I doubt he will leave. He has always been a fixture of the Bruins room since we got him.
BostonBruins,3dv15a,CoOlBeAnSs,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:01:54 2015 UTC,"I agree for the most part.  Kelly isn't needed on this team and is just keeping the team from signing somebody else or from prospects getting a shot.    People act like Kelly is on this team because the Bruins management loves him too much.  They appreciate him but the reason he's still on this team is due to his NTC.  Out of the teams that he will agree to go to, none of them can or want to take him."
BostonBruins,3dv15a,crazydogggz,0,Mon Jul 20 21:00:04 2015 UTC,You lose Kelly you lose a lot of the leadership    There are already enough leaders on this team. Kelly is redundant at this point in terms of leadership and on the actual ice when it comes to the game of hockey he doesn't have much to offer. Add on the fact that he is overpaid. Kelly has to be moved if possible.
BostonBruins,3dv15a,bostonbruins922,2,Tue Jul 21 16:38:23 2015 UTC,@TheHockeyPress:   2015-07-18 16:55:21 UTC  BREAKING NHL NEWS: The Boston Bruins are talking with CAR/ARZ to free up space to finally sign Franson. (VERY CLOSE). pic.twitter.com [Imgur]     [Mistake?] [Suggestion] [FAQ] [Code] [Issues]
BostonBruins,3dv15a,TweetPoster,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:16:59 2015 UTC,"Arizona makes sense since they'll be likely willing to take anything to get above the floor. Plus there's no chance they're competitive, even if they bring up all 3 of Duclair, Domi and Strome."
BostonBruins,3dv15a,GodTuukka,2,Sun Jul 19 20:23:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah that'd make sense, and in context with the rumor before, it somewhat makes sense for Carolina to trade for Seidenberg because they could use a stay at home defenseman without a lot of term. He'd also be a good mentor for Hanifin.   Honestly, as far as Arizona goes, I'm excited to see Duclair, Domi, and Strome. I think they could do a lot to bring in people to Yotes games. If they could all be on the same line, I could see Arizona being the next Calgary as far as young talent goes."
BostonBruins,3dv15a,Hirschel,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:53:13 2015 UTC,"A post in /r/hockey recently stated that only Nashville (?) was still below the floor. I'm on mobile/busy so I can't check, but I'm certain that (according to that /r/hockey link) Arizona and Carolina aren't worried about the floor - at least not this year."
BostonBruins,3dv15a,GodTuukka,2,Sun Jul 19 22:19:05 2015 UTC,Ah right. I believe Nashville is also going to be above the floor as they're still in arbitration with Wilson and Smith.
BostonBruins,3dv15a,spitzigsass,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:20:49 2015 UTC,Carolina could be worried about the floor if they get serious about trading staal this year.
BostonBruins,3dv15a,Hirschel,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:55:59 2015 UTC,"Ahh, yes very fair point - l didn't consider a team potentially losing cap with moves."
BostonBruins,3dv15a,CowardlyDodge,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:56:27 2015 UTC,"just duclair and domi next year for them, strome has some way to go"
BostonBruins,3dv15a,lechuck333,2,Sun Jul 19 23:44:51 2015 UTC,I thought Nashville was still under the floor (correct me if I'm wrong). Wouldn't it make more sense to trade with them?
BostonBruins,3dv15a,SuburbanHell,2,Sun Jul 19 20:45:38 2015 UTC,"They are, but RFA signings on their team will push them over the floor, and they have a shit ton of talent to sign after this off-season, so they're saving. If they took anything, it'd be one year contracts for nothing. Even then, I think they might have an internal cap so they're not keen on just taking on more money if not absolutely necessary."
BostonBruins,3dv15a,PainfulPeanutBlender,2,Sun Jul 19 20:48:05 2015 UTC,"So THIS is why we overpaid McQuaid. It all makes sense now.  Seriously though this is like the 10th time we've heard something like this recently, Ed has it right, total grain of salt tweet."
BostonBruins,3dv15a,zacpz,4,Mon Jul 20 10:37:36 2015 UTC,"Isn't trading Seids for a Franson deal kind of a lateral move? We're adding one to subtract another when its not even clear who's better for Boston, we need to be just adding one. We still haven't filled the Boychuk or Dougie holes.  I still think everyone's kind of on the Franson kool-aid because of the relatively weak free agency. I'm fine with signing him, just don't want to lose Seids yet or overpay for Franson"
BostonBruins,3dv15a,PainfulPeanutBlender,9,Sun Jul 19 22:22:19 2015 UTC,"I think there's kind of a few angles here though. So first you'd have to think there are two camps: one who thinks Seidenberg will bounce back, and another who thinks he won't. To the camp who thinks he'll bounce back, it doesn't make sense to move him and go for Franson, and that's pretty much the bottom line. To the other, he's 33 and makes $4m and is signed until 2018 where his decline will continue. Franson shouldn't make much more than $4, probably somewhere between that and $5m, so he's slightly more expensive but he's also 27, has much more offensive pedigree, and is a right handed shot, which we need desperately. So the idea is that Franson can move into Hamilton's PP slot and would be effective there. He is also capable of playing top 4, considering he was on Toronto's top pairing with Phaneuf before he got traded, and hopefully if he does sign here, Claude can whip him into shape when it comes to defensive responsibility. So there's a lot of conditional aspects to these moves that change whether or not one favors them. I'm not lecturing you, I'm sure you know all this, I'm just saying I can kind of see both side's arguments here."
BostonBruins,3dv15a,PatriotVirus,2,Sun Jul 19 22:33:36 2015 UTC,"I agree entirely on most of your points, but the problem I see with this is the idea of him having to take extra defensive responsibility. As much as I see Seids dong worse than him defensively this year, and claudes system will make Franson look alot less offensive, as well as Franson not being a lot less physical."
BostonBruins,3dv15a,throck_star,3,Sun Jul 19 23:28:37 2015 UTC,"OK, thats all well and good. I see why some people want Franson as he's arguably the best defenseman left but that's kind of a different point than I was trying to make.  My point here is if we trade Seids away for cap space we're filling a hole and creating another. I get the risks surrounding Seids, I think he will bounce back and we don't have to hang on to him for the rest of his contract. If he doesn't bounce back he'll be more difficult to move, so I get the argument from the other crowd too. But to that id say what happens if we sign Franson for more and he ends up tanking in Boston too? I liked him better on Toronto, Nashville he didn't seem quite as good and god knows how he'll fit here.  There's too many 'what ifs' here, I get the idea of wanting Franson I just don't quite get why we send Seids away at the same time"
BostonBruins,3dv15a,Lopezc2c,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:58:31 2015 UTC,"seids based on contract length alone, I mean in three years he's going to be significantly worse. I just don't see who you'd put on that 2nd pairing if you let him go."
BostonBruins,3dv15a,throck_star,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:24:47 2015 UTC,I really hope we dont sign Franson
BostonBruins,3dv15a,Easy2Envy,4,Sun Jul 19 19:22:17 2015 UTC,Why?
BostonBruins,3dv15a,ihennebe,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:42:27 2015 UTC,Two reasons:   I dont see him as a solid 2nd pair guy. His defensive play is not confidence inspiring. Unless he signs a 1 year contract he serves only to make our defensive logjam worse. If he signs a 1 year contract what good is he while we retool? Might as well give the prospects more ice time.
BostonBruins,3dv15a,wateryoudoinghere,-4,Sun Jul 19 23:33:35 2015 UTC,"Because who on our roster is worth trading to sign him? I can only agree with a lower pairing Dman (K.Miller, Trotman). Trading a forward opens up another gap, and trading Siedenburg is a lateral move."
BostonBruins,3dv15a,zacpz,10,Sun Jul 19 22:12:16 2015 UTC,In no way is swapping Seidenberg for Franson a lateral move
BostonBruins,3dv15a,wateryoudoinghere,3,Sun Jul 19 22:42:57 2015 UTC,"As someone who doesn't know Cody Franson from Adam... Who's a better d-man, and what's Franson's style of play like?"
BostonBruins,3dv15a,CowardlyDodge,5,Sun Jul 19 23:24:50 2015 UTC,"Cody plays a much more offensive game. On the Leafs in the top pairing he put up mad points, but with little defensive responsibility or prowess. In Nashville he played third pairing minutes he played against players who were less of an offensive threat and dropped massively in points.  The point I would make is that in a defensive system, Franson seems to offer much less, and has never proved he can suceed with defensive responsibility, which our systems are based around.  The reason people are saying its a lateral move is that Siedenberg is a player that knows the systems, is at best a bounce back solid D-man, and at worst isnt less of a leak than Franson. Franson is at best A PP guy and 2nd pairing D-man, and at worst a leaky hole in our D corps overfilled with 3rd pairing guys. from a Cap perspective this move is seen by a lot of people as making no difference to the overall success of a team, hence this being lateral, or sideways move"
BostonBruins,3dv15a,Lopezc2c,4,Sun Jul 19 23:41:45 2015 UTC,Thanks dude! You really broke it down nicely and I learned something

It was great as a second or third layer jersey when playing roller hockey in the summer when I was in goal. That big ass bear head was practically a chest protector."
BostonBruins,3dquxc,GodTuukka,26,Sun Jul 19 02:51:29 2015 UTC,I still think that's the ugliest non-habs jersey in the NHL.

BostonBruins,3dquxc,PuckTheHabs,2,Sun Jul 19 04:11:38 2015 UTC,"The L.A. ""Burger King"" jersey was pretty bad. The Anaheim Ducks' ""Wild Wing"" jersey is just absolutely insane. The Islanders ""Fisherman"" jersey was a stone cold atrocity. The Dallas Stars had a weird combination of intimidating and an acid trip on a jersey from 2003-2006. The Nasvhille Predators had this hideous/amazing mustard alternates, which I need to own. Not even Jack Eichel could make these Buffalo Slug Sabre jerseys look good. I'm not even sure this Phoenix Coyotes jersey is bad. It's just...something special. The Vancouver Canucks just done pooched up too many times in their history when it came to jerseys.

BostonBruins,3drf56,x_Zoyle_Love_Life_x,4,Sat Jul 18 19:01:07 2015 UTC,"I looked for a mention on him in recap articles but I couldn't find much. We had 37 prospects at camp (a holy number around these parts btw), which is an unheard of number for us, so it's harder to dedicate time in articles to each player. They basically just want to recap the top end players that will generate buzz. I'd tweet at Joe Haggerty, Matt Kalman, DJ Bean or Amalie Benjamin, as they will be able to give you a run down on how he did. I've been relying on their tweets for updates from camp, and I think they've done an amazing job. They went through the entire development camp. I ordinarily don't recommend Haggerty because he tends to be a bit sensationalist, but his coverage on dev camp has been very good. Matt Kalman runs the Bruins Blog and writes for CBS and nhl.com, and is usually decent at writeups. DJ Bean is the Bruins correspondent for WEEI and also has good writeups. Amalie Benjamin writes for NHL.com and runs the Bruins page, as well as writing for NESN and the Boston Globe. They are all excellent journalists and are usually pretty good about answering tweets."

BostonBruins,3dqi3k,Y2JAMIE,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:32:14 2015 UTC,Yeah but that was also a baseball stadium which has much lower seats. This one is at a football stadium and the first row of seats are at least 5 feet higher than the Fenway ones.

The Bruins might do somwthing similar. Otherwise you can use stubhub and expect to pay at least $500"

A great majority of us, myself included, rushed to judgment before we saw the grand scheme play out. I'm not really sold on Franson myself. I'd like him if we don't overpay for him...which is why I don't think we've signed him yet. I wouldn't be averse to passing on a D-man to sign Alexander Semin though."
BostonBruins,3dp857,biffpz,4,Sat Jul 18 03:33:22 2015 UTC,"I feel like signing Semin would be a knee jerk move just to get a skilled (albeit lazy) offense moving and maybe encourage the guys trying to make the jump to work harder but I'd only like it if we signed him for cheap and didn't bring us too many cap troubles. But if he is what Sween is looking for, guys who want to be in Boston, I'd say sign him and make sure he plays to his full potential."

BostonBruins,3dp857,biffpz,2,Sat Jul 18 07:56:23 2015 UTC,A surplus at RW? I believe we have a deficit. Eriksson is a natural LW btw
BostonBruins,3dp857,ThunderRoad5,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:12:10 2015 UTC,"Pasta, Connoly, Hayes, Eriksson( as you said can play LW), And if we need a RW we can call up Griffith , a cheaper and no risk option. RHD? McQuaid.   Edit- And at LW we have Belesky, Marchand, Eriksson, Talbot and Rinaldo. I dont think we traded for Rinaldo to keep him in a press box for the whole season so I think he he staying on the 4th line. That means our LWs will most likely be all I listed and Eriksson will just stay at RW to play on the Bergy or Krejci Line."
BostonBruins,3dp857,Easy75,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:16:30 2015 UTC,"I said Eriksson is a natural LW, which means he moved over to RW when he came to Boston. He is more productive at LW."

BostonBruins,3dp857,SuburbanHell,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:14:18 2015 UTC,Do you think Miller (both) are ready for a Top4 role? Colin i dont think is making the Nhl this year and I think Kevin is staying with McQuaid at the bottom pairing. Trotman i guess you could pair with Chara and see how it goes. I reall dont want McQuaid playong top 4 minutes either
BostonBruins,3dp857,PainfulPeanutBlender,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:15:53 2015 UTC,"Kevan Miller is a solid stay at home defenseman, so I don't think his existence as a 2nd line RD is concerning. I guess my point was that a couple of the wingers you mentioned don't deserve top 9 minutes, so not including Kevan and Trotman was a bit harsh. Regardless, I agree that RD is our biggest need, and thankfully I think the organization agrees with that."
BostonBruins,3dp857,SuburbanHell,2,Sun Jul 19 02:27:36 2015 UTC,As well he should be.  RHD is a definite need right now.  Gotta replace Dougie & Destroychuk.  We can't afford to NOT sign Franson in the position we're in.
BostonBruins,3dp857,sixtensodapants17,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:12:57 2015 UTC,"Of course we could afford not to, we don't want to throw a stupid contract just to fill a hole like that. Short sighted decisions lead to bad contracts, Franson needs to be here if the price is right.   I trust Sweeney on that decision when it comes to $$, I'd rather look at our prospect pool for the next one up than to be put back in cap jail"
BostonBruins,3dp857,SuburbanHell,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:45:42 2015 UTC,"Well yes I've been saying that all along - given the clear market correction that has taken place, I think Franson can be had for anywhere between 3.8 and 4.25 aav.    If they structure the contract so he gets a little less up front and a little more on the back end, Chara or Seidenberg will be gone by then and that way he's completely affordable to sign now without having to move anyone else."
BostonBruins,3dp857,PezDOY,-2,Sun Jul 19 12:05:42 2015 UTC,The Bruins CAN afford not to sign Franson. I just don't understand the need and desperation for this under average slow not physical and no more than a 5th or 6th dman on most teams. You dummies know why he still isn't signed because he sucks and over valued himself and the market. He is a dime a dozen defenseman that couldn't play in Toronto and isn't any better in nashville.

BostonBruins,3dmw45,Ajrob2128,55,Fri Jul 17 15:48:54 2015 UTC,"The scrimmage was high scoring there was not a ton of defense. But as far as Carlo goes....for someone being 6'5 he skates like hes 5'11. Hes very agile and it doesnt look forced and he has decent closing speed as well he was closing on top of some of the other prospects much faster than i think they anticipated.  Zboril had very good first passes. Which is exciting becuase thats what we need. He also wasnt getting outmuscled too bad in the corners.  Zane- The goalies tried but it was hard to get a bead on their play given it was back and forth and there was not a ton of defense but Zane made some good saves.  Vladar, looked like an 18 year old, but this kid eats up the crease due to his size alone. He does remind me a lot of ben bishop. Just how he utilizes his size.  Just a disclaimer im no expert, these are my personal observations from the scrimmage but I really like Heinen and Carlo the most."

Fast as hell  Debrusk was a concern as he was almost unnoticeable.  I had to look for him to see he was out there.   Jesse Gabrielle really stood out to me.  For a scrimmage he was hitting hard and quite a pest.  He toned it down later.  Great speed, not a strong finisher but i liked him a lot"

BostonBruins,3dmw45,aced,9,Fri Jul 17 16:02:21 2015 UTC,"Debrusk has been pretty quiet until the shootout portion he had a sick between the legs backhand shootout goal, and also Donato looks nasty so far.  One of the players that i liked really flew under the radar but had a great showing on the little things was JFK Forsbacca Karlson spelling is wrong lol he reminds me of patrice a lot all the little things very well and the O will come later  Also sean Kuraly, (traded from sharks) is a very good big bodied center, he is going back to college for his senior year, but i hope the bruins can sign him. He has been a great all around player."

BostonBruins,3dmy4q,Thecardinal74,2,Fri Jul 17 16:25:40 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure Malik went through his legs. Debrusk went around both of his legs which is a lot harder.

He was a drain during 5v5  It's good that he has a kind of skill, but I'd rather not waste the roster spot for 60 minutes so we can have someone do well in the shootout. I'd rather have someone that helps us to win before we GET to the shootout  Delete he'll be great five on five and still be able to do this in the shootout if it comes to it"

The one thing that's clear is he and Cam want to restore the identity of Boston being a team that is hard to play against. This will mean people will be expected to hit, fight, block shots, and be a pain in the ass. Cam/Sweeney have also expressed the sentiment that a player must have a desire to play in Boston for them to be a good fit. This narrative fits with the Hamilton trade."

I haven't seen anybody mention playoffs so far, so I'll give it a shot. Last year, our playoff push was halted by a hot Ottawa team and a plethora of underperformances from key players on our team. This year, playoffs are kind of up in the air; we're attempting to push out some of the dead wood, and our general performance over the coming season is very much dependent on the ability of our youngsters from last season (Pasta, Spoons) and unproven prospects to step it up."

BostonBruins,3dmrxj,Wizard4877,2,Fri Jul 17 21:05:50 2015 UTC,"Trotman and Morrow are two solid defensive prospects that played in a handful of NHL games last season. Both have impressed with our AHL affiliate, and I wouldn't be surprised to see them given more of a chance this year. Colin Miller is another dman that we acquired through the Lucic trade, and although he boasted the fastest speed and shot at the AHL skills competition, but most think that he needs a bit more time to develop before he's NHL ready. Forwards-wise, we have young players such as Khokhalachev and Griffith who could slot nicely into our 4th or 3rd lines. Our draft class is solid despite the complaints surrounding them, yet they all need to spend some time proving themselves in the AHL before they're called up. As far as NHL-proven prospects go, Pasta and Spoons are our only two, but I'm optimistic that some of the aforementioned prospects can follow in their footsteps."

BostonBruins,3dl6ol,Easy2Envy,2,Fri Jul 17 04:33:50 2015 UTC,I was about to disagree with the Spooner part but you're right. 3v3 Spoons may get burned a bit easier.

BostonBruins,3dj9mm,Easy75,13,Thu Jul 16 18:45:28 2015 UTC,"Unless the organization is REALLY expecting Trotman, Morrow or Colin Miller to make the team and compete for a Top 4 spot, I'm not sure how this helps outside of cap relief.

BostonBruins,3dj9mm,NUKEFreeman,3,Thu Jul 16 19:32:25 2015 UTC,"I would rather have McQuaid kept on the bottom pairing with Krug.  Then have this for your defense pairings (assuming this rumor isn't bullshit):  Chara - Trotman  Morrow - Franson Krug - McQuaid  That second pairing is a little un-seasoned, but I think it could work out.  Swap in C. Miller for Trotman depending on how he looks in camp."
BostonBruins,3dj9mm,rowsdower726,6,Thu Jul 16 19:36:52 2015 UTC,"That line up is what I was thinking, except maybe switching Krug and Morrow because of Krug's experience and the hopes he continues to develop into a Top 4 role.  Trotman played well with Chara at the end of the season when Hamilton was out.  If this is our lineup to begin the season, I'll take it.  Don't love it, but I'd rather give Morrow and Trotman (or Colin Miller) a shot in the lineup instead of veterans like Irwin and Kevan Miller that aren't going to develop into anything more than what they are."
BostonBruins,3dj9mm,NUKEFreeman,5,Thu Jul 16 19:43:02 2015 UTC,"I would be interested in seeing Krug playing in the Top 4.  He seems to struggle defensively at times, but he can move the puck really well, so I don't know.  I certainly wouldn't be opposed to giving him the chance to shine, that's for sure."
BostonBruins,3dj9mm,rowsdower726,5,Thu Jul 16 19:46:29 2015 UTC,"I don't think Krug is, or projects to be a top 4 guy. He's great in his role, but he doesn't have the defensive coverage ability to handle top 4. Morrow may be less seasoned, but he could at least project to be that top 4 guy."
BostonBruins,3dj9mm,Wheezin_Ed,2,Thu Jul 16 21:16:12 2015 UTC,"I agree. Morrow projects to be more of a two way player, and in Krug's case, i think if he plays more regular minutes you will not be able to deploy him as often in purely offensive situations and you will actually be wasting some of his value. His true skill set is that of a creator. I don't think he's terrible defensively, but you don't want to trade minutes of excellent offense for mediocre defense."
BostonBruins,3dj9mm,Levesque77,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:49:37 2015 UTC,I'd slot in Irwin over both Trotman and Morrow. More offensive upside and more experience in the NHL. Trotman is the pressbox DMan and Morrow gets more time in the AHL.
BostonBruins,3dj9mm,silax1,5,Fri Jul 17 14:02:42 2015 UTC,If this were the case I suppose I'd be ok with it. I just can't believe that Seidenberg is as bad as he was last year. I might be totally wrong but I just have this feeling he's going to have a bounceback year this year. I would like to see them add to this group rather than just swapping guys in and out.   If you swap out Seidenberg for Franson and then add a piece then I'd like it a lot more. It's just that if a couple things work out for you this year and you catch some breaks you're right back in it.
BostonBruins,3dj9mm,Sixchr,5,Thu Jul 16 18:54:23 2015 UTC,"I've had a man-crush on Seidenberg since he played against us in 2009, loved his performance for the Canes. But it's hard to rebound from a major knee injury in your mid-30's. Granted he's a fitness freak on an almost Chara-like level so that increases his chances, but still, I consider a return to form for him to be kind of a long shot."
BostonBruins,3dj9mm,Sixchr,2,Thu Jul 16 19:22:52 2015 UTC,"He'll never be what he was but last year wasn't just the physical stuff, he just looked like he had no idea how to play anymore. I just can't grasp any understanding of how that happened."
BostonBruins,3dj9mm,xBlackLogic,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:21:29 2015 UTC,"Right to eh end of the season, you could still see his lack of ability to properly pivot, limiting his options and leading to some pray and dump plays that had me screaming at my monitor.   I would take a bag of pucks for him at this point."
BostonBruins,3dj9mm,lechuck333,5,Fri Jul 17 00:41:33 2015 UTC,"I'd rather gamble on Seidenberg bouncing back than Franson. Seidenberg was meh after coming back from an injury, Franson was meh when perfectly healthy on a playoff team."
BostonBruins,3dj9mm,JohnnyRussell,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:28:51 2015 UTC,Coming back from an injury? I'd say he was fully recovered by the time we needed him to step up in April of last year
BostonBruins,3dj9mm,lechuck333,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:41:36 2015 UTC,Oh I agree. He looked more like himself at the end of the year (although I doubt he'll ever be as dominant as he once was). I was referring to mainly the start.
BostonBruins,3dj9mm,JohnnyRussell,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:48:30 2015 UTC,"Ah. Yes but Franson was just one point shy of Krug I believe, so offensively he'd help, put him with Chara and that's a good balance"
BostonBruins,3dj9mm,lechuck333,-2,Thu Jul 16 21:50:03 2015 UTC,"We don't need the offense. Sweeney got some offensive players. Right now, I think it's better to get someone defensive, and Franson isn't the best defensive defenseman in the league. He wasn't even the best on Toronto (and that's saying a lot)."
BostonBruins,3dj9mm,bruins4777,2,Thu Jul 16 21:53:16 2015 UTC,"You need a cohesive unit to produce offense, score, and generally have a successful team. It's not as simple as ""you have x offensive players, now we need y defense players to form a team."" If your D can't move the puck to the forwards with consistency then it screws up your entire game.   The bruins currently have one d who can skate and move the puck. They need more."
BostonBruins,3dj9mm,JohnnyRussell,3,Fri Jul 17 01:44:20 2015 UTC,Well our other two RD's are super defensive (I'm assuming it'll be McQuaid and Miller) So I figure we'd need one offensive D
BostonBruins,3dj9mm,throck_star,2,Thu Jul 16 21:54:35 2015 UTC,"Neither McQauid, Miller, or Franson is fit to play with Chara. It will likely be Trotman or C. Miller to develop them"
BostonBruins,3dj9mm,JohnnyRussell,2,Fri Jul 17 00:07:50 2015 UTC,For some reason Trotman plays well with Chara
BostonBruins,3dj9mm,throck_star,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:01:45 2015 UTC,"For me thats a ""dont overthink it"" situation. Trots was looking pretty good at seasons end"
BostonBruins,3dj9mm,dellstrom,16,Fri Jul 17 03:53:04 2015 UTC,"This doesn't make sense. If Franson works out great, this is a lateral move... It's filling a hole by filling it with dirt from a new hole. The hole is still there. We need Seids AND Franson/other top4 D. Seids is on our second pairing for sure... wouldn't it make more sense to trade the 4th liner that's going to make 3m next year, especially when we have someone like Kemppainen who can fill his void?"
BostonBruins,3dj9mm,jonny_lube,27,Thu Jul 16 19:05:39 2015 UTC,"It's a lateral move in talent, but it gets the Bruins younger, potentially cheaper (Seidenberg is $4.5m for the next 2 years), out from under a declining Seidenberg's contract that has 3 years left on it, and could potentially yield an asset in the trade.   It would have a much smaller on ice impact than you'd like to see when bringing in a guy like Franson, but it would likely put us in a better position going forward."
BostonBruins,3dj9mm,throck_star,5,Thu Jul 16 19:41:44 2015 UTC,The way I see it if were signing Franson then Swee-neely wants to contend and that means we would need both of them. If its a move for the future then it still makes little sense because Seids value really cannot get any lower so you might as well wait till he plays a few games and if he improves then we can keep him and if he doesnt then we drop him at the same garbage value he has now
BostonBruins,3dj9mm,Levesque77,8,Thu Jul 16 21:40:12 2015 UTC,"It's not a lateral move in talent, though. Dennis was one of the worst dmen in the league amongst those who got similar  playing time last season. His good years are way gone. Time to ditch the bad contract if someone will take it."
BostonBruins,3dj9mm,bruins4777,3,Thu Jul 16 23:44:47 2015 UTC,Franson is an upgrade over Seidenberg.
BostonBruins,3dj9mm,dellstrom,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:41:02 2015 UTC,"Barely, if even. He was a healthy scratch a lot for Nashville. He's a decent 3/good 4. It's unfair to count Seids out after major knee surgery. He'll have all summer to work out 100%.  Which one of Franson or Seidenberg is better is not my point. We desperately need a top 4 D. I hope we do sign him, if the price is right... But getting rid of Seids in the process solves nothing."
BostonBruins,3dj9mm,bruins4777,2,Fri Jul 17 04:08:47 2015 UTC,"I'm not huge on franson either, but he is undoubtedly better than Seidenberg.  Regardless, I think getting rid of seids actually solves quite a bit. He's not a top 4 NHL dman anymore. Honestly, he wasn't playing all that well pre ACL injury. I really don't expect him to be one again. In lieu of that, getting rid of him now is addition by subtraction because of his contract. If he was on a no risk short term deal, I would agree. However, in all likelihood he's going to keep declining as he ages and only become more limited. At the moment, he is a horrible contract with the slim potential upside of being a merely bad contract. With that in mind, any means to get rid of him is a good move in my eyes.   I understand losing a veteran NHL dman, especially with the current state of the bruins dcore, is not ideal for the upcoming season. But, you can't operate on single season windows unless you're a true cup contender. Boston is nowhere near that. Compete now, build for the future."

IF we can get Franson and Morrow/Trotman/C.Miller/Irwin can step up, the pairings don't look so bad:   Chara-Franson Krug-K.Miller Providence-McQuaid   Now let's take this into February, we suddenly have Seidenberg's 4 million dollars to beef up the Defense.    Alternatively, we could keep Seidenberg, still sign Franson, and pray to god someone takes Seidenberg for some fresh legs at the deadline.  That all said, with Oduya gone, Franson has since been linked to:  Arizona, Buffalo, Calgary, Columbus, Edmonton, New Jersey, Pittsburgh, Toronto, Vancouver, AND us, so who the fuck knows."

BostonBruins,3dj9mm,SuburbanHell,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:14:36 2015 UTC,"I think, if he can stay healthy, he's better than McQuaid.  Edit:  Since I'm getting downvoted on this... My logic:    Season Team GP G A P +/- PIM PP SH GW S S%    2013-2014 Bruins 47 1 5 6 20 38 0 0 1 41 2.4   2014-2015 Bruins 41 2 5 7 20 15 0 0 1 37 5.4    This means, for an average 82 game season if he should somehow play a full year, his numbers could reach:    Season Team GP G A P +/- PIM    Full-Year Bruins 82 2.87 9.35 12.23 +37.45 48.145    Comparable to McQuaid, sure, but if we take his body of work with the Bruins and put it into an 82 game season looks something like:    Season Team GP G A P +/- PIM PP SH GW S S%    2009-2010 Bruins 19 1 0 1 -5 21 0 0 1 10 10.0   2010-2011 Bruins 67 3 12 15 30 96 0 0 0 46 6.5   2011-2012 Bruins 72 2 8 10 16 99 0 0 0 63 3.2   2012-2013 Bruins 32 1 3 4 0 60 0 0 0 26 3.8   2013-2014 Bruins 30 1 5 6 12 69 0 0 0 25 4.0   2014-2015 Bruins 63 1 6 7 -2 85 0 0 0 60 1.7      Season Team GP G A P +/- PIM    Full-Year Bruins 82 2.6 9.85 12.46 +14.77 125.59    To me, +/- has always been a key statistic in defense, and a full season of Kevan Miller is better than a full season of Adam McQuaid."
BostonBruins,3dj9mm,NUKEFreeman,6,Thu Jul 16 20:34:51 2015 UTC,"I'm glad you have faith in him, but, to me, he hasn't proven he isn't anything more than a 7th defenseman in the league.  There's a reason he didn't make his NHL debut until he was 26.  He's not very good."
BostonBruins,3dj9mm,SuburbanHell,2,Thu Jul 16 21:34:22 2015 UTC,"Well, yeah, but neither is McQuaid is my point."
BostonBruins,3dj9mm,GodTuukka,7,Thu Jul 16 21:57:55 2015 UTC,"McQuaid has at least proven he is a capable bottom pair defenseman.  He's not a Top 4 player either, but if both McQuaid and Kevan Miller are in the lineup at the same time, I think it is going to be a rough season.  They are almost identical players (McQuaid is a little better) and they just paid to keep McQuaid.  There is no need for Kevan Miller other than as a 7th defenseman.  Neither seem reliable enough to play a full season with McQuaid playing 70 games in a single NHL season once and Miller never playing more than 66 games (47 NHL and 19 AHL games last season) professionally in a season.  Miller is a nice replacement when McQuaid eventually gets hurt, but I think it is a mistake to have Miller in the lineup with McQuaid healthy and players like Trotman, Morrow and Colin Miller having much more upside than Kevan Miller."
BostonBruins,3dj9mm,SuburbanHell,2,Thu Jul 16 22:05:28 2015 UTC,"I'd love to hope for a miracle in Trotman, Morrow, and Colin Miller having such a good camp that we're talking about how they just sent McQuaid and Kevan Miller to providence, but that's just not the likelihood."
BostonBruins,3dj9mm,footninjaarcher,0,Thu Jul 16 22:12:29 2015 UTC,Yuck.   Go with something like this;  Chara/Franson  Morrow/Krug  McQuaid/Miller   The only problem with that is that Krug pairing might be a bit...leaky since both guys are more offensive oriented. Krug might be able to carry the pairing either of Morrow goes into a rut. But it does keep McQuaid and Miller out of the top 4.
BostonBruins,3dj9mm,libertypole,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:06:19 2015 UTC,"That's exactly why I put Miller there.  Gotta split up Miller & McQuaid, and Krug and any other offensive defenseman."

BostonBruins,3dj9mm,GodTuukka,6,Thu Jul 16 23:10:58 2015 UTC,"Seidenberg did not play good.

Though i'll admit that edge isn't really big enough for a dude his size.  I'd love to see what he could do alongside a mentor like Chara. If he somehow got better playing alongside captain pylon in Toronto, imagine what Z could do for him.   As for Seidenberg; his speed and somehow his brain fell off after the injury. He might have been the worst regular d-man the Bruins had last season. That's saying something with the likes of Bort getting time."

Maybe Edmonton, Nashville, Dallas, or Philly would bite on that because they have nice defensive pipelines bit not so much in goal, which is the opposite of us.

I think Goligoski might require a little bit more of a significant piece, and he would probably displace Chara on the top pairing, but I don't know how likely it is he gets moved. I think we're in decent standing to acquire a defenseman, it's more about who else is willing to deal, and that's why I was looking at teams with slim goaltending depth.

BostonBruins,3dijcn,mrwordman,7,Thu Jul 16 16:44:56 2015 UTC,"Almost everyone I've seen has him penciled in our top 6, many (myself included) slotting him next to Krejci. I don't think many people forgot about him.  I think Eriksson-Krejci-Connolly would be a good line... Balanced, all of them play a more patient game that Krejci thrives in, and Connolly gives him an elite level shot. One of my friends who follows the Bolts pretty religiously said he'd be surprised if Connolly got less than 20 goals next year."
BostonBruins,3dijcn,dellstrom,4,Thu Jul 16 19:11:35 2015 UTC,Great article. I think this is showing why he'd be perfect as Krejci's winger. I want to see what a Beleskey - Krejci - Connolly line can do.

BostonBruins,3di9f5,Ajrob2128,9,Thu Jul 16 14:16:31 2015 UTC,"Okay, but how does giving McQuaid a 3 million dollar, 4 year contract help the cap?"
BostonBruins,3di9f5,rowsdower726,3,Thu Jul 16 14:33:30 2015 UTC,"under 3 million for four years, and for the next two years im fine with that signing, he would of made more on the open market. The two years after that the first 2 i hope we move him."
BostonBruins,3di9f5,rowsdower726,2,Thu Jul 16 14:34:26 2015 UTC,"Yes, and we should have let him make more on the open market, especially with a logjam at defense."
BostonBruins,3di9f5,Levesque77,3,Thu Jul 16 14:36:06 2015 UTC,A logjam at defense? Defense is currently the biggest weakness of this team.
BostonBruins,3di9f5,rowsdower726,4,Thu Jul 16 17:56:19 2015 UTC,"It is the biggest weakness, absolutely, but we have a lot of potential defensemen that need to be playing solid minutes in order to step up their game.  Languishing in the AHL isn't going to help their development while someone who has not shown any top 4 potential takes up a spot."
BostonBruins,3di9f5,Levesque77,2,Thu Jul 16 18:06:09 2015 UTC,"The AHL has shown time and time again that it is an excellent place for development.  Seidenberg is a way bigger waste of cap space than McQuaid. I hope I'm wrong, but I think everyone expecting a bounce back from Dennis are going to be disappointed."
BostonBruins,3di9f5,rowsdower726,0,Thu Jul 16 18:14:50 2015 UTC,"The AHL is great for development, yes, but players are never going to grow if the only action they see is in there.    And yes, Seidenberg sucks, I'm not defending him.  In fact, what you're saying  is basically agreeing with my point: McQuaid and Seidenberg should not be taking up roster spots from the younger guys.    Now, obviously our younger guys need to be seasoned and probably paired with a more experienced D partner, so I'd rather have Seids with Morrow compared to Morrow + Trotman together, so to me, McQuaid is the most expendable."
BostonBruins,3di9f5,Levesque77,2,Thu Jul 16 18:21:09 2015 UTC,"McQuaid is right handed and 5 years Seidenberg's junior, and makes 1.25 million less than Seidenberg. Not to mention McQuaid is better than Seidenberg at this point. (He was last season and I don't expect it to change)  Current D-men are (Not in pairings, just in my personal depth order according to handedness):     Left Handed Right Handed    Chara McQuaid   Irwin C.Miller   Krug Trotman   Morrow K.Miller   Seidenberg     I don't see how eliminating another RH who is younger and better and significantly cheaper is the right solution. Seidenberg doesn't fit, and needs to go. Once gone, I think McQuaid has a place on this team, just hopefully not playing 20 minutes a night.  As it stands right now, without Seidenberg, Trotman is probably your 7th d-man with Krug playing the right side."
BostonBruins,3di9f5,Levesque77,2,Thu Jul 16 18:30:50 2015 UTC,trotman wont be a 7th. Hes developing and he needs to be playing its either AHL top pair or bottom pair nhl.
BostonBruins,3di9f5,rowsdower726,0,Thu Jul 16 18:59:42 2015 UTC,You are right. it will probably be K Miller.
BostonBruins,3di9f5,Levesque77,2,Thu Jul 16 19:16:56 2015 UTC,I like McQuaid.  Let me get that straight.    But he's only good on the third pairing.  He struggled with top minutes last season.  Paying him almost 3 million for the next 4 years doesn't really make sense.  Not to mention he has never played a full season.  I'd rather have Kevan Miller on the third pairing than an overpaid McQuaid.
BostonBruins,3di9f5,Easy2Envy,0,Thu Jul 16 19:06:06 2015 UTC,"I get what you are saying. I could get behind it, if it meant that Seidenberg was gone too.   The thing is, Mcquaid is not unmovable at 2.75 if someone takes his spot on the depth chart at some point in the season. Actually, he would likely be a decent trade chip at the deadline if they decided he was surplus."
BostonBruins,3di9f5,Levesque77,0,Thu Jul 16 19:20:14 2015 UTC,Seidenberg last on depth?! What are you smoking? He and Chara are the only two that have proven they can play in the top 4.
BostonBruins,3di9f5,rowsdower726,-1,Thu Jul 16 21:53:36 2015 UTC,It's my opinion of the current skill level of the defensemen they have. Seidenberg was fucking terrible last season. Players age. They don't remain constant forever. The fact that he was good in his prime is not relevant anymore.   Next time try being less of a dickhead when you respond to someone.
BostonBruins,3di9f5,silax1,2,Thu Jul 16 23:37:26 2015 UTC,"i agree were no longer the trade prospects and draft picks for nhl ready players every season or deadline. Sweeney wants to get back to developing his players, so it has to happen and id rather have it done this year!"
BostonBruins,3di9f5,xBlackLogic,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:59:05 2015 UTC,"Last season, we should have sold at the deadline and let our young guys come up and develop.  We probably still would have made the playoffs, but at least it wouldn't have been a waste of time."
BostonBruins,3di9f5,rowsdower726,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:07:33 2015 UTC,I think were moving seidenberg and thats why they kept mcquaid on. You cant have 2 returning d-men in just Chara and Krug if seidenberg is moved.

BostonBruins,3dhz75,Miketeh,3,Thu Jul 16 14:28:45 2015 UTC,"Trotman could crack the lineup full time.  We swapped 7th rounders in 2010 to get him at last overall, looking like a great trade/acquisition.  I'm excited to see Arnesson, seems to trend toward a Seidenberg-type player with more upside.  I think our defense will be great again in 2-3 years, like OP.  Rask will still be great, Bergy will still be great, and Krejci will still be great."

BostonBruins,3dhz75,Wheezin_Ed,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:36:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah the O'Gara pick is a really nice one. A DMan with his size and some/any scoring touch is a great asset. As prospects go, he's on the older side, but he's looking like a good bet to crack the full-time roster at some point and could have top-4 potential.   The only problem with O'Gara as far as the Bruins are concerned is his age and that he didn't make the jump to the AHL this year, so he'll be reaching UFA status relatively quickly after turning pro. He's still got two significant jumps to make (NCAA --> AHL, AHL --> NHL), and he'll have to do all that AND become a meaningful contributor before he becomes a UFA after the 2020-2021 season. Since he loses the 2015-2016 season to Yale, he'll have five seasons to jump two levels and, hopefully, become a solid contributor at the NHL level at some point along the line."
BostonBruins,3dhz75,ElderlySouls,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:26:30 2015 UTC,"The real problem is that our defensive depth isn't that high end. We have a multitude of prospects that project as bottom pairing, but not many top 4. Arnesson, Morrow, O'Gara and Zboril have top 4 potential, but not much else. And that is just potential. They may not pan out that way."
BostonBruins,3dhqjo,SamT323,14,Thu Jul 16 11:03:06 2015 UTC,"Its Orr, Esposito, Bucyk, and Bourque. I love Chara and Bergeron, but I would probably even put Shore and Neely over them."
BostonBruins,3dhqjo,j2thek47,3,Thu Jul 16 13:40:47 2015 UTC,I agree with your list. I have no idea how someone could justify having Bergy and Chara in the 4 with the guys you mentioned not in it.
BostonBruins,3dhqjo,jwally33,2,Thu Jul 16 13:49:28 2015 UTC,"I love Bergy but let's pump the breaks a little.  We have players in our franchise who are all-time greats.  They were the hands down no questions asked best players in the league when they played, and they are still some of the best players in NHL history.  I love Bergeron, but he is neither of those.  I think at one point you could have argued that Chara was the best Dman in the league, but it was not a no-brainer like Orr or Bourque, and he will not go down as one of the all-time greats like they have."
BostonBruins,3dhqjo,j2thek47,2,Thu Jul 16 15:03:06 2015 UTC,I agree 100%
BostonBruins,3dhqjo,jwally33,2,Thu Jul 16 15:40:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah agreed. Bergy is great but exactly, we have all-time greats in our history and Bergy just is not one of them."

BostonBruins,3dhqjo,mjferr18,2,Thu Jul 16 20:24:13 2015 UTC,One that slipped my mind until I saw it last night was Milt Schmidt. I feel like he should absolutely be on there.
BostonBruins,3dhqjo,Sixchr,7,Thu Jul 16 18:57:16 2015 UTC,"Locks:   Orr: Best player ever, needs no argument. Bourque: Bruins leader in points, 1 PPG as a defensemen. 5 Norris trophies. Eddie Shore: 4 Hart trophies seems to speak for itself.   Best of the rest:   Espo: Insane highs (76G in 70') and great overall stats (1.6 PPG) to go with the hardware (2 cups, 2 Harts, 5 Art Ross) Bucyk: Insane longevity, 2nd most games played, most goals, second most points. O'Reilly: Bruins leader in PIMs, quintessential Bruin. Schmidt: 4 Cups (2 as player, 2 as GM). Also won his only Hart and Scoring champ trophies 11 years apart ('51 and '40). Still kicking at 97! Bergeron: 3 Selke trophies, still active (not sure if I could watch the upcoming season if we lost him too).   Think I would go with Espo as my 4th personally."
BostonBruins,3dhqjo,sudonim87,-2,Thu Jul 16 14:37:34 2015 UTC,Chara is easily in the best of the rest tier and should be regarded in bruins history above bergeron with breathing room. imo of course

BostonBruins,3dfeor,ijcm,8,Wed Jul 15 21:08:39 2015 UTC,So this means he's at least gonna get a look in the NHL.  He won't be playing in the AHL this season because he's coming from the CHL.

BostonBruins,3dfeor,kylestephens54,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:25:05 2015 UTC,"Wow, good for him.  So does this mean we can't send him back to juniors now, or does that not matter with this contract?  Also, any details on the contract?  Assuming since it's ELC that it's 3 years at like 600k AAV, but I couldn't find anything on this."
BostonBruins,3dh5h5,Abhinn_Malhotra,8,Thu Jul 16 06:04:08 2015 UTC,I think Krejci and Kelly will be it again. Id be fine with Seids or Marchy getting it but probably Kelly.
BostonBruins,3dh5h5,ijcm,3,Thu Jul 16 07:58:49 2015 UTC,"Marchand is almost always on bergeron's line, so IMO it's better to have your captains / A. Captains broken up so there's 1 on the ice as often as possible. Also I think that his reputation across the league would work against him."
BostonBruins,3dh5h5,SpywareAgen7,7,Thu Jul 16 14:50:56 2015 UTC,"I'd like to see the C being passed to Bergeron already, but that won't obviously happen."
BostonBruins,3dh5h5,Zetch88,2,Thu Jul 16 12:45:26 2015 UTC,Could happen at the deadline if they are out of it and dump Chara.
BostonBruins,3dh5h5,j2thek47,-7,Thu Jul 16 13:43:12 2015 UTC,"Should of dumped chara around the draft. He's old, and sucks now. He's injured half his time he plays, but now you can't even tell when that is, because he plays like that all of the time.  Dump Chara while he is still worth something, and give the C to Bergy, who's fought hard and earned it after the past however many years."
BostonBruins,3dh5h5,brokentaters,9,Thu Jul 16 14:31:23 2015 UTC,"Yall are giving up on Chara way too quickly. Yeah he's old, but he is a freak athlete. And considering this is one of the longest offseasons he's had as a bruin, you have to expect he'll come back in great shape for this season."
BostonBruins,3dh5h5,Frisbockey,2,Thu Jul 16 15:12:35 2015 UTC,"Believe me, I hope like hell you're right."
BostonBruins,3dh5h5,brokentaters,3,Thu Jul 16 19:10:01 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be surprised if they tried.  Problem is that he was injured on and off all season last year and looked awful when he played because he was still injured when he did.  Therefore, no one is going to take him on with that massive contract with years still attached.  His contract and play is not attractive.  If he can come back and play well, then you might be able to move him.  But not at where the situation stands right now."
BostonBruins,3dh5h5,j2thek47,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:58:15 2015 UTC,"I think they did try.  There was a short period where it sounded like we might be sending him to Colorado for Ryan O'Reilly.  Maybe we should've, maybe that would've prevented O'Reilly's recent DUI.  LOL."
BostonBruins,3dh5h5,SuburbanHell,-1,Thu Jul 16 17:33:56 2015 UTC,Impossibly stupid opinions like this are why people shit on boston fans all the time.
BostonBruins,3dh5h5,bruins4777,5,Fri Jul 17 01:46:20 2015 UTC,"I hope its Krejci, but Claude loves his fribble crew too much so it'll be Kelly. I wouldn't mind if they gave it to Marchand just to piss off r/hockey."

And as far as Bergeron transitioning to Captain, it really makes no sense. From a fan perspective it's cool, but would it really make any difference on the ice or in the room? If anything I think it could make things worse. Look at the Sharks and Thornton and look at Modano when he got his C taken away, only made things worse."

BostonBruins,3dg2jb,devinsba,2,Thu Jul 16 00:10:26 2015 UTC,He was golden at Denver this year. He isn't necessarily a surprise
BostonBruins,3dg2jb,TuxYouUp,9,Thu Jul 16 01:51:46 2015 UTC,"Uh for a fourth rounder? I'd say he is.   If that draft was done over, he would go significantly higher."

BostonBruins,3ddyyq,NUKEFreeman,2,Wed Jul 15 16:58:43 2015 UTC,Just like Franson.
BostonBruins,3ddyyq,TuukkaNotTuukka,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:14:02 2015 UTC,"Except he isn't old, but I agree he is being overrated.  Everyone on the market has been overrated.  Like Oduya, being overrated on the market does not mean he wouldn't improve this team.  I just like Franson more because of his age and handedness."
BostonBruins,3ddyyq,NUKEFreeman,0,Wed Jul 15 20:19:55 2015 UTC,Throw in the fact that he'll be working his ass off in Dallas. Defense? I don't think any of their forwards know how to spell it.
BostonBruins,3ddyyq,GaryRogers,0,Thu Jul 16 01:38:58 2015 UTC,We had one of the best records from dec 31 onwards. But no you're right we just score goals and stuff.
BostonBruins,3ddyyq,ItsReallyOregano,10,Thu Jul 16 02:21:37 2015 UTC,I don't want Franson. He simply isn't very good.  I can't understand why so many Bruins fans are obsessed with him
BostonBruins,3ddyyq,Thecardinal74,3,Wed Jul 15 15:22:20 2015 UTC,We don't have any other choice now.  Oduya was the best out there and we had more than enough money to offer him and it appears we didn't even make a move.  So who else should we get?
BostonBruins,3ddyyq,Pnooms,2,Wed Jul 15 16:20:37 2015 UTC,Ehrhoff.
BostonBruins,3ddyyq,digifxplus,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:37:17 2015 UTC,"Hmmm, well that's a thought.  A little old but I would rather him than Franson."

BostonBruins,3ddyyq,digifxplus,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:44:00 2015 UTC,Much more preferable.  All we need is a temporary replacement D while we make more moves.
BostonBruins,3ddyyq,Pnooms,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:45:03 2015 UTC,"Boyle from the Rangers. They will be pressing the cap hard with a stepan deal.  We aren't getting a top 4 defenseman this year. Not without dismantling the team. Dougie fucked us.  We just need a placeholder for a year or two until Sweeney figures it out, and Boyle could do that"
BostonBruins,3ddyyq,Thecardinal74,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:21:25 2015 UTC,"How about no one? We already have about 8 NHL defenseman, so we really don't need another crap one. Franson isn't a top four guy."
BostonBruins,3ddyyq,icethepartyplanner,5,Wed Jul 15 16:28:49 2015 UTC,"Oh yea, Trotman and Miller are top notch.....and Miller's injured so here comes this Irwin guy.....  No, no one is unacceptable.  For Sweeny, it's get a replacement (and a good) defender to make up for the Hamilton fuck up. We have plenty of money, plenty of pieces, he needs to make something happen.  And after his comments about ""Hamilton+Lucic+Smith=41 goals, so Belesky+Hayes=41 goals makes it an even trade"" he really needs to redeem himself."
BostonBruins,3ddyyq,Pnooms,5,Wed Jul 15 16:36:17 2015 UTC,Hamilton was not a fuck up. He didnt want to play for this team at all. You cant force the guy to stay here. He got what he could for him and thats it
BostonBruins,3ddyyq,Lopezc2c,3,Wed Jul 15 16:40:15 2015 UTC,"I don't care that he didn't want to play for the team.  I care that Sweeny only told about 7-8 teams he was available for trade, got about 4 offers, and didn't even take the best one.  That's is not how a good GM operates."
BostonBruins,3ddyyq,Pnooms,6,Wed Jul 15 16:43:43 2015 UTC,A report from one person that has been repeatedly denied.

BostonBruins,3ddyyq,rowsdower726,2,Wed Jul 15 21:35:55 2015 UTC,"Many reputable journalists? I saw Chris Nichols tweet that Friedman said ""I think there were only 7 or 8 teams that knew"" and a bunch of people quote him. So that's a third-hand ""I think this happened"". What have you seen that I haven't?"
BostonBruins,3ddyyq,Easy75,-1,Wed Jul 15 21:59:30 2015 UTC,"Here's a source from Edmonton Journal quoting Friedman on a radio show: http://blogs.edmontonjournal.com/2015/07/11/boston-bruins-felt-that-edmonton-oilers-gm-peter-chiarelli-had-them-under-the-gun-in-dougie-hamilton-negotiations-friedman-says/  There have been plenty of other mentions of it, but I'm on mobile right now.  I'd still like to see where someone has denied or disputed that report."
BostonBruins,3ddyyq,rowsdower726,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:08:40 2015 UTC,"He was an RFA, so technically we could have forced him to stay here.  Especially given all of the other moves we made after that point which freed up cap room, we could have matched a lot of offers he would have gotten if he got offer sheeted."
BostonBruins,3ddyyq,ilessthan3math,2,Wed Jul 15 17:05:59 2015 UTC,It seems that sweeneys off season plan for free agents is to get people who want to play for the team and be proud to be a bruin. If he didnt want to be a bruin i dont think sweeney would have wanted to match any offer sheets.
BostonBruins,3ddyyq,Lopezc2c,0,Wed Jul 15 17:16:09 2015 UTC,"I never said our guys were good, but I don't think Franson is significantly better than any of the 4 guys vying for two spots. Try and use the space to trade for someone, because we need an upgrade. Franson isn't an upgrade to me though"
BostonBruins,3ddyyq,icethepartyplanner,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:45:47 2015 UTC,"Agreed, it would not be an upgrade, but a temporary place holder while we still make moves.  Someone mentioned Erhoff and I don't think that would be a bad idea at all.  He's a little older, but sign him to a 1 or 2 year deal and put him on the 3rd D-Line and we're good."
BostonBruins,3ddyyq,Pnooms,3,Wed Jul 15 16:49:51 2015 UTC,Isn't the third pairing what we have Miller and Trotman and Morrow and Irwin for though? Why do we need another name in that mix?

BostonBruins,3ddyyq,Bergy_37,6,Wed Jul 15 15:31:44 2015 UTC,I would rather one year with a gaping hole on defense while we either try to trade for someone or let our prospects develop than to sign Franson for 4 or whatever years and be stuck with him.
BostonBruins,3ddyyq,Lloyd--Christmas,4,Wed Jul 15 15:34:47 2015 UTC,Yeah but just because he's the only one left doesn't mean we should just go and get him just for the sake of getting somebody.
BostonBruins,3ddyyq,Handbone1469,2,Wed Jul 15 15:39:55 2015 UTC,"I do agree with that. If we get him for cheap on a short deal, I say go for it. If he wants money and long term, we need to stay away."
BostonBruins,3ddyyq,Bergy_37,3,Wed Jul 15 15:40:46 2015 UTC,"Oduya at under 4 mil? How the fuck do you miss that? Franson  is way more versatile, if they lock him up for less than oduya got all is forgiven."
BostonBruins,3ddyyq,_HagbardCeline,4,Wed Jul 15 20:10:47 2015 UTC,"Honestly boys, I'm not upset. Let's just relish in the fact that he spurned Buffalo, who undoubtedly offered him more money and a longer deal."

BostonBruins,3ddyyq,sixtensodapants17,3,Wed Jul 15 15:11:37 2015 UTC,I can see Franson going for close to what Oduya got

BostonBruins,3ddyyq,Pnooms,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:13:45 2015 UTC,"Hey I'm hoping for less! Hah, I just figured he'd get more because he's younger and can play top 4"
BostonBruins,3ddyyq,wickedhahhd,2,Wed Jul 15 15:18:54 2015 UTC,He will definitely get less.  Not even close.
BostonBruins,3ddyyq,KissTheRings617,2,Wed Jul 15 16:21:29 2015 UTC,Thank God we didn't get him
BostonBruins,3ddyyq,GaryRogers,2,Wed Jul 15 17:52:12 2015 UTC,"This is a little confusing and actually pretty damn disappointing to me. I get that Irwin is a good deal, has some upside and is still young....but Oduya at 3.75 M for 2 years????? THAT is a steal, to me, as others have mentioned, it is clear that the Irwin deal eliminated a chance for another L handed D man and possibly even another NHL D man period, unless the move another roster d man (seids is the only one who would make sense if they were determined to do so) This looks bad to me, Oduya is an upgrade over Seids for even money, never mind getting a little cap freed up in the process. Heck, if it were me I would have kept both, and tried to play a shit ton of L handed D men.. A Oduya-seids, chara-krug, Irwin/Morrow-Quaider d group is at least an improvement (post douie)"
BostonBruins,3ddyyq,sixtensodapants17,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:45:41 2015 UTC,Chara/Krug.... talk about Mutt & Jeff.   I'd like to see how that'd work actually. I think Krug's got more upside than people give him credit for.
BostonBruins,3ddyyq,ISeeMeNaked,2,Thu Jul 16 01:40:45 2015 UTC,I still can't comprehend this blind infatuation with Franson. He was a 5th 6th defensemen  on a horrible team in Toronto. It's crazy this pylon is not some great player that the Bs need.
BostonBruins,3ddyyq,sixtensodapants17,2,Wed Jul 15 15:41:42 2015 UTC,"What are you talking about? He was top 2 in Toronto. He got shifted down in the lineup in Nashville because, ya know, Nashville has the best D in the league.  Franson is the best D FA, and fills a need. No one is hoping he comes in and wins the Norris. He's coming in to bulk our D, which fucking sucks."
BostonBruins,3ddyyq,Pnooms,-4,Thu Jul 16 21:31:02 2015 UTC,Top 2 in Toronto is like AHL caliber on a real team also Mr hockey knowledge Nashville defense is not that good.
BostonBruins,3ddyyq,throck_star,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:49:39 2015 UTC,I know that I wanted Oduya more than anyone else.  There is no other option now in FA so we NEED to sign Franson to a 2 year deal or something.   The fact that we have about 5mil in cap space now and didn't sign Oduya is baffling.
BostonBruins,3ddyyq,Pnooms,3,Wed Jul 15 16:22:39 2015 UTC,"Oduya declined 5 a year from Buffalo so it clearly wasnt a question of money, he wanted a team where he liked his role and his cup chances. I also wouldnt agree that we need to sign anyone. The team can be bad for a season and the world will keep spinning. Locking up Franson for 3 or 4 years would be worse than 1 season where our D struggles but the young guys get the experience it needs"
BostonBruins,3ddyyq,throck_star,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:35:38 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying we need Franson for 4 years.  I was hoping we could get Oduya for 2 years and Franson should be about the same length, just to fill a spot.  We need to keep being championship contenders while all our pieces are still there.

The only player who I forsee having a serious downturn by the time we start the 2017 season would be Chara, the rest of our core will still be in their prime."
BostonBruins,3dewqu,Ajrob2128,13,Wed Jul 15 19:01:43 2015 UTC,"It's still about improvement for both of them. For each, 50+ points can be considered a realistic goal and successful season. They both paced that last season without major minutes, so sustaining that production in heavier, tougher minutes would be something to build off of. Either putting up 60+ points can be considered a huge victory. Under that 50-pleateau would be a lateral step and, for this phase of their development, a lateral move is a step in the wrong direction.   For Spooner specifically, he needs to work towards improving in the defensive end so he can gain the confidence of the coaching staff as a 2-way forward and not just an offensive talent."
BostonBruins,3dewqu,silax1,3,Wed Jul 15 19:21:48 2015 UTC,"I agree, but I think Claude has to do his part with their development too. Yes, they won't be the best defensively, but that's OK. As long as he plays them regular minutes and gives them opportunities they should both have really good years."
BostonBruins,3dewqu,icethepartyplanner,2,Wed Jul 15 19:37:05 2015 UTC,Wouldn't surprise me of they make up the 3rd line with (security blanket) Kelly.   If Loui is relegated to the 3rd again I'm going to blow a gasket.

BostonBruins,3dewqu,JohnnyRussell,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:49:30 2015 UTC,I think this year pastrnak will get 50ish..will be close to 70ish in his prime though. Spooner I think 40 pts would be a reasonable ceiling (of course he COULD Do better)
BostonBruins,3dewqu,fightingirishjd8,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:15:15 2015 UTC,i think if pastrnak continues to develop he could definitely have his best season be around a ppg. but yeah definitely not next season.
BostonBruins,3dewqu,nachoman456,6,Thu Jul 16 18:14:01 2015 UTC,pasta's skills are ridiculous. I could easily see him netting over 20 goals.
BostonBruins,3dewqu,TuxYouUp,3,Wed Jul 15 20:41:24 2015 UTC,Those mitts are so sick they were treated for Ebola.
BostonBruins,3dewqu,GaryRogers,3,Thu Jul 16 01:45:01 2015 UTC,"I hope to see Pasta put up over 50 points, and Spooner in the 40-60 range.  They are very doable targets, especially with the supporting cast that we will have."
BostonBruins,3dewqu,aaronweber29,3,Wed Jul 15 19:23:33 2015 UTC,SO MANY GOALS.
BostonBruins,3dewqu,ThunderRoad5,2,Wed Jul 15 19:27:28 2015 UTC,Pastrnak really impressed me last season. It is really  fun to watch this kid playing. He will bring a fresh wind into the team...
BostonBruins,3dewqu,wrzlbrmpf,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:15:42 2015 UTC,I would love to see both pass 20goals at least :)
BostonBruins,3dewqu,jmbelczy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:04:07 2015 UTC,It depends on what line they play on. I expect 40-60 points. I realize that's a wide area but without knowing injuries or line pairings or what have you it's hard to be precise.
BostonBruins,3dewqu,StraightDegan,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:59:28 2015 UTC,"It's fair to expect improvement from the youngsters, but I wouldn't get too unreasonable. The sophomore slump is real (think SJ's Hertl, he was hit really hard by it) so I am keeping my feet on the ground. As long as they get through the season without injuries and with decent amount of points and +/- statistic, I'd be satisfied."
BostonBruins,3dewqu,CynicalCzech,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:11:20 2015 UTC,"I mean, if Spooner is on the third line he won't see as much ice time so i'd say, 40-50 points would be the ceiling for his season.  Pasta will probably be on our 1a or 1b line so i'd say unless the dreaded sophomore slump hit him he could score 25ish goals and 30-40 assists."
BostonBruins,3dewqu,Germanhammer05,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:33:12 2015 UTC,"I would love Spooner and Pastrnak to play together on the third line. Continue to improve and learn the NHL game. This year teams will have film and be able to really plan for these two guys, especially with an offseason to go over tape and what not."
BostonBruins,3dewqu,PezDOY,2,Thu Jul 16 13:10:21 2015 UTC,I want Pasta on top 2 lines preferably with krecji
BostonBruins,3dewqu,sixtensodapants17,-4,Thu Jul 16 13:29:20 2015 UTC,They will be lucky to get 60 pts total between the both of them. You hockey fans know last year's leading scorer Jamie benn has 87 pts. Scoring is going down again and superstars Spoons and pasta are not scoring 60 pts. Maybe when we sign norris trophy winner Cody Franson he will score 35 goals and have 100 pts.
BostonBruins,3dehgd,Ajrob2128,15,Wed Jul 15 17:16:35 2015 UTC,"If that is the case, they should have let Adam McQuaid walk."
BostonBruins,3dehgd,rowsdower726,4,Wed Jul 15 17:21:01 2015 UTC,too important of a bottom pairing d to their identity.
BostonBruins,3dehgd,rowsdower726,6,Wed Jul 15 17:26:46 2015 UTC,which i think is bs btw
BostonBruins,3dehgd,Lopezc2c,2,Wed Jul 15 17:26:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I understand their thinking, but it just doesn't make sense.  You have a lot of young kids that you need to develop? Why overpay someone to stay on the roster to take up a spot that should be going to one of them?"
BostonBruins,3dehgd,rowsdower726,2,Wed Jul 15 17:29:24 2015 UTC,Because he hs the heart of a bruin and that is what sweeney is looking to do. He needs players that bleed black and gold and sweeney feels that mcquaid is one of thsose guys. They are trying ti get their identity back because what we saw last year was a team with no identity.
BostonBruins,3dehgd,Lopezc2c,6,Wed Jul 15 17:46:17 2015 UTC,"Kevan Miller does all of those things for a third of the price.   And I'm only interested in players who can do that and do something useful, like score goals, play good defense, kill penalties."
BostonBruins,3dehgd,rowsdower726,3,Wed Jul 15 17:48:41 2015 UTC,Well kevan miller comes at a third of the price because he cant do all of those things..players who have the skillset to excel at every aspect of the game only come at high prices
BostonBruins,3dehgd,crazy_canucklehead,2,Wed Jul 15 18:10:01 2015 UTC,"And Adam McQuaid is someone who ""excels"" at anything besides sticking up for his teammates?"
BostonBruins,3dehgd,rowsdower726,7,Wed Jul 15 18:12:35 2015 UTC,"Falling down.   Getting injured.   Guys multi talented! (Also a good third pairing guy, but not a top 4. I do actually like him as a third pairing guy.)"
BostonBruins,3dehgd,Lopezc2c,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:43:28 2015 UTC,"Yes, I do too! But it's too much for a bottom pairing guy with no offensive upside (like Krug)."
BostonBruins,3dehgd,rowsdower726,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:47:05 2015 UTC,"No i never said that. Im saying that mcquaids contract is not for him to score goals its for him to be a leader and be a big bad bruin. You may only be interested in the great players that can do everything but, if those players lack leadership and hear to be a bruin t then what are you left with? A team with no identity and you get nowhere like last year. All im saying is maybe his stats dont show much but his ability to lead may be just as good."
BostonBruins,3dehgd,MetalStoofs,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:29:03 2015 UTC,"Tell me what Adam McQuaid does that Miller doesn't.  Stay-at-home defenseman, fights, zero footspeed.  McQuaid's a leader? Does that justify 2 million more?   Kelly's a leader too, and he makes too much."
BostonBruins,3dehgd,Handbone1469,7,Wed Jul 15 18:44:59 2015 UTC,"I'm actually pretty okay with not signing a defenseman. Does it make it harder to reach for a playoff spot? Yes. But it gives us around $4.8M to work with to re-sign players like Krug(Contract year I think?), Loui and Marchand next year, Kelly comes off the books (or at least gets cheaper whatever happens), and we can make a better move then. It'll also give young guys a chance to earn a roster spot/develop into more than prospects."
BostonBruins,3dehgd,PezDOY,5,Wed Jul 15 18:17:27 2015 UTC,"What a crazy idea, developing our young talent. That never works, right Tampa?"
BostonBruins,3dehgd,Laockey35,3,Wed Jul 15 18:45:16 2015 UTC,Neely said he wants to be making trades that add and no longer subtract from the team because of their shit cap space last year.
BostonBruins,3dehgd,TuxYouUp,2,Wed Jul 15 17:17:56 2015 UTC,I hope Colin Miller pans out. I think the kid is going to be a monster.

BostonBruins,3dehgd,cubeofsoup,2,Thu Jul 16 15:35:06 2015 UTC,"Dougie's leaving fucked the Bruins. They were not expecting that.  That said, nobody is expecting the Bruins to be a Cup contender this year. Playoffs? Yes. Cup? Not likely.  That said the team they have now can probably make the playoffs.  They can pick their spot for getting the next Dougie, be it before the season a la Isles, during the season, trade deadline, or next offseason.  The goal is to contend for another cup within the next couple years. By then maybe one of our kids will be ready to take over for Chara. If not the B's have the flexibility to wait for the right person to come along"
BostonBruins,3dehgd,Germanhammer05,3,Wed Jul 15 20:12:54 2015 UTC,"I hope we don't sign anyone else at this point. Its time to lose the ""win now, fuck the future"" additude we have. We are currently set to look pretty damn good in a season or two so if we can maintain course ik happy."
BostonBruins,3ddxow,benjarmb,4,Wed Jul 15 14:52:07 2015 UTC,"This is a little confusing and actually pretty damn disappointing to me. I get that Irwin is a good deal, has some upside and is still young....but Oduya at 3.75 M for 2 years????? THAT is a steal, to me, as others have mentioned, it is clear that the Irwin deal eliminated a chance for another L handed D man and possibly even another NHL D man period, unless the move another roster d man (seids is the only one who would make sense if they were determined to do so)  This looks bad to me, Oduya is an upgrade over Seids for even money, never mind getting a little cap freed up in the process. Heck, if it were me I would have kept both, and tried to play a shit ton of L handed D men.. A Oduya-seids, chara-krug, Irwin/Morrow-Quaider d group is at least an improvement (post douie)"

BostonBruins,3ddxow,rowsdower726,0,Wed Jul 15 15:01:11 2015 UTC,Hopefully that encourages Sweeney trade for a top 4 guy instead.
BostonBruins,3deouo,SuburbanHell,2,Wed Jul 15 18:07:33 2015 UTC,If a team can sign franson at ~4 million then thats a pretty solid pickup. RHD top 4 defenseman who runs the powerplay.
BostonBruins,3deouo,MacerV,2,Wed Jul 15 18:09:31 2015 UTC,"Yep, and given the way Free Agency has gone (especially in light of the Oduya signing), I'd say it's very possible to get him for exactly that."
BostonBruins,3deouo,NUKEFreeman,2,Wed Jul 15 18:10:57 2015 UTC,"I think both will likely sign one-year deals.  Ehrhoff needs to prove he can stay healthy and productive after his concussion issue last season, and Franson need to prove he can continue to be a solid top 4 defensemen after a bad half season where he was buried on Nashville's depth chart.  With that said, I still want them to get Franson.  He would be a great pickup."
BostonBruins,3deouo,Ajrob2128,2,Wed Jul 15 18:23:06 2015 UTC,"I'd kill for Franson, or we have to trade for a RHD.  I'd hope for longer than a 1-year deal, but you're right he probably does have to prove it was a fluke, struggling in Nashville."
BostonBruins,3deouo,Change4Betta,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:25:23 2015 UTC,"ehrhoff will only get 1 year. thats what he does now, his agent is on record saying they want a 1 year deal to see how his new situation goes, and if its well they will talk an extension."

BostonBruins,3daius,CoOlBeAnSs,27,Tue Jul 14 19:45:05 2015 UTC,"I seem to be in the minority, but I want nothing to do with him and the contract he is going to get.  He'll be 34 when the season starts and we don't need another aging defenseman.  If we can get him for one or two years, okay fine.  I expect him to get a longer deal."
BostonBruins,3daius,NUKEFreeman,14,Tue Jul 14 19:48:43 2015 UTC,"I second this, I want him on the team, but only as a short-term solution.  If we're going longer-term we have to go younger, Franson is 27, for example.  Edit:  I should add, the reason I want him on the team, is he averaged 28 minutes a night during the playoffs.  That kind of ice time could provide great lengths in keeping Chara healthy this year if he eat those kinds of minutes during the season."
BostonBruins,3daius,SuburbanHell,8,Tue Jul 14 19:49:52 2015 UTC,"Exactly the guy I want.  Plus, he's a RHD.  Oduya is LHD, and we have plenty of them."
BostonBruins,3daius,NUKEFreeman,7,Tue Jul 14 19:51:34 2015 UTC,"Yep.  Franson is first on my list for that very reason, we need an RHD that can perform in the top pairing more than anything right now."
BostonBruins,3daius,SuburbanHell,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:56:37 2015 UTC,What are the actual chances of Boston actually landing a player in his prime and paying top dollar (unless Sweeny can sign another great deal)?

BostonBruins,3daius,TuxYouUp,3,Tue Jul 14 20:38:28 2015 UTC,"You're right, I do mean seids from 3 years ago. It's just that anytime anyone mentions seids on this sub everyone jumps at him having a rebound year so I was choosing my words carefully. I would be for oduya if it was to replace seidenberg."
BostonBruins,3daius,drbigfoot29,0,Tue Jul 14 20:42:17 2015 UTC,"His rebound years are gone, these guys are living in a fantasy world."
BostonBruins,3daius,xBlackLogic,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:51:59 2015 UTC,We don't have a healthy Seidenberg any more. That ACL/MCL is a life changing injury. I'd put Oduya ahead of Seids for that reason.   I do think they're really close though.
BostonBruins,3daius,GaryRogers,2,Tue Jul 14 22:54:18 2015 UTC,I dont want us signing any D man for more than 2 or 3 years. Way too many prospects who are on the cusp

BostonBruins,3daius,Sixchr,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:12:18 2015 UTC,"Here's my concerns when it comes to Oduya, obviously the big one is I think he's going to be overvalued based on his time in Chicago. He's a 33(34) year old defenseman so I'm saying no to too many years and too high of an aav.  The bigger thing that's not being acknowledged is the evaluation of him is skewed. Yes, he was very good in the playoffs again last year but he did not have a good regular season. He struggled badly and it feels like I was constantly reading Blackhawks fans' frustrations over it this year.   I'm not convinced that he's a better option than what's currently available (Franson). If he's cheap and on short term then fine I guess, but I don't think that's likely. The time for Johnny Oduya to be a Bruin was the deadline in 2012, not free agency in 2015."

I definitely like the Violin in the Behind the B intro - good call man   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE4_CYFUDM4 American Horror Story -  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDOSLA0if0U Behind the B
BostonBruins,3dcjtf,JAMIETHUMB,2,Wed Jul 15 14:45:26 2015 UTC,There was Beverly Hills by Weezer
BostonBruins,3dcjtf,darknod,2,Wed Jul 15 13:46:35 2015 UTC,"Do they still play ""Seek and Destroy"" by Metallica whenever there's a fight?"
BostonBruins,3dcjtf,jczik,2,Wed Jul 15 14:44:32 2015 UTC,"I was tinkering around with mine a few nights ago (had to take out Cali Swag District's magnum opus), so I'd confirm that everyone's list is pretty good.    Boston's Peace of Mind is great for belting out and being reminded of Boston.  The Police's Roxanne is fun to sing if you replace ""Roxanne"" with ""Marchand"" and leave that red light on.  Everyone rips on Fall Out Boy, but I like Light 'Em Up because it got played so often that I associate it with the 2013 run."
BostonBruins,3dcjtf,zipperoooo,2,Wed Jul 15 14:47:58 2015 UTC,Fallout Boy is kinda defining hockey music for me these days. Not a bad thing at all.
BostonBruins,3dcjtf,GaryRogers,2,Thu Jul 16 01:47:31 2015 UTC,My favorite at the games before I moved away. 'The Game' by Motorhead.
BostonBruins,3dcjtf,IpecacNeat,2,Wed Jul 15 18:14:34 2015 UTC,"Black Betty hasn't been mentioned yet, used to get a good bit of play at the Gahden."
BostonBruins,3dcjtf,Easy75,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:42:04 2015 UTC,DKM's The Boys Are Back is the crew's season opener song.  Time to Go is always good.  Johnny I Hardly Knew Ya is expressly reserved for playoff games
BostonBruins,3dae5i,daa5250,19,Tue Jul 14 19:13:22 2015 UTC,"If he can clean up his game, great.  I'm not holding my breath on that."
BostonBruins,3dae5i,NUKEFreeman,2,Tue Jul 14 19:45:22 2015 UTC,Before last year he was actually a fairly clean player.  He just hits a lot.
BostonBruins,3dae5i,PhillyT,17,Wed Jul 15 05:35:08 2015 UTC,As soon as he tunes up a couple Habs we'll be loving him. Hope he can keep it clean though.
BostonBruins,3dae5i,Nothingiswrongwithme,9,Tue Jul 14 21:25:49 2015 UTC,"Don Sweeney on WAAF today: ""The first conversation I had with Rinaldo was he has to become a penalty killer in this league, he skates extremely well and can get down ice and create anxiety, and certainly look to be physical, but you can't be suspended and you can't be not reliable on both sides of the puck"".  About 10:10 http://media.waaf.com/a/107388635/boston-bruins-gm-don-sweeney-7-14-15.htm"
BostonBruins,3dae5i,Easy75,11,Tue Jul 14 19:43:35 2015 UTC,"I read that in the other post about his WAAF interview as well.  From that quote and watching this video (I know it's highlights) Sweeney kind of has a point.  If this kid can get his crap together, he could be the wrecking ball that Lucic used to be.  Now, he'll never score a goal, but that's fine if he can make a few decent passes and just run rampant on the other team while staying out of the box.    I've always said that the Front Office were the ones that screwed up Lucic's game.   Should never have given him top line money and taken the fighting away from him."
BostonBruins,3dae5i,Knobdy1,5,Tue Jul 14 19:47:38 2015 UTC,"The other problem Rinaldo has is he has a target on his back from the officials. If me/other Flyers fans had a dollar for every time Rinaldo got 2 minutes for ""Rinaldo'ing"" somebody we'd all have a lot of fucking dollars. He'd get countless penalties for doing nothing at all.  Granted, that is the precedent you set when you have multiple dirty hits in your career."
BostonBruins,3dae5i,Heatinmyharbl,2,Tue Jul 14 21:00:54 2015 UTC,"He'd get countless penalties for doing nothing at all.    Awww fuck, we already have McQuaid for that..."
BostonBruins,3dae5i,TheVargTrain,3,Wed Jul 15 02:17:40 2015 UTC,Yep. He can be a very effective 4th liner if he limits to goonish behavior to when Clode tells him to do it.
BostonBruins,3dae5i,JonnyBox,2,Tue Jul 14 20:59:43 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping he jumps at the opportunity to have an expanded role on a team (PK) and steps up. Not optimistic, but hopeful.  Campbell and Paille needed to go, but we did lose a solid PK tandem when they weren't re-signed. Granted 37, 63, 21, 23, 46, and 25 are all very capable PKers... it'd be nice to not have to rely on them all the time and save some of their legs."
BostonBruins,3dae5i,Easy75,7,Tue Jul 14 21:01:34 2015 UTC,"Fights Campbell, decks Boychuck, then annihilates Iginla.  All in Bruins outfits.  I guess it's better to have him fight than having Soupy fight last year. At least opposing players will think twice about it. We lost Lucic, but we definitely have more players that can intimidate this year than we did last year. So that's a plus."
BostonBruins,3dae5i,TuxYouUp,8,Tue Jul 14 20:48:09 2015 UTC,"I've said it other places, but Rinaldo is a mean motherfucker.   I don't think a player of his caliber is worth a 3rd round pick, and he has a propensity for trouble and ill-advised PIMs, but he's an angry, mouthy, agitating, tough, intimidating dude, and there's a use for that in the NHL - assuming that use is judicious, of course.   ""In a fight, anger is as good as courage."" -Welsh proverb"
BostonBruins,3dae5i,SnacksCCM,12,Tue Jul 14 20:53:02 2015 UTC,I'll tell you what isn't popular. That goddamn music track
BostonBruins,3dae5i,anirishguy13,4,Tue Jul 14 19:22:38 2015 UTC,"YOUUUUUUU MAAAAAAAAAAKE, MEEEEEEEE YOOUUUUUUU!!!!"
BostonBruins,3dae5i,Pnooms,2,Tue Jul 14 19:42:24 2015 UTC,I seriously feel like there needs to be a group of people dedicated to hunting down the people who put crappy music on highlight videos. It's a freaking plague.
BostonBruins,3dae5i,idosillythings,3,Wed Jul 15 03:27:40 2015 UTC,"He plays with intensity and will drop the gloves, which are two things we have been lacking. I don't like his dirty play, but love the intensity."
BostonBruins,3dae5i,bruinsfab,3,Tue Jul 14 21:16:03 2015 UTC,"I think he can do a decent job for us( ala Ferland for the flames in the playoff's), the real challenge is going to be keeping him out of the box."
BostonBruins,3dae5i,Mayo999,3,Tue Jul 14 21:34:45 2015 UTC,"I'm disappointed, that clip didn't show him hitting one Canadien"
BostonBruins,3dae5i,PainfulPeanutBlender,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:14:25 2015 UTC,He hit a shit ton of Bruins...
BostonBruins,3dae5i,FCOS,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:53:13 2015 UTC,"The one where he said ""Let's go Motherfuckers"" was when he fought Prust, but that doesn't technically count."
BostonBruins,3dae5i,bbplay_13,3,Wed Jul 15 22:22:29 2015 UTC,"I might be in the minority, but even though the league is moving away from the goon/enforcer types, there's still a need for them, people like Pasta will be targets next year and guys like Rinaldo will be the first to drop the gloves and defend their team mates."
BostonBruins,3dae5i,The_1_In_21-1,2,Wed Jul 15 08:57:38 2015 UTC,My only problem with that is it'll be hard for him to protect Pasta cause they won't be on the same line. That being said I can't wait for Rinaldo to fuck up some Habs
BostonBruins,3dae5i,JohnnyRussell,2,Wed Jul 15 15:22:56 2015 UTC,If he can be clean and keep the aggressive nature I'd be happy!
BostonBruins,3dae5i,LilCrittles,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:42:54 2015 UTC,What in his past makes you think that he could play this way?
BostonBruins,3dae5i,bostonbruins922,3,Wed Jul 15 12:14:36 2015 UTC,"Aggressive? The video I watched? I don't know if he's clean or dirty, I was just saying if he's clean I'd enjoy it"
BostonBruins,3dae5i,LilCrittles,3,Wed Jul 15 15:06:08 2015 UTC,I still hate this fucking guy
BostonBruins,3dae5i,S0ulBucket,0,Tue Jul 14 23:47:39 2015 UTC,"Lol, he's your problem now. Sorry guys."

BostonBruins,3dae5i,lion27,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:33:34 2015 UTC,"I mean, we'll atleast have something to cheer about while we lose this year. He may be a d-bag, but we're gonna have to accept him as our d-bag, like Marchand. Plus, any guy who can make the Bruins look like they're girl scouts single handedly isn't that horrible to have as long as he does it cleanly."
BostonBruins,3dae5i,Ted-Lindsays-Elbow,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:11:45 2015 UTC,Marchy is at least easier to accept as our D-Bag since he can score.

BostonBruins,3dae5i,CMarchy,-5,Wed Jul 15 07:02:57 2015 UTC,This piece of human garbage is the reason we didn't go further in 2014 with Iginla. He fucking jumped him and concussed him in that fight and Iginla was in and out of the lineup from that point on until the playoffs when he clearly wasn't the same guy.   Fuck Zac Rinaldo. This league doesn't need bums like this anymore. Half of those hits in that video were suspendable.
BostonBruins,3dae5i,loochbag17,7,Wed Jul 15 00:37:58 2015 UTC,"Rinaldo has his fair share of dirty plays but there was nothing wrong with that, he threw a legal hit and Iginla asked him to fight and Rinaldo just got the better jump on him."
BostonBruins,3dae5i,bbplay_13,2,Wed Jul 15 00:45:38 2015 UTC,"TBH I never thought he was dirty. Except for the Letang hit, that was fucking dirty. Nearly all his hits are legal, he's just so fucking small, fast, and strong that everything he does looks ruthless and is in deserve of a penalty."
