Gamesnews,3dyxwj,Torvusil,4,Mon Jul 20 17:46:23 2015 UTC,Is this a remake of the original or a sequel?
Gamesnews,3dyxwj,Sponge-worthy,2,Mon Jul 20 18:32:51 2015 UTC,"Seems to be a remaster, as there are new(?) things shown in the trailer that weren't in the original version."

Gamesnews,3dmeb6,gamesnewsbot,4,Fri Jul 17 13:21:23 2015 UTC,"They should extend ""Mercenary mode"" to PVE so that way you queue even in dungeons with everyone."
Gamesnews,3dmeb6,Lhumierre,4,Fri Jul 17 14:02:10 2015 UTC,Might as well do away with factions and races at that point.
Gamesnews,3dmeb6,Kanzentai,3,Fri Jul 17 17:16:26 2015 UTC,it seems like everything they been doing Post-WoTLK seems to remove conflict more and more.  Flying mounts absolutely destroyed world pvp or even seeing other people in the world at almost all levels.  They completely started to just say fuck it and let all races be all classes damn near so there goes lore as well.  What else is left?
Gamesnews,3dmeb6,Lhumierre,0,Fri Jul 17 20:02:29 2015 UTC,factions? yeah. races? no.
Gamesnews,3djdp6,gamesnewsbot,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:14:53 2015 UTC,I don't know what this is. Is it a empire-builder? Is it a turn-based strategy? Is it an RPG?
Gamesnews,3djdp6,UnholyTeemo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:53:55 2015 UTC,It's a 4x game set in a fantasy setting.
Gamesnews,3djc21,Torvusil,4,Thu Jul 16 19:03:11 2015 UTC,I might have cared if there wasn't over a dozen different Angry Birds already. Weird that we got a sequel to the Star Wars spinoff before the original series.

Gamesnews,3ddb9x,PalinFreeborn,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:12:07 2015 UTC,"I recently revisited this game and they've made some small tweaks that make stealth viable and ""going loud"" much more fun. I'm thoroughly enjoying myself with it, though I really think they should focus on putting in more heists instead.   Or, at least, give me something to do with my massive reserves of cash besides buy weapons, masks, and cover cleaner costs when murdering every civilian on a map."

I'm so glad they're not only releasing a new one, but that they understand the need for tongue-in-cheek humor with their normally bland gothic environments."

Gamesnews,3d6kam,thegooblop,2,Mon Jul 13 23:43:20 2015 UTC,I can't think of another developer that puts out sequels this fast. Love the dedication.

Gamesnews,3c79eb,yutt0,2,Sun Jul 5 15:18:26 2015 UTC,"I played the demo for Ronin the other day. I enjoyed a good portion of it, because it felt like someone was trying to recreate the kind of over-the-top swprd-slicing action of Kill Bill, but it honestly felt like a knock-off version of Gunpoint. In particular, I hated the ""cyber-ninjas"" that are immune to normal methods of killing.  Honestly, you're probably better off just picking up and playing Gunpoint.  Also, Yandere Simulator is growing on me. At first, I couldn't wrap my head around how creepy it was, but now it's starting to look like a weird, anime version of Hitman, so I think it might actually turn out pretty good."

Gamesnews,3c3zya,gamesnewsbot,3,Sat Jul 4 15:37:07 2015 UTC,"If you’re one of the 20 million(!) players who have the PC edition of Minecraft (referred to by techy people as the Java version)   Can I conclude from this that the new version will not require Java?  Edit: Hmm, from other sources it sounds like this is just the pocket edition on steroids? Meh, kinda lame. I thought this would be Minecraft 1.5 (a proper Minecraft)"
Gamesnews,3c3zya,Deathcrow,2,Sat Jul 4 16:06:50 2015 UTC,"That's what I take away from it, if this is true it might really improve performance all over the board. I'm going to be cautious tough,  Microsoft might just go and screw over  players to monetize, after al it probably took plenty of time and money to rebuild the game and giving it away free to owners of the java version won't make them much. Not to mention the inevitable forced integration with all those lovely new win10 systems whether it benefits the game or not.  The again, the java version ain't leaving so there is no worry there."
Gamesnews,3c3zya,Izithel,2,Sat Jul 4 16:25:22 2015 UTC,"afteral it probably took time and money to rebuild the game and giving it away free to owners of the java version won't make them much   Microsoft has been trying for a while to get their OS Store on PC off the ground, Minecraft could be the thing to do it. Also there's always more kids turning 10 who hear for the first time of Minecraft. It being available on the Windows Store will probably make it much simpler for casuals (read: Mom & Dad) to pick it up."
Gamesnews,3c3zya,Deathcrow,2,Sat Jul 4 16:30:26 2015 UTC,Seems like its more like the console versions or the Pocket Edition than it is like the PC version.

Gamesnews,3bw1s8,gamesnewsbot,2,Thu Jul 2 16:51:39 2015 UTC,"This was, perhaps, my favorite trailer from E3 this year. It was a new IP, gorgeous, not necessarily innovative but definitely trying to break the mold of E3 sequelitis, and it looked just really damn fun to play.  I have high hopes for it. I hope they can hold up the ""open, reclaimed world"" gameplay they showed."
Gamesnews,3btywj,Torvusil,3,Thu Jul 2 03:19:00 2015 UTC,So they took the money-making system of CS:GO and shoved it into TF2?  Honestly I'm slightly offended.   When is Valve going to actually release a game instead of just packaging up community made products and selling them for absurd profits?

Gamesnews,3biisg,gamesnewsbot,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:39:58 2015 UTC,So disappointing that this isn't coming to PC :/ Maybe if they had included bots and a single-player mode from the start (to help people learn this incredibly difficult game) then the player-base might not have died out within a matter of days.
