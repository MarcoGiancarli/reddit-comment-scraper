Since the older cameras don't have that lever, and there is no manual ring, that's why I think it would be open.  Now I'm curious how it works."

photography,3e2qwq,rogerhausman,4,Tue Jul 21 20:15:44 2015 UTC,"Kubrick's ""Barry Lyndon"".   A period piece, Kubrick wanted principal photography to employ as much natural light as possible. This meant indoor night scenes were shot by candlelight. Yes, candlelight. He used a super-fast Zeiss Planar 50mm f/0.7 lens to achieve this - the lowest f-stop in film history.   Technology aside, Kubrick built his sets and framed his shots to make every take appear pleasing and thoughtful, like a series of paintings rather than a series of frames.   I'll leave Ryan O'Neal's 1970's haircut out of this, because that's a discussion for another time.   But if you want to see how a master recreates the 18th century, watch ""Barry Lyndon""."

photography,3e2qwq,ordash,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:21:09 2015 UTC,"Film is a visual medium coming directly from photography. There is nothing vague about assuming that good films have something to do with great photography, it's just common sense."
photography,3e2qwq,rokkoralph,3,Tue Jul 21 17:04:13 2015 UTC,"Yes, but it is just the medium for the story telling. The story is also important. People who are not as visually oriented may gravitate towards the story itself rather than how it is realized visually. In recent memory, The Tree of Life was an absolutely gorgeous film by Terrence Malick that was not received very well."
photography,3e2qwq,ordash,2,Tue Jul 21 18:12:12 2015 UTC,"It is not ""just the medium"". The Medium is everything, otherwise it would't matter how a story is told, and there wouldn't be different media in the first place. ""Story"" is just a clumsy metapbor for how photographs and other visual media convey their specific experience. I know that most people just care about ""story"", ""character"" or dialogues in movies without ever noticing, what makes movies or photographs special. ""Tree of Life"" was not received well because the people can't understand pictures as good as they understand narratives made out of language and so every movie that dares to be visual first and foremost has difficulties at the box office. We all learn how to write and read early in school but nobody learns how to understand images there, so most assume that it is more or less the same. It isn't. And so it doesn't matter if anyone is ""visually oriented"" or not, it doesn't change the fact that film is a visual medium. A book doesnt care if you can read it or not, if you can't then you won't be able to understand it, there is no way around it. You can't just ignore the reading to get to the ""story"" in another way when confronted with a book, it doesn't make sense."

photography,3e2qwq,zak_on_reddit,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:29:09 2015 UTC,"Steve McQueen's three feature films (Hunger, Shame, and 12 Years a Slave) have beautiful photography throughout.  Yasujiro Ozu is the master of the static shot. Tokyo Story is the apex of his talents as a filmmaker.  Michael Haneke's The White Ribbon is a splendidly shot film. The White Ribbon is in black and white, and the camera is pretty static, in the spirit of Ozu.  Hiroshi Teshigahara has two very interesting films (Woman in the Dunes and The Face of Another) that I don't see too much discussion for. With this latter film, I will be writing about my general enthusiasm for its cinematography rather than its photography, which I believe is being treated as two seperate qualities in this post.  The Face of Another is quite bizarre. The first scene is a moving X-Ray of the protagonist's skull. I believe he is being photographed for surgery. Anyway, we the audience can hear him speak, and the skull's jaw and throat pantomine accordingly. Check it out here! I haven't seen this technique used anywhere else -- perhaps I don't see enough films to know, however.  There is another scene in which a strange framing is employed: the protagonist is photographed from behind and other oblique angles before his ""new face"" is revealed by the removal of bandages. Teshigahara's cinematographer also uses rack focuses and dollies to move about the space. It's a very interesting way of shooting a very talky scene between a doctor and his patient!  I believe that David Lynch might have creatively ""stolen"" something from this film for Blue Velvet. Within the aforementioned ""strange framing,"" a sculpture wall full of human ears lies ahead of the protagonist. A character later sits upon a chair that is shaped like a human ear. The human ear seems to be a touchstone within visual surrealism. While it is impossible to know if Lynch took inspiration from this film exactly, the stylistic similarities between Blue Velvet's ears and The Face of Another's ears delight me.  This other scene has a very memorable and unsettling zoom as well. There's really nothing quite like a well-timed zoom."

After going through Nat Hab you really see that the quality of guide really helps for getting close to the bears as they actually recognize the different guides.  If you don't want to go for a whole week you can definitely do a day trip via a floatplane from Kodiak Island. But please please please don't go through a company like K Bay Air based out of Homer that flies in wheel planes to the beach where the bears are (it's a really narrow beach littered with driftwood making the landing dangerous). One of the wheel plane pilots actually throttled up and taxied right into my group on the beach before we escaped up the beach.   You can try Kodiak Island for bear viewing but you're not going to get nearly as close as those bears have been hunted and know to run from people.  Oh yeah and for timing July was entertaining since it was mating season and there was the occasional males brawling. But if you're wanting the action shots with salmon you're going to want late August/ early September. Brooks Falls is amazing for the salmon run too.

photography,3e2f84,BigJAnder,4,Tue Jul 21 17:47:20 2015 UTC,Hello! I started to shoot portraits recently. Here's compilation of my first four shootings. I would love if someone could give me some directions. https://www.flickr.com/photos/stasvarych/sets/72157655859417971
photography,3e2f84,akastas,3,Tue Jul 21 13:05:25 2015 UTC,"Don't have any directions, but you have some really great shots here. I think the grain effect on some of the images (eg. https://www.flickr.com/photos/stasvarych/19495895390/in/album-72157655859417971/) doesn't produce very nice skin, especially on the face. I would have gone for something a bit softer."
photography,3e2f84,FallingFear,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:14:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Yep, I can totally see what you are talking about. I remember I thought about that while editing but didnt find a good solution at the time. Will try something new, thanks again."
photography,3e2f84,akastas,2,Tue Jul 21 13:21:56 2015 UTC,"The grain in this one looks like it's so obvious because of heavy cropping. Or maybe you shot too fast and had to up the iso, aperture seems to not be stopped down much. Maybe a hint of fill flash instead of upping the iso? Seems like there was ample light."
photography,3e2f84,throwaway42,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:41:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I just messed up in post. I thought big grain would look good but instead I got very unnatural grain for this kind of shot. That photo isnt even cropped."
photography,3e2f84,akastas,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:47:34 2015 UTC,"Haha, I never added grain on purpose; I hardly ever shoot in broad daylight, so usually I combat it. But yeah, if it's on purpose, it might work with smaller grain."
photography,3e2f84,throwaway42,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:52:10 2015 UTC,I like the grain gives the portraits a classic / nostalgic feel. Keep in mind these are pretty low res JPG so the JPG artifacts make it look worse. Grain is the type of high frequency detail that compression really fucks with.
photography,3e2f84,Jcwolfe00,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:43:38 2015 UTC,"Fair enough; it's all about personal preference. I hadn't considered compression as an issue, so you may well be right!"
photography,3e2f84,FallingFear,3,Tue Jul 21 16:23:09 2015 UTC,"Nice work, good lighting on most shots and decent post processing.  The biggest thing I'd suggest is to play around with your cropping; I think some of the images you posted would be better as 4x5 or even square.   The crop on this shot in particular feels awkward, and it looks like you cut off her hands.  If you kept the top of the frame where it is and cropped the bottom up to make it a 4x5, it would make a much stronger image."
photography,3e2f84,tim_lingley,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:21:58 2015 UTC,"Oh, you are right! Hmm, I do have some problems with cropping and I almost can't shoot horizontal portraits as well. I will pay attention to cropping, thanks!"
photography,3e2f84,akastas,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:27:50 2015 UTC,definitely agree with 4x5 crop suggestion. I find most of my images get cropped to 4x5 these days.
photography,3e2f84,Jcwolfe00,3,Tue Jul 21 15:44:32 2015 UTC,"I really like this one, it's pretty atypical for a portrait photo.  Where were these taken? Your models/fashion is beautiful and classy, by the way! I loved all these shots! :)"

I think my two fav are the girl on the bench with the rose - very classic, nice touch with the rose. And I really like the girl on the bench tucked behind the flowers. Putting the flowers in the foreground really helps add some depth. Other shots are great as well, those two just stood out to me personally.  Followed you."

I think you did a great job on all of them, but Spider 4 seemed like it wasn't... focused(?) enough?

photography,3e2f84,jsoltysik,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:20:17 2015 UTC,"Pretty good work!  A major point of critique I have, however, is that in quite a few of your pictures a large portion of the picture is lacking an interesting foreground or sky. Take this one for instance; the grass is just that, but it takes up half of the picture! Or this one in which the sky is really not all that interesting but again it's 50% of the image."
photography,3e2f84,napmeijer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:13:08 2015 UTC,"thanks for the feedback. i'd love to go back to nanpu bridge. i thought about cropping it but the wind that night was howling and there's a lot of blur from vibration. if you zoom in on the light trails, you can see they're sinusoidal.  i think i'm going to plan a trip to shanghai this year just to try to shoot that bridge again. it requires sneaking into one of the residences in a gated complex. hopefully the lock to the roof access is still busted open."
photography,3e2f84,jsoltysik,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:18:47 2015 UTC,I really like the vertical shot of the CCTV building. Really well composed.

photography,3e2f84,brazilliandanny,2,Tue Jul 21 16:00:34 2015 UTC,"I hope to expand my portfolio to concerts, mostly small metal shows, any tips you're willing to throw out in regards to equipment and settings? it would seem that shooting in manual would be too crazy and you would miss shots and it seems that shooting aperture wouldn't give you the control you needed."
photography,3e2f84,mrwatts,7,Tue Jul 21 16:12:55 2015 UTC,"I usually shoot manual, the thing with Metal is its fast. If you want to capture hair whips and head banging you need to shoot fast. So Ill shoot f2.8-f4 and have the speed around 125/200/250 with the ISO boosted pretty high to accommodate.  With the lighting constantly changing you will get over and under exposed images but thats why you shoot RAW and that's why you shoot a LOT of pics.   I usually shoot with a 5d, or a 7d and a pair of lenses.   24-105 f4  24-70 2.8   70-200 2.8   15mm fisheye  Tokina 11-16   50mm 1.4   Depending on what's available to me I usually have a zoom and a wide from that list."

I would have composed it a bit differently: tilt camera a bit up for less foreground grass, a few steps to the right to get the whole bycicle lot in the frame.    bunker and old-bunker > They are the same pic. Personally, I would've tried not to cut off the light switch, but I don't know if you cropped out anything and had to. And maybe shot from a bit lower to give the door more space.  come back > Focus missed, a bit blurry, left and bottom side are empty, but not in a good negative space way like the top right in bunker or the left side in life saver. I'd lose this one.    glowing leaves > I like the processing and the atmosphere, composition could have been a bit tighter. Here is a quick crop. Keep in mind I mostly shoot people, so maybe a landscape photog can give you better input.    hidden beauty > Cheesy postprocessing in my opinion. The muted leaves are ok, but the blossom has been pushed (brightened) too much to be believable.    homely > I like it, but felt that cropping it slightly would make it even more homely.    law > good colour contrast    life saver > Warm and vibrant, I like it. Try getting rid of some of the chroma noise. Getting the eyes in focus is a bitch, you almost had it.    mushroom > Try how it looks if you shoot from even lower. I like the colours / white balance though.    popcorn > Missed focus on the guy, it's on the woman behind him, and if the guy was the subject of the photo, the exposure is too dark for him. The tree takes up too much space, the rest of the background is cluttered / busy. I would lose this one.    purple > Missed focus, hazy.

If you want to spice it up, get the tree formation out of dead center.    walls > Looks/ feels like an old photograph. I like it. But with the sky so empty, you could've maybe showed more of the walls by tilting a bit lower.    In all, good results for only photographing for a month.

photography,3e2f84,akastas,2,Tue Jul 21 14:38:25 2015 UTC,Fractal flower is my favourite from this set. Have to say I don't like the processing on the dandelion (9105). WB too cold and oversaturated for my tastes. 6827 suffers a bit because we can't really see the insect and the dof is too shallow for the long stems in the flower.
photography,3e2f84,throwaway42,2,Tue Jul 21 15:37:15 2015 UTC,"Thank you!  The dandelion was taken with a P&S about 5 years ago and I may have gone a bit overboard with the processing.   Everything else (except the snowflakes) were taken with my recently acquired 100L macro. I am still learning the art and from this experience, learned to dial down the aperture to at least f8 or lower.  The first one though, was in a pretty good wind and I was holding the flower's stem steady in one hand and the camera in the other.  Thanks for your time!"
photography,3e2f84,diabetic_debate,2,Tue Jul 21 15:45:15 2015 UTC,"Which aperture you want to use depends on what you want to do. Some shots are better with a really shallow dof, and if you have a controlled setting with tripod, no wind, hardly any movement it's not to hard to hit focus. Both Bumble Bee and Fractal Flower have the focus spot on and the shallow dof works very well. And if you stop down to f/8 you'll ask yourself where the hell all your light went ;)"
photography,3e2f84,throwaway42,2,Tue Jul 21 15:53:04 2015 UTC,"ha ha, that's true. I just would have liked more of the bumblebee to be in focus. Although, thinking about it, the only way to get the bokeh AND have the complete bumblebee in focus would be to do focus stacking.   Still working on finding an insect to freeze to do that!"
photography,3e2f84,diabetic_debate,2,Tue Jul 21 15:55:12 2015 UTC,"Imo, as long as you catch the eyes, the rest isn't as important. Focus stacking would be much too tedious for me ;)"

photography,3e2f84,raysuhhh,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:50:50 2015 UTC,"Kinda awkward to view and navigate the mobile version on a laptop and I'm not sure how to swap it back.  That said, you'll notice you get better results at the start of the album with the cat being lit from the window than you do from the dog in the park.  That's because with the window light, the light is directional, whereas at the park you have a pretty dark, overcast day.  Overcast can be good but not so much when the clouds are dark.  So before you shoot, have a look at the light and see what it's doing.  Too dark and your images will look flat, too harsh and you'll have overblown highlights all over your shots."

Also, really good light for all the shots- especially the b&w bridge one and sunset.   My absolute favorite is Before the First Look- I love the emotion. I'd have to say my least favorite is the First Dance photo- it seems a little awkward, framing wise and the background is distracting to me."

I was going to attempt to create a imgur with only my photos, but most of them exceed file size limit. I don't like smugmug b/c you cannot view the images to the size they are intended (like my kata juta stitch), but I'm no longer using Flickr b/c fuck them.  So this is actually a combination of both mine and my wife's photos in one album. However, they are labeled as such, e.i. Mitch Watts is me. . . I think my wife has some pretty amazing photos, so pick one of hers too if it's the better photo. Also critiques and questions are welcome to any of the photos.  https://mitchwatts.smugmug.com/Australia/"
photography,3e2f84,mrwatts,2,Tue Jul 21 15:25:04 2015 UTC,I liked the ones near Great Ocean Road as well as the shots of Uluru best. This one was my favorite because I think it shows a side of Australia that foreigners never really picture (I tend to think of red sand and blue sky and forget there's so much more) : https://mitchwatts.smugmug.com/Australia/i-NRvpKZp/A  The shot of the Sydney Opera House Auditorium was also neat...I've seen so many pics of the outside but I don't think I've ever seen one of the interior.
photography,3e2f84,calethelia,2,Tue Jul 21 16:42:07 2015 UTC,"The auditorium shot was like 90% luck. 1. We technically weren't supposed to even shoot in there. 2. Our tour guide was awesome and let us shoot once the other group was gone. 3. That was a three shot stitch and I only took three photos, because that's all the time I had. I wouldn't have guessed that they turned out the way they did. Now that being said, my camera is pretty quiet, so I was constantly adjusting exposure every room we walked into so that I could grab quick shots if I saw something I wanted to get. Also articulating screen for the win for stealthy shots.  Great Ocean Road was some of my favorite shots I think because they forced me to create my own scene and it felt like a challenge instead of a ""walk up, point, shoot, next"". Now stack that with overcast and a limited time to get to our hostel. The only thing I had going for me was low-tide."

I chose the location and was happy to see that the weather forecast was was clouds/sunshine.  I didn't check the wind though and it turned out to be pretty blowy.  This did limit what we could do as we had to shelter behind one side of the building to stop my flash blowing over.  Still, despite the lack of variety I was happy with the results and so was he."

photography,3e2f84,Radiatron,2,Tue Jul 21 15:54:52 2015 UTC,"I like this one, but over all your shots need better exposure control. I get that sometimes overexposure is a stylistic choice, but in some of the photos it seems like less of a choice and more of automatic exposure getting the best of you. GradND filter either on lens or in post would have made that photo pop way more, and although there probably wasn't any sky data available (pure white rarely contains any) the trees in the upper left wouldn't have been as blown out.   Also, I would have loved to see this properly exposed and in portrait or portrait stitched.   I think you have a good eye for composition, now just modify your settings some or add ND for more control."
photography,3e2f84,mrwatts,3,Tue Jul 21 16:22:32 2015 UTC,"Alas my exposure is letting me down again, this is a constant thing that I'm working on improving, I need to shot with a filter on really bright days I think. I shoot in manual but it's a learning curve I guess, I feel like I've improved but the exposure is a constant thing, which in turns ends up with me messing with the contrast too much in post"

Try to get face and hands, even if it's a candid shot, take several until you get one just right. Obviously, positioning would have been completely different. Then use post to bring out detail in dust and grittiness of the action. Probably would have to do a faster shutter too."

Quite a few of the pictures are a bit too dark for my taste; take Unplug for instance - great colors, good pose, great idea and pretty well executed.. but then you have to squint to see the outlet in his neck! The same for Pandora's Box, it's just too damn dark. I like the Jumberlack but the angled horizon grinds my gears. The basketball hoop in the background of The Song's Fire is completely out of place, and the fire is not directly noticeable.   So again: great ideas, not executed flawlessly - the good news is that many of these things can be fixed easily in post with the material you already have!"

photography,3e2f84,dracy69,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:01:43 2015 UTC,"I goto a lot of motorsports events and my advice is try and diversify your photos. I know an oval doesn't make it easy, but I make a point to get several different angles and perspectives during a race so my photos don't end up all looking the same. This might require getting creative, or walking around a lot, or even just as simple as zooming in and out. You can usually take 2-3 photos from a single location and make them all look very unique. Also I find it is much better to leave your audience wanting more than to give them too much. I usually limit my albums to 30-60 photos for an event no matter now many photos I take over the weekend.  27 and 37 are my favorites! You do good work panning so keep it up and don't be afraid to experiment with slower shutters at times! I shoot several around 125-200 to make sure I have some good sharp panning shots then start dropping down to 60, 30, 1/15th and even 1/4! You get a lot of crap but if you are lucky 1 out of 100 might be an amazing shot with tons of blur! Just something to think about."
photography,3e2f84,Hubblesphere,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:24:32 2015 UTC,I think you can push the picture of the plane a bit in post. Should bring out the blue in the sky and the detail on the plane.

photography,3e2f84,aaronjjpr,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:40:59 2015 UTC,I recently went to Glasgow to shoot some street... first time really getting to shoot in a big city and didn't have much time to do so. These are the most decent from the bunch.   I'll point out the one major flaw before anyone because I'm sadly painfully aware: lots of backs. I'm working on this.  One thing I'm actually struggling with is forming some consistency. This is just an album of photos to share here so I don't really mean thematic consistency but more visual/post consistency. Can't seem to nail a look that makes the photos feel congruent but that might be me finding it hard to see them objectively.  https://www.flickr.com/photos/gregaaronporter/sets/72157656171128811

photography,3e3gbf,ACDSee_official,6,Tue Jul 21 17:42:17 2015 UTC,"I honestly had no idea you guys were still around.  Back in the Windows 3.1 / Windows 95 days your viewer was a standard viewer until probably around Windows XP time when the built in viewer was good enough.   For someone like me who hasn't used you guys in more than a decade, where do you see your company in today's photography world?  Are you more for graphics designers, photographers, or other?   Also, and I ask this with respect, how did Apple's Aperture, Adobe Lightroom, and Capture One completely overtake the photography world as ""pro"" tools when you guys have been at this since the 90's?"
photography,3e3gbf,coogie,3,Tue Jul 21 18:06:59 2015 UTC,"Honestly that's a great question. Install base and brand name recognition is a big part of it I think- Adobe and Apple both have immense weight and budget to throw around. Also, admittedly, our Mac implementations just do not have the development resources that those other two have (had* in the case of Aperture), which is an unfortunate reality of having a limitation on development cycles.  You're right in that back in the 90's there was a large install base of ACDSee viewer, but I'd assume you're also correct in that the built in viewer became 'good enough' for a lot of users.  In today's photography world I think we have 3 great alternatives to the ""big"" players, in the PC environment. We often come in at prices below that of competitors, and also are not locked into subscription models. The Pro and Ultimate products both have some fantastic features, like the Light EQ /u/SovietK mentioned in the comments, that we think a lot of prosumers/consumers/amateurs/professionals could really use. We have a dedicated userbase that really supports us and we're trying to engage the audience a bit more to show ourselves off as an alternative to the ""big guys""."

photography,3e3gbf,anonymoooooooose,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:15:20 2015 UTC,"Good times, I wonder how many billions of porn images were viewed with ACDSee in the 90s.   until probably around Windows XP time when the built in viewer was good enough   Also by then hard drives were faster and CPUs were WAY faster so processing a JPG no longer introduced a noticeable delay.   IIRC the secret sauce of ACDSee's fast browsing was preloading a few pictures ahead of whatever image you were looking at. If you browsed quickly enough you could exhaust the buffer and it slowed down."
photography,3e3gbf,rideThe,4,Tue Jul 21 18:24:11 2015 UTC,"I've used ACDSee Classic (2.43) for years—long after it had been replaced by newer versions—for the simple reason that it was extremely fast to launch and sift through images in the same folder (with the mouse wheel), fast to zoom in and out and fit to screen, fast to go full screen, etc.—so much better than the mediocre image preview app built into Windows. The problem is it didn't support color management—and by color management, I don't just mean interpreting colors using embedded profiles in image files (or assuming sRGB for untagged images), I mean mapping to the display's profile properly, something very few image viewers do (and is particularly important on wide gamut displays). Also, it didn't interpolate well when resizing (it was something like nearest-neighbor instead of something like bicubic) so it looked rough. I have since migrated to FastStone Image Viewer because interpolation is done right, but color management still isn't.  Now, something like Adobe Bridge will allow me to browse images and everything will be perfectly color managed, but it's slow to launch and it's not as fast to operate—it's more involved/sophisticated than what I want as a quick image viewer. Same thing with ACDSee Pro, which although it supports color management, is way more than a snappy image viewer.  What is really needed is something as immediate/snappy to launch and convenient as ACDSee Classic (or FastStone Image Viewer, for that matter)—double-click on a JPEG (or other basic formats) and boom it's there—but, crutially, that performs full color management.  Such a simple app doesn't even seem to exist, which blows my mind—though it may exist and I just don't know about it..."

photography,3dzx9g,CholentPot,3,Tue Jul 21 01:59:14 2015 UTC,I'd be interesting in learning your method for that.  I don't have a scanner or enlarger that can handle 4x5 sheet film and that might be a viable option for me besides the obvious contact prints.
photography,3dzx9g,lealchimiste,3,Tue Jul 21 02:19:51 2015 UTC,"ok,  I use a Canon t2i, a copystand (from an enlarger) some macro rings, and a tracing pad. I use an old pentax 50mm 1.8 set at around f/6-8. I put the negatives (35mm or 120) on the tracing pad zoom in using the live view and focus as sharp as I can. I have the camera tethered to Lightroom. I then take a shot between 1/4 to 1.5 seconds RAW, depends on the film stock and the exposure.   After having the negative in lightroom I export into photoshop, invert and mess with the levels. I used to do this in lightroom but it was much to complicated. I export from photoshop as a TIFF and re-import into lightroom and finish it off. The file will usually pick up a load of color noise in photoshop, I'm not sure why maybe one of my steps is messed up, lightroom takes care of the digital noise.   I get some pretty good results. Mind you, I've for the most part only shot expired film home developed whether c-41 or b&w.   My first rig. Album and album.  If you have any expired film you don't want nor need, send it my way and it'll get chewed up by my SLR collection."

I have the Voigtländer Nokton 35 ƒ/1.4, the Jupiter-11 135 ƒ/4 and the Leica Tele-Elmarit-M 90 ƒ/2.8, but the 35 is shamefully soft, I find a 135 a little bit too long for use on a rangefinder, and I prefer the rendering (and the extra stop) on my 85, so the 90 comes out less.  That said, I'm a collector, so I have plenty of options for cameras to shoot with.  If I want to go light I'll use my Olympus µ[mju:]-II or my Yashica T5.  If I fancy an SLR I use a Nikon FE or F4s with a 50 ƒ/1.4 AF-D, or at the moment I'm actually walking around with a Minolta XK with its Rokkor-X 50 ƒ/1.4.  (I only bought it because the upside-down boat viewfinder is mad, I love it!)  The camera I like using most is the Leica, but that's not to say it's the only one I ever shoot with.

I mean wow, did someone forget to pick whether they wanted µ-II or mju:II?  Also, µ is called mu and pronounced mew.  The j in the middle was just unnecessary."

If you take more than a month to pay it off, you will end up paying more than if you had just saved the money and bought it outright.  That's not the end of the world, but you need to be aware of what you're signing up for."
photography,3e2dx3,duck_slug_hybrid,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:16:44 2015 UTC,"Credit is never a 'good' thing, unless it pays itself off.   This isn't true.  Credit is a good thing as long as you have the money to make the payments, and as long as you have a good rate (lots of places offer zero% before x months).  That's one of the reasons why credit exists, consumption smoothing.   It's better to pay bit by bit and not have a large purchase disrupt your spending patterns than to make a huge payment now and have to alter your regular spending habits.  Credit is only bad if you are irresponsible and cannot plan ahead."
photography,3e2dx3,letuotter,14,Tue Jul 21 20:29:03 2015 UTC,"As someone who has struggled with debt for the last 8 years, I would never recommend buying anything unless you have the cash in hand for the entire purchase (mortgages aside, obviously).  I know it happens, and sometimes it's necessary, but that's a slope you don't even want to play with if you don't have to."
photography,3e2dx3,cl0ckwork,4,Tue Jul 21 14:19:53 2015 UTC,"As someone who has financed 4 vehicles, 2 houses and many other things (I'm in my mid 20s)... Debt isn't a bad thing. Debt allows you to do more in the present as long as you are RESPONSIBLE.   There's actually no way you are going to be able to take on a mortgage without a history of credit. That means you need to be using a credit card, taking on small loans (cars) and paying them responsibly.   Debit is something that allows entrepreneurs and small business owners create wealth.   However, I don't think OP has a clear understanding of his financial situation."
photography,3e2dx3,letuotter,2,Tue Jul 21 15:27:14 2015 UTC,"Being a small business owner is vastly different from an independent contractor or sole proprietor, and even moreso from being a regular person.  And I already said that a mortgage doesn't apply to that rule, because no one pays cash for a house unless you're in the mafia.  But you know what speaks louder than a credit score?  Being able to put down 10% or more on a mortgage with cash in hand.  My wife and I rent, but we've been through about 6 cars altogether, and paid cash for each one of them.  Sure, you don't get nice things, but people in America are pretty awful about discipline and telling themselves ""not yet"".  A credit score is literally nothing more than a measure of how well you fit into the American system of treading water and using fake ""responsibility"" as a mask to cover a lack of spending discipline."
photography,3e2dx3,cl0ckwork,2,Tue Jul 21 16:42:09 2015 UTC,"It's a measurement of how well you handle debt and if you can pay your debt back. That's all lenders care about.   Another reason to going into debt is to avoid throwing money each month renting rather than owning. This is true for cameras as it is for a house. For example, we pay less on our mortgage (2k+ sq foot, nice neighborhood) than we did renting a condo. And we now have an asset that can be sold .  The idea that you shouldn't have a credit card or finance things because 'fuck the fuckers' is to not be in reality. How lenders view credit isn't going anywhere anytime soon. You are best to play the game ."
photography,3e2dx3,letuotter,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:35:23 2015 UTC,"We rent for about $200 more per month than an average mortgage would cost us, but by the time you factor in property taxes, we're saving money.  That part all depends on where you are.  And anyway, I'll say FOR THE THIRD GODDAMNED TIME THAT MORTGAGES ARE NOT A PART OF THIS CONVERSATION.  THEY ARE AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT CATEGORY OF DEBT AND A SEPARATE CONVERSATION ALTOGETHER.  And the ""it's just the way things are"" argument just sounds like another way of admitting that things are broken, but no one feels like doing anything about it, even though the credit lending industry is literally choking out an entire generation.  Financing something on credit might be faster, and you might be forced into it at times, but don't try to pretend that it's somehow more responsible or required as a given part of life, because it's just flat-out not."
photography,3e2dx3,HowitzerIII,2,Tue Jul 21 18:45:04 2015 UTC,"It seems like OP is in a similar situation. He's losing money slowly by renting equipment. If he made payments on some debt, it's conceivable that he doesn't lose as much compared with renting. He's paying monthly payments, but a majority of that goes towards the value of his equipment.   It all comes down to how certain you are of your borrowing and paying back."

I didn't reference the economy as some sort of holy uncle sam fest. I completely understand that our financial system is broken. This notion that I am ok with how the government regulates the financial industry is a strawman. I comply because the cost benefit of resisting debt and not taking advantage of the benefits doesn't make sense. The government inflates money through borrowing and printing. You are crazy to save cash in this type of economy.   To not take on debt and have credit because you disagree with the system is only hurting yourself.   You aren't saving money by renting, because each month all of that money does not go towards any EQUITY or ASSETS. You aren't converting your cash into anything that's valuable in the long term. Even if your mortgage was slightly higher you would still be paying towards ownership of property which is what I am trying to point out. Debt allows this to be possible. And, you can still deduct your mortgage from your taxable income (federally) which is HUGE.   It's the same with gear. If you pay 3-400 to rent gear each wedding you could easily have had a 1-200 a month payment for a 2 year loan to buy all the gear outright. And, at the end of it all you could sell your gear.  It's better to finance things sometimes."

You are forced to take on credit cards and pay through the nose in fees and interest and 99% of all people with such cards, overspend.    I haven't had debt for over 20 years now, have no credit card, plenty of funds in the bank and no problems falling asleep at night! Once you break out of that evil cycle of debt and more debt, life becomes great.    The trick is always to live below your means. So, now I save a lot of money each month that others pay to credit card companies and banks and when I need something, I order it and pay for it and that's all there is to it."
photography,3e2dx3,cl0ckwork,5,Tue Jul 21 16:28:03 2015 UTC,"Every purchase I make is on my credit card. I pay 0 interest. You obviously don't understand how credit cards work.

photography,3e2dx3,evanrphoto,5,Tue Jul 21 20:04:11 2015 UTC,"I think the best approach is to start with the necessities and older lenses or 1.8 primes and buy used when you find a good deal and then resell when you have more cash for a better lens or body. Generally if you are smart about your purchases and are not holding the gear for long you can resell for the same price you bought it for. Heck, I even used to make money by doing this.  Depending how much business you do renting can get expensive fast. I keep an entire second set of gear just because my wife seconds with me occasionally and I hate renting.  Credit is often over used these days, even with businesses. I would try to see if there is anyway you could swing it without extending yourself."

I don't currently own a second body, and renting one is the main thing taking away from my profits (hence why I'd like to buy it)."
photography,3e2dx3,FlippedStomach,3,Tue Jul 21 13:09:18 2015 UTC,You say you have the funds to purchase the 6D. You could purchase the camera on credit and then make payments from your reserves. If anything unexpected comes up then you can spend your cash as needed while at the same time minimizing the interest charges. If nothing pressing comes up in your finances while you are paying for the camera you will come out fairly unscathed.

You're paying interest/going into debt in order to avoid going into debt later? That doesn't make sense. If you have an emergency later on, just use your credit then. At least in that situation you're not sitting on a bunch of credit card debt for a longer amount of time..."

Just an opinion. I pay with tons of stuff on credit then immediately pay it off either that day or at the end of the week. Credit score is awesome and it racks up my perks pretty quick."
photography,3e2dx3,lukejc1,3,Tue Jul 21 15:08:33 2015 UTC,"The majority of businesses use some sort of credit to get started. By renting gear you are technically doing mini short term loans.  However , since startup costs are so low with photography I advise to avoid it if possible. Is there really no way to pick up side jobs and accumulate wealth due to not shooting a full schedule?  However, if you have weddings on the books and you have a solid business plan it will help you achieve your goals faster.  Nobody here can tell you if you should or should not. You need to have a business plan that outlines how you will succeed. It can't be up to chance. If you aren't sure if you are going to pay off the loan than your answer is clear."
photography,3e2dx3,cmtrinks,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:02:33 2015 UTC,"Exactly. It's almost the norm to take out a loan in order to start a business (though perhaps not in photography). Typically you create a business plan, explaining exactly what you're going to do, how much money you expect to make (and when) etc. etc.   You then present the business plan to a bank and if everything looks ok they will approve a small business loan. The interest on a business loan ought to be much lower than on a consumer credit card or store financing deal."
photography,3e2dx3,FlippedStomach,3,Tue Jul 21 14:54:35 2015 UTC,If you can get a 0% interest financing period and feel confident you can pay it off before interest accrues then go for it.  That's how I bought much of my gear.
photography,3e2dx3,Camjammerz,5,Tue Jul 21 15:04:31 2015 UTC,"I always buy electronics on credit for two reasons. One being that if anything happens to it while its being delivered, the credit card company will replace the item/refund your money (capital one.) Secondly, and most importantly Capital One offers and extended warranty for anything purchased using their credit card..so a normal 1 year warranty becomes 2 or 3 years depending on what card you have."
photography,3e2dx3,bigpipes84,3,Tue Jul 21 13:31:25 2015 UTC,"This is probably the best reason to use credit, although I think it would still be smart to pay off the entire debt as soon as you get your item and know that it's not damaged."
photography,3e2dx3,mrdat,2,Tue Jul 21 14:39:17 2015 UTC,"Have you considered long-term rental? A franchise in AUS rents gear out from anywhere between 3-15 dollars a week, depending on how expensive the gear is.  I think you get locked into 6 months though, and then you have the option to buy at a discount. It's more expensive than just buying the gear outright, but over 2 years it works out to ~2x the price.  Example: I bought my 24mm f/2.8 ef-s lens outright for $210AU but could have rented for $3/week. Would have cost me $156 for a full year, $312 for 2 years at which point I could buy it for $4 outright.  http://www.teds.com.au/canon-ef-s-24mm-f2-8-stm   Total would have been under 2x the outright cost, but renting at $12-13/month wouldn't have been terrible if I really didn't have the money."

Loans like that paid on time or early and paid in full always look good for future borrowing.  But like I've seen elsewhere in this thread, don't buy if there isn't business to support it."

photography,3e2dx3,cakes_and_pies,2,Tue Jul 21 14:08:35 2015 UTC,"It sounds like your bank account is your safety net / cushion, and you're worried about emptying your account by spending that kind of money all at once? I can see why it would be easier to justify a big purchase on deferred interest, but I don't think it's such a great idea.  I say this from experience, as a guy who has bought gear on credit (deferred interest) while having all the cash in hand to purchase it outright. All it takes is two screwups and you're caught deciding between ludicrous interest charges or compromising elsewhere in your life to make things meet. Sure, your cash can pay the remainder of the financed charges (if barely), but if your income is interrupted (gigs cancel), or you are forced to spend that cash elsewhere (primary body dies, car needs repair, etc) and then something else comes up - what then? It's a close call, and a very very risky one at that as most store cards and promotional cards that offer deferred interest do so with a 25%+ interest rate ticking away in the background.  Despite successfully doing exactly what you describe twice - except my interest is purely as a hobby, not income-earning - I think the best avenue is to keep saving until you have enough of a cushion to comfortably part with all of it at once. You can still buy stuff on credit for easy returns/chargebacks, extra points, fraud protection, etc but do so as though the money you spent was well and truly gone when you spent it. There's countless folks out there that danced on that high wire and fell off into an abyss of debt because of it: don't be one of them."
photography,3e2dx3,Cowboy-beebop,2,Tue Jul 21 15:23:32 2015 UTC,"I've payed for a majority of my gear on 0% interest over blahblahblah month cards and never been an issue. I know best buy has a card that anything over $400 is 12 months zero interest, but they always bump to 18 over the holidays, so if you can wait till November, you'd be in a good spot. Make sure you can make your monthly payments and you'd be set. I also made a point of every single job I landed I would take half of it to make a payment."

If you've got jobs lined up so you're just buffering the cashflow around it's not a bad plan, if you're buying with the assumption you'll have enough money later it's a bit more of a risk. I'd make sure you work out what the payments will be, when they're needed by and what happens should you miss them etc so you can tell fast if you're getting in trouble.  Also (because I recomend this to everyone) consider looking at refurbished cameras to save a bit of dough but still get 'as new' with a warranty etc. Usually they're items that have had little to no use, because there was a problem, that has now been fixed. I've bought both my last two bodies refurb and I think my 70d had had < 600 shutter counts with no other signs of use. Saved around 20% of the price doing that!"

Got myself a 5D3, 24-70mm f2.8 ii and 135mm f2.0.  I had the funds available to buy it all outright but at 0% finance I didn't really see the point, figured I would put down half and pay the rest over 2 years. After the trade up bonus I received on the body (£450 bonus on top of my DSLR part-ex) and the discounts that were running on L lenses at the time (15% off) it seemed like the perfect excuse to upgrade.  As long as you have a steady job / income and are confident that you can make the monthly payments then I would say go for it (especially if you can find a 0% deal)."

If you pay $1000 in credit (to use simple numbers) and you have 15-20% interest on that card, that is going to be between $150-200 you are paying in interest per month. If you aren't careful, that is going to be an easy way to slip into debt and pay significantly more over time for that body/lens.  I price what I shoot accordingly for what I rent in gear.

photography,3e2w0n,AllOverShoe,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:21:20 2015 UTC,"I just had a kid 7 days ago so I will be watching this thread like a hawk.  Some tips I've got for newborns:   Take pics within the first 3-4 weeks, it's when they sleep the most Take pics right after a feeding, it's when they're sleepiest and you can pose them easiest Keep the room warm and they'll be easier to keep asleep. Big softboxes or natural light and a reflector seem to look best on the babies' skin Reduce clarity and contrast in post because babies are generally red/blotchy   Also suggest a ton of wipes/diapers because kids shit constantly.    For an example, I took this pic of my newborn about an hour ago in my apt near a window.    I don't really have any tips for older than newborns although I know it can pay to keep a familiar face near/above your lens because the child will be more inclined to look at someone they know than your lens.  Also go on Pinterest and search around.  There are a million newborn and kids BTS pics and articles."
photography,3e2w0n,johnny5ive,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:25:22 2015 UTC,"/u/johnny5ive has good advice. I just tried to take photos of my 3 week old last night and (having no prior experience in newborn photography) it was difficult to get things happening the way I wanted them to happen.  I'm also pretty new to using artificial lighting, so there was a lot of trial and error there.  I feel like I got a halfway decent one but he wasn't asleep so that made things difficult.  Also, I learned a bit about my lack of editing ability.  Sleeping babies are much easier to deal with, so lots of food beforehand and a warm environment can go a long way.  Good luck!"

photography,3e37bo,Carguy91246,2,Tue Jul 21 17:06:45 2015 UTC,"Another T3i or even a cheaper T2i might be better for video than the D3200. Regardless, the D3200 will still give you great video. If it were me purchasing it, I would go for the body only and pick up something like a 35mm 1.8G. But you still might want go for the 2 lens kit, because body only is $300, so $120 for the 18-55 and 55-200. You may even be able to resell the 2 lenses on eBay for a profit."
photography,3e37bo,geekygeekz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:12:33 2015 UTC,I'd personally skip the 50-200mm and wireless adapter and just get the basic kit lens. After you've shoot for a while you might have a better idea what kind of upgrade you need (probably lens) and you can use the money then.

Also keep in mind that you will need to invest in full frame lenses, which can sometimes be more costly than their crop equivalents.

photography,3e3m8h,finaleclipse,3,Tue Jul 21 18:37:29 2015 UTC,"Lenses will run you as much as you want to spend.    For astro:     Popular budget option, the Rokinon 14mm f2.8 for $350 Legendary Nikon zoom, the 14-24mm f2.8 for $2,000   For portraits:     Nikon 85mm f1.8 for $500 Nikon 85mm f1.4 for $1,700   If you go the D750 route, you'll probably need to go with the Rokinon 14mm and Nikon 85mm f1.8 since you'll be sinking more into the body. If you go the D7200 route, then you might be able to swing for a better lens. It's where you feel your priorities lay."

photography,3e1ouk,ferdterguson,2,Tue Jul 21 07:55:43 2015 UTC,"Usually it's not so cut and dry, but when I read OPs title I thought the same thing 'yes'  If you want to be stuck with a single focal length then the Fuji X100s might be noteworthy contender tho for image quality, but RX100 is still a very strong performer   The RX100 is a great video shooter as well if you're into that (1080p @60fps)  One thing I'd like to add though is that if you don't mind not having an EVF and 28mm rather than 24mm, you can save quite a bit by buying RX100 Mark I. IQ will be the same"
photography,3e1ouk,BrandonV09,3,Tue Jul 21 12:35:16 2015 UTC,"I agree.  The sensor changes (BSI) and lens changes across generations are incremental, and I always recommend a non-enthusiast JPG point-and-shooter to grab the earlier generation for better value"
photography,3e1ouk,ferdterguson,3,Tue Jul 21 12:39:51 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind though, that the Mark I and II have a rather slow lens on the tele end of the zoom range. I'd personally be more inclined to go with the Mark III or IV. I'd also be pissed that I didn't have a hotshoe, so maybe the Mark V is for me :P"
photography,3e1ouk,definitelyright,2,Tue Jul 21 14:57:28 2015 UTC,"Yes, the brighter lens is important, and also you should get at least the mark iii if you want to have a viewfinder (because otherwise when there's a lot of glare and you couldn't see the screen very well, it would be hard to use the camera.)  The Mark IV might be overkill for some people (the signature feature is the 4K video shooting that not everyone cares about) but the mark iv also has better autofocus, which is important, a much higher resolution viewfinder, faster shooting, and a few other feature improvements, if the high price doesn't bother you.  Here's a link to a comparison chart."
photography,3e1ouk,uncletravellingmatt,6,Tue Jul 21 18:41:03 2015 UTC,"Yep, pretty good for such a small camera.   24mm is wide enough for most landscape, you can also use panorama mode is you're shooting jpegs. 70mm is IMHO a bit short for portraits but you can always crop a bit those 20MP files. Decent subject isolation at max aperture Decent macro mode (unfortunately at the wide end) The popup viewfinder is amazing, while everybody is squinting in the sun to see their LCD, you can shoot without a problem. And it's so amazing. Built-in ND3 filter !! Handy for long exposure Auto, priority and manual modes !   I recommend you to take a small tripod like a gorillapod and a bunch of cheap batteries with an external charger.  With a gorillapod you'll be able to hugely enhance your landscape in low light : switch to manual focus, compose the shot, close the aperture to f/4 (sharpest), set ISO to 125 (base) and profit !! Also use the ND filter for a longer exposure.  source : I'm living in Europe and I have a RX100 III"
photography,3e1ouk,rieramaxime,4,Tue Jul 21 09:05:14 2015 UTC,The rx100 is normally considered the best. I think something like the Canon g1x or something is a close alternative.
photography,3e1ouk,MughalPrince22,4,Tue Jul 21 07:48:18 2015 UTC,You can't do much better if the rx covers the zoom range you want and you don't need interchangeable lenses. Invest in a second battery though.
photography,3e1ouk,san_salvador,4,Tue Jul 21 09:07:18 2015 UTC,"No camera is ""the best"", but the RX-100 III will definitely deliver quality images!"
photography,3e1ouk,cakes_and_pies,4,Tue Jul 21 13:53:36 2015 UTC,IQ is stunning and about the same as on M4/3 sensors. I'd definitely take the M3 over M1 or M2 because of the EVF if you are going to shoot a lot outside. It can also rotate its Screen 180° so it's very useful for selfies.  I just got it a few days ago and its just awesome :)
photography,3e1ouk,algorithmsAI,2,Tue Jul 21 16:28:52 2015 UTC,"IQ is stunning and about the same as on M4/3 sensors   In daylight yes, though the M4/3 sensor is about twice the size, putting it closer to the APS-C standard than the RX100s 1"" sensor. As a result, and comparing equivalent technology generations, the M4/3 cameras will outperform the RX100s in low light, and provide more control over depth-of-field.  edited for: confusing crop factor with sensor size"
photography,3e1ouk,vjayalaya,4,Tue Jul 21 18:23:33 2015 UTC,"Lenses matter too, not just sensor size. If you're making a m4/3 camera into the best equivalent 'pocket sized' set-up with a retracting zoom lens that will be f/3.5 -- f/5.6 (with a similar zoom range to the rx100 models), then the rx100 mark iii or iv with the f/1.8 -- f/2.8 zoom lens might actually be the better low-light performer."
photography,3e1ouk,uncletravellingmatt,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:56:31 2015 UTC,"True, though I was more pointing out that in an absolute sense the M4/3 sensor will outperform the 1"" sensor, most noticeably in low light.  The system around the sensor of course matters as well. There are f/1.7 and f/2.8 pancake primes available for the M4/3 system, though they aren't stabilized (unless you mount them to a somewhat larger Olympus E-PL7) and the Pana LX100 uses a slightly cropped M4/3 sensor with a stabilized f/1.7-2.8 zoom lens.    F-Stop indicates light intensity (which impacts exposure/shutter speed), rather than total light, which is both the intensity of the light and the size of the sensor (and impacts dynamic range).     Whether OP cares about RAW dynamic range (at this stage, doubtful), or would consider buying and switching between different lenses, or even cares about low-light performance and shallow depth of field, is another matter entirely.  edit: To add: no one should buy an interchangeable lens camera if they aren't planning on changing lenses, for exactly the reason you pointed out.  Of course, my friends always seem to ignore this advice when they run out to get a Canon Rebel or Nikon D3XXX with no intention of ever using something other than the kit lens."
photography,3e1ouk,vjayalaya,5,Tue Jul 21 19:20:59 2015 UTC,"If your main priority is IQ then perhaps the Ricoh GR or the GR II. You will get a sharper lens, much bigger sensor and more dynamic range, better low light ISO performance. http://www.dxomark.com/Cameras/Compare/Side-by-side/Sony-Cyber-shot-DSC-RX100-II-versus-Ricoh-GR___896_874"
photography,3e1ouk,xprocessed,2,Tue Jul 21 13:15:41 2015 UTC,That was actually the second camera I was looking at. Why are you the only one to mention it?... It seems like it has more what I'm looking for.
photography,3e1ouk,vjayalaya,2,Tue Jul 21 16:41:08 2015 UTC,"I think most people assumed that you would want a zoom lens.  The Ricoh GR I and II have fixed focal length lenses with a field of view similar that of the average smart-phone.  If you can live with that, and never need to zoom in on anything, then it's a great option."
photography,3e1ouk,sideswiped,2,Tue Jul 21 17:08:41 2015 UTC,"It's a niche prosumer (intermediate/pro) camera with a fixed 28mm equivalent wide angle lense. Performance is noticeably better than the RX100, but you loose the reach that the RX100's zoom gives you. If you're a novice, the RX100 may be better suited to your needs. (I say that as a GR and RX100 MI owner)"
photography,3e1ouk,Mistercheese,2,Tue Jul 21 17:10:28 2015 UTC,"I've found it even more pocketable than the RX100, and the ergonomics are fantastic. It just does what I want. The biggest thing you give up is the zoom, when not everyone loves the 28mm focal length."
photography,3e1ouk,vjayalaya,2,Tue Jul 21 18:03:27 2015 UTC,"Here is my vote for the best in each size category.  I assume that a camera must be comfortably worn in said pocket for a full day, day after day.  I also assume that you will want a zoom lens, so I've ruled out any compacts with fixed single focal length lenses.     Size Category Fixed Lens Interchangeable Lens    Fitted Pants Pocket Canon S120, Sony RX100 n/a   Loose Pants Pocket Sony RX100 II, III, IV n/a   Jacket Pocket Sony RX100 II, III, IV Pana GM1, GM5   Purse/Small Messenger Bag Pana LX100, Canon G1X II Pana GM1, GM5, Olympus E-PL7, Sony a5000, a6000    And finally, you have to consider lens size as well for the interchangeable lens category, so I've only included cameras which can be had with collapsible zooms, which sadly rules out Fuji. And by all means, let me know if I've missed something, though this list is intended to be my recommendations in each category, rather than an exhaustive list in each category."

The couple of weddings I've shot for friends have both been very relaxed affairs, with (relatively) little pressure as a photographer.  But I think it's important people realise that isn't always the case. Volunteering to photograph a friend's wedding for free/cheap can put a big strain on a friendship if the happy couple have unrealistic expectations."
photography,3dxo2m,TheJunkyard,8,Mon Jul 20 14:27:40 2015 UTC,"Well, you modify your behaviour to ensure you don't hit the same snag twice. I got very lucky (i've met some couples that I know would not be anywhere near as accomodating)  I now make sure to arrive early and keep my spare lenses inside the venue prior to the wedding, so if my lens starts fogging from coming in from the cold I have another that is at ambient temperature.  But yeah, as a general rule, I try not to shoot for people I know. It could get awkward if things go south. Selfishly though, that's not the main reason I try not to do them.  If I give up my Friday/Saturday not only am I giving them a wedding present worth £2000+, but it prevents me from working  and earning that day.

The fuel for the site visits to your clients home, place of ceremony, the reception venue, the pre-wedding shoots venue. Your food (not all clients will feed you, remember that!) on the day. Your film if you're shooting on it. Your assistants fee. Your hotel stay if it's a long way from where you live.  Then there is your time. All these visits. Being on your feet from 6am till whatever time the party stops (just because your bride leaves doesn't mean the wedding is over!). The sheer amount of time editing... Jesus... I might shoot 3000-4000 images across a wedding. Just picking the ones I want to edit is a days work in itself. I usually spend 3-4 days at 8-9 hours a day editing images.   £2000 means for each day I am working I earn about £110.00. I then have to pay income tax on that. I have my bills to pay from that. I have to eat. My baby daughter has to eat.  Sorry to go on, but what i'm trying to say is unless you turned up and took a dozen snaps then gave them the CF card afterwards, you definately gave them an amazeballs wedding present certainly valued at A LOT of money. Even though it was fucking awesome for you to step up and do it, don't devalue yourself, or your time for that matter. Living is expensive. You probably gave them the most valuable gift they could ever get, apart from each other of course."
photography,3dxo2m,Griddamus,3,Mon Jul 20 15:37:56 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I have considered shooting weddings for a living. I dearly love photography, but I have a steady income from a more boring source right now, which I don't think I'm quite ready to throw away in exchange for a riskier venture. Maybe one day.  I certainly wouldn't undervalue my time if I was doing it professionally. You're quite right about how the expenses mount up. My point was just that I, as an amateur doing my best for some friends, didn't incur most of the expenses you're talking about. I was shooting on relatively inexpensive equipment, without an assistant to pay, and being given lifts and places to stay by friends who were going along anyway.  I can certainly relate in terms of editing time, mind you. I think I shot around 2,500 captures in total, and I spent days perfecting the final album for them in post-processing.  They appreciated it for sure, and I was 90% happy with the end result, but there are many things I would want to do better if I was a professional they were relying upon to get everything just right."
photography,3dxo2m,TheJunkyard,6,Mon Jul 20 16:31:33 2015 UTC,"I was 90% happy with the end result, but there are many things I would want to do better    This is exactly the right attitude to take to photography as you must be critical of your own work all the time in order to improve.  I'm glad you are happy doing what you are and your friends are super lucky to have you shoot for them. All the best, and with that attitude you should be able to attain the best :)"

photography,3dxo2m,TheJunkyard,4,Tue Jul 21 09:49:56 2015 UTC,"First kiss, rings on the fingers, bouquet toss, smashing of the glass, garter toss, father/mother/brother toasting, etc.   There are a ton of moments in a wedding that you are expected to nail. So yeah, if you miss a single shot, you can be in some seriously hot water."
photography,3dxo2m,WorkingISwear,14,Mon Jul 20 14:13:49 2015 UTC,"I don't think I have ever shot their rings on their fingers. This is 2015, not 1975. Posed over the bouquet, perhaps?  Sometimes the priest jumps the gun on the kiss and does it at a weird time or the groom give a tiny little peck. I've gotten a shot a split second before their lips touched, then second frame was a split second after. B&G never cared. Sometimes the bouquet catch isn't in focus because focus isn't always easy to achieve in a dark hall. When was the last time you went to someone's house and saw a big 20x30 print of a bouquet toss?  If you can't get a nice frame of a toast, then you need to reevaluate your career choices. They stand there for a few minutes in a single place and talk. Nothing could be easier.   Again, most people aren't going to notice if you miss something or even a couple things you should have hit. And even if you do, it isn't the end of the world. It's a picture of someone smashing cake in someone else's face. If you are a cop or a soldier and you mess up, maybe you die or someone else dies. Maybe a riot starts. If you are a wedding photographer and miss a shot, someone might briefly notices it, but there is a good chance no one will ever notice."
photography,3dxo2m,texasphotog,4,Mon Jul 20 14:27:25 2015 UTC,"I didn't imply that any time you miss one of these things, you're screwed, but you can be. Whether it's the mother of the bride looking for these shots, or the groom himself handing you a shot list (huge pet peeve of mine), it doesn't matter. People can, and will, get upset. I've seen it happen. And when your clients are paying $10k for you to shoot a single day of their life, yeah, you want to get everything.    I don't think I have ever shot their rings on their fingers. This is 2015, not 1975.    I meant when they're actually putting the rings on each other during the ceremony.    When was the last time you went to someone's house and saw a big 20x30 print of a bouquet toss   When was the last time you went to someone's house and saw more than one or two of the hundreds of frames that may have been delivered to them? That's not the point at all."
photography,3dxo2m,WorkingISwear,3,Mon Jul 20 14:30:56 2015 UTC,I meant when they're actually putting the rings on each other during the ceremony.    I only have a couple photos of that. Most of the time I'm over 200ft away in the back of the chapel.
photography,3dxo2m,CakesArePies,4,Mon Jul 20 15:32:40 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Some couples might be understanding about that kind of thing, particularly if they understand beforehand that you're not a pro. Others, however, might hold a grudge against you forever."
photography,3dxo2m,TheJunkyard,3,Mon Jul 20 14:22:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, our photog didn't take a shot of the whole wedding party in front of the church. My wife and I never thought of that, but my mom and my mother in law were both pissed and had words about it with the photographer."
photography,3dxo2m,NotClever,2,Mon Jul 20 18:59:23 2015 UTC,"Well I was partially joking, but you really don't have to miss every shot to screw up big time.  I'm completely down with the whole ""relax and have fun"" vibe. Getting overly stressed is the worst thing you can do. But I also think it's vital to manage expectations with the bride and groom before the wedding.  If it's your first ever shoot, let them know you're not a pro, and the end results may not be everything they're hoping for. If they want guaranteed results, they need to bite the bullet and pay someone who knows what they're doing.  If they're willing to take a risk to save money, and you're getting experience and a portfolio out of it, then everyone's a winner. As long as they know beforehand what they're getting themselves into."
photography,3dxo2m,TheJunkyard,2,Mon Jul 20 14:20:10 2015 UTC,"Yes and no. I did miss an important shot that was requested (though my contract clearly says that I'll do my best but can't guarantee).  The parents of the bride were separated and she asked if she could get some of her mom and dad dancing, if they did.  They did, I thought I got it (or my second shooter did), turned out we hadn't :( They weren't angry, but definitely disappointed that it was missed.    This was my only semi-nightmare wedding.  It was fine during, but after it seemed like they were disappointed in the delivery.  The bride never talked to me, all communication seemed to go through the mom (ie: bride didn't answer the phone, and I had the bride's mother calling me).  They wanted some selective color (ugh) which I said I'd ""try"" to do in the initial consult, and they wanted more of the groom doing a song to his bride (though honestly the 3 or 4 I had of him basically covered everything he was doing, I thought anyway), and I think they were a bit disappointed in the number of images delivered (300 or so).  So I sucked it up, appolagized and gave them 'the rest' (which was about 200 more that were the ""ok"" ones and multiple shots of the same thing, which I told them is what it was, but they said basically ""why yes, I definitely want 8 shots of the exact same thing"".   Haven't heard from them since sadly :(  Lessons learned I guess."
photography,3dxo2m,arcterex,2,Mon Jul 20 18:25:12 2015 UTC,"The bride never talked to me, all communication seemed to go through the mom    This is red flag #1 for us. Every time a wedding has been planned like that, there have been issues."
photography,3dxo2m,texasphotog,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:27:56 2015 UTC,"This was mostly just the post-wedding communication, or rather the communication after the digital images were delivered.  That's when she was ""busy"" and her mom called me to pass on info.  The pre-wedding communication was with the bride and mom, as mom was (as far as I could tell) footing the bill.  She was there but not super involved, but yea, I had that little twinge in the back of my head that this might be an issue.  So as someone who is (relatively) new to this gig, what's the correct way to deal with a mom like this?"
photography,3dxo2m,arcterex,3,Mon Jul 20 19:30:42 2015 UTC,This is why I stopped shooting video of weddings.  No matter how well I shot or edited a wedding video I would have the bride ask me if I shot great aunt milly hugging little jonathon after the wedding.  It would eat me up inside that I missed capturing this incredible moment that meant so much to this family when my job was to capture these moments.
photography,3dxo2m,dblan9,2,Mon Jul 20 15:53:30 2015 UTC,You don't have a clause in your contract that says you're not liable to capture EVERY moment at the wedding because of the arbitrary nature of the event?
photography,3dxo2m,betaphaggot,4,Mon Jul 20 16:12:58 2015 UTC,Yes and every bride was completely fine that it wasn't captured but I beat myself up over it.  It was psychological on my part and not in fact a reality.
photography,3dxo2m,dblan9,0,Mon Jul 20 16:30:10 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. The bride and groom might have a huge laundry list of photos, but if you are able to be creative and seek other moments that will be far better than the regular old shots at every wedding."

But this is the most questionable comment, IMHO:   I see wedding photographers as being like directors of a movie.   Do you really want a wannabe Spielberg ""directing"" everyone at your wedding?"
photography,3dxo2m,spam-musubi,15,Tue Jul 21 01:14:58 2015 UTC,"*Small edit - What I'm trying to say by not getting nervous, is that I assisted wedding photographers before going solo, which everyone on the planet should do, but rarely happens. It'd be like having someone hire you to weld an important part of a car frame back together, and all you've done in regard to welding is make boxes for fun at school. Is it possible? Sure, but you only have one shot at a wedding. And it's pretty selfish to do it without practice and working under a professional.    uh, the only time I was nervous was when I assisted a new wedding photographer. Or if someone was crazy about getting a certain photo I knew wasn't possible(like copying a photo from a magazine in a city, when we are at a country club).  Also there is some pretty bad advice in it.   When you shoot a wedding, you’re shooting for the album. So you have to ask: Would the bride and groom want that photo in an album? If you’re going to take another shot, is that next shot really better than the shot you just took? If not, don’t take it   ""Sorry guys, I didn't think you wanted that photo in your album  so I didn't take it. Next time let me know ok?""    Overall this article is pretty blah.   The experienced photographer will shoot a photo and say, “I ain’t clicking again until I get something better than what I just shot.”   Wrong. 99% of the time you don't know what you have when you take it. Acting like you have a clue what your photos are on a 2 inch screen is silly. The second you think you have the shot, it's probably the one that's 2mm out of focus. Stuff happens, people breath.   So what happens is that you end up having 2,000 or 3,000 shots, and you’re creating more work for yourself, because you have to cull all of those shots. You have to pick out the good ones for your clients.   Duh, that's the point? It takes me a whole 2 hours tops to ""cull"" an album. Why not have extras for my client? What if they don't like an exact photo and ask for an alternative? (happens all the time). ""Sorry, I took the best one, so I stopped taking photos.""   Because you can get so busy and focused on looking at one little area through your viewfinder that you’re not pulling back and with both eyes looking around at what’s happening. Maybe if you were to just step back and look four feet to your right, there could be an amazing moment right there that you missed.   I have so many candids by the end of the day, that's actually what stops me from taking so many photos. ""missed moments"" is silly. I can easily give my clients 500 candids of ""moments,"" but it's just too much.   Scott Robert Lim: I think it’s when you develop a relationship with your clients and they trust you, and they’re having a good time with you. They’re buying into who you are and what you’re doing, and it’s a teamwork type of thing. You feel like, “Hey, we’re in this together.” There’s this synergy that happens, and things come together.  Those are the best weddings........   The silver lining here is that regardless of how hard you try, some couples will not trust you. Not until the photos are 100% edited for the third time and in their hands. Sometimes you need to step back and think about wasting time building trust. I don't expect my clients to trust a stranger they barely know on their wedding day. And it's not always about you. 90% of the stories out there about ruined wedding photos are from someone not having backups(if you remove the I only paid $300, my photographer sucks, what do?).    Look, weddings are simple. Anxiety is silly. You are a professional, doing a professional practice. Treat it that way. You don't need to build some trust relationship, just be yourself and do everything you can for the couple that needs to be done. Most of the time if someone trusts you, it's for reasons other than your 3 phone calls and engagement photos before the wedding. Focus on your work, shoot 5,000 photos if you want, you will know when it's time to take less, some article telling you to take less is a terrible idea. I work with professionals that still take 4,000 photos a wedding because there are times when the bride and groom are a little difficult to work with (pretty rare), and you just keep shooting.  By the end of the night you feel much better by having an extra 500 photos than not."

I don't have some huge network of friends or people to boost my confidence levels in regard to my quality of work. I also don't have people that just trust me because I knew them before I picked up my camera.  But I will guarantee you that a professional's quality of work will easily outshine yours in a blind test. Unless you are a prodigy to wedding photography.   Are the shots technically better? Probably not, but it doesn't matter because its the emotion that trumps anything else.   This is such a bad way of thinking about shooting. If your main focus is emotion and client trust, once your source of people that already trust you runs out, it's going to be damn tough.  And furthermore, I'm not sure what else to tell you that's constructive. You seem very ornery about your opinions. You make very matter of fact statements like ""it doesn't matter because its the emotion that trumps anything else.""

I know the incrimental cost of each shot is negligable in terms of dollars and cents.

I explained that I'm still an amateur and although I have a nice portfolio, a wedding is a big venture but they were okay with it. Much better than having crappy guest cell phone picks.   They also invited a friend of theirs to act as a second photographer just in case I missed the shot.  So everything went well and I have been sending them the photos through the internet so they can post online before I send them the disk. In one shot during one of those unity candle lighting things, the angle I was at forced me to crop out the groom's mother, because the groom was in the way during this time. It was still a nice shot of the others, so I edited and sent it. The groom asked me why his mom was cropped out, so I had to explain to him that these things happen, AND point out that the 2nd photographer got the shot of everyone.  It wasn't a big deal to me, but it shows that the bride and groom will have different expectations of what those must have shots are. They never told me that this was a super important shot to them prior to the ceremony, or maybe the groom was just nitpicking.. I don't know. It sort of bothered me a bit."

photography,3dzv1s,Dzeeraajs,2,Tue Jul 21 15:32:39 2015 UTC,"I believe it was Tyson Robichaud's review that insisted measuring the equivalency of this lens (both in value and capacity for focus falloff) to that of a 50mm f/1.2 on full frame, simply cropped in. It's an accurate assessment. The images I see from my friends with 85mm f/1.4 lenses, for example, deliver enormously more attractive separation of subject from background and it's a look I adore, but I'm willing to accept compromises in this case because I really don't want to move away from the Micro Four Thirds format (for sake of my real estate work, the inherent broader depth of field is useful in that paying work).  I'll always want greater capabilities to slice the plane of focus paper thin, and eventually I don't think I'll be able to resist picking up full frame to achieve it. For the limitations of Micro Four Thirds, however, this lens, albeit crazy expensive, is a terrific middle ground in making that plane of focus thin enough in a useful fashion (being wickedly sharp wide open).  My bed is made in M4/3 by virtue of investment in glass and bodies - I will absolutely grab at every opportunity to diminish the barriers accepted upon entry into the system (and not have jealousy pangs about FF or MF ""looks"").  :)"
photography,3dzv1s,Dzeeraajs,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:18:47 2015 UTC,"The deal with the small formats is that the wicked sharpness wide open is easily and cheaply had from certain f2.8 primes on full frame.   I think that m43 has its advantages in wideangle primes, where there is a real size benefit and the aperture disadvantage is mostly meaningless. (14/2.4 is only beaten in all aspects by the fixed lens compact GR and Coolpix A, and there's nothing for the 12/2)   But when you get to fast telephoto primes you're paying for the sensor savings in lens complexity.   My 5-element C/Y Sonnar 85/2.8 is really sharp wide open, while being really compact and far and away cheaper than the 42.5/1.2 that has an only slightly larger entrance pupil.   If you are willing to manual focus, you can save money even including the cost of a full frame camera just for the short telephotos. You could buy an A7 (or used full frame Canon) and my lens and an adapter for the price of the Panasonic...   That said, in terms of size in your bag (literally) the m43 systems tend to win..."
photography,3dzv1s,Dzeeraajs,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:37:39 2015 UTC,"Eh, I used to agree with the size argument but these days my EM1 kit is at least as bulky as running around with my old D40X (which I guess isn't that big, really, but it's still big compared to, say, the GF1 I started with, or EP3 I moved onto).  It's nice to have the sharpness wide open and the light gathering power of f/1.2, but yes, it is a sacrifice in terms of the overarching look desired.  And yeah, the M. Zuiko 12mm f/2.0 is pretty fun! Got one when they first came out, but after many years of abuse (including falling on top of the damn thing) mine has gotten pretty soft and either needs to be serviced something major or just outright replaced.  :p"
photography,3dytq7,hopewings,11,Mon Jul 20 17:17:33 2015 UTC,The only lenses with a higher dxo overall score are the 55 and 85 Otis and the 55FE. Pretty impressive. I'm still waiting to decide between this and the Batis 85. I've never done macro and have no need to but if this lens can produce some nice portrait shots then it's for me. Hopefully someone does some kind of shootout between the two once they're both widely available to compare actual photos.
photography,3dytq7,BobbyDash,11,Mon Jul 20 17:53:32 2015 UTC,"It's definitely heavier than the Batis 85.   Autofocus speed on macro lenses is often slower than other lenses of comparable focal length, i.e. the helicoid is geared for focusing precision at the expense of focusing speed.  Not saying you shouldn't, just a couple of tradeoffs that macro lenses often have."
photography,3dytq7,anonymoooooooose,4,Mon Jul 20 19:10:36 2015 UTC,"Ah, I didn't consider AF. Thanks for the input."
photography,3dytq7,BobbyDash,2,Mon Jul 20 19:18:10 2015 UTC,Pretty much this; I went with the Rokinon macro and put in my preorder for the Batis...I wanted that quick autofocus and a lighter lens.
photography,3dytq7,McClure_Esq,2,Mon Jul 20 20:46:09 2015 UTC,That Rokinon macro looks quite nice. How has it performed?
photography,3dytq7,ShallowDOF,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:11:03 2015 UTC,"So far I love it.  The lens has some diffraction and focus breathing issues, but I've gotten around those with a newly acquired macro rail.  Here're a few samples: https://flickr.com/photos/64882170@N04/sets/72157653281019002  I've tried taking a few portraits of my 1 year old, but without autofocus it's nearly impossible.  I'll also say that the focus range limiter on the 90mm would be nice, as switching the Rokinon from near to far misses a lot of shots.    TLDR: great macro lens, so-so portrait and tele-lens."
photography,3dytq7,McClure_Esq,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:35:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks. Those macro shots are nice. Just curious, what troubles did you have with manual focus for portraits? Was it due to the 1 year old not sitting still? I just took some shots of my friend's 1 year old smashing her birthday cake with my Nikon 85 f1.8 and, thanks to focus peeking, got a number of sharp images."
photography,3dytq7,ShallowDOF,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:03:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he started walking a few months ago and is constantly in motion...not too bad outside, but not as nice as say continuous AF would be.  FWIW, I also have an old Nikkor AI-S 105mm that I absolutely love, it's lighter and seems that be easier to focus manually, even at low apertures."
photography,3dytq7,McClure_Esq,6,Tue Jul 21 03:58:56 2015 UTC,Or get the Batis 85 and just grab a cheaper macro lens.
photography,3dytq7,metarugia,2,Mon Jul 20 18:19:49 2015 UTC,"But if the 90 performs better technically and looks just as nice, if not close in terms of character, bokeh, etc., may as well just buy the 90. The oled seems cool and it has a zeiss badge but I don't think that elevates it above a Sony G lens if they perform similarly."
photography,3dytq7,BobbyDash,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:41:43 2015 UTC,Oh completely valid. Waiting for both to be available to see what the reviews say. Also waiting on the a7Rii to launch so i can grab a used a7ii to supplement (or replace) my a6000.
photography,3dytq7,metarugia,4,Mon Jul 20 20:45:27 2015 UTC,If portraits are what you're after the Batis would be a better lens IMO.

photography,3dytq7,jannne,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:02:38 2015 UTC,"The close focus of the 85 is enough to fill the frame almost completely with a person's face when I played with it. Not sure what the official minimum distance was stated to be, but it seemed sufficient."
photography,3dytq7,ShallowDOF,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:13:09 2015 UTC,I have pre-ordered the 85 but since it's delayed till mid august and I want/need a portrait lens I'm debating just picking up the 90. Tough call for sure.
photography,3dytq7,johnny5ive,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:54:19 2015 UTC,I'm in the same boat. I handled the Batis 85 at an event and it was pretty damn nice. I'm saving for either that or this 90mm macro. Hoping some find their way to the used market around christmas.

photography,3dytq7,Raichu93,-1,Mon Jul 20 19:21:06 2015 UTC,I don't really subscribe to DXO's scoring because it's just a random number. It's like comparing a Golf GTI and a Ford Focus ST and saying the GTI gets an 87 and the ST only gets a 79. I almost always look for photographers who have taken pictures with the lens and look for pros and cons there.
photography,3dytq7,Slev23,8,Mon Jul 20 21:46:11 2015 UTC,"They condense in a single number a weighted score of several factors. There is plenty of detail available behind those numbers though, so if you care most about distortion, resolution, etc you can go and look at those numbers instead."

photography,3dzi3n,interior-space,3,Tue Jul 21 15:07:05 2015 UTC,Love mine. A flawed classic. Bur still a classic IMHO. A lovely object. But slow and essentially broken with the highly regarded Xf56.
photography,3e00yw,clearvanity,6,Mon Jul 20 22:24:03 2015 UTC,"Honestly you'll get great images on both. It's just personal preference at some point, the deciding factor for me was that Fujifilm's software has been constantly updated. I've had my X-T1 for over a year now and it's been updated with the same features as the XT-10 that has come out nearly 16 months later. Not to many companies do that."
photography,3e00yw,Keenan_RIVALS,3,Mon Jul 20 23:34:14 2015 UTC,"Firmware support on the Fujis is far superior, IMHO. How many new features has Olympus added to the EM10 since early 2014? Um, they got some image stabilization updates and a lens compatibility update. The X-T1 has gotten new image filters, electronic shutter improvements, new auto-focus modes/speed and a whole lot more. Not forgetting all the firmware updates for the lenses. They even updated the X-E1 recently as December 2014. The X-E1 came out in 2012.  Granted, the OMDE10 is a great camera out of the box. Maybe it doesn't need any improvement or new features? Maybe the X-T1 was an incomplete system when released? Whatever your viewpoint, I appreciate a company that keeps reminding customers their aging equipment still has new tricks up its sleeve.   The X-T10 being the newest of the interchangeable lens cameras should see improvements and new features for years to come."
photography,3e00yw,jselene,2,Tue Jul 21 01:42:20 2015 UTC,"The X-T1 and EM-10 aren't even really comparable.  A lot of people would argue the X-T1 needed updates and the E-M5 Mk II hasn't... Autofocus is fast enough out of the box, it has plenty of ""art"" modes already, in-camera filters are fluff and the image stabilization isn't even comparable to the X-T1, the 5-axis is amazing.  Two different cameras anyway OP, X-T10 will replace your DSLR, the OM-D will accompany it. IQ is good enough on both, are you pixel-peeping or taking photos? Larger lens selection for M4/3, also better video-capable cameras in that range if that's something you're interested in.  Tones and dynamic range in the Fuji are better, AF is acceptable and if you're shooting portraits, landscapes etc, you won't be disappointed."
photography,3e00yw,phluxphoto,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:21:20 2015 UTC,Would you with a shorter budget go for the x-t10 over the x-t1?
photography,3e00yw,leorolim,2,Tue Jul 21 10:39:31 2015 UTC,Yes I would. To me it's practically the same camera as far as image quality is concerned.
photography,3e00yw,Keenan_RIVALS,13,Tue Jul 21 12:26:02 2015 UTC,"People will tell you that the Olympus isn't good enough. It's bull. The OMD EM10 is just as good as color film has ever been, ever, and color film was successful for professional photography. At most, you'd have to plan to buy lenses 1 stop faster than APS-C to get similar or better image quality. This means that the lens that's acceptable for others at f4, you're going to want at f3.5 or f2.8.  This will not be a problem given the current lineup of lenses you can adapt or use from Panasonic, Olympus, etc.  So, get whichever feels better to you. You're going to want to go somewhere you can handle them.  And do keep in mind that f2.8 and ISO 800 was enough for many, many years. If you don't shoot in pitch darkness, you should be able to get many nice shots with either camera.   Personally, I prefer the Olympus, because of the larger lens selection, availability of used lenses on KEH, etc.  Once you've used the Olympus 7-14mm 4/3rds on micro four thirds with an adapter, you will swear you've never used a better wide angle. It's rectilinear at 7mm. It's insane. And the 35-100 F2 will blow your brain."
photography,3e00yw,Anonnymush,4,Mon Jul 20 23:20:19 2015 UTC,Is this really advice for someone going for a first camera?
photography,3e00yw,afcanonymous,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:24:41 2015 UTC,"Well, yes. The point is to find a camera that suits your needs, so you aren't trapped in continuous upgrade cycles of gear acquisition, and my point is that both the Olympus and the Fuji are absolutely fine for a beginner through intermediate."
photography,3e00yw,Anonnymush,2,Tue Jul 21 21:04:17 2015 UTC,"At most, you'd have to plan to buy lenses 1 stop faster than APS-C to get similar or better image quality. This means that the lens that's acceptable for others at f4, you're going to want at f3.5 or f2.8.  better image quality   Never heard or read that the aperture has any direct correlation to image quality, other than it takes in more light. Depth of Field, however, is different between say 2.8 on an APS-C camera and a m43 camera. DOF will be shallower on the APS-C camera, given the same max aperture. Other than that, they let in the same amount of light. I think a m43 f/1.8 lens roughly has the same DOF as a f/2.8 on an APS-C camera.  Was this what you meant? Or am I wrong?  Edit: words too many"
photography,3e00yw,Dynafat_norseman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:56:49 2015 UTC,"Sensor size does have an effect on noise and image quality at high ISO though, so I think they were saying Fuji APS-C @ 6400 = Olympus M4/3 @ 3200. And in that case you'd want a wider aperture to keep the ISO down"
photography,3e00yw,_quicksand,2,Tue Jul 21 01:34:47 2015 UTC,"Yes, I see your point."
photography,3e00yw,Dynafat_norseman,5,Tue Jul 21 01:40:22 2015 UTC,"Micro four thirds sensors generally have slightly lower sensitivity due to the smaller pixels. This means you must set ISO  about one stop slower, which necessitates one stop larger aperture for the same signal to noise ratio. I ignore the shutter speed portion, assuming that shutter speed's  effect on motion is not adjustable as an image quality parameter."
photography,3e00yw,Anonnymush,7,Tue Jul 21 03:19:15 2015 UTC,"Hold both in your hands, use them.  I've used M43 and Fujifilm quite a bit and I prefer Fujifilm. Again that's just preference and there are many happy M43 users.  My reasons is mostly due to the rendering. I simply like the interpretation of tones, colours, highlights, shadows etc.  Also grain, dynamic range and the shutter sound."
photography,3e00yw,kjoro,8,Mon Jul 20 23:29:25 2015 UTC,"Play with each and see which feels better. Then think about which system would suit you better.   Fuji has a larger sensor, so somewhat better image quality and larger, more expensive lenses. M4/3 has more lens selection and smaller lenses, but the image quality isn't quite as good, especially at high ISOs."
photography,3e00yw,PutBjorkOnYourSpork,4,Mon Jul 20 23:09:13 2015 UTC,"The image stabilization in the OMD bodies is the best in the business, even the 3-axis in the e-m10. You can use a slower shutter speed at lower ISO, provided your subject isn't moving fast. I have an X100s and an e-m10, and my Olympus is much better in low light situations due to the image stabilization that works with any lens. Fuji has some excellent, excellent lenses. But they are expensive. Micro 4/3 has great lenses too, and there are a lot to choose from, with a lot of bang for the buck.  My only complaint about the Olympus is the menu system is overly complex. You can set the camera up how you want, it's just aggravating to do so. Fuji's firmware is much more user friendly. Once you get it set up, the Olympus is very easy to use with the touchscreen controls."
photography,3e00yw,Thud,2,Tue Jul 21 02:27:33 2015 UTC,"Good news: You won't go wrong with either.  Bad news: Each option has benefits the other can't match, so there're pros and cons for both.  I shoot Micro 4/3. I've found I really like shooting adapted lenses. If I switched, I'd find I'd miss:   In-body image stabilization. It's so useful for focusing manual lenses. Small prime lenses. Micro 4/3 has some really compact glass.   That's the only obvious stuff. Having never really shot Fuji, I don't know what I'd miss going the other direction. Probably ISO performance, dynamic range, build quality (guessing?), and mayyybe even those film simulation modes."

Can't comment on the Oly other than to say I haven't regretted my choice one bit, and am going all-in w/ Fuji.  FWIW, I shot a Canon 60D for ~5 yrs."
photography,3e00yw,cacahootie,2,Tue Jul 21 00:08:50 2015 UTC,How's the AF on the Fujifilm?
photography,3e00yw,Dynafat_norseman,2,Tue Jul 21 00:58:47 2015 UTC,"Better with every firmware update, and they keep rolling them out even for older models. Since they added on sensor phase detection (X-E2, X-T1, X-T10) I think that's helped a lot too."
photography,3e00yw,_quicksand,3,Tue Jul 21 01:39:27 2015 UTC,"It's on par with the Canon 60D that I had for quite some time.  I shoot landscape and such, so I'm not really concerned with the speed so much as just getting focus in a reasonable manner.  It does seem to have more trouble with clouds and the like than my Canon did, but that's the only thing I really noticed.  As far as focusing as a whole, it's great with the focus assist, but I feel like with the clutched lenses getting the AF/MF setting you want can be a little convoluted (i.e. MF override).  It seems to me that since it's focus by wire, MF override should be a no-brainer... but there's times I appreciate the fact that I can accidentally bump the focus ring and not affect the focus (i.e. during a panoramic - which I really enjoy, didn't think I would)."
photography,3e00yw,cacahootie,2,Tue Jul 21 13:16:57 2015 UTC,"You can't really go wrong. The used m43 market (unfortunately for me..) is a gold mine of deals usually. I favor the smaller size/weight/package of m43, so I went that route. Since this is your first camera, it'll hard to honestly recommend anything because you probably don't know what you want.  The best answer has already been said, but if you can, feel both of them in hand. Really bad ergonomics to you will destroy any huge advantage one system has over the other. Some find m43 absolutely too small outside the GH line. Some find the GH line too big to enjoy."

photography,3e00yw,JohnAltona,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:53:00 2015 UTC,"Probably in the long run, for a couple of reasons, the Fuji is going to be more expensive.  For one, there are fewer lenses available, and fewer off-brand options, and not as many used lenses out there either.  Secondly, just off the top of my head, the fuji lenses are more expensive new in the first place.    However, if there are the right lenses you like, you should be happy to hear that nearly everything Fuji makes is very good!  With a couple of exceptions, they make very high quality, sharp, well built prime and zoom lenses.  Nothing very long, so it's not great for sports, but they are fantastic.  Add to that, the Fuji sensor is bigger and better at pretty much everything it would seem from testing out both (better color, sharpness, low light).  And since the sensor is larger, you get bigger apertures and control over DoF, and bigger lenses and bodies generally speakings.    So I guess the things to weigh are (a) cost, (b) quality, and (c) size/weight.  If you don't mind the cost, limits of lens variety, and the feel of the equipment, i would suggest going with the Fuji all the way.  I like the quality you get from their products, and have never been a particular fan of any m4/3 camera or lens.  While the latest from Olympus has been better, I've just never personally found them as comfortable or easy to use, but these are subjective reasons.    One quick last thing: If you plan on doing bird or sports or basically anything long distance, then go with the Olympus since Fuji can't compete there.  Maybe some day, but they have just two long-ish focal length lenses.    Hope that's helpful!  Sorry if I rambled a bit."
photography,3e00yw,IllegibleLetters,-2,Tue Jul 21 04:37:28 2015 UTC,"I had the original EM5, and switched to Fuji for a bit more than a year, and here's my $0.02: There're pros and cons in both systems, I love the film stimulation of the Fuji, and it does have some great lenses and the lens selection has been growing rapidly in the recent years. The focus is okay, but not great, the x-t10 has a new focusing system which might fix that problem, never tried it myself, so can't speak for that. The Olympus on the other hand has a huge selection of lenses to choose from and they are usually much cheaper than the Fuji ones. Focus speed is unmatched, and you will appreciate the in-body IS. You really can't go wrong with either one; one more thing though, if you're looking at the EM10, maybe just better off get a new EM5 online, I am pretty sure you can still find one from some online vendor; you pay a bit more for better IS and a weather sealed body, and if you don't have vintage/manual lenses, you don't need the focus peeking; and get a eye-fi card if you need the wifi feature."

Even my 6D is starting to collect dust on the focusing screen despite my huge precautions to avoid it.  As far as the sensor, you can clean it yourself, have it professionally cleaned, or just deal with it. Again: It happens.

Setup with wrist strap is very useful when your shooting involves a lot of moving or even running between points in a crowded space or on a rough terrain (like for me at local MTB XC races) where you needs to control camera constantly to not hit with it something or someone, and you can't leave it just bouncing on any neck strap or sling for that reason."

You get weather resistance, an actual penta-prism (both of these canon's use a penta-mirror which is cheaper, less bright, and may not afford full scene coverage), a slew of lens choices, and more. If the flip out screen is a deal breaker, then go with the canons. Having shot from all kinds of angles, you get used to not having a flip screen. I would say I use the view finder much more frequently than live view, so a missing flip screen is not an issue. I don't want to sway you too much, so either read some reviews on the cameras or wait for some canon folks to chime in."
photography,3e0yfy,SunSaffron,6,Tue Jul 21 03:08:05 2015 UTC,"Whole heartedly agree. You won't find any better value than Pentax in the price range you're looking at. The K50 can easily be had for under $300 if you buy used on eBay. K5 is also excellent, an older 2010 camera but was their flagship camera at the time. K30 and K50 were released 2012 and 2013. K5 is about the same price, I got mine for only $230 used.  If you do like a flip out screen, get the Pentax KS-2 which has one. It just came out recently so it's still a bit expensive and out of your $400 budget. To me, I don't find the value of an articulating LCD screen. Just get down and dirty with nature, crawl on your knees if that's what it takes to get the shot.  Weather sealing is important if you're outdoors. Rain, dust, mud or freezing cold temperatures won't be an issue for the Pentax DSLRs. Also, consider the K30. K50 and K30 are practically the same camera, just depends which one you find cheaper.   Also, see if you can grab an 18-135 lens. It's excellent for a kit lens, the wide end is excellent for landscapes, and telephoto end for wildlife and animals. The 18-135 is going to be as expensive as the camera itself so that's something you might have to take into consideration. Otherwise, the 18-55 WR could be fine for general purposes.   Also please note that you need to buy lenses designated the ""WR"" to have the weather resistance. DA* series lenses will also have weather resistance by default.   Weather sealing, 100% coverage pentaprism viewfinders, and two control dials are main reasons why I go for Pentax. These three are pro level features that you won't find in Canikon cameras until their more expensive models. Also, you will get a lot better low light performance than Canon's counterparts at the moment. Two control dials is especially important. Being able to change exposure settings fast is a major advantage instead of having to dig through menus to change settings.   Good luck with your purchase! I would check out PentaxForums.com's marketplace for the cheapest prices. There's a few K5's and K30's on sale there right now. No K50's though."

photography,3e0yfy,bassgazer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:51:52 2015 UTC,"Former Pentax user here. Get the Canon. The Pentax is great but the availability of cheap (used or new) Canon lenses is the dealbreaker. You're buying into a system, not just a camera.  Selling a Canon is also a hell of a lot easier than selling a Pentax, as I my self found out the hard way when I wanted to switch systems."
photography,3e0yfy,sprutkakka,5,Tue Jul 21 08:20:13 2015 UTC,"PentaxForums has a rather large marketplace. You can easily get your equipment sold there, and buy used lenses for cheaper prices then you can get on eBay. Every lens I could ever want is listed on their marketplace, whereas eBay won't have all of them. I think the number of features in the Canon and Pentax are not worth over the system itself. That's just my opinion."
photography,3e0yfy,geekygeekz,-3,Tue Jul 21 10:40:28 2015 UTC,"The Pentaxforums marketplace is the best there is, true. Outside of that, though it gets pretty bad, especially if you live in a part of the world where no one really uses or wants Pentax cameras (like me). As always YMMV. As I said the Pentax is not a bad camera, as long as you take the after market into consideration. Obviously if you don't care for that stuff, then go for the better camera."
photography,3e0yfy,sprutkakka,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:00:28 2015 UTC,"I don't know why you're getting down voted. The 3 major camera marketplaces (B&H, Adorama, KEH) also carry a lot of used Pentax equipment. Yes, the used availability isn't as much compared to Canikon, but it's more than enough for my needs.   Like I need a 50-135 right now, there's 3-5 for sale on PentaxForums, all the big 3 camera marketplaces sell them, B&H has one used, and there's about a dozen or so on eBay. It feels almost more personal like I almost get to personally know the lens before I get it. If I was looking for a Nikkor or Canon lens, there would probably be hundreds and thousands of listings."
photography,3e0yfy,geekygeekz,0,Tue Jul 21 19:34:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, as I said in some areas you'll find a decent market. I live in Europe, however, so paying import duties and VAT for purchases from America doesn't make sense and the market for Pentax gear in Europe is pretty much dead when comparing to the other brands.  Oh, and I had the 50-135mm and it was by far my favorite lens. Too bad the SDM broke on it..."
photography,3e0yfy,sprutkakka,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:38:37 2015 UTC,"True, but there's a decent number of Pentax sellers on PentaxForums that are from Europe as well. But if you're in the US/Canada, Pentax gear is pretty viable and relatively easy to purchase.  The newer SDM lenses are supposedly constructed better and don't break as often. I haven't seen any SDM complaints in these past 2-3 years online. Most of the complaints on forums were made in 2012 or before. And people have mentioned that Ricoh changed the SDM motor to be more durable, so I'm still considering it.   You can convert the 50-135 to screwdrive if you don't mind the loud whirring. I really need silent autofocus, it's essential for what I do. I originally wanted the DA* 16-50 for its autofocus, but then I saw all the SDM failures and I got the Sigma 17-50 instead. I really could use the weather sealing of the DA* though :/"

This is my first pentax camera, so I can not speak out for the k50, but judging by it's specs, it should be a great camera.   Pentax has some great, small lenses. Nearly every one of their lenses is better made than other dslr, and many are weather sealed along with the body.  Some things I don't like about the camera: No tethering into Capture 1 (or lightroom) Lacking fast, wide lenses. I wish Pentax had a 16mm 1.4 like the Fuji"

Since you don't know the students it's hard to gauge what is a normal smile for them or what is fake and what they think is a good look or bad look. Often times a single pose will have several identical pictures so I pick one. But because there are differences in many I will upload small unedited examples and ask them to pick the ones they like. I don't do heavy editing on senior pics so those are close to the final product.

From the artist's website:  NHDK - Description  NHDK project is an attempt of the artist in order to extract not only images but also a video from his production workflow.  I this case, the resulting video is an accelerated slideshow of 88 variants of one same picture, each of them associated with piano key, which in fact are 88 in total.  The decision of mixing 3d imagery with an instrument such as a piano comes mainly from the fact that the artist feels very nostalgic of that instrument just because he used to play it when he was younger; but due to other life choices he had to give it up.  In the other hand, setting a precise number of images to do would offer this project the chance to experiment some limits, something quite important when it’s time to be clear and specific, and not fall into vagueness.  The whole project was done in 8 months, of which the first 6 and half were used to build the 3d scenario and the last 1 and a half to improvise in the resulting 88 images."

photography,3e14g8,reigningnovice,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:46:38 2015 UTC,"could you guys give me a rundown about things you tweak after adjusting aperature, iso, shutter speed etc.   The light and the subject. I shoot architecture and food mostly, but I've been accepting product gigs lately which is a nice change. But in every instance, I don't even really think much about camera settings, I spend most of my time tweaking the light and the subject.  In the case of architecture (mostly interiors), the ISO and aperture rarely change. 200 ISO, F7.1-F11. The only thing I change in each space is shutter speed, based on ambient light, and I adjust it a few times for exposures of various levels. But where I spend most of my time is adjusting furniture, tweaking the camera position, shifting the lens with perspective control, etc. I'll take many ambient shots until I get the layout and base exposure that I want, then I'll take another 20-30 photos with a handheld flash walking around the frame and illuminating different parts of the subject.  Food is similar. Use a stand-in, get the base exposure set in camera, then tweak the subject, the light, and reflectors. This alone can take a half an hour or more. Then when the light is perfect, call for the hero to replace the stand-in dish.  Today, I shot watches for a newish brand based in LA. I didn't touch shutter speed or ISO, and the only reason I adjusted apertures was because I wanted an optionally crisp background or a blurred version.  Normally, I wouldn't touch these settings. The one exposure variable I would touch is the power settings on my strobes. Once that was done, another half and hour setting up a bunch of reflectors to give an even reflection in the steel case of the watch, then using handheld reflectors in various positions one shot at a time. I can then blend these together in post to build out the final image that I want.  For most of what I shoot, camera settings are a momentary, instinctual part of the process. Adjusting the subject and the light are where I spend hours of my time every single day."

Don't skim anything. If there is anything you don't understand then google it.  Afterwards if you still encounter stuff you don't understand or forgot go back and read that part of the manual again.  I could tell you about all settings I worry about but they're different from thethinktank because we don't shoot the same subjects, and they might be different from what you shoot. And even if we shoot the same we might not have the same camera so a lot of it might be moot."
photography,3e14g8,SovietK,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:54:35 2015 UTC,"Your 1Dx is more than enough to get professional shots when paired up with good lens and light.   Spend a few nights with your manual. Find out what all those buttons do and experiment. Once you really get the settings and every part of your camera ingrained in your brain, camera settings become second nature and you start thinking more about the picture itself.   It's like when I first started driving, all I could focus on was how fast I was going, making sure I as in the middle of the lane, constantly checking my mirrors, making sure I don't mix up the gas and brake pedals. Then after a while, it becomes more natural and you can do stuff like change the radio station, turn the AC on, etc.   A camera is similar, just keep shooting. Find some inspiration online, browse Flickr and 500px."

I can't really imagine what kind of lens distortion would warp an image like that without also totally fucking the image quality at the same time.  It could be a software problem too: Did you do Lightroom upright adjustments and then do a sync-settings with everything selected across multiple photos? If you did that then the wrong corrections could be getting applied to the other images, and that could easily warp the heck out of the image."

Nobody knows what you shoot or how you shoot it, so you should really consider that when choosing a lens. Are you doing travel photography? If so, the 40-150 is probably too long.

photography,3e01co,Throwamay_,21,Mon Jul 20 22:26:45 2015 UTC,"Slow down there killer.  Presumably you're talking about Olympus digital cameras, they're 4/3rds sensors, so the crop multiplier is 2x.  You don't need to know what that means, what you need to understand is that for olympus lenses, double their listed focal length to give you the 35m equivalent focal length.  In other words, the Olympus 25mm lens is equivalent to a 50mm lens in terms of focal length.  You could put a 50mm lens on an old 35mm film camera, put the 25mm on an OMD EM-5, stand in the same spot and your frame will look the same.  The Olympus 17mm lens is equivalent to a 35mm lens (well, 34mm, but close enough).  The 45mm you're eyeing up is a 90mm lens, or a shortish telephoto, great for portraiture."

photography,3e01co,av4rice,8,Tue Jul 21 09:20:54 2015 UTC,"50mm is a ""normal"" focal length and typical for general use on full frame 135 format film/sensors.  35mm is moderately wide on full frame, and is also used on APS-C format sensors to approximate that normal field of view that 50mm has on full frame (35mm x a 1.5x APS-C crop factor is 52.5mm). On APS-C, 50mm is more of a medium-telephoto for portraits.  Olympus digital cameras use a smaller 4/3"" format, with a crop factor of 2x. So 25mm on your format gives you that normal field of view of 50mm on full frame (25mm x 2 = 50mm). If you want a moderately wide prime you're looking for something like 17mm. 45mm for you would be like a medium-telephoto for portraits."

It's close to the length of the diagonal. Once upon a time the kit lens for 35mm SLRs was a 50mm prime.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_lens#Film_still  35mm lenses were fairly common on that format as well, but they were considered moderately wide and generally had to use a retrofocal design.   now the norm of a 50mm is price on digital its a lens that can be purchased for about 125 bucks. while its standard 35mm is about 3x the price.   That might be true for Canon, but Nikon's 35mm is the cheap one in their lineup.  At any rate, price isn't what defines a normal lens. And part of the reason 50mm lenses are cheap today is because they have the benefit of simple design (i.e., not retrofocal) and popularity from the film era."

photography,3dxwb5,ender323,5,Mon Jul 20 14:22:31 2015 UTC,"A lot of the old 50mm primes are great and cheap. Your best bet (IMHO) is to get a really nice adapter and stick to one lens platform for now, rather than get really cheap adapters and get multiple different lens mounts. Canon FD could be a good place to start, because after they created the EF mount there aren't really any cameras using the FD anymore. Nikon F mount is still compatible with their newest cameras so prices are higher."
photography,3dxwb5,NoDogNo,2,Mon Jul 20 14:32:11 2015 UTC,Fun bonus: if you eventually spring for a speedbooster-type adapter (they're much more expensive but increase the effective aperture and retain something close to full frame field of view) you can also use it for newer manual lenses.

photography,3dxwb5,DatAperture,4,Mon Jul 20 15:08:36 2015 UTC,"Canon has traditionally been the system I think of when I think ""compromise between photo and video,"" so I'll recommend them.  Also this is a tough question because there's not a whole lot to set the t3i and t5i apart. the t5i has faster autofocus/burst rate, a touch screen, and (very slow) video autofocus. If you're just shooting nature and landscapes (non-moving) and making vlogs (stationary) then the t3i is fine. If you shoot action and want to do some amateur filmmaking, the touch-to-focus might be nice to have on the t5i. Since I'm not a video expert I'd recommend you check out /r/videography and see if there are pre-existing threads on this."

photography,3dxwb5,dotMJEG,3,Mon Jul 20 16:35:35 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say that. You technically don't need IS at any focal length, it just helps.   The IS will let you stop down your shutter speed so you can hand hold at very low shutter speeds.  It's also great for video, and 35mm is a common video focal length so imagine that played a part.   It's not what makes it 4x the price though, it's everything from the construction to the optical setup to the glass used and coatings applied to the glass.    Why don't they make a $150 35mm   Demand. They have cheap lenses from the 50 1.8, to the 24 2.8 STM pancake and the 40mm STM 2.8. It wouldn't make much sense to have a cheapo 35mm (or at least to focus on R&D for such) when there is demand for a nice 35mm f/2 IS, and the next step up being the L series 35.  Lenses aren't cheap, ultimately."
photography,3dxwb5,benfires,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:34:20 2015 UTC,"A 50mm lens is cheap because it requires the least amount of work and tinkering to get it right. The fact that it's a 50mm also reduces the amount of distortion the images suffer.  If you're comparing a 35 and 50 spec for spec, a 35mm lens is more expensive because it requires more glass elements. The 35mm focal length is also infamous for horrendous distortion, especially when you stack it against any nifty fifty. Canon could churn a cheap 35 out for full frame but it will probably be utter rubbish in terms of optical performance, which results in pretty much nothing but losses for them. Nikon 1-upping this with a crop sensor 35mm lens is a definite worthy mention though, and many canon users have been asking why canon hasn't done the same."

photography,3dxwb5,dotMJEG,6,Mon Jul 20 13:43:09 2015 UTC,"… on what?   What are you shooting? Tricks and tips are generally used to achieve a specific effect or result, without knowing what you are shooting it's hard to give advice. For instance, shutter-dragging is great at events or with rapidly moving subjects, but not as useful as night portraits or urbex interiors.   High ISO and flash will often mean that you can include a lot of the background/ ambient light while using less flash for more of a balanced exposure, OR that you can get a really large depth of field because you can stop your aperture way down and still have adequate light from the flash."
photography,3dxwb5,anon1821,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:50:27 2015 UTC,Thanks for replying....  I'm usually shooting portraits indoors and outdoors using high shutter speeds (at night obviously) (using sony a58 with the kit lens at max tele @55mm/f 5.6)  During daylight i only use the flash for fill in when the sun is behind the subject  PS I'm shooting familly events nothing fancy or proffesional nature involved
photography,3dxwb5,dotMJEG,4,Mon Jul 20 13:55:14 2015 UTC,"Shutter dragging, a wide-field astrophoto-portrait shot would be relevant. Otherwise I'd say if you can, stop down the ISO when it isn't necessary unless that tis the look you are going for.  That and a really well exposed background while still freezing the subject in photo due to increased light sensitivity."
photography,3dxwb5,anon1821,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:01:30 2015 UTC,Thanks for the astro photo portrait idea and using the wide angle i can get down to f3.5 on my lens(but losing some depth of field :))  For a posed and not candid portrait sort of speak i can dial down the shutter to 1/60 so i guess i dont need that fast shutter and having to up the iso subsequently
photography,3dxwb5,dotMJEG,4,Mon Jul 20 14:04:53 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind how shutter speed and aperture effect the light received differently. Shutter speed will have a visible effect on how much the ambient/ continuous lighting adds to exposure, and aperture will control how much flash effects exposure.   Obviously they both will influence the total exposure of all light, but they more directly modify ambient and flash exposure respectively, to a greater extent.   It's easier to demonstrate than explain. But ISO can be used here to add a balancing number to the mix, like if you wanted more ambient light exposure but didn't want to alter the flash settings or you want to freeze motion but want less ambient light, up shutter speed, lower ISO, and alter flash accordingly, and the like. Make sense?"

Look up photographs of photographers you really like and try to recreate them.  Study the history of photography.

photography,3dxwb5,TheFunkwich,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:05:45 2015 UTC,"snapsort.com is a good place to start, all it really tells you is amoutn of lenses available...  I can tell you that m43 will probably be the cheapest (with some, but not complete confidence) as it doesnt have the older manaul lens support like sony/nikon. But in terms of new lenses vs quality, it will win out ( with the standard trade offs of course)  Though, I think you have a bigger situation on your hands as you don't really know what kind of camera/ system you want.  Those are all vastly different bodies  with different sensor sizes, feels and controls. I suggest you narrow that down first (maybe a budget would be good)  if youre deciding based on lenses and lest say you shoot portraits, look at which will produce the best skin tones? (i believe fuji  is often praised for that) Then look at the lenses on their system that would fit your style of shooting while, and then look to other systems and see what lenses that fit your style would cost"
photography,3dxwb5,nuke691,2,Mon Jul 20 19:59:53 2015 UTC,"Hey everyone, I'm a hobbyist and am seeking to buy a new DSLR in the next week and have been doing a lot of research but I'm still faced with a lot of options.   Some things about me:  -I've been shooting film for a year now on my dad's old Nikon FE  -I have two old Nikon lenses  -Budget is between $600-$1,500  -I shoot mainly landscapes, macro shots, cars, portraits, and astrophotography  -Wi-Fi and GPS are important features for me (Wi-Fi more so than GPS)  For the past week I thought I was locked into my decision of getting a Nikon APS-C camera like the D7100 ($899.99) but then my dad said he would give me $500 for the camera, so now my budget is expanded to $1,500-ish, which allows my budget to include full-frame cameras. This leads me to my first question: why should I get an APS-C sensor camera if my budget can afford a full-frame one, and when in the future I will be seeking to upgrade to a full-frame camera?   I was locked into Nikon earlier because of the two Nikon lenses I already have for my film camera, but after going into Best Buy today to see if they would work with the DSLRs, they work, but only with manual focus. Second question: While that is fine, I do not think that is a reason to lock me into the Nikon brand, because buying a lens adapter for a Canon would give me the same capabilities for my lenses as a Nikon, right?   When buying a camera, how do you compare image quality between various models (within a brand and against another brand) I have seen websites such as DXOmark, but when compared to other websites, I feel as though they shit on Canon and don't give them as good reviews as other websites for some reason, any insight on this? Is Nikon really the better camera in regard to the sensor, as DXOmark suggests?  When the specs of the camera say that the ISO is expandable, what does that mean?  Is it appropriate to base a decision to buy a thousand dollar camera on a feature such as Wi-Fi and GPS built in?   Any advice would be appreciated! If you were in a similar situation like mine in choices for cameras below, please give me your insight! Thanks!  Full Frame: Nikon: D610, D750  Canon: 6D  APS-C: Nikon: D5500, D5300, D7200  Canon: 70D  Here is a chart I made that broke down the choices I'm looking at  For some reason I feel as though the rebel T6i and T6s aren't as good as the others I've mentioned, so I left them out."

My current lens arsenal:    Canon 18-55 f/3.5-5.6 IS (ie the kit lens)  Sigma 70-300mm f4-5.6 dg macro  Asahi Pentax Super-Takumar 55 f/1.8  Asahi Pentax Super-Takumar 28 f/3.5   I'm shooting on a T2i and I'm not looking to upgrade the body right now.  I'm wondering if it's time to upgrade the kit lens. I use the primes a fair bit but there are certainly times where I pick the kit lens for convenience.  I would like to have a lens with some zoom and half decent auto focus. Low light is a lower priority.  I was looking at a Canon 24-85 f/3.5-4.5 USM which I could pick up pretty heavily used for 80$  Budget caps out at about $150-200. Amazon or Keh are my preferred vendors.  Any suggestions? Thanks!
photography,3dxwb5,DatAperture,2,Mon Jul 20 14:35:14 2015 UTC,"I would keep the kit lens. The 24-85 is an old zoom designed for full-frame cameras and is not really any better or worse than the kit lens, so it's not really an upgrade. The upgrades worth buying start around $400, imo."

The best upgrade for you would be the ""Tamron 17-50mm f/2.8 lens for Canon"", which is a good lens to upgrade from the Canon kit lens.  It's fairly cheap, and could be found on ebay for around $200 used. Just go on ebay and search ""tamron 17 50 canon"", sort by price, and set it to around $100-250."

I have the 40 and the 50 and both are fantastic lenses for portraits and outdoors work where you have some room to work. They're both fantastically sharp; the 40/2.8 is nicely sharp right at 2.8, the 50/1.8 gets sharper around that same point (although 1.8 and 2.0 aren't bad).  If you're shooting indoors, the 24mm is probably gonna be more useful, because in a typical dining room or living room (think christmas time, family party) scenario, 50mm and even 40mm are gonna be way too tight.   For $100-$150, you're not going to get anything better, especially not a zoom."

(easy) b&w conversion. learn how to use different color filters to get the image you want. ditch the filters and presets. (easy) curves for tonality. fine-tune those levels. (medium) HSL adjustments for color. (medium) RGB curves for fine color adjustments (harder) sharpening. this is easy if you use certain standard rules of thumb. there are also entire multi-hour tutorials on sharpening, then this gets more involved. color profiles and lens adjustments. most of this is pretty straightforward until you calibrate your monitor, which is a little more involved and a lot more expensive. perspective and distortion correction beyond automatic. play around with it. but if you do stuff like architecture and interiors this is something that becomes a lot more involved and forces difficult decisions because corrections have trade-offs."

I'm kind of pissed that I 'wasted' so many good photo ops from that trip but I guess there's nothing to do but learn and practice more! I'm in love with this bw shot of a duck for reasons I can't explain. Did I go overboard with the editing though?  I've always liked photography but it's an expensive hobby so I never really got into it but now I'm already thinking about getting an EF 50mm STM. I understand that with my 1.6x crop factor, I'll effectively have an 80mm focal length which is recommended for portraits and street photography. Is my kit EFS 18-55mm lens equivalent to a 28.8-99mm lens on a full frame camera too or did Canon already adjust it since it's an EFS lens built for APS-C cameras?  How much better are the current gen (eg Nikon D3300) compared to my EOS 500? Would it be worthwhile to trade in my EOS 500 for ~100 USD and pay the extra ~300 USD to upgrade?"

So your 18 is 28.8, or whatever the exact product is.  Landscape shot: at 28mm, everything from about 2 meters to infinity is in focus at f8. lenses tend to have sweet spots for sharpness in the middle of the aperture range. this is why lenses that are sharp wide open are so impressive and so expensive, and also why, unless there is a prominent foreground element, people are reluctant to stop down to f22. it's a nice shot. i would consider how it would have looked if you had moved a bit to the right and maybe gotten low.

Every 6 months or so, I look back and think ""damn, if I had just known then what I know now, I could have gotten such better photos...""   Did I go overboard with the editing though?   I don't think so.   Is my kit EFS 18-55mm lens equivalent to a 28.8-99mm lens on a full frame camera too or did Canon already adjust it since it's an EFS lens built for APS-C cameras?   50mm is 50mm, whether it's a lens for full frame or for crop. 50mm on your kit lens is the same field of view you'd get from a 50mm STM.   How much better are the current gen (eg Nikon D3300) compared to my EOS 500? Would it be worthwhile to trade in my EOS 500 for ~100 USD and pay the extra ~300 USD to upgrade?   They're mainly better in low light. In good light, there's not a lot of set them apart. Definitely don't upgrade until you know what you're doing, or you'll be the one bottlenecking your camera."

I fine tune the actual dodge/burn by hitting x while in Photoshop to go to black and then refine the white edges painted earlier, then working the curve and the layer opacity.

photography,3dxwb5,DatAperture,2,Mon Jul 20 16:53:09 2015 UTC,"My recommendation would be not to bring the 75-300, because the quality is awful and it takes up too much space and weight. Most travel photography is taken at wider focal lengths (landscapes, people, architecture, street...telephoto zoom not needed), but if you do think you'll need some reach (maybe you're going to want bird pictures in India or something?) then replace it with the Canon 55-250 STM.  If you want an ultrawide because you think you'll be doing a lot of landscapes and architecture, get the canon 10-18 STM.

photography,3dxwb5,DatAperture,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:53:24 2015 UTC,"I would think that in AV, setting a higher ISO would force the camera to use a faster shutter speed.  As for the actual quality, in good light there's not a huge difference between ISO 100, 200, or 400 on modern cameras. 800 might show a tad bit of noise if you look really hard."

photography,3dxwb5,capt_0bvious,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:11:37 2015 UTC,"let's look at this picture, could they have used iso 100?"
photography,3dxwb5,r_golan_trevize,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:19:16 2015 UTC,"The exif says ISO 200 which may actually probably be base ISO for a Rebel. A lot of crop cameras started out at 200.  However, if it could be set to ISO 100 then they could've cut the shutter speed to 1/250 and gotten the same shot and with probably a 35mm lens (52mm after crop factor) they would've safely been above the danger zone for hand holding. So, yes."
photography,3dxwb5,dotMJEG,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:32:49 2015 UTC,"Some don't pay attention to it. Some use AutoISO. Some need a specific ISO based up constraints placed on other settings like shutter speed (moving subjects, camera shake, and/or long telephoto lenses) or constrained aperture requirements (like a desired short or deep Depth of field)"
photography,3dxwb5,DatAperture,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:18:05 2015 UTC,"I don't see it as high ISO causing the noise. I see noise as the result of a weak signal reaching the camera. Here's a simplified way to look at it:  Imagine it's pitch black, midnight, no light but the stars. Do a 2 minute exposure at ISO 100. It's going to be noisy. Why? The signal reaching the camera is so weak that the camera can't really tell what color you're seeing, so it sort of makes its best guess. Voila, image noise.  Now imagine you're shooting sports on a bright afternoon. To make sure there's no motion blur, you're shooting at 1/2000 sec. This might require you to shoot ISO 800 or 1600. But the signal reaching your camera is extremely strong, from all the sunlight. I bet you'll barely see any noise at all.  For this reason, an ISO 100 photo at night might look noisier than an ISO 3200 photo during the day.  Anyways, you don't need to know all that to get good photos. Just choose the aperture you want for your depth of field, the shutter speed required to freeze the action, and pick the ISO to make it work. Modern cameras produce great high ISO images, so don't think any image above ISO 100 is automatically ruined!"

I've watched a few review videos, but haven't been able to get a sense which will work better for my non-professional use. Besides shooting whatever interests me, I have become the photographer on call for events hosted by my friends around town—dinner parties and whatnot—so I'm curious, how would either of these lenses hold up in low light (if at all)? The kit lens has treated me well but has trouble in those situations.  I have a Canon EOS Rebel SL1 Digital SLR with the kit lens."
photography,3dxwb5,DatAperture,3,Mon Jul 20 17:02:34 2015 UTC,"try sticking your kit lens at 24 and 40mm and shoot a whole day on just those. See which you'd rather be stuck with, then get that one!  f2.8 lets in between .5x-4x more light than your kit lens.

photography,3dxwb5,QuerulousPanda,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:10:13 2015 UTC,"I was just curious how you found it in terms of consistency. A lot of the sample photos from awesometographer and some other reviews I found on the 'net had a very nice overall look and feel to them, with nice colors and decent bokeh and a generally pleasing sorta vibe to them. But... the sharpness at 2.0 and the focus accuracy seemed suspect.  $116 is not a bad price for a cheap and cheerful lens, provided it can do the business, and it would make a nice pair with the 50/1.8 STM I just picked up.  But, if it turns out that it can't focus (i don't care if it's noisy, as long as it hits the point) or that the photos are soft at f2.0, then that's 25-30% of the price of the Canon 35/2.0 IS or Sigma 30/1.4 Art wasted on an expensive lesson."

Whenever I see these types of photos, to me they always look way sharper, brighter, and more detailed than what either I or my camera is capable of.  These are the kinds of pictures I want to take but whenever I try, the results I get could never come close to these types of photos.  I'm sure it requires more practice on my part but I'm also wondering if I need photo editing software.  Are these types of pictures possible with JUST the camera and no editing?

These are the kinds of pictures I want to take but whenever I try, the results I get could never come close to these types of photos.   How do your attempts look? What settings/procedure are you using?   Are these types of pictures possible with JUST the camera and no editing?    You should be able to shoot photos within those categories without post processing, if that's what you're asking. But you generally want to post process to make those photos their best. And your favorite photos from other photographers are most likely post processed.   do they need to be edited in programs like Lightroom?   Do you mean ""like Lightroom"" to just refer to all photo editing programs? Or ""like Lightroom"" in particular in opposition to other photo editing programs? Lightroom is just a solid implementation of essential editing tools with good workflow implementation to link those to library management/organization tools. It's meant to help you get a handle over larger collections of photos and processing them quickly for most needs. I wouldn't say those unique features are particularly essential for the genres you mentioned, but they're helpful for photographers in general. Something more specialized in deep sky stacking (not sure if more recent Lightroom versions or plugins do that now) are something to look into for milky way photography in particular. If you're trying to decide, you should probably identify what you want to get out of it first."

photography,3dxwb5,DatAperture,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:45:40 2015 UTC,"A few tips:   You definitely need editing programs. Lightroom is probably all you need. Photoshop is only necessary for very heavy edits. the more filters you put on, the more fine detail you lose. 4 filters seems excessive to me. Make sure your aperture is at f5.6-11 (probably around 8) for maximum sharpness. You were at f22, which is very high. this, combined with the filters, wrecked your image quality. Long exposures make water and clouds blur, but they also blurred the motion in the reeds. Even more fine detail killed. If it was so bright that you needed f22 and 4 filters...it was too bright. Lesson one of landscapes is don't force it! IF the light is too harsh, it's too harsh. Come back when it isn't!"
photography,3dxwb5,Slip83,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:00:00 2015 UTC,"Okay, thanks so much for the feedback!  Your last point probably explains a lot of the problems then, I put the 4 filters on because anything less overexposed my pictures.  If I were to go back and redo this, is it possible to get a good long exposure over the water with minimal filters?  Do I need to wait until right before sunset? Is shooting a long exposure directly at a sunset a bad idea for getting high quality images?"
photography,3dxwb5,DatAperture,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:14:09 2015 UTC,"All my sunset pictures are regular exposures, so I'm able to shoot f8 with no filters and get ideal sharpness.   One other problem. that shot was taken at 55mm. Higher focal length = more zoomed in = the sun appears larger in the frame. Bigger sun = more brightness. You may want to try shooting more wide angle....it's hard to do long exposures where the sun is in the image because the sun is extremely bright and pretty much no amount of filters can stop it. If you look around you'll notice a lot of long exposure landscapes have neither the sun nor moon in the shot."

Do you all think this would be an upgrade from the Nikon D5200 (specifically for wildlife photography), even though it's less expensive?"

You have a crop sensor now.   Do you all think this would be an upgrade from the Nikon D5200 (specifically for wildlife photography), even though it's less expensive?   The original MSRP was higher. It's just older now. And I wouldn't say used prices are much different between the two either.  Is there anything in particular you don't like about the D5200? What sort of improvements exactly are you looking for?  With the D300  you'll have a better viewfinder, larger grip, tougher build, second control dial, slightly faster continuous shooting speed, and better autofocus system, at the cost of older sensor technology with about half the pixel count."

I think the problem is mostly with my lens, as I'm not happy with the bokeh and I just need that extra f-stop to get a little more light in.   I should have mentioned that I was also looking at switching as the D5200 does not have an autofocus motor and some of the used lenses I'd like to buy do not have an internal motor. I've been watching a lot of ""What's in My Kit"" videos and it seemed a lot of pros were carrying the D300, so I thought that might be a good option. Do you have any suggestions for another camera that might do well with the 300mm f2.8 I'd like to get? Or am I totally off base here?"
photography,3dxwb5,DatAperture,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:43:09 2015 UTC,"Your d5200 is also a crop sensor, and it has more resolution to boot. A d300 would be an upgrade in ergonomics and handling, but a downgrade in image quality. I'd stay on the d5200."

In most situations a FF is not needed. I don't know you aside from that little description so I can't really advise. Your gear is perfectly capable for doing what you're doing and lens or camera upgrades will not make that much of a difference.  Lighting is a 4th option you should consider. I started out with a D7000, 2 kit lenses and a 50 and 35 prime. I upgraded my kit to a tamron 17-50mm and then bought a 85 1.4G for portraits and headshots and a 11-16mm for real estate and events.  After that, I spent pretty much all my money on lighting and associated. I invested in the V850 flash system because they are next level speedlights and i use them in place of studio lights (look at the flash havoc review).   I spent money on light stands, 1.35m paper backgrounds, umbrella softboxes, a ton of swivel brackets (phottix varos II BG), multiple types of clamps, poles, reflectors and so on. In my work, control of light and how I shoot are still more important than any camera or lens upgrade.      I highly recommend getting 2 good camera bags as well, and a solid lighting bag/case if you have stands and stuff. One for basic shoots like events and a bigger one that can hold and protect a good amount of gear. I use a crumpler 7MDH and lowepro classified 160AW for less gear and a crumpler 8MDH for lots of gear (space for tablet, A4 notebook and other stuff).  You should already have 2 backup SD cards and you could upgrade to a pelican 0915 card case. Backup battery in a small neoprene pouch. Good lens cloth in each bag you use. Hood for each lens if you don't have one already.  Spend a hundred or so to get good business cards printed, something basic with your contact info. Print on the thickest card you can get, usually around 350gsm. Don't go below 300gsm. Matte celloglaze will make them 'feel more professional' than uncoated stock.   Get your own domain name too if you have figured what you want to use, get a basic site setup and put your work up there. Connect your domain name email address to your gmail account so you look more professional instead of using a @gmail domain (this is where contact@yourname.com redirects to your gmail account)."

photography,3dxwb5,RMSEP,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:54:45 2015 UTC,"Hi all, I've recently started exploring photography. I've learned the 3 variables that control exposure:   aperture (ie, the opening of the lens) shutter speed (ie, the time the sensor is exposed) ISO (the sensitivity of the sensor to light)   Control of each is prioritized by my cameras 'A' and 'S' modes and the ISO button. As in any camera, there's also a 'Scene' button, which is a predescribed setting for a given environment.   My question is, how are these 'scenes' defined. Is each a specific constellation of Aperture, Shutter Speed and ISO? Or are there other variables that are encoded into the scene definition?"
photography,3dxwb5,koeb,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:01:32 2015 UTC,"Besides the mentioned 3 variables, the camera typically applies different settings for generating the jpegs when using the differnt scene modes. For example the colors and contrast for ""Landscape"" should look a little different compared to ""Portait""."
photography,3dxwb5,av4rice,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:01:40 2015 UTC,"Scene modes have their own priorities for what they want to do with aperture and shutter speed. And yes, they could also affect focusing, whether and how flash is used, and post processing of the jpeg."

I had pretty much settled on the D750, but now I'm being tempted by the A7ii. The major benefits of the latter seem to be the size/weight, image stabilization, focus peaking (seems cool). Downsides include native lens selection, possibly autofocus(?) I was doing some research and came across this image comparison. Is this a legit comparison of IQ? It seems really striking.  I shoot mostly food, travel (future trips include Milan and Vietnam), family/kids, and sports (my sister's indoor gymnastics, outdoor diving).  My plan for the D750 was to pick up some primes (something wide, 50, 105 macro) now, and save up for a 24-70, and eventually a 70-200 2.8. My plan for the Sony would be 55, and then I have no idea...  I guess I'm just asking for general input. Any thoughts?"

The photos by the Nikon of the shirt and the pencil exhibit motion blur and the shot of the camera is just out of focus which could have been user error, the lens, or the camera calibration. I own a pair of D750's and can assure you the camera can shoot tack sharp. Not saying the Nikon is a better camera, that would depend on your usage, but the comparison is crap."

photography,3dxwb5,10ofClubs,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:06:08 2015 UTC,"I recently shot with a friend's telephoto lens (I believe 50-300mm), and it had a Macro and Normal switch on it. I have a feeling that the Macro switch just locked it in at the longest range (200-300mm). Is that all it does, or is there anything else going on that I should know about. I only ask because I'm not 100% sure the difference between a telephoto and a Macro specific lens, and this had a switch which further confused me.   Additionally, I'm thinking of getting a prime lens because I'm noticing my kit lens isn't getting good results in low light and it becoming a bit frustrating. I was thinking of getting the 100 dollar canon lens, but wasn't sure if I should go for 50mm or 35 mm because of crop-factor.   Lastly, is there a minimum distance from subject for any given lens to render the subject sharp? I feel like I'm unable to get as close to some subjects as I would like as the camera will either struggle to focus, or say it is in focus but the picture will come out blurry. I have only noticed this on shots for which I was closer to the subject."
photography,3dxwb5,av4rice,2,Tue Jul 21 01:01:46 2015 UTC,"I have a feeling that the Macro switch just locked it in at the longest range (200-300mm). Is that all it does, or is there anything else going on that I should know about.   On my telephoto lens, the macro switch opens up the 1.5-2.5m focusing range for the autofocus motor. So if you know you're shooting stuff far away, you hit the switch to rule out that closer range and the autofocus can work a bit faster.   I'm not 100% sure the difference between a telephoto and a Macro specific lens   Telephoto means a long focal length. Macro means a high reproduction ratio / magnification. A longer focal length contributes to higher magnification, but distance to the subject is important as well. Many telephoto lenses that aren't macro lenses use a long focal length but also don't have a very close minimum focusing distance, so they don't have very good reproduction ratio and aren't good at macro despite the long focal length.   I was thinking of getting the 100 dollar canon lens, but wasn't sure if I should go for 50mm or 35 mm because of crop-factor.   What subject matter will you be shooting with it?  Do you have an 18-55mm lens or some other zoom that already covers 35mm and 50mm? If so, you can check the EXIF data of your favorite shots to see what you might tend to prefer. And you can zoom the lens to 35mm and 50mm and keep it there to try out those fields of view.   Lastly, is there a minimum distance from subject for any given lens to render the subject sharp? I feel like I'm unable to get as close to some subjects as I would like as the camera will either struggle to focus, or say it is in focus but the picture will come out blurry.   Yes, every lens has a minimum focusing distance. It's not really a matter of sharpness so much as it's just impossible for the lens to focus closer than the minimum distance."

I'd like to adapt the lenses to my NEX-7, and while I'm able to find more than enough info about the Bessamatic (DKL-to-E adapter seems like it's what I need), the AkArelle has been more elusive.    It has a Schneider-Kreuznach Xenar lens, 50mm f3.5, and it uses a mount system that I've never seen before. It's like a screw mount, but you line up the lens to the correct position, then tighten the lens to the body using a ring on the lens, almost like the Canon FD breech-lock system. I've attached pictures here. It has a 10-blade aperture, the blades are nice and snappy, and the focusing is smooth, so I'd love to try it on my NEX if possible, I just don't know if there's an adapter out there for it."

The only advantages for 3D printed adapters would be the aesthetics can be designed for a specific camera. Also with less common mounts you could have a go at making your own one as you don't need a machine shop or lathe skills to make metal ones.  I have several King Regula rangefinder lenses that use an oddball mount only used on those cameras and some that Braun had in the 50's and early 60's. Adapters for this to anything else just don't exist as the mount and lenses are pretty rare, also the aperture is controlled on the camera body so i'd need an aperture ring built into the adapter. I'm pretty sure i could learn how to make a 3D printable model for this and have it printed at the 3D printing shop just down the road from me; hmm actually i might try that at some point.  Anyway i think it's a good idea for oddball mounting projects, like adapting rare mounts or even like taking lens from old medium format folders, or fixed lens 35mm cameras and mounting them to modern cameras."

The pockets come in handy on the pants and the shirt will help keep you cool in the sun. Comfy shoes and cushioned socks. Also bring a small bag or pack for stuff you will need to have handy.  Put your phone in airplane mode.

Then if the boss says, ""you didn't have to wear all that today!""  You reply, ""Well, I wasn't sure what your particular dress code was for shoots, but I'd rather err on the side of caution and not show up to one of your jobs and embarrass the company.""

If she opts for DropBox, I strongly suggest that you zip the folder so that she will be forced to download the entire take, and will not assume that a regular folder full of individual photos will remain in your DropBox for her to browse and download individual photos over time.  An acceptable number of photos for a situation like this, for me, would be every photo that doesn't have a technical or compositional flaw. If you have five frames of a group of four, not everybody is going to agree on what the best frame is. Deliver anything where nobody has closed eyes or some otherwise unflattering expression."

photography,3dyeux,tanstaafl90,10,Mon Jul 20 16:12:14 2015 UTC,"amazon review highlights:   Do not buy this camera. I didn't even buy this thing on Amazon, but it is so bad I felt compelled to leave a review. Takes about one full second to take a picture. If you move AT ALL, your pictures are blurry. This is not a settings issue, but a bad camera issue. Takes terrible pictures. I used this camera for a total of 56 pictures and the telescoping lens broke in the half out and half in position therefore rendering the camera useless. Plus the buttons are too small for an adult user. Like the other reviewer, I didn't get this camera from Amazon--my husband bought it for me for my birthday because I needed an inexpensive digital camera to replace my old one. This camera sucks. It's supposed to be better than my old camera, not worse! I cannot for the life of me, get a simple decent still shot no matter what I do! I design for crafting companies and have an active blog--quality photo taking is not an option, it's a MUST and right now I have deadlines, 1 broken old camera and 1 new Polaroid iE826 camera that takes horrible pictures....just to clarify ""horrible""....FUZZY and BLURRY is what I mean. This is unacceptable. I cannot work with this camera. Could have used the $55 spent on this worthless piece of garbage toward a camera that will actually meet my very basic needs. What a waste and disappointment. If there was a ""no star"" rating this product would still struggle to reach that benchmark. Imagine if you can being drunk or glossy eyed, then have someone shove sand under your eyelids. Wash those bad boys out with lemon juice and you will get the idea of pain this pice of machinery causes. 18 MP of cruddy blotchy pics, that is of course when they aren't blurred.

Recently my friend and his new wife to went to Italy for their honeymoon. I let them borrow two of my lenses for his Sony NEX 3, a 35mm f1.8 and a 18-200mm travel lens. I told him to try shooting in aperture priority mode and taught him to set the aperture wide open for low light. When they got back they complained how bad the photos were and everything was ""red,"" blurry, dark, smeared, and the camera would shoot several times at every shot. They complained the camera was a complete POS and his wife was saying they should have never used the lenses and that they should have just shot in auto.  When I looked at the camera, pretty much EVERY SETTING THAT COULD BE WRONG WERE SET WRONG. The camera was on HDR mode, white balance was manually set completely off, ex compensation was like -2, and shutter speed was super long. I didn't think it was possible to have so many settings wrong at the same time, like they went through every setting and played around with every combination of them."

photography,3dyjj8,almathden,7,Mon Jul 20 16:06:19 2015 UTC,"I think your expectations might be a little off.   You'll have the greatest dynamic range at base ISO typically, which means the largest difference between the brightest thing in a scene before clipping, and the darkest thing before being totally consumed by noise.   But that doesn't mean you'll have the lowest noise at base ISO. You likely will have better noise performance at ISO 400 then 100. Just that at 100 you have much more signal so you aren't really comparing equal exposures.   Why you get more noise at ISO 100 is a different question but it has a lot to do with the way noise gets added during readout.   Once the electronics improve we might get to a ISOless world where noise is mostly driven by the sensor and then you would only ever need to shoot at base ISO.  Some cameras are already getting pretty close to being ISO invariant.   Dpreview actually did a decent article on this not too long ago that does a much better job explaining it then I could hope to: http://www.dpreview.com/articles/8189925268/what-s-that-noise-shedding-some-light-on-the-sources-of-noise"
photography,3dyjj8,DarkColdFusion,5,Mon Jul 20 16:42:10 2015 UTC,"What camera do you have? There are some cameras that are more ""ISO invariant,"" by which the reviewer means ""ISO 100 shot pushed by 5EV is essentially indistinguishable from the native ISO 3200 shot.""  http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/nikon-d7200/13  The common consensus is that Canon sensors tend not to have this characteristic. It's somewhat related to the dynamic range of the sensor, and also to the signal-to-noise that the sensor receives from shadow areas.  http://www.dpreview.com/previews/canon-eos-5ds-sr/7  Scroll down to the ""Raw DR: ISO-invariance"" section."
photography,3dyjj8,hopewings,3,Mon Jul 20 16:57:37 2015 UTC,"What they were saying was you have more DR at ISO 100. So you may recover shadows better in an ISO100 shot than an ISO800 shot, even though they have further to go.   I think you or they misunderstood. With the same exposure you will be able to pull back shadows better at lower ISO. So lets say one photo was taken either correctly exposed or two stops under exposed at [ISO100, f/4, and 1/800] while another was taken at the same correct exposure or the same two stops under exposed at [ISO800, f/4, and 1/2400]. The photo taken at ISO100 will allow greater recovery of shadows than the one shot at ISO800. However, this does not mean you are better maintaining your ISO at ISO100 and using post to recover extreme shadows as opposed to adjusting your ISO natively for proper exposure."
photography,3dyjj8,evanrphoto,2,Mon Jul 20 20:36:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think you're correct. Not sure if I misunderstood or if the post was poorly written. Going to vote that it wasn't my confusion ;)"
photography,3dyjj8,luminaeus,2,Mon Jul 20 22:15:00 2015 UTC,"Sounds like Canon read noise. Normally it's not a big deal because there's no reason to ever lift a shadow by five stops, but you'll notice it when doing 'tests' like this."
photography,3dyjj8,Aaberg123,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:53:32 2015 UTC,"I avoided such situations on my Canon, but have since come to embrace it a lot more after switching. I still rarely do 5 stop pushes, but 3 stops from iso 100 is not really a problem."
photography,3dyjj8,ordash,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:26:11 2015 UTC,"There is no ""grain"" in digital photographs just different kinds of noise, the hideous color noise and the more ""grain-like"" (i.e. more bearable) luminance-noise. The first is there even at base ISO if not filtered out, the second is there too but not really visible at low ISOs."

photography,3dyhcv,brittabear,7,Mon Jul 20 16:12:11 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply - and that's a good point.
photography,3dyhcv,T_O_G_G_Z,4,Mon Jul 20 16:15:50 2015 UTC,I was shooting at an event recently using a pair of studio heads. One on a radio and the other on slave. I noticed the slave was firing in response to some guests flashes so I put a radio receiver on that too so it didn't mess up the guests photos. I think its part of the job to balance what the *ographer needs to do and ensure you don't spoil it for any of the guests in the process.
photography,3dyhcv,tanstaafl90,4,Mon Jul 20 19:38:13 2015 UTC,Thank you - excellent response.  If wedding photography was my job I'd certainly have like-minded thinking.

photography,3dyhcv,geekygeekz,9,Mon Jul 20 16:16:18 2015 UTC,"So what do you think? Was I an ignorant asshole? Should I get his email address and apologize or offer a monetary tip or something for ""using"" his equipment?   Were you ignorantly making mistakes, causing the photographer's life to be a little more difficult?  Probably.    Do you owe him an apology? Probably not. There are people like that at most weddings. Professional photographers deal with that all the time.  In the future, the more polite thing to do is to go talk to the photographer(s) for a few seconds when they aren't busy, tell them you are a friend of so-and-so, and you want some good pictures but also want to stay out of their way.    In addition to telling you what to avoid and how to best stay out of their way, the photographer may help you out by pointing out key places or times when the best photos will be taken.  They know when and where different sets of photos will be taken, and might let you get in on some of them.  Other times when the family has a small pile of personal cameras you can put yours on the stack and they'll cycle through them all, giving everyone a picture."

photography,3dyhcv,geekygeekz,6,Mon Jul 20 18:24:34 2015 UTC,"You really shouldn't be using optical slaves when shooting an event, especially a wedding when half the guests are going to be using cameras with auto-flash.   You were taking care to stay out of his way, you can usually tell when people are doing that and he was probably appreciative of it."
photography,3dyhcv,almathden,6,Mon Jul 20 18:10:10 2015 UTC,There were a lot of point-and-shoot/auto-flash cameras for sure in the hands of the guests.  I thought it odd as well that he set up optical slaves; even I have radio transmitters at home and I'm just a pathetic amateur.  ;-)
photography,3dyhcv,geekygeekz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:40:53 2015 UTC,"Some flashes from point and shoot cameras might be powerful enough to trigger his lights as slaves.

I don't know if other speedlights are sensitive enough to trigger when they see an iPhone LED flash. I originally thought the optical slave was more sensitive, like even if turning the lights on and off will trigger it.  I was disappointed when I found out my phone couldn't trigger it optically. I was excited to use speedlights with my iPhone."
