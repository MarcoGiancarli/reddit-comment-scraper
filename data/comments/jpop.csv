jpop,3dy9xc,Zirr,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:55:44 2015 UTC,"Try out Perfume. This group shares the same producer, Yasutaka Nakata, with Kyary Pamyu Pamyu. As for upbeat pop, it varies really. Nakata also performs for Capsule but I find their songs less upbeat than KPP and Perfume's and don't enjoy them as much. Anime songs tend to be very upbeat..."
jpop,3dy9xc,Disaresta,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:45:58 2015 UTC,First of all welcome to the wonderful world of Jpop :)    In short almost anything by Nakata.  Natsume Mito https://youtu.be/cAIyMT7gARc this is one of the many Pv's for this song.  Galaxias!  https://youtu.be/axWA7hT6-2o  Also Crayon Pop (kpop) but they also make some jpop.
jpop,3dy9xc,Habieru7,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:22:21 2015 UTC,"yeah, anything by Yasutaka Nakata. Early Capsule sounds alot like KPP, and Mito Natsume  for more upbeat cute jpop, I'd also recommend: Dempagumi.inc Especia Up Up Girls"
jpop,3dxfc6,postoergopostum,7,Mon Jul 20 09:35:37 2015 UTC,"There are soooo many that fit this description! I have very similar tastes so hopefully these tips help.  First, any of the more recent Morning Musume tracks (.14 onwards) sound a lot like the one you mentioned so I'd definitely look into getting '14 shou ~the message~' which was their latest album.  Second, definitely Momoiro Clover Z. Their songs are pretty much the definition of taking a left turn and blowing your mind! (This is a good example- https://youtu.be/TIokp4MonxE). But again, all their stuff is great.  Third, Dempagumi.inc. They're never off my stereo at the moment. Ridiculous high energy electro pop, gets quite theatrical, but I absolutely love them (try this to start- https://youtu.be/fMHj3U3-RA4). Oh and they do an incredible cover of sabotage by the bestie boys!  A couple of quick others- Perfume if you like all out electro/dance, Maximum The Hormone if you like metal (male singer but a long way from your typical J-rock. Sound more like System Of A Down than anything else) and SCANDAL if you're looking for girls with guitars!  Hope these help, I can give some more examples if you need them!"

Ayu was my gateway into Jpop and my big Jpop love for a few years, but my interest waned after a few years so I'm more familiar with her older material. Some recommendations from her work then that you may like as they are in a somewhat similar style are listed below. Much of her work is really worth looking into though; from the first decade of releases most are just excellent, and I'd personally recommend (but obviously YMMV as these are personal) I am..., Memorial Address, Secret and LOVEppears most, with Rainbow and Duty close behind.

I would like, I would like some cake!  If you take a lot of cake, you might take second cup of coffe?  If you take the second cup so grab another cake!  Would you like, would you like some cake?  I would like, I would like some cake!  Oh yeah, oh yeah. Would you like some cake?  Grandpa: Then you should take Tosca cake!  When you are with fathers mother or your mother's mother  With a floral side plate so it is easy to be full.  Hey your rascal, leave nothing on the serving dish  If you don't take another one you might get a slap  Oh-oh-eh-oh  When you throw up in the napkin  Oh-oh-eh-oh  Second dessert is served  [refrain]  Grandmother has a big, big piece of pastry  Come now all the grandkids we eat  When you shove in more and more  Then she stands and shouts more more more!  After 100 liters of coffebread dough  Grandfather feels a little slow  But what is the old man doing  He double boosts his pacemaker!  See you later  Defibrillator!  And then the grandmother said to now have to take  Now you have to E-A-T  Would you like some more, no, stop stop stop  Grandmother takes more and thaws  [refrain]  Would you like, would you like some cake?  I would like, I would like some cake!  Oh-oh-eh-oh  Grandma shouts more more  Oh-oh-eh-oh  Until the whole family explodes!"

I've been a kpop listener for three years now and I feel you don't get that in kpop. Especially lately, when you have three or four music production teams that produce music for the whole idol industry. The songs get repetitive.  Anyways, just wanted to share my newbie opinion. I'm curious about opinions from long term Jpop fans.  EDIT:Oh and btw I like the song.It's not a musical masterpiece, but it's fun and different."
jpop,3cad1f,Imperator1346,2,Fri Jul 17 14:10:10 2015 UTC,"I was a KPOP fan before I got into JPOP (well I listen only to H!P). And I could say KPOP got boring really fast... it's all the same nowadays basically. Right now my favorite group is Juice=Juice, mainly because they like to experiment with music styles.  Check out the H!P reddit family: /r/MorningMusume /r/CuteHP /r/JuiceJuiceHP /r/Smileage /r/CountryMusume"
jpop,3cad1f,Imperator1346,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:40:02 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the reply. I already hang out on Momusu's subreddit a lot, I read a bunch of threads and I guess I will soon become a fan of the other groups too and visit their pages too.  I'm so in love with Momusu though. Like literally every ""newer"" song I heard is great, I'm still listening to those songs daily and the still don't bore me, which is very rare. I tried finding some variety shows with the current members and Sayumi/Reina and I wasn't very successful. I really like the whole variety show aspect of idol groups and I would really like to see some of it(subbed ofc). Was that just me or there is a real shortage of subbed material in that aspect?  As far as other H!P groups are concerned, for now I only checked out some of their songs and I quite like it. Unfortunately for me/us, Momusu's and the other groups subreddits are not very active?  Btw do you mind me PM you? I would like to know a bunch of things and I'm alone on my journey into jpop, and because of the fact that Jpop is not that much in the open and doesn't have as strong international following as kpop I would really like to have some jpop buddies."

This one in my opinion is MILES beyond Unicorn Parade, every song from the Battery single in fact was seriously solid. They're a new group so not as experienced, but if you like Perfume / the electronic side of JPop I definately recommend them, their new single Robot Boy Robot Girl comes out July 22nd as well. (Try to find Denshi Keisan no Yume if you can, my favorite from the Battery single, as well as their debut song Summer Kaijyu)"

I am not sure though, I'll take a look around if I hear anything I'll get back to you, but you may want to try purchasing through a dummy address in Japan and see if that fixes things. Good luck!

I recommend using YouTube to get all of these songs. It can be hard to find albums online, and they're pretty expensive to just buy. Normally I'd say support the artists, but like you said they have a ton of albums and when they're $30 each or so it's hard to afford.   If there's anything else you want to know feel free to reply here or send me a pm. :D  Edit: Alright, adjusted that privacy setting so you should be good to go. If you go back more than like 150 videos, it will be other types of music, so just warning ya.  Also, one website I've found to buy the albums legally is Otaku Republic, but as you can see it's super expensive. One of those FELT albums is $124!!

jpop,36s1r9,lovejapan777,1 point,Thu May 21 17:44:17 2015 UTC,"Boris just released three new follow up albums to Noise: New Noise Literacy 003, 004, and 005. They are titled ""urban dance"", ""warpath"", and ""asia"" (respectively).  Not necessarily in the same vein as Noise; but definitely worth a listen if you are into their drone releases. I think this is closer to The Thing Which Solomon Overlooked."
jpop,36n2pw,selery,5,Wed May 20 16:16:17 2015 UTC,"I notice that as well. Perhaps Japanese radio stations aren't as strict on how long a song can be in order to get airtime.  I've been listening to a lot of Yasutaka Nakata (capsule, Perfume, etc.) lately, and I couldn't help but think that a lot of these songs could be trimmed by a minute or two without affecting the quality."
jpop,36n2pw,eloguent,1 point,Wed May 20 23:58:57 2015 UTC,"Cling Cling suffered from this big time, it felt so repetitive and overly long. Could been length clipped severely and I might have even liked it even more."
jpop,36n2pw,spatulaController,5,Thu May 21 12:14:14 2015 UTC,I think part of it is because music in Japan is predominantly released as singles rather than full albums.
jpop,36n2pw,SearingFury,3,Fri May 22 02:16:37 2015 UTC,"As someone who's been listing to Japanese music for 14 years now they are without a doubt longer on average than your average American/English pop song. As for why, I've never really figured out why. I've looked into a few times and never really found any reasoning behind it. I think, but can't be sure, it may have something to do with Technology/music broadcasting progression and that at some early point in time the two differed in the way they projected their music to their audiences. This is just what I've thought of over the years... I've also noticed that song are structured in a way that they're easy to chop up and shorten to a 2 minute long version, for say performance on a TV show Music Station. This may be a result of the fact the song do tend to be so long. Typically on most western media channels they perform the whole song, not a half-length shortened version. I'd love to know a more concrete reasoning though. I'm sure the real reason been lost over many decades of slow but sure change."
jpop,36n2pw,spatulaController,1 point,Thu May 21 12:09:45 2015 UTC,"This is the closest thing to a correct answer.  Those TV performances are one of the primary modes of song promotion in Japan; they don't play music on the radio the way they do in the states, so there's no real call for a ""radio edit""; however, a TV edit that spans the first verse & chorus + bridge & last chorus is enough for the audience to get a good feel for how a song sounds.  The other thing is that it takes almost twice as many syllables as English to say most things in Japanese that you'd hear in songs. (This is also why most Jpop songs don't have just one chorus, they have a first chorus & a second chorus and they're different). So there are a ton of pop songs that have verses that are twice as long as they'd be in the USA.  The OTHER thing is that a longer song appears to be more bang for the consumer's buck (we saw the effects of a similar principle in the form of some of the complex rock music released stateside & in Europe in the 60s and 70s). CDs in Japan are expensive, and even people in Japan know that, so a longer & more substantial track was more appealing for a long, long time. Even now, buying music digitally, you don't wanna pay 150-250 yen for a 3-minute song. A 5 and a half minute song seems more reasonable."
jpop,36n2pw,zer0buscus,2,Wed May 27 19:37:42 2015 UTC,"It's something I noticed too when I started listening to Jpop and Kpop, many years ago. As for why? I have no idea. But if I had to venture a guess; maybe because a lot of Jpop and Kpop is centered around choreography??"

jpop,36fsic,versaillesversaille,2,Tue May 19 16:12:28 2015 UTC,"Same, I'm a fan of Reol. favorite song by her is no title"
jpop,36fsic,Miraga,2,Tue May 19 01:55:25 2015 UTC,"I'm another fan of Reol, one of my favorite covers she's done is FACE. She also sounds great with kradness."
jpop,36fsic,Miraga,1 point,Tue May 19 12:55:14 2015 UTC,I just want to point out that Reol is an actual vocalist. I feel like calling her a vocaloid artist is misleading.
jpop,36fsic,Miraga,1 point,Tue May 19 17:04:33 2015 UTC,But doesn't she use Kagamine Lin or Ren or whatever for the most part?
jpop,36gozu,Joushiiy,2,Tue May 19 06:40:26 2015 UTC,I'm pretty fond of Tokohana. It was used as the ending theme to black bullet.
jpop,36gozu,Notdog88,2,Tue May 19 06:53:47 2015 UTC,"As of right now, there are four albums you need to know.   Today is a Beautiful Day - Supercell album, her first big album, and will have most of the songs you're talking about in OP Owari no Hoshi no Love Song - compilation album with Jun Maeda (of CLANNAD/Kanon/Angel Beats fame) Each song is like a mini story, and most of them have PVs, so check it out on Youtube or something first. Euaru - her first solo album. The songs are pretty solid, and the b side is a bunch of covers including a really solid Uninstall cover. Polyomino - this one just came out and I'm not too familiar with it, but the songs are pretty good."
jpop,36gozu,AnEternalSkeptic,1 point,Tue May 19 17:59:15 2015 UTC,My favorite stuff from her is her work in Supercell and the Nagi No Asukara Sountrack
jpop,36gozu,no0t,1 point,Tue May 19 11:54:45 2015 UTC,"Not particularly rock, but check out the albums ""Owari no Hoshi no Love Song"" and ""Today is a Beautiful Day"". Both are by Maeda Jun and Ryo respectively and are sung by Yanagi Nagi.  Alternatively she used to go by the handle ""Gazelle"" so you can find some of her older songs that way too.   But yeah, I have a list here of Yanagi songs if you want to look up some of them. It doesn't include the tracks from Black Bullet or Nagi no Asukara though so be sure to look for those later too."

jpop,363sjb,akaBruce,1 point,Sun May 17 03:55:49 2015 UTC,"泉まくら  Lyrical School  ライムベリー  泉まくら is one of my favorite musical artists of all time. So if you aren't into the song I linked (which happens to be my favorite), you should check out her other stuff. I'm sure you'll be able to find something you'd like.  Also, her music (the music itself; she writes the lyrics) is produced by various people. So those producers might be another good place to look.  As for Lyrical School, I just linked to the song that is most similar to the average idol song. So if you aren't into it, again, try checking out their other stuff.  ライムベリー is not bad. They've come a long way. Their music gets better and better as they go on. It's matured a lot. Their earlier music is a lot simpler and cuter.  Also, here's a medley of different JPOP songs, most of which are hip-hop and R&B inspired (Tokyo Sunset). It's got a lot of older music in it. But it might be good for what you're looking for. It might at least help show you what's out there and help you find other music like it. And the person who made it has a few other medleys that are similar to it."

BENI is currently my favourite singer, she has an amazing voice, and she can also sing fluent English (She's also half Japanese, half American). Her English covers of some Japanese songs are also amazing.   her cover of ""Konayuki"" by Remioromen"

Based off the fact that you changed your reply to my comment and based on your post history, it's pretty obviously that you're concerned about people judging you for not somehow following the ""norm"" in terms of music anyways. Honestly you should not care what people think about you or the music that you listen to. Just listen to whatever you want."

jpop,35bdab,avianmountain,1 point,Sat May 9 01:29:39 2015 UTC,"I don't personally own that much, but I do like listening to 80s jpop through youtube and whatnot. I think the Japanese music industry is too conservative for its own good, trying to protect their CD sales (because that means so much in 2015 right?). Some people are getting better at selling to a global audience (Perfume comes to mind as a good example), but I'm not sure that things for the oldies will be changing anytime soon... oh well."

If anyone visits Japan it's really cool to go to see these smaller acts. They really appreciate it. And they do these a lot.. Like four times a week.  After the gig I somehow joined the managers for drinks and food. One of the producers even gave me a DVD of a 2& live show. Really cool dudes.

If you go in a store in Japan it's mostly separated into POPS/ROCK (which means Western music) and JPOP. The Pillows would be in JPOP. So in that sense yes.   Many Westerners also use the term to refer to the various pop singers and idols only, like Kyary and AKB, etc.  instead of Japanese music as a whole.   So it depends on who you're talking to I suppose."

jpop,33kvl8,Rylix,2,Thu Apr 23 22:10:45 2015 UTC,"I looked at a ""similiar artist map"" for Anna Tsuchiya for these artist recommendations:       Nanase Aikawa - Ai no Uta - Magenta Rain- Nana Kitade - Kesenai Tsumi Tommy heavenly6 - PAPERMOON (she has a few aliases and also sings for The Brilliant Green - Ashe Like Snow).   These are also more my own thing:   SCANDAL - Harukaze SCANDAL - Shunkan Sentimental HIGH and MIGHTY COLOR - Ichirin no Hana Stereopony - Hitohira no Hanabira YUI - Again Konomi Suzuki - Avenge World Bonus?   These songs aren't exactly cheery so maybe that last one will help."
jpop,33kvl8,dokks,2,Thu Apr 23 17:57:15 2015 UTC,Ah I had forgotten about High and Mighty Color. Thanks for the reminder!

jpop,334qmc,RMcD94,1 point,Tue Apr 21 11:47:14 2015 UTC,Not that I'm aware.  Just the auto captions in YouTube which are always inaccurate.
