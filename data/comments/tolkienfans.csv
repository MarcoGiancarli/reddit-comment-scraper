tolkienfans,3e2tdm,ronanconway,77,Tue Jul 21 15:01:29 2015 UTC,"Sauron took the Nine Rings from the Nazgul and with them he still maintained control over their will.  Here's what Tolkien had to say about Frodo at Mt Doom regarding the Nazgul in the situation:   When Sauron was aware of the seizure of the Ring his one hope was in its power: that the claimant would be unable to relinquish it until Sauron had time to deal with him. Frodo too would then probably, if not attacked, have had to take the same way: cast himself with the Ring into the abyss. If not he would of course have completely failed. It is an interesting problem: how Sauron would have acted or the claimant have resisted. Sauron sent at once the Ringwraiths. They were naturally fully instructed, and in no way deceived as to the real lordship of the Ring. The wearer would not be invisible to them, but the reverse; and the more vulnerable to their weapons. But the situation was now different to that under Weathertop, where Frodo acted merely in fear and wished only to use (in vain) the Ring's subsidiary power of conferring invisibility. He had grown since then. Would they have been immune from its power if he claimed it as an instrument of command and domination?   Not wholly. I do not think they could have attacked him with violence, nor laid hold upon him or taken him captive; they would have obeyed or feigned to obey any minor commands of his that did not interfere with their errand – laid upon them by Sauron, who still through their nine rings (which he held) had primary control of their wills. That errand was to remove Frodo from the Crack. Once he lost the power or opportunity to destroy the Ring, the end could not be in doubt – saving help from outside, which was hardly even remotely possible. ~Letter 246   (Emphasis mine)"
tolkienfans,3e2tdm,italia06823834,29,Tue Jul 21 15:12:08 2015 UTC,"The last paragraph is the most interesting to me. If the Nazgûl were unable to take Frodo captive or lay hold of him once he claimed the Ring, then how would they have completed Sauron's errand?  The only scenario I imagine working out for Sauron involves them ""feigning to obey"" Frodo. They would have arrived and probably dispatched or captured Gollum and Sam. Getting Ring out of danger would then involve making Frodo think that they were under his control in some manner. Tricksy wraiths."
tolkienfans,3e2tdm,EyeceEyeceBaby,48,Tue Jul 21 15:46:34 2015 UTC,"I had only included the part relevant to OP's original question.  Regarding yours, Tolkien continues in the next paragraph...   Frodo had become a considerable person, but of a special kind: in spiritual enlargement rather than in increase of physical or mental power; his will was much stronger than it had been, but so far it had been exercised in resisting not using the Ring and with the object of destroying it. He needed time, much time, before he could control the Ring or (which in such a case is the same) before it could control him; before his will and arrogance could grow to a stature in which he could dominate other major hostile wills. Even so for a long time his acts and commands would still have to seem 'good' to him, to be for the benefit of others beside himself.   The situation as between Frodo with the Ring and the Eight* might be compared to that of a small brave man armed with a devastating weapon, faced by eight savage warriors of great strength and agility armed with poisoned blades. The man's weakness was that he did not know how to use his weapon yet; and he was by temperament and training averse to violence. Their weakness that the man's weapon was a thing that filled them with fear as an object of terror in their religious cult, by which they had been conditioned to treat one who wielded it with servility. I think they would have shown 'servility'. They would have greeted Frodo as 'Lord'. With fair speeches they would have induced him to leave the Sammath Naur – for instance 'to look upon his new kingdom, and behold afar with his new sight the abode of power that he must now claim and turn to his own purposes'. Once outside the chamber while he was gazing some of them would have destroyed the entrance. Frodo would by then probably have been already too enmeshed in great plans of reformed rule – like but far greater and wider than the vision that tempted Sam (III 177)5 – to heed this. But if he still preserved some sanity and partly understood the significance of it, so that he refused now to go with them to Barad-dûr, they would simply have waited. Until Sauron himself came. In any case a confrontation of Frodo and Sauron would soon have taken place, if the Ring was intact. Its result was inevitable. Frodo would have been utterly overthrown: crushed to dust, or preserved in torment as a gibbering slave. Sauron would not have feared the Ring! It was his own and under his will. Even from afar he had an effect upon it, to make it work for its return to himself. In his actual presence none but very few of equal stature could have hoped to withhold it from him.      *The Witch-king had been reduced to impotence.   He then goes on to say, no mortals could have hoped to withhold it and gain control of the Ring.  He speculates only Gandalf and the other bearers of the Three could Maybe have done it."

He would then abduct them, or better yet manipulate them into distrusting their homeland and head over to Sauron's side, where he'd capture them and torture them with magic, thus turning them into Orcs. So every Orc you see was at one point an elf.   I recently finished the extended version of The Stand by Stephen King, and Randall Flagg/The Darkman is Sauron incarnate as well lol, he assumes various forms and is known by many different names by the people of the world.

But Sauron did fool and coerce the Dunadain.  Here's the passage from the Silmarillion about the Orcs:  ""But of those unhappy ones (the Quendi) who were ensnared by Melkor little is known of a certainty. For who of the living had descended into the pits of Utumno, or had explored the darkness of the counsels of Melkor? Yet this is held true by the wise of Eressea, that all those of the Quendi who came into the hands of Melkor, ere Utumno was broken, were put there in prison, and by slow arts of cruelty were corrupted and enslaved; and thus did Melkor breed the hideous race of the Orcs in envy and mockery of the Elves, of whom they were afterwards the bitterest of foes.""  I muddled it together, my bad!"
tolkienfans,3e2tdm,italia06823834,8,Tue Jul 21 23:02:52 2015 UTC,"There's a tricky thing with Orcs though....  Tolkien never decided on an origin.  The Silmarillion present orcs from elves because it is what fit best when Christopher Tolkien was compiling it. In the foreward he describes his attempts to make the most internally consistent narrative, not necessarily the most accurate to his father latest drafts.  In actuality JRR had long rejected orcs from elves. He thought Morgoth couldn't corrupt a species like the Quendi so completely that they'd lose their immortality and have that trait be inheritble (orcs are mortal and reprpduce sexually, which btw even if orcs were from elves, not every orc was once an elf). Later writing appear to lean toward orcs from Men, even though that would require serious reworking of the timeline of when Men awake."

We already know that, and we know the rings are connected seeing as how they failed when the One was destroyed. Since the relationship from the three to Sauron is small I believe that the connection itself was small, and that all the connection was really good for was making the three useless when the One is destroyed. Sauron knows the elves love their land and the fact that their rings preserve it, and I think he held this over the elves, which I believe some text does support"

The Howian balrog would take my vote for 'best monster design' in terms of its basic look, but it's not difficult to triumph over a humanoid shape, and there's much more to the balrog than its figure. The Howian balrog, Nasmith's balrog, and most other depictions present the demon far too much as a beast.  Tolkien's balrog displays intelligence, and it displays power far greater than its form suggests. Gandalf, physically, is just an old man, yet his actions inspire awe. Likewise, despite it's simplistic form, Tolkien's balrog is able to put on displays of power far greater than one might think it capable of. In its introduction, we read of it tiring out Gandalf - Gandalf who helped out Bilbo and the dwarves, chased out the Necromancer, raced across Middle-earth, scared off the Ringwraiths! It's quite a big deal at that point that the balrog is really only second to Saruman in terms of what harm has been done to Gandalf as far as the reader knows. What we see is only a figure shrouded in darkness, but it's leaping across a great chasm, and we can only discern a flaming sword and whip. And then the two are gone."

tolkienfans,3e1ilz,Mysta02,3,Tue Jul 21 15:25:25 2015 UTC,What?  No.  Where is that quote?
tolkienfans,3e1ilz,AmbiguousAnonymous,4,Tue Jul 21 17:36:25 2015 UTC,"/u/Mysta02 is probably thinking of a line in the account of 'The Fall of Gondolin' in The Book of Lost Tales 2, where balrogs do ride on the backs of dragons. However, they do not fly, and this was in the context of a very early conception of Tolkien's mythology."
tolkienfans,3e1ilz,Edledhron,2,Tue Jul 21 18:00:57 2015 UTC,So early Balrogs weren't even Maiar yet and Tuor kills a handful himself along with Ecthelion.

It stepped forward slowly on to the bridge, and suddenly it drew itself up to a great height, and its wings were spread from wall to wall; but still Gandalf could be seen, glimmering in the gloom; he seemed small, and altogether alone: grey and bent, like a wizened tree before the onset of a storm."
tolkienfans,3e1ilz,xixor,10,Tue Jul 21 15:00:29 2015 UTC,"Just a few line before it says it shadow spread out ""like two vast wings"". ""Its wings spread"" is an extension of that analogy."

The Balrog made no answer. The fire in it seemed to die, but the darkness grew. It stepped forward slowly on to the bridge, and suddenly it drew itself up to a great height, and its wings were spread from wall to wall; but still Gandalf could be seen, glimmering in the gloom; he seemed small, and altogether alone: grey and bent, like a wizened tree before the onset of a storm.  I never really saw it before, but everything is being enveloped by the huge wings of shadow and darkness that are spreading forth from the Balrog and Gandalf is almost obscured by this darkness.   Weird how I never saw it like that before... I'm even more sure they aren't real wings now!"
tolkienfans,3e1ilz,Dazines,5,Tue Jul 21 19:51:41 2015 UTC,"It's a metaphor woven together from three metaphors that have been building through the passage, and I've used it for years as the strongest argument against wings if you're just looking at LotR itself and nothing else. That there is the culminating passage, where Tolkien brings them all together into one. You've actually missed one thread: height, or the semblance of being greater than it is. That's one of the three, along with the wings and the cloud."
tolkienfans,3e1ilz,Uluithiad,2,Tue Jul 21 20:11:26 2015 UTC,I guess I've always just taken the shadow wings for granted so I've never really examined it that closely before... It really is great writing.

Later, Gimli mentions the Balrog's shadow:   'I cannot,' said Gimli. `But I am glad that the shadow came no nearer. I liked it not at all. Too much it reminded me of the shadow in Moria - the shadow of the Balrog,' he ended in a whisper.   Making it seem like the Balrog, and the shadow, are two separate entities.  Tolkien also uses the word 'fly' several times in the sentences surrounding that passage, which also help to implant the though of flying and wings into the readers minds, at least, they do to me a bit   `Fly! This is a foe beyond any of you. I must hold the narrow way. Fly!   'Fly, you fools! '  Even as Aragorn and Boromir came flying back, the rest of the bridge cracked and fell."
tolkienfans,3e1ilz,xixor,2,Tue Jul 21 20:01:15 2015 UTC,"I think that the shadow is meant to be more of a description of a sensation; the Balrog is corporeal, but the spiritual presence and malice would be as terrifying as Gandalf's presence is comforting and heartening.  Interesting note about the use of the word fly, also."
tolkienfans,3e1ilz,GrimnirOdinson,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:31:37 2015 UTC,"Making it seem like the Balrog, and the shadow, are two separate entities.   Yes I never saw it like that before, but I like that idea. It's almost as though Gandalf has defeated the first layer of evil, leaving the physical creature, whose fire then gets quenched... The fire could be another dimension to the Balrog?"
tolkienfans,3e1ilz,Dazines,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:16:49 2015 UTC,"The fire could be another dimension to the Balrog?   Yes, definitely.  If you read the passage in The Two Towers where Gandalf recalls his fight with the Balrog:   'Name him not!' said Gandalf, and for a moment it seemed that a cloud of pain passed over his face, and he sat silent, looking old as death. 'Long time I fell,' he said at last, slowly, as if thinking back with difficulty. 'Long I fell, and he fell with me. His fire was about me. I was burned. Then we plunged into the deep water and all was dark. Cold it was as the tide of death: almost it froze my heart.'  He was with me still. His fire was quenched, but now he was a thing of slime, stronger than a strangling snake.  The sun shone fiercely there, but all below was wrapped in cloud. Out he sprang, and even as I came behind, he burst into new flame. There was none to see, or perhaps in after ages songs would still be sung of the Battle of the Peak.'   Those that looked up from afar thought that the mountain was crowned with storm. Thunder they heard, and lightning, they said, smote upon Celebdil, and leaped back broken into tongues of fire.  A great smoke rose about us, vapour and steam. Ice fell like rain. I threw down my enemy, and he fell from the high place and broke the mountain-side where he smote it in his ruin.   Fire is definitely an aspect of the Balrog.  It was quenched, and so presumably couldn't re-ignite.  It is not a pure creature of fire, and exists without it.  But given the right conditions can re-ignite, presumably gaining back some power."

tolkienfans,3dvvx6,cats_are_pussies,18,Sun Jul 19 23:37:44 2015 UTC,"Huor's ""eyes of death"" are probably relevant; Feanor also gained foresight shortly before dying:   And looking out from the slopes of Ered Wethrin with his last sight he beheld far off the peaks of Thangorodrim, mightiest of the towers of Middle-earth, and knew with the foreknowledge of death that no power of the Noldor would ever overthrow them; but he cursed the name of Morgoth thrice, and laid it upon his sons to hold to their oath, and to avenge their father.   But there are Men who had foresight outside of this kind of special circumstance. ""Malbeth the Seer"" is referenced a few times in LotR: he foresaw that if King Arvedui didn't reunite Arnor and Gondor ""much sorrow and many lives of men shall pass, until the Dúnedain arise and are united again"", and also foretold Aragorn traveling the Paths of the Dead.  It's also likely that Aragorn himself had some degree of foresight. He worries for Gandalf if they enter Moria:   'Of course not!' said Gandalf. 'Who would? But the question is: who will follow me, if I lead you there?'  'I will,' said Gimli eagerly.  'I will,' said Aragorn heavily. 'You followed my lead almost to disaster in the snow, and have said no word of blame. I will follow your lead now - if this last warning does not move you. It is not of the Ring, nor of us others that I am thinking now, but of you, Gandalf. And I say to you: if you pass the doors of Moria, beware!'   He also seems to sense danger shortly before the breaking of the Fellowship:   'Why are you waking?' asked Frodo. 'It is not your watch.'  'I do not know,' answered Aragorn; 'but a shadow and a threat has been growing in my sleep. It would be well to draw your sword.'  'Why?' said Frodo. 'Are enemies at hand?'  'Let us see what Sting may show,' answered Aragorn.  Frodo then drew the elf-blade from its sheath. To his dismay the edges gleamed dimly in the night. 'Orcs!' he said. 'Not very near, and yet too near, it seems.'   And possibly predicts his reunion with Eomer on the Pelennor Fields, though this may have just been a lucky guess:   'Alas! Aragorn my friend!' said Éomer. 'I had hoped that we should ride to war together; but if you seek the Paths of the Dead, then our parting is come, and it is little likely that we shall ever meet again under the Sun.'  'That road I will take, nonetheless,' said Aragorn. 'But I say to you, Éomer, that in battle we may yet meet again, though all the hosts of Mordor should stand between.'      'Thus we meet again, though all the hosts of Mordor lay between us,' said Aragorn. 'Did I not say so at the Hornburg?'  'So you spoke,' said Éomer, 'but hope oft deceives, and I knew not then that you were a man foresighted. Yet twice blessed is help unlooked for, and never was a meeting of friends more joyful.' And they clasped hand in hand.   And then there are prophetic dreams: Faramir and Boromir had the dreams that led Boromir to seek council in Rivendell, and (many centuries earlier) Beren saw that his father's company had been betrayed by Gorlim and killed."

tolkienfans,3dvvx6,h0vden,3,Mon Jul 20 10:18:00 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, most of your examples of Aragorn's foresightedness are actually examples of his skills as a ranger at observation and deduction, and a testament to his experience.   Aragorn has traversed the mines of Moria before, entering from the east through the Great Gates in Dimrill Dale. He may not have known of the specific dangers within, but it would not be too much of a leap to conclude that he felt the power of the Balrog - a Maiar, like Gandalf himself - and deduced that the one most in danger from it was the one person most capable of facing it. Aragorn ""senses"" danger rather than foresees it; or, as he says,   ... a shadow and a threat has been growing in my sleep.  Finally, his declaration to Eomer is not so much prescience as it is foresightedness forged from deduction; he knows he is Isildur's heir, and thus can command the dead host. He knows that the armies of Mordor are gathering, and preparing to strike at Minas Tirith. He knows that the Rohirrim will ride to Gondor's aid, and their prowess in battle. Combining all this knowledge, his prediction is a matter of probability, not possibility.   That said, I would not say that Aragorn was not foresighted. There are probably examples of his prescience, especially in the appendices. Unfortunately, I do not have my copy of LotR at hand right now to check."

tolkienfans,3dviql,Somedamnguy,6,Mon Jul 20 03:14:17 2015 UTC,"I think what he is trying to say is that it is false that everyone is going through the same shit, not that your opinion of Frodo is invalid. With the exception of sam, none of the other members of the fellowship fully understand how much of a burden the ring is."
tolkienfans,3dviql,jamieisawesome777,3,Mon Jul 20 04:13:17 2015 UTC,"Oh man, I'll tell you my pet peeve about frodo. My pet peeve about him is gollum. Ya ya ya, gollum swore to serve his master and all, but gollum is so so sneaky and tricksy. Maybe it's because I've seen the movies,  and I know (spoiler) that gollum ends up betraying frodo, but frodo had so many opportunities to ditch gollums stank ass but it never happened!"
tolkienfans,3dviql,rainmaninjapan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:28:18 2015 UTC,"Yes but WHY would Frodo abandon him, when he needs Gollum to lead him to Mordor? Gollum has actually been there, and traveled there, and knows all sorts of things about moving unseen. They NEED him. Frodo also has sympathy for Gollum. He knows that what caused Gollum's  current condition is the end result of the what he is experiencing in regards to the Ring's corrupting influence. Makes plenty of sense why he wouldn't ditch Gollum's stank-ass."
tolkienfans,3dviql,juandh,2,Tue Jul 21 03:25:43 2015 UTC,"Very solid points, I don't have any rebuttals. I guess it plays out for a tug-of-war on my feelings towards Gollum"
tolkienfans,3dviql,magradhaid,-7,Tue Jul 21 04:02:56 2015 UTC,"I think you could skip ahead in that part of the story without too much lost, so long as you go back.  Seriously, the two plotlines are almost totally separate. The only reasons to read them as is are 1. to keep up suspense and 2. because you don't dare read things other than the way Tolkien ordained. We all know what happens at the end, reading about it first won't spoil the battles that occur this side of Mordor."
tolkienfans,3dviql,juandh,8,Mon Jul 20 00:20:35 2015 UTC,"I would say that what happens at the Black Gate in particular would be enough to recommend reading it in order, and without knowing beforehand what happens to Frodo and Sam.   We all know what happens at the end   You never know; there could be someone out there who never saw the movies and has somehow remained spoiler-resistant."
tolkienfans,3dviql,SurrealSage,4,Mon Jul 20 01:23:08 2015 UTC,"IIRC, the books themselves leave it open to question whether the ultimate quest was in time, until the plotlines merge again. One can guess how the quest turns out but the fate of other characters is up in the air and still of great relish to read. But apparently a dissenting opinion is very unpopular here so maybe I should shut up and not give this guy advice that he asked for..."

tolkienfans,3dviql,Uluithiad,2,Mon Jul 20 02:13:50 2015 UTC,"Which brings up a question (the Black Gate).  What happens there leaves the reader in doubt about how Sam/Frodo faired, seeing as they appear to have lost all their gear, and I recall even Gandalf went a little pale before scooping everything up. So, traumatic for the reader.  But for Gandalf? We (the reader) didn't know it yet, but Gandalf had one of the Elven Rings - so he would have known immediately if Sauron had the One Ring (and why the hell would Sauron slow play it if he did have it?).  So . . . what's the deal with the encounter at the Black Gate?"

tolkienfans,3dty6q,sdb2754,33,Sun Jul 19 13:01:36 2015 UTC,"Ents are not trees, they are a seperate race of beings in middle earth. When Iluvitar's children(men, elves, and kinda dwarves) appeared yavana foresaw death and destruction for her 'things that grow.' She pleaded for a protector to look after the plants of middle earth, So Iluvitar created the ents as shepherds of the trees. They do resemble trees; just as dwarves came from stone and thus love working stone, ents were made from trees so they can better live amongst and protect the trees. I think if you were to walk by an ent that was keeping still in the forest it would definitely stand out as something different and unique, but you would be able to write it off as nothing more than an odd-looking tree. We don't know exactly what huorns are. Like you said, they are either regular trees that the ents have awoke, or they were ents that have become almost completely treeish. I believe the latter. In the first age, the elves are the ones that actually enlightened the ents and taught them language, so I think it makes sense that some ents would, through the ages, just fall out of practice and revert back to their roots(pun intended) as silent guardians that can fuck shit up when roused. Like men who also received a spark of wisdom from elves, but eventually lost it except for a few noble remnants. To me, huorns being treeish ents would also explain the old forest by the shire, and old man willow. There doesn't seem to be any ents nearby to rouse trees, and why would they anyway? And it seems like an odd coincidence to me that Tom bombadil, another mysterious ancient being, happens to live amongst them like it's an isolated little time capsule. Either way, huorns are indistinguishable from regular trees. After the battle at helm's deep, the huorns that cut off the orcs retreat is described as just a forest ""with tangled bough and hoary head; their twisted roots were buried in the long green grass."" It was a scary and ominous forest, but still appeared to be just a forest that sprang up out of nowhere. As far as the ents' appearance, They came in many shapes and sizes, with different colours, heights, number of toes and fingers, length of limbs, etc. These are from the treebeard chapter:   ""The ents were as different from one another as trees from trees...a few seemed more or less related to treebeard, and reminded them of beech-trees or oaks...Some recalled the chestnut...Some recalled the ash...some the fir...and others the birch, the rowan, and the linden. But when the ents all gathered round treebeard...the hobbits saw that they were all of the same kindred, and all had the same eyes...""  ...there were a few older ents, bearded and gnarled like hale but ancient trees(though none looked as ancient as treebeard); and there were tall strong ents, clean-limbed and smooth-skinned like forest-trees in their prime.""   To me the ents are really one of the best characters in the book for visualizing in your own imagination. Tolkien creates this whole aura around the ents, where you're not just using physical descriptions to visualize their appearance, you're also using the way they move, the way they talk, the way they act. I think the movies nailed the ents. The look, the mannerisms, were always how I imagined them. As for the trolls, I didn't have any problems with the depictions (except maybe the cockney accent). As far as I remember, tolkien's trolls were your standard big, strong, thuggish trolls."
tolkienfans,3dty6q,buckydean,2,Sun Jul 19 15:05:15 2015 UTC,I always pictured the trolls as being more human looking than the large baby looking things in the movies. I think they should at least have hair

I hope you talk about the intentions of the theological intentions of Tolkien while writing the work, I always enjoy these discussions more, than say a blow by blow account of whats happening in the Silmarillion or who everyone is related to.  Here are some things that you should avoid doing, (which I have seen other podcasts do):  1) The 'did you know' angle, these come across as patronising, and we Tolkien fans often do know.  2) Relate everything to LOTR or the Jackson films.  3) Make silly mistakes. Obviously no body gets everything right and not knowing the pronunciation is fine. But still make sure you research your points. Things like talking about Orcs and Goblins as different things, or any talk about elves dying are some big no-nos.  4) Focus on things like who's the powerful, or who would win in a fight. These kind of questions often miss the purpose and greatness of the work.  I wish you the best of luck, and I will listen. I had even thought about doing a Tolkien podcast myself (which is why I must seem so opinionated). If you need any help or ideas of what to talk about (or even help editing the audio) please message me. I am very excited about your project."

There's very little information about them other than the knowledge that they were developed in Angband during the first age.  It would probably be fair compare the Nazgul mounts to the Eagles since they are both bird like. However, there's no direct correspondence with the winged mounts and the Eagles as there are with Trolls & Ents. Eagles have been around for a lot longer, and are far more important/intelligent than the Nazgul mounts.  Wargs/Werewolves have been in service of the enemy since the first age. Though Sauron took a particular affinity to them. Their only good counterpart would be Huan a hound that accompanied Luthien on her quest and wrestled with Sauron."
tolkienfans,3ds6ux,PrivateChicken,26,Sun Jul 19 00:49:51 2015 UTC,"Dragons are also curious as not all of them (notably the first of them, Glaurung) can fly. Tolkien does use the old anglo-saxon ""worm"" moniker to describe dragons, so maybe we can surmise that they were initially corrupted from a more naturalistic source  When Morgoth bred Carcharoth the Great Wolf of Angband "" he chose one from among the whelps of the race of Draugluin; and he fed him with his own hand upon living flesh, and put his power upon him."" This is fairly similar to the description Tolkien gives of the fell beasts with Sauron in the Third Age -  ""And the Dark Lord took it, and nursed it with fell meats, until it grew beyond the measure of all other things that fly""  So it seems, evil cannot create new life, but it can corrupt anything to grow hideously. The dragons could then have conceivably come from almost anywhere."

Balrogs, like their master, are probably incarnate in a single physical body.  Most of the maiar we meet are actually incarnate into a physical body. The istari take on the bodies of old men, Melian a form similar to an elf.  Sauron has a physical body as well, but he retained the ability to shapeshift up until the fall of Numenor. It's probably more akin to the magic Beorn possesses than the changing of forms ""like raiment"" we're told of in the Silmarillion.  The distinction is important, because death in arda occurs with when the spirit leaves the body. Thus, Gandalf, Durin's Bane, Sauron ect. couldn't die as they do in the books unless they had incarnate forms."

tolkienfans,3drx0h,jrrtolkiennerd,7,Sun Jul 19 00:54:15 2015 UTC,"Soon afterwards the Long Winter began, and Rohan lay under snow for nearly five months. Both the Rohirrim and their foes suffered grievously in the cold, and in the dearth that lasted longer...Helm grew fierce and gaunt for famine and grief; and the dread of him alone was worth many men in the defence of the Burg. He would go out by himself, clad in white, and stalk like a snow-troll into the camps of his enemies, and slay many men with his hands. It was believed that if he bore no weapon no weapon would bite on him. The Dunlendings said that if he could find no food he ate men. That tale lasted long in Dunland. Helm had a great horn, and soon it was marked that before he sallied forth he would blow a blast upon it that echoed in the Deep; and then so great a fear fell on his enemies that instead of gathering to take him or kill him they fled away down the Coomb.  ‘One night men heard the horn blowing, but Helm did not return. In the morning there came a sun-gleam, the first for long days, and they saw a white figure standing still on the Dike, alone, for none of the Dunlendings dared come near. There stood Helm, dead as a stone, but his knees were unbent. Yet men said that the horn was still heard at times in the Deep and the wraith of Helm would walk among the foes of Rohan and kill men with fear.   You're entitled to your impressions, of course, but I find Helm's one-man shock and awe tactics to be purely badass."

Only selections from them, in most places abridged, are here presented. Their principal purpose is to illustrate the War of the Ring and its origins, and to fill up some of the gaps in the main story.""  This is from Tolkien's introduction to Appendix A and I feel it provides appropriate insight into the purpose of the material contained throughout the Appendices. You will get some overlap with The Silmarillion, no doubt, primarily as concerned with its last two sections ""Akkalbeth"" and ""Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age."" However, it's often very interesting if not vital information and presented more thoroughly than in The Silmarillion, which can be even more abridged at times.   In the case of ""The Tale of Arwen and Aragorn,"" for example, it's an important piece of writing in the context of Aragorn's journey as a character, and was very important to Tolkien, but he never really found a satisfactory way to fit it into the narrative of LotR without slowing the story down, so he placed it and other larger and smaller pieces in the Appendices."

As for other reading outside what you named and The Hobbit and LotR you'll want to look at Letters of JRR Tolkien and A Reader's Companion by Hammond and Scull.  Do you plan on limiting yourself to The Hobbit and LotR as primary text sources (since those were the only ones finished/completed in Tolkien's lifetime)? Or will you be using everything from The Silmarillion through History of Middle-earth?   Also its good to see someone who isn't just asking us ""I want to write my paper on Tolkien.... what should I write about? ""  Hopefully when you're finished you will post here."
tolkienfans,3dq8fa,italia06823834,3,Sat Jul 18 12:17:00 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your answer!  I have not actually thought of the Sackeville-Bagginses at all! Which is a rather good point, rather greedy and rude as they are as Hobbits. But I don't think I'll be able to include them; I could of course take a look at the 'bad' Hobbits (the ones with tendency towards evil) for an example in the chapter The Scouring of the Shire but this would, I think, be a bit off the point. From a wider perspective I cannot go claiming that every hobbit is good because of their connection to nature etc. but will have to search for common features that most of Hobbits share and can be derived from their natural habitat and thus support my argument.  All in all I guess the biggest limitation to my writing will be the word limit (8000-10 000 words). I simply cannot argue every point nor can I nobly criticize every point either. Since I am making a statement: ""The natural way of living of the Hobbits makes them resilient towards power"" (or something of this nature, still undecided) I will have to merely try and promote the arguments that support this.  What I could do, however, is use the chapter The Scouring of The Shire as an example of their resilience; it didn't take too long for The Shire to recuperate from the demolition, and more than anything it showed a good spirit of community and interdependance of other people.  I actually do have both of those books you mentioned in my shelf and intend to use them! The problem with the Letters is that they require quite some time to go through, and if anyone would be willing to tip me straight to related letters (environmentalism, ecology, Hobbits etc.) it would be of unmeasurable help.  As to limiting myself when it comes to primary literature, I will limit my self to The Lord of the Rings only. This is due many reasons, of which biggest is the limited word count and the limitations in amounts of arguments it brings. Unless someone has good valid arguments in favor of my thesis to take from the Hobbit of course! I will, however, mention The Hobbit when I introduce Tolkien. I have read The Silmarillion though, together with Narn i Chin Hurin and other Tolkien related literature, but they rarely even mention Hobbits and thus I think I'm confident in leaving them away from this thesis. Thank you still for the recommendations! Google Scholar has also been of help while finding academic written material on Tolkien and Hobbits.  Another question regarding the spelling since I am not a native speaker. I write Hobbits with a capital 'H' when talking of them as a race?"
tolkienfans,3dq8fa,italia06823834,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:46:53 2015 UTC,"Hobbits with a capital ""H""  I would. ""Men"" also has a captial ""M"" when referring to the race, whereas ""men"" refers to the gender."

tolkienfans,3dq8fa,NoteTypical,3,Sat Jul 18 15:40:58 2015 UTC,"I will argue that it was their love for nature (and thus ability to naturally live in harmony with nature) that made Hobbits the only possible nominees for destroying the ring – an embodiment of power, the machine, industrial subordination and the ultimate dominance over other beings.    The Silvan Elves certainly live in peace and harmony with nature."
tolkienfans,3dq8fa,NoteTypical,2,Sat Jul 18 13:41:13 2015 UTC,"You are correct. I pondered on this topic and truly had to try and 'find' my way around it to be able to stick with my claim.  In Ents, Elves and Eriador. The Environmental Vision of J.R.R Tolkien. (2006), Dickerson, M. Evans, J. separate the relationships of Hobbits, Elves and Ents towards nature intro three categories: Hobbits represent the Agrarian (and simple) Society, Elves the Horticulture and Aesthetic Society and Ents Feraculture with Woods and Wilderness. So I guess I could argue that the simple life together with nature is the driving force for resisiting power, whereas the Elves have an interest in wanting to learn more, perhaps? And that 'wanting more' even in regarding only something as pure as knowledge is ill-fated (Ikaros, Prometheus). And since I am working on the issue of resisting and handling power, the elves have had their share of misery because of showing properties connected to power (greed, pride, etc.). A prime example of this of course is Fëanor and his mutiny.  The Silvan Elves do definitely live in peace and harmony with nature, but perhaps their innate great strength and lack of simplicity (power + power = destructive power) makes them not as great nominees for destroyers of the ring. I might be completely wrong and making a fool of myself , but nonethelss have to try and counter-argue. The Silvan Elves probably would be a second best guess for handlers of the Ring, right after Hobbits and Tom Bombadil.  A fine point though, I thank you for it!"

Sauron originally intended for all the Rings to be worn by Elves, who were immortal to begin with. The individual who kept the Ring would not grow or obtain more life, however; they would merely continue until living became unendurable"
tolkienfans,3dq8fa,EricKei,2,Sat Jul 18 17:32:15 2015 UTC,"That's not the same as aging. And that passage specifically is referring to why Bilbo doesn't age while he possesses the Ring. It's referring to the misconception that Sauron created the Rings to give to Men and create Ringwraiths. Instead, he intended them to be worn by Elves, who were at the time his greatest apparent threat and the group over whom he held the least influence, allowing him to dominate them. Ringwraiths are a pale shadow of what a Lord of the Eldar with a Ring would have been. The ability to dominate other wills is the sole designed property of the Rings. The rest (delaying death for mortals; invisibility; sight into the Unseen Realm) are secondary effects of the primary power, which is the ability to cause reality to conform to your will."
tolkienfans,3dq8fa,EricKei,2,Sat Jul 18 17:42:08 2015 UTC,"I really like this idea :) I'm looking forward to see how the final paper turns out, if you're allowed to share it here!   Gollum without a doubt is a fascinating character. Since he is/was somewhat related to Hobbits, I will agree in my argumention that he shares the characteristics of Hobbits and is accepted as one.   Just as a point of order: Whatever he has become, he literally used to be a hobbit; he's not merely ""related"" to them. He was greedy and selfish even then, but he was born a hobbit and became...something else...over the centuries that the Ring exercised its influence over him."
tolkienfans,3dq8fa,rexbarbarorum,3,Sat Jul 18 14:58:14 2015 UTC,"Good you cleared that out! I need to research him a bit more, but is there clear reference to him being a greedy and selfish hobbit even before the temptation of the Ring? One could definitely assume so, since the Ring (perhaps) only empowers and twists the already existing characteristics in us.   I would like to have some opinion on what I said of Smeagol; instead of doing what more powerful figures would have done, which is used the ring for their own good by subordinating and controlling others (both human and non-human), he decided to go into hiding. I find this rather peculiar and in discussing the topic with friends have noted: ""Wasn't Smeagol a rather good Ring-bearer?"" . Other characters while visioning the Ring for themselves immediately thought of gaining power and starting substantial plans for their own good. But Smeagol was rather humble, went into hiding and killed fish while being invisible?   Of course we can say to this that eventually The Dark Lord would have called Smeagol/Gollum out of his hiding to him and taken the ring, but as a play of minds I think it it guite working! Another critique to this is the inevitable progress of the story: Tolkien had to work his way backwards when writing The Lord of the Rings and Gollum had had the Ring in the Hobbit etc. But nonetheless, I will argue in my thesis that the  fact that he used it rather humbly is due him being a Hobbit who knows now of great power, but of sustainability.  Thanks for the answer!"
tolkienfans,3dq8fa,UnderArch,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:14:01 2015 UTC,"I always got the impression that Smeagol went into hiding more or less because he was either no longer welcome among the other hobbits, or else simply placed himself into a self-imposed exile. I am unsure whether the murder he committed (his cousin, Deagol) to get it was because of the influence of the ring itself, though I can certainly see it amplifying his existing baser urges. There is certainly precedent for hobbits being...well...greedy jackasses. It always seemed to me that Smeagol was already an extreme case even before the Ring showed itself.   e.g.: Bilbo's relatives, the Sackville-Bagginses, who decided to help themselves to half of his possessions not long after he left the Shire in The Hobbit.  IIRC - and please correct me on this one -- but I believe Hobbits are genetically related to humans; they're just shorter, not warlike, and more provincial/hidebound. This suggests that they are susceptible to many of humanity's (aka The Race of Men's) foibles.  I'm sure others here can give you a better answer on this one -_-  This may be a good place to start -- though, as with any wiki, it's a jumping-off point, and not, in and of itself, a source."
tolkienfans,3dq8fa,friedstuffedolives,3,Sat Jul 18 19:58:44 2015 UTC,"Oh, and about sharing the thesis here: utmost certainly I will! But only after the University has approved, passed and published it!"
tolkienfans,3dq8fa,NightPhoenix35,2,Sat Jul 18 15:17:59 2015 UTC,"I actually would argue the opposite: the hobbits are not the way they are because they live in harmony with nature; they live in harmony in nature because they have little to no desire for power. Thus they live relatively natural lives, because they don't really want to subdue the earth for their desires.  This is seen most prominently in the Ring's general impotence when tempting hobbits. The one person the Ring has no power over, Bombadil, lives in complete harmony with nature.  Contrast this with those most susceptible to lust for power, like Saruman and Sauron, who literally destroy the natural world around them and make it sterile - metal and stone.  And when we look at Lotho, one of the few hobbits who has a lust for power, you can see the same thing: he transforms (with Saruman and the ruffians' help, of course) the Shire into an industrialized region not at all in harmony with nature.  I wrote this kind of quickly, but I think that you've essentially got things backwards.  Tolkien, I don't think, would hold a Deep Ecological view - like most Christians, he would have believed that humanity is the most important part of creation. His beef with the Machine and industrialization is that it destroys nature, which is a beautiful gift from God that we shouldn't spoil; and that it basically dehumanizes people, making them cogs in an assembly line (see the Orcs, for example, who are practically reduced to numbers in Sauron's army)."
tolkienfans,3dq8fa,NightPhoenix35,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:00:38 2015 UTC,"This to me seems a two-way train, doesn't it? They are necessary conditions for each other, but not so that the other is in a dominant precursory position in relation to the other? Hen, egg; egg, hen and so forth.  I understand the order of being and becoming here since Tolkien was a Catholic himself, and thus believed in creation (and therefore purposeful creation). If I understand your line of argumentation correctly, you mean to say that Hobbits were created without the desire to subdue the earth for their own goods and therefore naturally lived in harmony with nature since they knew of no other way (being created withour the desire for power..). Still I don't see why I couldn't be the other way around.  As I said, to me this seems a two-way train. It could also be that Hobbits learned to live with nature in relatively harmonious ways and therefore were resilient to dominance. Or, if you would like to say it in a more religious way, they learned to live in harmony with nature which then embarked the flame of sustainable life, resistance to power etc. innate in them. Like a light built in that was only waiting to be switched on.  You might've gotten it right though, I have to ponder on this while I sleep, I am superbly tired right now. It would however indeed seem more reasonable that Sauron, for example, who wasn't all for subordination and dominance at first was first corrupted by power and therefore stopped caring for things that grow etc. and put his mind on metal and wheels. Because the other way around would be quite silly: Sauron started to cut down trees in furious anger and suddenly realises he has a lust for power. So good point, thank you for it!  However, I would still argue that Tolkien was at least partly a supporter for deep ecology (at least would have been if the term would have existed at his time). He wanted living and thinking beings to realise the wholeness of the world, and that a small act here can cause an avalance thousand miles away and therefore we should be respectful of all things fair. This can be seen in the various forms of things he shows respect to, and gives life to, such as trees (which he greatly loved and admired) and even mountains, all things from flora to fauna and beyond. There are a variety of races out of which Men are only one part (although the others have diminished come this age). I don't think Tolkien, at least in his mythology, places Man in the center of things. He might've thought that Man has the greatest power and responsibility, but this is not to say it is the most importan part of it all! It is a question of roles in the world, more than which one is in the center and which not. I think the speech which Gandalf  gives Denethor describes Tolkien's view of the role of Men as Stewards well:  ""..the rule of no realm is mine, neither Gondor nor any other, great or small. But all worthy things that are in peril as the world now stands, those are my care. And for my part, I shall not wholly fail of my task, though Gondor should perish, if anything passes through this night that can still gow fair or bear fruit and flower again in days to come. For I also am a steward. Did you not know?"" (p.758, 2004 edition).  Here Gandalf points out that even if all of Men shall perish, life will go on and that is what matters; not that humanity is of most importance. For if humanity, would be the most important part of creation, why would anything matter after humanity has ended?  Thank you for this point of view though, I will sleep on it and come back to it tomorrow!"
tolkienfans,3dq8fa,ReinierPersoon,2,Sat Jul 18 19:09:18 2015 UTC,"It is quite clear as you have noted that Tolkien held very strong views about the importance of nature. However, it would be well worth critiquing what kind of 'nature' Tolkien held dear. The countryside of northern England during the end of the 19th and early part of the 20th century (Tolkien's boyhood home and arguably what inspired the Shire) was anything but natural in the sense of being devoid (or mostly devoid) of human activity. Indeed every element of that landscape was (and still is) managed by humans and is a result of our activity.   Critiquing the simple nature/machine divide apparent in Tolkien's works (and those scholars who have discussed it) and looking at how Tolkien is actually comparing two very human modes of development (one more sympathetic and one more antithetical to nature, but both equally a result of anthropogenic activity) might take your analysis quite far."
tolkienfans,3dq8fa,ReinierPersoon,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:57:39 2015 UTC,"I think that an interesting angle to analyze would be the driving forces between different societies. Creation if  a key topic and it would be interesting to juxtapose the more Hobbity ideal to ""nurture creation"" through farming and such ....vs the darker side of wanting to create (such as creating the rings, Saruman creating an army.   More interesting still would be to place man and elf in this spectrum, as both also create. The elves create great things but closer in the spectrum to hobbits by still remaining in nature...while man also has a similar drive to create (great cities like Gondor and war machines) but stand a bit closer to the ""creation drive"" as Saruman.      Just a random thought ....go luck with it all"
tolkienfans,3dq8fa,theninjanipples,2,Sat Jul 18 13:11:02 2015 UTC,"Interesting indeed, however I have decided on my topic and will stick to it!  Tolkien definitely had a lot to say on creation. One particular letter comes to mind where he answers a bishop (if I remember correctly, perhaps a pries) and defends the primary omnipotent creation (Ilúvatar) together with sub-creation (maiar, elves, men etc.) when the bishop had claimed Tolkien went too far in giving sub-creators the power to create, when only the one God should have that ability. Tolkien replied that in his view Ilúvatar has the only power to truly create, which is to create something out of nothing and others merely copy his work. Very Christian indeed.  Hobbits, in my opinion, are more similar to stewards and nurturers of something that already has been created. So not creators per se. But I think you hit the gold vein in addressing the issue of 'evil' creation through machine and with intention of domination (Saruman and Sauron having the mind for metal and wheels, creating armies and machines). Tolkien himself saw this ""mind of a machine"" the ultimate failure of the modern world. Christopher explains some of it here (https://youtu.be/HkmNHP58OhU?t=9m17s). Before deciding to stick to Hobbits only, I also thought of comparing different races and their relation (and will) to power. Unfortunately that would be too much for a Bachelor's Thesis and its limitations, but perhaps a Master's Thesis will open the topic for me again!  I guess partly I will still be analyisng what you suggested; the nurture creation (and thus the love for things that grow, last and endure) and it's effect on why the Hobbits have such resilience towards power (the machine). Gandalf also seems to have the similar mind towards nurturing the world instead of commanding it. There is an excellent Master's Thesis on this subject by the name Deep Ecology and Stewardship in J.R.R. Tolkien’s Middle-earth by Petit, J. (2012) Faculty of Humanities, Utrecht University (http://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/251723). I will also be addressing this work in my thesis. Apologies if I remember incorrectly, but in this thesis the issue of Christian Stewardship was also raised, which is rather important when wrapping open Tolkiens mind and work.  Some criticism has been laid towards Tolkien's romantisized view on Hobbittian life as 'the good way of life'. But in my view literature is in its rightful place in serving perhaps even utopian models for the society. As one YouTube commetor once said: ”Tolkien gives us hope, he gives the world an old-fashioned imagination which it so desperately needs.”  Thanks for your interest and suggestion!"

I'm pretty sure Tolkien was a soldier himself, probably reminiscing of his home when times we're tough...it's probably a reflection of that sentiment.

Post-Ring Sauron, he was such a threat to all of Middle Earth that it took the combined effort of Men and Elves to take him down. To me that seems like a huge jump in power.

Also, had Fingolfin challenged Sauron, Sauron would have been done.  Fingolfin inflicted permanent damage on Morgoth, a Vala.  Imagine what would have happened to a Maia."

When Gandalf spoke, he could only speak of what he knows or belief. It is not certain that Gandalf is correct on all points. Because who really knows how Barad-Dûr was build except for Sauron himself? It is a possibility that they don't know exactly how or when Barad-Dûr was build.    That is the beauty of Middle-Earth I think, there are so much that aren't explained in the books, things which either only existed in Tolkien's mind or not at all.

It is possible some would come to his side, but I have to wonder if he would even need them - maybe some stout defenders, protected by the towers of the Morannon or Minas Morgul, would stand against him, but it is not beyond speculation that someone of his stature in possession of the Ring could, in fact, simply walk into Mordor."

It proved to be a bony, underfed, and dispirited animal; but it did not look like dying just yet. Mr. Butterbur paid for it himself, and offered Merry another eighteen pence as some compensation for the lost animals. He was an honest man, and well-off as things were reckoned in Bree; but thirty silver pennies was a sore blow to him, and being cheated by Bill Ferny made it harder to bear.   There's also an instance of Bilbo handing out pennies to the Hobbit children watching as Gandalf arrives in the Shire.

Perhaps they were still using old coins since the time of Arnor when they were nominally vassals to their king. Or perhaps the Thain issued coins every once in a while, though it's not mentioned as one of his tasks. There are also the Mayor, and the Masters of Buckland and the Mayor in Michel Delving.  In other places it would be easier. I guess they would just issue money in Dale/Laketown, Erebor, Gondor, Rohan etc. Or perhaps some of the more indepent cities would all have their own currency like in the middle ages.

tolkienfans,3dkf1j,ReinierPersoon,18,Fri Jul 17 00:18:47 2015 UTC,"Hah! I read this page last night.  What are the odds?  Anyway, here is an excerpt from page 147, in the chapter The King of the Golden Hall:   'Come, come!' said Gandalf. 'We are all friends here. Or should be; for the laughter of Mordor will be our only reward, if we quarrel. My errand is pressing. Here at least is my sword, goodman Hama. Keep it well. Glamdring it is called, for the Elves made it long ago. Now let me pass. Come, Aragorn!'"
tolkienfans,3dkf1j,dashenyang,3,Fri Jul 17 11:27:43 2015 UTC,Can I ask how people on here think he was able to re-obtain Nenya and Glamdring after dying?  Do we think he was just returned to his broken body on the mountainside?
tolkienfans,3dkf1j,hankbaumbach,4,Fri Jul 17 16:20:49 2015 UTC,"Do we think he was just returned to his broken body on the mountainside?   We know that.    Naked I was sent back - for a brief time, until my task is done. And naked I lay upon the mountain-top. The tower behind was crumbled into dust, the window gone; the ruined stair was choked with burned and broken stone. I was alone, forgotten, without escape upon the hard horn of the world..."
tolkienfans,3dkf1j,HannasAnarion,2,Sat Jul 18 00:26:53 2015 UTC,"See that seems to imply his original body was either changed (as he was clothed when he died and armed), disappeared and a new one replaced it or at one point there were two bodies of Gandalf, one dead with all his old stuff and one naked on the mountain top."
tolkienfans,3dkf1j,hankbaumbach,2,Mon Jul 20 22:43:41 2015 UTC,"Either way, there is no doubt that Gandalf resurrection happened on the mountaintop, at the same location that he died. Even if he did get a new body, he could have just picked up the sword from his old one before flying away."

tolkienfans,3dkf1j,greenwizardneedsfood,3,Fri Jul 17 01:47:53 2015 UTC,"I've always been a bit annoyed about the fate of orcrist. Thorin had this sword that is many thousands of years old for a matter of months, and it gets buried with him. Surely it could have been of better use in battle."
tolkienfans,3dkf1j,probablydurnk,4,Fri Jul 17 14:05:23 2015 UTC,"It was put on his grave, not in it. It was the Arkenstone that was buried with him. Bard lays the Arkenstone on his chest as part of the deal that their people would get their fourteenth share of the treasure.  The Elvenking laid the sword on Thorin's tomb. It says it would gleam whenever Orcs were near and that the Lonely Mountain could never be taken by surprise. So in a sense it is useful. Also pretty generous of the Elvenking as he could have kept it."
tolkienfans,3dkf1j,ReinierPersoon,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:12:13 2015 UTC,"On or in, I don't think anyone is going to take it and start using it. The Lonely Mountain could still be taken by surprise, just with men or some other non-orc being. I agree that it's quite generous of the Elvenking, but I personally just don't feel that Thorin really earned the right to have it laid on his tomb. He didn't do anything of note with the sword, nor did he carry it for a long time."
tolkienfans,3dkf1j,probablydurnk,3,Fri Jul 17 14:31:07 2015 UTC,"There wasn't really anyone else who had a claim to it as far as I know. Most Noldor of Gondolin are probably gone so it was finder's keepers.  The Elvenking also had no real claim as he is likely not any relation to the people of Gondolin. I don't think this was all thought out when the Hobbit was written but Thranduil is supposed to come from Doriath were they had little love for the Noldor. I'm not sure but I think it's likely the sword was made by the Noldor as they were known for such things.  Thranduil only took it away to disarm them when he imprisoned them. He would let Thorin and company go if they told him about the quest. I assume he would have been given back the sword then too. Book-Elvenking is not a nasty person, just not one to trust strangers easily."
tolkienfans,3dkf1j,ReinierPersoon,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:39:47 2015 UTC,"I agree with what you're saying, but I personally think that pretty much anyone in all of middle earth could have laid equal claim to the sword as Thorin (found it in a cave and had it for a few months), and it would have been put to better use in the world and more likely passed to someone of worthiness. It's just something that's always bugged me."
tolkienfans,3dkf1j,probablydurnk,3,Fri Jul 17 15:40:37 2015 UTC,"I think the sword has fulfilled its purpose in the story. As you said Thorin hasn't used it much but now it is used to mend relations between the Mirkwood Elves and the Dwarves, and the sword makes it so Orcs cannot approach unnoticed.  Upon his tomb the Elvenking then laid Orcrist, the elvish sword that had been taken from Thorin in captivity. It is said in songs that it gleamed ever in the dark if foes approached, and the fortress of the dwarves could not be taken by surprise.""  And everyone is giving gifts. The Eagles get a reward in gold, Bard gives the Arkenstone back, and even Bilbo gives a necklace to the Elvenking for all the food and wine he stole and is then named elf-friend. One of the themes in all the books is letting go of objects. People who want hold on to something often end up dead (the Noldor and the Silmarils, Thingol, Gollum, Boromir, the Master of Laketown and Thorin of course). People are often judged by whether they are generous or greedy."
tolkienfans,3difg3,JManSenior918,14,Thu Jul 16 15:05:11 2015 UTC,"It says the work was previously unknown, but then says it was first published in 2010. huh?  Interesting none the less, thanks for the news!"
tolkienfans,3difg3,PrivateChicken,9,Thu Jul 16 15:17:18 2015 UTC,My understanding is that when this was first published it was incomplete and part of a collection of other works. Now it seems that Verlyn Flieger has used Tolkien's notes and such to complete the book and will be publishing it on it's own.  I could be wrong though.
tolkienfans,3difg3,ebneter,8,Thu Jul 16 15:22:18 2015 UTC,"It was first published in Tolkien Studies Vol. VII, 2010, edited by Verlyn Flieger, but only the completed version and some notes on Kullervo by Tolkien. I would guess that the new edition looks at the manuscript history as well as adding more commentary and other ancillary material — and providing it to a much larger audience, of course. I am very much looking forward to it even though I have a copy of the 2010 version."
tolkienfans,3difg3,EricIO,4,Thu Jul 16 16:10:15 2015 UTC,"I'm giving the 2010 version a read now, I will surely get this version also. It looks beautiful.  By the way I found this little passage that seemed a bit familiar:    and to Kullervo he gave three hairs from his coat and said, “Kullervo Kalervanpoika, if ever you are in danger from Unto take one of these and cry ‘Musti O! Musti may thy magic aid me now’, then wilt thou find a marvellous aid in thy distress.”   The giving of three hairs of course makes me think of Galadriels gift to Gimli. But taking what Musti says I immediately thought of both the Phial of Galadriel and the song that Tom Bombadil teaches the hobbits. Now back to reading."
tolkienfans,3difg3,grapesandmilk,6,Thu Jul 16 17:43:22 2015 UTC,"I wonder when we'll get ""previously unknown Tolkien work coming out"" news for the last time. It's always strange imagining how something seems so new when it's been around for a long time. A hundred and one years!"

I mean, I love what Chris has done for his father, but I'd really like to see the original papers as they are. That'd be amazing."
tolkienfans,3difg3,magradhaid,5,Fri Jul 17 03:09:34 2015 UTC,"This has no chance at all of happening (especially public domain, for free), and even if it did, a good amount of the documents would be illegible to those who haven't learned to read Tolkien's handwriting (for some of which ""decipher"" might be more appropriate). Even once some had adapted after long study to be better at this, there would still be misreadings: Christopher Tolkien misread some Elvish forms for Etymologies in HoME5, and a few of the later corrections by the Editorial Team in VT45-6 were afterwards amended as well. More importantly, we'd also get no editorial commentary to help with context or dating. I'd be interested in placing the manuscripts in their proper context, and I'm not sure that crowdsourcing alone would be able to achieve this, especially with documents with multiple layers of heavy revision.  Sure, I'd like to know the full contents of works and notes only quoted or alluded to, and it's nice to see more of Tolkien's handwriting, but I don't think the lack of context and commentary is a good idea. If only Christopher Tolkien and other certain scholars are aware of (for example) what implications the usage of certain writing implements (green ballpoint pen, for example, as mentioned in certain commentary) and certain kinds of paper has for dating manuscripts, I'd like to see their commentary.  Sure, there would be something to be said for everyone looking at the database to be able to discuss and analyze the manuscripts, but I think a complete lack of editorial commentary would be a mistake.  There are also documents the Estate is unlikely to release, at least in the foreseeable future: Tolkien's diaries, for instance, which were commonly written in his (various) invented scripts, but dealing with personal and emotional matters."

tolkienfans,3dikqh,ebneter,4,Thu Jul 16 16:13:20 2015 UTC,Interesting. That's a big challenge. Has he given any interviews anywhere or talked about it?
tolkienfans,3dikqh,ebneter,7,Thu Jul 16 20:21:49 2015 UTC,"No, both Christopher and Adam seldom give interviews, although Adam did do some around the time of the publication of Beowulf.

I'm just curious to see what different personalities, without Christopher looming so large, will do/say."
tolkienfans,3dikqh,dMage,2,Thu Jul 16 20:18:20 2015 UTC,Presumably Christopher wouldn't appoint a new literary executor (and trustees) with vastly different opinions on future licensing.

tolkienfans,3dikqh,jlebowski316,14,Fri Jul 17 02:35:01 2015 UTC,"Well the copyright on the Hobbit runs out in 2032. Christopher Tolkien will likely die before then (though it is possible he will live until he is 108) however his son Adam will likely take over.  Adam is currently 46 and the average life expectancy of a male french citizen is 78.5 so Adam has an estimated 32.5 years left (a little morbid) however if we average this out with his dads current age of ninety we get a better estimate of 38.25 years left.  This means that before Adam's death, all Tolkien's works which were published prior to 1958 (This includes The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings) will be in the public domain.  So even if Adam takes over, soon enough there won't be much buisness left as the 4 most successful books of the franchise will be in the public domain."

The current standard revised text for The Lord of The Rings was first published in 1994, so that version will be under copyright in the U.S. until 2089.

tolkienfans,3dikqh,Evan_Th,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:23:58 2015 UTC,"Yes, but more importantly the characters will be in the public domain, so the Tolkien Estate can't sue you for selling Bilbo merchandise or writing stories about him. Isn't that so?"
tolkienfans,3dikqh,jrrtolkiennerd,4,Thu Jul 16 23:25:19 2015 UTC,Not unless your stories contain material or character traits only found in the revised editions.  Those would remain under copyright until the revised editions themselves go into the public domain.
tolkienfans,3dikqh,Connor6,8,Thu Jul 16 23:33:14 2015 UTC,"So basically copyright law (at least in the U.S.) works like this:  Anything published/made is protected by copyright, meaning the original creator or owner of the copyright controls who can copy that thing. If the owner gives permission (usually done for a sum of money) another person or entity (like a movie studio), may use the copyrighted content of that thing in another thing. i.e. an author sells the film copy rights of their novel exclusively to a film studio, and that studio adapts that thing into a film. This is called private domain.  After a certain point a work's copyright expires for the owner, and essentially everyone in the public sphere then owns it and may legally adapt the material - why you see so many new adaptations of Sherlock Holmes and Jane Austen novels. This is called the public domain.  Now, when something enters the public domain is a tricky question because copyright laws have changed over time, often with an extension of the private domain periods. It breaks down like this.   pre-1922: it's currently in the public domain 1923-1977: If copyright is renewed by the author/executor of state, a maximum of 95 years 1978-1998: Lifetime of the last surviving author + 50 years 1998-current law: Lifetime of the last surviving author + 70 years   Meaning, the breakdown for when JRRT/CT's major works enter public domain are:   The Hobbit (1937): 2032 The Lord of the Rings (1954-55): 2049-2050 The Silmarillion (1977): 2072 All subsequent works, whenever CT (when he is the sole individual ""author"" or personal owner of the copyright) passes away + 50/70 years.   Now, this is when these works enter the public domain and the permission of the Tolkien Estate to use them in, say, a film adaptation, will not matter. When CT passes, it may be the case that Adam Tolkien (who helped a lot with the publication of The Children of Hurin) takes over the main running of the Estate and decides to sell the film rights to a studio. But either way, these are the dates for public domain in the U.S.  Also, a disclaimer, (as I've been misinterpreted elsewheres on the internet before) - I don't think I or anyone on here is currently calling for CT to pass away sooner so the copyrights become available. We owe him so much as a fandom and I completely respect his decision not to sell the copyright."
tolkienfans,3dikqh,jrrtolkiennerd,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:49:46 2015 UTC,"Also, (I apologize for the separate comment) you mentioned that these laws and regulations only pertain to the US. How does it work in other countries? What if, instead of the 95 year maximum, the copyright for The Hobbit in the UK (for example) was only a 80 year maximum? Could that material enter public domain in the UK in 2017?"
tolkienfans,3dikqh,Connor6,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:35:16 2015 UTC,"It depends on the country and can vary between each depending on their laws.   In the U.K. for example, originally it was the lifetime of the author + 50 years for anything published after 1911 - but since then in 1995 they retroactively altered lapsed and existing copyright so that anything published since 1925 is the author's lifetime + 70 years (from the start date of 1996, or 1988 if that grants the work longer protection, even if the author had died before either date), meaning The Hobbit won't enter the public domain in the U.K. until 2066.  But the U.S. copyright law mainly matters for a film adaptation because it's where most of the major film companies in the world are based, and so their usage of materials and any materials publication fall under U.S. laws. This also pertains to different publishers rights and so authors often have different publishers depending on the country - why Tolkien's works are published under Unwin/Allen in the U.K. but Houghton Mifflin in the U.S."

tolkienfans,3dikqh,Uluithiad,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:50:03 2015 UTC,"I have read that Christopher Tolkien has held a strong disdain to the film adaptions to The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. After reading your comment, I understand that the only way anyone could adapt the material in these major works to the big screen would be with permission/rights from Christopher Tolkien. Well, why would CT allow The Hobbit to be adapted if he had/has such a negative opinion on the LoTR films?"
tolkienfans,3dikqh,jrrtolkiennerd,7,Fri Jul 17 03:27:01 2015 UTC,He didn't. The rights were sold back when Tolkien was still around.
tolkienfans,3dikqh,Connor6,7,Fri Jul 17 04:01:35 2015 UTC,"The film rights to both The Hobbit and LotR were sold by JRRT during his lifetime and so where never held by The Tolkien Estate - he basically let them go for relatively nothing because he knew that making a live action version at the time would have been next to impossible. And given that it took technology nearly 40 years to catch up enough to manage it he seems to have been well justified in the decision.  CT doesn't have much love for the films - essentially he felt that they are watered down versions of his father's stories that didn't touch on a lot of the deeper themes found in the books. To some extent I agree, however I think the films also increased readership of the books themselves and a furtherance of interest in Tolkien."
tolkienfans,3dikqh,jrrtolkiennerd,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:32:36 2015 UTC,"Again thank you for the reply, that's interesting. Granted Tolkien knew that making a film would be very unlikely, still, why do you think he would sell the rights knowing potentially a film could be made down the line (whether it be 40 years, 50 years, etc.) and all for next to nothing?"
tolkienfans,3dikqh,ebneter,4,Fri Jul 17 12:54:09 2015 UTC,"Mainly it was for having money for retirement purposes to United Artists in 1968. But he knew the book was impossible, at the time, to practically film. That same year he gave an interview with the BBC and said ""You can’t cramp narrative into dramatic form. It would be easier to film The Odyssey. Much less happens in it. Only a few storms.” So Tolkien probably felt the film rights weren't worth all that much.  But also, I think it came back to pragmatism. At the time he was 76, and one isn't going to live forever (he would die five years later). Once you're dead, you probably don't care that much about the copyright status of your works or how much money they make."
tolkienfans,3dikqh,magradhaid,4,Fri Jul 17 16:00:49 2015 UTC,"Mainly it was for having money for retirement purposes   Actually, it was to pay a tax bill. England's taxes at the time were pretty punishing."

tolkienfans,3dicqa,Iaconacoalsaurus,56,Thu Jul 16 14:44:24 2015 UTC,"Interestingly, Tolkien directly discusses ""Morgoth's Ring"" in the History of Middle Earth volume 10 entitled Morgoth's Ring  Here's the most relevant quote:  ""Just as Sauron concentrated his power in the One Ring, Morgoth dispersed his power into the very matter of Arda, thus 'the whole of Middle-earth was Morgoth's Ring""  Thus while Sauron persisted as long as the ring existed I imagine Morgoth with persist as long as the world exists.     Given the fact Morgoth dispersed his power while Sauron concentrated his power, I imagine Morgoth might be able to use Sauron's ring as a tool/weapon even though it might not be as powerful as Morgoth overall.   This would be kinda analogous to a huge giant (morgoth) using a hand-gun(the ring) that was originally designed for a normal man(sauron)...maybe..."

tolkienfans,3dicqa,GrimnirOdinson,16,Fri Jul 17 05:42:48 2015 UTC,"What we know of the Rings in general is vague in terms of what ""increasing power"" means but it's certainly possible that he might gain some benefit from wearing it. I think at the least it's probable that he'd be able to wrest ""ownership"" of it from Sauron and he'd get the benefit of the link to other Ring-bearers.  Morgoth's desire to destroy everything that wasn't of his creation (i.e. everything) isn't terribly compatible with the Ring's purpose (dominating the minds of others and the basic Ring power of preservation), but at least in terms of keeping his slaves in line I can see it being useful."
tolkienfans,3dicqa,WalkingTarget,6,Thu Jul 16 14:56:22 2015 UTC,"A latter book in the ""History of Middle Earth"" series, is called ""Morgoth's Ring"", and we see a lot of these power themes flushed out, and strong analogies and comparisons to Sauron's One Ring.    Essentially all of Arda is Morgoths 'ring', and he disperses his power into it, whereas Sauron concentrated his power into the One Ring."
tolkienfans,3dicqa,Mycd,4,Thu Jul 16 16:38:07 2015 UTC,"In some way, the way to look at it may be in a different order.    Morgoth's domination of the physical world in its entirety may have birthed the possibility of the Ring and its commanding qualities.  The Rings of Power played on the fears/desires of the various races and twisted them- in the Elves' case, the Three changed actual regions of the physical world in a manner they  decidedly should not have been, naturally.    All of said rings, even the Three, are ultimately subject to the One, and that should set off warning bells as to what their nature truly is.  Anyway, it seems likely to me that the beginning factor allowing the One to do so is the existence and power of the already present Morgoth-essence in the physical world.    Basically, the Morgoth essence is bad news.  It allows any number of bad things to happen, most of them involving twisting and perverting the ""natural"" history of the sentient races."
tolkienfans,3dicqa,TemporalOasis,5,Thu Jul 16 19:57:06 2015 UTC,"Sauron's power was not (for example) in gold as such, but in a particular form or shape made of a particular portion of total gold. Morgoth's power was disseminated throughout Gold, if nowhere absolute (for he did not create Gold) it was nowhere absent. (It was this Morgoth-element in matter, indeed, which was a prerequisite for such 'magic' and other evils as Sauron practised with it and upon it.) It is quite possible, of course, that certain 'elements' or conditions of matter had attracted Morgoth's special attention (mainly, unless in the remote past, for reasons of his own plans). For example, all gold (in Middle-earth) seems to have had a specially 'evil' trend - but not silver. Water is represented as being almost entirely free of Morgoth. (This, of course, does not mean that any particular sea, stream, river, well, or even vessel of water could not be poisoned or defiled - as all things could.)   -Morgoth's Ring, 'Myths Transformed', Text VII, (ii)  Or, in short, quite."

tolkienfans,3dicqa,TemporalOasis,2,Fri Jul 17 15:24:26 2015 UTC,The ring would probably be pointless compared to his own inherent power. It would be similar to how tom bombadil regards it a merely a trinket
tolkienfans,3dicqa,Findies_Keepies,2,Fri Jul 17 04:23:54 2015 UTC,Yeah I always imagined Morgoth simply crushing the ring in his hand.

tolkienfans,3df1vf,Kiltmanenator,11,Thu Jul 16 06:09:01 2015 UTC,"Hey! You're in luck, I actually made a post in this sub about this :)  https://www.reddit.com/r/tolkienfans/comments/346x9u/the_hobbit_and_the_shoggoth_why_lovecraft_now_a/?ref=search_posts   Despite these contrasting biographies, the two had more in common than often is supposed. Both lost fathers at early ages, both had mothers who were enormously influential on their lives, and both grew up in genteel poverty. Both also relied heavily on informal circles of like-minded writers for support and inspiration, Lovecraft on his Circle and Tolkien on the Inklings; both drew much of their fiction from their knowledge of other academic disciplines, Lovecraft from astronomy and Tolkien from philology; and both offered impressive scholarly defenses of their genres, Lovecraft with “Supernatural Horror in Literature” (1927, revised in 1933) and Tolkien with “On Fairy-Stories” (1947). What is not as easily recognized, and is in fact far more important, is that behind the Shoggoths and Hobbits that people their tales, both men were consumed by several of the same concerns.  ...  In short, both Lovecraft and Tolkien were on a quest for something permanent, meaningful, and binding in a changing modern world, fueled by a desire for identity and community in a time in which they felt displaced and marginalized, and a thirst for structure and civilization in the face of what they saw as entropy and barbarism. Paradoxically, these concerns, while isolating each author to a certain degree, also made Lovecraft and Tolkien exemplars of their age, men of remarkable insight and sensitivity who articulated the concerns of an entire era with unusual eloquence and urgency.  But there the similarity ends. The paths of the two diverged, one in the direction of faith and hope, and the other in the direction of science and hopelessness."

It was dimly lit with torches flaring in brackets on the walls, but its distant end was lost in gloom. Many doors and openings could be seen on this side and that; but it was empty save for two or three more bodies sprawling on the floor. From what he had heard of the captains' talk Sam knew that, dead or alive, Frodo would most likely be found in a chamber high up in the turret far above; but he might search for a day before he found the way.  'It'll be near the back, I guess,' Sam muttered. 'The whole Tower climbs backwards-like. And anyway I'd better follow these lights.'   It's not referring to a particular orientation of the stairs being opposite of the normal way. Indeed I'm not sure what the ""normal orientation"" for a stairway would be. It's simply referring to the tower's design. It steps up in tiers back away toward the mountain behind. It's clear from a few other passages as well talking about the tower rising ""in tiers"" but take a look at this illustration to get a general idea.  Going back the quoted passage you can get the idea as well. The main passage ""led back...towards the mountain-side."" Sam guesses the stairway will be ""near the back"" and that he should ""follow the lights"" of the main passage leading toward the back of the tower. When he says the Tower ""climbs backwards-like"" he's simply referring to it's overall design of climbing up and back (rather than straight up, or up and out), not the stairway in particular."
tolkienfans,3di5xn,EyeceEyeceBaby,6,Thu Jul 16 15:08:12 2015 UTC,That makes sense.  Thanks.  Stairs in castles (from what I understand) usually spiral in a certain direction to give the defenders the advantage (most people being right handed)  For some reason I could have sworn it was mentioned that the actual stairs climbed the opposite direction--giving Sam and the viewer/reader an uneasy sense about the place.  I've read that somewhere....guess it just wasn't Tolkien  Thanks for your response!
tolkienfans,3di5xn,EyeceEyeceBaby,5,Thu Jul 16 15:15:30 2015 UTC,"Ah yes I do recall that hearing that before. It had to do with giving right-handed defenders an advantage when descending stairs (giving them room to swing a sword) against right-handed attackers ascending stairs without room to swing. It would certainly be a cool connection, but I don't think that's what Sam was referring to.  Edit: Also you weren't off with Sam having an uneasy feeling. The uneasy feeling was from the realization that the tower was meant to keep people in, not to defend the pass from Gondor. It was built by Gondor to keep watch on Mordor, and still in use by Sauron to prevent his slaves from escaping."
tolkienfans,3di5xn,ReinierPersoon,2,Thu Jul 16 15:22:43 2015 UTC,"I heard the story that a clan of mostly left-handed Scotsmen built their towers the other way around since they were mostly left-handed. Not sure if it's true or that they just built the towers the ""wrong"" way because they didn't really think of it.  As for Sam, it may very well be the first time Sam has even been in a tower, and he may never have seen stairs that go back and forth or in circles (except perhaps in Moria or Lothlórien).

S.A. 1731–1869) was the eleventh ruler of Númenor. He was the son of Isilmo and succeeded his aunt, Queen Tar-Telperiën, when she died. He was the grandson of King Tar-Súrion. His name means ""Tower-watcher"", which perhaps signifies ""The Vigilant"". Sauron invaded Eriador from Calenardhon in S.A. 1695 and realms of Eregion fell. Sauron advanced to Lindon and Rivendell. In S.A. 1700 Tar-Minastir sent a navy under the command of Ciryatur, to save Lindon. Ciryatur's forces stopped Sauron's army at the river Gwathló; reinforcements from Lindon and Tharbad helped defeat Sauron at the Battle of Gwathló. Sauron retreated to Mordor in S.A. 1701. From around the 19th century in the S.A., Númenóreans began establishing permanent settlements in Middle-earth, including Umbar.

Why are they probably hidden away? Because we do not see specific female orcs presented before us? Given the disparity between named male and female characters in Tolkien's writing, and their page presence, this isn't exactly unexpected.  Why is it likely they are much smaller than male orcs? Or more wretched? Why is it likely they have animalistic harems? Wouldn't it just be as in line with Morgoth's hatred to try and get Orcs into a wretched, hellish, bitter monogamy or series of monogamies, as to reduce the reproduction of thinking beings to that of (some) beasts?"

In the Silmarillion it says that Orcs (including Goblins, Uruks, Uruk-hai etc) are Elves corrupted and ruined by Morgoth. Tolkien reportedly hasn't settled on an origin theory for the Orcs but that is the one they chose for the Silmarillion. The whole work was in flux until his death.  If we go with this origin story then the Orcs would pretty much reproduce like Elves and Men would. It is mentioned in the Hobbit that Bolg is the son of Azog, and if they reproduce like humans there would have been a mother. There isn't really any mention of female Orcs, but then there aren't that many females in the stories anyway. The Orcs may also have been long-lived as there was a long time between Azog getting killed and Bolg attacking Erebor.  There is an explanation for why we don't really see Dwarf women: their women have beards and look similar to men in the eyes of outsiders, and there are much fewer women than men among Dwarves."

Sauron has a body (Tolkien describes it in Letters as the shape of a Man's, larger, but not gigantic) and a Palantir which he uses to see great distances.  ""The Eye"" is his heraldic symbol and the name for the power of his will to dominate over others. The ""Eye"" as a power and term for Sauron himself predates his defeat in the Last Alliance as well.    He also doesn't allow use of the name ""Sauron"" by his servants, which is why they almost exclusively refer to him as ""The Eye"" or ""The Great Eye""."

RotK mentions ""the cruel pinnacles and iron crown of the topmost tower of Barad-dûr. One moment only it stared out, but as from some great window immeasurably high there stabbed northward a flame of red, the flicker of a piercing Eye"" (Mount Doom).  Some (Foster, etc.) have speculated that the Window is on the west side (but could see in other directions) because the entrance to the Sammath Naur on Orodruin ""gazed back east straight to the Window of the Eye in Sauron's shadow-mantled fortress"". However, if the Window were on the top, presumably it would be able to see said entrance on the west - as well as other directions.

Either way I was apparently wrong according to /u/Uluithiad , but I felt I needed to say this."

tolkienfans,3ddax2,Personn,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:52:09 2015 UTC,"As clarification for anyone who is sat there thinking ""Palantír, I am sure I have heard that word somewhere."", A palantír is a magical artifact which allows you to see events happening elsewhere.  For example... I have a monitor and a security camera. I can transport the security camera anywhere I wish to view the current events happening there. I then make the security camera invisible and replace my monitor with a palantír.  *Don't take the last paragraph to literally, I wrote it just so people were able to visualise what the object does."""
tolkienfans,3ddax2,NoteTypical,33,Wed Jul 15 18:50:48 2015 UTC,"I do believe that Sauron's capability to see far is due to his possession of the Stone of Minas Ithil (a palantír). Whether or not this is related to his heraldic device of a flaming eye (which he also may use as his form when ""talking"" thru the palantír, e.g. to Denethor, Saruman, Pippin and Aragorn) I don't know.  As mentioned by /u/ToffeeKing, Gollum mentioned a hand, so assumably the Dark Lord has a conventional body. (I have to note, even in the War of the Last Alliance, while wielding the Ring, Sauron came out of Barad-Dûr as the last resort after ten years of siege, so Sauron not leaving his tower is nothing extraordinary.)"

tolkienfans,3ddax2,deanzamo,17,Wed Jul 15 16:23:21 2015 UTC,"Well, there are allusions to Sauron having an eye in the books.  As with much of Tolkiens writing, he leaves this as kind of ambiguous, leaving it up to the reader to imagine. I gathered up some quotes from the books that describe Sauron's Eye.  I don't have time to format it better or go into more detail, but it's interesting to read.   The manifestation of Sauron having a fiery cats eye happens at the Mirror Galadriel:   But suddenly the Mirror went altogether dark, as dark as if a hole had opened in the world of sight, and Frodo looked into emptiness. In the black abyss there appeared a single Eye that slowly grew. until it filled nearly all the Mirror. So terrible was it that Frodo stood rooted, unable to cry out or to withdraw his gaze. The Eye was rimmed with fire, but was itself glazed, yellow as a cat's, watchful and intent, and the black slit of its pupil opened on a pit, a window into nothing.   This is the first reference to ""The Eye"" in the books.  Also interesting, ""The Eye"" doesn't get referred to as Lidless until The Return of the King:  Chapter: Seige of Gondor:   They were grim to look on; for though some were crushed and shapeless, and some had been cruelly hewn, yet many had features that could be told, and it seemed that they had died in pain; and all were branded with the foul token of the Lidless Eye.   Chapter: Seige of Pellenor Fields:   A cold voice answered: ‘Come not between the Nazgûl and his prey! Or he will not slay thee in thy turn. He will bear thee away to the houses of lamentation, beyond all darkness, where thy flesh shall be devoured, and thy shrivelled mind be left naked to the Lidless Eye.   Now, back to the Fellowship of the Ring, when the Fellowship breaks at the end Frodo encounters The Eye:   And suddenly he felt the Eye. There was an eye in the Dark Tower that did not sleep. He knew that it had become aware of his gaze. A fierce eager will was there. It leaped towards him; almost like a finger he felt it, searching for him. Very soon it would nail him down, know just exactly where he was. Amon Lhaw it touched. It glanced upon Tol Brandir he threw himself from the seat, crouching, covering his head with his grey hood.   Two Towers, Chapter 3:   'Is Saruman the master or the Great Eye?' said the evil voice. 'We should go back at once to Lugbúrz.'  Saruman is a fool. and a dirty treacherous fool. But the Great Eye is on him.  long-armed crook-legged Orcs. They had a red eye painted on their shields. Uglúk stepped forward to meet them.   One day you'll wish that you had not said that. Ape!' he snarled fiercely. 'You ought to know that they're the apple of the Great Eye.  said Gandalf .... ' but I did not speak, for I was heavy with thought, and weary after my struggle with the Eye of Mordor; and he did not speak either, nor call my name.'     Chapter 9   'All this about the Orcs of Barad-dûr, Lugbúrz as they call it, makes me uneasy,' said Aragorn. 'The Dark Lord already knew too much and his servants also; and Grishnákh evidently sent some message across the River after the quarrel. The Red Eye will be looking towards Isengard. But Saruman at any rate is in a cleft stick of his own cutting.'   Chapter 10   'Reasons for leaving you can see from your windows.' answered Gandalf. 'Others will occur to your thought. Your servants are destroyed and scattered; your neighbours you have made your enemies; and you have cheated your new master. or tried to do so. When his eye turns hither, it will be the red eye of wrath.  Yes, we have won, but only the first victor and that in itself increases our danger. There was some link between Isengard and Mordor, which I have not yet fathomed. How they exchanged news I am not sure; but they did so. The Eye of Barad-dûr will be looking impatiently towards the Wizard's Vale, I think; and towards Rohan. The less it sees the better.'  (Gandalf Speaking)   When Pippin looks into the Palantir there is the hint that the Saurons eye is fiery:   Pippin sat with his knees drawn up and the ball between them. He bent low over it, looking like a greedy child stooping over a bowl of food, in a corner away from others. He drew his cloak aside and gazed at it. The air seemed still and tense about him. At first the globe was dark, black as jet, with the moonlight gleaming on its surface. Then there came a faint glow and stir in the heart of it, and it held his eyes, so that now he could not look away. Soon all the inside seemed on fire; the ball was spinning, or the lights within were revolving. Suddenly the lights went out. He gave a gasp and struggled; but he remained bent, clasping the ball with both hands. Closer and closer he bent, and then became rigid; his lips moved soundlessly for a while. Then with a strangled cry he fell back and lay still.   Book IV Chapter 1 Taming of Smeagol   'So do I,' said Frodo; 'but he's not my chief trouble. I wish we could get away from these hills! I hate them. I feel all naked on the east side, stuck up here with nothing but the dead flats between me and that Shadow yonder. There's an Eye in it. Come on! We've got to get down today somehow.'  His Eye watches that way all the time. It caught Sméagol there, long ago.' Gollum shuddered.   In fact with every step towards the gates of Mordor Frodo felt the Ring on its chain about his neck grow more burdensome. He was now beginning to feel it as an actual weight dragging him earthwards. But far more he was troubled by the Eye: so he called it to himself. ... The Eye: that horrible growing sense of a hostile will that strove with great power to pierce all shadows of cloud, and earth, and flesh, and to see you: to pin you under its deadly gaze, naked, immovable. So thin, so frail and thin, the veils were become that still warded it off.  ...  In this evil hole they cowered, hoping in its shadow to escape the attention of the Eye.   Interesting here that Frodo refers to it as the Eye as something he invented.   No, no indeed,' said Gollum.Hobbits must see, must try to understand. He does not expect attack that way. His Eye is all round, but it attends more to some places than to others.   Book IV Chatper 4 - Of Herbs and Stewed Rabbit Here is a good allusion to a red eye watching them   The dusk was deep when at length they set out, creeping over the westward rim of the dell, and fading like ghosts into the broken country on the borders of the road: The moon was now three nights from the full, but it did not climb over the mountains until nearly midnight, and the early night was very dark. A single red light burned high up in the Towers of the Teeth, but otherwise no sign could be seen or heard of the sleepless watch on the Morannon.  For many miles the red eye seemed to stare at them as they fled, stumbling through a barren stony country. They did not dare to take the road, but they kept it on their left, following its line as well as they could at a little distance. At last, when night was growing old and they were already weary, for they had taken only one short rest, the eye dwindled to a small fiery point and then vanished: they had turned the dark northern shoulder of the lower mountains and were heading southwards.   Later on:   trees hewn down wantonly and left to die, with evil runes or the fell sign of the Eye cut in rude strokes on their bark   And of course,   The brief glow fell upon a huge sitting figure, still and solemn as the great stone kings of Argonath. The years had gnawed it, and violent hands had maimed it. Its head was gone, and in its place was set in mockery a round rough-hewn stone, rudely painted by savage hands in the likeness of a grinning face with one large red eye in the midst of its forehead  The trough narrowed rapidly. Soon Sam came to a long flight of broad shallow steps. Now the orc-tower was right above him, frowning black, and in it the red eye glowed. Now he was hidden in the dark shadow under it. He was coming to the top of the steps and was in the Cleft at last.  The red eye of the tower had not been blind. He was caught.  and he knew that somewhere an Eye was searching for him.  'The Eye was busy elsewhere, I suppose,' said Shagrat. 'Big things going on away west, they say.'   In Return of the King:   Thence, turning and encircling all its wide girth from south to north, it climbed at last, high in the upper cone, but still far from the reeking summit, to a dark entrance that gazed back east straight to the Window of the Eye in Sauron’s shadow-mantled fortress. Often blocked or destroyed by the tumults of the Mountain’s furnaces, always that road was repaired and cleaned again by the labours of countless orcs.  One moment only it stared out, but as from some great window immeasurably high there stabbed northward a flame of red, the flicker of a piercing Eye; and then the shadows were furled again and the terrible vision was removed. The Eye was not turned to them: it was gazing north to where the Captains of the West stood at bay, and thither all its malice was now bent, as the Power moved to strike its deadly blow; but Frodo at that dreadful glimpse fell as one stricken mortally. His hand sought the chain about his neck. Sam knelt by him. Faint, almost inaudibly, he heard Frodo whispering: ‘Help me, Sam! Help me, Sam! Hold my hand!   And far away, as Frodo put on the Ring and claimed it for his own, even in Sammath Naur the very heart of his realm, the Power in Barad-dûr was shaken, and the Tower trembled from its foundations to its proud and bitter crown. The Dark Lord was suddenly aware of him, and his Eye piercing all shadows looked across the plain to the door that he had made; and the magnitude of his own folly was revealed to him in a blinding flash, and all the devices of his enemies were at last laid bare."
tolkienfans,3ddax2,xixor,13,Wed Jul 15 17:33:36 2015 UTC,"Note that all of the quotes from The Two Towers pointing towards an actual, physically present light as an eye are in fact not from Barad-dur, but from the Towers of Teeth at the Black Gate or the Tower of Cirith Ungol."

tolkienfans,3ddax2,NoteTypical,2,Wed Jul 15 19:02:27 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure to be honest, I think that is the point of all those quotes... it's somewhat ambiguous, the size depends on the context.    In some instances The Eye is viewed from afar on the tower, in others it is a presence and vision that some see in their minds eye.  At different times it is on Sauron's body as a physical eye, physical on or in Sauron's dark tower, and a manifestation of the spirit and attention of Sauron."

As I understand it, we know Sauron has some kind of body during the LotR since Gollum talks about seeing his hand with a missing finger when he was imprisoned in Mordor. What he looks like and whether his form is comparable to the one at the end of the Second Age remains unclear, but clearly he is not willing to expose himself and join the battle without the Ring."
tolkienfans,3ddax2,ToffeeKing,37,Wed Jul 15 11:41:31 2015 UTC,"It's not just extrapolation from Gollum's one comment in LotR; Tolkien's letters are somewhat more descriptive about Sauron's form: ""In the contest with the Palantír Aragorn was the rightful owner. Also the contest took place at a distance, and in a tale which allows the incarnation of great spirits in a physical and destructible form their power must be far greater when actually physically present. Sauron should be thought of as very terrible. The form that he took was that of a man of more than human stature, but not gigantic. In his earlier incarnation he was able to veil his power (as Gandalf did) and could appear as a commanding figure of great strength of body and supremely royal demeanour and countenance."""

tolkienfans,3ddax2,magradhaid,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:47:48 2015 UTC,I find it interesting that Sauron is often interpreted (through the films and fan art) as wearing the ring on his right hand. J. R. R. Tolkien (writing in the mid 1900's) would have likely imagined the ring on Sauron's left hand as the left hand was the Devil's hand.  Slightly off-topic but I always found it an interesting thought.
tolkienfans,3ddax2,NoteTypical,9,Wed Jul 15 19:07:32 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if Tolkien would have agreed, given Eldarin Hands, Fingers & Numerals and Related Writings: (VT47:9, c. 1968):   No distinction was felt between left and right by the Eldar. There was nothing queer, ill-omened (sinister), weak, or inferior about the 'left'. Nor anything more correct and proper (right), of good omen, or honour about the 'right'. The Eldar were 'ambidexters', and the allocation of different habitual services or duties to the right or the left was a purely individual and personal matter, undirected by any general inherited racial habit.   He also translated a similar passage (VT49:8, c. 1969) into Quenya, reading:   The Elves were ambidexters; consequently the left hand was not to them evil in their imaginations. On the contrary. For if one turned the face westwards as was usual, the left hand pointed away from Melkor (in the North), and if northwards, it pointed towards Aman (the Blessed Land).   Tolkien didn't believe this back in the 1930s, where his Etymologies contained Noldorin crumguru ""wiley, sinister, guilty"" from a ""left hand"" word, though we don't know when (in between the 1930s and 1968) he abandoned this idea.  However, Bilbo wears the Ring on his left forefinger in Riddles in the Dark - as does Frodo in A Knife in the Dark, which are the only times Tolkien actually mentions which finger the Ring is on, save for drafts of FotR's The Shadow of the Past in HoME6 (Ancient History) where Tolkien initially wrote that ""Bingo [Frodo-precursor] had never seen it on any finger but his own forefinger"", though he immediately deleted that. Frodo then for some reason wears it on his right ring-finger when claiming it in the Sammath Naur, though (which is what's bitten off).  Uluithiad has stated (as his opinion) that it might be ""thematically elegant"" for Sauron and Frodo to have lost the same finger, given that ""But in the heart of Sauron's power, in claiming it as his own, suddenly Frodo chooses a different finger? Why? Is there something behind that? I think so."""
tolkienfans,3ddax2,magradhaid,3,Wed Jul 15 22:38:29 2015 UTC,"Similar to my other lengthy comment, I thought it would be interesting to look at the Similarilion for references to the eye of Suaron.  AINULINDALË, The Music of the Ainur   and the light of the eyes of Melkor was like a flame that withers with heat and pierces with a deadly cold.   Interesting that both Sauron and Melkor have similar eyes; maybe Sauron inherited this from his former master through servitude?  Though, there are numerous references in the silmarilion to the Valar having eyes that are sources of light.  Chapter 19, Of Beren and Lúthien   Now Gorlim would have drawn back, but daunted by the eyes of Sauron he told at last all that he would know. Then Sauron laughed; and he mocked Gorlim, and revealed to him that he had only seen a phantom devised by wizardry to entrap him; for Eilinel was dead. 'Nonetheless I will grant thy prayer,' said Sauron; 'and thou shalt go to Eilinel, and be set free of my service.' Then he put him cruelly to death.   AKALLABÊTH, The Downfall of Númenor   For Sauron himself was filled with great fear at the wrath of the Valar, and the doom that Eru laid upon sea and land. It was greater far than aught he had looked for, hoping only for the death of the Númenóreans and the defeat of their proud king. And Sauron, sitting in his black seat in the midst of the Temple, had laughed when he heard the trumpets of Ar-Pharazôn sounding for battle; and again he had laughed when he heard the thunder of the storm; and a third time, even as he laughed at his own thought, thinking what he would do now in the world, being rid of the Edain for ever, he was taken in the midst of his mirth, and his seat and his temple fell into the abyss. But Sauron was not of mortal flesh, and though he was robbed now of that shape in which he had wrought so great an evil, so that he could never again appear fair to the eyes of Men, yet his spirit arose out of the deep and passed as a shadow and a black wind over the sea, and came back to Middle-earth and to Mordor that was his home. There he took up again his great Ring in Barad-dûr, and dwelt there, dark and silent, until he wrought himself a new guise, an image of malice and hatred made visible; and the Eye of Sauron the Terrible few could endure.   OF THE RINGS OF POWER AND THE THIRD AGE, in which these tales come to their end   Thus the Exiles of Númenor established their realms in Arnor and in Gondor; but ere many years had passed it became manifest that their enemy, Sauron, had also returned. He came in secret, as has been told, to his ancient kingdom of Mordor beyond the Ephel Dúath, the Mountains of Shadow, and that country marched with Gondor upon the east. There above the valley of Gorgoroth was built his fortress vast and strong, Barad-dûr, the Dark Tower; and there was a fiery mountain in that land that the Elves named Orodruin. Indeed for that reason Sauron had set there his dwelling long before, for he used the fire that welled there from the heart of the earth in his sorceries and in his forging; and in the midst of the Land of Mordor he had fashioned the Ruling Ring. There now he brooded in the dark, until he had wrought for himself a new shape; and it was terrible, for his fair semblance had departed for ever when he was cast into the abyss at the drowning of Númenor. He took up again the great Ring and clothed himself in power; and the malice of the Eye of Sauron few even of the great among Elves and Men could endure."
tolkienfans,3ddax2,xixor,4,Wed Jul 15 18:38:08 2015 UTC,"The Eye is almost certainly metaphysical. By it Sauron can see over great distances and even, to some degree, into the minds over which he has influence.   That doesn't rule out a physical manifestation of the eye, but even references that suggest this are probably meant to be understood primarily as a preternatural phenomenon."
tolkienfans,3dfoct,Norguy77,12,Wed Jul 15 22:16:16 2015 UTC,"The key element is power. Sauron wasn't corrupted during the Music (because ""in his beginning he was of the Maiar of Aulë""), which makes sense because it was largely themes of discord on Melkor's part and the creation of chaos as opposed to order and control. But this changed when a number of the Ainur entered into world and began ordering it.   Yet so great was the power of [Melkor's] uprising that in ages forgotten he contended with Manwë and all the Valar, and through long years in Arda held dominion over most of the lands of the Earth. But he was not alone. For of the Maiar many were drawn to his splendour in the days of his greatness, and remained in that allegiance down into his darkness; and others he corrupted afterwards to his service with lies and treacherous gifts. (The Silmarillion, ""Of the Enemies"").   One example of Morgoth's ability to corrupt or sway others Tolkien talks about in Morgoth's physicality, namely his eyes and look.   ...the light of the eyes of Melkor was like a flame that withers with heat and pierces with a deadly cold (The Silmarillion, ""Ainulindalë"").  ...and some [elves Morgoth] so daunted by the terror of his eyes that they needed no chains more, but walked ever in fear of him, doing his will wherever they might be (The Silmarillion, ""Of the Noldor"").   Notice how chains is used to attribute falling under Morgoth's will to imprisonment, much as Sauron was described as being under ""bonds.""   Then Sauron was ashamed, and he was unwilling to return in humiliation and to receive from the Valar a sentence, it might be, of long servitude in proof of his good faith; for under Morgoth his power had been great. Therefore when Eönwë departed he hid himself in Middle-earth; and he fell back into evil, for the bonds that Morgoth had laid upon him were very strong. (The Silmarillion, ""Of The Rings of Power and the Third Age"")   I think this paragraph is key. Sauron was initially attracted to Morgoth's power and splendor and ordering of Arda, though there's also an element of enslavement. Ironically, like Gollum or Frodo become addicted to the Ring, Sauron could in a sense be called an addict or prisoner of Morgoth's will"

tolkienfans,3dd37x,Kiltmanenator,11,Wed Jul 15 09:20:16 2015 UTC,"One thing to keep in mind is that telepathy and precognition are kind of things in middle earth. Some characters in The Lord of the Rings have an uncanny ability to read/guess the thoughts of others, or posses knowledge of events far away in distance or time. See Galadriel and Faramir. Of course, there are various degrees of narrative ambiguity in those examples. But they do provide some evidence that in the far more magical setting of the First Age it is not unreasonable for loremasters to posses conviction that they know the truth of a matter even if an eye witness account of the detail in question may not exist.  For 4 I think this defiantly applies. I would surprised if the wise of elven kind had no conception of what went down at the gates of Angband. Although Mycd also points out that Thorondor could have provided an account.  Feanor's death also seems like something that would broadcast in such a manner. Consider how that changes the reading of the scene. It's not necessarily a private thought that Feanor keeps to himself to avoid damaging the moral of his sons. It's something that probably any of Feanor's sons can either see for themselves, or know their father's mind. They know his pessimism, but also understand the depths of his conviction.  Consider also that a similar charge is laid upon the hero's of The Lord of the Rings. From the Council of Elrond, to the Last Debate, the heros are presented with decisions with no clear answer. No prudent advisor could possibly give a counsel that assured survival and victory. All they can do is try. Frodo is literally tasked with something that is impossible. No person could have disposed of the ring, yet we do not think of the quest as a fool's errand. Even though it is just as much one as the Oath of Feanor."

Feanors sons, followers and storytellers told great tales about him, for thousands of years, so these are what was passed down in elven lore. Elves certainly had long centuries to reflect, flush out truths and presumptions, motives, etc. for our narrator to rely on. Cases of 'it is said...' are exactly this, plausible rumors that directly fit the narrative.  3 Due to the kinslaying, his evil oath, and general trouble he caused, Feanor was and will not be 'reincarnated' anytime soon, and doomed to wait in Mandos until the Dagor Dagorath.  4 My asssumption is Thorondor tells Turgon or others of Fingolfin's final battle - or the King's guards/Captains saw the fight from a few miles away. Or by some later freed slave, a captured orc, etc. Also don't rule out that these are such powerful calaquendi Noldor, that perhaps his followers simply 'knew' what happened because they're elves, saw visions or dreams of it, etc."
tolkienfans,3dd37x,ReinierPersoon,3,Wed Jul 15 16:06:31 2015 UTC,"I had to ask about Feanor's foreknowledge of death because it is the absolutely irredeemable act of his: to demand his sons destroy themselves attempting the impossible. It would seem pretty irresponsible for elven poets and singers to simply make that part up. It's not like there isn't enough material to work with to show Feanor's marring.  As for Mandos, can't you go and talk to people in there even if their bodies haven't been reconstituted? I'm forgetting the name, ATM, but isn't it written that one of the notable Noldorin males died in Beleriand but after was able to walk and talk in Mandos with his father?"
tolkienfans,3dd37x,ReinierPersoon,7,Wed Jul 15 16:29:06 2015 UTC,"I think you mean Finrod. I think it said he was reincarnated and ended up back in Valinor, which would make sense since his father never died so they would not be together in the Halls of Mandos.  There is another one, Glorfindel, who died and was reincarnated in Valinor and eventually travelled back to Middle-earth.   And Fëanor knew that the Noldor could not overthrow Morgoth, but he also seemed to have foreknowledge that the Valar would come to overthrow him. He says so when they are leaving Valinor and the Doom of Mandos is pronounced. ""Yeah, in the end they will follow me"". So he knows that he cannot defeat Morgoth, but foresees that his quest will lead to his defeat anyway.  He couldn't release his sons from their oath anyway, as the oath was not made to him."
tolkienfans,3db776,Blkcdngaybro,27,Tue Jul 14 22:36:07 2015 UTC,"Morgoths goal was to discover Gondolin. He did essentially give Hurin special vision, and I feel it is directly akin Saruman's or Denethor's palantir, as Hurin saw only those things that Morgoth wished him to see.    And taking Húrin from prison he set him in a chair of stone upon a high place of Thangorodrim. There he was bound by the power of Morgoth, and Morgoth standing beside him cursed him again; and he said: 'Sit now there; and look out upon the lands where evil and despair shall come upon those whom thou lovest. Thou hast dared to mock me, and to question the power of Melkor, Master of the fates of Arda. Therefore with my eyes thou shalt see, and with my ears thou shalt hear; and never shalt thou move from this place until all is fulfilled unto its bitter end.'   So the best analogy I can give you, is Hurin essentially could see through a palantir, with Morgoths immense powers simply acting in place of a physical/crafted item."
tolkienfans,3db776,Mycd,3,Tue Jul 14 22:50:25 2015 UTC,"I had imagined it more like Morgoth being connected to whatever evil essences reside in his subordinates, specifically like the one mentioned when Glaurung speaks,     Then suddenly he [Glaurung] spoke by the evil spirit that was in him, saying: 'Hail son of Húrin. Well met!'   with Morgoth at the focus, and the knowledge or perceptions obtained refracted through him and directed at Húrin.  Though I suspect that Húrin being on the peak of a mountain might also be of significance..."
tolkienfans,3db776,drn038,6,Wed Jul 15 01:31:54 2015 UTC,"Yes. Morgoth's powers would've been far stronger than any seeing stone. Likely Hurin heard, felt and saw his family quite directly during the ordeal.   We honestly don't know what Denethor experienced in his tower, but i wager Sauron manipulated him similarly."
tolkienfans,3db776,Mycd,5,Wed Jul 15 01:52:03 2015 UTC,Sauron didn't have to manipulate what Denethor saw - he manipulated his despair so that he interpreted what he saw in the worst possible way.
tolkienfans,3db776,fileg,3,Wed Jul 15 03:08:27 2015 UTC,"But, IIRC, he did it anyway."
tolkienfans,3db776,juandh,3,Wed Jul 15 04:30:36 2015 UTC,"I guess it depends on how you interpret it. He could not get the palantir to make things up, and he could not use speech (that's not how palantiri work). So, for instance, he pushed Denethor to see the fleet sailing up from the south, knowing his despair would push him to believe it was corsairs.  edit:    Alone the palantíri could only ""see:"" they did not transmit sound. Ungoverned by a directing mind they were wayward, and their ""visions"" were (apparently at least) haphazard. (Unfinished Tales)   one stone to another, speech could be used if both watchers were agreed. But I thought Denethor believed he was not revealing himself. I suppose I might be wrong about that."
tolkienfans,3db776,fileg,14,Wed Jul 15 04:38:19 2015 UTC,"Take for example this excerpt from the alliterative poem of the Children of Hurin from The Lays of Beleriand:   Then Thalion was thrust   / to Thangorodrim, that mountain that meets   / the misty skies on high o'er the hills   / that Hithlum sees blackly brooding    /on the borders of the north. To a stool of stone  /  on its steepest peak they bound him in bonds,    /an unbreakable chain, and the Lord of Woe   / there laughing stood, then cursed him for ever   / and his kin and seed with a doom of dread,   / of death and horror. There the mighty man    /unmoved sat; but unveiled was his vision,    /that he viewed afar all earthly things    /with eyes enchanted that fell on his folk-   / a fiend's torment.   It's clear that it's not metaphorical, he was given enchanted vision."
tolkienfans,3db776,Helios-Apollo,4,Wed Jul 15 02:00:59 2015 UTC,"He is sharing Morgoth's view of the world, which means, that yes he has a sort of palantir like ability to both see (and perhaps hear) things going on in the world.  The one catch though is that Morgoth is in control of what he sees, so he could be deceived in what he was able to observe in the world at large just like Denethor was by Sauron, and thus would not necessarily be able to observe the truth of what is happening in the world."
tolkienfans,3db776,rcuosukgi42,3,Tue Jul 14 23:45:15 2015 UTC,"Exactly.   Unhappy was the lot of Húrin; for all that Morgoth knew of the  working of his malice Húrin knew also, but lies were mingled with  the truth, and aught that was good was hidden or distorted."
tolkienfans,3dcab3,Glovenator,10,Wed Jul 15 03:44:44 2015 UTC,"Legolas briefly talks about how the woods of Lórien might look in the spring:   There lie the woods of Lothlórien! ' said Legolas. `That is the fairest of all the dwellings of my people. There are no trees like the trees of that land. For in the autumn their leaves fall not, but turn to gold. Not till the spring comes and the new green opens do they fall, and then the boughs are laden with yellow flowers; and the floor of the wood is golden, and golden is the roof, and its pillars are of silver, for the bark of the trees is smooth and grey. So still our songs in Mirkwood say. My heart would be glad if I were beneath the eaves of that wood, and it were springtime!""   As we can tell from later descriptions, the trees Legolas is describing are mallorn-trees, as seen of the ones surrounding Cerin Amroth,   Upon it, as a double crown, grew two circles of trees: the outer had bark of snowy white, and were leafless but beautiful in their shapely nakedness; the inner were mallorn-trees of great height, still arrayed in pale gold.   So the inner ring of mallorn-trees had leaves, the outer ring might be some kind of birch tree given the white bark, in which case any foliage would be very high up the tree, but since the Fellowship are coming to Lórien in mid-January its leaves would have dropped, but would probably sprout again in the spring."

tolkienfans,3d8seo,ReinierPersoon,6,Tue Jul 14 19:28:10 2015 UTC,"The Eagles had a heiarchary indeed, likely related to size and age, all following an unnamed Lord of the Eagles (possibly Gwaihir, but likely his predecesor). The Eagles had no relationship or alliance with the woodland elves, and kept to themselves. Their good eyes, hatred for all orcs, dragons and evil things, and a friendship with Gandalf is what brought them.  Thorin's little company helped rally the dwarves and would certainly be part of their 'Army'.   Beorn was explicity independant, on nobodies side and didn't serve or join Bard or other 'men' - let alone even speak to them at any point. He hated orcs tremendously, and had become fond of Gandalf, Bilbo and the dwarves following their earlier deeds in the mountains. He was not aligned with the lakemen in any formal or even slight way.   For this matter, the bats were likely opportunistic, than firmly taking sides with the orcs for example. They latched on and attacked the wounded, regardless of side.   Wars like this aren't clean cut with proper sides. They're nasty affairs, scattered groups and forces, improvised and mesy chaos, so this was somewhat intentional on Tolkien's part.   5 armies were: men, dwarves, elves, orcs, and wargs. Beyond these were a variety of independant interests and actors, much like any modern war, so don't feel the need to align or shoehorn Beorn, Galdalf, eagles, bats, etc into one of the defined 'armies'."

tolkienfans,3d8seo,Bomb_Tombadil,21,Tue Jul 14 19:33:44 2015 UTC,"In the book it was Dwarves, Men, Elves, Goblins (Orcs), and Wolves (Wargs).  However, the books are significantly different from the movies in that the Wargs in the books are intelligent. The movies changed them into being merely evil riding animals, essentially an Orc version of a horse. In the movies, the Wargs are also not a significant presence on the battlefield.  It appears that the movies went with the list below (in order of appearance):   Men from the Lake Town, under Bard. Elves from Mirkwood under Thranduil. Dwarves from the Iron Hills under Dain. Orcs from Dol Guldur, under Azog. Orcs/goblins from Gundabad, under Bolg. (Explicitly referred to as an army by Bilbo)   And also the Eagles and Beorn show up, who swiftly defeated that final army.  However, the following is stated in an Entertainment Weekly article:   “Tolkien uses eagles in a way that can be kind of awkward because they tend to show up out of the blue and change things pretty quickly,” says the director. “So here they’re just part of the plan, not the saviors.

That the war has not reemerged, and that neither of the groups took a mass exodus makes me believe it had more than potential. That some people continue to be unhappy about precisely where the line is drawn is, therefore, no reason to change. And unless everyone would be fine with me banning a hell of a lot more people for screaming at each other about the movies, there's no reason to even consider it.  I deleted a comment earlier in support of my initial comment in this chain, saying 'PREACH!', from a user I had no idea held such beliefs.

tolkienfans,3d3i2y,jrrtolkiennerd,19,Mon Jul 13 05:49:47 2015 UTC,"Here is the full quote for those who's books are too far away.  ‘The victor would emerge stronger than either, and free from doubt,’ said Gandalf. ‘But Isengard cannot fight Mordor, unless Saruman first obtains the Ring. That he will never do now. He does not yet know his peril. There is much that he does not know. He was so eager to lay his hands on his prey that he could not wait at home, and he came forth to meet and to spy on his messengers. But he came too late, for once, and the battle was over and beyond his help before he reached these parts. He did not remain here long. I look into his mind and I see his doubt. He has no woodcraft. He believes that the horsemen slew and burned all upon the field of battle; but he does not know whether the Orcs were bringing any prisoners or not. And he does not know of the quarrel between his servants and the Orcs of Mordor; nor does he know of the Winged Messenger.’"
tolkienfans,3d3i2y,25willp,14,Mon Jul 13 08:24:38 2015 UTC,"I don't think it is any more definitive than the first passage, when Gandalf speaks the second time he is doing so on the assumption that his guess is correct. He is just filling in the picture as to why Saruman might have come and what else must have happened if in fact he did say peekaboo to Aragorn & Co.  The last quoted sentence, though, does imply that Gandalf knows beyond speculation that if Saruman was the bump in the night, he must not be anywhere nearby. Of course there are various ways he might have known that, or again he could be stating a guess as a certainty- after all there is no reason for Saruman to stick around in a musty forest when he has much better things to do.  In general I think the tone of the passage can be attributed not to any specific knowledge but to Gandalf's confidence in his own reasoning and wisdom - remember his line in the same scene, to the effect that he talks to himself because he is the smartest person in the room - he doesn't feel the need to qualify his speech with a lot of ifs and assumings."
tolkienfans,3d3i2y,juandh,13,Mon Jul 13 06:53:37 2015 UTC,"If Tolkien were still alive to be asked, he might have replied ""I don't know"".  I myself would say ""probably Saruman in person, but not certainly.""  It was probably Saruman, spying, but not daring to confront them.  Perhaps he wore a hat not a hood in an attempt to disguise himself, or to imitate Gandalf (of whose survival he probably did not know yet).  He may have scared off their horses, though we later learn that they ran with joy to someone rather than in fear from someone.  Perhaps he startled them enough for them to drag their pickets and bolt, but then then they smelled Shadowfax and ran to him in joy - thus setting up Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas for their crucial meeting with Gandalf.  If so, this would be yet another instance of an evil person tripping over his own feet because Providence has other plans."
tolkienfans,3d3i2y,harabanaz,3,Mon Jul 13 14:20:19 2015 UTC,"or to imitate Gandalf (of whose survival he probably did not know yet).   At this point in the story, would Saruman have had any way of learning of Gandalf's death and return as The White?"
tolkienfans,3d3i2y,menace64,3,Mon Jul 13 23:46:32 2015 UTC,"Only if he had any means of eavesdropping on Gandalf's interaction with Frodo when the latter was in danger of being discovered by Sauron on Amon Hen, I think."

tolkienfans,3d3i2y,composerofclassical,5,Mon Jul 13 06:39:48 2015 UTC,I believe it is confirmed to Saruman. But like all of Tolkien we only know what characters at the time knew.

tolkienfans,3d3j4l,sindeloke,26,Mon Jul 13 06:01:59 2015 UTC,"Invisibility is a minor side effect. The Ring pulls its bearer into the wraith world, rendering them invisible to people on the regular one. However, divine beings such as Sauron and the Wizards already exist in both simultaneously, so they don't turn invisible. The same is true for Elves who have been in Valinor, such as Galadriel."
tolkienfans,3d3j4l,MikeOfThePalace,5,Mon Jul 13 06:19:13 2015 UTC,"But that doesn't seem to mesh with the portrayal of the Nazgul. They're explicitly mortals who've been pulled into that realm, and they can still be seen by the clothes they wear. The Ring's invisibility seems to work differently, acting on everything its user is ""wearing"" (apparently including weapons wielded as well as simple garments). While it's true Frodo can see into the Nazgul's world while wearing the Ring, he isn't interacting with it the way they are."
tolkienfans,3d3j4l,Uluithiad,30,Mon Jul 13 06:26:07 2015 UTC,"The Ring does not make wielded weapons invisible.   And the Nazgul's clothes are invisible. Their robes, which they got after being made permanently invisible, aren't, nor should we expect them to be. The Nazgul aren't wearing their Rings anymore."
tolkienfans,3d3j4l,Impudenter,2,Mon Jul 13 06:49:16 2015 UTC,What happened to their rings? And why?
tolkienfans,3d3j4l,Uluithiad,7,Wed Jul 15 16:02:27 2015 UTC,Sauron has them. Tolkien tells us that (lacking the One) it is through the Nine that he maintains primary control over their wills. He addresses this when talking about a hypothetical in which the Nazgul reached Mount Doom with Frodo still possessing the One Ring.
tolkienfans,3d3j4l,Impudenter,2,Wed Jul 15 16:13:19 2015 UTC,"Interesting. If a nazgul were to reclaim his ring, or if Sauron would just not be in control of the nine rings, what would happen? Would he simply have more of a free will, instead of having to obey Sauron? Or would he die, or something?"
tolkienfans,3d3j4l,Uluithiad,5,Wed Jul 15 16:15:13 2015 UTC,"Maybe. Or maybe they would just be more susceptible to command by anyone else who had the One. They wouldn't die, though."
tolkienfans,3d3j4l,fearsomeduckins,12,Wed Jul 15 16:21:06 2015 UTC,"Couple things to consider, though. In the first place, the rings of the Nazgul are not the One Ring, and may not have exactly the same properties. In the second place, there are robes that they are wearing that have been pulled into the wraith world; the grey/pale robes they're mentioned wearing when Frodo sees them. The black robes they wear are over the top of all that, specifically to give shape to their nothingness. Presumably it works like dropping a blanket over someone wearing the One Ring would. And third, the Nazgul don't actually wear their rings anymore, Sauron has them. They're just permanently enslaved. So that may make a difference as well."
tolkienfans,3d3j4l,Impudenter,2,Mon Jul 13 06:51:23 2015 UTC,"If the nazgul would have their rings, what difference would it make?  Also, what would happen if they got the one ring?"
tolkienfans,3d3j4l,fearsomeduckins,2,Wed Jul 15 16:04:52 2015 UTC,"At this point, probably very little, from a power standpoint at least. They're completely enslaved by the rings. From the standpoint of their robes being invisible, however, it might make a difference. When you put the ring on, it takes you into the wraith world, and the clothes you're wearing apparently come too (convenient, that). But the Nazgul aren't putting their rings on and off anymore, so the clothes they have in the spirit world are most likely the ones they were wearing the last time they put the ring on before becoming bound to it. If they were to put the ring on again, the clothes they have on over the top of those might become invisible, but they aren't actually wearing the ring and they are able to put robes over the top of their invisibility, and there may be a connection there.   And if they were to get the one ring, they would be constrained by Saruon's will to instantly bring it to him with all possible speed. They're completely enslaved, so they wouldn't be able to even consider claiming it for themselves or putting it on."

tolkienfans,3d3j4l,fearsomeduckins,11,Thu Jul 16 13:26:47 2015 UTC,"The ring turns mortals invisible. Basically, there are two realms of existence in Middle Earth, seen and unseen, or spirit world and physical world, if that makes it easier. The Ring pulls the wearer into the spirit world. For mortals, who exist in the physical world, this makes them physically invisible. However, immortal beings like the elves or Gandalf or Sauron himself exist in both the physical and spirit world at the same time (you can see this in the books at the Ford of Bruinen when Frodo sees Glorfindel shining like a light). For them, because they're already in the spirit world, their physical bodies do not become invisible. So when Sauron wore the ring, he was still visible (and Elrond and Gil-galad actually fight the visible Sauron while he's still wearing the Ring). Similarly, if an elf or a wizard were to put on the Ring they would remain visible. It only appears that the Ring's primary power is to make people invisible because we pretty much only see mortals wearing it."
tolkienfans,3d3j4l,The_Flabbergaster,9,Mon Jul 13 06:16:22 2015 UTC,IIRC only elves that have been to Valinor also exist in the wraith world.
tolkienfans,3d3j4l,fearsomeduckins,5,Mon Jul 13 15:12:51 2015 UTC,"Yea, I kind of simplified it a bit, but I'm kind of inclined to believe that it's a trait common to all elves. I'm not sure just going to Valinor would make such a fundamental alteration to their nature. It would be more likely to just amplify what's already there. Also, I'm thinking of Legolas on the Paths of the Dead and how he was completely unphased, and thinking that that might be some evidence."
tolkienfans,3d3j4l,Uluithiad,7,Mon Jul 13 15:52:50 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how the Paths of the Dead would matter, unless you've got some weird ideas about the Shadow Host.

tolkienfans,3d3j4l,fearsomeduckins,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:20:07 2015 UTC,"Just speculation really, but if the shadow host isn't in the wraith world, then where is it, exactly? And those quotes about Glorfindel, they're really more in reference to who Sauron's chief enemies are, rather than the powers possessed by such people. More relevant would be ""those who have dwelt in the Blessed Realm live at once in both worlds, and against both the Seen and the Unseen they have great power."" Which really is the core of the argument, I think. Well, this is undeniably true, but it doesn't mean that those who haven't lived in the Blessed Realm don't live in both realms, just with a whole lot less power. But, as I said, speculation."

He has a desire to control, to rule Middle-earth according to his desires. For a supervillain he doesn't really even make an appearance during the time period of Frodo's quest. He is holed up in Barad-dur while his underlings do all the work. In some strange irony the only person from LotR to meet with Sauron is Gollum, who is tortured by Sauron. Both their fates are tied to the Ring.  As said by others, the Ring won't turn Sauron invisible as he is already part of the spirit world."
tolkienfans,3d3j4l,Squirrel_Boy_1,0,Mon Jul 13 12:35:19 2015 UTC,"I like to imagine that Sauron used to have a huge ego.

You have only a choice of evils; and prudence would counsel you to strengthen such strong places as you have, and there await the onset; for so shall the time before your end be made a little longer.’  ‘Then you would have us retreat to Minas Tirith, or Dol Amroth, or to Dunharrow, and there sit like children on sand-castles when the tide is flowing?’ said Imrahil.  ‘That would be no new counsel,’ said Gandalf. ‘Have you not done this and little more in all the days of Denethor?

Cirith Ungol still might have been their best bet since its main defense doesn't report to Sauron. As you say I think Gandalf would have ended up deciding on the spot as they did with crossing the Mountains.  Once the hobbits were on their own, Gandalf might have hoped that they would take the long way around the mountains, which is a pretty bleak option - little chance of Minas Tirith holding out that long - but the most likely one to result in final success: travelers coming in from the South or East would be less conspicuous, and with Sauron's armies and his attention occupied with the subjugation of the West, it might be easier for them to get through.

This would be why he was so concerned when Faramir reported Frodo's passage towards Cirith Ungol: Gandalf assumes a giant spider is living there.

Frodo decides to take the Ring to Mordor, therefore eventually Frodo is going to get to Mordor. But by and large a lot of the specifics were left up to creative spontaneity. You really see this in the early drafts of the book, where Tolkien decides initially how to conceive and write characters/plot lines, and then completely changes them ex. imagine a fairly sinister Treebeard. Other details just occurred that Tolkien felt uncomfortable with but included, like Gandalf being absent before Frodo leaves the Shire. Where was he the whole time? Tolkien didn't really resolve the answer completely until writing The Council of Elrond. In hindsight the path of the book seems straightforward and set, but in reality the writing process was fairly organic/unorganized.  With that in mind, I honestly don't think Tolkien found a good answer for himself about Gandalf's plan. He knew the end he wanted, but didn't think of a good logical solution to his own contrived problem, how to get into Mordor. Gandalf didn't actually have a plan to discuss because Tolkien could never think of one."

tolkienfans,3cyvgc,Scorponix,13,Sun Jul 12 05:06:11 2015 UTC,That has been disproved in so many ways. One main reason that it would never work is that Mordor was being patrolled in the air by Fell Bests which would have seen them coming from miles away
tolkienfans,3cyvgc,menace64,21,Sun Jul 12 01:29:28 2015 UTC,"You don't even need to go that far. The Council of Elrond had no knowledge of fell beasts, so that wouldn't have factored into their decision to use or not to use the eagles. (Which is crazy anyways, because the eagles are a sentient race, not beasts of burdens, and they probably would have said no.)  Just leaving it at, ""Flying into Mordor is obvious as hell"" is sufficient an explanation. The number must be few, and their only hope was in absolute secrecy.  (I do agree with you though.)"
tolkienfans,3cyvgc,rosconotorigina,16,Sun Jul 12 01:36:27 2015 UTC,"Also, the Eagles aren't immune to the Ring's power. Letting some random Eagle carry the Ring would have been just a disaster.

tolkienfans,3cyvgc,IeIgHtNiNe,11,Sun Jul 12 02:45:06 2015 UTC,"the eagles are a sentient race, not beasts of burdens, and they probably would have said no.   I see this argument a lot in opposition to the whole ""hurr durr ride on eagles and drop the ring into mount doom,"" argument.  Honestly, I think the eagles would have absolutely been willing to complete the task and carry at least Gandalf and Frodo.  After all, Gwaihir was always willing to help Gandalf in his tasks, even going back to the Battle of the Five Armies.  At the end of the Battle of the Morannon, Gwaihir said, ""I would bear you whither you will, even were you made of stone.""  However, the eagles, being creatures of the air, probably would have had some foreknowledge of the Fell Beasts either in the lore of their own kind or from scouts, and would likely have refused on those grounds.  Also the whole ""obvious as hell"" problem.  I just don't think they would have refused to fly to Mordor just based solely on the fact that they could refuse.  They were always honorable and fought on the West's side even at the cost of their own.  Now, why in the hell Gandalf didn't ask them to be scouts is beyond me.  They could have given early knowledge of so many things:  The orc raid at Parth Galen, the relative strength of the forces of Isengard, the fleet of Umbar approaching Pelargir, the list goes on.  They also could have flown the company over Caradhras in relative secrecy."
tolkienfans,3cyvgc,Sean951,10,Sun Jul 12 04:49:54 2015 UTC,"I always figured they would have refused because Manwe wouldn't let them, but at the end, even Illuvatar was interceding on their behalf."

Let us live, yes, live just a little longer. Lost lost! We’re lost. And when Precious goes we’ll die, yes, die into the dust.’ He clawed up the ashes of the path with his long fleshless fingers. ‘Dusst!’ he hissed."
tolkienfans,3cslyi,AmbiguousAnonymous,2,Fri Jul 10 20:51:33 2015 UTC,"magic at the expense of technology?   Not really. In Tolkien, ""magic"" has two meanings: the natural powers of the Elves, Dwarves, and Numenoreans, which are called ""magic"" by common men and hobbits, and the evil powers of the Dark Lords, which Tolkien said are a type of technology which goes against the laws of nature. The Rings and their life-extending abilities, as well as the creation of Orcs, Trolls, and the like, are examples of this ""magic"". Tolkien sometimes used the term ""sorcery"" to refer to the evil type of ""magic""."
tolkienfans,3cslyi,AmbiguousAnonymous,13,Sun Jul 12 23:40:19 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything posted here.  Another example of immortality in LOTR is the tale itself.  One of my favorite excerpts:    'No, sir, of course not. Beren now, he never thought he was going to get that Silmaril from the Iron Crown in Thangorodrim, and yet he did, and that was a worse place and a blacker danger than ours. But that's a long tale, of course, and goes on past the happiness and into grief and beyond it - and the Silmaril went on and came to Eärendil. And why, sir, I never thought of that before! We've got - you've got some of the light of it in that star-glass that the Lady gave you! Why, to think of it, we're in the same tale still! It's going on. Don't the great tales never end? '   'No, they never end as tales,' said Frodo. `But the people in them come, and go when their part's ended. Our part will end later - or sooner.'  Also, another one of my favorite quotes from the whole trilogy deals with death:   It was Sam's first view of a battle of Men against Men, and he did not like it much. He was glad that he could not see the dead face. He wondered what the man's name was and where he came from; and if he was really evil of heart, or what lies or threats had led him on the long march from his home; and if he would not really rather have stayed there in peace-all in a flash of thought which was quickly driven from his mind."

That may be a bit dismissive on my part though so to go a little deeper, the theme of death is the theme of things coming to an end, which is all over LotR; the ending of the Third Age, the fading of the Elves, the end of the Fellowship. When rereading it now, the whole work always seems to be building to a great ending after which nothing will be the same. I think that for Tolkien, framing the tale as one about Death and the desire for deathlessness was a way to make it more applicable. Indeed that's what preceding portion of the paragraph is all about. Not everyone is enamored of power and dominion, but just about everyone has some feeling about death or a desire to live a longer life. LotR is about struggling to a great or difficult end, and dealing with it. I think Gandalf said it best:   'Well, here at last, dear friends, on the shores of the Sea comes the end of our fellowship in Middle-earth. Go in peace! I will not say: do not weep; for not all tears are an evil.'"

But it's not really obvious because there is so much else going on in the foreground.  Sauron himself wanted to ""order"" everything, possibly for the same reason (to halt change and keep everything the same forever) but was a tyrant. The fundamental knowledge of how to craft all the other Rings came from him, thus he must have had the capability or knowhow to slow or prevent change himself. Ironically, being Maia, he did have immortality but effectively was reduced to very little (apparently) compared to his original self - maybe as close to ""death"" as a Maia could go.  The ""gift"" is bitterly made clear after the end, where the tale of Arwen and Aragorn is included. I have trouble reading that still, it's very very sad. Yet Aragorn accepts it for what it is. Perhaps that was a direct illustration of grace in the face of the ""gift"". It's not part of the main story, however."
tolkienfans,3cslyi,AmbiguousAnonymous,3,Fri Jul 10 19:11:21 2015 UTC,"I think you're right, the whole point of showing how Aragorn accepted the gift gracefully was to show how great a person he was (as Numenoreans should be) and, by extension, how all humans should accept it the same way.

I usually like to give authors the last word, but I have to say that Tolkien was dead wrong about The Hobbit rewrite. Thank GOD he thought he couldn't write fairy stories without writing for children: losing the simple, conversational, and ""condescending"" tone of the narrator in The Hobbit would have stripped it of all its charm. Just think of all the people who cannot bring themselves to read LOTR, but love The Hobbit.

But this does not demand that it wasn't called Moria before then. Moria became the most common way (for non-Dwarves) to refer to it after they were driven out, but we see it being called Moria repeatedly within the Appendices while talking about times well before then. It is plastered into the Westron section of Balin's tomb, even though the strict Westron analogue to Khazad-dum would be Dwarrowdelf, a word still used within LotR. If this is a negative word, a word only applied to Khazad-dum as a fallen, empty hole, why would it be there?  Isn't the simplest explanation here to assume that it wasn't a name coined after the flight of the Dwarves? That the door isn't a mistake?  Edit: Having just woken up, I forgot to mention the most important part, the proof that the name was devised by the Elves for a place the Dwarves were actually living. Near the end of Appendix F we find:   But Moria is an Elvish name, and given without love; for the Eldar, though they might at need, in their bitter wars with the Dark Power and his servants, contrive fortresses underground, were not dwellers in such places of choice. They were lovers of the green earth and the lights of heaven; and Moria in their tongue means the Black Chasm.   The idea is that Moria is Moria because the Elves found the idea of living in such a place aesthetically distasteful. If it were not at all in use while people were actually living there, this is a very, very odd reason behind the name. Therefore, it only makes sense that the name was in use beforehand in a somewhat derogatory sense that, given their repeated use of it, didn't seem to bother the Dwarves much."

tolkienfans,3cokj9,HannasAnarion,6,Sat Jul 11 17:38:16 2015 UTC,"This was my thinking as well and you articulated it better than I could have. While I tend to believe it was really just a mistake in history and naming by the author, this theory works nicely within the story line. I have encountered several things recently in real life that have worked this way. The first one that pops in to my head is the confederate flag history in all the recent controversy. It was not an official symbol of the south, secession, etc... until some time after the war. It WAS, however, a fairly commonly used item informally. People were familiar with it, used it, and it carried weight as a symbol. It was only later that people chose to utilize it officially.   The same is true of language generally. Words are coined, disseminated, used, and often live long enough for their meaning to shift and adapt before finally being recognized in dictionaries.  It's not hard to imagine, after the great tragedy and sorrow of the Balrog and fall of such an incredible place, that the world would choose the darkest of names in use for the place. The emaning could even shift from good-natured joke between elves and dwarves to a more serious and sorrowful interpretation."

tolkienfans,3cokj9,Skweres88,15,Thu Jul 9 15:16:48 2015 UTC,"Admittedly one significant hole in the ""it's a mistake"" theory is that this error is a fairly consistent one.

tolkienfans,3cokj9,The_Grand_Secgend,2,Thu Jul 9 16:22:59 2015 UTC,"Another explanation is that Tolkien as the in-universe ""translator"" of the Red Book intentionally uses Moria to not confuse the reader, as the mines are commonly called Moria throughout the book.   That's very interesting and I've honestly never thought about that, but didn't Tolkien himself say that he had done a mistake in there?"
tolkienfans,3cokj9,AmbiguousAnonymous,2,Thu Jul 9 18:26:01 2015 UTC,"Plenty of satisfactory answers here (particularly /u/Uluithiad) but here is some textual reference to Moria pre-Fall of Eregion from Appendix B    Later some of the Noldor went to Eregion, upon the west of the Misty Mountains, and near to the West-gate of Moria. This they did because they learned that mithril had been discovered in Moria.  The Noldor were great craftsmen and less unfriendly to the Dwarves than the Sindar; but the friendship that grew up between the people of Durin and the Elven-smiths of Eregion was the closest that there has ever been between the two races. Celebrimbor was lord of Eregion and the greatest of their craftsmen; he was descended from Fëanor."

tolkienfans,3cokj9,Suola,4,Thu Jul 9 20:53:35 2015 UTC,Most of them would not have known what force resided in Moria and how powerful it really was. They didn't even really know what had become of Balin and his colony. Also the fact that the colony survived for some time shows that Durin's bane did not know everything that was happening there and with better luck the fellowship may could have gone unnoticed.

tolkienfans,3concy,jrrtolkiennerd,12,Thu Jul 9 15:14:52 2015 UTC,"As I see it, it was the ""son of Fingon"" lineage that was the ""retcon"". In The Silmarillion as published, Christopher Tolkien's goal was to synthesize a more or less coherent history out of a huge range of mutually inconsistent drafts (composed at very different points in Tolkien's life). As you note, the ""son of Fingon"" version has some nice simplicity to recommend it, and Tolkien never decisively settled on anything else (to the extent of writing out the stories in full with that answer).  But the thing is, Tolkien never wrote out the stories in full with the ""son of Fingon"" lineage, either. As I understand Christopher Tolkien's notes, his father considered that possibility only very briefly (""an ephemeral idea""): it really wasn't ever an ""established"" fact in JRRT's imagination, so adopting it in the published book was pretty clearly a mistake. This is one of the (many) parts of the legendarium that simply never got fully fleshed out. So while ""son of Orodreth"" leads to some complications, the evidence suggests that it's still considerably more likely than ""Fingon"" to have been what Tolkien would have settled on if he'd lived long enough to complete and publish The Silmarillion himself.  Christopher Tolkien's final sentiment on this, as I recall, was that he ought to have simply left Gil-galad's parentage obscure in the published Silm. I'm not sure that I agree, but it seems like there's no satisfying answer."
tolkienfans,3concy,Steuard,2,Thu Jul 9 16:47:57 2015 UTC,"I don't know Gil-galad is just such a minor character in the Silmarillion that to me, it hardly makes any differences what the details of his linage are.  As for Turin' story, I don't think it requires any great leap of imagination to come up with a reason why Gil-galad would be sent away and Finduilas not. If the story had required reworking, we wouldn't be looking at massive changes. Maybe more like a handful of sentences. But I don't even think the story would need reworking. Gil-galad is so minor in the Silmarillion it's hard to be aware of him until you look at a family tree, there's no need to sweat over unexplained details about such minor characters."

tolkienfans,3clm6w,stormfallen,34,Wed Jul 8 23:40:10 2015 UTC,"Hoo boy.  This might take a while.  I'm gonna be using http://lotrproject.com/ for family trees, though you have to keep in mind that many were pieced together by CT and JRRT changed his genealogies many times.  Also accents and umlauts and whatever are too much trouble.  First off, Galadriel and Celeborn, Arwen's maternal grandparents, were second cousins.  Possibly.  Elwe/Thingol, Olwe, and Elmo are described as brothers, but it's also possible that they were among the very first generation of Teleri Elves that awakened besides Lake Cuivienen.  If so, then it's likely they are brothers of oath rather than of blood.  I'm just gonna make them family though since it increases the inbreeding considerably.  Olwe is Galadriel's grandfather and Elmo is Celeborn's.  Galadriel was the daughter of Finarfin, third son of Finwe.  The middle brother, Fingolfin, was the father of Turgon, father of Idril, mother of Earendil, father of Elrond.  I'm far too lazy to figure out what degree of cousins Elrond and his wife Celebrian were though this connection.  Elmo's son Galadhon supposedly had two sons: Celeborn and Galathil, who was the father of Nimloth, wife of Dior, son of Luthien and Beren.  They are first cousins twice removed, I think.  And of course Luthien and Galadriel/Celeborn are first cousins once removed.  It's hard enough finding out how many ways Elwing is related to herself, but then her son has to go and marry the daughter of her great-uncle/third cousin and third/fourth cousin (with however many xth-removeds necessary.  And that's just the Elven ancestry.  I haven't even started on the three Houses of Men yet.  EDIT: continuing with the mortal ancestry.  I'm gonna start with Beren, he of one-handed fame.  Beren's parents, Barahir and Emeldir, were fourth cousins, both the great-great-great-grandchildren of Beor, namesake of his house.  That was...surprisingly simple.  Beren's first cousin Belegund was the father of Rian, wife of Huor and mother of Tuor, father of Earendil.  But Huor's great-great-great-grandfather Malach was the great-grandfather of Emeldir.  And...that's actually it, as far as I can tell.  The rese of the Edain family tree is a bit messed up (not even counting Turin and Nienor), but Arwen gets off easy there.  Of course, the whole tree becomes a lot less incesty if we don't assume that Elwe/Thingol, Olwe, and Elmo are literal brothers, but where's the fun in that!  TL;DR: concentrated incest has the opposite effect on beauty in Middle-Earth than in our world.  Instead of Charles II, we get Liv Tyler and Viggo Mortensan."
tolkienfans,3clm6w,ReinierPersoon,15,Thu Jul 9 00:30:03 2015 UTC,"Don't forget Melian. The marriage of Aragorn and Arwen is also the only marriage were both people are a tiny part Maia, if you don't count the 100% Maiar couples (who don't have offspring as far as I know). This is possibly the only part-Maiar couple with children."
tolkienfans,3clm6w,stormfallen,7,Thu Jul 9 01:04:51 2015 UTC,"There was a decent amount of inbreeding among the descendants of Elros, especially as the Dunedain of Arnor and Gondor dwindled, I would assume.  For example, Ar-Pharazon and Tar-Miriel were first cousins, and Arvedui and Firiel were very distantly related."
tolkienfans,3clm6w,ReinierPersoon,2,Thu Jul 9 01:17:41 2015 UTC,"Ah, you are right. I didn't really think of that. I think the founder population of Númenor would also not be as huge as in later years, when they seem to outnumber everyone else. It is like Charlemagne in the real world, where it is likely that almost everyone in Europe is descended from him. When you do the math we have many more ""ancestors"" than there were people at the time.  It might be that Elros was an ancestor of most of the Dunedáin."

Farther even than this [the Magic Isles], and few are the boats of mortal men that have dared so far, are set the Shadowy Seas wheron there float the Twilit Isles and the Tower of Pearl rises pale upon their most western cape; but as yet it was not built, and the Shadowy Seas stretched dark away till their uttermost shore in Eruman. -- BoLT 1 pp. 68, The Coming of the Valar   There are a couple more references in the tales, then stuff in outlines for the Earendil story.

He searches for Elwing and is blown far to the South. Wirilome. He escapes eastward. He goes back westward; he descries the Bay of Faery. The Tower of Pearl, the magic isles, the great shadows. BoLT 2 p260   And the last of the prose references is in a separate note for the story, written on a scrap of paper, or in a little notebook full of notes,   (xxi) 'The Sleeper in the Tower of Pearl awakened by Littleheart's gong: a messenger that was dispatched years ago by Turgon and enmeshed in magics. Even now he cannot leave the Tower and warns them of the magic.' -- [Christopher Tolkien comments: In C there is a statement, rejected, that the sleeper in the tower of Pearl was Idril herself.]   Then there are a couple of versions of a poem about it, but that's all.

This, to me, seems like Tolkien wrote out all of his Middle Earth stories as if they were fact or history. If memory serves correctly after the destruction of the ring the Third Age ended and eventually the elves left in Middle Earth would either die or leave like those before them. This would leave men without someone to fear. Whose to say men didn't stomp over the dwarves and hobbits, kill the ents and forget all about them as the centuries wore on? There could be something I'm overlooking (or perhaps I'm just looking too much) but for all we know Tolkien could be writing this as an alternative history to how mankind got to where it is today.

You revealed yourself to me just now, foolishly. Give it back to Sme´agolyou said. Do not say that again! Do not let that thought grow in you! You will never get it back.

tolkienfans,3clgs5,GaussWanker,3,Sun Jul 12 17:43:41 2015 UTC,"246, here's more of the context:   I do not think that Frodo's was a moral failure. At the last moment the pressure of the Ring would reach its maximum - impossible, I should have said, for any one to resist, certainly after long possession, months of increasing torment, and when starved and exhausted. Frodo had done what he could and spent himself completely (as an instrument of Providence) and had produced a situation in which the object of his quest could be achieved. His humility (with which he began) and his sufferings were justly rewarded by the highest honour; and his exercise of patience and mercy towards Gollum gained him Mercy: his failure was redressed.  We are finite creatures with absolute limitations upon the powers of our soul-body structure in either action or endurance. Moral failures can only be asserted, I think, when a man's effort or endurance falls short of his limits and the blame decreases as that limit is closer approached. Nonetheless, I think it can be observed in history and experience that some individuals seem to be placed in 'sacrificial' positions: situations or tasks that for perfection of solution demand powers beyond their utmost limits, even beyond all possible limits for an incarnate creature in a physical world - in which a body may be destroyed, or so maimed that it affects the mind and will. Judgement upon any such case should then depend on the motives and disposition with which he started out, and should weigh his actions against the utmost possibility of his powers, all along the road to whatever proved the breaking point.  Frodo undertook his quest out of love - to save the world he knew from disaster at his own expense, if he could; and also in complete humility, acknowledging that he was wholly inadequate to the task. His real contract was only to do what he could, to try to find a way, and to go as far on the road as his strength of mind and body allowed. He did that. I do not myself see that the breaking of his mind and will under demonic pressure after torment was any more a moral failure than the breaking of his body would have been - say, by being strangled by Gollum, or crushed by a falling rock.  That appears to have been the judgement of Gandalf and Aragorn and of all who learned the full story of his journey. Certainly nothing would be concealed by Frodo! But what Frodo himself felt about the events is quite another matter.  He appears at first to have had no sense of Guilt (III 224-5); he was restored to sanity and peace. But then he thought that he had given his life in sacrifice: he expected to die very soon. But he did not, and one can observe the disquiet growing in him...   It is very clearly talking about Frodo's failure to destroy the Ring."
tolkienfans,3clgs5,twoerd,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:48:55 2015 UTC,thanks! but that does imply that not all learned the full story. Perhaps there was a children's edition of frodo and the ring?

Barad-dur was the greatest fortress in Middle Earth at the time, and you can assume was the tallest structure as well, freestanding anyways.  Even then, its probably shorter than our modern skyscrapers.  For ease of comparison, lets say its the height of the Empire State Building.  381 meters.  You can see that from a maximum distance of about 75 kilometers away with clear conditions, which Mordor most certainly is not.  That means (assuming optimal conditions) you can see Barad Dur from Mount Doom (which is 45 kilometers apart) but not much farther than that.  The Black Gate, for reference, is 160 kilometers away, not to mention there's a whole mountain range blocking the view anyway.  So yeah, you really can't see Barad Dur from that far....assuming its as tall as the Empire State Building.  Its probably half that height most likely."

Even if it was on some gargantuan hill (which I don't think is true), lets say a height of 500 meters from the average for the Plains of Gorgoroth.  That's still only visible within 85 kilometers, or 52 miles.

tolkienfans,3ck36z,ReinierPersoon,4,Wed Jul 8 15:43:39 2015 UTC,He's only able to see the dark tower due to a combination of sitting in the Seat of Seeing and wearing the One Ring.
tolkienfans,3ck36z,i_smoke_php,3,Wed Jul 8 17:51:00 2015 UTC,"Yup, but in the movies they have a bit where I think Pippin and Gandalf see Barad-dur from the Minas Tirith, which they probably shouldn't be able to. They probably wanted to show some more of movie-eyeball-Sauron because for main villain he doesn't really make much appearances.  I'm not sure if it's just Amon Hen or Amon Hen + the Ring. I would say the Seat of Seeing is named because it extends vision by some trick of the Númenoreans (""magic""), and the Seat of Hearing would likely do the same for hearing. Probably used to guard the realm from when Gondor still had larger borders."
tolkienfans,3ck36z,ReinierPersoon,6,Wed Jul 8 22:01:46 2015 UTC,I thought that was just the light comin from minas morgal and no obvious buildings
tolkienfans,3ck36z,Collegenoob,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:22:49 2015 UTC,"Hm, now I'm not actually sure anymore. Minas Morgul was the one with the green light. I vaguely remember Barad-dur with the red Eye was shown quite a bit (especially compared to the books, where Barad-dur and Sauron aren't really described much)."
tolkienfans,3ck36z,ReinierPersoon,2,Wed Jul 8 22:24:25 2015 UTC,Well it can be seen from the Black Gate in the films. That's what about 100 miles?
tolkienfans,3ck36z,italia06823834,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:41:18 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Looking at this map:  http://i.imgur.com/iTDrM7D.png  OP's question is like asking if you could see a skyscraper on a hill in Eastern Europe from the Ruhr valley, or something. The curvature of the Earth, quite apart from any other concerns, makes it impossible."
tolkienfans,3ck36z,Fornad,6,Thu Jul 9 12:48:33 2015 UTC,"Alright let's take a look, shall we? The height of Barad-dûr is something we actually know very little about. Lotr.wikia (citation needed) gives a rather ridiculous scaled height used in the films of 5,000 ft/1,500m. If we plug that into our handy horizon estimation formula (d≈3.57√h, where d=distance to horizon in km and h=height of observer in meters) we get a distance of 139.37km or 86.6mi. That comes out to look something like this. So let’s come back to your question:   how far away could Barad-Dur be seen? Is it a fair assumption to say anything West of the Misty Mountains would not be able to see the eye? What about Moria (I mean higher on the mountain or from the door facing Mordor), Isengard, or Erebor?   Well in the data I used here, 86.6 miles is about to the edges of Mordor. Even without the mountains there, the curvature of Arda would prevent a direct line of sight at that point. Moria, Isengard, Erebor, and everything west of the Misty Mountains are decidedly outside the area one would be able to see the tower.  As a caveat, the numbers I used are completely arbitrary (I could find no accurate source). This is simply to give you an idea of how silly a notion it is that one could see Barad-dûr from such great distances. A 1,500m tall building would be absurdly tall and is almost certainly much taller than any more canon estimate. The current record holder (Burj Khalifa) is about half that height and used modern technology in its construction. Therefore I think we can safely put that as a maximum range. Also it’s important to note I didn’t take elevation into account in this calculation. However, the absurd height would probably more than compensate if we’re trying to find a maximum distance."
tolkienfans,3ck36z,EyeceEyeceBaby,3,Wed Jul 8 18:00:19 2015 UTC,"I used the same formula in my post, and I used the height of the Empire State Building as a theoretical maximum to how tall it would be, and its only some 380 meters tall.  I even suggested it was probably a lot shorter than that."
tolkienfans,3ck36z,Seafroggys,6,Wed Jul 8 19:56:07 2015 UTC,"Precisely, even if you take the ridiculous height from an un-cited article based on the films, you can't see it from beyond the walls of Mordor as people seem to think. Even if the mountains weren't there. Here's a visualization of how far it would be visible from your suggested height (not accounting for elevation). It would have been barely visible if at all from Cirith Ungol, let alone outside of Mordor. I think some people just envision Middle-Earth as a much smaller place."
tolkienfans,3ck36z,EyeceEyeceBaby,2,Wed Jul 8 20:16:23 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's unreasonable to say it would probably be in that range or possibly even taller. We know it's supposed to be the greatest fortress in Middle Earth, and so presumably the tallest as well. We know Orthanc is 500 feet, and Minas Tirith is 1000, although that's built into a mountain. So assuming over 1000 feet is not unreasonable. 1500 meters does seem like a bit much, but 500 or 600 is quite possible."
tolkienfans,3ck36z,fearsomeduckins,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:55:38 2015 UTC,"1000 feet is only 304 meters, so your point still fits right into my narrative."
tolkienfans,3ck36z,Seafroggys,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:40:00 2015 UTC,"But 1000 feet is the height of Minas Tirith, and Barad-dur is likely significantly taller. Perhaps still in the vicinity of 380m, but unlikely ""a lot shorter than that."""
tolkienfans,3ck36z,fearsomeduckins,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:04:00 2015 UTC,"Eh, I'm not sure Minas Tirith is a great example.  Each layer of the city was 100 feet above the prior, but it was also built on a rock.  The Tower of Ecthelion would be only about 300 feet.  Orthanc would be a better example there, and its only 500 feet, like you said."
tolkienfans,3ck36z,Seafroggys,4,Thu Jul 9 15:10:06 2015 UTC,"Well, the descriptions of Barad-dur are pretty limited so of course it isn't certain, but it does seem to also be built into or onto (or both) mountains.   wall upon wall, battlement upon battlement, black, immeasurably strong, mountain of iron, gate of steel, tower of adamant, he saw it: Barad-dur, Fortress of Sauron.  A brief vision he had of swirling cloud, and in the midst of it towers and battlements, tall as hills, founded upon a mighty mountain-throne above immeasurable pits; great courts and dungeons, eyeless prisons sheer as cliffs, and gaping gates of steel and adamant: and then all passed. Towers fell and mountains slid; walls crumbled and melted, crashing down; vast spires of smoke and spouting steams went billowing up, up, until they toppled like an overwhelming wave, and its wild crest curled and came foaming down upon the land. And then at last over the miles between there came a rumble, rising to a deafening crash and roar; the earth shook, the plain heaved and cracked, and Orodruin reeled.   It's pretty clear that it's supposed to be absolutely huge. Battlements the size of hills atop mountains of iron."
tolkienfans,3ck36z,fearsomeduckins,2,Thu Jul 9 15:19:45 2015 UTC,"It's weird. I saw your question, and I KNEW why you were asking it before I even opened the thread. I had the same thought when I saw the tattoo, and immediately wrote it off as artistic license."

tolkienfans,3ccew4,guitarromantic,25,Mon Jul 6 20:40:45 2015 UTC,The Luthien/Feanor option is the way to go.  They have perfect clarity; the two icons look like they go together (as opposed to being two random things put next to each other); they present an emphasis on the books rather than the movies' imagery... I could go on but you've got a winner as far as I'm concerned.

tolkienfans,3ccew4,GrimnirOdinson,2,Tue Jul 7 01:58:14 2015 UTC,They both look pretty cool but honestly I rather like the current ones we have. They work well with the purple/orange color schemes and represent two opposing forces (Gondor vs. Mordor).

tolkienfans,3ccew4,CeruleanRuin,4,Mon Jul 6 21:24:12 2015 UTC,"Well, the Eye is actually Tolkien's, but Jackson made it the whole embodiment of Sauron rather than just one of a host of symbols."
tolkienfans,3ccew4,Bomb_Tombadil,3,Tue Jul 7 05:06:37 2015 UTC,"I actually think that was one of his (Jackson's) best inventions. For an adaption to film, if Sauron did not have any physical manifestation it would have been too vague of a threat. I think he did well and it stayed true to the spirit of the book while suiting itself well to a visual medium.  SO that said, I'm in favor of keeping the buttons how they are. But then, I love the books and films equally. A lot of people seem to hate the films."

Every other version I've found has really crappy dialogue sections that are hard to pay attention to.  Inglis does all the voices and sings all the songs with their own unique melodies (did he write the melodies himself?) and completely captures the innocence a rustic nature of Hobbit-speech as well as the stern and proud cadence of someone like Aragorn.  Absolutely fantastic piece of performance.  There is NO better audio version of Lord of the Rings.

I've only heard the original myself, but either way Ian Holm and Michael Horden will always be the definitive Frodo and Gandalf to me (as will the unrecognisable Bill Nighy be Sam).  Aw hell, as will Peter Woodthorpe as Gollum.  There's so much of the dialogue of the books in there verbatim, I think Brian Sibley did an amazing job.  My only serious criticism of the BBC production is the same of that of Prof. Tolkien when talking about his book: it is too short.

Audiobooks have (giant sap story) changed my life and I have indulged in more literature this year than in the last six or seven combined (and I'm a lit major). I listen to them while I garden, bike, paint, clean, and sometimes when I can't sleep. I prefer males with British accents reading to me.  Robert Inglis is lovely.  I especially liked Inglis' version because he read the appendices, too, and I enjoy them just as much as the story. I have a BBC radio play of the hobbit on tape, with Bilbo voiced by Ian Holm that is quite wonderful, with sound effects, but overall I find radio plays harder to follow and less laudable in language.

So further elaboration and reiteration that herds of WILD kine (kine is a collective term for cows/cattle), that were specifically white.

This seems to imply that others have indeed blown it.  Also, your quote is slightly inaccurate, I believe. The quote I have is    ""It is said that if it be blown at need anywhere within the bounds of Gondor, as the realm was of old, its voice will not pass unheeded"".

In Fellowship, Boromir says he always blows the horn when setting out on a journey (he is warned against it when he does so leaving Rivendell, but that seems to be more about the Fellowship's need to be inconspicuous). I don't think Faramir's quote is so much about blowing the horn at all as about blowing it to summon help in desperate straits. That specific life-or-death situation would probably be a matter of legend or distant memory; but Boromir doesn't seem to be shy about using the horn for other purposes than summoning aid."

tolkienfans,3c05k2,dongazine_supplies,30,Tue Jul 7 17:34:36 2015 UTC,I think what Faramir meant was that no one would come to their aid if the horn was called because of the way their relationships had become poor.

tolkienfans,3buqv8,Aegn0r,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:08:49 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Feanor and Lúthien are the centre of the Tolkien mythos. Feanor is a symbol of pride gone wrong, which I believe is a better symbol for someone you want to down vote, as compared to a symbol of the enemy. Meanwhile I think Lúthien is the perfect upvote, and Tolkien always considered the story of Lúthien to be the centre of the Tolkien mythos."

And Lúthien is a symbol for beauty and perfection while Gandalf on the other hand stands for wisdom, something I would much rather see as upvote-able"
tolkienfans,3buqv8,Aegn0r,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:06:16 2015 UTC,"But Lúthien's heraldry has become more than just a symbol for her, it has become a symbol for the Silmarillion as a whole, as is probably the most recognisable symbol for Tolkien's mythos as it appears on the Silmarillion's dust jacket. Also we could not use the heraldry of Beren as many new comers would be confused with hand on it (as many would see it as a symbol of Saruman. Also I think they do relate to each other, Feanor fought under this banner to reclaim his treasure but failed, while Beren and Lúthien succeed. Also Feanor believed that the Light of the Trees he had trapped was his own, and he would not give them up even for the mending of Valinor, while Beren and Lúthien gave up the treasure for love. As to why I prefer using the symbol of Feanor rather than a symbol of the dark powers, is I don't believe that their are any orc-folk here. However one of my main reasons as I have said before, is that I would prefer to use a symbol that is not just from The Lord of the Rings, to separate this sub-reddit from all the other LOTR sub-reddits. I also think it would fit in stylistically with the elven letters at the top of the page."

I don't think that it is the one most recognisable symbol, just because there are to many from the book itself that are far more recognisable (the trees of valinor, the silmaril itself,...). Also, I don't think it was Beren and Lúthiens treasure to begin with, they never gave shit about it.  I can see your point about why you prefer Feanor over something pure evil. But, IMO, when you have two analogies for up and down, they naturally stand for good and bad. So why not use good and bad? And when I think of bad, I do not necessarily think of Feanor. Sure, he did bad things, but he also did good things. He ain't evil through and through. And Lúthien on the other hand isn't the most good thing there is. As I said, I prefer wisdom over beauty and love, here, in a place where we share not only our feelings (sometimes) but especially our thoughts. So you end up with not two things that are possible to use, but neither of them are good enough in my opinion. It's kind of difficult, I consider them (especially Feanor) too vague. I agree with using a symbol that is not from lotr (Manwe/Melkor for example). And I also think they fit stylistically, just not contextual."

An Elendil only took what he could when sailing to ME. Also it's men interpreting what other men said, who interpreted what elves said, who in turn tried to explain what were, perhaps metaphysical creation stories.

Affinity may come simply from love and friendship, which is likeness or affinity of fëa to fëa.  Urgency is imparted by great need of the “sender” (as in joy, grief or fear); and if these things are in any degree shared by the “receiver” the thought is the clearer received. Authority may also lend force to the thought of one who has a duty towards another, or of any ruler who has a right to issue commands or to seek the truth for the good of others. - Ósanwe-kenta   I think it's safe to say that, unlike the other members of the Fellowship, Galadriel had none of these three means available for strengthening the transmission of thoughts. At minimum with Hobbits, Men, and Elves she would share a greater affinity of hröa, and thus be more apt to communicate with them. Dwarves were such a separate entity to the other Children of Ilúvatar that she really had trouble reading him."
tolkienfans,3bovhm,GrimnirOdinson,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:13:39 2015 UTC,"However, I think that when Tolkien speaks of Authority (especially when capitalized) it's an Authority inherent to the being.  Galadriel seems to have a certain amount of Authority, likely due to her being one of the oldest Elves, and with strength enough to wield a Ring of Power; this may lend her an ability see something of Gimli's mind.  Gandalf, for another example, would have even greater Authority, being a Maia.  Thoughts, anyone else?"
tolkienfans,3bovhm,EyeceEyeceBaby,5,Thu Jul 2 21:19:13 2015 UTC,"Well Tolkien pretty much explained precisely what is meant in the quote above:   Authority may also lend force to the thought of one who has a duty towards another, or of any ruler who has a right to issue commands or to seek the truth for the good of others.   Gimli certainly doesn't fall under Galadriel's authority in the first scenario, though I agree he might be prone to her mind under the second."
tolkienfans,3bovhm,GrimnirOdinson,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:32:09 2015 UTC,"I must have read through that too quickly.  I think that the second scenario would be sufficient to read Gimli's mind (Galadriel's inherent, personal power aside)."
tolkienfans,3bovhm,Xecellseor,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:38:48 2015 UTC,Does a ruler not have the right to issue commands in her own land? Gimli may not have been one of her people but he was in her home.
tolkienfans,3bovhm,EyeceEyeceBaby,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:56:57 2015 UTC,"Well Tolkien lays out two scenarios for one to hold 'Authority':   'one who has duty toward another' 'any ruler who has a right to issue commands or to seek the truth for the good of others'   As I said above, Gimli has no duty to Galadriel, so he's out the first scenario. With Gimli she really only has the second scenario working for her, but I don't think Tolkien specified if all three (Affinity, Urgency & Authority) are required or any part of one will suffice. I imagine it varies by degrees depending upon the people involved, or be the level of expertise of the practitioner."
tolkienfans,3bovhm,Bio_Tonic,10,Wed Jul 8 14:52:04 2015 UTC,"Can you please elaborate the ""Clockwork Consciousnesses"" part? I do understand that when Aulë created the dwarves, he was unable to give them free-will so that they were just marionettes of Aulë will but, when Eru discovered Aulë creation, Eru himself gave them free-will and full consciousnesses."
tolkienfans,3bovhm,EyeceEyeceBaby,8,Wed Jul 1 13:58:16 2015 UTC,"I think it's more to do with the elements required to link two minds in thought. One of these is Affinity. Galadriel would have had the greatest Affinity to other elves, then to men, and the least Affinity to Dwarves. Elves and Men are both Children of Ilúvatar, where Dwarves are not counted as such, despite having fëar. The Affinity is less or nonexistent with Gimli and she was at a loss for him. See my comment here."
tolkienfans,3bovhm,AmbiguousAnonymous,3,Wed Jul 1 14:21:54 2015 UTC,"This is relevant too, I think.   But Ilúvatar spoke again and said: 'Even as I gave being to the thoughts of the Ainur at the beginning of the World, so now I have taken up thy desire and given to it a place therein; but in no other way will I amend thy handiwork, and as thou hast made it, so shall it be. But I will not suffer this: that these should come before the Firstborn of my design, nor that thy impatience should be rewarded. They shall sleep now in the darkness under stone, and shall not come forth until the Firstborn have awakened upon Earth; and until that time thou and they shall wait, though long it seem. But when the time comes I will awaken them, and they shall be to thee as children; and often strife shall arise between thine and mine, the children of my adoption and the children of my choice.'   Later there is a description of them as well."

The light of the Trees, down through Galadriel, in a sense.  I think his request gave the Elves pause, making them reconsider these dwarves. Legolas and Gimli are certainly closer afterwards."
tolkienfans,3bovhm,aristotle2600,73,Wed Jul 1 16:20:35 2015 UTC,"In the books, she basically said she didn't know what a dwarf would even want.  It's entirely possible that Tolkien set the scene up like that just for the request."
tolkienfans,3bovhm,AmbiguousAnonymous,31,Tue Jun 30 23:31:39 2015 UTC,"This is what the books say.  She basically just asks him what he wants without offering explanation, which I guess can be read as her not knowing.   ""And what gift would a Dwarf ask of the Elves?"" said Galadriel turning to Gimli.  ""There is nothing, Lady Galadriel,"" said Gimli, bowing low and stammering. `Nothing, unless it might be - unless it is permitted to ask, nay, to name a single strand of your hair, which surpasses the gold of the earth as the stars surpass the gems of the mine. I do not ask for such a gift. But you commanded me to name my desire.'  The Elves stirred and murmured with astonishment, and Celeborn gazed at the Dwarf in wonder, but the Lady smiled. 'It is said that the skill of the Dwarves is in their hands rather than in their tongues ' she said; `yet that is not true of Gimli. For none have ever made to me a request so bold and yet so courteous. And how shall I refuse, since I commanded him to speak? But tell me, what would you do with such a gift? '  ""Treasure it, Lady,"" he answered, ""in memory of your words to me at our first meeting. And if ever I return to the smithies of my home, it shall be set in imperishable crystal to be an heirloom of my house, and a pledge of good will between the Mountain and the Wood until the end of days.""  Then the Lady unbraided one of her long tresses, and cut off three golden hairs, and laid them in Gimli's hand. ""These words shall go with the gift,"" she said. ""I do not foretell, for all foretelling is now vain: on the one hand lies darkness, and on the other only hope. But if hope should not fail, then I say to you, Gimli son of Glóin, that your hands shall flow with gold, and yet over you gold shall have no dominion."""

tolkienfans,3bovhm,AnathemaMaranatha,32,Thu Jul 2 03:06:30 2015 UTC,"Consider: Lady Galadriel was a Noldo, but close kin to Thingol, king of Doriath, the only elf (known) to have married with a Maiar. Galadriel studied lore at the feet of Melian, and modeled Lothlorien after the fenced kingdom of Doriath.  There was a long-remembered and bitter memory between Dwarfs and Elves - not just one of those Noldor grudges - but all elves on middle earth. Thingol was recognized by all elves in Middle Earth (and indeed, by the Teleri in Aman) as King of the Elves.  He died at the hand of greedy dwarves (the Dwarves would tell a different story) defending the silmaril of Beren. His death led to Melian the Maiar foresaking Middle Earth and the sack of Doriath. The grief of that loss - and the revenge enacted upon the dwarves - persisted through eons, with both sides locked into a prideful and angry hostility at the perfidy of the other.  Hence the rough treatment Gimli received upon entering Lorien. Elves are immortal, but just as immortal is the memory of a grudge held by the Dwarves. By the time Gimli came to Lorien, Elves and Dwarves had been estranged for thousands of years - suspicious of each other and - might as well face it - held each other in some contempt. Lately some friendship had revived between the woods elves and the dwarf kingdom under the Lonely Mountain, but those elves were Avari. The High Elves had little use for dwarves. No wonder Gimli was so reluctant to enter Lorien.  And yet, in Lorien was Galadriel - student of Melian, last and most noble of the High Elves in Middle Earth. A dwarf had come into her guarded realm. She looked into his heart and saw everything she expected - quick anger, stubbornness, suspicion, violence and an alien way of thinking. She also saw a stone-hard loyalty to his companions beyond fear, hardship and death. She saw a strange, stubborn devotion to the dangerous and un-dwarflike task he had undertaken (throwing away gold!). She saw too that he was viewed as a friend by all of his companions, even an elf. She saw that he was not as blind as she imagined - that his love of stone and gold could expand wide enough to see the beauty wrought around him, to be dazzled by Galadriel herself.  What to do? Wise woman that she was, she didn't know. So she did the wisest thing - she asked.  I do not think she expected the answer she got. It was perfect, and I expect she recognized that. Though he could not know that he asked for a gift she had refused to Feanor himself, she could see that he had asked humbly, hoping to enshrine the beauty he saw in Lorien in a reflected, pure and ultimately cognizable dwarf beauty. She had to laugh. She was hoist on her own petard! He had asked for the highest gift, not knowing how high it was.  That gift of Galadriel was a kind of utterly perfect Tolkien moment. Eventually, Legolas would tell Gimli the significance of his gift. Even the dwarves had heard of Feanor. They held the Noldar in high esteem - most dwarflike of all the elves. I expect they agreed with every rash and bloody act of Feanor. (""Of course he burned the ships of his cousins. Fucking bastard had stolen his jewels! He had to go after him!"")  For dwarves and elves, the gift was a healing thing. No condescension by high-born, first-born elves. Just hospitality and a recognition of the value of the other across the great divide between the two races. Lovely really. Nicely plotted and written."
tolkienfans,3bovhm,EyeceEyeceBaby,7,Wed Jul 1 14:28:28 2015 UTC,"This is some amazing information, thanks for this write-up!"
tolkienfans,3bovhm,AnathemaMaranatha,6,Wed Jul 1 16:14:20 2015 UTC,"Two small things:   Thingol was recognized by all elves in Middle Earth (and indeed, by the Teleri in Aman) as King of the Elves.   Even the Noldor? They had their own succession of High Kings all the way through to the end of the Second Age. I don’t recall the Noldor as a people ever claiming Thingol as their king, or superior in any way to their own High King. Even Galadriel, who dwelt in Doriath rather than with her people in Nargothrond, attempted to hide the shameful acts the Noldor had committed from Thingol and Melian.    Lately some friendship had revived between the woods elves and the dwarf kingdom under the Lonely Mountain, but those elves were Avari. The High Elves had little use for dwarves.   Actually they elves in Mirkwood were Silvan, ruled by Sindar. Both Silvan and Sindarin elves are Eldar, not Avari. In later years some Avari spread west and mixed with them, but the realm was not founded as an Avarin one. Also, there were several centuries worth of close friendship between the Noldor (High Elves) in Eregion and the dwarves of Khazad-dûm. In fact, Galadriel and Celeborn dwelt in Eregion themselves before establishing their rule over Lorien. In Unfinished Tales suggests that Celeborn had much greater enmity for Dwarves than Galadriel (due to his kinship with Thingol) and that they may have even travelled through Khazad-dûm to arrive in Lorien.   Just to be clear, I think you’re right on with just about everything else. The significance of the act in light of the longstanding enmity between Elves and Dwarves really is a great moment in Tolkien’s legendarium.  Just wanted to add a bit to those two points."
tolkienfans,3bovhm,EyeceEyeceBaby,6,Wed Jul 1 17:36:18 2015 UTC,"Thank you. Correct on both points I think. The Noldor kind of danced around Thingol's authority. It's been a while since I was up on the differences between elvish tribes.   Yes, the elvish script on the door to Moria is testimony to the friendship between the Noldor and dwarves (say ""friend"" and enter). Not so much with the Noldor who were kin to Thingol. I got the impression that the friendship with the Elvish ringmakers was more of a comparative craft thing than a genuine reconciliation, but honestly I don't remember why I formed that impression."
tolkienfans,3bovhm,AnathemaMaranatha,3,Wed Jul 1 19:35:19 2015 UTC,"No worries, I am constantly double checking names of various groups of Elves as well. There's too many different classifications/tribes to keep track of. And I imagine your impression was fairly accurate in that the friendship was based on creativity and trade. The Noldor really are the most dwarflike Elves in that respect; they are craftsmen."
tolkienfans,3bovhm,EyeceEyeceBaby,3,Wed Jul 1 20:33:13 2015 UTC,"Noldor really are the most dwarflike Elves in that respect; they are craftsmen.   But even so, condescending and kind of snooty. I don't imagine dwarves liked that any more than men."

He saw an entire generation of men, boys really, thrown in to the maw for no real gains. It was pointless and tragic, and greatly influenced his writings.   You can see it in the imagery of the dead marshes, and in his distrust of industrialized societies. I think the quote that typifies his thinking is the one about the dead Haradrim soldier. Sam thinks:   “The enemy? His sense of duty was no less than yours, I deem. You wonder what his name is, where he came from. And if he was really evil at heart.

They are reduced to impotence. They are not specifically relegated to any location.   Most of the Maiar spirits that were evil turned evil pretty much right away.   This is noticeably not true with Sauron.   Is his choice final? Could he ever be pardoned by the Valar? Even Melkor was offered pardon, and he did far worse.   Sauron, too, was given the chance to offer himself up for judgement (this is, of course, not the same thing as being pardoned). Unfortunately for Saruman, his choice to go bad falls near the end of the time where the Valar are doing much of anything, and after they've learned through previous mistakes that  rehabilitation among their ranks doesn't accomplish much."
tolkienfans,3bkzec,Uluithiad,11,Tue Jun 30 02:07:59 2015 UTC,You could say that Saruman was offered pardon several times by Gandalf and later on also Frodo I believe. Everytime Saruman refused though.

Yet the lies that Melkor, the mighty and accursed, Morgoth Bauglir, the Power of Terror and of Hate, sowed in the hearts of Elves and Men are a seed that does not die and cannot be destroyed; and ever and anon it sprouts anew, and will bear dark fruit even unto the latest days."
tolkienfans,3bkzec,AmbiguousAnonymous,8,Tue Jun 30 12:21:44 2015 UTC,"This is an old concept, and no longer true. See Tolkien's argument to himself about it in Text VII of 'Myths Transformed' in Morgoth's Ring:   We read theat he was then thrust out into the Void. That should mean that he was put outside Time and Space, outside Ea altogether; but if that were so this would imply a direct intervention of Eru (with or without supplication of the Valar). It may however refer inaccurately* to the extrusion or flight of his spirit from Arda.   The footnote contains relevant information:   * Since the minds of Men (and even of the Elves) were inclined to confuse the 'Void', as a conception of the state of Not-being, outside Creation or Ea, with the conception of vast spaces within Ea, especially those conceived to lie all about the enisled 'Kingdom of Arda' (which we should probably call the Solar System)."
tolkienfans,3bkzec,Uluithiad,2,Tue Jun 30 16:36:58 2015 UTC,"Interesting.  I had always assumed that Melkor was an exception that maybe did warrant Eru's intervention, but am I correct in assuming he is in a type of 'purgatory,' not confined within Arda but still within Ea?  Here are the passages I think are relevant.     So came Tulkas the Strong, whose anger passes like a mighty wind, scattering cloud and darkness before it; and Melkor fled before his wrath and his laughter, and forsook Arda, and there was peace for a long age. And Tulkas remained and became one of the Valar of the Kingdom of Arda; but Melkor brooded in the outer darkness, and his hate was given to Tulkas for ever after.   and also   And Melkor knew of an that was done, for even then he had secret friends and spies among the Maiar whom he had converted to his cause; and far off in the darkness he was filled with hatred, being jealous of the work of his peers, whom he desired to make subject to himself. Therefore he gathered to himself spirits out of the halls of Eä that he had perverted to his service, and he deemed himself strong. And seeing now his time he drew near again to Arda, and looked down upon it, and the beauty of the Earth in its Spring filled him the more with hate.   and   Then Tulkas slept, being weary and content, and Melkor deemed that his hour had come. And he passed therefore over the Walls of the Night with his host, and came to Middle-earth far in the north; and the Valar were not aware of him.   It seems clear that he certainly is a special case that is capable of at least leaving Arda, and therefore I would say he is different than Sauron and Saruman in that he was relegated to a location, broadly being not Arda, although still Ea.  Does that make sense?"
tolkienfans,3bkzec,AmbiguousAnonymous,6,Tue Jun 30 17:01:50 2015 UTC,"Leaving Arda is not really a special case for Ainur. That's leaving Ea, and there's still none of that going on until you get to your last quote, which is using the Walls of Night. This was the Ea/Void boundary in old conceptions, but that is no longer the case. Here's a later version of your second quote to prove it:   Now Melkor knew all that was done; for even then he had secret friends among the Maiar, whom he had converted to his cause, whether in the first playing of the Ainulindale or afterwards in Ea. Of these the chief, as afterwards became known, was Sauron, a great craftsman of the household of Aule. Thus far off in the dark places of Ea, to which he had retreated, Melkor was filled with new hatred, being jealous of the work of his peers, whom he desired to make subject to himself. Therefore he gathered to himself spirits out of the voids of Ea who served him, until he deemed that he was strong, and seeing now his time he drew near to Arda again; and he looked down upon it, and the beauty of the Earth in its Spring filled him with wonder, but because it was not his, he resolved to destroy it.   He's explicitly still within Ea, even when he's outside Arda. He later pops over the Walls of Night with those he assembled, so they no longer have their original purpose of separating Ea from the Void, as Ea is expansive outside them."

Is there any evidence of other Valar leaving Arda, or even the corrupted Ainur leaving Arda without Melkor?

Sauron and Saruman on the other hand are still within Arda. Their loss of bodies (and Sauron's loss of power when the ring was destroyed) reduced them to impotent spirits but still residing in Arda."
tolkienfans,3bkzec,elenasto,2,Tue Jun 30 05:07:36 2015 UTC,"Morgoth was thus actually made captive in physical form, and in that form taken as a mere criminal to Aman and delivered to Námo Mandos as judge - and executioner. He was judged, and eventually taken out of the Blessed Realm and executed: that is killed like one of the Incarnates. It was then made plain (though it must have been understood beforehand by Manwë and Námo) that, though he had 'disseminated' his power (his evil and possessive and rebellious will) far and wide into the matter of Arda, he had lost direct control of this, and all that 'he', as a surviving remnant of integral being, retained as 'himself' and under control was the terribly shrunken and reduced spirit that inhabited his self-imposed (but now beloved) body. When that body was destroyed he was weak and utterly 'houseless', and for that time at a loss and 'unanchored' as it were. We read that he was then thrust out into the Void. That should mean that he was put outside of Time and Space, outside Eä altogether; but if that were so this would imply a direct intervention of Eru (with or without supplication of the Valar). It may however refer inaccurately to the extrusion or flight of his spirit from Arda.   From THoME X: Morgoth's Ring"

tolkienfans,3bkzec,Hq3473,2,Tue Jun 30 16:38:16 2015 UTC,"Apparently Tolkien discussed his fate in one of the letters, and that he had abandoned his mission to defeat Sauron in order to better focus on protecting birds, plants and animals.   However, Christopher Tolkien has said that it may not have been an abandonment. As a friend of Yavanna, patron Valar of Fruits and Growing Things, it's possible that his mission was always the protection of those things.

tolkienfans,3bkzec,Hq3473,2,Wed Jul 1 11:11:06 2015 UTC,"I think he could certainly go back.   The Ainur who were turned away had all turned to 'the dark side' in some way whereas Radagast was, at worst, guilty of becoming preoccupied. Moreover, Yavanna had begged for him to be sent as one of the emissaries, so it's possible that she had intended for him to primarily as an emissary to the birds and beasts and that's what he was doing. He definitely acted as an emissary to the Eagles.  So yeah, this is conjecture, but I think he certainly could go back but the question is whether he would. He's not mentioned as having taken the ships from the Grey Havens so it's possible he stayed in Arda, rather like Tom Bombadil."

You could get through it in two days without trying, it's a small enough read.  After that jump headfirst down the rabbit hole and start reading The Silmarillion. It underpins every other story in every other book.  In the likes of The Children Of Hurin, that entire book is one swift chapter of The Sil that had been condensed down to fit. You'll know the general plot, but it's still a great read."

tolkienfans,3bjslp,Melonskal,13,Tue Jun 30 09:36:52 2015 UTC,"Yes, very imporant!  Check the pronunciation guide in Appendix E before reading.  It doesn't spoil the story at all and you won't be tainted by the pronunciations you make up because you don't realize there are special rules.    For example, ""Celeborn"" is pronounced ""Keleborn"" and ""Cirdan"" is pronounced ""Keerdan.""  ""Minas Tirith"" should be ""Meenas Teereeth.""  ""Sauron"" should be SOWron, never SAWron.  It's really worth reading Appendix E before diving into the book, and consulting it any time you read a name other than hobbit names, which have been ""translated"" into contemporary 20th-century English.  I'm curious whether you will be able to read it with a clear mind, even without seeing the movies it's hard to avoid spoilers.  And with that in mind, please try to set aside any expectations you might have about the book, as hard as that might be.  Don't consult the internet for information while you are reading, you will get spoilers.  However, I would be interested in a report from time to time, what you think of it so far, that sort of thing.  And if you have a question, just make it clear that you would appreciate a spoiler-free answer.  If it's answered later in the story, we can just say ""read on and it will be answered.""  Every single word in the story was pondered carefully by Tolkien.  You can skip them and still enjoy the story.  But if someday you come back and read the story again, you will likely realize that you completely missed a really cool part of the story.  This often happens to the people who skip all the songs, also to people who skip the Prologue.  The book is often published in three volumes, but it is really six volumes or one, not three.  Although the story is not hard to follow, you might consider re-reading each of the six books before moving on to the next.  There's absolutely no need to do so, but you might be surprised at how pleasurable it is to read each book twice, and how much you missed the first time around."

tolkienfans,3bjslp,Grighund,6,Tue Jun 30 09:38:04 2015 UTC,"Also, just in case it was ambiguous because only two names were used anecdotally, ""C"" is always, without exception, pronounced as a ""K"" in Quenya (Elvish) dialects, and never as an ""S."" There is, in fact, no separate letter ""K"" in the language (though bear in mind we are talking about spelling their words with Latin characters, which is not how Elves write them).  I would attribute this to a desire to make Elvish appear softer than, say, Khuzdul (Dwarvish), which, using the Latin alphabet, makes heavy use of the letter ""K."" This is a pretty harsh letter, both visually and sonically, so Tolkien alleviates the visual by using ""C"" instead for Elvish."

Cirdan, however, didn't leave, he planned to abide in Middle Earth ""until the last ship sails"". We can assume that during the Fourth Age those realms got smaller and smaller.   Regarding the Avari, I would assume that by the end of the WotR there were few left. There is nothing really clear about them other than the fact that we know there were very many in the beginning and that Sauron spent most of the Second Age routing them out and slaughtering them and their realms one by one. Remember that by the end of the First Age there weren't many of the Noldor left and the Silvan elves in the North would have been greatly diminished, but by the end of the Second Age when the Last Alliance marched on Morder there were enough Elves for Elrond to say (at the Council of Elrond) that it made him recall the march on Thangorodim at the end of the First Age. So during the SA when Sauron was waging war on the Elves a lot of them went to Gil Galad (and Cirdan) at the Havens for security.

A Magister is more than a bachelor's degree but still less than a master's. I don't think there is a real equivalent in the US. The way it used to go here is Matura (when you finish school), Magister, Doktor, but all of that has been changing in the last couple of years as Austria is adopting the system of bachelor, master, doctor. A Diplomarbeit should be a real scientific paper that is well researched and sourced. This ends my short introduction to Austrian academia, I hope I could be of help :)"

tolkienfans,3bi0rh,mithwen_arataur,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:16:04 2015 UTC,"The thing is you Need a bachelor or Magister to be allowed into a Master program and you have to put in more work for the Master degree than for the Magister. I had to compare a lot because I cut it a bit close with my own Diplomarbeit and was in danger of needing to switch to the masters program which would have meant at least an additional year.   Tl;dr: A Masters degree Takes more work and time than the old Magister, That's why I said they're not exactly the same."

tolkienfans,3bi0rh,GrimnirOdinson,2,Mon Jun 29 20:34:09 2015 UTC,"On page 16, it is noted that the Viking Age ended in 1066 with the battle of Stamford Bridge.  It was only about a week after that, I believe, that William the Conqueror began his successful invasion of Britain from Normandy.  This invasion was successful in part because the British army was at this point tired and underfunded.  Normandy was a Viking settlement in France, and ""Norman"" would mean ""Northman.""  So the Vikings were successful in their conquest, after a fashion.  It should also be noted that this successful conquest introduced some the English language's quirks.

tolkienfans,3bhfmq,InTheAtticToTheLeft,26,Mon Jun 29 06:30:01 2015 UTC,I assume Bilbo drew the maps based upon many smaller local maps which were made by various people.

tolkienfans,3bhfmq,AmbiguousAnonymous,4,Mon Jun 29 13:18:49 2015 UTC,"But by that rational it must have been an elf that originally drew them, and Bilbo simply copied them down.

You are one google search away if ever in doubt!"
tolkienfans,3bhfmq,AmbiguousAnonymous,16,Tue Jun 30 01:44:25 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind the conceit of Tolkien's books: that they weren't written by Tolkien.  The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings+Appendices and The Adventures of Tom Bombadil were supposed to have been written by Bilbo and Frodo (with contributions from others) and simply translated by Tolkien into English. In that light it's clear that all of the maps in these books are reproductions of Bilbo and Frodo's maps, which in turn were likely taken from copies in Rivendell.  The Silmarillion map of Beleriand is a slightly different story. Again we have the conceit of someone other than Tolkien writing the story, but in the published version we get no reference to him. Ælfwine (or Eriol) was an Anglo-Saxon mariner and descendant of Eärendil. Early in the 10th Century AD, he set sail westward and inadvertently found the Straight Road west to Tol Eressëa. There he learned all of the lore we see in The Silmarillion and some of the other works in the legendarium. Eventually he returned to England and translated the works to Old English. Again we can assume that Tolkien's map was a reproduction of Ælfwine's, who in turn was using the maps of the elves in Tol Eressëa (specifically Pengolodh the loremaster) as a source.  As for the Thror's map, yes it was written by some other character under a specified moon, but the copy included in the Red Book (and therefore The Hobbit) was simply that, a copy (not the original) and would have been produced by Bilbo.    Edit: The most likely framework for The Silmarillion is that Bilbo translated it, the Ælfwine framework was abandoned. In that case Bilbo is also responsible for the Beleriand map, via his access to the Elvish source material in Rivendell."
tolkienfans,3bhfmq,EyeceEyeceBaby,3,Mon Jun 29 13:27:00 2015 UTC,"I think the Sil, at least in its later forms, is intended to be Bilbo's work as well. Made in conjunction with the Red Book. After all he spends a great deal of time with primary sources of the lore of the First Age.  There's even a scene where Bilbo and Aragorn write a poem for Earendil, showing that Bilbo was at least interested in the subject matter. I think there's more direct indications as well, but I don't recall them offhand."
tolkienfans,3bhfmq,PrivateChicken,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:07:04 2015 UTC,"I'd be curious to see some of the more direct references to this. I wasn't aware of anything of the sort. I don't think the poem by Bilbo is a particularly strong reference to his authoring The Silmarillion, perhaps even the opposite given the style of the poem itself. (Not to mention Aragorn seemed to find it quite presumptuous of Bilbo to lyricize Eärendil's tale in the son of Eärendil's house.)   I always felt the writing styles of all three works matched quite well with their authors: The Hobbit is lighthearted and at times tongue-in-cheek, just like Bilbo's poetry. The Lord of the Rings is a bit more serious as I would expect Frodo's writing to be. And The Silmarillion sounds almost archaic at times (not unlike Tolkien's prose translation of Beowulf), as I would expect from an Anglo-Saxon writer. That was something I also always found interesting about Tolkien's idea that he was simply translating other authors' works; it explains the diverse styles of writing he employed."
tolkienfans,3bhfmq,EyeceEyeceBaby,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:40:33 2015 UTC,"Hm, I should have be more specific, Bilbo isn't the author, but the transcriber and translator into Westron. So the prose and poetry isn't necessarily original to Bilbo, as is the case with is Earendil song, but he is the intended link between us and the Silmarillion, as opposed to Ælfwine."
tolkienfans,3bhfmq,PrivateChicken,3,Tue Jun 30 15:47:28 2015 UTC,"I stand corrected. Christopher puts it quite plainly in the Foreword to the Book of Lost Tales 1:   The letter of 1963 quoted above shows my father pondering the mode in which the legends of the Elder Days might be presented. The original mode, that of The Book of Lost Tales, in which a Man, Eriol, comes after a great voyage over the ocean to the island where the Elves dwell and learns their history from their own lips, had (by degrees) fallen away. When my father died in 1973 ‘The Silmarillion’ was in a characteristic state of disarray: the earlier parts much revised or largely rewritten, the concluding parts still as he had left them some twenty years before; but in the latest writing there is no trace or suggestion of any ‘device’ or ‘framework’ in which it was to be set. I think that in the end he concluded that nothing would serve, and no more would be said beyond and explanation of how (within the imagined world) it came to be recorded.  In the original edition of The Lord of the Rings Bilbo gave to Frodo at Rivendell as his parting gift ‘some books of lore that he had made at various times, written in his spidery hand, and labelled on their red backs: Translations from Elvis, by B.B.’ In the second edition (1966) ‘some books’ was changed to ‘three books’, and in the Note on the Shire Records added to the Prologue in that edition my father said that the content of ‘the three large volumes bound in red leather’ was preserved in that copy of the Red Book of Westmarch which was made in Gondor by the King’s Writer Findegil in the year 172 of the Fourth Age; and also that  These three volumes were found to be a work of great skill and learning in which…[Bilbo] had used all the sources available to him in Rivendell, both living and written. But since they were little used by Frodo, being almost entirely concerned with the Elder Days, no more is said of them here.   In The Complete Guide to Middle-earth Robert Forster says: ‘Quenta Silmarillion was no doubt one of Bilbo’s Translations from the Elvish preserved in the Red Book of Westmarch.’ So also have I assumed: the ‘books of lore’ that Bilbo gave to Frodo provided in the end the solution: they were ‘The Silmarillion’. But apart from the evidence cited here, there is, so far as I know, no other statement on this matter anywhere in my father’s writings; and (wrongly, as I think now) I was reluctant to step into the breach and make definite what I only surmised.   He goes on like this discussing the general complexity and problematic nature of putting together The Silmarillion for several more pages. I guess I just loved the idea of Ælfwine venturing to Tol Eressëa in the 10th century because it felt like it connected the work to a much more recent time. In any case, good call. If Christopher eventually came to that conclusion based upon the textual evidence then it's close enough to canon for me. Probably more accurate to what JRRT intended in the end than the older Ælfwine framework in any case."

tolkienfans,3bfu0g,Megaskiboy,53,Sun Jun 28 21:14:13 2015 UTC,"After, in my opinion. Lord of the Rings is a somewhat easier book to read, so I think reading that and then the Silmarillion would be better. The Silmarillion is wonderful, but it reads like a history book sometimes. You can go back and put the events of LoTR in context as you read the Silmarillion, you don't need to know all the history first. It will also help put you in the mind frame of the hobbits, who don't know all the history and mythology. One of my favorite things about Lord of the Rings is the sense that there is something greater going on that you can't quite grasp ..."
tolkienfans,3bfu0g,pterodactyl111,11,Sun Jun 28 21:19:59 2015 UTC,"I would recommend The Lord of the Rings first.

tolkienfans,3bfu0g,zeenies,9,Sun Jun 28 21:20:16 2015 UTC,"I would suggest reading the LotR first - it's definitely more accessible. The Silmarillion is incredible, but I think without reding the LotR first I wouldn't have been as invested. For me, Tolkien created an amazing world in the LotR that had me wanting more and lead me to read the Silmarillion, Unfinished Tales, etc.  While the Silmarillion is a creation story (and therefore happens before the events of the LotR), I don't think you need that background to enjoy the LotR."
tolkienfans,3bfu0g,Orangemenace13,19,Sun Jun 28 21:43:58 2015 UTC,"After. Its style can be incredibly hard to get used to, especially if you jump into it straight from The Hobbit.

If the Hobbit is the first step out the doorstep, LOTR is the wonderful journey that takes you to that world. The Silmarillion is the end goal you could say, the warm fire at the end of an epic journey; tales from another age that will fill you with wonderment as you uncover the mysteries behind the LOTR. If that's your thing, I would even suggest reading LOTR twice before heading into the rest of Tolkien's works.  I envy you and wish I could start the journey anew, with fresh eyes. :)"

tolkienfans,3bfu0g,SuzyQ78,2,Mon Jun 29 02:17:51 2015 UTC,"The LotR books contain a lot of references to the Silmarillion you won't get if you read LotR first. Still, I would read LotR first as it is a very good introduction to the world. Then read the Silmarillion, and then re-read LotR and you will notice many little details that you suddenly understand.  One of the fun things of reading Lotr for the first time is that don't have a clue what some people are talking about. When Aragorn tells of Beren and Lúthien, or when Bilbo sings of Eärendil, you will hear the stories for the first time as if you were a little Hobbit in Middle-earth. When you later read the Silmarillion you will know why these people were important.  The Silmarillion also has the explanation of who Gandalf is, where the Eagles come from, where Dwarves and Dragons come from. It takes away somewhat of the mystery of reading LotR for the first time."
tolkienfans,3bfu0g,ReinierPersoon,2,Mon Jun 29 03:27:53 2015 UTC,"It depends on how you like to approach a book.  I first read LotR in the 60's, and then I made my friends read it. Then we spent many late nights for about 15 years trying to figure out things you will already know if you read The Silmarillion first.   Actually, even without reading  it first, you probably know much more than we knew, because it is easily available knowledge. But I'm glad I had a chance to try and figure things out for myself. Being wrong about things didn't make trying to solve the puzzles less fun.  If you like to know everything beforehand, then you should go with The Silmarillion first."

If I remember correctly, he tried to get an early copy of The Silmarillion published after the success of The Hobbit but it was rejected because the prose was so different and it read more like old English. As a matter of fact, he wanted to publish The Silmarillion and  LOTR together but the publishing house still wasn't interested.

You could also look at one or two sieges of Constantinople, which fits in with the Arnor/Numenor=Rome Gondor=Byzantium parallel.  You could even compare it to Stalingrad, where the Germans got over-confident and laid siege to a city, only to get cut off and surrounded in the field; it was even followed up by a later action where the ""allies"" form a defensive salient on an open plain (like the Kursk Salient) inviting the enemy to attack, which ended up being the turning point in both wars, although for very different reasons."

tolkienfans,3b7api,unilurch,3,Fri Jun 26 18:19:17 2015 UTC,"Wow- never realized it but this is a good point. Also, Theodoric was the son of Alaric- perhaps the most famous gothic king, who first entered Italy and did the great sack of Rome in 410. In that way he is similair to Eomer and most rulers of the mark in general, as patriarchal history and the deeds of ancestors are very important and often cited by Rohirrim kings, such as the many references to Eorl in LotR. Theodoric and Theoden (wow, just noticed those names are awfully alike) are very similair as they are both foreign kings riding to the aide of an older and historically more dominant empire thats in a steep decline.   I disagree with OP's parallel between Aetius and Aragorn, rather, i think Aetius is much more similair to Faramir. Without the foreign help, neither would have survived, and much like Aetius, Faramir is oftentimes distrusted and disliked by his ruler Denethor. Also in the time between Denethor's suicide and Elessar's crowning, Faramir is the last true Steward of Gondor (by virtue and birth), just as many say that Aetius was the last true Roman."

Almost everything we know about Gondor is in the east or middle but he did mention a few groups of soldiers from Pinnath Gelin and Anfalas coming to Minas Tirith to defend. Tolkien never named any settlements in those huge tracts of land but judging from the soldiers there must have been a decent amount of villages there. Perhaps it was a ""wild frontier"" with small villages which got scarcer and scarcer the further west/away from the coast you traveled.   I might have rambled a bit there but that is what I love so much about Tolkiens world, he left a rigid framework which you can fill in with your imagination."

tolkienfans,3b6oi9,fileg,3,Fri Jun 26 14:20:12 2015 UTC,Indeed. Leaving the actual events vague adds to the mystery of the whole situation and serves to create a really ancient feel to it.
tolkienfans,3b6oi9,rainmaninjapan,15,Fri Jun 26 15:51:31 2015 UTC,"Mannish habitation of the area goes back to the First Age.  When Men arrived in Beleriand they had arrived from much further east, leaving settlements in many places along the road.  That included burial mounds on the Barrow-downs.  When in the Second Age Númenóreans came to Middle-earth they recognized many peoples there as kin to them; the barrows were accepted as part of their own ancient heritage.  From Of Dwarves and Men, volume 12 of The History of Middle-earth:   [...] Their term Middle Men was thus originally applied to Men of Eriador, the most westerly of Mankind in the Second Age and known to the Elves of Gil-galad's realm.  At that time there were many men in Eriador, mainly, it would seem, in origin kin of the Folk of Bëor, though some were kin of the Folk of Hador.  They dwelt about Lake Evendim, in the North Downs and the Weather Hills, and in the lands between as far as the Brandywine, west of which they often wandered though they did not dwell there.  They were friendly with the Elves, though they held them in awe and close friendships between them were rare.  Also they feared the Sea and would not look upon it. [...]   So I suppose Tom referred to Mannish settlements and realms going back to the First Age.  To him Arnor and its later divisions were but the so far last part of the Mannish history in the area.  That history may be broadly divided in three parts: before Númenóreans arrived, the re-mingling of Númenóreans and the earlier population, and Arnor."

tolkienfans,3b2ytr,ScallopOolong,29,Thu Jun 25 15:36:03 2015 UTC,"For the first part of the Lord of the Rings make yourself like Théoden when he finally gets the chance to while away the hours chatting with Merry, forgetting the grand epic and enjoying small pleasures.  The first part is something like Gandalf says to Théoden when first meeting Merry and Pippin at the ruins of Isengard:   [Merry talking to Théoden] '...It was Tobold Hornblower, of Longbottom in the Southfarthing, who first grew the true pipe-weed in his gardens, about the year 1070 according to our reckoning. How old Toby came by the plant...'  'You do not know your danger, Théoden,' interrupted Gandalf. 'These hobbits will sit on the edge of ruin and discuss the pleasures of the table, or the small doings of their fathers, grandfathers, and great-grandfathers, and remoter cousins to the ninth degree, if you encourage them with undue patience.   And after talk about Treebeard:   [Théoden] 'Farewell, my hobbits! May we meet again in my house! There you shall sit beside me and tell me all that your hearts desire: the deeds of your grandsires, as far as you can reckon them; and we will speak also of Tobold the Old and his herb-lore. Farewell!'  The hobbits bowed low. 'So that is the King of Rohan!' said Pippin in an undertone. 'A fine old fellow. Very polite.'   So that's my advice when starting the Lord of the Rings: Be like Théoden at leisure."
tolkienfans,3b2ytr,Melonskal,8,Thu Jun 25 18:48:25 2015 UTC,"This is an absolutely great comment, thank you! There is a lot of commentary about the benefits of the simple way of life of the Hobbits I feel in these books"
tolkienfans,3b2ytr,nycnewsjunkie,7,Thu Jun 25 19:11:45 2015 UTC,"I guess compared to the Silmarillion the actions of the characters might seem a bit insignificant but you have to keep in mind that the Vala (I think at least) won't intervene again. This pretty much means that if Sauron were to get the ring he would be impossible to defeat.  Still, the books are amazing literary works with beutiful descriptions and interesting songs."
tolkienfans,3b2ytr,GrimnirOdinson,3,Thu Jun 25 15:51:59 2015 UTC,"That really is true, although I always wondered what would have happened if Sauron had won.  Think about it this way, Illuvatar created Arda for beauty and for creation. If Sauron and thus ""evil"" had won to me that would be the end of the first coming and Illuvatar would intervene to create another world anew. I call it the first coming because there is in the book referenced the ""second coming"", that is the mystery that was withheld even from Manwe on where men go after they die"
tolkienfans,3b2ytr,jstock23,6,Thu Jun 25 16:10:45 2015 UTC,"Just to quote the opening chapter as to maybe an idea of what occurs when Arda is finally lost:   ""Never since have the Ainur made any music like to this music, though it has been said that a greater still shall be made before Iluvatar by the chrois of the Ainur and the Children of Iluvatar after the end of days"""
tolkienfans,3b2ytr,slappytheclown,4,Thu Jun 25 16:23:00 2015 UTC,In a certain sense Sauron could not win.  Tolkiens view expressed in the Simarillion through Melkor's efforts to ruin the song was in the end the works of evil could only serve to enhance the final results.
tolkienfans,3b2ytr,dannaz423,4,Thu Jun 25 18:43:48 2015 UTC,"Hm thats an interesting way of putting it! That quote is particularly powerful because it does suggest that Ilúvatar is (obviously some might say) always in control. Still it brings to rise my question of the phrasing ""at the end"" such that he may have created some final paradise, perhaps even in a way that the events of the ages we read are but a moment passing for him so he does not intervene."
tolkienfans,3b2ytr,MJWood,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:02:34 2015 UTC,"Except, I believe that Tolkien insinuated that Iluvatar did slightly intervene in the destruction of the Ring.  If I am mistaken, please correct me."
tolkienfans,3b2ytr,TheKiltedStranger,5,Thu Jun 25 19:10:41 2015 UTC,"That's such a bad way of looking at things! Reading the Silmarillion only adds to the Hobbit and LotR, it doesn't make them worse. You see what they are really fighting for, the insurmountable challenge. Not only that but it's more relatable to the reader.  While the Silmarillion may have the Valar raising and felling whole mountains, there is little to relate to. These are immortal beings and even great creation and destruction are only proportional to their power. In the stories of men we can really see that their actions are extreme for their capability. Their valor in the face of everything, including the Valar themselves. The power of the Valar rests mostly in paradise while they eternally mourn that which was."
tolkienfans,3b2ytr,TheKiltedStranger,2,Fri Jun 26 01:22:36 2015 UTC,"You should also now read ""Children of Hurin"" for a heart-wrenching expanded version of the Hurin/Turin story."

tolkienfans,3b2ytr,Hq3473,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:29:34 2015 UTC,"They are insignificant in scale to The Sil for sure, but that's kind of the point. It's about Hobbits after all, but what they do ends up being huge to them and to the world."
tolkienfans,3b2ytr,Hq3473,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:38:35 2015 UTC,"It's the same story. :)  But your saying LOTR was insignificant reminded me of this:  “There, peeping among the cloud-wrack above a dark tower high up in the mountains, Sam saw a white star twinkle for a while. The beauty of it smote his heart, as he looked up out of the forsaken land, and hope returned to him. For like a shaft, clear and cold, the thought pierced him that in the end the Shadow was only a small and passing thing: there was light and high beauty for ever beyond its reach.”  The story of the shadow of Sauron is only a small and insignificant episode in the whole story of Arda. And the star Sam sees is only a fraction of the full glory of the stars Varda put in the sky. I believe Tolkien wrote the Silmarillion in abbreviated form, and spent so many decades writing and re-writing the stories around it, because he almost could not put the full glory of his vision on the page."

tolkienfans,3b2ytr,nycnewsjunkie,3,Thu Jun 25 15:44:22 2015 UTC,"Encouraging people to read the Silmarillion. Surely a noble deed!  If you're into that kind of thing, check out the elvish bits at the end of the book, they're interesting in their own way. And if you like that, there's the Etymologies in the back of Unfinished Tales. That's much more in depth and just a treat to add depth to the universe."
tolkienfans,3b2ytr,nycnewsjunkie,2,Thu Jun 25 15:55:05 2015 UTC,Oh yeah the Etymology of Elvish in the back of the book just makes me realise how well thought out it was! And the maps and family trees were so useful to keep understanding the story and characters. Like I was shocked to realise Galadriel (who I knew from the films) actually saw and lived in the holy lands!
tolkienfans,3b2ytr,midwayfair,7,Thu Jun 25 16:48:15 2015 UTC,"You might consider reading The Silmarillion again before moving on to The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings.  It's a bit obsessive but I guarantee you will pick up many things you missed if you read it again.  Alternatively, read The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings and then start the whole cycle over again.  When you get to The Lord of the Rings, I would be interested in any posts about references to The Silmarillion.  Sometimes they are subtle, sometimes not, but I've never met someone who read The Silmarillion first and I would be interested in how that affects your first reading of The Lord of the Rings.  The Hobbit has fewer direct references to The Silmarillion.  Instead, it borrows some names and concepts, to the point where you might recognize some of the characters or items as almost plagiarized from The Silmarillion -- except of course that Tolkien had every right to borrow from his own unpublished work.  But there was little conscious attempt to work The Hobbit into the same timeline as The Silmarillion.  That didn't happen until Tolkien tried to meld both worlds in The Lord of the Rings."
tolkienfans,3b2ytr,morcotulco,3,Thu Jun 25 17:06:14 2015 UTC,"Well unfortunately (in the sense that maybe I ruined it) I did some searching before making this post and found this post. Have a look at it, there really are so many references that only someone having read the Silmarillion would get since they are subtle  And yes I definitely want to re-read it, admittedly I skipped over a LOT of the geography stuff, in particular there is one chapter just describing page on page what the land was like and how it was divided."
tolkienfans,3b2ytr,sdb2754,5,Thu Jun 25 16:02:56 2015 UTC,"Those are direct references, there are many more indirect references.  For example, having read The Silmarillion, you know that Manwe is associated with the winds and the Great Eagles.  Now pay attention to the role of the winds and Great Eagles in The Lord of the Rings, and contemplate whether Manwe is passive or active in the War of the Rings.  There is no right answer, but there are lots of hints.  Similarly, having read The Silmarillion, you know that characters have prophetic dreams while sleeping near water, which is associated with Ulmo.  Now keep track of prophetic dreams or visions in the proximity of water in The Lord of the Rings, and contemplate whether Ulmo is passive during the War of the Ring.  Having read The Silmarillion, you know that Varda is associated with the stars, and also with hearing.  Now keep track of the role of the stars and singing and prayers in The Lord of the Rings, and contemplate whether Varda is passive during the War of the Ring.  I would argue that there are hints the rest of the Valar also may take an active interest in the War of the Ring as well, but I will let you look for those clues yourself."
tolkienfans,3b2ytr,sdb2754,2,Thu Jun 25 16:13:32 2015 UTC,"Wow, thats a really cool thought actually. I'd like to think that if the Eagles are a big part of the LOTR series (which from the film I gather they are) then it is more of an indirect action by Manwe. As in the Eagles were made during a time where the Valar did actively involve themselves in Middle Earth and perhaps since they are an extension of him their help in the War of the Rings is holding to his compassion and willingness to help before the betrayals"
tolkienfans,3b2ytr,thebeef24,3,Thu Jun 25 16:22:53 2015 UTC,"Tolkien never confirms or denies the role of the Valar in The Lord of the Rings.  But I'm convinced they take a very active role, and the clues are there."

Makes it more significant if you know where Saruman came from. These little sentences make little sense if you don't know the history. There is so much in the books you'll miss on first reading if you read them in the standard order.  Quite a few things are very different from the movies, that's another reason to read them. Saruman is killed off fairly early in the films, in the books he still has a role to play.  And some characters are also in the Silmarillion of course, such as Círdan, Elrond, Galadriel, Glorfindel. If you liked Silm you'll probably like the appendices at the end of LotR as well. It has background on the Dwarves, and a timeline. I would read the book first though, appendices are spoilerish. I would also read the foreword or prologue, it gives some exposition on the Shire and the Hobbits. It's very clear that these people are not the powerful heroes of the First Age, but a bunch of people who prefer gardening and drinking ale.  Another thing that is somewhat different from the films is the class divide. Frodo, Merry and Pippin are from important families while Sam is not."
tolkienfans,3b2ytr,Intergalactic62,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:42:48 2015 UTC,"That is exactly the sort of example as to why I hope reading the Sil first is a good choice! Saruman looking to the west is such an important and telling action, as if he now realises he is going to face judgement and reckoning from the Valar for all that he did on Middle Earth. So definitely powerful if you understand it like you said!  I can see slowly the charm that people have with LOTR (who are more familiar with the other Tolkien books too). Its almost as if he wrote it as a comedy and a total juxtaposition to all of the other stories of the series where brave men of huge importance willingly ride into war. On the contrary the hobbits and frodo barely even want to do anything, there is a certain humour to that haha!"
tolkienfans,3b2ytr,hhowk,2,Sat Jun 27 00:29:01 2015 UTC,Those references to the Sil in LotR is great to experience for the first time in LotR because it makes the world have so much depth that you want to explore but it isn't really explained in LotR.

Also, the claim in your top level comment that ""Most dangerous place in M-E"" rankings go 1. Moria, 2. Old Forest, 3. Mordor is pulled straight from the theory and is equally inaccurate. Moria is certainly a dangerous place (both with and without the balrog), but Gandalf seemed content with attempting Moria. Indeed he preferred it to the pass and Aragorn was the one most fearful of it, pushing instead to attempt Caradhras first. They very nearly made it the whole way through without much trouble. The fact is ""dangerous"" is far too ambiguous a term to give any kind of ranking. If I had to assign that label anywhere it would probably be any of the skirmishes or battles that occurred during the War of the Ring. Certainly they caused the greatest loss of life. The Hobbits give evidence that one can certainly survive at least a few days in the Old Forest and Moria, and if one found one-self in Mordor at the time (without an army) you'd be more likely to be captured than killed (as evidenced by Frodo's captivity) which isn't particularly life-threatening. Captors typically have an interest in keeping captives alive...otherwise they would simply have killed them."

tolkienfans,3b32y8,EyeceEyeceBaby,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:26:02 2015 UTC,"If that's really the case we're left with two options:  A. Gandalf doesn't really know anything about Bombadil either, he's just forcing the issue of destroying the Ring by dismissing Bombadil as an alternative.  or   B. Gandalf does know a good deal about Tom's true nature, but he's preferring ambiguity and half-truth's for an undisclosed reason.  In case A, Gandalf becomes a suddenly more manipulative figure. He prefers to only take steps that he is sure of. If that's the case I begin to wonder if a great deal more that was to come was in actuality all according to some sort of plan he had.  In case B, we can advance that livejournal theory one step further. Now Gandalf's ""it doesn't matter what you think, he's not interested"" is nothing more than a cover up for Bombadil. Not only is Bombadil an immensely powerful force for evil, but Gandalf is in on it and is protecting him. In fact he acts essentially as Tom's proxy in the world outside the Old Forest, orchestrating the downfall of the only other being who could really stand up to Tom. Of course, since we have no clue why he would withhold information about Tom, this is all speculation. ;-)"

Her hair is like her mother's - long and thick, able to spread over the surface of water to calm it. This is in several of the Histories, as long as you care to really look, and is all but Word of God as far as the truth goes.  The Elven kingdoms and domains being like their guardians is a bit of a stretch. Greenwood became Mirkwood because of the descendants of Ungoliant and Shelob, the orcs and goblins of the Misty Mountains and the mountains beyond Mirkwood(which are most likely where the remnants of Melkor's stronghold are), and Sauron and likely the Witch-King being resident not very far from there. Even as all the Elves were leaving it was still not a very safe place - still dangerous. Imladris was created after the ring was entrusted to Elrond. The orcs and trolls and other creatures of Sauron literally have no idea that it's there. They know OF it, but they can never find it, not even by following patrols or travel groups. Lothlórien was similarly shrouded, but after the ring came to Galadriel. She could protect it, but only with the help of her border-guard and even then it was extremely vulnerable, more so than Thranduil's halls, which were expanded out of caves. The Grey Havens had similar protection to the Shire - Círdan gave his ring to Gandalf, after all. It was just too far removed from everything to be worth anything as a target. And we all know what happened to Doriath and Nargothrond and Gondolin.  And as for Tom... Tom himself was always a bit of an enigma, but Tolkien stated that ""the Ring influences anything and everything of this earth"". This implies that Tom himself is not of the Circles of the World. That he is, in fact, Not Really There. Even Manwe, once he committed himself to the Flame Imperishable in the Void, was ""of Arda"". This, too, implies that Tom is only an avatar of something that truly lives beyond the world. Now, the only things that live Beyond the World are the remainder of the Ainur who did not choose to live their Song...and Eru, called Illúvatar. The only being powerful enough to create such a seeming beyond the Void which separates the halls the Valar came from and Middle Earth...is Eru. He has done so on several occasions, most notably to Aulë the Smith after he created the Dwarves, to give them true life. What if he never left? At least, that was my reasoning, and there is, I am told, a bit of truth to it."
tolkienfans,3b32y8,Fluffyerthanthou,3,Fri Jun 26 21:28:59 2015 UTC,"I've always thought Tom was the secret fire, or some manifestation of it.

I was told something along the lines of ""there is the Trinity: the Fire of Life inside all things, inside the world; the One who called it into being and stays Himself beyond it; and He who Limits Himself to an existence Inside the Fire, knowing very little beyond what is known there"".  Also, outside of what I know: consider his supposed other name. ""Iarwain ben-Adar"". What does that name mean? For all names mean something, or else Tolkein would not have created them. As for the meaning of ""Iarwain"", I am not certain and cannot at the moment check. I have lost much of what I knew about Tom in a series of accidents with technology. But ""ben-Adar""? That is ""son of (the) father"". Speaking of strictly factual history, many scholars - secular and religious - now believe that the figure known as ""Bar Abbas"" or ""Barabbas"" was Jesus. It is an Arabic name-of-sorts meaning ""son of the father"". The New Testament of the Bible was, after all, written hundreds of years after the events in question, comes mostly from sources written about 200 years after the events in question, and the content was VOTED on by a council of hidebound, conservative, crotchety old men.  Tom Bombadil may not be the true Eru Illúvatar, but he is some form of His consciousness, something I have believed for a very long time, longer than my current knowledge of him."

Some decided to, and some stayed behind. This was the first Sundering. Along the way some turned back at various points (second and third Sundering) and again some continued on.  This is the main difference between the groups of Elves.   In Rivendell there is a large population of those Elves who went all the way to Valinor, then returned to Middle'earth to wage war against Morgoth. These are the Noldor.  Lorien is largely Sindar and Silvan (with some Sindar), elves that started the journey but stayed behind in Middle-earth.  Mirkwood is largely Silvan Elves who turned back ealier than the Sindar (Second Sundering).  Galadriel though is Noldor, and Legolas and his family are Sindar.    http://img-fan.theonering.net/~rolozo/images/lovett/division.gif  Edit: I would give The Silmarillion a try if you're more interested.

Rivendell did indeed have probably the largest population of Noldor still remaining in Middle-Earth but there were a good deal of Sindar mixed in. Additionally, Lorien was actually a Silvan kingdom. It was a similar setup to Mirkwood/Greenwood in that the Noldor (Galadriel)/Sindar (Celeborn) ruled over a Silvan people. Amdír, the first recorded Lord of Lothlorien was a Sinda, but he arrived from Beleriend to rule the Silvan elves already there.  Edit: Replied then saw the edit ;-)"

Eregion was almost completely Noldorin, though I think it's plausible that since Celeborn and Galadriel were the initial rulers there, Celeborn may have brought some Sindar with him. Lothlórien was a Silvan region which eventually was settled by some Sindar as well.

Melian was a Maia and therefore neither term would apply to her (quendi meaning ""elves"").  Calaquendi and Moriquendi are therefore somewhat separate from the various elvish clans. They are simply adjectives describing whether or not an elf had been in Valinor during the Years of the Trees (i.e. had seen the light of the Two Trees). All Vanyar, Noldor (except those born in Middle-Earth), and Falmari (Teleri who completed the journey to Valinor) are Calaquendi. All Sindar and Nandor (including the Silvan elves) were both Eldar, and Moriquendi as they had begun the journey but never saw the light of the Trees.  An interesting little factoid about your flair (Thingol) is that he is the only elf who is both Umanyar (did not complete the Great Journey) but is also Calaquendi because he was one of the original ambassadors who visited Valinor prior to the Journey."
tolkienfans,3b2exb,EyeceEyeceBaby,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:00:19 2015 UTC,"All very interesting, I'm assuming a lot of this is from the Histories of Middle Earth.

I always thought that's why they were ""Grey Elves"" because they were in between ""Elves of the Light"" and ""Elves of Darkness."""
tolkienfans,3b2exb,uhhohspaghettio,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:01:28 2015 UTC,"No, it is because Thingol together with the leaders of the Noldor and Vanyar is taken to Valinor and shown the Trees, before being sent back to their peoples to convince them to go to Valinor.

tolkienfans,3b2exb,TraptorMaximum,2,Thu Jun 25 23:16:52 2015 UTC,"We simply don't know.   Tolkien wasn't terribly interested in those sorts of details.  And by the Third Age, the few cultural differences that /are/ noted in the Silmarillion and HoME are not necessarily relevant to the hybrid cultures of the remaining elven strongholds and are in some cases directly contradictory. For example the nomadic elves in the Silmarillion are silvan, but in LotR the only wandering elves we meet are led by the (most likely) Noldorin Gildor, while the silvan elves are all tied to the various realms.  Also keep in mind that we aren't talking about towns here, exactly.  Rivendell is somewhere between a self-sufficient feudal estate and a minor medieval city-state; Lothlorien seems a bit larger and probably more of a full scale city-state.  We don't really get a good sense of the scope of Mirkwood."
tolkienfans,3b2exb,amaranth1977,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:04:29 2015 UTC,"My impression is that noldor(rivendell) were proud, noble, high elves, the royalty of elvenkind. They've lived under the light of the two trees and are visitors in middle earth, more powerful and even haughty than native elves. Although this superiority complex might have mellowed quite a bit by the third age after being humbled by many events. The sindar(lindon, galadriel, thranduil, legolas) on the other hand feel a very strong connection to nature and middle earth, they are more of the magical, enchanted elves. They would delight more in songs of beauty and wandering woods and streams whereas noldor would take more to building impressive works and grand tales of glory. Then there's silvan(lorien, mirkwood), which are basically backwoods shut-ins. They are woodsmen, distrustful of outsiders, more wiley and dangerous. Leaving middle earth was most tragic I think for the sindar, who have never known anywhere else as home, but more of a homecoming for the noldor. I'm not even sure if all the silvan elves left, some might still be lurking about, unseen in the deepest woods"

Putting on my Dragon-helm of Dor-Conspiracy, I should think Saurond would add a line about fairness just like that to the tale.  As for the original Elrond, well, Sauron got a finger cut off and his ring taken by Isildur in the curiously vague final battle on the slopes of Orodruin. Elrond, wise and full of foresight, apparently decided to respect Isildur's wishes by letting him keep the world's most dangerous and corruption-causing treasure because weregild, eh, not like the humans are corruptible or anything; or maybe Sauron, instead of fleeing as a shadow, found the real Elrond dead in the battlefield, tossed his body into the fires, took his shape, and then, weakened by the battle but still full of wisdom, gave Isildur one set of advice when nobody else was there to hear (""keep the ring, o king, and come visit me sometime""), and told a different story when Isildur was dead (""I tried to warn, but humans are dumb; oh woe, a new age comes, you guys head over the sea while I keep an eye on things here."")  I haven't seen the theory, but it's certainly an entertaining idea.  I'm pretty sure I could think up evil reasons for Saurond to marry Galadriel's daughter, who then was lost to orcs in the Misty Mountains.  And the wars against Angmar --- might one ask if the elves faced more loss of life in those than they should have, and would have suspected spies if that wasn't unthinkable, until nothing was left but desolation and the House of Elrond?  And in the very end, a ring is destroyed, and there is a light show from Barad-Dur, a never-seen shadow is seen no more, there is a scattering of disposable orcish armies; and then the elves feel that, like Elrond has said, the age of elves is over and they should depart --- and if nobody returns from the Blessed Lands nobody really knows if any ship gets there, instead of being waylaid by pirates of Umbar. (Sure, Gandalf could climb a mast and try to fling burning pinecones, but those are no match for catapults!) And then it's just Aragorn versus the new threat rising slowly in the south --- but before it comes, the Red Book is written, and after, there will be no Hobbits to rewrite it."
tolkienfans,3b1zwb,penguin_starborn,5,Thu Jun 25 13:50:02 2015 UTC,"I actually came to mention the whole conceit of the books being written by Elves, Men and Hobbits and translated by Tolkien (Only The Hobbit and LotR were written by Bilbo and Frodo). I like that in this case, we have to conclude that Sauron's plan was so air-tight that it even fooled Professor Tolkien himself. Tolkien clearly thought Sauron was in Mordor during the War of the Ring. More than that he mentions that he spent a good deal of time and energy reincarnating himself. Obviously he was unaware that Sauron simply popped into existence as Elrond and the rest was simply a ploy."

tolkienfans,3b1zwb,Panda_Annie,15,Fri Jun 26 20:52:58 2015 UTC,"A better theory would be ""Radagast is Sauron.""  What do we know about Radagast?  A Maia - but so is Sauron.  Lived in Rosgobel (near Mirkwood) - convenient, as Sauron was known to secretly gather power in Dol Guldur in Mirkwood.  Tricks Gandalf into a trap at Orthanc. An accident? Yeah, right.  After the War breaks out, he is sent for was but ""was not there.""  Again, another convenient disappearance.  After the ring is destroyed, he is NEVER mentioned by the book again. Weird, ha? Why would not Tolkien tie up this ""loose end"" and explain what happened to a pretty major character (an Istari!), given Tolkien's obsession with describing the ultimate fate of pretty much every other character no matter how minor.  The answer is simple: after the Ring is gone, ""Radagast"" is dead."
tolkienfans,3b1zwb,Hq3473,8,Thu Jun 25 13:51:00 2015 UTC,Silly. Elrond's ancestry was well known to the wise. There WAS an (almost equally silly) theory that Tom Bombadil was Melkor though. Maybe that is what OP was referring to ?

tolkienfans,3b1zwb,jstock23,2,Thu Jun 25 14:57:07 2015 UTC,"You are absolutely right.  Both seem at first decrepit, bent little creatures, but both are much older than you'd think, and possess much more power than you'd think. (Both have a ring of power, even, though Gandalf also has his innate powers.) Both are absolutely necessary for Frodo's success, and the commentary on their actions and natures is the most memorable part of the philosophy of the book.   Both are misled by Bilbo's ring-deceptions, and impressed by Frodo's actions. (Both manhandle Sam, and also wring comedic bits, eaves and taters, from him.)  Gollum is caught and tortured by Sauron, an ancient evil beyond his anticipation, and what Gollum tells puts Frodo in great peril, lessened by Aragorn's capture of Gollum, and delivery to Mirkwood elves; shortly afterwards the peace of the Shire is broken and Gandalf comes for Frodo.  Gandalf is killed by the Balrog, an ancient evil beyond his anticipation, putting Frodo in peril until Aragorn takes charge and delivers the Company to the elves of Lothlorien; shortly afterwards the Company is broken and Gollum joins Frodo.  Both struggle with their identity and are ""reborn"" trying to protect Frodo in stony surroundings (Emyn Muil and Moria --- elf rope burns Gollum, and the Balrog burns Gandalf), both struggle with their purpose, and help Frodo in the end by providing a distraction allowing him to finish his mission. Gollum falls to his death happy, though not good, freeing Frodo; Gandalf is ready to face death at Morannon and take the armies of the West with him, just to give Frodo a chance.  Both pass away from the world without a trace. Finally, and most importantly, Gandalf is a servant of the secret fire, wielder of the flame of Anor, provider of fireworks; Gollum falls into a volcano which then explodes."

I remember one chapter in particular followed a storyline about Turin and Beleg Strongbow narrowly escaping death when Mim the dwarf betrayed them to Orcs. You leave thinking ""thank god they both survived"". The next chapter is called ""The death of Beleg.""   What the hell Chris?"
tolkienfans,3b04eg,mattydababy,27,Wed Jun 24 23:54:17 2015 UTC,The chapter titles in Sil and Children seem more like doctrine or are worded in a sort of biblical style. just my opinion tho
tolkienfans,3b04eg,Elliot850,17,Thu Jun 25 00:56:43 2015 UTC,Yeah there's definitely a strong air of that. It's not written like a narrative but rather detailing a history that the reader has already been made aware of.   I think that's partially what makes Sil especially so hard to read the first time. It makes references to storylines not yet covered.
tolkienfans,3b04eg,mattydababy,3,Thu Jun 25 01:01:10 2015 UTC,"people have said this before on this sub, but a mini series ala Cosmos would be a great way to depict the Silmarillion."

tolkienfans,3b0lz4,SSTTDID,8,Thu Jun 25 00:33:11 2015 UTC,"No, no special term for the lineage, and they were known simply as the First, Second, Third and Fourth White Tree of Gondor. Also, it's Silmarils.   Because I can, here's the history..  Yavanna sang into existence the Two Trees, silver Telperion and golden Laurelin shedding light comparable to moon and sun. Telperion was referred to as male and Laurelin female. The Trees sat on the hill Ezellohar located outside Valimar. They grew in the presence of all of the Valar, watered by the tears of Nienna. Because the Elves that first came to Valinor especially loved Telperion, Yavanna made a second tree like it to stand in the city of Tirion where the Vanyar and Noldor dwelt together at first. This tree, named Galathilion, was identical to Telperion except that it gave no light of its own being. It had many seedlings, one of which was named Celeborn, and planted on the isle of Tol Eressëa.  In the Second Age, a seedling of Celeborn was brought as a gift to the Númenóreans, that was known as Nimloth, the White Tree of Númenor. It lasted through the vast majority of the realm's duration, but when Sauron took control of the island he had king Ar-Pharazôn chop it down.  The first White Tree of Gondor came from a fruit that Isildur, at great personal risk, managed to steal from Nimloth the Fair, the White Tree of Númenor, before it was destroyed at Sauron's insistence. He suffered many wounds at this mission, and he came near death, but when the first leaf opened in the spring, Isildur was healed of his wounds.  This sapling was brought to Middle-earth on Isildur's ship, and it was eventually planted in Minas Ithil before the house of Isildur. But when Sauron returned to Middle-earth, he launched a sudden attack that captured Minas Ithil, and he destroyed the White Tree.  Isildur escaped the capture of Minas Ithil, taking with him a sapling of the White Tree to Minas Anor where it was planted in the citadel courtyard in memory of his slain brother Anárion. This tree died in 1636 during the Great Plague.  A third sapling was planted in the year 1640 of the Third Age by King Tarondor. This one lasted until the year 2872 and the death of the Ruling Steward Belecthor II.  At this time no seedling of the tree could be found as the tree had rarely flowered after the line of the Kings had failed and therefore no fruit was produced. It was left standing after its death ""until the King returns"".  When Aragorn became king he discovered (with Gandalf's help) a sapling of the White Tree upon the slopes of Mindolluin, high above the city, which he reverently planted in the Court of the Fountain. The dead tree was removed from the court but was placed in the Tombs of the Kings with all the honour that would normally be accorded a fallen monarch. In June of the year 3019 of the Third Age the sapling was already laden with blossom."

tolkienfans,3azilz,fileg,4,Thu Jun 25 12:28:27 2015 UTC,"For me, Tolkien is best read during the winter.  Maybe it's because I read the series for the first time in the winter when I was 11 or so (I remember meeting Strider for the first time right before going to my Grandparents' house for Thanksgiving dinner).  I also wound up reading the Silmarillion and Unfinished Tales in the winter (I read Ainulindale and the next few chapters in the mountains as it was snowing outside).  I'm sure that the movies being released at Christmas helped to reinforce this.  So now whenever I read LotR, it's generally cold, overcast/rainy, and I have a mug of good dark beer or a glass of homebrewed mead.  Edit: Clarity"
tolkienfans,3azilz,GrimnirOdinson,3,Fri Jun 26 01:49:41 2015 UTC,"I've been reading lotr once every couple years since i was a teenager in the 90's. I was also a big pothead in highschool, and one time I thought ""it would be so cool to read the whole book high."" I smoked every time I sat down with the book, and I would get through paragraphs and realize I had to reread them because I had no idea what I just read. Wouldn't recommend. But really, I remember trying to read the silmarillion several times and just not getting into it. It felt like trying to read the bible. Once I finally read the appendices, unfinished tales, silmarillion, etc it added so much to these books, it's amazing. I don't like to constantly stop reading to look up names or check a map. Once I start, I'm immersed, and i might go check out the backstories and maps later on when I'm not reading. And it feels more real that way, being familiar with the history of arda, the elves and middle earth to the point of just knowing the references like the characters do."

Today with phones and stuff people don't notice the passing of time or don't remember it, because they don't have to. Before people had writing they preserved their traditions by retelling them.

If you know the date, you can use the sun or stars to figure out your latitude (North/South position). The moon can be useful for tracking the passage of time, but you can't just glance at it and know what time it is unless you've been keeping notes or have a detailed almanac for your location.  Also, ships used time pieces to track time. A half-hour glass was a common tool. You'd ring a bell every time you flipped the glass."

You use the sun to determine the time at your current location.  If you also know the current time at a fixed location (e.g. the port you left from) you can use the difference to determine your longitude.  The tricky part historically was coming up with a clock that would accurately keep time for days or weeks under sailing conditions, and thus allow you to keep your reference time accurately."

Either way you are comparing local noon/sunrise/sunset (or some intermediate angle of the sun vs the horizon) to the noon/sunrise/sunset at another location of which you know the time.  If you don't know the time (Greenwich or some other fixed location), you can't figure out longitude."

For it may be deadly: lies of the Enemy that out of envy will breed hate. Not all the voices that come out of the darkness speak truth to those minds that listen for strange news.  'But who did you this hurt? Who imposed death upon you? Melkor, it is plain that you would say, or whatever name you have for him in secret. For you speak of death and his shadow, as if these were one and the same; and as if to escape from the Shadow was to escape also from Death.  'But these two are not the same, Andreth. So I deem, or death would not be found at all in this world which he did not design but Another. Nay, death is but the name that we give to something that he has tainted, and it sounds therefore evil; but untainted its name would be good.'   I would side with Finrod here. Also let's remember that Men were very young when Melkor went among them. It is possible that they didn't have a correct idea of their gift and thus thought that death was caused by Melkor himself. ( They thought correlation is the same as causation) . Overall I think it would not be possible for Melkor to change the very fate of Eru's children.   Edit: And also,   'I say so, indeed,' answered Finrod. 'The Shadow may have darkened your unrest, bringing swifter weariness and soon turning it to disdain, but the unrest was ever there, I believe."

Elves have to live with every error the make for eternity. How does Feanor feel about his oath ages later?

The idea is basically taken entire from Christian theology, so you could probably actually look at the bible for some perspective on it, and that perspective would arguably be valid in-world (there may be some differences as well, of course. Tolkien isn't overly free with his descriptions of the ultimate fate of Men). But yes, basically I'd say you're right. They leave Ea for somewhere more perfect, free of any taint.

It's purely speculation, but perhaps a portion of that place takes a form based on Arda; why shouldn't it, if Men are supposed to be happy? They wouldn't have anything to miss, then.

It's debilitating, actually, to provide such a stark contrast on who should be here. Where do our ranks come from, if not the casual fans? The attrition of time will damn us all if .  For that reason, we're much more concerned with what should be here. That way, the who that make up the who you have a problem with (a much smaller portion of the who you name), don't bring their what here (and it's that specific brand of what at the core of your distaste, I think), and the subreddit can remain what it is meant to be: not a place for the top tier of fans, not a place for only those willing to go to the deepest depths, but a place for serious and sincere discussion, however grand or small."

They're given the choice whether to be counted as men (become mortal and die eventually) or elves (immortal, can go to Valinor). Tolkien never wrote which fate they ultimately chose. Even if we did, they do not magically become an elf or man depending upon their choice. They would remain Half-Elven.   As a side note, Elrond did indeed choose to be counted as an elf and thus is several thousand years old by this time. His daughter, however, chose to be counted among men and eventually passed away."
tolkienfans,3aeyvc,EyeceEyeceBaby,3,Fri Jun 19 16:28:07 2015 UTC,"But I thought half elven, within tolkien's world, means that you chose either elven or man.

tolkienfans,3aeyvc,italia06823834,6,Fri Jun 19 16:45:17 2015 UTC,"That choice only ultimately effects their fate. Having that choice, and perhaps having not made it yet, opens them up to that fear of death and the ghosts of Men.  At least that's my speculation. I do think it is an interesting topic."

tolkienfans,3aeyvc,EyeceEyeceBaby,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:13:30 2015 UTC,"I see. I guess I always thought that the choice of mortal/immortal was made at birth. Not sure where I got the idea from, but It's how it worked in my head."
tolkienfans,3aeyvc,PrivateChicken,4,Fri Jun 19 17:03:55 2015 UTC,"In addition to my reply below, I think this explains some of the confusion with thinking about Half-Elven. The choice doesn't have to be made at birth. The Valar didn't give Elrond and Elros the choice until after the War of Wrath, at which point they were full-grown."
tolkienfans,3aeyvc,ReinierPersoon,5,Fri Jun 19 17:17:59 2015 UTC,"IIRC, most if not all those given the choice that choose the gift of men, conveniently make their choice after the age of 50, after the point at which elves grow to their full height. Avoiding any questions of how a half elven child develops.  Dior is the only problem, as he dies in this 30's I think. Did he die before making his choice? I don't know, but it's a mighty curious situation."
tolkienfans,3aeyvc,PrivateChicken,2,Sat Jun 20 06:24:58 2015 UTC,"Perhaps they can still make the choice after death. On Arda death seems to be just the loss of your physical body, I imagine when Dior was killed his houseless spirit just stood there, and faced the choice of going to the Halls of Mandos or to leave Arda forever. It's said somewhere that houseless spirits of Elves sometimes tarry before going to Mandos."
tolkienfans,3aeyvc,Evan_Th,2,Sat Jun 20 16:20:03 2015 UTC,"He might have even made the choice at Mandos, Men still stop there briefly before departing the world entirely.  If I had to guess, Dior probably would have chosen the Elven fate, to be with his spouse."
tolkienfans,3aeyvc,EyeceEyeceBaby,2,Sat Jun 20 17:48:48 2015 UTC,"A curious situation indeed.  I would guess he was considered a Man, because he died before Eru through Manwe offered the Half-Elven their choice.  We know from one of Tolkien's unpublished writings that the half-elven children of Mithrellas and Imrazor were mortal, so it seems that being Man is the ""default"" when no specific choice is offered.  Which would be very sad, considering his wife was a full Elf."
tolkienfans,3aeyvc,ReinierPersoon,10,Sun Jun 21 16:58:59 2015 UTC,"True, I didn't mean to imply they counted as a separate race. Half-Elven who haven't chosen their fate are simply...well, Half-Elven. And when they do choose the fate of the Elves or the fate of Men they are still Half-Elven.   Perhaps it would help in understanding to think of Elves and Men as two ""races"" of humans on earth. I put ""race"" in quotation marks because it is a social construct, physiologically there isn't anything really that different between a Caucasian, an African, or an Asian. If a child is born of a Caucasian father and an African mother, what are they? Black? White? Are they a new, mixed race? Of course not. They're human just like their parents. I think we as readers commonly use the term ""race"" to define Elf or Man because it fits with our social concept of it, but are they really that different? After all they both have the same father, he merely decided to give them distinctive qualities that (much like humans seem to) they latched onto and self-identified with.  I feel like I'm wandering a little in my point here but the fact is Half-Elves don't fit with Elves entirely, and don't fit with Men entirely either. The choice is of who they wish to be counted among at the End. That doesn't change their genetic makeup magically and it also doesn't mean a being of mixed heritage is a new race either.  At least that's always been my understanding of it, admittedly this is a topic of which I can't recall any definitive canon explanation (beyond what being Half-Elven means with respect to fate)."
tolkienfans,3aeyvc,Tokkat1138,2,Fri Jun 19 17:10:59 2015 UTC,"I think, and this is speculation, that Men are afraid of the ghosts because they have a fear of death, originally caused by Melkor's lies, because death was meant as the Gift of Men so they could leave Arda, while the Elves were bound to it.  Aragorn is also has distant Elf (and Maia) ancestors, but it says only Legolas had no fear, implying that Aragorn does. Not sure how it would affect Elladan and Elrohir."

The term Half-Elven simply refers to anyone of mixed ancestry who has the choice to be counted as a man or an elf. The descendants of Elrond's twin brother, Elros (including Aragorn) would also genetically be some fraction Elvish but wouldn't be given the choice to decide their fate. They were granted long life but were all counted as men after Elros."
tolkienfans,3aeyvc,EyeceEyeceBaby,5,Sun Jun 21 01:09:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's what I always assumed ""half-elven"" meant. The only actually half-elf/half-man people were Dior and Earendil, right? Because, like you said, even Elrond and Elros were technically 9/16 elf, because they were descended from both Dior and Earendil.  EDIT: And on a side note, I just realized that Arwen being half-elven is why she was able to choose a mortal life instead of going to the Undying Lands. I never picked up on that when reading before, and I now feel kind of dumb for not realizing that."
tolkienfans,3aeyvc,Tokkat1138,3,Sun Jun 21 01:20:12 2015 UTC,"Strictly speaking Dior was half human, quarter elf and quarter maia. Earendil was the only true half elf if memory serves."

tolkienfans,3abc6r,Soarel2,29,Sat Jun 20 20:46:50 2015 UTC,"Even if nobody realized that the Istari were Maiar I don't think it would be very strange for even the wisest elves to treat them with reverence and respect their counsel. For example, we can be fairly certain nobody knew who or what Tom Bombadil was and yet at the Council of Elrond the idea of giving him the ring for safe keeping is treated seriously. I think even if the details of their origin was unknown it would nonetheless be clear to the elves that the istari are no ordinary men, and are indeed quite powerful.   Also, I'm pretty Cirdan and Galadriel knew, at least. Cirdan, after all, saw them come in from the west, and I believe at some point in the Unfinished Tales Galadriel refers to Gandalf as Olorin, suggesting she knew he was a Maia."
tolkienfans,3abc6r,istari97,22,Thu Jun 18 23:14:42 2015 UTC,"Just from the respect shown to Gandalf by people like Elrond, Galadriel and Círdan, and their willingness to listen to him, people would figure out he is a respectable person. Gandalf was also quite famous, everyone knows him, even if by different names. He has done 2000 years of traveling in Middle-earth, so not a big surprise.  Since Gandalf means wand-elf, the common people in the north may have figured that since he is not a Man and not a Dwarf, he must be an Elf."
tolkienfans,3abc6r,ReinierPersoon,3,Fri Jun 19 00:25:24 2015 UTC,"I think they assumed he was an Elf due to the strong associations between elves and ""magic"" in the 3rd Age (though the Elves, specifically the Noldor, were loath to call it that).

tolkienfans,3abc6r,ReinierPersoon,9,Fri Jun 19 02:45:13 2015 UTC,"The only two cases I can think of where anyone would question Gandalf's past come from Return of the king.  The first is Denethor, who Gandalf provides some insight (though he likely knew this himself without Gandalf telling him, as he knows a great many things and can read the minds and hearts of others).   But all worthy things that are in peril as the world now stands, those are my care. And for my part, I shall not wholly fail of my task, though Gondor should perish, if anything passes through this night that can still grow fair or bear fruit and flower again in days to come. For I also am a steward. Did you not know?' And with that he turned and strode from the hall with Pippin running at his side. - Gandalf   Denethor was a very learned lore master, and I believe he must have known that Gandalf was something special. I cant say he knew Gandalf was a Maia, but he had to have been aware that he was not just a man.  The second is Pippin:   Denethor looked indeed much more like a great wizard than Gandalf did, more kingly, beautiful, and powerful; and older. Yet by a sense other than sight Pippin perceived that Gandalf had the greater power and the deeper wisdom, and a majesty that was veiled. And he was older, far older. 'How much older?' he wondered, and then he thought how odd it was that he had never thought about it before. Treebeard had said something about wizards, but even then he had not thought of Gandalf as one of them. What was Gandalf? In what far time and place did he come into the world, and when would he leave it?    Pip clearly knows something is up, but lacks the lore to make a conclusion. If Pippin can connect these dots, it leads me to believe Denethor has to know something of substance."
tolkienfans,3abc6r,DividingPrescott,3,Fri Jun 19 12:54:31 2015 UTC,"Treebeard had said something about wizards   What about Ents?  Surely they lived long enough to connect the dots?  Or do they simply not find it off for wizard to live so long.  Treebeard does call Saruman ""young."""
tolkienfans,3abc6r,Hq3473,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:13:53 2015 UTC,"Treebeard isn't right here. Saruman is young only in the sense that his coming to Middle-earth in the shape of an old man is 2000 years ago, which would not be a long time for Treebeard, but he has been around since before the creation of Arda, so he is far older than Treebeard. Since the Ents and Eagles were set to appear when the first Elves awoke, we can guess Treebeard is roughly the same age as Círdan, so aside from him and maybe a bunch of other Elves everyone is young to him.  Treebeard also calls himself the first, which is only true if he means the first Ent, because there were the Ainur and likely Bombadil before him.  Treebeard certainly isn't all-knowing, he doesn't know of Hobbits either. He recites that verse in the books of the living things, Hobbits, Elves etc, and I don't think it mentions Maiar, so I'm not sure the Ents are truly aware of the Ainur. They probably would connect the dots and know that Gandalf was not some human."

tolkienfans,3abc6r,mutually_awkward,16,Sat Jun 20 23:18:42 2015 UTC,"Maybe I am wrong on this, but I would think that because of the  hobbits' lack of ""real world"" experience, they wouldn't think elves deferring to a ""wizard"" was anything out of place. I'm struggling to find a real world example of this though. Maybe this: If the president of the United States took you on an adventure, and you were unaware of anything about him other than he seemed to know all about places like far away Russia and China, would you really find it odd that the Queen and Prime Minister of England heeded his advice?"
tolkienfans,3abc6r,bmiller5758,7,Thu Jun 18 19:24:01 2015 UTC,"The hobbits also only really knew of him as a ""great"" wizard or anything. They ""mistook him for some conjurer of cheap tricks"" in a manner of speaking. They kind of deferred to him just out of the fact that he seemed a wise-enough and respectable enough fellow, and didn't take kindly to his meddling when it eventually came about anyway. For everyone else, however (such as elves, men, and dwarves) whenever someone that was a lordly looking person deferred to Gandalf, of course they did in kind. This is all my personal musings of it though, and could be wrong myself."

tolkienfans,3aacjj,ChillBro69,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:36:15 2015 UTC,"I've always noticed how the Prologue references Gollum's birthday present from the first edition of The Hobbit. I assumed Tolkien put that in because he hadn't yet changed The Hobbit when he wrote the Prologue, or had changed it at about the same time. Even after he changed it there were plenty of originals around, so the Prologue mentions the ""error"" in the original version, but also ""many copies contain the true account"".  This blog post suggests Tolkien was making fun of the fact he had changed The Hobbit, but I always thought it was more like he was covering his bases. It must have been many many years before pre-change original Hobbits became rare."
tolkienfans,3a64jy,Canadian_Bassist,14,Wed Jun 17 15:05:13 2015 UTC,"Have you read the Lord of the Rings? You should read that first, don't worry about all the other stories yet. Keep in mind that the Lord of the Rings was written for people who had no idea what all the names and places referred to in passing were, since only the Hobbit had been published by then. You're not supposed to know exactly what all these references are, in fact they contribute to the sense of wonder and mystery and I think going on a wiki rampage before reading LOTR would spoil the effect a little. You'll learn what lies behind each one by the time you get around to reading the Silmarillion and all the rest, which should prove easy after you've finished the Lord fo the Rings."
tolkienfans,3a64jy,Kookanoodles,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:26:52 2015 UTC,Trying to read Lord off the Rings the first time was actually what got me to pose this question. It was probably a case of to much to fast. I got about to the point where they reach Tom Bombadil and release I was confused as to who half the people that they had mentioned where. Maybe ill try it again and take it slower this time and take time to digest it.
tolkienfans,3a64jy,HannasAnarion,3,Thu Jun 18 00:30:08 2015 UTC,"For a first read, taking it slower will just make it harder. After Bombadil, the story picks up a lot. If you like it well enough, you can dig through all the little details on your second read through in a year or two. All those people that have been mentioned, aren't going to be whatsoever important down the line. They aren't part of the story, they are part of the setting. Tolkien is all about the world that the story is set in. Gildor, the elf that the group meets in Chapter 3? Never mentioned again. But it tells you about the world that the book is set in, and what to expect from elves that appear later.   You'll know the ones that are important. There's a reason that PJ spent all of two minutes on book I chapters 3-8 in making the films. If you've gotten through Bombadil, then you're on chapter 9, where it starts to really get good."
tolkienfans,3a64jy,ReinierPersoon,2,Thu Jun 18 06:24:17 2015 UTC,"As HannasAnarion says, things pick up after Bombadil. There are also things and names in the books that you won't understand the first time you read it, because you were not meant to understand. There is a lot of foreshadowing in the first part of the book that you will not understand unless you know what is going to happen.  Remember that in the beginning of the book some Hobbits are drinking and gossipping? Sam's cousin claims to have seen a walking tree! The other Hobbits dismiss it, but later in the books we learn more about it. It is something you spot on a second reading.  Tom Bombadil has some foreshadowing and some history lessons from Tom, it's fine if you don't understand it all yet. As for names, many people show up only for very sort bits and are often not important.  There are also many smaller stories within the story, such as Aragorn telling the tale of Lúthien, or Elves babbling about Valimar. This stuff makes more sense when you read it after having read the Silmarillion, which is much worse concerning names, but it has a glossary of names at the end.   Then there is the thing with people having multiple names, such as Gandalf or Strider.  Another thing are chapters like the Council of Elrond, where they basically explain what is happening. There is also some name-dropping in it by Elrond, but some if it is just exposition, such as him saying he was at Thangorodrim, which is just to establish he is an old dude. Thangorodrim is gone anyway and I don't think it comes up anywhere else."
tolkienfans,3a64jy,ajdjjd,0,Thu Jun 18 22:41:44 2015 UTC,"Book 1 (of the six, i.e., the first half of FotR) is really the toughest part, and Tom Bombadil is about the halfway mark of that book.  I have always told people, muscle through to the Mines of Moria.  After that, it is a wild joyride to the end."
tolkienfans,3a64jy,Billy_Fish,7,Thu Jun 18 05:23:58 2015 UTC,I think it comes from multiple readings of the book(s). Here are some good books that can be of assistance:  The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion by Wayne Hammond and Christina Scull  The Complete Guide to Middle Earth by Robert Foster  The Atlas of Middle Earth by Karen Wynn Fonstad  The Complete Tolkien Companion by J.E.A. Tyler  Steer clear of all of David Day's stuff.
tolkienfans,3a64jy,Steuard,3,Wed Jun 17 15:21:32 2015 UTC,"Tyler's book is also probably best avoided. The newer editions have gotten better, but I have very little confidence in his work.  Foster's book is probably the best book on this list for what the OP is looking for: it's basically an encyclopedia of names and topics. (Mind you, it'll probably have ""spoilers"" all over. But maybe that's a moot point after the movies, even for folks reading for the first time.) Hammond and Scull's book is great, but I see it more as ""if you want more depth"" than ""I want help following what's going on"".  Fonstad's Atlas is also very nice. (There's a neat little map book called The Journeys of Frodo, too, that can be fun to follow along with while reading. It may be out of print.)"

It's a great big family tree, every character in the world. Especially useful when you get to the Silmarillion, which isn't so much a story as it is a history, and it's written in an almost biblical style, with more people and more things happening than you can possibly keep track of.   Seriously, though, you don't need to keep it all in your head to understand it. In Book 1 of the Lord of the Rings especially, there are so many names of Hobbits and such that are dropped and then never bothered with again. For a first read, you can just kind of skim over most of them, unless it's a character who is actually speaking with the perspective characters(Frodo, Sam, Merry, Pippin) in more than one scene."

None of them are necessary to understand the story as it is presented (remember when it was first published new readers didn't know any of it either!). There should be  a map in your copy of LotR to help with the places some though.  There are resources you can find though. Atlas of Middle-Earth by Fonstad and A Reader's Companion by Hammond and Scull are very good books, though they may have more info in them than you want.  Foster's A Complete Guide to Middle-earth is also pretty good.    I'd stay away from anything with David Day as the author though (he tends to make stuff up).

tolkienfans,3a6pyv,mmottola12,2,Wed Jun 17 17:39:18 2015 UTC,"I have not done this, so take my opinion with a grain of salt regarding whether it's worth doing in your opinion.  My instinct is that one is better served by keeping a timeline open (say, Appendix B of LotR) if you are at all concerned with keeping the strict order of events in mind. The narrative is written as just that, a story and I can't imagine that it would be improved by jumping around out of the order that the author intended.  That being said, I can see how this might be less of an issue with parts of the Silmarillion as some parts of it are told in broad strokes rather than specific stories and you could also probably move stuff from Appendix A to their ""correct"" points in a reread (say, putting the ""Tale of Arwen and Aragorn"" between The Hobbit and LotR). I guess my main point is that I don't think that interleaving the events of Frodo and Sam with the rest of the fellowship would be especially enlightening, but maybe move any ""external"" sources touching on events in LotR to before LotR in the reading order (like the Hunt for the Ring in UT which technically occurs after the first chapter and coinciding with the rest of Book 1)."
tolkienfans,3a6pyv,WalkingTarget,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:32:05 2015 UTC,"I don't see how it would make for very good reading to do that.  The two books of RoTK for example are happening concurrently, so it kind of ruins the end of the first part, storytelling-wise, by jumping back and forth between one and the other.  Attempting to do so for tCoH with its part in the Sil and UT would likely be a painful experience as well; one is a condensed version as part of a larger story, one is a partially more fleshed-out version which may not even entirely agree with that one, and the third is kind of a revised ""finished"" edit that attempts to complete the second.  All of them read just fine on their own but trying to go strictly chronologically between the three might be kind of ugly. That said, it is kind of interesting to study the chronology for the sake of ""oh hey, A is at the same time as B, that's kind of neat, it is why C could/couldn't have happened"". There is also the aspect of a lack of consistency, since the only truly finished stories are the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings, and everything else was kind of part of a constant evolution of ideas of what ""should be"".  For example, the Galadriel/Celeborn stuff in LoTR, Sil, and UT, don't all agree with each other.  If he had lived longer, maybe we would have gotten a finished ""canon"" for everything, but we don't have that."

tolkienfans,3a6pyv,ReinierPersoon,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:51:41 2015 UTC,"Well, I think in LotR she says something about ""passing the test"" when she refuses the Ring, and that because of it she can ""go into the West."" (Not exact quotes). Implying that she was covered by the initial Ban of the Valar and not pardoned after Morgoth got stomped.  Other versions of her story include her leaving Valinor before the Ban was even imposed, or staying in Middle Earth for the Second and Third ages because she rejected the pardon, so those versions would contradict one another."
tolkienfans,3a6pyv,Glitterbritches,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:59:53 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure that is actually implied. What I think it means: if she took the Ring from Frodo and used it for evil, she would no longer be allowed back. I think she was included in the pardon already, but chose to stay in Middle-earth. I think her comment of ""passing to the West"" meant that if the Ring would be destroyed, the Elves would leave since their Rings no longer work, and their time in ME is truly over.  Those other versions you mentioned are clearly different, but I think  that Silm and LotR don't contradict each other."

I worked out the chronology myself (I was without internet at the time, which forced me to not be lazy) by referencing Appendix B and in-text notes, and then I read each section on the corresponding calendar day. This was at least my tenth read through, but I lost track of the exact count some time ago.  My experience was that working out the chronology was very helpful and shed light on Tolkien's skill in weaving story. However, when I moved on to actually reading it in order (and on the corresponding calendar days, more or less), it was kind of boring. I gained a better appreciation for how long the hobbits spend sitting around partying (Rivendell, Lothlorien), but the the impact of the narration was greatly lessened—it became clear that Tolkien's layering of the story threads really is part of the story itself.  In the end, I'm not planning to read it that way again, although I think it's a useful thing to do once. I wouldn't recommend that anyone do so before having read through LotR in published order at least 3 times, though."

The division of it into three volumes was an editorial decision, not a creative one. Wikipedia cites the reason as being due to WWII paper shortages, but regardless of the reason Tolkien's intent was that the three volumes be a single book and to be read as such.  If you're questioning how to proceed because you have some knowledge from The Silmarillion, then don't worry about it. Just proceed through Volumes I-III (Books I-VI) in sequential order.

My headcanon explanation, however, is that Glorfindel or somebody else who had been over there before (even if not by sailing over the Straight Road transition point from east to west as Frodo would have been doing) saw the manuscript and gave the go-ahead on it being a good way to describe it.

tolkienfans,39yzpp,ebneter,1 point,Tue Jun 16 04:01:51 2015 UTC,"When Sauron made the One Ring, he did so by pooring his own essence into it. Thus Sauron and the Ring were connected, and his will was made part of it. Sauron wasn't permanately disembodied after Númenor and the War of the Last Alliance because the Ring hadn't been destroyed, and he and the Ring are one. Then, at the End of the War of the Ring, the One was destroyed and Sauron was destroyed with it.   And as the captains gazed south to the land of Mordor, it seemed to them that, black against the pale cloud, there rose a huge shape of shadow, impenetrable, lightning crowned, filling all the sky. Enormous it reared above the world, and stretched out towards them a vast threatening hand, terrible but impotent, for even as it leaned over them, a great wind took it, and it was all blown away, and passed; and then a hush fell.   Enormous terrible cloud hand = Sauron  Wind blowing hand away = Valar rejecting his return"
tolkienfans,39yzpp,Squirrel_Boy_1,8,Tue Jun 16 05:38:41 2015 UTC,"First, the idea that Sauron was only ever able to return to life because of the Ring is provably false, as Tolkien notes in the Osanwe-kenta that Sauron's body was destroyed for the first time in the First Age. That's before he made the Ring.  Second, /u/PersonUsingAComputer specifically used the example of Sauron's death in the Drowning of Numenor. This is a different death than his final death, but no one was ever talking about final deaths. After all, you can't prove that Gandalf would have never been able to retake physical form following the death of his old man body. If you want to argue that we should only pay attention to specific circumstances, it is up to you to prove that those specific circumstances apply to all the things you are considering.  Third, your quote does not indicate what you claimed. You said Sauron tried to go to the West. Perhaps you were confusing this with Saruman's death-shade, because Sauron's there, through the words of your quote, is menacing and is looming north."
tolkienfans,39yzpp,Uluithiad,1 point,Tue Jun 16 05:57:57 2015 UTC,"you can't prove that Gandalf would have never been able to retake physical form following the death of his old man body.   Isn't Saruman evidence for this? After he died, Saruman never formed a new body, and he was more powerful than Gandalf the Grey. It's possible that he just didn't try to make a new body, but we can assume this isn't true since evidence suggests Saruman isn't the kind of guy to just give up.   Sauron's there, through the words of your quote, is menacing and is looming north.   You have a point about the cloud hand looming north, though one could argue that ""stretching toward"" doesn't necessarily mean ""facing"", but that's beside the point. This still seems way too similar to Saruman's death-shade to just be coincidence. In both of these instances:   A maia is destroyed A cloudy mist rises from their body A wind blows the cloud away   It's clear when Saruman dies that his ""cloud"" tried to return to Valinor, and it's clear that the wind was the Valar denying his return. There's a chance that Sauron might not have wanted to return to Valinor, but the similarity to Saruman suggests that he did."
tolkienfans,39yzpp,Squirrel_Boy_1,4,Tue Jun 16 06:18:31 2015 UTC,"While it's true that Sauron put a great deal of power into the Ring, and that he was not permanently disembodied nor weakened to impotence while it existed, that's still a far cry from saying ""his 'body' wasn't really destroyed."" His body most certainly was really destroyed, and he lacked any physical form for awhile. A relatively short while, in this instance, but nevertheless.  /u/Uluithiad has very thoroughly dealt with the second point."

When elves die, they're spirits go to Valinor, where they wait until the end of the world. A similar thing happens to maiar like Gandalf. When they die, they're spirits can return to Valinor if the Valar allow them. Evil maiar, like Sauron and Saruman, are not premitted to return. This is why Gandalf's poem about death is derived from Tolkien's description of Valinor. After he died, Gandalf's spirit returned to Valinor, and was later sent back to Middle-earth by Eru."

tolkienfans,39yzpp,PersonUsingAComputer,4,Tue Jun 16 15:25:56 2015 UTC,"Tolkien says in his letters that:   That I should say is what the Authority wished, as a set-off to Saruman. The 'wizards', as such, had failed; or if you like: the crisis had become too grave and needed an enhancement of power. So Gandalf sacrificed himself, was accepted, and enhanced, and returned. 'Yes, that was the name. I was Gandalf.' Of course he remains similar in personality and idiosyncrasy, but both his wisdom and power are much greater. When he speaks he commands attention; the old Gandalf could not have dealt so with Théoden, nor with Saruman. He is still under the obligation of concealing his power and of teaching rather than forcing or dominating wills, but where the physical powers of the Enemy are too great for the good will of the opposers to be effective he can act in emergency as an 'angel' – no more violently than the release of St Peter from prison. He seldom does so, operating rather through others, but in one or two cases in the War (in Vol. III) he does reveal a sudden power: he twice rescues Faramir. He alone is left to forbid the entrance of the Lord of Nazgûl to Minas Tirith, when the City has been overthrown and its Gates destroyed — and yet so powerful is the whole train of human resistance, that he himself has kindled and organized, that in fact no battle between the two occurs: it passes to other mortal hands. In the end before he departs for ever he sums himself up: 'I was the enemy of Sauron'. He might have added: 'for that purpose I was sent to Middle-earth'. But by that he would at the end have meant more than at the beginning. He was sent by a mere prudent plan of the angelic Valar or governors; but Authority had taken up this plan and enlarged it, at the moment of its failure. 'Naked I was sent back – for a brief time, until my task is done'. Sent back by whom, and whence? Not by the 'gods' whose business is only with this embodied world and its time; for he passed 'out of thought and time'.   While it doesn't literally say ""Eru"", there's not really anyone else ranked above the Valar, who exists outside the material world, and who gets Capital Letters even when referred to indirectly as ""Authority""."

I think this is what happened to Beren, but I'm not to sure it's been a while since I've read the Sil. So if this were true, I guess Gandalf's words would make some sense given that a hobbits ultimate fate would be the same as man's and that both would journey to valinor, over past the green country, and to the halls of mandos to spend some time there."
tolkienfans,39yzpp,Hoppetar,1 point,Tue Jun 16 04:39:21 2015 UTC,"Everyone in LotR is ""immortal"" in the sense Gandalf would been immortal under his own power. While their afterlives may not be identical, no soul is ultimately destroyed upon death.  When Maiar, and even Valar, take a physical form and then die, they lose their physical form and pass out of the world, unable to take shape again (unless tied to the world like Sauron was through the ring).   At some point, it was said that Morgoth was the only entity capable of taking shape again after destruction, but I don't know where (and IF at all) that was said and can't give you a quote on it.  In either case, it seems pretty well-founded that neither Maiar nor Valar would be able to re-materialize if they were ever destroyed within the confines of the physical world, even if Morgoth may have been an exception to this rule.   Gandalf's physical (rather than spiritual) immortality (after the fight with the Balrog) was not owing to his inherent nature, rather due to the intercession of some higher power (Manwë is usually implicated here) who restored his physical existence. Otherwise, he too would have passed out of the world, like any ordinary ""mortal"", and continued existence in the ""outside"" (there is a small uncertainty on my part whether the death of Maia or Vala would mean a return to Valinor, or to the outside that all Maiar and Valar originally existed in and entered the world from - I tend towards the latter). Even if there is reasonable uncertainty about what exactly Tolkien intended as a consistent post-mortem existence for Maiar and Valar, that does not lessen what he has stated about the fate of men and elves with certainty:   As for men (and Hobbits count as such), death was known as the ""Gift of Men"" by the elves, for while elves, even in death, were bound to the confines of the material (elves who die are reincarnated or rematerialized - not sure which - in Valinor), the souls of men would upon death leave the world entirely (and here we see a clearly Christian theme) and go unto a fate that was not even understood by the Valar at large.   It may very well be that this ultimate fate of men's souls looks different from either Valinor or the ""outside"" that the Maiar and Valar previously inhabited (which may be outer space?), however, since this ""gift"" came directly from Eru, it can be expected that their final fate is not an evil one.   As for your original question about Gandalf's encouraging words - no, Gandalf could not have known what the ultimate fate of Pippin's soul would be, anymore than anyone else knows, except for Eru himself. But that is not really a problem, because Gandalf never said so either in the book - just in the movies!"

tolkienfans,39vg6l,xXxcock_and_ballsxXx,52,Mon Jun 15 03:16:59 2015 UTC,"Sauron fully understands the one ring. Perhaps the one thing he misjudged about it was that its own corruptive power would indirectly be his undoing.  The tricky thing to get about the one ring, and part of the deeper mystery in the mythology, is that the one ring does not make someone invisible in the same sense as the invisible man or other sci-fi stories, it's not bending light rays or some other trick more easily explained with some kind of physics.  The one ring shifts a mortal wearer bodily into the spirit world, essentially. There's perhaps a subtle difference between this and bending light rays or something, in that it's a truly mythical and mystical phenomenon.  It makes more sense if one has read the Silmarillion and the History of Middle Earth series. The creation story in the Silmarillion describes how the world (Arda) was created. What's notable about this is that the physical world (the tangible world) is essentially and inherently a manifestation of a spiritual will given real form by the 'Secret Fire' the power of true creation that is held by Eru (God). So, one thing to understand about Middle Earth is that the fundamental underlying reality of the world is the intangible thoughts and wills of God and his Ainur (angels) made manifest. Bear with me, this is pertinent to an explanation of the one ring.  The Ainur who descended into the world were inherently spirit beings for whom wearing a physical form was essentially like wearing clothing for us. At least at the beginning. This is a key point because the great evil Vala Melkor (the original big bad and Sauron's boss during the First Age and before) attempted to take control of Arda by incarnating his spirit physically into all of the matter in the world, trying to make the entire world his body, basically. He failed to accomplish this anywhere close to his desire (hubris, the bane of all beings) but he did manage to taint more or less all matter in the world, to a greater or lesser degree. Gold was particularly tainted and water was probably the least tainted.  Melkor was bound into his form forever at that point, and he failed to accomplish the overwhelming victory he was imagining, but he still did have enormous power over the material world as a result. I won't go into the details in case you haven't read the Silmarillion, but eventually he was defeated and Sauron went into hiding and later took up the mantle of big bad in his own right (in the Second and Third Ages).  Sauron had no hope of attempting anything like what Melkor had done (and ultimately failed to do), so he took a different approach, though it was similar. Instead of incarnting his will into all of Arda, Sauron merely did so with the one ring.  I believe that Sauron was exploiting loop-holes in nature, essentially, provided by the presence of the Melkor-taint. I suspect that the tricks he taught the Elves to make the rings of power were essentially backdoors in nature provided by the existance of the Melkor-taint. Consider that the ringwraiths are mortal men who have permanently, and bodily!, faded into the spirit world to cheat death. Also, the chief power of the three rings (for the Elves) is essentially to hold back the effect of time upon the Elves, their places, and their works. That all seems like a backdoor cheat to me, really, and I think that this cheat is leveraging the Melkor-taint to get around the laws of nature, in effect.  So long story short, I think the rings confer 'invisiblity' to mortals because of their essential nature as backdoor exploits, linking the physical and spirit worlds in unnatural ways, and pulling a ringbearer bodily into the spirit world is just an inherent side effect of how they work. However, someone who has mastered the one ring (if that was actually possible) would presumably be able to control this effect as they willed.  So, yes, I believe that Sauron understood the effect on mortals completely, he just didn't anticipate that the very power it had to corrupt (which he was actually counting on to reveal the ring to him) would ultimately bring about its destruction, and his."

Agreed.  This is something that's bothered me for a long time, and a major point as to why even the Three have something seriously wrong with their very nature.  I've always found it curious that, even from Tolkien himself, there isn't much criticism of the Elven rings as actually in big part representing something profane, despite the (completely) understandable intention behind them."

That all seems like a backdoor cheat to me, really, and I think that this cheat is leveraging the Melkor-taint to get around the laws of nature, in effect.   I love your post, but this strikes me as incorrect.  The elvish rings don't use Morgoth's taint to hold back the effects of time.  They cleanse the land of Morgoth's taint.  Nothing evil came into Rivendell, and on the land of Lorien no shadow lay.  This cleansing eliminated the fading that affected the elves of Middle Earth.    Now this fading accumulated over time, so it's true that the Rings effectively hold back the effects of time insofar as it causes them to fade from Morgoth's taint, but not otherwise."

tolkienfans,39vg6l,skysinsane,2,Mon Jun 15 07:29:51 2015 UTC,"Not the Three, according to Tolkien's letter 131, where he describes (among other things; it is a very long letter) the basic cosmogony and history of Arda.   The Elves of Eregion made Three supremely beautiful and powerful rings, almost solely of their own imagination, and directed to the preservation of beauty: they did not confer invisibility. [...]   The One (made solely by Sauron) conferred it.  Perhaps the Seven and the Nine (made by the Mírdain but taken and altered by Sauron) did.  Certainly the Nine conferred it eventually, after their bearers had been fully consumed by them.  So perhaps invisibility was an unavoidable side-effect (at least upon Men) of Sauron's work on them."
tolkienfans,39vg6l,Uluithiad,2,Mon Jun 15 16:16:08 2015 UTC,"Huh, that's interesting.  I was under the impression that gandalf said something like that when he was talking about how he figured out that it was the one ring.   Perhaps he said that only the great rings could confer invisibility, rather than that all of them could.   Edit: Found the relevant conversation from Fellowship -    A mortal, Frodo, who keeps one of the Great Rings, does not die, but he does not grow or obtain more life, he merely continues, until at last every minute is a weariness. And if he often uses the Ring to make himself invisible, he  fades:  he becomes in the end invisible permanently   this implies that any great ring can be used for invisibility   I wondered often how Gollum came by a Great Ring, as plainly it was – that at least was clear from the first.   showing that invisibility is therefore a great ring only trait.   ...  Without your source, I would assume all great rings can confer invisibility, but with it I would agree that only the ones touched by Sauron have that power.  However, it is strange that a holder of one of the exception rings wouldn't make that distinction. Perhaps Tolkien changed his mind at some point?"

If Gandalf is wrong we have pretty much 0 knowledge, though I don't see how he would think that all great rings could turn people invisible when he had one of the exceptions as his own to test.  More edits: Galadriel was able to turn her ring invisible with some power connected to the rings(frodo was able to see it since he was the ringbearer). This suggests that her ring at least has power to use invisibility."
tolkienfans,39vg6l,skysinsane,8,Mon Jun 15 17:43:41 2015 UTC,"I suppose all Three were like that: their wearers could wear them secretly, if they so decided.  The hand remained visible to ordinary eyes; the ring upon it did not.  We know that Gandalf wore Narya.  We also know that Saruman discovered this, because he was skilled at such discoveries.  This implies that it was not all and sundry who could see Narya on his finger.  Even Saruman had to research the matter; he did not merely glance at Gandalf's hand and notice the ring.  In the chapter The Grey Havens Elrond and Galadriel are specifically described with their rings Vilya and Nenya.  Gandalf is specifically mentioned as now openly wearing Narya.  But the appearances of all three persons have been described before in the tale, with no mention of rings.  Not even when they gathered in Minas Tirith for Aragorn's and Arwen's wedding, after the One had been destroyed and the power of the Three had either already weakened or been altogether removed.  This indicates that the Three did not immediately become inert with the passing of the One.  Either they maintained, for a while, some of their old power, or else their bearers could conceal any ring, and kept concealing the Three for a while even after they had become inert.  When Gandalf spoke of the Great Rings conferring invisibility, he may have deliberately held this back from Frodo: that he himself wore one of the Three.  And/or he may have spoken of Great Rings and in this context, while instructing a pupil who did not need to know everything, implied only rings made or tainted by Sauron.  Any of those rings would confer invisibility; Frodo didn't need to know that the Three, to Gandalf perfectly accounted for, were different in that regard.  Alternatively Tolkien may have waffled on the issue.  He did change his opinion on a good many things during the long time that he wrote and tinkered with his legendarium.  Or maybe he omitted a bit of context: any Great Ring would confer invisibility to a Mortal (that was what Frodo needed to know), but the Three were made for and always held by powerful immortals, and upon their fingers would confer no invisibility (hence the remark in the letter).  If Gandalf had let Frodo put on Narya, would he have become invisible?"

He believes that Aragorn has the power to wrest it away from him, if given enough time, while Tolkien tells us that only a being on Sauron's level (another Maiar, specifically Gandalf) would have any hope of doing so. This is why he strikes out at Gondor before he planned, leaving large armies in reserve in Mordor because they had not yet mustered.

Different set of 'physics'. Invisible in the mortal world made you more visible in the spiritual world. I would say he knew, at it was nature to him. And it works to his advantage.

tolkienfans,39vg6l,PrivateChicken,3,Mon Jun 15 04:28:38 2015 UTC,"Ah, now that is interesting. But as Sauron is a Maiar he already exists in both worlds.   As Sauron poured his power into the one ring, is it safe to presume he lost the ability to walk unclad without form, much like Melkor did after corrupting Arda with his power?  Perhaps it does allow him to interact with the spirit world more easily in that case.   If so, I'll say that the way mortals are almost entirely shifted into the spirit world is an unintended effect, as the one ring was meant for Sauron alone. It's effect on mortals would be of little interest to him, as he planned on keeping it forever. The Effect of the Nine (And possibly the Seven) of slowly shifting mortals into the spirit world is almost certainly intentional."
tolkienfans,39vg6l,space_toaster,8,Mon Jun 15 04:46:37 2015 UTC,"He didn't lose his power to take on any form after forging the ring, he lost that ability after the sinking of Numenor when he went down with Ar-Pharazon's fleet. He was a bit caught off guard by the response, you could say.  I haven't read anything claiming that he couldn't walk unclad, just that he couldn't take on a fair seeming form anymore. He was actually unclad for quite a long time after he fell at the end of the Second Age. He probably just didn't feel the need to do so, what with the Ringwraiths to command and the palantir from Minas Ithil to peer through. I suspect that he may have also been more powerful in a physical form. More manifest in the world that way. The Valar and Maiar also took on physical forms to accomplish certain works more easily somehow, but I don't know the details about that.  I do believe that the effect of the rings upon mortals was an unintended side-effect, since all of the rings were made for Elves to begin with (except for the one of course). The seven and the nine were just Elven rings that Sauron pawned off on Dwarves and Men in an attempt to snare them. He succeeded with the men, obviously, but not so much with the Dwarves (so he took them all back, or at least the ones that weren't destroyed by dragon fire). Sauron also took back the nine after their bearers became wraiths and fell under his power entirely, which is interesting, and horrible to contemplate."
tolkienfans,39vg6l,dangerousdave2244,1 point,Mon Jun 15 04:57:05 2015 UTC,"I thought he was unable to leave his physical form voluntarily after he forged the ring. If he could why didn't he moonwalk out of Barad Dur at the end of the Second age, instead of getting his ass killed by Gil-Galad and Elendil?   He spent most of the third age rebuilding a body, I'm not entirely sure why he'd bother if he could still force his will upon others. He was never much of a fighter anyway, the ring mostly augmented his ability to dominate the minds of others. I don't believe he needed a physical body to wield the ring either, he managed to lug it back to middle earth somehow after he was killed by Eru Illuvitar dumpstering Numenor."

You know, the sort who put their toddlers in padded castles rather than risk that they stumble and skin their knees, and later will accompany their adult children to job interviews and do most of the talking.  When Eru created persons: Ainur and Eruhíni, he permitted them free will, and a measure of freedom to act out that will, in wisdom or folly.  That way they were not given free will for naught; and they could learn the better.  The Story that they participated in would be of their own making as much as his.

For he that attempteth this shall prove but mine instrument in the devising of things more wonderful, which he himself hath not imagined.

If Eru fixed every ill wrought by Melkor or others what freedom could his children be said to have?  Furthermore, when we look at beings like the seven Dwarven fathers who, prior to Eru's intervention, lack free will, it doesn't make sense to describe them in terms of receiving benevolence or malevolence. They were merely automatons acting out Aulë's will, as the Ainur and other Children would be to Eru they had not received free will.

We learn a little bit from just this. He is the one. There are no other Illuvatar like creatures floating around Ea. As the all father (a name also used in Norse mythology to refer to Odin who ironically didn't create the universe in Norse mythology) he is responsiple for the creation of everything. He let the Ainuir do some of the work but all power comes from him.  In Tolkien's eyes Eru Illuvatar is just another name for YHWH, Allah, Johavah, arguably Brahman. Tolkien was a devout Christian. In his eyes Eru Illuvatar would eventually have a son named Jesus. We know that the Numenoreans and the Gondorians worshiped Eru. The Gondorians seem to view the Valar the same way the Catholic Church views angles, as mighty beings that they may apeal to for help but not worship. (Im not Catholic so I apologize if I am misunderstanding)  From what I have said above we can answer your other questions. Eru is omnipotent, omniscent, and omnibenevolent. However, as stated in the Silmirilion he gave the entities he created free will and thus he acts through the Ainuir so that he does not have to use his full power against them. Him correcting the themes of Melkor was less about power and more about him respecting free will as much as possible."

In order to combat their fallen servant, the Valar sent five Maiar spirits to Middle-Earth. Contemporaries of Sauron, these five spirits were clad in the bodies of old men by the Valar, so as to limit their power and prevent the men of Middle-Earth from fearing them. The Five Istari came to Middle-Earth in TA 1000 and by TA 3019, only two of them remained. The Wizards, as men often named the Istari walked on Middle-Earth for over two thousand years, aging very slowly, for their immortal, divine spirits succored their mortal frames immensely."

tolkienfans,39n3c1,Zankou55,55,Fri Jun 12 22:33:16 2015 UTC,Well I don't know for sure but I'm assuming that Tolkien was writing till very close up to his death and the Silmarillion is the coming together of these connected works. Purely my conjecture tho I don't know what actually happened
tolkienfans,39n3c1,WizardBrownbeard,32,Fri Jun 12 22:44:21 2015 UTC,"Yes, he was working on Middle-Earth up until the very last weeks of his life, and planning significant revisions and reconceptualization of the world.  You can see some of his musings in Morgoth's Ring.  Christopher Tolkien describes another, and perhaps the latest, in Unfinished Tales:   A wholly different story, adumbrated but never told, of Galadriel's conduct at the time of the rebellion of the Noldor appears in a very late and partly illegible note:  the last writing of my father's on the subject of Galadriel and Celeborn, and probably the last on Middle-Earth and Valinor, set down in the last month of his life...  ...This story... is profoundly at variance with all that is said elsewhere...  That it would have entailed a good deal of alteration in the narrative of The Silmarillion is evident; but that my father doubtless intended to do.   I'm not sure how much hope Tolkien had of actually being able to finish these plans, but he had already entrusted his literary estate to his son Christopher - an accomplished scholar in his own right, and among the very first readers of Lord of the Rings."
tolkienfans,39n3c1,Evan_Th,13,Sat Jun 13 02:09:14 2015 UTC,This is the most logical answer. I'm sure Christopher didn't want to compile everything before the information was definitive. Tolkien was often changing his writings especially in Sil content.
tolkienfans,39n3c1,Scorponix,19,Fri Jun 12 23:16:15 2015 UTC,"Humphrey Carpenter's biography has this to say:  ""Some years previously, he had decided that in the event of his dying before the book was finished, Christopher (who was of course well versed in the work) should complete it for publication. He and Christopher often discussed the book, contemplating the numerous problems that remained to be solved; but they made little progress.""  So Christopher was actively discussing the work with his father, but of course to step in and take charge himself would have been unthinkable as long as his father held any hope of completing the work himself. And it seems that Tolkien had anticipated more years to finish the book than he had. (Even just a week before his death, he wrote to a colleague and commented on feeling much improved having just gotten over a bout of poor health.)"

tolkienfans,39n3c1,25willp,6,Sat Jun 13 07:30:55 2015 UTC,"Heres some conjecture for you; I'm a writer. I was born a writer. I never started really working on a book for OTHER people until I was 25. In fact, until this moment that I'm speaking of now, I ONLY wrote for me, and I practiced and practiced and sometimes showed people who would give me much praise, and still, my work was not perfect enough. I feel like Tolkien, was, himself, a perfectionist, like me. With grand ideas about what he would do, not because of some perceived arrogance but because of a lack of ceiling on the medium he was creating. A world he could escape too. A chance to be a true explorer.  My friend Danny was shot. He was from Puerto Rico and had went back for a while, and while out at a dance club he must have danced with the wrong girl, or maybe he was drinking and had some altercation... I don't know the details of the conflict to be honest. He was one of the most peaceful, happy guys I know. He did have a little temper with disrespect but who doesn't.  He was shot in the back of the head twice, for whatever that thing was.  No one around me understood why It effected me so much. We hadn't been close in high school, and it had been years since we last talked. But every time I thought about him, I thought about meeting my first girlfriend with him, and chasing her and his sister through our apartment complex with him. I remember how he used to be, always had something funny to say. His optimism taught me how to always be optimistic. The buildings we grew up in, they had been condemned and knocked down. I knew how no one remembered him, or those days like I did. He was a blip on the map of the world, from the kind of poor places that a lot of the right wing might tell you doesn't exist. An invisible blip to the world, and I stood there with him in those memories, and suddenly, losing him tore my world apart.  I could not watch all of these lessons and memories be a blip, I could not let us go so quietly. We were trying desperately to escape a poor life and find a rich dream, both in our own ways. Our journey's ran parallel, and with the risks I took in my life, all I could think was that, I was here, and he was not here. We followed a dream that maybe wasn't real. Now I just wanted everyone to know, what kind of value the world was losing. We were the kind of boys no one would ever invest in.  I think when Tolkien's father died, he knew what he had to do. He had to complete the work. He was ready for everyone to know the depth of his loss, through the depth of their mutual creation.  theres other answer's in this thread that might offer greater details about Tolkien. But the human answer is the one I would look for, so it is the one I offer perspective on."

It also shows another, related, pattern: things being repeated on a smaller scale.  Just like Aragorn and Arwen's love is ultimately a smaller reflection of the love of Thingol and Melian, Shelob trying to eat the diminished light of the Trees is but a smaller reflection of Ungoliant eating the actual Light of the Trees, or trying to eat the Silmarils."
tolkienfans,39lc53,rexbarbarorum,28,Fri Jun 12 17:16:07 2015 UTC,"I always thought of Aragorn and Arwen's love more to that of Luthien and Beren, and I think Tolkien meant it that way too."

I wanted to go back to the first iteration of that theme, which was Thingol and Melian.  (But there's no doubt Tolkien wanted to make a connection between Aragorn-Arwen and Beren-Luthien; it's heavily implied throughout LotR!)"

tolkienfans,39lc53,Glitterbritches,7,Thu Jun 18 16:08:15 2015 UTC,"Definately.  The diminishing part is key IMO.  While Tolkien does use repetition of events, I think the overall theme to his work is each generation of people, places and things is a little weaker than what came before.  The repetition helps reinforce that."
tolkienfans,39lc53,Rayf_Brogan,8,Fri Jun 12 17:47:01 2015 UTC,"Agreed, the lessening of the generations (but of similar ""make"" is a big theme.    Honestly, this is one of the few aspects of Tolkien's worldview that doesn't sit well with me.  While it does give his writing-and Arda itself- a melancholy and poignant beauty, I don't like that it views true progress, improvement, and betterment as a virtual impossibility.  That the best can really be ahead, and not behind."
tolkienfans,39lc53,TemporalOasis,7,Fri Jun 12 22:59:41 2015 UTC,"Hmmm. The best is ahead, in a sense, with the remaking of the world. I agree that diminishing is undoubtably a huge theme, though I think the biggest theme of all is that all things must come to an end; good or evil, as part of a grand purpose. The takeaway being that fate (i.e. The will of illuvatar or God) is the primary catalyst of all change and that there should be comfort in the absoluteness and surety of his way. Maybe those themes are similar enough to be encompassed together. I'd also be skeptical of the person and persons (Bilbo and the elves of Rivendel) dictating and writing the story of The Silmarillion (from which we get a reference for later events in terms of grandeur.) If you'd ask someone today about their grandparents generation, surely they'd use exhultory language in describing their achievements. And an interesting story, which surely Bilbo set out to write, is filled with hyperbole. Tolkien himself is prone to the whole ""he was the greatest _____"" or ""she was the most [adjective] [noun] that ever lived."""
tolkienfans,39lc53,MadOX5792,3,Sat Jun 13 02:49:01 2015 UTC,"It does fit with the idea of Tolkien often framing himself as an unreliable narrator who was (along with the characters themselves who served ""sources"" to him), either unsure or ignorant of certain details...sometimes major ones.  As you mentioned, the Silmarillion is rife with it.  That being said, the idea of the incomparable/heroic past seems to be one fairly meaningful to Tolkien.    Interesting thought about the process being a subset for the divine plan, and implicitly the remaking of Arda into a grander world in the end.  It works, but to me it still seems a bit dubious that it requires that every age, hero, never fail to be but a shadow of the last version.  It seems almost insulting.  I have the utmost admiration for Tolkien's worldview (it's profoundly beautiful and hopeful in a way I've rarely if ever encountered elsewhere), but I can't help but suspect that Eru could and would have other tricks up his sleeve throughout the ages."
tolkienfans,39lc53,TemporalOasis,3,Sat Jun 13 19:55:13 2015 UTC,"to me it still seems a bit dubious that it requires that every age, hero, never fail to be but a shadow of the last version.    I don't think it requires that, I think it's just as impressive that Samwise fought Shelob as Fingolfin dueling Morgoth.   Fingolfin was King of the Noldor, the eldest son of Finwe, he was capable of great deeds. After Dagor Bragollach he was desperate, and enraged so he rode to Angbad and stood alone against the greatest of the Ainu.   Sam was not a warrior, let alone a great one. He was a gardener, capable of raising carrots not armies. But in the pass above Cirith Ungol he saw his master killed and the hope to save Middle Earth fail. In desperation he fights a foe he cannot hope to defeat just as Fingolfin did.  If Fingolfin had fought Shelob, it would not have been impressive because he was strong enough to match her. We are privileged to know what the characters in the third age are thinking, we know their fears. I don't think it's outrageous to assert that the first age characters felt the same things, we just don't know it due to narrative style. I think that in their minds, the same experience occurs in both characters. From the outside we might say the Fingolfin's deed was greater, but internally, the were the same. A major theme (possibly the main theme) of Tolkein's work is ordinary people finding the courage to do extraordinary things when it would be easier to stay away. Through that lens, the acts of the war of the ring are not diminished shadows of previous events but equal to them. The problems have changed, but the courage to face them has not."
tolkienfans,39lc53,Somedamnguy,12,Wed Jun 17 16:22:57 2015 UTC,Well put. You said exactly what I was thinking (and trying to communicate in my post).  I find it interesting that some people think that Ungoliant wasn't part of the Music... I think this passage makes it clear that she (and Shelob) were integral parts of the battle between good and evil.  P.S. Had to look up leitmotif. That is a great word to describe this idea...
tolkienfans,39lc53,Uluithiad,17,Fri Jun 12 17:20:56 2015 UTC,"I feel the need to point out that 'and it did not daunt her' is not describing Shelob's reaction to the light from the Phial of Galadriel. It is describing her reaction to the Elvish cry that rang out from Frodo when he used the Phial of Galadriel. In that sense, it is comparable to how the Lord of the Nazgul was in part driven off by a similar cry in 'A Knife in the Dark'.  The light, on the other hand, did daunt her. She does not possess her mother's fortitude against that holy light. That's the whole point of the phial in this chapter, how it is effective against Shelob."

tolkienfans,39lc53,rexbarbarorum,6,Sat Jun 13 02:16:40 2015 UTC,"Orthogonal to this, and surely something Tolkien would’ve been keenly aware of, is Christianity’s propensity to this sort of literary typing. The books of the New Testament, particularly the Pauline epistles and the epistle to the Hebrews, go to great lengths to outline the Christ as being prefigured in various Old Testament persons—particularly in Adam, in Joseph, and in David—but this time the hero (Christ) is successful.  Back in Middle Earth, Sauron and Morgoth can be painted this way, right? You could surely draw a lot of parallels between them; even their origin is largely the same, just a step down the organizational chart. Morgoth’s rebellion, rise to power, and defeat all hugely prefigure Sauron’s.  Sam, I think, is spot-on in his assessment, and, if we place it in terms of the Music, I think that Ungoliant is definitely a motif that’s intentionally repeated for dramatic effect in Shelob."
tolkienfans,39lc53,DirtD4er,4,Fri Jun 12 17:22:43 2015 UTC,"Spot on. Biblical exegesis that focuses on typology is very similar to what Tolkien does.

If he gave one out, while the person would be corrupted they would not be tied to Sauron's will.  Sauron we're told only maintained absolute control of the Nazgul because he possessed the Nine Rings.  Giving another out, before he reclaimed the One, could do him more harm than good if this new bearer chose to act against him.  I believe his offer to the Dwarves is that he'd reward them with a Ring should they provide him with information leading him to the ""trifle he desires"", the ""least of Rings"" (if I remember my quote right)."

One could suppose that, under pressing need, Sauron might have given one of the seven to a new servant, but there was no such pressing need.

It's semi-plausible... sorta.... not really (at least of it is portrayed in game).  Elven spirits when they die are summoned to the Halls of Mandos.  However this isn't mandatory. Some may refuse and wander Middle-Earth disembodied.  Tolkien does remark that any elf that chose this though was probably not the most friendly in the first place though.  These spirits could be very dangerous to the embodied and could even try to possess a body and eject its rightful owners soul out of it.  However, how this is portrayed in game is vastly different what what info we have (all the powers the game gives), and an elf like Celebrimbor would not likely be one to refuse the summons of Mandos.

Regardless, the game could have easily used an old and tried set up with what's already been adapted but instead they use a pretty obscure character, which is nice. Celebrimbor ins particular was always a character I wanted more on, he is integral to the story in his own way after all."
tolkienfans,39l61i,EyeceEyeceBaby,5,Fri Jun 12 14:58:57 2015 UTC,"I imagine if Fëanor answered the summons even after swearing his oath, Celebrimbor would as well. Celebrimbor also wasn't as hot-headed and impassioned as his grandfather. If he was, I think rather than hiding the Rings he might have attempted to use them to defeat Sauron. I imagine he would have preferred Mandos and reincarnation in Valinor to haunting men and seeking revenge in Middle-Earth.  So yes, the mechanism used in the game isn't completely at odds with lore, but I think the portrayal or choice of Celebrimbor is. Perhaps it would have been better to invent a different elf, some previously unnamed relative or lover of Celebrimbor's who wished to avenge him (if they wanted to be accurate to Tolkien)."
tolkienfans,39l61i,Evan_Th,2,Fri Jun 12 15:41:29 2015 UTC,"I imagine if Fëanor answered the summons even after swearing his oath, Celebrimbor would as well. Celebrimbor also wasn't as hot-headed and impassioned as his grandfather. If he was, I think rather than hiding the Rings he might have attempted to use them to defeat Sauron.   We know very little about Celebrimbor, but we have a very brief treatment of him in Unfinished Tales.  In one of his several biographical sketches of Galadriel, Tolkien outlines how Sauron (in his disguise as Annatar) infiltrated Celebrimbor's guild of smiths and stirred them to rebel against Celeborn and Galadriel, who were ruling Eregion.  That seems to hint Celebrimbor just might refuse the Summons.  However, right afterwards, we have this flat statement:   Celebrimbor was not corrupted in heart or faith, but had accepted Sauron as what he posed to be.   So, unless we throw out this essay altogether, Celebrimbor, being uncorrupted, would not have refused the Summons.  Now we definitely could throw out this essay; Tolkien wrote several other contradictory histories of Galadriel.  But, I see no specific reason to do so."
tolkienfans,39l61i,Edledhron,3,Sat Jun 13 02:18:34 2015 UTC,"I think the idea is Celebrimbor has changed, inbetween life and death.   Celebrimbor was slain. For him, there is no in between life and death. He was simply dead, as his body and spirit were separated. Whatever happened to his spirit afterwards is relevant to the fact that he is dead.  Secondly, an elf that lingers in the world after their death is not a wraith. They are termed as 'Houseless.' A 'wraith' is a specific thing in Tolkien's world, and you can't just apply the generic understanding of what a wraith is to it - just like you can't grab any particular term from folk knowledge and assume that Tolkien's use of it is the same (e.g. another example is that 'gnome' specifically refers to one of the Noldor). In Tolkien's mythos, a wraith is a living being (meaning their body and spirit have not been separated, and they are still corporeal), but they have faded into the unseen realm.   Houseless elves could inhabit non-animated objects, such as a tree, and likely even reanimate a corpse (such as the barrow wights) though such an act would be seen as wicked and presumably quite painful for the spirit doing it. The Houseless can also enter into a living body if admitted, and from there either co-exist, or what often happened, attempt to eject the owner's spirit for mastery of the body -- a process that usually resulted in the body's death. A Houseless elf could not bring a man back to life, nor could it give such a man magical powers."
tolkienfans,39l61i,HannasAnarion,0,Fri Jun 12 18:32:17 2015 UTC,"The state he is in during Shadow of Mordor is inbetween life and death, however. Its what the game describes it as, too."

tolkienfans,39l61i,1_wing_angel,2,Fri Jun 12 22:36:34 2015 UTC,"They were 'evil spirits' sent by Angmar to descend upon the barrows. What exactly these spirits are is not made clear, but I think some houseless in Sauron's command (and used by the Witch-king) is a possible candidate.  They aren't wraiths. The bodies are clearly dead and have been reanimated through some means."
tolkienfans,39l61i,HannasAnarion,1 point,Fri Jun 12 22:45:02 2015 UTC,"There is no evidence that the wights had rings of power.  Are you asking if they are elvish or human spirits?  The answer is probably the former, as elvish spirits are tied to Arda, while no one knows what happens to human souls after death (Beren being the exception to this rule).  Both Sauron and the Nazgul had power over spirits - Sauron was known as the Necromancer, and the Morgul King reanimated the brow wights during his search for the Ring."
tolkienfans,39l61i,fileg,-1,Sun Jun 14 17:00:40 2015 UTC,"and an elf like Celebrimbor would not likely be one to refuse the summons of Mandos.   The game Celebrimbor totally would. In the video game, Celebrimbor's character is restyled as a villain."

There is nothing to that extent that I know of. However, in The Silmarillion there are many instances where Melkor's captives, both elves and men, are described as being thralls. The following passage gives good context regarding the elves:   Many of the Noldor and the Sindar they took captive and led to Angband, and made them thralls, forcing them to use their skill and their knowledge in the service of Morgoth. And Morgoth sent out his spies, and they were clad in false forms and deceit was in their speech; they made lying promises of reward, and with conning words sought to arouse fear and jealousy among the peoples, accusing their kings and chieftains of greed, and of treachery one to another. And because of the curse of the Kinslaying at Alqualondë these lies were often believed; and indeed as the time darkened they had a measure of truth, for the hearts and minds of the Elves of Beleriand became clouded with despair and fear. But ever the Noldor feared most the treachery of those of their own kin, who had been thralls in Angband; for Morgoth used some of these for his evil purposes, and feigning to give them liberty sent them abroad, but their wills were chained to his, and they strayed only to come back to him again. Therefore if any of his captives escaped in truth, and returned to their own people, they had little welcome, and wandered alone outlawed and desperate."
tolkienfans,39l61i,ReinierPersoon,3,Fri Jun 12 15:05:10 2015 UTC,"The Barrow-wight that Bombadil banished could have been an elvish spirit.  It's origins are unclear.  But it could be the spirit of an evil elf who refused to obey the summons to the Halls of Mandos.  If the orcs originated as elves, and refuse to obey the summons of Mandos, they could turn into wraiths or wights.    Celebrimbor was not evil.  Although some of the things he did were wrong he was more misguided and proud than evil.  It seems unlikely that he would refuse the summons of Mandos.  But I suppose if his pride bound him even after his body died, it's possible that he would wander Middle-earth as a neutral spirit.  That might be true of other elves as well.  So yes, I think you could plausibly have both neutral and evil elvish spirits haunting Middle-earth."

However, Celembrimbor's wraith form in the game is not the kind of wraith that is described in Morgoth's Ring:  ""It is summoned; and the summons proceeds from just authority, and is imperative; yet it may be refused. [... It was less frequent [to refuse the summons of Mandos], however, in ancient days, while Morgoth was in Arda, or his servant Sauron after him; for then the fea unbodied would flee in terror of the Shadow to any refuge - unless it were already committed to the Darkness and passed then into its dominion. In like manner even of the Eldar some who had become corrupted refused the summons, and then had little power to resist the counter-summons of Morgoth."""

It's also possible that they refused the summons to the Halls of Mandos, rather than being denied such a summons.    Tolkien's friend C.S. Lewis once said ""I willingly believe that the damned are, in one sense, successful, rebels to the end; that the doors of hell are locked on the inside.""  Tolkien seems to follow that rule.  Damned souls do not go to a hell outside of Arda, rather, they create their own hell in Arda.  Angband and Mordor are versions of hell, but so, perhaps, are the Caves of the Forgotten.  Edit:  Another version of hell is technically outside of Arda.  Morgoth was thrust through the Door of Night into the Void, excluded from Arda until the Final Battle is fought and Arda is remade.  Bombadil may have banished the Barrow-wight to the same place, although the wording is ambiguous:  Get out, you old wight! Vanish in the sunlight!  Shrivel like the cold mist, like the winds go wailing,  Out into the barren lands far beyond the mountains!  Come never here again! Leave your barrow empty!

tolkienfans,39gap4,wjbc,5,Thu Jun 11 16:21:21 2015 UTC,"I have a small follow-up question for you: Seeing as hobbits are derived from men, did they also go to the Halls?"

Dwarves, on the other hand, apparently sleep until the Final Battle, except for Durin I, who gets resurrected every few generations.

tolkienfans,39gap4,PrivateChicken,4,Thu Jun 11 17:58:35 2015 UTC,"Ah, that is true. Perhaps Men stay for different lengths of time like in Purgatory, because there are some mentions that some Elves are reincarnated sooner than others. Perhaps this also goes for Men."

Clearly the Gift of Men could be rescinded in the case of Ar-Pharazon, but can the gift be rejected outright?  I would imagine that like elves, men could refuse the summons to Mandos. If so, perhaps it is only once they reach Mandos that they leave the circles of the world, that is, it's not so much a refusal of the gift, but a refusal of the summons which then delays the gift."

But Ar-Pharazôn the King and the mortal warriors that had set foot upon the land of Aman were buried under falling hills: there it is said that they lie imprisoned in the Caves of the Forgotten, until the Last Battle and the Day of Doom.   To your first question, no. The fleet itself is most certainly dead and gone, ""swallowed up for ever."" As for the King and his warriors, the text is ambiguous enough that they might be still alive, but I imagine it's more likely that they are indeed dead. For one, the undying lands don't make mortals immortal. The only man ever explicitly noted to have been granted immortality was Tuor, and Tolkien used the ""it is said"" clause with him as well, leaving his fate somewhat ambiguous also. The fact is, Dagor Dagorath was never fully fleshed out to a final form. We know that Turin at least would be returning from the ""Doom of Men,"" so I imagine Ar-Pharazôn and his men would return just the same. Their bodies remain imprisoned, but I don't think they are somehow alive, sustained all these millennia until the Last Battle."
tolkienfans,39gap4,italia06823834,4,Thu Jun 11 15:48:06 2015 UTC,It would be a just/ironic punishment to make him immortal but trapped forever in his prison.

tolkienfans,39gap4,EyeceEyeceBaby,3,Fri Jun 12 15:46:27 2015 UTC,"Actually Tolkien said it in a letter:   As for Frodo and other mortals, they could only dwell in Aman for a limited time - whether brief or long. The Valar had neither the power nor the right to confer 'immortality' upon them. Their sojourn was a 'purgatory', but one of peace and healing and they would eventually pass away (die at their own desire and of free will) to destinations of which the Elves knew nothing. - Letter 325   But I agree, it's the word choice of ""lie imprisoned"" that makes their fate ambiguous. I think if not for that, we could be certain that they did indeed die. As it stands, I think its likely they passed away but it's tough to be certain."

tolkienfans,39f53n,magradhaid,1 point,Fri Jun 19 08:45:01 2015 UTC,Isn't it the drink known as Miruvor? Or is that just the elvish word for wine or mead?
tolkienfans,39f53n,Wiles_,6,Thu Jun 11 12:18:52 2015 UTC,"Miruvor is not merely the Elvish word for wine or mead, so I ended up writing up a fairly long post on the topic:  Rivendell's cordial is said to be a ""warm and fragrant liquor,"" and in Namárie lisse-miruvóre is translated as ""sweet mead"" or ""sweet nectar."" We find a concept of miruvóre in Tolkien's earlier legendarium, where it is ""nectar, drink of the Valar, sweet drink"": but back then, mir(u) in Elvish was instead linked with ""wine"" (with derivatives like ""wine-red"" and ""grape""), so the composition of the drink itself may have changed in later decades (along with the etymology).  Here's a collection (not listed in chronological order) of Tolkien's conflicting/evolving statements on miruvor, found in The Road Goes Ever On, Quendi & Eldar, and in Parma Eldalamberon 17:   In RGEO, which was published during his lifetime in Oct. 1967 (he sent the notes and calligraphy to Donald Swann in March) and therefore arguably IMO the closest to 'canon': Tolkien says that miruvóre is: ""According to the Eldar, a word derived from the language of the Valar; the name that they gave to the drink poured out at their festivals. Its making and the meaning of its name were not known for certain, but the Eldar believed it to be made from the honey of the undying flowers in the gardens of Yavanna, though it was clear and translucent. [...]""   However, before he settled on that explanation, he tossed around other possibilities:  Quendi & Eldar (c. 1959-60) notes that: ""miruvóre, miruvor 'a special wine or cordial'. V[alarin] mirubhōzē-; said to be the beginning of a longer word, containing the element mirub- 'wine'.""  In PE17 (where the editor, Christopher Gilson, uses ¶ to mark separate documents or significant revisions), we find many differing explanations/theories for the word:  p 37-38: ""S   miruvor. Sindarin form taken by borrowed Quenya word: Q miruvórë ""precious juice"": √MIR ""esteem, value"" [...] [miruvórë < miru̯(a)-wōrĭ. wōri-, juice, esp. of fruit, is < √WOR-, express, cause to exude (by pressure). Not found in Sindarin.] [...] This is false etymology. High Elvish. There was not in fact any word wor- in Elvish, Quenya or Sindarin.    ¶ The word was thought of as precious drink (and largely of honey) but word was of Valarin origin. mirubhōze, a honey wine, mirub, wine.""  [As part of Words, Phrases, and Passages, those entries are likely from the late 50s or early 60s; Gilson notes that ""The final note on the Valarin origin of the word was added later in ball-point"".]  p.64: ""Q  miruvóre (cf. miruvor, I 323) drink of the Elves. Etymology? Valian. ¶ miruvōre was name of a mead or nectar drunk in Valinor.  [Derivation: supposed to be from *midu, the Valinorean name + Elvish wōse. There was naturally no Sindarin equivalent.]""    [The above is from NGS: ""Some linguistic notes on Galadriel's song, which according to Gilson ""cannot be precisely dated, but is based on the 1st edition text"".]  p.64 cont.: ""¶ miruvóre is said to be in origin a 'Valarin' word (reduced and Eldarinized).† A drink of which the Elves did not know the ingredients or making. [Commentary on the Nainie of Galadriel.] The name miruvor (reduced as númenóre > númenor) is applied to a cordial made in Rivendell (L.R. I 304). This is the same word, but applied to a drink, probably made basically of honey (of ?scented flowers). The Elves said they thought the miruvóre of the Valar was made of the honey/nectar of certain flowers in the gardens of Valinor. †Its actual origin is Germanic među [mead] + wōþi 'sweet' (in Gothic form midu-wōþei(s)) supposed to go through miđuwōđi > miřuwōři.""  [Gilson notes that this last section is from ""Some Quenya notes arising during revision of L.R. (March 1967),"" which may be the same March 1967 document the editors quote in PE12:xi:   ""Its actual origin as an 'invention' goes back to at least 1915, its real source being Gothic *midu (= Gmc. među) + wotheis, then supposed to have been developed so: miđuwōþi > miđuwōđi > miřuwōři > miruvóre.""  They note that ""The primitive Germanic stem među 'mead' is reconstructible from Anglo-Saxon medu, meodu, Old Norse mjǫðr and Old High German metu, and its form in Gothic readily inferred, although it is not actually attested. The Gothic adjective wōþeis 'sweet' is given in Wright's Primer"", with a footnote that ""The Gothic form is usually reconstructed as a masculine noun *midus, the form that would theoretically correspond to the other Germanic cognates. Tolkien's reconstructed *midu has the form of a neuter noun, and is probably based on the fact that in the primitive Indo-European language this word was neuter, as shown by the Greek cognate μέθυ 'wine' and Sanskrit mádhu 'honey, sweet drink'.""  Another editorial footnote remarks that ""The compound miđuwōþi may have been inspired by the English flower-name meadow-sweet, which is a folk-etymological reinterpretation of older meadsweet, and probably based on another name for the plant, regina prati 'queen of the meadow'. The first element of meadsweet also appears in the even older meadwort, descended from Anglo-Saxon medu-wyrt 'mead flower'. The names are explained by the fact that the flower (Spiræa ulmaria) is used for flavoring mead.""]"

tolkienfans,39dqi1,tobymoby616,0,Fri Jun 12 02:28:47 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure he even said in his letters that Sam was the main character, or in his words, ""the principal hero"" of the story."
tolkienfans,39dqi1,HannasAnarion,4,Fri Jun 12 06:25:34 2015 UTC,He absolutely did not say Sam was the main character. You are twisting that passage to the extreme.
tolkienfans,39dqi1,Uluithiad,1 point,Fri Jun 12 21:00:07 2015 UTC,"No, not really. It's pretty clear. He repeatedly calls Sam the ""chief hero"", which he uses in the same way that contemporary scholars use ""main character"" (a phrase that Tolkien himself doesn't use).   131   But the highest love-story, that of Aragorn and Arwen Elrond's daughter is only alluded to as a known thing. It is told elsewhere in a short tale. Of Aragorn and Arwen Undómiel. I think the simple 'rustic' love of Sam and his Rosie (nowhere elaborated) is absolutely essential to the study of his (the chief hero's) character, and to the theme of the relation of ordinary life (breathing, eating, working, begetting) and quests, sacrifice, causes, and the 'longing for Elves', and sheer beauty.   184   It was very kind of you to write. You can imagine my astonishment, when I saw your signature! I can only say, for your comfort I hope, that the 'Sam Gamgee' of my story is a most heroic character, now widely beloved by many readers, even though his origins are rustic.   91   Here is a small consignment of 'The Ring': the last two chapters that have been written, and the end of the Fourth Book of that great Romance, in which you will see that, as is all too easy, I have got the hero into such a fix that not even an author will be able to extricate him without labour and difficulty. Lewis was moved almost to tears by the last chapter.    (referring to Shelob's Lair and the Choices of Master Samwise, in which Sam is the perspective character)"
tolkienfans,39dqi1,HannasAnarion,4,Fri Jun 12 21:13:41 2015 UTC,"Those quotes do not support your argument. You have one quote that calls him the chief hero. You have one quote which calls him a most heroic character. You have a final quote that is without question referring to Frodo, not Sam, as Frodo is the one in such a fix.  Apart from the fact that none of these indicate that whatever hero, whether chief, or one among many, that is being talked about is the main character, you've cherry-picked from Letters to make it seem like Tolkien is always talking about Sam. He talks about Frodo in similar terms just as often.  Letter 131:   So necessarily in The Lord of the Rings, having escaped to Elrond from the imminent pursuit of present evil, the hero departs in a wholly new direction: to go and face it at its source.   Letter 192:   By chance, I have just had another letter regarding the failure of Frodo. Very few seem even to have observed it. But following the logic of the plot, it was clearly inevitable, as an event. And surely it is a more significant and real event than a mere 'fairy-story' ending in which the hero is indomitable?   Both of these unquestionably refer to Frodo as 'the hero'. In fact, since your Letter 184 quote uses the indefinite, Frodo is the one Tolkien repeats as 'the hero' more. By your logic that makes him the main character, not Sam."
tolkienfans,39dqi1,Uluithiad,2,Fri Jun 12 21:35:38 2015 UTC,It makes sense that you would love Sam's speeches. He's the hero!

But Merry and Pippin are also pureblood Fallohides.  What's really different about Frodo is that he's growing transparent, he's fading, he's moving into a different plane of existence, the spirit plane, the other side.  This is a bit of foreshadowing, because it's the plane in which the Undying Lands exist, of this world and yet not of this world.  Elves, especially high elves, have this spirit quality about them, as if they are half in the physical plane and half in the spiritual plane.  Remember what Glorfindel looked like to Frodo when he saw him as he appeared on the ""other side""?  Aragorn, too, has a strong spiritual presence, which is why I think the Nazgul ran from him, and also why he could command the Shadow Host.  Legolas reveals this nature when he walks on top of snow, or has no fear of the Shadow Host in the Paths of the Dead.  He's half ghost himself.  Gimli, on the other hand, is very much of this world, indeed the rings of Sauron did not make dwarves fade, they just made them greedy.  Therefore Gimli has a particularly hard time in the Paths of the Dead, and it is shocking that Gimli might actually have been granted access to the Undying Lands -- not just shocking that he wanted to go, or that he was allowed to go, but that he could go.  Frodo, due to bearing the Ring and also the effects of the Morgul blade, is already part way there.  One more thing, Gandalf was more spirit than body when he returned from the dead on the mountaintop.  Remember the Great Eagle Gwaihir said he was so light, he thought he might float if dropped?  Then Gandalf said something about not dropping him, because he felt weight returning to him.  So that's another example of this duality, physical and spiritual.  And of course, before Gandalf came to Middle-earth he was pure spirit, he had no body, although he likely had the ability to create the illusion of a body."

Hmm, I would hazard a guess than any being that harbors the flame imperishable has the capacity to go to the undying lands. Gimli's fëa would be weaker than Legolas's but not nonexistent. Obviously Gimli couldn't have made the journey on his own, but I don't think it's violating and rules of existence that he did."

A necessary and just reward, considering he had suffered trauma beyond any conventional means of healing.  So, he was given the unique (or at least rare) opportunity to settle in the only place available in Arda that could address something of that nature.    I get why it happens, but I honestly think many many casual readers of the story don't come close to getting what an overwhelming and terrible experience being the Ring Bearer was."

tolkienfans,397htj,sdb2754,2,Wed Jun 10 10:37:42 2015 UTC,"""Shadow world"" might have immediate ""dark"" implications for many, but it could also imply simply ""a world connected to ours, but somehow different"", like DnD's idea of coterminous (sp?) planes of existence?"
tolkienfans,397htj,Orpherischt,1 point,Wed Jun 10 11:41:08 2015 UTC,"Well. Here are my thoughts (for what they are worth)  1) Eldar (not elves in general) exist in both worlds 2) Wraith exist (almost entirely) in the unseen 3) Rings of power (not dwarven) shift the wearer partially to the unseen 4) Prior to the fall of Westernesse, Valinor was a physical place that could be sailed to, and that men could step foot on 5) After Numenor fell, the world was made round  So, I get the feeling that there is only one shadow world (yes, I agree with you that it is not evil, just hidden), and that wraith, valar and eldar all made use of it (personally, I think the connotation of the term shadow world is unfortunate, since it carries a dark and evil image in our minds).   No where have I come across anything saying that Valinor is part of the unseen (and in fact it could not have been originally part of the shadow world). Nowhere do I see anything that says that it was shifted to the shadow world after the fall of the Dunedain. I think the ""shift"" was physical (making it round), not metaphysical (shifting to the unseen world).  The only thing that makes me see it a bit (and it is a stretch) is the fact that Gandalf was lighter when he came back as The White. But, this only says that his Maia nature was immaterial (which I take for granted) it doesn't say that Valinor itself is. Wraith and Spirit can exist in and (at least partially) interact with normal material objects.  Finally, as per another comment, I would like to point out that the fëa is different from the wraith. All sentient beings have a fëa, but only some exist partially in the unseen. Also, some inanimate objects seem to exist in the wraith world.  Anyway, thats how I see it. Please feel free to throw the books at me..."
tolkienfans,397htj,sdb2754,2,Wed Jun 10 12:59:12 2015 UTC,"I'll come back with citations from the books as and when i can remember them, but I think there is enough in the basic ideas to indicate Aman is spiritual by the third age.  It is accessible only by the Straight Road, which seems to be more to do with the metaphysics than the seacraft of the elves.  When Frodo arrives, the description makes it sound a lot like they're passing through some barrier (the spheres spring to mind).  ""It seemed [to Frodo] ... that he grey rain-curtain turned all to silver glass and was rolled back, and he beheld white shores"".  This sounds like the spheres of arda to me.     This isn't solid, it could be some magic around Aman similar to the Girdle of Melian.  I suspect Valinor is  though.     The other thing I'll mention is that Aman seems analogous to a set of other myths which Tolkien seems to take some influence from.  A land in the western sea where the dead go, where the divine are, and from where magic and semi-divine faeries come from.  Avalon is an island to the west which faded from the world.  In some stories it is where the gods lived, in others it is where magical creatures lived.  The Sidhe of Irish tales arrived on the western coast of ireland, burned their ships and made war (sounds like the Noldor?).  Later stories associated them with the Isle of the Young, which was a mystical island where all the magical beings lived/were from/went to (depending on the story), which also faded from the world.  Both are examples of magical lands in the western sea, both associated with faeries or similar semi-divine beings, and both faded, or receded, or somehow else became inaccessible from the material world.  This sounds a lot like 'faerie in the west', which was taken outside the spheres at the changing of the world."

tolkienfans,397htj,uisge-beatha,2,Fri Jun 12 17:38:50 2015 UTC,"Here's a relevant quote about Glorfindel, from FotR:   “‘… And here in Rivendell there live still some of his chief foes: the Elven-wise, lords of the Eldar from beyond the furthest seas. They do not fear the Ringwraiths, for those who have dwelt in the Blessed Realm live at once in both worlds, and against both the Seen and the Unseen they have great power.'   'I thought that I saw a white figure that shone and did not grow dim like the others. Was that Glorfindel then?'

tolkienfans,397htj,wjbc,16,Wed Jun 10 18:20:44 2015 UTC,"There may be two reasons, or perhaps both.  One is that he had a nobility which made him probably the only person during his time who could have brought the Ring as far as Mount Doom (as Tolkien writes in one of his letters).  That nobility may have expressed itself visually by an elvish air, discernible by at least the keen-eyed, such as Faramir (a very perceptive man) and Sam (who knew him very well, and was a good deal more perceptive than he gave himself credit for).  The other reason, as you noticed, may be the after-effect of his Morgul-wound.  From The Fellowship of the Ring, the chapter Many Meetings:   Gandalf moved his chair to the bedside, and took a good look at Frodo.  The colour had come back to his face, and his eyes were clear, and fully awake and aware.  He was smiling, and there seemed to be little wrong with him.  But to the wizard's eye there was a faint change, just a hint as it were of transparency, about him, and especially about the left hand that lay outside upon the coverlet.  'Still that must be expected,' said Gandalf to himself.  'He is not half through yet, and to what he will come in the end not even Elrond can foretell.  Not to evil, I think.  He may become like a glass filled with clear light for eyes to see that can.'"
tolkienfans,397htj,harabanaz,4,Tue Jun 9 21:31:07 2015 UTC,"I feel like Frodo's already exceptional nature was amplified or hallowed  further by the terrible experience of the Morgul blade wound,  AND the fact that he was directly responsible for handling the supernatural evil that was the Ring."

The book says this   But the Queen Arwen said: 'A gift I will give you. For I am the daughter of Elrond.

tolkienfans,397htj,rmxz,12,Thu Jun 11 07:32:32 2015 UTC,"There are a number of reasons one might describe Frodo as ""elvish."" The most obvious being his ability to speak the language (the only other Hobbit we know who can do this is Bilbo). Beyond that, I think we can look at the context of the two quotes you gave (I could only find one other but I'll get to that below) and determine a bit more. For starters, who is it that thinks Frodo has an ""elvish air""? Faramir. As a man of Gondor, Faramir would have viewed elves as somewhat mysterious and/or noble or perhaps simply old/mature. Frodo is asking him to go back to Minas Tirith and allow him to continue on to ""where [his] doom takes [him]."" He speaks quite grimly about the quest, making it clear he believes it will end in his death, and I think it's this notion of ""more [lying] upon [their] words together than [he] thought at first"" that Faramir thinks is ""elvish."" He senses the weight of Frodo's burden and knows that Frodo is obviously not telling him everything.  As for Sam in the second quote, again lets look at how Sam views the elves. To him elves are mysteriously beautiful beings. Beings he doesn't seem to truly understand (Galadriel's comment about ""magic"" comes to mind). Frodo had gone quite pale and cold after being stung, so much so that Sam thought he was dead. Holding up the phial (which contains the light of a Silmaril), gave Frodo again some color and warmth, something that might have seemed almost magical (elvish) to Sam. The ""character's perception"" interpretation doesn't work quite as well on this one though, because the ""elvish"" descriptor isn't in a character's dialogue, but in the narrative itself.  Finally, back to that third instance of Frodo being described as elvish. Here Sam is referencing Faramir's earlier comment:   'Ah well, sir,' said Sam, 'you said my master had an elvish air and that was good and true. But I can say this: you have an air too, sir, that reminds me of, of - well, Gandalf, of wizards.'  'Maybe,' said Faramir. 'Maybe you discern from far away the air of Numenor. Good night!'   I think this might be telling as well. Of course Faramir isn't a wizard, but it's Sam's way of acknowledging a certain distinctive quality about Faramir that he can think of no other way to describe (similar to Faramir's use of ""elvish"").  I think you hit the nail on the head in your post when you asked if it had to do with Frodo's ""noble nature."" In LotR elves aren't the imperfect, often fallible beings we see in The Silmarillion. They are more stoic, noble and serene. I think it's this sense of humble bravery and serene beauty that makes Frodo noble and ""elvish."" Thoughts?"
tolkienfans,397htj,rmxz,3,Tue Jun 9 21:34:20 2015 UTC,"Bilbo    It's very strongly suggested Bilbo was through his Took ancestors.   For some direct quotes (from The Hobbit):    ""It is often said (in other families) that long ago one of the Took ancestors must have taken a fairy wife."" ""Then something Tookish woke up inside him, and he wished to ... wear a sword instead of a walking-stick."" ""On all this Bilbo looked with misery.  He had taken his stand on Ravenhill among the Elves -- partly because there was more chance of escape form that point, and partly (with the more Tookish part of his mind) because if he was going to be in a last desperate stand, he preferred on the whole to defend the Elvenking.""    And if you doubt ""fairy wife"" is talking about elves, there are other quotes that connect the concepts of elves and fairies (""The feasting people were Wood-elves ..  They differed from the High Elves of the West, and ere more dangerous and less wise ... descended from the ancient tribes that never went to Faerie in the West"").   And the Old Took's long life also points in that direction.  TL/DR: The Hobbit pretty much explicitly states strongly suggests that Tooks had Elf ancestors."
tolkienfans,397htj,Count_Spockula,3,Wed Jun 10 17:09:28 2015 UTC,"TL/DR: The Hobbit pretty much explicitly states that Tooks had Elf ancestors.   Actually. Tolkien explicitly states that this was not true.    It was often said (in other families) that long ago one of the Took ancestors must have taken a fairy wife. That was, of course, absurd, but certainly there was still something not entirely hobbit-like about them, - and once in a while members of the Took-clan would go and have adventures.   Also, Frodo was the result of a Baggins and a Brandybuck, not a Baggins and a Took like Bilbo."

tolkienfans,398oid,TemporalOasis,8,Wed Jun 10 18:58:38 2015 UTC,"Possibly.    The fact is that being a Ring Bearer for any extended period of time is a harrowing experience on a preternatural level....being faced with a psychological barrage from a completely malevolent and terribly powerful item (and being).    The damage it did to Frodo was unhealable in the conventional world, and necessitated him being offered the trip-to heal- in Valinor for the rest of his natural life.  He basically needed this, and it was absolutely owed to him for what he went willingly went through.  I bet that if another mortal had to handle the ring for that extended period of time- and probably more importantly, on a quest that would unleash the full power of the Ring on the bearer- they would likely be offered a similar ""reward"".  Again, though, it seems almost more just payment than reward, given the awful nature of what being a willing, benevolent-intentioned Ring Bearer really means."
tolkienfans,398c7a,Malchim,4,Wed Jun 10 00:00:39 2015 UTC,"But Olórin declared that he was too weak for such a task, and that he feared Sauron. Then Manwë said that that was all the more reason why he should go, and that he commanded Olórin (illegible words follow that seems to contain word ""third"").   I think it was mandatory for Gandalf and not so for the others.  They were summoned, and two others volunteered before Gandalf was commanded:   Of major interest, however, is a brief and very hasty sketch of a narrative, telling of a council of the Valar, summoned it seems by Manwë (""and maybe he called upon Eru for counsel?""), at which it was resolved to send out three emissaries to Middle-earth.   and later   But two only came forward: Curumo, who was chosen by Aulë, and Alatar, who was sent by Oromë.

Still, I can't see the Valar allowing the Istari to return with their mission unfulfilled. Perhaps any ship Saruman would try to sail on would never make it onto the Straight Path?"

tolkienfans,392oss,Vulcan-Hobbit,21,Mon Jun 8 20:38:52 2015 UTC,"It's a wonderful book, filled with well-researched cartography. Obviously some things are educated guesses, but most of it is very accurate. Fonstad even made maps of characters' journeys and travels.  It's definitely the best source for maps of Middle-earth as you're liable to get."
tolkienfans,392oss,rexbarbarorum,13,Mon Jun 8 21:08:50 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. Got it a few years back and it's well worth it. She does a good job of her research and it's well cited. Of course it's not perfect given the lack of information on certain topics. I'm sure there are errors, and I know there is some speculation on her part, but overall the author does a good job of making educated guesses where the source material falls short. In addition to geographic maps and maps of various battles and journeys, it's got a few interesting thematic maps (climate, vegetation, population, languages). If you like the cartography of Middle-Earth I recommend it.  Edit: Here's the Table of Contents in case you're curious just what's covered in it."
tolkienfans,392oss,EyeceEyeceBaby,11,Mon Jun 8 21:15:36 2015 UTC,Yes. It is hugely helpful for the Silmarillion especially. I got a lot more out of the Silmarillion after getting the atlas.
tolkienfans,392oss,acheron--,3,Mon Jun 8 23:00:32 2015 UTC,It was one of the reasons I read the Silmarillion in the first place. I saw all those maps and battles and I just had to see what it was all about!

tolkienfans,392oss,knight_of_gondor99,4,Tue Jun 9 00:20:39 2015 UTC,Very well researched. It even shows the geography of some battles.

tolkienfans,392oss,Seafroggys,1 point,Tue Jun 9 11:09:12 2015 UTC,"Yes.  I freaking love maps, so when I first saw this 15 years ago, I had to snatch it up."
tolkienfans,392oss,wjbc,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:57:05 2015 UTC,"I have one big problem with the Atlas.  It locates Valinor on the equator, far to the south of the Shire.  While there is some support for that in HoME, in LotR it is clearly stated that Valinor is to the West, not the South.  Some educational guesses had to be made when there was contradictory information, but in this case I think LotR should trump HoME.  That being said, there's plenty of other fun stuff in the Atlas.  But much of it is speculative, even if it is well researched."
tolkienfans,391ovh,Prince-Cola,11,Mon Jun 8 16:38:19 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend reading Unfinished Tales first. It contains the same type of content as HoME (JRR Tolkien's original unedited writings annotated by Christopher Tolkien), but rather than focusing on one particular time period or subject in Tolkien's writings it's a more varied selection of the writings more directly relevant to LotR and the published Silmarillion. There's more information about Numenor, the Wizards, the Palantiri, the ""Wild Men"" that show up briefly in RotK to help Theoden, and lots of other stuff. If you find you like UT, consider reading HoME as well, especially the later ones (volumes 10-12)."
tolkienfans,391ovh,PersonUsingAComputer,11,Mon Jun 8 17:09:58 2015 UTC,"For a more specifics you'll want to check out /u/Ebneter's excellent reading list.  But generally it contains at early drafts of various works and other essays written on various subjects (like ""Laws and Customs Among the Eldar"") by JRR with commentary (sometimes quite a lot of it) by his son Christopher."
tolkienfans,391ovh,italia06823834,8,Mon Jun 8 16:43:26 2015 UTC,"It's not really required reading (though some are highly recommended), and can be read in a variety of orders, depending on what you're interested in.  Basically, it's just a compilation of early drafts that would become the Silmarillion and LotR, along with scholarly commentary by Christopher. If you're interested in seeing how Tolkien's ideas and stories developed over time, the series is something you'll love.  But it's probably not something you'll just want to sit down and read, like a novel. I generally use it as reference material (though I do eventually want to read it all the way through).  Some highlights - ""Athrabeth Finrod ah Andreth"", a short dialog found in Morgoth's Ring, one of the later books in the series. Actually, all of Morgoth's Ring is worth looking at (Disclaimer: I've not yet read all of it, but it's widely considered to be one of the most useful books in the series).  The Lays of Beleriand is a collection of several of Tolkien's attempts at writing epic poetry - it includes Turin's story in alliterative verse, and the Beren and Luthien story in rhyming couplets. The whole book is a real gem that has some of Tolkien's best poetry."
tolkienfans,391ovh,rexbarbarorum,7,Mon Jun 8 17:01:26 2015 UTC,"1-5: The different versions of middle earth tolkien made from like 1910-1930. There's two epic poems, like five different versions of the silmarillion, and the beginning to an unfinished book called the lost road about time travel.  6-9: Assembled drafts of lord of the rings  10-12: Different essays about middle earth"
tolkienfans,391ovh,Nichase,3,Mon Jun 8 19:29:15 2015 UTC,"You'll find a number of different content in these books. Some will detail changes in the progression of drafts , particularly related to the silmarillion, some will talk about christophers opinion on the resolution or lack thereof of inconsistencies in middle earth cannon, and some will elaborate on stories that were only mentioned in passing in the silmarillion and lord of the rings (I really enjoyed the tale of Tuor's journey to Gondolin in Unfinished Tales (I think))."
tolkienfans,391ovh,FelagundForKing,2,Tue Jun 9 00:12:45 2015 UTC,"So, the Silmarillion was never written out by Tolkien, it was compiled by his son Christopher in as faithful a way as he could manage to his fathers vision.  That being said, its still wasn't a 'primary source' so to speak.  That is to say it wasn't the source notes, it was a cleaned up and coherent single telling of a story that Tolkien changed and added to and tweaked throughout his life.  The History of Middle e Earth is essentially those raw notes.  They read much less like a novel, and much more annotated literary commentary."
tolkienfans,391ovh,joerobo,3,Tue Jun 9 03:28:31 2015 UTC,"the Silmarillion was never written out by Tolkien,   Sure it was. Several times, in fact! :-)"
tolkienfans,391ovh,ebneter,1 point,Tue Jun 9 05:23:26 2015 UTC,"Thats not correct.  If you are referring to the chapters within the published book regarding the Silmarills, that is not wrong; however the version that includes everything that was published was compiled by Christopher after his death."
tolkienfans,391ovh,joerobo,2,Tue Jun 9 09:36:15 2015 UTC,"...  That was a joke, hence the ;-)"
tolkienfans,391ovh,ebneter,2,Tue Jun 9 21:17:45 2015 UTC,"Lol, my bad.  We may or may not take ourselves a bit to seriously around here..."
tolkienfans,391ovh,joerobo,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:14:14 2015 UTC,"I think was u/joerobo meant was that it was not written in its final form. It was like Christopher had to ""extrapolate"" -- based on his study of his father's method -- what the final form would be likely to look like. He used several of the ""silmarillion"" versions as source material..."
tolkienfans,392b6e,NebraskaLife,43,Mon Jun 8 19:08:28 2015 UTC,"Smaug says it himself:   ""I thought so last night,"" he smiled to himself. ""Lake-men, some nasty scheme of those miserable tub-trading Lake-men, or I'm a lizard. I havenít been down that way for an age and an age; but I will soon alter that""   So he clearly states he visited the Lake (few decades earlier) personally, so knows there is a town there. There was always a town on the Long Lake (Esgaroth, along the shores) prior and during the exisitance of Dale.   And Smaug laughed aloud. He had a wicked and a wily heart, and he knew his guesses were not far out, though he suspected that the Lake-men were at the back of the plans, and that most of the plunder was meant to stop there in the town by the shore that in his young days had been called Esgaroth.   Remember that dragons are incredibly intelligent, and can get plenty of extra information through their riddles and conversation too. He deduced quite a lot from the quick chat with Bilbo. Smaug lived under the mountain for several whole generations and was not sleeping the whole time - so likely took a peek out the front door on occasions. He could've even raided Esgaroth more than once after Erebor fell. 170+years passed between Girion and Bard, for example"
tolkienfans,392b6e,Mycd,9,Mon Jun 8 19:51:42 2015 UTC,Thankyou for giving a very legitimate and decent answer my friends and I appreciate it!
tolkienfans,392b6e,DeCoder68W,10,Tue Jun 9 00:37:18 2015 UTC,"I don't recall exactly if it is mentioned, but I had assumed it that Smaug didn't destroy Dale and then pass out for 50 years. He was awake and active for periods and asleep for periods. The Hobbit group found him asleep, but he wasn't asleep the whole time.  He also didn't destroy every city every time he was awake, that's just bad business for increasing his dragon hoard."
tolkienfans,392b6e,Mycd,8,Mon Jun 8 19:41:08 2015 UTC,more like 170 years actually. Smaug took over Erebor in TA2770 and Lake town was destroyed in TA2941
tolkienfans,392b6e,xXxcock_and_ballsxXx,5,Mon Jun 8 20:47:07 2015 UTC,"Smaug didn't destroy Dale and then pass out for 50 years.   He might have, Smaug and his mates in Dale guy got pretty blazed ...  I'll show myself out"

I've always assumed it lacks the blessing of the Tolkien Estate, but it's been in OC long enough that I figure the Estate decided not to bother. They do have a gift shop with officially licensed merchandise, so maybe they do have an OK.  Regardless, it always felt to me like a tasteful appreciation of Tolkien, rather than something exploitative.  EDIT: my favorite coffee mug is from there"
tolkienfans,38xrdj,MikeOfThePalace,3,Sun Jun 7 19:41:18 2015 UTC,The Estate doesn't care about this sort of thing. Middle-earth Enterprises has sued occasionally for such things but since they've universally gotten really bad publicity as a result they may have decided to stop.
tolkienfans,38xrdj,ebneter,13,Mon Jun 8 04:34:42 2015 UTC,Houston has a restaurant named The Hobbit Cafe (used to be The Hobbit Hole). Good food and lots of it. Most of the menu items are named after LOTR characters and the place is decked out in memorabilia. Awesome place to eat at!

I only lived in Houston briefly back in 2005, but my girlfriend and I came here all the time. I'm glad it's still around.   Houston has some really kick-ass restaurants, very underrated food city.

I don't think I'd like that. Sounds like a shameless and half-hearted cash-grab, by using a popular brand."
tolkienfans,38xrdj,Aylesbury,6,Sun Jun 7 20:52:05 2015 UTC,"Lol don't think so, the restaurant is almost 40 years old. Doubt their crystal ball could foresee what happened 30 years after it opened."
tolkienfans,38xrdj,Aylesbury,5,Sun Jun 7 21:05:53 2015 UTC,"Didn't know that, but it still seems half-hearted. I found some pictures on Yelp and it does look more like a very modern and fashionable higher-mid range restaurant, rather than something inspired by Hobbits. It just doesn't fit the name, which is a bit of a shame."
tolkienfans,38xrdj,VampirePirateNinja,1 point,Sun Jun 7 21:15:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah I can understand that, it's definitely higher end in menu and appearance since they opened this newest location.

tolkienfans,38xrdj,CeruleanRuin,2,Sun Jun 7 21:20:48 2015 UTC,"The restaurant as a company is 40 years old.  This is their 3rd location.  Had to double check the history, bc I remember the Rivendell Condos being built and I'm only 25!  It sounds like it was originally more rustic and quaint, though.  In any case, it makes me really miss OC.  I moved to TX 3 years ago and haven't had the chance to go back.  I used to go almost every summer."

tolkienfans,38xrdj,HannasAnarion,4,Sun Jun 7 21:15:02 2015 UTC,"Nothing even remotely hobbit-themed on it.  If I had gone there for the name I would be immediately disappointed upon seeing that pretty generic menu.   Maybe the food's good, or maybe it's the only ""fancy"" restaurant in town so it stays open because of that, but it's clear the chef and owners aren't very creative or willing to take risks."

tolkienfans,38vz2j,SteveBuscemisCunt,7,Sun Jun 7 08:01:12 2015 UTC,"I'm almost done with the same journey!  I purposefully imagined the characters as different than the movies, trying to re-create my impressions from the first time through.  It works out that FotR ""helps"" you forget the movies: once the hobbits get on the road, there's several events that aren't in the movies at all, so you're forced to stretch your imagination instead of relying on the movies.  I ended up enjoying the 2nd half of TT way more than I remember, and somewhat disliked the 1st half of RotK more.  Very rewarding overall -- there's so many ""nooks and crannies"" in the books that will reward you in a re-read."
tolkienfans,38vz2j,zakktravis,3,Sun Jun 7 13:17:15 2015 UTC,"In my opinion the books get better with re-reading. There is a lot of foreshadowing in the book that you probably won't understand on the first read. Also, re-reading LotR again after Silmarillion also puts things in a different perspective. And of course there is now also The Children of Húrin, hadn't been published yet 10 years ago."

While all the Valar are named, most of the Maiar, more numerous, are not.  Eg. Ulmo had Ossë and Uinen among his followers.  Sauron was one of Aulë's folk, until he defected to Melkor.  I suppose, without solidly knowing, that ""Oromë's people"" means (at least in part) his followers and servants among the Maiar.  The Ainur were created by Ilúvatar before the physical world was made.  The Valar and the Maiar were those among them who entered the World.  The Eruhíni (Elves and Men, and the Dwarves by adoption) were created within the World.  It would seem that other peoples were also created: neither Ainur nor Eruhíni.  Ents?  Manwë's eagles?  Huan?

Then sudden Felagund there swaying  Sang in answer a song of staying,  Resisting, battling against power,  Of secrets kept, strength like a tower,  And trust unbroken, freedom, escape;  Of changing and of shifting shape  Of snares eluded, broken traps,  The prison opening, the chain that snaps.  Backwards and forwards swayed their song.   Reeling and foundering, as ever more strong  The chanting swelled, Felagund fought,  And all the magic and might he brought  Of Elvenesse into his words.

In the spring it bore golden blossom in clusters like a cherry, which bloomed on during the summer; and as soon as the flowers opened the leaves fell, so that through spring and summer a grove of malinorni was carpeted and roofed with gold, but its pillars were of grey silver.

The reason why is because when Tolkien describes pipe-weed in his notes, he suggests it was of the Nicotiana genus (though the movie seems to strongly imply it belongs to the Cannabis genus). He also specifically calls Telpirion a ""silver cherry"", and since he drew mallorns to look cherry-like and said they resembled the Two Trees I think he was looking at a fictional species from a real genus - namely, the Prunus genus.

It does a great job of encapsulating the whole ""lost glory of the Elder Days"" theme that Tolkien's writings are full of:  The world was young, the mountains green, No stain yet on the Moon was seen, No words were laid on stream or stone When Durin woke and walked alone. He named the nameless hills and dells; He drank from yet untasted wells; He stooped and looked in Mirrormere, And saw a crown of stars appear, As gems upon a silver thread, Above the shadow of his head.  The world was fair, the mountains tall, In Elder Days before the fall Of mighty kings in Nargothrond And Gondolin, who now beyond The Western Seas have passed away: The world was fair in Durin's Day.    A king he was on carven throne In many-pillared halls of stone With golden roof and silver floor, And runes of power upon the door. The light of sun and star and moon In shining lamps of crystal hewn Undimmed by cloud or shade of night There shone for ever fair and bright.    There hammer on the anvil smote, There chisel clove, and graver wrote; There forged was blade, and bound was hilt; The delver mined, the mason built. There beryl, pearl, and opal pale, And metal wrought like fishes' mail, Buckler and corslet, axe and sword, And shining spears were laid in hoard.    Unwearied then were Durin's folk Beneath the mountains music woke: The harpers harped, the minstrels sang, And at the gates the trumpets rang.    The world is grey, the mountains old, The forge's fire is ashen-cold No harp is wrung, no hammer falls: The darkness dwells in Durin's halls The shadow lies upon his tomb In Moria, in Khazad-dûm. But still the sunken stars appear In dark and windless Mirrormere; There lies his crown in water deep, Till Durin wakes again from sleep."

tolkienfans,38jx1u,SoftwareNinja,6,Fri Jun 5 16:14:11 2015 UTC,"I think it's from the ending to the Lay of Leithian. I've never seen any praise for this particular fragment but it's possibly the most beautiful piece of poetry I've ever read:  Where the forest-stream went through the wood, and silent all the stems there stood of tall trees, moveless, hanging dark with mottled shadows on their bark above the green and gleaming river, there came through leaves a sudden shiver, a windy whisper through the still cool silences; and down the hill, as faint as a deep sleeper's breath, an echo came as cold as death: 'Long are the paths, of shadow made where no foot's print is ever laid, over the hills, across the seas! Far, far away are the Lands of Ease, but the Land of the Lost is further yet, where the Dead wait, while ye forget. No moon is there, no voice, no sound of beating heart; a sigh profound once in each age as each age dies alone is heard. Far, far it lies, the Land of Waiting where the Dead sit, in their thought's shadow, by no moon lit.'  Edit: formatting"
tolkienfans,38jx1u,examors,5,Thu Jun 4 22:38:37 2015 UTC,"The lament for Gandalf in Lothlorien  When evening in the Shire was grey his footsteps on the Hill were heard;  before the dawn he went away on journey long without a word.  From Wilderland to Western shore, from northern waste to southern hill,  through dragon-lair and hidden door and darkling woods he walked at will.  With Dwarf and Hobbit, Elves and Men, with mortal and immortal folk,  with bird on bough and beast in den, in their own secret tongues he spoke.  A deadly sword, a healing hand, a back that bent beneath its load;  a trumpet-voice, a burning brand, a weary pilgrim on the road.  A lord of wisdom throned he sat, swift in anger, quick to laugh;  an old man in a battered hat who leaned upon a thorny staff.  He stood upon the bridge alone and Fire and Shadow both defied;  his staff was broken on the stone, in Khazad-dûm his wisdom died.  And Sam finale:   The finest rockets ever seen: they burst in stars of blue and green, or after thunder golden showers came falling like a rain of flowers."
tolkienfans,38jx1u,Mycd,6,Thu Jun 4 21:03:30 2015 UTC,"My favourite was always the Lament for Boromir. It's just so damn emotive!  Aragorn sang:  Through Rohan over fen and field where the long grass grows The West Wind comes walking, and about the walls it goes.  ‘What news from the West, O wandering wind, do you bring to me tonight?  Have you seen Boromir the Tall by moon or by starlight?  ‘I saw him ride over seven streams, over waters wide and grey,  I saw him walk in empty lands until he passed away  Into the shadows of the North, I saw him then no more.  The North Wind may have heard the horn of the son of Denethor,  ‘O Boromir! From the high walls westward I looked afar,  But you came not from the empty lands where no men are.’   Then Legolas sang:  From the mouths of the Sea the South Wind flies, from the sandhills and the stones,  The wailing of the gulls it bears, and at the gate it moans.  ‘What news from the South, O sighing wind, do you bring to me at eve?  Where now is Boromir the Fair? He tarries and I grieve.  ‘Ask not of me where he doth dwell – so many bones there lie,  On the white shores and the dark shores under the stormy sky,  So many have passed down Anduin to find the flowing Sea.  Ask of the North Wind news of them the North Wind sends to me!’  ‘O Boromir! Beyond the gate the seaward roads runs south,  But you came not with the wailing gulls from the grey sea’s mouth’.   Then Aragorn sang again:  From the Gate of the Kings the North Wind rides, and past the roaring falls,  And clear and cold about the tower its loud horn calls.  ‘What news from the North, O mighty wind, do you bring to me today?  What news of Boromir the bold? For he is long away.’  ‘Beneath Amon Hen I heard his cry. There many foes he fought,  His cloven shield, his broken sword, they to the water brought.  His head so proud, his face so fair, his limbs they laid to rest,  And Rauros, golden Rauros-falls, bore him upon its breast.  ‘O Boromir! The Tower of Guard shall ever northward gaze,  To Rauros, golden Rauros-falls, until the end of days."

Sing and rejoice, ye people of the Tower of Guard, for your watch hath not been in vain, and the Black Gate is broken, and your King hath passed through, and he is victorious.

The Noldor had more of a builder/creator mentality than the other Elves, somewhat similar to the Dwarves.  Some Dwarves killed what is likely the most important Sindar king, Thingol. Thranduil and his son Legolas are Sindar and likely know this, though most of the Dwarves of Erebor were of a different ""tribe"" of Dwarves.

It was first conceived in a small woodland glade filled with hemlocks at Roos in Yorkshire (where I was for a brief time in command of an outpost of the Humber Garrison in 1917, and she was able to live with me for a while). In those days her hair was raven, her skin clear, her eyes brighter than you have seen them, and she could sing – and dance.

tolkienfans,38fqvb,greenleaf547,2,Thu Jun 4 14:47:38 2015 UTC,"ah - gocha it is beautiful, but i have a slight problem with how it's used in the film.  It describes Frodo's experience as he passes into the West - the white shores are the shores of Valinor, aren't they? The conventional view is that Hobbits branched off from men in the early days, and so share the fate of men (they pass out of the world at death, the die-proper).  So if Pippin dies in battle he's gone further than the Valar know.  Not wanting to put a downer on it tho [smiles unconvincingly]"
tolkienfans,38fqvb,uisge-beatha,5,Thu Jun 4 20:24:46 2015 UTC,"Two interesting takes on how that scene still works.  The first is that-while we know that mortals eventually leave the world outright-mortals' spirits apparently may spend some time in waiting in the Halls of Mandos.  Given the location, it may very well be that upon death a mortal passes ethereally on the Straight Road to that very location, and thus could indeed experience that same vision. The second is that given Gandalf's nature as a non-mortal who knows that some extraordinary fate awaits Men, he's presenting to Pippin the closest approximation that he can give in the form of a vision of the Blessed Realm.   With the intent being to give Pippin hope, and not at all a dubious hope.  And actually, in this scenario (and this is my head canon, given his focus on hope and utter trust in Eru ) Gandalf may rightly suspect that this pales in comparison to the beautific and beyond sublime experience that awaits mortals upon receipt of the Gift."

But Saruman had slowly shaped it to his shifting purposes, and made it better, as he thought, being deceived – for all those arts and subtle devices, for which he forsook his former wisdom, and which fondly he imagined were his own, came but from Mordor; so that what he made was naught, only a little copy, a child's model or a slave's flattery, of that vast fortress. Armoury, prison, furnace of great power, Barad-dur, the Dark Tower, which suffered no rival, and laughed at flattery, biding its time, secure in its pride and its immeasurable strength.""   Incredible description of the absolute power held by Mordor.

But this letter has always been haunting to me, since I first read it. This is written by one of JRRT's best friends, Geoffrey Smith. So, not quite a tolkien quote, but I think it is deeply intrenched in all of Tolkien's work. Smith was in a secret group (Tea Club Barrovian Society or TCBS) with tolkien and 2 other's who were all best friends in College. During the Great War, all 4 were shipped out to the battle. Out of those 4, only Tolkien and Christopher Wiseman came back. The group would write and read eachothers works. It was partially this survivor's guilt that drove Tolkien to become so immersed in writing his mythology. This letter, the last written by Smith, must have struck deep.   My chief consolation is that if I am scuppered tonight -- I am off on duty in a few minutes -- there will still be left a member of the great T.C.B.S. to voice what I dreamed and what we all agreed upon. For the death of one of its members cannot, I am determined, dissolve the T.C.B.S. Death can make us loathsome and helpless as individuals, but it cannot put an end to the immortal four!

Barad Nimras was one of these towers ""...to watch the western sea, though needlessly, as it proved; for at no time ever did Morgoth essay to build ships or to make war by sea. Water all his servants shunned, and to the sea none would willingly go nigh, save in dire need. ""  I have a hard time believing that Sauron has water-based servants if Morgoth/Melkor can barely convince one of his servants to even enter water.  Sauron's chief servants; the Nazgul, hate water.  Though the Watcher in the Water is never directly tied to Sauron I'll grant it because Gandalf does remark that it reached for Frodo first. So Dark Things could definitely be drawn to the Ring if thrown into the Sea. Would those Dark Things lead it to Sauron? Who knows."

The wizard had spent years learning the lore of the Rings of power, and their making. We also know Isildur never did (or could) cause any hurt to it."

tolkienfans,38fclv,the_blackfish,7,Fri Jun 12 12:04:12 2015 UTC,"First off, I've noticed some speculation that Gandalf might have possessed that knowledge because of his study of Ring-lore and innate understanding of magic and power. However, one must remember two things: Saruman was the Istari that was by far the most well-read on such matters, and, as we know, he guarded his knowledge well because of his corruption; and, furthermore, when Isildur took the Ring from Sauron he was counselled by Elrond and Círdan to destroy it - meaning that it already has been established that such knowledge existed prior to Gandalf.  Moving on from there, there are some passages that has always made me suspect how the Elves came to know this.  From ""Of the Rings of Power"" in The Silmarillion:   ""And much of the strength and will of Sauron passed into that One Ring; for the power of the Elven-rings was very great, and that which should govern them must be a thing of surpassing potency; and Sauron forged it in the Mountain of Fire in the Land of Shadow.""   Which I've always taken to mean that besides letting his own strength and will pass into the One Ring, he needed the heat from Mount Doom to do so since he was the one who restarted the fires of the volcano.   ""As soon as Sauron set the One ring upon his finger they [the Elves] were aware of him; and they knew him, and perceived that he would be master of them, and of all that they wrought.""   And, since Sauron put on the Ring in Mount Doom and the Elves became aware of him while he is there, they presumable know of the location that he forged the Ring in as well.    ""and he came against them with open war, demanding that all the rings should be delivered to him, since the Elven-smiths could not have attained to their making without his lore and counsel.""  ""Therefore the Three remained unsullied, for they were forged by Celebrimbor alone, and the hand of Sauron had never touched them; yet they were also subject to the One.""   This makes me suspect that the Elves, besides learning how to create Rings of Power from Sauron, also learnt how to undo them. However, there is no direct evidence for that.  And, unrelated to the Rings of Power, but related to Things of Power, in ""The Palantíri"" in Unfinished Tales Tolkien writes that    ""[t]hey [the Palantíri] were indeed unbreakable by any violence then controlled by men, though some believed that great heat, such as that of Orodruin, might shatter them, and surmised that this had been the fate of the Ithil-stone in the fall of Barad-dûr.""   So there seems to be some evidence that ""Things of Power + Tremendous Heat = Broken"" was in the Zeitgeist of Middle-earth at that time, whether it be dragon-fire or volcanoes. Presumably one can conclude that since the Wise knew of no other great heat source than Mount Doom, that's where the  journey went."
tolkienfans,38fclv,thorheimdallr,2,Fri Jun 12 15:25:30 2015 UTC,"This makes me suspect that the Elves, besides learning how to create Rings of Power from Sauron, also learnt how to undo them. However, there is no direct evidence for that.   It's fairly logical to deduce that the elven smiths who forged the rings had a reasonably precise idea of how resistant they would be and what it would take to unmake them."
tolkienfans,38fclv,HJonGoldrake,3,Fri Jun 12 16:22:16 2015 UTC,"I think it's mentioned that it would have been possible to destroy the One with dragon fire, but there were none in the world that would be reachable or would even being will should they find one. I could be wrong, that's just something I thought was brought up."
tolkienfans,38fclv,PredatorsFan,5,Fri Jun 12 17:41:59 2015 UTC,"I remember that at some point it is mentioned that ""not even"" the fire of Ancalagon the Black would have been sufficient to destroy the One Ring, and he was, of course, the mightiest and biggest - and presumably fiery-est - of all dragons. However, this is a hint (though no conclusive evidence) that the ring could be unmade by fire if it were sufficiently hot, and indeed the destructive aspect of Mt. Doom is the heat of its' subterranean fire, and not some magic property about the mountain itself. This question has been discussed back and forth many times before though and others have pointed out that if this were true, then surely there would be other volcanos (or other access routes to lava) on ME that one could take the ring to, and Mt. Doom would hardly have been the most accessible of them.  There is, as far as I know, nothing conclusive in the books on this question."
tolkienfans,38fclv,Hoppetar,5,Fri Jun 12 17:43:53 2015 UTC,I'm not sure what part of that passage you consider to be a hint that it could be unmade with fire.

tolkienfans,38fclv,Xecellseor,4,Fri Jun 12 17:25:37 2015 UTC,"I mean, he was the mightiest. And it's not unreasonable to suppose he was the biggest (unprovable though). It's the order of magnitude stuff that's absurd and earns a frown."
tolkienfans,38fclv,Uluithiad,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:40:50 2015 UTC,"I'm not so sure whether there would be other (more accessible) accesses to lava. In the whole history of ME, there are only two volcanic regions mentioned; both created by great evil spirits. Morgoth raised the three vulcanic peaks of Thangorodrim,  and in the books it is clearly stated that Mt. Doom is only active when Sauron is present and brooding evil.  So expanding this to the whole world of ME: lava/volcanos are not as common as in our world (being created by earth-movement) but rather are created or activated by mighty evil spirits. Therefore there won't be many other accessible places to lava, since there is only one Dark Lord left in the third age and he activated the one vulcano. Thus Mt. Doom is indeed the only place where they could get acces to lava.   I think that this also  gives an idea why only lava is hot enough to destroy the ring: the lava excist because of Sauron en therefore it has an existential link with Sauron and his powers. Since the One Ring could only be unmade by someone of the same or higher craftsmanship as Sauron, lava would count as 'his own craft' (very bluntly spoken) and would be able to destroy it. Dragonfire could maybe be hot enough to destroy the ring since they were created by Morgoth in Thangorodrim. And I also like to think Feänor could unmake the ring being the greatest smith ever (greater than Sauron) - but then again would not be able to resist the lure of the ring. So he could but would not be able to destroy the ring."
tolkienfans,38fclv,cats_are_pussies,7,Fri Jun 12 18:00:13 2015 UTC,I assume Sauron made a user manual and someone got a look at it and that's how they knew.
tolkienfans,38fclv,bmystry,5,Fri Jun 12 18:37:54 2015 UTC,"My guess would be that it was forged there, so it had to be hot enough to melt the gold(? or whatever the material was) initially.  Whether or not the enchantment made it harder to destroy, or if it was simply the material, I do not know."

tolkienfans,38fclv,HJonGoldrake,2,Fri Jun 12 19:03:36 2015 UTC,"You've got several replies which kind of touch upon the right answer but don't quite pinpoint it. I'll try my best to fill in the gaps:   How did it become known that the One Ring could only be destroyed in the fires of Mount Doom?   By deduction. Gandalf and Elrond knew that the One Ring could control the Three and, thus, that it must have been incredibly potent; they also knew that to produce such an object, Sauron would have been forced to pour much of his native strength into it, a native strength which was provably enormous given Sauron's incredible past achievements. They knew that the Great Rings were extremely hard to damage; dragonfire was required to destroy some of the Seven, which were less powerful than the Three, which were much less powerful than the One. Finally, they knew that one force, one magical location was employed in the forging of the One and thus provably capable of affecting its substance: the fires of Sammath Naur.  From these chains of reasoning, they concluded that no force available on Middle Earth in the Third Age, except the fires of Sammath Naur, could have unmade the One Ring.   They did know that the other Rings of Power could have been destroyed by dragon fire (how they knew that is a question on its own) but how did they know that the One couldn't have been if it was never tested?   They knew that the Seven could be destroyed by dragonfire because it actually happened. They didn't know whether the Nine or the Three could be similarly destroyed, given that they had no direct knowledge of ring-lore; Gandalf says ""it is said"" about it, but that's it."
tolkienfans,38fclv,HJonGoldrake,5,Wed Jun 3 21:48:39 2015 UTC,"It was because that's where Sauron crafted it. What can craft a thing can destroy it too.   Sauron returned to Mordor, and in his forge in Mount Doom he made the One Ring, imbuing it with a large portion of his power. Its purpose was domination over the other Rings and their powers, and the opening of the thoughts and wills of their wearers to his view and control. However, when Sauron put on the One Ring and recited the formula inscribed on it..."
tolkienfans,38fclv,vicegrip,1 point,Sat Jun 6 17:42:05 2015 UTC,"It was forged there, I think they thought the only way it could be destroyed was there as well.

tolkienfans,38gcfb,space-dolphin,9,Thu Jun 4 00:53:56 2015 UTC,"This is somewhat beside the point... but Equator is not warmer than the polar regions because it is closer to the sun. Sun is 149 500 000 km away on average. Earth's radius is around 6000 km. That is way less than even a per mil. Polar regions are colder because that angle of the light and the amount of energy per area. That of course is due to the spherical shape of the Earth, but in ancient times before the Greeks learned that the Earth is a sphere they had theories of their own to explain why climate is different the further the south they went.  Actually a better way to consider that the Earth is round in the legendarium is the part where Aragorn says that he has wondered so far south that even the stars are different."
tolkienfans,38gcfb,sakor88,5,Thu Jun 4 09:40:11 2015 UTC,"From Akallabêth in The Silmarillion, about the Dúnedain after the Fall of Númenor:   ...the great mariners among them would still search the empty seas, hoping to come upon the Isle of Meneltarma, and there to see a vision of things that were. But they found it not. And those that sailed far came only to the new lands, and found them like to the old lands, and subject to death. And those that sailed furthest set but a girdle about the Earth and returned weary at last to the place of their beginning...   So apparently in the early Third Age there were Dúnedain who sailed completely around the world. Whether such knowledge was known in later days is another question. I'd assume it was at least known by ""the wise""—Elrond, Galadriel, the wizards. And from them to anyone who cared to know and asked. Perhaps it was remembered in Gondor and, maybe more so for their maritime tradition, Umbar.  As for the weather, one thing I've noticed is the way Tolkien frequently describes warmer weather as coming from the Sea—up the Vale of Anduin at least, while colder weather comes from inland—usually from the north but sometimes from the east too. It makes me think that Tolkien was well aware of the moderating influence of the ocean and the harsher weather of continental interiors. In other words, warmth doesn't always come from the south. It can come from the ocean too. I can't remember exactly off hand, but I think there is some mention of The Shire being so temperate due in part to its relative proximity to the Sea.  edit add: The Atlas of Middle-earth has climatic maps. They are partially speculative, but Karen Fonstad wrote about them, citing various Tolkien sources. She says Tolkien frequently mentioned prevailing westerly winds, eg ""in Nevrast, in the Shire, on the Barrow-downs, in the Trollshaws, at Lonely Mountain, in Gondor..."". Based in part on this she depicts the known-lands of Middle-earth as having  ""the mild yet relatively cool Marine West Coast climate of England and North Central Europe...""  She also points out that areas where Morgoth had dominated tended to be cold. There were places that were mild but became cold when Morgoth's power increased. Even in the Second and Third Ages the coldness of the north was often attributed to Morgoth's lingering influence, and could be worsened by, for example, Angmar.  Anyway, she makes the case that in the Third Age the climate west of the Misty Mountains was generally mild and like Western Europe, while east of the mountains the winters tended to be colder and Spring slower in coming (cf the descriptions of the Brown Lands), with exceptions like Lothlorien. In short it appears that Middle-earth's weather was very much like Western Europe's: Generally warmer in the south, but with westerly winds from the ocean playing a major role."

tolkienfans,38gcfb,Uluithiad,3,Thu Jun 4 02:42:56 2015 UTC,"Frodo was saying that he expected the weather to get warmer when they moved to a more southern geographic location, rather than the time of the year.

A flat earth pointed at the sun would get the same sun everywhere, but if the sun was very small (like a Maia with a lamp) it could be that the sun would not affect temperature much.  Remember, before Morgoth destroyed the trees there was no sun, and still Middle-earth was not completely frozen. I don't think the sun is the kind of sun we have, that is 99% of the weight of the entire solar system and all other planets make up the rest. It could also be an earth-centric system, I think it says that the sun is the one that moves over Arda."

It just means that you know that it gets warmer as you go south."

tolkienfans,38gcfb,ReinierPersoon,3,Thu Jun 4 09:45:59 2015 UTC,"It's possible he just heard it was warmer south? Frodo was known to talk to travelers, Dwarves, Elves, and of course learned people like Gandalf and Bilbo (for a Hobbit at least). I think many of the Elves knew the earth was a sphere.

tolkienfans,38gcfb,ReinierPersoon,3,Thu Jun 4 04:09:53 2015 UTC,"Yes, I am aware that it being warmer at the equator in winters is an idea that works with a spherical world, that a spherical world (with certain relatively safe assumptions along with it) demands such a temperature gradient. But the reverse is absolutely not true. A latitudinal temperature gradient does not demand a spherical world, and the fact that the north was still colder in the First Age proves it."

Also for any curious here's the relevant quote by Gandalf:   'Well, you can go on looking forward,' said Gandalf. `There may be many unexpected feasts ahead for you. For myself I should like a pipe to smoke in comfort, and warmer feet. However, we are certain of one thing at any rate: it will get warmer as we get south.'   Judging by the Appendices I believe this was said sometime between January 8th and January 12th.

tolkienfans,38gcfb,ReinierPersoon,1 point,Thu Jun 4 12:21:46 2015 UTC,"Precisely my point. I interpret the passage as suggesting southern latitudes have hotter climates. There are a number of other context clues as well (descriptions of Harad for example) that point to this. It's plausible to me that Gandalf's intended meaning referred to the seasons, but this doesn't change the north-south temperature gradient that's fairly evident. Gandalf could have referred to the seasons changing and known that Arda was spherical. The two are not mutually exclusive. I was simply stating that such an interpretation isn't disproved by the dates as Squirrel_Boy_1 suggested."
tolkienfans,38gcfb,EyeceEyeceBaby,3,Thu Jun 4 12:57:45 2015 UTC,"That puzzled me, as it would suggest an understanding of Arda being spherical, with the southerly equator being nearer to the sun than the near-polar regions.   This is not how weather/seasons and the planet/earth work. It has to do with the planet's tilt and how direct/indirect the sun hits certain points on the planet."
tolkienfans,38gcfb,DividingPrescott,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:55:08 2015 UTC,"Actually Gandalf said it first, and Gandalf likely did know the earth was round:   'Well, you can go on looking forward,' said Gandalf. `There may be many unexpected feasts ahead for you. For myself I should like a pipe to smoke in comfort, and warmer feet. However, we are certain of one thing at any rate: it will get warmer as we get south.' - The Ring Goes South   There is a quote much later as the company travels south on the Anduin by Frodo though:   'How wide and empty and mournful all this country looks!' said Frodo. 'I always imagined that as one journeyed south it got warmer and merrier, until winter was left behind for ever.' - The Great River   As you can see he doesn't seem to be certain of it at all. He merely 'imagines' it gets warmer. The focus of the sentence isn't really even on the temperature but on his dismay and surprise at how dreary the surrounding country looked. Also we know he's heard Gandalf indicate that southern areas tend to be warmer so it's possible he got this notion from him.  Edit: Formatting"

What I think (I'm not certain) is that climate isn't really affected by being a sphere. The notion of a cold north, implying a warmer south, was already there when Arda was flat. Even before the sun was created and Middle-earth was in darkness, nowhere is it said that everything was frozen. I don't think Gandalf or anyone else saying the south is warm, has anything to do with Arda being a sphere. Gandalf probably knew Arda was a sphere since he traveled the straight road from Valinor, but his comment about a warm south does not prove anything in my opinion, except that he knew the south was warmer.  So yes, the south is warmer and Arda is a sphere now, but the has always been warmer. Both are true but we don't know whether they are related."

For the most part I agree with you (that Gandalf's statement implying southern warmth isn't necessarily connected to a spherical Arda), I just want to point out two things:   A frigid northern region was certainly always a part of Arda, but I don't think we can assume this implies a warmer south. So little is known about the south of Arda; perhaps the extreme south is cold as well. All we know is that later on, during the Third Age (and very likely earlier) the middle latitudes were generally warmer. Middle latitudes, not southern. Just eyeballing this map puts Gondor/Mordor around 30°N-40°N and Harad around 15°N-30°N. It's okay to inform our interpretation of Arda during the Third Age with our Earth today. Tolkien intended them to be one and the same, going so far as to comment that he believed the Fall of Barad-Dur occurred around 6000 years prior to the present (or more accurately, 1958). In that light, knowing what we know about the climatic effects of a planet rotating about a tilted axis, revolving around a star, we can look at the parallels between the Third Age and now and interpret accordingly.   We're now well beyond what Gandalf or Frodo did or did not know though. As I said, per Gandalf's knowledge, I'm in agreement with you. I'm sure he knew Arda was a sphere at that point, and that the climate was warmer to the south of his current location (Hollin), but this could simply be because he'd been there before! He doesn't need knowledge of the implications of a spherical planet with a tilted axis orbiting a star to determine that, he can just go there and find out!"
tolkienfans,38gcfb,EyeceEyeceBaby,1 point,Thu Jun 4 13:47:33 2015 UTC,"You have to remember that its not like our earth.  Just because its spherical doesn't mean its on an axis and that is why there are seasons.  After all, as far as we know the sun and moon (last remaining fruits of the trees) are still transported by the Maiar across the sky, rather than us revolving around a giant ball of gas."
tolkienfans,38gcfb,AmbiguousAnonymous,2,Thu Jun 4 12:45:11 2015 UTC,"Actually, it is our earth. Tolkien wrote his entire legendarium within the context of it being a mythological history for our world. He even went so far as to state that he believes it's been about 6000 years (this quote is from 1958) since the Fall of Barad-Dur. It's left unclear when exactly the larger universe changed to what we observe scientifically now. Perhaps it did occur during the Changing of the World, in which case the Arda Frodo knew was rotating about a tilted axis, orbiting a giant ball of gas."

I see your point, and that it is possible that those changes already occurred, but personally I think it must have happened later, after all the elves left for good and other notably fantastic things waned.

From what I can find, the band word element implies both prison/custody and duress and ""hell"" is used as a translator's conceit to evoke how bad the place was based on the reader's preexisting notions.  Another thing to note: in the earliest version of the stories (The Book of Lost Tales for example), Melko's fortress literally was a possible destination of men's souls after death and it's possible that the idea/translation was a carryover from that time period.

During the War of the Ring, the Enemy was (relatively) more dangerous than ever. He needed to be dealt with, and anyone with the Ring and the stature to use it against him would, before long, be tempted. Why would Galadriel assume she would fall prey to the Ring, when Isildur didn't? Because the conditions were vastly different.  Another point is that the ambition is always there (apart from certain philosophically pure beings). Bilbo and Frodo, and Hobbits in general, were not as inclined to domination as others, but the very fact that there was some sort of governance in the Shire, however little, means there was some of that ambition."

At that point, it's not Galadriel who happens to possess the Ring. It's Galadriel who has already been warped into a despot, pressed her will onto others in order to get them to do what she wants, to sacrifice them for her agenda.

If  any  of  the  Wise should with this Ring overthrow the Lord of Mordor, using his own arts, he would then set himself on Sauron’s throne, and yet another Dark Lord would appear.""  However, it isn't an automatic response, different people react differently to it:  ‘I would ask one thing before we go,’ said Frodo, ‘a thing which I often meant to ask Gandalf in Rivendell. I am per- mitted to wear the One Ring: why cannot I see all the others and know the thoughts of those that wear them?’ ‘You have not tried,’ she said. ‘Only thrice have you set the  Ring  upon  your  finger  since  you  knew  what  you  possessed. Do not try! It would destroy you. Did not Gandalf tell you that the rings give power according to the measure of  each  possessor?  Before  you  could  use  that  power  you would need to become far stronger, and to train your will to the domination of others.'

Galadriel is a different story, as are the wizards and other high elves.  They possess the inherent power to wield the ring as a tool of power, even if eventually they too would be corrupted by it in their own fashion.

Feanor was the eldest son of a king, and some amount of power was his legit birthright. Morgoth led Feanor to think his rightful power was threatened. His actions before Morgoth took the Silmarils had their root in trying to protect what was rightfully his. That's not ""seizing"" power for the sake of power alone.  After Morgoth took the Silmarils, Feanor's actions were all based on getting those back. For all the wrong he did, none of it was for personal ""power"" or ""glory"". He just wanted his stuff back.

tolkienfans,387qgj,HollowImage,38,Tue Jun 2 16:02:27 2015 UTC,"The premise of your question is a bit off, given the fact that no one can willingly destroy the Ring. It took a little push from Eru to ultimately destroy it. But let's put that aside for the sake of your question:   ""But there is no smith’s forge in this Shire that could change it at all. Not even the anvils and furnaces of the Dwarves could do that. It has been said that dragon-fire could melt and consume the Rings of Power, but there is not now any dragon left on earth in which the old fire is hot enough; nor was there ever any dragon, not even Ancalagon the Black, who could have harmed the One Ring, the Ruling Ring, for that was made by Sauron himself. There is only one way: to find the Cracks of Doom in the depths of Orodruin, the Fire-mountain, and cast the Ring in there, if you really wish to destroy it, to put it beyond the grasp of the Enemy for ever."" - The Fellowship of the Ring   Gandalf pretty clearly states that the only way to destroy it is in Orodruin. So no, as far as I can tell Fëanor could not have destroyed the One Ring. (Good question though!)"
tolkienfans,387qgj,EyeceEyeceBaby,57,Tue Jun 2 13:46:48 2015 UTC,"The question I think is probably inspired by this bit from letter 131:  ""There was another weakness: if the One Ring was actually unmade, annihilated, then its power would be dissolved, Sauron's own being would be diminished to vanishing point, and he would be reduced to a shadow, a mere memory of malicious will. But that he never contemplated nor feared. The Ring was unbreakable by any smithcraft less than his own. It was indissoluble in any fire, save the undying subterranean fire where it was made – and that was unapproachable, in Mordor. Also so great was the Ring's power of lust, that anyone who used it became mastered by it; it was beyond the strength of any will (even his own) to injure it, cast it away, or neglect it. So he thought. It was in any case on his finger."" (emphasis mine)  This seems to leave open the possibility of smithcraft greater than Sauron's being able to break the Ring (although being unbrekable by lesser smithcraft is not entirely the same thing as being breakable by greater). However, this would have to be craft, not simple heat, because it's explicitly stated that only Orodruin can melt it."
tolkienfans,387qgj,fearsomeduckins,13,Tue Jun 2 14:11:19 2015 UTC,"Ah yes this gives OP's question a bit more context, but to me it's still not clear that Fëanor's smithcraft would have been great enough. It wasn't just Sauron's skill as a smith that created the ring, it was his might of will and spirit. I imagine there's some quote from The Silmarillion indicating Fëanor's skill as a craftsman might have matched or surpassed an Ainu? (Don't have time to go looking for one myself right now) If not, then I think as you said, the letter might leave open the possibility of smithcraft greater than Sauron's, but we don't have any indication of who might be a craftsman greater (save Aulë of course)."
tolkienfans,387qgj,EyeceEyeceBaby,38,Tue Jun 2 15:17:22 2015 UTC,"In TTT Pippin and Gandalf discuss the palantiri:   'Then it was not made, not made' - Pippin hesitated - 'by the Enemy?'  'No,' said Gandalf. 'Nor by Saruman. It is beyond his art, and beyond Sauron's too. The palantíri came from beyond Westernesse from Eldamar. The Noldor made them. Fëanor himself, maybe, wrought them, in days so long ago that the time cannot be measured in years. But there is nothing that Sauron cannot turn to evil uses. Alas for Saruman! It was his downfall, as I now perceive. Perilous to us all are the devices of an art deeper than we possess ourselves. Yet he must bear the blame. Fool! to keep it secret, for his own profit. No word did he ever speak of it to any of the Council. We had not yet given thought to the fate of the palantíri of Gondor in its ruinous wars. By Men they were almost forgotten. Even in Gondor they were a secret known only to a few; in Arnor they were remembered only in a rhyme of lore among the Dúnedain.'   The Index of Names in the Silmarillion confirms that the palantiri were made by Feanor, so it would seem that his ""art"" is beyond that of Saruman or Sauron."
tolkienfans,387qgj,PersonUsingAComputer,12,Tue Jun 2 17:10:13 2015 UTC,"Ah yes this is a perfect example, thank you. I knew Fëanor made the palantiri, but had forgotten Gandalf's quote regarding Sauron's inability to do so. So that settles it, at least in as far as it's possible. Unfortunately to the point of OP's question, I don't there's a definitive answer given the ambiguity of the line in Letter 131. It's also interesting to take a look at the line directly following the bold text by /u/fearsomeduckins:   It was indissoluble in any fire, save the undying subterranean fire where it was made   So whatever smithcraft greater than Sauron's (or Saruman's) that could unmake the Ring must not involve fire."
tolkienfans,387qgj,EyeceEyeceBaby,5,Tue Jun 2 17:44:32 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's meant to imply a true invulnerability to flames, but rather that no heat you can find or create through the crafts available will reach the level required to break the ring down. The only available known source that is hot enough is the heat of the earth under Orodruin. If Eru himself wanted to conjure a flame of such remarkable intensity that it would melt the Ring, then he could."
tolkienfans,387qgj,Satsuz,6,Tue Jun 2 18:24:31 2015 UTC,"Your example is a bit of a paradox though. Eru is an omnipotent being. Of course an omnipotent being could create fire that can destroy something impervious to fire. That's the main problem with such beings, their existence implies a great number of paradoxes. Suppose someone (human) believes in the Christian God and is a rational being. They wouldn't claim the ability to turn water into wine with the wave of a hand simply because they believe their God could endow them with such an ability. Within the rational world, they know it's impossible. Within the confines of beings of limited power (i.e. everyone besides Eru) and in limited environments (i.e. Arda), the Ring is invulnerable to flames and/or heat.  In fact, that's basically how I interpret your wording as well: no heat you can find or create through the crafts available will reach the level required to break the ring down.  Perhaps I should have qualified my statement a bit more when I said ""must not involve fire."""
tolkienfans,387qgj,EyeceEyeceBaby,8,Tue Jun 2 19:00:35 2015 UTC,"I may have gone too far ""over Sauron's head"" in my example, there. What I was essentially trying (and failing) to say is that a hot enough fire could undo Sauron's work, but it would have to be of a kind that is unavailable in Middle Earth naturally or technologically (save for Orodruin). I do not take the incredible durability of the ring to be a property of its enchantments, but of its craft.  While ""magic"" and miracles do exist in Tolkien's world, his preference in the design skews rather on the low side of high fantasy. There are many examples in his writing where it's stated that things may seem magical, but they have in fact come about from such a deep understanding of the world and how to manipulate it that they seem impossible. While this is especially true of the craft of the Elves, I believe it applies to even the Ainur. There is a reason that our villains Sauron and Saruman were spirits of crafting and the earth, under Aule."
tolkienfans,387qgj,Satsuz,4,Tue Jun 2 19:19:09 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, it is an important distinction to make regarding Tolkien and ""magic."" To simply say fire and heat can't harm it (except Orodruin) does leave out the reason why, which is pretty important to a discussion that hinges on who's the better craftsman!"
tolkienfans,387qgj,EyeceEyeceBaby,11,Tue Jun 2 20:28:30 2015 UTC,"Yea, to me it's also inconclusive. In the first place is the question of whether greater smithcraft could break the Ring; technically Tolkien only says lesser smithcraft can't. It could be that lesser smithcraft and greater smithcraft both can't, or that all lesser and a given portion of greater can't. And then of course is the question of how we judge greater. I would imagine that ""breaking Rings of Power"" would be a very specialized subset of smithing knowledge, and simply having a higher average smithing skill than Sauron across all disciplines wouldn't magically make someone able to break the Ring; we're not talking about an RPG, where if you level your smithing up to 95 all of a sudden you get the ""break rings of power"" trait. Fëanor makes the silmarils, which no one else was able to do, but that doesn't mean he knows enough about rings of power to break one, particularly the Ruling Ring. Personally I doubt that he would have the... strength of being, I guess, to break the Ring, even if he had the knowledge. The lesser rings, sure, but not Sauron's own. Aulë could probably do it, though."
tolkienfans,387qgj,fearsomeduckins,15,Tue Jun 2 15:29:40 2015 UTC,"Is this a case where we need to take into consideration the matter of perspective, i.e., who is making the claim?   In the first case, in the FotR, Gandalf (a being of not unlimited knowledge) is making the claim that ""There is only one way: to find the Cracks of Doom in the depths of Orodruin, the Fire-mountain, and cast the Ring in there, if you really wish to destroy it, to put it beyond the grasp of the Enemy for ever."" Let's also not forget, he is speaking to a particular audience for a particular effect, which is something he is known to do for good and wise reasons. In other words, he's speaking from his own knowledge for the purpose of effecting the course of action of another.  On the other hand, we have Tolkien himself in his letters who has left open the remote possibility of another of greater power than Sauron's being able to unmake the ring. Whether such a power exists he does not state, but it suggests that the answer to your question might be ""Possibly, yes"".  So within the context of the stories, as far as Gandalf and Frodo know, there is no other way besides Orodruin. But stepping back we are able to know things that the characters themselves don't.  I think that by looking at the question from this perspective eliminates the uncertainty or controversy."

But stepping back we are able to know things that the characters themselves don't.   There's also the point that Gandalf knew that Aulë or Fëanor destroying the Ring was an impossibility, even if they may have had the skill to do so. Thus, he would have seen no point in bringing it up, though he did bring up the similarly impossible dragons."
tolkienfans,387qgj,Edledhron,2,Tue Jun 2 17:05:30 2015 UTC,"While I agree with everything you're saying about perspective, I don't think it eliminates the uncertainty at all. The answer to the question is ""Possibly, yes,"" but that means it's also ""Possibly, no."" Which is basically to say, ""We aren't really sure."" There exists a possibility that the Ring could be destroyed by someone with sufficient knowledge, but that is not the same thing as a certainty that it could. Ultimately, we can't give a definitive answer to the question because the possibility was never tested, so it remains uncertain."
tolkienfans,387qgj,fearsomeduckins,3,Wed Jun 3 01:30:22 2015 UTC,"Don't the greatest smiths put something of themselves into their creation?  And aren't the limits that the great smiths encounter are not technical knowledge, but something more akin to Will?   Could any of the great smiths have actually Willed the One's destruction?    It was beautiful, remember.  Comparable to the Simirils, in the sense that it it the greatest creation of one of Arda's greatest smiths. Destroying it would run counter to everything that animates the great smiths.  I not sure that Aule has it in him to destroy something like the One."
tolkienfans,387qgj,1_wing_angel,5,Tue Jun 2 20:47:57 2015 UTC,That's the passage I was thinking of. It does provide some more context so thanks for posting it.
tolkienfans,387qgj,harabanaz,23,Tue Jun 2 17:06:31 2015 UTC,"Destroying it in Orodruin was the only way among the available options.  The Valar could have destroyed it.  Certainly Aulë could have done for the trinket that his earlier, treacherous upstart brat of a pupil had cobbled together.  Eru could have destroyed it.  Presumably a sufficiently penitent Fëanor, somehow defeating the Ringlust, would have had the skill - but as others have noted, that dude, as we know him, could not have been trusted with the task.  I can just imagine the Ring whispering to him: Hey.  Psst.  I can help you get your Silmarils back, you know, and in the bargain achieve your revenge on all who have kept them from you and make you lord and king of Middle-earth as you set out to become when you freed yourself from thralldom in Aman!  Letting it sit on a Tsar Bomba when it went off might have achieved it, as presumably dropping it into the Sun to sink down to where the hydrogen fusion takes place... neither of these options were available.  Specifically Fëanor would not be given a few days out of Mandos to have a go at it.  Gandalf just had to make do with what he had, and arranging for it to be somehow dunked in the fire of Orodruin was the only thing that he did have.  And so he went and did it."
tolkienfans,387qgj,fearsomeduckins,17,Tue Jun 2 15:27:21 2015 UTC,"I'm not aware of any instance where the fires of Orodruin being able to destroy the Ring are directly tied to their heat; it's very common for people to read that into the statements based on the context of the paragraph, but as far as I know each time Tolkien talks about it he mentions only that Orodruin is the only place it can be unmade, rather than it being the only place not enough; an important distinction. It's distinctly possible that it's something to do with Orodruin being the place of it's creation that allows the magic binding the ring to be undone, rather than the heat. The Ring is clearly magical, and as such might resist and equal or greater physical  heat than Orodruin's if that heat lacked the specific magical properties that Orodruin's flames may contain."
tolkienfans,387qgj,harabanaz,11,Tue Jun 2 15:40:37 2015 UTC,"That's why I went hyperbole overdrive in examples of heat sources other than Orodruin that might destroy the Ring.  Particularly hot lava, fresh from the magma chamber, can reach 1200 degrees Celsius; hundreds of millions of years ago some peculiarly hot lavas are thought to have reached 1600 degrees.  Preindustrial humans could melt metals, including cast iron and gold, at temperatures approaching that of hot lava, so in the Tolkienverse it's conceivable that Dwarves and Elves, at least, could match the heat of any lava in their smithies.  So yes, I agree with you that Orodruin's power to melt the Ring was not merely due to the heat.  It would be the heat (since the Ring was not unmade until it did fall into the lava) and something else.  I suppose once the Ring fell into the lava it became, for that time, like to any other golden ring, to be melted if it reached 1064 degrees Celsius (if pure gold)."
tolkienfans,387qgj,EyeceEyeceBaby,7,Tue Jun 2 16:46:25 2015 UTC,"I was actually in the middle of typing a similar example when I got called away for a meeting. Mine involved Dragons though. The One wasn't the only ring made of gold, Vilya was also. And we know that dragon fire could melt the Rings of Power (save for the One), meaning it must be at least 1,064°C. As you point out, this is within the approximate range of lava (700 to 1,200 °C).  The conclusion would be that dragons could breath fire of similar temperature to lava, and yet could not destroy the One, indicating that it's not simply the heat of the lava that is destroying the Ring."
tolkienfans,387qgj,Elliot850,5,Tue Jun 2 17:49:02 2015 UTC,"So during Bilbos adventure, had he been roasted alive by smaug while in possession of the ring... Could it in theory have destroyed it?"
tolkienfans,387qgj,EyeceEyeceBaby,17,Tue Jun 2 18:05:42 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately no:   there is not now any dragon left on earth in which the old fire is hot enough; nor was there ever any dragon, not even Ancalagon the Black, who could have harmed the One Ring   Gandalf is saying that all the other Rings of Power could have been destroyed by dragons, but the One Ring, the one Bilbo took, would have been impervious to such a roasting."
tolkienfans,387qgj,Rudefire,3,Tue Jun 2 18:08:36 2015 UTC,"Can you elaborate on the ""little push from Eru""?"
tolkienfans,387qgj,EyeceEyeceBaby,15,Tue Jun 2 23:26:09 2015 UTC,"Tolkien's letters contain a number of instances in which readers point out (sometimes rather fervently) that Frodo was a failure. At the crucial moment he gave in and could not destroy the Ring (in fact no one could have). Moreover he should be reviled, not honored as he is. Tolkien writes in response that it's true he failed and at the crucial moment the ""Writer of the Story"" took over in order for the quest to succeed. By this of course he is referring to Eru. He also defends Frodo by pointing out that he should be honored for the mercy he showed Gollum in spite of his evil nature.  Here is one of the relevant quotes from Letter 192:     Frodo deserved all honour because he spent every drop of his power of will and body, and that was just sufficient to bring him to the destined point, and no further. Few others, possibly no others of his time, would have got so far. The Other Power then took over: the Writer of the Story (by which I do not mean myself), 'that one ever-present Person who is never absent and never named'"
tolkienfans,387qgj,Uluithiad,6,Wed Jun 3 00:08:26 2015 UTC,"However, 'taking over' and actively doing something ('a little push') are wholly separate concepts when you're talking about an individual responsible for everything outside other wills.

tolkienfans,387qgj,rainmaninjapan,2,Wed Jun 3 00:55:50 2015 UTC,"I don't like to think that Eru actually pushed Gollum in. Why can't it just be him falling in on accident?

tolkienfans,387qgj,EyeceEyeceBaby,6,Wed Jun 3 01:21:41 2015 UTC,"My wording was a little poor. I did not mean that Eru literally pushed in Gollum. ""A little push"" was simply meant as a euphemism for his ""taking over."" Uluithiad's clarification is a bit more accurate to what actually happened.  To the point of your comment though, I don't think it negates everything that came before. All the actors in the story took part and chose their path of their own free will, and their achievements still stand. Perhaps a better way to think of it is as an accident, but an accident that was a part of the Music of the Ainur, guided by Eru. Eru's comment to Melkor during the Music comes to mind: ""no theme may be played that hath not its uttermost source in me, nor can any alter the music in my despite."""

Sauron's is at worst a 75, so it's going to be close.  If Fëanor had the Deconstitution perk he could definitely have unmade the Ring, but Sauron had a higher spellcasting level (about 85 to Fëanor's 70) so he might have been able to block Fëanor deconstitute with a Double Binding enchantment, provided he had enough bonus health crystals from which to draw extra mana."

Events in the East and South were explicitly tied to Sauron though, and he controlled many kindgoms, including Numenorean outposts.  Here's some things we do know, prior to Elendil's refugees returning (from Sil):   And Sauron gathered to him great strength of his servants out of the east and the south; and among them were not a few of the high race of Númenor. For in the days of the sojourn of Sauron in that land the hearts of well nigh all its people had been turned towards darkness. Therefore many of those who sailed east in that time and made fortresses and dwellings upon the coasts were already bent to his will, and they served him still gladly in Middle-earth. But because of the power of Gil-galad these renegades, lords both mighty and evil, for the most part took up their abodes in the southlands far away; yet two there were, Herumor and Fuinur, who rose to power among the Haradrim, a great and cruel people that dwelt in the wide lands south of Mordor beyond the mouths of Anduin."

Certainly we see that trope again in Beren and Luthien, but I think it's more likely that he was influenced by one of Lofn's arrangements in the Gylfaginning, or something else from that era. Particularly, Beren has no family opposed to the union (or much of one at all), and Luthien's kin are divided on the issue."

As a scholar he certainly had some disdain and not much interest in things Shakesperian, but we do see some bits of dialog in the Lord of the Rings inspired from the bard.  I think if you want closer analogies to Beren and Luthien, look instead to the greek myth of Orpheus and Euridyce, parts of the Kalevala, or the story of Dido and Aeneas."

tolkienfans,384d7s,PrivateChicken,2,Mon Jun 1 21:09:48 2015 UTC,That's for sure. I suppose I should have put that disclaimer.
tolkienfans,384d7s,am2370,8,Mon Jun 1 21:22:41 2015 UTC,"Boz4pm has a great ""Girl drops into middle earth"" type fic that actually examines a lot of stuff overlooked by fics of the same type. It's an attempt at an honest to god what would happen if someone from modern times did drop in... the author manages to make it hilarious, touching, in-depth, and as canon-friendly as anything I've ever read. She really cares for the characters as Tolkien wrote them, and it isn't some sloppy wish fulfillment. It's got a wonderful sequel as well.   I also enjoy Lalaithuveril's fics. Most are different takes on Eomer/Lothiriel, if you like romance.   JunoMagic is an excellent writer, although she took down her magnum opus ""The Tides of Time and the Bones of the Earth"" for personal reasons. It was a fic set far in the future of Middle Earth when the last descendent of the Grey Haven's lighthouse keepers goes on a final quest to save the world from apocalyptic destruction wrought thousands of years later as the world crumbles from war, disease, and the lack of ""magic"" which Sauron wrought by sapping the earth of strength in making the rings. I won't get too into it, but descendents of the Fellowship appear as well as many of the elves we know who left for Valinor that have bittersweet feelings about returning to the world of men to save it. After she took the fic down I messaged her asking nicely to send me an e-copy so I could read it whenever, and she very kindly obliged. She may do the same for you! She also has a tenth-walker fic ""Lothiriel"" which is great, although definitely less realistic than Boz's. It's more of a novel style and the titular character (named for the Dol Amroth princess, but not her) is a great female protagonist.  As you can see, I read a lot of fanfic. My standards are fairly high and the majority of the fics I read feature prominent female characters... something I always found kinda lacking with Tolkien, at least in describing them as less pedestals and more breathing living beings."

Its free till lvl 28ish. But you can see thorins gate, bree, shire, fornost, carn dum, erebor, moira, lothlorien, all of rohan, helms deep, osgilith, and minas tirith is coming soon but you can get on a high hill and look over pelenor to look at it.

No.   Stay away from Romance fics. ""Lemon"" or ""lime"" means graphic (and often gratuitous) sex. Any fanfiction that introduces a tenth member of the fellowship is just wish fullfillment on the part of the author. Ugh, just thinking about the fanfiction I read as a 14 year old makes me nauseous.   I really can't think of a single fanfiction that is ""loyal and true"", because the good fanfiction authors never stick to fanfiction - they always end up writing their own literature. Go read A Song of Ice and Fire or Wheel of Time or a series in the fantasy/science fiction genre. The trophs are similar enough that it will scratch that itch without giving you literary AIDS. Maybe I'm just biased because I read too much shitty fanfiction as a young adult, but if good LOTR fanfiction is out there, I never found it."

tolkienfans,37ymyi,pauldrye,28,Sun May 31 14:50:16 2015 UTC,"Indeed,   ...fleeing from the north she went down into Beleriand, and dwelt beneath Ered Gorgoroth, in that dark valley that was after called Nan Dungortheb, the Valley of Dreadful Death, because of the horror that she bred there. For other foul creatures of spider form had dwelt there since the days of the delving of Angband, and she mated with them, and devoured them.   The fact that they appear concurrently with Angband suggests that they are related to Morgoth in some way. Ungoliant was also said to have been in the service of Morgoth before moving to Avathar, so perhaps they originate from herself."
tolkienfans,37ymyi,PrivateChicken,13,Sun May 31 17:10:40 2015 UTC,"Hm, so the question then must be, what exactly is the nature of these ""other foul creatures of spider form""?  -Naturally big spiders  -Natural spiders of Yavanna, corrupted by Melkor to grow in size?  -Maiar who turned/were turned into ""foul creatures of spider form"" (something along the lines of a Balrog)"

The Silmarillion also explains the origins of Balrogs, Dragons, Wizards, Ents and pretty much everyone else.  It is more of a history book than a novel such as LotR. It is also full of battles and it is generally a bit darker than LotR. It is very different reading experience. I loved the Silmarillion, but I hear many people find it hard to get through.

tolkienfans,37hqxi,Uluithiad,17,Wed May 27 21:34:26 2015 UTC,"and his main front of attack was through Angmar   I'm not sure we can call anything he did for most of the Third Age his main front of attack, since he was responsible for so much. From the corruption of Greenwood the Great, to the Great Plague, to the repeated invasions of Gondor by Easterlings and even from Mordor itself for the last thousand years of the age, he wasn't exactly idle."

tolkienfans,37hqxi,PrivateChicken,7,Wed May 27 22:26:09 2015 UTC,"In the appendices the plague is stated to have become less effective as it moved north west; the Arthedain were little troubled by it. Additionally, it's also noted in the appendices that this was a period of suffering for Gondor's enemies as well. Easterlings and Southrons were unable to overwhelm Gondor due to the proliferation of evil things in their own lands (presumably the plague counts among these evils). So I wouldn't call the plague a total slam dunk.  Another point to consider is that people develop resistances to diseases, especially after high lethality pandemics. So Sauron couldn't have used to the same disease twice anyways."
tolkienfans,37hqxi,ANewMachine615,3,Wed May 27 22:57:53 2015 UTC,"So, you have to understand Sauron's tactical situation at the end of the War of the Last Alliance, after he loses the Ring. First, he's lost the Ring, which sucks for him. He's lost his body, as Gil-Galad and Elendil killed it. So he's gotta spend time re-embodying. However, this body-and-Ring-loss happened at the end of a seven year siege of Barad-dur, which itself was the capstone on a much longer war between the Numenoreans and Elves on one side, and Sauron on the other, which had been going in one form or another for 12 years. He'd been pushed back to Barad-dur and imprisoned there after the first five. The Alliance was unquestionably supreme on the field, though they were unable to break Barad-dur itself. They'd crushed Sauron's largest armies, and were capable of doing it again and again.  However, he knew he had time on his side. Elves were diminishing and going West, so one enemy was slowly removing itself from the equation. The Men of the West were diminishing just due to inter-breeding with non-Numenoreans, and the subsequent lessening effects of the Gift of the Valar to their people. The mightiest of Men would pass within a generation, and things would only get worse for Men from there, barring a few stand-outs with near-pure Numenorean features like Faramir, Denethor, and Aragorn. So all he had to do was wait long enough.  Of course, Sauron being Sauron, he also hatched a ton of intermediate plans to weaken his foes. Darkening the Greenwood took a lot of Elvish resources away from combating him directly, as they dealt with Mirkwood. He exploited the breakup of Arnor to crush the new, divided kingdoms that came out of it. He rebuilt Mordor as Gondor's power waned.  All in all, he did a pretty good job of doing whatever he could throughout the Third Age. It's just that ""whatever he could"" was fairly limited, since he didn't want to provoke the remaining Elves and Men to come after him before he was ready."
tolkienfans,37hqxi,PrivateChicken,18,Fri May 29 19:50:57 2015 UTC,"Sauron was ""powerless"" because he was killed in the last alliance by Gil Galad and Elendil (or maybe Isildur dealt the final blow, Elrond's account at the council in Rivendell isn't entirely clear IMO.)  In any case, once the Ring was cut from Sauron's hand he no longer access to it's power in the same way as before. It's actually incorrect to say Sauron was entirely powerless without the Ring. When not wearing the Ring Sauron obviously still had what ever native strength was left to him, but also the power that he had put into the Ring was always in rapport with himself while the Ring lasted. The chief benefit Sauron received when actually wielding the Ring was the his power was enhanced. With the Ring Sauron was greater than the sum of his parts.  So Sauron's real difficulty during the Third Age is not the loss of the Ring -he probably could have conquered Middle Earth with out it on his finger- but his lack of a body. Sauron has reincarnated himself before; he did so in between the destruction of Numenor and the war of the Last Alliance. It takes him nearly three millennia to to gather the energy reincarnate himself once more, but soon after he does, Sauron sets his plans in motion and declares himself openly."

This is the correct answer. It wasn't the cutting of the ring that destroyed Sauron, as is portrayed in the LOTR movies by Peter Jackson. The ring was removed from Sauron's body AFTER he had been defeated in combat by Gil Galad and Elendil, who also perished from the final duel with the dark lord.   Sauron was physically killed, but because the ring was not destroyed, his spirit was still bound to middle earth. Eventually he recuperated and was able to take a physical form again.   Note: Another very common misconception is that Sauron had no physical body during the LOTR events."
tolkienfans,37hqxi,cats_are_pussies,4,Thu May 28 16:33:20 2015 UTC,"Note: Another very common misconception is that Sauron had no physical body during the LOTR events.    I know the appearance of Sauron in the movies differs a lot from the books, but I can't remember reading clearly that Sauron had a physical body at the end of the third age, during lotr events. Do you have a source on this? Because if he did have a body; why didn't he appear when Aragorn came knocking at his front door with too small an army? Maybe he was afraid of Narsil..? Now I'm curious!"
tolkienfans,37hqxi,DividingPrescott,11,Fri May 29 21:35:13 2015 UTC,"My belief is that sauron feared being defeated in physical combat again.  He had been pwned before, when he had better magic gear.   Letter #200:  It was because of this pre-occupation with the Children of God that the spirits so often took the form and likeness of the Children, especially after their appearance. It was thus that Sauron appeared in this shape. It is mythologically supposed that when this shape was 'real', that is a physical actuality in the physical world and not a vision transferred from mind to mind, it took some time to build up. It was then destructible like other physical organisms. But that of course did not destroy the spirit, nor dismiss it from the world to which it was bound until the end. After the battle with Gil-galad and Elendil, Sauron took a long while to re-build, longer than he had done after the Downfall of Númenor (I suppose because each building-up used up some of the inherent energy of the spirit, which might be called the 'will' or the effective link between the indestructible mind and being and the realization of its imagination). The impossibility of re-building after the destruction of the Ring, is sufficiently clear 'mythologically' in the present book.  Letter #246:  Sauron should be thought of as very terrible.

Obviously he needed time to recover, so for much of the first two millennium the Nazgul were the only physical means he had of exerting his dominance."
tolkienfans,37hqxi,Hq3473,10,Wed May 27 22:46:28 2015 UTC,"Imagine a heavily armored and armed knight riding a warhorse.  Now imagine what happens when that knight is unhorsed.  The knight is alive, the horse is alive, but the knight can't really fight anymore because he relied on the horse for mobility, and can't really move without it.  Now, eventually, the knight might recover, take off the heavy armor, adjust in other ways, and re-join the fight.  Same thing happened to Sauron. He came to heavily rely on the ring. When he was separated from the ring he became powerless like an unhorsed knight.  Eventually, he pulled himself together, and re-joined the fight."
tolkienfans,37hqxi,Mycd,5,Wed May 27 19:41:08 2015 UTC,"A fine analogy, but there's good citations to explain this as well.  Sauron was killed (along with Elendil and Gil-Galad) and had his Ring taken. This was essentially just a long setback, since the ring was never actually destroyed.   His spirit endured, being a powerful Maiar, and he fled far from Middle Earth for some time. His Nine wraiths escaped too, to later reconnect with him at Dol Guldur, or cause their own troubles in Angmar, and in the south and East. During this age Gondor blossomed and the elves endured - but he was not idle during the 3rd Age. He plotted, steered southrons and easterlins, ruined Mirkwood, and generally caused trouble - but was kept in check by the vigilence of Gondor and the power of the elves, wizards, etc. Regardless, he was not 'powerless', just kept in check. He was always plotting secrets, building his strength and marshalling armies, breeding orcs and fel winged steeds, all this while also searching for news of his Ring."

In reality, an unhorsed knight (assuming he was unwounded) would be back on his feet in moments and fighting very effectively. Armor isn't nearly as restrictive as it has sometimes been portrayed. It actually hampers your movements very little. Even in full battle armor for a mounted knight, you'd still be able to run, jump, even roll. If you were wearing a bolted-on tournament helm that would be an issue for visibility, but those were never actually used in battle."

This does not mean that he'd use force against Galadriel to get her ring. Remember, Galadriel is one of the Noldor who came to ME with Feanor and who has witnessed the light of the two trees. The elves have extremely high regard for such things and no Silvan elf from Greenwood would take up arms against the ones from Lothlorien.  As for Gondor, they'd have no use for her ring as it is useless in terms of martial prowess. It cannot defeat anyone on a battlefield. So it is pretty much useless to them."

Possibly he didn't want to get into a knock-down drag-out fight with Gandalf, which is what would have happened if he did try to take it.

By that time it has lost its power since the One Ring has been destroyed.  In The Silmarillion it is mentioned that Círdan gives Narya to Gandalf, to rekindle hope in others. I don't think we specifically know whether the ""magic"" Gandalf does is all from Gandalf, from the Ring or a bit of both.  I think Gandalf is often reluctant to show his power, because his mission when he was sent to Middle-earth as a Wizard was to oppose Sauron, but not use force on the Free Peoples.

He absolutely used them. If it weren't for the efforts of Merry and Pippin, Sauron would have successfully used the wizards to destroy Rohan and open a two-front war against Gondor (a war which we know from later events could not have been won even on one front). And it's been suggested (but not known for sure) that the Blue Wizards who were sent East became corrupted and were used for Sauron's cause as well. Rhadagast wouldn't have been too useful, he was simple, all he cared about were his birds and beasts, and he became a pawn of Saruman anyway. Gandalf was the only wizard who stayed steadfast and resisted the Enemy.   Also, this   He must have thought them to be eccentric wizards, nothing more   Doesn't really make sense. They were the only wizards. You must understand, from a modern perspective, Middle Earth is kind of a ""low magic"" world. This isn't DnD where there is a wizard for every four other people. There are exactly five of them in the entire world, and they only have that distinction because they were put there by the gods. The only magic that we see from anyone who isn't angelic or a Ringbearer is Luthien singing against Sauron and singing Morgoth to sleep, and the magical disguises used by Finrod and Luthien. In Tolkien's world, magic is always decreasing, always going away, and by the time that the Lord of the Rings comes around, it's pretty much all gone, except for the Ainur and the Rings."

I cant imagine how much karma is to be had when a student catches his teacher asking reddit to come up with the homework.   I think the advice depends on the type class it is.  Are the students paying for this course expecting it to be taught by a specialist or at least someone very familiar with his work? If it's a class where the real focus is building english comprehension then I think you're ok. If it's a literature class based on getting to grips with Tolkien I think it's borderline unethical to accept the position as teacher when you've not read the books in 20 years. The fact that you're here shows that you care about the quality of your work but I don't think this is an appropriate resource to prop up your lack of knowledge.   edit: It occurred to me that I was picturing this as a course run by a university. If you're talking about a course taught at a local community centre and the students are just paying a nominal fee disregard the above original comment.
tolkienfans,37ehv9,dontbelikeyou,1 point,Wed May 27 13:53:38 2015 UTC,"Hey, thanks for the comment. It is indeed a community center based lesson, and the primary focus is English language / literature through the Lord Of The Rings series.  Apparently the group of students made the choice of reading material and the previous teacher happened to be a huge Tolkien fan.   Personally I do get a lot of enjoyment out of Tolkien myself, but as mentioned; it's been a long time. Continuing on with the lesson would be preferable than just shutting it down and having these poor people left with no teacher. I am an English literature teacher (which is a rarity in Japan) so I am familiar with how to teach this kind of class. I just worry about prep time (which is two weeks) and my current lack of knowledge with the series lore and such. I do want to give these people a good class.  Cheers"
tolkienfans,37ehv9,fearsomeduckins,4,Thu May 28 05:47:17 2015 UTC,"10-15 pages might be a bit ambitious, unless your students are very good. I don't think many of the Japanese English teachers I've worked with could comfortably manage 15 pages of Tolkien within 2 hours (minus warm up time), let alone the students. Is the focus of the class Tolkien, or is the focus of the class English? That will make a difference with what you want to focus on. In my experience, Japanese senior citizens tend to be pretty laid back about what you're doing in class, so as long as you present the activities confidently it will probably go well. One thing I'd recommend is getting a digital copy of the books; it can be really, really handy to have a search function when you want to find a specific passage quickly."

tolkienfans,37ehnx,Squirrel_Boy_1,11,Wed May 27 01:10:18 2015 UTC,"After Sauron first put on the One Ring, there was at least enough time for the elf-lords to take off their Rings before Sauron could take control of their minds. I would guess that some of the Ring's power is always active, but doing anything major with it requires actively ""invoking"" its power. Some of Frodo's conversation with Galadriel is relevant here:   'I would ask one thing before we go,' said Frodo, 'a thing which I often meant to ask Gandalf in Rivendell. I am permitted to wear the One Ring: why cannot I see all the others and know the thoughts of those that wear them?'  'You have not tried,' she said. 'Only thrice have you set the Ring upon your finger since you knew what you possessed. Do not try! It would destroy you. Did not Gandalf tell you that the rings give power according to the measure of each possessor? Before you could use that power you would need to become far stronger, and to train your will to the domination of others. Yet even so, as Ring-bearer and as one that has borne it on finger and seen that which is hidden, your sight is grown keener. You have perceived my thought more clearly than many that are accounted wise. You saw the Eye of him that holds the Seven and the Nine. And did you not see and recognize the ring upon my finger? Did you see my ring?' she asked turning again to Sam.  'No, Lady,' he answered. 'To tell you the truth, I wondered what you were talking about. I saw a star through your finger. But if you'll pardon my speaking out, I think my master was right. I wish you'd take his Ring. You'd put things to rights. You'd stop them digging up the gaffer and turning him adrift. You'd make some folk pay for their dirty work.'  'I would,' she said. 'That is how it would begin. But it would not stop with that, alas! We will not speak more of it. Let us go!'   Even without consciously willing it, Frodo is able to see Galadriel's Ring. But he would need to ""train his will"" in order to see or alter the thoughts of other Ringbearers, which would imply a conscious effort. Later, it seems that Frodo does begin to access some fraction of this power:   With a violent heave Sam rose up. At once he drew his sword; but he could do nothing. Gollum and Frodo were locked together. Gollum was tearing at his master, trying to get at the chain and the Ring. This was probably the only thing that could have roused the dying embers of Frodo's heart and will: an attack, an attempt to wrest his treasure from him by force. He fought back with a sudden fury that amazed Sam, and Gollum also. Even so things might have gone far otherwise, if Gollum himself had remained unchanged; but whatever dreadful paths, lonely and hungry and waterless, he had trodden, driven by a devouring desire and a terrible fear, they had left grievous marks on him. He was a lean, starved, haggard thing, all bones and tight-drawn sallow skin. A wild light flamed in his eyes, but his malice was no longer matched by his old gripping strength. Frodo flung him off and rose up quivering.  'Down, down!' he gasped, clutching his hand to his breast, so that beneath the cover of his leather shirt he clasped the Ring. 'Down you creeping thing, and out of my path! Your time is at an end. You cannot betray me or slay me now.'  Then suddenly, as before under the eaves of the Emyn Muil, Sam saw these two rivals with other vision. A crouching shape, scarcely more than the shadow of a living thing, a creature now wholly ruined and defeated, yet filled with a hideous lust and rage; and before it stood stern, untouchable now by pity, a figure robed in white, but at its breast it held a wheel of fire. Out of the fire there spoke a commanding voice.  'Begone, and trouble me no more! If you touch me ever again, you shall be cast yourself into the Fire of Doom.'  The crouching shape backed away, terror in its blinking eyes, and yet at the same time insatiable desire.  Then the vision passed and Sam saw Frodo standing, hand on breast, his breath coming in great gasps, and Gollum at his feet, resting on his knees with his wide-splayed hands upon the ground."
tolkienfans,37ehnx,PersonUsingAComputer,5,Wed May 27 03:52:23 2015 UTC,"The power that was within them came from the forgers of the Rings.  It is fairly well established in Tolkien's mythology that when you create something, a part of you goes into it.  This is why Feanor could never remake the Silmarils, or Yavanna the Two Trees.  When Sauron made the One Ring, he poured enough of himself into it that without it, he would be crippled.  When it was unmade, that portion of his power was destroyed, and so was he, for all intents and purposes.  Because the One Ring had so much of his spirit within it, it corrupted all who held it.  This is why the Ring kept trying to return to him; it was a part of him.  At the same time, the rings are partially powered by those who wear them, or rather, their power is amplified.  A hobbit is turned invisible and given life beyond his appointed years; a Maia (Gandalf) or an Elf (Galadriel) is able to draw on more power because they are more inherently powerful.  At the same time, they are also more susceptible to the corrupting influence of the Ring, which is why Gandalf  and Galadriel refuse even to touch it.  It should also be noted that when Morgoth was overthrown, Sauron repented, at least at first.  He desired to heal the hurts of Morgoth, but then began to desire power, while deceiving himself for a time to believe that he still desired to do good.  That part of Sauron is a part of the Ring's spirit, if you will.  This desire to do good and then to unwittingly become evil is another reason that Gandalf and Galadriel will not take the ring, and they both say as much to Frodo.  In Tolkien's philosophy, evil magic is that which seeks to dominate, and good magic is that which enhances.  The One Ring did the former, and the Three did the latter.  Hopefully that answers your question and also makes some amount of sense.  EDIT: minor clarifications"
tolkienfans,37ehnx,GrimnirOdinson,3,Wed May 27 02:14:25 2015 UTC,"in my head, when Sauron took the shape of Annatar, he was on some level still ""repentant."" He did have a trace of a genuine desire to heal the Middle Earth.  That is why Celimbrimbor and Gwaith-i-Mírdain believed Sauron - there was something genuine there.  Of course, that genuine desire would eventually turn into nothing but a thin facade of feigned righteousness."

To appreciate and explore the world around me. It makes me want to enjoy food, drink and cheer with friends. It takes the simple and makes it so tremendously large and wonderful that it's hard not to appreciate it. Amidst the grand and the beautiful, Tolkien glorifies the simple and exalts the ordinary. He restores beauty and magic to what is commonly seen as dull. He really evokes a sense of awe at the world and captures the wonder that is existence."

The stories he wrote all grew from a history he was making up to help explain the development of those languages. Many names and locations all have meaning and significance. I've never seen anything like it in any other book.  We're not going to have another Tolkien until we have someone as educated as he was in medieval literature, myths, and the development of the English language. That's a tall order.

tolkienfans,37b517,Kiltmanenator,2,Wed May 27 02:28:41 2015 UTC,"Saying Tolkien is one of the greatest authors in the fantasy genre immediately undermines his greatness, for there are many who would discount fantasy in modern literature.  But Tolkien was heavily influenced by medieval literature that is unfamiliar to modern readers, monster stories and fairy tales composed by adults, for an adult audience.  He started writing his own stories long before The Hobbit, often in poetic form.  With The Hobbit he was cautious, telling a heroic fantasy epic in a children's book, the most acceptable genre in which to publish such literature at that time.  But the influence of his private writings came through and the book often spoke to, and appealed to, the adults who read it to their children.  In The Lord of the Rings he mostly abandoned the idea of writing a children's book, although because it was a sequel it still centered on hobbits.  In many ways the book was still appropriate for children, there was nothing that would shock children or their parents, but only a few children could read it to themselves, and it would take a very long time to read it at bedtime.    Tolkien doubled down on what some considered the flaws of The Hobbit -- too long and complicated for children, too childish for adults.  In LotR he wrote a book three times as long but did not take out the elements of heroic fantasy that caused the audience of the day to think of it as a children's book -- indeed, the NY Times famously called it an overgrown children's book.  It took a long time for LotR to find it's audience, and it didn't really take off until Tolkien was forced to publish a paperback edition.  That meant it still wasn't accepted as a work of adult literature, but rather as popular fiction.  Even now when it is taught in universities it usually is a gateway to the medievel literature that influenced him."

She lists the light and the water separately, to me indicating they were placed within the phial separately. As for why this light is special, Eärendil’s star is the last place remaining in Middle-Earth to see the light of the Silmarils, jewels of fantastic beauty and great importance from the First Age. Of the three made, two were lost to the earth and the sea, leaving only the one that Eärendil carries aboard his ship in the sky still viewable to those in Arda. The Silmarils would have been of special importance to a Noldo such as Galadriel, who took some part in the attempt of the Noldor to recover them from the first dark lord several thousand years prior.

Just like the door to Erebor needs to be light at an exact angle on Durin's Day, Galadriel could have a similar astronomical way of crafting such a fountain?"

tolkienfans,37atux,mylovertotoro,4,Tue May 26 06:51:10 2015 UTC,"I'm sure you are aware of this but it's important to point out the position of The Fellowship of the Ring in the larger picture of what Tolkien created. It's not a book that can stand on its own (and it wasn't written as such) but rather just the first third of The Lord of the Rings. Without the rest of the book it's difficult to put things into context unless you focus on only the things available to the reader in the first part.  If you look at how Tolkien wrote The Lord of the Rings, and the numerous changes he made as he went along, you still find in the first couple hundred pages the simple hobbit story he originally started with - Farmer Maggot, the Old Forest, Bree, etc. (Something that is itself worthy of an essay.) As the book goes on, and grows more complicated, we begin to see more of the things you mention. However, if you are only looking at The Fellowship of the Ring (i.e. the beginning of The Lord of the Rings) a great deal is still unknown to the reader and things have only begun to happen. For example, Théoden is not mentioned by name until the middle of The Two Towers and we have seen very little actual violence compared to what is to come."
tolkienfans,37atux,Billy_Fish,2,Tue May 26 08:23:14 2015 UTC,"You've made a chunk of your essay in the spoiler tag, which I can't navigate to read (and I'm sure others won't either). Based on what I can see, here is some feedback:  FotR, first of all, was more towards the end of the Tolkien's writing career more than the beginning. I feel it is inaccurate and misleading to describe it as laying the groundwork for defining his career. If his career was ever defined, it was in his Beowulf essay (his career was foremost a language academic). And if his writing style was ever paradigmatic, it could be argued that this was DURING FotR not as a result of it.   You mention Tolkien's words about Bombadil. I think you would be wise to include the actual letter(s) and quotes to further back up your point. I don't know them off the top of my head but I'm sure a quick google will oblige.   Most importantly, I feel the essay somewhat lacks focus. It finished talking about peace, pacifism and morals yet halfway through you spend a lot of time talking about mistakes. Again, I can't see the stuff in the spoiler tag so this may help or hinder. You only seem to start making your point about Bombadil at the end. I would recommend making your introduction more clear as to what you're going to say, and removing the baggage about Bombadil's history. This can be replaced with evidence that war had an effect on Tolkien's writing, which could then be used to back up your point that Bombadil is in some way a reaction to this.   From a Tolkien fan's point of view your opinion that Bombadil is Tolkien's moral ideal is, at best, highly debatable. There are many types of people and motivations throughout Lord of the Rings, and Tolkien does not make it clear which is supposed to be analogous with what he'd like (though we can take a good guess...). I would recommend you deal with Hobbit society, Rohirrim (representing medieval/early Middle Ages Europe/England) and Gondor under the rule of Aragorn and explain why you think those are NOT Tolkien's ideal. Also, specifically, you harm your point by saying that Tolkien saw war as a 'necessary response' to a threat; but then claiming that Tolkien's ideal is one of a complete pacifist.   Good luck."
tolkienfans,37atux,Endelir,1 point,Tue May 26 07:49:53 2015 UTC,"I think Frodo does become a pacifist of sorts (though Tolkien is reluctant to call him one in the ""modern sense,"" see Letter 195) over the course of his journey—besides the passages regarding Gollum, looking at his actions in RotK, particularly during the Scouring of the Shire, might be a good place for OP to find evidence of this."

Saruman's orcs were in turn ambushed by the Rohirrim near Fangorn Forest.  On the way to Mordor, Frodo and Sam witness an ambush by Faramir and his men on Southern armies coming to Mordor.  Frodo and Sam are then captured by Faramir, and later, so is Gollum, in a kind of ambush in which Frodo is an accomplice.  There are references in the text and appendices to the ambush of Isildur by orcs between the Anduin and Mirkwood, and Isildur's attempt to escape by jumping into the Anduin, where the Ring slipped off his finger and he was shot.  In the Scouring, the hobbits ambushed Saruman's ruffians and drove them out of the Shire after a short skirmish."

The hobbits also ambushed some of Saruman's soldiers in the Scouring of the Shire. They were also ambushed at Weathertop and the Ford by the ringwraiths. Amon Hen was also very much an ambush.

tolkienfans,36zypv,The_Flabbergaster,8,Sat May 23 16:30:35 2015 UTC,Well it doesn't directly mean a decline in population but more of a cultural (or as you said role) diminishment.

And that is absolute rubbish, which you know, since you've been quoting from the very section that deals with it.  But let me point out that the burden is not actually on me right now to make the argument. The simple fact remains that neither of your pieces of evidence suggest that there was no basis in JRRT for the Fall of Doriath in the Sil. And if GGK is making his claim of it being more creative than scholarly about the Silmarillion as a whole, he is ridiculously and blatantly wrong, as well as not making the argument you wish to support."
tolkienfans,36yejp,Uluithiad,2,Sun May 24 18:03:21 2015 UTC,"That's still a far cry from saying that it's fan fiction, even sophisticated fan fiction. The vast majority of the published Silmarillion was written by JRRT. The only place that CT made a pastiche was the fall of Doriath, and he explains pretty clearly why he did so (and why he later regretted it). Given the impossible task he had — his father's works are inconsistent with themselves! — he did a very good job, more than good enough for the casual reader.  Should it be considered 'canon'? No; but don't throw the baby out with the bathwater, either."
tolkienfans,36yejp,ebneter,1 point,Sun May 24 19:41:00 2015 UTC,"I think at some point it's acceptable for us to acknowledge that JRRT is dead and someone else needs to be the curator of what is and isn't canon. It's not exactly practical for the fandom for the only canon to be the stuff that was published by JRRT; that leaves us with LOTR only, and arguably the Hobbit. Basically, if we want anything beyond LOTR as canon, someone needs to be able to decide what is and isn't worthy of being canon, and if that isn't CT I don't know who it is.   Basically, I think there are two approaches to this. The first could be called the ""purist"" approach, which wants to stay as true to JRRTs vision as possible. This is a noble goal, and I'd be all for it, except that it reduces the overall breadth of the world. The second approach is ""pragmatist,"" I guess. That's the one I detailed above; it's ok for someone else to add on to canon, since Tolkien can't anymore. As long as this is done in a judicious manner that stays as true to the legendarium as can be reasonably expected, personally I'm not going to get hung up on whether or not it's exactly what JRRT intended.   I don't have a problem treating Sil as canon, is basically what I'm trying to say. Cause the alternative is mostly just a void."
tolkienfans,36yejp,fearsomeduckins,2,Sun May 24 19:44:01 2015 UTC,I have several friends who sound like your mate.  I will be using this argument on them from now on.
tolkienfans,36yejp,eochaid1297,1 point,Sun May 24 19:52:16 2015 UTC,"The long lists of names, and people having multiple names, echoes the Norse mythology that partly inspired them. In the Poetic Edda there are stanzas that consist of just names for dwarves, and many of the names end up being used by Tolkien. Both Thorin and Oakenshield are names for dwarves in one of the poems.  Just about everyone has multiple names as well. They also use phrases such as ""the sons of Heimdall"" to refer to humans.  If you use the Chekov's gun argument everything should have a good reason to be part of the story and be meaningful later on. When the Balrog is called Durin's Bane it is sort of relevant since it explains his backstory, but when he is also called Flame of Udun by Gandalf without any explanation and it is then never brought up again, yeah, some people may not like it. But as you said, world-building, it is not just a series of plot elements written down in the most efficient way.  There are also things in LotR that may not make as much sense if you have not read the Silmarillion."

You'll need to code an autoreplacement function into the font to make it appear correctly while "" typing normally "". Otherwise one would need to use that mapped into capital letters, alt keys, etc. Another problem, but maybe one could tap into autoreplacement too, are sounds for which English uses more than one letter (sh, ch, etc). Also, to decide wether you want to go by English spelling (which I figure could be the easiest way to go) or phonetic transliteration.

tolkienfans,36o38m,ElvisShrugged,64,Wed May 20 20:11:25 2015 UTC,"Sauron fears the line of kings and he fears the blade that bit into him. This is a plot point early on in RotK.   'It was a bitter struggle, and the weariness is slow to pass. I spoke no word to him, and in the end I wrenched the Stone to my own will. That alone he will find hard to endure. And he beheld me. Yes, Master Gimli, he saw me, but in other guise than you see me here. If that will aid him, then I have done ill. But I do not think so. To know that I lived and walked the earth was a blow to his heart, I deem; for he know it not till now. The eyes in Orthanc did not see through the armor of Theoden; but Sauron has not forgotten Isildur and the sword of Elendil. Now in the very hour of his great designs the heir of Isildur and the Sword are revealed; for I showed the blade re-forged to him. He is not so might yet that he is above fear; nay, doubt ever gnaws him.'   -The Return of the King, 'The Passing of the Grey Company'  If the sword is reforged and wielded again, Sauron would focus his attention to it and the bearer. That would be bad."
tolkienfans,36o38m,Uluithiad,19,Wed May 20 20:46:25 2015 UTC,"This, I think, is the best explanation here. I'm more curious why Valandil or one of the subsequent kings (at least through Eärendur) wouldn't have considered it during the ~1000 years prior to Sauron's return. Did they have the foresight to come to this same conclusion, despite the feeling of safety in his defeat? Or was it something else?"

tolkienfans,36o38m,btaz,10,Wed May 20 21:58:48 2015 UTC,"He was Aragorn son of Arathorn, the nine and thirtieth heir in the right line from Isildur, and yet more like Elendil than any before him.   Probably partially has to do with this, the line of kings straying from its former glory and purpose. It could also be about timing. Aragorn taking his place as king would have come to nothing if the ring hadn't been found yet. So maybe other people before Aragorn had the opportunity to reforge the sword and reclaim the throne, but didn't because it wasn't the right time. Aragorn was a major source of doubt and fear for Sauron but Sauron would still have defeated him if not for the hobbits. Guess it all depends on to what extent the former kings knew or didn't know Sauron still existed which is beyond my knowledge."

tolkienfans,36o38m,otherwiseyep,46,Wed May 20 21:05:52 2015 UTC,"I don't think any of the answers here so far are precisely correct, and I don't think it's the kind of question that gets a bright-line answer in Tolkien's world.   Tolkien's Middle Earth is a time of myth, when things are done or not done for reasons that are different from how an economist's conception of a ""rational actor"" might act.   Nasril was preserved as a broken artifact partially for the same reasons that the USA preserves the cracked Liberty Bell, rather than repairing it, or why Italy does not update the Coliseum with modern amenities and new seats and a jumbotron. The historical value is greater than its practical utility.   Now, let's say that in some imaginary future, there were some second American Revolution. Maybe those future freedom fighters would choose to re-forge and re-polish the Liberty Bell, and turn it from a tarnished, cracked old relic into a brilliant and shining instrument of freedom, whose note will ring clear and true again...  It's important to understand that in Tolkien's world, ""elvish"" things that might seem ""magic"" to us, are not really ""magic"". Or at least, they are not meant to be differently ""magic"" than the pyramids, or the liberty bell, or a stradivarius or a '59 Les Paul... Elvish things are things made by people who have had thousands of years of practice. They can make ropes that seem to untie themselves, and swords that seem to shine when enemies are near, and so on, not through supernatural arts, but through greater skill and longer practice.   Same with the Numenoreans, and the things they made, or the Dwarves, and things they made. Just as a modern human craftsman with decades of experience can make remarkable objects, so could someone with hundreds or thousands of years experience create even greater works of art.  Narsil was such an object, made by a great dwarf craftsman, in an age when things were greater and purer and closer to God and the gods than they were in the time of LoTR. Like the Pyramids or Stonehenge or the statues of Easter Island, it is a thing from another age, and there is no immediately obvious reason to ""remake"" or ""repair"" it.   It was the return of Isildur's heir that prompted its re-forging, maybe how if some group of descendants of Easter Island decided to repopulate and restore their ancestral kingdom, they might dig up and restore the landmark statues. Until then, these things are artifacts."

tolkienfans,36o38m,Conchobair,11,Wed May 20 23:20:48 2015 UTC,"While we don't have a textual explanation, we can draw some decent inferences:   Both the fact and the way that Narsil was shattered carried great significance. Remember, Narsil was the sword of Elendil, direct descendant of Eärendil the Mariner, who was allowed to sail to Valinor and plead to the Valar for aid against Morgoth. That sword, Narsil, had been in Elendil's hand throughout the war against Morgoth's lieutenant, Sauron. So both sword and man were strongly bound to the struggle against darkness. But the sword was broken. A broken sword is a symbol of defeat, and indeed, Narsil was broken as Elendil died. (n.b. the movie has Sauron step on Narsil as Isildur reaches for it - it's not faithful to the text, but the image underscores how desperate that hour was, how certain Sauron's victory seemed). Isildur picks up the hilt-shard (there were only two) and swings a desperate stroke ... that manages somehow to snatch total victory from the maw of utter despair. So the broken Narsil is a reminder of a theme that comes up throughout LOTR: don't lose hope, even when the hour seems darkest. Narsil itself was forged by the Telchar, whose other great work was Angrist, the knife that cut a Silmaril from the Iron Crown of Morgoth. It's quite possible that the elves believed that it couldn't be reforged, since Telchar's smithing was clearly all manner of badass, and even if it could, the resulting blade would be mere shadow of its former self. Narsil was considered an heirloom of the House of Elros, the mortal brother of Elrond, who himself as herald of Gil-Galad was present when Narsil was shattered. It's not hard to imagine that Elrond became disillusioned by the weakness of Isildur and the breaking of the high kingship, which eventually led to the fall of the realms of Men in the North. Elrond possibly saw in the two shards of Narsil a reflection of the break between Gondor and Arnor, and foresaw a future in which they could be reunited under one strong ruler... if such a ruler could ever be found among the Sons of Elendil ever again.    tl;dr: the reforging of Narsil represents not only the remaking of a great weapon in the battle against evil, but a healing of the political break Sauron caused with Elendil's death and Isildur's temptation. It wasn't going to be done without a very good reason."

tolkienfans,36o38m,AwakenMirror,16,Wed May 20 22:39:45 2015 UTC,"Someone down voted you, but I believe you actually have a point. The top comment (at the moment) regarding the sword attracting the attention of Sauron is only relevant if Sauron were to actually learn that the sword was reforged (or, to be honest, even still exists). There's nothing in that explanation precluding the elves from reforging the sword and just hanging it up on a wall somewhere, waiting for a king to wield it.  That said, the Silmarillion makes strong mention that the elves, with their (near, except in situation of extreme injury) immortal status, view the passage of time with far less urgency than men. Elves have all the time in the world. This is why, when the Numenorians came about, Sauron feared them the most. While they didn't have immortality, they combined the best aspects of the two races. They had much of the elves power and understanding (to a point, as we know), but combined with the impetus of men. Sauron didn't fear the elves nearly as much because they didn't feel the need to make their world a better place today, they had all eternity to get the job done. In that sense, the elves were the ultimate procrastinators.  Additionally, the relationship the elves had with the one ring with it being lost was, shall we say, balanced? With the one ring still existing, their rings still held the power bestowed upon them to maintain their respective realms. But of course Sauron didn't have possession of the ring, so they were not being particularly bothered by many evil forces. With the one ring destroyed, their power would finally diminish, and being unable to maintain their realms (in the image of the realms of Valinor, as I've always interpreted it), they would be forced to leave.  In that sense, the elves didn't have a compelling reason to see to it that Sauron be destroyed. In fact, they were strongly incentivized not to see through the downfall of Sauron. This makes The Lord of the Rings an ever deeper swan-song of the elves, that they would even agree to help a mission which would result in their expulsion from what they've come to know as their home.  So Anduril was only reforged once Aragorn decided he would take up the mantle of king (which he decided in Rivendell, before they set off, unlike the movies). Elrond gave up a tremendous amount for this mission - his daughter, obviously, and his (now) home. And, like the loving mentor he was to Aragon (unlike the movies, which somewhat portrayed him as an ass towards Aragon), he gave him the tools necessary to make it all happen. Prior to that moment, however, he was in no rush to see it through.  And I believe that adequately explains why the elves didn't pre-reforge Anduril."

tolkienfans,36m5kq,Kookanoodles,14,Wed May 20 12:09:04 2015 UTC,"I think it's a good choice! (Heck, I may have suggested it.) My one word of warning is that the story really does dive right into an unfamiliar setting: it'll take you a little while to figure out the names and significance of people and places. Be sure to read Christopher Tolkien's introduction: it's a bit dry in places, but he makes at least some effort to explain the setting and context.  (My list of projects includes ""Write a short introduction to the setting for readers going straight to The Children of Hurin after LotR."" Unfortunately, it's a very long list.)  Short version: This story is set thousands of years before LotR, back when Sauron was just a servant of the original dark lord, Morgoth. It takes place in Beleriand, which was located west of the LotR map (before it sank into the sea). Beleriand is inhabited by two main groups of Elves: the Sindar (whose most important kingdom was the protected forest of Doriath) and the more recently arrived Noldor (called ""high elves"" in LotR; they founded a number of kingdoms). At the time of the story, humans had only recently arrived in Beleriand (two or three generations), and most of those were allied with various Elven realms; Hurin was one of their chief leaders. That should be enough to get you started."
tolkienfans,36m5kq,Steuard,3,Wed May 20 15:02:44 2015 UTC,Thank you! This book is next on my list and your introduction will hopefully help. So no Silmarillion first?
tolkienfans,36m5kq,Anne1407,11,Wed May 20 15:51:17 2015 UTC,"I personally love The Silmarillion. But among my friends (many of them avid fantasy readers) I'm in the minority: most people that I know who have read it say that it feels very dry (especially the early bits), almost like reading a history book or the Bible. Quite a few people start reading Silm., get a few chapters in, and just put it down.  On the other hand, The Children of Hurin really is a novel, and even if the setting is a bit unfamiliar its reading experience is a lot closer to The Hobbit and LotR than anything else Tolkien wrote about Middle-earth. (There are some pretty good stories in Unfinished Tales, too, including the original slightly less polished version of The Children of Hurin. I often recommend UT before Silm, too; just skip the ""First Age"" stories until after reading Silm.)"
tolkienfans,36m5kq,Steuard,3,Wed May 20 16:09:32 2015 UTC,I tried the Silm when I was about 10 or 11 years old and couldn't get through the first few chapters. Might try it again when I've finished the children of Hurin. Thanks a lot for the info!

I read it in my late teens and even then it was rough as hell.  EDIT: Wasn't trying to be disparaging.  Just suggesting that it's a book better suited for older ages.  Heck, Tolkien didn't even want people to read LotR until they were adults.  He thought many of the themes were too out of the range of children and that children would read it as merely an adventure story and not a people story.  I admit I missed most of that on my first read through as well.  Of course I got some of it, but what 13 year old understands, for example, Eowyn's love and lose and gender issues, etc.?  If LotR wasn't written for young kids, I can't imagine the Silm. being any easier."

Read The Hobbit at a fairly young age, moved up to LoTR and then it only seemed right to read The Silm, since that was (and is) the only other Tolkien book my dad had that was in Dutch, and my English was by no means good enough to read Tolkien books. But I'll give it another shot. My dad loves The Silm so I should at least try to read it once more."

Silmarillion has a different pacing though, it reads more like a history book, or maybe even a religious text. Starts with the creation of the world and tells the history up to and including LotR. Has lots of Elves."

tolkienfans,36m5kq,Anne1407,2,Wed May 20 18:17:40 2015 UTC,"The first bit can be a bit boring, the creation story and the singing. It gets much more interesting when the Elves show up. Silm also provides a back story for many characters of LotR, and some of them have a role in it themselves. It is also much darker than LotR, not really meant for 10 year olds.  The tone of the Silmarillion reminds me a bit of the chapter in The Fellowship, the Council of Elrond. When they arrive in Rivendell Elrond tells the Hobbits (and by extension the reader) about the history of Middle-earth. He mentions a great host was assembled to fight Sauron, but not as great as the host of the Valar that assaulted Thangorodrim.  LotR also has songs about Eärendil and Luthien, their stories are also in the Silmarillion."

I reread The Hobbit and LoTR lately and now that I'm older, I find that there are many parts I don't think I fully understand without knowing more of the background.  I also found some information about History of Middle Earth series? They are not for sale here in the book store so I'd have to order them. Are they worth it to understand Middle Earth and LoTR better? They seem interesting but are far from cheap, so I'm having doubts..."
tolkienfans,36m5kq,Anne1407,1 point,Wed May 20 23:44:27 2015 UTC,"The History of Middle-earth are not really books that tell a story, they are detailing how the story came together by examining early drafts of them. I have never read them myself though, but I suspect it is pretty dry reading unless you really want to read several unfinished drafts of the same story.  I think it would be more useful to read the Silmarillion, and then re-read LotR. Silmarillion has background on some of the main characters and their ancestors, explains a lot about the Elves and Dúnedain. You will understand a bit more of some of the history mentioned. And rereading is also interesting just because you will understand the foreshadowing you didn't get when reading it the first time, Frodo's dreams at Tom Bombadil's place for example. When you read it the first time you have likely forgotten the foreshadowing by the time you get to read about the actual events.  It may be interesting to read some of the inspirations of Tolkien, such as Norse mythology and the Kalevala (Finnish mythology). These are all old so there are bunch of free translations floating around. I read a part of the Poetic Edda and in one poem it contained nearly all of the names of the Dwarves, and also the name Gandalf. Quite a few names are taken from it. There is also sometimes a similar tone in how prophecies work, the Last Battle (called Ragnarök in Norse mythology), Bilbo's riddle is cheating in a similar way that Odin cheats in a game of riddles.  The Norse mythology is under Icelandic here, there are also public domain versions of other world mythologies.  http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/ice/index.htm  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalevala"

tolkienfans,36hzci,sethandtheswan,26,Tue May 19 15:03:27 2015 UTC,"I never thought of it as they couldn't have children, they just didn't.    Why would they?  They are immortal and they have Maia, who are like children to them, and their whole point of exiting is to look after the Children of Ilúvatar.    I think that Tolkien started the idea of a Valar family tree, because that is just what he did.  Every other race and almost all the important characters fit into a family tree somewhere.    He later realized that it didn't make a lot of sense and so abandoned it."
tolkienfans,36hzci,Oilfan94,13,Tue May 19 15:30:10 2015 UTC,"The Valar didn't have classical 'children' in the Roman/Grecian pantheon sense, though Tolkien toyed with this idea differently at times.  The Valar had close followers and minions. Uinen and Osse had Ulmo as their 'parent', Eönwë was a vassal of Manwe, etc. There's also specific 'children' mentioned in the cases of Aule's dwarves, Yavanna's Ents, or Morgoth's orcs.   Morgoth specifically seemed quite keen to create children. Trolls and dragons and orcs should be considered his 'children' for all purposes, while balrogs and maia like Sauron are also close analogs. I think the closest he ever got to real children may have been ominous allusions at taking Luthien for his own:   Then Morgoth looking upon her beauty conceived in his thought an evil lust, and a design more dark than any that had yet come into his heart since he fled from Valinor. Thus he was beguiled by his own malice, for he watched her, leaving her free for awhile, and taking secret pleasure in his thought.    I've always assumed this to reference a union and mini-morgoth child.  I think the Valar's true 'children' were the elves and the maiar, Manwe's eagles, and why not every beast and bird created by Yavanna. Basically every thing that lives in Middle Earth could be considered a child of one Valar or another - except Men - who seem to be the children of Illuvatar alone."
tolkienfans,36hzci,Mycd,1 point,Tue May 19 16:20:06 2015 UTC,"I'd say the Elves and Men are Children of Iluvatar, not the Valar. Although if the Valar are the offspring of Iluvatar's thought and then they are Iluvatar in some  sense, maybe?  Then they Elve's and men would be the children of the valar. I see the Elves and men more as younger siblings or distant cousins to the Valar. The Valar are very curious about elves and men in a way because they will help the Valar to better understand Iluvatar. That seems a strange sort of attitude to have towards ones children, at least to me."
tolkienfans,36hzci,piejesudomine,7,Sat May 23 08:06:02 2015 UTC,"You are forgetting that only Melkor of the Valar took on permanent physical form in order to be able to have greater power of the physical world. The other Valar wore only fana, which was as clothing to us. Melian was able to conceive a child with one of the Eldar only because she made a permanent physical form.  As for Melkor, i think that in the earlier works Gothmog was supposed to be his child (not it the published Silmarillion of course)."
tolkienfans,36hzci,Devouringvoid,3,Tue May 19 19:22:49 2015 UTC,"There are a couple different aspects to the answer to this, but it's late for me so I'm only going to mention one. Tolkien was a big fan of exceptions to the general rule. Things always work a certain way, except in the one case where they don't (such as Luthien, an elf who gets to become mortal, and so on). Now, Melian isn't a Vala, so Valar rules don't necessarily apply, and obviously because she does do it she can do it, but even if the rule was that generally it can't happen (though I'd be more inclined to say doesn't happen rather than can't happen) there is still likely to be an exception to that general rule."
tolkienfans,36hzci,fearsomeduckins,2,Tue May 19 16:03:39 2015 UTC,"Melian isn't a Vala, so Valar rules don't necessarily apply   Maiar and Valar have the same nature, so I imagine the same 'rules' (ie natural possibilities & impossibilities) do apply. I do agree with Tolkien liking exceptions and exceptional characters though."
tolkienfans,36hzci,doegred,2,Tue May 19 16:50:58 2015 UTC,"Tolkien describes this in his essay Osanwe-Kenta, which is unfortunately only found in the Vinyar Tengwar linguistics journal.  The Valar and Maiar can incarnate in a hroa (body) at will, and normally put it off at will.  However:   Pengolodh also cites the opinion that if a ""spirit"" (that is, one of those not embodied by creation) uses a hroa for the furtherance of its personal purposes, or (still more) for the enjoyment of bodily faculties, it finds it increasingly difficult to operate without the hroa.  The things that are most binding are those that in the Incarnate have to do with the life of the hroa itself, its sustenance and its propagation.  Thus eating and drinking are binding, but not the delight in beauty of sound or form.  Most binding is begetting or conceiving."
tolkienfans,36hzci,Evan_Th,1 point,Thu May 21 02:06:44 2015 UTC,"As Oilfan94 says, what seems to have been abandoned is the idea that the Valar married each other and had children with each other. Melian's example is with a mortal, and she incarnates herself. It seems likely that the Valar could have had children with each other had they wanted to, but the old concept was likely motivated by elements of Norse and Greek mythology. Tolkien seems to have slowly increased the elements of Christianity in his mythology and reduced the amount of ""pagan"" mythology (although both were always present).  I'm not aware of any writing where he discusses the philosophical elements of the Valar and childbirth, but there may be something in Morgoth's Ring I'm forgetting."

If you want something specific, you basically have four choices: Smaug, Glaurung, Ancalagon, or Scatha. (Or you could try to illustrate some other specific scene, maybe from the Fall of Gondolin, but the weird mecha-dragons of the Lost Tales aren't really the same thing.) And we don't get any particularly vivid descriptions of Scatha at all.  Meanwhile, when Gandalf describes how the Rings of Power could be destroyed by dragon-fire, he specifically notes that ""not even Ancalagon the Black"" could have harmed the One. So even folks who have just read LotR will know that Ancalagon was exceptional. Combine that with Ancalagon's brief but climactic scene in The Silmarillion, and there's enough to base some fun art on."

tolkienfans,36g2wj,Fornad,-1,Tue May 19 14:37:27 2015 UTC,You should also recall that this is a war where the whole of Beleriand was broken. Why should we assume one particular part of the destruction demands perfect accountability in our modern understanding of physics if we don't assume any of the rest of it does?
tolkienfans,36g2wj,Uluithiad,14,Tue May 19 17:07:49 2015 UTC,"But there's nothing to suggest that he wasn't huge and a few things to suggest that he was. Like Smaug, Ancalagon seemed to draw his might from physical combat, and Smaug does mention the whole ""my claws are spears' bit, which indicates that his sheer physical size would have aided him in battle. Therefore if Ancalagon was the mightiest that ever lived one can assume that he was larger than Smaug and perhaps very large indeed."
tolkienfans,36g2wj,Fornad,-2,Tue May 19 06:06:01 2015 UTC,"There is a very wide distance between 'larger than Smaug' and 'bloody huge', especially when we are talking about fanart, which tends to portray Ancalagon as hundreds of times the size of Smaug.  By the way, 'my claws spears' is not really talking about size, or only incidentally so. The claim isn't 'my claws [are the size of] spears, but 'my claws [have the force of] spears, since it goes along with similar things like 'my teeth are swords', 'the shock of my tail a thunderbolt', 'my wings a hurricane', and 'my breath death'. Most of those don't work if you take the particular figurative bent you've chosen."
tolkienfans,36g2wj,Uluithiad,10,Tue May 19 07:18:19 2015 UTC,"hundreds of times the size   I think those portrayals are as silly as you must do. However given the whole narrative bent of Tolkien's universe, I'm which everything is decaying from being magical (to the point of mythology) to the mundane mortal world we have today, surely it is not unreasonable to imagine that this mightiest of dragons, who pushed back the Host of the West by virtue of his own might, was much bigger than Smaug? It took a mortal man with a special arrow to kill Smaug, whereas it took the Eagles and Ëarendil upon his flying ship to kill Ancalagon.  I suppose he might have had some other source of power, but it's never hinted at. The might of dragons seems to be based largely on their physical size and therefore the destructive power that results from it."
tolkienfans,36g2wj,Fornad,1 point,Tue May 19 07:26:55 2015 UTC,"who pushed back the Host of the West by virtue of his own might   This did not happen. Please read the source material and stop making gross exaggerations of what is there. That's the whole problem with this topic. People read the one to two sentences, want more, and let them jostle around in their minds until they've constructed a narrative that suits them, not something that reflects the text."
tolkienfans,36g2wj,Uluithiad,3,Tue May 19 11:05:49 2015 UTC,"But he loosed upon his foes the last desperate assault that he had prepared, and out of the pits of Angband there issued the winged dragons, that had not before been seen; and so sudden and ruinous was the onset of that dreadful fleet that the host of the Valar was driven back, for the coming of the dragons was with great thunder, and lightning, and a tempest of fire... Before the rising of the sun Eärendil slew Ancalagon the Black, the mightiest of the dragon-host, and cast him from the sky; and he fell upon the towers of Thangorodrim, and they were broken in his ruin. Then the sun rose, and the host of the Valar prevailed, and well-nigh all the dragons were destroyed...   From this quote, I take it that Ancalagon's defeat allowed the Host of the Valar to defeat the dragon-host as a whole, which suggests to me that Ancalagon's might must have been very great indeed."
tolkienfans,36g2wj,AmbiguousAnonymous,6,Tue May 19 17:33:26 2015 UTC,"The problem is when your impressions are used when the text says something else completely. Like it does here, because:   and out of the pits of Angband there issued the winged dragons, that had not before been seen; and so sudden and ruinous was the onset of that dreadful fleet that the host of the Valar was driven back, for the coming of the dragons was with great thunder, and lightning, and a tempest of fire.   What drove the host of the Valar back? The onset of the fleet of winged dragons. Why? Because their arrival was sudden and ruinous. (The whole flying bit likely helped, too). How were they overcome? You've clipped much of this from your quote, but 'there was battle in the air all the day and through the dark night of doubt' between the host of dragons and Earendil and Thorondor and 'all the great birds of heaven'.  So why was the host of dragons vanquished after Ancalagon was destroyed? You assume it was because he was far and away the greatest of them, that he was so great that without him they were trivial. But this is not what Tolkien says. Ancalagon is not even mentioned until after the dragons as a whole are said to drive the Valar back. There's a full day and night of fighting going on before Ancalagon is slain. Are we to suppose he was the only one killed during this time? Doubtful, especially if he is the mightiest. Maybe the host failed after he died because most of them were already dead, and then he, the champion, followed suit. Maybe he was the military commander, and their rout with the rising sun had to do with a sudden lack of tactical direction. Hell, maybe Morgoth himself was the military commander, and the roof above his head coming down had his control waver, not unlike the Battle of the Black Gate. I am not suggesting any particular one of these, merely pointing out that it is a bit silly to demand a particular explanation, and even more silly to use the fruits of that demand to plant an orchard and harvest a whole new year of fruit.  The only reason to think him so great as you do is that you want to think him so great as you do. You read the text with a particular slant to your imagination, and the lack of details allows you to find it possible. But OP's whole question was about how people run wild with Ancalagon. Can you not see how answering the question about Ancalagon's popularity with things you've come up with on your own because you, personally, are a part of that popularity movement, sorts of defeats the purpose?  There is no more evidence that Ancalagon is far and away singularly large or powerful or hot. He is the most powerful dragon. He is the hottest dragon. He may be the largest dragon. But where is the evidence that any of these are acting on different orders of magnitude? The only possible one to argue is with power, if you use the argument of 'great foes die greatly' to assume the wreck of Thangorodrim in his death indicates he was far and away the mightest. But then you have absolutely nothing to speak to size. Which brings me back the original point about all the fans thinking Ancalagon to be bloody huge is a bunch of nonsense."

The is given to us by Tolkien, we don't need to make up some notion of divine/godly energies to make sense of it, we're told clearly that it is there. What's left to the imagine is the extent of it.  For Ancalagon all we know is his status as mightiest of dragons, and the abilities of dragons in general. So when he breaks mountains in his fall, it isn't nonsense to assume that we are indeed meant to ponder it's size.  Argue one way of another, it's all fun discourse, but writing it off as nonsense is unwarranted."
tolkienfans,36g2wj,flukshun,5,Tue May 19 20:34:12 2015 UTC,"You are thinking of a different battle. The War of Wrath contained very few of the Valar, perhaps on Tulkas, and some number of Maiar that is never specified. Their host was mostly Elves. This is not the same force as the Battle of the Powers. This is the War of Wrath. The devastation visited upon Beleriand is more confined and more severe than the devastation visited upon Middle-earth during earlier battles.  But wait... what exactly is your point here? That we can ignore physics when Tolkien says the gods are fighting, but because Ancalagon is not a god, we have to assume that his own combat doesn't have impacts on a mythological scale? How is that supposed to make any sense at all? On what grounds do you get to demand those particulars?"
tolkienfans,36g2wj,Uluithiad,2,Tue May 19 16:14:10 2015 UTC,"You are thinking of a different battle. The War of Wrath contained very few of the Valar, perhaps on Tulkas, and some number of Maiar that is never specified.   I think you're right, I had images of Tulkas wrestling Morgoth down. But Eonwe was there to bound and humble Morgoth, and probably other powers as well, enough to match a god at least.  To me at least it seemed clear that we weren't to attribute the reshaping to any natural force of destruction, but rather something akin to the shaping of Middle-Earth, sinking of Numenor, the Lonely Island ferry, etc. There's no reason to make any strange jumps from the history/details available to us."
tolkienfans,36g2wj,RisenDesert,5,Tue May 19 17:39:42 2015 UTC,"Tulkas may have been at the War of Wrath. It's very unclear, since Tolkien, frankly, never wrote a real narrative of it. He's certainly present in the earliest scraps of notes and mapping related to it. But Tulkas, the Wrestler, always came across to me as one of the most direct of the Valar in combat. At the very least, all of the world-warping in the Battle of the Powers is mentioned before he fights Melkor mano a mano and Melkor is set in chains. Even if we do consider him to be around and about in the War of Wrath, we can't level all that destruction at his feet. Or, in my opinion, any large part of it."

Of course I did really want to see Tom Bombadil and the Scouring of the Shire, but it's very clear why these were not included.  If I was a director / producer and trying to keep the theatrical releases to under 4 hours, these were two obvious choices.  They didn't even get the chance to be on the cutting room floor, they were just never shot.  The whole Arwen subplot seemed very shoe-horned and contrived and I think it was clearly done for demographic reasons. Maybe it paid off, I don't know.  I'm not such a fanboy to not appreciate growing the appeal of the genre.  I'm just lamenting the screen time dedicated to that character (and that actress) while omitting true source material.  A lot of what I missed was added back into the extended DVDs (the Mouth of Sauron for example).  The Hobbit movies, by contrast, are terrible terrible terrible adaptations.  There's really nothing new to say here that hasn't already been said.

In the novels, Arwen is mentioned at the Council of Elrond, and at Aragorn and her's marriage. Pages are dedicated to Eowyn and her fondness for Aragorn, but you don't get a sense of how important Arwen is from the main narrative.

To add some positivity I'll list a few things that matched my vision very well.  The shire. Almost exactly how I pictured it.  Hobbits, Dwarves, and Men were all done well (excepting the necessary ""prettiness"" of actors).  The pass of Caradhras.  The brief encounter with the Elves heading to the Grey Havens.

tolkienfans,36cslc,Nichase,12,Mon May 18 18:50:00 2015 UTC,Agreed.  But the filmmakers show natural grasslands with no evidence if there being any fields or buildings.  Its like that city just sits in isolation.  It lacks context to make it feel like more of a real living and breathing world.

And it wasn't just ruining Faramir's character. That scene in Osgiliath where a Nazgul comes and Frodo ends up holding the Ring out for the Nazgul to take...that was cringeworthy."
tolkienfans,36cslc,ScallopOolong,20,Tue May 19 06:32:26 2015 UTC,"I read the books about a million times before seeing the movies. Going in to see the Fellowship the first time I worried, even expected it would be a mess. Maybe it will be enjoyable anyway, I told myself, but probably it will have a thousand things ""wrong"".  I came out surprised and pleased with how good it was. The things it got right felt very right, even beyond what I had imagined. And the things it got wrong were mostly either understandable (like skipping the Old Forest, Bombadil, and Barrow Wights) or not a big deal. Still, my Tolkien fan friends and I could list a thousand little details that had struck us while watching. Like, just offhand, I didn't like the bit where they get stuck in the snow on Redhorn Pass and have to decide between going on or trying Moria and Gandalf says ""let the Ringbearer decide"". Frodo says Moria, so they go to Moria. Um, Frodo has no special knowledge here (just the opposite really), first of all. Second, why burden him with this decision? Third, why not have Aragorn and Gandalf disagree, complete with Aragorn warning Gandalf about Moria? Other minor things from that part of the movie include having Saruman explicitly causing the storm and avalanche on Caradhras, and having the Ring on its chain somehow slip off Frodo's neck into the snow, with Boromir picking it up. Okay, I guess the last one is understandable for making Boromir's story work in movie form, but it still felt rather heavy-handed and clunky as a plot device.  Anyway, there were a million little things like these. A friend even pointed out something I had missed and didn't even know was a thing at all. She said ""Tolkien would never have said 'from whence'"", as Gandalf does when explaining how to destroy the Ring. In the book Gandalf doesn't say 'whence' at all in that chapter (Shadows of the Past), but there are plenty of 'whences' elsewhere in the books, and true enough, Tolkien never says 'from whence'.  Now that might be an exceptionally minor point, and overall I was impressed with how much of the dialogue was word-for-word from the books. But here and there they simplified the wording in non-Tolkien-like ways. Nowadays, after the movies, there are many quotes said to be from Tolkien that are not in the books. Like Galadriel saying ""Even the smallest person can change the course of the future."" On the Internet this quote is widely attributed to Tolkien and said to be Galadriel's words. Peter Jackson, or one of the scriptwriters anyway, gave these words to Galadriel based on something Elrond said: ""This quest may be attempted by the weak with as much hope as the strong. Yet such is oft the course of deeds that move the wheels of the world: small hands do them because they must, while the eyes of the great are elsewhere."" Jackson often simplified dialogue, and moved things from scene to scene or person to person. Usually it was fine, even good. But this particular case ""replaces the literary tone of the original with a contemporary cliché"", as Michael Drout put it.  Speaking of Drout, I agree with his analysis of the movies. There are four main types of changes: abridgement (no Bombadil), compression (eg Éowyn in general), transformation (Galadriel's quote above, or Gandalf talking about Gollum and pity in Moria instead of Bag End), and addition. This last category turned out by far the worst. Example: Gandalf and Saruman's ""telekinesis fight"" in Orthanc. In a few cases the additions turned out quite good, like the lighting of the beacons of Gondor, as Drout points out. Although even there, while I found the scene epic and moving, I thought it rather silly to have some of the beacons way up on the tops of towering, glacier-clad mountains. It looked awesome, sure, but come on, Gondor really keeps men in such places, watching 24/7, with beacons ready to light at a moment's notice? It's an awesome looking scene, but also ridiculous. Maybe a better addition, to my mind, is the start of the Two Towers, with the beautiful opening of the Misty Mountains, the sudden zooming in to the Balrog scene and the following of Gandalf down into the abyss. That was awesome.  Anyway, I could go on and on, but other people have commented on most of the really key points. The ruining of Faramir, the way each movie was a bit worse in the the use of bad wholesale alterations and additions (but for me the first movie was key, since I feared it would be bad; the second and third were more or less as I expected, having seen the first one). The excellence of some of the casting choices (Sam, Gandalf, Boromir), and the questionableness of others (Frodo way way too young). The awesomeness of the Balrog (though I hated how they made Gandalf cling to the bridge for a quiet moment to whisper ""fly you fools"" before seeming to just let go).  I'll end this too-long comment by mentioning the scene I used to most clearly imagine being made into a movie, long before Jackson. For whatever reason I always had a particularly clear picture of the scene where Frodo, Sam, and Gollum watch the Lord of the Nazgul lead his army out of Minas Morgul. They are hiding on the stairs nearby. The Nazgul is on horseback and as he crosses the river bridge he stops and holds up his hand, sensing Frodo or the Ring or whatever. He looks around a little but lets it pass and continues on, leading his army to war. I knew the movie would not do that scene the way I imagined it, since I had imagined it so clearly the odds were basically zero. I didn't expect that they would not even have the Nazgul at the head of the army, on horseback. I was prepared to be let down, so it didn't bother me much. And I understand why they chose to put the Nazgul on a fell beast instead of a horse (and anyway, when you think about it it is odd that he starts on horseback but later, in the battle, arrives on a fell beast—what, does Sauron have spare fell beasts waiting around at strategic places??). Still, this is a scene I will always picture most clearly the way I pictured it before the movies. I am happy to reject the movie version in my head. Other scenes I had pictured clearly but differently, like the Balrog, I can still picture in my head, but don't mind so much having the movie version mixed in there too."
tolkienfans,36cslc,ScallopOolong,7,Mon May 18 22:06:33 2015 UTC,"Wow, the best comment out there, congrats. Although you have been quite picky xD"
tolkienfans,36cslc,ScallopOolong,6,Mon May 18 22:35:29 2015 UTC,"Thanks. Maybe I should say I really liked the movies, and I could have also pointed out a million little things I really liked about them. I began by saying I went to see the first film worried, even expecting it to be pretty bad, but was very pleased with it. I definitely got sidetracked into picky details while writing above.  Well, on the specific OP questions....   How different was Minas Tirith, or Mordor?   Both were very much as I had imagined. Actually it took me a long time to get a clear idea of Minas Tirith, and when I did it mostly came from The Atlas of Middle-earth and Alan Lee paintings. I know some people pictured farmlands around the city, but I always pictured it as a flat grassy plain. I think Tolkien mentions the area as having been ""townlands"" and farms, but that it had been emptied and cleared due to the war. I do like the idea of it being more rolling than flat, and with houses and farms at least at the time Gandalf visited to search the archive/library. There's some nice Ted Nasmith paintings of different visions, like this one and this other one. But I didn't see those until after seeing the movie. The movie version conformed to what I had imagined very well.  Same with Mordor, mostly. Aside from the giant eyeball the Black Tower was better than I had imagined—although it is generally shown too close to Mount Doom and the Black Gate. The geography of Mordor as a whole was ""compressed"" in the movies, with everything much closer together. That the Black Tower is visible at all goes against what I had imagined. In the books it is usually described as veiled in shadows and such, if I remember right. So I had mostly pictured it as something massive but shadowy, which you only get a brief glimpse of. Certainly it was not visible from the last battle at the Black Gate—but still I liked how the movie made it, and Sauron's spotlight eye visible during that battle. It made the point of that battle clear, to distract Sauron, in a way that worked visually. Also, the way Sauron's spotlight attention wavered when Frodo claimed the Ring, then shifted to Mount Doom, was well done. It wasn't how I had pictured it, but that was an aspect of the books that simply doesn't lend itself to a direct cinematic portrayal.  The Black Gate was more or less as I had pictured. I didn't mind that they left out the ""second Black Gate"", Isenmouthe. Same with the desolation before the Black Gate, the mountains that enclose Mordor, and the landscape of Ithilien. The Stairs of Cirith Ungol and the Tower of Cirith Ungol were better than I had pictured. Minas Morgul and Shelob's Lair were not as I had imagined. Minas Morgul I found acceptable but kinda meh. Shelob's Lair was a disaster of a set. On other places, Edoras was exactly as I imagined, although I was definitely influenced by Alan Lee paintings. The Shire was great. Rivendell was done in a lovely way, but not at all how I pictured it. I'd imagined it more like this (an Alan Lee painting I think). And I think that is much closer to how Tolkien described it. The sprawling, somewhat gothic complex built over waterfalls thing is cool looking, but a bit too much like something out of Skyrim. But I'm getting picky again.   How different were the faces and acting of the protagonists?   The faces of people were mostly very good. Some characters I had never pictured very clearly and the movie nailed, like Sam. When reading the books now I picture Sam as he is in the movies and am happy with that. Merry I'm okay with. Pippin...well the actor did a good job but I picture Pippin as much younger, and more carefree happy, less doofus-like. Aragorn wasn't quite how I pictured him, but I quite liked. I didn't have a clear picture of Saruman, and while Christopher Lee wasn't quite what I had imagined he did such a great job. Theoden I imagined as much much older, with a great white beard. They nailed Smeagol.  PS edit: I think what I was trying to say in the first comment was that despite a thousand little things, like the ones I pointed out, I was mostly okay with them, and found my expectations far surpassed."

tolkienfans,36cslc,ScallopOolong,2,Tue May 19 03:59:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks! And yea, Sam and Frodo's adventure, from Emyn Muil to Mount Doom, is all excellent. I have to say though that their route through Mordor, after Cirith Ungol, confused me for quite a while. I first read the books when I was about 10, and I did a terrible job reading—skipping over whole chapters if they got boring. I was quite confused on a number of points. I reread it off and on through my teens and got a much clearer idea of things. But on Frodo and Sam's route after Cirith Ungol it wasn't until I got The Atlas of Middle-earth that I realized how circuitous it was—how they couldn't get over the Morgai ridge and were forced north to Isenmouthe. It's all there in the book, but I guess as a teenager I just didn't read carefully enough to get the geography down right.  On geography, it didn't help that the maps in the books I had as a kid did not show where Isengard was. I remember being very confused about where it was when I first read the books. For all I knew Isengard was in Mordor, thanks to my bad 10 year old reading style. I figured it out before long, but I still laugh at myself for being so confused the first time."
tolkienfans,36cslc,rumdiary,88,Tue May 19 07:16:08 2015 UTC,"Overall I was thrilled with the LOTR films.  I had read The Hobbit five times, The LOTR twice and The Silmarillion once before the films were released and there is a history of reading LOTR in my family since my Grandparents, who grew up in Wiltshire where Tolkien grew up.  I felt that The Fellowship of the Ring was truly exceptional in how close it was to my experience of reading the book (not counting the fact they ignore Tom Bombadil of course).  Even the scenes which showcase some of Peter Jackson's directorial carte blanche (ie. Gandalf making a boat in pipe-smoke) were in fact really fitting and perfect in my opinion.  The Balrog at the end was handled brilliantly, much better than I even had in my imagination, which is very high praise.  The Two Towers was also handled well, but not as much as Fellowship, and The Return of the King started to decline a little bit more, and now The Hobbit moves aren't even ""canon"", they're just a joke in my opinion.  The LOTR trilogy, to quote Hunter S Thompson, ""was a very special place and time to be a part of"".  My entire 30-strong family spanning 3 generations got together to watch them each Christmas, three years running."

tolkienfans,36cslc,FaerieStories,2,Tue May 19 04:24:03 2015 UTC,"Well, maybe 'giants that can be mistaken for trees' was a little misleading. What I meant was: they are tree-ish, but they're less like a walking log than PJ depicted them."
tolkienfans,36cslc,Zankou55,7,Tue May 19 05:38:50 2015 UTC,"Nope.  Treebeard:  [A] large Man-like, almost Troll-like, figure, at least fourteen foot high, very sturdy, with a tall head, and hardly any neck. Whether it was clad in stuff like green and grey bark, or whether that was its hide, was difficult to say. At any rate the arms, at a short distance from the trunk, were not wrinkled, but covered with a brown smooth skin. The large feet had seven toes each. The lower part of the long face was covered with a sweeping grey beard, bushy, almost twiggy at the roots, thin and mossy at the ends. But at the moment the hobbits noted little but the eyes. These deep eyes were now surveying them, slow and solemn, but very penetrating.  best picture I could find online:  http://img-fan.theonering.net/~rolozo/images/sweet/entmoot.jpg  Even those Ents are two Tree-ish, IMO."
tolkienfans,36cslc,ScallopOolong,4,Tue May 19 02:10:48 2015 UTC,"I imagined Treebeard to look more like that Alan Lee painting posted above, and/or like in the movies. Maybe not quite that treeish, but not at all like that entmoot.jpg picture. Tolkien's description is quite vague and can, I think, be interpreted in many ways. It is clear that once you looked closely enough you'd know he isn't a tree, but he looked enough like a tree that Merry and Pippin thought he was, even while hanging out right next to him.  Then there's all the little bits about how he can barely bend, how he sleeps standing up with his arms raised and stretched out, etc.  I'm not saying what is right, just what I had imagined before the movies (and still imagine now). That said, I always found it hard to picture Treebeard and the other Ents. The way Tolkien describes them feels somewhat contradictory, both tree-like and Man/Troll-like. I always had a hard time putting it all together and have never been entirely satisfied with any painting, drawing, or movie version."

tolkienfans,36cslc,rumanchu,15,Mon May 18 10:43:35 2015 UTC,"I had already seen the Bakshi movie and the Rankin-Bass cartoons by the time that I read the books for the first time (I remember having to take a nap in order to be allowed to stay up to watch Return of the King; I was six), so my visualizations of the characters in the books were very much influenced by the casting choices of the cartoon versions.  (For me, Gandalf has always sounded like John Huston).  With that said, I was (overall) very pleased with the Jackson movies.  The two biggest exceptions that I can think of:   Gimli - I just can't shake the feeling that he comes across as something of a goof in the movies, while I always felt that he was something of a badass when I first read the books. The damn ""wearing the ring"" visual effect, while striking, just seems ridiculous to me.  When Frodo first puts the ring on in the Prancing Pony my immediate thought was that there was just no damn way that Bilbo would have worn the ring for as long as he did in the Hobbit if it was like that every time.  Since my initial viewing I've come to believe that (in the movie universe) the effect of wearing the ring must have become more intense as Sauron has regained his powers.   Obviously I had some concerns about the removal of certain portions of the books, but I could understand most of them.  It still bothers me that the Scouring of the Shire was removed, but if there's one thing that the movies didn't need, it was yet another reason to extend the ending."

tolkienfans,36cslc,matthumph,4,Mon May 18 12:08:08 2015 UTC,Gandalf in the books looked a lot more like Saruman in the films in my mind (I know Sir Christopher Lee was considered for Gandalf).   Maybe that was just the illustration on the cover of the version I had though.
tolkienfans,36cslc,wjbc,4,Mon May 18 15:26:56 2015 UTC,"There's not a single scene I can think of which is exactly as it was described in the books -- and yet, there are only a few scenes which have no relationship to the books whatsoever.  The differences are too numerous to list, although attempts have been made.    But the biggest difference of all is the emphasis on action and the de-emphasis of serious spiritual and almost theological themes (except that Tolkien buried any explicit reference to religion) found in the books.  Tolkien wrote a spiritual epic, a journey of the soul, and spiced it up with action.  Jackson focused on the action and placed the spiritual themes firmly in the background."
tolkienfans,36cslc,mutokangius,8,Mon May 18 17:56:21 2015 UTC,"While reading the Lord of the Rings and considering Tolkien's source material (late iron age sagas) I always imagined the whole setting as having a much more early medieval look. The movies have, instead, more of an early renaissance look, with plate mail and a lot of baroque designs. I always pictured things as looking more like a Viking Age story; chainmail, yes, plate mail no. Most of the architecture in the LOTR movies has a more high medieval feel to it, like cathedrals and flying buttresses and stuff, whereas I was picturing more simple structures like wooden mead halls, etc. This isn't based off of anything hard and fast from the text, just a general 'feeling' I got. I think this high medieval/early renaissance look was good for the elves and some of the Gondor stuff, but kind of inappropriate for, say, Rohan.  To be honest I don't love the movies but I think they did a decent job overall besides that big, to me, era error. Of course I also haven't seen the movies since they were originally in theaters too, so I could be misremembering things.  Also, I've always felt that not including the Scouring of the Shire was a bit of an Orwellian decision. Not including it kind of changes the whole tone of the ending of the story and, in my opinion, weakens the anti-war message of the entire tale. And not including Tom Bombadil or, more generally, many of the more lighthearted parts of the books was a big disappointment to me as well. People always say ""but how were they supposed to adapt it into a movie effectively with all that?"" and it's like... well... that's not my problem I'm not a film director who decided to adapt Lord of the Rings! But if you're going to do something, you should do it right, and changing the ending so dramatically is not a proper adaptation in my opinion.  As a side rant I also think that Tom Bombadil is something of an important character as his ability to wear the ring without being effected by it gives you a sense that there are yet things older and more powerful than Rings or even Melkor. And, Tom Bombadil suggests the idea that things are not always what they seem, and that those who seem weak may actually be the strongest of all. Two major themes in the Lord of the Rings...  I don't think he's an inconsequential character nor is his placement in the story an accident."
tolkienfans,36cslc,AragornElessar123,4,Mon May 18 16:08:52 2015 UTC,"Yup, LOTR is defiinitely and anglo Saxon/dark ages feel, not late medieval. I mean The soldiers of gondor should have worn mail with a small bit of plate, not all plate armour."
tolkienfans,36cslc,mutokangius,4,Mon May 18 22:13:32 2015 UTC,I agree. I always thought of Gondor as like the Byzantine Empire to Numenor's Roman Empire. A society in decline.

tolkienfans,36cslc,kentrel,3,Mon May 18 19:51:48 2015 UTC,"I don't remember having too strong a visual picture of Middle Earth. My imagination doesn't really paint the scene like a movie might. I remember the strength of the characters, and one scene that stood out for me the most was Sam telling Frodo goodbye after he was stabbed by Shelob. I never put any thought into what various places might look like, because it doesn't really for the plot.   When I eventually saw the films I remember being disappointed by the fake looking CGI. There's so much obvious CGI and real world lighting mismatches that it overrides any good photography in the scene.   But you forgive it because the characters were strong, well performed and the music was great."
tolkienfans,36cslc,dr_amy_bishop,3,Mon May 18 21:36:50 2015 UTC,"How different were the faces and acting of the protagonists?   Merry and Pippin looked older than I visualized them as. Aragorn and Boromir were much less physically imposing than they're described in the books, but for some reason this bothered me more for Viggo than for Sean (I think Viggo's costume accentuated his lack of chest muscle in a way Sean's didn't).    How different was Minas Tirith, or Mordor?   The fact that Minas Tirith feeds itself with Star Trek replicators instead of farms was a notable surprise. I remember being surprised by how green-glowy Minas Morgul is even though it's described like that in the book.  One cosmetic detail that was quite different from how I pictured the books, was how the elves all had curved swords. Also the abundance of plate armor."
tolkienfans,36cslc,sparklytomato,3,Mon May 18 20:39:24 2015 UTC,"I was influenced by a lot of the artwork by John Howe and Alan Lee, who also worked on the movie, so a lot of it matches up with my imagination. The Balrog, for instance, was exactly how I imagined him. One major difference to me was Lothlorien. In my mind it was truly the 'golden forest', with warm tones and a welcoming atmosphere. The cold blue palette used in the movie was totally different from what I expected. The whole art nouveau aesthetic for the elves was new to me too. I had imagined both Rivendell and Lothlorien to be more homely - like for Rivendell I imagined a big hall with a long wooden table and a crackling fire. I imagined The Shire to be more foresty, although that was clearly not what was described in the books. Gandalf was very much as I imagined him, but then he is basically John Howe's artwork come to life so that's hardly surprising."
tolkienfans,36cslc,Edledhron,8,Mon May 18 21:35:35 2015 UTC,"Most of the landscapes were way too brown.  Everything was too close together - you would not be able to see Mordor from deep within Rohan.  The balrog is a neat design, but it looks nothing like Tolkien's balrog.  Frodo should have looked a decade and a half older.  Aragorn was too small.  There was too much plate armor.  Galadriel did not becoming a SFX-witch when tempted by the Ring.  The Ringwraith's flying steeds weren't dragons.  Those are the big discrepancies for me in terms of visuals. There were things well done, particularly concerning the Shire, but Jackson didn't follow the descriptions in the book terribly well. His Middle-earth is very often beautiful, and has many interesting designs, but it isn't Tolkien's Middle-earth."

The great shadow descended like a falling cloud. And behold! it was a winged creature: if bird, then greater than all other birds, and it was naked, and neither quill nor feather did it bear, and its vast pinions were as webs of hide between horned fingers; and it stank.   ...   Suddenly the great beast beat its hideous wings, and the wind of them was foul. Again it leaped into the air, and then swiftly fell down upon Éowyn, shrieking, striking with beak and claw.   ...   And as they stood they saw all the Nazgûl gathered together, hovering above the Towers of the Teeth like vultures; and they knew that they were watched.   Letter 211:   Pterodactyl. Yes and no. I did not intend the steed of the Witch-King to be what is now called a 'pterodactyl', and often is drawn (with rather less shadowy evidence than lies behind many monsters of the new and fascinating semi-scientific mythology of the 'Prehistoric'). But obviously it is pterodactylic and owes much to the new mythology, and its description even provides a sort of way in which it could be a last survivor of older geological eras."

tolkienfans,36cslc,ScallopOolong,1 point,Mon May 18 22:36:00 2015 UTC,"Right. ""Fell beast"" has become a common way to refer to them. Similar to ""Durin's Bane"" for the Balrog of Moria, which isn't its name but more of a description."
tolkienfans,36cslc,Edledhron,3,Mon May 18 23:02:40 2015 UTC,"Though there's more basis in Tolkien for identifying the balrog of Moria as 'Durin's Bane' (certainly not to the point of it being its name, but something which clearly means that being) over using 'fell beasts' to refer exclusively to the flying steeds of the Ringwraiths."

The orcs I imagined looking more like orcs from Warcraft or war hammer. I imagined green skin, elf ears and pig noses. I imagined trolls more human like, with clothing and big noses. The hobbit movie got this better. I imagined elves less human like. More slender and shorter.  Rivendell was less fancy in my imagination, more like a Swiss mountain house.  The Uruk  hai looked more like big black ogres from war hammer in my mind. Let's see what else... Shelob should have been hairy, Saruoman's tower(name slips my mind) should have been more natural looking, like grey stone covered in moss and little bits of grass.  Frodo should have been older looking and Samwise should have been fatter. Strider/Aragon should have been beardless and skinny and more unattractive.

Where they went completely wrong though; Aragorn (and Arwen). He's supposed to be rugged, ugly, used, weathered. A person who immediately strikes you as ""not gold"". This comes from a Dane. Viggo did good, but it was the biggest step away from the books IMHO. We're talking Michael Wincott rugged, in a role he's never touched.  But the best was the pleasant surprises, things never sufficiently fleshed out in my imagination; Gollum, orcs, ents, Grima Wormtongue, Moria. All well done.  As for locations; the Shire was spot on, while Gondor was too Disney-like.  As for the overall feel; loved the first in extended edition, but ""Helm's Deep: The Movie"" didn't sit well with me."

If you watch all the documentaries and listen to the commentaries, most of the faults become forgivable because it becomes obvious how they arrived at the final script and how all the changes serve the needs of a 3-hour narrative arc (or simply the resources they were working with).

After that, I honestly tend to recommend Children of Hurin next, since it's the only other real ""narrative story"" (though there will be some unfamiliar names and context to get used to at first), often followed by Unfinished Tales (but skip the two First Age stories until after you've read The Silmarillion). Then read The Silmarillion. (Or if you want somewhat more personalized recommendations, try my customizable booklist, even though it needs some polish and updating.)  As for read counts, well. I lost count of my Hobbit/LotR rereads in early high school: my count was somewhere around 14 at the time. (I slowed down after college.) I figure I've read The Silmarillion and Unfinished Tales each maybe three or four times all the way through. I've read Children of Hurin once, but it overlaps almost entirely with the Narn in UT. I'm honestly not sure if I've read everything in HoMe twice at this point. I've read Letters at least twice. I'm spottier than I'd like on the more obscure stuff (things published in Vinyar Tengwar or Parma Eldalamberon, for instance), though I've read some of the good bits there.

On the night of my 21st birthday I wrote again to your mother – Jan. 3, 1913. On Jan. 8th I went back to her, and became engaged, and informed an astonished family.   Astonished indeed! But as he said:   My own history is so exceptional, so wrong and imprudent in nearly every point that it makes it difficult to counsel prudence.   Tolkien's attitudes to women seem to be full of contradictions that make it hard to pin him down. On the one hand he writes very, very few female characters, and most seem to be placed on a pedestal. On the other hand he writes Eowyn, who calls out those attitudes which consign women to be left behind. I was talking about this with a friend the other day (after a talk at Pembroke College actually), and she was arguing that Tolkien was fundamentally sexist. Not in a malicious way, but in that he didn't seem to understand women as people. This letter would seem to me to bear that out."
tolkienfans,369ejo,evrae,12,Mon May 18 02:18:03 2015 UTC,"Indeed; he was full of contradictions on women. Consider his comments about women as scholars — yet, many of his best and most famous students were women, and he took a keen interest in the education of women.  I think he had an internal conflict between the societally ingrained attitudes towards women that he had and his own feelings.   BTW, Eowyn is not his only female character who calls out men on their chauvinism; there's Erendis in ""Aldarion and Erendis"" in Unfinished Tales, for example."

But a young man does not really (as a rule) want 'friendship', even if he says he does. There are plenty of young men (as a rule). He wants love: innocent, and yet irresponsible perhaps.

tolkienfans,368ui5,SmokiePots,54,Sun May 17 08:02:27 2015 UTC,"Firstly, I would like to say that Bilbo is a storyteller, but that doesn’t mean he is “completely full of shit” as you suggest.  “The Hobbit” was written as a children’s story, and has the episodic nature that suits bedtime stories, as well as a lighter tone. It is a Bildungsroman, and we can clearly see Bilbo develop from naivety and ignorance through experience into a wise, brave hobbit. “The Hobbit” is written in the third person, through Bilbo’s perspective, and we see the events through his eyes. The tone of “The Lord of the Rings” is much darker, which makes sense since it is written for a different audience.  The atmosphere of the novel changes from the light hearted “A Long Expected Party” which is similar to “The Hobbit”, and develops and grows to become the novel that opens up Tolkien’s entire mythology and makes it accessible. This might explain the playful tone of the earlier novel, and why you might be so dismissive of Bilbo.  However, despite any “embellishments” by Bilbo, it is a mistake to dismiss him. Let’s see how other characters in “The Lord of the Rings” view Bilbo.  Elrond reflects on Frodo’s journey to Rivendell and says “I have known few hobbits, save Bilbo here; and it seems to me that he is perhaps not alone and singular as I had thought him” (The Fellowship of the Ring, The Council of Elrond). Elrond himself admired Bilbo, and viewed him as an incredible person. Here he is considering the fact that Bilbo is not the only amazing hobbit, demonstrating how often the hobbits are so overlooked. One message I always take away from “The Hobbit” and “The Lord of the Rings” is how the hobbits are these incredible people, despite how they are viewed by so many people. It is the hobbits that make all the difference to the fight against Sauron.  Next, consider the response to Bilbo’s bravery in offering to take the ring to Mount Doom.  “Boromir looked in surprise at Bilbo, but the laughter died on his lips when he saw that all the others regarded the old hobbit with grave respect. Only Glóin smiled, but his smile came from old memories” (The Fellowship of the Ring, The Council of Elrond). Boromir responds with laughter, underestimating Bilbo just as you are doing. All the other people look at Bilbo with “grave respect”. Glóin’s smile comes from old memories because he knows full well how invaluable Bilbo was in ensuring the defeat of Smaug and helping the dwarves regain their home.  Also, consider the fact the Bilbo and Aragorn are good friends, and that Bilbo writes the famous lines All that is gold does not glitter, not all those who wander are lost that go along with Aragorn: “But I am Aragorn, and those verses go with that name” (The Fellowship of the Ring, Strider). We learn at the council that Bilbo wrote those lines for Aragorn.   ‘I made that up myself,’ he whispered to Frodo, ‘for the Dúnadan, a long time ago when he first told me about himself. I almost wish that my adventures were not over, and that I could go with him when his day comes.’ Aragorn smiled at him; then he turned to Boromir again. (The Fellowship of the Ring, The Council of Elrond).  Gandalf chose Bilbo because he considers Bilbo a strong character. He needed somebody who could be stealthy and quiet, and he chose Bilbo deliberately because of Bilbo’s qualities, of which his hobbit-like quietness was only one small factor.  So Bilbo is deliberately chosen by Gandalf, a dear friend of Aragorn, Elrond considers him an incredible person, and Gloin (and all the dwarves of Erebor) honour Bilbo for his crucial aid in helping them get their home back.  I could go on and on, but this is probably more than enough to read through."

tolkienfans,368ui5,EricKei,4,Sun May 17 16:26:02 2015 UTC,"Off the top of my head -- probably most of it. IIRC, Gandalf was very aware of this, and I think he had serious doubts about Bilbo's riddle-game tale (how he got the ring in the first place), in particular...It's been too long since I re-read that thing x.x   Put simply, between the Ring's influence on Bilbo and the natural desire of any storyteller to embellish their own role in a story, I'm fairly certain that he was shoveling quite a load of shit for much of that time.  Consider, also, the established notion that hobbits just don't like to leave their home turf for any reason. He wanted to be thought of as this great adventurer, yanked away from hearth and home (Oh! The indignity!) but quickly rising to the occasion --- thus making him some noble, put-upon hero who (if anything) was more of a hero than the dwarves and that odd human wizard who kept popping up...What was his name? Randolph or something? ;)   To be fair, the elves did see fit to honor him in LotR simply by letting him hang out with them, and, later, letting him go with them when they left. On the other hand, it could simply have been an issue of Gandalf telling them to keep an eye on his favorite little troublemaker, whether they really wanted to or not, just to keep him from doing something stupid.   As for Tom Bombadil, I suspect that our dear boy found himself some really interesting plant life and decided to toss it into a stew on that one.

Basically, Bilbo started writing down Frodo's story too after their arrival in Rivendell and then Frodo picked up where he left off. Sam finished it up at the end when Frodo left, but there are significant other portions of it that were ""supplemented"" by accounts of what happened to the rest of the fellowship when Frodo and Sam were not present (books III and V for example)."

tolkienfans,3643ia,weeniehut,4,Fri May 15 23:16:11 2015 UTC,"I think that there are several options.  One is that the Valar and all others in Valinor had remained aloof.  If so, Morgoth might have turned his full might upon Doriath, and then the Girdle of Melian would probably not have sufficed.  It would have been to Beleriand as Sauron's victory would have been to the Westlands of Middle-earth three Ages later.  But in the event Morgoth focussed on his war in Beleriand in part because that's where his mightiest enemies were, since the Noldor did come.  If they had not, then Morgoth might have spread his attention all over Middle-earth, with Doriath and the wider Beleriand being only part of his quarry.  The Men approaching from the east, who were known to him, might have attracted relatively more of his attention, and earlier.  If so, Doriath might have survived long, in part by lying low in the terrain, attracting as little attention as possible.  Perhaps (nudged by Eru) something heroic might have arisen in Beleriand or elsewhere to resist Morgoth, with some success.  In the event the Noldor were certainly not the only source of heroic resistance.  Another possibility is that the Noldor having turned back, they and the rest of the folk of Valinor might have reconciled and then presented a unified front against Morgoth.  The War of Wrath might have happened much as it did in the event, with a pardoned Fëanor commanding the Noldorin part of the expeditionary force, regaining his Silmarils as but part of the spoils of victory.  Perhaps after the rape of Doriath, with Melian herself escaping to become the emissary to Valinor that Eärendil was in the event?"
tolkienfans,3643ia,harabanaz,3,Sat May 16 08:52:47 2015 UTC,"The Valar might have convened and decided to strike against Morgoth, I'm sure the Valar realised some definitive battle needed to be fought, but it is by no means certain. After all, no rescue parties were sent to the aid of the Avari Elves. Why should one have been sent for the Sindar?"
tolkienfans,3643ia,PrivateChicken,2,Fri May 15 23:53:09 2015 UTC,"I agree, but the Sindar are Eldar, and the Avari are not, and I think thats why the Valar would be invested"
tolkienfans,3643ia,AmbiguousAnonymous,-2,Sat May 16 00:29:02 2015 UTC,"Eldar refers specifically to Elves that have seen the Trees of Light, or more generally those who have made it to Aman. They were called the light elves for this reason. The Sindar are the grey elves because they started the journey but stopped after the diversion of Elwë."
tolkienfans,3643ia,asmohov,12,Sat May 16 01:17:04 2015 UTC,"No, Eldar just means they started the westward journey. According to the Silmarillion:   In after days he became a king renowned, and his people were all the Eldar of Beleriand; the Sindar they were named, the Grey-elves, the Elves of the Twilight and King Greymantle was he, Elu Thingol in the tongue of that land.   ""Calaquendi"" is the word for light elves, and does refer specifically to those that made it to Aman."
tolkienfans,3643ia,PersonUsingAComputer,1 point,Sat May 16 02:36:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks for answering! To go further with your idea, why didn't the Valar attack Morgoth immediately after he stole the Silmarils? I haven't read the Silmarillion in a while, so I don't remember if they gave a specific reason. The Valar had fought and beat Morgoth during the shaping of Arda and when the Elves first awoke at Cuvienen.  They would do so again at the end of the First age. Was it because the Valar had decided not to interfere in any parts of the world outside of Valinor (and Earendil's plea made them make an exception)? Or because the Valar did not feel justified in helping the Noldor since they turned their back on them just as the Sindar, Nandor, and the Avari had done by never going to Valinor in the first place?"
tolkienfans,3643ia,Cavelcade,2,Sat May 16 01:15:43 2015 UTC,"They tried to chase him down, but the darkness of Ungoliant made it so that not even Oromë or Tulkas could catch them. Then he went back to his own fortress, and while the Valar were debating what to do Fëanor made the decision for them.  Had he turned back, they would probably have gone to capture him again."
tolkienfans,3643ia,acetylinsomnia,1 point,Tue May 19 12:56:14 2015 UTC,"The Valar have to make careful consideration whenever they intervene outside of Aman because it ends in cataclysm, both after the War for the Sake of the Elves and the War of Wrath.

tolkienfans,3626t8,ToffeeKing,64,Fri May 15 13:54:23 2015 UTC,It has always been my understanding that this was essentially a case of suicide-by-Morgoth.  He was prompted to challenge Morgoth because he felt there was no chance for an elven victory anymore.
tolkienfans,3626t8,jmw6572,20,Fri May 15 14:05:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks for replying. Fingolfin is frequently praised on this sub as one of the most ""badass"" Tolkien characters mainly because of this scene. I agree it takes some serious guts (or hopelessness) to taunt Morgoth, but if he almost knew for certain it was going to kill him I think he could've done something a bit more productive than giving Morgoth a limp. If he had retreated, he could've helped defend Gondolin and maybe rid the world of another balrog or dragon."
tolkienfans,3626t8,PrivateChicken,37,Fri May 15 15:35:47 2015 UTC,"On the whole, the Noldor do a really poor job of accomplishing anything. Many of the mightiest among them still end up ineffective."

I wouldn't call them ineffective - they end up as enemies of the mightiest being in Arda and all that he could muster. Balrogs and dragons are generally tougher than orcs."
tolkienfans,3626t8,eternalaeon,20,Fri May 15 17:10:36 2015 UTC,"Also, to be fair, everyone and everything was the enemy of Morgoth.

tolkienfans,3626t8,nycnewsjunkie,7,Fri May 15 18:39:46 2015 UTC,"Cheers, didn't expect that analogy. But I was trying to say that the feat was not to make an enemy out of Morgoth but to stand up to him. It's unfair to call the Noldor ineffective when they often have to measure up to greater evils than were at work in the Third Age. Is it ineffective to die in combat? If it's a one-on-one against a stunted goblin, maybe. If it's one of the seven balrogs, no. That makes an impact."
tolkienfans,3626t8,Soarel2,4,Fri May 15 19:16:42 2015 UTC,"Is it ineffective to die in combat? If it's a one-on-one against a stunted goblin, maybe. If it's one of the seven balrogs, no.   Both are equally as ineffective. Praiseworthy and reasonable outcome are two entirely different concepts from effective. You lose the war no matter who you die to. It is completely fair to say the Noldor are ineffective if they don't accomplish their goal, it doesn't matter that others have it easier when you are just arguing whether something was effective. Only effect matters.  Edit: The argument I think you want to make is that the fact that they are ineffective is not as important as dealing more difficult challenges. Nevertheless, the fact remains that one can be ineffective even when they are being more glorious."
tolkienfans,3626t8,star_boy2005,0,Fri May 15 23:45:37 2015 UTC,"No, that's not the argument I'm making. You don't lose a war no matter who you die to. Someone in this thread said a Noldo may have had a 1/10 chance of defeating a Balrog in single combat. If you succeed, Morgoth's loss of a Balrog most likely makes a greater strategic impact than the Noldor's loss of a single warrior regardless of skill. The Balrogs are capable of mass destruction on a different scale. Ecthelion and Glorfindel improved their people's chance of winning in the long run by defeating one each."
tolkienfans,3626t8,Soarel2,3,Sat May 16 07:08:22 2015 UTC,In truth the Noldor ultimately partially succeed. Their resistance to Morgoth leads to Beren recovering a Simeral and eventually convince the Valar to intervene freeing middle earth of Morgtoth.

People act purely out of passion all the time in real life and I can't imagine anyone calling Fingolfin ""unproductive"" by doing an extremely brave thing which is challenging a Demi-God to battle and actually hurting him in a way no one knew was possible for a child of Illuvatar."
tolkienfans,3626t8,AmbiguousAnonymous,13,Fri May 15 17:06:04 2015 UTC,I like this answer a lot. How boring would the hobbit have been of Bilbo didn't need a huge amount of nudging in the beginning. His initial stubbornness and simpleness made the character arc so wonderful.   Passionate decisions are kind of what make characters unique in stories.
tolkienfans,3626t8,cacafogo,7,Fri May 15 18:06:22 2015 UTC,"It is also very retrospective and easy to say he made a bad decision  It is similar to the idea (and I can't remember if it is identical to the books) when Frodo says about Gollum in the film:  Frodo: It is a pity Bilbo didn't kill him  Gandalf: Pity? It was pity that stayed Bilbo's hand. Many that live deserve death. Some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them, Frodo? Do not be too eager to deal out death in judgment. Even the very wise cannot see all ends...  Frodo see's Bilbo's decision not to kill him as poor, in the end, Gollum accidentally rectifies Frodo's failures. Fingolfin doesn't succeed but who's to say he couldn't have."
tolkienfans,3626t8,Kiltmanenator,3,Fri May 15 19:18:53 2015 UTC,"I don't remember Tolkien touching on this specifically, but wounding Melkor surely didn't help his follower's confidence. If you were a maiar or dragon or other fell beast following Morgoth and you witnessed the pitched battle at the gates. Imagine what goes through your mind when Fingolfin, an enemy whom Morgoth should have been more than capable of obliterating, deals a wounding blow to your God. From then on you're just supposed to . . . what? Ignore your master's obvious limp? Awkwardly cough when His Principle Evilness struggles to mount his throne? Surely some of his followers were shaken and considered their position in Morgoth's thralldom more tentatively. Hell, I imagine Morgoth's own confidence was notched. So maybe it was a stupid decision. Like you said, however, it was a decision of passion and one that was not light in its implications."

Also, remember when the Noldorin War against Morgoth is doomed to failure. They cannot succeed. Re-read Feanor's death scene. He knows with the knowledge of death that Elven attempts to defeat Morgoth are hopeless. It's one of the reasons why his insistence that his sons double-down is so despicable.

tolkienfans,3626t8,AmbiguousAnonymous,5,Fri May 15 16:04:22 2015 UTC,"I sort of understand this line of reasoning. Wanting to kindle the hope and courage of his people makes sense; I'm just taken aback by his decision when he could've regrouped and made a greater impact on the outcome of the war, even if it meant defeat eventually. Rather than remaining in Middle-Earth to fight, he seems to decide to go out with a bang and leave the final battle to his sons and others."

Thousands die and suffer in the War of the Ring, but we don't see Elrond and Glorfindel riding to knock on the Black Gate for three millennia after the Last Alliance. Keyword is ""Last"" - the Noldor fought Morgoth for centuries but keep leaving ME even though Sauron is rising anew. To me that's a stark contrast."
tolkienfans,3626t8,xxmindtrickxx,4,Fri May 15 17:55:06 2015 UTC,"Thousand's of elves die and suffer in the War of the Ring?  I don't think so, they were mostly reserved at that time in Imladris and Lorien.  And the Noldor originally left Valinor in the first place over Feanor's oath regarding Melkor and the silmarils.  IMO With the silmaril's gone, the Noldor become a different people in the second and third age.  The aren't pissed of for many reasons, mainly that its generally better than when Melkor was around."
tolkienfans,3626t8,xxmindtrickxx,1 point,Fri May 15 19:11:44 2015 UTC,"Didn't say elves, referred mostly to Men. It's stressed at the Council of Elrond that the free peoples need to stand together, yet the elves consider their age in ME gone and sail west rather than stay and fight - even though they would most likely be reincarnated in Aman if they fell in battle. Morgoth is worth fighting, but let's leave Sauron alone ever since he defeated our high king? That happened several times over in the Silmarillion. I'm trying to reconcile the elves' mentality in the two works. I realise the silmarils were the motivation for Fëanor and his sons."
tolkienfans,3626t8,Ya_like_dags,3,Fri May 15 19:24:31 2015 UTC,"They had far more choice once the ban on their return had been lifted. Also, the Elves saw some kinship with the three great houses of Men, and plenty of what they did was out of loyalty to Hurin and Huor and Tuor and Beren. The elves of ME still sing songs of the Men of that era, but feel little or no kinship with the men who remain in ME, especially not after the fall of Numenor and the Numenoreans dwindling in Arnor and Gondor."
tolkienfans,3626t8,xxmindtrickxx,2,Fri May 15 20:22:58 2015 UTC,"The elves mentality is to endure.  Men were much more invested because their lives were so short.  I think even Hurin makes mention of this.  Also, I'm still confused by your ""thousands die in the WOTR""  The War of the ring was pretty quick, and only happened at the end of the Third Age.  Also, elves did fight in the battles, but they knew ultimately that it was up to man because their time was failing.  In many ways it simply wasn't their problem.  Man failed to finish the deed at the last alliance, why risk war when you can just sail to Aman?  Also, Morgoth took nearly everything from the elves.  The elves of the first age are much more powerful than the elves of the second and third age."
tolkienfans,3626t8,AmbiguousAnonymous,1 point,Fri May 15 21:38:52 2015 UTC,"The War of the Ring was short, but included capital battles. The count is an estimation on my part, taking the fighting at Westfold and Helm's Deep, Minas Tirith, Osgiliath, Lothlorien, Mirkwood, Erebor and other places into account. I take issue with the elves not considering it ""their problem"", if only because it's such a change in mentality compared to the Sil. The elves in the First Age were mightier, but Morgoth was also more powerful than Sauron. The idea that Isildur was responsible for Sauron's survival is played up in the films - in the book, it seems reasonable of him to claim weregild. I'd say it was a mutual failure."
tolkienfans,3626t8,xxmindtrickxx,2,Fri May 15 21:45:16 2015 UTC,"ME had lost a lot of its vitality for the the elves in LotR.  Don't forget that Morgoth had put his very essence into the soil and air.  This affected the elves greatly because of their fundamental connection to the land.  Nenya and Vilya cleansed Rivendell and Lothlorien of Morgoth's taint, but everywhere else Arda had faded.    The only reason that elves were still around is because their Rings could cleanse Arda of Morgoth's taint to a limited extent.  But the Wise among them suspected that their Rings would fail once the One was destroyed.    Tolkien says over and over that was no happy ending for the elves in LotR.  If they didn't fight, they would lose to Sauron.  If they fought and won, their Rings would fail and the elves would lose to Morgoth's taint.    That's why the fire in their belly to destroy Evil died out, and why the LotR elves act so differently from the Sim elves.  Sauron's One Ring was a brilliant, masterful stroke which forced the retirement of his most powerful opponents from the field.  When it reappeared, they knew that their doom was finally upon them, and that they would have to leave ME soon, one way or another."
tolkienfans,3626t8,AmbiguousAnonymous,4,Sat May 16 14:33:16 2015 UTC,"See, I think Fingolfin took Arnold's words from Predator to heart. ""If it bleeds, we can kill it.""

tolkienfans,3626t8,newtonpage,14,Fri May 15 20:33:15 2015 UTC,"I put the passage below for others.  I personally think he did believe he could kill him and end the war once-and-for-all kind of thing. But more than that I think he felt filled with the faith of Eru that he could defeat Morgoth, which is why I think Tolkien describes him as ""gleaming beneath him like a star"".   But the passage doesn't say if he believed he could kill him. Just that he was filled with ""anger and despair"" and that he appeared with such speed and fury that people fled because they believed him to be the Vala Orome.  I don't think he threw his life away at all or that there would ever be an opportunity for the greatest elves to gather and challenge Morgoth and his captains for Arda. With the exception of Glorfindel I think most of the great battles such as Ecthelion is an example of winning a fight that he had a 1/10 chance to win and happened to pull off the 1 event.  Edit: A lot of battles are David and Goliath like in LotR, the great people are only great because they did what people thought couldn't be done.   A lot of these LotR heroes were not held in the highest regard prior to their battles. The perfect example is Ecthelion's fight. Little is known about his battle prowess before he fought Gothmog, other than that he's a high born elf and by reputation would be considered to be better than average. He engages Gothmog mid-battle to protect his kingdom and the fallen body of Feanor. Feanor by the way is stated to be the most gifted/powerful elf in LotR, but he lost where Ecthelion succeeded.  This is also how I view Fingolfin's fight.   Now news came to Hithlum that Dorthonion was lost and the sons of Finarfin overthrown, and that the sons of Fëanor were driven from their lands. Then Fingolfin beheld (as it seemed to him) the utter ruin of the Noldor, and the defeat beyond redress of all their houses; and filled with wrath and despair he mounted upon Rochallor his great horse and rode forth alone, and none might restrain him. He passed over Dor-nu-Fauglith like a wind amid the dust, and all that beheld his onset fled in amaze, thinking that Oromë himself was come: for a great madness of rage was upon him, so that his eyes shone like the eyes of the Valar. Thus he came alone to Angband's gates, and he sounded his horn, and smote once more upon the brazen doors, and challenged Morgoth to come forth to single combat. And Morgoth came.  That was the last time in those wars that he passed the doors of his stronghold, and it is said that he took not the challenge willingly; for though his might was greatest of all things in this world, alone of the Valar he knew fear. But he could not now deny the challenge before the face of his captains; for the rocks rang with the shrill music of Fingolfin's horn, and his voice came keen and clear down into the depths of Angband; and Fingolfin named Morgoth craven, and lord of slaves. Therefore Morgoth came, climbing slowly from his subterranean throne, and the rumour of his feet was like thunder underground. And he issued forth clad in black armour; and he stood before the King like a tower, iron-crowned, and his vast shield, sable on-blazoned, cast a shadow over him like a stormcloud. But Fingolfin gleamed beneath it as a star; for his mail was overlaid with silver, and his blue shield was set with crystals; and he drew his sword Ringil, that glittered like ice.  Then Morgoth hurled aloft Grond, the Hammer of the Underworld, and swung it down like a bolt of thunder. But Fingolfin sprang aside, and Grond rent a mighty pit in the earth, whence smoke and fire darted. Many times Morgoth essayed to smite him, and each time Fingolfin leaped away, as a 'lightning shoots from under a dark cloud; and he wounded Morgoth with seven wounds, and seven times Morgoth gave a cry of anguish, whereat the hosts of Angband fell upon their faces in dismay, and the cries echoed in the Northlands.  But at the last the King grew weary, and Morgoth bore down his shield upon him. Thrice he was crushed to his knees, and thrice arose again and bore up his broken shield and stricken helm. But the earth was all rent and pitted about him, and he stumbled and fell backward before the feet of Morgoth; and Morgoth set his left foot upon his neck, and the weight of it was like a fallen hill. Yet with his last and desperate stroke Fingolfin hewed the foot with Ringil, and the blood gashed forth black and smoking and filled the pits of Grond.  Thus died Fingolfin, High King of the Noldor, most proud and valiant of the Elven-kings of old. The Orcs made no boast of that duel at the gate; neither do the Elves sing of it, for their sorrow is too deep. Yet the tale of it is remembered still, for Thorondor King of Eagles brought the tidings to Gondolin, and to Hithlum afar off. And Morgoth took the body of the Elven-king and broke it, and would cast it to his wolves; but Thorondor came hasting from his eyrie among the peaks of the Crissaegrim, and he stooped upon Morgoth and marred his face. The rushing of the wings of Thorondor was like the noise of the winds of Manwë, and he seized the body in his mighty talons, and soaring suddenly above the darts of the Orcs he bore the King away. And he laid him upon a mountain-top that looked from the north upon the hidden valley of Gondolin; and Turgon coming built a high cairn over his father. No Orc dared ever after to pass over the mount of Fingolfin or draw nigh his tomb, until the doom of Gondolin was come and treachery was born among his kin. Morgoth went ever halt of one foot after that day, and the pain of his wounds could not be healed; and in his face was the scar that Thorondor made."

But he is later described as dying of his 'many' wounds, inflicted during the extended combat with the Balrogs.

So in anger, despair he was basically like, 'If this is the end, it'll be the way I want it to be.' so he grabbed his horse, filled with anger and rage, made way to Angband and challenged Morgoth. Keep in mind, Fingolfin has just witnessed the UTTER RUIN of everything he loves and holds dear. So whether or not he 'thought' he could win was not important to the situation. He wanted Morgoth to pay whether or not it was beyond him had not occurred to him.

tolkienfans,3610nj,Uluithiad,7,Fri May 15 05:16:46 2015 UTC,"Tolkien analyzed the Ring-verse in two contradictory entries (PE17:11-12). In one, burzum ""darkness"" contains búrz ""dark"" and -um apparently corresponds to ""-ness"". In the other entry, um is said to be ""a particularizing suffix or 'article'"", though David Salo notes that those ""([...] are not exactly the same thing), and the scare quotes around ‘article’ don’t inspire confidence! Moreover, the “debased” version of Black Speech used by the Mordor-orc in his curse has no -ums, despite (in some of its translations) having one or more articles.""  Therefore, while some might suggest *ashum for ""the one"", that may be more like ""oneness"" or ""unity"" after all, which is what the prevailing opinion was pre-PE17 anyway. Failing um, we have no articles attested."

""them"" object suffix, and the two meager sources mentioning grammar disagree on whether subject pronouns are prefixed or suffixed.  The only numeral we know is ""one"". ""He"", ""I', ""they"" and all the other pronouns besides ul are unknown. ""Wraith"" is similar to the meaning of gûl in Nazgûl, but ""man flesh"" is also unattested.   We know nothing about verb conjugation except the verb ending  at (""like a participle"") found in durbat, gimbat, thrakat, krimpat (verbs durb- ""constrain, force, dominate"", gimb- ""seek out, discover"", thrak- ""bring by force, hale, drag"", krimp- ""tie, bind""). Though Tolkien translates those as ""to rule, to find, to bring, to bind"" in English, he notes that durbat means ""constraining, of a sort to constrain"".

tolkienfans,3610nj,magradhaid,2,Fri May 15 18:56:34 2015 UTC,"Like someone else suggested, you could leave out the word 'ring'. So that would mean using the first part of the inscription (Ash nazg durbatuluk) without the part that means 'nazg'. The problem is that you'd have to figure out what characters of the actual inscription written in Tengwar you're supposed to leave out. You can tell which characters mean 'ash nazg', because the first three parts obviously have those in common. But I can't tell for sure where to separate 'ash' from 'nazg'.  I found this website. If you go to the part of the ring inscription and click 'select', it leads you to the Tengwar inscription. You could edit the English text, like putting a space before and after 'nazg' to see exactly which characters mean 'nazg', but I don't know how reliable this source is really.  I must say I don't know if just one part of the text will be long enough to make it go in a circle and still look good, especially after leaving out the 'nazg' part. Don't think those characters would look right in a circle that small. If you're concerned with getting it right and authentic, you should just go for the full, complete inscription.  Hope that helps you somehow."

Gandalf's knew Frodo could never actually destroy the ring. His plan was to get the ring to the Crack of Doom and basically hope for the best. He trusted that Eru, or fate, would take care of things if he just pushed events in the proper direction. Hence his prophecy about Gollum having a part to play in the story."
tolkienfans,35qj5i,brianalmon,48,Tue May 12 18:56:54 2015 UTC,"Indeed, and to add to that, he briefed Frodo with the one thing which would save him: the importance of pity. Frodo and Sam's pity of Gollum is the thing that allows the quest to succeed."

Sam's disdain for Gollum is what drove him over the edge at the crucial moment when Smeagol might have won out. Tolkien even explores the hypothetical situation in which Smeagol won, suggesting in the end he might have voluntarily taken the Ring into the fire to his own end as a final act of friendship and service for Frodo."
tolkienfans,35qj5i,EyeceEyeceBaby,36,Tue May 12 20:12:26 2015 UTC,"Right, but on the slopes of Mt. Doom, Sam has a moment of pity for Gollum and he does spare his life, arguably saving the quest:   ""‘Now!’ said Sam. ‘At last I can deal with you!’ He leaped forward with drawn blade ready for battle. But Gollum did not spring. He fell flat upon the ground and whimpered.  ‘Don’t kill us,’ he wept. ‘Don’t hurt us with nassty cruel steel! Let us live, yes, live just a little longer. Lost lost! We’re lost. And when Precious goes we’ll die, yes, die into the dust.’ He clawed up the ashes of the path with his long fleshless fingers. ‘Dusst!’ he hissed.  Sam’s hand wavered. His mind was hot with wrath and the memory of evil. It would be just to slay this treacherous, murderous creature, just and many times deserved; and also it seemed the only safe thing to do. But deep in his heart there was something that restrained him: he could not strike this thing lying in the dust, forlorn, ruinous, utterly wretched. He himself, though only for a little while, had borne the Ring, and now dimly he guessed the agony of Gollum’s shrivelled mind and body, enslaved to that Ring, unable to find peace or relief ever in life again. But Sam had no words to express what he felt. ‘Oh, curse you, you stinking thing!’ he said. ‘Go away! Be off! I don’t trust you, not as far as I could kick you; but be off. Or I shall hurt you, yes, with nasty cruel steel.’   That is my favorite part of the entire book, because Sam of all people who had opposed Gollum's help in the entire adventure actually feels a moment of pity for Gollum."
tolkienfans,35qj5i,tobymoby616,10,Tue May 12 20:37:47 2015 UTC,"True! I just remembered this when looking up the quoted text in this reply. As Tolkien says, ""He did reach the point of pity at last but for the good of Gollum too late,"" but for the good of Frodo, it seems, just in time. If not for Gollum, Frodo would have needed to voluntarily cast himself into the fire. It took Sam bearing the Ring, even if just for a short while, to begin to understand Gollum and feel a bit of genuine pity for him."
tolkienfans,35qj5i,EyeceEyeceBaby,21,Tue May 12 20:43:36 2015 UTC,"I know the moment you're referring to: it's the bit when he calls him a ""sneak"". It's true that that moment does cause Gollum to change his mind about atoning and admitting his treachery (which he is about to before Sam startles him), but it doesn't change the fact that Sam's pity nonetheless saved the day. There were other moments where Sam could have killed Gollum, and didn't."
tolkienfans,35qj5i,FaerieStories,22,Tue May 12 20:19:16 2015 UTC,"True, but why didn't he? Did he spare Gollum of his own accord? Or was it perhaps out of loyalty to his master? He might have pitied Gollum in his own way, but it always seemed to me to be more out of loyalty and love for Frodo than of his own kindness and understanding of Gollum's wretchedness. If that's the case then I would still argue it was Frodo's pity, rather than Sam's that saved Gollum and the quest."
tolkienfans,35qj5i,EyeceEyeceBaby,12,Tue May 12 20:31:29 2015 UTC,That's a good point. It's hard to say whether Sam genuinely pitied Gollum. Frodo certainly did - largely because his time with the ring meant he knew what Gollum was going through and so had that empathetic connection. Not sure about Sam. It's been so long since I've read it: I'm not sure if there is any indication that Sam had any pity for Gollum.
tolkienfans,35qj5i,FaerieStories,12,Tue May 12 20:35:32 2015 UTC,"Actually he did. It was just much too late to save Gollum. /u/tobymoby616 pointed out the passage I had forgotten. I think I would still say it was Frodo's pity that was ultimately the most crucial. But for his compassion, they might not have even made it into Mordor. Sam does come to the point of pity, after he has borne the Ring. (Here's tobymoby616's comment)"
tolkienfans,35qj5i,EyeceEyeceBaby,4,Tue May 12 20:52:00 2015 UTC,"If we are comparing various pities, I think the most ""crucial"" pity of all was Bilbo's.  Bilbo at the time was not a fully comprehensive ringbearer and didn't really know what Gollum must have been going through.  He had only just found the Ring and had no idea of its importance.  It was pure mercy that kept Bilbo from killing Gollum in the goblin tunnels.  The greatest act of mercy, made even greater because it was not asked for, nor would it ever conceivably be noticed."

tolkienfans,35qj5i,ANewMachine615,15,Tue May 12 20:28:25 2015 UTC,"Tolkien actually imagines this exact scenario. Here's the quote from Letter 246:   For me perhaps the most tragic moment in the Tale comes in II 323 ff. when Sam fails to note the complete change in Gollum’s tone and aspect. ‘Nothing, nothing,’ said Gollum softly. 'Nice master!’ His repentance is blighted and all Frodo’s pity is (in a sense) wasted. Shelob’s lair becomes inevitable.   This is due of course to the 'logic of the story’. Sam could hardly have acted differently. (He did reach the point of pity at last but for the good of Gollum too late.) If he had, what could then have happened? The course of the entry into Mordor and the struggle to reach Mount Doom would have been different, and so would the ending. The interest would have shifted to Gollum, I think, and the battle that would have gone on between his repentance and his new love on one side and the Ring. Though the love would have been strengthened daily it could not have wrested the mastery from the Ring. I think that in some queer twisted and pitiable way Gollum would have tried (not maybe with conscious design) to satisfy both. Certainly at some point not long before the end he would have stolen the Ring or taken it by violence (as he does in the actual Tale). But 'possession’ satisfied, I think he would then have sacrificed himself for Frodo’s sake and have voluntarily cast himself into the fiery abyss.   I think that an effect of his partial regeneration by love would have been a clearer vision when he claimed the Ring. He would have perceived the evil of Sauron, and suddenly realised that he could not use the Ring and had not the strength or stature to keep it in Sauron’s despite: the only way to  keep it and hurt Sauron was to destroy it and himself together–and in a flash he may have seen that this would also be the greatest service to Frodo. Frodo in the tale actually takes the Ring and claims it, and certainly he too would have had a clear vision–but he was not given any time: he was immediately attacked by Gollum. When Sauron was aware of the seizure of the Ring his one hope was in its power: that the claimant would be unable to relinquish it until Sauron had time to deal with him. Frodo too would then probably, if not attacked, have had to take the same way: cast himself with the Ring into the abyss. If not he would of course have completely failed."
tolkienfans,35qj5i,EyeceEyeceBaby,7,Tue May 12 20:38:23 2015 UTC,"That's interesting. Given the recent thread about suicide, now I'm curious how these hypotheticals would affect the discussion.  It's very interesting that Tolkien supposes that not only Gollum, but Frodo as well might have cast themselves into the fire. Frodo, in many ways, is the moral center of the novel, so it's pretty significant that under certain circumstances Tolkien supposes he would commit suicide as well.  Of course one could argue that really we're talking about martyrdom and not suicide here, but at the very least the line between the two is a blurry one."
tolkienfans,35qj5i,PrivateChicken,6,Tue May 12 23:17:41 2015 UTC,"Tolkien does say that Frodo's failure to throw away the Ring was clear from the outset, but he never specifically says that Gandalf knew that for a fact."

I can't see Gandalf subjecting Frodo to what he did if he knew right then and there that he wouldn't be able to do it. That's one heck of a gamble.   Even if Gandalf was sure Frodo could throw it in (and I would strongly argue he knew full well that he couldn't) it would still be a heck of a gamble. One Hobbit to trot all the way to Mordor? Even trotting to Rivendell would be dangerous.   This is hardly unusual for Gandalf. He's a little more mature in The Lord of the Rings, it's true, but in The Hobbit he was more than willing to risk the life of Bilbo purely for his own amusement at seeing this tubby fellow bouncing from danger to danger."

Doom, but even if he somehow got there, impossible to voluntarily toss the Ring into the volcano.  It's just impossible.    So how can Tolkien make it plausible?  That's the suspense in the story of the Ring, the tension that keeps us on edge.  It's a tightwire act on the part of Tolkien, how can he possibly pull it off?  Of course, Tolkien also throws in multiple surprises after the Ring is unmade, including a surprisingly-melancholy ending.  So it turns out that the ending is not predicable at all."

tolkienfans,35mfuy,TheBeardedGM,104,Mon May 11 18:31:22 2015 UTC,"The following passage in Durin's Folk, Appendix A is the only mention regarding the nature of dwarf women:   Dís was the daughter of Thráin II. She is the only dwarf-woman named in these histories. It was said by Gimli that there are few dwarf-women, probably no more than a third of the whole people. They seldom walk abroad except at great need, They are in voice and appearance, and in garb if they must go on a journey, so like to the dwarf-men that the eyes and ears of other peoples cannot tell them apart. This has given rise to the foolish opinion among Men that there are no dwarf-women, and that the Dwarves 'grow out of stone'.    It is because of the fewness of women among them that the kind of the Dwarves increases slowly, and is in peril when they have no secure dwellings. For Dwarves take only one wife or husband each in their lives, and are jealous, as in all matters of their rights. The number of dwarf-men that marry is actually less than one-third. For not all the women take husbands: some desire none; some desire one that they cannot get, and so will have no other. As for the men, very many also do not desire marriage, being engrossed in their crafts."

tolkienfans,35mfuy,mrdaneeyul,6,Tue May 12 13:54:44 2015 UTC,"His choice is based the pluralization on some of the earliest variants of the word in Anglo-Saxon. From Appendix F of LOTR:    It may be observed that in this book as in The Hobbit the form dwarves is used, although the dictionaries tell us that the plural of dwarf is dwarfs. It should be dwarrows (or dwerrows), if singular and plural had each gone its own way down the years, as have man and men, or goose and geese. But we no longer speak of a dwarf as often as we do of a man, or even of a goose, and memories have not been fresh enough among Men to keep hold of a special plural for a race now abandoned to folk-tales, where at least a shadow of truth is preserved, or at last to nonsense-stories in which they have become mere figures of fun. But in the Third Age something of their old character and power is still glimpsed, if already a little dimmed: these are the descendants of the Naugrim of the Elder Days, in whose hearts still burns the ancient fire of Aule the Smith, and the embers smoulder of their long grudge against the Elves; in in whose hands still lives the skill in works of stone that none have surpassed.  It is to mark this that I have ventured to use the form dwarves, and so remove them a little, perhaps, from the sillier tales of these latter days. Dwarrows would have been better; but I have used that form only in the name Dwarrowdelf, to represent the name of Moria in the Common Speech: Phurunargian_ For that meant 'Dwarf-delving', and yet was already a word of antique form. But Moria is an Elvish name, and given without love."

Side fact to preserve this unique distincton in translations of his work the Elves are called Elben in the german translation (Have other translation also this distinction?)

While I like his use of leitmotifs and a variety of styles and instruments, his Hobbit soundtracks were uninspired and felt more like an attempt to rehash themes from his better LotR soundtracks instead of writing a bunch of new ones. There were a few new good themes, but the soundtracks mostly recycled and re-envisioned his preexisting LotR motifs. Any further Middle-earth soundtracks from Shore would be more of the same, further spiraling into stagnation (though not quite on Hans Zimmer's level of music rehashing).  Just as it's time for someone other than Peter Jackson to try their hand at adapting Tolkien properties, it's time for someone other than Howard Shore to provide the music. The team who made the LotR films should not have a monopoly on what Middle-earth ""looks like"" (and sounds like, for that matter).
