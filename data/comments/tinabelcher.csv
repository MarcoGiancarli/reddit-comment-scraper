tinabelcher,3dw1bt,Lol33ta,3,Mon Jul 20 00:24:54 2015 UTC,Why is this even a gif?
tinabelcher,3dujug,Lol33ta,4,Sun Jul 19 16:49:15 2015 UTC,"Awesome, but I'm sad the skirt went to pants."
tinabelcher,3dujug,annonne,2,Sun Jul 19 20:34:25 2015 UTC,I'm sad she grew her hair out.
tinabelcher,3dsnid,Lol33ta,3,Sun Jul 19 01:56:33 2015 UTC,My crotch itches.
tinabelcher,3dsnid,figureinplastic,2,Sun Jul 19 01:57:26 2015 UTC,Butts! Butts! Butts!  (We need some markups. This should be three inches tall.)
tinabelcher,3dqezz,chalkchick0,2,Sat Jul 18 13:10:45 2015 UTC,On it.
tinabelcher,3dqezz,Lol33ta,2,Sat Jul 18 15:12:01 2015 UTC,Both hands?

tinabelcher,3couzn,chalkchick0,4,Thu Jul 9 16:11:26 2015 UTC,Didn't think this was a gif right away.
tinabelcher,3couzn,Rev_Up_Those_Reposts,3,Thu Jul 9 18:10:17 2015 UTC,Subtle. :)
tinabelcher,3couzn,retconk,4,Thu Jul 9 18:19:34 2015 UTC,I put my cigarettes out in that.
tinabelcher,3couzn,TimeTravelVandal,2,Thu Jul 9 19:49:00 2015 UTC,That coffee is a week old..
tinabelcher,3couzn,retconk,3,Thu Jul 9 23:10:51 2015 UTC,Do you want some cream or sugar?
tinabelcher,3c9nd0,LibraryDiva,2,Mon Jul 6 04:31:49 2015 UTC,"This shirt is for a band called The Acacia Strain, I'm pretty sure."
tinabelcher,3c9nd0,Captain_Blood,1 point,Mon Jul 6 07:41:16 2015 UTC,That gives me an idea.
tinabelcher,3c5age,Lol33ta,2,Sat Jul 4 22:50:41 2015 UTC,The style sorta reminds me of Ren and Stimpy.
tinabelcher,3c5age,enjoythetrees,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:27:55 2015 UTC,And that is why I love it! :D

tinabelcher,3bw3xi,brolea,5,Thu Jul 2 23:06:44 2015 UTC,"I didn't make that Tina, but here are some other random townies of mine - http://imgur.com/a/H5h5l#0"
tinabelcher,3bl658,TenaciousDavid,15,Tue Jun 30 02:57:03 2015 UTC,Holy shit it is Tina
tinabelcher,3bl658,AdultlikeGambino,21,Tue Jun 30 03:32:21 2015 UTC,"Not it's ""Melissa BELL""."
tinabelcher,3bl658,VuDuDeChile,6,Tue Jun 30 07:13:45 2015 UTC,Melissia*   FTFY
tinabelcher,3bl658,H_K_14,12,Tue Jun 30 17:33:11 2015 UTC,Oh thank god this isn't real. Source 1 and Source 2.
tinabelcher,3bl658,lovekeepsherintheair,5,Tue Jun 30 13:37:09 2015 UTC,Holy fuck.
tinabelcher,3bl658,grizzlybearbones,9,Tue Jun 30 04:52:08 2015 UTC,"Oh my goodness, please tell me this is from a comedy show or something? Otherwise surely what she wanted to present should have been vetted and she wouldn't have been allowed to embarrass herself like that. ""Pretty in a way other people don't understand at first""? ""You will get your period soon""? This is several years old and from what I'm imagining of her school life after this, I hope she's ok now."
tinabelcher,3bl658,Yourwtfismyftw,11,Tue Jun 30 12:08:08 2015 UTC,"I responded above, don't worry it was for Comedy Central!"
tinabelcher,3bl658,lovekeepsherintheair,4,Tue Jun 30 13:37:49 2015 UTC,"Another.. https://vimeo.com/120889618 ""and tells strangers she's 43."""

tinabelcher,3bgcfr,Lol33ta,4,Sun Jun 28 23:55:12 2015 UTC,WHAT EPISODE IS THIS?! I don't remember this!
tinabelcher,3bgcfr,DownVoteYouAll,3,Mon Jun 29 03:33:52 2015 UTC,"This year's finale, the water balloon episode."
tinabelcher,3bgcfr,IceCreamSocialist,2,Mon Jun 29 05:08:06 2015 UTC,"I cried from laughing the first time I watched this :,)"
tinabelcher,3awv6k,design-office,4,Wed Jun 24 03:41:21 2015 UTC,Follow the money!
tinabelcher,3awv6k,retconk,3,Wed Jun 24 13:01:22 2015 UTC,Wasn't me. I was right here the whole time... I swear... Really!
tinabelcher,3awv6k,chalkchick0,2,Wed Jun 24 03:53:57 2015 UTC,I can vouch for chalkchick0. I was with her the whole time. There is no way there are two serial butt grabbers.
tinabelcher,3awv6k,chelsmjlv,3,Wed Jun 24 19:27:51 2015 UTC,"A year for each charge?  I mean, it's a violation, sure, but how is spending that kind of money on Tina in the public interest?"
