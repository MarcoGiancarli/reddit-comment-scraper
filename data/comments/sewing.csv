Busted out the Kenmore 10 (~35 years old) and decided to learn how to make one.   First project so be gentle.   Also, what does the knob on the front do?"
sewing,3e0ftv,IronColumn,9,Tue Jul 21 00:23:15 2015 UTC,"Another dude reporting in. I mostly take in my shirts, but I also make backpacks and frame bags for my bikes.   Anyway, pretty sure that front knob is to adjust thread tension   http://www.wikihow.com/Adjust-the-Tension-on-a-Sewing-Machine"
sewing,3e0ftv,IronColumn,2,Tue Jul 21 01:40:48 2015 UTC,Thanks. I actually meant the other one on the front right under the stitch selector
sewing,3e0ftv,Voyeuristicintent,4,Tue Jul 21 01:44:01 2015 UTC,Oh. I have absolutely no idea.
sewing,3e0ftv,just_ron,4,Tue Jul 21 01:45:18 2015 UTC,Yeah hard to find manuals for an almost 40 year old machine. Turns out it was bought in like 1978.
sewing,3e0ftv,highenergycompound,8,Tue Jul 21 01:46:17 2015 UTC,"I did some quick digging and found a diagram from the instruction manual. The manuals are out there, the model number on the back plate should help with tracking down the right one. Congratulations on a fine machine, Kenmores are fantastic beasts. I have a slightly older model, and I have put countless miles on that puppy with barely a skipped stitch. Compared to the brand new Brother Project Runway I destroyed, the older model Kenmores are Cadillacs. To be fair, I abused that poor little machine past it's breaking point with the kind of sewing I do.   Anyway, I believe you are asking about the Stitch Length Adjustor, the numbers on the outer ring represent how many stitches per inch you are sewing. The longer stitch length, 8 stitches per inch, is good for basting(holding two layers together temporarily). I like my standard seams set at 12.  The inner selector modifies the specialty stitches.   Happy sewing!"

sewing,3e0ftv,OffBrandKris,4,Tue Jul 21 02:40:08 2015 UTC,"Welding, woodworking and sewing are the same skill set, I learned that one from the great Adam savage, although he may have heard it elsewhere, I'm trying to find a project for myself this summer maybe a new apron is a good start! Yours is pretty nice looking, I mistook it for a welding apron first!"
sewing,3e0ftv,cyndicate,3,Tue Jul 21 02:29:19 2015 UTC,Thanks. I definitely see the similarities between wood working and sewing. I've always wanted to learn how to weld. Maybe that's next.

sewing,3e0ftv,HobbitLass,3,Tue Jul 21 15:41:32 2015 UTC,"If you're referring to the left knob dealy, it's your thread tension knob (see very basic video here for more info on that). If you're referring to the right knob, it should be your stitch width. Here's a manual that looks pretty similar to that particular machine type. The apron looks great, by the way!"
sewing,3e0ftv,HobbitLass,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:43:21 2015 UTC,Thanks. The width is right under the stitch selector on the front top. The big knob under it from the best I can tell is alternate stitch selection and something else that I don't know.
sewing,3e0ftv,BB_Queen,7,Tue Jul 21 01:45:26 2015 UTC,The top width switch is for zig-zag. The big knob below it is for the length of your straight stitch.

sewing,3e3efc,barfield,12,Tue Jul 21 17:29:26 2015 UTC,"I assume you mean sewing, not seeing?  Some of what you'll get needs to be tailored to her type of sewing (garments, crafts, quilts) but the basics I'd suggest would be electronic controls so less dials to fiddle with, speed control so she can go very slow while she relearns, a knee lifter attachment so she can raise the pressure foot by knee instead of hand, and maybe, if the budget is there, an upgraded foot that can cut the thread for her at the end of the seam.  Good luck b"
sewing,3e3efc,Gelldarc,5,Tue Jul 21 18:10:09 2015 UTC,"I'll second the knee lift as being super important! You will also want the machine to be level with the larger table rather than sitting on top of it.  Take a look at this video of someone using an industrial serger, where the table is level with the machine https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wX2-VLryNlQ ... the extra support they get from the table makes for faster easier work, but supporting the product would probably let one get away with doing things one handed.   Also some of the tools we normally think of in sewing are going to be much harder to use/deal with.   There will be a challenge to cutting, maybe a rotary cutter would be best. Start off with some really heavy weights for holding down fabrics and patterns if your going to go the rotary cutter route.   Pinning and layout with easing is going to be much harder, but might be doable with some effort.  Remember that sewing is a broad concept, if she is technically inclined then the idea of machine embroidery might be something worth looking into --- Its a lot of the same satisfaction of creation but without as much ""hands on"""
sewing,3e3efc,zer00eyz,3,Tue Jul 21 18:47:25 2015 UTC,"Oh, good thought on the machine embroidery.   Embroidering towels, bibs etc. make great homemade gifts and some of the patterns are incredible. Hooping might be challenging, however.  Perhaps a magna hoop system.  Also, a machine with a built in threader is an absolute necessity."
sewing,3e3efc,Gelldarc,3,Tue Jul 21 19:05:22 2015 UTC,"Also, a machine with a built in threader is an absolute necessity. <<< Probably not, having to thread the serger with tweezers is a one handed activity, that mostly involves me cursing. Some large eye needles and a pair of tweezers to get you going would be good. Just buy GOOD tweezers, and buy a few kinds (self closing, bent point)   A top loading bobbin that self aligns/threads would be good too!"

Burda has a couple of examples in their women's collection 1, 2, and 3 (2 and 3 are actually the same pattern, but I'm including both because of the great illustration of how using different fabric yields different results).  Many moons ago, I had a lovely pair of pleated trousers that had a side closure with only a pair of trouser hooks (slides? I've forgotten the proper term). The main opening was hidden by/incorporated into the pocket."
sewing,3e0z09,JBJeeves,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:13:13 2015 UTC,"Well the first reason is that it takes more fabric so it'll never be done in fashion manufacture (more fabric = $$). You can't make waist alterations through the CF, so .... that's not really a thing (sorry!).  Well, no, you could, I suppose, but usually waist alterations also need to take into account butt or hip alterations, and excess curve is usually carried at the sides and back of the body, so it's easier through the side seams and CB.  Too much fussing to alter at the front.    thinks more  It would make the waistband bulkier as well, since the placket is wider.  Also, you'll have a loose flap of fabric floating around at the crotch - you won't be able to topstitch it down, like a fly front, because the pants will go skew-y.  But it would certainly solve the unzipped fly issue."

sewing,3duf1x,lynaevm,48,Sun Jul 19 19:09:02 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry to come in here as a downer when this is supposed to be a lovely, welcoming community, but they look quite cheap, and they don't look better when being worn. How can you be happy with those messy seams visible on the outside? The side seams look like they're about to burst, they definitely should not be that visible on the outside and make me question your fabric/stitch choices.. If you're going to attach the black pieces like that, doubled over, why not take a little more time and encase the raw edges of your pink fabric inside the black edging instead of just whizzing them on, like a proper waistband? A little patience and care when sewing goes a long way, especially when you're making a tutorial for the world to see/use. People commonly buy underwear instead of making them because they're finished using an overlocker, feel comfortable, look flattering, and don't look like they'll fall apart after one use.  Moreover, I must express my frustration over this, but why does every newbie underwear tutorial advocate for synthetic fabrics while making sure to leave out the panty pocket/lining/gusset inside, something that is not made for people with sensitive skin, but because the vagina is a delicate area that requires it? It allows for breathability. Lack of air flow around the vagina and urethra can lead to bacterial growth or fungal growth. Bladder infections and yeast infections suck. I can't imagine that seam rubbing up against that area is very good for the ladybits, either."
sewing,3duf1x,mmcnama4,11,Sun Jul 19 23:15:34 2015 UTC,"Making underwear can be fun and cheap and I'm sure you'll get better with time, but these suggestions are good ones.  A cotton lining is super easy to install and there are ways of adding the bindings that will add less bulk, always desirable in underpants.  But it is a fantastic, low-investment instant-satisfaction way to get better at knitwear!"

When she started teaching me about machine sewing at age 8, she bought one of those $30 ""kid"" sewing machines from American Girl that doesn't move as fast, so it wouldn't be scary and it'd be less likely that I'd hurt myself.

sewing,3duv8s,foufymaus,2,Sun Jul 19 19:35:28 2015 UTC,"Agreed -- the price seems too high for a model that probably has plastic gears inside. It may be in working condition now, but if (when) those gears crack it's very unlikely that they'll be replaceable.  OP, I would suggest that you hold out for something which is all metal inside. For Singers that means slightly older models. Other manufacturers may be different; for example I've heard that Kenmore-branded machines were all-metal well into the seventies."

sewing,3duv8s,confluence,2,Sun Jul 19 21:53:34 2015 UTC,"I searched for other sewing machines on the same site to see if I could suggest some other possibilities. I'm restricting my comments to models I know enough about to be able to recommend:   This is a late model Singer 99. It's straight-stitch only, but I believe this sub-model has reverse. It's also electrified and comes with a carrying case and a box of accessories. It uses class 66 bobbins, which are pretty easy to find, standard needles, and common low shank attachments.  This is the model I learned to sew on (and mine doesn't even have reverse), so if you're OK with the lack of zigzag it's definitely an option. This White is a clone of a Singer 15. It should use class 15 bobbins (the most common type), standard needles and low shank attachments. Also straight stitch only. Seems like a safe bet. Here's another Singer 99, in a table. This is a Singer 201. Also straight stitch only. This one looks like it needs a bit more TLC and has a missing plate.  Class 66 bobbins, standard needles, low shank attachments. Another Singer 99 and two buttonhole attachments. Seller ""not sure"" if machine still working. From its condition I'd guess that it is, but the price seems a bit steep for a potentially broken machine. You could ask to test it before you buy it. The buttonhole attachments are pretty useful; I have one. A Singer 15 in a table. May need a service. Singer 15 in a case. Needs a pedal. It may be easier just to replace the whole motor."

It says it was updated 4 hours ago so hopefully it is!    I grew up around my mom sewing, and fiddled around with the big plastic sewing machine she had. I never liked using it and ended up hand sewing a lot of stuff. It could have been because the sewing machine was hidden in the basement too.

The closest is the mohair coat or the belted wrap coat. For best accuracy, you would cut the collar off both coat patterns (see your reference), and join the front pattern pieces for the mohair coat. You would then lessen the angle of the font diagonal opening of the coat for the bottom piece of the pattern (to only slightly greater than 90 degrees), but increase the angle of the cut off collar so that the part of the pattern you cut off for the collar fits the new circumference of the large neckhole. Then you would cut the triangular decorative inset for the back.   I don't think the decorative inset provides much shape (the pattern pieces fit into one another exactly when the pattern is flat. However, the new collar inset (as I tried to describe above) does provide additional shaping to the pattern in the form of an increased collar circumference. Hence, while in the Burdastyle patterns I provide the collar is very close to a rectangle, the pattern for the collar in the reference image is more funnel-like. IMPORTANT: the only shaping that provides the funnel is in the front and possibly the center back for the collar--nowhere else."

I refurbished a White Rotary machine with the latter mechanism, and found that the rubber was smoothed and would grip the shaft wheel poorly. A bit of roughing with a rasp and it works perfectly."
sewing,3dp9be,PipeOrganEnthusiast,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:37:27 2015 UTC,"Well, are you sure it isn't set to thread a bobbin?  Assuming it's one of those black cast iron Singers, there's should be a silver screw outside the handwheel. Hold the handwheel still with your left hand, and with your right hand check if that silver screw is loose.  You need to tighten it (clockwise, IIRC) to reconnect the sewing mechanism after you've wound a bobbin. You don't have to screw it in very tightly; just turn until it catches and isn't loose anymore. You loosen it when you want to wind a bobbin."
sewing,3dp9be,confluence,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:10:39 2015 UTC,This. While it's an old machine and probably desperately needs oil and grease if the main shaft is sticking it can cause the bobbin winder to be partially engaged causing this to occur.   It's definitely a good idea to check the motor and brushes as well.   These old singers are basically indestructible short of the insides rusting and fusing together so it's probably in desperate need of some tlc.

sewing,3dsyft,jlhepburn,3,Sun Jul 19 03:53:24 2015 UTC,"This is probably a terrible fabric for this skirt.  There is a reason an awful lot of patterns say ""Not suited for obvious diagonals"" on them.  If you cut it out normally, there will be no way you can make the fabric match prettily across that center front seam, which will be distracting as all heck.  If you do as you suggest and cut it so that the stripe of the skirt goes straight down the panels on the grainline, you will have to perfectly match each seam to get a nice chevron, which may or may not be possible in your fabric and will probably take more yardage.    Also, this will fundamentally change the shape of the skirt.  Where the straight grain and the bias of the fabric fall on a semi-circular skirt like this determines where the fullness is.  Changing that might make the skirt hang strangely flat at the sides with a lot of extra droop center front right where you don't want it -- or the exact opposite. OR, since you can't even use even biases, it might hand differently on one side than the other.  You'd also have to stabilize the waistband differently, the pockets would fight you back....  It isn't impossible. It might even come out alright in the end.  But PLEASE make this skirt out of a fabric that won't make you hate yourself first.  If you love the skirt and understand how it works, you'll have a much better feel for if you really want to try it on the bias."
sewing,3drltl,kerrington83,2,Sat Jul 18 19:58:17 2015 UTC,"I dunno, it's something I generally accomplish through trial and error. Separate the 3-D object into its composite 2-D shapes (like how a cube is made up of six squares, only obviously a bit more complex than that) and play with proportions until you get it right. For example, the pig's forehead is a fan shape with a dart in the top and the cheeks might be circles with a dart in the bottom for shape (hard to say from the picture, I almost feel like they would need darts in two sides, but I don't see any in the pic). If you're self drafting, you'll need to measure each peice against the others to make sure that they'll all work together. I also like to sew work like this by hand, that way if I find I need to make little adjustments I can just do it as I go instead of having to go back and recut. I don't know if any of this makes sense. What are you having problems with specifically?"
sewing,3drltl,impendingwardrobe,2,Sat Jul 18 21:49:59 2015 UTC,"I really want to learn to self draft. I have given up on the gussets, they just never look right. I have been trying to do the faces, and the just looked awful. You have helped! I never though about putting in the darts.  With the sheep head, I can get the front right, but not the sides/back. Mine all look flat.  Thank you!"
sewing,3drltl,impendingwardrobe,2,Sat Jul 18 22:04:33 2015 UTC,"I would do the sheep's head in three pieces, two rounded tear drop type shapes for the sides and a strip running from the top back of the head to under the chin that gets gradually wider starting at the nose and moving up the forehead, and stays the same width at the top and moving across the back of the head to where the head meets the rest of the body. It should round out when you stuff it."
sewing,3doz6o,Glamourai,10,Sat Jul 18 01:50:50 2015 UTC,Very nice. I'm slightly glad someone else has issues with reading McCalls directions.   I had to read 7 steps over 10 times and make assumptions to make a veil.
sewing,3doz6o,Dried_Apple,3,Sat Jul 18 03:26:48 2015 UTC,"My heart was racing the whole time with those stupid McCalls instructions!  SO MANY STEPS.  It was a Palmer/Pletsch pattern and what makes it even more maddening is that it said, ""this is a NO-FAIL welt pocket!  TRUST US!""  Yeeeeeah, nope."
sewing,3doz6o,OsoPretty,3,Sat Jul 18 06:50:20 2015 UTC,That is the MOST amazing thing!! I love learning new things. I'm delighted to have seen this tutorial. I'm so sorry you had to do the pocket twice.
sewing,3doz6o,whyiamiwastingmytime,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:05:32 2015 UTC,The tutorial is GREAT!  What sucks is I sprung for super nice $20/yd fusible hair canvas for the interfacing and I didn't have any extra to make up for the extra pieces I had to redo.  Since the facings are still hair canvas I'm settling for plain ol' Pellon fusible interfacing for the recuts.  SO SALTY.
sewing,3doz6o,whyiamiwastingmytime,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:53:38 2015 UTC,"Hair canvas is usually not used to interface pockets. Regular, light interfacing is.  I also can't say I've seen fusible hair canvas, the kind I've bought had to be attached with hand pad stitching, but in any event, it would be used on a jacket front."
sewing,3doz6o,spsprd,2,Sat Jul 18 16:50:49 2015 UTC,Yeah my entire front is interfaced with it (making a blazer).  It's really nice stuff but I do suspect that it complicated the pocket considerably.  The original pocket was just way too narrow/thin to accommodate all the unnecessary layers.
sewing,3doz6o,b3aker,3,Sat Jul 18 17:33:37 2015 UTC,"Oh, I see. Thank you. Anyways, the pocket looks nice."

sewing,3doz6o,Dead_leaf,3,Sat Jul 18 17:06:24 2015 UTC,"Mind you, I'm a very experienced seamstress.... but when I use a pattern (rarely) I make sure I read all the instructions through, start to end, once to make sure that they don't have anything weird and tricky going on. Then I ignore them and do things my way or use my old vogue sewing book. Because for the most part, you sew a bodice the same way every time, you can set the zipper whichever way you choose.... screw them and their crappy instructions!  Plus, I tend to sew things in a much more efficient fashion -- I put zippers in before seams, I railroad sew as many seams as possible before moving over to the ironing board, little things like that"

I was in the market for a new machine but a Bernina is so far out of my price range that I wasn't even aware of the brand. I stopped by the garage sale on a whim, saw what looked to be a sturdy machine with lots of accessories at the right price so I bought it. I didn't realize what I had till I got it home and looked it up.  So now I have to become much better at sewing to earn the privilege  of owning this machine."

You do have the option of building a large ""box"" to deaden the sound it makes. You can construct the box frame out of PVC pipe, wood or anything else. Fabric + batting would be a good start but all kinds of things will dampen sound. Some folks have had good luck with egg foam.  The 3d printing community has the same problem as you and a few folks have built their own solutions to this same problem (3dprinter sound damper would be a good start on google).

I've got two such skirts on my sewing table right now. They'll both go to a friend who's wild about the colors/fabrics. One of the skirts, I found that I just couldn't be bothered to pick apart when it didn't fit properly. I also discovered that I was only in love with part of the print, not all of it, and to re-size the skirt, I'd have to spend A LOT more time faffing about, adding seams, so I could cut away the parts I didn't like rather than cutting away the parts I did). The other skirt, which has yet to be actually stitched up, I've decided is just too short on one side and, unfortunately, there's nothing to be done about it. It'll be perfect for my friend: she's a couple of inches shorter than I am and she has much better legs than I do. :)  Otherwise, I've been known to donate stuff to the local charity shop.

sewing,3dokw0,MetalMarthaStewart,2,Fri Jul 17 23:40:24 2015 UTC,"It sounds like your timing may be off. You can either look for some youtube videos on how to fix the timing yourself or you can bring it into a repair shop and have the timing adjusted along with a lil tune up (won't be terribly expensive and is a good idea for a used machine). I've tried fixing the timing on my own machines but I've never been successful (despite being generally handy and a seamstress by trade) but YMMV, maybe your machine will be an easier fix :)"
sewing,3dokw0,hebephreniac,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:54:35 2015 UTC,One sign of the timing being off is the needle hitting the bobbin case or making any kind of tapping or metallic ting as you move the hand wheel.
sewing,3dokw0,hebephreniac,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:55:32 2015 UTC,Try taking the bobbin out of the case and turn it around so the thread comes off in the opposite direction. There is also a tension screw on the bobbin case you can fiddle with.
sewing,3doj5z,sardonicsmirk,3,Fri Jul 17 23:25:19 2015 UTC,"Depending on the type of snap, it could just be prongs penetrating the fabric, or there could be small holes cut with a post going through the hole.    A hole shouldn't be a big problem on the button hole side, but on the button side it could be a problem and require a facing or some sort of patch.  The only way to know for sure is to pry the most inconspicuous snap off.  If the fabric is messed up, put another one back on in its place.  If you're unable to separate the snap pieces on each side it'll be a no go too."

sewing,3dnwsz,sinisukka,2,Fri Jul 17 20:23:06 2015 UTC,I think just cutting the fringe would look great. You could also add a contrasting piping if you want a little extra detail.  You could also stitch another fabric on the front panel or on the rest of the purse so you are leaving some purple.

sewing,3dnwsz,cccccchicks,2,Sun Jul 19 14:43:33 2015 UTC,I wouldn't be worried about the bag looking boring whatever you decide as it is such a lovely bold colour.  Cutting the fringe to about an inch would make it a lot more subtle without risking tiny little stubby bits that could be left if you trim it off completely. I'd remove the tassel string but leave the loop to which I'd  attach a decorative key or two (perhaps one of those trolley-coin things) or hand sew on a velvet ribbon bow or some flowers or something.
sewing,3dnwsz,cccccchicks,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:05:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Maybe i'll cut the fringes first only partly and then all off, if it still looks bad.

Threading is super easy, which direction the bobbin should go is embossed on it.

Having said that if your going to be making basic apparel then by all means buy it. It will work like a champ as long as you treat it well and don't feed it anything too heavy!  Lastly what ever you spend on the machine you should plan on spending at least that much in other items as well. Sewing scissors for cutting, marking tools, rulers, seam gauges, a good iron + board, a ham... it will add up pretty quick."

sewing,3djia0,AmberHeartsDisney,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:53:21 2015 UTC,"That's a good question. My best idea would be to take the measurements of normal king sized sheets (108"" x 102"" from what I understand) and buy some fabric adding about 6 or 7  inches to each side. If you wouldn't want to try to do that, you might be able to do it with California king sheets. Or you can get creative and sew two king sized sheets together for each part of the duvet (so you'd use 4 sheets total). You'd definitely end up with a lot of fabric to cut off at the end, but at least you would have a duvet that fits! I hope this helps!"

Can you drop the feed dogs on your machine? Thats how I darn anything. Drop the dogs, and lower the presser foot pressure so you can move the fabric yourself, like free-motion embroidery.  It doesn't help with the problem you're having with your darning setting, but it's an alternate method you could try."
sewing,3dj356,meow_reddit_meow,12,Thu Jul 16 17:59:15 2015 UTC,"1.5M+(T*R) = price  M = cost of materials T = time spent R = hourly rate     That's the formula I use. If you are supplying the materials (and by materials I mean matching thread, zippers, buttons, elastic, or whatever else is needed to make the dress in addition to fabric), I knock off the 1.5M and just charge an hourly rate. How much I charge depends on a few factors -- what type of fabric it is, if you're a friend/family, how complicated the pattern is, if there's any design work or substantial alterations to the pattern to be made, for starters. My standard rate is $30/hr, and a nice dress with lining that's not very long or complicated will take around 4 - 6 hours.   But all that doesn't matter, because I'm not the one who would be making your dress. So go find somebody local and talk to them about a custom commission for this dress, and what cost you're looking at."

sewing,3djghm,PriceZombie,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:35:51 2015 UTC,That seems too heavy and my machine might not handle it i think.   I think you are right. A home sewing machine isn't meant for upholstery.
sewing,3djghm,Swedophone,2,Thu Jul 16 19:54:25 2015 UTC,"This review would seem to indicate otherwise, one of the reasons i bought it.    http://www.best-home-ideas.com/2014/08/brother-sc9500-review.html    The machine does an equally good job with multiple layers and single layer of fabrics. It worked quite well on 4 layers of upholstery, so it must hold up good on heavy fabrics. The stitch quality on this machine is nice and consistent. The decorative stitches look quite good."
sewing,3djghm,Mo77019,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:58:24 2015 UTC,"I said 12 layers in my other reply, but it's actually 11 layers of canvas no problem, or if I'm doing a lined bag with quilting cotton with single layer straps it's 14 layers plus sometimes 2-4 layers of interfacing.  Even more than that on occasion that I've had to hand crank the wheel to get over.  Curtains with tex40-70 thread will be no issue at all."
sewing,3djghm,Mo77019,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:54:07 2015 UTC,"id be doing a max of 3 layers i think.   A UV protecting cloth on the back, and a folded over hem.  Will check out #18 needles, and Tex 70, if i can find it.  Where do you buy your thread?  I think im missing something obvious, but any of the thread i can buy doesnt seem to have any sort of weight label on it at all.  Locally there seems to be clark and coats and thats about it."
sewing,3djghm,Mo77019,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:08:16 2015 UTC,"There are several weight schemes which make it confusing, and I've just seen it labeled as all purpose, embroidery or heavy weight at places like Jo-anns.  There are also schemes based on how many strands are in it and their weight, so I've just stuck with Tex.     The standard is moving towards Tex, but that will probably be as fast as the U.S. moves to metric...  The number is how many grams 1000m of thread weighs, so tex 100 is five times as heavy as a tex 20 serging thread, etc.  I get most of my thread at Wawak. I've stuck with Gütermann for consistency and after being turned off by some cheap thread that clogs up the bobbin case in 20 minutes.   Edit: remember a double food hem of a lined curtain is actually 6 layers, 3 of the main and three lining.  When you cross the side hem, there will be another 6 layers.  It won't be a problem, but it will be a bump, but probably not so big that you need to hand crank the wheel."
sewing,3djghm,zer00eyz,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:23:25 2015 UTC,"Awesome!  Wawak has information on the Clark and Coats stuff i can get locally too that gives its Tex weights.   I couldnt find that anywhere, including on clark and coats site.     And yep, you're totally right about the 6 layers, I wasnt thinking.  Im new to all this."
sewing,3dj54o,icftwltv,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:13:14 2015 UTC,"One of my best friends is an professional yarn dyer, this is what she has in her studio. She's had it for about ten years now, and it's still going strong.   The Nina one from Dharma looks really similar though, what problems are you having with it?   Edited to add, I found this review of washer/dryer alternatives and it's got some tips for making a spinner work better. The blogger ultimately had to return the spin dryer as it stopped working and she had trouble with the replacement too. Weird."
sewing,3dj54o,kateyj,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:40:32 2015 UTC,The dharma one is just too wimpy for daily heavy use.  The cover is supposed to operate the spinner when you close it but that crapped out in no time.  It has to be perfectly balanced or it won't work.
sewing,3dj54o,kateyj,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:43:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's definitely true about balancing the load.   Is it possible that there's too much in it? I know that my friend only puts about a pound (dry weight, it's actually much heavier when it goes into the machine) in hers at a time. If you're not overloading it and/or are able to put less in, then it might be worth it to source a washer that you can use for spinning (but that has plumbing requirements, I know, so it might not work). I've seen working used washers go for around $100-$200 if you have the space/setup.  Wish I were more help. :-/"

sewing,3di8hm,woo545,5,Thu Jul 16 14:09:01 2015 UTC,"The easiest thing to do is to get this: http://www.amazon.com/Warm-Company-Steam---Seam-Fusible/ Get an iron and something to iron on, like an ironing board. Turn the iron on high and after a few minutes touch it to a small piece of the Gi's hem. This will tell you if your Gi can handle the high temp. If it doesn't melt, good. If it does, back the iron temp by about 1/4 of the dial. Then fold the hem of your Gi to the inside> You probably saw that in the tutorial. Press the hem up the amount you need to shorten, just to get a crease. Then take the paper off one side of the Steam-a-seam and place it in the folded hem so it's straight. Then fold your hem up so the SAS is sandwiched in between and iron the shit out of it. Iron the hem about 10 or so inches at a time and follow the directions on the SAS. If you do it right, the SAS will hold until you lose interest in Karate. JK!"
sewing,3di8hm,Anne314,3,Thu Jul 16 15:21:16 2015 UTC,"will hold until you lose interest in Karate. JK!   Probably not as much of joke as you think! I only joined to support my friend. His 3 kids have been going there (his eldest for 7+ yrs). However, in the end, I'm enjoying myself and getting in shape. So, who knows!  Thanks for the info! ""Easy"" isn't necessarily a priority here. Though, that does look cool. I'll definitely consider it. I can always do some stitching afterwards to get the look down, correct?  The Gi is ~50/50 Polyester and cotton."
sewing,3di8hm,Anne314,3,Thu Jul 16 15:53:58 2015 UTC,"You can stitch after ironing, but this stuff really holds. If you have an old shirt or something that is also 50/50 poly/cotton, try it out on that first. Otherwise, you just need hand needles that have a fairly small eye. Look for darning needles, they are fairly long. and get some all-purpose thread that matches your Gi. Those and a pair of scissors, are really all you need because you can still press your hem so you don't need to pin it. And if you don't buy pins, just use paperclips or binder clips."
sewing,3di8hm,Anne314,2,Thu Jul 16 17:10:17 2015 UTC,"The only reason I would consider stitching after would be for presentation. Since it's a ""uniform"" I'd want to maintain the appearance. The paperclips sound like a good idea. I have tons of them, but I'm not adverse spending $1 on pins either (on a side note, Amazon's pricing is amusing: $1 for one box. $10 for 2). BTW: what kind of stitching do I need to look up?"
sewing,3di8hm,Laureril,2,Thu Jul 16 19:15:05 2015 UTC,"A hem stitch. But the whole point with hem stitching by hand is that it should be invisible. If you want the hem to show, that will require a sewing machine."

I know most people are against cheap machines because they don't last, but I don't plan on making this a full time hobby. It's just as much to learn it for the sake of learning and being able to say I can do it.   So basically, look into a back stitch or a double running. Or use a machine's lock stitch. Thanks again!"

sewing,3desuz,BobbinsABlazing,3,Wed Jul 15 18:34:43 2015 UTC,"Most vintage Singer models use a standard 15x1 needle; only a few do not. Each of the most popular models had various submodels over time which introduced incremental improvements, like electric motors or a more advanced stitch length dial (older models didn't have reverse; newer ones did). Models which have reverse are also likely to have been sold with a motor originally.  However, most models from this era can trivially be converted between treadle, handcrank and electric motor.  There is a boss at the back of the machine where either a motor or a handcrank attachment can be screwed on (or the machine can be put in a treadle table). So if you find a machine which is perfect except for the motor, buy it, buy a separate handcrank attachment, and either sell the motor or keep it in case you change your mind.  This won't work for a machine so old that it has no boss, a vintage submodel with an internal motor rather than an external belt motor (avoid those; they can't be replaced), or a machine so new that it has no boss (after a certain point most domestic machines were made with internal motors). You also can't put a handcrank attachment on a machine which has a solid wheel rather than a spoked one, because the finger of the attachment has to engage with the spokes.  Here are the models I see most often in classified ads where I am. They all use standard needles and low shank attachments, and are straight-stitch only. Any of these would probably be fine:   the 99 -- this is the machine I have; I can personally recommend it. Neither of my two 99s have reverse; I haven't really missed it. It uses class 66 bobbins, which are different to the most common class 15 bobbins but still pretty easy to find. Its bigger cousin is the 66, but these were mostly found on treadles. Very old 66es may have back-clamping feet; an old and abandoned standard. The 185 is a 99 in an updated aluminium chassis. the 128 -- the newer generation of the 28. It has a vibrating shuttle bobbin driver mechanism, which is very old and uses hard-to-find elongated bobbins. A friend has one; it was simple enough for her small children to learn to use in an evening. I think these never got a reverse.  Its larger cousin is the 127 (or 27); also usually found on a treadle. I'm including this because it's so common, and it's not a terrible choice, but the bobbin type is a bit of a drawback. the 15 -- has a vertical bobbin case similar to many modern machines; uses class 15 bobbins. Beware; there was a model with an internal motor. You can find modern replicas of these made in various Asian countries and sometimes sold as ""vintage"". Reports vary as to whether some or all of these replicas are as good as actual vintage machines. If there's no serial number plate on the bed, it's not original. The replicas have a modern-looking serial number on the edge of the bed which is visible when you lift the machine on its hinges. the 201 -- class 66 bobbins in a horizontal case. This also had a submodel with an internal motor. Later models had an aluminium chassis which looked different.   Depending on where you live, you may also be able to find clones of these models made by other manufacturers -- for example, a lot were made in Japan after WW2.  They are often sold cheaply because people have no idea what they are, but I've heard that they're good quality machines. Early clones are very similar to the models they're based on. Later models diverged more and introduced zigzag. If you manage to find one which has a belt motor and a spoked wheel, you may be able to convert it to a handcrank.  You can find some pretty comprehensive information about different Singer models here and here.  You can identify Singers by serial number here. You can download manuals here."

sewing,3desuz,foufymaus,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:29:05 2015 UTC,"Confluence nailed the answer, I collect vintage singers and by far the one I use most is the 201 in this shape http://www.singersewinginfo.co.uk/images/201k23-360x240.jpg It uses modern bobbins and needles.  The most important thing when buying a older machine is the condition of the moter if it has one.  You can actually buy new ones for very little money as they are still being made. The problem is that they are not earthed, so if they are faulty the whole machine goes live. They are really simple to check and certify but you must get it done."

sewing,3ddgx6,2step2dmb,3,Wed Jul 15 12:20:31 2015 UTC,"It looks pretty simple.  Fabric: home decor fabric. Since you want it soft to bend but still strong enough to handle feet.  Sewing: I would take a piece of fabric twice as wide as you want it, fold it in half and sew leaving a hole big enough to turn. Then turn it right side out and top stitch. Then fold the ends over and sew so that it's a casing for the rods so that they fit snuggly.  Rope: heavy duty cording. Also home decor land. I think 1-2 inch thick. It will probably just have to be something you have to look at.  Wood: looks 1-2 inch square. I would think maybe a foot long. It's hard to tell from the picture.   Sliders: I would take 2 wooden ovals and drill holes in them big enough for the cording.  Hooks: I'm kind of lost on those. At first I thought those clamps that keep table clothes on tables but they might not be strong enough. So it might be something you have to try.  I really hopes this helps. Good luck!"

sewing,3ddgx6,zer00eyz,2,Wed Jul 15 18:09:49 2015 UTC,"The rope is a bigger deal than you think:  The wrong kinds of rope have a LOT of stretch in them, and its just going to cause everything to sag under weight.  The technical term for it is ""creep"" and your going to want to look for something that claims to have a low creep. These are mostly braided ropes!   As for the ""hooks"" your going to have to shop around, but you might be able to get away with ""over door"" hooks! A trip to the local home depot might give you some help on that front as well!  Lastly the wood. You might be able to get away with 3/4 inch oak (comes square cut). You will probably have to sand, break the edges while sanding so they don't have sharp corners and finish. You could probably choose a spray on finish for ease of application!  Good luck and let us know how it turns out!"

sewing,3dactz,goldicecream,5,Tue Jul 14 19:05:05 2015 UTC,"What brand is the sewing machine?  You could check for a manual online. Most machines use the same type of needle, so unless there is a dealer nearby, I'd find a local fabric store and get a packet and try them. While I was there I'd sign up for their mailers as they frequently have patterns for 1-2 dollars.  Get a couple simple ones and make stuff.  Knits can be harder to sew, but they are also more forgiving for fit. Use lots of pins and don't stretch the fabric when sewing or cutting (unless it says to in the instructions). A lot of stores have classes, but also community colleges frequently have evening ""hobby"" classes that can be useful.  Around here they sometimes have a ""bring your pattern and we help you make it"" as a class.   Or watch online or read books.  Find a local meetup group.  It does help to have someone to help you with the stuff you haven't thought of & how to deal with mistakes and fitting issues.  but in the long run it really is as simple as get a cheap pattern, get cheap fabric, & sew.  You  make mistakes and figure out what not to do next time.  Oh, thrift stores and garage sales can be a great place to find cheap patterns, fabric, and notions.   But - while it is good to use cheap stuff to make mistakes on, in the long term, quality matters.  for example, cheap thread is rarely worth it and cheap satin impossible to sew and frays out easily."

In addition to the teaching in regard to the machine, there are many other aspects of sewing: Layout, pinning,cutting, pressing, trimming, etc.  Don't underestimate the value of having someone watch you work.  I wouldn't start with a t-shirt, which usually is sewn with knit fabric, but with a skirt, which uses a woven.  A woven is easier to handle."

sewing,3dati0,rotating_pineapple,2,Tue Jul 14 20:58:02 2015 UTC,"Maybe posting a picture would encourage suggestions? I would try doing the wide shoulder adjustment you mention with pivot points, and get the pattern such that the shoulders fit. Then, I might use a french curve to smooth the armscye such that it is less ""wonky."" I'm not sure I can be more specific without seeing the ""wonkyness."" If you don't have  a french curve, I think you can print them out from the internet.   Just remember that changing the armscye also might change the circumference of the sleeve (on the sleeve pattern piece--the top curve)--especially if you need to lower the bottom of the armscye."
sewing,3dati0,babylock,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:22:46 2015 UTC,"I'm on mobile, so pictures are a little tricky. I'll try to describe what's happening with the armscye: normally, it goes in and down from the shoulder at about 10-15 degrees. My shoulder alteration has it going in at about 45 degrees until it reaches the center of the armhole, where it resumes curving at the bottom of the armscye. (It kinda looks like the side profile of a breast, tbh)"
sewing,3dati0,babylock,2,Wed Jul 15 03:51:13 2015 UTC,"What is your cup size?  Sharp angles such as you suggest might need to be reshaped in general, for a better hang (with the french curve), but the problem might be exacerbated if the cup size of the pattern is smaller than your actual cup size.  If I am understanding you correctly, it sounds as if the pattern is too narrow at your overbust/bust measurement, making the armscye cut in too close at the overbust/underbust.  Alternatively, is the shirt too narrow at the sides (just under the armscye too? If so, a larger size might have a wider shoulder, and a wider overbust/underbust."
sewing,3dati0,babylock,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:44:53 2015 UTC,"Bra size: 28DD/30D (Small. To your average consumer, I look like an A cup)  I accidentally printed the pattern ""Fit to Page"" instead of ""Actual Size,"" so that's definitely contributing to the problem. I cut a 6, but it's more like a 2... Oops.  I reprinted the pattern, to scale this time, and it looks more reasonable. However, I still need a good 1.25"" in the shoulder, so the armscye will still be oddly shaped. (Even the largest size, 16, has shoulders that are too narrow) But maybe it won't matter since the bust will be the right size this time?"
sewing,3dati0,babylock,2,Wed Jul 15 13:17:17 2015 UTC,"You will likely have solved your larger problems by cutting the pattern the correct size; however, I might still make a toile (in a knit fabric, if I'm looking at the pattern correctly). I wouldn't be surprised if you needed to alter the curve of the armscye slightly with a french curve (any drastic angles and sharp points tend to be a problem in a pattern, regardless of whether the pattern technically ""fits"" all the measurements).   For example, I have recently dramatically altered a normal shirt pattern (it started off as a merging of BurdaStyle's pdf men's shirt and women's shirt, but now I've altered the collar and back placket to be more like a JCrew shirt and the sleeve to match Outlier's Pivot and added a large bust adjustment). When I tried on my muslin after those alterations, I noticed that the sharp curve of the armscye caused a pleating/rippling effect because it was cut too far inward at the bust (much as you describe). Reshaping the armscye just slightly to smooth and distribute the sharp angle fixed the problem."
sewing,3dati0,babylock,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:04:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your help! I'll definitely make another toile -- luckily, all I've ""ruined"" thus far is some reclaimed fabric from a failed project and a thrifted t-shirt. I think I need to go grab some more cheap fabric and have another go at it, now that I've learned some lessons from my first couple practice shirts. (Lesson 1: buy enough fabric >.<  Lesson 2: stable knit, not flimsy tissue knit. Lesson 3: fix the armscye after doing a shoulder alteration)  I don't currently have a french curve, but I've been meaning to pick one up. Is there a particular one you recommend? (bonus points if JoAnn's carries it)"
sewing,3dapjj,ilovemrmiyagi,2,Tue Jul 14 20:30:55 2015 UTC,Absolutely! Your limited by your own creativity. If you're worried about thinner areas then perhaps consider using batting and a lightweight interfacing underneath the thinner material. I've seen people have success with felt as a lining. Alternatively use the thinner material as decorative patches on top of your thicker material.

If your machine can do a straight stitch and a zigzag stitch, you are good to go. A 3 step zigzag stitch is not necessary, you can use a regular zigzag instead. Start with sewing panties/bikinis to get the hang of sewing with stretch fabric and elastics. What kind of bathing suit are you looking to make. With cups will be more difficult. If it's just for nipple coverage you can buy premade cups to sew in, or make your own out of foam. If it needs underwires it will be more difficult.

sewing,3d8md3,cmunk13,3,Tue Jul 14 23:38:45 2015 UTC,"I've found bras and swimsuits deceptively simple to make, despite their reputation for being impossible.   Ohhh lulu bra patterns are on etsy and very simple, and have dozens of different tutorials in addition to the clear instructions. They also have tutorials for turning them into swimsuits. Really, any pattern works.   Swimsuits yes, you can modify undies and bras and copy a suit you already own for a base pattern. It's what I've done since the beginning.   The hardest part is material acquisition. Bra cups in the right shape require stocking up and often the only well priced ones come in bulk or have slow shopping from China. Etsy also seems to be the best place for these options. Underwire you can get very lucky or unlucky with, same with hooks, straps, and the like. These your best bet will be small shops online, or if you're lucky a local fabric shop.   A lot of your process will be    read instructions  follow instructions with few mistakes instructions require something you don't have wait repeat   Fabrics for suits are nylon Lycra and a second nylon Lycra for the lining. These are gonna be for the best price and variety on EBay or sometimes smaller sites.   Bras can be made out of anything, but stretch fabrics are most recommended.   Really, Id get a pattern and read their list of materials to get an idea of what you will be hunting down and what skills you will need. Usually this is familiarity with elastics, stretch fabrics, and various clasps and fasteners. The rest will be fairly straightforward with a bit of thinking and blind pattern following.   Don't let anyone scare you away, bras are not mystical unconquerable beasts. I actually find them to be easier than dresses, just with many more steps to potentially get lost and lose faith at. Swimsuits are the same."

You could fuse the fabric from the back further to stop the tear from spreading. If you have a dark or matching coloured bias binding, you could use a small strip of that to create a mini facing at the top of the pocket. The line of stitching used to attach the facing should then stop the fabric from splitting any further, especially if you also understitch it. My first thought was bias binding because it's thin and might not add too much bulk, but something on the straight grain, or a stronger trim, might help counteract the strain that your husband must be placing on that top edge."

sewing,3d2lro,puppycat_peon,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:40:27 2015 UTC,"My first Archer about a year ago was my first button up shirt ever and I think the pattern is very doable if you take your time.  I use the Grainline sewalong as my instructions because I prefer having lots of pictures.  The style of the shirt is big and masculine, think 90's era flannel shirts, so I eventually sized down one size and narrowed the sleeves and cuffs.  I think I may do a swayback adjustment with my next one.  My first shirt, straight from the pattern, is still great without the adjustments.  It's a well drafted pattern so it's a good starting point to sewing shirts for yourself."
sewing,3d5dxp,cougarliscious,25,Mon Jul 13 17:37:01 2015 UTC,"Looks like the needle isn't actually puncturing the fabric on some of the stitches, this can be because the spandex is really dense. I would try changing up the needle, maybe a finer needle would be able to slide through the dense fabric more easily. You can also try changing your throat plate/needle plate. Sometimes the throat plate has a slit where the needle enters (so that it can accommodate a zig zag stitch) and you can flip it around or change it out for a plate that has one single hole for the needle to enter. That should support the fabric better and help avoid the fabric getting sucked in. Of course, if you're sewing a spandex fabric like that you probably want to use a zig zag stitch so your seam will stretch. So ultimately I would try a brand new needle which is a finer gauge. It may also help to lubricate your needle slightly to help it move through the fabric, a friend suggested using unscented chapstick for this."
sewing,3d5dxp,hebephreniac,20,Mon Jul 13 17:45:58 2015 UTC,"Wow unscented ChapStick is what did the trick! Holy cow, I swear I learn something useful every day from Reddit.

sewing,3d654i,shenuhcide,3,Mon Jul 13 20:45:09 2015 UTC,"I really don't like to buy fabric online because I can't feel it.  I only buy things that I know exactly what I'm getting (like ...burlap or somesuch)  I would just gather projects and make a day trip to a store.  I live in a small town and I have to make a longer trip, so I just buy once in a while, when the sale are best.  The prices and sales are so much better in the stores.  For example, JoAnn lets you stack coupon codes in the store (like 40% off a single item and 20% off total purchase) where as online, you only get one, perhaps two if you can manage a sale.  Plus, you know exactly what you are getting by being there in store.  Another option is check your Wal-Mart.  Our stores carry fabrics (but I live in the Midwest so we likely have a few things in stock that aren't of interest elsewhere) and the prices are much better than most of the stores, sometimes even better than stacked coupons+sale prices.  They have a smaller selection, obviously, but you can get nice fabrics for $3-$4/yd.  They even have a $1-$2 bin."

A skirt would be made from lighter cottons or a fabric like twill. A tote bag that's sturdy would be made from fabrics like twill or canvas.  Some online stores will send you swatches (samples). I also prefer to buy fabric in the store.

The work we put through them probably isn't good for them but if they die at this point we have gotten more than their cost in use and abuse out of them.  Is the kenmore an upgrade, sure. It isn't a BIG upgrade but its an upgrade. The reality is that in the 150 dollar range there are a TON of solid machines you can buy that have more features and more functions.   Before you buy look at the brother CS600I. If your going for features and stitches its hard to beat what you get at that price ($140 today on amazon). Brother machines are pretty hard to beat if your doing apparel work, but heavier materials and thread do NOT agree with them and will shorten their life.   If your going to do apparel the other big ticket item is a serger. Honestly finishing is so much easier with it, rather than cutting and zigzagging. Depending on what you decide to buy and how much you spend, it can be a very versatile machine! If there isn't a good, compelling reason to upgrade what you have, a serger might be a better investment!"

sewing,3d6321,ambrdst,2,Mon Jul 13 22:13:44 2015 UTC,The thread does look thick or the stitching is SUPER small. I'll second the new needle suggestion too. If you do a project with the needle THROW IT AWAY. Putting a needle back is a just a path to heartache (ok maybe put the double needle back).

The needles I've been using were out of a package that looked unused, but maybe I'm wrong about that.   Where's a good place to purchase needles wholesale? I'm in New York City where the garment district offers a plethora of stuff, but sellers can spot a noob from miles away and definitely charge me full retail plus plus. I usually go to Amazon or the like.   Also, do you have a favorite online thread seller?"

sewing,3d5qi6,justpeachy13,3,Mon Jul 13 19:04:19 2015 UTC,"I would say that dress would be challenging to make as a beginner WITH a pattern, let alone as a beginner drafting a pattern. Knits can be difficult to work with for beginners. You'll need a serger to sew many of the seams and edges to get a nice finish, and a double needle to use in a regular machine to finish the edges.  In my experience my favorite way to draft knit patterns is to use existing knit garments to trace patterns from, then altering them to my liking. I would recommend making a few copies of existing knit dresses and then attempting to tackle this dress."

sewing,3d4eak,adelajoy,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:47:51 2015 UTC,"For a first project, I would recommend picking up some cheap cotton or cotton blend. I made my first skirt out of quilting cotton. Although it doesn't drape perfectly, it was really easy to work with (not slippery, didn't fray too fast, had a bit of body, presses well). Also, quilting cotton comes in a ton of prints and patterns, so you're sure to find something that catches your fancy.   As for patterns, I would suggest finding one that's labelled beginner. I know that fancier things are tempting, but there is a steep learning curve  Besides the buttons down the front, I think the longer version of Colette's Zinnia is pretty well what you're looking for. Sewaholic's Hollyburn is also an easy, longer skirt, but doesn't have the deep pleats.   And as for tips and tricks, I suggest you get really familiar with your iron. Press and iron every single step of the way while sewing.  Edit: I just found Maria Denmark's Paula and it might work well for you."

sewing,3d4eak,KitchenStitch,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:45:54 2015 UTC,"I agree with the others, that you should use a cheap cotton for your first skirt. Some of the first garments I made were pleated skirts, so I think it's a great place to start.  However, this is with the caveat that my first couple skirts didn't look very good.  The ones I wear on a daily basis were my third and fourth pleated skirts.  For a skirt with a lot of pleats, once you've made a cheap trial skirt, I'd recommend cotton blended with a synthetic fiber that is less likely to be incredibly wrinkly. I wear a ton of pleated skirts and I like my synthetic one better than my cotton chambray one because ironing all those pleats is a beast, and it wrinkles like crazy. If you use a less wrinkly fabric, you'll only have to iron it after washing, if at all. A 100% cotton skirt will need to be ironed with each wear if you want it to look crisp.  I make all my skirts without a pattern, so I can't recommend a particular one. There are lots of tutorials online that can walk you through the process.  Feel free to message me if you need help!"
sewing,3d3qfi,10malesics,3,Mon Jul 13 07:37:22 2015 UTC,If it's very large loops it sounds like the bottom thread isn't being held under tension while sewing. I don't know Finesse machines but a quick google suggests that it is a top loading.  You should check that the thread really is being held into the tension clip along the side of the bobbin case - it shouldn't just lie along the top.  If it is correctly held then you could try tightening up the little tension screw on the side of this clip.  Bottom loading cases are easier to check - take the case out and with the bobbin threaded through the case hold it by the thread. The tension should be firm enough that the case can dangle from the thread without unraveling. A light jiggle should allow the case to drop a little.  Once you've got the bottom bobbin under tension then you can adjust the top thread.   This page explains how to thread both types of loading mechanisms.
sewing,3d3qfi,big-mal,3,Mon Jul 13 07:52:02 2015 UTC,"I had this exact problem today. I re-thread the bobbin so many times to try to get it fixed. It was frustrating. Finally, I looked in the manual and read the point about the hard to see part that creates tension. I realized most of the time, I just got lucky that it threaded perfectly. Now I know. At least I knew the large loops/birds nest was an issue with the bobbin!  [edit] This is the step from my manual that I had missed: Hold the end of the thread, push the bobbin down with your finger, and then pass the thread through the slit, as shown. Make sure that the thread is correctly inserted through the tension-adjusting spring of the bobbin case. If it is not inserted, re-insert the thread.  Another thing to check: Are you absolutely sure you are using the right type of bobbin for your machine? They aren't always interchangeable."
sewing,3d3qfi,AuntFlash,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:15:40 2015 UTC,"I have read my manual so many times, I might be able to rewrite it from memory.   I'm using the bobbins that came with it, so I'm pretty sure they're the right ones. They seemed used, so I can't imagine someone just ignoring this issue the whole time they had it."
sewing,3d3qfi,big-mal,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:51:16 2015 UTC,"On this one, you load the bobbin in the bottom, but it doesn't have a case. I thought it was very strange. You have to make sure that the thread is going counter clockwise and then like pull a loop of it through where the needle is, if that makes sense. I can take a picture if that would help."
sewing,3d3qfi,ccspondee,2,Mon Jul 13 08:05:48 2015 UTC,"Yes a pic would help.  I seem to be the only one here at the moment but I am sure you'll get lots more help once America wakes up.  Personally, in all my days, I've never come across a machine with a bobbin that is inserted to wind anti/counter clockwise. Are you SURE that's correct! Because winding in the wrong direction also causes big loops."

sewing,3d2np0,DuckyParts,20,Mon Jul 13 01:07:58 2015 UTC,"Pressing as you sew is an absolute requirement if you want your garments to look their best.  I practically spend more time pressing that I do sewing because every time I sew a seam I press it (oftentimes in garment factories pressers get paid more than sewers because they spend more time with the garment).  I think your skirt looks great and I suspect a good pressing will alleviate the pocket puckering, or at least help you better diagnose the issue.  I think the back zipper is fine, too.  Having the back center seam looks like a design element more than anything.  Get thee to thine ironing board!"
sewing,3d2np0,Glamourai,9,Mon Jul 13 01:23:55 2015 UTC,Absolutely. An iron and a seam ripper are your two most valuable tools as a stitcher. You should make yourself comfortable using either one as often as you need to without worry.
sewing,3d2np0,llamaspitburns,4,Mon Jul 13 01:45:34 2015 UTC,"Not to mention ironing while sewing makes it easier because the pieces fit together easier and seams and such stay out of the way of stitching. But yeah, you may have to sew the pockets shut. The back is fine though."
sewing,3d2np0,Anne314,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:49:57 2015 UTC,"Not to mention ironing while sewing makes it easier because the pieces fit together easier and seams and such stay out of the way of stitching.    Exactly.     But yeah, you may have to sew the pockets shut.    Not sure I agree but it is hard to tell without it being pressed at all. I think that a topstitch on the outside edge of the pocket through the seam allowance may do the trick. A "" ] "" shape might be necessary,  going just a stitch or two over the pocket/side seam line."
sewing,3d2np0,llamaspitburns,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:00:07 2015 UTC,So I'm a beginner to sewing and I picked up a bunch of unlabelled fabric for my next project. I think one is polyester (possibly silk or mix) and the other is vinyl. I'm worried if it would damage the fabric if I press either. Any advice?
sewing,3d2np0,PM_ME_UR_BOOKS,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:02:55 2015 UTC,"With the mystery poly type fabric just keep your iron on a lower setting and test a piece.  A pressing cloth would be a safe bet, too (I usually just use some thicker muslin as a pressing cloth).  Nothing is more rage inducing than nearly finishing a project and your iron melts the fabric in a place you can't hide, ugh.  Vinyl is trickier.  Is it like tablecloth vinyl?  That you can pop in the dryer for a couple minutes and then spread out the wrinkles with a damp washcloth.  If it's more like apparel type vinyl I think the pressing cloth/lowest heat setting would work, too.  Definitely test a piece first and err on the side of caution, I've never worked with vinyl so that's just my best guess.  Good luck!!"
sewing,3d2np0,Glamourai,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:57:52 2015 UTC,Alright I'll definitely give that a try. And its a faux-leather type vinyl for making some boot covers with.
sewing,3d2np0,PM_ME_UR_BOOKS,-1,Mon Jul 13 05:37:57 2015 UTC,"As beginner, you should use fabrics that are easy to work with, such as cotton. If you make a mistake you can remove the stitches without damaging the fabric.  Don't use either polyester or vinyl."
sewing,3d2np0,whyiamiwastingmytime,3,Mon Jul 13 15:51:31 2015 UTC,"The other thing that might help other than the pressing that /u/Glamourai suggested is to use a little bit of light weight double sided fusible interfacing in the top of the pocket to hold the two pieces of fabric that form the top of the pocket and the inside of the pocket together. But mostly, press the crap out of it, then put it back on your dress form and look at it again. The only issue I see with the back seam is that it needs pressed to see if the zipper is set right. Other than that, I love the fabric choice and the big box pleats."
sewing,3d2np0,wife-shaped-husband,2,Mon Jul 13 01:39:38 2015 UTC,"As others have said, you have to press with every step. The reason the back is distracting is because the zipper isn't sewn properly, it's an invisible zipper and is not supposed to show."
sewing,3d2np0,whyiamiwastingmytime,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:49:25 2015 UTC,"If after ironing you find that the pockets still won't lie flat, you could add zippers to close them instead of sewing them up completely. Find zippers with fasteners that match the back zipper; make it look intentional. ;)  The skirt design is lovely; I like the pleat layout. I don't think the back seam is a problem. If it bugs you, in future dress iterations you could hide it inside a pleat."

sewing,3d0s7i,phagocyte,7,Sun Jul 12 15:42:17 2015 UTC,"Yay for simple dress patterns!  Infinity dresses are dead simple -- just two long rectangles attached to a skirt. In most online patterns it's a knee-length circle or semicircle skirt, but nothing is stopping you from making any kind of skirt you want: a floor-length panel skirt, a tiered skirt, etc..  It's very novice-friendly.  You do definitely want stretch fabric, at least for the straps, or you won't be able to wrap them properly.  I once made a dress like this entirely out of non-stretch fabric, but it didn't really work very well, and I ended up taking it apart for other projects.  If you like simple draped dresses, I can also recommend early medieval patterns: e.g. a bliaut or a tunic dress. They can be pieced together entirely out of rectangles and semi-circles, and are also very easy to make.  They may look boxy when they're laid out flat, but they look surprisingly nice on an actual human.  Kimono are also made entirely out of rectangles -- the hardest part is cutting out the collar.  These should be made out of non-stretch fabric. They were traditionally made of wool or linen, but they can also be made out of completely anachronistic thin, drapey fabric, which changes how they lie on your body.  If you like the twenties look, you can attempt something like the one hour dress. Drapey fabric is crucial for this style unless you want to look like a pillow.  And let's not forget the caftan, which is not even a pattern -- it's a huge rectangle with a hole for the head sewn up the sides and with an optional drawstring.  Even more minimalist than that is the Greek chiton, which is... seriously just a rectangle. That you pin on your arms and tie in the middle.  You can make most of these garments a lot more fancy with minimal effort just by making two layers -- something translucent and lacy on top of a more solid underdress or slip."

The first thing you should do is look at pictures of what you like, silhouette wise, and that'll help you choose the fabric. Soft with lots of drape?

sewing,3d2362,turkishjade,2,Mon Jul 13 01:29:07 2015 UTC,"You say you've given up, but if you have some drafting experience, you can pick up Gareth Kershaw's ""Patternmaking for Menswear.""  He outlines a method of using your measurements to create a close-fitting shell, and then a way to use that shell to create a bunch of menswear staples, one of which is a Type 3 Trucker Jacket."
sewing,3d2362,turkishjade,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:59:38 2015 UTC,Have you done it to recommend it? I always get crazy confused by pattern making books and have become wary of buying them
sewing,3d2362,Mo77019,2,Mon Jul 13 13:59:03 2015 UTC,"Long rant ahead:   About a year or so ago, I was asked to make a trucker jacket for a client.   I searched, and K3251 came up.  My client was 5'8"", 41"" chest and 36"" waist.  Average upon average.  The pattern stated he should be a Medium.  I walked the pattern and there would have been almost 8"" of ease in the chest and 2"" of ease in the neckline.  Yikes.  So (I'm referring to my notes) I traced the pattern one size smaller (S) and then:  I shorted the shoulder by 2"".  I shortened the back yoke's neckline by 1"" and armscye by 1.25"".  I raised the armhole by 1"".  I narrowed the front yoke/front by 1.5"" distributed evenly amongst the front panels so the chest pocket would be centered.  I narrowed the back yoke, back by 1.5"" distributed evenly amongst the back panels.  All of this was done before I dealt with the basics like shortening the sleeve, shortening the body and narrowing the collar tip to bring it out of the 80s.  Obviously, this pattern was a mess, but I easily spent 2+ hours making changes and walking the pattern.   About 6 months ago, I picked up the Kershaw book and did 2 patterns from the book.  The slim jean and the trucker jacket, both for myself.   I created the upper body sloper and sleeve sloper and then used them to create the Fitted Denim Jacket pattern.  All told, I spent about 3 hours including getting myself measured by a friend.  I put it to muslin with added seam allowances and about 2 hours later, I had a muslin that was fairly decent.  Maybe another hour of tweeking and it would have been perfect.  Everyone's mileage varies, by I feel like my time was better spent doing the draft instead of modifying such a bad pattern from KwikSew.   I'm not going to lie to you, pattern drafting is pretty hard.  Some books have bad drafts, all of them require you to juggle a lot of numbers, and occasionally, the books skip steps that they think are obvious because they assume you know about drafting theory or are in a class being taught by someone more experienced.  Out of all of the menswear drafting books out there, at least the Kershaw book is current (2014), so the styles are contemporary and it should be fairly easy to get help from the publisher."

sewing,3d2362,coconuthead777,2,Sun Jul 12 22:46:09 2015 UTC,"IDK, there are definitely shirt-jacket patterns.  But this trucker jacket is pretty different from a shirt.  It has a front and back yoke, the plackets are different, and they are on the side seam, which you never see on a shirt, and they are very short, with a waist band.  I got this simplicty 1328 pattern at the $1 sale at jo-anns.  If you leave the bottom slash pockets off, and shorten the length (the body on trucker jackets are shorter than the sleeves), it's kind of close if you restyle the pockets, and bring the sides in for a slimmer fit, and add a band at the bottom, but still no front yoke.  That's a lot of mods..."

It provides lubrication for the gear teeth and the shafts so they don't overheat.  The grease does get flung out of the gears as the machine gets used.  If you can move it back so it's on the gear teeth, and the shaft/bearing sections it will become useful again.  Grease does thicken with age, so if it's more than ~10 years old I would replace it but wouldn't worry if it's younger.  I can't think of anything that'd have a similar consistency to test if it's thickened too much!  Think like really heavy cream that doesn't move on its own, but can be pushed around with a finger.  I wouldn't bother attempting to replace the grease.  There is a concern about finding an appropriate one that won't damage the gears, and that unfortunately depends on what type of plastic they're made from.  Generally, teflon and silicone based greases will work, as they're least likely to attack the plastics but there is no guarantee, sadly.  TBH, for this foray into repairing a toy sewing machine, I'd class replacing the  grease ""too much like hard work"" and just spread it back around as best you can."

Having pins about every inch or two may take longer (since you'll want to stop and pull them out just before they go under the foot- don't sew over them!), but it will keep your curves matched and even.  Also, you can try starting at the top where they need to meet, then sewing down to the brim.  If the brim is a little uneven you can usually trim/hide/hem it, but that's harder to do at the crown.

Some suggestions came to my mind, but I'm a beginner.   Look at the Japanese sewing books on Amazon. I love them! Some have been translated into English. They may be tricky to sew, but the designs are adorable and loose fitting. Most call for cotton and linen, so the fabrics will be soft.   As for seams, they are pretty essential for clothes, but some patterns require fewer than others. There are also different styles of seams, like French seams and abutting seams, that may work better for her.   Making the clothes yourself is going to give you greater flexibility, and you can try different methods and styles to see what your daughter is most comfortable in. I imagine she will love getting to pick out the fabric too! Good luck! I hope you will share your creations with us!"

I had some nice dresses from such a company when I was her age (afraid I can't remember the name) They are designed with extra flat seams where the fabric doesn't overlap. If you can find clothing that is good except for the neck, enlarging necklines isn't too hard on children's sizes or unisex models. I personally find that as long as my collar bones are free, the shape doesn't matter.   I managed to transitioned to jeans as a teen by trying very soft ones with some lycra (and getting used to them at home).

I expect the seams could end up very bulky there, the only thing I could suggest is to try it on a pair you don't mind getting rid of.   another thing to try is flat fell seams. traditionally used on the inseam of jeans, I like them because you sew the seam flat to the fabric and it's a much smoother finish... but seeing as you admit to being a novice, you might not be up to sewing garments and using a different seam than the one intended in the pattern.  About being a novice: I learned to sew out of books I borrowed from my local Library, and further techniques from internet videos, then I started to copy clothes I already had, and then my grandmother gave me a book about pattern drafting, so I started to make my own Simple patterns. Practice and Persistence gets you a lot of places.  I wish you and your daughter luck. I thankfully grew out of most of my sensory issues, but I remember the misery of those days well."

I made a few more later on using pellon 71F instead of fusible fleece, and I like how much sturdier it was.

sewing,3cypfb,aprilsewingjournal,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:16:40 2015 UTC,Double check your threading of both needle and bobbin.  Double check that your needle is inserted correctly.  Some of these old machines may have the needle facing a different way than modern machines so check your manual for correct insertion. Put a new needle in to make sure your needle is not bent.

I also recommend looking at your local ""buy nothing"" group and/or asking to borrow a machine from a friend or relative. It's an appliance so many people have tucked away in the closet and would be happy to loan to a beginner and maybe even teach her the ropes. Then she can either lose interest or by her own machine.

Most other gadgets are not necessary right away.  Recently, I picked up a seam gauge. It cost me ~$3, and it made things so much easier!

If she decides she likes sewing just a little and only uses it for curtains and hemming pants; it's still a good value, it'll last for a decade or more.  I got a very basic Kenmore machine and a sewing class for my 16th b-day. The class was invaluable, I learned the basics of the machine and how to use a pattern.   I recently upgraded to a better electronic machine (Brother) and I wish I had done so sooner. The variety of presser feet it came with make sewing easier. The fact its electronic vs mechanical prevents as many mistakes. If I am attempting to use a certain stitch with the wrong settings it warns me. A huge improvement.

They want to get you into a machine and hooked because they can make good money on selling you some of the super fancy new machines.  I would really encourage your wife to go into a good sewing machine store (Most every area has at least one dealer within an hour drive)  She can sit and play and look at the features.  The folks working there know machines and can help her pick out what she needs. If she buys from a local store, most give free sewing lessons on your machine and discounted classes so she can learn how to sew properly as well.  If it is 100 for a walmart machine or 200-300 for an entry level machine I'd go entry level and the benefits of buying from a store will really add up.

sewing,3cw16x,LovesSewing,2,Sat Jul 11 09:21:22 2015 UTC,"Heads up: This may not be for the faint of heart. Apologies. I've been Frankensteining patterns for several years now and may or may not have forgotten how to use a single pattern to do anything.   1) For the top: TBH, the regular 6 (or 7, if you count center back) princess seams might not give you the gorgeous fitted shape you're rocking in the pic. It's really just an extra side panel on each side. Chop off at the waist to get the shape you're wanting.  2) This skirt, like the one in the pic, is paneled or gored to keep away from the ""OMG 15 MINUTES SUPER SIMPLE"" straight shape used by everybody and their mother. Pockets are SUPER easy to add to almost anything.   3) How is it closed? If zipper up the back or side, skip the lacing and just throw the zipper in there like you would any other seam. I wouldn't do buttons. Too much room for a wardrobe malfunction, and buttoning them all up is annoying anyway.   As far as color: if you're doubtful on the bodice, find a color combo you love and do that. Who said it had to stay black and white? :) Or make a test one and then make a couple more in colors you like. Or make it a top/skirt combo that you can switch out. The possibilities are quite literally endless. Best of luck, OP."

Incidentally, are you wanting to do the zipper straight on or run a placket up the back? (I used to work in wedding gown alterations, so I'm biased toward plackets. w/e)  No but seriously that video tut for pockets--I have used the same technique in skirts I already owned, to add 'em in. Doesn't take much time, and it usually works a helluva lot better than patch pockets. There's also a method that you can use for things like straight trousers and skirts, places where you don't have a pleat--rip about 5 inches where the bottom's sewn to the waistband and attach rectangles on both sides. Sew the whole thing back together, and you suddenly have a very sneaky pocket handy for small flat stuff, i.e. money (harder for a pickpocket to snitch without looking like they're groping you)."

IMO, it absolutely won't hurt the value since it's already been painted green.  A good strip, sand and stain to something like the unfinished area (I'd change out the drawer pulls too) would more than likely increase the value a bit since the furniture would be nicer.  I wouldn't hold onto it just for any possible appreciation.  Keep it because you like it and want to use it, or cash in on your profits now from your purchase price plus the servicing.    That's my take on it, at least..."

But broadly speaking it's a good quality vintage appliance, not a priceless antique.  This is not a rare model, and the machine is not very old.  It's a very good model, and it will probably keep working for decades to come. Keep it if you want to use it, or if you think your children would like to use it. Don't keep it in the hopes that it will appreciate greatly in value; that probably isn't going to happen.  I'm pretty sure this is not an original Singer cabinet; restoring it to a natural wood finish would probably allow you to increase the selling price. People like wood more than they like olive green paint."

You can minimize the chance of a run by extending the darning above and below the holes. And, of course, be careful when you put on/take off the sweater, since that's when the area will be under the most stress.  You could look for a professional re-weaver in your area, to see if the repair can be made more successfully than doing it yourself, but unless this was an awesomely expensive sweater to begin with, I don't think it would be cost-effective."

sewing,3cqa3i,akaghi,2,Fri Jul 10 12:47:35 2015 UTC,"Very well done, especially with the pattern matching.  If you are open to/looking for feedback, I do have a few things you may want to change in the future.  First, I think you should spread the collar a bit. Right now the opening for the tie is a bit too narrow for my taste. It's hard to tell what it would look like on his frame because it is unbuttoned, though.  The body length looks a bit short for a button up. If this were a button down collar, the length would probably be okay; again, it is hard to tell in the photos.  Two pretty minor quibbles, but the fit is great and you did a fantastic job. If you want to make more shirts and want a good resource, David Coffin's Shirtmaking is an excellent resource."

I made the neck edge smaller in line with my other adjustments but didn't quite shorten the collar and band enough. The only thing that I struggled with!   As for the length, it tucks in fine but a lot of the time he likes to wear it untucked and I didn't want too much excess at the bottom. Noted though, thanks!"
sewing,3cqa3i,Mo77019,-1,Fri Jul 10 14:21:24 2015 UTC,"From a fashion perspective, button ups shouldn't be untucked (or unbuttoned, usually*). I like wearing my shirts untucked too, and thus is what a button down collar is perfect for.  It's nothing with the shirt, just a formality clash. Honestly, I only have a couple button ups and I wear them rather infrequently.  Davis Coffin's book is really awesome as he has a lot if small tips and useful info for amateurs. It's really suited to people who maybe sew a bit, but don't have to, but want to make shirts. It's sort of a walk through of how he learned to do it by deconstructing other shirts.  \ So this isn't a hard and fast rule as an unbuttoned collar and even one button can dress down a sport coat. But I would always tuck it in*"
sewing,3cqa3i,waldgnome,2,Fri Jul 10 14:48:40 2015 UTC,"IDK, the collar looks like a perfect semi-spread to me.  That's probably the most common option on this sort of shirt.  I personally dislike wide spreads.    The length looks great for the current style of wearing shirts untucked frequently.  A full dress shirt length looks ridiculous untucked.    I'd lengthen the sleeves 1-2 inches and loosen the cuff button a quarter inch.  But again those are personal taste more than a matter of sewing skill."

I would agree except that this is a button up and not a casual shirt. Make the collar a button down, and the length is good.   I can't think of a person who cares about how they dress that wears a dress shirt untucked.   I'd lengthen the sleeves 1-2 inches   I nearly mentioned this, but with the sleeves bunched up and the arms angled it's hard to tell if they're too short. They likely are for a dress shirt, but a casual shirt is fine not reaching the thumb.  FWIW, I don't think the collar needs to be spread much, just a touch."

When I say I can't think of someone who wears a dress shirt untucked, I'm referring to your standard OTR dress shirt that is billowy and has much longer length meant to be tucked into dress pants.

You are very welcome to abide by them in your own life, but trying to say that is how everyone should do it is impolite at a minimum.  Take a gander in the Macy's (etc.) men's (non-suiting) departments. There are tons of moderate spread, non-button down, stylish shirts with short or straight or split sides clearly designed to be able to be worn untucked.    I personally hate button downs and am glad to easily find many many casual button up shirts without them now as that is almost exclusively what I wear.  I have both of David Coffin's shirt books, and do agree he is a great resource on construction methods and designing collars and plackets, but his style is dated by his own admission.  I'm referring to billowy arms with excessive pleats, and huge tails etc."

There is no reason you need to spend $20 making something that somebody wants you to give them for free when they're not willing to buy the supplies you need for it.  You can always give them a supply list and say you like sewing and would be happy to make it for free as a friend if they provide the materials they'd like used."
sewing,3crggs,RogueGargoyle,7,Fri Jul 10 05:24:01 2015 UTC,"With my other friends who I sew for, I often ask for either an amount that is enough to buy the supplies, or they buy me the fabric and notions needed and I keep the leftovers because it's just a hobby and I don't really exactly care about monetizing it, I just want the cost covered or you pay it forward and buy me something I need.   Is this fair game? Other friends have always respected what I ask for, it's just this dear friend of mine that seems to think 20/yard Clover batting, 11/yard medium weight Japanese cotton is free. I get it that 20 seems slightly expensive compared to one in store, but certainly you can't expect someone to gift it all the time :("

It's likely that the manufacturer and importer are too obscure for you ever to be able to find out more than that.  It's worth whatever someone will pay for it -- look on eBay and in your local classifieds to see what kind of price range is normal.  It should be perfectly usable as a sewing machine. It can only do straight stitch, but it should be easy to get accessories for it (metal class 15 bobbins, 15x1 needles, low shank attachments). It looks like it's in pretty good condition.  You may want to build a wooden base for it, or find a treadle base or cabinet to put it in. It'll probably fit in a Singer treadle.  Since it's pretty much identical to a Singer 15 you can use a manual for a Singer 15 to figure out how to operate it, like this, this or this.  (The 15-30 manual is remastered text with images rather than a scan like the other two, but it's for an older submodel with a different stitch length regulator. Other than that, it should be the same.  The clones often had a more complex pressure screw than the original.)"

Just take a regular dress shirt pattern and align the sleeve into the back armscye. Then cut the back of the shirt into vertical thirds and add a back placket by cutting the shirt back horizontally (don't forget seam allowances).  The pattern works very well. (I made it for myself before Outlier made women's shirts--I wanted the same pattern, but with a bust dart.) The shirt doesn't really add much bulk to the underarm, and instead resists armscye tearing by eliminating the seam at the the part of most stress (at least by me: the lower back 1/4 of shoulder seam), and replacing it with stretchy bias (the pattern is oriented such that it is on the bias--the back side pattern piece and sleeve make a 90 degree angle). It even makes topstitching the shoulder seam super easy, as you sew the sleeves to the back of the shirt first."

The human body likes to bend in a bewildering array of ways and much of the evolution of tailoring has been figuring out new ways to let it move while looking sleek and fashionable.  Now that fashionable is usually sporty, these gussets and cutting tricks are becoming quite visible.  The Outlier shirt already linked is a great example. So is this Duluth Trading Company shirt  that has not only a  sewn in gusset but also a pleat in the armscye.    One thing to remember is that when you are going for greater mobility, armscyes actually need to be fairly high in order to get the pivot point in the sleeve close to the body.  If you want a relaxed armscye, it is usually better to just make sure you have enough body ease and a low enough cap height so that the body can move within the shirt -- this is how the classic camp shirt is cut."

sewing,3ckdos,Leagle_Egal,4,Wed Jul 8 16:22:17 2015 UTC,"This isn't the most sophisticated technique, but I'd probably start with another shirt that fits nicely, and try to mimic it using a new shirt as raw fabric. Maybe lay them both out on a table (have the big one inside out), lining up the collars, and outline (if you're confident, use pen, if it's a dark shirt, use chalk or soap) or pin a copy of the sides and sleeves of the smaller one on the big shirt, then from there sew the new seams shut. I'd wait to cut anything until you've tried it on, so you can start over if it's not right. Make sure you leave a little seam allowance when you do your outlining or pinning so you don't wind up sewing too close or cutting too much off."
sewing,3ckdos,lilygrass,2,Wed Jul 8 17:09:47 2015 UTC,"This is pretty much as sophisticated as you need to get. The only further suggestions I'd make is to make the pattern on paper -- it'll be easier to work with for multiple shirts, and you can make the pattern symmetrical by folding the paper and the shirt before tracing.  I use two pattern pieces -- one for the body (front and back the same, except I'll cut a lower neckline in front) and one for a sleeve. Cut the body out of the body (lining up the shoulders) and the sleeves out of the sleeves.  You can either keep the original finished neckline, or cut it to be wider.  You can extend the length of the shirt to the original bottom, or make it shorter.  Similarly, you can also either scale the sleeves down or extend them to the full length of the original sleeves, keeping the finished ends.  You just need to finish all the raw edges off afterwards, unless you want to leave them raw as a deliberate fashion statement. ;)  I usually just fold and hem the bottom and the sleeve ends (because they're straight edges), and use a strip of fabric (e.g. cut from the bottom) to bind the edge of the neckline (which is curved).  You could just use a single pattern piece and keep the original shoulder seams where they are, but then you'd end up with shoulder seams in the middle of your upper arms, and the grain of the fabric above them would be perpendicular to what it normally is. I think t-shirt fabric is stretchy enough that it wouldn't matter that much, but the shirt might be slightly less comfortable to wear, or lie on your body differently."
sewing,3ckqj4,CitrusGymnast,6,Wed Jul 8 17:51:53 2015 UTC,"Sorry to disappoint, but no. There's not enough extra fabric, plus the darts and pockets would be in the wrong place. You might be able to take it in/re-cut it to maintain a single-breasted blazer, but even that's iffy."
sewing,3cl8bb,czerniana,0,Wed Jul 8 19:52:52 2015 UTC,I would suggest a flannel or even fleece if you want it extra soft and comfy. Flannel won't roll as much on cut edges so will be easier to sew. Good luck!!
sewing,3clka5,my_venting_account,2,Wed Jul 8 21:15:32 2015 UTC,"Congratulations on your free machine! :D  It's worth whatever someone will pay for it. That sounds flippant, but seriously, even much older machines than this are seldom bought by collectors as priceless antiques -- prices vary, but mostly around the low end, except for very rare models in a spotless condition. You can look at eBay and various classifieds to get an idea of what people buy and sell vintage machines for.  You can sew with it, assuming it works. Does the needle go up and down when you turn the wheel? If so, congratulations; there's a good chance it's in a usable state.  It uses plastic class 15 bobbins and low shank feet, which are very common and inexpensive, and normal domestic needles (15x1).  I haven't found a free manual for this exact model, but here's one for the 4006/4016, which looks very similar. You should be able to figure out things like threading from that.  Regarding upkeep: a lot of newer old sewing machines have the unfortunate flaw of having been made with nylon gears, which wear out and are often impossible to replace. In this forum thread someone suggests that this model is all-metal inside, but they seem to be guessing based on how heavy it looks, so I'd take that with a grain of salt. Look inside the machine to see if you can see any plastic. If all the moving parts are metal, it's probably worth getting the machine serviced. If there are nylon gears, maybe get some quotes and find out how replaceable they are, but beware of sinking too much money into the machine. Either way, taking it to a repair shop will tell you more about its condition and life expectancy."

sewing,3cfi6t,confluence,9,Tue Jul 7 18:33:58 2015 UTC,"Nice! This is a popular model, and it uses common needles, bobbins and feet.  And you got a zigzagger and buttonholer too -- definitely a good deal!  I have a buttonholer like that, and once you figure out how to align it to the fabric correctly it's pretty easy to use.  Two caveats:    Beware of old thread; it decays.  If you get weird tension problems or it keeps snapping, try using newer thread. Bobbins! I think I can see at least three different types of bobbins in the photos, not all of which are the right type for the machine. The slightly curved ones with four holes are class 66 (which fit some other vintage Singers). I think the taller flat ones are class 15 (the right kind) and the shorter flat ones with the same diameter are class L.  They might all be in there because they sort of work anyway, or because they were left over from completely different machines. You can try them out, but you might get weird tension issues from using the wrong bobbin type. The class 15 is the most common modern domestic bobbin type, so it should be really easy to get more. The modern metal ones sometimes are solid like these, and sometimes have holes in them. You can also get clear plastic class 15 bobbins, but it is advisable only to use metal ones in a machine which was designed to use metal ones (because the weight is different)."

If you're interested in constructive criticism, I'd suggest making the bodice shorter the next time you use the pattern.  As a rule, historically-inspired designs look best when the waist is placed at or above the true natural waist, which is several inches higher than our modern perception of the waist (for the record, this bodice pattern is from an era when dress waists were between one and two inches above the true natural waist)."

sewing,3cgjiy,tedkord4,10,Tue Jul 7 19:06:35 2015 UTC,"Interfacing stiffens the fabric so that it holds a shape or a line more crisply. It's great for necklines, collars, corsets, etc. Anything that needs to be more rigid and sturdy.   Sew in interfacing is best for fabrics that can't withstand iron heat, or fabric knitted so loosely that the interfacing glue would leak through the weave. I prefer iron on because it's less work and more errorproof, but I also don't often work with delicate fabrics.  If you're using a specific pattern that calls for interfacing, if you skip the interfacing your jacket will likely move in a way unlike the original and may look more like a ""knock off"" than a legitimate product. It's a subtle distinction, so it's up to you how accurate you want to be.  Lining doesn't add as much rigidity to a garment, and is mostly for finishing the final look - it looks much nicer and more professional to catch a glimpse of a nice lining inside a jacket than it does to see a lot of loose seams hanging about. You would use both a lining and an interfacing to create both a sturdy crisp silhouette and a nice finished interior.  Hope this helps!"

sewing,3cgjiy,Hippy_the_Hippo,3,Tue Jul 7 22:14:45 2015 UTC,"Interfacing, lining, interlining and underlining refer to construction details that are usually hidden from view when you're wearing a garment, but they serve an important function in maintaining the shape and comfort of your creation.  Interfacing is a support fabric used in areas that need more stability than just the fabric weight. For example, you’ll find interfacing in collars, cuffs, waistbands, closures (like buttonholes), and sometimes hems. In tailored garments, you may find interfacing under entire garment sections, and more than one type used within a single garment.  Lining is used to help hide the inner construction details of a garment, and also to help it slide off and on over other clothing with ease. Lining fabrics are usually slippery and silky, though other types may be used for effect. Lining is constructed separately from the garment and attached at facing or hem areas by hand or machine.  Interlining is a fabric added to a garment when more warmth is needed, like in a winter coat. It may be a heavy fabric with batting added, or a lighter weight one like flannel or fleece. Interlining can be constructed separately from the actual garment (it’s sometimes removable), or used as an underlining.  Underlining is a fabric added to fashion fabric for more body and/or opacity. It’s a separate layer attached to the corresponding garment fabric section wrong side, and then treated as one during construction. Pattern markings are often transferred to the underlining to avoid show-through on the garment fabric"
sewing,3cgjiy,whyiamiwastingmytime,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:38:46 2015 UTC,"/u/Hippy_the_Hippo describes the differences between interfacing, interlining, underlining, etc.  You can always use a sew-in interfacing, but it's a bit more effort to apply. Cheaper clothes always use fusible.  Better clothes may use fusible sparingly at certain locations, such as a zipper reinforcement."

sewing,3cf5oq,Aari_G,3,Tue Jul 7 14:45:59 2015 UTC,You can use bias binding for this pattern.  The neckline may be slightly higher since the seam allowance will be shorter with bias tape.  My wife uses single fold bias tape for facings all the time.

sewing,3cc65h,TreeEyedRaven,4,Mon Jul 6 19:41:43 2015 UTC,"Singers from this era start getting a bit sketchy, because this is when manufacturers started introducing nylon gears. But this is a 237, which is good news because it was one of the last all-metal models. You can verify this by looking inside the machine.  More good news: it uses the most common domestic bobbin type (15), the most common needle system (15x01) and one of the most common foot types (low shank).  So getting accessories for it should be easy.  I've generally heard good things about the 237. It's not a very fancy model, and some people don't like it as much as the ones with cams and a hundred different stitches, but it does straight stitch and zigzag and it'll work with a variety of special-purpose feet.  It looks like the faceplate is missing -- the machine will run without it, but the inside of the head may collect more dust. You may be able to find a replacement on eBay if someone is breaking down a machine for parts.  You can try to clean and oil the machine yourself -- if you can turn the wheel but there's resistance, it's probably just gummed up with old oil and dust. There should be no resistance when you turn the wheel -- everything should move freely. Be sure to clean out the area around the bobbin case -- it gets filthy with lint and grease, and can cause a variety of tension problems.  Sewing machine belts aren't supposed to be very tight, so yours is probably fine the way it is.  If you can't get it to work even after a very thorough cleaning, take it to a repair place for a professional service. If it's all metal, it's worth investing a bit into getting it fixed -- it should last for a long time. They should also be able to help you to source a replacement faceplate.  You can download a free manual from Singer here."

Well...Today I decided to make my first attempt at hemmimg jeans and keeping the original hem in an attempt to keep them from looking altered. I used to sew a lot and have a machine but it's been many many years and I've hemmed by hand before so figured I'd give it a go. I googled and found a tutorial that even had a link to the recommended back stitch and decided that's what I would try.  My hand is killing me but I think it went great. The bottom finished product pictures are after ironing and there is a picture showing all my lines. They aren't perfectly straight but I'm still really proud :). Now I'm just not sure if I want to cut off the extra fabric or not. I'm confident it will hold so I can't find a reason to not cut it off since it just makes the bottom bulky.

Some people think that if an outfit isn't skin-tight it makes a woman look pregnant.  Nice fabric. It does look slightly dowdy from the front (it's the pattern as derived from the block, not your sewing).  I wonder if a longer or shorter length would have been more flattering. It's hard to tell what a block manipulation will look like if you don't have a finished example.  Will you try it again in a fabric with more drape?"

The patterns made by this company come with very detailed instructions and are good for a beginner.  This one in knit is nice because it comes with quite a few different modifications if you want short or long sleeve or to add some style details.  Also, knit stuff is always super comfy!  And the bottom is swirly and flouncy and good for dancing.    This pattern is probably one of my favorites to make.  Since it's a wrap around dress that ties the fit is always great.  You can also use a different fabric for the tie that contrasts with the dress or the same fabric as the dress if you want it to blend in.

I also had a set that I altered to make panniers but didn't have too many dresses that worked with them.  It's really what got me into sewing.

There are hundreds of fascinating patent applications for new and novel butt pillows -- some of them really make me giggle.  In this case, a but pillow is just engineering.  You wouldn't' see it under the hoop of course, but when you are going to put about twice as much fabric on your rear than your front, it sometimes takes a little help to keep the hoops from wanting to pitch up in the front and drag in the back.  Some elliptical hoops have little lacing panels in the back to transfer the pressure to your bum. This one has the tapes that wrap over your hips, which has a similar effect.  But if you are slim or sway-backed you might find that a little half circle pillow tucked right under the back will keep the waistband from slipping down in the back and transfer the weight of your skirts to your body in a more comfortable way. Its an easy thing to do, and easy to adjust and play around with as your petticoats and skirts get heavier or lighter."

A pair of wire cutters makes short work of it, it's nice and light, and doesn't have the round bulk of plastic tubes. The Vena Cava Designs kit had all the materials, hooping included, was very reasonably priced compared to purchasing boning alone (and you just get exactly how much you need with enough extra in case of an oops) so unless you're trying to make them in a shoestring budget I would highly recommend doing the real thing."

Using the presser foot as a guide against the edge, sew one line.  Then, using the presser foot as a guide against the sewn line, sew a series of straight lines. Draw a long arc and sew it.  Using the presser foot as a guide, sew a series of arcs the width of a presser foot. Sew a maze, starting at the edges of the square and sewing in one presser foot width when you reach the end of square."

I try to restrict my purchase of patterns because there's a limited number of shapes I like and clothing can be adapted from basic patterns I've already fit.  Plus, you never really know what a pattern is going to look like until you fit and sew it, which is time-consuming. I try to buy only patterns that I can imagine I'd want to wear a lot in order to compensate for the time and expense in tracing, fitting, and making them.  Not everything will work out, but I tend to stay away from one-off experiments. Before buying, I check out patterns on Sewing Pattern Review before buying and Google them. When possible, I buy muslin in bulk and other supplies like pattern paper and oaktag in large rolls. I like Swedish Tracing Paper, but am going to try soil separator paper as a cheaper alternative. I buy Groupons for discount fabric stores like Paron Fabrics in New York. I buy a lot of supplies from Amazon.com when it's cheaper. I bought a used professional dress from on craigslist. I use Japanese pattern books, which come with pattern pages from which you trace off patterns.

sewing,3c0hot,molecool,3,Fri Jul 3 17:27:15 2015 UTC,"1/4"" seams are pretty standard for most quilters, so no worries there. And I say this as someone who's hand- and machine-pieced quilts using that seam allowance.  Ironing/pressing is very much a personal choice, and can be influenced by your project. For instance, for larger projects, I might 'nest' my seams. This means that I would iron the seam allowances in opposite directions. For smaller projects, I usually opt to iron my seams open, to create a cleaner finish.   Basically, go with what works best for you, and your sewing machine. Some machines just don't like a lot of layers to go through. Others are okay with it  If you are looking to re-use the older quilt, you would probably be better served to simply cover up the front, rather than try to remove the older, worn top. Your batting might not handle being recycled without something to stabilize it, depending on just what the batting was made of it."

Your project will go easier if you remember a few things.  First and very important:  Press and square your blocks as you go!  I promise this will make your blocks come together sew much more easily & everything will lay flatter when it's pieced together.  I have found some truly excellent rulers that make this soooo much easier. Your seam allowance is fine (I use 1/4"" on every project I've ever done). More important than the actual measure of it is to be consistent! You can press your seams open or to either side you choose.  Usually if I'm pressing to the side I press toward the darker fabric.  Also, when you are pressing a good thing to remember is not to pull the fabric (you aren't ironing like you would with clothes)  You don't want to put extra pressure on your seams either. As for re-using the batting and backing from your old quilt... If it was me, I'd use new just because I'm too lazy to de-construct the old one (plus old quilts tend to stretch with use and washing.  This could make the old/new fabrics behave differently when washed)   I hope this helps!"

But if you're into refashioning and costumes definitely check out thrift stores around town. I like antique mall of America or antiques at the market for unique finds to refashion or dresses with enough material to reuse for other projects. You do have to hunt a bit to find the good stuff. Sadly you won't find a ton of vintage fabrics in town.
sewing,3by28x,lemonbee,2,Fri Jul 3 03:28:44 2015 UTC,"I'll check those out, thank you! The fabrics don't have to be vintage, just fun and exciting, or at least lots of styles to choose from. I'm surprised to hear there aren't any crazy fabric warehouses there, given the number of performances and shows happening all the time."

We do have a ton of costuming warehouses though, and I know some of my director friends get stuff there for their shows.

sewing,3bval3,mouthpipettor,10,Thu Jul 2 16:28:51 2015 UTC,"One of my favorite fabric and fiber stores is Fancy Tiger Crafts out of Denver. Their success is largely because they sell lots of different types of fabric, for quilting and for garment construction, along with notions, a huge selection of books and all sorts of yarn and spinning stuff.  While the store it's self isn't very big, all of their stuff definitely feels curated for the store. It's not a random selection of stuff; it's all been very carefully chosen for their aesthetic and their customers.   They also go out of their way to have community events and classes. They have an open sew day once a month and do other sorts of community-related activities.  The other key factor in their success? They have a massive and active online presence, including a web store."

sewing,3bval3,whyiamiwastingmytime,3,Thu Jul 2 16:25:52 2015 UTC,"I believe the open sew is done during after work hours (6:30 or so) and they have an open space with chairs and a table. Basically, there's chatting and working on craft projects. I think the store is open but I'm not sure."

sewing,3bval3,thesnowfox,3,Thu Jul 2 20:25:53 2015 UTC,"Bottom line it's hard to compete with places like Walmart and JoAnn's. The markup for small shops is more and even some craft and sewing shops that used to compete with them couldn't make it. Sewing has become a hobby, one that you really need to be making some decent money to be able to afford. Thread is very expensive in particular. I inherited a huge lot of material from a neighbor that quit sewing after man years otherwise I would not be sewing nearly as much. I can barely afford decent thread, seriously."
sewing,3bval3,grumpi2,8,Thu Jul 2 13:41:47 2015 UTC,"The only thing I'd say about Walmart and Joanns is it's crap fabric. You get what you pay for. If you care about the outcome of your apparel, you'll seek out the shops that carry decent fabric. It's hard to compete against the 40% coupons though."
sewing,3bval3,grumpi2,6,Thu Jul 2 14:36:54 2015 UTC,"My experience with both is that they carry cheap to middle of the road fabric that is affordable. Problem with buying ""better"" fabric is that it is often not affordable for me. I used to live in San Francisco and I used to shop at several fabric shops including Britex which is about the best place I have ever seen for sewing supplies and getting great fabrics outside the stores in the garment district in NYC. I loved Britex but the prices in that place they nearly beggared me.   I like really great fabric but reality is reality and that means shopping at JoAnn's and Walmart a lot. Where I live now outside of those two stores there is only one fabric store. It's local and because I want it to survive I do make a point of shopping there, but honestly the reason they don't have as much business as they probably like is the high prices. I go there for decent thread and it's a minimum of $4 for a thread spool that won't do much more than fill up a bobbin. I have to buy at least 2 or 3 for every project. That's $12 right there. Fabric? It starts at $5 for cheap cottons, but most of what I'd like to use is approaching $15-20 a yard. If I try to make a midi dress I'm probably spending $45-75 on supplies. Prices like that it definitely makes sewing my own clothes an ""optional"" hobby these days.   When I was a kid my aunt and my Mom both sewed a fair bit. It was not a hobby it was a necessity. Making curtains, pillows, clothes and other items was far cheaper than buying them retail. Now I can get all that new and it's nearly always less expensive to do so than to sew myself. Doing needlework has become a hobby for the upwardly mobile. I used to crochet all the time, with good yarn. I used to embroider all the time with good floss. I'd spend $20 maybe on a bigger project. Now? I'm looking at $65-100 for the same thing. It's crazy. This is what keeps me out of the good fabric stores as much as I'd like to only shop there. Inflation has caused what used to be a very affordable and enjoyable thing for me to do right out of my budget range.   Like I said in the other post I got lucky a while back with fabric. A neighbor who's glaucoma was getting so bad she couldn't sew anymore gave me almost an entire sewing room full of fabric. I actually ended up giving some away to the ladies in a sewing club here in my park because there was so much I literally could not store it. I'm pretty well set for fabric for a good long while but what she didn't supply me with was the thread I'd need to use it. I have to buy that myself and even at JoAnn's it's pretty darned expensive unless you want thread that's going to break on you all the time. Walmart here discontinued their crafts section for a while. The outcry was so big that this year they not only reinstated it but they made it bigger. A lot of people really depend upon it because they can't afford the local JoAnn's or the one better sewing supplies store that we do have.   All the ladies I know who sew we all love the better store. But reality is we can't afford to support them all the time and they know it too. They make up a lot of the income they need not by selling fabric but by offering classes and selling and servicing machines. I seriously doubt that they'd even exist here save for that. I'm not down on good fabrics or the stores that sell them, but I am saying a reality check is necessary here, particularly for someone opening up a new one. If the area is more affluent it might work, but if like here 90% of the people needing supplies are like me and my friends higher end fabrics and supplies just won't bring people in enough for a store like that to survive. It's not a question of ""like"" it's a question of ""budget"" and it's a major factor in how well a sewing store does. You have to know your area and your target market and cater to it. People who can't afford to sew otherwise won't simply stop buying at Walmart just because someone is offering them something better and if most of the people in your area are like that? You've got a problem trying to open a higher quality store.  There's a higher end yarn store here for people who knit, crochet and that. We all love that store too, but from day one they've been struggling to keep their doors open. Our Micheal's and JoAnn's they do carry some better yarn. It's not cheap there either but still it's marked up a fair bit more at the little store than at those stores. So guess where most people here get their yarn when they're buying it the regular way? Honestly, now more and more of us now use the internet with it's broad selection of fabrics because even with shipping it can cost us half of what it does at the local stores, even Walmart etc. I hate to do that, not support the the local store but sometimes using the internet means actually being able to do a few projects vs being able to do maybe one and for me that's major reason to shop that way.   When I can get very good thread, and I can, on places like Amazon for half why would I shop at my local stores except as a way to intentionally support them? I can't always afford to be that generous. Sewing and other needlework supplies offline have gotten too expensive for me to be able to afford them most of the time and I do still like to sew etc. It's a hard choice and sometimes I really hate making it, particularly when I see how my local stores, not the big box stores, are struggling, but the reality of it is I just can't afford to do it a whole lot, shop offline. Sad, but true..."
sewing,3bval3,grumpi2,2,Thu Jul 2 23:28:10 2015 UTC,"Sad, but true...   Sad, but very true.  That's why customer service and things like fitting clinics are so important.  They aren't available online and bring people into the store."
sewing,3bval3,grumpi2,2,Fri Jul 3 00:28:33 2015 UTC,"Err, thanks for the wall of text saying you can't afford the good stuff? I started off buying from Walmart and Joann's too, but then I realized that the fabric (being as crappy as it is) is frustrating to work with. I would rather save up for decent fabric for a nice work outfit than to use something that will only last a couple of washes before fading, shredding, or pilling up.  I could spend hours on a dress and only get to wear it a couple of times, or I could spend hours on a dress using decent fabric and have a garment that will last a lifetime. There are trade-offs.   If I'm making little things for my kids, I certainly go to Joann's, because they'll outgrow it anyway! But my work clothes? Hell to the naw. I'm going to a nicer store to get apparel fabric that doesn't suck a nut."

sewing,3bval3,KitchenStitch,6,Fri Jul 3 00:24:03 2015 UTC,"The most important things are probably    to make being in your store enjoyable for the people you want to cater to. I think there's a lot of ways to be creative here and try out things. to make sure you cater to a large enough group of people to find out what the people you can reach have trouble finding at your competitors' stores to never apologize for the price at which you have to offer things. You are not only selling materials. You'll want to do your best to make people happy about what they bought. The relationships matter. Tell people confidently that it's correct that something costs a little less at the chain store but that the chain store won't be able to give the kind of support and community feeling. If you're doing something charitable, like teaching sewing to poor kids for free or something like that, display this in your store so people see that they're supporting someone who is kind and generous. Lead by example so that the people who walk into your store become more generous people themselves and recognize how much additional value can be found in stores like yours. Be kind and accepting to those who don't realize or feel that way. They might tell their friends ""this fabric store I checked out recently had so great fabrics! But they are too expensive. The people working there are really nice, though"". That friend might just hear ""great fabrics and nice people"" because they're not that tight on cash. to become really really savy at wholesale fabric shopping. You can make people very happy by finding fabrics that speak to them."

sewing,3bval3,KitchenStitch,3,Fri Jul 3 11:35:59 2015 UTC,"From what I've read and seen it's really #4 that many fabric store owners struggle with.  Some feel bad about the prices they make, some feel they're doing so much that people must appreciate, resulting in them coming across as feeling entitled. If you can avoid it, you should never let people feel you're feeling entitled to them becoming your customers because they entered the store. :)  Yes, it will happen that customers treat you badly. The best thing you can do is assume total ignorance on their part and not get annoyed.  It's really about making peace with your own potentially conflicting thoughts and the fact that you won't be able to convert everyone. Which is totally okay.  I hear that there are customers who pinch every penny and others who will simply buy what makes them happy / what saves them time.  I see some online shops selling fabric/notions/patterns in sets, e.g. for a bra + panties. Or for a swimsuit. This is a thing that could appeal to beginners, as long as you can get them into your store. Selecting all the different parts that go into a bra or a swimsuit can be quite difficult even for the more experienced home sewers. Humans suffer from analysis paralysis (too many choices overwhelm) and some people need a push to bring their sewing to the next level or to try something new. There is value in helping people make a decision they will later feel good about (e.g. ""I got this set from her and it all worked out so great, I'd never have managed to find/select all these pieces in a way that they match so beautifully""). Another point of value associated with these sets is that there won't be lots of leftovers like when you buy from the bolt. I always feel bad about all the waste. I won't mind paying the full price. Knowing that the piece of fabric I didn't need will help the kind and helpful person you are pay their rent will be enough. I have no clue if this selling-bra/swimwear-sets concept could work your area or in general. Only way you'll find out is by observing and studying your customers, or just giving it a try.  Regarding #5: There is a group of people who does love to get involved. Some people would happily meet with you for a fabric party where you let them help you make decisions. Maybe you have only single spot a certain time of the year and the lucky winner does get a behind-the-scenes look plus the ability to pick 1-2 fabrics they love at a discount. Just an idea, not sure how well it would work. The difficult part is probably finding the best wholesalers, acquiring a giant heap of samples. But when you're struggling to make a selection, your community has people who would like to help you. Be a person who is helpful and helpful people will feel attracted to you.  The thing you personally need to figure out is what are things that are easy to do for you but that could help others. No point in doing things that are very hard to do for you when there's easier things where you can make a difference.  E.g. some people feel refreshed and invigorated when having a lot of friends and contact to others. For someone like that, having the store be a social meeting point is great. If you're more like an introvert and lots of contact to others feels draining, you may not want to be a bustling meeting point. Just as an example. Try to go with your personality and strengths. There's countless things you can do and try out.  Sorry for writing so much. I feel that starting a fabric store is not for the faint of heart and that it's very good you are asking so openly. Anything you do that can help you understand the needs of your specific community will help you to figure out how to meet these needs in a way that is profitable."

If you can avoid it, you should never let people feel you're feeling entitled to them becoming your customers because they entered the store. :)   There are two yarn stores in my town, and I only shop at one of them now for this reason.  The owner of the yarn store I no longer shop at had that entitled attitude and every time I went in there she's always bitching about her financial troubles and it made me feel really uncomfortable, like as if I'm not allowed to just browse or I'm a bad person, like I HAD to buy something or get out.

sewing,3bval3,KitchenStitch,3,Fri Jul 3 13:23:00 2015 UTC,"It's great you have personally witnessed how the entitlement issue manifests. Just being aware of this single thing and actively trying to be modest yet confident regarding your offerings, I feel, increases your chance of success tremendously.  Obviously, it is very very hard for the yarn store owner to be laid back and confident when she has financial troubles. The solution is never whining, it's always changing something in the business. When you notice yourself starting to feel the need to whine, get help fast, talk to a good friend or to people who can advise you. The earlier you do something, the more you can save when things start going rough.  ETA: I don't want to say that things will get rough. Just that starting a business is an experiment with an unknown outcome. What you can do is be prepared and informed to increase your chances of succeeding as much as you can. It could as well turn out that you're hitting a nerve and people love your store right away. :D"

sewing,3bval3,makesan,3,Fri Jul 3 16:17:02 2015 UTC,"I don't know anything about businesses but here are a few things I've noticed that successful fabric stores have in common:   they're near a busy center of a city (the ones in suburbs tend to close up shop pretty quickly, and a higher rent might be worth the trade off of added foot traffic) they offer a TON of classes (I think it's because then people have to buy things for the classes and once people are taught techniques, they're more comfortable sewing and so they keep doing it! Plus I've noticed people really love signing up their kids to sewing camps over the summer.) Successful shops tend to have a little bit of everything. I've been in shops that offer only quilting cottons and those always bore me and I end up writing them off. I like a mix of modern quilting cottons, apparel fabrics, knit fabrics, and an embroidery section.   Also, when you expand and hire, please consider personality during your hiring process! I love it when I go into the shop and I can tell the workers there are passionate about their craft and they're willing to help newbies with questions.   Oh! And a social media presence is always something that keeps a shop on my radar. I sometimes get busy but I always check Facebook and when I see a shop is posting pictures of new inventory, it makes me yearn to start another project again."

I love it when I go into the shop and I can tell the workers there are passionate about their craft and they're willing to help newbies with questions.   This is definitely something I'll be looking for!  Honestly though I'm really nervous about hiring.  I hear that everyone is at first, but, still, brings my heart rate up."
sewing,3bval3,makesan,4,Fri Jul 3 11:41:12 2015 UTC,"Don't rush the hiring. Let them talk - you'll probably want someone talkative and open, so get them to talk about their sewing during the interview. They may feel less nervous when they can talk about something they love and you will get an idea how they talk to people they just met. If they can't talk about sewing with at least a bit of enthusiasm, don't hire.  Pay attention to your gut feeling. If there's any doubt, don't hire."
sewing,3bval3,whyiamiwastingmytime,4,Fri Jul 3 13:23:02 2015 UTC,"I also live in NYC and frequent the garment district, but that's a completely different market than what you're talking about.  I agree with what others say about competitive pricing, at least a small stock of notions (I hate having to make multiple stops for one garment, especially if they're not close), and stocking a variety of quality apparel fabrics. Another recommendation I'd give is to find a good source of quality knits. They're becoming much more popular in the sewing community as more and more home sewers buy sergers, and want to sew all their own clothes instead of just special occasion dresses.  Also, the community connection is so important. If you have the space and budget, set up a sewing workspace with a few sewing machines and a large cutting table.  Offer classes in a range of time frames and price levels- a short, inexpensive class on sewing a zipper, and a weekend-long intensive for those who want to sew their first dress.  You might be able to get a company like Simplicity or Brother to sponsor your workspace by providing you with machines in exchange for publicity.  I recently took a class at Workroom Social in Brooklyn and she's got a great thing going there.  Find and reach out to local sewing bloggers and try to partner with them. Start your own blog and offer the bloggers a small allowance at your store in exchange for sewing one garment a month with your fabric (I'd do it in a heartbeat!) When you've set up an online presence and store, you can reach out to some of the bigger names with a national following to try and get more publicity.  Word-of-mouth is huge in the online sewing community.  Stock the independent sewing company's patterns. They're very popular right now and will increase your image as a quality independent sewing shop. Sewaholic, Colette, Closet Case Files, Megan Nielsen, Grainline, Victory to name just a few of those companies.  Keep us posted on how the store opening goes! Are you willing to share where you're located?"

They're very popular right now and will increase your image as a quality independent sewing shop. Sewaholic, Colette, Closet Case Files, Megan Nielsen, Grainline, Victory to name just a few of those companies.   Great minds think alike ;)  First thing I thought of stocking when I first put out there I wanted to do this, was indie patterns!  Also agree on the monthly garment discount; like if they are reviewing a product I carry or if they're making a display for my store, they'd get a discount.  I haven't worked out the finer points.  Maybe a contest once in a while?  I'm in Canada, quite a ways from NYC.  One day I'd love to get there to visit the massive fabric stores I keep hearing so much about!!  Haha"
sewing,3bval3,whyiamiwastingmytime,3,Thu Jul 2 20:02:25 2015 UTC,"Look into Lekala, which customizes patterns  are very inexpensive: under $3.  The indie companies often sell simple patterns that are overpriced in my opinion.  If people like the Lekala versions, buy a plotter (a printer) and charge a reasonable fee to print them out full-size.  Customers will create their own online accounts with Lekala and order the pattern, which is emailed."
sewing,3bval3,whyiamiwastingmytime,3,Fri Jul 3 00:22:08 2015 UTC,"I agree that the indie patterns are on the expensive side, but I see it as an investment in the community. I love that when I buy a Sewaholic pattern I can go online and see tutorials, and sewalongs, and other people's projects for inspiration. You can also usually email the designers if you have an issue. I consider it to be an investment in the support, and I like that I'm supporting sewers like me.  I do really ration the patterns I buy because of the cost, though.  I've never heard of Lekala. I'm going to have to look into it."
sewing,3bval3,whyiamiwastingmytime,2,Fri Jul 3 16:23:02 2015 UTC,"Based on what I've seen, I think Mood (the biggest fabric store here) has a handful of sewing bloggers as part of their Mood Sewing Network. Those bloggers get an allowance of, say, $50 of fabric once a month in exchange for making something and posting on their own blogs about the store. Then Mood can also post about the projects on their own blog, showing what their fabric is used for.  You get publicity and blog content, for what is probably a very reasonable rate, and the sewing bloggers get to subsidize their hobby.  Also, I bet the bloggers would buy more fabric than their allowance, and the readers might also buy the same fabric they see in the post.  And you should definitely come to NYC. It's not that the stores are that massive; in fact, many of them are quite small. It's just that there are a huge number of apparel-focused stores in a very small area- just a couple of square blocks.  I'd say you could stay with me if we weren't moving out of the city soon."
sewing,3bval3,dressup,3,Thu Jul 2 21:10:26 2015 UTC,"I've wondered how much the Mood allowance is; it's never been disclosed. I have mixed feelings about the sewing network. At times, I feel that Mood is using the sewers (it edits their posts and requires variety in projects) and the participants sometimes give off a cliquey vibe. And make no mistake, one garment a month can be burdensome."
sewing,3bval3,mistrosemary,3,Fri Jul 3 00:25:34 2015 UTC,"Given the cost of Mood fabric and the amounts I've seen some of the bloggers buy (I follow Lladybird), I'd guess that the allowance is probably around $100 a month, if not more. I can understand your wariness about the deal, but if you look at the bloggers involved, they blog multiple projects every week.  I imagine doing one project a month is probably very manageable for them. For the average sewer, of course, this is much more difficult.  Honestly, I have no idea how they afford to sew as much as they do. I'd go bankrupt. I'm mostly just jealous that they've found a way to subsidize their hobby."
sewing,3bwxro,Beautiful_Sound,2,Thu Jul 2 20:50:16 2015 UTC,/r/quilting probably has some good answers to this as well. :)
sewing,3bwxro,wanderedoff,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:07:35 2015 UTC,"I tried this once and it turned out okay, but I prefer hand quilting for the therapy of it.  I didn't use a walking foot.  I hear/read they are nice, but I prefer the handwork and the look of the handwork, so didn't invest.  I would try out a small project or just a trial square maybe, first, to see if you like the process on the machine.    I suggest that you use your cabinet machine, but pull it away from the wall or angle it and stack some of those big plastic storage boxes or put a small table behind it to hold the bulk; this will help the bulk to not pull on the stitches.  Also, if your cabinet doesn't have enough table space to the left of the needle, you can stack some boxes or place a table or something near in height, for the same purpose.    Be very careful of your light, if your machine is an old one, so it doesn't burn the rolled up bulky part.    Definitely adjust the pressure foot.   Bike clips, that are meant to go around your pants legs are good for keeping the bulky part rolled up for later and out of your way."
sewing,3bwxro,blueberryyogurtcup,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:28:29 2015 UTC,If you are sewing on a 201/66 you probably need to adjust/reduce the pressure foot. I don't think a walking foot is entirely necessary but it's helpful.  I've only done straight stitch quilting on a 201. If you are trying to free motion and you have never free motioned before that's a whole different thing. I personally have zero success with it on any machine.  Good luck!
sewing,3bwxro,MissingHeiress,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:23:44 2015 UTC,I have both a walking foot and a free motion/darning foot. Walking foot is fantastic. Does straight lines beautifully with very little to no puckering. They can be expensive depending on what type of machine you have tho. Free motion foot is cheaper but takes awhile to get the hang of...especially if you're low on throat space. Cabinet machine should actually be better than the portable one because its flush with the table. If you don't want to  get a special foot i recommend using basting spray ( i use it for my bigger projects otherwise the bent safety pins work great). Make sure you get the basting spray for machine quilting so it doesnt gum up your needle. You can get it at pretty much any craft or fabric store. Good Luck :) And like /u/wanderedoff said /r/quilting is super helpful with anything quilting related

If you ask for that, emphasise that you do not want topstitching visible on the outside of the dress (just in case you get a seamstress who likes to cut corners).  Or get it rigilened, the dress in the picture has rigilene at least.  Looks to me like there is a knee-ish length layer (actually, two layers, ending at different levels) of stiff net at the waist, fully enclosed between the outer and lining.  And specify that you want the skirt lining closed at the hem, not just shanked, or loose.  Look for a relatively stiff 'crinkly' silk (not paper stiff - you'll know it when you feel it) and don't make the lining fabric too lightweight, or you'll see through it.  Vietnam should be easy to track down some decent silks, though perhaps not patterned, it's a good country for sourcing fabrics.  Really beautiful dress, I'd love to see the end result."

In the UK it is sold exclusively by a big department store called John Lewis as an own brand product, but they have some kinda contract with Janome and thats who makes the machine. Its 28x23x12.5cm and only weighs 2.5kg compared to my 525s which is 42x28x17cm and 7kg. It has a drop in bobbin and fits low shank feet, but the screw on ones, I suppose you could get a snapon adapter? It has a straight stitch and some pre-determined zigzags, reverse. Being smaller, its obviously not as powerful as a normal sized machine, but I highly doubt its less powerful than the machines you listed. The pedal control is just on or off, but the machine is slow enough for that not to be an issue, nothing is going to run away, haha. Its £50 in the UK . Maybe of some help. I've considered getting one before as a portable machine myself. But I've found its just as easy to put my 525s in the car.   Edit: Found a review and it turns out its sold in the US under a few names Janome Portable, Janome Sew Mini and Janome Sew Mini 124 All ~$60-70. The reviews on Amazon fair far better than the other machines.  Another edit: That reviewer even made a carry bag/case for it. The machine is just adorable! I want one.

sewing,3bsddw,tall_chap,2,Wed Jul 1 19:31:19 2015 UTC,I thought you meant a decorative pillow. A feather pillow is a highly specialized project and there must be 100s of places that sell them in all kinds of sizes. There may be places that will copy a pillow for you.  I think this would be way too much work and expense for the yield. I don't know where you can buy feathers and there may be regulations relating to its purchase and treatment for pillows.

However, the piping along the corners is too thick for my machine to handle - it won't even fit under the foot to be able to sew it. Is there a way to thin the bulk or will I just have to hand sew the corners? Or is there a better way to make the purse?   I constructed the entire zipper panel first then one by one I added each panel to it (sides, front and back). Now I'm not sure how to put the lining in. Should I have constructed the zipper panel first, then constructed the entire purse, add the lining, then put it all together?   Sorry! So many questions but I've been agonizing over this for a few days and it's making me crazy. I'm getting paid for doing this and want to make sure it doesn't look like shit.   I should note that this particular purse I posted is just a mock-up so I know what to change and where I went wrong. Her purse is still uncut."

sewing,3bn76r,patentspatented,51,Tue Jun 30 15:57:39 2015 UTC,"I'd put a slit in the back with a facing and add a hook and eye or button and loop to keep it closed. This is the basic process, though with the thickness of neckband I would have the stitch lines further apart than this tutorial shows. You could also do it as a small keyhole instead of a straight slit."
sewing,3bn76r,jfedoga,12,Tue Jun 30 16:32:07 2015 UTC,"I love the keyhole idea! It would give me even more room for her head without having to make a giant slit halfway down the bodice.  It has been many years since I've sewed anything more than just a ripped seam, so I hope you don't mind a couple of follow-up questions. Do you think it would be feasible to just get some iron-on interfacing and use that as backing for the keyhole cut? Then I could just use fray stopper on the edges and only have to actually stitch the elastic neckband.   I'm trying to find the easy way out, is what I'm really getting at here :)"
sewing,3bn76r,jfedoga,6,Tue Jun 30 17:03:25 2015 UTC,"If you apply regular (non-stretchy) fusible interfacing to the hole, it will peel off when the fabric stretches. The fabric won't fray so you don't need to worry about applying fray check, but you will want to have some sort of stitching around the hole. If you don't mind the unfinished look and it doesn't need to stand up to wear or washing, you could apply interfacing to the inside and run a line or two of stitching around the hole. If you do it this way, you'd want to straight stitch on the neckband either side of where you're going to make the cut, and it's probably easier to apply the fusible interfacing first, sew, and then cut out the hole. You could also use ribbon to close the neck with a bow, which would cover the raw ends on the neckband without having to turn them under."
sewing,3bn76r,Touchwood,5,Tue Jun 30 18:16:56 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much, this is brilliant! I think I'll buy both hooks and eyes as well as white ribbon (since there's already a white ribbon accent on the front so it would match) and see what looks like it would work the best. I doubt this whole project will take me more than maybe an hour, which is perfect. Cute dress + no screaming toddler = happy mama :)"
sewing,3bn76r,lilygrass,3,Tue Jun 30 19:25:46 2015 UTC,"And an itchy toddler, interfacing against the skin will be quite uncomfortable. Consider using a bias strip to edge the cut instead."
sewing,3bn76r,ived_nella,35,Wed Jul 1 05:10:26 2015 UTC,"I really like the keyhole idea, but just an alternative, in case for some reason it makes more sense: cut open one of the shoulders and add a couple of buttons. It looks like the right shoulder might sit a little high on her, which is what made me think of this. If that's true, this would help tailor it a little, too."
sewing,3bn76r,lilygrass,10,Tue Jun 30 17:47:49 2015 UTC,That's what I was thinking too. It would be simpler than a keyhole and a pretty cute accent as well .^
sewing,3bn76r,SearchingForMe,3,Tue Jun 30 19:56:20 2015 UTC,"I like this idea as well, but I worry that it would be difficult to finish the edges if I open the shoulder seam, since the elastic is so thick so I can't just fold it over and stitch it -- my machine doesn't have the horsepower! Hmmm. I will take a closer look at the dress again when I get home and see if I could figure something out. Because I agree, buttons on the shoulder could look seriously adorable. Little butterfly or flower buttons, ahh, somebody needs to stop me!"
sewing,3bn76r,SearchingForMe,3,Tue Jun 30 21:13:26 2015 UTC,"Hmm. If you decide to try this, maybe before cutting, sew a line a half an inch or so to either side of where the cut will be, and then trim the elastic (inside the casing) as close to the line as possible. This would hold the elastic in its place in case it wants to collapse down to the other side of the collar, as well as allow you to make it much thinner for finishing the edges."
sewing,3bn76r,newhappyrainbow,3,Tue Jun 30 21:32:16 2015 UTC,"Or better than buttons just split the seam, make a straight stitch across each side of the split and then sew in little metal snaps like these. nothing will show and they ought to be sturdy enough to hold up."

sewing,3bn76r,fulanitadetal,11,Wed Jul 1 00:09:48 2015 UTC,"So I bought this tutu dress for my daughter to wear for some family pictures in a couple of weeks. I tried it on her the other day, and the neck hole was very tight so I basically had to do WWE moves on her as I shoved her head through the hole. By the time the dress was on, she was furious and crying. Not exactly the ideal mood for taking pictures.  I'd like to somehow modify the neck hole so that it's easier to put on her, but it's not obvious to me what the best strategy would be. The neck hole itself is a solid, thick piece of elastic and the only seams are on top of the shoulders where the lace part ends. I don't expect her back to be showing in any of the pictures, so I'm open to basically chopping a seam into the back and somehow sealing it up with fray stopper and hook and eye closures, but I'm worried that will look REALLY bad since the bodice itself includes a lot of spandex so it will probably try to pull apart wherever I cut it.  Any ideas are welcome!"
sewing,3bozc2,clarityofdesire,9,Tue Jun 30 23:44:02 2015 UTC,"I usually trace out the first draft from the clothing with something flimsier and less expensive--usually random paper I have lying around. This way, if I need to make obvious alterations to the pattern (true up an edge, etc.), I can do it before I get a sturdier pattern (wastes less good paper). This may not be necessary for you depending on 1) how old the garment is that you are making a pattern from, 2) how many times you have worn the garment, 3) how much stretch/give the fabric has, and 4) how good you are at getting the initial traced pattern true to grain.   Older garments, garments that have been worn a lot, and fabrics that give and stretch may have been stretched out of the shape that they originally were when they were cut from a pattern themselves. For example, a pattern piece drafted off the front of a pair of jeans might be crooked at the knee due to the cotton stretching over the knee with wear. Therefore, after tracing off this pattern, it must be ""trued up"" such that it the new pattern piece is straight, matching the grain of the new denim you plan to use to make the duplicate jeans.   Also consider that your favorite old shirt/pants may have stretched significantly with wear or may stretch after wearing versus just out of the wash. For example, again with jeans, if you draft a pattern off an old pair of jeans and cut the new jeans out of new, unworn denim, it may stretch more than you think (the old denim has stretched almost to the max, but the new denim still has room to stretch). In a similar manner, pay attention to fiber content (is there spandex, elastine, etc. in the new fabric that isn't in the old), which can make your newly sewn replicate fit differently than the original. If your jeans fit way too tight out of the wash, but feel better after a week of wear, remember to cut your new pattern off the stretched-out size (but take account for stretching: see above).   Many of these points could be brought up with just regular sewing, but I find with patterns drafted off favorite clothing, people are less tolerant of having to make a toile first. (""The original fit, so why doesn't the new!"") Just be patient, and keep in mind that you may need to alter your pattern."

Blue butterfly seersucker - a cute adorable dress for my granddaughter for next summer. 3.  Flowered fabric -  has a nice drape.. thinking a nice dress top for work.  Not sure what pattern though. 4.  Embroidered Fabric - love love love this.  Thinking a full skirt.  Maybe a sun dress, but I don't think I have enough fabric.  It's about 2.5 yards if I recall.

sewing,3bkj7b,cuddlewench,8,Tue Jun 30 04:48:32 2015 UTC,Here's a good tutorial on it. Basically it's where you stitch the seam allowance to a facing or lining which helps to stop the facing/lining from rolling out and being visible from the outside. Also helps the neckline (or whatever you're sewing) lay nice and flat.  It's one of those things that makes a big difference in how professional a home-made garment looks

The button press is only one expense: the dies are extra, and you need a set of dies for each size of button you want to make. Button fronts and backs are usually sold in bulk, so you'll end up with a LOT of them.  If you still want a press, Osborne is a good brand. It's the one I have, and I like it a lot.

It'd be awesome to have a button press, especially if I'm making them for other people.  EDIT: My main source of income is advertising and marketing, and I always think about what my time is worth. Thinking about the amount of time and effort it takes to make buttons now (especially since about 1 out of 3 will fail), I definitely think a hand press is a worthwhile investment."

Men's slim-fit dress shirts have long used darts and really don't look like women's shirts, for example. I think this is a far better look than ending up with a weird wad of fabric at the underarm."
sewing,3bnroi,JBJeeves,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:43:31 2015 UTC,"Sorry about the link (it still works for me, but of course it would!). I've thrown the image onto Imgur. My ex, who was quite slim, used to purchase shirts with darts in the back, back in the late 80s/early 90s. Can't remember whether they were darted in the front. The exemplar garment has front darts, but I readily admit that I don't look for slim-fit shirts anymore, since my spouse is not slim, so I don't know how common that is these days.  My problem with virtually all of the shirt's I've seen only taken in at the sides is the big tuck of fabric at the underarm/sleeve, which is, I think, worse than just leaving the shirt unaltered in the first place.  Of course, in a perfect world, shirts would actually fit, instead of having to contemplate taking off the sleeves to correct this kind of issue.   I noticed when I was browsing through webshop where I found the shirt in the first place that a staggering number of the men's button-downs have princess seams. Is that something new? I'm not sure I like it. They're virtually all also much too tight and I know I don't like that."

sewing,3bjysq,LadyFoxbriar,2,Mon Jun 29 21:00:23 2015 UTC,"I’ll be honest and say this is my first real project that I am doing on my own. I have gotten about a third of the way through making this women’s top and I’m getting stuck at step 10 (I will say steps 7-9 have been fuzzy to me) – see the linked photos.   I took a picture of the pattern, but can someone please explain to me in detail what step 10 is trying to have me do? The pattern defined “understitch” as “Press facing away from garment; press seam towards facing. Face side up, understitch close to the seam through facing and seam allowances.” This might as well be in another language. Words like “facing” and “press” take on odd meanings in sewing. Can someone ELI5?  Also feel free to check over my work for steps 7-9. I think I did it right, but again the instructions are vague. I know the elastic cord is hard to see because it’s black, but it’s there. It just seems odd that they have it facing opposite the way I think it would, but I’m guessing this is because I will fold the edge over? The term “layer” was also weirdly defined as “trim seam allowance in layers.” I guess making sure they’re not the same length? I didn’t see why the pattern needed to say this because it looked pretty layered to me as is unless I did it wrong.  Thanks in advance if you can help. I would love to have this done to show my mom (who use to sew a lot) this weekend. I want to make her proud!"
sewing,3bjysq,deM0de,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:00:47 2015 UTC,"Pressing basically means ironing the seams flat. The difference with pressing is it's supposed to be more of an up and down motion (like 'stomping') than a back and forth motion (like swaying). That way you press the seams straight and flat, whereas ironing can sometimes make the seams go off grain (crooked).  For 'layer', they want you to trim the edges in layers to decrease bulkiness. Generally speaking your edges should end up about even when sewn and all those layers will create a lot a excess."

Good luck!!!  ""A press cloth, also known as a pressing cloth, is used to protect fabrics from a hot iron. Without a press cloth, delicate fabrics, such as silk, may show scorch marks from a hot iron or become discolored from the heat.

I know very little about sewing, but I would love to make something very similar. Do you have other sewing experience? How were you able to adjust the pattern for that neckline?"
sewing,3bbepi,Carpe_PerDiem,2,Sun Jun 28 00:58:38 2015 UTC,"Well my mother used to make my baby dresses, frilly type of stuff but really amazing. We still have the clothes I should post them here sometime. As I got older I was interested in it mostly because no other teen I knew could say they made their own skirt and I wanted to be that kid. (I was an annoying hipster before I even knew what that was.)  Anyway, I started with skirts but I always procrastinated with dresses I was and still am horrible with following though on a project. So instead of making my own clothes I started thrifting. I would pick out anything in the stores I wanted because of the magic of re-sizing. I think that is where most of my experience came from that. I would tear a part dresses I have gotten pretty good at tailoring for myself. Though it all looks good on the outside, the inside is horrible lines are everywhere, there is no lining so everything is exposed, my friend made a joke because I am too lazy to put in lining I should make a clothing line an call it ""Ugly on the Inside"".  Also seriously having a dressform is the best thing in the world! Helped out so much so many times. So easy to make darts that way.   As for the pattern I took the skirt straight from McCalls m7084 because that skirt is just great, the bodice I took from a 90's pattern I bought in a thrift store (Sometimes they have patterns) But edited to be much more fitted (as it was very airy before) I put in the darts and I didn't want to go to the store and buy a load of buttons so I just sewed the front bodice and skirt up and folded in the top part to make the V neckline. Then just added in a zipper."
sewing,3bbepi,Carpe_PerDiem,1 point,Sun Jun 28 06:10:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for replying! Sounds like getting into thrifting and tailoring is a really good intro to sewing. It's not the best ever, but I live super close to a Goodwill, so maybe I'll just start lurking around there more. Or trying skirts first, like you did. I don't have a dressform because I don't really have a dedicated sewing area as yet, and I haven't invested much money into it. But I will keep that in mind if I get more serious!  Thanks for the pattern information. I can totally agree about not wanting to add that many buttons. I absolutely love your style, so I'm looking forward to any future projects you finish and share! And I wouldn't care; I would totally buy your clothing line. Especially for the name!"
sewing,3bbepi,Carpe_PerDiem,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:51:23 2015 UTC,Yeah you should wait until you are dedicated to sewing before you get a dressform I think mine was $150 or below I'm not sure my brother got it for me. But a dressform makes it easier to tailor as well.

sewing,3bbepi,thyrza,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:06:17 2015 UTC,"sorry- the skirt needs more pressing - the seams are puckering a bit- That might be from pressing or from tension issues. and it doesn't look pressed at the pocket at all.   The fabric choice is just too lightweight for this sort of fitted dress. There isn't enough body/weight to give a nice swing to the skirt. It might be better if it were lined but a heavier fabric would definitely help.  It is certainly 10,000 times better than the second dress I ever made was though, so keep on going- especially if you're having fun. I'll always be happy to critique from afar ; )  The neckline facing is perfect and the seams on the bodice are perfect too."
sewing,3bbepi,thyrza,1 point,Sun Jun 28 10:46:47 2015 UTC,"It might be a grain line issue. The fading indicates that it's a vintage fabric and I can see the pattern sort of veering up in the right back shoulder while the CB looks straight. The grain needed to be trued before cutting since it looks like it warped with age. Not a lot of people know to do that. My guess is the fabric won't last long; but the pattern is good and OP has the skills to remake in a heavier weight (a brushed cotton would be nice) or line it when the time comes.  OP, ya did pretty good. The neckline stitching is especially nice. How's the fit?  If you want to fix the fading, you might try color removing followed by an indigo dye. Make sure to wash with fels naphtha first, though to get it free of depris and oils."
sewing,3bbepi,thyrza,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:57:13 2015 UTC,Honestly I don't know anything about a grain line so there is probably something about that. Also yes it is vintage fabric nice eye.

Fake leather would be a Very bad idea. Natural fibres could work depending on the design, if it's very intricate it won't cause it will fray and rip, but some things could work. A mix of organic and synthetic is a viable option as it won't melt and distort as much as a completely synthetic fabric, but will still get sealed edges. Avoid anything with latex or elastane or in any other way stretchy. Felted fabrics could work. You should get some samples and test them out by burning them, for instance with a stick of incense or something and just poke holes in it to see how it reacts to heat. If it stays flat and the edges can be touched and pull without fraying you should be fine :)"
sewing,3bbw5p,Clobbersaurus7,10,Sat Jun 27 19:12:15 2015 UTC,"This question comes up a lot.  If your going to do light weight sewing (think clothing but not jeans) then you can't go wrong with a brother. If you put anything heavy through it then its going to die (heavy canvas or denim). I have a few brother machines and they are cheep and will last as LONG as you treat them right. They are fairly fast and feature rich (1 step button holes are a thing of wonder)  That having been said, only spend 1/2 your budget on your machine. The rest you should spend on all the other things your going to need, seam gauge, iron, hams (not the kind you eat), seam ripper, tailors awl (get this best 10 bucks I ever spent) pins, pin cushion, a container to keep all of it, good scissors (for both trimming and cutting). Buy this stuff on line, as it will be MUCH cheeper than going to retail for it!  You will also want a few starting patterns and some fabric. Make sure you stay away from stretch fabrics for your first project, and pick something easy.   Good luck and can't wait to see what you do with your new hobby!"

They aren't wrong at all, and it just depends on what your going to do! My brothers have lasted so long because I don't do anything heavy with them at all, ever. That means no jeans, no heavy canvas, ""normal"" weights of threads and so on. In trade for this limitation I get zig zags, fancy stitches, easy button holes, lots of ""features"" like button advance.  In this regard sewing machines are like vehicles, and most ""modern"" machines are with their plastic gearing are minivans. You can haul the kids on a road trip, go to work every day, and shove some wood from the big box store in there... you wouldn't try to bring enough wood for a back yard shed in it though.   These older machines are pickup trucks, they do ONE thing well (straight stitch) and if you get one sturdy enough theres almost nothing it can't take on! You can buy a ""new"" machine with lots of the same qualities but it comes with a hefty price tag and all the same limits!   Old machines like old cars are picky! They are a joy to use when they work, and will keep doing so as long as you take care of them, and that may be part of the fun for you!   In the end it is a personal choice, based more on what you want to do and your patience for starting new things! I will say that my statement about 1/2 your budget going to supplies still stands no matter what way you go!"

I have even seen some Pfaff130s that people use for sewing leather, but I use mine for all purpose so I have it adjusted to those settings.  My Pfaff130 also has zigzag...and a million other stitches because it is the fancy model with an attachment called a coffee grinder that fits on the back of the main body. Just like zer00eyz, I would advise that you just look carefully at all the features of any machine and determine what you will mainly use if for before you buy."

sewing,3bbw5p,HomeEcQueen,2,Sat Jun 27 23:19:22 2015 UTC,"The coffee grinder attachment was on the machine when I got it. I have used it a little, mostly for making fancy stitches on normal weight fabrics - including denim. I have not worked with leather. My machine is adjusted for all purpose sewing.   If you wanted to work on leather you could - but it would need to be adjusted for that. Plus you would need really huge industrial needles. I don't know whether or not the differential feed system (the feed dogs) would have to be disengaged and a walking foot used when sewing leather. I can imagine that it would be necessary when sewing something so thick. The purpose of the walking foot, of course, to feed both the top and bottom layers evenly. A walking foot is a cumbersome attachment though.  Since machine shanks are so different you would need one that allowed for the attachment itself and one that still gave you adequate room for sewing through quite a bit of thickness.   The walking foot I have was one that fit another machine I used to use and it fortunately worked with my Pfaff130. I have not sewn anything thicker than denim with it though."

sewing,3bbw5p,confluence,7,Mon Jun 29 16:44:43 2015 UTC,"I'm going to be that person (there's always at least one) and suggest that you look for a vintage machine in your local classifieds or in local repair / thrift shops. Advantages: can be ridiculously cheap (or free); the good models are well-made and last forever. Disadvantages: the oldest models don't have zigzag; when you enter the beige era there are some dud models which use nonstandard parts or have nylon gears; there's a risk that a machine of unknown provenance may be irreparably damaged.  So you can get a very good machine at a very low cost, which lowers the bar to entry into the hobby substantially. But you need to do a bit of research to understand exactly what a particular model can and can't do, whether it's considered a good model, and how to recognise a machine in good working order. And that takes more time and effort than just getting a new machine.  If you have the time and you want to try this option, you can ask in here for more help (identifying machines, finding other relevant resources online, etc.)."

I would also make sure that someone shows you how to thread the machine before you leave, just in case there are weird idiosyncrasies in threading (tiny hooks that are hard to see, etc). I also like single-step buttonholer's, but that's kind of a bonus.   Conversely, some beginner-focused sewing machine features get kind of annoying after much practice. My mom got me my machine when I was in second grade, so she wanted a lot of safety features. I hate that my machine won't start until the presser foot is down--sometimes when I sew/handcrank over thicker amounts of fabric, the alarm will ding and the machine stops.   As for the ""coffee-grinder"" attachment, you might also just consider specialty unbranded sewing feet. My regular foot works fine for jeans, and you can get a teflon foot for sewing (p)leather."

What you should look for is something that is made of metal and weighs a ton. The newer models have plastic parts/gears, and are essentially worthless. Believe it or not there are hundreds of thousands of these old beauties in closets or attics gathering dust. I see them all the time at yard sales and at thrift shops. People don't love them anymore. It is sad. I want to adopt them all.  Parts are still available for them and you will be happier sewing with better quality equipment. I'd rather have an old machine any day. The one I sew on now is a Pfaff made in West Germany in 1952. Best machine I've ever owned.  The only drawback to the old girls is that many of them do not have free-arms....a small detachable sewing bed that allows for sewing tiny or small items easier.

You know how when you hem jeans it's always hard to get over the ""hump""  of that thick flat felled seam allowance without having a bunch of tiny stitches and then a giant one where you have had to manually pull the fabric through? This feature will allow  you to hem jeans  with even stitches  because it will feed the fabric through with the feed dogs AND the walking foot. It is great for stuff like that and will also be awesome for top stitching vinyl but I like it for a lot of other fabrics too. I do not work for Pfaff.

Its 2.50 for a 10 pack at local retail where I live (and probably close to the same where you are). I can buy 100 of them for $12 before shipping online. Cones of sewing thread are $4 to $6 online before shipping for 6000 yards, $2 for 200 at retail. Fabric prices are also about the same if you shop around there are deals to be found. If your going to buy this sort of stuff shipping is what will kill you, however if you buy a few items at once then you can get that down to a reasonable cost per item. Buying fabric online is interesting, I have developed some relationships with fabric district dealers who are pretty far away from where I live by making repeat purchases with them. If I need something I can send them a sample + description and they will keep an eye out for me. Im to the point where its better, and cheeper, for me to buy 100 yards of something at a discount than ""just what I need"" at retail.   Remember your time is valuable, so don't be afraid to spend some money to reclaim time (your being frugal not cheep right!)

A whole section on tools would be great. There are tons of them that folks SHOULD have but don't. Tailors awl, Ham(s), scissors (not just giant cutting scissors), seam ripper, seam gauge, marking tools, a notcher vs cutting V's into or out of the fabric  Some of the basics of applique would be good  Under vinyl it should be tape + clips (binder clips is what i use)  A section on thread would be awesome as well, cover the standards used to measure, types, weights and so on.

sewing,3b6yua,Sm00chie,3,Fri Jun 26 16:01:17 2015 UTC,"For your courses, is each class just one-on-one or are you doing any group sessions?  In my beginner sewing class, we all started out with the same project and learned everything in your curriculum using that project. That way, we got hands on experience instead of just being talked at and looking at examples. If I remember correctly, we ended up making a pair of cotton boxer shorts (for woven fabric lesson) and then a tank top (for knit pattern lesson). Intermediate and advanced sewers had the option to bring more advanced patterns to sew or to brush up on topics they were slacking on.  To learn stitches and seams, we were shown an example, then shown how to set up the machine, watched them sew it, then we did it ourselves. A different class had us use felt sheets and yarn with big plastic needles to practice beforehand and I think that was too kindergarden style.  For your beginners, I would even go so far as to have a pre-planned kit outlined that they can either purchase themselves at the store or they can purchase from you at the first class. The kit could include the type of fabric needed, machine needles, a pin cushion, pins, bobbins, and coordinated thread. Scissors optional, because I know those can be pricey. But the other parts of the kit may be dependent on each student and sharing these may prove troublesome (lost bobbins, bent pins, different color fabrics/threads, etc.) And we kept our own things in a tote box to bring to class each time."

Maybe also a bit about wearing ease and seam allowances - picking a size to cut out can be a challenge for beginners, because there's a lot of mismatch between pattern and commercial sizing.  At least these are struggles I've noted with my students - your list overall looks pretty great!"

I wish I can just dump all of the resources I used during then, but that might be too over the top. :)  I would maybe add something about measuring, seam allowances (1/4,3/8, etc) and when they are used, and maybe just reading a ruler in general.  A good book I always like to suggest is http://www.amazon.com/Sewing-Secrets-Fashion-Industry-Methods/dp/0875969801   Maybe include something in the different fabrics about denim, leather, and other thicker fabrics.  Would you cover types of ironing devices such as sleeve roll, point presser, clapper, ham, etc? Maybe include facings and methods for finishing raw edges and insides of garments in the ""extras"". Other than that, I would add things like elastic, pleats, different seams like flat felled and french like some other redditers have suggested.   I agree with others by using samples. That was the format I used for the classes I taught. After completing a set of samples, students did a project that relates to the samples such as a skirt or other garment. The costuming department in the theater area did pillows that had quilted areas of different techniques (curved seams, buttons, etc.) which works as well."

I've also fallen out of love with garment sewing over the last year, and she has just started, so things that are very new to her (invisible zippers, elastic waistbands, etc.) are old hat to me, and not particularly interesting."

sewing,3b5q7h,Thread_for_brains,25,Fri Jun 26 04:42:48 2015 UTC,"I think one of the bigger issues here is the waist to bust ratio. The bigger the ratio, and you have a petite waist and larger bust, then you're gonna have trouble fitting the pattern to your body. Usually I would need a bigger bust dart or maybe two. I would also might do one more seam to get a better fit. It depends on how fitted you want the bodice to be.   Try pinning a bigger bust dart. But not too much, otherwise the fabric will look weird and stretched. The bodice is also too long in the back. Shorten only the back piece at the shoulders, the front bodice looks fine in the length and around your shoulders. When you do this, open the shoulder seams and push the back fabric up until it looks good, and then pin it there.  And, you really can't pin yourself, it's a pain. Ask someone for help. Good luck!"
sewing,3b5q7h,m0liny,8,Fri Jun 26 08:47:37 2015 UTC,"I am thinking along the same lines. I think this bodice fits you pretty well for Butterick 5748.  The pattern you picked is meant to be fitted, not form-fitting.  Most of those retro patterns in the Butterick line aren't meant to be tight, but the pictures make them look rounded and body contoured.  On someone with alot less curves, it could look form fitting, but you would need a different patten to make that happen, or decide to go with the bullet bra look.  Speaking of the bullet bra look... http://pintuckstyle.blogspot.com/2014/05/audreys-sabrina-dress-how-to-make-it.html  This is a pretty good post about someone making a dress almost exactly like this.  Notice in the picture Aubrey is wearing a similar dress, and even as petite as she was the darts look extra long and she's rockin' the bullet bra look.  In her dress it looks like it used heavy fabric and a lining to help pull off the style.  Edit: I guess I was tired and didn't look closely.

My daughter is shaped the same way so I have had to learn to alter patterns and clothes to fit. I agree with KOCHIPOLK in that you need to go down at least a size on the pattern. Rule of thumb for picking the right sized pattern for busty ladies is to use your upper bust measurement instead of your full bust measurement. Then you have to do a full bust adjustment. EATTHISSHOE has a good point too, but I actually think by going down a size or two might solve this because the bodice will be shorter and will hit you in the right place. Don't be overwhelmed. Once you learn how to do it, the FTB will be second nature."

sewing,3b5q7h,Anne314,3,Sat Jun 27 01:35:47 2015 UTC,"Looks like it is too tight in the hip area, so the fabric is riding up. I'm basing this on how the fabric seems loose on all sides in the vertical dimension, correct me if I'm wrong.  Some ideas to start:   Try folding the bottom 1"" up as though it were a hem, if the fabric seems to fit better and fall straighter, then it may be that the waist is too high on the pattern. Try letting out the side seams, and darts if necessary at the bottom to see if the fabric falls lower.   Think of the bottom of the garment as a circle, if that circle is the width of your waist, but not your hips, then it will get stuck hanging on your hips. Make it larger and it falls lower and the shape of the garment shows more clearly when the seam lines are straightened."

sewing,3b247e,iron-on,5,Thu Jun 25 10:27:34 2015 UTC,"...the corset is too small? If it closes before you're fully cinched, wouldn't that make it big? & also what did you use for a front closure? It looks awesome & I am jealous, I can't get myself to make another because stitching the boning is so teeeediiooouus....."
sewing,3b247e,iron-on,3,Thu Jun 25 16:23:43 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I meant too big! Haha. That's what I get for trying to reddit at 4 in the morning.  Corsets are awesome, but they are also the worst. :S sooo many little pieces to cut out and stitch! I might stick to buying mine from now on.  The front is a sturdy sport zipper, heavily interfaced and reinforced. I'm hoping it'll hold. Maybe it's good that it doesn't cinch too tightly! I'd be so bummed if my zipper failed.   I thought about doing busks or something, but I want to use this one onstage and busks mostly just get in your way onstage. :P the back laces as usual."
sewing,3b247e,WildlingWoman,2,Thu Jun 25 17:51:34 2015 UTC,"i would imagine that a busk would catch too much light onstage? & it is good it's not tight-laced, not only would dancing and singing in such a thing resulting in fainting, but i have had zippers fail on me before... not good when you're trying (albeit vaguely) to be modest hehe"

I drafted the pattern off of a corset that fits me great, using the same type of base fabric. There really shouldn't have been any size discrepancies. I dunno. :S  I have a 25"" waist, used a 22"" corset for reference. I should be able to get plenty of cinch, as I do with my others of the same style (I have about eight corsets from the same brand as the one I copied). It looks nice but no cinch. That's okay though - still looks alright! :)"

sewing,3b247e,BrokeWhoregan,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:56:13 2015 UTC,"Did you use coutil fabric or something similar? Different fabrics and fibers will stretch at different rates. This is why corset-makers often will use coutil as their base fabric, as it has very little give."

sewing,3aza8o,ultimatecolour,28,Wed Jun 24 19:10:35 2015 UTC,"Of course! I assembled the dress before dyeing - a navy blue slightly stretchy base dress, then lots of black chiffon hand stitched on top. Then I added two sections in a dark dusty pink silk, then a big section of white silk chiffon. I then sprayed on watered down black silk paint while the dress was hanging up to help the sections blend at the edges (this stage shown here). Once this was dry I lay it down on a table (covered in plastic), and mixed up procion fibre reactive dyes in magenta, yellow, and cyan. I then applied these with a paintbrush, mixing colours and spraying with water as I went to help blend on the fabric. I then wrapped that up in plastic and left it to cure overnight. Then rinsed in the shower until water runs clear, left to dry. Put back on mannequin, take outside, and spray with metallic copper spray (not actually designed for fabric). Then hand sewed all the rhinestones on, and ta-da! I have no intention of washing it at any point so can't comment on colour-fastness!"

I think velcro would be easiest and most secure. Snaps would leave weird puckers. The problem with velcro is that you will have stiff patches which could make the dress wear oddly.  If you picked a pattern, like an apron dress, you could take advantage of the square bib and large pockets, and make those places for interchangeable patches. The flat parts won't look funny when ""stiffened"" by the velcro. You could start building up library of standard fixed ""add-on patches"" to build out your Ms. Fizzle. And if you use a sleeveless pattern that you wear a shirt under, you could incorporate special shirts or just change out colors to easily give you outfits more variation.  Like maybe something like the variation on the right: http://www.amazon.com/McCalls-Sample-Sewing-Pattern-Butcher/dp/B003Z81HH4/"

sewing,3az3iu,MuseTerpsichore,2,Wed Jun 24 18:33:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I used this tutorial to make it with a few mods:     The button pouch is bigger than the pattern. The zipper is 8"" instead of 6"". I don't have a printer, so I guestimated when drawing the template. I didn't use interfacing for the straps. Since I used medium weight linen, it's heavy enough to hold everything up and to stand up to wear and tear. Since my fabric had started to fray by the time I sewed the front to back and attached the straps (and the pouch pieces were smaller than 1""), I put the edges of the pack inside the straps and stitched an X inside of a box on either side to secure them."

sewing,3b2d6q,ChasingSloths,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:06:58 2015 UTC,I think something drapey and bias cut like this is a case where it's really important to have similar fabric for your toile - hopefully the fabric change will help.
sewing,3b2d6q,lynaevm,5,Thu Jun 25 21:38:17 2015 UTC,"Welcome the wild, weird word of bias fitting....  No, you can't really make an adjustment like you pinned out.  You could shorten the whole dress from near the waist point, which might put the diagonal seam on a more flattering part of your body, but I think the main problem is your mock-up fabric, as people have already pointed out, and your diagonal seam.    A lot of what makes bias cut dresses work so wonderfully is the weight of the fabric itself pulls the fabric close to the body, clinging and skimming.  So if your fabric doesn't have enough bias give to it, or doesn't have enough weight, then it won't accurately tell you what will happen in crepe-back satin, a fabric that has quite a bit of weight do it.  But specificially, I think whats making you think you look bulky in the dress is that the diagonal seam isn't laying right -- you can see in the last picture that the top portion is gathering into the skirt.  This may be fixed as easily as clipping the seam allowances of the skirt portion (the curve will make them try to pull up), tugging at the seam so the stitches dont' sit too tight, or cutting the skirt with an extra 1/4 or 1/2 inch at the side seam so it cant' draw the seam in.  Just a future hint for fitting/problem solving bias.  Instead of pinning a dart or tightening a side seam right where you feel like a bias dress is too big, follow the straight grain of the fabric from the trouble spot and tug on it where it hits an edge... sometimes tweaking an armscye can change the waist fit, or taking it in by the boob can make the hip drape better, because thats where the pull on the bias is coming from.  It takes some practice."
sewing,3b2d6q,velvetjones01,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:19:00 2015 UTC,"Yes!  The skirt is definitely an issue.  No joke, the instructions say to 'stretch the skirt to fit the bodice front' and you have to stretch it for about 1/3 of its length.  I might add a slight amount at the side seams of the skirt to prevent this issue a bit.  I haven't actually clipped my seam allowances in this picture, but I'll give that a go.    Thank you so much for the bias fitting tip - maybe there is somewhere else I can tweak (in a similar fabric!).  I'm going to try that ASAP and get to this."
sewing,3b2d6q,kaa_acklie,2,Fri Jun 26 11:55:15 2015 UTC,"Did you let the dress hang for a bit?  Muslin is flattering on exactly nobody, and it's hard to separate what is a fit issue v what is a fabric issue.  Try giving it a tug downward in the front see if that improves things. Also make sure you're wearing good foundation garments when you do the next fitting. Pretty dress, I hope you post the FO. Good luck!"

While it looks good on the applique face of the owl, there's no point in using it in the inside to connect the two pieces together.  Try using a ladder stitch for a relatively invisible seam when closing up the owls."
sewing,3b24xz,Aari_G,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:33:54 2015 UTC,"Yep, I was using blanket stitch as i wasn't sure what other stitch to use. I understand what you mean it being mainly decorative though.   What I can't quite get my head around with ladder stitch is that when I am using felt, pushing the needle horizontally through a piece of felt (as opposed to from one side of it clean through to the other side, as I would due during blanket stitch etc.)  seems to just pull the felt apart? Maybe I am doing something wrong."
sewing,3b24xz,ChasingSloths,3,Thu Jun 25 13:19:12 2015 UTC,"If you're turning your seams inside out it looks like you need to adjust your stitch length and tension, so the stitches are tighter and the seam isn't able to pull apart when under any kind of stress. For seams that are on the inside I'd go for a backstitch, rather than blanket stitch, as it's stronger and easier to control."

sewing,3axrr8,nikkistl,3,Wed Jun 24 11:26:30 2015 UTC,"Holy shit gimme.  Like seriously, pardon my French, but I have these freakishly tiny feet that only fit into kids' sizes, and having cute, adult-looking shoes that last is something I've all but given up on. And a minimalist / barefoot fabric sole?! Sign me right the eff up! This is a lifesaver! :D"
sewing,3axrr8,Navi1101,2,Wed Jun 24 18:06:40 2015 UTC,"Size 5 1/2 here, I feel your pain."
sewing,3axrr8,olbluejayburger,3,Wed Jun 24 18:26:20 2015 UTC,"Lucky you. :/ I run between a 1 and 4 in most brands, and can rarely fit into a 5 if they run really small. I'm REALLY freakishly tiny.  So far, I've just been glad that Payless carries some of their women's flats styles down into kids' sizes, so I'm not completely stuck with shoes that have cartoon characters on them (though my equally tiny sister and her five-year-old daughter sometimes get matching light-up sneakers or Disney Princess snowboots, which is hella cute). But kids' shoes are almost universally cheaply made, since they're meant to be outgrown before they wear out, and not-cheaply-made shoes aren't really available when my only option is Payless anyway. I can never buy online, because I'm never sure what will fit me or not, and I know that most shoes won't, and will have to be returned anyway.  I and my trusty sewing machine have conquered all other aspects of my wardrobe - hemming up pants, fitting shirt sides, shortening sleeves, widening collars, curvening hips, even a custom utility belt when I got sick of carrying a purse - but shoes were the one article of clothing that I thought remained forever out of my reach - I had resigned myself to always being a slave to the whims of the manufacturers and their size ranges that don't include the likes of me. UNTIL NOW! BWAHAHAHAHA!! AT LAST, THE SWEET TASTE OF FREEDOM!!! I just need to get me a can of Plastidip, and I know felt is on sale at my friendly local fabric shop..... >:D"
sewing,3b1zo6,TraLaLa7,1 point,Thu Jun 25 09:16:19 2015 UTC,Oh and could I make it in a cotton lace fabric?
sewing,3b1zo6,zAp0ll0,1 point,Thu Jun 25 09:16:34 2015 UTC,"The skirt she's wearing is I think gored. Simplicity has this pattern http://www.simplicity.com/p-6072-misses-skirts.aspx  Simplicityalso has a pattern that is definitely suitable for cotton lace overlay, its fuller in the skirt than what Mel B is wearing but IMO its more flattering, still sits at the natural waist. http://www.simplicity.com/p-12159-misses-34-circle-skirt-with-length-variations.aspx#t-0 hope this points you in the right direction!"
sewing,3b0r5i,herownhero,3,Thu Jun 25 01:17:21 2015 UTC,"You should start with a few out of the box patterns (assuming your looking at the first two pictures):  http://www.simplicity.com/p-1798-misses-dresses.aspx might be a nice foundation  or this one  http://www.simplicity.com/p-9581-misses-disney-princess-costume.aspx  you could add straps to a corset, or find something that works in a stretch... the dress itself is fairly simple, so its going to be more about fabric selection and embellishment.  Who is the character anyway?"
sewing,3b0r5i,zer00eyz,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:30:19 2015 UTC,"Holy cow, that Disney one might just be perfect!!! Thank you!  The first character is Yuno from Mirai Nikki (Future Diary), she's absolutely crazy and I love it. The second character is Yona from Akatsuki no Yona, she is great too."
sewing,3ayych,lemonoftroy,2,Wed Jun 24 16:57:57 2015 UTC,"Simplicity 1419 looks a lot like what you want, but it isn't a plus size pattern."
sewing,3ayych,adelajoy,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:57:50 2015 UTC,do you need size 20-22 us rtw or size 20-22 in patterns? cause those are two very different things.  This pattern goes up to pattern size 22. You can make View A and use the collar from View B: http://sewing.patternreview.com/Patterns/66836  This pattern goes up to pattern size 24. You can make View A and use the collar from View B: http://sewing.patternreview.com/Patterns/64819  This pattern goes up to pattern size 20: http://sewing.patternreview.com/Patterns/67797

sewing,3ayahf,kirstinalexis,2,Wed Jun 24 13:57:12 2015 UTC,"It's not all that fitted, but the Colette Sorbetto top looks very simple. 2 pieces, no buttonholes, and a bias tape finish. I haven't tried any of the Colette patterns but I believe they're drafted for a C cup rather than a B. Perhaps I misunderstand the website but I think this is a free digital pattern? Apologies if I'm incorrect. Happy sewing, I hope you find something :)  {https://www.colettepatterns.com/sewing/sorbetto}"
sewing,3ayahf,gabi914,2,Wed Jun 24 16:40:02 2015 UTC,That website is great :) Thanks I didn't know that even existed.
sewing,3ayahf,DuckyParts,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:28:19 2015 UTC,"It is a pretty simple pattern, I sewed it up yesterday. And yes it is a free pattern, which is great, but you have to assemble it yourself, which is less great :)"
sewing,3ayahf,gabi914,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:12:40 2015 UTC,"After taking a look at it I went ahead and got it! Hopefully I can whip it up without too much weird stuff happening. Is it truly ""less great"" if I don't have to put pants on to get a pattern? Some days is definitely rather sit on the floor with tape than go through the rigmarole of getting ready to go out :P"
sewing,3azyx6,Erzsabet,3,Wed Jun 24 21:28:24 2015 UTC,"I've decided I need more running skirts in my life.  Here's a recent one from the American Heart Association 5k.  I had to make sure I stood out to impress some folks.  What better way to stand out than with an adorable skirt made from dance spandex with sewn-in runderwear and a custom-printed running top?  After a successful Sailor Moon tutu running costume (again, dance spandex and tulle), I've had a lot of fun making more themed running attire for myself and my kids.  Here we have Wreck-It Ralph and Taffyta Muttonfudge, Candlehead and Fix-It Felix, and Vanellope Von Schweetz.  Candlehead thoroughly enjoys her first sports bra, and loves the bow on the back.  After I make a few more running skirts to match some of my past race shirts, I'll be working on a My Little Pony set of running costumes for the upcoming Glow Run in August."

If you are not confident machine sewing small pieces, def do you first couple by hand first.  There are lots of teddy bear kits on Etsy, which might be a good place to start.  Invest in some tools: little pliers for cotter joints, a stuffer tool, curved needle for ears.  There are lots of tutorials online but this book is the best reference I've found   The Encyclopedia of Teddy Bear Making Techniques https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1844488098/ref=cm_sw_r_awd_QdLIvbZZSSZGF  And most importantly, take your time and have fun x"
