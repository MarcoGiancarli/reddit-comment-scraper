BMW,3e0oh5,New_Horiz0ns,-7,Tue Jul 21 19:20:22 2015 UTC,You will learn to hate it as soon as you figure out you bought one of the most underpowered BMW.
BMW,3e0oh5,Lebran,3,Tue Jul 21 08:26:57 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind basically every young driver in the UK has been pootling around in a 1 or 1.2 litre vauxhall or fiat for the first couple of years of driving. I had 3 points on my license at 18 and my insurance on a 1.3 litre Ford Ka was $5000 a year. More than the car was worth.   The 118i will feel plenty powerful enough for most young guys in the UK, don't worry."
BMW,3e0oh5,dmkc,-8,Tue Jul 21 09:32:52 2015 UTC,"I'm from the UK also. & I used to have a 120d auto at 20yrs old. That was just enough power to compensate for the stiff ride. In fact it felt faster a lot faster than it actually was because the engine made a nice amount of torque & the auto box would deliver it better than I could.   But, a small petrol powered 1 series seems like a very bad decision, because there is no power (not that the 120d had a lot, only 163bhp) but the petrols also have half the torque available. In essence it's a slow hatchback with very stiff suspension & bad fuel economy. If your young & living in Britain, u only buy one of these to impress your mates, because from a practical point of view it fails to live up to what a VW Golf can provide.   There is the argument of economy, but that is a false belief. A golf or similar hatchback will have cheaper insurance, tax & fuel economy. Plus it will be more practical with actual back seats, not the type BMW use where they are cutt off & provide no thigh support.   Anyway you look at the petrol powerd & even the 116d, 118d, they are not worth it. A decent package is the 120d, its right in the midlle. & obviously the 130i = tons of fun. But the perfect balance for power, economy is the 123d"
BMW,3e0oh5,Lebran,8,Tue Jul 21 10:25:36 2015 UTC,"How is a 2 litre 140-150 bhp petrol BMW not enough car for someone in there early 20's? Why does everyone have to buy to your standards? 118d's and i's are adequately powerful enough for 90% of the population.  How are you getting at someone in a BMW forum for taking a 118i over a golf. Its a great car, looks in good nick and is affodable to run. Everyone in this sub needs to get off this shit of calling people out, especially younger guys, for having smaller engined cars! Its great they are getting into BMW, we should be encouraging people to post whatever car they own from a 114i to i8's, and not holding them to the same standards you have!   On that note, why are you even in here? There are probably more sensible options to buy over 90% of BMW's, thats not what owning a BMW is about."
BMW,3e0oh5,Deccarrin,-7,Tue Jul 21 11:26:49 2015 UTC,"How does the age of the owner, reflect any differently on the package a car provides? The car gets evaluated on what it provides, not on, how a potential owner may perceive it.  The 118i is what it is. A car unfit for purpose. It has a stiff suspension & agile steering but lacks the power to put it to use. Actually the 07 model has electric steering, so even better suite to trodding along in traffic.  Regardless, you seem to think that the 118i is great. So i will just leave it at lets agree to disagree."
BMW,3e0oh5,lolokaybra,6,Tue Jul 21 11:39:17 2015 UTC,"My or your opinion on the 118i is irrelevant! this is a BMW community, if you don't have something nice to say to someone who is clearly super happy with their new purchase, don't say anything at all!   EDIT: Looking through your post history, its clear you need to tell everyone how shit there choices are to maybe make yours feel more adequate? Things like telling guys who have just bought beautiful E46 M3's that they have 'shitty rims' even though they are the original M3 wheels.   Mate. You drive a 2005 320d se.

I accept you don't love BMWs as much as myself or OP. But we chose our cars for our financial position and our love of BMW. You don't have those restrictions great! Go buy yourself a Skoda Octavia VRS It's faster and cheaper than the 320d. But I'm going to keep buying the best BMW I can afford because these are the cars I love.  For clarity sake, I don't know if the 118i is good at all, never driven one. Heck OP might have got a slammin deal from fred down the road. But it's beautiful and it makes him happy."
BMW,3e0oh5,damnyou777,2,Tue Jul 21 11:45:57 2015 UTC,Still a dick move to call someone's new car a POS.
BMW,3e0oh5,Lee1138,3,Tue Jul 21 15:50:25 2015 UTC,"I agree with what you're saying when it comes to the logical choice at this price/performance is actually a golf. But you can't take away the fact the BMW will put a smile on your face when you get in, and you turn around and look at it whenever you park it and walk away. I've always loved BMW's and finally got my chance at buying one a few weeks ago. I could have opted for the more powerful 320d or even a 330d. But the insurance difference for me was £400~ with the 318d, to £800~ with the 320d. That's a huge huge difference for a 23 yr old graduate. Also bare in mind I'm satisfying my parents by getting something I won't ""kill myself"" in. Now, I wish I'd have something more powerful. 100%. And I could have had a similar passat/insignia/whatever that may well be faster and cheaper economy. But damn I wanted this car. It's beautiful, it's still fun to drive, it's a fucking tonne faster than my 20 yr old 1l 206. And I smile every damn time I get in it and don't think I'll ever stop.  Also I can upgrade when I have the mula in a few years and get something reaally fast. And will have stepped up to it, instead of putting my foot to the floor and wrapping myself around a tree.  Another edit! I fucking ADORE the sound of this car at high revs. The grumble is beautiful. Sure the roar of a v6/v8 is probably more satisfying but I kinda like how this chugs. I also like how i can put my foot to the floor in 3rd hear that sound and not smash into a lampost at 85mph on a ring road."

I bought my car with nothing done to it. From some shoddy dealer who just sold luxury cars and knew nothing about them.  I got mine for 6200. I should have bought it for 5200 but he had a very hard head.  Now,  it's resale value is probably the same as I bought it.  I would ask the seller if anything has been changed and at what mileage. Take off - $50 for everything he hasn't done (if you're mechanically inclined),  and more for suspension parts if they haven't been replaced.  A suspension overhaul kit costs around $500. My suspension was OK at 97k, but not nearly as tight as it should be.  If I were you,  get the price  a little lower,  then work on it yourself. A 2004 325xi in good shape is worth up to 7k."

BMW,3e0uid,fire2thesky,2,Tue Jul 21 02:20:47 2015 UTC,Airbag shrapnel?  Didn't know e39's were affected as well.
BMW,3e0uid,Getsully,2,Tue Jul 21 02:37:30 2015 UTC,I went to https://vinrcl.safercar.gov/vin/ and looked up my VIN. It shows it as an open recall.
BMW,3e0uid,isjpanda,0,Tue Jul 21 11:43:33 2015 UTC,"From my understanding only e46s are affected, although the e46 took some inspiration from the e39 they don't use the same airbags so should be alright."
BMW,3e0uid,redditvicehomework,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:29:07 2015 UTC,M5 and e46 M3 steering wheel is the same airbag.
BMW,3e0uid,Tohafat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:49:15 2015 UTC,Wow I had no idea about this. Apparently humid region cars are affected the most and I just happen to live in the turkish sauna that is Houston.

BMW,3e3i8x,FreshSeed,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:55:48 2015 UTC,Use the proper fuel from now on. So long as you werent hammering on it all over the place there should be no damage.
BMW,3e3i8x,rudbri93,0,Tue Jul 21 17:57:58 2015 UTC,Wat kind of problems could occur?
BMW,3e3i8x,rudbri93,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:00:48 2015 UTC,"Using lower octane will cause what we call pinging, fuel igniting before the car intends it too. The car will adjust fuel and ignition timing to compensate for this and prevent damage, at the cost of fuel economy and power. It can only do this within a certain range, if you use too low octane fuel and are driving aggressively you can still cause pinging. This could eventually lead to damaged pistons/head/valves so always use the proper fuel. If the engine is running fine and smooth, you should be just fine, usually this kind of damage takes a while to occur."
BMW,3e3i8x,freshofftheboat00,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:05:09 2015 UTC,I put 87 and blew a couple ignition coils. Could this be related or did it just happen at the same time?
BMW,3e3i8x,rudbri93,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:28:50 2015 UTC,"likely just old coils, but it wasnt helpin anythin"
BMW,3e3i8x,rudbri93,0,Tue Jul 21 19:34:54 2015 UTC,"Thank you, this is my first car and I didnt even know some cars require a certain quality of gas"
BMW,3e3i8x,eurotrash_e36,-1,Tue Jul 21 18:22:54 2015 UTC,"Yea, itll be in the owners manual, or on the fuel door/fuel cap sometimes. Use that and you will be fine."
BMW,3e3i8x,e92user,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:25:22 2015 UTC,Or even a sticker on the gauge cluster! Both my e36's had one
BMW,3e3i8x,Intense_introvert,0,Tue Jul 21 21:24:42 2015 UTC,"If you still had the gas in the tank, id say go pour some octane booster in it if the tank was still rather full, or some premium fuel if there is room in the tank."
BMW,3e3i8x,Sir_not_sir,-1,Tue Jul 21 17:59:38 2015 UTC,"The car says one thing and people tend to go by that.  The dealer tells me that the cars will run fine on lower octane fuel, just with reduced power output.  I run 89 octane for the most part and that seems to work great."

BMW,3dya2u,gamga200,6,Mon Jul 20 14:56:54 2015 UTC,Is that Calypso Red?
BMW,3dya2u,SickFinga,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:47:09 2015 UTC,Yes! I actually have not seen 1 around my area... Not as common as other colours it seems.
BMW,3dya2u,SickFinga,9,Mon Jul 20 15:50:10 2015 UTC,There are only 12 Calypso Red 540i/6 in North America. 3 in the US and 9 in Canada.
BMW,3dya2u,PeteMullersKeyboard,3,Mon Jul 20 15:54:19 2015 UTC,Well there goes my chances.
BMW,3dya2u,sk627,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:21:56 2015 UTC,Holy crap... well that makes this car kind of rare then!
BMW,3dya2u,MakerGrey,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:03:22 2015 UTC,Why do you know that? Haha
BMW,3dya2u,SickFinga,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:10:49 2015 UTC,Where could I find this kind of information about other colors and years?
BMW,3dya2u,dbannon89,0,Mon Jul 20 17:39:21 2015 UTC,"Give me your VIN, so I can get the exact color name and upholstery name, and I'll give you your stats."
BMW,3dya2u,dendrobates_,2,Mon Jul 20 19:37:15 2015 UTC,I have a calypso red e36 vert in the UK. Love the colour! Not many around here in it either.
BMW,3dya2u,navalpain,5,Mon Jul 20 19:33:01 2015 UTC,"saw one cruising around a couple of weeks ago, body was pretty beaten up."
BMW,3dya2u,SickFinga,2,Mon Jul 20 15:46:47 2015 UTC,This one is still rust free! I am lucky.
BMW,3dya2u,navalpain,4,Mon Jul 20 15:50:30 2015 UTC,My dad bought a a 99 5 series in this color while I was growing up. That car sparked my love in BMW. When I turned 23 I bought an E92 in the same color my dad had. Seeing the car again made me feel really happy.
BMW,3dya2u,pcslinger,5,Mon Jul 20 15:53:45 2015 UTC,Calypso Red was discontinued in 1998 and not a single E92 was painted in that color. My guess is that your dad had a Royal Red E39 and you have a Vermillion Red E92.
BMW,3dya2u,liam821,3,Mon Jul 20 16:08:57 2015 UTC,"You know, you are absolutely right, I took a quick glance at the color and kinda just went into my own memories thinking of that car. Yes mine is a Vermillion Red"
BMW,3dya2u,affenjungr,3,Mon Jul 20 17:15:14 2015 UTC,Looks classy. Nice car
BMW,3dya2u,jbmonheim,2,Mon Jul 20 16:02:37 2015 UTC,Thank you!
BMW,3dya2u,Raspy__,3,Mon Jul 20 17:04:00 2015 UTC,"My old e60 M5 was Indy Red, similar to yours.  Very pretty."
BMW,3dya2u,PeteMullersKeyboard,2,Mon Jul 20 16:13:18 2015 UTC,Indy red is very similar to calypso red. I think Indy red has a slightly darker tone under bright light.
BMW,3e1y3b,ELEV8ED,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:33:57 2015 UTC,Not really.  This car has Russian plates and was likely stolen from Germany during or after WW2.
