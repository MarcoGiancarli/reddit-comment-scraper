TeamSolomid,3dreng,EastRicee,7,Sat Jul 18 18:56:58 2015 UTC,He has some good points but he does not know what the environment is actually like. It is all just assumption based.
TeamSolomid,3dreng,llshuxll,7,Sat Jul 18 21:56:10 2015 UTC,"What makes him different from all of us then? None of us actually know what the environment is like but we try to discuss what could be done to fix the problems the team has (when realistically, the chances of anyone on the team reading our input is almost zero)."
TeamSolomid,3dreng,Periodd,7,Sat Jul 18 22:55:13 2015 UTC,The only reason he is different is because he has a voice that people take as fact. Just going to lead some annoying circle jerks in the main sub. Otherwise he knows nothing like us.
TeamSolomid,3dreng,llshuxll,4,Sat Jul 18 23:01:28 2015 UTC,"He doesn't know the whole facts but he knows the scene and CSGO scene and the teams backgrounds much better than any of us. He won't tell them but he is not only a journalist but a long time esports man, he has friends and sources in several teams. And knows some stuff, maybe not specific about tsm but definitely more than we do about all esports teams."
TeamSolomid,3dreng,insanePowerMe,2,Sun Jul 19 12:58:32 2015 UTC,"Thooorin actually has information from team environments and systems, he can't tell anyone about. Yes he won't know much from TSM but he knows way more about overall all teams in the scene and CSGO than any of us. He might not be right, but his assumptions base on more background information than we can have."
TeamSolomid,3dreng,insanePowerMe,-1,Sun Jul 19 12:56:22 2015 UTC,"Just like the Link video, basically."
TeamSolomid,3dreng,myaccount101,7,Sat Jul 18 23:15:54 2015 UTC,"He talks about how Loco doesn't have full control.  Loco said at one point he was taking full control of what champions they are playing and picking for their comps.  I don't know if this happened or not, but if it did and the past few weeks are the result, then it's understandable that Regi is stepping in and having Loco step back.  One thing I noticed was after the first loss with the ez comp, bjergsen argued with Loco about how they aren't thinking of ez properly and he's not azir/kog or something.  Why did this discussion not happen earlier?  Why didn't loco and bjerg talk about ""yo this is how ez works"" so that he knows what Bjerg's opinion is before building the team comp?  He goes on a tirade about how reginald was a terrible shotcaller - This could be true, but from the last episode of TSM legends, he seems to at least have a clear idea on how to improve the team, whereas they have been floundering for the past couple weeks.  I don't really like how he cherry picks things from the past.  Reginald has matured from before, and he had a really sincere apology after he went off on Dyrus on stream.  I don't understand why he keeps saying that Regi is focusing on pick/bans.  Regi specifically said in the last video that they should have won with the picks even if they had worse pick/ban.    Thorin really operates on the hyperbole of the facts that we have."
TeamSolomid,3dreng,akim1026,4,Sun Jul 19 00:23:56 2015 UTC,"Loco wanted Ori, Bjerg overrode with Ez last week. Just as one example."
TeamSolomid,3dreng,peevedlatios,4,Sun Jul 19 01:33:09 2015 UTC,"I dont know if that was a definitive point, however both statements can coexist  It doesnt have to be ""Bjerg lock in ori""  ""Did someone say Ezreal bitch ***locks in ezreal""  It could have been  ""Okay bjerg lets go ori here that good""  ""Actually, I think ezreal will be really good here""  ""I guess that can work""  Probably a very shitty (because im very tired) example, but i think it entirely possible that Bjerg tried to talk him out of ori, and Loco agreed other than outright defiance.  In such a situation Loco could have final say, but weighted player opinion too heavily."
TeamSolomid,3dreng,lurkedlongtime,5,Sun Jul 19 08:08:32 2015 UTC,"Although I truly dislike Thorin and think he is a really obnoxious cunt 99% of the time, I hope very much that Reginald and Loco watch this video.   Thorin talks lots of shit like always, but there are so many good coaching points & coaching tips that I suspect most coaches at the LCS level have not thought of or do not know about & would greatly benefit from listening to. Coaches who are young typically do not have enough life experience or work experience where they have had to learn how to manage people or coach a team to be very effective without much trial and error and time spent learning hard lessons."
TeamSolomid,3dreng,phaneuf_fan_3,-1,Sat Jul 18 23:35:32 2015 UTC,"Loco won't have the time to, as he is about to get cut from TSM and fears for his job. He has to work hard, but Reginald stepping in destroys the last authority Loco had left, Loco is fucked. Reginald won't watch it for the sake of hate Regi, Loco, Monte, Thooorin have for each other."
TeamSolomid,3dsaji,EruisKawaii,10,Sat Jul 18 23:45:53 2015 UTC,"Based on what I've seen, the seeds won't matter. Every team in this league is beatable.  If anything, it might be better to play in quarterfinals to fix mistakes before the semis."
TeamSolomid,3dsaji,Caelestor,3,Sun Jul 19 00:01:28 2015 UTC,"That is a true factor, I guess I'd rather have us start in quarters, but with the results lately I honestly start to worry more and more about TSM's showing. It's not them ""trying new stuff out"" anymore, it's them struggling against NA teams and having every single member not showing. We seriously need to fix this and fast, we can't just say that we'll show up in playoffs anymore."
TeamSolomid,3dsaji,Smedirk,5,Sun Jul 19 00:12:51 2015 UTC,"Talk about being over dramatic man.  ""I'm tired of getting my heart broken and being sad on all of my Saturdays and Sundays."" Beside MSI when was the last time TSM lost three games in a row like come on. Losing streaks happen they're not perfect and will bounce back especially with Regi taking on a bigger role in the coaching."
TeamSolomid,3dsaji,soccrman9,3,Sun Jul 19 00:12:30 2015 UTC,The problem is that they seem to have no idea what to do to fix these problems they keep running into. New issues keep popping up in every game. I'm seriously worried for their chances at getting through playoffs in this state.

TeamSolomid,3dsaji,kyugi0923,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:31:33 2015 UTC,"Nope, at this point 4 teams (CLG,  TIP, Gravity, and TL) can pass TSM in points, since they earned some last split, and TSM is not locked into playoffs yet.  Assuming TSM does get into playoff, that knocks out CLG and gravity leaving only impulse and TL.  If TSM makes it past the first round, only TL can pass them in points.  So TSM really needs TL out the first round if possible to increase their odds."
TeamSolomid,3dsaji,awfulsome,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:18:47 2015 UTC,Didn't TL come in third last split? So doesn't TSM just need to make third place and no one can beat them in circuit points since they'll have a total of 160 points and Team Liquid at most can only get 140 points? If C9 gets second during playoffs they can only tie TSM at best if TSM places third.
TeamSolomid,3dr9zr,Luminancee,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:17:31 2015 UTC,"Unless Regi does pick/ban, it's wasted effort.  5 AP comp today.  Under no circumstances is that acceptable."
TeamSolomid,3dr9zr,Geofferic,-1,Sun Jul 19 03:22:48 2015 UTC,Regi is undoubtedly going to come in and make a big impact but not for all the right reasons. He will come in with much more authority than loco ever had. Meaning in a situation that Bjerg whines that ez is a good pick here Regi will be able to slap him down and say no you are playing this pick for this reason deal with it.
TeamSolomid,3dr9zr,APCookie,3,Sat Jul 18 18:47:28 2015 UTC,"Healthy discussion is good in a team. Blindly following a coach is counter intuitive in a game like League of Legends where the players have to think for themselves in game. Bjergsen voicing his opinion was not an act of defiance - even Regi touches on this in one of his messages to the community, saying that Bjerg is the most vocal one of the group and will not hesitate to put in his two cents when he feels it necessary. Having read Regi's responses I highly doubt he'll be an authoritative, dictator-esque leader. He merely wants to foster an environment where all of the members of the team can express their concerns effectively and consequently learn from their mistakes."
TeamSolomid,3dr9zr,nkini123,-2,Sat Jul 18 19:56:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah that would be all fine and good, except Regi is a dick and it won't come across well"

TeamSolomid,3dnjeg,manslayer22,24,Fri Jul 17 18:43:11 2015 UTC,Damn. Reginald impressed me this episode.
TeamSolomid,3dnjeg,codedapple,53,Fri Jul 17 19:12:33 2015 UTC,This is the epitome of why Reginald is the best owner any team could possibly ask for.
TeamSolomid,3dnjeg,apdermond,17,Fri Jul 17 19:06:04 2015 UTC,"I think Regi becoming more involved was the best possible thing that could've happened. No roster change was going to fix all our issues, but bringing in someone who the team trusts and respects like Regi just might."
TeamSolomid,3dnjeg,Alyssum,7,Fri Jul 17 21:01:23 2015 UTC,"Agreed. You can just see how different the team reacts when Regi talks. The amount of respect the players and even Loco give him shows perfectly in this episode. Everything he says, you can tell they are really listening and taking it to heart, and I don't blame them. I will never understand the hate Reginald receives. As somebody a few years older than Regi, I hope I can accomplish half the things he has been able to. Regi is the reason I root for TSM, and he is the reason I will continue to do so forever.   If by some miracle he happen to read this, I think I speak for most TSM fans when I say thanks Regi for just being you."
TeamSolomid,3dnjeg,apdermond,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:56:29 2015 UTC,"I have massive respect for Regi as an owner. he knows that his team has the individual skills to compete, but they need to work together far more cohesively than they have. He knows that Bjerg is the best mechanically but that does not give him the right to override the team agenda. Ever since he stepped down as a player, Regi has made great decisions for the team."
TeamSolomid,3dnjeg,kingofallryans34,13,Sat Jul 18 05:27:14 2015 UTC,"From what I can speculate, as a shotcaller, Bjergsen lacks the confidence to make calls and do things by himself. As a shotcaller you need to be somewhat stubborn when you know your calls are right, and he definitely has that stubbornness, we've all seen that. However when they were discussing the first game's second dragon, bjergsen said that, ""I asked if  you guys wanted me to stay and you guys said I could back when I could've stayed."" As the shotcaller, you need to know that you have to stay. You don't ask your teammates whether or not you want them to stay. If there's an objective, you stay and you tell them to group. Because of his wishy washy-ness in his decision making, they lack a decisive voice (which Regi stated).  Their team fighting is sloppy as hell as well. I remember they used to have some pretty good team fighting. I think in season 3 they were almost known to force team fights in order to win. In season 4, their team fight was pretty good. Not amazing, not bad. And now, it's just abysmal. I'm not sure whether it has to do with synergy or shotcalling but something needs to change. It's a collective failure atm for the organization. I'm hoping they'll bounce back up and get their heads straight for playoffs.   edit: also, leena is gorgeous"

TeamSolomid,3dnjeg,Zellough,5,Sat Jul 18 02:48:04 2015 UTC,Slightly interesting to me that Keith wasn't in this episode at all (iirc). I wonder if Regi will agree with my thinking that they need to pick an ADC and stick with it over swapping people out in scrims.
TeamSolomid,3dnjeg,apdermond,8,Fri Jul 17 22:46:01 2015 UTC,"I think Keith did his job, WT seems to be stepping up and playing better every week. Hopefully he keeps this up until he can get back to his old form."
TeamSolomid,3dnjeg,Matanza,31,Fri Jul 17 23:02:09 2015 UTC,"Man, I have never thought poorly about Bjergsen since he came over.  Never cared too much about his stream antics and constant blaming etc, but his attitude ever since Spring Split has really been quite annoying. And for some reason he has to disagree about picks EVERY time, like how can they not agree on mid lane picks almost 3 full seasons(I think?) in with Loco. And Bjergsen even says they were only going to engage on him etc, when Turtle was actually the one who TL probably wanted to kill most.  I know I'll probably get downvoted to hell but man the way Bjergsen has been progressing as a teammate/and player/coach relationship just doesn't seem healthy, I dont know.  EDIT: By seasons I meant splits***"

Excited to see Regi in a bigger role though."
TeamSolomid,3dnjeg,Habachi44,3,Fri Jul 17 20:02:32 2015 UTC,"I am so glad that Regi cracks down on this. I have been here saying that its not individual players but pickbans/strategy/practice patterns (i.e.: coaching) that was the issue. Some of you agreed with me, but many still don't want to see that Loco is having a bad effect right now.  This is nothing new. It has been going very wrong at least since MSI. TSM either need to expand the coaching staff, or replace Loco."
TeamSolomid,3dnjeg,Roflkopt3r,8,Fri Jul 17 23:05:42 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think it has nothing to do w/ Bjerg's attitude towards the team, but rather trying too hard to do too much w/ the team. His mentality results in a lack of trust in his teammates to carry him and make the calls that don't involve him being in the center of it.   This kind of mentality can have a toll on him and force him to do things that are uncharacteristic. Remember in S4 Summer Split, where Bjerg trusted his coaching staff and players to make the right calls/plays. I think that since MSI, he's felt as if he needs to do more, but it's negatively affecting the team. This is kinda what happened with Regi where he had so many responsibilities in-game and out of game.   I think Regi's frankness with the team will create hunger in the organization. I think people will really be motivated instead of just talking. Regi is a natural and charismatic leader no doubt.   TLDR; Bjerg's problems come from him trying to do too much for the team (sorta like Regi when he was shotcalling). Lack of trust as a result of MSI impacted his mindset for this split alone. Regi will bring him back down to Earth."

TeamSolomid,3dnjeg,Habachi44,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:29:35 2015 UTC,And yet it already seems like he is not well suited to be a coach long term. Of course it can work for a while if he understood a certain meta well and still knew the strategies since he used to be a pro player.   But what does he really know about coaching? Is he really one who can create good training patterns for the team? Is he really able to keep up with the meta now that he isn't a player anymore? Why can't he get good pick/bans anymore?  More questions than benefits.
TeamSolomid,3dnjeg,Roflkopt3r,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:00:38 2015 UTC,"I had the same thoughts about Picks/Bans. It's one thing to analyse the game. However, without actually playing, he'll have no idea who to actually pick or ban. Theory is one thing, execution is another. If we had to be honest, Locodoco did really great things for TSM during his first split to worlds. He did a stellar job. However, kinda like Lustboy, now he's not doing so hot. I'm not sure whether it has to do with players not respecting him enough or his coaching is deteriorating but if Reginald (the man who owns the team and has done everything to benefit the team) thinks that Locodoco is still trying to improve, I say we cut him some slack for the time being. Plus Regi's coming in to help them all. j"

TeamSolomid,3dnjeg,Zellough,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:48:51 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. My worry is that he'll take this too hard and leave and Lustboy will leave with him. I think TSM need to think about rebuilding around Bjergsen next split. I know Dyrus wants to retire, so it may be a good time to pick up a reputable top laner.   My dream team would be:  Flame Santorin (yes he would stay) Bjergsen Freeze  / WT (WT wouldn't be an issue if he can play workhorse style adc who just cleans up due to the combo of Flame + Bjergsen) Lustboy  Metas change, however. Top lane won't always be carry oriented, so it's a curious debacle as to who will replace Dyrus after he retires after a long, successful career."

It's clear a lot of people saw the video and came away with the same conclusion, that Bjergsen was being combative. It's easy to ascribe wins to Loco and losses to disunity, when those are the most apparent and obvious things to look at. Again, it's nice to be given a view of the inside, so that we see a bit more clearly what is really the issue, and why that issue might make it seem like something else to an outsider.    It's also interesting that Regi wants the team in general to speak up, but also for Bjergsen in particular to be a certain way. I imagine he wants a more Hai-like presence in the mid-lane: someone who remains positive because they know the way out in any situation. Someone who can rally the troops instead of being crushed under the weight of a gold gap."

TeamSolomid,3dpnj7,apdermond,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:49:53 2015 UTC,"Even if this game doesn't end up in TSM's favor, you can't say that they are just sitting around doing nothing this week and slowly losing. They're attempting to make plays. It isn't always working but the attempt is finally there again. The success will come; it won't if they never try."
TeamSolomid,3dpnj7,katnizz,2,Sat Jul 18 20:46:24 2015 UTC,"Looking at TSM's current state right now, I am not optimistic enough to ask for a 2-0 this week, especially against TIP. With the way DIG played in the past 2 weeks, TSM should be able to beat them.    The game against TIP, Ryze should be banned. Not sure about Kalista, since it doesn't seem like TIP prioritize her.  Since TIP is on blue side, I think Sivir, Rumble, and Nidalee should be banned against them. Giving TIP Sivir is like asking to lose teamfights, especially with how underwhelming TSM has been in teamfights lately. Rumble should not be given to TIP for similar reasons, and he's pretty damn strong right now. Rush puts too much pressure with Nidalee, but he also does with Lee. Another possible strategy TSM could go for is to ban Lee, Nidalee, and Evelyn, the 3 junglers that Rush is comfortable with. Give up a power pick (Sivir for example), but TSM can get 2 power picks in return (Alista/Rumble for example), and forces Rush to go with a jungler that he can't make crazy early game plays on. Or maybe if they are prepared to play against Evenlyn, they can do something like  ban Lee, Nid, and Sivir/Ryze."
TeamSolomid,3dpnj7,EastRicee,2,Sat Jul 18 07:01:07 2015 UTC,This will be a good week for TSM's coaching staff to step-up and show us all why they are the best in NA
TeamSolomid,3dpnj7,OhThrowed,2,Sat Jul 18 07:04:17 2015 UTC,"Honestly, all I want to see is a solid draft."
TeamSolomid,3dpnj7,Only1nDreams,2,Sat Jul 18 15:27:56 2015 UTC,"Bjergsen on Ahri   biggest one today. Bjergsen needs to be on a playmaker with the ability to impact the game from the first minute. XWX has a history of making risky plays, and Bjerg will for sure be able to punish them. CLG has put Pobelter on poke champs for the majority of games this split, if they early pick Ahri, it might push POB onto something pick-based like TF which could lead to a comp that has caused CLG to underperform, at least this split.   Santorin on RekSai   Santorin has made some mechanical mistakes the last few weeks. There's no skirting around it, he's fucked up. I think defaulting him back to Gragas is a mistake. As RekSai he can help Bjerg set up picks a lot more simply, and there's a much smaller margin for error. Putting him on a simple champ and letting him regain some confidence would be good for him going forward.   Dyrus on Gnar   Dyrone's best performances this split have been on Rumble and Gnar. By far. Rumble is insanely strong this patch, so I can't really see it getting through bans. Even if it does, a triple threat comp doesn't really fit TSM's style of looking for big mid game fights that swing the whole game. Dyrus' Gnar has been super consistent and would fit well Ahri and RekSai.   Lustboy on Nautilus   Rounding out the comp with a tanky support. Lustboy's Nautilus has been really good historically, and it gives him the lane pressure to babysit Turtle until midgame. If they put Turtle on a immobile champ, could maybe be subbed for Thresh for the lantern reposition.    Turtle on Tristana    In this meta, I think Trist is Turtle's best option. Though Trist is currently a shade of her former S4 playoffs/world stomping self, having self peel and rocket jump gives Turtle a lot of freedom to make plays."
TeamSolomid,3dpnj7,phaneuf_fan_3,2,Sat Jul 18 20:20:45 2015 UTC,Turtle just go ahead and find your way to the fkn bench...I dont even understand how at this point it isn't obvious that Keith should get a legitimate shot at the adc role. You can only hide turtle's retarded plays for so long. Every week on TSM Legends you can literally every fucking game you can see Loco/Parth right before the match say DONT FLASH IN. Doesn't matter.

TeamSolomid,3dnrmv,thedarkjack,2,Fri Jul 17 19:48:26 2015 UTC,i think he broke up with his Girlfriend. i feel regi may have forced him to do it so he can focus on league but that my guess. if you look at her twitter she seem upset as well.
TeamSolomid,3dnrmv,EnragedPyro,3,Sat Jul 18 01:22:06 2015 UTC,Tbh probably not he said he said life is crazy in a way like its amazing which is probably why people think his gf got pregnant. Keith also seemed to know because he asked why is he teasing us so it's probably something personal his team mates know. Bjergdaddy confirmed

TeamSolomid,3dprbd,RagingFeather,5,Sat Jul 18 06:49:21 2015 UTC,Maybe his body is more susceptible to injuries because if I remember correctly he used to play football a lot and when he got injured he resorted to league to feed his competitive drive.

TSM Freeze won't happen. TSM Pilot won't happen. TSM Keith is going to happen, he's incredibly talented and has an insanely high skill ceiling.

TeamSolomid,3dp2q0,JaysusMoon,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:53:41 2015 UTC,He has the potential. In his game against TDK Bjergsen carried. So we have to see. But at this moment Turtle is the better pick by far
TeamSolomid,3dp2q0,MiniiNinja,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:28:45 2015 UTC,In his game against TDK he was pretty much camped  There's a lot of shit going wrong with TSM's playstyle at the moment that we can't pin on either Turtle or Keith. I agree Turtle's definitely the better pick at the moment but I'm also excited to see where Keith can be when Turtle decides to retire

TeamSolomid,3dl1md,myaccount101,24,Fri Jul 17 03:19:55 2015 UTC,"I think TSM needs to work on all aspects of the game, honestly."
TeamSolomid,3dl1md,beaniebees,8,Fri Jul 17 03:35:11 2015 UTC,"Yep.  To me this is clearly a coaching issue. There is no point at all in criticising the individual players right now when the entire team is the issue. And to me there are two solutions:   Get a sports psychologist or assistant coach who knows about training theory to get TSMs practice schedule and pattern back in line, because Loco appears to try to make up for his own mistakes (pick/bans, strategies) with a ridiculous scrim overload. Replace Locodoco.   Oh and if you are interested in strategy, compare TSM's AP Ez games to those of EDG in Demacia cup and todays LPL. Remember how TSM lost pressure and got chocked out due to AP Ez pick? EDG just sends 2-4 people to roam mid lane and suddenly they are the ones having pressure."
TeamSolomid,3dl1md,Roflkopt3r,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:06:26 2015 UTC,"i think tsm being the no 1 team in NA should had gotten a psychologist a long time ago, every member of the team seems to have personality problems that affect the results of the team, including locodoco, so regi plz invest in this improve in your infraestructure and get your team an esports psychologist"
TeamSolomid,3dl1md,Rebodka,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:50:08 2015 UTC,"I don't even think it's personality problems, to me it looks like Locodoco doesn't know how to deal with tough times.  Of course I am just an outsider who only gets glimpses into TSM by what material they publish to us. But the impression I got is that Loco's coaching did not work out long term, that he could not keep up with the changes in meta and strategy, and then burdened this problems that originated from his failures onto the players and forced them into a far overdone training regimen.  I do think that a psychologist who knows about training theory and training efficiency could help a lot with that."
TeamSolomid,3dl1md,Roflkopt3r,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:53:51 2015 UTC,"I kinda agree with u on the issue that loco has put some of his burden into the players than to himself, but that's exactly what a psychologist can easyly fix. He could also help bjerg with his kinda ego problem (always bringin up problems that councern him), could help lustboy to open himself up to the team more and overall make the team more confident in themself wich i think is critcal in making league of legends calls, most of the time they know what they have to do but can't speak up to say it ( like dyrus calling for ganks or whatnot)"
TeamSolomid,3dl1md,Rebodka,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:59:49 2015 UTC,Jungle issue TSM has never had a jungler whit this low pressure Santorin literally has no pressure in the early game. He hasnt ganked in like 10 games. In teamfights he runs away with 70 % hp and without using ult.
TeamSolomid,3dl1md,Vzuper,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:38:48 2015 UTC,"These are strategical problems. Jungler pathing and pressure is one of the core elements of a teams early-game strategy. So either the strategical planning is bad, or Santorin has screwed up so hard for so long that he should have been replaced weeks ago without discussion. Looks to me like it is more of a strategical issue than one of individual decisionmaking."
TeamSolomid,3dl1md,Roflkopt3r,0,Sat Jul 18 07:58:29 2015 UTC,I think every Fnatic fan wants Locodoco gone.
TeamSolomid,3dl1md,Maffajew,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:04:31 2015 UTC,I actually think thats the problem. I think Loco has identified all the areas where we can improve but instead of staggering the changes he's maybe hit them with them all at the same time.
TeamSolomid,3dl1md,Helian7,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:02:53 2015 UTC,Yup. He's tried to change too many things at once. 'Baby steps into huge strides' - Baby Steps the Animu. He tries to micromanage them too hard as well.
TeamSolomid,3dl1md,Periodd,6,Fri Jul 17 17:32:47 2015 UTC,What I'm curious about is if he's talking about playing against Turtle in scrims or solo q. If TSM lets Turtle play both games this week then I think they will keep him until at least by the end of this season.
TeamSolomid,3dl1md,katnizz,8,Fri Jul 17 03:32:29 2015 UTC,Scrims he said.
TeamSolomid,3dl1md,ljosquaredl,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:35:51 2015 UTC,How are TSM doing in scrims anyways?
TeamSolomid,3dl1md,katnizz,3,Fri Jul 17 05:30:34 2015 UTC,"I haven't heard anything about scrim results, but if assuming that TSM scrims with C9 and Sneaky didn't mention anything about TSM being strong in scrims, I'd say that they aren't doing too hot either."

TeamSolomid,3dl1md,katnizz,7,Fri Jul 17 06:29:06 2015 UTC,"No, he specifically said he doesn't think WT is the problem because he played well last week, and that WT is clearly better than keith. He never said ""probably"", he straight out called WildTurtle better without hesitating for a second, and said WildTurtle is better mechanically, in team fights, and puts more pressure mid and late."
TeamSolomid,3dl1md,lehnugget,2,Fri Jul 17 04:28:44 2015 UTC,"Yes I did, no one denied that he has underperformed this split."
TeamSolomid,3dl1md,Kilithaza,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:34:53 2015 UTC,"Correct, he said that Turtle > Keith. He then said that Turtle dropping was one of the problems, but he also said that that Turtle isn't the core problems since he did well last week and they went 0-2."

TeamSolomid,3diq21,Threemor,3,Thu Jul 16 17:40:59 2015 UTC,"Depends on what they would do in that situation. I'd imagine most teams they didn't make it would go on vacation for a bit.

TeamSolomid,3dgflf,katnizz,11,Thu Jul 16 01:56:27 2015 UTC,"Im hoping you mean Reksai, not Khazix. Because Kha isnt in the meta right now at all.  That said.  Things to be excited about  5.13 makes rumble insanely good. We could get Dyrus priority on rumble, normally i would be scared as of late since s4 worlds his rumble had looked a lot worse, but... its been looking good lately (particularly vs TDK and CLG)  I dont think this kills the current jg meta tho. Maybe im wrong, but I just dont know how many teams are going to be able to realistically be able to play with devourer in competitive.  Devourer quite frankly sucks in scrimishes/team fights compared to warrior or cinder hulk before its sated.  It will probably take in a competitive environment ~22-24 mins for such power spike.  If the other team plays agressive, I dont see how you can even stay in the game for 22-24 mins for that power spike, which isnt even that strong unless you build MORE damage which is just not strong in competitve, competitve junglers do not have the gold income to build damage.  Bjergsen on the streams i have watched seems VERY receptive to the new patch and is trying all sorts of new things to experiment and new champions.  Bad parts:  More possibilities could open up new picks, new picks = possible cheese and we all know how TSM performs against that.   Priority on rumble sky rocketing could be troublesome. TSM hates playing against rumble, and have a very high ban rate on banning rumble against teams they are afraid of that can play rumble (i guess an exemption would be them leaving up rumble vs c9 this year)"
TeamSolomid,3dgflf,lurkedlongtime,2,Thu Jul 16 02:28:14 2015 UTC,"Good post. Yes I meant Rek'sai, thanks for that.  I agree with you about Sated Devourer will have a tough spot in competitive. The only champion I think can use it in competitive is Nocturne, but not sure if people would want to sacrifice the Warrior spike. Kayle and Shyvana are also possible, but iffy.   Yeah TSM used to perma ban Rumble for a while, but if Bjergsen can learn Rumble mid (if Rumble mid is a thing), then I think TSM should be able to first pick him Blue side.   Overall, I'm excited and hopefully that TSM will adapt well."
TeamSolomid,3dgflf,KitKatxz,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:37:03 2015 UTC,"Actuaclly Shyvana is pretty good with sated, she built the item orginal before and is already a good duelist in the early game, plus once it gets sated and she has botrk. Oh god the damage is insane. You're mostly right though if you don't snowball sated becomes useless as hell, due to most stacks come from objectives that need to be fought for."
TeamSolomid,3dgflf,gahlo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:02:49 2015 UTC,"She's crazy in solo q, but I don't know she can make it in competitive with such little cc and gap closing."
TeamSolomid,3dgflf,Rossingol,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:46:04 2015 UTC,"The great thing about actually playing on a team is that you can pair junglers that have 0 cc with cc heavy laners, like maokai, pretty reliably."

TeamSolomid,3dgflf,Zellough,2,Thu Jul 16 14:58:45 2015 UTC,"If anything there is a chance of improvement. Maybe Loco can find a new basis in a new meta instead of continuing his current confusion.  But if it gets worse, TSM should look for a new coach instead of questioning the individual players. It is the connecting element of practice patterns, strategy, and pick bans that is the issue, not individual performance - i.e  the coaching."
TeamSolomid,3dgflf,phaneuf_fan_3,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:52:22 2015 UTC,"Should be way better than last patch, hopefully we'll see Santorin playing with more freedom, maybe start applying pressure  But more than anything, this new patch is like a fresh new slate for teams, this should give TSM the breather they need to start running for the playoffs"
TeamSolomid,3dgflf,Rebodka,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:09:03 2015 UTC,"I think they will do better, mostly because I think AP mids got buffed quite a bit from some of the AP item changes and it will only help Bjerg more. Especially if he can begin going back on assassin type champs."

TeamSolomid,3dgflf,kidocosmic,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:54:25 2015 UTC,"Since TSM is red side on both games, I think they will definitely ban Rumble, especially against TIP. Like you said, Rumble is very strong this patch, and TSM is not good playing against Rumble."

TeamSolomid,3dg51d,EruisKawaii,10,Thu Jul 16 00:28:20 2015 UTC,if the team can master the basics like building MR vs a 4 AP team comp by playoff time i think they will be ok

I really hope TIP beats TSM, they are definitely much better. It is also always exciting to watch them play as they are always trying to make plays.

I imagine with Dyrus retiring,  we may pick up an elite top laner form Korea. I also think Sneaky may be an option should C9 crash and burn. Other than  the adc issues, I don't even think TSM's  current roster is bad by any means, but the coordination, especially around objectives has been so poor."

TeamSolomid,3dg51d,PumaConnection,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:31:28 2015 UTC,"I'm not exactly sure how you can be confident that TSM can destroy Gravity and Liquid in a bo5. Nothing they have shown this split can back up that claim. If anything, it would be the other way around. Whether or not they make it to worlds is one thing, but they are definitely now world contenders at the level in which they are playing at. No one on their team right now has been showing any dominance in their role. Bot lane is usually down cs at 20 mins, jungler has absolutely no presence (if you want to tell me otherwise, go watch LCK/EU/LPL/any NA game besides TSM, and then come back and talk to me), Dyrus is well Dyrus (nothing special here) and Bjergsen just stays even on cs.      They make literally no plays in their game and win off of waiting for the other teams to make mistakes in the late game. With that mentality in worlds, they will get, for lack of a better word, get sh*t on. They'll be playing reactive to all of the plays the enemy makes and while the enemy's jungle is off ganking every lane, TSM has their wonderful jungle hibernating in their very own forest.     For just a brief comparison, look at SKT vs Koo Tigers game yesterday. That was a match between the top two teams in Korea right now and look at how SKT dismantled them. I'm not asking for that same level of dominance from TSM but when a team like TSM can barely manage to pick up a win against TDK (the last place team in the worst region of the world with a record of 1-13, giving them possibly their only win of the split), it doesn't bode too well for them."

TeamSolomid,3dbvou,Marco_Brolo_,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:19:53 2015 UTC,Impulse definitely looked better than TSM in the recent 2 weeks. Their next game will arguably be the most important game out of all the remaining games in term of standings.
TeamSolomid,3dbvou,katnizz,2,Wed Jul 15 07:36:32 2015 UTC,"I really hope TSM can step it up, it's time to let Turtle have full scrim time because he's clearly the one to ADC, even if Keith does better than him, on international stage we all know it's Turtle. The team needs full time scrim with 5 man and needs to build up an identity that can lead them to consistent play and victories. I know they are trying new stuff out and they will show up for playoffs but lately there seems to be SO many problems that we can only hope and think that they will fix them. On the other note, winning the last 4 games would be huge since we do want a playoff bye if possible, otherwise if we don't get it, we'll do fine in playoffs anyway but that might give Liquid or some other team guarantee more champion points. We also want to make sure our drafting is always consistent because we all know it fell hard during MSI where we prioritized very bad picks such as Cho'Gath and Ziggs when we should have got more carry damage for Bjergsen."

BUT i mean its not like Turtle looked that great (in fact he actually looked poor) the day after against GV.  However, Turtle looked a lot better against TL this week, hopefully a return to form? Though it was a good comp to protect him too."
TeamSolomid,3dbvou,lurkedlongtime,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:41:47 2015 UTC,"I don't think he looked bad at all, especially considering how nervous he was. He got first blooded which could've been fixed by calling Santorin pressure, but otherwise he only died in teamfights due to being focused and less on being ""frontline"" like Turtle. He basically just did his job but didn't do anything spectacular. I mean, he was on sivir."

TeamSolomid,3dbvou,Johnsu,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:36:28 2015 UTC,"As an esports ""athlete"" he is payed to perform on command. I'm not saying he's an utter scrub that doesn't deserve to be on the team. I'm just saying he had a bad game, which he did, and TSM isn't in a position like last split where they can freely try things out.  Does he deserve another chance in the future? If Turtle's play would warrant it, surely. It's just that now isn't the time."
TeamSolomid,3dbvou,gahlo,0,Wed Jul 15 19:15:05 2015 UTC,"I don't see the Turtle/Keith difference matter at all, TSMs problems are NOT at an individual player level. The issue is with practice patterns, strategy, and pick/bans - i.e. Loco's responsibility."

TeamSolomid,3d934p,Luminancee,2,Tue Jul 14 13:35:24 2015 UTC,"For those wondering:  EnVyUs is currently under a lot of scrutiny. From winning Gfinity to losing (or for politically correct terms: getting shitted on in) two BO3s in LAN against Cloud9, it is rumored that EnVyUs is about to go into a roster change. They are rumored to get rid of Shox + SmithzZzz because they are best friends and essentially a package-deal for to any other French team. If teams would want one, they would need to make room for the other, which can cause another French Shuffle like what we saw with the fall of Titan last year.  EDIT: It seems like EnVyUs is set to get kennyS and apEX in replacement to Shox and SmithzZz. This brings a decent upgrade in AWPing, as kennyS is arguably one of the best AWPers in the world (personally I believe GuardiaN is the best), and a decent entry fragger that has worked with Happy before."

TeamSolomid,3d53if,theBigGloom,8,Mon Jul 13 17:10:32 2015 UTC,"yeah, lol. that game was TL's when Piglet got the steal."
TeamSolomid,3d53if,apdermond,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:12:00 2015 UTC,"Maybe, but let's suppose TSM got it. The game wouldn't have ended during the baron buff. TL would've started winning teamfights due to Dyrus build vs Azir/Corki. The baron was a missplay but I don't see it as the cause to lose the game."
TeamSolomid,3d53if,llshuxll,9,Mon Jul 13 18:16:57 2015 UTC,"To be fair, TSM had quite a good comp for both diving and taking turrets. With the gold advantage that they were likely to get with the baron buff, Dyrus' build would have been less of an issue, even if it was still bad. At worst, it would have made the game a lot longer than it ended up being, and TSM had a monstrous late game comp.  Obviously, talking about what-ifs is a waste of time, but we shouldn't understate the importance of that baron steal."
TeamSolomid,3d53if,apdermond,10,Mon Jul 13 18:55:49 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I think Turtle has played a lot better these last few weeks and TSM is struggling with different problems. To be honest, TSM has looked uncoordinated lately and I don't think bringing in Keith is the solution. There also seems to be some major issues with Locodoco and drafting, although apparently it's all just ""TSM trying out new strategies."" Additionally, Santorin is playing like he forgot how to pressure lanes for the first 20 minutes of every game.   Im not ALL that worried right now and I think we will pull together for playoffs, but there is definitely some problems right now and from my perspective it has nothing to do with the ADC."
TeamSolomid,3d53if,llshuxll,3,Mon Jul 13 16:46:32 2015 UTC,"My point exactly. TSM as an org has been very good solving problems (see our CS:GO team). From a management perspective, TSM has the experience and the tools to redirect the team. Maybe Regi needs to spend more time in the team and identify the core problems (I believe Regi's team management perspective to be one of the best in the scene). Hopefully they will solve the team issues.   Some other thing we have to consider is that we only need to get a good place in the playoffs and we might have the points to attend worlds."
TeamSolomid,3d53if,apdermond,-5,Mon Jul 13 18:24:32 2015 UTC,"Even though I think Keith is a great player, I think bringing Keith in has actually hurt them. Splitting scrims with another person can't help with chemistry or the communication issues they have so frequently cited as being a huge problem.  I get that Turtle has had a problem with his aggression. This has always been a weakness. It has, however, also always been his strength. This aggressiveness and willing to take risks is what TSM has been missing these past few weeks. Rather than trying to harness his aggressiveness, limit it to less risky plays, they have chosen to make him play passively, both with directly telling him to play this way and by bringing in Keith which has to scare Turtle as much as it motivates him. I can't imagine the pressure of playing in LCS, let alone the pressure of playing in LCS with a potential replacement hanging over your head.  They should've just replaced Turtle or not have tried out Keith at all at this stage. I view it as more harm than good."
TeamSolomid,3d53if,grotesquejak,4,Mon Jul 13 17:14:00 2015 UTC,"Bringing in Keith did not hurt them. Turtle has performed better since his arrival. The shot calling, team play, and horrible vision/objective control plus simple mechanics(using point and click abilities, also itemization) are why TSM is losing and was there before Keith joined. Dont use Keith as a scapegoat......"
TeamSolomid,3d53if,apdermond,-1,Mon Jul 13 17:22:21 2015 UTC,I'm not using Keith as a scapegoat at all. It has nothing to do with Keith himself. I'm saying that bringing in Keith to split scrims isn't beneficial to the team regardless of the impact it has on Turtle. They have said countless times about how big of an issue communication is for them.  A better way to phrase this is saying that they sacrificed the team in order to just improve Turtle.
TeamSolomid,3d53if,llshuxll,4,Mon Jul 13 17:44:15 2015 UTC,"But they didnt. Their problems EXISTED WAY BEFORE Keith was brought on. Buddy, come on. Can you atleast think before you post. I feel like I am in CLG's sub with this rampant stupidity."
TeamSolomid,3d53if,apdermond,0,Mon Jul 13 18:05:12 2015 UTC,Are you even reading my posts? Don't really understand personal attacks in a sub where we are all the fan of the same team and all want to see them succeed.  When did I say they started once Keith got here? I said the problems aren't being fixed because they are swapping players. Those issues are harder to fix when you are swapping guys in and out in scrims. I am saying this is counter productive to try and fix them.  Can you at least think before you post baseless accusations against people whose opinions you disagree with? Fucking pathetic.
TeamSolomid,3d53if,wilfordbrimley7,3,Mon Jul 13 18:38:38 2015 UTC,You have a good point. I don't see why ur being attacked/downvoted.
TeamSolomid,3d53if,apdermond,2,Tue Jul 14 13:02:08 2015 UTC,I appreciate it.
TeamSolomid,3d53if,llshuxll,-1,Tue Jul 14 13:30:07 2015 UTC,"Yes, I have read your posts and it hurts me. I am not trying to ""attack you"" but your logic is based on the fact that bringing in a new person hampers an entire teams game plan and commuincation. Yet, your whole arguement is destroyed by the fact that you can plug and play any player unless that person was a shotcaller or is just plain awful at the game. Keith/Turtle are not shot callers so they have very little impact to a team besides their level of play. This swap is no way affects scrims or is counter productive because their problems do not lay soley in bot lane. They have problems with engages, early game pressure, vision control, and wave management/rotations. Now do you understand why I am frustrated with you shitty ""opinion."" You focus way to much on Keith swapping but miss the entire point that it does not affect scrims and the problems have been there since MSI and have not been solved. It is something else in how they scrim, see the game, or are being coached."
TeamSolomid,3d53if,apdermond,0,Mon Jul 13 19:30:19 2015 UTC,"And my point is that when Keith comes in and plays in scrims, they are having to work more on allowing him to adjust to the team and less focusing on fixing the plethora of issues you just stated.  Bringing in a new player forces you to get them acclimated, it forces you to learn their play style, it forces you to listen to things they say and interpret them in a variety of ways. When you continually rotate players in scrims, it makes practice less efficient. It doesn't allow them to fully focus on fixing the issues they have.   Not everybody who disagrees with you has shitty opinions. You need to learn better tact and accept that not everybody thinks the way you do, and that is okay. You have Keith flair, I can only assume you're rooting for him to take over as ADC. That may cause some bias, I don't know. Know that I am not a Turtle fan. I am a TSM fan. I don't root for players. I want want the best TSM possible even if it meant a brand new 5 people coming in. I root for the brand because I love Regi."

If you want to continue then please tell me why my points are wrong."
TeamSolomid,3d53if,gws,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:28:06 2015 UTC,"Wall of text alert!  I actually gave you a bunch of reasons in the first two paragraphs why bringing in a new player hurts a team dynamic and their ability to improve on teamwide issues. You, however, responded to none of specific points about how this hinders teamwide improvement and instead decided to say I repeated myself.  Since you apparently need me to address them point by point, no, you can't just plug and play anybody. That's why excellent players haven't worked going to new teams (see: Reckles, Forg1ven, to a lesser extent Incarnat1on, and plenty more). It takes A LOT of work to incorporate a new player into a team. Sometimes there is a honeymoon phase where things work perfectly, other times there isn't. That doesn't change the difficulty in changing up a roster, especially a long standing one like TSM has.  All of the reasons I stated in my last post are reasons why bringing Keith in has hurt their ability to work on the team issues that you listed, none of which you responded to. Just swapping in another player makes it so that both Keith or WT have less time to contribute improving those flaw areas. Just because neither is the primary shot caller, doesn't mean they sit there and take orders and feed information all game. They have an impact on the calls that are made due to the decisions that they make in game. They have an impact on engages, rotations, wave management, etc. To imply that you can plug and play anybody is so incredibly naive, and, to be frank, insulting to both Keith and WT that their job is so easy as long as you have high mechanical skills.  Do the problems solely lay with bot lane? Nope, never said they did. But ADC is 20% of the team. To reiterate, they have a huge impact in all of the things you listed i.e. engages, rotation, wave management, etc. Keith and WT are two different players. Even if they have similarities and are close in skill, everything they do is unique to them. To imply that you can just swap them out and work on the issues at the same time is just false. It hinders this ability as if you cover something once, you only did it with a specific group of 5. What happens the next time and the other player is there? Even if he was standing there watching, it's still a different person. I've listed countless reasons why it hurts their scrims and their ability to work on team issues. All you've done is tell me that I'm wrong without any sort of reason why other than because you think it is.  I agree completely that there is something wrong in how they scrim, see the game, or are being coached. That doesn't mean, however, that splitting scrims between two players does not hurt improving in those areas."

TeamSolomid,3d53if,jtheq,2,Mon Jul 13 20:26:44 2015 UTC,"Finally, another person who shares my thoughts on Lustboy's performance. Compared to Pre-MSI, he's been playing like a totally different person. If you showed me vods of spring split and vods from this split that did not have summoner names on top of the support champs, I would NOT know who the hell was playing because I would think it's two different people. Perhaps Lustboy has gotten complacent since winning a split or something. He needs to pick up his slack.   Santorin needs to apply more pressure, but he needs his laners to tell him all the information he needs to gank and he needs them to call for jungle pressure (which apparently they aren't?).   Wildturtle's slowly getting better. As long as he doesn't get complacent and under-perform consistently, we should be fine. However if the team wants to win, he'll have to play like yesterday.   Bjergsen is Bjergsen.   Dyrus needs to keep his head on straight during games cause yesterday wasn't good.   Locodoco/Coaching staff needs to step up their game. The Shen support is probably not what lustboy wanted to play. The ezreal that bjergsen had to play wasn't the best pick for most of the prior games as well.  Wildturtle is not the problem. It's an organizational problem and it needs to be fixed. The game yesterday would've been won if we got that Baron but w/e that's yesterday's game so screw it. If the boys really wanna win worlds, they all gotta step up. Like that one korean announcer said for the msi trailer for what defines a championship team: ""If teams are really passionate, that's not enough. If the team practices rigorously, that's not enough. Then what about team play, the harmony among the team members? No, that's not enough either. In order to win, you will have to bring out the abilities you didn't know you had.""   As a fan of TSM from season 1 as well, I want to see them win worlds. I want to see Dyrus on the stage holding the World Championship Cup."
TeamSolomid,3d53if,Suspense304,2,Tue Jul 14 02:15:49 2015 UTC,My thoughts exactly! I'm glad you picked them up with my poor english.  I believe the whole team is in a slump even the coaching staff are having a rought time.   But we always get through the problems and hopefully we perform at worlds!
TeamSolomid,3d53if,akim1026,2,Tue Jul 14 02:31:35 2015 UTC,"Lustboy should play more alistar, the clg game was the best he's looked all split"
TeamSolomid,3d53if,llshuxll,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:25:06 2015 UTC,Didn't they say that the coaches were having the final say on what champs get played during practice? I'm assuming it'd be similar as far as on stage play goes. That would explain the Lustboy Shen thing - he just doesn't look comfortable on the champ and TSM as a team didn't use Shen properly (I.e. Pressuring the map heavily while Shen's ult is up and Dyrus' TP is up. Like how Gravity plays it).
TeamSolomid,3d53if,llshuxll,2,Wed Jul 15 01:14:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, my thoughts exactly. I watched the Saintvicious review of their game and his opinion was that they saw the Shen support, thought it was good and decided to use it for themselves without really practicing it or learning how to use it. That was completely the coaching staff's fault."

In fact, we've seen the players (and Loco) recognize that the reason for their bad play was mostly due to problems regarding communication and decision making.   As for not calling out players, I dunno man, I've seen numerous threads on this subreddit, in the past few weeks, that, unlike yours, called out Santorin, Loco and even Lustboy, some of them arguing they should be replaced, which is pretty sad."
TeamSolomid,3d53if,Lshrsh,-2,Tue Jul 14 15:25:04 2015 UTC,"At this point i think Tsm would do better without a coach than with locodoco. Not only does he draft terribly and turns everyone into a passive mistake fearing farm machine, he also is really unproffesional towards his players. Can you imagine Deilor spitting stupid memes like "" time to put the toucan back in his cage"" about one of his players after an okish first time lcs  appearance?? I think no other coach cares as much about his own image and is as tyrannical ( playstyle wise) and i think hes really starting to hurt tsm as a whole."
TeamSolomid,3d53if,Lshrsh,5,Mon Jul 13 17:19:58 2015 UTC,"I think that is an awful lot to speculate based on a reality show. Locodoco isn't playing the game. TSM plays passive because TSM's players are passive. Bjergsen has never been one to really push advantages when he has them outside of lane. Santorin isn't the type to counter jungle and gank early. Dyrus isn't going to go ham without Jungle support. Lustboy isn't an engage support. And Turtle can't really make plays alone, although he is aggressive."

Now Turtle looks somewhat better even though he still mispositions in fights. No one is blaming the losses on Turtle, dont make shit up, and I am pretty sure everyone who is not still salty after the 0-2 week can see that it is many problems including the basics of the game.

What I say is that Wt is the only one with his ass on fire (for a good reason) but I don't see TSM pressuring anyone else as if finding a better adc would rocket jump them at the top of the table.
TeamSolomid,3d4056,caat9,7,Mon Jul 13 10:00:18 2015 UTC,"I think whoever is in charge of pick and ban is concluding too much from scrims and too little from actual LCS performance.

TeamSolomid,3d4056,Lshrsh,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:53:02 2015 UTC,Yeah. It seems like they just want to play whatever comp they were practicing for the week instead of playing for optimal win conditions. This makes them kind of predictable.

Dyrus has been playing better as of late, but provides barely any pressure. Almost shocking to see him admit today's mistakes on twitter.  Santorin is a good player no doubt, but needs to be more aggressive early and less of an extra summoner spell for Bjerg. I would love to see Kikis replace him although TSM is usually slow in roster changes so odds are almost nothing.  Bjerg needs to have a bigger input in picks and bans if he doesn't already. The Ezreal games were so painful to watch and Orianna was almost as unimpactful. He's one of the best players in NA and can play a multitude of champs so why not give him a comfortable high impact champion.  I don't have much to say about botlane since they're flexing Turtle and Keith. Lustboy seems to be much more passive which is the right call at times, but TSM needs some one to engage.  As far as coaching goes, I hope they figure out the ""meta"" soon. The way they're playing atm, playoffs might be a struggle. Which I'd be okay with since even if they squeak through and get to worlds, TSM would simply repeat MSI and past worlds.  A world class team doesn't lose to lower tier teams. Nor do they play as poorly and passively as TSM have. If Worlds really is a goal, I'd love to see high pressure aggro play while minimizing mistakes like EDG, SKT and Fnatic"

If they cannot indentify their problems and help the team overcome those problems then they are not doing their job. Adding more people is not the answer but having the right people for the job is. Idk what Loco/Parth are doing but it feels like they are not doing anything because 0 problems have been fixed since MSI. In fact the one thing TSM was great at, teamfighting, has even degraded. If they do not produce results during playoffs, I will not be sad to let Loco go for another coach."

TeamSolomid,3d3f26,ljosquaredl,33,Mon Jul 13 05:45:46 2015 UTC,"I feel like they just need less rules. The way they play Loco probably has strict rules on how/when they can use summoners/ults/etc. A perfect example of this is Loco telling Turtle he can never flash for kills. Sounds good on paper, but I see people doing it all the time and it works. Faker was on Yi and flashed past tier 2 turret in front of base for a kill.   When Piglet went for dragon steal, altho they probably knew he didn't have vision, Santorin coulda ulted him away to make sure he didn't fire a rocket into pit...or could have used his smite:P   So many other teams just use their resources and make plays, but idk feels like TSM is scared to use their resources sometimes in game so Loco and Parth can't use it later as ammunition for game review talking points.  On TSM Legends they go thru so many points on what they can and can't do in game, etc. It all just feels way too strict, sometimes you just gotta feel the game out and play off things on the spot...right?"
TeamSolomid,3d3f26,ljosquaredl,12,Mon Jul 13 05:25:13 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the only way to be successful in anything in life is to make mistakes beforehand  Regi and Loco keep saying the regular season doesn't matter and that they're trying new stuff yadda yadda but they aren't afraid to even make mistakes, they look afraid to play at all  Last year we were in a rough patch too, but we were constantly pushing what we were doing to the limits, TSM looked improved every week and suddenly the mistakes that cost us games looked like the cause of our wins, because we learned from it"
TeamSolomid,3d3f26,Zellough,3,Mon Jul 13 06:41:13 2015 UTC,"Well I think experiment time should be over. I was fine with the experimental game against T8, it really didn't matter. The P/B against TL just looked so sloppy. After two bans, they had the perfect setup, and they just shot themselves in the foot instead of forcing TL's hand.    TSM Bans: Olaf, Kalista  TL Bans: Sivir, Ryze  First pick targets for TSM: Alistar, Nidalee, Nautilus, Gragas, RekSai  First pick targets for TL: Alistar, Nautilus, Gragas, RekSai, Azir  I think TSM was trying to bluff that they could first pick Azir, forcing TL to ban him and securing Nidalee for Santorin but TL called it, and it put TSM on the back foot the entire rest of the draft.   There were two choices that I think would've been better: banning Azir, or banning Gragas/RekSai.     Banning Azir: gets TSM either Alistar or Nidalee, and gets Fenix off Azir.   TL is either forced to ban Alistar, giving TSM Nidalee or they ban a jungler and give TSM Alistar.   TSM first picks whatever TL didn't ban. If they get Alistar, TSM loses nothing because TL isn't going to pick both S-tier junglers. TL probably picks Nautilus and an ADC or a jungler. TSM can pick an ADC and a jungler and then forces TL into revealing their whole comp. They have Nautilus + 3 picks, so they either reveal where Nautilus is, or let Bjergsen counterpick mid.    Banning Gragas/RekSai: either gets TSM Alistar or forces Dom onto a non-S-tier jungler.   TL is either forced to ban the other S-tier jungler, giving TSM Alistar, or they ban Alistar and TSM first picks whatever jungler they didn't ban.   The picks get a little more murky after this because there are a lot more possibilities, but already TSM have an edge by denying Dom an S-tier jungler.     Either of these cases would've been better than banning Alistar, but TSM got greedy and paid for it."

TeamSolomid,3d3f26,DontPanak,17,Mon Jul 13 07:21:20 2015 UTC,"If anything they probably need less coaching. From just watching TSM Legends you see how strict Loco is about exactly what needs to happen and it shows in their play. If anything is even remotely risky or 'sub optimal/not by the numbers' then TSM won't do it.   Everything TSM does is incredibly predictable and rehearsed, if a team does anything out of the ordinary that TSM hasn't seen before they just freeze up and turtle until they either lose or capitalize on when the enemy makes a mistake.   It's almost like none of the players actually bother reading or reacting to the actual game and just follow the playbook to the T."

They don't go for any aggressive plays or really do anything proactive. This might come from how strict Loco seems to be on the guys, but I don't think that is the only problem.

TeamSolomid,3d41rd,Sympwny,2,Mon Jul 13 12:51:48 2015 UTC,"While i agree that loco and parth have helped TSM greatly. Its honestly their pick ban phase lately that has really screwed them. It has just been horrendous. Look at the TL games yesterday. They wasted a ban on olaf only to first pick gragas with rek sai still available and give TL 2 OPs in their first round. One of which was Azir that is a huge play making champ on the hands of fenix. Then after giving it up they tried to counter with ap Ezreal mid. Now i might not be a challenger player but i still know thats not a good lane for Ezreal. I think loco really needs to take a step back and look at his drafting tier list and the way he handles picks and bans.  Edit: they picked ori. Which is still not very good into azir. She has low mobility low kill potential early, and allows azir to free farm same as an ez pick."
TeamSolomid,3d41rd,dominiion,2,Mon Jul 13 15:32:12 2015 UTC,"You mean orianna, right?   Your point is still valid.  My issue is that choices being made feel ""stale"".  I'm no pro, but it feels predictable and lacks ANY pressure on the other team.  I'd rather go down in a blaze of glory forcing the issue than waiting to die a death of a thousand papercuts.  I really like the direction TSM appears to be going with the coaching ensuring that everyone knows what they're doing ahead of time, but using that tactic seems to have stifled creativity and aggressiveness. I'm just not sure how you find the middle ground though...  Good luck the rest of the way TSM, we'll be following and supporting you.  Fans do that."

TeamSolomid,3d41rd,dominiion,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:04:55 2015 UTC,"I dont think the 2 games they lost were due to pick ban but more execution. In the T8 game, you could tell they were playing very safe,  and passive, most likely because they felt they were behind from towers and kills, when in reality they werent that behind. This made them avoid teamfights and picks that they could have gotten.   In the TL game, I don't think one comp was much better than the other. It went down to whoever played well. TSM made many many  avoidable mistakes, forcing too much at blue buff, missed smites, team engages on nautilus, getting caught out in jg when lanes are pushing. The Olaf ban was questionable, but we don't know if they had some scrims information and weren't familiar playing with it, whereas Azir they do have information on it."
TeamSolomid,3d41rd,fit_anon,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:38:35 2015 UTC,"No im not saying their team composition are the problem, im saying they are being out drafted. Yes you want to draft a  cohesive team. But you also need to get a priority lane in drafting. And selecting and ori or ez into an azir which just want to farm up with little kill pressure in lane, even knowing fenix's azir is godly, and you had the chance to pick it away. A scaling marksman in jinx to freeze a laneswap. And a tank top lane. There is no lane priority anywhere to make a play on for the gragas that was first picked for no reason (all early game jungles were avalible) losing grag in first rotation would have zero effect on strat. They just have been completely botching how they draft not the team comps that they are drafting."
TeamSolomid,3d41rd,dominiion,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:21:10 2015 UTC,"TSM prefers Gragas over Rek'sai for disengage/engage/peel. First picking Gragas actually made sense, since that doesnt show TL what comp their going for. They most likely knew fenix would go for azir, because in the next rotation they went for Maokai/Shen. Those picks are meant to target fenix. Picking Maokai/Shen also meant they weren't showing too much for liquid's 3rd and 4th pick.   Against TL, they had to respect Quas, Fenix, and Piglet, so I think they might have tried to draft by reaction. The good and bad thing about this meta is that priority lane is not easy to blindly pick anymore. There are SO many power picks to consider, and I think that's why TSM wanted to let TL pick first before reacting. Granted, I still think TSM are having some problems with draft, but I would not consider the loss against TL to be mostly due to draft and would say they drafted pretty well, but made too many in-game mistakes that were avoidable."
TeamSolomid,3d41rd,fit_anon,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:09:28 2015 UTC,"that my friend is where your wrong. there was no reason for them to pick Gragas first pick, no matter how much the prioritize him. there were to many ops open to be able to first pick a jungler. secondly them picking shen and maokai in the second rotation showed their entire hand, they didnt use the fact that shen could be a flex pick. and they didnt get an op. it screamed to liquid we want to dive your carry and lock him down on our terms. and then they picked two carry champs that kind of negate the point of having a shen support. im not saying that drafting is was lost tsm that game. they had a very solid team fight comp but in the grand scheme of the season their drafting phase has dropped a great deal. had TSM ban say, a gnar or rumble over olaf. and first picked azir away from fenix your now denying 2 strong comfort picks away from liquid and there is still a good chance that dominate is going to take reksai over gragas for you to pick up in the second rotation along with the flex pick of shen. now team liquid must try and counter your strong pick and decide how they want to deal with a shen not knowing if he will be top or support. its just as if loco doesnt think of all the scenarios in a drafting phase when hes preparing and gets thrown for a loop when its comes time to pick."
TeamSolomid,3d41rd,dominiion,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:51:44 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say one pick-ban method is wrong or right. You're style is pick the more op or deny the enemy team, but I think Loco was going for try to counter as many picks as possible. Both styles are valid imo, but TSM have tried the ""pick op into whatever"" and it didn't work for them as well as when they picked reactionary. I'm sure he knew Fenix would go for Azir if TSM didnt pick him first. TSM also like to counter-pick the enemy mid rather than blind pick if they can.   The point of picking Gragas was to show the least and the least risky first pick. Quas and Fenix both have deep champion pools so they wanted to get some idea of what comp TL might be building, and have the possibility of countering. TSM has always emphasized their ability to team fight and Gragas does that the best out of the top tier jg (Eve, Gragas, Rek'sai). He brings reliable peel, disengage or engage, and scales well throughout all periods of the game. His teamfight utility, which is what TSM likes, is much better. Not to mention, Santorin has favored Gragas over Rek'sai and hasn't shown to be that great of an Eve player.   If you're saying TSM picked 2 carries that negate the point of having shen support, then I don't think you understand shen's kit as much as you think. Shen allows you to peel for your carries by taunting enemies that dive your carries and provide shields for them, or can engage with taunt as well. Banning Olaf was questionable, but we also don't know if Dom was wrecking scrims with him or not. TSM most likely decided to ban Olaf knowing that they don't have experience playing against him, and would rather Fenix go Azir because they have practice with it and know how to play around it (at least in scrims :\ ). If you look at Dyrus' match history, it's pretty obvious that LB would play the Shen rather than Dyrus.   Both arguments for pick-ban methods are valid, but the pick-ban for this game was not at all bad compared to the Gravity game."
TeamSolomid,3d41rd,fit_anon,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:21:32 2015 UTC,"well to begin there is no counter picking from blue side. red side has the counter pick. so if tsm strat was to counter pick as much as possible they failed miserably at it. gragas wasnt even a contested pick. they could have easily picked a higher priority champion and still got grag in the second rotation. second gragas didnt really fit into the team comp that tsm was building. they had heavy engage with an orianna that wants to pull eveyone in with her ult. gragas directly counters that and a rek sai would have fit much better into the comp. lastly is the shen kit.. the point of picking the shen support is to allow your adc to be alone in a lane farming and pushing while shen is over the map getting wards and applying pressure to other lanes while still being able to turn and odd man situation into one that can favor you. but with picking jinx she still isnt able to do that because she has no escapes, they needed to pick someone like ezreal to match the triforce of corki or tristana for tower pushing. and i know for a fact that olaf was horrible ban because dominate has a 33% win rate on him over 15 games, and his most played champion in the jungle is rek sai, as well as olaf is in a terrible spot right now in the meta.  tsm just tired to pick a scaling team fight team and they got out played. they could have went about their pick ban alot better though, and at least tried to get one lane priority and azir could have given them that."
TeamSolomid,3d41rd,dominiion,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:29:32 2015 UTC,"There is counter picking from blue side. Other than first pick, you get 4 picks to try and counter the first 4 picks from red. TSM's idea was to give them as much room to counter pick as possible. Of course TL's last pick is a definite counter pick, but when they picked Azir and Corki before the last pick, I'm sure TSM liked that because they got a good idea of TL's comp. And TSM would rather take Gragas, than leave it up to Dom to play, because TL know VERY well that Grag is Santorin's most comfortable pick. And Gragas doesnt directly counter that, he has so many different ways you can play his kit in a teamfight. He can ult Azir/Corki away in teamfights, kill tanks and then re-engage on the carries. Or if they get caught out, he can disengage very reliably. He provides the bodyslam to peel for carries and he has good early jg presence without falling off late game, but yes, Santorin did not use that well, which I think is more on him and the team than the actual pick.   You are dialing too much into ONE aspect of Shen's kit. Yes that is one good aspect of shen, but he also helps layer the CC that TSM can utilize in teamfights. Maokai, Grag, Shen, Ori, even Jinx all have good zoning or single target lockdowns. Look at the other ADC/Shen pairs that other teams are running. They have gone with immobile hyper-carries as well (most notably, Gravity). Picking Ezreal against Corki is not a great choice, because, again, TSM prioritizes champs that team fight well. I agree, Tristana would have been a decent pick as well, but it's not like Jinx is a terrible pick for tower pushing either. Problem is, you are stating that these things that you do know for a fact. Obviously the Olaf ban was questionable, but you don't know how scrims went or if TSM had some secret information. Maybe he was spamming him in scrims and wrecking teams and TSM didn't want to take the risk of playing because they didnt have practice against him. With Azir, they knew how to play against him and knew their win conditions with their comp. Taking Rek'sai away from Dom wouldn't have been that great anyways, since Rek'sai provides considerably less in teamfights and in scaling. And I'm sure they knew Dom would be comfortable playing Nunu/Sej/Gragas if Rek'sai was taken away.   You are tunneling way too much on the Azir pick. That alone did not lost them the pick-ban. I think TSM was actually pretty happy with the pick-ban because they knew how to win the game with it, AND how to stop Fenix's Azir. TSM went with a comfortable comp that they had success with in the past (HUGE front-line, hyper-carry adc, and ori for teamfighting and shields). Big difference was the very poor mistakes they made. They already made the mistaking of invading blue improperly, then let TL steal baron, which snowballed that team so hard. If TSM had taken baron, they could have just as easily swung the game heavily in their favor."
TeamSolomid,3d41rd,fit_anon,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:48:47 2015 UTC,"Have you ever heard of a helicopter parent? That's essentially what the TSM coaching staff has become. They try and control the team for the whole game and stop them doing anything they think is right that might go against the staff. While I don't think they should just sit back and do nothing, they definitely need to step back and let them have some freedom in their play. Let turtle flash for an early, or something along those lines."
TeamSolomid,3d41rd,raomina,2,Mon Jul 13 17:28:22 2015 UTC,"I agree. Their play feel too rehearsed and rigid, which is why they can't seem to adapt in game at all. The instructions to the team, from what it appears to us from TSM Legends etc., seem to be 'do this when this happens, do this when that happens', or 'don't flash for kills', all of which are not necessarily true all the time and just makes the player hesitate to do anything they feel might be instinctively the right thing to do at that time. It feels like they don't emphasize teaching the players the reasonings of why things are done and instead depend on rote memorization, as they seem to 'forget' how to play a certain way once the meta changes or when they focus on practising another aspect of the game like dragon priorization. Like, how can Dyrus 'forget' how to play tanks and build ninja tabis in the TL game when a pro player should be able to look at the enemy team and make an educated decision during the game? Must they practise this 10 times before they learn how to do that or must Loco tell them to build MR specifically before the game for them to do it?"

TeamSolomid,3d0srn,IamDeukrezia,24,Sun Jul 12 15:47:35 2015 UTC,Ah my favorite TSM roster...
TeamSolomid,3d0srn,Luminancee,-21,Sun Jul 12 17:06:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah I loved this roster, I mean who didn't love watching us choking vs a shit SK gaming to take us the hard side of the bracket."
TeamSolomid,3d0srn,LOLrusty,6,Sun Jul 12 19:16:32 2015 UTC,"TSM had a good shot against White.  They didn't play out that series very well, blew a game on Lee / Yas combo and then won with the same comp except J4 over Lee.  They also got severely out picked in game 4."
TeamSolomid,3d0srn,ekjohnson9,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:10:59 2015 UTC,good shot is a little bit optimistic...

TeamSolomid,3d0srn,LOLrusty,3,Sun Jul 12 20:19:59 2015 UTC,It's better than any other roster ever did at Worlds
TeamSolomid,3d0srn,JarBarSteve,14,Mon Jul 13 00:45:15 2015 UTC,"Amazing is the best jungler TSM ever had. He was (is) a proactive, aggresive, playmaking jungler and he also managed the early game.  The reason he ""underperformed"" at the start of summer s4 was because he got into the team in a rushed manner with little time to build up synergy with the team plus they also changed supports, so really the reason why TSM was bad was because of the team not because of Amazing (and his supposedly shallow champion pool which quickly became basically a meme).  If Amazing would've gotten into TSM in the same way Santorin did, with plenty of time to ease himself in, it would've been great. A shame that he was kinda bullied so much when he was on the team."
TeamSolomid,3d0srn,poro_wu,3,Sun Jul 12 20:45:02 2015 UTC,Amazing is the best jungler TSM ever had.   The GodOne says otherwise.
TeamSolomid,3d0srn,Zellough,5,Sun Jul 12 20:48:37 2015 UTC,TSM never got past their original seeding in worlds with TheOddOne except on Season 1  TSM couldn't even beat C9 when OddOne was on the roster

TeamSolomid,3d0srn,xxGamma,35,Wed Jul 15 02:09:36 2015 UTC,"I know this sucks to think about, but I really think losing Amazing hurt TSM a lot. We can't know if TSM would be better or worse off right now, but I feel that Amazing's playstyle is needed in the team in this meta.. I mean, Santorin can play that playmaking style, look at his nidalee, but he isn't and I feel the lack of pressure from the jungle is a big reason as to why TSM look so, kinda, lost in this meta.."
TeamSolomid,3d0srn,xxGamma,14,Sun Jul 12 16:29:33 2015 UTC,"I know losing Amazing was a big change but I think Santorin is as good as Amazing in terms of skills but it's not about the jungler, it's about the whole team making passive play throughout a game. I think it's all because of locodoco's ""let's just play it slowly"". Man, that is too slow, they're losing the opportunity to make these kind of game. they're being too careful that it greatly affect them negatively."
TeamSolomid,3d0srn,majaestic,6,Sun Jul 12 17:26:09 2015 UTC,"A lot of early game pace is dictated by the jungler. There's an effective way of playing slowly by getting good wards and shutting down the enemy jungler, forcing the game to be played slowly as very little plays can be made. Amazing was pretty good at this and so WAS Santorin at IEM, but currently TSM don't seem to know how to play slowly efficiently and I think a lot of that is down to the jungler. I like Santorin and think he has great (im sorry) potential,  but I think this potential is more carry orientated rather than oddone-esque."
TeamSolomid,3d0srn,r_slash_squid,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:10:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah man, Santorin in Spring split playoffs especially was such a fkn beast. He shut down some of the best jg's at the time (Metoes & Rush) and pretty much dominated the early game with some intelligent plays. I just don't think he's been playing with anywhere near that level of confidence this split. The whole team's looked far less confident since MSI"
TeamSolomid,3d0srn,LOLrusty,2,Mon Jul 13 14:40:21 2015 UTC,"Amazing's skill wasn't the only thing lost when he left, though. He also acted as a shotcaller, and when he left, it was almost entirely placed on Bjerg."
TeamSolomid,3d0srn,xxGamma,-3,Sun Jul 12 18:30:32 2015 UTC,"You are only saying this because amazing is in highlight clips of the video, when we first acquired santorin, we were still making plays, I mean a game that was much better than the tsm vs sk game, was the TSM vs CJ game with bjerg on viktor. Sometimes TSM plays these weird games where they just slow roll until they lose, but it's not a consistent play-style they keep, just recently we are talking about how great there synergy was with the play vs CLG. Stop jumping to rushed conclusions."
TeamSolomid,3d0srn,LOLrusty,5,Sun Jul 12 19:14:59 2015 UTC,"Maybe this is a rushed conclusion based on recent events. But a team who's intention is to win worlds, losing to T8 and having insanely close games with mid/bottom tier NALCS teams isn't good enough. I'm not saying that if they still had Amazing all these problems would go away as that is a ridiculous statement.. At least when TSM had Amazing they could dumpster bottom tier teams and have closer games against top tier teams.. Who knows how they would have progressed. I also think their pick and ban right now is pretty appalling."
TeamSolomid,3d0srn,LivanEh,0,Sun Jul 12 19:21:14 2015 UTC,"I mean, I agree with us not playing well right now. But it has nothing to do with the amazing santorin change, santorin has made our jungle a lot more consistent and an overall improvement. I just think the team, as well structured as they are, are focusing more on not making mistakes, that actual game objectives, and I think this comes down to the amount of coaching, you see loco before every game goign through bullet points of ""turtle dont extend"", ""lust dont ward on your own"" ""dont do this, remember not to do this"", so our players just focus on not making mistakes, which just makes us get slowrolled into losses, instead of making more mistakes, but winning fights and taking control of the game."
TeamSolomid,3d0srn,Suspense304,11,Sun Jul 12 19:25:50 2015 UTC,League was so much better last season honestly. You don't see this kind of play now. It's all cinderhulk junglers now and smite lanes. No assassins either like Zed anymore.
TeamSolomid,3d0srn,Memoryk,9,Sun Jul 12 20:44:04 2015 UTC,Watch EU and LCK... That aggressive play is normal everywhere outside of this lame NA region... As a TSM fan it hurts to even admit it.
TeamSolomid,3d0srn,Periodd,16,Mon Jul 13 00:50:33 2015 UTC,"I think problem is in the passive play in early game and pick/bans. Against Gravity we got heavily outpicked. Also I dont understand why is Bjergsen forced to play 2 champions (Azir, Ezreal) when he has giant champion poll. I am and always will be hardcore TSM fan and will support no matter what but the game against Team8 was just lame and pain to watch. I am slowly loosing faith in Locodoco...Hope todays game will be better!"
TeamSolomid,3d0srn,Zellough,8,Sun Jul 12 17:41:09 2015 UTC,"I'll be completely honest, ever since the spring finals, or more specifically pre-MSI, I feel like Lustboy's been lacking. I feel like I'm the only one who thinks this way but compared to how aggressive and how much pressure he had on the games he played back then, he's not playing as good imo. Like, whenever Bjerg/Wildturtle were in trouble, he would come out of nowhere with an amazing save or some type of outplay and help the team secure their lives or kills. I feel like as of now, the team's okay (not amazing, but everyone does their job) but if Lustcena were to return to his former playstyle, TSM would be a team to be reckoned with. Also, their analysts/coach keep coming up with some iffy comps, like why is Bjergsen playing Ezreal, jesus."
TeamSolomid,3d0srn,Ronny0,5,Sun Jul 12 22:07:51 2015 UTC,"It really feels like Lustboy is playing in retirement mode right now, i get a feeling of arrogance and carefree-ness from his play, his twitter posts and the way he acts in the TSM legends videos, I dunno what's going on with him"

TeamSolomid,3d0srn,j1mmyava1on,6,Sun Jul 12 22:35:57 2015 UTC,They were also underdogs. I think that may be a part of it people are overlooking. They overperformed by getting out of groups at Worlds S4... They overperformed by winning IEM as underdogs... Then they go into MSI where everyone thinks they are top 3 and can honestly compete with CN and KR and they completely failed.  I think they are folding under the pressure of having actual expectations on them. I think that the weekly series may be taking an effect on them because it is putting their business out there for everyone to judge each week. Every mistake is exposed and I think all of that is really taking effect on the team's play.
TeamSolomid,3d0srn,Suspense304,-2,Mon Jul 13 00:53:57 2015 UTC,Overperformed? They were expected to get out of groups at worlds since they had the weakest group and svenskeren got banned for 1/2 of the games.
TeamSolomid,3d0srn,kallicks,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:11:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the team wasn't a team that should have gotten out of groups at Worlds. They weren't quarterfinal quality. They got a great group draw and benefitted from the SK suspension (however, they may have still beat SK one out of two anyway).  You are giving reasons that they made the quarterfinals but you're not understanding why it's overperforming. They made it further than a team of their skill should have."
TeamSolomid,3d0srn,ekjohnson9,5,Mon Jul 13 17:34:05 2015 UTC,"I feel like a lot of today's TSM's problems are attributed to SAntorins personality, in comparison to when amazing was in. Amazing seemed to be a much stronger personality, shot calling being very vocal. Santorin I think is a better jungler, but I don't think he is as good on TSM as amazing."
TeamSolomid,3d0srn,lurkedlongtime,4,Sun Jul 12 21:27:59 2015 UTC,"Posting worlds footage isn't fair to TSM, considering they were boot camping in Korea going into the tournament and playing a fuck ton of Korean SoloQ.  More fair footage would be last year's summer split, near the endish right around when they got Lustboy.     They had similar issues / problems last year, especially with Pick/Ban."
TeamSolomid,3d0srn,Skitter_Scat,4,Sun Jul 12 20:00:34 2015 UTC,"Honestly though. Remember where TSM was this time of year before Worlds? Wasnt pretty. Took a good playoff run.  Now obviously, there was a bit more to warrant that, all though TSM was arguably slumping harder then than now.  Of course TSM replaced Gleeb, and Amazings first split."
TeamSolomid,3d0srn,remakeprox,4,Sun Jul 12 22:48:01 2015 UTC,"TSM slumps but usually turns it on for playoffs.  LCS team trends. CLG looks to be the best team in NA then crashes and burns right before and at playoffs. Dig starts hot and then starts losing half way through the split. TSM does okay early and then starts falling off but still wins games it just isn't pretty. They look weak and then at playoffs they show up.  I think TSM will turn it on for playoffs and worlds. Honestly I think they are having an identity crisis. They've been playing a ton of these poke passive and slow team comps. But I honestly think they do better when they play more aggressive, teamfighting, and decisive comps. Think the game they had against CLG when they all just went HAM in CLG's jungle and there was that amazing wombo.  They'll get back there. I have faith."

TeamSolomid,3d0srn,Cholecosa,6,Sun Jul 12 21:26:19 2015 UTC,"I dont think anyone has fallen off. I have read all these comments and the majority thinks its the players fault for TSMs poor performance. Like any other team, it is the coaches fault 90% of the time. Recently Loco has been making weird comps in my opinion. Against TL TSM ran a low damage dual threat comp which didnt make sense to me. You put Bjergsen (the usual hard carry of of TSM) on a lower damage supportive style mid laner with the only other damage being turtle on jinx. The idea might of been to shockwave backline and have turtle crit a few time to get resets and clean up. I dont know if he even saw TL picks but they would of had to win the mid game for that strat to work which was unlikely. One of NA's best adc's on corki is almost a guaranteed win in the mid game if you play it right. Which TL did and had a pretty easy win imo.   Loco also doesnt seem to recognize the potential in his players. He put Lustboy (Top 3 supports NA) on shen. Lustboy litteraly had 0 impact on the game and he seemed uncomfortable on it compared to other champions. I would rather have lustboy on thresh or alistar or another play making champ than shen.   On to Dyrus. Dyrus has a 3-0 record this split on rumble but Loco insist on putting Dyrus on supportive tanky top laners. It might be out of fear of MSI part 2 but no NA team is good enough to do that. Right now TSM only consistent damage threat is Bjergsen if hes on someone like azir. Turtle is doing a lot better at not going so ham but i feel like he doesnt bring a lot of damage. Kieth just chokes on stage from nerves. Santorin just plays farmville and doesnt play carries like nidalee or junglers like lee sin. (cough rush) So the only damage is usually Bjerg and Turtle, making it easier for other teams to just kill the 2 carries.  Its a shame for bjergsen that assassins arent in the meta because I feel like those are his stronger champions. This split his only undefeated champions are leblanc (which we will probably not see again until shes buffed) and azir (sitting at 4-0). The similarity between these are they are high damage play making champions. They can have a huge impact on the game. One thing bjergsen is lacking is a competitive champion pool. I know he can play alot of other champions loco doesnt pick them. For comparison Bjerg played 6 champions in 14 games while faker played 11 champions in 19 games. Maybe bjerg and loco are saving them as pocket picks for playoffs but imo the first round by is more important than saving pocket picks.   I dont even want to talk about santorin. He plays into the NA style. Very reserved and safe. Doesnt take any risk and doesnt get any reward. He should learn how to play more agressive and put pressure on the map. In all the other regions that have god junglers (korea/china) there job is to pressure the map. You rarely see them sit in the jungle for 10-20 mins just waiting for a team fight or a drag fight. TSM could dominate NA if they adapted a more EU style of game play.  Turtle has improved since his benching but he is just not a top adc anymore. He is best used as cleanup for the rest of the team. Kieth is pretty much on the same level as turtle but has more potential than turtle. Seeing how his lol career has just started.   NA is the weakest region right now without a doubt. The inconsistency of the top teams as well as the inferior style of passive play and weaker players leads to sort of a power vacuum in NA that has been claimed by GV (Im going to kill myself if the beat  one more top team) for the moment.  Message to Loco: Your decisions as a coach recently have not been up to standards with the brand you are representing. You tunneled into AP ezreal, which is a shitty pick imo, and have not been giving your players the proper tools in order to win games. As I said in the beginning, a teams success and and failures in 90% the coachers fault.   Wall of text over."
TeamSolomid,3cz4my,WeDemBoyz007,19,Sun Jul 12 02:32:14 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. With this patch, yes runeglaive Ezreal is strong, but it is not bjergsens play style at ALL. He was known for assassin's that he could destroy someone early in lane with, and he is put on a poke champion. He is not a bad ezreal, but I'd rather see him on something more... him. The ""strong"" pick isn't ALWAYS the best pick if you are better on other things. I think Keane is a great example of this considering that he plays almost ANYTHING mid because it is what HE is good and comfortable on that fits for the team, not just what someone else did well with. I'm tired of the whole ""copy the Asians"" bullshit. Form your own teams using player strengths not just champion strengths.  It's what fnatic does too, and look at them."
TeamSolomid,3cz4my,LostInTheAyther,4,Sun Jul 12 05:19:47 2015 UTC,"the problem is there aren't terribly many assassin's that are good now, zed, LeBlanc, and many 1 shot Champs have been nurfed where they can't 1 shot anymore without being fed and it's hard to be fed when loco is telling Santorin to farm"
TeamSolomid,3cz4my,pinkluloyd,-1,Sun Jul 12 16:22:17 2015 UTC,It's not just on loco. Santorin isn't that great of a jungler
TeamSolomid,3cz4my,Cptsaber44,0,Mon Jul 13 11:36:37 2015 UTC,"another problem is that Bjergsen doesn't have any comfort/unique picks. If you watch his stream, he literally only plays champions that are meta and is not able to develop his own style, or unique champion for the mid lane."
TeamSolomid,3cz4my,kira_senpai,9,Mon Jul 13 03:04:42 2015 UTC,"So I posted this in the passiveness thread, but it rings true here, so pls don't hate me for posting it again. Warning: Long, tldr at the bottom  It is an early game problem, for certain. Any top team would be able to dismantle shitters like Team 8 in the first ten minutes. I don't think it's one issue, I also don't think a single person is at fault, or even holds the most burden. I'm pretty sure this is going to get longwinded, and I'm also fairly certain no one will read this, as this post is five hours old. Regardless, here are my thoughts. For this, I'll be looking at when TSM had the most success, which is to say Summer 2014 Playoffs - MSI.  At their core, TSM has garnered their most success from creating pressure on the enemy mid laner, and to a lesser extent, the enemy jungler. This style was taken to it's highest level last split, where TSM would create a massive amount of chaos through laneswaps and level 1s. With this chaos, TSM would play almost like a slightly more measured Chinese team in Season 3, where they would gank the ever loving shit out of anyone that they could. So the logical thing to presume is that the early game is dependent on Santorin/Amazing, Lustboy, and to a lesser extent, Dyrus, right? Wrong. The person who always set the pace was  Bjergsen. Even when TSM could find success on exclusively deathball comps during Season 4 Worlds, Bjergsen would receive the most amount of pressure from TSM's supporting cast, despite WildTurtle being the late game carry. Bjergsen's ability to tangle with the best in one-on-one situations is TSM's greatest asset, and this is one that has been abused, but forgotten.  So why this departure, is it meta based? Most would argue that, but the problem with that logic is that the very best team in the world right now has a system TSM can copy almost perfectly. Maximum resources allocated to the mid laner, and all residual resources going to the top laner, as the AD is far too inconsistent to bank on. There's a reason SKT isn't playing shit like Ezreal and Cho'gath, they don't exert pressure early. Bjergsen is the one that sets the pace for TSM, Faker is the one that does it for SKT. Bjergsen needs to be able to do things as soon as possible, and he can. Loco has consistently failed to enable Bjergsen's ability to affect the game by shoving him on picks that simply do not have impact to create leads with, despite options being available. Azir, Viktor, Ryze, Irelia (a champion I know Bjergsen fucking loves), TF, and Yi. All these champs can create pressure in one-on-one laning, as well as capitalize on chaos created in lane swaps.  Giving Bjerg this power creates incentive and opportunity to let Lustboy and friends do what made Lustboy a player that was in the conversation for most effective support in the entire world last split. Put pressure on mid so that Bjerg can put pressure on the rest of the map. This is where Bjerg get's some scrutiny, Bjerg will constantly stay in lane to try and take advantages over his opponent, even when opportunities are present to take the advantage he already has and use it to inflict damage on the rest of the enemy team.  Now, to facilitate this, you need chaos, which is to say, fuck with the enemy team in early lane swaps. I'll admit, I don't know a shit-ton about laneswaps, or at least not much more than the shit people say in a cast or vod review. But one thing I do know is that the drafts and changes to the champions Bjergsen is put on removes a bargaining chip, and that's mid lane dominance. The mid lane is the true reservoir of information on the map, and TSM has all the tools to reap the bounty of this reservoir if they create drafts to enable it. Look closer and you can see a feedback loop, TSM's supporting cast can't put pressure on the map because Bjergsen doesn't have a strong-armed lead, and thus TSM's supporting cast can't help Bjergsen create a lead. To be frank, this is simply avoiding TSM's strengths in their two greatest assets, Lustboy and Bjergsen. Playing against this style nets TSM games that are even at 20 minutes, because Dyrus and Wildturtle can't create a lead with or without assistance. This is okay if SOMEONE can, and someone can, but they're not, because they're being told not too once the draft comes through.  TLDR: Bjergsen needs priority back, as well as changes to his champion pool, TSM needs more intricate and innovative laneswaps (or at least copy the most intricate ones from successful teams and adapt them) in order to free up Lustboy and Santorin to do things around the map."
TeamSolomid,3cz4my,ZirGsuz,3,Sun Jul 12 07:30:54 2015 UTC,"That was beautifully written. Well done. Completely agree, the best tsm ever was when they got mid priority and managed to allow turtle to farm up midst the chaos they created, giving them some sort of late game insurance if the game does stall out or just straight up snowballing on the enemy team. I sais this yesterday too, but tsm play much better when theyre the ones incharge of setting the pace of the game, and they need to stop straying away from that. In no way ever is a passive style going to work at worlds so they need to work towarda being more aggressive and confident. I think Santorin needs to be worked with ASAP. Before worlds he needs to at least be at the level amazing was last worlds to even stand a chance."

TeamSolomid,3cz4my,ZirGsuz,3,Sun Jul 12 21:48:15 2015 UTC,"I really wish a TSM coaching staff, or Bjergsen would consider this and respond. I'd love to hear what faults they find with this opinion. You have a well formulated opinion here my friend."
TeamSolomid,3cz4my,Marco_Brolo_,2,Mon Jul 13 01:19:51 2015 UTC,"Good read.  This is going to mean very, very little coming from me, being a low ELO (Bronze...) player, but I would LOVE to see Bjerg play Mid Irelia, one of my ABSOLUTE favorite picks to make, even if I'm not good at all. Her potential to just destroy is crazy."
TeamSolomid,3cz4my,hayjay2000,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:15:28 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything here except for the fact that Bjergsen has played champions like Azir and Viktor already this split, several games in fact. But the difference between him and Faker is that he isn't able to exert the same pressure in lane and just snowball his lane and other lanes from there. The only game Bjergsen had a significant cs lead is that game where he played it against C9 where Bjergsen had close to a 100cs lead over Incarnation. But even so, he didn't do anything to snowball other lanes, didn't bank, didn't pressure anywhere on map and so they ended up losing. I also don't know where you got that Bjergsen loves Irelia. He only started playing it after Faker played it in LCK.. Compared to last split, Bjergsen just hasn't been able to have the same impact both in the lane and in the game.   And also how you said that every team can stomp a shit team like Team 8. That is true as we've seen many teams just destroy them in the first 10 mins of the game like CLG, or Gravity. That is, every team but TSM. TSM barely managed to win that first game until what dragged out to be a 40+min game and even lost the second game."
TeamSolomid,3cz4my,kira_senpai,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:10:18 2015 UTC,"I do address that Bjerg has problems staying in lane and not snowballing other lanes, which is his one major fault that is pulling him back from being an all-time great mid laner.  My point stands, Bjerg actually did things on the Azir picks. TSM hasn't played a ton of Viktor, but when he has he's managed to keep his lane down."
TeamSolomid,3cz4my,ZirGsuz,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:38:52 2015 UTC,"True. And I don't think he has to snowball as hard as Faker, Faker is just ridiculously good at that. Instead I think Bjerg excels at exerting pressure in one lane (mid) and hence freeing up the rest of the team to take advantage. Plus his team fighting is usually really good."
TeamSolomid,3cz4my,majaestic,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:21:28 2015 UTC,"Someone please tweet this comment to TSM.Was really well written and made a lot of sense.The best TSM ever did was S4 Worlds with this style,and they even took one game away from Samsung Galaxy White,the most dominant team in S4 Worlds,arguably one of the best teams in the world during all S4 (SSB was the only one that could reliably challenge them) and the best during Worlds.Why not try it again?It wasn't the reason they got fucked at MSI,that is for sure,I don't really get it."
TeamSolomid,3cz4my,RacistTurtle,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:26:15 2015 UTC,"This. I know they say they're trying a lot of new things - but lately all I've seen are late-game, slow scaling comps (AP ez, Jinx + Ori...). TSM right now is playing the exact same style as Elements, which is really frustrating because they have all the tools to be as dominant as Fnatic. The way I see it: put Dyrus on a scaling champ or tank (he's shown over and over he can be a rock for TSM), put Santorin on a carry jungler that forces him to gain an early advantage (e.g. like Rush/Move have been doing), put Bjerg on a mid-game carry that also scales well (Azir, Viktor, Diana), put Lustboy on a roaming support that has early impact (Baard, Thresh, Ali, Annie, Naut) and WT/Keith should just be on clean up duty. Edit: also to your point - TSM's previous strengths were getting an early game lead off mid pressure and just using that to rotate around the map and crush team fights. Wish they'd try that again"

TeamSolomid,3cz4my,majaestic,5,Mon Jul 13 15:38:01 2015 UTC,This post is completly wrong. If TSM copied LCK/LPL they would have a stronger early game and an idea on how to ward. Their P/B is fine for a majority of the games. None of you people that post here can actual do a correct P/B so please stop posting this salty shit. It is their game play that is lacking. They dig themselves such a huge hole that sometimes they cannot get themselves out of it even against bottom tier teams.
TeamSolomid,3cz4my,llshuxll,-2,Sun Jul 12 07:37:00 2015 UTC,Their P/B has been god awful for the majority of games.

TeamSolomid,3cz4my,remakeprox,2,Sun Jul 12 22:54:54 2015 UTC,"If TSM has a style, it's the one that fits their team name. When regi was playing, the team was centered around him carrying with his initiations and shotcalling. Currently, the team does the best when Bjergsen outlanes someone to snowball the rest of the game. I do wonder if the players are not doing too well because they are just playing whatever is meta instead of their strongest/favorite champs.They should all be flexible and know the meta champs of course, but TSM can maybe surprise people once in a while if they are not just following the meta all the time."
TeamSolomid,3cz4my,FatTeemo,2,Sun Jul 12 05:42:04 2015 UTC,"Reminds me of chogath at MSI all over again, they get so set on what they think is the best they cant or wont adapt to new stuff."
TeamSolomid,3cz4my,Tortillagirl,2,Sun Jul 12 12:06:56 2015 UTC,"TSM has never had their own style for as long as I can remember. All the way back to pre season 1 they were all just about adapting to what is meta at the time. They really lack the ability to think outside the box when it comes to playstyles and also picks/bans and whats viable. The most frustrating example of this to me is when say Bjergsen is absolutely god like on champs like Leblanc, Zed, Syndra and then a small nerf happens to the champ and instead of remembering that they were absolutely destroying teams because of how good Bjerg is on them and not just because the champ was strong they just think oh well better go onto the next strong champ and forget the one that you dominated everyone on.  TSM really only has the ability to play 1 playstyle these days. Bjergsen become god and carry team = the only one available to them. Dyrus has shown plenty that he doesnt have the ability to consistently carry no matter if he's on carry champs or not. Turtle is just not good enough to carry, and hes even less consistent than he is good. Lustboy is good enough to carry but unfortunately his position is the hardest to carry from. Santorin is good but he's only able to be a utility jungler."
TeamSolomid,3cz4my,phaneuf_fan_3,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:35:22 2015 UTC,"I agree that their picks come mainly from watching other regions. But their strategies are nothing like strategies in LCK/LPL. They may make similar picks but they play it in such a way that is just so passive that it makes the pick useless. An example would be playing Gregas jungle and Shen support. Once Shen hits 6, they should be looking to make plays across map, but they don't. This leads to a major strength of the champion simply being wasted. TSM might as well pick a Mundo support and they'll be making the same plays as they did in those games"

TeamSolomid,3cu1np,akim1026,19,Fri Jul 10 20:54:19 2015 UTC,"I think it's just that they didn't really get that their entire comp had been countered until they saw it being strangled and beaten in game. I think the important thing for Loco is that he immediately asks ""Did we get outdrafted?"" He doesn't try to look at the players or the game, he knows at that moment that this was lost completely in picks and bans and that was on him. That's an important feature in a person and a coach. He did think they could have played better but in the immediate moments after the loss he knew that the mistake laid largely on his shoulders."
TeamSolomid,3cu1np,Viruszero,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:58:49 2015 UTC,"For me it doesn't really feel like they prepare the players in-depth to the teams they're facing.

May be it just sounds like this for me, English not being my native language, but it realy doesn't feel like the players are getting nearly as much prepared as necessary (for professional players)."
TeamSolomid,3cu1np,Marmelade91,5,Sat Jul 11 10:19:26 2015 UTC,Keith did have a bad early game but why is he getting all the blame for the lane. Lustboy allowed that gank to happen because of where he stood and if Keith did not make the call for jungle pressure why cannot Lustboy? The only really bad thing he did was run in face first into trist/naut which allowed him to die. I am all for holding people responsible for bad play but come on....
TeamSolomid,3cu1np,llshuxll,13,Fri Jul 10 21:25:22 2015 UTC,"Because TSM has an accountability and responsibility system when it comes to shotcalling. The same way it is Lustboys responsibility to call support roams from base and Keiths/Turtles to call support roams from lane, I don't know if this is explicitly stated i'm just saying it as a reason, it would probably be the ADC's responsibility to call for jungle pressure in bot. The reason that it seems like they were shitting on Keith is because they were solely talking about his performance which wasn't great, noone blamed him for the game, they just said that he wasn't up to the TSM standard."
TeamSolomid,3cu1np,Viruszero,-10,Fri Jul 10 21:59:40 2015 UTC,That still does not explain why Lustboy moved forward aggressively after Santorin calls out that Eve is going to be bottom. He would have died if he was the focus but instead it is better to kill the adc. I just find it kind of lame that they drop him for Turtle who has been utter shit this split just because his early game had a mistake but still had a super high dpm that game and he never got caught out. Now they dont start him against T8. I guess we just need to see what happens in the last 3 weeks.
TeamSolomid,3cu1np,llshuxll,-1,Sat Jul 11 00:25:59 2015 UTC,"Honestly, if the players feel like the game was over at 10 minutes due to comps, they should just go ham and do risky plays to try to pull out a win instead of just letting the other team dictate the game. It doesn't matter if the game becomes a stomp and they lose because the game would've been lost anyway if the other team played correctly but at least there would've been a chance. They focus way too much on playing to their win conditions."

TeamSolomid,3cymrc,llshuxll,2,Mon Jul 13 01:27:41 2015 UTC,Zion is someone to look at. He is a strong toplaner and unless Lust or Santorin leave TSM can't import players.

TeamSolomid,3cymrc,MIASpartan,3,Mon Jul 13 02:39:44 2015 UTC,"They burn through top laners that don't well and from what I can see, Zion's an all around consistent player and he's usually never the reason why CLG loses (on multiple occasions he's the reason they've won). I doubt CLG will want to give him up unless they're going to import a top laner from Korea/China (lol though I doubt it based on how well that ended last time). If anything they're going to give up XMithie."

TeamSolomid,3cymrc,Marco_Brolo_,3,Sun Jul 12 00:10:01 2015 UTC,"in fairness, I do think this is a bit different, because Dyrus has said publicly that he is retiring after 2015 worlds.

I think Keith is a good player. He is def finely safer than turtle ever was. But turtle has the pottential to be a second carry if he steps up. Could go either way. Only time will tell

TeamSolomid,3ctwd1,Domeniks,5,Fri Jul 10 19:09:05 2015 UTC,"If they are playing Turtle. They must give him a hypercarry. It has been long since he's been playing something like Jinx or Ashe.(Although he did play Tristana).  Also Santorin should play more Jarvan. Although he is now very META he still applies TONS of map pressure and has permanent gank power.  Bjergsen should pick up cassiopeia IMO aswell.  oh god.. i ""suggest"" so many champions.. but I strongly believe TSM should play them. Dyrus' champion pool is the best right now.. he can basically play everything. Bjergsen seems to be locked in the Azir form, and Santorin is locked in the Rek'sai/Gragas playstyle.  Just like Fnatic in EU. They need to start building that multi-threat combo."

Any way to increase the size? This is a stretch but is there any way to change the font to make it the same style as the games or even put in the logos of the game. http://www.tsm.gg/ Like what you see here instead of just plain text. I don't know if that makes sense. Add DanDinh's stream to general.   Yeah that's pretty much all I got for now. Thanks!

At this moment I'm working on a small API myself, in order to get the match schedule and what not because the RIOT lcs api seems broken and non-responsive for the biggest part.

TeamSolomid,3cr26c,manslayer22,9,Fri Jul 10 03:47:09 2015 UTC,"My conspiracy theorist side makes me think/hope that TSMs current 'troubles' are a brilliant feint by Reginald. That TSM is carefully researching their LCS opponents, but also potential Worlds rivals and doing their practice and putting in their real effort during scrims, but presenting a faltering TSM to the world. All of this is so that when other teams research them, they only see what TSM shows them during LCS matches.    According to this theory, Reginald saw that TSM saw how easy it was for world teams to simply focus their midlaner last time around. So now teams are seeing a weaker TSM, and are lulled into a false sense of security.    Come Worlds, out come the real TSM, with the proper rotations, the slick wombo combo teamfights, and suddenly, new pocket picks reminiscent of UOL. And then all, sans Thorin, will praise Reginald's strategic brilliance yet again."
TeamSolomid,3cr26c,Provokyo,2,Fri Jul 10 05:51:35 2015 UTC,"When we lost to gravity, I was thinking about this exact thing. I doubt it is right but it wouldn't surprise me if this was true. The TSM atm doesn't look anywhere close to the TSM during IEM."
TeamSolomid,3cr26c,asianhawk28,2,Fri Jul 10 14:25:35 2015 UTC,"To be honest, as much as I love TSM and would rather give them the benefit of the doubt, I don't think this is the case. I think the meta hasn't been kind to TSM's current strategy and roster composition. Overall, I think the meta is fairly anti-carry, with most pro teams going with either dive-heavy or multi-threat comps that also are built around countering specific enemy champions/playstyles/tendencies.   This is what makes teams like SKT, EDG, FNC, H2K, and even Gravity so good. All of these teams heavily leverage counterpicks in their core strategy. TSM, while mechanically and strategically a very strong team, potentially also tends to be ""high risk"" averse, starting with pick/ban phase. This is in accordance with their overall micro-game of avoiding high-risk plays in LCS. I would go into a P/B analysis to support this, but I think everyone here has a pretty good idea of what TSM has used historically. In truth, TSM rarely picks counters outside of the mid lane. Traditionally, they simply stick with whatever happens to be OP at the moment, and fits their fight-heavy, mid-lane focused style.   All of this leads them to taking fewer risks in-game, bringing fewer overall threats, and allows them to focus on ""micro-punishments"" to get tiny leads over enemies (which they ironically don't even abuse themselves - they mostly just use to intimidate or bully enemies away with the threat of loss). When they can't strictly acquire these microleads, or they've been outright countered/outplayed in lane, they tend to turtle up and wait for late-game. The problem is, as has been proven so far, this only works against overall inferior-quality opponents. It doesn't work against top, world-class teams. It didn't work at IEM.    I think this has to do with TSM's strengths. TSM has, historically, been very good at adopting and incorporating new OP champs, strats, builds, and maneuvers. They have good, consistent players who are always at or among the top in NA. Players that dominate their respective lanes or go equal against the stars of other teams don't need to take big risks. They have beaten every in NA and many teams globally using this strategy. The problem is that they can't use this against teams that are better than they are, and when they do, they're out of their element. Teams like FNC on the other hand can take games off of SKT exactly because they're so used to playing on the edge, to picking counters, to building comps around dominating big laners, because that's the identity that they've adopted.   So here's the issue with your theory, and the issue that I have with TSM (my favorite team) winning worlds in general. Unless they put more work into beating teams that are strictly better than they are, they're not going to be able to do it with their current strat. They might be able to step up and get a few games off of them, but they cannot keep playing like they're the best team in the world when what they really mean is they're the best team in NA. NA isn't a bad region mind you, and TSM isn't a bad team (they're my favorite!), but I think they're hindering themselves with the strategy we see from week to week in LCS.   If TSM are going to improve, they need to start taking risks that may seem unnecessary and incorporating that into every layer of their strat. They they need to start playing like every team is better than they are, and has threats that they desperately need to counter. They need to start anticipating (or employing!) the Morgana tops, the Vlad mids, the Shen supports.   Or, that's my opinion, anyways."

Sean showed that he is arguably the best IGL that North America has (with the exception of DaZed because of his ban on professional play). Cloud9 is one of those teams right now that will either stay the same that they are (which is a mid-level tier one team at the moment), or could be one of the top five teams in the world."
TeamSolomid,3cm65f,katnizz,14,Thu Jul 9 00:03:53 2015 UTC,"I think it's very possible they are just rotating them.  Keith is on Twitter asking for LCS tickets for Sunday.  I think the Sunday part is very specific as he's asking for the tickets to invite friends to show up on Sunday.  That leads me to believe it's a rotation of Turtle Saturday, Keith Sunday."
TeamSolomid,3cm65f,lurkedlongtime,9,Thu Jul 9 00:30:25 2015 UTC,"I think you're onto something. It's really interesting that they're putting Keith against TL, especially against a very angry and godlike Piglet who is waiting for his revenge."
TeamSolomid,3cm65f,lurkedlongtime,6,Thu Jul 9 00:56:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if my speculation is correct (and I may be wrong) but it also sounds odd to try and purchase tickets from fans for his friends in a game he would be sitting on the bench.  However, I hope that If Keith vs Piglet does go down... Keith and Lust play lane bullies.  Because if they have the weaker lane i feel like piglet would be out for blood making sure hes in lane punishing Keith.  Because supposedly, Piglet does not like Keith at all."
TeamSolomid,3cm65f,CrAzzYmrBC,5,Thu Jul 9 01:04:42 2015 UTC,"They must lane swap I feel, unless TSM gets Kalista, which is unlikely. Quas isn't the best at 1v2, and TSM's bot lane will fall behind TL's, regardless who the ADC is."
TeamSolomid,3cm65f,suicidalmoouky,2,Thu Jul 9 01:13:15 2015 UTC,"I think the Sunday part is very specific as he's asking for the tickets to invite friends to show up on Sunday. That leads me to believe it's a rotation of Turtle Saturday, Keith Sunday.   man i'm just not a fan of them with kalista. Seems like Wildturtle just isn't good with her. Curious about Keith though..."
TeamSolomid,3cm65f,CrAzzYmrBC,3,Thu Jul 9 08:22:26 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say Turtle isn't good specifically with kalista, I think it mainly depends on his current form.   In the first few weeks of this split he was bad with every ad carry, including Kalista, having that infamous match against GV, but, since Keith, arrived he's been the opposite, and played flawlessly against T8, with Kalista.  Although I agree that if he's playing bad it shows more with Kalista than with any other ad carry who has an escape or a spell shield, but I hope those days are behind him."
TeamSolomid,3cm65f,Marco_Brolo_,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:16:21 2015 UTC,I feel the same way.
TeamSolomid,3cm65f,aznanimedude,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:03:18 2015 UTC,"play lane bullies   I wish they did more of this as a team. We see Dyrus having pretty good success on Gnar/Maokai (I think) which are basically top lane bullies in this meta (my top lane knowledge is limited so idk if rumble is or not), Bjergsen tends to be able to carry and shotcall better when having won his lane (please stay off of ezreal and other weak laners that scale - flashback to cho'gath), and because of this I think bot lane would stand to benefit if they can do more than break even.   It can be argued that if top and mid can both win, then having a bot lane that at least has a mid game power spike is more useful than an early game lane that falls off until late, even if that type of lane is an insurance policy for if mid/top can't carry.   thoughts? I can't think about more than this right now."
TeamSolomid,3cm65f,ZirGsuz,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:10:30 2015 UTC,"still?  i mean i'd understand it in the past because Piglet was super frustrated/new-ish, was struggling and Keith was doing super well  maybe because Keith is also trolly and Piglet is known for his reputation as a super serious practice addict?"

TeamSolomid,3cm65f,madbassist,2,Thu Jul 9 01:36:46 2015 UTC,Seems quite likely that last week Keith got the easier team and Turtle the tougher and this week they reverse. I wouldnt have been surprised if Keith got both games this weekend though.

TeamSolomid,3cm65f,AdvancedWin,4,Thu Jul 9 07:24:15 2015 UTC,Not possible. The game right now can't be strategized around an ADC. Completely different lanes. ADC meta has a very limited style compared to mid lane so I doubt it.
TeamSolomid,3cm65f,Daruken,1 point,Thu Jul 9 09:56:38 2015 UTC,"To add on to that, ADC and support are the hardest to swap, as they require synergy with each other, which is difficult to maintain while having to play with 2 people"

TeamSolomid,3cmnlv,ComeOnHer,2,Thu Jul 9 06:15:23 2015 UTC,"Honestly surprised by Keiths DPM being nearly 600 in the TDK game. People hated on the game saying he wasnt outputting enough damage. Doesn't look like it. Didn't even look like it in game.  Thats honestly something that comes up with Keith quite a bit, is a lot of games he outputs high amounts of damage and you just wonder how? It didn't look like he was doing that much.  (Speaking on his time with TL). There was a game he played Corki against TSM, went 10/2/10 iirc, and Turtle was 16/2/4 or something like that on jinx.  The shocking thing was watching that game and seeing how much damage Turtle was doing He got one penta and shoulda had a 2nd by Dyrone stole the penta.  Keith didnt look like he was outputting that much damage, they won tho.  And Keith beat everyone on either team in damage dealt to champions.  Dude has some damage voodooo"

TeamSolomid,3cmnlv,Threemor,3,Thu Jul 9 14:16:00 2015 UTC,Back in the first season of LCS (Spring Split 2013) Riot would sometimes have an EU caster come over to cast a week and have a NA caster go over to Europe to cast a week. It was kinda like a special week type deal. Pretty sure they stopped doing that after the first split but I could be wrong
TeamSolomid,3cmnlv,Azeriel,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:16:55 2015 UTC,"I was really surprised by Keith doing that much damage in the TDK game. But ADC isn't TSM's only problem. We could easily see that in the GV game where they got outpicked and outplayed the entire game.  Ezreal works wonders, but isn't Bjergsen supposed to play a champion that can get ganks, snowball, make plays and carry? As Ezreal you need to play passive. I don't think the pick suits TSM's style just because Runeglaive Ezreal is super OP right now.  ENTIRE TSM played passive. I feel like when TSM calls the passive call, they are giving up TOO much for free. They gave away all the dragons uncontested, they never took an opportunity to fight when they could have, and so on.  I feel like getting a upgrade at ADC (Either it will be WT stepping up or Keith replacing WT) will not solve every problem. The problem lies a lot in the shotcalling and the talking that is done in game. Which brings back the Bjergsen super-carry question, as he is also the shotcaller. (I am not bashing on Bjergsen by any means, he is a wonderuful mid-laner, but imagine if he had the shotcalling of Yellowstar. Think about how much better TSM would have done)  Because, lets be real. TSM is no near the level of play needed to be a powerhouse in worlds. If we just think how SKT T1 would have performed against TDK. It would be a stomp. They would dive their toplane at level 4, made sick plays around dragon, HEAVILY outrotating them etc. TSM is no near this level of rotations, shotcalling and knowing what to do in every situation.   This is something the analyst (can't remember his name, I am sorry) and Loco have to work with the upcoming weeks. Struggeling against TDK and losing vs GV (getting rekd actually) is not something that should be happening if TSM are aiming to be a powerhouse in Worlds.   I am really excited to see the next TSM legends. Amazing show. And I really hope Loco is able to fix the problems, because as of right now, there is A LOT that needs fixing."

I think his rather... forward personality makes it difficult for him follow though. I hope we get to play GV in a best of series someday. They've snagged wins off TSM twice by countering the composition.
TeamSolomid,3cqrgz,sixburgh7,3,Fri Jul 10 00:48:37 2015 UTC,If TSM were to look to pick up another jungler in the offseason it would be Meteos. I just do not see them going after Kikis.
TeamSolomid,3cqrgz,manslayer22,0,Fri Jul 10 00:57:54 2015 UTC,I also thought Meteos would be a good pickup but I think his playstyle clashes with Bjergsen's too much as in Meteos' prime a lot of gold was funneled into him and I feel TSM is too mid centric for that to work out. But maybe that's what we need to change our playstyle out of relying on Bjerg to snowball and carry.
TeamSolomid,3cqrgz,MiniiNinja,4,Fri Jul 10 01:03:43 2015 UTC,Nope. I want Santorin

TeamSolomid,3cllzd,bananakma,2,Wed Jul 8 22:44:54 2015 UTC,I think the uniform as a whole looks really dull compared to many of the other teams. I agree that they should experiment a bit and try and create an image that really makes people think TSM.

For armada his mechanics and punish game mind boggle me, which was why his peach was so scary because he could punish so hard and it translates to fox just as much.  And for HBox it's because of his spacing game that makes his puff work.  that being said we'll see and i'm excited to see how the tournament goes because if there's one thing about Mang0 he has shown that when things matter he can step up but definitely competition is fierce"

TeamSolomid,3chvq7,multres,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:18:05 2015 UTC,"If you count not watching much LCK and LPL as bias. I should have clarified, most of the movement I'm talking about comes between NA and EU after an international. Also I have no idea where you get the idea I'm biased from, I never said I think TSM should be 10th or w.e, just that international tournaments swing the placements towards NA or EU extremely hard with no real movement until another international comes.  Also, seriously? I have to keep editing my comment because every time I reread yours I have to double take. Since EDG won MSI, they have shown some weakness in china, where SKT has completely dominated their own region. SKT is probably the stronger team. As for WE and KOO, seriously dude? No really, do you even hear yourself? WE had a MIRACLE run at MSI, and have since gone back to china where they are bottom. Meanwhile KOO have gotten over that poor performance and are having good showings in korea. I guess I needed to spell out for you that there would be some differences, implying it isn't enough."

Lack of preparation and tunnel on ez.   Gravity beat the fck out of us. Besides, even if we went 1-1, GV still beat us this time of the season, so theyve gotten better. I don't question the Rankings one bit for NA."
TeamSolomid,3chvq7,iChoke,3,Wed Jul 8 03:01:16 2015 UTC,Don't forget these rankings are WEEKLY  And this week Gravity looked WAY better in both their games than TSM when they had arguably the harder week vs #5 and #1 as opposed to TSM who played #10 and #2
TeamSolomid,3cjlkc,kyubez,29,Wed Jul 8 12:32:23 2015 UTC,"I dunno about that, that seems to extreme.   To NEVER make a decision off of poor performance is a bit extreme, and so is constantly making roster swaps.  TSMs problem, is to perform internationally they need step ups in the side lanes.  Dyrus, took the challenge like a man and stepped the fuck up and is currently doing very well. Ready for Koro1 or Marin right now? Probably not. But hes atleast adressing his issues and stepping up.  Turtle, hasn't. Soon Rosters will be locked before worlds, and then... if the Turtle eating 1,000 hooks. Or Turtle doing the least damage of any starting adc while being on a top tier team if they didnt make the Keith move now you cant make it here soon.  TSM will never make it out of groups. (And its worth noting, Keith may not be the answer either... But its worth it to Try and develop him and see)  Its not like they are even being unfair in their approach either. They are giving Turtle every chance to earn his job, he earns it and its his.  I actually really like this setup, and believe most, if not all teams should approach something like this. Hell how nice would it be to have 10 Team members, 2 for each role and just have open competition.  Competition brings out the best of your talent.  And what TSM needs... is that other carry. No clue if Turtle or Keith will be that guy this year. But I think its worth it to try.  TSM can not rely on the Bjergsen show at worlds. They just can't. Think about how good TSM could be if they had ""The other guy"" the guy that teams have to think about ""Holy shit if i go too hard going for Bjergsen X player is going to wreck my fucking year."""
TeamSolomid,3cjlkc,lurkedlongtime,3,Wed Jul 8 13:07:42 2015 UTC,"TSM can not rely on the Bjergsen show at worlds. They just can't. Think about how good TSM could be if they had ""The other guy"" the guy that teams have to think about ""Holy shit if i go too hard going for Bjergsen X player is going to wreck my fucking year.""   I feel like they never give a chance to develop the side laners though. They always pick a mid focused comp and funnel their resources into Bjergsen. I guess because it's always worked in the NA region they've had no reason to change their strategy. Like you said though, if they want to beat international teams they need to give carry roles to the other players and leave Bjerg to fend on his own for once. While I'll say now's the time to do it since they've pretty much guaranteed a spot in playoffs this uncertain situation with Turtle and Kieth isn't helping them. They need to pick a starting ADC soon and stick with it instead of alternating every week to get as much practice and experience in as possible in developing side lane carries."
TeamSolomid,3cjlkc,ilsime,4,Wed Jul 8 14:58:20 2015 UTC,If I could give more upvotes I would. I agree 100%. I think what we're all hoping is that Keith is the fire under Turtle that gets him back to that Wild Cat he really is.
TeamSolomid,3cjlkc,Quizmaster119,6,Wed Jul 8 13:13:12 2015 UTC,"I don't think all of us necessarily want WT to stay on the starting roster, even if he improves a little... meaning only if he completely returns to his earlier form would I want him to stay. To me, Keith represents an opportunity for TSM to grow, and WT an anchor that holds TSM back from improving. Dyrus doesn't have this ""liability"" - to me he seems like despite all odds he is improving very very well. But I'd rather see where Keith takes us, as much as I love WT and his beautiful personality."
TeamSolomid,3cjlkc,Marco_Brolo_,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:17:45 2015 UTC,But if Wildturtle ends up playing better than Keith by the end of the split why would we chose Keith over him?
TeamSolomid,3cjlkc,suicidalmoouky,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:24:44 2015 UTC,in that scenario I still think Keith should be brought along as a sub for worlds. WT should be kept as long as he is doing not just better than Keith but good enough. If he isn't good enough than maybe giving Keith experience is worth putting in WT a little bit less...  Basically we can use them both in any scenario! lol
TeamSolomid,3cjlkc,Marco_Brolo_,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:40:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I hope they keep Keith aswell, even as a sub in case Turtle outperforms him at the end of the split. Would be good for both of them I think."
TeamSolomid,3cjlkc,suicidalmoouky,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:26:06 2015 UTC,Basically TSM must win NA if they ever dream of getting out of groupstage at worlds.
TeamSolomid,3cjlkc,katnizz,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:25:59 2015 UTC,TSM needs to be doing what Fnatic is doing to get out of groupstage. Not stomping teams in a weaker region is a bad sign when SKT is stomping teams in a much stronger region.
TeamSolomid,3cjlkc,llshuxll,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:32:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah unfortunately that's not happening. If TSM wins NA then they won't have to face SKT, EDG, and Fnatic in groupstage, which will significantly improve TSM's chances of getting out of groupstage (which is still isn't very high.

But it wasn't directly a ""you're slacking so we're replacing you"" sort of thing  it was more of a ""your attitude is ruining the team environment, which will harm our performance because now you're affecting other people"" sort of thing.  I.e. they didn't bench based on your performance itself, but your effect on team performance.  Like Chaox was churting team dynamic and clashing with Regi, Xpecial was being passive agressive and again hurting environment, and Gleeb was kind of underperforming but again he had what was discovered as bipolar disorder and was also in his behavior causing an awkward atmosphere in the gaming house"
TeamSolomid,3cjlkc,Aceekay,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:34:15 2015 UTC,"I fell in love with the team because of Dyrus and I grew to love everyone else but if someone isn't playing up to standards than I understand that they should improve or be replaced for the better of the team.  I know it hurts to have someone you like replaced but TSM desperately needs a second carry, especially on the international stage. And right now I don't think Dyrus (even though he's been playing much better this split I would like to see him perform on a carry top laner for once) or WT can do that right now."
TeamSolomid,3cjlkc,Bille99,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:37:48 2015 UTC,From what I've heard the main reason they're bringing Keith in to try him out is to get Turtle to step up his game and take it a bit more seriously.

TeamSolomid,3cc3x5,Badbaseball,20,Mon Jul 6 19:26:17 2015 UTC,Honestly I felt like TSM was just fking around with a new comp this week similar to the week they played ekko twice. Gravity planned against it very well but this is not the best play style TSM has because ez has so little presence in the early game.  I'm not extra worried because of this week.  I actually felt the loss to gravity and the issues with TDK were great learning experiences for how they should play when bjerg can't out pressure in mid.  Hopefully TSM can grow from this.  I'm honestly a bit concerned about how worlds will go for NA but for now I'm just looking for TSM to improve and get hot come playoffs.
TeamSolomid,3cc3x5,akim1026,3,Mon Jul 6 19:59:46 2015 UTC,"yeah i feel like they were fking around too - just taking the ezreal pick because no one had exploited it yet and they were greedy, and then also they were over confident picking it into a diving composition."
TeamSolomid,3cc3x5,Marco_Brolo_,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:08:28 2015 UTC,"I 100% agreed. Gravity had a comp ready specifically just for TSM ez comp. If you watch the game again, you can see that TSM could literally do nothing"
TeamSolomid,3cc3x5,Bradey,8,Tue Jul 7 15:38:15 2015 UTC,"TSM needs a early game, better vision, better sidelane control, and honestly start calling for some god damn ganks. It is cool to have a farmed jungler but shutting down a lane is so much better. They have no creativity on the team or aggressiveness. I miss Regi's style..."
TeamSolomid,3cc3x5,llshuxll,7,Mon Jul 6 20:15:17 2015 UTC,"What annoys me is that TSM always seem to follow 'it' by the book. Runeglaive Ezreal comes out, everyone jumps on him and that's all we've played since. This doesn't translate 1>1 but if someone keeps throwing a left hook at you it's not going to take you long to throw up your left block and counter with a right. I know some picks are stronger than others but what's wrong with us pulling 'a Keane' and pulling out a J4 Mid ourselves?..... Because it's not in Lord Loco's Notepad, that's why.   120+ champs in League but we play the same ones over and over. All the other teams see this and start laughing."
TeamSolomid,3cc3x5,Helian7,2,Mon Jul 6 23:35:25 2015 UTC,"Because it works in NA. That's all there is too it. In North America a team has never been as outplayed in the draft as TSM was in the game versus Gravity, they didn't expect it at all because no team prepares their draft so well as Gravity did. Probably C9 in their prime had the best drafts and Gravity this game surpassed that."
TeamSolomid,3cc3x5,Snowfog,2,Tue Jul 7 09:13:00 2015 UTC,"I don't think other teams are laughing. I think other teams are trying new strats in order to surprise and compete with TSM.  I wish they would play some off meta stuff too, but that doesn't make them better. It makes them more exciting. There is a big difference. UoL last season wasn't the best team. Gravity this season isn't the best team. But they are two of the most fun to watch.  FNC is a nice mix, but it's because they are aggressive.   If TSM played off meta picks their playstyle would still be farm to 20 and try to snowball. It still would be a boring game to watch. I've been a fan since TRM, and this is the least exciting time in their history I think."
TeamSolomid,3cc3x5,Suspense304,11,Tue Jul 7 15:25:55 2015 UTC,"I think they need to be able to adapt during game. They can't have 1 playstyle and expect it to work everytime. Adapting has been their weakness whether its against champions, enemy teams playstyle or champ build."
TeamSolomid,3cc3x5,saltynerd24,3,Mon Jul 6 20:01:58 2015 UTC,I've personally been wondering where orianna is for TSM. I remember watching worlds and Bjerg on Ori was scary.
TeamSolomid,3cc3x5,Lottapumpkins,3,Mon Jul 6 20:24:40 2015 UTC,Never fear.  Once world's comes around or will be a highly contested pick. As will every champion that has trifold core because you don't deny phreaks influence in the meta
TeamSolomid,3cc3x5,aznanimedude,3,Mon Jul 6 20:29:57 2015 UTC,"The problem with your logic there of thinking this is a systematic failure Is  You won't have the same results replicating it.  Tsm had 4 AP heavy members   Corki is a magic damage adc, of his damage most of if is magic. His autos are the only real physical damage and Corki relies on poking  Annie   Gragas  Gnar is AD sure but he's a tank. And even then his % hp is magic   So it's not gg they built to counter bjerg.  It's more gg they created a comp that didn't warrant the other team to build armor"
TeamSolomid,3cc3x5,lurkedlongtime,3,Mon Jul 6 21:38:21 2015 UTC,"Correct me if I am wrong, but I remember reading on reddit a few weeks ago that TSM is more or less guaranteed to go to worlds at this point, no? At the very least itll be damn hard for them NOT to go. So I wouldn't be surprised if they were just practicing other shit in a non scrim environment to see what might stick in the future."
TeamSolomid,3cc3x5,Tserraknight,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:46:36 2015 UTC,"Basically we have to get 3rd with some team that made playoffs last year in 2nd, then we lose the gauntlet"
TeamSolomid,3cc3x5,AdvancedWin,4,Tue Jul 7 15:54:19 2015 UTC,"I think there were a lot of problems that game but the major one for me was how AP heavy they were. Corki does a lot of magic damage even with an AD build.   Personally, instead of Annie/Corki, I would have went Jinx with Janna/Morgana. Hell, even Nami would have been nice for the sustain against Nid spears.   I'll have to rewatch the pick ban phase to see where they picked the Adc and Support to see how it might have effected Gravity's picks though."
TeamSolomid,3cc3x5,ComeOnHer,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:10:40 2015 UTC,"GV  picked Sivir and Shen  in their first rotation. TSM's  picks were fine if a little non-commital until they picked Ezreal.  They had Gnar/Gragas/Annie/Corki, a decent team for engage and teamfighting,  but not really the greatest team to enable poke,  and with somewhat lacking physical damage.  They were up against Sivir/Maokai/Shen/Nidalee, a team with strong anti poke,   and strong engage, and Keane  still had the option  of going J4. I do think the Ezreal pick was a mistake at that  point.  Contrast that to the  game against TDK where TSM had Sivir  themselves for the disengage, a beefy front line with plenty of CC,  and Thresh for additional peel,  against a team with very limited dive,  and it's easy to see the difference in Ezreal's  usefulness.  It's hard to say if the pick in Sunday's game was chosen from the start and then stubbornly pushed through despite conditions  not being ideal or if TSM  felt that it was the right choice at the time...   either way it's not too concerning  as TSM has shown decent mid-series  adaptation.  Still, a greater emphasis on strategic P/B  would be good."
TeamSolomid,3cc3x5,Bulzeeb,6,Tue Jul 7 03:32:28 2015 UTC,I hate when people overreact to every loss we have. If you have faith in the staff you should understand they know things we dont and they are working super hard for TSM to be an international powerhouse.

TeamSolomid,3cc3x5,ISODAK,2,Wed Jul 8 04:53:55 2015 UTC,"I also noticed Bjergsen tends to play the same champ twice in a week.  Ez, Azir, and Ekko, in the last 3 weeks.  Didn't have the time to look before that.  Maybe other teams are using that to predict Sunday team comps."

I really wouldnt get so stressed after a bad game. I dont think tsm got exploited just got outpicked. Both botlane picks were terrible and gnar couldnt ever get the timing right. They slowly choked out tsm, thats not indicative of any playstyle imo"
TeamSolomid,3cc3x5,Lshrsh,2,Mon Jul 6 23:10:29 2015 UTC,"There's nothing wrong with their playstyle. Gravity's draft as well as their execution yseterday was brillant. Even though smite AP Ezreal is strong, he still has a huge ramp up time. Gravity picked beefy hard engage as well as a champion that is pretty good at taking turrets. You could have put SKT on that composition and they still wouldn't have won that game. GV just really exploited the AP ezreal power trough. TSM got completely out picked. I wasn't even mad after that loss. You have to realize - there was very little TSM could have done in that game due to the Ezreal/Corki picks. It was really poor draft on our part and a good draft + good execution on GV's part."
TeamSolomid,3cc3x5,no_non_sense,2,Tue Jul 7 00:30:56 2015 UTC,"Gravity is an oddball team similar to UOL they aren't afraid to off meta and have confidence in their own abilities to try new strats. TSM play the tried and tested farm up win team fights style. To beat teams like Gravity we have to play similar style they do and just win on our players abilities, shot calling and advantage of enemy mistakes. Don't forget since the beginning TSM has always had a target on its back and every team out there wants to beat them. They will do everything it takes to take a game off TSM. Similar to when TSM stepped up to take on Cloud9 last couple splits. TSM will have several losses every split so its not the end of the world."
TeamSolomid,3cc3x5,pillowmagic,3,Tue Jul 7 03:47:59 2015 UTC,"There's no diversity in their champ select. You know which 3 champs everyone is going to play before the week begins. When has TSM ever pulled something outside the box. How come TSM has never done a Fizz/Yasuo comp like Impulse did. TSM has good shot calling and good individual players. They have the creativity of an 80's robot when it comes to champ select.  You can, in fact, lose the WHOLE game in champ select. That's what happened yesterday. There is no parallel universe in which TSM won that game."
TeamSolomid,3cc3x5,Skitter_Scat,6,Mon Jul 6 21:36:01 2015 UTC,I think TSM knew that Gravity had picked a team comp specifically to counter AP ez. They just picked it anyways to see if they could still win with it. TSM has traditionally never been an innovator but instead a great replicator. They take things that other teams innovate and then improve upon them and work them into their team comps.
TeamSolomid,3cc3x5,Tserraknight,3,Mon Jul 6 23:34:34 2015 UTC,"This too is a great point. It makes me want Bo5's back because that's just how TSM rolled. Let me take your strat, and show you how its done. I miss that. I also miss Shen/Noc/Karthus teams."
TeamSolomid,3cc3x5,pillowmagic,2,Tue Jul 7 03:48:30 2015 UTC,"If TSM ever wants to become great, they need to become an innovator. Innovation shows an ability to think about the game in the abstract and come up with creative solutions to problems."
TeamSolomid,3cc3x5,Skitter_Scat,2,Tue Jul 7 05:39:43 2015 UTC,"I disagree. All it takes is one team one game to innovate. After that it's all about adaption. TSM is good at adapting (game to game, just look at their bo5 play which us amazing) innovation is risky and doesn't take a good team to do. If it works that team gets a free win basically. If it doesn't they get nothing. A good team perfects. TSM takes ideas that other people  come up with and make them the own and hone them. Its how TSM has always been and if you look at the top teams you'll see that there are very few innovators at the top. Gravity is like the only example. Uol is an innovator too. But neither of those teams have won a split. Uol came close. And gravity is a contender this split but neither have won and while I think they've got a good shot this split I still think tsm will be able to out adapt in a bo5.  Innovators excel at bo1s. Perfecters excel at adapting in a bo5. Since bo5'S are what matters, high level play will always favor teams more like tsm"
TeamSolomid,3cc3x5,Rikiia,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:20:51 2015 UTC,While I agree with this in general what happens when BO1 becomes important again? I'm thinking mainly of well...MSI I guess.
TeamSolomid,3cc3x5,Skitter_Scat,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:56:49 2015 UTC,Well TSM does decently enough in bo1's. We got out of groups at world's last year. We won IEM. MSI was a poor performance but I think at that point in time tsm was lax. Dyrus has been improving as has wildturtle. I don't think they took MSI seriously enough. I think they'll show up again around worlds.

Faker can play almost anything and do well with it. He's such a strong player it doesn't matter. Additionally I don't think it's skt'S innovation that is winning them games. Whereas with gravity it definitely is a major part of them winning games (not saying it's cheesy, it's just one of their strengths)."

They are great at adapting in between games. Adapting in game is very hard because a lot of the game is decided in picks and bans. And if you don't have the champions to counter a a surprise champion or innovative  strategy in game you're out of luck until the next game. But tsm us good at adapting in between games."

TeamSolomid,3cc3x5,geldin,2,Wed Jul 8 09:41:22 2015 UTC,"I agree with basically everything.  When TSM is challenged, TSM rises to the occasion, at least domestically.  We saw last year that when they were challenged in playoffs that they played way tighter than they did in the season and held their own at Worlds.  Around the time of IEM Katowice, they were running neck-and-neck with CLG and C9 and had a great showing there.  After stomping spring playoffs, they had a mediocre show at MSI.  I think and sincerely hope they're being challenged right now, because that only bodes well for them at Worlds."
TeamSolomid,3cc3x5,unchartedcubes,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:39:49 2015 UTC,"To be fair, any team that stack resistances and manages to get late enough in the game is going to win. That is the thing with mid lane Ezreal, his early game is non-existent. Gravity did a great job by stack MR early to stop the late game monster that is AP EZ. I think it is more of a problem on the mid lane pick more than anything.   Not to discredit, Gravity. They exploited and had that J4 pick preped and ready, obviously. GGWP to GV."
TeamSolomid,3cc3x5,FoxyMayhem,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:53:02 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind they were almost entirely AP. Corki is mixed, annie support, gragas, AP Ez. Only Gnar was AD, but he was mostly tank (using thornmail, which does AP).  TSM's team comp was asking for the hard MR counter. Add the lifesteal counter on top, and they just champ selected themselves into a hole. Gravity just pushed the dirt in."
TeamSolomid,3cc3x5,TubbyMcChubby,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:08:51 2015 UTC,"I'v been wondering when Dyrus was going to start playing hard carries. It's no secret that top lane has more of an impact in terms of damage (Huni). Dyrus has been playing Rumble in LCS, and played a TON of Yasuo top lane on his smurf. I wouldn't be surprised if we see Dyrus going Yasuo top lane. This would stop the problem of Bjergsen doing almost all of the team's dps."
TeamSolomid,3cc3x5,abarus,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:14:02 2015 UTC,"Couching staff came up with a bad team comp. Pretty all AP / mix damage is the reason the team fail so badly. No reason to get Armor because of the corki pick, they should have pick up a different ADC or top lane with AD scaling damage.   TSM again world and MSI has more to do with TSM trying to take away what other team is good at, more than making sure they play what they are good with. If TSM play what they are good with, balance team comp, they have good enough skill to win again any team world wide. Problem is TSM try to out think other team hurt themselves more than they hurt other team.  TSM ban out all top lane ban, doesn't make a different what make a different what huni plays, he still do well, but give wide open field of choices so will dyrus well enough.  TSM need to play there way, don't second guess themselves. Mid game using over flood warding on the side of the map they want to control, like learn from Samsung teams. They will be strong enough to punish other team for be over aggressive."
TeamSolomid,3cc3x5,Dameon574,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:05:47 2015 UTC,At MSI TSM got a list of picks they thought were S tier and would win against anyone. They had practiced these picks extensively. They got those set of Champions consistently.  They were slapped around a bit and sent home while the big boys innovated and perfected the meta. I don't think you can say with certainty that TSM needs to focus solely on what their picks are.
TeamSolomid,3cc3x5,Zandari,0,Thu Jul 9 13:09:49 2015 UTC,"While I don't think it is wrong that TSM plays around Bjergsen   Who else would they play around? Are people still in denial about WT? He does no damage, that is a fact with stats. TSM need a 2nd carry, not Keith, an import."

TeamSolomid,3cb2ev,Gaulrik,7,Mon Jul 6 15:58:49 2015 UTC,"The reason gravity and TIP are looking strong is because they have playmakers like Rush and Move, not passive junglers. Not saying Santorin is bad, but he plays way too passive when he shouldn't. I've seen him in solo queue play much more aggressive and carry oriented. While it's fine to have him play passive, it just seems odd because TSM doesn't really have any playmakers like teams like FNC do. It just seems like when TSM lose it's because they just slowly lose control because they aren't willing to make plays that could win or lose them a game."

TeamSolomid,3cb2ev,akim1026,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:18:11 2015 UTC,"Lanes feed Santorin information, Santorin I'm sure is in charge of some vision control and to adapt his pathing based on input from teammates. He may also be in charge of buff timers.  Your post sounds very critical of Santorin, I'm not sure if you meant it that way but I hope not. Junglers often have many different directions they can go and it's not as easy to optimize pathing so you are in the right place at the right time while minimizing wasted time running through jungle without farming."
TeamSolomid,3cb2ev,manslayer22,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:33:28 2015 UTC,"I am sorry if it seems critical of Santorin I really dont mean it.  Basically what am I asking is, should laners be responsible for calling ganks or should it be junglers? (lets say feeding information is done either way)"
TeamSolomid,3cb2ev,akim1026,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:47:03 2015 UTC,"Ideally it would be both. Laners should tell Santorin that their lane is open for a gank, but Santorin should also tell the laners that he is going to the lane because he believes enemy jungler is down there as well."
TeamSolomid,3cb2ev,aznanimedude,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:52:54 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think in an ideal situation, the laner should be the one to call for it. You can see how the wave is shoving and how volatile the lane is and you have a better shot of knowing where the ward coverage is so feeding that to the jungler and maybe deciding together based on that information how to set up ganks is the best. Jungler can set up for counter gank if he knows where enemy jungle is going to go."

And being at the top of the standings now, as well as getting to quarters in 2014 and winning Katowice, made me rest easy and trust it.   But watching Legends, the ""everyone gets a job"" experiment sounds 1/2 great and 1/2 terrible in theory.   On one hand it should let an individual be good at one thing, and it will also help identify mistakes in retrospect so they can (hopefully) be prevented in the future. Also, it could help provide a clear role in the team for the switching marksmen. But on the other hand, it hinders the ability to deal with the unpredictable when you are only training for the basics, and it creates a habit where each player will only do what they can, and not try their A game.  It's really up to the results the system shows and lately they've been shaky at best... so i don't know for sure what's going on."
TeamSolomid,3c8q7e,Marco_Brolo_,7,Sun Jul 5 23:58:02 2015 UTC,"I'm still banking on the theory that TSM has intentionally played poorly and lost from MSI on so that other teams don't prepare as much against them.   Yeah, definitely that...  I hope... please..."

TeamSolomid,3c8q7e,Marco_Brolo_,3,Mon Jul 6 02:42:59 2015 UTC,"The thing is TSM is a meta team. So we can only play the things that the meta says its good. For example: Huni playing cassio, we never saw it coming, we never would be able to pull it. What i am trying to say poorly, since english isn't my thing, is that we do not set the meta in NA. So we are not like any top team in other regions (IDK about China actually) that sets the meta. If we look to EU and Korea we can see the top teams pulling some crazy shit like SKT with Master yi and UOL with the Varus mid (last split). We should be able to set the meta and that what made me kinda upset with the coaching staff. Loco said something like ""You'll be playing only what we say you should play"" and thats for me a statement that we will be only playing the meta. I do not like it."
TeamSolomid,3c8q7e,Theis159,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:27:14 2015 UTC,"The reason they do this is that if they can't even master what is known to be strong, how can they be innovative?  i think regi said that somewhere when he was talking about coast back when zion was in it. but yes i agree with you 100%. mastering the meta is important but i dont like how tsm limits themselves to it. they got the box well filled, but i think its time for them to think outside of it for once."
TeamSolomid,3c8q7e,kyubez,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:00:00 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say ""ingame"" adaptations are non existant, I've seen TSM play a few games this season when they were playing from behind, which was surely not in their plans, and did it well. They also managed to win some games in which they were in tough situations.  Also, not sure about the over coaching thing. I mean, let's not forget TSM may have some less clean games, but overall they've been pretty dominant. For example, let's take a look into the games they lost: against C9 they were winning, but made a silly mistake and died from Rumble's ultimate; against DIG, if I recall correctly, they were losing, then came back nicely, and then threw the lead; and against GV (which is a very good team) they got baited into picking Ezereal, and thus outpicked (for the first time in the season) and finally outplayed.  The rest of the games, either TSM played pretty well, or even if the games weren't going so well they managed to win them through their tactical or mechanical play.   Sure they make a few mistakes and they're far from being perfect, but I don't think it's wise to point out a single aspect and then make a general conclusion like ""Locodoco is over coaching TSM"".   And when I say this I'm not talking about this thread in particular; every time TSM has a bad game people will complain about the whining in r/leagueoflegends towards the team but, in the meantime, there's always 4 or 5 threads in this subreddit that will immediately start questioning Loco's, Santorin's and even Lustboy's competence. I mean, calm down people, we're probably still gonna win the split anyway. It's just one game."
TeamSolomid,3c8q7e,suicidalmoouky,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:55:03 2015 UTC,"TSM is using these times to test out different strategies and give the players a taste of what they might be able to pull of. Extend their strategy pool. It isn't that strange of a tactic for top teams, they do fucked up shit because they know overall they are in an okay spot.   For instance when I played football we had a coach obsessed with fucking with teams. People would watch each other's tapes from a previous game and the team would see us running a shit to the right side of the field, that's all you did run to the right. Then randomly bam switch the quaterback or something halfway through a game (you're already winning) and do some passing plays. The opposing team will have to adjust.   Our school was big as fuck though, like we only had 10th/11th/12th in that school and still a graduating class was about 3.5k~ depending on the year. So we had the player pool to switch strategies and players up for that stuff."
TeamSolomid,3c8q7e,Deft_Rabbit,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:24:57 2015 UTC,"SKT definitely pulls out some insane shit in LCK, so there's proof of teams doing this. Today however, was just another instance of TSM accidently putting together a comp too heavy on one damage type. They've done this before against Gravity sadly.   Altho I agree with testing stuff as you go, I think it should be a more generalized sense for players and their gameplay alone/together. Patches will always change specific comps so prolly no point practicing a ""broken"" AP Ez comp that will probably be gone next patch...and doesn't seem all that reliable anyways."

Wouldnt be surprised if something like this happened every week.  Edit 2: Keith commented on it, said that its ""too risky"" for him to play on twitter, he had to use old gear from his TL days. He didnt know that would be the case. TL used Razer gear, TSM uses logitech. Practiced with logitech with TSM, had 5 mins notice before finding out he had to use his Razer gear again.

TeamSolomid,3c8cv1,ThatGingerGuy69,3,Sun Jul 5 21:21:00 2015 UTC,"Turtle lost lane (in cs) to his lane opponent.  He is playing team fights better than before, and I do accredit a large factor of this game to being out drafted but turtle is supposed to be known for his dominant lane phase.  Turtle has been a liability in the lane phase, going even at best to the opponent, even losing a lot without jungle pressure.  I'm not saying keith is the answer or that turtle is bad, but he has been under performing for a while now"
TeamSolomid,3c8cv1,dglucky,3,Sun Jul 5 22:18:56 2015 UTC,Oh I know. Ever since xpecial left he has lost lane every time with or without jungle pressure.

Except casters say Wildturtle was caught and the rest of TSM played well to protect corki while also saying jarvan didn't use his EQ to catch corki when clearly he did but turtle flashed it.

Got down voted continuously every time I commented and then watched a 1 kill ezreal dominate today.  But on topic. They went crazy when Turtle escaped without dying. They praise him when he does something good, but honestly he didn't do anything good this game, he was invisible and so was everyone else for the most part."

TeamSolomid,3c4hwx,EastRicee,4,Sat Jul 4 18:22:37 2015 UTC,and the first American major won by one of what is known as “The Five Gods” since EVO 2007.    Something seems odd with this statement....
TeamSolomid,3c4hwx,kyugi0923,6,Sat Jul 4 20:03:13 2015 UTC,"I tried to make it a little more understandable with some extra information and links if anyone is interested in leffen's performances.  For the last 8 years, no one outside of the top 5 players has been able to win a big national. The top 5 are often called 'The gods of melee' because of how incredible they were compared to everyone else.  CEO 2015 came around recently, and while leffen was looking a little shaky day one, he played absolutely amazing and made a dominating performance, some of the best melee I've ever seen on day 2. If any of you are interested in watching the grand finals of CEO its right here This was an important win, because it was his first US national he's won.  Also if you're interested Beast 5 was leffen first national win pre TSM. (It's an amazing 15 minute set that I encourage everyone to watch if they are interested in melee.  Sorry if I babbled on, i'm a huge leffen and TSM fan, so getting anyone interested would be awesome."
TeamSolomid,3c4hwx,Giggity0,3,Sat Jul 4 20:56:19 2015 UTC,"But didn't the statement say that this is the first American major won by one of the 5Gods since EVO 2007? I thought that Leffen isn't one of the 5 gods, and has none of the 5gods won since EVO2007?"
TeamSolomid,3c4hwx,kyugi0923,3,Sat Jul 4 21:11:17 2015 UTC,It´s a mistake. No one except the 5 gods won a big tournament since 2007.

TeamSolomid,3c4062,JarBarSteve,5,Sat Jul 4 17:18:04 2015 UTC,"People seem to forget that santorin was insanely good last split and he isnt playing that bad right now either, hes a very solid jungler, and considering hes extremely young AND THIS IS HIS SECOND FUCKING SPLIT he has done a great job overall"

I feel as though he plays to whatever caliber Bjerg or not lane do. I don't think he'll ever carry a game, but he also won't be in the way."
TeamSolomid,3c4062,Vetersova,2,Sat Jul 4 18:30:31 2015 UTC,"I thought the same but not really, maybe Regi is a time traveller from MSI"
TeamSolomid,3c4062,Zellough,0,Sat Jul 4 16:24:16 2015 UTC,Yeah it seemed super random that he just tweeted that out of nowhere lol I mean yeah Santorin is being hated on by some but its not like its recent news.
TeamSolomid,3c4062,kyugi0923,3,Sat Jul 4 16:25:58 2015 UTC,I think the key about Santorin is that he's ONLY 18 years old. The kid hasn't even hit his prime yet and he's imo top 5 jungler in the west.
TeamSolomid,3c4062,AZF1,2,Sat Jul 4 22:17:18 2015 UTC,"Why does everyone assume that Santorin can't get better? There's a lot of players, even in OGN that had their fix of problems before becoming top tier players in the world. I remember players like GBM and Marin were incredibly underwhelming in a lot of their games when they were still in their first season of playing professionally. I'm not saying that Santorin is going to be guaranteed the next S2 Diamond or S3 Insec, but don't count out a guy that is still very much new to the scene. I don't think the jungling role is something as simple as plug and play, especially for a rookie."
TeamSolomid,3c4062,beaniebees,7,Sat Jul 4 18:04:10 2015 UTC,"Santorin is a total 180 from what Amazing was. Amazing was a high activity, high pressure jungler. Amazing's problems were in teamfighting, however. Santorin is okay in teamfighting, but he's also not particularly active (this is pretty much an indisputable fact).  TSM claimed to learn a lot about how to use their jungler effectively at Season 4 World's, when they bootcamped with the Korean teams. It seems that knowledge is either lost or outdated since Amazing's departure, to be terrible honest."
TeamSolomid,3c4062,ZirGsuz,6,Sat Jul 4 16:01:25 2015 UTC,You're forgetting Amazing's inability to play more than 2-3 champions well last season. Which has not been a problem whatsoever for Santorin.
TeamSolomid,3c4062,apdermond,11,Sat Jul 4 16:03:11 2015 UTC,"Are we forgetting that up until worlds only 2-3 junglers were ever played? And I recall him having 5 champs to play around playoffs (Lee sin, Elise, Nunu, Kha'zix, Jarvan IV)  EDIT: He had very limited success on anything besides the 2-3 (Lee sin Elise)  See below... thanks /u/apdermond"
TeamSolomid,3c4062,Marco_Brolo_,14,Sat Jul 4 16:07:30 2015 UTC,You're forgetting Volibear.

TeamSolomid,3c4062,BigMagic,5,Sat Jul 4 17:07:10 2015 UTC,People discredit his nunu because he got outsmited once on nunu
TeamSolomid,3c4062,aznanimedude,3,Sat Jul 4 16:26:10 2015 UTC,"In the regular season, he only really had success on Lee Sin and Elise (going 15-3). Once you banned his Lee Sin and Elise, and forced him onto other junglers, the team went 1-9. It was a problem.  In the playoffs, he added Nunu, which is why they had more success.  At worlds, he went back to only playing Lee Sin all but once, and they did well in groups. Versus SSW, they banned or took Lee every game."
TeamSolomid,3c4062,apdermond,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:10:27 2015 UTC,He played J4 in the game they won against SSW
TeamSolomid,3c4062,x3nics,3,Sat Jul 4 23:42:52 2015 UTC,"The circumstances of the game matters though. SSW also fought at lvl 1 with a much worse team comp (Kass Mundo Khazix Trist Morg vs Thresh Ryze Lucian Yasuo J4) and TSM started 2-0 before minions spawned. Then fought a 4v5 (without their adc) at dragon to make it 5-1 with a 3/0/2 Lucian. To credit that game as proof that Amazing had success with J4 is a little silly.  And he went 1-4 before that. He had very little success with the champion overall. They banned Lee Sin 3 times and took it themselves the 4th game which led to a pretty convincing 3-1 series win. He wasn't the sole reason they lost, but he was a large part of it."
TeamSolomid,3c4062,apdermond,6,Sun Jul 5 00:23:14 2015 UTC,No one played more than 2-3 champs in the jungle within a given patch with the exception of KaKAO and Chinese Junglers.  KaKAO had to because he was the primary carry for his team and he was a jungler. China does whatever they want because god bless.
TeamSolomid,3c4062,ZirGsuz,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:23:40 2015 UTC,"It might have been a slight issue, but what I liked about him was him being active. The jungler needs to be active, when you have a reactive jungler like Santorin it's quite bad. As an enemy jungler it's quite easy to tell Santorins jungle pathing where he will be in the map.  Yeah it may pass for now, but at higher level competition it will be a big problem."
TeamSolomid,3c4062,-Acerin,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:05:48 2015 UTC,No other jungler was forced to not play lee sin eve and elise with the exception rengar and nunu.

TeamSolomid,3c4062,Riykee,-1,Sat Jul 4 21:10:51 2015 UTC,"You think teams just randomly decided to pick on solely Amazing but not other junglers? What is your reasoning for that then?  I'm confused as how this is even up for debate. His limited champion pool was an admitted problem by TSM last year. It's not like I'm coming up with some new analysis, this was a general consensus."

TeamSolomid,3c1occ,JaysusMoon,10,Sat Jul 4 03:57:27 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I guess it's going to take at least a few more weeks for us to know who TSM wants to use for playoffs/worlds. I hope their final decision would be Turtle, but there is no way of knowing anytime soon."
TeamSolomid,3c1occ,FatTeemo,4,Sat Jul 4 02:15:45 2015 UTC,"I know on /r/lol it may be an unpopular opinion, but just like what Dyrus said in the previous episode, I think Turtle's skill ceiling is higher than any ADC in NA. I still feel it may take the perfect storm of Turtle performing out of his mind, and Keith playing poorly for him to keep his starting spot though"
TeamSolomid,3c1occ,Kumdogmillionaire,6,Sat Jul 4 04:47:01 2015 UTC,"Unless I missed it, they don't really mention the idea of alternating Turtle and Keith as a long term plan. Seems like by playoffs or so they are going to pick one of the two and stick with them? I was under the impression that this could turn into an SKT situation where we can use whichever player we feel is best for a certain game, but that doesn't seem to be the plan for TSM. Maybe it's just assumed that this is a possibility IDK. However, I'm now much more nervous about Turtle's chances of staying on the roster as a starter. It almost kinda seems as if they plan on going with Keith regardless of how Turtle performs in a way... Or at least that was the feel I got."
TeamSolomid,3c1occ,jdw142,8,Fri Jul 3 23:47:08 2015 UTC,"Rotating Turtle and Keith was never a possibility I think, especially it is ADC position and how LCS system works. And yes they will most likely pick 1 of the 2 as starter, and it should be before playoffs. And yes I do agree with you that Turtle's chances are looking grimmer and grimmer."
TeamSolomid,3c1occ,jdw142,4,Fri Jul 3 23:49:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree with you as well. Sucks because Turtle is my favorite member being an adc main myself, but still interested to see how Keith performs tomorrow. His laning phase was his weakest point when he was on TL so I'll be keeping a close eye on how the early stages of the game goes if we don't lane swap."
TeamSolomid,3c1occ,Kumdogmillionaire,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:54:10 2015 UTC,Basically the only thing that will keep Turtle as starter is if on stage Keith just completely shits the bed
TeamSolomid,3c1occ,JaysusMoon,3,Sat Jul 4 04:44:15 2015 UTC,"That SKT method honestly doesn't work as well in NA in a Bo1 format. But anyhow, they wouldn't get rid of Keith. Turtle may retire if Keith goes to worlds, but they wouldn't let go of Keith if Turtle does. Loco was going on about how much potential Keith has."
TeamSolomid,3c1occ,jdw142,5,Fri Jul 3 23:53:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, some of the comments and things said in the video made me feel like the were prepping us for Turtle being removed and Keith stepping in permanently."
TeamSolomid,3c1occ,suicidalmoouky,3,Fri Jul 3 23:55:21 2015 UTC,"They also said the best ad carry would stay, though, so it's all a matter of who's the best by the end of the split. It can certainly be turtle."
TeamSolomid,3c1occ,JaysusMoon,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:04:17 2015 UTC,"It's certainly possible. And despite any bias we may have, if he's performing better than Turtle it's preferable."
TeamSolomid,3c1occ,Kumdogmillionaire,2,Sat Jul 4 00:09:06 2015 UTC,"I don't know, Turtle is signed through 2018, I'm doubtful that he'd retire. Players make comebacks all the time"
TeamSolomid,3c1occ,iHartLaRoo,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:45:25 2015 UTC,"I have a horrid feeling that Wildturtle has spoken to them about wanting to retire, and with him not performing, they plan to use Keith as much as possible for when Turtle does want to be let go/until Keith is at his level.   It hurts so much though, he was my favourite player and I was planning to go to LCS next year. But without the opportunity to meet Turtle, it just seems too expensive."
TeamSolomid,3c1occ,Supra53,-1,Sat Jul 4 19:32:17 2015 UTC,I think Lustboy doesn't like turtle that is probably the reason Loco is acting like that

TeamSolomid,3bsx6j,katnizz,36,Wed Jul 1 21:58:21 2015 UTC,"Lets face it guys, Regi wouldn't pay a buyout for Keith if they were planning on keeping him on the bench.   He probably did reasonably well in scrims and they want to see how he will play on stage. Pretty sad for Turtle but we have to give Keith a chance to prove himself before we jump a gun.."
TeamSolomid,3bsx6j,theguywithballs,5,Wed Jul 1 22:09:33 2015 UTC,When I read about Regi buying Keiths contract I had the same thought as you initially. But then I was thinking maybe Regi bought the contract just for insurance down the stretch and playoffs in case turtle regressed again.
TeamSolomid,3bsx6j,phaneuf_fan_3,13,Thu Jul 2 04:36:52 2015 UTC,"It would be interesting if they rotate them depending on the comps they want to play, but I don't want turtle to be permanently relegated to a sub position. =/"
TeamSolomid,3bsx6j,FatTeemo,7,Wed Jul 1 22:45:39 2015 UTC,"I would actually really like that. EDIT: The rotate them out thing, not the bench turtle."
TeamSolomid,3bsx6j,AnakinKB,2,Thu Jul 2 00:48:01 2015 UTC,"Would be nice, but different ADC players do not hold as much ""piece-value"" as compared to swapping mid-laners / junglers.  Even top laners.  I mean, while there are flavors of ADCs, you generally want extra players that can impact the map with a style that is almost completely opposite that of their counterpart or affect teamfight's in a uniquely different manner.  I don't think keeping two ADCs is a smart idea. Might be in fantasy, but not in competitive.   But it still hurts to lose turtle :["

TeamSolomid,3bsx6j,lurkedlongtime,3,Thu Jul 2 13:55:38 2015 UTC,The contract might be because they bought his TL contract which probably ended then
TeamSolomid,3bsx6j,Mattxy8,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:51:41 2015 UTC,They're testing him out and seeing if Turtle will try harder.  If Turtle steps up then they'll keep him
TeamSolomid,3bsx6j,phaneuf_fan_3,3,Thu Jul 2 15:25:46 2015 UTC,I gotta say I'm a little surprised that Keith is replacing Turtle right at this moment. Last weekend was Turtle's best week of the split by far and I really only noticed 1-2 mistakes during the games.   I guess maybe he hasn't been doing well in scrims? or that maybe Keith is killing it in scrims would be possible too I guess. I like turtle but I just want whoever is going to do the best to start.
TeamSolomid,3bsx6j,suicidalmoouky,2,Thu Jul 2 04:35:18 2015 UTC,"I hope they keep both of them in the roster, I like turtle and he played very well in the last two games."

TeamSolomid,3byvun,kingnesh,37,Fri Jul 3 07:30:03 2015 UTC,I might be in the minority here but I actually like Santorin. He's very dedicated and very friendly and fits in perfectly with the team. He's only 17 and it's his first season in LCS and honestly he's very talented and can pick up any champion with ease. He's only problem is early game impact but that can be fixed with proper support staff by giving him more aggressive early game jungle routes.   He only gets better as the weeks go on.
TeamSolomid,3byvun,loveismine,2,Fri Jul 3 07:40:38 2015 UTC,Well said.
TeamSolomid,3byvun,zekkentv,2,Fri Jul 3 15:16:38 2015 UTC,"I actually think the staff made him play this way: Control the map and win with objectives. He used to be VERY aggressive before playing for TSM, so it doesn't make sense to me how his style just flipped 180 degrees like that."
TeamSolomid,3byvun,katnizz,3,Fri Jul 3 15:27:35 2015 UTC,"Meteos could be a sub, but he shouldn't be starting over Santorin right now unless scrim results are promising"

I think the people that dislike Santorin are both an outspoken minority and a product of /leagueoflegends hating on him so tsm fans are inclined to agree   And let me add that OP, I don't think TSM could handle so many roster swap potential situations when they already have the WT/Keith thing consuming their time."
TeamSolomid,3byvun,Marco_Brolo_,9,Fri Jul 3 20:04:22 2015 UTC,"Santorin has been a much better jungler than Meteos this season.  The only reason to get Meteos would be past results, which mean nothing at this point."
TeamSolomid,3byvun,Montaron87,2,Fri Jul 3 09:08:57 2015 UTC,"well, Sneaky said the team didn't click with their combination of 5 players. it could be totally possible that he would do a lot better on an other team that actually clicks."
TeamSolomid,3byvun,OnlyDimitri,6,Fri Jul 3 10:25:57 2015 UTC,"T0M/Bengi afaik isn't really a thing anymore. For a while Bengi wasn't playing top notch so they brought in T0M for youngblood to potentially replace him. T0M was alright but Bengi improved and looked better.  And honestly, Meteos isn't looking so hot this split. I think at the moment Santorin's better but it might be a team thing more than anything."

TeamSolomid,3byvun,Mejti,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:32:02 2015 UTC,"To what end? Santorin is a great fit for TSM. While I think last year he had some short comings top side and he has never come across as a hard carry, that is not what TSM need.   With Dyrus stepping up, Bjerg being the main carry, and recent events changing up the bot lane to hopefully produce better a performance on the bottom side of the map, there is really no need for anyone that plays a different style than Santorin. There is only so much gold to go around.  In the event that TSM did want a more aggressive carry jungler like Insect, Meteos is not a good option, his style is very similar to Santorin. He would add nothing to the current playstlye and only hurt the current dynamic.  Edit: This is just my opinion."
TeamSolomid,3byvun,ShewTheMighty,0,Fri Jul 3 23:12:23 2015 UTC,"As much as anybody can say about Santorin, and his great potential as a young and dedicated player, I also don't think that any one can disagree that Meteos in his top form isn't the best jungler the west has ever seen. Then again I do believe Santorin has the capability to reach that level as well."

TeamSolomid,3bt654,Emendo5,12,Thu Jul 2 06:20:21 2015 UTC,People said the same thing about losing Chaox to Wildturtle. You just gotta trust that Regi is making the best move for the team. He's usually not wrong.
TeamSolomid,3bt654,myaccount101,5,Thu Jul 2 09:39:19 2015 UTC,"The difference here is that Keith is immature and has a hate-able personality, he does nothing but spam memes on twitter and reddit. And he doesn't seem that good of a player either, I really wouldn't like to see him on TSM. Emperor would probably jump at the chance to join TSM, there are lots of better options out there than Keith. TSM Mystic would be fucking amazing.   For the first time ever I will be rooting for TSM to lose if Keith is playing. Feels really weird. Hope they lose every single game with him."
TeamSolomid,3bt654,DatBear978,2,Thu Jul 2 20:03:58 2015 UTC,I believe Sneaky is our best option for an ADC after C9 gets relegated chances are it just blows up and we can nab meteos and sneaky and we could have the dream team.
TeamSolomid,3bt654,myaccount101,3,Fri Jul 3 01:44:42 2015 UTC,"No thanks, Sneaky is overrated and weaker than WT."
TeamSolomid,3bt654,fedmyster,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:57:46 2015 UTC,i think the last time we had to put faith in him was santorin and before that was lustboy so right now if keith turns out to be a good change then its gonna be a killing spree
TeamSolomid,3bt654,AnakinKB,3,Thu Jul 2 20:59:48 2015 UTC,"Idk man, I'd say dont get attached. This is about winning worlds. And if that means making a few changes, so be it."
TeamSolomid,3bt654,fedmyster,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:22:28 2015 UTC,"I wouldnt consider keith a world class player, but i can see turtle being one."
TeamSolomid,3bt654,Marco_Brolo_,1 point,Thu Jul 2 09:18:19 2015 UTC,"Of course, turtle always performs well at worlds. But how do we know Keith wont? Gotta try him out first right?"
TeamSolomid,3bra22,EastRicee,26,Wed Jul 1 14:46:27 2015 UTC,"One thing I found interesting is that Jack from C9 came out and said, 'Dude said he was working with Locodoco, who I know is under contract.'"
TeamSolomid,3bra22,OhThrowed,6,Wed Jul 1 16:53:45 2015 UTC,Honestly the thing that should require the most investigation is the WFX accusation. Match poaching might be worse than player poaching.
TeamSolomid,3bra22,manslayer22,2,Wed Jul 1 17:46:56 2015 UTC,"If Riot had hard evidence of that happening, he'd have gotten much more of a punishment. If that is still under investigation, then woof, Renegades bad luck might not be over yet."
TeamSolomid,3bra22,OhThrowed,5,Wed Jul 1 17:50:00 2015 UTC,https://twitter.com/YusuiLoL/status/616148669432070144  That tweet is what makes me think it might still be under investigation.
TeamSolomid,3bra22,manslayer22,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:51:08 2015 UTC,Nifty. The lack of players actually saying anything about it kinda had me thinking that Riot wasn't quite done yet.
TeamSolomid,3bra22,OhThrowed,18,Wed Jul 1 17:53:59 2015 UTC,What is more impressive of this story is that Regi is giving an interview to Travis.
TeamSolomid,3bra22,kvzon,-4,Wed Jul 1 18:36:14 2015 UTC,"Travis is known to be a great interviewer that pitchs the questions you want asked and make you look good. Obvious choice and looks more professional then Regi talking to the camera by himself.  EDIT: Okay, since this sub seems to have gone full /r/lol I guess I have to explain this. Travis a great choice as a interviewer for this kind of story because he does not ask tough questions or has a agenda. He is willing to work with these owners and allow them to set up questions and the direction they want the interview to go. Who else in the scene does that and has a platform/credibility that Travis does? No one....jesus christ use your head you fuckin morons or please go back to /r/lol with your stupidity."
TeamSolomid,3bra22,llshuxll,8,Wed Jul 1 20:11:39 2015 UTC,"Travis is a horrible interviewer. Never stays on topic, he's so awkward, and his voice isn't the best. Sometimes I feel he only gets interviews because he is the only one to try and also liftlift being his besty."
TeamSolomid,3bra22,BigBlue78,5,Wed Jul 1 20:44:49 2015 UTC,He does have a soft approach to interviews. Which helps him get interviews because the interviewee doesn't have to be paranoid that Travis is going to jump him with questions they don't want to answer. I think that goes a ways to explaining why he gets repeated interviews with players.
TeamSolomid,3bra22,OhThrowed,3,Wed Jul 1 21:21:58 2015 UTC,"I get he has a soft approach and that helps, but it also helps that he has no real competition for interviews. It's hard to take him seriously as an interviewer when half the time he doesn't even get answers to his questions. League needs journalist that know how to tip toe the line between nice and rude. Like if we could combined RL and Travis that would be perfect."
TeamSolomid,3bra22,BigBlue78,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:49:06 2015 UTC,If Travis sucks as much as you claim then he would never get interviews or be hired by gamespot. He has his style and it works out great. I like Travis and his interviews because it is light and you get to see the player's personality. Hard hitting questions in league are tough because you can insult people or you get some humble pr bs.
TeamSolomid,3bra22,llshuxll,-3,Thu Jul 2 03:59:57 2015 UTC,First of all calm down and read what I wrote. If you still do not understand what I wrote then I will happily explain why your hastily and mean spirited comment is wrong and misses the point.
TeamSolomid,3bra22,llshuxll,13,Wed Jul 1 20:50:22 2015 UTC,I think it's awesome that TSM players actually get health care.
TeamSolomid,3bra22,AZF1,11,Wed Jul 1 19:49:48 2015 UTC,This story is just so funny with the timing of the Keith announcement it really has brought out some of the conspiracy theories.
TeamSolomid,3bra22,manslayer22,5,Wed Jul 1 15:21:25 2015 UTC,In what way?  TSM was up front in their dealings with Liquid and Keith.
TeamSolomid,3bra22,meemz9,10,Wed Jul 1 17:03:29 2015 UTC,Conspiracy because people believe that Keith went to TSM so Regi will help Steve (owner of Team Liquid´s LoL squad) in ruining Badawi´s reputation. It´s quite obvious though that this theory is bullshit because Regi isnt a colossal idiot and dick.
TeamSolomid,3bra22,SuicidalSilence,5,Wed Jul 1 17:08:18 2015 UTC,But strengthening ties with the second most powerful owner in nalcs is smart but that started with the xpecial deal.
TeamSolomid,3bra22,BagelsAndJewce,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:19:50 2015 UTC,Well Regi gifted Xpecial to TeamLiquid at a fair price it goes both ways. Still need another 2 future adc just for xpecial.
TeamSolomid,3bra22,no_non_sense,5,Thu Jul 2 01:02:20 2015 UTC,Because for some people Regi making his comments on the Renegade's owner is part of the payment for Steve releasing Keith from his contract.
TeamSolomid,3bra22,manslayer22,2,Wed Jul 1 17:07:04 2015 UTC,"also doing it on ongamers its super strange since they have quit doing interviews with them and such, Its super shady but we also know that reginald isnt dumb so he wouldnt lie or fabricate evidence"
TeamSolomid,3bra22,TheFats216,3,Wed Jul 1 19:43:50 2015 UTC,I'm just happy to see Travis and Regi working together again. Some people seem to take this stuff way too seriously(conspiracy wise)
TeamSolomid,3bra22,Kumdogmillionaire,13,Wed Jul 1 19:52:55 2015 UTC,The people on the main sub are the same ones that always talk about 9-11 being an inside job.
TeamSolomid,3bra22,BigBlue78,6,Wed Jul 1 16:12:31 2015 UTC,You should see r/freelol. It pretty much swaps between sucking Richard Lewis's dick and masturbating over angry Riot conspiracy posts.
TeamSolomid,3bra22,my_elo_is_potato,4,Wed Jul 1 21:31:03 2015 UTC,God... I can't stand that sub.
TeamSolomid,3bra22,BigBlue78,5,Wed Jul 1 21:52:05 2015 UTC,I wish it truly was a Riot free source of news for league of legends but it's turn out to be a sub for riot hate and conspiracy nonsense.
TeamSolomid,3bra22,my_elo_is_potato,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:50:39 2015 UTC,DAE Think Riot is greedy because they want money? what kind of business wants money?

TeamSolomid,3bspoq,TSMCIB,7,Wed Jul 1 20:58:46 2015 UTC,hes listed as starter http://i.imgur.com/kW7cIsZ.png
TeamSolomid,3bspoq,superspamtastic,3,Wed Jul 1 21:48:18 2015 UTC,WTF
TeamSolomid,3bspoq,JaysusMoon,2,Wed Jul 1 21:51:43 2015 UTC,why
TeamSolomid,3bspoq,iChoke,8,Wed Jul 1 21:51:49 2015 UTC,presumably because he's performing better than Turtle in scrims and playing league at a professional level is about results and not about emotional attachments to veteran players   but that's just a guess
TeamSolomid,3bspoq,MiniiNinja,4,Thu Jul 2 01:50:08 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't make sense for Keith not to play LCS games w/ the TSM squad. There's a reason why they brought him in.   Turtle's performance last week was good, but it just seemed like everyone on his team played better than they have the past few weeks.   I love turtle, no disrespect, but we need to give KEITH a chance."
TeamSolomid,3bspoq,Marco_Brolo_,2,Thu Jul 2 06:09:45 2015 UTC,uuuuh why/?/  turtle did well and theyll tell us in PTL today i guess
TeamSolomid,3bspoq,acethewarhawk,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:55:49 2015 UTC,"I mean just because turtle did well doesn't mean Keith wasn't doing better in scrims with the team. Also, now that he is with the team (as in regardless of him starting or on bench) they might as well start him once (especially against TDK) to see if they get good results there (too?)."
TeamSolomid,3bspoq,Triphylit3,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:45:30 2015 UTC,They may not have decided yet. But usually they make announcements.
TeamSolomid,3bspoq,StormknightUK,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:06:02 2015 UTC,Give it some time. TSM doesn't let big stuff like this turn to dust without letting anyone know.
TeamSolomid,3bspoq,ChaseJamieson2nd,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:16:06 2015 UTC,"Guys, there are NINE (9) players listed for TSM on the official riot esports site. It doesn't specify if they're starting players or subs, so don't jump to conclusions - we need to wait for a statement from the team themselves. :)"
TeamSolomid,3bspoq,StormknightUK,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:05:30 2015 UTC,every team's first five players are the starters so he is part of the first five which means he is starting.
TeamSolomid,3bspoq,OhThrowed,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:51:38 2015 UTC,"Not always, there have been case where that isn't true.  Keith has been confirmed as starting for TSM on Saturday though, so you're definitely correct on this one! :)"
TeamSolomid,3bsy3l,manslayer22,4,Wed Jul 1 22:00:34 2015 UTC,Just FYI. Looks like Keith is the starting ADC this weekend. http://euw.lolesports.com/na-lcs/2015/summer/teams/team-solomid
TeamSolomid,3bsy3l,Triphylit3,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:02:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I added WildTurtle/Keith, since we're not 100% sure, we will know on the fantasy page which is updated Thursday at 4:00 PM PST (0100 CEST)."
TeamSolomid,3bsy3l,katnizz,2,Wed Jul 1 22:06:20 2015 UTC,We know for sure that Keith is playing on saturday. It was confirmed on PTL and lolesports. Sunday is anybody's guess though.
TeamSolomid,3bsy3l,manslayer22,0,Fri Jul 3 22:30:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know, This comment was 2 days ago, before PTL, I've changed the thread after PTL."
TeamSolomid,3bsy3l,Regrettings,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:13:10 2015 UTC,"Wonder if he will play both games, or just against TDK."
TeamSolomid,3bsy3l,OhThrowed,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:17:16 2015 UTC,Probably both games. I don't know what Loco and the rest of the staff could really learn from just one game.
TeamSolomid,3bsy3l,Xiryz,3,Wed Jul 1 22:23:37 2015 UTC,"This is kinda weird since both TDK and TSM have both changed their rosters, making it confusing to both teams how good the changes were"
TeamSolomid,3bsy3l,moonfish817,2,Fri Jul 3 20:18:42 2015 UTC,What would Keith playing instead of Turtle do to our chances? I have no idea what we'd look like playing with him.
TeamSolomid,3bsy3l,iChoke,2,Wed Jul 1 22:02:05 2015 UTC,i hope we dont lose
TeamSolomid,3bsy3l,MiniiNinja,2,Wed Jul 1 22:10:01 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't mind if he started. Keith looked good with TL, so if he can keep himself calm and focused for the early game to win lane/go even, maintain cs/wave control correctly in a lane swap, and get the dps in a teamfight he can show us how he will have replaced Turtle, if it's a complete swap"
TeamSolomid,3bsy3l,manslayer22,2,Thu Jul 2 01:12:24 2015 UTC,I expect Keith to perform very well this weekend.
TeamSolomid,3bsy3l,MiniiNinja,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:04:24 2015 UTC,I'm not sure. I expect Altec to do better and not sure about emperor
TeamSolomid,3bsy3l,manslayer22,2,Thu Jul 2 11:14:33 2015 UTC,Well for now Keith is only playing against TDK. So Turtle could still play against Altec.
TeamSolomid,3bsy3l,Pvpal1221,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:05:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah I hope he performs well, because Emperor did well against Dignitas"
TeamSolomid,3bsy3l,Pvpal1221,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:07:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah he did, but Lustboy is better than Kiwi, so I think TSM bot lane will show more strength than Dig's."

TeamSolomid,3bqc05,Caelestor,1 point,Wed Jul 1 08:08:51 2015 UTC,"Exactly. It is always distracting to see everyone scream ""BENCHED!"" when a roster change is made, while in other sports it is completely normal to switch your roster when the game changes, or if someone is in a bit of a slump (people forget that FORM exists. Not even Lionel Messi plays at 100% all the time)."
TeamSolomid,3bqc05,jiruga,2,Wed Jul 1 13:22:25 2015 UTC,Yup. Reddit (and probably more so Twitch) like the drama it generates though.
TeamSolomid,3bqc05,Marco_Brolo_,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:52:04 2015 UTC,Not to mention that having a full squad of subs will allow inter-team scrims and matches wherein the players/teams can try specific strats. It's a good move to make.
TeamSolomid,3bqc05,Dooflegna,3,Wed Jul 1 17:32:57 2015 UTC,"Keith is alright and will probably work fine for TSM. But I'm gonna be sad anyway because Wildturtle is a great player, funny, and the adc I enjoy watching the most when it comes to competitions. Stuff happens when he's around.   To me it feels like the current meta is punishing the bot lane and not sure that Keith can fix any of that. Then again, even in team fights TSM have looked a bit sloppy lately. I dunno."

TeamSolomid,3bqc05,katnizz,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:02:02 2015 UTC,"I would not read into it. Lots of TSM players play with others all the time. Bjerg duos with dominate, DL, and others. It is more fun to duo then play solo."
TeamSolomid,3bqc05,llshuxll,4,Wed Jul 1 20:15:29 2015 UTC,"Nothing bad can really come from it. WT seems to be doing fine under the pressure and improving. It's also a good experience for Keith and he may end up becoming a starter which may mean the team is better. 100% positive outcome, in my opinion"
TeamSolomid,3bqc05,Rigbert,2,Wed Jul 1 08:11:27 2015 UTC,"Not a bad move by any means, even though if Turtle performs as well as he did last weekend on a regular basis he's probably better than Keith. But if the pressure of having to perform makes him play better, it is wise to make it a constant thing. Just curious about how many games will Keith play."
TeamSolomid,3bqc05,suicidalmoouky,2,Wed Jul 1 14:02:01 2015 UTC,"Seems to be a housekeeping move. Liquid isn't using him, he's trying out with TSM, why shouldn't TSM be footing his contract, even if they don't use him?"
TeamSolomid,3bqc05,OhThrowed,7,Wed Jul 1 14:34:59 2015 UTC,"I said this before, but Wildturtle, though he did well this week, 10 minutes in the game from both Team 8 and CLG he was behind in CS. With him behind on CLG I wouldn't brush it past, but against Team 8, Turtle should have been head over heels with farm. Which is a really bad thing in how TSM plays in general. We have yet to see how Keith plays, but from his games with TL he did a pretty good job, even when the pressure was highly on him. Regi/Loco might try to make it a sub list like CLG has at the moment.   With all these players being put into roster, do you guys think TSM will have 5 subs, one for each respected role, to put pressure on the starter role. For instance in any sport game, the main pressure, besides the love of the game they have, is that there is someone right behind you wanting to start also. This would help TSM to constantly have someone to scrim against, for instance if you want to play some comps but you don't want anyone to know, having another 5 man team contracted to you is probably the best way you can keep secrets, and maybe will be a step forward to being a legitimate sport.   If I recall, Samsung White and Samsung Blue did the same thing, but instead they were both top notch teams. You can see how that turned out though, SSW was probably one of the best teams we have yet to see."
TeamSolomid,3bqc05,Magic_Narwhal,12,Wed Jul 1 08:15:05 2015 UTC,"The CS deficit has a bit to do with the strategy that TSM was running.  Turtle pushed down turrets ASAP for more map pressure whereas DL froze waves (which, as Trist, WT couldn't do anyway) and let minions die to tower."
TeamSolomid,3bqc05,MiniiNinja,7,Wed Jul 1 09:24:21 2015 UTC,He was playing Tristana and DL was picking up side lane farm
TeamSolomid,3bqc05,katnizz,6,Wed Jul 1 12:55:44 2015 UTC,You realize that against T8 they fucked up a 4v1 dive and 2 of them died right?

TeamSolomid,3bqc05,Suspense304,3,Wed Jul 1 15:46:13 2015 UTC,Hopefully TSM lets Keith split the LCS Games.   Play Turtle on Saturdays and Keith on Sundays. Let them both play like many Korean teams split time between players. If Keith plays a lot better than Turtle then he gets more playing time and vice versa. The competition will be a good thing. I mentioned this weeks ago that I feel this is the future of the game. Eventually TSM should have a sub for each position that allows them to play different styles depending on the matchup with the other team.

I don't think TSM could choose between Turtle or Keith after only having a week and a half of practice together (including Turtle having a decent week in LCS). I think we need more information before we can make any true analysis over this. This could easily just be Steve not letting TSM have anymore practice with Keith unless they bought out his contract."
TeamSolomid,3bqc05,Recrusive,-1,Wed Jul 1 08:11:30 2015 UTC,"I think MSI showed that tsm has hit a skill ceiling.  If they want to perform better internationally, which I am sure is all tsm cares about, they have to make changes.  I like WT too but I mean c'mon he was down in cs to nien who was known in the CHALLENGER SERIES to be a weak laner.  I'm not saying that keith will be the answer and appropriate replacement but I have no reason to doubt him.  Steve (tl owner) has a good eye for talent and during Keiths brief tenure in the lcs, he was able to beat all of the top teams in the region.  He was really the only reason tl made playoffs last split, as the team was struggling with piglet at first.  I trust Regi to make the best decision for the organization.  With either outcome, the team will be as good as it can possibly be"

I like the idea of subs in general.  Secondly, while turtle did well in the 2 games theres always the possibility of a slump, you have to also think... you know what. The roster locks before worlds/even playoffs i think... If turtle slumps then they are screwed.  Also, there were still some things to work on, or atleast worrying things.  Also, For all we know Keith could be doing extremely well in scrims.  We do not know the team dynamic in scrims.   It could be Keith playing some games soon, and maybe that determines the long term starter."
TeamSolomid,3bqc05,iChoke,-2,Wed Jul 1 10:09:04 2015 UTC,"I expect TSM to put Keith into LCS games against top tier teams.   One good weekend for Turtle doesn't excuse subpar play over the past year.o Turtle got away with playing Trist and overpowered champions, but was exploited during the tank meta where mechanics, game sense is tested.   I'm going on a limb, but the Turtle you see now is the same Turtle at S3, but the game has become more complex and strategic. Turtle hasn't adapted well to the new meta and has shown little improvement since then."

TeamSolomid,3bps6l,Aishateeler,2,Wed Jul 1 08:55:38 2015 UTC,Imagine if he played every game from the start like Dyrus or Doublelift. Imagine how far in the lead he would be regarding kills.
TeamSolomid,3bps6l,EastRicee,2,Wed Jul 1 04:21:37 2015 UTC,It makes me mad that he started late in Season 4 and was only 12 kills away from Mancloud from most kills in a split
TeamSolomid,3bps6l,EastRicee,2,Wed Jul 1 04:23:21 2015 UTC,"He didn't start late. He had to go back to Europe in the middle of Season 4 Spring Split to re-new his visa. He missed about 2-3 weeks. Then in his first split in Europe, he was too young to play for the first 2-3 weeks."

TeamSolomid,3bps6l,Suspense304,1 point,Wed Jul 1 09:02:34 2015 UTC,Why would you think that? You can have 20 kills a game and never have a pentakill. You can have a pentakill and end the game with only 5 kills. Having the most kills all-time has no correlation with the amount of pentakills.

Them trying to end the game is still very sloppy. Glad to see that Dyrus has stepped up, but then again the other teams go full pre- MSI and just completely ignore Dyrus top, and it shows. Ontop of that, both games TSM played Wildturtle was down in cs by the 10 minute mark. Which probably made ending the games this week much longer than needed. They play on lane dominance but from what it looks like, the other teams go on tilt or something like that and they don't pick on what has been TSM's weakness for a while. And when worlds comes.... well let's just say that it won't look so pretty if the other teams they play against in the NALCS keep on under performing.

Compared to TIP they have a less aggressive jungler and better adc, but Dig's mid laner is much more consistent and gamsu can go toe to toe with the current impact.  CLG might be lower if Pobelter can't get back in form and xmithie continues his poor play. GV and TL should be solid.  Best in the west: agree 100%  After playoffs: disagree with Origen taken off, experienced players and xpeke always shows up. Gravity is still quite green and I doubt Keane's off meta picks.  Should be a good run for TSM if they continue this form"
TeamSolomid,3bpxkz,NoNormals,2,Wed Jul 1 06:26:03 2015 UTC,"Agreed with NA. CLG could make it, but mid-split problems start stacking on them again (Xmithie in hospital, DL injury for example), so I don't think they will place that high.

TeamSolomid,3bpxkz,katnizz,2,Wed Jul 1 06:43:37 2015 UTC,"I think your predictions are good until the end of your post. Having 2 EU teams versus 3 NA teams seems really unlikely, just from what we've seen lately. I suppose it depends if Origen falls off or continues to show their current strength (which I fully expect them to do - maybe AT worlds they might not fair as well - but playoffs they should make finals depending on seeding).  More importantly, I think TL gets overrated on this sub sometimes. They are the old Curse don't forget. We haven't seen them on an international stage in AGES (and we NEVER have seen them get to a finals in playoffs). With new LCS format they probably can get to the finals, but when rating their actual strength, their strategy is lacking - they were being exploited a lot last week. They have a decent player in every position - The fact they aren't in second place with their god like individual skills (only TSM has a roster that can rival them in every position) is troubling to me."

Have you been watching the EULCS lately? Fnatic are no longer the same team we saw at MSI (and even then they managed to go 2-3 against arguably the best team in the world). They are, just like TSM, diversifying their playstyle. Except being way more sucessfull than us, and with the advantage of having better individual players at most (one could even argue all) positions. About H2k and Origen I have no idea, but they seem pretty good. CLG are trash who can only win against the bottom teams, and TL always gets destroyed by us."

If they are going to import they probably should get a proven Korean analysis come in and help Loco, parth, and their remote analyst. Adding a player with better mechanics but less ability to actually communicate isn't what they need. I think an analyst coming in with a lot of experience would be good.  ^ I still don't think they need this though."
TeamSolomid,3bnt4j,Badbaseball,5,Tue Jun 30 18:42:10 2015 UTC,If they can find a world class top you take it simply because dyrone wont be around too much longer. And likely retiring this year so it would be fine next season.
TeamSolomid,3bnt4j,chiggmo,2,Tue Jun 30 18:49:15 2015 UTC,"Im not sure i feel like if TSM wants to continue to win NA sure, they dont have to change a single thing, but if we want to WIN worlds not just compete i think you have to look for improvements, Dyrus is playing really well and he could be that 2nd Threat TSM desperately needs but he has already communicated that he has thought of retiring and only chose not to because there wasnt a better replacement, Also WT hasnt looked amazing since S3 Worlds hes a completely serviceable ADC but not a 2nd threat, Id rather be prepared than have to look for a new player last second(gleeb). In my perfect world though TSM would pull an OGN and have a 10  Team roster, with players to put pressure on the starters."
TeamSolomid,3bnt4j,Sageisme,-2,Tue Jun 30 21:13:32 2015 UTC,"You must not watch LCK then. Sorry to say but as the meta stands in order for tsm to win worlds they need a new jungler,top, and adc."
TeamSolomid,3bnt4j,beaniebees,3,Tue Jun 30 20:31:34 2015 UTC,"Top  Flame My dream is for Flame to join TSM. Why? Brand-wise, having Flame would be a wet dream for many people. Style-wise, Flame is a very, very mechanically solid player who is also a top laner that relies a lot on calculated aggression. Given the resources, Flame can not only split push hard but he can also be a crucial component in team fights. Paired with Bjergsen, you will have a team reminiscent of CJ Blaze in Season 3 Spring when they were dominating(up until Dade happened). If he is not playing the best game or he gets a lot of focus, then Flame is one of the best players at laning. I think I can count with only one hand on how many games he lost lane in.  Zionspartan Although he is not my ideal choice of top laner, he is like mini-Flame. I actually think Zion is a very good player and his mechanics are super on point. Plus, he speaks English more proficiently than Flame and has good relations to many TSM members. I don't really see Zion leaving CLG but honestly, if TSM held a try out for top, I could definitely see him playing a couple of scrims with the team. After all, when TSM was looking for a new jungler, Zion was duo queuing all day with TSM members (not troll or relaxing, but very serious games) which shows how much he actually wanted to be on the team.   ZoroZero Very unlikely, but if we give the benefit of doubt to many players such as Tabzz and Sven, then Zoro would be a nice player to consider. Very young, a lot of proven potential. A lot of pros raved him to be the best top laner in all of Europe many times despite him not being even being in LCS. Dyrus said he only wants a player who is either better than him or will has more of skill ceiling than he does, and Zoro sounds perfect for that. Only problem, he hasn't player professionally in a very long time and people may have caught up.  Jungle  Santorin I'm gonna be that one guy and say that I don't think TSM should look for a change in their jungle. The reason being is that I feel that the TSM coaching side has the most trouble figuring out how to help jungle and that Santorin is a very young player who can only get better. The reason why I feel TSM has some of the most  trouble with jungle is that Locodoco himself admitted that he never  really thought much of the jungle role until he saw Dandy play.  He said that this knowledge would've helped Amazing so much more with his pathing and that he is going to focus on the coaching this specific role much more in the future. I feel like Santorin is a very solid player with a good balance of knowledge and mechanics. The one thing that he is heavily lacking in my opinion, is experience. Some things don't click for you as a player if you never had to deal with it. I honestly think Santorin needs time and proper coaching. He shown great play in the past and I am confident that he will grow into a really good jungler."
TeamSolomid,3bnt4j,beaniebees,2,Tue Jun 30 20:28:31 2015 UTC,"Whoa, someone actually listing some players theyd like TSM to pick up. I would have loved to see Zorozero maybe in the teamhouse practicing with TSM if someone told me he was going to join at the beggining of season 5, but im pretty sure he stopped trying to play professionally so i dont think he has the motivation for TSM to just randomly pick him up. Also maybe its because im biased(tsm fan obviously) i dont think zion is better than dyrus, hes good on carries like rumble and jax but dyrus is a way better tank player. Also any mechanical edges zion might have over dyrus i dont think is made up for with the loss of synergy that TSM has with Dyrus."
TeamSolomid,3bnt4j,Montaron87,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:05:31 2015 UTC,I can see your point on Zion but I think synergy will be an issue in the imminent future because I don't see Dyrus playing after this season.

TeamSolomid,3bnt4j,Artaeos,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:39:02 2015 UTC,"I don't think Flame or Acorn are being paid the same amount as Dade.   The amount Korean pros earned salary wise in Korea was lower than a TSM member. I do think they'd dish out 80-100k/year for Flame, but no, TSM can't match a billionaire in a bidding war."
TeamSolomid,3bnt4j,NegativeEagie,2,Tue Jun 30 19:14:00 2015 UTC,"Depending on what Dyrus does this offseason I would really like for TSM, regardless who they pick up, to take Monte's advice and spend a season in Korea.  I understand logistics are somewhat complicated but TSM is doing themselves zero favors by staying in NA. As much as I like WT, I think this off season will see them pick up a new ADC, top (if Dyrus retires), and maybe jung (I think Santorin is a good jungler). I think they should take this roster to Korea, hands down.  TSM cannot deny how beneficial the bootcamp in Korea was last year for worlds. Imagine an entire season there. I can respect the desire to want to make NA a top/elite region but it's just not going to happen. TSM has to continuously play down to the level of its opponents (yes they've been shaky since MSI), which makes it incredibly hard to improve and compete against teams who don't and are always improving.  NA as a region has to mature itself and start taking things more serious. Not just LCS teams/players. Our solo queue is a joke (by comparison) and I don't see it ever changing. Not to mention how many of our players are actually in Master/Challenger vs. other regions. NA culture needs to mature/change and one top team isn't going to make it happen, as much as they want to."

I'm hesitant to replace Dyrus since I see him like Hai. If we replace him we better damn make sure the replacement is 5x better in every aspect since he might not be the best but there are still question marks on how the replacement will synergize with the team.

He's super underrated and I think he's good enough to compete internationally if the other 4 roles are good.   Flame is the obvious choice for top since he has connections with LB and Loco.   ADC I dont really know who is the best that might be available but I would say if you can pick off one of the top ones in CN or Korea you do it, If not and have to stick with NA/EU then I try and get Doublelift once CLG fails this year again."

TeamSolomid,3bkxez,Tokoya11,2,Tue Jun 30 05:58:45 2015 UTC,Thank you! Don't know how I've never noticed that before. I hope they restock it soon.

TeamSolomid,3bku45,MacDoug,20,Tue Jun 30 01:16:21 2015 UTC,"I would be pretty surprised if they hadn't looked into it. It's a lot of work getting a pro team going. And TSM only picks up top talent, the opportunity probably isn't there to pick a team up that's up to their standards."

TeamSolomid,3bku45,Markanaya,-6,Tue Jun 30 02:44:01 2015 UTC,I guess that's a good point but it seems like they haven't even made an attempt
TeamSolomid,3bku45,Markanaya,15,Tue Jun 30 02:55:32 2015 UTC,"it seems like they haven't even made an attempt   How would we know that? I think the only people who would have any idea about whether or not TSM has made any attempts to pick up a Dota team would be Regi, Leena, and potentially Loco (I think I remember hearing that Loco helped Regi decide when picking up some other rosters, not sure).  I'd be very surprised to hear that Regi and Leena haven't made any attempts to pick up a Dota team, or at least looked into it a good amount.  On a side note, CS:GO has a pretty big following and e-sports scene, but I'm not sure exactly which is bigger between it and Dota, but League isn't the only large-scale game they've got a team in."
TeamSolomid,3bku45,imfatal,4,Tue Jun 30 03:22:01 2015 UTC,I guess I wouldn't know if they have or not.
TeamSolomid,3bku45,Markanaya,3,Tue Jun 30 04:01:36 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I didn't mean to snap; I just think it's a bit rash to say that they haven't made an attempt. I'm also hoping to see TSM pick up a Dota roster in the future (when the time is right), it might give me a good reason to try Dota again."

TeamSolomid,3bku45,ljosquaredl,2,Tue Jun 30 04:35:55 2015 UTC,"It's going to be hard for TSM to pick up a DotA2 team at the moment since TI5 is around the corner.  Knowing their reputation for only scouting top-tier talent, there is very little chance that TSM can potentially pick up a roster right now because there aren't that many teams that would leave their respective organizations.  It's risky an org to pick up a DotA2 roster because of the nature of the professional scene. There is no set, organized league for DotA2 and teams have to compete if 2-3 different online ladders at a time, and then have to practice for LAN qualifiers. Take Cloud9 for example: they had to play MarsTV DotA League in China, then DotA Pit Season 3 the next week, ESL One Frankfurt in Germany the week after, and back to DotA Pit Season 3 this week. If your team does not successfully participate or qualify in tournaments/majors, people are going to want to leave and the organization is going to lose money. Look at what happened to the DotA2 division of Counter Logic Gaming, failed to made it to TI2 and slowly started to lose its roster to smaller teams.  (edit) TL;DR: It's too late in the year to pick up a DotA2 roster. Wait till a while after TI5, but before DAC2016 to find a roster to pick up. Has to be well established within leagues, or pull an EG and full yolo create your own squad with a mix of accomplished veterans and young bloods and pray to the gods that you do well in a lot of fucking lans and online events on the road to TI.  Goodnight my S A D B O Y S"
TeamSolomid,3bku45,MagicalQaz,2,Tue Jun 30 09:29:08 2015 UTC,"Still hoping for a Halo team myself, but a lot of the veteran talent is already scooped up and new blood in the scene is a slow going process since it's an exclusive title in a multiplatform/PC world these days."

Usually only get around 5-15k viewers, sometimes 20-25k for finals, and the MCC opener hit 50k. Halo 5 is being ""built for esports"" and they're putting a lot into the scene so hopefully it'll blossom back up again. C9, CLG, EG, there's a bunch of orgs with teams already, just kinda weird not seeing TSM in there as well. Couldn't tell ya who's left that deserves to carry the TSM banner tho, as I said a lot of the best players are already taken:/"

TeamSolomid,3bkibn,KiraTheGreat,2,Tue Jun 30 02:44:15 2015 UTC,"that's a good question, actually. I can't think of any really top tier players that aren't already sponsored. Huh, well there's my answer i suppose."
TeamSolomid,3bkibn,BigMagic,2,Tue Jun 30 04:40:18 2015 UTC,"I believe there's a few top Japanese players who don't have sponsors, such as Bonchan or CEO winning Kazunoko. Also Infiltration from Korea.  As for Western players, most of them seem to have teams already. Granted, I'd think TSM could outbid most of them, save EG. I don't think Snake Eyez is sponsored right now. Really strong Zangief player, top 8'd at last years Evo i believe. Occassionaly streams. Also Smug does well and streams some already."
TeamSolomid,3bkibn,MagicalQaz,3,Tue Jun 30 07:35:38 2015 UTC,"We could also get some players from smaller orgs like 801 Strider, Smug, Mago, or Daigo if we could afford him."
TeamSolomid,3bkibn,hhvu,2,Tue Jun 30 19:58:00 2015 UTC,"If they want to stick to domestic players, the best choices would probably be Snake Eyez or Smug."

TeamSolomid,3bkibn,ZixxLol,3,Tue Jun 30 04:24:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, what he said. Leffen's dream is to be a legend across the fighting game scene. With winning his first major yesterday, he looks to take Evo to solidify his status in melee then slowly branch out, going with Street Fighter next as he practices it on stream a lot as well."

The other day on stream he faced the best street fighter player in all of Germany and traded rounds with him. They were 50/50 and this is before Leffen put dedicated practice time even relative to his smash time. I think he can do it for sure.

TeamSolomid,3bh6ag,EastRicee,11,Mon Jun 29 05:15:30 2015 UTC,Remember back in S2 when CLG bootcamped in Korea and came back inferior to TSM(despite Korea being the better region)? I think it's a bit of a risk tbh.
TeamSolomid,3bh6ag,MayIHaveAHug,7,Mon Jun 29 04:49:48 2015 UTC,Back then there was little to no coaching staff helping them. So they were probably getting destroyed by Korean teams and learning nothing.
TeamSolomid,3bh6ag,aznanimedude,3,Mon Jun 29 04:51:13 2015 UTC,"The situation is completely different from then.  The korean scene was still starting up, and the team that went to Korea was not the best team to go to Korea and learn things IMO.  If you had given the example of the most recent CLG trip to Korea sure, but giving s2 CLG trip as an example is not as good"

TeamSolomid,3bh6ag,suicidalmoouky,7,Mon Jun 29 06:16:35 2015 UTC,"I'd say boot camping in Korea would only be a good idea if they had nothing left to learn here, and I think they have a handful of basic problems that they can fix while staying in NA, such as knowing how to take advantage of early game leads and improving their communication and consistency.  Also, let's not pay too much attention to Monte's dogmas. He's very simplistic at times. Don't forget how useless CLG's boot camp in korea was, while he was their coach, because he failed to attend some fundamental issues within the team while they were in NA."
TeamSolomid,3bh6ag,aznanimedude,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:11:05 2015 UTC,wasn't the problem that he really couldn't attend to them because he'd never really hold that much presence from not being physically there?  pretty sure he's said many times he knew what the problems were but because he was a remote coach he'd never be able to fix them but hoped by bringing them to korea to bootcamp he'd be able to do something about it as he'd be physically there but the players didn't really bother trying to fix things?
TeamSolomid,3bh6ag,suicidalmoouky,2,Mon Jun 29 20:46:42 2015 UTC,"If I recall correctly, he said that he didn't realize how bad the environment between the players was until the team reached Korea. And, by then, it was already too late. By ""fundamental issues"" I meant the team synergy/environment !"
TeamSolomid,3bh6ag,ChrisCrossX,4,Mon Jun 29 21:14:10 2015 UTC,Why should they?  They should finish the split and then boot camp right away. That would be the smartest move.
TeamSolomid,3bh6ag,TwintailsMiku,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:25:32 2015 UTC,"It may be viable. Loco can go there, ask a Korean player to talk to Emperor to join TSM and reunite Blaze bot lane so Riot will have a harder time tracing communications. Next level poaching strats."
TeamSolomid,3bh6ag,acethewarhawk,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:19:03 2015 UTC,"No, clinching a first round bye in playoffs is more important to essentially clinch a worlds spot. Then MAYBE they could go, but you have to remember that not only does it cost a lot, but you have to factor in things like jet lag. It would take them 2/3 days in Korea to recover, then would have to come back to NA soon enough to recover."

First off, they did participate in the World Championship this year under the title of Cognitive Red. They came in 3rd place.  I can't answer the first 2 of your general questions because honestly I don't understand the format of the Smite Pro League and other eSport related Smite things.  The tournament that old TSM won was pretty big. It was the Smite Launch Tournament and they won $104,596  The new roster is great. They are currently tied for the #2 spot in NA, and are guaranteed a spot in the next LAN tournament. TSM just beat Denial eSports 2-0 earlier today. I would say they are definitely going to go to worlds, they are a great team. Last time they faced off against the current ""best"" team they went 1-1 which shows they are capable of winning worlds."

TeamSolomid,3bdzxm,Aishateeler,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:47:55 2015 UTC,"This was to take the first bot turret, Huni was double jungling with Reignover, and they dropped the ward over Gromp and dove, getting the kill and the tower cleanly."
TeamSolomid,3bdzxm,Bloodrazor,0,Sun Jun 28 18:18:47 2015 UTC,"I think it was alright.  He was making controversy over something small but it wasn't too bad.  The dive could have been better, I don't think Zirene should've analyzed the reactionary measures, he should have explained how to make the turret dive work"
TeamSolomid,3bdzxm,Bloodrazor,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:51:11 2015 UTC,"I think thats what he was trying to show, why it worked and that, i was annoyed because there are some great team fights during that game that could have been analysed, and they chose to show the dive that was misplayed rather than an outplay, imho."
TeamSolomid,3bdzxm,Recca1821,3,Sun Jun 28 15:02:33 2015 UTC,"Not really, TSM's teamfighting is the best in NA, it's one of their specialties.  And Team 8 with Nien just sucks at teamfighting.  That botched tower dive did set the pace of the game, but instead of focusing on what turtle should've done to save Lustboy, he should've explained how to make the turret dive successful for TSM and what it would have entailed for TSM or what would the tell tale signs for TSM to call the dive off be (where is the jungler, is shen diveable, etc)"
TeamSolomid,3bd3p4,TSMSaugus,26,Sun Jun 28 02:08:40 2015 UTC,"I'm sure there is more to it than what happened on stream, but he was a game where he lost, but performed well.  Someone on stream made a semi-snarky suggestion on what he should have done to have carried the game and OddOne started going off on the guy.  He started up another game and was tilting because he was so upset and then shut down stream mid game.  It really seemed like something else was going on besides an annoying viewer."
TeamSolomid,3bd3p4,bigshot937,6,Sun Jun 28 02:47:54 2015 UTC,"if youre talking about the zac game, he was pretty salty at the end. entire team was useless sides him. i queued up again after that game and played against him. he didnt talk but his play seemed extremely tilted. pretty sure his stream was off during the olaf game."
TeamSolomid,3bd3p4,Yatlol,3,Sun Jun 28 06:03:03 2015 UTC,"his stream ended somewhere between the 10-20 minute mark of that game. I remember he had been muttering ""I'm done"" repeatedly, and he also said something like ""I do well I get shit, I do badly I still get shit"" (close to that). And then he finally said he was gonna play ads and then the stream was over (while he was still in game).  I don't know if he stayed in the game, but by the sounds of your response he did."
TeamSolomid,3bd3p4,Marco_Brolo_,2,Sun Jun 28 13:43:50 2015 UTC,"yeah he stayed in the zac one. played another after that, pretty sure his stream was off by then."
TeamSolomid,3bd3p4,Yatlol,3,Sun Jun 28 13:55:18 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah I know he stayed in the zac one, but he then streamed for 10-20 minutes of an olaf game."
TeamSolomid,3bd3p4,Marco_Brolo_,3,Sun Jun 28 13:56:53 2015 UTC,"This is correct.  Like I said in my earlier post, he was tilting and frustrated in his Olaf game. After a few deaths he shut the stream down."
TeamSolomid,3bd3p4,bigshot937,7,Sun Jun 28 18:07:19 2015 UTC,was going to rewatch both of the ends of their streams but bjerg's was muted at the end.  guess we'll never know

TeamSolomid,3bd3p4,PlutoniumLoL,3,Sun Jun 28 02:54:03 2015 UTC,Yea Bjerg said before he left its because of something important I assumed it was about turtle or something.
TeamSolomid,3bd3p4,BestSlinkyNA,7,Sun Jun 28 03:07:01 2015 UTC,No its about oddone
TeamSolomid,3bd3p4,TSMCIB,0,Sun Jun 28 03:15:36 2015 UTC,Oddone might be angry because of what's going on  with turtle
TeamSolomid,3bd3p4,Thebestc,3,Sun Jun 28 05:11:27 2015 UTC,What where do you get that from?
TeamSolomid,3bd3p4,EastRicee,6,Sun Jun 28 06:28:34 2015 UTC,might   Probably just an assumption.
TeamSolomid,3bd3p4,ClintRasiert,3,Sun Jun 28 10:23:17 2015 UTC,Yeah for sure but it just kinda seems extremely unrealistic lol
TeamSolomid,3bd3p4,EastRicee,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:45:45 2015 UTC,"Why does it seem unrealistic to you?  I am not saying that OddOne is mad at Loco/Regi for looking for a replacement for Turtle, but it definitely is a big change to suddenly see someone new practicing with the team all of a sudden. In the last episode of TSM Legends he looked really confused when Keith walked in, so maybe he didn't even know about it before.  I don't think he is angry at anyone, but such a sudden change can be confusing and upsetting for someone. Maybe he just doesn't know how to react to it."
TeamSolomid,3bd3p4,ClintRasiert,3,Sun Jun 28 18:32:14 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure he was streaming at the time and no one was told that Keith was coming in that night so he didn't know how to react as he was caught off guard. It seems unrealistic because I just don't understand how he can be angry because of what's going on with Turtle. Many changes have been made to TSM. I don't think it's why TheOddOne is upset.
TeamSolomid,3bd3p4,EastRicee,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:46:20 2015 UTC,"As i said, i personally don't think he was angry, rather as you said caught off guard.  Sure, many changes have been made, but as Loco or Regi(?) said in the video, this was the first time that a change was made because someone was underperforming. IMO that is a big difference if you don't play anymore because you don't want to or because you are not allowed to play anymore because you are too bad.   Maybe there are other reasons for him being upset(i don't watch his stream regularly), but i think that WildTurtle's benching is a part in it."
TeamSolomid,3bd3p4,ClintRasiert,2,Sun Jun 28 19:01:21 2015 UTC,"It may have nothing to do with Turtle, I don't think TSM should remove Turtle, a lot more going on behind game.  If look at the game close enough, you see that something is off with TSM, which has little or nothing to do with Turtle."
TeamSolomid,3bd3p4,abarus,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:32:44 2015 UTC,"nah dude, i know the oddone he probably doesnt give a shit about whats going on in tsm right now hes not the kind of person that gets suddenly mad over things out of nowhere, its extremely unrealistic as said"
TeamSolomid,3bd3p4,Sa0o,5,Mon Jun 29 10:04:11 2015 UTC,oddone has been getting more and more mad and mean for a few months now
TeamSolomid,3bd3p4,quantummajic,5,Sun Jun 28 05:48:48 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. He has days where solo queue frustrates him, but I'd say oddone got mad a bit easier a year or so ago moreso than nowdays."

At this moment I'm rewriting the entire code for the navigation between pages within the extension, making it possible to have multiple pages connected to multiple pages, this will make it possible to have streams link to a page listing all the different teams instead of directly showing the streams.

I empathize with him a lot because we are very similar in many ways, so I feel like I sort of understand what he is going through, which makes it that much harder to watch.  I hope above anything that his friends can help him through this difficult time in his life by giving him the emotional support that he needs."

TeamSolomid,3b8zg4,theguywithballs,16,Sat Jun 27 00:08:33 2015 UTC,"Turtle saying he saw this coming makes me really worried. I really think if he just improves his laning and play safe in team fights, he should be fine. It's his aggressiveness that has been his demise."

TeamSolomid,3b8zg4,Kumdogmillionaire,7,Sat Jun 27 04:39:59 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, Unless WT has a gigantic upswing I can't see how they can justify him being on the roster over Keith or another AD come the end of the split."
TeamSolomid,3b8zg4,Zandari,15,Sat Jun 27 08:16:42 2015 UTC,Dyrus summed up Turtle pretty damn well. A beast when it matters the most but inconsistent overall. Hopefully that changes soon.
TeamSolomid,3b8zg4,Seffor,14,Sat Jun 27 02:22:59 2015 UTC,"The odd phrasing is killing me.  Multiple times Turtle is mentioned as ""on the bench"" ... but hes not. Unless something has very recently changed.  Danger of being on the bench? Sure. Actually benched or on the bench currently... No.  Benching, by definition is removing a starter from play and moving him to a backup role.  Wildturtle is still TSMs starter (unless something drastically changed and PTL got it wrong too)  You cant be on the bench as the current starter."
TeamSolomid,3b8zg4,lurkedlongtime,9,Sat Jun 27 00:54:22 2015 UTC,"I think by the time they made the decision to try out Keith, the forms for this week's roster had to be in so TSM had no choice unless they wanted to be penalized for using the wrong roster + forced to buy out Keith from TL possibly just for those games to avoid poaching fines.  A try out is exactly that. Turtle is effectively removed from the starting roster and he & Keith play for the spot internally."
TeamSolomid,3b8zg4,gahlo,3,Sat Jun 27 05:28:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you could say TSM have no official ADC. Now they have two players coming from the bench competing for the role."
TeamSolomid,3b8zg4,Only1nDreams,3,Sat Jun 27 16:24:46 2015 UTC,"I've been in the same situation back in high school football.. It's better to think of yourself as benched if you have someone openly competing for your spot, makes you more motivated."
TeamSolomid,3b8zg4,ApexRayse,7,Sat Jun 27 16:06:15 2015 UTC,Dyrus seems optimistic. I feel like if anyone can talk to Turtle than Dyrus has the best chance at getting through to him. Maybe Turtle is just a little tired. He can be one of the best if he just finds the motivation in himself to get him back to that next level. I really hope we can see it and if not than we'll have Keith. He doesn't seem like a bad addition. Turtle will also be steaming like Oddone and hes funny as fuck. I'll have someone else to watch besides QT. Damn if comes to that i'll be very sad.

Lustboy is doing with turtle because turtle is the starting AD and still needs to keep practicing for better LCS results
TeamSolomid,3b9e02,Slayer8090,-5,Sat Jun 27 01:39:07 2015 UTC,Keith RT'd that other guy.
TeamSolomid,3b9e02,Slayer8090,5,Sat Jun 27 01:40:11 2015 UTC,like I said Keith is a bit of a troll probably thought it was funny.

But i dunno.  As for LB duo.... He hasnt duod with Keith in a while.   http://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=Casker  Hes been SPAMMING duoque with Lust. Its actually been a long time since he duod with Keith.  The last time he duod with Keith was 18 games ago on that ACCT.  In the 18 games since, most are duo with Turtle.  But of course, I dont know if that matters, because Turtle starts this week regardless."
TeamSolomid,3b9e02,Rigbert,-3,Sat Jun 27 01:56:22 2015 UTC,plus Keith has been duoing with Adriand and WT used to duo with Adrian like 2 days ago which might indicate that TIP is looking to replace their ADC.
TeamSolomid,3b9e02,AtomicDan,13,Sat Jun 27 02:59:53 2015 UTC,"Or, you know, it's duo queue and people will play with other people all the time.  Bjergsen and Zion duo a lot. Obviously that means that Dyrus is getting replaced."
TeamSolomid,3b9e02,suicidalmoouky,3,Sat Jun 27 05:14:07 2015 UTC,"Exactly. This means nothing. Lustboy and Turtle are duoing for this week's games, which is also probably because Lustboy wants Turtle over Keith, because they have so much more synergy so close to worlds."
TeamSolomid,3b9e02,grzb,3,Sat Jun 27 06:46:55 2015 UTC,I don't think one week of scrims would be enough for TSM to decide they're keeping turtle permanently. The tweets could be referring to this weekend.
TeamSolomid,3b9e02,KitKatxz,0,Sat Jun 27 05:12:50 2015 UTC,"Well, according to Fantasy LCS Keith was not trolling. It looks like TSM is going to use WildTurtle as their starting ADC in 5th week."

TeamSolomid,3b4hca,BronzeMasterC,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:14:24 2015 UTC,"Well there is a bit of RNG into the CSGO with weapon spread. First shot accuracy, for the most part is pretty accurate with rifles, but weapon spread is what separates a one-tap with the AK47 and a complete whiff.  As for the basics on spectating professional CSGO:  Be weary of which maps favor which sides. Just because a team is down 9-6 in terms of rounds when they start T-side Inferno doesn't mean they are losing the game. If anything, that just means they won enough rounds T-side to actually win the map.  Also, pay attention to in-game economy. One of the things that I stress to people that I have sort of taught how to play the game is to get out of the mentality that just because you possess the money, that it's automatically yours. It's the whole team's money. With the loss bonus mechanic, after losing four in a row a team can full buy (rifles+armor+utility). If they lose the buy round, they can afford to armor+pistol as a save then be able to full buy after that round.  Roles in CSGO are easy to distinguish when playing close attention. The primary AWPer is self-explanatory. If there's one AWP on a side, most of the time it will go to the primary AWPer. When the T's are set to make a play, the person who usually leads is known as the entry-fragger (which is what I play for my team in CEVO). The In-Game Leader usually calls strats for the team in order to execute site takes/retakes. The other two players are just support riflers that help the entry-fragger."

TeamSolomid,3b42f6,EastRicee,2,Fri Jun 26 04:22:28 2015 UTC,"To put it in a way, they are a breath of fresh air in the North American metagame of CS. Currently, NA is very known for high-tempo play styles in which we value getting a pick early on and proceed with executes within an early time-frame (usually before the 0:45-1:15 minute mark).  In contrast, Keyd Stars follow more of a European style of gameplay, where they take their time and set up a strat out of their ""default"" (a sort of set-up that a team designates as a starting position). Though not as slow as say teams like EnVyUs and Virtus.Pro where they literally wait till the 0:30 mark, they are notable with their precise site takes in comparison to any North American team (except for maybe Cloud9). Also, besides Shroud and n0thing of Cloud 9, Keyd Stars might be fielding the most well-rounded aimers in North America. Fer is an absolute beast and ZQK can absolutely contend against Skadoodle in AWPing."

TeamSolomid,3b3hye,katnizz,5,Thu Jun 25 18:48:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah Turtle isn't the only problem here. TSM's mid and late game has been so bad that if they play like that against CLG, they'll get destroyed mid game even if TSM has a large early lead. The only clean game I remember from TSM was against TIP, followed by the game against CLG."
TeamSolomid,3b3hye,rodrigo8008,2,Thu Jun 25 20:27:31 2015 UTC,"turtle is kind of the reason for that...they keep putting him on kalista where he is always behind, and he cant position on that champion and gets caught out and tsm loses control of the map and/or the game because of it. Remember when faker would kill supports in s3 and his team would control the game because of it? imagine killing the 2nd carry of the team lol...im surprised they've won as much as they have. Just shows how far ahead bjergson is compared to literally everyone else in NA"
TeamSolomid,3b3hye,katnizz,3,Thu Jun 25 22:33:11 2015 UTC,"Oh Turtle is definitely one of the reasons, but others made mistakes just as big. Lustboy got caught multiple times, gave Shiptur 2 free kills early game in the game vs DIG. In the C9 game, TSM let C9 let FREE turrets and let Kog scale even though they were miles ahead in gold. Just very questional mid and late game plays from TSM overall."
TeamSolomid,3b3hye,suicidalmoouky,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:53:35 2015 UTC,Actually despite Turtle being caught TSM were playing pretty well against GV. They screwed up because Bjergsen got caught and then they lost a team fight and started second guessing themselves. So I don't agree.
TeamSolomid,3b3hye,Marco_Brolo_,2,Fri Jun 26 02:10:00 2015 UTC,yeah this should be one of the only games that can test NA as a region. I think CLG and TSM are the only two teams who show the potential to play the meta correctly. So hopefully their few games together will help each other grow.
TeamSolomid,3b3hye,EastRicee,4,Thu Jun 25 19:38:03 2015 UTC,Stop saying it's a free win. Remember how people were saying week 3 was going to be a free week? We lose against Dig and struggle against TDK.

Don't know why Regi cheaped out on Maxnomic. Heard it's really comfortable, but has really bad durability. So basically, Maxnomic was a knock off of the actual DXRacer, which unfortunately isn't used by TSM.   Edit: This was a pretty good Top 2015 PC Gaming chairs. http://computergamingchair.org/2014-comparison-chart/ I kind of see DXRacer as more of the brand, but it does help alleviate back pain."

TeamSolomid,3b0rgu,TSMCIB,21,Thu Jun 25 01:19:50 2015 UTC,"This has already been known actually. As stated in the announcement, TSM would keep him on the starting roster for the following week (basically no matter what). This is mostly because you have to confirm a final roster a week in advance of the game, and they wouldn't have wanted to just put Keith in before having tried him out during the week.  But yes, this is exciting because we get to see if Keith's presence is affecting WT (for the better or for the worse)."
TeamSolomid,3b0rgu,Marco_Brolo_,10,Thu Jun 25 01:24:45 2015 UTC,"The guy is practicing so hard. Over 10 solo q games with scrims every day. The time when TSM scrims with Keith, he spammed solo q. I really hope and pray that he will do well and come back to his form last split.  Also, according to an article, Santorin has ganked bot lane 1 time so far in TSM's 8 games this split. That's an absurdly low amount. I feel like TSM makes Santorin plays a very ""robot-like"" style, which is to stick to a specific plan/path, and that plan for this split is to gank mid and top, which could be the reason why Turtle is not playing as confident as he did last split."
TeamSolomid,3b0rgu,katnizz,5,Thu Jun 25 07:08:12 2015 UTC,"To be fair, the lane hasn't really helped itself. Ganking for a losing lane can be tricky due to just power disparity in itself. In addition, there's cases like TSM's last game on red side where they were pushed under tower and had 0 wards. That's prime time to get counterganked and makes approaching the lane very risky."
TeamSolomid,3b0rgu,gahlo,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:09:02 2015 UTC,"I agree, but it seems like they never put an effort to even get the lane going. Like you said, they were pushed under tower and had 0 wards, which shouldn't happen in a lane. Lustboy used those visions around mid instead of bot to get Bjergsen going."
TeamSolomid,3b0rgu,katnizz,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:26:32 2015 UTC,"With Turtle performing the way he has been, it's not surprising."
TeamSolomid,3b0rgu,gahlo,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:31:05 2015 UTC,"I just think that it's not an ideal way to leave the player that is in a slump by himself and let him rot. A really good jungler would be more creative with his jungle paths, instead of abandoning a lane completely. Last split it was Dyrus, this split it's bot lane/Turtle. I think it's more of TSM's coaching staff wanting them to play this way instead of Santorin, but overall I think it's way too easy to be taken advantage of. Like right now team can just look at TSM and just go gank bot level 3, because it's basically free kills/pressure.  Also, I think Turtle didn't play too bad excluding last week's games."
TeamSolomid,3b0rgu,katnizz,3,Thu Jun 25 15:39:00 2015 UTC,They can use both if they want. They new rules allow sub ins.
TeamSolomid,3b0rgu,OmegaApple,8,Thu Jun 25 02:01:50 2015 UTC,"He's not a ""sub"" though (yet) right? I think, and correct me if I'm wrong, that he was brought on for ""in-house tryouts"" but not on the official roster as a sub yet. I'll go to lolesports and double check."
TeamSolomid,3b0rgu,Marco_Brolo_,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:14:16 2015 UTC,Correct. He still hasn't even been released by Liquid.
TeamSolomid,3b0rgu,apdermond,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:50:59 2015 UTC,True i forgot he wasnt actually on the roster yet. They have to buy out his contract before they can use him.
TeamSolomid,3b0rgu,OmegaApple,8,Thu Jun 25 02:55:43 2015 UTC,"But he needs to play it. If he can't, TSM needs someone who can. She is too much of an incredibly powerful pick to just say ""no we will always ban it"". We saw that become a disadvantage for TSM at worlds for example, as they had to ban nidalee and zilean every game."
TeamSolomid,3b0rgu,Marco_Brolo_,4,Thu Jun 25 01:35:49 2015 UTC,"oh ok i understand what you mean now. but don't you think they should pick it if the situation favors it? For example, they maybe should first pick it if it gets through the ban phase? I know that versus clg, for example, it may perhaps be dangerous to not first pick kalista if they don't ban it."

TeamSolomid,3b0q4a,EastRicee,2,Thu Jun 25 01:09:02 2015 UTC,"I've never fully understood all the hate with Santorin. He's a really smart player and mechanically solid, but he is also young and inexperienced. I am very patient to hold my judgement with Santorin because of this as opposed to someone like Wildturte or Dyrus, who had many experience playing in the pro scene."
TeamSolomid,3b0q4a,beaniebees,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:27:27 2015 UTC,And it's certainly promising that even as such an inexperienced player he's performing so well. I have high hopes for how he's going to do once he has more exposure to playing against really top-tier junglers.
TeamSolomid,3azh0x,EastRicee,5,Wed Jun 24 19:14:26 2015 UTC,There thing on Dyrus is pretty solid too. He's good but he can't do the thing that most world class toplaners can do which is both carrying and playing tanks which is a pretty big mark against TSM.
TeamSolomid,3azh0x,MagicalQazq,2,Wed Jun 24 19:50:19 2015 UTC,"He has in the past, quite well. They just haven't let him as much as they should be."
TeamSolomid,3azh0x,pillowmagic,2,Wed Jun 24 22:53:17 2015 UTC,"When was he a carry threat though? Season three is as recent as I solidly say he could do both and even then he was outclassed by many korean and even some chinese toplaners like Gogoing. Now it's season five and there are a lot more stronger toplaners in asia alongside Huni who is without a doubt the best toplaner in the west. Even if they let Dyrus try to carry will he be able to? I really doubt it when compared to people that may go to worlds like Flame, Acorn, Duke, MaRin, Huni, Smeb, Koro, Zztai, and the like."
TeamSolomid,3azh0x,MagicalQazq,3,Wed Jun 24 22:57:27 2015 UTC,"S4 Ryze? His Rumble's quite good. The issue isn't Dyrus, it's TSM's system of (here's the 5 champs you're going to play). Dyrus did blogs about it all the time when Regi was still on the team. TSM is too predictable in their champion pools. They never set the meta, they just follow it. You would never, and will never, see a top lane Cassio out of TSM. Not because Dyrus can't play it, but because that would be champ 6.  THAT is TSM's real issue. Do you think Bjergsen could play Yi? Is the champion too mechanical? When have you ever seen any of their players play something unexpected? Are you ever like, wow, I didn't see that pick coming. What an awesome counter to the other teams choice! NOOOOOOPE. It's the top 5 champs and nothing else."
TeamSolomid,3azh0x,pillowmagic,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:04:04 2015 UTC,"Those were like 2 best of 5's vs NA/CN teams that weren't/aren't good enough to place well at international events anyway. His recent Rumble play has vs NA players none of which are amazing or even great toplaners. The only ones we have that are close are like Quas, impact, and Zion and even they are more inconsistent than not. And two of them are import players. Plus his rumble's been pretty mediocre as of late. He looked outclassed by the likes of fredy122 who wasn't even a top five toplaner in the entire tournament. And many of the top teams don't set the meta either they just follow it and outpreform the pioneers. SKT and EDG just dick around the regular season because they're so much better than everyone else that it's funny but when they have to play vs other elite teams like LGD for EDG or CJ for SKT they take that shit seriously and use meta pciks and abuse the hell out of them because they are that good. TSM isn't that strong right now so they play meta which is fine but their players aren't good enough to stack up against the other top teams in the world so they'll lose a lot more than they would win.   EDIT: Besides if they rely on cheese and off-meta picks for wins vs good teams that wouldn't mean they were good it's just that they have a random style like UOL which can upset in a couple of games."
TeamSolomid,3azh0x,MagicalQazq,0,Thu Jun 25 00:13:58 2015 UTC,"I agree. Everyone on TSM is very good at their lane/role maybe Top 1/2 in NA for each position. Although, I feel dyrus hasn't been as good since TP has become mandatory. Problem I see is TSM has gone down a path where the management have over analyzed everything to the point they have become predictable... at champion select you can see which champ they will take every time. They need to start thinking pro-actively and be ahead of the curve. Look at every game the past season they play every game the same - safe and farm, hope to win team fights/catch someone out and get objectives. They rely on scrim results way too much and expect to just load up and walk over other teams because they won a couple scrims. Although the most positive thing TSM has improved on this split is the lane control/vision - even behind they can control the lanes well.  I don't think TSM need to do crazy out of meta picks but they can't be predictable every single game. As other pros have said when playing TSM it's like playing a against a brick wall - TSM win by wearing you out and playing team fights well. Which doesn't work against top teams in other regions they will be aggressive early which is always TSM weakness."

TeamSolomid,3awpm4,EastRicee,14,Wed Jun 24 02:51:54 2015 UTC,"Good points. I think people are overlooking TSM's poor preparation during MSI. They read the meta wrong, which had a part in their performance on top of individual under-performances.   Hopefully the mentality of the team isn't using WildTurtle as a scapegoat for their performance. They have a lot to work on in their P&B, shotcalling, communication. Even Bjerg just seems out of sync w/ his team. Turtle is only a part of the problem."

TeamSolomid,3awpm4,NSFWIssue,3,Wed Jun 24 15:44:00 2015 UTC,"They went away from their own style without changing sufficiently. For some reason they are continuing to move away from the classic TSM meta, and it's still unclear why. If dyrus is on a carry top and sivir is open, then turtle should be on sivir. It's one of his best champs and one of the best champs in the meta. if Turtle is on a hyper carry and lulu or maokai is open then dyrus should be on that. You can't redirect resources, gank pressure, and stop lane swapping and then still excpect turtle to be the hyper carry."

TeamSolomid,3awpm4,margalolwut,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:24:55 2015 UTC,He writes some of the best League-related articles. The topic was his articles and you mention how he talks. Makes sense.
TeamSolomid,3awpm4,Diminitiv,6,Thu Jun 25 23:46:01 2015 UTC,"Any discussion about the efficacy of replacing WildTurtle with Keith during scrims needs to also mention Keith himself. We cannot simply ask whether WildTurtle being replaced is a good idea, we must also ask whether his replacement is a step up or a step down.    There are also the obvious reasons as to why Reginald chose this route to help Turtle improve. While scrims are a method to help a team improve its overall gameplay, rotations and shotcalling, allowing Turtle to focus on solo queue is going to help Turtle fix what Turtle needs fixing: his mechanics. The article points out that it is Turtle's positioning that is sometimes to blame, but seems to downplay its importance by saying that there is a general lack of understanding of the current tank meta among the team.    The other obvious benefit to having Keith scrim is to give Turtle the ability to take a clearer third-party perspective when looking at TSM's ADC role and what is required of it.    The benefits for Reginald are clear: he will be giving his ADC a chance to focus on his own weaknesses and to better reintegrate himself into the team dynamic, while also letting the team continue practicing their teamplay and strategies. Further, should Keith turn out to provide something that Turtle does not, Reginald has the choice (I assume) to have two ADCs on the roster. Should Keith turn out to be better, or should Turtle collapse under the pressure or should Turtle lose his motivation, Reginald can pick up a young talent with proven experience on the LCS stage and an affinity for unselfish ADC play."
TeamSolomid,3awpm4,Provokyo,6,Wed Jun 24 05:15:03 2015 UTC,Depends how you define mechanics. IMO turtles mechanics are fantastic but his positioning can be questionable. Part of positioning as an ADC is relying on your team to position correctly for you to deal damage..
TeamSolomid,3awpm4,LimpingGoat,3,Wed Jun 24 07:30:16 2015 UTC,"A good point. While mechanics are ones own responsibility, positioning can be dependent on others. It is absolutely a question of you following up on others moves and others following up on yours.    However, it's also definitely the case that one's participation in a team's strategy changes the strategy. A top lane initiator plays differently depending on whether they know they have an aggressive or passive ADC. When your own participation colors and changes the dynamic and result, it's tough to be able to review it objectively.    I think what Keith gave to Liquid, and to Piglet, was the chance for Piglet to see a different way for Liquid to play. Piglet was then able to come back. Hopefully, Keith will do the same for TSM."
TeamSolomid,3awpm4,Provokyo,2,Wed Jun 24 07:44:19 2015 UTC,"I really hope this works out, but I know 100 percent if TSM has to replace Turtle with Keith it will be a downgrade in skill."
TeamSolomid,3awpm4,LimpingGoat,3,Wed Jun 24 15:25:20 2015 UTC,I don't think anyone said he was the culprit of TSM's losses. Regi and Loco are just trying to motivate him the same way Liquid did with Piglet and I think it's a good idea.
TeamSolomid,3awpm4,suicidalmoouky,2,Wed Jun 24 14:15:03 2015 UTC,I think this is the right step. TSM has only made one roster swap blunder (with Gleeb) and they quickly fixed it. Trust Regi. He's not an idiot.

TeamSolomid,3atr6u,ApexRayse,0,Tue Jun 23 18:40:47 2015 UTC,"His weaknesses have always been in teamfighting. He is too quick to make the hero play, even when it is totally unnecessary, and it has turned many a good initiate into a sour fight.  The most standout example in recent memory was the flash-suicide OVER the enemy Azir wall (two weeks ago? I've been traveling for work so my schedule could be off.)   The teamfight went decently for TSM, they had the opponent backing off. TSM wasn't in a stellar position themselves, but they could have possibly parlayed that into dragon control or turret pressure.   Then Turtle went full... Turtle. It went from a nearly even teamfight with a slight TSM advantage into a large momentum swing against them.   Even if he had gotten the kill, he had no way out. He basically blew flash for a 1-for-1 against an opponent who was already being forced to back (and be off the map for ~15 seconds.)   The upside for that play was tiny compared to the downside. Mistakes happen in the LCS, but Turtle makes a boneheaded play of that nature (though usually not to that level) on a weekly basis."

TeamSolomid,3aw8bs,bigshot937,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:40:08 2015 UTC,"Looking at those stats, I think his poor positioning is the direct cause for being low in all of these.  If your ADC dies right away each fight, his KDA, kill participation DPM suffer.  Damage % and Gold % are not stats I value very much, as they're both directly dependent on flat DPM and KDA, and they depend on resource allocation of your team. On TSM, it seems that Dyrus, Bjergsen and Santorin have priority in terms of gold, so Turtle comes in lower in those stats.  So if Turtle fixes his positioning, he's still a top ADC in NA.  That said, I feel Turtle needs to start playing carries who don't have escapes. Turtle seems like he trusts too much in his ability to save himself on mechanics alone, so if his champ has an escape mechanism (Kalista, Corki), he plays too aggressive and gets caught. When he's playing carries that don't really have these escapes (Sivir, Jinx) he seems to play more save and does fine."

TeamSolomid,3auw6d,Jaweh,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:31:19 2015 UTC,"I'd assume Massan wants to play competitively and TSM's Hearthstone division simply isn't competetively relevant in any way. Cloud 9 and a lot of other teams give him more than 5 potential scrim partners to theorycraft, test decks and scrim with without any risk of leaks. On TSM only Trump appears on tournaments from time to time and their schedules conflict (streaming times and different timezones), but even if they would be able to do this stuff together, it's still far too small of a sample size to be relevant as a test.  Essentially, TSM only has the brand and a salary to offer, while C9 offers both of these and a squad of competitively relevant players to interact with, as stated above."
TeamSolomid,3auw6d,Radion4k,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:59:36 2015 UTC,"He said on stream that he didn't like the environment, and he felt that he couldn't grow and branch out under TSM's wing.

He wants to play competitively and the staff that TSM have, while they are great players, are that great / serious competitive players"

TeamSolomid,3aqm8u,Luminancee,41,Mon Jun 22 18:39:34 2015 UTC,I honestly don't know how I feel about this. I wish Turtle would just step up. He's one of my favorite players on the team right now.
TeamSolomid,3aqm8u,FatTeemo,12,Mon Jun 22 18:56:20 2015 UTC,"I think that mindset is what is contributing the most to his current slump honestly.

This might delay winning worlds until next year however (but I dont think we can win this year playing as we are anyway)"

TeamSolomid,3aqm8u,Accurized,-8,Mon Jun 22 19:18:38 2015 UTC,"I don't think so.. he's not really an improvement, he's not gonna win lane and not have better late game positioning. Turtles positioning is one of the best.. I just don't see how he's an upgrade unless he shows potential"
TeamSolomid,3aqm8u,MiniiNinja,9,Mon Jun 22 19:24:04 2015 UTC,"Turtle has some of the worst positioning in the LCS as far as ADC's go. Turtle gets caught out of position all the time. I like Turtle but he is the weakest link. He doesn't win lane, and he gets caught in team fights. He has flashes of greatness when his overaggressive plays work, but the payoff isn't consistent. All TSM needs is an ADC that can win lane and clean up."
TeamSolomid,3aqm8u,Suspense304,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:30:46 2015 UTC,Well this week I agree he has had bad positioning.. go watch games from last split.. turtle had perfect team fight positioning
TeamSolomid,3aqm8u,MiniiNinja,8,Mon Jun 22 19:36:14 2015 UTC,"I explain this in another comment. Lustboy covers up a lot of Turtles positioning mistakes because Lustboy is amazing at playing defensive supports. Janna and Nami were big keys in last split for Lustboy. When he plays engage supports (which he isn't great at) Turtle all of a sudden gets caught a lot. It's because Lustboy isn't disengaging and the other team is taking advantage of Turtle's weakness in positioning.  Xpecial is a great engage support. When they played together they won lane, because Xpecial fixed Turtles weak laning phase. But Turtle got caught all the time. Lustboy fixed that problem and opened up the laning issue.   However, now, TSM is playing a lot of engage supports and TSM is losing lane and Turtle is getting caught."

TeamSolomid,3aqm8u,phaneuf_fan_3,2,Mon Jun 22 18:47:11 2015 UTC,Who could we import though?
TeamSolomid,3aqm8u,MiniiNinja,2,Mon Jun 22 19:14:20 2015 UTC,Pilot from Jin Air who can be considered the best ad left in korea and would be a feasible pickup as Jin Air have being playing with only Cpt Jack recently. Fury is great also and is on a fairly bad team so he may want to make the move. Duke can come into the toplane if we pay enough before the CN teams get involved ssumday is also on kt and perhaps would like to make the move. Korea solo q has notoriously good toplaners so one could be scouted from there. Junglers from foreign regions could be like Spirit if he starts getting depressed from being on WE(most likely won't due to the bank he's making though) Peanut from Najin is someone with immense talent and could be very good and Chaser has champion pool issues but has good pathing and mechanics. These are some possible imports TSM could make.
TeamSolomid,3aqm8u,MagicalQazq,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:08:04 2015 UTC,well the obvious answer is a korean...but i dont know which one. having loco and lust does make it way easier for tsm to have a korean on the team than others though. also possibly forgiven? i can imagine gambit getting old fast when they either dont make playoffs or just dont have a chance vs other top eu teams.

Some might even rank him #1 over Forgiven, because of raw champ pool.  Hes pretty good, when CW wins, its usually because he went off, in both their wins this year. CW won off the back of a very fed Freeze.  Hes also known for drawing bans, because he has a pocket pick Draven that absolutely stomps.

Piglet proved that. That said, potential and Regi's world class roster decisions. If things go bad for Turtle, you can always rely on Regi making the best decision for TSM's future."
TeamSolomid,3aqm8u,Crownocity,3,Mon Jun 22 21:33:15 2015 UTC,"I dont know, but what i do know is I think its worth looking into. Turtle has not had the best performances lately, and its costing TSM.... in NA.   Turtle getting caught and not flashing, major reason TSM lost to Dig, TSM almost lost to GV because Turtle ate all the hooks.  And Despite this, Turtle is not putting out Damage either, hes bottom of the table of ADC damage, and he doesnt have the excuse of ""im my teams main focus"" that maybe some other lower tier teams could use.  Turtle on the top of his game, the one we see show up to international tournaments (sans MSI) and do well against the best? Keith wouldnt even be a thought.  The thing is, if Keith can sit in the back, position well, and not get caught while laying damage as the other team  pounces on Bjerg. Thats the upgrade TSM could use.  TSM has no chance to even get out of groups at worlds, if Turtle is eating hooks from CN or KR teams, or if Turtle is losing the damage war to Dyrus on Gnar consistently."

I'm questioning his and Lustboys synergy. He did not have these problems with Xpecial.  This year, he has been pretty poor all around. He's my favourite player on TSM and I would be sad if he goes but if Reginald wants a worlds title, he need the best players."
TeamSolomid,3aqm8u,captncarry,2,Mon Jun 22 19:04:16 2015 UTC,"Lustboy is a defensive support. Turtles positioning has been awful. Lustboy covers a lot of that up because he is amazing at doing that type of thing. Xpecial and Turtle won lane a lot because Xpecial is an engage support and covered up Turtles weak laning phase, but when team fights roled around Turtle had no one to protect him from being out of position.   Turtle has benefitted from two of the best supports NA has had, and with each of them he had a different weakness. It just so happens that the weakness he showed was what the support wasn't focused on."
TeamSolomid,3aqm8u,Suspense304,8,Mon Jun 22 19:40:32 2015 UTC,"Just pointing at Xpecial and saying he carried WT is not true. When he joined and played a lot of Draven, he smashed and Xpecial just had to follow-up. The first split Turtle played, he were great in lane."
TeamSolomid,3aqm8u,captncarry,3,Mon Jun 22 19:50:25 2015 UTC,That's been a long time ago.
TeamSolomid,3aqm8u,Suspense304,4,Mon Jun 22 19:58:22 2015 UTC,"Of course, I'm not saying it isn't long ago. But he meshed with Xpecial then and outlaned all botlanes, that was my point."
TeamSolomid,3aqm8u,captncarry,3,Mon Jun 22 20:03:03 2015 UTC,"Initially. My point is that over the past two years, Turtle hasn't been good. And when I say good I mean on a big scale. He had a decent showing at worlds in S4, which was a surprise, but outside of that he's been pretty mediocre."
TeamSolomid,3aqm8u,Suspense304,2,Mon Jun 22 20:05:34 2015 UTC,"Well, he had a great S3 worlds too. But he has been, as you said, mediocre. What I initially wanted with my post was to say that Turtle and Lust might not be the best fit for eachother. However, that doesn't explain his positioning issues and poor judgement sometimes. It only explains the weak laning phase."
TeamSolomid,3aqm8u,captncarry,2,Mon Jun 22 20:08:54 2015 UTC,"this, yes, you are right 100% and thats the same reason last split turtle was able to carry a lot of games, meta was diferent, nami and janna were priority picks, and with those u had strong disengage to make up for misspositioning and turtle was able to hard carry with hyper carrys,but right now the meta is kalista, sivir and maybe ashe all, supportive adcs and the supports are hard engage, wich makes wt misspositioning punishe ablefor enemy teams"
TeamSolomid,3aqm8u,Hashmalek,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:18:56 2015 UTC,Honestly I feel like this is part of the reason for the decision. Turtle cannot have good performances one split and then do bad for half of another split. Consistency is important for teams with goals like TSM and consistency for Turtle is an issue right now.
TeamSolomid,3aqm8u,manslayer22,9,Mon Jun 22 19:20:47 2015 UTC,"From the video it's clear that they have been keeping an eye on Keith for some time now. It's also clear that Keith/TL has been in talks with TSM about this move for a while. Maybe they even started scrims already last week.   It's been 22 hours since last LCS game and it would be impossible to make such decision, deal with Steve, get Keith in house, make a video, write article etc on such a short notice. This means we could see Keith in LCS as soon as this week. Some quotes to analyse:   ""...We'll have to make some difficult decisions this week"" ""This is probably the first time in TSM's history to bench a player purely on performance..."" ""...changes will be made in accordance with Riot’s ruleset and announced after approval""   To me, the Devil's in the detail and it looks like they have already made their mind up and just sorting out the paper work with Riot/TL Steve."
TeamSolomid,3aqm8u,loveismine,2,Mon Jun 22 19:46:59 2015 UTC,You guys still missed the part where Turtle hasn't actually been benched yet..

TeamSolomid,3aqm8u,katnizz,0,Mon Jun 22 20:40:19 2015 UTC,which would also point out why turtle nodded his head after the gravity game since he already knew that he was probably going to be benched

TeamSolomid,3aqm8u,Schurbles,-1,Mon Jun 22 19:27:48 2015 UTC,"Hardly an insult. Turtle isn't even a top 4 adc in NA. He isn't the type of player this team needs. I like the guy, I'm not sure you can say anything bad about him, but he isn't a great player. Being a fan of the person isn't the same as wanting something better. Keith is a better laner, and proved that he can clean up fights. That's what TSM needs. Maybe the tryouts don't go well and Turtle stays. I'm fine with that. But if Keith comes in and can fill that role the way we need an ADC to do it. I say bye Turtle, I appreciate the effort and memories."
TeamSolomid,3aqm8u,Suspense304,3,Mon Jun 22 19:38:37 2015 UTC,I really hope that he do the same thing piglet did and get better and not like chaox did and quit instead
TeamSolomid,3aqm8u,Soldpatmomforrp,3,Mon Jun 22 19:33:54 2015 UTC,I could be wrong but I don't think Keith gives a better shot at worlds.

TeamSolomid,3aqm8u,Pwoper,2,Mon Jun 22 19:02:19 2015 UTC,"I will be very sad to see Turtle leave if he does get replaced. I honestly believe that it is not just his own failure as a player, but also the failure of the coaching staff to take the time to understand him and give him the appropriate help.  Most of all, I hope that he won't take it too hard as he does seem like a very inwardly emotional player.  Keith is a great guy and a great player, and I believe he has the work ethic to fit in with the rest of the team. I think he will do well with them.  A little off-topic, LiquidSteve consistently proves that he is a cool as hell guy, he really cares about his players.  And as always, respect to Regi for handling this situation very well"
TeamSolomid,3aqm8u,NSFWIssue,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:05:44 2015 UTC,How is it Loco's fault that turtle cant position? How is it a coaching staff issue if turtle has continuously gotten caught out in this split?
TeamSolomid,3aqm8u,tharan1,0,Mon Jun 22 19:10:51 2015 UTC,"B/c they aren't doing a great job of helping him. Obviously I don't know the whole story, but based on TSM Legends they just say ""Turtle stop being bad"" and expect it to work. And for some people it will, but for a lot it won't, and it's their job to understand that. It's their choice how they treat him, I just figure they're obliged to be effective.  Of course they are also allowed to prefer players who are more internally motivated like Dyrus."
TeamSolomid,3aqm8u,NSFWIssue,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:47:05 2015 UTC,Please explain how a coaching staff is supposed to teach a pro player positioning. Positioning is something you learn by playing hundreds upon hundreds of games and getting experience. It's like asking Loco to teach Turtle how to CS. It seems like you don't actually know what a coaching staff is supposed to do if you think that they can help with Turtle's positioning. Coaching staff isn't there to control their players like robots during game.
TeamSolomid,3aqm8u,tharan1,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:12:22 2015 UTC,"It's very obvious that Turtle is an emotional player. If he does not receive the appropriate support then he could flounder like he currently is. For someone like Turtle it might be hard to improve and to work your hardest without a good support system.  The other players and the coaching staff are all Turtle has. He works with them all day every day, and his home is far away in another country. It's their job to be there for him.  The mistake you (and not just a few others) are making is assuming that it literally is only about mechanics and nothing more. A player's mental state is just as important. You are somehow forgetting that they are just human beings too. It's not just about willing yourself to get better regardless of any circumstance."
TeamSolomid,3aqm8u,NSFWIssue,0,Tue Jun 23 13:22:48 2015 UTC,If you're not emotionally cut out for being a pro player then you shouldn't be one. It's as simple as that. Coaches are not therapists. If it's an emotional problem then he needs to see a professional to talk to. You're somehow forgetting that the Coaching staff is their to coach the team not to hold there hand and ask them how their day was.
TeamSolomid,3aqm8u,tharan1,2,Tue Jun 23 13:50:10 2015 UTC,"I feel this is really only to pressure Turtle, because Keith certainly isn't the answer to our problems unless he's improved a decent amount since he last saw lcs play. He did OK with TL usually making comps around keeping him alive, otherwise he was a non factor for the most part and didn't do anything special. Really hope Turtle just steps his game up in response to this so management isn't forced to make the decision between the 'lesser of two evils'. Maybe I'm underrating Keith, but IMO Keith isn't any more of a world class player than Turtle is or can be."
TeamSolomid,3aqm8u,jdw142,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:12:44 2015 UTC,Turtle can singlehandedly throw games. Thats what Tsm is trying to prevent. While Keith may not be a world class Adc hes also not the kind of Adc who will play overly aggressive and get caught out.

Maybe Turtle should hang out with Dyrus more and learn from his example to improve. Whatever happens, I hope there won't be bad blood between the team and Turtle :(  If Turtle has to be benched, let him stay and stream like OddOne.

TeamSolomid,3asc6p,EastRicee,10,Tue Jun 23 02:57:20 2015 UTC,"You know, (this is mostly because im bored out of my mind working the graveyard shift)  To be honest, to me this sounds very much like WildTurtle is out, one way or another, with a very, very slim chance to earn his job back.  Reginald uses very agressive wording about the subject saying  ""This is the first time i have benched a player for performance"" Well... Technically, Turtle hasn't been benched yet right? He is still Technically TSMs starting ADC.  I almost wonder if some of the wording from that video ""Big changes need to be made, etc."" I just think that its unlikely to go back to turtle. The video, in particular seems like a PR statement, that would be harder to back down from than move forward with.   That said, to me Keith is a truly interesting choice, im sure if we had known before the Split, guys like Freeze (who TSM could pick up now, due to the changes in residency rules) would be in play, but arent right now because no way in hell CW would deal Freeze in the middle of the LCS split.  But what makes Keith interesting, is his limited LCS success. He went 5-1 with a team that honestly, looked like absolute ass with Piglet in the lineup until playoffs.  I mean, iirc. The team went 5-1 with Keith, something like 5-8 with piglet. (They played 19 games, because of a tiebreaker)  So the question begs why? Well they beat TSM and CLG two time with that line up  Total Games were with TIP (1 sub), CLG 1 sub (No Zion) Full TSM, Full CLG, WFX (loss) in the loss 3/2/2 was his score.  So, looking at his games:  Wins:  Week 1 vs TIP:  6/1/11 Kog'Maw Highest Damage on TL, 2nd in game behind Apollos Sivir (Apollo did insane damage for being 1/2/7) I almost wonder if Apollo was going too Ham or something?  http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/TRLH1/30091?gameHash=0ed1cd0e0e57329c&tab=stats  Week 1 vs CLG:  9/1/12 Caitlyn   Most damage in the game  http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/TRLH1/30149?gameHash=c1678fe8c1106f56&tab=stats  Week 5 vs GV  2/0/5 Corki  http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/TRLH1/1001040111?gameHash=ca91673c6bf73b8c&tab=stats  Quas Hard Carried this game, noone was close to him in score or damage. Keith came in 2nd on Damage in the entire game... and he did 1/2 of Quas' damage. Quas dominated the game.  Week 5 vs TSM  10/3/10 Corki  Most damage in the game, even more than WildTurtles 1x Penta, 1 Quadra 16/4/2 Jinx.  http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/TRLH1/1001040062?gameHash=69af528266947113&tab=stats  Week 6 (Loss) to GV  3/2/2 Jinx  3rd Most Damage Game, 2nd Most on the team, behind FeniX's Xerath   http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/TRLH1/1001040016?gameHash=d9538f2bc0c37e0e&tab=stats  Week 6 Final Game  14/4/2 Jinx  Most Damage in game  http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/TRLH1/1001040161?gameHash=7fc7f4aac6a34613&tab=stats    So what surprised me was how much Damage he did, he seemed to be the carry (sans one of the 6 games quas hard carried)   But ... He was in ""Protect the Jinx/Kog"" 3 of his games so he would be expected to carry said games, Its also interesting that as a Sub, TL had enough faith in him to play ""Protect the sub"" comps.  He also had a 9/1/12 game, and that based off of comp was far from a protected comp for the Cait. 1 of the Games on Corki he did well the other he did okay, but hard to judge because Quas carried that so damn hard.  This makes me wonder why more teams didn't look at him. It also does have the ""it was only 6 games"" too. Not long term consistency.  But it is interesting that until the playoffs, TL always played better with Keith than piglet. It makes me wonder why. Mechanically a better ADC? I doubt that. But maybe he was enough of a team player to make things work.  So jumping ahead. If Keith becomes the guy, it makes me wonder what a role he will have in the team. Can he be safe and clean up behind Bjerg? If he can we should be just fine in NA.  If, however he can be a consistent carry threat, things become more interesting.  All in all, I dont know if Keith can match Turtles high points where, when Turtle is on his game he is a very Good ADC. But, maybe if he can limit the lows then we can do very well.  Its just so, interesting to see a guy with such little LCS experience. This could work out well, as he certainly showed Talent in his time with TL.... Or he could just not work out and his flaws better exposed when he doesn't only have a 6 game sample size."

Objectively, Turtle has played pretty poorly in almost every phase of the game the last few weeks. We can't see their scrims to see progress, but TSM has a history that if they think about benching a player, they just DO IT (Xpecial, Chaox, Gleeb).  To your below comment where you mention they wouldn't put out this video unless it was serious...I think they just wanted us, the fans, hearing the news coming straight from them with their reasons instead of from a leak.

TeamSolomid,3asc6p,acethewarhawk,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:59:12 2015 UTC,There's also the chance they will just buy out the contract with Keith and have him start immediately.
TeamSolomid,3asc6p,myaccount101,1 point,Tue Jun 23 08:01:49 2015 UTC,"Right, I should have covered that better. I completely, Personally expect that to happen. Like I said. I don't think TSM would put out the video they did unless they were VERY serious. I also don't think they would put out a video, if they didn't believe Keith was a very likely candidate to beat out WT.  If this was purely only a motivation technique. Why announce it to the world? That doesn't help Turtle IMO, the internal pressure should be enough.   So yeah, im on the side Keith starts. Unless scrims go bad, or w/e to deter the deal, of course."
TeamSolomid,3asc6p,lurkedlongtime,24,Tue Jun 23 08:11:19 2015 UTC,Am I the only one here who doesn't want forgiven to join? He's the last person I want to have in TSM
TeamSolomid,3asc6p,Luminancee,14,Tue Jun 23 05:21:46 2015 UTC,"If TSM would go to EU, I'd want Freeze."
TeamSolomid,3asc6p,manslayer22,1 point,Tue Jun 23 05:28:03 2015 UTC,Forgiven is the last adc i want to pick up for tsm.  If you want to get one from eu id like Freeze/Hjarnan/Niels way more than forgiven
TeamSolomid,3asc6p,Cr4ck41,3,Tue Jun 23 06:28:42 2015 UTC,The way H2K and OG are playing right now I am not too sure either ADC would want to leave their team. CW are struggling for sure and Freeze will want to show what he can do on a big time team.
TeamSolomid,3asc6p,manslayer22,0,Tue Jun 23 07:28:38 2015 UTC,"Hell, you could even pick Steeelback up. He had a good showing before Rekkles booted him off FNC"

TeamSolomid,3asc6p,Cr4ck41,1 point,Tue Jun 23 07:04:38 2015 UTC,"if anything Forgiven has shown why you shouldn't pick him up while on GMB. He forces a style that would conflict with what the coaching staff want.   But if you want mechanics, Forgiven is damn good at playing his 3 champions"
TeamSolomid,3asc6p,Birdmann017,1 point,Tue Jun 23 08:36:20 2015 UTC,"ofc forgiven has great mechanics and a lot of pressure in laning phase but i think his personality wont mesch well with tsm and thats my main concern.  I think we'll slowly get to see, that he'll adapt to gmb playstyle and is capable of picking up new champs. Hell he even played Sivir this split.  It's not really a doubt in his ability as a player but more about his personality and attitude"
TeamSolomid,3asc6p,Cr4ck41,0,Tue Jun 23 09:13:31 2015 UTC,I'm surprised that more people are excited about TSM Freeze rather than TSM Steelback. I think that if TSM look internationally Steelback would be a really good option.
TeamSolomid,3asc6p,TheBubs4444,-1,Wed Jun 24 06:31:38 2015 UTC,"Can people stop this Freeze circlejerk? He isn't proven and rarely has good individual performances. He's all about ""potential"" like Altec. Steelback would be a much better upgrade than Freeze, because he proved him self with Fnatic. TSM's goal is to win worlds, they wouldn't replace WT for an AD who is potentially better.   At this point I'm really starting to believe this Freeze thing is just a meme."
TeamSolomid,3asc6p,myaccount101,6,Tue Jun 23 08:06:46 2015 UTC,"Freeze, like Bjerg was on his time on CW, is a strong player on an awful team. Literally the only reason they are competitive is because of him."
TeamSolomid,3asc6p,gahlo,-1,Tue Jun 23 21:00:54 2015 UTC,"They were never competitive, and Freeze is overrated. Just the thought of him joining TSM makes me want to puke. People really need to stop spamming this meme."
TeamSolomid,3asc6p,myaccount101,3,Wed Jun 24 13:20:50 2015 UTC,"Freeze is very often considered the second best AD is EU by many analysts and plays on a shit team, and still finds a way to carry them."

TeamSolomid,3asc6p,no_non_sense,4,Wed Jun 24 08:36:34 2015 UTC,"I agree. Through all the roster changes, TSM has remained full of likable people. Forgiven just seems like an asshole, and he has clashed with every team he's played on, so I doubt he's good for team atmosphere."
TeamSolomid,3asc6p,Montaron87,1 point,Tue Jun 23 11:03:59 2015 UTC,I agree Forgiven is annoying... and I don't like any of the EU ADC besides Hjarnan or Niels. Freese is overated.
TeamSolomid,3asc6p,no_non_sense,8,Wed Jun 24 08:45:44 2015 UTC,I would not be surprised if Keith is just a band aid for the ADC position. Regi and Loco could be considering using one of foreign slots on an ADC for the 2016 season.
TeamSolomid,3asc6p,Valcen,4,Tue Jun 23 03:38:15 2015 UTC,"They could, depends on Dyrus staying around for next season or what happens in regards to Santorin. Out of those 3 positions, I feel like ADC is the one position that TSM could seek out in region, and still get an upgrade. I'd be interested in Sneaky (depends how C9 turns out) or Altec being picked up."
TeamSolomid,3asc6p,BigMagic,6,Tue Jun 23 03:54:31 2015 UTC,"Tbh any adc TSM would pick up in NA isnt a massive upgrade to turtle, most games turtle is jus struggling in lane an then most of the time (until after MSI) he did fine in team fights and out of lane, the way sneaky is playing right now i wouldnt really find him an upgraade   an Altec seems happy with Gravity so i dont see that."
TeamSolomid,3asc6p,Birdmann017,2,Tue Jun 23 06:33:03 2015 UTC,I think sneaky is hurt by not having Hai to micro him TBH. His and Meteos' slumps are attributed to no Hai.
TeamSolomid,3asc6p,BigMagic,1 point,Tue Jun 23 07:00:47 2015 UTC,"That's how I feel. We know how they can perform under a shotcaller, Sneaky especially. Though this slump of theirs has made me hesistant on hyping them up as possible replacements."

TeamSolomid,3asc6p,FatTeemo,3,Tue Jun 23 03:51:16 2015 UTC,Turtle has the skills. I just don't get why he's so inconsistent. Plz Turtle.
TeamSolomid,3asc6p,ancienregime,3,Tue Jun 23 04:54:21 2015 UTC,"I think the ADC needs to be domestic - Altec or Keith pretty much, though maybe TSM Sneaky if C9 gets relegated? Honestly Chaox would be a great fit if he put in the work but i doubt fuckitbaylife is ever coming back. I'd look to KR for an upgrade to Santorin. A more aggressive ganking jungler will help the entire team dictate the pace of the game. Not sure on specific names though.""  Strategy notes.  Just have Bjerg play Azir every game until they take it away.  I'd like to see Dyrus build more offense now that he's getting more help and playing better - stuff like Cleaver/Mallet/Maw/tank on Gnar, maybe an Irelia or Ryze pick. Maybe you already have that ""carry top"" on your roster?  I think Lust needs to go back to his tried and true defensive supports unless Ali is open."
TeamSolomid,3asc6p,iChoke,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:59:09 2015 UTC,"I don't know what to think regarding the recent events.   On one hand, I recognize Turtle's under-performance and glaring problems in-game. It took him a while to get to Top 10 Soloqueue this season. He only recently started spamming solo-queue which is good from him. But he's one of my favorite personalities on TSM. He's definitely matured a bit -not as trolly- and I'd hate to see him go.   On the other hand, KEITH might be a breath of fresh air for the team and motivate everyone to perform better. He's a risky pick-up because he showed glimpses of potential, but the sample pool was so small.   Don't really know what to think about it, so I'm just impartial to either decision. Just gonna have to wait things out."
TeamSolomid,3asc6p,suicidalmoouky,3,Thu Jun 25 04:27:24 2015 UTC,"im not really sure if keith would be a breath of air, maybe in the long run he would be but everyone on TSM is so close to eachother if you took turtle out now it could hurt a whole lot in a short term time."
TeamSolomid,3asc6p,Badbaseball,1 point,Tue Jun 23 10:44:27 2015 UTC,"I hope Turtle gets back to shape, not only because I like him but also because I think he was the second best adc in NA last split, followed only by Sneaky. He was definitely a beast in IEM.  If he doesn't do well, and if Regi decides to pick someone from NA, I'd go for Sneaky, which would be an upgrade, but I don't see him leaving C9 anyway. Other than him, maybe Altec. The remaining adcs were as good as, or worse than, Turtle.  From EU I think Hjarnan and Rekkles would be great but they won't leave their respective teams, and Forg1ven might be good too, not sure how professional he'd be, but I'd trust the guy.  Other than those, I can't think of anyone from the west who could be a major asset for team, (definitely not Steelback) and I'm not very familiar with the eastern adcs apart from the obvious ones."
TeamSolomid,3asc6p,Luminancee,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:16:53 2015 UTC,So who will be starting this weekend then?
TeamSolomid,3asc6p,no_non_sense,1 point,Tue Jun 23 06:35:40 2015 UTC,Turtle.
TeamSolomid,3asc6p,ApexRayse,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:01:49 2015 UTC,Turtle will not be dropped before worlds... it will be stupid of TSM to do it. Unless they find some crazy talented player or experienced player it is too much of a risk at present. I have been following TSM since the beginning and trust the management but I will never be happy with Forgiven the guy is not TSM.
TeamSolomid,3asc6p,perfecthashbrowns,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:59:02 2015 UTC,I like Turtle.. Turtle will play for TSM. :)
TeamSolomid,3asc6p,Mrpettit,2,Wed Jun 24 07:11:29 2015 UTC,Turtle ;_; I hope he can step up but also honestly I'm excited for Keith. I hope he gets to play a few matches in LCS with TSM because I want to see how he performs. He's someone that I think has the ability to really perform exceptionally.
TeamSolomid,3arh77,Stickman41,4,Mon Jun 22 22:31:21 2015 UTC,I think your thoughts on the matter are correct. From the video it seems like Turtle is not putting in the same work as Dyrus did after MSI. Hopefully this move forces Turtle to put in the work. I also wish Keith good luck as well and since he no longer is in school he should be able to really put in all his effort.
TeamSolomid,3arh77,manslayer22,2,Mon Jun 22 23:43:13 2015 UTC,i personally loved how happy Keith was about his pick up and that he cant really believe that he's playing for tsm.  I think that shows how much work he's willing to put in. Hope Turtle will step up and wont be replaced tho
TeamSolomid,3arh77,Cr4ck41,3,Tue Jun 23 06:53:20 2015 UTC,"Of course this change is for the best, no one who thinks rationally can doubt that. The thing is, I just love turtle and it's extremely sad if he has to leave. I really hope he steps up, he is my favorite TSM player and can definitely improve if he wants to."
TeamSolomid,3arh77,dmml,-1,Tue Jun 23 01:51:27 2015 UTC,plot twist: it's another scripted event because tsm legends isn't doing so hot anymore. i.e gamecribs & chaox
TeamSolomid,3ar7p7,LiLNickyG13,6,Mon Jun 22 21:18:11 2015 UTC,"I've been thinking about this for awhile and i think sneaky is THE perfect fit for TSM, someone who CAN carry if given resources and can also play passively to clean up fights on a utility based adc."
TeamSolomid,3ar7p7,Limpy7030,2,Mon Jun 22 22:09:23 2015 UTC,"I know, if they combined, I think TSM could potentially be the best team NA has ever seen. By quite a mile too. Imagine the sneaky lustboy lane. You thought John Cena was scary...  Sneaky is just the best ADC NA by far though, I don't want TSM to pull an Elements."
TeamSolomid,3ar7p7,Hug_The_NSA,-1,Tue Jun 23 03:41:59 2015 UTC,by far both double and pig have performed better than him sneaky had immaculate possitoning due to hai SOTP RIDING DICK
TeamSolomid,3ar7p7,smallboss98,0,Wed Jun 24 04:30:15 2015 UTC,"Yes, every great thing C9 ever did was Hai turns out... They have zero talented players except for Hai... Keep telling yourself that.  Doublelift hasn't been top 2 ADC NA in a long time."
TeamSolomid,3ar7p7,Hug_The_NSA,0,Wed Jun 24 10:46:00 2015 UTC,"he is now, u keep telling urself but doublelift is better than anyone but piglet"

TeamSolomid,3ar7p7,smallboss98,5,Wed Jun 24 21:07:54 2015 UTC,they would have to pay him a lot more for him to consider leaving C9. there are also contracts and shit which i have no idea about. maybe if they bomb this season completely and dont get to worlds which will be really hard to do imo
TeamSolomid,3ar7p7,Xiryz,3,Mon Jun 22 21:24:14 2015 UTC,"If C9 get relegated i could easily see Sneaky, Meteos, and maybe Balls looking for new teams, the big if being c9 getting relegated"

TeamSolomid,3ar7p7,Vbpretend,2,Mon Jun 22 22:20:28 2015 UTC,What about Altec? I really think he would be great with the team
TeamSolomid,3ar7p7,Salcer,2,Tue Jun 23 03:14:16 2015 UTC,"Same here. I wonder how long he is under contract with Gravity. Plus being so young, can be a core piece of TSM for a decent while."

TeamSolomid,3ar7p7,viktorpls,7,Tue Jun 23 14:13:11 2015 UTC,wasn´t the reason people used to praise sneaky so much the amount work he did with little gold priority?  Back when Meteos was really dominant and taking a lot of gold and also balls being one of the more wealthy top laners people were saying how good sneaky still performed considering the small amount of gold he recieved.
TeamSolomid,3ar7p7,dunderbrunde,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:23:52 2015 UTC,"But more importantly, his gameplan requires lots of gold and plays to be funneled into him.   Uhh do you know what you're talking about?"
TeamSolomid,3ar7p7,-Acerin,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:44:26 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Sneaky (and the rest of C9) already gets along with TSM because of the relationship between the teams' owners and Turtle's friendship with C9 that goes back years ago. Sneaky also doesn't need as much gold as you seem to suggest, imo. He was certainly not the focus of the team in previous seasons yet he was probably the most consistent player in C9 and one of the best players in the west even before his ""level-up"" in S5. Also, TSM doesn't need a player that has the same playstyle as Turtle. TSM has historically adapted better than almost every team in history when it comes to roster changes despite the playstyle changes. The conservative Chaox to the balls-to-the-wall Wildturtle and the carry-top/bruiser TRM to the tank/ bruiser/supportish Dyrus (not counting the games he had on stuff like Jayce) to name a couple. Also, a veteran team like TSM and a veteran like Lustboy wouldn't let a playstyle change affect them so much.  While I would love Turtle to step up and stay on the team (my preferred outcome), Sneaky at this point in time would certainly not be a bad idea. I find it hard to consider arguably the best ADC that NA has ever produced to do badly/not work out in the best team that NA has ever produced."
TeamSolomid,3ar1w7,pokershark19,8,Mon Jun 22 20:34:53 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure you can switch mid series in the NA LCS too. The only problem is that LCS is only BO1s until playoffs. This means that teams can't practice having a mid series substitute and it's a big risk to do it during a playoff series without practicing it in a LAN setting.
TeamSolomid,3ar1w7,AZF1,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:00:30 2015 UTC,"Ah, that makes a lot more sense, thank you very much!"
TeamSolomid,3ar1w7,AZF1,2,Mon Jun 22 21:04:38 2015 UTC,:O Thanks for the gold! Glad I was able to help you out :)
TeamSolomid,3ar1w7,Hashmalek,2,Mon Jun 22 21:08:23 2015 UTC,"there is no rule (as you can see, CLG has subtitusion for pobelter, that they can pull in best of fives), BUT there is a problem, the torunament format, LCK has a format of best of 3 and they can swich in-betwen games, faker and easyhoon, but in the lcs the format is best of 1... there is no much to do there and if u think about it, there is no point on doing that in LCS regular split matches"
TeamSolomid,3ar1w7,Birdmann017,2,Mon Jun 22 21:07:24 2015 UTC,Maybe you can prepare a mid for one game and play the other so they only focus on a single opponent a week

TeamSolomid,3arctk,EastRicee,3,Mon Jun 22 22:56:18 2015 UTC,"Freeze is the eternal potential player and doesn't actually seem like a good fit in terms of playstyle. We need a Rekkles or even Steelback type player.   Keith himself might actually be pretty good, because of the low priority our botlane generally gets. So he just has to farm and be safe, in the same way TL used him."
TeamSolomid,3arctk,Montaron87,3,Tue Jun 23 11:07:50 2015 UTC,Except Keith got smashed in lane in every TL game his cs numbers were terrible
TeamSolomid,3arctk,KayleOnly,6,Tue Jun 23 18:00:44 2015 UTC,"I find it pathetic that someone would turn down a huge upgrade like Freeze just because they are not ""troll""."

TeamSolomid,3arctk,payingonlyinpennies,-3,Tue Jun 23 00:40:42 2015 UTC,"Forgiven would be a much better upgrade than Freeze, if they were to get someone from EU. Forgiven is proven, Freeze is not. Freeze is all about a player with a lot of potential that hasn't proven shit, kinda like Altec. People need to stop this Freeze circlejerk.   Having said this, TSM's goal is to win worlds, and they would rather get a Korean AD (which would also be better for Lustboy), instead of picking an EU ad up."
TeamSolomid,3arctk,myaccount101,5,Tue Jun 23 17:06:14 2015 UTC,"And Altec on a better team looks like the best ADC in NA with stats To back it up.

Seems like after MSI many things changed not only with TSM (realizing they can't leave Dyrus alone the whole game) but Dyrus, perhaps getting a burst of motivation.  Glad to see he's back to playing extremely well and fixing his reputation.  TSM is great because of their team dynamic. They aren't all Bjergsen's, but the way they work together is incredible.

Jungle  No, passive jungling barring a ""get to 6"" jungler like Sejuani is just straight up bad. The vast majority of the time, if the jungler isn't putting pressure on lanes, the opposing jungler, or sneaking dragons, they aren't having an effect on the game. This is compounded where Santorin has played passively on a power farming champion like Rek'sai and still fell behind in farm.  Support  Normally I'd agree, but Lustboy hasn't been playing well at all lately.  Unless Santorin and the bot lane get their shit together, this team won't do anything internationally."

I guess losing xpecial hit turtle real hard even though I think Lustboy is the best support in the west atm, their laning is frankly appalling for a team challenging to be ""best in the west"""

Lustboy better than Yellowstar even though Yellowstar has proven himself throughout FOUR World championships, and basically never having a terrible match, unlike Lusboy who himself has been struggling the last few weeks (everyone seems to be jumping on the ""turtle is the ONLY ONE at fault in lane"" circlejerk lately). About Bjerg vs Febiven: MSI was probably the only recent international event PACKED with mid-lane talent, and both bjerg and febiven played well. How can you say bjerg has an advantage over Febiven because he ""did fine vs the best""? Guess who also did fine internationally? Febiven. Oh yeah, while we're at it, let's all jump on the ""BUT BJERGSEN HAD 20 MORE CS AT 30 MINUTES NEARLY EVERY MATCH!!"" train. He was cho'gath playing against mostly assassins, of course he's going to do well in lane, that's what cho'gath offers to the table. Along with the huge burst. I love TSM but we can't deny that Fnatic is in better shape right now. Stop being delusional. TSM is probably going to recover from this ""slump"" pretty soon and prove themselves, but until then, we just have to admit that Fnatic (Hell, even H2k, Origen and CLG) look better than we do."

TeamSolomid,3ap34s,MyNamesNotObama,3,Mon Jun 22 10:14:32 2015 UTC,I think I would agree with you except that they seemed to be extremely disappointed after the two wins this weekend. Turtle especially seemed really upset with his performance yesterday right after the game. I think they will be reviewing these games as if they were losses and I think they will improve off of these games.

And if you've even played in a competitive environment of a sport or game, you know that even when you win, you can feel for yourself when your performance wasn't good enough. I expect that these guys have the drive to perform at their best so when they feel like they're underperforming, they will look for areas of improvement, regardless of the end result of the game."

TSM and na in general doesn't have that option,  especially because we don't have consistent bench players who play with the team often.  Also,  by benching bjerg you ruin one of the biggest problems this team has: synergy. Last split,  our TSM team was playing a lot more cohesive while we're now seeing a team that is one of the best mechanically in many positions, but need to find a better way to play together."
TeamSolomid,3ap34s,xxGamma,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:33:42 2015 UTC,"This is really interesting to think about. While I agree Bjergsen has single handedly pulled games out of the trash, there have still been glaring errors across the map before Bjergsen has to go man mode and carry. So I think a lot of the time the errors have already been made, and obviously made, before Bjergsen ""covers them up"" I mean maybe if they did actually lose the game it would make the errors more impactful rather than having the ""don't worry Bjergsen will make up for it"" mind set, but I am almost 100% sure Loco, Dylan and Parth do not want the players to think like that and likely reinforce the importance of said errors.. So while I agree that maybe Bjergsen carrying after an error may effect the way they view the errors, the errors are still there and I'd guess with TSM's work ethic and coaching staff just want to eliminate all errors (or as many as possible)"

But Regi isn't looking for good/nice guys he's looking for the best players at every role to give them the best chance to do well at worlds.    I am not surprised that TSM is at LEAST trying someone out for the adc role, I am more surprised that it is KEITH they are trying out.  I thought they would go for someone with more of a resume.  I have been an avid curse supporter, however, this split I have found myself liking TSM more and more.  I was quite wary of the whole Piglet/FeniX move and to be quite frank, I am still not sold on it.  I respect the hell out of Reginald as an owner - he makes the tough decisions and he does them swiftly and decisively.  I think him and Jack (c9) are the two best owners in the LCS and of all of the teams in the LCS who have not been living up to their standards, I am the LEAST worried about TSM."

That's what he shows at the start by using the neutral air several times in a row.  Then he talks about how mixing it up with a laser will work as a counter-measure against the stale moves mechanic.

Someone who can carry if given the resources but can play conservative and just clean up fights without getting caught out of position consistently.

TeamSolomid,3akq72,gahlo,2,Mon Jun 22 02:49:08 2015 UTC,People like you assume that the all star play maker is always the best for your favorite team. No. Just no. Every team needs role players and Dyrus is an almost perfect top role player. We already have are carries in Bjerg and Turtle. In the Top and Jungle roles we just need role players and Dyrus fits that role much better than Zion.

As time went by he has settled into his place and gotten comfortable with his surroundings. Done well with something he loves but most all all he has grown up.

TeamSolomid,3aahef,rohtarozer,6,Fri Jun 19 00:45:05 2015 UTC,"Yet more bullshit propagated about the Rain Man. He wasn't arguing to practice less, he was arguing for less scrims and more soloq. This came after their loss at Hannover, where he felt they got shit on in lane and it was nothing to do with team play, and that they needed to improve their individual mechanics, so soloq would be better. His reasoning was that scrims in this time period were very inefficient, as you would have to wait around for hours to get games started, people wouldn't show up/be late, etc."
TeamSolomid,3aahef,Sheriff_Skit,5,Thu Jun 18 15:48:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this is exactly what I was thinking as I read this post. After TRM leaving, I remember the majority of pro players and in particular regi, were commonly stating how ineffective solo q was and then proceeding to invest very little time and motivation into it. Regi ended up falling quite a bit on the ladder (I forget if it was still the elo system then or not but I remember he went down to somewhere in the platinum range.)"
TeamSolomid,3aahef,aznanimedude,3,Thu Jun 18 16:45:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Regi said their team synergy was bad, but TRM argued that synergy didn't matter because their individual mechanics were poor, and lost games in the laning phase. TRM was really frustrated playing top in this time. (he talked about it on stream a lot)"
TeamSolomid,3aahef,silentorbx,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:01:08 2015 UTC,"so were many people going against Darien/Moscow 5, who were just way too far ahead for their time.  i'll never forget the awkward time period where TSM was super convinced snowball was the comp of the future and spent literally months just trying to copy M5 style, and everyone calling them out on it/calling them delusional, and not realizing M5 were the only team with the ability to actually pull it off and make it work"
TeamSolomid,3aahef,Crownocity,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:40:12 2015 UTC,"Well to be fair, back then scrims were crucial and Regi realized this, because they (NA) were less strict about it, and teamwork and team play was what won games and he knew that.   If you go back and watch season 1/2 matches the teamfights looked bronze-level. So Regi actually did make the right call in saying scrims > solo-queue, because back then most teams didn't have a strict regiment for it yet, and Regi knew the key to becoming the best in NA was having the best teamwork. The first team to do that would win it all.  Now as you can see he wasn't wrong, they proceeded to be #1 for a few years after TRM left as a result. However it's unfair to compare it to season 5 where teams now routinely scrim together, and thus solo-queue practice has become important again."
TeamSolomid,3aahef,iChoke,0,Thu Jun 18 19:49:10 2015 UTC,"Yep. Regi was Plat for some time and got stuck in, I believe, silver for a few days when Elo was reset. Probably was because of his playstyle of ""Idgaf about my deaths because my team will win because of it"" didn't translate well in low Elo.   Even now I believe TRM was right in that they should have put more into soloqueue and less in scrims. Scrims back then aren't what they are now as strategies were much simpler then. TSM also streamed quite a few of their scrims at that time IIRC so the secrecy aspect wasn't really there at all. TSM was probably the most easily scoutable team in the world at the time. They somewhat fixed it at least when they made EU accounts where they may have gotten better soloqueue practice and scrimmed EU teams who were better than them."

TeamSolomid,39xnmo,xBlackfyre,-1,Tue Jun 16 02:57:31 2015 UTC,It's a widely known thing. HTC is all about what's on the outside and not what's on the inside.  Own a HTC phone or two and you'll regret ever supporting them.
TeamSolomid,39xnmo,hax_wut,2,Tue Jun 16 03:41:11 2015 UTC,"On the contrary, I've had an HTC one since release and when my contract is up in July I'll be getting an m9. I'm guessing you had some bad luck with your phone (if you've ever had an htc) since I've never had a problem in 2 years."
TeamSolomid,39xnmo,xBlackfyre,-2,Tue Jun 16 03:53:18 2015 UTC,"Here, let me also give an anecdotal example. My HTC 8X literally bricked right before my 2 year contract was up. I have never in my entire life ever had that happen to me. Ended up falling back to a 5-6 year old LG phone because of that bullshit."
TeamSolomid,39xnmo,hax_wut,5,Tue Jun 16 04:25:23 2015 UTC,"I originally switched to htc from samsung when I had a problem with their batteries bloating and losing charge after a few months. Is Samsung shit? obviously not, that was just an unfortunate coincidence. and a phone lasting almost 2 years is above the norm for celular device lifetimes on average"
TeamSolomid,39xnmo,xBlackfyre,-1,Tue Jun 16 07:04:45 2015 UTC,A 600 dollar equivalent of a laptop should not just completely die like that. Slowness and such I can understand but complete bricking is absolutely unacceptable.

TeamSolomid,39xnmo,xBlackfyre,0,Tue Jun 16 20:47:45 2015 UTC,"HTC only does 1 year warranty, so I do see a problem."
TeamSolomid,39xnmo,hax_wut,2,Tue Jun 16 21:04:18 2015 UTC,then you have yourself to blame by not looking att he warranty. they usually come with options to extend it to 2 years for like $15 which in the end cans save you that $600. most carriers have this.

TeamSolomid,39zelg,Lshrsh,14,Tue Jun 16 00:55:20 2015 UTC,"TSM has done it all, they've won it, lost it to C9 then won it back again. With TSM's continued dominance comes also a curse. The fans are not satisfied with the team stomping NA any more. They want what Regi's been promising for so long, they want international success. They want the team to eventually win Worlds. A lot of us back in S2 thought that TSM actually had a chance. They had won like 8 straight LANs. They got shit on. People said the next season. If not maybe the next one. And for years now we have been just waiting for the Asians to be beat. Every year we win NA, go to Worlds and get smashed."
TeamSolomid,39zelg,loveismine,2,Tue Jun 16 01:38:21 2015 UTC,"But I think the gap has been getting smaller and smaller. S3 no one could touch the Koreans (mainly SKT), S4 saw us getting a little closer, the games weren't as stompy and we were taking some games off of them. S5 international play so far has seen the gap as close as it's ever been. TSM took Katowice and Fnatic went to Game 5 with SKT. I think we are some small changes away from the West being truly competitive in League of Legends again."
TeamSolomid,39zelg,mpiet14,7,Tue Jun 16 12:23:24 2015 UTC,"Come on dude, Samsung White stomped everyone at Worlds last season."
TeamSolomid,39zelg,suicidalmoouky,-2,Tue Jun 16 13:49:38 2015 UTC,"SSB didn't even get a kill on alliance, a team who wouldn't make it out of groups. SSW who are basically considered the best lol team ever, dropped a game to us. This season, the best korean team just barely beat a rookie fnatic team who is still learning and growing. You are delusional if you think the korean dominance is  still a thing. They might still be at the top, but they are definitely not dominant anymore."
TeamSolomid,39zelg,LOLrusty,6,Tue Jun 16 14:11:19 2015 UTC,"First of all, I was talking about Season 4, and not Season 5. And, at season 4, SSW was miles away from every western team. They dropped a game to TSM because they got cocky, otherwise it would've been 3-0.  Secondly, I do agree that this season, due to the fall of SSW, the asian dominance doesn't seem as strong, and I think this is a great chance for the western teams to finally win something. However, calling people delusional just because they don't agree with your opinion is wrong and you should feel bad, because that's not how people have civilized conversations."
TeamSolomid,39zelg,suicidalmoouky,-6,Tue Jun 16 14:20:34 2015 UTC,What is wrong with you? Do you even know what the word delusional means if you got that offended by it?
TeamSolomid,39zelg,LOLrusty,2,Tue Jun 16 14:25:30 2015 UTC,I just found it terribly arrogant and arrogance is unnecessary and ruins conversations.

TeamSolomid,39zelg,GringusMcDoobster,6,Tue Jun 16 16:08:00 2015 UTC,"I would also like to point out that locodoco stated in the last episode of Legends that they aren't preparing for specific teams week by week anymore and they're just practicing their gameplay, strategy, and compositions.  Im not worried at all because TSM is playing to improve instead of playing to beat NA, we'll see the results by the end of the split and playoffs."
TeamSolomid,39zelg,xBlackfyre,4,Tue Jun 16 02:52:54 2015 UTC,"The only thing that matters is their development.   Keep in mind TSM implemented the Accountability thing. In-game decision-making should be a big adjustment for both Bjerg and the rest of the guys. TSM coaching has to adjust their approach to preparation since they got dumpstered in MSI.   That being said, I'm glad the TSM guys are playing a bit more soloqueue than before, especially Dyrus.   In the end, I'd rather see a developing TSM comparable to their S4 run."
TeamSolomid,39zelg,EnmaDaiO,3,Tue Jun 16 21:47:42 2015 UTC,"Nothing to freak about really...1-1 is not great but not horrible. Bjerg just learning ekko and was a beast on the champ, but the team obviously has some learning how to play around the champ left. Dyrus is dyrus, he had 2 more games where he had early leads/was put in good position to carry and they ended up losing to Dig and in the other game it got dragged out super late because they couldnt translate his early lead into a snowball.   Didn't think it was particularly a great week for any of them..woulda been for bjerg except for the 1 misplay in the Dig game and a cple small ones in the 2nd game."
TeamSolomid,39zelg,phaneuf_fan_3,3,Tue Jun 16 08:25:31 2015 UTC,"TSM's macro play has been pretty good all season, there have been some positional and micro mistakes that led to both losses. But they can be worked on.  My only issue is the pace that TSM go at, its a very slow style. But the entire of NA feels slow coming from watching EU lcs and playing on euw.  While in theory slow methodical style should be the best, i think MSI showed that a more aggressive risk taking style. I'd like to see TSM adopt some of that playstyle more."
TeamSolomid,39zelg,Tortillagirl,2,Tue Jun 16 08:55:36 2015 UTC,"It feels like sometimes we are too afraid of taking risks and making mistakes and we instead play a reactionary game that simply doesn't work well, especially against top international teams."

TeamSolomid,39x5ll,loveismine,38,Mon Jun 15 15:01:33 2015 UTC,"I have very little hope they make it out of groups. If they are the #1 NA team again their chances of not getting a KR team this year aren't high. They had a good group last year to make it, but they just aren't aggressive enough IMO. The best teams in the world put so much pressure on the map that I don't see TSM doing well.  Bjergson can play against the best, but he won't carry like he does in NA.  Lustboy can't dominate vision control like he does in NA against the best teams because Santorin can't put pressure in their jungles because Bjergson won't be shitting on the other laner.  Dyrus can play all right but he isn't going to be the reason TSM can win.   TSM isn't strong enough in each position to beat KR/CN teams. EU and NA is fairly even but FNC is stronger than TSM position to position. Origen and TSM are probably fairly close.  TSM has little to no chance of doing well at Worlds. The team needs to be more aggressive. Loco said during the Legends show this week that they were taking Dignitas and TDK for granted (basically) and weren't going to prepare. Look where that got them. TSM should be going completely HAM on these teams. Putting pressure everywhere, winning at 25 minutes and dominating. Instead, they are playing overly passive and cautious. Why? That play style isn't going to win on the international stage against teams with better players. FNC proved one thing at MSI and that was that playing aggressive can win you some games you shouldn't win. SKT is a much better team than FNC, but FNC is so good at pressuring early and snowballing that they took 2 games off them. TSM has zero chance at doing that against anyone. They don't even do that against the lower tier teams in NA right now.   They have lost all confidence after MSI, it is fairly obvious and instead of just pushing past it and learning how to play aggressive, they are hiding in their shells and second guessing everything.   Honestly, I could see them not winning a game at Worlds the way they are playing right now"
TeamSolomid,39x5ll,Suspense304,8,Mon Jun 15 15:18:17 2015 UTC,Welp.  That about covers it.
TeamSolomid,39x5ll,LoLCoderific,6,Mon Jun 15 16:53:03 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I could see them not winning a game at Worlds the way they are playing right now   With the way they play right now, they probably won't go to Worlds, if they do it will most likely be as a 3rd place team, which is the same tier as the WC teams. If they don't have a WC team in their group, as you said, they probably won't win a game at Worlds.  In an interview, IWD said that TSM plays very aggressive in scrims, and he was very surprised they played passively on stage. It's interesting and strange at the same time."
TeamSolomid,39x5ll,katnizz,4,Mon Jun 15 17:02:17 2015 UTC,I think in one of the legends episodes they say that they get stage fright or something like that but it still isn't an excuse

TeamSolomid,39x5ll,Last_of_me,9,Mon Jun 15 15:09:47 2015 UTC,The fact that so much emphasis is put on an early-game jungler like rek'sai only to see few ganks confuses me.

TeamSolomid,39x5ll,Kadmoz,8,Mon Jun 15 17:54:57 2015 UTC,"As someone who's watched every game of Ogn this year I feel like people highly over estimate the east ATM, I feel like SSW was still the best team to ever play the game and look At how close the west was to the east(alliance had a perfect game against the 3rd seed najin) people are talking about the strength of our players well you don't need world class players at every position, you need players that are serviceable, look at bang and wolf far from world class and they took EDG to game 5, FNC even took SKT to game 5 with Steelback the worst adc in eu at the time, najin has probably 1 of the better rosters on paper in Ogn and didn't even make it to playoffs in spring, honestly I think the regions are closer than ever, and I'm sure  everyone has heard montes rant about why western teams won't win worlds, but honestly I kind of disagree with him I think he has valid points but I think the strongest teams(especially in this meta) is the ones that have the best team play and communicate the best, and with half of China not even speaking the same language I think this is our best shot, is it a high probability, no. But still higher than ever. As for Santorin, I'll admit I thought tsms Msi performance was more of just a deviation from there normal play, but Santorin does need to improve you can be a passive jungler, look at bengi he's basically a ward bot, but Santorin is just often not in the right places, but I'm sure tsm is aware of all there problems and is working hard to fix them, TSM has had a bad month or so but have Hope, I know there performance was disheartning but FNC taking SKT has shown the west is catching up."
TeamSolomid,39x5ll,KayleOnly,6,Mon Jun 15 17:12:24 2015 UTC,This is great input. Also the first comment ive read here that sounds supportive and hopeful.   Important qualities of a good fan in any sport.
TeamSolomid,39x5ll,Enginecology,5,Mon Jun 15 17:38:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks, as a big football fan(go steelers) this is something I always found weird about esports people seem to only be fans when there team is winning, and the amount of hate tsms been getting I feel disheartened especially since this is where I come to talk about tsm since /r/leagueoflegends appears to be a shit show filled with people who think they know what there talking about, but I treat esports like a sport and that means any team can win any day, some of tsms criticism are justified bout apart of being a fan is being optimistic and hopeful, I feel like people forget that TSM is fully aware of their problems, I've always considered Regi the best Na Owner, the staff is doing everything in there power to win, if the staff has faith in the players than so do I, if our players weren't good enough or aren't motivate enough I believe Regi would make a chance, ie: xpecial/gleeb/chaox. I'll admit Santorin isn't the greatest but he's trying hard and people act as if there was a better option, only jungler I think that is better than Santorin that was an option is Meteos, however as esports evolve id love to see what TSM does with it's import spots TSM Freeze were him and WT actively swap(like faker/ezhoon) cuz I do think wt is a good adc, and possibly maybe an upgrade at jungle like sven, swift, or jankos."

TeamSolomid,39x5ll,aznanimedude,4,Wed Jun 17 02:11:32 2015 UTC,"Dont underestimate the mental aspect of TSM being crushed at MSI, since they havent looked very good after that. I remember sOAZ saying that FNC were never the same after their 0-7 losing streak in the LCS. No matter what they say or do publicly, that shit takes a toll on them both as individuals and as a team. Maybe they lost the trust they had in eachother after MSI? Or they start to question eachothers calls more than before. Atleast at IEM SJ they could say they had a new challenger jungler in the team. But the high expectation and the crash at MSI was probably devastating mentally and thats very hard to recover from."
TeamSolomid,39x5ll,Last_of_me,2,Mon Jun 15 21:46:46 2015 UTC,"very true, but ive always considered tsms players mentally strong based off there playoff performance, no matter what happens in the regular season or how rocky things looked or what i line up is, TSM tends to have that clutch factor, atleast in domestic play anyways."
TeamSolomid,39x5ll,KayleOnly,4,Tue Jun 16 01:27:46 2015 UTC,"bang and wolf far from world class   I don't think that's really fair to Bang, he's become a carry threat in his own right and had some really good games against CJ last split. I would say Bengi is more of a liability than Bang. I won't bother defending Wolf.  Regardless, I think that LPL is a much greater threat at Worlds than LCK is. I honestly think LCK and EULCS are on pretty much the same level right now (Fnatic is almost even with SKT and OG/H2K are quite possibly superior to CJ/JAG/KOO/KT.) On the other hand, so many teams in LPL are straight up god tier. EDG, IG, QG, OMG, Snake, LGD, VG...nearly flawless teams with world class laners in every position. (EDG is just ridiculously stacked, probably the best mechanical roster there has ever been, better even than SSW/Season 3 SKT.)  I can't imagine any of the teams LPL sends to Worlds losing a BO5 to any other region right now. When people talk about Eastern strength these days, they're mostly talking about China and SKT. Like, let's look at a sample matchup - TSM vs EDG. Which TSM player can become a carry threat and win this game? Deft/Me1ko would absolutely destroy WT/LB in 2v2 and Dyrus has no chance of getting ahead of Marin without jungle pressure, which Santorin almost never provides. Bjergsen would do well against and might even win lane vs. Pawn, but Clearlove can choose to camp that lane and make sure Bjergsen never gets strong, or he can just gank sidelanes over and over again and get Deft really strong.  By the time laning phase ends, EDG is probably up 2-3k gold at least. They can pick fights whenever they want because their teamfighting is near flawless. TSM could never win a 5v5 against that roster if they're behind in gold.  The only area where TSM might be even or slightly better is objective control, but if EDG can contest any objective freely or just take inhibs while TSM is getting baron/drag, it doesn't matter.  My point is that TSM will never make it through Worlds playoffs if they have to face LPL teams. Maybe if they have no Chinese teams on their bracket and someone else (SKT?) takes down EDG. A Bo5 against SKT might be close. But unless that perfect scenario happens, TSM has very little chance.  Bear in mind that the one time when TSM has seemed internationally competitive in it's whole history was at IEM earlier this year. Well, the only Chinese team there was the last place WE, who made it to the finals after dispatching both #1 and #2 seeds from LCK. I think that's a pretty good example of what I'm talking about."
TeamSolomid,39x5ll,CaptainLepidus,2,Tue Jun 16 10:40:07 2015 UTC,"Very good points. I watch very little lpl and my only knowledge is based off of there playoffs. And when i said bang wasnt world class by no means did i say he was bad, He has def. carried his fair share of games in their play off run i just wouldnt place him in my top 4 adcs in korea atm(ohq,pilot,fury,pray). and Honestly LPL isnt short on talent, Its just when I think of the games i see from that region they generally seem pretty sloppy(could be from all the games they play, ive heard the players care less during regular season). As for EDG they are a very strong team, there teamfighting is probably the best in the world, however I do think they have problems, you said TSM beat the last place LPL team, but WE took EDG to game 5(albeit with U) and EDG also went to game 5 with LGD who isnt doing so hot after coming in 2nd place. Which is what i think my main point is, its not that TSM is better than all these teams is just that all these teams have glaring weaknesses, None of the regions appear to be that far ahead of each other (especially when you have players like Pawn saying he thinks LCK is still the stronger region). So im not saying TSM is going to win worlds i just think they have a better shot than they ever had and i think there chances of getting out of group stage is decent, and at that point I think any one can take it. So, if your a TSM fan hope we can improve our play enough throughout the split to be a major threat, Dont sit here and doubt all of our chances 3 weeks in.   Side Note: If you dont think a team can turn it around in a split look at how drastically improved Samsung is from this split compared to last."
TeamSolomid,39x5ll,KayleOnly,2,Tue Jun 16 14:11:56 2015 UTC,"If TSM doesnt get a korean team in groups, they're most likely getting a top 3 chinese team which is arguably worse in Season 5 ( EDG, QG and iG) .   TSM Last year was the peak of the team, taking games off Royal club and Samsung. TSM could of possibly made Semi's if they hadn't lost to SK in their last group game. if they won that game, they would play a Tie breaker against royal club, which they beat before, and then face EDG in the quarters. EDG was in a pretty big slump with Namei under performing. say they beat EDG, They have to face OMG, which would probably be the hardest matches TSM would have to play during worlds.   TSM's best bet is to get a 3rd place KR team in groups, along with an EU Team, and a Wildcard team. For example last year (Najin Sheild, Cloud 9, Alliance, and Kabum)"
TeamSolomid,39x5ll,maxb38,2,Mon Jun 15 17:14:33 2015 UTC,"i think tsm is a multi game team, they can be cheesed really easily but are able to bounce back in a BoX series, also teams tend to reaise their game a lot in high stakes environments so they will definetly be going 100% at worlds. at least thats what i hope anyways."
TeamSolomid,39x5ll,Dragshisballsz,2,Mon Jun 15 21:32:31 2015 UTC,"A lot of things I don't agree in these comments. Last week, when TSM beat CLG and TIP without too many problems, the mentality was ""what a time to be a TSM fan!"" or ""Western teams are too weak, TSM needs stronger rivals!""; one week later, after a couple of games, TSM is suddenly crap. Seriously?   TSM are doing the exact same thing they did last split: playing their most comfortable team comps against the theoretically stronger teams (and winning) and experimenting new stuff against the weaker ones (and losing or barely winning). One of the experiments, as everyone saw, was Ekko.   Do people remember how TSM were during the spring split, just before playoffs, and how they also made tons of mistakes every game? Even their games against Team Coast weren't as clean as they should. Then TSM was going to play TIP in the playoffs and many people were scared (me included), and then TSM just stomped them.   Also, as everyone knows, they've been making a lot of changes in their communication and in their shotcalling, not to mention they're still recovering from MSI, so it was obvious from the begining there's gonna be a few issues in the first few games. But at least they're trying hard to improve, and I don't see any reason they won't. So I expect them to win this split, once again.   As for worlds, not really sure. I think they'll be able to go through the group stages and then it'll depend on who they'll face. Maybe they'll reach the quarterfinals but they could go to the semis if they're lucky."

TSM has been throwing a lot of games, against C9, against a DIG team with a brand new jungler, taking 47 minutes to beat TDK. I think we're still early on in the season, but this team has constantly stated that Worlds is the end-game goal. If we can't perform dominantly against NA teams (See Fnatic with EU teams), how can we expect to have a showing?"
TeamSolomid,39x5ll,Threemor,2,Mon Jun 15 16:27:51 2015 UTC,"Best player on TSM would be Bjerg, and he would be considered average to above average in the Asian scene, the rest of the team just falls short, mainly WildTurtl and Dyrus, I just don't at all see how TSM can go far"

TeamSolomid,39x5ll,krcnu,0,Wed Jun 17 18:48:53 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's time to accept that Loco is not the best coach in the world. I don't know, but it seems that compared to other coaches (Deilor for Fnatic, Leviathan when he was with Gambit, maybe Rico with Dignitas now?) he does not really produce significant results (recently, of course TSM is better with him than they would be without him). I don't know, but week after week even if they improve in some aspects they seem to regress in others.  Turtle and Santorin definitely need to improve. They should follow Dyrus' example, the dude's been working his butt off and it is showing. Lustboy keeps making weird mistakes in some games.  I don't think there's any point in trying to predict exactly how well they would do at worlds because I think it is very clear that they have no chance of winning atm.   In this meta you need a jungler competent in early aggression to excel. Santorin needs to step up and take responsibility for his role in the team. Bjergsen needs to learn how to use his pressure to help the rest of his team (he used to be great at that). Turtle needs to do a lot of work and grow into a real carry threat, not a clean up machine. They need to learn their ideal roles in the team and how to work with and around each other. And of course shot calling needs to improve.  I think they are making progress this split. It's just a little slow right now, but I have confidence in them (well three of them at least)."
TeamSolomid,39x5ll,NSFWIssue,4,Mon Jun 15 15:14:34 2015 UTC,"They need a different type of jungler in this meta. Santorin just doesn't gank.   Turtle isn't a carry and Lustboy doesn't initiate. Lustboy plays best on champions like Janna and Nami, the ones that can kite and play defensive. Dyrus is best on tanky support tops.  Honestly, this is a terrible meta for TSM, and it is showing. TSM should sign a few players as backups.   IMO, TSM should have a backup jungler that is incredibly aggressive. They should also look at finding an adc that can win lane. They should keep Santorin and Turtle, but they need to look for some subs that they can plug and play depending on the meta or matchup. IMO that is where LoL is headed.  If I were coaching or running TSM I would be wanting a team that could adapt to any team or situation. You aren't going to make Santorin an aggressive jungler or turn Turtle into a laning monster. What you can do is have backups that do those things. When you play against a team that struggles against early jungler pressure, you play the sub. Do we need to win lane in our duo? Plug in the sub. I think TSM should take what SKT is doing one step further and basically sign up subs for each position that can do what the other can't. Have an entire 5 man roster living in the house and scrimming against the starters. I think if they did that, it would get them closer to the Worlds dream."

TeamSolomid,39uja0,elkaj,48,Sun Jun 14 22:12:20 2015 UTC,Regi has a point. There is literally no reason for Travis to tweet that other than trying to put it in the communities eyes.
TeamSolomid,39uja0,Alvarez23,8,Sun Jun 14 23:17:06 2015 UTC,At this point TSM fans will back Regi and the rest will hate him. Nothing anyone can do will change that. Though it is great to see Regi deal with bullshit like this.
TeamSolomid,39uja0,BagelsAndJewce,11,Mon Jun 15 09:04:14 2015 UTC,"Travis was one of the people who told Thorin things about TSM's blackout on him. Regi had told him things in confidence, as friends, with the belief that it was between Regi and Travis. Regi felt as though Travis betrayed his trust and Regi and TSM had always gone out of their way to give Travis interviews even when they had just lost or had other engagements. TSM was not the one who was really gaining anything from the interviews, they've been one of the biggest organizations in NA for a long time, so when Travis spoke about Regis personal thoughts to Thorin he blacked out all of  their website. Travis keeps saying that TSM refuses to interview him and denies him conversations without providing the context of why because people without the knowledge will side with him."
TeamSolomid,39uja0,Viruszero,3,Mon Jun 15 13:07:47 2015 UTC,It's more than likely travis was making offhand comments or speaking to people at work and Thoorin was in the conversation or word just got to him about it all. Travis said once in a reddit thread that he had no intention of betraying confidence when he had said things but Regi has always taken trust and respect very seriously. I'm not saying Regi is completely correct in his reaction but I understand it.
TeamSolomid,39uja0,Viruszero,0,Mon Jun 15 14:00:45 2015 UTC,"Iirc travis didn't tell thooorin directly it was more of a both travis and thooorin worked for gamespot at the time.  As you said travis used to be able to interview TSM so what I imagine is gamespot asks travis where the interview is, and he has to tell them what happened, i.e. TSM has blacklisted gamespot/interviews in general. This information then gets passed on to thooorin since he worked for gamespot at the time too, and so then thooorin makes a fuss about it.  Since regi knew he only really told travis such information he knows travis told someone (and probably thinks travis told thooorin directly and maybe figured travis was being salty about it) and thus feels betrayed."
TeamSolomid,39uja0,aznanimedude,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:29:55 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm pretty sure that's what happened. Thanks for elaborating.
TeamSolomid,39uja0,Viruszero,6,Tue Jun 16 02:16:52 2015 UTC,That's exactly what he was trying to do. Reminding people that he's still not aloud to do interviews. It's normal for media to let it be publicly known when they're blacklisted by someone.
TeamSolomid,39uja0,BFOmega,4,Mon Jun 15 14:16:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the first time. The media doesn't do it every month or two for eternity."
TeamSolomid,39uja0,Suspense304,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:12:36 2015 UTC,"actually travis simply said he was denied an interview. journalists do it all the time. dont get me wrong, regi should be pissed at thoorin, but he doesnt work at ongamers, and travis had nothing to do with that...imho regi needs to get past that and move on."
TeamSolomid,39uja0,nickroseville,63,Mon Jun 15 00:19:42 2015 UTC,Don't get why Travis has to publicly announce this kind of information. He of all people should know how the community looks at TSM and their external media situation. Don't hate the guy but don't start any fire.
TeamSolomid,39uja0,beaniebees,13,Mon Jun 15 12:36:40 2015 UTC,It's common for journalists to note when they're denied media access for stories.

TeamSolomid,39uja0,Shadostruct,2,Sun Jun 14 22:16:08 2015 UTC,It's already public knowledge of the blacklist. Dude can talk about it if he wants. And Regi can interpret it however he pleases.
TeamSolomid,39uja0,NWCheeseHead,-10,Mon Jun 15 00:57:26 2015 UTC,"Because people might wonder why he never does anything with TSM ever. Better to clarify what's going on than to be blamed for anti-TSM bias (which he has been blamed for in the past). It isn't his readers responsibility to know all of TSMs policies, so he might as well tell them."
TeamSolomid,39uja0,NSFWIssue,9,Mon Jun 15 03:19:18 2015 UTC,"Well, he did make a statement during his interview with Zion and Aphro after the CLG vs TSM game about why he couldn't interview TSM. He should've privately messaged Regi or talked to him in person and asked if they could move forward instead of taking it to twitter where people are apt to talk shit about it like it's their business. Already someone is referring Regi to an ape with the Wukong comment. lol"
TeamSolomid,39uja0,Kisekirin,-14,Mon Jun 15 04:13:16 2015 UTC,"It is their business. TSM is making a conscious decision to keep out of the public eye by not giving interviews. They can't just hide that fact and act normal about it. It is not normal for a sports organization to do that for an extended period of time. There's not even any reason to hide it. Travis is just stating a fact, letting his fans know why he can't interview TSM - it is not for lack of trying."
TeamSolomid,39uja0,NSFWIssue,4,Sun Jun 14 23:17:06 2015 UTC,"In the end, it's Regi's choice whether to do interviews with OnGamers or not for the TSM brand, and if he doesn't want to bow down to the pressure, that's fine. Our demands to have him bow down to the pressure doesn't mean he automatically has to adhere to our whims. If it hurts the TSM fanbase, which people have a love or hate relationship with anyway, that's their choice. But they don't need to flaunt the already established fact like Travis does who has consciously used his position to try to get Regi to do what he (Travis) wants. They're not hiding. If people question about it, others let them know. Regi's never denied or tried to hide the fact that he doesn't allow TSM to do interviews with OnGamers as far as I know."
TeamSolomid,39uja0,Kisekirin,-2,Sun Jun 14 23:27:03 2015 UTC,"TSM has never tried to hide it, but they and their fans seem to get extremely flustered when people question it. If they aren't hiding it then who cares who talks about it? Travis just isn't allowed to talk about an ""established fact?"" Travis bringing it up changes absolutely nothing. All it does is inform more people about the situation, which you people seem to so strongly disagree with.  If Regi is fine with dealing with the repercussions of never interviewing with popular outlets then he shouldn't care who is talking about it.  I for one am glad that Travis continues to update us on the situation since TSM does not care to let their fans know anything other than what happens in heavily edited TSM Legends. At least we know he is still trying and hasn't given up."
TeamSolomid,39uja0,NSFWIssue,2,Sun Jun 14 23:30:50 2015 UTC,"Actually, you're wrong on that. It's not unheard of for publications to be blacklisted. TSM also isn't hiding it, they just aren't holding up a blinking sign that reads ""Fuck Travis"". People that are fans of Travis should know by now that he won't be able to interview TSM."
TeamSolomid,39uja0,gahlo,-9,Sun Jun 14 23:39:46 2015 UTC,"They didn't just blacklist ongamers (though that is how it started), they don't interview with anyone. And as I said, it isn't Travis' fan's responsibility to know about TSM's policies."
TeamSolomid,39uja0,NSFWIssue,4,Mon Jun 15 06:46:00 2015 UTC,They interview with multiple outlets but they dont gain much traction. They also seem to prefer interviews with non english speaking websites to diversify the brand
TeamSolomid,39uja0,drkumlaunchr69,0,Sun Jun 14 23:45:39 2015 UTC,"It is his fans responsibility to know who Travis is available to interview, if they are actually his fans. Whether it is a specific or general blacklist doesn't make a difference."
TeamSolomid,39uja0,gahlo,1 point,Sun Jun 14 23:55:49 2015 UTC,"I mean, you would know why TSM doesn't do interviews with OnGamers if you watched Regi's vlog about the whole situation around last year. It was already kind of public knowledge man. This isn't even directed to you personally, you probably already know why. Why does TSM have to have interviews, or any other filmed series with other orgs if they can just do it by themselves? (see, TSM legends)"
TeamSolomid,39uja0,PM_ME_UR_LEAGUE_IGN,34,Mon Jun 15 00:34:10 2015 UTC,Travis is pretty passive aggressive with that tweet but good thing Regi put him in his place.

They stream, they have their own show that comes every week for the fans, way before TL and Fnatic started it. That being said. Travis Gafford is a pretty cool dude, he has never been part of any drama. He simply reports and interviews players. I am sure many of you watch the ongamers interviews."
TeamSolomid,39uja0,Melicalol,6,Sun Jun 14 22:37:06 2015 UTC,"I like Travis. I like his interviews. I wish that he was able to do TSM interviews because I would watch them.  Having said that I get why Regi doesn't want his players to do them. TSM is his brand and the players and their personalities are a monitizable part of that brand. This is something that he realized long ago and is why we got things like gamecribs, TSM legends etc.   For most teams players doing these sorts of interviews with a third party can only help their brand, but TSM already produces content very similar to Travis' (drama, story lines and post game reactions are all a part of TSM legends). In addition to this Regi has no control over Travis' interviews, if a player says something that makes TSM staff look bad or that reveals info about how they plan then its up to Travis to honor a request to remove it.   By doing all content in house Regi maintains monitization of his brand as well as the ability to only air info that he is willing/wants to air.  I get it. Regi is very smart when it comes to the business side of things."
TeamSolomid,39uja0,chase2020,2,Sun Jun 14 22:12:34 2015 UTC,I expected them to smile and drink a beer together...why cant it ever be that simple
TeamSolomid,39uja0,redtoasti,7,Mon Jun 15 10:16:36 2015 UTC,"Because, and this isn't a straight criticism, Regi takes his bonds of trust and respect very seriously. He was infamous on TSM for using his authority to bully the players at times, and his argument with Dyrus about not snapping at people when tilting got him a lot of heat, because he demanded a certain amount of unquestionable respect as the team owner and captain. While he seems to have mellowed out as far as an authority figure, he has still made it clear that he places a lot of trust and faith in the people he works with and expects the same. He thought Travis was his personal friend that he could talk to without concern and did favors for on occasion. Travis betrayed that trust by telling things to Thorin and OnGamers during the Thorin blackout incident and Reginald is probably not going to forgive that for a very long time, and it only gets longer every time Travis brings it up."

TeamSolomid,39j8d3,Suspense304,1 point,Sun Jun 14 03:38:29 2015 UTC,Actually the new rule says you just have to declare which region you are playing for at the beginning of the split. Meaning if all of TSM declared for Korea then they would be fine. It just means that none of them could leave Korea for that year.

You can't just take these five players and suddenly tell them they're moving to Korea or China. Besides, FNC did pretty well in MSI and they played in the EU LCS."
TeamSolomid,39j8d3,CtuchikOfTorak,4,Fri Jun 12 07:09:39 2015 UTC,"Season 1 and 2 were NA & EU's only shot at worlds unless things change.  Riot has kneecapped the west in favor of creating a product.  Things hurting us currently:   Best of 1 format Underdeveloped Challenger/minor league scene Inability to compete internationally (MSI, IEM, and Worlds is only chance to better ourselves) Foreign player restrictions (this prevents importing of talent to an extent; which lowers overall skill of the region)"
TeamSolomid,39j8d3,pu55yslayer,3,Fri Jun 12 17:49:53 2015 UTC,There's the foreigner rule thing. There's also the problem of Riot not being happy about it and could possibly deny that it from happening. TSM could also possibly lose their LCS spot if they move over to another league.
TeamSolomid,39j8d3,nirdie,2,Fri Jun 12 05:20:32 2015 UTC,"Even if they moved to EU, they would have more competition (fnc, h2k, origen come to mind)"
TeamSolomid,39j8d3,ISODAK,6,Fri Jun 12 13:08:25 2015 UTC,"It's funny how fast this all changes.  Last year, TSM, C9, and LMQ were all better than FNC, ALL, and SK.  LMQ choked after their 2-0 start in groups, but they had an amazing summer split (4-0 vs TSM).  Then at IEM Katovice, C9, SK, and GMB all choked while TSM wonnered.  Admittedly, WE and YFW weren't the strongest competition, but they did take a game off CJ.  Then came MSI, where TSM choked and FNC took SKT to 5 games.  And now, sure, the top EU teams are dominating their region, but I expect some will fall off as I expect C9 and TIP to recover.  Overall, I think NA and EU are both pretty close, even when they leap frog from time to time."
TeamSolomid,39j8d3,ijkijkijki,2,Fri Jun 12 14:14:00 2015 UTC,"That's the problem with the League community, they are too dumb to interpret results correctly. TSM was the best team in the west since S4 World's until MSI and they proved this with several outstanding results. They choked at MSI and suddenly they're bad? Why would they even be bad? Nothing in TSM has changed. Nothing in EU has changed (before/after MSI), so where did the rearrangement of powers happen? Did EU as a region suddenly got better because Fnatic had 3 days of scrimming at MSI? I doubt that even Fnatic got that much better of these 3 days.  So let me tell you - the community - something. Nothing has changed. TSM is still number one and EU still sucks."

TeamSolomid,39j8d3,theguywithballs,2,Sun Jun 14 15:23:31 2015 UTC,"This thread and the SI ep. conveys exactly what I was thinking lately as well. Minus IEM WC, we have had little international success, especially at Worlds. If the split goes like it has been so far, we will win our 3rd back-to-back NA split.  And the question really is - what for? Winning NA at this point literally means nothing. It's the least competitive split in the history of NA LCS. Look at half of the bullshit teams we have to play. Look at the skewed LCS format of Bo1's we're wasting our time on just to play 2 lousy games a week.   Look at the deadbeat soloQ play.   If TSM was ever to elevate their play and they chances at winning Worlds they need to take their practice to the next level at LCK. If they can secure a spot there after S5 Worlds it would be a step in the right direction."
TeamSolomid,39j8d3,llshuxll,2,Fri Jun 12 14:02:15 2015 UTC,A chance at 1 million dollars divided among the company but might lose sponsors/fans/region domination.

TeamSolomid,39fmdk,manslayer22,15,Thu Jun 11 13:17:29 2015 UTC,"They have entertainment value, as they are almost always not so serious and focus more on the players personality."

TeamSolomid,39fmdk,manslayer22,2,Thu Jun 11 15:20:03 2015 UTC,Ehh some people in this sub just want to circlejerk about Travis being unprofessional and not entertaining.   Which is completely fine by me its individuals opinion after all but downvoting for an opinion is just stupid.
TeamSolomid,39fmdk,SilentNumberXIII,5,Thu Jun 11 17:22:14 2015 UTC,"Interviews with Travis are like Late Night/ Tonight show Interviews with Fallon or some other host. You dont learn much, but the subject usually becomes more likable. There are a place for them and they usually serve as an entry level experience to the player for new fans. I would not be a fan of TSM or have gotten into esports if it wasnt for Travis' interviews (Pluto as well, drinks with theoddone was really funny). It is a shame that TSM doesnt do long form interviews like Thoorin or even Richard Lewis, but Travis' style is still useful. He is like a gateway drug into the NA scene."
TeamSolomid,39fmdk,drkumlaunchr69,6,Thu Jun 11 17:34:46 2015 UTC,LCS contracts probably don't include a mandatory media interaction clause so each team can do as they please. Professional athletes have to interact with the media but then you end up with this

TeamSolomid,39fmdk,cubay,-6,Thu Jun 11 16:23:08 2015 UTC,"It's because of two main things.   Regi wants TSM to just focus on the game and not have to worry about the media. It's kind of similar to the way that their time spent on reddit, twitter, etc is limited. A long time ago, Thorin compared Regi to Ceasar from Planet of the Apes. This basically made it so that Regi didn't want to have anything to do with the website that Thorin and Travis worked for at the time(can't remember the name). So basically Regi hates Travis for seemingly no reason. There could be more to it though, I'm not sure."

TeamSolomid,39fmdk,Threemor,2,Thu Jun 11 13:41:47 2015 UTC,Didn't the boycot of ongamers and such stem from the leaking of Locodoco arriving to coach TSM ? (I may have things mixed up)
TeamSolomid,39fmdk,MarcoAlex,6,Thu Jun 11 14:08:40 2015 UTC,"If I recall correctly when Loco came to TSM he had a pretty blanket no social media rule so that players would not become upset reading/hearing criticism so he could work on fixing the problems. As such that meant no interviews. This was told to Travis, who seemed to be okay with it, who probably told his bosses and then Thoorin heard about it and mentioned the whole Regi Ceasar line and that is where the official boycott from Ongamers came from."
TeamSolomid,39fmdk,manslayer22,2,Thu Jun 11 15:15:28 2015 UTC,Regi and Thoorin thing actually started the mess and Regi told Travis that he won't be allowing OnGamers to interview his team. Travis then told everyone and Thoorin i think blasted him about it and Regi felt betrayed that Travis would just tell everyone
TeamSolomid,39fmdk,elkaj,0,Thu Jun 11 17:05:36 2015 UTC,"-Regi hates Travis for seemingly no reason.   Regi posted a vlog about the gleeb situation, wasnt satisfied with it and removed it. Travis reuploaded it, which understandably made Regi pissed. Now about the ongamers thing, Regi told Travis privately that he would no longer be working with Ongamers. Travis forwarded it to his higher ups (as he should. You need a reason when your boss asks why he isnt interviewing the most popular team in NA). Then Travis told Thorin (or his boss did, im not sure) which prompted an outburst by the SI crew. Travis isnt a completely innocent bystander but i think he was unfairly affected by everything."

TeamSolomid,39fmdk,CombatPretzels,3,Fri Jun 12 03:30:55 2015 UTC,"I dunno. But both parties [ongamers (and Travis, through Twitter) and TSM] have stated that ongamers have not been blacklisted. TSM has simply decided to take their rather large esports franchise and take all of their marketing and PR into their own hands. And unless Riot eventually forces LCS orgs to allow outside interviews, this won't change."
TeamSolomid,39fmdk,AcousticFishbowl,-1,Fri Jun 12 03:40:20 2015 UTC,People completely gloss over the fact that he compared Reginald to a character who happened to be an ape and jumped straight to accusations that he straight up called him an ape.  People can be so freaking petty sometimes.

TeamSolomid,39ehmf,leagueanalysis,3,Thu Jun 11 04:55:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the writeup!   I disagree with a lot of your points though. I don't have a lot of time to go over everything but I'll make quick points of the big things that I think you may have gotten wrong.  Santorin  His ganks seem good to me. I looked through most of the videos you link for evidence and I see nothing but good play. He doesn't wait very long when he knows a gank opportunity won't show up, and when he does gank he at least blows a flash. What is wrong with that? A successful gank does not necessarily mean a kill. Blowing a flash on AP Kog or an ult and flash on Rumble is huge, since they are both immobile champions and Rumble's ult is the main part of his teamfight strength.  I will agree though that sometimes in teamfights he prioritizes his own life and leaves early whereas someone like Dyrus will sacrifice himself if it means his team wins the teamfight. I think he does need to improve in teamfights.  Lustboy  I don't think you can counter Lustboy by forcing him onto a certain champion. There is no way you are going to pick/ban Annie/Alistar/Bard against him, and your suggestion of putting him on Thresh as a counter is a horrible suggestion. His Thresh, while it's looked rusty so far this split, has historically been very good.   Dyrus  How do you suggest putting him on a low initiate/non AoE champ, and then suggest giving him Maokai... If anything, I'd suggest to try to get him on Hecarim rather than Maokai, since that means he will need resources to be effective, which is not how TSM's current playstyle works. I think you are underestimating Dyrus's ability on a carry top laner simply because we haven't seen him on one in a very long time.   Dyrus's TPs have been historically very weak but he has been stepping up. His TPs in reaction to a teamfight starting are not strong but those are incredibly difficult TPs to pull off effectively. His engage TPs or re-engage TPs are often very good.  Wildturtle  You are straight up underestimating WT. He has improved drastically in his laning and teamfighting from previous splits, although he is prone to solo-queue flashes, which the coaches are trying to get him to stop doing. If given the chance, he can and has carried. This split he hasn't really had the chance to do so, being put on utility ADCs like Sivir or splitpushing as Vayne.  Overall I think it is very obvious that you are only taking the two weeks worth of games from this split and that it is not enough to get a good analysis on how they play as a team. I think another two weeks of games or at least until they show how they adapt after the next time they lose a game is needed to get a better analysis. I know you are aware of this as you mention it in your Considerations section, but I think it is a lot more important than you think it is."

TeamSolomid,396dbu,EastRicee,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:05:45 2015 UTC,"I am fifty/fifty about this statement.  Fnatic has indeed won a major, but TSM has won the last three tournaments, including a 3-1 victory over Fnatic on LAN. These two are without a doubt the top two teams in the world, but I feel like TSM pulls ahead by the tiniest of margins for that reason. For sure this is going to make Cologne a lot more interesting."
TeamSolomid,394r3n,Luminancee,2,Tue Jun 9 06:35:27 2015 UTC,"ATM, they're in contention to be the best team in CS:GO.

TeamSolomid,3944x9,Provokyo,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:45:02 2015 UTC,"A lay perspective:    I think TSM recognizes that their strength is not really in their individual skill. WildTurtle is often ranked lower than other ADCs in NA (like Doublelift and Sneaky). Dyrus doesn't usually come up in discussions of great tops the way Impact or Quas are. They probably recognize that individual skill is superseded by team play. As such, their early game strategy is to take whatever the enemy team gives them, like easy first bloods or silly misplays, but to not go after it. They, at a baseline, survive the early game in order to team up, group up and use their superior team synergy to trump the enemy.    The exception to this lack of individual skill is Bjergsen. Obviously, he is able to get those solo kills in lane and snowball his advantage. But TSM learned that when a team has a superstar, all you need to do is shut that one guy down. This current strategy of developing and rounding out their style is an effort to shore up their weaknesses and make the path to defeating them less straightforward."
TeamSolomid,3944x9,NSFWIssue,1 point,Tue Jun 9 04:45:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah I've been having that thought recently as well. They got crushed at MSI, but when they came back to NA it seemed like they just went back to their old strategy to beat NA teams (and honestly it seems like NA has regressed as a region since Spring split though I think the two new teams are notable improvements).  I would really like to see more calculated early aggression from them. To be fair though, they are doing some good stuff. Protecting Dyrus early, playing around top's teleport, that well-timed early gank on bot vs CLG, dragon and buff control. I think they are making good progress, they just need to do more more more"
TeamSolomid,3944x9,Baji-Naji,1 point,Tue Jun 9 05:58:54 2015 UTC,I think a large issue is the best of 1 format that supports and somewhat demands playing safer. It's not until a team gets a split lead or fall behind that they have more freedom to experiment (see the last 1/3 of last split).

TeamSolomid,38e569,Baji-Naji,0,Thu Jun 4 01:01:26 2015 UTC,I'd imagine it depends on what the underlying problem is. If it's carpal tunnel it probably won't do a whole lot. If it's sore muscles or inflamed joints than a little extra support probably isn't going hurt.

TeamSolomid,38bwfr,v1nchent,6,Wed Jun 3 09:16:36 2015 UTC,"I gave an upvote, because it's a valid oppinion.  However, you should try to give 'advice' in a more constructive manner. If you say someone should have done something, tell them WHY they should do it differently. It's like a student asking how to get to an answer and the teacher just giving the answer without the method. The answer is still correct, but the student learns nothing from it. Good luck in your future critiques :D"

TeamSolomid,38esfa,BigMagic,8,Wed Jun 3 19:06:36 2015 UTC,Hopefully TSM has worked out some of their communication issues and shotcalling. This week looks to be pretty tough. Both teams can be pretty aggressive early on. CLG seems to be in their usual beginning of split form and Impulse can take a game of TSM. 2-0 isn't out of the question if TSM can get out of this post Spring Finals funk they've fallen in to. Just hope they avoid going 0-2.

TeamSolomid,38c1i9,Xiryz,2,Wed Jun 3 09:57:23 2015 UTC,There isn't a set schedule or a set tournament host. They are also an EU based team so they end up playing most of their games while we are asleep :(
TeamSolomid,38c1i9,NotYusha,1 point,Wed Jun 3 08:10:08 2015 UTC,"Really? They generally broadcast the tournaments in the afternoon/evening here in Europe, which normally makes it around midday or early afternoon in the US."
TeamSolomid,38c1i9,AtomicDan,1 point,Wed Jun 3 08:55:42 2015 UTC,Yeah. Most of their games are during school but today is my last day and then I'm free most of the day
TeamSolomid,38c1i9,originade,2,Wed Jun 3 14:48:29 2015 UTC,hltv.org will have all the matches you need. They are usually around 11 am central and extend till like 4 or 5 central if they have a late game.
TeamSolomid,38c1i9,Maudane,4,Wed Jun 3 12:25:26 2015 UTC,"I watch about 80% of their games But they play across a lot of different online qualifiers and tournaments that it's actually really hard to keep up with them. It doesn't help that I think most people on this sub are from NA, which isn't helpful when trying to watch EU tournaments.   http://www.gosugamers.net/counterstrike/teams/10649-team-solomid I use this and check it everyday to see who when they play.  I do feel that the organisation can do a lot More to promote the CSGO team like they have been doing with Leffen and the league team because they're a bunch of great players and CSGO is a good easy game to get into.  (Sorry for the horrible formatting, mobile sucks)"
TeamSolomid,38c1i9,EastRicee,1 point,Wed Jun 3 07:01:41 2015 UTC,I think TSM needs to do a better job at promoting in general. How many times have you seen them tweeting about upcoming tournaments and games for our other teams? Maybe once or twice for the CS:GO team. They should be sending out a tweet whenever one of our teams are playing in a match. They should also be trying to promote the streams more and create content for all our players and teams. Highlight videos would be a really good start.
TeamSolomid,38c1i9,EastRicee,3,Wed Jun 3 07:06:30 2015 UTC,The majority of the subreddit are LoL fans and the majority of TSM fans are from their LoL team so it's not really surprising that the threads don't necessarily get a lot of traction. However an issue I do see with the subreddit is that there aren't really a lot of discussion going on in general. Maybe we'll have one or two post that gathers traction or the LoL post-match threads doing pretty well but other than that it's 0-4 comments on each post.
TeamSolomid,38c1i9,Zolkan523,2,Wed Jun 3 07:00:52 2015 UTC,there is an extension for chrome called abios esports match ticker that tracks all esports matches and it gives you a notification and that is how i find out about our csgo team and watch them its super helpful.

Does the NFL or NBA rate teams during the season?  If so then I'll admit my ignorance and remove the comment.  This is just something I expect from goldper10 or dailydot.

TeamSolomid,38bbi0,CtuchikOfTorak,2,Wed Jun 3 03:34:55 2015 UTC,The NFL at the very least pays plenty of writers to put out things like power rankings or other pieces like that during the season.  example  And many other opinion pieces are sponsored by NFL.

I got a slight worry DaZeD is right about TSM, but I can't wait for the team to prove him wrong, as they will be going all in on their CS GO careers now that everybody are finished with school! I think if this team sticks together and stays under the TSM brand, they definitely have the capacity to be a top 2 team in half a year or so."

Dignitas always had the same core (with the occasional quick swap) until Karrigan replaced Fetish.  Since then they've quit choking and are playing consistent and without one off gimicks to win."

The only reason TSM lost that game was b/c they split incorrectly at the last dragon.  TSM controlled and won out on all the dragons that spawned.  You can't do that with a strictly inferior comp.  The only other possible point of contention was Bjerg didn't get as much roam off as he would have probably liked, considering his sizeable lead."
TeamSolomid,383v4s,CtuchikOfTorak,3,Mon Jun 1 18:49:24 2015 UTC,"Nothing good has ever come from this GP10 website. The people writing the articles either have no idea what they are talking about or just try to be controversial. Which reminds me a lot of when I hear thorin and monte speak on summoning insight, they talk as if they have such a high understanding of the game, yet would rank up to be silver if they actually played."

TeamSolomid,383v4s,LOLrusty,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:04:22 2015 UTC,Except like I said game knowledge doesn't equal rank/skill in game.
TeamSolomid,383v4s,TheRevTastic,-3,Tue Jun 2 19:01:20 2015 UTC,Monte is actually really good and used to be challenger.
TeamSolomid,383v4s,plazasongs,3,Mon Jun 1 21:03:33 2015 UTC,That's not even slightly true.
TeamSolomid,383v4s,LOLrusty,2,Mon Jun 1 21:14:04 2015 UTC,I don't know TSM had a major lead in mid and let themselves get out rotated. This is what frustrates me more than splitting because they've been out rotated before by worse teams. I think this has been one of their bigger problems but it's only been shown in two or three games in this entire year (NALCS).   In my mind there is no reason C9 should have been able to get into the position where a poor split would cause us the game had they not given up every turret for free. Every turret tsm got was forced by an action and every turret c9 got was pretty much free with the small fee of running away or maybe one dragon.   They don't get that gold they don't get the items on kog where he can dumpster us.
TeamSolomid,383v4s,BagelsAndJewce,1 point,Mon Jun 1 21:51:38 2015 UTC,"I agree that we got out rotated, and too many turrets were given for what appeared to be free.  That is a common problem that we're trying to shore up.  I do feel like at least we are getting something for our lack of rotation now though.  We are focusing on the correct objectives (dragon and baron) and so far have proven dominant in acquiring them.  If we give 6 turrets to get 5 dragons, I'm generally going to be ok with that.  B/c we will likely have at least 3 turrets in return.  Overall I'm not sweating a loss to whom I consider to be the 2nd best team in the league.  I am sweating worlds where weaknesses like we displayed in the Cloud 9 game, will turn into stomps rather than close games."
TeamSolomid,383v4s,CtuchikOfTorak,2,Tue Jun 2 03:17:47 2015 UTC,To me I never really viewed top as an issue and I didn't really view pick/ban phase as an issues either. It's just sometimes we give up way too much for nothing. And at worlds if we do that we give up the game. So I'd rather be in the position where we're behind than constantly stomping. So that c9 game while it hurt to watch I was fine with it cause I knew this was a necessary step. Same with MSI. That was a necessary step to winning worlds.   This entire shit fest that happened over on /r/leagueoflegends I ignored cause I knew if we won that we'd be crowned the winners before it really mattered. We need to get our ass handed to us as many times as possible so prepare for worlds.

TeamSolomid,380wuy,Helian7,8,Mon Jun 1 01:10:36 2015 UTC,They're just doing it by alphabetical order.
TeamSolomid,380wuy,CountBasil,10,Mon Jun 1 01:56:17 2015 UTC,we're in 2nd place with a 1-1 record but the pic shows us tied for 3rd with the rest of 0-2 teams despite having a 1-1 record
TeamSolomid,380wuy,phokingnguyen,0,Mon Jun 1 02:48:10 2015 UTC,"It's not alphabetical, Enemy Esports are above C9 and C becomes before E in the alphabet."
TeamSolomid,380wuy,Accurized,3,Mon Jun 1 09:04:23 2015 UTC,"The proper ranks would be: 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 9, 9.  Liquid and CLG are tied for first with 2-0 records, but since there are 2 teams tied for first place, the next possible rank is 3rd. So teams 3 through 8 are tied for 3rd. Teams 9 and 10 can only be 9th place or better.    TSM is actually ranked properly. NME is ranked improperly at 1, and the two bottom teams are also improperly ranked. Riot doesn't hate tsm, they just have someone doing rankings wrong."

TeamSolomid,37fnem,Montaron87,5,Wed May 27 07:41:02 2015 UTC,"C9 is honestly the only team I'm scared of this season. I think that the upside Incarnation has laningwise is way more impactful than the shotcalling Hai brought. From what we've heard, shotcalling duties were being transferred already for them, so I doubt C9 will be much weaker on that end.  I don't think any of the other teams have improved enough to make life hard for TSM when it comes down to it."
TeamSolomid,37fnem,katnizz,5,Wed May 27 10:35:43 2015 UTC,"I think C9 will be weak but will get stronger and stronger, and will be very strong in playoffs. I think TIP and TL can get there too."
TeamSolomid,37fnem,kennnnyyy,2,Wed May 27 19:31:44 2015 UTC,"I wish the other NA teams would have improved over the break. TSM needs to face more hard-to-beat teams to prep for international. I think right now, only C9 can offer that to TSM."
TeamSolomid,37fnem,Lshrsh,2,Wed May 27 13:50:49 2015 UTC,Really? I think they'll have an adjustment period. Incarnation is still an unknown factor. If TSM loses Tomorrow I think it'd have to be really poor play on their part. Unless it's clear that C9 just comes out beasting.
TeamSolomid,37fnem,mpiet14,1 point,Fri May 29 18:27:59 2015 UTC,"I think it's way too early to judge C9. We have no idea how C9 is going to play with Incarnation, it's not like you can just plug any good solo queue player in a team as an upgrade and expect it to make the team stronger. They are replacing Hai, their main shotcaller and, according to Monte, one of the best shotcallers in the world. He was also the founder of C9 and undoubtedly the team leader both in and out of the game. Replacing him with someone else who has only proven to be mechanically better than him in solo queue could result in literally anything happening. They could completely fall apart for all we know. Don't forget, solo queue success does not necessarily relate to professional success."
TeamSolomid,37fnem,Montaron87,2,Wed May 27 14:21:38 2015 UTC,"I know, but I wasn't judging their performance, I was predicting it.

I fully expect TSM to be top 2.  I still wonder why people bother betting against TSM when it comes to playoffs.  My rankings would be TSM, Liquid, C9, TIP."
TeamSolomid,37bylh,MidWestSalsa,3,Tue May 26 14:36:59 2015 UTC,"This website has so many random articles that I stopped trying to read anything they post there at all. Which sucks because there's a few good writers in there aswell, but I get the feeling they're like 10%.  As for rankings this split, I expect TSM to end 1st and Cloud 9 to end in 2nd place. Both teams may have a weak start, TSM because they'll have to try a few different things in light of what happened at MSI, and Cloud 9 because they'll have to adapt to Incarnation. However, I think both teams will finish the summer split in a good shape: because TSM will have more strategic diversity and better team play and C9 won't have Hai underperforming because of his injury.  As for 3rd place I'd say probably Liquid, because they're very solid, and in 4th I have no idea. Maybe TiP. Probably TiP. None of the other teams look that strong but we'll only know that once the season starts, obviously."

TeamSolomid,37bylh,Lshrsh,2,Tue May 26 16:10:29 2015 UTC,I really like how at the start of every split they try to find a way of not putting TSM number one. I remember when the LCS first started and everyone just said TSM was bad. Well they fixed that and from that moment on they haven't done anything to warrant exclusion from the top 2.  I know Liquid is finally coming into it's own and that TiP is pretty strong as well. But they should never get it twisted. TSM is the reigning champ and that deserves some respect no matter what happened at MSI.   1.TSM  2./3. C9/Liquid  4.-10. Rest.

I'll agree that an untested incarnation is risky, but welcome to picking up rookies.  Everything I hear indicates that he's very good, but it also sounds like someone has to pick up the shot calling.  While Hai's leaving some big shoes to fill, if anyone can bounce back, it's C9.  Liquid does look strong, but I don't think they're #1 material.  I think losing 3 straight games to C9 after being up 2-0 shows a lot of weakness on their part.  After that, their series with TIP was rather close, despite the obvious difference between TIP and TSM.  I think Liquid has good players, but I don't think they're there yet.  I'm guessing we'll all still agree that TSM will likely hold a #1/#2 spot.  I think #1 is likely.  This article pointed out that going to Camp Dyrus was TSM week spot but failed to recall that that is what happened in pretty much every TSM game during spring split.  These teams are not good enough to exploit it and finish a game against TSM consistently.  This hasn't changed just because TSM was tilted all MSI."
TeamSolomid,37bylh,pujolsrox11,1 point,Thu May 28 23:31:02 2015 UTC,MSI exposed their greatest weakness and I'd lose hope in TSM ever winning anything meaningful if they do't return fixing that. Coming into summer TSM just has no risk involved as does TL. TL imploded twice during playoffs and still managed to comeback after falling 2-1. Out of all of the playoff teams TL looked like they actually got their shit together after a truly rough season with Piglet finally getting accustomed to NA.  I think they all have problems but TSM's/TL's are easier to solve than TiP's and C9's. I dislike articles like this because they don't accurately weigh their issues. They look at incarnati0n as a major bonus which he is but there are still many more problems surrounding him that probably out weigh the benefits in the short run. And losing the first few weeks of the regular season can lead to crucial matches in playoffs that you just don't want to play. While they focus on TSM's issues like they're impossible to fix which out of all of them they aren't. They have on major in game issue while the others have dynamic issues.

So Oddone is a streamer as well as the one that goes to events.  I didn't get a chance to speak with him personally at PAX East, but he was hard at work taking pictures and signing autographs and such. Basically promotional work. He looked really exhausted there as well, but I guess when you're busy for most of the day it takes a bit of a toll on you."

It does make the Lustboy and Santorin situation interesting though. I'd imagine after Worlds we will see Dyrus retire if TSM can get a good international top laner.

TeamSolomid,36wulk,manslayer22,6,Fri May 22 19:56:56 2015 UTC,True. Just wanted to clarify that it doesn't mean I don't believe in Dyrus. I still think Dyrus can be what Looper was for SSW and be one of the best in the West. Just interesting situation after this season.

TeamSolomid,36wulk,Suspense304,3,Sat May 23 00:20:22 2015 UTC,Actually I wish TSM would just give a top challenger player a shot. NA recycles the same people and then drops them to lower teams. There is probably talent there that we never see because NA is so imbalanced in terms of team skill.
TeamSolomid,36wulk,manslayer22,2,Fri May 22 20:04:07 2015 UTC,Like challenger player as in solo queue or challenger player from the challenger scene?
TeamSolomid,36wulk,Suspense304,2,Fri May 22 20:24:05 2015 UTC,Solo queue.
TeamSolomid,36wulk,manslayer22,8,Fri May 22 20:26:16 2015 UTC,"I actually disagree with that then for the most part. TSM is not your average LCS team, they are a team that aims are higher than LCS and that means that the player who they pick up does not have to get used from the transition from solo queue to competitive play. Now if they find a solo queue player who's benefits outweigh the learning curve, then that is cool. However with the mentality that TSM has I do not think they should just give a player in a region where solo queue is a bit more trollish a shot just because they are an NA team."
TeamSolomid,36wulk,Suspense304,-2,Fri May 22 20:33:29 2015 UTC,"I think the whole idea of ""rookie"" is completely overstated in this game. It's just an excuse people use to justify people playing poorly.   How would we know if NA has any good solo queue talent? Who is the last player from solo queue taken by a decent NA team? The major issue is that the challenger scene has been a joke. If the challenger scene were done like the LCS the solo queue talent would rise. The players in NA almost know that no one is looking for them so they don't even try. The challenger teams have almost no chance of winning the LCS because the teams have been around awhile and already have the better talent overall.  It would take the best five solo queue players to get together and be able to work together for us to see something happen and that isn't likely. I know there are better players in NA, they just don't go pro, and in my opinion it's because they know there is no one looking at NA's solo queue."
TeamSolomid,36wulk,manslayer22,4,Fri May 22 20:41:19 2015 UTC,"Being a rookie and having rookie tendencies is just a truth no matter what you look at. Even the best rookies, like Andrew Luck, still had moments where they looked like rookies because they are. It is not an excuse for a poor performance, it is a reality that rookies do not know how to react in certain situations because they have never been there before. It has nothing to do with what game is being played, it has to do with experience. Furthermore, when you take someone that has no competitive experience at all it takes a while for that person to understand how the game should be played. Look at Rush, he came straight from solo queue and was terrible the first half of the split. Once Rush and the rest of Impulse started to mesh they became a lot better, but Impluse was a brand new team and so learning pains were expected. That is not TSM though.   And the excuse, ""oh NA teams do not pick up solo queue talent so why try hard"" is straight up a bad one. If players wanted to show teams that they have talent then solo queue and the challenger scene is the place where that is done. Dyrus himself has said if there was someone to replace him then he would retire. That does imply that there is just no top lane solo queue talent.   I also realize this is a cycle where if players do not think teams are not watching then they do not take the game as serious and as such teams will not watch because it seems as though solo queue is trollish. To break that cycle either a lower LCS team or challenger team would pick up a solo queue player or a solo queue player will show that they mean business.    I hope that teams do start picking up talent from solo queue, but the players themselves have to show some effort in this too and that is by trying to fix the attitude of solo queue in general."

To break that cycle either a lower LCS team or challenger team would pick up a solo queue player or a solo queue player will show that they mean business.   You called my reason bad and then agreed with it in the next paragraph you wrote.  Comparing an NFLRookie to  a League of Legends rookie is just awful.  In the NFL players are faster, stronger, the schemes are more complex and every thing is enhanced. Every single player you play against is different, it is a completely different game from College.  Compare that to Solo queue in LoL compared to LCS. There are a few things you need to learn, lane swaps, communication, etc. But individually you are playing against the same players. Individually there is no difference in terms of skill. The learning can be done in scrims. The ONLY thing that may take some time is playing in front of a crowd. To that, I have already said, some people have it, some don't.    It is not an excuse for a poor performance, it is a reality that rookies do not know how to react in certain situations because they have never been there before   Actually, it is an excuse. It is LITERALLY an excuse. It's called a ""Rookie Mistake"" for a reason. People are excusing the mistake due to the person being a rookie. That is the definition of excuse."
TeamSolomid,36wulk,gahlo,1 point,Fri May 22 21:25:16 2015 UTC,You also have to take into account that challenger/pro play is a team game and it's called soloq for a reason.
TeamSolomid,36wulk,phaneuf_fan_3,1 point,Sat May 23 10:53:22 2015 UTC,"Good talent shows through, whether youre on a good team or bad. Calitrolz was a solo q guy before T8 won their way in. Another good example is Altec.......He consistently had top 3 ADC stats despite his team sucking and getting relegated."
TeamSolomid,36wulk,rodrigo8008,1 point,Fri May 22 21:29:01 2015 UTC,"too lazy to read much of this text, but i think a lot of the challenger soloque players end up on challenger teams...where they're beat by other challenger players who are beat by the shitty LCS teams. NA soloque just can't compete with the rest of the world, for the most part."
TeamSolomid,36wulk,BagelsAndJewce,2,Fri May 22 22:12:19 2015 UTC,"That will never happen. TSM is the Real Madrid on NALCS. They have the money so why settle for some farm team scrub when you can go out and buy who ever you would like.   The list is endless and the money, fame and power are all there. If they set their eyes on a European player Bjergsen and Santorin will lock him up if they choose a Korean Lustboy and Loco exist for a reason.   TSM has set themselves up for the perfect situation when and if the roster does blow up.  It wouldn't surprise me if we end up with a Korean botlane and Europeans elsewhere. I don't know if I'll still be around for that iteration of the team but I do no for sure that no unproven talent will ever be on TSM again."
TeamSolomid,36wulk,BagelsAndJewce,-1,Sat May 23 01:20:07 2015 UTC,I don't believe letting Dyrus go before a major international accomplishment would be the right business decision for the organization.   From everything he's ever said as long as he is still able to play and hasn't won a championship he's not going anywhere.   Dyrus feels like that last root tsm has to this region. A legendary player and the only way I can see him going out is with a world Championship.   If he does leave I do not believe it will be on good terms as much as they can split on good terms the brand will definitely take a massive hit.
TeamSolomid,36wulk,phaneuf_fan_3,4,Sat May 23 01:22:34 2015 UTC,TSM Flame Hype lets go!!!!!
TeamSolomid,36wulk,LuCactus,3,Fri May 22 20:56:34 2015 UTC,"To me it seemed like ""Santorin still has to prove his worth and longevity as a top player""  so they didn't do anything there, and ""Dyrus has to get back into top condition and we dont know how long until he wants to retire anyways"" so him getting back to form will have him re-signed imo.  Although I would agree that getting these options for TSM may have been the reasoning behind specifically how long these new contracts were.  Makes me wonder ""Why turtle"" then however. He's a great player with room to improve, but not near top international player and no signs of it yet. Unless it was something behing the scenes, maybe his work ethic is just great enough. We know he soloQ's a ton. Maybe he specifically wanted job security, although not expected of him.   Overall great move by TSM though."
TeamSolomid,36wulk,suicidalmoouky,3,Fri May 22 20:38:34 2015 UTC,"Well, Reginald said the only thing that could get a player benched would be the attitude, as in lack of motivation, so I guess they're sticking with Turtle as long as he keeps working hard."
TeamSolomid,36wulk,suicidalmoouky,1 point,Fri May 22 21:06:51 2015 UTC,"Plus Turtle may not be the best ADC in the World, but his NA LCS numbers are fantastic."
TeamSolomid,36wulk,CaptainLepidus,2,Sat May 23 04:49:15 2015 UTC,"Indeed, he's not the best but he's still great."
TeamSolomid,36wulk,gahlo,1 point,Sat May 23 16:40:02 2015 UTC,"He doesn't do so hot in 2v2s against the likes of Sneaky, DL and Piglet but TSM want to 2v1 almost always so I think his bad laning is made up for/disguised by his good teamfighting (no Corki ""equalizers"" from this ADC lol)"
TeamSolomid,36wulk,redtoasti,2,Tue May 26 14:16:47 2015 UTC,"Korean commentators rated Turtle highly at S3WC. Granted, Season 4 saw him take a major dip albeit with a revolving door at support but his play in S5 so far has been a pretty big step up from that."
TeamSolomid,36wulk,phaneuf_fan_3,1 point,Sat May 23 10:56:07 2015 UTC,"I doubt they'd make a change before worlds is over. Im pretty sure they are currently weighting toplane strategies and if they work in summer and on international stage, I think they're gonna stay with dyrus and santorin"
TeamSolomid,36wulk,phaneuf_fan_3,1 point,Fri May 22 19:56:19 2015 UTC,Honestly it will depend how Dyrus does at the start of this split combined with what top laners they could legitimately get who would be an upgrade. If Dyrus goes back to playing like last year where he still gets ganked over and over but finds a way to LIVE through them hes probably fine. If he continues like the first split this year & MSI and everytime he gets ganked he dies I could for sure see Loco/Regi making a change if they thought there was a better option.
TeamSolomid,36wulk,TSMCIB,1 point,Fri May 22 20:59:34 2015 UTC,The changes were kind of always in the works werent they? Wasn't it known that after 2 years the players would be able to gain residency prior to today? I feel like I read that somewhere about 18 months ago and thought ok so Bjerg/Lust will be NA at this point and more Koreans can join.
TeamSolomid,36wulk,theguywithballs,1 point,Fri May 22 21:01:41 2015 UTC,Dyrus and Turtle wont be replaced unless they retire (why?) because I just don't them getting benched and if one them retire I hope they don't get NA or EU replacement and just go for a Korean
TeamSolomid,36wulk,BagelsAndJewce,2,Fri May 22 20:16:35 2015 UTC,"Going for mechanically good Koreans seems like a good idea at first but you have to keep in mind that TSM probably wants someone who's English is also passable. Bjergsen/Santorin are both fluent (like most EU) but Lust had it's fair share of trouble. I remember watching Bjergsens stream after S4 Worlds and on his stream he was watching an interview with Lust when he was on holidays in Korea where he said that he works hard to improve his English and Bjerg said - well hopefully he will be able to say more than just 'kill bitch X or Y' in games/scrims in a frustrated tone.   I mean his English has gotten a lot better now and he can even speak without the paper, but team communication now is more important then ever before and you have to be careful picking players that could hold it back because it will also affect team environment."
TeamSolomid,36wulk,OmegaApple,1 point,Fri May 22 22:00:03 2015 UTC,"Koreans are always a possibility with loco and lustboy on the team but something less than reignover english wise would just set TSM back. And they can't withstand that set back in a years time. When Incarnati0n, Liquid and even CLG may have sorted out their issues. They'ed dig themselves too big a hole especially if two positions get altered."

TeamSolomid,36wulk,AdvancedWin,2,Fri May 22 22:14:46 2015 UTC,"Turtle got his contract renewed until 2018 though, so he'd have to shit the bed hard to be put in a situation to be replaced by Freeze."
TeamSolomid,36wulk,CaptainLepidus,0,Fri May 22 23:23:31 2015 UTC,Well with the rule change about midweek sub's they could rotate turtle and freeze around depending
TeamSolomid,36wulk,gahlo,1 point,Sun May 24 00:11:05 2015 UTC,I don't think it's worth doing that in botlane where synergy is so important. Works for mid and probably top too but I don't like it in bot or jungle.

TeamSolomid,36u8cx,thack1,11,Fri May 22 04:25:34 2015 UTC,"Dyrus mentioned he was gonna retire after they win worlds, Maybe they want to get a better feel for santorin before they extend him."
TeamSolomid,36u8cx,akim1026,4,Fri May 22 04:43:11 2015 UTC,"I think this is the case for Santorin. As much as I like him, he has only been in one LCS split. He needs a bit more time for such a contract extension."
TeamSolomid,36u8cx,manslayer22,2,Fri May 22 05:35:26 2015 UTC,"The flipside to that is that Santorin could be keeping his options open, and not wanting to tie down to a single team for that long.  Could also be another Amazing issue where he'll get homesick =("
TeamSolomid,36u8cx,CtuchikOfTorak,3,Fri May 22 05:47:24 2015 UTC,"I think santorin has a much healthier mentality than amazing. If you follow his tweets, the guy is much more optimistic. Also he is given less hate (for now at least) from the comunity"

While he did play well, it's not like he played so damn well that they have to lock him up long term.  Also the only players who got 2018 extensions were Bjerg and Turtle as Lustboys original team contract was through 2018. I'd love to see the terms on the contracts though."

TeamSolomid,36u8cx,CtuchikOfTorak,2,Fri May 22 20:02:03 2015 UTC,I guess Santorin still has to earn the contract extension :|

TeamSolomid,36ba4q,IkomaTanomori,5,Mon May 18 02:29:46 2015 UTC,"Same here, although if I were in his situation what I'd be doing is playing soloqueue too, although without his success. Playing LoL has basically become my base state and, although I wish I could, I don't do it for a living. In that way I think I'm similar to Dyrus; I can just play LoL a LOT, while many others play it here and there, or all at once then stop."
TeamSolomid,36ba4q,Gemeye,3,Mon May 18 02:32:53 2015 UTC,"I'm pursuing other life goals so I don't have a lot of time for LoL just because I'm working on my projects so much, but because of that, I understand the situation. I have a similar ""base state"" in regards to my game designing projects."

TeamSolomid,36ba4q,CaryGrantLives,11,Mon May 18 06:34:23 2015 UTC,"91 games in last 6 days. Yep, he took Regi fucking seriously"
TeamSolomid,36ba4q,am3nn,3,Mon May 18 11:15:48 2015 UTC,Holy shit 91? i play 91 games in 3 weeks. Thats honestly such an eye opener about how serious he's proving that MSI was just a fuck up and still has that season 2 carry top laner in him
TeamSolomid,36ba4q,BanjoSingaiJoe,15,Mon May 18 17:01:18 2015 UTC,"wild turtle plays but doesnt stream and its killing me :c he should grind rank 1 again, its good knowing my adc inspiration still has it in him to get rank 1 through all the flak he gets."
TeamSolomid,36ba4q,BanjoSingaiJoe,2,Mon May 18 02:31:15 2015 UTC,Which account does he play on?
TeamSolomid,36ba4q,katnizz,2,Mon May 18 04:29:00 2015 UTC,"A decent feature of LoLking is you can add your ""favourite"" accounts to a list (unfortunately caps at, I think, 10), and then it tracks them even through name changes, etc. Make a LoLking account, add his accounts to that list and you can track his soloq games. It's useful since he has so many."
TeamSolomid,36ba4q,katnizz,3,Mon May 18 09:55:12 2015 UTC,"The thing is that I know his 4 accounts, Wildturtl, Wildturtle, Long Cat 4, and Turtle The Cat, and the last game Turtle played on these 4 accounts is 15 days ago. That's why I was wondering of /u/BanjoSingaiJoe knows another smurf of Turtle, since he said that ""wild turtle plays""."
TeamSolomid,36ba4q,BanjoSingaiJoe,2,Mon May 18 13:21:22 2015 UTC,zzz he doesnt play on his accounts at msi when practicing/solo queue which is the last time he played.

TeamSolomid,36ba4q,xDrayken,19,Mon May 18 04:04:53 2015 UTC,"Everyone in the team has been spamming SoloQueue. It's something that TSM has put up as a new rule, that they have to play a LOT more SoloQueue and Duo Queue after MSI."
TeamSolomid,36ba4q,SavageConcordia,10,Mon May 18 00:09:13 2015 UTC,"True, but if you look at Bjerg's accounts (both l am Bjerg and Ekko cat) he hasn't played since 3 days ago, and he's been at the gaming house the same amount of time as Dyrus."
TeamSolomid,36ba4q,mrkerrydouglas1,11,Mon May 18 00:13:44 2015 UTC,"They have an off week to do whatever they want to chill, afterwards whether they like it or not they'll have to spam SoloQueue ontop of the rest. Dyrus is going to Disney for his last off day."
TeamSolomid,36ba4q,Waffleshot,22,Mon May 18 00:20:29 2015 UTC,That's my point: they have time to do whatever but Dyrus is already spamming soloq because he wants to get better. That's what's so admirable about his mentality.
TeamSolomid,36ba4q,guacamully,6,Mon May 18 00:22:49 2015 UTC,He has also been doing ranked 5s with Team Counter Solo Digers with Santorin so hopefully this is helping the communication between the two.

It was just how can we improve going forward. The whole thing was pretty calm and logical compared to what's going on with CLG.

I have full confidence in our players and staff that this won't be the start of a CLG situation for TSM after watching this, which is something that was in the back of my mind after our MSI performance and us losing the same way every game. Here's to hoping TSM pulls it together and finally gets Regi that world championship he has always wanted so badly!"

TeamSolomid,367r0w,Bearrison_Ford,2,Sun May 17 00:56:22 2015 UTC,"Same, that and if Loco didn't stop Bjerg after the SKT game (I think?) it seemed like Bjerg was about to go on a rant about his team feeding or w/e. He said something along the lines of, ""People are just getting shit on and dying everywhere."" If he gets into a mindset where he thinks he needs to 1v5 (the Doublelift affect maybe?) and loses confidence in his teammates there's no going back. Otherwise, yes, my hopes are high as well <3 TSM!"

TeamSolomid,367r0w,AZF1,4,Sun May 17 00:20:37 2015 UTC,I love this series because it doesn't shy away from the negative sides of TSM like when their players act out or get really upset. The fact that Regi and Loco still try so hard to keep everything in line and everyone looking at every loss as a learning experience instead of burying themselves. It keeps my faith in TSM alive.
TeamSolomid,367r0w,Austinkan96,5,Sun May 17 01:16:21 2015 UTC,"First: T S M!!!! Second: Anyone else get kinda get the feeling like they put a lot of blame on Dyrus? I realize that communication was a problem for them at MSI, but still after his speech on both is vlog and this, you get that kinda feeling. Third: I think Regi, Loco, and the staff handled it very well, and I loved that they didn't allow the blame game to be played right after the game, well done boys.

TeamSolomid,363c4o,EastRicee,7,Fri May 15 19:22:52 2015 UTC,"While this is a fairly generous viewpoint compared to what the rest of the world has expressed so far, I wonder if it's possible that TSM just had a bad showing at MSI, and that this one event shouldn't be taken as proof of how far behind NA as a region is? I mean, most people felt the same way after IEM Katowice, that yes - TSM did win, but it wasn't an accurate depiction of their skill level overall."
TeamSolomid,363c4o,tomato-andrew,1 point,Fri May 15 19:46:56 2015 UTC,Broad over generalizations with little evidence to back it up.  Did TSM screw the pooch at MSI?  yes without a doubt.  Does that make NA an elo hell?  not even close.  The problems TSM had are not endemic to the region as a whole.  Replace what he says with the results from IEM and you could make the exact same argument only saying that EU or KR were the weak regions.  Of course no one would believe that because we see the fallacies inherent in such statements.  Does NA have plenty of room to improve to catch up holistically with the LCK and LPL?

TeamSolomid,360pit,manslayer22,5,Fri May 15 03:06:58 2015 UTC,"I mean it's not like we didn't know about these issues before link opening the gates. It was expected, just an unexpected method of delivery."

TeamSolomid,360pit,CraftyStraw,5,Fri May 15 14:01:24 2015 UTC,"Link left CLG and wrote a 17 page letter about their problems and what drove him to leave. It was years of built up frustration and it was brutal. He talked about how bad the team environment is and really ripped into doublelift. And now everyone is responding -  nien (agreeing with link)  doublelift (agreed on some points but shot down a lot of what Link said)  Chauster (can't remember what he said, got bored reading it)  Xpecial (sticking his nose in for some reason) Thorin (1.5 hour long video, seriously who has time to watch that?)

TeamSolomid,360pit,Amielia,1 point,Fri May 15 14:25:49 2015 UTC,Oh okay. No need for links. I saw all these things you are talking about but somehow missed Link's thing. I was just confused what everyone was going on about.
TeamSolomid,360aj3,AzureCatalyst,7,Fri May 15 00:31:33 2015 UTC,"Damn, 1 and a half hour talking about TSM and every single thing they said was true. Everything went wrong at every level, from coaches to players to analysts. Micro and macro play. Everything, including the ""throw Dyrus to the wolfs"" as we all know. Amazingly, Thooorin didn´t bash too much so there´s that lol  Nothing to be mad about, watch it if u are curious"
TeamSolomid,360aj3,uirishbastard,2,Fri May 15 11:44:59 2015 UTC,"I agree, this was surprisingly tame. Compared to Thooorin's video on Link, we definitely didn't get trashed as hard as Link did."
TeamSolomid,360aj3,Mmh_Lasagna,2,Fri May 15 15:51:40 2015 UTC,"I think the idea is not to trash here, but more to comment and criticize (for entertainment purposes).  Hopefully they use the analysis."
TeamSolomid,360aj3,Hongxiquan,5,Fri May 15 19:54:16 2015 UTC,Apart from implying Bjerg is trash the show was really good and pretty much pointed out what has already been said about TSM at MSI. I loved Prolly/Monte discussing chaos vs control styles.
TeamSolomid,35y9ef,katnizz,21,Thu May 14 14:53:52 2015 UTC,There is no drama because Regi always makes resonable decisions
TeamSolomid,35y9ef,redtoasti,7,Thu May 14 16:32:59 2015 UTC,"Benching Xpecial for Gleeb still hurts my soul though.  I know they got Lustboy later, but ughhh.  I do think that Gleeb is probably the only mistake on Reginald's record and that was probably due to some communication between the C9 and TSM organizations.  I do not think that TSM would have picked Gleeb over other candidates if Jack/Charlie/someone from the C9 organization recommended him highly.  All in all, I do think that Reginald has done an excellent job with TSM brand from a roster/competitive standpoint."
TeamSolomid,35y9ef,AzureCatalyst,4,Thu May 14 22:19:15 2015 UTC,"Although, when gleeb laned with altec, he looked really good. It was a poor decision results wise, but gleeb is a very decent player and its safe to say that other factors affected his time on TSM, more than just his play at least"
TeamSolomid,35y9ef,AzureCatalyst,3,Thu May 14 23:29:22 2015 UTC,"gleeb is a very decent player    That in and of itself is the problem.  It's TSM. You shouldn't be picking up ""very decent"" players. You are aiming for Worlds.   The fact that the best Gleeb was ""decent"" is a problem already.   If you're aiming to be a world class team, the fact that one of your pickups was ""decent"" at best on a NA level is a worrying sign.  I do think Gleeb is a ""decent"" player, but TSM shouldn't have picked him up in the first place. He was unproven on an international stage and he failed to perform even on at the top NA level.  Picking up unknown talent and developing them shouldn't be something an established team like TSM should be doing. They should be picking proven players off of other organizations. Let Coast or Winterfox ""develop"" Gleeb. TSM should have been signing proven players like Aphromoo, Lemonnation, Bunny, Krepo, Lustboy, Kasing, Vander, etc."
TeamSolomid,35y9ef,AzureCatalyst,1 point,Fri May 15 00:17:49 2015 UTC,"Not much of a counter argument, I just wanna support our players by all means... We have different mentalities as fans but I entirely see your approach and desire to see TSM achieve greater things."

(unless you're their mother or something)  I support the guys, and I point out issues and mistakes when I can.   If all we do as a fanbase is to serve as an echo chamber of positivity for the team, then they only have themselves for criticism and critique.  I think it's unhealthy to go to either extreme whether it be too positive or too negative, and I think MSI is a great thing to bring TSM back down to earth after their recent string of successes."
TeamSolomid,35y9ef,elkaj,2,Fri May 15 00:30:42 2015 UTC,"Even if it didnt work out, it still was a resonable decision, xpecial had to go and they needed to pick a new talent. Gleeb was the best choice, nobody could know he had problems performing on stage"
TeamSolomid,35y9ef,mpiet14,1 point,Fri May 15 07:05:46 2015 UTC,I think Gleeb was a good choice but the wrong time to pick him up. No one knew Gleeb had bipolar issues in till he clarified wat happen in TSM. And TSM has all the right to try out a new player in the scene. Santorin is new in LCS and  his done well and with experience he can be the best jg. I also think it's good for the scene if team don't just pick up veteran players.
TeamSolomid,35y9ef,mpiet14,10,Sat May 16 03:22:58 2015 UTC,This makes me nervous to see what Dyrus is going to write when he retires. He is always saying how he has so much to say and will lay it all out when he retires.

TeamSolomid,35y9ef,thewoodendesk,8,Thu May 14 17:10:29 2015 UTC,"I think you're right. If you think about it, how many players/coaches have quit (not been fired from) CLG compared to TSM? Everyone that's left the TSM organisation has been removed by management for good reason, whereas there are multiple CLG members/coaches that have chose to leave. That should say a lot about the differences between the two organisations."

The TSM back then was definitely not as organized as the TSM we have now."
TeamSolomid,35y9ef,KitKatxz,2,Thu May 14 23:49:54 2015 UTC,"Dyrus has always publicly praise and support Regi, so I wouldn't worry too much about that."
TeamSolomid,35y9ef,-GregTheGreat-,12,Thu May 14 19:24:45 2015 UTC,"Lol, people saying cloud 9 is the most respectable lol exports team in NA  and tsm is very immature are wrong. Whenever we drop players we don't have any drama or anything cause the org always knows to only drop a player if they have to. The only bad thing the management actually did was just call out Monte on Twitter and then link story just  supports that. Other than that I truly believe that tsm is very  respectable team with barely any drama to its name."
TeamSolomid,35y9ef,Daeavorn,3,Thu May 14 15:05:38 2015 UTC,"ahem  We have never had any drama with drop outs, primarily because our whole team was so great the only change we had to make was because of a wrist / lung injury affecting our mid laner's ability to practice Although I don't really see why TSM as a team is considered immature, I've really only noticed salty fanboys at times"
TeamSolomid,35y9ef,TheBurritoNinja,4,Thu May 14 18:25:29 2015 UTC,"Not offending cloud 9, just their fans always say their team is so respectable and the only well managed team in na when that's cleary not true. I love cloud 9 but some of their fans are very snobby."

TeamSolomid,35yda0,xxGamma,6,Thu May 14 15:24:21 2015 UTC,"TSM tends to get complacent whether they like to admit to it or not.  They lost at San Jose - they came back and dominated the entire spring split, play-offs and IEM World Champion ship.   They lost at MSI  - they will most likely come back to dominate summer split and hopefully it will extend to Worlds.   What worries me the most though is when they do lose they just get completely rolled over and smashed. Like for whatever reason it's not even close, and honestly games from San Jose and MSI were so incredibly bad that they were difficult to even point down and analyse and you wonder whether they even learned anything.   I'm also scared that this event exposed them like never before and I worry that the team/coaching staff has lost their trust in Dyrus to carry or perform under pressure since they showed 0 incentive in helping him what so ever.   I have a feeling that if there is an event and they perform like they did at IEM WC then they can easily go all the way, but if they for whatever reason don't show up, they won't get past groups regardless of the teams they play.  I think a sports psychologist could go a long way in preparing their mentality when going into big tournaments like this."
TeamSolomid,35yda0,theguywithballs,2,Thu May 14 16:00:29 2015 UTC,"It seems to me that whenever they arent out and out favourites they play really scared and intimidated. Then once they lose, their mentality is crushed so yeh a sport psychologist is probably a really good idea..  I just hope MSI didn't crush them too much and they come back stronger than ever summer split and worlds"
TeamSolomid,35yda0,NSFWIssue,3,Thu May 14 16:35:15 2015 UTC,"I really really really really really wish people would stop using MSI as an excuse to put down Bjergsen or to say that TSMs ""mid priority"" style does not work.  Santorin ganked mid lane once the whole tournament. Once. You can't say whether or not the style worked because they didn't use that style. They didn't use any style...besides maybe the 4v5 style"
TeamSolomid,35yda0,alfie678,1 point,Thu May 14 17:09:40 2015 UTC,"Well if you look at all the mid lane match ups (in a vacuum, 1v1) Bjerg won against everyone except PawN, almost solo killing faker in the process.   What I'm saying is that TSM don't need to camp Bjergsen, in almost 90% of games Bjergsen will be good enough to win his lane or at least go even without jungle help. I just feel as though they are wasting Santorin's time and basically just saying Bjerg is the only player we trust with a lead to win us the games. If that is the case, TSM really need to develop the ability to trust their players more and trust Bjergsen to hold up on his own so Santorin can help out the not so strong laners.   I'm not saying that mid priority doesn't work, I'm saying that if a team knows you're gonna play that way, they're just gonna camp Dyrus and Turtle and put them out the game.."
TeamSolomid,35yda0,Suspense304,1 point,Thu May 14 17:15:44 2015 UTC,"I think that, early on in MSI, TSM were trying to use a different strategy (as seen as multiple times Santorin went bot lane, trying to work away from Bjerg and help side lane) ... but when things were not working, Bjergsen maybe made his case to return to mid priority (very similar to early in the season with TSM Legends, when Bjerg was frustrated with new strategies...)  In this case, I think TSM failed to stick to their initial win conditions established pre-MSI, and devolved into the TSM that was good enough for the NA Scene, but definitely not good enough for the international scene.  Moving forward, I think TSM has the game plan, but maybe not the mental fortitude plus the support needed to maintain mental fortitude in pressure situations."
TeamSolomid,35yda0,gahlo,3,Thu May 14 23:54:07 2015 UTC,"We can only hope that it serves as a wake up call for worlds and that they use this as an excuse to work even harder at fixing whatever their problems may be.   They really just need to be on the same page. I think they have been trying to work Bjerg on to more mids like cho'gath as we saw in NA LCS. TSM just hasn't figured it out yet. Why have Dyrus play Hecarim if you are gonna leave him on an island 1v2 getting camped? They aren't used to the playstyle so hopefully there is enough time to work out the kinks.   I do think Santorin reminded us all and himself that he is still a rookie and that IEM wasn't exactly world class competition. His lack of pressure, especially on champs like Gragas who are supposed to be able to gank early, was really hard to watch. It is still on everyone as a team though. I have faith they will pull through by Worlds. They could work on their lane swaps though ;_;"
TeamSolomid,35yda0,gahlo,1 point,Thu May 14 21:10:06 2015 UTC,MSI didn't exactly have the toughest competition of junglers either... I mean Clearlove was the best.  IEM may have actually been stronger at jungle than MSI. Santorin just didn't show up anywhere. Only they know what happened.
TeamSolomid,35yda0,gahlo,2,Thu May 14 22:26:51 2015 UTC,"Not that I'm any less of a die hard TSM fanboy now, but MSI pales in comparison to S2 worlds and how hard that was to get over :(   I could go full on rant post mode about how/why season 2 worlds were much harder.  MSI is really just a stepping stone for the team and many of the points you made I feel the same way about them."
TeamSolomid,35yda0,suicidalmoouky,2,Thu May 14 23:40:35 2015 UTC,"Yeh that was tough times indeed, but the hype surrounding TSM, hailed as the best western team and the only hope against he East, to then to get crushed, like crisps under bison, was embarrassing and I hope a wake up call that something has to change. Back in season 2 there was very little infrastructure to western teams so it was hard to improve, but now, given the developments in team structure etc, they can (maybe/hopefully) make the necessary changes to live up to the hype..

TeamSolomid,35x0bj,SnoopRhino,1 point,Thu May 14 06:43:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, one big issue that was shown in MSI was the investment in the top lane as being one of the most important pieces of victory.  TSM's game (at least for now) is usually let Dyrus fall behind but he'll come back later because he's such a consistent player. A big issue arises when the game for most of the MSI teams as being, invest in our top lane and keep them even/ahead."
TeamSolomid,35x0bj,Knightsavior,1 point,Thu May 14 09:53:58 2015 UTC,"According to Dyrus, it's not so much that TSM leaves him alone. Rather, he doesn't call for help as effectively as he should.

TeamSolomid,35qkid,howielyun1,2,Tue May 12 20:12:23 2015 UTC,yeah but thats something dyrus said for a long time.  I think it may be good that they saw now how top teams will exploit it because it seems like noone in NA was able to do it. Just learn from it and it'll be fine
TeamSolomid,35qkid,Cr4ck41,3,Wed May 13 07:59:02 2015 UTC,What would be better is if the NA teams take that blueprint and expose TSM in the LCS also. That would force TSM to adapt at home and would make the top teams around the world have to figure out a different method.

TeamSolomid,35qkid,Montaron87,1 point,Tue May 12 23:03:37 2015 UTC,"I don't think MSI was just a case of top tier teams showing up and TSM being worse than them, it's the meta in it's entirety that was in part to blame.  Lots of skirmishing and small fights everywhere, jungle ganks and pressure all over the map was basically the way to go at MSI. TSM doesn't play that and the style that TSM does play apparently gets countered very hard by this.  It's also a consequence of the regional play. In NA, everyone is aiming to beat the top dogs, C9 and TSM, by beating them at their own game. So they don't really encounter this chaotic and high pressure playstyle. Rush and Impact come closest to that and he played Nunu for three games during the playoffs instead of picking a ganking and teamfighting champ.  TSM needs to adapt and broaden their playstyle. They don't have to go all in on the same high-pressure style, because they might just get left behind again when the meta switches, but something has to change."
