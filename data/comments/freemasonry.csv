As in since we met in taverns, they would break for ""refreshment"" either down below in out of the private room and they were in turn babysat by the JW to make sure they didn't blab anything or get too ""happy"".  My real paper has history of tavern life and it's role circa that time (hot meal, hot place, beer/booze, women, social, gossip, news, etc)  BUT if there is something that says I'm wrong, I'd like to find that (or support it)."

Somebody once told me that the next door property owner had some beef with the lodge and wouldn't sell a right-of-way or allow them to use the property, which is why those stairs were built.

freemasonry,3e4j7n,ChuckEye,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:18:14 2015 UTC,"In the long history of the craft, nothing has caused as much controversy and commotion as the organization’s commitment to secrecy. This one thing has generated rumors so fanciful that they have become myths. It has produced suspicion and satire, mistrust and ridicule. And it supports a mystique that has both helped and hurt the organization in ways that can only be guessed. Unfortunately, this mystique is not entirely benign. While the members enjoy their fellowship, the public is left to imagine what goes on behind the closed doors of the lodge. Imagination is a powerful tool, and through it the very features that make Freemasonry attractive to its members give rise to a great variety of fantastic images. Some who view Freemasonry from the outside believe that it is a sinister clique.  In their minds, the lodge is a place where tonight’s clandestine Whispers become tomorrow’s government policy and where men gain power by knowing the secret word, not by winning popular elections. This view is not hard to understand. The mere fact that a thing is hidden spurs curiosity. And an organization that actually flaunts its secrecy will certainly conjure up images of conspiracy and forbidden activities. Anyone who doubts that the Masons flaunt their secrecy needs to go no farther than the popular press. Newspapers and magazines carry the occasional photo of Freemasons posing in their embroidered aprons and white gloves. Chains of office hang heavily on their breasts, and some wear funny hats. But the captions never explain the accouterments."

New Series Vol 37 Pt 1, on page 21. AA 321359. god, that sucked.  this means that the copyright must have been actively renewed in the late 1950s; if it was not renewed, then it has fallen into the public domain. i searched renewal records, transcribed by gutenberg and also the image search via google books, for 1956, 1957, 1958, and 1959, and didn't find it. i did see other stuff published by the MSANA that got renewed, but not this map.  if the copyright, indeed, was not renewed, then this map is in the public domain.  yet more digging indicates that the copyright registration may have referred to a book of which the map was part. but even if that's true, it doesn't look like the registration was renewed.  also, a copy of the book is apparently held by the University of Utah's J.

However, I'll give it a shot:  When Freemasonry was developing, the classical views of architecture were undergoing revival. By the time the Preston-Webb lectures were written, neo-classicism was very much in vogue. So, despite our genesis as medieval workmen, working in the Gothic style, we are taught the more au courant style.   Stephenson in his book The Scottish Century mentions Vitruvius and his De Architectura as a particular influence on Masonic philosophy.

The entered apprentice, fellow craft and mark degrees have clear evidence in the historical record of the operative lodges in what is now England and Scotland. No Kabbalah, except what may have been superimposed upon it after the mid-to-late 1720s.  So the question becomes then what of our high-grade rituals then, which in many cases we clearly know the answer is both, depending the rituals you are discussing. Henrik Bogdan has a nice paper on the Master Mason degree (spoiler alert - Words are used). Ecossais based traditions also incorporated Kabbalistic ideas into their rituals."

And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make even one hair white or black. All you need to say is simply ‘Yes’ or ‘No’; anything beyond this comes from the evil one."" (Matthew 5:33-37)"

freemasonry,3e1jlj,millennialfreemason,2,Tue Jul 21 13:56:32 2015 UTC,Is it heavier than a feather?
freemasonry,3e1jlj,bmkecck,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:41:17 2015 UTC,"Okay, it's been 23 years since my last Theology class, what was the context for Christ prohibiting oaths? Was it the idea of that because you, as a mortal, don't have the power or will, so that oaths have no force and effect? That because you are submissive to God's will, any oath you make is an affront to God's will? Yeah, I may need to go back and read my Aquinas."
freemasonry,3e1jlj,millennialfreemason,2,Tue Jul 21 13:56:04 2015 UTC,"At least in my uneducated reading, this passage is found in his Sermon on the Mount under his Antithesis, where Jesus explains the six? aspects of the law and how discipleship requires more than what is just required. So, to avoid murdering someone, do not be angry with your brother, to avoid swearing falsely, never take an oath, avoid adultery, tear out your eyes, and to love your neighbor, live by the Golden Rule. My thought has always been that this is related to discipleship, that just satisfying the law is not enough."
freemasonry,3e1jlj,aaronsherman,4,Tue Jul 21 14:40:37 2015 UTC,"It's also in a string of statements that are clearly an unequivocally metaphorical hyperbole. He never suggested that anyone actually cut out their eyes, but rather that that would be preferable to committing adultery. So, a good Christian, IMHO, would not become a Freemason unless they were intent on keeping any oath they took. I find this to be a positive view of Freemasonry. I'd much rather have a Brother who takes his oath that seriously than one who says whatever is necessary to become a Mason."
freemasonry,3e1jlj,erbaker,3,Tue Jul 21 19:04:49 2015 UTC,"That was my interpretation of the verse as well. That you shouldn't take an oath without sincerity, and breaking an oath that you took in God's name is taking his name in vain."
freemasonry,3e1jlj,millennialfreemason,3,Tue Jul 21 20:05:25 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I think we're saying the same thing. As you are pointing out, Jesus is employing the rhetorical device of hyperbole. Discipleship implies doing more than just the simple things. It's taking seriously the commandments. It's taking seriously actions. You can take an oath but it would be unnecessary for a disciple because the thought of bearing false witness is just that unthinkable.   But maybe I've been reading too much Bonhoeffer lately."
freemasonry,3e1jlj,aaronsherman,4,Tue Jul 21 20:12:55 2015 UTC,"But the oaths would still be necessary in Freemasonry, even if everyone were that trustworthy. The oath isn't just there to ensure that the candidate complies with the rules, but to communicate to the candidate the essential values of the institution.  I often find myself referring back to my obligations in conversation for just this reason.  I'm sure you realized this, but I thought it worth saying to be clear."
freemasonry,3e1jlj,millennialfreemason,2,Tue Jul 21 21:16:24 2015 UTC,Excellent point.
freemasonry,3e1jlj,HiImFarab,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:21:34 2015 UTC,"The other person is correct. Im obviously not a perfect example of a Christian if you look at my post history but I do take my religion pretty seriously nontheless.  Its the book of matthew. "" 34 But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God's throne:  35 Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King.  36 Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black.  37 But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.""  So by this, it would be perfectly acceptable for me to say ""I will not divulge anything I learn here"". However, actually swearing and taking a solemn oath, not possible. The initiation ritual is not a secret aspect of freemasonry at all so I'm sure everyone here knows that it would be unreasonable to expect to be accepted without performing the customary oath.  This also applies to military service, or even oaths requested in a legal proceeding. I take that particular teaching to heart and there are no circumstances where I could make an exception."

freemasonry,3e1jlj,DerpingtonEsquire,2,Tue Jul 21 18:08:02 2015 UTC,"As I said above, I think that unless you're intent on gouging out your own eyes to prevent adultery, you're taking hyperbole too far. But that's your call, and I respect it. As far as the legends used as allegory in Freemasonry, I think it's only useful in that context, but you can certainly read Mackey or Wilmshurst to get a sense of what they thought it all meant and how it fit in (note that no one Mason's interpretation is considered ""correct')."

I can say that all lives matter and people will consider that a filthy racist statement. When it gets to the point where you can't even say that life matters then it's safe to assume that society has jumped the shark.  Even saying homosexuality is a sin is considered filthy and foolish talk these days. It's probably considered hate speech by many.

freemasonry,3e1jlj,d565,2,Tue Jul 21 17:56:49 2015 UTC,"Ha ha, understandable. Truth be told, the Christian church these days is steeped in hypocrisy, thats pretty much blatantly obvious to everyone and it's also true that God does not like hypocrisy. Many of the people in Church who shame others for using cuss words generally do it in their private life themselves.  They do it to please other people and to look good socially, not that they don't do it themselves or have any moral qualms about it. I just try to be myself around everyone. I believe worshipping in spirit and in truth is the correct way to do so, and it's not possible to do that if your living in hypocrisy IMO.  God sees it all. It's his judgement I have to concern myself with, not catering to the expectations of men. Thats just my personal philosophy on the whole thing."
freemasonry,3e1jlj,fitzgeraldb,2,Tue Jul 21 18:03:05 2015 UTC,"So this oath thing, how specific does it get? Can you get into legally binding contacts, exchange marriage vows, or join the military?  Edit: Just saw a previous post of yours. Very fascinating."
freemasonry,3e1jlj,BrotherM,2,Tue Jul 21 18:09:46 2015 UTC,"You didn't come here for a lecture, but an honest looking for information and before various and sundry people start jumping up and down on you:   It would be good for everyone to remember that, in America, the First Amendment guarantees you the right to freedom of expression, but not freedom from consequences. So, people are free to say whatever they darn well please, as long as they are willing to handle the consequences, which can range from legal prosecution for inciting a riot to social judgement for using verbiage that is outside what is socially accepted.  In linguistics, there is something called the Worf-Sapir hypothesis which, in general terms, says that language determines thought and culture determines context. Humans tend to understand their world verbally and in order for us to understand our world, we need to ""name"" it, or be able to put words to the concept or object. Therefore the words that people use are powerful because they can help determine the way that others think. Describing someone to your friend as a lady, a mother, a whore, a chica, a skirt, etc automatically colors what your friend thinks about that person you're describing. It may also color what your friend thinks about you. Culture determines context: as a society, we culturally agree that certain words have certain meanings. That society can be large, like all English -speaking nations, or it can be small, like those who watch Firefly (Shiny!!), but the particular culture you are in determines the connotations associated with each word and it's appropriateness. So, you saying that ""no fucks will be given about fraternal secrets"" is fine to say, it is your right to say it, and God Bless America that you can say it. But American culture has also determined that there is a time and place for using that word, and surely you understand that. You wouldn't use words like that in church and you wouldn't usually use those words in polite and respectful discourse.    It is absolutely your right to use whatever words you so choose, but understand that people are always going to judge you on the words that you use.   Best wishes on your search for more Light."
freemasonry,3e1jlj,BrotherM,2,Tue Jul 21 18:11:17 2015 UTC,"You certainly have a good point. There is a line here somewhere that I'm sure I don't walk perfectly.  American culture has determined that there are a lot of things should not be said to the point of sheer ridiculouslness these days so I don't allow the cultute to entirely dictate where the line is.  I do believe I have fair judgement on the issue, but not perfect judgement. I'm obvioulsy not going to use those particular words with elderly ladies at the grocery store, police officers, or get up on an alter anywhere and scream it out. Thats legitimate respect. I don't see a need to do so in casual conversation though. Perhaps I'm wrong at some level but I don't perceive it to be a filthy conversation."

To me, the greater benefit of practicing mouth-to-ear rote memorization is in the relationships built between teacher and student - spend some time, get to know the guys in your lodge, ask lots of questions, and find your own meaning.   The beautiful thing about symbolic teachings is different individuals can have fiercely different individual interpretations, and that's ok."

Now, that being said (because it was my experience) I have seen a real lack in the proficiency requirement. Some lodges in our area really just want those warm bodies to fill the seats and just rush people through. What some are failing to notice is that those Brothers are completely inactive and never attend. Its a sad thing.   I was sitting next to a Brother who was raised along with me (he was from another lodge), and at our first meeting as MMs had a Q&A Pamphlet for the EA degree and asked me what it was and how to read it!"

My instructor expects and accepts nothing less than word perfect. Most of the PMs feel the same way. Our WM does not expect such proficiency.   Hearsay as it is, the standard for the WM is as good as each candidate can be. It seems that this standard has gone from being applied to the very old, to any brother returning proficiency. My coach would not have accepted 90%.   We return the long form in Lodge. The only time there is anything short of that is when multiple brothers are being examined. In such a situation, each brother returns one response, but all brothers must return the obligation in full. Proficiency is returned on the night of the next emergent communication, with exceptions. For example, I returned my EA during a stated because I had a trial scheduled and they didn't want my examination to interfere with my trial prep."

The preferred method is long form catechism. Either way, it's always given in open lodge. The MM proficiency must be given before any office or any other order can be taken and must be done within six months. The candidate is given a cipher book, but must do the proficiency from memory. The instructor can and should use the cipher.  Some prompts are to be expected, but I've seen a proficiency rejected only once, and it wasn't in my lodge. The instructors have been good in not bringing unprepared candidates. If a man is willing to go through the proficiency, it stands to reason he wants to do it to the best of his ability. It's our duty as instructors to bring out that best."

The lectures are the basic grounding that the young brother will receive, and it is so much easier to teach it right than it will be to get the ""bad words"" out later on down the road.    To pass proficiency, a candidate does not have to be word-perfect, but he must be able to answer ""a significant number of the questions"" without prompting in order to pass.   The candidate may turn in by reciting in open lodge (preferred) or before a committee appointed by the master.  I have seen my predecessor drag a few candidates by the ears before a committee, but then he didn't have a certification to protect...   I will not send a brother out to test before he's ready, and has the work pretty much down.  Now, I have one fellow, at his current rate of progress, who's going to be an EA for a long long time.    Our local practice is that you don't receive your monitor (we have no ciphers) until you have turned in your MM proficiency.    Our EA is 55 questions, the FC is 39, and the MM, 43...  plus a demonstration of the modes of recognition.

freemasonry,3dxuyf,g0lem,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:02:14 2015 UTC,How is anything different... Well the author attempts to collect more money.
freemasonry,3dxuyf,g0lem,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:39:05 2015 UTC,"I meant ""how is our knowledge improved supposing that statement were true?"" or ""what significant inference does this assumption allow?"", rather than ""why would anybody make such wild claims?"". I'm not concerned here with the ethics of the author since I have no information on him or his work."
freemasonry,3dxuyf,g0lem,3,Mon Jul 20 22:07:00 2015 UTC,"With statements like this (the original, not yours), it is difficult for me to separate the ethics of the author, and their conclusions.  Is there a benefit, if only the benefit of mental exercise, in viewing Masonry through the prism of Alchemical work, methods, symbols, etc...? Absolutely, if the author and the reader are both sufficiently educated on the matter. These experiments may result in meaningful theoretical inferences, ideas, and conclusions; and when properly communicated as such may allow another to join the author on the journey and replicate the efforts and share in knowledge.  Rarely do we see such language in Masonic discourse. Especially purchased discourse. The language is conclusive, and when coupled with the monetary remuneration given the author for their incorrect statements, ethics absolutely becomes a problem - for me anyway.    As a metaphor for change, the idea of the apron as described anonymous author to de Hoyos, and elsewhere similarly by Wilmhurst, might be compelling for some. But I don't know that the exercise proves out any alchemical influences in the Craft, nor does it add to or further illuminate upon any of the specifically Masonic symbols describing such a transformation (meaning the exercise and the conclusion is irrelevant if not superfluous), and this actually harms the Craft and the spiritual efforts thereof by adding detritus and debris to the matter.  Indeed, why? Why do tolerate, promote, and literally buy these statements? What benefit to the Craft is there? I see none. But I do so many profiting by it."

Simply saying ""x shows y because I think so"" when it obviously does not is 100% unmitigated and unsubstantiated bullshit"
freemasonry,3dxuyf,jwheetree,4,Mon Jul 20 18:12:11 2015 UTC,"While you are correct, I feel that it is comparing apples to oranges.    The lessons of the Bible are self contained truths that are true regardless of the story attached to them.  It doesn't matter if Cain and Abel were real people, the lesson ""don't be jealous of your brother"" and the many other lessons contained within their story is universal.  That lesson stands on its own two feet.  And that lesson has nothing to do with later lessons of Joseph being sold into Egypt, Jonah and the Whale, etc.  The author of said book, however, made a truth claim that enlightenment era alchemist planted a symbol in masonry and that this symbol is the square apron, completing disregarding that square aprons did not become standard until the mid-19th century.  I have every right to assume that the remainder of this book and author's work maintains that level of spurious research.  And just to be clear, I am actually a huge fan of Masonic Romanticism and believe that we throw that baby out too much for the sake of Masonic ""Authenticism.""  However, romantic scholarship in no way trumps authentic scholarship.  In this case, history proves that square aprons are a relatively modern format for the apron.  To suggest that the square apron has some historical/mystical precedent without the caveat that it is speculation and that history doesn't support that thought does not make you a romantic scholar, it makes you a masonic huckster, selling snake oil and such."

Many providers package ""reseller"" hosting packages, which give independent users separate Cpanel, FTP, and web space without the overhead of actually operating a server and securing it effectively.  I host about 50 completely separate sites on a reseller package as a side business. My main role is content and web design for them, but we offer low cost hosting as a value add for our customers, and it has proven very affordable and effective. The maintenance of a server wouldn't be a deal breaker for me (SysAdmin is my day job), but the service has been great on the reseller package and it is much cheaper than a Colo.

It ended up a political football, during which time all lodge ended up with a common template that was nearly impossible to change. On the plus side, all the lodge calendars tied into the main GL calendar, so it because easy to find out where a degree was being held. On the down side, that was only as good as the people updating, so...  They are changing that over to give lodge who want to participate a Wordpress based site. Not sure how the calendar thing is going to work, but it's already sketchy now, so it can't be any worse.   I'd say that for single lodges that want a site, I'd say just buy the domain for $15, and map it to a free Wordpress.com site. The worse thing is that there might be an ad on your front page."

freemasonry,3dux3m,The_Past_Master,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:13:04 2015 UTC,"I wanted to join an affinity Lodge located where I went to grad school (George Washington University), but paying $112 a year to a Lodge I'll never go to for a cool pin that hangs on my wall just didn't seem cost-effective."
freemasonry,3du26w,Big_Orange_Cat,10,Sun Jul 19 13:51:19 2015 UTC,"You have a gavel use, use it."
freemasonry,3du26w,Wellpaidrichguy,10,Sun Jul 19 17:38:57 2015 UTC,What anybody thinks of you is none of your business. Don't ask for volunteers. Do ask Brothers individually if they'd help work on a project.

freemasonry,3du26w,elginkevin,6,Sun Jul 19 18:08:14 2015 UTC,"I just finished my year - very challenging, very fulfilling. It's hard to give just one piece of advice. Here's what I found.     If a brother should challenge you by claiming some action or another is prohibited by the Grand Lodge constitution of your jurisdiction, they're usually full of crap and have never read the constitution. Very few of the brethren have actually read the constitution - so don't take anyone seriously in that regard until you look it up yourself. If you're about to suspend people for non-payment of dues, make damn sure you personally try to contact and speak to the brothers by phone or in person before you bring that gavel down — don't trust others who say they've exhausted all means of trying to contact them. Call them yourself and listen to what they have to say.  Should a sketchy applicant emerge, do your best to keep it from coming to a ballot. Put the names of the investigating committee members in the summons so brothers can let their objections be known before they have to drop a black ball. Make funerals ceremonies and benevolence a top priority."
freemasonry,3du26w,UnspeakableFilth,3,Sun Jul 19 17:54:21 2015 UTC,1:  I ask people which section they are referring to.  3:  some jurisdictions require a ballot one a petition is submitted.

freemasonry,3du26w,UnspeakableFilth,3,Mon Jul 20 20:22:07 2015 UTC,Visit other lodges as often as practical. The support you give to other WMs will pay off in unexpected ways.
freemasonry,3du26w,VitruvianDude,3,Sun Jul 19 15:12:35 2015 UTC,"Excellent points made already.   Try to keep things on track at business meetings. Groups of men have a habit of getting side tracked.  Resolve conflicts as quickly as possible. Do not let them escalate into heated agurements.  Practice. We have weekly fellowship meetings where we practice degree work and lectures.   Food. Food can be your best friend. We are alot more agreeable on full stomachs. Have a snack at business meetings and a meal at degrees. It can go a long way.  Your secretary will be your best friend and right hand.  As state, the buck stops with you. Yes the lodge for the most part runs itself and is a democracy of voting and whatnot, but the master has final say on all matters and has the responsibility to make tough decisions. With great power comes great responsibility.   That would be some of my high lites I've picked up as a WM."
freemasonry,3du26w,dirty_luck,3,Sun Jul 19 16:35:43 2015 UTC,"I've learned a lot in my first 7 months [our terms in PA run Dec to Dec]:   Keep an eye on everybody.  If a member is acting strange, or goes missing, check in.  Brother ought to be a familial relation, not a title. Beware the men who would be kings.  If somebody's skulking around in the dark, especially if it's someone influential, chances are they disagree with your agenda and are pursuing their own. Ask questions.  You can't oversee when you're in the dark about.  Audit the lodge's financials.  Audit the minutes.  Hold committees accountable.  Make sure you can see everything that's going in inside your lodge, the same way you can see the entire workings of the lodge from your station. You will be remembered for difficult decisions and for events.  Nothing you can do to prevent that, so make the best of it. Past Masters can be your greatest resource or your biggest hurdle...a warm father figure, a dependable worker, a stubborn opponent of change, or a man who never took off his hat. District or Grand will ask things of you that can be inconvenient or a downright burden.  Bear them with a happy smile, for the other masters of your district, and your DDGM, are brothers in arms.  Take the time to build some camaraderie with them, and they'll be the best friends you can have during the year. If you ask for help, you're not going to get it.  If you ask someone to help, you're more likely. Building on #7: Identify who wants to be involved, but is too polite to ask.  They'll appreciate you for it, and work their butts off to repay that kindness...even if it's just to substitute as an officer for a night. Be careful how you deal with fixtures.  That old guy who has owned the guide role may just lose heart if he feels you're trying to replace or sideline him.  Make sure he feels honored by what you're asking, not threatened. You will have to delegate, but remember that delegation is not abdication."
freemasonry,3du26w,foxden_racing,3,Sun Jul 19 19:32:14 2015 UTC,"The biggest piece of advice I can offer is this: use your officers. I didn't do that, and I regret it. Even if it's something simple that you could do quicker, consider delegating to a junior officer. You'll be helping them become better officers, the brothers will see you as more of a leader, and having that additional set of eyes on an issue may be very helpful. However, if you're going to do that, make sure you ask for progress reports. The very few times I did delegate, I just left them alone to do it, and none of it ever got done."
freemasonry,3du26w,jmstallard,2,Mon Jul 20 13:58:30 2015 UTC,"Communication is vital. I'm a first time WM, only 3 weeks in. Once a week, a day before our meeting, I've emailed all the officers telling them what was on deck this week, alerting them to any known absences from the officer line this week, and generally giving them a playbook by which they could conduct the business of the lodge without me if they needed to. Basically so when we get to the meeting, there are enough people on the same page (the 14 officers) that anyone else who asks can quickly determine the order of business and help enact it.   We've been busy enough, with enough new candidates, that tracking everybody with the secretary has been a significant undertaking. My first week we did an EA and had two FCs turning in their work; 2nd week was our stated. Voted on 2 petitions and had first reading of two others, requiring investigation committee assignments. 3rd week, we had 3 newly raised MMs turn in their work, did an EA, and conferred the two MMs of the guys who'd turned in their FC work in week 1.   Also, make use of committees. Give them tasks; expect them to follow through on such. Hold the committee chairs accountable and have them report in stated meetings regularly so the rest of the lodge knows what's going on."

They didn't join so that they could attend 10 meetings a year that involved little more than paying the same bills, over and over again.  Make it fun :-)"

freemasonry,3du26w,jjones266,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:31:32 2015 UTC,"IT DOESN'T MATTER IF THAT'S NOT HOW WE DID IT IN THE PAST.   Use the gavel judiciously and frequently. If there's a question about if you should do it, then you should and then ask for clarification. If something isn't right (like the altar isn't set up properly and you just noticed) hammer down and get the senior deacon to fix it.   You dont have to entertain a motion. If someone wants to close a discussion and you don't think everything's been discussed yet then you don't have to entertain it.  Likewise if someone stands up and says the same thing 10 different ways you can gavel them down (usually make sure they don't have anything else to add first, but they don't need to repeat themselves, we got it the first 3 times)  Past masters are great resources, but don't let them take over your lodge. Some are just like any other brother but with the experience of sitting in the east. Others want all the authority of the east, but none of the responsibility and will try to manipulate you.   talk to your grand lodge about what exactly are the rights of the master. In some jurisdiction the master is immune from virtually all masonic charges, and you can get dispensation from the Grand Lodge for just about anything.  If you have exceedingly long business meetings cut out all the crap. If I'm master again I'm going to skip over introductions of any non-sitting dignitary (we know who you are, you were here last month and we got a whole year of preaching to let us know who you are) and any ""good of the order"" needs to be submitted to the secretary in advance. It really slows the meeting down when 5 guys all stand up and pat each other on the back for each visiting another lodge, or meeting a candiddate, or washing a dish and the necessary round of applause that follows."

Then why bother posting here, asking if you are ""off your rocker"" when you've already made your mind up?   You didn't come here looking to educate yourself, you came looking to verify your misguided presumptions and to find reasons to justify your stance.   In fact, everything about both your initial post and your responses to the replies of others suggests something about your character--that you are quick to judge others while demanding that you not be judged, and when confronted with information that does support the notion that you are, in fact, ""off your rocker,"" you dismiss it with a ""I already know what I need to"" attitude.   Freemasonry is a social circle and organization for like minded men. Plain and simple. Which fundamentally makes it no different that your peer groups/social circle. ""Oh, but it's a boy's club! So it's different!"" Not really. Because within your peer group/social circle, you and the others in it make judgements on who to let in and who to exclude. You may not make a gender based distinction, but there will be something. No group is fully open to anyone and everyone; if nothing else, you will be inclusive or exclusive simply based on personality traits. And that is judgement. Except, in your case, you've displayed quite clearly that you're much more judgmental than we as an organization are.   I suspect that the issue really isn't Freemasonry, it's ego. Your ego. You're upset that a member of your social group has a thing that he enjoys and is passionate about, and that it has attracted the attention--and the focus--of the other members of your social group... meaning you're suddenly not as important as you want to be. You're making it sexist, not him, not Freemasonry, and you're doing it as a means to justify your own bruised ego. There's nothing wrong with men bonding. There's nothing wrong with women bonding (I'd guess that you're the kind of person who will stand up and shout loudest about how important it is that women have their 'safe' places while shouting down anyone suggesting that men need/deserve them too).   Maybe you should be less worried about what you -think- you know, and when you ask someone for correction, try having an open enough mind to listen to them. And then do some evaluation of yourself, and what really bothers you about the situation. Since clearly the issue isn't Freemasonry, or even gender issues.  You don't want Freemasonry in your life. That is your right to decide. But you do not get to decide for others what they can and can't have in their lives. If the problem is that others are accepting it, and you can't deal with it, then you're the one that needs to decide to remain in the social group or to find another one more suitable to your wants and needs."

There are undeniably and sadly cases of corruption involving Masons, but such practices are completely unacceptable to the wider fraternity, and the accusation can be levelled at pretty much any given group - you're not complaining on /r/military about veterans employing veterans, are you?  As for sexism; freemasonry is not a sexist organisation, but instead promotes equality and love towards and for everyone. I will admit that I personally wish it wasn't the case that regular freemasonry is purely male, but it does not necessarily follow that it is sexist in its inception."

I admit, that when you're just learning about Freemasonry and from the outside looking in, it might be a little confusing. However, there is nothing in the fraternity that's anti-women or anti-poor.   Now, any organization will have members that don't live up. However, Freemasonry in it's self isn't running around saying women or less or that men are better or anything of the kind. Being male only is not evidence of this.   Not something I asked for to invade my space.   People are allowed to have hobbies and belong to groups you don't like. You don't get to dictate your friends activities because they make you feel weird.   Also, if he's excited to meet another Mason I don't see how that's a bad thing. I can't even see how that can be interpreted as a negative."
freemasonry,3dtn1m,BrotherWigg,6,Tue Jul 21 10:03:36 2015 UTC,"Miss I've read your post, the replies of the other brothers, and your comments and I'd like to add my two cents.  First off brothers try not to be offended or offensive but let's try to handle this as we would in person instead of like an anonymous internet troll.  ""I'm a woman and never had an interest in freemasonry, especially when I learned about its sexist policies and beliefs""  We're just a male fraternity as the others have said no more sexist than gender itself .  We are first and foremost a male fraternity.  I personally joined because I had so few real friends I could trust and feel connect with.  "" I definitely dont want freemasonry in my life."" That's very fine   ""Anyways, someone in my social group who I otherwise respect highly is a free mason and gets quite excited when he has the chance to meet another mason.""  We're brothers.  When we see each other even if we've never met before there are ties that bind and it causes a warm fuzzy feeling.    If you respect this man in all other aspects that should be how you judge and think of him.  ""My impression from the masons I know is that nepotism is a big benefit to being a freemason(not just social but professionally, which really just compounds the odiousness of it)""  As far as nepotism goes Masons are generally too practical for the type of nepotism you're thinking of.  If a mason and and a non-mason apply for the same job and a mason is in charge of hiring, the more qualified person will get the job.  We won't ruin our own livelihood for each other that would be stupid. I however work in the hospitality sector and by working in the kitchen and helping cook our monthly dinners a few older brothers have helped me get a better job because now I have some experience.  I can think of a few instances of things like that happening at lodge.  It seems almost like something one would do for their family, doesn't it?  "" and he's starting to bring freemason into our social group and talking about it a lot more.""  You mean he's hanging out with his new friends and talking about something they have in common?  When I was first raised it was all I could talk about too.  The same is true for when I was a kid and the power rangers first came out.  ""I understand masons are supposed to support other masons and considering I will never be a part of that, I am filled with dread at the prospect of eventually being excluded from things, also due to the gender segregarion beliefs of masons.""  Masons help everyone.  http://www.masonicinfo.com/shrinehosp.htm Feel free to do some of your own googleing if you don't believe me But if I found myself homeless I would indeed look to my brothers for help I expect that they would oblige;)  Aside from going to the actual lodge meetings you're not excluded from much.  In most districts you can go to dinner at the lodge and and even explore the temple as long as lodge isn't in session.  As far as gender segregation goes I'll just agree.  We're a male organization and not ashamed of the fact.  Woman can be involved in aspects of masonry and indeed they often are but yes we are a mens' organization.  ""I dont want to be dramatic irl so im asking the internet first. Am I off my rocker or is my dread well founded?""  Yeah... A little bit, but we all fear what we don't know and I appreciate that you came here to ask.  If you have any other questions pm me or ask here just bear in mind we do love masonry and are quick to defend it especially if you attack it viciously."

Let's see if we can find the reasons why you dislike this person. Is it because he belongs to an organization? Is it because he is not of felonious character? is it because he believes in a higher power?   it seems he is well liked in your social circle, maybe you should actually get to know this ""seemingly"" upstanding man.

We have ways of recognizing each other like rings and emblems but iv never just started talking about masonry in social or professional settings unless its brought up or I was asked. This brother is most likely still excited over the novelty of being a mason and just likes to gloat a little. Masons do support each other but only when its directly requested. If I were interviewing someone who was also a Mason and they told me they were one hoping to gain favoritism I'd find it very distasteful and unmasonic. I'm sorry you feel our fraternity is sexist. Old traditions die hard and freemasonry has been this way for hundreds of years. but we also have sister organizations like The order of the eastern star which females are able to join.

No.   Freemasonry is about as sexist as a women's golf outing.   There is no reason for you to want to be there.  It's not for you.   Life doesn't revolve around you and what you want.  Suddenly men are not allowed to gather with like minded men for fear of being labeled sexist.    Honestly, could you BE more judgemental?"

And also I have to say this every time its mentioned, we are not a secret society. We have a few things we keep private just like any social club or college fraternity. And you can think masonry is wrong all you want but the fact is you are hating on an organization who donates millions to charities each year, volunteers endless hours on community service and focuses on making good men better.

However, there have been many split offs over the years, so your Grandfather may not have been a member of what many would consider ""regular"" Masonry.

All three held the position of PGM for the GL of Colorado, and my great-great-grandfather, Marshall Van Fleet also headed the other three Grand York Rite bodies, the Grand Chapter of Royal Arch Masons, the Grand Council of Royal and Select Masters, and the Grand Commandery of Knights Templar. His son, Glenn Van Fleet (The owner of the setting maul) was  Most Excellent Grand High Priest of the Most Excellent Grand Chapter of Royal Arch Masons of Colorado, at the time of Colorado's centennial celebration.  Glenn had three daughters, they didn't end up marrying Masons, although my grandmother said she did Job's Daughters as a girl, but didn't stick with it. So neither my dad nor any grandparents were Masons, but somehow I ended up carrying it on. It was really touching to receive these gifts last night and I'll carry them with me through my life.   The only one she couldn't explain was the silver plate from the GL of Kansas, dated 1958. One of the guys must have visited as GM and been given that, but that's speculation."

freemasonry,3dmdtr,millennialfreemason,2,Fri Jul 17 14:17:07 2015 UTC,I am not familiar with holiday rankings. One would say that Easter (the actual resurrection of Jesus Christ) is more important than the birth of the Savior.  But that's just me.  There are 2 other Muslim festivals that are celebrated: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mawlid https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eid_al-Adha  Rank them as you see fit.
freemasonry,3dmdtr,753i,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:14:00 2015 UTC,"Personally, I rank Maundy Thursday at the top, but I'm strange like that. Trying to make comparisons across cultures is tricky.  Even with a full explanation, without understanding the background culture it doesn't have full impact. This is one of the things about Masonry that amazes me:  How it exists and is effective even in non-Judeo Christian cultures.  The rituals are powerful enough in their symbology to cross cultural boundaries and teach their lessons universally where other methods of communicating ideas fail."
freemasonry,3dmdtr,jwheetree,2,Fri Jul 17 20:55:27 2015 UTC,This make sense in my head but not out load maybe.  Kinda what I was thinking is how you know Christmas is celebrated by non religious background but Easter is much more celebrated by only people who are religious.  In heavy Muslim areas does everything shut down for observance or more like Easter where the Walmart is open.   I know I sound ignorant.  However that might be because I am.

freemasonry,3dmfx0,TheStarkReality,3,Sat Jul 18 05:54:13 2015 UTC,"I've made this argument before with respect to judges, but I think the point is the same if not quite as strong...  When you become a politician there are dozens of ties to friends, family, culture, region, school, etc. which you are supposed to set aside for the greater good of your constituency. Now, some politicians are good at this, and I would argue that most are not. But if you're going to attack the fact that many are not, Freemasonry is not the place.  What Freemasonry is is a soft target. We're not a religion or an ethnicity or any of the other categories that would worry people, so it's safe to go after us... first. Of course, that will never be enough.  If a politician doesn't want to tell you that he's a Mason, then why should he? That's his personal business and if you feel he can't be trusted to keep his social ties out of his office, then Freemasonry is, I assure you, going to be the last of your worries."

The annual service in the U.S. is Anglican in form, though no Communion.  Usually in a cathedral, which is pleasant.  Members of the Order may process if they wish.  It is co-ed, of course.  The induction and promotion portions are quite basic, with the exception of the knights and dames. The name is read.  The gong hung on the clip, and off you go.  There are various fund raising events around the U.S.  I think the annual dinner is about $300.00 for the lowest amount.  There is travel and hotel as well.    There are a number of Masons who are members in the U.S. , largely in PA.    If one achieves Knight or Dame, which is rare, one still doesn't use the honorific Sir or Lady.

freemasonry,3dift3,ryanmercer,2,Fri Jul 17 11:22:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this is the worst time of the year for help from GL. I'm 90% sure it's in the GL blue laws that lodges go dark in July and August.  Regarding Grand Lodge Insurance: S.R. 54.140. State-Wide Group Insurance. Provisions for workers compensation, fidelity bonding, money and securities, paraphernalia, premises medical payments and excess comprehensive public liability for each Lodge shall be made in the Grand Lodge insurance program. An explanation of the scope of the protection provided will be supplied to the Secretary of each Lodge and will be revised and distributed as necessary. Each Lodge will be billed annually for its share of the premium cost, based on Lodge membership at the close of the calendar year immediately preceding, which shall be due on or before the fifteenth day of March.  In S.R. 55.180, it talks about monthly reports, and mentions that they're required by the 10th day of every month, July and August excepted. That's as close to an official statement as i can find  If this calendar is to be trusted, I was totally wrong on the going dark law."
freemasonry,3dift3,coldcraft,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:27:21 2015 UTC,"My Lodge doesn't go dark at all, ever. But, I'm fairly certain the GL does, I know the SR Valley does for sure."
freemasonry,3dift3,ryanmercer,6,Fri Jul 17 14:37:08 2015 UTC,"For anyone else wondering:  I've called the WM of the lodge and verified what happened, then made a donation on gofund me and posted it to a bunch of places on FB.  $5 or $10 won't mean anything to us, but it will for them.   Another words: Our turn to give back a small percentage of what's been given to us."

freemasonry,3dift3,swimbikerunrun,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:59:47 2015 UTC,Not particularly. I have some thoughts why I think bitocin won't last although I did try to encourage it's adoption with a small business I no longer run.
freemasonry,3dift3,ryanmercer,2,Fri Jul 17 12:05:57 2015 UTC,"well, pm me your deposit address. I would like to pay for you to see Antman this weekend, sir. Nobody should have to wait a week to see Antman!"

With it looking like the high is 90F tomorrow I imagine I'll be cutting tree in 30 minute bursts all weekend which will keep me busy anyway. Thanks though :)

freemasonry,3dift3,chrisrahm,3,Fri Jul 17 01:36:11 2015 UTC,I shared this and my lovely mother donated to the cause!
freemasonry,3dift3,QuarryFresh,2,Thu Jul 16 20:49:27 2015 UTC,Tell your mom we said thanks! :-P
freemasonry,3dift3,swimbikerunrun,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:59:34 2015 UTC,Will do!
freemasonry,3dift3,QuarryFresh,2,Thu Jul 16 21:29:19 2015 UTC,Thank you quarryfrest and thank your lovely mother as well.  Everyone at #491 is excited about the amount of support we have been receiving.
freemasonry,3dift3,chrisrahm,2,Fri Jul 17 01:37:53 2015 UTC,I wonder why their insurance isn't covering it.
freemasonry,3dift3,ryanmercer,2,Thu Jul 16 15:29:37 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I'm not opposed to helping, but can we get specifics on the insurance and what is and isn't covered?"

freemasonry,3dift3,BrotherM,2,Thu Jul 16 16:52:07 2015 UTC,Put that in the title because not everyone would know what jurisdiction Veedersburg F. & A. M. Lodge #491 fell under or where it is even located.
freemasonry,3dift3,chrisrahm,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:06:23 2015 UTC,I was just confused.  Wasnt trying to be critical.  Peace and love bro
freemasonry,3dift3,BrotherM,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:55:55 2015 UTC,No worries! I can see where it could be confusing.
freemasonry,3dift3,ryanmercer,0,Thu Jul 16 19:52:36 2015 UTC,Wait...why did the Lodge ceiling fall?
freemasonry,3dift3,BrotherM,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:01:58 2015 UTC,It was 100+ years of aged plaster.  Just got tired is all.  :(  Thanks again everyone on this thread for your help.
freemasonry,3dift3,chrisrahm,-1,Fri Jul 17 01:28:44 2015 UTC,"You guys never looked up and thought ""Hey, that's 100 year old plaster...maybe we ought to repair/maintain it?""?"
freemasonry,3dift3,BrotherM,2,Fri Jul 17 02:33:18 2015 UTC,"I grew up in a house built in the first few years of the 1900's. My parent's bedroom one night in the middle of the night had a 3-4sqft section of plaster just fall off the ceiling in the corner. There were zero signs that it was going to happen.   Besides, not every Lodge has enough money coming in to just go ""hey let's replace the ceiling, it's only going to cost us 5-30k$"""
freemasonry,3dift3,chrisrahm,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:27:50 2015 UTC,"Besides, not every Lodge has enough money coming in to just go ""hey let's replace the ceiling, it's only going to cost us 5-30k$""   ...generally due to underpriced dues. The response for which I was looking was ""we haven't the money for that! Our dues are only $50/year!"". :-)"
freemasonry,3dj17v,bmkecck,13,Thu Jul 16 17:45:34 2015 UTC,I do not correct or advise lodges of which I am not a member of. I would not say anything if you were just visiting.  I visited a lodge last year and some things were done wrong. I sat there and bit my tongue.
freemasonry,3dj17v,BrotherSteve,2,Thu Jul 16 19:25:10 2015 UTC,"This is the answer I favour. You should always be courteous, and unless you're one of the world's most amazing orators, a single response to a toast is not going to induce drastic change. The lodge where I had my raising was frankly a shambles, but when I responded to my toast, the closest I came to criticism was to talk about how Masonry is about constantly striving for improvement.  If it seriously bothers you to see lodges that are slacking off like this, then get involved, visit frequently, try and induce change through regular effort."
freemasonry,3dj17v,TheStarkReality,5,Thu Jul 16 23:12:54 2015 UTC,"My mother Lodge is like that.  In reality, they want to die, they just don't want to acknowledge it.  I won't name it, as they don't deserve any kind of publicity with their attitude.  There is $2 million AUD in the bank, and very sizeable real estate holdings.  There are 55 members on the books, but only 20 regular attendants, and then only 10 can do work.  We have a Past Grand Master in our ranks, which attends regularly.  Their problem is geography, this lodge was the best lodge in its area, and had hundreds of members in its heyday, spawned 10 daughter lodges...and then the cultural mix of the area changed.  The area went from White Anglosaxons and Scotts to Middle Eastern and Asian in the last 30 years.  They are not outwardly racist, but they want to cherry pick their members.  I just finished a 2 year WM term there, and I am South American, white enough to pass muster.  At the moment, I have taken over as Secretary, and with the new WM we are trying to slowly bring in young members, and wait for the old guys to die out.  A few of the older lodges in Sydney have had this transformation, get enough young people to change the culture of the lodge, and you no longer have to close it.  If you can't do that, then let it die."
freemasonry,3dj17v,Temetnoscecubed,2,Thu Jul 16 19:41:56 2015 UTC,"The problem is that the culture pervades through to the new ones and they become part of the culture you are trying to wane the lodge out of. It is very important to be part of the application, initiation, education and mentoring process showing the new members how it should be done and motivating them to do better"
freemasonry,3dj17v,753i,3,Fri Jul 17 08:48:21 2015 UTC,It really is as if Willie Tyler and Lester    Eh?

freemasonry,3dj17v,jjones266,3,Thu Jul 16 18:47:36 2015 UTC,"I'd say the reasons listed in the OP are the some of the main causes for disinterest and disillusionment of new brethren, right behind politics and egos.    The thing is, this isn't an isolated incident, it's a widespread problem and it doesn't matter what programs or policies you implement to get more members in, if the problem still exists then you won't retain many people.  We gotta fix the hole in our bucket."
freemasonry,3dj17v,753i,4,Thu Jul 16 20:14:12 2015 UTC,Let them die.
freemasonry,3dj17v,erbaker,2,Thu Jul 16 18:57:09 2015 UTC,Can I get an example of a bro handshake? I have no visual
freemasonry,3dj17v,erbaker,3,Thu Jul 16 18:32:30 2015 UTC,Guys in the Lodge are slightly less ripped
freemasonry,3dj17v,scotladd,5,Thu Jul 16 18:44:04 2015 UTC,"In all seriousness, have you ever gotten a bro handshake during ritual?   That seems insane to me. If they don't know the pass grip, why are they allowed to sit in?"
freemasonry,3dj17v,TikiJack,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:31:01 2015 UTC,Exactly.
freemasonry,3dj17v,ryanmercer,2,Thu Jul 16 19:37:43 2015 UTC,"I think it starts with instructors. Those slacking, or bickering or whatever are already set in their ways. It will take a whole lot of effort to get them to do what they should be doing anyway.  But if instructors/mentors lead by installing a desire for immaculate catechism, and flawless floorwork, it instills a sense of pride in accomplishing that. Once you get two or three freshly raised MMs to hold themselves to a higher standard (because they were taught to do so) other more experienced members will fall in line or fall behind. The same instructors move on to the next set of EAs and do the same thing.   It takes time. But, if you have spent any time in lodge you know that's what we do... move slowly."
freemasonry,3dj17v,BrotherSteve,2,Fri Jul 17 00:43:23 2015 UTC,"Well, wait. Are these great guys or a bunch of lazy, disrespectful brohams? Because they can't be both, can they? The second bunch are not great guys. They're lazy, disrespectful twats. If that's the case, find whatever diamonds in the rough there are and cordially invite them to visit your lodge so they can see freemasonry as it's better intended.  If they're great guys and just lack direction, then they're not going to get offended by positive suggestions for change or offers of help. They might not take the advice, but you can still connect with them on some level. You have to be polite, helpful, non-intrusive, and committed."
