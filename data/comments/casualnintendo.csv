Mr. Iwata would wake me up in the mornings for nintendo directs, make me wait outside of the Target at 5 am for a useless plastic amiibo toy. The best times in my life are spent playing nintendo with my friends and family. So with heavy hearts as fans we let Mr. Iwata go. We will miss the great times he gave us and the dumb please understand and directly to you jokes that we love so much. Rest in Piece Satoru Iwata. The 3ds game is for scale, and the white bar along the top is made from half clear beads and glow in the dark beads, when put in the dark it shows 1959 - 2015.

I realized the exact same thing, Mr. Iwata may have been one of my friends I spent the most time with. My first gaming system was a Gameboy Color. Man I was so happy to get that and some little dinky racing game I had for it. Then I got Pokemon Red and gold (my sister always got the other pokemon game), got a nintendo 64 with Super Mario 64 and Ocarina of Time, Gamecube with Wind Waker and Zelda Collecters Edition GBA with pokemon sapphire and leafgreen, eventually I got the Wii and Twilight Princess. Obviously I have been a lifelong nintendo fan, but you never really realize how much something impacts your life. The system I probably played the most was Gamecube. I can't even count the number of hours I poured into SSBM, Mario Party 5, etc. When I didn't have my friends to play with, I could always turn to Zelda or Mario. Mr. Iwata has been a lifelong friend of mine, I just never realized it. I am extremely saddened by the loss of one of my greatest friends since childhood, and he will be severely missed. R.I.P.

casualnintendo,3d7qrz,real-dreamer,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:19:34 2015 UTC,"These photos were taken during my Tokyo trip in May of 2015, it might not be much, but this is my tribute to our beloved Mr Iwata and Nintendo.  In Hong Kong, most of the non-gamers knows about PS, XBox, and Wii, but only plenty of them have heard about N64 and GC. N64 and GC seems couldn't made their way to Hong Kong, and if it wasn't my dad, I could never have grown up enjoying the great games that Nintendo made.  Born in early 90s, N64 is my second console(The first one is PC-Engine), my Dad bought it from Japan during his working trip and it is the greatest thing that happened in my childhood. It's funny how we say Mario Kart, Mario Party, and Smash Bro titles are friendship destroyers, because if it weren't these games, I could never bond with my classmates in a greater extend. Back in the days, we always go to each other's home to play Smash Bros and Mario Kart, and even watched my friend play OoT for a whole day.  Many Nintendo's titles share similar messages. They help us build up our courage through adventures that we lacked, give us hope, teach us to explore, to dream big, and inspire the others. Yes, the greatest gifts from Nintendo are the endless inspirations that we all can't cease to be amazed from time to time. And for this, Mr Iwata and Nintendo, we can't thank you enough for giving us everything.   I am sure many of you see Link as your childhood hero, and so am I. I have never completed OoT, but I read the story in manga so I know how brave and selfless our hero and heroine are. Maybe I don't want his adventure to end and that's why I stopped playing the game? Through these photos I continued my hero's journey in my own way, and I sincerely hope the legacy of Mr Iwata, Nintendo, and all of our heroes and heroines, can pass on forever."

Growing up with the Gamecube and DS, I didn't know very much about Iwata's previous hand in game development, but he was the CEO of Nintendo during my childhood and he and all of Nintendo shaped my experience with the systems from a young age and gifted me some of my greatest childhood memories.  Playing Pokemon Diamond/ Pearl and Super Smash Bros Melee come to mind.  I am more thankful for this than you will know.  Thou I had never met you, it was very hard to eat this cake knowing you had passed away on my birthday. . .  Maybe it was because I ate it the day after, but I doubt it.  That cake, like many others I've seen was Nintendo related because we all share a passion for what you have all created, and what we all love.  I just wanted to type out what was on my mind.

Open up the System Preferences pane, you'll see a new option under Other named ""Xbox 360 Controllers."" This is where you check that the controller is working, and can set it up to your liking by inverting the axis on the analog sticks on the controller. For some games, this is all you'll need to do. Not sure but I would assume DesMume has controller support. For the times your controller isn't supported out of the box, something like Joystick Mapper or Gamepad Companion could be your salvation. Available to download via the Mac App Store, Joystick Mapper sells for $4.99 and Gamepad Companion is $7.99. Their purpose is to configure your controller to act as a keyboard and mouse, with you getting the chance to dictate which buttons map to which keyboard presses."

casualnintendo,3bet1u,xenonnsmb,-1,Sun Jun 28 16:20:33 2015 UTC,"If that's the actual price, I'm going to scream.  Nintendo is expecting us to pay $60 dollars for a standalone level editor. LittleBigPlanet has a campaign and it doesn't cost nearly as much as $60, yet it probably has a more diverse level editor than Mario Maker.  You can hack New Super Mario Bros. Wii for free and have access to the whole game's collection of sprites, backgrounds, and music, not to mention all of the music created by the SSBB hacking community. What makes Mario Maker so special? It's just an official, stripped-down, and slightly easier to use version of the Reggie level editor.  </rant>"
casualnintendo,3bet1u,TheKirbyKrasher,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:39:59 2015 UTC,Super Mario maker has 100 levels already in the game.

casualnintendo,3bet1u,AtomKick,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:22:42 2015 UTC,"The game seems to be a lot more than a simple editor. I understand your apprehensions but 100 levels is more than they've had in any NSMB game to date, plus the fact that you don't even have to edit a single level to play other peoples creations means you have access to a potential unlimited number of levels to play.  Plus the fact that there will be other features/minigames included (a recent interview confirmed the fly swatter minigame from mario paint will make a return). If you are worried about content vs. dollars spent I think that you will be pleasantly surprised. I'd say if you are worried about the price wait till it comes out and you can see a full feature list for the game, and if you still don't think its worth the money wait a couple months and you can find it used for $40-$50"

Reddit is hit or miss, but it can really pay off if you get lucky with posting in relevant subs.

Just cause you're butthurt for not having a new game with Samus     LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL  You know, in psychology that's called projection: taking your own feelings and attributing them to other people. ;-)   All you just did was prove you know jack-sh!t about me (and haven't managed to deduce anything about me from my comment either).   I don't give a crap, if Samus is in it. I am entirely convinced one can make a game that is 100% Metroid and not even have METROIDS in it. Heck, one doesn't even have to CALL the game 'Metroid'! You see: You're talking to the guy who was rooting for Star Wars -- Episode VII not to bring back ANY of the old cast. Not even the droids!   And this attitude extends to other beloved franchises just as well!   This attitude is called: not being a superficial KNOB.  :puts on shades:      a game in a different part of the Metroid universe.     Yup. The dreadful 'Zynga Galaxy'. Psh... (⌐‿⌐)"

casualnintendo,3agtt4,Sixteen_Million,0,Sun Jun 21 02:13:30 2015 UTC,"It's called 'video games'. Video games are not just about gameplay. Not even 'mostly'. If they were, then we'd mostly be content with having abstract blocks of geometry moving around in our games. Would save A LOT of resources in making the games. LOL      what does that last thing have to do with anything.     It's an example of 'new and different' not equalling GOOD that even most of the compulsively euphoric die-hard Nintendo loyalists currently in butt-hurt denial 'their company' could possibly fail them like this should understand.   Of course, there are people who'd be psyched about a 'Wii Uranus' as well. That's part of the point, basically."
casualnintendo,3agtt4,Ninclemdo,1 point,Sun Jun 21 03:05:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but you can't say a game is bad just because it isn't good looking (Most indie games), or it looks generic (Most shooters)."
casualnintendo,3agtt4,Sixteen_Million,0,Sun Jun 21 03:20:18 2015 UTC,"That's why I'm saying it looks mediocre and generic.   Entirely not like something remotely recognizable of and/or remotely worthy of the legacy that is Metroid Prime -- let alone Metroid as a whole!   So held against that legacy, it looks like crap. If, however, say, a nine-year-old presented Failure Force to me as their hobby effort, I would certainly applaud them (and suggest renaming the game LOL)!   So this is about standards and high vs. low expectations."
casualnintendo,3aj8vc,sky8949,6,Sat Jun 20 18:57:52 2015 UTC,"This petition is stupid... Even more so then the metroid prime : federation forces one... Nintendo doesn't own those characters, Square does, even when Nintendo had Geno appear in a little cameo in superstar sage they had to put a giant disclaimer at the end that it wasn't their property.    People should just face the reality, Geno and Mallow are never coming back, unless square makes another mario rpg (unlikely) Besides, this game is a fusion of paper mario and M&L It doesn't involve RPG at all"
casualnintendo,3aj8vc,henryuuk,0,Sat Jun 20 21:21:51 2015 UTC,You've got to remember though that the people who work at Alphadream are Square migrants who worked on SMRPG back in the day. They had the clout to get the original M&L:SS Geno cameo and they're the ones making Paper Jam. They even talked about putting in a Geno and Mallow cameo in a future game. It's not like it'd be impossible.

casualnintendo,3a5u68,HonProfDrEsqCPA,6,Wed Jun 17 15:15:58 2015 UTC,"I get what they are saying in this comic, however there have been some pretty universal complaints/requests and nintendo just doesn't seem to listen:   The optical drive not being a media player (GameCube wii and wiiu, and it sounds like the NX might be even more limited since it's a ""dedicated games platform"") amiibo stocking and the laissez-faire way NoA has addressed it. in game chat with friends lack of third party games lack of games older games in the virtual console lack of true expansions (sequels/prequels/alternate time lines) or any evidence of development for franchise games besides mario on wiiu: f-zero, metroid, zelda (at this point I'm not convinced they won't hold ""zelda u"" until the NX is released so fans are obligated to upgrade their system), animal crossing, the console pokemon fans have been asking about for 3 or 4 generations now. passing off crossover/reskins of existing games in an attempt to satisfy the lack of games listed above (animal crossing party) lack of flexibility and under utilization  of the gamepad. Starfox is a good example of this. Being locked into using the gamepad for targeting seems exhausting and cumbersome. I do appreciate that as an OPTION but not as the mandated mode of play. WindwakerHD seemed to do a very good job using the gamepad.   I firmly believe that nintendo does have the best interest of both their IP and fans at heart. But these are recurring complaints found on any nintendo message board. I have yet to see anyone defend nintendo against these complaints, and nintendo really hasn't addressed them."

casualnintendo,39jxjl,Ganon23000,2,Fri Jun 12 06:34:22 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure Nintendo already said that they're not going to be talking about the new Zelda at E3 this year.  Also, I would probably say I would rather see combat more akin to Wind Waker and Twilight Princess, but definitely not Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask, as those games really had lackluster combat when compared with the newer games.   The exploration you're talking about could also be likened to A Link Between Worlds, since that's the most recent game that actually lets you hit the dungeons up in no specified order.  Here's what I want out of the new game:  1: interesting, varied landscapes that give the player a sense that the world is more fleshed out.   2: caves. Lots of caves to explore. Even if there's not a cool treasure in every cave, maybe there could be clues about some previous civilization or a person that might have stayed the night there. I want little nooks and crannies to check out all over the place. Those kinds of things make the world feel more alive.  3: fully fleshed out towns and cities. Not every town has to be as complex as Majora's Mask's Clock Town, but at least as interesting as Castle Town in Twilight Princess  4: using the Gamepad for more than just a glorified map, but don't make it the entire crux of the game's control mechanics.  5: rings. Rings were such a cool feature of the Oracle games, and with Miiverse and online sharing, you could do so much with them. You could trade rings or send spare rings to other players online. This would tie in well with the tons of caves I mentioned earlier. You could leave a treasure for another player in a cave and they could find it on their game later on if they were connected to the Internet.  6: customizable outfits for Link. Different armor, tunics, boots, and other clothing that would augment his abilities or just even look cool.  7: a nice, long story with the same emotional depth of Majora's Mask or Skyward Sword.   8: no more handholding. Please don't show us a door with a chime and a click to signify that it's unlocked and then also have a helper character tell us it's unlocked and maybe we should check it out. We know this already. Please.  9: new weapons and items. I love the hook shot and boomerang, but I want to see cool new gadgets. And seeing Link use a spear instead of a sword on his horse could really liven things up.   10: some replayability. Skyward Sword had hero mode, but I think it's not enough to simply ramp up the difficulty in another play through. I think letting people hit up dungeons in whatever order they want could help with this.  Anyway, that's my top 10 list."
casualnintendo,39jxjl,jevmorgan,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:46:49 2015 UTC,It would be super cool to see all of those things in the next Zelda game! I just hope that all the fans can enjoy it for what it is :D

Either that or some of the cool logos I've seen in Mario Party 8 for different characters on the billboards and such.

casualnintendo,367wwt,gabisver,2,Sun May 17 01:09:28 2015 UTC,"A sequel is possible, but if there's a remake, it'll be of Super Mario 64.   Reasons why: Super Mario 64 sold twice as many copies, it has a twentieth anniversary next year, it would be more visibly visually upgraded from either its N64 or DS versions than Sunshine would be, and the lack of analog triggers on the GamePad and 3DS means that F.L.U.D.D's varying water pressure cannot be properly emulated on either console.  Sequel maybe. Remake? It'll be 64 or nothing."
casualnintendo,3677kn,jamesjoyce1882,5,Sat May 16 20:55:02 2015 UTC,"I know most people have no need for another handheld, but I have to say that I don't enjoy playing DS games on a 3DS (XL). The interpolation looks awful in many games (in Chrono Trigger for example, the text becomes almost unreadable). And in 1:1 mode the screen is small and the black border is irritating. DS games, especially when they use both screens in unison, were not thought out to have black border around them.  So I have been playing on a DS Lite that I got CIB mint for $30, and today I could not resist to upgrade to this beautiful model with a larger screen.  Thus if you have any interest in DS hardware or playing DS games, now is a good time to buy, the prices are probably at a historical low. Gameboy Advance SP with a backlight and Gameboy Micros are already more expensive than DS/DSi etc."

In our culture, we don't have dogs and cats living with us as semi-equals. Pokemon are more than pets and play huge role in the culture. Pokemon are there to battle, help with daily life, etc.   Based off this answer, the question about Poke-Centers can also be answered. They are funded by the Pokemon league. The Pokemon league makes a butt load of money from pokeball sales and other items. The world is full of Pokemon related items.

casualnintendo,34iuoo,kupovi,1 point,Fri May 1 15:02:16 2015 UTC,What an underrated channel. - The videos are very enjoyable and presented very well.  You have a good voice for narration and it feels very natural. I wish the video was longer because I'm such a big fan of SM64 (and some of the other games-videos you have); but I know that will come in time.  I hope you keep it up and keep pushing the limits. - With your presentation style and some more unique content you can really build and create an identity.  I subbed and hope to see more. Good luck!
casualnintendo,34iuoo,kupovi,2,Fri May 1 18:43:31 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much! I really appreciate the kind words. I was hesitant about putting out this type of video, so your feedback is very encouraging. Keep an eye out for more content like this to come :)"
casualnintendo,34iuoo,Witty_Retort_Indeed,2,Fri May 1 18:47:51 2015 UTC,"No problem brother!  I would go for it. The photos you took for the video were good quality, the overall video footage was very nice. -- It was fun to watch (and thats the name of the game)  I would just try and find a community to present to. I LOVE Nintendo but I think there are a ton of people who already cater to that audience (not saying you should give it up).  See if you can find some underrated games/gaming-topics and really build up a name.   Individuality is key with Youtube vids :)"

Thanks if you took the time out of your day to watch this, I've been on a Donkey Kong Country kick recently and decided to make a video about the games. This is a more ""silly"" video than I typically do, I'm writing this to ask for your feedback. There's a few jokes that I'm not entirely sure work, so if anyone laughed be sure to tell me. If you hated it, let me know as well! I'm always looking for suggestions so give some feedback and I'll improve for the next time :)"

At the moment, my wifi doesn't reach my current tv and I wanted to play the new Mario Kart DLC. I found out the Wii's component cable worked on the WiiU so I tried plugging it in. The result was a SD, flickering image. BUT I was able to play.  Anyways, as I said, I got a bit of shit for posting this in the WiiU subreddit and I just wanted to see what the reaction would be like in this subreddit."

casualnintendo,34h293,DoctorSteve,1 point,Fri May 1 05:56:16 2015 UTC,"Right. Components are the Red, Green, and Blue video cords (with another red and white off to one side for audio).  A way to remember the difference is composites are like anything else in life that's a composite: a mixture of two or more items. The Yellow video cable is a composite of the Red, Green, and Blue cables. The more you split the video into streams, the higher the definition.  Component is individual components of the composite cable.  3 Components (RGB) = 1 Composite (Y)."

casualnintendo,3211ya,Renigami,-9,Thu Apr 9 18:49:13 2015 UTC,"Goku is... overrated.  It is like rooting for that retard, who is strong because it is his one track mind, and stupid strength. It is something that audiences (some) relate to, because it is a message of ""hey I can be successful by being stubbornly strong and not needing to be aware of anything else other than battling"".  Goku, he has many justifications of a character - in developing growth from the ""condensed"" takes I have gathered.   No I am not about to sit through the original series as I have done with Naruto (yes, I went through at one point of my life through the last 150 episode fillers before Shuppuden) and One Piece (stopped at the Enis Lobby arc) of the past - of the NEXT TIME ON DRAGONBALL! AAAAAAAAHHHH AND THE NEXT TIME ON DRAGONBALL! AAAAHHHHHHH! AND THE NEXT TIME.... twenty-four episodes later in spongebob narration ...ON DRAGONBALL! IMATHROWMAHPUNCH! - all while side character commentary plays out. You can say I am sick of shonen series. Especially needlessly long ones that tastes like cardboard school cafeteria pizza.  From a power perspective, Sakurai knows that if Goku is included, there would be disappointment anyway. From power portrayal to movepool to balance, to fandom screaming NERF to their beloved icon, he knew. It is the same thing like Superman being almost exclusively eliminated in fighers - who wouldn't want to spam fly around, with fists forward to missile punch to death other rosters? It is possibly a reason why Mewtwo was given a hard look before being released impending via Club Nintendo (and possibly a paid character to everyone else that didn't jump at the opportunity).  If Sakurai didn't include Goku, it would be guaranteed disappointment too. Both ways would have garnered such. He rather save face by not work with something that can upset his intended vision of the game (fun while having players experiencing all the characters included or versus the characters included) and not be about a fiction pissing contest had he included it and be berated about the ""unfaithful"" adaptation. Hell, Goku FLIES ABOUT and HOVERS OVER the battlefield much like Gundam series of the past have done. THIS MECHANIC DEFEATS THE PURPOSE OF PLATFORMING FIGHTING that is Super Smash Brothers - the same way Superman would utterly fly around. Both are inherently able to fly as their base ability.  Now on the other hand, Kid Goku - may have a shot. He relies on Nimbus to fly, and wouldn't destroy the mechanics of Super Smash Brothers, much like Super Sonic and needing Chaos Emeralds to fly in space or just fly. Tails would fit too, he is limited on how long airborne he can do with his two tails. This is something people fail to realize and Sakurai should have explained better why Goku (no prefix or postfix words) isn't going to be put in despite blind popular opinion.  Now what? Just because a group of people disagree with a work, those said group will now gather together to form an off-work fighter that satisfies their Mary/Gary Sue desires only to find out - it isn't such a good idea after all.  /rant /opinion  Now the flying thing and Pitt, well he's a Nintendo character - and somehow it worked with him I guess. But his original portrayal, he never was fly spammy either.  TL:DR: Read the bold.  Edit:  Oh and less you forget, if you are downvoting because I smack talked Goku and some of my view on the fan's attachment, fine. I stand by that. Goku, is as one dimensioned as a character for me - from unknowingly happening upon marrying a girl, to just being a battle warrior in animated scenes that are akin to conflict cloud bubbles in their thrown punches. Goku's inspiration from Journey to the West maybe more to my liking, but I haven't had the chance to dive into that.  I also stand by my Mary/Gary Sue counter to why I think it is a bad idea to put Goku in along with his ki flying ability. Hell, in the Dragonball fighting games, it is a flying battlefield where you can literally be clear across the field, separated by that line that emphasizes to the players that you aren't next to the opponent. ALL characters fly in that game as a fighter - no smash ball or special conditions either. And those who still stand by Goku as being in Smash still want to vouch for this?"

casualnintendo,31zzsq,FlameMammoth,1 point,Thu Apr 9 14:10:28 2015 UTC,"Month 1: January  I started it off with Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze. The game is fantastic. I was really nervous about it ruining my thoughts of the original trilogy (SNES) but the game holds true it's values. It's dark as the originals, but bright at the same time.   Month 2: February  Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance was my second game of choice. I was fairly new to RPGs until this game. It was an excellent ""first RPG"" game, and I am definitely going to pursue the rest of the Fire Emblem series. There was a lot of strategy involved, and I enjoyed the puzzles much more than I anticipated.   Month 3: March  My third game to play was Conker's Bad Fur Day. I have heard this game was raunchy, and they weren't wrong. I understand it's mass appeal, and I think a lot of people who like Family Guy, also like this game. The humor in the game felt... immature? perhaps? I wasn't crazy about the story, but the multiplayer is so much fun. Teddy Bears and Squirrels war is great, and the samurai sword is something I wish there was more of in multiplayer shooter games.  Currently: April  Majora's Mask. However, I am playing the 3DS version of it. Before I go much further, is there much difference between 64 and 3DS version of it?  Up next: Pikmin 3   What should I expect? Without spoilers!  Thanks! Another update is coming in 3 months."

Check out some of Dorkly's Today in Nerd History videos to see some natural movements while on camera.   The sound your lips make just before you speak is also a bit distracting.   Lastly, the outfit you're wearing is actually pretty cool and fits in with the background, but the glare from your lights on your sunglasses sort of destroy that sense of depth that puts you in the Virtual Boy background.   Great video though. Can't really say I agree with your opinions, but that's why they're called opinions."

I might just repaint that part with some matte black. Similar issue with the glasses. The lamps are actually much too close due to the small size of the recording area, so I think I'll look at replacing the glasses with something less reflective, or maybe even ditch them altogether.

casualnintendo,31kjqw,Crafterkid123,18,Sun Apr 5 23:45:29 2015 UTC,"Well to be fair Nintendo has said the Mother series is done because the developer doesn't want to work on it anymore and Nintendo is respecting his wishes. F-zero can actually have a sequel, Nintendo just isn't making it."
casualnintendo,31kjqw,Fluffy_Banjo,5,Mon Apr 6 01:34:21 2015 UTC,Nintendo just isn't making it.   *Looks at Mario Kart 8*  It's getting there..
casualnintendo,31kjqw,philycheezestake,3,Mon Apr 6 04:13:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that isn't up to Nintendo to decide. Shigesato Itoi has said that he is done with Mother. It would be like Aonuma or Miyamoto saying they were done with Zelda and Nintendo continuing it with different creators."
casualnintendo,31kjqw,henryuuk,3,Mon Apr 6 01:37:58 2015 UTC,"uhm that is EXACTLY what would happen when aonuma and Miyamoto would call it quits. there have been zelda's made by other teams before, perfect example : the capcom games.    With mother it is different because Mother was pretty much completely the work of just Itoi, and was loved because of Itoi's 'feel' Also, Nintendo has no reason to continue the mother series compared to LoZ and Mario, cause it was a very niche cult-classic series that didn't actually sell that well."
casualnintendo,31kjqw,Manc0mbSeepgood,4,Mon Apr 6 02:15:43 2015 UTC,"the capcom games.    Which were overseen by Miyamoto and it was even his idea to trim it down to 2 games and have them link when Capcom originally wanted to make a trilogy.  I have no doubt Zelda would continue after Aonuma and Miyamoto call it quits, but only if Aonuma passes the torch like Miyamoto did for him."
casualnintendo,31kjqw,aidotato5,2,Mon Apr 6 03:17:30 2015 UTC,Wasn't the reason that it was only because it was fucking hard to link 3 games?
casualnintendo,31kjqw,Matsurosuka,2,Mon Apr 6 04:06:49 2015 UTC,The password system was too complex to have three games.

I'm a mod at /r/smashbros and have been part of the community for years, and I can safely say...  every single part of the community has it's annoying complainers, but they are always a vocal minority. the melee players, the Project M players, the SM4SH players, any combination, the competitive players, the casuals players. they all have people like that amongst them in a similar rate."
casualnintendo,31c7n0,henryuuk,1 point,Sat Apr 4 11:30:52 2015 UTC,"Then those who don't complain and praise the game need to speak up and be more vocal. Otherwise that is how people will view you.

There's nothing wrong about not being excited for something, but talking a load of crap about it just because it isn't what you wanted or wasn't expecting is stupid. I'm sure the excitement brought in lots of non community members and now that's it calmed down there isn't as much of those posts.

It isn't the sort of PM game everyone was expecting though. It's got some damn good visuals, a catchy soundtrack and some pretty fun gameplay as long as you're not after a full blown RPG.  I never played the first two so I guess thats why I feel alone in loving both Sticker Star and Super PM"
casualnintendo,310qbu,boxdude10,1 point,Wed Apr 1 12:35:50 2015 UTC,"I played Super PM after having played TTYD, and it is a completely different game. Super PM does have a few improvements, but it's honestly closer to a Super Mario Bros game than the first two PM games. I also don't think it's bad, in fact, I like a lot of the characters and stuff a lot more, but it's defiantly not the game people were expecting."

But just be warned that it's like Miyamoto just gave a box of parts to his younger brother to build something with. It has a really generic story, (Even worse than the original Paper Mario) no partners or abilities, very few characters, and there's only one puzzle gimmick that's used throughout the entire game, which gets old after chapter 1."
casualnintendo,310qbu,mistershmi,2,Thu Apr 2 01:50:49 2015 UTC,"It's really not that bad. Quite boring, definitely repetitive,  but still enjoyable.

Check out some things that they (and their graduates who now go to Rio Rico HS) have done: Nintendo Medley performed by them: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ry8uMEh0iI https://www.youtube.com/user/ChaosKeep/videos  In this competition, one school will receive 6 new brass instruments, valued at ~$12,000, which greatly exceeds the budget this school's band program has. In fact, it is about 10 times higher than the annual budget Coatimundi typically has to spend on its very talented students.  Please give these kids in a Title I area who otherwise can't afford to rent an instrument the opportunity to make some music.  I am not a student at Coatimundi, nor am I related to the band director or any teacher at Coatimundi, and I am not an IMC employee.  Please give it a vote, and post this to Facebook to get the word out.  The other front-runner's band director at Alice Vail Middle School, has been spouting baseless claims against Coatimundi alleging vote manipulation. https://www.facebook.com/Ladymaestro1/posts/10206588152086304  Here she claims that several other local schools are attempting to transfer their votes to Coatimundi, which is simply not true.  So, please vote for Coatimundi, copy the voting link into Facebook, and link to this post while doing a #Tag10 or #Tag20 type thing on Facebook to give this small school a chance to win."

casualnintendo,30dcyw,infinitelives,4,Thu Mar 26 16:55:10 2015 UTC,"Awesome. Those are some of the funniest — and saddest — reviews I've ever seen.  Al's review was the only one on point, and even though he personally disliked it, he still gave it the best score out of them all.  Best feature: It's unique  Worst feature: It's unique  Logic: Too hard, try guesswork!  Feels like math: Because it uses numbers!  It's a puzzle game: But nothing falls from the sky, WTF Nintendo?"
casualnintendo,30dcyw,Niflhe,4,Thu Mar 26 17:21:39 2015 UTC,"I think I like how Sushi X sad it wasn't a bad game, just not his type of game, but still gave it a 4.  Also in this issue is a review of Prehistorik Man giving it very high marks (8.875 and Game of the Month) along with a review of Ogre Battle: March of the Black Queen (7.875)"
casualnintendo,30dcyw,UnknownStory,2,Thu Mar 26 17:29:18 2015 UTC,"This is why the game review industry received a massive overhaul and, for most publications, an editor or two is assigned to a certain genre of game that they enjoy at least a little bit. Assigning ALL your reviewers to ALL games is very time consuming, requires many copies of the game OR more time to review that specific game thoroughly (how can they when the copy is already in use by another reviewer) and in the end the reader just ends up with biased opinions instead of an insightful review.  This, to me, is one of the things that hurt (not killed) G4. Adam Sessler is very, very insightful and Morgan Webb wasn't bad, it's just that if the game was something they didn't like or understood they (more Webb than Sessler but Sessler was prone to do it as well) threw it under the bus and plagued the review with cheesy sound effects."

casualnintendo,2zpe69,Super_Link,2,Fri Mar 20 19:39:14 2015 UTC,"The gameplay was alright, and the traitor storyline was really interesting, but I'd definitely say it was one of the weakest Metroid games.  The parts that required you to switch to 1st-person made it almost unplayable at times, and the whole authorization-upgrade became very clear as an excuse when you couldn't have the Varia Suit from the beginning.  EDIT: Also, the Ridley-breakdown.  She'd killed him 4 times at that point.  There's no reason seeing him come back for the third time should cause her to lose it like that."

casualnintendo,2zpe69,henryuuk,1 point,Fri Mar 20 21:47:47 2015 UTC,"The problem with the PTSD wasn't that she still had it, but that she didn't have it between the comic and Other M    Saying : ""she already killed him before"" is irrelevant. PTSD (or any form of mental trauma or even something like a phobia) is not just ; ""I overcame it once, it now has no effect on me anymore""      The real 'issue' is the fact the closest to reacting to Ridley she had before was standing still for the intro to the bossfight each time, which can hardly be considered PTSD."
casualnintendo,2zpe69,Shifter25,1 point,Sat Mar 21 03:24:02 2015 UTC,"That was my point, not that she should have gotten over it, but that it had never manifested before."
casualnintendo,2zpe69,henryuuk,2,Sat Mar 21 04:05:41 2015 UTC,Well it did in the (canon) manga. I guess the real issue is mostly the fact that the older games either didn't have a way to show the emotion (2D games) or where made by an external studio that wasn't as 'in' on the story.
casualnintendo,2zpe69,mythriz,1 point,Sat Mar 21 04:09:12 2015 UTC,"I didn't hate the game, but it definitely didn't feel quite as epic as any of the SNES or GBA Metroid games."

Please be kind, as I really only lurk and very rarely post!  I thought with Mario Party 10 around the corner, you all might like to see this video feature.  My Mom has been playing games for years, but my Dad hardly ever plays anything.  I've started a series where the two of them play games together...or in this case, against one another!    Like I said, this is just one entry in a series over on my YouTube channel, but I felt this one was most appropriate with the release date coming.  If you have any MP10 questions, please feel free to ask!  My apologies if posts like this aren't welcome or are flat-out incorrect."

Melee with me. Only happened once though, haha. She likes Tetris better. I posted this video to Facebook and she commented on it, but I told her not to feel bad because it looks like your dad plays less video games than she does.  I thought your dad's commentary was hilarious! Green Mario and White Kirby actually slaughtered me with laughter."

Then, when people inevitably start whining how sexist and cis-gender and what-have-you the character protrayals are, I will pull out some documents proving that about 50% of the ""Rambos"" are in fact intended to be female/transgender, and about 50% of the ""Playboy models"" are in fact intended to be male/transgender, and how sexist the whiners themselves are for simply assuming anything else.

casualnintendo,2zgcqx,Ancel3,-2,Thu Mar 19 04:58:43 2015 UTC,"Nintendo doesn't really have any sexualized characters. The closest one would be Samus, but she's a strong woman who don't need no man."
casualnintendo,2zgcqx,bookchaser,3,Wed Mar 18 16:32:32 2015 UTC,"A woman... in a skin-tight body suit. That's enough to dissuade a little girl looking for a strong female character. It was clear to her from the outset that Nintendo has female characters invented by men.  Edit: I just googled Samus to confirm. Yes, and according to one Wikipedia image... a skin-tight body suit and high heels. I hadn't noticed that bit before. Hey, whatever, all I'm saying is give girls some normal female non-sexualized non-princessized non-pink characters on top of whatever other ideas the game designers have about female characters."
casualnintendo,2zgcqx,Ancel3,0,Wed Mar 18 16:47:14 2015 UTC,"In most games though, she's in a big bulky armor suit. It's only until after the game and in Smash Bros (Which is developed mostly by HAL) that she's in the spandex."

I've only played one Metroid game before, and that was the Gameboy one that I got from Club Nintendo. Got about 45 minutes into it, got lost, and never picked it up again. Not a huge Metroid fan, but I do know the character of Samus from Smash Bros. and picking it up through other people's conversations.  And welcome to Nintendo, hope you have a good stay!"

casualnintendo,2yewjh,real-dreamer,1 point,Mon Mar 9 10:38:37 2015 UTC,Monster Manor/Street Pass Mansion
casualnintendo,2yewjh,Hazzat,1 point,Mon Mar 9 11:46:54 2015 UTC,I love Monster Manor.   I'm on floor 6 now. Is this from Monster Manor?   Just curious.   I have issues trying to get street passes so I always end up using coins.   But it's my favorite of the street pass games.
casualnintendo,2yewjh,henryuuk,1 point,Mon Mar 9 10:39:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this would have been late 20/early 30. It's from a while ago, actually."
casualnintendo,2yewjh,InShortSight,1 point,Mon Mar 9 11:51:29 2015 UTC,"I decided to give up on the later puzzle boxes and just use a guide. I wouldn't mind them if they were a real puzzle, but as far as I can tell it's just trial and error and you just have to luck out to beat the target time.  I admire your dedication!"
casualnintendo,2yewjh,InShortSight,3,Mon Mar 9 09:19:21 2015 UTC,Are there any puzzles that aren't solve-able with trail and error ?

I've been blogging for the last few years on a beer blog but decided it was time for another one as my hobbies get the best of me. Through this blog I'll be talking about my video game collection, news, etc. I'm a huge Nintendo fan at my core and most of the news I discuss will be geared towards them. Check it out and let me know what you think!"
casualnintendo,2xsbjt,adamddr,1 point,Tue Mar 3 14:01:24 2015 UTC,"So a gentleman on YouTube by the name of PowerToMario is attempting to hold an event in April called the Mariolympics. I'll put a link to the playlist here that explains what exactly is going on.  The main breakdown is that there will be different ""nations"" participating in different categories. Those categories are Retro Platforming, Modern Platforming, Racing, Sports, Party, and Smash. You can enter into, as of now, 3 of those categories after registering.  The events themselves haven't been released yet, but he has been sharing updates about the Mariolympics since mid-February. There also is a Google Hangout being hosted on March 13th. It will act as a Q&A session for interested parties.  I myself have registered and am really looking forward to this! As of last speaking with him, there are 57 people registered. Come take a look and see if it's something you'd be interested in!"
casualnintendo,2xrp2b,opinionatedfish,2,Tue Mar 3 08:31:06 2015 UTC,I hope mine comes soon; they initially cancelled my order as my address is a swamp in the middle of nowhere and they did not believe it existed.

And yes, the shirt has seen better days. It has been worn and washed many times."

I wish I had the time to find all my old stuff (some of it being other action figures, plush dolls, DK64 matchbox cars) but it may even be put up somewhere at my mom's house in storage. DKC always meant a lot to me. One for being such an awesome series, and two, it was three games (the original three) that my dad and I sat down and played through together back then. Glad the two newest entries are fun as well."
casualnintendo,2xo1gt,The_Darknut_Rises,1 point,Mon Mar 2 15:35:35 2015 UTC,Is that a 64DD version of DK64? I didn't know there was such a thing.
