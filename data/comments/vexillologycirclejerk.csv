vexillologycirclejerk,3e0t10,xcrissxcrossx,13,Tue Jul 21 02:09:02 2015 UTC,"No, It's the flag of France."
vexillologycirclejerk,3e0t10,yaguzi02,3,Tue Jul 21 05:59:24 2015 UTC,I think it's more the flag of Italy.
vexillologycirclejerk,3e0t10,micmac274,2,Tue Jul 21 09:51:20 2015 UTC,This is perhaps the most versatile flag there is!
vexillologycirclejerk,3e0t10,CannotIntoName,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:24:35 2015 UTC,It's the French battle flag.
vexillologycirclejerk,3e0t10,Hyperman360,3,Tue Jul 21 15:28:51 2015 UTC,I don't know what I expected.
vexillologycirclejerk,3e0t10,hydraulic0,3,Tue Jul 21 15:40:59 2015 UTC,Flag of Japan circa August 1945.
vexillologycirclejerk,3dvuoq,FoulCoke,2,Sun Jul 19 23:27:01 2015 UTC,Dont really get it. Because it's stripes and the US has stripes?
vexillologycirclejerk,3dvuoq,Sherafy,2,Tue Jul 21 00:57:51 2015 UTC,No. It was a proposed flag for Europe called the barcode flag.
vexillologycirclejerk,3dvuoq,Fuego65,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:17:35 2015 UTC,The 4 last blue strips only cost 5 Δρ
vexillologycirclejerk,3dup34,Stone_Crowbar,7,Sun Jul 19 17:34:00 2015 UTC,this is far to clever for this sub
vexillologycirclejerk,3dsnp2,InsertSomeName,6,Sun Jul 19 01:58:26 2015 UTC,"Frist of all, how dare you"
vexillologycirclejerk,3dsnp2,figureinplastic,3,Sun Jul 19 02:00:40 2015 UTC,how dare you   How dare Dankginia*
vexillologycirclejerk,3dsnp2,micmac274,2,Sun Jul 19 02:01:17 2015 UTC,Very original. France's battle flag should be the Napoleonic standard. I don't understand how a nation who produced the proto-Hitler and have a theme tune about killing oppressors get called cowards all the time. You're obviously thinking of the ITALIANS.
vexillologycirclejerk,3drhx1,yaguzi02,13,Sat Jul 18 19:24:38 2015 UTC,"... According to the Americans, the Japanese, and people who want to piss off the Welsh, Scottish and Irish."
vexillologycirclejerk,3drhx1,micmac274,9,Sat Jul 18 21:02:12 2015 UTC,So everyone but the people in Britain?
vexillologycirclejerk,3drhx1,waddledee5505,6,Sat Jul 18 23:22:08 2015 UTC,no them too it's everybody
vexillologycirclejerk,3drhx1,sdBOOGIE,7,Sun Jul 19 04:10:02 2015 UTC,"This is the Australian flag, I demand a refund"
vexillologycirclejerk,3drhx1,gonya707,8,Sat Jul 18 21:45:01 2015 UTC,"Only for 1/4th, so you'll only get 1/4th of the refund."
vexillologycirclejerk,3drhx1,Neciota,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:59:32 2015 UTC,Lol
vexillologycirclejerk,3drhx1,micmac274,2,Sun Jul 19 16:10:52 2015 UTC,"It's also a quarter of the flag of the Pacific Bestiality Association, according to u/RugbyTime."
vexillologycirclejerk,3drhx1,RugbyTime,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:03:01 2015 UTC,You called?
vexillologycirclejerk,3drhx1,micmac274,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:21:08 2015 UTC,"just saying that the NZ flag has a Union Flag in the corner, since it was a colony of the United Kingdom (and still part of the Commonwealth, with Her Majesty Elizabeth Windsor has head of state.)"
vexillologycirclejerk,3drhx1,InsertSomeName,4,Sun Jul 19 23:27:37 2015 UTC,"No, this is the confederate flag."
vexillologycirclejerk,3drhx1,UserIsInto,2,Sun Jul 19 01:51:10 2015 UTC,"Lol is it bad that I clicked this and said ""Uhm, what's funny about this? Isn't that the flag?"""
vexillologycirclejerk,3dsklj,Erzherzog007,3,Sun Jul 19 01:25:15 2015 UTC,Looks like the interim government of Iran in 1979.
vexillologycirclejerk,3dsklj,Guppyscum,2,Sun Jul 19 04:58:13 2015 UTC,One flag circle >>> many flags
vexillologycirclejerk,3dqadg,RugbyTime,2,Sat Jul 18 12:08:24 2015 UTC,"Now do the flag of the Pacific-Asian criminal ""continent."""
vexillologycirclejerk,3dqadg,I-Lu-v-Hy-p-hen-s,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:00:10 2015 UTC,Hue hue hue hue
vexillologycirclejerk,3dqadg,NigsAndJews-BadNews,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:54:57 2015 UTC,"Clearly this is the wrong flag, it should be this one.  It even has a sheep on it! Oh wait, that's the Atlantic Bestiality Association according to the Argentinians."
vexillologycirclejerk,3do7rt,elansz,4,Fri Jul 17 21:48:50 2015 UTC,Only 90s Soviets remember this.
vexillologycirclejerk,3do7rt,JustinPA,3,Mon Jul 20 02:48:48 2015 UTC,this is actually very pretty
vexillologycirclejerk,3do7rt,TorbjornOskarsson,3,Sun Jul 19 00:15:42 2015 UTC,"Thank you, comrade"
vexillologycirclejerk,3dnxzp,FoulCoke,9,Fri Jul 17 20:32:05 2015 UTC,It kinda looks like some cyprusized version of Eastern Berlin.
vexillologycirclejerk,3dmugr,Xuidj1105,4,Fri Jul 17 15:36:23 2015 UTC,Better than it is now
vexillologycirclejerk,3do61w,Militron,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:35:30 2015 UTC,Reminds me of the flag of the FORMER (seeing as how we're using capitals) Netherlands Antilles. Apparently the country was dissolved in 2010.
