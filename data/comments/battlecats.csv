battlecats,3e22j8,Skrub_Lord_Francis,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:35:50 2015 UTC,Are the new ubers in v3 better than the ultra souls? I have no uber rares and have only recently started getting true forms and crazed cats (2 of each) and I'm up to Pitfall Zone. I really don't wanna wait any longer for an uber but if the ultra souls are better by a reasonable amount then I will wait
battlecats,3e22j8,NeologistCat,3,Tue Jul 21 10:57:20 2015 UTC,"I agree with /u/zhang97tmd that Ultra Souls are better. Two things to consider, however. First, if it's like BCJP, the first gacha event after you update BCEN will be a guaranteed uber confirm for Dark Heroes. A guaranteed uber is hard to pass up when it's of this caliber. Second, to beat the new Space Cyclone stage, you're going to want as many anti-alien cats as you can field; and all the Dark Heroes are solid against the 'clone."
battlecats,3e22j8,zhang97tmd,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:32:04 2015 UTC,"I believe you wanted to post in the cat thread. anyway, ultra souls are still the most useful ubers in the game. if you dont have any ubers, I suggest you start with ultra souls/dragons. the anti-alien ubers are still situational as up till sol chapter 23, there arent any of them. this is just a suggestion, if you really cant wait a single day anymore, then get the anti alien ubers, but you may regret it later"

All of them are in Level 20.  Rares: Masai, Paris (32), Jurassic, Thor, Captain, Monk, Fisherman, Necromancer, Sorceress, Cupid, Swordmaster, Eastwood, Artist, Sashimi, Sick, genlteman, Sportsgirl, Gross Koi, Madam King, Vacation Queen, Creepmallow, Michaelangelo, Space, Rope Jump.

battlecats,3e22j8,thomasxin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:01:27 2015 UTC,"Ironically, I didn't use Crazed Wall to beat Ururun; I used Ururun to beat Crazed Tank! But use Paris, CWhale (for Bores), CMacho, Drama, KDragon,Bahamut, Kenshin (useful because of stats and effect for SBKs) and Mohawk, Wall, not necessarily in that order. Try to get Eraser, because that will mean you no longer need CWall. Getting Gato Amigo will increase your chances slightly, because they may knock back the bores with a chance."
battlecats,3e22j8,OhYeaReddit,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:24:47 2015 UTC,"/u/thomasxin have already mentioned a great line-up, I would just recommend stacking Bahamuts at the start before hitting the base. I think you can stack at least 2-3. If kept protected, it will help defeat the Ostrich faster (which commonly destroys your formation). Bores can be handled with Crazed Whale and probably another Anti-Red if your meatshields aren't strong enough, like Sorceress as a status dealer. Riceball might be viable here to respond quickly because of his speed but he is expensive. As mentioned, having Eraser Cat here will greatly help."

battlecats,3e0cl5,Nunuchu42,4,Mon Jul 20 23:55:18 2015 UTC,I see there is a combo that activates when you use all 4 machos--including metal cat found here: http://battle-cats.wikia.com/wiki/Metal_Cat_(Super_Rare_Cat). Is metal cat still unreleased? Or is it available some way I don't yet know about?
battlecats,3e0cl5,NeologistCat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:56:22 2015 UTC,"Seems like he is still unreleased. Seeing he doesn't get a level cap increase, as well as +LV; I think he must be a drop from a special stage, similar to crazed cats.  Still, lv20 metal cat with max treasure would have 12HP, that is freaking tanky considering he is metal. Too bad his cost is 600 (SoL) and cd is longer than king dragon."
battlecats,3e0cl5,Dialkia89,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:31:18 2015 UTC,"damn, that just removed the whole point of having him. he cant be used for anything."

battlecats,3e0cl5,thomasxin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:32:35 2015 UTC,"he doesn't get a level cap increase, as well as +LV   That means his cap is Lv20, just like crazed cat."
battlecats,3e0cl5,Dialkia89,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:46:50 2015 UTC,But then how do you get it? Beating a stage like Crazed Cat but with a metal Cat and a metal Bear or something??

You'll probably need 4 meatshields, level up hacker and stack them up and stack bahamuts, you could use kenshin but I believe her range is a little short so ururun will probably kill her...although she might help deal some damage to bores when they come out. Kuu same deal too short of range but maybe bring out for bores. Crazed fish should be leveled its a good cat and could help with bores and is cheap. Really just stack bahamuts maybe 3 or 4 with some hackers, use rich cat and sniper and maybe cpu for your meatshields if you're not quick enough.  Otherwise farm silver tickets to get some true forms."

battlecats,3dygz0,vecter,0,Mon Jul 20 21:24:54 2015 UTC,Unevolved form I'm assuming? Does leveling beyond level 10 even affect the unevolved form?
battlecats,3dygz0,vecter,2,Mon Jul 20 21:32:28 2015 UTC,Yes and yep it just affects his stats. Makes him stronger.
battlecats,3dygz0,zhang97tmd,-2,Mon Jul 20 21:35:39 2015 UTC,Oh it affects his unevolved stats? Are you sure about that?
battlecats,3dygz0,vecter,4,Mon Jul 20 23:10:25 2015 UTC,"dude, are you sure you know anything about bc at all? what kind of idea is that? unevolved form dont get increase in stats after lv10? dont be ridiculous, obviously the stats increase for both forms"
battlecats,3dygz0,zhang97tmd,-1,Tue Jul 21 00:49:07 2015 UTC,"whoa whoa whoa ... why so angry? I'm asking a legitimate question, calm down.  It's totally reasonable to assume that the unevolved form's stats cap out at level 10 but the evolved form's stats keep increasing. It's also entirely reasonable that the unevolved forms stat's would increase. It's an arbitrary choice by PONOS."
battlecats,3dygz0,twinmatrix,3,Tue Jul 21 01:34:31 2015 UTC,"im not angry, just amazed you would ask that. if you have ever went on bc wiki, you would know that for the damage of any unevolved cat, its max lvl is at 20/30+20/30. And come on, do you not realise your basic cats still have damage increase past lv10"
battlecats,3dygz0,vecter,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:16:10 2015 UTC,Just upvoted your post because I think it's lame other people downvoted just because you don't know everything about BC.

battlecats,3dygz0,vecter,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:55:35 2015 UTC,odd that there would be advantages to using an unevolved version.
battlecats,3dygz0,zukushikimimemo,2,Mon Jul 20 22:53:14 2015 UTC,"For most of the ultra souls, their unevolved forms are the best. That's b/c their abilities (jizo: 3x damage against dark + angel, momotaro: 30% freeze against red and angel, kaguya: 20% slow angel and metal) are best used when spammed, and the unevolved forms are very very cheap to spam."
battlecats,3dygz0,vecter,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:11:48 2015 UTC,Im quite confused. Jizo is black/angel 3x damage but in his description its floating/angel? So black is the correct one?

battlecats,3dwlje,menkent,2,Mon Jul 20 03:58:41 2015 UTC,"This is what can currently be seen from stats:   Range: OK-ish. Slightly less than Bahamut (all 3) Attack animation/rate: Sluggish animation (all 3), but Akira has quick attack cooldown. Cost and cooldown: cost more than Bahamut, but less than Dragon Emperors. Cooldown slightly less than Bahamut (all 3) HP and damage: not fully released yet. If I'd venture a guess, I'd say it is similar to Vajiras. Abilities: Akira and Saionji are more useful against alien due to good effect (freeze/knockback), but Catman is more useful in general since he can triple damage against 3 types (alien/floating/angel)"
battlecats,3dwlje,Dialkia89,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:29:38 2015 UTC,"Comparing them on the spica, they look much stronger than vajiras. Catman, for instance, starts with about the same stats as Takeda Shingen, but doesn't have his limitation and then gets x3. I'm sure is attack rate will be lower, but still. Vajiras is one of the lowest rated sets and is usually put just ahead of galaxy and dynamites."
battlecats,3dwlje,menkent,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:47:32 2015 UTC,"I was comparing them to the Vajiras set evolved forms. Vajiras evolved has much more stat than initial form, ranging from 1.5x to 2.5x. The Dark Hero set doesn't have improved stat when evolved.  Still, it's only a guess, since upper cap stat for them isn't released yet."
battlecats,3dwlje,Dialkia89,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:55:55 2015 UTC,Their damage and health can compare to dragon emperors
battlecats,3dwlje,xstreamstorm,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:59:29 2015 UTC,"After running through some number I think they are in between. Half of Vajiras is pretty low on HP/Dmg/dps (Yukimura, Nobunaga, Masamune), while the other half is pretty good (Keiji, Kenshin. And Shingen is a monster). The new set is about that good. Most of Dragon Emperor are also about that good (Raiden, Vars. Megidora and Kamukura a bit better), but the remaining are stat monsters (Sodom and Dioramos)  Note that this ""good"", ""better"" and ""monster"" rating only concern HP/Dmg/Dps, not overall usability."

Just spam AOE(Paris + Jizo or whatever you use) after that and don't get too proud after the ostrich is dead, the pigeons are pretty dangerous here."

Afaik thru testing, Android and iOS will reject older app install with Android say ""application not installed or install failed"" and iOS just say ""There is newer version installed already"". If you restoring apk thru backup, usually they uninstall current version first before installing older one.  But, if your save data is newer version than the backup.

battlecats,3duaff,Dialkia89,2,Sun Jul 19 16:05:51 2015 UTC,"I'd like to point out that it is not certain that he can do 3x damage to alien. I've seen no other source indicating that except that post from NeologistCat. Even the spica wiki only mention him being able to hit alien, nothing about 3x damage.  I've only peeked into BCEN2.1 data (thanks to EasyMoneko), and it's not that Shingen have the ability ""only damage black and castle"". He possesses the ability ""unable to deal damage"" to red, floating, metal, white, and angel, which translate to roughly the same thing. If that remains in the next version, he would be able to damage alien, but not 3x.  One thing I'm curious, that since Shingen's ability prevents him from damaging those enemies type, how about dual type (Black/Floating or Black/Red)? Can someone test if he can damage Black BunBun/ Black Cyclone/ Samurai Doggy?"
battlecats,3duaff,Dialkia89,2,Sun Jul 19 17:14:46 2015 UTC,"I went on spica, and it seems like there is nothing indicating that takeda deals 3x damage to alien enemies(fk), but i also want to trust neologistcat(how do i tag him?).

In doing my initial research, I was toggling between the BC wiki and spica to compare stats. As a consequence of repeatedly shifting between Shingen and Catman, I misread the line of stats and mistook Catman's stats for Shingen's. /u/Dialkia89 is correct in observing that while Shingen's damage against cyclone is high, in all likelihood, it isn't tripled against the 'clone.  I'm super sorry for the gaffe and misleading you with false information. I'll correct my post immediately.  Thanks for fact-checking my work.

As it is fixed quickly, no harm done, so don't be too hard on yourself. Really appreciate your work.  I've also learned something thanks to this. About how BC handles damage against multi type opponent. In all likelihood, it will calculate the damage against each type, and take the highest value. That would mean if PONOS ever release a Black/Angel enemy, Jizo would still deal 3x damage, not 5x or 9x."

Nurse Cat actually has a range of 435 (Megidora has 410 for comparison's sake) and has the same ability to deal with Floating. Of course, she isn't as fast as Megidora and her timr between attacks is longer, but at a cost of $4350 I think she's viable (The cyclone also seems to appear early).

battlecats,3drh9a,Harbinger_of_Kittens,12,Sat Jul 18 20:15:30 2015 UTC,"Interesting note, it's not a monk, but rather a jizo. Jizo are stone statues in the shape of monks, often in a prayer position, that are said to be guardians of children.   The whole character of Kasa Jizo is from the Japanese legend of such. On a snowy evening an old weaver was walking home after making a bunch of straw hats. He saw a row of jizo in the snow (they are often on roadsides in Japan in rows), so he went over and commented how they must be cold, so he gave them  his hats and put them on their heads.   Later that night he and his wife were at home, cold and hungry (poor couple), when they heard a knock on the door. It was the statues, who brought gifts of food and money.   I may be off on a few details, but that is the gyst of it. Interestingly, even now people often make red scarves and beanies for the statues, so if you see a jizo, it is usually wearing one or both."
battlecats,3drh9a,blznaznke,5,Sat Jul 18 22:25:16 2015 UTC,"I think the story goes that he tried to give each of them one of the hats he made, but he was one short.

While some may not be that game changing like Mohawk ( Macho Cat's true form), cats like Jamiera (Titan Cat's true form) gains 30% chance to knockback enemies and way better stats.  Also, if you manage to get your base upgrades to max (20+10), let's say Energy, you can exchange 5 excess base upgrades for a Rare Ticket. It's best if you max all of them so you can freely exchange whatever 5 base upgrade you get.  You guys might be fairly new in game, please check out the Battle Cats Guide and FAQ at the sidebar. Contains cat ratings, strategies and more!  There's also the ""Subreddit Rules and FAQ"" that contains FAQ important topics such as ""How to do the Energy Glitch"".  Edit: I think I commented on the wrong guy, should have been /u/prometheus199 o.o I probably have said too much, sorry."

battlecats,3dv090,zhang97tmd,2,Sun Jul 19 19:14:37 2015 UTC,"it refills your energy by messing with the time on your device. and like /u/definenine said, dont waste your radars on it, save them for the stages that give out cats."

Well I wanted a lot of silver tickets (ended up beating the stage 25 times, getting 25 tickets)... can't really manipulate your time that much, especially since every time I didn't have enough energy because I only had 480."
battlecats,3dv090,zhang97tmd,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:27:54 2015 UTC,"Same amount of energy, I reset the time every time I do the stage. Theres no downside to +2-2 it's just tedious"
battlecats,3dv090,magicalsandvich,2,Mon Jul 20 02:51:30 2015 UTC,"Wait, so you mean you can reset it backwards? I guess I didn't read the energy manipulation thread as thoroughly as I thought... I thought that say, it's 1955 here right now. If I set my time forward 1 hour to get energy, use that energy, I wouldn't be able to set my time back to the actual time until the real time had passed the time I set my phone to.  Didn't know you could keep switching back and forth. Hm. Thanks!"

Remember the wise word: Thy who not work does not deserve to get the food.  Atm. The only way I can think about is to ask someone with cheated save to transfer their save to you OR if you good with hex editor, you can try hex editing the file inside the Android/data for the cat stats which in my point view takes a really lot of time to figure out which one is the hex for cat stats (Well a 16 MB file means you are gonna browsing thru 16000000 hex addresses to find a single one for cat stats) but once you found it, it will be stay there."
