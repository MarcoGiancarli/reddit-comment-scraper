thalassophobia,3dycgw,DangerMacAwesome,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:21:31 2015 UTC,It's not so much a factor of depth as it is a factor of time at depth. Usually you won't be under long enough or with enough nitrogen in one breath to get the bends.
thalassophobia,3dycgw,I_sleep_on_the_couch,3,Tue Jul 21 01:09:13 2015 UTC,"So you get bends due to breathing air under pressure and then that air decompressing while in your blood stream, not from holding your breath. Breathing compressed air means there is more air in your system then your body would be able to handle normally.  If somehow you could hold you breath for a full day you wouldn't develop decompression sickness."
thalassophobia,3dycgw,kamker,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:39:20 2015 UTC,"Nitrogen narcosis is nitrogen in ur blood it makes u act retarted, bends is compressed air in your lungs that expands when you rise rupturring them which is why when diving with compressed air you exhale while ascending."

thalassophobia,3dugsf,hpcisco7965,21,Sun Jul 19 17:37:02 2015 UTC,"Some creature pictures are core to this sub. To me, thalassophobia is a fear of dark water, and a big part of that fear is connected with the idea that I cannot fully see what lurks beneath. In my opinion, ""good"" creature pictures are ones where the creature's presence in the photo straddles the line between seen/unseen.  A photo of dark water can certainly terrify, but a photo of dark water with the half-seen outline of a creature is more terrifying (to me, at least), because it gives the viewer a visual detail to latch onto BUT that visual detail is hidden enough that it also represents everything that the viewer can't see.    Many creature pictures have no place in this sub (in my opinion).  This is chiefly because many photographs of sea life are taken in shallow water. Additionally, many creature photos are composed with the creature as the focus of the image, and the water is used only as a supporting element; these types of photo do not give the viewer a chance to really connect with the water in the photo. For many creature photos, the backdrop is blue water that might as well be a blue piece of cloth. Finally, I am personally turned off by creature photos that leave nothing to the imagination.    I agree that posters should spend a moment contemplating what ""thalassophobia"" means, and be more thoughtful when choosing images.  But I think there is a place for certain creature photos and I hope we do not lose sight of that."

thalassophobia,3dugsf,TheSushiHero,5,Sun Jul 19 16:49:21 2015 UTC,"I agree they can be.  This post actually does a good job as it shows not just the shark, but the vast unknown around it.  I think the issue is, at least for me, posts that focus on the creature versus the sea."
thalassophobia,3dugsf,mrbobsthegreat,2,Sun Jul 19 18:48:47 2015 UTC,I feel like people start to stretch their case when they post pictures of animals outside of the water.
thalassophobia,3dugsf,qweiopasd,13,Sun Jul 19 21:56:01 2015 UTC,"The thing with this kind of thing is that whether something is thalassophobic enough or not is very subjective. We are deleting a lot of posts which are clearly not in line with this subreddit's purpose (like a picture of a caught fish) but a picture of a shark can give that creepy vibe, the fear of a vast sea and also the fear of having a creature swim below you.   But don't get me wrong, we absolutely agree that we should be fiercer with handling shark and whale posts. We are thinking about doing a ""no sea creatures"" week where we will remove every post with a sea creature in it and see how the subscribers will feel after it.   Another important note on shark/whale posts and reposts is that you should immediately report every post which you think does not belong in this subreddit or is a report. I can't stress this enough, since we can't check every single post all the time. And when we are doubting that a post belongs here or not, the fact whether it has reports or not really decides whether we remove it or not.   TL;DR: we are aware of the problem and we will try to slow it down by holding a ""no sea creature week"", but please report every single post which you think is either a repost or irrelevant  We are doing our best to help our community!"

There are far more people severely stung by jelly fish yearly than shark attacks, and thats because some jellies are transparent and hard to see.

I remember looking in the tank and seeing nothing but blue, I walked around a bit and then looked again. There was a Great White shark in the tank and it was massive. It is taller than a person just from the top of their back to the belly (their diameter), not to mention nose to tail. This behemoth was gingerly swimming inside the tank and made me realize how fucked I would be if I was ever in the water. The image of that shark swimming towards me might be the same if I were in the water with it. Ever since then I appreciate how massive some animals are."

thalassophobia,3det08,estafan7,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:06:47 2015 UTC,"Monterey Bay Aquarium had baby great whites on display beginning in 2004 with the program being officially terminated in 2013. They went through a rigorous selection process of sharks that were caught prior to individuals being placed in the aquarium. The sharks were removed from the ""Outer Bay"" tank and released in the wild if the animal begins to display aggressive behavior to the other animals in the tank (tuna, sunfish, sea turtles, other sharks, etc.), show signs of agitation (ramming into the sides of the tank, not eating), or when they reach a certain size- which I believe is about 200 lbs. They have to remove and release the sharks from the tank prior to them reaching a size that would make handling the apex predator difficult and (more) dangerous. I have been fascinated by sharks since I was a little kid and, as a Bay Area resident until 2009, was able to visit frequently so spent a ton of time watching sharks number 1-4 they had on display. It was amazing to see them and be able to wantch them but they were not very big- lots of the tuna outweighed them :)"

thalassophobia,3det08,bryanrobh,2,Sat Jul 18 01:48:16 2015 UTC,I know! I was so sad when I heard the program had been suspended. Apparently the last couple of sharks died after being released back into the wild. MBA is very focused on ocean conservancy so this was unacceptable to them as well as to the public. Their was a decent amount of public outcry that the sharks weren't doing well since they weren't able to be successfully released which may have played a role in the program being shuttered.

thalassophobia,3det08,5secondstozerotime,-2,Thu Jul 16 04:34:04 2015 UTC,I see the shark and the monster's throat. What sea are you talking about?

thalassophobia,3dhj1z,brainotomy,7,Thu Jul 16 14:54:19 2015 UTC,Just watch out for their huge retractable penises.

Anyhow, every time the water bubbled up, I'd ask her what's that!?  The story in this video...I don't want to imagine.  I was hoping their GoPro footage would be available."
