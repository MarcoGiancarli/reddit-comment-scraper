What I can say is that I've lost more money in ""lost cards"" and trading for sub NM cards while paying the MN premium and generally having issues with the interface of their website in a few months of usage than I have had in 3-4 years of selling thousands of dollars of cards on ebay and TCG."

mtgmarketwatch,3e2pod,admrla,2,Tue Jul 21 16:48:40 2015 UTC,This is normal. On TcgPlayer you have to spend at least a dollar not counting shipping to buy from a seller.

mtgmarketwatch,3e2pod,admrla,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:49:51 2015 UTC,I think this card has a new price of like $2 but it probably isn't worth the work to buy the current copies atm. If the Naya CoCo deck ends up being a thing this could be a $5-10 card. Foil Deceiver Exarch is $15.

Flyers are usually better than islandwalkers. Otherwise, in a Ux deck with lots of draw spells, Skulker seems more economical (TC grows it by 3)."
mtgmarketwatch,3dv43s,zszugyi,6,Mon Jul 20 22:25:14 2015 UTC,"The important part of the card is that you can use it as a 2 drop, and it's still good value.  If you're playing a control deck then you really don't have any good 2 drops to play. Playing random Jaces or something like that isn't very good value because it just turns on your opponent's dead removal. Same thing with Chasm Skulker, if you play it, and it gets killed at EOT or on the opponent's turn, then you don't get any value off of it.  Hangarback Walker on the other hand is still good value even if they use their removal on it, because their removal probably cost more than the 2 mana you spent on it, and you even got an evasive threat out of the exchange.  TL;DR: It's a good cheap control threat that doesn't ""turn on"" the opponent's removal."

mtgmarketwatch,3dqk3n,gamblekat,3,Sat Jul 18 17:12:20 2015 UTC,"Some people are dicks about trading, other people are fine.  My advice is to only have things in your binder you're willing to trade and to be flexible when you need something specific.  That being said, never let someone bully you in a trade.  If you ever start to feel it, just break it off."
mtgmarketwatch,3dqk3n,Lalagah,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:26:49 2015 UTC,"I agree with everyone having a different view on trading and needing to be flexible, but that being said, you do not need to only have things you are willing to trade in your binders.  I think there many ways to go about trading different levels of cards.  Personally, what works for me is having a few different binders for different audiences and traders.  If someone asks me to trade I usually hand them two small and medium value cards with mixed formats.  If they then have cards that I need or am willing to trade up for I show the higher value binder.  That has many cards towards the back I am for the most part unwilling to trade, unless there is something I really really need or if the format is similar for price.   Example...   Me: I need your playset of Siege Rhinos Them: Ok thats about $16ish I will take your Beta Ice Storm Me: No I'd rather trade that for something slightly harder to come by. Them: Why not they are about the same price? Me: Its quite alright if you don't want anything else but I would still would rather not.   So if that makes me a dick than I am sorry you feel that way.  Sure I can go online, find a cheap Ice Storm and rebuy it, but I can just as easily open a pack and get a Siege Rhino, or do the same online. The other side to that is when someone has older rarer stuff and wants the same cards, they are now for trade.   You are right to never let someone bully you around, its just as easy to close a binder and say no thanks. The fact is, trading is different than online shopping.  It all depends on the person and the cards, it should be looked at as a fun way to acquire cards and not as a serious stressful situation."
mtgmarketwatch,3dqk3n,earthbinder,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:09:53 2015 UTC,I have trouble trading off standard cards at my LGS because of this exact same reason. I usually just sell my standard cards on tcgplayer or trade them on Facebook.

mtgmarketwatch,3dqk3n,Little_Gray,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:12:45 2015 UTC,I have only had issues with people holding on to useful/sentimental type cards. I generally do equal value trades without much issue though (besides people holding onto cards for non-finance reasons).
mtgmarketwatch,3dqk3n,SmithKurosaki,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:42:40 2015 UTC,"It's very hard to get trades done these days, between everyone looking up prices and people having 2/3 of their binder as ""thats a spec"" or ""thats for a deck"" trades can be painfully long.  I'm pretty relaxed on trading, I don't check prices and I just point to what I want. I generally go through other peoples stuff first to see if there's stuff I want and if there is, I let them go through my trade boxes and pull out whatever they want and propose a trade. You'd need to carry enough stuff on you to have just about anyone to be able to pull enough stuff out for a trade though.  I really just recommend using online trading though, much easier to post on facebook ""trading my fetches for cavern of souls"" and waiting for a response, or going to pucatrade/deckbox"

mtgmarketwatch,3dqk3n,math_ninja,3,Sun Jul 19 02:37:24 2015 UTC,"I really wish people followed my rule of thumb for trade binders:  Only put things in your binder that you're willing to trade and keep everything else in a separate binder.  It really helps in keeping local trades effective and not having to constantly ask whether something is for trade or not.   Of course what you're dealing with is people not realizing that, as a player, its not smart to hold cards you're not playing because ""they will go up in value."" Are you really going to get more value out of holding on to those cards for X amount of time than trading them for cards you will actually use and have fun playing with or use to win at your LGS and get store credit?  If you're not looking for any cards why not trade them for other cards of equal value?  If you're not using the cards and you're not trading them, what value do they really have anyway?  Edit: Forgot to give advice.  I would try online trading.  Deckbox and Pucatrade are both great ways to trade.  It is much easier to find willing traders with what you're looking for."
mtgmarketwatch,3dqk3n,Grasswalker,7,Sat Jul 18 17:06:14 2015 UTC,"Every card in my binder is for trade. However not all trades are the same, you can't have my nm Underground Sea for equal value standard high staples. I don't want them, and I'll tell you this.  Idk man, don't blame me for not wanting to trade, it's nobody's fault you might not have something I want, like Stoneblade foils, which I'd trade for the Sea happily."
mtgmarketwatch,3dqk3n,math_ninja,2,Sat Jul 18 17:11:28 2015 UTC,"I didn't necessarily mean a trade comprised of equal value. Obviously most people wouldn't trade down a dual land for standard cards. I meant trading cards for other cards that will hold up the same value, like trading duals for wastelands or abrupt decays for shocks or fetches.  I too have everything available for trade in my trade binder but some things have to be for the right trade."
mtgmarketwatch,3dqk3n,Grasswalker,2,Sat Jul 18 17:38:47 2015 UTC,"Sometimes I'm just looking for a few things, if I have 20 Abrupt Decay, but no Playset of Foil Deathrites, I'll probably hold still. Even more so if I think your cards are due for a reprint, or will drop.  You can't force people to trade with you ""because it's equal value"", as different people speculate differently. I might not have any faith in Fetches, rightfully so when they get printed in Ktk, and yet many people got frustrated I wouldn't trade Onslaught Fetches at 70$+ for other high end cards, because I didn't want them.  Flooded Strand Onslaught x4 was valued at around $~250+ easily, and yet I wouldn't have traded $~110 value in 2 Taigas for it, because I felt Fetches would die, and reserved list will continue to rise.  Equal value isn't always equal to both people. God forbid you start comparing TCGPlayer, MagicCardMarket, SCG, etc. Some people only trust certain sites, or don't trust any, and value themselves."

Yes people have to agree to trade cards and people will value cards differently. I also mentioned trading for cards that will hold equal value, but that is up for people trading to decide.   Also my original point was that if you have cards in a trade binder and you don't plan on trading them (the issue that OP is having) then you should take them out."
mtgmarketwatch,3dqk3n,KangaRod,0,Sat Jul 18 18:50:46 2015 UTC,"I agree. I hate when people have cards in their binder that aren't for trade and they just want to show off.  Actually one of the main reasons I don't bother to trade IRL anymore. If I do, it's usually buylisting as I just can't be bothered to go back and forth over $2 or $3 of value"
mtgmarketwatch,3dqk3n,Xfanjaud,-4,Sat Jul 18 19:34:22 2015 UTC,"I also find it tough... But there is a way: make it look like a bargain. Sell/exchange at lower price than fair value to get the cards you need. If these people are looking to make a profit, they will be interested. For exemple, when conspiracy came out, i sold the 2 dack fayden i opened at 25 usd when they were valued at 50 but expected to fall. Of course nobody would have accepted the deal at 35, but 25 sounded like a bargain... Until it fell to 15. Of course, now i wish i had kept them, but it's about trading away stuff you do not want."
mtgmarketwatch,3dqk3n,Mana_Drain,6,Sat Jul 18 16:19:17 2015 UTC,"I don't agree with this. Not to the extreme that you've suggested. Taking a 50% haircut on the value of your cards just doesn't make sense. Sure, if you really need a card then 10% off your cards to trade for stuff you really need or trading standard into eternal staples I can get behind.    I guess your example was for cash so that's a bit different. My point is that there should be a limit to the hit you absorb to make a trade."
mtgmarketwatch,3dojkw,Johanson69,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:29:00 2015 UTC,$33 retail....  split between   collected company siege rhino windswept heath   If you split the retail 3 ways... you get $10 each...  but rhino is around $4  so cap the other two at 13ish... which means Collected/heath goes down short term until clash packs run out.
mtgmarketwatch,3dojkw,jcmtg,5,Fri Jul 17 23:44:22 2015 UTC,"What exactly do you mean by run out? Clash packs don't run out, they're reprinted if there's demand. The last time there was a ton of value in an event deck type product, the prices all permanently tanked. (Boros Gatecrash event deck)."
mtgmarketwatch,3dojkw,5-s,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:37:39 2015 UTC,"I kind of disagree with the reprint on demand. I bought two M15 clash packs last fall for the Courser, Nykthos, and a couple of other green devotion cards and then they completely dried up and none of my LGS ever got more back in stock after the first few weeks. We always asked for them, but they were unable to get any more from distribution for some reason."

Something will get reprinted in standard or commander and drop. The meta will move wherever it goes and some decks will lose/gain modestly. Some random uncommon will spike and everyone will whine, but it'll be an uncommon that we didn't know we needed to have around (ala Heritage Druid)  The only things that would move me off that general assumption are:   Real land hate enters the format (Closer to Wasteland/Blood Moon than Tectonic Edge/Ghost Quarter). This would cause a huge meta shift, a bunch of complaining, and might push people off a lot of decks and cool demand as decks scale back color requirements. MM3 gets announced for 2016. It'll quash demand until the set releases and I would imagine (rightly or wrongly) that people will sell into the announcement for fear of price drops."
mtgmarketwatch,3dduq7,EvenDeeper,2,Wed Jul 15 20:58:46 2015 UTC,"One thing people do not seem to realize: the more cards enter the Modern card pool, the more cards will see play. Therefore, we will need an exponential increase in the number of reprints to sustain the demand. Unless Wizards start printing Modern Masters every year AND include Modern staples in the upcoming sets on a regular basis, all cards will see a steady increase unless reprinted (do you know that Ancient Stirrings, a common card from RotE, is a $3.50 card?).   Naturally, once a card is reprinted, the price will fall down. For how long, though, it is not entirely clear. We can expect a steady increase after a year or two in case of format staples. Cards relevant to one specific deck (infect, boggles) will see a huge drop once reprinted. This is ultimately the Modern conundrum. You will lose a lot of money if you do not sell AND you will lose a lot money if you decide to sell a card that will not be reprinted for a year or two."
mtgmarketwatch,3dduq7,Little_Gray,3,Wed Jul 15 21:22:27 2015 UTC,Same thing as this year and last year and the year before.  Cards prices will spike during modern season and then slowly drop back down until the next modern season.
mtgmarketwatch,3dduq7,Little_Gray,3,Wed Jul 15 19:16:00 2015 UTC,"There was a solid post from a user on Saffron's article about deck pricing rising 25% across the board. It basically pointed out that the announcement of MM2015 ""suppressed"" the value of most modern staples until we had the full, official spoiler of the set.  Unless we have another format warping card like CoCo, do you see the spikes being as volatile as this year?"
mtgmarketwatch,3dduq7,FranticJ3,3,Wed Jul 15 20:51:10 2015 UTC,"If a new deck breaks out then obviously those cards are going to spike.  It does not matter if the deck is actually good or not as long as it gets attention.    The problem I have with Saffrons article is that it included a lot of decks that simply did not exist six months ago which skewed the results a lot.  The other issue is that you cant fairly compare prices of decks during peak modern season and the off season.   Prices spiked because of the massive demand from MMA2, multiple modern gps, and modern season.  Even now prices are dropping across the board and in six months they will be a lot closer to what they were.  We are seeing similar spikes this year as we did two years ago after the first modern masters and a massive influx of modern players.  Since that wont be the case next year it should not be anywhere near as volatile, instead it should be much more like last year.    It is also going to depend on what cards get printed in the next year as well.  The reprint of fetches dropped the price of decks across the board by hundreds of dollars."
mtgmarketwatch,3dduq7,jawdirk,4,Wed Jul 15 21:29:49 2015 UTC,"I see them dipping down by then.  I'm no expert, but modern season has increased the interest in Modern but it probably won't stick.  The prices are too high for anyone new to get into the format (unless they just have plenty to spare to jump into a more complex format than Standard) so I'd say mostly the prices will drop.  That's not to say they'll hit their previous prices before this huge spike but I definitely believe it'll be cheaper than it is now.  EDIT:    I've got my own opinions on the matter, but I'm interested to hear what others think.  I'm no expert   Giving my opinion gets me downvoted.  You da real MVP reddit"
mtgmarketwatch,3dduq7,FranticJ3,2,Wed Jul 15 14:43:20 2015 UTC,I think a lot of casuals buy some number of modern staples even if they don't plan to build a modern deck. Professional magic inspires the demand but it is not the only source of the demand.

Has turn 3 to 5 kills mostly, and really punishes greedy mana bases.  For a new player to modern its fantastic.  It doesn't require a heap of meta knowledge, and helps if you can read the board.  Given that most decks in modern win with creatures turning sideways, this is a great skill to have.    Like I said, this deck isn't going to set the world on fire and win fnm. But it will however beat a lot of mediocre pilots on established decks,  and will teach someone the game.  I could not recommend a budget deck any higher"

mtgmarketwatch,3dduq7,FranticJ3,0,Thu Jul 16 02:17:51 2015 UTC,"So trying to summarise your post:   the price of entering the format will cause lower demand from new players for current modern cards; and modern season at present has inflated the prices. A year from now they will be lower.    Quite frankly, I am not surprised you got downvoted.   What makes you think the current prices are a result of new players entering the format, that will cease? Their is a significant portion of demand for modern cards by existing players.   A year from now we will be in modern season again.  To think the spike this year won't occur again next year is a guess.   Your opinion is more wishful thinking than anything in my view.   I have no view on where prices will be in a year, and in any event I expect something unforseen will occur between now and then impacting prices.

As RDW/aggro tends to do quite well in ""unsolved/unknown"" metas, I can see the $13 price potentially sticking if people do well with him in Standard (top 8s, etc). Moreover, if Goblins becomes a thing in Modern, that'll help bolster his price as well. That said, if Modern doesn't happen and he isn't part of a top8 deck, I foresee him dropping. $10+ standard rares are more the exception than the rule...   That said, if he top 8s in the next couple of weeks in Standard... the $$13-$15 range seems reasonable. If he top 8s in modern too, then we could see him go higher than that.

While I'm not saying there's not value to be had, I'm saying your comparison and the language you're using is extremely hyperbolic.

mtgmarketwatch,3dcjb0,SmithKurosaki,11,Wed Jul 15 05:08:18 2015 UTC,"This question is huge, and essentially what all of us are trying to figure out.  But we have some head starts over you, so I'll divulge some basics, and hopefully someone after me will add some more, and we'll just keep on keeping on.  It's all about supply and demand.  Supply is how much of a product we have available. Demand is how much people want that product.  Low Supply, Low Demand = low but highly volatile price.  You get price charts like http://mtgstocks.com/cards/20091.  It's very easy to influence the price of this card (I.E. you could buyout TCGplayer by yourself), but then no one wants the card, so you can't sell it, and you don't profit.  High Supply, Low Demand = terribly low prices, unable to move the card.  For a rare this can mean something like Blood Chin Fanatic.  The epitome of this is Giant Spider (printed 16 times, never standard playable).  Only get these if you can get them for free, and hope that demand rises.  High Supply, High Demand.  These are trendy standard cards or eternal staples with multiple printings.  The Khans Fetchlands qualify, but Lightning bolt is the poster boy.  These tend to be easy to sell, but their price is not terribly high, and is unlikely to get terribly higher.  Excellent pickups if you're a backpack dealer with high velocity, but if you make your sales via mail you may find yourself spending your profits on stamps.   Low Supply, High Demand -  Serum visions is a $14 common that sees play in a ton of decks.  Snapcaster Mage is an $80 from a post-mythic set.  These cards tend to be very easy to move, since if you're selling, everyone is buying.  Supply is affected by rarity, print runs, and number of printings. in Khans of Tarkir  each common is printed at .1 per pack  each uncommon is printed at .0375 per pack  each rare is printed at .0167 per pack  each mythic is printed at .0074 per pack  Therefore  Each uncommon is 2.66 times more rare than each common  each rare is about 6 times more rare than each common  each mythic is 13.5 times more rare than each common.  Number of printing affects supply because each of it's print runs needs to be added together to determine supply.  Print runs is a stickier wicket.  Each new Standard-legal set tends to have a greater print run than it's counterpart from last generation, but the quality of the draft format impacts the numbers.  Khans had more opened than Theros, but Return to Ravnica also had more opened than Theros.  That's because Return to Ravnica was a better format with better cards in it (highly scientific, right?).  Theros, however, has a larger print run than Zendikar even though Zendikar was awesome and they're both Fall sets, because the number of magic players has risen since 2009, and those players open packs.  Fall sets tend to have the largest run, because they're drafted the longest (and usually three packs). Spring sets tend to have the shortest run, because they're drafted the least (and usually only one pack) Summer sets tend to have a middling print run (more than spring, less than winter) because they're drafted for a good long while, but they tend to suck, so they aren't drafted religiously.  The best way to invest in the short term is to anticipate sudden changes in supply or demand    A change in demand comes from an old card finding a niche (like Nourishing Shoal) or having a new card printed that combos with is (kinda like gifts + unburial rites, but I'm sure a better example could be mustered).  A change in supply usually comes from a card getting reprinted.  If you buy cards before they increase in demand, and sell cards before they increase in supply, you will find profit.  edit: formatting and spelling."

mtgmarketwatch,3dcjb0,stitches_extra,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:26:55 2015 UTC,"I think you're right.  Theros had huge casual demand with the god cards and such.  RTR brought the biggest influx of people, but there were more playing during Theros as a result IIRC."

I'd add:  A change in demand comes from the tournament deck lists from large events, which usually prove the power of a deck and thus the cards within it."
mtgmarketwatch,3dcjb0,jcmtg,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:43:51 2015 UTC,"Hello, If you are talking about european MKM one thing you can do is reading what's going on USA, tournament coverages and financial blogs. When a card spikes in USA it takes 1 or 2 days to spike in Europe and you can push up the value of your collection buying sonething cheap that doubles or triples in few days. A thing to consider is to diferenciate buyouts that don't go anywhere from real spikes that mantain his price. For example when goryo's vengeance spike I quickly bought a foil for 22€, now It's going for 40 in europe and almost double in USA. Avoid buying cards that are at maximum of his hype because normally they will go down with time. My best advice is to read a lot everyday and in a few time you will be able to invest wisely. I'm not an expert only a man who played from revised to 5th edition and two years ago feel the worm of Mtg again. Now I'm a collector more than a player but feels good when you sell cards that have no upside and then buy cheap cards that go up and pushes the value of your collection."

mtgmarketwatch,3dcmzi,taoofsteve88,4,Wed Jul 15 05:48:32 2015 UTC,I honestly can't imagine these kind of cards ever going down. They seem like the safe investment type of cards. Their value has nothing to do with playability and everything to do with collectibility and that's not changing any time soon.
mtgmarketwatch,3dcmzi,Tyisisbest,4,Wed Jul 15 07:31:42 2015 UTC,"Be aware that the cardstock for some of the Euro lands is different than most cards, so they are in effect ""marked"" and must be double-sleeved.

mtgmarketwatch,3dcmzi,manelmolina,8,Wed Jul 15 06:13:22 2015 UTC,I can vouch that Japanese cards aren't cheaper in Japan. I was there last year trying to aquire a massive Japanese card collection.

mtgmarketwatch,3dcmzi,Little_Gray,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:22:36 2015 UTC,"As others have said, I don't really see these cards ever losing value. They're old, unique, and pretty.

I paid 1€ for each one of them, and now? they are around 20€, awesome! :)  I also bought a bunch of Alpha-Beta lands at 1€ each one (mostly Played, but still good). Bad thing is I do not want to sell them because I really love my lands, and I use them on my decks (double sleeved of course)."

I have always had a thing for basic lands, and coming from the APAC region (New Zealand) I do enjoy playing with these. I decided that these would be my basic lands of choice a while back and made some purchases several years ago of my favorite of each of the types I liked most. Didn't buy them for the ""investment"", but they do seem to have maintained their value, and some (especially the mountains) seem to have appreciated significantly.  While I like them all, my favorite is probably the Hong Kong Island (though I only have 12). I have 25 copies of the Chinese Forest, Philippines Mountain, Aussie Plains, and New Zealand Swamp.   Going forward I'll hold onto them regardless of what happens to their value so I'm probably not the best one to ask, but I generally agree with others that they're likely to hold their value and likely appreciate further over time."

mtgmarketwatch,3d0suj,echomtg-com,0,Sun Jul 12 15:54:12 2015 UTC,"I couldn't believe how low it was when I bought a copy for my cube six months ago.  It may not be a $15 card, but it deserved to be higher than $3. It will probably drop a little, but but I wouldn't expect to see it as low as it was last week ever again."
mtgmarketwatch,3d0suj,bfro,12,Sun Jul 12 15:52:50 2015 UTC,"Why?  Its not a particularity good card, not playing in anything and for the time they gave out a ton of them.  All the other unplayable ones are in the $3 range so thats about the right place for it."
mtgmarketwatch,3d0suj,Little_Gray,3,Sun Jul 12 17:48:24 2015 UTC,"its a cube staple IMO. That's not a multi-format all star by any means, but it's also a long way from unplayable. There is a reason the pack foil has a 15x multiplier."
mtgmarketwatch,3d0suj,jimini-christmas,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:11:26 2015 UTC,"This is the answer.  Yes it is absent in Legacy, Modern, and even EDH, but it is a cube staple.  People love to pimp their cubes, and this is a good way to take care of this slot."
mtgmarketwatch,3d0suj,bfro,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:32:55 2015 UTC,"Yes and cube players do little to move the prices of cards and they are a relatively small group.  Its also only a ""cube staple"" in a specific type of cube."
mtgmarketwatch,3d0suj,Little_Gray,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:01:49 2015 UTC,"They do enough that the pack foil of this ""unplayable"" is $6. It's pretty dangerous to completely discount entire formats. Especially ones that require such a substantial financial investment."
mtgmarketwatch,3d0suj,jimini-christmas,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:31:23 2015 UTC,Did you know that foil Steamflogger Boss is nearly $6?  A card that was literally a joke is nearly the same price.  Just because something is worth a few dollars does not mean it is good or playable.
mtgmarketwatch,3d0suj,Little_Gray,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:40:15 2015 UTC,but $6 does indicate demand for the card. In the case of steam flogger it is the fact that it is a joke that is causing demand. Little girl is a $20 foil despite being illegal in all formats. Just because a card isn't playable in the formats you play doesn't mean there isn't demand. I'm simply trying to help you understand where the demand for this card is coming from. It's from cube in case you hadn't heard me earlier. Obviously there was sufficient demand/supply ratio to cause a price change. Saying that the card isn't desirable is factually incorrect.

mtgmarketwatch,3cnqk3,Tyisisbest,4,Thu Jul 9 09:35:43 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't see it being huge in burn considering they are already splashing greens or white making it difficult to fit this. Also it's not completely uncommon to see a burn deck not hit 3 mana. On the flip side, I could see it being in a delver deck easily. They already run blue. It does ruin their delve but they could always delve first. It also turn opposing tarmogoyfs off though. Overall I would say the price is probably justified, since this is definitely the most exciting card in the set for modern but I wouldn't expect it to go up. Also it will be difficult to justify 4 in the main because against certain decks it is probably just insta-lose (burn, affinity, other delver decks)."
mtgmarketwatch,3cnqk3,ReverseLBlock,3,Thu Jul 9 10:21:44 2015 UTC,"I agree. This card seems to me like it would fundamentally change Burn/Affinity. Sometimes these decks have issues even getting to three mana. Anytime after turn three, this card seems like hot garbage. You're just giving your opponent more looks at their deck to find their hoser.  As a player in Modern, I am always on the best BGx deck (Jund now). Me being able to find my Shatterstorm right after a Day's Undoing is just the best possible thing I can imagine. Burn is a bad matchup, and I usually only win if I draw Inquisitions and Feed the Clans. Those are both cast well before Days Undoing. Me getting to cast those, and potentially find more of them with a fresh grip while my opponent is tapped out on turn three seems pretty good to me.  I don't think this card is very good. It's a great and pwoerful affect, but I don't know if it has a home in either of these decks. Delver seems like a better fit to me.  As for the price, we're just going to have to wait and see. I think it's going to need to be good in Standard for it to hit $30+. People also seem to be much more exciting about Origins than any other Core set in recent memory as well. This could lead to more sealed product being opened which would drive the price down a fair bit."
mtgmarketwatch,3cnqk3,jball_2k,2,Thu Jul 9 10:51:11 2015 UTC,"I don't like it in Affinity as much after thinking about it. They refill their hand (let's say turn 3) but still don't cast anything until their next turn, and if they cast creatures then they aren't attacking until turn 5.   As a BGx player, that's two turns (turn 3 and turn 4) to regroup and cast freshly drawn removal or blockers. The worst they can do is drop their hand and Plate up on turn 4, which is pretty bad, but expected.   With burn on the other hand, I doubt they'll play it on turn 3, but they will be keeping up the damage immediately once they untap.   I think UR Burn Delver can play well with it, and we could see some saucy brews with Disrupting Shoal to take advantage of the card glut and protect Delver or Swiftspear. It won't play like Cruise, but your first Days Undoing will probably find your next Days Undoing, meaning lots of constant fuel.  Maybe a Monastery Mentor deck, using both Disrupting and Shining Shoal?    Regardless, I don't see an immediate, game changing impact in existing decks unless UR Cruise Burn resurfaces quickly. I think the card will drop in the meantime until it makes a splash in a big tournament. The Pros won't go anywhere near it for Pro Tour Origins, they don't like change.  (Assuming PTO has a modern portion).  I also don't really see it in Standard at all. They aren't equipped to abuse it. Treasure Cruise wasn't even banned. It might get played but with the constant complaints about lack of good control I doubt anything significant will surface with Days Undoing."
mtgmarketwatch,3cnqk3,thepeter,3,Thu Jul 9 13:09:15 2015 UTC,"Whether or not Day's Undoing sees play in Affinity shells is whether or not it's worth the dead draw later for the potential turn 1 of land, Memnite, Ornithopter, Springleaf, Mox, Mox, Days Undoing."
mtgmarketwatch,3cnqk3,ahalavais,3,Thu Jul 9 13:50:57 2015 UTC,"The reason it's potentially good in Affinity is you're probably drawing 3+ cards more than your opponent, and you do it on your second main phase after you attack. If you're playing against BGx, they probably spent their first two turns playing a couple lands and casting one or two spells. They probably have 5+ cards in their hand. If you play it on turn 3 with 2 cards in your hand, you're drawing 5 and they're drawing 2, and while the argument of ""what if they draw removal?"" is real, they probably have good cards in their hand already, it's not like you're trading their 5 land hand for a bunch of removal in most cases.   It's also very good against Tarmogoyf, which can be problematic."

mtgmarketwatch,3cnqk3,Little_Gray,2,Thu Jul 9 12:47:41 2015 UTC,"I believe a mythic has to be playable in standard to hold a $10+ price tag while in print. I can't think of any exceptions, though right now I can't think of any comparable examples of Eternal only mythics either. Past In Flames is the closest I can get, but it was only a 2 of.   Also this is not the kind of card they print anymore if they believe it will be in a top tier standard deck.  Edit: Just to be clear, $30 for this card is insane.   Edit2: Keranos? But it was in a third set and spiked from 10 to 30 in less than a week, and went downhill from there.   Monastery Mentor is probably the best comparison. It was popular in vintage soon after release while not played much in Standard. Though it is not from a large set, so keep that in mind."

mtgmarketwatch,3cmz8m,wintermute93,2,Thu Jul 9 14:38:00 2015 UTC,When Disrupting Shoal foils went MIA I went to ABU to get a few reasonably priced ones. Somewhere between pre-spike and post-spike prices. They quickly shipped without issue.
mtgmarketwatch,3cmz8m,NET_1,2,Thu Jul 9 20:08:20 2015 UTC,It is because the spike is not caused by actual demand.  They were caused by an item being low in stock on TCG and somebody buying it out and relisting at a much higher price.
mtgmarketwatch,3cmz8m,Little_Gray,2,Sat Jul 11 16:52:33 2015 UTC,abugames is on mtgprice as well as other aggregate sites. All you have to do is search through one of those and you'll see if they have it in stock and at what price. I personally don't buy from them because they never offer me any special deals. They limit how many you can buy by keeping low stock and their free shipping is something like min. $150?

Also, K_bonez replied to me when he meant to reply to you, idk if you want to respond.

mtgmarketwatch,3cmz8m,desymond,2,Thu Jul 9 15:11:51 2015 UTC,"That may be true, but I also think they don't list their entire stock to hedge against buyouts."
mtgmarketwatch,3cmz8m,BenBleiweiss,5,Thu Jul 9 15:55:31 2015 UTC,"I'd say that your revision above is more close to reality - we will list X cards at a price, and if they sell out, we may restock Y cards at a higher price, if the market is in flux.  In general though, it's bad business to be showing out of stock on anything. If we're showing out of stock, it usually means that A) we're out of stock, or B) the people responsible for restocking just haven't gotten around to it yet."
mtgmarketwatch,3cmz8m,Shitposters,0,Thu Jul 9 18:29:31 2015 UTC,"When things spike it seems a lot more logical to have it in-stock for an inflated price on the off chance it sells, rather than have it out of stock during the days there is the most demand for it and restock it later, yet I have people that tell me they think scg does shit like lower the price and de-list stock so ""they can buy all the copies for cheaper"""
mtgmarketwatch,3cmz8m,Little_Gray,0,Thu Jul 9 19:09:42 2015 UTC,Its not that they lower their prices its that they do not update prices on out of stock items.  They are getting much better at doing that but they tend to wait until the market has stabilized.    They dont need to lower the price or de-list to buy all the copies for cheaper since they go off their buylist prices.
mtgmarketwatch,3cmz8m,k_bonez,4,Sat Jul 11 16:59:58 2015 UTC,"Ben, SCG lists all their stock in their store at all times? It seems like you guys get awful low on cards really quickly for being one of the largest retailers. It seems like it would make sense to hold back some part of your stock to prevent runs at a certain price. One thing I seem to have noticed from ChannelFireball: buy all listed stock of a card at NM, and immediately they relist one copy at a higher price on Ebay, but not in their store. I have seen this happen a few times."
mtgmarketwatch,3cmz8m,Silvermagi,3,Thu Jul 9 13:04:04 2015 UTC,Its not really smart for any store to list all their stock at once. I wouldn't blame anyone for this. Abu has actually been known for restricting how much one person can buy of stock by holding back and listing at same price later. so not just one person buys it all.
mtgmarketwatch,3cmz8m,k_bonez,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:18:08 2015 UTC,"I agree, but I have consistently seen stock relisted at higher prices as I remarked in the comment above. Doesn't holding back stock in this way amount to speculating?"
mtgmarketwatch,3cmz8m,desymond,3,Thu Jul 9 13:23:35 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. I think it's just a safeguard against 'losing' your entire inventory during a spike. I'm sure they have it setup so if they sell a certain quantity of a card in a time period an alert tells them they need to restock the online store, during which time they can check to see if a spike is occurring and if they need to change prices. No reason not to sell at a higher price if you can."
mtgmarketwatch,3cmz8m,worldchrisis,3,Thu Jul 9 14:04:39 2015 UTC,Most internet stores that also sell in person don't list their entire inventory online because they want to have cards to sell at real life events.
mtgmarketwatch,3cmz8m,Shitposters,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:56:18 2015 UTC,"AFAIK the only times SCG doesn't list all their stock is when they haul it to events.  They want to sell cards, they're not going to pull stock and wait and see where the price will end up - if they're worried about it selling for too cheap they'll just hike the price right up, and lower it if they have to. There's literally no reason to pull their stock."

There are certainly people who want the judge promo instead of the pack foil, but the existence of a cheaper foil option will hinder growth potential of the judge foil.  Then again, it could very well be a similar disparity between Elesh Norn pack foils and the phyrexian-language judge promo. Don't get me wrong, I think the language gimmick is cool.

mtgmarketwatch,3ckxn7,earthbinder,2,Wed Jul 8 19:09:35 2015 UTC,"I still see them for ~$355 on eBay, I doubt it will rise that high in this quick a time. Although it will probably be there by the end of the year given this demand."
mtgmarketwatch,3ckxn7,joshtaco,2,Wed Jul 8 19:13:59 2015 UTC,"One of the decent sized non-TCG dealers still lists 12 pld-spld for $399, and 2 nm-m ones for $499."
mtgmarketwatch,3ckxn7,Salad_Thunder,2,Thu Jul 9 03:46:14 2015 UTC,And there it goes.  Up 70% on MTGStocks.
mtgmarketwatch,3ckxn7,tarheelfreak2006,2,Thu Jul 9 14:07:18 2015 UTC,If by nearly identical demand you mean one being three times as popular as the other then sure.  Dredge is nowhere near as popular as MUD is.  Stop talking about Vintage cards as you have no idea what you are talking about.
mtgmarketwatch,3ckxn7,Little_Gray,2,Wed Jul 8 19:39:45 2015 UTC,"Stop talking about Vintage cards as you have no idea what you are talking about.   Quite frankly, this makes you sound like a complete asshole. This does nothing to foster discussion.   As an aside - I won't be surprised at all if this moves quickly. Even at this price, there are market makers (SCG, et al) who can make the market move on Vintage staples with little effort."
mtgmarketwatch,3ckxn7,tigerbreak,10,Thu Jul 9 03:38:14 2015 UTC,"He worded it like an asshole but ""Actually, what you said is false - there is not equal demand so you can't compare it to workshop"" is very, VERY fucking relevent to finance/this thread. Like, extremely relevant seeing as said misinformation is literally the only thing OP brought up. If it's wrong the entire thread is ""dude sais he thinks bazaar should be worth as much as workshop""  If I posted saying ""only a few copies of beta plateau left, i reckon it's got equal demand of underground sea and we can see it hitting 4-5k by the end of the year"" people would tell me to fuck off and downvote the thread."
mtgmarketwatch,3ckxn7,Shitposters,-3,Thu Jul 9 07:16:50 2015 UTC,"You're right that MUD/Workshops is way more prevalent right now, but it's not guaranteed to continue (a ban for Vintage, say for Chalice, could always occur), and I think the observation that Bazaar hasn't jumped yet is a reasonable one. It may not hit $1,000 but it's definitely undervalued right now, at least compared to the rise in Workshop prices."
mtgmarketwatch,3ckxn7,TheTaiga,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:42:40 2015 UTC,Why would Bazaar jump?  Workshop increased in price because it saw an actual increase in demand and its still only a $700 card.  Expecting something that sees 1/3 the amount of play to rise to $500 is crazy.
mtgmarketwatch,3ckxn7,Little_Gray,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:22:33 2015 UTC,"That may be true, but consider that the supply on Bazaar is so low that any slight metagame shift, restricted list update, or major performance could shift demand dramatically - the idea here is that Bazaar is well-positioned to be a gainer, given the meteoric rise in the value of Workshop. Consider the reasonably sudden uptick in Workshop popularity - this doesn't mean Bazaar is a sure bet, but it has a lot more potential than you seem willing to entertain (especially since it's considered by some to be the 'budget' gateway to paper Vintage)."
mtgmarketwatch,3ckxn7,TheTaiga,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:16:45 2015 UTC,But the increase in popularity of MUD makes Bazaar infinitely worse.  We need a down tick in popularity of Workshop for Bazaar to see real demand.  Workshop has also not seen a meteoric rise outside of TCGPlayer.  Its still very easy to find good condition copies in the $600-700 range.     Not saying the card cant go up but its not going to go up because of actual demand for the card.  Its going to go up because of people buying out the card to artificially inflate the price.

mtgmarketwatch,3cflfu,Smiley059212,10,Tue Jul 7 15:09:34 2015 UTC,"I bought a box of RTR for $80 towards the end of its print run thinking it would double up in a couple of years.   You can get a box of RTR on ebay for $90 right now.   Yes sealed product appreciates, but the rate is so slow for recent sets because of how much of it was printed."
mtgmarketwatch,3cflfu,worldchrisis,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:15:16 2015 UTC,"The reverse of this though, innistrad boxes go for $270+"
mtgmarketwatch,3cflfu,rush8946,2,Wed Jul 8 14:45:47 2015 UTC,Liliana and Snapcaster are a hell of a couple of cards. Also Innistrad was printed much less than RTR/Theros/KTK.
mtgmarketwatch,3cflfu,worldchrisis,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:15:35 2015 UTC,"They are the main drivers there yeah. That and I think a lot of people thoroughly enjoyed the limited experience of innistrad which drives those boxes a little as well. Point stands that there are hits and there are misses to this strategy.  I still think we'll be seeing an RTR price spike soon on all of the cards. The shocks are still severely undervalued for what they are as well as having abrupt decay, deathrite shaman, as well as quite a large number of EDH staples."
mtgmarketwatch,3cflfu,rush8946,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:42:03 2015 UTC,I don't think the shocks are undervalued given the supply and the numbers that get played in each deck. For example Jund only runs 5 shocklands total. Even 2 color decks like UR Twin don't run a full playset of their shock.  Deathrite's modern ban really puts a limit on its price growth.

mtgmarketwatch,3cflfu,PJWalter,7,Wed Jul 8 21:53:47 2015 UTC,Sealed product is a pain in the ass.  Minus a few exceptions it appreciates extremely slowly and is very hard and expensive to move.
mtgmarketwatch,3cflfu,Little_Gray,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:57:24 2015 UTC,"Also, this can happen and end much, much worse."
mtgmarketwatch,3cflfu,OutofStep,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:19:00 2015 UTC,Well yea but that is an extremely rare situation.  You dont normally run into people committing multiple counts of fraud.
mtgmarketwatch,3cflfu,Little_Gray,5,Wed Jul 8 12:58:23 2015 UTC,"A) Sealed product is the equivalent of a bond.  It will appreciate but will do so slowly and requires you to not touch it for a while.  It's money you don't have access to for a bit.  B) Sealed product does better when it is a well liked drafting set (see Innistrad) or when there are cards in the set that are worth a great deal (see Worldwake).  C) Khans was a liked draft set AND features fetch lands, which both point towards it being a good investment, especially if you can sock away boxes at less than $90 and sit on them for a few years.  It was very heavily printed and opened, so the real question is are you okay not touching them if it takes 3-5 years for them to see significant movement?"
mtgmarketwatch,3cflfu,modokmoproblems,3,Tue Jul 7 17:01:39 2015 UTC,"I agree with all this. The other things I'd add are 1) boxes can potentially tie up a lot of capital, so if you are working with a more limited budget, you may lose out on potential gains, and 2) if you draft, the potential downsides of sealed product are partially mitigated (if my box of Theros only goes up to $150 in three years, I can just hold a Theros draft and I'll be perfectly happy)."
mtgmarketwatch,3cflfu,deadwings112,2,Tue Jul 7 17:38:32 2015 UTC,"Yes. This.  Boxes are a near guarantee in two things: 1) Profit, and 2) A multi-year wait.    If $80 is just a fraction of your mtg finance budget then it shouldn't be a big thing to throw it in a closet and forget.    If your resources are a little more limited it may be better to invest in singles which give you the chance to have a variety of long term and short term holds and doesn't tie you up for years in one thing."
mtgmarketwatch,3cflfu,modokmoproblems,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:30:15 2015 UTC,"Lol sorry to burst your bubble, but that box of Theros won't be even be close to worth $150 in 3 years."
mtgmarketwatch,3cflfu,KangaRod,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:34:48 2015 UTC,"I don't know why you got downvoted for this. Comparing Theros to a set like RTR or KTK, and Theros looks downright anemic. The draft format was ass. The gods are cool, but only Xenagod sees competitive play (in a fringe tooth 'n nail deck). If RTR can't clear $90, Theros has very little chance of hitting $150, even in 5 years."
mtgmarketwatch,3cflfu,Rock-swarm,0,Wed Jul 8 19:56:08 2015 UTC,Lol my thoughts exactly
mtgmarketwatch,3cflfu,KangaRod,2,Wed Jul 8 21:20:17 2015 UTC,"I agree as well, however.  If you are wondering if it has any potential to be similar to ZEN because of fetches, I think there are many things going against KoT.  A. No full art land B. ZEN is currently the only way you can get enemy fetches where KoT is the reprint. C. KoT was opened way more. D. There were hidden treasures in ZEN  I can definitely see the increase and demand years later, but Kot will never come close to ZEN based on fetches alone."
mtgmarketwatch,3cflfu,earthbinder,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:42:12 2015 UTC,absolutely agree with point #1 - the fact that each box has 36 guaranteed MINT full art lands (plus 1-2 foils) adds a huge amount of value to a Zendikar box.
mtgmarketwatch,3cflfu,mtg_monkey,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:42:54 2015 UTC,Very few of the boxes sold today have hidden treasures. Hidden treasures was only for the initial print run.
mtgmarketwatch,3cflfu,paulx441,0,Wed Jul 8 02:42:22 2015 UTC,And that print run was famously out-of-stock after 2 months. It's still a decent placebo boost to the market price of a sealed ZEN booster box to the uninformed buyer.

mtgmarketwatch,3cflfu,DFGdanger,2,Tue Jul 7 19:36:49 2015 UTC,Depends entirely on how much you bought it for and how long you wait.

The cat is out of the bag with sealed product.  It appears that the best your investment will do is grow with the index of the singles contained.  If you can just pick the good singles instead , you would do better than the increase from sealed product.    It just makes sense to me.  Waiting for theros to go up?

mtgmarketwatch,3cflfu,Tharen101,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:48:34 2015 UTC,"Ha, its true! You should buy singles you want to play with or product you want to crack. There is some potential for making money off of speculating on singles but most of your profit is going to get eaten away in fees and shipping. Really, if you want a good return on your money you should invest it. It takes forever for a box to appreciate, it often isnt going to do much more than keep up with inflation and if you lose it, or get weak willed and crack it, or damage it the poof... gone. Invasion booster boxes are going for around 300 bucks on Ebay that means that you wait fifteen years to make 225 dollars if it follows a similar trend. There are other boxes that will do better and there are others that could do worse. ITs just not worth it"

mtgmarketwatch,3cd77l,math_ninja,7,Tue Jul 7 00:14:42 2015 UTC,my ranking goes: sdcc>pack foil>promo>regular. I'm not a fan of the date stamp unless I open it myself.
mtgmarketwatch,3cd77l,jimini-christmas,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:42:49 2015 UTC,"The pricing between promo and pack foil is straight-up schizophrenic for recent sets. Promo Tasigur is less than pack foil Tasigur, but Promo Rhino is more than pack foil Rhino. In most cases, they are within 10% of each other in terms of price points. if anything, it indicates that players are indifferent about the date stamp as a whole."
mtgmarketwatch,3cd77l,Rock-swarm,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:24:14 2015 UTC,"That also has to do with demand. You really only need 2 Tasigurs while most decks that play Rhino play all 4, and you don't want mismatched foils, that's just ugly."
mtgmarketwatch,3cd77l,BlaqDove,2,Wed Jul 8 18:10:28 2015 UTC,"$50?  I only say this, because of what SDCC walkers hold at, as well as what blue-Ugin goes for. I feel like it'd be a reasonable price. Although, now that i think about it, I have never looked into foil walker prices, so take what i say with a grain of salt.  Prices on the promo's will also be effected by their relativity to the standard format, or any others. I think pack foils will still hold a higher value unless it's new art, some people don't like the stamp (refer to wurmcoil pre-release)"
mtgmarketwatch,3cd77l,Astockwell,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:38:58 2015 UTC,"Probably not that high, unless they get played a bunch. All those other things were rarer than these, which are probably going to be opened in like 1/8 or 1/10 prerelease packs."
mtgmarketwatch,3cd77l,5-s,2,Wed Jul 8 20:52:59 2015 UTC,"I think these compete with the SDCC cards, and will actually lower the prices of both.  They similar to the Ugin promo, but a little different.  They're going to be a bit more common, and there are 5 of them to spread the value around.    The only other cards I think we can relate this to  Wurmcoil Engine and Emrakul promo prints.  Also, a lot of people really dislike the foil stamp.  Having said that, I think their prices will mirror pack foil prices just like the last few sets of promos, and go up based on play in tournaments."
mtgmarketwatch,3cd77l,Lollipopsaur,2,Tue Jul 7 22:35:42 2015 UTC,"Also, a lot of people really dislike the foil stamp.   Pricing would disagree with this statement. TCGplayer pricing has pack foils and promo foils of multi-format staples like tasigur, rhino, and DTT within 10% of each other's price. If anything, players are indifferent to the date stamp."
mtgmarketwatch,3cd77l,Rock-swarm,2,Wed Jul 8 12:27:24 2015 UTC,It will hover around the same price as the pack foil just like every other one has.
mtgmarketwatch,3cd77l,Little_Gray,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:36:36 2015 UTC,"I think the SDCC ones will probably hurt the price.  If I was looking to put one in a cube, not sure which I'd prefer."

Wizards has to keep packs flying off the shelves, not supplemental product! Here's a graph, showing player-acceptance versus modern prices.  Just buy everything in modern"
mtgmarketwatch,3cbi68,jcmtg,7,Mon Jul 6 20:28:07 2015 UTC,"I'm going to make a ton of assumptions and bold claims.  I haven't checked for fallacies, and I haven't proofed the logic. please call me out if I'm wrong, it helps the conversation    Claim 1.  The fair market price of a deck is independent from the fair market price of the cards in the deck.    Conversely, the fair market price of cards is dependent of the fair market price of the decks it's in.    Before Modern Masters 2015 an affinity deck cost approximately $625.64.    Post Modern Masters 2015 (or during spoiler season) the price of 9 cards have changed significantly. Blinkmoth Nexus went from 12 to 6, lowering the price of the deck by 24 dollars. Cranial Plating went from 2.25 to 1, lowering the price by 5 dollars. Etched Champion went from 7 to 3.5, lowering the price by 14 dollars. Mox Opal went from 60 to 37, lowering the price by 92 dollars. Spellskite went from 25 to 22, lowering the price by 6 dollars (it's a 2-of).    conversely, Inkmoth went from 13 to 25, raising the price by 48 dollars. Glimmervoid went from 10 to 20, raising the price by 40 dollars. blood moon went from 25 to 50, raising the price by 50 dollars (it's a 2-of). ravager went from 20 to 45, raising the price by 100 dollars this one is mid spike, take at a grain of salt.    Those changes brought the post Modern Masters price of the deck to 722.64, which is an increase of 15.4 percent.  The amount of increase should be very similar to the percent increase in Modern player base due to Modern Masters 2015 + natural growth over the time covered.  I'd put natural growth over the 4 months we're talking about at 3%-6% and growth due to modern masters at 10% - 15% bringing the proposed total to an unscientific 13% - 21%.  If we assume the middle of that range, we realize that a growth of 17% should be expected, leaving us with 1.6% more growth to present itself.  The wrench with that theory is that Steel Overseer hasn't had his spike/adjustment yet and Inkmoth looks like it hasn't finished it's climb yet.  If those guys (who have noticeably higher print runs than glimmervoid or ravager) are going to jump another 20%, then Ravager will have to come down 5 dollars to compensate.  At which point he will be free to continue to gain 3 - 6 percent a year.  Tl;Dr:  ravager stabilizes at 40.  Overseer Spikes to 15 then settles at 10, and Inkmoth climbs to 30 before stabilizing.  edit:  cleaned up some formatting"
mtgmarketwatch,3cbi68,Abyssalmole,2,Mon Jul 6 21:28:23 2015 UTC,"this is an excellent post. i have been waiting for someone to put in the effort to this sort of thing, Price of decks over time, knowing i didn't have the time/ability to do it.  I've suggested before to people that Modern hasn't been getting overall more expensive and not got any traction.  Nowadays, where you can get much more utility/use from a Modern deck, of course it should cost more. But i like that this post suggests that it isn't by as much as people think."
mtgmarketwatch,3cbi68,geraintm,2,Tue Jul 7 07:53:32 2015 UTC,This would also explain why a lot of legacy-only staples have stalled in price over the last year. There's simply more people leaving the format than buying in.

It's going to be a while before Modern blows up again, thanks to lack of events and Modern Masters. Now is the time to make some money. Keep what you need to play and keep what you think maybe has further upside, but largely it's time to actually cash in on some profits.

Rather than asking, “When should I sell?"" or ""When do Modern prices begin falling"", it is much more reasonable  and easier on yourself to ask “What is my target sell price?""  Whenever a card reaches either my (buylist or retail) target price, I sit back and re-evaluate by asking these two questions:   How much profit should I lock in now? What are the chances of it going even higher vs. the difficulty in outing it later?   For e.g. You bought into 8 playsets of Chord of Calling at $3.5 and set a target retail price of $9. That price was met by last week.  If you’re conservative like myself, you lock in profits and sell, say 6 playsets and leave 2 playsets for future growth.

Modern speculation hits a few weeks before the first set of the calendar year, and modern prices taper off until the big fall release.  Karn didn't get a jump this year because the reprint was known(but also note that he didn't decrease much at all).

How about some critical thinking here, fellas? Let's say hypothetically that I can sell a card today for a $2 profit or wait 9 months and sell it for a potential profit of somewhere between $5 and $15 (we can't predict the future, but we can make reasonable guesses based on historical trends). Which is the best time to sell out? Well, we STILL don't have enough information because our decision should consider percentage profit margins. $2 profit today on a Snapcaster (~2.5% profit margin) isn't even worth the trouble of the transaction, in MY opinion (another factor to be considered: personal preference, and we're not all identical in preferences). If we can realize a $15 profit per Snapcaster in 9 months, that'll be close to 19% profit margin, but of course you'd have to wait for it and also weather the reprint storm. What is a realistic probability for a Snapcaster reprint in the next 9 months? I'd suggest something in the ballpark of 5% probability of a reprint, which may be very generous (it might end up in Commander 2015 but I doubt it).  This rambling comment is intended to share some of the thought patterns we ought to be considering. I recognize my thoughts could be better communicated and perhaps could be a lot more orderly, but the bottom line is this: please think more. Consider more variables than ""can I profit today? SELL!"""

And actually, I'm pretty sure Horizon Canopy was actually spiking prior to Burnwillows. Elves and Melira were already starting to drive the price up, and then the new hotness of Naya Zoo really put gas on the spike.  Bogles is getting some hype attention again due to the potential mulligan rule change."
mtgmarketwatch,3c2qiw,Trent_Alkaline,3,Sat Jul 4 19:42:50 2015 UTC,"I can't imagine this price being sustainable. Unlike Grove of the Burnwillows, which is a four-of in Punishing Jund and Lands in Legacy as well as RG Tron in modern, Horizon Canopy is usually a one-of in any GWx deck that can support it. Even with Grove being in a supplemental product, I don't think Canopy can sustain the kind of prices Grove can."
mtgmarketwatch,3c2qiw,Valdarith,3,Sat Jul 4 13:34:25 2015 UTC,"I agree that I doubt it'll match Grove due to Legacy demand for it, but 4 major Modern tier 2 decks have hype rolling hard, and many are actually running Horizon as at least a 2-of, if not 3-4 (Bogles, Zoo both appear to be running 4--Elves, Melira run 2-3).  Elves is talking about ditching Elvish Visionaries (or at least dropping it down from a 4-of) with Dwynen's Elite coming and needs the cantrip power of Canopy.  Given that those are all very hyped decks right now, and many appear to have cemented their places as very solid performers (tier 2 decks), I think we will see Horizon ride $70+ until reprint simply due to scarcity in the face of demand."
mtgmarketwatch,3c2qiw,Trent_Alkaline,2,Sat Jul 4 19:48:51 2015 UTC,One thing worth mentioning is that it IS seeing some legacy play in Maverick as a 1-of and has even been showing up as 2-of in Death and Taxes lists.

Given the larger playerbase, and the increased awareness of card value, I have to imagine full-art foils would actually start out above $4.

mtgmarketwatch,3bw049,bunbunfriedrice,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:48:01 2015 UTC,"I'm in on the foils.  They are original printing pack foils and have much more price insulation.  If it gets a reprint in any way shape or form there will be a new 'cheapest copy', but the original printing pack foil will still be the 'pimp' version."
mtgmarketwatch,3bw049,bfro,-4,Fri Jul 3 05:46:56 2015 UTC,Its not a card I would want to be picking up or holding onto more then I need.  While the FNM promo wont do much to the price the card is going to get a reprint eventually and when it does it will be worthless.    Hold on to them if you are using them and stay away from them as a spec.  The FNM promo is probably worth picking up even if the art turns off a lot of people.
mtgmarketwatch,3bw049,Little_Gray,-6,Thu Jul 2 19:15:52 2015 UTC,"I have a total hunch it might be spoiled for Origins soon. Scry being evergreen, FNM promo..."

mtgmarketwatch,3bvdzl,CmSrN,8,Thu Jul 2 13:40:44 2015 UTC,I have felt like it was safe too. It was auto banned at the inception of modern. So may have a chance. Also sees legacy play.
mtgmarketwatch,3bvdzl,Silvermagi,7,Thu Jul 2 14:10:24 2015 UTC,"I think it's probably safe, but being a safe unban doesn't really lead me to believe in will be unbanned.  There are still a bunch of auto-bans that have been on the list forever.  Grave-Troll turned out to be a perfectly safe unban, but spent years on the banned list."
mtgmarketwatch,3bvdzl,Krond,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:40:52 2015 UTC,"but this auto bans need to be unbanned and tested some day... i guess they just cant ban something forever... as the game evolves, things get diferent and cards get weaker and other get more powerfull..."
mtgmarketwatch,3bvdzl,joshtaco,0,Thu Jul 2 16:48:57 2015 UTC,"well, i think the meta is as aggro as it can be. barely seing control now... and its sad, i really like to play against control (as a G/r Tron player xD) and lets face it, control never gets to keep his new toys since JtMs... everything is banned and keeps behing banned... they could give control one of his old toys back xD"

mtgmarketwatch,3bvdzl,TheTaiga,2,Thu Jul 2 17:19:54 2015 UTC,"Would not be surprised to see this go into a deck with Twin, similar to how it was paired with DD before. I think this card is mostly fine in Modern and could be unbanned. That said, I think they're happy with the current state of modern so maybe no changes."
mtgmarketwatch,3bvdzl,paulx441,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:20:14 2015 UTC,"It could, but it doesn't operate on a different axis than Twin, so I'm not sure that it offers much value - consider that many of the same hosers are good against both combos (for example, -1/-1 effects such as Illness in the Ranks or Night of Soul's Betrayal, Enchantment/Artifact removal, and most notably Abrupt Decay). I think it's actually best in a strict Esper control deck, u/w gifts tron, or Tezzerator, none of which I'm worried about suddenly being dominant."
mtgmarketwatch,3bvdzl,Rockenos,2,Thu Jul 2 17:35:25 2015 UTC,"I feel like this is either going to go the way of BBE (lots of hype, pre announcement spike, then nothing because it's not unbanned) or Grave Troll (unbanned and nothing)"
mtgmarketwatch,3bvdzl,Rock-swarm,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:53:31 2015 UTC,"What do you mean, unbanned an nothing? Grave Troll went from a $1 card to a $10 card. It's now $5, but still a lot more than $1."
mtgmarketwatch,3bvdzl,Little_Gray,2,Thu Jul 2 20:22:35 2015 UTC,"More to the point, there are plenty of shells in which the thopter/sword combo becomes the premier win-condition while streamlining the deck.  However, I feel that the existence of Ensnaring Bridge actually prohibits the unbanning of SotM. The sword combo is already a very powerful board state, but Bridge also lets you crack in for damage on your turn with 1 card in hand, then play out that card and revert to a lock-down board state."
mtgmarketwatch,3bvdzl,Little_Gray,2,Fri Jul 3 17:02:29 2015 UTC,Yea its a safe unban.  I have been saying it for awhile but I dont know if they want to go that rout.  It might make actual control playable which seems to be something that dont want.     Only issue is that foils are already $20.
mtgmarketwatch,3busbv,owen349,10,Thu Jul 2 09:17:23 2015 UTC,What you mean only 25 remain? Each version has over 150 copies available on TCG. This card is going nowhere.

Modern season is at or just past its peak, and I expect to see a slow decline once it ends. Even if it spikes up to $40, it's not high enough to make much off and if you want it to play in the future I think there's a reasonable chance it drops down to $25 in 8-10 months."

mtgmarketwatch,3bpcxr,Wooberg,2,Wed Jul 1 05:17:46 2015 UTC,I think Hatebears appears just slightly less than Bogles and definitely uses them as well. But the point stands that it's a card that only really shows up in fringe decks. Which is something that really makes this spike interesting.

mtgmarketwatch,3bpcxr,jjness,3,Wed Jul 1 13:29:07 2015 UTC,I was under the impression that Modern D&T was Hatebears. Mostly because Hatebears is largely an umbrella term for decks that use small creatures to dick around with what your opponent can do.

mtgmarketwatch,3bpcxr,Little_Gray,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:08:42 2015 UTC,"Sure, it has been, but a GP top 8 does wonders for increasing a deck's visibility and interest of the deck in the player base."

mtgmarketwatch,3bpcxr,echomtg-com,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:00:12 2015 UTC,I think people are going after Future Sight cards given their scarceness. Horizon Canopy is up to 75 and Grove of the Burnwillows above 50
mtgmarketwatch,3bpcxr,Bluebruin,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:25:47 2015 UTC,"It seems likely to stick. Of the Future Sight duals, Grove and Canopy were intended to be part of cycles that would likely be too powerful for standard and possibly modern (a U/R Grove land would be very much overpowered for pretty much any format). Maze and River cycles would be totally fine and the filter cycle already happened, so in my opinion it's hard to envision Grove or Canopy reprints anytime soon.   This is all speculation on my part of course, but there's plenty of design space left for land cycles so outside of a supplemental product I have a hard time seeing Grove/Canopy reprints."

mtgmarketwatch,3blc3c,TheZeph,1 point,Tue Jun 30 09:40:39 2015 UTC,Does anyone know when these will be available on the Hasbro website?
mtgmarketwatch,3blc3c,The_Last_Raven,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:29:02 2015 UTC,Usually they do it after the con.
mtgmarketwatch,3blc3c,bmemike,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:31:32 2015 UTC,And they're gone within seconds - with many people having them in the cart while they sell out.
mtgmarketwatch,3blc3c,The_Last_Raven,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:30:43 2015 UTC,"Yep... At the con, it's a frenzy. I'm not sure what the print run will be like, but it's a trend for things to become less exclusive. It used to be there were a lot more real con exclusives, but now there always seem to be ""extra""."
mtgmarketwatch,3blc3c,Kominyetska,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:09:56 2015 UTC,SDCC 2014 was July 24-27 and the cards appeared on the Hasbro site on August 4th around 8am PST last year. That should give you an idea of timing.
mtgmarketwatch,3blc3c,Lollipopsaur,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:17:31 2015 UTC,"These were available even on the last day of Comic-Con last year.  Hasbro managed printing more, and allocating a limit per day better than in 2013.  I'd expect these to settle about the same as last year.    But just like everything, if one of these cards is actually good in multiple formats, the price will reflect that."
mtgmarketwatch,3blc3c,Little_Gray,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:45:10 2015 UTC,I expect it to be less then the 2014 one.  There were considerably more of 2014 printed then 2013 and I see no reason why they wont print even more this year.
mtgmarketwatch,3blc3c,bmemike,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:13:01 2015 UTC,"It may go for more than the 2014 set simply because of the overlap between 2013 and 2014. This year's set has a high degree of novelty (flipwalkerszomg!), so that may drive prices as well.  But one thing is certain: the price right now and in the week following SDCC will be the highest. If you want one, just wait. It'll come down."
mtgmarketwatch,3blc3c,Kominyetska,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:32:48 2015 UTC,the price is actually not that high since it retails for $120 but can be had for around $350 pre-order
mtgmarketwatch,3blc3c,paulx441,1 point,Wed Jul 1 07:17:56 2015 UTC,Is the retail price announced? It was higher last year (compared to 2013) because of the damn foam axe (that you had to buy... grumble grumble).

mtgmarketwatch,3bil44,LMAOMOBILE,11,Mon Jun 29 14:59:26 2015 UTC,"Standard demand for that card will far exceed its modern demand.  Nearly all red decks in standard consider that card, where only an unproven, fringe modern tribal deck wants rabblemaster(and zoo I guess, maybe)  Its not worth it. Sell out and leave the hype"
mtgmarketwatch,3bil44,Unknown_Phate,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:05:24 2015 UTC,"Exactly this. If you feel like rabbles give you the best shot to win at FNM for the next 3 months, then by all means hold them and hope that eventually they see some modern play.  Otherwise, most of the competitive modern goblins lists are being built very low to the ground, so I doubt rabble ends up making the cut. Not until we get a goblin mana dork at least."
mtgmarketwatch,3bil44,Rock-swarm,3,Mon Jun 29 18:52:44 2015 UTC,"If you want them as a post-rotation spec, I think it is safe to wait until rotation. The standard demand for them is high, and they will very likely drop a bunch at rotation. If you already have a bunch, I might consider selling/trading if you can get close to retail value. Buylist spreads are high (only buylisting for ~$4) meaning that stores probably don't think it is a card they want to be getting stuck with a lot of right now."

I'm actually thinking about keeping them after rotation, it's a really good card and even if it plummets after M15 rotates out, it might go up a bit after"

mtgmarketwatch,3bgh8o,Valdarith,5,Mon Jun 29 00:39:17 2015 UTC,"Right now it seems like demand for the nonblue lands is driven almost completely by the casual crowd   And it will likely stay that way. The blue checklands see play in modern almost exclusively due to choke protection, while the non-blue checklands are a liability against blood moon."
mtgmarketwatch,3bgh8o,Rock-swarm,8,Mon Jun 29 00:54:24 2015 UTC,"Running the first copy of Sulfur Falls is almost a free-roll in U/R twin at least. I would do it even if Choke didn't exist, just to possibly save a point of damage."
mtgmarketwatch,3bgh8o,stravant,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:57:36 2015 UTC,This is most likely the case. That the lands are still steadily increasing in price despite mainly being played in casual circles is a good sign though.  I would keep an eye on Clifftop Retreat if a WR taxes build (or a WR archetype in general) becomes a thing in Modern. WR taxes is already kind of a thing in Legacy (splashing red for Magus of the Moon).

mtgmarketwatch,3bgh8o,Yagoua81,2,Mon Jun 29 02:56:46 2015 UTC,Plus checklands will likely be standard legal at some point in the future so its nice to already have a set.  The same goes for all modern dual lands.

mtgmarketwatch,3bf8yp,paulx441,3,Sun Jun 28 19:38:48 2015 UTC,This is assuming equal amounts of play throughout all of Kamigawa block. Kamigawa was heavily underpowered coming off the Mirrodin block and the game's popularity stagnated if not shrunk during this block. Betrayers and Saviors really hurt the game.
mtgmarketwatch,3bf8yp,paulx441,2,Sun Jun 28 23:05:23 2015 UTC,"You made an error in calculating the Goryo's, its 1 pack then 1 pack for a total of 2 packs, so .036 or just over half the number of Breaches."
mtgmarketwatch,3bf8yp,RideTheIguana,3,Mon Jun 29 00:42:21 2015 UTC,A really quick search on mtgtop8 shows through the breach in twice as many decks.
mtgmarketwatch,3bf8yp,epicmtgplayer,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:02:05 2015 UTC,There is also literally zero good arguments for Through the Breach being a $25 card.
mtgmarketwatch,3bf8yp,Little_Gray,0,Mon Jun 29 00:45:54 2015 UTC,Except it wont stay at that price.  Its continuing to rise from buyouts but once people realise its a shit card in a shit deck it will drop back down.
mtgmarketwatch,3bf8yp,Little_Gray,0,Sun Jun 28 20:49:53 2015 UTC,"One possible reason for the discrepancy: Liquid availability.  Through the Breech has always been a fringe Tier 2 card that people have brewed around in Modern / Extended. On the other hand Goryo's Vengeance hadn't really seen any interest at all until Griselbrand was printed (giving at least 8 high quality reanimation targets when paired with Emrakul).  So, it's possible that a lot more copies of Vengeance are sitting in bulk boxes unavailable for purchase than with Through the Breech."

So far the set doesn't have a good rare land cycle or a lot of obviously pushed cards to soak up the value. Aside from Languish and Goblin Piledriver, most of the powerful cards we've seen so far don't easily slot into existing decks. For example, most of the pushed white cards we've seen spoiled will only be valuable if Origins is enough to make a white weenie deck viable."

Fish wants non-Island sources of Blue to fight through Choke.  Elves really doesn't care too much because beyond turn 2/3 most of your mana production comes from Elves.

mtgmarketwatch,3b8jd5,Manadyne,3,Fri Jun 26 21:54:48 2015 UTC,"I don't think the concern is choke-effects for elves. The new 1GB elf shaman is definitely going into elf CoCo builds - adding black via the palace is pain free in Elf builds. It has advantages over Overgrown Tomb, especially in a format where staying at 20 means you have 133% or more of your opponent's 'starting' life total. Adding a dual land like this frees up life for Thoughtseize, splashes for Abrupt Decay, and opens avenues for other innovations in GB. I think it will be a hit, and while its late now, I'm not surprised these sold out at $3."

If you can find a top 8 red list that has Urd in it, sure, that can vouch for its usefulness. However, even currently Urd is just a gimmicky psuedo pump spell for an FNM deck."
mtgmarketwatch,3b75lv,150crawfish,2,Fri Jun 26 18:36:02 2015 UTC,"You're confusing 2 decks. Hall is better because it's not tribal. They're talking a more dedicated shift to goblins, making the bonus more uniform. Seems fine to me."

There hasn't been a tribal deck that's been worth a damn, we just got several cards in this last set that actually pushed Goblins.    Hall of triumph was a 2 of in the last PT winning 75. Urd is neither proactive or reactive to what you want to do. You tap out most of the time to cast it and are left vulnerable, a place RDW shouldn't be in.   Hall is Legendary and pretty narrow. And you're very rarely going to be tapping out to play Obelisk, unless you're setting up a ridiculous turn 4 play. Most of the time you're still going to have several creatures to attack with. This is why I'm saying you clearly haven't tested it much if at all, because saying you have to tap out your mana for Obelisk and waste a turn not attacking is just absurd."
mtgmarketwatch,3b75lv,floppybeef,4,Fri Jun 26 19:26:28 2015 UTC,"The fact Rabblemaster is rotating out of standard in three months will really put a damper on any potential growth. It's currently just too much of a buyers market right now. Everyone is trying to get out of their Rabblemasters before they rotate down to $2-3 or less. Goblins would have to be oppressively good in standard to reverse Rabblemasters price trajectory.  As for Modern demand, even if Modern Goblins is suddenly tier one now, Eidolon of the Great Revel is a four of in Burn, a Tier1 deck for sure, and only just recently passed $10, being a third set rare too. Kolaghan's Command is basically the next coming if Cryptic Command in modern, and is $8. CoCo is setting modern on fire, is a four of in every non-rock green deck, and is still only ~13.00. This is all to say, even if Rabblemaster is the next big hit in modern, it would likely just stabilize his price.  Of course, some dillweed could drop $2000 buying him out on TCG and who knows when happens then."

Significant price drop for existing copies, followed by the typical release-day price spike and gradual settling of prices based on it's new playability.  A few things to keep in mind.   Vendors will want to get out of their MP/HP copies ASAP. They don't want to be holding onto beat-to-shit copies of a card that's about to get an influx of mint condition supply with the same art. Keep an eye on good ebay and tcg deals for the race to the bottom. If Piledriver takes off in standard (and possibly modern), expect the window for foils to be incredibly small. Like, you need to be the guy that's hounding people at pre-release for foil piledrivers. Otherwise you are likely paying cash money or massive pucapoints for a foil playset."

They are now $16 for a heavy play copy and the high is $25 for near mint. So the anouncement of Pildriver is affecting prices of other Goblin staples for modern. As to Piledriver itself I suspect it will settle at $10, but will come out the gate between $15 and $20."
mtgmarketwatch,3b7bxd,GosuMagic,0,Sat Jun 27 04:24:04 2015 UTC,"tl;dr Down.  Onslaught was a LONG time ago. While I don't don't know the legacy meta, it's a fair assumption that the $15 price is largely due to scarcity. Origins will flood the market with copies. No one has numbers, but it's a safe guess that there will be an order of magnitude more Piledrivers on the market by the fall. Think hundreds of minty new Origins copies for each old Onslaught one.  Currently, Rabblemaster will buoy Piledriver's price for a while as people will want to try goblins in standard. Pre-orders hype will probably settle around $8-10, but could drop to five if demand isn't there, always hard to predict what the stores will do though. MM2015 reprints didn't budge a penny until after release.   Once Piledriver hits the market, he will need to quickly find a home (ideally in standard) to maintain any sort of value. If he does then maybe he holds $4-5. If he doesn't then I would expect trajectories similar to the Rare Sadisi and Rare Anifenza. If Goblin Guide shows up in BFZ that could breath new life into Piledriver, but I would still only expect $3-5 at best. As an example, Tasigur sees quite a bit of play in both Standard and Modern, yet even he settled around $6 due to the massive supply of sets currently in standard."

mtgmarketwatch,3b7fi9,The_Upvote_Beagle,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:49:31 2015 UTC,"I don't think Merfolk will drive up the price; a lot of them only run 1-of, if that. But for sure Elves (99% 4 of's) and potentially Goblins."

I have 12 of these, but I'm pretty sure WOTC will never let a modern land reach such a price :-)  My advice is to sell Cavern, not buy it anymore, the boat shipped.  You can wait for Cavern to reach these 60$ that it should reach in 6 months, but I think this card is also very likely to be reprinted in this time frame. Wait & see ..."

mtgmarketwatch,3b7fi9,RayDonger,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:43:54 2015 UTC,"While this is probably a safe(ish) place to store some value until Modern Masters 201X, it's not much of a spec. Good spec targets are cheap and have the potential for significant growth, for example you could spec on Ojuti's Command because it is ~.80c, most of the other commands have proven themselves in one format or another, and as a buy a box promo, wizards believes it will be a roll player in (presumably) standard.   Cavern on the other hand is a $45 card that has already doubled in price over the last couple months, and only sees play as a 1-2 of. While the number of decks using it has increased recently, so has it's price, and I think most of the decks that want to throw one or two in already have. It may see more slow growth, as additional decks try it out/adapt to the meta, or (like blood moon) we may be post spike and see a flattening/decline. Which is all to say, while you could pick worse cards to store value or hold in the hopes of gains (scalding tarn) you could probably do a lot better (Abrupt Decay, any Spiky MM2015 Mythic, etc).    As always YMMV, the modern market is kinda all over the place right now, but fundamentals still generally hold true."

mtgmarketwatch,3b33vt,Zebo91,12,Thu Jun 25 16:04:44 2015 UTC,"So, there's 2 things happening with this.   Standard players have immediately stopped selling their painlands to retailers, for obvious reasons. This means that existing painland prices might actually increase a tiny bit before Origins hits shelves. Another large influx of painland supply hits the market in roughly a month, meaning whatever gains you accrue on painland value washes away at that time. This also means that buylist opportunities are incredibly bad (as if they weren't already) for this cycle.   So, either trade these painlands away next week, or sit on them for use in standard and hope to Sweet Baby Jesus that you can trade them for value in wintertime when all standard staples are at their peak."
mtgmarketwatch,3b33vt,Rock-swarm,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:34:53 2015 UTC,"Agree.  What do u think are the implications of printing of enemy painlands has on lands in battle for zendikar?   With m15 and knans they went enemy painlands into ally fetches + tri colour lands.    While there may be no rhyme or reason, it is difficult to imagine enemy fetches follows enemy painlands. Allied manlands though would make sense."
mtgmarketwatch,3b33vt,Volition85,9,Fri Jun 26 09:40:21 2015 UTC,"Nope. They will plummet. These lands have been printed many, many, times. They are not  hard to get. And only 2 are used alot in standard (and see no play outside of it). Heck EDH players barely play them. I have stayed away from these and I continue to do so. If they had maybe changed the art? MAYBE they would have spiked."

In my 5 color CoA deck, because I can't afford revised duels, I run all the shocklands, all the painlands, 5 basics, few fetches and 3C land from KTK.   So far, the painlands are a huge backup for when I don't have acces to the colours through my shocklands. Not often do they tap for colored mana, but I thank the lord when they do!"
mtgmarketwatch,3b33vt,HelixR,9,Fri Jun 26 10:48:56 2015 UTC,You think the price will go up as supply is added?
mtgmarketwatch,3b33vt,CorpT,2,Thu Jun 25 16:12:21 2015 UTC,"It happens all the time.  The price was going down because of rotation, now that they are not rotating the price will start to rebound.  They will most likely hover around the $4-5 range."
mtgmarketwatch,3b33vt,Little_Gray,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:34:15 2015 UTC,"The price may go up because the fact that they'll be usable in the next standard makes them more-desirable.

mtgmarketwatch,3b33vt,mtg_liebestod,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:59:14 2015 UTC,"If no other lands are printed in this set, it will leave tri lands, gainlands, pain, qnd fetches as the scry will drop off. So demand should go up for them at least temporarily since many people have already traded away the painlands since they expected a price drop due to rotation. Plus with a new set people will want to try new decks since they are doing more than just allied colors in this set. So demand should go up before rotation theoretically with supply. Right?"

He's absolutely a card that can only go up, given the factors you mentioned in your post. I will definitely say it'll be a slow roller, but it'll get higher over time."

The only reason I wouldn't go in on it is because of barrier to entry because it's already $20; definitely a card I'd want a playset of though.  The fact that dragons maze was so terrible seems like a plus for voice, as people won't be hoarding boxes of dragons maze to ever open.  Currently buylists to a few stores for $16+ - CK offers 21.50 store credit and I've picked up a handful of voices for 18, and see some around the net for 20 still. Very low difference in buylist and sale price tells me it's a solid spec and while the investment is high you're not taking a huge risk."

Too many people hold onto former standard staples because they weren't able to ""cash out"" at a price where they bought into the card. This isn't exactly logical, it's simply loss aversion.

mtgmarketwatch,3azi9v,desymond,2,Thu Jun 25 04:23:39 2015 UTC,Sure but you should know that you don't play that tower. Absolutely novice level mistake. You can still play pro level with different arts.

I think the issue is that any that is going to be treated with suspicion, due to the assumption that everyone is self interested.  The problem is in interpreting what self interest is at play.  Are they after magic pointless karma? Do they have 200 copies? Are they trying to get the respect of their peers? Are they genuinely selfless and like it as an intellectual exercise?

Or is 1 more expensive but does far, far more than the Cage.  If they made a card that cost (1)(PhyrexianW) that was the same as Rest in Piece it'd pretty much replace Grafdiggers and Rest in Peace, especially if it had an extra effect of some kind.  If they made a modal instant/sorcery card of options like Rakdos Charm, except with more power creep, it'll replace old graveyard hate since it can be played with Snapcaster and triggers Prowess/piles up cards for Delve.  A creature with an ETB or static effect, similar to Containment Priest would make waves Legacy sideboards with Aether Vial in any hatebears deck. A 2 mana 2/2 that stops all cards being played if not cast, and stops cards being cast from the graveyard?  Graveyard hate keeps getting printed and it will keep getting printed better and better.  Grafdigger's cage doesn't stop creatures cheated via the hand, so it has no purpose vs Sneak & Show.  Grafdigger's cage has a lot of weaknesses, and it wouldn't take much to make it completely redundant. Especially as Artifact hate like Destructive Revelry gets better and better.

It's not some coordinated conspiracy by evil mustache-twirling speculators.  The nice thing about this particular card is that it's completely unnecessary for the deck.  The only reason to run it is because it's a nonbasic land that taps for blue on turn 1, isn't locked down by Choke or destroyed by Boil, and doesn't damage you when tapped. That's an incredibly narrow range, and you could easily replace it with shock lands, Scars fastlands, or painlands to get roughly the same effect."

mtgmarketwatch,3arljr,Demilio55,2,Wed Jun 24 12:36:38 2015 UTC,it's for [[Choke]].  You pay a premium for ETB tapped versus untapped. Plus if you're frisky you can actually try out white cards like Stony Silence and kataki for the Affinity matchup which is horrible.
mtgmarketwatch,3arljr,jcmtg,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:22:15 2015 UTC,I'm well aware.  Seachrome does the same job and is now cheaper.  I wonder why those lists didn't run a playset of Cavern though?
mtgmarketwatch,3arljr,Demilio55,2,Wed Jun 24 15:31:24 2015 UTC,"Merfolk already runs at least 4 mutavault and sometimes includes others colorless lands like ghost quarter and tectonic edge in the main. Once you include 2 cavern of souls in there it already makes it awkwardly hard to cast non-merfolk creature spells like remand, kira, great glass spinner, vapor snag, spell snare, spell pierce, etc. The deck doesn't run a ton of them, but running any more caverns make it really difficult to consistently cast the few that are there. That, and two often proves to be enough.  This is all for modern though. I've seen some legacy lists running 4 caverns, I assume just because of daze and force."

I'm not sure there is a shell that can compete with the current modern format yet, but there is potential. You try out stuff like Nameless Inversion, enhancing the mana base, or newer stuff like Linger Souls. Who knows what'll work best."
mtgmarketwatch,3aswgm,BelcherSucks,1 point,Tue Jun 23 06:37:44 2015 UTC,So their current playability seems quite low. Is this a poor investment in your eyes? Just looking for some opinions.
mtgmarketwatch,3aswgm,Encendi,3,Tue Jun 23 06:43:23 2015 UTC,"If you're looking for investments pay attention to format staples rather than hoping for little known cards to spike up (as they tend to come crashing straight back down).   A lot of people said Snapcaster couldn't get above $50 a few months ago, but there he is... I imagine it wouldn't be hard to find similar undervalued staples (shocks, cough cough)."
mtgmarketwatch,3aswgm,Encendi,1 point,Tue Jun 23 06:57:20 2015 UTC,Are you looking at the old art shocks or the newer ones?
mtgmarketwatch,3aswgm,paulx441,3,Tue Jun 23 07:02:57 2015 UTC,"Personally I've put a decent chunk of money into foil RTR/GTC shocks. However, this was for a deck so whether or not they go up is irrelevant- I don't like investing in stuff for money; I like my cards to be used. Thus perhaps I didn't do my due diligence as I would for a purer investment.   However, on the surface they seem like a decent bet. Stagnant for years, not to mention foil fetches are $60-80 so they could easily reach that amount. Would probably take a concerted buyout or a large store to make a really huge jump though."
mtgmarketwatch,3aswgm,rush8946,2,Tue Jun 23 07:05:54 2015 UTC,Shocks are rarely a 4 of in any deck in any format right now though. Almost every deck runs a playset of a fetchland plus some random other ones in every format.
mtgmarketwatch,3aswgm,jambarama,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:39:16 2015 UTC,The fetches do see a lot more play than the shocks do however. They see play in Legacy and Vintage where shocks don't have a home. I think this is a lot of the reason why the fetches are so much higher than the shocks. I would honestly be dumping more money into fetches right now than any shocklands.
mtgmarketwatch,3aswgm,Encendi,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:27:21 2015 UTC,"Not only do fetches see play in more formats, you play more of them even in modern.  Look at just about any modern deck. Jund & junk  runs ~8ish fetches and 2-3 shocks. Infect, twin, and burn are all  similar.    You don't want too many shocks because they deal damage to you, you.  Just enough to fetch and fix your mana base - support a splash or secondary color."
mtgmarketwatch,3aswgm,epicmtgplayer,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:57:41 2015 UTC,"I agree that fetches do see significantly more play. However, I disagree in that Legacy and Vintage have very negligible impact on card values. You can point to Legacy staples like TNN, Containment Priest, and DRS as counterarguments but I have a feeling the price of Legacy cards is more tied to stores trying to milk Legacy players' (rather large) wallets than actual demand.   I also think that RTR was opened considerably less than KTK, although I have no way to verify this."
mtgmarketwatch,3aswgm,Little_Gray,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:23:47 2015 UTC,"I'm focusing on RTR/GTC for easiness to sell.  Even if there's a bit more money in old art ones I imagine both will rise together, and selling cheaper cards locally is far easier - if you sell on ebay or whatever then by all means go for old ones. Not many people want to buy a card for $5 more than what they can get the same effect for."
mtgmarketwatch,3aswgm,BelcherSucks,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:27:45 2015 UTC,Yea looking at staples in the best way to go.  Six months ago I literally could not sell a playset of snaps for $100.
mtgmarketwatch,3aswgm,andrewriker,2,Tue Jun 23 14:30:43 2015 UTC,They are cool cards but they don't currently have a home. If you wanna grab a playset of them to brew with then. It's like 5-8 bux if you wanna get 1 of each.
mtgmarketwatch,3aswgm,atheistpiece,1 point,Tue Jun 23 06:56:37 2015 UTC,"Neither create any sort of onbaord advantage, or help towards an endgame. Sickening kills a creature, which is reactive and won't help you win for combo. Shining Shoal may have some kind of application where you'd want to redirect lethal to someone in some way. Need a big white fatty or something though. Perhaps would fit into the Swans deck somehow..with Blasphemous Act or something"
mtgmarketwatch,3aswgm,sorrynopic,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:23:39 2015 UTC,"Sickening shoal is used (usually) as a 2 of in the sideboard for manaless dredge in legacy.  I can't think, off the top of my head, where else it is played or what deck would want it."

mtgmarketwatch,3aoemh,TiredTofu,3,Mon Jun 22 04:34:29 2015 UTC,"The name of the card doesn't lend itself easily to a reprint, so a functional reprint is more likely in standard. Even Commander seems like an unlikely place for Tendo."
mtgmarketwatch,3aoemh,remyseven,2,Mon Jun 22 06:38:23 2015 UTC,Tendo Ice Bridge is probably safe from a reprint for a long time (2 years easy) and is from a small print run. It's seeing a lot more use so it could end up comparable to something like Grove of the Burnwillows or Horizon Canopy.
mtgmarketwatch,3aoemh,BelcherSucks,1 point,Mon Jun 22 06:28:02 2015 UTC,Were Grove and Horizon always at 40$ or did they spike over the last few weeks or months too? I can't remember those two being so expensive.
mtgmarketwatch,3aoemh,CatsOP,2,Mon Jun 22 23:05:33 2015 UTC,"Grove has been up and down for a while, but since it became a mainstay in the base Green Tron lists (which usually use Pyroclasm in the main or side), Living End lists (as a pain free land that never comes into play tapped is powerful), and in Legacy decks featuring Punishing Fire it hit 30+ and veered towards $40. The rise in Horizon Canopy is mostly attributed to various use in Junk/Zoo/Pod lists before it became a key part of the GW Auras/Hexproof deck."

mtgmarketwatch,3aoemh,vxicepickxv,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:19:56 2015 UTC,"In this environment?  It doesn't seem like you can make any bets against a card spiking.  Some cards spiking are definitely deserving of higher prices, but some have me shaking my head.  That isn't in reference to this card, btw.  I've learned to be weary of buying any cards when people, especially pros, start saying something should be banned, or a deck should have something(s) in it banned.  I've seen it mentioned twice at least by different people that have played at large events.  It maybe nothing but sour grapes, but me?  I'm getting rid of everything I own from that deck.  I hate getting burned by the ban hammer as I have many times by ignoring the ban talk.  That's not going to happen again if i can help it."
mtgmarketwatch,3aoemh,ahdamnit,-4,Mon Jun 22 05:17:27 2015 UTC,The thing is though that when the pros are clamoring for a ban its rarely because a card deserves a ban and more because they are butthurt.  The way I see it is that this deck is getting the Griselbrand where a few pros dont like it so they are actively trying to get it banned.    Its not putting up anywhere near the numbers that Jund or Pod did when they had cards banned and its not gonna be banned for time/fun issues like eggs.  I honestly have yet to see a single logical point for why the deck should be banned.
mtgmarketwatch,3aoemh,Little_Gray,4,Mon Jun 22 06:03:54 2015 UTC,It can effectively end the game earlier than WotC wants. The same reasoning  they applied when they banned Seething Song despite a lack of results from Storm.
mtgmarketwatch,3aoemh,Gordonuts,-1,Mon Jun 22 07:01:29 2015 UTC,Seething song was banned because of power level and the results that storm was able to put up.  It made it far to easy to consistently go off to early.
mtgmarketwatch,3aoemh,Little_Gray,5,Mon Jun 22 12:54:53 2015 UTC,"Nope. Storm was putting up worse results than Bloom currently is. SS was banned in January of 2013. in the entirety of 2012 Storm made up 4% of top 8 decks.  In the last 2 months Bloom has made up 7% of top 8 decks. Bloom is performing approximately twice as well as Storm was when SS was banned, and can go off before turn 4 about as frequently."
mtgmarketwatch,3aoemh,Gordonuts,3,Mon Jun 22 14:41:06 2015 UTC,"Like I said it could just be sour grapes, but a driving force behind bannings is player complaints.  It is a few people now but later? Who knows.  Uncertainty is one thing but uncertainty with stink hanging around it is something I'm not looking to get into."
mtgmarketwatch,3aoemh,ahdamnit,-2,Mon Jun 22 07:03:37 2015 UTC,No the driving force behind bannings is not player complaints.  If it was then we would have a vastly different modern format.
mtgmarketwatch,3aoemh,Little_Gray,4,Mon Jun 22 12:53:04 2015 UTC,"What are you on about? Every card banned in recent history was preceded by many pros discussing its effect on the format and calling for it to be banned. Birthing Pod, Treasure Cruise, Deathrite Shaman... All one needs to do is have tuned into the GP Charlotte pre-game show and hear that even CVM who played Amulet Bloom to the finals of an Open calls for it to be put in line with the rest of the format via a ban."
mtgmarketwatch,3aoemh,jjness,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:23:57 2015 UTC,the pros have a lot more swing than you think. I'm just glad wotc doesn't listen to the ones who hate modern.
mtgmarketwatch,3aoemh,GosuMagic,-1,Mon Jun 22 21:00:10 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think all these buyouts are disgusting. I had almost completed my amulet deck, but I made the mistake of buying the expensive cards first. I picked up my pacts, azusas, prime times, etc. Summer bloom was $0.25 for every edition. Amulets and ancient stirrings were less than $1. These are key parts of the deck, I expected them to go up.   But gemstone mine and tendo? Now I have to spend $70 on 5 horrible cards? They have incredible synergy with the deck, but it's disgusting to see buyouts like that happen. Even though I've spent over $350 on the other cards, I feel like not even getting into modern if I have to put up with this. I don't want to buy these crap cards at these insane prices because I don't want to encourage the sad, nasty crap happening to our community. I doubt i'm alone."
mtgmarketwatch,3anjmn,psucameron,5,Sun Jun 21 23:35:16 2015 UTC,It works if the card is good and there's a limited supply.
mtgmarketwatch,3anjmn,5-s,5,Sun Jun 21 23:39:27 2015 UTC,So if there isn't a small supply and the card is mediocre do people just end up sitting on their copies?
mtgmarketwatch,3anjmn,KerrickLong,2,Mon Jun 22 00:02:41 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's what happened with Foil $(Feed the Clan)s."
mtgmarketwatch,3anjmn,echomtg-com,0,Mon Jun 22 08:40:28 2015 UTC,Feed the Clan | Khans of Tarkir  $0.13 mid | $0.03 low | $14.95 foil  (last updated 6-22-15 at 9am EST from tcgplayer)  Links: More Price Details | Card Image  | Gatherer and Oracle
mtgmarketwatch,3anjmn,Mick_Myage,5,Mon Jun 22 08:42:20 2015 UTC,"I think the buyout creates a little bit of price memory. Take a card that is $0.25. Say its a lynch-pin in a wonky deck people aren't prepared for that top8's or wins. If there is then a legitimate buyout (not just people wanting to try the deck) the card will spike say to $5.00. Since the deck isn't really good and not many people actually want the card the price starts to move back down. But know people have some visibility to the card and when the price gets low they think ""that was in a good deck, I should buy it"". This keeps the card from getting back down to $0.25, maybe it stops at a $1.00. It won't keep the price up at the buyout price but there is an impact."
mtgmarketwatch,3anjmn,anubis647,2,Mon Jun 22 00:17:18 2015 UTC,It takes a much longer time for a price to fall back down than it does to go up during a buyout. Price memory can last for months depending on the circumstances.
mtgmarketwatch,3anjmn,Little_Gray,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:45:38 2015 UTC,Yes buyouts have a lasting impact.  Whenever a card gets bought out it never goes back down to its previous price.
mtgmarketwatch,3anjmn,asmodeanreborn,4,Mon Jun 22 01:59:53 2015 UTC,"Whenever a card gets bought out it never goes back down to its previous price.     That's not true - look what happened to Aluren. It went from $5 to $24 and now it's back to even lower than it started at, sitting at $4.69. Sure, it took a year before it went down under $6, but it still happened. A card that has no real demand will inevitably crawl back down."
mtgmarketwatch,3anjmn,worldchrisis,6,Mon Jun 22 04:39:48 2015 UTC,"It took 2 years to get back to its previous price, and that's a card that sees basically 0 play.   A card that sees any amount of play that gets bought out isn't going to go back down to the previous level."
mtgmarketwatch,3anjmn,foldingcouch,2,Mon Jun 22 04:50:39 2015 UTC,"You're describing two different effects here - magnitude of price correction and speed of price correction.    Magnitude of price correction means how much the price changes following a spike - this depends on how much play the card sees.  Aluren went up to 24 but back down to its original 5, so over the long term the magnitude of the correction was zero.  This is because, as you rightly pointed out, there's almost zero Aluren play in any format.  Modern staples, on the other hand, are going to see significant price corrections on a buyout because they're played, and there will be demand for them at the new price in a way there just wasn't for Aluren.   Speed of price correction means how fast the price is going to settle following a spike - this depends on card availability.  Aluren, despite seeing almost no play, is a reserve list rare from an old set.  Quantity is limited, and retailers have no fear of a reprint so they are content to hold onto them for a long time to maximize the amount they can get out of the card.  That's why it took two years for the price to come back down.  Modern staples, on the other hand, have at most 2 years before they're in serious reprint risk, and every product cycle that a retailer holds a staple for they're risking losing value.  A snapcaster mage is going to price-correct a lot faster than Aluren because nobody wants to get caught with 10 snapcasters when the inevitable reprint is announced."

mtgmarketwatch,3aixf1,anubis647,10,Sat Jun 20 18:12:15 2015 UTC,Threads is a reasonable card.  Look at more of the Woo cards.  Disrupting Shoal or something.  Things that don't see much play.
mtgmarketwatch,3aixf1,CorpT,3,Sat Jun 20 18:14:13 2015 UTC,Disrupting Shoal is $13 still.
mtgmarketwatch,3aixf1,Brawler_1337,3,Sun Jun 21 02:14:27 2015 UTC,that is a recent bounce back - shoal was back to $5 for a long time there
mtgmarketwatch,3aixf1,stitches_extra,3,Sun Jun 21 03:40:55 2015 UTC,"Threads of Disloyalty is not one these novelty cards. Nourishing Shoal (and similar cards like Fist of the Suns, Disrupting SHoal) show up out of nowhere and become hot. They spike up a few thousand percent and then start to cool down as people dig em out and sell them off. Then they spike again from another surge in interest so the people who had them dump them off to the people who are currently interested. Against, interest is satiated and they start falling.  Threads was a clutch sideboard card during a time when Goyf and Confidant were everywhere and Twin was less prominent. If creatures like Goyf, Confidant, Young Pyro, and the other sweet cheap ones start taking up 60% of the meta again then Threads will bounce back. But now is now that meta."
mtgmarketwatch,3aixf1,BelcherSucks,2,Sun Jun 21 04:03:32 2015 UTC,"I guess all I meant was that it showed a huge spike because it got a lot of publicity at a single event similar to this situation. Threads obviously has much more use as a card than Shoal in Modern, so maybe I should have picked a different card."
mtgmarketwatch,3aixf1,anubis647,2,Sun Jun 21 14:09:28 2015 UTC,Threads of Disloyalty is interesting because it is super unique in terms of power and effect and how rarely it pops up.  When it does(every few months) it rockets.  Then it falls as people stop running.
mtgmarketwatch,3aixf1,Unknown_Phate,2,Sun Jun 21 00:06:06 2015 UTC,I think Fist of Suns is the better example
mtgmarketwatch,3aixf1,Jackomatrus,3,Tue Jun 23 12:08:10 2015 UTC,"According to mtgstocks, it's already starting to go down."
mtgmarketwatch,3aixf1,Peripheryy,4,Sat Jun 20 17:17:39 2015 UTC,"This is one of the ""problems"" people have with mtgfinance, sticky prices. Speculators don't really get punished if their spec doesn't perform and I believe the reason for this is twofold.  Firstly, the casual market is real. Even if this new iteration of Griselcannon doesn't stick as a mainstay of the meta, there are plenty of casuals who may want to build it. Even if down the road the deck fades into obscurity I still imagine there will be some demand; the card is now on the map.  More importantly, you can't short magic cards. The ability to short in a normal market helps lead to adequate price discovery. Because there's no incentive to prove a spike may be unjustified, prices tend to stick somewhere above the previous low."

mtgmarketwatch,3aixf1,jassi007,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:37:18 2015 UTC,"Well, given that the term 'spike' in this context describes a sudden sharp increase followed by an equal (or nearly so) decrease, which creates a spike shape on a graph, the answer is - not long.  If it maintains its new price level then it's a jump, not a spike."
mtgmarketwatch,3agzex,Mrbond404,13,Sat Jun 20 02:21:55 2015 UTC,"Theros gods are a long hold. Hardly any of their price comes from Standard. They're EDH and casual all-stars but that set was opened ... so much.   I believe they'll slowly trickle out of the market and command a much different price in two or three years (like the Eldrazi titans). What that price ends up being, I have no idea, but the eternal nature of Commander means the gods go into decks and most likely never come out.   Anecdotally, I work at a card shop and see players lapse or quit all the time. Often, they end up keeping their eternal decks ""just in case"" so there's a scenario where players quitting won't noticeably increase supply."
mtgmarketwatch,3agzex,jeremiahvedder,3,Sat Jun 20 04:09:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think I underestimated the drive of the EDH format. I want to believe they will see a price gain, but just need some clarity."
mtgmarketwatch,3agzex,Rockenos,2,Sat Jun 20 08:42:01 2015 UTC,"Also, keep in mind that they're difficult to reprint. I could potentially see an EDH deck cycle featuring either all of the mono color Gods or all of the multi color Gods (less likely) a few years down the road, but both wouldn't be reprinted and people didn't like Theros enough for ""Return to Theros"" to be a thing any time soon. It's definitely a long hold, but it's a safe hold."
mtgmarketwatch,3agzex,MortalSword_MTG,0,Sat Jun 20 22:51:48 2015 UTC,"Purphoros has combo deck written all over him. We probably don't have the right pieces at the moment, but there will be a time when someone breaks him wide open with a Modern combo deck, and then anyone holding him will make a lot of money.   Most of the other gods are just really decent EDH cards, but keep an eye on the ones that see play in Modern."
mtgmarketwatch,3agzex,Manadyne,3,Fri Jun 26 12:40:13 2015 UTC,"Thassa sees limited play in Merfolk.  Keranos sees limited play as a finisher in various decks.  The remainder of the Gods hold value mostly due to casual and EDH appeal.  They're also going to be very difficult to reprint without returning to Theros.  Even a single part of the cycle is 5 of mythics in a set.  We might see one or two in duel decks or the pre constructed Commander decks.  If using one as a commander, with the new tuck changes, they're very resilient and difficult to deal with, which makes them ideal.  Xenagos is the lynchpin of a $50 EDH deck that just ramps and turns fatties sideways, so he's popular.  They're not going to rocket up like Snapcasters, but rather see slow and incremental gains.  Something like the Praetor cycle might be the best analog."
mtgmarketwatch,3agzex,TravvyJ,4,Sat Jun 20 06:46:46 2015 UTC,"Because of recent articles on what the Theros rotational buys, holds and sells should be (I think on mtggoldfish). The author pretty much said to buy all the gods.  It continues to distress me how much these types on articles drive speculation. They mention one card and all the speculators stampede like elephants to buy all copies up."
mtgmarketwatch,3agzex,Rock-swarm,14,Sat Jun 20 02:37:05 2015 UTC,"It would be distressing if it wasn't backed up by evidence, but that's simply not the case.  The gods are one of the few cards from Theros block that vendors are actively buylisting, because they KNOW they are casual hits. If CFB is buylisting Mogis at $2, that creates a price floor for the card. It's not a ""stampede"" to buy up all the copies, in fact there are 274 sellers of Mogis on TCGplayer as we speak. Please take the time to actually look at the facts before searching for a scapegoat."
mtgmarketwatch,3agzex,minutehourday,1 point,Sat Jun 20 03:25:51 2015 UTC,I still can't understand how this would increase price. Are people going to start magically playing purphoros in EDH more? Or is it because there are no more printings of JOU and Theros?
mtgmarketwatch,3agzex,Chosler88,9,Sat Jun 20 04:02:31 2015 UTC,"Theros is out of print.  Magic has seen remarkable growth in recent years, especially since 2009.  Much of the reason that snapcaster mage has gone from 20 to 80$ in 2 years has been because of that player growth - there are more players, more of whom want to play modern, and a finite number of snapcasters.  It is reasonable to assume that magic will continue growing for the near future.  We are just wrapping up a very successful block and about to go back to zendikar.  The gods are hard to reprint because they are theros-specific and unique mechanically.  Thus in 3-5 years, when the player base is another 20% or more larger, it is reasonable to assume that a good chunk of those folks will want to play edh or casually, and will want purph or kruphix.  That is more demand, for the same number of cards (actually, there will be fewer gods in circulation because losing cards to wear and tear or people exiting the game and putting their collections in storage is a real thing).  Thus, the price will rise.  More players, fewer copies, cards that are loved in popular formats like edh."
mtgmarketwatch,3agzex,Chosler88,4,Sat Jun 20 04:15:27 2015 UTC,"Point No. 5 is often overlooked. Not necessarily storage, but cards do disappear. Even if the player base doesn't grow, it will rotate. The guy who played in Theros and has gods may take a break while someone who was taking a break during Theros comes back. That's a bunch of gods sitting forgotten in a binder at someone's house, and doesn't help the new guy with his gods. This is why you'll see price increases even if the player base stayed flat."
mtgmarketwatch,3agzex,Rock-swarm,2,Sat Jun 20 07:52:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah I have been seeing a lot of these comments lately, and I think I underestimate the behavior of EDH players. When my friends retire an EDH deck it often ends up on a shelf untouched for months.   Also much love for the brainstorm brewery podcast. I look forward to them every week."
mtgmarketwatch,3agzex,TravvyJ,2,Sat Jun 20 08:44:35 2015 UTC,"That's awesome to hear, thank you!"
mtgmarketwatch,3agzex,pengox80,6,Sun Jun 21 03:23:13 2015 UTC,"It's not an increase in price.   http://mtgstocks.com/cards/22872  The buylist sets the floor. As a corollary - if a major vendor is looking to buylist most of the Theros gods, it means that an entity with a rather powerful incentive to correctly predict singles market demand has decided to bet on Theros gods being long-term winners.   Are people going to start magically playing purphoros in EDH more? Or is it because there are no more printings of JOU and Theros?   Purphoros has an ability that synergizes with creatures entering the battlefield. That's pretty generic, so he conceivably gets better anytime WotC pushes the envelop in terms of token generators or cheating creatures into play. This only adds to Purphoros' demand in the long-term. A similar argument can be made for the other gods, as the card pool increases favorable reactions with their effects."
mtgmarketwatch,3agzex,Rock-swarm,-4,Sat Jun 20 04:18:45 2015 UTC,"So the articles had no effect then? Sorry. Not buying it. I've seen it time and again. Finance writers most definitely have an effect of buying trends. Not everyone reaches these conclusions on their own, and many can be manipulated by those ""in the know"". Even posts on various subreddits can have this effect. It's not just the invisible hand of the market."
mtgmarketwatch,3agzex,HaeMtg,3,Sat Jun 20 05:07:54 2015 UTC,"Cards like Heritage Druid, Marro-Gnawer, It That Betrays, Eldrazi Conscription, Akroma's Memorial, Door of Destinies, Ink-Eyes etc. etc. all lend themselves to certain strategies that casual players love (lords, creature-wide effects, controlling your opponent's stuff). The gods all do similar things and have great flavor so it's widely thought that they will behave like these past lords because they're ""cool"" and flashy.   This isn't always the case, like with Master of Waves (because elementals are not a hot tribe) or with archetype lords that don't help make creatures in their archetypes better (Guile, Dread, Purity and Hostility). Vigor breaks this trend because it does make creatures better in a casual favorite way ala Doubling Season.  The gods are all very hard to get rid of (you can't disenchant, shatter, etc. it and it takes a remove from game effect to really take it out) and they do some powerful things (Purphuros, Thassa) or casual favorite things (banner effects, double mana, mill).   Sure the articles will hype this effect up, but even if the writers didn't identify these things, people can see that these are powerful effects and the gods would raise over time anyway as new players come in, or old players that didn't bother picking up the gods realize they really like a certain god for X, Y or Z deck. Sleepers like Heritage Druid and Marrow-Gnawer illustrate this ""casual favorite"" effect because they aren't great in competitive decks (until recently, Elves weren't great in modern, but that would explain why this uncommon has now spiked and is now a $20 card, when it was only 5-10 for years due to EDH elves/some Legacy play), but are cool flavor wise and powerful enough to gain in value, as long as they aren't reprinted anytime soon.   The only problem I see with this strategy is that the gods are perfect for Commander and not many are competitive staples that need to be used as a 4-of, so calling the gods ""sure fire picks"" is still a bit risky. Blaming the writers is just trying to find a scapegoat for the fact that a lot of people with disposable incomes really like paying absurd amounts of money for pieces of cardboard."
mtgmarketwatch,3agzex,kylemon10,2,Sat Jun 20 05:54:06 2015 UTC,"Of course they have an effect. But that's not why we are having this conversation. You listed the effect that articles have on speculation as ""distressing"". Why is solid, logical writing on the playability of a magic card a bad thing? By your logic, consumer reports on the quality of autos in simulated car crashes is distressing because it directs safety - conscious buyers towards certain car models..."

mtgmarketwatch,3ab1a0,Rockenos,3,Thu Jun 18 18:03:05 2015 UTC,"Price memory is weird, but I expect something like this to go back almost down to what it had been. This isn't a card like Deceiver Exarch or even something weird like Fist of Suns. It's never seen ANY competitive success or backing by a pro in its history, and it's pretty apparent that the deck itself was much more the beneficiary of a surprise factor than being an actual toptier deck (not to take anything away from its pilot). Given that it has no interest in ANY format and outside of this one showing would never have a reason to be outside a bulk box, I don't think it'll maintain even a buck."

mtgmarketwatch,3a6b6c,mtd14,11,Wed Jun 17 15:53:53 2015 UTC,"yea, there may be more of a slide. There are folks who are trading out MM staples at their highs for other cards (watch out for a legacy spike).  The cards that will fall harder are casual cards and non-staple legendary cards (read: kozelik, ulamog, iona, etc). Staples may slide a little but not a lot (splinter twin, spellskite noble etc). Casual or tier twos will slide a bit more (daybreak coronet)  Goyf didn't have a great showing in the T8 but had a great showing in T32. As folks look to pilot T8 decks, you'll see goyfs change hands or get traded in drop in value. Over the course of the last week, I went from being offered my 2 snapcasters + stuff for a goyf to 2 snapcasters for a goyf + stuff."

mtgmarketwatch,3a73ta,Mrbond404,5,Wed Jun 17 19:14:56 2015 UTC,"I don't see 5 color commander's increasing demand THAT much, most EDH players already have a lantern(even if they just play 2 color usually) and you can already play 5 color EDH so it won't be opening a new magical market.  There's also a real possibility wizards would just include it in the deck(s)"
mtgmarketwatch,3a73ta,Shitposters,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:22:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah after thinking about it a bit more I think it would become reprinted in a 5 color precon, if they made one."
mtgmarketwatch,3a73ta,shor,3,Wed Jun 17 19:27:22 2015 UTC,"Or would the increased demand just put a massive target on its back for a reprint?   Chromatic Lantern is already a near certainty for a reprint in the next Commander product.   Practically every single card at the top of the most played EDH list gets a reprint from Wizards and Chromatic Lantern is the most played EDH card yet to receive a reprint on the Metamox list: http://www.metamox.com/commander/  As others have said, the foils are much safer. For non-foils you probably want to be outing these before the next Commander supplement drops - probably Nov 2015..."
mtgmarketwatch,3a73ta,Little_Gray,3,Thu Jun 18 02:18:12 2015 UTC,If they are creating a 4-5 color commander deck it will have lantern in it.
mtgmarketwatch,3a73ta,blindfremen,2,Thu Jun 18 02:23:53 2015 UTC,Foils are a much safer bet. Right now they are only a ~2.3x multiplier.

mtgmarketwatch,3a422w,DLink123,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:22:13 2015 UTC,I have not ordered from them as this store is a recent merge between Saitocardshop (Run by pro player Tomoharu Saito) and another seller.

They have been fairly stable in price as they are expensive and not something very many people even know about let alone want.    English is more expensive because it is much much rarer then the Japanese one.    ** I have an English one in elves and have had a Japanese one in my binder for well over a year and not one person has been interested in it once they learned the value.

I know its not an Elf, but if it were I could see it sky rocketing. That being said, it still can be played as a side in any top white or green deck.  I am asking is it powerful enough to shut down Snapcaster as much as any other card out there? I know Path would work well, but Path is also not a creature nor is it $0.31"
mtgmarketwatch,3a1z4p,echomtg-com,0,Tue Jun 16 16:49:17 2015 UTC,"Not only is it not good enough against Snapcaster, it's not in any good decks or decks that would expect to become good enough without some seriously powerful new card.

No spike or buyout here, just demand from people who need  them for a variety of competitive decks.    EDIT: We really need to have some sort of rule in place regarding titles. Things like this one are lazy and not only are they lazy, they promote circulation of a bad stereotype within the community. When this sub was first made people were actually putting effort into not just the title but the post itself. Posts like this do zero for the community."

I was curious if people thought there was actual demand, or just another buyout/spike. Apparently the past day or so has been real growth while it had doubled, or I'm not watching real price sites."

mtgmarketwatch,39xujr,ahdamnit,2,Mon Jun 15 18:02:30 2015 UTC,It cant be sustainable.  Its a standard foil and set redemption's are just getting started.  Just another case of some random idiot with a bunch of money trying to raise prices.    Then again I dont think all of these recent price jumps are sustainable.  Call me a doomsayer if you want but I think there is going to be a crash is modern prices.  The same thing is happening here that happened with legacy.
mtgmarketwatch,39xujr,Little_Gray,4,Mon Jun 15 18:21:32 2015 UTC,"It's still being opened yes, but for how long?  Origins pre-release is in less than a month, 7-11 and 12, and BFZ is on 9-26 and 27. After Origins comes out how many people will be drafting KTK?  After BFZ comes out?  The non-foil might not spike now but soon? It should at least start heading upward due to the decrease in new ones hitting the market soon.  It seems to me that if now isn't the best time to buy them then it soon will be.  Also with set redemption for DTK, is it going to be opened in great amounts online after Origins? I'm not greatly familiar with MTGO, but I thought that due to the next set coming out it gets supplanted or mostly in the drafts."
mtgmarketwatch,39xujr,Little_Gray,-1,Mon Jun 15 18:58:27 2015 UTC,"Its true that the final set in the block gets opened considerably less then everything else.  The price will go down once the ""new"" feeling wears off and people stop overreacting to buyouts.    Now is an absolute horrible time to buy them.  They literally just spiked in price because of a buyout.  The market is extremely unstable right now since it seems somebody recently found out there is a crapton of money to be made by triggering buyouts on TCG."
mtgmarketwatch,39xujr,jjness,0,Mon Jun 15 19:23:22 2015 UTC,"Its true that the final set in the block gets opened considerably less then everything else.   That doesn't stand true when the last set of the (now retired 3-set) block is a large set with it's own draft format (Rise/Eldrazi) or as a 2-pack draft format (DTK), does it?"
mtgmarketwatch,39xujr,Little_Gray,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:00:06 2015 UTC,"It pretty much always gets opened less.  Its a summer set and the final set in the block which both works against it.  Magic attendance drops off during the summer as people have better things to do.  This coupled with the continuous release on supplemental products and the short time its in the draft format really hurts it.  Its why third set cards often behave differently then others, ever when they are large sets."
mtgmarketwatch,39xujr,Rock-swarm,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:04:29 2015 UTC,"It still does. There are problems inherent to the timing of the third set release, which almost always makes them poor sellers compared to first-set sales. Some of it is intentional as well. WotC understands that they have to ""hook"" players on a new standard format, so first sets in new blocks tend to have overtly powerful and popular cards (hence thoughtseize in Theros, fetchlands in KTK, etc.). They don't want to risk players being disengaged with the block from the very first set, because that has financial repercussions for the other 2 sets as well. WotC was actually extremely worried about the reception of the Theros draft format, because it ended up sabotaging product sales of BNG and JOU."
mtgmarketwatch,39xujr,KidJustice,-3,Tue Jun 16 01:18:16 2015 UTC,"Pod was a ~$10 card for most of 2014 before the spike.  If not for the banning talk right after the spike it would have most likely stayed up in price until it got banned.  IMO CoCo is better than Pod, wasn't in an event Deck as a 2 of, only had 2 deck iterations vs the 4 or more that CoCo has now, and NPH didn't have a Modern Masters set to contend with it for drafts.  If CoCo is in more supply I doubt it's by very much and to counter act that there's more decks to put it in.  I doubt this card drops much, if at all.  Also most of it's demand is modern and very little from standard so that should also help to keep it from dropping."

mtgmarketwatch,39xujr,Little_Gray,-3,Mon Jun 15 20:45:53 2015 UTC,CoCo is currently in print where as pod had rotated out years before.  It also took a massive spike in modern popularity for the card to be worth anything even though its supply was much less then that of CoCo.    The card will drop in price just like everything else does.  You say its demand (is value) is from mostly in modern but dont understand that that is a reason why it will go down in price.
mtgmarketwatch,39xujr,Gordonuts,2,Mon Jun 15 19:55:53 2015 UTC,The same thing is happening here that happened with Legacy.   Except Legacy prices haven't crashed.
mtgmarketwatch,39xujr,jbmoskow,-5,Tue Jun 16 05:13:16 2015 UTC,.... Yea expect for you know that near boardwide 20% drop in prices.
mtgmarketwatch,39xujr,Little_Gray,2,Tue Jun 16 12:12:13 2015 UTC,"There has been no such drop. Unless you're referring to the natural drop that occurred after the huge spike that happened last summer, in which case that was a net increase in prices by about 75% for duals, a 50% increase in many non dual staples. And let's not forget about the 500% increase in Omniscience and 300% increase in Cunning Wish"

As it is they see no play outside standard, other than a bit of casual demand, and are about to rotate out of standard, meaning they will be unneeded by the vast majority of players. Supply is far out stripping demand. Expect them to be about $1-2 on average after rotation. Might be worth grabbing playsets then, for eventual casual demand and maybe a reprint, now that scry is evergreen."

mtgmarketwatch,39zxrg,Rock-swarm,2,Tue Jun 16 05:30:38 2015 UTC,Ad Nauseam is pretty much the only Modern deck that plays them. Coming into play tapped is too big of a tempo cost for most decks in Modern.

Temples are not ""good in modern"".  Your insistence on maintaining your preconceptions in the face of conflicting evidence is an interesting position to take.   That being said, I'm not advocating that anyone invest in Temples, nor would I consider slotting them in just any Modern deck. Just wanted to point out that there are some cases where they see play, which goes in the opposite of the OP I responded to saying they see ""no play outside of standard""."
mtgmarketwatch,39zxrg,MortalSword_MTG,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:48:51 2015 UTC,"Just wanted to point out that there are some cases where they see play   I'm not sure why you're responding to me, then. The guy I responded to said they saw play in one deck. I clarified that actually they saw play in two decks.   Anyway, a single high-place finish in a large event is not significant on its own. Obviously we can't break out p values and stuff, but both Ad Nauseam and GriselShenanigans.dec have been floating around the fringes of Modern for a long time now. Why haven't they done well in more events? Because they're incredibly high-variance, not because they are suddenly much better than they used to be. Griselbrand combo is a silly deck, even if it turns out to be a mainstay of the format over the next few Modern seasons. It works sometimes, but it's an absurd deck in the same way that Cheerios is an absurd Legacy deck.   So yes, Temples are not good in Modern. The fact that two combo decks with Temples made the top 8 of a GP doesn't change that, especially if they are literally the only decks in Modern that use them. Sometimes bad decks do well, and sometimes good decks play bad cards. This is one of those two scenarios, and time will tell which it is."
mtgmarketwatch,39zxrg,wintermute93,-1,Wed Jun 17 01:01:31 2015 UTC,"Is Splinter Twin not good in Modern? Arcbound Ravager? Inkmoth Nexus?  Do I have to keep listing cards that see play in one deck to point out that dealing in your kind of absolutes is blatantly false? There is a world of difference between saying that ""xxxx sees fringe play in Modern, don't buy in"" and ""xxxx is bad/sees no play in Modern"" when there if recent evidence to the contrary. Remember when Thragtusk rotated and everyone said there was no way it'd see play in Modern outside of maybe a one-of in Pod? Except now it pops up in the form of a couple copies in a few different decks. My point is that I very much wish that people like yourself would stop speaking with absolutely certainty all the time. Its a plague upon this community, particularly the financial side. Acknowledging fringe application and qualifying it as fringe is the best way to educate someone who is asking questions.   Further, Top 8 in a 15 round GP is meaningful, but no one is trying to say it will become a dominant top tier deck. Rogue/fringe decks attack when they are least expected, that's their beauty.    So yes, Temples are not good in Modern. The fact that two combo decks with Temples made the top 8 of a GP doesn't change that, especially if they are literally the only decks in Modern that use them. Sometimes bad decks do well, and sometimes good decks play bad cards. This is one or both of those scenarios.   Who made you the arbiter of what is good or bad?

Cards like Splinter Twin and Daybreak Coronet were dollar rares once. Nothing in Magic is absolute.

One of the big names on MTGSalvation forums, Dyne, who's basically the Affinity expert, has cut Blood Moon from the sideboard altogether since Deathrite Shaman's ban. I also don't think Blood Moon is a card you want as a 1-of, I believe Reid Duke mentioned that it's an all in plan in which you want 3 Blood Moon or none so you can commit to the Blood Moon plan.  I personally wouldn't buy it, maybe trade for it.

The splice onto arcane shenanigans in the deck are insane: For the unaware, one of the big interactions is that you can pitch-cast Nourishing Shoal while splicing rituals and / or Goryo's Vengance's onto it to make up for the card disadvantage of using the Nourishing Shoal. It also lets you keep your important combo piece in Vengance in the tank rather than having to actually expend it when playing against counterspells."
mtgmarketwatch,39u7qk,banecroft,2,Mon Jun 15 08:32:13 2015 UTC,Can you explain the counterspell bit in more detail? Not sure I get the interaction
mtgmarketwatch,39u7qk,stravant,3,Mon Jun 15 08:54:42 2015 UTC,"If you think your opponent has a Counterspell you can do something like cast Desperate Ritual splicing Goryo's Vengeance onto it (Goryo's Vengance has Splice onto Arcane 2B). Even if your opponent counters the Desperate Ritual, then you still have the Goryo's Vengeance in hand to try again next turn.

mtgmarketwatch,39u7qk,banecroft,2,Mon Jun 15 09:10:58 2015 UTC,That's..amazing. Thanks for the explaination!
mtgmarketwatch,39u7qk,Chosler88,2,Mon Jun 15 09:48:37 2015 UTC,This was bought out last night by people who believed in the deck.
mtgmarketwatch,39u7qk,ExplosPlankton,1 point,Mon Jun 15 03:40:07 2015 UTC,Worldspine Wurm has also just about doubled in price.
mtgmarketwatch,39u7qk,Watchyobak,1 point,Mon Jun 15 03:39:50 2015 UTC,"Question, what are the chances the price drops significantly? I have been playing the deck for the past few months, and I am in the other boat. I think this weekend was a pretty big anomaly. The deck has really solid tron matchup and bloom titan, but in all honesty it still struggles heavily with twin, jund, and delver decks (cheap counters+clock). I think people simply did not know what to counter/what to take with discard spells. I couldn't be happier my latest pet deck made a top 8, but I also think it is rather short lived. So my question: should I sell my Goryo's and Through the Breach's now while its spiked, or is there still more room to grow? Also why has there not been a similar rise in griselbrand's price?"
mtgmarketwatch,39u7qk,blindfremen,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:59:14 2015 UTC,"I don't know the deck well enough to comment on it specifically but based on your comments I agree the meta will respond if it can. You can believe at the next major tournament we will see more people playing this deck and the good players who don't want to play it (dedicated control players/twin players) will be ready to react to it.  If you believe what you say (it has bad match-ups against common decks) then sell out now, wait for the hype to die down, buy back in.  I'm tempted to buy Griselbrands in case the spike is coming (just to have Griselbrands for casual shenanigans)."

mtgmarketwatch,39qf2i,Chosler88,3,Sun Jun 14 05:34:28 2015 UTC,"Really good article. Nice to see the buylist photos from vendors. The first indication that MM2 prices were going to maintain their pre-GP prices were the high buylist prices at Vegas, so it's interesting to see the buylists in Charlotte.  I also agree with the take on Confidant. There is an almost bizarre pessimism toward this card, with all sorts of fantheories about how he's now terrible because of some nebulous problems with high-cost cards or Burn. If so, then no one running Jund got the memo, because he's still appearing as a full playset in every Jund deck. If you look at the historical prices for Bob, he was at an all-time high before KTK. He disappeared because Jund disappeared in the hostile post-KTK meta. Now that Jund is back, so is Bob. It's just a question of when people realize he's still the best card advantage generator in Modern, not if."
mtgmarketwatch,39qf2i,gamblekat,1 point,Sun Jun 14 06:12:47 2015 UTC,"No, tasigur has pretty clearly taken the mantle of CA engine, with existing archetypes splashing a third color for him and better removal spells. With that said, the drop in electrolyze and a rise in decks that require removal beyond lightning bolt has given Bob some meta space to return. I still don't like Bob as a deck choice in jund, and would rather play more copies of tasigur, ooze, or finks."
mtgmarketwatch,39qf2i,Rock-swarm,2,Sun Jun 14 08:26:08 2015 UTC,"Tasigur supplements Bob, he doesn't replace him. Tasigur has the disadvantage of coming down later, costing more, being legendary so you can't run more than a couple copies, and requiring a fairly heft activation cost. People run him primarily to get the one-mana 4/5, not because he's a great card advantage generator.  If you look at what lists have been putting up results, virtually everyone is running 4x Confidant plus potentially some amount of Outpost Siege. Most lists only run one Tasigur."
mtgmarketwatch,39qf2i,gamblekat,2,Sun Jun 14 17:00:29 2015 UTC,"It's just a question of when people realize he's still the best card advantage generator in Modern, not if.   You misunderstand. I'm not referencing Tasigur in Jund, I'm referencing Tasigur in the meta as a whole. He can come down as soon as Bob does, survives better, and doesn't become a liability in the burn or zoo matchup. He's the reason Delver lists still exist, the reason Junk no longer plays Bob, and the reason twin is suddenly running a third color."
mtgmarketwatch,39qf2i,Rock-swarm,2,Sun Jun 14 18:19:08 2015 UTC,"Oh, sure. Bob is an exclusively Jund card. I'm just saying that Bob is back in the meta in a big way now that Jund is top-tier again."
mtgmarketwatch,39qf2i,gamblekat,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:23:22 2015 UTC,"the reason twin is suddenly running a third color.   No. Twin is running him because he is in color. They're playing black for that sweet, sweet Kolaghan's Command value."

An article on mtgfinance marked it as a solid pick-up, for a couple of valid reasons, so now there's a lot of people willing to burn 200 pucapoints on a playset or two on the off-chance that legacy demand drives the price up a year or two from now.  Honestly, I don't really see the card climbing that much, barring some sudden explosion in legacy popularity. Modern's meta isn't really about card draw, and some of the most popular CA engines (confidant, gifts, outpost siege, LotV) don't actually draw you extra cards."

mtgmarketwatch,39ncib,TabinD3,6,Fri Jun 12 23:46:25 2015 UTC,The boxes are not going to stay at $200.  They price will go up and it will not take all that long.  The EV of the set is actually on the rise as most of the big cards have leveled off or even started to climb back up.  The issue with boxes however comes when you actually go to sell them.  If you are gonna resell them online the fees and shipping costs can take a large chunk out of your potential profit.  If you are not shipping them but selling locally then its not an issue but its something that has to be considered.

mtgmarketwatch,39n3rl,Rockenos,1 point,Fri Jun 12 22:39:20 2015 UTC,What do you think it will drop to if it gets reprinted? Since it will be a popular Modern AND Standard card?

However, if he does get reprinted, i believe 15$ will be the floor at peak supply. He'll either be at rare or mythic, and WOTC will know that he will help to sell boxes.   I'd predict 15$, as he would help to make modern burn cheaper, and players would be able to start to transfer their standard red decks into Modern burn. It'll be a harsh cut, but Goblin guide is still a strong, valuable card in it's deck. If Rabble could hit 20 for being a standard only powerhouse, GG wont drop below 15"

mtgmarketwatch,39n3rl,Rockenos,1 point,Fri Jun 12 23:24:23 2015 UTC,"hmmm it will almost definitely not be upgraded to mythic, but it IS also a legacy staple. I think it will preorder at $20 and likely hold that price for a little while after release. It'll most likely sit around $18 til people pick up their playsets for eternal formats, then its price movement will be determined by how much standard play it sees. The fact that it would be in a widely opened fall set (particularly if the zendi fetches are in the set as well) will hurt its potential. If it instantly becomes nuts in standard and is winning tournies left and right (unlikely) it'll stay around 20-25 for a while. If it is mediocre, but sees decent amounts of play, it'll probably stick between 15 and 18. If it can't place in tournaments, it'll go down to 8-10 most likely."

As for it being reprinted in BFZ that is anybodys guess.  Other then the shocks RTR had zero reprints from the original block.

Then, peaking at $11.7 buylist, then steady dip in buylist upon reprinting in MM2015.  TLDR; duel deck reprint, slight drop for 3 months, then increase back."

Its highly unlikely that the person who sole them out of your car knows how to sell on eBay or TCGPlayer. I'd hate to say this... But hopefully its just some dopehead that went to the nearest place he could try and get value for these.  If it was indeed a Magic Player who stole these out of your car... They are gone... If it was a Dopehead... They could be right down the street.  EDIT: The police will do ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about this... They don't even fingerprint stolen cars FYI. When they are found they just have them towed. That is GTA... So they are not going to be ""investigating"" your case. Take a list of the cards to the local card/comic/pawn shops and talk with the owners. They are much more likely to come across them than the police. This pretty much goes for stereo equipment and whatever else gets stolen out of your car."

mtgmarketwatch,39hw9j,Gama_ray,7,Thu Jun 11 20:46:47 2015 UTC,"I'd probably feel comfortable selling foils at this point, but there isn't a huge likelihood that it'll be reprinted before the next Modern Masters.  It's not the kind of card they would put in a casual product, and unless they do another expert-style supplementary product like Conspiracy, I wouldn't expect to see any new copies enter the supply in the near future.  That said, this generally seems like the kind of hype that happened around GP Richmond a while back, and prices settled after that died down.  Selling into the hype is rarely going to bite you, it's buying into the hype that will get you."
mtgmarketwatch,39hw9j,allenthar,3,Thu Jun 11 20:52:42 2015 UTC,If you're not using or planning on using them I entirely reccomend on selling them; especially the foil. Even if you're using them I'd take the foil and turn it into a nonfoil+cash
mtgmarketwatch,39hw9j,Shitposters,5,Fri Jun 12 01:28:55 2015 UTC,Blood Moon is not a $60 card. Its been printed too many times for that. This price can't hold.
mtgmarketwatch,39hw9j,KangaRod,3,Fri Jun 12 04:10:27 2015 UTC,When tons of modern and legacy decks run it sb in at least 2 copies you can honestly say this?
mtgmarketwatch,39hw9j,darnitskippy,6,Fri Jun 12 05:04:57 2015 UTC,"Yes. Compare to Spellskite for a similar card:  Spellskite is sees about twice as much play as Blood Moon. The supply is probably a bit larger on Skellskite... but not that much bigger. Both have been printed in one MM set with Skite being printed probably 50% more there, and all of the old core set printings of Moon probably come pretty close to equaling the NPH printing of skite. I can't imagine there being more than twice as many Skites, and they see twice as much play... and are only $20."
mtgmarketwatch,39hw9j,stravant,-2,Fri Jun 12 07:24:17 2015 UTC,"brings us to the very question:   how many cards are being hoarded by ""financiers"" and the detrimental effect hoarding/""financing"" has on the health of the game  Once the mtg bubble pops, and the game dies, how much is your collection worth?  *seems people hate the thought of their favorite game dying, so there's that."
mtgmarketwatch,39hw9j,mewcuss,4,Fri Jun 12 08:23:42 2015 UTC,"Once the mtg bubble pops, and the game dies, how much is your collection worth?   While prices could severely devalue, the games not dying any time soon. In fact, it's currently growing and is the biggest it's ever been (based on sales, tournament attendence, etc). It won't die if only because it's a cash cow for hasboro and they will keep supporting for at least a while. It's also not happening because even if hasboro stopped supporting it many of the MILLIONS (?) of players world wide would still play, even if popularity would severely wain.  My final vote of confidence in the game is that if homelands/fallen empires didn't kill the game, then nothing will. :)"
mtgmarketwatch,39hw9j,aloofone,3,Fri Jun 12 09:56:24 2015 UTC,"""Financiers"" don't like hoarding, once a card spikes, they sell their copies. Financiers' goal is to buy undervalued cards and hold them until their market value is corrected, either naturally(through steady growth of demand) or unnaturally(through a buyout).  I would imagine very few copies of Blood Moon are being held by financiers with a $60 price tag. They probably own a lot more $15 Spellskites."

mtgmarketwatch,39g1cp,C_Terror,11,Thu Jun 11 14:05:13 2015 UTC,Yeah this looks more like the incident with Zendikar fetch lands at this point.  The initial increase was justified but it's becoming artificially inflated now and will probably dwindle down soon when fewer people decide it's worth it to buy into Twin.
mtgmarketwatch,39g1cp,NevPicasso,9,Thu Jun 11 14:15:07 2015 UTC,Its not necessarily being artificially inflated.  A lot of people are looking for snaps before Charlotte and there are also a lot of other people seeing snap rise and want to get theirs before it gets to high.    It should slow down after the GP but I dont see the price dropping.
mtgmarketwatch,39g1cp,Little_Gray,0,Thu Jun 11 15:56:28 2015 UTC,"not necessarily artificially    right. but inflating? Yes. Two posts up, /u/NevPicasso mentions the fetch land trajectory prior/during GP Modern last year, which was up then down but then up again.  The usefulness of this info is that a dip may be coming, followed by a longer normal progression upwards to meet $70 yet again."

mtgmarketwatch,39g1cp,robsetsfire,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:40:42 2015 UTC,"Beyond specifically trading into duals, I don't see the same effect happening. Brainstorm is a fun card to play with, but it becomes less fun when 82% of all legacy decks are also playing with it."
mtgmarketwatch,39g1cp,Rock-swarm,3,Fri Jun 12 17:48:23 2015 UTC,"I disagree, it's a 4 of in decks that use it and it see's play in a ton of decks across Modern and a touch in Legacy.  The fact that it was so low for so low is crazy to me, I really think it'll breach $110-120 and hold there."

I usually use ChannelFireball since their service is great (they recently gave me an upgraded price as their buylist for some cards had increased after I sent my order).   If not, what would be a good place to get rid of them?  Also, if anyone on this forum is interested in trading, let me know.

If you still have your doubts... sell the amount that will get you back three things :  Your investment ...   A reasonable amount of staples... to play...  A reasonable amount of new specs...

mtgmarketwatch,39g1cp,devin93uk,6,Thu Jun 11 16:46:30 2015 UTC,That is because MKM is about twenty times the size of TCGPlayer.  More sellers means more competition and lower prices.  Its also a consolidation of the  market which leads to less misinformation about prices and panic buying which in turn increases prices.
mtgmarketwatch,39g1cp,Little_Gray,2,Thu Jun 11 16:57:36 2015 UTC,"The main reason is that EUR has lost ~30% against the USD over the past year or so, and prices have not yet fully converged. Unfortunately MKM doesn't provide usable historical data, but the difference was much smaller a few months ago."
mtgmarketwatch,39g1cp,MR01,3,Thu Jun 11 17:08:59 2015 UTC,Except that historically singles have been universally cheaper in Europe.
mtgmarketwatch,39g1cp,Little_Gray,0,Thu Jun 11 17:20:22 2015 UTC,"Ahh ok, thanks"
mtgmarketwatch,39g1cp,devin93uk,2,Thu Jun 11 16:59:50 2015 UTC,"My two cents:  At this point the price is continuing to rise due to people who intend to play the card, not speculators. I agree with others saying it's a panic buy under the assumption ""It'll only be more expensive if I wait"".    As of 10:50 this morning, there were 139 non-foil copies on TCGplayer: 9 playsets below $80, 6 playsets from $80-$90, 17.5 playsets from $90-$100, and 2 playsets at over $100.  That being said, I expect the price to stabilize in the mid 90s, maybe going as high as $100 but not higher.  Then the price will dip slightly back into the 80s as speculators dump their surplus but nothing drastic.  From there I guess it depends on how it fairs in GPs to come but I don't expect it to ever hit $50 again."
mtgmarketwatch,39g1cp,nathanmasse,8,Thu Jun 11 15:00:57 2015 UTC,Saying it will never hit $50 again is a bit drastic don't you think?  It will certainly be reprinted at some point and likely as a rare.  Snapcaster is a rare in a post-mythic set so it's not like the supply is minuscule.  His price is demand-based so it relies on decks like Twin being very popular in order to maintain this price tag.
mtgmarketwatch,39g1cp,NevPicasso,4,Thu Jun 11 15:27:25 2015 UTC,"Too many decks play him, hes more played than goyf. Blue is not going away and he's a power house in modern legacy and he is somewhat vintage playable.   I think he becomes a chase card in some future printing like ftv or more likely mm3 (drop clique and confidant on the next go around and use snapcaster and liliana)"
mtgmarketwatch,39g1cp,rp_1,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:32:30 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's drastic but with the unspoken assumption was that if modern/legacy remains at least as popular as they are now.  Any sizable reprint (assuming it's not in Origins, which I highly doubt) will likely be in another 2 years in MM3 and that is a very long time for a card of it's popularity not to rise higher.    The thing about Snapcaster and Goyf is that they're such powerful cards because they doesn't rely on any particular deck for its value (like Karn, Mox Opal, Azusa, etc.) and they're both very splashable.  It doesn't have a real drawback like Dark Confidant does, i.e. with the rise of burn as tier 1 the lifeloss from Bob proved unfeasible and that's why it's price was tanking even before the reprint."
mtgmarketwatch,39g1cp,nathanmasse,2,Thu Jun 11 15:33:32 2015 UTC,"I don't think Snapcaster is quite the same as Tarmogoyf in how little it asks of you though.  Snapcaster requires you to have already played an instant or sorcery already that you are fine with paying 2 extra mana to cast.  Otherwise he is a 2/1 for 2.  It's not a drawback, like you said.  But it's not an auto-include in every deck that touches blue either.  It's at its best in decks like twin and delver where you really just want to flashback a one-drop for value.  Tarmogoyf just asks you to play any cards at all."
mtgmarketwatch,39g1cp,NevPicasso,2,Thu Jun 11 15:52:49 2015 UTC,"Well Goyf isn't an auto-include in every green deck: Scapeshift doesn't play it, Bloom Titan doesn't play it, RG Tron doesn't play it.  Both are made weak by graveyard hate and generally require support cards for full effect.    In any case, I was just pointing out that neither are bound by a specific deck or even a specific archetype.  If Abzan gets some hardcore hate the price of Goyf isn't going to change much because it's 'diversified' in many other decks.  The same is true of Snapcaster."

In no way am I trying to sound jerky, but how is that different than things needed to already be in the graveyard before Tarmogoyf gets larger?  I understand your opponent can also be included, but still, things need to also be cast or you get an 0/1 for 2."
mtgmarketwatch,39g1cp,earthbinder,2,Thu Jun 11 18:05:52 2015 UTC,No offense taken.  I guess my first comment was not very clear.  Both cards require you to play other cards in order to be good.  The difference is that Snapcaster requires the other cards that you played to be good both when you first cast them and when you are casting Snapcaster.  Tarmogoyf doesn't really care what the other cards did as long as they are in your graveyard or put cards in your opponent's graveyard.

The management of MTG and it's secondary market prices and the expectations of its consumers is consistent and is profitable for everyone on the supply chain.  However, recent trends shows a slight change akin to the boom in the 90s.  Not on the level of newspapers page-1-ing Action Comics #1 going for $500k causing public interest.  It's more of a mild mass awareness of the consumers and retailers of how this product market works and a panic-buy, simple as that."

mtgmarketwatch,39hjf3,150crawfish,8,Thu Jun 11 19:27:56 2015 UTC,To be honest giest is good against certain decks.  If more and more decks become less creature based and more spell based then Giest will become more popular.  However in the current meta there are a ton of creature based decks out there so Giest isn't going to be that popular anytime soon.  That's from my experience.
mtgmarketwatch,39hjf3,macleod2486,3,Thu Jun 11 19:44:35 2015 UTC,"There will be more creature based decks once Tarmogoyfs become more readily available. So I think creature based decks are here to stay. But, I could see geist becoming more popular if someone were to hype up bogles type decks with geist in it."
mtgmarketwatch,39hjf3,GosuMagic,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:17:42 2015 UTC,"Yup and if anyone is wondering why Geist is terrible against creature decks look at it's stats.  It's a B/W 2/2 hexproof that shoots out a token that only lasts one turn.  A simple goblin can easily block it, kill it off, and at the worst the defender takes 4 points of damage.    Whereas for spells it's hexproof ability is way more potent and becomes a way more tougher target to deal with."
mtgmarketwatch,39hjf3,macleod2486,-2,Fri Jun 12 15:52:29 2015 UTC,"That's why I said before the meta shifts, while Giest is still at a low lol.

mtgmarketwatch,39hjf3,macleod2486,3,Thu Jun 11 20:02:48 2015 UTC,To be honest I am not quite sure about that.  There would have to be some major change done in origins to shift away from creature decks.    In my own opinion geist did have it's day but it being only in specific decks and in a creature heavy format that ain't changing anytime soon.  I honestly wouldn't buy them up at this moment.

That's a world of difference because you can always get a bad draw but you'll at least be able to setup your next draw and in the modern world you can win or lose by a turn.  Dig through time, treasure cruise, preordain, and ponder are all can trips because you have way more consistency in both just sheer draw power and also stacking your deck both before you draw and in the coming turns afterwards."
mtgmarketwatch,39hjf3,twilightwolf90,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:49:25 2015 UTC,"A cantrip is a spell that draws a singular card. Period. Dig Through Time and Treasure Cruise are card filtering and drawing spells respectively. Serum Visions, Manamorphose, and Gitaxian Probe are cantrips, albeit the order is different than normal for Serum Visions. I was talking about the possibility of a new card similar to Serum Visions, or rather Preordain, that Magic Origins would bring because Scry is a confirmed Evergreen mechanic. Obviously, the DCI/WotC believe that Preordain is broken in Modern, but it is possible that a lesser one wouldn't be."
mtgmarketwatch,39hjf3,TravvyJ,2,Fri Jun 12 16:36:26 2015 UTC,"The only way I see Geist gaining real traction anytime in the near future is if there is a bant Collected Company strategy that fits into the meta. However, I have a feeling that nothing in Origins is going to push the archetype over the top in Modern.   Perhaps buy in in a few months and keep your fingers crossed for something great for UW to be printed in Battle for Zendikar?"

It spiked a few months ago and hasn't come down yet, it's not seeing that much play, Geist, as a threat, is weak against much of the meta (Abzan, Tron, and even Burn can deal with it relatively easily).  I wouldn't touch it unless you really wanted to play it in a deck, otherwise, there are much more profitable specs in my opinion."

Seriously, you shouldn't give people advice. You seem to confuse having a baseless speculative opinion with offering informed and intelligent counsel.  If a card dominates format it will get banned, this isn't that. This is talking out of your ass."

As it is still relatively new, it may not have found it's ""best"" build yet, and may wind up being found in multiple build until it does.   And, actually, as other people have denoted... some comparisons can be drawn. Is it those exact cards... no. However, there is the potential for something like that to happen. Has it happened yet? No. However, if you see that happen, you may miss the ship... that's the way the ""finance"" game works so to speak. Sure, there will likely be a window to ""get out."" However, this is a discussion that should be put out there.   Is it Pod? No. Is it GSZ? No. However, some of the ""issues"" that Wizards had with those cards could become present with this. It may very well not happen... and if people want to go full bore and load up, that's their choice (obviously). That said, when Pod was banned... people seemingly lost their minds. People need to be mindful that a CoCo deck could wind up with the same result if such results present themselves.   This is preemptive. That is all. You can see it anyway you want, but I would hope that you could actually do so with some level of respect. To each their own I guess."
mtgmarketwatch,39mbjq,Little_Gray,7,Fri Jun 12 22:17:09 2015 UTC,"No its not the same as Birthing Pod or GSZ.  The card is very different and far more limiting.

mtgmarketwatch,39mbjq,Smotchkkiss,-10,Fri Jun 12 19:25:59 2015 UTC,"That's fine if it makes me look crazy. If it does take off and does wind up banned... will I still look crazy? I'm not saying that is absolutely going to happen... but it could. And, there isn't another card that has the potential. It has too many possible similarities to cards that have been banned in the format (right or wrong, they're still banned... and WotC has given their reason as to why) to not be aware of this.   Why this is being discussed... not Chord... is because Chord can't go into just any deck. This card is far more easily splashed. Again, we've already seen this deck in Blue decks. I've seen it ran with Merfolk (not necessarily a ""OMG end of the world"" scenario... but WotC keeps an eye on this type of thing... they don't want a single card being in ""every"" deck)."

Watch out for that.  On another note... The very first link to MTGStocks shows decks that are using Finks... Thought that was obvious. What wasn't obvious to people a few days ago was CFB getting on board with a high volume buylist. That is sooo much more important than any other factor.

Everyone thought the price of cards like Kitchen Finks (many other cards) wouldn't increase in price... They thought they would stay flat...  That was wrong due to pent-up, Delayed Demand. The ""old"" price was when less people wanted them. The ""new"" price is a reaction to everyone deciding to buy playsets of cards that weren't reprinted, all in a short time-frame. You can apply this general concept to almost any popular card people had on their ""Buylist"", but were waiting to see if it got reprinted before buying in.  The card didn't get reprinted... Everyone that was waiting is buying in all at once... Card goes up in price due to increased demand..."

It also is a card that single-handedly can lock opponents out of the game, which EE just isn't capable of. The power level of Blood Moon is on a whole different level."

I don't know if this card has much more room to grow.  Maybe it could settle out near the pre MM1 price for the original printing, around $16-$17.  It certainly is not going to have anything close to Blood Moon trajectory.  I'm just glad I finished my play set last a few weeks ago because I thought an increase was likely.  If you want a card that is even a small player in modern that is not in MM15, and has not spiked, get it now.  They are going no where but up."

Keep in mind, that if she is in standard, she still probably wont go much below $50. I honestly would say there is nothing wrong with getting them now if you intend to get $200 worth of entertainment from them over the next two years (because at minimum she will be in the next Modern Masters)"
mtgmarketwatch,39el8b,KangaRod,2,Thu Jun 11 05:31:23 2015 UTC,"If she gets reprinted outside of Standard, how would that affect the price? What different avenues does WotC have to reprint her outside of Standard?"

mtgmarketwatch,39el8b,Little_Gray,3,Thu Jun 11 05:43:01 2015 UTC,"This is all just my opinion, I think most people would agree with me that she won't be in anything supplementary, but then again who knows what wonky plans Wizards has up their sleeves.   I feel like she can be printed in Standard again because on her own she's not that incredible. If she were in Standard right now, she'd be played in almost every tier 1 deck, and some type of mono black or Bx would likely become a tier 1 deck... what with Thoughtsieze, fetches and Urborg to ensure BB by turn 3, Nykthos and Gray Merchant, etc. She'd be very powerful in the current Standard environment. They just need to ensure that when they reprint her, she won't be viable in practically every single deck, which is sorta easy for them to regulate since it's dependent on what else they're putting out"
mtgmarketwatch,39el8b,GuruMan88,2,Thu Jun 11 05:56:13 2015 UTC,They want to print her in standard.  They tried in M15 but she was far to powerful.  That means its likely they will keep testing.
mtgmarketwatch,39el8b,Little_Gray,3,Thu Jun 11 13:34:11 2015 UTC,"It wasn't that she was too powerful for standard overall, but too powerful for a standard environment that had an extremely strong mono black deck led by Pack Rat and Thoughtseize."

mtgmarketwatch,39el8b,foldingcouch,2,Thu Jun 11 18:51:33 2015 UTC,"I agree.   I'm basing my opinion on the fact that they said they wanted to put her in standard over the last year, and R&D said that ""right now"" is not a good time.   Namely because she would've been in black with thoughtseize and pack rat.   I could see her coming in the set that boots Khans out of standard....

There's a pretty hard cap below $40 for a mythic and $20 for a rare. Even with nothing other than Voice of Resurgence of value in DGM it still dropped under $40 after just three months. And that's pretty much the worst-case scenario, with there being only a single money card in the set."

That's still a difference of less than $200 from their value today to then, which is the number I assumed would be getting burned on getting a good solid couple years of enjoyment out of playing with Lilly"
mtgmarketwatch,39el8b,Atheist-Gods,9,Fri Jun 12 10:35:07 2015 UTC,(thus about 8 times more rare)    That's not how it works at all.  It's approximately twice as rare.

Could you maybe explain why this is?  What you say makes sense when I think about it (8 is just too much, since there are less mythics than rares), but I can't really explain why it is in my head. Why is it always 2x?"
mtgmarketwatch,39el8b,Little_Gray,6,Thu Jun 11 05:29:36 2015 UTC,"You have a 1/8 probability of opening a mythic rare.  Innistrad has 16 mythic rares.  Therefore, the odds of opening Liliana are (1/8)*(1/16)=1/128, or .78125%.  You also have a 7/8 probability of opening a regular rare.  Innistrad has 59 of these.  Thus, the probability you open a given rare (e.g., Snapcaster Mage) is (7/8)*(1/59)=(7/472), or about 1.48305%.  Based on these probabilities, a regular rare occurs 1.8983 times more often than a mythic rare, making Liliana ""approximately twice as rare"" as Snapcaster."
mtgmarketwatch,39el8b,jimini-christmas,7,Thu Jun 11 05:40:43 2015 UTC,Each pack had 1/121 for 15 mythics and 2/121 for  53 rares. DFC was a separate slot that also had 1/121 chance for Garruk and 2/121 chance for the rares. ISD packs had more mythics/rares due to the DFC slot.

mtgmarketwatch,39blkv,Smotchkkiss,1 point,Thu Jun 11 05:08:27 2015 UTC,Foils are the better buy
mtgmarketwatch,39aomq,NevPicasso,3,Wed Jun 10 13:42:28 2015 UTC,"There is already a ""buyout"" on Abrupt Decays on the MCM.   Today - 315 pieces Yesterday - 369 pieces Last week (sunday, i.e. 4 days ago) - 417 pieces   That means the supply has decreased by 33% in last 4 days.   The interesting side - there is almost no change in the price. Avg price on MCM change from 16.3 to only 16.6 EUR."
mtgmarketwatch,39aomq,mtgainter,4,Wed Jun 10 14:16:46 2015 UTC,A hundred copies selling over a few days does not mean a buyout.  That is only 25 playsets which is not a lot.
mtgmarketwatch,39aomq,Little_Gray,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:55:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah I don't think Abrupt Decay will be susceptible to a buyout for price increase until supply is even lower.  Even 300 copies is still a lot and makes the mid price pretty elastic.  That said, it is an interesting trend that it has moved roughly 100 copies in 4 days.  At the very least it says that there are eyes on this card."
mtgmarketwatch,39aomq,RideTheIguana,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:25:58 2015 UTC,"You mean 25%, not 33%"
mtgmarketwatch,39aomq,Little_Gray,3,Wed Jun 10 16:46:48 2015 UTC,The total number of Jund and Junk decks combined will always be around the same.  When one starts to fall out of favour they move to the other.  This means it has very little effect on the shared staples.
mtgmarketwatch,39aomq,RideTheIguana,2,Wed Jun 10 14:02:18 2015 UTC,"But Junk plays Decay as a 4-of, while Jund plays it as a 2-of"

mtgmarketwatch,39aomq,chanmancan,2,Wed Jun 10 14:14:04 2015 UTC,"Slow growth. RTR printing was pretty massive, so the chances of a true spike are slim. It also seems unlikely to get a reprint before MM2017."
mtgmarketwatch,39aomq,foldingcouch,2,Wed Jun 10 16:13:49 2015 UTC,It's still a steady gainer.  If the BUG delver deck that did very well in the invitational picks up traction it will be gaining a little faster.
mtgmarketwatch,39aomq,chanmancan,3,Wed Jun 10 15:25:32 2015 UTC,"I agree that this is the logical trajectory for the card, but the market is getting increasingly volatile post MM15, and people are going to start rushing staples before they spike.  Abrupt Decay is a prime card for people to panic-buy ""before it's too late."""

mtgmarketwatch,39aomq,price122290,2,Wed Jun 10 19:39:13 2015 UTC,"The card has been gaining a few cents everyday. The lowest copies on tcg are drying up, with the tcg low going from sub-10 to 13 in under a week.   You might not get 500% returns on this, but it seems extremely safe to at least turn profit on any copies that you can get at or below tcg low.  Full disclosure for the sake of context: I have been buying Decays aggressively and am currently holding approximately 100 copies."
mtgmarketwatch,39aomq,Brawler_1337,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:15:10 2015 UTC,"Additional thoughts, being an all-star in modern and legacy means this will always be in demand.   It is also fairly safe from reprint, as we're a year out from it being possible for MM3, and would not be particularly healthy in standard"
mtgmarketwatch,39aomq,REWORD_EVERYTHING,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:17:25 2015 UTC,"I definitely am keeping an eye on Abrupt Decay. I want to get at least one copy for my cube.  Right now, the card really has nowhere to go but up. The card is ubiquitous in Modern, Legacy, and Vintage, and it has the Tiny Leaders appeal of the ""CMC 3 or less"" drawback (though TL has been relatively silent as of late). I would not be surprised if a buyout happens sooner or later, given what's been going on with just about every other Modern playable lately. But even if that doesn't happen, Abrupt Decay will go up slowly over time until it is finally reprinted."
mtgmarketwatch,39aomq,tdaharsh,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:40:11 2015 UTC,Steady slow growth for a while. More modern players from MM15 = more demand

mtgmarketwatch,398lgr,mtd14,2,Wed Jun 10 01:12:44 2015 UTC,Thanks for posting this.  Currently building a foil Grixis Twin deck and to be honest while I really didn't want to pick up the foil Deceivers 'til the end I figured it would be better to pull the trigger now than wait til they're like $30. I guess I'll have to wait on the foil Remands and Cryptic Commands then.
mtgmarketwatch,398lgr,Encendi,2,Wed Jun 10 03:23:40 2015 UTC,Gah. i was thinking of buying a playset just a week or two ago. should've acted sooner
mtgmarketwatch,398lgr,ahriik,2,Wed Jun 10 03:42:37 2015 UTC,Seems silly that this card is going to cost more than Gitaxian probe. I believe Gitaxian Probe probably sees far more play and I imagine there are fewer in print. Since its just the FNM and the pack versions vs Pack + CMD14. There has to be more copies of CMD14 of Deceiver than FNM copies of Gitaxian probe
mtgmarketwatch,398lgr,KidJustice,2,Wed Jun 10 06:46:08 2015 UTC,Deceiver Exarch is an uncommon and not a common in the same set.  I can't imagine their initial print run is anywhere near the same
mtgmarketwatch,398lgr,Phrost_,0,Wed Jun 10 10:51:14 2015 UTC,"True, but I imagine C14 made it even. The difference is though, I imagine gitaxian probe sees far more play."
mtgmarketwatch,398lgr,KidJustice,2,Wed Jun 10 14:29:14 2015 UTC,I doubt there are that many C14 copies of Deceiver Exarch. There's more than one True-Name Nemesis for every C14 Deceiver Exarch (since the TNN deck was printed more).
mtgmarketwatch,398lgr,asmodeanreborn,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:40:06 2015 UTC,Sorry its Commander 13 not 14. I don't know why I thought it was 14.
mtgmarketwatch,398lgr,KidJustice,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:42:59 2015 UTC,"Well, I made the same mistake, so no worries. Either way, there are actually not that many C13 copies of Deceiver Exarch out there as you'd think. :)"
mtgmarketwatch,398lgr,asmodeanreborn,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:46:03 2015 UTC,"There has to be more copies of CMD14 of Deceiver than FNM copies of Gitaxian probe   Those CMD copies are mostly ""dead"" though, they aren't on the market.

mtgmarketwatch,398lgr,stravant,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:08:39 2015 UTC,"It's pretty bad in the deck. Once a new EDH player realizes this, they take it out of the deck and probably put it in a trade binder."
mtgmarketwatch,398lgr,pi-i-e,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:59:14 2015 UTC,and probably put it in a trade binder.   Do you think that's likely? Even as far as highly playable uncommons go I rarely if ever see them in trade binders. AFAIK they usually just rot in people's bulk.
mtgmarketwatch,398lgr,stravant,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:16:20 2015 UTC,"It depends on their knowledge of the game and their friend group, but if they see it's a $2 (now $5) card then yeah I think they would."

mtgmarketwatch,398lgr,Encendi,1 point,Wed Jun 10 04:44:57 2015 UTC,The foils won't spike like that because it was a common both times and has 2 foil printings instead of 1
mtgmarketwatch,398lgr,Phrost_,1 point,Wed Jun 10 10:50:21 2015 UTC,I don't see a huge spike but I can see it maybe reaching $10.
mtgmarketwatch,398lgr,Encendi,2,Thu Jun 11 03:03:32 2015 UTC,Highly unlikely.  Its a common that was in modern masters.  There is a ton of them and foils around.
mtgmarketwatch,398lgr,Little_Gray,1 point,Wed Jun 10 12:34:50 2015 UTC,No. It's a common that was reprinted at common in MM1.

mtgmarketwatch,395utr,Radouf,3,Tue Jun 9 20:26:16 2015 UTC,It's already up by 20% today. All the Jund cards are spiking in the wake of that Columbus Open where five of the top 32 decks were Jund and only one of them was Junk.

mtgmarketwatch,395utr,Rock-swarm,2,Tue Jun 9 20:01:44 2015 UTC,"Wolves are badass, and so are lives. I see Huntmaster in a lot of casual builds and it has the other benefits you mention as well.    That said, I think along with there being an obvious buyout, people are starting to realize just how powerful Olivia can be under the right circumstances, and that's a big part of this prolonged spike. I'm not sure Huntmaster can shut down entire decks the way Olivia can if he gets to stay on the table."
mtgmarketwatch,395utr,asmodeanreborn,3,Tue Jun 9 15:42:47 2015 UTC,"As someone who plays a Jund variant in modern: Huntmaster is a powerhouse, and he functions in 3 different ways in the deck:     He's a ""litmus test"" type card.Every so often, even in competitive tournaments, you'll get a matchup against random brews. Huntmaster is one of those cards that is powerful enough that random tier 2/3 decks are going to struggle with beating him, and unchecked he'll run them over.    He wins the Jund mirror. Liliana often becomes a focal point of the mirror, and he blanks an opposing Liliana all by himself. He's also the 2nd best topdeck you can get in the deck (behind Olivia), simply because you have an incredibly easy time flipping him late game.   He gives the deck another angle of attack. Generally Jund plays from a very non-linear gameplan of ""play the best spells"", and that usually results in a deck that plays out 1 or 2 creatures at a time while getting both players to a low card count, then outvaluing your opponents. Huntmaster actually allows the deck to go wide in certain matchups thanks to the additional bodies he can produce, which adds a dimension the deck usually lacks.     Overall, the card is a powerhouse, and while he's been a card that many people have opted out on, I expect he's going to become a staple in the archetype for a good while."
mtgmarketwatch,395utr,Snow_Regalia,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:25:02 2015 UTC,"I suppose I just don't play enough competitive Modern to have come up against Huntmaster more than a few times. When I play, it's typically a Necrotic Ooze combo deck, and I think I'd be far more worried about Olivia (something I haven't run into either) than Huntmaster. Then again, that's just my particular deck, and having my creatures stolen rather than killed is a far bigger concern."
mtgmarketwatch,395utr,asmodeanreborn,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:37:18 2015 UTC,"Spot-on analysis. I've been playtesting a lot vs Jordan Boisvert's RUG Delver that packs the full set of Huntmasters, to grind postboard. On any deck I may be, Huntmaster is a scary card to face, and a tough one to answer."

It isn't high impact like Olivia, who is an actual good card starting on the right amount open mana. Huntmaster does a lot, but doesn't do enough to close out games.   However, the secondary market is fucked and the small set printing of a double faced card tells me yeah, this guy is going sky high, for no good reason at all."

mtgmarketwatch,395g5u,ardeay,2,Tue Jun 9 14:28:04 2015 UTC,Original print foils have quite a bit of price insulation as well.  I think 30 for foil Tar Pits is a fine investment.
mtgmarketwatch,395g5u,bfro,4,Tue Jun 9 15:12:48 2015 UTC,I wonder about the reprint risk in Zendi 2: Electric Boogalo. It seems like the obvious thing for Wotc to do is finish the cycle and make the enemy manlands. Would they put in 5 fetches and a 10 cycle of manlands in 2 sets?
mtgmarketwatch,395g5u,jassi007,2,Tue Jun 9 13:05:31 2015 UTC,Aren't there only 5 Zendikar manlands?  Printing a cycle of allied manlands and then a cycle of enemy fetchlands would keep it balanced for standard.
mtgmarketwatch,395g5u,bfro,0,Tue Jun 9 15:11:43 2015 UTC,"Right. I'm saying I predict we won't get all reprints for the rare lands, I suspect we get both enemy fetches and enemy manlands. I also suspect we get some allied land cycle in Origins. So when rotation hits we'll probably have 5 allied fetches, 5 allied something from Origins, and 5 enemy fetches. Then when set 2 hits we probably get enemey manlands. So we have exactly 10/10 allied/enemy lands."
mtgmarketwatch,395g5u,jassi007,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:37:15 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure they'll reprint the allied pains in Origins

mtgmarketwatch,394j71,Rock-swarm,3,Tue Jun 9 05:47:16 2015 UTC,Using discard to pick apart their hand allows you to get to a point where Oiliva allows you to prevent Amulet for playing titans. Also Amulet can only hit you for 20 with double amulet up so the play can work over the course of 2 turns in most cases.

mtgmarketwatch,398cmt,Radouf,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:15:35 2015 UTC,"""Pump and dump"" (P&D) is a form of microcap stock fraud that involves artificially inflating the price of an owned stock through false and misleading positive statements, in order to sell the cheaply purchased stock at a higher price. Once the operators of the scheme ""dump"" sell their overvalued shares, the price falls and investors lose their money. Stocks that are the subject of pump and dump schemes are sometimes called ""chop stocks"".  While fraudsters in the past relied on cold calls, the Internet now offers a cheaper and easier way of reaching large numbers of potential investors.   Not saying this is your intention at all, but it sure could look like it from someone else's perspective, you know. Which is probably why you are getting this reaction."

mtgmarketwatch,392yii,4theWlN,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:08:55 2015 UTC,"What is the distinction between rotation and ""end of its draft life""?  Doing a quick look it seems most sets between Theros up to Dragons of Tarkir are around $220 to as much as $500. Return to Ravnica block is even more expensive since they've been out of print. The exception seems to be Dragon's Maze, a set with an exceptionally low expected value, can be found for under $200 even now.  I suppose i should expect entire foil sets to fall within that $220 to $500 range while they are in print, and slowly climb up as they leave rotation."
mtgmarketwatch,392yii,4theWlN,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:19:31 2015 UTC,"rotation is based on standard, draft life (imo) is when we stop drafting it at weekly drafts so far fewer packs are opened weekly."

Snap is both one of the best AND most fun cards in the most played color in legacy, modern and EDH. I expect snap's to raise to 100$ before the end of this year. Am I investing in snapcaster mages? If I had the money I actually would and buy some playsets for 200-220euro and flip them in a couple of months for 300-350. The Foil multiplier on most modern staples is most of the time around 3-3.5x so IMO 150$ was way too low for the foils."

mtgmarketwatch,38ykf6,arramdaywalker,0,Mon Jun 8 19:39:59 2015 UTC,Was actually having a twitter conversation with SigFig8 about this. Similar cards have a higher multiplier on the foils (3x versus 2.5x). Looks like someone decided to bite the bullet and move the market.  My guess is that it settles around 190-200.
mtgmarketwatch,38ykf6,arramdaywalker,-1,Sun Jun 7 23:10:21 2015 UTC,"Well that 3x multiplier only matters if the non foil price stays high right? When snap was $30 a few months ago I remember the foils being about $100 (there's that 3x multiplier) but as the price on non-foils went up, the foils stayed the same. Do you think that if the non-foils come down, the foils will come down as well?"
mtgmarketwatch,38ykf6,arramdaywalker,1 point,Sun Jun 7 23:13:23 2015 UTC,"I think that the non-foils lagged behind the meteoric rise of the non-foils and this is a natural price correction.   If, for some reason, the non-foils dropped the foils would also likely drop, but they'd likely drop slower. But, short of a reprinting in origins or BFZ, I doubt it'll drop meaningfully."
mtgmarketwatch,38ykf6,Manadyne,-1,Sun Jun 7 23:30:12 2015 UTC,But why now are these spiking so much. Yes it's very popular but most people playing legacy probably already have the ones they need and barely any are entering that format.

mtgmarketwatch,38wt4k,REWORD_EVERYTHING,12,Sun Jun 7 14:35:51 2015 UTC,"I'll focus on abrupt decay vs snapcaster mage since I feel like I understand it more.  They serve different purposes.  Snapcaster mage has a few advantages over the average blue card.  It reclaims and reuses cards and is on color with some of the best spells in the game.  It also requires 1 color to work.  Abrupt decay is a different card.  Highly efficient, two-color removal.  That is highly desirable and I don't see it disappearing anytime soon.  The difference is that it isn't the only thing that does its job well enough in modern.  Terminate is a highly favored Jund removal piece that also is efficient.  It hits more creatures, but is vulnerable to counterspells.  With that in mind, there just isn't a card that is as unique of a card as snapcaster.  A card to be the next snapcaster would need this criteria(according to me):   Highly unique function Modern playable Playable using only one color Not meta dependent   Abrupt decay gets much worse if the meta has very few legal targets(this hasn't happened, but if a Tron deck starts to explode, or what have you...).  So no, I don't think a removal piece is going to be the ""next snapcaster mage"".  I think it is better to look at the creatures with powerful effects.  Instead of the explosive spec, look at the easy specs.   Shocklands(these have been slowly climbing since RTR rotated out and won't return for likely 4 years minimum) Fetchlands(people always need them) Eidolon of the Great Revel(good burn is hard to come by) Thoughtseize(multi-format staple, easy to hold and watch them grow) All the Charms(one of a kind, easy commander/fringe modern spec) Seige Rhino(Junk's best 4 drop) Loxodon Smiter(any resurgance of hatebears makes this guy spike) Collected Company(its only going to get more expensive) Monastery Swiftspear Soulfire Grandmaster is super low compared and it still may break into modern later.  Probly safe to pick up Tasigur(delver delver delver) Monastery Mentor Commands   Just watch the cheap, easy specs, not chase the next 1000% payoff.  I garuntee you, in a year, shocks will be at least +4 dollars of their current positions, with the overgrown tomb, stomping ground, and steam vents being the best specs"

mtgmarketwatch,38wt4k,stitches_extra,2,Mon Jun 8 17:01:44 2015 UTC,"Great analysis.  The only thing I would add with regards to Snapcaster vs Decay is that Decay came from a much more heavily opened set, so there are many more copies out there."
mtgmarketwatch,38wt4k,Gordonuts,2,Sun Jun 7 20:22:21 2015 UTC,"Is this true? Honest question, I haven't played in a while"
mtgmarketwatch,38wt4k,Gordonuts,5,Sun Jun 7 22:01:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah. At the time, Return to Ravnica was the most opened set of all time. This is due to a couple of factors: the game was reaching an all time high in popularity; Ravnica was a fan favorite plane, so people were hyped to go back; and the set contained Shocklands, which were in the $20-$30 range before reprinting, and were in high demand from Modern. The set also contained some major eternal staples like Abrupt Decay and Deathrite Shaman. All this culminated in a lot of packs being opened. Subsequently, there are quite a few Abrupt Decays out there, many more than there are Snapcaster Mages."
mtgmarketwatch,38wt4k,worldchrisis,1 point,Sun Jun 7 22:13:13 2015 UTC,"RTR got opened a ton because it had Shocklands, DRS, Sphinx's Rev, etc.   That said, every Fall set for the last several years has been the most opened set of all time."

mtgmarketwatch,38wt4k,devin93uk,6,Sun Jun 7 22:00:48 2015 UTC,"I would argue that Abrupt Decay hasn't really 'spiked'. It's seen  natural growth due to high demand from multiple formats, and it probably will continue to until reprinted."
mtgmarketwatch,38wt4k,mistercimba,3,Sun Jun 7 22:15:06 2015 UTC,That's exactly what I am thinking.
mtgmarketwatch,38wt4k,321orez,2,Sun Jun 7 22:19:21 2015 UTC,"As someone who is new to investing take my opinion with a pinch of salt.  I have also gone pretty deep on abrupt decay and think they are a solid spec for the foreseeable future because solid removal is never bad, even if the meta shifts it won't plummet quickly and the meta can still shift back. Yes it is a solid reprint target and it could be any set but I would be surprised to see it any earlier than the set after battle for zen.  another thing I will say is I can honestly see Snapcaster going up another $50 at least and am looking to buy in a bit, not going nuts because of the high cost of entry but I think it's going to hit $100 at some point.  finally a question to everyone, what do people think on Kologhan's Command as a spec right now for $5.40ish?"
mtgmarketwatch,38wt4k,GrossoGGO,2,Sun Jun 7 22:55:40 2015 UTC,"Keep selling your Snapcasters. I'd say sell the Inkmoths now, as Infect is becoming less of a viable strategy in the current meta (even more now with Kolaghan's Command everywhere). Abrupt Decay will be a $20-$30 card soon. For bulk rotating cards, I feel that you're right with Ashen Rider, not sure about other cards."

mtgmarketwatch,38upbc,asmodeanreborn,1 point,Sun Jun 7 17:10:06 2015 UTC,I'm not certain that the non-foils are a buyout (the foils clearly are).  We've just see Jund get listed as Tier 1 in Modern again for the first time in months.  We've also just seen a new supply of Bob and Goyf introduced to the world via the triple GP.  It's entirely possible that the non-foils are the result of freshly-minted Jund players picking up the rest of the deck.

Foil copies are somewhat few but far from extinct with plenty on TCG, 8 on Amazon, a couple eBay, and various copies on other vendors like CK.   Usually if a card spikes on MTGO before paper, it means that there is some sort of tournament result(s) with it. Since none show up, my only guess is that it was featured at the SCG modern event or some pro is brewing with it. I've been watching Kenji all day not SCG, so can anyone confirm/deny it's been mentioned there?"

Prices will normalize in a few days (for at most) a few dollars above where they were before and your post will look silly. Look at the price graphs of all the Tron lands, they are constantly going up and down as people buy them... An eventual buyout was inevitable as there have been no recent printings of the card.

mtgmarketwatch,38t8rl,Little_Gray,-2,Sun Jun 7 14:42:07 2015 UTC,Not really.  Its a half decent tier two deck that saw an increase in play because of its amazing match up against delver and wasteland seeing less and less play.  Now that cruise is banned the deck is back to being bad.
mtgmarketwatch,38t8rl,worldchrisis,2,Mon Jun 8 14:21:15 2015 UTC,There were 3 MUD decks in the Top 16 of the Legacy PIQ this weekend. It has an excellent matchup against Miracles as well as Delver.
mtgmarketwatch,38t8rl,Blenderhead36,2,Mon Jun 8 18:26:31 2015 UTC,"Brainstorm Brewery has been talking about this card for months.  It's only tournament play is in Legacy MUD.  So, it sees play (admittedly as a 4-of) as a Tier 2 deck in the smallest Constructed format.  I feel like if this thing was going to spike, it would have happened when the Built From Scratch Commander deck came out.  It was an entire deck based around sacrificing artifacts, yet Kuldotha Forgemaster wasn't included.  Despite all of that, it's just over $3.  This thing also has ""Commander reprint,"" written all over it.  Even if it were reprinted elsewhere, it doesn't have any keywords on it and would theoretically be fair game anywhere.  Because of its refusal to move under previous pressure and necessity to move it quick after a spike (because it's so easy to reprint) coupled with low demand, I think that this card is a trap."

mtgmarketwatch,38t8rl,Red_Beam,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:24:54 2015 UTC,Kuldotha Forgemaster has potential as it is a tutor that fits in Legacy MUD and Daretti EDH but demand is otherwise low.    Without a reprint or strictly better card it's going to continue on with small gains as each set becomes known.    The few I bought months ago have yet to rise enough to make selling them worth it and I'm not buying any additional copies at their current price.
mtgmarketwatch,38t8rl,twilightwolf90,-1,Mon Jun 8 22:27:13 2015 UTC,"Scars of Mirrodin was a well opened set. If this becomes popular, I doubt it will crack a few more dollars. Also, it's mainly driven so far as a casual staple. Only Cheerios plays it in Modern so far."

mtgmarketwatch,38mg5y,SaffronOlive,4,Fri Jun 5 10:53:51 2015 UTC,Oracle does something to really change the game though which is why she sees lots of EDH and casual play.  Courser misses the exciting part of what Oracle does.

I think it will go under the radar and significantly drop, which is why I think the ROI will be very good here  Courser : very powerful card like Siege Rhino or Tasigur, except is 1 mana less. I think it's a very playable card which is less visible right now and will appear again later  Gobblin Rabblemaster : not played in modern as Goblins is almost not existing anymore in modern. But I think Goblins will make a comeback one day, and this day you'll be happy to have them. This card will drop a lot and has a good estimated ROI too  Thassa : the best god, played in merfolks and EDH, very low cmc, will be very cheap too at rotation for a mythic  Mana Confluence : will be very cheap at rotation and is a good land, still it's not much played  Chord of Calling : very strong ability, will be very cheap too I think (already is and rotation effect is barely starting)  Brimaz : very low cmc for a nice mythic playe din death & taxes  As for bulk prices :  Phyrexian Revoker was expensive before M15 and is played in 2 different archetypes at least  Anger of the gods => strong removal in sideboards  Spirit of the Labyrinth => I still don't get why this card has never increased ... it will be less than 0.5$ at rotation and I think it will be 5-6x more one day  Ashen Rider : strictly better than Angel of Despair, Mythic and less than 1$ at rotation => pure net value in 1-2 years  Swan Song : one of the cheapest counter-all things, played as sb in decks that rely on their combo a lot, will be <0.5$ too and be at least 4x more one day  BTW : sliver hive is good too, at 1.5/2$ it's not a big risk and it will reach that level"

The limiting factor is this: even with an Enchantment heavy metagame, where a well timed Sage can be a 2-for-1, it's only a 1-2 of in Standard sideboards. If it never gets a Standard reprint, it may eventually rise to the price levels of other Modern sb staples like Stony Silence, but that is highly unlikely IMO."

mtgmarketwatch,38kctr,RudelyOutOfContext,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:40:46 2015 UTC,It's a little more complicated in this particular Standard because of Urborg. Imagine the multiple judge calls at every FNM for the entire summer where they have to try to explain layers.
mtgmarketwatch,38kctr,Jack_Krauser,1 point,Mon Jun 8 03:54:45 2015 UTC,A lot of people would be stunned with a Blood Moon in standard. Its a better pick for the Dual Decks.
mtgmarketwatch,38l5yn,Asstadon,3,Thu Jun 4 22:42:52 2015 UTC,"This is a buyout. I had a very hard time tracking down these foils when I was looking for a couple for my Grixis Delver deck. Fortunately I was able to nab a pair for $3 a piece after hitting refresh on eBay tirelessly before the spike. I would anticipate this price coming down significantly over the next couple of months. It's only played as a two of at most in one Modern deck and a couple of Legacy decks, so it's not like there are multiple decks playing a full playset. $15 foil commons and uncommons tend to demand that price as four-ofs in my experience."
mtgmarketwatch,38l5yn,Valdarith,2,Fri Jun 5 11:54:34 2015 UTC,"A good example is Young Pyro. YP is often a 4-of, is run in a few more decks than angler, was opened less, and is no longer in print. The foils are currently sitting at just under $40. I don't see angler getting over $20 for the forseeable future, and I actually see his price going down a bit unless the standard meta gets a lot friendlier to his existence.  With all of that said, I was certainly glad to pick up my playset at $5 each. He's an easier-to-cast tombstalker, and presents a legitimate wall to tasigur and goyfs in modern.  I would also look at foils of Hooting Mandrills. Aside from the Temur Delver list in modern, Mandrills has potential down the road for many of the same reasons as gurmag angler, and has trample to boot."
mtgmarketwatch,38l5yn,Rock-swarm,0,Sat Jun 6 03:03:57 2015 UTC,Hahaha damn wish I went in on these guys.... I think it's too high. I see it settling around $8 in a month
mtgmarketwatch,3880wf,tk_fourtwentyone,17,Tue Jun 2 14:43:25 2015 UTC,The vendors were offering such high buylist prices that they pretty much cleared out the GP.  They will slowly release them into the market to keep the price high.
mtgmarketwatch,3880wf,Little_Gray,10,Tue Jun 2 14:59:20 2015 UTC,"Sadly, everything I have heard lines up with this. I am expecting a trickle at best onto TCGplayer/eBay over the next week. Unless the remainder of the print run is so large that the market becomes completely saturated and vendors can't vacuum up excess supply I think Friday after release might have been the floor."
mtgmarketwatch,3880wf,RayDonger,15,Tue Jun 2 15:33:12 2015 UTC,"Go to channel fireballs website. Notice how they have 0 mm15 goyfs in stock? Do you think they bought zero at the GP? Or do they not have their inventory updated? There were a bunch of goyfs opened, and some number of them are in various vendors hands. It doesn't look like they're making their way into the market yet, for whatever reasons."
mtgmarketwatch,3880wf,jassi007,6,Tue Jun 2 14:55:16 2015 UTC,To be fair they closed my gamestore(cfb gamecenter) for vegas.  All hands on deck for the GP it would honestly not suprise me if the inventory hasn't made it back to the San Jose warehouse until today
mtgmarketwatch,3880wf,Unknown_Phate,3,Tue Jun 2 16:00:27 2015 UTC,"Right, just saying the prices can't go down if the inventory isn't sorted and updated etc. etc."
mtgmarketwatch,3880wf,jassi007,10,Tue Jun 2 16:02:02 2015 UTC,"It doesn't make sense because most businesses can't just spend many thousands/tens of thousands of dollars and just sit on it. This is a fiction some people like to maintain but the truth is stores need to turn product over. There is an opportunity cost for money. If I pay $100 for card X and can sell it for $120 today, or I think I can sell for $130 30 days from now, the logic seems to be, wait and make more money. It isn't. I'm a store. People bring me cards to buy all the time . I can't logically do this if I don't have cash on hand right?  Take the above example. I sell card X for $120 now. Take my $120 buy another collection, one with card X for $100 and Card Y for 20. Now I sell my second card X for $120, and Card Y for $25. Now I'm up $25. If I can do this several more times in the month, my intial $100 is going to earn me more than the $130 if I set it aside for 30 days. I need to sell things to have money to buy things to sell to make more money and on and on. Stores are almost never, ever better off parking money in stock if they can turn it over and buy more stock."
mtgmarketwatch,3880wf,jassi007,5,Tue Jun 2 16:54:21 2015 UTC,"This is exactly it. CFB was already in a great position due to the sheer volume of side event cash during the GP, so they aren't in any sort of hole for buying a ton of goyfs and nobles to sit on for a bigger return."
mtgmarketwatch,3880wf,Rock-swarm,0,Tue Jun 2 17:02:25 2015 UTC,If they figure in 6m goyf will be $175   you say that like they can just auto-sell their stock. nope.
mtgmarketwatch,3880wf,stitches_extra,7,Tue Jun 2 18:25:12 2015 UTC,"lol rage harder kiddo  glad to hear you know the details of CFB's finances, though"
mtgmarketwatch,3880wf,stitches_extra,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:26:20 2015 UTC,"Thousands/tens of thousands is not all that much money, especially yo a store as large as CFB.  I am not at all saying the conclusion is invalid but the reasoning is flawed. If I personally knew that by spending 10k now I'd get 12k in a month, I'd absolutely do it."
mtgmarketwatch,3880wf,Deathspiral222,7,Wed Jun 3 16:08:47 2015 UTC,"Whether it is thousands, ten thousands, hundred thousands or million is not the point, and you know it.  The point is if you spend 10k today and sit on it for 30 days you make 12k. If you however buy and sell actively in the same 30 days, you can make that 10k into 15k. Stores don't sit on stock, they are constantly buying and selling as much as they can. Stores come to GP's to buy cards more than sell them. This is another thing people generally don't get. They assume ""stores put everything on sale on Sunday so they don't have to lug cards home."" Patently not true. If they didn't want to lug cards home they wouldn't happily take bulk, they wouldn't offer deals for cash to have more cash on hand to buy more, etc. I saw a guy at SCG Baltimore with like a freight cart piled high with card boxes. I'd guess it was easily over 100k cards, probably closer to 200k. He walked out a while later with an empty cart. Stores go to big events to buy cards, because the sum of the players are much greater than their local store. They of course are there to sell too, but Channel Fireball probably does a brisk business through their website. However they probably have issues finding stock of eternal staples, etc. locally on a regular basis. Big events like GP's are how they stock up."
mtgmarketwatch,3880wf,jassi007,2,Wed Jun 3 17:52:52 2015 UTC,"I understand the concept of inventory turnover.  Small, regional stores are likely cash constrained and need to turnover quickly. Larger stores like Starcity and CFB care about turnover, of course, but also have resources to invest for the long-haul. It's not unreasonable to assume that the largest stores have a line of credit of upwards of million dollars or so that they can use if they spot especially good deals on collections.  The idea that CFB ""can't just spend many thousands/tens of thousands of dollars and just sit on it. "" is absolutely false. If they make a future return higher than their present return plus their cost of capital (likely far less than 1% for a month) then they will wait and hold the cards for a month."
mtgmarketwatch,3880wf,Deathspiral222,2,Wed Jun 3 19:21:51 2015 UTC,"Even if they can sit on inventory, if they don't have cards in stock people want to buy shoppers will go elsewhere. turnover is a major factor for most stores, but even if we assume megastores like CFB and SCG were willing to sit on stock, they also need to have what customers want. There are more factors in place that say it is wrong for them to do this than there are for it to be correct.  All that said, you could be correct. If so, fuck them for such gross market manipulation, and if Wizards is ignoring it or complicit in them fuck them too. I have a real hard time believing this is what is actually happening, but it certainly could be possible."
mtgmarketwatch,3880wf,jassi007,4,Tue Jun 2 17:31:55 2015 UTC,Except that they do it all the time.  Large vendors like SCG can afford to sit on stock so they do.  Its fairly normal for them to limit the number of cards they put on their website and increase the stock as they sell.      They also constantly hit up large events which means a lot of their stock never makes it to the website.  It is always on the move between events and only the extras go back to the warehouse.
mtgmarketwatch,3880wf,Little_Gray,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:47:30 2015 UTC,"if they don't have cards in stock people want to buy shoppers will go elsewhere.   Yes, there's also the factor of: being able to say ""we have everything"" gets you sales, and being out of stock loses you sales. This falls under the umbrella of customer service.  In micro, you see this on tcgplayer; the lowest-price vendors often have 1x in stock of something hot, because people will pay a little extra to buy from the store who can sell them their whole list at once, leaving the ""1x""ers behind."
mtgmarketwatch,3880wf,stitches_extra,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:59:30 2015 UTC,"They assume ""stores put everything on sale on Sunday so they don't have to lug cards home.""   OTOH this is true about physically larger items, such as binders, and especially used binders they got from buying collections. Definitely hit up vendors sunday if you need cheap supplies."
mtgmarketwatch,3880wf,stitches_extra,-1,Tue Jun 2 19:39:47 2015 UTC,"It is not thousands. Across all the vendors you are looking at tens of millions in buys/sells at GP Vegas. I don't know what CFBs % is, but I think they had to have bought more than a million in cards this weekend."
mtgmarketwatch,3880wf,americanextreme,2,Tue Jun 2 21:01:20 2015 UTC,"but I think they had to have bought more than a million in cards this weekend.   Uh, no. One largish vendor I am friends with told me he bought $80,000. Which is a lot, but more than an order of magnitude below $1M."
mtgmarketwatch,3880wf,stitches_extra,2,Wed Jun 3 16:13:19 2015 UTC,"I sat down with a couple dealers over the weekend, where I asked the question that got us to the answer that tens of millions would be bought/sold over the weekend. I appreciate your one friends advice but ""Uh, no"".  Ok, so we both have someone telling us numbers. Lets try to understand what they mean. Your dude brought $80K in cash and spent it all on cards. The people I'm talking to spent cash on cards, sold cards, spent more cash on cards, gave store credit, tried to churn, buy and sell. Most large numbers come from the dealer booths, but there are a couple of people out there with collections and binders that are trading with each other, paypaling for power and finding every other way to get what they want out of the weekend.   I think you are referring to the capital that one largish vendor brought with them. I'm more looking at the revenue (NOT PROFIT) for the weekend.  Another  way to look at this. Lets say a Vendor buys a booth ($5K? Rents a truck ($500?), and has 6 employees ($10 an hour for 12 hours, plus $100 hotel/food per night for 5 nights, (120 + 100) * 5 = $1100, $6600 for 6). Right there I see costs of $12000 and I have no clue if I captured even half the iceberg. So they spend $12000 bucks to buy only $80000 in cards? That means they need to turn a profit of ~15% just to break even? Considering some individuals are selling $10K-$20K in cards in a single go, that seems a little low. But lets put that aside.  We have 30 vendors. 30*$80,000 = $2,400,000. So even if we just take your cash number and assume you were talking to the perfectly avertage fish in the pond, we are at ~2.5 Mill in cash in the room. That doesn't count the sales of cards that are used to buy more cards, store credit, nor private buyers and sellers lurking at trade tables far from CFB's ears."
mtgmarketwatch,3880wf,americanextreme,2,Wed Jun 3 16:10:14 2015 UTC,"Well, your sentence was, ""I don't know what CFBs % is, but I think they had to have bought more than a million in cards this weekend.""  Given that, and how antecedents work in English, I read ""they"" as meaning ""CFB's booth, alone"". Which was obviously not doing seven figures. If you meant the entire event as a whole, it's a believable number, but that isn't what you wrote."
mtgmarketwatch,3880wf,stitches_extra,0,Tue Jun 2 18:06:59 2015 UTC,exactly. cash is the bottleneck. there are more good buying opportunities than cash to go around.
mtgmarketwatch,3880wf,stitches_extra,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:15:46 2015 UTC,"Or they could just post them at a higher price than the current going rate, which is probably what they would actually do."
mtgmarketwatch,3880wf,potato1,5,Wed Jun 3 16:51:47 2015 UTC,"Big stores do this all the time, that's why SCG's prices tend to be higher than TCGplayer."
mtgmarketwatch,3880wf,potato1,10,Wed Jun 3 19:32:06 2015 UTC,"Based on the MTGStocks data, it looks like there's a common theme to the rares/mythics price charts -  If it's a 4-of in a competitive deck (opal, noble, goyf, confidant, etc.), it's already rising due to demand of people trying to snag their playsets.  If it's a 1-of, or doesn't have established, competitive, constructed play (Kozilek, Ulamog, bitterblossom, etc.) then it's still at it's lowest, though they will start rising again at some point.  Obviously, there are exceptions to this. V Cliques are down for every printing other than MM2015, largely based on the positive reception of the new art (which is fucking gorgeous). Emrakul is still down despite being a 4-of in some legacy/modern lists, partially because of the promo printing, and partially because he's banned in EDH. Most of the sneak-and-show players already have him, and he was far from the priciest part of buying into that deck.  Primetime is also still down, but this is his 4th printing, and many players are wary of buying into Amulet Bloom for playstyle or skill ceiling reasons.  Personally, I've noticed everyone and their mother suddenly wanting mox opals and noble hierarchs on Pucatrade, and those wants are going unfulfilled right now as the price keeps climbing."
mtgmarketwatch,3880wf,Rock-swarm,4,Wed Jun 3 16:06:52 2015 UTC,"Okay, my math might be way off here, but assuming TCG's email that 88,000 packs were opened at GP, how many Tarmgoyf's were opened?  88,000 / 24 = 3,666 boxes were opened. ?? Chances of Tarmogoyf is 1 in 5 boxes (3 mythics a box, 15 mythics total) 3,666 / 5 = 733 opened 733 / 4 = 183 playsets  I hope those numbers are right.  But, will that many really knock the price down much?"
mtgmarketwatch,3880wf,sleeperx,4,Tue Jun 2 19:27:16 2015 UTC,"Your method is loose, but you got almost exactly the right number! Each pack has a 1/121 shot of opening a Goyf, that's how many cards are on the rare sheet with Goyf on there once. That gives us precisely and estimated 727 Goyfs in 88,000 packs, or 1 cards shy from 182 playsets. And no, I'm not going to even attempt to calculate the standard deviation on that!"

I'm looking at getting a pair of NH's and I expected a few hundred to hit the market after the GP, driving the price down. But the overall quantity on TCG has stayed roughly the same ovet the past few days. And like you said, the prices have only gone up. Most of the other rares have gone down actually, and the NH is behaving like a mythic, which are generally trending upward."

mtgmarketwatch,3880wf,rp_1,2,Tue Jun 2 23:21:52 2015 UTC,looks like a lot of inventory made it to tcgplayer at new prices. They aren't quite old retail but they aren't much cheaper than they were last week. Take Kozelik for example original was 50$ new was listed at 22 now it is 25  the inventory count went up quite a bit in the last few days but at newer prices.
mtgmarketwatch,3880wf,Memoryjar,2,Wed Jun 3 00:09:19 2015 UTC,"I anticipated that this would happen with this set but not for the normals reasons.  The problem with the GP is that those who were attending would have held off on buying high end staples because of the opportunity to open them. It sucks when you buy a set of Goyf, cliques, or hierarches for slightly deflated prices and end up opening up one in a pack. Yes you can trade it away, sometimes easily, but that is hundred's of dollars you shouldn't have spent in the first place.  What this means for the price is that people who went to the GP have been waiting to buy staples and those who didn't are all waiting for the anticipated price drop. As people begin to buy them up realizing that everyone is also waiting the prices will flatline or increase over the next few weeks.   These prices are entirely demand outpacing supply and people waiting for the price to drop before buying in which likely won't happen at this point."

Similar to voice of resurgence or electrolyze, it's just good getting solid cards in multi colours that give players options  I dont think there is any reason to get in at this point.

mtgmarketwatch,383toy,chrisrazor,-2,Mon Jun 1 21:17:42 2015 UTC,"I dont see it sustaining this price. Its a 4 of in one legacy deck that doesn't get a lot of attention. Omni-Tell did get a huge boost with Treasure Cruise and Dig Through Time. TC kid of put the deck over the edge into too good and the deck saw a huge uptick in play. Since the TC ban DTT does a lot of work and puts the deck into one of the top combo decks for sure but doesn't make it a T0 deck by any means. if you look at recent results, Omni-tell is just doing OK. Its not even one of the cheaper legacy decks to buy into for new players. It requires volcanics, Scalding Tarns, FoW, Show and Tell, and other high dollar cards. It's also a hard deck to pilot for sure. If your not already playing Omni-Tell, you probably aren't just going to jump into it. Would you trade one Show and Tell for two Omniscience? I wouldn't.  There really cant be this many people trying to play this legacy deck. The card sees no modern play. It's not even an EDH thing. It also came from M13 that got a lot of packs opened due to Thragtusk and Thundermaw Hellkite. The card can also be reprinted into just about any set that needs another 'safe' junk mythic.  Sell into the hype unless you are already playing legacy omni-tell."

I was looking to grab a playset of most of the mythics and some of the rares but their prices appear to be increasing today."
mtgmarketwatch,381eb9,rp_1,2,Mon Jun 1 23:43:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah I thought it would be decreasing as well, but it still hasn't. Maybe everyone is just opting to sit on their staples instead of selling them off after the event. It's also interesting that the prices of the staples are staying the same or rising, but boosters are down under $210, which I assume is judges rewarded in boxes cashing in."
mtgmarketwatch,381eb9,apaniyam,5,Tue Jun 2 00:50:11 2015 UTC,"Well yes, it is day two of a GP and magic cards are heavy."
mtgmarketwatch,381eb9,apaniyam,3,Mon Jun 1 09:47:26 2015 UTC,I'm sure some people who weren't there and were watching prices do nothing but climb all weekend would enjoy knowing vendors were selling at prices on par with the Friday/Saturday the set was released.
mtgmarketwatch,381eb9,apaniyam,1 point,Mon Jun 1 14:35:26 2015 UTC,"But it's a GP, an enclosed market. It will be 2 weeks before the vendors have all their new stock inventoried and up on TCGplayer."
mtgmarketwatch,381eb9,Little_Gray,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:44:19 2015 UTC,"Vendors certainly don't wait two weeks to get their inventory up. Recalling the stories I've heard on BSB, they get them up very shortly thereafter. As in within a day or two."
mtgmarketwatch,37vxh0,carmansandiego,7,Sat May 30 21:09:55 2015 UTC,"Couple things to know about selling to vendors at a GP:   I highly suggest you make a pile of stuff you wish to be rid of, then catalog it in a spreadsheet. Look up buylist/retail prices for the major dealers (SCG/CFB/Troll and Toad/Strike Zone/Cool Stuff) for your stuff. Clearly this can be time consuming, but I would do it on most stuff worth more than $20. Also check ebay pricing and TCG low. Put all that info in your sheet. This is best done on Thursday/Friday, as the prices are probably locked in until the event starts. Ask yourself what your goal is. If you are looking to pick up cards you need for the event/side events, then store credit can be your friend. If you are looking to pick up stuff that you don't need right away, then I'd take cash. Cash is king, and you can often get more mileage out of cash if you shop online, or you can haggle more effectively at the event if you are looking to pay cash. Note - some vendors don't like to haggle. Do not, under any circumstances, sell your cards to the first vendor you talk to. Especially on higher value cards ($40+). buylist pricing can vary wildly. Bigger vendors like SCG/CFB are going to usually pay less than some other smaller vendors. Smaller vendors model their business on the quick flip, so they might offer higher buylist and sell cards at lower prices. They want to make their money and move on. Big online dealers want to take your goodies back to the warehouse and stock the website. An example of this, when I went to GP Providence 2013, I was looking to unload some revised Duals. I got literally $20-40 over SCG buylist on each Dual at MTG Deals' booth.  Big retailers are primarily there to buy your cards. They want to keep the websites stocked. What they have on display is likely going to be stuff that isn't exactly Near Mint. This can work in your favor if you intend to get cards you need, and don't care if they aren't in perfect condition. As a matter of fact, if you are looking to pick up cards for stuff like EDH decks or to have them altered, you can get some real steals from the bigger vendors if you look carefully or ask to see their rough stuff. I was able to source staples for EDH like Sol Ring and Demonic Tutor from SCG at really good prices on their beat up copies, which was just fine for my extra decks and a few friends who didn't have deep collections. If you are looking to get cards, don't rule out trading at the event. You can probably work out deals that would be much more favorable to your goals than what any of the vendors could offer.   Good luck, remember that educating yourself on the value you are looking to unload can only increase your chances of getting good value. Don't be afraid to negotiate, especially if you are working out a big deal. Some vendors are also willing to split up the payout, giving some credit with their bonus offer and cash for the balance. Doesn't hurt to ask."

Here in GP Vegas, CFB was leading the buylist value, especially on the MM2015 stuff.

mtgmarketwatch,37vxh0,Rock-swarm,1 point,Sun May 31 18:03:18 2015 UTC,Most vendors will give an extra 25% if you are taking credit.  If they are not offering at least this much then leave and go to a different one.
mtgmarketwatch,37vxh0,Little_Gray,1 point,Sun May 31 17:27:05 2015 UTC,"Almost every vendor offers a bonus(usually 20%) for taking store credit instead of cash.   They don't have infinite cash, they don't want to give you cash if they can give you cards."

Those are in Ad Nauseam in Modern, and not in any great number (usually 4 or less total).  I wouldn't go deep on them by any means, maybe a playset of the popular color combinations.  They have some EDH appeal, and are certainly viable for a Cube / casual play, but they're not a good long term investment."

mtgmarketwatch,37w897,CorpT,1 point,Sat May 30 22:46:41 2015 UTC,"Most of the temples are going to be casual EDH staples. I expect them to drop hard at rotation and see slow upwards growth. If that is what you're interested in, I think they are reasonable but I don't expect great things from them.  Someone else mentioned the two that are seeing some modern play but I think that will mostly drive the foil price."

mtgmarketwatch,37w897,sloth_clunk,1 point,Mon Jun 1 05:15:17 2015 UTC,"I mean it's going to be $1 or less after rotation, so if you want it to play with, sure? It probably won't go up any appreciable amount because it sees 0 competitive play and there are better lands for casual formats."
mtgmarketwatch,37w897,worldchrisis,1 point,Mon Jun 1 15:18:50 2015 UTC,casual modern brews might just be using it as a budget option over fetches/shocks. I don't think there is much to gain from buying them post-rotation.

mtgmarketwatch,37pqbg,ardeay,6,Fri May 29 14:05:55 2015 UTC,"According to mtg goldfish the price of Tarmogoyf is completely stable and prices on CFB and SCG both reflect similar numbers.  Reports that the print run of MM2015 is larger than most of us expected are allowing the prices of MM2015 Tarmogoyfs to go down.    There are going to be something like 50,000 packs of MM2015 opened in just the main event this weekend.  I have to imagine that at some point it will feel like there is a surplus of any of the cards in the set and some people who just want to subsidize the cost of travel and hotel will be selling their cards stupidly cheap if you have cash to pay for them."

Dropped because goyf. 75$ for a pool and playmat then you can go to aethergames and buylist it for 125 and jump back in. I did this chain twice and my friend once. Some people even more. From my perspective here there are a lot opened like handed out as candy. The price of goyf wont change until after this week when the Stores are trying to sell them.
mtgmarketwatch,37pqbg,Silvermagi,1 point,Sat May 30 13:55:39 2015 UTC,"That would make sense if buylist prices hadn't gone up at the GP.

mtgmarketwatch,37llib,ardeay,3,Thu May 28 19:57:31 2015 UTC,The long term price impact is the important difference. Buyouts can quickly unravel if there isn't real demand behind it.
mtgmarketwatch,37llib,potato1,2,Thu May 28 19:59:26 2015 UTC,Very true. If it is deck-hype it probably won't last either.
mtgmarketwatch,37llib,ardeay,1 point,Thu May 28 20:00:12 2015 UTC,"Seriously, would there be any way to get volume data? I guess the problem is sites like TCG don't publish sales number publicly. eBay does, but these days they don't get a lot of the overall market volume."
mtgmarketwatch,37llib,potato1,2,Thu May 28 20:09:34 2015 UTC,"Being the programmer of www.echomtg.com, I'd say there is, but the load on processing and code to track it probably isn't worth it, nor would it be that reliable across multiple sources."

mtgmarketwatch,37m4dq,barwick11,1 point,Wed Jun 3 00:43:07 2015 UTC,TCGplayer is a horrible place to go for card prices after a buyout/spike.  Actual price is likely around $5.
mtgmarketwatch,37lsqc,tk_fourtwentyone,2,Thu May 28 15:39:06 2015 UTC,"I have a feeling that a lot of the chase cards, mythics especially, will not drop as much as people think.  Locally it seems that people are happy grabbing all these cards at the price they are now.  We also have two high profile Modern weekends directly following GP Vegas; SCG Invitational and Open in Columbus and GP Charlotte. In addition we have the modern PPTQ season which for me locally (Charlotte NC) has at least one Modern PPTQ each weekend within an hour and a half.  The demand for modern cards will be very strong in the coming 2 months or so."

mtgmarketwatch,37lsqc,ardeay,1 point,Fri May 29 06:00:18 2015 UTC,"My reasoning for choosing the GP this weekend as the ""line in the sand"" for measuring price differentials is bc of the jump in supply of MM2 cards that comes with the opening of so many packs at the event."
mtgmarketwatch,37lsqc,fyawm,1 point,Thu May 28 16:09:29 2015 UTC,"Please keep in mind that the spike may only be relevant for Mythic rares, if that. Cryptic Command, which was also reprinted in MMA, didn't hit $30 until some 8 months after the release of MMA, or a month before GP Richmond. Vendilion Clique is a counter-example whose prices never really spiked any in sense but experienced gradual gains leading up to Modern spike during the same period."
mtgmarketwatch,37lsqc,chincolovesyou,1 point,Thu May 28 16:47:30 2015 UTC,"I believe the prices will drop at least another 10-20% and that is based off of the amount of product being opened this weekend at the 3 GPs. If you look at how far the prices have dropped just from the release of the product 1 week ago, it is absolutely staggering. Most rares lost between 30-50% value in a week from people cracking their boxes. Most mythics lost 20-30% value as well. Now imagine what will happen when 15,000 people open their packs this weekend at the GPs. I've been watching Ebay all week and the prices just keep going lower and lower as people try to make their auctions stand out and sell. I imagine next week we'll see a glut in the market from so many people selling their cards when they get home from the GP. That will be the absolute best time to buy whatever cards you're looking for from Modern Masters 2."
mtgmarketwatch,37kmlm,RudelyOutOfContext,6,Thu May 28 09:09:54 2015 UTC,"I mentioned this on another thread, but people raised pitchforks and didn't let me speak.   Between now and the next couple weeks.   The second the red slows down on this page https://www.echomtg.com/set/MM2/modern-masters-2015-edition/ is when the window of opportunity starts to close. The top financials losers shown on the right (or bottom page on mobile) is a very helpful indicator as well.   If everyone is waiting to buy into cryptics at $20, the moment it hits $20 demand will normalize it upwards. My prediction is the window will be small. If you wait a couple week you may win on a ~10% upside in decrease in price. If you need playsets for competitive play, not waiting is ok. The cards will maintain their value or increase in value within the year."

mtgmarketwatch,37kmlm,ardeay,1 point,Thu May 28 11:35:10 2015 UTC,"I think EDH stuff will drop a lot.

mtgmarketwatch,37kmlm,SaffronOlive,2,Thu May 28 15:39:03 2015 UTC,"Actually, if stores really get to reorder three cases each (which has been reported by multiple people on Twitter) just this reorder will represent far more supply than the GPs.   The main events at all three GP's will lead to the opening of about 100,000 packs, or just over 1,000 cases. Considering there are around 100 MTG stores in New York State alone, the GP is really a drop in the bucket compared to over all supply."
mtgmarketwatch,37kmlm,xyals,1 point,Thu May 28 18:46:44 2015 UTC,What about buying from vendors during the GP?

mtgmarketwatch,37gygy,kokkomo,9,Wed May 27 15:40:36 2015 UTC,"I have a case (4 boxes) coming in tomorrow. I will probably never open them. I will probably try to get rid of them at the same price I got them at instead. Then a week or so after GP Vegas or whenever prices seem to have bottomed out I will invest in playsets of MM2 singles instead with that money. Even singles I don't need for decks right now, just because they actually have a potential to grow in value over the next 2 years, I know they are in good condition when I buy them, and I might even want them for future decks.  As you said, who the hell wants to buy potentially damaged products that WotC maybe wont replace later on when the printers are not printing MM2 anymore? WotC messed up."

mtgmarketwatch,37dht1,150crawfish,4,Tue May 26 20:52:28 2015 UTC,"Seems logical.  Shocks simply have not spiked yet and people dont see the easy money.  They wont be reprinted for at least 4 years(if Ravnica City of Guilds and RTR block are any indication).  And with Zendikar fetch reprints seeming likely given the fall set, the cards people will need are the shocks, not the fetches.  Abrupt decay, Eidolon of the Great Revel, LOTV, Snapcaster, even uncommons like lingering souls may see price gains.  Consider that I bought 4 snapcasters less than a year ago at $30.  Now its $50.  If a giest deck resurfaces(and it might), then expect that to rise.  It was reprinted in a very small quantity.  Summer also is the standard ""dead season"".  I see people getting burnt out on the meta and looking to modern to shake things up, just like every summer.  I would be hoarding shocks mostly, as everyone needs lands.  Focus on UR, GB mostly."
mtgmarketwatch,37dht1,Unknown_Phate,1 point,Wed May 27 02:23:55 2015 UTC,"The problem is so many people already have Shocks, because they were so cheap due to how many were opened in RTR block."
mtgmarketwatch,37dht1,worldchrisis,1 point,Wed May 27 20:18:32 2015 UTC,"Except that a shitton of them were sold away.  They slowly are climbing.  Stable growth of a format staple.  I don't see a better investment.  What is always pricey?  Manabases.  Typically the most expensive cards are the ones furthest from their last print(not always true, but age is a trendline).  That means that when the zendikar fetches get reprinted, the saturation of fetches will drive up demand for the shocks again as people have fetches and nothing to fetch for."
mtgmarketwatch,37dht1,Unknown_Phate,1 point,Wed May 27 20:55:15 2015 UTC,Its an issue of supply vs demand.  When they were standard legal everybody was running shocks as a four of.  In modern more often then not you are running 2-3 of any given one.  Modern is still smaller then RTR standard which leaves us with an excess of shocks.  They will eventually rise in price but its going to be awhile.

MMB just put out another wave of mana leak, electrolyze, remand, and lightning bolt foils. Get in on playsets, or just for speculation. Foil terminates are still cheap, though not nearly as cheap as 4 months ago. Lingering Souls foils are still pretty cheap, despite being in the clear for foil reprints until MM2017. There are a TON of all-time lows for modern foil staples right now, all it takes is some research and patience for finding good deals.

If you are on the market for those, the sooner the better, because they'll only go up from here. As far as everything else, I think it's a good time to pick up staples. I'm sure they'll do flashback drafts at some point, but they'll probably gradually rise. I plan on picking stuff up relatively soon."
mtgmarketwatch,37ahk0,drspock4ever,0,Tue May 26 18:01:00 2015 UTC,I picked up two playsets of wastelands when they were around $30 but I wasn't sure where they were going. It seems to be on the rise so I think it's still good to go in now. But I think City of traitors is the better pick considering it was as high as 60 tix at one point.

mtgmarketwatch,37ahk0,JordanMiller406,0,Tue May 26 16:56:44 2015 UTC,That's irrelevant. You can still buy and sell cards even if it's unplayable.
mtgmarketwatch,372z3i,cybrcld,7,Sun May 24 11:25:08 2015 UTC,"Two things leaning me towards the sell option.   Widespread issues with card condition straight out of the pack. This is troubling for casual demand, as well as foil value. WOTC has been happy to replace damaged cards by mailing them back to WOTC after working with their CS reps, but that might not be a feasible option a year from now. The likelyhood that MM becomes a bi-annual product seems quite high, despite the failings of MMB. This could stall a lot of the value gains of things like All is Dust, Noble Hierarch, etc. if they see a 2nd reprint down the line."
mtgmarketwatch,372z3i,Rock-swarm,9,Sun May 24 13:44:03 2015 UTC,"The first ""massive price increase"" was due to Modern as a format exploding in popularity. If Modern doesn't see a similar amount of people suddenly trying to get into affinity, through the breach, and Jund/Junk, those prices will actually stagnate. Also keep in mind the print run difference.  I still stand by my inclination to sell. I think that even if the sealed product price starts to increase, there's at least a month to re-purchase without losing value."
mtgmarketwatch,372z3i,Rock-swarm,2,Sun May 24 17:42:29 2015 UTC,"That was my first instinct, although, the current going reviews are making have 2nd opinions.  Generally, yes* there is more value in this printing than previous, but your chances are less because of the rarity and of the value cards.  Basically the rares are med-low value, the bulk is pretty much exactly that - ""bulk,"" and the value in the printing is all in the mythics which is assumed around 2-3 mythics a box.  http://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/the-expected-value-of-modern-masters-2015  That given that people think MSRP $10 a pack is high as it is, I'm wondering what people might pay for it a year down the road.  I think MM1 had accumulated so much value because people didn't know if or when the next one would come around.  Although now, everyone's pretty set for just waiting for the next 2 years.  I still have friends sitting on their MM1 boxes waiting for a time to sell.  Even if the box were to accumulate value, I'm seeing $350 at most?  You can pretty much almost never get full value of whatever it's worth.  I can maybe get $280-$320 in a year compared to competing with store prices at $250 this year when people are already estimating the box at $220.  (the math....O.o)."
mtgmarketwatch,372z3i,JordanMiller406,0,Sun May 24 21:46:39 2015 UTC,"There are definite QA issues with some of these packs, but it's definitely in the minority, only a very small percentage of packs / boxes have any issues (probably less than 1%).   It is way more widespread than that. A well known vendor posted a picture of an about 2' stack of foils with a noticeable line down the side in the same spot. These were taken from dozens of cases."

mtgmarketwatch,36zubt,MortalSword_MTG,3,Sat May 23 22:19:54 2015 UTC,Exactly.   I have seem a lot of photos from all over the US with quality problems so it's likely widespread.

mtgmarketwatch,36vz9b,Tehdougler,6,Fri May 22 15:44:29 2015 UTC,The problem is that you have to convince everyone you sell to that your friend (and you) are trustworthy.   Why not just have a draft with them?  Then sell the singles?  I think people are going to be more inclined to buy a box of MM2015 than to pay about the same for loose booster packs...
mtgmarketwatch,36vz9b,da_ruiner,2,Fri May 22 16:24:45 2015 UTC,Single packs are going to be tough to sell for top dollar given the fear of mapping. You may trust your source but passing that along to someone else may not work so well. da_ruiner is right - consider drafting with them so you can get some fun out of them and then part with the singles.

mtgmarketwatch,36vz9b,corro13,1 point,Sat May 23 01:50:18 2015 UTC,"Honestly fear of mapping won't stop them selling, I sell heaps of loose packs even from widely mapped sets like innistrad onwards and they all sell without a problem. Just throw them up on ebay for a reasonable fixed price and forget about them.  Sometimes they might take a couple of weeks to sell if it's an expensive booster like a $20 onslaught pack, but eventually someone will buy it (it took about a month for me to sell my last 5).   Also those packs you have there are so old that mapping was barely a thing, it only started becoming a major problem around innistrad. I personally wouldn't buy any loose packs from any sets released now as they're all mapped, in fact dragons of tarkir was mapped before the set was even released. That said, it still doesn't stop people buying them, I've sold hundreds of loose packs from the current standard on ebay."
mtgmarketwatch,36wdq7,Valdarith,8,Fri May 22 17:49:14 2015 UTC,"They're played in non-rotating formats, but they're played in the budget decks of the formats, so I'm not sure how many people are looking to pimp those decks out. I believe that this explains why the foil versions of those cards haven't seen proportional gains. That being said, I've been picking up Eidolon foils when the opportunity presents itself. I agree that they'll go up (especially given how little the set was opened), but I'm uncertain how much."
mtgmarketwatch,36wdq7,Gordonuts,5,Fri May 22 19:41:06 2015 UTC,Compare the art on Goblin Guide. I absolutely loathe the Zendikar art. The GP promo looks incredible. That's why I bought 4.
mtgmarketwatch,36wdq7,floppybeef,0,Fri May 22 20:48:29 2015 UTC,"I second that. Love the GP art, despise the ZEN one.   On point, there's gotta be way less GP Promo copies moving around then ZEN copies. So in the event of a reprint, I believe regular GG will get knocked down hard(er) then promo. I also expect the reprint to have original art. Don't ask why. But that'd enhance the already exclusive (or pimp)-ness of GP Promo. Long term, my money goes on the GP Promo.

mtgmarketwatch,36wdq7,Morzas,1 point,Fri May 22 22:58:45 2015 UTC,The foil multiplier is low because people who build Burn are usually looking for a cheap Legacy deck to get into the format with. The average Burn player is not looking to pimp out their deck. There just isn't enough demand.

In addition, the Theros Gods are gonna be difficult to reprint as cycles.  The mono-colored gods are a cycle of 5, along with the 5 allied and 5 enemy pairs.

With a May 22nd release, and an arbitrary June 1st data point, I'd have to guess... 90% of the current price ($170.00 TCG low for a mint copy; current SCG mint price is $199.99), with another 10% off  by June 1st to account for the first ones cashing out their Tarmogoyfs early.   90% of $170.00 = $153.00 90% of $153.00 = $137.70   So yep.

mtgmarketwatch,362cp9,willaeon,11,Fri May 29 19:29:36 2015 UTC,"Considering the EV of the set isn't much higher than MSRP, I'm expecting that the set simply won't be opened at a rate high enough to greatly affect prices of rares and mythics. As usual, we should expect the EV of the set to drop to around MSRP before demand tapers off as a result. With such a low EV-MSRP margin, it won't take long to get there."
mtgmarketwatch,362cp9,ElvishJerricco,1 point,Fri May 15 15:50:54 2015 UTC,"It's actually down about 10% from its peak. Prior to the announcement it would be in MM2, it was pushing $210 on TCG Mid. Now it's under $190. It's the first time since Pod was banned that it's fallen so low."
mtgmarketwatch,362cp9,gamblekat,0,Fri May 15 15:39:54 2015 UTC,Its selling at or near msrp because the value is not there and people dont want to buy boxes.  Its currently way to much of a lottery.  As you said everything will go down which makes the current ev which barely breaks even look even worse.
mtgmarketwatch,362cp9,Little_Gray,5,Sun May 17 03:31:16 2015 UTC,"I thought the low price would fall to 150; now I think that'll be the mid. So, slightly bearish vs. my original thought."

mtgmarketwatch,362cp9,stitches_extra,3,Fri May 15 16:45:39 2015 UTC,"They're going to keep printing this card in every MMA set forever. It sells packs like nearly nothing else.   Now, this was of course always true, but I think MMA2015 is where this Wisdom becomes Conventional; people will internalize this, thinking, ""I don't need to get my copies NOW if I'm not going to use them immediately; if I miss this time, there'll be another train along shortly."""
mtgmarketwatch,362cp9,IgoRStripes,3,Fri May 15 17:02:20 2015 UTC,"I don't believe I chimed in on the last thread... but maybe I did. Anyway, here's my thoughts on Goyf and other mythics.   Due to the lackluster commons and uncommons (except for the few notables: i.e. Remand, Bolt, StS, Electrolyze, etc), most of the EV will be contrived from rares and mythics. As a result, these rares and mythics will likely not budge a whole lot. Overall, I believe the ones that have fallen since the reprint was first spoiled will stay close to where they are at (maybe slight drops), and those that didn't budge may drop a slight bit. However, after a few months or so (unless there are multiple print runs for some reason), we may see these cards start creeping back up to what they were prior to the reprint announcements (maybe not quite as high, but ultimately they will start upticking, and will continue to do so until another batch hits the market).   That being said, I believe the time to get in on some of these would be about a month or so after release... as saturation would be highest and any dips should be accounted for by then.   However, it is possible that now may be the best time to buy as demand may increase with these cards release, but due to lack of value in other cards in the set, the prices may only go up from now. I know this latter part is contradictory... but it's a bit hard to judge based on what we're currently seeing in the market (limited drops) and what we know about the sets value and play-ability (I don't expect an influx of Modern ""Eldrazi Spawn"" decks).   The cards that see the most in drops will be the more ""fringe"" staples. Daybreak will take a hit that we haven't seen yet largely due to it only being used in Bogles in Modern... aside from EDH/Casual play (which is significant in the ""price"" world). Leyline may or may not see a hit... it is a SB card, but usually as a 3 of (sometimes 2, sometimes 4) and it can be used in the SB of any deck due to the ""starts in play"" clause - of course preferring decks that have ""white"" though. 'Goyf can be used in basically any deck running green (not literally EVERY deck, but a vast majority) and usually is in higher number in decks that do utilize it (4 of), so I could see him not budging much from where he is at now. Especially as he is a mythic. Bobs will drop a bit more, due to current lack of play more than anything though."

mtgmarketwatch,362cp9,Unknown_Phate,2,Fri May 15 22:01:38 2015 UTC,"My prediction goes from about 130 mid to about 200 mid.  IE no change.  Which is disheartening.

I want to play junk midrange but I literally only need goyfs.  And I don't have an extra 800 for magic right now.  I was hoping that goyf would be a rare so this could just be done with.  Wizards doesn't give two shits about modern.  They never have.  Instead they just keep the promise that ""modern isn't like legacy, we want to reprint things"".

Just interested what price u would buy at.    goyf Sells boxes- and is wizard's golden goose for the modern format.  you can't really be mad that they want to keep prices up for a few more printings to try to make money on modern. They will come down, but probably not at the rate to please everyone.  so I suppose the choice is to either save and play them (like I did) or pay something eLse. At least there are heaps of very good decks around"

Yes it hurt, but i had decided i wanted to play jund and had everything else. I also got future sight ones.   #GoyfElitist  There are some not terrible points about tarmogoys being the real barrier to modern - at least it is really only required for 3 decks in the format - jund, junk and zoo. I am sure people will be able to name other decks that it is played in to disprove my entire point.  Which gets me too my point- at least tarmogoyf doesnt shut you out of the entire format, only a small part of it.  Lands on the other hand are quite expensive and really difficult for anyone changing colours to deal with. a new player, wanting to play  a 2 colour deck will need 8 fetches, 2 shocks. that's $100-120 before you even start. make it three colours for grixis delver and suddenly the wallet of a new player is really hurting. I am happier that they have come to the party with land reprints.   I posted a similar comment on modern nexus the other day, when they posted tarmo as one of the ""ugly"" picks of mm15. I was a bit surprised that they call it a true barrier to modern, when in fact it is only a few decks that run it, and there are many many good tier 1 and 1.5 options that do not run it. I dont care if my goys are worthless - i just want to play the deck.   I am not trying to justify the reprinting, just think it is probably not as bad as some people think.   I think the price will come down - it has to. here is a spreadsheet showing all the value of the rares and mythics at tcg low, and then figuring how much the market needs to drop to meet them msrp of mm15. so 140 is definitely a possibility, and this assumes that msrp is the floor for people opening boxes - when lots of people open boxes when the ev is below MSRP."

I am going to stay on jund for the foreseeable future, so not reason to hold them. but then it is just inconvenient to buy them back in the future.   I suppose clique will be the mythic of choice to compare it to. If it doesnt drop, probably hold them. you think that sounds right?"
mtgmarketwatch,362cp9,potato1,1 point,Mon May 18 00:17:48 2015 UTC,"Im on the hold because I have a twin deck too(needs cryptics and cliques still) and a friend who doesn't have a modern deck who I lend mine too when he plays(infrequently).  If it were a matter of money, Im rather pragmatic when it comes to staples and try to hold to a play-set no matter how good the money is.  The cost of my time in hours to re-aqquire snapcasters is worth far too much to just having a set.  If I had 5, I would sell the extra's within the next month here.  I got them at about 30 a piece and I would let extra's go at 50 if I wouldn't just rather have them on the assurance I wouldn't need to hunt them down again"

mtgmarketwatch,362cp9,Little_Gray,5,Fri May 15 16:27:51 2015 UTC,I think it will drop to somewhere around the $150 range then then slowly recover to its previous heights.  While there will be a not insignificant number of Goyfs entering the market I think the demand will still be there.  If people are willing to pay $200 for one right now they will jump on it at $150 and cause a price increase.      Remember that you will average 1 gofy per 5 boxes.
mtgmarketwatch,362cp9,jesuschristwalks,2,Fri May 15 15:37:00 2015 UTC,"I thought it would drop to $80, but I'm going to revise my prediction to $120 now that the rest of the set was revealed to be pretty lame.  I think $150 is extremely conservative, as SCG is already pre-selling at $160."
mtgmarketwatch,362cp9,Little_Gray,1 point,Fri May 15 15:26:30 2015 UTC,Initially I would have agreed with you but something has to prop up the EV of a box.  It is going to have to be from the mythics and I dont think that can happen if Gofy loses more then $50.

Even rares with multiformat play like Tasigur and Rhino have had trouble maintaining $9 and Protector isn't going to be played outside Standard. It's already a 3-4'of in every green deck; can't get much more popular.

I like foils and the FNM promo, but don't think normal printings are worth it.  Foil multiplier is less than 2x right now, which is pretty low for something that sees a decent amount of play in Modern.  Might be worth watching."
mtgmarketwatch,35ro0z,Manadyne,1 point,Tue May 12 23:28:39 2015 UTC,That's a fair shout actually.
mtgmarketwatch,35ro0z,Little_Gray,3,Wed May 13 00:22:07 2015 UTC,It stopped seeing loads of play when pod got banned.  Now it sees minor play in some fringe decks.
mtgmarketwatch,35ro0z,worldchrisis,2,Wed May 13 01:03:56 2015 UTC,Sees very little play without Pod in the format. Was reprinted at U in MM1. Not a good spec IMO.
mtgmarketwatch,35pw5c,Radouf,6,Tue May 12 15:16:40 2015 UTC,"We have a few things to consider here:   This is an FNM promo, which means it's not a huge quantity being printed. While it does add additional product, it's not going to hugely inflate the market.   It's new art. The overwhelming opinion of said art is negative. While people will use it over not having it at all, I don't expect it to hold the value of the old art foils.  It's foil only. Many people prefer not to play with foils, so many people could very well prefer to jump on pack copies now expecting the price to drop, causing it to see an insignificant drop if any.     Overall, I expect we'll see a dip of a dollar or two during August/September, but long-term this isn't going to affect the price in a huge way. Look at Path to Exile. The card is a staple in white decks in Modern, has 6 printings, and is still a $5 card. Serum Visions sees more play than Path, and this is only its third printing. Use the lull to pick up the version you prefer, but going forward this is going to be back up to it's current price within a year."
mtgmarketwatch,35pw5c,Snow_Regalia,2,Tue May 12 17:52:01 2015 UTC,Who doesn't prefer to play with foils?
mtgmarketwatch,35pw5c,da_ruiner,4,Wed May 13 12:57:16 2015 UTC,"Depending on the set, a lot of foils are very warpy and difficult to straighten out. It's not always worth the hassle. Also doesn't help that in many cases, with staples, they're far more expensive than they should be, so unless you're balls deep into the format you're foiling out, it's not really worth the effort and cash.  Edit: I mean, you can downvote me, but these are exactly the reasons I'm familiar with people preferring to not play with foils."
mtgmarketwatch,35pw5c,Sand_Coffin,1 point,Wed May 13 17:36:08 2015 UTC,With something on the line a player might call a judge on you if none of your other cards are foil but it's strange one playset is foil.
mtgmarketwatch,35pw5c,Red_Beam,1 point,Wed May 13 20:47:29 2015 UTC,"I don't like to play with them in sanctioned events if I can avoid it. I have a few foils that I play with because I don't own enough nonfoil copies of a particular card and I have a few foils in my EDH decks because they look cool in small doses. I think foiling out a whole deck actually makes them look less cool because they all look normal.  Searching through a deck of foils gives me a headache and makes me dizzy. They also bend too much and you can't really play foil copies of certain cards and nonfoils of certain other cards, because you can have issues with them being discernible and therefore marked.  If I'm trying to pimp out a deck I get foreign nonfoils, preferably with artist signatures."
mtgmarketwatch,35pw5c,worldchrisis,1 point,Thu May 14 15:06:11 2015 UTC,"Might be late to the thread, but as a rather competitive player I hate playing with foils so I can't be called out for card marking. If only one card(or one playset) is foiled then there is some case for a judge call for marking cards. I'd just rather avoid that situation all together."

If there is is more then 16 people looking for playsets then demand will outstrip supply and nothing will change.

mtgmarketwatch,35pw5c,RideTheIguana,-19,Tue May 12 15:30:08 2015 UTC,"No that is exactly how supply and demand works.  If supply outstrips demand prices decrease, if demand outstrips supply prices increase which is what is currently happening."
mtgmarketwatch,35pw5c,Little_Gray,10,Tue May 12 16:20:41 2015 UTC,"No, the intersection of supply and demand is where the price will reach equilibrium.

""demand will outstrip supply and nothing will change"" This sentence is incorrect, this is an increase in supply but not demand so by this logic prices will fall. Then, in your next comment you went on to contradict yourself, and say ""if demand outstrips supply prices increase.""   You did not factor current prices into your discussion, which is an important omission, Only if more than 15 playsets per store is the quantity demanded at the current price will prices increase.  I'm sorry if I came off as pretentious, and shouldn't have waved my economics degree around.

mtgmarketwatch,35pw5c,RideTheIguana,-20,Tue May 12 17:02:50 2015 UTC,You really are laughable.  Trying to wave your little dick around and instead just making yourself look like an idiot.    I did not contradict myself at all when I said nothing will change if demand outstrips supply because if you bothered paying attention that is exactly what is going on right now.    I simply asked a simplified question because reddit in not the place for in depth intelligent discussion.  Sorry I decided ask to the question in a simplified way instead of writing an entire fucking article like you seem to want.    You are not trying to encourage an educated climate.

mtgmarketwatch,35pw5c,Little_Gray,7,Tue May 12 17:12:40 2015 UTC,"Have you read any basic economy book or course? RideTheIguana is right. For example: There is currently 100 Serum Visions floating around your LGS, but there are enough players that 300 Serum Visions could be useful. Some players want an extra play set so they can have two modern decks sleeved, some want a pair for EDH and some because they want to get into Modern. In the current situation the price is $10 and only those who want one play set for their Modern deck own Serum Visions. If 250 extra copies were introduced to the market the price would drop to near bulk since there are now more Serum Visions than players can find decks for. If 0 new copies are introduced the price stay the same. If however 50 new copies are introduced to the market, doesn't it sound logical to you that the price would be between $10 and $0?"

mtgmarketwatch,35jebc,mtd14,6,Sun May 10 23:14:44 2015 UTC,"tl;dr No.  It will drop like a rock in a month or two, just like every set. It's already valued at $108 online vs. $280 in paper. And you can be sure that as soon as redemption hits MODO bot holders will start leveraging that margin, hard.  If anything, Dragons peaked in an unspectacular fashion. Theros and KTK were both over $300 at their peaks, DTK just looked weak/bad, and people keep chasing whatever card is going to end up holding any value.  MM15 won't compete with it meaningfully as your average drafter doesn't want to pay $45 to draft. Especially when they are as likely to open a Ant Queen as a Cryptic Command. Moreover, stores will happily just sell the boxes rather than saving for drafting, and if not, they will run out quickly enough anyway."

The interesting thing is that DTK keeps getting sold out online and the price is rising.  It started around $108, went down to $102 for a day as people expected tons to be available and now it's back up to $113.  The bots either aren't able to buy as many as expected or people are snapping them up at whatever price they need to."

That is where I am talking about the $100 drop in price to come from. And given you can already buy a full set on Ebay for $170 I'd say I was right, I just had not realized redempoin had already hit. It is just a matter of time until individual card prices fall into line as paper always corrects more slowly than online. Which will hurt the ~$97 EV OP was asking about."
mtgmarketwatch,35jebc,Rock-swarm,1 point,Mon May 11 17:40:26 2015 UTC,"Steady decline in price until next year, when KTK and FRF rotate out, leaving DTK and Origins as the pair of underdrafted sets with meaningful standard staples.  The long-term problem with DTK is the fact that relatively few cards will maintain demand outside of standard. Dromoka's Command, Atarka's Command, Col Com, and the casual appeal of the dragonlords are all the set really contributes outside of standard. DKA was a good counter-example, as that set was filled with casual and multi-format staples."
mtgmarketwatch,35jebc,Kengy,1 point,Mon May 11 07:21:53 2015 UTC,DTK rotates out with KTK and FRF. The 2 set rotation starts with the upcoming Zendikar.    Edit: I am wrong!
mtgmarketwatch,35jebc,Rock-swarm,1 point,Wed May 13 19:29:29 2015 UTC,"Incorrect. DTK stays in with Origins, while KTK and FRF rotate out.

I just can't see this card maintaining that high of a price because the variance is so wide. It is seeing play in modern elves, but even Siege Rhino was only $6-$8 most of it's initial modern domination.  It's crazy how high the value is for DTK right now. So many rares and mythics pay for a pack, and just on MODO a complete set is still over $100... I wonder how long it will last."

It was clearly very wrong, but luckily it ended up good elsewhere.  If someone bought into every card someone speculated would be good when they were looking at it in a vacuum, they would be buying new cards every day and be down thousands of dollars.

mtgmarketwatch,35awee,skybluebanana,5,Fri May 8 18:09:12 2015 UTC,"I agree the EV is a bit of a problem, but the bigger problem is the variance! I can do a draft then walk away with $2 worth of rares after spending $40, and unless I get a Remand the uncommons/commons aren't doing much for me either. The first MM1 had a lower variance rare/mythics, and it has plenty of $2-$5 uncommons/commons to redeem the value. Spell Snare, Path, Electolyze, Helix, E Wit, Mind Funeral, and Finks at uncommon vs Remand, Plating, Bolt, and Dismember."
mtgmarketwatch,35awee,Rock-swarm,1 point,Sat May 9 05:37:29 2015 UTC,"yea, opening a draft pack, if you don't get one of the money mythics or rares, you will feel very sad indeed, considering there is no common/uncommon safety net of value and a set full of shit bulk"
mtgmarketwatch,35awee,Rock-swarm,-3,Sat May 9 06:53:38 2015 UTC,I'm guessing you haven't seen the EV on the MM2 set yet. I'll give you a hint - it's higher than the MSRP.
mtgmarketwatch,35awee,Angelbaka,2,Fri May 8 19:17:56 2015 UTC,"The price corrections are the intended result of the set. +EV before release and NeutralEV or slightly -EV after release means the set size was just large enough to satisfy short-term modern demand.  EDIT - I just checked the values on your spreadsheet, and some of them are WAY low, considering the condition of all MM2 reprints will be in NM condition. Fulminator mage and Wil-Leaf are the two biggest discrepancies due to condition.   Even with those discrepancies, MM2 being projected to have just under $9 in average pack value after market corrections means they hit very close to their intended mark."
mtgmarketwatch,35awee,Rock-swarm,1 point,Fri May 8 19:43:53 2015 UTC,"For how long, though? I expect it'll level out real hard after the summer gp's."

mtgmarketwatch,35awee,Little_Gray,6,Fri May 8 19:48:18 2015 UTC,"I also feel like the expensive rares/mythics in this set won't be dropping much. I expected things like Cryptic & Clique to drop a lot with the set, but with the high % of actual junk rares and few value commons/uncommons combined with $10 MSRP... Something has to give value to the packs and it'll probably be those."
mtgmarketwatch,35awee,Chosler88,2,Fri May 8 20:37:43 2015 UTC,Just picked up my Serum Visions (to own and play). Can they go higher?
mtgmarketwatch,35awee,Little_Gray,2,Fri May 8 16:10:25 2015 UTC,They have already gone up 25% since the full spoiler and probably will not stop for awhile.  They should hopefully take a small hit if they are indeed the FNM promo but without a real reprint they seem like they will be slow gainers for a long time.    We are seeing the MM effect in place in which demand has been held off because everybody was expecting a reprint but now that its not people are going crazy for it.
mtgmarketwatch,35awee,C_Terror,10,Fri May 8 16:55:10 2015 UTC,"No, we're seeing the speculator effect."
mtgmarketwatch,35awee,Little_Gray,5,Fri May 8 17:14:15 2015 UTC,Sort of.  We are seeing the tons of people who dumped their serum visions in expectation of a reprint scrambling to get them back effect.   On top of that you also have all the people who were previously holding off on buying theirs in expectation of a reprint as well as people seeing the price increase and trying to get in now and make some money.
mtgmarketwatch,35awee,RideTheIguana,2,Fri May 8 17:19:49 2015 UTC,I am one of the many who dumped my playset of visions and probes in expectations of a reprint.   Guess I won't be playing Twin/Delver for a while. -_-

mtgmarketwatch,35awee,anubis647,1 point,Fri May 8 19:50:25 2015 UTC,"Correct. But that demand is coming from speculators buying them, not players finishing decks or whatever."

Of course there are speculators now, but this isn't a simple buyout, and the speculators know there are players who aren't as saavy paying attention in the market whom they can be marketmakers for. Will the price sustain what it ends up at in the next few days? Only time will tell."

There isn't any mechanic or story-tied significance to it.  We know we'll be visiting 10 different planes in Origins.  Mirrodin, home of the ""aether"" may be one of those planes.    Serum Visions, Gitaxian Probe, and Inquisition of Kozilek are far less likely because Visions involves the scry mechanic and Probe and Inquisition refer to  time and plane-specific  characters (as well as Probe using a set-specific mechanic)."
mtgmarketwatch,35awee,Morzas,3,Fri May 8 17:54:18 2015 UTC,"I highly doubt aether vial would be reprinted in a standard environment, I play with it in my main modern deck and it's absolutely insane.

I thought the price increase was to justify this being packed with solid cards and I also thought this was going to be a great chance for them to do a modern cube (before anyone says, yes I know boxes will be different and it will never be exactly like a cube). But what I mean is, I would have liked to see this set jammed full of powerful cards, not sacrificed valuable reprint slots for ""flavour"". Do we really always need these poor tribal themes in such a high value product? why not elves, merfolk, goblin, soldier and vampire?"

mtgmarketwatch,35b12h,Radouf,0,Tue May 12 15:17:22 2015 UTC,"I'm not here to bitch about the fact that I didn't hold onto my playset, and my goal isn't to accuse the community here or at r/mtgfinance of being wrong. BUT I feel the need to call out the overwhelming majority of posters who in the lead-up to MM2 were convinced that Serum Visions was being reprinted and whose repeated advice to posters here was to offload their copies.   Reprints are a bit of a crapshoot, but ultimately I'd simply like people to admit they were wrong about this card."
mtgmarketwatch,35b12h,jbmoskow,8,Fri May 8 17:37:41 2015 UTC,"Just buy your set now.  You lost $10, really not that terrible in the grand scheme of things. We can whinge about wizards or can just get on with the game of playing magic.  Sometimes 95% chances miss.  What's important isn't whether you were wrong or right, but the process you followed in making your decision, and whether given the same information again, you would make the same decision again.    It's pretty obvious that a lot of people were wrong.  But it was a low downside risk.  If u couldn't afford to buy back in for slightly more than you sold traded for, well that's actually a factor you should take into account next time when considering selling around reprints.    I have made a lot of assumptions here about you - that you haven't (or can't) buy back in, that u made your decisions based on the advice of others. These are likely wrong.    I just wanted to write to say it's the process that's important.  there was never ever going to be a 100% inclusion before the spoilers were out. there was always the risk that it wasn't going to be reprinted - that's implied in anyone's prediction."
mtgmarketwatch,35b12h,Volition85,7,Sat May 9 01:44:08 2015 UTC,I will be the first admit that I was wrong then.    It is the most expensive modern legal common and seemed like tarmogyf obvious levels of inclusion.    I will also throw it out there that I now fully expect the unknown August FNM promo to be Serum Visions.
mtgmarketwatch,35b12h,Little_Gray,2,Fri May 8 18:03:19 2015 UTC,It just seems like an incredible oversight to me truly. I sincerely hope you're correct about it being the August promo.
mtgmarketwatch,35b12h,jbmoskow,4,Fri May 8 18:13:15 2015 UTC,That's more of a screw up on Wizards' part than the players.
mtgmarketwatch,35b12h,blindfremen,3,Fri May 8 19:07:05 2015 UTC,"The process is what matters, not the results. Given Serum Visions' inflated price, it's a prime target for a reprint sooner or later.

It should have been included, and the potential loss from a reprint at common outweighed the chance that it wouldn't be reprinted. I'm not beating myself up for getting rid of my playset. My attitude of dumping Modern staples for Legacy stuff has already paid off given the falling prices of Remand, Hierarch,  Cryptic, Recall,  etc. Also, it's not like the cards that weren't included will never be reprinted.

mtgmarketwatch,35b12h,xyals,1 point,Sat May 9 00:19:22 2015 UTC,My friend was trying to trade for some Serum Visions last week. I felt good about stepping in and stopping the trade because I feel like he was getting ripped off trading staples for a few commons that were going to be worth only a fraction of its price in a few days. Boy do I feel like a dick now. I apologized as soon as I saw the spoilers.
mtgmarketwatch,35b12h,crminshaw,1 point,Sat May 9 06:57:08 2015 UTC,"Same is true with gitaxian probe. Personally, I kept hold of my playsets simply because they are versatile cards that are used in many decks, and selling them is not worth the hassle of getting hold of new MMA2015 copies. I know many people who did the same. Realistically, printing serum visions at uncommon would not really alter the price too much (maybe dropping a few dollars), and is that few dollars really worth it to lose (original) copies of a staple card? Looking at uncommon staple cards such as path to exile in MMA, they weren't really affected by a new printing anyway. In my opinion, if people really were smart in MTG finance, they'd be keeping hold of their copies rather than selling.  Just my two cents."
mtgmarketwatch,35b12h,aec131,-2,Fri May 8 16:45:45 2015 UTC,That's why I offloaded my visions at $8 months ago and at 11:01 this morning bought 11 at $5 each

mtgmarketwatch,358hbg,alblaster,3,Fri May 8 20:40:46 2015 UTC,I think it was a better deal before.  It seems that a box and foil goyf are about the same.  So if you really want that foil goyf it could be worth it.  Since the foil goyf might go down a little I wouldn't pay more than it's worth now.
mtgmarketwatch,358hbg,idontknowhowreddit,3,Fri May 8 22:02:10 2015 UTC,"Seems like right now it's a good trade, but as mentioned, goyf might drop with a new printing. Generally speaking MM booster boxes will probably not drop unless counterfeiting gets worse, but even still a sealed box might still be fine (depends on if people still want legitimate cards that can be counterfeit or if counterfeiters can start making hard to spot illegal boxes).  tl;dr : maybe, maybe not."
mtgmarketwatch,358hbg,chincolovesyou,1 point,Fri May 8 06:04:15 2015 UTC,I would sell the box of MM1 or take a trade for eternal cards that aren't getting a reprint. At least then you know you're locking in the value for your box. I can't see MM1 boxes climbing too much higher since MM2 seems to be better in general and that may affect the price of MM1 boxes. Tough call overall.
mtgmarketwatch,358hbg,drewb1997,0,Fri May 8 15:11:51 2015 UTC,"Probably one of the easiest things to do is look at the price that other places are selling their boxes for and using that as a baseline. Otherwise see what people are selling individual packs for and multiply that by 24.  In regards to selling an entire box for a foil tarmogoyf, it may be a bit up in the air. Tarmogoyf has already been confirmed to be printed in modern masters 2015 and as such his price will probably soon be lowered. It may not be an entirely safe gamble to get rid of something that will only ever really increase in value (your box of MM) for something that is easily foreseeable to decrease in price (a foil goyf.)"
mtgmarketwatch,358hbg,NevPicasso,5,Fri May 8 01:08:48 2015 UTC,"Nothing is guaranteed to rise, there are variable factors.  If Modern Masters becomes an every year or every other year product with many of the same cards as the original, I don't see it going up much.  Modern Masters 2015 is already a better value set than the original and time will tell if it's as good for limited."

And no offense, but when some unproven 19 year old kid starts charging people to read his ""mtg finance insights"" it's kind of a joke.   I have no problem with the Starcity premium, because the articles there are written by pros with valuable insights. Even Channel Fireball has quality articles like ""what's the play"", ""to fetch or not to fetch"" and ""when should you kill the courser?"" (couple recent examples) where it's written by proven pros.   But some random Joe writing about basic economics on magic cards? No thanks."

I especially don't find value from subscribing to these mtg finance sites. I read the occasional article because it's a fun read and it's nice to see discussion on all aspects on a game I love, including finance.   Something writers can claim legitimacy is posting the worth of their entire ""magic portfolio"" and their stake in trading, and how much they earned while trading at a quarterly/bi annual basis. People tend to pay more attention to those who command a higher net worth, higher % of return and higher $ earnings. Who knows, maybe one day mtg finance will get so advanced that mtg mutual funds might get started. When that day does happen, then I'll maybe consider the large portfolio managers ""pros with valuable insight"".

Some writers about bulk only like Franco Audieri or Saffron Olive(lol :p) Store buyers like Paul Feudo or the one from MTGtokyo. Can't remember his name off the top of my head.

Paul Feudo thinks these guys are a joke. They're all so afraid of counterfeits but they don't own anything valueable. Sig owns a few duals. Big deal and idk what Jason's highest investment is.   These aren't the people I want to listen to or read from because they're barely invested. They may have a ton of small garbage cards. Who cares? That's nothing compared to me someone like Dan, Brian, Franco,etc. I myself barely have what I consider a high investment and I own every dual, beta/unlimited power and practically 2 of every judge promo.

mtgmarketwatch,35204a,GosuMagic,0,Fri May 8 17:41:23 2015 UTC,I appreciate it. I'll also hold out hope for a large inheritance so I can buy beta power and have my opinion mean something :)
mtgmarketwatch,35204a,Chosler88,-1,Fri May 8 18:39:41 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't put too much weight into what these people are saying.  So many people in the magic community want the reserve list abolished, all cards to be affordable, tier 1 decks in modern to be 10 dollars so they can play whatever they want from week to week, and an endless supply of high quality ad free content they don't have to buy.  I think the low cost subscription model is a great way for you to keep the lights on at your website with a little bit of money left over to go to Fogo once in a while.  Keep up the good work."
mtgmarketwatch,35204a,bfro,3,Wed May 6 20:10:22 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the kind words. I wish more people here agreed that people deserve to be compensated for their work the way they choose to be, by virtue of it being their own work to do with as they choose. Fortunately, the opinions expressed in this sub are not representative of the entire community.  At the end of the day, it's one thing to believe a particular site/subscription isn't for you, and another to be so aggressive about the mere existence of such sites. The brigade of downvotes I've received in this thread for neutral statements like ""We want to do right by our subscribers, not scam them out of $5 a month"" represents the latter."
mtgmarketwatch,35204a,Chosler88,8,Thu May 7 08:12:46 2015 UTC,"Owner of a paywall site here [QS].  I want to explain why paywalls exist by explaining the business models that are available to content sites (specifically niche sites).  All sites need to make money to pay the staff.  We employ about a dozen people for our content team and a full-time software developer, and then some.  Basically, all the money we make goes towards paying people to keep the site running.  We spend very little on ads, and the owners don't really take any profits (we work for our money like everyone else on the team).  I'm one of the founders, and I'll tell you; we are doing very well, but no one is getting filthy rich over here.   Before I continue, I want to address the idea of ""everyone has the same info"".  That's inaccurate.  I am not going to shill for my own site here, but I can only speak from first-hand experience (though I am sure other site owners will agree);  we have information that  others don't.  Our price database goes back 2 1/2 years, with hourly price data.  Others don't have that because it took hundreds of man-hours to get it running on enterprise-class data servers.  I know because I was the one who built it, and it was miserable!    Second, our articles are written by Pro Tour players, Grand Prix winners, retail store owner/managers and others who have operated at the highest levels of the game.  They have information others don't, as a result of their depth of experience.  The downside is that they understand the value of their time, and we gotta pay them the big bucks :)  Every so often we'll hire ""some 19 year old kid"", but we consider that scouting, not just hiring whoever's available.    The idea of a paywall product is to give leverage to the two above aspects and make it broadly accessible to the average Magic player.  You'd rather be at FNM than reading about the finer points of maintaining 'big data' warehouses.  (well, so would I, but that's why they call it ""work"").  The reader pays their subscription fee so they can tap into the work we're doing without doing the groundwork themselves.  And, the bottom line is, if the value isn't there, no one will subscribe!  It's really easy to make a shitty paywall site; when no one pays for it, then you have no pressure to actively improve it.    ANYWAY, in order to produce a product people want, you need to pay people to do work.  To generate that cash, here are your choices:  1) Advertising.  To do this, you need INSANE traffic.  Also, MTG players love AdBlock.  One of our mentor/advisors runs a network of multi-million-dollar sites that generate ad revenue, and he was very clear that ad revenue is just awful.  No MTG site can sustain on purely ads alone.  You need traffic in the tens of millions of page views to even start considering real money, let alone sustaining a staff of our size.  Secondarily, the incentive with ad revenue is to drive page views;  that's why you see clickbait headlines.  If I ever publish an article containing the phrase, ""What happens next will blow your mind"", I will record a video of myself eating a Magic Card sandwich on bread as punishment.  Ad sites want to publish quantity, and nothing else matters.  We don't want to play that game!  2) Sponsorship.  I'll be blunt: sponsorship is bribery.  Technically, a sponsor doesn't control the message, but I have found that to be overly idealistic in this industry.  A sponsored man is a bought man, and his opinions are those of the highest bidder.  As a financial site, we CANNOT be those guys.  We have nothing to sell you beyond an educated point of view.   If we were in the pocket of a MTG reseller, you'd never be able to trust a word we say.  3) Ancillary Products.  This is how CFB makes money.  They give away content to build trust in their brand and to draw attention to their site.  Their site sells Magic cards.  If we did this, no one would take our advice seriously (nor would we have any incentive to tell you NOT to buy a card).  I once wrote for a major MTG retail site and had an article rejected outright because it was about cards to avoid.  That was the day I decided not to write for any other MTG sites besides QS.  This tactic works for CFB (who could TOTALLY charge for their articles, IMO, but that's not my place to say) but it's not for us because, well, we don't want to sell you anything but good, refined information.  4) Paywall!   We believe this is the most transparent bargain with the customer;  you know why you are paying money, you know what it's going towards, and the quality of the product is directly correlated with its financial success. The quality of articles on CFB has no correlation to the cards they sell; their NM Jaces are just as NM as the next guy's.  We're lucky that they take their articles very seriously; they are staffed by some of the best to ever play the game and the fact that it's all free is amazing.  It's good to sell millions of dollars of Magic cards every year :)  So, in short, we do a paywall because it's the most honest, transparent way to make money online.  Anything else is giving away a product for free in the hopes of persuading the user to buy another product.  We figure, hey, why not just focus on the product itself and make it worth paying for?  Anyway, I hope this helps the discussion along a bit.  I think that paywalls are an objectively great way to make money online, but I think they require the most work and the highest commitment to quality.  Not for the faint of heart, and DEFINITELY not something towards which  every MTG webmaster should aspire.   Yes, there have been about a dozen me-too finance sites in the last few years.  That was an inevitability, especially since mtg price data is basically a commodity these days.  I think it's good for the ecosystem to have multiple paywall and opinion sites, and ultimately some will make it and others will not.  It's tempting to throw up a paywall on a popular site, as many have done, but it's much harder to maintain that for 5+ years.  I'm 31 years old and I have no idea how I'm not 100% gray-haired by now :)"
mtgmarketwatch,35204a,kellyreid,2,Thu May 7 19:52:55 2015 UTC,"I think that people who write for sites deserve compensation. However, I think that for the website owners/managers, paywalling articles is not always the best way to generate revenue. They are competing against free content, and the very nature of a paywall makes it difficult to judge whether or the content is worth while.  The New York Times paywalls, but they're such a known quantity. You know what you are getting with the NYT. With MTGprice? Well you might know Jason, Corbin. etc al. or you may not. Then again, even the NYT gives X free articles a month. MTGprice doesn't paywall all articles either, but it is a business model that doesn't attract me. I don't subscribe to SCG because there is excellent content available on a site like CFB. In fact, it has lead me a little to being more likely to do business with CFB than SCG. I like SCG, they have great events etc. but I'd rather their content wasn't paywalled and I could patronize them by buying singles etc. CFB gets more money out of me by having free articles and attracting me to their site frequently than SCG does. MTGprice runs the same risk, if another good finance site has free content, but other monetization strategies, I may be more likely to patronize their business."
mtgmarketwatch,35204a,jassi007,5,Wed May 6 14:24:17 2015 UTC,"It's self-regulating. QS and MTGPrice feel like their visibility has reached a point at which their content should be paid for. I think it's a suicidal business decision; SCG gets away with premium content because they have actual market share and 'market mover' potential for card prices, so even if their actionable premium content gets leaked to the masses, they stand to benefit from the singles sales. QS and MTGPrice might be suffering from the fact that a significant portion of their reader base uses apps like Adblock+ to make traditional ad revenue not an option.  I don't blame them for trying to make money, but the paywalls are going to be a detriment to their business model."
mtgmarketwatch,35204a,Rock-swarm,2,Wed May 6 13:33:15 2015 UTC,"I doubt very such that it's suicide for QS, since I was one of the original writers behind the QS paywall a few years ago, and their model is still going just fine. Most of the writers at QS pour hours of market research into their articles each week, and I know that the goal for all of us (at least when I was still writing) was to make money for the people willing to read our content. I can say for sure that the material on QS isn't there just to be a cash grab for the site, and that the writers there want to make sure the reader base feels like they're getting their moneys worth on the subscription."
mtgmarketwatch,35204a,omegaorb,2,Wed May 6 16:44:07 2015 UTC,"We're still doing very well, thanks :)  Ads are not an option in this niche, the market is 100x too small and adblock is a major blocker.  We'd not exist if we didn't paywall.  Sure there are more free offerings these days, but that just means that we have to spend more time and money making sure our stuff is better than what's being given away for free.  And if we cannot do that, then our business model isn't justified.  But, judging by our current stats, I'm not too worried about that."
mtgmarketwatch,35204a,kellyreid,-1,Thu May 7 19:56:17 2015 UTC,"I'm sure every point you've said is true, but it doesn't change the fact that the paywall is a bad business model. Hell, the paywall made more sense back before sites like MTGStocks or MTGTop8 existed, but the spread of information is just too diffused nowadays for the paywall model to be successful."
mtgmarketwatch,35204a,Rock-swarm,2,Wed May 6 17:05:49 2015 UTC,"QS has been charging for four years now and is alive and well, doesn't that equal success on some level? The NYT doesn't have information that isn't available anywhere else, but they're moving increasingly toward paywalls.   Do you have any statistics or special knowledge that helped you form this opinion? You seem to understand so much about the business models of these sites I would appreciate your insight.   Speaking specifically for mtgprice, we understand that not everyone wants to be behind the paywall, and that's why we keep articles on the free side as well. We want to add value for subscribers, not take it away from anyone else."
mtgmarketwatch,35204a,Chosler88,2,Wed May 6 19:02:20 2015 UTC,"Obviously I don't have data on QS's financial data - the benefits of being a privately owned company. With that said, it doesn't take an exceptionally observant person to see that sites like reddit and the aforementioned MTGStocks/MTGTop8 give even hardcore speculators a ton of information to formulate their strategy.  Your NYT example is a poor one - NYT actually does have certain info that is literally disseminated from them, and them alone. That's the point of breaking a news story. We can argue semantics over whether or not a MTG singles buyout counts as ""breaking news"", but I can certainly tell you that buyout announcements aren't exactly a glowing solicitation for website subscriptions..."
mtgmarketwatch,35204a,Rock-swarm,1 point,Wed May 6 20:36:30 2015 UTC,"I understand, thanks for your feedback. You are making definitive, blanket statements about business models and passing judgment on those models without seemingly having any insight to back up those statements, and I just wasn't sure how you came to make such decisive statements with accuracy. I didn't know if I was missing something so I wanted to ask."
mtgmarketwatch,35204a,Chosler88,4,Wed May 6 23:22:21 2015 UTC,"The SCG paywall is just SCG. It's a marketing gimmick. By charging you for their information, they make the information inherently more valuable. Pearls and diamonds distributors do similar business tactics to justify the outrageous prices their cartels generate.   QS uses the same tactic, but with a legitimate business upside and cost behind it: the TraderTools product. QS probably has enough of a reputation at this point to make the paywall worthwhile without it, but because they have a very valuable product outside of their information service that requires constant maintenance and work, I view their paywall in a totally different light.   It's also very hard to quantify the definition of a professional outside of actual LGS ownership/employment, especially when that particular piece of the profession gives you a very different set of opportunities than most mtg finance people can use. Corbin and I have very different priorities, opportunities and outlets as contractors for B&M stores than most people who do Magic finance, but we also had to be good enough at this game (the finance side, not the actual card game) to get the positions we're in and convince the people we work with that our businesses is with their extra time.   Tl;Dr: paywalls are complicated."

To me it feels more and more that the value in a QS Subscription is just that: TraderTools and the articles. The forums haven't provided much useful information lately and every now and then there's an annoying amount of drama, usually related to people who can't avoid being condescending as hell. Also, there's definitely an elitist attitude (I'm smarter than reddit because I pay for a subscription here!) held by a lot (but far from all) posters."
mtgmarketwatch,35204a,asmodeanreborn,3,Wed May 6 22:30:52 2015 UTC,"Kelly, co-founder of QS here.  Thanks for the compliment :)  We have worked really hard for 5 years to justify our existence.    We see articles as part of an indivisible whole;  the articles, tools, trade routes, and forums are distinct aspects of a product which we try to keep as valuable as possible."
mtgmarketwatch,35204a,kellyreid,2,Thu May 7 19:25:11 2015 UTC,"I'm going to try and weigh in and do so as diplomatic as I can be.  I'm going to highlight some things along the way from some of the comments here, and touch on them all with some detail.   It's a little pretentious in my opinion. The mtg ""finance"" articles and insights are not anything ground breaking. And no offense, but when some unproven 19 year old kid starts charging people to read his ""mtg finance insights"" it's kind of a joke. I have no problem with the Starcity premium, because the articles there are written by pros with valuable insights. Even Channel Fireball has quality articles like ""what's the play"", ""to fetch or not to fetch"" and ""when should you kill the courser?"" (couple recent examples) where it's written by proven pros. But some random Joe writing about basic economics on magic cards? No thanks.   This is a totally valid opinion to have, and if you don't want to pay or read finance articles then by all means don't. I don't know any ""unproven 19 year old"" who writes about MTGFinance, unless I'm missing something here. If that was meant to be a rhetorical statement, then again you don't have to read the content. On the other hand, I really think you're making a blanket statement about ""random Joe's"" writing about finance. In this case meaning current finance writers, is really disparaging some hard work and dedication to contribute to the community. Are the finance writer's pro players? To my knowledge no, but that doesn't mean there isn't some really good content out there to read and learn from.   Should the criteria of MTG Finance writing change? Maybe, if the content is that bad, then yeah I'd say that the writer should really consider trying to improve by whatever means necessary. All a writer can be judged on is their integrity as a person, and a respectable track record. Doesn't always have to be about ""calling specs"" but helping in other ways as well. Obviously this would be much more important if said writer had content behind a pay-wall.   QS uses the same tactic, but with a legitimate business upside and cost behind it: the TraderTools product. QS probably has enough of a reputation at this point to make the paywall worthwhile without it, but because they have a very valuable product outside of their information service that requires constant maintenance and work, I view their paywall in a totally different light. To me it feels more and more that the value in a QS Subscription is just that: TraderTools and the articles. The forums haven't provided much useful information lately and every now and then there's an annoying amount of drama, usually related to people who can't avoid being condescending as hell. Also, there's definitely an elitist attitude (I'm smarter than reddit because I pay for a subscription here!) held by a lot (but far from all) posters.   All these paywall sites obviously do it for a reason. There's a lot of upkeep and I'm not claiming to know every little detail about both sites, but the tools offered + the articles are not there just for cash grabs. The software is there to help make money, and the use of these tools is an investment to continue doing so for yourself, and so the websites can continue on and provide the service. If you feel the subscriptions to either site isn't worth it, speak up. Let your opinion be heard, and/or cancel the subscription if it isn't worth the investment.   To the second point; I can understand the drama. It's a little disheartening that there is drama in this community, it's childish and unprofessional. We're all here for a common goal, and there should be respect and ego's should be buried. If intemperate words are said, then we can all be grown adults and apologize and move on. I for one can say I do my very best (to my knowledge) in not trying to come off as abrasive or think myself better than anyone else. I always feel I can learn from others, and while I write content, I would be lying to you all to say I haven't picked up valuable information from ""non-writers"". Whether it be Twitter/Reddit/Facebook/forums/ect.   I wrote about this a while back, but it's disgusting the ""us vs them"" mentality, and my door is always open to questions/comments and I like to incorporate them into my articles. I'm not beneath admitting I'm wrong, and learning things from others. I try to incorporate that into all my writing, whether it be free, or behind a paywall. There is a symbiotic relationship between writer and readership. Writers should be writing to their readerships wants, not making them feel like shit.   MTGprice runs the same risk, if another good finance site has free content, but other monetization strategies, I may be more likely to patronize their business.   That's certainly a possibility, and there's plenty of free information out there (here on Reddit/FB/Twitter/Free-side articles/stock websites/ect.) that one can utilize and be successful. There's more information that is behind paywall, and if you don't feel it's worth it, make your concerns known to the website ownership. The more times it's done, perhaps something will be done about it. I just feel there's a lot of hard work and time/effort put into some of these articles on both free, and paywall'd content.   I doubt very such that it's suicide for QS, since I was one of the original writers behind the QS paywall a few years ago, and their model is still going just fine. Most of the writers at QS pour hours of market research into their articles each week, and I know that the goal for all of us (at least when I was still writing) was to make money for the people willing to read our content. I can say for sure that the material on QS isn't there just to be a cash grab for the site, and that the writers there want to make sure the reader base feels like they're getting their moneys worth on the subscription.   I don't want to come off as someone promoting any site, so i'll be neutral here. I like to think this is true, and writers (including myself) should be striving to make their content worth reading. If the content is free, that's all the more better. If it's behind paywall, it should be worth paying for. I speak only for myself, but I want to contribute to this community as best as I can, and I'm always looking to improve. Writers/readers should have open communication and that's how the content gets better.   I know plenty of writers that put in hours of work, and write way more words than they have to, just to put out good content for their readers (who don't even get paid for it). I think in the end most of us want to help, and not be abrasive to help others in succeeding in this market.  So to sum it up;    Would be appreciated if there weren't blanket statements made.  No ""writer vs reader"" mentality Readers should speak up/comment to make content better Paywall is as successful as an individual makes it. If it's not worth it, speak up; or don't subscribe. Plenty of good free and paywall'd content"
mtgmarketwatch,35204a,ChazVMTG,2,Thu May 7 02:44:33 2015 UTC,"The opening question asked me what my thoughts were of finance pay walls. I gave my opinion that I don't care much for it, and will not subscribe to it because it's not worth it to me. That does not mean I do not enjoy reading the content; the content just doesn't add enough value to be worth paying for because I don't believe the writers are proven.   The problem is, these finance writers are just that, random Joes from around the world writing about basic economics applied to magic. I definitely appreciate them taking time writing quality content, but as I said before, I have not yet read anything ground breaking that I feel is worth paying for. It's not meant to be a disparaging remark against them, but I think it's rather silly to treat the regular writers as the ""George Soros"" of mtg finance. Unless mtg finance has evolved to that of stocks and these writers are the managers of large portfolios of magic card funds for other people, it's hard to justify paying for the content. There's a reason why people pay thousands to go listen to Warren Buffet speak, and not the typical stock market junkie. I respect the time and effort it takes to do the research and write articles, but there's a difference between respect for effort and quality of writing and the respect for inspirational insights from people with proven track records."
mtgmarketwatch,35204a,C_Terror,3,Thu May 7 03:50:05 2015 UTC,"I would reply to only say, please look at the track records of our writers.  They have won Grand Prix, made Pro Tour Top 8s, managed / owned LGSes, etc.  We hire people with credentials (though sometimes we do ""scout"" great unproven talent).  You're paying for the experiences of these seasoned veterans, along with the time they are taking to synthesize these experiences in an easily digestible way.  Hopefully, that's being done in a manner that's worthwhile to you."
mtgmarketwatch,35204a,kellyreid,0,Thu May 7 20:02:54 2015 UTC,"I thought this was well-said, and I agree with everything you said. It's completely understandable that paying for the content is not for you. You also seem (I don't mean to assume, so apologies if I'm wrong) to understand that not everyone is in the same position as you and may not understand how to apply basic economic concepts to Magic, or maybe they're new and want to learn more, or maybe they're interested in the software moreso than the content. Maybe for those people the paywall is worth it.  I get all of that. What I don't agree with is what I see far too often on here people who feel the need to constantly put down the sites and/or trash business decisions they know literally nothing about. Maybe I'm just overly optimistic, but I'd like to live in a world where people can choose not to participate in something without insulting that thing for no reason other than they've chosen to not participate in it.  It's a passionate topic for me because the reason I do what I do is to help people play this game. It's why I've always spoken out against buyouts, it's why I go out of my way to always have free content somewhere, it's why I do giveaways when I can, it's why I always respond to every email and facebook/twitter message, and it's why I've spent way too much time on this thread tonight. I just wish that more of the community could learn to disagree/not subscribe without trashing others in the process."
mtgmarketwatch,35204a,Chosler88,1 point,Thu May 7 08:36:07 2015 UTC,"There is no shame in paywalling content, and as many have said, you pay for what you want. If I think that paywalling is bad, I simply will not pay.  I do have a problem with paywalling FINANCE content.  The fact is, the very act of paywalling already defines the content into the ""us vs them"" mentality. You pay, you are in the club, and you get extra information about the latest trend in buy outs and what not.  What happens when one writer decides, ""hey, today let us hype some random modern tech that is seeing SERIOUS play and is undercosted."" and after a day or 2, releasing a free article saying, ""Look! card X is rising in price due to modern tech, buy now or forever lose to the race!""    Yes it is a sweeping statement, obviously not all sites is going do such things. Yet, the mere existence of paid content already drives the community into 2.    MTG finance, like any other finance is played with real money. There is no such thing as kindness. There is nothing stopping a person from taking advantage of informational disparity and using it to their advantage or helping their clients earn ""money"", effectively securing more subscriptions as it works.  This sub is created due to the main finance thread being locked to approved users only, and as such, a discussion like this would never have taken place.    I am glad to have the chance to state my views and worries about a websites paywalling content for everyone taking advantage of the paywall.  Side note: Also note that the finance community has a huge influence over the everyday man. Check out Tiny leaders. The hype surrounding TL caused many cards to rise up in prices, and as JasonEAltMTG said   More people buy TL cards to spec on than buy them to play with.   could not agree more"

I appreciate your response here, and that you did so in a non-aggressive way, but this statement threw me. I think it's pretty vital to understand that the ""finance community"" has always existed, whether it's stores buying up cards (cough some major stores and Tarmogoyf cough) or laypeople buying every foil Jace in the room at GenCon. The only difference is the people writing finance content have their face and name attached to their work, which in my opinion creates more accountability, not less."

mtgmarketwatch,35204a,rp_1,1 point,Wed May 6 15:08:26 2015 UTC,Honestly I haven't got a problem with it. It's akin to a magazine subscription for me. I pay 5-8$ a month for a several articles a week which is useful.  I don't quite like blocking the forum behind the paywall but it does keep a lot of spam out. The flip side is that there are a lot of content consumers in the forums and very few contributors.
mtgmarketwatch,35204a,GosuMagic,0,Thu May 7 07:29:21 2015 UTC,Why can't you guys post all the paywall stuff on /r/mtgfinance. That sub is spammed full of links so let's keep it all in one and leave this sub alone so we can discuss mtgfinance without having to get click baited into some random site just to find out we can't even read it.
mtgmarketwatch,35204a,BelcherSucks,0,Thu May 7 14:09:42 2015 UTC,"SCG started the paywall because they were providing by far the best content and the most consistent content at the time. For English language articles, it was SCG by miles as sites like TCGplayer.com (formerly Mindripper and Brainburst), Neutral Ground, and others were not great at competing. There were occasional articles of merit on DailyMTG and the other sites, but SCG was so much better that even after the paywall it's free content was comparable to what every else had.   Of course, that was before they became super focused on serialized content and slanted all the casual content onto the free side. Between a deluge of casual articles, a lack of quality features, and an overall apathy SCG slipped in quality. It was still the top dog as all of it's competition also dropped in quality or shut down. It wasn't until CFB formed, with the explicit mission of bringing quality free content to the masses, that SCG wasn't the top dog for free content.  Now do I see a future where all decent content is behind a paywall? Not anytime soon. Streams and video on demand through Twitch provide more content than most major magic strategy sites could curate. YouTube videos, especially by CFB, can provide great strategy and comedy at the same time. Quality written articles are so common now that the days of TheDojo seem quaint (imagine looking forward to a single quality article every couple days). Even twitter (and reddit) can provide quick information that's just as vetted as the paywall sites (scary..)  TLDR - It's a great time for MTG content and some services are going to try to monetize via paywalls but that only opens the market to further competition for the free services."
mtgmarketwatch,35204a,Little_Gray,-13,Thu May 7 05:58:33 2015 UTC,Not much to really say on this topic.  They feel that they have reached the point where they can charge for some of their articles and have done so.  Their followers will determine if it was a good idea or not.    Also you kind of sound like a pretentious dick.
mtgmarketwatch,35262a,mr_tolkien,2,Wed May 6 14:04:31 2015 UTC,I'm in the same boat with tron cards. I've seen people saying a week after release for paper cards and that might essentially be right for online as well as people flood the market after drafting.   I hope someone smarter than me comments.
mtgmarketwatch,35262a,idontknowhowreddit,1 point,Wed May 6 17:20:34 2015 UTC,"Will the market really be flooded though ? 30 tix drafts online will be really expensive, especially with no redeem :/"
mtgmarketwatch,35262a,idontknowhowreddit,2,Wed May 6 21:12:34 2015 UTC,"Flooded was maybe the wrong word. I just meant that supply will quickly go up, so prices should drop a little until demand catches up (which it might never do)."
mtgmarketwatch,35262a,billiam-was-taken,1 point,Wed May 6 21:37:24 2015 UTC,"I may have misread it, but I think MM2015 online is cheaper than paper because of the no redemption. ($6 a pack is what sticks in my mind, but I could be totally wrong.)"
mtgmarketwatch,35262a,sloth_clunk,2,Thu May 7 00:30:11 2015 UTC,"Close, packs will be $7 online"
mtgmarketwatch,35262a,Lachryma_ud,2,Thu May 7 03:51:13 2015 UTC,"I'd put it at about 1 and half to 2 weeks after release. That was around when VMAs got lowest, along with other reprint-type sets. Note that certain card prices refuse to budge, like Force of Will didn't drop below 30 for a long, long time despite increased supply from drafters. I'm guessing Clique might behave similarly, though I imagine Cryptic will drop a decent amount once there's plenty being opened."
mtgmarketwatch,34yvdv,Rock-swarm,5,Tue May 5 18:25:43 2015 UTC,"It is very likely Inkmoth Nexus is not in, as Rosewater said they dropped the infect theme from the set in his article yesterday."
mtgmarketwatch,34z0hf,IgoRStripes,2,Tue May 5 19:02:56 2015 UTC,"I'm planning on playing it safe and hoping that this pulls in more people for modern, obviously it won;t have the impact the first MM set had BUT at the same time there is little risk in buying ravnica modern cards because they won't be reprinted.  I'm picking up hella Abrupt Decays"
mtgmarketwatch,34z0hf,devin93uk,5,Tue May 5 19:34:32 2015 UTC,"It would appear that Infect cards are relatively safe right now as well, as that archetype will not be seen in Modern Masters 2015. Moreover, yes, cards that are from sets outside the range of MM2015 would not be bad pickups."
mtgmarketwatch,34z0hf,Kaono,0,Tue May 5 20:48:10 2015 UTC,"Inkmoth Nexus is sold out everywhere. There are <50 copies left on TCGPlayer. Looks like the new prices is $20+ as people will be building infect en masse with the hierarch printing.   I'd also expect to see Berserk tick up, possibly spike dramatically as its relatively cheap for a such an iconic RL staple."
mtgmarketwatch,34z0hf,gamblekat,1 point,Wed May 6 15:46:52 2015 UTC,"WotC's stated goal with MM is to get more people into Modern, so that people getting into the format will compensate for the supply entering the market. I don't think the effect will be as dramatic as it was after MMA, but it will happen. There's tremendous interest in MM2015, and some of that will translate into new players building Modern decks.  What won't hold its value? (Un)Commons like Remand and Serum Visions aren't going to be >$5 cards with thousands of new copies on the market. Rares from pre-boom, pre-mythic sets like Lorwyn aren't going to be $50 merely because they see 1-2'of use in sideboards. (eg. Leyline of Sanctity, Fulminator) I don't expect the marquee cards like Clique or Goyf to become substantially less expensive."

mtgmarketwatch,34xvdb,jh2015,9,Tue May 5 13:47:44 2015 UTC,I will be interested to see if Oblivion Stone gets reprinted.  Most of the big RG Tron pieces are being reprinted so there might be some money to be made figuring out which pieces do not get a reprint.
mtgmarketwatch,34xvdb,NevPicasso,3,Tue May 5 15:21:21 2015 UTC,"For MTGO Hurkyl's Recall at Rare is going to tank the price, the supply of the card was limited and Vintage players probably already have their copies at this point."

mtgmarketwatch,34xvdb,Sav10r,2,Tue May 5 16:50:41 2015 UTC,"We have a ton of good value commons/uncommons still potentially in the set, while already seeing some good ones like Dismember and Cranial Plating. Off the top of my head:  - Path to Exile  - Inquisition of Kozilek  - Remand  - Spell Snare  - Serum Visions  - Lightning Helix  - any of the Infect pump spells  - Urzalands  - Nature's Claim  - Electrolyze"
mtgmarketwatch,34xvdb,Snow_Regalia,1 point,Tue May 5 17:52:07 2015 UTC,Duno but it already has considerably more value then MM did when it first came out.
mtgmarketwatch,34xvdb,Little_Gray,2,Tue May 5 18:18:56 2015 UTC,Will modern masters contain basic lands or is that the slot that has been taken by a foil?    I ask because with blinkmoth at 236/249 that means there will be at least 19 lands in the set.  Eye of Ugin at 242 means we could potentially still have the future sight land cycle or Urza lands.
mtgmarketwatch,34xvdb,Little_Gray,3,Wed May 6 12:35:38 2015 UTC,I believe that was the foil slot in the original Modern Masters.
mtgmarketwatch,34xvdb,NevPicasso,1 point,Wed May 6 13:26:10 2015 UTC,Does anyone think the Urzalands will be printed in the set?

mtgmarketwatch,34u81g,nathanmasse,2,Mon May 4 16:33:15 2015 UTC,"Nobody really knows because we have no precedent or history to look at.  MM1 was an experiment, and modern wasn't actually very popular at the time.  It landed when a huge surge of players entered magic and the demand increase far exceeded the supplies of modern staples, driving up prices.  MM2 is really different in that modern is now an established format and wildly popular.  The print run is still limited, and that has nothing to do with the players as much as it provides a promise to LGS's that wizards doesn't want to crash the 2nd hand market.  Wizards doesnt set the price of a goyf or a birds of paradise, but they know that if the secondary market loses confidence, they wont buy sealed product.  And retailers are the ones who buy product and resell it to the players.  So we just don't know.  The run will be limitted, but they have a much larger and more stable demand now, so prices could:   Increase as even more people try to enter modern Stay constant plus or minus a few dollars Prices drop a bit Prices crash and modern becomes cheap to enter"
mtgmarketwatch,34u81g,Unknown_Phate,1 point,Tue May 5 03:22:23 2015 UTC,All the rarity shifts are going to make things drop from a cliff.  Examples:  Eldrazi Temple is around $4.  Probably be like a quarter by the time its done with all the uncommons.  Eye of Ugin probably be going from $14 down to $2 card now that its a rare.
mtgmarketwatch,34u81g,b_fellow,1 point,Tue May 5 15:27:27 2015 UTC,Highly doubt it will drop to $2 considering it's a limited set and the MSRP of a pack is $10.00
mtgmarketwatch,34u81g,TabinD3,1 point,Tue May 5 17:37:43 2015 UTC,"I think it's going to tank. It's a 1-of in a deck that's fallen out of favor in the metagame and it's being printed at Rare. Maybe not to 2, but it'll tank.   For comparison:  Academy Ruins went from 13 to 6 after it's MM1 reprint. Glimmervoid went from 16 to 9. Blinkmoth Nexus went from 16 to 8.   All 3 of those lands see more play than Eye of Ugin, their original print runs at rare were of similar sizes to Eye at Mythic in Zendikar, and MM1 had a smaller print run than MM2"
mtgmarketwatch,34u81g,worldchrisis,1 point,Tue May 5 19:44:43 2015 UTC,Oh it most definitely will tank.  $2 seems a bit low though.  I would say anywhere from $4-8 seems reasonable for a card currently priced at $14 with low tcgplayer stock.  It also has some casual appeal.
mtgmarketwatch,34u81g,TabinD3,0,Tue May 5 22:32:32 2015 UTC,"Impossible to tell, modern and all of Magic already hit an explosion of players inadvertently times with the release of the original MM, that likely contributed to the price hike of a lot of the staples (not to Mention the non-existent supply) It's likely that we may not see that explosion again that means we'd probably see much slower growth than we saw in the original version, especially with a larger print run.   Will they ever go above their price again? No one can tell, if in 5 years we continue to see only steady increase in the player base then yes, they will raise in price, but nothing in the history of anything experiences perpetual growth."
mtgmarketwatch,34u81g,TheRecovery,2,Mon May 4 19:47:02 2015 UTC,I support the game so I hope they print more and as often as possible.
mtgmarketwatch,34u81g,GosuMagic,4,Mon May 4 19:49:25 2015 UTC,"I also support the game and generally agree that reprints are very healthy.   One thing you may want to consider, looking at your statement is the general reprint policy in YGO. It takes what you've said to the extreme - in effect taking the popular cards, letting them rise then unexpectedly mass reprinting some of them - and it has irreparably hurt the morale and trust of the player saw as a result.   Wizards has tried this angle (albeit poorly) and the subsequent anger and loss of trust from the player base lead to the creation of the reserve list.  I propose that it is possible to find a happy medium for reprints and support the game as well MM15 seems like that medium so far."
mtgmarketwatch,34u81g,TheRecovery,1 point,Mon May 4 20:14:09 2015 UTC,Yugioh reprinted their rares as commons. That's not what's happening here.

mtgmarketwatch,34u81g,TheRecovery,1 point,Mon May 4 20:04:19 2015 UTC,"Having $50+ cards in a format they're trying to support isn't viable. If they don't drive down the price, the format will eventually stagnate or die."

mtgmarketwatch,34svuo,Rohugh,4,Mon May 4 08:13:21 2015 UTC,"That's what I'm thinking, the lvl 2 judge was saying I should set a price point of when I would sell it.  Say if it ever hits $350 or in a few years, if I'm lucky, $400."
mtgmarketwatch,34svuo,Lollipopsaurus,2,Mon May 4 08:30:21 2015 UTC,"I think that stock of MM2015 is going to be hard to find on day 1, so I'd probably attempt to resell on that day at FNM."
mtgmarketwatch,34svuo,kahluahandcream,1 point,Mon May 4 12:38:56 2015 UTC,"I dunno, even reselling on that day would only net maybe $300 max?  I think they're expecting a big print run on this one."
mtgmarketwatch,34svuo,Sand_Coffin,2,Thu May 7 00:13:31 2015 UTC,"I'd either sell it right away or draft/crack it. So many people sat on Modern Masters boxes expecting a huge return, only to have invested hundreds (or thousands) into them and get very small returns. Considering Modern Masters 2015 is both a larger print run and indicative that Modern Masters sets are going to be on an annual/bi-annual basis going forward, I can't really see any long term appeal in stashing the box just to make a small return."
mtgmarketwatch,34svuo,JDragon,1 point,Mon May 4 20:03:05 2015 UTC,"You bring up a good point. Even if I had picked up MMA with the intention of sitting on it, that's college-student money that would have been better invested in Modern staples that I could actually be playing with rather than just hoping for the best. I picked up two boxes of MMA2 with the intention of sitting, but your comment makes me reconsider. Probably will be more fun to draft."
mtgmarketwatch,34sy3x,13x13-100,4,Mon May 4 08:15:12 2015 UTC,I would say it is more then likely to be reprinted in MM2015.  Last time they printed nearly every high value modern legal common and uncommon in the allowed sets.
mtgmarketwatch,34sy3x,Little_Gray,3,Mon May 4 12:15:27 2015 UTC,"Expecting it will be in at rare, but doubt it'll go under 5 bucks ever - just too constantly played in Modern (and EDH for that matter)."
mtgmarketwatch,34sy3x,pokk3n,1 point,Mon May 4 17:49:17 2015 UTC,"Uh, the meta saturation for Mindcenser in modern is pretty low. Most junk lists would rather run other SB options, and it doesn't really further the gameplans of Soul Sisters or Bogles.  While I agree that the effect is at the rare level for today's power levels, the previous modern masters set showed that WotC is comfortable with uncommons having this effect."
mtgmarketwatch,34sy3x,Rock-swarm,5,Tue May 5 10:34:16 2015 UTC,"Good chance it will be reprinted I think, but I can't help but wonder if it will be put at rare for limited purposes. The hoser ability seems more like something we see at rare these days, like hushwing griff."
mtgmarketwatch,34sy3x,ShoePolice,1 point,Mon May 4 12:34:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it sounds pretty rare by today's standards. But it's almost certainly in mm2."
mtgmarketwatch,34sy3x,mr_tolkien,1 point,Mon May 4 12:41:28 2015 UTC,There is very little fetching in limited the ability would be useless. You'd take it as a money rare.
mtgmarketwatch,34sy3x,Berksmb,1 point,Mon May 4 19:46:58 2015 UTC,There is a chance for stuff like the land cyclers from Alara Reborn being in the set so it would throw off limited as an Uncommon if that was the case.
mtgmarketwatch,34sy3x,BelcherSucks,1 point,Tue May 5 01:58:52 2015 UTC,True buy its a much much narrower ability then that of Hushwing Griff.  There are a ton of cards with ETB triggers but very few with search effects which makes Hushwing considerably better in limited where as Mindcensor a 2/1 flyer for 3 with flash and an ability which will almost never be relevant.
mtgmarketwatch,34sy3x,Little_Gray,2,Mon May 4 19:52:20 2015 UTC,"Spoilers apparently start today, so we'll see.  This is a card that might be promoted to rare given that Hushwing Gryff was rare, and this card has a similar effect."
mtgmarketwatch,34qoh1,kahluahandcream,6,Sun May 3 18:42:38 2015 UTC,"Deck prices have a way of maintaining equilibrium if only a few pieces get reprinted, the staples kind of teeter totter where the cheap stuff gets expensive and the expensive stuff gets cheap. It's supply and demand. The thing with Twin, though, if most of the deck gets reprinted, does the deck get much cheaper overall? Does the wide availability of ""most of the deck"" surge demand as more people try and build it, thus propping up prices? Or do Snapcasters become so prohibitive that nobody builds it? I think it's a combination of the last two. Everyone will have a Twin deck all of a sudden, most of them will be bad versions of it without Snappies."
mtgmarketwatch,34qoh1,jeremiahvedder,2,Sun May 3 19:31:04 2015 UTC,"That's a very good way to put things into perspective. My biggest concern currently isn't in Twin's price dropping a few dollars as much as it is sinking all the money into ZEN fetches just for them to tank later. But when you put it into the context that the deck itself will retain most of the value over time, it does make me feel a bit better about buying into the deck now compared to waiting."
mtgmarketwatch,34qoh1,davekayaus,1 point,Sun May 3 21:54:35 2015 UTC,"You can play the percentages by buying those parts you know won't be reprinted soon (i.e. Snapcaster) and waiting on the rest. You'll get the benefit of any price equilibrium effect that way. If you are planning on using the deck for years to come in a non-rotating format, then taking a few months to build the deck is no big deal, but the financial benefits are real."
mtgmarketwatch,34qoh1,khaaansolo,2,Mon May 4 10:08:21 2015 UTC,"You already list most of the expensive stuff (except for Snapcaster Mage) but yes, if those get reprinted in MM2, they'll drop a bit. Of course, if you buy them in MM2, that's where you get the best value. Also, in Modern, don't think too much about On-color fetches. For years Misty and Tarn were the ONLY blue fetches. But a Delta or Strand can grab an island or Steam Vents just the same."
mtgmarketwatch,34qoh1,CigarPete,0,Sun May 3 20:19:33 2015 UTC,"So I'm not sure yet but I think you just saved me about $200 off the deck price by just running Strands and Deltas instead, haha. I suppose the only real difference between Strands and Deltas compared to Tarns and Rainforests is the inability to fetch basic Mountains/Forests, in which case its kind of a negligible difference not worth the extra money."
mtgmarketwatch,34qoh1,Encendi,1 point,Sun May 3 21:56:18 2015 UTC,"I've been running twin with 4 Strands, 2 Deltas and 2 Foothills for the last couple of months simply because I don't want to shell out for the tarns. Rainforests don't get anything that a Strand/Delta can't get in any case, as the 1 Breeding Pool is the only forest in the deck. When enemy fetches get reprinted, I will grab a playset of tarns for 4 slots, removing the foothills and 2 blue ones. The only real difference I see is 2 fewer ways to fetch up the one basic mountain. The percentages are so small as to really not be worth the money right now."
mtgmarketwatch,34qoh1,Little_Gray,2,Tue May 5 04:07:40 2015 UTC,"If reprinting REALLY bothers you... buy foils.   I've been building Twin over the past few months and I'm probably 50% of the way there. I have a sort of general methodology regarding buying foils that I'll try to explain.   The order that I'm buying the goods (bolded = bought):    4 Foil Snapcaster Mage 4 Foil Lightning Bolt (promo)  1 Foil Desolate Lighthouse 3 Foil Steam Vents 1 Foil Stomping Ground/Breeding Pool (took the breeding pool here)  2 Foil Cryptic Command (debating between new MM and promo)' 1 Foil Vendilion Clique (new art for sure)  3 Foil Spell Snare 2 Foil Electrolyze (promo) 4 Foil Remand (promo) 4 Foil Serum Visions (maybe promo) 4 Foil Exarchs/Pestermites Rest of various commons and such (Roast, Dispel, etc.)  4 Foil Tarn/Misty 4 Foil Splinter Twin   I don't know if you care about foil price analyses, but all of this correlates with regular prices and reprints, so here we go.    4 Foil Snapcaster Mage FIRST -> I'm pretty sure everyone knows at this point that the card is going to be $80 by the end of the year (maybe even more if WOTC does a great job with MM2015 and lowers prices across the board). Where do you think the foil is going to be...? 4 Foil Promo Lightning Bolt -> After I bought these, I completely stopped giving a shit about WOTC reprinting this common. REPRINT THIS TO THE END OF TIME WIZARDS! These promos are only going to go up in price from here on out.  1 Foil Desolate Lighthouse -> INN+ block foils are high priority since MM2015 only covers up to Scars block.  Foil Shocks -> Ditto as Lighthouse. I think these are very likely to spike soon, given their prices haven't budged in over a year and regulars have been creeping up.  Foil MM Stuff (Cryptic down to Exarchs) -> I'll probably end up buying promo Cryptics, even if they're a bit annoying to use sometimes, because the art is unique and I doubt they'll go down over time. I'm waiting for MM because (note this is key), foils often take a small hit when the regular is reprinted. They recover, but there's typically a window of opportunity to buy in. If not, I'll just bite the bullet. Wanted to point that out in case you ever get worried when a foil drops a little post reprint. I mean look at the ONS foil fetches (click Foil underneath the graph). See that dip when KTK hit? And see how it's almost back to where it once was? Damn son, foils are WHACK. I'll be picking up the promo versions of Remand/Electrolyze as well. Spell Snare/Serum Visions/Exarchs/Mites I'll just pick up because they're fairly cheap at the moment. Foil Commons and stuff -> Obviously, priority is given to stuff in print (because you can typically get it for cheaper then) like Roast and such.  Foil Tarn and Misty -> Frankly even if they get reprinted they will be inflated as all hell like KTK fetches (it's either they're inflated or foil shocks are low... keep that in mind) so chances are I will not even be foiling these out. Instead, I may get them altered, which will help preserve value a little. But if I HAD to buy them right now, I'd pick up foils for sure.  Foil Splinter Twin -> I get the feeling WOTC will be reprinting this one as long as Twin remains a popular archetype (so ideally forever) and there is no new art so it might be the alter route here, or I'll actually just tank the cost to pick up ROE foils, not because of finance or anything but I prefer foils of the first printing in general. This kinda applies to Spell Snare/Visions/etc. but they're going to be cheap enough after MM2015 that it's irrelevant to consider.    Quick note here:   Saving (and making) money on Magic is all about timing. So really keep in mind that you WILL pay the price for buying into ZEN fetches early. If you want to save money, then use budget substitutions when possible (I think KTK fetches are fine at the moment) and buy in when the time is right.   Anyways, if you're thinking to yourself, damn I wish I could get all foils but I can't justify spending that much money on cardboard... well, you aren't spending your money on cardboard. You're actually quite likely to make money. I picked up a set of foil Snapcasters during INN for $40-50 a piece. If you'd picked up foil Steam Vents when they were in Standard (pre-spike) you would've made $20 a piece on them, and there's still plenty of time. Ditto with literally every card on this list. Now even if you don't make buckets of money, you'll still be able to sell your deck for at least the amount you paid for it. That kind of peace of mind is worth the higher buy-in, especially when you consider the immense potential upside.   P.S. A quick questionnaire to consider when buying foils:    Did it spike recently?  Is it Reserved List? Is the art unique/is it a promo? How likely is it to see reprint?  How high demand is this card? (please consider this especially when trying to speculate)"
mtgmarketwatch,34qoh1,Demilio55,2,Mon May 4 01:55:26 2015 UTC,I should point out that its really only foil rares and mythics that have a chance to hold their value after a reprint.  Foil commons and uncommons do not hold their price nearly as well and will crash hard.
mtgmarketwatch,34qoh1,Encendi,1 point,Mon May 4 12:34:03 2015 UTC,Sadly the promo electrolyze is not foil.
mtgmarketwatch,34oql5,robotonic,8,Sun May 3 03:26:14 2015 UTC,"I personally feel they will add some protection for a while, until they refine a technique to transfer the holo onto a fake. Im sure they will look in to this as soon as they saturate the market with all these modern legacy and vintage staples they are pumping out. I think foil might be the only way to go to totally avoid forgeries.  Sidenote - This problem we currently have in the community regarding forgeries is supply and demand, if people stopped buying these fakes then they would not put any resources into refining their techniques. I understand a lot of cards are expensive and people cant afford them, so im not against the use of proxies when playing casual games, but proxies and counterfeits are different, dont think they are the same and its ok to buy these forgeries as its going to ruin this great game."

They are no means perfect yet and are still distinguishable, but who knows in a couple of years they MAY be near perfect. If this does happen, I feel people will stay clear of the format, for risk of getting burned in a trade or ebay purchase etc, and end up receiving counterfeit cards. However that is the players, as for collectors I feel graded cards certified genuine will not suddenly crash in price and the market for these will not be ruined, I hope!"
mtgmarketwatch,34oql5,cole04,1 point,Sun May 3 08:51:39 2015 UTC,"I actually think the crowd that legitimately is that worried about counterfeits is small; I see a lot of people posting with the assumption that the legacy market is going to crash due to cheap fake duals from china or whatever, and I have a strong suspicion that this attitude is tainted with self-interest -- if enough people can be convinced that counterfeit dual lands (for example) are a real problem, maybe they will crash and be cheap!   My general thinking is this:  1) Legacy dual lands were printed 20 years ago. Printer technology and global supply chains have come a long way. If someone were going to replicate it perfectly on a large scale it would have happened already.   2) WOTC aggressively hammers anyone who gets caught making counterfeits on the large scale and the risks are very high and real - financial ruin, prison, etc. I've seen guys making boring fun fake proxies on Ebay that aren't intended to fool anyone get shut down."
mtgmarketwatch,34oql5,pokk3n,2,Sun May 3 09:42:05 2015 UTC,Just to speak to your last point.  WoTC can send a CaD order to these Chinese counterfeiters every single day.  It will do nothing.  US IP laws are not recognized or enforced in China.
mtgmarketwatch,34oql5,Nahhnope,-4,Sun May 3 18:37:30 2015 UTC,"There will always be counterfeiting in mtg, and the only way is to make cards affordable, more so than now, so that players do not have to turn to fakes for a playset of tarmogoyfs."
mtgmarketwatch,34oql5,mewcuss,2,Mon May 4 05:20:06 2015 UTC,"this doesn't work like you think. Shock lands showed up in one batch. Those cards are like $10, reprints, and from a large fall set. It's not possible with wizards current business model to reduce the cost of cards below the cost of counterfeiting."
mtgmarketwatch,34oql5,jimini-christmas,3,Sun May 3 10:28:34 2015 UTC,The holofoil stamp is honestly not much of a deterrent. Buy into foils and promos.
mtgmarketwatch,34oql5,Angelbaka,2,Mon May 4 15:33:38 2015 UTC,"This is what I've been doing. Foils and promos typically appreciate more than regulars as well. While it ain't cheap, it's certainly better than being caught with your pants down while the sky is falling."
mtgmarketwatch,34oql5,Encendi,1 point,Sun May 3 04:22:02 2015 UTC,"I think that you should hold.  Most commonly the newer cards are faked, because there are so much more of them and people are less familiar with them.  In the last round of fakes, all of the modern masters editions were copied, not the original printings.  Plus you know and are familiar with the old cards."
mtgmarketwatch,34lp3c,cole04,4,Sat May 2 07:09:14 2015 UTC,I'd hold onto them as long as possible. Sounds like you're using them anyways.

In my opinion, legacy is alive because SCG supports it and even they are running less tournaments for it. I recommend to have your legacy cards rated because it seems like it will soon be for collectors only."
mtgmarketwatch,34lp3c,GosuMagic,0,Sat May 2 12:54:59 2015 UTC,"what happens to the current legacy player base? Growth isn't a requirement for a healthy game. Just look at the mlb. They haven't expanded, but their game astonishingly remains viable."

mtgmarketwatch,34lp3c,GosuMagic,2,Sat May 2 21:48:14 2015 UTC,"My experience has been, when I trade duals and reserved list cards, that I almost always regret it later because I'll be brewing a new Commander deck and wish I still had them. I just don't see them out enough to get back if I trade out of them prematurely."
mtgmarketwatch,34lp3c,jeremiahvedder,3,Sun May 3 19:34:09 2015 UTC,The market is being flood with counterfeits and each new batch has better quality. My prediction is that in a very short time we wont be able to see the difference between a real and a fake card. And nobody will buy duals anymore. Sell them while you can.
mtgmarketwatch,34lp3c,neuro9000,1 point,Sat May 2 08:51:05 2015 UTC,"I did this about a year or so ago.  I bought into other rare foils, like judge promos.  It's just really nice to have something a little more secure (by secure I mean not as easy to copy) for the long term.  I bet they could replicate foils eventually, but I don't see any point as long as normal cards are selling for so high."
mtgmarketwatch,34lp3c,kefkacakes,0,Sun May 3 06:49:35 2015 UTC,"If pre-holos are less secure and modern reprintable holos are more secure, it seems like good investments for the long, long term don't exist anymore."
mtgmarketwatch,34lp3c,remyseven,-1,Sun May 3 20:33:42 2015 UTC,"As a player, if you are using them, keep them.   If your not, sell them to those who will use them. It makes no sense to horde what others can and want to use while making you a profit. It makes the secondary market and player base healthier while hording ruins the secondary market.  As a financier, the only thing I have to say about old legacy and vintage staples/expensive cards is don't horde. If your not playing you have no use in hording. Sell your cards, make your money, and invest that into actual financial things (stocks, ROTH IRA, etc) where the real big money is. Stop dabbling in low money gains and get some steady returns. Its better for both communities."
mtgmarketwatch,34lp3c,150crawfish,1 point,Sat May 2 20:37:22 2015 UTC,"I think I have been misunderstood here on a few points,  1) The cards I am referring to are ""spare"", I have my legacy decks (I do not play vintage) and I will be keeping these decks intact as I love to play them when I get the opportunity.  2) I am not a hoarder, I do not sit on excessive amounts of power, duals or other high value staples, I just happen to have some I am not using.  3) I do not see these cards as investments, I am merely trying to avoid a sudden decline in value. I am trying to retain value which is how I have ended up trading up into these, not to try and make a few dollars profit.  4) Yes perhaps using the words ""long term gain"" was wrong as they do sound like I am trying to make money here. Again I will stress the point I am just trying to retain value and not loose out. Iv included modern staples, foils and sealed product as these would be my trade targets if I was to put these legacy/vintage staples into my trade folder.  Sorry I should have worded the above better.  Thanks for your comments"
mtgmarketwatch,34lp3c,150crawfish,2,Sat May 2 22:02:23 2015 UTC,"OH! Ok. If your interested in retaining the value of your collection, trading into another deck (be it modern, EDH, etc.) or format staples would be good.   The main value of trading into modern is having a deck you'll enjoy. WOTC has shown they are not afraid of printing modern staples, but you can't replace the ability to have a finished deck that you can really enjoy playing. If you have that much extra stuff laying around, you could think about foiling out whatever you decide to move into. Retains value, looks AMAZING, and is something really special to have in a personal collection.   Sorry I took your post in the wrong direction."

In theory the value accounts for reserved list status but I find that is rarely the case, and doesn't account for the relatively higher price certainty.   At this point I wouldn't trade for goyfs at >100 bucks, or Opals >30 due to the impending reprint and uncertainty around just how much product is being printed. But that's just me--I don't like to gamble that hard :)  [[City of Traitors]] specifically on that list is a unique enabler for a number of different legacy decks and on the reserved list. While its price has fluctuated it's tripled in the last couple years and been as high as 90 bucks.  I'd expect pretty close to a 30% premium trading one for non-reserved-list stuff myself."

mtgmarketwatch,34a9m8,Sav10r,2,Wed Apr 29 15:26:06 2015 UTC,Oh man.......  Drafting MM15 could be painful with Twin at Rare if Exarch also gets a reprint as well.   I don't know how viable it will be to just draft combo pieces but it'll probably really really annoying to just randomly die to  Twin+Exarch randomly out of nowhere.
mtgmarketwatch,34a9m8,chanmancan,11,Wed Apr 29 15:40:00 2015 UTC,Exarch at mythic!
mtgmarketwatch,34a9m8,Manadyne,2,Wed Apr 29 16:12:17 2015 UTC,So just like Kiki + Pestermite in the original Modern Masters?  Though if you opened Kiki you could pretty safely be assured that Pestermite would be available at Common.  Exarch at Uncommon will actually make it more difficult to pull off.
mtgmarketwatch,34a9m8,Sav10r,3,Wed Apr 29 16:48:45 2015 UTC,I wonder if it is harder to pull off. What's the math on this?  We have Twin at rare vs Kiki at Mythic and Exarch at uncommon vs Pestermite at common.
mtgmarketwatch,34a9m8,sloneslone,2,Wed Apr 29 17:34:30 2015 UTC,"Ehhh I don't think it will be a big deal.  There's probably a 40% chance someone opens a Twin in a given MM draft.  Probably a 75% chance an Exarch gets opened.  Probably a 30% chance they get opened in the same draft.  Then someone has to probably first pick the twin, play it, then take the Exarch too.  Most people will just rare draft Twin if they open one, and it's not real great without Exarch.  Don't think it will happen enough to be oppressive, I think it will just be cool."
mtgmarketwatch,34a9m8,Little_Gray,3,Wed Apr 29 17:30:05 2015 UTC,It can actually be a sweet bomb in draft especially when you consider how limited removal normally is.
mtgmarketwatch,34a9m8,Rock-swarm,1 point,Wed Apr 29 18:29:56 2015 UTC,Removal options were pretty darn good in the original modern masters. keep in mind that cards like terminate and path to exile are also likely to be in the format.
mtgmarketwatch,34a9m8,Little_Gray,1 point,Thu Apr 30 01:16:51 2015 UTC,I could see them not printing Exarch.  Its not exactly a hard to find or expensive card and the only reason to put it in is if you want the combo.
mtgmarketwatch,345ivk,mr_tolkien,6,Tue Apr 28 13:50:16 2015 UTC,"This would be pure guess but I would suspect it has something to do with the fact that many legacy cards are not really available readily on MTGO.  A lot of relevant cards were available through supplementary products (Masters series I believe?) that probably weren't as popular as main sets, and the main sets that had relevant cards are old enough that they did not exist on MTGO or back then barely anyone used MTOG compared to now."
mtgmarketwatch,345ivk,atriusfox,6,Tue Apr 28 14:46:05 2015 UTC,"Show and Tell, Counterbalance or Entreat   These cards are not widely available. Urza's wasn't drafted that much and when it was it was drafted in the full set. Cold Snap bas barely drafted. Entreat is a mythic.   I think the other side of the equation is people don't think these cards are going to go down. It's perfectly fine to sit on dual in the long run. Fetches and Shocks might get reprinted causing those prices to tank, but legacy stables are largely immune. Not a lot of people are playing legacy, but that doesn't mean not a lot of people lack the cards."
mtgmarketwatch,345ivk,binger5,4,Tue Apr 28 16:17:16 2015 UTC,"Well that's the thing about MTGO - legacy staples aren't immune to reprint. I think the real issue is that MTGO players are more budget-conscious than most competitive players, as well as the fact that the EV for a legacy event is exactly the same as a modern event, with the upside of having a more fluid metagame. Like it or not, legacy is stale as fuck (and this is coming from a legacy player). Brainstorm seeing play in 76% of all top 8 decks is an inbred meta, period. If I was just entering MTGO, and you told me that half the legacy events don't fire while modern and standard have no issue, I would not be making a legacy deck."
mtgmarketwatch,345ivk,Rock-swarm,5,Wed Apr 29 11:12:45 2015 UTC,I don't believe the player pool is small for Legacy. I have all the cards for Legacy but there is no way I can find time to play 4 rounds. The dailies don't fire because it's just too time consuming for the average player. This game isn't just dominated by highschool and college students anymore. There are many players who have grown up and are now juggling work + life. Just give it a few months and mtgo will be fun again. Leagues will be coming back.
mtgmarketwatch,345ivk,GosuMagic,1 point,Tue Apr 28 17:11:37 2015 UTC,"That doesn't really explain why standard and modern events fire with no issue. Time is certainly a consideration, but not when the other formats take exactly the same amount of time.  It's likely a lot of little factors - cost as a barrier to entry, more complicated card interactions, no nostalgia from newer players, and a meta that's been unchanged for about a year."
mtgmarketwatch,345ivk,Rock-swarm,2,Wed Apr 29 11:14:56 2015 UTC,"You're right, the nostalgia comes from the older players like myself. I want to play with the old cards I grew up with. Most new players have never experienced the interactions with the older cards. I implied that the general player base for legacy are older players and we are the ones having trouble playing 4 hour dailies. I don't know how big of a factor this is for legacy not firing but it's definitely part of the reason."
mtgmarketwatch,345ivk,GosuMagic,1 point,Wed Apr 29 13:18:20 2015 UTC,They are expensive because there is very little in the ways of supply.
mtgmarketwatch,345ivk,Little_Gray,0,Tue Apr 28 14:55:01 2015 UTC,"Well, there are tons of FoWs online compared to IRL. It was a MOCS promo last year and it was in VMA. I got my hands on a playset just through drafting and playing."
mtgmarketwatch,345ivk,potato1,2,Tue Apr 28 15:18:25 2015 UTC,"Well, there are tons of FoWs online compared to IRL.   And FoW online is around 1/3 the price of a paper FoW."
mtgmarketwatch,345ivk,Little_Gray,2,Tue Apr 28 17:12:55 2015 UTC,Do you have any evidence at all to back up that statement?  Saying you got your playset just from drafting is pointless.  Guess what I got half a set of power from just drafting so that must mean there is a ton of it out there and it should be dirt cheap.      You picked a really bad card to make an argument about because with the additional printings you mentioned it has crashed in price.   You can literally get a playset of them now for less then a single one would have cost you a few years back.
mtgmarketwatch,345ivk,jestergoblin,2,Tue Apr 28 15:54:21 2015 UTC,"There are only ~279,000 copies of Alliances Force of Will printed.

mtgmarketwatch,33w48p,Berksmb,-1,Sun Apr 26 05:10:43 2015 UTC,If this set is anything like MM1 then your EV is off.  Remember that MM1 only had two mythics per box.
mtgmarketwatch,33w48p,Little_Gray,-3,Sun Apr 26 16:58:26 2015 UTC,I know what you are saying.  What I was saying is that I dont believe its 1/8 packs.  During MM1 we opened 30+ boxes and only three or four of those boxes had more then two mythics.
mtgmarketwatch,33w48p,Little_Gray,3,Mon Apr 27 12:22:50 2015 UTC,Mine had 3. Perhaps you were unlucky. The rate for mythics is 1/8 in every set.
mtgmarketwatch,33w48p,worldchrisis,0,Mon Apr 27 18:00:12 2015 UTC,"The rate isn't actually exactly 1/8, it is for example 1/8.07 for dragons of tarkir. They just say 1/8 because it is a nice rule of thumb approximation. Every rare sheet has 2x of each rare and 1x of each mythic, so #mythics/(#mythics+2x#rares) gives the exact odds of any single pack containing a mythic rare."
mtgmarketwatch,33w48p,RideTheIguana,3,Mon Apr 27 19:01:23 2015 UTC,"If good rares and uncommons are reprinted as well (spellskite/remand/filter lands etc) I wonder how much prices will crash compared to the print run. If the print run is low, will prices not move and will holding the box yield good returns? If the print run is high(as per normal release sets), will the market for reprinted rares crash, and those not reprinted spike?  Seems like most of the speculation relies heavily on the print run of the set, and whether distributors will choke LGSes on stock like during MMA1"
mtgmarketwatch,33w48p,mewcuss,0,Mon Apr 27 19:21:37 2015 UTC,I feel if the ev is too high stores will just sell it equally high to the ev. They can't sell packs for less than their contents is worth.
mtgmarketwatch,33w48p,Berksmb,1 point,Tue Apr 28 04:19:49 2015 UTC,"Why not? If the EV is too high, stores will try to benefit by cracking and selling the singles, not increase the price of boxes."

mtgmarketwatch,33w48p,mewcuss,2,Sun Apr 26 17:13:40 2015 UTC,I agree wholeheartedly.  Especially given that my beloved pod deck was cruelly ripped out of my hands.  I like playing creatures.  I like green.  Goyf is literally all that stands between me and a complete junk midrange deck.
mtgmarketwatch,33w48p,Unknown_Phate,8,Sun Apr 26 17:00:49 2015 UTC,"Interested to hear of your source, or at least his credentials. We all know there is more coming, and having seen the numbers we're getting at my store I can extrapolate how much larger the print run is.  It's still a very long way from there to making an accurate prediction of where 'Goyf is going to go. It's extremely difficult/impossible to predict that right now, and anyone who tells you otherwise is lying."
mtgmarketwatch,33w48p,Chosler88,2,Sun Apr 26 17:09:19 2015 UTC,"The problem with any comment I want to ask you is that the response is the same: ""depends on print run"". Questions i have typed and deleted:   Clique is of more interest to me than goyf, having lower but similar demand to goyf and increasing subsequent to the MM1 printing. the range of goyf falling in price would be somewhere between 10% to 50% (guessing), would you expect the range for clique to be higher? What is the price of a bulk mythic from MM15? That is, a mythic that is not required for 4 of modern play, and is not emrakul? Looking at the eldrazi, elesh norn Iona.    These are all dependent on print run by my thinkings. Agree?"
mtgmarketwatch,33w48p,Volition85,0,Sun Apr 26 17:46:45 2015 UTC,Agreed. To be honest we're going to have to watch prices for a few weeks before we can learn anything.
mtgmarketwatch,33w48p,Chosler88,2,Sun Apr 26 21:15:41 2015 UTC,"This source, lets call them Finn, is an L3 judge for a big name card vendor, who has helped organize and run several GP's, helps with pricing of singles from said vendor, and is privy to the vendor's spoilers and print sizes.  He encouraged me to not buy a box and wait to get the goyfs as singles, as his conservative estimate is they drop to about 130, his generous one down to 90.  I tend to trust his opinion"

Pendelhaven is $8.  If you are going to cash out, factor in postage / time costs, and then realize you might not even be better than where you started."
mtgmarketwatch,33p8me,Grasswalker,3,Fri Apr 24 15:02:03 2015 UTC,"Infect actually is a very good deck right now. It has a roughly 60% win percentage, which is huge. I think you're underselling it"

mtgmarketwatch,33p8me,bfro,2,Fri Apr 24 18:55:59 2015 UTC,Lol the deck is definitely as real as any other T2 deck in the format.. But if you don't play it then why would you be holding onto it? All those cards have only rose recently due to infect being played and putting up results.
mtgmarketwatch,33p8me,carmansandiego,-4,Fri Apr 24 13:32:15 2015 UTC,"nah, its been putting up the same results as it always has been get lucky at an IQ here or there  it's 100% a tier 2 deck, people on mtgsalvation just say it's tier 1 due to the pro-tour appearance.   tom ross hasn't qualified for a PT since, is no longer on the pantheon and has been losing his foothold on the SCG invitational circuit.   but ""pro-tour memory hype"" keeps the deck ""tier 1"" in a lot of peoples minds who have never played a MP glistener elf while the opponent had a foil goyf casted with judge lands like i did at a recent PTQ   but nonetheless i am in quite a profitable position, and the ""market"" out there is running around like a bunch of idiots speculating on a deck they've never played   the boogyman of modern  i don't know if it's worth waiting for modern masters 2 to just dump a bunch of standard and draft players into the format though"

mtgmarketwatch,33hk09,mtd14,4,Wed Apr 22 16:24:39 2015 UTC,"I think the financial implications are if Clique and Goyf are being reprinted, what about ALL of the  other big money cards from the first Modern Masters.   Will Cryptic Command, Swords, and Bob also see a reprint?"
mtgmarketwatch,33hk09,Sav10r,7,Wed Apr 22 16:38:16 2015 UTC,"Yes, No, No"

Since cryptic command is only a rare I could go either way."
mtgmarketwatch,33hk09,Anon_Amarth,1 point,Wed Apr 22 18:22:06 2015 UTC,I could see both. Wizards seems more willing to have colour imbalance at mythic and rare
mtgmarketwatch,33hk09,Anon_Amarth,2,Thu Apr 23 14:14:26 2015 UTC,"It would ruin the limited format if bitterblossom were rare, it's one of those cards where you are WR aggro and when you crack this in pack 3 you snap take it and splash and it makes your deck 2 as good. At rare it would show up in every other draft pod and would be really bad"
mtgmarketwatch,33hk09,Gideon-Jura,1 point,Thu Apr 23 18:01:02 2015 UTC,"I was agreeing that bitterblossom at mythic makes sense. I have lived the dream of two blossoms in tripple lorwyn, that card is a limited nightmare. But I could see both Bitterblossom and Dark Confidant at mythic in MM15"
mtgmarketwatch,33hk09,Anon_Amarth,2,Thu Apr 23 19:36:18 2015 UTC,"My guess would be that the mythics we get will be the praetors, karn, emrakul, tezzert, agent of bolas, mox opal, bitterblossom,  bob, goyf, clique, and one white and red mythic. I doubt they bump twin seeing as it was printed in the era of mythics"
mtgmarketwatch,33hk09,Anon_Amarth,1 point,Thu Apr 23 19:40:31 2015 UTC,"To be fair, the overall card quality for the limited format will be quite a bit higher in MM2015 as compared to Lorwyn draft. Still a super bomb of course, but probably not nearly as unbeatable. People were making similar arguments about keeping Bitterblossom banned in Modern, citing the ridiculousness of the card in previous Standard formats. Well, we aren't going back in time to play that same format, we're in 2015 and card values aren't identical for limited OR constructed. Apples, oranges, pitted prunes, etc."
mtgmarketwatch,33hk09,SolipsisticEgoKing,5,Fri Apr 24 00:20:45 2015 UTC,"Dark Confidant has an unnecessarily inflated price.  Goyf has similar availability and is in every Jund, Abzan, and Rock deck while Bob hasn't been a staple in a high performing deck in years.    It had 0 copies in the Top 8 of any of the Modern Pro Tour, SCG Invitational, SCG Open, or Magic Player's Championships in the past 12 months.  It also only made the top 8 of one GP of the seven that we have had in the same time period.    Dark Confidant is expensive and fun for collectors, but by no means a barrier of entry for people new to modern."
mtgmarketwatch,33hk09,bfro,2,Fri Apr 24 01:21:22 2015 UTC,"Can't the same be said for Clique?  mtgtop8 has it as 1% of the metagame, and only 1 top 8 paper finish listed."

mtgmarketwatch,33hk09,jassi007,3,Wed Apr 22 21:49:16 2015 UTC,"Besides the price tag, Confidant is an iconic black card. He is the embodiment of the black philosophy and players love him. And just because he's fallen out of favour recently doesn't mean that Wizards forsaw this, they likely started working on MM2 as soon as they saw how big a hit the first one was."
mtgmarketwatch,33hk09,Anon_Amarth,4,Wed Apr 22 21:59:11 2015 UTC,Incredible artwork.
mtgmarketwatch,33hk09,bunbunfriedrice,2,Thu Apr 23 00:36:38 2015 UTC,"What's the financial implication of the new border, in light of counterfeit risk?"
mtgmarketwatch,33hk09,potato1,2,Wed Apr 22 19:53:48 2015 UTC,"Just like in previous instances - non-foils take a hit (though exactly how much of a hit depends on MM2015's impact on modern popularity), while foils stall for about 6 months then continue their slow rise."
mtgmarketwatch,33hk09,Rock-swarm,4,Wed Apr 22 16:13:24 2015 UTC,"Financially, this shouldn't effect old printings as much. New artwork + new border should mean a small drop (if any). I expect judge promos to not move at all, as is usual with them. I DO think this will wind up settling somewhere between the old foils and the judge foils. This art is gorgeous and a lot of people are going to want them. Hell, I'm thinking of downgrading judge promos to it myself."
mtgmarketwatch,33hk09,Snow_Regalia,3,Wed Apr 22 18:12:36 2015 UTC,"This shouldn't effect old printings as much   I believe the correct term is ""affect.""  And that's not entirely accurate. This actually has a double death blow aspect to previous, non-judge printings. For starters, it's art is indeed much more appealing than the original art, and as such will be a significant pulling of attention. Hell, I might even want one for my EDH deck with this art.   Second, its print run is far larger than either Lorwyn or MM13. So its supply will greatly increase, and people will try to move their old Cliques into new ones for the new art. I think you're on to something in saying that this price will end up between the old and the judge foil, but it'll have a similar effect to what Sword of Fire and Ice and Sword of Light and Shadow had on their old iterations."
mtgmarketwatch,33hk09,goldenCapitalist,2,Wed Apr 22 20:16:13 2015 UTC,"Phones at work are a bitch, ty for the correction. While I appreciate the new artwork (it might even dethrone the promo as my favorite), you have to remember that ever person has their own opinion, and a significant portion will prefer the old version. Along with that is the fact that MM2015 is in the new borders with the hologram, which some players actively dislike. You can't say how much of it will enter the market, because we have zero knowledge of the print run size. From what I've heard a lot of retailers are expecting even smaller initial shipments than MMA had, with the hope that future allotments are bigger/more than one additional run. But we have zero knowledge currently. Along with that is the increase in pack prices, so we should see a higher price floor than previous packs. Combined I would expect the Lorwyn/MMA printings to exceed the MM2015 printings."
mtgmarketwatch,33hk09,Snow_Regalia,1 point,Wed Apr 22 16:56:52 2015 UTC,"I believe Wizards said that the original MMA was about three times too small. So expect that as a starting point, even if everything doesn't get shipped right away"
mtgmarketwatch,33hk09,Anon_Amarth,1 point,Wed Apr 22 17:55:34 2015 UTC,"Actually, there have been multiple reports that allocations for the largest store levels are at 12 cases, which is about 50% more than the first MMA print run. Also, consider the fact that there are 3 concurrent GPs running MM2015 product for an entire weekend, and you should have a significant increase in availability of this set over the previous incarnation."
mtgmarketwatch,33hk09,Rock-swarm,1 point,Wed Apr 22 18:03:56 2015 UTC,"You're welcome. You're right about the new artwork being a preference thing, but I think it would still have a similar effect to Arcbound Ravager, where the new art/printing still brought the price down significantly, even if they're about twenty cents apart in price these days.  Also, it has been confirmed that MM15 will be a larger print run than MM13. We don't know by how much, but considering MM13 was largely a test printing to see how people would react, and that it was met with huge success, Wizards has upped the printing cycle to cash in further on that success. Again, it may be a preference thing, but I think that this may command a higher price than the old ones, at the very least be on par."
mtgmarketwatch,33hk09,goldenCapitalist,1 point,Wed Apr 22 18:26:38 2015 UTC,EDIT: Ignore me.
mtgmarketwatch,33hk09,ElvishJerricco,2,Thu Apr 23 14:58:44 2015 UTC,"Prior evidence from other cards that have had similar reprintings with new art seem to suggest a few things. One, if the art is more liked, it will command a higher price than the originals (Swords of F/I, L/S). Two, if it's not significantly more liked or it's moderately disliked, it will have a similar price to the old copies (Bob and Ravager). So it'll likely either be even or above."
mtgmarketwatch,33hk09,goldenCapitalist,1 point,Wed Apr 22 18:30:48 2015 UTC,... That has nothing at all to do with my comment. EDIT: Oh I see. I should have been more clear. There's no data to suggest that MMA 2015 will have a print run whose size comes even close to matching Lorwyn. But it seems that either you editted your comment or I misread it because your comment doesn't make that claim.
mtgmarketwatch,33hk09,ElvishJerricco,2,Wed Apr 22 19:47:11 2015 UTC,"My comments aren't edited, but I do think (even though I don't have access to data that can prove it) that MM15 will have a larger print run than Lorwyn.   My logic runs like this. Each new first set for Standard gets a larger print run than the set prior. So Lorwyn was smaller than Alara, which was smaller than Zendikar, which was smaller than Scars, which was smaller than Innistrad, and so on and so forth, cumulating ultimately in our current ""Most opened"" set, Khans of Tarkir. I think that, given the growth of the popularity of Modern, plus the much larger magic player base since 2007 (over eight years, it's not unreasonable to claim that Magic has grown by millions of players) would push Wizards to make even smaller summer sets (MM13, Conspiracy, MM15) readily available. I think if you tried to make a print run of something the size of Kamigawa, Ravnica, Lorwyn (just to take an example) you'd run out super fast, and prices would inflate greatly (See Modern Masters 1). I think that by upping the price to $10/pack MSRP, Wizards signals that they are trying to keep the ""premium"" level of the packs while significantly raising the print run quantities to overall depress prices of Modern staple cards. So overall, I think that, though I can't prove it, I can say with confidence that MM15 will likely be printed on a wider scale than older sets like Lorwyn."

mtgmarketwatch,33hk09,khaaansolo,1 point,Wed Apr 22 20:16:22 2015 UTC,"More Cliques are always better, it seems.  But, if you were someone like me, who is more of a player than a collector, I only need the Cliques I use, which wouldn't even be a full playset (One for an EDH deck, 1-2 for UWR Control in Modern, that's about it). So if I did have old Cliques right now, I'd sure as hell try and get rid of them for this new one."
mtgmarketwatch,33hk09,goldenCapitalist,1 point,Wed Apr 22 20:43:26 2015 UTC,Clique is one of my favorite cards of all time.  I won't sell even knowing that the value is going to take a hit.

mtgmarketwatch,33j0x7,omegaorb,3,Fri Apr 24 22:46:17 2015 UTC,"Esper dragons did VERY well at the Asia GP, so while there's a chance it's buyout, I would pin it more likely on people wanting to play what they believe is the top deck in the format, be it U/B or Esper dragons."

mtgmarketwatch,33j0x7,Little_Gray,1 point,Wed Apr 22 22:35:51 2015 UTC,You have to take the entire set into consideration.  The current EV for Dragon of Tarkir is not sustainable and something has to give.

mtgmarketwatch,33j0x7,khaaansolo,1 point,Thu Apr 23 22:27:02 2015 UTC,"I wonder what the ramifications of buyouts like this can cause for standard sets.

mtgmarketwatch,33j0x7,cybrcld,2,Wed Apr 22 23:25:17 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. To be exact, after the volatility of the pro tour dies down, you now have cards at settled prices.

In modern he is fringe at best, and in legacy he has a home in maybe 1 and a half decks (jund, some versions of BUG delver) where most decks play cards like sylvan library/miris guile instead (actually better with fetches than Bob).   Its current price tag is way to high, but he won't dip for reasons you gave are spot on. Price memory is dumb, but its a thing."

mtgmarketwatch,33dosn,Little_Gray,5,Wed Apr 22 17:06:13 2015 UTC,Apparently Modern Jund was never a thing? Bob was a staple 4-of in every successful Jund list for over two years. The deck was so dominant that Deathrite Shaman and Bloodbraid Elf were banned. #HistoryLesson
mtgmarketwatch,33dosn,SolipsisticEgoKing,-4,Wed Apr 22 18:22:57 2015 UTC,I think you need to go back and get a history lesson yourself.  Jund was a tier one deck for six months or so.  Also Deathrite was not banned because of Jund as jund was a fairly mediocre tier 1.5 deck at the time.    Most of the time when a deck with bob becomes tier one he ends up getting cut for better cards because he is just not that good.

mtgmarketwatch,339gy8,Encendi,3,Mon Apr 20 18:40:36 2015 UTC,"To correct you on Snapcaster, once he climbed from $30 to $50 the foil saw a jump from $120 to $140.   As for Huntmaster, he doesn't perform enough in the CMC 4 slot in Modern. Jund, already performing poorly against Abzan decks, wants something more than Huntmaster. He will be forever $6 most likely, and his foils at what they are now.  Again about Jund, it's not what it used to be. It may run an Olivia or two, but seeing play in a not-so-great-anymore Modern deck as a 1-2 of hardly makes for in-demand foils. Take a look at Sphinx's Rev for example, played as a 1-2 of in UWR Control, still only $24 for the foil.   Got any sources on Merfolk now being a better deck? And in what format?  Shocks dropped a long time ago, not sure where you're getting that from. They've stayed roughly steady in price for the past 6 months or so (with the exception of Steam Vents.)  Abrupt Decay foils won't be gaining until the normal ones spike, and even then it may be a little iffy. The multiplier for foil prices on Decays is already very high, I'm not sure that a normal Decay going up to $20 will mean that a foil one will become $100."
mtgmarketwatch,339gy8,goldenCapitalist,4,Mon Apr 20 22:55:57 2015 UTC,"Excellent! I wanted to encourage discussion on these specs, considering that people have been advocating buying into stuff like SCM, Voice (oops, that should probably be on the list), etc. for the past several months since MM2015 will not be covering anything past NPH. So here are my responses to all of your points.    Snapcaster - Well, technically you are correct if we look at TCG. However, I'd like to point out that pre-Treasure Cruise Snapcaster foils were even higher than they are now. They began to slide after TCG pushed Snappy out of the metagame and I imagine people were not keen to buy in. It seems like the current price is correcting back towards the old one and I wager, will even supersede it. My gut tells me that WOTC does not want Splinter Twin to be the only ""Control"" deck in Modern and that we'll be getting some tools over the next few months. Even if we don't, it's still likely that regular Snapcaster will hit $80 by the end of the year and foil prices will probably hit $170-200 in my opinion. I am hesitant to suggest anything higher, given that Bob is a $175 foil, although a resurgence in Modern demand might make it happen.  Huntmaster - I think you're underestimating Huntmaster a bit. He's a house against Junk since he's an instant 2 for 1. Even if we disagree on this point, I already mentioned that his fate is tied to the performance of archetypes that want to run him. I think he's a decent bet, given he's a mythic from Dark Ascension and a flip card, so he likely won't see reprint.  Olivia - I think you're giving Jund less credit than it's worth. I'd say it's a T1.5 deck and that the choice between Jund and Junk is dependent on the metagame. Olivia is a popular EDH card and a surge in Jund's (or even Grixis's) performance could see a massive increase in price. She certainly has the raw power level to get there. Cavern - I've been following States and it looks like Merfolk's been overperforming at 4.5% of the metagame, beating out a lot of decks that I think would usually have taken their spot (Scapeshift, Tron, etc.). Cavern is also a casual and EDH staple, although I'd say it's probably the weakest of the specs on this list since it's already been seeing significant growth. Shocks - I think I may have mistyped about the shocks. What I meant to say was that they spiked mid-Standard and then they fell back down a bit and stagnated for the past year. Additionally, while regular Steam Vents went up, foil Steam Vents seems like it stayed the same.  Abrupt Decay - Foil Abrupt Decay does have a large foil multiplier, I agree. But it has slid down from where it was a few months ago and I think a buy in might not be too bad for a long term hold. Also, I think you're slightly twisting my words. I never claimed to say that foils grow proportionally to the regular card- I think foils grow at some unique proportion that varies from card to card and thus can be very volatile (and represent great profits).    I have a few criteria for evaluating specs in general.  Number one, is when it seems like the price is lagging behind somewhere. So for example, when Volc and Sea spiked a year ago, Trop didn't budge so I bought into them. I think Snapcaster foils fit the bill, since it's actually quite rare for foils to increase relative to the normal price, from my experience. Usually it's a 2-3x multiplier relative to the increase.   Two, a more ""speccy"" card needs to see play in multiple formats. Olivia and Cavern are good examples of these. I'd argue that both cards deserve slow upward trends independent of the play they see in Modern. If they start to see significant competitive play, then that slow upward trend can turn into a rocketship.  Three, I like the buy-ins and power level on Huntmaster and Olivia. The buyins are fairly low, even for cards that are only played in one or two decks, and both cards are certainly very strong.   Four ties in with three- Dark Ascension was a much less popular set than INN and box values reflect that, so Huntmaster has that going for him since if he spikes his price could prop up the price of DKA boxes. I'll add in Voice in the OP since it's another example of a low supply mythic that could see potentially huge gains.   Five, safety. All of these specs are relatively ""safe"" from a reprint perspective. Snapcaster and Decay are the safest of the lot, given that they are both huge staples in multiple formats.   And finally six, sometimes you gotta look at it from a play perspective. Perhaps as a pure spec, Huntmaster would not look amazing, but if you're playing Jund then it's a card you can justify holding it for sure. Ditto for the rest- at the very least, you will not be losing any value on any cards on this list and if you're playing them you're gaining intangible value. This is something I should have been very clear on. Recently I haven't been doing a lot of pure speculating and instead I've been purchasing foils for my personal use, in particular focusing on ones that could see potential growth in the future. I imagine that this is actually probably the place where most competitive players are in- not to make big bucks necessarily but to preserve the value of their collection so they can cash out down the line if necessary.   Now it might seem like my evaluation is a little bit inconsistent since not all the cards on my list fit into all the categories, but a card doesn't need to have everything going for it to be a good spec. I'd probably rate the specs like so...   Snapcaster  Shocks  Olivia Abrupt Decay Huntmaster Cavern   Voice, once I add him in, would go above Olivia."
mtgmarketwatch,339gy8,goldenCapitalist,2,Tue Apr 21 02:14:05 2015 UTC,"I have to apologize and thank you. When I first came across your thread, it honestly looked rather poorly written, filled with unsubstantiated conclusions that looked like just some guesswork about cards that you're currently holding and hoping to go up.  But this response is really what I was looking for, so thank you! It's very well thought out. You are right, I was being a little unfair to Jund, but I think that it needs a little more bite than Huntmaster of the Fells. I don't think it's a bad card, it's just not good enough for Modern Jund in my view. Some cards you mentioned I think are long-shots, like Olivia and Huntmaster. I think their playability is really limited to the formats that they already have ample copies of (EDH and a splattering of Modern) and I am not sure they'll be in much higher demand any time soon. I also doubt that Grixis control, forever a T3 deck in Modern, will be going places if even UWR control isn't going places at the moment.   If we're talking long shots here, then I'd like to see the new control goodies Modern gets be JTMS. I sincerely think it'll be the one card that makes normal control highly competitive without enabling combo (one card currently in existence). Obviously if it's made legal in Modern it'll be worth more than Goyf is now, which is something Wizards may not want, but on the flipside it would make every other part of UWR control much cheaper! Because that's how economics works!   Anyway, I have very large sums of money invested in Snaps and Shocks, so I'm on boat with you there. I'm not sure Snaps will hit $80 any time soon, so I plan to unload them in October/November (when I expect them to be about $60-70, as they say, always leave 10% for the next guy.) Voice, I'm not sure, depends on his playability now that Pod is gone in Modern. Cavern I think is the kind of land that can easily be reprinted in other sets, so I doubt its growth will be much more than it already is.   That's my expanded take."
mtgmarketwatch,339gy8,goldenCapitalist,2,Tue Apr 21 05:38:17 2015 UTC,"No worries, honestly I posted this for discussion (and thus did not include what I personally bought into), especially since I've been seeing a lot of these cards suggested to people to hold, both on reddit and at my LGS. I really appreciated your post for calling me out on these specs, because now people can see both sides of the analysis of these cards. But here are my actual purchases...  Stuff I have personally bought in:    4 Foil Snapcasters 3 Foil Huntmasters    Stuff I'm looking to buy in:    Foil Steam Vents, Foil Breeding Pool, Foil Stomping Ground   Stuff I'd buy in if I wasn't liquidating most of my collection    Voice  Olivia   Stuff I'd only buy if I was looking to play the decks (i.e. they aren't bad specs per se, but not as good as the ones above):    Cavern Abrupt Decay   I'd say I'm kind of biased in favor of Huntmaster, given how much he destroyed me in RTR/INN Standard and because I'm building RUG Control. Huntmaster is key to my plan of grinding out GBx decks so he's actually irreplaceable there.   Olivia is a long shot as well, but again, I mentioned that as foil mythics from INN block, any amount of play could be enough to skyrocket them to the top. The thing about Olivia is that she dies to Bolt, but you never want to play her when both you and your opponent have tons of cards in hand. I see her as a way for Jund to really grind out Twin and Junk decks late game because if you can untap with her you win. Also, I'd say that Grixis is actually better positioned than UWR at the moment. I browsed a number of high placing Grixis lists at SCG States. They've made use of new tools like Tasigur and other stuff and basically improved their Twin and GBx matchups at the cost of Burn, while UWR kinda folds to GBx and can't pressure Twin early enough.   JTMS would be awesome in the format, but I'm also in line with your thinking that he would be horrendously expensive. I'm not sure he would make the rest of Control cheaper; I've noticed that cards come down a lot slower than they shoot up and frankly Control players have the biggest wallets so I think stores will try to keep the rest of the staples where they are. I think the biggest barrier to his unbanning is price more than anything at this point. I could see an Ancestral Visions or Ponder/Preordain unban but not Jace. WOTC doesn't want Modern to get its first $500+ card.   The only thing I'd be cautious of in regards to Snaps/Shocks is counterfeits. I know they've been hyped and re-hyped over the past few months, but I've seen some and they are the real deal. I'm not a dealer, but I'm a pretty experienced trader/player and frankly I wouldn't notice if someone played even a shitty fake across from me at FNM, let alone the ones that are being carefully cross-examined in the main subreddit. And that's what matters- not whether I'd get scammed in a trade or sale, but whether the guy in front of me would choose to buy a $5 fake over a $60 real card to play at FNM. Still, I don't think the Magic apocalypse is quite here yet, so if you're going to unload Oct/Nov (is that GP season?) I don't see any problems. But going forward, I personally am not putting any money into big older cards like I have in the past.   Voice, if I had some extra money, I'd bet on. I feel like Little Kid/Collected Company builds are missing one piece and if they can get it they will definitely do well. Cavern, well, like I said, I wanted to encourage discussion since I've seen too many people just blindly trade for anything that's remotely a staple in INN/RTR."
mtgmarketwatch,339gy8,yavimaya_eldred,2,Tue Apr 21 09:46:40 2015 UTC,"I played Naya Blitz in RTR/INN, but that doesn't mean I'm suddenly gonna go buy Burning-Tree Emissaries and Champion of the Parishes and Mayor of Avabrucks =P (also I loved that deck, I think I may put it back together just for shits and giggles).   I think that Grixis tends to fail a bit harder in matchups against things like GBx than UWR does. Sure they have access to their own Thoughtseizes and such, but being able to lightning helix your Lingering Souls tokens, or cast Supreme Verdict on a crowded board, or most importantly, use Celestial Colonnades as beaters, is something that has always made UWR intrinsically strong. I also don't think the deck automatically folds to GBx, at the moment it's just an uphill battle because of Abzan's new toys (Rhino). Also Twin is pressured just fine early game. UWR runs 4 bolts and 3-4 Helixes and 2-4 Electrolyze and 3-4 Path to Exiles, on top of Mana Leaks, Cryptic Commands, and sometimes Remands. I'm pretty sure killing your dude before you get a chance to copy him is no problem for UWR.   Likewise, UWR has a stronger matchup against more aggro decks like Affinity. Sitting there being able to go Bolt your first guy, Helix the second, Snap back Bolt, then Mana leak Path, Cryptic command all your guys down and bounce my Snapcaster, Snap back Cryptic to do it again for another turn (essentially a time walk for you), and then Supreme Verdict... that's a rather harsh lockdown for Affinity, one that I have done (and been done to) many times (I've owned and played both decks).   Shock counterfeits matter less because there's such a high volume of them in the market, and they're worth comparatively little. Why make a fake $8 card when you can make a fake $50 card? I also do think fakes have been overhyped. I don't think they are as worrisome as some are led to believe.   Ancestral Vision wasn't unbanned when Treasure Cruise was banned. Ponder and Preordain are too powerful for combo - it would make Twin and Storm far too good decks. Burn would probably go back to playing three colors again. None of these cards are healthy for Modern because they make combo too powerful, and do not do enough for hard control. JTMS helps turn on hard control (the kind that sits back and is reactive to whatever you try to do) because he is basically useless in those combo decks mentioned above. He wouldn't go anywhere except the Control decks.   As for the price of cards, I think it's not entirely correct to just assume that ""Control players usually have more money."" I can say for sure that's not true, considering it costs nearly two thousand to play Abzan or Jund, and less than half of that to play UWR control. Likewise it costs about $600 to play Affinity, which is withing $100 of the cost of UWR control, depending on your build. If JTMS did get unbanned in Modern, his price would go up, but it wouldn't put UWR control out of the price range of all other decks. You can observe price trends correlated with mana bases. If the mana bases get cheaper, the nonlands get more expensive, to maintain a certain parity in the value of the deck. Likewise, if certain nonland cards got more expensive, other cards would get less so. S if JTMS suddenly became a $200 card, you could expect Cliques and Cryptics to suffer a bit in price (long-term) for the deck to maintain a rough parity (albeit an increased one) of value."
mtgmarketwatch,339gy8,Snow_Regalia,2,Tue Apr 21 15:20:46 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with your point about Standard performance not indicating that much, but I think that it does indicate something. Burning Tree does see a bit of play in Modern Gruul/Zoo aggro and if Humans was a thing Champion would as well. But anyways my main point was just saying I bought them mainly because I was going to play with them + I thought they were a decent investment. I perhaps wouldn't have bought in if I wasn't going to use them.  You know, I used to agree with you on Grixis but I bought into Grixis Delver recently on MTGO and it has a surprising amount of game against GBx. The black splash gives you access to Murderous Cut and Terminate and I'd definitely rather be doing that than giving them access to more mana via Path. Tasigur's ability is surprisingly relevant in the late game and you can get your threats down for way cheaper than UWR can, and thus hold up countermagic.   As for UWR vs. Twin I think it depends on the version you're looking at. The Geist/Midrangy version seems better positioned against Twin than the all out Control version, but even then I'd rather tap out for 1 for Tasigur on T3 while holding up Remand/Leak (or even better, Goyf!).   I do agree that UWR has a better Affinity matchup, but I think both decks have the tools to deal with Affinity and I don't think it's such a big difference between the decks.   About the shocks, as much as it doesn't make sense to fake $8 cards over $50 cards, fake shocks are a part of the counterfeiters' lists. As for them being overhyped, I said that I personally can't tell the difference on the good ones but even if you don't believe that from me, you should still believe that they'll look perfectly normal sitting across from you at FNM. If you play for the sake of competition and not for collection, then it seems much more reasonable to buy some fakes over real cards if you can get away with it- not necessarily trading or selling them, but just at local events. And that still affects the sellers' bottom line since now they have a smaller market.   I do agree with your point about Jace being only for Control decks, but again I don't think the issue is about power level (as I've never even played against the card) but rather the price.   I suppose your point about deck prices make sense if we assume that long term Modern cards go up over time. I could see Clique/Cryptic stagnating at the prices they are now if Jace became a critical expensive component of Control decks. But regardless I don't think they'll go down, because you have to consider that there is a fixed supply and there's demand for the cards. That was the point I was trying to make about Control players usually having more money. I think Control players are a certain subgroup of players who are comfortably shelling out for a deck if it means they get to play Control, whether that cost is $200 or $2000. That's been my experience.   Also I know you were using JTMS's price of $200 as an example, but frankly I would seriously doubt it settling that low. I'd have to guess at least $300."
mtgmarketwatch,339gy8,goldenCapitalist,1 point,Wed Apr 22 02:06:47 2015 UTC,"Just my two cents, Huntmaster is also played in versions of Temur Twin and Scapeshift occasionally. And Merfolk has done fairly well on the SCG circuit lately."
mtgmarketwatch,339gy8,Snow_Regalia,1 point,Fri Apr 24 17:17:13 2015 UTC,"I disagree with all of your points.    Huntmaster overall has a fine place in Modern. A card being suboptimal in one matchup does not make it bad, and even in the Junk matchup it isn't useless, as trample v tokens is extremely relevant.    In addition to that, Jund as a whole just got an insane addition in the form of Kolaghan's Command. People haven't quite caught on yet with just how insane it is, but the card is absolutely huge for the deck.    Merfolk has gained a large amount of popularity as well as meta share recently in Modern. Tournament results and overall data back this up.    Overall shock prices have held steady. None have dropped. Foils have slowly been rising, and if MM2015 gets another large portion of players into Modern, expect shocks to move as people acquire what they need.    Abrupt Decay sees more play than Snapcaster Mage, in larger quantities, and Snapcaster was $115 foil while it was $20 nonfoil. Even at a 4.5x multiplier, it's still probably too low for what the card is."
mtgmarketwatch,339gy8,goldenCapitalist,2,Tue Apr 21 03:06:02 2015 UTC,"Can I get stats on your claims here? Where are those tournament results for Merfolk? And I don't mean just MTGO dailies; those don't count for much. Likewise statistics for Snappy/Decay use.   I currently have a large sum of money invested in shocklands, and can tell you with absolute certainty that over the past six months, in having kept track of the individual shock prices (foil and non-foil), foils have not been slowly rising. One week they'll be up, and another week they'll be down, always staying within $2 of their average value.  Also, Huntmaster sees play in only four placing decks according to MTGStocks. I didn't say he was bad against Abzan, I said Jund does poorly against Abzan in general, and Huntmaster is not good enough to be played in Jund."
mtgmarketwatch,339gy8,Snow_Regalia,1 point,Tue Apr 21 04:56:48 2015 UTC,Stats for Most Played Cards in Modern. Stats for Most Played Cards in Legacy Here are plenty of Merfolk finishes.
mtgmarketwatch,339gy8,goldenCapitalist,2,Tue Apr 21 12:18:11 2015 UTC,"To me it looks like in Modern, Snappy sees more play than Decay. And even though Decay sees more play in Legacy, it's only in 2% of more decks. Also, Legacy is a far smaller format than Modern, with far fewer players. I think all you've done here is simply proven my point.  Also, these top finishes are rather paltry for Merfolk in Modern. Ten top 8 finishes over the past several months. Just ten. That's rather fringe, and not really representative of the kinds of meta you'd find elsewhere in the us United States. State championships are rather small in attendance, which allow for the more strange decks and niche decks (like Grixis Delver in Delaware) to take the day, because they're not burdened by as much top competition as you would be at higher level events. Basically, I think all you've shown me here is that Merfolk is ""a"" deck that is basically tier two or three. If you look at top 8 Abzan and Affinity finishes, each have over thirty and twenty, respectively. Merfolk can't compare even to these two decks, and that's not even including Twin or other popular Modern decks. Merfolk isn't abruptly ""gaining popularity"" or anything of the sort, it's just perfectly mediocre."
mtgmarketwatch,339gy8,nathanmasse,0,Tue Apr 21 15:00:55 2015 UTC,"A) Look at the numbers of each card played. Between the two formats, Decay has a full half copy more than Snapcaster in the decks it is played in. Additionally, note the price difference. Snapcaster is 4 times the price of AD. If the regular rises, the foil will rise with it.     Basically, all you've done is choose to dismiss results. No one ever said Merfolk was crushing the format, the post was that Merfolk is a deck rising in popularity and results, and it is doing so in both. You holding the deck to your own personal standard of what is and isn't valid results has no bearing on the actual facts, which shows the deck has a rising meta share and is doing well in the metagame."
mtgmarketwatch,339gy8,Cr0c0d1le,1 point,Tue Apr 21 15:33:30 2015 UTC,"You're making exaggerated claims here. There's no hard evidence Merfolk is a rising deck. There's just evidence that it sees some play, which I'm not debating. I'm not dismissing results, I'm poking holes in your argument.   As for number of each card played in a deck, just because Mono B 8-rack in Modern plays 4-of Raven's Crime doesn't mean Raven's Crime is suddenly going to be a $10 common. Looking at just that is a false way of saying a card sees more play than another card. You need to look at the % of decks that play it. Even if Decay is played slightly more in Legacy, it sure as hell isn't in Modern. I don't see four Mainboard Abrupt Decays in GBx decks most of the time, but I do sure as hell see four MB Snappys. Comparing the two cards like this isn't accurate."

mtgmarketwatch,3311p9,150crawfish,2,Sat Apr 18 13:53:43 2015 UTC,Icefall Regent is worth as much as Frost Titan was during most of his initial standard run ($3-6) except for a few spikes over $10. I don't think the $4-5 price will be here to stay.
mtgmarketwatch,3311p9,BelcherSucks,0,Sat Apr 18 23:02:33 2015 UTC,By that do you mean that you expect it to rise or fall?

mtgmarketwatch,3311p9,darnitskippy,1 point,Sun Apr 19 21:17:17 2015 UTC,I think it should settle around $2-3. If it rises too much then I'd dump them as it will go down. I wouldn't be shocked if WOTC puts it in a supplemental product.

mtgmarketwatch,330wj5,Lollipopsaurus,4,Sun Apr 19 01:02:25 2015 UTC,Go look up old foil fetch prices. Pretty much the only info you should actually need.
mtgmarketwatch,330wj5,4channeling,2,Sat Apr 18 13:03:29 2015 UTC,"Surely with the larger print run, the larger player base and whatnot these fetches won't reach that level, lets get a bit more specific.  How much room do you think the foil fetches have to grow?"
mtgmarketwatch,330wj5,Little_Gray,2,Sat Apr 18 13:09:36 2015 UTC,"After Zendikar, people correctly predicted that if modern became popular, fetchlands would be in high demand.  We've seen the prices of those cards skyrocket in response to demand for modern decks.  This likely won't happen again.  It's tough to predict the ""by how much"", but the only real growth you'll see in KTK foil fetches will come from growth in the playerbase overall, not the creation of a new, exciting format like the last ""fetch spike"". Wizards has reported that the growth of the playerbase as slowed down in the last year.  Assuming BFZ reprints Zendikar fetch lands, we have 10 fetchlands with high supply in the ""non-rotating"" format that Wizards wants to promote.    Having said that, I don't think we'll see a huge jump in fetchland prices similar to what we've seen before because the influx of players into any format won't be as drastic.    Having said that, foil KTK fetches (especially the blue ones) will continue to hold value until they are reprinted again or a better land suite comes along, but any growth in price will be slow."
mtgmarketwatch,330wj5,Little_Gray,1 point,Sat Apr 18 16:05:44 2015 UTC,"The print run should roughly reflect demand. How much, is really a meaningless question without a time horizon."

Considering hatebears is starting to move to a lower number and relegate them to the SB, the price is only sustained due to the rarity of FS cards, rares and uncommons alike. Any reprint will absolutely nuke the value of the current ones, new frame or not."
mtgmarketwatch,32yv9o,Naltoc,2,Sat Apr 18 07:32:06 2015 UTC,Tombstalker got a reprint in the first mma. It's probably a fairly reasonable comparison.
mtgmarketwatch,32yv9o,jimini-christmas,2,Fri Apr 17 23:37:04 2015 UTC,"Maybe, but Tombstalker doesn't see as much competitive play as Mindcensor does it? Also I would think it has a lot of EDH appeal too to help is price.   How much value did the foil Tombstalkers lose when MM2013 dropped?"
mtgmarketwatch,32yv9o,ShoePolice,1 point,Sat Apr 18 00:26:23 2015 UTC,I think is also matters a lot if it gets reprinted at uncommon or rare. I would assume rare this time around but at uncommon the price would surely take a big hit.

mtgmarketwatch,32wglh,guard5,2,Sun Apr 19 06:02:33 2015 UTC,Likely around 15%. The increase in supply is going to be slightly offset by players finally pulling the trigger on completing their affinity deck.

The thing that makes foils so particularly difficult to COUNTERFEIT is that if you look closely at a foil, certain parts are more shiny than others. This is known as foil isolation.  As of now, I'm only aware of one person in the proxy/alter community who has gotten this figured out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5LQiRdcb0g  And then you have the holographic mark which potentially complicates things even further. Foil counterfeits produced en masse may never be a reality because they're just way too much work and no one has the hardware or the foil masks (black and white image to represent transparent and opaque ink) to do them properly."
mtgmarketwatch,32v4z3,RZephyr07,1 point,Fri Apr 17 02:47:37 2015 UTC,What makes me worried is the fact that someone from the proxy/alter community figured it out. I get the feeling that the Chinese counterfeiters have access to more resources than the average artist.   I was hoping that buying older foils would be a safer investment than buying the regular cards (plus there are a number of cards that have seen gains on their regular but not their foils). I guess we're just going to have to wait and see.
mtgmarketwatch,32v4z3,RZephyr07,1 point,Fri Apr 17 03:10:46 2015 UTC,"Because the foil isolation masks aren't readily available and need to be recreated, I'm thinking that counterfeiters are going to invest their resources in perfecting non-foils... that's where you're going to see the counterfeits.

The old cards looked great, but they are the ones likely to be scrutinised the most in a trade, and they are different. Very good but not good enough thankfully.  I own a real revised demonic Tudor but wasn't able to say what was wrong with the fake until we put them side by side.  I don't have a great eye for detail but within a few seconds spotted some mistakes on the fake (mainly type setting).   There is a lot more details in modern cards that makes it difficult to fake. The Liliana looked fake to me straight away (even though it was in a sleeve) and even I could point out a few things wrong."

You need to move quantity of an item, and you need to do it in a way that doesn't get you in trouble. Why try and sell one fake mox (which will be heavily scrutinized) when you can sell 500 thoughtsieze without anyone even batting an eye.  If you are so skilled at print replication that your fake magic cards pass heavy scrutiny you are in the wrong field. the goal of the counterfeiter is to make something that passes a quick glance. It's a waste of time and money to do anything else."

I picked up a nice looking SP Sneak Attack for $35 shipped on there a few months back for my EDH deck. Just be sure to keep an eye out for any cards that appear to be in unnaturally good condition considering the current printings of fakes - also always check a buyer's rep beforehand, and when receiving the card, have someone more experienced in Magic (ex: a LGS owner/worker) take a good look at it."

mtgmarketwatch,32oxhx,Rock-swarm,1 point,Wed Apr 15 17:27:57 2015 UTC,"i saw modern masters, looked at the MSRP $6.99 and thought it was going to slide back down to 3.99-4.99 since modern was only a ~2 year old format at that point and LGS stores ALWAYS discounted MSRP after a month or so....yeah...they were selling for almost double MSRP right out of the gate.  i saw modern masters as more of a legacy playables being reprinted in a junky draft format....so i decided not to buy  i fucked myself hard on that decision.   my theory for modern masters is what conspiracy actually turned out to be, i saw conspiracy saw foil brainstorms, foil stifles, bulk rares being staples in legacy burl like sulfric vortex and told myself hey....last time i passed on a ""stupid draft format"" that had legacy playables i missed out....so now im sitting on 4 conspiracy boxes in the closet....  so i am 0/2 so far  which is why i am struggling with modern masters 2015. i don't know....i really don't....when modern masters came out nobody played the newest format wotc came out with (introduced in 2011); the playerbase for modern is HUGE today, PPTQ's in modern firing left and right. in 2013 all we played here in socal was standard. now my small town has 2 stores that fire modern events 2 times a week.   more people pre-registered for GP vegas alone this year than people who had attended GP vegas when modern masters was the format in 2013.   so idk if it's facing the ""walmart problem"" too big to grow, anyone interested in modern at this point most likely has a deck at least picked out/half built."
mtgmarketwatch,32oxhx,Lollipopsaurus,1 point,Thu Apr 16 01:25:28 2015 UTC,"Conspiracy's biggest downfall was the draft-only cards. Just like the ""Un"" sets before it, a significant portion of the community abhors cards that truly have no value outside of a specific format, and I'm using the loosest definition of value possible. I would not be surprised to see next year's summer offering to either be another Modern Masters product, or a commander/Tiny Leaders product."
mtgmarketwatch,32oxhx,150crawfish,1 point,Thu Apr 16 04:11:55 2015 UTC,"I think the GP signups are an indicator of how popular this will actually be.  People are excited to draft this set.  I'm just saying that in the short term, there will be a shortage of product until the distributors figure out how much product actually exists, and can allocate it properly.  There will be room to profit initially by flipping boxes.  Worst case scenario, if there's too much product and the prices of every staple drop to nothing, Wizards will be very reluctant to print something like this at such a large scale again, and we'll see the Modern Masters 2013 fiasco over and over, and the average player will draft these maybe once or twice, then have to buy singles.  I personally have faith that Wizards knows what they're doing, and won't overprint staples like that."

I still have 7 packs left.  MM2015's pre-order price is a lot higher and a much risker prospect, so there's less money to be made.  I wouldn't buy in this time, because it's harder to tell if it's worth it.  If you still want to buy something to spec on, buy staples that won't be reprinted from MM2015."
mtgmarketwatch,32oxhx,katsudon-jpz,1 point,Thu Apr 16 14:03:03 2015 UTC,150 was below MSRP for MMA i believe. I think MSRP was $167. I ordered a box online after spoilers for I believe $220. Sub-$200 never happened after spoilers were released.

mtgmarketwatch,32nykd,Rock-swarm,2,Wed Apr 15 08:48:55 2015 UTC,Thanks. That helps me getting more insight!
mtgmarketwatch,32nykd,Bigbadbear888,1 point,Wed Apr 15 08:50:13 2015 UTC,For KTK the set was highest the day after the Pro Tour top 8
mtgmarketwatch,32nykd,parenthetical___,1 point,Wed Apr 15 19:03:40 2015 UTC,What is an example of tech? Is it basically card combos? Is there a list out there?
mtgmarketwatch,32nykd,SaffronOlive,6,Fri Apr 24 09:50:40 2015 UTC,"I agree with what everyone is saying. Typically, the days of (and right after) the Pro Tour following a set release is typically the peak of the total set price.   You are correct about the impact of GP's and PT's on prices, although generally the PT's have a much larger and more immediate effect.   Standard prices are notoriously fickle. For instance, Mastery of the Unseen was viewed as a SB card for control matchups when it was printed, and as a result was close to a bulk rare. Then GW Devotion came along, looked good on camera, won an SCG Open, and the price spiked. Now, a month later, GW Devotion sucks (judging by the PT data), so the price has decreased. So whatever deck/decks are the flavor of the month increase in prices, and when they fall out of favor, these prices decrease.   The other big one is supply. All sets naturally decrease in price as boxes are opened and sets are redeemed from Magic Online.   As for MM2, the most likely outcome is mythics decrease a bit before (potentially) rebounding (based on how much of the set is actually released), rares decrease significantly and tournament staple rares (potentially) rebound in the coming years (assuming they are not reprinted again), and uncommons/commons crash."
mtgmarketwatch,32nykd,stitches_extra,1 point,Wed Apr 15 12:15:40 2015 UTC,"Now, a month later, GW Devotion sucks (judging by the PT data), so the price has decreased.    the price started dropping before the PT. I think this has to do with more and more FRf being opened, and so supply increasing."
mtgmarketwatch,32nykd,apaniyam,6,Wed Apr 15 19:41:40 2015 UTC,So we are in the window of highest prices. This all changes dramatically when redemption hits and the price of a full set crashes.
mtgmarketwatch,32nykd,arramdaywalker,1 point,Wed Apr 15 11:16:59 2015 UTC,When does redemption begin? When does it end?
mtgmarketwatch,32nykd,Manadyne,3,Thu Apr 16 16:01:47 2015 UTC,"Prices on new sets are high in the week between prerelease and actual release due to hype and limited supplies.  The week between Pro Tour and Game Day is also a very high point and an excellent time to sell/trade. Bad showings, poor performances on the Pro Tour, new stuff bringing other archetypes up to Tier 1. With the original Modern Masters, we saw the price on all the commons and uncommons printed to tank.  Staple rares lost up to 50% of their value and have been climbing back up since.  Non-staple rares have remained at depressed prices.  For mythics, there was a temporary reduction in price before the climb started again.  For Emrakul and Karn, I expect them to drop down to the $20-25 range and climb very slowly from there."
mtgmarketwatch,32nykd,MortalSword_MTG,1 point,Wed Apr 15 11:24:59 2015 UTC,"Many of the MM C/U tanked but rebounded to some degree, which is likely to occur with any  C/U reprints in MM2 that did not appear in the last MM. Anything that gets reprinted from MM in MM2 at C/U will lose a lot of value and likely stay there."

mtgmarketwatch,32m3hk,MrForgetful,9,Tue Apr 14 21:54:06 2015 UTC,From Edmonton by any chance?   Edit : I'm going to assume you are because this can't be a coincidence.  I was the other guy you were bidding against.  😊   S Chinese is not very well liked but there is still people interested.  I'd try the high end Facebook group and see what you could get from there for bites.  Cracking the box is risky if you don't play modern or commander as there is some great cards in there.  If you open a couple of sensei tops your doing very well.  Hopefully your foil pulls are decent and you can get ahead on it.  At your price range I'd try to flip it.  That's my opinion and the thoughts I had go through my mind as I continued bidding against you.   Small world after all.
mtgmarketwatch,32m3hk,X87x,5,Wed Apr 15 06:02:17 2015 UTC,"Hahaha small world man, made me pay an extra $40, why couldn't you stay out when you were out =P Thanks for the feedback cheers!"
mtgmarketwatch,32m3hk,X87x,2,Wed Apr 15 16:13:06 2015 UTC,"I still think you got a pretty good deal on the box. If you don't mind playing with foreign cards, I'd definitely be considering on cracking the box. Otherwise I still think your in line to make some money with flipping it. If you do open it, make sure you post your pulls on /r/Magiccardpulls ."
mtgmarketwatch,32m3hk,Lollipopsaurus,3,Wed Apr 15 16:31:57 2015 UTC,"Champions of Kamigawa was actually a decent draft set.  Opening this box won't get you what you paid for it, so the value you'll get from opening it is drafting with friends.  You can always look up the cards to see what they do.  Between Sensei's Divining Top, Ghostly Prison, and Hinder, you have a decent number of commander staples at uncommon, so I'm sure you could get some friends to pay $19 for a draft."

mtgmarketwatch,32jexk,jimini-christmas,1 point,Tue Apr 14 21:29:03 2015 UTC,i don't think this changes the fact that respected players succeeding with obscure cards on a widely distributed media outlet has an impact on the demand for s given card. Joke or not.
mtgmarketwatch,32jexk,Unknown_Phate,2,Tue Apr 14 23:07:57 2015 UTC,"Im less sure.  Small supply cards and short term spikes reflect the pro streamers.  Isn't that what the community does?  Let the pro's figure out the meta, then we all build around it?  If an obscure rare were to put up results then you would expect a jump.  [[Night of Souls Betrayal]] is a good example.  Its not super amazing because its an expensive card mana-wise and it is really only good against twin or delver, yet it spiked because someone pro used it in a junk midrange deck in modern to hate on twin"
mtgmarketwatch,32jexk,Little_Gray,2,Wed Apr 15 05:16:39 2015 UTC,It was mentioned a few weeks ago that if it was even bought out it would stay at a higher price so its not surprising that somebody went and did a buyout.    Its an old card that really has not seen a price increase in six or seven years and is used in a couple vintage/legacy decks so there is a good chance the price will stick.
mtgmarketwatch,32jexk,worldchrisis,1 point,Wed Apr 15 07:27:47 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, I've got no problem with $10 was just curious if it started seeing more play or got talked about/camera time somewhere rather than someone relizing they can afford all the copies on tcgplayer"
mtgmarketwatch,32jexk,Little_Gray,1 point,Tue Apr 14 13:50:08 2015 UTC,Seems like a price correction.
mtgmarketwatch,32jexk,worldchrisis,4,Tue Apr 14 14:15:16 2015 UTC,"Its not a price correction, its a buyout.  Its a vintage staple though which is why people wont really care all that much about the new price."
mtgmarketwatch,32jexk,nathanmasse,1 point,Tue Apr 14 14:47:38 2015 UTC,It's a card that's been underpriced for a while based on the play it sees and the availability.
mtgmarketwatch,32jexk,worldchrisis,4,Tue Apr 14 16:16:56 2015 UTC,Being played =/= should be pricey.  The issue with the 'it sees legacy play and so should be worth something' is that very few people are buying into legacy so there isn't a competitive market.  Those entering legacy are generally trying to do it cheaply with Burn or something.    Very low demand has kept the price low; now very low supply will keep the price up.
mtgmarketwatch,32jexk,Little_Gray,1 point,Tue Apr 14 18:10:00 2015 UTC,The issue with the 'it sees legacy play and so should be worth something' is that very few people are buying into legacy so there isn't a competitive market.

mtgmarketwatch,32jexk,nathanmasse,1 point,Tue Apr 14 19:01:13 2015 UTC,Everything he said except for the competitive market part was correct. Legacy is growing but at an extremely slow rate and when new people get into legacy they generally do so with cheap decks.
mtgmarketwatch,32jexk,Lollipopsaurus,1 point,Tue Apr 14 19:04:03 2015 UTC,Perhaps I misspoke when I said there isn't a competitive market.  My thinking was that there is a much more restricted supply and demand compared to Modern or Standard so prolonged undercutting is uncommon (with exception of mass reprints like Stifle).  And this card in particular (which only really sees competitive play in vintage) has an enormous barrier to entry in the form of Moxes and a set of Mishra's Workshops which actually make the deck function.
mtgmarketwatch,32hs5e,platypussdown,10,Mon Apr 13 22:20:16 2015 UTC,"If you're getting it for play I say go for it. The price is probably going to be relatively stable for the next year with a slow upward trend, I can't see wizards printing banned cards in MMA2 so you should be fine."

mtgmarketwatch,32ften,SirPsychoMantis,0,Mon Apr 13 17:23:53 2015 UTC,"You will have to wait it out, usually until after they stop handing those packs out as prizes.  Or even longer when redemption stops for Khans.  The price for Theros (correct me if I am wrong) is probably due to saturation as those were being handed out before people were widely giving up on MTGO due to the issues (less people/packs now than before).  It could also be that people aren't drafting it as much as Khans as well as it doesn't have many future staples (Modern, Legacy, Commander, etc..).  Really long term value is there if you have the patience for that (3+ years), just look at some of the other older MTGO packs that have good value cards in them and that were a blast to draft."

mtgmarketwatch,32290m,nylarotep,-4,Sun Apr 12 19:40:54 2015 UTC,collected company is an absolutely amazing spec IMO.  It being under $10 is ludicrous.  I think people focus too much on the mana efficiency and not the card advantage when it comes to evaluating it.
mtgmarketwatch,32290m,EsportsLottery,12,Fri Apr 10 02:13:09 2015 UTC,I dont think you understand what is required for a standard rare to go above $10.  Thinking collected company could ever hit $10 is what is ludicrous.

mtgmarketwatch,32290m,Chisinf,7,Mon Apr 13 01:01:53 2015 UTC,"I'm skeptical. It's a 4-drop, and even if it's the only non-creature spell in your deck AND you limit yourself to all creatures <= 3CMC, you'll whiff on at the very least the second creature every now and then.    See the Unwritten is less expensive, a mythic (though in a more opened set) in the same format, digs through more cards, AND it doesn't limit the casting cost of the creatures in your deck to be effective. Obviously it has a tough limitation in that you can only get two creatures if you hit Ferocious, but the upside in that case is way higher.    That it's ""ludicrous"" that Collected Company is under $10 as a rare seems far fetched. It's nowhere near that oppressive. I'm not saying it won't climb a few more dollars, but if you buy in at this point, I'm skeptical you'll make any money.    Edit: I know it's seen some Modern play, but even Birthing Pod barely stayed at $10, even though it certainly spiked quite a bit more."

It doesn't need a reprint anymore than any other card does, but it does cost more than, say, [[Damnation]] does at the moment. That said, I wouldn't expect a reprint in MM2015 if they want to keep the Swords at mythic rarity. There's only so much space in those 15 cards, and two of them in MM2013 were taken up by the Swords. I'd think they don't want too much duplication between the two, especially at mythic rarity."
mtgmarketwatch,31ytvt,Drilnoth,3,Thu Apr 9 06:00:20 2015 UTC,"And as each new iteration of MM is released, it's just that many more cards jockeying for those precious mythic rare slots."

mtgmarketwatch,31xeta,SaffronOlive,2,Wed Apr 8 23:41:51 2015 UTC,you are going to have to explain why city of brass is worse
mtgmarketwatch,31xeta,devin93uk,10,Thu Apr 9 01:00:19 2015 UTC,Because effects that tap lands like [Rishadan Port] still cause pain for players using city of brass but not mana confluence.

mtgmarketwatch,31xeta,humanoid_typhoon,5,Thu Apr 9 01:31:04 2015 UTC,"When you force city of brass to tap, even if you dont make mana with it, you have to pay 1 life. Mana confluence does not"
mtgmarketwatch,31xeta,pinkpopo,5,Thu Apr 9 01:05:18 2015 UTC,"Conversely since city of brass damage is a trigger and not a cost, there is an edge case where you're at 1 life and can instant speed combo off with the damage trigger on the stack where you wouldn't have enough mana with mana confluence.   But that edge case is probably much less common than the port and urborg cases. And including edh, lantern and omen are suddenly reasonably common situations."

mtgmarketwatch,31nq9q,pengox80,7,Mon Apr 6 19:03:22 2015 UTC,"modern staples have seen one downswing not precipitated by reprints, and that was post GP Richmond. For whatever reason, that event was some type of fever pitch for modern, and after it things cooled down some. Tarn and Misty drifted down from their highs etc. even before the announcement of Khans fetches.  Baring that, modern staples go up until they get reprinted. So while Lili, Snap, etc. could spike or see their upward movement accelerate because of the modern PPTQ season, holding them will probably still be the better idea. Until their imminent reprint, which at this point may be Modern Masters 2017 (unless they annualize that product), or a return to X. Given we're getting return to Zendikar in 2015, following a return to ravnica in 2013, its likely 2016 won't see a return to X plane set. Even if it does, it is much more likely to be one of the outstanding storylines, which are Phyrexians/Mirrodin, Nicol Bolas, and Eldrazi (Battle for Zendikar), also there is a long overdue return to Dominaria.  TL:DR INN/RTR stuff is probably a good hold until at least end of 2016 in terms of reprints tanking value."
mtgmarketwatch,31nq9q,jassi007,3,Mon Apr 6 19:27:39 2015 UTC,"This makes sense to a degree, but there is also a lot of risk in holding on to a staple for an entire year, hoping that a reprint doesn't come in Origins or promo form.   I think Griselbrand as the GP promo, Liliana of the Veil as a PTQ promo and the Geist of St Traft WMC promo signals the fact that Snapcaster could be reprinted as a promo soon. Of course that's pure speculation, but I wouldn't be surprised if WotC were to make it available to competitive players since all these Innistrad staples were released solely as competitive promos in the past year."
mtgmarketwatch,31nq9q,jassi007,3,Tue Apr 7 00:41:52 2015 UTC,"Ok. Now aside from GP promo's which are a thing, go show that PTQ/WMC promo's have ever existed in quantities sufficient enough to move the prices of the cards. Hint: they don't. The LOTV and Geist promo's aren't affecting the price of the regular or pack foils.  They could just print whatever in any set, but I'd be willing to bet on investing in a spare playset of snapcasters that it doesn't see a reprint in the next 12 months. Liliana's ""reprint"" is a chase rare, it won't do anything to the price of the card. It may dent the price of pack foils a bit, but not likely. There aren't going to be enough regional PTQ's to put more than a tiny amount more in circulation."
mtgmarketwatch,31nq9q,Snow_Regalia,2,Tue Apr 7 01:22:54 2015 UTC,Not to mention the new Thalia for this year's WMC. Anyone know when the new GP promo will be announced?

mtgmarketwatch,31kmtl,iamqba,11,Wed Apr 8 03:51:51 2015 UTC,"So you think that someone who pulls a goyf will think ""better get three more!"" rather than ""I can sell this for $100!"" when before opening the pack they wanted to buy 0 goyfs?    This is a groundbreaking criticism of most rationalist economics."
mtgmarketwatch,31kmtl,xxpashuxx,14,Mon Apr 6 00:41:19 2015 UTC,"The thing with a trading card game is that it isn't just simple economics. Consider that mm2 is designed for semi experienced players (a new player wouldn't by a $10 pack next to a $4 one for cards that aren't even standard legal). Now that means the consumer will likely be thinking about getting into modern eventually if they haven't already. So to them, the goyf is not a ""I can sell this for $100"" but rather a ""now I only need to spend $300 instead of $400"" and for some people, that's enough to let them pull the trigger and they go and buy the other 3."

mtgmarketwatch,31kmtl,KumaBear2803,2,Mon Apr 6 01:19:10 2015 UTC,"Not at all. People crack packs for different reasons. If you're drafting Modern Masters, chances are you're interested in chase mythics like Goyf and Karn. Some players might sell it right away, but a good number will be trying to complete their playsets. The price will depend on how many players are doing the former as opposed to the latter.   That's what I was trying to imply."

mtgmarketwatch,31kmtl,potato1,2,Mon Apr 6 15:04:28 2015 UTC,"Then you're ignoring the marginal costs and rewards associated with this situation.

Liliana is going to be out of the reach of a fair few players for at least the next two years until the next modern Masters reprint.   It just seems that modern just isn't targeted for youths without full time jobs.  A sad reality is that modern will set you back heaps. This is not a cause for huge amount of concern though, because as I see it,  u have two options:   save every cent u can in the hope of picking up lili. The price may or may not dip in the 2 year term depending on reprints.  Yes she will likely get more expensive in a year -probably 120 depending on the demand generated from MM15. so u will be down 90 ish than if u bought now;  or play for the long term and use are much money as u can to get other modern staples.  Fetches shocks- complete your collection. Abrupt decay, rest in peace, stony silence. All the uncommons from MM15.  These are unlikely to be reprinted for at least a few years, and have cross deck appeal. Your Money will increase.  Yes u won't have 3 lili, but u week have everything else.   Basically question your Assumptions- do you actually need 4 lili? will u be playing lili in every modern deck you play over the next few years? Is this the best way to spend ur money?   The more questions u ask, the more u can be sure u are making the perfect decision with the information u have now  EDIT: I am on topic and contributing to the conversation by suggesting alternate courses of action to the OP.

mtgmarketwatch,31bdsn,MassdropBot,4,Fri Apr 3 15:11:00 2015 UTC,Would it be better to buy 8-10 Fetch Lands?
mtgmarketwatch,31bdsn,13x13-100,4,Fri Apr 3 21:09:24 2015 UTC,Take a look at this recent article I posted over at /r/mtgfinance. It's a breakdown of fetchland investments over the rest of the year.
mtgmarketwatch,31bdsn,goldenCapitalist,3,Sat Apr 4 03:21:14 2015 UTC,"Why do you feel sealed KtK boxes are not a good investment?  I personally feel they are a great investment and here is why: -Fetch lands are played in every format in magic that they are legal.  They are used, typically, more than a type of dual land (real duals or shocks) as they can fix you from many angles with a single land. -KtK by itself was an amazing draft and sealed format.  SO many archetypes to play with enough fixing to splash and play almost anything. -There are a lot of good/great legends for Commander/Tiny Leaders. -Compare this to ZEN boxes and just see the oozing potential here.  KtK is a better draft format I feel, over ZEN.  Although ZEN had original never printed fetches where as KtK Fetches are reprints. -This is the last 3 set block we are likely to see for a very long time. -FOILS FOILS FOILS.  Fetch lands have a great foil multiplier and the Legendary creatures (Commander Generals) will eventually have a similar one. -Any sealed product from a well liked set has ALWAYS gone up, even if just a little.  For $85, there is no real downside.  Some potential bad things to consider: -Reprinted fetch lands will probably never get back to the values we saw with the more scarce ONS fetches. -There was a TON of these boxes printed.  More than any other set previously. -Now that Wizards has bit the bullet (and lowered the value of ONS fetches), what is to stop them from jamming these fetches into other sealed products like special sets, duel decks, commander sets, etc.  I have just outlined a few reasons (good and bad) why this make a solid investment.  I feel the Good heavily outweighs the Bad, not necessarily on the number of points I have outlined but the substance of all the points for each side made as a whole.  Edit:  Just bought 4 boxes myself.  I already have 8 more in a safe in storage."
mtgmarketwatch,31bdsn,AdamRA4,1 point,Fri Apr 3 16:52:24 2015 UTC,"I agree. KtK is the bet draft format since Innistrad.   While KtK doesn't have the Liliana/Geist or Snapcaster value cards, it will still rise because of fetches alone.  My opinion is that fetches will stay low for a while though, like RtR shocks. You can get most of them still under $10. While they see 0 Legacy play, I don't think that the KtK fetches will jump for a long time.  Regardless KtK was a smash hit, and great draft format and has fetches. These factors make sealed product a great investment. I'll probably pickup a few of these too."
mtgmarketwatch,31bdsn,jball_2k,1 point,Fri Apr 3 17:27:46 2015 UTC,"Was KTK's draft format that much better than RTR's? I'm possibly just nostalgic since it's been a while, but I think I had more fun drafting RTR than KTK. But you're correct that 3x KTK is still a damn fine format. Definitely second behind RTR if it's not the first."
mtgmarketwatch,31bdsn,Sand_Coffin,2,Fri Apr 3 18:09:15 2015 UTC,"Both were slow formats, but KTK was slow because so many people played 3-5 color goodstuff. RTR was slow because there were a bunch of token producers and 2/4s that gummed up the board. I liked KTK limited a lot more than RTR limited."
mtgmarketwatch,31bdsn,worldchrisis,1 point,Fri Apr 3 21:05:48 2015 UTC,Do you guys think wizards is done printing innovative mana options?
mtgmarketwatch,31bdsn,ardeay,1 point,Sat Apr 4 07:44:44 2015 UTC,"I also wonder what WotC's new ""aggressive reprint"" strategy will be. Fetches might not be the investment people are assuming (though I still think they are likely to be just fine.)"
mtgmarketwatch,31bdsn,idontknowhowreddit,2,Fri Apr 3 19:36:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm not sure either. We're in kind of new territory with all these reprints happening.  I don't see Legacy really growing right now compared to Modern. Modern seems to be getting a lot more people invested. Seeing shocks not really rising is strange to me.  Maybe there are just so many out there, which is probably the case. With RtR block, even Drain's Maze having the occasional shock land in a booster.   Seeing the most popular around $13 and most being under $10 seems odd to me. This makes me think that we're not going to see an increase in the KtK fetches for quite some time. Really long term they're probably fine."
mtgmarketwatch,31bdsn,jball_2k,3,Fri Apr 3 20:20:03 2015 UTC,"When shocks rotated, the demand went from (standard + modern + edh) to (modern + edh). Standard is obviously the biggest force for prices as standard is at least 2-10x bigger than the rest of the formats. However, after rotations, prices seemed to stay the same due to ""eternal demand"". What really happened was speculators bought in at rotation waiting for them to shoot up. This kept the price from taking a significant dip at rotation.  Now shocks are being held in large quantities by hundreds of people. And they are watching their investment stagnate. I know of many people crossing their fingers and praying that MM2 causes a substantial influx of new players to break a profit on their shocks. I'll be aiming to sell my last few that I am not using before those large power sellers attempt to liquidate.  How does this apply to Fetchlands? Well you said it yourself that Legacy is really not growing at all. Without fetchland demand from NEW legacy players, the situation between fetchlands and shocklands, I predict, will look very similar. Keeping in mind the possibility for reprints and a non-zero possibility of them coming as soon as Battle for Zendikar make the fetchlands far from a stellar investment."
mtgmarketwatch,31bdsn,jball_2k,2,Fri Apr 3 20:39:42 2015 UTC,"Well said, I agree 100%."
mtgmarketwatch,31bdsn,worldchrisis,3,Fri Apr 3 20:41:50 2015 UTC,"The difference in the number of copies of rares nowadays compared to Ravnica block and even moreso Onslaught block is huge.   Also Modern decks just don't actually play that many shocks. People looked at the RTR Standard decks that played 12 shocks and 12 M10 checklands and just extrapolated that to Modern replacing the checks with fetches. That's not how it works.   A 2 color Modern deck will play 3-4 shocks. A 3 color Modern deck will play 4-5. You don't need playsets of all of them to play Modern, but you did for Standard, and a lot of Standard players held onto those shocks."
mtgmarketwatch,31bdsn,Little_Gray,2,Fri Apr 3 21:13:09 2015 UTC,"I think people just dont understand why we say to invest in fetches.  Its not about the price increase its that they are pretty much at their bottom and are a ""safe"" investment."
mtgmarketwatch,31bdsn,idontknowhowreddit,1 point,Sat Apr 4 14:01:10 2015 UTC,"There are quite a few people on the sub who point out what the price of onslaught fetches were and then say that KTK fetches will get close to that.   You may intend to say one thing, but there are quite a few people who think fetches are gonna make them rich."
mtgmarketwatch,31bdsn,Little_Gray,1 point,Sat Apr 4 17:45:34 2015 UTC,Those people are forgetting that it took onslaught fetches 10 years and a massive legacy spike to get there.
mtgmarketwatch,31bdsn,idontknowhowreddit,1 point,Mon Apr 6 12:55:29 2015 UTC,"Forgetting, or they never knew.  I at one time was one of those people who opened one and was like ""why do I want to pay 1 life just to get a land, that doesn't seem good"" until I learned why. New players ask ""My friend used a flooded strand to get a steam vents. That's against the rules right?"" and then learn that it's not and that is why it's so good (again, these people don't get paying hundreds of dollars for real duals either yet.)  So there are a lot of newer players, and a lot of talk about how fetches aren't going to be cheaper any time soon (that we can foresee) and I have seen people who seem to think they are going to be Scrooge McDucking in it all soon enough.   I think it needs to be pointed out that Fetches are like, pretty secure stocks. Sure, they CAN crash if things change, but they are likely a safe investment.  Random situation cards that could suddenly have a broken interaction are the penny stocks. You could hit big, or just blew all your cash on bulk cards.  Duals and power are your mutual funds. They might not grow fast, but they will keep climbing unless everything comes crashing down in which case pretty much nothing was safe."
mtgmarketwatch,31bdsn,Encendi,1 point,Mon Apr 6 21:04:46 2015 UTC,My opinion is that foreign (i.e. Korean/Russian) KTK boxes are probably better than English ones because current values are heavily depressed and the print run is so large. However someone is going to be frothing at the mouth for a chance to pull a $1400 foil Polluted Delta.
mtgmarketwatch,31bdsn,goldenCapitalist,1 point,Sat Apr 4 01:58:48 2015 UTC,"I would like to point out that KTK boxes are currently available on Ebay for about the same price. The next highest listing goes for just a couple bucks more.   So while I'm not doubting that this isn't a good opportunity, if you're in no rush to buy a box, you can hold off and still pick them up for more or less the same price elsewhere later on. For now, I'm saving my money for MM2015 boxes."
mtgmarketwatch,31cc3f,NikolaiGogol,4,Fri Apr 3 19:18:26 2015 UTC,This has been happening on and off for the past three weeks.  Each of the modern-bordered Tron lands has spiked and then fallen back to a normal price level.  It's just a buyout.

mtgmarketwatch,31b8o3,gamblekat,2,Mon Apr 6 06:41:06 2015 UTC,"This is likely the ideal time to trade out of this card, unless you want the value of playing it in tourneys.  EDIT - Also note, the extremely small foil multiplier. While the non-foil price is likely at it's all-time high, the foil price is likely at it's all-time low. I've never been a huge fan of standard-only foils, but at the very least Thunderbreak regent is going to be a prime example of standard-only rare price trajectory for the new rotation schedule."
mtgmarketwatch,31b8o3,Rock-swarm,1 point,Wed Apr 8 00:51:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there was a similar situation with Tasigur immediately after FRF. If he can't sustain $10, I can't see Thunderbreak doing it considering it's a Game Day promo and in the event deck."
mtgmarketwatch,31b8o3,gamblekat,1 point,Wed Apr 8 01:33:38 2015 UTC,Yea regular Thunderbreak is going to crash hard even if it sees a ton of play.  If siege rhino and Tasigur which see play in multiple formats cant sustain those numbers then no was is Thunderbreak.  The foils as well as game day promo are probably worth checking out though.

At which point your Moxes and Loti will simple become collectables for those who want them and those formats will either transition to non-paper or be the domain of those that have them/proxie events. There's really no reason to panic over legacy staples due to the format ""dying"".   If there's a real concern to be had it's the improving quality of those Chinese fakes that everyone knows about. Right now they're detectable, but considering with each batch we've seen improvement, however slight, they're improving. That's where the real threat to your portfolio comes from. If in two or three years you can pay 300 for a Legacy or Vintage deck that's as good as real and play the threat of those formats dying will actually go down. So the question really becomes: ""How long am I willing to hold these value card without some confirmation from Wizards they're keeping them safe"" because right now they've been nearly radio silent when it comes to these fakes. And that's my worry. Really there are few appealing options in the group when it comes to these fakes: 1. Wizards abolishes the reserved list and begins printing the wanted cards at a rate they control that allows prices to be maintained (thus acknowledging the secondary market) 2. They allow the fakes to continue being produced and accept it as a part of the game. (They aren't printing a vast majority of the cards and the ones they do will still sell sets when they come back. Zendikar fetches, Snaps and the like.) 3. They crack down hard and have to invest money into stopping the counter-fitters. (Likely not worth the money for them.)  Other options exist, but I see these three or something similar as the most likely. And two, potentially all of these are bad for your portfolio. So as far as your Vintage and Legacy staples go, as yourself how much of a risk you want to take. A lot, keep holding till your happy to dump them. Otherwise I'd put a solid two year cap to hold them unless we hear solid word from Wizards in any regard relation to Fakes and Reserved List.   That said, write them, email them, press them to action if you care. Their silence is disheartening.   Modern is okay. I'm almost sure that as long as the game lives we'll have formats like Modern and Standard. That said if Wizards decides to make Modern affordable with MM and more generous reprints then you may lose out. I'd almost wait a few sets into the New Block Paradigm to decide where to put your holdings. If we go a few blocks with nothing crazy then great, start going deep. But if we run into Snapcaster Mage on Zendikar, you may need to reassess how you invest.   I've honestly grown to believe that Standard is going to be the best format to invest in. 2nd sets will Hinge two whole rotations and that'll make great opportunity for value.   As for the game fading down, I feel it's worthless to speculate one it. They've shown us rising numbers every year and it seems Magic and Wizards are in a good place. If it starts to fade you should be able to see it happening. A bad set or two. Local attendance down. Ect, ect. My key advice here is, don't hold more than you need to and only hold what you believe in most. No matter how long you hold it Charcoal Diamond will probably never be Mox Jet.   That all said, don't worry man, be happy. Magics going great and everything will be fine. There's no need for us all to go ""HARD TIMES CALL FOR HARD MEN! TIME TO MAKE HARD DECISIONS."""
mtgmarketwatch,31dmi4,insertcleverid,2,Sat Apr 4 20:50:11 2015 UTC,Legacy is dying?

mtgmarketwatch,31dmi4,EjayG,2,Sat Apr 4 05:05:46 2015 UTC,"I don't remember how unpopular magic was in 2004, because in 2004 I was a senior in high school and one of the founders of our Magic club 3 years prior to that, and 3 days a week we packed 40+ kids into a classroom for a lunch period of playing, trading, and deck building. Magic was very popular for us at that period, and I'm pretty sure our hobby as we all got jobs and kept playing kept at least one of our local card shops alive from 2007-current."

Get involved with your local ASB, let them know that you want to be recognized as a club for incoming freshmen introduction classes, work to grow your club. It will probably surprise you how quickly it grows if you provide an atmosphere where people are free to just play the game. High school blows, and the social stigmas associated with playing a game like magic doesn't make it any better, so if you provide somewhere that all of that is removed, people will want to go and play, and new people will want to learn how to play. It took us years to grow it, and some of us still go back to our old school and drop off boxes of unused cards for the kids to play with and take for themselves. It sounds strange now, but build something like that and you'll be able to look back on it, even if you never play again, and you'll know you did something that mattered to someone."

mtgmarketwatch,31dmi4,kampfschafe,2,Sat Apr 4 03:32:38 2015 UTC,"Magic has never truly been a ""children's card game"", it features many childish players but the demographic has never matched that of PokeMon or Yu-Gi-Oh for number of actual children playing. However, 2004 was the tail end of Mirrodin block and the start of Champions of Kamigawa. Fifth Dawn was lackluster and Standard revolved around Ravager Affinity. The entirety of Kamigawa block pretty much sucked, which coupled with the dominance of Affinity, caused a downturn in player-base.  From personal experience as a player, my local store didn't run Standard format, just booster draft and Vintage. Both of them quite popular and averaging 16 for drafts every Friday and 30+ on Sundays for Vintage. The Standard format Arena leagues were lightly attended with 8-10 being the norm. The real drop-off was in  early 2005 when Betrayers of Kamigawa failed to improve on the block and proved lackluster for draft. Didn't pick up again until Ravnica: City of Guilds was released.  With the addition of a 3rd Eternal format (Modern) and the surge in popularity for EDH/Commander and Tiny Leaders, I doubt we'll see the price drops that happened back then. If anything the market may stagnate some for easier to obtain staples, but the demand for Legacy goodness to round out portfolios will just increase because people will drop the more niche items for better long-term investments (fetches, shocks, duals)."

Dual lands are never to be considered ""liquid"", they're long-term investments right along with the moxen and Black Lotus. They're bonds, you let them mature. The basis of any investment portfolio is solid investments, things that will simply never drop below the initial purchase price. Duals are, if I recall correctly, on the Reserved list. This means that they can safely form the nexus of a portfolio. Should the rest of your more liquid assets tank or a spec fail spectacularly, you still have the core investments to fall back on to rebuild with. The absolute worst thing you can ever do when maintaining a portfolio is to get too liquid.  For example, an unlimited mox sapphire in NM condition purchased in 2008 for $250 is now 3-4 times that in value roughly and could easily be flipped to a dealer for at least twice the initial investment. In 2024? As long as Magic is still being played, there will be people hunting for duals. With the pretty much non-existence of Vintage as a format, people are still forking over serious cash for P9 because they are the crown jewels. Quality condition dual lands that are used in every EDH deck that runs more than a single color?  FY2014 is in the bag, so Q2 is well over with. I read the Q4 and Full Year report to notice that despite foreign market troubles (that just about every company experienced in 2014), they posted a net gain in both Q4 and 2014 with a 20% gain in emerging markets. The Games division posted a loss of 4% because some lines (Kaijudo, Angry Birds, and Twister are named in the report) declined. Do not base the performance of one brand of a subsidiary on the overall performance of it's parent company, especially one as diverse as Hasbro."

mtgmarketwatch,3188ou,anubis647,2,Thu Apr 2 21:47:02 2015 UTC,"Well, by running this as the commander, it keeps you in G/B, which will make the deck a bit ""easier""/cheaper to build as you don't have access to the white cards (and, don't need to have more duals to have access to white mana).   And, it was cheaper than Doran, but definitely not now (well, the difference isn't as much as it was).   Also, as an aside... there is a big difference between Doran and Assault Formation. Doran makes all creatures deal damage based on toughness. Assault Formation is just your creatures.  Not exactly the same thing."

Regardless of other factors, legal or otherwise, they really can't just nix the reserved list and print paper Vintage Masters or whatever, even if they wanted to, since bowing to these counterfeits would be a horrible move for company image. Kind of like negotiating with terrorists on a smaller scale.   Either way, I don't envy whomever is dealing with this crap at WotC once they get word of this crap going on."

mtgmarketwatch,30xrr4,jestergoblin,1 point,Tue Mar 31 18:21:06 2015 UTC,"I can't quite say on Kozi or Emrakul, those double-digit mana cost numbers always looked a little off.  Metalcraft looks okay, but it might be trying to look at italics slanted.  And SoFaI and Jitte have off-looking equip costs.  If I saw these errors on pre-8th edition frames, I would probably pass them off as printing variances - but on modern cards it feels more noticeable."

The old fake Lilis and Karns were almost impossible to eyeball the difference between real and fake. If they ""improved"" upon all the fakes, namely the card stock quality, then it's going to get even harder to tell the difference."

mtgmarketwatch,30xrr4,Lollipopsaurus,1 point,Tue Mar 31 19:34:10 2015 UTC,"Very true. I recently traded for an Ashiok (when it was like $6) that looked great in poor lighting... but once the card spiked and I decided to just sell the ones I had because I weren't going to use them anyway, I found out it was creased. It so incredibly subtle and somehow didn't reach the edges, but it's warped because of it. :("
mtgmarketwatch,30xrr4,ardeay,1 point,Wed Apr 1 02:31:41 2015 UTC,"Font on colorless costs is much 'skinnier' than the real counterparts. The numbers are also off-center for numbers other than 1 or 0. Also some font type and kerning issues on flavor text for most of the cards.  With that said, I wouldn't be able to tell the difference between a real and fake flusterstorm or mox diamond without actively testing the card. I've heard of some versions passing the light test, although it would be infinitely more helpful to have a real version of the card for comparison."
mtgmarketwatch,30xzvo,QuiteIndifferent,1 point,Tue Mar 31 16:54:51 2015 UTC,Its an old card that pairs well with Trostani EDH decks.  nothing super special about it
mtgmarketwatch,30xzvo,Unknown_Phate,1 point,Tue Mar 31 17:06:12 2015 UTC,Well yes that's for sure.  What I'm wondering is if anyone has mentioned this in a speculation article or something.
mtgmarketwatch,30xzvo,Unknown_Phate,1 point,Tue Mar 31 17:46:19 2015 UTC,"Thats the thing.  ""Nothing special"".  Most of these cards aren't worth noting because they have little to no financial impact.  Low supply and low demand make for poor investments.  If the non-foils were disappearing too, I would be interested, but as it stands, I would only buy one if I needed it for a deck"
mtgmarketwatch,30wpp2,Chosler88,3,Tue Mar 31 09:21:16 2015 UTC,"It's surprising you thought something went wrong. If you're old enough to remember the days when the other un sets came out then you'd noticed the resemblance.  They were not popular back then and I see no reason for sets like this to be any different. Around 3 years after unhinged was released, I bought about 10 boxes for about $35-$40 each. People literally wanted to give them away and be done with it. The price didn't shoot up until the lands became popular with collectors and players. Conspiracy doesn't even have the lands to support it's future value. There are a few chase mythics but with wotc's current reprint policy, I can't see any value it in."
mtgmarketwatch,30wpp2,GosuMagic,4,Tue Mar 31 17:48:56 2015 UTC,"A big reason why I wanted to write this and update my former analysis (which was flawed) is because I wasn't around for those sets and had no idea about the price history of those.

mtgmarketwatch,30tcrl,guyincorporated,3,Mon Mar 30 19:42:02 2015 UTC,"I agree. I hate when people just arbitrarily slap on a ""great in cube"" label to shit cards to justify a foil price. This guy does diddly squat in powered/powerful cubes and peasant owners aren't going to pay huge dollars for a recent set foil. pure spec. tasigur is better by miles and this is the worse imitation of the worse imitation of tarmogoyf.   source: i'm a powered cube owner."
mtgmarketwatch,30tcrl,damonw,2,Tue Mar 31 07:45:23 2015 UTC,You dont support delve and graveyard shenanigans?
mtgmarketwatch,30tcrl,guyincorporated,3,Mon Mar 30 20:20:19 2015 UTC,Just because reanimator and delve both use the GY doesn't mean that they are terribly complimentary.  Reanimator isn't using forbidden alchemy or mulch and crossing its fingers.  They want to discard or entomb specific threats and then animate them.    Half the cubes out there don't even run tombstalker anymore.
mtgmarketwatch,30tcrl,mtd14,5,Mon Mar 30 21:34:53 2015 UTC,"It has spiked up to $6 a couple times before , and it has always settled right back down.   Why would I play this over Tasigur? Is the extra 1 power really worth the extra delve and loss of the ability? I doubt it."
mtgmarketwatch,30tcrl,Rock-swarm,9,Mon Mar 30 16:47:03 2015 UTC,"It's often played in conjunction with tasigur. Legendary is a thing, and the Angler has a relevant body when facing up against common threats like goyf, tasigur, rhino, etc."
mtgmarketwatch,30tcrl,mtd14,3,Mon Mar 30 17:32:09 2015 UTC,"Yup, its nice to have more than one on the board at one time. Many decks that want one of them want the other also. Lets not forget that Tasigur's ability is pretty mana and color intensive.  Also, not only is the fish he relevant against most other ground pounders, he is a great counter for Goyf specifically, because you can just eat all of his power from your graveyard."
mtgmarketwatch,30tcrl,Rock-swarm,2,Mon Mar 30 19:10:32 2015 UTC,"Often seems pretty generous. It shows up rarely with Tasigur in Legacy Delver, sometimes with a 1-1 split, sometimes with a 4-0 split towards Angler, but a one-of Angler seems more common. In modern, it occasionally shows up in Dredgevine lists but Dredgevine still isn't relevant to the meta let alone the Angler build.  http://www.mtggoldfish.com/price/Fate+Reforged/Gurmag+Angler#online"
mtgmarketwatch,30tcrl,stitches_extra,1 point,Mon Mar 30 22:40:35 2015 UTC,"I'm just explaining the source of the demand, and in the context of my earlier post, often is referencing the nature of the decks that use it, not it's overall presence across all formats."

mtgmarketwatch,30tcrl,TheRecovery,1 point,Mon Mar 30 20:10:50 2015 UTC,"In Modern, it's only showing up in some Dredgevine list ranging from not in the deck to a four of.

mtgmarketwatch,30shqh,MetalFearz,7,Mon Mar 30 09:39:08 2015 UTC,"I think sidisi will hit very big. At least from my experience, Sidisi is a nightmare to deal with. a 4/6 deathdouch and a tutor in one, all for 3BB. It's only a matter of time."
mtgmarketwatch,30shqh,tsxMTG,3,Mon Mar 30 10:16:41 2015 UTC,"I'd say they both have some ways to go. Dragonlord Ojutai is a very good card and once it finds the right deck it will be a staple going forward. Sidisi offers more for less with a less restrictive mana cost, but the fact that he's rare would probably keep the price lower than Ojutai going forward.  While the ""Exploit"" factor looked a little shoddy at first, in testing the card I've found its almost always relevant. I've even Exploited Siege Rhinos in a pinch against aggro decks just so that I could tutor up another Rhino to get the ETB trigger again."
mtgmarketwatch,30shqh,kahluahandcream,1 point,Mon Mar 30 16:11:05 2015 UTC,Ojutai is a very strong finisher that is finding it's deck. It plays well with ascendency and control decks.  It'll either settle down to 8-10 or jump up to 25 depending how the PT goes.
mtgmarketwatch,30shqh,rp_1,1 point,Mon Mar 30 18:48:19 2015 UTC,"Ojutai is mythic, Sidisi is rare."
mtgmarketwatch,30shqh,worldchrisis,0,Mon Mar 30 23:08:00 2015 UTC,"Ojutai will become a staple in some UW or UWx deck. The card is very similar to an Aetherling from last standard in the fact that it is a threat that can be dropped and pretty safe even if you tap out. It can really only be hit by Ugin, End Hostilities, Perilous Vault and Crux of Fate when in Hexproof mode. 5/4 for 5 in these colors with the two abilities makes the creature very efficient. Then as LSV said in his review of the card you don't need to swing, you can just swing when you have counter magic to save it from removal.   Ojutai also synergies well in esper based strategies since it can dodge mass removal with Crux so if the mana base improves I suspect it to get better.  The card will be a player in this standard and probably in the next rotation."
mtgmarketwatch,30tqfu,CigarPete,3,Mon Mar 30 17:13:33 2015 UTC,I heard core level allocation is 12 boxes from WotC.   Stores that use multiple vendors may be able to get more (since they'd be purchasing from multiple locations) and it's unclear at this point if shops will be able to order more (from WotC) after the initial release day order. Usually more is made available in some capacity until WotC runs out.  My suggestion: Go to GP Vegas and plan on attending Thursday and Friday side events if you want to open up a lot of MM2.
mtgmarketwatch,30tqfu,bmemike,1 point,Mon Mar 30 17:39:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I would love to go to GP Vegas, but getting wifely approval for two long weekends away during the year doesn't happen (we have two small boys, so time is at a premium), and I'm not about to give up GenCon for this.  I'll check with a few other local stores."
mtgmarketwatch,30tqfu,unusual2you,1 point,Mon Mar 30 18:02:58 2015 UTC,"As previously stated, stores had to select their distributor for MM2015 and will be getting whatever they can (based on store level with some leeway for the distributors) through that distributor. There hasn't been a second wave announced regardless of GP attendance."
mtgmarketwatch,30tqfu,gamblekat,1 point,Sat Apr 4 05:14:47 2015 UTC,"I believe it is going to be allocated in two waves, one before the GP weekend and one after. I suspect a large amount of the print run is being held to ensure that they don't run out for GP side events."
mtgmarketwatch,30tqfu,Little_Gray,1 point,Mon Mar 30 17:39:54 2015 UTC,That would just be the bare minimum he will be getting from Wizards.  The rest will come from his actual supplier so the number from that is up in the air.
mtgmarketwatch,30tqfu,unusual2you,1 point,Mon Mar 30 18:02:12 2015 UTC,"As all stores were required to sanction where they would be getting their MM2015 from via Wizards Event Reporter... We pretty much know how much we're getting and it's ""not enough"" by general consensus."
mtgmarketwatch,30tqfu,RudelyOutOfContext,1 point,Sat Apr 4 05:13:04 2015 UTC,"I asked my LGS (europe, advanced level) and he ordered 200 and is expecting to get 60-70% of that."
mtgmarketwatch,30tqfu,unusual2you,1 point,Mon Mar 30 23:24:03 2015 UTC,He can actually expect 5-9 cases (20 to 36) boxes total. The allocations were made public at the GAMA trade show and have only been tweaked slightly since the sanctioning window opened (and has since closed iirc). Advanced level stores can expect a minimum of 5 cases and there are 4 boxes to a case.
mtgmarketwatch,30tqfu,RudelyOutOfContext,1 point,Sat Apr 4 05:11:46 2015 UTC,He already sold 8 boxes to a guy from our FNM. So that would already be 1/3th of his stock.. Maybe I will go in today and reserve a box for myself. You can pre-order for MRSP.
mtgmarketwatch,30tqfu,James718,-1,Sat Apr 4 08:36:22 2015 UTC,Wizards could have really helped here by making it a non limited print run  The price gouging will be real

mtgmarketwatch,30tqfu,Berksmb,0,Tue Mar 31 22:13:06 2015 UTC,The purpose is to make money. It is in their interest it limit supply and therefore increase demand and the price they can sell boxes to distributors for.
mtgmarketwatch,30tqfu,AllFuckingNamesGone,0,Wed Apr 1 01:56:49 2015 UTC,"Doesn't the MSRP imply that there is a ceiling at what price they sell the product to distributors to?

mtgmarketwatch,30tqfu,Berksmb,1 point,Sat May 9 02:08:14 2015 UTC,There's no rule they have to follow. If the market is selling for $20/pack why would they sell as if the MSRP is $10? Supply and demand.
mtgmarketwatch,30qi35,13x13-100,10,Sun Mar 29 21:01:38 2015 UTC,She is also a prime suspect to be in FTV: Angels.
mtgmarketwatch,30qi35,chanmancan,5,Sun Mar 29 22:10:10 2015 UTC,"Imo, pretty hard.  Old copies probably will take a $20 hit while new copies will settle for $15-$20 if it is an exact reprint (ie art and rarity). If it is a different art, the old one will not tank as hard.   Still, we don't know that it is going to be reprinted, so invest wisely. It is a prime suspect due to its play and price."
mtgmarketwatch,30qi35,twilightwolf90,2,Sun Mar 29 22:01:45 2015 UTC,"If she doesn't get reprinted, do you think that she'd rise in price? If so, any idea by how much?"
mtgmarketwatch,30qi35,Lollipopsaurus,7,Sun Mar 29 22:39:45 2015 UTC,"She's already on the way down.  She was a card in Modern Birthing Pod decks, but that's obviously done.  Now the only thing keeping her price up is casual demand.  Looking at the other non-legendary angels, I'd guess she lands around $10-$15 in the long term if she isn't played in anything competitive.  If reprinted, the price will be lower of course.  http://www.mtgstocks.com/cards/1409"
mtgmarketwatch,30qi35,Chisinf,2,Sun Mar 29 23:43:42 2015 UTC,theres no way shes not getting reprinted in one of these products
mtgmarketwatch,30qi35,shor,5,Mon Mar 30 05:46:42 2015 UTC,"If it were reprinted, how far would it drop?   TLDR: I honestly don't think you should worry about a price drop if you are using it in your deck.  The long answer: it depends on knowing what the supply and demand curve looks like for Linvala now and after it gets reprinted (in MMA2015 or elsewhere).  What does supply look like? No one knows whether Linvala is in MMA or FTV:Angels or even BFZ. It makes a big difference to supply where she is reprinted.    MMA2015 is expected to have a much larger print run than MMA Linvala comes from ROE, a 2010 large set that was drafted ROE-ROE-ROE   Where's the demand? I would not underestimate the steady casual demand for her, Linvala is from a popular tribe that resonates with both EDH/casual decks and the foil is highly coveted by collectors.   Linvala does not see Legacy or Modern play (after banning of Pod) She sees some EDH play, but is far from the most played Angel (e.g. Avacyn, Restoration Angel & Angel of Serenity are played more than twice as often as Linvala according to Metamox) Angels are (IIRC) the second most popular casual/kitchen deck tribe after Dragons IMO the most collected tribe (see foil multipliers of zero play angels) Arguably one of the best Angel artwork of all-time There has been five straight years of solid playerbase growth since ROE's release in 2010 When MMA was released, Cryptic Command ($33), Vendilion Clique ($50) & Bob ($54) were the cards nearest Linvala's current $40 mark - all three are now well above their pre-MMA price (all 3 see modern/legacy play, as noted Linvala does not) New version will have the new border, which will help original version hold its price   All in all, the biggest driver of Linvala's price will be the size of the MMA2015 print run, if she's reprinted in MMA. FTV:Angels would be just as likely though."
mtgmarketwatch,30qi35,omegaorb,2,Mon Mar 30 01:29:37 2015 UTC,"I found out I had a foil one sitting in my collection. I moved it to T&T within the week while it was still a $100 card. Dump it now if you can, because a reprint blows the value out."
mtgmarketwatch,30qi35,pudding_addictee,2,Mon Mar 30 03:52:28 2015 UTC,If Linvala is reprinted in FTV:Angels I could see her going somewhere between $5-$10. MM2015 reprint is less severe.
mtgmarketwatch,30qi35,Little_Gray,1 point,Mon Mar 30 08:27:05 2015 UTC,The only reason it is as high as it is right now is price memory.  It sees near zero play now that pod is banned and even without a reprint will continue to drop.  With a reprint its price will most likely crash to the $10 area.
mtgmarketwatch,30lkxx,lilbthebased_god,4,Sat Mar 28 14:02:02 2015 UTC,"Expected Value, or EV, is used when a product or investment is of uncertain return. It is calculated by multiplying the probability of each situation by the payout, and summing all of those.   Regarding the price of Ojutai's Command, it is 3.60 nonfoil and 10 for the buy a box promo. There are extra promos in circulation in the form of prerelease promos, but those do not have sweet alt-art. Personally I think 10 dollars is way too high, compare it to Supreme Verdict, a card for similar decks, which always seemed to hover around 8 dollars during it's standard life. That card was a staple in its format, and occasionally sees legacy play, and never sustained prices as high as Ojutai's Command is now. It seems to look like this card reads better than it plays, or at least just doesn't have a standard home, and thus may be actually the least played of the cycle, including the UB one! My advice: Sell"
mtgmarketwatch,30lkxx,RideTheIguana,1 point,Sat Mar 28 14:56:37 2015 UTC,"I think something that's important to keep in mind is that DTK is a pretty low-value set, so any cards that do have value tend to have their prices inflated.  EDIT: I don't think that means Ojutai's Command commands its current value (hehe) but it will probably stay somewhere above what you would expect for a fringe-playable constructed card."
mtgmarketwatch,30lkxx,2RR,1 point,Wed Apr 1 21:35:19 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind are talking about a promo which's value is not significantly tied to the overall value of the set, opening more or less boxes of DTK has no effect on supply."

mtgmarketwatch,30hnln,jh2015,3,Fri Mar 27 13:41:53 2015 UTC,I picked up 2 playsets of Silumgar's Scorn for $4.50. Could have saved fifty cents over at TCGPlayer but it's just easier for me to click two buttons on eBay. It made a huge splash in the second game on stream and I doubt that deck is alone.
mtgmarketwatch,30hnln,anonytrees,1 point,Fri Mar 27 19:24:26 2015 UTC,Thoughts on Foil Anticipate?  It's going to always see play in standard and could see some modern play as well.  What would be a good cost to go in at?
mtgmarketwatch,30hnln,CigarPete,3,Fri Mar 27 17:07:12 2015 UTC,"It's a common and the foils are already at $12-14. I think the boat has likely passed already for this. Treasure Cruise saw play in all formats and the foils were about $18 pre-banning. If this set sees minimal opening, a la DGM, this may go up, but I don't think there is room in the short term."
mtgmarketwatch,30hnln,Radnortuws,4,Fri Mar 27 20:36:40 2015 UTC,"Impulse doesn't see play in Modern because it's not legal. If it were, i guarantee some of the combo decks would be running it.

mtgmarketwatch,30dkzz,coldfrontkol,6,Thu Mar 26 14:48:18 2015 UTC,"This is a really interesting topic. Under the normal rotation schedule I would be all about buying both walkers as fall rotation targets. This year, however, KTK rotates six months after BFZ is released. Typically, six months before rotation a set is already in decline towards rotation.   All this to say, I have no idea what will happen with KTK block this fall, but it will be very important to watch, because this is the new normal for Standard finance."
mtgmarketwatch,30dkzz,SaffronOlive,3,Thu Mar 26 22:16:46 2015 UTC,"With AOT, it was clear that he would have a big future as he was dominant in RTR block constructed - the most played card in block. As you mentioned, once INN rotated, AOT went above $20.   Sorin was one of the most played cards in KTK block constructed while Sarkhan was not. It's shame that MTGO seems to have stopped firing block constructed events after FRF was released as we've lost one way to identify future Standard staples.  edit: I believe Sorin is a good candidate to buy, while Sarkhan is more of an unknown. Of course, take /u/SaffronOlive advice too, the earlier rotation means there could be a (much) shorter window to buy and then to flip."

mtgmarketwatch,30dkzz,propheseed,2,Wed Apr 1 12:32:15 2015 UTC,"All good points. Well thought out post too. However, for Sarkhan, it hinges on red being a color worth playing in big decks. With the curve dropping for thunderbreak regent, I'd find it hard to not want to play more control-y cards after you have assembled your decks upper curve. No doubt Sarkhan is good, but if it fits into the deck is what matters. Which is where sorin is great! It has many homes and has proven to be a great card in constructed."
mtgmarketwatch,30dkzz,150crawfish,3,Thu Mar 26 15:45:00 2015 UTC,"remember were losing stormbreath, having the versatility in sarkhan makes him still very good, in fact a lot of the new jeskai decks in standard are running both sarkhan and thunderbreak."
mtgmarketwatch,30dkzz,Nitrostorm,2,Thu Mar 26 17:51:43 2015 UTC,"To me, Jace, Architect of Thought provides a cautionary tale for buying 'out of favor' standard planeswalkers before the Duel Deck contents are known.  He was sitting just below $20 when the Duel Deck was released, and steadily slid down to $5 on rotation and now sits below that. Source: mtg stocks.  I would wait until the Duel Deck contents are known before jumping in on either planeswalker."
mtgmarketwatch,30dkzz,davekayaus,2,Mon Mar 30 01:11:59 2015 UTC,"This.  Consider Elspeth, Sun's Champion, as it strongly held a $20 value its entire time in Standard (IMO more consistent than AOT).  Just a month after the duel deck is released she has halved- and I expect her to keep dropping to sub $8 at least in the short term."
mtgmarketwatch,30dkzz,propheseed,2,Wed Apr 1 12:18:17 2015 UTC,"I'm concerned about sarkhans mana. Literally it's only playable in 1 shell and its not like abzan where u can go aggro, midrange or control.   Sorin on the other hand is a solid pick, plus it already proved itself in modern"
mtgmarketwatch,30dkzz,azoriusmoons,1 point,Thu Mar 26 19:00:44 2015 UTC,"You are hedging your beats that either of these cards will see widespread play like Jace did in UW and MUD after the rotation of Innistrad, which can be a risky move because there is no guarantee it will find a home in two Tier 1 decks in the next standard like Jace did.  But on the other hand both cards are planeswalkers, which means they are always a card people want to play with regardless of format or how serious the player is. Additionally Mono red based strategies are always a solid strategy after a rotation so this could make Sarkhan be a better spec than Sorin. Also something may occur in the Abzan deck to cause Sorin to see more play after the Theros rotation."
mtgmarketwatch,30dkzz,DarkReaver1337,3,Tue Mar 31 21:12:45 2015 UTC,I suspect Jace's price is held down by being in a duel deck that you can buy for $20 and that contains a $15 Remand.
mtgmarketwatch,30dkzz,gamblekat,1 point,Fri Mar 27 03:49:32 2015 UTC,"because if Remand gets reprinted in MM2, it will drop to the $3-5 range    Uh, no. Duel decks are cheaper, easier to access and have a higher print run than modern masters 2 will ever have. Not to mention the duel deck printing only dropped Remand from $16 to $11 (It's back at $16 now though), so I can't see how a reprinting in MM2 will make it drop to $3-5"
mtgmarketwatch,30dkzz,SquiddyFish,1 point,Fri Mar 27 23:09:52 2015 UTC,"The thing is, Remand sees much more play than Spell Snare. Spell Snare is usually only a 1-2 of in Twin decks, while Remand is always a four-of and sees play in a bunch of other decks. Considering that there are/were way more copies of Remand floating around and is still 2-3 times as expensive as Spell Snare should tell you something. My point being, Remand is a format staple and won't ever drop that low."
mtgmarketwatch,30d6v2,nathanmasse,5,Thu Mar 26 12:35:12 2015 UTC,I think this is more speculation with the infinite turns deck in modern + addition of narset.  This is the cheapest extra turn card in that deck and all the extra turn spells combo super well with narset.

mtgmarketwatch,3051as,pokk3n,2,Tue Mar 24 19:27:48 2015 UTC,"I like where your head's at, but check out what the ""tuck"" effect cards are worth today.  Not much, right?  The high end tuck cards are maybe $15 for the foil Chaos Warp and $10 for the foil Hinder.  Outside of that, every other card is around $2.  Plus, you mentioned supply of the ""replacement"" cards are really high.  Adding that up, I just don't see it.  I think a lot of the tuck spells will still be played, especially because the most popular ones still remove creatures at instant speed, often for a really low cost."
mtgmarketwatch,3051as,Lollipopsaurus,2,Wed Mar 25 04:27:51 2015 UTC,"Well, let's say that Darksteel mutation hits $2. Even then that represents a significant return, given the buy in is so low. While I said the supply of it was quite high, I think it's because no one's had to buy copies before now. Despite being an uncommon, you only get one per commander deck. Other cards like Declaration of Naught and foil Lignify have really low supplies."
mtgmarketwatch,3051as,Lollipopsaurus,5,Wed Mar 25 14:12:58 2015 UTC,"This article is pretty good on the subject.  So let's say you buy 100 at $0.10 or whatever Darksteel Mutation is at right now. $10, not bad.  That's actually a decent price for 100 cards, but shipping from individual sellers could almost double the cost here.  Even if that card goes up to $2, how many copies will the average EDH player buy? 1? 2 if you're lucky?  Now you're sitting on 100 copies of Darksteel Mutation that you have to buy envelopes, toploaders, pay transaction fees, and pay for postage if you sell on tcgplayer.  How much money are you really making per hour on that?  If you buylist and you're lucky, a store will be buying 20-30 of these for $1.  But like you said, supply is high.  Anyone could fill that.  And all of that is assuming that this particular card goes up because people have abandoned tucks like condemn and oblation in favor of only this card.  It's reprintable in any white commander deck, or even standard.  Even then, you mentioned alternatives like Lignify(I just checked and foils went from $1 to $5 on tcgplayer, I doubt the price will stick), Song of the Dryads, Nevermore, and Declaration of Naught.  I'm not trying to slam you.  If you want to buy in, by all means go for it, but I don't think it's worth the time for me."

You may be better off selling now, BUT Deathmist Raptor's current popularity and synergy with Whisperwood COULD make it a big player. Maybe save one playset just in case?"
mtgmarketwatch,301itk,dr_mareeo,3,Mon Mar 23 18:55:35 2015 UTC,"From what I understand you will be able to find some people who consider all non-English cards pimp, so that shouldn't be too much of a problem. However, when returning to the US will you be buy listing the cards you want to sell? In that case I'd take the opportunity to sell cards while in Europe on magiccardmarket.eu to get a bit more value. But the US dollar has grown stronger against the Euro lately, so you wont earn as much as you would 6 months ago."
mtgmarketwatch,301itk,KingoOfChaos,4,Mon Mar 23 20:26:26 2015 UTC,"Only ones that are really premium are T-Chinese, Japanese, Russian, and Korean.   Otherwise the non-english is usually worth less.  Occasionally certain cards end up being worth more in a language that is normally less due to funny sounding names.  Delay for example in french I believe is 'Retard' an incidental english to french translation that makes little boys giggle."
mtgmarketwatch,301itk,atriusfox,1 point,Tue Mar 24 03:50:24 2015 UTC,I would try to trade into English ones if possible.  Or sell them there.  Buylists here rarely accept foreign cards and unless they are premium languages (doesn't sound like they are) then they aren't going to be in demand here.  Other comments have already said which languages would be considered premium so I won't bother going over that.
mtgmarketwatch,301itk,atriusfox,1 point,Tue Mar 24 03:52:19 2015 UTC,"For many players, foreign cards are the ideal way for them to pimp out their deck.  Some want to go all-out and make their deck foil and foreign, others are not a fan of foils but want to pimp their cards.  Overall, I think there is a steady demand for foreign singles as long as you use every means of selling available to you (aka the internet).  The tricky part can sometimes be finding people who are interested in the language you have.  German is very popular and it will likely be easy to sell your German cards; you'll likely be able to sell them for more than their English Equivalents.    The romance languages however are not very popular.  I don't think it will be difficult to sell them, but it will be the same as selling an English card.  A small percentage of people will want your romance language cards, and a small percentage of people may actually be deterred by them, but overall I find that people are indifferent towards the romance languages."
mtgmarketwatch,301itk,2RR,0,Wed Apr 1 21:42:37 2015 UTC,"I would dump them before coming over. In the order of pimpness  Russian Korean English and other languages  At best you can get the same value as english but having had some of these cards I can tell you they move extremely slow, stores normally don't want them and they sit on ebay (assuming you're trying to get the market price for them)."
mtgmarketwatch,301itk,rp_1,0,Tue Mar 24 00:54:04 2015 UTC,"First off, German isn't a romance language.     As a whole the order of value is - Russian > Korean > Japanese > English > Everything Else  German + T-Chinese may be a bit more if you can find the right person."
mtgmarketwatch,301itk,arsonisfun,0,Tue Mar 24 01:00:01 2015 UTC,"I usually haven't found that much of a problem trading Non-Spanish ones for English (for some reason people don't like Spanish), but unless they're foils you're unlikely to get anything more for any language but German.  German is usually on parity with English with more expensive foils.  I've also found Italian to be more expensive in foil but about equal in English.  I haven't had much experience with French, but those tend to be similar to Italian.  Note: I'm speaking from the point of view of an FNM trader and a serious Pucatrader"
mtgmarketwatch,300o4g,Carnilawl,12,Mon Mar 23 15:11:15 2015 UTC,"Judge promos are a very limited run, and don't really impact the price of the normal cards in any appreciable way.  In addition, not all of the printed Judge Promos even make it to market as, unsurprisingly, many Judges also play Magic and like to keep them to trade.  The Tempest version continues to be a safe hold, as Wizards has shown a long history of unwillingness to reprint it."
mtgmarketwatch,300o4g,Manadyne,4,Mon Mar 23 15:40:14 2015 UTC,They are also much harder to get. More entered the market when they were GP promos since most that were handed out were sold right back to dealers to help cover judge travel cost. The new program will curb that a lot.

They didn't put it in FTV Lands, they're not gonna be putting it in a Commander product, so it's pretty safe to say it's not going to be going anywhere in price any time soon."

mtgmarketwatch,2zu2uu,kahluahandcream,16,Sat Mar 21 19:55:41 2015 UTC,"This blows my mind.  I think the card is solid, but I just can't see it being THAT good.  It's so important that morph/manifest is playable for this card to be good moving forward.  I don't see it maintaining this price.  It's definitely good but I think 7-8$ is where it would end up, not 14$."
mtgmarketwatch,2zu2uu,atriusfox,3,Sat Mar 21 20:04:10 2015 UTC,"The card is insane in the right shell, but that's obviously restrictive. It's not something that stands to become a near-mandatory include if you're playing that color (like Rabble or Rhino) to justify the price over a long period of time. I think the jump is more due to pre-release hype (where morph/manifest is more common) starting to get everyone's creative juices flowing around the card. $7-8 sounds like a good settling point for the card, but if GW Devotion settles in Tier 1 and this card becomes an auto-include in that deck, the limited demand of Dragons could keep the card's price tag up for awhile (ala Whisperwood)."
mtgmarketwatch,2zu2uu,atriusfox,3,Sat Mar 21 20:09:02 2015 UTC,I think the limited demand of DTK could be a factor (good point) but even then I look at GW devotion and think about what I would take out to fit this in and IMO there isn't really anything.  You need the mana ramp and the mana dump creatures.  I actually thought the card would be less than 7-8$ but think the lack of interest in relevant cards in it might get it to 7-8$

Odds are he will because this new set does seem tailored for edh more than competitve decks which means the landscape for standard isn't changing anytime soon.
mtgmarketwatch,2zu2uu,GosuMagic,2,Sun Mar 22 03:47:47 2015 UTC,This card is extremely good value against grindy decks. It's essentially looked at as a free removal against creature decks. The card advantage shouldn't be overlooked. A lot of the pros are brewing with it right now and they seem to like it. It's also a big hit with some of the Japanese players. They were spot on with Tasigur even when most of the USA players thought he was crap.
mtgmarketwatch,2zu2uu,gamblekat,5,Sun Mar 22 03:44:17 2015 UTC,"The biggest problem is that there's exactly one top-tier deck that uses morph/manifest, and Deathmist Raptor doesn't provide it with anything vital. By the time GW Devotion is producing an army of manifests, does it really need to recycle a deathtouch 3/3?  It's a legitimate bomb in limited, and I wonder if people are just overvaluing something based on prerelease that will be much more disappointing when it's not backed up with playable morphs."

mtgmarketwatch,2zwqh1,bigpappyj,3,Sun Mar 22 15:29:28 2015 UTC,"I have combed the TOS. It has two clauses relating to this type of software. One clause against downloading the whole page and user data, of which the bot doesn't do, and one clause against going faster than a human(it goes as fast as a dedicated trader with pagemonitor), which the bot doesn't do. The only thing the bot challenges for paid subscription is email notification? Which was already challenged by PageMonitor. I love PucaTrade, and do not want to harm it. I am talking to the PT developers to make sure everything is okay. I am also forwarding all of the money I make from the first month and putting it into their IndieGoGo campaign. I have been very careful not to do anything bad while at the same time making trades easier for people."
mtgmarketwatch,2zwqh1,Rock-swarm,7,Sun Mar 22 15:55:45 2015 UTC,"Easier for people with the bot, harder for those without. Fixing the ""problem"" with paywall bots is already a grey area, and I would argue that the bot violates the spirit of the ""faster than a human"" clause, if not the letter."

mtgmarketwatch,2zwqh1,gamblekat,1 point,Sun Mar 22 23:03:11 2015 UTC,"Pucatrade seems like it's stuck in an arms race right now. The site is basically unusable without Page Monitor, a pain to use even with Page Monitor, and some people were already using private scripts to grab trades. All things being equal, I'd prefer a system where no one had to grab trades within seconds... but where the site is now, it doesn't seem like I can get any use out of it without automation."
mtgmarketwatch,2zwqh1,tigerbreak,21,Mon Mar 23 00:07:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks for making it worse for the casual users. Most of us don't have time to sit and wait/cycle the page for trades. Puca is supposed to make trading accessible to everyone. Now, if you want to send, your in an arms race with a bot  (who can beat a bot?)  Puca admins: if you read this, I hope you consider banning bots from the site. Don't be suckered by the siren song of velocity, this is going to chase away casual users because we can't compete with the speed of a bot. This bot will ruin Puca for 70 percent of the user base."
mtgmarketwatch,2zwqh1,tigerbreak,-9,Mon Mar 23 01:02:54 2015 UTC,"The bot is just as fast as a normal user, and people have been using bots privately. It won't get worse. The same window of time will exist. All my bot does it make it so you don't have to /sit and wait/cycle the page./"
mtgmarketwatch,2zwqh1,4channeling,5,Mon Mar 23 01:49:44 2015 UTC,"That's not my point.   My point is for that a user to be able to compete with the bot, they'd have to constantly be online refreshing the page to ship stuff. Casual users are now competing against an army of always on bots that will ship things before they get home from work or school. When these casuals can't ship their stuff, the system is going to grind to a halt.   This is a lot like Wal-Mart coming to a small town. More efficient and more resources will grind out the hardware store, the grocery store, the electronics store.   If your bot takes off, Puca will be filled with grinders and shops dumping stuff they can't sell at full value - great velocity in the short term, but once that market dries up, and the same folks who bought the casual stuff run out of points and can't sell because the bots beat them to it, who is going to buy in to get that stuff?  Unless they add bid/ask features, keep it egalitarian and the bots off there."

I am working on a way to hard-limit how many hours a day it can be used. People are already competing against 20,000 EDIT: 40,000 other PageMonitor users, and my bot is about the speed of another PageMonitor user. The great majority of people do not know how to code yet, this bot increases equity by providing a bot to those that cannot code. Several users have come forward that they have been coding and sharing their own private bots secretly. If the bot is shown to be consistently faster than a human, the speed can always be adjusted to where it is more fair for everyone. The bot's power is not in speed but consistency and diligence. I do not think people should have to spend hours in front of their computers each day to just trade some magic cards. You and I know everyone's time is worth much more than that. I knew there would be controversy, as there always is with technological advances, but I have to reassure you that I am doing everything I can to make this bot for the long haul and not adversely affect the site.  if you were to create a bot to automate trades, how would you make this system fair?

Given that this will be the case, it will be only a matter of time until there are two classes of Puca users, bot abusers and everyone else. Puca is now JUST getting out from under the administrative quagmire that the explosive user growth drove to the site. Will the admins really have time to police the bots to ensure they don't violate the site's terms? Also, automated trades will invariably mean cards sent in error, with a ton of cases opened to cancel cards. Would it be wise for the admins to open the floodgates again on administrative work?   Again, creating a bot for this is inviting trouble for the site; Puca is it's users. When casuals can't ship the sweet cards they don't want for stuff they need, or constantly get beaten to trades; they are going to spend what they have and leave for good. Puca will become the daytrader market for bot abusers, and the site economy will grind (heh) to a halt.  Personally, I enjoy being able to log in and take a chance to see if I can ship stuff on my list. I've sent close to a grand so far on here - if the bots are allowed, I will most likely liquidate and move on, as I am sure many others will too."

The admins would be able to find and remove these users easily by looking at collected traffic logs, filtering them, and removing users found to be abusing. Cards sent in error will happen at a rate equivalent to the current rate for sending a group of cards and not reaching your point minimum.

Admins can certainly look at logs, but if they take 3-5 days to review cases, how are they going to police the logs for bot use? There's no getting around it - the use of the bots is going to significantly degrade resources; site and bandwidth resources (when people figure out how to tweak and abuse the bot); man power resources (because Jared and company don't have ENOUGH to do already for the site); and economic resources (casual users leaving the site when they don't pay for misebot and can't beat bot users dumping casual cards).  Look, i'm all for making inefficient markets more efficient but in this case, but Puca is about the inherent inefficiency; it makes it fair and equivalent to the time and effort. Take that away, and this becomes another deckbox."

Someone WILL tweak your source code (and keep doing it) to beat regular users and pagemonitor users. This is going to tax Puca's resources (as I stated above); this isn't static scammers that can be culled from a list weekly, this is potentially a handful of users with tweaked bots hugging the site to a crawl. Should the admins have to handle that additional duty? I wouldn't.   To be clear - your bot (which you are selling) will be tweaked (if this hasn't been miscalculated already) by users you sell it to (good luck enforcing that license you include with the software that says ""please don't modify, mmkay?"") in order to gain an unfair advantage. Mods and site tech staff have more to do (users bitching, extra cases, site getting hugged to death), casuals will disappear (why stay if you can't trade for anything), and as a result, the site economy craters.  Puca has the potential to be lucrative. Personally, i've turned hundreds of ZEN full arts and draft leavings from 5+ years of drafting into a binder full of modern staples. (Chris) Hanrahan has traded into multiple pieces of power. The amount of money in MTG (and the earning power here) can be STAGGERING.

mtgmarketwatch,2zo4vb,wumagic,22,Fri Mar 20 05:09:28 2015 UTC,I'll continue the tactic that has given me the best results the last few years: 0x of everything I usually don't lose too much money on preorders.
mtgmarketwatch,2zo4vb,KingoOfChaos,-1,Fri Mar 20 13:21:42 2015 UTC,"I will say it's fun, but after all but failing on the last few sets, I am hesitant to dive in again.  That being said, once all the dust settles, and you get a better sense of what is what and how game play is trending and affecting the cards, you can be just as successful with calculated buys.  Although its fun to have large quantities of a card bought for next to nothing, they are harder to move.  I went deep preorder on Nightveil Specter only to be distracted and not as able to move the large quantity I had. (obviously buylists were an option)  Still with profit, but wish I had 1 or 2 solid movers instead.  To each his own, it's fun either way.   If I were going to preorder this set, I would get...   Descent of the Dragons (short term) Secure the Wastes (short term) Ojutai (short and long term) Sarkhan (long term) Shaman of Forgotten Ways ( Possibly short and long term, I could see him get banned in Commander)"
mtgmarketwatch,2zo4vb,earthbinder,3,Fri Mar 20 16:26:33 2015 UTC,Why not get into long term cards when its at peak supply???
mtgmarketwatch,2zo4vb,Rock-swarm,5,Fri Mar 20 17:30:03 2015 UTC,I have to agree. Literally zero reason to pre-order Sarkhan or Shaman of Forgotten Ways. Let the community crack the packs and drive the price down for you.
mtgmarketwatch,2zo4vb,earthbinder,2,Fri Mar 20 17:49:12 2015 UTC,"I feel maybe 1 or 2 and trade for more Sarkhans would be sufficient for short term.  But I can see him jumping early and then coming down. Not like Narset who I can see coming down after release. But yes, long term should be bought months later like how we are in peak supply of Khans."

Also, a weird note - I was able to get most of my foil pre-orders through TCG, but channel fireball was the seller. This is interesting because I checked CFB for foil pre-orders and they had none of the cards I wanted. Looks like they allocated a portion of their foil pre-orders specifically to TCGplayer."

I also highly suspect Shattering Spree is gonna be in MM'15 since we're probably going to have enough artifacts to support metalcraft as a subtheme.

If there is ever a payday for any of them - and that is a BIG IF - then that day will be a long time away.  Even if you want a mana rock that turns into a creature / mana sink, I think the dragon rocks from DTK look a lot better"
mtgmarketwatch,2zmoxw,jmarsh642,2,Thu Mar 19 21:45:55 2015 UTC,"Have you experience in bulk com/ uncomm? The thing is that it doesn't hurt to hold on to a few long boxes. One of the guys from brainstorm brewery talks about it. Bulk is not your average spec, but if you know what to do and look for you can make good money. You say no one is looking at these cards. I feel like the keyrunes could grow rather popular in the commander crowds due to the fact that it provides early ramp and then a creature late game. as well as key runes start as ramp and when you no longer need the extra mana you can get a draw out of it. seems ok."
mtgmarketwatch,2zmoxw,jmarsh642,5,Thu Mar 19 21:59:11 2015 UTC,"I do lots of bulk. That is where most of my MTG finance comes into play.  I have boxes full of bulk ""specs"" which are usually cards buylisting from $0.02 to $0.08  Anything north of that I tend to ship. The real value in bulk is velocity. Sure, sometimes all of those Fatestitchers go from junk to money but that is rare.  Keystones are cute. If you want to stash them that's fine but I do not see a lot of upside. They never saw much adaption in standard and I rarely even see them in budget commander lists (and I love budget Magic) Most EDH decks run a handful of mana rocks. I think for my money I'd rather have a rock turn into a dragon than draw a card of turn into a 3/1 First Strike.  That being said if I had to put money on any of the keyrunes I'd look at Dimir and Rakdos. They were the only I've ever seen in a decklist."

When you are trying to figure out if you should hold bulk, you should compare it to other bulk cards. Even the EDH crowd wouldn't play them so that means these keyrunes and cluestones are beyond worthless."
mtgmarketwatch,2zmoxw,jesusice,3,Fri Mar 20 01:57:50 2015 UTC,Keyrunes maybe. The Cluestones are really bad.
mtgmarketwatch,2zk217,KidJustice,6,Thu Mar 19 05:26:35 2015 UTC,"I'd buy a copy if you want one to use, but I don't think this is good speculative target.   Yes, there's room for the price to grow but the demand has to come from the kitchen table Dragon deck (or possibly TL) because it is unlikely to come from EDH.   His ability is usually underwhelming in EDH, as a (typical) turn six 5/5 dragon is nothing great. My usual litmus test for EDH is: is it on metamox most played cards? Does it make Scoeri's MTG-salvation list for most played red-only cards? Do I see in my local scene?  Also agree with /u/pudding_addictee point, this is very likely reprint target, especially with a Dragons-flavored block just about to finish."
mtgmarketwatch,2zk217,shor,3,Thu Mar 19 08:21:42 2015 UTC,"All perfectly valid points, and yet you get downvoted. The card was fringe in standard, and it doesn't see much EDH play because it tends to simply die from splash hate and board wipes.   Sure, this could be a casual hit, but I think the low foil multiplier indicates that people serious enough to pimp out a deck simply don't want this in their deck."
mtgmarketwatch,2zk217,Rock-swarm,3,Thu Mar 19 11:35:52 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised the foil price is still that low, considering its awesome in Commander and Tiny Leaders. Surprised this one's made it through the pre-DTK dragon buyout hype without a spike, too."
mtgmarketwatch,2zk217,kahluahandcream,7,Thu Mar 19 06:13:44 2015 UTC,"I don't think you want this in TL. Do you really want to hit 6 lands? Do you want to have a 1/1 that's not good until then and has to survive until your upkeep?  I don't know from experience, but it seems bad. I'm also pretty skeptical on TL since it's primarily hyped by stores and speculators at this point."
mtgmarketwatch,2zk217,mtd14,3,Thu Mar 19 06:29:27 2015 UTC,"In my experience, it always instantly eats removal. That's a good deal for a one drop, because if it doesn't, it wins the game in short order."
mtgmarketwatch,2zk217,klaxxxon,2,Thu Mar 19 07:52:34 2015 UTC,"I play it as a finisher in my Alesha deck. It's not intended to be dropped early, but rather to close out a grindy game once the land drops have been hit. It's really strong in that role, considering there's not much in the format than can keep up with 5/5 flyers."

It's only a matter of time before players realize for just $4 more one can have a foil version rather than a regular version.  It has been steadily gaining since Feb 2015. Foils are under the 2-4x mult. at some point that will correct, there already isn't that much supply out there.  That all being said, this could be a card that shifts in rarity in a set like MM2015. That's my only concern.  Either way full disclosure; I got a few just in case, rather be proactive."

mtgmarketwatch,2zh6y6,GosuMagic,2,Thu Mar 19 06:31:26 2015 UTC,These decks are supposed to help the average or new player get into FNM but they keep including junk rares that aren't even playable in most decks. I see no value in this at all.
mtgmarketwatch,2zh6y6,IntangibleHawk,2,Wed Mar 18 16:09:11 2015 UTC,"While you are right that most of the rares are not prime time rares, the primary purpose of an event deck is to help newer players get into the competitive scene.  Part of the problem though is that they cannot make the event decks too good, whether that be the value of the cards or the power of the deck itself, otherwise they would just be bought by the competitive players, and the newer players would have a harder time getting a hold of them.  Otherwise, http://www.mtggoldfish.com/archetype/standard-red-deck-wins-16741#paper , a deck like that would be a really good spot to make for a powerful event deck.  Not too many expensive cards that could be substituted for cheaper cards, and the deck would still be very powerful.    I think they are going to probably make the Clash packs more powerful, just due to the fact that they are sold at big box stores, so the odds of supplies running out are a lot smaller than product sold at LGSs.  Overall, the event deck doesn't look bad to me, but it's not a powerhouse, nor is it really that good from a financial perspective."
mtgmarketwatch,2zh6y6,That_Sketchy_Guy,2,Wed Mar 18 19:34:38 2015 UTC,"Well look again. Thunder break Regent and outpost siege are not bad money, and there are a bunch of cards ~$1 like two wild slashes, temple of abandon, savage knuckleblade, and boon satyr. Its hard to tell its total value because of the DTK cards like Surrak and Thunder break Regent, but the whole thing is probably worth about $15"
mtgmarketwatch,2zh6y6,Lollipopsaurus,2,Wed Mar 18 17:32:32 2015 UTC,"Thunderbreak Regent looks like a standard staple, so it might be a good buy.  Often a 4-mana red card ends up as a standard staple.  A 4/4 Flyer for 4 that bolts an opponent when they remove it is pretty good.  It'll likely replace stormbreath once it rotates out."
mtgmarketwatch,2zh6y6,potato1,3,Wed Mar 18 18:21:41 2015 UTC,"A minor quibble, because I agree with most of what you said, but I think Sarkhan the Dragonspeaker is the most likely Stormbreath replacement."
mtgmarketwatch,2zh6y6,GosuMagic,2,Wed Mar 18 19:42:24 2015 UTC,"With the exception of temple and outpost, the rest of those aren't being played. Not only do they have no value, they can't even be played which is worst. Why would anyone dump money into cards that aren't good in tournaments. If I am a casual player, then I'll wait until these bottom out around rotation. Once this gets released, all those cards will drop even more in value. Try and sell it for $15? Goodluck!"
mtgmarketwatch,2zh6y6,Morzas,1 point,Wed Mar 18 18:24:01 2015 UTC,"The idea behind these decks is that the ONLY player who should want to buy one is a new player who just wants a deck. If they put anything valuable in them Spikes would snap them up. When they have valuable cards in them, I bet WotC actually considers that a mistake."
mtgmarketwatch,2zh6y6,Rock-swarm,1 point,Wed Mar 18 20:32:27 2015 UTC,"Not exactly a mistake, but yes the MSRP was quickly ignored for the event deck that had 2 inkmoth nexuses, as well as that deck that had both a verdant catacomb and a thragtusk."
mtgmarketwatch,2zitcf,FranticJ3,4,Wed Mar 18 22:45:40 2015 UTC,"It's certainly a good price for the packs alone.  The storage box and dice are gravy.  This is, of course, if you already intended to buy packs."
mtgmarketwatch,2zitcf,NevPicasso,4,Wed Mar 18 22:58:15 2015 UTC,"2.66 per pack seems decent enough.  Comes out to 95.96 for 36 packs.  If you can get a box for $90 on eBay,  then it's not too good to pass up."

mtgmarketwatch,2zitcf,Rock-swarm,-1,Fri Mar 20 16:10:17 2015 UTC,"If you are fine with sinking the cash, these could be a solid return 4+ years from now. Even sets as recent as Innistrad and new phyrexia fat packs have enjoyed a rather large gain on msrp in just a few years. Granted, those two sets have a good chunk of eternal playable staples, but FRF does have some eternal impact in DTT and tasigur. And a big part oof the fat pack value is tied into the lottery effect of potentially pulling a foil money card."
mtgmarketwatch,2zh2ht,potato1,4,Wed Mar 18 15:10:44 2015 UTC,"This looks like a buyout to me (sudden massive spike in one night).  That being said I think it was undervalued.  The card is actually very good vs infect because they don't go for it unless they have protection and they need turn 1 glistener elf to kill super fast, otherwise they are usually turn 3-4 if they are not disrupted at all.  Shuts down twin and makes it so they need cryptic bounce to go off.  It's good vs lingering souls builds right now which are common.  It's decent vs affinity as well.  Master of Etherium doesn't see a lot of play in affinity.  Still a buyout IMO but the price will likely stick or only drop a bit due to the fact it's an older rare and low supply."
mtgmarketwatch,2zh2ht,atriusfox,1 point,Wed Mar 18 16:33:50 2015 UTC,"I agree with pretty much everything you said here, but I'm uncertain on its final price. I don't anticipate it maintaining this value unless it starts seeing lots more play; a 1-of sideboard card, even one in short supply like this can't be worth that much."
mtgmarketwatch,2zh2ht,atriusfox,3,Wed Mar 18 16:58:39 2015 UTC,Fair enough.  I'm basing my price logic off what we've seen over the last couple years with Lorwyn card buyouts.  The new price sticks mostly because the card is old and scarce moreso than playable.  Champions is even older than Lorwyn and was a relatively unpopular set.  So I would think scarcity is the real player for that.
mtgmarketwatch,2zh2ht,atriusfox,1 point,Wed Mar 18 17:50:52 2015 UTC,What are some examples of what you're talking about with Lorwyn cards?
mtgmarketwatch,2zh2ht,OutofStep,1 point,Wed Mar 18 18:18:57 2015 UTC,"I realize I should have said Lorwyn block, but hopefully I won't get bit too bad for that.  And I know that people are going to argue a couple points so I might as well point out a couple things.  1) All of these cards get played SOMEWHERE.  Usually Commander but some of them spiked due to constructed anticipation that did not pan out.  I've skipped all the faeries stuff (since while it all spiked and came downa  bit taht was due to a unbanning)  2) I'm only going off what I kind of remember cause I made money off some of these cards.  I haven't checked on them in a few months and a couple have come down further.  Still higher than pre buyout spike though.  3) The examples I have are basically all commander cards I think, but I don't see them played anywhere much in commander.  I would expect a relevant sideboard card in constructed to see MORE demand.  4) It can be argued these cards have powerful affects, but can Night of Soul's betrayal (shutting down an entire combo deck, 90%of another combo in poison and a decent chunk of affinity)  With that in mind:   Primalcrux - http://mtgstocks.com/cards/2548  Forced Fruition - http://mtgstocks.com/cards/3138  Bloom Tender - http://mtgstocks.com/cards/2444  Endless Horizons - http://mtgstocks.com/cards/2477  Helix Pinnacle - http://mtgstocks.com/cards/2504  Gilder Barin - http://mtgstocks.com/cards/2491  There may be more but that's what I have for a quick reference.  As I said in my original post, I think the main driver here is scarcity.  The cards get a little bit of relevant spotlight and they shoot through the roof, partial buyout, partial price correction.  Edit: I have 0 copies of this card, knew of it but didn't think it would 'breakout' at all."
mtgmarketwatch,2zh2ht,Snow_Regalia,3,Thu Mar 19 01:26:19 2015 UTC,"It just seems... slow, as a card against Infect and Affinity."
mtgmarketwatch,2zh2ht,Manadyne,1 point,Wed Mar 18 15:21:17 2015 UTC,"The point of it is that it's a trump once you hit turn 4. Your first three turns are spent holding your ground and the boardstate, and then you drop it. It's also relevant in the Junk, Twin, and Esper Mentor matchups."
mtgmarketwatch,2zh2ht,Krond,1 point,Wed Mar 18 15:37:23 2015 UTC,"It is slow, especially against Infect. I think it's intended more as a way to lock them out in a control strategy once you slow them down enough initially."
mtgmarketwatch,2zh2ht,Snow_Regalia,3,Wed Mar 18 16:29:30 2015 UTC,"Meanwhile Illness in the Ranks comes down sooner and still hoses tokens, along with providing protection against Deceiver Exarch and Pestermite combo.  I don't even like it against Affinity due to the Master of Etherium.  Could be decent against Infect, but again, you're going to be in serious trouble by turn 4 anyway.  Do you really want to tap out against Infect to play this on 4?"
mtgmarketwatch,2zh2ht,jjness,2,Wed Mar 18 15:57:37 2015 UTC,"That was my thinking too. I definitely don't see it maintaining $6, even if it remains common as a 1-of sideboard card as it is today. Then again, stranger things have happened."
mtgmarketwatch,2zh2ht,Krond,1 point,Wed Mar 18 16:28:49 2015 UTC,"Yes, I do.  If you resolve this, it is likely that they cannot win the game.  Not saying I'm gonna jam it against them on turn 4 everytime (like if they have 6 cards and 2 untapped Breeding Pools), but holy smokes, this card is good against them.  Illness is insanely good against Twin (if they keep the combo in) and Lingering Souls, but Souls' Betrayal hits a good number of other decks."

I'm surprised it took this long to catch on."
mtgmarketwatch,2zg1r7,GreenShirtedWhiteBoy,-4,Sun Mar 22 15:10:10 2015 UTC,Pretty bad card.  Pretty narrow in EDH. Maybe a poor attempt at a buyout?
mtgmarketwatch,2zg1r7,atriusfox,2,Wed Mar 18 10:39:35 2015 UTC,"Probably not.  Mtgstocks shows the price increase to be over to happen over a month period and buylist price is still (mtgprice.com) around 66% of purchase price Mid and 75% of Low which is not the worst spread either, if it were a buyout the buylist generally would be behind."

mtgmarketwatch,2zec4a,Rock-swarm,2,Tue Mar 17 21:44:31 2015 UTC,"Testing of the modern deck is surprisingly consistent. The deck has very good matchups against affinity and burn, and 50/50 matchups against twin and Junk (twin gets a very powerful hoser out of the side with anger of the gods, however). Also, keep in mind the fact that a TON of people were willing to speculate $10-15 on a playset of congregate on the off chance that it becomes a valid archetype in modern."

mtgmarketwatch,2zdt83,EsportsLottery,2,Tue Mar 17 22:30:25 2015 UTC,One of the worst sets of all time long term value wise.  Just get the cards you want in singles.    Unless this is the best draft format ever it's going to be one of the worst EV boxes possible.
mtgmarketwatch,2zdt83,cyberyder,1 point,Wed Mar 18 18:57:59 2015 UTC,"Eventhough the EV of a box and eternal playable might be important, you have to make sure you hold to a box where the draft environment was fun.

mtgmarketwatch,2zdt83,atriusfox,1 point,Tue Mar 17 19:58:27 2015 UTC,what about russian wanting to draft? i was under the impression that  the baseline price of whatever the booster box will be is Enlish one (because drafting) and then a premium for foil and eternal playable. Russian is just an icing on the cake. maybe DTK won't get the foreign premium you are looking for - you are right in that sense
mtgmarketwatch,2zdt83,Rock-swarm,1 point,Tue Mar 17 20:01:38 2015 UTC,"If you're worried about good draft formats in the future, KTK would probably be better anyways.  Technically we don't know if DTK will be better but KTK is pretty sweet AND exciting to open fetches."

If you are using him - yes. If there is a bunch of people entering modern or legacy - yes. It is a staple in burn. He will be a slow gainer, but is from a small set and is a unique creature.     I know a guy who is selling boxes of KTK for around $80, how long would I have to wait to get a decent return on one?    The set is still print is it not? It'll take a while take RTR boxes as a comparison. Sought after eternal playable cards. Took about a year and a half after it was done being in print to jump to $150 a box.

Maybe that needs to be mentioned that since we're all pretty savvy to give each other discounts on cards we want to sell/buy. QS typically does high buylist+10% for sales to each other
mtgmarketwatch,2z21z1,davekayaus,2,Mon Mar 16 01:55:18 2015 UTC,Yeah good point. I usually try to buy/sell at TCG Low - 10% so sellers get better than they would on TCG and buyers benefit as well. I'll make sure that's included.

Then you have to draw it, then they have to have it matter, ie: have tokens in play, have it hit play and have it stick around.  The decks that would play this could just EoT play it when you don't have it, or counter the enchantment or Erase/remove it somehow.  Definitely not convinced the hoser card see plays unless token strategies actually dominate."

mtgmarketwatch,2ypnf1,James718,2,Wed Mar 11 19:41:59 2015 UTC,"So when the modern index(all the staples in Modern taken as a whole) doubled last year due to the Modern PT and the huge attendance at GP Richmond causing a big spike in Modern interest, a bunch of people sold huge amounts of Modern cards and dumped the money into Legacy staples.   That caused the Legacy staples to rise at a similar rate.   Last March you could have traded a playset of Scalding Tarns for 3 Volcanic Islands. Arid Mesa was worth more than Plateau, etc. Legacy prices corrected.  To your original question, buy the legacy staples first(duals, forces, wastes, etc), because they're more likely to grow slowly over time. The newer cards might jump or drop quicker but they're generally cheaper and easier to find later."
mtgmarketwatch,2ypnf1,worldchrisis,1 point,Wed Mar 11 20:28:27 2015 UTC,I noticed that wastelands have been dropping and ports have been rising. Any reasoning behind this? Should I get wastelands over ports?

mtgmarketwatch,2ypnf1,worldchrisis,1 point,Thu Mar 12 04:14:43 2015 UTC,"Exactly.    During the Treasure Cruise Era, opponents could recover from Wasteland and discard effects (Hymn to Tourach) a whole lot easier.  Easier recovery meant that compared to other times in Legacy history, Wasteland had less of an impact on them.  People stopped playing it as much, and some sold out... much to your benefit!  Port, on the otherhand, is creeping up in price naturally.  There's been only 1 printing, and it was in a hell of a long time ago."
mtgmarketwatch,2ypnf1,IgoRStripes,1 point,Thu Mar 12 06:22:15 2015 UTC,"Port looks steady at 100, Wastes I think have a chance to go up in the post-Treasure Cruise world."
mtgmarketwatch,2ypnf1,blindfremen,3,Wed Mar 11 22:02:47 2015 UTC,"As stated in other comments, the prices of dual lands ""corrected"" as with having had the modern staples spike across the board (the Zendikar fetchlands), it caused the bump for Legacy as well (as people were trading their fetchlands for the ABUR duals; and people realized this was a bit crazy). Since, the Zendikar fetches have settled back down (largely in part to KTK having given Modern access to the allied fetches) for the most part, but the ABUR duals are still much closer to their spike price (as they are on the reserved list, there isn't much of a ""need"" for them to drop back down, which is unfortunate for those looking to get into Legacy/Vintage/etc).  That being said, MM15 may cause another spike in Modern Staples that are not in the set itself. However, I don't believe the spike will be like it was before (for a variety of reasons, which is asked, I can go into a bit of detail; but again that is my speculative look on it)... whereby prices of some cards will trade nearly straight across with the Legacy staples (and, people are a bit more wise to this and may be less likely to do such a trade).   As for your other questions:   Ports vs Karakas. Well, it seems that Karakas seems to be on the rise where Ports are not. Neither are on the reserved list, so a possible reprint could occur for either (however, based upon name, Port seems less likely... unless as a supplemental product [not that likely] or a judge promo [a bit more of a possibility]). This is largely just because of the number of decks using Karakas seems to be higher than that of Port. Moreover, as Goblins decks that used Port have somewhat gone by the wayside, there may be more people trying to offload those currently than that of Karakas (this isn't based upon any numbers, but just seems semi-logical). In any event, I may say that Karakas is the more likely to see a reprint of the two, however, they may be the best to pick up at this moment.   Will Tabernacle drop? It could if something appears that absolutely wrecks Lands to the point it isn't playable at all. People may then want to get out. However, with price memory and with it being on the reserved list, it isn't likely to drop at all. After all, people who bought in don't want to lose tons of money when they get out (and, as stated earlier, price memory is a thing).   As for Staples you should be looking to get... well, anything that's a staple on the reserved list is fairly safe. The only way it devalues is if the game becomes obsolete (and this may mean just the formats that these specific cards are in... i.e. absolute less demand would likely mean that the cards value would drop, as a cards worth is only what someone will pay/trade for it after all), aside from condition lessening (i.e. going from Mint/NM to damaged or whatever). Other staples that have seen some reprints, but only in small increments are not bad to pick up either (i.e. FoW, Wasteland, etc). After all, the most recent case with FoW is that it was only found to have been printed as a Judge Promo (which is still valued much higher than the original as it is a ""foil""). This may show that WotC is aware of the fact that there is a secondary market and they don't want to absolutely crash it. Also, it may mean that R&D deems it to be too strong to put into a Standard set due to implications with Modern, or even just Standard itself.   Again, I'm not a finance expert, nor do I pretend to be. However, these are just things that I see (whether legit or not). As an side, I'm in the market for a Tabernacle and Karakas for a lands deck I was working on... but the prices are so high that I don't entirely know I want to jump in (even though they seem safe-ish)"
mtgmarketwatch,2yoilk,mr_tolkien,6,Wed Mar 11 14:33:03 2015 UTC,When did Wizard make it very clear that no land in modern will stay above a $20 price tag? Link?
mtgmarketwatch,2yoilk,insertcleverid,3,Wed Mar 11 17:47:53 2015 UTC,By reprinting aggressively every single land that was over 20$ in modern. Actions speak louder than words.
mtgmarketwatch,2yoilk,insertcleverid,7,Wed Mar 11 18:07:16 2015 UTC,"I guess my real beef with your comment is the specificity of the $20 figure should be 'clear' to everyone. If WOTC didn't announcement that, then it's just your opinion. If you're basing it on the fact that they reprinted the ONS fetchlands (after 12 years!), and are likely to reprint the Zen fetches, I'd say that's not enough information to support that claim. It may FEEL like they're going to keep churning out shocks and fetches at a greatly increased rate, but that's only what's happening right now compared to 2 years ago. It’s may be true that WOTC takes secondary market bubbles seriously. But the conclusion that R&D uses a specific price-point for popular lands in modern  as the top-down, driving focus of their design choices seems like a leap. I think they have much larger considerations. R&D's goal is to continue to grow the player base. Yes, making premium lands a little cheaper does make sense, but even if those are the most out of line with other popular staples (they’re not), they’re just 10 out of thousands of expensive cards.    It’s probably way more important to them to continue to strengthen brand and grow the lore. I think the top of their to-do list is to flush out the nomenclature. When they made RTR I think their goal was to make the 10 guilds cannon, not to drive down the price of shocks. That was just honey to drive sales.  Now they’re in the process of doing the same thing with the ‘Wedges.’ BUG is now Sultai. RUG is now Temur. To make the set work they saw an opportunity with the ONS fetches. I bet their priorities were flavor first, sales second and the secondary market a distant 3rd if it even made the list.   So why are they going back to Zendikar? From a design standpoint having fetches in just a single set dictates the entire design space of that set, which means it dictates how standard is going to work until rotation, which means whatever the next block may be, it's design space will also be influenced by fetches. Now that they’re changing the rotation schedule, it’s the perfect opportunity. They reprint both cycles back-to-back to minimize the time the fetches will dictate design. Boom.  If their main goal was to keep fetches low then they need to print them A LOT. But, if they print each of the 2 5-card cycles only as frequently as every other year, or every 4th block, it means that Fetches would always be standard legal. Even if they do it every 4 years, the folks in R&D will have to design half the blocks moving forward with fetches in mind for the rest of their careers."

mtgmarketwatch,2yoilk,remyseven,0,Wed Mar 11 19:52:02 2015 UTC,I think they're pretty big suspects for MM2 but I don't feel as sure. I really think they're due somewhere though and selling them if you're not making use of them sounds like a good choice.
mtgmarketwatch,2yoilk,Radnortuws,2,Wed Mar 11 16:03:51 2015 UTC,I will be surprised if the filterlands are in MM2. I suspect the manlands are in MM2 instead.
mtgmarketwatch,2yoilk,pudding_addictee,2,Sat Mar 14 04:00:18 2015 UTC,"Was there some information that Splinter Twin won't be reprinted in MM2? If not, I would put it in this list as well since it's been on the rise recently and also in the potential reprint window."
mtgmarketwatch,2yoilk,bunbunfriedrice,2,Thu Mar 12 13:57:55 2015 UTC,Foil Expedition Maps you should sell as well.
mtgmarketwatch,2yoilk,Krond,1 point,Fri Mar 13 10:27:54 2015 UTC,"Suggestions for whether to sell foils? I have some foil Serum Visions? Pack and promo. They happen to be signed.  I'm also looking to buy foil Mox Opal, but I'm not sure if I should wait."
mtgmarketwatch,2yoilk,bunbunfriedrice,4,Wed Mar 11 15:27:32 2015 UTC,"Original pack foils tend to be very stable.  Take Thoughtseize, or ONS foil fetches.  Theros and Khans were printed in huge numbers, and in normal-priced packs.  Thoughtseize foils didn't even take a hit, while non-foil halved.  Non-blue ONS foil fetches dipped a tad, and then climbed right back up, while blue ones didn't budge.  If you want to squeeze every last dollar out of your cards, you might sell Visions now, and then rebuy 2-4 weeks after MM2 is released, but the gains won't be huge.    It's not like they're gonna plummet.  Keep in mind these are $10 packs, and even if there's a guaranteed foil, there's bound to be lots of chaff, like MM1 (think rebels, tokens, faeries, splice cards, etc.)"
mtgmarketwatch,2yoilk,Krond,1 point,Wed Mar 11 15:49:03 2015 UTC,"I feel like your two examples have exceptions. Both are different artwork. ONS are also much older than Khans AND old-border (which legacy players usually prefer).  What about something like foil Mox Opal? Say it's reprinted with the same artwork. Obviously same border, except now it has the stamp (which people probably tend to prefer). Do you still think its original printing foil will stay the same price?"
mtgmarketwatch,2yoilk,worldchrisis,0,Wed Mar 11 17:31:37 2015 UTC,"You're right, there are some other elements at work in my examples.  I probably could have picked some better cards to use, but my basic point is still true in the vast majority of cases - original pack foils tend to be solid, especially when they see lots of play in competitive, nonstandard formats.  Anywho, back to Serum Visions in particular.  I believe the original foils will hold firm, and FNM foils might dip slightly.  I can't really point to an excellent comparison off the top of my head... I mean, we're comparing a Fifth Dawn common that became relevant to a format invented several years later, and has not seen a reprint in a long time.  Gut just says pack foils will stay strong.  Opal is more iffy I think.  It's only in one deck, and that deck isn't really the hottest thing anymore.  Because it's so narrow, Opal is not a card who's value I expect to grow significantly over time.  In general it's probably not going up by a huge amount unless something happens that makes Affinity a top deck again.  Even so, original pack foils will continue to be the coolest, rarest printing of the card, and I don't see them losing a lot of value because of MM2.  If foil Opals start to drop, it will be because everyone thinks Affinity is just not worth playing (which might be the case)."
mtgmarketwatch,2yoilk,bunbunfriedrice,1 point,Wed Mar 11 17:52:55 2015 UTC,"As an Affinity player, and having talked to a lot of other people who play it at tournaments, I don't think Affinity is a deck that attracts the ""pimp it out"" crowd.   Foil Mox Opals probably have more value amongst the Vintage community."
mtgmarketwatch,2yoilk,worldchrisis,1 point,Wed Mar 11 20:34:06 2015 UTC,So unlikely to drop due to MM2? I want it for EDH. Though I'd be fine with an MM2 one instead.

mtgmarketwatch,2yjjcq,mr_tolkien,-7,Wed May 13 19:40:10 2015 UTC,The point is they're both 'rare' cards from a barely opened set in comparison to how many people play today with a very large upside and very little downside. I wasn't comparing the card side by side.
mtgmarketwatch,2yjjcq,mr_tolkien,4,Tue Mar 10 13:01:27 2015 UTC,MCM has 440 Dack Fayden selling atm. I really don't see an increase in the card price due to availability.
mtgmarketwatch,2yjjcq,shor,11,Tue Mar 10 13:05:39 2015 UTC,"Agree with some of the points raised but why compare Dack to LotV?  LotV   LotV has a home in Legacy and Modern LotV was in INN, arguably one of the most opened sets behind possibly only RTR, THS and KTK - certainly more opened than CNS, a June supplementary product LotV is one of the most played cards in Modern  LotV is played usually as a 3 or 4-of (3.3 average on mtggoldfish)    Dack   Dack is not legal in Modern  Even when played in Legacy it is not one of the more played cards Only appears as a 1 or 2-of at best (1.6 copies on mtggoldfish) Dack is one of the most popular cards in Vintage, the least-played and most expensive constructed format (hence the foil multiplier) Yes, Dack is popular in TL, an up-and-coming format  However, Dack is only half as popular as LotV in EDH, at least according to Scoeri's list, while Dack doesn't break the most played cards on the metamox list   I do agree that Dack will continue to rise in price and there's a always a possibility that it could one day reach LotV price levels, particularly with the low supply of CNS singles. However, it currently has much less demand than LotV, which I believe makes LotV a poor card for comparison.  I also wish I bought a Black Lotus back when it was cheap too :)"
mtgmarketwatch,2yjjcq,mtg_liebestod,1 point,Tue Mar 10 11:37:13 2015 UTC,"Some of the fundamentals do seem to favor Dack.. both supply and reprint risk is fairly low. I'm curious about the print run of Conspiracy when it comes to determining whether to buy in... is it done printing already? Will it be finished soon? That is, has the supply already capped?"
mtgmarketwatch,2yjjcq,pudding_addictee,3,Tue Mar 10 11:22:49 2015 UTC,"I do not know about printing, but I think that speculators/etc. are hoarding unopened boxes of Conspiracy."
mtgmarketwatch,2yjjcq,mtg_liebestod,2,Tue Mar 10 11:38:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm curious as to whether Conspiracy boxes would make a good spec target. iirc the price hasn't gone up any, but they seem like a good long-term hold."
mtgmarketwatch,2yjjcq,pudding_addictee,2,Tue Mar 10 11:42:49 2015 UTC,I think the boxes are a good target. Mythic foils are really valuable and they add some lottery experience for the eventual opener.
mtgmarketwatch,2yjjcq,mtg_liebestod,3,Tue Mar 10 12:01:04 2015 UTC,"I don't think boxes are a good value because of the individual card values, but because Conspiracy is a format that:  a) Will never be reprinted as is (there might be a Conspiracy 2 but it'll have different cards)  b) Will never be flashed back on MODO or whatever  c) Is particularly unique (less so if Conspiracy 2 gets printed)  I think the bottom line is 5 years from now, a lot more people will be looking for sealed Conspiracy boxes than sealed boxes of anything else in standard. I'm not sure how much this will end up driving up prices, but... I just did an RoE draft this weekend. Boxes cost something like $700 each. Is it because the singles are particularly valuable? No - pack EV is barely twice that of KTK. It's some combination of people just either really liking to open RoE packs (crazy) or because the draft format is highly-acclaimed (I'm hoping it's this.) Could something similar happen with Conspiracy?"
mtgmarketwatch,2yjjcq,shor,1 point,Tue Mar 10 12:09:47 2015 UTC,Agreed. If you enjoyed the draft environment of CNS you should stash a few CNS boxes while they are still at RRP.   Pulling foils with huge multipliers is a bonus (particularly for a cube) but for long term gain in sealed product it's hard to go past CNS.
mtgmarketwatch,2yjjcq,kahluahandcream,2,Tue Mar 10 12:30:33 2015 UTC,"I don't know with certainty, but I believe it's done being printed. Right now seems to be the time to buy while it has started to climb slowly. I got 3 copies myself, may get more."
mtgmarketwatch,2yjjcq,alex04009,1 point,Tue Mar 10 11:25:45 2015 UTC,"I'm a huge fan of this card and what it can do, but not in the realm of finance. There isn't enough demand in it in Legacy/Vintage/EDH to warrant ""Tarmogoyf""-like price ranges, and I'd say its a shoo-in to be included in any real life ""Legacy Masters"" type set if it ever does happen. I could definitely see it being a $50 card sometime in the next year, but shelling out $20 a copy just to potentially see a double in return down the long run isn't what I'd consider a good spec."
mtgmarketwatch,2yjjcq,Xfanjaud,1 point,Tue Mar 10 17:59:29 2015 UTC,I can see Dack in the low $30's pretty easy. But I'd rather set aside boxes and cases of Conspiracy. With chase foils at all rarities it will help boxes in the long run.

It's high reprint possibility makes this a HOLD for me. If you got in at ground level ($11-16), you can safely hold on until at least the next Commander spoilers. If anything that makes the foils even more appealing. A 2x multiplier seems low for a card with eternal and casual demand."

I don't think Archfiend is a bad card in this case, but you're talking about a sideboard card that not every deck is going to want to play to combat one deck.

mtgmarketwatch,2yfrwz,Sniffygull,2,Mon Mar 9 14:19:59 2015 UTC,It doesn't shut down Mastery of the Unseen.  It just prevents the GW devotion deck from going extremely wide with it.  Pretty niche sideboard card.

mtgmarketwatch,2yf2yl,mr_tolkien,1 point,Mon Mar 9 08:14:09 2015 UTC,I disagree. I don't see it being viable outside of the whisperwood decks. It might not even be viable when nykthos rotates out. The deck itself hasn't had to slog through a meta prepared to beat it yet. It's certainly the right time to cash out.

mtgmarketwatch,2yf2yl,chrisrazor,2,Tue Mar 10 09:34:29 2015 UTC,"I absolutely agree that the usual concerns of power level and interactivity do not apply here. I am just thinking of time management.  Just as an example, this weekend we saw a game go to time in the first round. Both participants had well over 300 life. They both just gave up during the extra turns because they saw that no resolution was coming any time soon.  I am just thinking logistically a tournament wants to keep things moving. Imagine everyone being finished and waiting an extra 30 to 40 minutes between each round because one matchup had GW Devotion mirrors.  We realistically could have seen the SCG tournament end without the finals having been played because they had to close up when their time at the venue expired. That would have been bad all the way around."
mtgmarketwatch,2yf2yl,jmarsh642,1 point,Tue Mar 10 14:55:28 2015 UTC,"But if that deck garners a reputation for going to time with no resolution, players who want to actually win will opt not to play it, won't they?"
mtgmarketwatch,2yf2yl,chrisrazor,2,Tue Mar 10 15:03:22 2015 UTC,That depends. Players will play the decks that they feel give them the best chance at success (however they define that) There are a lot of powerful cards in the deck and it can go ridiculously over the top of other strategies (Genesis Hydra for 15? np)  Players will play whatever is legal in a format if it is powerful enough.

mtgmarketwatch,2yewcy,JulianNDelphiki,10,Mon Mar 9 07:32:52 2015 UTC,That site has some conflicting information. FRF Box EV - $145.44 FRF Pack EV - $2.93  Those numbers don't add up.
mtgmarketwatch,2yewcy,mtg_liebestod,5,Mon Mar 9 07:58:54 2015 UTC,"It also factors in bulk values, which dawnglare (imo rightly) disregards. You're not going to be able to get a dollar for your FRF commons in a pack, sorry.  Admittedly I'm not sure if dawnglare takes into account foil prices or fetches in FRF, which should bump up the set's value a bit.  In any case, though, the way this site calculates EV puts the EV of FRF below that of KTK or M15. What's wrong with that?"
mtgmarketwatch,2yewcy,Rock-swarm,0,Mon Mar 9 13:56:30 2015 UTC,"Only thing I can think of is the database factoring in the 1-2 fetches per box of FRF, but somehow not applying those fetchland values to a single pack."
mtgmarketwatch,2yewcy,MerryChoppins,3,Mon Mar 9 11:31:40 2015 UTC,I'm fairly curious where Ugin will settle long term (post standard). He seems like an autoinclude in 95% of commander decks. I don't think he's good enough for tron.   $20? $25?
mtgmarketwatch,2yewcy,Rock-swarm,-1,Mon Mar 9 05:22:16 2015 UTC,Karn's price trajectory is a good analog. The real deciding factor is whether or not he escapes a duel deck reprint.
mtgmarketwatch,2yewcy,MetalFearz,1 point,Mon Mar 9 11:34:09 2015 UTC,"Karn is being played in Modern, I'm not sure Ugin is played as much in this format."
mtgmarketwatch,2yewcy,C_Terror,2,Mon Mar 9 14:54:09 2015 UTC,Ugin's being played in the Tron decks as well. Difference is that Karn is a 4x and Ugin is a 1 or 2
mtgmarketwatch,2yewcy,1337N00B5T3R,1 point,Mon Mar 9 16:40:21 2015 UTC,Ugin just recently started seeing play in the mono brown deck in Legacy. I can't remember the name but they make a ton of mana to cast artifacts and stuff.

mtgmarketwatch,2yewcy,1337N00B5T3R,1 point,Mon Mar 23 17:57:10 2015 UTC,Yep that is the one.
mtgmarketwatch,2yewcy,GrossoGGO,1 point,Mon Mar 23 19:09:08 2015 UTC,"Karn is currently played in modern, but he wasn't always. Karn dropped to $10-$15 before he found a home in modern. Ugin could do the same."
mtgmarketwatch,2yewcy,150crawfish,1 point,Mon Mar 9 18:59:29 2015 UTC,The only card in there that has value beyond its playability is mentor. It doesn't see much play at all and still commands a +$20 price tag. That is the only card that needs a price correction.
mtgmarketwatch,2yewcy,Rock-swarm,2,Mon Mar 9 16:02:24 2015 UTC,"Brutal hordechief is in a very similar position. It sees play in 0.4% of all top 8 decks in the last 2 months, according to MTGTop8, but still carries a $6.50 price tag. Monastery mentor is at 3.2% and $22, respectively.  It's very annoying from a speculation standpoint, because I've been waiting for the prices to fall on both cards before I pick them up. Perhaps the casual market is propping up the prices on both?"
mtgmarketwatch,2yewcy,150crawfish,1 point,Tue Mar 10 07:35:57 2015 UTC,"Warriors is a great casual deck that has enough going for it for FNM and things like that. Mentor has the interesting issue of being a known good card because of pyromancer, but has yet to find a home. Post rotation, it should see play. It'll have its day, but not anytime soon"
mtgmarketwatch,2yewcy,WaffleSandwhiches,1 point,Tue Mar 10 15:52:54 2015 UTC,"I agree. Monestary mentor is a good card lacking a dominating deck basically. RW aggro is great but not the ""best deck."" But its still a great mythic that had lots of hype behind it, and ecause its so similar to young pyromancer I would be leery to just unload my playset (I went hard on jeskai aggro for my fnm)"
mtgmarketwatch,2yewcy,SaffronOlive,1 point,Mon Mar 9 20:03:21 2015 UTC,"I think you're focusing too much on Standard as far as Mentor. He's seeing a ton of play in Vintage (not that vintage drives prices in paper), and also picking up a bit of steam in Modern. I expect him to be the most expensive mythic in the set when all is said and done, assuming Ugin follows Karn's trajectory and ends up $15 or $20."
mtgmarketwatch,2yewcy,mtd14,1 point,Wed Mar 11 01:18:06 2015 UTC,"What's interesting, is that over the past week the price of it on MODO has actually gone down around $8/set. Right now a complete set trade in is only $112.  I think Ugin has a long way to fall, along with Monastery Mentor. I expect Ugin to end up around Nissa prices, and although Monastery sees some play across formats I don't see it over $15."
mtgmarketwatch,2yewcy,Volition85,1 point,Mon Mar 9 05:45:10 2015 UTC,"I agree. Unless a modern deck abuses monastery mentor, it will most likely fall.   With BoZ coming up, and if it has eldrazi, there would certainly be a colorless matters theme going on, so it will be prett y hard to judge Ugin. On one hand, there might be good accelerants to cast an early Ugin. On the other, the minus ability on ugin might be less powerful. We can only wait and see."
mtgmarketwatch,2yewcy,SaffronOlive,1 point,Mon Mar 9 05:51:18 2015 UTC,"Monastery mentor is such an interesting card, seeing play in that esper mentor deck.  I don't watch vintage, but my friend was saying that he was being used by the pros this weekend in vintage Masters, popping him out first turn then swinging for lethal t2.  That being said, he is overpriced.  Although it is a small set mythic, it isnt a voice of resurgence. Even voice cannot sustain that price."
mtgmarketwatch,2yernc,MrForgetful,9,Mon Mar 9 04:25:12 2015 UTC,"I could see it, it blanks 80% of removal in modern. I think liliana/wipes are the only maindeck answer.  72.5% of statistics are made up on the spot."
mtgmarketwatch,2yernc,impureanger,2,Mon Mar 9 04:57:18 2015 UTC,"Problem is, he can't beat a Goyf in a fight"
mtgmarketwatch,2yernc,TheRedComet,3,Tue Mar 10 18:00:01 2015 UTC,"It is a good card, but it costs 5. That is way to slow. Sure it breaks the mirror, but tight plays and knowing what your doing is just as effective and doesn't lose you sideboard slots."
mtgmarketwatch,2yernc,150crawfish,1 point,Mon Mar 9 05:04:12 2015 UTC,You can say the same about batterskull  being slow.
mtgmarketwatch,2yernc,KidJustice,1 point,Tue Mar 10 07:59:04 2015 UTC,"Bingo. Sigarda sees a tiny tiny bit of modern play as a mirror breaker for Junk, but honestly the entire point of playing Junk in modern is that decks don't really have a ""hoser"" against the archetype, outside of sticking a combo. Wilt-Leaf Liege is the closest example of something that breaks parity and has potential for a blowout."
mtgmarketwatch,2yernc,Rock-swarm,2,Mon Mar 9 11:37:35 2015 UTC,"If an esper control deck ever breaks through in Modern, which feels a bit unlikely. I know something showed up in Japan this weekend, but they're always doing crazy things. Maybe there is some upside far in the future, but nothing near.   The foils look like they already have a bit of movement, since I bought one just yesterday for EDH at $7.95 and now it looks like $9 is the lowest on TCG. That being said, there are still $8.40 copies elsewhere so not actually that much movement."
mtgmarketwatch,2yernc,mtd14,2,Mon Mar 9 05:15:11 2015 UTC,"Tarmogoyf. As good as BBoV is vs. Abzan in many ways, the fact that it can be eaten by a commonly played 2cmc creature is a huge downside. As it stands, I'd probably rather run Sigarda since she is literally unanswerable and can block all of their commonly played cards profitably save a 5/6 Goyf while dodging all removal including LotV's edict."
mtgmarketwatch,2ycrlb,jh2015,9,Sun Mar 8 17:55:54 2015 UTC,"This is what Travis Allen says:   http://blog.mtgprice.com/2015/03/07/mtgfinance-what-were-buying-this-week-march-7th15/  See the Unwritten: Something will be battling against our heroes for Zendikar in the fall, and it’s a pretty safe bet they’re the Eldrazi. Who doesn’t want to dump the new Emrakul and Ulamog into play with this? At a little over $1 each, the card doesn’t even have to be good. People just have to think it will be in order to make a profit here."
mtgmarketwatch,2ycrlb,MeggidoX,1 point,Sun Mar 8 18:55:25 2015 UTC,"So this card has already almost doubled.  When I posted this it was $1.87 TCGMid and now, 3 days later it is $3.50 TCGMid.  If with no real gas this card can double, I am envisioning around $7 when the massive Eldrazi get spoiled.  Again the card doesn't have to be good for this to happen.  It simply has to be appealing and fun.  If the card actually becomes good, you're looking at $10..."
mtgmarketwatch,2ycrlb,mtd14,1 point,Thu Mar 12 19:03:24 2015 UTC,Just picked up 20 from my LGS@$1.50/each  Something a lot of people aren't mentioning is that Pucatrade is going bonkers with this card. 3 days ago only 2 people wanted it now its like 30 and its doubled on their site for what it's worth. I think 7-10$ it will top out at. Also as far as eldarazi are we sure that battle for zendikar will have them? Seems like everyone is just guessing unless someone knows something in the lore that leads to that.
mtgmarketwatch,2ycrlb,Morzas,0,Sat Mar 14 05:21:09 2015 UTC,"The problem I see is that if you are in green and have 6 mana, you have other finishes you can play instead of playing this and hoping to hit something better. Instead you can be using Mastery to get incredible card advantage, Sagu Mauler for a hard to deal with threat, Tasigur to get card advantage, Whisperwood Elemental for advantage and wrath protection, etc.  If you're in a Temur deck enabling ferocious, the best build is probably aggro like what we've seen at GP Miami with the Shaman, Frost Walker, Flamewake, Stormbreath, etc."
mtgmarketwatch,2ycrlb,mtd14,2,Sun Mar 8 19:02:09 2015 UTC,"This isn't a spec banking on Standard playability, but on suckers who want to live the dream."
mtgmarketwatch,2ycrlb,Chosler88,1 point,Sun Mar 8 19:57:13 2015 UTC,"I'd rather bet on a card being good than people thinking it'll be good. Remember Mana Bloom? Also, people are much less predictable."
mtgmarketwatch,2ycrlb,Ottimo-Massimo,2,Sun Mar 8 20:36:16 2015 UTC,"I do. I was adamantly against that spec, but I kept hearing ""but all that matters is people think it will be good!""   That matters if we're talking about an old card with limited printings. When you're talking about in-print Standard rares, that's not how it works.   See the Unwritten is a Mythic, and Summoning Trap was a 4-of when Eldrazi were around last time. Wouldn't be surprised to see it fill a similar role and climb because of that."
mtgmarketwatch,2ycrlb,mpomerantz,-1,Tue Mar 10 06:16:57 2015 UTC,"also, people are much less stupid than usually predicted! So if the card ISN't good, chances are that nobody will think it is... a speculation is good if the card it hits is good; you can't tie your success to thousands of players just making a mistake in evaluation."
mtgmarketwatch,2ycrlb,w00tthehuk,2,Sun Mar 8 20:57:55 2015 UTC,"Really, you think this fall when spoiler season rolls around and new eldrazi are all the rage, people aren't going to get hyped up and spend money on cards that they want to play with in their eldrazi ramp decks? They're just going to sit on their hands and nothings going to spike? Have you ever witnessed spoiler season before? Look at what's going on with the dragons right now. Remember how replenish, serra sanctum, and all the enchantment stuff spiked on the strength of enchantments in theros which have a fraction of the mainstream appeal as eldrazi? Remember how xenagos and keranos spiked before khans because people speculated that they might be good in the new standard, probably won't be bad.  This card is going to blow up when eldrazi start to be spoiled."
mtgmarketwatch,2ycrlb,w00tthehuk,1 point,Mon Mar 9 06:21:44 2015 UTC,"With Ulamog basically being confirmed(at least the art spoiled suggests so), we can imply 10+ cmc Eldrazis in BfZ. I love the spec and with them sitting at around 1-2€ in europe its not a bad spec at all. At worst they will go down to 1€ long term, but since it has huge casual and Commander appeal, i think it will grow in the long run anyway."
mtgmarketwatch,2ycrlb,GosuMagic,1 point,Wed Mar 11 23:40:48 2015 UTC,"There will be Eldrazi and people will want to play cheesy Eldrazi decks. And depending on what else gets spoiled to support Battlecruiser magic, the spec could easily pay of. In the worst case it is still a commander all star, so if you don't get your money back now, you will at least in 2-3 years."
mtgmarketwatch,2ycrlb,zszugyi,1 point,Wed Mar 11 23:38:28 2015 UTC,it's at a low enough price that I feel it's worth speculating on. I wouldn't go heavy like 200 copies.

mtgmarketwatch,2ycrlb,WigginIII,-3,Mon Mar 9 02:36:41 2015 UTC,"Comparisons to Tooth and Nail are relevant here, but it's worth remembering why Tooth and Nail was a thing: Mephidross Vampire and Triskelion.  If you are speccing on See the Unwritten, you are implicitly speccing on cards that haven't been printed yet, any may not be. This could simply be another Wild Pair."
mtgmarketwatch,2y9f6t,jh2015,2,Sat Mar 7 18:36:21 2015 UTC,"There were only 4 Lightly-Played foils on tcgplayer when I checked last night, so it's not a huge buyout. The buyout probably happened a bit before, grabbing all the NM ones."
mtgmarketwatch,2y9f6t,edmonto,3,Sat Mar 7 19:01:31 2015 UTC,Probably a very overrated combo at this point.  Collected Company is great but this combo is still a two card combo requiring at least 5 lands and in colors with little control or deck manipulation like twin.
mtgmarketwatch,2y9f6t,EsportsLottery,1 point,Sun Mar 8 05:06:53 2015 UTC,Don't you need a murderous cap to win? Kitchen finks only gain infinite life right?

mtgmarketwatch,2y9f6t,Snow_Regalia,2,Sat Mar 7 19:56:27 2015 UTC,"Yes, but in most matchups infinite life gives enough time to stall until you can find Redcap w/ Melira for infect.  Or other decks will mill faster than you because they are drawing more cards.  This is definitely relevant against Twin though, I didn't think of that."
mtgmarketwatch,2y9f6t,GosuMagic,1 point,Sat Mar 7 18:51:35 2015 UTC,seems like storm and twin can be a turn ahead of it.

mtgmarketwatch,2y9hc2,jh2015,9,Sat Mar 7 18:54:48 2015 UTC,"[looking at NM]  Snapcaster is already $41/copy for a single playset on TCG. The next person to buy will be paying closer to $44/copy. eBay has a similar trend, and many other stores are sold out. If your end price is $48/copy, and you're buying at $44/copy, you're not making money after fees. I agree that it could be $48 in September if it doesn't see reprint, but at this point it's too late in the game to make much off it. Anyone that's not already in should probably stay out, unless they're buying to play with them."
mtgmarketwatch,2y9hc2,mtd14,7,Sat Mar 7 19:35:43 2015 UTC,"I was gonna say the same thing. Unless something crazy happens, the ship has sailed on this spec.  This should have been specced months ago in my opinion."

It'll take a bit of time to hit that high of $50 which is where many people believe it should be and unless it gets spotlight in a big way, we'll have to wait.

mtgmarketwatch,2y9941,atriusfox,2,Mon Mar 9 04:45:17 2015 UTC,"This card isn't going to break right now (or soon IMO).  The price increase correlates to MTGO price increases as this card saw more sideboard action (and sometimes main).  http://www.mtggoldfish.com/price/Fate+Reforged/Mastery+of+the+Unseen#online  The paper price is just coming up cause tech gets adopted faster on MTGO.  You can see this all the time (and is sometimes a great way to find out a card is about to spike IRL).  For example go looke at Anafenza around December I think.  Online spiked to 11tix or something and then the paper price followed in another few weeks.  If we look at where the card is being played, it's mostly sideboard actions which is going to keep the card at likely less than 2$.  If it starts seeing mainboard things might change but I highly doubt it."

mtgmarketwatch,2y9941,mtd14,2,Mon Mar 9 01:37:05 2015 UTC,"I think a good bit of the price increase is speculation on the rare megamorphs we've seen. Yes it has seen a bit of play, but not enough to warrant how quickly the price has changed given how many copies are out there.   I don't really see a way this card gets ""broken"", just based on how expensive it is to activate and you have to take a turn off to cast it. I think that limits it to standard and EDH. For standard, I can't say how much the ceiling is for regular copies. For EDH, I like the Ugin's Fate Promos but not sure they have much room to go from the $7-$8 they are now. It seems like the price is already quite high."
mtgmarketwatch,2y9941,TheRedComet,2,Sat Mar 7 18:38:10 2015 UTC,"Good point on the correlation between megamorph and this card. Perhaps as we get more cards spoiled, there may be even better interactions. I believe you're right, Standard will prob not break this card, but if it starts seeing more use as a combo piece in another format or continues to be a mana sink in standard, it may see significantly higher gains.... (pure speculation at this point)  I also agree that the price of Ugin's fate make that version hard to buy into at this point. Prerelease versions are heading up as well. Pack foils are still at a minimum and regular versions are where I'm going to throw a few bucks at. Seems like  harmless way to blow my lunch money lol"

mtgmarketwatch,2y9c7e,Bigbadbear888,3,Sat Mar 7 18:10:14 2015 UTC,I think you're better off waiting until rotation to pick them up.  They will likely go back down to 3$ or less.  Long term I could see them being relevant but most of the demand right now is for 4 of's in competitive decks.  Not 1 of's in Commander.  Rotation will kill that demand.

Thoughts?    Are you using them now? Keep them. You won't lose much value especially if you're able to play with them in the mean time. You'll lose a percentage selling these now at the same price (say 10-15% for TCG or eBay, so ~$20 each - $165), and have to buy them back at the release price of about $150 or so plus tax...so back to $160ish.  If they were rare I'd consider it, but at mythic and being in hand right now I don't think the price difference will matter that much.

Having said that, (and the alleged Elesh Norn reprint), I would dump anything non-foil that has to do with Phyrexians for now.  In addition, MM2013 reprinted a few expensive EDH cards, so keep an eye on reprints for those.  Look at the draft archetypes in MM2013, and think about what archetypes weren't represented. Those are likely to receive a reprint.  Landfall, metalcraft, at least one original Ravnica archetype, and many others are possible.  Look through those archetypes for expensive rares, and unload those.  Information we know for sure includes Metalcraft and at least one Eldrazi will be reprinted.

This coin is probably a $300- 350 coin retail. I have it listed at $600. I know it isn't a $600 coin, but I have the market monopolised.

mtgmarketwatch,2xwiiv,WUBRG-MTG,4,Wed Mar 4 13:06:53 2015 UTC,I think Doubling Season gets reprinted in irregular intervals. Will the reprints be non-foils or foils I do not know. In any case Ravnica (original) foils are quite safe investment meaning they at least hold their value.
mtgmarketwatch,2xwiiv,pudding_addictee,3,Wed Mar 4 13:12:45 2015 UTC,"Doubling Season is actually a hard one for Wizards to reprint. It would be too powerful a preconstructed Commander product. They don't like what it would do with Planeswalkers in Standard. The card was in the last modern masters and has already been a judge promo. It's pretty much not going to be printed in any known way outside of a From the Vault or a Commander's Arsenal type product (unlikely). The original printing's art is unlikely to get reused so that makes your printing an even better hold.  Regarding use in Modern there is some grumbling about a UG deck that Travis Woo was hyping for a while. I think the price increase is more Ugin than anything else. Ugin is the first walker in a while to look absurd with Doubling Season so people are eating it up and the supply is drying up.  I wouldn't expect it to jump to $100 (it's not in demand enough like format staples), but it is a solid bet to hit 60-80 in the next couple of years."
mtgmarketwatch,2xwiiv,BelcherSucks,3,Wed Mar 4 14:59:02 2015 UTC,"Exactly the reasons you outlined are why I expect to see it in a FTV or other limited release product. The thing has insane commander appeal, and every FTV set since relics has been commander focused. They also might use it for some sort of organized play or other promotional thing not judge program.   I think they want to keep the supply existent but not abundant without putting it into standard because it's an autoinclude in so many green commander lists. It made no sense in modern masters other than it's commander appeal and it was included. They didn't print many )(any?) other random ""good"" rares that people brew with from ravnica block."
mtgmarketwatch,2xwiiv,MerryChoppins,1 point,Thu Mar 5 08:13:18 2015 UTC,"Doubling Season is one of the most abstractly powerful cards in Modern legal sets. It's mana cost just limits it potential. So while it isn't tearing up the Pro Tour it was much more appreciated than Countryside Crusher or Death Cloud, cards that havehad more success.  It's not likely to be in the next FTV (I don't know how they can argue its relation to angels) so it will be at least a year. It could easily be at least two years given how far in advance they work on those products."

I don't see stormbreath being playable in other formats so he'll probably drop a lot. The temples are playable in EDH but it will probably take years before they gain value.

mtgmarketwatch,2xsod0,BelcherSucks,2,Tue Mar 3 18:02:08 2015 UTC,"Best time to sell before pieces fall is pretty much feb-march. Once you hit April/May, and even later, you will see prices begin to decrease, and sharply.  Although every year some cards break out and spike before rotation. Last year it was legion loyalist.   If your like me and can't even attend FNM, selling whenever prices are high is just a rule of thumb. If your goal is to stay competitive, you'll feel obliged to hold them longer. Still, sell before May."

Protecting your creature generally isn't used unless you are doing something broken such as infect, and the other mode is useless in a lot of matchups, ie. affinity, twin. The size of creatures in modern is pretty small so it doesn't have the best pool of targets. It would be best as a sideboard card but other cards just do either effect better and the flexibility it offers isn't huge. The best location for this is edh since huge creatures are popular and protecting your giant guy is more worth it. I don't think edh demand will make this card retain it's price value."

mtgmarketwatch,2xmjir,jimini-christmas,-8,Mon Mar 2 13:54:18 2015 UTC,"Are any of those competitive formats ? No. It won't go much higher as the demand from those will stay quite constant.

Conspiracy has been opened quite a lot in the end, and can still easily be bought. I think it won't go much higher than 250$, which is already quite a lot of money."

mtgmarketwatch,2xmjir,GosuMagic,6,Mon Mar 2 03:15:00 2015 UTC,mm2 won't see it reprinted as it isn't legal in modern
mtgmarketwatch,2xmjir,deadcrashtestdummy,-6,Mon Mar 2 03:21:33 2015 UTC,it's not legal because conspiracy isn't legal. That has no bearing on whether cards will be legal in modern if they were reprinted in a new set.
mtgmarketwatch,2xmjir,GosuMagic,4,Mon Mar 2 03:24:43 2015 UTC,So you think it will be printed in a set before MM2 and then reprinted in MM2?

mtgmarketwatch,2xmjir,jjness,1 point,Mon Mar 2 03:27:26 2015 UTC,correct. So they would have to start by reprinting him in a standard set first.
mtgmarketwatch,2xmjir,GosuMagic,0,Mon Mar 2 04:13:09 2015 UTC,It seems to me like it's certainly a re-printable card.  I don't think he would be too powerful for standard right now either.

Most of the backlash that came about the last two weeks was just a rebuttal on how wrongly we were accused of affecting the price of Ghostway. We provided proof on how wrong they were and how they were also doing the exact same thing they were complaining about. I'm sorry if some of the writers feel offended but there was legitimate proof that they (including their writers) were affecting the market. The argument was used just to show how off base their accusations were and was by no means an attack on writers. I feel the first half of your post should be sent to the mods of /r/mtgfinance and that one brainstorm brewery member as they are the ones you should be pleasing because the majority of us don't care where you put your money.

mtgmarketwatch,2xlmjy,ray_area,2,Thu Mar 5 02:58:13 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the late reply, (again don't check on reddit as often).  To answer this question as best I can, when I feel I want to have a playset for myself, I will usually just spec an extra set. This way my ""spec"" set pays for my personal set + maybe some profit. If that makes any sense. In the instance of Outpost Siege, (or another card I feel like the ship has sailed) I will scoop up a cheap play-set, with the option to sell. Virtually any card I own (outside the decks I actively play) have the option to sell, or are purchased to be sold for profit.  I don't really ""speculate"" as much as I did when I first started playing the finance game. There's just too many scenarios a card can be reprinted. I stick to cards I see moving slowly, showing up in stock daily winners multiple times, or cards proving themselves in a real world setting. I suppose the ""Tiny Leaders"" cards can be categorized as that, but again, the cards are proven in that format."

mtgmarketwatch,2xj2wc,rp_1,2,Sun Mar 1 04:10:37 2015 UTC,I usually do 1 of three things:  1) Buylist for cash 2) Buylist for a sealed product (since the ebay rates are pretty close to retail rates) <=this is a pain to ship though 3) Identify cards that have close to ebay values and grab those and ship them (like underground seas or tarmogoyfs)  Just be cognizant of how much time and work it will take you. If option 3 nets you only 10$ more after a lot more work it's not worth it.  You can also post on places like MOTL forum with a lot price along with highest buylist and see if anyone will take it. There are a lot of quasi dealers who will buy this stock since it's at buylist prices.
mtgmarketwatch,2xj2wc,shor,2,Sun Mar 1 04:34:21 2015 UTC,"If you value your time, I would recommend buylisting. The time you save on packaging & posting is usually worth the hit.

mtgmarketwatch,2xh1ik,mistercimba,3,Sat Feb 28 16:53:00 2015 UTC,"Low price is $7, and there are a ton of copies for $7-10 on TCG as the time of this posting, so I wonder what's going on."
mtgmarketwatch,2xh1ik,mtd14,1 point,Sat Feb 28 17:17:43 2015 UTC,"It's been seeing play in infect for a while, so it should be rising in price. It seems like someone decided to just take care of that and force the Legends to rise now via buyout."
mtgmarketwatch,2xh1ik,Rock-swarm,1 point,Sat Feb 28 17:10:02 2015 UTC,"Conspiracy theory - with SCG hosting their first Modern Open, I could see a significant number of vendors re-listing the key cards of infect at a higher point in anticipation of the SCG grinders giving Infect a good showing. Most of the other cards in infect are experiencing the same trajectory right now, specifically vines of vastwood and might of old krosa. Curiously, the foils of those cards aren't jumping. But the foils of groundswell and mutagenic growth are. It kills me that the entire non-land portion of infect can still be foiled out for around $350 (minus noble hierarchs)."
mtgmarketwatch,2xhuqj,Encendi,2,Sat Feb 28 21:02:48 2015 UTC,"Personally I bought a playset on MCM last week (1e each) for personal use. The card is inherently pretty strong, and 1e is pretty cheap for a foil rare. I have no clue if they'll go higher one day."
mtgmarketwatch,2xhuqj,mr_tolkien,2,Sat Feb 28 22:27:43 2015 UTC,"Like I said when I posted, there were pretty much no copies available anywhere. I didn't add it to the post, but when I check the quantities of a card available I check TCG, eBay, SCG, CK, Abu, and CFB. There were 11 copies (not vendors) on TCG, I recall fewer available on eBay and the rest at 0-3 copies.   Since I'm sure I wasn't the only one who noticed it on camera and saw it look good. It looked powerful enough for modern, and the EDH player in me thought it could even carry weight there."
mtgmarketwatch,2xhuqj,mtd14,1 point,Sat Feb 28 23:18:40 2015 UTC,"It's seeing some play in modern graveyard-based decks and is becoming increasingly popular in EDH decks, especially Sidisi builds. Not sure that necessitates a buyout but it doesn't seem to take much these days."
mtgmarketwatch,2xg84x,StefanoBlack,6,Sat Feb 28 10:08:46 2015 UTC,"I would probably keep, even if it does drop later it won't be by much and you're better safe then sorry in case it spikes later. Just my opinion though."
mtgmarketwatch,2xg84x,ReverseLBlock,3,Sat Feb 28 12:26:52 2015 UTC,"I think it depends how long you want to wait. I think it's pretty high atm for what the card is, but on the very long run (4+ years) it might go up to a bit more than what it sits at currently."
mtgmarketwatch,2xg84x,mr_tolkien,1 point,Sat Feb 28 13:47:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks. Yeah, I mean, I do ultimately want a copy or two of this foil. My thinking is just, if this is going to end up dropping from 80ish to 40 or 50ish while it's in print, I could sell now and buy two when that happens"
mtgmarketwatch,2xg84x,EricTheYellow,1 point,Sat Feb 28 16:04:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, right now that's kinda where I'm at on it. I felt differently at first, when I was still coming down from the misinformation at my LGS that it was going for $100+."
mtgmarketwatch,2xg84x,X87x,3,Sat Feb 28 20:23:49 2015 UTC,"Keep.  Yours is pack fresh.  It's a pain in the ass buying foils later on.  They are almost always scuffed and cloudy, yet people still advertise them as NM/M.  Not worth the few bucks you might save, imo."
mtgmarketwatch,2xg84x,CigarPete,2,Sat Feb 28 21:09:24 2015 UTC,Ugh. Too real. You sold me.
mtgmarketwatch,2xg84x,neonend,2,Sat Mar 7 06:35:43 2015 UTC,Long term the foil will be looking really good.  I honestly doubt the foil will go down much unless a duel deck printing occurs (which I highly doubt).  Even out of rotation this card is awesome for EDH and casuals.  Everyone at my LGS wants one to put into there favourite EDH deck.
mtgmarketwatch,2xg84x,milzz,1 point,Sun Mar 8 05:02:15 2015 UTC,That depends. Are we getting a new Nicol Bolas planeswalker card in this set? I think a Nicol Bolas/Ugin duel deck would be awesome.
mtgmarketwatch,2xg84x,neonend,2,Sun Mar 1 08:47:18 2015 UTC,The thing to remember is it's a colorless Planeswalker. It'll always hold it's value. It'll only go up from where it's at now.
mtgmarketwatch,2xg84x,milzz,1 point,Wed Mar 4 14:39:40 2015 UTC,Unless there's a reprint of Ugin. What if they release an Ugin vs Nicol Bolas duel deck? Then the price is likely to drop.
mtgmarketwatch,2xg84x,neonend,1 point,Sun Mar 1 18:42:15 2015 UTC,Reprints don't always constitute a price drop.
mtgmarketwatch,2xg84x,milzz,1 point,Wed Mar 4 17:17:04 2015 UTC,I'm new to MTG speculation. Can you please explain why that is?
mtgmarketwatch,2xh21n,Carnilawl,3,Sat Feb 28 16:57:46 2015 UTC,"It's just a hard to find card that WotC hasn't managed to really reprint. There is the judge foil, which seems likely to go up given it's only 30% more expensive."
mtgmarketwatch,2xh21n,mtd14,2,Sat Feb 28 17:15:52 2015 UTC,"Bingo. It's only going to keep rising each year it doesn't see a reprint in a supplemental product, since it's mechanic precludes a standard-legal printing."
mtgmarketwatch,2xccdf,throwaya1234,6,Fri Feb 27 11:29:20 2015 UTC,Is there actually any advantage of this vs twin as opposed to illness in the ranks?  Also vs infect you may very well be dead by turn 4
mtgmarketwatch,2xccdf,GnomGnomGnom,1 point,Fri Feb 27 14:53:57 2015 UTC,"It kills snapcasters and vendillion clique, and obiviously having the added effect of stopping the combo.  If you can get it out before infect kills you, it is obviously a good place to be.  Kills lingering souls which sorta sucks if you are running them yourself.   Kills dark confidant.  Kills Grim Lavamancer  Stops almost all tokens decks.  Screws up elves and sometimes merfolk if theyre a little slow."
mtgmarketwatch,2xccdf,TheSilent006,3,Sun Jun 21 02:55:43 2015 UTC,[[Illness in the ranks]] is an enchantment that costs a single mana and blanks both pestermites and deceiver exarchs as far as the splinter twin combo goes.
mtgmarketwatch,2xccdf,ChargingrhinosMTG,3,Fri Feb 27 15:41:03 2015 UTC,You are right I am wrong
mtgmarketwatch,2xccdf,drspock4ever,3,Fri Feb 27 15:55:06 2015 UTC,It's an incredible sideboard card against Twin and Lingering Souls. [[Night of Souls' Betrayal]]
mtgmarketwatch,2xccdf,jambarama,4,Fri Feb 27 16:11:10 2015 UTC,"It isn't any better than Illness in the Ranks against those decks.  Only thing I can think of is to combat infect, and it seems slow against infect."
mtgmarketwatch,2xccdf,jambarama,1 point,Fri Feb 27 11:41:15 2015 UTC,"How do you get [[Night of Souls' Betrayal]] out earlier than [[Illness in the Ranks]]?  Illness isn't an instant, it is also an enchantment."

mtgmarketwatch,2xccdf,KidJustice,2,Fri Feb 27 16:11:04 2015 UTC,I know the Japanese were using Curse of Death's Hold instead of this. It's a turn slower but better if you have creatures yourself.
mtgmarketwatch,2xccdf,goldenCapitalist,1 point,Fri Feb 27 11:46:42 2015 UTC,"I think I saw this card come up in a recent finance article (that I cannot remember the name of right now). I hadn't known this card had existed prior to this mention in the article, so it may just be the case that people like me, who hadn't heard of the card before, like it for whatever reason (flavor, casual decks, etc) and now are trying to get some."

I saw it here http://www.mtgtop8.com/event?e=8919&d=250890&f=MO  Also bought 8 and two foils thinking was going to spike...
mtgmarketwatch,2x8ufs,Branch3s,3,Thu Feb 26 16:27:40 2015 UTC,"As long as red-based aggro is top-tier, Outpost Siege is going to be in demand. If you're not running at least two, you're doing something wrong."
mtgmarketwatch,2x8ufs,gamblekat,2,Thu Feb 26 16:34:37 2015 UTC,"I'd definitely wait on selling, if you look at the modo price trend you can see that the paper trend is following pretty closely just a week or so behind.  I don't see the card dropping in price anytime soon with the amount of play it's seeing."
mtgmarketwatch,2x8ufs,jshed2,1 point,Thu Feb 26 23:31:47 2015 UTC,"Holy crap, when did that become a 6 tix card? I think we're in for a wild ride on this one side the demand is real"
mtgmarketwatch,2x8ufs,nookularboy,2,Fri Feb 27 03:43:28 2015 UTC,It is worth noting that the foil is at a 4x multiplier which shows demand in other formats (EDH at the very least). I don't see this coming down anytime soon.
mtgmarketwatch,2x8ufs,Trainer_PAC,1 point,Fri Feb 27 01:32:13 2015 UTC,Foil is at a 4x multiplier mostly because of the watermark.
mtgmarketwatch,2x8ufs,Notalec,2,Fri Feb 27 01:36:56 2015 UTC,That watermark makes the card crazy bendy. I had to tell a player last weekend that he couldn't play his set of foil Frontier Sieges because I could tell when they were on the top of his deck.
mtgmarketwatch,2x8ufs,liucoke,1 point,Fri Feb 27 04:57:27 2015 UTC,"Yes, I noticed this.  I have several unplayed foils of this card and they are extremely curved."
mtgmarketwatch,2x8ufs,Demilio55,1 point,Sun Mar 1 13:01:48 2015 UTC,"I think there will be growth until Dragons, then it could stabilize or keep going depending on what Red-based agro toys are released.   I was expecting around $3, but we seemed to have broken that. I got around 32 for 0.7 each.  EDIT: It is also worth noting that RDW type decks are playing some copies of Outpost Siege. If that catches on, then we'll definitely see a continued increase in price as it's a popular deck archetype."

mtgmarketwatch,2x9c3m,Red_Beam,17,Thu Feb 26 18:35:08 2015 UTC,"When the card arrives, check it out. If it is a fake, you can open a case with Ebay stating that the card is counterfeit. You'll likely need to include some evidence as to why it is fake (i.e. photos), but Ebay is pretty good about protecting buyers from counterfeits. Also, the other feedback stating the card was ""fake"" may or may not be true, so don't worry about that at this point. Once the card arrives, you can make your decision."
mtgmarketwatch,2x9c3m,IgoRStripes,3,Thu Feb 26 18:53:10 2015 UTC,Yes. Do this.
mtgmarketwatch,2x9c3m,bunbunfriedrice,3,Thu Feb 26 19:41:51 2015 UTC,"The good news is that eBay almost always sides with the buyer, as long as you are willing to go through the process.   You should know as soon as you touch the card if it's real or not (I once bought a collection that contained three different generations of Chinese forgeries, they all felt weird to the touch, in one way or another).  If you don't think its real, contact the buyer for a refund. If necessary, open a case with eBay. Odds are heavily in favor of you getting your money back, one way or another."
mtgmarketwatch,2x9c3m,SaffronOlive,2,Thu Feb 26 20:25:53 2015 UTC,"I would contact ebay support and see if the protection plan they have can refund your money. You enter a contract when you purchase something so you need to pay for it. Then, assuming the card is fake, you can file a claim and try to have it refunded."
mtgmarketwatch,2x9c3m,Dima420,2,Thu Feb 26 18:50:52 2015 UTC,"What others are saying is helpful but you should know that if you paid with VISA (or any credit card I think) the rules for reimbursement are different.  So even if Ebay sides with the seller you may still be open to other avenues.  This happened to me due to non arrival of a package (different issue) but tracking numbers were provided and the thing still said in transit (it got sent back and then sent out again) so ebay didn't want to do anything.  I was worried about time (hitting the 90 day mark) and found out VISA has a 120 day for items not arriving.  Regardless:  1) Wait for arrival and make sure it's fake.  Video tape opening the package from start to finish without the card ever leaving frame.  2) If card is fake, open case with ebay.  Provide video above with explanation of why it's fake.  3) If ebay falls through (unlikely by this point), check what options you may have through Credit Card company (if you paid this way)."

Most people wouldn't call it a buyout- they'd call it a ""market correction.""  From my perspective, the target matters. If you wanna get really Illuminati about it, maybe the high profile ""bad"" speculations happen so often just to shift focus away from the ""real"" price movements."
mtgmarketwatch,2wza6g,Encendi,2,Tue Feb 24 13:45:04 2015 UTC,I think the difference between Ruinator and Rhino is demand. I know people who were actually selling foil Rhinos for $35 or $40. I don't know anyone that moved a Ruinator post-spike.
mtgmarketwatch,2wza6g,stitches_extra,1 point,Tue Feb 24 13:49:25 2015 UTC,"Right, but I think fundamentally they are the same thing. The supply of foil Siege Rhinos didn't change at all and I doubt the demand really changed either (maybe another 20 people wanted a set of foil Rhinos post Pro Tour, and I think that's even pushing it).  I just think the MTG community in general can convince themselves of price spikes when they look reasonable enough (e.g. if you were convinced shocks were gonna rise post rotation, like most players are, then when they rise you accept it). Additionally, prices are pretty elastic in the sense that if you're already pimping your deck, it doesn't matter whether it costs $500 or $600.  If everyone agrees with a delusion, then the delusion can become reality. That's what I'm trying to say."

mtgmarketwatch,2wza6g,jjness,2,Tue Feb 24 22:22:45 2015 UTC,"I learned something about potatoes.  Buyouts around the Protour I think are more common because there is more secrecy to what the players are running (See this year's Magus of the Baazar, Séance, etc). When everyone isn't as trigger happy it seems easier to pick out what spikes are legitimate and which are artificial.  But this isn't my job, so that's my 2 cents."

mtgmarketwatch,2wyq0u,Chosler88,4,Tue Feb 24 06:26:23 2015 UTC,"I think a very good analogy is piracy and the effect it had on the DVD and CD industry. I agree with most of your points but you are not bringing any solution other then saying burn the fakes you spot. The truth is, like piracy, most people don't care it's ethically wrong to ""proxy"" your cubecards/kitchentable deck (and in my country it's certainly not illegal to buy and use it, selling/trading however is). My point being is that the masses don't care about WotC/LGS/Investors wallets when counterfeits are nearly indistinguishable from the real thing.  Also I don't think counterfeits are that big of a threat to WotC then you seem to suggest. The biggest revenue comes from selling standard displays/packs. And the counterfeit cards will be mostly older cards where big gains are to be made.   So is there a real solution to the problem? Yes, reprinting stuff to make the counterfeit business less profitable. I think this is the only long-term solution.   Rereading my post it seems I'm actually advocating and supporting this whole counterfeit business but I'm certainly not. I really hope counterfeits won't increase in quality in the near future but it's certainly holding me back investing into expensive cards."
mtgmarketwatch,2wyq0u,RudelyOutOfContext,1 point,Tue Feb 24 12:12:46 2015 UTC,"The biggest revenue comes from selling standard displays/packs. And the counterfeit cards will be mostly older cards where big gains are to be made.    This is only true when they consistently print newer cards. You can tell the m series have lower sales than the other sets because they keep reprinting cards from previous m sets. Eventually, players will find sets having almost no value because every card they have is either better or is reprinted. One way to tackle this is to power creep the cards which is exactly what wotc has been doing. If they don't, they will lose sales. So if someone counterfeits cards, and it so happens to be reprinted, wotc will lose some sale on those sealed products."
mtgmarketwatch,2wyq0u,GosuMagic,3,Wed Feb 25 15:10:50 2015 UTC,"Interesting article.   I think the analogy to the music industry is an apt comparison. The problems facing the music industry in the early 2000s were two-fold. You had consumers who wanted the product, but they wanted to consume and carry it in a digital, easily portable manner. On the other side was an industry full of companies who refused to admit that the CD was not the final answer to how people consumed music. Add in the increasing power of personal computers to extract music from those CDs and the growing ability of those files to be shared over the internet.   What happened was that people went to the available marketplace for digital music, the pirates. There was no legitimate marketplace for digital music and the record companies tried for years to prevent one being created. Now that one exists where people can get easy and reasonably priced access to the music they want, how much do you hear about piracy other than the occasional ad?  I think this is something that WotC should be taking a very hard look at in terms of their business model and their marketing strategy. People want these cards and will buy them where possible and where prices are most reasonable.   There are certainly people who will resist using or purchasing counterfeit cards for a lot of the reasons you mention and I have seen elsewhere. But with the prices where they are and the current availability of cards, this looks like a repeat of the music scenario. A company or industry can fight piracy when only a few people are involved. The problem comes when your entire customer base turns to piracy because the product they want is not available to them.  It may be that WotC have strategies to deal with this, but the road they are on looks like it will lead to one of two places. Either counterfeits eventually become widespread and Corbin's worst case scenario comes to pass, or they make these cards available again. While the reserved list had it's place when it came out, and was  instrumental in preserving Magic as a community, I think it's time has passed and I hope that WotC will act before it is too late."
mtgmarketwatch,2wyq0u,CigarPete,3,Tue Feb 24 17:53:27 2015 UTC,I'm surprised people disagree with you as I think you were pretty conservative with your predictions.   I don't own any duel lands but I still have a collection worth around 5k and that's just the rares/mythics. That would take a serious hit and just like a store suddenly your inventory would halve (or worse).   Drafting wouldn't have the same allure when what you open and win is likely worth less than one packs retail price.   A lot of people would feel burnt and people are underestimating the importance of the collection aspect of the game. I think it might be like WOW giving everyone max level characters in all classes. It would be cool for a bit but also a little hollow.   I am a player and see it as a game first but I am not blind enough to see that the collectable aspect is very important. I see people buying packs from my LGS at retail just to crack. That would be a thing of the past.
mtgmarketwatch,2wyq0u,Theangryhermit,2,Wed Feb 25 02:10:09 2015 UTC,"My repost from mtgfinance   My two cents for the argument about gaining access to better cards should be accessible to everyone just does not hold water.  I want a Lamborghini, but who am I to demand that just because I want to race with it in a tournament that it should be cheaper? It really is the way of the world, its not rocket science. You are either born privileged where you don't need to worry about it, or you need to earn it. Same goes for everything. I want Goyfs, I can't afford them, who am I to demand them affordable just so I can play with them. A sharpied card or even printed paper should be enough until I can earn the real thing. I feel this argument is for people who want everything given to them or feel entitled just because they play the game.  For people saying it's not a finance problem, the game itself is financial and anything effecting buying and selling should be part of it. The article lays out long term worst case scenarios. Why bother printing at all if its just accessible from a cheaper printer? It seems entirely plausible that it could eventually shut down the game. Is no one looking at their older cards differently or even questioning what could happen, or even what they should do as this gets worse?   Am I right? Probably not, but morally, that's just how I feel, and financially, my mindset has been changing."
mtgmarketwatch,2wyq0u,earthbinder,3,Thu Feb 26 21:00:07 2015 UTC,"Reposting my response from /r/MTGFinance -  So, I get that you are making a moral argument against counterfeits, and that's a solid issue to write about. But the moral implications of the MTG counterfeit business has nothing to do with MTGFinance. You even make a point to not link to the counterfeiters site, nor the legion of youtube videos depicting the quality of the cards, and the most common ways to spot the last few generations of fakes. So I ask myself why Corbin hasn't just posted this to /r/magicTCG... oh wait you already did. And /r/mtgmarketwatch. Despite the fact that there's not a shred of finance in the article beyond ""counterfeits could kill magic in the long run"". If you had gone to the effort of providing any information that helps spot fakes, then the argument could be made for relevancy in mtgfinance or mtgmarketwatch.  TL;DR - There's nothing wrong with the article, but in the realm of MTGFinance, this is spam."
mtgmarketwatch,2wyq0u,Rock-swarm,3,Tue Feb 24 06:42:12 2015 UTC,"I think this is very relevant for magic investors. Some people seem to think counterfeits would only tank the price for cards worth over $100, but once they get the formula right the price of all cards will plummet. Every investment will turn into a bad one. I think there is a high risk that we'll see good counterfeits within the next three years, and therefor I would be skeptical toward most long term Magic investments."

mtgmarketwatch,2wyq0u,Morzas,-3,Tue Feb 24 07:10:28 2015 UTC,You didn't once mention the actual problem: the Reserve List. You're blaming the wrong people here.
mtgmarketwatch,2wyq0u,Rock-swarm,3,Tue Feb 24 09:19:33 2015 UTC,"I think (and this is my personal opinion only) WoTC has already cast their lot in this. They doubled down on the Reserved List a few years ago and created Modern, a format where they can and will reprint everything liberally. For whatever reason (legal, moral, otherwise) the Reserved List isn't going anywhere, and that means Legacy can never be the format of the masses. So WoTC created Modern, something they hope can be that. Blaming WoTC for a decision made 15 years ago that A) played a part in the game not collapsing after the Chronicles debacle, and B) was not a decision made by anyone currently working there is just wasted breath. Seriously, we all hate the Reserved List. But no one ever considers that if they didn't do that it's a possibility that Magic wouldn't even exist today.  But off that tangent, the problem is this: if this attitude of ""counterfeits are okay if they're on the Reserved List,"" becomes prevalent you've already undermined the market in a way that cannot be undone. If the Reserved List is okay to cheat on, then is Goyf next? Dark Confidant? Cryptic Command? Grove of the Burnwillows? Pact of Negation? Spellskite? Shocklands? Fetchlands? Serum Visions?  It's either okay or it's not. You can't make arbitrary distinctions of when it is and isn't okay to support criminals.  The counterfeits have and will continue to get better, though hopefully still be distinguishable by experts. But it doesn't matter how good they are if the vast majority of the community decides to do the right thing instead of the cheap thing."
mtgmarketwatch,2wyq0u,ray_area,-2,Tue Feb 24 09:22:30 2015 UTC,"Two questions for you.  1) How many players have been caught using counterfeit cards in a competitive-REL tournament this year? This isn't a rhetorical question.  2) in your opinion, what percentage of counterfeit buyers are seeking to make money off their counterfeits, as opposed to using them for play purposes?  I grant the point that counterfeits are a net loss for MTG in the long-term. However, this is a problem entirely created from WotC's business policies."
mtgmarketwatch,2wyq0u,bathroomjesus,3,Tue Feb 24 11:15:44 2015 UTC,It will be hard to convince WOTC that their business practices are the cause of counterfeiters when these same policies have allowed it to continue to stay in business.

It's also great for protecting your key pieces vs. something like Junk or UWR. Honestly, it's one of the best positioned cards in the meta right now. Very few of my modern decks don't have at least a pair in the SB.  EDIT: You're going to probably want to move out of these at some point before MMA2, since you have to imagine the odds of it turning up in there are solid, but it's near ubiquitous SB status means most competitive players will not be willing to do so.

It's the 3rd most popular constructed format behind Standard and Modern.   Why? Because it's cheap (for now).  Low CC cards are generally cheap and because it's 50 card singleton rather than 100 card singleton, Tiny Leaders doesn't punish mono coloured decks. In a 100 card singleton mono colour deck, it's very hard to streamline a deck well with high quality cards. In tiny leaders this is very easy to do because it's just 50 cards out of which 18-20 are lands. It's not difficult to fill 30 deck slots with strong and efficient format staples.  Mono colour equals extremely cheap decks. As an eternal format, this is the cheapest. The format is also extremely competitive and very fun. You could consider it legacy light."

I know that SolipsisticEgoKing doesn't have a lot of context about my personal situation (finances, frequency of purchase, etc.), but I think of it more as a treat than an attempt to get rich.  A closer comparison I think would be buying a milkshake, or getting toppings on pizza. Neither of these are necessary for a person's well-being, and there is a loss in EV compared to many alternatives. However, we splurge on things that make us happy from time-to-time."

They would buy boxes or cases and if they don't pull enough to buylist more than they bought it for, they would double down and get another hoping the second will pay for itself and the first.  A single pack every now and then is more like a milkshake or going out to eat.

For example I pulled about $275 of value out of two khans of tarkir boxes at the time of the set release (the value was probably padded by pulling 9 fetches between the boxes as well which was pretty lucky), but now that value would be worth maybe half of what it was then. And even still, I didn't get $275 cash out of it, I just got card value. I was able to trade into some good staples for the format and was set for a lot of my standard needs, but I didn't actually ""make money"" and I would consider this a near best case scenario for opening packs."

Since then, I've always enjoyed the feelings of opening packs, and I buy the occasional from Target.

mtgmarketwatch,2wpfj1,_sonic_,1 point,Sat Feb 21 23:31:37 2015 UTC,"I agree with so much of what you said, but i do want to note that through a combination of having that dated templating you mentioned, and being very powerful in Modern, its actually more likely to be reprinted than, say duplicated and corrected. I'm tempted to say that even a card with identical stats, fixed ""greater than your starting total"" templating, but a p/t boost that is only +3/+3 is still unlikely because it will create this glut of functionally identical cards (a la soul sisters). My overall point is that its power is known, its value reflects that, and the healthiest choice wotc can make is to reprint it rather than ignore or correct it."
mtgmarketwatch,2wpfj1,thelehn,0,Sun Feb 22 00:17:43 2015 UTC,that's not a reason not to reprint. There are plenty of newer cards that have been reworded.
mtgmarketwatch,2wpfj1,GosuMagic,1 point,Sun Feb 22 03:25:11 2015 UTC,"The only place I can see it being reprinted before next year is Magic Origins, since OG characters like Serra could get named cards if those are the ""origins"" they speak of (my guess is that they tell a prequelesque tale/s of our current planeswalker protagonists), but a core set is a core set and serra's ascendant could return regardless (it debuted in M11, right after New Phyrexia). I do believe its increased rise over run correlates with the Tiny Leaders buzz, which is effectively right after the FRF release icon on MTGGoldfish. Will WotC reprint Ascendant? Eventually, but i bet not in Commander decks. I dont see wizards encouraging t1 6/6 flying lifelink beaters.  [edit] It could be in MM15 because it came out before New Phyrexia. Set foils, even core set foils, seem like a solid hold, but check up on the changes for reprints in MM for similar examples"

After they are printed, they will go up until they are reprinted again (which may not even happen). I think that they will be a successful long-term investment, and as a somewhat competitive player myself, I can say that shocks are probably the best mana base you can get."
mtgmarketwatch,2wokfz,hcybay,1 point,Tue Feb 24 06:57:53 2015 UTC,Longer term is probably. The short term is unlikely. Barring a sudden and dramatic increase in demand there is too much supply for them to start climbing. MMA2 won't flood the market with new modern players anymore than cheaper fetches from Khans have. There were a lot of newer players who got burned by the bannings so that may also slow people going after full sets of shocks and fetches.

We even just had a Modern PT, and only Steam Vents is doing well. Usually when Modern is the PT format we see a spike in top performing cards/decks and we did see some... Just not in shocks.

mtgmarketwatch,2wjcvt,davekayaus,2,Fri Feb 20 17:15:45 2015 UTC,"The trend I've noticed with duel decks is that its usually the main planeswalker of the block vs another walker from the block.   Sarkhan is the main planeswalker for Khans and he will be dueling someone else on the plane. I highly suspect it will be a walker from Dragons of Tarkir, because Sarkhan vs Ugin doesn't seem likely.   If we see a Nicol Bolas in Dragons of Tarkir, then I would be a little weary on picking up Ugins, as they might do a duel deck. This is my opinion and views on this. Wizards has been following this trend for a while, so I'd be surprised if they changed it up."
mtgmarketwatch,2wjcvt,JakeTheSheepy,2,Fri Feb 20 19:51:28 2015 UTC,"Look at it this way: unless they change how Duel Decks are released, the first opportunity for Ugin to feature in one is March 2016.

mtgmarketwatch,2wjcvt,Yagoua81,1 point,Fri Feb 20 17:40:25 2015 UTC,"It seems the most likely but it really depends on who they print in Dragons of Tarkir. We're probably going to get 2 planeswalkers. My guesses are:   Narset, as she was teased to have a spark in the previous timeline, a knack for reading, and we already know about hidden books Bolas. Dragons of Tarkir is going to need some plot/main fight, and while it's possible that they'll just show us what happened after the 1200 years, I think it's more likely we'll get some closure in Bolas coming to attempt to finish the job.   If this is true I think the best options are:   Narset vs Sarkhan - both from the same world, both with a spark. Some kind of comic-style misunderstanding? Narset vs Sorin - events will be different this time. Sorin won't have found a pile of bones, but what will he find? Who will he fight through? Sorin vs Sarkhan - another thing Sorin might find before Ugin. Ugin vs Bolas - the epic showdown! This would easily be the best release but Ugin and Bolas are both high-profile cards (albeit we don't know what the new Bolas would be like- probably as different from the original as possible meaning he won't mirror Ugin as much). We've already seen a promo Ugin so...I don't know."

mtgmarketwatch,2wjhcp,Chosler88,8,Fri Feb 20 16:41:56 2015 UTC,"Counterfeits are not reprints. If you support counterfeit cards being passed as real ones, you are supporting criminals.  There's really no middle ground to this. People buy these with the intention of using them rather than buy real cards. Sure, the guy wanting them ""for his cube"" may not think he's doing anything wrong, but it all adds up to undermine confidence in the market and in the game. Those are not good things for anyone who claims to be a Magic player. If you want to proxy a card there's no reason to pay for it at all, sharpie on a basic land. If you want to pass off fake cards as real, you buy counterfeits, and that's a problem.  It really doesn't matter if you just want to cube and it sucks that cards are expensive. You are supporting illegal activity by buying these with the intention of playing them."
mtgmarketwatch,2wjhcp,bathroomjesus,0,Fri Feb 20 20:18:26 2015 UTC,"Counterfeits are not reprints.   Only on a technicality, once they can pass detection they are essentially reprints.  You act like legacy should just go ahead and die, those of us who actually play legacy would like to see more players and more tournaments for the best format in the game.  Reprints/proxies/counterfiets whatever you want to call them enable that so why lose any sleep over it? Unless you've been hording duals and you're about to get burned, but hoarders generally deserve whatever bad happens to them."
mtgmarketwatch,2wjhcp,Chosler88,1 point,Sun Feb 22 00:49:33 2015 UTC,"Counterfeits don't create more tournaments. More counterfeits means less money in the game and less incentive for SCG to run events. You'll see the death of legacy, not its salvation."
mtgmarketwatch,2wjhcp,bathroomjesus,0,Sun Feb 22 10:51:27 2015 UTC,"Counterfeits certainly do create more local tournaments, more people have decks and want to play. Counterfeits don't take money away from the game, since if you're priced out of legacy you aren't spending ANY money on legacy cards, they might even increase the amount of money (who buys counterfeit dark rituals? brainstorm?). SCG will be able to sell the same amount of cards, just some cards will go for less and some will go for more. It's like you don't even understand fundamental economics, pick up a book kiddo."
mtgmarketwatch,2wjhcp,Chosler88,0,Mon Feb 23 13:53:08 2015 UTC,"Since you referenced books, how about the internet version? It's called Wikipedia, and a quick look at it (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterfeit_consumer_goods, for your reference) details the huge economic hit to businesses as a result of counterfeiting, or as the US Attorney General puts it, ""... The theft of ideas and the sale of counterfeit goods threaten economic opportunities and financial stability, suppress innovation and destroy jobs.”  But sure, let's look at it in Magic in particular.   Suppose counterfeits were ""accepted"" for local tournaments the way you postulate. If that's the case, why the hell should I buy cards from Wizards or my LGS when I can get an entire set from China for 20 bucks? So many people (maybe not all, since some people want to be altruistic here) begin getting their cards from China.  But WOTC feels it in their pocketbook. New sets aren't selling as well, and cases aren't moving even though the same number of people are playing the game. But those people are buying counterfeits from China instead of from WOTC or their LGS.  So WOTC decides it has to pull back on its expenditures. Out goes the Magic film. Out goes the fourth Pro Tour (this is what happened the last time Magic performed poorly for several years). Out goes Modern Masters 3.  And the LGS, which (I can say from personal experience) does a lot of its Magic-related business from singles. Selling boxes doesn't have great margins, and running FNM doesn't keep the lights on. But now the singles are sitting in the case unused because people are getting cards from China, even if as many or even more players are now playing at the shop.  So the LGS decides to pull back. The space reserved for Casual Commander on Saturdays? Gone, since that table space needs to go elsewhere. The PPTQ the store was thinking about hiring an L2 to run to get some traffic in the store? No longer profitable since the singles business has disappeared to China.  So Magic becomes less and less of a priority at the LGS. And WOTC has to find waves to spend less since revenue is down. And SCG can no longer sell any of the duals they pay such high prices for, so that sucks, and begins to eat into their bottom line. SCG makes their money at Opens buying and selling cards, not running the tournament, which is a break-even proposition at best.  So now everyone is getting cards from China, and SCG is stuck with all these duals. Since no one is buying from SCG and no one is buying on TCGPlayer because they're so much cheaper from China, prices begin to tank. In fact, they plummet. This is extremely debilitating for those who make their living buying and selling Magic cards, SCG included.  Profits tank. SCG can see a day when Opens are no longer profitable. Prize support has to go down to compensate, even though you can be sure entry fees won't change.   All of these things create a vicious circle that suck profits out of the game, and businesses have to make decisions based on those profits. WOTC, SCG and the LGS all make less and less money from Magic, even if the number of players is the same. Sooner or later, there's a breaking point; Magic is a shell of what it once was when the money was flowing to the right people instead of China.   Here's the thing about everything I described above: it's all happened before. This is the observed effect of counterfeits on markets, and none of this is conjecture; it's history.  But hey dude, you saved a bunch of money on those dual lands, so no harm done, right?"

The theft of ideas and the sale of counterfeit goods threaten economic opportunities and financial stability, suppress innovation and destroy jobs.”   You don't understand Wizards business model, your premise is incredibly fallacious.   Wizards sells packs, people buy packs to get cards that Wizards is CURRENTLY (I know reading isn't your strong suit, use a dictionary for some of the larger words) producing.   Wizards isn't currently producing expensive legacy/modern staples (MM is a special case and is irrelevant in terms of this broad analysis) .   The people who profit off of these staples are large card buyers/sellers (SCG, TCG, CF although for legacy it is primarily SCG).  The cost of legacy and the ease of reprinting is leaving a large amount of money on the table and incentivizing unlicensed printings of expensive cards.   The market for unlicensed printings in largely restricted to expensive staples, no one is buying counterfeit brainstorm/DRS/path to exile.  As we saw with MM1 the increase in players for a format that is seeing reprints of money cards can outweigh the increased supply of the cards with respect to price, and the price of all affiliated cards is driven up.   With the ease of access to big ticket items like duals, candelabra, and tabernacle, offered by unlicensed reprints, the prices of other legacy cards will increase and offset the minimal loss of value on the reprinted cards.   tl;dr The market for legacy will grow and offset the downsides of losses on a small fraction of cards. This helps LGS's, SCG, and the game in general."

Some people will auto downvote a link in this sub, but usually those 3-5 downvotes don't do much or hinder conversation.  For the article series, what I think would make it successful is if its an honest weekly update on what they acquire and what they sold/traded away. I think it is important because it gives people a better picture of why someone is mentioning a card - are they holding it or is it just something they think noteworthy? Sure people can lie about what they're buying, but they're probably also aware that if they get caught that's the end of people trusting them.  I've been considering trying a weekly thread for exactly this idea so even us schmucks can let people know what we're thinking, and less active users will have the ability to background check claims by more talkative users.  In regards to the concerns - yes, just by listing cards in a series they are being hyped. However, hopefully people get to the point where they can tell what hype is artificial and what is genuine. Similarly, I think a buyout can be okay, but it really depends on the situation. If there's 4 of a card left on TCG, are you buying them to use or because you know you're driving up the price?

I just didn't want to fall into this stigma of ""just buying and writing about it"" as this sort of underlying motive to ""hype"" cards.

It still has room to grow and with noble/verdant plus expensive sideboards looking like probable reprints the other cards have very good chances of going up.  People want to play green creature decks and this one costs as much as the goyf playset.  It's going to get more popular."

It's like Blue Moon. It's a deck, and it had it's time in the spotlight. I'm not saying Kibler's deck is bad, because it's not. It was made for the PT meta of a field with Abzan at 28% of the meta."

There is no way the other cards in the deck stay the same price.  Modern can support $1000 for a deck like this so there will be good movement in the other cards.    I'd probably still spec into infect or another deck but I think this deck has some promising cards for a post MM2015/post zend fetch world to look out for.

Firstly, it was originally printed in a Commander set and is almost certainly going to be reprinted in an upcoming Commander set. Secondly, is anyone really paying $9 for this card? If it's aimed at your casual EDH player than they can just pick up the arguably better Swiftfoot Boots for $0.60. I am a casual EDH player who has a Champion's Helm and 9/10 I'd rather draw the boots. Or Greaves.  As an aside, I wonder if this makes the Political Puppets deck a good deal.

There could be a few spikes to non foils at $3 to $6 (see Mayael's Aria, Test of Endurance, and Epic Struggle for comparable cards) but will probably sit at $1 to $1.50 for a bit.  So would I horde copies? If you can get them cheap.  Foils are another animal. You can still grab them for about $3 and they could easily go to $5-$10.

Upon further inspection, it looks like a coordinated buyout happened on February 15th. Does anyone know the source of the buyout? My guess is QS but that's just my usual instinct.  Personally, I can't see this maintaining much above $5 foil. This is an absolutely fun effect that I know people love, but the people playing this aren't going out and dropping money on a foil. They're the ones looking for a $2-$4 playset of the card to combine with some other fun cards.   Anyone considering buying, the current going price is around $7.50 so you'll need it to hit $10 to make a quarter on a single copy selling via TCG. If you got in before, I would definitely consider selling at this point."
mtgmarketwatch,2w9wdj,mtd14,1 point,Wed Feb 18 04:57:32 2015 UTC,"Interesting. When I originally started writing this it was only $4. I hadn't checked prices since then. Well...I guess I am too late to the party then. I wanted to post this a few days ago but never got to finish so it was just sitting in a word document.  I'm honestly not sure how well it will do in the long run. That was the reason why I wrote this. To me, this card will always be worth more than it is. And I only picked up one card for myself in case it had gone up in price but that was on Pucatrade about a week ago.  Spikes/buyouts are weird things. Jason once mentioned that even bad spikes go past their old value. I think its hard to determine how high this card goes still. Commander/TL multipliers are interesting and this card is very unique.  A lot of cards end up having 10-15x multipliers if they're popular.   Also about the money thing, sure there probably isn't a lot to be made now, but I doubt many people pay for tracking on sales under $20. I know I never do and this seems like a more long-term hold for me. I just wish I had picked up more."

mtgmarketwatch,2w9wdj,GrossoGGO,1 point,Fri Feb 20 16:40:07 2015 UTC,Why do you believe QS is responsible for the buyout? Do you believe they orchestrate buyouts regularly?
mtgmarketwatch,2w9wdj,X87x,4,Wed Feb 18 13:23:13 2015 UTC,"People on the site regularly buy out cards, or at least buy large quantities of them. Buyouts don't really need to be orchestrated, as a lot of members have access to considerable amounts of capital."
mtgmarketwatch,2w9wdj,GrossoGGO,1 point,Wed Feb 18 15:07:12 2015 UTC,Nowadays it seems like everyone is in on MTG finance. Lots of sites you go to are usually talking about the same card. My experience with QS is that the general discussion on cards is questioning if it's the real deal and how does the short and long term effects are like. Orchestrating buyouts isn't being done among-st members to increase the price.
mtgmarketwatch,2w9wdj,X87x,1 point,Wed Feb 18 16:14:10 2015 UTC,"I made that comment because I think I remember reading that some of the mid-level vendors there buy out cards.    Agreed - there are very, very few original ideas in MTG finance. After all, there are only so many constructed formats, so many 'financiers', and so many cards.   My personal litmus test for deciding if I think a price will stick largely revolves around asking myself the question ""Would I play this card?"". I then consider caveats (I don't play standard, etc) and the decide if I think the price will increase."
mtgmarketwatch,2w9wdj,GrossoGGO,1 point,Wed Feb 18 16:35:25 2015 UTC,"Ahhh gotcha, the buyout word is a sensitive word nowadays. I just hate to see people thinking QS is a location where people conspire to buyouts and forcing higher prices for monetary gain. When it's not like that at all. As much as people want to scapegoat to a specific group of people or ""location"" for the rise in prices, that's not always the answer."
mtgmarketwatch,2w7dnj,ItsDanimal,7,Tue Feb 17 16:23:44 2015 UTC,"Theros cards should have been starting to come out of the trade binder. The buylist on these will start to plummet, if they haven't already. I started unloading things a month or so ago. Again, that's just my habit of doing things."

They are a great finisher, and is generally considered to be better than Sarkhan, especially with RW being on the up trend. Its good in a Mardu deck I like to play, but I know it will be worth nothing after rotation."
mtgmarketwatch,2w7dnj,TheRecovery,2,Tue Feb 17 16:58:36 2015 UTC,It will be worth somewhere around 8.50 post rotation as that's the current price of Thundermaw Hellkite and they are essentially capable of the same exact thing and replace each other in both casual and non-rotating formats.

Stormbreath doesn't swing into path, and also ignores Limgering Souls tokens, so that's a huge plus.

mtgmarketwatch,2w7dnj,KidJustice,2,Tue Feb 17 17:35:27 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say it's false hype though, U/W heroic has been performing decent in the pro scene, and it's a very cheap deck so it makes it popular for FNM players."
mtgmarketwatch,2w7dnj,150crawfish,0,Tue Feb 17 18:08:37 2015 UTC,"Nope, it definitely has the results to back it up, but Hero has already gone from almost bulk status to $5.50.  With 8 months of useful play life left, I unloaded 'em as soon as it hit $4."
mtgmarketwatch,2w7dnj,TehAnon,6,Tue Feb 17 18:21:41 2015 UTC,"Here's what people don't understand when they use the word hype. It's not hype, if there are results. Hype is when someone or something may do well or become popular and everyone bandwagons onto it. Example in LoL. You can't say there is Korean hype anymore. It's just a given that Koreans are the best because their results speak for them.   Hype is when we're talking about the unknown and possibilities/potential. Yes, practically every single card from the deck will start going down in value. However, it's the cheapest competitive deck. Every deck you're playing right now, will most likely also go down in value.   Is it worth it holding onto the deck and keep playing for the next 8 months? Probably considering the deck is so cheap you're not really losing out on that much. And will most likely be able to retain some of the value buylisting it away. Temples will go down, but at $5 ea, they'll probably be like $2-3 lowest around Oct. They'll probably buylist for a buck something. Flooded Strands will still be good and that's a large portion of the deck's cost.  So its really just the Heroes which are $5 cards. Same situation as the Temples but may go down even more. So it buylists for a $1 max or something. So you're losing about $40 value over 8 months. That's not a huge deal considering most of these other decks are costing far more with cards like Temple of malady being at $8, Courser being at like $10,etc."
mtgmarketwatch,2w7dnj,Lachryma_ud,1 point,Tue Feb 17 20:08:03 2015 UTC,"Since the deck itself is so cheap, I can see Hero holding its price much longer.

""Stormbreath could be another card that should start being sold. Its $15 now and should not rise past that. That said, with another set coming out named Dragons of Tarkir, its very possible that some more dragon themed cards get printed making Stormbreath even better. Some examples would be a dragon lord, a card that lets dragon spells cost less, or a global buff for dragons in general."""
mtgmarketwatch,2w7yxi,Silvermagi,5,Tue Feb 17 18:55:14 2015 UTC,"Is Standard driving the price of the card, or is Modern/Legacy?"
mtgmarketwatch,2w7yxi,CorpT,5,Tue Feb 17 18:59:43 2015 UTC,I feel like it is modern and legacy.
mtgmarketwatch,2w7yxi,CorpT,6,Tue Feb 17 19:02:39 2015 UTC,So why would rotation impact the price of it?
mtgmarketwatch,2w7yxi,Manadyne,3,Tue Feb 17 19:05:11 2015 UTC,I feel as though there is still a large body of people who don't play legacy or modern and sell all their standard stuff when it rotates. Creating an influx of supply. This may be wrong
mtgmarketwatch,2w7yxi,jgz84,3,Tue Feb 17 19:08:48 2015 UTC,"No one is playing them in Standard, which is insane because the card is awesome.  The price is entirely from Modern, Legacy, and Vintage play.  Rotation is going to have very little impact on its price."
mtgmarketwatch,2w7yxi,CorpT,2,Tue Feb 17 20:49:35 2015 UTC,It's played in standard in mono red burn. I run it in my side board as a 3 of.
mtgmarketwatch,2w7yxi,Rock-swarm,3,Wed Feb 18 00:20:33 2015 UTC,What % of the meta would you say you are?
mtgmarketwatch,2w7yxi,GosuMagic,1 point,Wed Feb 18 01:11:52 2015 UTC,That's less important than the percentage of the standard playerbase that is literally sitting on a playset until the actual rotation. There are plenty of players that won't pull the trigger on letting their eidolons go until they know they won't have a use for them in standard.
mtgmarketwatch,2w7yxi,GosuMagic,0,Wed Feb 18 20:14:43 2015 UTC,"Players used to rave about Ash zealot in the same way but after Eidolon came out Ash zealot dropped from nearly $2 to .75 cents. So the question is how likely are they going to print a better 2cc staple for red decks? For reference, you should note that similar staples have lost tremendous value once they were cast aside. Examples are Ball Lightning, Jackal Pup and Mogg Fanatic. Also, most of these powerful red cards don't have a place in EDH. Currently it's great in Legacy, Modern and Tiny Leaders (which haven't taken off yet). This is just my analysis but if I were to give you one piece of advice, I'd say don't buy more than a few playsets and monitor every new set that comes out to see if he's getting replaced. Unfortunately, this is a very tedious process in mtgfinance but it's also a very important one."
mtgmarketwatch,2w7yxi,Naltoc,-1,Tue Feb 17 19:51:12 2015 UTC,"I like how passionate you are about Eidolon but going with a gut feeling in mtgfinance can be dangerous. No one knows what Wotc will do and the meta changes from time to time so there might be a time when burn will fall out of favor. I'll stick to buying a few playsets but I wouldn't go really deep into this. Eidolon is not always played as a 4 of and it's often the card players side out. There are plenty of decks that will even play him in the sideboard. I don't feel his power level is as good as you say. If you played in the era when Sligh was dominant, you'd hear the same claims about Jackal pup. We've all noticed how wotc has been pushing the power level of creatures these last few years so I wouldn't be surprised at all if they create a better two drop for red."

Pup was strong since it was the red Savannah Lion ( who was strong then too only because so few 2/1 1-drops existed). Fanatic lost his value with the rules change.   The Eidolon's strength isn't in his body but what he does to game state. The only reason he will be ""less good"" is if modern stops playing so many <3 cost spells."

mtgmarketwatch,2w751t,chrisrazor,6,Tue Feb 17 15:12:20 2015 UTC,I've been picking them up for $2 each. Now is a good time to get in on these deals. It's a good edh card.
mtgmarketwatch,2w751t,GosuMagic,2,Tue Feb 17 15:33:04 2015 UTC,"They're strong with definite Modern, and in the short term Standard, potential and a lot of EDH use.  They are just a step away from being $10 again if the meta shifts that way.  They won't be going any lower, at least, and there will be little or no drop at rotation.  Not a bad buy, not much risk for high reward, but they probably won't go up again for a while, if at all."
mtgmarketwatch,2w751t,Bigbadbear888,2,Wed Feb 18 23:34:04 2015 UTC,"Pod stopped playing Chord ages ago.  Chord sees almost no play in Standard or Modern.  Thus, the $4 price.    You can search for cards being used in decks here: http://www.mtgtop8.com/search"

mtgmarketwatch,2w751t,321orez,2,Tue Feb 17 19:16:06 2015 UTC,"IMO, that's a terrible idea. Its much more likely for the M15 chord to triple from 3 to 10 than a ravnica version to go from 8 to 24. And in the event that it doesn't move at all (they are seeing minimal play right now), you lose a third of the money you would spend on the ravnica version. Ravnica is riskier and with less payout."

mtgmarketwatch,2w50ko,jball_2k,3,Tue Feb 17 05:44:51 2015 UTC,"I think the gods will rise over time, just because EDH and in some cases Tiny Leaders is a format that plays them heavily. For Modern we have Keranos, who sees play as a 1 of in UWR which is not that well positioned right now and some U/R lists. Ashiok is like Gideon-Jura said a good pick up for tiny leaders. But don't pick it up now, pick it up after rotation. Xenagos isn't seeing much play in standard now and i doubt he will ever see play in Modern, especially if Bloodbraid Elf ever gets unbanned. But he still holds casual apeal and EDH of course. Brimaz has good stats, but for modern he doesn't quite do what you want. He doesn't generate value when you play him compared to lingering souls or Liliana if we look at B/W tokens where he would fit in best and in Junk there is Smiter and Kitchen Finks and also Liliana in some cases. He also fights with Monastery Mentor for the same mana spot and that guy is much more likely to make an entrance into modern than brimaz imo. Overall still a good pickup after rotation, since Tiny Leaders is a thing."

mtgmarketwatch,2w50ko,w00tthehuk,7,Tue Feb 17 20:31:47 2015 UTC,"I just want to make sure this is clear, if you're buying any M15/THS block card within the next couple months it's because you believe it's a non-standard playable that will be at it's lowest point before rotation or you have a meta read on an undervalued card going into the PT.  The mtgfinance community has grown/become more knowledgeable over the years and thus speculators are acting quicker on non-standard playables. For instance, the time to pick of Snapcaster Mage was shortly after ISD rotated out but if you had waited on Abrupt Decay to follow the same trend you would've been too late (around this time last year was the best time to pick up Decay). This is definitely something to keep in mind when looking at M15/THS non-standard playables.  I believe this goes without saying, but you shouldn't start picking up THS/M15 stuff right now hoping for standard spikes unless you have a good read on the meta. There will undoubtedly be random spikes amongst cards but as a whole, anything that doesn't see play in Modern, Legacy and etc. will begin it's downward spiral from now until rotation."

mtgmarketwatch,2w4uel,tk_fourtwentyone,4,Mon Feb 16 23:56:48 2015 UTC,"I think this question's answer greatly depends on if, how, and when Zendikar fetchlands are reprinted. For example, if they end up in DTK, there would be less pressure on the Onslaught fetches, possibly decreasing the price. On the other hand, if they aren't there, people who may have been waiting to see if Zen fetches will get reprinted may focus even more on Onslaught fetches."

mtgmarketwatch,2w4uel,GrossoGGO,1 point,Tue Feb 17 17:36:55 2015 UTC,The Khans fetchlands are reprints from Onslaught. The reason it matters about Zendikar (enemy) fetches being reprinted is that they're semi-interchangeable in non-rotating formats.
mtgmarketwatch,2w4uel,321orez,3,Tue Feb 17 20:28:45 2015 UTC,"How long are you going to hold the fetches? If the answer to that question is 'for perpetuity' then saving a few extra bucks now might not make that much difference. If you're looking to pump-n-dump, then now probably isn't that good of a time, as you're looking at a decently long wait until they increase significantly in value. As long as you're not talking about getting your foil fetches the week they are released, there really isn't a single 'best time' to pick them up - they are in relatively large supply (relative to the ONS printings), they are in demand, and they have eternal constructed playability.   In my opinion, where you get your fetches makes a pretty big difference in the price you'll pay for them. Start stocking up on them when you see a good deal."
mtgmarketwatch,2w4uel,KidJustice,1 point,Tue Feb 17 00:02:38 2015 UTC,"I plan on holding them for maybe a year or. Certainly not less than 6 months and certainly not ""for perpetuity"".

Buying at tcg low, depending on the fetch, doesn't seem horrible if you have the extra cash, but you're gonna be sitting for a long while on them, and I don't think they'll be double their current price for some time. I personally am trying my best to stock up on them through trading standard stuff for them, and only occasionally buying one or two.  Also, If you wanna get foil fetches, look toward the ones being  played more in legacy. No one will care much if you have 20 foil Bloodstained Mires. (though I wouldn't pick up none), but 20 Flooded Strand on the other hand...."
mtgmarketwatch,2w4uel,jacksj1,1 point,Tue Feb 17 06:21:45 2015 UTC,Buy cards over $50 on facebook - go to the high end group. You'll pay less than TCGLow most of the time. Some people there try to charge retail or tcglow. They're morons.
mtgmarketwatch,2w3ff3,mtd14,11,Mon Feb 16 17:35:30 2015 UTC,"The FTV print runs have been increasing dramatically every year. You have to go back to 2012 and FTV:Realms before you get many cards worth >$10 (Jace is an obvious outlier in this case). Expect this to be printed near to death and all of the non-constructed playable angels to be near worthless.   I also suspect that between this release and MM2015 virtually all of the re-printable playable angels will be reprinted - Iona was a pretty unlikely inclusion in MM2015 but she almost seems like a shoe-in for FTV:Angels. This also means that the angels from AVR are also likely reprints, with Avacyn representing the most likely reprint.  It is time to trade up, trade out, or sell out of these."

For example, I'm currently holding a set of Restoration Angels on a mini mid/long term spec.  Would a reprint destroy any chance of these continuing to rise in the next year?"
mtgmarketwatch,2w3ff3,Naltoc,1 point,Tue Feb 17 00:55:49 2015 UTC,"Considering the printruns, it would stop the growth dead in its tracks but not more, since lots of people still don't like the foiliing on FTV cards. Only cards it really affects negatively are non-reprinted cards from P3 kingdoms etc."
mtgmarketwatch,2w3ff3,chp129,2,Tue Feb 17 11:56:49 2015 UTC,Pack foils don't usually take much of a hit if any since most people would rather have a pack foil anyways (the foiling process is much better than the ftv one). You might see your 30 dollar mythic angel or 2 from the set drop to 20-23 bucks.   While the print runs get slightly large each year (to compensate for the rapidly growing player base) I don't think it'll be printed out the wazoo like people here and on the other /r seem to think. These are target as limited products not sold in big box stores.

Modern Masters has an ever increasing pool of cards to choose from for reprints and it can't choose everything, so these supplementary products aim to relieve.  Commander 2014 had Wurmcoil Engine in it, and FTV:Angels will likely have Linvala or Iona (probably not both). This suggests to me that Modern Masters 2015 will not have any of these cards.   Other likely targets? Kaalia, Avacyn (Angel of Hope), Platinum Angel, Angel of Fury, Selenia, Radiant Archangel, Akroma (Angel of Fury), Crypt Angel, and Jenara.  I doubt they will reprint Akroma, Angel of Wrath since she was just released in the Anthologies this Christmas."

mtgmarketwatch,2w21je,tehnoodles,6,Mon Feb 16 10:37:12 2015 UTC,"IMO, spending less money on MTG is in some ways better than making money on MTG. It requires a lot less effort from me and I don't loose money on bad specs. I strongly advocate this sort of application of mtgfinance knowledge.   Edit: To expand on this post a bit -   I keep pretty close track of pricing trends so that I can sell multiple cards I'm not using and then use the funds to buy usually a single far more expensive card. The rising tide does lift all boats, but some boats rise sooner than others. Identifying under priced cards and having the cash on hand to take advantage of opportunities when they present themselves is key. Ebay can be a good place to get under priced high end cards, as is the facebook High End group. The weak Euro has also helped in this regard and I have ordered several cards from Europe recently."
mtgmarketwatch,2w21je,GrossoGGO,1 point,Mon Feb 16 16:35:03 2015 UTC,"I completely agree that there are better places and I'm not thinking of doing this for a huge gain, just to pay for playing without digging into my bank account, ya know?  I'm in the process of selling off my old collection. I looked up prices and they seem pretty stagnant, better to sell before they possibly tank. I figured, with the money i make selling these cards, why not keep the money in the same place? Recycle the profits, make the game pay for itself (draft/event fees). Put some of the money into possible winners, and a year/2/3 later have a nice selling point to fund my next round."

mtgmarketwatch,2w0tlt,Bob_The_Skull,7,Mon Feb 16 00:07:13 2015 UTC,"So what I've learned from doing a bit of MTG Finance over the past year or so is that casual long term targets tend to be pretty terrible. I mean, do you know what causes those cards to go up? I don't think it's players. Frankly, most of the reason that any card goes up is mid-sized vendors/speculators buying it up. Your casual spec might be chosen as a target down the line or it might not. My foil Aurelia the Warleaders, Angel of Serenitys, and Trostani are still rotting in my binder and have actually gone down in price. I do agree that at some point in the future it is likely one of them is chosen as a spec target, but I doubt they all will be."
mtgmarketwatch,2w0tlt,Encendi,3,Mon Feb 16 02:20:28 2015 UTC,I agree. There is so much supply for new and shiny EDH cards and more are coming in every set.

mtgmarketwatch,2vspjm,GosuMagic,2,Fri Feb 13 20:19:41 2015 UTC,Temple of the False God has been <$0.50 since the first commander decks were released in 2011. Not sure that a reprint represents any significant value.
mtgmarketwatch,2vspjm,GrossoGGO,2,Sat Feb 14 16:37:11 2015 UTC,I really wish they would just stop and think about what they are reprinting. Look at the original elspeth knight-errant. 4 printing seems excessive. There are plenty of other cards that needs a reprint.

mtgmarketwatch,2vs8rj,celt93,8,Fri Feb 13 17:27:06 2015 UTC,"I think foils are the way to go with the gods, in general. They will be popular EDH generals for a long time to come and foils are far more rare than are non-foils. This effect is magnified by the third-set phenomenon and is reflected particularly, as is eternal playability, in the price of Keranos. Of all of the foil gods, I like foil Purphoros the most. He is an absolute bomb in EDH and many foils of similar stature from older sets are significantly more valuable. Foil Thassa would be a close second, given that she is also a beast in EDH and can be a brutal tiny leader as well. I'd only pick up copies of the potentially playable non-foil gods and not bother getting any copies of the ones that appeal primarily to the casual players.  Edit: spelling"
mtgmarketwatch,2vs8rj,GrossoGGO,2,Fri Feb 13 17:41:22 2015 UTC,"I second thassa. She seems playable across multiple formats. At 3 mana, it could make a splash in modern."

mtgmarketwatch,2vs8rj,Manadyne,5,Fri Feb 13 22:46:14 2015 UTC,"I disagree. First, there are two cycles of gods - a cycle of five mono colored and a cycle of ten two colored gods.

The first three are all either already eternal playable or have very high potential for it, as well as being EDH staples. Kruphix is now not only a staple for any UGx deck, but also an incredibly powerful commander on his own, and he appeals to a very large portion of the EDH base just with his abilities. I plan on stocking up a playset of each foil, and then getting additional nonfoils of the first three."

On top of that, Purphoros has an effect that is very hard to ignore, and same goes for Keranos.

I've started acquiring the cheaper ones (Karametra, Mogis, Ephara) and will snag some of the others at rotation.

mtgmarketwatch,2vqeqs,Rathier,6,Fri Feb 13 05:29:14 2015 UTC,Peak supply for Khans is a ways off. I think the rhino has some room to fall in the short term.

mtgmarketwatch,2vnwbt,mewcuss,25,Thu Feb 12 16:21:04 2015 UTC,"I posted my response in the other reddit, so I will post it here too:  This was originally intended for FB, but felt it more pertinent to post it here. Read the article, also happened to read the reddit post/debate. I don't like getting into all this controversy, and certainly not on Reddit. (I don't really do the Reddit thing.) Just a preference, not downplaying reddit.  I felt compelled to say something so, here it goes:  Let me just make this VERY clear before I say this. Firstly, I enjoy your work, for the most part. Even have you followed on Twitter, and I don't disparage any person or any group of people in the MTGFinance community. I may have when I first entered the scene, but not anymore, and I wouldn't going forward, to anyone. Secondly, I enjoy work on all platforms (MTGprice/QS/BSB) from all writers who write literature on the subject.  This is my only issue and i'll talk great lengths behind it. They're would be a whole lot less controversy if due diligence was made more often, and disclosure. Like, almost painfully thrown into people's faces. That's the lengths that need to be taken by the people who write literature on the subject. It's one thing to say it on some comment somewhere on some random post, than to repeat it numerous times and actually stick by your stance. If due diligence is made, and again very obviously, then it's out of the writers hands if the readership choose to ""buy out"" certain cards they're mentioning. I can't ever determine ulterior motives from anyone, or give in to these weird ""conspiracies"" of things that are done, all I can do is take it face value, and judge on the merit of writers/podcasters ect. just trying to create good content for the community to be ""thought leaders"" and help people be better financiers in this market.  Secondly, we really have to start fading out the ""them"" and ""us"" mentality. I would be lying to everyone to say I haven't made profit, off of a tweet by someone, or a post on reddit (in either sub) that AREN'T the ""thought leaders"" of this community (Corbin Hosler, Jason Alt, James Chillcott, Guo Heng Chin, Brian G Dale ect) just to name a few. They're plenty of people in this very group (FB) that are very helpful and insightful, but don't post articles, and I respect their input as well. The amount of people following this aspect of magic is growing, and we all have to adapt to it. Myself included, as someone who creates content. I'm no exception.  I'd really hate to single you out here Douglas Johnson and use this as an example, but maybe some of the backlash and seemingly more controversial stuff that is coming back around is attributed to ""I say one thing and do another"" view that a lot of the readership is starting to see very plainly. You can't write about someone in your article talking about buying up Vengevine, when you tweet things like: https://twitter.com/Rose0fthorns/status/565580847722795008  I'm sure it's only a joke, and to many people that know you better than I do will know it's a joke, but to readers who read your articles basically ""writing off"" people who made Vengevine posts or try to ""artificially spike"" cards, then tweet that, it seems hypocritical. You even mentioned Seance in your article (good or bad could be viewed as pushing it). Though again, I don't know you, only through your work.  So, there it is, I just wanted that to be out there. Again, I'm not trying to cause drama, I don't have any ill-will to anyone in this community, because I've also done well following and reading work by the people I mentioned before as well. Just some really constructive criticism, I think.  TL;DR Due diligence, full disclosure, no more ""them"" and ""us"" mentality."
mtgmarketwatch,2vnwbt,ChazVMTG,11,Thu Feb 12 16:24:56 2015 UTC,"Likewise, I posted this over there:  Great points. I'm also a little disappointed that there is no mention of how last year's protour/unbanning announcement affected prices just as significantly.  Look at this article from last year: http://brainstormbrewery.com/plant-of-the-gods/  Some excerpts:  ""Deathrite Shaman has been banned, will Vengevine suddenly see play?""  ""Wild Nacatls On the move after being unbanned! Will zoo own the metagame?""  ""Geist of Saint Taft looks to be a player going forward!""  ""Noble Hierarch is going to be White Hot!""  What followed the 2014 protour was an increase on modern cards all across the board. Even Douglas mentioned that Amulet of Vigor spiked to over 7 this same time last year.  Except last year we attributed it to the ""high cost of entry into modern"" or ""I wrote about the Modern format and how its affordability (or lack thereof) is quickly spiraling out of control.""  Or what was said on Feb 13th of last year: ""To say that there has been a cataclysmic shift in the Modern metagame due to the B&R announcements would be an understatement. Modern prices are shooting through the roof as speculation opportunities abound. The pro tour has yet to happen, but players have already begun to make their moves in getting into the archetypes they want to play, or the ones they think will do well.""  The only difference is this year, this year, we have a scapegoat. ""Those plebs over at mtgmarketwatch don't know what they are doing! They are causing volitility int he market that I refuse to believe could be from my own doing, or the pro tour, or the ban/unban announcement! Inferior scum!""  People need to check themselves..."
mtgmarketwatch,2vnwbt,WigginIII,7,Thu Feb 12 17:40:11 2015 UTC,What?  We absolutely had a scapegoat last year.  It was called r/mtgfinance  http://www.reddit.com/r/mtgfinance/comments/20660o/time_to_crack_down/  That was from 11 months ago right after the modern pro tour.  Read it and you don't think mtgmarketwatch is emulating mtgfinance from last year?  You are blind.
mtgmarketwatch,2vnwbt,Rippig,13,Thu Feb 12 22:21:05 2015 UTC,"1,000 subs vs 8,000 subs. You cant seriously think an audience 1/8th the size has the same impact.  Regardless, the ""market"" of information has spoken. Users want a more open forum to place to discuss cards. This is our new reality.  Smart financiers are using it to their advantage. Lesser ones are bitching about it."
mtgmarketwatch,2vnwbt,WigginIII,8,Thu Feb 12 22:28:44 2015 UTC,"I don't think mtgmarketwatch has been responsible for the spikes at all.  I'm just saying mtgfinance was definitely the scapegoat last year and mtgmarketwatch is the scapegoat this year.    I think a lot of the fear is that mtgmarketwatch will turn into what mtgfinance was.  It may be 1000 subscribers right now, but next year?  Who knows.  We have precedent from mtgfinance how shitty that situation was.  If I was a ""smart"" financier (shark), I would be posting on mtgmarketwatch about cards that I was holding hoping they would spike and sell out to lesser fools and that's a problem."
mtgmarketwatch,2vnwbt,Rippig,5,Thu Feb 12 22:33:48 2015 UTC,"and if this sub keeps being reasonable and Ive seen some very thoughtfull comments in this discussion, we will downvote and give good advice if something like this happens."

mtgmarketwatch,2vnwbt,CorpT,10,Thu Feb 12 16:57:34 2015 UTC,"I like to think I have a somewhat unique perspective on this debate, so after mostly avoiding the fray all day, I think it's time to join in.   First off, I guess I am currently a MTG and MTGfinance writer, which I guess makes me one of the bad guys. The thing is, the reason I'm writing on MTGGoldfish today is that I started posting well-received and highly upvoted ""approved submitter"" articles in /r/mtgfinance.   For me, Goldfish provides a lot of tool for article-writing that Reddit doesn't offer. I believe this was Richard's intent in adding articles to Goldfish, to give people who publish solid content more tools to make even better content. I can insert graphs, images, and even videos (although I haven't done this yet) into my articles, which is pretty hard to do in text posts on Reddit. So yes, now instead of ""approved submitter"" posts, my articles show up as links. If you want to downvote on that alone, I guess that's your choice, but this seems a bit hypocritical, because it wasn't that long ago the same content (without all the bells and whistles) from the same author was getting (nearly) universally upvoted.   This brings me to my point. Are there ""elitists"" in MTG Finance. Yes. Are there some writers with abrasive and demeaning attitudes? Yup. Should some of these public figures handle themselves in a more professional manner? Totally. Self-examination is necessary, without a doubt.   At the same time, I think the sub needs to examine their attitudes as well. Should you be downvoting simply because an article is in ""link"" form? I don't believe so. Should you reject good advices/financial wisdom because it comes from a ""site"" rather than a user submitted posts? Probably not. Remember, my personal example. I'm a Redditor who happens to write for a site. Not some elitist jerk, and I'm sure I'm not the only one.  I guess what I'm trying to say is, we call ourselves the ""MTG Finance COMMUNITY,"" but we really aren't acting like one. We need to be inclusive, not only to new players/financiers, but to random people who stop by the sub, or on Twitter. To writers. To /r/marketwatch, /r/mtgfinance, and all the other subs out there.   This attitude of Writers v. Reddit or Audience v. Author is ridiculous and unhealthy from both sides. I might writes for a site, but that doesn't mean shit - I'm not looking to argue from authority. This is why many of my articles focus on data and numbers, so you don't have to take my word for it, you can look at the numbers yourself and come to your own conclusions. At the same time, I want to hear what you have to say, just as much as (I hope) you want to hear my opinions. That's how a community works.   I know this has been going on for a while, at least since the changes in /r/mtgfinance, but if we are going to call ourselves a community, it's time to cut out this infighting and start acting like one."
mtgmarketwatch,2vnwbt,SaffronOlive,8,Fri Feb 13 00:27:23 2015 UTC,"This was a great post.   I do think it's interesting that this can all be traced back to the moderation decision on /r/mtgfinance to move to the ""approved submitter"" system. That created a resentment against those ""approved submitters"" by the rest of the sub. That attitude (with plenty of egging on by some people on the other side) has continued. It's creating a divide where there really shouldn't even be one. I've written finance article for five years straight now, and this attitude has never come up before that mod decision in the other sub led to this current friction.  I don't want to represent something people have to either be ""for"" or ""against."" I just want to continue writing articles and have them be judged by their merit, not where they appear."
mtgmarketwatch,2vnwbt,Chosler88,4,Fri Feb 13 01:12:41 2015 UTC,"I don't want to represent something people have to either be ""for"" or ""against."" I just want to continue writing articles and have them be judged by their merit, not where they appear.  Agree 100%."
mtgmarketwatch,2vnwbt,SaffronOlive,2,Fri Feb 13 02:16:48 2015 UTC,"I've written finance article for five years straight now, and this attitude has never come up before that mod decision in the other sub led to this current friction.   The mod decision was the result of these frictions, although it obviously aggravated them as well. The decision was made because people like Jason and some of the mods there clearly believed that spike posts were on net a harmful force in the community, and they still do. As long as the elites think that a decent share of the discussion that would freely occur should be either banned or at least moved off to the sides to raise the signal:noise ratio of the community, these tensions will exist.  Sometimes communities can tolerate these schisms, where you have a board full of shitposting and then a board dedicated to higher-level discussions (on Reddit, these are most of the ""true_[x]"" subreddits) without mutual animosity developing. The problems with what happened on /r/mtgfinance were twofold:  a) The ""true"" community has to split off from the shitposting community, not try to censor it and cause a split.  b) There has to actually be a good argument that the shitposting is shitposting. Part of why the mtg finance writers are getting flack here is because a lot of their content is not appreciably better than what they'd deride here. The evidence of the harms of spike threads is both selective and anecdotal and no one's going to put forth better arguments because no one's actually going to do the sort of analysis that actual finance experts would do."
mtgmarketwatch,2vnwbt,mtg_liebestod,4,Fri Feb 13 06:39:52 2015 UTC,"I 100% agree that articles are good and especially enjoy the goldfish ones for the graphs and easy switch between online and paper. Although articles do get downvoted quickly here, I feel like it's the vocal few that default downvote all articles. Some even report them, but none of been deleted and I feel they general have good discussion in the comments.   Goldfish is by far my favorite finance site, so thanks for your contributions."
mtgmarketwatch,2vnwbt,mtd14,1 point,Fri Feb 13 02:17:15 2015 UTC,How do you feel about this sub? Do you believe it's currently emulating the mtgfinance sub before stricter moderation was enforced and causing price spikes?
mtgmarketwatch,2vnwbt,Bilb0Bagg1n5,7,Fri Feb 13 01:17:58 2015 UTC,"I reminds me of the old /r/mtgfinance and I think it's generally good that most people have a voice. Whether or not it is causing spikes, I don't know, or particularly care. I've come to grips with spikes - they are going to happen, whether is is from low-supply, coordinated buyouts, articles, or reddit, it really doesn't make a difference. The outcome is the same.   I do believe that most (or all) of the spikes would happen if this sub didn't exist. Between Twitter, others subs, Facebook groups, articles, and everything else, they would happen either way."
mtgmarketwatch,2vnwbt,SaffronOlive,4,Fri Feb 13 02:13:50 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Spikes will happen regardless of this sub, and I'd rather have information about spikes or upcoming spikes available in a single place that is this sub."
mtgmarketwatch,2vnwbt,GHChinMTG,0,Fri Feb 13 03:57:27 2015 UTC,"Actually, imo this place is significantly better than /r/mtgfinance was pre-""reform"".

It's hilariously poor business practice, for obvious reasons, but that all pales in comparison to good ego stroke, amirite?

I'm a little disgusted by it honestly. I mean you're 19 and people expect you to have sort of an entitled/bratty attitude generally speaking, but you're grossly misinterpreting your position (not just you, Jason and Chosler do it to) people aren't really waiting for you to hop along with the latest idea or for you to spoonfeed them, the sub(s) would go one fine without all of you, it's more that people respect(ed) your opinion as a person and by extension, you as a person. It makes you seem like you're trying to take advantage of your readers. Joking about taking advantage of your ""dick-sucking"" idiot readers is a REALLY bad joke to make PR wise.  Maybe that was a mistake, maybe you never wanted respect, but you certainly didn't help gain any readers or respect here, in my case, where I used to be interested in your thoughts sometimes on certain cards/tides of change and would comment on your articles with praise, criticism or different thoughts, I'd rather not any more.   Of course you'll never recant or apologize, because it would put you at a ""lower level"" than your contemporaries in terms of admitting a mistake like that, (despite the fact that they often do worse). But it sucks because you've always had the least cynical and most friendly reading style in your articles, which people otherwise believed.  Man twitter really makes it easy to fk up doesn't it?

mtgmarketwatch,2vnwbt,GrossoGGO,14,Thu Feb 12 22:37:29 2015 UTC,"I don't think this sub is responsible for causing any spikes. The MTG market is pretty small overall, despite what people may think, and there really aren't that many good specs available at any one time. Many of these specs have been blatantly obvious and the mtg community as a whole bought into the specs. This sub is a small part of a much larger community.   Another reason that I don't think this sub has directly caused any spikes is that  I haven't read any truly novel and forward thinking exposition in this sub. This sub isn't causing any spikes because it is always lagging behind them.   What is this sub great for? It is a great place to visit daily to read about movements in the market. $100 Kaalia is a great example. I'll try to sell mine into any hype, but barring that unlikely event I'll hold it for a while longer and sell it for $50 when everything is all said and done. I like the information that this sub has, but again, pretty much everything in this sub is discussed post hoc.   Edit: I just had a thought about why the community of 'financiers' might be so unhappy with this sub: This sub spreads information quickly and the fast dissemination of information makes the job of the 'financier' harder. Why? Well, first the spread of information about price changes makes their job harder by making the market less predictable. It isn't about who is influencing the market, but rather that the market is becoming far more volatile. A volatile market can, and has, pissed off those who are unable to keep up with the inflating prices. I see posts after virtually every spike that are made by someone who mentions that they will now won't be able to afford x card and that they were saving up for it, etc. It also causes problems with online retailers, from who everyone orders including myself and the financiers, when they don't honor a sale price due to a spike. And finally, the increased volatility of the market reduces the knowledge-gap exploited by the financiers - price changes are more extreme and less predictable and are thus harder to prepare for and get ahead of the curve on. All this being said, I still don't think that this sub is causing price spikes, per se, but I do think that it is facilitating the spread of information about spikes and that some within the community would prefer that information not be spread so quickly or so widely."
mtgmarketwatch,2vnwbt,SaffronOlive,3,Thu Feb 12 18:47:57 2015 UTC,"Personally, I'm for more all for more, faster information for everyone. While I'm not a fan of some posts in this sub (because I find them short and lacking in thought), this is true for r/magictcg and many other subs. Plus, the wonderful thing about Reddit is that is has a built-in way for the community to moderate itself by voting. If I think a post is not beneficial/education/etc, I'll just click the downvote button.   And don't worry about me, I'll find something to write about ;)"
mtgmarketwatch,2vnwbt,GrossoGGO,2,Thu Feb 12 21:35:25 2015 UTC,By financiers I more meant those who make a living buying/selling cards and less those who write about the game. Probably should have clarified that point in my previous post.
mtgmarketwatch,2vnwbt,mtd14,23,Thu Feb 12 21:38:15 2015 UTC,"I'll take some time to give an update on what I think of the subreddit.  I think the nearly non existent moderation is going well. We are not causing artificial spikes, and in fact speculations seem to be the minority of posts. Rather, most of our posts are post climb ""Kaliaa foil now at 100"", ""Buyout on Black Sun's Zenith Gameday Promo"", etc. We are acting as a live feed and analysis of what is changing instead of a catalyst, which is what I was hoping for when I started marketwatch.  However, there does seem to be an odd dislike of prominent members of the community, like Corbin and Jason, in this sub. I know many people here seem to dislike mtgfinance because it's all articles, but articles aren't bad. They're usually very well thought out posts, and it's a shame to see them downvoted and reported (I ignore the reports). Luckily, the comments are usually okay and the authors do a fantastic job of handling themselves and understand it's the vocal few.  In regards to the article, I believe the mtgfinance community does have a terrible habit of causing artificial spikes, sometimes on huge scales like we are seeing with Tiny Leaders. However, I also feel it's fake for BSB to try to separate themselves from spikes when writers tweet things like ""Definitely feel like Doran can go to at least $13. Very powerful Tiny Leader/Modern card with low supply, and unique effect. #mtgfinance"" [x], because that's somehow different than ""this buyout brigade nonsense."""

mtgmarketwatch,2vnwbt,CorpT,10,Thu Feb 12 18:33:57 2015 UTC,Corbin is certainly the most reasonable of them.  Which is why people are much less hostile to him here than the others.
mtgmarketwatch,2vnwbt,mtd14,8,Thu Feb 12 18:46:14 2015 UTC,"Douglas sure, but Corbin is a nice guy even when the other side isn't and Jason is usually only harsh when warranted. Although I'm not a twitter guy so that conversation was not a side I had seen before today, and I'll be more aware on that front."

It's absurd that MTGfinance is just all links to BSB/MTGPrice/etc. And sometimes a few of those articles slip through the cracks and make their way here.  Douglas' last article Rent a Car(d) being one of them.

It actually started moving in direct response to Sam Black's SCG article on the 31st but curtailed because the wrong videos were used in the article and it needed be taken down to be fixed. Once the article was posted again on the 5th the card took off."

I'm not sure when prices started to rise. Usually, posts like those are a reflection of what happened not you can jump in on this too!"

I am willing to take the hit and let people think I have that much money sitting around.  On an unrelated note, if anyone wants to meet with someone who clearly is doing well for themselves as seen by them blowing tens of thousands on Magic cards, I'll be at GP Vegas and you may have the privilege of treating me to lunch."
mtgmarketwatch,2vnwbt,GosuMagic,3,Thu Feb 12 18:06:12 2015 UTC,"You are all wrong. The post started 2/5/2015. Before it was posted here. That very night, players started buying out Ghostway. Orders didn't get processed until 2/6 or 2/7. The reddit post didn't show up until the 2/6 when the orders were already in. Here is proof:  click me  I believe this was actually the 2nd spike that happened. It seems like people weren't sure if it was wise until the above video was released. So the link about Ghostway in mtgmarketwatch showed up (2/6/15) only after two spikes. By that time, it was too late."
mtgmarketwatch,2vnwbt,RoseofThorns,-7,Thu Feb 12 18:32:53 2015 UTC,"Interesting to note that I don't (and didn't in the article) blame marketwatch for the spike on Ghostway, or any other specific card. I simply stated ""There is a discussion going on as to whether or not marketwatch is the cause of this."""
mtgmarketwatch,2vnwbt,mtd14,3,Thu Feb 12 18:43:14 2015 UTC,"The statement you quoted was also immediately followed by a statement that the threads were banned prior due to an ""obvious ability to manipulate the prices of stupid random cards."" Then it's followed up by a paragraph that's pretty clearly leading towards marketwatch being responsible for Ghostaway. Just reading the paragraph below in isolation you can surely see how it seems to be the case. If you didn't mean that, my apologies for assuming but it does seem like I'm not the only one who interpreted it that way. Perhaps next time say definitely what the source was, which in this case was Sam Black's article as evidenced by the timing pointed out by Gosu.   Now, there’s a discussion being raised that the lack of aggressive moderating on /r/marketwatch is causing the same trend that happened with Fist of Suns. We recently saw Ghostway spike to over $15 due to hype of a brand new Modern deck, but the deck didn’t even end up performing very well. However, the buyout happened, and Ghostway will likely be stuck somewhere between its pre- and post-spike price. This ends up hurting the EDH and casual players who just wanted to flicker a bunch of allies or soul sisters."
mtgmarketwatch,2vnwbt,GosuMagic,5,Thu Feb 12 18:55:54 2015 UTC,"I am butt hurt that Corbin artificially spiked Gilt-Leaf Archdruid. Now it's so expensive, I can't afford to play EDH. Corbin, thanks for killing the EDH community. /joke"

mtgmarketwatch,2vnwbt,worldchrisis,5,Thu Feb 12 19:13:04 2015 UTC,"It seems weird that writers are so quick to point out the poor casual and EDH players in the Ghostway discussion, when they have been advocating stocking up on EDH staples for a year now."
mtgmarketwatch,2vnwbt,RoseofThorns,-4,Thu Feb 12 20:41:09 2015 UTC,"I'm willing to accept that I might be wrong here, but I always interpreted ""stock up on"" as ""buy a few for when it eventually happens due to real demand"", as opposed to ""drop as much money is required to reduce the supply on the Internet to zero, and force the spike to occur unnaturally."""
mtgmarketwatch,2vnwbt,worldchrisis,5,Thu Feb 12 20:44:29 2015 UTC,"How much do you think buyouts are the result of the latter as compared to several people doing the former because they're all acting on the same advice?  Would several people buying a playset or two of a low-stock card not cause essentially the same, ""unnatural"", effect as one person buying all of them?  I've looked at TCGplayer during buyouts before. It doesn't go from 50-0 all at once. The cheap listings with several available go first, then the cheap singles, then the moderately priced with several available, then you see cheap copies going away on ebay and other notable vendor sites elsewhere. It seems to me that with exceptions for extremely rare cards with <20 copies available, usually the case with older foils, buyouts are a result of multiple people acting on the same advice."
mtgmarketwatch,2vnwbt,Rock-swarm,2,Thu Feb 12 20:58:13 2015 UTC,"This needs to be much higher in the thread. People buying for personal collections is almost always a greater impact on a card's price than the guys trying to find value for re-sale. Ghostway is a perfect example when asked from the perspective of a former pod player. ""Man, this ghostway tech seems like it could be competitive. Couldn't hurt to throw $10-20 towards a playset in case it's the real deal."""
mtgmarketwatch,2vnwbt,worldchrisis,2,Thu Feb 12 22:32:43 2015 UTC,"""Sam Black wrote an article about this deck. Sam Black is good at coming up with weird decks that end up being good. I like this concept, let me buy a playset before it spikes.""  That seems like the rationale behind people buying this card.  I recently bought a playset of Living Wish because some guy made Top 4 of a Legacy Open playing 4 in a Maverick shell. If that deck becomes popular, that card is going to be priced similarly to Burning Wish probably. Also it's just a generally useful card that gets better as more cards are printed, and it's from Judgement, which is old.   Living Wish has done nothing in Legacy since then, and my cards are worth no more than they were when I bought them, but what if someone had written an article and mentioned Living Wish and 10 other people had the same thought I did? It would probably have doubled based on cheap playsets being bought up and people raising prices in response to demand.   Is that an irresponsible hype spike?"
mtgmarketwatch,2vnwbt,Morzas,8,Thu Feb 12 22:56:40 2015 UTC,The Ghostway buyout happened independently of this sub. The dude who wrote that article is either looking to sling mud or didn't do his research.
mtgmarketwatch,2vnwbt,RoseofThorns,-6,Thu Feb 12 18:36:57 2015 UTC,"I didn't claim that this sub caused it. The intent of the article was to mention that the sub wasn't responsible for the Ghostway spike, but was evidently worded very poorly and didn't get my point across at all."
mtgmarketwatch,2vnwbt,dudemagics,14,Thu Feb 12 19:14:22 2015 UTC,"Lets be honest the whole thing isnt about artificial spikes, its a bit more complicated and different things got their own dynamic, which led to this situation.  I believe, call me a conspiracy guy whatever, if you have been a member of QS you will quickly come to the conclusion that their main selling point is the single card discussion forum: most posts, most views ...  So we had the situation that the old /mtgfinance was adopting this kind off, just with more menace to it (fist of suns), but I have seen similar recommendations in the QS forum. So their main selling point, their unique selling proposition, wasn't that unique anymore, which led to aggressive resistance from some persons, arguing they want to protect the sheep, which got picked up and got a certain momentum which led to the sitatuion we have now. Were several things(pro tour buyouts, commander buyouts, QS buyouts, reddit buyouts, people who just want their cards at a good price and so on),  which don't have a direct connection in itself are all thrown into a pot, are mixed together and now seem like one problem to the magic(finance) community.  I think we all should calm down a bit, its still a self-regulating market.  hope this makes sense to you, because my english isnt the best. obv smurf"

mtgmarketwatch,2vnwbt,anonfinmage,6,Thu Feb 12 20:38:21 2015 UTC,Perhaps someone with a QS account should start anonymously posting these to this sub. They could include a bitcoin tip jar to help pay for the QS subscription.
mtgmarketwatch,2vnwbt,worldchrisis,4,Thu Feb 12 21:10:14 2015 UTC,"None of the calls are revolutionary and all the conclusions can be reached by anyone in the community with access to the same public information.  I was only a QS sub for a month but it's generally stuff like   ""GGT is $1, it's a key piece of legacy dredge which has top 8'd X opens over the past year, and it has the potential to be unbanned in Modern. It's probably a good card to have a playset or two of.""  There's similar logic for EDH cards from old sets with low availability.  Basically, go look at what cards are played in popular formats, find cards with prices that don't line up with other cards that see similar play and have similar availability, buy those cards, wait. That's all MTGFinance is."
mtgmarketwatch,2vnwbt,WigginIII,10,Thu Feb 12 21:35:39 2015 UTC,"What is amazing is, over on /r/mtgfinance, there has been no discussion about the significant moves Standard cards are experiencing.  Do you remember when Ashiok was $7 and everyone thought it was a good buy? Then it rose, then dropped back down to 9, and has suddenly rose to $14?  Not to mention the slow and steady gains of Urborg  Or the fact that, you should no longer be giving away your copies of Favored Hoplite away for free, as its over a buck each for an uncommon we might all have dozens of.  All are examples of cards that all rose significantly with little to no mention from all the finance writers. It's like everyone is looking for home runs and ignoring the steady gainers."
mtgmarketwatch,2vnwbt,worldchrisis,9,Thu Feb 12 22:37:07 2015 UTC,Yea /r/mtgfinance at this point is basically just an rss feed for Gathering Magic/BSB/MTGPrice/MTGStocks/Chas/Corbin/MtgGoldfish with a comments section.  There's no actual community-led discussion.

The problem is when the only posts allowed are blog links and mod posts.   It sets a precedent that if you don't have a blog on a known website, you aren't trustworthy enough to start a thread, which means a discussion of a topic can only be started if one of the trusted blogwriters decides to write about it."

mtgmarketwatch,2vnwbt,worldchrisis,2,Thu Feb 12 23:29:27 2015 UTC,Biased is an understatement. There's one post on the front page that isn't a blog link or a Mod post.

We have a finance community.  Labeling writers as ""not part of the community"" because they post on another site instead of on Reddit is contributing to the problems this post is discussing.   Maybe you weren't here 3-5+ years ago, when ""Magic finance"" was a joke on every website and no one would ever consider paying an author to write about the subject. I'm proud that we've moved to a point where most magic sites have some sort of finance content, and we're not regulated to making self-posts on Reddit in the hopes of one day being taken seriously by the community-at-large. This is an accomplishment, not something to be vilified for."

The fact is, as a platform to discuss daily market changes /r/mtgfinance fails miserably. A disconnect didn't derive from the fact that /r/mtgfinance became largely useless, it was just unfortunate. Thankfully this sub was created.  You're missing the point as to why people are being vilified, why there is disconnect. To put it simply it's because of stuff like this. This type of unjustified elitism does nothing but divide and degrade the community as a whole. It's super unfortunate that he's a ""thought leader"" because people are encouraged to act similarly/associate with him. When you associate with a huge scumbag like that you shouldn't be surprised when you're treated similarly."

Otherwise, it's another post perpetuating the divide between authors and readers by excluding us from the definition of ""community.""  Reddit is not blameless here. When I post articles on the Magic finance group on facebook, no one insults me or calls it ""blogspam"" because I posted it on a website and not within Facebook directly. No one trolls me in the comments section because of something another writer said on Twitter. But they do on Reddit, because there is anonymity. That's not a coincidence.  I don't agree with everything other writers post publicly, just like I don't agree with everything posted publicly on Reddit.

In the end, there's nothing stopping a casual player from drawing ""Ghostway"" on a basic land and using that with a casual group.  Why should someone casual care about the meaningless commodification of cardboard?  It only comes into play if the person wants to play in an environment where people actually care about paying money for MTG cards.    We can talk about the perception of value and our consumerist systems of objects more, but... why do you even write your articles?    Your very first article for Brainstorm Brewery:   Hello everyone, and welcome to a new article series here on BrainstormBrewery.com. My name is Douglas (DJ) Johnson, and I’m here to aid the Brew Crew in the never-ending goal of helping you squeeze monetary value out of this card game that we all know and love.  ""DJ Johnson – A Smartphone is Only as Smart as its User,"" November 26, 2013   Indeed.  A great goal.  Squeezing monetary value out of this card game that we all know and love isn't a bad thing!  More from your archive:   Welcome, speculators! Magic financiers, PTQ grinders, EDH junkies: you’re here because you want to not spend so much money on this game we all know and love, and are looking to find a place to learn to do just that.  ""Conjured Currency #11: Speculation for Annihilation,"" May 1, 2014   Okay.  Not always feasible, considering the paradigm.  Next, from your aptly-titled ""What's the Next Spike?"" section of a later article:   Now let’s go back to speculating. Everyone loves speculating, right? The feeling of being correct on a spec is so much fun, everyone wants to be ahead of the trend and one of the cool kids. I’ve mentioned before that I no longer buy cards for speculative purposes, and that’s still true. However, I’ll throw around some ideas on what could happen to the prices of certain cards now that the format got turned upside down.  ""Conjured Currency #46: A Modern Modern Format,"" January 22, 2015   You no longer buy cards for speculative purposes, okay.   my pro tour speculation purchases are listed below.  8x Hive Mind  ""Conjured Currency #50: Artificial Spikes,"" February 12, 2015   Oh.  I guess that was short-lived.   As you’ll often see me mention on Reddit or in my other articles, I tend to avoid speculating, only occasionally buying a couple sets of a card for fun.  ""Conjured Currency #50: Artificial Spikes,"" February 12, 2015   Ah.  You ""tend to avoid speculating.""  Just ""for fun"" speculating is okay, but anything more than that is bad?    Unfortunately, I have a theory that a growing number of Magic players see the pro tour more as an opportunity to make money while sitting at home in front of their computer, rather than as an event to watch for entertainment.  ""Conjured Currency #50: Artificial Spikes,"" February 12, 2015   If you think a card will rise in price, and you have the opportunity to buy the card at a lower price, would you not buy it to make a profit?  I still think it's ridiculous that you have so many articles and posts about MTG ""speculating"" and then get mad about what you perceive are the ""evil"" speculators.  As you said in the beginning, the goal of buying, trading, and selling Magic: the Gathering cards is to ""squeeze monetary value out of this card game that we all know and love.""  Deal with it."

mtgmarketwatch,2vnwbt,willaeon,6,Thu Feb 12 19:17:02 2015 UTC,"On all levels, that's how the game has always been played.  To pretend anything else is delusional.  Some examples, from a macro and micro level:  1. ""Well I've done some calculations and I think it would take between 22000-25000$ to wipe out the screen [of MTGO dual lands]""   Magic is obviously a very niche and inconsequential subject to have great ideas about. Seriously we're not curing cancer over here or solving starvation but it's still one of the most fun things to think about in the world. Anyway sometimes when they come these great ideas don't do anything except change how you and everyone else you know view some facet of the world. That's what happened to me at the beginning of July 2011.  People like Magic. They also like making money. They are also generally quite lazy. Combining the first two and overcoming the last is like inventing Reese's Peanut Butter Cups yourself adding them to ice cream and then getting people to pay you to eat them.  ""Next Level Spec #5 - The Big Spec,"" by Ted Knutson (8/17/11)   2. ""Pick up literally every single Zendikar fetch you can find for $12 or lower, and trade for them aggressively (ideally with overpriced Innistrad goodies), and you’ll be looking very good a few years from now.""   Before the sale, to my knowledge I was the largest private holder of fetchlands in Oklahoma, and none of the local stores had nearly as many. I’m not going to lie, that’s kind of a cool feeling. And when I sold I made a nice sum of money from this deal.  ""I Sold My Fetchlands (And You Should Too),"" by Corbin Hosler (1/23/13)     I've made a lot of money off this game.  There are countless examples of people making money off of this game.  The collectible card system of Magic is designed to ""squeeze monetary value out of this card game that we all know and love.""  You encourage buying collections to turn them into profits.  You talk about speculating on Rabblemasters, mentioning your mistake in not correctly predicting how they would climb.  You tell people to buy and aggressively trade for cards...  You say it pretty well yourself:   You know you got a pretty good deal just based on the binder, but we want to maximize value while minimizing time and effort.   You want to maximize value.  It's more than obvious that you are a part of the system, and part of the ""problem"" with squeezing monetary value out of this card game.  Especially since magic finance is your ""day job.""  Being part of the system doesn't bother me!  I like acquiring things for $X.XX and profiting from them for $Y.YY when it is to my advantage."
mtgmarketwatch,2vnwbt,RoseofThorns,-9,Thu Feb 12 20:40:02 2015 UTC,"Maybe this is just cognitive dissonance, but I always thought there was a difference between ""buy a few copies of something for when it eventually goes up due to real demand"" and ""spend as much as is needed to reduce the supply on the Internet to zero, and force the TCG mid to go up on your own"""
mtgmarketwatch,2vnwbt,willaeon,11,Thu Feb 12 20:46:42 2015 UTC,"I would say there's some serious cognitive dissonance on your part.  Just look at some of what you've been posting on twitter:  http://i.imgur.com/3FtQSFR.png  Serious, serious cognitive dissonance.

mtgmarketwatch,2vnwbt,merfolk_looter,7,Thu Feb 12 22:46:07 2015 UTC,"I agree.  Not 100%, but I do agree that this sub and twitter, articles are the reason why alot of 'normal' MTG'ers hate anything related to the 'finance' aspect of the game.  I don't talk about anything finance related with anyone now because it's become such a dirty word around here.  I mean, rightly so.  People with money are pricing other people out of the game we love."
mtgmarketwatch,2vnwbt,Rock-swarm,8,Thu Feb 12 16:23:56 2015 UTC,"Define ""people with money"". Is it dudes that can afford to buy ABUR duals? Power? Or is your definition broad enough to include some guy buying a playset of vengevines just in case the dredge deck becomes viable in modern? Because ALL of those people influence the price you pay for singles on the secondary market. There's an extremely childish aspect to MTGFinance that implicitly shames individuals that have the disposable income to speculate on any given card. This occurs despite the fact that the market itself will determine if that individual is going to gain or lose value from that transaction.  It's almost a caveman approach to MTGFinance -  PT hits, and Junk staples experience buyouts ""This sucks, I didn't want to pay for LOTV already, but now I'm even further behind!"" Proceeds to blame the people capable of making a purchase for LOTV, or the guys that traded/bought the cards when LOTV was rotating out of standard.  Seriously, should I be the one that feels bad when a guy is trying to show me his binder full of draft chaff when I'm only looking to pick up multi-format staples? I could delve into our absurd cultural phenomenon of celebrating the ability to become outraged/offended over anything, but that's a little off-topic.  It all just smacks of sour grapes and false controversy to me."
mtgmarketwatch,2vnwbt,merfolk_looter,2,Thu Feb 12 16:49:53 2015 UTC,"My comment was vague!  I didn't mean to hit a nerve with 'people with money' more like, people who want to buyout a card just to raise the price of the card.  Cards like Lilly are destined to go up (maybe due to buyouts, but more likely demand) until she's reprinted.  I'm fine with that.    What I'm not fine with is some hyper/spexer saying, 'buy out xxx card!'"
mtgmarketwatch,2vnwbt,Theangryhermit,3,Thu Feb 12 17:07:33 2015 UTC,"I am not a fan of all the down voting and calls for censorship on both sides going on.  I like Mtgmarketwatch because it will have everything (articles and community opinions).   Amulet of Vigor was a very poor example. For one thing the author bought 8 copies of hive mind. They go in the same deck.   The justification ""the deck is too complicated to play"" is really poor reasoning. A significant amount of Magic players LOVE to show of how smart they are and will be MORE attracted to the deck because of those comments. Sure, most will play it poorly but that doesn't affect the finance value until a few weeks from now when they decide ""this deck sucks, Cohen got really lucky"".  Back before MTG finance was a thing for the Everyman, I remember my local store running out of Dralnu's because people wanted to build that deck."
mtgmarketwatch,2vnwbt,davekayaus,4,Fri Feb 13 01:12:29 2015 UTC,"The issue here, once again is nothing -nothing to do with this subreddit and everything to do with the interests of the echo chamber trying to run a certain other subreddit for their own financial gain.  Mtgfinance is dead air and has been for some time. This sub actually allows --shock, horror!-- people to talk about Magic card prices.  The 'complaints' are mere squeakings from those who believe they are entitled to their monopoly on magic card price discussion. They are wrong. If you ignore them, they really will go away."
mtgmarketwatch,2vnwbt,mtg_liebestod,8,Fri Feb 13 07:17:09 2015 UTC,"As I said in the other thread, and as people have pointed out examples of here, the real issue here is not hypocrisy... it's elitism. When a BSB regular hypes up a card, it's okay because they're part of a self-appointed elite. When a random user on /r/mtgmarketwatch does it, it's irresponsible and harmful (particularly when that user's view is at odds with those of certain members of this elite.)  Importantly, the elites aren't necessary wrong on this. They're just going to have to deal with the fact that even if they're right not everyone is going to listen to them and you're not going to be able to control those who don't. /r/mtgfinance tried and now here we are.  And honestly, even though I trust Jason or Corbin more than an /r/mtgmarketwatch random, the barriers to entry for this ""elite"" are basically non-existent... you just need to have a blog and a twitter account and the ability to not completely piss off the wrong people. This isn't a very high bar to clear. Like, what are the OP's qualifications? No offense to him in particular, but to illustrate a point. Do I trust him that much because he uses the BSB brand? No."
mtgmarketwatch,2vnwbt,GosuMagic,4,Thu Feb 12 19:58:41 2015 UTC,"It might just be both Hypocrisy and Elitism. You see it differently than I do. I saw no spikes happening as a result of /r/mtgmarketwatch. All the spikes I uncovered came directly as a result from your so-called elitist writers. Not only do they not know, that they are the problem, they choose to blame others and complain about it. That is Hypocrisy."
mtgmarketwatch,2vnwbt,mtg_liebestod,2,Thu Feb 12 23:39:26 2015 UTC,"Well, this gets to a second point I forgot to put in my first post... I trust Jason and Corbin on some stuff, but I find the arguments about whether spike posts cause spikes to be very poorly-argued, and I don't think the ""elites"" here have too much insight into this matter, as determining cause and effect here is pretty difficult. I remember seeing the issue argued on /r/mtgfinance and I think there is some anecdotal evidence in favor of the notion, but I don't think that proves very much."
mtgmarketwatch,2vnwbt,GosuMagic,2,Fri Feb 13 00:11:15 2015 UTC,"They hide it by saying it's a spec and not a spike. In reality, a spec = spike. They themselves might not spend money on speculating but their subscribers sure do. If anything, the QS forums are the ones causing all these spikes. But if we post a spec, it will infringe upon their livelihood. Hence all the backlash we've been getting. They need to protect their business."
mtgmarketwatch,2vnwbt,atriusfox,3,Fri Feb 13 00:28:14 2015 UTC,"This is a good point and something a lot of people don't seem to understand.  While I definitely think the more experienced MTG Finance people (I will not call them elite as that is a separatist mentality already) have bungled the public relations aspect of this, they are not entirely wrong that there are dangers inherent with how things can be handled.  Doesn't mean that those dangers are happening.  Let's take an analogy that I hope might work:  My dad keeps a nice tidy lawn.  He puts lots of effort into gardening/weeding/watering etc.  Most of that effort is not noticed by others.  Our neighbors over the years have commented about what a nice lawn we have, and some have tried to imitate my dad.  'I mow it everytime he mows it, I put on fertilizer every time he does, I do blah blah blah'  And they do this without understanding.  For example you can overfertilize your lawn, just cause you do it when he does it doesn't mean you aren't putting too much/too little.  Lawnmowers can adjust the height of the grass.  Sometimes people cut it too short, or too long.  We see obvious things that these people do and think it's easy when there is a lot more to it.  They in turn can (should?) explain WHY it is not working for us and why what we're doing is causing problems.  (Everybody bought Vengevines, now I bought Vengevines.  Where's my money?)  I think there is a second part of this (having been reading/following both threads for awhile), they used to.  But as more and more people are involved there are always going to be people who either   A) Don't listen  B) Get it wrong once in awhile (everybody makes mistakes)  C) Purposely take advantage of situations (this is one people are harping about a lot, people trying to force spikes).  and these guys with more experience have lost their patience with the rest of us.  How annoying is it to tell a child that what they are doing is wrong and they should stop?  Only to have them keep doing it?  Noone here is a child, but there is constantly new people who are introduced who do not have the experience these other guys have.  They can be mature and keep trying to teach, or let it go.  Getting mad about it and some of the general behavior is not healthy to a community.  So I agree, there are those with more experience warning us of dangers that exist, but they aren't doing so in an effective manner.  This is just my opinion."
mtgmarketwatch,2vnwbt,mtg_liebestod,4,Thu Feb 12 20:54:12 2015 UTC,"I really don't think elite is an unfair term to use here. These are people who think that only they should be trusted with various financial calls, and that they have a duty to actively ""protect"" the community from being exposed to unqualified opinions. They're a benevolent elite, in their own eyes."
mtgmarketwatch,2vnwbt,atriusfox,1 point,Thu Feb 12 21:47:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think that's the big difference.  I appreciate their input, but I don't think they are beholden to me.  They have no duty in my opinion.  I can see that argument, but I just personally don't agree."
mtgmarketwatch,2vnwbt,misterci,-1,Thu Feb 12 22:10:52 2015 UTC,"I think the big problem is the people who are uneducated about prices. When Ghostway shot up, the people who new what was going on were saying, ""Lol, its a win-more card that doesn't do anything on its own, I'll pass."" If more people thought like that instead of buying into the hype (almost always wrong), then the idiots who perform buyouts like this won't have anyway to dump them for profit and will therefore cut it out."

mtgmarketwatch,2vp32l,Zebo91,2,Thu Feb 12 21:53:23 2015 UTC,"Not likely, but possible. I think the two most probably situations for DTK are either Zendikar fetches or no fetches (maybe even no cycle of dual lands)."
mtgmarketwatch,2vp32l,rp_1,-2,Thu Feb 12 22:17:54 2015 UTC,"It cant be zendikar fetches unless they print another set of dual lands as well because as the dev team said, they cant have unbalanced color pairings. Like enemy painland with allied feteches."
mtgmarketwatch,2vp32l,Rock-swarm,3,Thu Feb 12 22:22:19 2015 UTC,"dont forget though, the enemy painlands will cycle out. If origins have no lands, then you'll need enemy fetches or some sort of enemy lands.  Origin seems like a good place to print the full set of buddy lands (since there will not be a great place to print them in the future)."
mtgmarketwatch,2vp32l,blindfremen,1 point,Thu Feb 12 22:26:12 2015 UTC,"That is true. But i dont think they would it on dtk, origins would be the ideal place since the overlap on lands is only a few months, plus dtk and origin should rotate out after kahns and frf if i remember correctly so they would have to give some kind of mana fixing then"
mtgmarketwatch,2vp32l,jjness,4,Thu Feb 12 22:34:43 2015 UTC,"Two things to consider -   WotC likes breaking their own rules just as much as following them. See: every block structure change since Lorwyn, DFC's, Modern banlist history, etc. Even when WotC put out that article talking about how they want to ensure a balanced manabase for standard, the format was immediately hit with the reprint of the enemy-only painlands. While the ""imbalance"" was only for a few months, it's just a natural occurrence unless WotC starts pulling the trigger on sets with 10 slots for rare manafixers.   I think it makes a lot of sense from a storyline standpoint and a marketing standpoint to have ZEN fetches in Dragons of Tarkir as opposed to MM2015 or Origins. MM2015 is going to sell itself with the likely targets for the set without ZEN fetches being necessary (remember, filter lands still haven't seen a reprint)."
mtgmarketwatch,2vp32l,Rippig,1 point,Thu Feb 12 22:54:20 2015 UTC,Origins is also a great place to reprint the filter lands like Graven Cairns.
mtgmarketwatch,2vp32l,SaffronOlive,2,Fri Feb 13 18:18:54 2015 UTC,"It can't is a strong sentiment, remember we had enemy painlands in standard for 3 months without an ally counterpart, and some of the temples went 6 months without having equivalencies. Also it makes sense to put them there because of how rotation works, you will have pain lands rotate and have an unbalance for a while. I don't think unbalanced color pairings is a fair argument unless you know all of the lands that will be printed in Magic: Origins and the next block, and the order in which they will be printed, which we don't."

Whether they are in the next mma set or the next standard, it doesn't matter. Their prices will drop and that is the only information that matters. Based on this, you should budget what you'll be spending your money on or when you should be selling your current Zendikar fetches. Manage your portfolio based on facts and don't worry about what might happen."
mtgmarketwatch,2vpg58,GosuMagic,-1,Fri Feb 13 00:04:42 2015 UTC,"i manage my portfolio on facts and hunches and gut feelings :-) as i do with my stock :-o i was just asking myself if i was alone in thinking that the zendikar fetches would not be reprinted, i think the majority wishes to get them this year and are projecting this in their statements, i to want them to but i don't see a reason why they should fire that canon so fast after the ones in print now."
mtgmarketwatch,2vpg58,mtd14,5,Fri Feb 13 07:55:01 2015 UTC,Put the question in the title next time so it's not click bait.
mtgmarketwatch,2vpg58,earthbinder,2,Fri Feb 13 15:55:36 2015 UTC,"I think they will put them in Dragons of Tarkir because they need to incentivize buying Dragons over Modern Masters 2015. Why would anyone but a standard player buy Dragons over Modern Masters if both are available (assuming Modern Masters 2 is more available, which we have been told it will be (let's hope...)). Modern Masters 2 has a higher price tag, yes, but it (presumably) has a better limited format and much higher value cards. Assuming the supply is there, you could very likely pay for a large percentage of your draft selling your singles, where as for Dragons you are presumably going to get crap that isn't worth a thing or crap that won't be worth a thing soon."
mtgmarketwatch,2vpg58,merfolk_looter,3,Fri Feb 13 03:31:57 2015 UTC,"It's also worth noting that Dragons of Tarkir will be another big set with 264 cards.  Unlike like the normal 3rd set in the block, because of the new rotation. So possibly more of a reason for the fetches."
mtgmarketwatch,2vl7gz,rp_1,2,Wed Feb 11 22:54:15 2015 UTC,I was thinking that a few of these cards would see a jump soon enough. Card Kingdom was having a buy list promo and I looked into it and noticed that there were quite a few cards that were being buy listed at or close to the current selling point (for cards that were sold out).

mtgmarketwatch,2vk76q,callmetwan,2,Thu Feb 12 01:56:44 2015 UTC,This is also the first card I speculated on too.   20 copies @49c.  Absolutely no one was talking about it (brainstorm brewery skipped it entirely in their set review) and I was starting to doubt my judgement.
mtgmarketwatch,2vk76q,GHChinMTG,1 point,Thu Feb 12 14:04:11 2015 UTC,"I've bought 16 at $0.49 last week.   I totally agree with your points, and I would like to add that Outpost Siege is a pretty much Phyrexian Arena in red. How the hell is it even under $1?"
mtgmarketwatch,2vk76q,mackslc,1 point,Fri Feb 13 04:04:56 2015 UTC,"I'm going to contest this comparison. First, Phyrexian Arena actually puts the card in your hand. Second, you don't have to show your opponent what it was. I realize these are small details but it changes everything. I don't disagree this is a good card but comparing it to Phyrexian Arena is a little off I think."
mtgmarketwatch,2vk76q,ProtoJMan,1 point,Sun Feb 22 19:37:28 2015 UTC,"While I agree with you that Phyrexian Arena is obviously superior, Outpost Siege is an approximation of Phyrexian Arena and its probably as close to a Phyrexian Arena red will ever get.   Outpost Siege is the hero Phyrexian Arena red deserves, not the one it needs."
mtgmarketwatch,2vk76q,ProtoJMan,1 point,Mon Feb 23 09:37:11 2015 UTC,"This card has a lot of potential. In RW Aggro it essentially reads as ""draw an extra card each turn"" which is obviously strong as hell, especially in a deck that is short on card drawing options. That said, its probably a 2-3 of at best in that deck due to its mana cost. Even if it becomes a staple in that deck, I can't see it exactly becoming a meta-shaping card for red. Prices will probably peak at $5 at absolute best before settlkng in the $2-$3 range. Not really much room to profit off here - but definitely a case of ""get your playset now if you still need it."""
mtgmarketwatch,2vk76q,Chosler88,1 point,Thu Feb 12 17:05:11 2015 UTC,Foil prices are really up there. I've seen it dance between 10-20. Trying to figure out when and where to push mine.
mtgmarketwatch,2vk76q,KidJustice,2,Mon Feb 23 19:39:45 2015 UTC,"I think there was a buyout a week or two ago on these, but it does fit in some EDH decks so I believe that is what was driving the demand for foils originally.   The spread should be pretty nice on non-foils by the end of the week. I mean, it's at the $3 mark and it's climbing pretty fast."

mtgmarketwatch,2vk76q,worldchrisis,1 point,Mon Feb 23 21:25:15 2015 UTC,"I can't imagine this going past $3 or thereabouts, though I think it's certainly worth pulling out of the bulk.  Also, an opponent at a Sealed event a few weeks ago had this active against me from about Turn 7 on, and managed to deck themselves with it while I stood at one life. That was a wild game."
mtgmarketwatch,2vk76q,KidJustice,-1,Wed Feb 11 19:27:08 2015 UTC,"well say its $.49 now. Goes to $3, buylists for $1.5 You're still making a buck a card before shipping. That doesn't sound bad to me considering people spend more to make about the same or less."
mtgmarketwatch,2vk76q,atriusfox,0,Wed Feb 11 20:03:10 2015 UTC,If you're making a buck before shipping you're making like 50 cents max after shipping. Not worth it.

Sapphire is the most played vintage card (ahead of black lotus) and therefore it commands a premium over the rest of the moxen.

mtgmarketwatch,2vh3ov,Bilb0Bagg1n5,16,Tue Feb 10 23:39:56 2015 UTC,"Spikes happen regardless of this, or any other sub.  No one on here was promoting Ghostway as the next Big Thing(tm), but it still got bought out.  I used the opportunity to unload quite a few of them, so I'm kind of pleased by it."
mtgmarketwatch,2vh3ov,Manadyne,3,Wed Feb 11 00:07:33 2015 UTC,"Exactly right. Blaming the channels in which speculation occurs is kinda like blaming Jerry Springer for all shitty TV programming - those shows were successful because they fulfilled a consumer demand.  I would really like to know if this unnamed twitter user actually quantified the ""badness"" of price spikes based on pre-PT rumors and post-PT results. I mean, price spikes existed in the time before 'value trading' and the smart-phone price checking became ubiquitous. At least nowadays the average MTG player has access to a wealth of basic (and advanced) MTG financial knowledge, which leads to smaller windows of opportunity. I would hardly call that a bad thing, it's simply a more competitive environment."
mtgmarketwatch,2vh3ov,Rock-swarm,25,Wed Feb 11 07:05:28 2015 UTC,"I'll throw in my two cents.  I don't think this sub in particular has a huge effect on the market, at least not yet. Back before /r/mtgfinance was more strictly modded we were seeing crazy spikes on random cards happen weekly based on posts in that sub. So it's not a stretch to say this place affects the market to an extent, and could affect it more as it grows.  I do think that may have some negative connotations for some players. Ghostway, for instance, is now more expensive for EDH players based on pure speculation from a Modern deck that turned out to be terrible. It will settle lower than the spike, of course, but higher than where it started and higher than where it would be if speculators didn't touch it.  But no one can control the market, and that's just the way it is. I'm cognizant of the fact that my words may lead to changes in the market, and I try to handle that responsibility as prudently as possible. I think the fear of many is that if (big if) this sub reaches the point where mtgfinance used to be — that is to say, one person makes a post and it's bought out in an hour by greater fools — we could see some ugly market behavior again.  But it is what it is. As Wiggin said, you adapt or you die. No one can control the market or market actors, and it's folly to try. All you can do is wield whatever slice of the market you have as responsibly as possible.  On that note, I know there are several people here with such a hatred for Brainstorm Brewery/QS they just downvote me on sight regardless of the content, but for everyone else reading I want to make it perfectly clear I do not speculate, and it's explicitly so I can avoid absurd accusations of things like ""intentionally delay(ing) the airing of brainstorm brewery so they can buy up the good picks.""  I run a store. I buy and sell a lot of cards. I do not need to hype a bad card to try and manipulate the market and make a few hundred bucks. It's simply not worth the effort, even if I found it morally acceptable (which I don't).   What I do value is my name, and my integrity. I'm aware that what I say or write can influence others, and I want that advice to always be as earnest as possible and not at all influenced by my own financial interests. So I don't spec.   Anyway, that's a long and rambly answer to the question, but I hope I shed some background on the topic at hand!"
mtgmarketwatch,2vh3ov,Chosler88,6,Wed Feb 11 10:05:01 2015 UTC,"First of all, no one is blaming or questioning you for these practices. As I mentioned in the Facebook group, I respect your integrity and it really shines through in your articles and your choice of words. Even your demeanor on the BSB podcast shows your professionalism. But this cannot be said about your other cohost. I'm not sure if he's just trying to be funny but it comes off childish and distasteful."
mtgmarketwatch,2vh3ov,GosuMagic,10,Wed Feb 11 15:59:41 2015 UTC,"Corbin won't admit it but deep down even he knows his cohost is a John Edward tier douchebag. Whenever he begins one of his tangents about the fucktards of this reddit you can feel the tension grow as they start to realize how he's simultaneously isolating listeners and degrading the podcast. If Jason got underneath Ghostway, he's a genius. If it spikes without him having any part in it, everyone who bought in is an idiot. He must deal with massive levels of cognitive dissonance on a daily basis."
mtgmarketwatch,2vh3ov,asmodeanreborn,3,Wed Feb 11 19:20:07 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, I very much respect your opinions and insight. I don't ever feel like you have an agenda or a superiority complex, unlike some other writers. I think this is why I pay more attention to your articles than most others.     I still don't think this sub does much in terms of creating spikes. The first Ghostway post here came after Ghostway was already 3/4 of the way to its peak, for example."
mtgmarketwatch,2vh3ov,RoseofThorns,-1,Wed Feb 11 17:37:57 2015 UTC,"This is pretty much exactly how I tried to word it in my article this week, but you did it better.

mtgmarketwatch,2vh3ov,Feline_o1,8,Thu Feb 12 14:45:47 2015 UTC,"If someone is complaining that a section of the internet is causing an uptick in $$$, the fact that they're complaining about it means they know about it, which means if they were smarter, they'd use that to their advantage, but since they are complaining, then either the advantage isn't there and this section of the internet isn't causing an uptick in $$$, or they're frustrated because they can't figure out how to use this to their advantage."
mtgmarketwatch,2vh3ov,roseffin,4,Wed Feb 11 07:35:11 2015 UTC,"I've wondered the same thing.  For a card which only had 1 page of listings on TCG it could be possible.  And once things sell out on TCG it could prompt other people to notice and act.    Magic cards can be thinly traded.  Buyouts could be the result of this group...or some Facebook group...or an influential tweet.  So we could be to blame, in some instances.  But there are plenty of threads where we are talking about things already happening in the marketplace that we obviously didn't start but may choose to react to (participate in the buying frenzy or maybe sell into the hype)."
mtgmarketwatch,2vh3ov,EsportsLottery,28,Tue Feb 10 23:53:45 2015 UTC,Hilarious seeing people who spike prices with pick of the weeks and quiet speculation complaining about price raises.  When they intentionally delay the airing of brainstorm brewery so they can buy up the good picks and quiet speculation is basically a site dedicated to buy outs.    It's amazing mtgfinance has evaded being banned by reddit admins for the level of advertising it does even with the authors themselves post their content.
mtgmarketwatch,2vh3ov,mtd14,12,Wed Feb 11 02:14:16 2015 UTC,"I believe the BSB hosts when they say they don't do much buying specs to remain neutral, especially since 2/3rds (not counting Marcel because MODO) have some sort of store setup where they rely on volume moreso than speculating.

mtgmarketwatch,2vh3ov,GosuMagic,10,Thu Feb 12 17:41:53 2015 UTC,They are whining because it's hurting their business. They are trying to spike cards up by releasing articles after they have bought them out. This sub is one step ahead of them and they are losing money. If you are trying to make a living by scamming others then you'd whine and complain too. Duh!
mtgmarketwatch,2vh3ov,Chosler88,2,Wed Feb 11 06:59:40 2015 UTC,"I'm curious, do you really think this is true? I cannot imagine that anyone could make any amount of money resembling a ""business"" with that tactic."
mtgmarketwatch,2vh3ov,GosuMagic,8,Wed Feb 11 10:11:27 2015 UTC,You're seriously going to come here and tell me that Gilt-Leaf Archdruid didn't spike after you released your article? Maybe you didn't buy out half the stores but anyone who writes articles can use this to make a huge profit. Take a look at the graphs. Look at when it spiked. And then look at when your article was published. Your article has a lot more impact than any post in this forum. So assuming you're not a scumbag but can you vouch for the rest of the writers out there?
mtgmarketwatch,2vh3ov,Chosler88,3,Wed Feb 11 15:21:52 2015 UTC,"I think maybe you misunderstood my response, especially since I'm not claiming that. As I said above I recognize what I write can influence some behaviors. And I certainly can't speak for others. But my point was I don't consider the money one would have made on Archdruid to be ""business."" The EV of trying to buy out a card, manipulate the market through writing and then sell out of it is lower than just delivering pizzas in that time.   I just don't find it particularly fair that you're not only disparaging the group as a whole, you're msking very specific accusations without even a modicum of evidence. Someone is allowed to write finance articles without being called a scammer."
mtgmarketwatch,2vh3ov,GosuMagic,1 point,Wed Feb 11 18:05:21 2015 UTC,I only referred to it as a business because some have claimed to do this full time. Maybe you're right and you can't make a living out of it but it still holds true that there is profit to be made. I pointed out your article not to disparage you but to let others know that these articles will affect prices more so than some kid posting a buyout. The only evidence we need to see are the prices skyrocketing after the release of an article.
mtgmarketwatch,2vh3ov,Chosler88,1 point,Wed Feb 11 18:39:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah I understand, and I agree. I just hope the reason they affect prices more is because the author has earned the respect of the audience, and I don't think that happens if they're trying ""to make a living by scamming others."""

mtgmarketwatch,2vh3ov,mewcuss,17,Wed Feb 11 00:01:53 2015 UTC,"It's (obviously) highly debatable. None of this has actually been quantified but from a purely logical standpoint the idea that this sub can be solely attributed to card spikes is completely asinine. I'm sure it's in some way a contributor but ultimately pales in comparison to all of the other mtgfinance content producers out there. A handful of cards spiked after seeing competitive play/being the centerpiece of articles in conjunction with a metagame shake-up and anticipation for their format's largest event and your response was ""It's those fucktards over at the mtgmarketwatch sub!"". It's laughable. You're no better than the people you yourself condemn for placing blame on quiet speculation for triggering buyouts.  I wanted you to remain nameless but honestly, anyone who even remotely follows mtgfinance probably noticed you constantly referring to the people in this sub as ""fucktards"", ""idiots"" and etc. I personally found this to be extremely comical as your recent advice/card evaluation has been so poor (Tasigur?) that it's clear to me whose mtgfinance prowess truly merits questioning. This game has seen explosive growth over the years and in turn so has the mtgfinance community. I understand that you aren't exactly ecstatic about others encroaching on your very livelihood but your response has been so immature that at times I'm embarrassed for you.

mtgmarketwatch,2vh3ov,mtg_liebestod,13,Wed Feb 11 04:07:27 2015 UTC,I can't think of too many cases where this sub mentioned a card before it spiked. Could you give a few examples?
mtgmarketwatch,2vh3ov,GosuMagic,8,Wed Feb 11 01:38:38 2015 UTC,"What would be better would be to just look at all the spikes, and see which ones are ""questionable"", and then which ones can be traced back to posts here, if possible.

mtgmarketwatch,2vh3ov,mtg_liebestod,9,Wed Feb 11 07:03:49 2015 UTC,It's also pretty dishonest of Jason to blame this sub when just about every article on mtgfinance is crossposted here as well. Some writers have been more receptive and willing to post there content than others. SafronOlive for example makes sure he gets as many eyes to see his articles as possible. Others seem to feel their information deserves a paywall or only a select group of elites.
mtgmarketwatch,2vh3ov,WigginIII,8,Wed Feb 11 08:39:25 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't call it dishonest. One thing that I never really liked about the /r/mtgfinance ""elite"" is that the argument was never ""let's not hype cards"", it was ""it's okay when we do it but not when you do it because we know what we're doing."" That seems to be the position that Jason continues to embrace.  [Edit]  And it's sorta-reflected in Corbin's post as well. The problem for these people isn't the herd behavior itself (which can't be suppressed), it's that they feel that the herd needs to be shepherded by people like them. That's why this community is dangerous."

mtgmarketwatch,2vh3ov,worldchrisis,-1,Wed Feb 11 17:31:47 2015 UTC,"To be perfectly blunt: I hope I am a thought leader. The goal is to give good advice others agree with. As Gosu's upvoted post above points out, price increases can be tied to articles or BSB episodes, so it seems I've had some success in that goal. I assume we're referencing John Oliver here, so the continue the comparison the difference is my thoughts aren't influenced by money, because I don't spec and no one tells me what to write about.   For me, it's not about being more ""elite"" than anyone else, because I'm not. It was only a few years ago I was the random college kid speaking up and challenging the big names at the time (Medina). But if I affect the behavior of others in any small way, I feel an obligation to my readers to handle that responsibly.

With that said, these tenets have literally been re-hashed at least once every two weeks since the inception of mtgmarketwatch and mtgfinance. It might just be a product of not having a good FAQ on either subreddit, but it's honestly a waste of time to see these articles for a significant portion of the community.   I also can't help but think that this article is just half-assed. If you are aiming for the ""new"" crowd, why on earth wouldn't you spend the time to go more in-depth on the aspects you brought up in the article? A single example of a more-valuable-than-expected uncommon isn't going to cut it.   This article could have been 5 articles, broken down with enough examples (or even better, a graph/spreadsheet) to show whatever trend you are discussing and enough data to make it worthwhile for more experienced readers to be engaged in the topic. Yeah, it's more effort, but that's entirely the point of having content that people actually want to read. I would read the shit out of a list of the top 50 most valuable buylisted-uncommons to come out in the last 3 or 4 blocks.

It's not an easy card to reprint because Green just doesn't do what Sylvan Library does anymore, so the chances of a sudden reprint in a new block are near non-existent, with the chance of it in a supplemental set being low.  If someone did something extreme like forcing a buyout prices would explode and likely stay that way because of price memory and ridiculously low stock."

I think this is what happened to the foil CA version. I liken Sylvan Library to Survival of the Fittest. They're both old school, powerful green enchantments. Both are heavy green staples in EDH and Cube, see occasional play in legacy (vintage for Survival), and are unavailable in Modern. The only difference (a big one) is that Library is reprintable, though I agree with you that they won't reprint it soon.   Couple that with the extremely limited print run of the CA library.

mtgmarketwatch,2v93k3,Lepongemagique,2,Mon Feb 9 01:38:55 2015 UTC,"The price increased because of the B&R list changes, similarly to pretty much anything non-pod/non-delver. This movement was not really due to PT speculations, rather, the Pro Tour was just a step and that specific event didn't put UWR mid-range/control in the top decks.  The price inflation was mostly speculation about the next Modern environment and the price deflation is/will be mostly speculation as well. I'm sure without a PT SR will still be in the 16-20 Tix range.  So in all probability Sphinx's Revelation will go back around 9-10 Tix, its prices before the changes triggered by the B&R list announcement.  Now this trend could be stopped, and even reverted to a downward trend because of the ongoing Modern MOCS seasons on MTGO. MTGO is not paper world and this is not a PT anymore. The metagame may change and evolved. If UWR strategies are more successful then SR could increase a little bit.  Also, as a Modern playable and casual-friendly mythic of a ""good"" redeemable set (the last with $5 fees) the bottom of SR is pretty much capped until redemption stops.  With this, and according to its level of play in the following weeks, SR could stabilize in the 12-14 range or even move in the upper 15-17.  Mid terms or long terms, with or without redemption, played or not in Modern, SR should most likely stay over 10 Tix at anytime.  PS: If crashing hard is going from 17 to 14 Tix because of light speculative movements, what do you say about Birthing Pod, from 20 to probably under 0.5 Tix in one month?"

mtgmarketwatch,2v8e1n,blindfremen,1 point,Sun Feb 8 23:57:38 2015 UTC,Just like last time... ..sell into the hype.  This deck is only good if you're willing to play 60 minute rounds (like at the PT) and you are VERY good player.
mtgmarketwatch,2v8e1n,merfolk_looter,1 point,Mon Feb 9 01:32:10 2015 UTC,"I agree with selling, but so honestly feel like people are making too big a deal of it being difficult to pilot. It may be more difficult than some decks like Anti-Abzen or Bogles, but overall speaking because you have no intentions to interact with your opponent, it's a pretty straightforward deck to play in my experience."
mtgmarketwatch,2v8e1n,fyawm,1 point,Mon Feb 9 03:33:19 2015 UTC,"Everyone is tossing around 'no interaction', but that's not true.  You can tell his decision making changed significantly depending on what his opponent played.  He mid-fetch changed his game plan from primetime to hornet queen.  I don't think many players would have done that (they would've lost).  True he did get lucky :)  But good play gets rewarded with luck.  The deck also folds VERY easily to HD, LD, Aven, Blood Moon and just plain old removal like Path/Terminate.  The trick is not to just power out a Titan, it's to have back up plans.  I don't think it's hard to pilot.  It's hard to WIN with it."

mtgmarketwatch,2v8e1n,GosuMagic,-1,Wed Feb 11 20:39:18 2015 UTC,"I think these are all bad ideas to invest in for two reasons (neither of which are 100% guaranteed, but likely). The Amulet stuff is likely to end up Modern Masters 2017, and/or the deck may have something banned (most likely Summer Bloom) because it may be viewed as a deck that breaks the turn 4 rule/could be seen as unfun/taking too long in the hands of inexperienced players (basically the same reasons as Eggs)."
mtgmarketwatch,2v8e1n,bmemike,5,Sun Feb 8 22:29:53 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that the ""turn 4 rule"" is really ""consistently wins before T4"". I'm not sure that we can call this all that consistent.   There's some validity in taking too long, but I think Cohen's performance was due to a number of factors -- not least of all is his first PT.   I think we'd need to see this deck in the T8 of a few GPs (with the same sort of negative issues cropping up) for bannings to become seriously considered."
mtgmarketwatch,2v8e1n,bmemike,-3,Sun Feb 8 22:46:48 2015 UTC,"This would all be true if Wizards actually studied and made bans based on legitimate reasons, but as we have seen in past (GGT taking so long, DTT ban, BBE going instead of DRS...), Wizards doesn't always make logical decisions."

Is this a long or short position?  What do you want your return to be, and how do you exit when you get there?  At what point do you cut losses?  If it were me, i would find a card that i could get 1 - 4 of in your range.   High value, no risk of repints, plenty of demand to move it.  black border duals and Power."

If someone really has this much to speculate into magic cards they should either just buy collections or just buy cards they need to play the decks they want because they have this kind of cash to throw around.

I used my ~$1000 tax refund and picked up a collection just yesterday 19 duals a Library, survival and other cards equaling ~500-700 dollars.  If speculating I think reserved list cards.

I think splinter twin is set up to be the star of the tournament, but like you said this may be at it's ceiling especially with the expected reprint coming, same with Spellskite that I'm also see a lot of. Just saw humble defector w/ pestermite to draw 4, I'm interested to see if that ends up being a real thing :)"

Mihara plays what he feels like and does well most of the time. I would attribute his success with the deck with his skill, rather than the 75 he sleeves up.  Twin has done well but it seems like infect has the best positioning in day one so far. I wouldn't be surprised to see some price spikes come out of that deck."

All it really takes is a push and I'm sure it could head up to at least $15 if not more, considering foil Swiftspear is $17 and DA was a fairly low supply set imo.  Update 2: Looks like the FNM foil was bought out. The regular remains to be seen.."
mtgmarketwatch,2v09gh,sleeperx,9,Fri Feb 6 18:10:12 2015 UTC,"$100 is a possibility, especially if it has a strong on-camera showing. I plan on getting out at that price since I don't see it going any higher and there is also the threat of a summer set reprint.  Note that she was at least tested in M15, but wasn't released. M16 would be a good set for her (lore-wise as well)."
mtgmarketwatch,2v09gh,nookularboy,3,Fri Feb 6 18:23:31 2015 UTC,Exactly. I'd bet that the reason she was pulled at the last minute from M15 was they didn't want a summer dominated by Black Devotion (which it kinda already was).
mtgmarketwatch,2v09gh,JordanMiller406,5,Fri Feb 6 18:25:44 2015 UTC,"She hit an all time high today, at $86.25. If Junk/Jund wins the PT it will spike over $100, with probably a slow downhill slide as there are no major Modern events for a while."
mtgmarketwatch,2v09gh,JordanMiller406,3,Fri Feb 6 18:15:14 2015 UTC,Depends on how BGx decks do today.  Depends on how many promos enter the market in late April.
mtgmarketwatch,2v09gh,CorpT,2,Fri Feb 6 18:25:34 2015 UTC,Up for short term. Junk decks will cause a spike after this weekend. So sell into the hype.  Long term her price can only go down with the promo re-print and not a lot of people caring about modern for a little while after DC.  Not to mention her being a very strong candidate for M16 as wizards said they wanted to put her in but decided against it at the last minute because of mono black devotion being so strong. That concern is no longer present.
mtgmarketwatch,2v09gh,SlNFUL,2,Fri Feb 6 21:14:34 2015 UTC,"It's an article of faith on this subreddit that she'll be reprinted in Standard, but I don't believe it will ever happen.

Really strong alone, not to mention delve synergy, fits right into a load of decks like dimir control, abzan midrange, BG rock that are already big names in the format.[Citation needed.]  Her sac effect is pretty shit vs tokens though, so maybe weak vs aggro strats like hordeling outburst, rabblemaster etc. But she's so strong vs other midrange decks."
mtgmarketwatch,2v09eq,OctilleryLOL,3,Fri Feb 6 18:09:45 2015 UTC,This is likely a hype response to the Eternal Ghostway deck. Note that MTGO prices started spiking on FRF release. This may be a permanent price change happening if the deck stays.

mtgmarketwatch,2uzklj,Encendi,15,Fri Feb 6 14:48:51 2015 UTC,A) It's hard to spec on formats like Modern where things are already high.  B) Lots of people still play Modern.  You shouldn't rely on your small sample size.  It's probably a small group of people convincing each other that Modern sucks in a big circle jerk.
mtgmarketwatch,2uzklj,CorpT,8,Fri Feb 6 14:52:32 2015 UTC,Just because it's snowing somewhere in the world doesn't mean climate change doesn't want to buy Magic cards.
mtgmarketwatch,2uzklj,willaeon,3,Fri Feb 6 15:34:04 2015 UTC,"Last year when I specced on the Pro Tour it went really well. Like, the 50 copies of Past in Flames I bought doubled, and so did the Grafdigger's Cage. Before this starts to sound like me boasting about myself, let me just be clear about one thing.  I didn't make anything off buylist.  This might sound surprising, but after the Pro Tour, Modern card prices fell and never really recovered. Cards like Past in Flames didn't start recovering until recently, and cards like Grafdigger's Cage hasn't gone anywhere on buylist.  I just feel like the whole hype is overrated. So what if Snapcaster goes from $30 to $50? You're barely going to scratch the surface at $30 on buylist, and good luck trying to sell it at $50 when the price starts trending downward. An example is Rings of Brighthearth. The price has more than doubled from the last time it was talked on this subreddit from $10 to $22, but guess what, buylist is still at $10 because vendors aren't going to throw money at a casual card that can be reprinted at any given time.  If anything, the Pro Tour is a time where cards are hyped, and it's a good time to sell. I'll be trying to upload my playset of Tarmogoyf during this time if there's any hype on this card. Tarmogoyf is either getting banned or reprinted in Modern, it's currently the most played creature in Modern, so if you don't have it, you can literally be priced out of the format.  Save your money, buy into other formats when no one's looking. I am currently targeting FNM Brainstorm, foil Sensei's Divining Top, and foil Stoneforge Mystic. These are Legacy staples, and whether 3DH takes off or not, they will continue go up, and they don't really have upper bounds."
mtgmarketwatch,2uzklj,fyawm,2,Fri Feb 6 16:20:02 2015 UTC,"As I posted in response to a guy who responded to you, I've learned quite a bit from my experience buying cards post banlist update. The biggest thing I've learned is that each day (or even each hour) you wait after a card gets hyped is money lost. So buying 50 Past in Flames right as they spike only to receive them a week later means you probably made little money. The biggest winners are the people who bought those Past in Flames a week earlier and unloaded them quickly as the price shot up. But frankly, the odds are so bad that you'll predict the winning deck that it's not worth it.   Basically, I agree with your assessment and I've personally kept my money in my own long term portfolio. However, I would like to add two things:   One: It's not like you make no money buying cards right before they spike. Perhaps for a legit financier looking to move hundreds or thousands of copies the gain isn't quite enough, but for someone like me who does this to have a nicer dinner or some extra spending money in a while it's not too bad. I sold my GGTs for twice what I bought them and for about 15 minutes of effort I made like $60.   Two: Sometimes these spikes can be price corrections (or the community deludes themselves into thinking they're price corrections, which is the same thing). I would argue that if Snapcaster shot up to $50, it would still be $50 (maybe a little less) by the time my package of them got here and would not drop back down even close to the original price. So in that sense, I'm actually watching format staples and potentially undervalued cards more than interesting cards that could be hyped into the sky."
mtgmarketwatch,2uzklj,fyawm,1 point,Fri Feb 6 17:48:53 2015 UTC,"History will be repeated. People are now touting Past n Flames as one of the go to specs, but really? The prices aren't going anywhere, and even on MTGO the prices aren't as high as last year.  I bought the 50+ Past in Flames weeks in advance, but it's not like you can just upload it. TCG mid prices were $8, but the TCG low prices were $6.00, meaning there is very little money to made selling there. Buylist prices weren't moving, so literally the cards are stuck.  Here's Nick Becvar's tweets that I think best describes the Pro Tour hype.  MTGO is where you really make money during the PT. Buy/sell spreads so thin, and anything that sees play by major team or t8s will move.  IRL isn't that way. Outside of breakout cards, stuff moves some but not enough to make money with buylist spreads, fees when selling, etc.  Im not expecting much in the way of buying stuff in paper from this PT. Maybe a card breaks out (doubt) but prices come back to Earth quick."
mtgmarketwatch,2uzklj,WigginIII,2,Fri Feb 6 18:17:33 2015 UTC,This is why I don't understand why people buylist at all. You're leaving money on the table and are unable to take advantage of spikes.
mtgmarketwatch,2uzklj,fyawm,2,Fri Feb 6 16:34:13 2015 UTC,"Try moving 10 playsets of a sideboard card. Or a card that's falling in price. If you try to sell on TCGPlayer, you're losing on fees, and you can only move a few at a time. Buylist is very much a thing when trying to move more than a few playsets."
mtgmarketwatch,2uzklj,WigginIII,1 point,Fri Feb 6 16:45:42 2015 UTC,"I get large quantities are harder to move, but do you begin to questing why even speccing if you admit that price increases on some cards don't yield price increases in buylists?  I think we target very different things. You look for the obscure, which I find too difficult to move, even on eBay. I focus on standard/modern mainboard cards in tier 2 or better decks. I don't deal in foils at all, let alone FNM promos, legacy, etc. I've got a foil Crop Rotation that expired 3 times when listed as the cheapest available, for example. I've found more success focusing on the areas with the largest markets to move quantity faster."
mtgmarketwatch,2uzklj,GosuMagic,2,Fri Feb 6 17:39:36 2015 UTC,"for moving large amounts like 100+, it's more efficient. Not everyone has time to sell on tcgplayer or ebay."

mtgmarketwatch,2uzklj,GosuMagic,1 point,Fri Feb 6 17:37:04 2015 UTC,"Well, last banlist update I bought 28 Japaneses GGTs and 4 Worldgorger Dragons from 2 different sellers. Both sellers took over a week and a half to ship and I ended up selling the GGTs for $3.8 ea and the Worldgorgers for $4. While I didn't check buylists, I'm pretty sure my sale prices were pretty close.   I'm still glad I sold out of them as soon as they were on hand. Imagine if I tried to sell my cards at whatever the hype price was (like $10 a piece?). My 80% or so profit would turn to 0% by now.  What I learned from that experience is that it's best to speculate on cards that could use a price correction rather than cards that are spiking purely on hype/speculation. If Dredge doesn't perform well at the PT, how easy do you think it'll be for the foil Skaab Ruinator buyers to sell out of their specs? I saw that post when SCG had 15 of them in stock for $2.5 and had them in cart ready to check out but I never pulled the trigger. The only people you're going to sell to at hype prices are suckers who think they're going to make even more money off the card, and frankly, there aren't that many suckers in the MTGFinance game nowadays."

If you're trying to buy a card that's spiking I would say to look for seller feedback and reputation. Don't always go for the absolute lowest prices- a couple cents or even a dollar or two doesn't matter if it's spiking hard and you want to make sure it gets to your place."
mtgmarketwatch,2uzklj,fyawm,1 point,Fri Feb 6 20:37:40 2015 UTC,"they are canceling my orders even before the protour. I bought those last week. Doesn't matter what or where you buy. Once you go into large quantities, stores will cancel your orders. I'm just saying they are more likely to do it on the weekend of a protour. My favorite store to buy from is cardkingdom but they limit my orders to 8 copies."
mtgmarketwatch,2uzklj,SlNFUL,1 point,Fri Feb 6 20:49:53 2015 UTC,"Right, but like I said previously, I'm not going into large quantities and frankly I question those who do, especially if you're in the speculation game.   I don't think you can make a living doing this, or even a good amount of supplemental income. The fact of the matter is, once you go over a certain amount the only way you're going to make profit is by selling to buylists and they aren't nearly as temperamental as prices on eBay or TCGPlayer.   I'll even add to this and say that MTGFinance itself starts getting dangerous once you go over a certain $ amount invested into the game, regardless of what you think the future of Magic is going to be like."

A week later I sold a MP playset for a mere 19.  I've still got 2 more playsets that I decided to hold onto in the event dredge sees more play. My investment was only 1.50 each so I don't mind sitting on them for a while.  But I definitely see a divide between what others buy and what I buy. I dont buy foils. I don't buy foreign language cards. I dont buy FNM promos. I don't touch legacy.  I focus on the areas with the largest customer bases. Standard/modern, any card or playset I can sell for 2.50 I'll do it."

mtgmarketwatch,2uzklj,completefarside,1 point,Fri Feb 6 17:30:18 2015 UTC,"Without trying to get too deep into this, I feel that this is a big mistake when trying to apply logic to WotC's track record on the modern banlist. There have been cards on the banlist that have/had no business being on there. There have been opportunities within design cycles for WotC to address oppressive game mechanics in modern without harming the standard scene. There have been opportunities for WotC to expand the modern playerbase through unbannings, as opposed to bannings.  Remember, the banlist was essentially created from the lists brought to a World Magic Cup team format. While some cards are no-brainers, there is a compelling reason for WotC to become less reactionary in terms of how they approach and market Modern."

mtgmarketwatch,2uvf8m,RoseofThorns,3,Thu Feb 5 14:22:05 2015 UTC,"I think the article presents intangible value in an easily understandable way, so kudos to you for doing that. I often have a lot of trouble explaining this to new players.  However, I do think you could have chosen a better trade example to illustrate your point. There are just so many factors involved that could make the trade swing either way that don't have to deal with intangible value.  Tarmogoyf: Sure, it's THE Modern/Legacy staple, but the card is almost singlehandedly pricing new players out of the format and I think Wizards has a target on it. One way or another, it needs to come down in price and I think if you're not getting a very large amount of play value from it, it's better to wait. Even though I'd say that this is theoretical, it's hard not to give a point in favor of the Goyf trader.    Foil Monastery Mentor: I saw it see a little play in some Modern/Legacy builds, but this is mainly a Standard mythic that still has the prerelease hype price attached. I think even the foil will end up sliding down a good amount along with the regular. A point in favor of the LED trader.   Scalding Tarn: Frankly, I don't think WOTC is going to reprint it in MM15 and even if they do, I doubt it will crash that hard. So in a sense it's a risky hold, but I'd say if you're getting use out of it, it's not too bad, especially since we all saw what price memory has been doing to the prices of new fetches. No points in favor of anyone, maybe slightly favoring the LED trader.  Foil Polluted Delta: We all know about the trajectories of foil land staples. However, they're not exactly quick risers. Slightly favors the Goyf trader.  Lion's Eye Diamond: Here's the real swinger for me. I think the card is underpriced as a Reserved List staple that's played as a 4 of in several Legacy combo decks. Even if the market isn't making a correction right now, I guarantee SCG will likely bump up the price of these when they do their annual Legacy ""price update"" and the rest will follow suit. I think this is a big point in favor of the Goyf trader.   So ultimately I think it's a pretty even trade overall, especially when factoring in the $30 to shore up the ""losses"" from the LED trader. And that's without even factoring in the playtime investment and whatnot."
mtgmarketwatch,2uvf8m,Encendi,0,Thu Feb 5 15:19:56 2015 UTC,"I appreciate your well-throught out and well-written response+feedback. The trade is certainly a pretty complex one, and I should've looked harder for a ""simpler"" trade to illustrate the point better. Something involving normal Standard Siege Rhinos, Flamewake Phoenixes, and nonfoil Fetches, for example. I just grabbed the first ""Rate my trade"" post I could find on the MTGfinance subreddit, and used that.  Other than our disagreement on the ZEN fetch reprints, I think you excellently summarized the trade a lot better than I did."
mtgmarketwatch,2uvf8m,Rock-swarm,4,Thu Feb 5 15:29:45 2015 UTC,"I think that's why your example is so good though; there are oftentimes a bunch of factors that play into making a trade, and it's shortsighted to assume that any given trade is going to maintain it's parity even a month after the trade occurs.   Back when I was getting into legacy, I ended up making a LOT of trades involving Primeval/Grave/Sun titans for legacy staples, depending on which titan was the new ""hotness"" in the standard scene. Titans for confidantes, titans for cabal therapies, titans for ZEN fetches. In the present, I look like a genius for making these trades, and my trade partners look like idiots. But back when those trades were going down, I was actively worried about losing my ability to play the top standard decks at the time, as those titans were winning me earnings through prize support. On top of that, I was ""giving"" a percentage of value to my trading partners because they were ""trading down"" into standard stuff. For at least a year, all of those trades would have been considered a loss in terms of card value. Hindsight is 20/20, but Standard is what keeps most stores in business, not Modern or Legacy, and recognizing the opportunity to make a good trade if it suits your needs is the real lesson that should be taken from your article."

mtgmarketwatch,2uugav,Snow_Regalia,0,Thu Feb 5 14:30:00 2015 UTC,"Certainly makes it less playable than before the bannings.

mtgmarketwatch,2uugav,Snow_Regalia,4,Thu Feb 5 17:20:01 2015 UTC,"First off, I'm not /u/k18b. Secondly, pod was 13% of the paper meta at competitive events. It was also the largest single archetype in the paper meta at competitive events. If that's not a big chunk, then I would like to know what is, in your mind. Third, my personal interest in the card is irrelevant - it's declining price is a result of seeing little play in any top archetype, period. Fourth, the number of fetchlands hasn't varied among the top archetypes. Jund/Junk was running 8 before KTK, as was Scapeshift and Zoo.  But thanks for the downvote!

While I like the idea of responding to someone cracking a Fetchland by casting this, that's not a tournament level play. With Pod gone, I'd expect to see this card drop back to $2 before long, and then go lower."
mtgmarketwatch,2uugav,jensradk,1 point,Thu Feb 5 10:01:33 2015 UTC,"While I agree it isn't going anywhere with pod out of the format, price memory and expanded demand for even lightly played old rares will keep this about where it is at.

However, the first dip is most likely after MTGO redemptions for Fate Reforged starts trickling into the market. Sets are redeemable one month after it is released on MTGO and it takes up to 10 working days for delivery of the redeemed sets. Foils might take a little longer to drop in price as I do imagine foil sets are redeemed less compared with regular sets just because they are significantly more expensive."

mtgmarketwatch,2uow5z,150crawfish,8,Tue Feb 3 23:07:02 2015 UTC,I honestly think both of these will fall in value.  At $7-8 and not in a deck right now I feel like they already have their potential priced into them. A mythic still looking for a deck shouldn't be this high.   I like Shaman a lot more than Hordechief though.
mtgmarketwatch,2uow5z,Theangryhermit,1 point,Wed Feb 4 02:38:22 2015 UTC,"This. Look at Europe where both fall in the $4-5 bracket already. Until they find a home, they're only going to go down (they took a slight bump, bought my chiefs at 2 euros a pop but it's a downwards trend again).  Both cards are solid, but in the current meta their decks are not good enough"
mtgmarketwatch,2uow5z,Naltoc,2,Wed Feb 4 10:44:47 2015 UTC,"I'd wait to move in on them until they hit below $5, which I expect they will at some point. Shaman is a better bet than Hordechief, but I don't like either at their current price."
mtgmarketwatch,2uow5z,yavimaya_eldred,3,Wed Feb 4 06:13:00 2015 UTC,Siege Rhino's all-time high was $10. I wouldn't buy a worse card for $8 hoping it will hit $15
mtgmarketwatch,2uow5z,JasonEAltMTG,4,Wed Feb 4 06:45:21 2015 UTC,"Jason, you're ignoring all of your own previous thoughts in making an explanation that simplistic.   These are single-color middle-set mythics that are very powerful on their own. Sure, they're not siege rhino powerful, but they're incredible powerful, splashable, and harder to get.  Siege Rhino on the other hand is a large set rare with that is being opened with fetchlands basically single-handedly depressing it's price.   I'm not going to spec on them, but it wouldn't hurt to grab a playset if either black or red become good in the future. They won't go down."
mtgmarketwatch,2uow5z,TheRecovery,1 point,Wed Feb 4 17:56:25 2015 UTC,"Both are definitely intriguing (especially Brutal Hordechief, who I think will become a powerhouse as soon as he finds a deck), however the one thing stopping them is the fact that they are in no way Modern playable. Ugin, Monastery Mentor and Soulfire Grand have much more to offer non-Standard formats, and its really only going to take one of them to take off to shift the entire value of Fate  downward.   I do agree with you that the ceiling for these cards is 12-15, which honestly makes them a lousy spec in general - you're talking about less than a 50% growth rate from where you can buy in currently. At the absolute best, one of these cards does show well in coming tournaments, and there's a brief spike (ala Wingmate Roc) before trending back downwards. At the worst, some other card takes off and these guys settle down at the $3-4 range. Somewhere in the between is both cards seeing play, and both spiking a bit, where they will essentially both ""share"" the bump in demand and both end up around $10.  Ultimately, I think it wouldn't hurt to grab a playset if you plan on playing one or both of these cards in the near future. But as far as an actual spec, I don't see either of these worth investing in whatsoever."
mtgmarketwatch,2uow5z,kahluahandcream,1 point,Tue Feb 3 23:20:37 2015 UTC,"I only spec in cards I'll play (for standard) and typically I build decks from draft scraps (UW heroic and BW warriors) because I am a limited player. I pull things for decks and everything else gets traded away for things I need/want.   Given that, I got a playset of hordechief. If it spikes, I'd be willing to trade/sell them off as well as the deck to fund other decks (legacy). If not, I have a great fun deck for me. The shaman though I feel has more to gain.

There probably won't be any break out cards. It will probably be Goyfs all over the place and some Combos that have been consistent.   This isn't Standard, you should have learned this from last year.  Some of the cards may show up on camera and spike but they'll drop down pretty quick after the PT. Maybe you'll make a few bucks.

Faithless looting, grisly salvage, if you run mana dorks Dark Deal. hedron crab is the only one worth running because your opponent can't prevent you from getting a trigger when you cast it.

mtgmarketwatch,2unvgs,Theangryhermit,1 point,Tue Feb 3 18:52:07 2015 UTC,Magus of the Bazaar was a strong part of Standard Dredge so people might try and revisit that deck.

Curious, looking at your post history, you seem to go pretty deep into specs, buyouts, etc. If you wouldn't mind, could you share your approximate annual expenditures on cards? And if relevant, you earnings?  Do you (or are you forced to) report your earnings to the IRS for taxes? Are there ways to receive refunds based on you business expenses?"
mtgmarketwatch,2unnsa,WigginIII,3,Tue Feb 3 22:17:23 2015 UTC,"Well, you should know, I am in my 30s. I have a full time job. This is just something on the side. I noticed mtg was giving me 30 -40% gains. So a few years back, I decided to pull my money out of the stock market because I was only getting about 8%-15%. I estimate I spend somewhere close to $10,000 to $15,000. I just spent $5000 when I was vacationing in Japan 6 months ago. And yes I report all my earnings. MTG is such a hugh market, there is plenty of money to be made."
mtgmarketwatch,2unnsa,GosuMagic,1 point,Wed Feb 4 00:39:49 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your reply.   I'm in my late 20s and also fully employed. I started when some buddies got me into magic and when I learned about how formats like standard worked, it just seemed silly to not maximize ones profit for their cards.   I've been slowly working to gain confidence in my ability to evaluate cards. I've had some hits, and some misses, but I've been more of a ""penny-stock"" investor.   I should keep better records of my expenditures but I've earner over 4k this year in sales. Hoping to make smarter buys in 2015.   Do you recommend a subscription to QS? Do you watch pro tours and GPs or try to evaluate things on your own? And finally, are you also a player of the game?"
mtgmarketwatch,2unnsa,321orez,3,Wed Feb 4 04:37:38 2015 UTC,I can't say I play heavily anymore. I used to play in GP's and PTQs but I just don't have time for it anymore. I will log online and do a draft about once a week. I do follow tournaments to stay up to date on card prices.   I don't use QS but I'm sure they are great. I currently use mtgprice and I even supported their recent kickstarter. I try not to follow too many sources because it could affect my decisions in what to buy. I'm a numbers guy and I follow a certain method I developed that works for me when evaluating cards.  We're getting sidetracked here but you're welcome to msg me privately.
mtgmarketwatch,2unnsa,JasonEAltMTG,3,Wed Feb 4 05:20:18 2015 UTC,Worth noting that there are very few foil copies available on tcgplayer

mtgmarketwatch,2unnsa,Morzas,1 point,Wed Feb 4 06:09:00 2015 UTC,"I was unaware of that. I'll have to admit that I'm on this card due to a mixture of a low buy in price, casual appeal, and potential in modern. However I don't mind moving any foils at the current price, if anyone is willing to buy it, regardless of a potential rise. The card is a low buy in, but if it does not see play this weekend, the card goes nowhere. I also think that today's buyout could create additional hype, almost similar to bloodbraid elfs hype a few weeks ago."
mtgmarketwatch,2unnsa,alblaster,2,Wed Feb 4 06:37:10 2015 UTC,Got two playsets for $8. Low risk.

mtgmarketwatch,2unnsa,callmetwan,1 point,Wed Feb 4 08:54:18 2015 UTC,Nope. This card is pushed on others constantly. I only have a playset because I'm not a believer but I may one day want to play with the card. The best I've ever seen was it played as a 2-of in some pretty jank Dredgevine deck last year with Hedron Crab and this.
mtgmarketwatch,2unnsa,callmetwan,1 point,Wed Feb 4 10:27:55 2015 UTC,"I love the card, and think it is criminally underplayed. It survives most removal in Modern and Legacy, and is a 5/6 flyer with a low downside. I can't tell you how much I want this to work in a Modern MonoBlue Devotion deck.....I recently bought a few foils to mess around with Greg Hatch's MonoBlue Martyr deck, and it is incredible."
mtgmarketwatch,2unnsa,GosuMagic,1 point,Tue Feb 3 23:09:25 2015 UTC,"It survives most removal in Modern and Legacy, and is a 5/6 with a low downside...   I'm not knocking it, but it dies to everything but bolt -in a world with junk decks playing some of the best costed removal this is something that absolutely must be considered. In a dedicated deck paying the exile clause isn't hard but saying it is low downside is really understating the conditions that have to exist for this to work. Post-board your opponents are bringing in graveyard hate which really just shuts this down, I don't know if this is even playable.  I'm not saying it doesn't have its place, that it can't work, but you are making it sound like its a no-brainer to run this and it's not quite that simple."
mtgmarketwatch,2ukf0t,erinnight,10,Mon Feb 2 22:23:29 2015 UTC,It's ridiculous to me that this card hasn't been reprinted in one (or twelve) of the edh precons by now.

mtgmarketwatch,2ukf0t,Asstadon,3,Tue Feb 3 01:25:25 2015 UTC,"I made a thread on this sub predicting significant movement on this card about one month ago...  Here is what I think are the likely reasons:    Older set, smaller print run, rare Lots of casual appeal  Artifact, therefore can be used in any commander deck Unlikely to see reprint in the immediate future, as not really modern relevant, and would be an awkward standard set reprint. Very well suited to the most recent red commander deck."
mtgmarketwatch,2ukf0t,Asstadon,2,Tue Feb 3 02:06:25 2015 UTC,"Note the word ""immediate"". We are almost a year away from the next commander set."
mtgmarketwatch,2ukf0t,JasonEAltMTG,4,Mon Feb 2 23:06:04 2015 UTC,"It is a buyout, justified after the fact by vague mentions of Tiny Leaders hype. Someone trying to sell a copy for $30 doesn't make it so. Sell and don't look back"
mtgmarketwatch,2ukf0t,EsportsLottery,2,Tue Feb 3 08:56:39 2015 UTC,It's a great combo card.  Maybe someone made a modern deck using it or the fact it's in a tier 1 tinyleaders deck?    Here's the tinyleaders deck I'm talking about. http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/28-06-14-tiny/

mtgmarketwatch,2ukf0t,KingoOfChaos,1 point,Tue Feb 3 08:56:09 2015 UTC,"Card has never been reprinted in almost a decade. Colorless, popular (copying Planeswalkers' abilities is attractive) with the casual/EDH/TL crowd, and there were already very few on TCGplayer for the past week or two."

mtgmarketwatch,2ukfjl,willowtree12,3,Mon Feb 2 22:27:24 2015 UTC,"If you look at Vengevine, Geist of St Traft, Batterskull and Griselbrand as comparables, you'll see that they tend to be close to the regular non-foil price. Geist is the only one close to the price of the pack foil. Griselbrand is somewhere in the middle. Lili is on the way up right now, so that may have an impact. I guess in the end it all depends on how many get distributed."
mtgmarketwatch,2ukfjl,ShoePolice,5,Mon Feb 2 22:41:17 2015 UTC,"It may also be relevent that all those cards are alternate art, which may put them at a premium. Lili will have have the same art. So, that may be in its favor of being cheaper...however, there will be a smaller amount of them in circulation opposed to the grand prix promos. The geist had a small print run, but there will be less liliana, right?"
mtgmarketwatch,2ukfjl,Eyams,5,Mon Feb 2 22:53:13 2015 UTC,The difference is that those are GP foils (except geist which is a WMCQ promo) and are handed out to whoever shows up whereas the RPTQ promos require you to win a PPTQ first.
mtgmarketwatch,2ukfjl,Rock-swarm,1 point,Tue Feb 3 00:13:35 2015 UTC,"This. Pretty large discrepancy in terms of supply. The exact number on the market is going to be hard to nail down, but expect numbers along the lines of judge foils.  Secondly, it's important to note that exact art as the first printing will close any significant gap between pack foils and RPTQ foils."
mtgmarketwatch,2ukfjl,worldchrisis,2,Tue Feb 3 13:28:27 2015 UTC,WMCQ Promo Geist is much rarer than any of the GP Promos.
mtgmarketwatch,2ukfjl,GosuMagic,6,Wed Feb 4 15:56:49 2015 UTC,Wotc is looking to reprint liliana of the veil so I'd be careful not to put that much into specing this.

mtgmarketwatch,2ukfjl,gamblekat,-2,Tue Feb 3 16:07:27 2015 UTC,"I don't believe it. First, they're not going to immediately reprint a PTQ promo in an unlimited print run, or what's the point of the promo? Second, none of the comments on Liliana in M15 mention black devotion as a specific problem. That's community speculation. M15 was developed >1 year before Theros was even on shelves, so they couldn't make decisions like that based on meta."

mtgmarketwatch,2ui34f,RoseofThorns,2,Tue Feb 3 04:01:53 2015 UTC,i would let the price dip a little more since FRF just been out for like a week. Plus any other supplement product w/ soulflayer in it would destroy its upside (like herald of  torment and reaper of the wild?)

mtgmarketwatch,2ui34f,GnomGnomGnom,2,Mon Feb 2 10:34:00 2015 UTC,Conley always plays with shitty brewed up decks. That's why he's so great. He'd rather try to make something interesting and unique to him then play the cookie cutter stuff. Really dig his decks and his brew/playstyle.
mtgmarketwatch,2ui34f,KidJustice,3,Mon Feb 2 11:51:43 2015 UTC,yeah def props to him. it is very entertainly to watch something new.  but in general not so good a spec probably :/  cards that rely on other things in general such as soulflayer are traditionally not very good (ie. skaab ruinator)
mtgmarketwatch,2uibti,Syg,1 point,Mon Feb 2 11:54:55 2015 UTC,"It has a big spread because there is no dealer confidence. Which formats will it see play in? A format where foils matter? On MODO?

mtgmarketwatch,2uibti,JasonEAltMTG,1 point,Mon Feb 2 18:21:18 2015 UTC,Redemption is probably the only thing keeping the foil and non-foil price from being almost the same!
mtgmarketwatch,2uibti,dtg99,1 point,Mon Feb 2 18:29:52 2015 UTC,"Soulfire is in an odd place because of it's initial starting price online. No card in the set has seen near as substantial of a drop (~8 tix, ~45%) since the sets release. Bots are likely just being cautious with their buy price as the non-foil price tanks (I can find it for near 8 at goatbots right now). Still, the foil version is actually sold out at goatbots and I can see it was going for ~13. When you factor in the general premium on mythics due to set redemption and the fact that Soulfire saw the 3rd most play out of all FRF cards at SCGWAS (people are trying to make it work) I think that 13 ticket price point is/was very safe; I can see why there aren't any currently in stock for that price."
mtgmarketwatch,2uesod,KidJustice,3,Sun Feb 1 15:00:32 2015 UTC,"Very well thought-out post, great work.  I think one of the only things keeping this in check is that RTR was the first large set in the block and was opened in record-setting fashion. There are many copies available, I still see them all the time in everyone's trade binder. I was hoping they would continue to trend down so I can pick up a few more play sets (I stopped at two play sets when it was Standard legal) but you are right, the environment is ripe for a slight uptick. However I don't see it going up much past the $15 mark."
mtgmarketwatch,2uesod,Mediocritologist,1 point,Sun Feb 1 16:45:04 2015 UTC,"Won't go past $15? Will shock lands go past $15? Surely if Snapcaster from a set only 1 yr older can be $35 at rare which sees less play than Abrupt Decay. Then Abrupt Decay can be $20 in the next 6-12 months.  Decay like Shocks will climb. Except unlike shocks, decay is wanted played in multiple formats as 3-4 of's.  People tell you to invest in shocks. But I'd much rather have an abrupt decay over any of the shocks any day."
mtgmarketwatch,2uesod,Mediocritologist,3,Sun Feb 1 17:10:54 2015 UTC,Well maybe in the long run they can surpass $15. I was speaking in the next year or two though. I hope I'm wrong :)

mtgmarketwatch,2uesod,Carnilawl,1 point,Sun Feb 1 20:15:14 2015 UTC,It seems unlikely to me. But it is possible.  I'm saying that that likelihood is less than the likelihood of AD's obsolescence.

Seems like a lock to appear in Modern Master 2017 though (assuming that is how they keep doing things).  Agree with all your points, but the proviso here IMO is that you should be looking to hold until the end of 2016 at the latest, after that the risk of a price fall due to reprinting rises sharply."
mtgmarketwatch,2uets2,chameleonjunkie,4,Sun Feb 1 15:12:37 2015 UTC,"There's such a small amount of Planechase cards out there I'd say hold. Planechase never really took off in a profitable manner for wizards and the demand isn't really there for more. I'm sure in a year or two you'll be able to find someone who wants to play Planechase  casually, but doesn't want to pay a ridiculous amount for the decks who'd buy a set of them. Only risk is if wizards decides to do a mass re-release or promos. Which again, unlikely.   For my playgroup I actually just made proxies and custom planes because they're so rare to actually find."

There is no way this card doesn't restock given that Khans will keep being drafted, players only need 1 each, and the set has fetchlands to depress the rest of the cards."
mtgmarketwatch,2ubzm5,fyawm,1 point,Sat Jan 31 21:14:02 2015 UTC,"I read somewhere a while ago that the print run of individual foil Mythics roughly correlates to the amount of Legends rares out there (i.e. 20k or so), so while I agree with your statement in terms of a nonfoil assessment, I don't agree with the foil.  Edit: Just found an article on SCG that states that you'd expect to pull a foil Baneslayer in every 121 booster boxes of M10. Old data, but assuming they haven't messed with printing sheet odds too much, that means they're still pretty darn rare even though KTK was print run size is several magnitudes of M10's."
mtgmarketwatch,2ubzm5,mtd14,1 point,Sat Jan 31 23:08:40 2015 UTC,"I guess it makes sense that people are buying out KTK Modern foils now in hopes of performance at the PT, however I feel like even if they perform well they will drop in price. Anafenza has a higher chance of holding thanks to TL hype and mythic rarity, but I don't see the Rhino holding near 20.   My guess is in 3 months Siege Rhino is $10-$12 and Anafenza is $15-$17. I could be wrong, but since that's my guess I'm trying to out my foil Anafenza now for $17-$18."
mtgmarketwatch,2ubzm5,mtd14,1 point,Sat Jan 31 22:11:06 2015 UTC,"Well, if foil Eidolon is $25, I think the Rhino can hover around $20-30. Rhino is a format defining card at the moment.   Anafenza- well I think that she'll see some play, but more importantly there are a lot less of each foil mythic than people tend to think. SCG wrote an article of the odds of pulling a foil Baneslayer back in M10 (I know, old data- but proportionally still relevant) as 1 in every 121 booster boxes or in other words, 4356 booster packs."
mtgmarketwatch,2ubzm5,mtd14,2,Sat Jan 31 23:12:03 2015 UTC,Eidolon was opened around 2 months as a 1 of in a set that likely wasn't heavily redeemed for foils via MODO. Siege Rhino will be opened around 3 months as a 3 of and 2 months as a 2 of in a set that is very heavily redeemed for foils via MODO. Similar in regards to Anafenza.

mtgmarketwatch,2u7f38,IgoRStripes,6,Fri Jan 30 20:21:47 2015 UTC,"I agree with your picks (except for maybe Courser... I could see that being better to ditch and rebuy possibly after rotation). Nykthos will be an EDH land for sure (especially as it does do a relatively decent job at acting like Gaea's cradle in some decks, and is a budget replacement). The temples, I'm not entirely sure about though. Ultimately, I don't foresee them holding values similar to what they are in Standard. I see them settling around $1-2 or so ($2 for the ones that are most used, and that may see one-of modern play).   As for other cards, Eidolon of the Great Revel is a keeper. Mana Confluence is a keeper, but it may be best to move out of them and then back in. The Gods are definitely worth holding onto for EDH appeal (especially those that are cheap right now). The same can possibly be said about the Souls from M15. Barring reprints, they should creep up a bit overtime. Rabblemaster has seen some eternal play, but will likely drop. The same can be said about Caryatid (Ascendancy decks may still go the Caryatid route). Planeswalkers tend to hold some value, but if it's being propped by Standard, it may be better to rebuy into those (i.e. Nissa)."
mtgmarketwatch,2u7f38,armitage2112,1 point,Fri Jan 30 16:45:57 2015 UTC,"I did thankfully manage to unload the two Nissa I had when they were still $40, just after they started to drop. I also unloaded my Rabblemaster playsets, for 18 on MTGO and about 15 in paper. Pucatrade is great for getting value on some things.  I do also have a playset of Confluence, not sure if it's worth outing to rebuy given that they are only about $11 right now. I got those when JOU came out at about $8 value. At this point, I'll trade them if the opportunity is offered, but I think they are not worth buylisting to rebuy.  I might have to grab some souls as well as some of the gods I am light on atm. Almost all of them make fair EDH generals."
mtgmarketwatch,2u7f38,yavimaya_eldred,2,Fri Jan 30 17:26:35 2015 UTC,I can't imagine most of the gods being bad keeps.
mtgmarketwatch,2u7f38,Mediocritologist,2,Fri Jan 30 16:24:04 2015 UTC,"Tymaret is a card worth hanging onto. It's bulk now but has some EDH/TL appeal and is fringe Modern playable. No risk sitting on those.   Fate Unraveler is a Nekusar card, so it should also gain some value eventually.   Spirit of the Labyrinth is a Death & Taxes card and should stay out of bulk range down the road.   Dictate of Erebos is a slam dunk. It's better than Grave Pact in most scenarios while having only one printing, and Grave Pact is still a $10 card despite multiple printings. All the dictates have casual appeal (especially foils) but DoE is the best one by far.   Prophetic Flamespeaker is an odd one, it's almost a bulk mythic but has a very powerful effect and has seen some fringe modern play. A mythic that cheap and that close to being playable seems worth holding.   Hydras are always good casual specs. Nessian Wilds Ravager and Mistcutter Hydra aren't very appealing casually but Heroes' Bane and Broodmaster should be worth a couple bucks down the road despite having promo printings. Foils are the target there.   Prophet of Kruphix is pretty obvious. Especially foils. Karametra's Acolyte foils too."
mtgmarketwatch,2u7f38,yavimaya_eldred,2,Fri Jan 30 19:34:18 2015 UTC,"Agreed on Dictate of Erebos and Prophet of Kruphix especially. I've been bullish on foil copies. Also I might add Ashen Rider. It's a mythic that has seen some play in Legacy sideboards and being so cheap at the moment, it's mostly zero risk to hold your copies or acquire new ones. It basically replaced Angel Of Despair and that card was about $8 last time I checked."

But it may not get that much lower. It could even see a small increase if a mono color deck sees major play. That just seems unlikely with khans supporting Tricolor so well.

mtgmarketwatch,2u69a8,KidJustice,1 point,Fri Jan 30 19:49:26 2015 UTC,"Nykthos is still valuable in 3 color decks depending on how the colors are balanced and is ludicrous in mono- and 2-color decks. Lantern is at it's best in 5 color decks. It's obviously still good in 3 color decks but has heavy competition with signets, Relic, Ingot, Talismans, an the like. As someone who builds decks habitually, I find myself putting Nykthos in far more decks than Lantern.   This is basically nitpicking but I feel it's part of the equation when evaluating cards like this."
mtgmarketwatch,2u69a8,Chosler88,1 point,Fri Jan 30 20:03:39 2015 UTC,"Perhaps, but if we're using anecdotal evidence among the 30-40 decks in my playgroup one is mono color since we all find them less fun to build/play. Zero multicolor run Nykthos because they don't have the ability to get enough permanents down for it to be worth it because board wipes are a commonplace in EDH. I'm sure you can design a deck to be multi-color and run Nykthos, just doesn't seem to come up.

Still seems like a weird card to get. I imagine prices go down on all theros block stuff in a few months. How high is this going to go in order to make a profit after fees or buylist? Jason mentioned the spread was 2% almost a week ago but every reputable merchant buylisting I saw had it no higher than $1.45 at the time.  I have to check how much it would cost to buy. I imagine $2 something after shipping. It trades at $3.   The problem with mtg.gg is it has/had some garbage buylist merchants like Strikezone on it last I checked.  So I ask, why pick up Nykthos when I can trade for Pact of Negation for $10-11 and buylist it at $9?"
mtgmarketwatch,2u69a8,KidJustice,1 point,Fri Jan 30 06:59:15 2015 UTC,"MTG.GG does not list strikezone. The main ones are ABU, AdeventuresOn, T&T, Card Kingdom (and I think that's it?). At the least, I've buylisted to all 4 of those from mtg.gg to satisfactory results."

I think I just didn't like the format on how to buylist or I heard they were too harsh on grading. Not sure tbh but for some reason I have yet to buylist to them. Same reason why I don't buylist to SCG. Feels like a hassle, although I had read Ben said he was going to work on buylisting in 2015 for SCG. Hopefully those changes arrive soon."

mtgmarketwatch,2u5yjn,roseffin,2,Fri Jan 30 05:53:58 2015 UTC,I know that American card shops use European buyers as proxies to get cards from MCM. So I do not think that direct buying from States is allowed.

IIRC the sum of the article was that it is good for buyers but bad for sellers.

mtgmarketwatch,2u0sd5,mtgspotter,9,Wed Jan 28 23:43:50 2015 UTC,I seriously doubt this is due to the actual popularity of tiny leaders but instead a bunch of speculators rushing to try and be ahead of a new market.   I don't think a bunch of people are trying to build an all foil Ezuri deck today. This spec and the many others may get there eventually though.   This could be the mtg finance community killing a golden goose. The EDH fad breathed life into a whole chunk of inventory. This could do the same to a bunch of cards but if the first thing people see is the general they want to build around is a $50 foil they probably won't even try.
mtgmarketwatch,2u0sd5,Theangryhermit,3,Thu Jan 29 14:03:59 2015 UTC,"That's not true at all, you're assuming anybody that wants to play EDH/Tiny Leaders is only going to want to foil out their commander.   Ezuri can be had for as low as $0.43 on TCG low, and is in the precon green commander deck."
mtgmarketwatch,2u0sd5,C_Terror,2,Thu Jan 29 15:24:00 2015 UTC,"It's not literally true but I think the format needs some breathing room. Some cards have to get in the hands of players to actually become staples first.  I think keeping this format in mind when trading is smart. Participating in buyouts for cards that are going to be ""future"" staples is dangerous."
mtgmarketwatch,2u0sd5,Theangryhermit,2,Fri Jan 30 00:52:23 2015 UTC,Eh.. I doubt there are that many people who would refuse to build a deck unless they could foil it out for cheap. I'm sure they exist but probably not in great enough numbers to stifle the potential growth of a format. I do agree it's a speculative buyout though.

Prime Speaker Zenega was $15 foiled and like $2 non-foil for the longest time. No reason why Anafenza should be $5 non-foil and $10 foil.

mtgmarketwatch,2u0sd5,KidJustice,1 point,Thu Jan 29 16:17:35 2015 UTC,"I disagree. It's currently in print, meaning there will be a glut of copies. Tiny Leaders is too small currently to have much of an effect on newer cards imo. Good targets are older cards that don't have such a large supply."
mtgmarketwatch,2u0sd5,Gordonuts,2,Thu Jan 29 16:21:16 2015 UTC,"There are 11 sellers for Foil Anafenza(tcgplayer). It's a mythic w/ a 2x multiplier that sees play in Commander and Tiny leaders. That's pretty much unheard of considering most Mythic Foils that are commanders have 5x-10x Multipliers. It's one of the best commanders in French EDH and one of the better ones in Tiny Leaders. Non-foil is $4-5. Not sure how it can get lower than $9. There won't be that many more foils being opened. If it were a rare I'd agree, but its not.  It also has a possibility of seeing modern play. Although I think Doran may be better."
mtgmarketwatch,2u0sd5,KidJustice,1 point,Thu Jan 29 16:31:01 2015 UTC,"Hmm, yeah $9 is probably low, didn't realize it was that cheap. I still can't see it jumping a ton in the near future (not to the degree we're seeing these other foil commanders jump) since there are still copies entering circulation, plus MtG is at an all time high popularity-wise... Despite being a mythic there are relatively a lot of copies out there."

mtgmarketwatch,2u0sd5,GrossoGGO,1 point,Thu Jan 29 16:14:31 2015 UTC,"At least initially, one of the main appeals of the format as I see it is that it is pretty cheap to get into. Because of that, I don't think the Legends Legends will do much any time soon , but I've been wrong before. $30+ is pretty high for a commander, but if a lot of people get really invested in the format then who knows?"

mtgmarketwatch,2u0sd5,GrossoGGO,1 point,Thu Jan 29 18:18:26 2015 UTC,"Not entirely sure. Changes in the point values of cards seem to be correlated with changes on TCGplayer, but I haven't figured out if there are rules that govern when values are changed on pucatrade. I do know that you can sometimes get cards really cheap shortly after spikes."
mtgmarketwatch,2u0sd5,joedud1,0,Thu Jan 29 18:39:05 2015 UTC,It also seems like people put lots of cards on their want list before the spike is updated in the point value and if you start to send a card after the points are updated your trader will try to cancel because he didn't want it after the point value jumped.
mtgmarketwatch,2u0sd5,The_Happening2014,2,Thu Jan 29 19:50:25 2015 UTC,"Doesn't matter if they try to cancel. Once a card is put on the list of Wants and you confirm to send it, they have to pay you however many points the card is currently worth.

The real key to making money is to be ahead of the curve, not chasing the spike.   IMO, the only reason to buy cards during a spike is if you need them to play with. No one is going to get a playset Worldgorger Dragon for $4 (or less) again for a good while.  Good luck with making your money, but short selling cards you don't have is asking for trouble."

The people buying from you may be speccing and you stand to get bad feedback if you ship 2 weeks later.  The alternative is you don't get the cards you buy or they are not in the correct condition, in which case you need to cancel your sales or go out and buy the card elsewhere (usually at a loss)  I've seen people do it, but personally for me the risk is too high and the hassle is too much."

mtgmarketwatch,2txtlb,KidJustice,1 point,Wed Jan 28 07:16:42 2015 UTC,"Short (finance):       In finance, short selling (also known as shorting or going short) is the practice of selling securities or other financial instruments that are not currently owned, and subsequently repurchasing them (""covering""). In the event of an interim price decline, the short seller will profit, since the cost of (re)purchase will be less than the proceeds which were received upon the initial (short) sale. Conversely, the short position will be closed out at a loss in the event that the price of a shorted instrument should rise prior to repurchase. The potential loss on a short sale is theoretically unlimited in the event of an unlimited rise in the price of the instrument, however in practice the short seller will be required to post margin or collateral to cover losses, and any inability to do so on a timely basis would cause its broker or counterparty to liquidate the position. In the securities markets, the seller generally must borrow the securities in order to effect delivery in the short sale. In some cases, the short seller must pay a fee to borrow the securities and must additionally reimburse the lender for cash returns the lender would have received had the securities not been loaned out. Historically, short selling is going against the upward trend of the stock market.

mtgmarketwatch,2txtlb,stitches_extra,1 point,Wed Jan 28 17:34:05 2015 UTC,I think it's sketchy if acquiring the cards will end up delaying the shipping beyond what would normally be expected. There's really no advantage to the buyer of your listing cards like this.
mtgmarketwatch,2txtlb,mtg_liebestod,1 point,Wed Jan 28 13:57:18 2015 UTC,Whatever marginal profits I could make do not make up for the loss of credibility and trust if I cannot fulfill the order.  Or the loss I would take in having to buy cards from a LGS (assuming they have them in stock which is unlikely in a spike scenario) to fulfill the contract.  Too much risk. Too shady. Not going to do it.  Focus on the profits you did make - not the profits you theoretically could have made had the stars aligned.
mtgmarketwatch,2txtlb,jmarsh642,0,Wed Jan 28 22:14:04 2015 UTC,"Happens a lot. Went on a bit of a buying spree after the banlist announcement, buying up what I needed to foil out modern infect, and a bunch of foil sideboard cards for Junk, i.e. Kor Firewalker, Timely Reinforcements, Golgari Charms, etc. I also had a playset of foil BBE's coming from speculating on the pre-ban rumors in modern.  Of those orders, I've had condition issues, delivery issues, and out-of-stock issues. The condition issues bug me the most when I'm ordering foils, since it's almost never worth the hassle of mailing them back to the store. So they offer the partial refund, and I leave them negative feedback. About half the time, the stores have blocked me from further purchases from them (3 total now). It's just a numbers game to them. Of all the online sales they do, X% will actually do something if the cards aren't as advertised. Of that number, Y% will still leave negative feedback as a reflection of the poor service. As long as they can keep their overall feedback rating above the Gold Star seller rating, they don't really suffer from a loss of business aside from customers they've already lost.  It takes a truly large number of poor sales experiences for a retailer to lose online business due to reputation issues. White Lion Games is the last one I've heard of that had a bit of a hate-train going for it, alongside Strikezone Online for buylisting issues. But that's about it."
mtgmarketwatch,2tuz4t,Zebo91,3,Tue Jan 27 17:33:43 2015 UTC,"Entirely dependent on what else is in the deck. Jace v vraska had $10 remand, so everything else is worth less. If elspeth and Kiora are the best cards they could be $8-15 each. If they put in serum visions or path to exile that number is lower. If they put in cryptic those walkers will be worth a quarter."
mtgmarketwatch,2tuz4t,jimini-christmas,1 point,Tue Jan 27 17:59:26 2015 UTC,HA one can only dream.. probably gonna put in shitty cards with 1 or 2 money cards
mtgmarketwatch,2tuz4t,mewcuss,3,Wed Jan 28 01:33:17 2015 UTC,"Print runs for these decks are really high, especially when they feature planeswalkers.  Izzet vs. Golgari are still available on Amazon even after the GGT unbanning, and even then it's only $10 more than Jace vs Vraska(which is still widely available at $20, and contains remand which holds the majority of the value of the contents).  Granted, Izzet vs. Golgari didn't feature planeswalkers, but Jarad and Niv Mizzet are around $2 each, and so are Jace and Vraska.  On release of J v V, Vraska dropped 50% to $2.50, and Jace took an even bigger nosedive from around $10 to $2.   Given that, I'd say the non-foil pack and duel deck versions of these cards will land between $2-$3 if there are any other chase rares/uncommons in the box, and at a best case(no good reprints), they'll land at $5-$6(Nicol Bolas, Ajani, Venser) .  If you're looking to spec at all these are generally a bad idea.  The chase cards in these sets are generally a bad idea.  The value in the packs reaches equilibrium very quickly because of the availability.  tl;dr, they will land somewhere between $2 and $7, exactly where depending on the contents of the box."
mtgmarketwatch,2tuz4t,Lollipopsaurus,2,Tue Jan 27 20:04:28 2015 UTC,"When wizards announced the deck lists, well after they announced the deck, Jace was at $19.22 median. When it came out on March 14th, it was at $16.57. $10 at the end of April. $5 in July.  Following then same pattern, Vraska is: &$7.39, $6.99, half price in August and never went down to 75%. (Is actually worth slightly more than Jace)  Both Jace and Vraska were from the same large, first, set; while Elspeth and Kiora are from a large first and small second respectively. I would wager the two ladies see more play than jace and the gorgon did during their time. I would not expect the prices for these to drop significantly,  at least not until we get closer to rotation."
mtgmarketwatch,2tuz4t,ItsDanimal,1 point,Wed Jan 28 05:56:25 2015 UTC,So it seems that kiora/elspbeth wouldnt see much chance at increasing valueafter the price drop for a long time since the boxes stay in production for a while?
mtgmarketwatch,2tuz4t,Lollipopsaurus,2,Tue Jan 27 20:24:11 2015 UTC,"Are you asking if their prices will go up after a long time?  There's no reason any duel deck planeswalker should ever get over $10 unless they're reprinted in standard or some other miracle happens.  Otherwise, planeswalkers are rarely used in any format outside of standard except EDH and a few are sometimes relevant in legacy."

mtgmarketwatch,2tuplz,gamblekat,2,Tue Jan 27 18:50:44 2015 UTC,"Ugin is one of those cards that will retain and increase in value because of the diversified appeal it has. Not particularly great in most formats, but will be played in standard, modern and legacy. Popular in EDH.  So while it will soon lose value due to FRF hype, you could expect it to eventually become a casual chase."

There are no cards from theros block that are $30 today. The only ones that are worth more than 15 are elspeth, thoughtsieze, and brimaz. Ts and the cat king are legacy quality. Elspeth is the best walker in edh. Elspeth also has a reprint on the way, which will likely be the fate of Ugin as well.   It'll take a miracle for this card to maintain a $15 price point long term."

mtgmarketwatch,2tuq95,ItsaJackle,6,Tue Jan 27 16:29:19 2015 UTC,I see two decent options:  Sell now - Supply is only going to grow and the ceiling for standard foils is lower.   Wait to see what happens during the upcoming modern pro tour and sell after that - this is basically a bet that Tasigur will put up some good results there.

mtgmarketwatch,2ts1xp,myemfar,4,Mon Jan 26 23:43:34 2015 UTC,7 printing to 4 printing should be a factor.
mtgmarketwatch,2ts1xp,wumagic,2,Tue Jan 27 00:17:23 2015 UTC,Can you explain?
mtgmarketwatch,2ts1xp,Zebo91,6,Tue Jan 27 01:39:25 2015 UTC,"Enemy pain lands have few printings (4 [http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=383302 ]), where as allied ones have 6 (7 if reprinted [http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=129458 ]), meaning that the supply on the allied pain lands is larger. Because of this, there is less potential for a huge spike, although they will still go up quite a bit if reintroduced into standard."
mtgmarketwatch,2ts1xp,davekayaus,3,Tue Jan 27 02:19:26 2015 UTC,"Also bear in mind that these lands have setting-specific names (e.g. Adarkar Wastes) and so won't be printed outside of a Core Set or expansion.

mtgmarketwatch,2tqdve,uargaroth,6,Mon Jan 26 21:25:58 2015 UTC,It was the highlight card of SCG DC. The majority of matches on camera ran it and allowed for really quick Ugins and Garruks. A lot of people are focusing on Tasigur but across both days no new card was used more than Frontier Siege (maybe Ugin).
mtgmarketwatch,2tqdve,Trainer_PAC,2,Mon Jan 26 21:51:15 2015 UTC,I think most people just skimmed the text and thought it produced 2 mama instead of 4.  Now an over-correction.

mtgmarketwatch,2tow05,MootBear,3,Mon Jan 26 04:42:15 2015 UTC,"The way I see it this is about demand.  True-Name stole his Legacy appeal and caused GoST to drop pretty low last year with the promo and what not.  GoST is finally rising off of a historical low point and it is likely that post ban GoST (because of Modern demand) ends up some where close to $25 again.  Players can be most confident they won't get mamed by another reprint and it won't be in MMA2.    It has a lot going for it in casual formats too, for example Tiny Leaders.  There have been a good many words written about GoST as of the B&r update and that has probably stirred up some new demand.  I am pretty high on GoST as a format defining card for Modern.  It can certainly go higher or lower commensurate to the amount of play/airtime it sees at the pro-tour.  Pro players don't like playing untested decks in a new format as good cards are good and so on.  I will be keeping a close eye on the the price since I finished my set a few months back on the cheap."
mtgmarketwatch,2tow05,Red_Beam,2,Mon Jan 26 06:55:47 2015 UTC,"Allow me to play Devil's advocate.  GoST can be pretty awful in the current Modern meta. Lots of cards, Tarmogoyf, Tasigur, Siege Rhino, and Liliana of the Veil, are great against it. Tron is playing Pyroclasm, Zoo is doing Zoo, it's pretty easy to stop a 2/2 that doesn't have Path to Exile backup. GoST has also been forced out of legacy. True-Name took its spot. I don't think it'll ever return to the $30 of its glory days.  The only place it has is Tiny Leaders, which is a legitimate argument because it's one of the best generals.. However, I don't know if it'll stay in Tiny Leaders. It's a non-interactive general in a format where you can only play 1 of answers, I would have to wonder if it's on the watchlist for potential bans."
mtgmarketwatch,2tow05,fyawm,4,Mon Jan 26 16:19:55 2015 UTC,The modern GP in DC in 2 weeks will be a chance to see what decks are getting played. That will give you sense of the new meta. Although that weekend will probably cause a lot of spikes and/or drops. Will be super important to keep as up to date as possible.   I had the chance to pick up 8x copies for 14 each and didn't pull the trigger and I might regret it. I do already have one playset tho.

mtgmarketwatch,2tnwnz,Snake973,1 point,Tue Jan 27 02:22:51 2015 UTC,"I've been wondering if Tasigur is this sets courser of kruphix, seen as good, but perhaps underestimated how powerful he can be.   With delve we can control what's in our GY for his ability. He's a low commitment with only 1b so splashable in the many decks that run black. He also has modern implications.   His only drawback is that he's legendary, so it makes it somewhat less likely to be a 4 of, although sidisi is seeing play as a 4 of.   I picked up 2x playsets for 4.30 each mostly to play and 1 set to invest."
mtgmarketwatch,2tnwnz,WigginIII,1 point,Sun Jan 25 23:47:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah good pick up and we'll certainly see where he ends up on the power level. I'm curious if Fabiano is going to be moving them to the main, or keeping them in the side since financially that would make a big difference."

The only issue is that he is very difficult to run as any more than a 2 of. A three of is fine, but your second in hand is mostly dead, and if it is milled, it is also a waste of your 4 mana.   I got my playset for $5 each delivered in austalia (our prices here suck).  That  being said, I cannot see it getting to courser of kruphix prices, if just for the fact that it isn't ever going to be played as more than a 2 of and very rarely as 3-of. There is just not the same level of demand as when courser was being jammed into every single deck.  This feels lie the hype, and if you got them cheap, you should be selling into it"

mtgmarketwatch,2tnwnz,Rock-swarm,1 point,Mon Jan 26 01:59:56 2015 UTC,"In his specific deck, they stay in the side because the idea is to blank an opponent's game 1 removal, then punish the opponent for siding out things like chained to the rocks or murderous cut.  With that said, that list is clearly just a pile of cards, in the sense that it can move in almost any direction. Maybe it ends up being a true control deck, maybe it ends up moving more towards a midrange game. It's current incarnation is ovbiously geared towards beating RG midrange and Jeskai tokens."
mtgmarketwatch,2tnwnz,minutehourday,1 point,Mon Jan 26 00:58:58 2015 UTC,"Tasigur is like Sidisi in that he's low cost (with delve) and if he sticks, you're probably winning the game, such that a dead one in hand is not a big deal.  Compare that to Brimaz in this standard - still a very powerful card, but he needs to attack/block to gain advantage and he gets quickly outclassed by rhino, butcher, etc.  He's not guaranteed to be a 4 of, but it wouldn't surprise me if he was in decks with heavy graveyard themes.  In the more standard midrange/control decks, I do agree he's probably more of a 2-3 of (sideboard or main)."
mtgmarketwatch,2tnwnz,Sniffygull,1 point,Mon Jan 26 01:40:38 2015 UTC,"I got the three I need for my modern deck. And if my LGS still has him at five tomorrow I'm gonna get a set or two.   I think he's a really strong body both for Sultai, and U/B control which is something they've been lacking. And his showing face in modern is more or less a certainty, he's akin to a Bizarro Goyf. And can come out turn two with several different card combinations.   I'd say if you can find them at cost of 5 or lower or trade for them in that rage picking a few up isn't a bad idea. As a large scale, let me buy fifty of him investment I'd say no.  That said Soulfire Grand Master is dropping so maybe skip him and get her. She's more or less a shoe in to break something."

mtgmarketwatch,2tk4kl,mtd14,2,Sat Jan 24 23:01:14 2015 UTC,I'm seeing a LOT of Eidolon of Blossoms on camera. This could be people just starting off the FRF Standard with a safe deck like GB Constellation but even outside of it (like in Temur Ascendancy.dek) it's making appearances. At $1 each ($2 for the buy-a-box promo) there's not really much risk of going in on a set or two.
mtgmarketwatch,2tk4kl,The_Happening2014,2,Sat Jan 24 23:14:37 2015 UTC,"I don't know about this one. My gut tells me that if it currently sees a moderate amount of play and is <$1, seeing a bit more play isn't going to move the price enough to profit.   I definitely see the logic, but with $0.60 in shipping and $.50 + 11% fees, I would need to buy a playset to go from $3.65 to $5.25 just to break even. In my book, unless we see a huge meta shift the cap is $2/copy, so the max upside is [ 8 * .89 - .6 - .5 - 3.65] $2.40/playset and the max downside at $.50/copy is [2 * .89 - .6 - .5 - 3.65] -$2.97/playset. So probably an okay risk to take trading, where you don't have those fees but not worth involving cash."

mtgmarketwatch,2tezyz,chrisrazor,7,Fri Jan 23 16:34:24 2015 UTC,I think you can use basic finance logic here: sell into hype. There's a lot of hype propping the value up right now. What will it be worth in 2 years? I have no idea. But I don't think you'll ever be sad selling it for $100.

At my lgs someone traded one for full sets of all Khans fetches. People value them high and being able to get actual liquid stock as opposed to cash may work out better for you in the long run. That said selling at 100-120 and re-investing half is also a good deal. Considering that you got the Ugin for ""Free."""

In the short term they will drop as hype dies, but down the road you'll see them going for much more.""  This is a similar situation to many high-value promos and foils.  As hype dies they drop, but over time demand will build up and they'll rise even higher.  Dump them now, pick them up in a year if you really want one."

I also have limited knowledge on the subject so I am looking to hear all opinions.  In the spirit of discussion I ask you, based on what?  Is it better than Karn (the other planeswalker I have seen it compared to for playability)?  Is it better than the pack foil version?  Time will tell of course, but with all the hype and limited speculation, I would think this is a sell at 100.  It's cool, it's rare, but the risk seems to outweigh the reward.  JTMS is only $100 and it seems to be regarded as the best planeswalker ever printed.  I've seen more people at my locals wanting the foil over the promo.  Ebay is pushing the price to the high $90s, but it's still hype time."
mtgmarketwatch,2tezyz,Rock-swarm,2,Fri Jan 23 17:28:51 2015 UTC,"You could argue that alt art Ugin will be as rare as a judge promo Elesh Norn or full art Mutavault.  I'm not taking a second mortgage out to stock up on Ugin's, but the rarity definitely gives it potential to go pretty high."
mtgmarketwatch,2tezyz,jimini-christmas,0,Fri Jan 23 18:06:09 2015 UTC,"That's the thing, though - it's really not that rare. Assume that premiere level stores cracked 3-5 alt-art ugins, and the fact that unopened Ugin's fate packs are being turned into FNM prizes over the next month, and you actually have a pretty good supply going. Definitely higher than Judge foil numbers, and absolutely higher than full-art mutavault or Book Jace numbers.  Ugin himself doesn't have a proven track record in terms of playability, and that's going to play a significant factor as well."
mtgmarketwatch,2tezyz,GrossoGGO,1 point,Fri Jan 23 18:28:33 2015 UTC,. Is it just your store using Alt-art packs as FNM prizing or was this something mandated by Wotc?  I know a LGS that just cracked all his leftover packs for the store.

mtgmarketwatch,2tezyz,davekayaus,2,Fri Jan 23 18:40:34 2015 UTC,but karn went up because tron became a deck in modern. Modern wasn't a thing when karn was in standard.   Being a 4 of in a respectable deck tends to increase the price of mythics that were printed printed prior to that decks success.

mtgmarketwatch,2tf15q,Sniffygull,1 point,Sat Jan 24 04:06:55 2015 UTC,"Only unload for things you know you can turn around for higher value right away. Otherwise just hold them. Fetches will ""always"" go up. If you're not using them and have things you want for a deck sure do that, but their inherent value is much higher than anything else you'll probably end up with. Only decent bets I'd say would be fetches for Monastery Mentor and a few other things that should jump with a good showing at the next big event. And that's only short term flip immediately investing."
mtgmarketwatch,2tf15q,Lollipopsaurus,1 point,Fri Jan 23 20:42:11 2015 UTC,"I would guess that most modern, legacy, and standard players have play sets of non-foils by now, and you'll only see these (slightly) drop in the next few months, similar to Shocklands from the RTR block."
mtgmarketwatch,2tf15q,Bigbadbear888,1 point,Fri Jan 23 20:50:09 2015 UTC,"At the moment I would trade them into shocklands.  Shocks are beginning to show signs of significant, long-term gain. RtR Steam ents is already up to $13, and the Guildpact version has climbed to over $17.  If you want to hold fetches long term, trade the shocks you've been holding into fetches when they rotate.  Hopefully by then they'll be pretty close to the same price; Steam Vents only needs $4 to catch up with Polluted Delta, and is already more than the red KTK fetches."
mtgmarketwatch,2tdz2i,gamblekat,6,Fri Jan 23 09:02:37 2015 UTC,"People tend to forget the purpose of Modern Masters. It doesn't significantly increase supply. It's not to lower prices of modern stapes. It's there to make Wizards money, and generate interest in the Modern format. They stand to make a lot of money selling these sets for people to draft and have fun with. And they want to get people looking into modern by introducing it to them at their regular draft events. But they definitely aren't trying to make modern more accessible using any tools except standard legal reprints.  Point is, MM2 won't do much for Goyf's price. It will generate some amount of interest in the format, and that might even up the price a bit, as it did significantly with MM1 (difference being that this time a higher percentage of players who would be interested in entering the format already have). But Goyf isn't dropping until he sees an actual reprint in an unlimited print run.  EDIT: Aside: Goyf won't be printed in standard any time soon I don't think. It'd be such a bonkers good card in standard right now with both Thoughtseize and fetch lands legal. One or both of those need to rotate before Goyf has a chance of not being totally OP. And on top of that, Liliana of the Veil is expected to be reprinted in M16, pushing Goyf's potential reprint back another 6 months."
mtgmarketwatch,2tdz2i,ElvishJerricco,1 point,Fri Jan 23 16:27:44 2015 UTC,"I agree, especially with the recent example of Thoughtseize. Even at rare in an unlimited print run of a set that sold very well it's remained a solidly $15+ card and has been trending straight back up since going out of print again.   I can't see Goyf as a mythic coming down to less than $50 even if it was reprinted in an unlimited run set, and it's the kind of card they might not ever consider appropriate to reprint in standard. Certainly not any Standard with fetches, which covers at least the next 1.5 years. (Longer, if Zendikar fetches are reprinted in a later block)"
mtgmarketwatch,2tdz2i,EsportsLottery,9,Fri Jan 23 17:54:14 2015 UTC,It's very realistic to expect goyf to be in MM2015 if they expect to sell it at $10 a pack.  Just estimate the EV of the cards needed to hit that price and it's a pretty big indicator Goyf will be in the set.     Then I guess it just depends on print run and everything but I wouldn't expect Goyf to drop from MM2 in particular considering how much it went up after MM1.  The price might come down after it's announced though.    Keep in mind they printed Modern masters with goyf at $100 to increase availability.  I don't think they are scared of denting a $200 price tag so there is no way it's left out of Modern Masters 2 unless they have other plans to reprint it in a different upcoming product.      IMO I wouldn't expect it to be a good spec right now at this price.  You might spec on it after a MM2015 announcement or spoiler but it depends on how much MM2015 gets printed which isn't known.  I don't think it's a great spec target right this instant.     At $200 it seems priced out of most demand that would normally go up from fetches and everything else being cheaper.
mtgmarketwatch,2tdz2i,KidJustice,4,Fri Jan 23 09:32:54 2015 UTC,"Don't think they need Goyf. If MM15 has Elesh Norn, Iona,Eldrazi,Noble,Linvala,Mox Opal,Phyrexian Obliterator,fulminator mage,bitterblossom,Grove of the Burn Willows, Horizon Canopy,damnation,azusa, scapeshift,Karn,Filter lands/fetches,etc. These are all $20-$50 cards.  How many $25+ cards were in MMA? Vclique, Cryptic, Bob, Goyf, kiki-jiki? swords maybe? I'm sure there are a few others but I can't think of any.   There are plenty of cards they can print that are worth money. They don't need goyf when the money can be split into 8 money cards instead of just 1."

But on the other hand it was the headliner for MMA, they might not want to reprint it again when it would almost certainly overshadow Emrakul and Etched Champion, which seem to be the face of MM2015. Either way, it seems like an open question whether another limited reprint will bring the price down."
mtgmarketwatch,2tdz2i,blindfremen,2,Fri Jan 23 09:43:37 2015 UTC,"I'm right there with you. You can't just ASSUME that Goyf will be reprinted because of the price tag. The chances are high,  but by no means a guarantee.  I do think that if the reprint is real, then the prices will drop a ton. The supply of MM2015 is said to be higher than MMA, so that means more Goyf all around. I think if you're going to play with the card, then it doesn't hurt too much to get in now, but it's not a card I would speculate on."

As a 3 drop, the Sword cycle seems more efficient.   I have played against Sunforger in EDH and it was bonkers there just because of how much mana players have access to in EDH, but yeah in a format that is much more lithe than EDH, Sunforger is too cute."

mtgmarketwatch,2t9ebq,Zebo91,3,Thu Jan 22 05:34:31 2015 UTC,"This card is definitely a bomb, and while the ""Manifest/Morph deck"" may be unlikely, this guy offers strong protection against board wipes while generating card advantage/board presence. He'll need a home in current Standard, but I think there's certainly enough intrigue to make him shine.  That said, I think he is lightyears away from being the set's breakout Mythic. If Pro Tour Fate Reforged hype leads to a massive buyout of Monastery Mentors/Soulfire Grand Masters, then most other Mythics will drop as supply meets demand. For instance if Mentor becomes a staple in the ""new"" Modern, he could easily hit $40-50 in the weeks to come. For this reason I don't consider the potential payoff of another $5-10 if the hype for this card continues to grow to be worthwhile at the much morel likely chance that every mythic aside for the Big Three probably won't be worth much in a few weeks."

I would suggest that you playtest a bunch before buying into it.  If you know you're going to play with it, then I would definitely buy it, whether via pre-order or at your LGS. A $5 card can go down to $3, and you lose what, $8 on a playset? I would think being able to play it in a few extra tournaments is worth the $8, and that's the worst case scenario.  I also think this card is Modern playable, it might just be the best Delve card available right now, and a pretty amazing top deck at that. His ability is super synergestic with Delve."
mtgmarketwatch,2t81ok,fyawm,4,Thu Jan 22 00:00:35 2015 UTC,"I think he is not great to buy now. As a khan he is pretty decent, probably my second favorite from frf, and he will see fringe std play. The most probable outcome is he stays about $5 or drops back down to around $3.50, but I can't see him drop to bulk rare status, so regardless you won't lose much money.

There are so many other extremely spicy cards available to Junk now, that not only don't play well with Bob, but actually shore up formerly-terrible matchups like Burn due to Bob's life loss. There was no worse feeling than having a Bob opening hand against a Burn opponent game 1. Further, with Tron and twin expected to see a bump in play, Bob just ends up turning on their pyroclasm/bolt removal, when you could simply be jamming more discard/coursers/anafenza/tasigur."

mtgmarketwatch,2t5p6b,Gordonuts,1 point,Wed Jan 21 15:08:12 2015 UTC,I agree! I do not believe Wasteland to be in a supplementary product that is solely there to support a format and it does not much sense to add cards that are banned in this format?!

mtgmarketwatch,2t3v0u,KidJustice,4,Tue Jan 20 23:19:39 2015 UTC,"Nice write-up. I think this is one of the coolest cards out there, but unfortunately this card has several things going against it. 1: All of the recent judge promos that have dramatically increased in value were played in competitive decks (see: Show and Tell, Sneak Attack, Imperial Recruiter, Karakas, Noble Hierarch, etc). 2: Crucible of Worlds isn't particularly rare (see Imperial Recruiter, Flusterstorm). 3: It is most often played in a singleton format, EDH, so players just need one - demand is cut by 3/4 right there. 4: While cool, this card has much less general applicability than do cards like the Judge Swords (which recently increased in price dramatically). Not every cube runs Crucible, for example. 5: Three foil printings.  Overall, I don't see a lot of upside in this card long-term. There are better places to put your money. That being said, definitely get one if you need one for your deck."
mtgmarketwatch,2t3v0u,GrossoGGO,1 point,Wed Jan 21 01:33:44 2015 UTC,Both mine are in my commander decks. I picked them up during that SCG sale on Dec 31st. Since I didn't think I'd get them any cheaper than $30 anytime soon.
mtgmarketwatch,2t3v0u,GrossoGGO,2,Wed Jan 21 01:44:31 2015 UTC,"I don't think they'll get cheaper than that either, but I don't think they are going to get valuable anytime soon. That will take either: 1: a long time, or 2: a competitive deck that plays 4x Crucibles that doesn't also require a Tabernacle"
mtgmarketwatch,2t3v0u,BelcherSucks,2,Wed Jan 21 02:09:44 2015 UTC,"The issue from an investment is that the foil market is relatively flooded for the formats that want Crucible. A lot of players prefer pack foils from the original set to promos. While the old school frame does help, this means that it will probably lag behind the others. There aren't many decks in Legacy and Vintage that use Crucible so it's doubtful going to get a bump from them. The biggest use is Commander but it isn't likely to reach full saturation because the cards it enables are expensive. Fetches, Wasteland, Strip Mine and the like are all much more expensive than casuals like.  So while I'm all for owning and using, I wouldn't advocate climbing aboard the Crucible bandwagon and hoping for a spike."
mtgmarketwatch,2t3v0u,rp_1,1 point,Thu Jan 22 04:08:36 2015 UTC,I'm with you and I some as well. This is a great edh card and occasionally used to surface in lands decks. It wouldn't be hard to build a legacy deck with mana denial with out and it only gets better as more lands and land enabling creatures are printed.  Another block with landfall or another playable wasteland could easy bump this up. Its also great in edh and is one of those cards that may rise faster once it passes the regular foil since it could be considered more pimp). It was fairly recently in packets so there are a fair many out there but once it disappears expect a quick double up at a minimum.  I picked mine up at 30 when the regular was at 20 so it seemed like a pretty solid bet then and still is a pretty decent one now whenever you can find it at 35 or less.
mtgmarketwatch,2t3v0u,stitches_extra,1 point,Wed Jan 21 02:22:25 2015 UTC,"Reprint risk is super high: could also be in the last core set. Would share Standard with fetches for only a short while (KTK and FRF cycle out, leaving DTK and core set behind)."

The best comparison I can find is Skullclamp, also banned in all formats except vintage, and foil Skullclamps still going at about $15 despite being reprinted in FTV.

mtgmarketwatch,2t337x,opalgames,1 point,Wed Jan 21 20:45:55 2015 UTC,vintage does silly things to card prices. When your deck is in the five figure range a $20 foil common seems cheap. Plus it would look so bad to have normal ones next to your black bordered power.

I'm keeping an eye on these legacy lists: http://www.mtggoldfish.com/archetype/legacy-ur-delver-13222#paper Running 4x treasure cruise and 1x dig. I'm curious to see if dig will become a 3 or 4x with cruise gone. Also dig is already running in sneak and show & OmniTell as a 1x.

mtgmarketwatch,2t1fq5,GHChinMTG,3,Tue Jan 20 10:43:42 2015 UTC,"I don't agree with the reasoning that the possibility of a M16 reprint makes Thundermaw Hellkite a risky buy.  If anything, I would expect the opposite.  If it gets reprinted, then sure, the long-term value goes down due to increased supply.  But in the short term?  If Thundermaw Hellkite becomes a standard legal card in a format with Hornet Queen, I can easily see it jumping to $15 and beyond.  Compare to Stormbreath Dragon, which hit heights of $20 and has never gone below $12.  Then consider that Stormbreath Dragon was printed in a large fall set that was drafted a ton due to the structure of Theros block draft, while M16 is a core set (which are notoriously for being among the least-cracked sets).  If I had insider knowledge that Thundermaw Hellkite to see a M16 reprint, I would be buying every copy I could get my hands on for under $10.  This thing would tear standard up, as it just looks better than Stormbreath Dragon.  Losing ""protection from white"" matters a lot less in a format without Path to Exile (killing Hornet Queen tokens seems much better), and don't forget that the Hellkite is a 5/5 body while Stormbreath is a 4/4.  As it is, I'm not buying, because I expect the reality to be much more boring: there's a very real possibility that Thundermaw Hellkite sees no reprint and continues its steady decline, and the copies that you bought for $9 are worth $7-8 a year from now.  I honestly wouldn't consider Thundermaw Hellkite a ""risky"" by; if anything, I'd say it's the opposite: as a mythic dragon from a core set with modern implications, it's probably already pretty close to its price floor.  The only really terrible scenario for Thundermaw Hellkite is if it gets reprinted in something like a Commander set, which doesn't seem like a very likely possibility when there are so many other mythic dragons with greater casual appeal.  There is room for upward growth on this things if it sprouts new wings in modern, but I think there are much better things to do with your money.  It's certainly not a ""bad"" bet, but I'd much rather have my money in cards like Restoration Angel and Abrupt Decay."

mtgmarketwatch,2szrnp,Theangryhermit,2,Tue Jan 20 01:00:33 2015 UTC,"Good analysis. The thing I wonder (and which I thought you might be getting at in the title) is whether general interest in Modern is going to suffer. After all, a large portion of the player base had their decks (costing several hundred to over a thousand dollars) either banned or neutered. There are a lot of angry people, and a lot of people who do not trust Modern as something to buy into. Its reasonable to suspect that there are many people who (even if they can afford it) will NOT say ""Oh, that's probably good for the meta! I will just go out and spend $1000+ on some Goyfs...and Bobs...and Lilianas...""  Point being: A significant percentage of the Modern player base really IS going to either say ""Screw it"" or ""I can't afford a new deck"". Its a real possibility that the overall Modern market will fall, because a significant portion of the customer/player base has been genuinely alienated. This may not occur, but it certainly increases the risk from an investing standpoint for anyone holding Modern staples."
mtgmarketwatch,2szrnp,completefarside,2,Tue Jan 20 04:24:55 2015 UTC,"Maybe. The title was more in reference to the meta with so many of the most played decks being shaken up or completely destroyed, but I do agree with your point. I mean, everyone just saw the two most played decks in the room get crushed by bannings, so it makes sense that people would be worried about sinking money in the format.   Personally, I'm worried about parking money in the format, between constant reprints and top-deck bannings, it just doesn't feel safe to me."

I've spoken in other posts about how most of the cards in those decks have homes in other archetypes, but I have to imagine there are a significant number of angry nerds with pitchforks wanting to give the B&R committee a piece of their mind.

I think a large population of pod players will switch to the almost exactly the same - junk deck. If not they'll find something else.  Can't say the same for delver, but let's be honest, most people player delver were spikes, and not playing it because it's so much fun. Many of these people just wanted to play the winningist deck and there will be a winningist deck in a couple weeks, so they have options."

Many people don't pay enough attention to ban rumors to have this on their radar (they just play(ed) Modern). I think their were others who believed that Wizards was a smarter company than one that would alienate a large portion of their most loyal base for very questionable reasons.  I don't think it is true that Pod invalidates other creature decks. Jund was (is) a creature deck, and it was nerfed for being too strong. Merfolk, while not quite a top deck, is a creature deck that could give Pod a lot of problems. Maybe Pod made things rough for Zoo...but then again Wizards made things rough for Zoo when they banned Wild Nacatl.   They are not fostering confidence in their product."

If everyone is calling it correctly and Jund/Junk/UWR are all coming back, Blood Moon was one of the best ways to combat them.  That being said, Blood Moon is already high from its last spike, but I can see it hitting $20 for the black-bordered editions without a reprint and a few dollars to be made on the white-bordered editions.  edit: heck, there was even a 'white moon' deck floating around online, and Skred Red also runs it.  edit2: I also hear Blood Moon is pretty good against Tron."

In a similar vein, Bloodghast could see a bump as well.  Another one is Dark Confidant is probably going to be making a big comeback as BGx decks go back to him for card advantage.

Most people are aware I was firmly in the ""TC is fine, pod is more oppressive"" camp, but by banning all 3 they eliminate the argument that delver fills the void presented by a pod banning, or vice versa.  Lots and lots of price movements for the rest of the modern staple list as a result. Zoo, tron, burn, and affinity are the big financial winners.

Then they see the foil mythics/rares and think its feasible, but in reality it's pulling info from mtgotraders and cardhoarder for the lows where foils commons & uncommons that aren't possible to find are listed at <.10 tickets with 0 stock. So in reality I expect the spread is closer to $450 vs $800, but the $800 is using TCG Median so what you'll really get is closer to $650. Then considering shipping/trade in fees ($30) and selling fees (~15%) you're actually seeing $480 vs $550. Unless you have a bot system you're buying with, you're likely spending a lot of time on this between buying and selling so seems not worth it.  I'd guess that you're better off investing the $500 in getting 4x sets of the non foils then outing the paper playsets than going for the single foil set. At least based on my experience getting together a standard 1x all for redemption compared to how long it's taking me to put together a foil set.  Update: Took all the DojoTrade buy prices, summed, and multiplied by 1.15x for an estimated of what they'd sell for and came up with about $430 to buy 1x all foils from KTK."
mtgmarketwatch,2svuvj,mtd14,2,Mon Jan 19 01:20:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah people are definitely underestimating the money it takes to get this done. If it was just hundreds of dollars in free money, I'm sure the bot owners wouldn't just be leaving it on the table for someone else to pick up."
mtgmarketwatch,2svuvj,GHChinMTG,2,Mon Jan 19 01:38:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's why I pointed out in my article to allocate at least an extra $90 to assemble the foil commons and uncommons. My last foil KTK redemption costed me around $485 and that was inclusive of the extra $27 for international delivery.   I agree there is not a large margin of a few hundred dollars from flipping redeemed foil sets. But it's a great way to get your hands on foil fetchlands below market price. From my experience, the other high value foils were easier to move than I thought, and people were willing to pay close to retail for them due to their scarcity. It's not everyday that you see someone walk into an LGS with all the foil KTK mythics and chase foils. At least for the ones I frequent."
mtgmarketwatch,2svuvj,GHChinMTG,1 point,Mon Jan 19 04:13:09 2015 UTC,"So when you've moved complete sets, how did you go about it? I was planning on listing all of the more expensive stuff on craigslist and a local facebook group, then ship the rest to a buylist if it's mostly bulk foils. Did you just trade most of them off for value at your LGS?"
mtgmarketwatch,2svuvj,GHChinMTG,2,Mon Jan 19 04:29:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the foil singles I've moved were all sold to other players at my LGS or friends. Craigslist and local Facebook groups sounds good, and is certainly better than outing them via eBay. I haven't tried those avenues myself as I drop by my LGSes twice a week and every time I open my trade binder, there is a good probability that someone would be interested in one of the redeemed foils.   Sometimes you might even find buyers for seemingly bulk foils. The clan-lands are played in EDH and there are players looking for the odd uncommon foil like Seeker of the Way."
mtgmarketwatch,2svuvj,CigarPete,1 point,Mon Jan 19 04:50:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that definitely seems like a good way to go. I was a bit confused about whether you were selling the cards to other players at your LGS. The ones in my area are pretty strict about not allowing sales from player to player inside the store, so I wasn't sure if you were doing cash or just value trading them or something like that."
mtgmarketwatch,2svuvj,GHChinMTG,1 point,Tue Jan 20 23:24:05 2015 UTC,"Selling. Yeah, there are some LGSes in my place have a strict no player-to-player selling rule too. I only sell at the LGSes that are okay with player-to-player selling.   I guess value trading them works too, but as at the moment there are not many things I am looking for. But with Fate Reforged coming out next week, that will most certainly change."
mtgmarketwatch,2svuvj,mtd14,1 point,Wed Jan 21 04:32:18 2015 UTC,"If you are looking to out them for value trading, I would suggest Pucatrade. Even if there is nothing you want now, you can out the cards and hold the points until there is something you want."
mtgmarketwatch,2svuvj,joedud1,1 point,Fri Jan 23 15:08:47 2015 UTC,That's a good point. I've started a PucaTrade account after reading Travis Allen's article on it a short while back but I've since forgotten about it! Life's been a little busier than usual lately.

mtgmarketwatch,2srx4w,jimini-christmas,3,Sat Jan 17 23:34:51 2015 UTC,"But Wizards responded to the criticism regarding True-Name Nemesis and shipped more Mind Seize-packs to stores. I'm not sure the same is the case here. Then again, Containment Priest is (currently) just a sideboard card."
mtgmarketwatch,2srx4w,jimini-christmas,3,Sat Jan 17 23:39:13 2015 UTC,"sure, that's the big drop on the graph. Ignore that part and look at the rest of it. Always down.   Priest is going to be opened in similar quantities.   Tnn is proactive and is strong in most board states, priest is reactive and situational, and is no better than A bear in a lot of match ups.   I could be wrong, but I can't see this card being worth its current price point.   Anecdotally I have seen about two times more priest in trade binders than I saw of tnn this time last year."
mtgmarketwatch,2srx4w,Rock-swarm,1 point,Sun Jan 18 00:40:27 2015 UTC,"All valid points, however keep in mind the fact that the Mind Seize deck had more going for it than just TNN. Meanwhile, the white commander pre-con is essentially containment priest, skullclamp, and Nahiri, with 90% of the value being locked up with containment priest. All this really means is that the priest's price decline will happen more gradually."
mtgmarketwatch,2srx4w,jassi007,1 point,Sun Jan 18 02:40:57 2015 UTC,"Wizards is committed to meeting demand for commander products. They aren't limited releases, they are yearly releases. Think duel deck singles vs. FTV. Long term, TNN and Containment priest, baring reprints, may go up. Supply in the near future, 12-18 months after the product goes out of print, is meeting demand."
mtgmarketwatch,2srx4w,davekayaus,1 point,Sun Jan 18 13:09:51 2015 UTC,"I think you need to decide whether the risk of paying three dollar or so more per card is worth the risk of waiting. Right now it looks like Containment Priest is slipping gradually down. It sees some play, but not nearly as much as Flusterstorm. Crucially, Flusterstorm sees significantly more Vintage play.  IMO, the price floor for Containment Priest is $15. So you can wait, but if something were to drive up its Vintage and Legacy appeal, then it will rise, and steeply."
mtgmarketwatch,2ss3uc,TheCello,3,Sat Jan 17 23:38:51 2015 UTC,I didn't see or hear of a single alt Ugin at my prerelease. It seems pretty damn rare to me.
mtgmarketwatch,2ss3uc,blindfremen,2,Sun Jan 18 05:34:08 2015 UTC,"On what basis are you saying they aren't that rare? Lets say there are 10k-20k magic hobby stores in the U.S. Each box has 2 Ugin's. So thats a total of 20-40k of the alt arts. I'm pretty sure this is lower than the number of any given revised dual land, for comparison. These are going to be quite rare. From a collectors standpoint, unless you want to foil out everything, this will be the most in demand version."
mtgmarketwatch,2ss3uc,jassi007,1 point,Sun Jan 18 13:22:32 2015 UTC,"Well, those numbers aren't that far off from what people on ebay are selling and/or bidding at.  http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2055119.m570.l1313.TR4.TRC1.A0.H0.Xalternate+art+ugin&_nkw=alternate+art+ugin&_sacat=0  There are multiple bids of over $80."

So, as a caution, if you plan to buy at local shops at $3 you need to sell immediately at $5-$6 and hope people are willing to pay extra to have them for release weekend."
mtgmarketwatch,2sqdcl,mtd14,1 point,Sat Jan 17 15:33:40 2015 UTC,"The only thing is that they were off a little bit.   Supreme verdict dipped below $4 for only a very short time while it was standard. It spent most of its time above 5: http://www.mtggoldfish.com/price/Return+to+Ravnica/Supreme+Verdict#paper  That being said, I'm surprised about the spike of crux of fate. I haven't seen the new control build it is being used in. Many pros said they preferred UB control with vaults, radiant fountains, and PLA. Crux of fate doesn't synergize with that strategy as well."

A metric ton of cards are going to be opened this thursday when people's pre-orders are collected, which makes this temporary price spike very much a moot point in less than a week. As other people have pointed out, despite Supreme Verdict's success in standard (as well as it's playability in modern and legacy), it never broke $5.

mtgmarketwatch,2sp5t7,kefkacakes,4,Sat Jan 17 03:59:10 2015 UTC,"It depends on what is banned/unbanned.  Survival seems a longshot to get unbanned.  Just because WotC doesn't really care about Legacy.  I wouldn't really expect GGT unbanning either.  I'm not sure how much Vengevine would go up on a GGT unbanning.  The problem is that Vengevine is still fairly expensive, so you're talking about a pretty sizeable investment on something that is pretty speculative.  It would obviously go up on some of these changes, but are you willing to bet $10/Vengevine that something is going to get unbanned?  High risk, high reward scenario."
mtgmarketwatch,2sp5t7,CorpT,1 point,Sat Jan 17 04:04:58 2015 UTC,Anyone who thinks SotF has a ghost of a chance of coming off the Legacy banlist was not playing Legacy when that card was legal. No way no how.
mtgmarketwatch,2sp5t7,candres,2,Sat Jan 17 05:03:07 2015 UTC,"Not disagreeing with you, just pointing out that the card was bought the fuck out on TCG recently, which probably means nothing but might mean something.    The problem with this speculation is it assumes Wizards gives any modicum of shits about Legacy."
mtgmarketwatch,2sp5t7,yavimaya_eldred,1 point,Sun Jan 18 00:13:10 2015 UTC,"I agree with corpT that its a long shot because wizards doesn't care about legacy much, hasn't removed safe cards from the banned list and its a tutor card.   As for it being too good, times have changed.  Wizards has printed more playable maindeck and sideboard hate cards since survival was banned.  Dedicated combo decks can go off faster (sneak attack, omnitell, storm) and play disruption (counters, discard). Blue tempo decks play disruption (counters, discard). The few successful non blue decks have a combo finish (elves, lands) or pack hate bears (death and taxes).  I hope it would be good enough to bring g/w back and give non blue players another option. But even if the best version of survival were blue, it would just be another good blue deck."
mtgmarketwatch,2sp5t7,sega4ever,1 point,Sat Jan 17 22:10:24 2015 UTC,"Agreed. If shardless agent and DRS weren't legal, and scav ooze was a colorless artifact creature with colorless activation, SotF might have been safe to unban. Unfortunately that particular deck engine is Birthing Pod on steroids."
mtgmarketwatch,2sp5t7,Rock-swarm,1 point,Sat Jan 17 05:22:30 2015 UTC,"I would think so. Vengevine was a house with SotF. Naturally, I think people would gravitate to that and raise its price."

mtgmarketwatch,2smcst,thegrease,2,Fri Jan 16 17:03:40 2015 UTC,Just bought a bunch of Humble Defectors since it likes Jeskai Ascendancy a lot.  Probably would be worth getting foils for Modern/Legacy but the issue there is the only copies I can find are $12 and you can get non-foils for $0.30 a piece so that's a tad bit high if I do say so myself.

mtgmarketwatch,2skcff,rp_1,4,Thu Jan 15 22:36:33 2015 UTC,"I think you'll be holding these for a good while before you can make a profit on then. You bought them at retail value and there are 10+ vendors who are selling them for $25 - supply is no issue. Another factor with this card is that players will likely only want a single copy, as EDH and cube players will be the ones you're going to sell to."
mtgmarketwatch,2skcff,GrossoGGO,6,Fri Jan 16 02:29:21 2015 UTC,"Some points against the judge promo:  The judge promo also reuses the second art for the card.  Foils exist of the card already, outside of Judge foils.  Card has zero constructed playability, price is driven solely by EDH/casual demand.    That said, this is basically the King of Casual and it interacts with Planeswalkers, so there is light demand.  I would predict slow and steady gains until an eventual reprint, but I highly doubt it's going to spike up overnight."
mtgmarketwatch,2skcff,Manadyne,1 point,Fri Jan 16 07:07:06 2015 UTC,"Another point against the Judge promo: it isn't old border (ala Judge Bob, Hierarch, Crucible, etc.), which essentially makes it the same as the MMA foil."

mtgmarketwatch,2skcff,Rockenos,1 point,Fri Jan 16 11:22:30 2015 UTC,"Not a bad idea, relatively low risk. The main problem is if this card goes in a commander supplement it will lose it's value overnight. The judge foil has the best chance of maintaining its value though, and if it avoids reprint for long enough it will inevitably grow in value"
mtgmarketwatch,2skcff,davekayaus,1 point,Fri Jan 16 22:34:02 2015 UTC,"But will it? Doubling Season stayed solidly between $20 and $25, rising above this and briefly spiking to $30 before Modern Masters.   When set set was released it went back to $15 and has been climbing steadily since then, rising over $20 once more.  If it were printed in a Commander product, IMO that would barely move the price, and would not affect the Judge Foil price at all.  This card's demand base is basically 'every casual player of Magic' and supplemental set printing is not enough to blunt the price for that level of demand."
mtgmarketwatch,2skcff,yavimaya_eldred,1 point,Sat Jan 17 04:49:20 2015 UTC,"Commander printings don't effect foils all that much, unless they start squeezing foils into the product at some point."

mtgmarketwatch,2skptz,bcopes,4,Fri Jan 16 00:24:29 2015 UTC,"not a bad profit. If you wait to long and it finds its way into a supplemental product the value may drop a fair amount though,  I'd flip them an not look back."
mtgmarketwatch,2skptz,rp_1,3,Fri Jan 16 00:27:35 2015 UTC,This is a silly question.   If you use them then keep your toy and continue valuing them at $0.   If your intention was profit you try to liquidate. 2.5x is a stupid margin.
mtgmarketwatch,2skptz,jimini-christmas,2,Fri Jan 16 06:09:01 2015 UTC,The price spiked but the buylist prices haven't gone up the same amount. That being said ABU is buying them at 13 each.

mtgmarketwatch,2skptz,nylarotep,1 point,Fri Jan 16 15:08:48 2015 UTC,"Dump them all, the price is already coming back down. It's also not on the reserved list, so technically WotC could reprint it at some point and it only sees fringe play in Legacy and probably casual (my guess for the spike was the reveal of Soulfire Grand Master or someone attempting a buyout on an older card)."

mtgmarketwatch,2shktc,JasonEAltMTG,3,Thu Jan 15 05:29:42 2015 UTC,I think it's funny that regular copies of BBE have already spiked two different times before set releases. People really want that card unbanned.
mtgmarketwatch,2shktc,yavimaya_eldred,0,Thu Jan 15 07:27:20 2015 UTC,"People in hell want ice water. That said, I wish a BBE unbanning would lead to more decks. I want to play Boom//Bust Naya, but everyone would just play Jund"
mtgmarketwatch,2shktc,Rock-swarm,1 point,Thu Jan 15 07:44:29 2015 UTC,"Maybe, maybe not. There's a decent tier 2 mono green aggro list that is meant to beat up on delver and pod, and it's entirely possible that BBE allows the deck to run boom/bust as a sideboard option against the decks that give it the most trouble, i.e. tron, twin, storm, and scapeshift. Paired with blood moon, you have an aggro deck that can shit out its hand by turn 4 while also attacking the mana base as hard as blue moon."
mtgmarketwatch,2shktc,yavimaya_eldred,1 point,Thu Jan 15 12:58:37 2015 UTC,"It is a little disheartening that the only consistent aggro deck is robots, I'm not really sure what the fix is. Maybe print better aggro two and three drops?"
mtgmarketwatch,2shktc,Rock-swarm,2,Thu Jan 15 16:14:54 2015 UTC,"Zoo and merfolk are perfectly viable aggro decks in modern. They just don't see as much play as robots due to the difference in deck prices, especially in regards to the mana base. Players capable of playing with goyfs are more likely to use them in a Rock, Twin, or Delver list than a zoo list, depending on the meta."
mtgmarketwatch,2shktc,yavimaya_eldred,1 point,Fri Jan 16 00:50:44 2015 UTC,"Zoo is okay, I don't think Merfolk is that good, certainly not tier one. Merfolk isn't even that expensive of a deck."
mtgmarketwatch,2shktc,Rock-swarm,1 point,Fri Jan 16 01:51:47 2015 UTC,"Tier refers to presence in the meta, not effectiveness, though the term has recently become synonymous with how good a deck is perceived to be. See this for the aggregate modern metagame. Only 4 decks currently qualify for the traditional ""tier 1"" status as comprising 10% or more of the meta. Granted, MTGTop8 tracks top 8 lists for reported events, so it's likely affinity and burn have potential tier 1 status for any given field due to the cheapness and popularity of the archetypes.  What's not debatable, is the fact that Zoo and Merfolk are actually well-positioned in the current meta. Merfolk has a weak matchup to Pod and affinity, but does quite well against delver, Junk, burn, scapeshift, and tron. Zoo has good matchups against almost every archetype other than Pod, titanbloom/breachscape, UWR midrange, and Scapeshift."

mtgmarketwatch,2sf3mx,ahriik,8,Wed Jan 14 17:29:42 2015 UTC,"This almost 100% because of speculation regarding its possible unbanning in modern. People love their foils in non-rotating formats.  It is also notable that Alara Reborn pack foils of the card are next to sold-out on TCG. If they begin to be restocked, I'd imagine they would be at a similar price range to the promos. That is, if it is in fact unbanned. If it remains banned, expect all the foils to drop."

mtgmarketwatch,2sg2ql,Lollipopsaurus,2,Thu Jan 15 01:06:40 2015 UTC,"To add to this, and make it more meaningful, Chord was only ever played because Green Sun's Zenith was banned, and extra tutor redundancy can be helpful.  So right away, you're looking at a second string card(which isn't necessarily a bad thing) serving as a redundant tutor for Birthing Pod.  Pod decks are running fewer and fewer Chords so they can run more value creatures(Rhino) or Wall of Roots.  The net effect of this is that pod decks can more reliably pump out value creatures or pod on turn 3 because they likely have at least 4 mana to use.  The issue is about early game vs mid game where Chord really shines.  I think Chord is a good card, but it's being pushed out of the meta right now by faster and faster decks.  I think the best case scenario for this card is that either Pod gets banned(probably won't happen any time soon), a card is printed that warps the meta to become slightly slower(unlikely), or some other crazy archetype emerges."

There just isn't a ton of upside. There is no way they double in the next year, or probably even 5.   While dig and ascendency are also extremely risky, they have the potential to increase substantially. If they get banned in modern, they still have standard, legacy, vintage, edh and cube.

My advice would be to invest in Hallowed Fountains.  My reasoning is three fold. Worst case scenario you have Blue shock land which will always have some sort of a value and is probably at its lowest right now at ~$7. This makes the spec relatively low risk.  My second reason is Modern Masters 2015. Though I don't expect the same influx of people that the first Modern Masters brought, I do expect at least a short term increase in the number of players getting in.   My third reasoning (and the one that is perhaps off base) is Monastery Mentor. Though I personally am not buying as crazily into the hype as some are I do think people will want to try to make it work. If it finds a home in a modern deck it would be UW or Jeskai making the potential for a quick bump possible very soon.  TLDR: Hallowed Fountains because low risk and potential for a couple bumps with Monastery Mentor and MM2015."
mtgmarketwatch,2seuwl,C_Terror,3,Wed Jan 14 19:16:50 2015 UTC,"Hallowed fountain is one of the most available shock lands since it was printed in an event deck as well.   If you're going to look for value shock lands, Steam Vents and Overgrown Tomb are the two best bets, and not just because of the current meta, but because these two combinations will always be relevant and popular in Modern.   I think there are much better shocklands to spec on than Hallowed Fountain."
mtgmarketwatch,2seuwl,jimini-christmas,1 point,Wed Jan 14 19:52:17 2015 UTC,always is a pretty dangerous thought. There was a time when tundra was the best land in vintage. And legacy. It's arguably the worst blue dual today.
mtgmarketwatch,2seuwl,C_Terror,1 point,Wed Jan 14 19:56:15 2015 UTC,"While that's true, Twin is a quintessential Modern deck that is in UR Colours. Delver will always be a deck even if TC is banned and that's in UR colours as well. While Control may eventually eschew R in favour of B or straight UW, I don't see Bolt Snap Bolt going any where anytime soon, making Steam Vents relevant.   Abrupt Decay is the best catchall in the format, and it's in BG colours which, in my opinion will make Overgrown Tomb always relevant."
mtgmarketwatch,2seuwl,jimini-christmas,1 point,Wed Jan 14 20:02:02 2015 UTC,you examples were all printed since m11.

mtgmarketwatch,2seuwl,jimini-christmas,2,Wed Jan 14 21:51:46 2015 UTC,"ill try to rephrase. When you use absolutes like always you are saying there is no possible scenario where some other lands become dominant in modern. Magic is not static. 8th edition (the start of modern) was printed in 2007. That's 8 years of card pool. In 8 more years the card pool will be close to twice that size. In another 8 the current card pool will only represent ~1/3 of the modern card pool.   Modern as a format has yet to prove it has staying power. It's popular, and wizards is supporting it, but it's still new. Who is to say the format will even exist in 2020 or 2030.   I'm not saying those lands are bad. They are the best shock lands in modern today. I'm simply pointing out that you are assuming that what is true today will also be true tomorrow. Historically that hasn't been the case."

mtgmarketwatch,2sgsj2,quick_q_throwaway,7,Thu Jan 15 01:13:32 2015 UTC,"Even if TC ends up being like forked bolt, there's a few significant problems in your gameplan.   Moving 1,000 copies is a logistical nightmare. Very large amounts of time and initial shipping costs will be incurred, not to mention the hassle of keeping track of literally hundreds of orders. No single buyer is going to want more than 50 at a time, and those are few and far between (and often not at the highest margin of gain). For equivalent cost, it's easier to go ""deep"" on safer specs like seige rhino, DTT, or as another poster said, foil TCs. Smaller portfolio, less upkeep, more opportunities to cash out for a profit based on meta shifts. Speaking of cashing out, non-foil TC is being opened at the rate of literally hundreds per week. This will continue for another 3 months based on drafting and set redemptions. That means not only does TC need to survive banning, it needs to see MORE play over the course of the next year and a half in order to gain during it's time in standard. If you want to sit on it for modern/legacy value, have fun storing 1,000 copies for likely 5 years before you see actionable returns. You would honestly be better off not even buying them until they rotate out of standard.   TL;DR - No, it's a stupid idea. There's better specs that are more diversified and easier to liquidate than non-foil TC."

mtgmarketwatch,2sgsj2,roseffin,1 point,Thu Jan 15 01:50:51 2015 UTC,"Right.  But a $200 investment in foil Cruises is unlikely to go up by 10 or 20 times.  The 1000 Cruises might.  It's a riskier bet and a lot more work, but with a chance of a higher payoff."
mtgmarketwatch,2sgsj2,akaWhitey,1 point,Thu Jan 15 02:02:32 2015 UTC,"But that higher payoff does not included shipping and effort for a couple hundred separate orders.  Example: you might buy 10 x $20 foils. In 2-3 years, these foils will be $35, buylisted for $25 or so. So $50 profit.  If you buy the same value of normal cruises ($200 would probably get you 1000 copies or so), and they go from $.20 ea to $.50 ea (buylisted for $.30) , that seems like you made a lot more, $100. But then you still need to sell 1000 copies of treasure cruise, which is a pain in the ass. Is finding different store that are each willing to take 20 copies of treasure cruise worth that extra $50? Is it even going to up by that much? Would someone else buy it in bulk on ebay?  Most speculators want to avoid those later questions, sticking to sure bets."
mtgmarketwatch,2sgsj2,jimini-christmas,1 point,Thu Jan 15 02:17:46 2015 UTC,"I don't like the idea of investing in Treasure Cruises (although if you did, foil is the way to go) right now because there is about an 85% chance of a ban in Modern, and about a 10% chance of ban in Legacy. Even if it didn't put 8 copies of Delver into the GP Omaha Top 8, it is still quite heavily warping the meta around it, and it doesn't help that many pros are writing articles calling it the second coming of Christ. At least wait until Monday."

In addition, I think we're going to start seeing people foil out Modern decks as it becomes a more robust format."
mtgmarketwatch,2s9721,GHChinMTG,2,Tue Jan 13 16:55:29 2015 UTC,Foil Delver of Secrets is definitely too cheap at $15 if Treasure Cruise is not banned on the 19th (I think it will not be banned). Especially with Innistrad narrowly avoiding reprint in the upcoming Modern Masters 2015.
mtgmarketwatch,2s9721,sensitivePornGuy,2,Tue Jan 13 15:42:16 2015 UTC,Glad to find somebody else who thinks the Cruise won't be banned. We seem to be thin on the ground.
mtgmarketwatch,2s9721,GHChinMTG,2,Wed Jan 14 10:19:08 2015 UTC,Together we stand on the no-ban Cruise! Or sink if Wizards icebergs it next Monday.
mtgmarketwatch,2s9721,runhome,-1,Thu Jan 15 03:44:57 2015 UTC,"Well when you think about it you have an equal chance of getting any card in a set as a foil, so siege rhino and tc have the same number of regular foils on the market, but then SR had those pesky foil promos bring down their price"
mtgmarketwatch,2s9721,Rock-swarm,3,Tue Jan 13 07:40:22 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure foil distributions follow similarly to regular rarities. I know that you get 1 foil rare/mythic in a box on average while you get a number of commons and uncommons.
mtgmarketwatch,2s7v0m,Sav10r,10,Mon Jan 12 23:07:55 2015 UTC,"In a word, No.  In a few more words, no they have not because we have three months of drafting with Fate Reforged where you can still get a fetch in all three packs. In terms of strict supply, we're nowhere near that point. Prices may not fall exactly in line with supply when it comes to something like fetchlands that people simply won't part with below a certain price due to price memory, but they should still have some room to fall."
mtgmarketwatch,2s7v0m,Chosler88,5,Tue Jan 13 05:28:26 2015 UTC,"I like this explanation, simple but covers the important basics."
mtgmarketwatch,2s7v0m,mtd14,1 point,Tue Jan 13 06:42:56 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how much of an effect it would have, but it's possible that demand will go up in the coming few months, if two colour decks become more prevalent in Standard, or something else happens that makes people want to play fetches as 4-ofs, which they mostly are not currently."
mtgmarketwatch,2s7v0m,sensitivePornGuy,5,Wed Jan 14 10:24:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, no, maybe. We can look at each in turn.   First though - it is best not to treat the 'Khans fetches' as a single group that may all go up or down together. Their price behaviour is already diverging and there are good reasons for this.  The stars: aka 'the ones with blue in them'. Polluted Delta and Flooded Strand have outperformed the others and will continue to do so, buoyed by eternal format demand.  The orphans: Wooded Foothills and Bloodstained Mire are the cheapest and will continue to lose value. Demand simply isn't there.  If you believe the likes of Bloodbraid Elf and Deathrite Shaman will be unbanned, then these cards can be bought now as their price won't rise without the return of Jund to its former glory.  Middle of the Road: Windswept Heath. It has less demand than the stars and more than the orphans. It may also benefit from standard demand.   With this in mind, you can see the answers. In all probability, the stars have hit their floor and we won't see them below $15 for long, if at all.  The orphans will continue to slip and their floor could be below $10.  The price risks that apply to all the above cards is either: 1. the Zendikar fetches are reprinted in Dragons of Tarkir. More fetches means demand is spread across more cards. This will affect the orphans more than the stars. 2. These fetches are reprinted again in Dragons of Tarkir. Still a possibility, since their art and flavour texts is about the dead brood leader dragons of Fate Reforged, and perhaps those long-lived dragons will be alive and well in Dragons of Tarkir with changes lands to show for it.  With the reprint probability so high (IMO) wait and see is probably the best approach. I would not hesitate to pick up Polluted Delta or Flooded Strand below $15, but I like to work to a 4-6 year hold time on utility cards with solid demand.   So to return to your question of 'have the fetches hit their floor?'  Yes - Polluted Delta and Flooded Strand are not going to dip without further reprints.  No - Wooded Foothills and Bloodstained Mire will slip further  Maybe - Windswept Heath could go either way"
mtgmarketwatch,2s7v0m,davekayaus,2,Wed Jan 14 00:00:37 2015 UTC,"Very well thought out post, +1.  With pod being such a strong contender in modern, and Siege Rhino pushing non-pod based junk builds as well, Windswept Heath is looking pretty solid. Wooded Foothills may pick up some value by being the fetch for people who don't want to spring for Verdant Catacombs."
mtgmarketwatch,2s7v0m,Notalec,0,Wed Jan 14 11:13:34 2015 UTC,"The real difference here between Shocklands and KTK fetchlands is the fetchlands are legal in modern for the first time.  Outside of that, I'd expect similar behavior to Shocklands.  Wait until what lands (if any) are in DTK before you buy.  If KTK has insanely high sales, the fetches will drop at rotation just like shocks."
mtgmarketwatch,2s7v0m,Lollipopsaurus,5,Tue Jan 13 04:00:49 2015 UTC,"Except shocks did'nt drop or very little at rotation, so I wouldn't expect fetches to do so. They will just begin to go up at that point.  True that if ennemy fetches are in DTK, they will drop kinda hard."
mtgmarketwatch,2s7v0m,MetalFearz,3,Tue Jan 13 16:19:13 2015 UTC,"The bigger difference is that fetches are played in every format (Standard, Modern, Legacy and Vintage) while shocks see almost no Legacy or Vintage play.  I don't see them dropping much from where they are now."
mtgmarketwatch,2s7v0m,djhitman,3,Tue Jan 13 05:20:06 2015 UTC,"We still have 3 months of drafting where, as Corbin points out, you still have a chance to open a fetchland in all 3 packs. They're still going to drop."

mtgmarketwatch,2s7v0m,Carnilawl,3,Tue Jan 13 05:16:34 2015 UTC,"There is speculation that the Zendikar fetches will be reprinted in DTK. I don't think that's likely (though I think they will likely be reprinted in the next year or so, either in Modern Masters 2015 or in one of next year's new 2-set blocks)."
mtgmarketwatch,2s7v0m,djhitman,2,Tue Jan 13 05:22:26 2015 UTC,"I'm betting we'll see either filter lands, or something entirely new in DTK.  Wizards has been ramming it down our throats that post-Fate Reforged Tarkir is very different."
mtgmarketwatch,2s7v0m,Lollipopsaurus,2,Tue Jan 13 05:26:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but enemy fetches fit the theme of an altered timeline that's occurring in Fate Reforged. ""Look! All those flooded strands turned into scalding tarns and arid mesas! Cock Magic!""."
mtgmarketwatch,2s7v0m,Rock-swarm,1 point,Tue Jan 13 05:52:13 2015 UTC,"I've been on this tip, but given that Dragons is looking likely to be based on allied colour pairs I'm no longer sure."
mtgmarketwatch,2s7v0m,sensitivePornGuy,0,Wed Jan 14 10:32:43 2015 UTC,"The question was ""have Khans fetches hit their floor yet?  If the land cycle in DTK is as appealing as KTK fetches, then less KTK will eventually be opened, and the post-rotation price of KTK fetches will be higher than RTR shocklands for sure, but if the land cycle is something like fast lands, then we'll see more KTK product opened, and thus lower KTK fetch prices."

mtgmarketwatch,2s9bdm,Eros_is_god,11,Tue Jan 13 07:00:57 2015 UTC,"There is a fixed retail value of a pack at $4.    If the ev of a pack were to get above $4, people (stores/dealers) would just crack packs, thereby increasing supply and lowering value of the cards. So all cards in a set are fighting for a piece of that fixed ev.  If all rares are equally desired, each will be worth $4. But if a chase rare is worth $80, that means it is worth it to open 20 packs to find one of that rare.  Say for example the odds of getting that rare is 1:40. So after 40 packs, you have spend $160 for a $80 card. The other 39 rares will be worth a combined $80, or about $2 each. This assumes commons and uncommons are worthless for simplicity's sake."
mtgmarketwatch,2s9bdm,wakingrufus,2,Tue Jan 13 07:16:28 2015 UTC,"The EV of a pack can actually be expressed a fairly simple, if tedious set of calculations. You can determine the fair value of each card in a set, then multiply it by the likelihood of pulling each of those cards in each pack and then aggregate it. That number is the EV of opening a pack.   Unfortunately, there are some things that make that simple EV less useful. The main input (the fair value of each card) is subjective, constantly changing and easy to misinterpret. As well, EV only is really useful tool if you are opening store quantities of factory sealed product. I know a lot of guys at the local shop I go to actually watch pulls out of boxes from pedestrian traffic and keep track of it like card counting.   You can use it as a gross tool about if you are willing to buy a box at X price. You also can use it as a predictive tool. If the market suddenly changes how it's valuing sealed boxes on ebay or big sites like SCG, it can be an early sign of a shift. For example, the spot price on Gatecrash boxes listed on ebay jumped 20% in the middle of born of the gods spoilers. That was a sign that one party was buying up boxes based on speculation from the spoiler. I liquidated out the case I had stored for drafting and rebought it for a $200 gain four months down the line after the speculation spike went back down.   You also can use it to determine which draft format on MTGO is best if you don't have a preference. Supernova's list makes aggregating that stuff easy so people have websites that are ultra accurate."
mtgmarketwatch,2s6ghh,zeroz802,4,Mon Jan 12 16:49:34 2015 UTC,"They corrected the article to state that there are 6 possible promos per clan, not 8. They'll probably do the hybrid mythics, clan leaders, dragons, sieges, a cycle of instant/sorceries and a cycle of creatures."
mtgmarketwatch,2s6ghh,Maimed_Dan,3,Mon Jan 12 19:04:36 2015 UTC,"Probably exactly what it meant for Khans. The prerelease promos will fit in the ""higher than the non-foil, but slightly lower than the pack foils"" gap."

mtgmarketwatch,2s5wql,Silvermagi,4,Mon Jan 12 13:49:42 2015 UTC,I would not spec on this card for any other reason than casual play.  It's not a good card.  It isn't in 8Rack in Modern and I would not expect it to be in Standard either.
mtgmarketwatch,2s5wql,CorpT,1 point,Mon Jan 12 14:27:52 2015 UTC,"Spec aside, it may not be a good card in any current deck, but that can change at any time.  Like the OP said, combine Waste Not with Dark Deal (and high value graveyard fodder like Gurmag Swiftwing) and Soulflayer and you might be onto something in Standard. Modern, with the same concept, gives access to Unburial Rites and a pile of much... much more desirable reanimation targets."
mtgmarketwatch,2s5wql,OutofStep,4,Mon Jan 12 20:42:23 2015 UTC,Are you really comparing the power level of Goblin Rabblemaster and Waste Not...
mtgmarketwatch,2s5wql,CorpT,0,Mon Jan 12 20:58:38 2015 UTC,"It would have been a better choice to link Chalice of the Void, as both Chalice and Waste are quite meta specific. The overall point is valid, though. Plenty of cards have experienced spikes due to the printing of an enabler or the banning of a card that suppresses it's viability. Forked Bolt was the most recent example."
mtgmarketwatch,2s5wql,Rock-swarm,3,Mon Jan 12 21:04:09 2015 UTC,"both Chalice and Waste are quite meta specific.    In what meta does Waste Not get better?    The difference between these examples is huge.  With Waste Not you're playing a card that does nothing unless you do something to your opponent.  No one is randomly discarding things themselves.  Or not enough to come close to mattering.  So you have to construct your deck to play a card that does nothing and then play other cards that make them discard.    With Chalice, you (usually) play it in the sideboard to stop your opponent from doing something.  Would you ever side Waste Not in against someone?  Of course not.  Same with Forked Bolt.  Forked Bolt is better against random decks because it can go to the face so you can play it main and side it out if your opponent doesn't have 2 x/1 creatures you need to kill."
mtgmarketwatch,2s5wql,CorpT,0,Mon Jan 12 21:11:41 2015 UTC,"At no point did I mention the power level of those cards. All I did was point out that a $1 rare can turn into a $20 rare in the right deck. It took Rabblemaster three months to hit that mark.  Spec'ing is all about looking to the future and thinking about what a card value might become, not looking at existing decks and saying, ""it's crap, it doesn't work with anything."""
mtgmarketwatch,2s5wql,OutofStep,1 point,Mon Jan 12 21:08:09 2015 UTC,I actually like this alot not just for standard but as an inclusion in 8 rack for modern. This plus a 3rd turn dark deal can chain easily into another dark deal netting you quite a few zombies on 3rd turn. I also like how dark deal is punishing decks that play one ofs in modern. Started picking these guys up out of dollar bins and trading them at .50 all weekend.   Edit. Even if this guy does nothing I think he's at bottom and is still pretty awesome in EDH and Tiny Leaders for down the road gains.
mtgmarketwatch,2s5wql,cardlackey,3,Mon Jan 12 14:09:19 2015 UTC,"Not sure how to feel about the new edh like format, but dark deal seems like the card waste not has been waiting for. The fact that it refills your opponents hand works well in your favor. If they draw a board wipe you can most likely thoughtseize it before you pass to them, since you will probably be drawing a few cards."
mtgmarketwatch,2s5wql,cardlackey,1 point,Mon Jan 12 14:22:34 2015 UTC,Tiny leaders is fun. Less combo or lock outs. More interaction. Discard spells matter more since you aren't facing alot of the big draw lots of cards to refill your hand spells.

I think it's a little too risky to go deep on a card that might become extremely less relevant in the upcoming month. On the other hand you could just hedge and buy your play set if TC in fact remains apart of the format.
mtgmarketwatch,2s6z06,dtg99,1 point,Mon Jan 12 19:18:56 2015 UTC,"Assuming TC does get banned -    Pod gets inbred and possibly goes back to combo elements to deal with mirror and resurgence of decks like twin and tron. Foils of Melira, Reclamation Sage, and other underplayed Pod cards see a bump as a result. Merfolk and Zoo drop in popularity due to increased Pod presence, though Merfolk might be a wash since it's quite good against tron and twin. UWR tempo makes a bit of a comeback, so geist and lightning helix experience a bump (unless helix ends up in MM2). Affinity goes back to being the number 1 aggro deck. Anything not reprinted in MM2 goes up as a result.   Personally, I don't see the TC ban happening."

mtgmarketwatch,2s577h,Jaccount,1 point,Mon Jan 12 16:47:10 2015 UTC,"The point is most people don't cash out for $50. The people that bother with this are usually just looking to keep product churning through their hands- taking middling stuff and turning it into a more easy to move product. Taking that more easy to move product and turning it liquid or into cash.  If that cash isn't needed for some other real life demand, it's used to go up- be that in terms of pimp or rarity.  Many of these people will realize that it's easier to take bulk, turn bulk to cash and then turn cash into power/staples than it is to go cards-->Bulk-->Power or even Cards--->Power via trades.  For someone dealing in a higher volume of product, they're looking for the easiest, most efficient outs they can find that keeps product moving.  With product flowing through them, they're getting things for not-retail, making those trades of ""These cards"" at retail against bulk at buylist net them profit in any case, and many times people's bulk isn't ""true bulk"", so you can pick up extra value through that as well.  It's slow, time consuming and unglamorous, but it's basically picking the bones of every transaction for all the value you can get out of it, and making sure that you're always moving product."

Also, /u/SaffronOlive pointed out on Twitter that a couple of the GPT-winning decklists also ran Anafenza in the mainboard."

Perhaps the MPR version of pyroclasm, as $4 seems a little low for something that sees similar levels of play as the $10 lightning helix (I'm counting legacy play here). Darkblast has been on a steady climb, but the margins on buying in at .50 just to cash out at $1.5 seems like a waste of time. Ship has already sailed on the foils, though there's a few foil land targets in the titan bloom list that have some room for growth.  Honestly, I would focus more on what potential specs to avoid based on the likelihood of seeing a reprint in MM2, i.e. Goryo's Vengeance, Through the Breach, Linvala, etc."

mtgmarketwatch,2s5gb6,carmansandiego,4,Mon Jan 12 12:24:45 2015 UTC,"Posts like this are a recurring problem with a lot of people in MTG. You bought into a HOBBY, not a secure investment. You’re not going to get out breaking even, let alone making money…. This also doesn’t even being taking into account the time investment it will take to sell your cards, which is also a cost, whether you believe it or not.  A perfect example is my personal investment in the last few years, I spent about 2 thousand dollars on cards last year, about 60% standard (I keep up on standard on each set) and the rest on modern/edh. That 2000 dollars is literally worth like MAYBE 800-900 dollars (probably less, but im on mobile and too lazy to look at my spreadsheets). It’s gone, not coming back. My Blood Barons of Vizkopa that I bought on a “deal” for 10 dollars each when they were averaging 15 are now worth like 2$ each, and that’s fine. I accepted it as a cost of playing the game. Because when I started playing magic, “cashing out and breaking even’ wasn’t one of the reasons I used to get into it. If this is one of the reasons someone would get into magic, I have bad news for you. It’s not gonna happen. You’re not gonna come close to breaking even unless you bought a bunch of duals in the late 90s and forgot about them until now, and now you want to “cash out”. The cold hard reality is that 95% of magic cards lose value, and the other 5% seldom come close to making up that deficit.  That being said, buylisting or selling your collection to someone else is probably your best recourse. You’re not going to get close to market value at all though. Probably somewhere between 30-60% of its retail value (TCG low is a good estimate) it will be towards the higher end if you have a collection of valuable/in demand cards. However those 1$ rares are now worth a dime, those 5$ rares? Probably 1.50-2$. You can try  selling it all yourself, but its going to take a lot of work over a long time if your collection is large, and the extra money you make will probably end up not being worth the time and energy it took to sell it."

Not sure how well you go about meeting new people, but I would suggest, if you want to keep playing, to find those people who play. Organize an event yourself.

MTGSalvation also has a similar option with Market Street.

I'm ok taking the risk buying in at 8 as i don't seem them going lower barring reprint, and to not have to buy in at double or higher."

It's a shame tcgplayer and mtgstock price tracking doesn't go back to the release of AVR, because Scroll Rack went from $7 to $40 over the course of 3 days (you can see the tail end of this spike at the start of the graph here), based purely on speculation for legacy interactions with miracle cards. As we all know, scroll rack never saw play due to the adequate interaction between brainstorm and sensei's divining top. However, anyone quick enough to pull the trigger on buying scroll rack before the jump suddenly had an extremely actionable profit opportunity.  My point is, hype is often the primary driving force behind a price spike. In fact, it happens often enough that we differentiate price spikes from price corrections largely based on whether the card saw an increase in playability in line with it's hype."

While big spikes can happen, they often pail in comparison to the spikes in non rotating or eternal formats where supplies can be incredibly limited compared to standard cards.  For example, your point is great for those looking to pick up modern cards hoping they become unbanned.  My point is about people who bought into desecration demon or nightveil specter after devotion was spoiled. They spiked, but not until MBD began to dominate."

mtgmarketwatch,2rsozb,drakeblood4,3,Fri Jan 9 17:37:04 2015 UTC,"This is how I classify the banned list, as of now...  Spells associated with unfair cost reducing effects: Ancestral Vision, Mirrodin artifact lands, Blazing Shoal, Dark Depths, Dread Return, Golgari Grave Troll, Hypergenisis, Punishing Fire, Sword of the Meek  Fast mana: Chrome Mox, Cloudpost, Rite of Flame, Seething Song  Overly powerful 'fair' cards: Bloodbraid Elf, Deathrite Shaman, Glimpse of Nature, Green Sun's Zenith, Jace the Mind Sculptor, Ponder, Preordain, Skullclamp, Stoneforge Mystic, Umizawa's Jitte  Time cards: Second Sunrise, Sensei's Divining Top    Ancestral Vision is only truly unfair when you can Cascade into it or cast it T1. Without Shardless Agent it honestly isn't a devastating Cascade target, even off of BBE, and it's effect is no more powerful than Cruise, excepting that in some decks it doesn't require as large an expenditure of card equity to get.   Bloodbraid is roughly as fair as Siege Rhino. It has a slightly worse body in exchange for the potential to point your helix at something other than the face. It was most likely a martyr of Jund hamstringing in the world of Deathrite. Adding it back in probably adds variety to the power-in-a-vaccum resource denial BGx decks."
mtgmarketwatch,2rsozb,Trainer_PAC,3,Fri Jan 9 17:50:36 2015 UTC,"That ""source"" is just the normal announcement given after the release of every set. The B&R list is always updated the Monday after each set release.  While it's hard to say what will be banned or unbanned, it is almost certain that Survival will not be unbanned. It's literally a 1 card combo.   Caleb Durward did a video series on banned cards in both legacy and modern. Survival of the Fittest's videos can be found here and in his summation article he wrote:   Survival of the Fittest  Ah, the one people still blame me for. I had a blast testing Survival again. The old lines, figuring out how to maximize board presence and damage with a limited amount of green mana, came flooding back.  Unfortunately, it's just too good. Even with more maindeck graveyard and enchantment hate than was around during Survival's dominance, you can still tutor up an answer to graveyard hate and get value in response to enchantment destruction. The end result is that the fair decks just lose to Survival over and over.  Know how people complain about True-Name Nemesis being an unkillable 3/1? Well Survival tutored up a pack of unkillable 4/3s with haste for a single green each. If that wasn't good enough, it could win with Necrotic Ooze or cheat a legendary fatty into play.  Safe: 1/5 Fun: 5/5   If people want to speculate on unbannings I think Caleb Durward's work on the subject is unrivaled and people should check out his findings."

mtgmarketwatch,2rt0lj,taoofsteve88,6,Fri Jan 9 00:55:56 2015 UTC,"RTR is a sure bet. It's a good draft format and has a lot of solid cards. All of Theros block is a bad hold as the blocks draft format was generally seen as poor, and it doesn't have any cards people are pining for for eternal formats.   Khans is a great draft format, and has fetch lands so that's a fair bet.   Conspiracy is a decent hold for draft, but I'd almost say just spend that money on value cards from it and hold those. Since overall the set has low value.   Best investments right now are RTR and Khans. Then if Khans and FRF have great draft synergy and people like that I'd drop RTR and buy those two together.  To answer the question though if I had to get one box for 90 it would be RTR."
mtgmarketwatch,2rt0lj,Sniffygull,0,Fri Jan 9 01:25:24 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Speaking as a guy sitting on a case of RTR in my closet, there's simply too many modern and legacy playable in that set to not benefit from a price jump down the road. KTK is looking to have the same effect.  With all of that said, boxes gaining value over time is largely the result of the playerbase expanding. If we experience an exodus of players, then box values will stagnate."
mtgmarketwatch,2rt0lj,Rock-swarm,1 point,Fri Jan 9 01:35:13 2015 UTC,"Great insight, thanks. I know a ridiculous amount of RTR was bought by everyone, so that's why IMO card prices in RTR remain rather low compared to their playability. The main bet is that the Magic player base will grow, and as such boxes of cards with playabe staples will increase with it. By that token, would the $90 be better invested just buying up shocklands? I'm guessing yes."
mtgmarketwatch,2rt0lj,Sniffygull,1 point,Fri Jan 9 01:50:21 2015 UTC,"Pretty much. It's either going to be an influx of new players wishing for sealed product to get staples they need, or it'll go to someone who mentions they want to do a draft of RTR. I've got a box sitting just for that scenario. Might either buy another, or go into some Khans next.   MM is probably the next sure fire buy for holding."

That said, it's entire appeal is ""If you like EDH, then try this,"" which means it is basically a subdivision of EDH. This puts a big cap on its overall community size, and while it's gotten a lot of hype in like the past week, I wouldn't consider that nearly enough to invest in to make a profit off of. Hell, I'm personally putting $0 into this until it really takes off, even for my own deck."

mtgmarketwatch,2rq4dc,fyawm,1 point,Thu Jan 8 08:34:51 2015 UTC,Was the Rings of Brighthearth spike based somewhat on tinyleaders?

mtgmarketwatch,2rq4dc,jassi007,2,Thu Jan 8 09:31:48 2015 UTC,"From what I've seen of the format, it's leaning more towards aggro/tempo. Without the 4 CMC, it's really hard to make a good stuff deck. It's also really hard to assemble combos with a 49 card deck with very limited access to tutors that are efficient. It could just be the nature of a new format though."

mtgmarketwatch,2rmvqj,kahluahandcream,-2,Wed Jan 7 15:32:38 2015 UTC,considering Jace is 2$ and vraska is 1$ it would be wise to out both PWs as fast as you can! A foil version of kiora will likely be 2-3$ and the non-foil version will be in the same neighborhood.   elspeth isn't modern playable so it'll fall to 3-4$ (casual appeal)
mtgmarketwatch,2rmvqj,rp_1,6,Wed Jan 7 18:15:42 2015 UTC,"Where are you getting these estimates? You are comparing in-rotation planeswalkers vs. out of rotation non-modern playable planeswalkers.  Yes the dual decks will hurt Elspeth and Kiora, but to think Elspeth will suddenly drop from 20 to 3-4 is absurd. Once the duel decks are released, I wouldn't be surprised if Elsepth drops 5 bucks to 15, but I find it very unlikely to drop below 10 until rotation.  Now, if you are referring to after they rotate, which OP doesn't mention, they will of course drop even further."
mtgmarketwatch,2rmvqj,WigginIII,4,Wed Jan 7 19:45:01 2015 UTC,"Tons of j v v was opened for the remands. Remand still trades at like $10, so it's holding a huge percentage of that products msrp. Something good would have to show up in e v k for those walkers to drop similarity.   It should also be noted that Kiora and elspeth 6 are both cube staples, and jace and vraska aren't.   Elspeth 6 May be the best walker in edh also. Kiora is the only walker in the best color combo."
mtgmarketwatch,2rmvqj,jimini-christmas,3,Wed Jan 7 23:16:11 2015 UTC,Great additional points. I have no idea where rp_1 gets the idea that Elspeth and Kiora will drop to 3-4 bucks.
mtgmarketwatch,2rmvqj,WigginIII,0,Wed Jan 7 23:32:36 2015 UTC,where there would another card like remand or path to exile  or   rotation a few months after. rotation hits earlier and earlier and folks look to eagerly unload their cards and any shift in the meta will push them down.   in addition  Elspeth is a sub 10$ card come march (DDs cost under 12 from suppliers in bulk so there is not reason to not crack them if eslpeth is selling for 15$ until the price comes even lower. The collective value of the contents for cards over 1$ won't exceed 12$ to 15$ otherwise stores will just open them). If you see another 7-10$ card look at the remand effect. OR if you see a path to exile look at VvK on release.

mtgmarketwatch,2rnuej,CigarPete,3,Wed Jan 7 20:07:22 2015 UTC,"It's just one of those weird price differences where the paper and the MTGO prices have a huge difference between them. Normally I'd say it will correct itself in time but given that this is Standard, and that FRF is about to be released, if Sidisi Whip doesn't remain a relevant deck I don't think the price will be moving anywhere but downward until it rotates out unless it finds a new home.  Paper can take a while to catch up to MTGO values but at this point I think it's just too late for it to happen."
mtgmarketwatch,2rnuej,The_Happening2014,5,Wed Jan 7 20:23:15 2015 UTC,"Small set mythics tend to have a bigger price disparity (going both ways) from paper to online, for a host of reasons. MTGO enforces draft structure to an absolute, while local paper drafts sometimes draft double- or triple-small set drafts if pods simply want more new product. Desirable box-toppers or chase mythics can entice paper players to purchase boxes, while that's not the case on MTGO.  Of course, there's likely additional factors, but it's also possible that the paper market simply hasn't had time to catch up."
mtgmarketwatch,2rlzfb,KerrickLong,11,Wed Jan 7 08:06:32 2015 UTC,"Maintain is a strong implication, considering all 3 are mainly played in Standard, but I think the one to fall the least is Rabblemaster. If I'm not mistaken, he is the only one seeing Eternal play already.  In addition to this, Elspeth will soon be reprinted so her price will probably fall (a little more than after the announcment) before rotation already.  Even though Stormbreath and Thundermaw have 2 different effects, I would prefer Thundermaw almost every time  Correct me if I'm wrong"
mtgmarketwatch,2rlzfb,nukkes,3,Wed Jan 7 08:58:41 2015 UTC,"I agree it's extremely likely none will retain value. If I had to guess which would see the smallest percentage drop (which won't be small at all) I'd probably go with Stormbreath though. It's true that Rabblemaster has seen play as a 1-of or 2-of in Goblin lists in both Modern and Legacy but it's still a $14 core set rare whose demand is 95%+ standard driven; it'll drop like a rock. Stormbreath on the other hand is a mythic Dragon, so it has casual appeal, and is not strictly worse than Thundermaw. The ability to dodge Path to Exile is super important. I actually believe I watched Jeff Hoogland stream with it in a UWR Control shell once."
mtgmarketwatch,2rlzfb,dtg99,1 point,Wed Jan 7 10:41:16 2015 UTC,"It is true that both Dragons have upsides, this is the reason why I would suggest a similar price evolution for Stormbreath.  I have not followed the newer versions of the following decklist, therefore my informations may be outdated. I was thinking about Legacy Mono Red Prison, which is playing Rabble as one of its finishers (next to a personal preference usage of Koth, Rakka Mar, Siege-Gang + Kiki-Kiki). It is by far no Tier 1 deck, so it will not have a lot of influence on the price, just wanted to say that a decklist using it already exists ;)"
mtgmarketwatch,2rlzfb,nukkes,1 point,Wed Jan 7 11:46:43 2015 UTC,"We have SO MANY examples of Mythic Dragons just completely tanking on value if they haven't found a non-rotating home.

The only red Mythic dragon who has bucked the trend is Thundermaw Hellkite, and that's from some pretty big price memory and an amazing ETB effect."
mtgmarketwatch,2rlzfb,Manadyne,2,Wed Jan 7 14:54:25 2015 UTC,it is about whether the card is playable in other formats; none of those mythics you listed there are

mtgmarketwatch,2rlzfb,Lalagah,1 point,Wed Jan 7 14:11:15 2015 UTC,What deck is going to play Stormbreath outside of Standard that will drive $10 demand.   Will it see more play than Sphinx's Revelation? Rev is 6. Large set mythic that was a big player in standard.

mtgmarketwatch,2rlzfb,Lalagah,0,Thu Jan 8 13:56:59 2015 UTC,"Thundermaw is also a mythic dragon, is better, sees more Modern play, and comes from a set that was opened much less. It's $9."

mtgmarketwatch,2rlzfb,worldchrisis,0,Mon Jan 12 06:35:19 2015 UTC,"If souls is played after thundermaw is already out, he gets stonewalled for 4 turns. Stormbreath swings right past them."
mtgmarketwatch,2rlzfb,FailureToComply0,1 point,Mon Jan 12 07:30:58 2015 UTC,"None of them will be close to their current value, although Rabblemaster is the best bet post rotation.   It is the most playable of the three in eternal formats, although admittedly fringe, it does occasionally show up in decks like Mono-Red Moggcatcher and some Legacy Jund builds.   It's from M15, and core sets are almost always opened and redeemed less than a big fall set like Theros, so even though you'll open one Rabblemaster every two(ish) boxes of M15 and one Elspeth every three(or so) of Theros, it's likely there are less copies of Rabblemaster on the market than Elspeth or Stormbreath.   Of course, Elspeth is about to be reprinted, so there's also that."
mtgmarketwatch,2rlzfb,SaffronOlive,0,Thu Jan 8 01:04:29 2015 UTC,eslpeth's value will be destroyed by the duel deck  goblin rabble master is a 1-2$ rare once it rotates (its only really standard playable and the 1-2$ is based on casual appeal)  Stormbreath will be at least 5$ since it is a mythic dragon (if not right away a few months after)
mtgmarketwatch,2rlkvi,FranticJ3,9,Wed Jan 7 05:15:21 2015 UTC,"Atarka - 7 mana is a lot to spend on a creature with no ETB or resilience. In fact, I'm not sure I can name one that has seen play in recent memory. There are combos like this plus Xenagod, as you mentioned, but I think it's ultimately too cute. It reminds me of people raving about the Exava/Kalonian Hydra combo when the latter was spoiled. I think it's a bulk rare.  Alesha - I have no clue where this can/will fit but there's obvious upside in the ability.  There are some interesting thing you can reoccur with ETB like Hornet Queen, Clever Impersonator and etc. but such a  curve just feels wonky and Whip does it better. I assume this wants to fit in a more aggressive shell but yeah, there's upside here. This is the kind of card that gets better as more cards are added to the card pool.  I'm having trouble evaluating manifest in general but ultimately I'm leaning towards ""too gimmicky""; at least as it pertains to a manifest-centric deck.  I don't think the set is underwhelming in the slightest. Compared to THS block, I think this and KTK are clear upgrades in power level."
mtgmarketwatch,2rlkvi,dtg99,4,Wed Jan 7 07:16:46 2015 UTC,"Why would R/G monsters need a good finisher? Every non dork in the deck is a good finisher. Atarka is decent, but until Stoke the flames/jeskai tokens rotates out, it will remain under powered.   Reality shift is not a good card in general. Demands a 2 for 1 just to get rid of something. Might as well play silence the believers"
mtgmarketwatch,2rlkvi,mewcuss,1 point,Wed Jan 7 11:38:16 2015 UTC,"In regards to this set being underwhelming, I somewhat agree. I think everyone's favorite cards (Monastery Mentor and Grand Master) won't see much play outside of standard. Their standard play could hold them at $15-$20 further down the line, but anything else could break out in standard and take that place. I'm excited to see how it plays out.  So being bearish on those two makes me excited because it makes me think there is a Thragtusk, Sphinx's Rev, or Rabblemaster in there somewhere. I don't know what card it is, but I expect us to see a currently low value rare/mythinc play that role."

Think about this, it requires you to already have Jeskai Ascendancy in play, so it required another card to get the most value out if it.  Also, there is literally only 1 uncommon per set (in standard) that is valued over a dollar. M15 is the exception with Stoke and Ensoul Artifact.  To speculate on Human Defector means you are betting that this is the uncomon that will be this set's over-a-buck uncommon. It might be, but I'm a little hesitant to commit."

It seems like 3 years post is the magic number for the big price jumps. It couldn't hurt to pick up a few copies- particularly foils.  Scion I'm not sure about. It was printed a long time ago, but I think the only EDH cards that really explode in price are insanely good cards and cards also played in Legacy. I don' tthink anything about Scion is insanely good, but if we start seeing particular decks with it that can change. I'm already expecting a hefty number of T6 or sooner Scion into Atarka, World Render. Also this deck could easily pull off a Mirrorweave targeting Utvara Hellkite for the insane play.  I think picking up foil Scion of the Ur-Dragons might pan out. I'm still figuring out the mtg market but I think the price of foil could easily hit 10+ bucks. My tcg player plugin must be borked, because I just went to pick up a few copies and Foil Utvaras are ~5 bucks and foil Scions are 40. Dang."

And for cards like these, which will mostly see play in EDH, that's where the money is. EDH, Vintage, and Legacy are where foil staples can be more than 4x the price of a nonfoil, and if you're lucky enough to get a good one you hold onto it...unlike my foil Karn...and Batterskull...which I traded at ~30-50 bucks when they were in standard (to be fair, I did get an Elesh Norn out of the deal, but then I accidentally traded her)"

mtgmarketwatch,2ribj9,GHChinMTG,8,Tue Jan 6 12:28:32 2015 UTC,"I completely agree.  I think Mentor and Grandmaster are good cards, but not as good as everyone is making them out to be.  And I think people are also forgetting this set will be drafted more than the set this time last year.  I'm more interested in some of the warriors as I think w/b warriors will be a thing.  At the moment I don't see any underestimated cards that will go up in price."
mtgmarketwatch,2ribj9,alblaster,4,Tue Jan 6 14:15:22 2015 UTC,this set will be drafted more than the set this time last year   Do you have any evidence for that claim? Are there more total draft weeks of it?
mtgmarketwatch,2ribj9,drakeblood4,4,Tue Jan 6 19:04:19 2015 UTC,"There is definitely no money to be made on either card.  Their pre-sale prices are already high and both cards would need to increase in price more for flipping them to be profitable after fees.  As for playability, Soulfire Grandmater is overrated.  Monastery Mentor looks like the real deal, though.  If I were to bet on which card flops I would trade all my SGM's for Mentors at the Prerelease."
mtgmarketwatch,2ribj9,oprahlikescake,1 point,Tue Jan 6 16:23:08 2015 UTC,I would trade my SCM for Mentors too. Until I get my playset of Mentors. Then SCM for Mentors for Anafenza. And profit.
mtgmarketwatch,2ribj9,150crawfish,2,Wed Jan 7 06:52:08 2015 UTC,Monestary mentor will defiantly see modern play. The fact that the tokens have prowess is a problem. Most creatures in the best decks have < 3 toughness anyways. I don't see why that is a factor when UR delver has only creatures with that you're off toughness
mtgmarketwatch,2ribj9,ToWumbo,3,Tue Jan 6 17:34:23 2015 UTC,Triggering prowess requires a spell though...The creatures that have < 3 toughness either provide some immediate value or are cheap enough manawise to not lose too much tempo when it dies to bolt. That's how it works.
mtgmarketwatch,2ribj9,FranticJ3,1 point,Tue Jan 6 23:36:34 2015 UTC,"Agree with /u/ToWumbo. No creature in UR Delver costs more than 2, except for some builds that run Geist of Saint Traft in the sideboard. Losing a 2cc Young Pyromancer sucks, but losing a 3cc Mentor sucks even more, for a deck that only runs 18 lands."
mtgmarketwatch,2rk4v6,casperville,8,Tue Jan 6 21:59:03 2015 UTC,I have my money on it being a mythic in MM2. The set will be limited focused and will have 2 color pairing archetypes. With the introduction of SOM to MM infect will most likely be in. Skithiryx is the ideal candidate for a mythic that is limited playable while still being a set mechanic.
mtgmarketwatch,2rk4v6,Memoryjar,5,Wed Jan 7 04:17:13 2015 UTC,Bingo. Infect is going to definitely be a draftable archetype in MM2.

mtgmarketwatch,2rf0ml,WigginIII,2,Mon Jan 5 17:17:57 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't bank on manifest being a thing. Although I agree Hooded Hydra is probably safe at ~$1 since it's a mythic, likely with casual appeal, you're going to need literal library manipulation with manifest for it to see standard play. Hardcasting this isn't strong and as it stands you'll be drawing this much more often than manifesting it.  I don't think BW Warriors is going to be a thing (you left out Battle Brawler btw). I think the Hordechief is good but not so much Strikeleader/Shadowspear and ultimately I just don't think it's going to be enough. In my experience, by the time this style deck is hitting critical mass the other midrange strategies in the format are already trumping you. For a true aggro list to succeed I think it really needs to go underneath and I just don't see warriors doing that. A Mardu Aggro list did top 8 GPDEN though (I think) running Bloodsoaked."
mtgmarketwatch,2rf0ml,dtg99,1 point,Mon Jan 5 18:10:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your comments! You bring up some good points that I will need to consider going forward.  I think for BW Warriors to work, it needs Atheros. The interaction between Atheros and End Hostilities could be something we see.  Just when midrange decks are gaining more meaningful board presence, resetting the board while likely getting most of your creatures back. It might be too cute, we will have to see."
mtgmarketwatch,2rf0ml,dtg99,2,Mon Jan 5 18:27:16 2015 UTC,"Athreos does a decent job of cornering you opponent at times, much like Eidolon of the Great Revel, but my problem with it stems with the fact that your opponent ultimately gets a choice. Tapping out on T3 to cast this sometimes only results on you losing extremely valuable tempo for this type of deck. I almost feel like Grim Haruspex does a better job at providing you with gas in the face of removal. I really want Warrior tribal to be a thing because I'm kind of in love with tribal decks in general but whenever I've tested this deck I just felt like what I was doing was a lot less powerful than what my opponent was doing."

mtgmarketwatch,2rf0ml,Encendi,1 point,Mon Jan 5 17:40:04 2015 UTC,"Standard is almost exclusively what I speculate in, actually. I have some for Modern, but just like the quick turnaround and volume sales that Standard has.  But I've definitely had some hits and misses:  Hits: Whip of Erebos, Hero of Iroas, Eidolon of the Great Revel, Temple of Triumph, Burning-tree Emissary, Legion Loyalist etc.  Misses: Prognostic Sphinx, Boon Satyr, Pain Seer, etc.  I don't claim to be an expert, and I actually do it just as much for the joy/excitement as the potential financial profits, but most of my profits simply get reinvested into the game."
mtgmarketwatch,2rf0ml,Sav10r,1 point,Mon Jan 5 17:50:03 2015 UTC,"Oh, I asked because I've had a very mixed experience with speculating in Standard as well. After the Soul of Theros spike the other day, I've currently broke even, but I just think it's a very big gamble, especially at the quantities you've ordered.   On the other hand, I've speculated in Modern, Legacy, and EDH and so far my success rate is 100%. I guess my point is just that I think Standard speculations are pretty risky if you go deep."
mtgmarketwatch,2rf0ml,xcrimsonstormx,1 point,Mon Jan 5 18:05:16 2015 UTC,"It certainly can be, as with any investment. I try to pick what I think are lower risk targets, or card that, worst case scenario, I can resell and maybe only lose 25% of my initial cost. Such has been the case with Prognostic Sphinx. I picked up a ton of copies for 60c and can barely sell playsets for 2.75, so I'm breaking even after fees.  I fortunately have enough disposable income that my speculation expenditures never interfere with my monthly expenses, but I only hope that as I learn, I get better,"

mtgmarketwatch,2rf0ml,davekayaus,2,Mon Jan 5 18:51:03 2015 UTC,"It actually looks like a pretty good card to target. At GP Denver, it was seen in 3 of the top 8 decks , with a total of 11 copies. Only 1 deck of the 3 didn't run a full playset.  4/4 on turn 3 is strong, and giving another creature a +1+1 counter when it attacks is nice too. Sitting at 3.70 we can see the card is just starting to rise.   I do wonder how well it plays with FRF cards. The key will be figuring out what abzan aggro decks look like with FRF, and if Anafenza will still be a key card in the 3 drop. I imagine so."

mtgmarketwatch,2rebse,Lollipopsaurus,2,Mon Jan 5 15:40:22 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of people are holding there breath on dig.  Waiting for an announcement on a possible banning or not.  I highly suspect that the card will go up if it goes by round 1 with no banning.  Dig is a powerful card that sees play in several formats and is a long term hold.  I'm personally holding onto my English foils, hoping they go up.    Siege rhino would be a sell for me.  It sees standard and modern play,  but foil foreign cards are not typically good in these markets.  Especially standard.    Hope that helps."
mtgmarketwatch,2rebse,X87x,2,Mon Jan 5 15:31:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah I was leaning on the same thoughts for Dig, I appreciate the advice on Rhino!"

We know abrupt decay won't see a reprint in mma2015, and I doubt a reprint of thoughtseize will happen with Theros still kicking around.    I personally feel like they have more room to grow,  abrupt decay more so than thoughtseize.  This is a long term hold and not a short one."
mtgmarketwatch,2rdrk9,X87x,1 point,Mon Jan 5 07:39:32 2015 UTC,"Cool, thanks.   I've had them both since their respective set drops (well, first month or two of set dropping).. just recently got the itch to maybe move them.

mtgmarketwatch,2rdrk9,X87x,1 point,Mon Jan 5 09:31:33 2015 UTC,Yeah I get where you're coming from.  I recently traded in some pod foils to get me credit to further pimp out an EDH deck.
mtgmarketwatch,2rdrk9,Red_Beam,1 point,Mon Jan 5 14:21:06 2015 UTC,I wouldn't cash out on these two eternal staples with such a low immediate reprint risk. Hold on to them and find the funds elsewhere; unless there is no other way.  At the very least you'll be able to sell for more barring some extreme unknown circumstance.
mtgmarketwatch,2rd063,TravvyJ,3,Mon Jan 5 02:44:06 2015 UTC,"I'm very interested in this as well, as its one of my personal favorite cards. One potential thought is that copies are being grabbed up in hopes that it will be unbanned, but I think Bloodbraid Elf and Deathrite Shaman are two more likely candidates to be unbanned.   I think the more likely thing is that it sees a ton of demand in Legacy, and $20 was always pretty light for an eternal staple that's a rare in a small set. So it could just be due to vendors buying up copies to allow their investment to grow."
mtgmarketwatch,2rd063,kahluahandcream,2,Mon Jan 5 03:43:32 2015 UTC,"I think the possibilty of an unban is unlikey, as they'd probably have to ban something(s) in order to unban stoneforge. This is not to say that this isn't based on the assumption that isn't unbanned though, as the possibility of it being unbanned can cause it to go up due to hype. See FNM Bloodbraids on tcgplayer for example.  It seems like there's a stoneblade deck in legacy for every color, and this is a 4 of in every one. I would assume that any change in price is due to this demand. I would think that it could go back to its former price of $30 based on this."
mtgmarketwatch,2rd063,321orez,2,Mon Jan 5 05:57:10 2015 UTC,I think it's more likely genuine legacy demand. The Jeskai deck with stone forge got a ton of camera time and won the New Jersey GP.
mtgmarketwatch,2rd063,Theangryhermit,3,Mon Jan 5 10:59:24 2015 UTC,"I don't think SFM is anywhere near it's peak. The only threats to my mind are duel decks and commander precons, so lets look at those:  Elspeth is in an upcoming duel deck, and I don't believe we have a list for that yet. If she dodges that then you're probably safe from that angle for a while.  It dodged the C14 mono white deck, which was practically begging for it, so that's a point in its favor. iirc someone on the design team has expressed a dislike of tutors in EDH, so that's another point for it. I'd be surprised if Wizards didn't have their eyes on it though, so that's a point against it, it might just get shoehorned into C15.  Game play wise, delver variants with white and various deathblade variants are still healthy, and last I heard Death and Taxes was on the up-and-up. SCG dropping Legacy coverage is a bit troubling, but I personally feel like the format can survive without it for now. They're still doing Legacy 5ks, at the least.  Overall I think the probability of reprints is fairly low and I don't see it becoming less of a player in legacy, so it'll continue your standard Legacy creep up and maybe spike again at some point if enough people catch wind and get paranoid. So barring any radical changes, spec in if it isn't in the new duel deck, keep it until you feel like you've made enough profit, and clench your butt hole a bit every time they start posting commander precon spoilers."
mtgmarketwatch,2rd063,Notalec,-2,Mon Jan 5 03:50:07 2015 UTC,Could be reprinted in MM2015 tho.
mtgmarketwatch,2rd063,imarockyou,2,Mon Jan 5 09:41:25 2015 UTC,Banned in Modern so no.
mtgmarketwatch,2rd063,MetalFearz,2,Mon Jan 5 10:07:06 2015 UTC,It wouldn't be so bad in standard because all the equipment is so mediocre. There are no swords or Batterskulls to make it oppressive.
mtgmarketwatch,2rd063,Theangryhermit,3,Mon Jan 5 10:57:46 2015 UTC,I think people speculated that it would be in C14 and unloaded copies and since it wasn't the price rebounded. I'm not sure that it will be worth that much in the long term.
mtgmarketwatch,2rctop,Bluebruin,5,Mon Jan 5 01:46:09 2015 UTC,"I think you're better off breaking down a lot of the stuff individually. The market for people looking for fetch-less foil KTK playsets is going to be pretty small honestly. The High End Magic group on Facebook could be great - you could sell foil playsets of Sarkhan, Sorin, Cruise, etc. pretty quickly.  As a side note, I might want to grab the foil Cruises off you depending on price. Shoot me a message if you'd like."
mtgmarketwatch,2rcd4t,performa62,8,Sun Jan 4 23:09:46 2015 UTC,Abrupt decay is pretty good against dreadnaught. Like laughs in its face good.
mtgmarketwatch,2rcd4t,jimini-christmas,2,Mon Jan 5 01:45:40 2015 UTC,"This is basically the only answer you need to know. Even look at the graph you posted. Around the time Abrupt Decay would have been spoiled, PDN started its decline and for good reason.  Being on the reserve list will always keep it worth something, however it's just not competitive at the moment."
mtgmarketwatch,2rcd4t,Mediocritologist,7,Mon Jan 5 03:31:14 2015 UTC,"Your link shows that the price has been gradually ticking down for the past couple of years. The slight uptick in the past week is presumably due to manifest being spoiled.  MtgStocks shows that Stiflenought is not a thing in Legacy, with no decks found. The declining price since 2012 would appear to back this up.    I'm thinking one broken manifest effect will break things open.   I would not recommend a card spec based on a card you've just imagined. Wait to see what is actually in FRF."
mtgmarketwatch,2rcd4t,davekayaus,3,Sun Jan 4 23:36:20 2015 UTC,"I've played a lot of legacy for the last couple years and never once played against Stiflenought, although I've heard of it before. A strong blue manifest card could push this over the edge, and of course being a relatively high power-level card on the reserved list means people should keep a close eye on him. That said, manifest simply existing does not make this card any better than he was before. There needs to be something playable, and in that respect we'll all just have to wait and see."
mtgmarketwatch,2rcd4t,Rockenos,3,Mon Jan 5 02:05:07 2015 UTC,"If dreadnought budges due to manifest it will be from the casual market.   Manifest requires library manipulation to be good. If you're looking for another cheat effect outside stifle, Trickbind does the same thing at the same cmc and doesn't require a 3rd color.   As someone already mentioned decay was the downfall of the deck. However it is in a better spot recently with ur delver floating around as it laughs at bolts and yp tokens.   Edit: if dreadnought didn't spike after Varolz/scavenge was printed I don't expect anything to see anything from manifest."

mtgmarketwatch,2r8rfr,Chosler88,1 point,Thu Jan 8 11:09:57 2015 UTC,"Honestly, this is just going to continue until WotC decides to reprint these cards in a meaningful way. WotC tries very, very hard to control the secondary market, and are in many ways, financially motivated to keep the secondary market price of cards high. The most meaningful way for them to ensure that cards maintain their prices is to artificially limit supply by not reprinting key cards, jacking up MSRP on all reprint sets, lowering print runs of some products, making the 'best' constructed cards mythic or rare, and doling out expensive reprints one at a time.   I am not saying that what these counterfeiters are doing is good, and it is by no means legal, however, they are trying to fulfill demand in a market where the goods are artificially scarce. The will continue to counterfeit Magic cards, and will get better and better at it until it is no longer profitable to do so."

mtgmarketwatch,2r8koq,Skizzik9575,3,Sat Jan 3 21:55:05 2015 UTC,"It sorta sounds like you are chasing the FotM standard build, which inherently puts you in a position to be spending to buy high value in demand cards for their near peek price. Having jeskai but building sidsiwhip now might just lead you to trying to build something else in 2 months.   Jeskai has a lot of variants right now, so that isn't a bad idea to stick with. Rabble master is also played in other decks that will likely want to keep it at the 3 drop, so I don't see it tanking. But sure, it could drop some.   Although if you are absolutely determined to win FNM every week or grind PTQs you will want to be playing the top deck. You will need to find a balance between your aspirations and your disposable income."
mtgmarketwatch,2r8koq,WigginIII,1 point,Sat Jan 3 22:04:55 2015 UTC,"What you're saying makes sense. My goal isn't to chase the FotM, I'm just trying to win at my local store by playing the strongest cards. I'd rather just build whatever deck has the most chance at winning the most times regardless of what it is. I could take what it will cost me to upgrade ascendancy heroic into tokens and buy the majority of what I need for another top tier deck like sidisi, or abzan, or even like the RW aggressive list I've seen around very recently. Those options plus the fact that a new set is coming out, so I'm just looking for opinions :)"
mtgmarketwatch,2r8koq,cd62936,2,Sun Jan 4 02:30:59 2015 UTC,"I think its unlikely that Rabblemaster is going to drop off heavily due to the Monastery Mentor, but I would think you may be better off waiting on the Rabblemasters if you are willing to do so.    If the Mentor is a huge bust I would not expect Rabblemaster to see any kind of significant bump in price, remember we are probably  already past the traditional top of prices for core sets cards even good ones like Rabblemaster.   On the other hand if the Mentor is just incredible and starts replacing Rabblemaster in several decks then you will see at least a noticeable movement down.  Besides that you may decide post-release that the Mentor is what you would prefer over the Rabblemasters, in which case, if you already bought the Rabblemasters, you then have a card that's losing value that you are trying to trade for a card that will probably be fairly expensive.   So your two different possibilities if you wait till after release, are Rabblemasters stay about the same maybe go up a little bit, or they make a move down and you can pick them up at a better price.  I think it really depends on whether you are willing to be patient to see if you can get them at a few bucks a piece cheaper.    I think the most likely result is they go down a little bit mostly because there will be another option for the decks Rabblemasters are in, plus the fact that Rabblemaster is almost halfway through its time in standard if I am not mistaken."
mtgmarketwatch,2r8koq,JakeTheSheepy,1 point,Sat Jan 3 22:08:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your input. So the idea here is that rabblemaster more or less only has room to go down, so if I can hold off it could be to my benefit. The few bucks a piece cheaper isn't honestly a huge deal to be honest! I am just trying to avoid spending 60 or whatever on them now and have the set be worth 30 or worse after FRF.   That's a good point about the mentor maybe just being another thing I'll want to spend a ton of money on if it ends up being good."
mtgmarketwatch,2r8koq,JakeTheSheepy,2,Sun Jan 4 02:37:14 2015 UTC,"I think the mentor will see play in tokens, I don't know if it will replace rabble master, be a 2-2 split, or just cram a couple in there somewhere Watanabe's list is really tight and having red tokens out to convoke stoke the flames is important to the game plan. So if you want to play tokens, get the rabble masters. They may go down in price, they may not. I don't think they will tank to 3.00 or anything like that. If you buy them and start winning, your prizes will make up for any loss that happens from a price change."
mtgmarketwatch,2r8koq,Encendi,1 point,Sun Jan 4 05:40:46 2015 UTC,"Seems like a good point! I guess I imagine the mentor probably ending up in a different list that's more optimized to take advantage of cantrips and cheap stuff. But hell what do I know! It seems too good to not see play in some shape or form.   I imagine that the current tokens list would probably see seeker of the way replaced with the other mythic that got spoiled, which seems like it is a strictly better 2 drop to use, but if that happens it'll just make the list significantly more expensive and nothing else in it suffers as a result."

mtgmarketwatch,2r8o3h,theenduser,1 point,Sun Jan 4 00:05:56 2015 UTC,"If you want to get good at limited the best way is to participate in drafts at your local game store - that way you're getting more cards plus hopefully getting better at limited strategies.  With constructed, you might want to take a look at winning deck lists and see which one appeals the most to you and then just buy the cards for that deck (or trade for those cards)."
mtgmarketwatch,2r8o3h,theenduser,1 point,Sun Jan 4 00:13:40 2015 UTC,The only problem with trying to participate in drafts at my local game store is that I don have one anywhere near me that does tournaments.  There is a Hastings that has a group that plays but they either do Commander or Modern.
mtgmarketwatch,2r8o3h,blindfremen,2,Sun Jan 4 01:25:01 2015 UTC,"That's too bad. If you were able to round up enough players (at least 8) in your area that are in interested in drafting on a regular basis, most game stores will support that.  I'm fortunate to have a LGS that regularly has 4 drafts a week (2 on Friday night and 2 on Saturday night). I usually try to make it one of those days."

mtgmarketwatch,2r7qnk,TheCello,8,Sat Jan 3 17:01:15 2015 UTC,"None of the cards spoiled really point in that direction. There's a noticeable lack of library manipulation in FRF, which is what you would want in order to make manifest a viable strategy in Standard. Very few of the morph cards in KTK have broken into standard, and only hooded hydra has the theoretical power level to make trail of mysteries a good mechanic.  Just imagine sample hands where you can beat something like Jeskai tokens without seeing trail of mysteries on turn 2. Also, the possibility of having trail of mysteries but no cards in hand to synergize with the effect.  Jeskai ascendancy works extremely well with dudes in play and spells in hand, and it's generic power is why it sees play. Trail of mystery fits all the hallmarks of Rosewater's gimmicky mechanic-as-an-enchantment cards that are fun in limited, but horribly underpowered or overcosted in constructed play."
mtgmarketwatch,2r7qnk,Rock-swarm,1 point,Sat Jan 3 17:09:08 2015 UTC,I can see a possibility of it hitting successfully due to the fact it feeds mana ramp as well as makes the creature 4 or great trigger. Dual use for 2 splashable sounds pretty good to me.
mtgmarketwatch,2r7qnk,earthbinder,1 point,Wed Jan 7 19:02:44 2015 UTC,I picked up 10 because at $0.30 they're awfully low and between Fate Reforged and Dragons of Tarkir there's plenty of room for something to happen that makes it go up a bit.  I'm not deluded enough to think that that it's going to be a $5 card or even a $2.50 card but it has enough casual appeal that 10 are worth a $4 investment and will probably be reasonable trade filler even if it peaks at $0.50 or so.  Can I also recommend Crucible of Fire at ~$0.40?

I don't think it's a coincidence that the spike began to occur almost directly after BBD piloted the deck in the top 4 of the Players' Championship. It was always apart of the meta but it just recently became the Abzan thing to do online. Ultimately, the spike makes sense because Anafenza is a 4-of mythic in the most popular deck; I'm just not quite sure how that will translate to paper if at all.  EDIT: I'm watching GP Denver right now and word is Abzan Aggro is everywhere."
mtgmarketwatch,2r4vw7,dtg99,1 point,Fri Jan 2 21:12:36 2015 UTC,Anafenza is a reaction to the hornet queen whip decks which I expect we'll see die off when fate reforged comes out somehow.

mtgmarketwatch,2r4vw7,beam1985,-1,Sat Jan 3 06:37:18 2015 UTC,"I personally think she's a cute 1-of in Modern Pod.  She is great against graveyard strategies that plan to use the graveyard, (Living End, other Pod decks, even UR delver plans to use its creature for delve).  It's a 3 mana 4/4 that can make other creatures bigger. (You always have dudes in pod). Dodges bolt, especially important in UR delver meta.  It can favorably block almost anything in the format. Against aggro they struggle to attack into it.  It's green for chord."
mtgmarketwatch,2r5n17,EsportsLottery,2,Sat Jan 3 00:48:40 2015 UTC,"I think the main question is will the demand for Modern staples really increase with this second Modern Masters ? I checked the supply for cards and I think we have way too many copies compared to demand since Innistrad. The demand seems saturated. The supply of Innistrad staples is slightly above spiking levels. If there is a slight increase in Modern playerbase it might be enough for modern staples of Innistrad to spike. I'm particularly interested in Snapcaster who wasn't reprinted yet and if a spike occur I would like to get rid of them if they (finally) reach 40 euros.   Then there is RtR which has far far more supply. The supply for steam vents is much lower than other ravlands and seems to be the only ravland to speculate onto, particularly the old shockland which has extremely low supply. I wouldn't be surprised to see it go to the 20 euros range within the year. There is also abrupt decay but the supply is huge and there needs to be a lot more players in the format to make it worth it. It will slowly creep like snapcaster did because of its power and playability.  Voice of resurgence seems also quite good but dependant of the success of one deck. The supply is a bit higher than it should be to spike, but Modern Masters 2 can help if more players build Pod.  But what I fear now is that the huge growth that we have seen the last years is really coming to an end and the demand is not sufficient to make cards spike because of their scarcity. Great cards from new sets have a hard time spiking. And most spikes occur in format defining staples in small sets, or foils, or old editions. (Printing quantities have started becoming huge since innistrad and most opportunities can be found in older sets because of scarcity)."
mtgmarketwatch,2r5n17,Anthares9,2,Sat Jan 3 15:31:39 2015 UTC,"The reason ISD staples haven't spiked is because most of the playable modern cards from that block were printed AFTER modern's existence as a format, which means players were already tinkering with those cards and discovering their playability before they rotated out of standard. Everyone knew snapcaster and LotV were going to be modern all-stars before they left standard, so they experienced a very minor dip after rotation compared to things like bloodline keeper or garruk relentless.  The growth of the playerbase for modern is still substantial, it's just no longer experiencing massive meta shifts due to new tech (treasure cruise and Siege Rhino being the exceptions) or impactful bannings. UR Delver is cheap because it has an insanely high percentage of uncommon cards in it's 75 compared to other decks. It's the same reason affinity has always been cheap."

I think that the cards that have the best chances of increasing in price are some of the $2-10 cards in those sets that see play in Modern and Legacy. Snapscasters, Lilis, Caverns etc. will surely rise some with more demand, but I think that there is more room for growth in some of the cards that are currently lower cost.   Supreme Verdict, Young Pyromancer, Geist of Saint Traft, Shocklands, Deathrite Shaman, Scavenging Ooze, Rest in Peace, Abrupt Decay, Restoration Angel.  I personally think that these cards have room to grow, some have already started to rise, and I have bought/traded into some of each since they have been out of standard."

mtgmarketwatch,2r4pnl,shammikaze,5,Fri Jan 2 20:04:20 2015 UTC,"I feel like a lot of the pre-order prices are too high at the moment to get any kind of profit on.  If there's something that's only $1 or $2 it could be a good spec target, but I wouldn't go higher than that.  I'd wait until the set comes out to buy some of the undercosted cards.    Some of the warrior cards and the phoenix have caught my eye.  I really think the b/w warrior deck will be a thing as wizards keep pushing it.  The phoenix reminds me of chandra's phoenix and should see some play.  Chandra's Phoenix was one of the best phoenix's printed for competitive play.  I think this card will easily be worth more than $5.  One word of caution.  This set will be in rotation longer than other mid-year sets, so more packs will get open.  So even if something sees a lot of play tons of copies could keep the price down.  Personally if I see something spike or I end up with a pricy card I'll sell/trade it quickly, because I don't see prices staying very high.  I'm also more conserative.  If I see profit I'll take it, unless it's a modern/legacy card."

mtgmarketwatch,2r4pnl,FranticJ3,2,Fri Jan 2 20:51:29 2015 UTC,"Flamewake seems to be a very good phoenix.  I see it growing from $2 to around $3.50.  It's pretty good in Mardu (See: Butcher of the Horde).  The real driving force behind it will be if that Ferocious trigger can work.  In RUG it will always work but RUG is so far the worst color pie in standard from what I've seen.  In Mardu it can work but the cards it can work with don't see much play.  Typically pre-order prices are much higher.  KTK I bought in on $.50 Crackling Dooms and they spiked to nearly $4 a copy so cheap stuff like that can be good to get in on.  I only agree with Flamewake and Shu Yun.  Jeskai is going to be bonkers with Monastery Mentor giving all kinds of prowess tokens.  Casting a stoke before damage in combat to give an unblocked token with prowess double strike is a good thing to think about.  Him also having prowess helps as well.  Supplant Form doesn't seem too competitive and looks like a bulk rare to me. A 6 cost clone seems pretty lame, especially when the stuff that you'll typically be copying have good ETB effects (Seige Rhino or Wingmate Roc) which means the opponent will benefit from them.  Dromoka requires other dragons and will only be run in Abzan unless DTK completely screws up the clans  Daghatar is really 50/50 for me.  He works well with Anafenza but at the same time Abzan's 4 cost is rather clogged if memory serves me right.  He'd be a 1 of or 2 of IMO  Dragonscale is in the same boat as Daghatar.  4 cost Abzan girl who has a good effect but can you afford to run 3 or 4?  Citadel Siege is a bit underwhelming in power.  2 counters is nice but the second ability is pretty meh.  Sure if you're facing a deck with 1 creature focus then it's good but 9/10 times you'll use the Khans ability, in which case why not run the last 2 cards since they're all fighting for the 4cmc slot?"
mtgmarketwatch,2r4pnl,FranticJ3,1 point,Fri Jan 2 21:34:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response!  Here are my counter-points, or whatever.     Supplant Form - A 6 cost clone seems pretty lame, especially when the stuff that you'll typically be copying have good ETB effects   Note also that you can return something your opponent controls AND get a copy of that creature.  It doesn't have to be yours.  This is removal AND board power.     Dromoka requires other dragons   This is true, but also remember that the next set to release will contain ""more dragons per pack than any other set ever"", which tops the previous best at ~18% chance to get a dragon in a pack.  She may not be amazing immediately, but I suspect she'll rise suddenly at some point.  Also keep in mind that even if it's only her attacking, she still bolsters 2, which is amazing given the way green/white is starting to look.  I think we'll see her played lightly (maybe 1-2 in decks currently) right off the bat, but maybe more heavily next set.     Shu Yun   His price has tripled since I posted this.  He now costs $2.     Daghatar - He works well with Anafenza but at the same time Abzan's 4 cost is rather clogged if memory serves me right.   I also have mixed feelings on Daghatar.  The thing is, he works well with enough cards that you could actually build a deck focused on him.  Hardened Scales allows you to pay 3 mana to proliferate a counter (you could turn one counter into 5 counters if you happen to have 4 Scales in play).  He also lets you steal counters from your enemy, which helps shut down other decks like abzan.     Citadel Siege - 2 counters is nice but the second ability is pretty meh.   I think we'll see the second ability played in more Blue/White decks than Green/White decks.  It looks like blue is going to have a lot of way to control things.    It may just stay the same in price."

mtgmarketwatch,2r3x1h,Tromni,4,Fri Jan 2 15:58:13 2015 UTC,"Just as importantly, remember that less than a sliver of the total cards released since Alara block have maintained their release price during their stay in standard, much less gained in value. If you have that ""post-rotation staple"" vibe going for a certain card, the overwhelming odds dictate that you can wait to pick them up. Elesh norn is the best example in recent memory. She was as low as 6 bucks just before ZEN block rotated out, even after unburial rites had been spoiled. Here's the timeline of her price history (slide the graph all the way back to her release at NPH). She pre-ordered at an overhyped price, dipped, then had some gains during her release, then dipped again until just before the release of Innistrad.  I would strongly advise people to watch the mythics from FRF that ""feel"" playable, but don't see much standard play right off the bat. Those are your prime spec targets. Maybe they just need a critical mass of synergistic spells. Maybe they need an enabler (like elesh norn and Unburial Rites + grisly salvage). Maybe they just need the casual crowd to find some cute EDH interaction. The important part is to recognize potential."
mtgmarketwatch,2r3x1h,Rock-swarm,1 point,Fri Jan 2 17:26:28 2015 UTC,"Also, this consideration will be the norm for all sets moving forward, with twice yearly rotation.  If a card becomes useful in Standard after a rotation, you'll have maybe three months to profit.  I wonder if this will make Standard card prices more vulnerable to spikes and crashes?"
mtgmarketwatch,2r3x1h,davekayaus,2,Fri Jan 2 23:19:25 2015 UTC,"I've always thought the two ways to make money on cards is to either a) buy into a standard card before rotation or just before a PT or b) buy cards that should be/are eternal staples after they rotate from standard and play the long game.  Now that means there will be more chance to pick up these cards from scenario (a) but you just need to be able to sell all those cards as soon as they spike, which is something you should be doing anyway.  Thoughts?"
mtgmarketwatch,2r3x1h,Shazbah91,2,Sat Jan 3 01:53:30 2015 UTC,"I've always been a fan of the long game too. If card has enough multi-format demand it will always rise. Reprints can cause a kink but after that it reverts to trend, sometimes very quickly.  Look at the Fetchlands. Reprinted a couple of months ago, still being opened like crazy (I first picked a Polluted Delta list night) and the price is ticking up on the best two.  If you don't like the idea of reprints then Legacy/Vintage staples on the reserved list are good holds."
mtgmarketwatch,2r6t42,EsportsLottery,5,Sat Jan 3 08:15:57 2015 UTC,"It seems like the time to pick this card up was over a year ago, when it was five dollars. Why buy now when it has doubled?  It sees play as a 1-of in what you might charitable describe as a fringe deck in modern. No doubt it also has appeal in Commander... like almost everything.  Glimpse of Nature is from the same set, has legacy appeal, and has never yet been reprinted. It is sitting at $25, but I can't see Minamo doing this.  Now would be a poor time to spec buy anything that could be reprinted in six months time. Wait for the MM15 spoiler to be complete, then decide on your modern specs is my call."
mtgmarketwatch,2r6t42,davekayaus,2,Sat Jan 3 08:36:22 2015 UTC,"It also feels like a card waiting to show up in a commander precon, which is another reason I don't feel like taking the risk."
mtgmarketwatch,2r6t42,mtd14,5,Sat Jan 3 09:01:48 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I wouldn't spec on this for multiple reasons:    It's already approaching the level the EDH demand should keep it at. Looking at other similar staples in monoblue, it seems to be in the right area. Merfolk is such a meta tunable platform, I don't see it's inclusion into random lists as tech to be that big of a deal.  The idea it won't be in MM2 is pretty absurd. They printed plenty of commander staples that have little to no modern playability in MMA because they were good in the limited. To boot, if you wanted to hold it long, there's a pretty good chance it could pop back up in C15.  The only scenario I could see where it would just jump by another 100-200% on EDH demand would be printing of a monoblue legend that has something like ""Tap FwipFwap, untap up to two target lands. More rules text for value"". Something that makes Minamo the scarce half of a new way for monoblue to be absurd. Wasteland makes it ""worse"" than an island in legacy unless you are in a boardstate where you are expecting Choke or a crazy fringe strategy."
mtgmarketwatch,2r6t42,MerryChoppins,2,Sat Jan 3 11:13:04 2015 UTC,"I like it as a card as I can already imagine some shenanigans. Quick question, if stock is so low, where would you get yours from? Is scouring eBay for all the decent priced ones a legit way to go about it"
mtgmarketwatch,2r6t42,tiorzol,1 point,Sat Jan 3 08:37:47 2015 UTC,"I'm feeling the demand is driven almost entirely from Commander, as it's good in any deck running Blue.  Give your commander psuedo Vigilance?  Political implications?"

It's a card that has a growth potential with every future set, as every set will have new Legendary cards for it to interact with.  Think about Goryo's Vengeance; its library of tricks just gets bigger with every new set.  Minamo, School at Water's Edge is the same way.  It's one of those cards where we might not know exactly what's coming to make it bah-roken, but we can know with certainty that it's only getting better."
mtgmarketwatch,2r6t42,Manadyne,0,Sat Jan 3 16:37:52 2015 UTC,I just think that MM2 will have merfolks in it and with mutavault dropping and a probable aether vial in mm2 I see people getting into merfolk.  As a 1 of it's not a big card but it will see some interest rise.  Also the fact there are so few copies out there makes a small increase in demand have bigger price swings.    IT really just needs a push.   When there are hardly any copies available it's a good sign for a card.

mtgmarketwatch,2r3fu4,cardlackey,2,Fri Jan 2 12:39:34 2015 UTC,"Craiglist seems terrible these days.

mtgmarketwatch,2r3zsm,tronacus,5,Fri Jan 2 16:24:14 2015 UTC,Maybe 1 card in the set will hold/gain value. Everything else drops by at least 1/2. Happens every release.

Thanks for giving me something awesome to listen to at work! I wish you guys had longer or more frequent podcasts, especially during spoiler season! I'd like to hear more about what you guys think of the new cards :).  Edit: also, erm... hi! Love the podcast, been listening to it at work every day since I discovered it (though im quickly running out of relevant episodes as I go further and further back into the casts history), do any of you have recommendations for other audio based finance news/discussion I can listen to while at work?"
mtgmarketwatch,2r35gb,myemfar,3,Sat Jan 3 12:25:23 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the kind words! I know we argue quite a bit, and Jason especially, but the truth we do it because we get along so well. Somehow. Even after 129 episodes at this point. The ""we all hate each other"" is a running joke with us since we do disagree quite a bit at times on cards.   We do tend to run longer during spoiler season, and the set review is usually 2ish hours, but we actively try to schedule out about an hour otherwise. That way people can usually knock it out on their commute or whatever, and they know what to expect when they start it up. It also helps us stay on point better.   As for other suggestions, I would suggest checking out our episode 100. It was a collection of the best moments from the first 99 episodes, and that saves you from going back too far. Other than that, there's not too much else. We always say we're the best financial cast because we're the only financial cast. But I would check out the interview series on the free side of QUiet Speculation. There's only a few episodes and I don't have a link handy atm but it's with store owners and is also good.

While there are honest sellers on eBay, there are plenty that will cancel your preorder if your card is a winner. Speculating on preorders is already generally a losing proposition, and when you consider that a significant number of sellers only honor their preorder if your card goes down in price, it's enough to make me use only the most reputable retailers if I feel strongly enough about a card to preorder."

mtgmarketwatch,2r1e1s,jimini-christmas,3,Fri Jan 2 02:44:50 2015 UTC,I don't see much in there that is relevant outside of standard.  It's not a set many people will think back on fondly so I have a feeling sealed Nyx product would be nearly as lacklustre as sealed Dragons Maze.

mtgmarketwatch,2r1e1s,nisher,2,Fri Jan 2 18:46:56 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think you'd be better of cracking them now and selling.   You have three of the most expensive non-fetch lands: Mana Confluence, Temple of Epiphany, Temple of Malady. Those will all drop in rotation.  You have Ajani which sees a little Standard play. Keranos is seeing the SB in Modern. Both Eidolons (GR and Blossoms) see play in Modern and Standard, respectively. Pharika is in Whip and Constellations decks. Iroas, Kruphix and Athreos have EDH demand.  It certainly has more upside than BNG, but you'll be banking on scarcity rather than power-level."
mtgmarketwatch,2r1bnm,mtd14,5,Thu Jan 1 21:17:40 2015 UTC,"Definitely the most underwhelming Mythic so far in my eyes. UB Control has better options and the whole ""cast from exile"" seems more like a cute trick than a game changer. It might find a slot or two in Whip or in decks running Soulflayer but I'd imagine the sheer desirability of the two white mythics and Ugin is going to keep the price low on this one."
mtgmarketwatch,2r1bnm,kahluahandcream,2,Thu Jan 1 22:20:55 2015 UTC,"Whip board states (in the mirror) do tend to get gummed up, reaching parity until someone goes over the top with Queen or rips a Doomwake to get through opposing bees and etc. I know people have tested cards that grant evasion like Thassa and Nylea in earlier iterations of the deck for just that reason so this probably merits testing. My problem with it is that Whip wants to utilize it very specifically (rarely ever draw it, mostly just combo with Whip off of mill) and it could very likely be useless in a decent percentage of match-ups. Ultimately, whether or not this sees play will have a lot to with with how the meta shakes out post FRF. If it looks anything like our current meta I think it has a chance, however."

mtgmarketwatch,2qznk3,bfro,1 point,Thu Jan 1 15:06:20 2015 UTC,"They didn't have the opportunity to buy into Kalonian Hydra at $1.  Mistcutter Hydra is a standard irrelevant large set rare and it's at $1 tcg mid. There's enough casual appeal to think that there's very little downside on a mythic Hydra at $1.50, and if it hits in Standard you get to triple your money (or more)."
mtgmarketwatch,2qznk3,Tromni,0,Fri Jan 2 16:07:00 2015 UTC,Polukranos gained a big price bump between m15 and just after khans.
mtgmarketwatch,2qznk3,Cooldude100,-1,Thu Jan 1 17:08:32 2015 UTC,Polukranos is also the most straightforward hydra ever and the only one that I know of that beats the vanilla test. Hooded hydra is another gimicky hydra. There are better things you could do with a dollar.
mtgmarketwatch,2qznk3,jassi007,0,Thu Jan 1 18:10:27 2015 UTC,I dont disagree with any of your points. I was just pointing out the flaw in the statement about there never being a hydra lining anyone's pockets.
mtgmarketwatch,2qzkpc,dtg99,6,Thu Jan 1 06:02:35 2015 UTC,"tl;dr: wait a month and pick this up for 6-10.  Relax.  This is not going to be a $40 card. The only $40 card recently was Nissa, Worldwaker, and only for a short while. Were you paying $40 for Nissa?  In the three most recent sets (Khans, M15, Journey) even $20 has been too much for most Mythics to hold.  This card will likely see play. It's more niche than Rabblemaster as the goblin passively creates tokens, while the Mentor gives you a token as an additional effect to using a card.   Expect the price of this card to run roughly parallel to that of Wingmate Roc."
mtgmarketwatch,2qzkpc,davekayaus,1 point,Thu Jan 1 07:25:14 2015 UTC,"Also brimaz. I think the brimaz effect is a troubling one, BUT this set will be drafted/opened way more than bng, so I would not be surprised to see it drop to 10."
mtgmarketwatch,2qzkpc,mewcuss,1 point,Thu Jan 1 14:36:31 2015 UTC,The only way this set could be drafted and opened worse than BNG would be if it makes both draft environments untenable and has functionally no value.
mtgmarketwatch,2qzkpc,drakeblood4,1 point,Fri Jan 2 01:43:47 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info. I made a post asking about this and got down voted.
mtgmarketwatch,2qzkpc,tronacus,2,Fri Jan 2 19:43:35 2015 UTC,"If you spec on any preorder and end up hitting the right one, I almost guarantee that it will be a rare, not a mythic"
mtgmarketwatch,2qzkpc,321orez,1 point,Thu Jan 1 19:30:54 2015 UTC,Generally I agree as your ROI on a rare that hits is going to be larger than a mythic a good percentage of the time but there are exceptions. I'm usually of the belief that pre-ordering is by and large and trap but I believe the power level of this card to be super high. I wouldn't be surprised if it saw near ubiquitous play within its color in standard.
mtgmarketwatch,2qzkpc,Sav10r,4,Thu Jan 1 19:48:35 2015 UTC,"This card means we'll likely see a downturn in prices of Rabblemaster as this card looks to easily replace that card.   I think this one might be a ""Must Buy at Lowest Price Possible"".   EDIT: We might see this card become a victim of it's own success. We are going to see sooooo many Drown in Sorrows and Anger of the Gods in Standard."
mtgmarketwatch,2qzkpc,Hammunition,4,Thu Jan 1 06:36:41 2015 UTC,"This is nowhere near as good as Rabblemaster. Rabblemaster makes tokens with no effort, and can kill your opponent by itself in three turns.  Generally you will need 5 mana to play this and a spell in the same turn, so if your opponent has an answer, it's unlikely you will get anything out of the Mentor. At least with Rabblemaster, your opponent could be tapped out, and you will end up with a token left over.  It's not a terrible card, but it's not a 4 of in multiple decks, and should drop quickly."
mtgmarketwatch,2qzkpc,mtg_liebestod,-3,Thu Jan 1 11:08:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I quickly came to all of the same conclusions as you. Ultimately, I could see this cards trajectory mimicking that of Voice of Resurgence as it's a small set mythic with non-standard implications. It was pre-ordering at 19.99 initially on SCG but was quickly sold out. If this card is as good as it appears to be on paper, I could see it push $40-50 in similar fashion."
mtgmarketwatch,2qzkpc,mtg_liebestod,6,Thu Jan 1 06:58:24 2015 UTC,"VoR was expensive largely because DGM was disappointing and there weren't any other chase rare/mythics. FRF doesn't look like it's going to be DGM in this regard, and expecting a $40 price tag seems crazy unless you think the rest of FRF is going to be bulk."
mtgmarketwatch,2qzkpc,321orez,-1,Thu Jan 1 07:13:07 2015 UTC,It's true FRF will be opened quite a bit more and value is likely to be more dispersed throughout the set but Voice also sustained a rather hefty price tag even when it's demand was mostly modern driven. I think Mentor will make a bigger impact on standard during it's tenure and possiblly similar non-standard impact. I don't think $40 is absolutely insane.
mtgmarketwatch,2qzkpc,Sav10r,3,Thu Jan 1 07:24:22 2015 UTC,"I think the probability of it hitting $40 is sufficiently low that it would be insane to buy in at $20. That's basically saying that this will be the chase rare of FRF, when we only know what 6/10 mythics are! Is Soulfire Grand Master chopped liver now?"
mtgmarketwatch,2qzkpc,MetalFearz,0,Thu Jan 1 07:29:48 2015 UTC,"To be completely honest I think this blows Soulfire out of the water. I don't know, maybe I'm completely off on it's power level but I can see this being played in Jeskai, Mardu, Heroic, Control shells and etc. Full disclosure, I don't own a single paper card; I speculate on mtgo. I pre-ordered a set of these for $80."
mtgmarketwatch,2qzkpc,Rock-swarm,1 point,Thu Jan 1 07:33:38 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Comparing a set to DGM is not a good sign. DGM was terrible, if i recall correctly, a token is more valuable than almost any card in the set, while this set seems solid so far.This card is very powerful, but pushing what it is at preorder for long is unlikely.  I'd be in at 10$ if it sees consistent standard play."
mtgmarketwatch,2qzkpc,blindfremen,0,Thu Jan 1 07:15:05 2015 UTC,Yeah absolutely. I'd definitely pre-order 4X of these at $20 a piece.
mtgmarketwatch,2qzkpc,crminshaw,5,Thu Jan 1 07:03:53 2015 UTC,"Buying at 20$ is a stupid move, look at KTK, how many cards went up after release ? Dig through time and Sorin maybe. Everything else was overpriced."
mtgmarketwatch,2qzkpc,Sniffygull,0,Thu Jan 1 13:21:03 2015 UTC,"KTK is less than ideal in terms of pricing examples. Try looking at chase mythics in recent small sets, like Dragon's Maze and Born of the Gods."
mtgmarketwatch,2qzkpc,mtd14,2,Thu Jan 1 17:18:52 2015 UTC,"Don't look at those sets since they sucked. FRF looks like it will have many more playables, not to mention ~2x the amount drafted."

mtgmarketwatch,2qzkpc,Rock-swarm,1 point,Thu Jan 1 12:44:09 2015 UTC,"Do drafts and crack in packs. That's about the only way I'd invest in it. The hype is real, it's like a better young pyromancer for white. And a U/W deck with it could probably do some crazy stuff. But paying $20 a piece isn't economical to begin with.   Wingmate Roc is a good price gauge for it I'd say. This kid will for sure sit at a decent level, but I can't imagine that being higher than $30. And having to throw down a couple hundred for a simple 100 dollar gain is dubious at best.   The real investment right now is Anger of the Gods and Drown in Sorrow. Get those cheap and in trade then sell them when this puppy starts going off."
mtgmarketwatch,2qz5od,MechaTech,5,Thu Jan 1 02:37:12 2015 UTC,"The following is based on prices I pay at my store, and is basically industry standard.   Buylist for the C/U is $5/k, and you're going to get to pick them. Paying $6-7/k seems fine, but no more.   I don't usually pay more for foils unless they are specifically good, but buylist is usually 3-5 cents per. Buylist for bulk rares is .10 so you obviously can't lose at that price. Given 500 rares and another 6k unpicked, I would not pay more than $150 sight unseen, and $100 would be my opening offer, with moving up only occurring if I see a few things while meeting up.   It sounds like this could be a pretty good collection that could net you $1k, so paying $200 would work out. Or it could be beaten-up cards, or picked, or not as many rares as he says. You don't know sight unseen, so you have to protect yourself first."
mtgmarketwatch,2qz5od,Chosler88,5,Thu Jan 1 18:58:18 2015 UTC,"I thought the going buylist price was $1 per 1000 unsorted but I rarely actually sell so maybe I remember wrong.  Dime per rare sounds right.  Never heard a rule of thumb for foils.    Your estimate  600*.1=$60  6400/1000*8=48+3.2=51.2  Total=$111.2.  Bit of a lowball compared to his asking price.  Mine would be more so at 66.4.  Yours is probably a reasonable blind estimate (I would still wait for a second opinion on commons and foils though).  Explain your estimation method, offer a little over that and explain that most stores can't offer much more.  If you had a chance to flip through cards, you can point out some ones that are worth something to show that you have the knowledge to give a reasonable estimate.  If you do hit a good number of good ones, consider offering more if you think the collection hasn't been thoroughly gone over for gems.    Its a game of convincing him that he will:  1) have to look for someone who doesn't know how to estimate the value of a collection to get more and   2) they will get less from a store  all the while you keep the price low enough that you think you can still find enough value to make it worth your while.  If it honestly isn't worth your while at a price he wants, tell him so, then leave.  Don't keep playing if it isn't worth it."
mtgmarketwatch,2qz5od,the-axis,1 point,Thu Jan 1 03:33:52 2015 UTC,Push for at least a couple of quick photos.  Maybe he's got some stuff that can justify an offer closer to his asking price.
mtgmarketwatch,2qz5od,Theangryhermit,1 point,Thu Jan 1 11:05:42 2015 UTC,"I don't think he'll take it (in my five years of experience buying collections on craigslist) but if you can get him to pay the bulk prices your asking, it seems like a fine buy.   I generally never buy collections in the blind - I get enough information to make a EV calculation that making the drive is worth it and go check it out in person.   I have definitely drove more than an hour only to turn around empty handed, its part of the job."
mtgmarketwatch,2qz5od,SaffronOlive,1 point,Thu Jan 1 15:54:47 2015 UTC,"I'm really surprised by the low ball estimates I'm seeing. Either people find some suckers willing to take lowball offers, or they simply don't buy that many collections.   I've probably purchases a dozen collections over the past year, ranging from 200 to 9k cards.   Bulk rates are 5-7 per thousand assorted commons uncommons. Rares are 10-12c a piece. If you can get a collection for those rates, it is an absolute snap buy every time.   However, if you do know what's in the collection, even partially, you can raise your offer and still easily profit. Every playset of vampire nighthawk, delver of secrets or gitixian probe is money in the bank. It actually benefits the seller to provide you a list of the ""best"" cards in the collection. You feel more confident making an offer, and the seller is happy to get a higher offer.   If you have a list of a collections rares, simply throw the list into tappedout as a ""deck"" and see the tcg low/mid/high for a quick estimate. I like to offer 50-60% of tcg mid, just based off rares, hoping to get the other commons/uncommons thrown in.   Also, don't scoff at bulk. I sell bulk 500 card lots all day on ebay for an average of 15 bucks each, containing 30 rares, 75 uncommons and 400 commons. With that in mind, I can profit even greater if I nab a collection at ""bulk"" rates."
mtgmarketwatch,2qz5od,WigginIII,0,Fri Jan 2 10:37:35 2015 UTC,"Right now, maybe fifty bucks.   This 'guy' needs to put more effort in if he wants a better selling price, like actually going through his cards and pulling out the good stuff. Saying 7,000 cards means very little. Most Magic players can point to 7,000 cards that are effectively worthless.  If 7,000 is the only info he can be bothered to give you, offer him a bulk price based on that. $50 might actually be a bit generous."
mtgmarketwatch,2qz5od,davekayaus,3,Thu Jan 1 07:11:30 2015 UTC,"I would pay $50 for the rares alone, site unseen. You are going way, way too low, to the point of being insulting, which is a very risky business model."
mtgmarketwatch,2qz5od,SaffronOlive,3,Thu Jan 1 15:56:37 2015 UTC,"$50 is the absolute minimum you would pay for 500 rares, so it is actually an insulting offer."
mtgmarketwatch,2qz5od,Chosler88,-4,Thu Jan 1 18:59:49 2015 UTC,"Unsorted I'd offer $.1 per thousand commons and uncommons, and ask about taking a look at the rares and foils before making an offer."
mtgmarketwatch,2qypwx,Encendi,15,Wed Dec 31 23:35:25 2014 UTC,"Part of it is likely due to so much value being buried in the fetchlands right now, like you said. Also, this standard is very diverse so it's not like when you had to have Sphinx's Rev to play control. Now you have different options for aggro, different options for midrange, different options control and combo as an option."
mtgmarketwatch,2qypwx,mtd14,3,Wed Dec 31 23:39:55 2014 UTC,"Yep, the fall in value isn't a KTK-only thing and can't be attributed to fetches. What really seems to be happening is that a diverse of fluid meta is keeping the prices of chase rares down - there's no equivalent to Mutavault in the current standard."
mtgmarketwatch,2qypwx,mtg_liebestod,2,Thu Jan 1 07:09:36 2015 UTC,"That's a very good point. However, I still think there are a lot of shared staples between decks, not to mention Eternal viability with stuff like Siege Rhino."
mtgmarketwatch,2qypwx,Rock-swarm,2,Wed Dec 31 23:49:28 2014 UTC,"Keep in mind the fact that staples like rhino and sidisi will still have high demand next year. Pair this with the fact that no new KTK packs will have been drafted for about 6 months at that point, and you have some decent mid-term spec targets.  Personally, I've been hoarding up Rhino, swiftspear, and fetch foils, as those are the safest spec targets even going into long-term."
mtgmarketwatch,2qypwx,anubis647,2,Thu Jan 1 02:58:39 2015 UTC,"I'm hesitant about foil fetches, just because I'm biased since I remember when foil shocks were <$20 (even blue) and I just can't justify $70 for  foils that are even more common than them.  I'm on board with Rhino. I've yet to see a modern competitive foil rare command <$20 and Siege Rhino is played in two of the best Modern decks at the moment. I'm somewhat hesitant on Swiftspear, partially because I'm bitter about missing the boat (I was thinking about picking up a foil set when she was spoiled) and also because I just can't justify its price when Delver is still $15."
mtgmarketwatch,2qypwx,Spider-Plant,1 point,Thu Jan 1 03:44:57 2015 UTC,"I agree with the fetchlands point. I have seen several people comment how the fetches haven't gone down as far as they had expected, so I think a lot of the value of the set is in the fetchalnds."
mtgmarketwatch,2qypwx,swskeptic,1 point,Thu Jan 1 00:04:22 2015 UTC,"I would wait a little for the fetchlands, considering people will be opening them in FRF packs as well. The supply side is going to keep rising since two sets in print have the same fetches in them."
mtgmarketwatch,2qypwx,drakeblood4,1 point,Fri Jan 2 13:21:11 2015 UTC,"Not to mention the fact that print runs are no doubt increasing with every set, increasing supply. That and basically everyone and their mother is cracking packs trying to get fetches. That at least accounts for the KTK prices I would think."
mtgmarketwatch,2qypwx,crminshaw,5,Thu Jan 1 02:13:00 2015 UTC,"I suspect that price memory is the only thing holding them up. I think that buyers have distorted price perception, and thus a trigger price. Combined with the fact that there aren't enough sellers, they fail to create the significant downward trend fetches should be seeing.   For example, I have a trigger on foil Siege Rhinos that go below $12 shipped, because I think they're worth $12 at the moment. I've only picked up one in the past week and I've been checking nearly every day. You see, I'm kind of like a barrier to foil Siege Rhinos dropping below $12. And surprisingly enough, it seems that I alone am enough to hold back any sellers who try to undercut others.  If a lot of players who think fetches should be expensive have triggers set at $10-15, then we'll never see them drop much, because ultimately there aren't enough people undercutting each other to force the trigger buyers to give up.   Anyways, my point is, buyers influence the price as much as sellers, which is kind of interesting to note since they have no presence on TCGplayer. In addition, I believe the buyers in this case are wrong about the prices they're calling, but it remains to be seen whether price memory will hold or be broken down by sheer supply.   Edit: This is why buylists create a ""soft"" price. Imagine if there were enough Revised duals for everyone on earth who wants to play Legacy to have a playset. Well, then they'd be nearly worthless, right? But two issues exist: one, only a small number of them are on the market, and two, stores have buylists set at $100 (random number). Thus, even if people wanted to list the cards on the market, the prices would never come close to $100, just because sellers want to do better than buylist. Conversely, if there's a spike in supply (a bunch more sellers list the cards and crash the price), buylists need to be lowered, as sellers start selling to buylists, although I think this is a much rare case and is likely correlated to some meta shift. My point is, a lot of the time Magic prices are dictated irrespective of actual supply and demand in the market. In my opinion, almost all Magic prices are distorted."
mtgmarketwatch,2qypwx,Chosler88,0,Thu Jan 1 03:57:18 2015 UTC,"The lack of a dominant color or color pair is also very relevant. Goblin Rabblemaster and Stoke the Flames are mandatory in red decks right now, but red isn't dominant enough for that to be a problem. Sameish thing for Thoughtseize in black, delve draw in blue, and courser caryatid in green, but there are decks running all colors. White for some reason is only mandatory in 3 color cards, I dunno why."
mtgmarketwatch,2qypwx,b_fellow,6,Thu Jan 1 05:30:17 2015 UTC,"Also, like you mentioned, khans and theros have been heavily opened. Lots of supply and (relatively) lower demand due to the diversity of decks in standard now. Prices seem to be lower as well currently due to a new set just around the corner, which could lead to new archetypes and even more decks. People just don't want to invest $150 for a playset of staples anymore, due to how fast the meta is changing."
mtgmarketwatch,2qye2k,Listrain,6,Wed Dec 31 21:35:36 2014 UTC,"Look at the Onslaught fetches for comparison. They tanked the moment the KTK fetches were announced. ZEN fetches will do the same whenever they're printed, which could be a long way off or really soon. KTK fetches proved that any set with fetches will be opened as much as possible, so whether its in a Standard set or MMA2 expect a big price drop. ZEN foils should hold though, for what its worth."
mtgmarketwatch,2qye2k,kahluahandcream,2,Wed Dec 31 21:53:57 2014 UTC,Probably reprint in the next fall set and filter lands in MMA2.

There's not much worry about getting Bloodmoon'd in the current meta."
mtgmarketwatch,2qye2k,khaaansolo,2,Wed Dec 31 23:14:46 2014 UTC,"So if they are printed in MMA2, like you said probably not too much impact on price. My guess is DTK would cut them down to about ~$30 for each of them comparing to Lorwyn Thoughtseize for that estimate. So my logic on these is to guess what value you think you would be losing through buying now. They'll likely show up in MMA2 or DTK, let's assume 30/70 split for which it'll show up. DTK you lose ~$15 each, and MMA2 you lose ~$10 each, so your estimated value lost is $15.7+$10.3 or $13.50 each.  Lots of estimating there and you can adjust the values as you see fit. Once you have an estimated value lost per card, ask yourself ""Would I be willing to rent these cards for now through May for this much?"" So if you wanted 4 Tarns and 4 Mistys, you're asking ""Would I be willing to rent these cards for $100 to play Modern from now through May?"" If yes, go ahead and buy. If not, wait but be ready to re-evaluate if they don't show up in DTK because that means the values change."
mtgmarketwatch,2qye2k,mtd14,1 point,Wed Dec 31 21:49:54 2014 UTC,"From a purely financial perspective, they're due for a reprint and thus headed downhill. Tarn and Misty were up around $75 and $70 until the new fetches were announced; they've been on a slow slide since then.   My conjecture is that a reprint between now and October puts them at $30 if they're in MM2 and $20 if in Dragons. That said, I like the chances they have now as pickups and am getting into them. It wouldn't be surprising to me if they are reprinted after (maybe even way after) Khans rotates, instead of right away. Those two in particular are in good shape because they're in well-established decks and will lose less value from a reprint than some of the Onslaught ones (here's looking at you, Bloodstained Mire...)  Personally, I'm holding mine. As an avid EDH player, the intangible value of getting to play with them is worth more to me than the money I'd be able to get from them. Since you're looking to build a deck and invest, you'll need to make that decision yourself."
mtgmarketwatch,2qye2k,ScienceWil,0,Wed Dec 31 22:46:10 2014 UTC,they wont be reprinted in standard till after current fetchs leave rotation and thats the soonest we will see them.

mtgmarketwatch,2qy0vt,crminshaw,2,Wed Dec 31 19:53:03 2014 UTC,"If you absolutely must have the cards as soon as possible for a deck/tournament (i.e. release weekend), I'd suggest a LGS that cracks cases for singles.  They should have the cards available for you to pickup that Friday, and prices will be high everywhere.  If you order online, you won't have them in time for release weekend.  If you can wait though, just about everything will go down.  Pay attention to twitter and good magic finance sites around the time of the pro-tour, and watch SCG coverage opening weekend, and then you can jump on cards that have the potential to move.  But even then, you need to be ready and have a plan to unload quickly if you don't plan on using the cards.  Mantis Rider went to $8-10 shortly after release, and is now a $1.50 card.  And it's a good card!  Most everything will follow that pattern."
mtgmarketwatch,2qy0vt,minutehourday,-2,Wed Dec 31 19:59:57 2014 UTC,"I'm really just pre-ordering because I want to get some cards before they could go up higher in value and I might have to spend more on them.   For example, I'd like to get a copy of Soulfire Grand Master before release if I feel it's going to actually increase in value. Basically, I only really want to pre-order things if I think I can get them cheaper now than after release."
mtgmarketwatch,2qy0vt,jesusice,9,Wed Dec 31 20:24:22 2014 UTC,"They won't. To reiterate what's already said, the prices will go down. Just think of simple supply and demand principles."
mtgmarketwatch,2qy0vt,Ottimo-Massimo,2,Wed Dec 31 22:38:57 2014 UTC,"preorder is the absolute worst time / mode to buy singles: because 99% you are buying singles at their top price in the entire card's lifespan. You are deceived by the 1% that is underpriced in preorder! Unless you are the only genius able to foresee which cards are that 1%, of course.  Just look at price graph of all cards in their first 2-4 weeks of life: it goes down, always."
mtgmarketwatch,2qy0vt,the-axis,3,Thu Jan 1 13:47:53 2015 UTC,"I just always assume pre order prices are 3 times their actual value.  90%of cards are going to drop within a month after release.  You need incredible luck to pick out which cards are going to go up after release. If people knew which cards would go up or down, they would hold the under priced ones and sell the over priced ones.   As for pre sales, they sell x at a price. If they sell x quickly, they raise the price and sell more. If people keep paying their presale price they keep going up. If noone bites at the hyped up presale price they eventually go down post release."
mtgmarketwatch,2qy0vt,Fluxxed0,1 point,Thu Jan 1 06:04:48 2015 UTC,"I typically only pre-order bulk rares that I'm speculating on... the junkers that I think might find casual or EDH success and rise to a couple bucks.  I like Card Kingdom for that, because they list their baseline rares at 50 cents instead of a bulk like most other sites.  I was able to net a little money off cards like Hornet Nest and Genesis Hydra by pre-ordering them low.  I categorically stay away from mythics, Planeswalkers, chase rares, lands, and hype cards.  All of those will fall in price."
mtgmarketwatch,2qy0vt,crminshaw,1 point,Wed Dec 31 21:24:38 2014 UTC,I typically only pre-order bulk rares that I'm speculating on...   That's what I'm doing at the moment. I'm speculating that some of the enchantments and Archfiend of Depravity will see increases in price.
mtgmarketwatch,2qy0vt,stieveb,1 point,Wed Dec 31 21:28:21 2014 UTC,"I like the spec on archfiend. He can probably see play in most black decks, especially as hate against whip decks or token decks, which tend to flood the board. However he is an intro pack rare, so there will be a lot of supply of him, which could hinder large spikes."
mtgmarketwatch,2qy0vt,WigginIII,1 point,Wed Dec 31 23:36:24 2014 UTC,"I think his price could be impacted because of being in the intro pack, but like Sylvan Caryatid if he sees enough play, I'm still seeing some good profit off him.  If I buy him at the current price of anywhere from $.50 to $1.00 and he reaches Caryatid's current price of 8-ish, I'm doing quite well."
mtgmarketwatch,2qy0vt,mtd14,1 point,Wed Dec 31 23:58:23 2014 UTC,"don't forget fetches are here to, this will also be opened just for them... and as such the price will even go deeper down...."
mtgmarketwatch,2qxyik,shammikaze,8,Wed Dec 31 19:10:25 2014 UTC,"I don't know, all the reasons you list relate to her being a 3 mana 4 power creature. We have plenty of those, and there are just better options (Knuckleblades, Anafenza, Boon Satyr) if that's all you're after. Unless you're really using the activated ability, it's just Alpine Grizzly with Trample. I'd expect it to fall to bulk."
mtgmarketwatch,2qxyik,mtd14,2,Wed Dec 31 19:33:38 2014 UTC,"Good call on Boon Satyr, not sure how I managed to forget him."
mtgmarketwatch,2qxyik,minutehourday,4,Wed Dec 31 19:43:33 2014 UTC,"She feels like she's at the power level of Exava - not weak, but far from overpowering.  Turning on ferocious is nice, and she seems cool as a potential commander, but she seems worse than other options in her colors - especially courser, rabblemaster, and knuckleblade.  I'm not even sure if she's better than fanatic of xenagos.  Color me surprised if she's worth more than $2 while she's in print."
mtgmarketwatch,2qxyik,drakeblood4,0,Wed Dec 31 19:44:42 2014 UTC,She feels like a rare/mythic borderline rare that was made mythic for story reasons.
mtgmarketwatch,2qxyik,oouncolaoo,2,Thu Jan 1 05:57:09 2015 UTC,She is not mythic.
mtgmarketwatch,2qxyik,drakeblood4,1 point,Thu Jan 1 23:31:27 2015 UTC,I keep forgetting these khans aren't mythic.
mtgmarketwatch,2qxyik,kahluahandcream,1 point,Thu Jan 1 23:36:04 2015 UTC,"At $1 each, its not a bad gamble considering a playset will be the price of a booster pack. I really don't see this as anything special though - cards like Courser, Rabblemaster and Savage Knux are such better candidates in the three drop spot. While the early ferocious and her ability are tempting, I think she's much more likely to wind up on the bulk side of the fence."
mtgmarketwatch,2qxyik,GrossoGGO,1 point,Wed Dec 31 20:22:33 2014 UTC,I'm not a fan of pre-ordering specs. I tried it once during RTR and got very lucky (with Trostani). I tried it again later and ended up wasting money. My personal opinion is that buying a playset for $1 each is decent if you want them to play with. I would advise against ordering many as a spec - you don't loose money you don't spend.
mtgmarketwatch,2qxyik,Tehdougler,1 point,Wed Dec 31 21:28:34 2014 UTC,"I can see her going up at first due to hype, but honestly I would rather play a Fanatic of Xenagos or Boon Satyr at EoT than her."
mtgmarketwatch,2qxyik,davekayaus,1 point,Wed Dec 31 22:48:19 2014 UTC,"I don't see any potential in this card. Maybe the foil, since at least in Commander she's easy to cast while still giving your deck access to three colours. But then green hardly has issues generating non-green mana, and I wouldn't pick her over Animar or Maelstrom Wanderer.  Maybe if you proxy up and playtest rather than doing a magicalchristmasland thought experiment, you'd get a better impression."
mtgmarketwatch,2qxyik,Hammunition,1 point,Thu Jan 1 00:32:35 2015 UTC,It could pretty easily be in an intro deck. I'd at least wait till those are announced.
mtgmarketwatch,2qxyik,crminshaw,0,Thu Jan 1 10:59:53 2015 UTC,"I like picking a playset or two at this price. Can't really drop in price, and can only go up. It's legendary so also has a little commander potential. Has the potential to be $5+ depending on how standard goes over the next year"
mtgmarketwatch,2qxyik,TiredTofu,6,Wed Dec 31 19:13:11 2014 UTC,"$5? Are you serious? She's not a good card.   Sidisi's a $5 card, and that's a mythic with an entire ARCHETYPE around her plus being a desirable card in commander.  Yasova's a Boon Satyr without flash or bestow in exchange for a situational Threaten effect that hits small creatures. And she's a only rare (with little to no commander/casual appeal).   This is a bust of a spec. Even if it triples in price, you won't be offloading these quickly since people won't want playsets of them, and after you calculate in fees, you won't be making nearly any money for your time.  Just because this sub has little doesn't have much moderation doesn't mean we should just make bold claims and guesses that mean nothing. Feel free to back up your claims with evidence/comparisons if you think I've misanalyzed this."
mtgmarketwatch,2qxyik,drakeblood4,1 point,Wed Dec 31 19:32:20 2014 UTC,Sidisi's a $5 card while KTK is being drafted and people are still playing the fetchland lottery. If reanimator or delve decks are still around after Theros rotates (read: probably) she won't be a $5 card.
mtgmarketwatch,2qxyik,TiredTofu,2,Thu Jan 1 05:58:08 2015 UTC,"I didn't say that Sidisi would be a $5 card forever. I was using her current price and her current playability to make a point. My point is that Sidisi (a card that has all of the hallmarks of being a value card) is extremely underpriced right now.  I used that point to illustrate that Yasova would never hit that level of playability, and therefore, that price.  I actually agree with you. Sidisi is criminally underpriced, and I think she's a great pickup for Theros rotation. She could even see a price spike along the lines of Blood Baron if things line up right."
mtgmarketwatch,2qxyik,drakeblood4,2,Thu Jan 1 06:23:01 2015 UTC,"She'll never see Blood Baron levels, there's just too much supply. Think more like Sorin, Lord of Innistrad before the Duel Deck announcement."
mtgmarketwatch,2qxyik,TiredTofu,1 point,Thu Jan 1 06:34:33 2015 UTC,"Eh, both Blood Baron and Sorin, LoI ended up in the ~$20 zone. I'd be surprised if she quadrupled in value, but even with the number of Khans packs opened, I'd say that it's safe to say that she'll be somewhere between $10-$15 at some point during her tenure in Standard."
mtgmarketwatch,2qxyik,crminshaw,1 point,Thu Jan 1 06:39:12 2015 UTC,"I just think this has potential, and at $1 preorder it's worth the risk.   In my opinion, I think that it could see play in standard easily. Triggers ferocious, steals coursers, rabblemasters, mantis rider etc.   Okay maybe $5 was a little optimistic, but in the right deck it could shine by using the sweet new bolster mechanic?? Or just going in a temur aggro/midrange deck?"
mtgmarketwatch,2qxyik,crminshaw,2,Wed Dec 31 19:44:42 2014 UTC,"Well, the deck I'm making is gonna be a sort of troll deck.  http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/30-12-14-hungry-hungry-hydras/"
mtgmarketwatch,2qxyik,Lalagah,2,Wed Dec 31 19:56:05 2014 UTC,^ See this is what I mean by potential! Great deck btw
mtgmarketwatch,2qwx7z,SaffronOlive,7,Wed Dec 31 12:17:26 2014 UTC,It makes lightning bolt lightning helix.  It makes boros charm warleaders helix.  It makes lightning helix lightning helixir of immortality.  Pyroclasm becomes pyrocongregate.  BLASPHEMOUS ACT becomes drunk.
mtgmarketwatch,2qwx7z,Grasswalker,2,Wed Dec 31 15:15:13 2014 UTC,Best description ever.
mtgmarketwatch,2qwx7z,Chosler88,2,Wed Dec 31 21:02:45 2014 UTC,quick to cast.  Slow in a fast paced game
mtgmarketwatch,2qwx7z,mikesgordon,2,Wed Dec 31 13:40:57 2014 UTC,"True, but it's also one of a very small number of cards that comes down early and is still (and least potentially) the best card on the board on turns 6-8."
mtgmarketwatch,2qwx7z,mikesgordon,1 point,Wed Dec 31 13:48:18 2014 UTC,definitely would be beast in later turns....if it is able to stay on the board until then.  Otherwise it's giving a buff to your life total and hitting the graveyard.  It will be a target the moment it hits the battlefield.  That doesn't negate the power of the card obviously.
mtgmarketwatch,2qwx7z,freekleenex,2,Wed Dec 31 14:05:01 2014 UTC,To me it seems like the exact card you would want in a fast paced game as the life gain becomes much more relevant in a race condition. I think this card will really hurt removal light aggro strategies like U/W heroic and mono red sligh if put into the Jeskai tokens deck as a straight swap for Seeker of the Way. But of course there's still plenty of spoilers to see so who knows!
mtgmarketwatch,2qwx7z,Snow_Regalia,2,Wed Dec 31 15:51:58 2014 UTC,"Card is powerful both early and late in the game, has an acceptable body with an easy casting cost, and is a powerhouse without constraining your deck during construction. I'm sold on it and will be snapping up as many as I can in the $10-12 range."
mtgmarketwatch,2qwx7z,MerryChoppins,1 point,Wed Dec 31 14:46:38 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I mentioned that in the article. If Grand Master misses out an heavy play immediately and drops to the $10 range, it becomes very attractive."
mtgmarketwatch,2qwx7z,RubiksMaster614,1 point,Wed Dec 31 15:26:24 2014 UTC,"I disagree somewhat with your conclusion from the article.  I think it will follow the exact same sort of price curve that Lotus Cobra did, he will stay high and stable until he leaves standard then ? based on what modern does with him. Voice at several points was just kinda not powerful enough for the meta. He jumped around a lot in price (though within a reasonable corridor) because at various points he just wasn't seeing as much play. I think that if Grand Master catches on (likely), it will do what Lotus Cobra did and just find it's home in the meta and stay stable.   Brimaz is the most recent thing I can think of that is comparable in power level and usefulness and he's been very stable in pricing (though he has been trending up or down the whole time). There's not as much room to take advantage of price shocks like there was with voice."
mtgmarketwatch,2qwx7z,kahluahandcream,2,Wed Dec 31 18:00:32 2014 UTC,I disagree with his reasoning that FR will be opened more. We saw the exact same situation in Dragons Maze (replacing the basic land with potentially a very valuable land) yet it was still under opened. I fully expect it to hit voice prizes and possibly higher depending on how much play it sees in legacy
mtgmarketwatch,2qwx7z,GHChinMTG,3,Wed Dec 31 18:39:11 2014 UTC,"I think your missing the fact that FRF will be opened for twice as long as DGM, plus DGM was overshadowed by MMA due to its release date, which will not happen (as least as much) with FRF."
mtgmarketwatch,2qwx7z,fyawm,1 point,Wed Dec 31 19:23:48 2014 UTC,"At the very least, Soulfire will be a small set mythic that is a completely unique card with a lot of casual appeal. At the very most, it becomes a powerhouse across multiple formats once the pros start building with it. I picked up a playset at $15 each for my own use, and I'd be shocked if I wind up regretting it. Will be looking for a low period to buy more into these in the long run based on how they perform post release."
mtgmarketwatch,2qwx7z,ardeay,1 point,Wed Dec 31 15:40:26 2014 UTC,"Good comparison with historical printing of mythics at 3 cmc and under. While I am convinced that the Grand Master's merit from being highly versatile, I am concerned about her lack of ETB value and fragility. Voice of Resurgence guarantees value once you resolve it (unless it gets Pillared) and Thassa is pretty damn hard to remove.   Then again she only costs 2 to cast. You're not losing much in tempo if she gets Bolted, I meant Striked upon hitting the board."
mtgmarketwatch,2qwx7z,worldchrisis,1 point,Wed Dec 31 16:06:12 2014 UTC,There's no question in my mind that she's Modern playable if Jeskai Ascendancy isn't banned. Including an infinite combo in an otherwise Burn/Tempo deck is hard to beat.
mtgmarketwatch,2qx2w3,TheRecovery,3,Wed Dec 31 13:51:27 2014 UTC,"Tags like [meta], [discussion] etc are good ideas."
mtgmarketwatch,2qx2w3,Chosler88,8,Wed Dec 31 17:57:48 2014 UTC,"I'd really like a subreddit for financial discussion rather than another place for blog writers to crosspost their articles.  With that in mind, I have a suggestion.  Self-posts only.  Links to articles should be permitted only with context.  If you find a finance article that you think is interesting, link it in a self-post and write a short explanation of why it's interesting and what kinds of discussion you want to generate.  However, there's no value in having another subreddit full of QS and BSB links."
mtgmarketwatch,2qx2w3,Fluxxed0,7,Wed Dec 31 14:53:06 2014 UTC,"I hated that the old sub became nothing but article links. I had to continue posting mine because, well, traffic is traffic, but it felt bad. I love posting into an active board where maybe a few articles are posted alongside other posts as part of the community, rather than it feeling like preaching to the community.   Obviously I Have a stake, but I think* that given the greater number of posts we'll see here the problem will correct itself."
mtgmarketwatch,2qx2w3,Chosler88,5,Wed Dec 31 17:55:50 2014 UTC,"I do read your articles and like them a lot.  I kinda wish you didn't cross-post quite as much as you do, but I get why you do it.  The mtgfinance subreddit is a sad story.  The moderators spent a long time fighting off accusations that they were sockpuppets for Quiet Speculation, and I actually believed them for a while.  Then I dunno what happened, but they proved everybody right by clamping down on individual participating and turning the sub over to the bloggers.  I'm hoping for a subreddit where we can have some discussion free of the shadow of subscription finance sites.  I think it's great for a user to link an article (like the one on Soulfire Grand Master) and provide commentary on it.  I just don't want that to turn into ""Here's a link to the article I wrote this week, check it out!"" if you know what I mean."
mtgmarketwatch,2qx2w3,Fluxxed0,5,Wed Dec 31 20:33:18 2014 UTC,"That makes sense. Is the difference for you that there's something accompanying the post on Reddit like a comment, or initiating a starting point for the conversation or what? I would love to tailor my approach to something people like.  I understand why subscription sites like QS can seem like a shadow. After all, you know all along their goal is to sign you up, so I understand why people are leery of it. That said, the poor decisions made by the mods in the last sub were all their own. No one from any of the subscription sites (QS, MTGPrice, Puca, etc) ever had contact with them about the decisions they made for the sub.   I think we can all agree that the old rules were far too restrictive and killed the forum, but I would also like to not misplace the responsibility for that."
mtgmarketwatch,2qx2w3,Chosler88,1 point,Wed Dec 31 21:01:53 2014 UTC,"I'm interested seeing some wider discussion around a card or a set.  When you read blogs, you're getting one person's opinion on a card.  That's useful.  Then you go on #mtgfinance on Twitter, and you see lots of different data points presented in a fairly disorganized fashion.  That's useful too, in its own way.  But what I'm looking for is a forum for open discussion.  The Magic and Reddit communities are a bit of an echo chamber... always have been.  When a popular finance writer directly links to an article he wrote, the tendency is for people to simply agree because they recognize the name on the post.  But when some random reddit user links to a blog and says ""This is an interesting article, though I disagree on the following points..."" we can have an actual conversation where people get engaged.  Does that make any sense at all?  One of the ways I've had success in MTG finance is cutting THROUGH the echo chamber and forming opinions on cards that may or may not be in line with what finance blogs are saying that week.  The relatively new Facebook group has been really helpful for that (welcome, by the way).  I'm hoping this subreddit can also be helpful."
mtgmarketwatch,2qx2w3,Fluxxed0,2,Wed Dec 31 21:20:22 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I agree on basically all your points. One of the things I try to do is never block someone for disagreeing with me, no matter how rude they are about it. I've blocked exactly one person ever in five years on Twitter, and it was over something different. Listening to people who disagree with you is just as important than listening to those who already agree.  After all, we were all random reddit users at one point. I got my start by speaking up and disagreeing with Medina on Venser, the Sojourner when Scars of Mirrodin came out, and he engaged with me then and gave me a chance (and made a bet on its future price that I won, lol). I try to extend the same courtesy to everyone."
mtgmarketwatch,2qx2w3,Chosler88,1 point,Wed Dec 31 23:04:55 2014 UTC,I appreciate your openness Corbin. Your probably the only writer I read regularly. What are your thoughts of using something like a submission statement like on r/truereddit ?
mtgmarketwatch,2qx2w3,ishlyn,4,Thu Jan 1 02:33:13 2015 UTC,"I disagree.  If this place has all the articles (which aren't many per day) and community posts then that's what I want in one place.  Everyone keeps thinking they know better than everyone else and trying to ""protect"" the children. The old sub trying to circumvent how reddit works was wrong, no need to do it here just to get ""revenge""."
mtgmarketwatch,2qx2w3,Theangryhermit,3,Thu Jan 1 01:14:25 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Blog writers are people writing about finance just like people posting in a reddit mtg finance sub. Do you really care if I formulate some words on my wordpress blog and then link it here, or just type up my thoughts here? What is the difference? My words and thoughts are my words and thoughts no matter which website they originated from, right?  Many of the writers of these blogs, like Jason E Alt (finances favorite asshole) and Shut up Corbin Hostler post often. It isn't like they pump and dump articles all day. They engage. They debate and defend their ideas with people on reddit. Let them post their articles and then see if it leads to some good discussion.  The problem with MTG finance isn't that blog posts were allowed, it was that they ended up being almost the only thing allowed."
mtgmarketwatch,2qx2w3,jassi007,1 point,Wed Dec 31 20:35:08 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I think it does matter.  If you want to read Corbin's blog, go read his blog.  If you have a blog of your own and you want to whore it for pageviews, then /r/mtgfinance is a great place for you to do that.  But I think we would benefit from having a subreddit free of that content.  If /r/mtgmarketwatch turns into just another mouthpiece for Jason Alt's article spam, then I'll stop subscribing same as I did with /r/mtgfinance."
mtgmarketwatch,2qx2w3,Fluxxed0,2,Wed Dec 31 21:06:38 2014 UTC,Disagree. What we need is a subreddit where some actual discussion can take place. I think individual threads and blog links are part of a healthy mix.
mtgmarketwatch,2qx2w3,davekayaus,2,Thu Jan 1 01:53:11 2015 UTC,Well I disagree! I think a finance sub should have both article and user submissions
mtgmarketwatch,2qx2w3,jassi007,1 point,Wed Dec 31 21:30:18 2014 UTC,"I certainly agree with you on this one. Articles are generally just a very very well thought out version of a user submission with prettier formatting, pictures, and other niceties."
mtgmarketwatch,2qx2w3,mtd14,1 point,Thu Jan 1 21:23:21 2015 UTC,"The self-posts only is an interesting idea, but I don't think I'll adopt it just yet. And I'll tell you exactly what my logic is so you can point out flaws in it:  First and foremost sites like Brainstorm Brewery, MTGGoldfish, MTGPrice, etc are all important resources for the finance community. They all have articles that I have learned from, but some even offer useful tools. I believe we are responsible for keeping them going, not just to help people behind the sites but to keep these resource available for our use.   I wanted to make that point so you understand the area I'm coming from. I think we don't need to force self posts because authors are posting what their article is about in the title. For example, look at /u/SaffronOlive's article on our page titled ""Just How Good is Soulfire Grand Master?"". You can guess what it is going to be about based on that title. Now, we could require him to write a summary of his article in a self-post, then put a link at the bottom directing us to the article. The problem is that many will just read the summary, which defeats the point of a well written, formatted, and thought out post. It also takes away from the pageviews that I would say he deserves for the article.   However, if we see the quality of articles going down that would certainly warrant reconsidering the situation. Also, I think having more posts per day will greatly dilute the % of articles so it won't feel like these articles are being pushed on us."
mtgmarketwatch,2qx2w3,mtd14,0,Thu Jan 1 21:21:06 2015 UTC,Agree.   reference the article..even link to it but have a meaningful discussion going on in the comments.
mtgmarketwatch,2qx2w3,mikesgordon,2,Wed Dec 31 15:50:35 2014 UTC,"I think /r/mtgfinance has a lot of issues due to a few components: timeliness, context, and reddit itself.  Timeliness -  A lot of content like ""SPIKE"" threads are bad content because once it's posted, there usually aren't opportunities to profit.  Good spec topics are generally long term gainers, and outside of that it's either deep analysis or pure luck that a cheap card was on stream and in half of the decks at that Pro Tour event.  Hence, the spike notification is expired information.  Context - Finance specs have context within shifting metagames of each format, and each format reacts differently to these shifts.  I won't go into the specifics of that here, but a ""SPIKE"" in a modern sideboard card often has no effect in legacy.  reddit - I don't know that reddit is a great format for speculation.  Generic forum threads can be brought back after years of inactivity, and historical information is retained.  On reddit, if you have more than 10 posts per day, threads older than 3 days are likely to never be on the front page ever again.  Having said that, we might just have to deal with reposts about certain cards every week or so.  Combining all of these, if a thread is about a particular card spec, I think it should be meta tagged with which format you're talking about [Modern], [Standard], [EDH], etc.  ""SPIKE"" threads should be avoided, but ""You missed the boat on this card, here's why"" might be okay if they give more contextual information on the event itself, and how the card fit into the decks in which it was played.  Finally, people are either going to have to learn to use the search function, or we have to accept reposts about volatile cards.  tl;dr: We need to be a hybrid of /r/spikes and /r/mtgfinance where we actually discuss why cards are good, and what their values should be based on different contexts."
mtgmarketwatch,2qx2w3,Lollipopsaurus,2,Wed Dec 31 15:59:16 2014 UTC,I'm going to say that I actually disagree on SPIKE threads. I see them as local trade and buying arbitrage opportunities more than as encouragement to be a greater fool online.
mtgmarketwatch,2qx2w3,drakeblood4,1 point,Thu Jan 1 06:02:10 2015 UTC,I think putting everything in the AMA weekly thread was another huge mistake on the other sub reddit.  It made it hard to quickly look for things that interest you. There was still some interesting discussion taking place but it was hidden in that thread and took a lot of effort to find. I am sure I missed out on interesting stuff.  This site looks more interesting already and it's only a few days old.
mtgmarketwatch,2qx89o,GHChinMTG,2,Wed Dec 31 14:59:16 2014 UTC,"Good article, enjoyed the read!"
mtgmarketwatch,2qx89o,Chosler88,1 point,Wed Dec 31 19:08:10 2014 UTC,Thanks Corbin!
mtgmarketwatch,2qxg0o,HARRRR,1 point,Wed Dec 31 16:19:52 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the reply! I will most likely not be playing with them, although a couple of others in my playgroup are after a few.  I didn't know about cards picking up in Feb. Have just seen the promo for that month is disdainful stroke, so may hold onto them until around then when I will be able to trade them for those...which would definitely see play"
mtgmarketwatch,2qxg0o,kahluahandcream,2,Wed Dec 31 16:26:26 2014 UTC,"It's a surefire staple until rotation where it will drop after. For frame of reference, Banishing Light was a recent FNM promo of another massive Standard staple and the promos of that have rounded out to $3.50 when they were trading around the $8-9 range during the month they were distributed. The Stokes could fall alongside the M15 Stokes as well if the promos wind up just being another way to get a currently hard to find uncommon. The price on both could hold around and the Promo will remain $8, but I think its more likely that in the months to come supply will meet demand and the potential of Stoke in M16 will lead to the price tanking on both."
mtgmarketwatch,2qxg0o,Hammunition,1 point,Wed Dec 31 16:31:44 2014 UTC,Stoke is much more highly played than Banishing Light. And having convoke means there's a very low chance of it being in M16.
mtgmarketwatch,2qx73c,ProtoJMan,8,Wed Dec 31 14:45:21 2014 UTC,I doubt fetchlands will be reprinted in MMA2 given their recent appearance in Khans. The Zen fetches will probably be printed in the third Khan's set. I am hopeful for a fastland reprint along with Hierarch.
mtgmarketwatch,2qx73c,Stazman93,2,Wed Dec 31 16:15:38 2014 UTC,"Fastland would make sense with sets from 3+ years ago being a focus, but I don't think they need a reprint that badly.  And as much as I'd like to say the other fetches would be reprinted in Dragons of Tarkir I just don't see them doing that. No real need for standard.   I wonder if next block we'll see non-basic lands with the basic types? Something to play nicely with the fetches, or if the fetchlands are good enough on their own in standard."
mtgmarketwatch,2qx73c,Smotchkkiss,1 point,Wed Dec 31 16:23:51 2014 UTC,"I don't think they will because the dragons tribes seem to have 2 colors that match the KTK fetches. So printing Zen fetches in Dragons of Tarkir just doesn't make sense anymore.  However the story and some card art is hinting strongly at a return to Zendikar, so I personally now think they will be printed either in MMA2 or the next block."
mtgmarketwatch,2qx73c,Uperr,5,Fri Jan 2 17:00:50 2015 UTC,"What about noble hierarch? Is it likely to be reprinted? Owner of my LGS says the price might go up after a reprint, like tarmogoyf did. Does this make sense?"
mtgmarketwatch,2qx73c,Carnilawl,3,Wed Dec 31 15:53:16 2014 UTC,"Everyone thinks that MMA2 will cause price increases on chase mythics like Goyf, but I'm skeptical. WoTC can't feel good about what MMA did (or rather, didn't do) to the accessibility of modern, and I think they'll try and do things differently this time. At the very least they have said that MMA's print run was too small and MMA2 will be larger."
mtgmarketwatch,2qx73c,Brightcab,3,Thu Jan 1 17:36:06 2015 UTC,I will burn a flooded strand and dance on the ashes if noble hierarch isn't in mm 2015.
mtgmarketwatch,2qx73c,adrenic,4,Fri Jan 2 19:13:16 2015 UTC,i want the drugs your lgs owner is on.
mtgmarketwatch,2qx73c,crminshaw,2,Thu Jan 1 04:05:29 2015 UTC,"Seems like a good choice. we can probably narrow down what we think the archetypes will be in MMA2 and go from there. They've already reprinted Exalted once but Noble Hierarch is definitely on a reprint list somewhere.   Incidentally, I remember selling mine when it was in the teens. This was before Modern was a thing, of course.  It's so hard to tell when to sell. Cards are big in standard and the better the card, the longer they go un-reprinted, the more they'll be. I've been shocked to watch prices for Elesh Norn, Karn Liberated, and the Eldrazi steadily rise over the last 4 years.   I remember my gf pulling a foil Liliana of the Veil when Innistrad was in standard. it was $70 bucks at the time and I know I owuld have traded it if I had it. She gave it to me a few years later when it reached $300. This stuff is insane, and I really want to be able ot get an idea for where these prices are going."
mtgmarketwatch,2qx73c,Sav10r,1 point,Wed Dec 31 16:00:17 2014 UTC,I guess a good question is which are more likely to be printed in a standard set and which won't be?
mtgmarketwatch,2qx73c,tmezzo,1 point,Wed Dec 31 15:31:23 2014 UTC,Man lands are more likely to be reprinted in a standard set than the zen fetches.
mtgmarketwatch,2qx73c,crminshaw,3,Wed Dec 31 15:39:01 2014 UTC,A Linvala reprint would be nice to see.
mtgmarketwatch,2qx73c,davekayaus,2,Wed Dec 31 16:40:17 2014 UTC,What are people's thoughts on Snapcaster? He's not getting reprinted in MMA2 and so far is one of the few cards in Inn block that sees play and isn't seeing some kind of reprint. He's also one of the most played creatures in modern.
mtgmarketwatch,2qx73c,tmezzo,2,Wed Dec 31 18:27:43 2014 UTC,"My thoughts on Snapcaster is that nothing is happening to make his price change at all. The decks that wanted him don't want him any more than they already do. There's not too many new decks that want him (or the saturation of decks that want Snapcaster is already so high that new decks won't push this). I see him sitting in the 25-35 range for another year, maybe 2, before the push goes. We could see him going up in the next year as he's just about reaching that 3 year stage- I don't know enough to say"
mtgmarketwatch,2qx73c,MivNizzet,2,Wed Dec 31 16:22:58 2014 UTC,"Reprint in a standard set - not likely until they bring back flashback mechanic. Safe for at least one more block. Unlikely to be in Fate Reforged or Dragons of Tarkir   Reprint in a modern masters set - probably in the unconfirmed MMA2016. Not released for another year.   Reprint in a duel deck - Possible, as we saw remand in Jace vs Vraska. The upcoming elspeth vs kiora will be using blue, so there may be a small chance of a reprint there.   Reprint in another modern event deck - Again, possible, as the first one proved to be a success. The first one included expensive modern cards like inquisition, dismember, sword, elspeth, kitaki wars wage and path to exile (multiple copies). Shows wizards is willing to include staple cards in sealed product. High chance of the next modern event deck to use blue, due to high value cards demanding a reprint.   I think snapcaster will be safe for another year at least."
mtgmarketwatch,2qx73c,davekayaus,1 point,Wed Dec 31 16:27:03 2014 UTC,"I agree with that but I'd say two years.   As popular as it is, I don't think Modern Masters will become an annual event. Biennial seems more likely. Adding two new blocks plus a core set to the reprint list gives a greater variety between MMA releases and should reduce any risk of 'reprint fatigue'."
mtgmarketwatch,2qx73c,banecroft,2,Wed Dec 31 16:50:45 2014 UTC,Fair points. But what about the fact the fact that after mma was released modern demand increased through new players increasing the prices of many cards? Will that play a role this time around? Also because decks see reprints in cards other cards in said deck increase in value to offset overall deck price. Thoughts?
mtgmarketwatch,2qx73c,davekayaus,1 point,Wed Dec 31 23:45:51 2014 UTC,"That's something I didn't understand. Tarmogoyf going up is something I just don't get- when the supply was so low and price so high...  The only thing I can think of is that it didn't have anything to do with Tarmy itself getting reprinted, but the other modern cards. When the format itself is more approachable then more people will be willing to go out of their way to obtain one.   The other thing I'm most curious about is cards printed in the first MMA getting reprinted again."
mtgmarketwatch,2qx73c,b_fellow,2,Wed Dec 31 16:53:11 2014 UTC,"The reason Goyf—and other high demand mythics—rose after MMA is that the set raised demand for the format (and by proxy, staples) more than it introduced new supply of those staples into the market. It's unlikely that MMA2 will do the same."
mtgmarketwatch,2qx71p,maxmackie,5,Wed Dec 31 14:44:42 2014 UTC,"I'd keep it. Foil fetches are probably at a low point right now and will remain so for a few more months. It may not see as much play as the blue fetches in the current Modern/Legacy meta, but there is no saying what the future brings.   Also, I think foil Wooded Foothills is the best looking Khans of Tarkir foil fetchland. Dat snow ;)"
mtgmarketwatch,2qx71p,GHChinMTG,3,Wed Dec 31 14:58:40 2014 UTC,Keep it as long as possible as foil staples always go up.  Look at the RTR shocks for example
mtgmarketwatch,2qx71p,b_fellow,3,Wed Dec 31 15:23:39 2014 UTC,Keep it. Foil specs on stuff like this is usually always better than the non-foil.
mtgmarketwatch,2qx71p,Chosler88,2,Wed Dec 31 19:05:52 2014 UTC,"The only reason to get rid of it would be if you can use the cash to buy cards you need (finish a deck, etc). If you don't have any cash or card needs, keeping is the better idea."
mtgmarketwatch,2qx71p,GrossoGGO,1 point,Wed Dec 31 21:01:02 2014 UTC,it obviously depends on if you need something more than the foothills and wouldn't mind getting rid of the foothills to get what you need.   i for one try to trade for every foil ktk fetch i see in a trade binder as i am a foil whore.
mtgmarketwatch,2qx71p,nikkoplease,1 point,Wed Dec 31 18:58:48 2014 UTC,"Keep all foil fetches, unload the others in sale and trade. Then near the end of FRF and DOT attain more fetches. They'll sink a bit further."
mtgmarketwatch,2qx71p,Sniffygull,0,Fri Jan 2 03:16:00 2015 UTC,If you plan to keep it long term then I'd try to make a complete playset of it.  It'll be more profitable to unload a full playset 3-5 years down the road instead of just a single.  Just my thought on the matter.    OR   Trade it to me.
mtgmarketwatch,2qxphn,Shadowheals,3,Wed Dec 31 17:48:23 2014 UTC,"I'd sell. Yes, as a foil it's a card that won't fall hard on a reprint, but the effect of a reprint is that it won't rise at all either.  Therefore you'd be better off with the money today, than the same amount of money in a few months (IMO)."
mtgmarketwatch,2qxphn,davekayaus,2,Wed Dec 31 23:20:42 2014 UTC,"This. Also, while the price likely won't change, it'll likely be a lot harder to move, since you're restricting buyers from ""want Scalding Tarn foil"" to ""want old Scalding Tarn foil,"" which is a much smaller subset."
mtgmarketwatch,2qxphn,Encendi,0,Thu Jan 1 04:13:35 2015 UTC,"Nice pulls! Regarding the value of the scalding tarn, I would keep it for a little longer. Yes there is a high chance of it being reprinted in the next 1/2 years, but that may not effect the price much. Look at polluted delta from onslaught.   http://www.mtgstocks.com/cards/6620   As it was reprinted in Khans of Tarkir, the regular non-foil price dropped by 50%. However, the foil onslaught copies barely shifted, and at most dropped around 15%.   Scalding tarn is one of the most sought after fetches due to the popularity of delver and storm in both modern and legacy. This means there will always be a demand for it, and it will hold value due to it being a blue land. When the modern and legacy season starts again, it could see a small price change, and you may wish to consider selling it then. Only time will tell.   However, remember that the longer you hold it for, the higher chance it will be reprinted, which could also bring down the price a little.   It's up to you, but I honestly don't think that a reprint will cause the price to plummet, and it certainly won't be spiking any time soon."
mtgmarketwatch,2qxphn,crminshaw,2,Wed Dec 31 18:08:25 2014 UTC,"While I agree that it probably won't be hit as heavily by a reprint as it's the original printing, I feel that the Onslaught fetches aren't a perfect example, as they're the only fetches which use the old border; Scalding Tarns, however, have only ever been printed with one of the modern borders, so there's a good chance that the difference between a theoretical DTK/MM2 Tarn and a ZEN Tarn won't be quite as drastic."
mtgmarketwatch,2qxphn,Nightfirecat,1 point,Wed Dec 31 18:53:09 2014 UTC,"A fair point. Maybe this wasn't the best example, but I was simply trying to point out that the price didn't change much due to a reprint."
mtgmarketwatch,2qxphn,crminshaw,1 point,Wed Dec 31 19:01:09 2014 UTC,"A better example would be shocks from the original Ravnica block, which a reprint did very little to move the foil prices of the highly played shocks."
mtgmarketwatch,2qxphn,chanmancan,1 point,Wed Dec 31 23:15:46 2014 UTC,"A reprint is absolutely eminent. If not in Dragons of Tarkir, (which I think it will be), and if not in MM15, then very soon after. I only see the value falling from here."
mtgmarketwatch,2qxphn,the_chandler,0,Wed Dec 31 21:39:11 2014 UTC,"Foils of Legacy and Vintage staples will rarely go down. Additionally, if the enemy fetches are reprinted it will most likely be with new artwork, so the original art foil will remain valuable. Short answer: hold forever unless you really need money."

mtgmarketwatch,2qwflw,mikesgordon,2,Wed Dec 31 15:45:59 2014 UTC,Agree. Reddit's very basis is to allow people to decide what they want to see and vote accordingly. MTGfinance does not allow many people to downvote articles on their sub for some reason.

I've been watching this card for two months at this point and didn't write about it publicly until I was sure we were near the tipping point, because I don't want to hype a card that isn't deserving of recognition. The way this thing was moving this double-up would have happened in the next month even if no writer said a word.  But if I helped a few people get in on this card cheaply before that window closed, I'm okay with that :)"
mtgmarketwatch,2qvuvn,Chosler88,1 point,Wed Dec 31 07:21:53 2014 UTC,"Every card has a level of real demand for it, set by players and collectors.  When finance writers zero in on a card, they create false demand for it via speculators.  The speculators swoop in, buy up copies, and spike the price.  The real question is:  What's the actual play demand for the card?  Are there enough EDH players looking for G-LAD to justify a $4 price?  Or is the card only $4 today because a bunch of speculators read an article and all jumped on TCGPlayer at the same time?  Sometimes finance articles help establish the right price for a card.  Example: Splinter Twin. Sometimes finance articles create false demand for a card and fuck up the market.  Example: Birthing Pod."
mtgmarketwatch,2qvuvn,Fluxxed0,1 point,Wed Dec 31 14:44:54 2014 UTC,"I think you're right about there being finance articles that make false demand, but I don't think Pod was one. The articles writing in response to that were unaware of a third party buying a whole lot of pods."

mtgmarketwatch,2qvuvn,misterci,5,Wed Dec 31 04:04:55 2014 UTC,"Yeah very important. I was going to include some simple guessing, but forgot to. Assuming you bought a playset at $8, and could out it at $16 now you wouldn't actually be making that much. Assuming ~20% in fees and $2 shipping, your actually making $10.8 revenue or $2.80 profit. So your best bet would be trading at your local shop but even then people are only after singletons so you're going to have them sitting in inventory for a while."
mtgmarketwatch,2qvuvn,tikitack,1 point,Wed Dec 31 04:10:37 2014 UTC,"Agreed. Especially since Commander cards are one of. It makes specs like these especially difficult to unload to non-buylists since real people are only looking to buy (or for the commander crowd, more likely trade) for 1 copy.  Also, TCGMid is still $2. So if you are trying to trade them away, you might want to use a different source than TCGMid for values"

mtgmarketwatch,2qvuvn,swskeptic,2,Wed Dec 31 07:36:36 2014 UTC,"That has $2 shipping, and the $1.75 has $2.99 shipping. A playset is $18, so I said $4 each is a safe estimate."
mtgmarketwatch,2qvuvn,Chosler88,-5,Wed Dec 31 07:39:00 2014 UTC,You shouldn't use shipping as well.
mtgmarketwatch,2qvuvn,mikesgordon,6,Wed Dec 31 08:12:23 2014 UTC,"So there's no difference between a card priced at 99 cents with $5 shipping and a card priced at $1.99 with free shipping? People play with the retail/shipping numbers on TCGPlayer to affect their spot in the page, but at the end of the day what matters is what you're paying to have that card arrive at your house, and that includes shipping."
mtgmarketwatch,2qwdtp,kahluahandcream,3,Wed Dec 31 06:54:23 2014 UTC,"I haven't seen anything I really like, so it's been okay. I like the potential of manifest with Hooded Hydra, so I'm waiting for a sign that manifest is standard playable to get in on the Hydra.   I see CFB selling Temporal Trespass on TCG for $10, so if anyone wants that go for it. I don't see it being good, at least based on my UR Delver Deck in modern I would rather play Cruise, if that is banned Dig, and if that is banned I still probably wouldn't play Temporal Trespass. Not sure what deck people see that slotting in to.   As usual the mythics seem way overpriced, but especially the Lifelinking spells one. Sure burn sideboard for the mirror, but Dragon's Claw seems to do similar while not dying to the same burn spells you're siding against.  Edit: Actually, the new Moonform spoiler certainly makes me thinking manifest could be real or at least FNM level playable. Time to grab a playset... foil or non foil..."
mtgmarketwatch,2qwdtp,mtd14,3,Wed Dec 31 07:09:18 2014 UTC,"I think one of the draws about Temporal Trespass is how a lot of people quickly dismissed Delve when it was first spoiled in KTK. Dig Through Time was a $2 until Pro Tour KTK. With the potential of Cruise and Dig being banned in Modern, this would be a crappy card to miss out on considering its a small set mythic."

mtgmarketwatch,2qwdtp,OutofStep,7,Wed Dec 31 08:30:03 2014 UTC,"I realize that I'm posting in a MTG Finance subreddit, but... really? Leading up to Khans, one of the biggest items on everyone's wish list for reprints were fetch lands (you do remember $90 Polluted Deltas, right?). Now we get fetch lands at a price that everyone can afford, giving more people the opportunity to get them for all the formats, and we're complaining that they're too abundant?  Ugh."
mtgmarketwatch,2qwdtp,Gordonuts,1 point,Wed Dec 31 14:04:58 2014 UTC,"Different voices complaining. Originally players wanted more affordable fetches, now MTG financiers are complaining that they can't profit from them as easily. Can't please everyone"
mtgmarketwatch,2qwdtp,Rock-swarm,1 point,Wed Dec 31 17:38:16 2014 UTC,"The problem is that the ""financiers"" complaining about the supply glut are morons for forgetting that KTK fetches are also a standard manabase staple, which means they still obey every other standard mana-cycle price path. /u/veracite can still flip them literally a year from now at their standard high point, then re-buy into them just after rotation and continue making profits from squatting on the inevitable modern/legacy/edh demand a few years from now.  Posting to complain about a WotC marketing strategy that has little bearing on his ability to make money off fetches just highlights his ignorance."
mtgmarketwatch,2qwdtp,Gordonuts,1 point,Thu Jan 1 03:11:41 2015 UTC,"I think you're being overly harsh. The additional reprints will affect people's ability to make money off the fetches.   Let's say you bought Polluted Deltas at $15, thinking that was the floor. If they weren't going to be in FTR $15 might have been the floor, and they could have gone up to maybe $20 in a year, allowing you to make a profit. Now their floor is probably more like $10, and they may increase to $15... exactly what you paid for them... so I can understand people being frustrated,  but hey.. there are no guarantees in MTG finance except the reserved list, and the additional copies are good for players. Plus the presence of Shocks in GTC should have telegraphed this."
mtgmarketwatch,2qwdtp,Tebwolf359,2,Thu Jan 1 18:22:04 2015 UTC,"I'm fine with there being expensive cards.  I think it's fine that cards like 'goyf are $100+.   The market is an important part of what has kept the game vibrant.  That said, I fully approve of the stance Wizards has taken with the shocks and fetches.  Mana bases should not be the most expensive part of the deck.   The lands should be reprinted as much as needed to ensure a healthy supply.  If lands are easily accessible, that should help the prices of the rest in some ways go up.  If I can afford the mana bases, then I m more likely to want to run multiple decks.  That adds demand to some of the other cards."
mtgmarketwatch,2qwdtp,Nibki,1 point,Thu Jan 1 02:37:23 2015 UTC,"Do not worry about that. Shocks inclusion on Gatecrash didn't diminished the prices during their standard living. Now it seems the market will be flooded with fetches everyewhere and people wouldn't agree in paying a ton for them, but just wait until there's no KTK block product being drafted as new sets appear. Immediately they will go up. The only thing you could worry is about a substancial number of players leaving the game and thus a drecreasing interest for MTG, but that will affect any spec you do. I think, anyway, you will wait less than you think, but do not be very greedy waiting for the ideal price, or you could easily miss the train."
mtgmarketwatch,2qwa4u,EsportsLottery,8,Wed Dec 31 06:11:03 2014 UTC,I dont think this is a spike target as much as a long term grower. With UR Delver performing so well currently the demand for Deathrite is really low.
mtgmarketwatch,2qwa4u,amich45,3,Wed Dec 31 07:11:01 2014 UTC,Best time to buy into staples is when they're not being played.
mtgmarketwatch,2qwa4u,Fluxxed0,3,Wed Dec 31 14:55:52 2014 UTC,agreed. Competitive magic ebbs and flows. The card is powerful. There are also like 20 deathrite shaman for each serious legacy player.
mtgmarketwatch,2qwa4u,jimini-christmas,5,Fri Jan 2 02:53:31 2015 UTC,"I'll quote my own article:  ""Deathrite Shaman started the day at about $14. I expect it to end the next week or two under $10, and that’s when I want in. If Legacy and Modern staple Snapcaster Mage can cost more than $20 two years after being printed, surely Deathrite can push $15 from Legacy play.  ""This is not a short-term target. You’re not going to buy these this week and sell them next week or next month for double the profit. But I do know if you’re the person buying when others are panic selling, you’re going to be the guy looking really good a year or two from now.""  I appreciate you citing my article, but I would note that ""I expect it to end the next week or two under $10, and that’s when I want in"" is substantially different than the ""pick these up after the banning at $10"" you claimed I wrote.  As for the spec itself, It looks like I overestimated how fast this would move. Of course, the landscape has also changed quite a bit since then, namely with True-Name and now Treasure Cruise pushing out Deathrite strategies. When I considered things that it would take to push Deathrite out of the format, I didn't plan for the possibility they were going to print a busted graveyard-dependent Ancestral to crowd out DRS. That said, Legacy is cyclical, and I still believe this was and is a good target.  Not every spec hits, and that's okay. The important thing is that the reasoning behind the spec was sound, and I believe it was and is. After all, I don't think it's a stretch to believe that Deathrite could still be $15 a year from now."
mtgmarketwatch,2qwa4u,Chosler88,2,Wed Dec 31 07:57:51 2014 UTC,"Hey Corbin, which of these do you think are best as longterm specs?  Stone-forge mystic  True name nemesis  JTMS  Karakas  Tundra  Conversely, are any of these particularly bad targets for long term gains? Thanks!"
mtgmarketwatch,2qwa4u,Carnilawl,5,Wed Dec 31 18:11:14 2014 UTC,"This is a tough question, but I'll try. It's hard because it's difficult to define what's best since they have such vastly different entry points.  Stoneforge and True-name are the cheapest, and will probably never be bad in Legacy. Both could double in the next two years. Or, they could be reprinted and drop in half. It's hard to know. So while they're certainly the easiest to get into, they're also risky because I place their reprint possibility the highest.  Jace has actually continued to slide under $100, but is Jace. I doubt the price really plummets any time soon. A safe target, but one that will only experience slow growth and isn't on the reserved list either. Karakas falls into the same boat. Expensive to buy into and not protected from reprints, though like Jace one anytime soon is unlikely. It's up $40 from a year ago, but has been steady for 8 months now. Again, not likely to see a spike.  Tundra is the most expensive but the safest, being on the reserved list. Furthermore, it seems to have found a plateau at $200 after being at $230 months back. We always see the most general growth in the first few months of the year, and I expect all of these to move some in that time.  Most potential for percentage gains in 2015? Stoneforge, then True-Name and Jace. Safest for holding value and showing incremental gains? Tundra and Karakas and then Jace. If you just want to park money somewhere for steady-but-small gains, it's Tundra. Once you factor in the opportunity cost of dropping so much cash in one place, if you're looking for big growth in the next six months it's Stoneforge.   Given that you specified long-term, I like, considering nothing but ""what will add more dollars and ignoring opportunity cost"" Tundra and Karakas and then Jace.  Hope that helps!"

mtgmarketwatch,2qwa4u,minutehourday,1 point,Wed Dec 31 19:40:40 2014 UTC,"Even though legacy has a card that makes DRS worse, it is still a mainstay in the format and is an absolute house and only really sees play as a playset. Foils are where the investments should be made for this card. But I don't think non-foils will ever go above $15 as RTR was printed way more than INN (snapcaster), unless an unbanning in modern was to occur. Then whoever has extra copies laying around will be a happy person"
mtgmarketwatch,2qwa4u,150crawfish,1 point,Wed Dec 31 12:59:17 2014 UTC,"It's an interesting question, and we'll probably have to wait for a Deathrite deck to get some huge time on camera. It feels like a card that is just waiting for a spark to get it going, because everyone knows its powerful. Part of what makes it a good spec is while we wait for the spike we don't have to worry about a reprint because its banned in modern and a low reprint target. So we don't know when it'll spike. Could be days, months, even a year or two, but it's a likely contender for a spike in the future."

I bought 4 Spell Crumples for $2.25 total on eBay because I loved what the card did, then another auction was ending for 10 at $1.75 15 minutes later so I threw in a bid and won those 10 for $2.25 total. Ended up with 14, and when I checked the price like 18 months later it was $5 each so I sold some, traded some to friends, and traded a few into Promo Hinders.   I haven't had any huge failed specs, but I've had a ton of not selling out of cards when I should. Like the foil Gitaxian Probes I have I knew I should sell at $20, but didn't and then MMA2 was announced and now the going price is $13.

mtgmarketwatch,2qwdeq,SinCollector,5,Wed Dec 31 06:48:48 2014 UTC,"So one saying I always hear about sealed boosters is something along the lines of ""the minimum value is set by the estimated value, but the max is set by the drafting environment. For example, on dawnglare a box of INN's EV is $70, but sealed boxes are selling for upwards of $200 because it was a superb limited environment.   MMA was a very fun limited format, so it should have a high ceiling. However it's also at a point where its so expensive that it has a limited market and will be hard to move. Boxes could hit $400, but is $40 ($50*.8 for fees) worth the wait and risk for you? Do you think you could do better buying into cards that won't be reprinted (reserved list, promos, etc) and letting those sit in your binder? I would consider trading sealed MMA boses for duals or reserved list staples because they are safer and I would expect a similar return.

Although as mtd14 already said moving into dual lands or other reserved items is a great way to go.  I would highly recommend that course of action."

mtgmarketwatch,2qwc2f,MilitaryBeetle,5,Wed Dec 31 06:32:07 2014 UTC,"I think it's a great idea to get the students who are strapped for cash and have a collection sitting back at home. I certainly think it is worth doing, perhaps even making a website/email so you can make posters look more official. Offer a very convenient service for the other party (I'll scan through, give a good valuation, come to you, and pay cash) and I can see you getting a few collections."
mtgmarketwatch,2qwc2f,mtd14,3,Wed Dec 31 06:51:59 2014 UTC,"If you're just trying to accumulate cards, probably. I don't think you'll profit significantly. We have the internet in our pockets so chances are, anyone who is willing to sell their collection to you has an idea of what they think their cards are worth OR they've pulled the nice stuff to sell as singles and are just bringing you bulk."
mtgmarketwatch,2qwc2f,JakeTheSheepy,3,Wed Dec 31 06:42:19 2014 UTC,"I disagree. I've bought 3 collections now off of random friends and friends of friends, and tripled my investment in value each time. Granted, I don't always pull amazing rares/mythics, but I do usually pull out a decent chunk of 1-5 dollar cards.  Also, I've been reselling the bulk to a guy who buys in bulk on Craigslist. Sure it takes some time to sort through a collection, but its usually well worth it.   I say post on the board and see if anyone bites. You never know unless you try."

mtgmarketwatch,2qwc2f,jassi007,1 point,Wed Dec 31 13:54:45 2014 UTC,I posted something similar to my college's billboard with zero results.
mtgmarketwatch,2qwc2f,Rohugh,1 point,Wed Dec 31 07:46:19 2014 UTC,"I don't post to the colleges BBS because no one reads those. I pick up at least 2 to 3 collections from the local college though each semester. Wife manages the wow cafe, brother works there/student, mom, dad. All of them keep eyes out for me on who plays at the student center. Every semester I have a few phone calls. It helps having in's with the good LGS nearby also."

Why don't you just do the sign and post it instead of writing this and waiting for the answers ? It's not like it would take you hours of work, just try it...  What would be interesting is what do you get by doing so."
mtgmarketwatch,2qwc2f,MetalFearz,0,Wed Dec 31 08:58:33 2014 UTC,What does this have to do with the market or speculation? I am really confused when I see people posting that this sub isn't just /r/mtgfinance with no mods when this is one of the first 5 posts
mtgmarketwatch,2qwc2f,JasonEAltMTG,7,Wed Dec 31 07:21:59 2014 UTC,"This sub is whatever people want it to be, and I thought this was actually a pretty interesting method for people without connections to buy collections. I could see this doing well at my college where people would go home for the holidays and bring their collections back with them to trade for beer money.   I'll also be interested if there is a follow up saying whether it worked or not."
mtgmarketwatch,2qwc2f,mtd14,0,Wed Dec 31 07:48:37 2014 UTC,Then why not just say that from the beginning?
mtgmarketwatch,2qwc2f,JasonEAltMTG,6,Wed Dec 31 07:54:56 2014 UTC,"Dunno, guess I just assumed it was understood since I said I wasn't going to moderate much. I added it to the sidebar to clarify!"
