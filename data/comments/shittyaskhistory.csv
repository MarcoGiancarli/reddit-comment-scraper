His original Autobahn Guide was essentially a catalog of roadkill: every time he hit a bird he’d immediately stop and paint the animal as it had been in life, then leave the painting to comfort its loved ones. Eventually he decided to have books printed full of paintings of all sorts of birds, so other motorists who hit one could quickly remove the appropriate page and be on their way."

Donatello, the ninja turtle, built a time machine to go back in time to foil one of Shredder's and Krang's evil plans. However, Michael Angelo had been eating pizza on the time machine and he dropped some cheese and oil into the flux compasator. So when they went to use the time machine, it sent them too far back into the past and they ended up in the Renaissance. Sad story is that the machine broke, and they all got stuck.   In order to blend in, they all learned skills to pay the rent. They had to pay rent because there were not any sewers that were large enough to set up base in. They keep this going till Donatello could figure out a way to manufacture replacement parts. This took many many years to complete. During that time they all became master artisans. In order to throw people off the scent of who they were, they had portraits done, sometimes they were self portraits, where they looks human.   Eventually the ninja turtles made it back to their present only to learn that their renaissance selves had become famous. You know, like text book famous."

shittyaskhistory,3druiy,AbouBenAdhem,2,Sun Jul 19 18:41:41 2015 UTC,"Actually, the Romans did not refer to these ""rejects"" as Romantics. They referred to them as ""Frantics"", presumably in reference to their hurrying around to gather belongings and flee freely rather than be captured and forced into exile in chains.  Calling the French Romantics came much later, during the Hapsburg period. Specifically, it is said that Marie-Antionette first used the term. Remember that she was only 14 when shipped off to ""France"" to marry the king-to-be.  She, being schooled, but not one to have excelled at scholarship, thought she was travelling south to Rome. She was also quite horny, but obviously contemporary sources are demure on this fact. One hint of this disposition was that she (admittedly allegedly) told her travelling companions she was keen for ""some antics in Rome"" in anticipation of meeting her husband to be.  As teenagers are wont to do, this phrase entered the vocabulary of her handmaids who were close to her age and they shortened the phrase to ""Rome-antics"" (and giggled most every time they said it, according to the diary of the livery person standing on the back of the coach. There was a screen window in the back of the coach and we can be rather confident that he did in fact hear these ""witticisms"" and was not makign it all up).  When she did arrive in Paris, and not Rome after all, the phrase stuck and she called the boy-king her ""Romantic"".  Furthemore, other sources (I don't have my JSTOR access, but you can search it there yourself), confirm the rise of the term ""Romantics"" after M.A.'s arrival in France."

Sometimes his engine would choke mid-flight, so he would glide back to the airbase and walk away from the plane, which would then explode. One time he forgot the keys and tried to hot-wire the plane, so the plane exploded right at the hangar, rocketing him out. He got injured, but survived (and was demoted). I believe at one point he even tried to seppuku himself out of sheer embarrassment, but since he was injured at the moment, he missed and stabbed a nurse instead.

It is concomitant to the stalled Italian invasion known as the Greco-Italian War. It is usually distinguished from the Battle of Crete, which came after mainland Greece had been subdued. These operations were part of the greater Balkan Campaign of Germany in World War II.  At the time of the German invasion, Greece was at war with Italy, following the Italian invasion on 28 October 1940. The Greeks defeated the initial attack and the counter-attack of March 1941. When Operation Marita began on 6 April, the bulk of the Greek army was on the Albanian border, from which the Italians were trying to enter Greece. German troops invaded through Bulgaria, creating a second front. Greece had already received a small though inadequate reinforcement from British Empire forces, in anticipation of the German attack but no more help was sent after the invasion began. The Greek army found itself outnumbered in its effort to defend against both Italian and German troops. As a result, the Bulgarian defensive line did not receive adequate troop reinforcements and was quickly overrun by the Germans, who then outflanked the Greek forces in the Albanian borders, forcing their surrender. The British Empire forces were overwhelmed and forced to retreat with an ultimate goal of evacuation. For several days Allied troops played an important part in containing the German advance on the Thermopylae position, allowing ships to be prepared to evacuate the units defending Greece.  The German army reached the city of Athens on 27 April a[›] and Greece's southern shore on 30 April, capturing 7,000 British Empire forces and ending the battle with a decisive victory. The conquest of Greece was completed with the capture of Crete a month later. Following its fall, Greece was occupied by military forces of Germany, Italy and Bulgaria.   Hitler later blamed the failure of his invasion of the Soviet Union, which had to be delayed, on Mussolini's failed conquest of Greece.  This explanation for Germany's calamitous defeat by the Soviet Union has been refuted by the majority of historians, who have accused Hitler of trying to deflect blame for his country's defeat from himself to his ally, Italy.  It nevertheless had serious consequences for the Axis war effort in the North African theatre. Von Rintelen emphasizes, from the German point of view, the strategic mistake of not taking Malta.

shittyaskhistory,3bntol,BigKanye,12,Tue Jun 30 18:36:12 2015 UTC,"On a more serious level, Lincoln used to be a Whig, and he was strongly in favor of using public money to finance public infrastructure, especially roads, canals, and railroads. In a speech given in 1838, he said that ""internal improvements"" are obviously necessary and desirable, but that their costs can be prohibitive:   Time and experience have verified to a demonstration, the public utility of internal improvements. That the poorest and most thinly populated countries would be greatly benefitted by the opening of good roads, and in the clearing of navigable streams within their limits, is what no person will deny... The only objection is to paying for them; and the objection to paying arises from the want of ability to pay.   Lincoln was distrustful of allowing private money to finance these public works, because those who financed the works would be the only ones to profit from it:   It seems as though we are never to have an end to this baneful and corroding system, acting almost as prejudiced to the general interests of the community as a direct tax of several thousand dollars annually laid on each county, for the benefit of a few individuals only...   So to me, it seems plausible that Lincoln would have argued that broadband infrastructure is the responsibility of the government, and that just as the costs of that venture would be shared by all citizens, so should the benefits. Charging premium rates for preferential treatment would be anathema to this egalitarian take on infrastructure.  tl;dr: he'd have supported it."

shittyaskhistory,3avk9v,nonsensepineapple,8,Tue Jun 23 21:11:53 2015 UTC,"what you have to understand is that when Tutankhamun was born in 1855, Arizona was still  under Phoenician rule – as it still is today, after all the capital is Phoenix.   Now the Phoenicians had a vendetta against the eighteenth dynasty of  pharaohs ever since King Tut's grandfather, Amenhotep III, made disparaging comments about the Fertile Crescent's hip-hop scene, which are recorded in hieroglyphics as   there is no real Phoenician hip-hop, they have no innovative producers, they can't make beats, their MCs are uninspired and dickless as catamites.. their scene will always be 1500 years behind Egypt's...they still listen to Drake.  these remarks which Plato described as objectively, undeniably true...but still pretty dickish in turn led to the Krieg von zehntausend Tränen or War of Ten Thousand Tears, consequences of which include the birth and subsequent death of Napoleon Bonaparte and the formation of the Commonwealth state of Canada (Canadians were historically the biggest supporters of Phoenician hip-hop).  Part of the treaty by which the war was ended mandated (among other things) that the respective royal families would each generation send their firstborn son as hostage to the other in order to endure ritual humiliation until the age of 32. Thus, for the sins of his father, King Tut was sent to Phoenix on board the Egyptian pharaoh's famous golden Douglas DC-3 (the historical inspiration for the Popemobile made famous by Mussolini).  King Tut spent the first 20 years of his life in drag acting as a starlet by the name of Tatiana Du Frois in Arizona's silent film industry (which was of considerably superior quality to their hip-hop output). His daily routine would consist of performing strangely un-erotic lap-dances for the Dalai Lama of the Arizona Catholic Church and a gruelling make-up routine (an allergic reaction to which left him with his distinctive golden face you can still see on his corpse).  However, when Phoenix was conquered by Alexander the Great in 1921, somewhere amidst the ensuing chaos, King Tut tried a blunt for the very first time. Records from this period are hazy as traditionally when historians documented this formative period of the pharaoh's illustrious life, tradition dictated they blaze it in the spirit of dankest Egypt, resulting in the careless loss and destruction of many vital sources and documents being used as skins, but from what we can gather Tut, losing all interest in kingship and knee-high stockings, the young prince became consumed with finding the dankest of all herbs  made by the gods. After studying cuneiform for ten years whilst high as fuck, he deciphered the Inuit cuneiform of the Epic of Gilgamesh, telling of a prophecy of a son of Egypt cultivating the wildest plants the earth had ever seen in the ancient and mystery-shrouded land of Babylonia, Ireland. The rest, as they say, is history."
