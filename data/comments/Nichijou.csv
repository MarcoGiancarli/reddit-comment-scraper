Nichijou,3e3q2x,SenorStigo,2,Tue Jul 21 20:31:27 2015 UTC,Thanks! I use gimp
Nichijou,3e3q2x,Ausar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:46:12 2015 UTC,OP may use something different but a software that is common and one I use is Adobe Illustrator.

Nichijou,3ahngl,Helicuor,4,Sat Jun 20 08:30:06 2015 UTC,Just wait. June 26th is some kind of reveal for Nichijou.
Nichijou,3ahngl,chrisx8x23x95,3,Sat Jun 20 22:15:17 2015 UTC,Agree with Azumanga Daioh (has more of a slice of life feel) and Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou.  Other recommendations would be:  -Joshiraku (more of a focus on comedy) http://myanimelist.net/anime/12679/Joshiraku  -Tonari no Seki-kun  http://myanimelist.net/anime/18139/Tonari_no_Seki-kun
Nichijou,3ahngl,jon15982,2,Sat Jun 20 22:27:38 2015 UTC,There was a little teaser image of Nichijou posted in some magazine that plenty of people think means a Season 2. Though it's not certain.
Nichijou,3ahngl,VirusControl,6,Sat Jun 20 08:17:38 2015 UTC,It's almost certainly manga related. The chances of a second season are very low.

Nichijou,3ahngl,slibsirk,0,Sat Jun 20 19:43:17 2015 UTC,"Dearest mother. Way before Nichijou, I enjoyed Cromartie High School. It is only 26 episodes of around 10 minutes, and is one of the very few animes that the dubbed version is just as good as the subbed. It is just as random as Nichijou. Only one thing, avoid the Live Action movie.      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHFySGxccKc"

Nichijou,39ebv0,Hungy15,3,Thu Jun 11 08:03:00 2015 UTC,"In Australia Madman released the entire collection on DVD, subbed for roughly $55 AUD. I'm not sure about releases in other countries Edit: currency"
Nichijou,39ebv0,kajaarlz,2,Thu Jun 11 05:07:37 2015 UTC,"Madman will ship internationally. After shipping, it cost me $40 USD last month to buy from them.  You will also need a dvd player that can play region 3 DVDs, however.  edit: For some reason it was cheaper to buy the two volumes separately than it was to buy the bundle, at least when I bought it."
Nichijou,39ebv0,tachibanapc,3,Thu Jun 11 15:16:15 2015 UTC,I have the collection from Madman. I just play it on my computer through VLC.

Fun fact: Before the complete collection DVD was released, both volumes seperately cost $55 AUD each. They both halved price when the bundle came out. Was a happy day for me to say the least."

Nichijou,39ebv0,TheRealMavsZane,2,Thu Jun 11 13:08:54 2015 UTC,"Try here. Buying anime isn't cheap(in any sense of the word), simply because it isn't sold cheap in most cases. If you're interested why, Google can answer this quickly. I also doubt they come with subtitles, if that's a problem. For reference, shipping excluded, buying the regular set will run you 72800円 and the Blu-Ray edition just shy of 100000円, which translate roughly to 580 and 800 USD, respectively.   From the above link you can also purchase the manga for a much, much lower price... But you need to be able to read basic Japanese. I bought all the mangas recently, plus the two Hellvetica Standard volumes for <€100 with shipping to Italy and customs duty(Sneaky Italian customs!) included, which I'm pretty happy with.  Long story short, if you're intending to pay money towards the company that produced it, buy the anime. If you want the author to see some money from your enjoyment, probably buying the mangas is a better bet IMO. If you just wanted to pay a reasonable sum for a TV series you enjoy... You're out of luck, I guess.  Also, it only gets better from the first three episodes. Enjoy. :)"
Nichijou,39ebv0,LiamOS,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:19:43 2015 UTC,"There's a bunch of people that would buy it if it sold now, but we don't matter because it sold like shit when it released.   They're missing their chance, you just have to go with the flow and acquire it in other means."
Nichijou,39ebv0,Tapemaster21,1 point,Thu Jun 11 10:24:47 2015 UTC,Yea I actually just recieved a bootleg copy from someone on ebay. I am really upset at how naive I was to believe this was going to be a legit copy.

Nichijou,39ebv0,Bean888,5,Thu Jun 11 05:07:30 2015 UTC,Kissanime isn't liscenced.
Nichijou,39ebv0,Helicuor,-1,Thu Jun 11 06:32:47 2015 UTC,The Youtube episodes aren't licensed either.
Nichijou,39ebv0,Bean888,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:07:06 2015 UTC,"He was asking how he could watch this show legitimately. You suggested Kissanime, which isn't legitimate."
Nichijou,39ebv0,Helicuor,-2,Thu Jun 11 15:24:50 2015 UTC,"Chill. He/she asked several questions, one of them was:    Am I missing some way to watch this that everyone else seemed to find?   ...and I answered. There's torrents too, and people watched on CrunchyRoll until recently. And now, if they look hard enough, there's more full episodes on Youtube than the first three that they watched there."
Nichijou,39ebv0,Bean888,1 point,Fri Jun 12 00:18:41 2015 UTC,Don't take his last question out of context. I'm reasonably confident he's asking    Am I missing some way to watch this [legitimately] that everyone else seemed to find?
Nichijou,39ebv0,Helicuor,-1,Fri Jun 12 00:27:19 2015 UTC,"Yes, and part of that context was watching unlicensed episodes on Youtube. Why not have responses that address both?    I've seen the first three episodes on YouTube, and I seriously love the show."
Nichijou,39ebv0,Bean888,2,Fri Jun 12 01:04:08 2015 UTC,He was watching unlicensed episodes on YouTube and was wondering if there was some way to watch it liscenced that he was missing out on.
Nichijou,39ebv0,Helicuor,2,Fri Jun 12 01:24:34 2015 UTC,"It just never sold enough to justify reprinting. The show, from what I know, was a failure in the commercial market. The initial run of DVDS and merchandize just didn't sell well enough.   It really sucks because the show is great, one of the best I've ever seen, its definitely a cult classic and seems to have gotten more popular after its commercial failure. I'm hoping that June 26th announcement for Nichijou is the announcement of another season of the anime. People would appreciate it so much more."
Nichijou,399f1r,BronySavant,14,Wed Jun 10 05:15:14 2015 UTC,Prepare to be disappointed.  It's probably just a new volume.

Nichijou,37sf9u,IZFSLE_,2,Sat May 30 05:56:29 2015 UTC,"North American anime/manga licensing is a joke. I've seen a few people ask a big-time manga publisher if Nichijou would be a possible license for them ever. They said they don't think a gag-manga would sell very well over here.   Then they go and license obscure stuff that nobody's ever heard of, like Tomodachi x Monster, whatever the hell that is.  It just irritates me how they say something with an already-established known fanbase wouldn't sell, while they take chances on newly-started-up series that literally no one in the West has ever heard of.  But what do I know, I'm just a guy on the internet."

Nichijou,37ejqv,xGuernica,4,Wed May 27 03:27:43 2015 UTC,"That's really interesting to me. It must be the case that male stereotypes aren't as reinforced or just plain not existent. It's almost a more honest approach imo, guys do like nostalgic and emotional things probably as much as girls do and girls probably like blowing stuff up just as much as the next guy, but in America you're not allowed  really to break those traditional molds without raising some eyebrows."
Nichijou,37ejqv,SenorStigo,10,Wed May 27 14:29:00 2015 UTC,You are the target demographic.
Nichijou,37ejqv,SenorStigo,4,Wed May 27 01:51:40 2015 UTC,"Even though the target demo for Nichijou is males, I think in general you shouldn't care about target demos. My primary interest is in Shoujo-romance series (obviously a female demo) and I'm male."

Nichijou,36rfxh,YAOMTC,3,Thu May 21 23:15:23 2015 UTC,According to Google translate
Nichijou,36rfxh,Kiplacon,1 point,Fri May 22 01:37:44 2015 UTC,"This is reasonably accurate. Google phrases it a bit weird due to the mixing of kana in it. A more accurate translation would be ""This is my way of life!!"", with an emphasis on ""is"", and some weirdness of ""my"" that can't really be translated.  Or so my limited Japanese tells me."

Nichijou,36j7gd,asiekierka,3,Wed May 20 05:08:48 2015 UTC,"I guess he keeps his life rather hidden, he has a website at  http://www.kumomadori.com But there's really not much on it, so hey. I guess the best we can do is to just appreciate his work!"
Nichijou,36j7gd,WhoWantsPie,3,Wed May 20 00:22:26 2015 UTC,"From a Yahoo Answer   ""He is a Japanese mangaka who was born on Dec.29 1977. His family name is Arawi and his given name is Keiichi His most famous work is obviously Nichijou (but he also made a manga entitled Futari Soccer)  Info on Nichijou  Nichijou which started as a sort of gag manga, know has its own anime that is currently airing. The show itself is nice to watch (one of my favs at least). While the title is nichijou, which means like your average everyday, the show is very random. Many compare it to Azumanga Daioh, Lucky Star, and Pani Poni Dash mixed together.  While it resembles other shows, nichijou also has its own style to it. Plus all the characters are very likeable. For example you'll see a trio of girls: Mai=one who fans like to consider a troll, Yuuko=your hilarious idiot character, and Mio=you're kinda ordinary character ( at first i was put off by this and she too even has something different about her which also adds to the humor).  The animation itself is wonderful. Done by Kyoto Animation too. I own a few of the volumes and can tell that the style is almost exactly the same on both manga/anime. For the most part the anime follows the manga (and alot is like word for word exact). The only differences (which dont really take away from the show) is that the order of scenes is different between the manga and anime are not the same, and one of the main characters (Shinonome Nano, who is an android made by/lives with a young scientist called Hakase) goes to school in the manga but stays at home in the show.  Edit:  -Awari Keiichi is a man （even if his cute/funny manga seems to contradict this).  -He was born in the Gunma Perfecture (which I believe can also be called Gunma-ken)  -As for an official website I probably wont provide much help. I know he has a twitter account http://twitter.com/#!/himaraya . I think he has an official site but at the moment it's not much but it seems that it will be updated http://www.kumomadori.com/ """
