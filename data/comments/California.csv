We have something like 4 of the 6 climates which most states only have like 1 or 2. That many different climate regions will result in the natural disaster that come along with them.
California,3e31o1,Rawdll,6,Tue Jul 21 19:40:52 2015 UTC,4 of the 6 climates   which climates are we missing?

California,3e0zg7,imhungrymother,8,Tue Jul 21 05:06:10 2015 UTC,I mostly agree but the one thing that could kind of alleviate prices around here would be if someone buys up a bunch of those crappy old small rundown houses in the valley and tears them down and builds big apartment buildings. You could easily quadruple the number of people in the central valley but then we'd really need something like a functioning subway system or L-train or both.

Some rich guy would just pay slightly less for it than the houses on his left and right, and then the whole neighborhood would hate him for bringing their values down. Granted, building upwards might help a tiny bit, but those units will still be competed for, and they'll be bought and rented by people moving here just as much if not more than by Californians.

Tens of millions of Americans who had home ownership dreams plunked down life earnings on 30-year mortgages for homes, and would like to stay in their homes that they purchased 30 years ago, yes. And when they get old, they might like to pass on their homes to their adult children or sell the home to fund a retirement living elsewhere. They're not necessarily interested in selling their homes to go move somewhere else, or necessarily interested in selling their home, moving somewhere for a year or two, while a duplex or fourplex is built, so that they can downsize and move back into one of them.  You're also competing against young people and immigrant families, who often share bedrooms, and therefore may not spend as much as 50% of their income. Or, they spend as much as 50% of their because they can. Make the city more affordable, and more young people and immigrant families move in. The housing pressure is constant because people move to where the jobs are, and this country adds over a million new legal immigrants (and unknown numbers of illegal immigrants) each year.  The answer of building houses is like the answer of increasing agricultural productivity. It allows for a greater population in a given area. Whether a city or a planet.

I've been seeing lately that housing and rent costs seem to have less to do with overall population and number of housing units, and more to do with whether or not people perceive Los Angeles real estate as a good long term investment.  i.e. The driver is foreign wealth looking to park their money in something tangible, as well as local wealth looking to park their money in something tangible.    I'd like to see how many owned houses are vacant."

California,3e0zg7,luxuries,4,Tue Jul 21 07:29:35 2015 UTC,Yes and no. Lots of outside investors are gobbling up homes and making it harder for locals to enter the market.

California is the best place to live in the US and that's not gonna change anytime soon. So demand is gonna be there no matter how much the politicians screw things up.   Building more housing would be good. Increase development, encroach on environmentally sensitive areas (where isn't environmentally sensitive) and housing prices will go down. Enviros will pitch a fit but will shut up when they are given control over the remaining green areas to keep out hikers and other recreational users and further their anti-human agenda (see Irvine Ranch Conservancy).   Could also deport some people who are not legally allowed to be here. Those people are competing with citizens for low cost housing and are also a strain on social services that could free up money for more affordable housing. Will also screw over lots of businesses that will have to hire lazier people and pay them more.   Could also lessen zoning regulations so alternative housing can be built on smaller parcels of land. Think manufactured homes, container homes, underground homes, bucky fuller geodesic domes and such. This won't go over well with NIMBYs who are gonna see their property values plunge when someone puts a trailer home in next to their McMansion.   Also could make draconian requirements on home ownership here. Make it a requirement that one be a resident here in order to own a home here. That will alleviate the upwards pricing pressure from overseas speculators. That will not go over well with anyone either for obvious reasons."

My career allows me to live wherever I want (as long as I'm in California and within 50 miles of a major interstate or major freeway) :)  I'd love to move back up to the Bay Area, or down by LA, but $60k there just won't work.

There are also quite a few jobs in this area that get you home every day, or every other day, but I don't have enough experience (or endorsements) to do those right now.   The boonies can be full of poverty and crime, but it's not nearly as bad as Detroits 6/7/8 mile.

They're all in Northern California, there are more job opportunities, and they get much more rain than Southern California does. It also doesn't get to 110 degrees in the summer up there (usually).   There are plenty of very nice rural areas up there.

I'm imagining self-driving electric cargo transport vehicles that travel on electrified freeway lanes. Terminals would be set up at key locations throughout the state (ports, airports, industrial centers, etc). A standard shipping container could be automatically transported from one terminal to another terminal via self driving vehicles. Diesel trucks and/or short-range electric trucks would pick up the container from the terminals and deliver them locally.  Would be expensive to set up, but I imagine such a system would be significantly cheaper than transporting containers via individual trucks (no driver, etc.). Also, the electrified freeway lanes could be reserved for passenger cars only during morning and evening commute times. Otherwise, containers could be shipped 24/7, with cheaper rates late at night.  I think this would be better overall for the state and environment than the HSR, and probably quite a bit cheaper.  Could probably even substitute a passenger container for a shipping container and ship people around on the same infrastructure."

Best case, he's proposing that California implement measures to encourage freight hauling vehicle manufacturers to gradually move away from the same old diesel-drives-the-wheels design and into hybrids and eventually all electric as the technology matures. Worst case, he's proposing nonsense like what the legislature came up with 15 years ago or so, where they mandated that a certain percentage of cars sold in the state must be electric, as if you can force consumers as a whole to buy a certain number of non-existent cars by passing a law.

Trucks need a lot of torque and horsepower to pull those loads, and even with similar fuels like bio-diesel there is a noticeable drop in power when hauling a heavy load.  As for trains and ports, those can be accomplished with electrification of tracks (since diesel train engines are just generators anyway) and onshore power."

Maybe if you run it without any tuning adjustment you'd have issues, but it's perfectly capable of the application.  Now, I agree Biodiesel isn't a solution, but because of it's supply issues, not because there's any reason it wouldn't work as a fuel. We are extremely good at combustion engines, if it's liquid and it burns we could fuel a truck on it."

California,3dtyx1,coredumperror,0,Sun Jul 19 19:02:38 2015 UTC,"I think the problem with that is the engine would be too heavy. With trains they can get away with it, since the weight ratio of the huge engine vs the REALLY, REALLY heavy cargo is much lower than putting a huge engine on a single truck.

Plus, Electric vehicles are more efficient at slower speeds and such, unlike gas vehicles. You could probably complete a fair portion of a day's work, If not the entire day, in that range. Then, You just plug in to charge and go home. Remember that each trip requires loading and unloading, Which may or may not take a while. We could search for the statistics, However, This seems like it would be fine.  As years go on, Batteries will get cheaper, And electric vehicle engines will get cheaper, As well as more efficient. In a few years, they may be able to go 80-100 km for a similar cost. Subsidies could help with the cost, As well as getting Tesla esque giga factories built for batteries and electric vehicle engines."

I'd much rather see resources pushed into picking the low hanging fruit (trucks, commuters) than trying to sort-of carbon-free everything, and the best way to push that is going to be by expanding our system of carbon pricing."

California,3drwj3,BentAxel,2,Sat Jul 18 22:30:52 2015 UTC,Car pool lanes are marked with a large diamond and are separated by double yellow lines. They are for vehicles with more than one person or specially marked vehicles (electric cars and the like with proper passes). The left lanes are used for passing or for going fast in CA :-) Be safe out there and have fun.
California,3drwj3,abycatgrl,4,Sat Jul 18 21:50:49 2015 UTC,Most HOV lanes in NorCal are not separated by double yellows. They do have the diamond marking and signage tho.
California,3drwj3,MattJC123,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:11:39 2015 UTC,I was taught the left lane is for passing and slower traffic should keep to the right.

But have someone in a BMW late merge and I get pissed and god help them if they cross the double yellow to get in carpool lane while I'm illegally driving in it.

I was coming back from Tahoe a few weeks ago driving 5 MPH over the speed limit in the middle lane on a 3-lane highway. A relative was following right behind me in another car. CHP drove past me and told me on PA system to pull over since there was a car behind me, so apparently the law is somewhat enforced.  Must have looked funny to the CHP when I moved over to the slow lane and the car behind me also moved over.  Keep in mind that in some areas, carpool lane requires 3 or more passengers."

California,3drxty,shepards_hamster,2,Sat Jul 18 21:48:09 2015 UTC,"Breakfast: First Awakenings.  Or Kathy's.  Old Monterey Cafe is dece.  First Awakenings is far and away the best, but Kathy's po-tay-toes are awesome.  Activities: Cannery Row, Asilomar Beach, Hwy 1 down to Big Sur and back, stopping at the turn outs along the way.  Lover's Point is a pretty cool area, though I think Latitudes is closed now.  I've seen Humpbacks there before.  Can go check out the elephant seals down at the Coast Guard pier.  There's some really nice dunes west of the highway at Sand City, good for a stomp.  Carmel-by-the-sea is another awesome area to walk around.  Everything's pricey there, but there's a cool candy shoppe by Isabella's (and Isabella's duck ravioli is the tits if you want to splurge).   Carmel Valley has some great wine tasting, but it's like a 30min drive.  There's also some tasting rooms near the InterContinental that are pretty cool.  17 Mile Drive costs like $9 and a lot of the houses are obscure, but you can check out Pebble and walk around the shops there.  The Del Monte Center has gone kinda downhill, I'd probably avoid it.  Don't you dare eat at Bubba Gump's for dinner, it's horrible.  Fish Hopper is excellent, Abalonetti's is okay, Sapporo is a lot of fun (and London Bridge is right underneath it), Indian Summer is good if yer craving that, Hula's is alright but nothing special, El Torito has excellent views, Louie Linguini is pretty nice and has some outdoor seating... The best restaurant in town is the Sardine Factory, but if I was gonna take my wife one place to eat it would be the Fish Hopper.  Great sea food, right on the water, none of that Bubba Gump's bullshit.  If yer gonna be there for lunch go to Compagno's.  Bars:  Yer gonna get a lot of military folks.  Britannia Arms, Crown and Anchor, London Bridge, are staples.  Cibo has live jazz, the club above it sucks.  Lodging:  Sand City or Seaside is cheaper than Monterey proper or Pacific Grove.  Ramada there is alright.  Best Western has two locations near dunes, I forget which is which but one is like 20 min north of downtown Monterey, almost to Marina, but has nice rooms on some dunes.  There's also one much closer in with a similar name.  If you know anyone in the military or retired from it, the Navy Lodge is like $70/night."

There's some fuzziness about where in relation the tanker was to the ground and the drone when it was spotted, but the drone wasn't all that high above the terrain considering that tankers get ~100 - 200 feet above the ground when deploying.  Furthermore, hobbyist drones of that type can hit 10,000+ ft. A Bixler, for example, has a 4 ft wingspan and there are a few videos of them at or way above that altitude."

California,3dmcyz,absolutebeginners,7,Fri Jul 17 20:49:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah pointing out racism is the REAL racism right guise?!   Here is the origin if you care to look it up. It is only used against black people.    Dindu Nuffin is a pejorative term that originated on /pol/ to mock and criticize black people during the numerous riots throughout 2014 and 2015.  The phrase “dindu nuffin” is derived from a bastardization of the phrase “didn’t do nothing”, a plea for innocence often used in reference to unarmed black men killed by police. One of the most famous instances of the usage of this phrase can be found in a comic. Detractors often use “dindu nuffins” to refer to sympathizers of the black community.  The phrase originated on /pol/ around August 2014[1], during the riots in Ferguson, Missouri started as a response to the shooting of Michael Brown."

Then you would be shocked to hear that what you thought was a silly meme is only used by racist trolls. If you are a decent person you'd stop using the meme and stop defending people who use the meme. The more you know!    I don't negatively or positively associate stereotypes to a race with that phrase. Only the people that point it out do.   Are you intentionally pretending to be dumb are do you actually believe this. It is literally popularized by racist trolls, fucking /r/C__ntown uses it ALL THE TIME. It is even in the title of this news story that they crossposted there."

California,3dmcyz,AtomicGarden,7,Fri Jul 17 20:39:14 2015 UTC,You can't just go banning every single thing you might not like.   You should ban users who dramatically lower the quality of the subreddit by bringing in the racist trolls out of the woodwork. If this fucking site had any spine they'd have banned all the hate subs in one swoop so that this website could actually be profitable. Instead they are totally okay with having a mini-Stormfront on here that leaks over to decent subreddits.
California,3dmcyz,AtomicGarden,7,Fri Jul 17 21:26:06 2015 UTC,"Or you should actually try to have a civilized discussion with the person. Or anyone else for that matter.   But they aren't looking for an honest discussion.   How is anyone going to stop anyone from just creating a new account after being banned?   It won't but if you ban all subreddits whose sole EXISTENCE is to propagate hate then they won't have a place to congregate so they will probably move to another site.   An educated a free society doesn't just ban everything, because that's not an actual solution.   Banning hate speech on a private forum isn't the same as banning hate speech in society in general."

Pretty much everything about the Sierra is better than the mediocre mountains by you. They have a bigger elevation range, the forests are more diverse and healthier, the trees are bigger, the granite is more beautiful, the geology is more interesting, there are more lakes, there are bigger waterfalls, there's more wilderness, etc. Usually there's more snow, too.

California,3dmz2i,charonn0,3,Fri Jul 17 17:50:22 2015 UTC,The grand jury is a political tool that prosecutors use as a reward for wealthy constituents who helped them get elected.  Not unlike when a governor creates judgeships.

Applications of the Bill of Rights against the States are only via the 14th Amendment and only for such rights that the Supreme Court has decided that the 14th Amendment applies. The right to an indictment by Grand Jury has not been applied against the States, and as such only half the states actually use them.    For the most part, California Grand Juries produce reports and civil investigations into the workings of local government, rather than consider criminal matters for indictment. Prosecutors have the option of referring cases to a Grand Jury for indictment, but more often they opt towards using a preliminary hearing with a judge, which is the norm in most states and in other Common Law countries.    The US is the only common law jurisdiction that retains the regular use of Grand Juries. They can be capricious, biased, and inconsistent, which is why their use is not as common as it once was"

California,3dl476,Westbrook000,14,Fri Jul 17 03:44:07 2015 UTC,"List of National Parks, Monuments, and Seashores to go to:   Point Reyes National Seashore (near San Francisco) Redwoods State and National Parks (North of Eureka) Lava Beds National Monument (kind of in the middle of nowhere; just south of the Oregon border and about half an hour south of Klamath Falls, OR) Lassen Volcanic National Park (east of Redding) Yosemite National Park (North of Fresno, CA) Death Valley National Park (middle of absolutely nowhere on the east side of the Sierra Nevadas)   This is assuming that you start in LA and make your way up the coast before turning inland after the Redwoods Parks and then down the east side of CA, possibly crossing into Nevada on Hwy 395. Unfortunately, Yosemite might be too far out of your way, but I think that it's the nicest of all the parks that I mentioned. I'm pretty sure that Tioga Pass is open right now, but it would probably be a four hour round trip from Hwy 395 down to Yosemite Valley and back. Death Valley might be skippable depending on how much you like the desert.  Lava Beds is way out of the way, but I have a special fondness of it. It's pretty barren and there's not that many people there. Point Reyes is good for day hiking. I've never been to Muir Woods (between SF and Point Reyes), but I've heard that it's nice. It might be worth going to if you don't want to drive all the way up past Eureka.  If you have the time, I'd suggest taking Hwy 1 up the coast when possible. It will take longer, but I've heard that it's gorgeous.  I've been to all 58 counties in CA, so feel free to ask any questions (I haven't been everywhere within those counties though)."
California,3dl476,ApteryxAustralis,3,Fri Jul 17 04:53:50 2015 UTC,"Oh this is so perfect. I was hoping a California expert would come along and let me ask some questions.  First off thanks for the great first post.  I’m not really interested in visiting the big cities, mostly because it’s expensive to stay the night in/near them and navigating and parking them is a hassle. I don’t mind driving through the cities but I don’t have much desire or enough time to really explore them. Plus I’ve been to LA and San Fran before.  What I’m really looking for, and it seems like you’re on the right path already, is unique, interesting, out-of-the-way places. Small towns, state parks, awesome cultural or natural areas that aren’t just going to be overrun with tourists.  For what it’s worth, I was thinking of maybe working my way up Western CA on a combination of the 1, 101 and I-5. Then when I hit the redwoods and northern CA, turn inland, and then cut through Yosemite, and come back down on the east side of the Sierras.  I’ve been to Death Valley before, and I don’t really feel like tackling the summer heat there at the moment. Maybe I’ll stop in quickly or something.  So, do you think my route idea is decent? And if so, any thoughts on places, towns, state parks, national parks, and other areas to be sure to hit up along the way?  Are there enough gas stations along highway 1 to travel for decent stretches?"
California,3dl476,poster_nutbag_,5,Fri Jul 17 05:08:12 2015 UTC,"I would definitely not skip big sur. It is a very impressive area that provides a taste of both southern California and northern California. You get mountains on the ocean with a mix of succulents, sequoias, and palm trees.   Also I would opt for Joshua Tree NP over Death Valley. They are similar but jtree has more vegetation and some excellent rocks for bouldering or even just admiring strange, alien looking formations."
California,3dl476,ApteryxAustralis,2,Fri Jul 17 14:01:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  You could take 101 all the way from LA to the SF area, but you would miss a lot. Everything that I've heard says that the Big Sur area between San Simeon (home of Hearst Castle, which is pretty busy (they only do guided tours)) and Monterey is really nice. That's where pictures like this are from. If you fill up somewhere around San Luis Obispo (there's a Costco on the south side of town), then you can easily make it to Monterey on a third of a tank without having to pay the folks in Gorda $5.50 a gallon.   I would take 101 up to San Luis Obispo and then take 1 up towards Monterey. Solvang, which is between Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo is worth a stop (credit to /u/AnimeKid). It's a quaint Danish inspired town  Hwy 1 north of SF is a lot more isolated. Gas probably should be an issue there, but you might want to plan in advance. If you follow Hwy 1 north of San Francisco, Fort Ross is worth a quick stop. It was a Russian fur trading outpost from the early 1800's. Hwy 101 would be a lot quicker to go from SF to Redwoods (I'm assuming that you'll go through SF on your way even if you don't spend much time there). There's also some populated areas like Ukiah, so gas shouldn't be an issue. Leggett, which is between Ukiah and Eureka, has a drive through tree, which is worth the $5 or so it takes to go in, wait in line, and have a passenger get out and take a pic for you.  The biggest problem is getting from the redwoods near Eureka to Yosemite. I would suggest taking Hwy 299 from Eureka through Weaverville (which, according to Wikipedia, has a small Taoist temple from 1874 that might be interesting for you) and through Redding over to Lassen Volcanic National Park. If you haven't been to somewhere with a lot of geothermal activity, a short hike to Bumpass Hell might be interesting while you're in Lassen.  If you don't go to Lassen, following 101 back down to 20 and taking 20 to 5 to 99 to 108 to 120 to get to Yosemite would probably be your best bet. That would be an extremely long drive though (I'm guessing 8 hours of drive time at least, probably more like 10ish). California is the third biggest state, so there's a lot of driving.  Going from Lassen to Yosemite might take a while if you want to drive through the smallish towns of the Sierras like Nevada City-Grass Valley, Placerville, Jackson, etc. Coloma is along Hwy 49 (which may be a nice scenic route to follow), but it's a bit touristy. Coloma is where James Marshall discovered gold in 1848. Lassen to Yosemite would be a pretty long day (about 7 hours of driving not including stops) especially if you wanted to stop somewhere like Coloma (Coloma is quite popular with regional elementary schools, so the summer might be one of the better times to see it).  If you do go over Tioga Pass to the east side of the Sierras, Mono Lake might be worth a stop (Mono Lake is close to the junction of Hwy 120 out of Yosemite and 395, which goes on the east side of the Sierras). It's pretty barren. I've never had a chance to stop, but it has always looked neat. Bodie is a ghost town about 20 miles or so north of Mono Lake. It would be worth a look if you have time. There's not that many people there at least in the late fall. I'm not sure how it is in the summer. Going down 395, there's not that much that I know of. Manzanar was interesting. It was a Japanese internment camp in WWII. It's south of Bishop. Apparently they've reconstructed some of the buildings there. There wasn't that much when I went about 8 or so years ago.  As someone who has lived in the central valley for all 22 years of my life, if you're a tourist, stay the fuck away from the Central Valley. It's mostly pasture and farmland with a few crappy towns on hwy 99 and no towns on hwy 5 south of Stockton. North of Sacramento really isn't that much different. It's just not that great. It is quick, I'll give it that. So, maybe take it if you don't end up going through Lassen between the Redwoods and Yosemite, but there's not that much of anything to look at.  I'm not sure if you could fit that all in a week though. Maybe 8-9 days if you have two weekends bookending a week.   I'm guessing that you're starting around LA. Figure on a day or so to drive 101 and 1 to the SF area (maybe Santa Cruz might be cheaper than SF) and then north towards the Redwoods. Spend a day in the Redwoods, then the following day, drive to Lassen. Burney Falls is a nice state park near the intersection of Hwy 299 and 89, which is close to Lassen. Depending on when you get to Lassen, go to Bumpass Hell (it reeks of sulfur, fyi) either that day or the next day. Then drive down Hwy 49 (you might need to take a few other mountain roads to reach it) towards Yosemite, stopping in a gold rush era town. Spend a full day in Yosemite, then drive over Tioga pass to Bodie/Mono Lake and drive down to Bishop (there should be a fair amount of relatively cheap lodging here). Go to Manzanar and then drive down 395 through the desert towards LA. I'm not sure that I would want to go to Death Valley right now either. It's supposed to reach 115 degrees tomorrow. Ick. Death Valley is a long ways from 395, so I wouldn't bother especially given that you've been there already.   I think that's about a week or so. Maybe add a day if you want to knock around somewhere. Perhaps go to Lava Beds National Monument as a day trip out of Lassen or something. Yosemite may also be worth an extra day."

Plenty of great food, all local except for a burger king,and a subway. After Mariposa, the closer you get to the park, it only gets more beautiful. El Portal, about 20 miles up hwy 140 from Mariposa, a few bars & Restaurants, and wonderful scenery. I must caution you, if you need anything, gas, food, cash, ect.

California,3dl476,schnoper,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:59:19 2015 UTC,"One week means over 200 miles/day. You'd shoot by lots of the stuff people are mentioning here. Rein it in a bit.  If I were you (I do a lot of road trips in the West and avoid cities too) I'd pick a route emphasizing the blue highways, the two-laners, and avoid freeways like the plague. That immediately means you miss the cities.  So lets look at the best, long stretches of two-laners in the state (BTW, check motorcycle sites for tips, like Pashnit; we HATE superslab).  *Highway 1: best from Morro Bay to Monterey, and SF to 101. Lots of 25MPH, but many places to stay, eat, etc. All coastal; you'll hit stuff like Pt Reyes, redwoods, surf.  *395: Parts in SoCal down 'round Escondido are OK; but gets better  north of Cajon Pass. But quite hot in summer till up around Owens Valley, which can be hot, but runs so close to the mountains you can zip up to stay or camp or hike. Arid; wide open, near a bunch of parks and spectacular scenery.  *49: general N/S, all nice, but hot in summer. It's (duh) the gold rush history route, if you're into that. Lots of inns, whitewater, twisty and slow in parts. That side of the Sierra is more gradual, as contrasted with the steep dramatic slopes on the east side.  *20: nice W/E route, twisty in parts. Coastal over Mendocino Mtns, then across the Valley (and I disagree that there aren't nice places there, like SNWF, but not in summer), then up through gold country to near Tahoe.  *299: basically following a big NorCal river, from big redwoods at the coast, up to mountains, over by volcanic Shasta, and out to really remote CA and Warner Mtns. Real slow.  There are others, but these can be the basis of a loop. Much of the SoCal area east of the metropolis is just too hot in summer; I dunno when you're going but if summer, forget it.  These road would pretty much give you a flavor of all types of CA: north and south coast, coastal redwood, coastal mountains, Central Valley, southern Cascades (volcanic), northern and southern Sierra, great basin desert. You'd miss the very interesting Sonoran and Colorado desert in the south, though.  I'd skip 49; heat. And I'd skip Yosemite Valley; crowded; do it another time. And it will really slow you down and isn't worth it, considering all the other stuff you'd then miss. Instead, with this somewhat shorter loop, go up Tioga Road on the east side to Tuolumne Meadows. It's closer on that side.  You'd also miss the more crowded parts of national parks, which tend to attract too many people. For instance, Prairie Creek State Park, or Jedidiah Smith State Park is nicer than Redwood National Park. And Muir Woods is horribly overcrowded; just as nice stuff in Big Basin State Park, or even down in Big Sur.  I dunno what you are doing for lodging. The whole coast and many of the attractions mentioned in this thread can book up. If you're camping, though, much of this route (except the coast) has dispersed camping available, meaning camping outside campgrounds."
California,3diz0w,WalkingOsteoclast,75,Thu Jul 16 17:29:53 2015 UTC,"designed to ensure that drivers are doling out rides fairly to all passengers, regardless of where they live or who they are.    That's a joke. I used to work at a hotel in SF and all the taxi drivers would line up in the morning for guests going to SFO.  They would give the doorman a kickback for an SFO ride. (I think it was 10 bucks at the time.) And they would routinely not go to Hunter's Point, much of Oakland and other areas.  Edit: fuck taxis. They're corrupt.   Edit2: I was a bit drunk when I wrote this. I know cabbies are just people trying to make a living but sometimes they do shady stuff and the cab companies do shady stuff.

California,3diz0w,sakebomb69,7,Fri Jul 17 01:21:30 2015 UTC,"Did you read the headline?  CPUC is fining Uber for violating civil rights legislation since Uber failed to prove they are in compliance. So the answer to your question is obviously yes.  The law is designed to force taxi companies to provide equal access to their service.  They are a publicly regulated business and they cannot discriminate.  If they get 10 calls from a bad area and 10 calls from a good area and they only respond to the calls from the good area, they will be fined.

The January 1st date is when they start keeping track of whether someone has finished the 90 day probationary period to be eligible.  The following page from the Department of Industrial Relations should clarify this and other questions about the law.
California,3dli5j,KAugsburger,4,Fri Jul 17 07:30:24 2015 UTC,After a 90 day probation period you earn 1 hour for every 30 hours you work. You must take at least 2 hours at a time. The time may be used as sick time or to take yourself or a family member to a medical appointment or to care for them if they are sick. You have to give at least 2 hours notice if you call in sick and you may be required to give more notice if it is a foreseeable absence like a doctors appointment.

How anyone could look at these numbers and declare that the loss is somehow the fault of the marijuana producing region of the state is mind boggling to me. Even if every single registered voter from the main marijuana-producing counties had voted yes, the measure still would have lost by several hundred thousand votes."
California,3dgksu,lamp37,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:00:44 2015 UTC,"Now, we could look at some other northern counties, but it's problematic because away from the coast, the northern counties are extremely conservative anyway (so the ""pot grower greed"" argument doesn't really fit)   Actually there is a skewed perception in most of this state that all of the MJ is grown in the 'emerald triangle' of humboldt, trinity and mendo. While those three counties do grow a LOT, MJ production is a major part of rural economies Siskiyou, Shasta, Tehama, Butte, Plumas, Sierra, Nevada, Placer, El Dorado, Amador, Calaveras, and Tuolemne counties as well."

And while marijuana plays a role in the economy all of these counties, to suggest that the majority of the people living in these counties (which are home to the cities of Chico, Redding, Placerville, Oroville, Roseville, Rocklin, and others) rely on the marijuana trade is completely false.

In 1986 President Ronald Regan signed the Immigration Reform Act but it didn't have any enforcement, so employers could still hire undocumented workers without penalty. In addition it granted amnesty to millions of undocumented workers and their families.    Make it much easier for Mexicans to come to the US to work legally.    I disagree. Mexico is the 15th largest economy in the world while Canada is the 11th, but you don't have the same economic disparity you find in Mexico. Mexico needs to reform its own policies that make it easier for Mexicans to stay at home to work. The only reason why US farmers for example hire undocumented is because its cheaper, low labor costs, lack of over site, no workman's comp, dangerous conditions, etc. US farms need to invest in more automation and less rely on human labor, because one day Mexicans will be able to work in their country, what will the US do then?   If you want guest workers they are entitled to the same protections as US citizens, like workman's comp, health insurance, etc. These guest workers should be able to switch jobs and look for better work. If you deny guest workers the same benefits as citizens then the only reason you are having guest workers its not because a labor shortage exists, you don't wish to pay real wages for the work.   Mexicans' are Catholic if you have a married couple of course they will have sex ( no protection) and will have children, who will be American citizens, who will use US schools, (health systems, etc)  this 10 year rule is not realistic.    Sealing the border   Building a tighter border is a waste of money and time. The problem isn't with immigrants, the problem is with Americans giving immigrants the incentives to work in the US by hiring them. Once we start putting Employers in jail for hiring undocumented workers then you see change, building security systems and paroling the border is waste of resources, when the problem is us, not them.

I agree, legal guest workers should have same worker protections as citizen workers.  I'm not suggesting we exploit Mexican workers, but doesn't mean we need to give them food stamps, housing aid, or other other welfare benefits.  I don't think anything in Constitution says if your kids are citizens, then you are a citizen. If parents have to go back to Mexico, then they can take their kids with them or leave them here with relatives.  Their kids would have dual citizenship.  Mexican gang members aren't getting jobs.  Neither are terrorists.  If we take away the incentive for Mexicans to cross the border illegally for jobs, it will make border agents job much easier and border security will improve without spending any more money. If border security was better we could simply deport Mexicans that are in our jails back to Mexico. But yes, we need tighter controls on employees that hire undocumented workers.

California,3dh3x7,Nvjds,4,Thu Jul 16 05:46:47 2015 UTC,"I've spent some time doing Whitney and Death Valley. You cannot see Death Valley from the peak of Whitney.   Climbing Whitney is a serious physical endeavor, requiring a lot of preparation. You can drive to the portal, but it's an 18 hour up and back of about 8k+ feet ascent. Not trivial. Camping requires a permit that takes about 6 months of planning. If you do not climb Whitney there are some wonderful mountains for viewing nearby, made famous in many of Westerns, named the Alabama hills. Highway 395 north or of Lone Pine is very dramatic and an enjoyable way to see the Eastern Sierras from a car   Inyo County is great, but California is large and there are other great places for mountains, such as the Sierras near Tahoe around the Carson Pass, which is much closer to your destination than Inyo.   Death Valley is a destination enjoyed from a car with working air conditioning. It's hot. Very hot. You will not spend much time here in the summer. Unless you're a lizard.   Morgan Hill is a suburb of San Jose, so roughly around the far southern tip of the Bay Area. It's about a 4+ hours drive to Tahoe and 8+ hours to Inyo County.   Enjoy California."
California,3dh3x7,ForgottenPassword3,2,Thu Jul 16 13:41:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks for answering! I thought it would be closer to Inyo but there are literally no roads that take you there, so you have to take this crazy loop to get to it. Its actually a quicker drive if you go from Morgan Hill to Yosemite and then go southeast!  Are the sierras and Tahoe very affected by the drought, or are they still nice to see? Same question applies to Yosemite.  Also, whats there to do in Alpine County? I found it strange that theres a county with 1,100 people in a state with over 38 million people."
California,3dh3x7,minor-catastrophe,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:34:42 2015 UTC,I was just at lake tahoe last week. The drought doesn't seem to have affected that area as much. Definitely would recommend going.
California,3dh3x7,shempmalone,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:10:24 2015 UTC,"You have the right ideas for cool scenery. Also accessible from the places you'll be are Pinnacles National Monument and Muir Woods (or Big Basin, if you can't get up there). If I had to make a choice between Big Sur and Yosemite, I'd take Yosemite.  Big Sur is very pretty and cool, but Yosemite is mind blowing.  Also, there is more to Yosemite than the valley - the alpine meadows are beautiful, and Mono Lake, which is on the Death Valley side of Yosemite, is super cool."
California,3dh3x7,211logos,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:24:04 2015 UTC,"Whitney requires a permit for hiking in any case, and they are probably booked up.  And yes, you have to go around the Sierra. Big mountains, those. South through Bakersfield and north up 395 is HOT. More pleasant to go through 120 (Yosemite Nat'l Park, but NOT Yosemite Valley), or 108 (about the same time).  Coming in from the north on 108 or 120 means you're higher, so cooler. Staying near Mammoth is nice; it's got a lot of facilities and is 7000' (but Mono County). Going south from there is going downhill; by the time you hit Bishop it's about 3600'. But dry. Those towns (Bishop, Independence, Big Pine, Lone Pine) are pretty small, but nice enough. You can do all sorts of hikes that aren't Mt. Whitney from there, but that get you high up. Try Rock Creek for instance; trailhead is about 10k.  From there you could drive towards Death Valley, but it's dangerous hot out there. Really. With few places to stay. But doable. A nice hike there is Telescope Peak, which has arguably the best view in CA, maybe better than Whitney (I think so). It's over 11k, and has camping not far below that so it's relatively cool. An easier hike is Wildrose Peak, also with good views.  Bottom line, 108, 120 and 395 are AWESOME drives. Well worth doing even if you cruise around in the car a lot. Perfect road trip.  If you go north more towards Tahoe, it gets crowded. Plus Alpine County was just the site of a big fire, so lots of areas may be closed off. It's got nice fishing, rafting on the East Carson River (with a hot spring halfway down), and a hot spring at Grover Hot Springs. Nice camping, if it all didn't burn up. Markleeville is a very small town, but has a nice bar.  In general, the western side of the Sierra is kinda dull compared to the eastern side, for two reasons: first, it's more forested, with long deep canyons, and second, because the east side is a much much steep escarpment; it's like a long gradual climb on the west, and a very very short steep one on the east.  Cruise Google streetview and you'll see."
California,3dh3x7,lethalcheesecake,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:53:30 2015 UTC,"This post is written with the idea that you have decent experience with climbing and hiking.  If you don't, ignore it please.  You know your skill level and experience better than I do, but Death Valley isn't a great place for fucking around.  That said:  You can actually see both Badwater Basin and Mt. Whitney from Telescope Peak in the Death Valley Park.  That one doesn't need a permit for climbing, but it's still not for beginners.  There are two trails; take the easy one your first time because the second one is very tricky in places.  It's 7 miles up (and 7 back down again) and 3k' elevation gain.     Obviously, since it's up a mountain, you won't get the extreme heat for most of the hike that you get in the valley proper (although the change in temperature and elevation can throw you for a loop), but you do have to drive through some potentially toasty areas to get there.  It is also VERY arid.  If you do go there, make sure to do all the basic wilderness safety, like checking the weather, checking your gear, telling people where you're going and when you'll be back, etcetcetc.  Then make sure to prep for the drive out there.  Bring water for the hike, then make sure to bring extra for the drive, then bring even more water for the hike (minimum 1 gallon/person for the hike alone).  Bring radiator fluid/coolant.  Bring battery operated fans.  If your car starts to overheat, kill the air, point the vents out the windows, blast the heat and consider turning around and going back.  Drink water frequently. You may think I'm exaggerating, but it's not uncommon for temperatures to top 110° in the low areas this time of year, and there's a reason it's not named CuddlyFluffyValleyoftheHugs.   Do NOT go hiking through the lower elevations in the summer."
California,3dh3x7,lethalcheesecake,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:37:48 2015 UTC,"So basically, Death Valley isnt worth it unless youre viewing it from a distance, and/or during the winter. Its fine by me, I'd much rather climb Telescope Peak than hike while carrying gallons of water on my back lol."

But the Express oopsied with the ""Solution"" headline: it's like saying ""A Solution to War."" We are lightyears away from that.  Consider just the Colorado River Compact. Even though it was just one watershed fighting over that went to the Supreme Court and took decades to sort, and is still a mess.  And a Sacto judge has already slapped down the state's attempt to limit senior water rights. And SF is deliberately flouting that same imperative, citing its vested water rights. And that's a nest full of greens.  Given that water is more elemental to our survival than anything but air, we've got a long struggle ahead that's gonna take a lot of compromise on everyone's part. I have little hope that people will do so, however."
California,3ddsev,211logos,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:42:53 2015 UTC,"No, not really much compromise needed.  Lack of it actually.  Just use eminent domain and be done with it.  We have no problem using eminent domain to take over property to build a wal mart or a home depot.   But fuck the people if they need water.    Did you know water usage is a closely guarded secret in the state of California?  It is illegal for the state to release any information on how much water is being used by pretty much any entity smaller than a municipality.   Which then makes it impossible to figure out who is responsible user of water and who is not."
California,3ddqqx,gAlienLifeform,7,Wed Jul 15 13:55:43 2015 UTC,"Video evidence now makes it obvious that in general police are too quick to shoot in ambiguous situations.  Police in the US need to either get more courage or get a different job.  If a knife-wielding freak is rushing at a cop, then I do think shooting is warranted; but no more of this  ""I killed him because his hands moved towards his pocket"" bullshit.  That is leaning too far towards cold-blooded killing.  Police in this country ought to take training lessons from the police in the UK because in the US they seem to typically prefer the easy solution over the humane solution."

What people don't realize is that stops like this happen a bazillion times every day, with tweaked out assholes acting in far more threatening ways than this guy. 99.9% of the cops don't shoot. I've seen FAR more threatening scenarios where the guy actually DID have a gun, and the cops were able to defuse the situation. Happens all the time.  But then you get some cop who's either a coward or a bully (often they go together) and you get this asshat. And often these clowns are involved in more than one hinkey shooting.

Most municipal vehicle fleets have their own pressure washing equipment to keep the vehicles clean, so it's a little surprising seeing a cop car driving through a car wash. Who knows why."

California,3d733z,thebruns,8,Tue Jul 14 05:11:52 2015 UTC,"Major oil refiners are artificially hiking gasoline prices throughout California by charging branded gas stations an average of 30 cents a gallon more than what independent stations pay -- the biggest price gap in years, according to a consumer advocacy group.  But Consumer Watchdog said that oil refiners have wielded their leverage over branded gas stations -- which are contractually obligated to buy gasoline at whatever prices refiners set -- to inflate prices this month.  Independent stations, which tend to be smaller and in locations that are less convenient to travelers, purchase gasoline from the wholesale market instead of directly from refiners.  In the last two weeks, refiners in Los Angeles charged branded stations an average of 30 cents more per gallon than they did unbranded stations, according to Consumer Watchdog. The average premium over the last 16 years was three cents.  Until this month, the 30-cent gap has only occurred three times since 1999 and never for more than one week, according to the group.  “It’s basically like a grocer putting his hand on the scale because he owns it to drive up price,” said Consumer Watchdog President Jamie Court.  The price disparity could violate the federal Robinson-Patman anti-price-discrimination law as well as a 2013 agreement thata refining and marketing company Tesoro Corp. struck with California Atty. Gen. Kamala Harris before purchasing all of Arco’s Southern California stations from BP, according to Consumer Watchdog.  The group called for Harris to appoint an independent prosecutor to investigate the allegations.  http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-california-gas-prices-20150630-story.html"

All done on the backs of people who can't afford the changes.   I'm all for renewables and electric cars, hell, I own one.

I don't know the specifics, but a lot of oil refineries will keep enough stock to keep the price at a certain range for a few days to a week or so (even with oil price rises.) When something happens like a supplier isn't able to meet demands or that someone else outbids the oil company for the barrel of oil, prices usually end up going up in price (because of less oil being able to be bought for a cheap price.)  It is one reason why oil prices around the South are so cheap compared to the oils prices in the West and Hawaii. The South, especially Texas, have a lot of refineries in and around the gulf area that they constantly use without the gas tax and without relying on other places as much."

California,3d49lp,rushingkar,3,Mon Jul 13 21:28:14 2015 UTC,"Not if you're using a standard car wash soap or dish soap.  Standard car wash soaps aren't very toxic and are sufficiently diluted when washing your car.  It might be bad if you dumped an entire bottle of soap right onto the lawn, but even that would probably be fine.  If you're using harsh chemicals to clean the painted surfaces of your car, you're doing more harm than good.  You might want to move your car back onto the driveway before using harsh wheel cleaners, or similar products.  Your biggest risk is putting ruts in your slick wet grass from spinning your tires.  If you plan properly, this shouldn't be an issue.  Make sure your exit out of your lawn will be flat or down hill, and try to use your accelerator as little as possible.  Shouldn't be any damage to your lawn if you think ahead."

California,3d49lp,tpx187,8,Mon Jul 13 19:18:43 2015 UTC,"Diy car washes with the pressure washer and brush are actually the worst possible way people can wash their cars. The brushes are never cleaned and there's no telling what kind of shit the person before you was scraping off of their car with that brush.   Automatic car washes with the spinning brushes and stuff are bad for the same reason. The brushes are rarely cleaned so there's dirt and debris that gets pushed around on the car causing swirls.   Touchless car washes are okay, but because they are touchless, they have to work harder to remove dirt. As a result, very acidic soap is used that will damage the clear coat in the long run.   The best way to wash a car is with the proper two bucket method and materials or using a foam gun.   Source: I've been detailing cars since I was 15, professionally since I was 17."

If not, all the small farmers are going to go out of business and only megafarms are going to be left. lets start by making them pay a market rate and not getting subsidized water. if we want to subsidize why dont we subsidize water conservation practices and not have them continue to flood fields for crops that dont need flood irrigation im looking at you almond farmers"

California,3d49lp,Monster-Trucks,20,Mon Jul 13 20:06:53 2015 UTC,"I work on a farm/ranch that depends on well and spring water on our property. Last year we had to cut back on row crops about 25% and buy in hay from oregon instead of putting livestock on pasture. This year we actually had semi-decent rain fall in our watershed so we are doing much better. Since we draw water off our property we are not dependent on the runoff from snow pack like most of California. Everyone running off snow pack is fucked right now.  Lots of folks are getting put out of business or are scaling back so much that they have to take second jobs. Our ranch is very diversified and set up on drip irrigation so we aren't hurting as bad as others, we would be one of the last to close up. If this continues for a few more years more than half the farms will close."
California,3d49lp,misyo,4,Mon Jul 13 15:39:03 2015 UTC,"Would you say that some of these adaptations such as drip systems are long overdue? Have the restrictions and subsequent adaptations created any positive outcomes, such as efficiency?"
California,3d49lp,Monster-Trucks,8,Mon Jul 13 19:20:44 2015 UTC,"The initial cost of converting to drip irrigation for a farm is enormous. If a farm closes due to the drought that means they couldn't afford drip, not that they don't want to be efficient. For the big farms its cheaper to buy a lobbyist than it is to switch to drip so thats what they do.  I haven't seen any positives for farming yet because its all the small guys who are losing out. The big guys are still out there flooding fields to grow rice.   Stop buying california grown rice, sweet corn, and grain fed beef. The amount of groundwater being pumped would plummet."

California,3d49lp,Monster-Trucks,5,Mon Jul 13 19:10:59 2015 UTC,Our ranch is a few thousand acres but we only use a few hundred of them and we are at the top of the watershed. We are obsessive about our groundwater and have gone to some pretty extreme lengths. I can't speak for other people's water use in our area but we are definitely much better off than most regions right now.  Our ranch is a net 98% water returner. That means that of all of the rain that falls in an average year we only draw the equivalent of 2% from our wells. I don't know of anyone who can beat that.

California,3d49lp,weaselword,51,Tue Jul 14 01:03:59 2015 UTC,"From my perspective, the prolonged drought is having a positive influence.  A lot of home-owners have switched their landscaping to drought-resistant plants, or even rock gardens.  This wouldn't have happened if the drought lasted only a year, because then people wouldn't see the value of investing the time and effort.  Also, in the area where I live (Orange County), a lot of neighborhoods have Home Owner's Associations (HOA), which used to demand, e.g., that each house has a lawn, and that it be green.  Now they can't do that, so if one wants to have an aesthetic landscape more suitable to the local climate, one can.  Of course, all this doesn't really address California's water issues.  Roughly: 80% of water is used for agriculture, and the rest are split almost evenly between industrial use, residential indoor use, and residential outdoor use.  The recent water reduction efforts by water districts to reduce water use by 25% do not apply to agriculture, so at best they would reduce the overall water use by 5%.  Which is very mild.    For example, in my water district, the restriction is for each person to average 60 gallons a day, over the course of a month.  And that doesn't include landscaping, which is counted separately (and also has some restrictions).  For me, 60 gallons a day is about twice as much as I usually use."
California,3d49lp,gehzumteufel,17,Mon Jul 13 14:38:52 2015 UTC,The not affecting ag use is bullshit. Look at all the farms that have shrunk as a result of the drought and water restrictions.

I know the argument of im just one person doesn't hold up because what if everyone else thinks that way too. I view it as the same as voting, as infuriating as that might make you. Anyways we are only responsible for 20% of water as rest is agricultural, so even if we save a lot it still isn't going to make a good dent. Even then im sure whatever percent we save will go to agriculture.  Speaking of that, there are almond orchards going up everywhere. They're building them because they're making a killing exporting to China. Its different when its normal produce that we eat day to day like corn, etc. But the almond orchards are for their profit, its not to provide sustenance and it requires an enormous amount of water.  So, while we are killing out lawns and degrading our quality of lives, these farmers are using all the water to send off almonds to china and make a lot of money."
California,3d49lp,FishyH2os,11,Tue Jul 14 01:04:32 2015 UTC,"In Merced County their are homes with no more running water. Dried wells. No showers, no water for dishes. I have family down their that are about to just walk away from their home. Rumours of farmers have been buying stolen water or just steeling it. Up north in Humboldt county though it doesn't seem to be affecting us as bad. We had a major river that just stopped running for a little bit. Its bad for the salmon and steelhead that have to make it up stream in the fall. Green algae is growing in the rivers and that kills the fish."
California,3d49lp,CritFailingLife,10,Mon Jul 13 18:13:28 2015 UTC,"Depends on who you are. We're all supposed to be conserving water and in my area they just put fines in place for anyone using over the target reduction amount (looking for a 30% reduction from our 2013 use). No hosing down sidewalks, you'll get in trouble if there's runoff from your sprinklers, only watering certain days and only during low evaporation hours.   There's always the asshole neighbor who doesn't bother conserving at all. One of mine ripped out their perfectly attractive yard and completely re-sodded everything (who the fuck does that during a drought?) and has been watering like crazy and washing their cars with hose water in the driveway (rather than going somewhere they use reclaimed water or getting it done with only a bucket or two).   There are other people who take it to the extreme and go perhaps a bit overboard with it.   Most people are somewhere in the middle. In my house, we're careful to not waste water. We stopped watering the lawn at the first sign of drought. Worse, we stopped watering the blackberry bushes (which means all traditional family berry picking and berry ice cream making and baking aren't happening this summer and only barely happened last summer since we were already conserving). Without flooding them every couple days, all they produce are shriveled little wild berries instead of big, juicy, lush berries. We aren't flushing pee until there are two or three lady pees (with toilet paper since piling it up could clog the toilet and it works to roughly keep timing even and an amount that doesn't make the place smell like pee). We make sure washer and dishwasher loads are full. We just bought a new HE washing machine and are getting a combined $150 rebate from the water company and electric company (it's $50 from one, $100 from the other, but I don't remember which). We try to avoid wasting water by doing things like filling the dogs' water bowls with the water that comes out while we wait for the shower water to warm up. I don't take shorter showers because my showers are a large part of how I keep myself sane and I'm not willing to give up that routine/ritual, but I do wash my hair less often (very long hair, so washing and conditioning it means a decent extra chunk of time in the shower)."

I also have a beautiful bougainvillea and multiple mature queen palms that I basically never water, only if we have a few 100+ degree days, which is maybe twice a year.  All are very green and lush.

Make sure the dishwasher is packed before we run it.  Rarely wash the car anymore.  The backyard has not one blade of grass left.  We catch water in both showers via buckets as the water runs to get hot enough and in the kitchen sink with a dish pan and use it for watering the flowers/plants and the plum tree.  We don't fill a glass all the way up or throw any excess water/coffee/tea/milk/any liquid down the drain.  If we have leftover pasta water or water used to steam veggies we let it cool and water the plants.

California,3d49lp,Angeeclectic,3,Tue Jul 14 03:54:03 2015 UTC,"Living in agricultural Ventura County, it definitely has. We're considering ripping out our avocado trees. All our neighbors are making the same considerations.  Most people shouldn't be affected much, especially if they've gone out of the way to put in efficient appliances and most importantly, ripped out their lawn. But California will be affected--it's projected to have a 1 billion dollar revenue loss and thousands of jobs lost. That will no doubt have somewhat of a ripple effect.  The silver lining is that everyone is more conscious of their water usage and has decreased their usage dramatically (save for a few problem counties)."

Their wells went dry and then they paid to drill deeper and got only mud. So they cut the trees.    Some pulled them out.  Others are leaving the stumps.  They can go dormant and come back when water comes. But they don't bear again for a few years.   The groves cut look so sad.

If people stopped driving so much and the overall gallons sold dropped noticeably, then the prices would come down (somewhat).  Last time, that didn't happen until we were close to (and in a few cases over) $5/gallon.

People will pay a lot more for gas without thinking about it because its so useful and does so much work for us. Expect gasoline to be much more expensive in the future, the supply is only diminishing while demand is still going up worldwide. That means higher prices for everybody."

I've lived in Los Angeles while underemployed and lived paycheck to paycheck while driving a fuel inefficient vehicle that I owned outright.

My office is by the 5 and there's a station right next to the on-ramp that's $1-$1.20 more expensive than literally every station in the area.

Since when did being middle-class entail renting out your rooms to people? Since when did being middle-class entail staying at a stranger's home? There's no shortage of real estate for hotels. Not trying to bash AirBnb--it certainly has a place for many people--but I'll pay extra for a hotel knowing 1. someone has a job and 2. i'm not promoting someone giving up their privacy so i can crash at their house

If some person stuck with such a job decides to make rent by allowing you to stay via AirBnB at her place for a week or two, why so bad?  And I've seen middle class people rent out space since before the personal computer was invented. Done it myself. And staying at stranger's homes. Ever been to a guest house? boarding house? even some hostels? I've stayed in tons of owner or renter occupied housing while on the road, long before AirBnB was a thing."

California,3d1i1n,Greenerguns,3,Sun Jul 12 20:05:46 2015 UTC,"Andrew Molera is a nice park- it has a beach and a beautiful 8 mile loop hike that takes you from bluffs to old growth oak and redwood groves. It's really beautiful. Also has access to a cove with pink sand.   As far as the best, I don't know. If you want more of the Big Sur setting, try Pfeiffer. It's massive but you can camp in huge redwood groves that are incredible.   Or- another gem is Limekiln. Little farther south then both of those parks, it's kind of out of Big Sur proper, but the campsites are beautiful. There a couple that are under redwoods, backed up to a stream that empties out into a small cove/beach. Unlike Pfieffer, the campsites are at sea level, so you can walk from the shade of redwoods to the water. Also a couple cool hikes, not as cool as the Andrew Molera one.. That thing is incredible."

The harsher part of the drive was driving through Los Padres National Forest. I was nauseous from all those curves. When you do finally pass it there are several hiking paths that you can just pull over and check out. There were plenty of stopped cars and people walking around that it won't be hard to miss. Moro Bay is a nice little town that is definitely worth the visit. It has a huge rock in the middle of the ocean that is beautiful and there is plenty to check out around town. They even have a small aquarium with seals. Further south the beach city of Carpinteria has great beaches along with the cities surrounding it like Santa Barbara and Ventura. Warning, there was a recent oil spill in the Santa Barbara area and I myself have not seen what the effects have been. Santa Monica and Venice are iconic beach cities in So Cal, so it's worth the stop. Feel free to pm me with questions."

California,3cwpel,ktreektree,6,Sat Jul 11 18:59:09 2015 UTC,"This seems like a slightly misplaced study. If I understand correctly, one of the reasons that coastal redwoods grow only near the coast is that they get much of their water through fog condensation collected on the foliage of the tree.   See this article: https://baynature.org/articles/fog-and-redwoods-demystifying-the-mist/  The lack of rain in California is something wholly different from the amount of fog.  Perhaps the study will show that the drought has less impact on the redwoods. I suppose that would be an interesting finding."
California,3cwpel,califoregon,7,Sat Jul 11 16:24:30 2015 UTC,"I don't have a link but I recall seeing a study that said San Francisco has been getting 75% fewer foggy days lately. How will that affect the redwoods?  EDIT: I'm unable to find any such study, I may have recalled it in error. There is a study saying San Francisco had 33% less summertime fog from 2010, which is significantly better than what I recalled."
California,3cwpel,tlalexander,2,Sat Jul 11 18:08:18 2015 UTC,There are relatively few redwoods in San Francisco. The larger groves and forests are outside of the city - in fact the sites being studied in this project are over an hour's drive from SF.
California,3cwpel,AvatusKingsman,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:01:08 2015 UTC,"I understand that, but if the fog is being reduced by 75% it is likely that nearby areas have received a similar reduction. Obviously that may not be true, but my point was that it is reasonable to be concerned about redwood trees due to the reduction in both rain and fog that the area has received."
California,3cwpel,tlalexander,2,Sat Jul 11 23:24:42 2015 UTC,"I live in the redwoods of Santa Cruz. The fog has been the same as always, definitely not a 75% drop. Last few weeks I've been waking up to wet, soggy ground from how heavy the fog has been.  And this is July! The fog doesn't even get serious until mid-August."
California,3cwpel,McCheesySauce,5,Sun Jul 12 21:32:18 2015 UTC,"This seems like a waste of money, some trees are 300 years old. Is this the first drought they have been through?"
California,3cwpel,egrone209,8,Sat Jul 11 15:13:23 2015 UTC,"Some trees are 300 years old? Some are 2000 years old. This may not be the first draught and I have no doubt that they could survive a long period of temporary drought, but this drought may not be temporary. How will the trees respond to a sustained reduction in rain and fog in the area they evolved to live in? They are used to a particular climate and that climate is changing. Not just a temporary fluctuation which they definitely would have evolved to handle but a permanent reduction of rainfall and fog (redwoods get a significant portion of their moisture from fog, which has now been reduced by 75% in much of their habitat). How will they handle it? Will they all die?  When Americans came to California we cut down 90% of the redwood trees for lumber. We cut down 2000 year old giants to build homes and railroads. Will the machine of our industry now wipe out the last 10% of California's great native forests?  I think some research into the subject would be well worth our time and money. Currently, we have no idea what will happen. Don't you think someone should know?"
California,3cwpel,tlalexander,5,Sat Jul 11 18:06:31 2015 UTC,I read yesterday that there are going to be heavy rains this coming winter and spring due to El Nino warming the oceans waters.       Hopefully the trees will survive the drought before then.  http://www.mercurynews.com/drought/ci_28458401/california-drought-el-nino-weather-event-is-biggest
California,3cwpel,Ghitit,2,Sat Jul 11 19:10:55 2015 UTC,"The trees will not die before this coming winter, but most research predicts that draughts will get more extreme in the coming decades due to human-induced climate change. Learning how our forests respond to a semi-major draught can help us understand how to predict what will happen in cases of extreme draught.  For example, if they were to find that losing the redwoods was unavoidable in cases of extreme draught, it might change public opinion about carbon emission even sooner. Even if we couldn't save the redwoods, we could potentially save thousands of other species of plants and animals by doing this research.  Climate change is not a short term problem whose effects will be eliminated by a little or even a lot of rainy weather. The problems caused by CO2 emissions take roughly 20 years to manifest, so what we're seeing now is only from our emissions into the 1990's. We increased emissions year over year since then and we continue to do that. That means what comes in the future will definitely be worse.  The important thing to understand, for planning purposes, is how much worse. That's what research like this is for.  If we're lucky, we'll just discover that the redwoods will be fine. Evolution has given them any tricks, and they may be more resilient than we think. But they still have a breaking point, and we should find out what that point is."
California,3cwpel,tlalexander,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:42:44 2015 UTC,"Agreed...  Further, what good would it do. We have no tech to alter weather. Sure, cloud seeding, but that is barely conclusive and cannot create rain clouds from nothing."

California,3cz77m,ferae_naturae,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:55:51 2015 UTC,"This is exactly the wrong approach. The reason is simple, and it is called Darwin.  When lots of coyotes (tens of thousands or more) get to be killed by humans every year, in a species that ""exhibit strong compensatory responses to lethal control."" - http://www.projectcoyote.org/newsreleases/news_predatorinperil.html - it is to be expected for coyotes to became better adapted in the conflict with humans. That can mean that we might put selection pressure that makes the coyotes smarter, and better adapted to the human threat. (OK, NOW I AM SPECULATING).  The right way is to first isolate wild animals from our homes.  How about fences?  How about we take away Home Owner Associations the right to stop people from having fences?   How about we use the surveillance technology that we build to monitor wild life around our cities?  (OK, NOW I SPREAD FUD)."

Unfortunately, that's ignored all up and down the state with the exception of a few counties, like Contra Costa. It requires vigilence, but meanwhile the state has been cutting back on legal representation for kids (these lawyers should have been insisting on better oversight of the process, where have THEY been?), counties are cutting social workers, and the compensation for taking in foster kids has been pathetic for years, especially for kids with psych problems.

A couple general observations.  The overwhelming majority of the students that got new competitive grants were community college students.(Table 3B)  Over 6,000 had GPAs below 3.0.(Table 5)    Most are 25 or over.(Table 10)  The major factor appears to be income.  No independent student got a competitive Cal Grant with an income over 48K and it was rare for those with incomes above 36K(less than 2,000).(Table 9)"
California,3cxlt5,bsou1,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:30:21 2015 UTC,"I exaggerate a bit, but look at the scoring criteria,  and you'll see why it's not that big of a exaggeration.   GPA is probably the least important part of it because chances are people with an amazing GPA went straight to college and possibly qualified for an entitlement grant. Income is also probably one of the least important factors because most applicants are low income. Here's the description of the 200 point system, and here's the actual scoring sheet . According to the the cal grant report to the legislature , the cutoff for last year was 165 points to get a grant.  Assuming you had a typical 3.0 GPA, you're single/independent, and are in the lowest income bracket, that gets you 120 points. (50 points for gpa and 70 points for low income) You still need 45 more points.   You get 0 points for each college graduate parents, 5 points for each high school graduate parent, and 9 points for each high school dropout parent.  Lets assume you have two high school graduate parents, now you have 130 points.  You get zero points for married parents, and 18 points for divorced parents. Assuming, you have divorced parents, that's 148 points.  Now there's something called access qualifier. You get  can 18 points if you were homeschooled and submitted a GED score instead. Or can also get up to 18 points if you were away from high school for 8 years or more and have zero college. (less points for less time away ) Let's say I've been away for 8 years, that's 166 points. Just barely made it!  I didn't have divorced parents though, so I never had a chance.   Here's the typical qualifying person who didn't get a grant according to the report.   The typical eligible non-awardee in 2012-13 was 27 years old with a GPA of 2.89 and was from a family of 3 with an income of $20,861   When competitive cal grants were first introduced, you had a 1 in 4 chance of getting one. But since the amount of grants (22,500) stayed the same for around 15 years, I think the odds now are like 6%."

Kingsburg is a safe little town that still maintains the small town vibe. They have some interesting events throughout the year (Swedish Festival, there's a car show), Common Grounds (best coffee without resorting to Starbucks or Fresno), and they have some museums. Plus, they are really into their Swedish heritage, which makes it fun. Bullfrogs is right off 99 on 384 if you want to check out a country western bar...even though if it's not Friday, it may as well be a mariachi bar.   Reedley, as someone already mentioned, is alright. I grew up there; there's a ton of fruit trees, there's the Blossom Trail in the spring (I believe they do a big bike ride?), and there's the Opera House (I believe they're doing West Side Story now/soon), there's the Fiesta (I think that happened already), and there's a Farmers Market downtown on Wedsnesdays(?). The Reedley Museum is really nice too; it's super small, but it offers a really interesting view into the town's history. Plus, the people who run it are super dedicated to it (they're all adorable old people too!). The MCC store is really cool too; they offer quilting classes, have a coffee shop, and have all sorts of neat stuff from around the world. However, everything shuts down at like...5pm.   Visalia would be worth checking out too - there's the Rawhides (minor league baseball team), the downtown is adorable and has some good eats, I think there's a couple of theaters, etc. It's really peaceful and for a bigger city, it feels very safe and you're not as likely to get shit stolen off your car like you would in Fresno.

I have a feeling his policies will have no observational climate improvement (to what specific level, nobody seems acutely aware) yet will burden lower classes with higher taxes and technology with a lower efficacy than fossil fuels. All because of this foolish conflating of science and the socialist greater good."
California,3csp1r,ShamAbram,5,Fri Jul 10 16:51:59 2015 UTC,"I agree that there is a significant disconnect between the actual results of science and the policies drafted in government, on both ends. For instance, a politician cannot claim with sincerity they want to fight climate change on one hand, and reject one of the most powerful tools for fighting it (nuclear) on the other.   Science has shown that, statistically speaking, nuclear power is safe -- every single accident has been due to human error in large part. There are tested reactor designs that are literally incapable of melting down, by the very laws of physics, yet we still rely on reactors that boil water like a steam locomotive from 1880.  But I digress. The point is, the rejection of nuclear science by the left-environmentalist wing of politics has led to an adoption of less-efficient renewable technology (and even the rise of greenwashing burning wood as a renewable technology, again in contradiction to the results of science), as a method of combating global warming.  Add to that the denial of science (global warming) from the right wing of politics, the refusal to put an end to subsidies of the most polluting energy source (coal) we have, and a stubborn refusal to embrace nuclear as a solution to our energy needs (even if it's not as demonized as on the left) and we have a political deadlock where the only thing we can do is keep burning fossil fuels because nobody is willing to agree on anything."

California,3cozde,BeatnikThespian,4,Fri Jul 10 03:48:39 2015 UTC,Pretty much since r/california began being brigaded by a bunch of the white power and racist subs. Fucking irritating.
California,3cozde,cuteman,-4,Fri Jul 10 00:33:07 2015 UTC,"Er.... If you say so. Based on what? Your intuition?   The majority of your comments recently all seem to vilify the ""racists"" on reddit and then assert, based on your assumptions that they're brigading all the subs you're commenting on.   Are you going to call me a racist for questioning your totally evidence and fact based witch hunt?"
California,3cozde,BeatnikThespian,3,Fri Jul 10 14:42:45 2015 UTC,"If you look at where I'm posting those, it's all in this sub to people wondering why they're being downvoted to all hell for not expressing right-wing bullshit. I'm not going to bother looking up the post someone made about the brigading a little while ago because I'm on mobile, but I'm sure you can probably find it by searching.  You can frame this however you want, but the far-right tone that's appeared in the comments section over the last few months really speaks for itself. I'm not interested in dealing with it and the people who are confused about why they're suddenly surrounded by bigots should know."

I'd rather not be stuck on a long flight with either, but I'd choose the overly-enthusiastic activist over some dude brewing in years of hate.  I'm honestly a lot more laid back than those harsher posts might make me seem. I just have a very low tolerance for prejudice. It's antiquated, doesn't have a place in the world, and people who still cling to it need to hear that they're out of touch with reality.  Side note: I don't get ""social justice warriors"" as an insult. Keyboard crusader or slacktivist, sure, but social justice is a damn good cause. I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt and assuming you're just kinda using it because it's a meme now. It says a lot about a person though when they think calling someone an advocate for civil rights is an insult. Something to think about."

California,3cozde,Handsomejack94,48,Fri Jul 10 07:40:11 2015 UTC,I mean thats what minority really means right? It's never been about numbers. There are a lot of places in the south where blacks outnumber whites- numbers have never been the problem. The problem was and is systemic economic and legal discrimination and for many people those problems remain as deeply entrenched as they have for years.

Many minorities hate being talked to in that tone of voice also.  I mean, if you're not interested in success, keep it up.

Oil prices go down by 50% and they increase exports and shut down capacity to keep prices high. And I would bet you that their argument for the price hike will be somehow related to the cap and trade efforts put forth by the state which didn't raise prices more than 10 cents if I remember correctly.

California,3cpmtt,looingforward,5,Thu Jul 9 19:39:33 2015 UTC,L.A. - go to Disneyland. It's the best theme park in America and impossible not to enjoy. Also check out Santa Monica/Venice Boardwalk. You'll probably need a car.   Las Vegas - get a hotel on or very near the strip. Play penny slots in the casinos for free cocktails (tip your server). Walk up and down the strip and absorb the weirdness. DO NOT bring hookers back to your room.   San Francisco - go to Fishermans Wharf. If you go to Golden Gate Bridge there is an 80% chance it will too foggy to see. Wander golden gate park (it's huge). Talk to people in areas that look interesting and ask them what to do ( we are friendly).   Have fun and take pictures.
California,3cpmtt,KNBeaArthur,4,Thu Jul 9 23:27:58 2015 UTC,"San Francisco:  Fisherman's Wharf is a total tourist trap - only go if you know exactly why you're going, i.e. to get In n Out, clam chowder, or see the Sea Lions. Do not go there to do shopping. Do not go there expecting history or culture.  The Golden Gate Bridge is an architectural marvel and still amazing to see even when it's foggy, which in August it usually isn't, as long as you're there in the early afternoon and not early morning or late afternoon. Go to the top of Hawk Hill if it's sunny, or if the fog sits low over the bay. It's just across the bridge. You will not regret it.  Put on good walking shoes and walk around the Northeast part of town. Best walking is in North Beach, Union Square, Chinatown, Nob Hill, Jackson Square, Embarcadero, the Mission, Castro, etc..."

The last couple El Nino predictions have kind of fizzled out, so people are skeptical.  However, this one seems very legit and promising.      If it's anything like 97/98 it will put a significant dent in the drought.  For example, Santa Barbara received 21.74” of precipitation in February 1998 alone (that's more than they get in a normal entire year).  If this does materialize, hopefully the rainfall is little more spread out.  The rains didn't really start until February of that 97/98 rainy season and then it came incessantly."

Bad in that it will cause massive mudslides and flooding which will be made worst because of all of the dead trees from the drought.  And it won't restore our snowpack which is what we normally depend on for water throughout the summer.  Definitely better than another year of drought.

For the tl;dr crowd, here's a quote:   the impacts of the warm water off the coast in conjunction with El Nino are not certain.  The last 2 strong El Ninos had the warm water non-existent or further South.  That adds to my apprehensions about the El Nino from the last post, that it is still too early to know if it will stay strong through the 15-16 Winter.  The CPC has upped the chances of El Nino conditions through the Winter to 85%, but that is not for a strong El Nino just any El Nino.  The forecast models have predicted El Nino the last 2 Summers and it didn't happen.  The difference this Summer is that we already have strong conditions.   http://opensnow.com/dailysnow/tahoe/post/4111"

A farmer who is forced to stop growing because they have to cut their water is out of a job, the state loses tax money, and potentially whole communities are affected.    I mean, if we wanted to get serious we could do things like end beef production, rice growing, almond growing, and a whole bunch of agricultural things, but I don't know if that's in the long term interest of the state.  Those industries aren't really things that can start and stop at the drop of the hat without having major long-term repercussions."

An interpreter will be provided for those who need it and the interpreter swears under penalty of perjury.  The attending physician has to offer a chance for the patient to withdraw.  Coercing someone to sign the declaration, forging the declaration, or concealing or destroying a rescission of the end of life declaration is a felony.   I'd say reasonable care has been made via this bill to avoid any slippery slope and the other four states with right to die laws seem to be doing fine.

The fire danger is either 'very high' or 'high' in Angeles National Forest (depending on whether you look at the front page, or directly at the fire conditions page), which is not unusual for this time of year. Campfires aren't even prohibited right now. Where it is higher, it is because of the drought, which may be influenced to an unknown degree by global warming, but droughts are also not unusual to California anyway so it's an influence ""by degrees"".

California,3cauw8,1GoodDad,24,Mon Jul 6 13:47:18 2015 UTC,"So what is the solution? The article describes the problem, but barely touches on the causes let alone any possible solutions to the issue.  I would like to see a more aggressive policy towards simply housing the homeless first and working on their issues there after. If the goal is to integrate these people back into society, and back into the workforce if they are able, then housing should be a priority (and possible a more efficient way to spend if it offsets expenses to the health and justice systems). Integration without a stable place to live makes that goal seem far fetched."
California,3cauw8,le_Dandy_Boatswain,15,Mon Jul 6 18:45:47 2015 UTC,THIS.  I agree. We find homeless animals and rush them to a shelter. Homeless humans?  We consider them pests.  I hope that that thinking can be changed.

California,3cauw8,Akamaru,11,Wed Jul 8 16:43:09 2015 UTC,"I live in San Luis Obispo. We had one guy who offered his land to the homeless and devised a commune with some RV's and barns and stuff.  Of course, his act of altruism had to be shit canned because the county demands a monopoly on charitable organizations. He was promptly arrested and our homeless problem has never been greater. It's stories like his that make me resent our local government and feel it runs as a venal plutocratic playground for Cal Poly higher ups and untouchable political figures.   New York Times did a story about him: http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/12/us/12homeless.html?_r=0  Makes me angry to see our community actively hindering any alms for the poor that doesn't have support from the government."
California,3cauw8,ShamAbram,20,Mon Jul 6 19:17:56 2015 UTC,"The problem on this one was there was no proper waste accommodations (i.e. human waste disposal and hygiene necessities.) I noticed the article mentions nothing of that.  [Edit] Also was a building was in seriously bad shape.  I think this is more of the way to go: http://www.fourlightshouses.com/pages/the-napoleon-complex   Small houses, shared facilities, strict rules. People can donate for a ""mini house"" instead of just giving them cash on the side of the road. Could crowd fund small houses for homeless people. If you don't like the rules take your ""house"" and get the hell out, lol."

It also points out that the county tried to work with him to bring it up to code, but he refused.   I think his intentions were good, but the story isn't as one sided as OP makes it out to be."
California,3cauw8,le_Dandy_Boatswain,2,Mon Jul 6 19:33:47 2015 UTC,"That's true. But is it any worse than the areas near San Diego or the border? The New River is allowed to be as unhygienic as possible with government oversight, but not the homeless gypsy commune in the Central Coast.   There's just this double standard wherein the individuals are arrested for trying to help people out and the public sector is allowed to observe health code violations without fear of liability."
California,3cauw8,ShamAbram,9,Mon Jul 6 19:33:56 2015 UTC,One being in violation does not excuse the other for being in violation. Simple septic systems in place can negate the human waste problem. Other places simply pay for porta-potties to avoid the issue.  So just because a business contaminates a water source still does not make it okay for a commune to do it.   Both need to be corrected.
California,3cauw8,hostile65,2,Mon Jul 6 19:38:07 2015 UTC,"I'll agree with that. Both should be held accountable for improper waste management, cases of Hep C, that kind of thing.

California,3cauw8,ShamAbram,7,Mon Jul 6 20:23:37 2015 UTC,"""the county demands a monopoly on charitable organizations"" is a complete bullshit reading of the situation.  This isn't Delhi or the ""informal housing"" of Johannesburg or a Palestine refugee camp.  He was arrested for flagrant violations of the building code, which created a public safety disaster.    What more:   County and city officials say they have tried to help Mr. de Vaul bring his operation into code compliance, offering to waive fees, haul off junk and even bring architects to the site.  “We really felt the county was bending over backward to have Dan be able to house homeless people,” said Dee Torres, the homeless-services director for the county’s low-income service agency. “And Dan would not give a centimeter.”   He probably didn't even have zoning for the site and the county still wanted to work with him."
California,3cauw8,combuchan,3,Mon Jul 6 21:05:57 2015 UTC,"County and city officials say many things, while the homeless shoot up in the assistance motels and the creekside unabated. To the government, this is simply out of their hands while de Vaul was attempting, rather unsuccessfully, the job the local government was also failing miserably at.  I guess when it comes to gross incompetence in the face of mass numbers of homeless, it's better to be horribly inefficient and in spec than naively optimistic and with violations."

Aaand this is where you know they're being dishonest, intellectually and factually.   Factually: It was planned to store up to 15 million acre-feet of water, not 50 MAF.   Intellectually: San Francisco is a small and relatively low-water-use area. 15 MAF would be a huge increase to the state's water storage (a 37% increase), but it's only 1.5 years of urban water usage state-wide. Picking a relatively small municipality to pull a years-of-water number is extremely misleading.

California,3c91gz,adizzyyo,5,Mon Jul 6 07:17:19 2015 UTC,"During the first year of the exam freshman were invited to take the test, and it was incredibly easy. The test was not a very good gauge of what a high school graduate was supposed to know."
California,3c91gz,yajed,2,Mon Jul 6 03:56:44 2015 UTC,"I passed it my Freshman year... If you can't pass the HS exit exam, you should not have a diploma."
California,3c91gz,yourparadigm,8,Mon Jul 6 22:02:04 2015 UTC,How much 'dumber down' can it get? It isn't fair to the students to send them out without skills.
California,3c91gz,WiseChoices,3,Mon Jul 6 03:57:38 2015 UTC,"I believe the problem they're addressing is that standardized testing fails massively at measuring the ""skills"" students leave high school with. There are plenty of reports on this, if you'd care to read them.   The first part of the issue is that students (and teachers) only learn how to remember answers for a test, instead of developing critical thinking skills on dynamic, real world scenarios.  The second part is that people aren't standardized, so the tests have to be so broad/dumbed down to uselessness, or the tests fail the people that simply aren't wired to understand math, for example, but if they're an extraordinary writer they just get a ""pass."" The major issue with this, being that the stated example means that person could be held back or fail because of their weak subject."
California,3c91gz,polartechie,2,Mon Jul 6 17:13:36 2015 UTC,"I did hear some students discussing this. It was pretty appalling. I mean, they weren't rocket scientists or anything, and they thought the test was a joke. One said that they could have passed it in eighth grade.  I think I agree with you. It seems to be ineffective. It was a good idea, but needs work."
California,3c91gz,WiseChoices,3,Mon Jul 6 17:17:44 2015 UTC,"I'm very in favor of getting rid of it, but for different reasons than most.  My older brother is a quadriplegic, meaning he can't use his arms or legs, but his mind is still perfectly fine, and he can speak.  He was always in the normal classes from 3rd grade until senior year in high school.  He had an aide that took him to class and did his school work including tests with him, they would read him the question and he would tell them the answer.  This worked perfectly in all of his normal classes, but the CAHSEE was different.  The rules were very strict that students are not allowed to have outside help of any sort, so my brother was forced to sit in the testing room without his aide, unable to do anything for the testing period.  I am not sure, but I think he may have had to do it multiple times, since you are supposed to retake the test if you fail it the first time.  My parents eventually got the school board to agree to let him graduate without having passed the test, but it was frustrating for my parents and I'm sure it was humiliating for my brother.  PS: all this information came from my mother, I've never actually talked to my brother about it."
California,3c91gz,legomerf27,4,Mon Jul 6 07:11:59 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry you're brother has to go through life in that condition, but you have to see that he is such a small minority factor for the testing. How about instead of getting rid of it, they add in that someone with disabilities like that can have assistance?"
California,3c91gz,Creature_73L,7,Mon Jul 6 08:16:04 2015 UTC,"You know, I'm pretty sure that would violate federal law.   Every single standardized test I've taken as an adult has bent over backwards for exemptions for the less than abled."

California,3c91gz,Spore2012,7,Mon Jul 6 05:51:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the CA High School Proficiency Exam is just that - a proficiency exam for kids who want to get out of high school early.  I passed it when I was 16, the hardest question on it required a little bit of trig that you'll likely go over in Geometry.  Got to skip half my junior and all of my senior year.  Similar to the GED, except you have to be 18 or over to take the GED, the CHSPE is for under-18s.  This exam is an exit exam, something all senior-year students have to pass to get their diploma - a test they take as they ""exit"" high school, different from the CHSPE."

So many amazing breweries are practically down the street from my office, mainly Ballast Point, AleSmith, Port, and OF COURSE Stone! My two liter growler gets a workout.

My family and I were driving to a family reunion in Utah, when we passed a sign saying we were near Golden Spike, which is the place where they connected the Transcontinental Railroad back in the 19th century.  So we were like ""Hey, there's a museum there. Let's go check out it!"" And we did. But on the way, we ran across something unusual. There were dozens, no hundreds of cars parked on the side of the little 2-line road leading to Golden Spike. We were really curious, so we stopped and asked what the hubbub was all about.  Turns out that Morton-Thiokol were scheduled to start a rocket booster test in a few minutes! So we found a spot to park, unpacked our picnic equipment, and watched them fire off a rocket booster horizontally, mounted to the ground to keep it stationary. It was the loudest thing I've ever heard in my life, even though were were at least 2 or 3 miles away."

The Republican business interests love all the cheap, desperate, labor they can exploit to a much harsher degree than they can legal American citizens. The Democrats and their big business backers are the same way, but pretend to play good cop by throwing them welfare paid for by other people. In addition, the Democrats love the population dynamics shift and the ability to bank on new voters.  The only people this situation doesn't benefit are the people who play by the rules and laws of society. Yeah, I guess it's tough shit for those of us having integrity. It's not an issue of race.

It has its share of issues, but I think just about anyone can find a place to fit in and enjoy it.   Since you are planning on becoming a resident, I assume you will spend your summers (or at least part of them) in town. In my opinion, this is when the town shines. The overcrowding dissipates (the school accounts for almost 50% of the population) and the more crotchety locals calm down. Combine that with the fact that you'll have more free time and the town becomes a real paradise. I did two summer school sessions there and I think back on them as the best of an already great college experience."

The debate the past 15 years was about privatizing the UC system because they wanted to stay competitive with amenities and other services that other universities on the high-end (private) were providing.  A lot of these immigrant students are dumb as doorknobs. Money talks and if someone is willing to pay $50K/ year to attend UC Merced...the UC Regents aren't going to turn them down. UC is as much a business as it is a research organization.  As opposed to a California resident who pays $15K and then the University has to figure out how to make up the the funding difference due to the lack of funding growth from the state legislature.

If you want to game the system, /u/trickform, then you should keep in mind that GI Bill pays BAH based on zip code where the school is at - and not based on where you actually live.  So what you should be looking for is a community college in an expensive zip code that is adjacent to an area with a low cost of living.  And the same is true later when you're ready to transfer to a 4-year: expensive zip code adjacent to low cost of living area.  Bonus points if you can find an area with both a decent community college and a university that are both in expensive areas, that are within commute distance of a lower cost of living area. That way you don't have to deal with moving half-way through. Bay Area and UC Berkeley worked great for me.  I finished college five figures more wealthy than when I started.

I loved living there for 2 years although I just moved to LA last month to get ready for UCLA. You should attend either Grossmont college in east county (where I went) or mesa college in central county. East county would be best bet as it would be cheaper and in your range.

California,3bvsy4,barrinmw,6,Fri Jul 3 00:58:56 2015 UTC,"No it isn't a precedent at all for California.  California first passed a statewide vaccination law in 1889.  According to the staff of the state Assembly there was no personal belief/""philosophical"" exemption until 1961.  The US Supreme Court ruled that states had the authority to require vaccination in 1905 in Jacobson v. Massachusetts, in 1922 in the case Zucht v. King they ruled specifically on vaccination requirements for school, and in Prince v. Massachussetts they ruled that religious beliefs didn't excuse parents from vaccination requirements.  I would point out that Mississippi and West Virginia don't have any non-medical exemptions.  Neither state has had a non-medical exemption for decades.  Curiously the anti-vaxxers never seem to point at any abuse of the law in those state.  All of the crazy problems that they claim would happen if SB 277 passed have always been hypothetical.

On this issue there seems to be one policy that:   will cause less suffering be more cost effective is consistent with science   The vague slippery slope arguments of government intrusion and freedom hold little weight with me in this case because a) they have been so overused that they have lost their credibility and b) our freedoms are not absolute. We live in a society where our right to do what we want is weighed against the rights, safety and welfare of others. Where the scale tips on this one seems obvious to me."

California,3bvsy4,widowdogood,3,Sat Jul 4 03:37:37 2015 UTC,"They are going to have an uphill battle to get this repealed.  According to a recent PPIC poll 67% of Californians felt unvaccinated children should not be allowed to attend public schools.  The exact question wording was ""Should children who have not been vaccinated from diseases like measles, mumps, and rubella be allowed to attend public schools, or not?""  Only 29% of those asked favored allowing those children to attend public schools.  SB 277 does also cover private schools but the vast majority of children don't attend private schools so I am skeptical that that would make a huge difference in voter's opinions."

Assuming you bought the car from a dealership, they would tape a paper temporary registration on the interior passenger side of the windshield that is good, I believe, for 6 months (longer than it should take for plates to get to you).  The DMV should be aware of that as long as you tell them you recently bought it and haven't gotten the plates yet. It would be beneficial if you have the paperwork available if they want some kind of proof.  If you bought the car used from a private party, I can't help. I've never bought a car from another person that didn't have plates.  disclaimer: Just because it shouldn't be a problem doesn't mean it won't be a problem.

California,3bx0uh,Acetylene,2,Fri Jul 3 00:24:52 2015 UTC,"Let's not resort to name-calling. We're adults here, right?  The point of the seat belt example was that just because her children aren't sick now doesn't mean they won't be in the future, just as the fact that I haven't been in a car accident so far doesn't mean I never will be. Several of the moms on that Facebook page were saying that their kids aren't spreading disease, because they're not sick. That's great, but none of them can guarantee that their kids never will get sick. Diseases like measles are seeing a resurgence right now. A woman died of measles today.  As for the ""by that logic, the wife would be spreading gonorrhea"" argument, well, yeah! She absolutely could be, without even knowing it. Most women with gonorrhea have no symptoms, or symptoms so mild they could be mistaken for a minor bladder or vaginal infection. Just as so many of the diseases we vaccinate against have no symptoms, or mild symptoms that can easily be mistaken for something else, in their early stages."

California state government is controlled by the democrats, special interest groups, lobbyists and labor unions.  Government workers and politicians get money thrown at them by pharmaceutical companies to use their drugs.    If you know anything at all about how drug companies and pharmaceutical manufacturers work, they are sales driven, they aren't non-profit or anything.  They have sales people who travel door to door at doctor's offices and wine and dine doctors to get them to give out free samples of their drugs and tell patients to try them.  There was this big rush years ago to get everyone vaccinated with Guardasil and then it was discovered that there were side effects of the HPV vaccine when the manufacturer got sued, then many health care providers stopped promoting it.    On top of that, we have a major problem with corruption in our state government.  Take AG Kamala Harris for example, she does not prosecute doctors and providers for medical malpractice, not unless they have killed hundreds of people.  If the public only knew how many deaths were caused by medical malpractice in California alone you'd shit yourselves.  These are some of the wealthy donors who contribute heavily towards political campaigns.  Let's not forget who capped medical malpractice civil suits to begin with, el grande hefe gallo himself, Gov. Brown."
California,3btxmg,ferae_naturae,3,Thu Jul 2 15:47:35 2015 UTC,"If you want to engage in cost debate I would rebut with: vaccines are cheap. No one is making money off of these vaccinations which lost exclusivity on patents like decades ago. Every patient at the community health center I was in paid on a sliding scale and basically maxed out at $40 a visit. That included the doses of vaccine. That includes Guardasil.  From the financial perspective again. Merck makes a quadravalent vaccine and is working on a hexavalent one I believe. Works on 6 strains. Covers strains responible for most common cause of genital warts and 2 of the strains responsible for cervical cancer.  3 doses and lifetime coverage.  The alternative is people getting pap smears, late detection of a completely preventable form of cancer, and then the cost of subsequent cancer treatment. You can imagine the cost runs there.   People are excited about a vaccination because it can represent the height of preventative medicine. Ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.   Now for the science of Guardasil. The total number of side effects reported was at like less than 0.1% on 10s of millions of doses given. The number one side effect? Syncope. People got woozy after getting the shot. Hell, people get woozy after seeing a needle in general. So just have them sit there for a spell before they leave the office/clinic. That's a small price to pay to prevent cancer. There are plenty of cancers you can't prevent. This one is completely preventable.   I can't comment on AG Kamala Harris and her office not prosecuting doctors. Last I saw, the federal government usually pursues these cases because Medicare fraud by its nature often crosses state lines. It's not the jurisdiction of the state. So a doctor is prosecuted for Medicare fraud but if a patient dies, that doctor is liable to go to state prison as murder is a state charge. That has definitely happened. If she hasn't, she definitely needs to do that."
California,3btxmg,phovendor54,-2,Thu Jul 2 17:02:51 2015 UTC,"I assume that because you know what ""quadravalent"" and ""hexavalent"" are that this makes you some kind of an expert here?  I like that California has invested millions on social media cheerleaders, I really do.  Our state government can do no wrong no matter what they do.  Also medical malpractice can be prosecuted federally and at the state level.  The local DA, state prosecutors and federal prosecutors can indict a provider for any number of reasons.  The sad thing is they never do.  Doctors and other health care providers do things so illegal in California without any repercussions it would curl your nose hairs.  Health care providers have an extremely strong lobby with the state.    And I have no idea how to respond to your concept of value.  I assume you shop at the 99 Cent store for everything, including condoms.  Just because The drugs are low cost does not make them good for you!

California,3brd99,Lol-I-Wear-Hats,2,Thu Jul 2 06:47:26 2015 UTC,"I feel that the trucking companies are detailed enough that a scaling levy on ton-miles could probably be implemented without too much difficulty.  The problem with the railroads is path dependency. As presently set up, they are really optimized towards hauling slow heavy freight which is so uneconomical to ship by road that even the road subsidies don't make up for it (ie coal, but also oil and frack-sand). Coal alone is 40% of class 1 tonnage and 20% of their revenue.  This wasn't always the case, but ever since they developed practical trucks in the 1920s and the Interstate Commerce Commission decided that they deserved a cut of the action, we as a society put the railroads on a path towards hauling little of value at no deliberate speed.  Since heavy train are murder on the tracks, and slow trains require little track maintenance, the marginal cost of passenger rail, that shared many efficiencies with fast freight, has gone up since the olden days.    Because the railroads are conservative, and path-dependent, this is why we don't see BNSF, UP, or the others throwing their heft behind road tolling or carbon pricing. While this would give them an economic advantage, it would be an advantage in a market segment which they largely abandoned decades ago and are not set up to really occupy today. If we wanted to fix this quickly, it's probably going to take some public largess."
California,3brd99,Ores,2,Thu Jul 2 07:02:11 2015 UTC,"You have a good point that trucks are so much more useful these days. It just bothers me that they're so heavily subsidized and it's rarely questioned, yet any rail subsidies of a fraction of the amount are often frowned upon."

There was no need for a ""mandatory"" vaccination law.   The vaccination programs worked really well, and many diseases disappeared from the U.S.  People began to forget about the horrors of diseases like measles.  Then the misinformation cycle started, with bad science, fears about vaccines causing autism, etc. People began to perceive a new risk to vaccinating their children and little risk to not vaccinating their children (because the diseases are not as prevalent anymore, ironically, thanks to vaccines).   The result: we need to start forcing people to vaccinate because they are no longer doing it themselves in sufficient numbers."

Third world immigration isn't the problem. Unregulated immigration with an emphasis on criminalizing and refusing access to public healthcare keeps those populations at risk for outbreaks and spilling over into epidemics is a problem. However, this is besides the point and completely ignores that animals populations serve a infectious reservoirs to a myriad of vaccine preventable diseases as well.   I also can't blame Californians for being kneejerk when practically eradicated diseases start showing up in public schools because the misinformed and religious decided to ignore logic, science and nearly a century of data for the application of mankinds greatest health measure. If they wish to practice insane health standards with their kids fine(I'm not fine with it morally, but legally), but don't do it on the taxpayers dime.   I also have to ask what you think the California legislature could have done? Force everybody? Welcome to the political shitshow then. They mandated standards for taxpayer funded operations.

I don't believe vaccines cause autism or any other malady. I don't want my kids getting measles, whooping cough, etc. I also don't want my kids to infect kids (or other people) who aren't/can't be vaccinated, with these diseases. In general I am for this bill. Here are the vaccines specifically listed as required, for which my kids are vaccinated:   (1) Diphtheria. (2) Hepatitis B. (3) Haemophilus influenzae type b. (4) Measles. (5) Mumps. (6) Pertussis (whooping cough). (7) Poliomyelitis. (8) Rubella. (9) Tetanus. (10) Varicella (chickenpox).   Source: http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/15-16/bill/sen/sb_0251-0300/sb_277_bill_20150219_introduced.html  There is one issue I take with this bill, and it is item number 11:   (11) Any other disease deemed appropriate by the department, taking into consideration the recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Academy of Family Physicians.   The HPV vaccine is on the list of CDC ""recommended vaccines,"" which means that it could be required in the future. Again, I'm not one of those people who worry this will ""make our kids think it's safe/OK to engage in sex"" or anything like that. But my wife has concerns about the safety of this vaccine, in the reported injuries. I've done some looking into it myself, and can't say I've found anything I find dangerous about this vaccine, but my wife fears for the safety of our daughter, if there's even a tiny chance of serious side effects from this vaccine.  I guess my whole point is that, the legislation is so open-ended, what's to prevent a potentially under-tested or ""rushed through"" vaccine from ending up on the list in the future, and putting kids at risk or barring them from attending school?

The point of this bill is to increase overall population immunity and reduce the risks associated with disease outbreak.  By making sure our school populations have high levels of vaccinated students reduces the likelihood that a vaccine-preventable disease can rapidly spread and pose a greater risk to the broader population.    The problem with California is that people who use the personal belief exemption for vaccines are not randomly distributed.  Some schools/districts have incredibly high levels of vaccination, while other schools/districts had a large number of people who used the personal belief exemption.  Those populations didn't have the herd immunity to prevent large-scale outbreaks.  This bill will hopefully fix that problem."

You seem to have an awful lot to say about something you clearly don't know enough about to have a legitimate case.    Mandatory vaccination has been held up by the Supreme Court, so your argument about unconstitutionality is completely off point.  It has been proven time and time again that there is a legitimate state interest in requiring vaccination as a condition to access to public education.  It is neither unconstitutional nor fascist.  Quit trying to villainize something without knowing all of the facts.    Schools (and by extension, the state) have a responsibility to make sure that students can learn in a safe and healthy environment.  The personal belief exemption allowed for an environment where herd immunity was reduced to a point where public schools were no longer safe or healthy for children with a legitimate health reason to not be vaccinated.

As we strive to eliminate infectious diseases through vaccination programmes, the relative impact of NSE of vaccines on mortality is likely to increase, raising important questions regarding the future of certain vaccine schedules http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21300095/  These data demonstrate that the cytokine profile of 6-month-old infants is influenced by the type of formulation of the pertussis vaccine they received at 2, 3 and 4 months of life.

It's really nothing more than hateful, bigoted hyperbole.  You need to dig a bit deeper on the actual history of Alta California to understand the truth.  Why should the statue stay?  Because of what Serra and others meant and mean to CA.  Had the Gold Rush happened a century before -- had the secular USA been the first real, prolonged contact with California's native peoples, they would have been totally annihilated.  Further, much of the crap that plagued/plagues the East Coast and the Deep South -- religious persecution, persecution based on one's original national origin, slavery, etc. would all have made their way to the West Coast in a big way.  They didn't due to Serra and those that followed him.  The Catholic influence in CA is still felt strongly today in Alta California and it all began with Father Serra thanks be to God."

In any event, I've never seen any proof that Serra and company ""tortured"" and ""enslaved"" the native peoples.  Humans were not treated back then as they usually are today in the western world.

If your landlord didn't refund your deposit, state law governs what happens to it. Your concern is that your unclaimed money will escheat to the state, which is the law in most US states. I guarantee your money is not unclaimed -- the landlord has it. He's not going to turn it over to the state. It's been spent.  What you need to know is the statute of limitations on claiming the unrefunded deposit. Every state has different rules, and the rules in each state vary based on whether the lease was written or not.

We've had Canadians who did vaccinate but this couple wanted to do it all natural raise their child vegan, etc.   From what I've seen on foreign vaccination documents, the regimen of shots and the diligence which the countries mandate the shots varies, but every country pretty much does their own version that is up to par. If a child didn't receive it, and we always asked, it was a matter of access, not desire. When those communities immigrate to the US, they maintain that attitude. Because where they come from pertussis is actually still a problem. Rotavirus is a problem. Hepatitis B has a 90% chance of chronic lifetime disease if a child gets infected during childbirth.   Compare that to the US where its not really there. Hell, I have yet to encounter the pediatrician under 55 who has managed a case of Measles encephalitis. If you don't really see it, you might not think its a problem."

California,3bk0s4,fasmaun,2,Tue Jun 30 22:22:46 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. It's the nature of the crisis of public health. Vaccines are so darn good that 1-3 generations (depends on how you define a generation) of healthcare professionals haven't seen certain diseases like measles. Certainly not full blown measles encephalitis. Victim of its own success.   So now you're a wealthy family, living wherever in Rancho Palos Verdes or Marin County, and you're thinking why is my child getting a polio shot....do we even HAVE polio in this country? What's the big deal? We can probably skip this. Oh and skip Hep B, that's a sex disease. My child isn't having sex at the age of 2 that's disgusting."

California,3bk0s4,fluxgator,14,Tue Jun 30 07:23:28 2015 UTC,"Medical student here. This video leaves a lot of questions. Every rotation I went on, in-patient or out-patient clinic and yes that includes pediatrics, all of this is discussed. Allergies, risks and benefits, everything. Even what to do in the rare event of an adverse effect from the vaccination that occurs in less than 1% of the population. What this man didn't disclose is the timeline of events which is very important. You can't attribute your child's condition which develop a month after the shots to the shots themselves.  And that line about the gold standard, double-blind control study is crap. We have something that works and is standard of care, you test newer developments and compare them to standard of care. So I compare it to existing vaccine regimen for ease, side-effect profile etc. A double-blind study with a new vaccine would be one group gets new vaccine, one group gets standard of care. So in the old days, one group would get 3 separate shots for Hep B, Dtap, and Polio, and the other group gets Pediarix (combo of the 3) and 2 sham placebo injections. You can't do it with one group getting the shot and one group getting nothing because that's unethical and a false comparison."
California,3bk0s4,phovendor54,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:36:55 2015 UTC,"With every single medical procedure, test, vaccination, etc. comes some kind of risk for adverse effect. Thousands of people die every year from cars but people continue to drive them because the risks are not too high for them. People can do what they want in private, but public institutions and areas like schools are controlled by the government for the health and safety that has been recognized by all medical entities to need a high rate of vaccination to survive diseases and prevent those incapable of receiving them safe from deadly diseases.  This guy's story may be one of the adverse effects of a medical procedure, but progress and health in life and medicine isn't stopped because of an unfortunate result of vaccines. These tactics of using the worst case scenario to bloody the entire vaccination program that has saved billions of lives is a good tactic by these anti-vaxxers, but it has no real merit."

Ask yourself how homogenous Denmark, Finland, Iceland, etc. are. They're absolutely right to risk stratify like that. The US for example, does not vaccinate for tuberculosis with the BCG vaccine. That's a decision that fits our country's makeup and risk factors.  What we do have here is we recognize that for a very low cost, we can administer a vaccine which will work for life. If the mother is Hep B positive? We add in a round of really expensive immunoglobulin at birth with the first dose, anything to fight off infection at birth. Because that's cheaper than the alternative.  Long term sequelae of Hep B is basically liver failure and death. There is no cure for Hep B right now. Only viral suppression."

California,3bn39d,tking5o,5,Tue Jun 30 15:28:57 2015 UTC,"Is this the cost argument? Ok.  Harvoni, Gilead's combo pill costs ~$100k. It has a sustained virologic response of 92-99% with Genotype 1 Hep C virus, which is essentially a cure. And there are alternative plans, regimens for patients who have failed treatment or have a different genotype. Doesn't mean you can't still get cirrhosis if you drink, doesn't mean you can't get liver cancer. It's  definitely not cheap.   The alternative? The old treatment of telapravir and interferon, which lasted a year, not 12 weeks, and had an efficacy rate somewhere between 40 and 60%, and horrible side effects. In the meantime, your liver is continuously fibrosed and you get the complications from the damage. You can develop cirrhosis, portal hypertension, you can develop esophageal varicies which can bleed and land you in the hospital. Add up that cost. If all that fails, you can put yourself on the waitlist for a liver transplant which, last I read, can cost the taxpayer $500k. And we have a limited number of livers to donate.  Kinda stuck between a rock and a hard place."
California,3bn39d,phovendor54,2,Tue Jun 30 18:15:47 2015 UTC,"This seems to me to be a scare piece to keep health insurance companies from having to pay for the drug that actually cures Hep C.  The lifetime costs of caring for patients with Hep C, including liver transplants, is much higher that the $80,000 that the drug costs to cure the disease.  See this study by the California Dept. of Public Health [pdf file trigger alert]. UCSF has this article on drugs that cure Hep C. People agree that the treatment is excellent, but as noted in that article, it's an expense that's occurred right up front instead of lasting the patient's lifetime.  According to this site, the cost of a liver transplant is over half a million dollars. The costs of treating Hep C and related diseases before a liver transplant is needed would include medical visits, other drugs, care for the resulting diseases from the damages caused by Hep C. Treatment of patients with Hep C is a risk for health care professionals (and amateurs, too, I'm sure).  By the time many Hep C patients are getting treatment, they're on the public dole because of their inability to work, thus letting health insurers off the hook.  The costs of not using a cure for Hep C is much higher than the billions that the health insurers will pay for the cure."

Just as the British scooners stood by off the coast. After Americans invaded shortly later to claim this Republic as part of America.

California,3bpnic,211logos,-3,Wed Jul 1 21:57:44 2015 UTC,Author has a point.  The flag was made with racist intentions.  Just like the confederate flag.  Our flag's history is just more obscure.

The author gives the Californios, Mexicans and Spaniards a pass it seems, ironic in that others accuse them of genocide. The fact is that at the time racism, sexism, etc was pretty rampant by our standards.  And there is more Mexican and Spanish influence in CA than the author seems to know. Our water law system for instance is heavily influenced by that law, as is CA's community property law. It was inherited from Mexican law. Someone needs a brushup in Ethic Studies 101.  Still, I'm all for revisionism. Think about it: place names, symbols, icons, etc were all created and popularized by long dead people. Even though they wanted to memorialize people they thought should live in memory forever, we may disagree. My neighborhood in Oakland is full of street names commemorating Spanish Civil War folks; deep searching in Google is required to figure out who many of them are.  Why can't we get CA flag 2.0?

They simply lacked the manpower to do to the remaining natives in the interior what they had already done to the natives who lived near the coast.  How is capturing the natives and forcing them to work in Missions and convert to Catholicism better than capturing the natives and forcing them to live on reservations? Neither was good or right, pretending one set of invaders was somehow magically morally superior in this case only serves to present a false ""golden age"" view of pre Bear Flag Revolt California.  I'm fine with an argument for the removal of the current California flag for moral or ethical reasons, but pretending that what it replaced had been a utopia that was ""racially integrated"" is wrong and simply false. White Spanish landowners ruled with writs of land ownership issued first by the King of Spain, and later the government of Mexico."

I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a script made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. If you want to create your own word cloud for another subreddit, you can post requests there. I have also done several requests and as I have several sports and city related dictionaries I use to filter out particularly common words that are not normally detected. If you would like one made for any subs, just say the word and I'll crank it out. The actual word maps were made through Wordle. My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as ""city"", “the”, “and”, “I'm”, as well as numbers were removed from the clouds.  I will be using this data to update my state/city/regional subreddit profanity analysis. I will also be running the numbers to see which of the subs have the most active discussion. My city and international clouds should be coming out in a week or so.  If you have any questions about specific frequencies of the words, the top words are under the third image in the album. I typically removed the largest words on the second and third images, as they were so large they typically made the other words harder to see.

For example, cap and trade currently allows timber operators to generate carbon credits even when they clear-cut a forest, so long as the cut is no larger than forty acres. And it allows up to 40 percent of the forest to be made up of trees less than 20 years old.    Yes, because clear-cutting a forest is fantastic for carbon sequestration. The mass of the trees being removed is literally equivalent to the mass of CO2 that was pulled out of the air, and clear-cut forests will grow back, meaning the whole sequestration process starts all over again. Deforestation is terrible for habitat loss, but actually beneficial in terms of CO2 sequestration."

Their drainage (and sewage) discharges into the bay and ocean, a saltwater body downstream of the delta, from which water cannot be extracted and re-used any more easily than existing seawater.   And net water reusability usually ranges about 20-30%, so that alone does not justify a significantly larger share.   Interesting fact: net water use is already factored into water rights, such that farmers can actually sue another farmer if they prevent their historical flow-through from occurring."

California,3bhccm,Vamproar,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:50:37 2015 UTC,"I think some of the scenery on I5 is pretty great, but I realize I'm an outlier on that point. It's hotter, and has tules in the winter. And it's fast food hell, and on any moderately busy day it can be a hassle to drive because of asshole drivers who park in the fast lane, and lots of truck traffic.  101 has many more choices for food. And the road varies so the traffic seems less frustrating, although it can get pretty clogged in places. The scenery can be pretty nice, particularly in the spring.  But in the end both suck. It's super slab. I almost like 99 better; very Buck Owens and Tom Joad. But for real fun try 33, 1, or 25.  And 101 and 5 north of the Bay Area are a whole different proposition."

It's just faster and I would prefer to get to my destination and spend time there rather than sit in the car with a view of the ocean every once in a while.  Driving through the valley sucks.  It's boring and ugly, but it's fast.  I live right next to the ocean so seeing the views while driving is something I do every day and not that impressive.    If you don't do this drive a lot the 101 is probably better because it's more fun, and has more places to stop, but if the drive is just to get somewhere the 5 is better."
California,3bimxu,CR7futbol,3,Mon Jun 29 15:13:57 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say you're planning too much, but there's a few things to consider. First off, it's an 8-9 hour drive from San Francisco to San Diego at best. If you go down the 1, which if you want to stay close to the beach you will, expect it to take longer. You won't be making it all in one day if you're stopping, but it's still time out of your trip. Second Yosemite is 3 hours east of San Francisco. In other words completely out of the way. Thats another 6+ hours round trip. California is a really big state. Try to plan in advance your trips and expect most places to have lots of traffic between 6-9am and 4-7 pm(maybe even 8 depending on construction, accidents, etc).   Also August is the hottest month in California. Not so much of a worry near the beaches which probably won't get much above 80, but the central Valley and most of Southern California will be well into the 100s.   And be sure to reserve camping spots. You can't just show up and expect something at the more well known spots.   As for any other tips, expect the bank to be broken. California as a whole is expensive. Tourist traps can be even more. If you can stay at a hostel, which they do have in most of the bigger cities, you'll save a bit. But gas is expensive and driving all over the place will take its toll on your wallet. Get the gas buddy app and look for the cheapest places you can find.   As for must dos can't really say. There's so much it just depends on what you're into. But camping is one of my favorites and the forests are beautiful, except they might be on fire because it's summer."
California,3bimxu,caustictoast,2,Mon Jun 29 18:14:24 2015 UTC,"Not too much, but plan for at least a day in the car.  Best route for this would be 101 to PCH/Hwy 1, then up through Big Sur along the coast.   Once you hit Monterey, go inland to Yosemite, then circle back to San Francisco.  Yosemite will be crowded in August.  Book ahead and plan for traffic."
California,3bimxu,kirbyderwood,2,Mon Jun 29 18:42:16 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that some people make reservations for some of these places like Big Sur/Yosemite a year in advance.    And if you are camping, some places won't allow you to attach things to the trees, so no hammock.  You will probably want to reserve a camp site for both in advanced.  Keep in mind the distances, California is really big.  Yosemite overnight is totally doable, but the campsites aren't always ""look at this amazing stuff!"".  Some of them are just in trees and you will have to drive to see anything.    Also, about hammocks,  Your site might not have two trees close enough together to put up a hammock (if allowed at all).  Parks here have a lot of rules.  Watch out for bears, Yosmite has a lot of bears."

The California State Railroad museum is awesome if trains and history are your thing. If you like art, the Crocker Art Museum is pretty good. Midtown Sacramento (between 15th and 29th streets just east of the state capital) is also great for walking and eating. Lots of cool old buildings, big trees, great eateries, art galleries and fairly bustling day or night.  If you want some physical activity, the American River Parkway is great for bicycling. It can be a bit seedy in spots, but is generally safe during daylight hours. There are a few bike shops around downtown and old Sacramento that rent bikes.  If you want to do some calm-water kayaking or paddleboarding, you can rent boats at the aquatic center at lake Natoma about 15 miles east of downtown.  Between Sacramento and Tahoe is Sutter's Mill (near the town of Coloma)- where gold was discovered and the gold rush was ignited. Lots of cool historical stuff there and also very pretty country. About an hour east of Sacramento.   Have fun!"

California,3bbh7r,streetlite,26,Sat Jun 27 17:01:12 2015 UTC,"The bill, introduced this week by Rep. David Valadao (R-CA), would direct officials to release more water through the state’s Central Valley Project, which provides irrigation and city water sources to a large portion of the state’s Central Valley. Under the bill, water flows couldn’t be limited by concerns about fish species like salmon and the Delta smelt unless there was concern over extinction of the species. By ensuring that more water moves through the project’s canals, supporters hope to make water more available to residents. The bill has the backing of California’s entire Republican House delegation, the Hill reports.    Ok so it's not completely as idiotic as I thought.  He's saying environmental restrictions on water restrictions to preserve habitats are too strict and hindering the rest of the state from getting water.  But then says restrictions should only go as to when the species is in danger of extinction.  So in essence, fuck the eco system to the brink and hope we dont do something stupid to completely destroy it. . So still incredibly stupid, but not as stupid as i thought.

California,3bbh7r,VegatarianT-Rex,2,Sun Jun 28 04:10:41 2015 UTC,"The whole bill is misleading anyway - the Governor has the power to suspend, and has already suspended, the environmental limits on water pumping during the drought emergency period, so this bill would only have the effect of increasing pumping during years of surplus.   This does NOT suspend the portion of the flow required to maintain low salinity in the Delta, which is necessary for it to continue to function as a conveyance for fresh water. Some argue that this low salinity is what fosters the invasive species that are a far greater threat than pumping to the well-being of the delta's natural ecosystem.   That's one reason I think the delta tunnels will be an unexpectedly great boon to the environment of the delta, as it will allow the delta to return to pre-modern salinity levels. It's also the biggest reason Delta farmers oppose the project - they depend on the fresh groundwater that has developed over decades of Delta management."

Through the secretive meetings of the American Legislative Exchange Council, corporate lobbyists and state legislators vote as equals on ‘model bills’ to change our rights that often benefit the corporations’ bottom line at public expense. ALEC is a pay-to-play operation where corporations buy a seat and a vote on ‘task forces’ to advance their legislative wish lists and can get a tax break for donations, effectively passing these lobbying costs on to taxpayers.  Along with legislators, corporations have membership in ALEC. Corporations sit on ALEC task forces and vote with legislators to approve “model” bills. They have their own corporate governing board which meets jointly with the legislative board. (ALEC says that corporations do not vote on the board.) Corporations fund almost all of ALEC's operations.  Participating legislators, overwhelmingly conservative Republicans, then bring those proposals home and introduce them in statehouses across the land as their own brilliant ideas and important public policy innovations—without disclosing that corporations crafted and voted on the bills.  ALEC boasts that it has over 1,000 of these bills introduced by legislative members every year, with one in every five of them enacted into law.

California,3b7eaw,gnorrn,29,Fri Jun 26 18:05:50 2015 UTC,"If you read the whole dissent, it's not really the issue. Scalia sees the majority opinion as a legislative rather than judicial ruling (he views their decision that marriage is a fundamental right is one that should only be determined by legislative bodies). You can debate whether or not you believe Kennedy's decision is within the traditional scope of the SCOTUS.  The long ramble here is just highlighting that the Justices are not representative of the demographics of the US, and therefore unqualified to be legislating. But that's actually the wrong argument - Congress isn't much better at matching the demographics of their constituency. The important difference is that Congress is elected (therefore legitimately representing the people), while Supreme Court Justices are not.  There's actually very little in any of the dissents on what the public would consider the ""conservative"" arguments - not much consideration is given to the morality of gay marriage or freedom of religion arguments."

The Supreme Court is an independent body that stands for the rule of LAW.   Consider if the Supreme Court had ""represented"" the will of all the people when it came to civil rights, when the vast majority of people in the US did not support them.   EDIT: That was Scalia's point apparently. I should've read more of his dissent.  Per /u/El_Sharko:     The Supreme Court is an independent body that stands for the rule of LAW.

California,3b7eaw,Tomji,3,Sat Jun 27 14:26:32 2015 UTC,I think we've been through this and the only way to establish equal protection is to make it equal and not to create another legal designation. That seems apparent when you're dealing with something that is ripe for discrimination.   Scalia is trying to make the argument about judicial activism instead of making an argument about the case. His response is intensely political and doesn't address the problem at hand.
California,3b7eaw,saltybilgewater,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:46:31 2015 UTC,"Even if we had been through it (not sure Brown v. Board fits) reaching equal protection is still open to various solutions.

Insisting that every State give and recognize gay marriage was not the only solution to this problem."

California,3b7eaw,el_Sharko,7,Fri Jun 26 20:04:27 2015 UTC,"It wasn't that simple. There a number of theories how it passed beyond voter turn out. Voters may have just voted ""yes"" in a dismissive manner, or it could've been an issue were people didn't really know what they were voting for. I was a college guy so I was very active politically at this time. We had a few forums on this ballot measure, actually. I was very much anti-prop 8. And I've concluded that with this ballot measure a large population of those voters were 'confused'. I talked to a few people who thought voting ""yes"" would uphold the status quo and therefore would be the best vote. These people should've voted ""no"" but didn't. I like to look at it like this: It wasn't framed to the public in a discriminatory manner. It didn't ""outlaw"" homosexuality domestically, but played this language game between domestic partnerships and marriage. They wished to add a defining clause to marriage to make it legally exclusive. A nuance to claim how marriage is a standing between two people, and those two people must be hetro. Anything beyond this notion would be the law of man which would apply to both. Seems reasonable to many people, I'm sure. They also argued, and this was what really swayed the vote, that homosexuality would be taught in schools and expose children to something which schools have no right to do. There was a lot of fear mongering ""but what about the children!"" going on. It appealed to emotion. People who don't intuit discrimination like I did, or you maybe, or many other people here didn't have any negative reaction to it. Yes voters weren't all anti-gay marriage, or anti-gay. They're were those who thought it a nice middle ground, those who believed that schools ought to remain neutral in teaching about homosexuality voted yes. I ran into more people of the ""schools stay out!"" than I did anyone who wanted to outlaw state sanctioned gay sex even among self proclaimed democrats. It was tough, I had the only ""vote no"" sign in my community, it seemed.   The schools argument was complete bullshit, but people bought into it."
California,3b7eaw,UserDrew,3,Fri Jun 26 20:41:52 2015 UTC,"And the Mormon Church pumped millions of dollars against gay marriage. Don't forget that part.

The backlash will just be bigots entrenching themselves against what they see as ""elites"" and ""activist judges"" forcing something on them. If this had been a decision by ""the people"" then they might have begrudgingly accepted it and hopefully eventually evolved on the issue.

California,3b7eaw,natched,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:33:47 2015 UTC,"That's not what I'm saying. What I mean is that while the status quo doesn't work, there are various ways to reach equality and each State ought to be allowed to pick whatever method they think works best for them.  1.) Allow everyone the right to ""marry"" and get legal benefits from it.  2.) Change the title of the legal document to something other than ""marriage"" for everyone (since some people are hung up on the word).  3.) Get the government out of marriage for everyone and make everyone equal regardless of relationship status.  I'm sure there are other ways but that's just off the top of my head."
California,3b7eaw,el_Sharko,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:17:49 2015 UTC,You keep repeating this as if it's within the power of the court to actually draft accommodating legislation.  Ultimately this is a court case like any other. The court makes a ruling and then explains why the ruling is so.  Every state can now adjust their own laws with the understanding that they cannot discriminate against homosexuals.
California,3b7eaw,guapomole4reals,0,Sat Jun 27 15:39:59 2015 UTC,"If they wanted to do those things, they could've done those things. They didn't and gave no impression of planning to do so.   We've got a completely Republican Congress - where is them passing a bill getting the federal government out of marriage? What states have completely removed their legal recognition of marriage?  This has been a problem, a violation of the 14th Amendment, for years and there has been no other actions taken to provide equal protection. Eventually, the Supreme Court has to step in.   The states had their chance to move away from discrimination, and they didn't.  This is especially noticeable given that the whole course of this argument pretty much directly follows arguments about interracial marriage, which was another time when the Supreme Court had to step in and overrule the states which were discriminating."
California,3b7eaw,natched,0,Fri Jun 26 21:34:04 2015 UTC,"If they wanted to do those things, they could've done those things. They didn't and gave no impression of planning to do so.   Correct. I assumed we both understood that.  My point is that rather than decreeing ""YOU MUST DO X TO CREATE EQUALITY"" the SC could have said ""You need to either do X, Y, Z, or come up with another plan to create equality.""  The court was right to demand equality. But deciding how that equality had to be reached may have been an overstep."
California,3b7eaw,el_Sharko,2,Fri Jun 26 21:44:37 2015 UTC,"They decided to reach equality the way the Supreme Court normally uses its power, the exact same way it used its power to end restrictions on interracial marriage.  The states had more than enough time. There were plenty of people pointing out this would be an equal protection issue in the Supreme Court.  I don't think it is the Court's job to not hurt the feelings of people who want to discriminate. Their job is, in large part, to see that the Constitution is followed, and a decision that said, ""sure gay people are being discriminated against with regard to marriage in violation of the equal protection clause, but we're gonna let it continue for a few years while the states get their shit together"" wouldn't really do that.   The harm to all of the people who couldn't get married during that period is not worth pretending that the states were about to do the right thing, but the evil Supreme Court robbed them of their chance.  If some states aren't happy with this outcome, the states could have prevented it by not discriminating in the first place."
California,3b7eaw,natched,2,Fri Jun 26 21:51:30 2015 UTC,"Again, you're ignoring the central point in my comment. It's not about ""hurt feelings"" it's about States rights, which were central to the foundation of this country.    The harm to all of the people who couldn't get married during that period is not worth pretending that the states were about to do the right thing, but the evil Supreme Court robbed them of their chance.

California,3b7eaw,el_Sharko,11,Fri Jun 26 22:13:46 2015 UTC,"He seems to be arguing against judicial activism (an argument I'm sure he's made many times before)   The strikingly unrepresentative character of the body voting on today’s social upheaval would be irrelevant if they were functioning as judges, answering the legal question whether the American people had ever ratified a constitutional provision that was understood to proscribe the traditional definition of marriage. But of course the Justices in today’s majority are not voting on that basis; they say they are not. And to allow the policy question of same-sex marriage to be considered and resolved by a select, patrician, highly unrepresentative panel of nine is to violate a principle even more fundamental than no taxation without representation: no social transformation without representation.   Here's the text: http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/3304543/posts  So, yes, he agrees with you insofar as: SCOTUS is not meant to represent the people.  And it does not represent the people.

California,3b7eaw,Vangazer,2,Sat Jun 27 00:38:24 2015 UTC,"There was a large controversy in the wording of prop 8 suggesting that it targeted blacks to vote wrong.  Also, there are a lot of democrats in the LA area that are poor and urban minorities, who probably don't view gays in a positive light.    Then you have places that are not college towns or major cities.  These places will almost always vote conservatively.  The central valley is like a transplant of the south for the most part, you see some pretty messed up stuff.  In addition to that, the bay area isn't totally liberal either.  South bay and silicon valley are fairly conservative.  Voting asians and mexicans might be voting against it as well.    Inland empire near LA and Pasadena also have a good amount of conservatives."

The Supreme Court represents the entire judicial branch because (1) it's at the top and has the final say on everything federal, and (2) the Constitution only requires a Supreme Court - not lower courts. Congress is authorized to create lower federal courts (and they have, for practical reasons), but the Supreme Court is the main component and all that the Constitution technically requires.   Saying the Supreme Court is not the Judicial Branch is like saying the President is not the Executive Branch because there are dozens of agencies that work for him (and which do not necessarily need to exist, from a Constitutional perspective)."

California,3b5nps,borg1011,17,Fri Jun 26 12:13:56 2015 UTC,"No, you put rails across major passes and down the central valley. to connect the big cities with the coastal ports and other large cities on the eastern border. Semi-trucks have an essential role to play but as it is now you have drivers (who are getting the short end of this stick no matter what, I'll admit) who are driving 15 hour days, many in a row, to get trucks from Nebraska to Oakland or from Seattle to Long Beach. There's no reason I should have to get stuck going 55 for 55 miles going up to the grapevine because a bunch of semis are in a constant passing war before they have to slug there way up a hill they can barely get over, and there's no reason we should have hundreds of drivers putting themselves and others at risk while trying to make unrealistic times and getting paid less (sometimes even fined by their companies) for obeying traffic laws and getting over to let passenger vehicles pass them, when all their cargo could be hauled much more fuel-efficiently on a single train.  We keep complaining about high speed passenger rail from Bakersfield to Sacramento, but realistically most Californian's will still drive because they like the freedom of being able to actually getting where they want to go rather than relying on terrible local transit systems or cabs. Freight cargo doesn't need to be able to drive out to a pretty vista point or a fancy restaurant or from a house in a sub development to the nearest convenience store 2 miles away. It goes from point A to point B, and faster is almost always better. Trains just make more sense for long distance shipping, if we actually gave them the infrastructure they needed.   Full disclosure: Several generations of my family worked on the SP as engineers, both on trains and for the tracks, so I may be slightly (slightly) biased."

Meanwhile, richer folk drive only a little more, sometimes not at all, and the tax is barely noticable.  Lets not kid ourselves that all freeway traffic is equal. This damage is 90% due to semi-trucks. They slow traffic, they destroy roads, they dump trash and shredded tires, the list just goes on.

An 1800 lbs car would get charged the same as a 5000 lbs car.  Yet the heavy car does more damage.  It turns out the car mileage ( and therefore gas tax revenues) correlate very nicely with car weight and therefore with road damage.  So you get   revenue == road damage, exactly what you'd like.  I agree that electrics get an ""out"" here. I'm ok with that in the short run, just like I'm ok with all the other subsidies they get.  Perhaps in 3-4 years we can ask ONLY the electrics for a per mile tax which is ALSO proportional to car weight."

That said, the poorest folks I know use that shitty public transit anyway, because they cannot afford things like fuel, maintenance, insurance, and so forth.

Summers get (very) hot inland, so the northern coast is a sanctuary.  Public transit in California can be tricky, so plan ahead. Sonoma (Napa) are pricey wine growing regions, but exemplify what California should be like for the active traveler. Stopping in towns like Sonoma, Sebastopol, Healdsberg, Bodega Bay, Mendocino in addition to other northern points like Muir Woods and Mount Tamalpias in Marin County are all places that took me years to find as a native, but are priceless along with my other world travels.  In Southern California I might recommend the old Getty Villa Museum in Pacific Palisades.  Sure its a museum and maybe as a European you had enough of Roman ruins, but its outside and close to LA proper and just up the road from the Venice Beaches.  Good luck on the house party thing."

California,3b345x,RNAPII,9,Thu Jun 25 16:56:33 2015 UTC,"San Jose is known as having a pretty lackluster nightlife.  It's really not walkable for the most part other than a few streets and Santana Row.  As someone else said the tech museum is pretty interesting, and there is the winchester mystery house which is kind of meh.  Depending on when you come a Sharks game or 49s game would be fun.  Other than that it's just a sprawling suburb.  Santa Cruz is close and I would rather vacation in SC than San Jose, it's more vibrant and fun.    San Francisco, Berkeley and Oakland are much more interesting places to visit if you want a nightlife experience.  Oakland has gotten a lot safer, but you still need to be cautious, but SF has bad areas as well.    You haven't said how long you would be here, but people often underestimate the size of California.  You'll be traveling a lot if you want to hit all of those places.  There also isn't a very direct route to Vegas from the bay.  Flights are cheap, though.    If you MUST spend time in LA for beaches and stuff stick to places like Santa Monica, Hermosa beach and those small beach towns, but it's pretty obvious.  California beaches are typically pretty cold as well, and the southern ones are crowded.    If you're coming from England then Yosemite is a good choice, but figure out your accommodations.  Most people in Yosemite camp, so you will need gear to do that,  they do have cabins but I think they fill up fast (never considered a cabin myself).     Santa Barbara is cool, and I would rather spend time there than LA.    You should say when you are coming and for how long, it will allow for better ideas."
California,3b345x,BlueShellOP,3,Thu Jun 25 17:31:33 2015 UTC,"San Jose Resident here,  Yeah it's a sprawling suburb. The nightlife is meh at best. It's a well-known non-tourist area. Lots of cool tech companies are in this area, though."

California,3b345x,surf_wax,6,Thu Jun 25 18:34:45 2015 UTC,"Don't skip LA, it's great.  I just moved down here from the SF Bay Area, and it's been very neat to see all these names and places I've learned from TV and movies.  You can drive by the Walt Disney and Warner Brothers studios in Burbank (I think WB offers a tour), go look at the Avenue of the Stars in Hollywood (Hollywood is kind of seedy, but there's neat stuff to see), go to Disneyland down in Anaheim, visit Venice Beach and Malibu and Santa Monica, which is very walkable and I think has a boardwalk.  Mulholland Drive and Sunset Blvd have some big fancy houses to look at, and Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills sometimes has celebrities if you're into that.  Don't write off LA, but give yourself some time to get through it, because the metro area is huge.  It takes me two hours or so to get from Camarillo to Norco (about halfway through, or so).  That's the distance from Sacramento to San Francisco, which was road trip worthy when I lived in Northern California.  San Francisco is amazing.  Alcatraz is neat to see, but it'll take at least half your day.  Golden Gate Park is massive, bigger than Central Park in New York City, and it has a natural history museum.  You can cycle across the Golden Gate Bridge and take a ferry back to the Embarcadero or Pier 41.  There are neat houses everywhere.  Muir Woods, Monterey (nice aquarium, Cannery Row) and Point Bonita are all nearby, and you can see Big Sur or Pinnacles National Park on your way down to LA (unless you're going into Yosemite from there, then I'm not sure)."
California,3b345x,GoodAaron,9,Thu Jun 25 19:42:47 2015 UTC,The people telling you to skip LA are probably the ones that have made a conscious choice to not live there and have strong opinions about it. LA is great if you know what you are looking for.
California,3b345x,purpleRN,5,Thu Jun 25 18:21:14 2015 UTC,"San Jose's not that bad. The Tech Museum is pretty awesome.  But really, if you're going to be in this neck of the woods, I'd swap out San Jose and go to Santa Cruz instead. It's a University/beach town, with a great Boardwalk. On Wednesday nights during the summer, there are free movies on the beach, and free concerts on Fridays. If you want to do something ridiculously California-touristy, you should check out The Mystery Spot. It's one of those woo places that has ""strange magnetic fields"" and ""weird gravity."" It's also great for hiking. Lots of pretty redwoods."
California,3b345x,CWHz,5,Thu Jun 25 17:06:30 2015 UTC,"RE: Yosemite It's jaw-dropping and should absolutely be visited, however I would try to go during the week if you can to avoid the large crowds. Also, strolling in in the afternoon (or even late morning) and attempting to find a campsite ANYWHERE will result in stress and sadness. Reserve a campsite or motel outside the park if you can, or come in really early to get one of the first-come first-served sites in the high country and drive into the valley for the day. If you and your mates are up for it, go for a hike as well."
California,3b345x,thedurka,3,Thu Jun 25 17:42:02 2015 UTC,"Also -- get out of the valley! Yosemite valley is 3% of the park and contains 95% of the tourists.

California,3b7nfb,Commotion,-7,Mon Jun 29 04:34:52 2015 UTC,"Dear Governor Brown:  I know you are getting bombarded with phone calls, emails, faxes and appointment requests from people opposing SB277. And I am sure it can be frustrating since the “science is clear” that “vaccines are safe and effective.”  But I ask you to consider a few points. Please. For all that is rational and logical and American, please hear me out.   If vaccines are so wonderful, why would they be forced on us? Our pediatricians have a duty under AB2109 to inform us of a vaccine’s risks and benefits so that parents can make an educated choice. And speaking of risks, it is a fact that vaccines do carry a risk. How can you force someone to undergo a medical procedure that carries risk, no matter how small? And how small is that risk? And what exactly is that risk? The problem is that there is conflicting information and no one knows for sure how prevalent or serious the risk of a vaccine is. Again, that begs the question: how can you force a medical procedure on us when the risk is unknown? In discussing the importance of vaccines, people often parrot words and phrases with no real context. They simply recite: “polio, smallpox, herd immunity, measles outbreak.” Unfortunately, these same people have no real education on the history of these issues; they have done little to no reading about the insanity and danger of the original smallpox vaccine, or about how many of these diseases were on a dramatic decline prior to a vaccine simply due to better sanitation and nutrition. People are in a panic and making irrational “mob” decisions. Surely you can see this. I recently visited Disneyland, and I came into contact with pretty much everyone there (it’s crazy how many times you see the same people as you make your way through the park). After seeing the filth, crowds and being pressed up against other people in line for hours, I have to say that it is miraculous that the “measles outbreak” was limited to such a small number of people. And correct me if I’m wrong, but weren’t a substantial number of those infected people who had already been vaccinated? So, are you mandating that I and my family undergo the risk of a vaccine without a guarantee of benefits. How is this okay? America is the ONLY country in the world founded on absolute freedom and individual, capital enterprise. Forcing a medical procedure on a healthy individual flies in the face of our nation’s principles. And let’s not forget about denying a child the right to an education. If my husband and I are working and we have 3 kids who have not been vaccinated, how do we school them? We can’t even put them in a private or charter school, correct? I’m sure you can see homeschool is not an option unless we quit our jobs and go on welfare. And we are not licensed or credentials or teachers, so how do we ensure our children get a proper, or at least equivalent, education? How will they get into college? Can they even go to college if the personal belief exemption is negated at the university level, too? If you take away this freedom from us, what is next? I know you have spoken to people from disease-ravaged nations who can’t fathom the idea of opting out of a vaccine. Ask those people what kind of conditions they lived in, and they may tell a different story. Then ask someone who fled from Communist Russia, where everything was mandated and their planned economy meant that cold and starving people waited in line for hours for a single loaf of bread. Ask them how they feel about the US government mandating vaccines under a schedule that is subject to change on the whim of a pharmaceutical company’s “risk report.” It should be apparent at this point that SB277 is a tyrannical measure and an extreme overreaction. I understand there is a fear of a serious, infectious outbreak in this country, and I respect that. I’m scared, too. But, please, take these other points into consideration. Allow us to decide for ourselves and our families what we put into our bodies. And if there is a serious outbreak, and vaccines are indeed so safe and effective, then aren’t all those vaccinated protected anyway? And now you’ll tell me that those who are “immune-compromised” or have an actual medical exemption are still vulnerable. Yes, I agree. But they’re also vulnerable to a host of other viruses and bacterial infections for which a vaccine does not exist. So please tell me again why it is okay to force an ever-growing schedule of vaccines on my sweet and healthy baby.   Thank you for your consideration. Please continue to make me proud to be an American.  With love, Jamaica Winship"

The rest work in industries that citizens and legal immigrants work in. Illegal immigrants have brought the wages down in those markets. Of all the industries they work in, agriculture is really the only one we need to import workers for because of what would be a shortage of native workers. The labor laws are different for agriculture, which amounts to less pay and benefits. For what the job physically entails, it's not really worth having a job on a farm at least for the long term. Even foreign born people shouldn't be working those jobs indefinitely and continuously. That's only going to lead to a slew of health problems sooner or later. We already have some kind of seasonal worker exchange program in agriculture where you can apply and legally immigrate to the US and work for a set amount of time, go back to your country of origin when your contract ends and then reapply after 3 months but the number of these types of visas is limited. An expansion of that type of visa is all we would need to solve the worker shortage."

The policy is for one year and includes the following standard coverage: $100,000/$300,000 bodily injury liability coverage $50,000 worth of property damage liability $5,000 worth of medical payments coverage $30,000/$60,000 uninsured motorist coverage Comprehensive coverage with a $250 deductible Collision coverage with a $500 deductible 50-51 insurers provided sample premiums for each county. Major insurers such as Allstate, GEICO, Mercury, Progressive West, and State Farm were included. For counties that were broken up into smaller subregions, the lowest quote for the county is the average of the lowest quote for all subregions within that county.

California,3b01nw,AllThatJellyNoToast,2,Wed Jun 24 21:49:18 2015 UTC,"Short answer: if you can afford it, buy your own policy directly from a provider (Blue Shield, Kaiser Permanente, whatever you want) instead of going through Covered CA.  You can either use COBRA to continue your existing coverage (you pay the entire premium, rather than your company paying it or partially paying it), or you can purchase your own policy.  Generally you can only purchase or change coverage during the open enrollment period (I think it starts in October, I didn't check), but since you have a qualifying event, you may do so when you leave that job.  If you want assistance with paying the premiums, apply via coveredca.com, which sucks. You will likely qualify for Medi-Cal if you are unemployed. As I understand it, Medi-Ca coverage is retroactive to the month of application.  Note 1: By the time you get it all straightened out you'll probably be at the end of that three months, so...it's probably not worth it.  Note 2: If you qualify for Medi-Cal you will also be required (though they don't verify) to apply for unemployment, so that's another bag of crap to deal with."

Hemenway contends the Kleck and Gertz study is unreliable and no conclusions can be drawn from it. He argues that there are too many ""false positives"" in the surveys, and finds the NCVS figures more reliable, yielding estimates of around 100,000 defensive gun uses per year.

And, I'd appreciate a list of people who survived shooting themselves in the head, before I accept it as a problem.

California,3au327,hsfrey,1 point,Wed Jun 24 05:13:14 2015 UTC,"hanging, electrocution, gas chamber   All of those have been outlawed in most states of the US for decades, iirc. Lethal injection only fails like 3% of the time, which is pretty rare compared to the failure rate of the previous techniques. As for your ""no blood"" claim, maybe they just realized that blood makes a huge damn mess? And it's a biohazard, too, so cleaning it up properly is expensive.  As for headshots not being 100% effective for suicide, the very first google result for ""gunshot suicide success rate"" is this, which references a 90% success rate for headshot suicides. A 10% failure rate is way worse than 3% for lethal injection."

Texas is the second most populous state, and look, it has a high rate of gun violence.

You can't magically discard the data on the premise ""well they had more people"" when the data clearly shows overlap between loose guns + lots of gun = violence in states big and small.

It isn't my goal to protect the VPC, before today I don't recall ever even hearing about them, but I think it's my duty to hear you out.  The first source claims that the VPC was misleading because it claimed ""Gun Deaths Outpace Motor Vehicle Deaths in 10 States in 2009"" and goes on to say that it was wrong to include ""deaths caused by gun accidents, gun suicides, gun murders, gun deaths by the police or military and undetermined"" which doesn't make any sense.   The VPC article claimed ""gun deaths"", not just ""gun murders"" or ""gun suicides"",  so it makes sense to include them all.  You could argue that it was misleading to use such terminology, but I don't think there's an easier way to describe death with a gun other than, well, gun deaths.  The second source was a rough read, but it led me to read up on the VPC's report of ""concealed carry killers"" which is basically a ton of bullshit.  It's an attack on the character of individuals with concealed carry permits, and isn't really data.  It's also really cool, because in doing research about the articles mentioned in the second source, I found your third source!

Simply pointing out that the VPC is not considered a very credible source in many circles.  The links I provided came from arguably the same kind of zeal used by the VPC and are equally as biased and lack truthiness as well.  But they are two sources on exactly opposite extremes of the spectrum, a place where lies and misleading information are born.  Many people will see VPC and immediately disregard the argument.

California,3au327,88mmKwK36,2,Tue Jun 23 18:31:13 2015 UTC,Not entirely accurate.  California law limits you to one handgun purchase every 30 days from an FFL.  A person can buy as many handguns as they like from private parties.
California,3au327,zloz,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:42:53 2015 UTC,"It is accurate.  The topic of dispute is an ostensible ""deluge"" of out of state guns being transferred into CA. A gun crossing state lines is not a private party transfer, it is an FFL-to-FFL transfer limited to 1 in 30 days by California law. Again, a civil rights encroachment which has not ever solved any problem."
California,3au327,kaiserbfc,0,Wed Jun 24 00:43:33 2015 UTC,"Well the California law is stopping people from purchasing those handguns in California, I'm not sure if they'd be legally allowed to stop you from being guns from out of state.  If they could, then they should probably get on that, but I wouldn't call the whole thing a failure."
California,3au327,zloz,4,Tue Jun 23 18:53:28 2015 UTC,Federal law prevents a CA resident from buying a gun in other states.

In short your position exists due to convenience, not moral superiority.  My belief is that people talk about banning guns because it's a real discussion involving pros and cons. People in your boat stay the hell away from mental illness and it's treatment because it's a much more complicated conversation that requires way more thought than, ""remove object from society.""  We need real conversations, not 10% decreases in suicide."
California,3au327,Hazy_V,3,Tue Jun 23 18:39:08 2015 UTC,"I was not arguing about banning guns to solve mental illness or suicide at all. You asked what would have stopped the person from jumping off a bridge and any deterrent to suicide will stop at least some people, occasionally long enough for them to get help.  OF COURSE we need to have a much better system for dealing with mental illness and work on reducing social stigma behind it and asking for help. But deterring suicide in different ways is a good start, and honestly I have no actionable idea how to do that with guns, not in the society we live in."
California,3au327,megnn,3,Tue Jun 23 19:19:32 2015 UTC,"Sorry, my point is you missed the point. We need to come up with solutions to suicide and mental illness, banning guns is a straw man you've set up to take down to feel productive. Gun control doesn't change the nature of suicide."

Your absentee daddy-government won't protect you from the boogie man if he ever comes. Thats a personal responsibility that can't effectively be given over to anyone else after you reach adulthood. Good luck with whatever tools you choose to help you with that. I'll bet most Germans in the 1930's and 1940's wish that hadn't given up their most effective self protection to the NAZIs when they came to get them. I'll bet 30 million other humans wished they hadn't either. Be careful what you wish for. There are always unintended consequences.
California,3au327,gumboking,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:21:24 2015 UTC,"Good grief.  You know it was the Allied Powers that disarmed the German population following occupation in 1945?  German police weren't allowed to carry guns for over a decade following WWII.  While Nazi policy allowed for the systematic disarming of undesirable people, including Jews, a similar act would be unconstitutional even if there weren't a 2nd amendment.  Liberal gun policies of the US didn't help the Japanese avoid internment.  It's fine for you and I feel safe in a society where we have triple the rate of firearm deaths than any other developed country. But that doesn't mean our existing gun policy is sound governance.  Public policy can't be measured only by how well it serves an individual."
California,3au327,thedrew,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:10:52 2015 UTC,"Violent crime is at an all time low according to FBI stats, mass shootings are at an all time low even though the news media would have you thinking something else. Your chances of getting shot are 5 times higher from a police officer that mistakes your comb for an uzi than from a criminal yet you want to take everyone's gun to solve what problem? The untreated mentally ill are responsible for nearly every mass killing we've had in the last 50 years. How about we fully fund a healthcare system that takes care of that and then see if there are still enough scary things the news can dig up to motivate you into trying to take my guns.  In every other developed country the police shoot almost no one. The USA is a different story. If the police break into your home at 3am and you awake to this small army invading your home and pull your glock from the safe you will die in a hail of bullets. But you want more of my tax dollars to enable this BS.   The ""goddamn constitution is just a piece of paper"" George Bush This quote may be inaccurate according to some but that's the way GW Bush and Obama have treated it and their actions are far more telling than the maybe quote. I'm the only one ultimately responsible for protecting me and my family from harm. I deserve and demand an effective tool for that purpose and the ultimate ends of disarming people are nefarious or naive wishful thinking."
California,3au327,gumboking,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:18:07 2015 UTC,I don't think massive disarmament is seriously entertained by any public safety advocates.  However the notion that any regulation is an infringement on the right to keep and bear arms halts meaningful public policy.  You're not likely to find many gun control advocates who oppose improvements to mental health services.  It is foolhardy to believe we must choose between helping the troubled seek care or preventing the troubled from hurting others.
California,3au327,MissValeska,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:10:09 2015 UTC,I didn't setup a false dichotomy between healthcare and gun regulation. I merely suggested directly addressing the root cause would be more effective than trying to do the impractical job of taking away guns or simply making criminals out of those that don't comply with the laws.  If you don't think massive disarmament is possible you only need to look to the recent case of Australia. Remember those pictures of thousands of guns being loaded into the grinder machines? We seem to be doing the same thing incrementally at the local scale and via stealth internationally by secret and not so secret international treaty.   What is the goal of your meaningful public policy? I see all new regulations and many that are already in place as hindering my ability to effectively protect myself and my family. No public policy is ever going to replace that.   How many regulations will it take to achieve your public policy goals? It's already illegal to shoot someone. With fertilizer I can blow up a building. I can always buy a gun from a criminal who doesn't care about laws. If you can't effectively fix the supply problem you should think about trying something different.

That's why Republicans absolutely hate it, because if it's successful we'll be building these railroads all over country. Less money spent on cars, gasoline, and less money in the pockets of those who support them (the fossil fuel industry). In their minds there is nothing to gain from HSR succeeding, so you see this opposition from the conservative side of the political spectrum.

It was never a promise of 'all the taxpayer would chip in'.  It was only specified that the public would not fund operations.  The remaining money is being funded by other state funds (like cap-and-trade, which the voters approved of via prop 23), federal funds, and private investment."

California,3arswc,traal,2,Wed Jun 24 18:28:02 2015 UTC,"I flew to SFO from Socal a few months ago. It was $73 each way...   You must have purchased your tickets ahead of time, because the average cost of a flight from SFO to LAX is $145.58 according to GoFox.com.  A one-way fare of $145.58 will be very easy for HSR to beat.   ...and my flight was about an hour.   Curb to curb, how long did traveling take? It was likely closer to three hours.  Now think about the value of the land occupied by an airport. In California, that is a lot of money. Add the amortized value of that land, plus the loss of property taxes from that land when comparing an airport with a bullet train station, and you'll see that high-speed rail is much, much more cost-effective."
California,3arswc,Gregorofthehillpeopl,-1,Tue Jun 23 18:24:48 2015 UTC,Curb to curb was about three hours.    Hsr for the train alone will be four.  Add TSA times onto that (yes the TSA is already checking trains) and we're at 6+.  Flying still cheaper and quicker.
California,3arswc,traal,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:51:50 2015 UTC,The IOS (planned operation in 2022) and its estimated 4 hour travel time is just a temporary measure until Phase 1 Blended is complete in 2029.

California,3arswc,Gregorofthehillpeopl,3,Tue Jun 23 19:50:01 2015 UTC,"The flight itself from NorCal to SoCal is pretty fast, but you still have to get to the airport an hour ahead of time, if not sooner so that all needs to be factored in. Then there's the issue of delays due to weather and the like.   I've ridden highspeed rail in other countries, in China specifically I've made it to the train station 10 minutes to departure and still made it onto the train. It's a more comfortable experience, even if it does take longer. So I can definitely see the appeal.   But as other people have said, I'm skeptical of this, I'd love for it to work out, but rail has never been a major form of transportation in the US. Rail travel just generally doesn't appeal to Americans, I think, because of our well developed highway system and low fuel prices."
California,3arswc,Lol-I-Wear-Hats,3,Tue Jun 23 17:54:17 2015 UTC,"Rail travel just generally doesn't appeal to Americans, I think, because of our well developed highway system and low fuel prices.   California is home to 3 of the 5 busiest intercity rail lines in the country - and two of those lines are basically going to be integrated into HSR."
California,3arswc,Gregorofthehillpeopl,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:56:02 2015 UTC,"That might be true, but looking at passenger numbers, LA had 1.6 million riders in 2013 which wouldn't even make it a medium size airport hub.   I'm not saying that no one rides the railroad, clearly people do, but it's just not all that popular of a form of transportation. The fact that freight trains have priority on the tracks over Amtrak attests to this.   The North east is definitely the first place that should get a high speed rail due to population density. I know there's Acela but that's hardly high speed compared to what's available elsewhere."
California,3arswc,OmicronNine,2,Wed Jun 24 22:05:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but that's with rail travel that is nowhere near time competitive with driving. It's not popular with as many people because it's not as useful for as many people. That's also for rail travel that is strictly regional and does not connect with San Francisco. Meaning they are not a competitor with airports in any capacity and therefore cannot be compared in that way. Once the service becomes time and use competitive with airports, only then will that comparison be meaningful."
California,3arswc,hitlerbong69,-1,Wed Jun 24 22:23:31 2015 UTC,TSA is already checking Amtrak trains.  They're going to check hsr.
California,3arswc,traal,2,Tue Jun 23 19:52:50 2015 UTC,They 'check amtrak trains' as in occasionally someone looks at an Amtrak train. You can board an Amtrak a few minutes before it departs if you don't need to check luggage (and only because luggage needs time to be loaded).     Trains go on tracks. You cannot fly them into buildings.

California,3arswc,godisnotgreat21,2,Tue Jun 23 22:08:24 2015 UTC,You cannot point a train at a specific target. You cannot hijack a train and take it somewhere it was not already going. Trains can be subject to bombings but that's just as true for BART as it is for HSR...this risk is incredibly slim and not enough to warrant any pre-boarding screening.

California,3arswc,seven_seven,13,Tue Jun 23 05:32:33 2015 UTC,"Yes, Prop 1A was passed in 2008. The project has been tied up in the courts for years, the State Supreme Court ruled in the HSR Authority's favor last summer. Hence construction has now started in 2015."

California,3arswc,saw2239,10,Tue Jun 23 15:47:16 2015 UTC,Eminent domain is necessary to the success of our nation and was enshrined by our founders in the Constitution.   No ones having their land stollen and relatively few landowners are having any land taken through eminent domain. Everyone will be compensated and if it weren't for this government power then we'd have practically no infrastructure with which to run a country.   It's crazy when you think about just how shitty the U.S. would be without eminent domain powers.
California,3arswc,seven_seven,4,Tue Jun 23 14:35:48 2015 UTC,"We certainly wouldn't have most of our highway system, nor a lot of our airports and other major transport facilities, so yea, the country would be pretty shitty."

California,3arj1e,jefferyjp1,18,Mon Jun 22 22:45:43 2015 UTC,"Jane Jacobs might have cast San Bernardino, even during it's more prosperous days, as part of the interminable 'Grey Area' suffering from the Great Blight of Dullness, for which there would be little surprise that it's gone to ruin, given it's lack of inherent attractions and thoroughly suburban, single usage space.  She said such things about the Detroit of 1960, long before the city had reached it's present state of decrepitude.    Charles Marohn and the Strong Towns folks would probably tell you that San Bernardino is dependent on an economic model that needs a high level of infrastructure per capita to function, and one that doesn't not actually generate enough return to maintain all that pavement and piping in the long run. As the birthplace of MacDonalds and Taco Bell, it would be all together fitting that the home of such motordom dependent corporate welfare would be there.    Places like San Berardino were not built to last.  There structure is not resilient in the face of a shifting economy, and they do not have enough inherent strength to adapt to change.  They are hobbled by the high cost of maintaining the infrastructural legacy that yesteryear over-invested in (and today continues to splurge on while the old crumbles), and while similar areas in more desireable locations are propped up by their natural facilities and proximity to bustle and diversity, the Inland Empire does not enjoy that advantage.    Most of America after 1945 was built this way, and to varying degrees that story repeats itself all across the country as places built to absorb more value than they create start to catch up with their faults.    Edit: For further reading, what Charles Marohn actually said"

California,3arj1e,DTLAgirl,3,Tue Jun 23 09:06:10 2015 UTC,Thanks for bringing up this massive issue facing many cities now and in the coming years.  San Bernardino has dug itself into a hole which it is going to struggle substantially to get itself out of.  Extreme sprawl with little industry outside of large employers with low wage employees is part of the formula that is dooming many cities.  Staggering infrastructure costs will keep increasing until the city implodes on itself and the basics of modern life will shutdown.  I hope similar cities are paying attention to the abysmal management of San Bernardino.

There's probably quite specific controls on what activities can be done where, how far they need to be separated, how much parking there needs to be,  and other rules which have contributed to a non-durable built form."
California,3arj1e,Asha108,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:25:21 2015 UTC,"I more meant regulation of the housing market. I mean, where I live was basically the epicenter of housing speculation. I used to drive past apartment complexes that weren't even finished that were being sold. Hell, my house was built during the housing boom and has some real bad stuff wrong with it because it was built quickly and without much thought to what would happen if someone was to actually try to live in it."
California,3arj1e,Lol-I-Wear-Hats,3,Tue Jun 23 14:31:34 2015 UTC,"The big problem in terms of the municipal budget isn't so much the new housing, but rather the old housing. San Bernardino would be among America's oldest post war suburbs, and suburbs are infrastructure intensive. All that pavement, sidewalk, water main and sewer built when McDonalds was two brothers' hamburger stand wears out and the city hasn't been able to generate enough property tax revenue to replace it.  It's very likely that maintenance has been funded by all that new development revenue, which according to the article I linked above made up a large share of the revenue.    The problem with suburbanism is that when the municipality can no longer draw enough new development revenue to fund the old maintenance obligations, things go south quickly. It is the essence of an unwitting ponzi scheme"

You're getting downvoted but there's an element of truth to what you're saying.

Liberal California, on the other hand, is basically the wild west when it comes to letting predatory lenders allow people to get in way over their heads."

Also, my family and I are in the process of searching for hotels and we can't seem to find any around SF (Budget is around $200 a night) so are there any recommendations for that, too?   go to hotwire, and check the 'secret rate' option. you can pick the area and you know the price, but you don't know the exact location until you book it. go with 3+ stars and you should be good to go (hotel ratings are pretty standard)  places to avoid:  tenderloin (district in SF), east palo alto, east san jose, richmond, east/west oakland (these are all the ghetto areas of the bay area)  you can also check out r/sf and r/bayarea.   you can probably fill your itinerary with tripadvisor. lots to do in sf. have fun!"

It's fun to stay in downtown, but you can seriously up the quality of the hotel by driving out just a bit.   There is plenty to do in SF. But don't forget to just sit around and enjoy the place as well. Golden Gate Park and Crissy Field are good places to do this. Also, make sure to get your Alcatraz tickets now because they often sell out long in advance, especially in the summer.   Eat plenty of sourdough.

California,3aslxe,gordonite,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:49:08 2015 UTC,"Ok this is from someone who has been though the exact situation that you are asking.  You must weigh in two different factors:   First unless you are working for an awesome company with the best health care plan Medi-cal will be less expensive.  It fully covers both the doctor's office co-pays, tests and any prenatal you would be prescribed.  So for cost Medi-Cal would be the better option.  Depending on the coverage ratio of your new plan (80% with a 20% copay for example) Medi-Cal would be even better.  However you will have to weigh this by the reduced choices in doctors and the possible disruption a change of doctor might have on your care.  Medi-Cal has a reduced list of doctors to chose from.  Finding quality doctors is not difficult however and finding ones with small wait times can be done in an afternoon.  You also have a new job and with it (hopefully) added income.  This means that, depending on the time of your income review, your Medi-Cal benefits may be terminated.  So you will need to find a doctor that takes both Medi-Cal and your new insurance to prevent having to find a new doctor or office mid pregnancy.  Again something that is not a major hurdle but just keep it in mind.  At this point you may give the Office the information for both and list Medi-Cal as your primary insurance.    If you are looking for advice I would recommend you find a doctor with Medi-Cal so you can start seeing a doctor as soon as possible.  Keep it for as long as you are able and when canceled switch on over to your new plan.  I would give them only the Medi-Cal information at first to prevent any mishaps were a charge for care was filed with the wrong insurance or even twice (happened to me, office staff are only human)."

California,3apo5d,sanber3584,3,Mon Jun 22 14:15:27 2015 UTC,"Independent of buying a car, once you establish residence in California you will have to obtain a CA DL.    Buying a car should be no problem, especially if you are buying from a private party.  DMV may have an issue when it comes to registering.  Buying from a dealership may be a little harder (please note, I do not know this for a fact) but as long as you show documentation showing that you just moved and/or you are working on you CA DL I think you can make an argument for your case.  Reference: ""New California residents must obtain a California driver's license within 10 days of moving to the state.""  http://www.dmv.org/ca-california/new-to-california.php"
California,3apo5d,spooky760,3,Mon Jun 22 14:36:18 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I guess my concern was that once I apply for a CA license, it probably takes some time to get it in the mail. But on second thought, this shouldn't be a problem, because the DMV will give me a temp license, correct? And I can use that temp license to buy a car/register it at the DMV?"
California,3apo5d,spooky760,2,Mon Jun 22 14:45:30 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  Not sure of the exact process but I do know DMV can print a paper license while your new one is being made.  That, along with photo ID from the previous state and perhaps a rental agreement should prove that you are new to the state and going through the process.    Welcome to CA."

California,3apo5d,sovexing,2,Mon Jun 22 17:40:11 2015 UTC,"No you don't need a state license to buy a car.   You do need insurance to drive the car off the lot though so don't cancel your current policy if you've got one or you'll end up paying for insurance through the dealership (even if it's only temp) and that shit costs a tonne, and the coverage is never enough.   If you don't have a car/insurance now you'll have to bite the bullet with it. If you do, talk to your agent and explain what you're doing, and ask for a referral to an agent in the area you're moving to.   The dealership will deal with getting the car dealt with at the dmv and the dmv will send you your registration and what not in the mail.   I don't know what the regulation is for moves from out of state but I do know that I have ten days from the date of move to inform the dmv of the change of address. I rather imagine it's somewhat similar with out of state moves. You may have to take a written test but you shouldn't have to take a practical."

Not to mention that if he does get the nomination, or comes close to possibly getting it, the Democratic establishment will start attacking him (just like what the Republicans did with Newt Gingrich back in 2012), and there will be a lot of anti-socialist sentiment directed at Bernie Sanders once the general public starts to hear about him.

Firstly we don't necessarily want everyone to be going to college if it is not going to provide some kind of useful skill. More importantly however, is that I feel we need to balance our budget and start reducing our deficit before we start increasing spending any further. If Sanders wants to raise taxes on the wealthy to do so I support that, as well as the no-brainer that profitable corporations shouldn't be paying little to no taxes while the rest of us do.  The issues I disagree with Sanders aside, there are different levels of importance of the issues that he is talking about. Free education, for or against, is not very high on my list to be honest. What is on my list as #1 is money in politics. Sanders has talked about campaign finance reform and overturning Citizens United on many occasions, and that I feel is the most important issue facing the American political scene today. If electing Sanders means we go into debt a little more for free education while we get money out of politics in the process, I say it's a fair trade and then some."

California,3anand,BentAxel,2,Mon Jun 22 20:54:13 2015 UTC,The military and the weapons industry both have heavy footholds in most states. Their budgets are politically bulletproof.

It doesn't even matter if Sanders genuinely wants to do these things -- honestly, he probably does -- they just aren't realistic. The president signs laws, he doesn't write them. When candidates promise specific legislation they set themselves and their supporters up for failure.  Edit: I am so confused by the voting trend on this comment. Not angry, thoroughly confused. Within a few minutes of posting this, it dropped to -5, yet it's slowly climbed back up to the positives in the hours since. Looking through the thread over the day, it seems like every negative comment was doused with downvotes while all the favorable ones skyrocketed.

Bolivia's president is literally a retard. What a hateful cunt. I hope her diesel dyke cellmate fists her to death. Once you take a traditional institution like marriage and just redefine it after thousands of years for the benefit of a tiny-but-loud minority, you render its meaning malleable. And then you're pretty much destined to slide down the slippery slope, with that institution's meaning open to further reinterpretation by other fringe activist groups. And eventually you'll end up with a term that is effectively meaningless. One day, in the not-too-distant future, some guy or gal (probably in Europe) is going to marry an ape. A literal simian. And some EU judge will say that it's okay, because apes are a close relative to humans, and they are sentient, and that the couple can communicate using sign language, so it's consensual and just wonderful.

Cal Poly San Luis Obispo excels in all rankings and is about as prestigious as CSUs get. I'd even put Long Beach and San Diego higher than Pomona, which was originally a branch campus of Cal Poly SLO. As for setting, you'd probably enjoy Pomona's mix of outdoors and urban (the outskirts of LA proper), but SLO is easily one of the coolest cities in the state and the quintessential college town with a lot to offer both downtown and in the greater, more rural, area.  Is there any reason you're looking exclusively at CSUs as opposed to UCs? Mechanical engineering may be best served by the UC system, and you'd really broaden your horizons in terms of campuses by looking at both CSUs and UCs. If you're into outdoorsy stuff but love urban campuses, UC Berkeley is a great choice, but you might like UC Santa Barbara or UC Santa Cruz in the same way you'd like SLO."
California,3aivf8,helloelan,2,Sat Jun 20 18:08:59 2015 UTC,"Pretty much spot on.  SLO is unquestionably the best CSU and SLO is a great town.  As you said, It's 'urban enough' and tons of hiking, etc. in the area.  One of my biggest regrets is choosing to stay local instead of attending SLO.  However, I think you're being a little hard on Cal Poly Pomona too.  Yes, I am biased as a Cal Poly Pomona alum, but there is no way you can rank Long Beach or SDSU (especially SDSU) higher than Pomona in the engineering disciplines.  In industry, a degree from Pomona will definitely command more attention than a degree from those other schools."
California,3aivf8,rex_llama,2,Sat Jun 20 18:37:11 2015 UTC,"We can agree on SLO>Pomona and I think that's important since everyone else here seems to be saying Pomona but forgetting about SLO. I mean, the reality is that all the schools in California are great. No employer is gonna turn away or even favor an SLO student over Pomona unless it's their alma mater.  In terms of engineering I'll take your word on the superiority of Pomona over CSULB and SDSU, I just know these two to come up often in terms of CSU popularity. For the record I have no horse in this game (UCLA) but I've visited SLO and absolutely loved it."

California,3aef73,CapAWESOMEst,6,Fri Jun 19 14:38:35 2015 UTC,"If you look at a map Mountain House sits right outside the Alameda County border. It couldn't be built closer to civilization due to the fact that Alameda County voters in 2000 passed measure D, which created an urban growth boundary (pdf) that made it impossible to build housing anywhere outside tightly controlled zones surrounding the existing towns of Livermore, Dublin and Pleasanton.   Mountain House isn't my cup of tea, but if you're middle class and want a suburban house in a safe area it's one of the few options available anywhere near the Bay Area."
California,3aef73,unpickle,7,Fri Jun 19 15:24:10 2015 UTC,"I support urban growth boundaries if they're accompanied by mandates to build denser development within the boundaries.

The Bay Area has failed to do either, to its detriment.   Personally I'm not a fan of traditional American sprawl but I would be a hypocrite if I advocated the abolition of limitations on density without also decrying urban containment policies that limit sprawl on the periphery.   Take a look at this map of ""lands at risk"" from the Greenbelt Alliance. Obviously they've published it to to get us worried about losing open space to development, but to me it's a dramatic illustration of just how much land around the Bay Area is completely off limits to development.   While I think its wide open spaces are part of what makes the Bay Area great, it's reasonable to ask if perhaps we're hurting ourselves by trying to preserve too much."

Price shoots up to meet demand based on lowered supply, and eventually demand diminishes because people say ""fuck paying that much, I'll eat something that's not bread"".  See the problem here? Should I write it in bold text?  There is literally nothing to drink that is not water or does not have water as a part of its production process. There are no ""not bread"" alternatives, and if you do this poor people will die of thirst.  It's not like I can decide that water is too expensive, and I just won't drink it.

Even if you can squeeze money into being able to drink, you've done it by pushing other necessities of life out of your budget.  You do not realize that this is likely the front-end of a megadrought, which (based on data collected from core samples of trees) can go on for around 30 years. Probably even more than, now that we've drastically changed the environment.  We are already trucking in water in the valley regions of our state. Drive the 101 through the valley, see some of the horror firsthand.    Letting the people with the least amount of stuff shoulder the bulk of the burden is never acceptable, especially when the burden in question is a lack of access to a basic human right.

On the contrary, this may very well be a long drought, in which case we need a sustainable solution. Setting the price at market equilibrium is always sustainable. Rationing is never an acceptable long-term solution. Just ask Venezuela.

I find it funny that this is the assertion you deny, as opposed to the other two.   Do you really think the equilibrium price of water would be 1,000 times what it is today? Yes or no.

If there is anyway you can stay at some altitude for 2 days before beginning your hike, it will help you acclimate. I start to notice the altitude around 8k at rest, and perhaps 5 or 6k for exercise.  By 10k it's a definite factor.   The PCT folks will be sharing the trail with you.  You will recognize these insane people by their scraggly hair, dirty clothes, hungry look, and the fact that they'll hike easily 2-3 times as far as you each day.  They are not actually homeless.

Start easy and then increase your mileage. 20 miles on parts of the Muir trail with a full pack is a lotta work; that could be over 5k of climbing depending on where you are.

""freedom"" is something that can only really be defined by the individual, although I'm assuming you're conservative (in b4 ""moonbeam""), which usually means ""freedom"" = ""no gun restrictions and no taxes"". In that case, go live in Illinois or New York for a while.   California's got a lot of problems, but taxes and ""freedom""?

You are not required to use public aid.  However, I also believe that there needs to be a better child care system in place so those who want to work do not have to spend so much on child care. There are 'refunds' currently, but only up to a point.  There is plenty of trash and dirty alleys that need to be cleaned and instead of just having people claiming (i.e. having someone sign a slip) they tried to get a job, that they are required to at least work three eight hour days, or four six hour days for the state to receive financial aid (unless they have a job already.) So it would be pretty much like mandatory community service to get paid, or as some would call it, a job. This isn't to punish people who need money or work, it is to create a work ethic, work experience, and the satisfaction that they can at least say they earned/worked for the money.

It's cleaner, there's Disneyland. As a big hockey player, there are a number of huge hockey stores to kill a day in, some great breweries and food, nice beaches, and some cool historical places to check out.   I think the reason most LA people hate on it is that it is basically one giant suburb. Anaheim isn't really the ""city"" it's made out to be, there are loads of malls and shopping centers. From the outside, it's just endless stores, homes, and chain restaurants. Like anywhere, you just have to dig a little deeper to find what you are looking for. And yeah, it's spread out, but so is LA. Each city out there has their own thing going on and has its own cool places to see and explore. I think most people that talk badly about it have probably gone to Disneyland, driven through on the 5 and seen all the malls and chain restaurants off the exits, and maybe exited on Katella once for an Angels or Ducks  game or concert, and that's their entire view of Orange County."

California,3aaj58,bnc22,25,Thu Jun 18 17:00:58 2015 UTC,"The hate, especially on Reddit, is mainly related to demographics.  Young people hate on OC because it is a great place for people who have 'settled down' to live.  Some of the best public schools, low crime rate, quiet neighborhoods, a little less traffic than LA County, etc.   At the same time, there are not as many walkable, 'hip', densely populated areas with lots of stuff to do - which are desirable attributes for those who are not 'settled down.'  Also, the conservative reputation of the county plays into the perception.  Yes, there are parts of the county that are still VERY conservative (mainly South OC).  For me, as more of a liberal thinking person, it has really no effect on my day to day life.  Makes me kind of alone in my perspective in some discussions between neighbors and stuff, but my neighbors are awesome despite some of their political views.  I may be a little lucky in that regard.  A lot of this is changing though, slowly but surely.  The GOP only won the county in the last couple presidential elections by a couple percentage points.  The county as a whole is now majority minority.  This is not our grandparents, or even our parents Orange County."
California,3aaj58,shaylenn,8,Thu Jun 18 15:50:03 2015 UTC,"I've lived in Orange County practically my entire life. Garden Grove to be specific. I've never experienced much of what is being said in these posts. I'm pretty socially liberal and so are most of my friends and family. I feel like most of what is being said is about South County which really is different from Central or North County. Chain restaurants? I rarely go to any of them especially when there's so much diverse food in OC! And I love how inexpensive the food is. I've been traveling to San Jose for work for the last 6 months and I've never appreciated OC more. This is what OC is to me:   Lots of great places to eat and most can be relatively inexpensive. I can't emphasize enough how much great food there is in OC. Every weekend I'm home from San Jose, I gorge on all the great food so I can satiate my cravings before having to head back up north.  Parking is usually not a hassle compared to a large metropolitan like LA. And driving is relatively less stressful.  1.5 hours from SD and 1 hour LA makes it easy to get out of the burbs and experience city life in the two different city cultures.  Some beautiful outdoor scenery including beaches and hikes.  Great little pockets of casual nightlife like downtown Santa Ana, Triangle Square in Costa Mesa, or even Main Street Huntington Beach. But if you feel like more, SD and LA are only a hop skip and a jump away. Edit: forgot to add downtown Fullerton and downtown Brea!  Diverse! Little Saigon, Santa Ana, K-town, so many different cultures to experience that you really don't have to leave OC.  There is a culture of flaunting money and I feel like it's rampant across all classes. The middle and poor trying to keep up with the Joneses. This is the biggest thing that bothers me about OC but even though I do know quite a few people like this, they're still good nice people who are pretty left leaning. Although because of this obsessive materialistic flaunting, I feel my generation stays out of politics unfortunately. This leads to the older and/or richer conservatives to vote and determine OC's policies. This makes me the most sad about my beloved County.  Housing is quite expensive but I feel there is a reason people are flocking to OC and compared to San Jose - no contest. San Jose is much more expensive with less to offer. Wish I could love it up here though. They have some beautiful homes and scenery. But I digress.    I feel like a lot of these opinions are either outdated or they're confirmation bias. I'm probably I'm bias myself because I've come to really love and appreciate OC for all that is has to offer. It's also unfair to compare LA to OC. If you live in LA and love it there, great for you! You must love the city life. But don't compare your city life to a suburb and call it worst when I feel like it's just different. In any case, I just wanted to offer my perspective on this county of mine. Talking about all of this is making me crave tortas from Taqueria Tapatia."
California,3aaj58,jimgagnon,20,Thu Jun 18 16:38:14 2015 UTC,"The Orange Curtain is real, but not in such easily quantifiable way such as access to abortion.  It's more subtle in such ways as who's kids are included in play groups and who's included in events.  Also in the types of political rhetoric presented at churches and in discussions with groups.  Depending on where you live, there is less tolerance to minorities and gays and the whole 'driving while black' thing is an issue in some areas.  There are still liberal areas, but there are some very conservative areas.    And no difference in earthquake risk, fyi.  We have our own faults."

California,3aaj58,bnc22,9,Thu Jun 18 15:17:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I almost added ""full of people looking to live in such areas""."
California,3aaj58,eugenesbluegenes,4,Thu Jun 18 15:20:33 2015 UTC,"I don't know if you would call the following cities ""affluent"":   Anaheim Santa Ana Garden Grove  Westminster Tustin Orange Fullerton Brea   I could on but you get the gist of it. I'm sure there are neighborhoods in those cities that could be called affluent but they're small pockets compared to the city itself. I live in Garden Grove and I rarely go to the affluent areas of OC except maybe the South Coast metro area but that's only because of Ikea and Din Tai Fung. Anyway, OC is a suburb so compared to a metropolitan, I'm sure it's definitely boring but please show me a suburb that's just as exciting as a big city and I'll concede my point. I think a lot of OC hate is because people hate suburbs in general, which is an opinion you're definitely entitled to but can't really compare apples to oranges."
California,3aaj58,bnc22,5,Thu Jun 18 15:27:38 2015 UTC,"Median household annual incomes of the cities you listed as of 2013, respectively:  $60k, $53k, $60k, $53k, $74k, $79k, $68k, $82k.   Median household income for the county as a whole was $75k, sixth highest among the 54 CA counties, median household income for California was $61k. So even your examples of less than affluent are still mostly above the median for the state.   Not saying everyone is rich there, but the trend is real. Not sure what you mean about the apples and oranges."
California,3aaj58,eugenesbluegenes,5,Thu Jun 18 20:01:33 2015 UTC,"Income has to be relative to cost of living. You can't say that the cities are affluent just by income. Cost of living, mostly housing is much more expensive compared to California as a whole as well. That doesn't mean the cities are more affluent. Our house is old and not in the greatest neighborhood, but it's worth over 500k. The cost of the house does not make it a really nice house, it's relative to the area. Apples to oranges > comparing big cities to suburbs which many have been comparing LA to OC in this thread.   Edit: you also mentioned that OC is boring so I didn't know boring compared to what? I assumed a big city which is also why I said apples and oranges. Apologies if you just think it's boring compared to Alameda County which I know nothing about."
California,3aaj58,ferae_naturae,0,Thu Jun 18 20:34:23 2015 UTC,"I see, so I guess Marin isn't affluent either, since you have to account for cost of living and the housing is expensive because of all the rich people living there.   Oh wait, was that a circle I just went in?   Say what you will about a judgement of boring (the things that make it boring for some make it attractive for others), but Orange county largely consists of relatively affluent suburbs.   And when you're talking about why someone doesn't like apples, maybe it makes sense to compare them to oranges."
California,3aaj58,rocky6501,0,Thu Jun 18 20:48:34 2015 UTC,Kind of like a cross between Valley of the Dolls and Donnie Darko.  It's WASPie and full of dark suburban secrets.
California,3aaj58,ferae_naturae,20,Thu Jun 18 21:01:18 2015 UTC,"The cultures are by and large very different. Of course they are both very diverse places, but there are a number of stark differences that I can at least perceive. I am from the Inland Empire, which is still different in its own way. I have lived in the city of LA for almost 20 years. I have a lot of family and friends in OC and have spent a lot of time there.   Yes, they are all very ""spread out,"" but I think it depends on what part of the city of LA you are talking about. LA is very dense in its city proper. It is constantly cranking with activity. The neighborhoods are constantly turning over and recycling themselves into something new. I don't perceive this happening as much in OC. To some degree, in the older parts like Santa Ana, Anaheim, Fullerton, I personally perceive that happening. Revitalization, new industries popping up, etc. The rest of the places tend to stay kind of sleepy bedroom communities, or if you head south and west to the coast, it is pretty much the same beach community it has been for a long time, except it just keeps getting more affluent with time. With that, as I see it, it gets whiter and less off-kilter. Which brings me to the next perception I have.  The racial, cultural, economic divides in OC are very visible, and their government/law enforcement/special interests/etc. work very hard to keep it that way. One thing you notice just driving around OC is that there are cinderblock walls everywhere. The housing tracts are all turned inward, away from the world. Sure, that provides some modicum of safety or whatever, but I think it represents something psychological, too. I.e., there's one way to do things in life, and its the way I've done it in my cinderblock castle; the other ways are weird to me, and I choose to either ignore them or do something to crush them on days that I am angry. That's the message I get from that anyway. So you see these strange movements of, for example, Latino cultural expression and advancement in the old core while at the same time all sorts of anti-immigrant stories popping up in the news, and sudden shake downs on Mexican street vendors. Or the segregation of the Latino quarters from the ""arts district."" This is a constant conflict, and you can see it in the OC Weekly. The Latino issue is a big one, but it is actually just one of many.  Another related observation is the religiousness. Sure, LA has its religions, especially weird ones like Scientology. And there are huge Jewish communities. Our perception outside of OC is that it has a huge Evangelical contingent. Couple that with the conservative republican image, and you have something that is starkly different from the culture of Los Angeles. This is actually very interesting, because the perception of CA from outside, generally, is that its this cute, liberal, smug, farty arty place by the sea. That is more accurate if you are talking generically about SF and LA, but, from my experience as an IE native, and as a 4th generation California, a  lot of CA, outside of these seaside metroplexes is pretty similar culturally to the rest of the southwest and the midwest. People are generally still pretty religious and very working class and conservative. They're also pretty segregated. There are white parts of town, and there are the non-white parts of town. Of course it is much more of a spectrum, but its a big state, and LA and SF, in my opinion, are cultural exceptions to the rest of CA. OC has its own quirks in this regard, but I totally get it and relate to it.  Again, its not really that constructive to broadly generalize these things. OC is very diverse, and the population is, too. Things are constantly in flux, and demographics are shifting. But maybe those ideas will help.  I apologize in advance for my lack of expertise on these things. I'm just a layman trying to help. Cheers."

California,3aaj58,KennyGardner,15,Thu Jun 18 19:00:17 2015 UTC,"Orange County is very successful and a desirable place to live. Los Angeles County is, too. What you are seeing is just rivalry.  I grew up in L.A. proper and I lived in Orange County for years. I learned that many O.C. residents do not like to be associated with L.A. at all.  In Vegas, one of the first questions you get when you're sitting around with people you don't know playing blackjack is, ""where are you in from?"" If I found out someone was from Orange County, I'd say, ""Oh yeah, I've heard of that, isn't that part of L.A.?"" With eyes sparking and ears spewing smoke, the reaction was always ""NO, IT'S NOT L.A., IT'S ORANGE COUNTY, IT'S DIFFERENT."" (This was infinitely more fun before ""The O.C."" show which basically put Orange County on the map for the rest of the U.S.)  So my interpretation is that basically O.C. residents distance themselves from any association with L.A. and that is the fundamental reason for any rivalry between the two.

California,3aaj58,teh__sukc,11,Thu Jun 18 15:21:29 2015 UTC,"The answer is simple, and not a lot of people here are addressing it. Wealth.  Orange County has a population of about 3 million, with a per capita income of about $34k  LA county has a population of about 9.8 million and a per capita income of about $28k  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_locations_by_income  Orange County as a symbol represents wealthy people's desire to live only with other wealthy people. The stereotype of people who live in Orange County is super wealthy, living in a bubble, with no idea (nor respect for) what life is like for people outside their bubble. This may not reflect reality exactly, but like any stereotype is based on at least a modicum of truth.  LA County may have lots of wealthy individuals, but it also has a lot of people in the opposite category. LA is more connected with Hollywood, so if there is any similarity to how people feel it would be that celebrities and those in the movie business also have no idea what life is like outside of their affluent filmmaking bubble.  Orange County politics is more centered around affluence than around conservatism (although the two things overlap considerably). It's more of a ""protect my money first, and your rights second"" mindset. Less of a ""I don't want someone to get an abortion"" and more of a ""I don't want poor people living in my neighborhood, driving down the value of my home""."

California,3aaj58,walkedoff,2,Fri Jun 19 00:08:17 2015 UTC,"I did my undergrad at UC Irvine and I have a few things to say about Orange County:  Firstly speaking about the City of Irvine; there's nothing to do there. There's no nightlife, no downtown (only shopping centers), I heard that a coffee shop that regularly hosted an open-mic night was forced to shut down due to noise complaints. Everything closes relatively early for a university town (at around 10 or 11). Its a rich place where a large Asian population lives.  Getting away from that though, theres the coastal areas and the more inland areas; Newport, Balboa, HB, and Santa Ana, Fulleton, Anaheim. The coastal zones are still insanely rich and I feel like I stand out and don't fit in some places. Mostly rich White and Asian people driving their expensive-ass cars. Moving inland, its much more friendly. Mexican food is everywhere! Culture! (none of this was present at UCI or Irvine itself). Mostly Mexicans here (Santa Ana).  What I think the problem that LA people have with the OC is that its a unfamiliar place with unfamiliar people. The OC is clean, very safe, VERY conservative; almost an opposite of LA. It's a completely different world in the rich areas. Some of the inland places are very relateable to the LA crowd, I think."

But Orange County takes it to a whole new level. They think that not only are they the best at everything, but that everyone else is doing everything wrong by not trying to emulate them. Orange County thinks it's the center of the universe, and tends to build itself into a bubble and remain totally out of touch with the rest of the world.  It's the kind of people who go to a restaurant and slam it on Yelp because they don't make the same food as the restaurant by their house.

California,3a9ecb,barrinmw,-2,Thu Jun 18 15:49:55 2015 UTC,Article 1 section four of the constitution says: free exercise and enjoyment of religion without discrimination or preference are guaranteed.   Not allowing parent to exercise their religion without discrimination in public schools kinda violates their rights.  Article 9 section 5 days that the legislature will provide a system of common free schools.   Article 1 section 1 says that we have an inalienable right to privacy. State knowledge of vaccination status violates that.
California,3a9ecb,nmhunate,3,Thu Jun 18 15:48:47 2015 UTC,"Article I of the Constitution sets up the Legislative Branch -- the House and Senate. And it consists of seven articles in total. Assuming you meant Amendment, though, here's what the first one says:   Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.   Look at that first word carefully. And think about it... ever applied for a private scholarship, for example? How is it that applicants have to meet requirements like being descended from one of the [i]Mayflower[/i]'s passengers, or play a sport at varsity level, or be left-handed? Because the scholarships in question aren't from the government. Awarding them doesn't require an act of Congress, and a private citizen doesn't need permission from the government to give or sell their private property.   Another example: private universities -- some are overtly religious, some are not. Some receive funding directly from a parent organization -- and students who are members of that organization might be paying a lower tuition than ""non-member"" students (BYU comes most readily to mind). Isn't that religious discrimination? Sure. They're religious institutions, funded by religious organizations.  So. Public schools? They're funded by...? Local and property taxes, bonds, even a state's lottery. That means that when you send your kid to a public school, that school's funding comes, in part, from you. Here's the other part: attendance. That's why truancy is such a big deal, because if a kid's marked absent and that absence isn't excusable (illness, bereavement, etc), that's money the school doesn't get. More importantly, that's education the kid misses out on. A day missed here, a day missed there, that's not so hard to catch up on. But a week? Two weeks? Three? How about months? Is your right to keep your kid from learning -- that'd be your own private matter, your own beliefs, whatever -- is that really what you want to champion?  State knowledge of vaccination status means either your kid can attend or not, and by the way -- who paid for the vaccination? State health plan? Special vaccination clinic arranged between a local provider and... the school district? Say it's paid for by private insurance. That private insurance company then has your vaccination status information -- along with plenty more. And as a private company, guess what? Your information is their property.  Still not coming up with anything about privacy itself being a constitutional right, by the way. Which I guess is why the topic's been so hotly contested in recent years -- I mean, if it had been so clearly laid out in the first place, there'd be nothing to debate, would there?"

California,3a61ge,cardifan,52,Wed Jun 17 14:40:48 2015 UTC,"The title of this thread says this ruling will nuke the company, which it won't. If Uber loses its appeal, the ruling still only applies to California, and it's not going to kill the company, just force it to reconsider its business model. Personally, I think their business model borders on abusive for their drivers, and this ruling was a step in the right direction for labor regulations in the state. If one of their drivers were to get injured in a serious accident while driving for Uber, as an independent contractor, the driver is not eligible for workers' compensation coverage, meaning they'd only get their medical expenses and vehicle damage covered, but not their lost wages. It's a scheme that saves Uber millions by shifting the risk of injury to their employees."
California,3a61ge,splash27,26,Wed Jun 17 17:39:04 2015 UTC,"It's not a ""scheme"", they're independent contractors. This is how it works for independent contractors in every other industry (source: I'm an independent contractor). Most of their business plan revolves around skirting existing taxi laws (which is good, that keeps the price down), not screwing over their drivers. Also keep in mind that Uber makes no effort to hide the fact that their drivers are not actual employees.   No other contractors receive worker's comp or any other benefits, why are people just now realizing that Uber drivers are getting shafted? Further, why are Uber drivers the only ones being talked about here? 30-40% of our workforce is made up of independent contractors. Seems awfully ridiculous to say a part time Uber driver should receive full benefits while a freelance web designer can continue paying out the ass, don't you think?  edit: after thinking about this some more, I agree with the ruling. While I do think it's being made under the wrong pretense (that being that local governments are trying to recover tax/license losses from taxis), it's definitely a step in the right direction for worker's rights. At a time when labor and workers are valued as little as they are, I should fully support any legal win for them, and this is one of them. Hopefully this can bring attention to the tens of millions of others who are also considered independent contractors."

I'll change my opinion when everyone is advocating for these changes across the board, but I believe this is mainly a measure to reign-in these services that are ""destroying"" the taxi industry. States and cities make lots of money from taxis and they want to continue making that money.

I don't feel I have enough knowledge or experience on the topic of independent contractors and labor laws to write an effective article or essay, but I'm definitely experiencing some cognitive dissonance here in regards to these labor laws and classification of independent contractors. On the one hand, I think independent contracting is laid out pretty well and is a pretty straightforward process. On the other hand, I think worker rights in this state and country are about a hundred years behind where they should be. Now that I think about it, I'm actually embarrassed to have even slightly argued against this as I really base most of my beliefs in the power of people and not businesses.   I think if companies are weaseling around labor laws (like Uber's business model clearly is), they should have to pay for things like worker's comp. I'm not sure how something like that would apply to independent contractors like me who do work for various companies and don't have a big franchise/umbrella company hanging over me like Uber (and clearly that's why this ruling wouldn't apply), but I sure would love to not pay half of what I earn towards stuff like this (or suffer the consequences of having no job should I get injured while working)."

California,3a61ge,unceunceunce,3,Wed Jun 17 20:49:36 2015 UTC,"As you pointed out, not every business model involving independent contractors is abusive, but Uber's is. The reason Uber drivers are the only ones being talked about is because that's what the news pertains to. The construction industry is also full of companies hiring independent contractors to keep business expenses down for the lead developer. The agricultural industry also uses contractors so that the big ag companies can avoid liability by claiming they don't know their field workers are illegal immigrants. Using contractors also helps companies avoid liability when their employees get injured or killed on the job: a construction worker might be ordered to do something on the job by a boss who technically works company A that hired the worker's company B that results in him becoming permanently disabled. If the worker had also worked for company A, he could file an employment lawsuit saying his boss's negligence contributed to his injury, but because he actually works for company B, he has fewer options for recourse."
California,3a61ge,splash27,0,Wed Jun 17 18:52:11 2015 UTC,"That's the fault of the contractor really.

A more effective option would be to require contractors to purchase adequate coverage."
California,3a61ge,MZITF,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:16:51 2015 UTC,"It's not like workers comp insurance and other benefits are unavailable to contractors   Technically, workers' comp isn't available to independent contractors, because that type of insurance is only for companies with employees, and independent contractors are considered business owners, not employees for that purpose. In California, business owners and independent contractors can get ""Elective Coverage SDI"" (EC) which is paying to be a part of the state disability program (SDI), or they can choose a private disability insurance plan. Disability helps to cover lost wages, but contractors still need to pay their own medical expenses, unlike workers' comp, which covers both the medical and the lost wages (which can be helpful when medical costs are higher than the worker's regular health insurance maximum benefit). The EC premiums cost 3.9% of the independent contractor's yearly ""profits"", but the coverage doesn't kick in for 6 months and can't be cancelled for two years (workers' comp coverage starts your first day on the job).  A decent alternative to EC for independent contractors would be private disability insurance through group plans likes these from the Freelancers Union (which provides up to two years of disability payments if you can't do your job, or payments up to age 65 if you can't do any job), but it too has a probation period before a claim can be filed, unlike workers' comp. For people who are only temporarily disabled, workers' compensation has higher payments (2/3 of the average salary) than the private insurance I cited, but workers' comp provides lower payments (max of $290/wk) for people who are permanently disabled; the private disability insurance pays 50% of the workers' average salary. Regular employees who become disabled while on the job can be paid both workers' comp and SDI, but contractors injured on the job only get coverage under either the state's EC SDI or a private disability plan."

Contractor will receive payment equivalent to 40% of fare in addition to their regularly contracted fare rate for providing services during high demand periods as determined by our software algorithms, and will be notified of this incentive program on a weekly basis."" The driver is free to set their own hours, but in practice, they might only ever make a decent profit if they work during the specified hours that the computer algorithms determine are more valuable to Uber.

Uber and Lyft also fought against new regulations requiring them to provide insurance coverage for the ""gap"" time when drivers have the app on but haven't yet picked up a customer; they would have preferred to make their drivers pay for that additonal coverage themselves.

California,3a61ge,Knute5,3,Wed Jun 17 21:33:46 2015 UTC,It's extensively used in most major cities worldwide. It's incredibly highly adopted.
California,3a61ge,Mulsanne,-2,Wed Jun 17 23:00:24 2015 UTC,So is Yellow Taxi. $50B? (bubble alert)
California,3a61ge,Knute5,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:48:38 2015 UTC,"I don't know, are any of the CA Cab companies state wide, national or even international?  I don't know of any other transport companies in that segment that have as wide adoption around the world as Uber. Uber competes with thousands of fragmented taxi companies in each jurisdiction.  I mean, you just admitted you had no idea what's going on here, don't you think you're being rash to rush to call it a bubble? It's valued at $50B based on the funds they were able to raise which was based on an evaluation of their financials. You'd be hard pressed to find another company in the entire world which is has grown significantly faster than Uber."
California,3a61ge,Mulsanne,0,Thu Jun 18 13:47:43 2015 UTC,"$50B. Just let that sink in. Fifty billion dollars... I get the brand, the first-to-market, the disruption of the old model. Sure.

California,3a61ge,Knute5,3,Wed Jun 17 22:42:31 2015 UTC,Startup values are stupidly over inflated. There are a few articles predicting a start up bubble. I'm not sure how true it is but start up are stupidly inflated in value.
California,3a61ge,urmyheartBeatStopR,4,Wed Jun 17 20:57:23 2015 UTC,"This company is miles past being a ""start up"""
California,3a61ge,Mulsanne,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:32:52 2015 UTC,"That's debatable.  It haven't gone public and have several venture capitalist backing.  From where I'm coming from it's still a start up, it haven't went public IIRC.  Most tech startup get venture capitalist to invest in them with a series of rounds. When they go public with their IPO and such that's when venture capitalists sell most if not all of their stocks to gain their investment back.  Since they're still a private company with backings and last I've read they're still asking for more seed rounds from venture capitalist.  This, in the tech world is still considered a start up.     also since they haven't gone public this is how they get over inflated value. I would still consider them a start up since they're relatively new. I know facebook took a while to go public like wise with google. During private mode they stopped needing funding and had some sort of revenue generating. I think at this point is where the company is established and I would consider not a startup."
California,3a61ge,urmyheartBeatStopR,5,Thu Jun 18 00:34:23 2015 UTC,"Since when do you have to go public to not be considered a start up? What a ridiculous definition.  My 10 year old company just got a new round of funding from venture capitalists, and it is no where close to a start up in any manner. Another ridiculous criteria."
California,3a61ge,TocTheEternal,4,Thu Jun 18 00:40:06 2015 UTC,What a joke. Always ask yourself a simple question: cui bono? Who benefits?  The drivers? They are now unable to earn extra income in a situation they voluntarily entered into.  Uber? They will now have to fire tons of people and maybe go out of business.   The average people who need reliable and cheap rides? Fucked.  Taxi and livery drivers interest groups? Ding!
California,3a61ge,TheJucheisLoose,4,Thu Jun 18 15:19:21 2015 UTC,You're literally suggesting that we should not be able to voluntarily and willfully (keywords) enter into a contractual working agreement with someone.
California,3a61ge,Super_Natant,-5,Wed Jun 17 21:43:27 2015 UTC,"Oh not this idiotic argument again.  ""Unions got us the 40 hour workweek 70 years ago, so you are never allowed to critically examine the economic impact of organized labor for the rest of time.""  Sure, and Teddy Roosevelt, a republican, busted the shit out of unethical trusts and monopolies, and Ulysses S. Grant, a republican, authorized the creation of the first national park, so I take it you vote republican now, as a result?  Read a history book, right?    I suggest you read an economics textbook to learn about the actual effect organized labor has on American labor markets."
California,3a61ge,Super_Natant,-1,Thu Jun 18 00:41:15 2015 UTC,"The point is, we must still critically examine labor as it relates to the economy without blindly accepting one position over another based on concessions which were fought for and achieved 70-100 years ago.   Labor laws, benefits, break times etc were granted in response to overwhelmingly abysmal working conditions, like twelve hours in a coal mine at age 15 with no breaks for 60 hours a week abysmal.  Comparing this to the working conditions of an Uber driver is fucking laughable.   Characterizing the conditions (in ones own car, for however long one wants, whenever they want) that an Uber driver faces on a daily basis as a condition for blindly accepting historical positions on ""labor"" make about as much sense as blindly accepting a radical republican's position on environmental protection in 1867.    That is, none."

California,3a61ge,splash27,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:34:21 2015 UTC,"Clearly not. Contractors negotiate their fee with their client and their deliverables are well defined.    Paying a shift worker as a contractor typically fails to survive judicial review. Otherwise McDonalds would pay per customer served rather this by the hour.  Uber employees can be commissioned per job, but that's on top of base salary required by law."

California,3a61ge,Super_Natant,4,Thu Jun 18 04:02:22 2015 UTC,"A bunch of companies have gotten in trouble for using unpaid interns. You're also not allowed to volunteer for a for-profit company, only a non-profit. You can't just put all volunteers in the same category. Sure, I'd volunteer for a cause I support, but if my boss at a for-profit company says he'd like me to start volunteering to work an extra hour a day so that they don't have to lay me off and hire someone cheaper, I might not have a choice but to accept that shitty arrangement if it weren't clearly illegal."
California,3a61ge,splash27,-1,Thu Jun 18 04:14:04 2015 UTC,"You can't just put all volunteers in the same category.   This is your arbitrary assignment, and that's the point. This shitty Labor Commision decision is going to put a shit ton of contracted workers into a particular category against the voluntary will of those workers.  This is not really any different from, for example, preventing a non-profit from using volunteers for unpaid labor.  Unfair labor practices are unfair labor practices, no matter the intention of the employer.   You can't randomly pick and choose what's ""fair"" and ""unfair"" when it comes to labor laws, or else you get random, arbitrary laws that prevent labor mobility (connecting people who want to work with people who want to hire them), which stifles the economy.    We then argue in part E that removing obstacles to geographical mobility and simultaneously undertaking pro-competition reforms in the goods market could be a beneficial mix, as these measures each reinforce the other’s positive effect. Wage flexibility, notably regional wage flexibility, would also ease the convergence of labour markets."
California,3a61ge,Super_Natant,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:13:25 2015 UTC,"This is not really any different from, for example, preventing a non-profit from using volunteers for unpaid labor   It's more like determining that an organization organized as a non-profit was operating in a manner where they should have been designated a for-profit, and that their use of unpaid labor was unjustified--the consequences of the decision are significant and controversial, but there is merit basis for the decision.   If Uber wants to classify their workers as independent contractors, then clearly there are aspects of their relationship with their workers that need to be shored up for them to do so.  In the Uber ruling the labor commission noted that Uber exercises control over their drivers tools (not allowed in an independent contractor relationship) by specifying age requirements for the vehicles they use and requiring them to be registered with Uber. Uber also permits their drivers to hire employees, but those people aren't allowed to call themselves Uber drivers, use the app, or display the Uber logo unless they're registered with Uber, which is essentially controlling how their contractors conduct their businesses (not allowed in an independent contractor relationship)."

If you're covered there, the procedure's essentially the same, differing only in that a number of companies are moving away from paper applications in favor of having them online, so you'd do most of your legwork in your current position. The drawback is that it doesn't give you the chance to establish any rapport with whoever is in charge of hiring, so you'd want to call the place, ostensibly to ""make sure my application was received,"" that ""everything's in order with it"" -- things like that (which are really just an excuse for getting them to look at your application and associating it with a person)."
California,3a9gzo,skyblueandblack,1 point,Thu Jun 18 08:14:49 2015 UTC,"I can prove, and I've had some experiences with online applications, but since I have no US phone that went down.

California,3a9gzo,harmless11,5,Thu Jun 18 08:19:19 2015 UTC,"... Nope. The store might've been out of applications, I suppose, or whoever you talked to was doing a bad job of telling you the application is online (or whoever you talked to wasn't paying attention, was lazy, or was just plain stupid -- always possibilities, after all). If anyone tells you that you're supposed to pay to apply someplace, ask to speak to their manager (and stick around, because it's likely that place will need to hire someone... =D ).  No US phone... oh, for them to call you back? Google has a feature called Google Voice, and I think you can use it as a voicemail service even without an actual phone -- like, it'll assign a phone number that people can call to leave you a message, which you can then listen to or read a transcript of. I'm not 100% certain, since I only used it as my voicemail service (instead of AT&T's), but hey, take a look and see."
