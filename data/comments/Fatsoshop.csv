Fatsoshop,3cpqjj,Eel28,3,Fri Jul 10 00:26:54 2015 UTC,Her hips didn't look as broken as her face; I did it mostly for the awful teeth and then just sort of fixed the whole head without focusing on the body. Didn't want to mess too much with u/FlameAwait's work.

Fatsoshop,39djfn,Smelly_Skeptic,7,Thu Jun 11 07:56:15 2015 UTC,"If you don't mind OP, I have a few tips for those in the comments. If you do mind, I'll edit this all away.  To those of you just starting...  A fat person's belly button gets pushed away from its proper location so it sags at all times. You must copy and paste it back into place.   Even the shoulders get fat, it's not obvious but it makes a difference.  When a fat person is laying back like that, the fat in its face slides toward the back of the face near the ears and hairline. This creates a thinner looking face, which means you (usually) don't have to do as much because they did some of the work for you."
Fatsoshop,39djfn,FlameAwait,2,Fri Jun 12 05:11:02 2015 UTC,photoshop is a helluva drug
Fatsoshop,39djfn,Shaojack,2,Thu Jun 11 12:02:22 2015 UTC,This photoshop freaks me out slightly... Her upper arm / armpit area fat looks really weird in the photoshop one... Plus her legs look uncomfortably weird.... Not a HAES person by any means or a fatty.. Just felt like I'd get some comments saying I was. I just really think the photoshopped one is creepy looking

Fatsoshop,39ac06,frankgrice,3,Thu Jun 11 00:09:20 2015 UTC,you can fix hair color but it's a pain to do.
Fatsoshop,38mql0,drink_some_water,10,Fri Jun 5 05:30:59 2015 UTC,Hey this looks pretty good. It might be my imagination but I swear she looks a little midgety in the 2nd one though. I think the legs and hands are too big still.   Do fat people get bigger hands too? Didn't realize there even was any fat in a person's hand.
Fatsoshop,38mql0,deadbeard,3,Fri Jun 5 06:07:42 2015 UTC,It might be my imagination but I swear she looks a little midgety in the 2nd one though.   I think her shoulder's slightly too low. It's more convincing than most fatoshops though (it's so easy to get stuck in uncanny valley).
