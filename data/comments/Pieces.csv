Pieces,3ccur5,Psilocybear,4,Mon Jul 6 22:37:21 2015 UTC,You should consider tilting the piece back while you hit it. In the video you can see only the rear part of the perc firing and this is whats tends to happen if a showerhead perc is not flat. Tilting the peice back will also put more water over the downstem for better diffusion.

Pieces,3a54ds,jfeofhoie,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:35:53 2015 UTC,Awesome if ya want cheap glass that isn't properly made. The only nice thing is that it is cheap. Ya get what ya pay for.
Pieces,3a54ds,Koalchamber,2,Wed Jun 17 14:56:38 2015 UTC,"i couldnt disagree more.  china is a huge place and dhgate offers products from many different sellers.  if you are savvy and check reviews from FC and know who the top sellers/blowers are you can get unbelievable pieces for unreal prices.  sure there are not great sellers w/low quality goods on there, but dont order from them.  its like ebay, buy from the good sellers.  just do some research.  you will not regret it.  i recently got the fc 1000 matrix pillar from steven for $70....  this thing is on par with american glass no doubt.  times are changing...  need to keep up!"
Pieces,3a54ds,jfeofhoie,-1,Wed Jun 17 16:30:01 2015 UTC,"Talk to american glass blowers and they will explaine it to ya. Glass requires time. Thats why pieces sell for what they do. No one is gonna discount their time to sell you a cheap piece. So they use cheaper supplies and tend to spend less time annealing their glass, and like alot of chinese products, pay their workers very poorly. Who wants to produce quality when quantity is what gets you those pennies. Ya get what ya pay for."
Pieces,3a54ds,Koalchamber,-3,Wed Jun 17 16:37:52 2015 UTC,"gonna have to call ur bullshit, bro.  american glass is waaaay overpriced from the specialty labels.  ur thinking is old thinking.  there are blowers directly working with american consumers on the FC cheap bubbler thread designing very sick pieces for great prices.  ive ordered a few and have been blown away.  if you wanna pay $1000 for a mothership/mobious/sov, go ahead.  i'm sure they love it!  paying that much for glass is something i will never do.  for a top vaporizer, that is a different story."

The only thing I can guess is all of the packages come over and a big ass container, that container get scanned then all of the shipping codes get updated. Then that big ass container goes to like Texas to get emptied and sorted and then recent everywhere else. But that was with car parts. Big stuff like seats or dashboards."
