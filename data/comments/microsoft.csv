microsoft,3e3lfz,SecksAwhnThuhBeech,16,Tue Jul 21 18:17:02 2015 UTC,"Love this concept, but I really hate Micro HDMI (still no clue why they went with it on the Surface RT and Surface 2). Mini DisplayPort is a far better option for video-out (license-free, higher resolutions, more standard and widespread). That said, for a high-end phone it might be best to just skip ahead to USB Type-C."
microsoft,3e3lfz,CaptainStack,3,Tue Jul 21 18:45:31 2015 UTC,"It was useful in the past and still currently, but Mini DisplayPort and USB Type-C would be much better options and much more future proof - though HDMI has a lot of future-proofing in it already with spare wires built in.  I guess it's just a safe choice until a single ""standard"" is chosen, ala Blueray or DVD-HD, but with cables adapting from anything to anything, I don't think it would matter too much.  Being a fan concept only, they could have gone with USB Type-C, would have been more exciting.  I have a Micro HDMI output on my BlackBerry Z10 phone (very useful) and on my ASUS T300 Chi Windows 8 tablet (extremely useful).  They're great, but USB Type-C would be ideal."
microsoft,3e3lfz,Robert_Walker,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:35:02 2015 UTC,"Why would you say Mini DisplayPort is good? I dislike it heavily because there isn't a single screen that I've seen that accepts Mini DisplayPort. Maybe some of the higher end computer monitors, but no TVs and no lower non-expensive 1080p monitors. So I end up having to do a Mini DisplayPort to HDMI adapter anyways.  USB Type-C is the future though. Bring on the future!"
microsoft,3e3lfz,BrettGilpin,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:31:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah so you're right that displays don't typically have Mini DisplayPort on them, but here's the thing, they don't really have Micro HDMI on them either, and small devices need a small port.  So, you either need a dongle or an HDMI-to-mini-something cable in most cases.  First, let's just talk HDMI vs DisplayPort. Both transmit video and audio and very high resolutions. However, DisplayPort allows slightly higher resolutions, and allows you to ""daisy chain"" devices together. Also, HDMI is proprietary technology, so a device manufacturer has to pay a royalty to include it on their machine, which means a more expensive device.   Basically, DisplayPort is better, cheaper, and more open. However, HDMI is the standard for TV and TV peripherals and has been very well supported by monitors, so it's a great port to have, and it's way more widespread than DisplayPort (hopefully that changes someday).  However, when we get into mini-port territory, you basically are going to need a dongle to connect to a TV or monitor since none have mini anything. Well, Mini DisplayPort is far more common than Micro HDMI, probably mostly because of Apple's dedication to it. In fact, Mini DisplayPort I'm pretty sure is a lot more common than full-sized DisplayPort and sacrifices no features or quality, so really full sized DisplayPort should just die. If you look online, it's way easier to find dongles from Mini DisplayPort to [anything] than Micro HDMI to [anything].  In short, I'd say if you were going to rank video-out ports that you'd want to have I'd put them in this order:   HDMI Mini DisplayPort VGA [Everything below this point I hate and think should die] Full sized DisplayPort Micro HDMI DVI"

microsoft,3e3lfz,ImplementOfWar2,3,Tue Jul 21 21:44:32 2015 UTC,Lumia's have Snapdragon CPU's and Surfaces would have Intel CPU's?  Other then the stylus I don't see any other difference in the two.  That mini keyboard would be a gimmick imo.  You would have to put your phone on a table or something to use it.  Phones are meant to be operated by your hands.   A better idea would be to make an optional full sized keyboard that had a docking station on it to charge your phone and connect it to a monitor for continuum.

Windows 10 Pro users will have a little flexibility; they'll be able to switch from the mainstream release to the Current Branch for Business (CBB). This will give some control over when updates are deployed. While the CBB will essentially track the consumer release, it will allow feature updates to be held back for some amount of time; Anderson quotes a Microsoft executive saying that companies will have around eight months to prepare for each new feature update. Delay the feature update any further and they'll also be prevented from receiving security updates.

Even a non-malicious bad update could leave hundreds of millions of computers unable to boot.  A stance against the NSA is just PR since U.S. companies can be bound and gagged.

microsoft,3dttwc,MystK,8,Mon Jul 20 05:34:28 2015 UTC,"There are two massive issues with this that I have encountered that nobody here has addressed yet. They're related.   The first is that the automatic update system also updates drives. Windows Update refused to let me use a more stable older graphics driver. It kept replacing it with a newer one, and through two different mechanisms. This is particularly a problem for me because my GPU no longer gets any more updates, so the older driver that I know works better will always be the best one.   So what's the solution to all of this? You have to disable Windows auto-installing drivers. It does this even if you don't have Windows Update set to automatically install. Luckily there is a button that does this easily. This is a whole other layer of auto-installing that you have to disable first. You then have to remember temporarily to re-enable this any time you plug in some new piece of hardware, and then go through the hassle of reinstalling the older driver when you're done.  Okay. So now we got rid of the driver auto-install. Now we have to deal with Windows Update. It will replace drivers as well. Great. So how is that fixed?  Well normally one would just ""Hide"" the update individually in Windows Update and the problem would go away. But you can't do that in Windows 10. Home users are 100% fucked in this scenario. Windows Update will indefinitely replace the older one. Nothing seems to work short of hacky workarounds like disabling the Windows Update service or making files read only.  What about Windows 10 Pro? That's the second issue. In Pro you can defer updates so there is some control, but you can only defer them as a whole, not individually. That's not good enough. This means that if I want to keep that graphics driver I'll have to forego ALL security updates. Any time I want to get security updates I'll have to go through the hassle of having the newer shittier driver installed by Windows Update, then I'll have to defer updates again, remove the newer driver, then reinstall the older driver. What a pain in the ass. There's no chance I'll be doing regular security updates with that in the way.  Are there workarounds? There are those hacky workarounds like making specific files read-only. Microsoft also released a utility that blocks specific driver updates, but it doesn't work with the latest builds anymore. Hopefully there will be a replacement for that in the future.  I had to spend hours figuring out how to prevent Windows from replacing a good driver, and the only official solution I found does not work anymore. I'm assuming Microsoft will eventually update that utility.   I understand why Microsoft did what they did. I 100% support automatic security and feature updates. I'm slightly apprehensive about the driver updates as there is room for error like I'm encountering, but I do think it's a good idea in general.  What I don't think is a good idea is taking away all methods of control away (aside from that downloaded utility). Why isn't there a registry/group policy option to disable automatic driver updates for those who need it? I'm not even talking about security or feature updates. Just driver updates. 90% of people never mess around with things like the group policy editor/registry. Why was even control over drivers taken out? It just seems brainless to me."
microsoft,3dttwc,forestcollector,3,Sun Jul 19 19:03:45 2015 UTC,"I also had a machine that Windows Update put a worse driver on than was available.  My desktop has an nVidia GTX 660 in it. What I had to do was uninstall the driver from the device manager, download and install the previous one from nVidia's website, then wait for Windows to re-update that driver to the worse one again, then roll back the driver.  It was inconvenient to have to do that, but I got my cursor displaying correctly again, and I haven't had any problems after that.  I've also sent that experience to Microsoft via the feedback app.  It's just worth noting that my computer didn't break because of this update and I was able to get it working to my satisfaction."

The point is, most ""incompatibility"" issues and bugs with updates are supposed to be a thing of the past. Will there be issues with updates? Of fucking course! There always have an will be, but they are taking strides to make sure they're occurring as little as possible. This is a big reason they've abandoned trouble causing software and apps (ie silverlight) and gone to platforms and programs they know work.   It's not necessarily Microsoft taking control away from the end user, it's them making sure the idiot who turns off their updates, ""because they cause problems and I know a lot about computers!""

I suspect it's probably also covered in the US constitution.  And the terms of an EULA are not legally enforceable unless you've agreed to them prior to purchase, so I could theoretically install Windows and modify it to disable forced updates if I choose to do so.  Can you give me a decent reason why removing the ability to disable updates would be better than simply setting automatic updating to be the default option?  Malware doesn't seem like a reasonable answer, because malware could still easily disable updating by blocking Microsofts update servers in the hosts file, amongst other methods. So it's not likely to do much to prevent botnets.  It seems to me that it's simply an attempt by Microsoft to take more control away from the end user, and it could quite easily be abused to force crapware (the Bing bar for example) onto peoples computers.

A lot of updates are small though until you get the giant rollup packs if you were to roll back or need a ton of them. For example, the latest out-of-band update was under 650k.

For home users?  Fine.  For people that don't do anything more than surf the web and check their Facebrick account?  Fine.  For professionals -- especially for developers -- this is just a horrible, horrible idea.  Windows Update has been getting worse and worse over the past couple of years.  Right now it's almost as bad as it was back in the late 1990's, when no sane person would install an updated anything unless it was part of a Service Pack.  If Microsoft isn't going to give me complete control over the update process, I'll be sticking with Windows 7 Pro.

Vivaldi doesn't really have [a lot of] extensions yet, but the some of the background tech is there in chrome, yet Vivaldi is fine and slowly improving before release.

This is a problem on it's own without even bringing up the diversity question. That goes for a lot of other tech job roles outside of coding as well.  Women face a problem getting into the industry even before they think about it. Many times they are not though of in K-12 environments as the ""type of person who would like to do this"". If they show an interest it's common for girls to be told that they shouldn't be by peers or teachers.  If a girl get through that and ends up in a college program, that trend continues in one way or another. If she doesn't change her major, then she has a high likelihood of ending up in a job where she's surrounded by white males (that's a whole other conversation).

I was lazy and decided to use an old debit card to buy ONE month's service. I know it's $10 but I dunno, I just wasn't ready to shell out $60 that day. I clicked the thing that said NOT to save my card info for further purchases..well it did. Played one month and just stopped. Just didn't play xbox one for like 3 months. Come march or april I start noticing bits of money gone missing. Called my bank to find out XBL had been nickel and diming me for the last few months at not only $9.99 but it was something like $11 each charge. I had never used the service in these months, called XBL to talk to a rep, then on to a supervisor who was HORRIBLE. Seriously treated me like a child.

Innovation in software is slowing as bold new ideas are less forthcoming and hardware while progression is slowing as the sheer scale of the efforts are finally starting to show a general slow down.  This happens to most industries where there is an approximately 30 year period where there is a massive flurry of innovations (Electrics in early 20th century, auto motive/flight in the middle) but eventually the big moves slow down.

Even if you want to come to Windows because of HoloLens, you want to come to it because of Xbox, you want to come to the desktop, all those get you to the phone."" The company's all-in-one app publishing solution, then, is something it'll push moving forward   Of all the major tech companies normally on people's minds, if there one company that can unite all cross-platform developing efforts, even partnering with startups doing cross-platform, it's Microsoft. And if as an added bonus to uniting those efforts, it can push Windows in there too, that's just cake on the icing.   Nadella sees holographic tech coming from other companies down the road: ""We will do HoloLens, and then, since the holographic computing platform is right there in Windows, there will be people who will build holographic computers beyond HoloLens.""   Totally the PC model that MS has been used to doing for decades."
microsoft,3di2m3,NotDaPunk,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:42:33 2015 UTC,"HoloLens is years away from being a consumer product. The first version is being focused on specialist vertical markets such as architecture, medicine and general research. The developers writing for these markets will be completely different than the developers writing mass-market phone apps. Even if they were the same a usable HoloLens app will require an experience designed for the form factor from the ground up. The amount of code that will be sharable with other platforms will be fairly minimal. Internet of Things development will be very similar.  The XBox team is doing everything they can to get hardcore gamers back on board. To do that they need the support of EA, Activision and the other AAA games publishers. The absolute last thing these guys what is to be in the same store as vast numbers of dollar or free games ported from phones. Therefore I expect the XBox store to always be invite only or highly curated. This is good for the XBox but means that it won't be a big app market.  So this leaves MS's cross platform push targeting very sickly phones, emerging tablets and the dominant traditional OS. Windows 10 on desktops (and tablets to an extent) can be developed for using the tools that developers know already such as Win32, .Net and the web. Those tools also easily support old versions of Windows and other platforms in the case of the web.

Not saying this is possible already today, but there have been some MS moves in that direction - that is, coming up with dev tools that you might use just to develop for Android, iOS, or even use on Linux. If you use those tools just for those platforms, then fine, nothing really changes. But say MS continues to push into development on all platforms, and along with their partners, eventually dominates all development tools (in ways similar to MS Office for example), then it would be easy for them to say something like, ""Oh, you develop for Android, well, all your code already works on Windows. Oh, you develop for iOS, well, all your code already works on Xbox. Oh, you develop for Linux, well, all your code already works on Windows mobile.""  ...similarly, if they say stuff like ""Oh, you develop for iOS, all your code already works for both Android and Linux"" then it would drive even more adoption of their tools."

microsoft,3dfvjo,reallyserious,3,Thu Jul 16 07:24:35 2015 UTC,It's not really fair to call it a '12 year old OS'.  It is more like a '7 year old OS'.  Keep in mind that 2003 R2 was released in December 05 - so essentially it was released in 2006.  Not only that but the replacement wasn't released until 2008.  So that means that in January of 2008 - Windows 2003 R2 was still the 'latest edition' you could buy.  Couple that with the fact that most vendors that wrote software for Windows didn't support Windows 2008 until well into the ~2010 era means that for most business the earliest you could upgrade would have been the 2010-2011 time frame.
microsoft,3dfvjo,djdementia,-1,Thu Jul 16 00:31:00 2015 UTC,"Yea, the fact that they waited until Vista SP1 to do Server 2008 is why Server 2003 got an extra year of support."
microsoft,3dfvjo,yuhong,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:13:39 2015 UTC,"Yea, the fact that they waited until Vista SP1 to do Server 2008   I think that you'll find that the Server editions of Windows typically lag behind the desktop versions by about 6 months or so.  This is by design, since they share much of the same kernel and APIs and it requires a little more robust testing with RC code before they can call it RTM.  Desktop customers don't get too upset if you push out a few major fixes shortly after the OS is released.  People running it on their enterprise servers do, though."

Consequently, it never gets upgraded, and the people who knew how to support the application leave the company.  The end users continue to use it without issue, and then 15-20 years later someone says ""Do you know that we have a server on our network that is 3 revisions behind what is currently supported?""  By this time the application vendor has likely gone out of business, or been bought/sold, or the application itself has been EOLed, or there is a new version that is 15 revisions newer and there is literally no upgrade path from where the company is today.  It happens."

Boss responded ""In fact, we don't know what this is for, but my previous boss always told us to never unplug it, or face the consequences"". So we follow the rules....

I'm really surprised to read about this as I've been convinced they moved their resources away from on prem apps to their Azure platform.

microsoft,3def08,pantspants,2,Thu Jul 16 00:58:20 2015 UTC,their focus on the cloud is irritating.   Why?
microsoft,3def08,waynerooney501,3,Thu Jul 16 01:48:38 2015 UTC,Because I don't want to put our infrastructure in the cloud. It's harder to support and the business is not super fond of our data being entirely stored by a third-party.  And it's fine if they offer cloud services. It's not fine when they act like not wanting those services is insanity.

microsoft,3def08,Unfunny_Asshole,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:16:29 2015 UTC,"Lots of reasons. Some companies want to stay on prem and keep their data behind their firewall. You can argue with that decision, but that's their position. After deciding that, it's a little painful to hear MS constantly talking about how great the cloud is while neglecting to mention much about they'll do for the non-cloud customer.  Another quick example. A lot of companies use SharePoint, and if a company purchased SharePoint 5 years ago and set up some sort of a social feed mechanism to allow employees to ask and answer questions, it can still be running the exact same way today. Now, that's not ""cool"", as it now will have a dated UI, but for companies with employees with, shall we say, a wide range of ages, that's not a bad thing. But companies in the cloud? For about one year MS said to use Yammer for that sort of social functionality. Now they say to use ""Office 365 Groups"", which has a completely different UI and set of capabilities. Currently, they're rolling out a completely new blog engine, as well as a hundred other new features. For IT folks that love experimenting with new stuff, Office 365 is freaking fantastic. But for IT folks that have to support users who don't like change? It's not as good.   So again, after making the decision to stay on prem, it may get frustrating to hear the MS salesperson constantly talking about features that only exist in the cloud while speaking only vaguely of enhancements coming for on-prem servers."

microsoft,3dewxo,PeterFnet,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:09:33 2015 UTC,"This definitely reminds me of what they did for the last major Windows launch: RTM is supposed to be launchable, however they know the have a window between RTM and GA. During that window, they will push as many bug fixes as possible.  Personally, I think it's a shady way of avoiding pushing back a release date."
microsoft,3dewxo,PeterFnet,2,Wed Jul 15 22:01:00 2015 UTC,"Another 2 months delay to fix all this would be far wiser than launching to the doubtlessly bad reception they're heading for. Especially seeing as they're going to make exactly $0 more by launching sooner rather than later.  Launching Edge in particular at this point is really shooting themselves in the foot. This is their one chance to prove they can make a great browser. And in truth they've done amazing things on the javascript processing side.

This one is not the final code.

microsoft,3dev28,phildtx,2,Wed Jul 15 22:39:46 2015 UTC,"The same goes for their Dev Center support. I am a native English speaker, and I should get support from a native English speaker. It's already difficult enough to communicate online about technical issues without the added complication of the person on the other end not being able to understand what you're saying (and vice versa).  It always takes several replies to actually pull the support person off their script and get them to acknowledge what the actual problem is.  I'm pretty good at helping myself when I have issues, and I only contact support when I've exhausted my options. Yet the support people are (of course) trained in only the most rudimentry things that any non-stupid person wouldn't need help with.  Their tech support is rarely better than 'have you tried turning it off an back on?'.  MS have some great people working on their forums answering questions and adding to discussions, but they also have several who can barely type coherently or give terse yes/no answers to more nuanced questions.  In the past I've found that support often comes down to the individual who picks up your ticket.

microsoft,3dev28,msftshill,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:40:59 2015 UTC,"I did, the first day. They were understanding, but said the only way to cancel a pending charge was to have the merchant call in and request it. I explained this to Microsoft, gave them the department name and phone number, but they refused to call.  The card company (Discover) did put a watch on it to make sure I was only charged once, but they couldn't change the $3k worth of credit that was held up.  Apparently, pending charges can drop as soon as one day, or as long as a week or more. Just my luck, I guess.  After it dropped I got a call from Microsoft in Texas, who said that of course they could have reversed it, and have a policy in place for that. Sadly, Shanghai didn't know that."

They're trying to shove the Windows store in front of people's faces without understanding that people already know what they want. No one is going to be buying all of these devices. The consumer themselves are not going to be investing their money in shitty apps, and then eventually transition to the continued bleak environment of Windows Phone.  He sounded so vague for most of his talk. He kept saying how Windows experience is going to be on all phones now, and then somehow started talking again with his brand new rhetoric of ""Windows experience across devices"". Sure, apps for Windows may have a great environment to development for, but still no one cares.  They're creating ""company solutions"" without really doing anything new in front of the consumer. Which he says he cares about now, but I don't think he knows what he is doing."
microsoft,3dahsb,iEATu23,4,Wed Jul 15 06:38:06 2015 UTC,"I don't think they are shoving  anything in peoples faces.    What I get is they are doing something like Spotify creates an app for Windows 10 on PC because that is where the money is, but they essentially just made an app for pc, tablet, and phone.  Simply because it's all one OS.    Consumer has a Surface 3 and a Desktop, he gets integrated with cortana everything works out, he likes the help that cortana has given him, she suggests things he is interested in.    So it comes down to a situation where you have   A:  Consumer doesn't plan to switch to a Windows phone because he likes his iPhone.  That's ok here are 10 really good apps we have in the Apple Store that are integrated with MS cloud system.   B: Consumer see's there is a new windows phone seems ok good reviews maybe he thinks of buying one.    In either scenario Nadella would be happy with based on what he said.  Consumer is still plugged into Windows Services be it Office, Onedrive, Apps or whatever.  He probably would prefer the second scenario, but he is well aware of the possibility that nothing he can do will make that consumer buy a Windows phone.  I have just about microsoft everything except I have been with iPhone since 3, but I have 10 Microsoft Apps on my iPhone.  I don't think I'm missing anything by not having a windows phone except some native stuff, but pretty much everything is connected.

Stay with me now, is available so people from other platforms and people with legacy software can expand their distribution.  If I am am indie developer for Android, and I want my game on pc, I can either a, go through and rewrite, or b, port and update to be a universal app.  Even if I have to write 40% of my code again, 60% is done.  Now, my hipster game is available to anyone with a pc running any modern Windows OS. This inadvertently helps mobile because... They run the same apps.  I could say that you have windows phone now because... Wait for it... You have the same apps.  I don't mean just apps, this covers win32 api and .net framework, which is like 90% of software for windows.  So when those are updated to support OTA purchasing and updating, mobile is benefited...

My daughter who is using an iPhone 6 isn't going to want to switch to a Windows Phone because it runs the same apps.  I assume Microsoft is targeting new phone users who haven't bought into a mobile platform but this would be a very small group, certainly not enough to rescue WP.

You have caught on to their master plan.  Now, bare with me.  Since I'm a developer I can probably tell you what happened.  You know code, while most times runs great, can have bugs.  That means that something was supposed to happen, but it didn't and something else did.  This is very troubling for devs, so much so that we provided forums for people to go and complain about this being a mastermind plan to screw old people out of $20 each.  Seriously, are you retarted?

microsoft,3d10b6,StoneCypher,6,Sun Jul 12 18:44:42 2015 UTC,"Speaking as a long-time WP user, I'm still crossing my fingers and hoping it will take off, for once. As it stands the platform is missing some heavy hitters like Snapchat although third-party apps for popular services like Instagram etc can often adequately replace and in some cases are even better than their first-party offerings on iOS/Android. I'm not a heavy app user so the app situation is not a big deal to me but it is for some people. Where you will really be missing out is in the niche app category - things like personal banking apps are mostly absent from WP (so far).  Whether this stands to change with Windows 10 is still up in the air but judging from the current outlook the situation should be better than it is now at least.      I'm not exactly in the loop with Windows 10 development but one of the big features coming is Continuum which essentially turns your tablet/phone into a mobile PC you can hook up on displays. That and unified store, Universal Apps and things.   The most significant thing - as it seems to me - is that Windows Phone is finally going to be a part of a cohesive Microsoft ecosystem instead of a red-headed stepchild that it is up until now."
microsoft,3d10b6,Fhaarkas,2,Sun Jul 12 19:05:51 2015 UTC,"Continuum looks quite interesting but you'll still end up with a half-breed. It's not like the Ubuntu-system Canonical planned which will actually run Ubuntu. It doesn't seem at first glance like it will support a native Windows app. It ran a mobile version of Office. So I can't run say.... Visual Studio or anything lilke that on it even though the handset could have the hardware to run it.  They do seem to try to tie it more together, which is very good. Might stimulate the growth in business environments, which has always been one of Microsoft's big focus groups.   It still seems like it is some way to go before it's a viable option for more demanding users than your average Joe(Which doesn't even get Snapchat)."
microsoft,3d10b6,BRi7X,2,Sun Jul 12 19:35:41 2015 UTC,"and that'd fall down to software architecture, sadly. though these phones are getting pretty insane.. it's up to the developers to make ARM versions of their desktop apps, and up to Microsoft to allow non-store apps to run in what I basically gather is going to turn Windows Mobile into Windows RT."

microsoft,3d10b6,Dextherex,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:29:07 2015 UTC,"No. Not ""ARM versions"", they have to be a Universal App. So any Windows app, developed for Xbox, PC, Tablet or phone, written in C#/XAML, now requires the developer to basically check a few boxes and there will be a separate version for each form factor, sharing app data but with changing interface.    With Windows phone 7, you had to make a separate app for phone, then make an app for desktop. This automatically creates multiple versions, which ""talk"" to each other, and in the case of continuum, you can use the ""full"" desktop version on your phone."

I am not going to compare hardware as the iPhone is the latest greatest.  For the age that the Phones are, the 920 and the 4 actually hold up fairly well. I have some hesitation points with recommending WP to anyone at the moment.   1) Make sure you have your apps are available and you can live with the state they are in.  2) WP is 3rd on the list to receive app updates (after iOS and Android) , if at all. This is due to market share and user demographics, I get it. But it does not increase user base.  3) Microsoft does not treat WP like it is a first rate phone. I get better implementations and bug fixes of Office on my iPhone than on my Windows Phone. Paul Thorrott also noted this, and recommended the iPhone for the Office experience.   Okay, enough on the dislikes. The likes:  1) It is different than either Android or iOS. MS did their own thing (Like it or hate it).   2) It is fast on the hardware.   3) I have yet to experience any hardware/os/app blips on the phone (it is stable), like I have on iOS or Android (apps that I am using just ends or the phone reboots without warning).   4) I like the way Nokia designed their handsets. I think the 920 is the epitome of smart phone design. It fits in my hand very nicely and has the right amount of heft. (I get this is purely subjective).  My personal usage preference is iOS, WP, then Android.  One App I wish would be ported off of Windows Phone to iOS : Freda. I absolutely enjoy reading books in that application."

You'll miss a lot of apps, although looking at the top 10 on the Play store, the only notable absentee (that's not a game) is Snapchat. Of the default apps, maps is excellent, mail and photos are okay, and music is terrible. What are your main apps now?  Having said that, it's definitely better than it used to be. These days we have Vine, Instagram, and Spotify. I nearly threw a party the day Mint released. Games are still really terrible and, the the review process is a joke. Looking at the new + rising games right now... there's fake Sims, fake Pokemon, fake Clash of Kings, fake Scribblenauts, etc.  I personally haven't noticed any huge benefits from using Windows phone with PC Windows. Your PC won't alert you to incoming calls, or text messages like Macs do. One thing that is kind of cool though is the OneDrive integration. Thumbnails for the photos you take on your phone will show up on your PC, but the actual photo is only downloaded after you try to open it. Also, if you buy an app on the WP store, if it's available on PC you have it there too.  Also, don't forget that Microsoft just dumped 8000 people from its mobile division. I get that they're trying to free up room so that OEMs aren't competing with a million Lumia devices, but it's still worrying. I love Windows Phone, but you might want to see how it plays out before you take the dive.  TL;DR Apps are improving, but still weak. Games are horrible. No major benefits from using Windows phone with Windows PC."
microsoft,3d10b6,buttersauce,3,Sun Jul 12 18:45:00 2015 UTC,I think texting from your PC would be the thing that would make me switch to windows phone.

Lets say I've had my license since I was 16 and I'm now in my mid 20s, but I don't drive much, mostly because I've been focusing most of my energy elsewhere for the last several years.  I'm out one night with my friends, and one of them convinces me that the reason I don't drive much is because I need a shiny, expensive new car.  My other friends are against this idea, but this one friend is truly adamant and demands I buy a Ferrari or else he's never going to speak to any of us again.  Reluctantly, I decide to take his advice and I go buy a Ferrari.  I have the Ferrari for a few months, the friend who pushed me into buying it ends up leaving anyway, and I realize that I'm now stuck with a car that was expensive to buy, is expensive to maintain, and doesn't drive quite the way I was hoping it would.  I also realize that I enjoy driving my old car just about as much as I enjoy this one, as long as I have a kickass sound system I'm happy.

Can you imagine? Someone spends days or weeks getting some fantastic dashboard created, and then right before a big meeting is cleaning up a few things and accidentally deletes the wrong dataset. Nothing is stored locally, so it's just gone. Not good.  Also, reports and dashboards are apparently stored in a way that is associated with an individual user account. Please correct me if I'm off on this, as I'm still trying to understand it, but it would seem that after a few years, there's going to be data sources and dashboards that belong to users who are no longer there? Are there mechanisms to transfer control to other users? Or admin tools to generate a complete list of data sources and reports that exist? I know in SSRS deployments, a lot of companies would try to set up mechanisms so that only certain users could publish reports, or that only reports that have been vetted for accuracy would be allowed to be published, etc. This seems to throw all that to the wind, as any employee can create a report and share it.

The surface 3 is an excellent tablet.  When it comes to actual computers, the surface 3 is very underpowered.  The SP2 would murder the S3 in every benchmark test.  It might have worse battery life though.  However, for what you have stated you're going to use it for I think the Surface 3 would suit you well.  The things you want to do are not resource intensive so a SP2 might be overkill.    And as others have stated the SP3/S3 are thinner and lighter.  That portability is a pretty big deal for me.

A surface 3 would be great for handling note taking, using the office suite, and media consumption.  It could even do some light photoshopping.  Unless you plan on doing heavy duty work on the go, you should be fine.  One thing that isn't brought up nearly enough is remote desktop as well.

microsoft,3csadp,nicoschuele,0,Fri Jul 10 10:55:34 2015 UTC,"I think Windows 10 will allow the folks who normally would have bought a Windows laptop to now continue to do so.  Most are scared up 'upgrading' to Windows 8.  Windows 10 removes that barrier and actually delivers a much smoother, functional, familiar - and dare I say 'fun' - user experience.  OSX still has a very, very small market share.  It will remain a niche unless truly less expensive products come out that run it.    Additionally, there are many applications that still only run on Windows, especially games.  This isn't going to change quickly; MS is doubling down now on PC game and XBOX integration.  The PC (Windows) platform is just going to be more compelling in the future with Windows 10.  Will the showy Starbucks crowd with their glowing logos switch?  Most likely not."

microsoft,3cnrag,bgroins,67,Thu Jul 9 21:05:25 2015 UTC,"During Build 2015, the company’s developer conference, Microsoft basically killed any incentive for developers to create apps that natively target Windows Phones by giving programmers a new way to “easily” port code from Android or iOS instead. So now it makes even more sense to build Android or iOS apps first, and then maybe put them on Windows.   Windows Phone ""sucks"" because of lack of apps, and now Microsoft spends money and time developing a tool to make closing the app gap way easier... and spending these resources apparently mean they want to shut down WP..?  Idiotic. Why would anyone think making it easy to port from iOS/Android to WP meant that they were giving up? It's obviously going to be the case for a good while longer that apps first make iOS and Android, so making a good porting tool isn't exactly lack of confidence that devs won't target WP first, it's accepting the obvious reality that devs won't target WP first."
microsoft,3cnrag,Doctor_Sigmund_Freud,28,Thu Jul 9 12:35:00 2015 UTC,"That's pretty much spot on. If anything, Microsoft is actually increasing their efforts on the mobile market rather than ""giving up""."
microsoft,3cnrag,HaraKira,6,Thu Jul 9 12:46:58 2015 UTC,Historically that sort of move hasn't ever been of long term benefit.  Making porting easier unfortunately typically leads to less well built applications.  I would love for Windows Phone to be competitive but they haven't really shown they can energize anyone but the base.  I'm not sure what they need to do but I do have to say that I think more clearly differentiated phones may help.  I think a diverse offering in any product can cause confusion and frustration.  It also makes for a harder marketing effort.  So again Gizmodo always goes for pretty controversial headlines which drive clicks.  I don't fully agree or disagree with their analysis.  I hope with a more focused line of phones will make their marketing and message clearer.

Windows phone sold 34.9 million units last year and is seen as a huge failure that isn't worth developing software for. Playstation 4 sold 13.65 million units during the same period and is seen as a huge success which developers are flocking to. You can argue that Playstation owners spend more money, but I would guess that Windows phone users spend more time with their device and are more influenced by the software they use. Any success in the mobile space is a huge win for gaining an audience. Apple sold over 5 iPhones for every Windows phone sale, but I would say that both are big successes. The attitude that there can be no third place seems silly, especially with easy porting and universal apps."

For example, nobody would pay even $1 for the Dominos pizza app, but they make tons of money selling pizza through it. Other apps are meant to serve ads or sales. Just because people don't like to pay much initially on phones doesn't mean there isn't money to be made. It's all about services purchased through apps."

Yes, layoffs are always a bad sign, but let's be honest, it would be foolish in the extreme for Microsoft to abandon windows phone, so they'll have to remain in the phone business because the lumia line is windows phone.

They need this consolidation so that they can get behind a more unified and focused product portfolio. One flagship device, and one low-end device. Then maybe one more device for the mid-range, but even that is iffy. Then they can do one or two ultra low-end variants for emerging markets. They shouldn't have more than 4 or 5 total models shipping worldwide, and then they can have focused marketing like Apple and Samsung do. They can call them the Lumia Pro (flagship), the Lumia (mid or low range), and then the Lumia X (or E, or I, our whatever) for the lowest level stuff. Then every year refresh with Lumia Pro 2/Lumia 2/Lumia X 2, 3, etc."

This makes perfect sense to me.  Much easier to compare and contrast if it's done this way. I have been checking out youtube reviews of the Lumia 640 XL these past few days, and one of the things that jumped out at me was what the hell is up with this model numbering system?   I understand that's how nokia has always done it, but as someone who has never owned a lumia it's gets slightly confusing.  Like I say as an Android phone user you don't see this kind of confusing numbering among the different manufacturers.  I think you have said this way better than I can, but basically more unified and focused phone products I wholeheartedly agree."
microsoft,3cjpqc,HawkinsDB,2,Wed Jul 8 19:35:47 2015 UTC,"Everything you need to know about the Lumia numbering scheme:  So there's two phones (say, the 521 and the 640).  Which is better?  The 5 is less than the 6.  This means that the 521 comes from a lower end line than the 640, and (at first glance) will have less features.  The 2 is less than the 4.  This means that the 521 comes from a set of phones that are older than the 640.  There's a 1, and a 0.  These just refer to differences per carrier -- for example, does it support LTE or not, or CDMA, or stuff that matches a phone to a carrier.  Lastly, there's the 640 and the 640XL.  The 640XL is physically much larger than the 640; you should pick the one that fits your hand.  Or the one that your carrier offers.   It also just so happens that the 640 hits a nice sweet spot of good features and good performance for a remarkable price.  In boxing terms, it punches above its weight, and it probably a better fit for most people than most 7xx or 8xx phones (which are older anyway).  (disclaimer: this is just what I see)"

microsoft,3clbld,GiulianoM,2,Wed Jul 8 23:51:27 2015 UTC,"There's really not a whole lot on configuring FC in the study materials.  It's just setting up the virtual FC adapter, since anything beyond that is out of the scope of the exam and deals with fiber switches and SANs.  If you install the Hyper-V feature/role you can definitely setup virtual switches.  Be warned that they may have effects on your normal networking, I've seen a couple of weird issues arise.   For ex. at one point my workstation decided the best possible route to 0.0.0.0 is to route through my internal hyper-v lab (instead of my actual default gateway).   There also isn't a lot on the virtual switches or converged networking in the study materials.   A good lab exercise is to setup a virtual FC switch on an internal only subnet/vlan then use Routing + Remote Access in server 2012 to route between the internal network and your own home LAN, and perform NAT to the lab network.   You will need to use two network cards in the RRAS server, one bridged to your normal network and the other plugged into the private switch.  There is a lot more to study on RRAS than virtual switches anyway.  They are dead simple dumb switches with no edge or l3 capabilities."
microsoft,3clbld,syllabic,2,Thu Jul 9 01:01:17 2015 UTC,"Virtual switches are huge, you will definitely need to know those backwards and forwards for the exam.  It's just too fundamental to ignore.  Virtual fibre channel...I can't recall.  There's a pretty good chance that you'll get at a question or two on it.  I have never used virtual FC, even in a lab, but I managed the exam with no problems.  For both of these technologies it's more important that you understand how they work and how they are configured than it is that you have configured them yourself.  That being said, the best way to learn is by doing.  My advice is that you download Hyper-V 2012 R2 from Microsoft.  It's a 100% free product and has been from the beginning.  Install it on a box, get familiar with it, and then hit the books really hard for the pieces that you cannot do in your lab (i.e., virtual FC)."

It would be a total disaster for Microsoft to totally leave windows phone all together. And I doubt they have plans to. Since the lumia line pretty much is windows phone, Microsoft really needs to keep making phones, and they never said they were not making phones. If you look at the restructuring we're hearing they are dumping a lot of people in Finland. That's probably mostly engineering talent. Imagine Microsoft has more than enough engineers to handle windows phone and didn't need them.  Then there are the manufacturing jobs they are eliminating. Also pointless to speculate on that. I would guess they want to move away from making the devices themselves and have someone else make them. Again, whoever puts the hardware together is irrelevant.

Lenovo and Dell stepped their game up, considerably.   6 Billion for a 1st class phone manufacturing business isn't that bad.    shift the cost burden   For a time. First thing they did was layoff a LOT of NOK folks. Now more are getting the axe as they streamline. This is a long term strategy, much like the 7 billion they spent on Skype.

If anyone has ever owned an Android device you know this is exactly how they push out Android updates to users. It not only prevents server overload (which will prevent anyone from getting it) but also allows MS to address any critical bugs as they are rolling out the system before it affects millions.

Microsoft instead continues to stress HTML5. Everyone is assuming the worst, which is why Netflix jumped ship.  However, the fact is that the only official word from Microsoft is that the current version of Silverlight will cease to be supported after 2021, six years from now. So there is breathing room.

Today's most important example is Skype: Skype modern app will stop functioning tomorrow, leaving all people who invested in Windows RT hardware without Skype at all. They are being punished by MS because one of MS technologies (windows RT) turned out as a failure. On the top of this, MS keeps polishing their Skype app for iOS and Android. I am an early adopter of the MS band: MS claims on their MS health website a huge program of health integration, but so far, only very minor updates have happened. I really fear that MS health could be discontinued soon, instead of being brought forward as promised (again, punishing early adopters).  You can say: MS focuses on the high-revenue products. This is true, but does not change my point: it punishes the early adopters, those who have faith and invest their money in new technologies or services."
