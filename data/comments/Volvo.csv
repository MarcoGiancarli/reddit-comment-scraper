No noise on the 30 minute trip before hand, and it's been making it since. I checked all fluids and they are as they should be. Does anyone know what this noise could be?"
Volvo,3e53vv,AlfaGTV6,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:56:05 2015 UTC,"Does it make it all the time now, or only when warm? My guess from the video would be the fan. Could also be a belt."

You'll need to pull the alternator plug first to check the pins and color before you can be certain of what you need. I needed the Bosch AL9436X (3 pin plug, whitish color). I ordered a refurb from ebay for $185 shipped, although the seller recently created a new account and upped the price a tad. Mine came from Foreign & Domestic Auto Electric, they are trustworthy.  http://www.ebay.com/itm/Bosch-AL9436X-Volvo-36001463-Alternator-C70-S40-V50-/252032841421?hash=item3aae53f6cd&vxp=mtr  They also list the VIN range for this part - last 6 of the VIN should fall between 040123 to 270049.  Do the two serp belts when you do the alternator. Not an ""easy"" job, as the throttle body has to come out to tetris the alternator out."

Volvo,3e55i3,240nerd,2,Wed Jul 22 01:07:45 2015 UTC,"That isn't the map sensor. That is the purge valve for the evap system.  It sits on the fan shroud and has two hoses hooked up to it.   The map sensor is screwed into the inlet air tube that is black, plastic, and right under the intake plenum. If you can get the sensor off without taking out the intake tube off that will save some time and effort.   If you know what the map sensor is and you're only asking what these guys are then I apologize for misunderstanding.   The AC clutch always being on means that the system is low on refrigerant, it keeps clicking on to try and cool the air. It can do a better job with the correct amount of r134a in the system. Make sure to add PAG oil as well to the system when you tank it up."

Volvo,3e57sx,MrK9182,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:00:21 2015 UTC,I'm a Volvo master tech. I've heard that noise before.    You have to remove the heat shield on the manifold to tighten the nuts.    The noise you are hearing is exhaust gases escaping between the manifold and cylinder head.

Volvo,3e39kc,dirtisgood,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:08:27 2015 UTC,Typically not because there are restrictions on how many lights are running at any given time. I think 4 is the max in most states - so low beams and fog lights in most cases.   Theres also a maximum lumen level in some states.

Note: Safe and secure does not transfer to a second owner if the car was originally leased.  It does transfer if originally sold.  You should just google "" volvo safe and secure"" and your model year and I think you will see if it is covered.

The Golf wagon is a wonderful car...and if it was offered in R flavor, it'd be a tough choice.

Volvo,3dvm9w,planbaker922,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:15:17 2015 UTC,"Yes I have. I put two bottles in late May according to their instructions for stopping a rear main seal leak.   Before I used it there was a consistent film of oil dripping down my oil pan. I knew it was more than likely the RMS so I took a chance with the AutoRX.  I added it right before a 3,500 mile road trip. Towards the end of the trip I got under my car to see if I could see oil dripping and was pleased to see that it was totally dry. To be sure I checked periodically over the next few hundred miles and it was always fine. After my next oil change things seemed to be okay but recently I'm wondering if the leak has started up again. I haven't had a chance to get under my car recently so I'm not really 100% sure.  As far as the the claims people have made about an increase in power and engine performance go I can't really say. I will say that my engine used to idle fine but would periodically sputter slightly with a mild shake. It no longer does this and idles very smoothly/quietly. HOWEVER I changed my motor mounts the same day I added the AutoRX so that change is more than likely from the mounts.  With all that being said I just want to say to use caution when looking at ""cure in a bottle"" things for cars. Obviously this is coming from somebody who used it and had a decently positive experience but it's still worth it to say that there is no substitute for a real repair done right."

Volvo,3ds8j9,MrK9182,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:46:23 2015 UTC,If the head gasket was leaking the oil would be underneath the headers.    The black cover on top of your engine is the valve cover. It has a gasket the seals it to the cylinder head.  You can probably pick one up for under $10 and it will take 15 minutes to replace with basic hand tools.    The oil cap seal is on your oil cap. Take your cap off and flip it over.  That big black oring is probably rock hard.  Replace that.  Any Volvo place should have them for a dollar or so.  Don't let them sell you an entire cap.

Volvo,3dj6x9,rootbeer_cigarettes,2,Thu Jul 16 20:14:22 2015 UTC,"As mentioned previously, high mileage is not a major concern as long as maintenance has been done correctly and on time.    You should be extremely worried about the timing belt.  It should be replace once every 7 years or 70K miles.  If the interval has been exceeded you should get a quote for the work and knock that off the price of car.  If the belt breaks because its not been replaced the engine will destroy itself internally.  The ABS/Tracs issue is very likely dirty ABS sensors at the wheels and should be a quick and easy fix.  The AC issues is in fact common on the P80 cars.  Most of the time it is due to a rusted out evaporator.  Cheap part but labor is extremely high since the entire dash needs to be removed.  You can also use that to get the price down.  If you're handy with a wrench you can replace the evaporator yourself.  Its not a hard job simply takes a long time.  If everything checks out ok and the turbo spools nicely I would jump on it if you can get the price down a bit."
Volvo,3dj6x9,rootbeer_cigarettes,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:26:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice. I'm looking at the car again this weekend and will check the last time the timing belt was done.  Is there a fairly simple to check for a rusted evaporator? Considering just taking it to a mechanic, but there aren't any Volvo specialists in the area."
Volvo,3dj6x9,kronco,2,Thu Jul 16 23:46:36 2015 UTC,"Well the evaporator is behind the dash so you can't physically check it without ripping the dash out, so short answer is no, there's no easy check for it.  One think you can look for is to check under the passenger side cowl for a cabin filter. While the lack of a filter isn't conclusive proof of a rusted evaporator it is further evidenced suggesting that's where the problem lies.  No cabin filter usually leads to a leaking evaporator."
Volvo,3dj6x9,rootbeer_cigarettes,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:26:34 2015 UTC,"The cabin filter was added in model year 98 with the 70 series.  The 850s can use the same cabin filter if you buy the housing and add it. But you would have to 'upgrade' an older car so I would not expect to see a cabin filter in a 95.  95 also has a different ABS systems then 96 and later.  They don't fail as often as the later ABS (where the controller solder joints fail). My experience has been the pump fails.   At about 20 mph you should hear it do a self test.  When the ABS failed on our 95 it stopped making the self-diagnostic noise. You can read the ABS diagnostic code on a 95:  http://volvospeed.com/volvo_repairs_how_tos/general-volvo-repair-information-and-service/volvo_diagnostic_trouble_codes_abs.html  A lot of 850s have a failed gear in the odometer that causes it to stop recording the mileage.  You can use the under-hood LED readouts to get the true mileage in case it has ever failed.  Robert covers that, too:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9K-1WChRr9k  That same under hood readout will give you any error codes that have been stored for engine and transmission:  http://volvospeed.com/volvo_repairs_how_tos/general-volvo-repair-information-and-service/volvo_diagnostic_trouble_codes_a2.html  http://volvospeed.com/volvo_repairs_how_tos/general-volvo-repair-information-and-service/diagnostic_trouble_codes.html"
Volvo,3dj6x9,walczyk,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:43:28 2015 UTC,"The OBD1 port will read out the mileage on the instrument cluster not the ECU so if the cluster has ever been swapped out you'll be reading the wrong mileage so that's something to keep in mind.  I'm fully aware the ABS on the 95's is different, since I just happen to drive one.    And as far as the cabins go, some 850s came with them some didn't.  That doesn't change the fact that a cabin filter helps protect the evaporator; so once again, if we're looking for clues as to the condition of the evaporator the lack of a cabin filter combined with non functioning AC suggests the evaporator has in fact bit the dust."

I have been drooling over 240's for the past year. From what the owner says it's been well maintained I have not witnessed that in person just yet. I just want to get advice if going older is a good decision. From what I know and heard with 249's as long as it's been maintained they will last forever."
Volvo,3dgtwi,AwesomeTreehouse,2,Fri Jul 17 19:46:43 2015 UTC,"I've been driving redblock Volvo's for years now and currently drive a 92 245 so I'm very biased towards them so take my advice for what it's worth.  The people who say 240's (or Volvos in general) aren't cars that have low maintenance costs aren't wrong but they're not entirely right either. It all comes down to how willing you are to get your hands dirty and what you consider ""low maintenance costs"". If that means a car that you just have to give oil every month or so then you'll be disappointed for sure. But that's not because Volvo. It's because that isn't really the case for any car if you want it to run well and live long.  If you do your own work, do preventative maintenance, drive it nicely, and never let it get bad you will have a car that is costing you very little each month.  When people talk about 240's lasting forever as long as they are maintained they obviously mean oil/filter changes every 3k or so but they also mean things like   keeping up with all fluid change intervals keeping up with v-belt and timing belt changes never letting the PCV system gunk up and build pressure changing out any old/leaky seals keeping up with air/fuel/trans filter changes   There's more than that but basically if you keep things in good shape before they become a problem the car won't give you any problems. From there it'll just do what it does best; start up every time and get you where you need to be."

Volvo,3dbxuo,Ves7,3,Wed Jul 15 02:03:05 2015 UTC,I would check:   Starter safety switch (Actually lift the trim panel and check for function with a multimeter). Bypass if necessary. Wires to starter - look for corrosion and damaged insulation. Should be visible from under driver's side of car.   Does the starter make ANY noise at all in the Start key position?  Either way you probably should plan to take a cab or friend's car to work tomorrow. Not a quick fix if it's anything other than the safety switch.
Volvo,3dbxuo,Khrrck,2,Wed Jul 15 02:21:08 2015 UTC,I whacked the starter with a wrench. Started right up. Now how long can I keep doing that. Just needs to last until next week
Volvo,3dbxuo,Khrrck,2,Wed Jul 15 14:02:39 2015 UTC,"It will probably keep working until next week, but I wouldn't push it beyond that.

Volvo,3dbxuo,rootbeer_cigarettes,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:16:00 2015 UTC,Just out of curiosity what the heck does spinning the fuses mean?  I'm not an expert on the redblock motors but you should be able to jumper the starter to see if it works.  Easy google search should show you how to do that.  If you can verify the starter itself works then you're looking at a wiring issue for the wiring between the ignition switch and the starter solenoid.  I would search the forums. I'm certain you're not the first 240 owner with a no crank situation.  EDIT: I've never experienced this myself but often times you can hit the starter with a hammer or something to get it to engage. If that works you can safely assume the starter itself has gone bad.

Volvo,3dbxuo,dixiekoko,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:57:27 2015 UTC,"Get a ~ 4 foot long piece of wire. 12 or 14 gauge would be fine. Put a female spade clip on on one end.   Find the wire that has a similar spade clip on the starter solenoid, disconnect it and replace with your new wire. (there might be a couple spade clips with wires on the solenoid. Try both)  Touch the other end of your wire to the positive battery cable. Make sure it's in park, and hand brake is set.   This will bypass EVERYTHING between the ignition switch and the starter, which is to say, it should crank over even with ignition off and key removed.    If the starter does turn the engine over, go ahead and put the key in, turn the ignition on. Again, PUT IN PARK, HAND BRAKE ON, and the car should start. Then you can drive it around until you find the culprit.  And, of course, in doing this, if the starter doesn't turn the motor around, then get a starter."

I know Lucky very well and have not had an issue with his tuning or services, he has helped me out in my time of need and has always been there to happily assist with me picking his brain and answering my many questions. I have had three different tunes for my 3 p80 cars now and haven't had an issue after 30 thousand miles of hard driving on my high mileage 850 Turbo (14psi) and countless miles on my 98 S70 T5 (17psi tune). No overboosting, and MPG has had a nice bump too. You are going to have mixed results from everyone, most of the people that trash ARD tuning have little or no experience with them other than what they see posted up in Volvospeed on Facebook. Related to what volvonut90 said, it seem that us west coasters have much better luck with ARD than all the guys on the east side. Just my two cents."

Volvo,3d6te2,planbaker922,3,Mon Jul 13 23:46:07 2015 UTC,Probably a massive air leak that the ecu can't compensate for. Check the intake manifold is sealed completely. Check the turbo piping as well. Then check all the ports on the manifold.
Volvo,3d6te2,wallaby13,2,Tue Jul 14 01:46:44 2015 UTC,"Along the same line of thought, make sure the intake manifold gasket was installed correctly. You could be leaking air there as well.   Check the vacuum hose at the passenger side of the intake manifold as well."

Volvo,3d6te2,rootbeer_cigarettes,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:47:24 2015 UTC,It very well could be.  If the gasket doesn't seal correctly you'll likely have a major vacuum leak which can cause the engine to die.  Replace the gasket and install it correctly and try again.  Let us know how it goes.

Volvo,3d02qv,PowerStarter,2,Sun Jul 12 19:33:49 2015 UTC,afaik not on this distance. This is more a problem with tele lenses and if you're relatively close to the minimum focus distance. You easily get pictures then in which the nose is sharp but the eyes are already blurry.

But seeing the circumstances under which it went....I'd say to start looking for another car.  Now you've got options here: Sell the S40 to some teenager on Craigslist and make a quick buck.  Part the car out.  Buy another s40 and use this one for parts (if you have the room for it)  If you're short on cash though, I'd honestly advise you to sell the car whole, and buy a decent looking Toyota Corolla or Camry. Those things will take a horrendous beating and still start up in the morning. Volvos tend to catastrophically let you know when something went wrong.  Sorry for the wall of text."

Turning it down one last notch to LO causes the fan to go full blast, but no more cooling.  At the end of the drive it was warmer inside the car than out.

Volvo,3cpmnp,RobsZombies,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:35:52 2015 UTC,Accessory belt? The only issue is the emergency brake cable keeps sticking.  Every few months I pull of the wheel and rotor and work the cable loose and lube it up.  Idk why you mentioned the accessory belt but I may want to check the tension on that asap.  it has 140k mi and is wonderful.

One is for the brake lights, and the other is for CC. Perhaps you need to adjust the bracket a little bit to move the switches closer to the pedal, or wrap a few layers of friction tape around the pedal to build it up a bit?"

P2 V70Rs (04-07) are more common and there a few variants depending on the year, just like the P80 models.   Depending on what you want and the condition, you could pick up a beater P80 for 2k or a pristine P2 in a desirable color combo for 15k.   Send time on swedespeed.com and volvospeed.com and also check craigslist in colder regions and by the coasts. I rarely see Volvos in the middle of the country and always see a ton in PNW and the east coast, north of DC, especially NE.

Volvo,3coiz4,triggah,2,Thu Jul 9 18:05:17 2015 UTC,"That's not a bad idea but maintenance on a P2 Volvo is more in depth than a P80. I'm guessing if you own an XC already of that vintage, that you know about it.  That's a good price for the R with the miles but I'm guessing the colors are not as desirable and 04 is older than the 06/07 models with the additional features and refreshed design.  Do your due diligence and make sure you're not buying a lemon. I find that the owner can tell you a lot about how the car was treated and not necessarily from his mouth. Things like how he talks about the car or how he treats himself are good factors.  Other than that, drive the piss out of it!"

Further, if there's some left and it comes in contact with you or the interior of your car, they may give you chemical burns and may eat through e.g. the fabric in your seats.

Pros  Fast, fuel efficient, reliable, comfortable, and it's the 760 so you get a few more features than the 740 would have.  Fun to work on. It's not like working on American or Japanese, so it will take some tinkering, but when you get the hang of it, you'll come to realize it's a very logical setup and in my experience, they're a blast to work on.  2.3L redblock. The famous ""bulletproof"" Volvo engine. Plenty of forums to pick from for info, as well as an absurdly fast engine when equipped with the turbocharger. You won't have any problems getting half a million + miles on it.  Cons   It has a boost gauge, and it's insanely satisfying to watch the needle bury on it. Which burns a lot of gas. It's fun though, so consider it a pro as well.  Above all, it's an excellent car. The one you posted has ~140,000 less kilometers than mine, and let me tell ya - I haven't had any problems worse than the glove box not locking properly. That being said, it cost me a few short of $200 in overdue bits of maintenance here and there.  Regularly service that brick and it'll last you a lifetime :)"

I mean you can, but you have to have the shop do a little extra fabrication.  To buy the OEM Volvo part was something like $800. The after market that was exactly like the OEM (but obviously, with something like a cat, you have to be aware may or may not last as long as the OEM) was, cheapest price, $450 ish.  The universal is around $100, but requires the fabrication mentioned above.  So its not a cheap repair. Get some different quotes and talk to your guy about which route would be best for you. Our S70 is a backup car, so we're going to wait a little bit before doing the replacement."

Volvo,3cgcai,GRat9717,2,Tue Jul 7 19:54:23 2015 UTC,Well here's the thing. There is a major difference between an R and R-Design. An R-Design will not have any of the extra performance perks of the Rs of the past. Therefore no upgraded brakes or engine performance mods from the factory. Mostly what you get are cosmetics. Still worth it though.

Volvo,3ce5tj,kronco,2,Tue Jul 7 14:39:37 2015 UTC,"Bang for the buck on those is very low.  They won't add power (you have to change the engine management software to add any noticeable power).  For engine power, an IPD tune is the best performance increase for the money spent.  You can often find used ECUs with the tune on swedespeed.com's used parts forum."

This is what the early ('94) 850 turbos came with, and last time I read up on it the TL;DR was, it makes no significant difference compared to the later style piping.

I wouldn't make mine that low all the time (It's on bags, so it is really sitting that way just for pictures) but what he did with the rest of the build is pretty spectacular."
Volvo,3ccaal,ronisolomondds,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:46:58 2015 UTC,"I bet that 142 handles like it's on rails, though."
Volvo,3ccaal,xGODSTOMPERx,6,Mon Jul 6 22:31:50 2015 UTC,"Sigh. ""Stance"" is lame, but lowering with a practical reason is fine. Adding negative camber, especially in cases of 240s, 740s, and 940s is perfectly fine as it rounds out your tire wear, and plants you better in corners. Frankly, My girlfriend's 740SE handles so much better than it did before, lowered two inches and about one degree of negative camberlike this. It's tasteful, didn't detract from the ride too much, and what it has gained in stiffness, it has gained tenfold in handling, and safety. Before, if I broke loose in the rain, I'd tense up and freak out a little. Now it's very composed, doesn't plow hardly at all anymore and when it comes loose in the rain, it tracks where you point it. Stance is stupid. Modifying your car to fit your driving style in a way that looks sleek, and doesn't compromise the safety (vastly reduced contact patch in most stanced cars cases,) is 100% perfectly fine. That said, put a fucking muffler on your car."
Volvo,3ccaal,xGODSTOMPERx,5,Mon Jul 6 22:25:55 2015 UTC,It makes sense most Volvo people are gonna prefer function over looks.

Volvo,3ccaal,thefatrick,0,Mon Jul 6 21:25:30 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say all camber is useless, but yes anything past the magic number can be useless. That number all comes down to suspension geometry, car weight, and driving style. What do you think of this. It is classified as stance, but doesn't have the stupid camber and crazy stretched tires."
Volvo,3ccaal,AustinDAkens,2,Mon Jul 6 21:53:49 2015 UTC,Is Stance just extremely lowered vehicles then? I've always assumed it just meant you had camber as well.
Volvo,3ccaal,This_Explains_A_Lot,3,Mon Jul 6 22:02:25 2015 UTC,"Well normally you will end up with both. In reality to really get low you are going to need a bit of excessive camber to tuck the tops of your tires within the guard.   I personally dont mind it at all. I would not be happy if someone did it to my own car without asking me. But really why would i care if someone else did it to their own? I also think that people sometimes forget most stanced/heavily lowered cars are actually on air bags and ride beautifully on the highway (in most cases much better than standard).    It is the car world, it would be pretty bloody boring if everyone drove the same thing."
Volvo,3ccaal,ploppercon,0,Tue Jul 7 04:47:20 2015 UTC,"it's a mix of both. There are different sub sectors of stance, like being flush or ""hellalflush"". That is trying to have your wheels be as flush with the fender as possible. This may incorporate camber depending on the cars suspension set up.This RX7 is considered flush without going over board. When most people who don't really know much about the scene think about demon camber when you tell them stance, but those cars are ugly and useless imo."

Volvo,3cc0y1,fenderfreek,3,Mon Jul 6 19:16:12 2015 UTC,"I just replaced everything in there on my S60 (same basic procedure), so I can't comment about cleaning. I would say you want ramps, because there was a bolt that is only accessible from underneath. 99% can be done from above the car, so it's not a huge ordeal. I ended up tearing everything out again to replace a knock sensor, so I've actually done the whole dance twice in the last couple years.   Take your time, keep up with all the bolts in the manifold, and it will eventually come out. If yours has that one underneath like mine, you will need a good 12"" or better extension to get at it. Also notice that some of the bolts go through, and some are seat on u-shaped openings. You don't actually have to remove all of them, just a few of them, and all of them are fairly easy to get to with a universal and a short socket.  Be sure and clean the intake surfaces very well before you put your new gasket on with a knife and brake cleaner, and using a teeny tiny dab of grease on the corners will help hold it in place while you get everything lined up and put the bolts back in. Same thing for the hoses and stuff - a little smear of grease helps things go together.  It can be a long job the first time - it took me ~4 hours start to finish, but half that the next time around. Nothing is really tricky other than getting the manifold in and out - when you think you have all the bolts done , you probably forgot one.  Also, if you do decide to clean in the bay, just tape over all the inlets and orifices, but I didn't do anything more than hosing it all down with a little brake cleaner."
Volvo,3cc0y1,fenderfreek,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:56:55 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the advice.  Very helpful. What exactly did you replace when you did the job besides the pcv system itself?and for the bolt underneath,  is it possible to get at it without a ramp? Or should I just buy one?"
Volvo,3cc0y1,fenderfreek,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:32:40 2015 UTC,"I just changed the oil trap/box, all the hoses attached to it, and the intake manifold gasket. The only other thing under there was the knock sensor.  If you don't have ramps, a floor jack and a set of jackstands will get you enough clearance, but I can't really imagine getting at it any other way than underneath. Having ramps is convenient for most stuff, but if you don't have them, I'd get a good jack and set of stands first since they will do everything ramps will and then some.   For all I know, that one bolt could be something specific to the P2 model I have, but I haven't worked on any older ones, so I don't really know. If you take everything off from the top and it still feels ""stuck"" underneath (how I found out that bolt was there), then you'll have to jack it up. If you end in this position and have to jack it to crawl underneath, please do not get under the car without a set of jackstands under it (this may be obvious to most, but I'd feel bad if I didn't at least mention basic safety for working under a vehicle)."

If I remember correctly the teeth on the plastic gears can get damaged much like the odometer gear and the wiper arm gets misaligned.  Here's an FCP post about taking the wiper motor apart.  With it apart you can inspect the gears and replace any that are damaged.  http://blog.fcpeuro.com/2014/04/03/how-to-repair-a-volvo-headlight-wiper-motor/

Volvo,3bvhf5,somaganjika,5,Thu Jul 2 14:11:33 2015 UTC,Your bike will likely rev much quicker than a 5 cylinder motor. Check the throttle body though and see how much gunk has built up there and clean it with carb cleaner. That should help a bit.   It's also possible you've got a vacuum leak or boost leak that's affecting the throttle response but I would first start with simply cleaning it.

Volvo,3bv3n3,yuming7,4,Thu Jul 2 11:55:42 2015 UTC,It'll cost you roughly 1200 bucks.  Don't waste your money.
Volvo,3bv3n3,BoscoZebra,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:33:25 2015 UTC,To repeat what I wrote in the other thread:  I paid about 900 euros for my XC70 D5. It went from 185 to 205hp and lost a bit of sophistication in the process. Worth every penny.
Volvo,3bv3n3,illyndor,2,Thu Jul 2 21:03:30 2015 UTC,"He has a C30 - and here is the problem.   The C30 runs a torque limited automatic transmission.  You simply cannot make a ton of power at launch, the car won't let you.  I believe the rational is   for transmission life(tell that to the GNX, those only came in autos) and   to prevent torque steer or some nonsense.  Now, you gain a fair bit of power and torque , but it is only usable in 3rd gear and above- read highway speeds.  I drove my car  for over a year before I polestar tuned it, just to get good and used to the car- never had problem one putting on speed for passin. Now it passes ... quicker?  Wooty-freaking-doo.  Unless you spend a lot of time racing your friends at  speeds in the 80s and above it won't make much practical difference to you(me, most people, whoever).  The tune does nothing to shift points, so it's not even like it will make the car drive sportier - it just lets it make some more maxc boost  and  plays with the throttle response a little.  These things are .. kind of fun.  But 1200 bucks fun?  HELL NO.  If I could do it again I'd have spent 1200 bucks on a good set of tires and some sways. Maybe forgo the tires and do a full suspension refresh (springs/shocks/sways  or coilovers if I could find anything on sale) You will have WAY WAY WAY more fun with a tight suspension setup than you will passing people a little fast on the highway.  The cars are built to be comfortable - take a little comfort out, reduce body roll and some front/back weight shift  in the corners and the car is a lot more entertaining.  That's my 5 cents anyway. The polestar tune is fine - I have it, whatever, it's not BAD to have. It's just so not worth the money I spent on it.  If you really really just want a little more power then it will do that, but you should really consider some low hanging fruit to generally make the car more interesting before you go for those big dollar items with a slight gain."

If the car is warm (driven for about 10 miles) that is not a problem. If you mean dropping the clutch at 4k rpm from a stillstand, please don't do that, the clutch might slip or the drive shafts might give in, especially with a few miles on them.

Be advised though, your gas mileage will go to shit, especially if it's got a turbo.

First Volvo post for me:)  I got a 2013 V60 D5 AWD R-Design Automatic 2 months ago, and that car is growing on me like crazy:) First car i can drive for hours and hours without getting the least bit stiff. Driven about 3500km since i got it and a somewhat stable gasmilage of 6.5-6.7L/100km during 80% highway and the rest driving a bit silly and in city traffic. No complications yet, only a bluetooth issue but that fault is with my phone.  Its not the 4-cyl, but can say that the 5-cyl pulls really nice from stand still and during takeowers and the car i stable and a bit Boring on the highway( no drama, but that is what I was looking for in a highway cruiser so!)  I did find the trunk a bit small when hauling a lot of luggage and the distance between the hatch and front seats is a not short, approx 160cm.  But overall I love the car and it is by FAR the best car I have owned and in the top of driving comfort of the cars I have driven so far.  Would have liked adaptive cruise controll, but when buying used you are buying other peoples priorities:/"

One caveat is that it's very thirsty in town, not so much on the road. Very practical, comfort for long trips is the best I ever had in any car.

Volvo,3bgioj,AwesomeTreehouse,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:31:01 2015 UTC,"That's pretty much exactly what Volvo recommends. Stick with that. If it gets cold where you live start using 5w-30 in those months.  And like dixiekoko said Mann or nothing.   Also in terms of thickness of the oil your main concern is the second number (30). The old myth that synthetic oil is thinner than dino so it slips through cracks and causes leaks is bogus. 10w-30 dino and 10w-30 synthetic are both the exact same weight when up to temp. The synthetic just gets there faster. That being said the synthetic will break down slower so you don't need to replace it as soon as dino. When I run synthetic I will typically go 5-7k. That is very much on the low end but I figure it makes my old car happy and gives me piece of mind.  These cars aren't crazy picky. They do fine with dino, synthetic, or a blend. Just give them the proper weight."

Not a single thing rattles inside, not even on the rough roads of LA and San Francisco. I mean, it only has 73,000 miles on it so that might be why. But if I only have 73,000 miles on it, I at least have 127k miles to go. Although my long-term goal is to clock 300k.   While not quite as iconic of a design as the 240 and its various iterations, I see the first gen S60 becoming one of the ""classic"" Volvos in ten years. I mean, there's a reason Volvo kept essentially the same exterior design for 9 years. These days, there are very few car designs that stick around that long.  I'll say it again, congrats on that milestone! I hope you and your car have many years to come ❤️🚘  Edit: also like how you timed your trip calculator to hit 2.2 as well"

Just note these are kilometers, so the mileage is just 138k :)  And I so wish I'd realized to use T2 instead of T1 and waited to drive 22km/h at 22:22 with 2k rpm :)  She's a 2003 model S60, zero rust, the only problems I've had are the parts that get worn by driving (that's why I got replaced all of those). Well I had a relay box break, cost $20 to replace.  There was one glitch in the computer back in 2011 but it wasn't nothing a computer reset wouldn't help. The AC wouldn't turn off, every warning light got on and I couldn't lock the car doors."

Volvo,3az9ki,PabloBablo,4,Wed Jun 24 23:44:30 2015 UTC,"ARD is as reputable as any other tuner. A lot of the criticism was levied when they were selling their 'color' tunes. Now they tune for your individual set up. What it boils down to is, an ""off the shelf"" tune is never going to be as thorough as a dyno tune.  I'm satisfied with their customer service and I've got 20k on my tune with no issues. However, I just needed to reign-in the 19t. Otherwise I went conservative.   Although, the ""Bosch Motorsport"" criticism is valid. Lucky (once an IPD employee) seems to have inherited their habit of taking existing aftermarket pieces and claiming they're first party products."

Volvo,3az7ix,FrenchFryCattaneo,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:27:33 2015 UTC,You need to find out what kind of threads it has on the sender (I assume this is an electronic one) and then compare them to the threads on the oil pressure light switch (which you will be replacing).
Volvo,3az7ix,FrenchFryCattaneo,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:29:04 2015 UTC,It's a mechanical gauge. It seems the easiest option would be to spend the money on a VDO gauge
Volvo,3az7ix,hillbilly_trash,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:22:08 2015 UTC,Electric ones are much more convenient but if you're feeling motivated you can run a rubber hose from where the oil pressure light attaches through the firewall to the gauge.

Volvo,3az68j,selfishcoffeebean,2,Wed Jun 24 17:56:02 2015 UTC,"The headlight issue does seem like a ballast that is failing. You can find OEM ballasts on ebay for under $100 typically. It is pretty easy to remove the bumper and get the headlight out to replace the ballast. Ask your mechanic if he would let you supply the part to bring the cost down.  As for the tail light, it sounds like a poor connection. Perhaps the terminal inside the bulb socket is weak or the wires themselves are weak at the ends. Inspect the wires closer to look for loose connections, pinched wires, discoloration, or anything that looks suspicious."
Volvo,3az68j,needANon,2,Thu Jun 25 22:48:03 2015 UTC,"Thought I'd give you an update in case you were curious ... Pulled off the front bumper and the headlight assembly, ballast was totally corroded.

Volvo,3av4p6,xGODSTOMPERx,3,Wed Jun 24 18:33:02 2015 UTC,"Not the easiest car to do this on. Actually, one of the worst. The valve cover is also the top of the cam journal, since your car is a T5, it's going to have VVT which means you're going to need to lock the cams from the rear with a special locker, or fab up something to keep the cams from turning AT ALL from TDC, and pull those out as a unit. You will need all new head bolts. They are torque to yield bolts, and on whiteblocks are only one time users. You're going to need front and rear cam seals, head gasket, intake manifold gasket, exhaust manifold gaskets, etc. DO NOT USE RTV when reinstalling the valve cover. Use what's called ""anaerobic sealant."" It only dries in the absence of air. RTV will clog all of the oil galleys and starve the valvetrain of oil. Your existing head will need to be decked, and checked for cracks as well as shot valve seats/valves. Block will need to be cleaned thoroughly. To reinstall, you will need to torque the head in a VERY SPECIFIC MANNER. Consult the internet for that.  It's a cunt. A horrible cunt to do as a first head gasket, lots to fuck up, and lots of money to unfuck. Be wary."
Volvo,3av4p6,the_pinguin,2,Wed Jun 24 02:00:59 2015 UTC,"I've been looking at how to do this job and it looks very tricky, to lock the cam shafts I found this on amazon, hopefully it's the right one. As far as the head bolts go I'm getting these and using this torque wrench with this angle torque meter, as far as I understand I have to bolt the cylinder head in a circle pattern starting with 15 pounds, then 45, and then 130 degrees but I might be wrong. I saw a video where a guy used this product on the bolts to grease them is that product the right one?. For the anaerobic sealant I will buy this product, though I'm not entirely sure how to use it, I saw a guy that used it and another video where they installed the head gasket without anything, do I just spread the product on both sides of the head gasket and then bolt the cylinder head down? Apart from that I will be using this feeler gauge with the 0.004 inch to check the cylinder head and block for warping, I'm hoping it's okay but these engines are made of aluminum so it's probably warped and I will have to take it to a machine shop. That's all I have so far, sorry for so many questions I've never done this before, thank you."

Volvo,3ajm1u,JEH0VAHG0D,5,Sun Jun 21 02:36:28 2015 UTC,Around a $1000 for parts and then likely 8 to 10 hours of labor.
Volvo,3ajm1u,onewithoutasoul,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:40:36 2015 UTC,Hmm...2 grand is NOT that bad!!
Volvo,3ajm1u,JEH0VAHG0D,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:58:12 2015 UTC,No not that bad. For a lot of people that cost is prohibitive and may actually be more than the car is worth so that's also a consideration. If you ever sell it you won't be recouping that loss.
Volvo,3ajm1u,Caddyman18,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:03:56 2015 UTC,"Oh, for sure it would be worth more than the cost of the car, but I'm looking to keep my car beyond 300K miles, maybe upwards of 400K.  I'm only at 135K miles right now, which is nothing on a 98 V70R.  I really like it, and the interior is in great shape, no rust (so far).  When the automatic transmission goes, I'd like to put in a manual so I could look at putting in more horsepower--there's no sense in me trying to put more than 300HP in it right now because the auto transmission won't hold it.  But I know people that have been able to get 400HP out of these engines...if I could just get to 300-325 I'd be happy.  Right now cruising at 110 is a big strain, and the gearing isn't really right for good gas mileage--at 85/90 mph I'm getting 17-19 mpg.   That extra gear from the manual will pay for itself in gas, I think."
Volvo,3ajm1u,Caddyman18,3,Sun Jun 21 19:14:23 2015 UTC,"Where did you find your M56? I'm going to be on the hunt for an 850R soon, and I'd love to start collecting the necessary parts for a manual conversion."

Volvo,3ajm1u,JEH0VAHG0D,2,Sun Jun 21 02:48:01 2015 UTC,What year xc70?
Volvo,3ajm1u,JEH0VAHG0D,2,Sun Jun 21 03:00:52 2015 UTC,I'm afraid it's to new and there aren't any manual trannies in the us to make the swap.

Volvo,3akf9y,mysp00nis2big,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:28:41 2015 UTC,"Judging by the amount you're leaking your best bet would be to drop the tranny and replace the seal the right way.  I did just want to offer one piece of advice for whatever it's worth. My 92' 245 had been leaking from the rear main seal for a while. Not quite as bad as yours but bad enough that I was having to top off my oil every few weeks or so. In researching my options I found a company (Auto-RX) that sells a cleaner that does a good job removing sludge and can help with seal leaks. I want to be very clear that I would never advise anyone to use any kind of stop-leak-snake-oil-magic-in-a-bottle-bullshit. Ever. I did a ton of research into auto-rx and found enough positive experiences to at least try it. Mind you there are also some people who feel it doesn't do what it claims. You gotta take that for what it's worth too.  Anyway I tried it and it seems to have worked well. The leak has dried up. I can attest to some of the other claims as well. My engine is idling a little nicer and when I look in my oil fill cap it appears to be a little cleaner.  In the end I'm just one guy. The stuff worked for me, maybe it will for you too. Either way good luck with your issue."

Volvo,3ajrw3,atxranchhand,1 point,Sat Jun 20 21:54:15 2015 UTC,Actual polestar or a R-Design?  The Actual polestars are not available as OSD(Overseas Delivery) but R-design V60s are.  I actually did a V60 r-design OSD last year. It is a good deal if you have the time to do it.
Volvo,3ajrw3,British_Rover,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:18:41 2015 UTC,"The dealer told me they could arrange the actual polestar for osd, I'll ask when I see them next week. Do you think the extra money for a polestar is worth it? The r-design looks pretty darned close in specs."
Volvo,3ajrw3,British_Rover,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:24:14 2015 UTC,"Well it depends on what you are talking about exactly.   There are three different polestar optionsl  Polestar software only. 325 hp  R-Design which is the polestar software plus the suspension, interior and exterior upgrades. 325 hp  Full polestar with all 351 hp plus tons of other upgrades.  The second option can be done OSD. The first option can be done OSD plus port install of the OSD software.  The full polestar V60 cannot be done OSD. I know I tried to order one last year for a customer and I am also a Volvo dealer."
Volvo,3ajrw3,tarrbot,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:28:26 2015 UTC,"I am drawn to the ""full polestar"" option, but I also want to go to Sweden :/ How is the top spec r-design compared to the polestar in your opinion?

Actually one of the old inside line(edmunds) long term testers noticed this a few years ago(I think it was an s60). I think it's just a quirk as it's never mentioned anywhere. Possibly the lights but they get awfully warm from what must be a very small bulb.

Volvo,3acnto,HolePunch66,2,Fri Jun 19 14:24:02 2015 UTC,"Volvo 850 definitely is your best bet, and here are 3 reasons why:   Abundance - You can still find a ton of them in local junk yards and they made so many that the costs are still VERY low for the quality of car you are getting Parts Availability - There are several BIG aftermarket producers or OEM and replacement parts as well as upgrades and even OEM parts from Volvo are not very expensive. Reliability and easy to fix - These cars are very reliable and very easy to fix with basic tools. There are only a very small cases where special tools are required and most things are pretty easy to get to. Upgrade-ability - They made a BUNCH of versions and trim levels in the P80 platform (93-02). Turbos, displacement motors, FWD and AWD, configuration (coupe, convertable, wagon, sedan). You can bolt on tons of stuff, computer upgrades are easy. Community - I put this last because not everyone appreciates a car community (sometimes consisting of neck beards and flat brimmers) but the Volvo community on forums (Swedespeed, MVS, Volvospeed, Turbobricks, Volvoforums) are generally helpful and knowledgeable. Car meets can sometimes be avoided depending on what you are looking for but may still be worth the effort."

Buy the best you can afford.  850's are a huge leap above 7/940's in terms of mechanical complication, but the are not particularly complicated and offer higher HP levels in turbo form.  My current daily is a late 740 wagon with only 230K.  It much simpler and feels much more ""sturdy"" than my 850 Turbo wagon project car, but it feels...old.  Very old.  The 850 feels like a modern car to me where as my 740 feels every bit of its early 80's roots.   The B230ft also sounds like a threshing machine in comparison to the 850's smooth 20V 5cyl.   Mechanical parts are plentiful for all Volvo's but your source for soft parts like interior things will be the junkyard or used from some source.  850's have a huge advantage over all other models right now as lots are hitting the yards.   My local yard has no 240's and hasn't for years, 1 S60 and about 10 850's."

Volvo,3a83xl,steeborino,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:40:59 2015 UTC,"How much power are we talking about?  Stock your 850R would've come with an M59, basically a slightly weaker 5-speed compared to the standard ones but with a factory VLSD. These are quite rare as you can imagine but very nice in a stock configuration, the transmission itself can handle some power but the diff is the weak link.  If you want something that will be good for 350hp+ consistently then an M56 will be your best bet. This is the standard 5-speed manual that Volvo used with basically all FWD 5-cyl whiteblocks. There are a few differences between the model years but simply put the later the model the stronger the transmission. However the changes aren't that significant and pretty much all M56's will hold up really well. The drawback of the M56 however is that they never came with any sort of LSD, luckily Quaife make an aftermarket diff that fits the M56, and they are really strong so if you want a really good transmission this is the way to go, albeit slightly expensive.  Note that there are two different versions of the M56, the M56L and M56H, L stands for low gearing and H for high gearing. Here you can find the gear ratios of both the M56's and the M59: http://www.nordicr.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=11180"

And a few on support brackets at the front of the fender where the bumper cover mounts. Also 1 spot weld to the front valance that you will have to drill out.

Volvo,3a4t9j,SirTaamy,2,Wed Jun 17 16:03:23 2015 UTC,"Sounds more like it's starter related to be honest. A dead battery wouldn't let the car start randomly after a few minutes.   I'd suggest looking into issues with the starter or ignition switch to begin with, there are several things that could cause this, but your symptoms seem very similiar to one of the guys in this thread who had problems with his ignition switch: http://www.volvoforums.org.uk/showthread.php?t=6914"

Is it just the trunk, or the panels surrounding it too?  If JUST the trunk panel is peeling, I would pull the trunk, get some matching paint mixed, sand it down to metal, and respray. Or, pay someone to do it for you (it will be expensive but cheaper than doing the whole car). Clean, compound, etc the rest of the car to help it match.  If multiple panels are losing the clear coat... a respray is in your future. You could try doing the car with Plasti-Dip for now since it's cheap, easy to spray and goes over the existing paint. Then later you can peel that and repaint as desired. I guarantee a good shop will be able to respray it properly, but it'll be expensive. No Maaco prices here."

After test driving a ""normal"" c70 I felt the car was a bit pokey & had a syrupy throttle response with an annoying delay with tip-in. Then I test drove one with the reflash and it changed my mind about the car. Not only does the car move with more authority in the mid-range & top end, but the throttle response is much better. ( It can almost keep up with my Speed3, but it is still like driving a boat ).  Mind you, this does not make the car a rocketship, it just raises the performance to above adequate in my books, and makes that performance easier to access.   The only downside is that since the car lacks a LSD, it does torque steer a bit if you have the wheel turned & are giving it the beans. Switching over to stickier summer tires over the OEM all-seasons quelled that ""problem"".  I would imagine that in your lighter & more nimble car the difference will be even greater. I'd highly recommend having it done.  On a side note, you get a certification with you vehicle's VIN. If you ever sell it I'm sure it will add some value to your car."

As far as I know you shouldn't have any issues swapping out the ECC unit with another one, just be careful when popping the ""new"" one out to avoid breaking the fragile plastic along the edges. Also, unless you can confirm that all the lights work, consider replacing the 3 (or 4) bulbs that illuminate the panel while you have it out. One of them are often times burnt out and it looks alot better if they are all working.  When it comes to the exhaust bit I see no problems with simply replacing the muffler with a stock one, providing there is enough material to weld it on to and that you, of course, can weld. However, I'm not quite sure about this but the turbo models may have a slightly larger exhaust diameter (2.25"" instead of 2"" or something), so maybe check that out first.

I believe that the T5s are also stout. If I was buying between 08 and 10, I'd go for the XC70, because I love the way the look and their utility.  Good or bad, Volvo's seem to hold their value. S60 and XC60 and I think maybe another model are all on the same P3 platform so parts are generally interchangeable.  Again, speaking from a 2012 XC60, the AWD has been phenomenal.

And I've done all the work on my car myself. Being simple to work on however, is not the only thing to take into consideration when picking out a new car. What I meant with the V50 ""outshining"" the 240 is when it comes to stuff like comfort, handling, performance and gadgets/accessories.

The forums are helpful. I've done the pcv and timing belt just be on my 850s and it took time but I was able to do it successfully.   Things are straightforward, can be a bit cramped when working in the engine bay but not too bad.  Lots of YouTube videos and writeups for repairs. Check out robertdiy on youtube."

Volvo,39qomp,Robdiesel_dot_com,1 point,Sun Jun 14 04:14:34 2015 UTC,"So far haven't noticed any major difference. Same stuff, the things that are different shouldn't affect the repair. The things that are different will likely have their own write ups. If you know your way around an 850 you will know your way around an s60/v70."
Volvo,39qomp,tartilc,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:07:54 2015 UTC,"is there much of a difference between the P80 and P2 v70s   Yes, but not so much visually. We're talking similar engines.  The P2s have different communications and mount points, so seats won't interchange and radios won't interchange and things like that.   It seems the aftermarket is far larger for the P80s, but the P2s are catching up. The regular maintenance stuff is pretty similar."
Volvo,39qomp,tartilc,3,Mon Jun 15 17:45:05 2015 UTC,"I actually really like working on mine. It's complicated enough where you can tell it was engineered really well, but not too over the top into unnecessary territory. For example, the panels and connectors and such seem to be designed with serviceability in mind. The engine bay is the only place where it is a bit cramped, but its still laid out pretty well and easy enough to do things.  Like, I feel like if you had thorough instructions for even a pretty big job on these, you can do it, whereas with other cars it seems to take way longer than it should or you always run into brittle pieces, stuck bolts, or really specialized tool requirements.  Electrical wise, the early P2's (the ones you are looking at) had some issues with transmissions (2001-2002), DIMs (instrument cluster, 2001-2003, rarely occurs in in 2004s), and ETMs (2001-2003) I believe. Another common issue is the PCV valves, they usually should be serviced/replaced at 100k or so. The rest of the systems are pretty reliable, you don't hear about too many problems that aren't related to the ones above. 2005-2007 (facelifted) models are rock solid, with 2006+ models getting some mechanical upgrades too I think. Anyone else can chime in if I missed something.  Timing belts should be changed at 100k-115k, make sure that's done if you're getting a higher mileage model. There usually aren't many issues with gaskets on these cars. The water pump should have been done with the belt. Most other stuff can be taken care of easily. Suspension components are solid, I never needed to get anything done with mine apart from the usual bushings, sway bar links, and such.  I've owned two P2's so far. A 2003 V70 bought at 130k, needed a DIM at 150k (got done at Xemodex for ~300) and PCV was cleaned at 168k, but nothing else apart from oil changes and tires. Sold with 190k running beautifully. I currently drive a 2005 V70 bought at 84k, did my PCV preventatively at 90k along with the thermostat, currently need some sway bar links. Has 101k at the moment, running great :)"

As for your two choices, I'd say you should go for the XC70 :) Even though the P80 is very well maintained, the 2007 is a nicer, more comfortable and modern car overall, and its the most reliable P2. It looks like most of the major things have been done, the only one I can think of left is the PCV, but it's not too big, and you could maybe get the price down a bit if you ask the seller about it."

Volvo,39qomp,tartilc,1 point,Sun Jun 14 17:02:05 2015 UTC,"Hmm, if the older one is an R, that's a really big plus in the fun to drive category, but a pretty big hit on reliability. It's really fast and the suspension and seats are really nice, but the AWD has a lot of problems, and since it is a 2000, the ETM is a big issue.  The XC70 has an available Polestar tune (directly from Volvo actually, so its good) that you can get done that will improve the performance quite a bit (ARD or Evolve tunes can be done instead for less money though), and if you wanted to, you could put some better springs and struts on to stiffen up the ride and lower it. Depends on your preferences ;)"

(Unless you meant 5000, in which case disregard all of the above).  Check the usual things. PCV, radiator, heater core. Head gaskets usually aren't a problem, but make sure there's no oil/coolant cross contamination. Transmission may be on its last legs if it's original, keep in mind the cost of rebuilding or replacing that (the 5 speed auto of that era is prone to early failure). Check KBB and NADA to get an idea of what you should pay for it."

Averaged the equivalent of 46.2 mpg over our ~4,000km trip. Power is so-so with the D2, but was acceptable for average every-day driving. The idle noise wasn't objectionable, but obviously not a gasoline engine. Engine noise at speed wasn't really something I noticed, so it couldn't have been too bad!  The D5 will obviously have a lot more power, and higher fuel consumption."

Volvo,39gmnk,augustuen,2,Fri Jun 12 01:48:50 2015 UTC,Yeah it's the 185hp version of the D5. The automatic transmission lowers the mpg too. I get around 29mpg due to some top speed Autobahn driving on the weekends.  Anything over 31mpg is pretty much impossible.

The balance of performance and economy is excellent, I can cruise at 100 MPH all day and still get 36 MPG (~30 MPG in US gallons).  The D5 is a noisy engine and has been criticised for this by the motoring press for years.  I actually like the noise, it's quite a satisfying growl.  Later models have better insulation so the noise isn't as intrusive in the cabin.  The current 2.0 4-cylinder models I think are really quite refined in terms of noise, but what noise you do hear is a dreary 4-cylinder drone.  Then again, that's where every manufacturer is heading."

I only recently became a Volvo 244 owner myself a few months ago and am slowly starting to put together a spare parts crate for the trunk.  The P.O. just saved you a bunch of time and $$'s.

Volvo,39d48p,Pedalphiles,2,Wed Jun 10 23:27:50 2015 UTC,This could be a lot of things but sounds like ignition.  I would make sure it has Volvo OEM plugs (although that would be more likely to have issue sunder boost at higher RPM).  Also take the cover off over the plugs and check the condition of the wires between the plugs and coils (there are two coils as I recall).   Note this car uses a cable throttle so it is not the more common ETM issue seen with 5 cylinder models.  I think 2001 is the first year for the 5 speed auto in that car (in case that helps anyone responding).  But I'm not that familiar with that transmission or it's issues or if that might cause some of the symptoms.

It looks like he has a bunch done to it already (upgraded sways and whatnot.) It's way more fun to drive a slow car fast, than a fast car slow. The turbo cars will roast the tire (open diff sadly.) I suspect that one to be pretty quick, and it's obviously enthusiast owned. I'd jump, or you'll regret it. Awesome looking vehicle. If you expect it to drive as fast as the T5, you're going to be disappointed. If you remember it weighs like 2700 pounds, and has more low end torque than most tractors, and will handle like you would never expect, you will be very very surprised.

Volvo,394i0g,damn_jexy,1 point,Tue Jun 9 05:04:30 2015 UTC,Is the fluid topped up? If it is even a bit low it can start to suck air. Then it can need to be parked for a while to get the bubbles to dissipate. Can be a fairly high pitched moan noise. If topping up the fluid and ensuring the fluid is bubble free (not foamy in the reservoir) then you likely need a new reservoir as they are known to swell and start weeping fluid.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOUElRbsuQE

Volvo,393owe,Django_Starr,5,Tue Jun 9 01:05:01 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you have a short in your brake light circuit for sure. The trick will be finding where it is!  Disconnect the battery before doing anything.  I recommend pulling all 3 brake light bulbs and checking to make sure they (and the holders) in good condition. It could be (although unlikely) that one of them has failed in such a way as to short your brake circuit. If so, it's easy to check and fix.  You may find, however, that you have a wiring problem - one of the ""hot"" (non-ground) wires in the circuit is connecting to the body of the car (or other grounded point) and shorting out. The first place to check is the tailgate wiring harnesses where they pass through the hinge - they often wear out due to the opening and closing of the tailgate. That part can be gotten cheap off IPD if it is worn out, and is fairly easy to spot.  Otherwise, you may have to locate the offending wire with a multimeter. :("

Volvo,393owe,Admiral_Nopeton,1 point,Tue Jun 9 02:26:27 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I appreciate the detailed reply.  I've got a friend who has a tone generator, will borrow that to trace the short if the bulbs don't end up being the problem.  I plan on starting from the rear taillights and working my way to the front since I've no idea where the brake light wiring runs from front to back.  Any other brake light repair stories from anyone?  I've got a 244 sedan, what are the common areas where the wiring tends to give way over time?"
Volvo,393owe,Khrrck,1 point,Tue Jun 9 11:59:25 2015 UTC,"I didn't have a wiring issue, but both my bulbs had blown in such a way as to overheat and melt the reflectors. Replaced with LED bulbs since they're smaller. Fun times."
Volvo,393owe,Khrrck,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:42:19 2015 UTC,"I was able to get a bit of work done this evening.  I pulled up the carpet lining in the trunk and removed a plastic cover on the driver side near the spare tire.  The wiring runs through there, and right away I noticed a really corroded ground wire.  I cleaned that up and tested with a new 8a fuse in the panel.  The driver side brake light is working again, as is the rear window light, but the passenger side light is still out.    It started raining pretty hard so I had to quit for now.  Will get at it again tomorrow.   I noticed there seems to be some rain water getting into both tail light assemblies.  Should this be sealed up with a rubber gasket or something?"
Volvo,393owe,xGODSTOMPERx,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:37:27 2015 UTC,Both of mine have a foam rubber gasket. You can see it in some of the pictures here:  http://www.ipdusa.com/products/6784/111164-left-taillamp-assembly-240-wagon  I would buy a sheet of something like this:  http://www.amazon.com/Polyurethane-Open-Cell-Firmness-Adhesive-Thickness/dp/B003VYAXW2/  and cut it to fit.   The right bulb is probably just burnt out from all the shorting you did earlier. ;) Glad to hear it's getting fixed!

Volvo,393js1,Khrrck,5,Tue Jun 9 01:26:53 2015 UTC,"The immediate thing which I think of is pictures. There is no such thing as too few pictures on a Craigslist ad.  At the minimum, I'd say you want:   Photos which show all sides of the car.  A Craigslist shopper who can't see the right side of the car will assume there's something wrong with the right side of the car.  Photo of the engine bay. Give it a quick wash if needed. A clean engine bay looks great to buyers. Photo of the trunk (empty and vacuum'd as needed). Just to show it's in decent condition. Photo of the back seat (ditto) Photo of the odometer reading (not strictly necessary but some people like to see it themselves)   If you can drive it to a nearby park or lot with good lighting and no nearby obstacles to take the photos, it'll look even better. A good wash will make it look its absolute best but isn't strictly necessary.  As far as the text of the listing goes - list a few things that are wrong with the car. Someone who says ""car runs great, but needs an oil change soon"" or ""car looks great but has small paint chips on front bumper"" sounds a lot more trustworthy than someone who just insists the car is perfect.  Mention that it's a turbocharged 250hp car near the top of the listing. A lot of people won't know what the R in 850R actually means! It's a real beast as family sedans go.  Oh, and if you have any receipts for the parts you bought or repairs you had done, list 'em. People LOVE that.  Finally, post the ad to somewhere like Turbobricks.com or a local Volvo owners facebook group. Be sure to read the rules before posting, but those places tend to have people who are more performance-minded and therefore, more interested."

The kit came with all the underhood plumbing and parts, and the badge.  That said, it seems most later examples, '84 and '85 have the intercooler, so maybe they did start doing them at the factory.   No clue as to production numbers. All I can say is that of the 4 240 turbos I've had, two had the intercooler, both of those were '84. I don't know why, but it seems like all the high trim level (GT, GLT, Turbo, etc) 240s tend to rust worse than standard DL, which is probably why you don't see many of them.  Also, turbo buyers tend to be more abusive  :)"
Volvo,38tqpa,dixiekoko,1 point,Sun Jun 7 13:31:46 2015 UTC,Halfway through '84 and for all of '85 the intercooler came installed from the factory. You can tell these cars because above the Turbo badge is a smaller badge that says Intercooler. These factory Intercooler cars are an especially rare breed of an already uncommon car. And yes we turbo drivers are a bit more spirited. Thanks for responding! The hunt continues.  Edit: at least that is how my mechanic has explained it to me. I don't see very many Intercooler badges.

Planning on swapping out that massive 1974 rear bumper (when crash standards started to become more strict) with a roll pan across the back. Maybe going to paint the back of the trunk like this but satin black instead of gloss because it is a very similar panel shape to that so I think it would look nice.  Also there's a lot of electrical issues. None of the turn signals work, odo is out (not sure if mechanical or electrical), and the gas gauge doesn't work. No interior lighting except a few on the dash, and the hellas aren't hooked up yet.  Overall though, it's super fun. Had a blast putting it through the paces on a dirt/gravel road but the rear tires scrub on the fenders (despite being cut out) so I'll need to cut out the well, pull the fender a bit, and re-weld the well back to the fender"

Volvo,38qwg4,henryharp,3,Sat Jun 6 01:28:57 2015 UTC,"I do not own an XC90 so I can't offer much in the realm of tire experience on one, but I have always been extremely satisfied with Nokian tires. I have had their WRG3 all season tires on my 2002 S60, and they offered more than adequate grip in all but the worst conditions. On top of that they were quieter than anything I have had since, and helped the fuel economy on my car a little(difference of about 1.5mpg) due to the low rolling resistance. If you ever look into getting winter tires, I would never recommend anything but their Hakkapeliitta series. I have tried Blizzaks, X-ice, and Altimax Arctics on a near identical car to my 2002 S60, and there was no contest when it came to all around grip and peace of mind.  Depending on which tire, they can be rather pricey. Hakkapeliitta snow tires for my R were $220 each, but their zLine summer tires in the same size were only $112 each."
Volvo,38qwg4,Wolfpackomega,2,Sat Jun 6 03:18:10 2015 UTC,"I don't own an xc-90 either, but can recommend Nokian tires.

Although I use only studded ones in winter, I've heard great things about their non-studded winter tires as well. I think you can't go wrong if you get a proper set of Nokian tires.

I would put them at above average for tread life, but I have had better tread life on other tires. My Hakkapeliittas just finished their 4th winter, and I still have 75% of tread left. I put 600 miles on my 2002 S60 a week, but I also make sure to check and replace suspension components frequently, keep my tires at the proper PSI, and get alignments done at the proper intervals or if something feels off."

Volvo,38pnru,FrenchFryCattaneo,3,Fri Jun 5 20:28:42 2015 UTC,Check the fuel pump relay under the dash. My '79 had been spotty on start up and when I cracked mine open when it stopped running altogether the circuit board was charred. New relay and it starts better than ever. Replaced the one in my '89 as well and noticed an improvement starting also.  One of the common fuel pump relay comments you'll see on the forums is to keep a spare and replace it if it's more than 5-years old.
Volvo,38pnru,leersobie,3,Sat Jun 6 19:32:59 2015 UTC,I think this is the most likely culprit. Fuel pump relay failures are very common and carrying a spare relay is cheap insurance. The fuel pump itself (Not sure if yours has one or two fuel pumps) could also be the problem.
Volvo,38pnru,HarveySpecter,3,Sun Jun 7 22:02:58 2015 UTC,"Also, but a quality replacement! My '79 died in December and the cheap Chinese eBay relay I tossed in was trash. Picked up a used OEM relay and it fired right up. Now I keep a spare as well."

The car died again this weekend in the same manner, randomly while driving, this time I rotated all the fuses and it started right up.

Okay, it looks a bit dated (because it is, remember it was first released in '04 and received only minor upgrades over the years) but it works perfectly  - and that's what counts imho! Sometimes it chooses very different routes than other sat navs do, but usually for a reason. So far I've found those alternative routes to be just as good or even better (especially in cities) than those of other sat navs. The joystick controls and the UI need a bit getting used to, ok, but it's not nearly as complicated to understand as most people claim it is.

Volvo,38h4cu,TomT12,1 point,Thu Jun 4 04:21:05 2015 UTC,"Get a giant pair of channel lock pliers, grab the hose gently, and twist. It should break the seal and allow you to remove the pipe. This usually works with all hose connections, radiator, boost tubing etc."
Volvo,38h4cu,kronco,2,Fri Jun 5 03:22:14 2015 UTC,"I unhook the hooks that hold the airbox top on so it can be lifted up. Then lift it off and pull it off that hose.  By taking the top off the box you  get more leverage and can angle it a bit.  Also make sure the clamp is full loose.  After that the box pulls up to unsnap at the bottom and then  move it towards the passenger side to slide it out (there is a  guide pin into the driver side fender).    So I need to replace my spark plug wires, cap, and rotor    I've always found those parts make a big difference -- engine really likes a fresh rotor and cap."

Remove the passenger side felt, locate the relay and turn the key to see if it clicks. They're common no-start problems. Next step is to see if you can power the pumps directly by jumping terminals 5 and 7 in the fuse panel. Check the LH fuse in the engine bay, should be on the positive side of the battery cable in a white (probably yellowed now) fuse holder. Take it out, make sure it's not corroded.

Clean the area thoroughly so the paint sticks well - use a degreaser and then flush with plenty of water, and allow to dry completely. Then coat - I'd say a few coats of high-temperature engine paint should do it.

I recently had the radiator on in my car, it was $800. Factory brake pads for about $300 for the front axle, $150 for an off brand. I had the clutch go on mine, it was $2600. The car itself is a blast to drive, very comfortable and very fun. It will very much make you a car person if you're not one already. But you have to be ready for the maintenance costs."

Volvo,37ws18,calipilot227,3,Sun May 31 13:48:37 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a good buy. Check the PCV system (put a rubber glove over the oil filler with the engine running. It should not inflate), and make sure the timing belt was done at 70k. Everything else sounds like it was replaced when it should have been. Fair price for the year and mileage.  Edit: I scrolled down to see that you're taking out a loan to pay for it. Don't. If you can't afford to pay the asking price in full, you won't be able to afford to maintain it. :-( Sorry, but that's the honest truth. The good news is you can probably find a T5 for less, gets you more power than you can use on a public road, and the cost of maintenance will be significantly lower (FWD, no air shocks). Get an R when you're out of college and have some disposable income."
Volvo,37ws18,xGODSTOMPERx,1 point,Sun May 31 03:48:21 2015 UTC,"R's don't have air shocks. R's have Monroe 4C shocks. They are fluid filled, and use three buttons on the dash to control the ride. Comfort, Sport and Advanced (which also augments the timing, and ignition mapping giving a different throttle response.) T5's are indeed a lot of car, but finding one with a manual is difficult, and most, if not all are the M56. (5 speed.) I agree with not buying an R unless you have money to burn. I've seen one, driven HARD for it's entire life, and finally sold to a new home a 277k. Still running, and still kicking ass. That is most likely a one-of-a-kind situation."
Volvo,37ws18,calipilot227,1 point,Sun May 31 04:46:20 2015 UTC,"Thanks for clarifying. I knew the R had some kind of adjustable shock (didn't know if it was air or otherwise), which makes replacing them an expensive prospect.  Even a T5 auto is tons of fun, and has a much lower cost of ownership than an R. 5 speed models are out there, you just need to hold out for the right one.  Volvos in general are some of the most durable and long lasting cars out there, but shit still breaks from time to time. Parts aren't cheap, and neither is labor if you aren't able to do the work yourself (if you can learn and can put together a set of tools, you'll save thousands)."
Volvo,37ws18,K20CRX,1 point,Sun May 31 05:55:10 2015 UTC,"I said this a bit lower, but I'm mainly taking out a loan to build credit while I'm young.

Agreed to avoid AWD unless needed, and a good T5 will give you 90% of the fun of an R with half the costs.   That said, if you heart is set on one of the R-only colors (Magic Blue...nearly black dark blue, gorgeous--or Flash Green, because only the Swedes would make their fastest car metallic mint green), you wouldn't be the first to fall prey.  Seriously though, an R would have to be perfect with full documented history for me to take it over a well-sorted T5.  The later (05+) T5s got a 10hp boost, but even the early ones have plenty of kick.  If you want a manual, they were only available on the 2.4i (non-turbo, slow but reliable), T5 (2.3L with a high-pressure turbo, different and better block than the T5 put in the S40/C30/C70), and R."

My brother successfully ripped his front bumper off his 85 244 when he grazed and caught a pole in a parking lot. The bumper shocks held, but the actual bumper stretched and pulled through the mounting studs.  Between the bumper being made of aluminum and it being connected to the car via shock absorbers...I can't say towing it by the bumper would be a great idea.  I assume you have a decently powerful truck towing this, and if you have a trailer hitch I'd go to your local uhaul and get a two-wheel car dolly, one that locks one axle and has the other two wheels on the ground.

It does in fact have the original radio and speakers, and they are indeed crap. Do you or anyone else have any suggestions for replacements? I'm not looking to ruin the modest, subdued look of the stock radio and speakers.   Fuel pump I'm unsure about but I do know it has been well maintained and garage stored for the last 25 years.   The underbody currently has 1/4 inch of undercoating packed to it. There are however a few surface rust spots on the body that need a bit of attention.   Interior plastic and exterior chrome are in pretty fantastic shape, minus the adhesive breaking down on the chrome, separating it in parts from the body."

Hey, it's lasted my dad since '87."
Volvo,37ppqx,Admiral_Nopeton,5,Sat May 30 13:05:21 2015 UTC,If you haven't already I would go ahead and replace the regular wear items.   Fresh oil with a Mann oil filter (the only type you should use on your Volvo) New spark plugs and wires New distributor cap and rotor if it needs it New Air filter. Get the best one you can get. Mann filters are a solid option. Clean your throttle body and possibly your Mass Air Flow sensor. Make sure your tires are up to pressure   Your car will be very happy for it. If you keep up with regular maintenance your 240 should provide you with miles and miles of joy.  I'd also recommend you get your self a Bentley service manual or at least a Haynes. Both have been tremendously helpful for me with whatever issue I run into.
Volvo,37ppqx,Admiral_Nopeton,2,Fri May 29 17:34:20 2015 UTC,"Thanks for taking the time to respond.

Volvo,37ppqx,camed93,1 point,Fri May 29 14:43:26 2015 UTC,Most of the silver 240's I see are faded but they look really great when the paint is kept nice.  Yours looks great.  A easy  aesthetic mod is to plasti dip the square chrome around your front grill black. If I were to choose one maintenance job you should learn to do yourself it would be changing your own brakes.  Buy a simple trolley jack if you do not own one already. It may take you an hour to figure out how to do the first one but after a few tries you can get it down to less then 20 minutes a wheel.  Also the 240 tire iron that comes with your spare tire kit works great to push back the brake pistons.

Volvo,37snjp,lightcamera,3,Sat May 30 01:49:23 2015 UTC,The S80 is a big heavy car. City mpg will always suffer because of this.  I doubt a fuel change will help much but give it a try.
Volvo,37snjp,MrK9182,2,Sat May 30 02:10:43 2015 UTC,"The S80 is a large sedan; getting 29 MPG on the freeway is pretty good. The City/Mixed MPG will largely depend on:   Tire Inflation Type type (E.G. low rolling resistance, or economy) Air, Fuel, and Oil filter condition   The brand and octane of gas normally makes little to no difference. Since the 3.2 does not have a turbo, there is no reason to buy premium-level gas.   If you are looking to increase fuel economy, it is possible - I might be wrong on this point - that an after market mass/cold air intake and chipping might help.   Tips on how to drive slow:   Watch the instant MPG and try to keep it as high as possible Be slow to accelerate Keep the RPMs below 3500"

Volvo,37shsd,rootbeer_cigarettes,1 point,Sun May 31 02:32:39 2015 UTC,I'm guessing you've got some burned out lights on the dash? As coolant level gets low a warning will illuminate on the dash.  Aluminium motors don't handle overheating very well. I can almost guarantee the head gasket is ruined and the head is likely warped.  Both things are fixable but it depends on your financial situation and/or how handy you are with a wrench.    EDIT: This is not a job I would leave to Pep Boys though.

Volvo,37qnk7,NightOfTheLivingHam,3,Fri May 29 16:57:32 2015 UTC,Take the serpentine belt off and try to recreate the problem. The dash will light up like a christmas tree but you won't be doing any damage to the car.

Definitely get a bit more performance with them but not a huge amount, and they require MUCH more maintenance. If its just between the SUs and the Solex Id say SUs, but if you could get a Weber or dual, Id say go with that     Probably going dual webers soon.

Volvo,37ndk9,haydio,3,Thu May 28 23:35:04 2015 UTC,"I think so. Clean the area with a brush to make sure any loose bits are removed. Apply epoxy liberally. Ideally you want some not only in the gap between the pieces, but behind it and down into the housing to reinforce the joint. Try to avoid making it impossible to replace the battery! Do it with the fob open if you can. Let dry to full strength according to the directions before using.  Worst case you're down the cost of some epoxy and you need to replace it anyway. Worth trying."

I don't even remember the last brand of epoxy I bought, so just go with what's available (or highly rated on Amazon) and advertised as bonding to plastic. They should all be pretty similar.  Pretty much anything that's the right shape should work to start the car as long as the fob is close enough. If you want to get fancy, getting a local machine shop to mill a replacement ""key"" will last the life of the car and still probably cost less than $300. ;)  Nice Pusheen keychain by the way."

Perhaps you people should take better care of your shit, and it won't fail on you. 7/960s are nice, but totally different ball games from the 4cyl redblocks. DOHC, interference engine. They're good engines, and make decent N/A power, but they're eons more expensive than the Redblocks. Turbo motors, when maintained and not abused will last forever. Thats why you see 250k cars for sale on the regular. 7/9s are very similar electrically, both cars had similar options. I've gutted both and dicked with the wiring under dash, under carpet and engine bay. There's nothing someone with hands and a Bently manual can't do."
Volvo,37np6d,xGODSTOMPERx,1 point,Fri May 29 14:36:30 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with the point that people should take better care of their cars. We have a 940 with 4 cil Turbo engine, 350k so far. Original engine, original trans, original almost everything. Only the little usual things aren't original anymore. Still going very strong. Those engines are really reliable, but people should just put more love in them."
Volvo,37np6d,kevin38423198,2,Fri May 29 15:00:27 2015 UTC,"Shit, you can beat these engines to DEATH, and dump some oil in them, and you'll get them home. It's pretty hard to kill one. By 350k, they're tired, but the 740SE that has all those miles will still roast the  rear tires from a stop on dry asphalt. That's WITH a couple vacuum leaks I haven't fixed yet... I have a 78 B21 that has been beat on for years and it still will run itself out to 6500RPM and not blink."
Volvo,37np6d,xGODSTOMPERx,1 point,Fri May 29 15:38:03 2015 UTC,The HPT and the LPT are both 13C's.  Same turbo.  The only difference is the wastage actuator.  At least I think.  Maybe some early LPT ones were T25's.
Volvo,37np6d,hillbilly_trash,1 point,Fri May 29 18:04:02 2015 UTC,So what I'm hearing a lot of is if I find a decent 240 go with it over all others?
Volvo,37np6d,hillbilly_trash,1 point,Fri May 29 21:03:18 2015 UTC,"I run a 92 745T.  The difference between it and and a 940 seems to be the lack of a power seat, glass moonroof ( which I don't want...I fucking love the pop up metal one) and no squirters.   Squirters are the only thing that really make a difference.   My pistons rattle when the motor is cold.  Not terrible, but I can hear it plain as day.  Other than that...  Don't touch a 960 with a 10 foot pole unless you want to hate cars.     There is nothing to fear with the turbo.  Its a few extra bits, but nothing someone with internet access and a box of wrenches can't handle.  They are not magic at all.  Also, for $14 worth of stuff from Grainger you can make about 20 more hp very safely and easily."

Where as a 940 that, for all the world, looks like a 960 with a slightly different hood might go 400K with little or no fuss, a 960 will be broke constantly.  They are not at 850 levels of reliability either.  Most were poorly maintained due to expense and are knocking on deaths door.  Expensive parts.

Volvo,37h6lj,ericelectrik,1 point,Wed May 27 23:54:52 2015 UTC,"Volvo V70:       The Volvo V70 is a front-engine, front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive, five-door, five-passenger station wagon (estate) manufactured and marketed by Volvo Cars since 1996 and now in its third generation. The name V70 combines the letter V, standing for versatility,  and 70, denoting relative platform size  (e.g., a V70 is a larger car than a V40, but smaller than a V90).  The first generation (1996-2000) debuted in November 1996  as the wagon variant of the Volvo S70. Both cars were essentially redesigned Volvo 850s which had itself been available in saloon and estate configurations. The V70 was available only as a front and all-wheel drive estate, the latter marketed as the V70 AWD. In 1997 a special AWD version called V70 Cross Country, badged as V70 XC, was presented that went on sale for the 1998 model year.  The second generation (2000-2007) shared styling by Peter Horbury  as well as major mechanical commonality with the Volvo S60 saloon and used the P2 platform with a 4 cm increase in width and height, a 5 cm longer wheelbase, a slightly shorter overall length than its predecessor,  and a slightly increased interior cargo volume.  As with its predecessor, the second generation was also offered with an all-wheel drive variant which was marketed as the V70 AWD and as a special version called V70 XC, which for model year 2003 was renamed to XC70 .

Volvo,37dwyk,marlonthedog,-2,Wed May 27 01:22:31 2015 UTC,Reliability issues coupled with expensive repair costs.
Volvo,37dwyk,ronisolomondds,6,Wed May 27 01:39:07 2015 UTC,"If something goes really wrong, yeah it will be expensive.  The only times it's been expensive for me was when a part was far overdue for replacement.  Looking back on my three Volvos, the operating costs are about the same as my old Honda.    Periodic maintenance isn't terrible in my experience and sites like IPD, FCP Euro, VP Auto Parts and EEuroparts are great resources to buy new parts affordably.  With a good manual, I've found most repairs to be very straightforward and easy.  As to reliability, there are still many 30+ year old Volvos with north of 200k on the road in my area and I live in the heart of the salt belt.  I can't even tell you the last time I saw a pre '94 Subaru on the road around here; they've all developed head gasket problems or turned to rust."
Volvo,37dwyk,professor_tappensac,5,Wed May 27 03:40:16 2015 UTC,"I suggest a rwd model, those being (most readily available) 240, 740 and 940 series. Steer clear of 6 cylinder models, as they aren't nearly as tough/reliable as the 4 cylinder engines found in the base models. Also look for a non-turbo model; while turbo models are fun, many are old and abused. If you find a non-turbo that's running well, has been someone else's daily driver, and has service records for less than $2000 you're probably good to go. Parts are not necessarily any more expensive than for domestic cars, and are readily available from several online stores. Good Michelin tires are surprisingly cheap and high quality. Labor costs should also be minimal, as most jobs on these cars should be fairly simple for a good mechanic- simply put, older cars are simpler and less ""over-engineered"". This is why I have my pair of Swedes- I can repair a lot of things myself, saving some serious cash. Good luck on your search!"
Volvo,37dwyk,Admiral_Nopeton,2,Wed May 27 03:34:40 2015 UTC,"Your sources are right, Volvos are reliable IF they are taken care of.  If not, it dies.  What model?  I suggest a 240, having two of them myself.  However, if you want something a bit newer, check out the 850, the 740/760/780, or the 940/960/980 series."
Volvo,37dwyk,Hazelmaister,-1,Wed May 27 03:09:56 2015 UTC,"So unlike a honda or toyota where you can just put oil in every few thousand and forget about it, what else should one do to maintain a volvo?"
Volvo,37dwyk,Admiral_Nopeton,4,Wed May 27 03:56:42 2015 UTC,"Fluids, timing belts, tires... Pretty much everything that can wear out. Just  stay in the recommended maintenance intervals and do what is recommended in the manual. With basic maintenance those things run forever.

Volvo,37a6re,rootbeer_cigarettes,3,Wed May 27 01:12:58 2015 UTC,"EGR came on certain model cars and I can't remember if it was pre 96 cars or post 96.  You'll know you have EGR if beneath the throttle body you find a metal pipe running from the TB to the exhaust manifold.  To answer your other questions:  To diagnose a bad PCV system simply perform the glove test. With a warm, running engine remove the dip stick and place a rubber glove or balloon over the dip stick tube. If smoke is visible and the glove/balloon inflates you have pressure in the crank case and the PCV system needs to be replaced.  The procedure is the exact same for turbo's and N/A cars with some very minor differences.  The most important difference is the EGR. If your car isn't equipped with it the PCV replacement becomes marginally easier since its easier to move the intake manifold out of the way.  MVS member cn90 came up with a novel way to increase the performance of the PCV system by replacing one of the hoses with standard 5/8"" ID heater hose. You can read about it and the benefits here: http://www.matthewsvolvosite.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=53448  Robert's youtube channel is fantastic but I often times find its easier to see all the steps listed out with pictures. I followed this write up on MVS: http://www.matthewsvolvosite.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=28487  Sorry for the long post but this should cover most of your questions."

Volvo,370vc3,williewonkasan,2,Sat May 23 21:22:58 2015 UTC,"looks pretty clean for a '68 but look it over carefully and find out what has been replaced and when. If its not rusty then it might be worth it even if it needs an engine build. At that age most of the suspension/steering will have to be rebuilt- bushings, possibly shocks and coils, etc. Old rubber fails eventually despite mileage but you can probably get away with diving it for a few years. Just budget to invest in it for a few more years after you buy and you should have a very reliable and beautiful tank of a car. Ive had a '68 145s daily driver for about 15 years and I'm happy to answer any questions if it helps.   edit: I should add, I am my own mechanic and the only one who has worked on the car, if you have any interest in DIY its about as simple and built to service as any front engine RWD can be. I have rebuilt about everything on the car at one point. Best of luck!"
Volvo,370vc3,williewonkasan,2,Mon May 25 01:39:03 2015 UTC,"Turns out someone else in line to check it out before me ended up buying it :( But this is all really good to know, I'm looking for one of these or one like it, just a tank that I know will last, so really really appreciate the insight. I have limited knowledge at this point but I'm definitely interested in DIY/want something I can learn with.  If you have any specific volvo models to look out for, I'm all ears! Thanks again man"
Volvo,3711w0,bertolucci,2,Sat May 23 21:37:22 2015 UTC,1) are you sure you have the right brake pads?  2) when I did the front brakes on my 940 I remember having to use a screwdriver to help push a rubbery springy sleeve back in to allow the caliper into place.   Can you post pictures?
Volvo,3711w0,urlefthand,1 point,Sat May 23 22:24:42 2015 UTC,"Did you get this sorted out? I agree, did you get the right pads?"
Volvo,3711w0,AldenM,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:14:21 2015 UTC,"Yes I did, my apologies for not updating.  It turns out that with a few solid whacks the lower guide pin bolt ""sleeve"" is able to be pressed back into the swinging caliper half. With the thinner, worn out pads in place the swinging half of the caliper was able to close properly, and the sleeve's clearance wasn't an issue. I am still not exactly sure how the pistons pressing against the worn pads would cause this sleeve to shift outwards, but that was the case.  here is a picture of the ""sleeve"" that was giving me trouble, you can see where its a little bit worn from me trying to force the caliper back in place. Once I pressed it back in (rather, whacked it into place) the caliper re-assembled as it should.   Onto the next issue: recently (after a few weeks of driving) I've developed a squeak from what i believe is the front brakes. I liberally applied brake grease to the backs of the pads, and guide pin bolts, so this is slightly frustrating. Brake operation was completely silent for a few weeks, however now with slight brake pressure i can hear an ugly squeal. It doesn't seem to matter if the brakes are hot or cold, and with moderate to hard braking there is no squeal. It seems that steering also influences the squeak, and sometimes i can hear squealing without the brakes applied (low speed only)   Did i wear my wheel bearings while removing the wheels during this procedure? Do my pads need to be worn more to avoid contacting the rotor with wheel bearing play? i understand there is a slight amount of play incorporated into the bearings. I would regrease the pads and calipers, however I'm afraid that removing the wheels again would only make the play worse. However now that i think about it torquing the lug nuts on or off is minuscule in comparison to road forces.  any thoughts??"
Volvo,3711w0,AldenM,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:48:01 2015 UTC,Did you check your wheel bearings for play? Do you have the newer style with the separate hubs and bearings or the older with the bearings in the hub? Did you take the rotors off? You could try retorting the hub correctly but I can't remember what you do exactly. It's a torque + angle.  What kind of pads did you buy?
Volvo,3711w0,AldenM,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:32:52 2015 UTC,"I bought genuine Volvo pads for front and rear, which came in a blue box with hardware (little clip things situated over the pads).  When the front end was supported, I was able to wiggle the wheel slightly, while holding the tire at the 12 and 6' o'clock position. Looking back the wiggle could have just been from the lugnuts being loosened, but I'm pretty sure the hub itself was shifting. I did not remove the rotors.  I believe I have the older style hubs, since my brake configuration corresponded correctly with the service plate ( code 3, bendix front with ATE rear). IPD's brake guide strongly suggested checking whats actually on the car as opposed to trusting the service plate, because a previous owner could have swapped brakes or made other modifications. My current, original brake configuration leads me to believe the hubs are original too, but I could be wrong. Were some 85' 740's assembled with 2 piece hubs?  I do have significantly more brake dust on the drivers side front wheel than any other wheel, which is where I suspect the squeal may be coming from. The pads appear to be properly situated in place, from what I can see with the wheel on. This squeak is intermittent, but occurs often enough to be worth mentioning.   I've never re-packed the bearings with grease or attempted to tighten them, seems like a logical first step. The first owner bought it new and sold it with 184,000 miles, Ive owned it for about 7 years and am currently at 211,000. I'm not sure how often bearings require maintenance, or if the previous owner did any himself. Thank you for your reply."

Volvo,3714mg,staufinc,1 point,Mon May 25 15:16:32 2015 UTC,Honestly you should just do this first. its almost guaranteed to be a bad solder in the abs module.
Volvo,3714mg,Khrrck,1 point,Thu Jun 4 06:46:03 2015 UTC,Is it something I can do myself? Coincidentally enough I'm soldering on a new capacitor for my tv in the next day or two
Volvo,3714mg,Mahnja,2,Thu Jun 4 11:20:01 2015 UTC,"Try removing the ABS module, cleaning the terminals with contact cleaner and reinstalling it. Don't forget to disconnect the battery when doing electrical work.  If possible take it to an auto parts store or Volvo dealer and ask them to read the codes for you. They should be able to do it for free and the codes will give us a better idea of what's gone wrong."
Volvo,3714mg,Khrrck,2,Sun May 24 01:48:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply, I'll try that.  In response to the code reading I took the car to an auto zone a few days ago and they told me that they could only read the code if a check engine light was on. I might try an actual volvo dealer as well though"
Volvo,3714mg,The_Walking_Dad,2,Sun May 24 03:02:02 2015 UTC,A Volvo mechanic will have the vadis/vida Volvo interface that can clear the codes...if you know any good local Volvo mechanics. He can also tell you what the codes mean
Volvo,3714mg,The_Walking_Dad,3,Sun May 24 19:28:29 2015 UTC,"ok, thank you! I'm gonna take it to the dealer then in the next day or so"
Volvo,3714mg,johnwilson1969,1 point,Sun May 24 19:43:31 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, ABS sensor failure generates codes... but I'm not a mechanic. I know that the S70 definitely had problems with the ABS module though. The contacts get tarnished, and the internal board may develop cracks in the solder joints and need to be refurbished or replaced."
Volvo,3714mg,sixsixeightsix,2,Sun May 24 05:00:42 2015 UTC,"4 years ago I took out the ABS unit of my 2001 v70, resoldered the PCB (easy) sealed it with rubber caulk. Never had ABS/traction light again."
Volvo,36zbzc,AzureBlu,3,Sat May 23 12:07:10 2015 UTC,"You can plug in a simple Aux adaptor in to the back of the stereo (cd-changer input). You'd have to remove the stereo to access the back and possibly drill a small hole somewhere convenient for the cable to exit.. It's really not a hard job at all, should take you 10-15 minutes tops.. Adaptors in Sweden cost about 500-700:- SEK but if you are elsewhere I'm sure you can find them on e-bay or something similar.."
Volvo,36zbzc,MorrisStratos,3,Sat May 23 12:43:05 2015 UTC,I am in fact in Sweden :) (volvo masterrace unite! etc)  What adaptor exactly am i looking for?
Volvo,36zbzc,MorrisStratos,3,Sat May 23 14:10:02 2015 UTC,"http://www.auxadapter.se/ är ett populärt alternativ, har goda omdömen på diverse volvoforum.. Lite skum betalningsmetod då jag har för mig att man för över pengar till ett Nordea konto istället för att få någon faktura eller liknande. Nu står det inte explicit att den är testad på HU-611, men jag skulle sätta en 5:a på ett den funkar även där..  Installationsguide: http://www.auxadapter.se/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Installation-AUXadapter.pdf  Här har du ett annat alternativ (lite dyrare) från en riktig e-handel där det klart och tydligt står att den passar även på HU-611:  http://www.dnbilradio.se/produkt/Volvo-HU-Radio-USB-o-AUX-interface"

Volvo,36zbzc,MorrisStratos,2,Sat May 23 16:22:53 2015 UTC,"I can recommend the GROM-BT3. It works well, is easy to install and was a lot cheaper than getting a whole new stereo unit. I ordered mine from here."
Volvo,36zbzc,Hood5307,1 point,Sun May 24 14:53:46 2015 UTC,I would just buy a whole new stereo. That's what I'm doing with my 05. I found out that there are harnesses avAilable that you can hook up to the factory stereo but they cost quite a bit. And almost all of them are 30 pin adapters for the older apple products so you would need to get another adapter if you have a newer apple product. By then you're spending about the same amount as a new stereo with all the harnesses that let you utilize your steering wheel controls and the amp in your car.
Volvo,36zbzc,MorrisStratos,1 point,Sat May 23 13:05:40 2015 UTC,"Adaptor will run you like 80 dollars, way cheaper than changing headunit and have to worry about getting it to work with the Volvo speakers.. Granted, the downside as you say is steering wheel controls won't work.."
Volvo,36zbzc,Mahnja,1 point,Sat May 23 13:10:44 2015 UTC,Like I said tho. The adapters are usually for 30 pins that only work for Volvos. Buying another adapter for that is about 30 dollars. But then you would be better off with a new head unit. Which I bought mine for $100 with everything I needed.
