I know its difficult to say that they don't deserve to die especially in some cases, but there should always be that chance of repentance/forgiveness. Healthy people often don't understand someone who is mentally unwell (which i'm not suggesting all murderers are) but there needs to be a chance for that person to get better and truly understand what they did. By giving someone who is mentally unwell the death penatly doesnt seem like justice to me. I would want that person to understand what they did wrong.  It shouldn't be about money. Its peoples lives and its difficult to say a murderer deserves these rights when they have taken them away from someone else but an eye for an eye is not how the justice system should work. IMO."

Patricia Stallings was convicted for the murder of her infant son by poisoning him with antifreeze (ethylene glycol).  She was sentenced to life in prison, and shortly after the conviction discovered she was pregnant.  When that child was born, it was discovered he had a condition known as MMA Disorder, a genetic condition that, on the surface, presented itself as antifreeze poisoning.  It took forensic testing to prove her first son also had the disorder and she was eventually released from prison.  Forensics got her convicted, and had she not been pregnant, the forensic testing that exonerated her would never have occurred.  She was imprisoned for 2 years before being cleared of all charges.  http://justicedenied.org/patriciastallings.htm  Bonus mystery:  Why doesn't this case have a Wikipedia page?!?"

So I'll try to guess what you mean by ""starches, glycogens, sugars, etc"".   Most high profile Serial killers were not caught due to forensics. They were caught either in the act, due to other criminal activity (speeding, theft, burglary, etc.), witness testimonials, confession or being turned in by partners in crime.   There are some exceptions:    The Atlanta Child Murders Case: Wayne Williams was convicted based on forensics taken from his dog, his truck and himself; to see if any of it matched fibers found on the victims bodies.  Green River Killer: Americas most prolific Serial killer, Gary Ridgway, was caught due to DNA taken from victims and linked to Ridgway (he was interviewed as one of hundreds of other suspects many years before DNA- evidence was commonplace; so they only linked him to the murders over a decade after the first interview). BTK was caught because he was bragging about his crimes to the police, using a floppy disk they could trace back to him. They then used his daughter's DNA to compare it to BTK's semen left on bodies decades earlier. These two pieces of evidence resulted in his arrest and eventual confession. The Norwegian Serial killer Arnfinn Nesset (suspected of over 70 murders, convicted of only 27) was convicted due to a match with the overdose of Curacit (a muscle-relaxing drug) found in victims and his record of ordering large amounts of said drug. He never confessed to his crimes and is now living as a free man somewhere in Norway under an assumed name (he served only 14 years or so in prison)."

serialkillers,3dubxx,generalwalrus,3,Sun Jul 19 15:36:06 2015 UTC,"I live near the area. It's a small town under most standards, but it's one of the largest towns in an otherwise rural area so it gets a lot of traffic. So the population of the town itself is only 22,000, but because it's the only major city in the county, many, many more people from outside the city visit, work, and shop in Chillicothe daily. This is pretty common when you live in a county with lots of tiny rural townships and one larger city -- the main school is there, the courthouse is there, most grocery/shopping is there, and many people drive from their township to work in the city. Like most other similar sized cities in Ohio, there is a heroin problem. Drug scene is pretty big. Considered overall to be an incredibly boring community. I can't think of a single reason I would live, work, or visit Chillicothe tbh. They have a couple of Indian mounds and a live Tecumseh play, but not much else in the way of attractions, and not great for hiking either as the area is flat and mostly farms. I'm pretty surprised prostitution is so big there, though.   I would be surprised if it was a serial killer doing all this. It is a very small community and these deaths have gained quite a bit of attention. Not a good environment to avoid detection, and Chillicothe is an area where everyone knows each other's business. If these girls were involved in drugs and were hooking for drugs, it's more feasible that they crossed with a dealer, owed someone money, etc. Although I believe some of the deaths were cleared as a suicide or overdose. Lots of ODs due to the ridiculous rise in heroin use. When people OD on heroin around here, their friends are often reluctant to take them to the hospital because Ohio likes to charge fellow users with murder/manslaughter/whatever for providing drugs or helping inject the fatal dose. So there is a high incentive to dump a body...even if it wasn't your fault the person OD'd, you can be charged with complicity in their death."
serialkillers,3dubxx,Osu712,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:00:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah after reading a bit further, I think you probably right. Maybe just a bad strand of heroin that these girls are getting and whoever is with them when they OD doesn't want to be fingered as the source of the original girl who OD'd.."
serialkillers,3dubxx,bbooze,3,Mon Jul 20 10:58:03 2015 UTC,"I hadn't heard of this case before. Some thoughts on your thoughts. 1) A serial killer is a single or tandem killer who kills 3 people over a period of time that includes a genuine cooling off period. If there is no cooling off period, than they are considered spree killers, or mass murderers. The crimes don't have to have anything in common for the perpetrator to be considered a serial killer. 2) In this case, I imagine police did not go into serial killer panic mode and start watching street corners because suicide and accidental deaths really do follow around drug addicts and prostitutes to a noticeable degree. It sounds like they are only waking up now to the realization that some of these deaths/disappearances are possibly the work of a serial killer. Also, prostitutes don't necessarily just stand around street corners anymore, they were possibly working through Backpage or some such site. 3) The theory that they may have been off'ed for having been witnesses to some other crime is intriguing. I tend to be skeptical of such motives though. Most serial killer motives boil down sexual sadism, or just outright thrill killing. It's not unheard of for a drug organization to kill potential witnesses, but it's rare. It's something that seems to be way overrepresented in tv and movies as a motive for a spree of killings. Plus, if this is a crime group covering it's tracks, we would expect to see at least as many male victims piling up as well... it seems like a long shot that only these women had knowledge about some activity by some theoretical Big Bad, and now he's taking care of business by off'ing them one by one. I'll definitely follow this case, this town/city/whatever is going to have a bad reputation for sure if it didn't already."

serialkillers,3duf3r,fondlemeLeroy,3,Sun Jul 19 16:06:51 2015 UTC,"Filipović was the chief guard and administrator of the Jasenovac concentration camp, where an estimated 100,000 Serbs, Gypsys, and Jews were exterminated during WWII. This camp was so brutal that it even horrified the Nazis. After an official visit, General Edmund Horstenau wrote that ""these camps have reached the height of hideousness here in Croatia, under the Poglavnik [Ustasha leader] installed by us. The greatest of all evils must be Jasenovac, which no ordinary mortal can glimpse.""   After ordering mass on Christmas 1942, Filipović slit the throat of an inmate after forcing him to sing a song, then shot 40 villagers in the head. He admitted to 100 murders at his trial for war crimes, but is believed responsible for much more. A former prisoner describes an average day in the life of Filipović -   ""The priestly face of Fra Majstorovic, all made-up and powdered, dressed in an elegant suit an green hunter's hat, watched with delight the victims. He approached the children, even stroked their heads. Fra Majstorovic told the mothers there will now will be a baptism for their children. They took the children from the mothers, the child whom Father Majstorovic was carrying, in his child's innocence caressed the painted face of his killer. The mothers, distraught, perceived the situation. They offered their lives for mercy for the children. Two children were placed on the ground, while the third was thrown like a ball into the air, and Fr Majstorovic , holding a dagger upwards, missed three times, while the fourth time with a joke and a laugh, a child was impaled on the dagger. Mothers began throwing themselves on the ground, pulling their hair, and began to shout terribly. Ustasha guards of the 14th Osijek Company took them away and killed them. When all three children were so brutally killed, these three two-legged beasts exchanged money, because they seem to have a bet on who would the first to stick a dagger in a child."""

They told her how Nannie had said the baby was dead, and they noticed she was holding a pin. However, the doctors could not come up with an explanation for the death. After this, Melvina and Mosie drifted apart and Melvina began to date a soldier. Doss disapproved of him, and while Melvina was visiting her father after a particularly nasty fight with Doss, her son Robert died mysteriously under Doss's care on July 7, 1945.

There's no proof he ever killed anyone and it's very, very, very rare for a serial killer to have more than one captive at a time. Even killers who do keep victims to torture them before death (like Berdella) usually kill the previous victim before hunting for a new one. The only two killers I can think of who ever captured a victim, then went out and kidnapped another while the first was still alive are Bundy and Heidnik, and Heidnik is just barely a serial killer as it is.

It's been a few years (jeez, over 10 actually), so my memory of the events is not great. But I have had an avid interest for serial killers since the late 1990s, and I remember quite well reading the then-called ""the crime library"" (part of ""tru TV"" today) online about various serial killer cases.   I particularly remember reading about BTK (this was early 2000s, before he was caught, so the entry was just ""BTK"", not Dennis Rader). It was a very long article and at the end, it finished With something along the line of ""we may never know who BTK is, no murders attributed to him has been seen for over a decade. It may forever be a mystery."". I remember this, because the next week, someone had added ""or will it?"". This, it turned out, was because (citation from Wiki follows) in May 2004, a letter containing chapter headings for the ""BTK Story"", fake IDs and a word puzzle were received by KAKE. On June 9, 2004, a package was found taped to a stop sign at the corner of First and Kansas in Wichita. It contained graphic descriptions of the Otero murders and a sketch labeled ""The Sexual Thrill Is My Bill"". Also enclosed was a *chapter list for a proposed book titled ""The BTK Story"", which mimicked a story written in 1999 by Court TV [then Crimelibrary] crime writer David Lohr. Chapter One was titled ""A Serial Killer Is Born"" *.   About two months after this, Dennis Rader was caught."

I also enjoyed ""The Night Stalker"" by Philip Carlo and ""The Bundy Murders"" by Kevin M. Sullivan. However, both became a little boring at the end which was mostly about the court trials.   ""The Hillside Stranglers"" by Darcy O'Brien was also nice but also focused a lot on the struggles between the two killers.  Even though I'm not really into court trials, the book ""Defending Gary"" by Mark Prothero was an interesting read. It is written by the defense attorney of Gary Ridgeway (Green River Killer). It was less about actually defending Gary (in the sense of ""he's innocent"") but more about getting Gary to confess the murders and lead them to the corpses to at least avoid death penalty.  I also have a book about Dennis Nilsen but I stopped reading it because I became extremely bored after a while."

serialkillers,3dh60p,askryan,9,Thu Jul 16 06:29:09 2015 UTC,"There's also Internet Slavemaster by John Glatt, author of Cries in the Desert (David Parker Ray).   John Edward Robinson was a 56-year-old grandfather from rural Kansas. An entrepreneur and Eagle Scout, he was even honored as 'Man of the Year"" at a Kansas City charity.   Sound familiar?   While living in Springfield, Gacy became involved in several organizations that served the community, including the Jaycees, to which Gacy devoted most of his efforts and was eventually a vice-president and named ""Man of the Year"".   LPT: Anyone who's been named ""Man of the Year"" is a serial killer."

In 1977 he talked his way onto the board of directors of a local charitable organization and forged a series of letters from its executive director to the mayor of Kansas City, and from the mayor to other civic leaders, commending his generous volunteer efforts and generally singing his praises. Eventually he had himself named the organization's Man of the Year, and threw a festive awards luncheon in his own honor.   He was an* accomplished fraud."

She stopped to look up at him.  “I’m saying I think you should fuck them and take their virginity. Break their hymens with Snuffles. They’re all our children, and I think you should make them ours even more.” ""  And Homolka is not living a life of wealth and luxury?

serialkillers,3dguf3,bearfossils,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:23:55 2015 UTC,"I have a very large extended family, one of my cousins recently was jailed for knowingly having HIV and not informing his multiple partners. Apparently he gets around and isn't choosy. He's a straight male for reference. It caused a HUGE uproar in the area I live in and tons of women were getting tested. They ended up releasing him roughly 1-2 months later as he hadn't infected anyone. They managed to get a subpoena for his medical records. Not what you usually think of as a serial killer in the standard way. I've had issue with him for a long time so I was mostly worried about my Aunt and keeping her together during it all.  I have another cousin who's in federal prison for crossing state lines and molesting his sisters child on a military base. Oddly, I feel more empathy for him because everyone knew something was wrong with him. My uncles first wife and this guys mom is really a messed up person so I think he went through trauma. My uncle finally got custody of the kids and took him to therapists etc but we all kind of knew don't leave kids around David and that David is kind of a loose cannon he's definitely mentally deficient. Would I let him be around my kids? No. Do I still love him ... Yeah I think so.  If one of my boys ever grew up to become a serial killer I have to honestly say I wouldn't abandon them. My love for them is unconditional however, I wouldn't condone what they did. I would make them face what happened as much as I am able to. I would be sickened and sad and torn to bits but I would still love them.  Just for the record I have ~20 first cousins and they all have kids etc. So most of my family is really boringly normal. It's just the two. My family is extremely open about showing loving emotions towards each other. No one really fights or regular family drama. It's pretty peaceful except a couple of my cousins."

serialkillers,3dguf3,Bailliebugs,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:14:18 2015 UTC,"My first action would be to immediately contact the police and turn in the person, regardless of how I felt about them; even if I had unconditional love for that person, I recognize that LE should know and that person should be arrested. Killing people is one of those dealbreakers for me.  That aside, my emotional/personal reaction would probably depend on a few things – if the person in question was suffering from a mental illness that wasn't being treated or hadn't been diagnosed, if the person had come from an abusive home or suffered some kind of severe trauma, what kind of killer they were, how close I was to that person, etc. If it was a family member that had a debilitating mental illness and wasn't competent or ""sane"" when the killings happened, and if they were getting psychological help or trying to get well, sticking with it, and were remorseful for what they did (once/if they were stabilized and could think rationally), for instance, I would try to support that person as best I could. On the other hand, if it was some family member who was a sexual sadist and was completely aware of right and wrong and just didn't care, I would cut off all contact and they would be gone from my lives. Regardless of what they did and why they did it, though, I would try my best to get any and all helpful information from that person for the victims. If there were bodies that hadn't been recovered or a murder they wouldn't confess to or some facts that would aid the victims and their families in any way, I would try to extract that information any way I could in order to help. I think as a relative, it would be the least I could do to try and compensate in any way for all the pain and damage someone in my family caused. If I wrote a book about that person and their crimes, or was on a show about it, I would donate any and all profit to either the victims’ families or to a relevant charity. I don't know if I would be able to do that, though – I think I would feel like I was being exploitative, if that makes sense."

I would change my name. If I were close to them, I'd still write them in prison, and visit before their death (if they were sentenced to death), because I wouldn't feel right about leaving them like that.

However, his second and third books delve so far into ludicrous theorizing and outrageous claims (trying to pin the Zodiac murders along with numerous other infamous murders, like the Lipstick Killer case, on his father) that they completely lost me. He still delivers some compelling circumstantial evidence as far as the Dahlia murder, but that's about as much stock as I'd care to give his claims."

I think Kilroy was a fraternity member but it was all over the news. They found him in a mass grave and it was pretty sad. I don't know why people from Austin are always getting picked off by serial killers in the 70's and 80's when I was a kid. I think it's the whole Austin hippy trustworthy vibe. I don't know. Just off the top of my head Henry Lee Lucas shopped in Austin as well as Kenneth McDuff and a few spree killers as well like the sniper in the UT Tower. His wife taught at my junior high when it was a high school. There were stupid rumors of a ghost. I mean if I were the ghost of a typing teacher the last place I'd hang out would be the place I worked especially if it was full of snarky kids and smelled like stale tater tots

serialkillers,3cxw1y,BrianW1999,15,Sat Jul 11 23:28:50 2015 UTC,I agree. The only interesting thing about him is his enormous kill count. 75+
serialkillers,3cxw1y,askryan,24,Sun Jul 12 01:57:23 2015 UTC,"I'll play devil's advocate — he was, to me, always one of the more interesting and chilling ones out there (perhaps some credit is due to Ann Rule's Green River, Running Red, which I kind of prefer to Stranger).  First, I think it's the ""normal guy"" thing that interests people with BTK — that a regular, almost anonymously boring guy that you see at church or the flea market is chipping away at the sum total of human life — even moreso that a mythical figure like the Green River Killer (who I've heard became sort of a boogeyman figure for young people in that area), turned out to be just the banal truck painter and swap meet enthusiast down the road who loved to kill as many people as possible. He didn't kill to avoid paying hookers; he killed because he liked it as was good at it. He didn't have a horseshit remorse story like Dahmer or a horseshit Christian conversion like Berkowitz  or Tex Watson or a horseshit abuse story like Shawcross — he just liked killing. And he killed so. many. women. Reputable estimates put his total over 100, maybe over 200 — we'll never know, since his plea deal is only in King County and if he admits to any murders outside it he could face the death penalty.  To me, the idea of a normal, boring, dumb guy with a stupid mustache so evil that he kills a small college's worth of people, but so good at hiding it that no one suspected for thirty years is as terrifying and menacing an occasion to touch darkness as it gets.   I also find him a interesting indictment to Bundy (who attempted to help profile the GRK before he was caught, documented in Bob Keppel's excellent Riverman)— the use of prostitutes aside, he was so much like him in most respects. The disarming, friendly affect, the emphasis put on blending into the specific community of the victims, the surprise use of force, the dumping of bodies in clusters, the postmortem mutilation and necrophilia — hell, even the geographic region. Bundy thought he was special; people interested in SKs think he's special, but he's Ridgway with a better education, slightly higher socio-economic class, and a third of the kill count. He pathology is so similar — my guess is that while Bundy was fascinated with the GRK and the connection they had, he would be broken to see a reflection in Gary Ridgway."

I have a friend who's gotten a masters in Statistics and the probability is 34k to one that this would happen to someone.  The first was directly after I broke up with my abusive ex husband. I knew the guy in high school and knew he had a ~170 IQ I was so starved for attention that I just let all the weirdness wash over me. I would see him lie all the time to other people about strange minimal things. It was a short relationship and I found out I was pregnant about 2-4 weeks after he took off. I told him I was pregnant and he asked me if I'd consider an abortion. I couldn't for several reasons (yes we used protection he has 7 other kids. Yes that's right SEVEN) so maybe he's just super fertile. Fast forward to after the baby is born his ex wife contacts me via FB and says she's been following what happened and wanted to help me with medical info and to tell me she's sorry. She was the one who told me he'd been diagnosed as a psychopath or sociopath. It's strange because he was very good with my son, not violent, and made sure I had food etc before he left. However, he was an extreme narcissist (and yes he was extremely handsome) and lied easily, didn't connect but was a fairly good actor. I've not seen him since. His ex wife and mother of 6 of his kids hasn't heard from him and neither has her children in years. I know there's a genetic component to psychopathy so I am extremely careful not to traumatize my 4 year old son and be very positive and loving with him. He is genuinely very sweet as a child so now it's just wait and see.  Second man was after my second son was born. I'm guessing I'm on the psychopath mailing list by now. He shows up in my life and loves everything I love, is enthusiastic is the life of the party. Both of these men were like this. Just wanted to turn my life around and would rearrange my furniture and crap while I was at work. He talked about marrying me and adopting my son. He was way too perfect. I worked funnily enough as a dispatcher for the local Sheriffs department. He loved going to my work, bringing me dinner and talking to the officers and the Sheriff. He never felt perfectly right. He was too perfect.  He had a ""job"" and would go to work and send me photos but told me never to call his job because it wasn't allowed. He talked constantly. He was extremely extroverted and pretty much left me exhausted all the time. My family and friends loved him. Thought he was nerdy (I am too but he was far nerdier) but a great guy. Then one day my land lady came to my door and said she hadn't received rent for 5 months. Yes, it's a small town and my land lady is old and sweet and doesn't charge me if I'm late etc. Well, since I was working 12 hour shifts and had two small boys he was doing most of the household crap like paying bills. I'd give him money and he'd pay. My daddy was watching my boys while I worked as he wanted to spend time with them and I think he's the only person who didn't feel right about either guy. We never fought except he would blame bizarre stuff on my older son. Things my older son wasn't physically able to do. Anyway, I call him about the land lady freaking out as you would do and he said he had the last receipt with him and would get off work early and bring it home so we could show my land lady.  He comes home with a hand written receipt out of a book just like always. I gave it to my land lady who seemed troubled and said she'd go through the books. I paid rent at one of her businesses she owns and the receptionist always writes out my receipt. One night or two nights after he said he had to go on a big instillation of a network in a neighboring town and his boss was picking him up and he didn't need my car. The next morning I woke up, he was gone, all my money was gone, most of his clothes were gone and he left his library books and card neatly on the desk.  I called his work they said they didn't know who I was talking about. So I panicked and called my crazy ex husband for some reason. Ok he's crazy but gets stuff done and is very intimidating. He calls the place of business and explains what's going on. The owner of the computer store said he'd come in looking for a job but they had no openings. He'd hang out and talk shop with them for hours.  We called the city police who I knew all of and it was indeed embarrassing. They took a felony report against him found a pawn receipt in his coat pocket where he pawned my psp and my camera erasing all my photos of my kids. I took the day off work, hacked into his side of my osx and found he was researching bus ticket prices to Florida as well as online dating sites.  My dear sweet landlady came up to my work the following day and told me that the receipt didn't match numerically. I collapsed weeping into her arms crying and told her everything. She said it was ok and just pay a little extra every month. My friends sent me money. Lots of them. It was all very public and humiliating. Luckily, as I said before I was a dispatcher so it was like having 30 + very angry older brothers. Not one of them had a clue he was a psychopath not even the sheriff. Found out he was wanted in 3 states for doing the same thing to other women. Had a long sad talk with his completely normal wealthy family who live in another state that he has indeed been diagnosed as a psychopath. He was very very good at it. Victimized two other women after me then the pressure was too much and he turned himself in. He did ONE year in jail. It was pathetic. His mom wanted me to help catch him so whenever she got an address I'd pass it along and one of my coworkers with a badge would call Florida and tell them they had a fugitive and where he was. Florida did zero to apprehend him.  He's married now. He's not dangerous except he's a thief and habitual liar. I'm lucky very very lucky that neither of the men I dated were violent (that I knew of) but just were psychological screw ups.  I'm exceedingly painfully careful when I date now. I feel sorry for the men I date because I over analyze everything they say and do. I began noticing the same behaviors in several inmates we had as well. I think I can generally pick them out now, but i'm still sadly very untrusting and thankfully the men I've dated since have understood why I don't think the way most women do and why I'm suspicious. I must be the only suspicious female that's not worried he's cheating but that I've attracted another psychopath.  I've asked normal mentally healthy men if I was putting off a desperate vibe or something, they say no but the fact that I' so open and easy to talk to may be the reason why I have been a target. Sorry this was so long and neither of them were serial killers but I have had very intimate relationships with 2 psychopaths and no one died. I just got screwed over. A lot."

serialkillers,3cyf0t,sherribobbins,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:18:18 2015 UTC,"I used to joke that I'd win the lottery for sure but only if the prize was a punch in the face. After those instances one if my co-workers would run NCIC on guys I dated (it sounds like I date a ton, I don't. I had a 3 1/2 year relationship with a much younger guy after that and it didn't work out and now I'm just beginning to date again) to make sure they're not fugitives. The guys(and women)  who work for state investigative branches have all the seriously cool tools. A guy I knew came in and used a program that would change his password every 30 seconds it would text it to him if he wanted to log in. I gave him ex sociopath/ father of my son's info as a challenge after getting past security it spewed out about 40 pages of EVERYTHING I mean bank accounts, residents, relatives, neighbors, associated friends. Everything it was scary.  By the way I do have an NCIC clearance with the FBI but we can't just run whomever we want we have to have a person request the III and then log all information. I've seen weird stuff on III's but you know I can't talk about it. FBI and all. I know I have an FBI clearance but I don't know what level. Probably fairly low lol"
serialkillers,3cyf0t,AnalLeaseHolder,5,Wed Jul 15 22:16:19 2015 UTC,"If I'm telling you a story about one of my crimes, it's gonna be in the past tense the whole time because it happened already. That seems more normal than someone telling me a story of what happened as if it is currently happening."
serialkillers,3cyf0t,PangurBanHammer,3,Sun Jul 12 15:30:59 2015 UTC,"I thought the same thing, until I thought about how we often tell stories. Yeah, the past tense is used a lot, but you also see people saying things like, ""So I get home, and the next thing that happens is..."", describing it as if they're there currently.  So I guess it makes sense, but at the same time, if someone asks me ""What happened"" or something similar, I'll likely respond in the past tense. Still seems a bit odd."
serialkillers,3cyf0t,whitneycat,3,Sun Jul 12 16:25:44 2015 UTC,I think this is fascinating.  I'd noticed some of this myself in watching interviews with serial killers--interesting to see that it's a real thing.
serialkillers,3cyf0t,Psychopath-,2,Sun Jul 12 02:34:21 2015 UTC,I doubt the credibility of anyone who doesn't know the difference between flat affect and lack of emotion.
serialkillers,3cyf0t,toomanyfrogs,3,Sun Jul 12 16:47:15 2015 UTC,"Since there are bound to be folks here who also may not know, would you be able to clarify?"
serialkillers,3cyf0t,Psychopath-,6,Sun Jul 12 20:13:45 2015 UTC,"Affect has to do with emotional display. A flat affect means the individual has no outward display of emotion or they appear detached from a situation that would normally evoke a strong response. This is why sometimes people describe sociopaths as appearing cold and I think it's why sociopaths get the reputation of being emotionless. A second issue that adds to that is the fact that sociopaths have fairly high arousal thresholds for things like excitation and fear, so that gets reinterpreted as sociopaths feeling nothing at all, which is untrue and a common belief of people who've gotten most of their information from media or popular science."
serialkillers,3cwr4f,djblur,6,Sat Jul 11 13:10:00 2015 UTC,Great interview but take what he says with a grain of salt. He lied about lots of killings.  I also don't believe he was a serial killer. He was a professional hitman that killed for money.
serialkillers,3cwr4f,BrianW1999,3,Sat Jul 11 18:42:05 2015 UTC,I agree. Not sure if committed all the murders he said he did.
serialkillers,3cwr4f,BiscuitCat1,3,Sat Jul 11 23:45:58 2015 UTC,Yeah he could be making stuff up and there's no way to prove it...but technically a serial killer is anyone who kills more than 2 people
serialkillers,3cwr4f,PangurBanHammer,3,Sun Jul 12 07:42:55 2015 UTC,"Legally speaking, he is indeed a serial killer, unless there's some aspect of the law that disqualifies one from being called that if there's payment involved."
serialkillers,3cwr4f,HoChiMiner,2,Sun Jul 12 19:06:24 2015 UTC,"I think there is a difference between a hitman and a serial killer psychologically and legally. One kills for money, the other kills for pleasure, whether sexual or the powertrip or usually both.   I get that he may have gotten some pleasure out of killing, but that main motive is financial gain.   I've just never heard of mob hitmen being considered serial killers before"

serialkillers,3cwb1z,Seatac_SFO_LAX,2,Tue Jul 14 07:28:30 2015 UTC,I love the sad swelling emotional music and Bundy's single little tear. It's not for kids being addicted to porn it's because he knows he's about to die. He was SO good wow! I remember I was snowed in at a friends house along with other friends kind of like a co-Ed but innocent slumber party when this happened. I was a senior in high school and we all watched and cheered when they pronounced him dead. It rarely ever snows in Austin it was all kind of surreal but a very deep set memory. That is possibly when I started being into serial killers. I had read horror fiction before but Bundy's execution was a very big deal and we all sat huddled in blankets in my best friends living room in front of the TV on a snowy January night and cheered when he died. What a weirdly vivid memory.

serialkillers,3cty77,nihilo503,5,Sat Jul 11 02:25:25 2015 UTC,"So, this is a bit strange, but my mom went to high school with your mom. I remember first hearing about Ted Bundy and my mom telling me that her friend from high school was the only person to have escaped from him. Also, we watch some movie about Bundy and when the part with your mom came on my mom again explained that she knew her.   I should say, I don't know if they were close or just went to the same school."

I've read just about everything there is on Bundy, and have read a lot about your mom's experience and testimony. Thank god that she was brave enough to speak up and testify. She was incredibly important as a witness.  Also, I'm glad to hear that she has been able to move on and live her life. I can't imagine going through something like that. I'm glad she was able to be there for you as well.  Quick question: is that picture of his car in some sort of museum? I've never seen that pic before.  Thanks again!"
serialkillers,3cty77,rexella,21,Fri Jul 10 20:14:33 2015 UTC,Yes it is in the Crime Museum in Washington D.C. Went there once in person and really it gave me a perspective on what my mom went through and how lucky she was.
serialkillers,3cty77,derpina_is_a_mermaid,5,Fri Jul 10 20:17:23 2015 UTC,It gives me chills that you saw the car in person that your mom was almost kidnapped in. Thanks for sharing your story. I'm glad that she (and thus you) lived to tell the tale.

I have been in a few situations, and I know my fellow female friends have too, where we ignore our own instincts in favor of not being rude or impolite. It's important that all of us learn to trust our own intuition. I'm so glad your mother made it out of there alive.

To get away from this guy in the situation she was in always struck me as nothing short of a miracle. I mean, she was a very beautiful girl, and luck, as you say, was truly on her side that day. Thank the stars that door never opened when Bundy said it was a sub-station? I always reckoned he had that place observed and was sure it was open. He gets there with your mum ... its locked!!! That threw him. All the bluster from there on out, Carol Da Ronch becoming sus by the second? Sure she said he was a bit drunk too at the time? Anyway, if she had not been so on her game, we would not be having this exchange!?!

Also has your mother ever said how she felt when Ted managed to escape after your mother helped put him in jail, was she giving any police protection in this time, I'm guessing she must have been petrified that he was on the loose.  Ps my 7 year old female cousin was abducted here in Ireland in 1977 & has never been found, I think that's where my fascination with this subject comes from. (Even though I wasn't even born at the time)  Tell your Mom a big hello from Ireland and much respect for her bravery."
serialkillers,3cty77,ColinZealSE,2,Sat Jul 11 05:38:54 2015 UTC,I showed it to her a few years back. She was extremely offended by her portrayal and says the whole movie is inaccurate to the events that occured in his killing spree.
serialkillers,3cty77,ColinZealSE,4,Sat Jul 11 15:02:42 2015 UTC,"Ugh, that movie was awful.  In bad taste, and I thought the actor who played Bundy did a pretty terrible job.  I mean, Bundy's whole thing was that he was charming enough to fool everyone.  That actor played him as a dribbling loony (which may have been true on the inside, but that wasn't how he presented, hence his ability to charm women into going with him).  That said, I thought your mom's character in the movie came across as pretty badass--when she was punching him in the car I was yelling ""good girl!"""
serialkillers,3cty77,ColinZealSE,3,Sat Jul 11 17:26:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah she didnt like that part too much.

She was phenomenal on the witness stand. She conveyed so much resolve and stared Bundy straight in the eye and told him she knew he was the man who kidnapped her. The defense and media tried to shake her up because Bundy looked so different at the time of trial vs. the kidnapping. But, she knew what Bundy was and she just shrugged her shoulders and stated that in fact, he looked completely different every time she saw him.  For an 18 year old woman to confront and understand sociopathy so well was not only impressive, it helped save lives."

serialkillers,3cy37d,Soperos,19,Sat Jul 11 20:39:28 2015 UTC,Lots of people here seem sympathetic toward Dahmer. I've posted a couple times on how absurd and unreasonable that is but I've kinda given up on that.  Sounds like your nephew has his head on straighter than he maybe gets credit for.

serialkillers,3cy37d,BlackMantecore,3,Sun Jul 12 10:42:17 2015 UTC,"I think people are sympathetic to Dahmer for a few reasons. I'm not gay or anything, but he was a handsome person. He had that sort of ""baby face"" and he was excellent at manipulating emotions.   Maybe I let my post drag on too long to get to my actual point, and it got muddied in that. What I'm really asking about, is if people feel sorry for serial killers getting executed. That's it."

serialkillers,3cy37d,Aleksandra_Sokolova,2,Sun Jul 12 04:16:07 2015 UTC,"Yes, I think the resources spent on execution and housing criminals could be used for trying to understand why these kinds of people exist in the first place. I don't buy into the whole ""some people are just evil"" narrative. I believe people are made to become killers, not born that way. Broken homes with detrimental family and societal dynamics are probably the leading factors for most of the crime and violence being committed. Serial killers are most likely the perfect storm of environmental influences and genetic predispositions."

Why would you not show him pictures of the victims? Why not tell him about Louise Bundy and her role in Ted's development? And the point when even she bailed on him during his trial? I think you could have simply asked your question of us without the nephew story. It's by no means clear he's a ""softy.""  That said, it is absolutely true that many serial killers were tormented, beaten and even tortured during childhood. (Not Ted, though). Most slipped through the system many times, all had red flags--so one might feel they suffered and deserve sympathy, millions of children have had horrible childhoods and do not go down this path.  If you're ""torn"" about it, go read the details of serial killer victims and what they went through; look at the pictures. Listen to the tapes of them being tortured. I think you haven't looked into the reality of serial killers closely enough."

Of course, I was like that too and I brought a knife to school to attack a fellow student at 14 and was arrested for arson at 17, because my life is one big psychopathy cliche. I guess the idea is that most kids that go on to have problems show signs early, but not everyone who shows those signs go on to have problems. And I think we do a huge disservice to kids who would be okay by telling them at that age that they're not right and socially unacceptable. But maybe that would be weighed out with better outcomes for the kids who could benefit from early intervention. It's a difficult question and I went tangentially off-topic, sorry. In any case, I'm more or less useful to society now, though my motivations are likely skewed a bit. That should count for something, even just a little."

serialkillers,3cy37d,Psychopath-,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:51:54 2015 UTC,I made a post earlier about how I've dated two sociopaths/psychopaths in the past just a few moments ago. I'm not trying to be glib. I'm glad you've found a way to be honest with yourself and others and be productive. I know not all diagnosed psychopaths are killers or violent but can be manipulative and deceiving. I'm really happy for your ability to take this in stride and be the best person you can be. I have a long term anxiety disorder that I've been told will be with me forever and it's kinda severe if I'm not medicated so I know the responsibility it takes to make something so stigmatized and own it and do the right things. Thank you because I've been victimized by a couple of psychopaths. I joke that I'm in your quarterly newsletter as an easy pick but honestly I wonder if there's something about certain people that makes you feel like they'd be easy pickings? Thank you for your time. I know I'm off topic but I wonder. I also have a son who's biological father was one of those men I spoke of and I'm terrified he will inherit the genetic disposition. How early did you begin to display or feel different and was there a trauma that induced it? You don't have to share the trauma it's just that my son is 4 years old and I don't want him or anyone else have to suffer because of his fathers DNA
serialkillers,3cy37d,sherribobbins,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:56:58 2015 UTC,"I think in my situation it was a combination of genetics and environment. I was adopted when I was three out of a situation that wasn't great. My adoptive parents are really decent people but kinda behind the times when it comes to psychology, so there wasn't any idea of getting me therapy or anything. I grew up very much understanding that you just deal with your problems and get the fuck over it. And my biological father was undiagnosed but from the information I've found, he fits the criteria for ASPD, at least. I knew I was different as long as I can remember, but it took awhile to quantify it - to put a name to it. I have a daughter now. I hope I can give her a stable enough early environment to negate some of the damage that comes with being genetically half mine.  People are easy marks when they're insecure and naive. There's an old saying about how you can't con an honest man that sort of applies. It's much harder to manipulate a skeptic, and even where possible is rarely worth the time, effort, and potential fallout.  I'm a contributing member of society because I have reasons outside of conscience to be one, but I don't have any illusion about what I'm comfortable doing if those reasons change or stop existing."

There are good points you could become a fantastic actor, politician or salesman. Once again I'm not making fun these are professions that people who have sociopathy excel in. I sold furniture for a year. I was the worst salesperson of the chain in my city but they kept me because I was warm and people trusted me unlike my kind of cold off putting coworkers who made the big numbers.  I do try to be more conscious now of who I see. I was so destroyed by my marriage and so eager for attention that may have put off a bit of a scent. I joined r/sociopath after you mentioned it. I'm lurking but if I need to can I pm you in the future about my son or something? Honestly, I'm also afraid to fall for another sociopath. I know the odds are not in favor but I could do it again. I don't know what I could do in return since you're probably not interested in my emotional input. Anyway, let me know and I really wish you and I both the best of psychological roulette with our kids!"

It's not like he says ""I'm going to kill someone"" but more things like ""I was playing GTA and it was so cool, I shot this guy and his head practically exploded"" type of stuff. To which I would say ""Okay, but you know the line between a game and real life right?"" ""Yeah but it's really cool. Also shooting them with rocket launchers, etc etc etc"". He doesn't talk about hurting people.  I've looked into the reality of serial killers a whole lot. You shouldn't make assumptions you know nothing about. Your entire post is one long assumption.   The only thing I am torn about is the execution. I'm not saying they should get away with anything. Maybe you misunderstood my post.  Let's not forget one of the people there at Bundy's execution, when speaking about the people celebrating said ""He was still a human being"", I guess you should tell him details of his crimes. I bet he doesn't know lmfao. On the other side of that someone else that was there said ""I wish I could have pulled the lever myself"". Maybe you should stop making assumptions and just give your opinion on the topic instead of trying to start an argument? Because people who were a lot more close to the case than you and I ever will be were clearly torn on it. So stop being a know it all. It's ugly.   Also, this is not a private message."
serialkillers,3cy37d,Mrs_Fonebone,3,Sat Jul 11 22:09:22 2015 UTC,"This is directly in response to your question about serial killers.  But let's leave it at this: Human beings vary wildly in their behavior. And when you do some deeds, you cross a line; you are too dangerous, too toxic, too inhuman to remain in society--and in the world. You're a monster. By your argument Hitler, of course, was a human being, and so was Pol Pot and so were Myra Hindley and Ian Brady and all of the other monsters we have captured.  To say that ""being human"" means they deserve sympathy when that is a mere DNA question, is meaningless as an argument. I know many people do feel sorry for them, want to marry them, write to them etc and all of those people -- I will go out on that limb--are in denial about what a serial killer is and does. I think the corpses should be present in the courtroom, in their coffins or with pictures of their remains so that they do not get lost in the rush to make sure nothing ""prejudicial"" is shown to the jury. Sociopaths don't want your sympathy--unless it helps them to get what they want. They don't feel it, they don't understand it.  I did give my opinion. I'm free to disagree with you; if you consider than an argument rather than my right to state my opinion, then that's your problem."
serialkillers,3cy37d,Aleksandra_Sokolova,5,Sat Jul 11 22:31:38 2015 UTC,"I'm not using ""they were still human beings"" as any kind of argument though. I'm not saying they don't deserve the death penalty. I've never felt any kind of guilt for them or what they went through at the end, but what he said did make me give it a second thought. I thought about it purely from the perspective of a human being about to die, and nothing else. I'm not saying Bundy shouldn't have been executed. I'm not saying I think he should have gotten life in prison instead (especially considering he escaped twice and went on to kill both times). I'm just saying it made me feel torn.   You are taking a lot of what I say, and twisting it to fit your point. Also, I didn't ask for an opinion on my nephew, as you know absofuckinglutely nothing about him. That's where you annoyed me. That's why you got the tone. If you can't see that, well, then that's your problem :)"
serialkillers,3cy37d,Mrs_Fonebone,2,Sat Jul 11 22:48:38 2015 UTC,Good post.  I'm a writer and I'm going to work on a series of stories a boy who hunts down people with violent fetishes over the internet and then outs/doxxes them and sends the information to everyone they know IRL for their protection.  I've seen some fucked up drawings of serial killer level stuff.  My friend Alex tells me there's no way anyone can be into that without having very serious psychological problems.
serialkillers,3cy37d,Staybreezie,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:02:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks. And your stories sound interesting. People like to believe serial killers are strange looking monsters who just appear out of nowhere. The FBI profilers and other groups have confirmed there is a path they go down, just like all people, to get to their adulthood and their virtues and vices--addict vs good parent vs heath care provider vs gang member etc."
serialkillers,3cy37d,Mrs_Fonebone,2,Sun Jul 12 19:32:28 2015 UTC,"Part of it is the male character is really pissed at the male privilege of jerking it to drawings of women being murdered.  It's fucked up because that shit actually happens, and they deserve to have their fucking lives ruined by having every person they know IRL get a friendly heads up about what they masturbate to, so that maybe they can experience 1/1000th of what real girls go through in the last moments.  TBH I feel like doxxing these people would actually make them more likely to offend.  IDK.   The type of psycho who would probably would end up getting to the point of acting anyway."
serialkillers,3cy37d,xxx_Jenna,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:26:58 2015 UTC,"Agree; it really seems that the people around the male kid have a serious responsibility to know what they're doing and ACT. Dahmer is one example, where his dissection of animals was known, his grandmother smelled all that stank in her trash cans but never followed up. At the time when Ted Bundy says he was having his worst ever year, starting college, his mother separately said that it was the happiest time of his life. There are so many parents who can't be bothered to learn what their children are doing online.  I read some advice that any computers in the house MUST be in a public area--the family room, kitchen, etc. but NEVER in a child's room. This would at least stop reinforcing violence = sex and v.v."

They think it's fun to go troll some lunatic on Tumblr, their plan leads bad people back to them, and it turns out that their shitposts about their interest in the Wehrmacht make the a lolcow and their entire existence is spent under a magnifying glass held by psychopaths who document everything about them in a defamatory dossier.  Kids don't understand privacy online and that there are areas that they just shouldn't get into.  I've seen some fucked up shit on Live Leak and I came across a real fucked up picture taken by a serial killer in high school.  When you're that age it's easy to think you want to see that stuff.  It makes you feel tough.  There's stuff worse then that out there, and it's not actually stuff you want to see.

serialkillers,3cy37d,Luke2001,4,Thu Jul 16 02:32:29 2015 UTC,"I think what's worrisome is how excited people get about executing someone. Regardless of what someone may have done, it's still a life being taken away, and that should evoke some sort of feelings of sadness in people. Like, this criminal was once a child, an infant with an entire life ahead of him. At one point does it become ok as a society to celebrate someone's death? It's a very grey line and that's unsettling"
serialkillers,3cy37d,Luke2001,0,Sun Jul 12 02:08:26 2015 UTC,"Good points, but I would say that there is a very solemn process and as much dignity as possible for executions. There was a very good documentary about this which I have lost for the time being. True, there are people outside a prison who are yelling and carrying signs both for and against. I still remember that when Bundy was executed my teenager said, ""Don't you feel relieved that he is gone and no one has to worry about him anymore?"" So I understand relief and there is as much dignity as possible in the process; and there are other emotions like feeling vindicated etc. So I think very few actually ""celebrate.""  Also, there is SO little sympathy for the victims. they are just a picture, a face. Nobody gives much a thought to them beyond those who knew them."

I am one who believes in capital punishment, though. Because I've seen some of the most horrendous criminals receiving better treatment than our troops fighting for our protection. That's absolutely not cool with me. At the end of the day, we are human, most do fear death - but if they took no pity on their victims, I take no pity on them.

I don't condone it because ultimately everyone has a choice. You or I could have been born into fucking terrible circumstances and could have jump started a life of crime and killing just as much as the next guy. It is hard not to judge serial killers but the reality is that they are just as much as a human as we are. I am for capitol punishment in very rare cases, and serial killers are included in that."

I remember researching the then-unknown killer about two or three years before he returned with his infamous 2004 letter, and from what I can recall, the only truly detailed online source devoted to the unidentified Wichita Strangler was his entry in the Crime Library.  Amusingly enough, I devoted a page or so to him on the website I was keeping at the time, so, length-wise, my site had probably the second-largest online mention of the ""never-caught killer from Kansas"" after Crime Library, for a while.  (Side-note of minor curiosity: some time after he was caught and identified, I remember looking through old visitor logs to the page, and finding at least one hit from an ISP who serviced Kansas's Park City at the time. As far as I can recall, that visitor/those visitors viewed my page not too long after it went online, and quite some time before Rader resurfaced. Of course, it could have been anyone, but I remember wondering if it was Dennis Rader himself who had visited my website while he was still dormant... sniffing out any scarce online information about his true self, reminiscing and wishing that he had a larger Internet presence. I know that he certainly did read his entry on Crime Library a number of times long before writing the Wichita Eagle)."

It's not a celebration in my eyes, they've been turned into boogey men/monsters and in that way serve as a kind of warning. The impulse when something awful happens, is often to try and bury it/forget about it and I think that's a dangerous thing to do. Those that don't remember the past, are doomed to repeat it and all that.  On the flip side, there is a line. You can't deny that the intense media attention some murderers have received has been a factor in the minds of other killers. I'm not saying fame/infamy is ever the sole draw for killers, because I think that's incredibly simplistic and silly, but I can think of quite a few cases where killers personally alerted the media, ensured there was video evidence to get them attention etc.   Either way, action figures are harmless imo. There are much worse things in this kind of regard, like the people who collect letters from serial killers and treat them like prized posessions or the people who actually track down items that belonged to killers (and sometimes even vitcims) to collect."

serialkillers,3cmt2q,dethb0y,4,Thu Jul 9 08:56:18 2015 UTC,"He was originally institutionalised after injecting himself with rabbit blood, and blood seems to have always been a focus of his delusional behaviour - he continued to drink the blood of birds while he was hospitalised, and was apparently picked up with a bucket of cow's blood that he'd been smearing on himself/drinking in 1977. Chase was extremely unwell, and the peculiar nature of his delusions meant that without treatment he was a potential danger to other people.   In my opinion, the fact that he was released to his mother with no follow-up treatment plans is criminal. At the very least, the importance of keeping him on his medication should have been stressed to his mother. Without knowing why she took him off them (I suspect that the kind of drugs used in the 70s would have had some heavy side effects), I can't really comment on it, but I don't think anyone involved was evil.

serialkillers,3cmt2q,mws85,2,Thu Jul 9 17:53:28 2015 UTC,"he was diagnosed as mentally ill, but in a more general sense, from the murderpedia page:    When he had finished, he carved the corpse open and removed several of her internal organs, using a bucket to collect the blood and then taking it in the bathroom to bathe in it. He then sliced off her nipple and drank her blood, using an empty yogurt container as a drinking glass   That is not the behavior of anyone who's operating with a working brain. A sane person might kill another person, but they wouldn't engage in that kind of activity."
serialkillers,3cmt2q,dethb0y,2,Thu Jul 9 20:00:56 2015 UTC,You're making assumptions there I think. Now chase was definitely mentally ill but that was more obvious because of the things he used to do with the oranges and so on. A lot of serial killers engage in necrophilia which is a messed up thing but that doesn't make them mentally ill. They have a personality disorder of some kind  and sexual disorders but that isn't the same as mental illness. They know the difference between right and wrong when they're committing their acts.  That's why you see a lot of insanity pleas go nowhere because they're not insane.  Now they're obviously not normal either but again they're not mentally ill in most cases.
serialkillers,3cmt2q,mws85,3,Thu Jul 9 20:08:59 2015 UTC,"The CDC define mental illness as:    Mental illness is defined as “collectively all diagnosable mental disorders” or “health conditions that are characterized by alterations in thinking, mood, or behavior (or some combination thereof) associated with distress and/or impaired functioning.”   If some guy's fucking a corpse, that's a mental illness. Just because it's also a personality disorder (or whatever trendy bullshit the shrinks are saying now adays), does not mean it's not also a mental illness.  Also, the legal definition of insanity in terms of competency for trial is a totally separate issue from mental health. A person can be mentally healthy, but be found to have been out of control (due to a reaction to drugs, for example) at the time of a commission of a crime. It has more to do with how the person perceived the act they committed, rather than if they have a mental illness."

Does anyone else think the guards killed him, set it up to look like suicide..I doubt he was organized enough to save his meds to OD. Also, anyone ever seen any video of RC? Pictures, yes. Vids, nope."

serialkillers,3cmt2q,ConvertsToMetric,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:51:59 2015 UTC,"Random nitpick: I'm originally from Sac and it always confused me when they referred to Chase as operating in ""east Sacramento"" since what they really mean is the eastern part of Sacramento county, in Rancho Cordova/Carmichael (actual bedroom communities that butt up against Sac), not what locals refer to as East Sacramento (which is east of the capital by about 2 miles, but within the city itself, bound by the Sacramento River).   Nitpicking aside, Chase was seriously mentally ill. I'd save the ""evil"" title for killers like Bundy who were perfectly sane but gave zero shits about human life. I think Chase was barely functioning when he started killing, and was unable to determine the difference between his delusions and reality, let alone right and wrong. If you can manage to think of a murderer as helpless, I'd say that pretty much is Richard Chase."

serialkillers,3cjm6w,Ohmygag,3,Wed Jul 8 22:03:56 2015 UTC,I think the reason he was so efficient was cause he managed to make one of his victims an accomplice who lured girls with him. With another girl involved I'm guessing the victims didn't think twice about it. Though if he continued to act alone with his fake story I'm sure most of his victims wouldn't have bought it.   There's quite a few spree killing cases where the murderer gets attached with his forced accomplice and eventually lets her go. Bobby Joe Long comes to mind.

This woman was dealt a shitty hand from birth and I don't feel sympathy for many people mentioned in this sub, but heart aches for her.

serialkillers,3chryd,vieenvert,9,Wed Jul 8 13:12:12 2015 UTC,"Just re-watched Monster myself. I don't think she's a monster either. The first murder was definitely self-defense and she probably just snapped after that. She even spared the guy who was mentally handicapped and just wanted a HJ. Wonder how the story would have turned out if they were drug dealers instead of johns - ""drug deals gone bad""..."
serialkillers,3chryd,AnnyongFunke,4,Wed Jul 8 13:55:37 2015 UTC,"The movie is more fiction than fact, first she said it all started when one of her clients raped her, then she said that all of the murders were self defense.   Her girlfriend is also portrayed as innocent, and she was just as guilty because she didn't care about the murders as long as the money kept coming."
serialkillers,3chryd,NerdyJerzyGirl,3,Wed Jul 8 16:13:54 2015 UTC,"IDK, I think the movie emphasizes how the girlfriend ratted her out in the end. Her testimony and the recorded phone call were probably her ""get out of jail"" card for conspiracy."

serialkillers,3ccvg8,BundyBlues,16,Mon Jul 6 22:42:53 2015 UTC,"Super interesting interview, in my opinion. He talks at one point about ""who is to blame"" for his killings, or for making him the way he was, and takes full responsibility. Two other favorite moments- the first when he talks about when the police came to his door. How he just pointed to towards the bedroom when he was asked by police where the key to the handcuffs was. Also, when he says he didn't wear glasses during the trial so he didn't have to see anyone directly."
serialkillers,3ccvg8,Ghenges,6,Mon Jul 6 22:45:31 2015 UTC,I want to listen to this but I wished they weren't showing clips from that straight-to-DVD Dahmer movie over the audio.
serialkillers,3ccvg8,chhubbydumpling,3,Tue Jul 7 00:04:55 2015 UTC,dude that movie exposed me to Jeremy Renner for the first time in 2002 and I have loved him ever since. he is the only redeeming element of the movie.  so it has that going for it.
serialkillers,3ccvg8,georgiespies12,2,Tue Jul 7 01:50:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this movie made me question my worth as a human being... Renner was so sympathetic, I couldn't empathize with the victims properly.  I have to disagree with you on one point though... ""More, More, More,"" playing during the date-rape montage was one of the more memorable music moments in cinema to me.  I laugh every time.  Redemption +1."

serialkillers,3ccvg8,mws85,8,Tue Jul 7 00:43:28 2015 UTC,"this is one of the reasons why Dahmer is my favorite serial killer (which is kind of a fucked up thing to say, if you think about it).  he did awful, fucked up, actually some of the most fucked up stuff... but he, at least on the surface, recognizes his responsibility and doesn't hide from it.  he doesn't seem to hide or throw up barriers or try to skirt responsibility.  like, i almost get the sense that, if he could have avoided it (as in, if he weren't batshit), he wouldn't have killed and gone to the bizarre lengths that he did.  he's a sick, broken person.  but an actual person and not a pure predator like Bundy or that shitfuck BTK.  that said, he was a FUCKING MONSTER and being beaten in a prison bathroom is too good for him."
serialkillers,3ccvg8,a1ex1985,8,Tue Jul 7 04:23:17 2015 UTC,"It's funny you should say that. The more I think about it the more I wonder if hating serial killers is right. Don't get me wrong the crimes they commit are vile and they should be locked up for the rest of their lives, etc. The reason I say that is because when you really think about it- can they help the way they are? I mean they have control over their actions but can they help the fact they enjoy killing or get turned on by rape and all that kind of messed up shot or is it faulty wiring in their brains? Should they be locked up in hospitals for personality disorders versus prison I don't know.  Another example would be peadophiles- now there's very few crimes and so on more disturbing and uncomfortable for people than child molesters but again do they have any control over their sexual preferences? Now they damn right have control over whether they act on them and should be punished accordingly when they do but I can't think of many things worse than having those feelings. Seriously who the hell would choose given the choice to be sexually attracted to kids?! What's the upside to being a peadophile?! There is none!"
serialkillers,3ccvg8,mws85,6,Tue Jul 7 12:38:17 2015 UTC,"Pedophiles really can't control their sexual preferences, no one can, but what most people can control, is their actions. You choose to act on an urge.  Just like not every narcissistic psychopath or sociopath goes on a murder spree.  I think it has to be a mix of some sort of trauma/personality disorder/poor impulse control."
serialkillers,3ccvg8,mws85,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:47:23 2015 UTC,That's what I was saying :)
serialkillers,3ccvg8,resonanteye,3,Wed Jul 8 10:27:19 2015 UTC,"I tend to agree with you in a lot of ways. Dahmer was, in my opinion, the best example of this. Someone who committed some of the worst crimes imaginable - and yet (and I almost hate to admit it) I feel sympathy for him when he speaks. Maybe it's me being gullible or naive seeing as convincing people they were not the monsters they so clearly were was what they were best at, (see: Bundy, Kemper).   It still makes me incredibly sad to think about these people, though, faced with these urges and emotions that they obviously don't choose, or don't know how to explain to people around them. With some kind of psychological intervention, how much of it would have been suppressible? How much could have been avoided?"
serialkillers,3ccvg8,resonanteye,2,Tue Jul 7 16:04:47 2015 UTC,"There isn't a ton of support I'd imagine for people who are having these feelings. It's not like you can make an appointment with your GP/physician and just say ""hey doc I'm sexually attracted to children/I have violent fantasies"" .... well here you go such and such here's some pills. It doesn't work like that. I don't know if there is any country in the world where people gave somewhere to go for those kind of things where they can get support and so on bur maybe more money needs to be pumped into something like that. How much it would stop or limit those type of crimes but maybe it's worth trying at least."
serialkillers,3ccvg8,resonanteye,5,Tue Jul 7 16:31:02 2015 UTC,"Having violent fantasies or intrusive thoughts about harming others is something there is actually help for, though. It's something tons of people get help with- there's even an entire treatment for people with these thoughts. I don't think it would apply for pedophiles but for people with violent urges in general, yeah, shrinks hear that stuff all the time.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrusive_thought  edit to quote:    . Patients who are experiencing intense guilt, anxiety, shame, and upset over these thoughts are different from those who actually act on them. The history of violent crime is dominated by those who feel no guilt or remorse; the very fact that someone is tormented by intrusive thoughts and has never acted on them before is an excellent predictor that they will not act upon the thoughts.    If they seek help before they act, they can be helped.  Most who act on the thoughts can control them. They're not out of control- not mentally ill in the sense that it impedes on their judgement or decisions. Having these feelings and thoughts isn't too abnormal, being unable to cope with them or feeling compelled by them can be treated; but acting on them means that they're not unwelcome, and that you have something else going on (sociopathy, psychosis, psycopathy, no empathy, etc) that makes you culpable."
serialkillers,3ccvg8,mws85,5,Tue Jul 7 18:47:32 2015 UTC,"Awesome insight. I agree with you, and definitely didn't mean to make it sound like anyone who was mentally ill/experiencing these types of thoughts would be unable to be helped. But I think a lot of times it gets to a certain point where they themselves believe they can't be helped and therefore give in, or act on those thoughts. Also, mental health resources are far more prevalent than they were even ten years ago."
serialkillers,3ccvg8,resonanteye,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:40:08 2015 UTC,"Honestly I think a lot of these guys LIKE the thoughts, get wrapped up in them, and do not want to be ""helped"" to get rid of them.  I mean, they're enjoying it. They enjoy the fantasies and thoughts, and their lack of empathy means they don't see the thoughts or actions as bad, just as something they know they shouldn't get caught at. The only ""bad"" they see in these thoughts and behaviors is that they might get in trouble."
serialkillers,3ccvg8,whitneycat,2,Tue Jul 7 19:51:25 2015 UTC,"I think you're right in most cases. There may be the rarer person who does want help, but that may center slightly more on those that end up committing smaller, less hateful crimes? I'm not sure if I'm making my case very well here, finding it hard to articulate."
serialkillers,3ccvg8,morticiaaddarns,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:54:28 2015 UTC,"No, that makes sense. I do think that there are people who would want help, and yeah those are probably not the ones who commit the bigger or more aggressive crimes we read about. Or who repeat them. I have a feeling (could be wrong) that those would be the ones who make dumb mistakes and get caught fast- almost like they WANT to get caught.  Whereas the people who enjoy the violent thoughts, and don't want to get help, are the ones we're usually talking about in this sub.   I think that for the most part, if you're a serial killer, you're not hoping to stop. Or really thinking you need help. I think maybe in a rare case (Richard Chase might be a good example) some treatment and proper care could have stopped things; but for the most part these aren't people who are out of control. They take steps to hide the crimes, they know damn well that they are doing something everyone else considers evil or disgusting. They only care about not getting caught.  To the point: Chase thought he'd die if he didn't get blood. He was floridly psychotic by the time he started killing people, was diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic and had been taken off his meds by his mother when he started to get violent. He'd been committed several times and was unable to function at all on his own, really. Any doctor seeing him would probably have medicated and hospitalized him on sight.  He walked around after his crimes covered in blood in broad daylight, didn't try to get rid of evidence, was pretty well unaware that he should even try. He wanted to get caught so that he could get doctors to save him with blood transfusions, and was not happy that he had to kill to get his ""treatment"". That's madness right there.  Bundy was capable of functioning in society, betrayed few signs of being in any way violent in his day-to-day life, and understood the enormity of his acts. He did start young with his aggression and violence, but was not out of touch with reality at all during the time he was killing. If you'd taken him in for an assessment, he'd have insisted he was sane, and been able to prove it to any competent shrink.  He tried very hard to be normal in appearance, hid his crimes, and was so angry at being caught that he escaped and fought to the very end. He refused to talk about his necrophilia (the main motive for his crimes) and blamed everything and everyone around him for the things he had done."
serialkillers,3ccvg8,mws85,2,Tue Jul 7 20:15:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree with you there. Good example using Chase. Bottom line, these people will always exist within our society, and there will be unavoidable instances where these things will occur. And then people like us will debate their motives."
serialkillers,3ccvg8,sherribobbins,4,Tue Jul 7 20:33:51 2015 UTC,"I suffer with OCD and intrusive thoughts. That isn't the same as what serial killers, etc, have going on. An intrusive thought is a thought that comes into your mind pretty much unabated and kind of lingers there when you wish it would bugger off.   Most people who have intrusive thoughts don't want to act on them. Serial killers and psychopaths, etc, actually fantasise about violent scenarios. It's just not the same thing."
serialkillers,3ccvg8,whitneycat,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:26:44 2015 UTC,yeah exactly-  they aren't having thoughts they don't want. They're having thoughts they welcome and enjoy.
serialkillers,3ccvg8,antennafarm,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:37:15 2015 UTC,"Yup, agree. A lot of these guys revel in those fantasies, feed them with whatever sicko fiction/movies/porn they can find, and choose to act on them.  They're not fighting it, they're feeding it.    Dahmer even admits that he wouldn't have stopped, that he was ""dead set"" (hah) on continuing to feed his desire to kill."
serialkillers,3ccvg8,mws85,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:01:22 2015 UTC,"Exactly--while compulsions vary from case to case, in general they exist to alleviate the anxiety you are receiving from intrusive thoughts. That's what my therapist told me, anyways.   The obsession is something that disturbs you deeply--a highly religious person and very kinky sex, a new mother and obsessive thoughts of killing her child, etc. That's not really the case with homicidal/sadistic urges."
serialkillers,3ccvg8,MadeUpInOhio,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:57:08 2015 UTC,"While I understand where you're coming from - and if it were an ideal situation, sure - I just feel that it's a bit far fetched to expect someone suffering from this degree of mental illness to turn around and say ""Hey, I'm probably going to kill someone soon"" to a psychiatrist. Though looking at it from another view - that of the parents, may be beneficial. To be able to recognize your child is becoming withdrawn and showing signs of psychopathy at an earn age, and to combat it with some kind of treatment may be more plausible."
serialkillers,3ccvg8,resonanteye,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:38:52 2015 UTC,That's the thing though psychopathy in itself is not deemed a mental illness. It's a personality disorder for sure but they're still not seen in the same way that other mental illnesses are.
serialkillers,3ccvg8,resonanteye,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:42:42 2015 UTC,"Either way - it would still stand to reason that they would be, for the most part, unable to ask for help, yes? Totally get where you're coming from - just playing the Devil's advocate here. (irony)."
serialkillers,3ccvg8,whitneycat,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:47:00 2015 UTC,"As weird as it sounds I always felt a tinge of sadness for Dahmer. I know and realize he was  a very very horrific person, but he was lonely. He was coming to terms with being gay and had all these messed up fantasies about domination and killing but it boils down to that he was scared that his partner would leave him. I think a lot of people can empathize with the lonely aspect of Dahmer and that and his very sincere (at least seemingly) admission of being wrong and accepting he did horrible things, is what makes him one of the serial killers that many people can empathize with.  I remember having mixed emotions when it was announced he'd been killed in prison. Part of me actually felt semi sad and part of me felt kinda happy but I still think he should have lived his life undisturbed in prison as the court ordered.  I wish he'd gotten help prior to the killings from a professional but at the same time he's said himself that it wouldn't have changed anything and he reflects upon why he is the way he was. It makes him seem more like a depressed guy rather than a cannibal. It's a very conflicting situation. I wonder if he wasn't a sociopath/psychopath and had another type of mental disorder. Not wearing his glasses was a personal choice made by him in order to shield himself from guilt so it throws out psychopath/sociopathy as an answer. I wish he were alive so they could further study him and I'm curious as to what actual diagnosis would be made other than evil screw up."
serialkillers,3ccvg8,whitneycat,2,Thu Jul 16 19:55:47 2015 UTC,"I agree that there is most likely something to the idea that ""they can't help what they are.""  But the thing that stops me from going too far down that road is the fact that Dahmer didn't try to kill anyone in prison.  Neither did Gacy, despite the fact that they both preferred male victims.  Nor Dennis Nilson (Scotland's Jeffrey Dahmer).  Once they were locked up they managed to control their compulsions.  Dahmer admitted in this interview that he still has the urges, but he was able to restrain himself from acting on them once he was locked up.  So clearly it's possible for these guys to refrain from killing.  I realize it would be tougher to kill someone in prison, but the frequent prison violence we read about every day should tell you it's not impossible."
serialkillers,3ccvg8,imjkmd,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:58:16 2015 UTC,"hmm, interesting points.  i think, perhaps, it's better not to have a 'personal hate' (although i am sincerely annoyed at BTK due to his antics aside from killing), but a sort of 'social hate.'  serial killers and pedophiles are not healthy, functioning members of society... i don't mean 'functioning' like ""doing all the right things"" (the sort of thing that a college freshman would rail against), but literally, they're predators that wreck lives.  i think it's ok for society to 'hate' them, in a functional sense... even if they don't have any conscious control over their actions (say, charles whitman with his brain tumor), they're still dangerous.  a dog that is sweet 95% of the time but that last 5% is a rampaging beast... you put it down."
serialkillers,3ccvg8,antennafarm,2,Tue Jul 7 13:02:10 2015 UTC,Oh I totally understand it and definitely not justifying it. I guess I was just purely saying how much control do they have over thsee feelings and stuff do they have.
serialkillers,3ccvg8,resonanteye,2,Tue Jul 7 13:04:11 2015 UTC,"As someone with ocd, I have a lot of empathy for serial killers. Not sympathy, mind you. But I do know what it is like to have an urge or compulsion that you think you have to do. But, if people can learn to handle something like agoraphobia, he could have found a way to stop.   And, I do feel he is one of few compulsion killers to admit he had control."

Typically, a stag film had certain traits. Stag films were brief in duration (about 12 minutes or less), were silent, depicted explicit or graphic sexual behavior intended to appeal to heterosexual men, and were produced clandestinely due to censorship laws.

I know they're not really what one thinks of when they think, ""Serial killer"", but they've totally fascinated me since I heard their story. No, never watched that video, no, never going to, thanks for asking. I just think that it's amazing and horrifying that the three of them, all total psychopaths, found each other and helped each other commit these acts at such a young age. And with, it seems, no hesitation. I mean, how would you even bring that up with a friend of yours? ""Hey, want to go on a deadly rampage and horrify the nation/world for years to come? Like, on Tuesday or something?""   I think they differ a lot from school shooters because they weren't out for revenge, and they differ from solo child killers because they worked in a group. I'd probably have a lot to ask and get some horrible answers that I'd probably regret reading. What was their home life like? Did anyone suspect? Where did it begin (even before the animal torture, I mean)? Was one less sure than the others? I know one didn't get charged with the crimes because he technically did not participate. Was he the ""weaker"" of the group? Who lead? How well did they plan it? And mostly just to see how they differ from other people on the street.  It's just mind-boggling."

Morbid curiosity got the best of me with these videos, and I regret viewing them.    For some reason I'm drawing a blank on her killer's name, though.   Artyom Anufriev and Nikita Lytkin, the Academy Maniacs.    On April 5, 2011, two Russian youths, Artyom Anufriev (Russian: Артём Ануфриев) (born 1992) and Nikita Lytkin (Russian: Никита Лыткин) (born 1993), known as the Academy maniacs (Russian: Академовские маньяки) were arrested in connection with six murders and attacks on residents in Akademgorodok in Irkutsk. The attacks, which involved a mallet and knife, began in December 2010. Both were arrested after a video recording showing a female body being mutilated with a knife was found on a camera belonging to Litkin's uncle, who had become suspicious. According to media reports, the youths were influenced by reading about the Dnepropetrovsk maniacs on the Internet. A psychiatric examination found them sane, and they told doctors they chose weak people as their victims. On April 2, 2013, Anufriev was sentenced to life imprisonment, and Litkin to 24 years in prison.  I've dated someone I feel like could become America's next serial killer, and he seemed so normal til you got really close to him.   I would love to hear your thought about this. Why do you suspect he could do something like this? Do you have any interesting stories to share?

I've always wondered if people who are in the know about killers and their psyche have encountered people they recognize as being ""off"" in the same way, but when you delve into giving examples in the real world about how a guy you know could totally have people in his basement, I know it can get a little dangerous/sub rulebreaking-y.   I was with the guy on and off for years, from when we were 14/15 til he was 23ish. Hindsight is 20/20 and there are a lot of things that I think are indicative of a totally warped mind that I didn't notice back then or that I noticed but didn't know what to make of. Threats, language patterns, behavior, abuse cycles, and his past within his family. He's about 25 now and I watch the local news wondering if one day I'll see his face.

Anecdotally- I have a good friend who consistently tried to murder her baby brother as a child. Not like ""Haha, she doesn't like the baby"" but actual, premeditated attempts to kill him, multiple times, because she decided she didn't want a sibling. It got so bad that she was sent live with other family members and obviously had to get ""Please don't kill babies"" counseling. She didn't suffer a childhood of physical and sexual abuse like Bell did or learn violence from her family- she just decided one day the easiest way to not have deal with a sibling was dispose of it.  She grew up completely normal. She's horrified that she ever did this.   So while psychopathy and sadism in a child is a good indicator that it will carry into adulthood- it's not always a certainty, especially if it is recognised and receives treatment and attention, as was the case with Bell."

She never exhibited any other violent or sociopathic tendencies in any other aspect of her life or Callous/Unemotional Traits and never did anything else to try to hurt him and the two are now very close. It is a very weird, but apparently fairly common (to a lesser extreme) case. Which, yes, is extremely upsetting to think about."

serialkillers,3bsx00,torndress,-6,Tue Jul 14 01:19:13 2015 UTC,Sounds a bit paranoid.
serialkillers,3bsx00,mws85,7,Thu Jul 2 09:19:04 2015 UTC,"That was my entire point, it does make you paranoid. Someone asked for personal experience and I shared MY personal experience. Why such a lousy comment? :/"
serialkillers,3bsx00,torndress,-4,Tue Jul 7 23:10:43 2015 UTC,"""you have no idea when you may say something years later that pisses them off and all of a sudden something tragic happens. there are always crazies on the outside who can be just as manipulated into doing something awful.

Let's be honest, what's the number of people that have been murdered or had their family members murdered as a result of writing to one of these people? I'm going to bet very few if any."
serialkillers,3bsx00,mws85,3,Tue Jul 7 23:22:24 2015 UTC,"Why is this silly? I’ve had it happen to me, and I’ve seen it happen to colleagues or people I’ve worked with in the past. Why did you all of a sudden jump to murder? What about harassment or threatening mail? That wasn’t what I was trying to get across at all, ""murder,"" murdering people left and right. Why jump to that conclusion? I'm not sure I understand your logic at all, mate."
serialkillers,3bsx00,torndress,-2,Wed Jul 8 01:22:18 2015 UTC,"Well the ""god forbid you mentioned your kids or spouse. Trust me"" was rather melodramatic to be fair."
serialkillers,3bsx00,mws85,3,Wed Jul 8 10:29:09 2015 UTC,"I disagree. I work for a psychiatrist and she is very adamant about not letting any of our patients even know that she has a son, let alone sharing his name. Anyone having contact with dangerous people of any kind should always be wary of what they say."
serialkillers,3bsx00,asmorris,2,Thu Jul 9 04:30:34 2015 UTC,"Well according to these clowns, we are all just melodramatic lunatics who have no idea what we’re talking about. (Trolls). It’s almost laughable, but still frustrating in the same sense. Your doctor is correct, and this is instructed “security,” SOP, it’s important for a reason. We didn’t just make up a rule for no grounded reason. Second, what an ignorant thing to say, a psych is paranoid. So I was paranoid for no reason? Hate to type this, but, “lol.” These other comments are not only flawed, but ignorant."
serialkillers,3bsx00,torndress,-3,Tue Jul 14 01:37:08 2015 UTC,The psychiatrist is also probably a little paranoid aswell. Anyway that's a different thing because she has direct contact with her patients and thus there's a possibility they could follow her home or whatever if they really wanted to.
serialkillers,3bsx00,mws85,2,Thu Jul 9 10:56:57 2015 UTC,"Okay soooo it's MORE logical for a person to follow someone home from prison than it is to write threatening mail? :shakes head: okay, buddy."
serialkillers,3bsx00,torndress,3,Tue Jul 14 01:40:39 2015 UTC,"I didn’t see it as melodrama, but rather pragmatism. Because if you ever mention personal information or anything about family, you're opening yourself up to vulnerability. That’s a fact, I don’t care if you tell your neighbor or a con. And if you had worked in that environment for prolonged periods of time, you’d understand how that sh*t works. People buy and sell mail all the time, so who the hell knows who is actually getting what mail. Honestly, I can’t for the life of me understand why me warning others against “bad idea jeans” has caught so much criticism."
serialkillers,3bsx00,torndress,-1,Tue Jul 14 01:15:02 2015 UTC,Because serial killer cons aren getting at any time soon that's why it's silly!

They'll use you for what they can get out of you, and they can be incredibly dangerous even behind bars.  I'd second the point about NEVER giving out any personal information, even vague clues about who you really are.  And no pictures, for God's sake.  Be careful!"

serialkillers,3bonmh,BrianW1999,10,Wed Jul 1 04:09:29 2015 UTC,It's pretty legitimately difficult to find someone actually worse than Corll. He's almost in a class of his own.
serialkillers,3bonmh,dethb0y,4,Wed Jul 1 05:32:57 2015 UTC,The toy box killer has to be worse but otherwise Randy Kraft is probably his equal. Never understood why Bundy and Gacy were more well known.
serialkillers,3bonmh,Superdudeo,4,Wed Jul 1 19:29:12 2015 UTC,"How? Gacy copied him exactly; with the “handcuff trick,” young accomplices, forced victims to write home expressing they had a new job, and used the exact torture board technique. Randy Kraft and William Bonin tortured, raped, and killed young boys. Westley A Dodd raped and murdered children (after kidnapping and one or two held hostage), Albert Fish did the same and then ate them. Corll’s a despicable human being but let’s be real here. All serial murderers are hard to classify because they all fall into some depraved category that’s difficult to swallow. One killer isn’t worse or better than another: they’re all equal scumbags and all of their victims suffered horrible deaths. That’s like saying one SK’s victims had it better than another."
serialkillers,3bonmh,torndress,3,Thu Jul 2 00:18:02 2015 UTC,"That's exactly what were saying here though. Would you rather die to months of torture and a spiked dildo shoved in your anus or a single gunshot to the head?  I also find it very odd how you state all killers are equal scumbags, but then go to quickly defend Wayne Henley and admit to liking him alot.  So, you're basically admitting one killer IS better than another in subsequent posts in the same thread.  O.o"
serialkillers,3bonmh,McSkeezah,2,Tue Jul 7 17:04:31 2015 UTC,"Actually what I was commenting on was, “It's pretty legitimately difficult to find someone actually worse than Corll…” Worse in what aspect, victim or method or murder? There were many who did exactly what he did so I was offering info on others who may be worse than Corll. Not looking for a consensus here, just offering some different information, geez. Wasn’t even trying to pick a fight. I respect this message board/subreddit enough to read what everyone has to say, think about it, and give some info. Guess I wasn’t sure how to work a message board! Not clear on your detail on “months of torture” either, because Corll didn’t torture people for months or weeks. Lake and Ng did however, is that worse? Being a sex slave tied to a bed in a dark hole in the ground and tortured with god knows what? Oh and they killed someone’s baby and let her know about it too. :shrug: And which serial killer quickly shot their victim in the head?? Are you confusing this with mass murderers, because that’s an entirely different arena. You find it odd that I state all killers are scumbags? Hmm, wasn’t quite sure I was clear on that. I wouldn’t say defense is an accurate term in regards to Henley either, but keep in mind you’re comparing apples and oranges. Corll was the engineer. I’ll be more than happy to extrapolate off the board, but I thought my honest feelings on him in the present didn’t reflect what happened in the 70s.  O.o"
serialkillers,3bonmh,torndress,9,Tue Jul 7 23:26:26 2015 UTC,"Might have had to do with the fact that he was gay, and being gay was obviously not a popular thing in 1970s Texas."
serialkillers,3bonmh,FAST_AND_GREAT,6,Wed Jul 1 06:57:51 2015 UTC,"From what i gather, a few things contribute to his lack of notoriety:   He happened before serial killers were a big media phenomenon People in the area have largely just tried to forget him"
serialkillers,3bonmh,dethb0y,5,Wed Jul 1 05:33:34 2015 UTC,"Gacy also learned all of his ""tricks"" from Corll and Henley. I think the only reason why Corll wasn't in the media that much was because Henley blew him away Aug. 8."
serialkillers,3bonmh,torndress,5,Wed Jul 1 05:50:56 2015 UTC,"Definitely possible; Gacy dominated the news for a long time. His dying before being caught helped keep him out of the spotlight (though the trials of his accomplices were big news at the time, i gather)."

I actually live about 4 miles from his house in the Heights. Speak to his mom every so often, get his crafts and cards, etc. We’ve developed a pretty good rapport after about 3 years. I like the dude, a lot. I’ve heard intimate, lesser known things about Dean, David, and Wayne himself, about their family, relationships, drugs, etc. The entire story is One. Bizarre. Twist. after another. It's way more interesting than anything you'll read on the internet. Plus, you can't always take things you read at face value. Facts are facts, opinions are another. And don't misread this reply as an open bleeding heart for criminals, all I'm saying is there's way more to the story. What he did, he accepts and acknowledges.

serialkillers,3bphpb,LynnTheCat,5,Wed Jul 1 02:42:52 2015 UTC,I could see that being plausible. Maybe one reaches out to the dark net market for a rush instead of killing someone.

serialkillers,3bphpb,Trollohunter,6,Wed Jul 1 05:59:05 2015 UTC,"I think content on the internet might prompt people with a certain disposition to want emulate what they see. I think once you get to the point of genuinely wanting to kill people, you're past that stage of getting a fantasy fix on the internet and you want the real thing.

All those geotagged photos and Foursquare check-ins mean someone knows where you are. Serial killers often prey on drifters because no one knows where to look for them when they go missing."
serialkillers,3bme4l,masiakasaurus,74,Tue Jun 30 11:44:13 2015 UTC,"More of a spree killer, but Elliot Rodger was deeply pathetic. Mad at dudes for getting sex, mad at women for not giving him sex, but he never considered getting mad at his own creepy self.   I can't believe some people online actually took his side. He was ridiculous."
serialkillers,3bme4l,LittleSpits,23,Tue Jun 30 14:29:04 2015 UTC,I think the thing that strikes me as most pathetic with these killers is when they have this smugness and superiority about them that's just not reflected by their actual achievements in life. Elliot Rodgers is definitely an example of that.
serialkillers,3bme4l,Layil,14,Tue Jun 30 17:24:34 2015 UTC,"I read his manifesto.  His massive ego was out of tune with reality.  He was a pathetic guy, for sure.  He could never get the world to agree with what he thought he deserved.  Half of the writing was his lamenting that he couldn't manage to win the lottery, which he felt was the one thing holding him back."
serialkillers,3bme4l,wharrislv,17,Tue Jun 30 18:24:45 2015 UTC,Reading his manifesto was an odd experience. It was so super obvious why he was having the problems he was having but he was so narcissistic that he was blind to how glaringly illogical his whole book and world view was. Like he didn't once take into account how he would come across from a purely objective point of view to the reader. I wanted to punch him in the face throughout the whole thing.
serialkillers,3bme4l,Kawaii_Fart_Tits,13,Tue Jun 30 19:33:45 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I expected to feel some kind of sympathy, but I didn't at all.  He expected the world and didn't put any effort into anything.  The most he was willing to do was beg or hope for material goods.  I understand the sentiment that things are easier with money, but this kid was completely delusional with respect to what it can actually do for you.  His friends accounts of what he was like were pretty haunting.  Very quiet, unable to keep conversation, etc.  It is mirrored perfectly in his writing where his entire way of looking for companionship was to go get a coffee and sit and wait outside for someone to come up to him and recognize his greatness.  Bizarre behavior for sure, I'm surprised that no one told him he was acting weird."
serialkillers,3bme4l,wharrislv,6,Tue Jun 30 20:01:53 2015 UTC,"I thought he did a good job of capturing the innocence and happiness of childhood.  Even though kids can be cruel, a lot more is tolerated in terms of out of the norm behaviors.  Everyone is kind of socially awkward at that age anyway, and kids can get away with being weird or obsessive without being totally ostracized.  I did feel some sympathy due to his awareness of how everyone else around him was changing and growing up and he was stuck in place."

serialkillers,3bme4l,wharrislv,10,Wed Jul 1 02:49:29 2015 UTC,"Eliot Rodger gave me deja vu. An old high school/college friend of mine said VERY similar things about women. Unlike Eliot my friends problem was he was 350+ pounds and flat refused to eat less and work out. He thought he just deserved smoking hot blonde girls showing up at his house to fuck him. Even though he was morbidly obese, he thought fat chicks were beneath him.  Haven't spoken to him in years but man was it weird reading that."
serialkillers,3bme4l,svperstarr,3,Wed Jul 1 05:28:30 2015 UTC,"I knew a guy like this. I'm kinda good looking and this guy was into me but I wasn't into him.

He was not attractive at all, had nothing to show for, no ambitions or motivation except smoke weed all day, go to his dead end job and play games all night. But he thought he deserved a hot, perfect girl that was a virgin and had to bare him many children, she had to stay at home for him and he didn't deserve any less than that. He tried to even control me despite knowing we were only friends and I did not ""qualify"" for half his demandq anyway. Guy is insane, wouldn't be shocked if he ended up being a rapist or something. So entitled... And he wondered why no girl wanted him! He said he looked like an actor too, and after removing him he stalked me for months. And never did he wonder if maybe he was the problem..."

serialkillers,3bme4l,svperstarr,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:31:09 2015 UTC,"I posted a message on a forum for an xbox game because I wanted to play with other people instead of by myself. This guy adds me, finds out I'm female and turns out to live close by. I'm not a very social person and don't make friends easy so I allowed him to add me on fb and we had a really cool time at first even though I immediately said I was not interested in anything other than friendship (very clearly!). Which was okay at first. But then he got jealous, checked what I did and when, which is when I removed him and he sent me tons of I'm sorry messages and my mum said he's just in love with you, you need to be more forgiving and be clear with him. So I decided to be nice and we started talking again. He was completely normal and so I re-added him a few months later. And then it started again. Stalking my FB, literally demanding I speak to him on FB, insulting me etc. I decided to ignore him and try and make him lose interest cause I wouldn't game with him anymore. Keep in mind he turned out to say some rather vile and creepy things (among what I already mentioned previously) and he knew where I lived/went to school etc. But ignoring him didn't work, being rude didn't work either and actually trying to talk to him made him twist my words in every possible way and he always blamed everything on everyone else but himself because he was a victim of my inconsiderate manners. Basically he is a really big narcissist. When I removed him the second time he basically sent my younger brother a message saying I did sexual things to him and he told my xbox friends similar things. I never touched him. I paid for my own drinks, my own things because I refused to be in debt to him in any way (and I have a big thing against gifts it makes me very uncomfortable). He stalked me on xbox for months, joining every single one of my game sessions (which meant he had to search server after server to even find me). I also believe he's driven past my house a couple of times. I basically believe that he'll make the news here one day for being rejected yet again by a girl and either raping or murdering her because of it. He's really someone in need of mental help. I am glad he's stopped attempts of contacting me when he heard I went to the police about him. It's been months now but if I see him again on the street I will walk away. And fast."

All of Nilsen's victims were killed for the same reason Dahmer killed Hicks when he was 18 years old... because he didn't want them to leave. Dahmer killed Hicks with blunt force and Nilsen killed by strangulation, but the motives were the same. Dahmer's grew away from that and became much more like Berdella, attempting to create permanent zombies for sex slaves. Nilsen stagnated and never moved beyond that original impulse."

Even if you look at the bomb as a distraction to buy him time at Utøya, it was unfortunately an easy target. It's an island, difficult to access and even when the police could get there, it takes a while to get armed cops there as we don't have them as standard. There was also a lot of screw ups on the police's part that threw away a lot of time (don't remember the details of this, but there was a very scathing inquiry after the fact).  He claimed that his aim for the end was originally suicide by cop (failed that), and during the trial he was claiming he wanted the law to change so he would be executed. Now he's sitting in a jail cell, whining that the pen they gave him is ""a form of torture"" and evidence that our jail system is ""sadistic"" because it's ""ergonomically deformed"".

Imagine a life where you're so estranged from the world (chicken before the egg) that either you feel compelled to murder or you murder because of some other irrepressible compulsion and are abhorred for it. They get some satisfaction from killing by feeling like they're powerful and maybe they get sexual satisfaction from it, but either way they bank on the revulsion that the rest of us feel by their actions. They take our fear to mean that they are in control, they are powerful, they are important. In reality, they're the bottom of the barrel. Anyone can kill - it's not hard. None of us want to, however. They do it because of the begrudging respect they get from our fear of them. Because they can't get respect as people by going with the grain like the rest of us, they opt for the opposite extreme.   Whatever the reason they kill, they're worthless leeches on society that only survive after they are caught because we are civilized and have laws preventing their immediate murder. The only people not completely disgusted by them are people (like us, I suppose) that are morbidly fascinated by them and want to learn more about them so they can protect against them, or other serial killers. No one cares if they live or die and 99.999% of people are hoping they'd die as soon as possible. There's nothing whatsoever that even resembles a normal human life within an serial killer - they're all complete failures of people.

She didn't poison, which is traditionally a woman's tool. She wasn't attractive. She was a lesbian, which made a lot of people think that was what made her a serial killer based on male patterns. She wasn't an angel of mercy, another category skewed towards female offenders.   Yes, these are gross overgeneralizations but I'm not writing an essay. She was typical of female killers in that she did so mainly for monetary gain. I think the first murder probably was self defense, but I think she realized it was quick cash and she started to enjoy it. She was profoundly mentally disturbed (I don't think she was a typical socio- or psychopath), her horrific childhood certainly set the stage for what she turned into."

So she was sort of taking it out on them while simultaneously robbing them to support herself. Kind of different, but not necessarily unique in my opinion."

Yet I also agree with him that some of her graphic testimony wasn't just made up out of her head. I think it might not have happened to any of the johns she killed, but I have no doubt she suffered some of that abuse at some point to be able to describe it like that."

serialkillers,3bcyo9,samanthahazard,19,Sun Jun 28 01:16:10 2015 UTC,I wonder why he was moved to the mother of all super maxes.  I have never thought of Ridgeway as a person who would make a violent prisoner. I know that sounds funny since he is a serial killer but he killed females and I don't remember reading about him being violent outside of his murders.   Washington State is not a country club but the one in Colorado is supposed be pretty extreme.   Maybe there was a threat against him?  I hope they do follow this up with more information even if it is that they were just making room at Washington.

serialkillers,3b9zmp,SherlockLady,10,Sat Jun 27 05:09:15 2015 UTC,"From the link provided in comments:  ""Lolita Davis, alleged her husband, had been perfectly happy until she had come into the possession of a particular book, “Blind Devotion, I think it was called,” he said. The book was about a woman in Michigan who had four children and at some point, he said, his wife had come into the notion that the book had been written about her.  “Her mind was tortured,” he conceded, “She was acting peculiar for weeks.” At first, he said, that he thought the strange ideas were occurring because of her anemia.  It was two weeks ago that he woke to find his wife sitting upright in bed having a cigarette. When questioned, “She said that she had a terrible confession. She knew the spirits were going to kill me and turn the children over to white slavers. An evil spirit was creeping up on us and she was waiting for it.“  Realizing that there was something imminently wrong with his wife he immediately took her to a psychiatrist. The doctor and Mrs. Davis visited for a considerable length of time and when both Davises left Lolita remarked that she had felt “as though a terrific burden had been lifted.” However soon after the consultation she, again, began discussing the book and stating that she had seen visions of demons torturing the children. Refusing to seek council with another psychiatrist, Lolita Davis instead agreed to be seen by physicians. It was then that she was diagnosed as being anemic and had been receiving shots for the condition. “I took her to two doctors and to a psychiatrist,” stated her husband, “The psychiatrist told me that there was nothing wrong with her that couldn’t be cured.”  Dr. V. J. Stack, the family physician came forward and confirmed that Barton Davis himself had contacted the doctor not more than two weeks prior because he feared that his wife was teetering on the brink of insanity.""

serialkillers,3b702q,phantomprincecopy,15,Sun Jul 5 22:51:39 2015 UTC,"Leaving a body to be found.  Knowing the victim, or having a known motive against the victim.   Living a lifestyle where the killer would stand out (isolated, mean, no connections or social life).   Eyewitnesses, camera footage, slipping up with their story, footprints, tire tracks, credit card purchases, missed time at work on the day of disappearance or a general lack of strong alibi. The type of weapon can be traced, certain type of gun based on casing or bullet or powder, knife size and features, rope or tape material and size. Unexplained injuries on the killer that happen during a struggle. Hair, DNA, prints, or clothing fibers from the victim found on the killer (in killers home, clothes, car, etc)."
serialkillers,3b702q,phantomprincecopy,4,Fri Jun 26 16:03:35 2015 UTC,"Having the body be found is the big one.  Without a body there is always doubt.. i.e. Did the person just want to leave their old life behind and restart it?  Here are some examples:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Springfield_Three https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disappearance_of_Maura_Murray https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jodi_Huisentruit  In all of those you have a place where they probably disappeared from.  But nothing solid pointing in any direction.  Given the time frame most people would say they are all dead.. However this is always that doubt.. Are they being held in some guys basement? Sold into sex trafficking? Brainwashed into a cult?  Once you have a body you know they are dead.. You know where the body was dumped.. You likely know how they died.  You might have a good time frame, etc.  A body doesn't guarantee you will find your killer.. Look at the Long Island Serial killer case.. plenty of bodies but no real clue.. But now they know they have a serial killer.  Before they just had some missing prostitutes.. No one was taking that seriously.  The ""perfect"" crime is where no one knows the person is missing.  If no one is looking then there is a very low chance of being caught.  Once a body is found they will be looking.  Even if they don't know anything other than they have remains.  Once they start looking any mistakes that are made can lead them to the killer.  Sometimes the mistakes still aren't enough.. The police can have a pretty good idea of who did it.. But they don't have enough to prove it in court."
serialkillers,3b702q,arickp,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:55:47 2015 UTC,"What specific DNA? How does leaving a body incriminate a serial killer? Also, if it's so easy to catch them with this evidence, why do so many get away? Also, is it possible to get prints when the killer wears certain gloves?"
serialkillers,3b702q,phantomprincecopy,4,Fri Jun 26 16:17:47 2015 UTC,"DNA from any source - saliva, semen, blood, any body fluid really, or body part.  Leaving a body means someone was murdered, so the investigators will be hunting. Having no body makes the job much harder on investigators. They have to prove a murder happened and that the person didn't just run away.  If an investigator had all that evidence, it would be easy, but it's become pretty common knowledge via an abundance of information of how to cover your tracks.  It's also worth noting that committing multiple crimes in a small area where the killer lives will narrow the focus on the killers location.   Gloves should cover any prints. Keeping said gloves would be a mistake, though, as other evidence may be on them (victims DNA)."
serialkillers,3b702q,phantomprincecopy,2,Fri Jun 26 17:55:23 2015 UTC,"Just wondering, how would a killer avoid CCTV evidence if he/she is active in a city/urban area? Also, can forensics link you to DNA if they don’t previously have you on criminal record, and if so, how? Do you need more evidence than a singular piece of DNA evidence to convict somebody? I often here it said that killers are much less likely to caught if they do not make their intentions known or communicate with the police. How would communicating with the police lead to capture, specifically by letter?"
serialkillers,3b702q,alwaysahunned,2,Fri Jun 26 18:24:26 2015 UTC,"They could avoid it by being in an area where they are unknown along with a disguise of sorts (hats, sunglasses, clothing style they don't wear day to day, wearing clothes under clothes so they can change and be seen as in 2 different places at once). Planning out ahead of time would be best, though. Know where the cameras will be and then avoid them.  You can only be linked via DNA if your DNA is on record. But if you become a suspect, you can be forced to give your DNA. That's why it's most important to not have a body to turn into a murder investigation.  Yes, keeping intentions hidden is best. It's a game of attention. The more attention the killer draws to himself (by evidence, arrogance, bizarre behavior, etc) the greater his chance of being noticed and linked to the crime.  A letter can be traced via DNA on stamps and the seal. If saliva isn't used, then whatever is used to activate the adhesive can still be traced. Not easily to a person, but to a product or water source, potentially. The paper and envelope can also be traced fairly easily. The manufacturer and a serial number are, on most paper, invisibly printed. These can point to exactly what store a paper or envelope was purchased. Handwriting can be matched, and ink (type/mix, and depression/wear patterns) can be traced to a printer. Obviously, electronic mail is much easier to trace.  I should've mentioned earlier trophies. Another great way to be caught.  If a killer wants to remain free, they need to leave no body, contain and destroy all evidence (including the body), not operate near their living area, abduct, kill and dispose in all separate locations, and be an outwardly normal appearing person. Again, it's a game of attention. The less on them, the better."
serialkillers,3b702q,phantomprincecopy,3,Fri Jun 26 19:32:21 2015 UTC,"Another thing about DNA -- it doesn't necessarily have to be obtained by giving a sample at the police station. With BTK, once they had a hunch after a floppy disk traced back to him through the metadata in Word, they subpenaed his daughter's pap smear test to get a match with DNA from one of his crime scenes.  Your DNA is out there, more or less."
serialkillers,3b702q,CanadianSavage,1 point,Mon Jun 29 08:55:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your answers. I always heard that the best serial killers were those nobody knew were active. Those who play cat and mouse with the police are usually caught much faster (at least in modern day).   Just for curiosity, what's the best way a killer can communicate with the police (as the killer) with the least chance of getting caught?"
serialkillers,3b702q,David_P_Ray_TorC_NM,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:15:24 2015 UTC,"I'll have to think about that.   Edit: I can't think of any good, safe way that ensures no capture. Best I can think of is steal paper and pen from somewhere far away, write intentionally bad or with wrong hand, or go hard and make your own letters and stamp them in ink. Leave the letter somewhere with the envelope labeled for the Police, don't mail it. There's really no good way, it's a risk since it's giving something to focus on and gives the investigators a means to get in the killers head and via media communication push him to make a mistake. Ultimately, if you're writing a story, you can do whatever, really."

serialkillers,3b702q,phantomprincecopy,2,Fri Jun 26 22:55:20 2015 UTC,"You could, but it's just one more thing to be traced. They can find out where it was sent from, then look for cameras, etc.  You could do it via the victims cell phone, I suppose. Just get out of the area asap."

Then his mom married Johnny Culpepper Bundy and moved Ted to Washington. I wanna say that by the age of ten, he had had three different names and three different houses in three different states. When he got older and discovered his sister was really his mother... I think that's when he broke completely.   He never knew who he was. He never knew who anyone around him was. Women had lied to him his entire life. Then he met the girl, Stephanie, he became enamoured with. Her rejection of him is was cemented his becoming.   I feel like his childhood and the lies everyone told formed him and then the rejection and realization of those lies enraged him so profoundly."

serialkillers,3b5ea8,FAST_AND_GREAT,3,Sat Jun 27 01:23:26 2015 UTC,I always assumed he was a sexual sadist or someone who got pleasure from killing/mutilating victims.  That seems to be a major recurring theme with serial killers.  Gay ones kill boys/men and straight ones kill girls/women.
serialkillers,3b5ea8,Liz-B-Anne,7,Mon Jul 6 08:14:46 2015 UTC,"I think that Bundy just wanted a sexual partner that he was in total control of.  He had learned the hard way that even if he got a girlfriend she was an individual who wouldn't always submit to his will.  By kidnapping and killing his victims Bundy had ""sexual partners"" that would never reject him and to whom he could do whatever he wanted.  The fact that he was a necrophile meant that he could possess them as a sexual object well past the time they died.    The violent pornography you referenced was mainly 60s and 70s pulp detective and porno magazines which depicted rape and torture in lurid detail.  I believe Bundy when he said that he was influenced by this pornography but I wouldn't blame the porn for who he became.  I think he was a psychopath who latched on to the images and stories in those magazines and built his fantasy around the idea of being in total control of a woman."

serialkillers,3b5ea8,Low_Man_n_Yella_Coat,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:03:34 2015 UTC,"I think of it as a combination of factors. Failing to bond properly with his family early in life left him with little or no capacity for empathy. Exposure to violent pornography at a young age put the wrong kind of ideas in his head. Drinking heavily while in college, coupled with depression over the end of his relationship with his first serious girlfriend and various academic and financial pressures, led to him roaming around at night and perhaps trying to carry out a few impulsive, probably failed early attacks.   I think the period where he wined and dined his ex, proposed to her, and then left her at the figurative altar was a pivotal time. I don't think he necessarily intended to seduce her and then break her heart for revenge, as is commonly thought. Rather, I think his seduction of her was all built on a mountain of lies... lies about his job, his station in life, borrowing friends' cars and apartments in order to show her around town, etc. I think once he got home he realized that he'd never be able to keep all that up forever, and I think that may be the point where he decided to give up on being Joe Normal and marrying the prom queen and threw himself wholeheartedly into his murderous hobby."

serialkillers,3b2muh,returningvideotapess,6,Thu Jun 25 22:24:31 2015 UTC,"This is the most information I've ever been able to find:   Stanley Burden reported that Daniel Conahan offered to pay him $100 to $150 to pose for nude bondage photographs. Burden agreed and Conahan drove the two of them to a wooded location. After taking several pictures, Conahan pulled out a rope and tied Burden to a tree.  While restrained, Conahan performed oral sex on Burden and attempted to have anal sex with him.  Burden resisted by positioning his back side up against the tree. Conahan placed the rope around Burden's neck and unsuccessfully tried to strangle him for half an hour. Conahan finally gave up.  Burden freed himself and reported the incident to the police. The police located the crime scene and found a tree with markings that corroborated Burden's injuries and story.   Source."

She knows a few of the girls and knows family of almost all of them who are missing. They've been speaking to whoever they can, local news outlets, sharing missing posters etc telling everyone that they know its a serial killer and the local police weren't doing anything about it because of the women's background. From what she told me it seems like they don't want that kind of stigma and bad press.  Edit: Everyone commenting is making valid points. I should have been clearer and said it's not so much that they refused to say it's possibly a serial killer. More so their refusal to investigate even as missing persons."
serialkillers,3ayt3w,giaryka,18,Wed Jun 24 17:56:41 2015 UTC,"No major city, much less a smaller town wants to admit they have an active serial killer on the loose.   It invites a media storm and puts the police force under a microscope.

serialkillers,3ayt3w,Kimchidiary,7,Thu Jun 25 07:03:34 2015 UTC,"The media love a serial killer case because of their rarity. Even rarer is a case where a killer involves himself with the investigation, and that hasn’t happened for quite some time, so they'll be hungry for almost anything that could be portrayed as the presence of an active serial killer. Media input can disrupt investigations also, as it gives the killer insight into the investigation. They also somewhat put certain blame on the victims if they are sex workers/drug users. It can be a real strain. However, it can also be a great source of insight and helps seep out any information people might be holding that leads to an arrest. It goes both ways, depending of the coverage."

serialkillers,3ayt3w,Aloysius_Jentee,6,Thu Jun 25 04:18:24 2015 UTC,I think the victim MO is pretty consistent but what we don't have of the article that would nail it down is how the condition of the bodies (were they all wrapped in sheets or cloth) and how they died. If they all died except the one who was shot died from a drug OD then the killer is luring them away from people with promises of sex and or drugs and them making them OD and watching as they die.

I don't approve of the things DPR said or did but I appreciate the book. I think the story needs to be told and I have an appreciation for Jim's story telling. He's a great story teller. It's a shame it had to shine through on something like this. The opening prologue is one of the most disturbing things I've ever read,  but it's well put together. It's worse than this transcript above because it describes one of the videos found.  I believe his wife left him after the book came out and something was said like: only a psychopath could write something like that. Jim obviously wasn't a psychopath, he was obsessed with the case, consumed by it, and the book could only be written by someone who deeply cared about the story. He doesn't care about DPR, he cares about the victims and the book is more for the victims than anything else. I wouldn't know how to show the public this is important without disturbing them a little. If everyone read just the prologue they'd realize there are problems with the justice system that need to be talked about and changed. But that topic never works. And people would be too busy being offended by the content. But being offended doesn't change the fact it happened."

I just posted it because there was another post and a debate about the authenticity of the translation. But here is the Prologue for a sample: [the first part is a quote of the search warrant..so, uh, not his writing.]  ""The black mask in the storage shed appears from the description given to be the mask or similar mask which (David) Ray has been observed wearing in video tapes which were seized from his residence and which were viewed by officers pursuant to previous search warrants."" Police search warrant, 4/13/1999   Smoke was pouring out from between her legs, the sacred place where God had intended for this young woman to give birth to a baby someday. Eight Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) special agents watched the homemade videotape with a growing sense of horror crossing their somber faces. Their eyes followed the two people torturing the faceless victim— David Parker Ray, fifty- nine, and his girlfriend, Cynthia Lea Hendy, thirty- nine. The criminals hovered over the naked woman and stuck a hot cattle prod inside her vagina, watching her body writhe in pain. The agents kept their eyes on Ray and Hendy. The federal investigators were sitting inside an eight- by twenty- five- foot white cargo trailer where the crime had taken place. The trailer was parked on the edge of Bass Road, along the shoreline of the largest lake in New Mexico— Elephant Butte Lake. The partners in crime lived on the outskirts of a small town cradled in the high, dry desert country of southern New Mexico— a strange place called Truth or Consequences. The cops couldn’t take their eyes off the torture unfolding in front of them. The naked woman, spreadeagled on her back, was anchored to a black leather medical table by the red nylon straps on her wrists and her ankles. Her eyes and mouth were covered with silver duct tape. She could barely move. David Ray was wearing a long black robe and his face was covered by a black leather mask sprinkled with gold glitter. He looked out through two large eyeholes. He laughed as he rammed the cattle prod inside the terrified woman. Cindy Hendy was waving a small handgun, threatening to kill the woman if she didn’t let the couple have their way with her. Patty Rust and her fellow FBI agents watched the dying girl struggle to get free. It was clear to all of them that she’d been drugged out of her mind and frightened into submission by her dominating captors. The duo took off the duct tape and she screamed for help as the car mechanic and his welfare- cheating girlfriend continued to make her beg for her life. The two sadists continued to molest the young woman until blood oozed out of her mouth and her ears. A moment later, her head slumped to the side and her body went limp. The FBI agents turned off the videotape recorder and walked out of the torture chamber, one by one. Several agents threw up in the hot desert sand. Others sat on the steps of David Ray’s white cargo trailer and talked among themselves. For the next four days, Rust went back in the place David called his “toy box” and did her job, making a series of highly detailed black- and- white drawings of all the whips and chains and gigantic dildos and other devices used by David Parker Ray to hurt women. When she was done, she submitted her work to the Evidence Recovery Team in Albuquerque. On Friday morning, April 2, 1999, she met with her boss to discuss the drawings. He told her she’d done a “fantastic job.” Then he told her to go home and relax and try not to think anymore about what she’d seen in the trailer. Later that night, Patricia E. Rust, thirty- six, drove home to her family in El Paso, Texas. Just before midnight, she got out of bed and went downstairs to get her personal handgun. She put the barrel of the gun to her head and pulled the trigger.  There are paragraph breaks but it doesn't look like it likes to paste them."

serialkillers,3b169a,BiscuitCat1,2,Fri Jul 3 04:11:31 2015 UTC,"Oh, I forgot. Sorry. I don't think it said in the book if she died or not. She's not mentioned after that. My assumption is that he killed her. He claimed to have given them amnesia using drugs, etc. But a guy eventually came forward who delivered countless loads of cement to the middle of nowhere to David, he wasn't allowed to see where he dumped the cement, he just followed directions. One time he looked back and saw a lot of tires, David had him filling those up. He asked what the tires were for and was told they were used to the weigh the marina down in the reservoir. I think that driver later saw an FBI request for help about a missing person who may have been a victim and that was when he thought he should come forward.  I would bet my money on Nikkie being cemented inside a tire on the bottom of that lake. But there are a couple things to consider also:  One of his accomplices said during a prison interview with a cop that you could drag the lake all you want you won't find any bodies. The bodies were apparently dumped in a ravine they called ""the pit"" and there used to be a photo of the pit with body parts way down at the bottom. So that's possible. A map was drawn with the location on it.  The survivor who ran from the trailer with the dog collar on said David told her he didn't want to kill her but Cindy would out of jealously, something like that. He said if it were up to him he'd drug her and spend two days giving her amnesia then release her. He mentioned a ""Daisy"" that he had done this to. Mind games? Likely. Truth? Possible. He told his victims that Cindy was meaner than him and so they had better please her well and not fight because she was vicious.   Another victim, identified by a swan tattoo seen in a video David had, was located. She said she'd been having nightmares of events but no actual memories, she didn't know if they were real or not. She said their dildos wouldn't fit and he was frustrated. The video reminded her of how real it all was, she had been hoping they were only nightmares.  On a related note. Here is a good article on this sick freak:  http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2047712/David-Parker-Ray-Police-search-lake-remains-40-victims-sex-fiend.html  The FBI has a section of their website where they show photographs of things they found, they are hoping the public can identify the items. They may belong to victims. It was 34 pages of photos released in 2011."

Dismembered people not out of convenience, but because he had a compulsion to do so.  Didn't sexually assault any victims, it was purely about power and bloodlust.  Killed both male and female.  Was a trained medical professional, people within that field typically don't commit their killings in such a bloody way (live decapitation, every time).  Honestly the biggest thing to me is that he wasn't a rapist.  It seems like almost every killer is a rapist first and killer second, but this is a rare case where there is a complete absence of sexual assault.  This is not to say the killer lacked a sexual connection to his crimes, though."

I mean, he convinced police to release a victim back into his custody. His neighbor thought someone had to be setting him up for something. Once he started confessing everything, the lead detective thought it was a joke until he heard from his boss that they'd found more remains. For Ray, it's his transcript.

He beat the children and tortured them to tender their meat, and after this brutal torture he killed them, ate them, and sent extremely graphic description of everything he did back to the children’s parents.

Some additional information I found, though:   Steve Wright is careful to try to dispose of all evidence linking him to his five victims, cleaning his car and his clothes. However, detectives would find enough traces remaining for forensic examiners to establish a link. Ray Palmer, a lead forensic scientist is one of the hundred experts used in the Suffolk investigation. Palmer and his team find Wright's DNA on three of the women's bodies, while microscopic fibres from his clothing, car and home were discovered on all five.  Another challenge facing investigators was to establish a link between Wright and the missing woman. The answer is to view footage from the many CCTV cameras used in Ipswich and its red light area. Inspector Steve Griss from the specialist CCTV Unit uses surveillance systems and an automatic car number plate reader to identify Wright’s Ford Mondeo car. Suffolk officers wade through up to 10,000 hours of footage to find answers to their questions. Eventually they discover footage showing Wright was in the red light area at the key times when each of the five women had disappeared.   Source."

Any number of requests the lawyers can put forward to jam up the process. A separate area for death row inmates that costs more per prisoner I believe than the general areas. It isn't a quick process either. I think they celebrate in some states when it's done two years after sentencing, while in others its years later, costing more money per year than to lock them up in general population."

One of them he says he will rub musk oil on the woman's vagina and let a German Shepard or some ""horny dogs"" come in to ""screw the women"". One of his victims apparently described this scenario happening. So who knows?   The FBI has 175 pages of the audio tapes. Single spaced. Jim says that he read all of them. He even has ""about 70"" of DPR's drawings he made.  If you buy the kindle book from Amazon for like $6 it has the update in the back.

serialkillers,3avrtd,grizzly8511,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:56:43 2015 UTC,"Livstid? Menar inte att han kommer sitta för alltid, men han kommer troligtvis göra det då hans straff inte är tidsbestämt och vad jag vet så har alla hans försök att få det tidsbestämt nekats. Möjligtvis blir han ihjälslagen av andra fängelsekunder (finns en hotbild och han har blivit nerslagen vid tidigare tillfällen).  Är dock inte jätteinsatt i just hans fall men ja."

I was gonna binge on Netflix tonight but I know I will pop this DVD in the player and step back into time (1995, when this movie came out).  It helps being a Soviet-ophile as well.

serialkillers,3amedu,Qx2J,6,Sun Jun 21 19:42:24 2015 UTC,I wish we knew more about the content of the tapes and their conversations/justifications.  But as far as I know there was only a short clip released with them giving instructions to a victim.  Leonard and Charles were laughing back and forth with excitement like two kids about to play with a new toy. Sidenote: There's a belief that Leonards ex-wife snuck onto his property the night before it was first searched and removed some tapes that likely featured her.  Leonard liked to photograph and video record his lovers as well as his victims.  As far as I know it was never proven that tapes were removed and she was never charged.  The book Die For Me strongly suggested that she removed evidence though.
serialkillers,3amedu,SavageWolf1977,2,Mon Jun 22 06:04:31 2015 UTC,"I always found it weird they showed short segments of the tapes, I've always wondered if there were longer versions the police didn't show. I find it odd that lake would have just stopped filming but then again we may never know."

So, I'm not sure if they've ever been truly released, but I DO think they've been sampled in a limited way."

Ray, the author mentioned having seen the videos. It came up casually in conversation but I remember wondering who has had access to them. The jury wasn't even allowed to see them all, and the defence tactics to have them disallowed were frustrating as hell to read about.  I don't think they played any of them during the interview with Jim Fielder but his interview on True Murder is great. I know he has transcripts in his book, and some video descriptions."
serialkillers,3amedu,CanadianSavage,2,Mon Jun 22 20:39:00 2015 UTC,"DPR had two trials for the rape/kidnapping of Kelly Garrett, because the first trial resulted in a mistrial. The first judge didn't allow the tape to be played, because Kelly didn't remember if David played the tape (and he had a ""this is adult entertainment"" disclaimer -- always one step ahead of the law). But the second judge allowed the ""Hello there bitch. Are you comfortable right now?"" tape to be played. I'm sure the court reporter had a lot of fun transcribing THAT...  I'm wondering if anyone in the ABQ media has access to the tapes. In this KRQE clip, they also play a teaser of a DPR tape. It's definitely his voice if you compare it against interviews he's done. He has kind of a NM cowboy accent, and actually sounds pretty ""gentle"" for a serial torturer/rapist. Maybe KRQE monitors /r/albuquerque -- it'd be awesome to get anyone who was on the scene at Elephant Butte to do an AMA."

His books often give good foundational knowledge as well as field stories that are fascinating. If you like Criminal Minds, he basically founded the BSU ( real life BAU). Mindhunter comes up a lot, but his unsolved mysteries book,  ""Cases that Haunt us"" was so good i couldn't put it down."
serialkillers,3afw9n,pipkin227,3,Fri Jun 19 21:26:14 2015 UTC,"A warning on John Douglas - his books are great as long as you don't use them as a definitive source. It kills me to say it because he was a hero of mine as a kid, but he's really good at making himself look better in retrospect (like with the Wayne Williams case) and he has some really outdated, unfounded beliefs about psychology that were maybe considered accurate 30 years ago. That said... he's a pioneer in the field and nobody is perfect, and his books are thoroughly entertaining. Still... I usually recommend Ressler."

serialkillers,3afw9n,askryan,1 point,Sat Jun 20 21:43:33 2015 UTC,"I tend to prefer more literary true crime — In Cold Blood or Helter Skelter style, rather than Harold Schechter and stuff.   In addition to what's listed here, Lost Girls by Robert Kolker (about the still-unsolved Gilgo Beach murders) is truly, truly exceptional reporting, as is (although about spree killers rather than serial) Columbine by Dave Cullen.   I also prefer Ann Rule's GRK book Green River, Running Red to The Stranger a Beside Me — which is great, but be warned, it glosses over most of Bundy's deep depravity — no mention of his necrophilia or mutilations or anything like that. Green River is excellent, and like Lost Girls spends time with the women who lost their lives in an always-interesting and never cloying way.   Be sure to read Lost Girls everyone!"

The MO's are different, the weapons are different, the victim profiles are different, and the witness descriptions of the suspects are different. POSSIBLE connection? Maybe. Proof of a connection? ZERO. 2. In spite of Graysmith's claims, the letters not only contain wrong ""facts,"" they actually contain information that the actual killer(s) COULD NOT have known. A list of people who did have access to that information includes someone whose handwriting is IDENTICAL to the letters. 3. The phone calls, like the letters, contain more wrong information than correct information. Furthermore, ALL of the information in the phone calls, right and wrong, had been broadcast over police radios. The delay in time between the attacks and the phone call also matches the times of these broadcasts. 4. According to the FBI report of October 23, 1969, all of the fingerprints from the Ferrin murder, the Shepard murder, the Napa phone booth, the Stine murder, and the letters were compared to each other—zero matches. 5. Same goes for what little DNA evidence has survived."

serialkillers,3ad5f0,Misanthropic_Messiah,8,Fri Jun 19 06:22:01 2015 UTC,"Yup:  ""We have a couple of real close friends that we party with once in awhile. They know about our hang-ups and don’t have any problem with fuckin’ a slave. You may be required to service them occasionally. But that’s an easy one, for the most part, just fuckin’ and suckin’. They don’t get into the heavier stuff. However, when we have a party, sometimes I like to put on a little show that you won’t like at all. You’ll be taken into the living room and put on the floor on your hands and knees, naked. Your wrists, ankles, knees and hips will be strapped to a metal frame to hold your body in that position. The frame is designed for doggie fuckin’, your ass up in the air, sex organs exposed, your tits hangin’ down on each side of a metal support bar, knees spread about twelve inches, position similar to that of a bitch dog in heat, right in the middle of the floor so we can set on the couch and in chairs, and watch. I’m going to rub canine breeder’s musk on your back, the back of your neck, and on your sex organs. Now I have three dogs. All of ‘em’s male, cause I don’t need any fuckin’ pups. One of ‘em is a very large German shepherd that is always horny, and he loves it when I bring him in the house to fuck a woman. After I let him in the house, he’ll sniff around you a little bit and, within a minute, he’ll be mounting you. There’s about a 50–50 chance which hole he’ll get his penis into, but it doesn’t seem to bother him whether it’s the pussy or the asshole. His penis is pretty thin. It goes in easy, but it’s about ten inches long and when he gets completely excited, it gets a hell of a knot right in the middle of it. Now I’ve had slaves tell me that it feels like they got a baseball inside of ‘em. It doesn’t take long. He’s gonna hump you real fast for about three or four minutes. And while he’s doin’ it, he’ll wrap his front legs around your chest to hold himself in position. And, in the process, he’ll probably scratch your tits up a little bit, with his claws. After he gets through, he usually turns around and tries to pull out. Oh, he’ll jerk a little, not much, mostly just steady pressure. And I’ve timed it. The knot will usually shrink up enough to come outta your pussy in about three minutes. If he’s in your asshole, about five minutes. I don’t use the dog all that often, but I don’t deprive him of pussy either. There’s no doubt that he’s going to be on you a few times while you’re here, because I like watching it. And any time it’s just you, me and the dog, it will always be in your butt. The dog knot on his penis is big and extremely uncomfortable when he’s, uh, pushing it back and forth way up in her anus. I really enjoy watching a girl wiggle, jerk and squirm around while he’s doing it. Consequently, I give him a little, uh, assistance getting it in the right hole. Now if you think all of this stuff is sick and depraved, you haven’t seen anything yet. This is a different world. Among our small circle of friends, little things like rape, kidnapping, doggie fucking, stuff like that, are every-day occurrences. Matter of course. Here, anything can happen and often does."""

I mean, who tf sends bikini pics to an incarcerated rapist and murderer who killed and tortured so many innocent people, who raped and sodomized mothers in front of their traumatized children?

It staggers me that there are people who not only CAN inflict the kind of incredible harm that serial killers do, but get off on it.

It was barely more than a true crime show with a minimal amount of drama thrown in.  They wanted the press to not say who the killer was till after the second of two shows aired, but I knew it was Bundy when they showed the VW Beetle in the first ad for the show."

Personally, I would have thought Bundy because he was well respected and charming, but of course because the first one was him, it couldn't be. Dahmer was always a bit of an odd duck and I believe Gacy was too. Maybe Ridgeway? I don't know much about his personality, but he got away with it for so long, it could be. I googled serial killers referred to as""The Chameleon"" and Elaine Parent, but I'm unfamiliar with her.  As for the first serial thriller, anyone who has seen the movie Bundy will agree that this series was just flat compared to the acting in the movie. I don't know. I'm holding onto hope that they will learn from this one and make improvements for December."
serialkillers,3a2kcj,aubreywashername,2,Wed Jun 17 00:21:14 2015 UTC,"It made me think it was a movie made with just those crime recreations you see on CI. Production values poor, and acting lame. Ted didn't even look like Ted. The worst bit was how they tried to keep his identity secret by not saying his name until the middle of the second part. As soon as they mentioned a ""good-looking guy was reported bothering ladies at Lake Sammamish"" that gave the game away about 5 minutes into the first ep.  I read in Variety they were planning a theatrical release of this outside America. That made me laugh.  Overall, a piss poor production."

Anyone have any idea who that is about?"
serialkillers,3a2kcj,uglyorgan46,2,Wed Jun 17 16:44:22 2015 UTC,"The acting and the characters were pretty poor choosing and they hurried it along leaving out the most credible stuff that made Bundy who he was.

serialkillers,3a3735,ayyelemayyoh,3,Tue Jun 16 21:36:06 2015 UTC,"There are two Bundy quotes that could be great attention grabbers.   We serial killers are your sons, we are your husbands, we are everywhere. And there will be more of your children dead tomorrow""  ""Well-meaning, decent people will condemn the behavior of a Ted Bundy, while they're walking past a magazine rack full of the very kinds of things that send young kids down the road to be Ted Bundys.""  In the second quote he is speaking on pornagraphy but it can be interpreted a number of different ways. There is also a good quote from Ramirez;  “We’ve all got the power in our hands to kill, but most people are afraid to use it. The ones who aren’t afraid, control life itself.”  The portrayal of a serial killer as someone you could be neighbors with has always frightened me more than them being labeled as the devil incarnate or the boogeyman. These people exist. They do horrific things. It isn't a television show. People died in terrible, terrible ways. The reality of a Chikatilo, Bundy, Panzram, etc is a frightening take."
serialkillers,3a3735,jdavenp3,2,Wed Jun 17 04:23:22 2015 UTC,"Jeffrey Dahmer telling Stone Phillips that he blames his crimes on in his belief in evolution is one of my favorites. Yeah...evolution makes people eat each other.  ‘If a person doesn’t think there is a God to be accountable to, then—then what’s the point of trying to modify your behaviour to keep it within acceptable ranges? That’s how I thought anyway. I always believed the theory of evolution as truth, that we all just came from the slime. When we, when we died, you know, that was it, there is nothing…’  I also like Aileen Wuornos in court dropping this little nugget: ""May your wife and children be raped...right in the ass."""

The first lady who was in love with the night stalker exchanged like over 700 letters and he would ask her about her shaven pussy and her daughter. When she met him in person she freaked out and never saw him again. Even the documentarian said this was petty love and decided to go film another subject. She went to a second lady who works for an prisoners advocacy group and married a prisoner who was her friends brother. She started contact after he killed someone. She eventually married him and had like 4 children. Her husband was locked up in several facilities including San Quentin. She was genuinely in love with him. The third person was a dude named John Whitehouse who was married to Susan Atkins from the Manson family.  He was so in love with her, a genuine one also, applied, got accepted to, and enrolled in harvard law to fight her appeal and was her personal lawyer. Even represented her when fighting for a compassionate early release. pretty good documentary, I believe its by a French group, the Interviewer's name was Clementine."

serialkillers,39py51,danielkurlan,22,Sat Jun 13 16:47:51 2015 UTC,"Dahmer was pretty forthcoming about everything his did, why wouldn't he confess to killing Adam Walsh if he did kill him? There were probably more predators in Florida than you can imagine at the time being, it's pretty easy/convenient to throw this entire thing on Dahmer.  That being said, I was never satisfied that Ottis Toole killed Adam Walsh either.    Remember the five decapitation cases that happened near Jeffrey's army base in Germany during the time he spent there?   Never heard of these cases and I would really like some information on them."
serialkillers,39py51,FAST_AND_GREAT,10,Sat Jun 13 17:20:01 2015 UTC,"I find op's theory quite interesting but I'm not really swayed away from Toole either.   I think people think way too highly of Dahmer. He's the serial killer that people somehow have sympathy for, and take him by his word on everything. So he admitted to some murders? And? Bundy admitted to some murders and left out others, it's all part of the mind game. Dahmer was a born manipulator and many people have fallen into the sympathy trap. People always throw out there that he needed to be ""blacked out drunk to kill"" and he hated it. I don't buy that for a minute. He was in control and happy from the time he picked a victim to the point where he ate them and I wouldn't put anything passed him."
serialkillers,39py51,ronniejean1,7,Sat Jun 13 22:55:05 2015 UTC,"Not that I agree with OP's  theory, but it's possible he wouldn't have confessed to this particular crime because the death penalty was legal in Florida at the time. Given the publicity surrounding both Dahmer's case and the abduction and murder of Adam Walsh, it wouldn't be too hard to believe that if Dahmer was the culprit he would keep it under wraps. There's not a jury in the world who wouldn't have put him on death row if it was a possibility, especially if you add Adam Walsh onto his already high body count."
serialkillers,39py51,titans_daughter,2,Sat Jun 13 18:26:29 2015 UTC,"While I agree with that, IMHO he seems to only be open with the killings that fell into his ""I need companionship"" reasoning. Stuff like this would make him look like a hypocrite."
serialkillers,39py51,StendhalSyndrome,11,Tue Jun 23 04:02:29 2015 UTC,"I don't know man. Interesting theory, but Dahmer was a homosexual who killed for company, basically. He felt safe connecting to these men who ""could never leave him (paraphrase)."" There's no evidence he had an interest in children, sexual or otherwise.  Plus, once caught he readily confessed to murders that he wasn't even suspected of, like the hitchhiker you mentioned. Confessing to crimes got him more attention than he'd ever had in his whole rotten, lonely life. I have my doubts that he'd omit it if he was responsible for one of the most prolific abduction/murder cases in the past 50 years."

serialkillers,39py51,abbie_yoyo,6,Sun Jun 14 05:54:36 2015 UTC,To say dahmer killed for company is naive imo.  That's the reasoning he gave for the crimes but serial killers tend to be habitual liars and on top of that he was probably trying to justify his own actions to himself. He was sexually perverse and had control issues and openly said he wanted sex slaves who would never leave him. If it was as simple as just wanting company and for them to leave why didn't he just gag them and have them tied up? He didn't need drill holes in their brains and pour battery acid in the open wounds.  People make excuses foe him. He was a sick guy.

I don't want to hurt people. I would only imagine my own fear or pain in the course of doing so and be revolted by it. I know this for a fact from getting into fights as a kid - whenever the tables turned and I became the dominant one, my adrenaline would pass and I'd look at the kid I beat up and feel terrible.

serialkillers,39mar5,_rattlesnake,10,Fri Jun 12 19:07:17 2015 UTC,"I bought a copy of ""Invisible Killer"" at a secondhand books shop after watching the Dr. Phil episode about Charlie Brandt.  It's not the best edited book I've read, but it was insightful.  I don't think for a moment that we have any concept of the scope of this man's murderous criminal career.  The specificity and brutality of the crimes, when paired with his wife and sister's repeated questioning of events which Brandt dismissed with flimsy covers, lead me to believe that he had had a lot of practice and was sort of spiraling and getting sloppy.  The final acts were at the very bottom of that spiral, and he lost all control.  I think he knew there was no way he could avoid suspicion any longer nor could he face what he'd done.  Just my thoughts.  Book info:  http://www.amazon.com/Invisible-Killer-Monster-Behind-Mask/dp/0988860511/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1434136612&sr=8-1&keywords=charlie+brandt"

serialkillers,39hpp9,ronniejean1,14,Fri Jun 12 07:56:45 2015 UTC,"Nice pics. I'm just going to comment with a question I have because yours is the most recent post about him and maybe you can even provide some insight.  People seem to have sympathy for Dahmer, more so than other serial killers. Why? I've read about his lonely life and everything he went through - I'm no monster, but I feel nothing about his life or in any way feel sorry for him after what he's done.  People also comment on how Dahmer had remorse and he hated killing and he had to be black out drunk to go through with it. Are there articles about this? How do we know he was black out drunk? I find it hard to believe he was blacked out from the time he got his victim...all the way through eating them. I feel like I'm missing a large piece of information here.  I've watched interviews and such, and he seems to show remorse...but how do we know that isn't for show? They're born manipulators."
serialkillers,39hpp9,SingeSabre,21,Thu Jun 11 20:35:05 2015 UTC,"it has troubled me for a long time, but I do have lots of sympathy for Dahmer, and I can't even really explain why. his life, his case is so brutal but so sad at the same time.  he was obviously a very sick man, but I think he could've been helped and the crimes could've been prevented, if he would've had some sort of therapy.  as for your question, here;s what I think: he stated in his confessions that he hated the act of killing, and that he had to be absolutely drunk to go through with it. it's what came after the killing, that he truly wanted and where he got his satisfaction from. from what I've read he was a heavy drinker from the age of 13/14.  he wasn't blacked out from start to finish, that's for sure. he just needed to be REALLY drunk to kill.  and when he started to to try to create his sex-zombies, he had no intentions to actually kill the person  Dahmer hated to receive anal sex, so he started to mix sleeping pills into the drinks of his sexual partners to be in total control. and then it all totally spiraled out of control over time.  all his life all he wanted was total control, and to have someone that would never leave him.   I do think his remorse was sincere. if you look at the likes of Bundy and his famous last interview, I do not buy a word Bundy was saying, but with Dahmer I have a feeling that he knew he was a sick man that had destroyed the lifes of so many people. he also stated that he wished he could die for his crimes.   I hope this makes sense, I am slightly intoxicated this evening."
serialkillers,39hpp9,ronniejean1,3,Thu Jun 11 21:04:29 2015 UTC,"When I first learned about Dahmer, I felt a similar sense of sympathy and it's possible he could have truly felt remorse for these atrocities.  On the other hand, those of us feeling sympathy for him could just be more victims playing into his madness. He can no longer control people in jail, so now his ultimate control is to get others to feel sorry for him, even through his crimes are so awful and psychotic that they are beyond redemption.   Dahmer was never sympathetic when he took away people's lives, people's children. And even though he put on a convincing remorseful act, I do not believe he deserves one ounce of our sympathy."
serialkillers,39hpp9,ronniejean1,4,Fri Jun 12 19:48:53 2015 UTC,"This is how I feel about it too. The only time I got a slight tinge of sympathy was when I was watching his mother's interview. I don't know why, but the woman irked me and she seemed like an awful mother to have."
serialkillers,39hpp9,ronniejean1,7,Sat Jun 13 01:54:23 2015 UTC,"Hahaha thanks for the response, it all makes sense. Hasn't changed my mind though, I still don't feel sorry for him but perhaps I'm heartless. I just don't buy the blacked out drunk part."
serialkillers,39hpp9,mws85,8,Thu Jun 11 21:11:27 2015 UTC,"haha, cheers. I am not here to change anyone's mind about the guy.   what I forgot to mention, first time he killed was a hitch hiker, then he had a looong ""cooling off"" period. years after he started frequenting gay bars and clubs and he would start drugging his partners. the second time he killed, Dahmer states that he can not remember it at all. he just woke up in a Hotel room with this dead guy underneath him. he says he must've beaten him to death but he was blacked out and can't remember a second of it. but that's when the killing spree started. so I think the fact that he can't remember that second murder, in his mind, he might have been thinking ""I need to get back to that state in order to do this again"", if you know what I mean?"
serialkillers,39hpp9,pinkfatticorn,4,Thu Jun 11 21:18:50 2015 UTC,"The state of mind thing makes sense but it only seemed to be reported he was blacked out for that second murder IIRC. I don't know, I just hope his victims families don't read this stuff. I have a loose association with one of his victims extended family so Dahmer sympathy is lost on me."
serialkillers,39hpp9,tankcopter,5,Thu Jun 11 21:54:37 2015 UTC,I very much doubt therapy would of 'fixed' him. He was a psychopath with sexual perversions. That's not something that's really curable. It can probably be managed to an extent but that's about it.
serialkillers,39hpp9,pinkfatticorn,5,Fri Jun 12 01:14:42 2015 UTC,"Actually, its widely debated if he was indeed a psychopath. That is one of the things that makes him most interesting in my opinion. He doesnt fit the DSM criteria outlined for antisocial personality disorder, either the current version 5, or the one that was in use at the time. His score was above average at 22, but the cut off score is 30. So as you can see, not APD. I found a really good write up of some of the possible diagnosis and paraphilias that suit him better. I think the most likely of the ones listed are the BPD and personality disorder not otherwise specified.   source"
serialkillers,39hpp9,tankcopter,3,Fri Jun 12 07:09:55 2015 UTC,"I never really specified in my last post, but you're right, I'd be skeptical of anyone saying he was a psychopath. The source you linked is really interesting; especially the discussion of how a root difficulty in interacting and connecting with others due to Asperger's syndrome could have fed into his fantasies and need for a totally submissive partner, while the tendency to be obsessively interested in specific topics (dead things) could have formed into paraphilias.  I was mostly trying to say that regardless of precisely what diagnoses he might have, with proper help it would have been entirely possible to manage them or prevent them from occurring in the first place, but I ended up rambling a bit I think."
serialkillers,39hpp9,Its_Porsch-ah,3,Fri Jun 12 07:58:29 2015 UTC,"I do think that his need to keep people with him and fear of abandonment is a pretty big indicator of BPD. Intense fear of abandonment is a key part of BPD and I think that it just got jumbled into his other paraphilias.   I do take issue in this article stating that people with asperger's do not have empathy, that has been debunked many times, so disregard that portion. As a person with Asperger's it really annoys me when people say that. Of course, people with Aspergers can also have personality disorders which inhibit empathy, such things are not mutually exclusive. However, it is not actually true with just autism. They just do not show empathy in a typical fashion. Sorry, that bugs me a lot."
serialkillers,39hpp9,magnetarball,6,Fri Jun 12 20:10:52 2015 UTC,"Therapy wouldn't have 'fixed' him, certainly, but a therapist would have been able to help him find healthier and less illegal methods of coping with his feelings, as well as a space for him to discuss them. Failing that, once he started talking about how he drugged a sex partner and considered killing them, he probably would have been admitted and been unable to kill people anyway.   Dahmer didn't just wake up one day and decide he was going to murder young boys and keep parts of them in his house; he did worrying things as a kid and if there had been better mental health services available to him then I think his problems could have been managed pretty well.   Reading about a lot of serial killers, there were earlier signs that they needed psychological help or that they were very much unwell and needed closer monitoring than they got (Gary Heidnik comes to mind, the crimes he ended up committing are horrible but the fact that he was released from a mental institution and then left to his own devices without any follow up is incredible to me, same with Shawcross and Kemper).  Personally I do feel some sympathy for Dahmer, he had some serious problems and seemed to show genuine remorse. I still think he was a terrible person who did terrible things, but if his unusual behaviour was noticed sooner, he could very well have led a normal life.   He made the ultimate choice in what did, but his circumstances also pushed him in that direction and then allowed him to continue doing it. He was a loner, his parents never paid much attention to him, he drank from an early age, and as an adult he clearly had problems (you would think that if your grandson was trying to dissolve dead squirrels in chemicals in your basement, that you might want to take him to see a psychiatrist).   Yet he ended up living alone, in an area where he could get away with simply picking up men from gay bars or off the street without anyone questioning their disappearance, and nobody in his life seemed that interested in what he was up to. There were so many opportunities for him to get help that could have prevented his actions, but nobody around him seemed to notice, and it's that fact that makes me ultimately feel sorry for him."

serialkillers,39hpp9,mws85,4,Fri Jun 12 07:36:02 2015 UTC,"My thought was always that he himself seemed to want to understand why he did the terrible things he did, and how he felt such remorse, and needed to be blackout drunk to do the horrible things he did. I don't think he remorse was faked, but it certainly wasn't enough to overcome his murderous urges. I actually felt bad when he was murdered in prison - not for him as a person, but because he genuinely wanted to be studied by doctors and behaviorists, in the hopes that he could help prevent other killers like himself.  He knew how perverted and sick he was, and how what he was doing was very wrong and evil. Ted Bundy's appeals lawyer said something that has stuck with me for years. She said that legally, if you know what you're doing is wrong, you're sane, but how can you murder 40 women and not be insane?  And then of course there was Dahmer's poor father, who tried so hard to understand where he failed in raising a son who grew up to do such awful things. It was tragic all the way around."

We all do things we shouldn't, and lots of us do pretty Terrible things either intentionally or through negligence.   For me his life and struggle doesn't lose value because he took the lives of others, because I don't hold anyone's actions against them when it comes to matters of mental or physical illness.   It's the same way I can't really bring myself to hate the men in videos beheading people overseas. There is something that caused them to be in that situation that I cannot understand, and most of them feel that they are doing the right thing.   When I was younger I got very drunk several times and drove home to my dorm room, I never got in an accident aside from backing my bumper into a pole at a friends house, but each time I was making an impaired decision that put others lives at risk. Is it the same as deciding to kill a partner? No, but the fact of the matter is in my impaired judgement I made the wrong decision."
serialkillers,39hpp9,kittenernst,-3,Thu Jun 11 22:18:06 2015 UTC,"Bit of a Dahmer enthusiast here, just a little opinion on this- Jeffrey has been my favourite (however morbid it is to have a favourite) serial killer since I very first got interested (about three years back), and I spent TONS of time looking into every little thing about him. I have lots of sympathy for him.  He killed for love, not for the sake of murder. He wanted someone completely submissive to him (he just needed a good BDSM club tbh), and at first it was all accidental. He meant to make his victims more like zombies (zombie sex slaves, hell yeah) than anything, not to kill them. He tried some different methods, each of which ended up killing his victims more than merely drugging them. I mean, the whole reason he ate parts of his victims was so that they would become/remain a part of him. He acted as if the corpses were alive for a while after they had died (and before dismembering them to eat them). He would talk to them, cuddle with them, all that jazz. Kinda cute in a morbid sort of way.  I know he kept some things (heads, biceps, torsos, penises, etc.) to eat and others to sort of use as decorations. I believe his remorse was legitimate, I don't think he was a bad person. He wanted love and it went too far. He drank a lot, definitely too much, but I believe he was decently sober and aware of what he was doing when he did it. What he did was wrong, yeah, but I don't think he was motivated by some need for cold-blooded murder."

Check out ""the Jeffrey Dahmer files"" on Netflix if you haven't seen it yet. The conversations with Pamela bass and detective Pat are really enlightening. It shows how much of a human being Dahmer still was. I think at any given time if he had met the right person or confided in the right therapist, he could have led a normal life.   Pamela (his neighbor) talks about how she cried when she heard he was killed in prison. This highlights the hardest thing society has to handle with serial killers: they aren't monsters, they're people. They love and laugh and behave largely like normal folks, but have urges and fantasies they never found a safe outlet for.   I wish dahmers victims were still alive, and I wish he was too. A life is a life."

I too think he could've lived a pretty normal life if he would've gotten/or sought help.   in the trial one of his psychologists says that she talked to Dahmer and he told her that he wouldn't have killed, if the person he was with would've agreed to stay with him for at least a few weeks. it's fucking sad."

My wife isn't naive for forgiving me for attempting suicide. Just because a person forgives doesn't make them somehow less of a person. I would argue it makes them a better person than if they were bitter and held a grudge their whole lives.   There are numerous cases of people forgiving those who murdered their loved ones. There are also many more who harbor a deep seated hatred for those who killed their loved ones. Which of these two lives a happier and healthier life?

serialkillers,39hpp9,oda2-0,2,Thu Jun 11 21:48:10 2015 UTC,"He didn't seem to have the seething malice and narcissicism of a lot of other serial killers, he seemed more pathetic and selfish, and I think on some level a lot of people can relate to pathetic and selfish.   I don't know if he could have been helped, but he's one of the few where it's even a question I'd consider.   Someone described him here as a child having a tantrum, and I think there's something to that. He just seemed manipulative and selfish in the way a child is. I don't think he was all that cunning with his manipulation of sympathy for him, I think it was just his nature to be like that and he didn't know he was doing it.  This is just colored by the speculation that he had bpd. I know many people with bpd, and in spite of the fact that they do awful things, I am not sure they're aware of it, so I still have some level of sympathy. I was in an abusive relationship with someone with bpd, so maybe it's residual stockholm syndrome, but I don't think his manipulation was at all calculated, it was so natural and that's what made him a master of it. I think Dahmer was like that."
serialkillers,39hpp9,chizmack,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:18:17 2015 UTC,"You should watch the interview with him and his father, it's quite odd to watch. While watching it I started feeling empathetic towards him and then I'd remember who he was and what he did..the sad thing IMO is that his actions were spurred out absolute gut-wrenching loneliness that he dealt with his whole life. If I recall correctly his motive for trying to create 'zombies' was that he wanted someone that wouldn't want to leave him."

serialkillers,39bymb,keepyourheart,51,Wed Jun 10 19:01:37 2015 UTC,"He looks like a different person in almost every photo.  Edit: Turns out it was completely on purpose.   The real Ted Bundy was a chameleon, a man who could--and did--change his appearance often. He cultivated a derelict`s stubble; grew various beards, moustaches; wore glasses.  He gained and lost weight so rapidly as to change his facial features dramatically. Often he fasted for days to make those changes more rapid, and once, in a Glenwood Springs, Colo., jail, he did it so he could fit through a foot-square opening above his jail cell lighting fixture to make good his second escape--the one that brought him to Florida.   http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1986-05-04/entertainment/8602010094_1_theodore-robert-bundy-margaret-bowman-florida-state-university-students"

serialkillers,39bymb,eeebooboo,21,Wed Jun 10 21:31:35 2015 UTC,his wife divorced him in 1986.  pretty sure they changed the girls name and as far as I know she managed to stay out of the public's eye.
serialkillers,39bymb,mws85,-3,Wed Jun 10 21:35:36 2015 UTC,How old would his daughter be now? Also without meaning to be graphic- how did he end up being able get a woman pregnant when he was on death row?!
serialkillers,39bymb,psycho_watcher,11,Thu Jun 11 01:48:14 2015 UTC,"The only 2 articles I have saved.  http://imgur.com/a/WXJ3K  Carol also had an older son named Jamie who was said to be very fond of Ted Bundy. There is supposedly an interview with him out there where he discusses him. I haven't seen it.  His daughter was born in 1981 and since her parents divorced in 86 I am guessing that she knows who her dad was (or is suuposed to be) and she does not speak about it.  Carol disappeared after the divorce as well.  Ann Rule said this about his daughter  ""I have deliberately avoided knowing anything about Ted's ex-wife and daughter's whereabouts because they deserve privacy. I don't want to know where they are; I never want to be caught off guard by some reporter's question about them. All I know is that Ted's daughter has grown up to be a fine young woman. ""  http://www.authorannrule.com/Ted_Bundy_Updates.html  Oh and many people think that they bribed guards to let them into the bathroom to do it. Other people have confirmed that kind of thing did go on and since Ted had a 'good' relationship with most workers at the prison (remember he knew how to 'work people') it is not hard to believe."
serialkillers,39bymb,Soperos,13,Thu Jun 11 05:39:33 2015 UTC,Before he was on death row...........?
serialkillers,39bymb,mws85,-5,Thu Jun 11 02:01:56 2015 UTC,True. I'm not sure of the dates surrounding it.
serialkillers,39bymb,Disproves,2,Thu Jun 11 02:17:11 2015 UTC,"there's three versions I head about it.   first, it mightn't be his child at all.   then I read that inmates and their spouses in Florida state prison would regularly bribe the prison guards and they would let them have sex behind a soda machine and turn a blind eye. there's more than one mention about it from other inmates, so that seems plausible.   and then there's the story that Carole smuggled in a condom in her mouth, then kissed Bundy (that was apparently allowed) he then went to the bathroom, ejaculated into it, put it back in his mouth and then swapped it back to her and she then went to the ladies room."
serialkillers,39bymb,Soperos,5,Thu Jun 11 07:46:00 2015 UTC,"That is not definitely his daughter. It is claimed that Carol got pregnant outside of the prison and claimed the child was his, but the warden stated that there is no way they would have been allowed that kind of physical contact."

serialkillers,39bymb,moonrabbit92,16,Thu Jun 11 01:13:11 2015 UTC,"This is why he grabbed our attention. Not to brush things off lightly, but before we saw him and learned about him, we all ""thought"" we'd know who the scary guy in the group was. Take a look at Henry Lee Lucas; no woman in her right mind would get anywhere near him, let alone do something like jump in his car willingly. Ted was handsome, intelligent, seemingly a man who was on his way to the top. For him to turn into the monster next door blew the doors off for us, the public."
serialkillers,39bymb,CorporalSNAFU,7,Thu Jun 11 02:42:23 2015 UTC,"That's why I'm interested to know how he was to be around. Nothing sets off those fight-or-flight senses in those pictures.

serialkillers,3960rp,uncle-woody,30,Tue Jun 9 14:40:07 2015 UTC,That is a terrible sketch...
serialkillers,3960rp,AustinCT,10,Tue Jun 9 14:50:44 2015 UTC,"Well let's be fair to the sketch artist, Bundy is today acknowledged by many as having been a master of disguise, able to totally warp perceptions of him, with nothing more than the simple feat of his hair being combed in a slightly different way, or growing a mere spattering of facial hair."

serialkillers,3960rp,BrianW1999,8,Wed Jun 10 01:23:24 2015 UTC,"Imagine if Bundy used an alias and they didn't have his first name. Imagine if they were searching for a ""Bob."" Maybe it would have been harder to catch him?"
serialkillers,3960rp,Soperos,5,Tue Jun 9 20:42:54 2015 UTC,"I know, I thought of this too... why the hell would he use his real name?"
serialkillers,3960rp,genius_waitress,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:57:26 2015 UTC,"It wouldn't have mattered. At least four different people reported him to the cops, believing him to be the killer, but the cops didn't think it could be a nice law student. It was a random traffic stop that ultimately led to his arrest."
serialkillers,3960rp,BrianW1999,3,Wed Jun 10 02:29:39 2015 UTC,How many of the people that reported him to the cops knew his name was Ted?
serialkillers,3960rp,genius_waitress,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:32:27 2015 UTC,"All of them. One was his girlfriend. They knew him, and when the description came out, they thought, ""That's him!"""
serialkillers,3960rp,BrianW1999,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:34:53 2015 UTC,"That's my point. If he had used an alias, it wouldn't have been so obvious that it was him. The sketch doesn't really look like him, the height was wrong and the hair color was wrong as well."
serialkillers,3960rp,genius_waitress,3,Wed Jun 10 02:38:46 2015 UTC,"You're completely misunderstanding. It was not obvious. The sketch and info said the guy was called ""Ted."" Four people who knew Ted Bundy told the cops he fit the description. The cops said, ""Nah, he's not the guy.""   Knowing his name helped them in no way whatsoever. It potentially could have, but they ignored the people who tried to help. Random events (the traffic stop, and the creepy stuff in his car) led to his ultimate arrest."
serialkillers,3960rp,BrianW1999,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:42:41 2015 UTC,"That's what you think. Bundy having 4 friends reporting him to the cops put them on their radar plus many people around him knew. The police stop ultimately led to his capture, but you have no idea about the inner workings of the police."
serialkillers,3960rp,genius_waitress,2,Wed Jun 10 02:52:00 2015 UTC,"And none of that has anything to do with his name being Ted. Those friends were close enough to have recognized the description of him and his car, even if he'd been heard to say his name was Bojangles.   you have no idea about the inner workings of the police.     More than the average non-cop, perhaps, but it doesn't matter. I definitely have plenty of reading comprehension skills."

serialkillers,3960rp,Soperos,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:27:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah.. I  mean I think of it by putting myself in their shoes. I would be terrible at guessing a person's height, and I imagine a lot of people are the same in that regard."

serialkillers,394ohh,FAST_AND_GREAT,7,Tue Jun 9 13:23:37 2015 UTC,"I agree. The victims have met the ultimate in cruelty, their families are shattered, completely shattered and are never the same obviously. The families are victims too. Take for instance, Robin Samsoe's brother. He was 16 when she was murdered by Rodney Alcala. In a statement he read in court, he stated that the brutal abduction of his sister and all those myriad feelings left in him turned him into a troubled young man with drugs and crime. Their mother never worked again. She was so unstable that she couldn't hold down a job. I won't even get into the Bundy victims' families. Meanwhile, Bundy was allowed to get married. The list goes on..."
serialkillers,394ohh,uncle-woody,5,Tue Jun 9 14:47:25 2015 UTC,Didn't even think about the impact on victims families that just makes it even worse
serialkillers,394ohh,Soperos,5,Tue Jun 9 22:51:39 2015 UTC,And no one thinks of the families of serial killers.
serialkillers,394ohh,Surfacetovolume,7,Thu Jun 11 02:12:32 2015 UTC,"Morbid, maybe, but it makes sense. The victim was just a regular person going about their daily life, and got murdered. The killer was the one whose behavior is noteworthy."
serialkillers,394ohh,Surfacetovolume,2,Tue Jun 9 18:52:08 2015 UTC,Its true. Someone can be wiped away from existence just for being a normal member of the human race. Someone who murders them lives on
serialkillers,394ohh,MadeUpInOhio,2,Tue Jun 9 22:50:20 2015 UTC,In the same sense that most of us ordinary people are wiped away from existence after we die. Said as someone who is totally comfortable with that.
serialkillers,394ohh,Soperos,6,Tue Jun 16 19:02:50 2015 UTC,"Someone I knew in college was an accessory to murder in a pretty morbid case. After I saw a show about it, I learned the name of the man killed. And I found pages online his family had made talking about his life. I felt this weird sense of need to learn about the victim. To think of him when I think of my old acquaintance. It makes the whole thing more real. His part in it more tangible. Knowing that if he had done thins differently that wonderful person would still be around."

He didn't do anything to stop it, regardless of the fact that it took like 10 or 15 minutes to kill him and any medical intervention would have saved his life. The man I know was bigger than the man doing the killing, and had every opportunity to stop it. He also did aome bizarre things at the scene that attempted to derail the investigation."
serialkillers,394ohh,Flyonz,2,Thu Jun 11 13:14:18 2015 UTC,Thanks for this personal account. Very interesting indeed
serialkillers,394ohh,Psychopath-,3,Fri Jun 12 05:31:00 2015 UTC,"It's definitely true. I can think the names of literally one or two people murdered by serial killers (Anna McFall and Heather West), and that's only because of my extensive reading on the Wests.   But I think the top comment is incredibly right in saying that it would be torture for the families to hear the victims and the horrible things done to each specific person mentioned constantly.   Ultimately though, I think it's a byproduct of the reason people talk about killers in the first place. People are curious about what caused their actions, they want to disect their history and find a reason (our brains always need a reason for everything, it's why we have religion and it's why the mentally ill often cause fear, because their motives are often a mystery). The killers themselves become some interesting mystery, but the victims only inspire sadness."
serialkillers,394ohh,Flyonz,2,Tue Jun 9 17:08:19 2015 UTC,Its a great reasoning. Though as you say quite sad
serialkillers,394ohh,Psychopath-,3,Tue Jun 9 22:50:57 2015 UTC,"Good ob. I reckon its pretty much media led, especially now. If you take Leopold and Leob. They were never given an anti-hero monicker? 'The Stuck Up Stabbers' or anything. They were tried as two murderers who thought they had a right to take the life of 12 yr old Nathan Franks and executed. His name was as prominent as theirs at the time too. I think its a sad indictment on the times we live in tttt? Our 'guides' (politicians, media) really don't give a fuck about us? I mean, they never did before but at least there was some balance? Now you can kill 20 people and become a superstar ..."
serialkillers,394ohh,Flyonz,3,Tue Jun 9 10:52:11 2015 UTC,"Leopold and Loeb weren't executed. Loeb was murdered in prison and Leopold was eventually released. People knew Bobby Franks's name because his father was a wealthy, well-known member of the community and he was their only victim, not one among dozens."
serialkillers,394ohh,IapetusMoon,-1,Tue Jun 9 21:48:16 2015 UTC,"Cant believe I did that. Still, I do think the point I make has some sense to it? Thanks for the pointer, Leopold being murdered kind of says something of the time too. I'll go refresh on this.. thanx Psychopath"
serialkillers,394ohh,Ayn_Rand_Was_Right,2,Wed Jun 10 00:25:03 2015 UTC,"Loeb was murdered, actually. Leopold was eventually released. Loeb was stabbed in prison. His attacker told several stories but the consensus seems to be that a confrontation escalated to murder when Loeb either refused to submit to a sexual assault or declined to pay his killer a bribe or protection money. It's an interesting crime, though. Neither of them seemed like they would have become killers on their own, but together they developed their philosophy of ubermensch and convinced both themselves and each other that they could therefore kill without legal or social consequence. They murdered Bobby Franks as an intellectual exercise - not even because they particularly wanted to, but just to prove to themselves that they could."

They're creepy stories that have no evidence, but we're still fascinated about the act not about the victim."
serialkillers,394ohh,SolusJ,2,Tue Jun 9 15:10:23 2015 UTC,"Along with the horrendous actions of a killer, we wonder about their psyche. What made the person a killer? What could cause anyone to do something so terrible, especially multiple times?"
serialkillers,394ohh,Ayn_Rand_Was_Right,3,Sat Jun 13 19:38:20 2015 UTC,The victim only had to go about their life to become a victim while a killer had to go through some amazing shit to become the killer. Kinda like how you follow around Harry Potter in the novels rather than that one hufflepuff student who is just going to school to get a boring job. The killer is so much more interesting than the victims.
serialkillers,394ohh,SolusJ,2,Tue Jun 9 09:48:54 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily had to go through the ""amazing shit"" you're on about, some people just find curiosity that leads into enjoyment."

Also there is mention of how he hid one of his first victims in the crawl space of the house before moving it again and disposing of the body - well the crawl space is literally a 3X3 space so when I opened it and went in it was clear that I was standing exactly in the same spot his victim was..."

The core characteristics of alexithymia are marked dysfunction in emotional awareness, social attachment, and interpersonal relating.  Furthermore, individuals suffering from alexithymia also have difficulty in distinguishing and appreciating the emotions of others, which is thought to lead to unempathic and ineffective emotional responding.  Alexithymia is prevalent in approximately 10% of the general population and is known to be comorbid with a number of psychiatric conditions.

I have some pretty extreme alexithymia. Very, very confusing when it is in combination with gender dysphoria. And when acting. (I do a ton of theatre. I only learned what most of my emotions were by living them on stage and people, after a show, telling me how they liked ""such and such"" part because it really exemplified ""insert emotion here"")  Feelings are crazy."

I'm sure it must be difficult for you to navigate social situations without feeling too much like you're ""pretending to be there"". Do you experience social anxieties because the potential exists to ""fuck up"" via missed social cues .. .or do you not experience anxiety at all?  My innate scientific and psychological curiosity forces me to ask this question: Are you a fan of serial killers because you worry you might have ""a touch of that"" (for lack of a better term) because you experience this social construct of non-emotion - and that has been too often classified as a psycho- or socio-pathic tendency?

My earliest memories, from 4-5, were watching slasher films with her. We would laugh at the people being butchered. Once a few years had passed (8-9) I got into reading about them. She had books on Bundy, Dahmer, Gacy and others that I would just tear into before bed. I even got in trouble for taking one to school to read at lunch. I never got bogged down with psycho/sociopath labels cause my parents were very adamant in teaching me that I was not one.

It largely relied on anecdotal evidence, but there's been a serious shift into viewing it in terms of empirical evidence. ""Investigative psychology"" is about 20 years old, so it's still very young and still needs to be critiqued. But there are elements of crime scenes that are common (thus no identifying or distinguishing factors) and others are salient. Salient features are important for linking crime scenes. But overall, profiling is a tool. It may not tell you the specifics, but the goal is to narrow down a suspect pool. What you listed is the way thats kind of being overhauled."

The first few victims found were all strangled, the later victims who had been there for quite some time had been dismembered (some, anyway). Why all of a sudden the shift?

serialkillers,394239,trubleshanks,5,Tue Jun 9 13:36:51 2015 UTC,"Nah dude if you add Genghis you gotta add people like Julius Caesar, Alexander, Charlemagne, etc etc. They lived in completely different times and thought and lived nothing like us at all, can't project on to them our values of the contemporary. That's how it was on the Steppe. Ghengis Khan wasn't especially evil, probably as fierce as any Steppe warrior, but what he had was brains to unite and conquer. Look at Attila as well.   Also you can look at some serious positive to come from Ghengis Khan's empire (trade, law & order, bringing to worlds closer together, he was an enlightened man, just a different time and place with a different set of values and experiences. Don't get me wrong though, he did some serious fucking shit, but he's too far removed to project on.   Hitler, Stalin, and Pol Pot though, they are evil fucks."
serialkillers,394239,HoChiMiner,5,Wed Jun 10 04:11:21 2015 UTC,"Are you kidding? You must not know much about Genghis Khan! Sure, the body count is higher with more modern methods of killing people, but Khan erased entire cities, destroyed cultures that slighted him, himself raped literally thousands of women. He was a nasty dude.  The argument that the good that comes from the passage of history somehow counterbalances the bad is fallacious - history is history and it would have happened in one way or another if Genghis Khan didn't exist. Death and destruction are death and destruction, it doesn't matter what point in history it is."
serialkillers,394239,trubleshanks,2,Wed Jun 10 13:46:32 2015 UTC,I know a lot about him. What I'm saying is that he is so far removed from today that to project our values on to him is wrong. I've read a shit ton of books on the Mongols and the Franklin Institute just opened up a Ghengis Khan exhibit.
serialkillers,394239,HoChiMiner,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:38:31 2015 UTC,"Ahh the Franklin Institute - I studied anthropological forensics there for summer student study once, in a different life. Love the place.  But back to Kahn, as you are well read in the history of good old Chenggis you must have come across the varying death toll numbers. Personally, I put his death toll at 40 million - I base that on a couple sources, mainly the Chinese census in conjunction with various surviving censuses that shows Eurasia having a population decrease of approximately 37,750,000 following the Mongol conquest.  Many modern historians and others often say that it was impossible for the Mongols to do what they did, that the numbers are exaggerated, that Genghis was a good guy and the mongols are just misunderstood, that we can't trust the numbers.  Personally, it reminds me of holocaust deniers a little bit, but with history it is hard to say sometimes. But I get it, so I took the average from all the death tolls I could find.  An arrow fell from the walls of Nishapur and killed Kahns son-in-law. Kahn allowed his widowed daughter to decide the fate of the city. She decreed death for all and all the heads to be piled into separate pyramids, one for women, one for men, one for children...one for cats, one for dogs. All living creatures.  Another favorite story of Chenggis is the legendary Khwarezm. In the middle of the caravan routes between Persia and China was the cultural center of Islam at the time, Khwarezm. This included the important cities of Bukhara,Merv, Balkh, and others - but the entire region doesn't exist anymore, it has been ground into dust.  Balkh fell first, through surrender. Kahn slaughtered every inhabitant then burnt the city to the ground and erased it from the earth.   Then came Bukhara - to quote Ibn al-Athir    ""a day of horror. there was nothin to be heard but the sobbing of men, women, and children torn apart forever, the mongol troops sharing out the population.The barbarians did violence to the modesty of women under the eyes of their unfortunate menfolk, who in their powerlessness could only weep.""   Next was Gurganj, when it finally fell and the inhabitants slaughtered, a river was diverted to erase it completely. City after city followed with Kahn herding the men women and children in front of his armies to take the direct hit of his enemies arrows.  My point is that Kahn was a brutal warlord. Was he more or less sadistic that anyone at the time? More brutal, in my opinion. I disagree that we shouldn't include people from different eras because we are somehow out of context. This was 700 years ago - not that long, and while ""values"" and the rules of war may have changed, they haven't changed so much that erasing an entire culture is somehow acceptable. If you believe that things like the Geneva convention actually exists in battle, you are wrong. People have the same violent urges as they have always been.  Without a doubt Kahn is up there as one of the worst people in history, don't buy into the modern whitewashing.  Julius Caesar, Alexander, Charlemagne all killed far far less."

I know he did brutal, brutal things. I was just saying that where he lived and when he came up what he did wasn't, ""evil"", you know what I mean? Like projecting our current values of morality on to him doesn't help our understanding of him.   Like shit, if I was a citizen in any of the Chinese kingdoms at the time or any of the Muslim caliphates or Eastern European kingdoms, then Ghengis Khan and the Mongols coming my way would be the absolute scariest and last fucking thing I would want to hear lol.   But yea Caesar and Alexander killed less... But they killed for more or less the same reasons, state/empire building, conquest, instill fear in enemies, and probably some ego boostin lol.   I agree with you 100% on him being a brutal ass dude, but i just think where and when he came up is so alien to how we are, what's evil to us is sometimes everyday livin to them... Sometimes.  Obviously not everything they did can be written off as that.

He cut off parts of the daughter's genitals and laid them on her face, then cut off the mother's breasts and placed them near the daughter, and then, just for fun, he cut off pieces of the mother's genitals and stuffed them in her mouth, after which he posed her suggestively. He did it because he wanted to be the greatest serial killer, and just because he felt like it.  Jack Oscar King abducted a teenage girl named Cheryl Bess who lived at the apartments where he was a handyman and brought her to the desert where he tried to rape her. She resisted, so he poured a gallon bottle of industrial drain cleaner over her face and head and left her for dead. She wandered through the desert, blinded and with her face literally melting off, for hours until she was found.  Lawrence Singleton picked up a 15 year old hitchhiker named Mary Vincent, raped her, cut off her forearms with an axe and left her in a ditch to die. She survived by holding her stumps over her head to stop the blood flow. He continued to taunt and torment Mary and her family for years, threatening to finish the job.

serialkillers,394239,arickp,14,Mon Jun 15 09:25:40 2015 UTC,"Sustaining head injuries or incurring abuse are certainly factors in why people become serial killers most of the time, but you're overlooking the fact that another cause is a severe chemical imbalance. You can look up brain scans for certain serial killers and see the ""hotspots"" of their brain activity, and it is not like you or I's brain activity. Many of them were born that way. Look at Mary Bell.  Also, I think a big part of why people are so afraid of Ted Bundy is because it takes them out of their comfort zone. In America at least, I grew up seeing killers faces plastered all over the television, and as we all know, news outlets like to cherry pick. So you only ever see the crazies, because those are the ones that get headlines. So you are constantly having the idea hammered into your head that that is how killers and psychopathics are supposed to look. Crazy. When Ted Bundy was outed, the country fell silent, because they didn't know what to make of it. A seemingly normal person, with normal, collegiate looks, a good job, a good education, and no history of fucked up shit as a child or adult (on record). It didn't fit into their vision that they were conditioned to believe about killers, and that scared them."
serialkillers,394239,Goodolgator,6,Tue Jun 9 04:24:55 2015 UTC,"Bundy wasn't raised in a loving family home, it just looked that way on the outside.    As a teenager he found out his sister was actually his mother and that his mother was actually his grand mother.   I have also heard rumors that his grandfather was not a kind man and family members suspect that his mother (who he thought was his sister) was raped by her father and the resulting child was Bundy.    While some of this is rumors the fact that his grandparents raised him to believe they were his parents only to learn the truth later is a confirmed fact.    Combine the facts with the rumors and I would be willing to put money on the fact his childhood was not filled with loving family moments.    EDIT:  After a bit of searching its very difficult to find any serial killers who had decent childhoods.  This article lists people like Bundy and Dahmer as growing up in ""loving and supportive households"" but as we all know, Dahmers home life wasn't terrific either.  His mom had severe mental issues, his dad left because of it, and his mom up and left him alone in their house right before he graduated high school.  Practically abandoned her kid, not that she was raising him in any meaningful way to begin with."
serialkillers,394239,Goodolgator,-2,Tue Jun 9 18:29:24 2015 UTC,"Most of the time family sucks, in my opinion. This goes for everyone. Bundy and Dahmer were not outright abused sexually or physically, like many other serial killers were."
serialkillers,394239,bokono,3,Tue Jun 9 19:54:52 2015 UTC,"But if most of the time family sucks, then why are we differentiating between serial killers who did and didn't have family that sucks? If most families suck, that can't really be much of a motivating factor for serial murder or we'd have dystopian, murderous chaos. The problem with trying to create two groups like this is that there is usually a combination of factors that shapes a person into a serial killer or general horrible criminal. The one thing that all serial killers seem to share (excepting those with extremely severe psychosis) is a biological propensity toward violence, lack of empathy, and lack of concern for consequences. Some people have the propensity but don't have it triggered by things like head injuries or childhood abuse. Some do. Some don't need a trigger at all.  That said, I think what you might be looking for is something along the lines of Michael Stone's scale of evil, where he rates various murderers based on a point system. He does use mitigating factors like abuse, mental illness, and lack of premeditation, and he doesn't include political or war-related murderers because of the difficulty in objectively weighing their crimes. I think that is the closest you're going to come to identifying the worst serial killer or murderer, but there are still multiple criminals in each part of the scale."

serialkillers,38wlcj,sherribobbins,2,Sun Jun 7 16:07:26 2015 UTC,"Dispatcher here. It's weird the times I've had people turn themselves in they're usually really composed. I had a person call 911 and say you need to send the sherif  out here because I just shot someone. I asked if they needed an ambulance and he said no, he's dead. I asked him if he was certain and he said yeah I blew his head off. I'm trying to be composed and remember my training I got the address etc from him and told him he needed to put down his weapon before we got there. He then said the weirdest thing. He said ok well I'm going to go drive my vehicle down to the end of the driveway and put the emergency flashers on so you can find the house better.  He did! He sat calmly in his vehicle and didn't resist or anything and guided us to the residence.  When it's someone discovering a victim they're usually hysterical or someone trying to pretend they didn't kill someone they're hysterical but I've had several completely calm people call and report they'd murdered someone but that one was the weirdest call. The thing about sitting in his vehicle at the end of the road so we could find him. The admission of not sending an ambulance because he shot him in the head. Stuff you stay up at night thinking about."
serialkillers,38wlcj,mws85,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:42:46 2015 UTC,I don't think he really was distraught. I think he tried convincing himself he was but also I think he was planning for when he would get caught and was hoping to give off the impression of being remorseful.

serialkillers,38wlcj,Psychopath-,2,Sun Jun 7 22:48:58 2015 UTC,He's always been interesting to me because of how erratic his MO was. He killed by beating and stabbing and drowning. Even very disorganized serial killers usually have one primary method. Some change as they evolve and find whatever satisfies their compulsions most thoroughly (like Bundy going from beating victims to strangling - then back to beating as he devolved in Florida) but Stephani was all over the place. Shame there's not more information available on his psychology.

He got really, really lucky. For example, a few times he intended on killing a target he had been stalking for a while, but when she wasn't there he just picked the house next door. And one killing he walked up to a few houses, knocked on the door and pretended to be the energy guy. Then he used the same ruse on a neighbouring house to kill a lady. He was very impulsive."

If you two were just being homies and he busts out the Norman Bates shit, then yeah its creepy and weird. If there was something possibly more going on, then the ""seduction"" factor combined with the weird shit cranks this thing to like an 11. A dude thinking he found a buddy might reveal some weird shit like that if he thinks ya'll are ""cool.""

I'm gay, he'd been hitting on me for weeks around the neighborhood. I sometimes get horny and curious (especially back then) and exhibit bad judgment.  He wasn't bad looking at all, but mostly I wanted to get high. ""Wanna come over and smoke a joint?"" was his pickup line every time. First couple of times I thought he was too creepy.

Dominique was investigated in late 2006 following a police report by a man who refused to let Dominique tie him up. The final victim, Chris Sutterfield, had died about two months earlier.  Following his arrest on December 1, 2006, Dominique confessed to the rape and murder of at least 23 men over a ten-year period beginning in 1997, in Terrebonne Parish, Lafourche Parish, Iberville Parish and Jefferson Parish in suburban New Orleans.   In his confession, Dominique, who is reportedly gay, said he frequented area gay bars and targeted men he thought would be willing to have sex for money. His reason for murdering these men was to avoid prison. Having raped the men he thought it would be better to kill them than have them report the assault to police. He was charged with multiple cases of rape and first-degree murder.

I overheard a conversation once that stopped me cold. A woman was working as a courtroom artist during his trial. She was there through the whole thing, regularly sketching the judge, prosecution, defenders, and of course, Ted. At one point, several weeks in, she was sketching him. She looked down at her drawing and when she looked up, she said he was glaring at her with such absolute hatred and rage that she froze and her blood actually ran cold. She said ""I didn't believe in evil until that moment. It was written all over his face, and it was terrifying."""

serialkillers,3884a2,BrianW1999,3,Wed Jun 3 00:09:18 2015 UTC,I think he could relate to the people he was talking to on the lines. He probably saw them as underdogs in life and actually did have some empathy towards them. The women he killed on the other hand he was probably saw as attractive stuck up bitches who deserved it and thus there was no empathy. He despised them.  Obviously the predominate motivation was that he was a sexuality deviant as well but I wonder if there is some truth to my statement.   Could be completely off though.

I know he mutilated those two girls, but his motivation definitely stemmed from robbing graves. Although, he was a very tragic man. People for some reason feel bad for Dahmer because they believe he feels remorse for what he did, but I find it very clear that he is a master manipulator; he knew how he was supposed to feel about what he did and played off of that. Gein is the sad one. It aggravates me that he's been made into this sort of ""metal"" icon, with all those movies and songs based on him."

He said he knew what to say to convince the judge he was misguided and remorseful even though it was all for show. There's no reason to believe this suddenly changed after he killed over a dozen people.  Folks like their fictional version of Dahmer. Maybe it's because the shit he did was so fucked up it's easier to believe there's a better explanation for it than ""he wanted to""."

serialkillers,381fp9,antennafarm,64,Mon Jun 1 11:39:35 2015 UTC,"I find any serial killer that uses a gun to be rather monotonous. I'm also so tired with this never-ending obsession with Charles Manson. I like his story and I'm intrigued by his followers, but he is worshiped like he's the top dog among killers and I just do not feel that way in the least. He was not a serial killer (I know there are some murders that were speculated as being done by Manson, but he was never tried for them and consequently it was never proven); he was simply a man who spent the majority of his life in prison which gave him the ability to read people and find the lost souls among a generation."
serialkillers,381fp9,feraltarte,16,Sat Jun 6 22:33:15 2015 UTC,"it seems he's pretty much just a petty criminal that happened to hit big.  one among many - like the bar band that gets a killer record deal but is still just a crappy bar band.  i do like his speaking, though.  true addled."
serialkillers,381fp9,pinkfatticorn,11,Mon Jun 1 08:08:12 2015 UTC,"Agreed. As for his rantings, that's very true. His interviews are really something. Haha. One of my favorite quotes from him is calling Bundy  a ""poopbutt"" and a ""mama's boy"". He doesn't ""roll around with poop people like that."""
serialkillers,381fp9,psycho_watcher,5,Mon Jun 1 08:16:32 2015 UTC,"I'm really not all that interested in his crimes, I just can't help but find some of the weird shit he says entertaining. This is a personal favorite:   When I was young, my window was wide open, and then someone came along and threw a pie in my face, and laughed. Then someone came along and threw another pie, and another, and pretty soon I looked to see them coming, and they all had pies, so I shut my window. I just leave my window shut and forget them, just watch them go by with their pies, and pretty soon I start thinking ‘Well, what’s so bad about getting a pie in the face?’ It’s no fun having your window shut, so I open my window. And next time I get a pie in the face, I just groove on the pie, and it’s good!” -Charles Manson   I definitely mention ""grooving on the pie"" atleast once a month. It's actually not a bad philosophy, but yeah, he's out there. I'm conflicted about finding him so funny, because he's definitely a bad egg."
serialkillers,381fp9,Unibean,12,Mon Jun 1 08:23:17 2015 UTC,"I agree with you totally, and this is my opinion as well. I find guns to be very impersonal and easy. I like researching serial killers because of the way and why they kill. I just think using a guns is a boring way to kill someone, never have liked guns really. Then again I just really dont like guns in most things; I play mostly RPG video games and if there is a gun involved my interest in said game plummets.  I also think the Manson obsession is boring. He is just not all that interesting to me. It might just be because he called Bundy names, no one messes with Ted."
serialkillers,381fp9,ksg1,29,Wed Jun 3 03:41:57 2015 UTC,"I think it would have to be David Berkowitz. He is just a slimy, whiny bag of BS lies. He will go with whatever lie he thinks will get him attention.  As far as his 'conversion, salvation and all that' it is more BS. My friend was locked away with him in NY and says everyone calls him Berzerkowitz. Not because he is insane but because of his crazy BS. His ministry is a joke and David even makes jokes and says that is how they will let him out.   He doesn't apply for parole because he doesn't have to, it is automatic that he comes up. He figures if he plays the good guy and kind of a victim he will get out one day.  I do not find him interesting because he is such a blatant and obvious liar. You know that everything he says is a lie and he does not even posses the personal insight or intelligence to make it interesting or weave truth in it."

serialkillers,381fp9,MadeUpInOhio,11,Mon Jun 1 23:40:36 2015 UTC,The concept of the Smiley Face Killer. At first I thought it was real because someone I was connected with was one of the early people suggested to have been a victim of this killer. And there was a smiley face spray painted on a tree near where he  went in.  But over time it seems like the theory has grown to include all the suicide/accidental drownings in the country. And smiley faces are far from uncommon. There's nothing to the theory.

serialkillers,381fp9,KeepItClassySanDiego,1 point,Mon Jun 1 21:41:34 2015 UTC,I only find Ted Bundy interesting.. because he was able to hide who he was so well. Even after all this time I still can't understand how or why he lived the way he did. What motivated him entirely. A big part of that though is because he hid what he did so well and only gave out limited info about what he did.

He was known for throwing dinner parties and cooking gourmet meals, he was intelligent and friendly according to people who knew him, he also volunteered at a suicide prevention hotline, and worked long nights on the phones trying to preserve other people's lives. Apart from the obvious, he seemed like the kind of person I would want to be friends with, which is terrifying to me."

He was already serving a 12 year sentence for armed robbery then the murder trial began.  His oldest brother was killed in a gang related shooting. Moore had been shot in the face with an AK-47 on the same block and where 2 of the victims lived.  His Mother and girlfriend stand accused of serious crimes including obstructing justice and after the fact.    His brother was murdered apparently over drugs. Another brother shot and killed a drug dealer over you know what but was acquitted. Another brother stole a car and crashed it into a police car and is in prison. Another sibling was shot in the stomach when he was 16.   Mark Moore was shot in the face. He murdered three people he did not know just because.  And one that he did have  beef with. He was in jail for a $500,000 jewelry store armed robbery when arrested.    And he did all of that within 75 days.  Two months of fun and he gave up the rest of his life hopefully.

serialkillers,380w8z,Psychopath-,1 point,Mon Jun 8 11:09:47 2015 UTC,Well when I say I don't rate him it stems from an interview I saw of his where he was talking abort the nature of serial killers and whether they're born that way or are made. Now his theory was purely that it's their environments growing up that shaped them into the killers they become. I don't buy that myself- I think it's a combination of the two and I was pretty surprised to hear someone of his ilk believe that.

The first of the girls that was found in the Scioto River was a suspected suicide, but I think it was either her boyfriend or the human trafficking issue around here. Here's the story for anyone interested  I can assure you that all these girls knew each other, so it's likely drugs or the sex trafficking."

serialkillers,37ufa5,floodimoo123,2,Sun May 31 12:52:54 2015 UTC,As someone not from the US how comes the appalachian areas have such problems with drugs and deprivation compared to the other parts of the states they encompass?
serialkillers,37ufa5,mws85,5,Tue Jun 2 00:04:16 2015 UTC,"It's a lot to do with culture and location. Much of the Appalachian areas are very poor with terrible drug education (well, education period) and located in very woodsy areas. When you're away from town, there isn't much to do unless you go out of your way to go into town, which costs gas using money that not many people have. This leads to boredom, and since drugs have been a problem here for so long, it's a go-to activity which furthers the problem.  Another thing is lack of health care for mental illness and lack of drug rehab areas due to little funding. When people do drugs, many times it's because they're self medicating for depression or anxiety, which is caused mostly (in this area) by A) the stress of being poor, and B) genetic factors. This leads to people popping pills, smoking weed, or even to doing heroin, which is the new fad around here.  Another thing is access. It's just so rampant that pretty much anyone could go to the east and south ends of town, knock on almost anyone's door, and find someone who is a dealer or who knows one. I mean, I live on the end of town that doesn't have as big a problem as the other and I see drug deals go down about every day. Also, since the town is relatively small, everybody knows everybody and knows who to go to for what you want.  When you have so many people that do drugs in one area, you're going to get a poor area. People are poor because they spend money on drugs. People do those drugs because they're either bored because they're poor and can't afford to do things or they're stressed about not having money. When stress or boredom strikes, they spend money on drugs, keeping their stay on the poor area of the social ladder.  They problem here is that it's such a vicious cycle that it's hard to deal with. The situation here is so much more complex than what I described, but that's the best run down I can give. Hope this helps you understand."

Bundy was simply more skilled at blending in, at putting on the right face for the moment. He was also very vested in getting out and getting MORE. The rest, caught, are caught and have no hopes of getting another shot at it. Bundy was intelligent and conceited enough to think he'd get out and get a chance at more violence."

Remember that Kemper killed his grandparents at a very young age way before the other killings so if he did have a condition like this, it would have to have been around for a long time which seems unlikely for something like a tumor."

serialkillers,37abox,Bitchibo,6,Tue May 26 06:00:04 2015 UTC,"Great question! I definitely think it was a conscious, rehearsed act in the case of Ted Bundy. It seems like Kemper's social cues are functioning normally, no ""dead eyes"" or blunted affect. With the others, I'm inclined to think it's pathological and linked to the brain abnormalities we've discovered in serial killers. Imagine how someone who's sustained a brain injury might talk and act. And actually there have been a few serial killers who sustained head injuries prior to the killings, including Ramirez and Ridgway, but that's another subject."

serialkillers,37abox,Unibean,2,Tue May 26 19:20:57 2015 UTC,"Well, really I'd start with What Every Body is Saying. A friend told me you can easily find a .pdf of it by just googling the title and "".pdf,"" although I can't condone copyright theft. Or just get in there and search for the information you want. What I did was read that book and listen to some podcasts from the author on Youtube, then every time I went out I would people-watch and look for the cues I'd studied.  As I went on I just picked up more and more from being curious and googling specific behaviors (the last link up there is perfect for this), kept people-watching, and often watch TV with the sound off. Also seriously, look up Vanessa Van Edwards on Youtube. She's very knowledgeable, informative, and yes, she's even hot.  But if you're looking for an easy way to do it where you can just instantly download all this into your brain, it's just not going to happen. It takes time, effort, and genuine interest. And it is a godsend to the socially awkward."
serialkillers,37abox,Helen_Damnation,2,Tue May 26 21:11:59 2015 UTC,"Wonderful post. I really wanted to know what Ted Bundy was like with his victims. He took them to the woods, and when they started crying and pleading what was he like? How did this charming guy we saw in the video react n what did he say? I always wondered about this."
serialkillers,37abox,heatherattacks,4,Mon Jun 8 17:11:11 2015 UTC,"Actually there may be an answer to this. A former sexual partner claimed that he had pressed his elbow against her throat during sex so she couldn't breathe, and the entire time he seemed entirely zoned out, like he didn't realize that he was doing it. Same thing with Liz Kendall. In her book, The Phantom Prince, she says that when the two of them were on a rafting trip together, he held her head under the water a few times but ultimately let her back up. Every time he did, his face went blank, like he had suddenly gone off into another world.  His court-appointed psychologist, who actually did an AMA a while back, detailed how much work Bundy had put into building a fantasy life for himself as a child that he could dissociate into, slipping back and forth into reality, so much so that the two to him felt completely disconnected. In the fantasy world was the killer, and in reality there was the charming Ted, who went to the electric chair insisting that except for that part of his life, he was a normal guy who actually wanted to help people. I believe that he believed that.  And he did help people. He worked at the crisis hotline, and according to Ann Rule, talked at least one woman out of suicide. He also caught a purse snatcher and saved a child from drowning. He showed compassion for the poor and disenfranchised. As a child, he had fantasies about rescuing women from disasters. I believe the part of him that wanted to do good for people was real, and I think he couldn't quite deal with knowing he wasn't really a good person.  He always felt inadequate. His lawyer claims that he broke down in tears once and sobbed about how he wished he was a good person but knew he wasn't. The lawyer said he'd never seen that out of a psychopath before. He felt inadequate for being born out of wedlock, for being poor, for being picked on. Everything he did socially he did to make himself look and feel like a happy, benevolent success. He wanted to be perfect, and I think the fact that he was a murderer tore him up inside too. He was a very complex person.  Oh, and at least one person saw Bundy screaming at a woman in the passenger seat of his van, so he could become violent and angry. It's hard to imagine, but if you look closely at him, you can see it. He very intentionally cultivated himself to give you the impression that he was harmless."
serialkillers,37abox,heatherattacks,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:32:20 2015 UTC,"Thanks. That was really informative. About his inability to face the reality and the fact that he had killed people, I think that's why he desperately tried to blame it on the pornography. In his last interview, is he really remorseful and convincing himself that it's pornography that gave birth to this violent Ted, or is that one last manipulative trick to make us believe it was not really his fault? Like you mentioned, I think he was really concerned about his image as a charming, perfect guy and he couldn't let that be destroyed and his final interview was one last attempt at charming us all and make us believe he was a good human being, deep inside."
serialkillers,37abox,the-electric-monk,3,Tue Jun 9 08:36:34 2015 UTC,"I believe he was trying to convince both us and himself that pornography was the reason he became a killer. I say this from both a body language standpoint and from what I know about Ted and his life.  In the interview we're talking about, I don't think he believes what he's saying. You can very clearly see him shaking his head in the negative every time he mentions how much of an influence pornography had over him. In fact, he shakes his head in the negative virtually every time he makes a ""yes"" statement. He even sheds a tear near the end, but no grief shows on his face. With grief comes a large amount of lip, eyelid, and center forehead compression, as well as touching and blocking of the eyes or entire face, but he shows none of these things. Ted is lying almost the entire time he's talking in that interview.  However, I don't personally think he is trying to charm us or persuade us into believing that he's not at fault. He has only a few more hours until his execution and would have gained nothing material by lying. You could say he didn't need a reason to do so, since he was a serial killer and habitual liar, but I think there's more to it than that.  Ted may have needed people to believe he was a wholesome, all-American boy and do-gooder, but his fatal flaw was that he also needed to believe it himself. He compartmentalized his evil and characterized it as something outside himself because feeling 100% responsible would tear him apart. This was the man that was desperately ashamed of being illegitimate and poor. In her book, Liz Kendall describes instances where he would show up at her house crying, saying he felt like he was falling apart. He thought she was too good for him and would ask why she was wasting her time in their relationship when there were better men out there. If he was so ashamed of those things, he would also be ashamed of being a killer. Did he feel guilty for what he had done? Not really. But I know he felt like the healthy, wholesome person he wanted to be couldn't also be a murderer.  There was no real Ted Bundy by the end of his life. Maybe there never was. His entire identity was built around what he thought people wanted him to be. He was shy and awkward as a boy, so he started imitating the popular boys to try to feel worthy. He felt like being a killer made him a bad member of society, so he blocked it out.  Ted Bundy was not a good person. He raped and murdered women. He destroyed families, harmed society, and hurt the people who loved him by lying. But I believe that if factors in his childhood had been different, if he had been taught correctly how to interact with people and feel about himself, he may have been able to become something good, and he could have made the world a better place. In my opinion that's an unfortunate thing."

I'm a criminolgy student from Belgium, Dutroux almost always makes its way into any course I've had, it's a shocking and important case that puts it's mark on the history of our policing system and changed things drastically.   One of the reasons the investigation failed on so many levels is that there was a lacking, and even hostile, communication between the three (!!) policing forces we had at the time. There was a lot of competition between these three, which resulted in holding back vital information from eachother, and delayed the investigation a lot.  After this case, the whole system has been reorganised. Right now we have 1 police force on two levels: federal and local. It seems a if Dutroux was the last drop, and forced the politicians to change these systems drastically.   The theory that this case had something to do with the so called 'pink ballets', or 'roze baletten' is an interesting one, and certainly a lot of weird things happened that seem to prove this.  Still I think the lack of communication and the aloof position of the 'Rijkswacht', one of these three forces, was the main reason so much went wrong, they held back vital information for the other police forces which delayed this investigation enormously."
serialkillers,37886q,YsabeauOdd,3,Tue May 26 12:55:26 2015 UTC,"watch this doc. i doubt you'll come away from it thinking this was just a case of bumbling cops competing poorly. there was a story they went into where a top ranking cop searches dutroux's house, and the locksmith hears people talking (the missing children in the dungeon) and the cop ignores it and i believe the same cop seizes videotapes, files them into evidence as something that is not relevant and when another investigator watches the same tape, he finds out that not only does it show footage of dutroux constructing the dungeon, but there is a scene later on in the tape where he is raping a child. cops would compete and would still have motivation to solve the case if there wasnt another conspiracy at play here."

I've been working in my career in the DTES for the past year and a half and was actually volunteering at a central women's shelter there back in feb '02 the day the news of his arrest broke... The regular staff were in tears. Partly from joy that this anonymous monster was finally caught and finally knowing that these women who frequented this particular shelter may have some kind of justice (I'll reserve my personal opinions of the Canadian ""justice"" system for another time, VOMIT)... Partly sorrow from knowing for real that these beautiful, damaged souls would never be seen again. And were butchered like livestock after being abused and raped from any fucking dignity remaining in their terribly difficult lives. This doc on the whole thing was very emotional for me, personally.

Now, knowing how life goes for residents of the DTES, those women were part of a community with real relationships with their neighbours like any other community anywhere. The reports of these women going missing were not taken seriously, since DTES residents or people who are mentally ill and or addicted weren't taken seriously, and written off as nothing important. Absolutely disgusting. Unforgiveable. Imagine if these missing women were all middle class and white...

No.    2) You see a lone female walking at night in a secluded area, what goes through your mind?     I have a pretty specific idea in my head of exactly what steps I would take to follow through on some of my impulses, so someone in that situation wouldn't be in danger from me. I don't think I'd come up on someone and knock them out and drag them away. On the other hand, just the thought of what you could do makes you feel powerful. You're essentially allowing this individual to continue living, and the outcome could easily be different based on something as arbitrary as whether or not you had a bad day.   3) You come across someone stood on the edge of a bridge contemplating suicide, how do you go about the situation?     I don't know. I think I'd try to talk them down, especially with an audience. There's no challenge in pushing someone over the edge who's already there, and I'm really not that big into mind games. It's similar to the reason I have no respect for people who hurt pets and kids - they're cowards who can only feel better about themselves by preying on the defenseless.    4) A bunch of terrorists storm the building and start shooting everyone, do you use the toddler next to you as a meat shield?

It actually helps me to not do anything worse... it relieves some of the pressure and anxiety.

serialkillers,374g6i,Waitwhatdidijustsay,2,Mon May 25 06:29:41 2015 UTC,"I was born into a drug addict family, my mother was a prostitute to feed her meth habit.  After me, two more babies were born. My brothers.   We were taken away by CPS when I turned 5.  Eventually, CPS separated me from my brothers. They were ""long lost"" for a couple years. They were adopted, and I remained in foster care.  The molestation I experienced was awful.  Parents would use food for punishment, so I went to bed without eating pretty often.  There was no family structure, which in my opinion, is vital for a healthy 5 year old mind.  I was molested by the father figure of a foster family I was in for the entire time I lived there. Every single night, I let him abuse me because I was scared stiff. Plus, a couple of the foster boys enjoyed playing show-and-tell with me.  After that, I experienced several forms of neglect and molestation.  One foster mother didn't feed me for a week and banned me to my room because I wouldn't eat dinner one night.  It was shrimp Alfredo. And I didn't like it.  She even put it in a blender and tried to force me to drink, many days after it was fresh and okay to eat.  I was finally adopted at age 8. I had gone through well over 20 foster homes (not including respite) in 3 years. After all the abuse and neglect from foster care, I weighed 47lbs and was very malnourished.  My adoptive parents were very religious.  They were narcissists.  Very verbally abusive.  They took verbal jabs at me 24/7.  That plus teenage angst, I'm surprised I didn't kill anyone honestly.  I'm 20 years old now and very capable of murdering someone.  I have spoken to counselors about everything, very intensively.   But I'm scared that one day I will just wake up, an insane person. The day my brain has a meltdown and I go on a pedo killing spree."

serialkillers,374g6i,Soperos,1 point,Tue May 26 15:35:38 2015 UTC,"There is this line of risk/reward that prevents the sociopath in me from lashing out.  The more I ""normalize"" my life the more risk/loss there is associated with letting go.  I have attachments to people/pets that would suffer should I get caught.  These are the people who make me feel human.  Losing them, at this point, would probably be the thing that would set me off.    And there you have it.  it's probably the cold truth for anyone who feels this somewhere in the back of their head.  It's not could you be.  It's more of a ""what is stopping you"" kind of question.   I've never thought about raping someone.  The thought actually makes me consider killing someone who would do such a thing.  As a sociopath most of my morals are a simple intellectual process of this is ""right"" and this is ""wrong"" but I will admit to some very deep emotional responses when it comes to animal cruelty, cruelty of any kind towards children, and the victimization of women.    Nothing personal in my history to prop that up.  It's simply a matter of me seeing them as innocent and maybe a somewhat tragic wish to be able to feel that kind of innocence.  I also cry whenever someone does something ""heroic"" or makes a heroic sacrifice or mourns after losing someone they love in movies.  I'll never know those emotions.   Oddly that makes me sad."

So in theory, I could possible be a serial killer or at least a serial rapist. I lack human empathy, I'm manipulative and I have a fucked up sexual view.   Although there's basically two things stopping me, the first one is that I actually know it's ""wrong"" although the major thing is that I'm at the same time a paranoid nervous wreck, so I'm super afraid of getting caught. I mean sure, if I had nothing to lose I wouldn't care that much but I do have stuff to lose and I just don't want to face those consequenses because of my impulses.  However, I have earlier stalked girls and have violent sexual fantasies about these girls and other girls as well. I am fully aware that I am a creepy person and I live with that. I've had a girlfriend, who I sexually abused and used to the point where she left me. I would never hurt her of course, but yeah.  As said, I have actually not done anything but in theory it could. Not saying that I'm a ticking bomb, because I have some moral to some extent and the fear of getting caught. But yeah, this is also why I'm interested in true crimes, unsolved murders, serial killers and similar. It thrills me of what could have been.  With those words, I'll continue to be here with you here. Unknownly for you to who I am. Feeling good to have gotten this out of my chest to be honest.  EDIT: I will probably stay on this account for some limited time, in case there's questions. Otherwise I will probably disappear into my ""regular form"" if you so can call it that."

People did not want to believe that this smart, young, good looking, out going young man could be such a monster. Also with a lot of serial killers you can look back a point out what happened in their childhood that made them what they are. Bundy only has 2 major moments people can think of 1. Finding out his sister was actually his mom and he had been lied too 2. Being dumped by his college girlfriend but I don't think that had to do with it.   I also enjoy reading about Dean Corll because his story and ending could easily be a movie. The fact that he had 2 kids working for him and basically selling their friends to him knowing what he is going to do is so god damn evil. It's scary too because we know so little about him or how many people he killed."
serialkillers,36jewj,midnitetoker87,21,Tue May 19 22:30:29 2015 UTC,Bundy's grandfather was an abusive monster. Ted Bundy was literally the only person who had a good word to say about him. Even neighbors reported him torturing animals. Ted lived with him until he was three. There is some evidence his grandfather was also his father. I have no idea why his grandfather often gets so glossed over in biographies about him.
serialkillers,36jewj,Fedelm,8,Wed May 20 02:11:18 2015 UTC,"Mostly because Bundy himself consistently denied the allegations against his grandfather, which I believe are clearly true, and people would rather think pornography or media violence is the answer."

serialkillers,36jewj,AustinCT,2,Wed May 20 02:55:22 2015 UTC,"I doubt Bundy was being manipulating - the interview was probably pre-scripted to give both sides what they wanted:   Dobson interviewed serial killer Ted Bundy on-camera the day before Bundy's execution on January 24, 1989. The interview became controversial because Bundy was given an opportunity to attempt to explain his actions (the rape and murder of 30 young women). Bundy claimed in the interview (in a reversal of his previous stance) that violent pornography played a significant role in molding and crystallizing his fantasies....The Bundy tapes gave Focus on the Family revenues of over $1 million, $600,000 of which it donated to anti-pornography groups and to anti-abortion groups.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Dobson"

serialkillers,36jewj,TheBestVirginia,9,Wed May 20 03:40:49 2015 UTC,"The East Area Rapist/Original Night Stalker. Most people, even people who like reading about crime, have no idea who he is. He raped as many as 50 women through '76 to '79, and is responsible for between 10 and 13 murders.  We didn't know that he was both the East Area Rapist and Original Night Stalker until 2001, when DNA evidence linked the two crime sprees. He ended his killings in 1986, and no one knows who he is to this day. He was never caught.  One of his signatures was a specific knot that he used to bind his victims called a diamond knot. It's a rare knot that none of the police knew how to tie. He would also frequently take food from the victims' refrigerators, and on a few occasions brought a white dog to a crime scene that was missing a toe.  Apparently he was very short and had both a high-pitched voice and a ""conspicuously small"" penis.  Also, he lost the cops a few times when they were chasing him. He threw off a police pursuit on a stolen bike, escaped an FBI agent by vaulting a series of fences, and shot at a cop after feigning surrender, temporarily blinding him while he made his escape.  He got away with 50 rapes, around a dozen murders, and escaped direct police pursuits three times--and no one knows about him. It's unbelievable. For me his case is infinitely more terrifying and shocking than The Zodiac Killer.  As for evidence, there's virtually nothing. Zodiac left more. The physical description we have is almost as vague as Z's. We do, however, have a recording he (allegedly) left on a rape victim's answering machine after the press goaded him to call his old victims. He hisses, ""I'll kill you, I'll kill you,"" until he hangs up. Police also found two pieces of paper that seem to have fallen out of his car when he fled a crime scene. One is a poorly-written paper on General Custer, the other seems to be a journal entry where he describes how angry he was as a child. It's a tantalizing case, and I encourage everyone to read about it."

He either was force to stop or so completely reworked his MO that he continued to operate in a way that is still unknown.  On one show about him, they had an interview with one of his surviving victims, her identity not hidden, and she discussed his small penis.  I wonder if perhaps LE coached her on that, to emphasize that point as a way to draw him out and cause him to slip up.  If so, it was putting her in danger.  Unless they have reason to believe he would be unable to harm her currently (incarcerated, disabled, etc).  Can you link some articles that you find to be the most intriguing about this case?"

Strangulation, which is what a lot of the killers I have read about do, is a very up close and personal way to kill someone. The woman I have read about seem to kill for money or do get a rush from taking life but I don't think it seems like the urge that male killers have."

serialkillers,36juvx,resonanteye,1 point,Tue May 19 23:08:37 2015 UTC,Testosterone has to have something to do with it. With men it's often a sexual thing a power thing or both. Just to be clear I'm talking about how testosterone might affect a violent psychopath not the average man.
serialkillers,36juvx,acertainfailure,1 point,Wed May 20 22:55:44 2015 UTC,Simple statistics make it pretty plain that it'd be more difficult for an average woman to physically overpower an average man.
serialkillers,36juvx,Quellieh,1 point,Tue May 26 07:30:33 2015 UTC,Agreed. It seems female serial killers are more driven by financial gains while male serial killers are motivated by power/dominance. Although it really comes down to a case by case basis.
serialkillers,36juvx,mws85,17,Thu May 21 06:35:29 2015 UTC,Women aren't as likely to succeed in dragging some guy off the pavement and overpowering him. Their 'prey' is limited to those who trust them enough to be alone and well enough to give the opportunity.   Women who have taken part in stranger killings have tended to do so  with a male partner.
serialkillers,36juvx,dethb0y,5,Wed May 20 03:13:24 2015 UTC,Like the top commentor said- I think male serial killers are more compelled by sexual elements. Regarding your question of why female serial killers aren't driven in the same way and yet they also have sexual impulses.... I think (and I'm no expert) that it's because men tend to have more of an innate drive to dominate other human beings even in a non criminal sense of the word whereas women on the whole are possibly more submissive relatively speaking. For instance what I mean is that rape as a crime Is not really a crime of sex at its core but rather a crime driven by the desire to have power over a victim. Obviously sex is a part of it but it's not the overriding drive.   Anyway I could be way off but here but just a theory.
serialkillers,36juvx,torndress,5,Wed May 20 03:16:25 2015 UTC,"I suspect it's just a difference of psychology between men and women, and their psychological motivations and practical limitations. Men tend to go kill for fun, women tend towards killing for practical reasons.   That said, i also suspect that many female serial killers have simply never been caught, and it might be skewing the results somewhat."

serialkillers,36juvx,DAS_LIZARDMAN,1 point,Tue May 26 07:29:07 2015 UTC,"I think it has to do with the socialization differences between men and women. Ted Bundy said that he didn't know a single violent person in prison who wasn't addicted to pornography--men are socialized to sexualize violence, and depending on the person, this may stop at porn, or kink, or it might escalate to murder.  Women on the other hand, are not taught this, they're taught to be passive and submissive. Murder in that case would be less wish-fulfillment and more a means to an end."

They were different individuals on different dates at different locations but otherwise reading about his murders feels like watching the same scene over and over and over with different actors and everything else seeming to be an unavoidable redundancy.

serialkillers,363ka5,dethb0y,1 point,Sat May 16 14:27:10 2015 UTC,"I've always been a bit partial to Carroll Cole and Edmund Kemper (though the latter isn't quite as obscure). Berdella is a good one, though. And don't get me started on how Dennis Nilsen is like a carbon copy of Dahmer (except slightly less fucked up) but no one ever circlejerks about how sympathetic he is.  I feel like people who automatically think of Bundy or Rader or Ridgway and no further when they think of serial killers are missing out.   Edit: My favorite random fact about Robert Berdella is that his homeowners insurance ended up having to pay out millions to the families of the victims after a civil case found that their deaths were unintentional side effects of the methods he used to attempt to control his captives as slaves and the insurance was therefore required to cover them."
serialkillers,363ka5,Psychopath-,-1,Sat May 16 14:37:15 2015 UTC,"Absolutely love Kemper. The guy's the definition of ""worst nightmare"": physically massive, very intelligent, and utterly insane.   Don't forget the patron saint of poorly known serial killers: Dean Corll. Though my theory there is that Dean asks to many questions that there's no good answer for.  Why so many people like Dahmer is a total mystery to me.  I actually got into true crime because of Bernardo and Homolka, and so that's usually where my interest lays - couple's killers, kidnappers, etc. So most of the typical kill-and-dump serial killers are kind of boring to me."
serialkillers,363ka5,ohdoshutupdear,1 point,Sat May 16 14:44:09 2015 UTC,"I like Kemper and Cole specifically because of their level of self-awareness. They understood what they were in a way most psychopaths don't. And both tried to mitigate the damage at some point. I find that interesting.   Corll is another good one. There's one local to me named Daniel Conahan. Randy Kraft. Israel Keyes. Joel Rifkin. Those are all kind of middling in recognition, but still more compelling to me than the ones that have been done to death, so to speak.  Is it just me or does it seem like all the recent serial killers are rather boring? Maybe it's just the fact that there's not currently enough information available to make any of them very compelling.   Also, re: couples killers- Carol Bundy and Doug Clark was a team I always found sort of interesting."

Once-a-decade killers only come around once in a decade, after all.  Probably the two most interesting recent ones are Steven Zelich (who killed two women and put them in suitcases), or that guy Jesse Matthews, who killed Hannah Graham (if it's found he killed other people).  Carol Bundy and Doug Clark were a nasty pair. Sometimes the stars align and two really unpleasant human beings end up together and do awful things that neither one would do on their own."
serialkillers,363ka5,dethb0y,1 point,Sat May 16 15:15:24 2015 UTC,Not insane. I wish this perpetuating myth about serial killers and insanity would go away. Don't get me wrong there's some that definitely were clearly severely mentally ill but their in the minority.
serialkillers,363ka5,mws85,1 point,Sun May 17 00:23:33 2015 UTC,"I would say that anyone who repeatedly kills other human beings for their own ends is, almost by definition, insane. I mean maybe their not irrational, but that's not the behavior of a mentally well person."
serialkillers,363ka5,webpage_down_bot,1 point,Sun May 17 06:07:28 2015 UTC,That's not the definition of insanity though. Psychopathy is not the same as having I don't know- schizophrenia or bipolar or something along those lines. I think people in the latter camp would be offended actually being listed in with people who kill for pleasure.  There's a reason why more often than not insanity pleas get thrown out for those kind of crimes. The person is completely aware of their behaviour and that it's wrong and yet they carry on with it.

serialkillers,363g6w,midnitetoker87,30,Fri May 15 19:54:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'd play it. Frankly I'm more put off by video games where you kill thousands of people and get called a hero for it. That's not how slaughter usually works. I prefer games where you're a morally ambiguous antihero, if not an outright villain. Bad guys have more fun anyway. If Blue Velvet were a game I'd choose to play as Dennis Hopper over Kyle Maclachlan ten times out of ten. Playing as Hannibal would be way more fun than Will Graham.   Also, serial killers can be really compelling characters with good stories (the fictional ones mostly). To get away with it you've got to be smart and resourceful. There could be a great game in that if a AAA studio had the balls to make it.  I abhor violence in real life. I'm against the death penalty in all cases. But I love violent movies, books and games. They're cathartic and a great way to unwind at the end of the day. The first two mediums are free to explore themes that games still aren't. It's a young medium and has some catching up to do."

Arguably the ""hitman"" game series is about a serial killer of a sort, and would feature the kind of gameplay most people would find objectionable.

I told her I would not want to sell it to anyone under the age of 17 like the label recommends.   When Manhunt 2 came out, I was working at Best Buy and went through the same thing.

serialkillers,35ypuo,cyanzen21,48,Thu May 14 17:00:41 2015 UTC,"It's just you.  Or, based on the comments below, it's more accurate to say it's feeling but not a fact.  I've seen reports of three alleged serial killers captured in the US in the past year: William Devin Howell in Connecticut, Jesse Matthew in Virginia, and Darren Vann in Indiana.  This is in addition to the various ones who are known to exist but haven't been caught, such as the Long Island/Gilgo Beach Killer, those we haven't detected yet, and any who are inactive but at large.  Believe me, there are plenty of serial killers to go around.    There's a lot of reasons why they're less prominent now.  For one thing, police are significantly better at catching them, so the kill counts don't get as extremely large as Ridgway's or Bundy's - even Israel Keyes, who was really good at getting away with murder, is thought to have only hit 8-12 people.  Media and police aren't publishing letters from killers like they did with Zodiac, Berkowitz, or Rader.  The kind of criminal case the media prefers to focus on now skews towards mass murderers (Lanza, Tsarnaev) or pretty girls Nancy Grace hates (Amanda Knox, Casey Anthony), possibly because most serial killers in reality are significantly less interesting than the ones that we've been seeing in fiction the last few decades (Dexter, Hannibal).    Even in the time period you were talking about, a very small number of people grab the vast majority of the attention; hardly anyone who isn't a hobbyist knows who Randy Kraft, Bob Berdella, Wayne Willians, Danny Rolling, Rodney Alcala, or Daisy Dorothy Puente are if they don't have a personal connection to the crime.  Dahmer was a cannibal, which always scores attention, and gay just as that population was starting to become more visible in the US.  Gacy was a clown.  Bundy escaped, twice, and had a spree in a sorority house when he should have been standing trial.  Zodiac had a cool mask and a secret code, and was published in the San Francisco papers.  Son of Sam hit the nerve center of East Coast culture and had a wacky legal defense.  Manson killed famous people and hung out with the Beach Boys.  Gein, Wuornos, Zodiac, and Jack the Ripper all had movies made about them.  BTK got caught decades after his first murder because he didn't know how those newfangled computers worked.  We haven't had one of those attention-grabbing killers in a while - I had to google two of the three recent killers' names above because they're so forgettable - but don't mistake that for not having serial killers at all.  Manson gets thrown in with serial killers because he interests a lot of the same people, but in terms of why he appeals to media coverage, he's much more like other cult leaders, which we genuinely haven't had in the news as much lately.  You should compare Charlie to Jim Jones and David Koresh, not Dahmer.  The last cult case I recall hearing about was something along the lines of child services raiding a fringe Mormon group.  It's just didn't nab the headlines without Janet Reno there to light something on fire, though."
serialkillers,35ypuo,CarmenEtTerror,8,Thu May 14 19:24:18 2015 UTC,"Really good write up and you make a lot of sense. One thing though... its Dorothy Puentes, or 'Dot' as her 'friends' would call her .... I think the Manson observation particularly astute. He does belong more with the likes of Jones-Koresh, than Dahmer. The F.B.I Behavioural Unit have said that Manson is the type of guy they would hire as a profiler given his talent for 'reading' people. A complete natural is what J.Douglas stated."

His victim count was five, in Gainesville, two out of necessity (neutralize the biggest threat, another male) and he was actually apprehended fairly quickly. And this was 1990. Much was kept out of the papers, students were withdrawing from school...but after he was apprehended, turns out he was just a loser, drifter, uninteresting guy. But the impact he made still lives today, as seen by the maintenance of the memorial wall of the victims. (He eventually confessed to eight murders.) He seems to be relatively unknown, except to those who lived through it, lived nearby, or read about him in Florida papers.   Recent article"
serialkillers,35ypuo,GargoyleOnTheRoof,2,Mon May 18 11:36:30 2015 UTC,"I lived near/worked in Gainesville then and it was a totally bizarre time. Gun sales went through the roof, which was terrifying in itself, and the media totally shredded the first suspect who was just a crazy kid. Rumors were rampant and crazy as hell but it was surprising how many were confirmed in court later. Imo, the most terrifying murder was Hoyt, the third one. It was clear at that point there was a SK in town and he just destroyed her. And she worked for the sheriff's office which sent the media down rabbit holes of their own digging. It made a deep scar on Gainesville but it has faded over time.

serialkillers,35ypuo,trubleshanks,8,Sun May 17 20:46:03 2015 UTC,"I think it might be because were able to look back and reflect with a whole different perspective than the people living in the present when it all happened, like it might seem like one big cluster of serial killers around the same time period but it's really spanned throughout 30-40 years. In the next 30 years it's likely that there will be killers active during the 00s 10s 20s and 30s that will become notorious like those guys, we just don't know it yet. One thing I love about history is you can learn the events leading up to something, that actual something happening and the consequences it has, we can't really do that with freshly caught killers so that gives guys like bundy dahmer ect time for their legacy, notoriety, and history to build up I don't know if this even makes sense I'm just writing random thoughts. Also with the advancement of police resources they will probably be able to find patterns and catch someone quicker than they could back then, or the killers are learning from past killers mistakes and getting smarter"
serialkillers,35ypuo,Langord,2,Thu May 14 17:30:12 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  Can anyone here imagine how hard, and exhausting it would be to get away with multiple murders in this day and age??  Cameras everywhere, all the technological forensic advances.  We in modern society leaving traces of ourselves everywhere.  I want to think that these killers are getting smarter, but really, other than the very few, like Bundy, H. H. Holmes, Zodiac perhaps, none of them have been all that smart to begin with.  But looking back at the interviews, tapes, film clips and videos of someone like Bundy, it's hard not to believe that he really was the devil incarnate. Enough to scare the hell out of a person that a person like Bundy actually existed, and that there are others out there just like him."
serialkillers,35ypuo,JohnFell,2,Thu May 14 17:58:04 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I thought at first that these serial killers weren't as common because of our original fears as well as new technological advances in criminology.

serialkillers,35ypuo,JoBoSoMo,2,Thu May 14 18:04:20 2015 UTC,Or there's nothing 'shocking' about their crimes? Too much gore and killings in our media and history has desensitised us as a society? When they do get reported it's often not in the papers for long is it?  Maybe they're not as media appealing as terrorists are atm??
serialkillers,35ypuo,JumpingBean12,2,Thu May 14 21:02:20 2015 UTC,History tends to repeat itself.  There have been serial killers throughout the centuries and there will always be those who kill multiple individuals...
serialkillers,35ypuo,abanks47,7,Mon May 18 22:32:05 2015 UTC,"I agree with all comments but another theory, in one instance, not sure if there are others, the authorities simply didn't report it.

Bundy, Dahmer and Gacy snatched people who were missed a little more. Not saying one life is worth more than another but that's just how the world goes. Also some of the well known serial killers were very gory or did a lot more deviant acts with the bodies. Someone that strangles 5 hookers and dumps their bodies somewhere doesn't get headlines like a ""26 bodies found in 1 house"" would."
serialkillers,35ypuo,JumpingBean12,2,Thu May 14 17:49:09 2015 UTC,Plus prostitutes often move on so they are not missed...

serialkillers,35ypuo,midnitetoker87,3,Thu May 14 21:20:58 2015 UTC,"They have but I'm saying the big ones/well known like Bundy, Gacy, Kemper, Son of Sam, Corll, BTK, Zodiac, Ramirez and Dahmer all killed innocent people that were not prostitutes.   Really the only reason Ridgway is known is because of his high victim count. He is not really known of among people who do not read about serial killers"
serialkillers,35ypuo,Flyonz,3,Thu May 14 21:32:31 2015 UTC,"Ahhh man, I dunno Midnitetoker?? See, here's my thought, and it just struck me. Here goes... For a person to find oneself in a position of murderous gratification, willing to go through with the whole shebang, I'm guessing you wanna be comfortable in the knowledge that you wont get captured by the police/public. Soooo, ya gonna stick to what you know works, right? Taking the guys you noted above: Bundy was glib, a total chameleon. Narcissistic necrophiliac, he hid he dark side SO WELL, I wouldn't be surprised if he actually believed he was innocent? Gacy employed kids, n killed them. In his own house (Thats comfort,no?)!! Kemper's mother worked on college campus plus he hung out with cops that were investigating his murders. What I'm saying is: Killers are comfortable with prostitutes because if your not a burglar like Ramirez. A spoilt brat with a boatyard like Corll. Or you fit the actual security system that's meant to keep you out, like Dennis Rader... then you might just get lucky?? Ending up being able to murder at will like Lonnie Franklin, because your 'only killing girls who sell sex anyway?' ... It's what they deserve, right? Not..."
serialkillers,35ypuo,midnitetoker87,2,Thu May 14 23:51:04 2015 UTC,I agree with what your saying big time. I guess my thought was directed towards what the original question op asked which was why we don't hear about serial killers as much as we did in the 80's and on. I was just saying that the media doesn't cover them as much because people don't care about a guy that kills prostitutes because that isn't as scary as a guy snatching just you average person. Most people can only name the people we mentioned earlier mainly because they effected how we feel around strangers and trusting someone you meet at the bar. Rarely do people hitch hike anymore but that use to be a way people got around in the 70s or 80's. If I asked my family or friends who the grim sleeper was? They wouldn't know because he doesn't seem dangerous because most people won't ever be in the position to get into someone's car for money.
serialkillers,35ypuo,JoBoSoMo,1 point,Fri May 15 01:00:21 2015 UTC,"I agree with the fact that certain people don't get reported as much.  But...same with the era debate...what happened to those killers that cannibalized, decapitated, severely mutilated their victims, or even worse hid them in their own house. Is is modern technology? Is is a societal change?..idk that's what I'd like to hear from everyone."
serialkillers,35ypuo,midnitetoker87,3,Thu May 14 18:08:07 2015 UTC,"I think that this still occurs on a scale that is unknown because of poor countries, cities etc that don't have as much police enforcement, cameras, gps tracking (smart phones) etc that built up western societies. I once read that serial killers- those with a real passion and desire to kill- are now being more frequently found in African countries or places like Mexico because high crime is expected, people disappear often and lots of desert/ arid land to hide bodies (plus wildlife that'll eat every trace)... So they can get away with more and not be detected (like men going to Thailand for child sex)?? How true that all is is unknown, I just read someone's theory and thought it might make sense. I would be interested in hearing others thoughts?"
serialkillers,35ypuo,dan-paralanguage,2,Thu May 14 20:59:31 2015 UTC,It could that society has learned from the past. Bundy was able to get women to go off with him alone or Dahmer got people to come to his apartment to party alone or a lot of victims were hitching rides. People are less likely to do this without letting someone know where they are going. Cell phones make it easier for us to keep in contact with eachother.
serialkillers,35ypuo,mws85,3,Thu May 14 18:29:13 2015 UTC,murder rates have gone down pretty significantly over the past 40 plus years. check out this http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/murder-rates-nationally-and-state scroll to the bottom for the national 1970 to 2013 murder rates. also of interest is this http://www.epa.gov/airtrends/aqtrends.html it shows lead levels diminishing significantly from 1980 (i believe that was the highest murder rate year) to today.
serialkillers,35ypuo,Surfacetovolume,2,Fri May 15 04:57:49 2015 UTC,The main reasons why I'd imagine there's not as many or at least doesn't seem to be is like one of the other posters said- with the advancements in DNA testing and technology generally it would be a lot harder to get away with killing multiple people. The invention of camera phones has probably also made it more difficult because it's very likely that even acting a tiny bit suspicious in this day even if totally innocent will likely get you snapped and then there's the Internet and mass communication with people from all over the world which people can share experiences of a creepy encounter.  Finally I imagine the news outlets don't give serial killers the same media coverage- partly because they're not as interested but secondly because they don't want to give these people their 15 minutes of fame which some crave and so on.
serialkillers,35ypuo,torndress,2,Fri May 15 13:43:22 2015 UTC,One factor might be they are considered as novel or newsworthy as 30+ years ago.
serialkillers,35ypuo,kookydad,2,Fri May 15 13:56:33 2015 UTC,"This is something a lot of people wonder because you’re right, looking back in time you see…dare I say, distinguished names? Maybe recognizable is a better word. But when you turn on the television, you’re saturated with crime dramas that more or less draw from police investigation techniques, documentaries on serial killers, psychology, forensics, yadda yadda, so these things are made readily available to an astronomical number of people all over the world. My opinion is that these SKs are just simply getting better from the information that’s provided on television. The internet helps too. Chat rooms, craigslist, backpages, other media sites that can connect you with someone almost immediately gives a potential predator a massive catalog from which to choose from. But because of this, I believe “modern” killers are also getting more personal with their victims. They don’t have to go out and stalk the streets anymore, they can open a laptop or hop on a public computer to browse their specific type. TV and internet more or less act an easy library for information on what not to do too. If you spend enough time perusing through this information you can gather a general idea of what’s hard to expose, how to change your tactic and MO to stay at large longer, look at who evaded detection in the past the longest by moving around, etc.   On the flip side, you’re also looking at a time now when minor offenses could land you in prison for a really long time. We have a fairly large incarceration rate here in the US so slight infractions could put you away longer now than say the 60s-80s. So someone who commits crimes in their late teens to early 20s gets out when he/she’s in their mid-30s to early 40s. Studies show aggression and various characteristics that would otherwise satisfy an archetypal SK profile drop significantly with age."

serialkillers,35mhu6,nightmaredressdream,40,Mon May 11 18:45:55 2015 UTC,"Okay guys. I was the managing editor of Crime Library for 3 years, up until close to the time that it was shut down. I'm sorry that I didn't make some kind of announcement that it was going to happen.   Basically /u/mdcastle is right. As its brand strategy veered farther and farther away from true crime, TruTV continuously reduced support and funding for CL. Also, over time, the main advocates for CL (who were mostly Court TV holdovers and into the crime stuff) were either laid off or quit. There has been a lot of turnover at TruTV over the years, and as new people took power, Crime Library was far from their highest priority.   The site didn't jive with the network's brand strategy, and even after all the TruTV branding was removed from it, they were still uncomfortable with having this gore-fest of a website under their brand umbrella.   Additionally, the website went through a lot of redesigns, half-baked republishing efforts and changed hands a number of times, which meant that structurally, it was an absolute mess. Literally two people in the world (myself and one other person) knew how to navigate this hoarder's attic of a website. There was no one at the network who wanted to touch it. In case of a threat of lawsuit --- which happens fairly often when you're posting mugshots and arrest stories -- nobody would even know where to find the offending content.   On a more editorial note, Crime Library really began to suffer during the rise of clickbait, HuffPo, Buzzfeed, etc. We felt pressured to spend more time and resources on one-off funny arrests and zippy news bites with links to other sites, rather than long, well-researched content.  All that said, it was a great ride. And although we never had the audience of the bigger, prettier websites, we had a dedicated audience of crime buffs (or murder nerds, as I've been called.) And, as everything on the internet -- Crime Library lives on in spirit. All the content can be found on the Wayback Machine.   http://web.archive.org/web/*/crimelibrary.com"
serialkillers,35mhu6,stacyhatesmacys,9,Tue May 12 01:48:37 2015 UTC,"I used to spend so much time on Crime Library back in the day, and as I recall, the stories always provided very thorough and comprehensive accounts, and had a lot of obscure/interesting tidbits.   I'm sad that the website's down, but I appreciate all the work you've put into it. Things change, unfortunately, and the climate of the internet right now and the general shift towards clickbait is really heartbreaking."

It's funny too that (even though many people now doubt him as a suspect) the letters I've seen from Arthur Leigh Allen have that same tendency, to misspell for humor or effect. He would say they were written on a ""Satiddy"", and sign them ""Beeg Al""."

So a lot of circumstancial evidence, but he did get arrested. Died of a heart attack before he was convicted"

serialkillers,35kajg,potlel,2,Tue May 12 06:30:57 2015 UTC,"Thats not true. Arthur Leigh Allen is not the Zodiac.  Law enforcement looked into him and conceded that there was a lot of circumstantial evidence but nothing could tie him to the case.  His fingerprints didn't match the bloody one found in Paul Stines cab, his dna wasn't found on any licked stamps (someone later accused him in 2002 of licking stamps for ALA but thats likely made up), his palm print didn't match the one found on the Zodiacs letters.  Robert Graysmith intentionally tried to paint ALA as the Zodiac and because his book sold the most thats what most people believe, he made up facts and presented things in such a way that was biased."

serialkillers,35kajg,IAMYOURSTEPFATHER,3,Mon May 11 13:57:50 2015 UTC,"Not sure if it has any bearing on his intelligence, but the BTK (like Zodiac) also had trouble with spelling/grammar. Read his journals -- they're practically indecipherable they're so riddled with spelling and grammar errors. It's completely unhinged, the way he writes.   I read John Douglas's book about BTK and from what I remember, Radar's gibberish writing style was so unique, that even his wife noticed the similarities with BTK's letters."

He got caught in a silly way to us but his generation isn't particularly computer savvy and I think it also underestimates the rapport the police had worked to build with him.  Just because someone is smart doesn't mean that they can't be naive.  I'm not saying he was smart and it's not like I idolize the guy but I'm not sure if I'd dismiss him as an idiot just because he got caught in in a way that makes him look dumb.

Crime researchers acknowledge that it is not linked with later sociopathic behavior. It is not even clear that it is necessarily associated with distress.  However, some authors continue to speculate that enuresis may be related to firesetting and animal cruelty in some way. One argument is that because persistent bed-wetting beyond the age of five can be humiliating for a child, especially if he or she is belittled by a parental figure or other adult as a result, this could cause the child to use firesetting or cruelty to animals as an outlet for his or her frustration. Enuresis is an ""unconscious, involuntary, and nonviolent act and therefore linking it to violent crime is more problematic than doing so with animal cruelty or firesetting"".   Source."

I don't know that it was Allen –– for instance, any attempt to say he looks like the composites always seems pathetic to me –– but I have to say I've always loved the results of this 1991 search by VPD of his home, where they seized his hilariously large arsenal and bomb-making supplies. Regardless of whether he was Zodiac or not, I always recommend reading Zodiac Unmasked just to see what a truly bizarre character Allen was."

Especially with older samples, they're likely to be more primitive and sometimes won't even give a good sample."
serialkillers,35a4k5,tonuorak,1 point,Sat May 9 11:15:56 2015 UTC,"Your question and mine. In the -teen years of researching Zodiac, I have gradually eliminated all the popular suspects from the list, for a variety of reasons, yet Kane is the one who has always remained on my little list.  While I am more inclined towards an unsub as Zodiac, ignoring Kane (typically done out of jealousy towards Harvey Hines) is a stunning mistake, bordering on almost criminal negligence, and as far as I can tell, his DNA has indeed never been tested against Zodiac's.  Definitely worth a look: https://welshchappie.wordpress.com/"
serialkillers,35a4k5,BurtGummer1911,0,Fri May 8 16:27:58 2015 UTC,"The partial DNA profile that they have doesn't have enough genetic markers to include any suspect, but when compared against a known donor, can exclude him from the suspect sample. You can only prove someone is not the Zodiac, but not that someone is, so its probably pretty much useless to the LE without other supporting evidence. And I don't think there's much evidence (even circumstantial) to link Kane to the Zodiac crimes."

For what it's worth, most serial killers are not mentally ill in terms of being in control of what they are doing (i.e. they are not out of control) Whitman is an example of someone not being in control due to a medical condition.

Rader: Drove home and just as soon as I got started turn down, it was Frontage Road, I saw this whole line of police cars up.  That’s not good.  And —they were right on me.  Just that quick.  I thought maybe it was a traffic stop or something.  But as soon as one of ‘em’s behind me with the red lights and sirens, I knew that was it.  With that, Dennis Lynn Rader, the man believed to be BTK, was finally in custody after 31 years.  Rader: They arrested me, yep.  They got out of the car.  They pulled guns on me.  Told me to lay down.  And I sprawled out and they grabbed me real quick like in handcuffs and stuck me in a car.  ""Mr. Rader, do you know why you’re going downtown?""  And I said, “Oh, I have suspicions why.” At first it was kind of—kind of a cat and mouse game.  That they had a suspect.  But it, but it, but it did kind of hurt, you know.

Dennis Nilsen requested that he not be handcuffed and arrested in front of his dog, Blue, so she wouldn't get upset.  Not quite an answer to the original question but: Carroll Cole had been let go for murder previously after strangling his wife. Law enforcement found her wrapped in a blanket and stuffed in a closet but they came to the conclusion she died due to her heavy drinking and they released Cole without charge after questioning. A year later, he strangled three more women. He was suspected in the second murder and taken into police custody after being found at the scene of the third. The police came to the conclusion that the third victim had died of natural causes. As they prepared to release Cole, he began confessing: to those murders, to killing his wife, and to ten others. He was eventually executed."

serialkillers,34wjmk,BlackWidowOffer,12,Tue May 5 03:35:30 2015 UTC,"Forgiveness is powerful even if you don't have empathy. To some degree, Ridgway was probably hurt by the shame and hatred thrown his way, even if he didn't have empathy for the victims. After taking all that abuse, he would've been grateful for forgiveness and acceptance. No wonder he had an outburst of emotion.  This is just a guess. For all I know, those were crocodile tears.  As for Ridgway, he was a complicated guy. He was of below average intelligence, and his parents shamed him for repeatedly wetting the bed all the way up to the age of 14. He was Vietnam veteran who saw combat. He was extremely religious, but also addicted to sex. In a lot of ways, it seems like he was just the product of some nasty experiences.  Supposedly, his kill-rate went down while he was married. Apparently it was a real, loving relationship. His wife even said, ""I feel I have saved lives ... by being his wife and making him happy.""  That said, there is a horrific quote by Ridgway, about picking up prostitutes: ""I would talk to her... and get her mind off of the, sex, anything she was nervous about. And think, you know, she thinks, 'Oh, this guy cares'... which I didn't. I just want to, uh, get her in the vehicle and eventually kill her.""  I don't think Ridgway had empathy. I think he was seriously mentally ill and emotional, as well as a good liar, but in that mess that was his head there just wasn't any compassion."
serialkillers,34wjmk,IsThatJesus,8,Tue May 5 05:44:52 2015 UTC,"When you're driving and someone does something extraordinarily stupid like almost hit your car because they're texting, you wouldn't feel much empathy for the person. If you saw them in a different context like on the local news trying to get a wish fulfilled for their dying child, you would probably empathize with them. When Ridgeway was looking to get his rocks off by strangling and raping someone he didn't empathize with them, but seeing their families crying in court got to him.   Not to say he wouldn't go out and start killing again, I'm sure he would."
serialkillers,34wjmk,Ranndym,2,Tue May 5 05:38:07 2015 UTC,I think here there could be an element of him not realising how what he was doing would impact on a grander scale and maybe the pardon in court brought it home.  Edit: autocorrect decided to put Yo at the start of the paragraph.
serialkillers,34wjmk,Rimbo90,7,Thu May 7 12:22:03 2015 UTC,Recent research suggests that sociopaths and psychopaths are not incapable of empathy but have the ability to regulate the feeling.

serialkillers,34wjmk,bokono,1 point,Tue May 5 05:00:41 2015 UTC,So he wanted to experience empathy?
serialkillers,34wjmk,bokono,3,Tue May 5 05:18:19 2015 UTC,"Well, I don't know enough about it to say one way or another. A Google search would likely yield some of the results that your looking for.   From what I understand, it would seem that he allowed (most likely unconsciously) those feelings to occur for one reason or another. Iirc this was after he had been in prison for a little while. Maybe his own selfish suffering made him more sensitive to the woes of others. It's hard to say. Ridgeway was an odd specimen because no one would have ever suspected him. Even the people who investigated and prosecuted him were surprised by how ""normal""  he seemed. Obviously from looking at his crimes, he lacked the basic empathy that most people are equipped with. But I wouldn't rule it so that some of these ""psycho killers"" are able to empathize with others. They just don't care. Nothing is more important than their own personal agendas."
serialkillers,34wjmk,DrStephenPenisPhD,4,Tue May 5 05:34:15 2015 UTC,"Psychopath and socio-path are outdated terms, but yes, Gary Ridgway definitely has (he's still alive btw) what is now termed anti-social personality disorder. All the terms are a little bit in dispute, but I think we all know what you're getting at with the question. The ability to cry does not undermine his entire psychological state and behavioural history. It would be like claiming someone wasn't depressed because you saw them laugh once. 'Does he have a conscience?' is, I believe, a philosophical question at this point, but realistically, in the workable, real life sense of the question, no. You can't murder 70+ people and have what we define as a conscience."
serialkillers,34wjmk,kluxy,1 point,Wed May 6 22:49:23 2015 UTC,"I find it a specious argument to say 'psychopaths don't experience empathy'. Emotion in itself is so deeply hardwired in our brain I can't begin to conceive of a human being (let alone even a single-celled organism) that doesn't 'feel' either aversion or inclination.  This is the literal distinction that organisms (as opposed to non-living organisms) have adapated to survive.  And it's these core emotional states that higher order levels like empathy and sympathy are grounded upon, and through which we learn to have a 'conscience'.    The distinction comes about through what we learn to accept or reject as moral ethos.  Consider for one second war time, and how easily someone can actually be convinced (by social forces) to reject a human's life.  Gary in this case was even a war vet and subscribed to that very same notion as an occupation.  That's not to say that every single serial killer was a veteran, but the distinction I want to illustrate is that at some point in their lifetime they too were pitted with the moral dilemma and rejected it, and that in itself is the sign of having a conscience.    In the same way that you would reject feeling bad about budging in line for your morning starbucks coffee, because your personal gain outweighs someone else's time.  These people's personal gain can outweigh someone's life."
serialkillers,34wjmk,bokono,2,Tue May 5 07:17:18 2015 UTC,It's been shown with recent research that sociopaths and psychopaths are capable of empathy. They just have more control over those feelings than others.

serialkillers,34wjmk,kluxy,1 point,Wed May 6 21:27:13 2015 UTC,"I agree with yours (and the academics') sentiment that these traits are often borne out of inappropriate childhood experiences, but how does that call into question the fact that the individual themselves was still at one time posed with the moral dilemma?  They could be 5 years old, or they could be 45 years old, there is no difference when asking the moral question.    Granted we could call into question theories of emotional development of a child, but I still firmly believe even a child can 'feel' the requisite emotions, despite not being able to describe them intelligibly."
serialkillers,34wjmk,CuomoDuffy,0,Thu May 7 01:12:14 2015 UTC,"A child can most certainly experience emotion, but it's the ""emotional damage"" experienced in early childhood that numbs the ability to emphatize later in life. To my knowledge the dilemma is non-existent because the disinclination to consider the needs and emotions of others has become completely ingrained and habitual. I have met several psychopaths, they clearly make calculations, but not of a moral kind. They see to it that they get the most out of any exchange, their fellow human beings be damned."

Thing is, the average person would have a switch go on where enough is enough, not so with a psychopathic mind. Mix that with a sexual/social or emotional hangup and the most obscene scenarios can ensue. Where one would stop, this is not gonna happen.  I would agree that a psychopath could look back n say ''gee, I went too far there?''. But as for actually 'feeling' bad about having caused another's suffering/ death, no. Which is why a guy like Ridgeway could commit his acts over and over. He did tear up when a victims father forgave him in open court, but I think he was mimicking how a person would generally act in that circumstance, because he's a psychopath and mimicking actions of feeling is a psychopathic trait."

serialkillers,34vhoz,Psychopath-,2,Tue May 5 00:08:01 2015 UTC,I agree with you about Dahmer but there's no way Chase or Mullin were anything but totally batshit. Research shows juries don't like finding even obviously mentally-ill murderers not guilty by reason of insanity- especially multiple killers- because it brings with it the possibility of future release in a way that death or ten consecutive life sentences don't.

serialkillers,34vhoz,bokono,3,Tue May 5 07:09:16 2015 UTC,"Yes psychosis is a break from reality. Psychopathy is a behavioral disorder. It's mostly characterized by a lack of empathy and the apathy of the inevitable consequences of one's actions. There's more to it than that, but those are good quick examples.   Edit: there are great Wikipedia articles on a lot of psychiatric disorders. For instance, Jeffrey Dahmer suffered from BPD and that article is extensive."
serialkillers,34vhoz,Psychopath-,14,Tue May 5 07:13:21 2015 UTC,"Dahmer was not crazy. He was absolutely a psychopath. People want to romanticize Dahmer's crimes because he put on this meek and timid act that makes people think he was really just sad and misguided. He may have been those things too but ultimately Dahmer was a psychopath who saw other people as non-autonomous objects there to fulfill his own needs. Maybe it's because his desires are more often explained in terms of wanting companionship, longing for a connection, ending his loneliness- things the average person can relate to more than the serial killer's psychological norm of simple sexual conquest, but the end result is the same. There are a lot of desperately lonely people who manage to restrain themselves from killing and eating parts of almost 20 people. Jeffrey Dahmer drugged and kidnapped young men and drilled holes through their skulls so he could inject acid into their brains because he wanted fully-controllable but living sex slaves. He didn't really want companionship- that presumes agency on behalf of the desired partner to actually engage in all aspects of the relationship. He wanted the exact opposite of companionship- he wanted sex without any of the pesky things you have to work at as one half of a successful relationship instead of as a slavemaster. And when his victims died, he raped them and then he cut them open and masturbated again and again while digging through their entrails and he did it for as long as possible before they went bad. Then he cut them into pieces and sometimes he stored some parts and sometimes he ate some parts and sometimes he cut off their heads and dissolved the skin with acid and painted the skulls. You could argue he's not a sadist and in pure intent that might be true but in action- he drilled holes in their skulls and injected their brains with acid in the hope that they would survive it to be a living, breathing shell of a human being that could be raped at Dahmer's leisure.  If Dahmer wasn't a psychopath, we need to redefine the term."

If the only definition is ""Killed multiple people with malice""  All soldiers who have more than one kill fit the bill and will tank your percentage. Theres plenty of people who have killed multiple people and deeply regret it, as well as people who have killed multiple times for other reasons.  If you're talking strictly about people who have killed in a fetishist way, then yes of course, its a pretty stupid question at that point."

My auntie refused and kept walking, but the woman was very insistent. In the end, my auntie ran away down a back street.

Secondly, my grandmother was a long time patient of Dr Harold Shipman. When he was arrested, she was in absolute disbelief, she had always found him to be a kind, compassionate doctor who seemed to really care about his patients. Worryingly, they mentioned in news coverage that after killing, he would become very withdrawn and cold, my grandmother remembers going to see him once after he'd been on a house call and finding him in a foul mood when she went into the office, she thinks he had just arrived back from killing somebody.

serialkillers,34ojwe,LittleHelperRobot,12,Sun May 3 16:21:50 2015 UTC,"Kendall Francois (http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendall_Francois) was my fiancé's middle school hall monitor. It only affects my life because I think it plays a role in the fact that he hates it when I have to go to Poughkeepsie for any reason. My town is 2 towns over from there and it's the closest thing to an urban area we have in this county. Honestly, it's far from dangerous but one serial killer had to go and screw up people's opinions of the place. Francois is long dead and only targeted prostitutes so I have no clue why his expired existence would cause me to be in danger but my fiancé is a worrier.   On a side note, Kendall Francois died in prison at the young age of 43 but it was reported that his HIV had nothing to do with it. Sometimes I like to imagine that he contracted HIV from one of his victims and that they killed him from beyond the grave. Probably 100% fantasy, but a girl can dream right?  Different story that loosely relates to the topic:  I changed names and relationships and many other things to protect people's identities, my job, and my ongoing freedom from prison, no HIPAA violations here!  I work with mentally ill people for a living and I love 99% of my clients and don't fear any of them, even the convicted murders, but there was a point where I feared one. She did not have any violence in her history but was so completely convinced that everyone was out to kill her, even her sister, I feared she'd take the ""I'm gonna get them before they get me"" approach to social interactions as she slyly implied she'd be willing to do so but she was smart and crafty enough to not make out right threats. After each time I saw her, I'd call her therapist and tell her that ""Betty"" was not safe and should be hospitalized (I had no legal power to hospitalize her against her will and neither did her therapist for that matter but he worked in the same office as her doctor, who did hold this power, and had significantly more pull with this doctor than I did. The psychiatrists at this place did not lower themselves to returning phone calls from case managers).  She always said she'd note my opinion but that she disagreed. I'd then cover my ass the best I could by writing a note always saying the same thing: ""This writer believes that ""Betty"" represents a clear danger to others and should be evaluated for involuntary hospitalization - therapist informed of this concern"".   Betty eventually murdered her sister in a manner quite horrific. I've never known a person that killed someone after I knew them, meaning that while a few of my clients had killed people, it was always years before I met them and after they were quite stabilized. Watching someone decompensate to the point that they are capable of murder is scary and sad, especially when something could have been done to stop it. But I sometimes have the selfish thought of ""at least it wasn't me..."" Had Betty somehow gotten away with this murder, I have no doubt she would have killed more people but it would have all been due to a 100% believed thought that these people were going to kill her. There was not a question in her mind and she had felt like that for years, her anxiety was horrific but I think everyone's would be if you knew at least 10 people were actively making attempts on your life everyday and as hard as it may be for some to wrap their heads around, she did know this to be true, she didn't think it, or suspect it, she KNEW it to be the case in the world she lived in that only existed in her head; it just so happens that she was wrong in reality. No medication or therapy that her treatment providers tried made any dent in this delusion."

I don't remember her at all, but my parents keep some vague level of contact with hers.  At the age of 14, Ryan disappeared from the small town of Rockhampton, Australia.  Within a couple of years of this, three other women and a young girl were raped and killed.  Police convicted Leonard Fraser, who'd been previously convicted of multiple rapes, and he confessed to all five murders.  Nobody really doubted that he'd done the lot - it seemed so inconceivable that Rocky was home to one serial killer, let alone multiple murderers.  It was right in the middle of his murder trial that Natasha Ryan turned up alive.  An anonymous tip lead police to discover that Ryan had been living in hiding for five years.  She'd spent most of the time at her boyfriend's house, just a couple of kilometres from her parents'.  The boyfriend had assisted in the search for her after quickly being cleared as a suspect in her disappearance.  He was charged with obstruction, but no other charges or evidence of foul play came of it.  We simply have no idea why Natasha chose to disappear.  It seems like she reconciled with her parents to some extent, but I'm not sure whether she ever explained her actions to them.  In any case, nobody talked to the media;   without any gossip, the media quickly lost interest and the whole thing sank into obscurity.

I wouldn’t use the term subconscious defense mechanism when referring to a mass murderer either, because these types of killers don’t just “snap” and carry out their assaults. There’s a lot of methodical preparation that goes into these crimes and they usually have a motive whether it’s revenge, terror, financial gain, etc. This is evident not only from history, but the mere fact that these people come locked and loaded. They intentionally bring a weapon, intentionally target a specific area or persons, intentionally pull the trigger multiple times. There is absolutely planning. It’s premeditated. To say he had a . . . I don’t know, a bad lapse of judgement? . . . or snapped, and now subconsciously blocked everything out, is a bit of a stretch. Just my opinion, anyway. But the last question you posed is an interesting psychological circumstance. The super short answer is yes, the mind can block out trauma. It’s called repressed memory syndrome or dissociative amnesia. However when dealing with a case like this, that would be the last place I’d explore."

Also I think he talked about the stages (stalking/trolling) described in Serial Killers: The Method and Madness of Monsters by Peter Vronsky, but I could be wrong.

Law enforcement got a warrant and because it was from a Pap smear it was considered medical waste and the property of the university to do with as they pleased. So they turned it over. It didn't require the daughter's permission- or even that she be informed- at any point.  Edit: Clarity."

They needed something a lot more direct. Can you imagine a prosecutor charging someone with ten counts of murder on the basis that he had used the public computer/floppy disk where documents were saved by the killer... oh, and he happened to own the same type of car?"

serialkillers,34in6v,BrianW1999,3,Mon May 4 23:01:00 2015 UTC,"He wasn't really into blood so it wasn't, like, prying out fingernails or death by a thousand cuts or anything. The main thing that could be considered torture was that he enjoyed (as did Gary Ridgway) slowly suffocating his victims to unconsciousness but not death, over and over again. In his first murder, he killed three of the four victims in the same room with clear plastic bags over their heads so they could watch each other die. He let them believe they would survive if they cooperated, then he made them tie each other up. Arguably 90% psychological torture- not that that makes it somehow acceptable or not terrible or anything but it's probably not the sort of things that immediately come to mind when someone thinks about torture."

His implication was that he knew he was batshit crazy. I found that interesting.
serialkillers,34fewy,Superdudeo,24,Thu Apr 30 18:15:24 2015 UTC,I absolutely love Hannibal. It's over the top murder situations are amazing. It's by far one of the best shows on television. It's so dark but mixed with things like the incredible food scenes which I love. It's in my top three shows on tv right now along with True Detective and GoT. Can't wait for the next season.
serialkillers,34fewy,chilly-gin-gins,27,Thu Apr 30 20:19:34 2015 UTC,"The TV Hannibal is very much an AU that takes notes from the book/movie universe and raises them to another level. People say it's awful because races are changed and genders are bent, but for me, it's one of the best shows I have seen on TV in ages. Granted that whole empathy disorder that Graham has is hokem. It's got better production values than most shows on TV. It's not for everyone and it's very very Hollywood. I mean I have seen forensic holes in the show big enough to drive a hearse though and I take it for what it is. It's the serial killer equivalent to CSI, where everyone is pretty and smart and sexy."
serialkillers,34fewy,dazed118,13,Thu Apr 30 20:03:26 2015 UTC,"Grew up with Hopkins so I was reluctant to check out Mikkelsen, but damn he's good. There's honestly nothing I don't enjoy about the series; sound design is stunning, food props are incredible (their food stylist Janice Poon actually runs a blog while the show airs about the food she made for each episodes, which is pretty amazing), and I feel they did a great job bringing it thirty-odd years forward so far. Cast and crew all work their asses off and it pays off for them. I'm definitely looking forward to the new season.  I'll admit, though, going from Hannibal straight to True Detective really deadened the shock factor of the victim in the latter; everyone in TD was a little horrified about the victim and meanwhile I've just seen a human totem pole made of thirty dudes."

The interplay between Fishburne's Crawford and Hannibal is intense. Over the top it is, in a good way. Scott Thompson is hysterical, too; you can see the other players' reactions to him reflect his genuine likability."

Like nearly every other 'serial killer' TV show I've ever watched it is painfully ham-fisted in its presentation of human pscyhology, treats serial killers like unstoppable ultra-brilliant killing machines and focuses more on eye candy than plot.  My wife and I watched the entire thing going simply on faith that it would get better because people are constantly creaming themselves over it."

serialkillers,34fewy,fnordcircle,4,Fri May 1 00:05:08 2015 UTC,I have never heard someone who actually watched Hannibal call it network TV schlock or say it is like every other serial killer show. I straight up don't believe you have seen more than an episode or 2. The show visually and the audio of the show alone make it unlike pretty much anything else on network TV.

serialkillers,34fewy,fnordcircle,1 point,Fri May 1 16:13:12 2015 UTC,"Your description of it was that of someone who hasn't seen the show.

serialkillers,34fewy,thebedshow,2,Fri May 1 16:31:26 2015 UTC,"Didn't know I was required to write an essay.  1 - Character arcs are unbelievable.  Someone who is believed to have been a serial killer and who was incarcerated in a mental institution would not be admitted back onto a task force that deals with serial killers.  The PR shitstorm alone would have been stupid.  2 - Freddie Lounds is a retarded character.  A heap of tropes with no personality beyond ""I'm gonna get to the bottom of this"" who somehow always ends up in the right place at the right time - oh and her blog is apparently the only source of news in town.  3 - Hannibal's 'pscyhology' is just one continual word salad written with all the sophistication of refrigerator magnet poetry.  It's no different than when Hollywood writes about hacking and the like - they just throw jargon at the viewer in lieu of actual, meaningful dialogue.  4 - The typical network 'tiny world' syndrome where every crime that happens anywhere means the same 5 people show up.  A crime in Minnesota wouldn't involve the goddamn Baltimore Field Office.  Oh and Freddie Lounds just happens to show up every time.  It stands up very poorly to a show like True Detective which paints a more realistic scene of the poor, low-intelligence world of your average criminal/serial killer.  And it stands up very poorly to a show like ""The Wire"" which takes great pains to show just how involved and massive criminal investigations are.  But yeah, you're right, I've never seen it."

I am certain that my last sentence was in the pitch to the network. I haven't seen Hannibal all but am staying away, and won't watch Bates Motel. I've seen several episodes of the latter with friends and I can't stand that show."
serialkillers,34fewy,11023517141,0,Thu Apr 30 18:53:37 2015 UTC,"I must have bad taste in TV. I quite like bates motel but I don't consider it in the same genre.   The first season of Hannibal became settled in a 'kill of the week' cycle which became boring. The 2nd season is better but again, they could have made it so much better and darker. I guess you have to satisfy the masses."
serialkillers,34fewy,11023517141,1 point,Thu Apr 30 18:59:15 2015 UTC,"The Bates show is definitely more of a drama/suspense sort of show,  so I can see the appeal. I just find the person Norman is based on, Ed Gein, far more interesting than that show can or is willing to portray. My philosophy is why turn to fiction when reality is far more interesting.   I am not saying you have poor taste in television, I wouldn't judge you or your television choices like that. I am just saying for me in particular I don't enjoy these shows. Besides, I watch Family Guy more often than I care to admit and that is a bad show. :)"
serialkillers,34fewy,TheDeadManWalks,2,Thu Apr 30 19:07:05 2015 UTC,I am reading Red Dragon at the moment. I believe Thomas Harris spent time with the new the undercover department that was set up in the 70/80's that was assigned to serial killers. From that experience it is easy to associate aspects of his characters that were influenced by real life SK's. Ed Gein and Ted Bundy etc. The only character I cannot link is Hannibal Lector. Where did he get the influence/links for a psychopathic doctor of forensic psychiatry?
serialkillers,34fewy,mobzoe,3,Thu Apr 30 19:35:31 2015 UTC,"I always assumed that the character of Hannibal didn't come from any actual person, it originated from the basic idea of a psychiatrist being completely insane, it's an oddly pleasing little paradox. And then Harris compounded that by making Hannibal a perfectly cultured gentleman that turns the base act of cannibalism into something elegant."
serialkillers,34fewy,Sproose_Moose,0,Fri May 1 00:17:08 2015 UTC,I enjoyed Dexter and love Hannibal but I've been hsrdcore warned away from Bates Motel. I've heard it's awful.

serialkillers,34fewy,svperstarr,2,Fri May 1 16:49:22 2015 UTC,I think that was my primary issue with the show - it was hollywood and not realistic.  A realistic take on a brilliant Doctor who also happened to consult for the FBI from time to time would have been fascinating.  Serial killers are just super powered villains in Hollywood and it gets old.

So his looks and facial mannerisms were different than what you would see from him on the streets. They also shaved his head, so that added to the looney bin look. He failed and got a bullet to his head.   He looks relatively normal for a Russian from that time period to me. If I didn't know him and passed him on the street every day I'd think nothing of it.

As others have also noted, it isn't consistent with what we knew about Dahmer's behavior in prison.  That said, still a fascinating read. Thanks for this."
serialkillers,345t1d,BarackSays,9,Tue Apr 28 20:39:02 2015 UTC,"And him saying that what made him snap was one of them tapping him on the shoulder and giggling? Please. Scarver's book deal fell through due to lack of interest, and he just launched a website to sell his poetry. That seems like solid reason to suddenly explain why he did it. And if it's just an attention grab, why bother with reasons that even sound logical?"
serialkillers,345t1d,katiebeans,69,Tue Apr 28 21:26:19 2015 UTC,"I have a hard time believing Jeff would make severed limbs out of food and add blood out of ketchup. That sounds like a made-up excuse. In all his interviews, he came across as a meek person who killed out of strong need, not as a joke or to taunt others.   I know in his youth he was a jokester, but joking about his crimes in prison doesn't seem like his MO. Just my opinion."
serialkillers,345t1d,dethb0y,28,Tue Apr 28 15:24:59 2015 UTC,"I agree. Seems like Scarver is just worried people will forget him, and is bringing up all these new stories. I mean prison food making him insane? Sounds unlikely"
serialkillers,345t1d,OneEyedOneHorned,32,Tue Apr 28 16:01:32 2015 UTC,It could be that in public interviews he acted one way but was another person in private. Remember: serial killers try to manipulate people and garner sympathy and pity.
serialkillers,345t1d,dethb0y,17,Tue Apr 28 19:20:23 2015 UTC,"As far as I've read, prison is boring as fuck. Dahmer could have been messing with the other inmates as a form of cheap entertainment and didn't consider it serious. Even if the meek side of him was what he showed to the media, a long time with little stimulation could make reverting to immature and disturbing attempts at shock jokes seem appealing.  I want to know if Scarver was ever tested for diabetes or other related issues. Blood sugar spikes can cause mood swings and can be affected by various medications, which from the sounds of it, he was probably on at least one psychiatric med."
serialkillers,345t1d,OneEyedOneHorned,8,Wed Apr 29 02:33:39 2015 UTC,"yeah, that's kind of how i feel about dahmer - he might have just been bored and done it a few times, and Scarver either blew it out of proportion, or was just the first person to remark on it."
serialkillers,345t1d,dethb0y,6,Wed Apr 29 03:21:08 2015 UTC,"With the whole carrying-around-an-article-about-Dahmer's-victims thing, it sounds like he became obsessed. It's not really all that surprising, with the amount of serial killer...enthusiasts that exist, there's bound to be a few in it for the revenge fantasy and when the guy had a chance, he took it."
serialkillers,345t1d,OneEyedOneHorned,2,Wed Apr 29 03:35:38 2015 UTC,Nothing wrong with that. Considering what dahmer did and the man's own mental problems - i can't say as i blame him or feel he should be punished for it.
serialkillers,345t1d,dethb0y,1 point,Wed Apr 29 03:37:24 2015 UTC,"With as interesting as I find Dahmer, the psychology and details of his crimes, I'm neutral on what this guy did. It was technically wrong, as murder is regardless of who is involved, but compared to what Dahmer did to his victims, his death was rather swift and clean.  Scarver was given two additional life sentences as he very definitely killed two people. It doesn't matter who they were or if it was subjectively justified. Again, neutral on the whole thing as I don't think anyone would have actually cared if they had let it slide. They fulfilled the requirements of the law and that's it."
serialkillers,345t1d,OneEyedOneHorned,1 point,Wed Apr 29 03:55:05 2015 UTC,"I actually always found that ""rote fulfillment of the law"" rather telling, in truth - i think there is something to it that the prison officials had a hand in Dahmer's death.

serialkillers,345t1d,Psychopath-,21,Tue Apr 28 19:19:02 2015 UTC,i've never heard a single thing about that guy carrying around a Dahmer article. It's always been reported that it was a spat between the two other guys and Dahmer got caught up in it. By all accounts Dahmer was a model prisoner. This guy is making this shit up to sell self published Amazon books.
serialkillers,345t1d,Psychopath-,31,Tue Apr 28 17:29:38 2015 UTC,"Yeahhh... Christopher Scarver is a black man. Many of Dahmer's victims were black. The other victim, Anderson, blamed the murder of his wife (which he committed) on a black man. But no, sure... Scarver killed them both because Dahmer played with his food and one of them poked Scarver in the back but he couldn't tell which one so he bludgeoned them both and called it good."
serialkillers,345t1d,CryMeASmoothie,47,Tue Apr 28 16:07:18 2015 UTC,"I feel like the race explanation makes sense, but not for Scarver. He just seems like a really mentally ill man with delusions of grandeur. He knew he was never getting out, so why not get famous for killing Dahmer? That's what this interview feels like, a ploy to remind people he exists"
serialkillers,345t1d,Dawnspark,8,Tue Apr 28 16:42:51 2015 UTC,"Fair enough.  I kinda feel like the fame thing is more applicable now that people are maybe forgetting. He's probably been mentally ill for a long time, but if anything I think that makes the race explanation more likely- he might've been much more inclined to make it into a legitimate justification in his mind."

serialkillers,345t1d,Dawnspark,7,Wed Apr 29 08:00:13 2015 UTC,"Theres a podcast called Last Podcast on the Left, and they have a 3 part series on Dahmer and it goes into his history a lot and his reasons behind the killings. He's still a monster, but he's also kind of one of the only serial killers you can be sympathetic towards. He was a very lonely man. Extremely ill, but very lonely. As for what I know, Dahmer didn't even enjoy the killing. He had to get black out drunk in order to do it. He was a product killer, not process, like Bundy or Chikatilo were."
serialkillers,345t1d,Baphlingmet,5,Wed Apr 29 12:24:24 2015 UTC,"Exactly this. I always had some amount of sympathy for him because I felt like the people in his life missed a lot of things in his past that should have been dealt with. Last Podcast on the Left is what really made me feel for him though. Obviously he was sick, but he didn't like the killing, he liked the possession of it."
serialkillers,345t1d,GirlNextor123,2,Wed Apr 29 20:08:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, just hearing about the more normal or unimportant things about him kind of drives home that this man that we outwardly perceive as a monster was just that, y'know a man. Sick, but human as any single one of us."
serialkillers,345t1d,Dustcakeboy,4,Wed Apr 29 21:04:26 2015 UTC,"I think it stems from the whole persona Dahmer had of being truly remorseful, and killing out of sheer loneliness. Regardless of if that's true, that's the way he portrayed himself and some people saw themselves in that. There's a lot of depressed and lonely people in this world, and it's comforting to know there's people, like Dahmer, who feel it worse. That's at least part of the deep sympathy."

Sure, there is no literal ""lifestyle"", such as the gang culture, you can point to but it is a case of ""product of your environment"", with variables here and there.  In all honesty I thought about this a lot, what's the difference between a ""serial killer"" who's targeting people for, let's say, being blonde and a gang member who is targeting people because he suspects they are in a rival gang?  The only difference is one is a little more ""socially accepted"", I mean you hear a bout a serial killer murdering people and you instantly are disgusted, you hear about some gang bangers killing people and while you may be disgusted, never to the extent that you would had they been labeled differently."

serialkillers,34372a,BobaFettuccine,5,Wed Apr 29 05:29:18 2015 UTC,do motivations matter? I mean a contract killer is a serial killer the same way someone who routinely kills out of compulsion is a serial killer.
serialkillers,34372a,LittleHelperRobot,16,Tue Apr 28 01:56:17 2015 UTC,A serial killer is usually defined as someone who kills multiple times for sexual/psychological gratification. This is a very particular kind of killer. Contract killers are not labeled as serial killers.
serialkillers,34372a,Anon_Alcoholc,7,Tue Apr 28 02:01:38 2015 UTC,"Non-mobile: serial killer  That's why I'm here, I don't judge you. PM /u/xl0 if I'm causing any trouble. WUT?"
serialkillers,34372a,sailorJery,5,Tue Apr 28 02:01:57 2015 UTC,"I'd argue that most if not all contract killers do so for some kind of psychological gratification as well too. Just look at Richard Kuklinski, fairly obvious his motives stretched beyond just the contract."
serialkillers,34372a,chickendance638,3,Tue Apr 28 11:15:30 2015 UTC,"But it's not explicitly the definition, and I submit that the motivations for murder is secondary to the actual fact that people are being systematically murdered. So when talking serial killers I defer to the FBI's definition which includes anyone who is killing people in   ""a series of two or more murders, committed as separate events, usually, but not always, by one offender acting alone""."
serialkillers,34372a,BobaFettuccine,5,Tue Apr 28 02:08:08 2015 UTC,"I think the definition may improve by adding something like ""business killers"". These would be people like HH Holmes, Kuklinski, and possibly Hernandez.   People who kill not for the ordinary serial killer reasons, but become accustomed to killing and use it because it becomes routine to them."
serialkillers,34372a,chickendance638,2,Tue Apr 28 02:35:46 2015 UTC,"You don't think HH Holmes killed for ordinary serial killer reasons? Some of his kills were for practical purposes, if I remember correctly, but mostly they were out of curiosity or for fun. That seems pretty standard as far as psychological motivations."
serialkillers,34372a,BobaFettuccine,4,Tue Apr 28 04:40:21 2015 UTC,"Holmes did a lot of killing as part of insurance scams and to sell skeletons to medical schools. His crimes aren't well-documented and we don't know how many people he actually killed, but he did murder for money."

serialkillers,34372a,sailorJery,3,Tue Apr 28 11:17:14 2015 UTC,"Well, I prefer the definition of serial killer than includes motivation because when I look up books on serial killers I'm looking for psychopaths who feel a compulsion to kill. I have no interest in mobsters. But if you wanna use the FBI definition, that's cool, too."

I really enjoyed The Iceman movie, as well, but it's just not what I'm looking for when I want serial killer books. I'm more interested in the mind of the killer. People who kill for money don't interest me nearly as much because that's a motive I understand, everyone wants money. It's the torture and murder in order to fulfill some deep seated need that fascinates me. Same reason I'm also not as interested in gang murders or suicides."

serialkillers,33zu5r,BobaFettuccine,13,Mon Apr 27 18:00:44 2015 UTC,"With both murders having been committed on the same day, the killer so far fits more with the profile of a spree killer. That being said, while the cooling-off period is only hours, the murders themselves don't sound to be frenzied and nonstop the way spree killers tend to be. Might be an interesting case to follow- figured I'd post it here anyway in case the murderer does evolve into a serial killer."

serialkillers,3400x1,Crocoshark,3,Mon Apr 27 05:32:39 2015 UTC,"I know we discussed this earlier but you could probably add Dahmer to #1- he kept body parts everywhere and planned on making a shrine to his victims using their skulls. Burke and Hare also sold bodies to medical schools, similar to Holmes's skeletons.  Also, on the subject of Holmes: while I don't believe he did anything like performing surgery on live victims, I think his psychology is probably one of the closest to a killer that would do that, what with his intricate kill rooms rigged specifically so he could watch his victims slowly die.  Edit: Also, cannibalism is surprisingly... not as uncommon as I'd thought. But most cannibals don't seem to be serial killers, they appear to be one-time killers driven by their strange culinary desires. Katherine Knight killed a partner and cooked bits of him, which she then set out to serve to his children (though there's some evidence this was done specifically to lay the groundwork for an insanity plea). Armin Meiwes is likely one of the better-known cannibals, and his was a willing victim. The Crossbow Cannibal allegedly ate the prostitutes he killed (with that name, who would've guessed, right?) There are a lot more... way more than I realized... but none that I can find that fit the criteria exactly."

I wonder, why do you think it is that my criteria don't really overlap? Has no human ever been that fucked up?

serialkillers,3400x1,Psychopath-,2,Mon Apr 27 18:25:16 2015 UTC,"I definitely think it's an issue of both psychology and convenience. Most killers have something specific they're aiming to get out of the murder as well as the method they use to achieve that gratification. If something doesn't lead directly to that, they won't do it. I think it's just that we've never seen the variables align just right to result in the outcome you're discussing."

serialkillers,3400x1,Psychopath-,2,Mon Apr 27 21:35:50 2015 UTC,"Well, one interesting thing to me is that the sort of killer who would disembowel, torture, or perform surgery on a live victim would be a sadist or sexual sadist whereas often, cannibals consume their victims almost as a sign of respect or remembrance. Those two particular pathologies are almost on entirely opposite ends of the spectrum, which might account for the lack of overlap in those criteria, at least.  He would need to be a sadistic sociopath who sees his victims as animals to be consumed. He would see himself as superior, to the extent of considering himself outside the species. Likely a raging narcissist. Essentially a real-life version of Hannibal Lecter (in fact, I think the new version meets all your criteria exactly, which is why I initially asked who your fictional prototype was)."
serialkillers,3400x1,Psychopath-,2,Mon Apr 27 21:56:14 2015 UTC,"That's funny, 'cause the initial description of the killer that inspired this post does come off llke a sadist:  . . . he carefully placed a scalpel against her skin. With precision he began to cut away at her.  The scream of her younger sister echoed around the room as the image faded . . . She sobbed to herself as she remembered the horrific images of her sister being dissected alive  ""Come now, you must eat. There's no point in letting yourself go hungry."" . . . All that remained of her sister now was the lifeless upper-half that still was strapped to the table. She hadn't seen what he'd done with the rest of her after he'd finished.  ""Here, I even made you this special treat."" He said opening a small hole in the cage, pushing a plate with a cupcake on it.  However later description of the killer reminiscing seems inconsistent in that it someone much more insane, with a much wider disconnect from reality  Balloons lay scattered around, long since deflated. Old streamers line the trees, confetti is scattered amongst the leaves and grass. So many parties were thrown here, so many of my friends would I invite. They loved my parties, every moment of them. This table would often become covered in the remains of a good partying day. It's been so long since I saw it re-painted that wonderfully glossy deep-red color. All that remains are the old stains of parties long since gone.  The memories of our games are strong though. My favorite game was always surgeon, a game that always required a high level of skill and precision. My friends loved to make it harder on me too, by squirming and trying to escape my hold, but it was all in good fun. I would take them apart and see what made them tick inside. Then we'd have the ingredients to make the most wonderful snacks for all our friends; my mouth still waters at the deliciously salty, though slightly bitter, taste.  It's almost . . . innocent, like the killer is so far gone he sees his victims as ""play mates"", or at least ""play things"" like the kind of guy so out of it he wouldn't go long enough without getting caught to even become a serial killer.  I wonder if any serial killer has viewed their victims as almost like imaginary friends. It reminds me of a scene in the movie Happy Birthday To Me where the killer is sitting at the table of her birthday party surrounded by the corpses of her guests."

My great-uncle was a pastor in the area and went to the funeral because he knew how hated Oswald was but believed everyone should have the opportunity to be buried with honor. When the others didn't come and there was no one to speak for Oswald, he got up and said a few words. It was very basic, just something like, ""his mother tells us he was a good man and now we trust him into your arms, Lord.""

I'm evidence of the carryover effect for sure:  I never considered for a moment how monstrous and devastatingly brutal each killing was.  I guess it was a blind spot of naïveté for me to consider how cold, calculating and viscerally violent he actually was.

serialkillers,33tfv2,thatsboxy,3,Sun Apr 26 22:50:35 2015 UTC,"Well, think of it this way. Prostitutes are easy victims because of their lifestyle, their willingness to get into cars with strangers, and the belief that no one will notice them missing for a while so the killer has time to get rid of the victim and move on without being detected. SKs can then rack up a huge body count with women prostitutes before anyone even knows who the killer is. Vulnerability plays a factor in victim preference, size and stature, sexual sadistic characteristics of the killer, and I’ll mirror what others have said about SKs being primarily male. And also a woman’s temperament. They become easy prey when they don’t want to appear rude if someone gets a little pushy with them so they acquiesce until it’s too late to get away. Or they talk themselves out of intuition, convince themselves some guy is just “harmless” and so forth. Although, I’m interested in stats that compare male homosexual SKs who kill other men or boys vs. SKs who kill women. Body count wise…hmm  Anyway, yes there have been many studies on victimology and why women are targeted by serial killers."

I reckon if you spread out all serial offending, murders of girls/women may be ahead, though I would wager not by as much as would appear.

serialkillers,33tfv2,geniusgrunt,11,Sat Apr 25 16:17:51 2015 UTC,"There is statistical data on serial killer victims. Most are female just because that is the pathology of the serial killer. Majority of serial killers are also men as I'm sure you are aware and most serial killings involve a sexual element.   According to FBI data, women accounted for 70 percent of the 1,398 known victims of serial killers during the 1985 to 2010 timeframe (1). By way of comparison, females represented only 22 percent of all other homicide victims in the U.S. during that same time period. Based on these statistics, the victim is 3.5 times more likely to be female in a serial murder incident than in a non-serial homicide incident."

He (Harold) was always favorited by his mother and put on a bit of a pedestal. I think that might have been what drove him to be a doctor, the feeling helpless when she was dying and then wanting to live up to her expectation of him.

serialkillers,33dkza,phaerietales,3,Tue Apr 21 23:25:26 2015 UTC,most serial killers have no empathy or sympathy for others and describe themselves as emotionless.  It probably did not phase him that she died.

Eventually, his mother abandoned him by moving away and not telling his father. It's not, like, incredible abuse, but it's not a healthy way to be raised for sure.

I mean stories of sexual abuse are on the rise now that it's getting more awareness. It's not like that stuff just started happening, it's that people are willing to bring it out in the open more now.  Like in one special I saw on Dahmer, his dad talked about how he'd clean out animal bones from under the porch or something, and he'd collect them in a bucket. The noise had amused Jeffery, so he gave them to Jeffery to play with.   It sounds kinda dark and all, I mean considering who we're talking about. But then there's probably people who have done similar and didn't end up being stone cold killers. Go on a nature walk and you're bound to come across some bones here and there. It's safe to say a portion of people who come across that may be interested and want to examine them."

On the subject of British killers, I've never heard anything about Peter Sutcliffe having anything remarkable about his childhood at all.

serialkillers,33dkza,torndress,7,Tue Apr 21 20:58:45 2015 UTC,"To be candid about Jeffrey Dahmer: he had a less than stellar childhood but it was, for the most part, “normal” if there is such a thing. His father worked long hours doing his thing in chemistry and going back to school (I think it was chemistry), his parents never abused him, he had a very small number of friends but friends nonetheless, and had interests he engaged in. Sure his parents fought and eventually separated, but is that an absolute sign of anomalous, destructive behavior? Anybody here a latch-key kid or had a parent that worked a lot? I guess taxidermy and collecting animal bones is out of the norm in terms of typical interests, but I would not go as far to say it’s abnormal in the psychological sense. Boys hunt and skin animals as sport, after all. Would this automatically be categorized as deviant, psychopathic behavior? Not at all. It’s onIy abnormal when you piece what you know about him now with what was learned about him in his early life. But of course, every commentator says “well, I should have saw it coming because he did xyz, come to think of it. How fitting.” Isolated, it’s not a red flag. I think his fundamental issue was his homosexuality and feelings of abandonment by his mother, not father. Hence why he was a cannibal. He never wanted to let his victims leave him; eventually, his mother took off. But this was also later in his development. And probably his genetic make-up played a substantial role. There’s a lot to get into about his mother, but you can’t dismiss the argument that there are many kids out there, especially in today’s economic climate, that have parents who both work and fight."

serialkillers,33aawj,Wrath_Of_Aguirre,8,Tue Apr 21 04:30:15 2015 UTC,"I think that's because people like him are predators of chance. He just got a lot of them and perfected what it took to get into that situation again.  We all have this scary image of serial killers as meniacle deranged people when in fact the scary part is that they hide their dark side so well, we become disarmed at how average they seem.   The majority of them at least.  When you talk about others that have victim counts in the triple digits, I'm pretty sure those ones have a compulsion."
serialkillers,33aawj,Ryesagain,4,Tue Apr 21 06:40:47 2015 UTC,"I agree. I can think of several other killers (Dahmer, Kemper, BTK to name a few) who used their disarming demeanor to fool everybody, including police who spoke to them before they were suspected of any murders."

serialkillers,33arlq,torndress,7,Tue Apr 21 00:43:04 2015 UTC,"Wait... Jeffrey Dahmer? Wut?  EDIT: MOTHER OF GOD... Jeffrey Dahmer enlisted in 1979 at the behest of his father , and became a Medical Specialist at Fort Sam Houston. He then went to Germany, and served the rest of his time until 1981, when although considered average to above average as a soldier, was given honorable discharge.  TIL.  Also, I wonder what all services they all had, and what the most common branch was. I am willing to bet Army is the most common one."

serialkillers,33arlq,gabrielsburg,6,Tue Apr 21 01:02:05 2015 UTC,"Personally, I don’t think military service provoked his behaviors at all. I don’t think it alters any serial killer’s behavior, to be quite honest. I can go hardcore into detail about the genetics and environmental side of the age-old “what make a serial killer tick” inquiry, but I think the egg came before the chicken here. And in most cases actually. That’s a different topic, why killers seek the military.  Dahmer was into cutting up animals, taxidermy, and bone cataloging from an alarmingly young age. And I say alarmingly because it went waaaay beyond common childhood curiosity. He also fantasized about killing a male neighborhood jogger, and eventually killed a young kid at his parent's house before he ever enlisted. I think he was like 17-18 at the time. And for the purpose of overkill/brutality, he chopped him up in the kitchen and drove around with his remains in his car (in a garbage bag) – all prior to the army. So I’d be inclined to believe an individual with a predisposition to violence and control, coupled with the environment he was raised in, and a yearning to change/an internal realization something is wrong (whether he thinks it’s mentally or biologically) would seek the regimented environment of the armed forces."
serialkillers,33arlq,torndress,2,Tue Apr 21 01:26:12 2015 UTC,"Certainly time in service can agitate a perpetrators behaviour to be more willing to commit violence and murder no? I mean, even if the person is, say, the regular old 42A who pushes pencils, or even the 25 series of Commo. Cause throughout service you have to deal with the stress of being a better servicemember, or your NCO (Sergeants) get a little too much in your face, time after time, so to vent a person goes out on weekends and starts doing little. Acts, which get bigger and bigger with each ""adventure""? That or they take their training,, whatever it may be, to be a more disciplined killer.  I could see the service hand someone the tools to effectively kill and hide the remains.  I mean, hell, every day I go to the DFAC, Forensic Files is on one of the many television sets. Lol.   Well, I could see the military being less provocative for serial killer behaviour today, especially in certain units. There is a thing old members say now, ad they call us ""the New Army"", because of the lac in rules and discipline. This may be a release from tension generations before have seen. Causing for a decrease in killers and murderers alike in the Army. Less stress = less killers? I have no evidence to support this. But I wish I did.   I am sure somewhere in the Pentagon is an office that has records and statistics that give whole graphs as to the increase or decrease in violence and service member involved killings. Any time something happens, most of the community knows. Would be no reason for the Pentagon not to have records.  (End ramblings of MIR)"
serialkillers,33arlq,gabrielsburg,2,Tue Apr 21 01:39:55 2015 UTC,"I doubt the Pentagon tracks that. There are certain things they don't want to know definitively. This is one of them. I also doubt military service produces or exacerbates murderous tendencies (or, in the case of exacerbation, does so any more than the stresses of any other job). The last place a budding serial killer (who wants POWER) would want to be is in a private's boots getting bossed around by a drill sergeant or NCO who hates his or her job."

I believe he has severe narcissism and a violent personality disorder. He has never shown any remorse and refers to what he did as ""the circumstances"" of his life. Even though he takes responsibility for his vile acts, he seems to convey a sense of ""I couldn't help it; there was no other way."" He couldn't just leave his family broke and homeless- that would make him a ""failure"" as a father and husband. He had to obliterate them and make them go away, I think to clear his conscience from being the failure he was. Which is fucking scary to think about. This is all my opinion, mind you.   edit: words"
serialkillers,33734n,zoso4evr,2,Mon Apr 20 15:08:27 2015 UTC,In the film they mention his narcissism but not so much the violent personality. He's portrayed as very creepy and very somber the entire time. Yeah I kinda felt that the murders were an excuse for his failure but that he has to be somewhat delusional to think that he has to murder his family to save them from his failure.
serialkillers,33734n,zoso4evr,3,Mon Apr 20 17:54:17 2015 UTC,I guess I see the violence having manifested itself through a desperate action of his ego and narcissism trying to destroy from reality the very thing that threatened his ego- his family. I think he saw them more as objects which stood in the way and held a mirror to his his self-serving lifestyle and delusional self-image.

serialkillers,337n08,Bovine-Gyro,1 point,Mon Apr 20 07:43:01 2015 UTC,"Many of you may be familiar with Joseph Duncan's previous blog (http://fifthnail.blogspot.com/?m=1) spanning the course of about two years during his probation, which became increasingly erratic and difficult to follow. The first blog is a record of his life on parole for sexual abuse of a boy for which he was incarcersted for most of his adult life. The blog frequently discusses Duncan's inane ramblings about percieved injustace he faced as a sexual offender as well as mundane bits of his life in Fargo, North Daktoa working as a sofware engineer and taking courses at a college, until it begins to dark a darkee turn. As we later learned, Duncan had returned to his previous behavior during his parole,  killing a child in California for which he was convicted and two native american girls in Washington State for which he was not convicted but confessed. He is most remembered for his brutal murders in and around Cor'dAlene Idaho where he killed 3 members of a family, kidnappend the two youngest of the same family, and eventually killed one of the children as he forced the other to watch, videotaping the ordeal as well.   I was, however, unaware that he has been blogging since 2010 from federal death row in  Terre haute Indiana  by writing letters to a friend who publishes them on a new but similarly-named blog which I have linked in the title of this thread.

serialkillers,32wxxj,midnitetoker87,28,Fri Apr 17 12:07:23 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree! I think it was Ridgway who said that killing wasnt part of it originally but he had to get rid of the only witness to the torture. However, with Gacy, because violent sex was such a high motive in his behavior, as well as Ridgway,  and considering their psychopathy, I question the validity of their statements that killing was just to eliminate somebody who could put them in jail. With Bundy, the killing was the biggest part of it, the most sexually gratifying part about it despite the violent sex before or after his victims' deaths. So I wonder, if, at first, Gacy killed these young men to get rid of a witness and I wonder if the act of killing itself ever became sexually arousing like it does in many other serial killers."
serialkillers,32wxxj,11023517141,9,Fri Apr 17 13:40:54 2015 UTC,"I agree, it probably was the start of why but eventually the act became more about the murder than the rape"
serialkillers,32wxxj,11023517141,10,Fri Apr 17 13:53:10 2015 UTC,"I agree. Plus,  with psychopathy, it is common to change or increase the violence in order to maintain the same level of sexual gratification. So perhaps Gacy did it first to eliminate witnesses and that's it because raping and torturing these individuals was enough to get him off. But eventually,  the rape and torture isn't enough,  he develops a sort of ""tolerance"" to it where it just isnt doing the trick anymore. So then murder becomes the focus, the act of murder itself is what gets him to achieve sexual gratification. We see this a lot in psychopathy because of the way their brains function,  they need significant and ever-increasing stimuli to feel excited whether it is just an adrenaline rush or sexual excitement.   An example of this tolerance is of a man whom I had the fortune to have never met but my colleagues were not as fortunate. He was a psychopath and he liked to find stray dogs and cats, tie them up and duct tape their mouths shut and set them on fire. Eventually, they found these corpses without any duct tape. When they finally caught them and asked why the duct tape wasn't part of it any more, he said it was because he couldn't orgasm to just burning them anymore, he came when he heard them scream.   I imagine in Gacy's case, as with most serial killers, he had to up the stimuli with murder."

These are really similar but different,  and you are absolutely correct about connecting a serial killer's behavior to that of a drug addiction. There is a lot of research right now trying to figure out if this violence is indeed addicting to them and if they do develop a tolerance to it so they need to change what they do (raping doesnt do it so murder does, murder doesn't do it anymore so now torture does, and so on). This behavior is tolerance to the violence just like a drug addiction!"

I have read and reread ""The Only Living Witness"" whose authors I've forgotten but it is about interviews with Bundy. My go-to book about psychopathy is Dr. Robert Harry's ""Without Conscience"" which walks you through psychopathy but not serial killing, however, understanding psychopathy is vital in understanding serial killers."

serialkillers,32wxxj,11023517141,2,Sun Apr 19 04:19:06 2015 UTC,"I think it was Ridgway who said that killing wasnt part of it originally but he had to get rid of the only witness to the torture.    I'd always heard that Ridgeway had stated a number of times (even to the cops themselves) that he thought that he was basically doing them a favor by murdering prostitutes- and that the fact that he wasn't being caught was basically tacit approval from law enforcement.   And I'm not a Ridgeway expert by any means, but he didn't abduct and torture anyone, did he? He mostly legitimately picked up prostitutes in their business capacity, had sex, then strangled them? He could have let any of them go without suspicion.   With Gacy I'd be slightly more inclined to believe that the killing at least came about as a way to remove inconvenient people, since he started in 1967 as a serial rapist and that landed him in jail the first time. Still, the man was perfectly willing to leave A LOT of witnesses/escapees in his trail, initially. I think it's just more likely that he enjoyed the ""accidental"" murder of Tim McCoy so much he just decided to go with that moving forward."
serialkillers,32wxxj,Flyonz,3,Sat Apr 18 09:42:22 2015 UTC,"He may have! I am by no means well-versed in the Ridgway cases either, I just remembering watching one of the police interviews with him on Youtube where he stated to an either a police interrogator or FBI interrogator that he only killed them to get rid of the witness, that killing wasn't a part of it. This was several months ago so I will look for the clip and post it on here if I can find it again. Also, he could have been lying in the clip I watched to save his own ass or make him look less terrible than Bundy or Dahmer or the ones who killed for the sake of killing. I am not sure about the torture stuff with Ridgway. I remember in the clip he did say he had raped (paid them once, got off, then raped them) many of them, and in Ann Rule's book about the Ridgway cases she discusses that they found large rocks in some of his victims' vaginas. She speculated on torture using those, but no one's really touched on that in any of the websites I've read. I think you are absolutely right about why Gacy started to murder."

serialkillers,32wxxj,JohnFell,4,Fri Apr 17 14:58:24 2015 UTC,"So some people commit murder for sexual gratification,  some do it in the heat of the moment such as a brawl, some do it for money, for love, and for revenege while some also do it in the name of their god or their country. Leaving no witnesses behind is not the only motive for murder,  and it is certainly not the only motive for murder for serial killers. Ridgway was just an example I used to illustrate that even he, the most prolific serial murderer in U.S. history, didn't kill for the sake of killing like someone like Bundy did to achieve sexual gratification from the act of murder in itself, but to avoid jail time."
serialkillers,32wxxj,DressesandDolls,16,Fri Apr 17 17:31:51 2015 UTC,"Bundy mainly subdued his victims at the onset of the abduction.  His method of bludgeoning them with a tire iron or club from behind would seem to have basically rendered them brain damaged, or completely subdued, and almost unaware of what he was doing.  I therefore think that he was essentially a necrophile when it came to his sexual antics.  I haven't read a lot of just what he liked to do with them, but he certainly enjoyed his victims most when they were dead.  Gacy, on the other hand, liked the experience of killing his victims while having sex with them, didn't he?  He was into ropes and strangling, and definitely enjoyed the struggle, the suffocation, the coming to, the struggle, repeat - i.e. the rage and the terror.  Back to Bundy, he didn't want a fighter at all.  Just my thoughts."

How many serial killers have we been able to precisely catalogue/profile -  Without public speculation and theory, anyway. People are people, and people differ. It’s merely speculation until otherwise proven or stated. Serial killers, they’re a multidimensional group. Gacy was more disturbed than what meets the eye, so to speak. I also agree with your assertion that he had a “mis-wiring” that routed to his inner deviance. Good catch. A lot of killers have a specific trigger. Perhaps his was having someone in detention?"

Lucas was convicted of murdering 11 people and condemned to death for a single case with an unidentified victim. A newspaper exposed the improbable logistics of the confessions made by Lucas, when they were taken as a whole, and a study by the Attorney General of Texas concluded he had falsely confessed; the death sentence was commuted to life in prison in 1998.

serialkillers,32wxxj,resonanteye,2,Mon Apr 20 16:41:44 2015 UTC,"His motive(s) is/are a little complicated, in my opinion. First, you have to realize that he’s essentially a copy-cat killer. A lot of people don’t realize this but his method of procurement and restraint, and even torture techniques are nearly identical to another infamous serial killer from the 60s-70s. If you follow this model, then his purpose to kill would drastically change from just wanting to have sex with a young male victim without having them go to the police, to having more control over the situation and the persons involved for an intensified, direct gratification. And I say that because he first learned of the handcuff trick and torture board from an accomplice to the serial killer in the 60s-70s who had no qualms with spilling the beans about intimate detail. The killer received enjoyment from both participating in the act of rape/murder, and from watching his groomed accomplices do the same. Maybe not so much rape but more torture, and submitting to his authority. That’s not to say that Gacy, at his core, wanted to rape young men without consequence, but it’s a complex case that has a ton of loose ends. One of the members from the Chicago Rippers was, at one point, working for Gacy. Is it mere coincidence that another sexual sadist and psychopath just happened upon an active serial killer?"

The harm, the killing, was probably the motivation, although he'd be likely to have denied that and insisted that he was just covering up ""fun sex that was frowned on"".

The power over life and death gives you absolute control over a situation, whether you want that control so that you can force a person to stay with you (Dahmer) or so they won't tell the police about you, it all boils down to having full control and power.

The article doesn't mention that the head of the investigation, John Du Rose, had what he felt was a strong suspect, a security guard who worked the area, called Mungo Ireland.

Ireland ended up committing suicide instead. Whilst Ireland did leave behind a potentially incriminating note, there still wasn't enough evidence to prove for sure he was guilty, and the murders remain officially unsolved.

serialkillers,32mfhn,fernando_69,2,Sat Apr 25 13:59:01 2015 UTC,"""Pedro Alonso López (born October 8th, 1948) is a Colombian serial killer, accused of raping and killing more than 300 girls across his native country, then Peru and Ecuador, and possibly other countries. Aside from uncited local accounts, López’s crimes first received international attention from an interview conducted by Ron Laytner, a long time freelance photojournalist who reported interviewing López in his Ambato prison cell in 1980.  Laytner’s interviews were widely published, first in the Chicago Tribune on Sunday, July 13, 1980, then in the Toronto Sun and The Sacramento Bee on July 21 1980, and later in many other North American papers and foreign publications over the years. Apart from Laytner’s account and two brief Associated Press wire report the story was published in The World's Most Infamous Murders by Boar and Blundell. According to Laytner’s story, López became known as the ""Monster of the Andes"" in 1980 when he led police to the graves of 59 of his victims in Ecuador, all girls between nine and twelve years old. In 1983 he was found guilty of murdering 110 young girls in Ecuador alone and confessed to a further 240 murders of missing girls in neighbouring Peru and Colombia. López was released in 1998 from a psychiatric hospital on good behavior after initially being found insane.""  So there ya have it."

It is disappointing that there were so many arrows pointing at him and the evidence surrounding his murders were deemed 'unreliable' because they were from prostitutes who had drug addictions. These women were subject to so much violent assault and crime when they were on the street. The lifestyle of a prostitute made them less qualified for justice and their evidence less admissible. Crazy.

Like this article says, it's not uncommon to have multiple family members/friends/acquaintances killed in separate violent events. Even in my own family, which is only part indigenous, we have lost multiple female relatives to murder. I think people often forget about the victims of serial killers, especially when they're from marginalised groups like First Nations. It's easy to not care, especially when they are vulnerable people anyway, to just accept the violence against them.

The more documentaries like this that are out there and TV series like Dexter, the smarter serial killers will get and learn to hide their tracks better.   And then when the killer eventually gets caught theres always this payoff at the end of finding out about his upbringing and seeing how early life experiences can shape you into a monster.   I think this is why the ending of 'true detective' was kind of unsatisfying to me. They (spoilers!) just found and killed the antagonist, and that was it.

I read his description of Josef Mengele and went home that day and Googled everything I could about him and his crimes. Got a couple books too. His behavior was so absolutely horrifying that I needed to learn everything I possibly could about him and other serial killers. I wanted to know why they did that, what got them to a point in their life where doing that was necessary for them. Mengele was a brutal introduction to serial killers, but after reading everything I could get my hands on about him, I moved on to Gein,  repeat, then Bundy. I remember being so fascinated with Bundy that instead of studying for my biology final I read another biography on him. This fascination governed my entire college experiences, my degrees, my research, and now my life. Now I study psychopathy professionally. There is something so terrifying about their behavior that I wont be satisfied until I find the reasons why myself."

serialkillers,31vgyr,mws85,2,Thu Apr 9 04:45:59 2015 UTC,I have a question. Is it nurture or nature?
serialkillers,31vgyr,11023517141,4,Thu Apr 9 03:09:28 2015 UTC,"That's a tough question as most serial killers carry out their sentences of capital punishment and we are unable to study them. Psychopaths, on the other hand, are much more common so we get to study them and hope it sheds light on the behavior of serial murderers. Unfortunately the nurture side is incredibly hard to study because no parent wants to admit that their child is exhibiting psychopathic behaviors, and you cannot receive a ""diagnosis"" of psychopathy until you are 18 or older. So we don't know much about the nurture side right now. If you are interested in the nurture aspect such as the similarities in early child development and environment with serial killers, I can send you the latest metaanalysis on it discussing that they all have overbearing mothers, are predominantly white, etc. Just PM me as I am out of town for the next few days and will not be able to get to it immediately. We know a little more about the nature side and the neurological deficits they all have (severe gray matter reductions of the frontal lobe and limbic system to name a few) but whether those are genetic or epigenetic is yet to be determined. TL; DR nobody knows."
serialkillers,31vgyr,mws85,3,Thu Apr 9 04:44:16 2015 UTC,I'm not an expert but I've always been of the belief that's its a bit of both. Nature in thst they were born with something not quite right within the brain and then the nature part comes into play and the two mesh and you end up getting what you get.  For instance you might have someone born with a predisposition to psychopathy/being a serial killer but they have a very loving family and maybe grow up within wealth and instead of becoming a serial killer or a violent offender end up being an investment banker or work within finance or as a ceo and they lack empathy and compassion and morals but they make their 'sickness' if you will pay for them . I could be way off there though admittedly.
serialkillers,31vgyr,mws85,3,Sat Apr 11 01:19:14 2015 UTC,"I think you are spot-on! Dr. Robert Hare, the guy that came up with the first and most widely accepted and used ""diagnostic"" tool for psychopathy avtually distinguishes between violent psychopaths and what he calls ""snakes in suits"", or psychopaths like Bernie Madoff for example, who are bankers and CEOs and politicians. It is likely they have the same neurological deficits violent psychopaths have, and that their nurture ia what makes them a CEO and not a Ted Bundy. However, as you can imagine, these people are extremely hard to find and if you find them, it is unlikely they will volunteer to let you study them neurologically and psychologically.  So, unfortunately no one has been able to study the nurture side of psychopaths yet."

Now I know its not your field but what's your personal take on sexuality?  Is it nature or nurture or?"
serialkillers,31vgyr,11023517141,3,Mon Apr 13 01:44:49 2015 UTC,"Nature. I will have to refer you to Dr. Simon Levay's groundbreaking study discussing the neurological differences of cis heterosexual male and cis homosexual male brains. The area of the brain in question is the hypothalamus which is responsible for regulating what we call ""the four F's""-feeding, fighting,  fleeing, and mating. Obviously, the last one is of our interest in the present discussion. The hypothalamus of a gay man has both a significant reduction in gray matter (neurons) and these neurons are significantly smaller than you would find in a straight man. Having fewer and smaller neurons doesn't mean there is something wrong with this individual, as their hypothalamus equals its amount and size of neurons with that of the hypothalamus of a heterosexual female.   Neurological differences in themselves are not necessarily an indication of nature controlling something (think traumatic brain injuries, etc.) But neurological differences in such a huge population across all cultures is significantly indicative that nature is playing a role, if not the whole role, in sexuality.   I am not familiar with genetics but there is some research to suggest genes may ne responsible.  There is also some research supporting the idea that pre-natal hormones influence sexuality of the fetus as well. There is little research on cis homosexual females and nothing as striking as the LeVay studies."

Not quite as morbid as serial killers, but there is still a little bit of morbidity associated with that. I also really loved ""Museums of the weird""/Cabinet of Curiosities type stuff. I've noticed a lot of people interested in serial killers also like this stuff.  Then I got really into pirates, which was my first interest in crime stuff. I just thought it was really interesting how outside normal society they were. I think not that long after that I found a book about Jack the Ripper, and that really fascinated me.  Then I started reading horror and learned about other serial killers and it scared the crap out of me, but also fascinated the hell out of me, they were like the ultimate freaks. It's just this weird and horrifying side of life, but damn interesting too.   I just like the weird side of history in general, the stuff that people don't really talk about much.

serialkillers,31vgyr,BrianW1999,3,Fri Apr 10 19:58:19 2015 UTC,I think fear mainly. I remember when I was young being scared of sharks and snakes so I studied them. I learned what they did where they lived and how to reached if I ever incountered one.   I was about 7 when I realized that people killed other people. However I thought as a male I was safe because I only heard about men killing women. I thought I was exempted until Damher I lived near Milwaukee growing up and his case was all over the news. It frightened me. So I decided like animals I was scared of I had to investigate. I've been curious ever since. The only draw back is serial killers are not sharks our snakes they reached I'll rationally and it's nearly impossible to avoid. Like if you don't want to be but by a shark stay out of the ocean. Don't want to run into a snake avoid the desert. Serial killers live seemingly everywhere and although only a small amount of the population fall under that category they can kill without reason. So I'm still scared of them so I need to learn more.

It's like a foreign world where the rules I know don't apply, and I find it interesting. I've also always been a bit preoccupied with death, having experienced a lot of it before I became an adult. This doesn't so much deal with serial killers directly, but just a possible explanation of my morbid curiosity. I am honestly scared of death, but learning about it helps me to understand it.  And then there the whole addictive bit that goes with solving puzzles and logic games. I think reading up on crime investigations scratches a similar itch for me.

I'm more concerned about missing people and disappearances in general but in order to learn more about their cases, it's often important to know a lot about violent offenders and serial killers.  There's been a lot of murder and death in my family, so my mum was always telling me to be wary, and 'going missing' was always something that was in the back of my mind while I was growing up. Then when I reached my teenage years I realised that I was quite similar to a lot of girls who went missing/were murdered - small, trusting, friendly, not necessarily from the most stable family, not necessarily partaking in the most wholesome activities - and it just kind of made me want to acknowledge them as people, and learn whatever I could about their disappearances and their circumstances. So for me it's less serial killers and more an interest in missing persons and what can be done to protect vulnerable and endangered people and what can be done to prevent violent offenders from getting to the point where they're able to freely act out their violent fantasies."

Particularly with serial killers, where the victims are often strangers who have never done anything to hurt the killer. Honestly I'm not sure how much actual understanding I've gained from reading about them, but the curiosity remains!"

I really want to understand what factors play into making someone a serial killer, and what leads them to do such crazy stuff. I love trying to understand the why from their perspective. To understand the differences between the psychopath, the sociopath, or the murderer who is completely sane."
serialkillers,31vgyr,pentestscribble,2,Fri Apr 24 03:13:17 2015 UTC,I grew up in California during the 70's and 80's.  There were many serial killers active there during that time but the I-5 bandit Randall Woodfield murdered my friend's mother and sister. My fascination is primarily with their psychological make up and the men and women who make it their job to catch them.

I also remember watching Unsolved Mysteries as a kid and being horrified (even scared!) by the cases, but super intrigued by the mystery -- who did it? Why? Would they ever be caught?  But I think the first time that I can remember taking an active interest in serial killers in particular was when BTK was arrested, when I was in my early 20s. I found the case extremely fascinating because of how ""normal"" or even ""good"" Rader appeared to everyone around him, all the while feeding, and hiding, his dark and twisted side. The idea that someone who functioned so well in society could commit such horrible crimes in secret for so long did not make any sense to me. How could he be so liked, be a part of the church, have a family, all while doing those awful things? I became very interested by the seemingly very thin line that separates ""us"" from ""them"" and it has spurred me to continue reading and learning about other killers and mysteries."

Dahmers parents lived in the house then got separated - Dad moved to motel and didnt know his wife/Dahmers mom had moved out with his other son and was surprised to find out Dahmer was alone when he came back home. Unusual circumstance... my pithy cherry comment wasnt meant to be fact filled...  And I say victim(s) because though he admitted to Hicks, they could not find his complete remains and Dahmer didnt kill again for 9 years after that? Though he remained in the house alone for at least nine weeks. Not saing there is or are any other victims but not shutting the door on the possibility. I have been to the bar near the Bath home where the original owners still tend bar and have heard of Dahmer going home with other men. Just because it hasnt been discovered doent mean it didnt happen.   Dahmer committed his first murder in the summer of 1978, at the age of 18, just three weeks after his graduation. At the time, he was living alone in the family home: due to his parents' recent divorce, Dahmer's father temporarily lived in a nearby motel and his mother had relocated to Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin[34] with his younger brother. On June 18,[35] Dahmer picked up an 18-year-old hitchhiker named Steven Mark Hicks.[36][37] Dahmer lured the youth to his house on the pretext of the pair drinking alcohol together. Hicks, who had been hitchhiking to a rock concert in Lockwood Corners, agreed to accompany Dahmer to his house. According to Dahmer, after several hours' drinking and listening to music, Hicks ""wanted to leave and [I] didn't want him to"".[38] In response, Dahmer bludgeoned him with a 10 lb. dumbbell. Dahmer later stated he struck Hicks twice from behind[39] with the dumbbell as he (Hicks) sat upon a chair. When Hicks fell unconscious, Dahmer strangled him to death with the bar of the dumbbell, then stripped the clothes from Hicks' body before masturbating as he stood above the corpse.[39]  The following day,[40] Dahmer dissected Hicks's body in his crawl space; he later buried the remains in a shallow grave in his backyard[41] before, several weeks later, unearthing the remains and paring the flesh from the bones.[42] The flesh he dissolved in acid before flushing the solution down the toilet; the bones he crushed with a sledgehammer and scattered in woodland behind the family home.[43]  Six weeks after the murder of Hicks, Dahmer's father and his fiancée returned to his home where they discovered Jeffrey living alone at the house.    fromWiki"

Sometimes the only leverage COs have is the inmates' privileges. It's difficult to further punish someone who essentially lives in solitary with no chance of that ever changing. I understand it might rub people the wrong way to see the worst of the worst seemingly lounging around with ""luxuries"" but if the hope of a Mountain Dew keeps Charlie from biting or pissing on a CO or he decides not to kill some fellow inmate out of boredom because the consequent boredom of having no television would be unfathomable... sometimes those trades are just the smart ones to make.

serialkillers,31b6j5,_rattlesnake,4,Fri Apr 3 14:08:17 2015 UTC,"Some more information:  i) Peter Merylo believed the butcher was making the commute between Cleveland and New Castle via the boxcar rails, in guise as a transient.  His theory could be supported by the number of victims found in boxcars during the Pennsylvania cycle, and there was a rail that ran one-way between Cleveland and New Castle.  The theory loses weight when you consider that no Cleveland victims were found in boxcars, though this could be that the killer was more comfortable in Cleveland and boxcars proved more reliable in unfamiliar Pennsylvania.  EDIT: Had it mistakenly set as ""between Cleveland and Ohio"" for four days  ii) Third suspect, Willie Johnson.  On June 28, 1942, he took a cab to Kingsbury Run and dumped a trunk under a bridge containing a female torso.  He tossed the arms and head in the bushes, the legs were missing.  The cab driver identified him when a witness described Johnson struggling with the trunk leaving the cab, and he was arrested for the murder of nineteen-year-old prostitute Marie Wilson.  Coroner Gerber visited Johnson before his scheduled 1944 execution, and he denied being the Kingsbury butcher.  He did claim, however, that he did not kill Wilson and that he was paid $25 to carry the body away.  There is no way of knowing if that claim is true or false, or if whoever may have paid him was in any way connected to the 'torso killings' (or if they even existed).  It does mean there may have been a chance that Johnson was wrongfully executed, though.  A lot of similarities in the crime, though even more differences.  The mad butcher never used a trunk to get rid of victims, and nobody ever witnessed any of the dumps.  I definitely could not see the actual killer taking a cab to the dump-site.  Also, if Johnson was the killer, he could not have murdered Robert Robertson in 1950."

Allegedly his girlfriend had left him because of his previous sentences for theft and rape. Later media reports claimed that his enjoyment of robbery, rape and murder was the motive.  While Yang never formally provided a motive, he was quoted as saying:  ""When I killed people I had a desire. This inspired me to kill more. I don't care whether they deserve to live or not.

serialkillers,30y3ni,screenager_,55,Tue Mar 31 18:36:24 2015 UTC,"This is exactly right, in my opinion. Ted loved attention. He knew the guy would keep talking to him if he told him what he wanted to hear.  Even still, those interviews are awesome If you can see through Ted's bullshit."
serialkillers,30y3ni,john_smith1882,39,Tue Mar 31 18:51:20 2015 UTC,"I think it even extends to where Ted was looking for a stay of execution and was willing to spin this bullshit sob story to get it. People often quote this interview to say how evil pornography is, as though a guy whose entire life was a lie is a trusted source."
serialkillers,30y3ni,tanacobus,22,Tue Mar 31 21:44:56 2015 UTC,"I agree. There is one clip (I'll link the page when I find it) Where Ted is asked whether or not he ever buried any victims and he answers something like ""The ones that haven't been found were buried and the ones who have were not""  Almost like he is leading the interviewer to ask him about unsolved murders...  Ted did that routinely in his last years with the DA too, presumably to stay his execution in exchange for deeper confessions.  I believe it was the prosecuting attorney who said Ted's hinting wouldn't work and he just needed to be executed.  Edit: here are the tapes. The dialogue is amazing as well as haunting. I hope (if you haven't heard it already) that you and op /u/midnitetoker87 enjoy the audio!   http://m.kirotv.com/news/news/bundy-confession-tapes-revealed-for-the-first-time/nDrR5/"

serialkillers,30y3ni,Kelfox,6,Wed Apr 1 02:09:10 2015 UTC,"Yep, he knew people would debate it forever."
serialkillers,30y3ni,BlackMantecore,62,Wed Apr 1 04:57:55 2015 UTC,"This was Ann Rule's take on the interview, which I've always found fairly on point:   Two agendas were met with that videotape. Dr. Dobson believed that smut and booze triggered serial killers, and he had the premiere serial killer to validate his theories. Ted wanted to leave behind a legacy of his wisdom and humanity's guilt. He was guilty, yes, but we were guiltier because we allowed pornography to be sold. We walked by newsstands and did not demand that filthy literature be confiscated and outlawed.  I don't think pornography caused Ted Bundy to kill thirty-six or one hundred or three hundred women. I think he became addicted to the power his crimes gave him. And I think he wanted to leave us talking about him, debating the wisdom of his words. In that, he succeeded magnificently.  The blunt fact is that Ted Bundy was a liar. He lied most of his life, and I think he lied at the end.  Ted Bundy's interview with James Dobson accomplished one thing that troubled me. During the weeks after Ted was executed, I heard from a number of young women. Sensitive, intelligent, kind young women wrote or called me to say that they were deeply depressed because Ted was dead. One college student had watched the Dobson tape on television and felt moved to send flowers to the funeral parlor where Ted's body had been taken. ""He wouldn't have hurt me,"" she said. ""All he needed was some kindness. I know he wouldn't have hurt me ...""  Even in death, Ted damages women. They have sent for the Dobson tape, paying the $29.95 fee, and watch it over and over. They see compassion and sadness in his eyes. And they feel guilty and bereft. To get well, they must realize that they were conned by the master conman. They are grieving for a shadow man that never existed."
serialkillers,30y3ni,Psychopath-,20,Tue Mar 31 19:40:01 2015 UTC,Yeah watching the interview he makes himself so relatable and so sympathetic you almost forget that he's a monster. Being so manipulative was what made him such a successful killer though so it's not really that surprising that he comes off almost likeable.
serialkillers,30y3ni,supercantaloupe,11,Tue Mar 31 22:28:42 2015 UTC,He was a master of psychology in the way he knew what people wanted to hear and how they would react to things.
serialkillers,30y3ni,just_cheesin,2,Tue Mar 31 23:30:33 2015 UTC,"I adore Ann Rule, I wish she was my mom. I agree with her take on it too. If he were giving the interview today maybe he'd blame same sex marriage haha"
serialkillers,30y3ni,Plush_Pineapple,5,Mon Apr 6 00:38:14 2015 UTC,"Or he'd blame video games, considering the arguments going on in the gaming world at the moment. This interview is a good reason to always check sources or motives: on the surface it seems like a reasonable interview, until you actually know his backstory and know every word out of his mouth his whole life was a lie."
serialkillers,30y3ni,Overlooker,2,Mon Apr 13 19:02:55 2015 UTC,Well it's pretty convenient that he was giving an interview to Dobson who's Focus of the Family is pretty against pornography lol.
serialkillers,30y3ni,Plush_Pineapple,20,Tue Apr 14 19:39:00 2015 UTC,"i think his sentiments, and this whole interview, was a last ditch effort to get some amount of sympathy before he was executed. maybe he was trying to manipulate his way into getting a death penalty pardon. obviously just my opinion."
serialkillers,30y3ni,dan-paralanguage,3,Tue Mar 31 18:36:22 2015 UTC,"Pretty common theory.  He had his execution postponed several, several times.  He was just trying again to show he held some kind of value to investigators."

serialkillers,30y3ni,RobertsRulesOfHorror,4,Wed Apr 1 15:12:07 2015 UTC,"To me this is the most fascinating thing about the interview: On one hand we know that psychopaths like Bundy are master manipulators on the other hand the man is going to die shortly after the interview, he has no immediate reason to lie. We will probably never really know if he was just bullshitting everybody and not feeling anything or if he really felt remorse and just lost control again and again when drinking alkohol waking up in a nightmare. I think both scenarios  are equally possible. As to the porn thing: He is talking about violent porn and I think somebody with a sadistic tendency might push himself over the edge when fueling his phantasies with that kind of porn."
serialkillers,30y3ni,Flyonz,2,Tue Apr 7 15:04:12 2015 UTC,"Nothing new to say, but nonetheless: Ted Bundy was possibly the most shameless bullshitter who ever lived."
serialkillers,30y3ni,kookydad,2,Wed Apr 1 17:09:38 2015 UTC,"I think they are both playing each other in some kind of sick show and tell to fulfill their given agenda's. Dobson, the hardline conservative with his war on pornography talking to the perfect stooge to back his case. Bundy, who is days away from execution willing to say anything to anybody in the hope of saving his neck."
serialkillers,30y3ni,BrianW1999,2,Sat Apr 11 23:56:52 2015 UTC,What a glorious time to be alive!!!!!
serialkillers,30y3ni,imjustyittle,1 point,Fri Apr 3 23:01:34 2015 UTC,He was lying and trying to manipulate. Bundy was a psychopath and had no remorse whatsoever. His personality disorder meant he couldn't feel remorse. He was just an extremely sick and disturbed psychopath.
serialkillers,30y3ni,TheDerelictWhore,-1,Mon May 4 21:42:25 2015 UTC,"There's not one person here willing to consider that maybe porn affected Bundy differently than it does 'normal' people? Certainly it doesn't excuse his crimes.  Nothing does. And it doesn't explain them by itself. And he was definitely a master manipulator who is undeserving of any empathy.  But I think there's a possibility that porn may have affected Bundy unlike others. Porn was different then, and I don't know if you're taking that into account.  The Playboys & Penthouses were always out of sight, below the counter in sealed cellophane wrappers with opaque blocks covering the 'naughty' parts.  They had to be specifically requested.  If a woman was working the counter, a lot of the time the buyer leave, too shy or embarrassed to ask.  To get something more hardcore than these usually would've required a 'friend' at one of the underground bookstores.   Advertisers didn't show women in the states of undress that you see these days.  People didn't talk about sex openly.  It was a different world in that respect.  Drugs weren't readily available, families ate meals together and went to church together, social problems like  domestic/child abuse generally weren't discussed, even in the media. If they were present in the home, these 'shames' were to be secreted from the rest of the world. Housewives attended PTA meetings, teens protested peacefully against the war, men with long hair were unpatriotic, and porn was kept hidden away, as if it didn't exist.    I'm just saying, maybe Bundy was saying that the fact that sex was considered differently - 'dirtier' - back then enhanced the excitement of the 'forbidden world' to him and unlocked the door to the path he chose to follow."
serialkillers,30y3ni,Soperos,3,Wed Apr 1 10:50:29 2015 UTC,Agree - true crime author Colin Wilson talks quite a bit on this subject of 'the forbidden' and the making of a serial killer in his book The Killers Among Us.  Highly recommended.
serialkillers,30y3ni,imjustyittle,2,Sat Apr 11 07:18:04 2015 UTC,"Completely agree, but everyone was dealing with that so it just circles back to him being a manipulative monster."
serialkillers,30y3ni,Soperos,3,Wed Apr 1 15:14:30 2015 UTC,"Prob so. I was just trying to point out the fact that the context of porn in society was not like it is today, and how Bundy considered it might've been brushed aside too easily.  His manipulation is of particular interest to me, and I think, had he continued working within the governor and the RNC, he could've had a very successful career in politics."
serialkillers,30y3ni,Throwaway43416,4,Thu Apr 2 08:13:36 2015 UTC,Absolutely. A master manipulator + politics = any successful politcian.
serialkillers,30y3ni,imjustyittle,2,Thu Apr 2 19:23:55 2015 UTC,"Why were men with long hair considered unpatriotic? And, I know he was lying when he said ""it's still hard to talk about"" but I really doubt porn had THAT much effect on him. It might've pushed him a little but I think he's exaggerating it a lot."
serialkillers,30y3ni,fox100,3,Thu Apr 2 01:59:57 2015 UTC,"I should add ""by conservatives"" re the unpatriotic image.  Stereotypical image of the draft dodgers who fled to Canada to  avoid serving in the military was weed-smoking young men with long, unkempt hair, flag as part of clothing, sideburns, mustache. Even theological reasons for not serving (""conscientious objector"" status) were considered unpatriotic by many of the over-thirties."
serialkillers,30ztic,Strigoix6,14,Wed Apr 1 00:42:47 2015 UTC,"Bundy, hands down. It's amazing to think that he'd fooled pretty much everyone he'd ever met up until the moment he was caught, but it's even more horrifying to read accounts of how people (including the jury) were absolutely charmed by him and even still refused to believe that he could do such things. Someone once described him as just being a void with a nice smile, and I think that's the perfect description for the man. Just pure, unrepentant evil."

The book perfectly intertwines the facts of the case with her personal dealings with him. ie, the would leave the hotline office really late and he would walk her to her car to keep her safe. shiver"

serialkillers,30ztic,ArchHero,8,Mon May 4 21:43:46 2015 UTC,"Besides Albert Fish, BTK. He installed home intruder alarms into the homes of people who wanted them, because of him. That wasn't the most disturbing part. He went to college, was a boy scout leader, was the president of a church council. That's disturbing in it's own way, because of how normal those things are. In my opinion, his most disturbing kill was of the Otereo family. Especially the little girl. He tied her up, and masturbated to her suffocating.   I know you said one, but as far as sexual sadists Paul Bernardo is the scariest type of serial rapist. He killed some women too."
serialkillers,30ztic,rissaro0o,7,Fri Apr 3 05:06:19 2015 UTC,"Sorry, guys, pretty late to the darn party. I think the most disturbing serial killers are the ones we don't even know about. They've been saying that serial murders have been decreasing because police work has gotten better and so has technology. But have they ever stopped to think that maybe that's making the killers better, too? I bet there are SO MANY serial killers out there who have never been caught, some taking those secrets to the grave... People who are soooo good at blending in, so good at hiding or dissolving bodies, experts at stalking and luring the perfect victims, experts at appearing so normal and average that their own families have absolutely no inkling that their loved one could be a cold, unfeeling killer. Better technology for crime solving has DRASTICALLY improved, but what about all the crime shows we watch that basically give you a complete handbook on ""how to evade the police and leave absolutely no forensic data behind"". But as far as the ones who have been caught, I think Richard Ramirez, the Night Stalker, is terrifying. He just looks the part, so evil and scary."
serialkillers,30ztic,QiaoYu,2,Tue Apr 7 17:08:51 2015 UTC,I definitely agree with you about the most disturbing being the ones we haven't caught yet.

serialkillers,30xort,sheep_for_sale,1 point,Tue Mar 31 17:30:39 2015 UTC,Did they believe dahmer was his father or something?
serialkillers,30xort,terrymcginnisbeyond,3,Tue Mar 31 22:26:16 2015 UTC,I looked this up a little deeper.  The officers thought he was his boyfriend (Dahmer was gay).  One of the officers actually won an award after this.  Witnesses heard the officers say something along the lines of 'two love birds reunited'.
serialkillers,30xort,sheep_for_sale,3,Tue Mar 31 22:31:09 2015 UTC,Did they forcefully reunite them? Cause if I was the kid I'd start running from the cops too
serialkillers,30xort,EvarArts,9,Tue Mar 31 22:34:40 2015 UTC,"Yes they forced him, and he was seriously injured.  Here's an excerpt from murderpedia it has sources and I can back it up from my own bookshelf as accurate.  In the early morning hours of May 27, 1991, 14-year-old Konerak Sinthasomphone (the younger brother of the boy whom Dahmer had molested in 1988) was discovered on the street, wandering naked, heavily under the influence of drugs and bleeding from his rectum. Two young women from the neighborhood found the dazed boy and called 911. Dahmer chased his victim down and tried to take him away, but the women stopped him. Dahmer told John Balcerzak and Joseph Gabrish, police officers dispatched to the scene, that Sinthasomphone was his 19-year-old boyfriend, and that they had an argument while drinking. Against the protests of the two women who had called 911, who recognized him from the neighborhood and insisted that he was a child and couldn't speak English, the officers turned him over to Dahmer. They later reported smelling a strange scent while inside Dahmer's apartment, but did not investigate it. The smell was the body of Tony Hughes, Dahmer's previous victim, decomposing in the bedroom. The officers did not make any attempt to verify Sinthasomphone's age or identity, nor locate someone who could communicate with him, and failed to run a background check that would have revealed Dahmer being a convicted child molester still under probation. Later that night, Dahmer killed and dismembered Sinthasomphone, keeping his skull as a souvenir."
serialkillers,30xort,florbat,5,Tue Mar 31 22:41:00 2015 UTC,"I've always felt there was some serious anti-gay prejudice influencing the officers' conduct. The passage could have read, ""The officers did not make any attempt to verify Sinthasomphone's age or identity, nor locate someone who could communicate with him, because fuck him, he's gay, who wants to deal with that shit? Better to just make a joke about lovebirds reunited and drive off.""   The kid was naked, bleeding, and unable to communicate. Does anything else matter? Be cops and do something you fucking pieces of shit."
serialkillers,30xort,autowikibot,4,Wed Apr 1 17:22:39 2015 UTC,I think there's no doubt the officers were homophobic and likely had no idea how to deal with domestic violence either.  It's still an issue in police forces today but less so than 20+ years ago.

Eventually they brought him in on a totally unrelated charge (out of date tax disc on his car) and found out the rest of the info then, after he'd been free to kill a whole lot more women.

But you really have to like know once you're older IT IS NOT OKAY TO KILL PEOPLE! And like yeah, your life was potentially fucked up, but you can only blame that to a very certain extent.   I just wish there wasn't such a stigma on mental illness because I feel like so many people who need real help are so ashamed or unable to receive it because of stigma, money, etc. I just wonder how many live could be saved (both victims and perpetrators) if the world was a little kinder when it comes to helping mentally ill people. Serial killers are obviously very fucked and are definitely aware of what they're doing, because they hide it (and all that shit), but I wonder if we could save them. There are plenty of people who suffer from antisocial personality disorder or lack of empathy, but they don't kill. They may do bad things (they say lots of big CEO's and business executives may have symptoms of psychopathy) but not take lives or torture people. I wonder what society could do if mental illness testing was done for all children in schools (unrealistic, but whatevs)."

The remains of four victims were found in December 2010, while six more sets of remains were found in March and April 2011.    Police believe that the latest sets of remains predate the four bodies found in December 2010.   On May 9, 2011, authorities surmised that two of the newest sets of remains might be the work of a second killer.  On November 29, 2011, however, the police announced that they believe that one person is responsible for all 10 deaths and that they do not believe that the case of Shannan Gilbert (see below) is related.

(Can't remember the source on this, read in one of the many books I've read on this case)  I think Rader was just starting to slip.  He was getting old.  He was not an idiot and not even particularly stupid about tech in his heyday.  He knew enough to cut off the edges of his Xeroxed letters to remove identifying marks, and to use multiple copiers to obfuscate the origin of his letters.  Then this newfangled computer technology comes along and he thinks he's got a grasp on it which he obviously didn't.  Additionally, he had been hiding out and laying low for so long I'm sure he craved the attention he was getting by coming back ""out of retirement,"" so to speak.  I imagine that made him less cautious than he should have been with the disk strategy.  The cops didn't think they would get anything from the disk beforehand, actually.  They figured best case scenario it would lead them to a public library somewhere in the city.  Just so happened to lead them to a Dennis at the Christ Lutheran Church.  Quick google search showed that a Dennis Rader was on the leadership board and that was it for BTK.  I hope he has lots of time to think about it while he rots in solitary confinement."

If you look at the state numbers, it’s not surprising.  Since the reinstatement of the death penalty in 1976, California has executed 13 people. California has 745 prisoners on death row.  Ted Bundy was executed in Florida. Florida has executed 90 people since 1976, and has 404 prisoners on death row.  It is pretty clear that California is a state that does no longer want to execute criminals.  In fact, a very small handful of states are still keen on execution, with Texas alone accounting for over one third of all executions since 1976.  A lot of state electorates seem to still want the death penalty on the books, but it seems that they’re less ""tough"" when it comes to going through with the actual killing of human beings.

That being said, his MO, psychology, and criminal history- as well as circumstantial evidence and statements made by individuals who knew him and were sometimes involved peripherally in his other crimes- all lend credence to the hypothesis of Ray as serial killer.

serialkillers,30ijwm,Psychopath-,6,Fri Mar 27 23:00:17 2015 UTC,"No idea. No idea if they even used a drug cocktail or if that's just something they told the captives during their confinement to make them more compliant by leading them to believe they were only waiting on their eventual release when the plan was to kill them all along.  The captive who got him caught escaped, so that doesn't help- but... these girls lived at this house for weeks or months, interacting with Ray and his girlfriend and his daughter and his neighbors/accomplices. With how safe and careful Ray was about everything else, letting the captives- witnesses- leave alive just seems uncharacteristically risky. Add that to the fact that most evidence points to Ray being a prolific kidnapper and yet almost entirely unsuspected until his sole arrest after his last victim escaped, it all points to a rather cynical view of how likely it was that the majority of his captives had their memories skillfully wiped at such a successful rate that Ray was able to continue his crimes unscathed and his victims released into the world alive with no recollection of their ordeal."

It was believed that the ripper had anatomical knowledge, but not the kind that a surgeon or real medical professional would yield (like maybe she just had read his text books or learned second hand).  Her husband was a suspect because he had connections with more than one victim.  There were female clothes found burned in Mary Kelley's fireplace that didn't belong to her.

We'll never have a good accounting of all the citizens on the east end at the time.  How often are serial killers a well-know member of the community in the modern era?  How often are they even considered suspects before they are caught?    It happens, sure, but more often than not it's a stroke of luck or a mistake that brings the killer to the police's attention.  After that it's just a matter of making sure they fit the rest of the evidence and you put them away.  That's never going to happen in the Jack the Ripper case.  He was probably just some guy, working a job, maybe with a wife and kids.  Perhaps he was sent away for another crime, perhaps he died, perhaps he just stopped (seems unlikely, but it's happened before).    This is like the Zodiac case but even deeper into the past.

There were a few Ripper like cases in the US around the time Holmes returned to the US.  Mudgett also says he is in possession of a diary written by Holmes that also alludes to him being the Ripper.  I am not sure if he ever released those publicly or not.  I am guessing not.

For the record, I have never read that dude's book.  I just heard him a few years back on some True Crime podcast.    Truth is, likely we will never know who the Ripper was.  The same suspects will cycle through as the favorite suspect every time a new book comes out.  I also think most people involved in the case prefer the case is never solved.  Books, movies, tourism, etc.   That mystery generates a lot of money for a lot of people."

Maybe that is why he is the one I find the most fascinating.

Could have been more than one person.  Could have been evolution/change based on necessity, or something else.    I think the thing that stands out to me, despite the difference in MO is the selling of organs/body parts.  Having said that, during that time, I am sure that sort of thing was not that uncommon.    Someone else mentioned a book that kinda squashes this theory.  I would like to read it sometime.  Might make me dismiss the idea totally."
serialkillers,30fh03,Stucifer2,3,Fri Mar 27 23:26:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it could be.  The progressively worse violence to me indicates someone that couldn't control themselves and wouldn't have been able to stop unless made to.    I've posted this elsewhere, but the best thing I've read on the Ripper case was written by John Douglas in his book, The Cases that Haunt Us.  He thinks the killer was committed to an insane asylum and that's why the killings stopped.  He believes the person was insane and was locked up for reasons independent of the killings.  I find this theory much more believable than the exotic theories of murderers who were part of the royal family, etc."

After his arrest in 1990 police found photographs that Black had taken of himself: one showed him with a wine-bottle up his anus, another with a telephone-handset, yet another with a table leg.

She basically was a bored housewife who decided to play detective on a local murder case. She has been playing profiler ever since.

serialkillers,30cw6p,JustTryingToMaintain,18,Thu Mar 26 10:07:39 2015 UTC,"I have actually researched this using nonpsychopathic participants! Psychopaths do have what we call affective poverty,  they fail to make facial expressions, make any body language nonpsychopathic people do. I can only speak a little to facial expressions as my research did not include body language and other facets of affective poverty. Lots of research has indicated that psychopaths cannot recognize and properly interpret facial expressions in others. In my research, I found that empathy was largely involved with the ability to recognize facial expressions in others. Largely, empathy occurs in the prefrontal cortex which has been shown to be severely dysfunctional in psychopathic individuals. So if recognition of facial expressions in others are, in some part, related to ability to empathize, it is likely that a psychopath's inability to empathize may inhibit his/her ability to recognize and even make normal facial expressions.  I believe their affective poverty is due largely to the neurological deficits characteristic of psychopathy,  not necessarily any medication they may be on. Anti-psychotic medication can,  in some cases, produce flat affective behavior, but psychopaths have this flat affect before they are treated so it is not likely caused by the medication alone."

They have to learn how to do it correctly, and consciously, to look normal. What do you mean by they can't recognize facial expressions?"
serialkillers,30cw6p,Throwaway43416,3,Fri Mar 27 02:51:31 2015 UTC,"So there are six universal facial expressions: neutral,  happy, sad, fear, anger, and surprise. When researchers show images of these facial expressions to individuals who scored high in the PCL-R do not recognize these facial expressions. They don't see the emotion in the other person's face. By not recognize, I mean to say that they cannot correctly identify that the Duchenne smile means that a person is happy, that the person is sad or angry or afraid. They can no identify these emotions and cannot recognize facial expressions in others. So it is likely then that the inability to recognize facial expressions in others affects or is linked to their poverty in their own affect."
serialkillers,30cw6p,11023517141,3,Fri Mar 27 03:01:36 2015 UTC,I wonder the IQ range of the test subjects. I'm sure the smarter serial killers could recognize facial expressions
serialkillers,30cw6p,Throwaway43416,4,Fri Mar 27 03:05:34 2015 UTC,"It is definitely possible! I would not put it past a highly intelligent psychopath to learn the particularly facial muscle contractions necessary for particular facial expressions (I.e. the Duchenne smile, two contractions total, one on either corner of the lips and the outer corners of the eyes,  etc.). Unfortunately,  IQ tests are extremely standardized (read:flawed) and take several hours to complete with the constant guidance and supervision of a trained specialist who is licensed to administer the test, so testing the IQ's of these individuals, even in future research, is unlikely. Besides, a psychopath who has a high enough IQ to fake the recognition of facial expressions also has a high enough IQ to figure out how to get a low score on the PCL-R and will then be excluded from the study all together. :)"
serialkillers,30cw6p,11023517141,2,Fri Mar 27 03:16:34 2015 UTC,"That's really interesting! I'm curious to know if current research indicates any treatment beyond medication that could help repair the prefrontal cortex in psychopaths or other people will mental/neurological illness possibly related to that area such as Autism, Schizophrenia, or Bipolar?    Also, many people with mental illnesses have affective poverty-has science narrowed down the difference between say, someone on the Autism spectrum that has trouble recognizing people's facial expressions/emotions/social gestures, with a psychopath suffering from similar issues but seemingly capable of recognizing what is going on socially in a way that Autistics can't?"
serialkillers,30cw6p,11023517141,5,Thu Mar 26 22:12:17 2015 UTC,"So with autism, research has shown that the inability to recognize facial expressions is due to a complete lack of mirror neurons. Mirror neurons are the ones that help us to mimick other's behaviors and are absolutely crucial in social learning. Most of our learning actually comes through the observation of others. If you want to  activate a friend's, SO's, etc. mirror neurons, simply ask them to copy you doing some physical behavior such as waving, standing on one leg, etc. There is no research to date examining the mirror neurons of psychopathic individuals, though some have made the connection between psychopathy and autism as you have just done, saying that it is most similar to the severe neurological deficits we as in autism and also severely affects their social behavior. When I say no research, I mean to say that examing the function of mirror neurons in psychopaths, is on my bucketlist, and I will report back here as soon as I can get a few psychopaths to volunteer.  :)   Currently, there is no neurological treatment for psychopathy. I am not sure about autism, schizophrenia,  and bipolar. The biggest treatment with the latter three is a combination of medication and therapy. Therapy is pretty much totally ineffective on violent,  sexual psychopaths.   By the way, if anybody is interested in the research articles from which I've gathered the information (I cannot give you mine because I would like to remain anonymous) even the background information I used on facial expressions, just PM me and I'd be glad to send them in an email! I love reading them and they really help shed light on what's going on in somebody like Bundy and Gein and Wuornos' brains."
serialkillers,30cw6p,jewdiful,5,Fri Mar 27 02:14:08 2015 UTC,"I think it's partly due to their lack of normal human emotions... non-psychopaths feel a variety of different emotions, can pick up on the emotions of others, responding to and even mirroring them sometimes.

I always lean toward the belief that people massively over-diagnose the people around them as a coping mechanism - we don't want to believe that certain things are within the normal range of human behavior.  That said, your friend sounds like my ex, and while I'm quite reluctant to pull the ""GOD MY EX WAS A PSYCHOPATH"" card for a number of reasons, that coldness resonates. He was horrifyingly vacant even when making endearing, twee gestures (shit you'd see frontpaging on r/aww or r/all, of the awkward gamer-hipster variety) and would erupt then follow me around the house screaming if I didn't make a point of showering him with praise for anything he did. But the screaming was eerily mechanical, and I noticed over the course of a couple years that he behaved like a perfect learning algorithm - phrases or words that I reacted to particularly strongly would immediately go up in frequency or, conversely, vanish from the lexicon as soon as they stopped having an effect on me.  He knew I had PTSD from childhood sexual abuse and would have catatonic episodes when severely triggered, and would use this have sex with me without consent and lie about it ever happening even though there was pretty concrete physical evidence, if you know what I mean. I don't really want to elaborate.  He had a very PHIL 101 understanding of ethics. Doing anything nice for someone without getting anything in return, where he could see it, would result in ""You're trying to make me feel bad"" and ""Everybody is selfish anyway so why are you putting on airs"".  The only time I really felt like he displayed genuine frustration or sadness was when he didn't get the attention he felt he deserved in a particular setting. He once went to a work party shortly after starting at a job (which involved a pretty drastic career change) and came home LIVID that people had only asked him a total of two questions about himself the whole time.  I think that kind of narcissism and callousness is easy to feel but hard to name and put your finger on without sounding crazy, but I do not doubt that we walk around and interact with some horrible, horrible people without ever knowing it."

He had this other thing going on, where he would feign appreciation or politeness, but he was bullshitting. To us - my other dorky friends and I - it was pretty transparent. I guess we had seen so much of his repugnant, narcissistic behavior and thinking that to us, that was who he was at his core. I'm maybe not doing such a great job explaining this. Let me put it this way; for five or so years he was the Eddie Haskell of my house. My mother thought he was the nicest boy in the world. He had several of our teachers snowed too.

It was more like a property dispute. I BELONGED to him and he DESERVED to ""own"" me, so to speak. It was creepy as all fuck. The kids too. He never saw them again after I left, regardless of how much I begged, but when my husband wanted to adopt them he said ""no. Those are MY kids."" and still refused to come see them. Eerie.

serialkillers,309yif,JustTryingToMaintain,13,Sat Mar 28 00:18:13 2015 UTC,Hindsight's a fucking bitch.
serialkillers,309yif,surethingsugar,8,Wed Mar 25 20:40:25 2015 UTC,"Yes, I am about 95% sure my father has committed at least two(but these are just the ones I know about) acts of extreme violence, always purposefully involving fire and from what I can piece together basically locking/securing people in their homes from the outside in such a way that they can not escape the fire.  The people(at least the ones I know of) that I believe he did this to all managed to come out of the fire with their lives but SEVERELY disfigured and paralyzed(two of the four were left in wheelchairs and died relatively young as a result of their injuries and the last two were very young men in their early 20s who were forced to move into a nursing home care facility for the rest of their lives-those two may also be in wheelchairs, I don't know).  I have desperately tried to convince myself it's just a coincidence but I'm pretty fucking sure it's isn't.   Of the four victims I know of both incidents happened two victims at a time. The first pair of men to get in a suspicious fire that left them in wheelchairs for the rest of their lives were widely suspected to have been the murderers of my Uncle Billy(*name changed for privacy reasons) who happened to be my father's best friend at the time and also my Uncle Billy was how my dad met mom years before.  The murder of my uncle Billy was never solved and I fear my father decided to take matters into his own hands. This whole incident occurred only when I was about two or three years old and since I was raised by my grandparents(Uncle Billy's mom) it had been widely viewed as a simple karma type thing but with a figurative wink at times.  The second time I am aware of is years later: My sibling and I had moved states to live with my father. There was a particular ongoing incident with a violent, many years older than me or my sibling(he had failed a lot of grades) male bully and the bully's brother who eventually ran off the bus at our bus stop and pushed me down in our yard, humiliated my sibling and I in front of the whole school bus of kids watching, threatened to kill me and told us we ""better make sure you lock your doors really well every night"".  When I told my father he was quietly furious and at one point weeks later in reference to the bullying situation he said to me ""JustTryingToMaintain, the hardest things for cops to prove in life are arson and murder. Don't ever tell anyone I said that.""  and he never mentioned it again. Fast forward a bit and I had turned 18 yrs old, moved out and completely cut off all contact with my father(though my sibling remained close to him). I had literally not spoken one word to him and refused to accept any xmas or bday gifts he tried to send me via my sibling. Then I'm about 24 and my sibling informs me that the two brother bullies had been in a suspicious house fire recently in which they'd been trapped inside their burning home with no means of escape and that as a result they were both now horribly disfigured and had to live in a care home for the rest of their lives. The police never solved how the fire came to be and the bully brothers either can't physically talk or will not physically talk about it. Oddly, about 6-8 months after the fire involving the two brothers that had bullied me my father found out the hotel I was staying at in town while visiting my sibling and called me ""to apologize(for unrelated abuse he had done to me) and hope that he could be in my life again"" my response was simply ""We all make choices. You made yours and I'm making mine. My life is better without you in it and never forget that."" then I hung up and haven't heard from him again.   More evidence:  1) Back when my sibling and I were living with him and trying to get to know him after years of never exchanging letters or getting calls while living with my grandparents I asked him if he had any pets as a child.  He said yes he had one pet cat...it's name was ""horn ears"".  When I asked why it was named horn ears he said(while chuckling) that the cat's ears had been burned off to nubs and that the only remaining parts stuck out like little devil horns. When asked who did that or why they'd do that he said he did not know.   2) When I was a still a toddler and my parents were still together they got me a pet kitten which I loved dearly. One day the pet kitten was somehow lost and when it was found the next day in our front yard someone had wrapped the entire kitten's body in duct tape except it's head sticking out. The kitten was still alive but I don't recall how the situation was dealt with- if the duct tape was somehow removed-and if so then how?-(which I doubt) or if the kitten was killed.I know we didn't take it to the vet. Another kitten(perhaps as a replacement kitten for the first) was given to me but just a few short months after I got it my father ""accidentally"" ran over and killed it on his way to work one morning. I feel however that the kitten incident COULD have been my mother's doing rather than my father(though, it could have been him or even some random prank from mean kids?). My mom later ended up killing her bf that she and I were living with at the time, going to prison for it for only 4.5 years and when she got out of prison and moved my sibling and I back into her home I came home from school one day to learn that she had ""accidentally"" murdered my pet hermit crab by ripping him out of his shell because she thought it was time to move him to a bigger shell. She said she had already buried him and showed me a place outside that did look like a possible burial site.  Noteworthy: My mother was only around(but so was my dad for all except the hermit crab killing) during the two kitten incidents and not around for the fire incidents or my father's childhood ""horn ears""cat incident.  I have a bit more circumstantial evidence on my dad but have always battled what to do with it as it was mostly extreme vigilante justice in the face of our family being marginalized by the legit justice system, plus it happened between 10-30 years ago and by my sibling's account he has mellowed out a lot with age.   SO- do you guys think he is guilty and to what extent? Did my mom or dad hurt my kittens as a child or is that unrelated? If my dad IS guilty should I report him to the police thereby ruining his life and more importantly, effecting the life of my only sibling whom I love very much?"
serialkillers,309yif,JustTryingToMaintain,5,Wed Mar 25 20:53:12 2015 UTC,That's terrifying.   Hard to say if your dad was involved. People who make enemies tend to make a lot of them.
serialkillers,309yif,returningvideotapess,2,Thu Mar 26 01:55:50 2015 UTC,"But for such specific scenarios to happen both times(4 different grown men locked into a burning house, cases never solved) and it just so happens my father has an ax to grind with each of them and was in the area at the time? Plus what he said when it was just him and I in the car and I was complaining about the bullies?  ""Remember ----(justtryingtomaintain), arson and murder are the hardest things in the world for a cop to prove."" Plus the story of his childhood cat with the ears burned down to nubs that he laughed as he told us about? And he used to do a kind of trick with his lighter when I was little- he would have the flame going and hover his hand over it in such a way as to basically push the flame away from his hand and not get burned himself but then he would make it a ""game"" which I never wanted to play where he would hold my hand over the flame just enough to burn it slightly and then laugh and laugh about it and say I wasn't very good at that game. He has always been a violent man and he's always been fascinated by fire.    I'm just trying to make up my mind if he really did those things and if he did do them(I'm pretty sure he did) what, if anything, I should do from a moral/ethical standpoint.  I will say that I don't think my dad is likely to do any of those things again but it's simply due to his advanced age and if someone were to offend his ego enough I wouldn't put it past him. The first two men he (may have) done that to was in retribution for my uncle's murder-but the men were never brought up on charges and innocent in the eyes of the law and perhaps were truly 100% innocent and suffered for a crime they didn't commit.  As for the two brothers who bullied my sibling and I-if my dad had not moved us straight into the ghetto then that whole situation could have been avoided...and though the bullies were scary and awful other than emotionally humiliate me and stress me out all one of them did was push me down hard on the ground one time while his brother simply watched approvingly. Did they deserve to have their teeth knocked down their throat? Fuck yeah! But they didn't deserve to be trapped in their house as it burnt almost to the ground and to spend their lives from about age 22 most likely until the day they die in a nursing home type place so they can have their ongoing skin/scarring issues attended to.    It's just confusing because I don't think my dad(if he did these things) did them out of love for my uncle(his best friend at the time) or out of love for my sibling and I...I think he did them because he likes to hurt people and also as some sort of ego thing.  It makes me wonder if he has done other things like that to other people for even lesser offenses."
serialkillers,309yif,JustTryingToMaintain,1 point,Thu Mar 26 03:54:00 2015 UTC,Have you looked into the crimes? read police reports or anything? I wonder if you could learn anything from that.. does he have a criminal record?
serialkillers,309yif,Felixthegreyhound,1 point,Thu Mar 26 08:50:02 2015 UTC,"He has an extensive criminal record, as does my mother. I haven't looked into the crimes because they were in small towns and it would draw suspicion just by me looking."
serialkillers,309yif,returningvideotapess,0,Thu Mar 26 16:43:12 2015 UTC,If he really has mellowed out.. go talk to him...?
serialkillers,309yif,JustTryingToMaintain,4,Thu Mar 26 21:54:52 2015 UTC,"No way will I ever talk to him. He can mellow out all he wants but he'll be doing it without me. I'm at about 12 years and counting without talking to him and my life is better because of that.  People like him never actually change, they are never actually sorry...they say whatever they need to say in the moment and IF they even meant it when they said it their conditioning soon comes out and things revert right back to how they were the moment you start to relax.  He may have ""mellowed out"" in the sense that he's probably too old to be into the arson/attempted murder thing anymore but he was a shitty father and a horrible human being and there's no way I'm allowing that kinda drama back into my life."

serialkillers,309yif,returningvideotapess,2,Tue Mar 31 13:49:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the support. Too often well meaning people tell me to ""patch things up"" with my mom and dad because I happen to be white and well groomed-they just assume it's because I'm mad about something trivial. They have no clue what my mom and dad are like. My mom is a convicted murderer, prostitute, petty thief and drug/alcohol addict. My dad is a *suspected murderer, convicted arsonist, serial woman beater, horribly abusive drunk, and we had to give the family dog(a lil pug) away because he literally kicked it until it shit on itself and we were worried he'd kill it. I am looked at as the fuck up of the family and everyone hates me for some reason so I just learned to cut them all out of my life."
serialkillers,309yif,PM_me_a_scary_thing,5,Thu Mar 26 16:08:53 2015 UTC,"That's horrible advice. I don't think they do mellow out. I have a relative that I cut off 20 years ago and about every 3-4 years she'll call someone to try to get my number and tell them she wants to reconcile. I've learned that this is a tactic to get me back into a situation where she can victimize me. She is not sorry, she is merely saying those words to try to manipulate me into contact. Maybe his dad is truly sorry, maybe. Even though, you can't trust those types with anything, especially your life. They get it in their head that they are owed something, and they're going to make you pay. It's better to cut off all contact and hope they just move on to someone else, unless you have any kind of evidence and then you should call the cops and hope they help you."
serialkillers,309yif,returningvideotapess,2,Thu Mar 26 22:00:38 2015 UTC,"You're generalizing everyone based on your experience. People fuck up. Some parents are really lousy. SOME people learn from their mistakes, mature, mellow to the point that they are able to be good parents, friends, people. If you cut out every single person that's ever made a mistake in your life you'll be pretty lonely.   I'm not recommending anyone be a doormat but part of being a mature adult is letting stuff go and accepting people."
serialkillers,309yif,gabrielsburg,2,Thu Mar 26 09:59:42 2015 UTC,In all fairness just because the relative you cut off isn't maturing doesn't mean no one in the Universe will ever grow or mature. If OPs siblings feel the guy is mellowing out why not make a phone call? OP sounds like an intelligent enough person to be able to figure out if the guy is still whacked.. and if he is he can hang up. And if not perhaps they can build a better relationship.   Nothing to lose.
serialkillers,309yif,MooingInFear,3,Thu Mar 26 16:48:44 2015 UTC,"Perhaps my reply was too extreme. I just get tired of people telling me to give people another chance when they have no idea what went on and what the deal is. It's possible that at 3am I was taking the whole thing in the wrong way. OP seems to know exactly what they want to do though, you're right. It just seems they made it clear that they do not feel it is a good time to reconnect and then someone being like ""meh, do it anyway"" just seemed really disrespectful and potentially dangerous."
serialkillers,309yif,gabrielsburg,2,Thu Mar 26 16:04:28 2015 UTC,I didn't see OPs reply to mine before I replied to yours either.. but I totally understand. No one knows what anyone's situation is really like. We all have our own baggage and issues and history and life experiences that make us who we are and we need to be respectful of that.   Thank you for your kind reply.. it's refreshing to see that here ;-)
serialkillers,309yif,Ayn_Rand_Was_Right,6,Thu Mar 26 18:07:01 2015 UTC,"Interesting question.  My best answer unfortunately is maybe.  After my divorce my ex-wife started dating this guy she met through a friend -- we knew him vaguely while we were together.  My ex and I have two kids (two boys) and this guy had two of his own (boy and a girl, both older than my kids by about 7 or 8 years).  Unfortunately, they'd spent most of their lives quite badly off economically and their mother had left them early on in their lives with pretty much no interest in the children.  So he was left to raise them the best he could manage on a largely empty bank account.  Poor nutrition.  Poor social skills.  Bad habits.  On the surface it just adds up to kids with lesser life prospects.  Then came suspicions that this guy's son was starting to learn towards mean and possible sexually abusive behavior towards my youngest boy.  Nothing concrete, but there were hints.  Talking to ex from time to time, we'd openly wonder if our kids were actually safe being in the same house alone with this boy.  Thankfully, that was never an issue.  There were also some questions about whether or not he was treating the dog well.  On top of that the kid was pretty much reviled at school.  Seen as a loser, he was picked on a lot, generally ostracized by the other kids.  He did not help himself much either.  He was particularly ridiculed after a project for one of his classes that I won't go into the details of, but I will categorize as being, for lack of a better word, pathetic.  It earned him more teasing.  If I recall correctly, his only ""friend"" was a kid that was a bit younger than him which he had a penchant for bullying.  Meanwhile, he started to act out a bit.  At 13 he was still having the kind of writhing, hysterical tantrums you'd expect of a toddler.  And mixed in to all this was suggestions of his attitudes towards women -- a kind of blankness that felt like he viewed them as ""things.""  The only stable woman in his life had been his older sister and she had her own barrel of problems.  Personally, I always felt a bit uneasy about this boy and when my ex-wife finally broke up with the kid's dad, I told her she was lucky, saying something alone the lines of, ""Good, I feel like you were on the trajectory to becoming a chapter in the true crime book someone would write about him a decade or two from now.""  Of course, none of this is definitive.  But it was a concern.  He might just grow up to be a loner.  He may grow up to be just an asshole.  Or someone might make a positive connection in his life.  Or he may decide to assuage some inner demons in other more horrible ways.  I don't know.  TL;DR: the kid had been picked on most of his life and showed some suspect behavioral patterns and attitudes towards others, particularly women."

I was a snarky, horror-obsessed, outcast teenage boy, so obviously if anyone's going to start stashing bodies in a crawlspace it's me.   For extra fun I had the privilege of being in college when the entire mainstream media decided to blame the Columbine Massacre on first-person shooters, Marilyn Manson, and KMFDM.

serialkillers,309yif,mafoo,3,Thu Mar 26 13:59:23 2015 UTC,"First of all both of his parents are mentally ill. My aunt has been in an institution for the better part of 20 years as a diagnosed schizophrenic.  As such, both of my cousins were raised by my grandmother. Both of my cousins have since been diagnosed with mental issues that made them act up in their youth, but the cousin I'm talking about was significantly worse. He would hit my grandma and scream at her if she said no to him. He always fought violently with his brother over small things, and would scream horrible threats in this crazed voice. He never had any friends because of his temper. He also has this look in his eyes where you can see he isn't really there. It's really unsettling.   After my grandma died, my cousins had to move in with us. My cousin was depressed and would threaten to hurt himself and others. At this time he was 12. He wouldn't listen to anyone, especially women. He neglected his dog, his hygiene, and his grades and he'd have violent outbursts if you questioned him.   Things got worse when he fell for a girl he worked with when he was 17. He couldn't understand why she wouldn't leave her boyfriend for him, and he started developing attitudes toward women similar to the worst people over at TheRedPill. He wrote in his journal that he would dismember the girl and her boyfriend if she wouldn't go out with him. He started dressing like her boyfriend and adopting his mannerisms. When they broke up, he tried to convince her to start dating him. She declined. He went home and stabbed himself over 30 times. He didn't scream. He just stood there bleeding. He ended up going to a mental health center for young people and seemed to be recovering. It turned out he just told the doctors what they wanted to hear to get out faster. As such, the diagnosis he received can't be accurate.   He got out and moved back into the house, celebrating his 18th birthday. He wouldn't talk to us anymore. The only thing he cared about was the girl he liked while in the facility. He said she was a stupid whore for not adding him on Facebook or returning his calls. One night my stepmom asked him to clean his room. He let it get to the point where dirty dishes and old food sat there rotting, and his dog would shit on the floor because he refused to take him out. He'd let the shit lay there. Instead of cleaning his room, he pulled a knife on her. He waved it around in her face. When she was able to grab it and restrain him, he pushed her off and stabbed himself dozens of times with dull kitchen scissors. He still didn't scream. He ran out of the house and hid in a bush until the police found him.  He ended up spending a year in a facility, but instead of moving into a halfway house, he moved in with his brother. My dad refuses to take him in. He's not on any medication and he's not enrolled in therapy. He claims he acted out because my dad and stepmom ""abused"" him. They never once abused him. He thought having any rules was abusive. Even today he has frequent outbursts. He's also taken to Facebook where he frequently posts stuff about how women are whores and have no feelings, and that he's going to treat women like shit because ""that's what they want"". He had a girlfriend for a few months and he micromanaged her life, and would belittle her for having different viewpoints than him. He forced her to denounce her religion, for example. I'm guessing he did worse things than that because she told everyone that he was a horrible boyfriend and now no women from school will date him or talk to him.   I'm afraid for the next girl. I'm afraid he'll end up moving in with a girl and she'll end up dead after an argument. I'm scared he'll kill himself. He terrifies me. I can't look in his eyes because they just look dead and uncaring. I don't speak to him anymore because he has obvious problems with women because of one girl that turned him down. He's hit me and criticized me for things that shouldn't even matter. He's toxic, and I wouldn't be surprised if I got a call that he killed his brother, his brother's girlfriend, and himself."

It must be so frustrating knowing that this person needs help and is likely a danger to himself and others but being basically powerless to help.   In highschool I was friends with three brothers - the youngest being one of my best friends. His eldest brother is schizophrenic. It was devastating seeing someone so intelligent and witty crumble into a delusional mess. Last time I saw him he looked at me and said ""I blame you for all my problems.""  I did nothing to him that would warrant a statement and it scared me. I haven't seen him since - although I drove by his mothers house last thanksgiving to see if anyone was around and he was standing on the front porch. I kept driving knowing he wouldn't recognize my parents car. What I am trying to say is I understand the fear and frustration.  My mothers family is thankfully devoid of mental illness issues. My father is adopted so who knows - I could come from a family with a long line of mental illness. I have thought about it and thanked the universe that I seem to be sane. I can't imagine the darkness of being trapped in my own broken mind.  Thanks for sharing and listening to my rambling thoughts."

The child is frequently left to his own devices during the day and is homeschooled in the evenings, so he's free to roam the neighborhood.  He's been found repeatedly enticing neighborhood pets out of their yards, destroys property in people's homes and lies about it, is very rough and menacing to the other children and is a frequent bully, but is solicitous and overly well-mannered in the presence of adults.  There's tons of details to each of these behaviors that make them all the more disconcerting, but the thing that worries me most is that he was a guest in my niece's home when he noted my special needs nephew (he cannot speak, walk, multiple serious health issues) and asked, ""So you could hurt him, and he couldn't tell anyone...?"""
serialkillers,309yif,returningvideotapess,2,Sat Mar 28 01:57:19 2015 UTC,"""So you could hurt him, and he couldn't tell anyone...?""    That is utterly, utterly horrifying."

If you're offing people, it would behoove you to keep that a secret. There's no gain for him if he has to cover it up.

serialkillers,309yif,NovelistResearcher,2,Thu Mar 26 15:25:37 2015 UTC,"It was actually two of my other friends who kept wanting to include him in things toward the end of high school. For some reason, whenever we were planning to do something, they felt like we had to have four people. So he was our fourth. As senior year went on I spent less and less time with him and I gradually convinced my other two buddies that we didn't need to keep inviting him.   The final break came the summer after our freshman year of college. We were all back in our hometown and for a few weeks he kept kind of popping up when we'd be at one of the other two's house - that would be the Friend With The Awesome Basement. The Total Ass knew he could find us there. The Friend With The Awesome Basement and I had a few older friends in town, so we never wanted for beer and liquor, and my third friend was The Guy Who Knows A Billion People Who Sell Weed, so we were set for that too. On a related note, we had also set up a LAN with three permanent computers and space for a couple carry-ins. (By the standards of the day, this was pretty cool.) We had beer, pot, snacks, and Duke 3D, and Diablo. Best. Summer. Ever.   Anyway, Total Ass would show up asking if we were going to smoke or tip a few. We let him mooch for a while but after one evening of eggregious dickheadedness involving liquor he did not help pay for, we just decided he was out for good. He tended to show up early in the evening so after that we'd lie and say we didn't have any booze, couldn't buy any pot. So we'd play on the LAN a bit, and of course we'd gang up on him. Then he'd go home. I think it became apparent to him that we didn't want him around. If that bothered him he never showed it. By the end of June we'd seen the last of him."

In grade school he attacked his principle.By the time he was 15 he had been in and out of therapy and being held for examination. He is a breath away from being a tsunami of violence.His natural father has been institutionized for his own and others safety for 20 yrs. He routinely pulls a knife and threatens to kill others or himself.

I watched two people go through horrifically violent stages during their teen years (beating up parents to the point of the parents needing hospital stays to recover from their injuries, trashing their homes, beating up total strangers..) Turns out both are schizophrenic. One, after a few years of serious therapy and finding the perfect cocktail of meds is living on his own, has held a job for about 12 years and is doing well.. still a little ""off"" but doing well. The other, though he was diagnosed, didn't have the same kind of support and ended up in and out of institutions and jail.   Mental health can be a frightening thing to face."
serialkillers,309yif,ThrowAwayyyyyy4711,4,Wed Mar 25 18:23:10 2015 UTC,"There was one kid in my hiddle/high school that was severely unhinged and just a generally creepy dude. Rumors about him were flying everywhere: that he looked at gay porn in the computer labs, masturbated in class, etc.  A couple years after graduation he was arrested because he was taking hundreds of pictures of underage girls. Basically if you were female and lived in his neighborhood, he probably had pictures of you on his phone. I don't think they could get a good charge on him because the pictures were taken in public, so he's probably still around.  There was another guy at my high school that got arrested for attempted rape. He broke into a girl's house and tried to rape her but got scared off when her parents heard noises. They identified him by scratch marks her fingernails left on his neck as they struggled.   Turns out he had been breaking into other girls houses and had a collection of panties in his closet.  I'd pick those two.  Also my bullies joked about me becoming a school shooter or serial killer and trying to murder them. So me too I guess... ;_;"
serialkillers,309yif,trubleshanks,5,Thu Mar 26 05:46:01 2015 UTC,"Yup.  There's a friend of a friend that everyone gets a horrible gut feeling from. Upon meeting him for the first time, everyone that I've ever spoken to agreed that there was something seriously ""off"" about him.   He works with a friend of mine and they go on business trips together frequently. Over the years this guy started disappearing on the trips.. a few hours here and there, a day.. then he started travelling alone and meeting up with my friend. So instead of them going to Vegas together, my friend would get there and he had already been there for 2 days. The business trips were 2-3 per month, lasting 2 days to 2 weeks, mostly over Canada and the US but eventually started going all over Europe as well. Other people were on these trips as well, sometimes up to 6 others. EVERYONE was super creeped out by the guy. They would all meet up for dinner and then plan to go to a show or drinks and this guy would just disappear.. they all said he'd get a really scary look in his eyes and just.. go. Eventually (this is happening over the course of about 15 years) they start realizing that he's going to strip clubs.. ok.. no huge deal.. but then he disappears after. And then it's found that before he goes on a trip he goes to the cities craigslist and posts wanted adds for ""massages"".. then they realize that he's setting up 5, 6, 7 appointments for massages per trip. And then disappearing for days.   There were a couple incidents where my friend had to leave him, not in our home country, because there was a problem with local law enforcement.. but he (the creepy dude) was very hush-hush and wouldn't say anything about it. There are a couple cities he refuses to go to now.   I knew nothing of any of this. I knew his wife and two kids. A couple years ago my friend (the guy he travels with) introduces him to me at a party. I get the pit of your stomach-oh-my-god-don't-leave-me-alone-with-this-guy heebee jeebees. There is something super fucking scary about him.  My friend and I walk away and he says, ""So, what do you think of Mr. Blablabla?"" and I promptly tell him that if a prostitute was found in a dumpster I wouldn't think twice to point my finger at him.  Which, having just met the guy, knowing nothing about him and being Canadian was rather rude of me but as I was about to apologize he says, ""Ya. You and everyone else.""  So yes. Eventually it comes out that he has been sleeping with hundreds and hundreds of prostitutes and strippers over the years.. all the while coming home to his wife, having two kids with her but thankfully not passing anything on to her. Once she found out the marriage was over and though my friend still works with him they see very little of him (he got in serious trouble using company credit cards to pay for over $100K in ""massages"").  Rumour has it the kids are pretty fucked up. Like.. the kind of kid that plays ""doctor"" a little too much.. my friends won't let their kids be alone with them.  So does a sexual addiction = a serial killer? No. But it's the creep factor. The idea that everyone he comes in contact with gets an immediate fight or flight reaction to just being near him... <shudder>.. I don't know.. I won't be surprised if he's ever found out.."
serialkillers,309yif,RedEyeView,4,Wed Mar 25 22:36:21 2015 UTC,"The most important thing is the feeling he gives you(and everyone else.) I met a guy like that one night at an outdoor musical festival...the friend I was with had dated him a few years back and she still had a HUGE raised scar on her arm where he had attacked her with a box cutter when they broke up.  So, I thought it was kinda odd that she seemed to have no fear of him when we happened to run into him and two other guys he was with at the festival. He and his 2 friends just attached themselves to my friend and I and we became a larger group- nothing that strange so far aside from knowing he was the guy who had slashed my friend's arm open.  But within the third or fourth sentence out of his mouth I just KNEW something was very wrong and that we were ALL in danger from him(even his two friends). It was dusk outside and we had stopped and all sat down in a pretty secluded area. one of his guy friends sat beside me and the other was kinda getting up, back and forth between standing and going to talk to Box Cutter Slasher guy about random stuff.   Box Cutter Slasher's voice was so...hollow but engaged, NOT detached like in a trance...just empty. His eyes had a coldness to them and his body movements just struck me as off...though I couldn't pinpoint why.  I felt like if I said anything or tried to get my friend and I to leave he would murder us all. So I said nothing but when I looked over to his friend that had been sitting beside me his friend had clearly noticed whatever it was I had noticed and I could see in HIS eyes he was just as scared as I was...the only thing his friend said to me the whole night was a whisper: ""If he asks to see your purse don't let him, he's looking for something sharp."" I nodded and sure enough a few minutes later Box Cutter Slasher says to me ""That sure is a big purse, I bet you have all kinds of shit in there. Do you have some scissors?"" I laughed nervously and said I didn't carry scissors around, sorry. and then Box Cutter Slasher went on a weird tangent about how he bets he could kill everyone here using only the contents of my purse.   We all laughed it off and I don't know how but my friend and I were able to find some valid excuse to leave. I was so relieved to be away from that guy but my friend-who had suffered extreme violence from him and still carried the huge scar on her arm-hadn't seemed the least bit phased by him at all and seemed to be enjoying his company! Anyway, about a month and a half later he was in the local newspaper for murdering a man.  I wasn't surprised at all."
serialkillers,309yif,PapaDave130,2,Thu Mar 26 05:32:29 2015 UTC,"I actually may have had 'contact' with someone that if they were not already, could have become a killer.  My husband runs a voluntary scheme to raise money for disadvantaged people, and he recruits workers to volunteer their time. There is a running joke with this kind of work that no 'normal' person gives their time for free, and I am genuinely starting to believe that.   Anyway, he had this homeless guy apply to work, and despite living in and out of hostels, the guy had some great experience and seemed keen to work and passed all the fit to work tests including being allowed around children and having no criminal charges, though he always across a little 'off' but a lot of people did. My husband gives nearly everyone a first chance and this guy was very religious which appeared to be a good thing. So hubby had him raising money from the premises every Sunday along with another guy that would always bring friends to keep him company as he didn't like to be alone and was quite shy.  At first, all was well. Then my husband started to notice little things like coffee and milk and toilet paper going missing, every Monday with only two workers on a Sunday, it wasn't hard to deduce who may have been stealing. He thought 'well this man is homeless' and turned a blind eye to it, the man was a good worker and was giving up his free time after all. One day a photo frame went missing, then an ornament the next- all cheap, rubbishy items so it made no sense to sacrifice a valuable worker.   After a few months, My husband began to doubt both of the Sunday workers. The one with all the friends didn't really like to give up his free time and could never be relied on. The homeless guy seemed to hate contact and would try to avoid being in my husbands presence as much as he could. My husband thanked them both for their hard work and contributions then told them he wont require their services any more on Sundays and though they were free to work in the week, they both refused.   Two months later I was browsing a local news sight and I read an article about a man that had just been put away for life. Holding prisoner and violently raping several women (not all at once) and raping children AND performing violent sexual acts on dogs. It didn't sink in at first until I literally told my husband to 'get a load of this creep!'. He read the name, saw the face and it all clicked. It's unlikely he was a serial killer as he was pretty nomadic in the area and there were no regular murders in the area that could be attributed to the same killer. There were fears that there could have been a lot more rape victims that were not linked to him or hadn't come forward though.  I realise I am being sketchy with some details here, to preserve anonymity and all that!"

Some of their histories contained indicators of severe personjality disturbances from adolescence. Others were just average kids from average families until one event (in this case a brain injury) led to a whole personality overhaul and loss of empathy.   The signs of sociopathy are visible from a young age, but it does not always indicate that they will become serial killers. Many disturbed kids get treatment and become capable adults. Others go into business and make their killings on the stock exchange without ever harming (or desiring to harm) another human being (See Wolf of Wallstreet).   Assuming anyone without training and qualifications in psychology can faultlessly diagnose a would-be serial killer based on a few childhood events is reserved for the writers of crime dramas etc."

He asked me to pet-sit his cat several times when he went out of town, which I happily did as a teen. His house was super creepy, every mirror had writing all over it. I think they were pieces of scripture or something, but every mirror (including a floor length one in the living room and the bathroom mirror) was so covered in writing that you couldn't really see yourself in them.   He also had a string of roommates who would live there a month or two, then we would never see them again. Maybe bad luck, but the creepy part was that they all looked the same. Small set brunette guys with curly hair. The first couple I don't know that I even realized they were different guys, but then one that had a dog moved in and I realized he was obviously new. After that I saw a series of like 6-7 different guys over the course of a few years.

I was half-arsedly trying to investigate what safety advice police release to the public when different crimes are happening. Not sure if you are in Australia, but here there is an ongoing controversy about police giving sexist warnings, when a woman is killed then police tell other women to not go into dark places alone, not be out at night alone etc. The complaint is that men do not get the same safety warnings. I figured the Milat murders would demonstrate whether this was true: Both males and females were in danger so it would have been interesting to see whether the warning were gendered, or if there were warnings given at all.

I still get chills whenever someone mentions him. I think part of it was because his crimes involved children, but I also think it was because of how nonchalant he was about it. It was like the most normal thing in the world for him to tell authorities if he was released, he would go right back out and kill more children."

Had he not been caught when he was, his killings and fetishes would only have gotten more evil and twisted. He had many plans of torturing children in some evil ways. Also if I'm not mistaken he would almost kill his victims, the revive them and tell them they where going to live, then start killing them again just so he could fill his sick needs over and over.

She even harasses the Columbine victims families.   She told Daniel Mausers (sp?) Dad that his son was a fat loser who deserved to die. She has posters of Eric on her bedroom wall, she had a pillowcase made with his face on it, she wears a necklace with his picture on it. She trolls YouTube and makes the same comment on all the Columbine videos. Her comment is "" Eric Harris <3<3<3""  If you get a chance you should check out her facebook page. Google ""Lynn Ann Columbine"" and it will show you all of her accounts. She even made an Eric Harris fan page on fb.

With a serial killer it's not just a crime of passion or fit of rage(the killings CAN be) but it's not a one time thing.    They plan, they stalk, they hone their skills. All the while putting up a facade to the people in their lives that they are normal. It's just interesting to see how these people lived."

He seemed just like a really disturbed alcoholic with a zombie fetish that got way out of hand. It seemed like he sincerely regretted who he had become. I don't know, though. You can never tell with serial killers - they're all pretty adept at making themselves seem more human than they really are."
serialkillers,2zumxj,DoctorDanDrangus,29,Sun Mar 22 00:58:52 2015 UTC,"I'm going to play devil's advocate and totally disagree with you here (and self-plagiarize from my comment on the weekly thread about Dahmer). I don't understand this sub's weird love for Dahmer. Every time Dahmer's brought up, people rush to be like ""I feel sorry for him more than anything"", and I get that impulse –– for an analogue, I've felt that a few times while reading Dennis Nillson's writing, though it's quite obvious with him and with Dahmer that, ultimately, it's simultaneous self-loathing/self-aggrandizing manipulation. I feel like a lot of people romanticize themselves into his position — ""I've always wanted to be loved too; there but for the grace if God go I"" blah blah blah, ignoring the real specifics of Dahmer's endgame.  I was looking at something Bob Keppel wrote about Dahmer recently (he calls him the ""black hole at the end of the continuum"" of serial killer behavior, take that as you will), and I do agree that there's something deeply insidious and frightening about Dahmer's compulsive need to possess his victims in every way possible. Did he enjoy the killing part? Maybe not –– but he pressed on because what he wanted was to completely and totally own another person. Not for companionship — for ownership, domination of the individual that goes beyond their deaths. Not only to have mastery over their deaths, but to possess them completely, body and soul, which he believed he could. Other killers like Bundy, Ridgway, etc. hid their dump sites in order to feel ownership over their kills, and Zodiac/BTK paid lip service to the idea of ""collecting slaves for the afterlife"", but Dahmer took this ""trophy mentality"" absolutely seriously(/spiritually) and let his behavior take it to the nth degree. Especially if he actually had BPD instead of psychopathy (which I don't really buy, although I think his psychology was complicated), that makes this pathology even more chilling because he would have to push through a moral sense achieve his goal.  My vote for least evil? Probably someone like Herbert Mullin (who killed because he believed it would stop God from destroying California with earthquakes) — folks who were very clearly at the mercy of a devastating illness. Mullin would have failed the policemen-at-the-elbow test in a moment. In contrast, Dahmer had that actually happen when the 14-year-old boy he was raping and mutilating escaped from his apartment. Dahmer deftly lied to the cops, dragged the child back upstairs, and then drilled further into his head and injected him with more acid, killing him, then sexually assaulted the corpse, dismembered it, and added his head to his trophy collection."

I think Edwards was both manipulator and mastermind. The fact that his daughter turned him in, her story for why she suspected him, and the timeline provided to Cameron for where they travelled and when makes a pretty good argument I think. But you'd have to read the book to agree or disagree.  The story of Edwards confessing in order to have the death penalty should tell you exactly what kind of creature you are encountering.   Cameron's initial letter to Edwards is pretty funny. He just calls him out and says how about we clear this cold case up finally. And that's the beginning of the rabbit hole.  Also watch the interviews with Edwards on YouTube about how he plans his adopted son's death. He starts planning it the moment he meets him. It's chilling how he delivers it like it isn't about the planned cold blooded murder of someone for money (or sport?)."

I mean, maybe it's just wishful thinking"
serialkillers,2zlwoc,Plush_Pineapple,4,Thu Mar 19 22:45:25 2015 UTC,"To me, it seems like it could possibly be just a clickbait article to pick up on the current heightened interest in the LISK cases. They're very careful to make enough connections between the cases/victims to build a bit of intrigue but actually, none of these connections are really tangible or even vaguely out of the ordinary once you look at them closely. Furthermore, the article is pretty terribly written and they mentioned a reading from a psychic in a serious news article. Doesn't exactly make them seem credible!  Realistically the only thing that made me go 'huh' was the use of burlap to wrap the bodies in both the LISK victims and the Atlantic City victims, as that seems like a fairly unusual choice. However, I don't know that the police not saying anything one way or another is really as poignant as the article suggests. Whilst police stations are often keen to keep quiet any connections between cases to avoid panic/encouraging killers, they're also just as keen to keep quiet about connections in case they're proved wrong, and also to avoid tainting potential jury members and therefore running the risk of not getting a conviction if/when they do find their man.  One thing I did think is that the article doesn't mention if the AC victims found their clients in the same way as the LISK victims. I'd be interested to know if they all used Craigs List because from my point of view, there's a big difference in victimisation between someone who targets street sex workers and someone who targets sex workers through an escort company/Craigs List. If there was some overlap there, it might add more credibility to the theory that they're connected.   Unfortunately it's not uncommon for serial killers to target sex workers and I definitely wouldn't be surprised to hear of multiple serial killers targeting victims from a similar background at roughly the same time. Sex workers are such a vulnerable group and it's not like the police put in much effort to protect them or bring their attackers to justice - if you're a serial killer, you're probably acutely aware of that."
serialkillers,2zlwoc,SuffragettePizza,2,Thu Mar 19 23:10:43 2015 UTC,"Oh, the article itself is absolutely terrible –– it's a shame, because the only LISK-related articles to come out in the past few years have been pretty poorly done clickbait.  What interested me, though, were the connections between the murdered women in mentioned in the article and two of the four Gilgo Beach victims, Melissa Barthelemy and Amber Lynn Costello. The number of sex workers in the NJ-NYC-LI corridor is gargantuan and stratified, and especially as Costello, iirc, had spelt little time in NYC relative to the other girls and did not associate widely, it's a fairly odd coincidence.   Not that I really think these cases are connected, but there were a couple of things that reminded me of the Green River investigation –– Ridgway, as part of his strategy, would frequent prostitutes without killing them, specifically to gain the trust of the community –– he would namedrop some of the girls to others so that he appeared to be trusted and conversant in their world (I believe Shawcross also did this), and in Lost Girls, it was suggested that LISK would have done the same. Also, the bodies left in clusters of four is interesting, as it's indicative, often, of a killer who revisits his kills. Somewhere Ridgway talks about how he would keep them in clusters of 3-5 (I think); any more than that and he feared they would attract police. I think Bundy did something similar when he killed in Washington State."

I think there are a lot more victims than they know about. Gore's letters were the only ones in the book that came off as truthful. His modus operandi with his cousin was perfect for the 80's with the lack of cell phones and surveillance.  He described driving a couple hours from home and cruising every exit. They'd get off at an exit then immediately go back up the on ramp because that's where it's most likely you'll encounter a hitchhiker trying to get on a highway.  Gore's brutality and utter lack of remorse was a hard read sometimes.   I hadn't heard of Gore until I saw a show called Twisted on ID last week. That's how I came across the book.

Florida in general seems like a pretty big magnet for serial killers...I wonder if that's because there's a lot of tourists and transient people down there.  As for this case, I found it pretty fascinating because EVERYTHING had to line up to save Lynn Elliot's friend- Lynn being brave enough to make a run for it because she knew that she wasn't getting out alive if she stayed there, the kid who just randomly stopped by the house which was semi-secluded, and the police being able to get there in time. If Lynn hadn't made a run for it at the same exactly time a kid had just happened by the house, Lynn's friend would be dead as well, and lots of other women."

And a small piece I found on a ""worst killers of South Africa"" page somewhere:  Cedric Maake (Wemmer Pan Killer) Murdered 27 victims  Cedric Maake was unique in that he had no victim or weapon preference. As long as he could mutilate, rape and kill, any person of any race, sex and age would do. Maake is known as the “Wemmer Pan Killer” because it was in this area of Johannesburg that he targeted most of his victims. At first favoring shop owners and taxi drivers – Maake would rob them and beat them to death. He progressed to couples and women, killing the men while the women watched and raping and killing the women afterwards. Police at first thought they were looking for two separate killers. It was only when the investigations started overlapping that they realized it was one single killer. During his trial, Maake pleaded not guilty. Ghastly details emerged in court. Surviving female victims testified against him, looking back on how he would kick and scream vulgarities at them while they were lying crushed on the ground. Experts offered graphic accounts of how Maake used huge rocks to crush the skulls of some of the male victims. Maake’s conduct in court was equally horrific, emphasized by his screaming, crying and head-banging fits. He even threatened to rape and murder the female state prosecutor just as he did his female victims. On September 6, 2000, he was convicted of 27 murders, 26 attempted murders, 14 rapes, 41 aggravated robberies and other less serious offenses. He was found guilty of 114 of 134 charges and sentenced to 27 life sentences (one life sentence for each murder) plus 1159 years and 3 months imprisonment. In total, his sentence amounted to 1,340 years in prison."

serialkillers,2zd2st,BrianW1999,5,Tue Mar 17 20:26:06 2015 UTC,"He claimed to have abducted and tortured 40 women. No bodies have been found and he died in prison. The FBI did release photos of evidence obtained from the crime scene which is personal items of people - possible victims - that haven't been identified. These appear to be trinkets or souvenirs from his victims. Most of the items aren't things someone would normally give someone like name badges, medical bracelet, underwear, etc. and none of the items were reported missing or stolen either.   He was also accused by his girlfriend(s?) whom participated that he killed several people and based on evidence the police believe there may be up to 60 people he murdered. ""Serial Killer"" is mostly the psychological aspect of the killings (the satisfaction of some mental need) and of course ""more than two victims"" at different times.   He also had a diary documenting his victims which revealed a lot - except for location. And seeing this evidence I linked above, the medical bracelet is for epilepsy - I can't imagine that person could endure electrocutions and torture as long, if at all, as a healthy person would.   His prerecorded instructions to his victims made it clear he felt they were disposable. And being a local park ranger, he knew the desert very well making disposal ""easy"".  TLDR: Together with the evidence that makes it clear there is way more than just one random victim and his prolonged perverted psychological motives, it all makes for the perfect portrait of a serial killer."

Empty the chest cavity, fill it with rocks, sew it back up.  Sink them in Elephant Butte Lake, and the lake's aggressive fish species would leave absolutely nothing remaining before long.  That's why they have searched his marked spots on the lake, and found nothing.  He claimed to have killed at least one person a year since 1957, to one of his accomplices.  He told another accomplice of hundreds of killings, not sure how exaggerated that might be but I would believe it based solely on the timeframe in which he was active (42 years)."

Denke was born in Münsterberg, Silesia in the Kingdom of Prussia (now Ziębice in Poland).  At the age of 12 he ran away from home; little else is known about his early life. However, in adulthood he worked as an organ player at the local church and was well-liked in his community. Denke quit church membership in 1906.  On December 20, 1924, Denke was arrested after attacking a man at his house with an axe. Police searched Denke's home and found human flesh in huge jars of curing salts. A ledger contained the details of at least 42 people whom Denke had murdered and cannibalized between 1914 and 1918.   It is thought he even sold the flesh of his victims at the Breslau (today's Wrocław) market as pork.

It all points to extreme curiosity. It's obviously still wrong but his motives seem opposite to the 'traditional serial killer'.  Maybe he was doing whatever it took to build his 'sex zombie'.

serialkillers,2yvatg,aggitator2007,1 point,Sun Mar 15 00:36:08 2015 UTC,"I know what you mean, it's hard to feel sorry for any of these people but there is something about Dahmer that makes me feel bad for him. I think it's the fact that he seemed so disgusted, ashamed and resentful of himself and he showed a great deal of remorse for his crimes. I don't think I've seen another serial killer who shows so much emotion, self loathing, confusion and regret as Dahmer and it's part of what makes his case so fascinating."
serialkillers,2yvatg,Anhydrol,5,Fri Mar 13 23:09:22 2015 UTC,"I absolutely agree. I do not understand why some people hold this almost-admiration for Dahmer above anyone else in discussions on this sub. While I do not feel sorry for serial killers, I do feel that there is something inherently wrong with them which disables them from resisting their impulses. I do not feel any further sympathy for Dahmer though just because he drugged his victims first and, sort of, like, did not want to do it."
serialkillers,2yvatg,Dickbutt_Jr,1 point,Sat Mar 14 14:00:21 2015 UTC,"I don't mean to make Dahmer sound like an innocent, good person who made a mistake, not at all. I understand he was a very disturbed, bad person who did unbelievably terrible things to other people and I don't take his words at face value and blindly believe everything he says. I just think from what I've seen and heard of him that he had some kind of genuine remorse and he knew he had to be locked up otherwise it would continue to happen. I'm no expert in Psychopathy but I do not believe he was a Psychopath, he doesn't share very many traits and was actually diagnosed as having BPD which I believe warrants a very different personality."
serialkillers,2yvatg,BadGuy75,0,Thu Mar 19 15:44:56 2015 UTC,"Are you saying you think dahmer was a psychopath rather than having BPD, which according to other verified psychologists and psychiatrists on this site cannot coexist unless one was a mis diagnosis? I find this very interesting as I had a length conversation about that stance but was co tinually shot doen for even considering it to be true. Please, could you clarify for me your exact opinion on the matter?"
serialkillers,2yvatg,Throwaway43416,1 point,Sat Mar 14 17:11:05 2015 UTC,"I guess the reason I haven't seen Dahmer as being a psychopath is down to the way I've perceived him as being depressed, lonely, nervous, shy...things that aren't normally linked to psychopaths. But of course, psychopathy isn't a one size fits all issue so it's perfectly reasonable to think he was one. I'm so used to seeing a Ted Bundy or an Ed Kemper as textbook psychopaths that I never thought of him that way, it's interesting that you bring these things up though and it's given me something to think about."

serialkillers,2yvatg,aggitator2007,4,Fri Mar 13 15:46:22 2015 UTC,"Apparently Scarver said the attacks were unplanned but I don't buy for one second that he picked Dahmer, one of the most notorious serial killers in history, at random. I definitely think the race factor played a part in that."

serialkillers,2yvatg,askryan,4,Fri Mar 13 22:21:50 2015 UTC,"Well, there's some speculation that the prison guards knew what they were doing when they put the three of them on the same work detail and then left them alone."

serialkillers,2yvatg,samanthahazard,3,Sat Mar 14 14:05:39 2015 UTC,"His death is particularly interesting to me, murdered similarly to his victims.

serialkillers,2yvatg,aggitator2007,1 point,Tue Mar 17 21:40:56 2015 UTC,"Did they have a choice in company though?  edit I would have thought the company you keep would usually depend on who you would chose to maintain as company.

serialkillers,2yvatg,aggitator2007,1 point,Fri Mar 13 23:18:12 2015 UTC,The company you keep extends to who you are able to maintain as company. Becoming imprisoned for serial murder is an extreme case of those options being limited due to your actions.
serialkillers,2yvatg,Psychopath-,5,Tue Mar 17 21:39:48 2015 UTC,"I'm going to play devil's advocate (at least for this sub) –– I do not understand, at all, the sympathy people have toward Dahmer here. Every time Dahmer's brought up, people rush to be like ""I feel sorry for him more than anything"", and I get that impulse –– for an analogue, I've felt that a few times while reading Dennis Nillson's writing, though it's quite obvious with him and with Dahmer that, ultimately, it's ultimately simultaneous self-loathing/self-aggrandizing manipulation.  But I was looking at something Bob Keppel wrote about Dahmer recently (he calls him the ""black hole at the end of the continuum"" of serial killer behavior, take that as you will), and I do agree that there's something deeply insidious and frightening about Dahmer's compulsive need to possess his victims in every way possible. Did he enjoy the killing part? Maybe not –– but he pressed on because what he wanted was to completely and totally own another person. Not only to have mastery over their deaths, but to possess them completely, body and soul. Other killers like Bundy, Ridgway, etc. hid their dump sites in order to feel ownership over their kills, and Zodiac/BTK paid lip service to the idea of ""collecting slaves for the afterlife"", but Dahmer took this tendency to the nth degree. Especially if he actually had BPD instead of psychopathy (which I don't really buy, although I think his psychology was complicated), that makes this pathology even more chilling."

From August 1991 to January 1992 he shot eleven people in the Stockholm and Uppsala area, most of whom were immigrants, killing one and seriously injuring the others.

Poking around, I did find this interview with one of his victims. I'm not usually a huge fan of vice, but it seems a pretty even-handed interview.   This article details his most recent refusal of clemency, as well as giving some additional background.  Wish I could find a doc."
serialkillers,2ytpdl,tmc_throwaway,3,Fri Mar 13 03:37:01 2015 UTC,Any idea why he was initially a suspect in the Olof Palme assassination?
serialkillers,2ytpdl,dinkblagger,2,Fri Mar 13 05:25:44 2015 UTC,"Not really, although I've only heard it said that he was actually named by police on John's wiki. What I've usually heard elsewhere is more along what is stated in the Olof Palme wiki page--where he is listed after a laundry list of other much stronger suspects in the ""other theories"" heading. Here's the entirety of what it says there:   John Ausonius, ""the Laser Man"", also known as John Stannerman, was initially one of the suspects but it turned out that Ausonius had a solid alibi, as he was imprisoned on the night Palme was shot.  So, I think it was more of a ""no stone unturned"" kinda thing than any real suspicion. He was a known extremist and the hunt for Olof's killer was (I believe) the largest to that date in Swedish history, only to be exceeded in the hunt for Ausonius later. But all of that is speculation & I don't have time to try to source anything tonight. My feeling is that John's wiki is overstating it a touch."

Extremely intelligent and self-analytical serial killer who calmly explains why he butchered numerous co-eds and eventually murdered his mom and had sex with her corpse.  It's chilling because he's so calm and rational about the insane things that he did.  His matter-of-fact anecdotes about his kills offer a rare insight into the mind of a killer.  Even killers who decide to ""own"" their kills in interviews don't come close to Kemper.  Kemper talks about everything; how he tricked his victims into believing he was harmless, how he killed them, how he played with their corpses, and how he disposed of them.  He talks about mistakes he made like (temporarily) locking himself out of his car with a victim inside.  It's worth a watch."

serialkillers,2ymcvm,The_Lady_In_Pink,11,Wed Mar 11 00:01:11 2015 UTC,"Well, when serial murder was first being designated as a specific type of crime, as opposed to the previous catchall of mass murder where it was previously thought to fall, one of the defining factors was generally the fact that, unlike most other multiple murderers, they almost always targeted strangers or people with whom they only had the most vague passing acquaintance. Most male killers still adhere to this criteria, so when people refer to Wuornos as the first serial killer it's usually meant as the first ""true"" serial killer- as in, the first whose motives and MO were almost indistinguishable from her male counterparts, as opposed to the more common profile of female serial killers as comfort killers targeting family, children, or the elderly.

The murder of Mark Hall is the worst thing I've ever read:    In this murder, later described by prosecutors as ""the worst"" of all of the known murders committed by Kraft,[31] the man was driven to a remote canyon, where he was bound to a tree. The autopsy report listed the cause of death as being asphyxiation caused by leaves and earth found lodged deep into the youth's trachea. The autopsy also revealed Hall had been sodomized and emasculated, with his severed genitals then inserted into his rectum. The youth's chest, scrotum, nose and cheeks had been burned with an automobile cigarette lighter, with his eyes being destroyed by the same object. In addition, Hall's legs bore numerous incisions which had been inflicted with a broken bottle. Forensic experts were able to deduce that Hall had been alive throughout much of the ordeal.[55]"

And also agree that while serial killers have a preferred victim type, this does not mean that they will hesitate to kill those that don't meet their type (e.g., victims of opportunity when disorganized, killing a person that gets in their way). The theory on Ted Bundy's victims is that they looked like Stephanie Brooks (pseudonym), Bundy's girlfriend in college who dumped him. Stephanie had long dark hair parted in the middle. Yes, a lot of girls wore their hair that way back then, but I still think he had a preferred type.

That is, Bundy was an organized serial killer who acted in a disorganized manner at the end, but he was still an organized serial killer. And yes, organized serial killers choose victims of opportunity when the impulse can not be controlled (e.g., BTK deciding to kill Shirley Vian after the woman he had been intending to kill was not home). But BTK was still an organized serial killer. Re: MO, BTK deviated from his MO with another victim, but this was because he did not have the time to strangle her and stabbed her instead (and he had shot her brother, whose presence he did not anticipate). But he was still organized. Just like you said, it gets blurry.  I agree re: Bundy, I'm not 100% convinced he was choosing victims that resembled Stephanie. A former professor of mine knew Bundy (Bundy was his T.A. at University of Washington) and he said that he didn't believe Bundy chose girls that looked like Stephanie. But I'm just not sure. Yes, the one thing that is concrete about Bundy's signature type is that they were females. For the most part, they were attractive and college age.

""GeGeGe no Kitarō"". Is a manga about Japanese ghost and fairy and demons etc. all done in a fairy tale manner - not scary. It is about group of demon/fairy fighting to keep the world in order from the evil trouble causing demons. One of the most renowned and cherished old style manga in japan. It had been in circulation since 1960.  ""ねずみ男"" literately translate into rat man.  The rat man character in the manga was like a mischief conspiring money driven fairy/demon. He represent not good or evil. A selfish but sometime still have conscious person.  He is also interested in the occult and sometimes got himself into trouble over the matter.  He usually appear as a consultant advising human who were naive or greedy. And then things got out of hand  (bigger evil demon appear and proceed to threaten rat man and causing trouble to the human world) he run away to ask the main character for help.

I mean, he was pretty upfront about everything he did with investigators.  That being said, I don't believe Otis Toole killed Walsh either. I think investigators in Florida realized how much they royally fucked over this case, and considering how few suspects they already has, they decided to go with the one most generally accepted by the public. I seriously don't understand how they lost so much evidence in that case, really unprofessional."

If Dahmer admitted to the high profile murder of a child in Florida, there was a good chance he'd be executed for it. The other crimes he admitted to, on the other hand, only got him prison time, something he already had.  I'm not sure I believe it, but it is a possibility."

serialkillers,2xtgpq,thatonechick33,6,Wed Mar 4 04:00:11 2015 UTC,"I started reading this book last night. I am kind of torn on this issue. Yes, Dahmer admitted to being in Miami at the time Adam Walsh disappeared, but he swore he did not kill him. None of Jeffrey's other victims were that young. We know that age doesn't always mean anything. Ted Bundy and Richard Ramirez mostly killed adults, but both of them were proven to have killed at least one child. Miami police seem to have left out a lot of information in the Adam Walsh case. John Walsh, himself, went back and forth on whether Otis O'Toole really killed his son. The book is fascinating. I highly recommend it."
serialkillers,2xtgpq,BeachGlassBlazer,10,Tue Mar 3 19:24:19 2015 UTC,"What's the motive? He's too young compared to the other victims. And Dahmer presented as a lonely gay man, only wanting company. Albeit that company was him trying to make sex zombies, but still. No motive for him to kill Adam Walsh. It's just so out of place.  Edit: As for the other notorious killers admitting to killing children, a lot of them kill them on accident. Either its one of their first victims and they don't know how fragile the child is, or they are used to killing adults and they don't know how fragile the child is. In Adam's case, it seems like someone deliberately took him. I don't think Dahmer would lie in wait and I dont think he would just take the opportunity to abduct the child if it presented."
serialkillers,2xtgpq,KANNABULL,3,Tue Mar 3 19:28:23 2015 UTC,"Apparently, the author thinks the motive was the same. It was sexual. I agree with you about it being outside of his usual M.O but it is possible. Ramirez's DNA was linked to the 9 year old girl he killed. That is thought to be his first kill. Bundy was said to have killed Kimberly Leach, a 12 year old while he was absconded from custody. He was already a well established killer and the child did not fit his usual M.O.   According to this book, Dahmer lived less than 20 miles from the mall where Adam was abducted. He had access to a blue van that 3  witnesses said they saw a man put Adam into. Adam was decapitated, which Dahmer did with all of his victims. The heads were Dahmer's trophy of choice. I don't think Dahmer would have just tossed the head away to be found though. He usually removed all tissue, and painted or bleached the skulls.   Dahmer was questioned about the Adam Walsh case, at the request of John Walsh. Dahmer claims to know nothing about the little boy or his abduction and murder. Dahmer never denied anything else he had done. The only thing I can think of that would give him reason to lie would be that Florida had the death penalty and the other states he killed in, did not at that time."
serialkillers,2xtgpq,BeachGlassBlazer,3,Tue Mar 3 20:00:44 2015 UTC,"Like you said, yes, Dahmer's trophy's but he kept them - wouldnt toss any. However I dont recall Toole decapitating anyone. I do think given Adam's age and structure, a grown man in rage could probably easily, if not accidently, decapitate him. Did they release the autopsy report on the head? I never heard about it...  Dahmer also admitted to all of his slayings - no reason for him to hold back - he even discussed everything openly with his parents.   Toole admitted and recantted several murders. He had a ""death bed"" confession about Adam. He had no one claim his body and was buried at the prison. He had nothing to live for and really no reason to lie.   There may be yet another murderer..."
serialkillers,2xtgpq,Alpha-Pig,0,Tue Mar 3 21:24:22 2015 UTC,"I am thinking it was someone totally different as well. Toole was talked to extensively about the Adam Walsh case and he claimed to have killed him, but when he was asked specific questions about the crime, he answered them all wrong. I think it was mentioned that he was mentally challenged as well.   John Walsh went back and forth between Dahmer and Toole, but then miraculously decided that he trusted the police department and he fully believed that Toole did it. I think Walsh cared more about the budding fame and opportunity for money then he did finding the murderer. Books, Talk Shows, AMW.....His murdered child became his bread and butter. He makes me sick.  Sorry for the Walsh rant, I just cannot stand him."

Anything that simulates or allows the vicarious experience of violence might lessen the pressure that builds up that makes him feel like going from thinking to acting. Even something like hunting, if that's something he'd have access to doing. It's not the same, but it's something, and it won't risk jail.

Some looser interpretations of serial murder include any killers who commit two or more separate homicides with a cooling-off period in between.  I'm not saying I agree. I don't find Manson or his lackeys particularly intriguing. I'm just saying an argument could be made for his inclusion. But mostly he's allowed here because /u/liberto asked for feedback on the subject and the majority of responses and votes were in favor of continuing to let it go.  Edit: Clarity.

Singer created a report on her theories of brainwashing, but it was rejected by the American Psychological Association - some described the report as ""so flawed that it was almost ridiculous"".

If it takes an extra sentence to clarify that we're talking about realistic brainwashing instead of movie hypnotist mind control, that's fine.

As far as that goes, Arthur Leigh Allen wasn't really ""cleared"" — he was excluded as the donor of the DNA on the back of a stamp from one of the late letters — so all we can really prove is that he didn't lick that stamp. It's worth noting too that the letter in question is one of the disputed ones, and unusual in that one of the characteristics SFPD looked for in distinguishing a true Zodiac was the lack of saliva on a letter. Allen also is recorded as stating to friends that he gagged at the taste of stamp glue and wouldn't lick stamps or envelopes.  Not to say Allen was the Zodiac, but he's leagues ahead as the best suspect, and it's worth reading about him if you're interested in the case. Even if he wasn't the Zodiac, he was a truly bizarre character."

serialkillers,2xaluq,Jfreid05,1 point,Fri Feb 27 20:05:02 2015 UTC,"Steve hodel used his position on the local police force to influence investigations into the murders of the zodiac. He later used his reputation as a high ranking detective to write a book and draw attention to himself and the murders, while framing his father for the murders. His father was indeed the black dahlia killer and the lipstick killer which he did no time for due to the police forcing a confession out of heirens.(typical of psychopathic police chasing promotions or of their minions trying to close a case) However G Hodel soon became too old to continue the murders at which point Steve used his position on the police force to continue the murders and influence the investigations enough to keep himself from being caught and to influence drawingsnof the witnesses description of the (supposed) killers. There may have been an overlap period when both individuals were commiting murders, with Steve supposedly copying his father using his personal experience with him and inside inside information of the killings.  The actions G Hodel were the actions of a bored psychopath. Psychopathy breeds psychopathy. Steve was simply following in his fathers footsteps, unable to handle the lack of attention he was getting from his meagre profession, when compared to his father being a physician, and as such ended up writing a book framing his father for his work, thus attracting more attention to himself ajd the case. Also, Steve became more manipulative and was able to unfluence people around him due to his above average intelligence in a field where the average iq is expected to be quite low. Why would the son of a phsycian become a police officer despite the probably of being of high iq like most phsycians and their children? A lack of parental care, typical of psychopaths  If you truly want to read a book about the Zodiac killer, not necessarily the details of the killing but about the mind if the killer, read a book written by Steve Hodel."

serialkillers,2xaluq,bum10001,1 point,Mon Mar 2 15:00:25 2015 UTC,"Lol, yes, that post was written by stretch armstrong. But now that I've written it, I do wonder about the possible credability of it as the psychological profiles fit the story quite well. Steve does say that he suspected his father of being the zodiac killer, but only after he died. For Steve to suspect his father of being capable of such things, he must at least have grim thoughts of him for a reason, and psychopathy is thought to be genetical and environmental. Also, Steve's father is a dead ringer for an eye witness picture of the zodiac killer. Also, the convicted lipstick killer reports to have his confession 'beaten' and tortued outbof him, so it is open to speculation. If you have an inteest in the zodiac case, that is an avenue to look into."

She tells everyone what she's going to do, she kills someone who can be easily traced back to her - she was too impulsive and would never have gotten it together to have covered her tracks to kill over and over without getting caught.  Successful serial killers draw a lot less attention to themselves, they can plan enough to kill without being spotted, hide a body, construct an alibi if necessary and hide any forensic evidence.   Really the take-away from this should be that people need to step in to stop child abuse - HOW no one was rescuing her children is beyond me. Grown adults watched her abuse her child and did nothing. Makes me wonder if some of the stories about her prior to the murder might be exaggerated by locals who don't want anyone questioning why they didn't care when they knew children were being abused."

He gave a lecture to my class (a forensic psychology class) back in 2007. When he went into all of the details of the case, how much effort the FBI had put into catching this guy, and how frustrating it was, and how they finally had a chance to match his DNA via the PAP smear...them doing this made perfect sense to me, how often the greater good (catching BTK) outweighs what is considered a possible violation of rights. It wasn't something that was taken lightly, them obtaining the DNA that way, they were out of options at the time."

I'm sure his a philosophical conversation that would end with us agreeing to disagree.  So I'll skip ahead.  How is it possible they were unable to indirectly obtain his own DNA or get a court order to compel a sample?  They had a trove of evidence.  Share the lecture insights on that if you can.  I'd be very interested!"
serialkillers,2wxk3w,siamesekitten,2,Wed Feb 25 02:56:48 2015 UTC,"I agree regarding where do you draw the line? It's tough.  During the lecture, the FBI profiler talked mostly about BTK's crimes – his victims, his MO, timeline, etc. When he talked about the arrest, he said that a computer disc is what led them to BTK. BTK dropped off a computer disk in one of his packages to the media, and the disk was analyzed by a computer specialist in the FBI. They were able to determine where it was used (Rader's church and somewhere else I think), and that a file on the disk was created by a ""Dennis."" They took this information, did a search, and found out that a guy named Dennis Rader was listed the president of this church. At this point, they were almost positive that Rader was their guy, but they did not have enough evidence to arrest him. The way this FBI profiler explained it, they felt stuck, and were afraid that they would alert Rader if they tried to collect further evidence. They were concerned he would destroy evidence, kill more people, and/or flee. They were very careful, and only a few people in the FBI knew that Dennis Rader was considered the primary suspect at this time. They ran a background check on him, determined who his family members were, and then subpoenaed his daughter's medical records. They ran the DNA (semen from an old crime scene) against his daughter's from her PAP smear, and got a match. They arrested Rader RIGHT after that.   One of the coolest things about this lecture was that he showed us pictures from some of BTK's crime scenes that have never been released to the public. BTK is one sick dude.   I'm not sure if you are familiar with the Psychopathy Checklist–Revised (PCL–R)? 0 – 9 = no psychopathy; 10 – 19 = mild psychopathy; 20 – 29 = moderate psychopathy; 30 – 40 = severe psychopathy. I'm not sure if this was ever made public knowledge, but I find it very interesting. BTK scored a 22. A 22 is low for serial killers!!"

serialkillers,2wxk3w,eeebooboo,0,Tue Mar 17 15:34:31 2015 UTC,Interesting.   I suspect the worst part for her would be the sexual aspects of the crimes. She'd have to wonder if he had designs on her or if he treated her mother in a particular way. I'm amazed he didn't kill the son over the table incident. Easy to lose control once those hands go around a neck. Muscle memory is a helluva thing.  I haven't read much on BTK as I don't have anything but disdain for animal torturers and thus can't enjoy their subsequent human depravity. So I was surprised to read that he killed Shirley Vian in front of her kid/s. A true sadist would have killed the children in front of the mother to drag it out. Might have to read a little more about that. See why he did it in that order.
serialkillers,2wxk3w,eeebooboo,7,Thu Mar 5 00:18:56 2015 UTC,It's been awhile since I've read about BTK in depth but I recall reading that the only reason Vian was the sole victim at that scene was because someone kept calling her home phone repeatedly- it made him nervous as he assumed someone was either trying to check up on her or would be trying to now that they weren't able to reach anyone so he took off before he got around to doing everything he'd planned on doing.  Edit: Not really sure why people are downvoting facts but one of many sources: Inside the Mind of BTK by John Douglas and Johnny Dodd.

serialkillers,2wxl9x,dan-paralanguage,3,Tue Feb 24 05:05:35 2015 UTC,"No offense, OP, but I'm afraid my viewing experience was not the same as yours.  This movie is titled Evelenko, and it's a hot mess.  I cannot believe I sat through the whole thing.  It is obviously based on Chikatilo, but has some pretty outlandish flourishes that cause it to become flat out ridiculous.  Beyond the poorly scripted dialogue, you've got plot holes you could drive a  through.  I do not recommend this to anyone solely seeking further insight into Chikatilo.  It is far from instructive in that regard because so many liberties were taken. ""Citizen X"" is a film that more closely follows the investigation.  However, if you enjoy the B-movie experience, and have 103 extra minutes in your day, have at it.  EDIT:  OP, I feel like I was a little rough on this movie, but I thought you might be excited to see another movie that addresses the child murders is coming soon.   An adaptation of a best-selling novel based on the Chikatilo case will be released in April.  Per wiki, ""Child 44"" is a thriller starring Tom Hardy, Noomi Rapace, Gary Oldman, Joel Kinnaman and more.  Perhaps we can share popcorn over that one.  :)"

serialkillers,2wxl9x,reddditcreeper,1 point,Tue Feb 24 15:26:30 2015 UTC,"It is decidedly NOT a documentary.  None of the real names or personal circumstances of the characters are used.    SPOILERS, as if...  What it gets right:  it's set in Russia, the guy's first name is Andrei, he's chronically impotent, his father was in a work camp, Andrei was a teacher at one point and was married, and the number of victims and execution date are identical.  What it gets wrong:  Victimology, MO, cannibalism, the way the victims were lured (seriously - effortless hypnosis is what they went with), the way the confession was obtained (weird psychosexual/hypnosis scene that has Andrei and the lead detective both naked in an interview room), Andrei's marriage and lack of children as well as inability to interact with women, how they caught him, plus there is a weird KGB connection and a murdered psychoanalyst mixed in for good measure."
serialkillers,2wxl9x,Durbee,1 point,Tue Feb 24 18:47:13 2015 UTC,I've read CHild 44 and am looking forward to the movie although the book also took lots of liberties with the story. The reason I found the movie interesting is that it doesn't shy away from pedophilic based murders which I can't think of another movie that does.

serialkillers,2wqjf3,BORINGreposts,9,Sun Feb 22 05:56:16 2015 UTC,"This guy's hatred for his mother baffles me. Why not cut someone so toxic out of your life YEARS before the murders and certainly before killing her. And when he realizes it was her he wanted to kill the entire time, he turns himself in."
serialkillers,2wqjf3,11023517141,10,Sun Feb 22 06:55:54 2015 UTC,Somebody with such severe psychological deviations probably is not capable of thinking of just going no contact and ending a relationship with a toxic person. They may not know it is an option and they are probably mot psychologically healthy enough to realize that this is what they can do.
serialkillers,2wqjf3,BORINGreposts,6,Sun Feb 22 15:47:38 2015 UTC,"He had therapy after his first murders and was advised by professionals to never see her again. Also Kemper had a very high IQ and in his interviews seems to be lucid. His murders spanned over 10 years which would be a very long period of psychosis IMO. But if he was in a psychosis for ten years and finally killed his mother then turn himself in days later would be equally strange. And he manipulated a fellow prisoner using positive reinforcement training. Kemper is a smart guy, I've read he doesn't have schizophrenia so I still wonder how his mother was able to abuse/manipulate him as long as she did."
serialkillers,2wqjf3,Psychopath-,8,Sun Feb 22 18:18:14 2015 UTC,"Actually, he was the one who wanted to keep his distance when he was leaving the hospital, but they released him back into her care.  I don't know. It's always seemed to me like he subconsciously wanted to kill her and so took those compulsions and acted on them in whichever way he felt would be most satisfying. When he finally killed her it was like he'd inadvertently found a way to permanently scratch that itch."
serialkillers,2wqjf3,BORINGreposts,3,Sun Feb 22 20:26:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your insight, I'm curious how subconscious those feeling really were. It seems to me that he knew he wanted to kill his mother but suppressed those feelings."
serialkillers,2wqjf3,11023517141,4,Sun Feb 22 22:17:27 2015 UTC,"I don't mean to say he was suffering some psychosis,  but rather psychopathy and with the neurological deficits that come with psychopathy these more than likely inhibited his ability to rationalize another way to get away from his abusive mother other than killing her. He apparently was very intelligent, but having a high IQ does not change severe emotional reactions and internalization of emotions toward somebody like rage and hatred, especially considering the aforementioned neurological deficits he undoubtedly had. You are right that it is interesting though to see such internalized emotions toward his mother manifest into such severe violence."
serialkillers,2wqjf3,_rattlesnake,3,Sun Feb 22 22:37:13 2015 UTC,"Something that needs clearing up, he didn't turn himself in because he no longer needed to kill.  He thought the police were onto him, it's the entire reason why he chose that time to kill his mother and flee.  He was actually very bothered that nobody was talking about his last kills on the news, he thought for sure the cops that must have been investigating him would find the bodies soon enough.  For a man with such a high IQ, Kemper acted very foolishly in his end.  I bet he thinks about that, a lot."
serialkillers,2wqjf3,LynnTheCat,1 point,Mon Feb 23 08:10:43 2015 UTC,"Yes! I think that too, he loves to talk about the crimes and all the attention, he could have done it ""better"".."

He did cut out the toxic person in a way that seemed like a good idea to him.   His size, is he one of the largest serial killers ever? I wonder why he used weapons to kill when he would not have a problem over powering someone."
serialkillers,2wqjf3,crimsonnate,6,Fri Feb 27 02:54:03 2015 UTC,"His mother was also a victim of his. He decapitated her, violated her head, and then called his mom's best friend to come over so he could kill her too."
serialkillers,2wqjf3,Psychopath-,7,Sun Feb 22 09:48:27 2015 UTC,"Yep. He buried a victim's head in the yard facing the house because his mother ""always wanted someone to look up to her."" And once he'd killed her, he tried to put her vocal cords down the garbage disposal but they got spit back up. He said that was typical- still nagging him, even in death.  He'd gone to one of his outpatient appointments with a severed head in his trunk; the notes from the session talk about how surprisingly well-adjusted he's become. He's one of my favorites."
serialkillers,2wqjf3,screenager_,7,Sun Feb 22 20:31:44 2015 UTC,"He's one of my favourites too, he is extremely intelligent and I find it fascinating how he was able to convince everyone that he was perfectly capable of re-entering society whilst, as you pointed out, turning up to his appointments with severed heads in his car. I also love that he befriended the police and often went out to the local bar to talk and drink with them, he was a crafty one!"

serialkillers,2wqjf3,screenager_,4,Tue May 19 01:41:43 2015 UTC,I'll still never understand why he was released into his mother's custody even after psychiatrists advised that he should never see her again. Things could have been significantly different had he not gone to live with her again. Ed certainly is one of the most interesting killers out there and I just wish there were some more in depth interviews with him.

serialkillers,2wqjf3,Quellieh,6,Sun Feb 22 22:43:03 2015 UTC,"I've read, but can't remember where so I can't provide a source, that he used his time inside very wisely. Making friends with and becoming the assistant of his psychiatrist he was able to read and learn all needed to in order to secure an early release. He was essentially given the tools to act his way into freedom."
serialkillers,2wqjf3,screenager_,2,Mon Feb 23 20:52:27 2015 UTC,"I believe his psychiatrists viewed him as a ""model patient"" and along with his excellent behaviour they also deemed him to be sane.

serialkillers,2wqjf3,BinaryChode,1 point,Sun Feb 22 23:14:26 2015 UTC,"This is exactly what he did, because of his job as an assistant he gained the knowledge of the tests they used and the answers they were looking for. Completely manipulated the system."
serialkillers,2wqjf3,DressesandDolls,3,Fri Feb 27 04:59:20 2015 UTC,Why did he hate his mother so much?
serialkillers,2wqjf3,Psychopath-,7,Sun Feb 22 14:25:11 2015 UTC,"She seemed kinda terrible, even objectively.  He loved his dad and his mom sort of dominated him then drove him away. Because he got big at a young age, she decided there was a chance he'd rape his sister, so she'd force him to stay locked in the basement, just in case. Probably a good case study for the mix of nature vs nurture- he was by all accounts a fairly troubled kid- playing ""gas chamber"", mutilating dolls, and hurting animals- but his environment and upbringing couldn't have helped."
serialkillers,2wqjf3,psycho_watcher,6,Sun Feb 22 20:37:17 2015 UTC,"He talks about it a bit in this interview segment, but it's not too revealing. I'm sure someone else could provide a better reason for why he did it.

serialkillers,2wqjf3,brudos,2,Sun Feb 22 14:56:14 2015 UTC,"I have always thought that Edmund was upset that his murders had gotten so little attention and that they did not upset his mother enough. He was not getting the community and his mother all upset and afraid. That his final act of killing her and her friend in such brutal ways was a sort of tantrum, she ignored him, his crimes but she was going to pay attention now kind of thing.    I remember him saying (sorry, can not remember if it was in a book or interview) that he was killing his mother over and over again. He buried bodies looking at the house by her window, he was definitely thinking of his mom as he killed.    I have to wonder if she ever noticed the crimes. If she ever spoke with him about the murders. If he wasn't killing (in part at least) to get To her. Edmund even took victims (Rosalind Thorpe and Alice Liu) from the school that his mother worked at.   I think he wanted his mother to be afraid, afraid for the students and for herself. I never heard of her paying attention to his crimes at all. That had to have bothered him. Here he was killing students (even girls from the college his mom worked at) and she didn't really react. He wasn't creating a fear in her, he was not getting what he wanted in that way so he killed her directly.   It would also explain why he started to get sloppy and make mistakes. Since the murders weren't fulfilling his need to get at his mom he was killing with more rage."
serialkillers,2wqjf3,brudos,3,Fri Feb 27 02:47:26 2015 UTC,"I think he went so long before being caught was the fact that Kemper befriending many Santa Cruz County police officers. Kemper was a regular at a bar called The Jury Room,[15] which was a popular hangout with local law enforcement officers. None of his friends had any suspicions and they freely discussed the case with him"
serialkillers,2wqjf3,brudos,1 point,Wed Feb 25 13:57:31 2015 UTC,"At 15-years old Kemper turned on his grandparents. He shot his grandmother in the kitchen after an argument. (Some reports also indicate that he stabbed her as well.) When his grandfather returned home, Kemper went outside and shot him by his car and then hid the body. He called his mother who told him to call the police and tell them what happened.  Later, Kemper said that he shot his grandmother to see what it felt like. He added that he killed his grandfather so that the man wouldn't have to find out that his wife had been murdered."

In my top 5 is, without question, 'Wicked Beyond Belief' by Michael Bilton. This book is about the 5 1/2 year killing rampage by British serial killer Peter Sutcliffe which left 13 women dead between 1975 and 1981.  Bilton is a top class journalist as well as author, and knows more about this case than anyone else. The book marries very detailed information about what Sutcliffe did with a great grasp of how to tell a gripping story. Many books on serial killers do one or the other, Bilton does both. The true story is an absolute nail-biter as Sutcliffe keeps killing again and again as the computerless police, drowning in a sea of paper, interview him on 9 separate occasions, failing to realise they have interviewed him over and over already.   Most anguishing moment - when the massive police project to check out all cars seen in multiple red light districts runs out of money with only 6000 cars to go. Sutcliffe's car was in the 6000 remaining cars...."

Just Heard back from don lasseter author of die for me here is what he said  I appreciate your complimentary remarks about my book, ""Die For Me.""  I skimmed through the Murderpedia articles, and find that some of it is erroneous and much of it is exaggerated. I attended the trial of Charles Ng, which lasted nine months, and saw all of the evidence. There were only two short videotapes introduced. One was Lake sitting in a chair, giving his monologue about wanting to capture women and use them as sex slaves. The details of that are in my book, pages 5 through 10. The other, labeled ""M Ladies"" shows Kathleen Allen and Brenda O'Connor. The segment about Kathleen Allen is described on pages 14 through 19, and Brenda O'Connor is on pages 215 through 227. That's all the videos introduced at trial. If other victims were filmed, nothing was ever found, despite extensive searches by detectives. I don't believe there were any more. No one except Cricket knows what she took from the Wilseyville house when she went there before the detectives arrived. The only thing know missing was a few pages from a calendar. Another video tape, not used as evidence, showed Cricket partially nude.   Lake was a peculiar individual, and behaved in anti social ways. I'm not aware of him participating in any cults though. The commune near Ukiah was a peaceful ""hippie haven"" and allegations of sexual parties are unsupported. Years before the murders, he exploited vulnerable young women by photographing them (still shots, not videos) nude or near nude. Quite a few of those pictures were traced by police and the women found safe. Not all of the pictured girls were located, but there was no evidence of any of them being killed.   The Dubs family, two adults and an infant, were murder victims. Lake and Ng stole his video equipment for their personal use. There were certainly no ""stacks of videotapes"" discovered, no salacious orgies recorded, nor any films of the Dubs family.   I haven't read any books by Joel Norris, nor have I heard of one titled ""Horn of the Goat."" And I'm not familiar with the case of David Parker Ray.   I hope this helps answer some of your questions. I think the Internet is a wonderful thing, and a great source of information, but some sites cannot be taken as completely accurate."

(not that I believe you were saying that, specifically.)  I wonder what qualities need to be present for a killer to be seen as more 'sympathetic' to the public eye.

serialkillers,2vid6g,rotmoset,9,Wed Feb 11 06:03:47 2015 UTC,"For the people ITT that says they still believe he has killed people. May I ask you, are you Swedish? Have you been following the intense debate this man has generated over the years? Have you read the numerous books and watched the documentaries that clearly shows that not only is there not a shred of evidence linking him to the crimes except his own stories, but many of the murders were impossible for him to commit (he has ""unused"" alibis).   In short, this whole mess was created by a ""perfect storm"" of pseudo-science in the form of repressed memory therapy and a constant feeded drug addiction (when he ""remembered"" his crimes he got more benzodiazepines by his therapist).  Thankfully, we as country has at least cleared this up by exonerating him from all the murders and released him on probation (because he was not in care because of the murders, but because of previous crimes such as pedophilia and stabbings). He's not a normal man, but I have watched numerous interviews with him in the recent years and he seems to have an healthy view of life. He also very clearly explains his motives about lying on how it snowballed out of his control.  Still, the biggest travesty here is all the real murderers that never got caught and the victims that never got justice. This debt can never be repaid.  In fact, there are very few people in Swedish still defending the notion of him being guilty (mostly the people involved in creating the story, one of them being a judge of the supreme court Göran Lambertz. Because of this, he's now pretty much ignored by Swedish media and he has lost loads of his previous good reputation).  If you understand swedish I urgue you to watch Hannes Råstams excellent documentary which was the beginning to uncover this whole thing (it was the first time Sture Bergwall admitted that he lied). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5NilRLGYg8  Other information that is relevant in this case: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repressed_memory"
serialkillers,2vid6g,rotmoset,2,Wed Feb 11 17:42:13 2015 UTC,"I'm not Swedish, and I don't understand the language, so please bear with me when I ask you these questions.  1) I gather from your post that you are from Sweden? Are there other ways that this has affected your country's ethics regarding psychiatric and legal practices?  2) Do they interview Christianson, the professor that still believes that Bergwall is guilty? Have there been any ramifications as far as he is concerned? Does the documentary mention how he built his theory?"
serialkillers,2vid6g,liberto,3,Wed Feb 11 19:07:56 2015 UTC,"Yes, I'm from Sweden. I'll be happy to answer any questions that I can. I'm not an expert, but I'm very interested in the case and have been following it closely for many years.  I would say that repressed memory therapy is no longer considered a valid form of treatment (at least not in public debate). Another author named Dan Josefsson released a book late 2013 that dealt with this case and the psychatric aspect of it called ""Mannen som slutade ljuga"" (The man who stopped lying). In the book the practice of recalling lost memories on Säter (the hospital were Bergwall was kept) and the almost cult behaviour around it are exposed. Many therapists and other people involved with psychatric care on Säter shared a mentor called Margrit Norell. She was a big proponent of repressed memory therapy and many who worked at Säter saw her as a mother (she was even their therapist in some cases). You can say that she was the intellectual leader of the doctrine being carried out on Säter.  Here's a short google translated article on the subject: https://translate.google.se/translate?sl=sv&tl=en&js=y&prev=_t&hl=sv&ie=UTF-8&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.svt.se%2Fnyheter%2Fsverige%2Fkvinnan-bakom-thomas-quick-1&edit-text=  Norell is not only involved in this case, but also in another huge criminal scandal involving repressed memories (see: The murder of Catrine Da Costa).  Christianson is indeed interviewed over the phone in the documentary I linked above, however he avoids answering questions (as does most of the involved) and has done so ever since.  There has really been no ramifications for anyone involved. I think this is typically Swedish, we'd rather move on and just learn form the experience (not really ok in this instance in my opinion, too much damage has been done).  The main people involved in this mess are the following:   Christer van der Kwast - Main procecutor Seppo Penttinen - Police in charge of the investigation Sven Å. Christianson - Memory expert Birgitta Ståhle - Quick's / Bergwall's therapist. Claes Borgström - ""Defense"" attorney    Interestingly enough, almost all of the above and some others (including Göran Lamberts, who I mentioned in the previous post) have formed what they call ""Quickgänget"" (The Quick Gang) that tries to bring back the notion that he's indeed guilty. Needless to say this is not going well and it's mostly ridiculed in the press."

serialkillers,2vid6g,Prah2013,3,Thu Feb 12 00:31:18 2015 UTC,"Oh no, not at all. To me the article is about several things. One is about the patterns not fitting the crime, ie, he had the background, a professor uses it as an example, but he didn't commit the crimes. That point brings into question the validity of a theory of a common personal background between serial killers.  Another is the serial killer culture being one of sensationalism. Bergwall was caught up in the frenzy and attention given him by professionals, therapists, and those in law enforcement. If he had not received the attention, would he have been as likely to confess to the crimes? I don't think so if that was his primary motivation.  So, while he didn't kill anyone technically, I think this article opened up a discussion about items associated with serial killers: their background as a common ground and the sensationalism that can come about and be part of the culture."

We’re just playing that for public consumption.” When asked Monday about his previous comments, Burton said, “None of that’s true.”  From his Rolling Stone interview, it looks like he was just messing with her for publicity.

Lock them up indefinitely until you have some unqualified jailer decide they're fit for society? Monitor them forever for one assault charge? Lock them up until they die? Put them down just to be safe?  Then where do we draw the line? Under certain circumstances, some places are already allowed to hold violent sex offenders past their sentences if they opted for treatment but are still considered a danger to society. Do we apply this only for sadistic rapists who chose treatment over prison? All sadistic rapists? All rapists? Anyone convicted of a sex crime? How do we arrange the degrees of punishment relative to the crime? Who makes the distinction? Can we trust those decision-makers? Giving anyone that kind of power scares me.   There's a cop who was caught more or less in the process of planning his first murder of what he hoped to be many. You'd think that- like this- would be a victory- we caught a serial killer before they could even start! But it's not. Harsh as it may be, it might've ultimately been better if he'd succeeded that first time and then been caught. Maybe this one too. Then we could lock them away and be glad their victim counts weren't even higher. As it stands, that cop is probably up for release soon. You'd hope, unrealistically, that maybe prison fixed him; maybe he got help and maybe it did some good. If not, you might slightly more realistically expect the law to at least keep close tabs. But for how long? Not only considering the manpower required, but considering the ex-cop himself. How long is fair? We can be almost certain that if prison changed him at all it's not for the better, but the law almost requires we treat him as if it had.  Seriously. What do we do with people like this?  Edit: Clarity."
serialkillers,2v3q0s,liberto,2,Sun Feb 8 00:36:55 2015 UTC,"That's a tough question to answer. I think we, as society, need to create outlets for people like this, so that they can release the cravings that build up. I imagine in the olden days, there were proper outlets for them such as hand to hand combat or as a warrior for a tribe (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoamine_oxidase_A#Aggression_and_the_.22Warrior_gene.22), greater access to hunting game (where one could feasibly and lawfully release their energy), and opportunities for social isolation, where temptations might be tempered by lack of opportunity to commit violence against others. As our population rises, urbanization and the human density there within, increases. That's inherently problematic for those who suffer from psychopathy. There's also societal constraints on the occupation one can pursue. For example, should someone be arrested for larceny or theft, their employment opportunities are greatly diminished. This means, the young sociopath can't necessarily climb a corporate ladder as easily nor have the same opportunities afforded that those with more socially accepted genetics have been. So, we'd need some extreme movement from our current political and societal climate to create an environment that would allow more of us to co-exist. Part of the irony is that many of our politicians and corporate leaders, who shape policy and this current climate, are sociopaths. They lack the empathy to give a shit about those who might share the same afflictions as them, but without the affluent and spoon-fed opportunities they experienced."
serialkillers,2v3q0s,inlovewithaghoul,3,Sun Feb 8 00:55:10 2015 UTC,"This is what I've had to learn. I was lucky as a teenager to have a mentor who sort of understood me and tried to help me become a functional member of society without telling me I was fucked up or demanding I change.  I have a couple legal outlets- including hunting- but it's not the same. I'm fortunate that I'm at a point where the confluence of my desire to remain free, my uncertainty at how well I could avoid being identified, and my handful of murder-substitutes results in an ability (or even just desire) to control my impulses. I also have a couple outlets that are probably on the border of legality but none of them involve hurting other people so I justify them as the lesser of many evils.  It's just strange to see articles like these and contemplate them from the perspective of what kind of freedom I would expect to retain in such a situation while realizing both society's right to some basic level of safety and the oddity of law enforcement being almost in the position of thought police if allowed to react in accordance with the way the suspect intended to act instead of only what he was at that time able to accomplish.   That being said... anyone whose own mother knows they aspire to be a serial killer is bound to fuck up quickly and badly.  Edit: Clarity."

He confessed to the attempted murders of two prominent men: the magazine publisher Larry Flynt in 1978 and Vernon Jordan, Jr., the civil rights activist, in 1980. Both survived their injuries, but Flynt was left permanently paralyzed from the waist down. Franklin was not convicted in either of those cases.  Because Franklin repeatedly changed his accounts of some crimes, and was not charged in some cases in which he was suspected, officials cannot determine the full extent of his crimes. His claims of racial motivation were offset by a defense expert witness who testified in 1997 that Franklin was a paranoid schizophrenic who was not fit to stand trial.

On 22 July 2011, he killed eight people by setting off a van bomb amid government buildings in Oslo, then shot dead 69 participants of a Workers' Youth League (AUF) summer camp on the island of Utøya.   In August 2012 he was convicted of mass murder, causing a fatal explosion, and terrorism.    On the day of the attacks, Breivik electronically distributed a compendium of texts entitled 2083: A European Declaration of Independence, describing his far-right militant ideology.     In them, he lays out a worldview encompassing Islamophobia, support for ""far-right Zionism""  and opposition to feminism.   The texts call Islam and Cultural Marxism ""the enemy"", argue for the violent annihilation of ""Eurabia"" and multiculturalism and advocate deportation of all Muslims from Europe based on the model of the Beneš decrees.   Breivik wrote that his main motive for the atrocities was to market his manifesto.   Two teams of court-appointed forensic psychiatrists examined Breivik before his trial. The first report diagnosed Breivik as a paranoid schizophrenic.  A second psychiatric evaluation was commissioned following widespread criticism of the first.  The second evaluation was published one week before the trial; it concluded that Breivik was not psychotic during the attacks nor during the evaluation.  He was instead diagnosed as having narcissistic personality disorder.  His trial began on 16 April 2012, with closing arguments made on 22 June 2012.

One theory was that Bundy slipped her a container with his sperm in it and she inseminated herself. Another theory is that guards allowed them to do the deed during visits. She got pregnant and gave birth to a little girl. Bundy has a daughter out there somewhere. She changed her name and disappeared. Can't say I blame her.

serialkillers,2uscx5,CharliesAngelSOA,2,Thu Feb 5 03:38:24 2015 UTC,He definitely should have been caught a lot sooner then he was. I read a book recently about him. Some fellow nurses knew what he was doing. They could even prove that he was the one taking the extra meds from the drug room. They never turned him in because they were told that the hospital didn't want the bad publicity. He would just quit or get fired and move on to the next hospital. That is probably why the families of the victims sued. They should have done something about him when they first found out. It would have saved lives.

We probably won't be able to ever find out everything and the identity of all of his victims unfortunately. It's a shame.

Mind you back in the early 70's through early 80's Chicago was an unorganized war-zone of criminals, rapes, murders, thefts, just like New York. I have a good friend whose uncles were gangbangers in that area and held it down by Senn High school and just hearing their stories really sends chills down the spine. Also that area by the Aragon Ballroom is called Uptown its still is really quiet bad over there but not as bad as it used to be. It's was an area full of indigents, drug addicts, criminals, murders, rapist, drug dealers, mentally disturbed folks everywhere, I mean you name everything scary, filthy, and unnerving it was and still is(to an extent) Uptown. These days a lot of hipsters in the area but you still couldn't pay me to live over there."

I really think we need to focus on creating policies (and jobs) to address the systemic issues raised. Why can't we assign cops to process back logged DNA and ensure preservation of evidence for unidentified remains instead of making them perform stop and frisks to meet illegal quotas?  I think we if we re-prioritize and address these ""mass silent tragedies"" in the system, police and community relations would improve and the tax payer support (and funding) will be there.  Nobody wants to be hassled by authorities without cause, but everyone wants the police to be proactive and supportive when their loved ones go missing."

That word is a derivative of morality, which is itself a subjective matter. /u/LinuxLinux is spot on when he says, ""This strikes me as fairly arbitrary"". Murderers and serial killers have diverse environmental and biological backgrounds that influenced their decision-making. Are they absent of free-will as a result? Not necessarily, but that leaves the entire weight and assignment of ""evil"" as a muddled, or even inarguable system."
serialkillers,2tr33v,anticiperectshun,2,Tue Jan 27 03:48:22 2015 UTC,Agreed. With the amount of neurocognitive research coming out it does seem to muddle the idea of evil.
serialkillers,2tr33v,Coaste12ama,2,Tue Jan 27 17:16:15 2015 UTC,"Couldn't agree more. Stone is out to sell his brand to people who like pop psychology and don't think too deep into the ""science"" of things."
serialkillers,2tr33v,KANNABULL,8,Tue Jan 27 17:47:25 2015 UTC,"I've always had an issue with Stone's gradient, he seems to favor a nurture progression into sociopathy rather than remaining completely objective. The first thing he discusses with each serial killer is their childhood, from my experience and most modern evidence now coming to light I think inherently evil people can only be determined on an individual basis. Environment plays its role but to completely disregard mental illness hereditary traits is foolish especially considering more recent killers like Tyler Hadley and Jake Evans, both of whom targeted family exclusively and had zero environmental factors of influence. Evans blamed his actions on a movie, Hadley said he wanted to throw a party, surely this is a sign that evil and the actions of evil play a larger role than environment and have more to do with psychosis than how someone is raised or the issues they face.   I also remember reading an article of Stone claiming that Adam Lanza was far more evil than Jefferey Dahmer. I'm not arguing that, it may well be true, but an action can only be as evil as a previously existing action. I think Stone was just using the Newtown incident to promote his 'gradient', it just seems like shooting up a school full of children is not the sign of someone demented and evil but the act of a coward that sees glory in the unthinkable.  Either way classifying MO and history cannot really sum up how evil someone is, think of all the people who have not been caught. The only way to truly gradient anything is to collect all known possibilities and then judge them anything else is just educated speculation."
serialkillers,2tr33v,Coaste12ama,4,Tue Jan 27 01:27:19 2015 UTC,"Stone is full of shit. A scale of evil?  You don't need a psych degree to understand how absurd this notion is.

serialkillers,2tr33v,anticiperectshun,1 point,Tue Jan 27 17:41:40 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I think I'd argue that shooting up a school can be seen as demented - however may not be within the realm of psychopathic or not guilty by reason of insanity. I agree that it's cowardly, though. It's just that I think there may be influences or unreasonable conclusions that they have drawn that lead to their actions.   The Virginia Tech shooter Seung-Hui Cho had some motives fueled by Christianity (in his own mind) but had so much foresight into his crime that I don't think one could argue he was insane. He had a strange childhood with loads of anxiety. In his videos he talks about being a martyr, like Christ and he talks about those around campus and the effect they have on him. The glorification is certainly there.   Elliot Rodgers is another example, who's ideas could be seen as delusions. He felt actively spurned by women and carried out his shootings with a revenge motive.   Also, out of curiosity, what is your experience? I'm getting my MA in forensic psych and this is fascinating to me."

serialkillers,2tr33v,anticiperectshun,1 point,Tue Jan 27 18:44:25 2015 UTC,"Well, I did a psychology for my major, so I guess I never really looked into what my grad school required, outside of the GRE, GPA, etc. requirements. A friend of mine got a bachelor's in poli sci and moved onto CPU science after taking 3 or 4 classes in between, so I guess check the requirements for a program you'd like to get in.   I Will caution, I've had some trouble finding a job using my bachelors in psych. Definitely look into a minor to supplement (I'd recommend CPU science, it'll be good for research, or even business bc it'll look good with your humanitarian background). Luckily, I got a job that is flexible with me enough te Work part time semesters and full time semesters. It's not anywhere near what I want, but it puts me through school, which is crazy cheap for me bc It's a state school (and a very good forensic psych program that works with the police and FBI).  I'd say, if you go This route, definitely look into taking the research methods and stats classes as high as they go (my school has two levels even though I took them in under grad). Learn to love the research, and you can gear yourself to What you like. With the MA you can be trained to give the PCL-R (psychopathy), MMPI (personality), and other measures. You can Also be an expert witness, but probably won't be sought after like someone with a PhD.   I'm looking to go into law enforcement and Should be entering soon (which Will reimburse my classes, so I'll probably go PhD too). Do your research if It's something you want bc a secretary at my job has an MA in forensic psych and that terrifies me. I suspect she didn't go as in depth into research though. Look into aiding research too. It'll be a big boost."

serialkillers,2tr33v,KANNABULL,1 point,Wed Jan 28 15:48:33 2015 UTC,"I find Dr. Stone's scale to be useful. His criteria is judged on much more than their background and crimes. Being that he is a psychiatrist (not psychologist), he actually focuses largely on mental illness, traumatic brain injury defect, personality disorders and neurological abnormality from a medical standpoint-- all of which determine behavior patterns. He has stated that Noel Doorbal is one of the worst criminal cases he has ever heard of (that position being tied with John Weber) and Doorbal does not come from a traumatic past. The scale is to show how potentially dangerous a person is after factoring all relevant criteria. People who degrade the scale simply do not understand it, and they are not open to the fact that the scale is made from a psychiatric standpoint in regards to forensics. I have not read the article referenced in this post but based on the replies I'm assuming it is about Dr Stone's scale."
serialkillers,2tr33v,KANNABULL,1 point,Wed Jan 28 14:34:36 2015 UTC,"Sure it can be useful, I'm not disputing that fact, it's just that his documentary I saw, I rented it at the library. I think it's called Most Evil, it came in six separate DVDs if I remember right. He makes it clear through his dialogue that nurture presides over nature in the evolution of mental degradation of a sociopath as he goes from 1 to 21. His observations are poignant and very well articulated but they are more opinion than fact making the scale one of disassociation rather than implementation. I suppose I'm just indulging in my own opinion here though, creating a scale of evil itself is fundamentally flawed as well it gives the potential narcissist sociopath a predetermined goal to work towards if you think about it."
serialkillers,2tr33v,KANNABULL,0,Wed Jan 28 15:00:37 2015 UTC,"Well with ""Most Evil"" you only get as much as they can cram in the time frame, so they just give you the meat, if you will. You don't see the research and construction Dr. Stone has actually put into these cases. You get the entertaining version with the actual research. I have studied Dr. Stone's work in depth and I have never been under the impression nature plays a bigger role over nurture or visa versa in his construction or results. I think he goes off only what is exhibited by the offender and where that ranks on a predetermined chart. Like I said Noel Doorbal was almost strictly a case of nature. Dr. Stone has stated that this is one of the most depraved modern criminals due to that. His observations are opinion, of course, as is anyone's including others in the medical field that may or may not agree with him, but his extensive education and work on the subject makes his opinion credible. Also a narcissistic sociopath who truly understands the scale can't work towards it, in order to do that they would have to be intelligent enough to successfully manufacture quite a bit about them-self and their behavior. Like I said a lot of people don't really understand the scale. With saying that a narcissistic sociopath who claims to use the scale as a means of achievement is merely using the scale as an excuse to erroneously compare themselves with.  Source: I've had extensive conversations with over 50 serial killers, mass murderers, etc., studied violent crime and multiple violent crime offenders for several years, I have profiled serial killer cold cases and worked with a leading profiler in the field, I have consulted on projects that have been featured on the Dr. Phil show and Investigation Discovery-- said project also involves a former FBI supervisory agent of the behavioral analysis unit."
serialkillers,2tr33v,tagusan,1 point,Wed Jan 28 15:29:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the insight, maybe I'll read his book when I get the chance to get a better understanding of the methodology. What I meant with the scale is that glorification now plays a role in the decisive nature of serial killers. If it's in their ritual to achieve a higher ranking than their predecessors they need only to push their limits according to a set factor the scale of evil could be used as that set factor. Where a killer may not usually dismember or mutilate a corpse, they may compare themselves to another serial killer under the impression that they will not get as much limelight if they do not perform a certain act that puts them on the same rank as the serial killer is set on Stone's scale. Like maybe the killer did not want to dismember the corpse but did so under the impression that he would get more media attention. I don't really see how they would manufacture an act they have already committed, but compared to you I'm no expert. I still think it's probably not that great of an idea to create a scale even if it does serve a purpose for good it could be just as damaging in my opinion."
serialkillers,2tr33v,ScruffledNuts,0,Wed Jan 28 16:39:19 2015 UTC,"maybe the killer did not want to dismember the corpse but did so under the impression that he would get more media attention   I have yet to encounter a serial killer who has acted in this way, not to say it can't happen, but I don't believe it has, it's not common with serial offenders. Anything a serial killer does somehow provides them with personal fulfillment.   If it's in their ritual to achieve a higher ranking than their predecessors they need only to push their limits according to a set factor the scale of evil could be used as that set factor   Again, I have yet to encounter a serial killer that was specifically trying to outdo a high profile serial killer while commuting their crimes. Most serial killer conduct themselves in a way that is suiting for them, they don't perform any act on their victims that is uncharacteristic to them for the sake of any fame or specifically to outdo another. Also admiration amongst serial killers is not as common as most think, that is more often the case with rampage killers trying to score a higher body count. Serial killers usually lie, take credit for other crimes, act colder and meaner AFTER the fact for those reasons, assuming they care.   I don't really see how they would manufacture an act they have already committed   For example, Maybe they are a disorganized style serial offender who acts impulsively for the purpose of robbery, which is lower on the scale than an organized serial killer who tortures their victims for sexual gratification, so they would have to manufacture organization, a sexual element, and torture, which they can not because forensics will tell the story.    idea to create a scale even if it does serve a purpose for good it could be just as damaging in my opinion   I highly doubt a scholar serial killer will go out of their way to commit crimes to specifically rank on  Dr. Stone's scale of evil. It's just not likely. In my experience it is more likely that a serial killer does what they do for their personal reasons and lie or brag after the fact to make them SEEM like more accomplished serial killers, assuming that they even care about the perception of them (a lot do not want to be seen as worse than what they are, quite the opposite actually).

If everything factual op said is actually a fact, I'd say that the guy is definitely hiding something. But I've had things before from loved ones, obviously not serial killing, and I may be perceived by others similar to how op sees his dad.   It could be a million things. It will be interesting to see where this goes because if op is willing to violate his father's privacy as much as he has and plans on violating it more (a GPS tracker ffs) he'll almost surely get to the bottom of it. Hope he's ready for whatever he finds.   My advice would be to leave the guy alone unless you have some solid reason to be looking into him. It's not illegal to look at porn and be an asshole, but it's  somewhat unethical to violate a person's privacy like that without a solid reason.   Regardless, hope op is careful.

To me, It seems very likely that he is going to the pub. He certainly isn't going out to kill someone every night, otherwise the missing people and found bodies would never be out of the news in your area.  Serial killers are pretty rare. There are about a thousand explanations much more likely to explain your father's strange behaviour. He could be into some kind of porn he doesn't want anyone finding out about (child, bestiality, rape, those fake snuff films that look real, that thing where women kill puppies and kittens with high heels, etc). Your dad could simply be massively depressed and withdrawn (you mention that he used to be a medical student in his youth and then you later say that he spends all day on the PC. Does he work? If so, is it in a much less prestigious field? What you see as a murderous personality could just be a severely depressed or bitter, resentful person who is unhappy with his lot in life). Your dad could have a girlfriend or even an entire family on the side. He could have some kind of addiction (alcohol, gambling, so on). There are so many things that could be going on that distance a person from their family and doesn't involve murdering people.  Here are the key points of your post: Dad watches a lot of porn, dad is withdrawn and uncommunicative, dad has an extra phone he keeps a secret from his family (why would a serial killer need this??), dad leaves every evening, claiming to be at the pub, but you don't think he's really at the pub, dad spends all day on the 'net and then deletes part of his browsing history.  To me this says he's having an affair before it says he's killed anyone.  Do not get caught spying on your father. You obviously don't have a great relationship and he and your mother don't seem to have a very good relationship and it sounds to me like he's already half checked-out as it is, finding out that his son/daughter is putting GPS trackers on his car and checking his search history on his PC will not do much to improve things between the three of you."

However, from what you've said he seems to have some sociopathic traits and I bet he wouldn't be so happy with you digging through his stuff.  Also, if he is a serial killer you have to assume that he will protect himself at any cost. A lot of serial killers don't feel love or empathy, they wouldn't mind hurting or killing their family.

serialkillers,2tjlmw,badnewsbernie,5,Sun Jan 25 03:19:45 2015 UTC,"Dude's cheating.   My dad was a serial adulterer and I didn't find out until after I left for college. He'd go on business trips (legitimate ones) and many were to Vegas where he was working on a project. Apparently he has a taste for call girls and had the audacity to ""review"" his experience with several on some escort website. That's how my mom busted him. He would also hang out in a communal family area of the house in the middle of the day with the door locked and when I'd knock, it would take him awhile to traverse the 20 feet from the computer to the door to unlock it and ask me what I wanted. He kept an extensive stash of playboy and hustler magazines in a hidden nook in this room. Frequented an embarrassing number of strip clubs when he was supposed to be coming home from the airport or running errands. We actually thought he died or got in a bad wreck once because he called to say his flight got in and he was on his way home but home was 45 minutes away and after about 6 hours without him making it home and his cell phone going to voicemail, we started calling hospitals and the airport. Not dead. Just at a strip club. He hired escorts in our town. They offered ""the girlfriend experience"" so you can pretend a hot woman wants to spend time with you instead of just getting paid to have sex with you. He'd tell my sister and I that he had a business trip when sometimes, he flew somewhere other than where he told us and other times he just got a hotel a couple towns over and hooker'd it up there. He even met a woman from another continent on the internet, lavished her with expensive gifts and money for months and then flew her into the airport near our town and spent the weekend with her. Meanwhile, we thought he was in like New Jersey or something and my mom was out of town taking care of her mother who was under hospice care. And he'd get real bitchy if my mom picked up his phone or even looked like she was considering doing so.   Everything you describes sounds pretty much like the sketchy shit I noticed my dad was up to before I found out about the affairs and the stuff that I learned after the fact that made a lot more sense in retrospect.   Man-whore is far more likely than serial killer. Unless he has an industrial wood chipper or a secret basement murder room with meat hooks and a drain in the floor. Then I'd lean more towards serial killer."

I'm hoping your dad isn't a serial killer, and it doesn't seem like he is there are a lot of other, more likely scenarios. I guess if you want to be more careful without involving the law you could snoop a little more, most computers save most information that's deleted (or searched incognito), and if you are seriously worried, I would say maybe (seriously maybe) find a keylogger that's well hidden and see what he searches/deletes (make sure your dad won't be able to figure it out tho).

Killed about 11 in all from 1927-1954. 31 kills.  Honora Kelley AKA ""Jane Toppan"" was a nurse, who between 1885-1901, experimented on her patients with morphine, seeing how close she could bring them to death before bringing them back.  Amy D.

The victims were five children aged between 10 and 17—Pauline Reade, John Kilbride, Keith Bennett, Lesley Ann Downey and Edward Evans—at least four of whom were sexually assaulted. The murders are so named because two of the victims were discovered in graves dug on Saddleworth Moor; a third grave was discovered on the moor in 1987, more than 20 years after Brady and Hindley's trial in 1966. The body of a fourth victim, Keith Bennett, is also suspected to be buried there, but despite repeated searches it remains undiscovered.

serialkillers,2sqtev,UrUntouchableFace,3,Mon Jan 26 22:39:54 2015 UTC,Thank you for coming forward.  I work for Dirge magazine and I am intrigued (by serial killers and hybristophiles). I'd have to agree with you about the posts on tumblr.   Would you be interested in doing a follow up interview on Dirge magazine to show your perspective on the matter? It would be 100% anonymous.  Please PM me if you want to set it up?
serialkillers,2sqtev,concretegirl87,1 point,Sun Jan 18 05:15:14 2015 UTC,"Did you write that article? It was very well-written. I'm interested in psychology and am not attracted to violent men or serial killers but find the human mind and resulting actions fascinating. Fwiw, most of the men I have been with have been narcissistic, violent, demeaning, or sociopathic even. I don't seek them out so I find women who would go out of their way to be with men who are known for or get off on abuse, rape, murder, violence to be interesting and yet very problematic (it's hard for me to understand them). I think most of those hybristophiles (sp?) have never been with an abusive, violent, over dominating man who demands and manipulates and that is where this worship comes from. It is also shocking and subversive so that is also part of the allure. The taboo heightens it, I'm sure. As someone who has been in relationships with cold and violent men, I am fascinated and repulsed by such fangirls."

serialkillers,2sqtev,Twatwaffle83,4,Wed Jan 21 01:14:59 2015 UTC,"Very late reply. I've almost always been attracted to serial killers. More of a fantasy than anything. In films (horror movies etc.) I tend to develop sexual/intimate fantasies for the killer. It started very young. I watched the film Eye for an Eye when I was nine and found Kiefer Sutherland attractive because he was just so dominant. I'm 24 now and still have these attractions.  I've written stories about it, as a creative outlet. But I also find Ted Bundy attractive (A lot of women do) He is my favourite serial killer looks wise.   In real life however, I would never date a serial killer or a violent person. In role-play it's fine, but I'd never allow myself to be in a dangerous position.  This topic has always been an interest to me as well, in a sense I understand why women fall in love with killers or criminals, particularly if they are in jail/death row. I'd describe it as a thrill, and in a weird way being in control of the relationship. Also from another perspective it would be the feeling that a killer is attracted to you, wants to be intimate with you when he hurts other people. You alone bring out his ""soft side"" so to speak.  He could be seen as manly, macho and strong. So in a fucked up way, women feel safe with someone who has so much control over someone else's life. Of course in reality this usually ends terribly."

I live in Manchester, And I walk the canals quite often, Mostly at night. I've seen numerous people fall in, Get pushed in and climb out by themselves. I've fallen in whilst intoxicated and been able to get myself out.  I don't believe what the police say, There is a serial killer in Manchester.   Why do I not believe them?   Because when it comes to violent crimes, The Manchester Police aren't as good as they used to be. They're focusing on weed dealers in the city center way to much, And not on the real problems facing this city."
serialkillers,2s8yk1,BowChickaWow-Wow,2,Tue Jan 13 06:07:43 2015 UTC,Can you explain the canal to us? I have a tough time believing that so many people would perish falling into the canal--hypothermia or not. What are the demographics of the neighborhood it's in? It seems like negligence on the part of local officials to not at the very least have cameras with so many deaths occurring.
serialkillers,2s8yk1,liberto,7,Tue Jan 13 08:02:28 2015 UTC,"Not OP, but I also live in Manchester. The canal runs through the Gay Village, which is basically a place where all the gay nightclubs and bars are. Pretty much 50% of the people there are on some form of drug, and usually pretty drunk as well. The canal has a barrier that's about 1m tall on both sides, and there's a small bridge across it which also has a barrier.   I'm actually quite surprised myself at the lack of cameras, though given the nature of the area it's perhaps a sensitivity issue.   Honestly, I really wouldn't be surprised if they were all accidents. The UK has a serious culture of binge drinking, and the Gay Village especially so. When you're black out drunk, it's probably a lot easier to accidentally fall in, and a damn site harder to get yourself out.  Here's a Google Maps Streetview of the place in question: link"

serialkillers,2s8yk1,camouflage365,6,Wed Jan 14 08:37:35 2015 UTC,"I understand that people are often drunk or drugged and that therefore accidents happen but if you look at the figures they're just too high for that to be the only explanation.  Consider the number of canal deaths in Amsterdam where the canals are much more open (and therefore easier to fall into) versus the number in Manchester and things start to look even more suspicious.  Nobody can claim that people in Manchester are likely to be more drunk or drugged than people in Amsterdam yet we're supposed to believe that more people die accidentally in Manchester, somehow getting past the barriers?   Something doesn't add up!"
serialkillers,2s8yk1,BendyZebra,5,Tue Jan 13 10:48:26 2015 UTC,more people die accidentally in Manchester   That's not what the figures say.  61 in Manchester in 6 years = 10.6 per year. 51 in amsterdam in 3 years = 17 per year.  Almost twice as many dying in Amsterdam.

serialkillers,2rmolf,Psychopath-,2,Thu Jan 8 08:24:08 2015 UTC,"I'm aware that to be considered legally insane you have to be either unaware that your actions were wrong or so incapacitated that you were unable to conform to what you knew was right. I just recall coming across two or three serial killers that seemed to fit the definition. Richard Trenton Chase was another, and one that I will stand by- if Ed Gein got the rest of his life in an asylum, Chase should have as well. Of course things like hiding the bodies or weapon(s), etc. more or less automatically disqualify you from an insanity plea. At the very least it seemed that before Wuornos was put to death she didn't fully understand the consequences and from what I know, the inmate at the time of their execution isn't fit to be executed if they can't comprehend the implications. Of course it could have been an act and this is something I'm vaguely remembering from watching one of the documentaries years ago, which is why I didn't argue the point."
serialkillers,2rmolf,liberto,1 point,Thu Jan 8 13:45:44 2015 UTC,She fully understood the circumstances surrounding her execution. She knew she was being executed by the state of Florida for a crime she was convicted of. She was paranoid at the time that guards were abusing her but that doesn't mean she didn't appreciate her execution. She also thought she was going into a spaceship after she died but that's no more delusional than thinking you are going to heaven or hell or whatever else you perceive to happen after death. She was mentally ill but not insane and was mentally fit to be executed by definition of the law.

serialkillers,2rgrlh,Psychopath-,2,Tue Jan 6 01:51:39 2015 UTC,"Especially considering he was nearly released.   Edit: I have a question for you, since you're knowledgeable on the subject. Is there anything in particular that causes a serial killer to use multiple methods of killing, like Watts? Is it a case of convenience?  Does it mean they began without a preference and they're evolving or adapting to a weapon or method that suits them better after some experimentation? Does it mean the actual method is secondary to some other aspect? I'm guessing that's one of those things that depend on the specific case. If I were going to kill someone, I know exactly how I would do it. I'm sure I could change minor details to fit the reality of the situation, but altering something as significant as the weapon of choice seems like it would risk devaluing the entire experience, so I'm curious as to why that variation might happen."
serialkillers,2rgrlh,fauxphantom,5,Tue Jan 6 04:40:11 2015 UTC,"some serial killers are disorganized, the manor of the homicide can change. Some organized serial killers who have the same method of killing can change according to circumstance. Organized serial killers usually have a preferred method of killing but not always, that is because the way in which they use to kill doesn't provide a psychological stamp for them any more than another method (or just as much as other methods). Also the thing in most serial killers, especially organized ones, M.O. Can and does change, the signature does not. The signature is something the killer has to do psychologically to complete the crime but it's not necessary.   Watts' had a violent rage towards women and enjoyed killing them, much like a young child burning ants with a magnifying glass. He killed them however he could and he was very effective at it. He trolled almost obsessively for victims. When he found a woman in the wrong place at the wrong time he killed them. Any woman would serve as a victim because he thought they were all evil, and he got his kicks from flat out killing them.   I own a few lengthy letters from Watts and when speaking to or about a woman his tone changes and seemingly uncontrollable rage spews from him. He is very degrading to them, not in a macho way that men are superior, but no matter how superior or inferior men are, women are inferior to men and beneath them. If he could he would kill every woman on the planet one by one any way he could as long as they were dead. That was his objective."

Okay, maybe not all are, but some psychopaths' brains are literally physically different. There's some discussion of whether or not the brain could change to what you see in psychopaths as a result of early environmental factors, but to just say ""serial killers are a product of their environment, period,"" seems disingenuous.  Second, ""don't be a hooker"" is really shitty advice. Ted Bundy killed college girls. So did Edmund Kemper. So did Danny Rolling. BTK killed people in their homes. So did Richard Ramirez.

However, your chances are greatly increased living a high risk lifestyle (drugs, prostitution, or any other factor that enables and promotes victimization towards you). Your risk factor can increase even with your race or class status. If you are a black girl from the ghetto and go missing, you won't get as much attention as a well-to-do white girl who goes missing.

He later assaulted one of the house's tenants. In 1978, Heidnik had his first child, a daughter named Maxine, with his girlfriend and later abducted her sister Alberta (who was also mentally disabled) from an institution in Harrisburg.   and   On December 3, 1986, Heidnik abducted the mentally-disabled Sandra Lindsay, whom he had gotten pregnant previously, but she had an abortion, which angered him.   The Crime Library source says:   As Sandy spoke to Josefina began to understand why the new arrival seemed so detached, she was retarded.  Sandy told Josefina that she had been a friend of Heidnik's for several years since they had met at the Elwyn Institute, which was a local hospital for the mentally and physically handicapped.   However, neither give their own sources and both claim that Heidnik fed one of the dead captives to the others, which the Wikipedia article says was a lie told to bolster an insanity plea, according to his defense attorney.

Police at the time believed Jack the Ripper was intimately familiar with Whitechapel, which is why he seemed to be able to disappear so quickly. Besides, both Holmes and the Ripper had really specific MOs with just about zero overlap. It's near unheard of for a serial killer to change their routine so drastically. I'm sure there are arguments to be made for why it might be just barely within the realm of possibility for them to have been the same person, I just think it's so insanely unlikely that it might as well be impossible.

Passenger lists, immigration or emigration records? Also, a quick perusal (haven't quite the time to listen to the podcast at the moment) shows that one of the biggest pieces of 'evidence' for this is an apparent match between Holmes' handwriting and Jack the Rippers. The problem here of course is we don't have a sample of Jack the Ripper's handwriting. There is no proof whatsoever that any of the letters are from the killer, even the 'From Hell' letter."
serialkillers,2rcbwx,Quietuus,2,Mon Jan 5 03:24:29 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Handwriting and the letter-writing paraphernalia  used were also part of the argument for Walter Sickert being the Ripper.

He says that we do know that his close friend (and partner in crime) from the University of Michigan was English. His father was apparently a politician and they lived in...Whitechapel. The author claims that Holmes visited his friend and his family fairly often. He say he would like to get copies of the ship manifests going there during around the time of the ripper killings, but Scotland Yard won't give them to him.  In any case, Holmes had a shit ton of aliases, so I don't know if it would be relevant.  As far as the letters, he claims that between the time the the Dear Boss letter was written and the time it was open to the public,  Eddowes was killed and her ear was taken, which is what he says he'll do in the letter. Therefore, at least this letter is real.  I don't know. The biggest problem I have is that the murders are so different, with different MO's.

I'm sure they are exploring the possibility of connections but as of now there really isn't any proof. Only speculative theory.   Some authorities are interested in closing cases but to make a broad generalization that all of them are is incorrect.   Also authorities are pretty good about giving the media pertinent information in regards to a fragile ongoing serial killer case without jeopardizing the case or potential sensitive aspects of the case. They usually alert the public but not in great detail because it is an open investigation and their top priority is to catch the offender(s). To say the public is notified only when the killer addresses the public is so painfully inaccurate.

One of the 15 shots that really rang out in her home in Pampa, Texas, grazed her leg and arm. The others killed were Robin’s mother, stepfather and brother. The lone gunman then fled into the night.  Doan, then just 10 years old, played dead before making a chilling call to 911, telling the operator, “There was a shoot-out in my house and I don’t know who’s dead. And I’m scared half to death.” She survived the vicious attack that destroyed her family and recounts that night and her recovery in 48 HOURS: LIVE TO TELL: ""Sole Survivor,” to be broadcast Jan. 3, 2015 (10:00 PM, ET/PT) on the CBS Television Network.  “I was having a nightmare,” Doan says, “and I remember hearing gunshots in my dream, but when I woke up it didn’t end. The gunshots were actually going off in my house. My mother started screaming. Screaming and screaming.”  Anchored by correspondent Erin Moriarty, 48 HOURS: LIVE TO TELL: “Sole Survivor” features Doan’s inspiring story of survival and recovery following a night that changed her life forever.  “He turned to my brother’s room,” says Doan, now 20. “And I just remember gunshots going off and my brother moaning.”  Before the night of Sept. 30, 2005, Doan was a typical 10-year-old girl in a hardworking family of farmers. Then, through some random, unexplainable moment of fate, they became the targets of an intruder who enjoyed killing for the thrill of it.  “You ask the question why. And that’s the question that sometimes haunts you forever,” says former Hemphill County, Texas Sheriff Gary Henderson. “Why? Why this family? Why this day? Why this town? And we may never know.”  The immediate investigation turned up few clues, but they wouldn’t give up. Doan, remarkable in her ability to recall details in spite of her age and the trauma of having lost her family repeatedly recounted what she heard, and saw. “He shot in my room and missed me.”  In a videotaped interview, Doan’s courage is breathtaking. “And so I had to pretend like I was dead two whole hours.”  She was placed in a safe place in case the killer came back to get the lone witness to the horrific crime.  “There was one theory that it was a drug hit that had got the wrong house,” says Texas Ranger Jay Foster. “All of the leads were hitting dead ends.”  What investigators would later learn was that the gunman who killed Doan’s family had killed before, though hundreds of miles away in Missouri. Just a day before Doan’s family was attacked, Orlie McCool and his daughter-in-law, Dawn, were killed, and the McCool’s Dodge pickup was stolen. Levi King was later found behind the wheel of that same stolen truck by the Border Patrol in El Paso. There, he soon told law enforcement that there were four more bodies in Texas. Law enforcement in El Paso then alerted colleagues in Missouri they had King in custody.  King told law enforcement officers that the feeling he got from killing the McCools was better than the high he’d gotten from any drugs he had ever done. Two weeks later, King told law enforcement about four more murders he committed in Texas.  It was the lead that investigators in Pampa desperately needed to find the person who killed Doan’s family. Doan was willing to help by testifying about the night her family was senselessly gunned down while they slept.  “I was going to be sitting in front of a murderer who had killed my loved ones,” Doan says. “And to testify – I didn’t want to. But I needed to for my family’s sake. I was the only one that got to walk out of that house. They didn’t, and they needed a voice.”  A deputy sheriff who responded to the home after the shooting, investigators, prosecutors and Robin Doan’s friend, Denise Mackie, intimately describe their initial response to the shooting, the investigation, King’s trial, and the years since as Doan has continued on with life without her loved ones.  Birthdays, she says, are particularly hard.  “Even my birthday is hard because I don’t like celebrating it without them,” Doan says. “I just have those days where I want my mommy, or I want my stepdad, or I want my brother, and want things to go back to being normal, and you just can’t help but burst out into tears.”"

For a balanced and respectful analysis of Dahmer I recommend the Last Podcast on the Left.  They did three episodes about Dahmer.   Dahmer Part I: Infinity Land Dahmer Part II: How To Be Left Alone In The Ghetto Dahmer Part III: Paint It White
serialkillers,2r0l8h,Naniface,16,Fri Jan 2 00:34:21 2015 UTC,I don't think they're balanced anymore. They've done so many serial killer profiles that it seems like they're starting to sympathize with the killers too much. A lot of what they say comes from the killers' own words/testimony/writing and they don't do a good job of taking that information with a grain of salt.

Most people that go down the road Dahmer went down get caught before they go to the extremes he did.  I won't dispute that what he did was disgusting and barbaric, but it doesn't change the fact that he didn't want to cause these people harm. His intention was to control them, which was also wrong."

serialkillers,2r0l8h,ImperviousSeahorse,21,Thu Jan 1 23:49:50 2015 UTC,"Your statements directly contradict the sworn testimony of his psychiatrists. Watch the video.   He had a sexual fetish for corpses and organs. He took living people and turned them into corpses, then mutilated them, simply for the purpose of masturbation.  Why are people so intent on defending this monster? It's so odd to me."
serialkillers,2r0l8h,ImperviousSeahorse,24,Thu Jan 1 17:20:21 2015 UTC,"I'm not defending him. I'm simply saying that he wasn't motivated in the same way that people like Bundy, Corll or Gacy were. He didn't enjoy seeing people suffer. He was incredibly selfish and craved control, that's where the necrophilia came from.   All his crimes derived from his twisted sense of loneliness. The cannibalism was an attempt to make the victim a part of him forever. I think Dahmer was a very disturbed individual. I find it hard to put him in the same category as Ted Bundy etc.  I've watched the trial video several times. I'm doing a psychology degree. Two years ago I wrote a 40 page report about Jeffrey Dahmer so I'm fairly knowledgeable about him. Psychology is subjective. There are several different theories about what caused Dahmer to do what he did, and none of them can be proven. It's a shame he's dead because we could have learnt a lot from his behaviours."
serialkillers,2r0l8h,illTwinkleYourStar,17,Thu Jan 1 17:32:52 2015 UTC,"I don't have a psychology degree, but I know serial killers (spoken to dozens over the past 6 years, profiled serial killer cold cases, and have done work with very reputable individuals in the field of profiling.)  Dahmer's crimes were not motivated by being lonely. They are motivated by sex. He wanted to control and keep his victims because ideally he wanted perfectly submissive sex slaves, not because he wanted companionship- he was quite settled into the loner role. He chose victim's whom he found attractive. He gave them crude lobotomies, then poured Drano in the wounds while they were still alive. This constitutes as torture, and Dahmer enjoyed this. He did not enjoy when they died, because this was not his objective, it was not part of his fantasy, and serial killers like Dahmer are motivated by fantasy. Having access to their bodies he sexually mutilated their corpses-- again for sexual gratification.   He kept their body parts and ate them as extreme trophies and souvenirs. He had plans of making furniture and other things with body parts, and eating his victim was an act of intimacy to him. Eating his victims didn't curb any sort of companionship issues or feelings of loneliness because he did it again and again.   In short Dahmer was a psychopathic, sexually motivated, torture killer.  Dahmer is a lot like Ted Bundy, John Gacy, etc. he just carried his crimes out differently and had different ideas of what he finds sexually exciting or gratifying. He was still motivated by sex, fantasy, and control/power."
serialkillers,2r0l8h,ImperviousSeahorse,-3,Fri Jan 2 12:37:52 2015 UTC,"torture killer.   Dahmer never tortured anyone. As other people have said in this thread, the killing was a means to an end. If he cut them up etc. when they were alive I'd agree with you.   Dahmer's crimes were not motivated by being lonely. They are motivated by sex. He wanted to control and keep his victims because ideally he wanted perfectly submissive sex slaves, not because he wanted companionship- he was quite settled into the loner role.   There are different theories about him, and ultimately your opinion and my opinion can't be verified. Dahmer and his psychiatrists often said that he killed his first victim because he didn't want him to leave. He did enjoy the companionship.   He had plans of making furniture and other things with body parts, and eating his victim was an act of intimacy to him.    He himself said he did it to make them a part of himself forever, and Dahmer is quit credible. No one forced him to divulge the extremely detailed information he did. The bones and remains he kept in boxes were definitely trophies though, and he did have plans to build some kind of altar out of them."

You are right the killings were a means to an end.. To the torture! What else would they be a means to an end? Dahmer is not a sadist, he didn't gain pleasure from his victims suffering. That's not to say he didn't enjoy what he was doing to them drawing on his fantasies.  And his crimes being motivated by sex can't be proven?.. Seriously?... I think I laid it out pretty clearly. That's not opinion, those are his actions. Companionship and sex are two different things, now look at his actions and ask yourself which is the stronger motivation."
serialkillers,2r0l8h,ImperviousSeahorse,1 point,Fri Jan 2 17:33:13 2015 UTC,"It would be torture if he did it to deliberately cause pain. With Dahmer this was not the case. He hurt people, sure, but he didn't hurt them for his own sexual gratification, he did it because he was trying to create a zombie.   Bundy used to torture women and literally place his mouth over his victim's so he could breathe her last last breath. Corll used to strap boys to a wooden plank so he could torture them. This is taking enjoyment in another person's suffering.   Please don't think I'm defending Dahmer. He was a maniac. I'm simply saying that he didn't enjoy the process of hurting someone."
serialkillers,2r0l8h,ImperviousSeahorse,3,Fri Jan 2 17:58:04 2015 UTC,pleasure in hurting someone is sadisim. He was not a sadist. Torture is the unnecessary infliction of pain on a victim regardless of the person inflicting the torture gains anything from it or not. Those victims had unnecessary pain inflicted on them. They were tortured.
serialkillers,2r0l8h,camouflage365,-2,Fri Jan 2 18:08:09 2015 UTC,"Torture is the unnecessary infliction of pain on a victim regardless of the person inflicting the torture gains anything from it or not.   In Dahmer's twisted mind it was necessary. His goal was to create an object with no will that he could do whatever he wanted with. Dahmer had nothing to gain from torturing his victims.  He strangled most of his victims, and that's brutal, but it's not torture. Torture is prolonging someone's pain for a purpose. Dahmer didn't enjoy inflicting pain on others, so he had no purpose. He killed and defiled bodies, but he wasn't a torturer."
serialkillers,2r0l8h,ImperviousSeahorse,3,Fri Jan 2 18:14:14 2015 UTC,"In Dahmer's twisted mind it was necessary.    Correct, this is what we refer to as a signature.   His goal was to create an object with no will that he could do whatever he wanted with.   Which I agree with and have previously stated. Again it was an act of control and power and he wanted to use these people for sexual purposes, he himself has stated this. He didn't want zombies to sit there for him to talk at, they were for sex. He is a sexually motivated killer. His first kill was even a play on his early sexual fantasies where he wanted to club a jogger and have his way with him (sex, control, and violence acting together). He picked up a hitchhiker he found attractive (there is the sexual aspect) instead and beat him to death when he wanted to leave (violence and control) Same with his second murder, it was impulsive and sexually motivated, he found the victim attractive, doesn't remember the murder but I imagine again it was a violent imposition of control. At that point the criminal progression had fully arrived.    Dahmer had nothing to gain from torturing his victims.   not from the torture itself, no. An amateur lobotomy and having harsh chemicals poured in the wound is torture, rather the offender got a thrill from the act itself or the result of the act. Dahmer craved the results of the procedure, trying to achieve his fantasy. That is what he gained pleasure in. Again, this is quite clear.    Torture is prolonging someone's pain for a purpose   the verb torture simply is to inflict pain upon another. Also it did have a purpose, to obtain his fantasy person. You are correct he didn't intentionally prolong suffering, but the other side of that is to say he alleviated his victims suffering and that just isn't true. His victims were suffering, and he caused it, that is why he killed them."

In any case, one doesn't need a degree to have a different opinion.  I agree with the other guy. Dahmer was not interested in pain, as say, BTK was. Killing his victims was a means to an end for him, so he could have his way with them. I think he was also kind of turned on by corpses, but again, not the process of killing them. That's why he did those bizarre experiments to try to keep them alive.   I'm not sure why you interpret this opinion as defending Dahmer. No one here is doing that at all.

Sure, Dahmer was all about the necrophilia and did some horrible things as a means to that sexually driven end, but I think the point that people are trying to make is that for him it wasn't about his victims suffering.  It was about making them corpses.  Compare that to someone like David Parker Ray and the differences are pretty difficult to miss."

(This was a joke guys.)  I'm not speculating at all. His actions say it all. He drugged his victims so they'd be unconscious when he killed them. He always killed them quickly, he didn't prolong their suffering. He even tried to keep some of them alive as 'zombie' sex slaves so he wouldn't need to kill again.   He sought out living people he thought would make attractive corpses to have sex with   That's just not true. He sought attractive people because they were attractive. Necrophilia isn't necessarily an attraction to corpses, people who have a desire to completely control a person's body are also technically necrophiliacs. He tried to keep some of his victims alive, why would he do that if he was only turned on by corpses?   but first he sliced open their bellies because looking at exposed organs during sex turned him on.   The victim was always dead when Dahmer did this, and the dissection can once again be linked to his pathological loneliness. He wanted to know everything and control everything about that person."

You're insulting yourself there, because you're clearly interested in the subject too. You wouldn't be here otherwise.   Both clinicians (for the defense, as well as the prosecution) testified on the video that you have not seen that Dahmer admitted to having a sexual attraction to corpses.   I have seen the video several times, and as I said before, necrophilia isn't necessarily an attraction to dead bodies. It is, in most cases, a dangerously powerful attraction to completely dominating a person. If you did a psych degree you'd understand that.   He was so broken up and ashamed of what he did to the hitchhiker Steven Hicks, that he brought the severed head upstairs one week after dismembering him to stare at it as he masturbated.   This isn't correct. Dahmer masturbated over Hicks' body immediately after strangling him with a dumbbell. He buried the entire body in his back yard the morning after he killed him. A few months later he dug him up and put his remains in acid."

serialkillers,2qy6kz,badrussiandriver,2,Thu Jan 1 01:56:00 2015 UTC,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violent_Criminal_Apprehension_Program  It is designed to track and correlate information on violent crime, especially murder. The FBI provides the software for the database which is widely used by state and local law enforcement agencies to compile information on:  solved and unsolved homicides, especially those involving a kidnapping or if they are apparently motiveless, sexual or random or suspected to be part of a series missing persons, where foul play is suspected unidentified persons, where foul play is suspected sexual assault cases"
serialkillers,2qy6kz,kamorra2,2,Thu Jan 1 01:56:29 2015 UTC,"Violent Criminal Apprehension Program:       The Violent Criminal Apprehension Program (ViCAP) is a unit of the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation responsible for the analysis of serial violent and sexual crimes, organizationally situated within the Critical Incident Response Group's (CIRG) National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime (NCAVC).  ViCAP was created in 1985 by the FBI out of Quantico, Virginia. Pierce Brooks was appointed as the first director, primarily because as a homicide detective in Los Angeles he had been the first to propose the idea. Brooks was inspired by the Harvey Glatman case he had worked on in which he realized serial homicides could be linked by their signature aspects. Brooks would later obtain a $35,000 government grant in an attempt to realize his idea. In 1982, he met with Robert Ressler to discuss the idea and was convinced by Ressler that VICAP should be located at Quantico as opposed to Lakewood where Brooks originally planned to have it housed.  It is designed to track and correlate information on violent crime, especially murder. The FBI provides the software for the database which is widely used by state and local law enforcement agencies to compile information on:   solved and unsolved homicides, especially those involving a kidnapping or if they are apparently motiveless, sexual or random or suspected to be part of a series missing persons, where foul play is suspected unidentified persons, where foul play is suspected sexual assault cases   Cases fitting these categories can be entered into the system by law enforcement officials and compared to other cases in an attempt to correlate and match possible connections. Vi-CAP has been a tool in solving many cases, including cases decades old and cases in widely separated states. ViCAP is particularly valuable in identifying and tracking serial killers, where separate victims might not otherwise be connected as part of the same pattern. [citation needed]  The aforementioned pattern that links serial homicides is what is commonly referred to as ""signature"". VICAP operates under the knowledge that serial homicides are almost always sexually and control driven with a consistent evolving signature present in each murder. [citation needed]  In the summer of 2008, the ViCAP program made its database available to all law enforcement agencies through a secure internet link. This allows for real time access to the database and allows agencies to enter and update cases directly into the database.

serialkillers,2qoi3r,00976,7,Mon Dec 29 04:17:32 2014 UTC,I think the police finally picked up on the number of boys disappearing after he'd 'hired' them to do construction work for him around the house etc. From what I gather from documentaries they didn't suspect serious foul play until they looked around the house and smelt the decomposition.
serialkillers,2qoi3r,CallMeCrow,3,Mon Dec 29 10:46:40 2014 UTC,"The decomp smell was smelled the first time they went in the house but they didn't connect the dots until they were pretty heavy on his trail. One of the detectives had experience in a morgue so he was familiar with the smell, but couldn't quite put his finger on what it was so he just made a mental note of it.  What truly did him in was a mix of the first part of your post as well as what people they interviewed said about Gacy. Sexual assault was rampant In the stories so they decided to take a look Into his rap sheet. Sure enough there was some kind of Sodomy charge, something Gacy didn't exactly ""hide"" as he was telling people the charge came from him showing minors pornographic films, when in reality he picked up some kid (the detectives actually found and interviewed the guy) and drugged and raped him. Guy woke up somewhere alone wherever Gacy left him and ran to the police. I forget why nothing more than Sodomy charges came of it but I believe it was pretty much laziness from the PD.   The kids that worked for him had also been advanced on sexually  on many occasions by Gacy, one of his favorite ""come ons"" was while they were playing pool, he would say ""let's make a bet, whoever wins can get 10 dollars (I believe it was a little more) or a blowjob."" Almost every one of his employees had that to say of Gacy.  The whole time the case in being investigated, they are pretty much with Gacy 24/7. On multiple occasions they would tail him (at 100+mph) to a bar/restaurant where they would Eat and have drinks together and either one of the deceives or Gacy himself would cover the whole bill. Amazing story."
serialkillers,2qoi3r,CallMeCrow,6,Mon Dec 29 14:04:53 2014 UTC,"You're right the story amazes me too. One of his tricks was using magic handcuffs to see if his victim could get out of them, but then he'd swap them for real ones and they were trapped. His interviews are interesting and I don't think he ever fully admits to the dark stuff, most of them blame it on their 'bad side'. Interesting that Robert Ressler (FBI Criminal Profiler) worked on the case and he actually grew up on the same street as Gacy. There's good documentaries on YouTube which tell the story from his perspective.   Robert Ressler - [Part 2] - Criminal Profiler - D…: http://youtu.be/y4gcq7IJplQ  This touches on his view of the case, it's in 5 or so parts."
serialkillers,2qoi3r,CallMeCrow,5,Mon Dec 29 14:13:36 2014 UTC,"Totally. I believe he was shooting for an insanity defense. He even made up a second personality,  name and all. He spawned the name from some officer/detective he met previously, and just added a different first name."
serialkillers,2qoi3r,DoomBox,7,Mon Dec 29 14:17:17 2014 UTC,"It is too bad that at first, the police did nothing to help the guy who got away from Gacy. I think they didn't bother finding out who Gacy was, so this guy sat on the edge of the highway for days until he saw Gacy's car drive by and he recorded the license plate. Even after they went to court about it, Gacy threatened to press charges against him or something so in the end I think he got away with a mere assault charge or something really minor compared to what he actually did. When Gacy's murders was discovered, the police actually wanted to talk to the guy for once. I think they didn't want to talk to him in the first place because they thought he was gay or something.  About the employee thing, I remember reading in a book about a guy who stayed at Gacy's house. One night, Gacy was drunk or something and had come back from a charity event, where he was dressed as a clown. And he told this employee about these handcuff tricks he did. So the guy tried it, got stuck of course, and then Gacy spun him around saying ""I'm going to rape you"". Luckily the employee had been in the army before so he kicked Gacy in the face and got him to get out of the handcuffs. Otherwise he probably would've been killed. Another time Gacy came into the guy's room in the middle of the night and said ""You really don't know who I am.. Maybe it's best if you gave me what I want."" I don't know but that always freaked me out, I'd be scared if I was the guy at that moment. He moved out the next day I think.  The whole time Gacy believed he could manipulate the police by buying them drinks and driving recklessly, even taunting them by saying ""a clown can get away with murder.."" I think the police knew they were onto something by the time they were out on surveillance. Indeed it is amazing, the whole lead up before his arrest."

serialkillers,2qoi3r,OriginalUncleFlyBaby,3,Mon Dec 29 20:29:06 2014 UTC,"Jeff rignall's case was going through court while JWG was arrested. The Piest Reciept was the definitive piece that put the boy in the house, so I'd say it was what did him in. The CPD were defintely aware of Gacy, people in the gay community knew something was going on, and so did the CPD in some of the districts on the north side. The case was just investigated pretty shotty, which is why two ""dead"" people have been found alive, and DNA on victims' graves aren't matching their parents DNA. It's a shame everything was removed from johnwaynegacynews.com. There was some wild stuff being posted there, getting really specific about how the investigation was fucked up, and why it was intentionally fucked up."
serialkillers,2qoi3r,DoomBox,2,Wed Dec 31 03:42:51 2014 UTC,"I agree, I'd say it was the receipt that really caught up with him in the end. The whole investigation was done poorly, like you said. I think the woman who has the remains of someone else, that someone else is likely the boy her son was with at the time he went missing and they got the identification mismatched. The bodies were buried so close together, that they would just randomly match bones at times and maybe that's what led to the misidentification. The police said they just got too many missing persons cases a year to really do anything, but I always thought it was odd that when the kid of a police officer went missing, alarms didn't go off.. Shouldn't the guy have given a piece of his mind to the department? Maybe it would've helped some. Alongside the car Gacy stole from a victim and the fact that some of the victims worked for him. I think they were really incompetent at the time and didn't want to deal with some of the cases that had homosexual overtones to them, due to the stigma at the time.   I think I talked to the main reporter who ran the site once, I was asking her about something and instead she began asking me questions.. She was really interested in one of Gacy's victims, a guy who was in college. It struck me as odd and she never replied after some messaging. It always made me wonder why it was removed."

serialkillers,2ql0yb,tafkat,7,Sun Dec 28 23:29:19 2014 UTC,"I could find a case study that included a brief description but not much more.   During the subsequent investigation, search warrants were executed on the cab of the semi-tractor truck and on Robert Ben Rhoades' residence in Houston, Texas. The results of the searches revealed a briefcase containing whips, handcuffs, spring-type clips, a dildo, various items of women's clothing, miscellaneous paperwork, and several photographs of a young white female in various poses, both nude and partially dressed.  There were Polaroid photographs of several women inside ""open-roofed"" vehicles, apparently taken from inside the trucker's cab as the women passed him on the highway. These photographs were seized from Rhoades' Houston apartment. There were also photographs of one particular victim (a teenage girl) in the sleeper berth of the trucker's cab, in the outdoors, and in an abandoned barn-type structure. In this particular set of photographs, the victim was handcuffed, chained, and posing with a dildo and had the spring-type clips attached to her nipples.  The teenager in the photographs remained unidentified as far as the Robert Ben Rhoades case was concerned. Then, on September 29, 1990, the decomposed body of a young female was found in an abandoned barn near Greenville, Illinois. The cause of death was determined to be ligature strangulation. The victim was later identified as 14-year-old Regina Walters. Walters was reported as a runaway from Pasadena, Texas, nearly 8 months before her remains were discovered. At the time of the initial missing persons report, Walters had been in the company of an 18-year-old white male named Ricky Lee Jones. The two were reportedly hitchhiking to New Mexico. Ricky Lee Jones has not been located as of this writing.  http://www.articlesbase.com/law-articles/case-study-murderone-jurisdiction-at-a-time-the-case-of-robert-ben-rhoades-380655.html"

Freedom of information is a law based more on federal Agency transparency.   All unsealed Henley trial transcripts are public record and should be available to you as long as they still exist. All you have to do is ask and pay for the hard copies of the documents, but you are willing to pay anyways, so you're set.  I have obtained information this way for years. It's not as challenging as one would think. Good luck!"

Friends also said Rohner had told officials at River Valley Services, a state-run voluntary respite program for adults, that her son was not taking his psychiatric medications and had asked that he be hospitalized.

Very, very good.  I've been the most fascinated with the Zodiac Killer and Graysmith is so obsessive and detailed about the investigation. Helter Skelter by Robert Bugliosi about Charles Manson.  Definitely interesting, but a long one.  The story focuses way more on the court side of things and how the prosecution could prove Manson was responsible for murders, even if he didn't commit them. The Most Dangerous Animal of All by Gary Stewart about the Zodiac Killer.  This is a recent release and had a big media blitz around it.  The author believes his father was the Zodiac Killer.  Frankly, I don't think he's right.  The story is actually pretty interesting to read anyways. Devil in the White City by Eric Larson about H.H. Holmes.  The story is split between focusing on H.H. Holmes and the Colombian Exposition (World's Fair) in Chicago.  The Chicago thing is actually more interesting.  The Holmes stuff is impressive, but there's been so much time that it's hard to really piece together his crimes accurately. The Stranger Beside Me by Ann Rule about Ted Bundy.  A very different perspective on serial killers, because the author knew Bundy and signed a deal to write a book about the murders he committed before he was even a suspect.  So it's pretty sympathetic to the killer.  But...it comes off a little contrived.  Ann Rule has been accused of twisting details to make a more compelling store and I got that feeling while reading listening to this.

This is really the key fact regarding her case.  I always thought it was odd that Shannan wasn't grouped with other LISK victims, simply due to the circumstances surrounding her final moments.  She was running for her life, banging on doors and moving to the next simply because she had no time to stop and wait at all.  The fact that she may have died accidentally while fleeing doesn't discount that someone was very likely trying to kill her.    The bigger question is if we can say with any kind of certainty that she was being chased by the LISK.  She was an internet prostitute, attacked in Long Island by a man who was never identified.  It's important, because if Gilbert escaped from someone's house and tried to run and that person was the LISK, he lives somewhere in that Oak Beach neighbourhood."

serialkillers,2onxge,MindAlteringSitch,5,Mon Dec 8 17:46:48 2014 UTC,"For context - Known as the Nightstalker, Richard Ramirez was into all the classic serial killer stuff - Satanism, messages written in blood, toying with the police, corpse mutilation etc.  He famously attended a town hall meeting about him, and targeted (killed) an outspoken resident who 'dared the nightstalker to come into his house at night' Forced his victims to swear to Satan and drew pentagrams on victims and walls, as well as threatening to 'cut their eyes out' if they looked at him while he sodomized them. This was especially scary because he took a pair of eyes as one of his earliest trophies and it had been all over the news.  Double bonus I'm sorry for messing up the trivia fact - A teenager noticed a guy dressed in dark clothes walking around his house in the suburbs, and later decided to write down his description and license plate when the same man hopped into a car and drove off quickly. In between those moments the Nightstalker had shot a sleeping man, dragged his wife through their house with a necktie around her throat, and then told herto ""tell them the nightstalker was here.""  He went to visit a friend in Arizona, and even though the information from the teenager had made him front page news in California, he was virtually undetected that morning. By what we can only call luck or divine retribution, his friend wasn't in and Ramirez decided to head back to Los Angeles - probably to steal a new car and get back to Nightstalking. here's where it get's awesome  While browsing a convenience store, Ramirez heard two ladies calling him 'el Matador' and then noticed his face on the front page news. He immediately fled the scene as the ladies called 911, and ran out onto the freeway to steal a car GTA V style by just pulling the driver out the door when she slammed on her brakes.  But unlike video game AI, Angelinos are not only fearless but slightly insane when it comes to bullshit on the freeway. So instead of making another daring escape, The Nightstalker was viciously beaten by a crowed of people getting out of their cars and running from the cross streets. When the police arrived he had injuries from blunt objects and 'a metal pipe' and I'm certain there's about 300 people who probably claim to this day that they captured the nightstalker.   But after all that he got married in prison and then died of natural causes....#morbid"

His highly publicized home invasion crime spree terrorized the residents of the greater Los Angeles area, and later the residents of the San Francisco area, from June 1984 until August 1985. Prior to his capture, Ramirez was dubbed the ""Night Stalker"" by the news media. He used a wide variety of weapons, including handguns, knives, a machete, a tire iron, and a hammer. Ramirez, who was an avowed Satanist, never expressed any remorse for his crimes. The judge who upheld his thirteen death sentences remarked that Ramirez's deeds exhibited ""cruelty, callousness, and viciousness beyond any human understanding"".  Ramirez died of complications from B-cell lymphoma while awaiting execution on California's death row.

serialkillers,2ogtr4,camouflage365,6,Sun Dec 7 14:07:16 2014 UTC,"Arguably the only person who could be worse than someone like Dean Corll is the person who fed him victims for gain.   I really don't think that point can be argued at all.  Brooks was a TWELVE year old boy when he started hanging out with Dean, and Dean groomed him to become his accomplice. A twelve year old boy with a troubled background.  They say that psychopaths can be very deceptive, and are incredibly manipulative. Charles Manson convinced a group of grown adults that he was some sort of prophet or god or something, and that they had to kill for him. Dean had all the neighbourhood kids hanging out with him; he was a father figure to many of them. I think Brooks was doomed the day he met ""the candyman""."
serialkillers,2ogtr4,dethb0y,0,Mon Dec 8 09:50:07 2014 UTC,"There's making a mistake, and then there's being complicit in numerous murders. This isn't a kid who got lost and started dealing drugs, or a kid who got confused and held up a liqour store; brooks brought numerous innocent people to Corrl, knowing they'd be killed (and horrifically, at that).   Brooks could have put a stop to it at any point. That he only did after his own life was threatened speaks volumes as to what his priorities were.   At some point, people are responsible for their own actions. Certainly Brooks was responsible for his actions (and i don't believe he's ever even said he was not)."
serialkillers,2ogtr4,camouflage365,9,Mon Dec 8 10:05:35 2014 UTC,"But Brooks didn't make a ""mistake"", and I never worded it that way.  I think you're only looking at this only through your eyes; in a very black and white way.  I believe Brooks' mind was corrupted by Corrl, which resulted in a very damaged personality. It's the same reason most serial killers were abused as children.  Maybe your reality growing up was having a loving family, friends, and the thought of a long and happy future. Dean Corll was Brooks' reality."

serialkillers,2ogtr4,Steinrik,5,Sun Dec 7 22:52:49 2014 UTC,"Here in Norway the maximum normal sentence is 21 years. One could be sentenced to longer sentences to protect society, but these would be open for review with regular intervals. With people like Anders Behring Breivik (the Norwegian terrorist that killed 77 people, including many children and teenagers) that show no signs of repentance or regret, this can very well be a real life sentence. If the criminal is found to have been rehabilitated during his incarceration, he might be freed although in a very supervised manner. Several of the participants in one of Norways biggest robberies (with one police man killed) was released after less than ten years in prison. This I believe is an somewhat unexpected and largely unwanted result of some relatively resent changes in Norwegian criminal law. (This will be changed as soon at possible, as it has been heavily criticized.)  As I understand it, revenge is a rather large part of the US penal system. In Norway sentences are based almost exclusively on the severity of the crime. Revenge carries very little, if any weight at all when sentences are set. The son of the police man I mentioned above has met the man that killed his father, but has expressed no need or wish for revenge. Revenge has very little value in Norway."
serialkillers,2ogtr4,AdenintheGlaven,4,Mon Dec 8 03:19:57 2014 UTC,"I do like the Norwegian system and its focus on rehabilitation but some people need to stay in prison for the rest of their existence because of the danger they pose. Given the robbery example I can definitely understand the value in rehabilitating people and encouraging them to have the resources not to do the same crime again, but it shouldn't apply to scumbags like Breivik who have no remorse. If it helps you, I don't believe the death penalty should be used for moralistic and practical purposes as it epitomises the 'revenge' often seen in US law enforcement."
serialkillers,2ogtr4,MindAlteringSitch,3,Mon Dec 8 03:27:04 2014 UTC,"I know what you mean, but the american justice system has a very strong undertone of punishment. Even though we have rules against 'cruel and unusual punishment' the thought of something 'rotting in prison' is almost a punchline for TV shows and Movies.  When it comes to serial killers this collective opinion really comes out to shine, because psychopaths represent ""the worst of the worst"" the very definition of a sociopathic killer based on how differently they do and process things. So just like in the Ender's Game universe, when encounter a species you cannot possibly coexist with, the natural course of action is war.  So even though some of these prisoners committed their crimes when many readers were not yet a twinkle in their father's eyes, the abstract concept of justice has no lifespan and seeing its hand in the words 'still incarcerated' makes many people feel much better after trying to digest the horror of reading accounts of a serial murder."

serialkillers,2nu9tc,xxweednotwar,2,Tue Dec 2 21:47:32 2014 UTC,It's not genetic inheritance . Everyone can kill but due to their life experiences and the function of their brain-- or any abnormality or disease that may affect their brain-- it takes more or less for someone to exercise those capabilities. Personality disorders are a factor but you can't definitively call them genetic.  Francis Weaver may be slightly more desensitized than most when it comes to murder or violence due to his families history of murder. That doesn't account for other events or experiences that factor in-- such as his Father raping his girlfriend when he was 19. It doesn't shock me that he is involved with drugs and/or eventually committed or was involved in a violent act.   Genetics did not make a drug deal go bad resulting in a murder for Frances Weaver. Ward Sr. Kidnapped raped and killed a woman and buried her body under a deck in his yard. Ward Jr buried one of his victims under concrete in his back yard. That's not genetics-- that's what makes sense in Ward Jr's brain.

serialkillers,2nog7e,samanthahazard,21,Fri Nov 28 16:57:35 2014 UTC,He was one of the first serial killers I looked at and saw a human being with problems and not just some monster. I really felt sorry for him and his family. I still think if someone had had an intervention with him as a kid much of the evil he did would have never happened. It was a sad situation for everyone involved.
serialkillers,2nog7e,EnIdiot,19,Fri Nov 28 21:37:40 2014 UTC,"I actually feel the opposite. I read a book on him and all things considered, he came from a pretty normal background. He wasn't abused or severely bullied or witness to cruelty like many serial killers. What brought out this behavior in him is a mystery to me."
serialkillers,2nog7e,poop_dawg,8,Fri Nov 28 22:07:53 2014 UTC,I agree but that's exactly why for a while I was fascinated with him. Just kept on researching trying to work out how his behaviour shifted so much with his upbringing... absolute mystery.
serialkillers,2nog7e,Bel7861,7,Fri Nov 28 23:42:32 2014 UTC,"Actually for me it was Jack the Ripper. I took a college Jan-term course on him back in 1988 (the centential). At the time  I was convinced that he was a conspiracy of Masons or some nonsense. I later studied psychology some and found that the problem of evil isn't that we have monsters among us, but that we have people among us who do monstrous things. Dahmer did come from a relatively good family background, and that is what is fascinating about him. I think sociopathy and alcoholism are genetic, but the degree of extreme behavior he showed was learned. Possibly a better way to put it is that he never learned why such behavior is wrong. These guys are like color-blind individuals in that they just aren't able to see what we see the way we see it. They are morally-blind."
serialkillers,2nog7e,EnIdiot,6,Fri Nov 28 22:20:57 2014 UTC,"I don't know if that's accurate. I learned why such behavior is wrong, but there's just nothing behind it. There's no conviction, there's just something in my head that's broken and doesn't apply this braking mechanism that most people seem to naturally have when they're doing something considered morally wrong. I don't know. It's difficult to explain. There's a difference between intellectually knowing something is wrong and being compelled by your own internal morality to comply with that knowledge. I don't have that internal morality. If psychopaths genuinely didn't understand right and wrong, they would all get off with an insanity defense.  Edit: Words."
serialkillers,2nog7e,Psychopath-,3,Fri Nov 28 23:58:46 2014 UTC,"First off, I'm sorry that you suffer from this condition. Lacking the ability to empathize with others is like not having the ability to smell good smells, or seeing rich colors, or tasting good things. A reason is not an excuse. There may be a reason a sociopath (the correct term IIRC) kills someone, there is never an excuse.   However, I've met plenty of sociopaths who were able to contribute to society and good things (almost 25 % of the entrepreneurs I've worked for had sociopathic tendencies). You don't have to have an emotional depth of feeling to play chess, you just have to know the rules. I don't really care that you don't kill people because of the great moral tragedy it would cause, but I am glad you know the rules and have the fear for your own freedom and keep from killing people.  Finally, my hope is that we have a treatment for this lack of empathy one day and that the condition is looked upon like ADHD. In the meantime, enforce those boundaries in your behavior and remember that you can do something good by NOT doing something evil."
serialkillers,2nog7e,EnIdiot,2,Sun Nov 30 14:50:38 2014 UTC,"For me, it was Bundy. Read about hin in a high school psych class on the section discussing violence. Then, thanks to living in Colorado, one of my best friend's mother's friends actually was one of his victims here so the fascination grew.  Then I had the opportunity to urbex the remains of his house in Salt Lake City. So Bundy started it all for me and in still learning about Dahmer."

serialkillers,2nfx1p,abanks47,3,Wed Nov 26 08:35:22 2014 UTC,"Sorry!! I was juggling pets, kids & dinner & forgot to finish my post.  Derek Percy was pretty much locked up & forgotten by most of Australia after he was locked up for Yvonne Tuohy's murder. Meanwhile life went on & the mystery of all those unsolved child murders across Australia grew over subsequent decades.  There were the 3 missing Beaumont siblings in Adelaide & then 881 miles away, Christine Sharrock & best friend Marianne Schmidt, victims of the Wanda Beach murders & 3 yr old Simon Brook in inner city Glebe, their cases were on opposite sides of Sydney. Linda Stillwell disappeared over 550 miles from the Sydney murders & 457 miles from the place the Beaumont kids disappeared & 6 yr old Allen Redstone was murdered near Canberra, 178 miles from Sydney, 748 miles from the Beaumont kids disappearance, over 416 miles from the place Linda Stilwell disappeared & Yvonne Tuohy was murdered.   There were rumours that police & prison officers strongly suspected they knew who was responsible, but for years & years none would talk publicly or name names. In general discussions, most people outside law enforcement discounted a single perpetrator killing children in seperate states, & even the cases within single states, due to the vast distances involved - besides, no-one had even heard of serial killers when these kids were murdered.  My dad worked in a law enforcement-related field so I was privy to conversations & details that most weren't & I learned the names that had been linked to these kids but forgotten by most of the public as the media interest of the 1960's faded. ""Percy"" was one of the names, ""Von Einem"" was the other. I remember asking dad which one he thought it was & why. I was a teenager at the time, by this stage he knew I'd been sneaking in & reading his Australian Police Journal & forensic books since I was 7 or 8 & he would occasionally share a book or article with me, but this time it was different. He said Von Einem's criminal history & proximity to the Adelaide cases made him a possiblity for the Beaumonts, but there were things about Percy, disgusting & very unusual things & a bunch of stories that came out after he was jailed, that made him a very strong suspect.  ""What kind of things?"" I asked (of course). My dad told me that he knew I could handle what I read of his collection, but there were some things so unspeakable that no-one should ever have to know about them & he wasn't about to share something like that with me. He was so serious & reasonable about it that I didn't even think of arguing, but my interest was piqued & any time Percy's name came up in the media I took notice.  When I realised someone had written an in-depth book on Percy I hoped I'd have some insight into my dad's distress & difficulty discussing him with my teenage self two decades earlier - I really got my questions answered. I've read a lot of true crime & law enforcement articles, but I've never read of anything remotely like the horror story that was Derek Percy (he died of cancer earlier this year & refused to relieve the suffering of the devastated families he left behind)  There was one last victim too. Shane Spiller was the little boy with Yvonne the day she was murdered. Percy's fantasies involved killing multiple children. He tried to take Shane too, but Shane had a small tomahawk with him & was able to fight him off & raise the alarm. If not for Shane, Percy would never have been caught so early & there's no question that more children would have died. Shane's story from that day forward is heartbreaking. He is currently on the NSW Police Missing Persons Database.  This article about him is very long, but well worth the read  http://www.theage.com.au/news/in-depth/what-happened-to-shane-spiller/2007/06/16/1181414609007.html  Edited : clarified some statements & added more victims names/places  2nd edit : corrected facts - Derek Percy has never been convicted of any crime. He was found not guilty by reason of insanity - criminally insane I guess, & held in the Victorian prison system on those grounds (because at that time it was beyond comprehension anyone could do what he did & not be insane). Dad said he wasn't insane at all & described him as ""as cunning as a shithouse rat""."

Born in Brantford, Ontario, Hartman and his family moved to the United States when he was 10. After graduating from California State University, Northridge, with a degree in graphic arts, he designed album covers for bands like Poco and America. Feeling the need for a more creative outlet, Hartman joined the comedy group The Groundlings in 1975 and there helped comedian Paul Reubens develop his character Pee-wee Herman. Hartman co-wrote the screenplay for the film Pee-wee's Big Adventure and made recurring appearances on Reubens' show Pee-wee's Playhouse.

Most of the well known serial killers were in major cities Gacy (Chicago). Ramirez(LA), hillside stranglers (LA), Joel Rifkin (Long Island/NYC), Dahmer (Milwaukee)etc. also media has changed, where it used to be print and TV, now there is the internet. You used to be spoon fed your info because of your limited sources of media. now you have a much broader choice of media so serial killer coverage may slip by you.   So why more killers are known than others, location and broader media has some to do with it."

serialkillers,2mm1y0,MILK_DUD_NIPPLES,2,Tue Nov 18 12:03:14 2014 UTC,"My personal feeling (being a big-city liberal) is that prisoners should have any rights that aren't considered a security risk. I'm of the opinion that prison should be more for rehabilitation than for punishment. So unless a marriage is a detriment to the security of the prisoner or to the prison, and as long as the prisoner is in good standing (no disciplinary violations, not in SHU/seg etc.) then why not? Keeping them chained up like animals and then shoving them out the door when their sentence is complete isn't a recipe for success. Not letting lifers marry just seems like an arbitrary punishment. If it's not a security risk, then I don't see the problem. If they're allowed a little humanity than they'll probably be less likely to cause problems. I did a Google search and didn't find much, but it looks like the policies are applied equally to all prisoners, with the exception of death row prisoners and those with sentences shorter than a year. Some states don't allow them to get married. But other than that there doesn't seem to be a distinction made for sentence length or original offense."

serialkillers,2mm1y0,Annajbanana,3,Tue Nov 18 12:54:29 2014 UTC,"Hmm... I think that being confined is punishment. And I'm not saying that prisons should be college dorm rooms. When I say that prisoners should have any rights that don't compromise security, I don't think the doors should be unlocked and they should be hanging out eating pizza and drinking beer. By the time you take away all the rights that don't compromise security there's not going to be lot of room left for comforts. The primary goal should be rehabilitation within an environment of discipline and safety and security. I don't think that making prison harsh just for the sake of making it terrible is very constructive. A lot of these guys are going to get out someday and we're going to have to deal with them then. And I'm just some guy on his sofa that's curious about prisons, so take my opinions as just opinion. There's a reason I'm not setting policy."

It would give them a sense of responsibility and reward so they have a reason to act right. It would teach how to work within a structure and show them that their actions have consequences. Yes, it sounds a lot like treating them like children, and maybe it is, but I think a big reason that a lot of men are in prison (I really don't know about women in prison but a lot of it seems to have to do with getting involved with the wrong men) has to do with not being taught how to act as kids. Teach them to be adults and maybe they'll act like adults. Teach them a skill and give them an education maybe they won't have to turn to crime to make money or feel some self-esteem."

Traveled all around the U.S. between 2002 and 2012, killing people hundreds of miles apart.  Would plant kill kits around the country, and revisit them later to commit his random murders.  He also traveled overseas quite a bit, we have no idea what he might have done elsewhere.  A pattern wasn't even close-to established before his arrest, he alluded to upwards of 12 victims but we can never know for sure.  There's also the West Mesa killer.  Eleven skeletal prostitues were discovered in the desert, case unsolved.  Though the best suspect died the same year the murders stopped; shot to death by the boyfriend of the strangled prostitute he was putting in his trunk.  In Brazil, Tiago Henrique Gomes da Rocha confessed to 39 murders recently.  The same week, Daniela Poggiali was found to have killed 38 patients on post as a nurse.  I don't know how far back we're going here, so I'll just keep it in the 2000s.  Charlie Brandt killed himself in 2004, along with his wife and niece.  The manner in which he killed his niece gave investigators the feeling that he had done something like this before.  The next day, his sister came forward with information that Charlie had killed their mother and shot their father when he was thirteen (she was fifteen).  He was put under psychiatric care for a year, and released.  Between his 1973 release and his 2004 death, there have been a number of murders linked to Charlie involving decapitation and heart removal, among other mutilations.  Nobody knows how many he killed, he went unchecked for 31 years.   Lonnie Franklin was arrested in 2010 as the Grim Sleeper, an LA serial killer who had taken a 16 year gap in between his killings.  Anthony Sowell killed 11 prostitutes and kept them in his home.  He was arrested in 2009.  In Russa, there's a couple of people shooting and killing motorists.  Currently not apprehended."

Two women were found brutally murdered and dumped in different locations just off the highway in Wyoming early 1992, they have never been identified. ""Bitter Creek Betty"" (warning: ""cleaned up"" postmortem photo at link) was found in Sweetwater County and the other girl was found in Sheridan County. Investigators have long suspected the cases were related and the work of a serial offender (cause of death for Bitter Creek Betty was an ice pick or similar object into her skull, in addition to other trauma... so sad...) but they only recently officially linked the two cases with DNA.   These cases really bother me because they seem so solvable... they have the killer's DNA, Bitter Creek Betty has distinctive scars and a tattoo and they even tracked down the shop and artist, but the victims still don't even have their names after all these years. The Sheridan Jane Doe was only 16-21 years old, and Bitter Creek Betty was wearing a wedding ring and probably had a kid (c-section scar.)"

Angela Brosso was raped, mutilated, and decapitated. Her head was found in a canal 11 days later, it was believed to have been kept frozen for some amount of time. Melanie Bernas was also raped and multilated in a similar fashion though exact information on how was never released. Bernas was only 17 at the time and found wearing a swimsuit that did not belong to her. Both cases were linked by DNA but no one has been charged in either case. These two bother me since I really doubt the killer just appeared committed two horrific murders and stopped.

serialkillers,2mker8,Psychopath-,3,Wed Nov 19 21:52:40 2014 UTC,"I can understand where people are coming from there, but I think their methodology fits in with serial killers.  More importantly, I think the spree killer classification is fatally (har har) flawed because nobody knows what does and doesn't count as a cooling off period.  But the bigger deal for me is that, ultimately, these classifications are supposed to point to a shared pathology, or at least a related cluster of pathologies.  The spree killer doesn't seem to do that, or at least it's very easy for people who better fit the mass murderer or serial killer classes to fall into it.  Ridgeway did multiple, discrete murders within a 24 hour period more than once, but he obviously belongs in the same class as Berkowitz, Rader, Zodiac, and all the others with a tradition cooling off period.  So does Bundy, even though his behavior in Florida is a mass murder - or was it a really compressed spree?  On the other end of the spectrum, it's weird to me that Seung-Hui Cho and Charles Whitman are one classification, but Adam Lanza, James Holmes, and Klebold and Harris are another.  Granted, I don't know a lot about spree killers or mass murderers, so there might be more to that difference that I'm aware of.  That said, I get the impression that criminologists and law enforcement are downplaying the 'cooling off period' concept these days.  EDIT: Oh, and while I'm on the subject, the Eastbound Strangler I mentioned above would probably fit with whatever your decide the DC Snipers are: all the victims were within a two-month period."

The crimes, which became known as the Houston Mass Murders, came to light only after Henley fatally shot Corll.  Corll was also known as the Candy Man and the Pied Piper, because he and his family had owned and operated a candy factory in Houston Heights, and he had been known to give free candy to local children.   At the time of their discovery, the Houston Mass Murders were considered the worst example of serial murder in American history.

S.) and Corll's possible habit of disposing of them after some time, then ""upgrading"" them with new ones...  And then there is the uneasy possibility that Brooks and Henley may have begun using their experience gained with Corll to go on private hunts of their own, except targeting those they themselves preferred - young girls - for their own pleasure. Marjorie B.'s unsolved murder would not be out of the realm of possibility as one such event. There were persistent rumors that she was seen with Brooks on the night of her death."

Their throats were cut and their bodies horribly mutilated. He was never caught and his identity remains one of the worldʼs greatest crime mysteries. In the years that have passed since Jack the Ripperʼs killing spree, many high-profile suspects have been suggested, yet the fact remains that none of them can be placed at any of the crime scenes.  Now, journalist Christer Holmgren believes that he has found a suspect who can not only be linked directly to one of the murders but also whose daily routine could be consistent with all the other deaths.  Holmgren has been studying the case for more than three decades in the belief that somewhere in the mass of records, some overlooked detail would point to the killer. His focus eventually fell on the seemingly trivial confusion that surrounded the testimony of a witness called Charles Cross.  Cross is credited with finding the body of the Ripperʼs second victim, Polly Nichols. Yet when Holmgren looked further into the details, it emerged that not only did Charles Cross lie to a policeman on the night but also that he lied at the inquest and even gave a false name. For years the pseudonym ʻCrossʼ chose to give the police shielded him. Only recently have modern researchers discovered his real identity. Once Christer had his real name – Charles Allen Lechmere – a mass of incriminating evidence became clear.  Lechmereʼs job, home and family tie him to every Ripper crime. Christer travels to London to explore the Nichols murder in forensic detail. Did Jack the Ripper manage to lie his way past the police to kill again?"

Throughout much of the 70s he was mostly drifting from place to place, his activities largely unknown.  There was a woman known to have been traveling with him that was never seen again, but that's very inconclusive.    However, I think the man had been killing for quite some time and must have taken at least 60 lives (like many law enforcement speculate).  The toy box, appearing in the early 90s, was the culmination of his killing career.  He made his perfect method, and who knows how many victims, alive or dead, that were exposed to that hell.

First of all, our police department had a primary suspect for West Mesa, but he was killed during a dispute with the boyfriend of what may have been another potential victim.  Secondly, despite Yancy and Hendy's claims of victims across Arizona and New Mexico, it's such a long drive between Elephant Butte where he lived and Albuquerque that it just doesn't seem practical.  And the spot on the mesa where they found the bodies is a little out of the way if you're moving to and from Arizona.   Meanwhile the Elephant Butte area is filled with homes that aren't used year round and the surrounding area is so relatively desolate, it would be easy to hide bodies out there without getting caught.  Not so much with the West Mesa where the city is rapidly expanding, making it harder and harder to use that area as a ""safe"" dumping ground."

serialkillers,2mezxf,dcred123,5,Sun Nov 16 17:37:06 2014 UTC,"He's not my ""favorite"" but I think Donald ""Pee Wee"" Gaskins is an interesting person. Mostly because he was just such a ""character"". Seems like he was a real asshole too.  Some interesting stuff about him:   He was a tiny man, hence the nickname, and was constantly trying to be the tough guy.   He drove a hearse with a bumper sticker that said ""I haul dead bodies""  During his first period in jail, he was sexually assaulted by by another prisoner so he cut the throat of his attacker. He escaped by hiding in a garbage truck.  He separated his murders in Coastal killings and Serious killings. In the former, he tortured and killed hitchhikers. In the latter, he assaulted and shot people who pissed him off or for money.  After his final arrest and while on death row, he was paid to kill another death row inmate. (from wikipedia) ""Gaskins initially made several unsuccessful attempts to kill Tyner by lacing his food and drink with poison before he opted to use explosives to kill him. To accomplish this, Gaskins rigged a device similar to a portable radio in Tyner's death row cell and told Tyner this would allow them to ""communicate between cells"".[12] When Tyner followed Gaskins' instructions to hold a speaker (laden with C-4 plastic explosive, unbeknownst to him) to his ear at an agreed time, Gaskins detonated the explosives in his cell and killed him.[11] Gaskins later said, ""The last thing he [Tyner] heard was me laughing.""""  Gaskins was tried for the murder of Rudolph Tyner and sentenced to death.   He is the only man to have ever killed an inmate on death row.  Anyways, I always thought his life would make a good film. He's basically just an evil dude. He's a lifelong criminal who just never did the right thing, he was always up to something illegal or deviant. Like I said, not my favorite... but someone who doesn't get a lot of discussion."

He can be calm, speaking confidently and logically, a reasonable man, perhaps even someone who you'd like to get to know (and this effect was apparently much more significant in person). Then, with no transition whatsoever, he becomes a gibbering madman, the very image of the lunatic in the straightjacket and rubber room. And then, just as suddenly, he's calm again, but glaring with such intense malice that one would easily ascribe his demeanor to Satan himself.  It's been claimed that he's perfectly sane, and the entire thing is an attempt to garner sympathy via mental illness. But we can't tell for sure. There is no way of knowing whether this is a cold, calculating, monster of a man, or a pathetic, unstable bastard with a tenuous grasp on reality.

Taking a plane and then driving 500+ miles to kill a totally random victim, burying caches of weapons years in advance, hiding the bodies so well that most haven't even been found, etc. He also didn't have a victim profile, and nobody even knew there was a serial killer until after he was arrested for the murder of Samantha Koenig in 2012.

He answered all of the victims questions in the end, he admitted to everything that he had done... And a lot of people don't lay out everything on the table. He kind of reminds me of Ed Kemper.  He also killed because he didn't want them to leave. He had major abandonment issues. He couldn't have sex with them when they were alive, because of some deep shame or insecurity or something like that.  Of course what he did was wrong, but it's not like he did it out of hatred.

serialkillers,2mcj1l,CarmenEtTerror,5,Sat Nov 15 08:23:43 2014 UTC,"Guilty as charged.  I think part of it is how post-capture Kemper acts like a human being.  You listen to Gacy or Ramirez or Dahmer or Bundy or Wuornos or most of the others talk about their crimes, and there's no feeling of remorse at all.  They're sociopaths and frequently narcissists, and they can't conceive of what they did as actually wrong.  You get this sense that their crimes were inevitable, that they never could have been anything else.  Kemper reads as something different.  He's aware of how terrible what he did was, how absurd some of the situations were.  Can you imagine Bundy telling you how he lost his keys during a murder because he was freaking out so much?  He also turned himself in, which is unusual if not unique.  Of course, it's entirely possibly that this is all learned behavior.  Kemper's intelligence is almost cliche at this point, and the other exceptionally bright killers (Alcala, Bundy) are too busy trying to get themselves off the hook to be able to fake remorse.  That's never been a realistic goal for Kemper, but maybe playing the repentant, sensitive genius gets him something."

It's why their so uncommon, when their originating circumstances are often so common.   So that's why you see people as diverse as Edmund Kemper and Ed Gein and Jeffery Dahmer and John Wayne Gacy and Albert Fish. Because whatever makes them a serial killer isn't the common experiences they had, it' the intrinsic nature of something within them.  Like, if you gave Edmund Kemper a normal childhood, he'd just have started killing people for some other reason."

I don't believe a word he says when he begins to blame it on his mother and upbringing. He killed because he enjoyed killing. It is the same reason while people golf or fish. He simply enjoyed the sport of killing women. It was exciting (for whatever reason)  and he'd probably do it again if he could."
serialkillers,2mcj1l,ArcticEel,11,Sat Nov 15 15:38:24 2014 UTC,"Not really fair to say whether or not his upbringing affected him in this fashion. You'd be surprised by what past scars and torment can do to a person.  Also, what's with your statistics? One in ten people? Most certainly not. Sociopathy is present in less than 1% of the population. Still looking for a source for this, but it is most certainly not one in ten.  EDIT: Just like to add, diagnosing true APD (sociopathy) can be difficult (as can diagnosing any mental illness). Statistics vary, but to imagine that 10% of the population is afflicted with sociopathy is just cray cray."
serialkillers,2mcj1l,EnIdiot,-2,Sat Nov 15 19:18:58 2014 UTC,"Stout's Sociopath Next Door puts sociopathy at 4% of the population. I am a believe in the Pareto principle of things breaking along a 20% \ 80% rule. I also believe that there is a gray line between where sociopathy begins and ends. My reasoning (or guess) is that 10% of the population is overly altruistic and empathetic and around 10% is overly self-centered and without much if any empathy.  Of this 10%, 2 of 10 are  dangerous killers or potential killers and 8 in 10 are just your run of the mill self-centered assholes. I of course have no hard data to back this up (other than Stout's statistics). From personal experience, I have found sociopaths to ALWAYS be lying even when it doesn't have any benefit. This guy is going to be lying for the sake of lying.  I don't know what his immediate gain is by lying (maybe it is to make himself feel better). These guys are also great self-deceivers."

The issue was with women, of course. And it was all because of the relationship he had with his mother. Another example of how important it is for a child his own mother, and any signs of rejection or cruelty from her part is a recipe to make a monster out of a child, who needs validation and love from the main caregiver.  This is another example about how a lot of serial killers and mass murderers act out of a very passionate rage they have either towards their own cold and distant mothers or people who reject them.

serialkillers,2m8rtd,pbizzle,4,Fri Nov 14 10:20:35 2014 UTC,"I believe Alcala's victims were all women he had photographed (model type photographs).  Since nobody knows the exact number of victims Alcala took, the theory is that some of the women in these photographs could also be potential murder victims.  Some of the women (very few), have come forward and ID'd themselves, as being the ones in the pictures."

I'm pretty damn sure that he killed in Pennsylvania throughout the 20s through to the 40s, the trouble comes in nailing down which of Pennsylvania's many decapitation killings can be attributed to him.

serialkillers,2m7q9l,_rattlesnake,3,Thu Nov 13 21:42:54 2014 UTC,"I realized recently that Aileen Wuornos is probably the one serial killer that I feel the most pity for. How her life went so incredibly sideways is astounding. At every intersection of her life, if she was given a choice between a good decision and a bad one, she'd take the bad one. Those bad decisions just kept piling up, from drugs to prostitution to murder to serial murder. She was a walking train wreck.  I also have a hard time believing she was as much of a psychopath as she is made out to be. Yes, she could be manipulative, but I think it was something she learned as a survival tactic, not something that was inherent to her psychology. Reading up on her and watching her interviews have made me question a lot of things about how she was portrayed, even by herself. The quote by Nick Broomfield has stuck with me since I first read it:    I think this anger developed inside her. And she was working as a prostitute. I think she had a lot of awful encounters on the roads. And I think this anger just spilled out from inside her. And finally exploded. Into incredible violence. That was her way of surviving. I think Aileen really believed that she had killed in self-defense. I think someone who's deeply psychotic can't really tell the difference between something that is life threatening and something that is a minor disagreement, that you could say something that she didn't agree with. She would get into a screaming black temper about it. And I think that's what had caused these things to happen. And at the same time, when she wasn't in those extreme moods, there was an incredible humanity to her."

His birthday is a day before mine. He's the eldest sibling. His parents divorced. He was a troublemaker but also an introvert. I also am into some really sick sexual things that he liked and sometimes that scares the shit out of me.  To be honest, I used to dissect slugs in the back alley behind my mom's house, and I go into the forest at times and just look around at dead things if they are around and I would poke at them up into my late adolescent years.  I, of course, am not a serial killer. But I can definitely feel him and where he is coming from and I have TONS of compassion towards him.  Ed Kemper hates his mother, and I love the fact that he tried to dispose of his mother's vocal chords in the garbage disposal. I have a deep hatred for my mother and I sometimes wanted to fucking hit her in the fucking throat when she was yelling at me with her annoying accent."

With the DNA and other evidence, he's likely to be doomed if he gets arrested for anything else.  We had a case recently in our area where instead of using an anchor point on a known suspect, subsequently arrested, they tried to find the body by using the ""missing persons"" rules about a radius out from last known sighting of the victim, which for someone her age was about 8 miles for a person her age to wander if ""lost."" When her body was recovered, it was laughably close to major anchors--his mother's house, the site where a previous victim's body was found etc.  It's really unfortunate that police do not uniformly use and understand this."

If he wasn't charged with a felony then he wouldn't have been incarcerated long enough to affect him killing. I don't believe he has relocated either --though it is possible--his knowledge of the area is great which tells me he has been around that area for a very long time and he is comfortable where he is, right now he is in no danger of being caught so there is no reason to leave.   He has shown he can take long breaks between murders, so it is possible he is taking a break (not uncommon in serial killers, they don't stop killing, but they can take breaks if circumstances permit).   What leads me to believe his criminal sophistication may be progressing is the fact that when police obtained his tire tracks, he got rid of his tires (the exact tires were later found in a junkyard). Also his last victim took longer to find than the others because she was a little more concealed in an area she was not likely to be found right away.  This may mean he is taking more steps to conceal his crimes and his victims. It may have progressed to further victims that have not been found.  It really is surprising that geographic profiling is not a more commonly used method. If you look at the accuracy of Dr. Godwin's geographic profiles it's ridiculous that method isn't taken more seriously."
serialkillers,2m2vk8,Mrs_Fonebone,1 point,Wed Nov 12 17:25:05 2014 UTC,"Dennis Rader, a.k.a. The B.T.K. Killer, stopped killing.  He never stopped stalking but he stopped killing - mostly because he felt that as he aged he could himself be overpowered by a potential victim.   You make a very good point about DNA and the possibility of the perp being incarcerated.   Does Dr. Godwin still reside in Raleigh?  His methods are very interesting."
serialkillers,2m2vk8,b4xt3r,1 point,Sun Nov 23 23:33:20 2014 UTC,Not to get off topic but Dennis Rader's breaks in killing were due to him fulfilling his fantasies in other ways that would slightly subdue the urge to kill. He would do this by dressing himself in bondage and such and taking photos. He would draw and write out his fantasies or act it out on dolls. This would slightly drop his fantasy driven urge to kill.   Dr. Godwin is in Fayetteville if I recall correctly.

I believe it can be purchased on Amazon. The film focused quite a bit on that case (interviews with wayne Henley, his mother, a lot of focus on his art, interviews with victims families and people involved in the case, and shows them visiting Corlls candy shop, house, the boat sheds, etc.). One of the men in the film was the one that recently found what is believed to be a torture photo that was discarded with everything from Wayne's room, by Wayne's mom in a nearby abandoned bus at the time of Wayne's arrest.

The victims did nothing wrong, they didn't make any mistakes, they share no blame. We SHOULD trust people and be helpful and friendly.  Serial killers prey on that helpful instinct that good people have. That's why THEY are bad people and are at fault in these situations."
serialkillers,2lz26n,TonyFuckingDanza,13,Wed Nov 12 00:42:36 2014 UTC,"Remember that for some of the ones he gave a ride, he dressed up as a cop and made them think they had no choice but to accompany him.  Other times, if he could get away with it, he would club them in the head near his car and then hurry them away.  There were a lot of different ways one would be doomed under Ted's sights, there's a reason only one escaped."
serialkillers,2lz26n,_rattlesnake,3,Tue Nov 11 17:03:27 2014 UTC,"You are correct. But in some cases, girls had the choice - they could either follow him to his car, or they could not. Not all of them did.  He just kept approaching them. Persistence brings success?"
serialkillers,2lz26n,SomeWaySomeHow,9,Tue Nov 11 17:51:47 2014 UTC,"Persistence brings success? If you're asking people out - statistics say you probably will succeed with someone eventually, no matter who you are. He had a type and he was hunting it.  Unloading a sailboat at Lake Sammamish -   First question to self, ""Why doesn't he ask men? Why just one other person, who happens to be obviously alone ect. instead of in the obviously crowded parking-lot?""   Photos of him inside his infamous VW exist from that day when he kidnapped and killed two girls from Lake Sammamish. The parking-lot was loaded with people. (The girls would have probably assumed they were being led to a fairly populated parking-lot, at least the first girl early in the day).  He later admitted, using a third-person ""hypothetical"" scenario that ""One might""... keep one girl alive, restrained, say in a basement of a friend's house, while he went back to (kidnap) the other,   (somewhere there has been a double-murder and the home-owners never knew it occurred in their house while they lived there).    A girl would need to be flattered enough by his attention/helpful and willing by nature/personality so that she'd politely acquiesce in a timely manner. I think by then he was pretty good at singling that type of girl out, and used different ploys for different scenarios conquests, or even fetish (as in Carol DaRonch's case);  You might follow a man to his car on a holiday weekend in bright daylight from a crowded public area - but the tactic would have to be entirely different to make you feel willing to follow a man to a car in a dark mall parking-lot, (I hope).    Next question: ""Where the hell is the sailboat?"" (He didn't even have one).  Check-out the things people fall for on reddit everyday."

serialkillers,2lz26n,sweetabix,1 point,Tue Nov 11 17:52:05 2014 UTC,"""murder porn"" is a genre I just recently gave up. It started innocently by reading a huge number of Agatha Christie books I found in the basement of the house I'm renting. When I'd finished all 38 of them, I had acquired a taste for distraction via fiction and sought more. There were boxes and boxes of murder porn in the basement and some of the things I ended up reading have left lesions on my brain due to the intensity of evil, cruelty, perversion and suffering depicted. For a while, I got hooked and read even though it left me shaken.  I read too much of it over the past few months and finally I decided it was OK to censor what impinges upon my brain at bit more conscientiously.  It can be overwhelming to discover the twisted, horrific things our kind is capable of doing to one another. I kind of wish I didn't know people could be so insanely vicious and demonic. These days, I chose to live with dogs instead of humans because dogs don't do shit like that ever. I believe my species, me included of course, is becoming increasingly unstable from having been raised in a society increasingly devoid of a sane social context in which to act appropriately to the benefit of all.  As someone else said above, these sadistic killers are made not born that way."
serialkillers,2lz26n,TonyFuckingDanza,-3,Wed Nov 12 00:45:19 2014 UTC,"In the end, I went from hating Bundy to feeling sad for him.  Don't get me wrong, I feel for the victims, and I don't condone or excuse what he did, but he's a victim of sorts himself."

I would definitely fall for helping a guy with a cast on move something. I am a big sucker for helping people. In fact, since I have read that book (and seen Silence of the Lambs) several times there's been a number of times in my life where I have been helping someone with something and think, 'Oh man. I hope this guy isn't pretending to need help so that he can murder me...'  I would probably fall for someone approaching me in the mall to say that he was security/plain clothes policeman and my car had been vandalized and I needed to follow him so that we could inspect the damage, but I can't see myself getting into his 'unmarked' police car to go to the station.   I remember from the book that one of the girls said that her car looked fine and so she declined going to the station to file a report, but that he was just incredibly insistent, so she finally gave in.  I can't say that I would get a bad feeling or distrust his story about being a cop, but I am just the kind of person who can't be bothered. I am the sort that if someone rearends me and my car looks fine I just tell them to go on instead of wasting the time to call the police and swap insurance. So if my car looked fine I would be pretty adamant to the 'cop' that I didn't want to go anywhere to file a report.  But attitude is half the battle and he obviously must have had a very self-assured manner about him that suggested he really was a plain clothes policeman, so I can't honestly say that I would be suspicious of his story."
serialkillers,2lz26n,keylemonpie,3,Wed Nov 12 00:14:12 2014 UTC,"I read this book a while ago, and yes, I've often thought about what I would have done. Back then -- in the 70's -- we were a little more trusting. At least I was! I was young and stupid, and very insecure. If a handsome guy approached me for any reason, I probably would've gone off with him. It haunts me still that I was in Utah when Bundy was there. It could've been me. That's how young and dumb I was."

I'm not a very trusting person, though. He hit them pretty quickly, so there probably wasn't much more than simply pushing them into the car.  I hated the book.  Ann Rule came off as a delusional single mother, in love with Ted. She marginalized his crimes, & doesn't even mention his necrophilia.  Ted totally put her in the 'friendzone' yet she still sends him money. He manipulated her to the end. Worst of all, the book gives the impression she never realized it.

There was a train bridge there and we used to smoke weed underneath it. One day we were heading out there to smoke and when we came near the bridge area we saw several police cars, we decided that was a good time to leave. We found out later that the place we had been going to smoke weed was the burial site of Colleen Reed. She was killed and buried there by Kenneth Allen McDuff.

Dahmer was, despite all the horrible things he did, a quirky character. I can't think of another serial killer that is like Dahmer. There was something incredibly human about him that you just can't see in people like Kemper and Bundy.  The Dahmer files was so great because of the quirky little cut scenes with Dahmer. You couldn't have that in a Bundy, Kemper or Fish documentary. When I think of Dahmer, I think ""Pathetic"", when I think of any other serial killer I think ""Pyscho"", ""Evil"" and ""Weirdo"". I don't know what it is about Dahmer..."

serialkillers,2le9v9,Psychopath-,0,Wed Nov 5 21:27:52 2014 UTC,"I'm curious, OP - you've said before you're relatively well-versed in the subject. Do you have an opinion on suicide in psychopaths?  I was taught early on that since we have a psychology that puts ourselves and our own lives ahead of any and everything else, suicide is highly unlikely. But Fred West killed himself. Jack Unterweger killed himself. Those are off the top of my head, and their psychopathy isn't up for debate as far as I'm aware.  Anyway, after that early lesson, I was always taught that psychopaths have a relatively high incidence of suicidal ideation. I've always thought the latter is more accurate - I'm a diagnosed psychopath and I am/have been suicidal - but anecdotal evidence =/= fact. Do you have any information or opinions on the subject?  Edit: Not only that, but Charlie Brandt and Herb Baumeister committed suicide before even being caught, I think that's even more interesting."
serialkillers,2le9v9,CommentCop,2,Wed Nov 5 21:29:38 2014 UTC,"Well I try not to lump people in together and say they are all the same. In the case of Brandt, his suicide was an act of control. He knew the jig was up after killing his wife and niece. From all accounts of people that knew him, he was a control freak and was extremely meticulous (I know his case very well and consulted with one of the authors about it in the book about his case ""Invisible Killer""). Same with Maury Travis and Israel Keyes. Their suicides also were acts of control. It's not about psychopathy, it's about control in their cases."

I'd do things people would tell me were wrong and I couldn't understand why. I mean... I could grasp it on an intellectual level but there was no conviction behind it, no emotional switch that flipped when I was doing something I shouldn't be. It was nice to finally understand what I was. I was happy to have some frame of reference for my experiences.  Don't know if that makes sense or answers your question. Hope so."

serialkillers,2la546,a1ex1985,20,Tue Nov 4 18:01:30 2014 UTC,"The title is a little inaccurate; Unterweger's first murder conviction was never overturned. He served 16 years of his sentence, then was released. Austrian law (at least now, I think it was the same at the time) allows prisoners on life sentences to be paroled after 15 years if prison officials believe there's no risk of their re-offending. Unterweger was functionally illiterate when he was incarcerated, so the fact that he had gone from that to being able to produce work that was widely believed to have some literary merit swung things quite heavily in his favour in painting him as a reformed person who had worked hard in prison to better himself, and a lot of people in Austria's literary scene campaigned for his release. Turns out that was a mistake, though I think it's more a testimony to Unterweger's calculating manipulation and cunning than to any great naivete.  The most incredible thing about Unterweger, to my mind, is the level of confidence he showed in killing outside of any environmental comfort zone. The fact that he almost certainly killed three women during a short business trip to LA in 1991 is chilling; I'm not sure if he even spoke English very well. It shows a terrifying level of bravado."
serialkillers,2la546,Quietuus,6,Tue Nov 4 18:34:35 2014 UTC,"He actually did a ride-along with the LAPD, telling them he was doing a story on the prostitution in the city.  While he was there 3 prostitutes were found strangled with their bras.  Nobody connected the crimes until he was back in Austria.  The confidence he shows here is just incredible.  He travels across the world, inserts himself into the police force in a way that associates him in their mind with prostitution, and then goes on to murder three prostitutes using his signature method.  The balls on this guy.  Additionally, he was a key reporter on his own slayings in Vienna.  He spoke with the police chief and produced radio shows and newspaper articles.    I've never read a full length book on this character, but I'm going to have to soon.  I've listened to podcasts and read articles about him and he's incredibly fascinating."

As a serial killer enthusiast and a woman, this is a subject I love to read about. Ive come across several theories on why female serialkillers are overlooked, or just not caught, compared to the male ones, the popular ones:  We as a society deem women weak, passive and homely. It is very hard to imagine a woman killing her children, husbands and relatives.  Women are less likely to kill random victims in a violent and torturous fashion. We like Dahmer, BTK and Bundy because of the sexual violence combined with the fear of The Stranger, theyre just so scary! Angels of death (lots of women in this ""category"") are just not very...enticing.  There are probably a lot more female serial killers than we know about. Not the same amount as men, because lets face it men ARE more likely to commit violent acts, but a hidden number because of previously stated points.   Women that we do know about usually kill ""smart"". They kill husbands, children, parents, people in their care etc. They usually do it in a less violent fashion, ones we overlook as natural death. I for one find them even more interesting because of it, especially women who murder their children.  Folbigg is a favourite of mine."

After I appeared on the Oprah Winfrey show in 2009, I received hundreds of emails from family members of other serial killers thanking me for telling my story, and asking for help and advice [...] I've created a whole network of people like me - daughters, sons, siblings, parents and grandparents of serial killers. So far, I have had direct contact with more than 300 people like this - we are an underground community.   That's interesting, usually we just care about the family's victims, but the serial killer's family suffers a lot too.   Reading this I immediately remembered that book/movie ""We need to talk about Kevin""."

Not that he currently is one, but that he certainly has potential to become one. I don't want to feel this way about him, but there are things that he has said to me in the past that make me think that he has it in him. But saying things and acting on them are 2 very different things. Of course you don't want to believe that your loved one is a serial killer. Ted Bundy's mother didn't acknowledge it until the day he was executed, when he confessed to her. I think it was about 10 years after he was sentenced, too. I can't imagine what it would be like to think ""hey thats' a weird thing that this person just said"" and then later find out that they were referencing actually killing someone. Chills!"

serialkillers,2l4976,hysteronproteron,2,Mon Nov 3 13:04:58 2014 UTC,"Well one big thing is, once when we were alone, I was probably about 20 and he was 24, he says to me ""You ever just want to go kill someone?"" I said ''what?"" And he said ""You know, just go to a town you've never been to, kill someone, and then never go back there? They'd never catch you that way.""   Then there was when our father was really sick. He and my brother never got along and my brother was the one helping my mom take care of my dad before he died. I will admit that my dad took a lot of unnecessary shit out on my brother, but my brother's reaction scared me to the point that I was gathering information to turn him over to Adult Protective Services. My dad was paralyzed from a car accident and couldn't walk. He was also on dialysis and his machine was upstairs. My dad pissed my brother off one day and my brother refused to help him up the stairs. My dad had to crawl up the stairs by himself. The worst thing, though, was that my brother once left my dad upstairs, alone for 8 hours. My dad was in his dialysis chair and wasn't strong enough to get into his wheelchair to get food or even go to the bathroom. My dad screamed and screamed for him. I was the one who came over and found my dad like that, screaming. He told me my brother had left him there. I asked my brother later what the hell he was thinking and his exact words were ""I was hoping that I would come upstairs and he would be dead.""  He also made comments to me about how he wouldn't be surprised if my dad ""accidentally overdosed"" on some of his medicine. He said all this in an email and I was preparing it to turn him in when our dad died. He died of kidney failure so I know my brother didn't have anything to do with it. But I think if there was more time, my brother may have killed him. And to me, anyone who can probably kill their own father can probably be a serial killer."

I thought Derf showed a lot of compassion (as much as you could express for someone who turned out to be a horrible serial killer) in the way he told the story. A lot of it is hindsight but you could see how they all felt sorry for him and clearly saw that he had problems (like when he downed a six pack on a 10 minute drive to the mall). Of course as kids they never thought to address these things.  Such an excellent book though. I've only got the 28-page version and I can't seem to find the full graphic novel online.

I think he would have been much better off without them. They used him as a pet and/or twisted entertainment. If anything, the abandonment  he felt after the day at the mall (which was their idea) was definitely comparable to what he experienced a lot of his life. Lastly, they learned he was troubled that day and had no support, but left him to be. I understand times were different, but I just cannot help but analyze that as a catalyst to the murders. His first one was not long after that."

But again, no one at the time could have imagined the extent of his depravity. In that decade, to a typical high school kid, it probably would've made most sense to leave him alone.  His first murder wasn't long after graduation but it was a long time coming. Remember he had planned his first to be the jogger he stalked near his house, but on the day he set out to do it the jogger failed to show up.

She's written lots of true crime, all very well-researched and written, but this one is about Ted Bundy who she worked with at a suicide hotline (yes, really) and was friends with nearly until his death.   The other is A Father's Story by Lionel Dahmer. It was written by Jeffrey's father, but it doesn't shy away from the facts. Absolutely the best book I've ever read about him. It doesn't sensationalize it and it doesn't sugarcoat it and it contains odd stories you wouldn't find elsewhere--like normal things that happened in their lives right alongside Jeff's killings.

But that's only one particular outcome for one particular mindset. It's also conceivable that they would be encouraged and appreciate the input.  For example, my most inspiring professor always proclaimed that he never wanted to know what he was doing right.  He only wanted to know what he was doing wrong.  For him that was the clear path to improvement.  He thought artificially skewing input to the positive, would ultimately have a negative effect on society, pushing everyone into a false sense of accomplishment, and perpetuating incompetence. Different people respond differently to each and every situation, and it's essentially impossible to know how someone will respond from a single, isolated post.   thus making a neutral, honest comment a more reliable, robust policy.   In germany, they have an expression ""'nice' is the little brother of shit.""  unsolicited niceties are considered rude and insincere, so while you consider it rude to be blunt and direct, there are millions of people who believe the exact opposite to be true.  Considering your opinion to be a universal absolute is why i thought it came off as high-and-mighty(and amusingly hypocritical).  And look back at my original comment.  I didn't say anything egregious or unnecessarily negative or positive.  Any negativity you see is probably a projection on your part.   I frequent a sub called /r/RedditGetsDrawn, and it's a pretty big rule there for the same reason. Same with /r/makeupaddiction - only add CC if requested.

Just want OP to know that his work is appreciated and would like to see more! :)   but at the time of this post you didn't actually do that.  all you did was criticize me for criticizing him.  if you feel that way, maybe you should leave a root-level comment. after all, that's what reddit is for, and OP is more likely to see it that way."

It appears that the only reason he was caught was because he left his victim in the motel room; I'm guessing he rented the room or was caught on camera and that's how they tracked him down.

serialkillers,2kecv2,PorkedPork,3,Sun Oct 26 23:21:07 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the link. I can't imagine he was planning on going back. To my knowledge most, if not all, motels have a cleaning crew go through the room after the check out time has hit so unless he booked the room for multiple days he'd have to have known that she would be discovered soon.   Maybe she booked the room solo and he figured he was safe. I know anytime I've stayed at a motel they've scanned my license so I can only guess he didn't want to risk that. I'm thinking he might have been caught on camera and that's how he was identified. Purely speculation on my part, but I feel like if he had given his information at the front desk/office area of the motel he either would have gone into hiding or checked out the room for longer so he'd have more time to move the body. The fact that he just went back to his house leads me to believe he felt somewhat in the clear. That, or maybe he was planning on leaving and that's why he made the comment about being surprised by how quickly he was located."

serialkillers,2kecv2,PorkedPork,3,Sun Oct 26 22:35:59 2014 UTC,"I can guarantee he did not want to be caught for attention. M.O. Changes and evolves, that's very common as killers get more comfortable. Also the circumstances of a specific crime play out differently then expected for the offender and that can throw a wrench in their routine. He seemed to be a fairly organized style of serial killer (had a chosen victim type, picked his victims a specific way for the most part, knew how he wanted to kill them, and knew where he wanted to dump them). He has been getting away with it for so long I believe he became comfortable and felt he wouldn't be tied to this murder, he got careless and that reflects in his willingness to confess to the other murders he wasn't linked to at all, he just didn't care anymore for some reason."

He could have walked out of the interrogation room at any point but it would have been only delaying the inevitable.  He chose to talk to save them and himself some time.  During the beginning of the interview (about 40 minutes in) you can see the wheels turning in his head trying to decide what to do.  At that point the investigator knew he got his guy."

The reason i think dean corll isn't more widely regarded is because all they have is like 2 photos of him and the police never got to interview him, with people like Ted Bundy and Jeffrey Dahmer they literally have hours of confessions and other footage, makes it so much more interesting, but without that i suppose it makes the character more of a mystery!  There is also gary ridgeway, the green river killer! hid his other life from his wife for what...15 years or something lol  I live in the UK, there isn't much serial killings going on round here, but about 7 years ago or something there was one man who went around killing prostitutes, his name was Steve Wright aka the Suffolk strangler! horrible bloke, its terrible what he did but it was also very interesting keeping up with the case, knowing that someone like that lived in my town, maybe even walking past me in he streets!"

serialkillers,2kdj3n,foreverhaunted21,2,Tue Oct 28 21:29:10 2014 UTC,"It's not what I would call normal, but I too understand the obsession. For me it has waned, I don't really think about it much anymore, but I think I have a more morbid way of thinking than normal people I guess. It started ten years ago, my father found me on social media and began cyber stalking me. I had never had contact with him since he left when I was an infant, and he wasn't really the kind of person who should be around kids anyway..   After all the weird and sick things he would message me, I being the type of person I am, decided to research what kind of person would do that. It led me to serial killers and criminals and I wanted to learn everything about them, and how they thought and why they were how they were. Sick stuff, but to me it kind of explained things. It sounds creepy, but it has helped me to be more aware of people, and their possible ill intentions. I became a better judge of character, not that I was bad before, but I have a better sense of the evil that people are capable of. It also helped me in the general sense of my self being. All my life I was told how much like my father I was in regards to intelligence and temper. ( I admit I have a short temper at times, though I do have self control and am mostly very laid back) It helped me realize that I couldn't ever be like him, or like serial killers for that matter. I also find it sad that people like this exist, everyone deserves to be loved and cared for, and so many of them weren't, I always wondered what would have become of them if they were shown more kindness in their life. I understand that it isn't all due to that but still..   Sorry long post, but just saying it's normal to want to learn about something. Bundy was always interesting, to me it's proof of how crazy some girls can be about good looking guys. Dude was a serial killer and had girls in the courtroom that were like his groupies. I don't understand it, or that rapist that's been in the news recently with the ""beautiful eyes"" sorry don't remember his name. I can admit this on Reddit, I don't bring it up in conversation or anything, my family thinks I'm weird enough, and the few other people that know think it's weird because I'm a woman."

serialkillers,2k90gn,sharkattax,9,Sat Oct 25 01:50:55 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the link, but I'm pretty sure I've seen all the interviews that are on youtube. There are endless documentaries on serial killers, but almost no documentary-quality interviews with them, where the killer can talk about his story etc.  I saw a very short and old video interview Elmer Wayne Henley, but it was only part of a bigger documentary, and they barely asked him about anything. From what I can tell, he is incredibly remorseful, and considers himself a monster. Why doesn't anyone go get a real video interview with him where he can talk about Dean Corll and all the things he did?"
serialkillers,2k90gn,sharkattax,3,Sat Oct 25 02:11:38 2014 UTC,"Yeah, sorry, my post doesn't really answer your question at all. I just thought it was relevant and potentially interesting. Unfortunately, I don't have an answer to your question."

serialkillers,2k90gn,tadskis,3,Sat Oct 25 03:11:12 2014 UTC,"You won't ever find an interview like this with Paul Bernardo. There is a ban on him speaking to the media and other than this police interview and his closed trial, he hasn't 'spoken' to the media since 1993. The ban was put in place by the prison citing Paul's safety as the reason.  Living in the area where he committed these crimes, every time his (or Karla's) name comes up things go a bit wonky. Karla's sister works at a local supermarket where, apparently, she has to stay in the office because people verbally abuse her and spit on her. Whenever Paul and Karla get in the news again the abuse on Karla's family starts up as the whole thing is rehashed. It is a very sensitive subject around here.  That said, this video is really difficult to watch. When he starts getting very indignant about his rights as a Canadian I just want to punch him in the throat."

serialkillers,2k90gn,OUFan2,4,Tue Oct 28 21:45:32 2014 UTC,"Let me provide a different point of view again...  I don't work in a prison, but I do work in a county jail (pre-trial detainees etc) and a lot of high profiles are given air time with local media to speak. We are also a very high profile agency, so we have appeared in many TV shows. We will not supply on duty staff for the filming. It would not be ethical for the public to pay our salary while doing a private, not work based, project. Because of this, the shows, interviewers pay to have escorts and officers stand by to provide security during the process. (Of course local media cases are not included with this of course. So figure in two officers, each pulling in their normal pay (no one is going to take a pay cut to stand around at work and have the possibility that if something goes south, having to do paperwork, or maybe end up in court.) so that's $23 an hour per officer currently. Considering how tight most documentary budgets are to begin with, this could be a huge deal breaker. It'd be a lot easier to do a 30 minute phone call few times and do the interview that way I'd think."

serialkillers,2k90gn,splinteredruler,6,Sat Oct 25 03:09:37 2014 UTC,"Ah okay. Well, a lot of the documentary length stuff probably isn't available due to:  a) Prison protocol. They've got a schedule, they're got visitation rights, they're got rules. A reporter isn't usually able to bend these to any large degree. John Wayne Gacy has a long interview starting here (not great quality, but decent).  b) If they're pleading innocent and maintaining that, there's only so much they can talk without possibly sharing too many details (again, Gacy's interview is a good example of this).  c) A lot of the killers probably just don't want to talk."

""Her boyfriend was killed,"" Wayne says today. ""Dean tried to kill her. Her friend [referring to himself], whom she trusted implicitly, we know turned out to be a monster. So who's the victim?"""

serialkillers,2k0xck,Annajbanana,5,Tue Nov 11 09:18:17 2014 UTC,"Elmer Wayne Henley once told me ""Sometimes I wish Dean just killed me that night"". Knowing the situation and having someone say that to me is one of the heaviest things my brain has had to process."

serialkillers,2k0xck,drunkwithlust,3,Tue Nov 11 10:08:53 2014 UTC,People can be so vile. Such an interesting and insightful read. Would definitely read the book if she brought one out.

serialkillers,2k2hly,CallMeCrow,1 point,Thu Oct 23 18:13:09 2014 UTC,"I love all of John Douglas' books (though I hear he's a bit insufferable in real life), as well as The Stranger Beside Me by Ann Rule, Conversations w/ a Killer by Steve Michaud and Hugh Aynesworth, and Defending the Devil by Polly Nelson (all books about Ted Bundy)."
serialkillers,2k2hly,jiggabot,1 point,Fri Oct 24 03:29:30 2014 UTC,Zodiac by Robert Graysmith is fascinating.  Helter Skelter by Vincent Bugliosi is an interesting read.
