Voat,3dyh0n,TheLetter10,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:48:19 2015 UTC,"The state of voat is that I just had my posting privileges there quasi-revoked as I'm past -50 CCP.  The downvoat brigade there is strong.  I guess that's what I get for having the controversial view that it's offensive to refuse to refer to transgender people by the gender they identify as...  Making controversial comments on reddit is NBD: the comment karma means nothing, and you can get hundreds or more karma from a single stupid joke.  Comment Karma on voat is the difference between being restricted to 5 comments today, and being allowed to downvote.  In other words, don't go against the herd.  Maybe they'll iron out these issues in time, but it doesn't feel like a super welcoming community right now."
Voat,3dyh0n,Zeydon,2,Mon Jul 20 23:15:12 2015 UTC,What did you say?
Voat,3dyh0n,Zeydon,3,Mon Jul 20 23:27:00 2015 UTC,"Controversial comments in reverse chronological order.  Link to thread   Yes, well, you say it's a stretch to call it harassment, and I say it's a stretch to call it assault. It's a grey area, yet the sentiment of this thread seems to be that Zoey was way out of line while Ben did nothing wrong.  In any event, I'm not expecting this to go very far in court. Though who knows, I've been surprised before.   ....   It wasn't the questions that were verbal abuse, it was the constantly referring to her as a he. ""“What are your genetics, sir?"" was the straw the broke the proverbial camel's back. Ben was repeatedly referring to Zoey as a male, that is the issue.   ...   You're right, she did cross a line (at least from a PR perspective, if not a legal one); I just find it easy to empathize with why she did so, and I expect that many people would respond in a similar manner, if not more severely, were they to be put in the same situation. I can see the logic in your comparison to the Boston Riots. It's a shame that emotions can compromise the intentions of the oppressed, but its an incredibly human, and can happen just about anyhow. We're not logic robots; sometime emotions win out, even when you try real hard to not let them. And those being oppressed are held to a higher standard because they are under such intense scrutiny from the mainstream views, who are looking for any way, logical or not, to resist change. It's an emotional response that led Zoey to behave like she did, but it's also an emotional response to let her emotional response compromise the logic in her argument. In other words, if you dismiss her arguments just because she you think she behaved inappropriately, instead of the strength of the argument, then your decision making process is just as emotionally compromised as hers.   ...   If you insist on being called Dr. Anoxim, I have no problems calling you that. Doesn't mean you get to perform brain surgery, but if that's how you identify yourself, I respect you enough, as a fellow human, to refer to you as that. Dr. Dre is not actually a doctor either, yet people don't have problems calling him that.   ...   Again, this is not his argument she was having beef with; it was verbal abuse. How many times can you call a black man a nigger to his face before you get punched in yours? And again, this was not a punch, this was a much more measured approach than that. I'm not saying that I approve of letting anger getting the best of you, even under extreme duress, but every human has their limits, and Ben was remorselessly pushing Zoey to hers.  If it was his position on the validity of the award she was getting upset about, she would have reacted in-kind to Segun's comments, but she didn't because Segun was exhibiting a degree of professionalism.   ...   You can give a dissenting opinion without repeatedly insulting your opponent. Like, if there was a debate for and against marriage equality for homosexuals, it would be completely inappropriate for the person against marriage equality to call the other person a faggot every time they addressed them.  Literally nothing else was getting Ben to tone down his rhetoric, so Zoey did what she felt like she had to do to make it clear that his behavior was unacceptable. And it's not like she actually fought him backstage or in the parking lot."
Voat,3dyh0n,Zeydon,2,Mon Jul 20 23:47:04 2015 UTC,"Voat hates my people (trans), so no surprise."
Voat,3dyh0n,Zeydon,3,Tue Jul 21 00:21:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah... checking the new replies I'm getting there is only making me more and more disgusted by that community.  I'd assumed they'd be somewhat progressive, like reddit.  Learned my lesson.  I guess I should be happy it only took a week for me to see voat's true colors."
Voat,3dyh0n,Zeydon,2,Tue Jul 21 01:26:04 2015 UTC,"Well, at least someone agrees with me. We are clearly the minority in this thread though. Which blows my mind so much that I can't help but continue talking about it even though I'm losing all my hard-earned CCP (and I was so close to 20 too).   ...   Yeah, just like how a handshake is simple assault. It's not like she was trying to choke him out. Just applying a little bit of pressure so it would be clear that she is saying ""listen, you are clearly overstepping the bounds of what I find to be acceptable behavior."" Literally everyone else in that room was on Zoey's side when that situation occurred.   ...   There is no assault though. Zoe is insulted repeatedly by Ben, and so she gives the kind of idle threat many people would give in such a situation. The end.   ...   Anyhow, back on topic...  Ben Shapiro is behaving completely unprofessionally. He deliberately refers to a trans female as a male, and goes on and on about how respect is irrelevant and it's all about biology. But I don't get why he feels that this is necessary? Great, biology is important to how Ben identifies himself, we get that. But some people identify themselves differently. It's not hard to give people respect and treat them how they'd like to be treated. If you met Snoop Dogg, you wouldn't insist on referring to him as Snoop Mann would you? Yeah, he's not a dogg or a lion or whatever, but he's a person, and he wants to be referred to as a certain way. So just fucking respect it."

Not hating on Voat, I really like it and I guess it will settle down a bit.  Just hoping it doesn't become an anti-Reddit circlejerk and fatpeoplehate Mecca."

And yes I'm with you, I hope voat is it's own site and not just an anti-reddit site.  I think right now people are still mad so they want to bitch about it, but as long as reddit calms down with the crazy policies and the like I think in a month or two voat should calm down and it will be a nice place.

Voat,3dvzel,tolill,-1,Tue Jul 21 15:02:50 2015 UTC,"It's not currently strong enough to overtake reddit. But the potential is seen. The traffic to the site has been enormous over the past week or so. As most of us know, they had to shut down registrations because they couldn't keep up with the amount of traffic they were receiving. Also ""some kids fresh out of college"" can be a lot more influential than you think. Examples: facebook, Groupon, WordPress... etc. As the website grows and develops updates will be made and if users from reddit continue to flock to Voat, it will become a major competitor with reddit. It's hard to tell what's going to happen from this point. Once the updates to reddit's policies are released I think we will be able to tell."
Voat,3dvzel,idiopathic_toupee,-1,Tue Jul 21 16:39:14 2015 UTC,"apparently SJWs are trying to get it taken down as well.   Not at all surprising...

Proceeded to get downvoted to oblivion; so much so that I can currently only post 5 times a day (if you have -50 comment karma, your posting privileges are severely restricted).

Voat,3drmt9,MrBehnAm,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:34:01 2015 UTC,"I work in IT. When referring to cyber attacks, ""calling the cops"" is a pretty funny thing to say. They literally have zero ability to do anything about it nor would they even understand the concept. They also don't have jurisdiction.  At best, you need to engage the FBI. More realistically, you develop your platform to deal with it. You work with your ISP to filter things before they even get to your hosting platform. You then develop systems like that 5 second check and RECAPTCHA to remove the last annoying remnants of it.  When they get more money, they'll be able to afford better Intrusion Prevension Systems and more advanced load balancing solutions, etc. For now, they're using the best anti-DDoS methods that they can afford, not the best that exist."

Voat,3dsx4d,MonitoredCitizen,2,Sun Jul 19 03:38:45 2015 UTC,I have 3D:34:84:EB:0F:72:CC:95:B0:30:7B:3E:05:10:09:EE:DF:D4:57:1F  and no security errors. Mine is also from StartCom.
Voat,3dsx4d,PlasmaPower,2,Sun Jul 19 16:17:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks! It's a match so I think there's something minor broken rather than any fishiness going on. I dug into it a little more and found that if I use a browser that has only the ""Serial 18"" StartCom Class 1 cert and visit https://www.linux.com/ first, it seems to invalidate the cert and I cannot connect to anything signed by StartCom, including voat, after that. However, if I use a browser that has both the StartCom Class 1 serial 18 and serial 19 certs, then it's okay."
Voat,3dsx4d,PlasmaPower,2,Mon Jul 20 01:54:02 2015 UTC,That is really interesting! I would probably never have been able to figure that out :D.

Voat,3dl6yf,Tankbot85,3,Fri Jul 17 04:12:15 2015 UTC,The mods on that server are bad. Really bad. We should populate the server on the actual minecraft subverse. It is up and running now. The IP is: voatmc.com
Voat,3dl6yf,AJ34,2,Fri Jul 17 04:14:59 2015 UTC,I have been on the server for quite awhile. The mods are great. No problems so far. I have heard bad things about that server you posted.
Voat,3dl6yf,Tankbot85,5,Fri Jul 17 04:27:04 2015 UTC,"The mods on that server abuse their power. And the server i posted has not even been up for 20 hours yet, so how could you hear bad things about it? They server admin was going to give shit away for donations, but reversed it."
Voat,3dl6yf,AJ34,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:34:35 2015 UTC,The mods dont abuse their power. There are two admins who dont even play the game like the rest of us. Mods are just normal players. How have they abused their power?

Voat,3dhp3c,wuziwu,5,Thu Jul 16 19:56:58 2015 UTC,Just make some comments! The idea is to encourage users to contribute. Unfortunately the system in place encourages users to comment on front page posts rather than smaller subs.

It's on its way to be censored on a corporate scale, but some sub's mods have been fast and loose about interpreting rules to weed out content some don't like.  r/Russia has been deleting tame and benign posts under the ""false claims"" rule that don't portray Russia in a favourable light. Opinion, light sarcasm, or mentioning deletion of posts are all getting deleted there. I'm not sure if it's just a single ornery mod, but admins don't seem too concerned about it either.  Still waiting for a functional mobile Voat app though....."

I'm using boats and it functions reasonable well before the site locked up."
Voat,3dejlk,bluefire1717,6,Wed Jul 15 21:01:53 2015 UTC,As soon as boats and other mobile apps are back up. I'll be spending most of not all my reddit time over there.

Voat,3dejlk,evadingbelievers,16,Thu Jul 16 01:19:31 2015 UTC,"I find it odd that so many Redditors just assume (without even bothering to go look around at Voat) that Voat is where the ""Baddies"" went, and that its a meaner version of 4chan or something.  That it is some cesspool full of Nazis, the KKK, a misogynist society, and FPH.  In fact, it seems Voat is composed of a bunch of people who care about the site they are on, care about the actual discussions, and care about the rights of people to hold unpopular opinions.  On Reddit I try a bit to spread the truth about Voat's nice community ... but a small part of me almost doesn't want the broader Reddit population to know about it, for fear that Voat will become Reddit.  But Voat does need more contribution/contributors, so I'm still trying to ""get the Voat word out."""
Voat,3dejlk,well_golly,2,Thu Jul 16 02:39:52 2015 UTC,"I find it odd that so many Redditors just assume (without even bothering to go look around at Voat) that Voat is where the ""Baddies"" went   It's not that odd considering there's a definite narrative being pushed of Voat being for the worst members of reddit to congregate.    It seems to have died down a little but there was a while when anytime Voat was mentioned there'd be a cluster of comments saying how it's full of trolls, doxxers, racists, sexists, nutjobs, pedophiles etc etc.    Any community is going to have it's ""undesirable"" members so to say there is absolutely none of the above would be foolish but there's certainly no more of it than you find on reddit or in society at large. The nice thing is if you aren't interested in a subject you don't have to subscribe to it and if it actively upsets you then you can block individual subs (not that I've seen any hate subs on Voats front page) - As far as CP goes, from the start the owners have been clear they will not allow illegal content so as long as the users, mods and admins are doing their jobs that should never be there."

Voat still has it's place, but people who consider FPH has the Voat posterchild have to be looking at actions like this as hypocritical."
Voat,3djjlu,TheOfficialNoop,0,Thu Jul 16 22:53:39 2015 UTC,That's because you were suggesting that hamplanets were actually decent human beings. You will get banned if you say stupid shit.

Voat,3djjlu,thanos,-3,Fri Jul 17 00:13:25 2015 UTC,"Yes, I understand this. Which brings me back to my point about it being ironic and amusing that FPH were BAWWWing about mahfreespeech while banning people over non-griefer replies.  But apparently banning non-troll replies doesn't constitute as being anti-freespeech or it would have to be ironic, and in turn would mean you are the person who doesn't understand the definition of irony."
Voat,3djjlu,thanos,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:25:25 2015 UTC,"You don't seem to understand the difference between maintaining free speech at the site admin level and at the subverse moderator level. FPH never claimed to uphold free speech, while the reddit admins did. In fact the FPH mods freely admit that they won't  tolerate any dissenting opinions. The whole point of subverses is that you can make whatever rules you want in them. It seems to me you're just mad that you got banned."
Voat,3djjlu,WillyWeStack,-6,Fri Jul 17 00:34:01 2015 UTC,I understand this and don't disagree. Regardless   They BAWWWed over being banned Then they Banned   These two things are amusing as they are ironic. Nice attempt to derail these facts with fee fees.
Voat,3djjlu,GreyFoxSolid,2,Fri Jul 17 00:38:02 2015 UTC,"You sound like a 2 year old. It was a big deal because Reddit claimed to stand for free speech They've never claimed that and have always banned people. That's not ironic, you're an idiot."

Voat,3df8jo,alex_leishman,2,Wed Jul 15 20:22:15 2015 UTC,"Now you just discovered the source of the ddos.  If you are a company like reddit that doesn't turn a real profit, everyone of your relationships is based on the idea that the site is growing and will have profitable days in it's future.  Reddit went from 9th in the world to 33.  That's a huge change in relevance.  To put that in perspective 25 is an online shopping cart that I've never heard of called Tsmall.  It's getting the same traffic and selling people stuff and reddit with less traffic is putting up an add that 1 in 10,000 will click on."

Voat,3dfpft,chansee,2,Thu Jul 16 01:52:28 2015 UTC,They are two websites on the internet that link to other websites on the internet. Just because they are competitors doesn't mean users can't enjoy both.

Voat,3d2hgm,JadelyJade,26,Mon Jul 13 00:14:15 2015 UTC,"Who the hell keeps DDoS-ing Voat?! Seriously, it's baffling. Who keeps taking the time to do this?!  It certainly isn't anyone working for, or directly affiliated with, Reddit. Can you imagine the fallout if it were discovered that Reddit was actively working to disable a competitor? Even among the large swathe of Redditors who've never been to Voat, and who dismiss it as some kind of troll haven, that would not go over well.  It could be someone you might describe as an ""SJW"". Voat, rather unfortunately, is associated by many people with FPH, and Voat users tend to be opposed to militant ""social justice"" rhetoric. However, this seems oddly unlikely. Wouldn't those people just kind of stay in the darker corners of Tumblr and make fun of it, rather than actively trying to DDoS the site?"
Voat,3d2hgm,photonasty,21,Mon Jul 13 06:45:45 2015 UTC,It's probably just someone butthurt about it existing because they lack the ability to have made Voat themselves. All the SJW and Reddit theories are fairly unlikely.  My pie in the sky pretty unlikely but lets have a stab at it conspiracy theory is that it probably has some mod/s from Reddit involved because Voat is a threat to their power base and they are more likely to have the free time and motivation to do it.  You'll never prove anything though because a DDOS can simply be purchased these days.
Voat,3d2hgm,brokenskill,12,Mon Jul 13 07:33:59 2015 UTC,"A Reddit mod makes a lot of sense. Someone who has a sense of attachment to reddit and symaltaneously hates the idea of their sister subverse taking over when Reddit falls  Imagine being a top mod of /r/hacking and knowing that soon /v/hacking will be the new hangout and you won't be a mod there.  To my understanding, a DDOS is cheap and easy to buy these days"
Voat,3d2hgm,youshouldreadthem,3,Mon Jul 13 10:27:17 2015 UTC,"It could be a disgruntled mod from somewhere batshit like SRS or something. While I think Reddit's admins are both too professional, and too busy right now, to do something stupid like DDoS Voat, who knows about the powermods."
Voat,3d2hgm,photonasty,7,Mon Jul 13 17:45:35 2015 UTC,"My opinion: Voat makes it harder for downvote brigades, new accounts have to be around and contribute for a bit before they can downvote anything.   There might be a sub or two here who might tend to brigade things that hurt their fee-fees simply because they exist (and get away with it because the admins don't care). Since they can't brigade Voat, DDOS is about the only effect they can have."
Voat,3d2hgm,Absentfriends,4,Mon Jul 13 13:36:33 2015 UTC,"From what I understand, SRS is known for frequent brigading. However, I do not know the details of that, nor do I care to. Those people are kind of nuts, from what I've seen, so I stay away from that place.  Maybe SRS is secretly coordinating a DDoS attack. Who even knows. Part of me figures they're too busy, sensible, etc. to bother with such a thing, but people can be crazy sometimes. If someone genuinely feels that the content on Voat is offensive, wrong, and shouldn't exist, they could perhaps feel like they're doing the right thing by disabling the site."
Voat,3d2hgm,photonasty,2,Mon Jul 13 17:47:38 2015 UTC,"If it were SRS, I doubt they'd keep their actions quiet. They have too much hubris for that."

Voat,3d2hgm,s0ft_,12,Mon Jul 13 11:32:20 2015 UTC,Cue bono?  Remember that when reddit was first starting out it used bots and sockpuppets to post comments to make it seem like there were more users. I don't think a DDOS is beneath some of the reddit employees/founders.
Voat,3d2hgm,MaunaLoona,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:17:45 2015 UTC,"I actually don't have much of a problem with Reddit's founders faking activity in the very early days of the site. That's actually pretty routine for a new social media site, and it really just provides some content to get things started. Surely, Reddit's employees are too busy, and not batshit crazy enough, to DDoS their competitors... right?"
Voat,3d2hgm,photonasty,5,Mon Jul 13 17:48:40 2015 UTC,Or someone's just bored.
Voat,3d2hgm,ThirdEyedea,6,Mon Jul 13 08:04:56 2015 UTC,Have you even seen the way tumblr tries to raid 4chan? Or how tumblrinas will raid tumblr and blame it on 4chan just to make 4chan look bad?
Voat,3d2hgm,photonasty,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:59:03 2015 UTC,"I'm not actually familiar with that, although unfortunately, I don't doubt it. While I'm rather active on Tumblr, I've meticulously screened out the SJW bullshit over the last few years, so I rarely see anything like that on my dashboard."
Voat,3d2hgm,wuzizname,2,Mon Jul 13 17:49:32 2015 UTC,Trolls who know how much of a hard time the Admins have gone through to keep up with the massive influx of traffic maybe?  You have to give those guys credit where credit is due for keeping the site up through all this. Even keeping it up through multiple heavy ddos attacks.
Voat,3d2hgm,SubmittedToDigg,9,Mon Jul 13 16:59:14 2015 UTC,"I think it's odd that when it went down there was a flurry of comments on that thread, but 45 minutes after it's up and no one comments on this one? Seems like people were ready to call out Voat being down."

Voat,3d2hgm,MaunaLoona,6,Mon Jul 13 06:08:50 2015 UTC,From what I've seen of SJWs they are incompetent at everything they do. Do you really think one of them could have pulled off a DDOS? I doubt it.

Voat,3d6wq2,Jahadaz,2,Tue Jul 14 03:37:28 2015 UTC,How is deleting a sub that is trying to game the upvote system censorship? I understand the sentiment but people need to stop throwing that word around willy-nilly.
Voat,3d6wq2,2leaf,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:31:50 2015 UTC,"They put this in their sidebar   It is obvious that the Voat Admins do not truly care about how you gain your CCP, as messages from them often encourage you to gain easy points by commenting in /v/introductions. The reason for this is that the Admins want all new users to conform to Voat. Here at /v/downvoat we encourage our users to force Voat to conform to us. Post whatever content you want, and be yourself. Don't let others tell define voat for you, mold the culture yourself."
Voat,3d6wq2,2leaf,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:10:45 2015 UTC,"They can put whatever they like in the sidebar, but they aren't fooling anybody.  Their ""admins tell us to post in introductions so they don't care"" logic is retarded. They recommend introductions because it's a catch-all, fitting sub for new users, which are often the ones hitting the limit."
Voat,3d6wq2,GeckoInSuit,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:53:59 2015 UTC,"Theres a difference between censoring ideas and discussion and preventing abuse on the system thats set in place. The ccp is set for a reason and the option to bypass it in manipulative ways other than participating in the site to gain it like you should, should be taken away."
Voat,3d6wq2,Jahadaz,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:34:37 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the ccp shouldn't exist.  They want active users and I understand that.  It is a self destructive act for site to have a point system.  It makes people think they can ""win"" the internet."
Voat,3d6wq2,GeckoInSuit,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:35:11 2015 UTC,"I think its a good idea, especially with how many redditors are migrating to voat. The ccp (if we use it right and dont abuse it) will allow many users to get an idea of how the community works. Otherwise the masses of former reddit users would assume its a carbon copy of reddit and continue to downvoat ideas that disagree with them and constant cercle jerk, pun shit."
Voat,3d6wq2,Jahadaz,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:59:15 2015 UTC,"""Carbon copy"", if you look at downvoat, someone literally complained that it was a bad subreddit.      Here's an idea, eliminate downvoating all together.  Upvoates are fine but downvoates don't exist.  Wonder how that would go?"
Voat,3d6wq2,GeckoInSuit,2,Wed Jul 15 16:47:13 2015 UTC,Eh in my opinion it wouldnt work. Downvoating is a useful tool unless used inappropriately like everything else
Voat,3d6wq2,Jahadaz,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:54:09 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if I can get behind that.  How is it a useful tool?  You and I both know there is a metric f***ton of terrible internet posts out there, but how does downvoating them fix it?"
Voat,3d6wq2,GeckoInSuit,2,Wed Jul 15 19:59:03 2015 UTC,"Honestly idk. Usually I have strong beliefs and reasons but I have no idea why it should stay, but all I know is that I would enjoy the site a lot worse if it was taken away. Sure downvoating horrible content doesnt do much, but having that little way of showing that I disapprove instead of it getting mindless upvoats is what I like. Maybe it would be better off tho!"

Voat,3d3rlx,JadelyJade,3,Mon Jul 13 07:57:45 2015 UTC,"Ugh, my bad. That's got to be tough to mitigate. It seems like I can land on the ""we are redirecting you"" page, which seems weird, since that should be the DDoS protection.  But whatever is doing it is probably bypassing it due to the scale of the attack."
Voat,3d3rlx,justcool393,2,Mon Jul 13 07:59:11 2015 UTC,"Or maybe they're upping their game, taking out the site with requests for that one static html page alone."

Voat,3d3rlx,justcool393,2,Mon Jul 13 08:13:06 2015 UTC,They may be proactively finding ways of circumventing their DDoS protection.

It appeared as a term for a pagan idol in trial transcripts of the Inquisition of the Knights Templar in the early 14th century.

Voat,3d28pt,l23r,-4,Mon Jul 13 14:18:42 2015 UTC,I suspect higher up than reddit management. Reddit sucks because it's being manipulated.

Voat,3cwlxh,the_loneliest_noodle,7,Sat Jul 11 12:02:32 2015 UTC,Great point.
Voat,3cwlxh,kiwikku,2,Sat Jul 11 16:05:27 2015 UTC,"It should be done when it's causing pain. I mod /v/nostupidquestions and asked the mods of AskVoat and ELI5 if they were having problems with unwanted questions. Both said they were and gently directed certain questions to NSQ in their sidebar. NSQ is now getting a lot more submissions and those subs can focus their content. Win-win. As they get bigger I suspect they'll want to restrict questions even further and send even more people our way. Great.  It should be done like that. When it's fixing a problem. Not because we like shiny new toys.  /v/NBA is making the decision not to link to team subs for exactly this reason. The mod doesn't think the sub is big enough to help support all of those communities, he doesn't want /v/NBA getting fragmented."
Voat,3cwlxh,18andover,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:10:01 2015 UTC,"When appropriate and the community is big enough, sure, pruning might be needed. But people seem to just be making their old favorites from reddit, not realizing or caring that their parent community is sub-1000 members. The reason I keep coming back to reddit today is because there just isn't enough content on the existing more known subverses. Telling people they have to navigate subverses where there is no community yet is community suicide.   It's like popular youtube channels. Sure if you get huge you can make sub-channels, but it's always a big question of ""is it a good idea to be splitting my fan-base?"""
Voat,3cwlxh,spyglasses,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:42:25 2015 UTC,"Smaller is good for those getting in on the ground and wanting to become something that it is too late to do on reddit.

Voat,3cuiwk,delqhic,13,Fri Jul 10 21:57:56 2015 UTC,Is that it for Voat or what?

Voat,3cuiwk,GetMeOffReddit,14,Sat Jul 11 00:24:40 2015 UTC,I am not so sure. This is a pretty big move and at least shows they are listening to their members. Bringing back an OG will help too. Voat is just down so often I can't even enjoy it (yet)  I do like the idea of being on both sites & hopefully in the future Voat gets a mobile app (where I do the majority of my reddit viewing)

Voat,3cuiwk,oneUnit,0,Sat Jul 11 19:44:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks for letting me know your opinion. I use reddit because of the community on some subreddits, which is the exact same reason I use voat and 4chan and 8chan and tumblr and facebook and twitter and youtube. You get the picture.   I think Reddit is heading in a bad direction, I'm fairly vocal about my opinion on the subject. But I'll use whatever resources I want to in order to get in contact with people I find interesting.   But again, thank you for sharing your opinion on my behavior and letting me know that you're paying close attention to my motivations and decisions in life. It was quite an interesting read."

Voat,3cuiwk,Maxcactus,2,Sat Jul 11 01:28:13 2015 UTC,Besides this mob action has to be the best thing that could have happened for this subreddit. What was traffic like a month ago except for people making fun of its poor functionality?

Voat,3cuiwk,ForAFewShekelsMore__,2,Sat Jul 11 00:31:42 2015 UTC,They'll make another monumental fuck-up within the fortnight. You could set your watch to reddit admin drama and bullshit.  I bet the very next thing they do is announce another round of ''transarency'' like fucking Gorbachev announcing Perestroika and Glasnost.

Voat,3cvv0s,Circus_Hobo,3,Sat Jul 11 05:14:05 2015 UTC,This isn't the first time someone has said this on both Reddit and Voat. I'm usually out of the loop when it comes to these kinds of things. It definitely makes me wonder though if this really is the case.
Voat,3cvv0s,MarktheFather,2,Sun Jul 12 17:26:29 2015 UTC,"I don't know or care what she attempted to do to Reddit.  I was pretty out of the loop when it came to her being CEO and changes she was planning, plus it didn't affect me. Honestly, I can't say for sure, whether she was a scapegoat or not. But I would guess, yes."
Voat,3cvv0s,Unrelentingpisstrain,2,Sun Jul 12 03:45:09 2015 UTC,"I've seen some shady shit occur in companies, and this is exactly what they would do.  Hire some interim CEO to do some fucked up shit, then move on to the next CEO every 8-12 months.  Have them take all the blame, while in reality it's the board's decision and they want to throw someone under the bus.  You can tell this is what happened, because Reddit now has the old CEO back in charge, but he won't reverse any of the ""fuck ups"" that were made.  It was all deliberate.      In this case, to add fuel to the fire, how about they select a minority woman, so that way when shit hits the fan they can decry sexism and racism as a bonus.  Totally planned.  Abandon ship.  #voat.co"
Voat,3cvv0s,ANGRY_BEES,2,Sun Jul 12 19:02:42 2015 UTC,"No. Everyone is saying that she was, however the changes Ellen Pao has made don't even scratch the surface of the unpopular changes that reddit wants to make.  Banning fatpeoplehate and firing one chick? Who gives a damn?  In fact, a better CEO could have done both those things without alienating the userbase in the process. Ellen Pao just has terrible people skills, which is what happens when your only two modes of human interaction are looking down your nose at people and suing them."
Voat,3cvv0s,Unrelentingpisstrain,2,Sat Jul 11 16:35:57 2015 UTC,"The person Ellen Pao fired, Victoria Taylor, was important, I think for AMAs. Anyone who frequently visits that sub would be concerned, but to people who don't, it's just another person. I can sympathize with that sub but I'll never really know how important Victoria was.

Voat,3cxeuk,2leaf,-2,Sun Jul 12 02:35:49 2015 UTC,"They deleted my thread about comparison between Reddit and Voat, because of the rule 8 (which is don't post about Reddit), but later they accepted many Reddit related submits (threads) there. It's a double standard. Also they deleted another thread of my relative about the problem with their CAPTCHA, which makes people from China and other places not able to participate.  Let's have better news board."
Voat,3cxeuk,nomerasques,3,Sun Jul 12 08:20:30 2015 UTC,"The subverse is for NEWS. You post links to news. you discuss those news in the comments.  It's not for posting your own opinions about reddit vs voat. You have /v/meanwhileonreddit for that, for example.  And you have voatdev for the captcha problem.  The other reddit submits where links to external NEWS articles about reddit.  Not even meta about news is allowed, you have i think is newsmeta for that.  If you want to discuss without posting a link to a news article, try politics maybe, or any other sub.  I think its pretty clear right?  I go to /v/news to browse for news, not for opinions about reddit vs voat or captcha problems of your relative (unless the BBC does an article about it, then post it)"
Voat,3cxeuk,nomerasques,-1,Sun Jul 12 16:09:44 2015 UTC,"What about the rule 8? So many people post about Reddit in v/news and no problem. I post only once and AT ONCE -- ""RULE 8! DELETED"".  Please, think objectively and welcome to the new v: v/freenews, where we will try to make it almost without rules and limits as much as possible! :)"
Voat,3cxeuk,nomerasques,2,Sun Jul 12 16:20:44 2015 UTC,"OK, your submission ""about comparison between Reddit and Voat"" was a news article posted where? Post it so we can see it.  As I said, your ""many people post about Reddit"" are links to NEWS ARTICLES that happen to talk about reddit (The PAO thing lately).

This shows bad moderation, at least and, if we imply my case -- double standard. I know many of you are young guys and don't care so much about the matters like these, but... just think for a while that they're not perfect."
Voat,3cxeuk,2leaf,2,Sun Jul 12 16:55:26 2015 UTC,"I remember your submission. It was not a news article link. You said it yourself, it was a link to a forum post, so NOT NEWS.  The other posts you mention where not ""about reddit"" they are posts to NEWS related to reddit events.  Listen, if you are in a book club, you want to see books, if someone says ""I have this great magazine about reddit here"" fine, go show it in some magazine club.  If I say ""I have this BOOK about reddit"" then it's fine, because it's a BOOK. Get it?   I know many of you are young guys   I am 52   and don't care so much about the matters like these   Yeah, that's why I keep replying to you to set things straight.   just think for a while that they're not perfect.

Voat,3ctcgk,moeOkay,3,Fri Jul 10 20:29:50 2015 UTC,To add to this a lot of reddit mods took subverses at Voat.  Voat has been handing many of those subverses to people who requested them as more people joined Voat.

Voat,3ctcgk,18andover,3,Sat Jul 11 09:10:21 2015 UTC,I created SEVERAL subverses that seem to not exist anymore.  /v/TWC  /v/TimeWarner  /v/TimerWarnerCable  /v/Korra  Now all of them seem to be non-existent.
Voat,3ctcgk,AnotherSmegHead,7,Fri Jul 10 21:13:37 2015 UTC,You have 24 hours to make a post or the subverse is deleted.  If you created them while the site kept going down they would most likely go away during that time.

Voat,3crw6s,geekygirl23,-1,Fri Jul 10 07:59:41 2015 UTC,"I have been wanting to say this for a long time.  Making a community platform that asks people to vote on content then getting pissed off when people use it how it was built is stupid. Asking your twitter followers to go vote on your submission to some subreddit / subverse is a normal behavior and should not be discouraged. This is extra true for personal friends.  As for brigading, brigading is a word that should have never been invented in this context. Again, users are punished for using this site how it was intended.   You don't even have to type a url to share another subreddit or subverse. I like /r/cake. See? The mods and later the admins getting butthurt because one sub links to another on this shared space with any or no goal in mind is ludicrous. Of course the cake haters would downvote cake related stuff, they could do it already! Not only can you not stop their behavior it would be foolish to ask people not to downvote whatever the hell they want and expect them to give a shit. What does putting ""no brigading!"" in the sidebar accomplish? Not a damn thing."

Voat,3cpnlw,HiVOAT,15,Thu Jul 9 19:44:30 2015 UTC,FUCK shadowbans. Incredibly frustrating.

Voat,3cpnlw,Birdyer,3,Fri Jul 10 03:01:01 2015 UTC,"One easy trick is to go to your username page (ie: mine is https://www.reddit.com/u/m-p-3), copy the URL and try to open that same URL in Private Browsing/Incognito mode (which will temporarily mark you as logged out). If you see Page not found, you're most likely shadowbanned.  I guess you could make a script online that checks if your username page is fine or saying page not found once per day, and get an email if that is the case. Something like that could be done using a Google Apps Script, without requiring setting up a server yourself, etc."

When used against non advertisers, it's basically being used as a tool to fuck with you.   When Reddit admin posted that shit about being sorry, you can best believe they're not. Some of the shitty stuff they've done has gone on for years with lots of complaints, so it's not like they suddenly found out they're pissing off users.   They just never gave a fuck about the userbase, it's all about moderators and subreddits. The gold on reddit is the comment system and the comments, and they've never got that.   They think they're going to be another Facebook, well they don't realize most of the folks are here for the commenting.  I can go find a Facebook group for any subject that can be found as a subreddit on Reddit. I'm only subscribed to one (GMOLOL). Facebook groups are often  ban heavy, circlejerking, echo chambers, sound familiar?"

Voat,3cpnlw,relish-tranya,3,Fri Jul 10 01:29:40 2015 UTC,It wouldn't be so bad if you received a message stating you've been shadowbanned. That way you can appeal it as soon as you can to get your account back (if you really wanted it). I was shadowbanned before and it took me almost a week when a mod from a small sub told me I was shadowbanned.
Voat,3cpnlw,CreepingMan_,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:58:26 2015 UTC,How do mods see it? Are you only shadow banned from subs or can you be shadow banned from reddit in general?

A reddit clone that users are going to due to a few reasons (speculation):  People don't like the direction reddit is going with their decisions and policy changes.   They don't like the safe space idea.   They dislike the community here (a lot of group think and hive mind ideals), and want to be around people who are more open minded, which seems like quite a few people moving over.   Those are a few I can think of."
Voat,3cnz2j,piitza,15,Thu Jul 9 15:19:34 2015 UTC,"One more reason. It's a much smaller community (for the moment) meaning you get more original content, genuine discussion, and the front page isn't dominated by a small group of elite super posters.  It's like reddit about 5 years ago.  Much smaller and higher quality."

Voat,3cnz2j,ooogr2i8,-2,Thu Jul 9 23:00:29 2015 UTC,Original content? Almost everything on /v/pics and funny are shitty memes straight from Reddit top all. Non of it is original.

Voat,3cnz2j,KeenBlade,2,Thu Jul 9 22:03:23 2015 UTC,Most default or popular subs most of the time you don't see an unpopular opinion with a positive number of upvotes. You either agree with the majority or don't reply.
Voat,3cnz2j,piitza,3,Fri Jul 10 00:01:30 2015 UTC,"They dislike the community here (a lot of group think and hive mind ideals), and want to be around people who are more open minded, which seems like quite a few people moving over.    That's one I can't really reason with. Over at Voat, I see a lot of comments/threads make reference to Ellen Pao in a very negative light, comments on how Voat is better than Reddit, etc and them all being upvoted with no downvotes—it's pretty circlejerky over there. At least over here it's a healthy mix of people who don't care about Pao and people who call her the second coming of Hitler. I don't sub to subreddits where it gets too circlejerky so the only reddit-wide topic I see on my front page is the recent blackout/bad admins/ceo/whatever and its much more tame over here than there. I go to Voat simply because of its features (anonymous mode is amazing and needed), not because I don't like Reddit (being any kind of programmer here at Reddit is amazing. Tons of opportunity to ask for and give help to fellow developers)."

Voat,3cnz2j,piitza,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:23:39 2015 UTC,"Very true, but there are some places that it's really up in the air. I can only speak from personal, anecdotal evidence, but I really do like the web development subreddits here. There are a few blindly upvoted topics (PHP is bad, jQuery is bad, scrolljacking is bad, too much whitespace is dumb, etc), but for the most part I learn a lot from those subreddits.  But back on topic: People as a whole stick to trends (pop music, trendy clothes, popular political ideology, etc), but my initial point was that Voat is no better in that regard and shouldn't be advertised or glorified as such—it'll only disappoint people. Voat, in my opinion, should strive to be a better way to share and discuss news/information, which is why I LOVE anonymous mode. It's like a chan board (best idea sharing structure, in my opinion—anonymous and no way for your opinion to drown/censor others) + Reddit together."
Voat,3cnz2j,droctagonapus,2,Thu Jul 9 18:46:13 2015 UTC,"Nice! I am in a few niche subs with a smaller community which allows for great conversation and really no BS.   I'm on both. Seems like the equivalent of defaults here is better on voat, but with how big reddit is, you can find communities that aren't touched by the whole reddit safe space Pao BS that seems evident in larger subs. Both are good sites, and like everything, you get what you want out of it."
Voat,3cnz2j,piitza,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:37:57 2015 UTC,"I'm with you :) I like both, I see a lot of different thinking on Voat subverses, but I get the communities I love here (so far). I'd like to see Voat get a shot, though, since it is probably the most solid chance of more diversity in the social-link-aggregator market that Reddit currently dominates."

Voat,3cnz2j,piitza,2,Thu Jul 9 17:24:15 2015 UTC,It won't. It is already much like reddit used to be. The subreddit/subverse idea is a pretty strong protection against that.

Voat,3cmnx0,no_frill,4,Thu Jul 9 02:27:31 2015 UTC,what is it for? I cant read it and see it >.<
Voat,3cmnx0,Mechator_Rex,5,Thu Jul 9 09:33:00 2015 UTC,"it's a subverse of moderators, just posting nonsense and playing around with the possibilities of modding their subverses"
Voat,3cmnx0,dreikelvin,2,Thu Jul 9 11:42:16 2015 UTC,Oh hey I mod (along with a bunch of others) there. I have been playing around seeing what I can and can't make spin. Usually when I fail the entire sub goes into a giant spinning spiral of doom.... so really it is a win/win.
Voat,3cmnx0,Minyaden,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:58:05 2015 UTC,This spinning is my favourite part.  Keep up the good work.  I have done a few tweaks myself.
Voat,3cmnx0,dreikelvin,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:58:39 2015 UTC,it is awesome.  I am glad I deactivated user styling though ;)
