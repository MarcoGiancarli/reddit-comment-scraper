dykesgonemild,3e0m2l,micro-me,11,Tue Jul 21 01:12:29 2015 UTC,The last one is the absolute best. I say screw the people who liked your haircut before. You look much happier and more comfortable in your own skin with the short hair. How you feel is the most important factor!
dykesgonemild,3e0m2l,OssumyPossumy,2,Tue Jul 21 02:47:11 2015 UTC,Thank you :) It is hard to feel confident when people keep bringing me down with their comments!

My wife dislikes my short hair, but screw it, I feel comfortable with it so she just has to deal with it. She has much shorter, close-cropped hair, so I tell her that if she likes long hair so much she can grow hers :p"

Like you said, we should do what we want ourselves and  I need to remember I can't please everyone. I feel more comfortable with short hair as well... yet it hasn't gotten the greatest reception. That's what made me feel less confident in the cut. Thanks :)"

dykesgonemild,3cujul,nevernudefoundation,9,Fri Jul 10 22:04:50 2015 UTC,Gf of two years broke up with me bc she wasn't attracted to me anymore.
dykesgonemild,3cujul,suzanneisgek,7,Fri Jul 10 22:05:18 2015 UTC,"That's a really unfair thing to say when you break up with someone. Even if you feel less attracted to someone I can't believe that's the reason you break up, especially after two years. But that's just my opinion.  Also my opinion: I think you're super cute!"
dykesgonemild,3cujul,suzanneisgek,7,Fri Jul 10 23:04:21 2015 UTC,I agree.  It came out of the blue.  We went out and she was being extremely flirtatious with a girl.  I called her out and she said I can go home by myself.  The next morning I asked if she could come home bc I missed her.  She did and said she was not attracted or in love with me anymore.  This was after I paid for everything for two years.  I thought we are in it for the long haul so I had no problem taking care of her for two years.  To say the least I learned my lesson.
dykesgonemild,3cujul,suzanneisgek,6,Sat Jul 11 00:01:33 2015 UTC,"I'm really sorry to hear that. I hear what you're saying about learning your lesson, I just hope that this experience doesn't diminish your giving nature too much. You sound sweet and generous and it would be a shame if a bad experience takes that away from you.  I'm just trying to imagine how you must feel so correct me please if I'm wrong but I hope you don't feel too bad about the last two years. Hindsight is 20/20. You did what you thought was right at those moments.  I hope I'm making some sense for you.   xoxo Suzanne"
dykesgonemild,3cujul,suzanneisgek,3,Sat Jul 11 00:34:37 2015 UTC,Yes you're right.  I just shouldn't give 100%.  If they want to be with me then they should able they can provide for me the same way I can provide for then.  I feel like I was taken advantage of.  You're sweet though.  Thank you :)
dykesgonemild,3cujul,flyrobotfly,2,Sat Jul 11 00:36:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's what I was alluding to. Now that you're broken up you're going to think of the things you did for her and how they now seem like a waste. This can range from financial aide to simply surprising her with a nice dinner for example. In my experience it's the nice things you did most recently before you broke up that hurt the most. Or you start thinking about the last time you had sex and you think about that the other was already thinking about breaking up with you. Those are the things that make my stomach sink when I think of them, feel so incredibly painful and come to me just a few seconds before I was going to fall asleep and waking me right back up. Those are the moments that make me feel like a idiot when I think back on them.  I hope you won't experience those feelings. You'll probably do though but just know you aren't the only one.   xoxo"

dykesgonemild,3c583l,MissValeska,7,Wed Jul 8 02:02:58 2015 UTC,"Hi :) Thanks for the double compliments <HuGGzz>  As for my story, the biggest part is that it took me 49 years to completely realize/discover my true gender identity. I was born in a male body, but ever since the age of around 7 (when I first saw what a very cheeky little girl had in her pants) I knew that there was something very, very wrong with my body. That was way back in the days when no one talked about such things in UK where I was born. Because of the sense of shame and disgust that developed I had a lot of difficulty relating to girls as I grew older, not that I didn't like them but because I was terrified of having to reveal the nasty dangly thing between my legs :( At the same time I had absolutely no interest whatsoever in guys.  This situation continued without improvement for all of my adult life, including a conventional marriage to a very dominant , aggressive woman. She was only interested in 'plain vanilla' sex and I was terrified of conventional male/female penetrative sex. I tried to do my best, but she didn't appreciate my efforts. Along with having several affairs during our time together she further destroyed my self confidence by frequently accusing me of being impotent or gay. I sadly spent far too much time with her, but she was also highly manipulative and managed to keep me locked into the relationship.  When she finally decided that she was done with me and moved on to other things I was able to begin the long, slow process of rebuilding my sense of self and also of finding answers to my long held, deeply buried questions about my identity. At some stage a very good friend suggested that I look into the topic of transexuality/transgender. What I discovered totally changed my life! I finally realized that I was, in fact, truly female. I have been living fully as a woman since 2006 and am completely accepted by everyone as just that.  As part of the learning process in my new identity I was also able to very honestly examine my true sexual preferences, even to the point of some experimentation. I fairly quickly concluded that I am very solidly attracted to women exclusively in every way. I think women are the most gorgeous creatures on earth and I can only hope that one day I will meet someone that I can hold, cherish and love."
dykesgonemild,3c583l,MissValeska,4,Wed Jul 8 03:03:00 2015 UTC,"Reading your story is inspiring! I wish you much joy, peace and love in the future! Edit: Your hair rocks!"
