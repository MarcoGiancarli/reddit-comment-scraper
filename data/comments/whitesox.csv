whitesox,3e3vov,knightni73,7,Tue Jul 21 19:27:01 2015 UTC,Article is spot on... unfortunately.
whitesox,3e3vov,PatrickBateman1,6,Tue Jul 21 19:54:32 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree with this. The entire organization needs to be addressed. There's something to say about us when we haven't developed a good hitter in years. The management just keeps saying that Sox fans need to be patient and loyal, but it's tough when we haven't been to the post season in 7 years."
whitesox,3e3vov,jnez50,4,Tue Jul 21 21:07:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree 100%. It's frustrating when they get pissed that fans don't come out, but how can they blame them with the disappointment after disappointment they field?! I don't live in Chicago atm, but if I was home I imagine I wouldn't go out of my way to go see them more than a few times unless the tickets were free or Sale was pitching.  I wish Reinsdorf would clean house and start poaching from quality organizations like St. Louis and the Giants. Hell, the Red Sox are hardcore underperforming but they've got quite a few rings recently. It couldn't have been all Theo Epstein.   It's a head scratcher why Reinsdorf has held the staff together for as long as he has, considering how solidly built the Bulls are down the street, and how quick he was to fire Thibbs when they underperformed. He must really like some of those guys as friends, or have something else seriously clouding his thoughts."
whitesox,3e3vov,unbridled_enthusiasm,7,Tue Jul 21 21:29:09 2015 UTC,"Reinsdorf cares more about the White Sox than Bulls, if you can believe it. You can thank GarPax for the Bulls responsive management. I think Reinsdorf might be too personally close with Kenny Williams, because Kenny should have been released when Rick Hahn took his job.  Either way, I'm aiming to attend 20+ games this season. Love this team."
whitesox,3e3vov,ACSimeon,4,Tue Jul 21 22:02:27 2015 UTC,↑ True Sox fan here. Gotta agree Kenny should not still be around and I think he's continuing to have a strong influence on our drafts and scouting efforts.
whitesox,3e3vov,Cheeky_buggah,4,Tue Jul 21 22:19:54 2015 UTC,"nice! I used to do 10+ a season, but I've been stuck on the east coast, so it's been a couple years since I've been unfortunately."
whitesox,3e3vov,unbridled_enthusiasm,2,Tue Jul 21 22:48:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and I live in Skokie. It's definitely fanaticism lol."
whitesox,3e3vov,ACSimeon,4,Tue Jul 21 22:50:38 2015 UTC,Gonna be tough to win when Kenny is still and charge. We're hoping to catch lightning in a bottle.  Also... the best infield position player we've developed from a somewhat young age in the last 10 years or so (maybe more)... Gordon Beckham. Let that sink in. Don't think we've developed any outfielders either come to think of it.
whitesox,3e5phv,aviddemon,2,Wed Jul 22 03:55:25 2015 UTC,"I don't think you can assume that he'd be hitting the same way with us.  Cubs are hitting like crazy this year, White Sox are the opposite of that. I know it's not sabermetrics but I have to believe bringing a rookie up in a good situation vs a bad one helps."
whitesox,3e5phv,jackarroo,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:19:16 2015 UTC,He'd have turned into Ron Karkovice 2.0 with this franchise's track record of developing major league caliber bats.

whitesox,3e3wdy,ElTunaGrande,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:31:17 2015 UTC,3pm is probably good. They open the bar 2 hours before game time but there will probably be a good amount of people waiting in line at that point. Note that if you don't get the lower tables you can always pay $15 for spots at the tables up top.
whitesox,3e3wdy,SlagginOff,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:55:52 2015 UTC,Yeah. Did that once and the was told 5 minutes before first pitch that they messed up and had booked a group for those top seats. Ended up getting screwed. Might try again though.

whitesox,3e4pwk,arsesox,4,Wed Jul 22 00:01:36 2015 UTC,Lol for real maybe if he wasn't garbage he would be called up.
whitesox,3e4pwk,callmeroo,3,Wed Jul 22 00:30:25 2015 UTC,"Everyone seems to forget that he's still only 24. Not young by any means, but still younger than Saladino (who wasn't exactly mashing in AAA this year). I'll label him a bust when/if he is called up to Chicago and sucks with the major league team."
whitesox,3e4pwk,AnniesBoobzz,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:13:22 2015 UTC,"If last year was a washout because of injuries, this is the full season Davidson needs at AAA. He might just be the kind of guy that needs time to adjust.   That's fine, but the Sox might not have the patience for on-the-job training. The fans certainly don't.   The Sox have a guy at second base right now who bombed his first trip through AAA and struggling to find his level now. Instead of having patience with a guy who adjusted just fine with experience at AAA, fans are clamoring for another guy who might not ever be able to play the position.   That's the struggle to see how Davidson's timeline fits into the Sox's window of expectations."
whitesox,3e4pwk,ChrisPummer,2,Wed Jul 22 01:21:57 2015 UTC,"Agreed. fans being impatient is normal, but some guys just take more time to develop than others, especially after being traded. I don't expect Davidson to ever be a .280+ hitter or anything, but I also think he will be able to provide the lineup with some much needed power at some point."
whitesox,3e4pwk,AnniesBoobzz,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:42:00 2015 UTC,"That's probably because he sucks.  At this point, Saladino is the stopgap and hope that Michalczewski continues to develop the way he has.  Davidson is basically org. filler now, unless he really finds his stroke.  The only good thing is that Reed also turned out to be a bag of hot garbage.  So a lose-lose trade for everybody.  I guess at least Davidson hasn't cost us any games at the MLB level."

Once you get close to Halsted and a little west, prices usually fall to $10 - $15.  Additionally, I believe you can park (for free) at the Buffalo Wings and Rings at 35th and Halsted and catch a shuttle to the park. You just have to grab some food there first.  Finally, S. Morgan doesn't have any residential parking permit restrictions, so you can park on the street for free, as long as you get there somewhat early. It's a 15 minutes walk or so to the park, but you can swing by some bars along the way."

Depressing or not, but it's probably because sox tickets are cheap and not many home fans come to the game anyway."

A lot of out of towners go to watch their team there to make their pilgrimage to Wrigley.  Especially the last few years when the Cubs were dogshit, there were games when there were more opposing fans in the seats than Cub fans."

whitesox,3e0ias,SlagginOff,8,Tue Jul 21 03:47:32 2015 UTC,"Royals fans have been the worst, probably because they're bandwagoners from 2014.  BUT the worst thing is probably the fake metal detectors.  I love the Cell though. Once you're in, it's the best stadium."
whitesox,3e0ias,ACSimeon,2,Tue Jul 21 12:56:50 2015 UTC,"I actually haven't attended any games against the Royals this year so I guess I don't have an updated opinion. In the past they've been fine, but maybe it's because there weren't so many of them."
whitesox,3e0ias,SlagginOff,5,Tue Jul 21 13:02:23 2015 UTC,"I can have fun with a smart Tigers fan. Royals fans will shit on our 10 year anniversary even though they didn't even win it last year, or any other year for the last 3 decades. Maybe it's just because I got to see us beat the Tigers when we've played them."
whitesox,3e0ias,ACSimeon,3,Tue Jul 21 13:06:54 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing with the Tigers fanbase, at least in Chicago - it reminds me of the Cubs fanbase. Some of them are my close friends and are good, knowledgeable baseball fans. The others (and unfortunately the most vocal) are meathead frat types who shit all over the Sox and call them trash despite the fact that their team is from Detroit.   edit: I suppose you could say this about pretty much any fanbase - maybe it just seems exaggerated because of the amount of Detroit transplants in Chicago."

That used to be what the Sox would draw, more or less, until they decided to become seemingly irrelevant in the first half of this decade. Two million would've been easily achieved this year had the Sox not pissed away their offseason good will with a putrid start in April. Killed all momentum going into the season with the casual fans that drive attendance numbers with their walkup ticket sales.  Sox almost had a stadium in Addison in the late 1980s until some good ol' Illinois politics managed to get them a sweetheart deal to stay on the Southside.  It's for the best that the Sox stay in the city. The stats show that a majority of the fanbase is here in the city proper while their only meaningful suburb presence is south of the city. The Cubs would be a far better fit for the burbs."

The odds of that are very slim. I'd rather us get good value for a couple guys and set ourselves up to make a run at it again next year. Sale , Abreu, and Rodon are better building blocks than most teams have, and I'd like to see us set up optimally for next year and build depth at the other positions. We have too many negative-WAR positions right now. Depth for next year is what we need, and that's what we can get with a good deadline deal. Contenders are looking for upgrades and would trade a couple average guys for samardzija and I'm all for a deal like that."

whitesox,3dypq3,k5therobot,3,Tue Jul 21 02:37:00 2015 UTC,"Samardzija probably won't bring back as big a return as some might hope, as teams will likely leverage the package the Sox sent to Oakland for him against them. Semien's been an average SS, Phegley admittedly above average at the plate - though that's on the heels of a BABIP well above what he ever put up in Chicago, Bassit's a sixth starter at best, and Rangel Ravelo, who while having a nice bat, is limited in value due to seemingly being stuck at 1B. And that was all for a full season of Samardzija, whereas anyone trading for him gets, at most, 3 1/2 months (assuming a deep playoff run).  The interesting thing here is how much faith the Sox front office puts in their player development staff. The team doesn't have a great record of player development, so at what value do they deem a return worth more than a pick in the compensation round? It should be interesting to watch."

I disagree with his methodology, and I'm glad we ""hold more territory"" than the Mets, Angels, and A's, but I think we're kidding ourselves by saying the Sox are on par with the Cubs in terms of share of the Chicago market and amount of national attention received.   I think my biggest gripe is that he claims to be ranking fans, and the methodology sounds like the only thing that matters is % of market showing up at games."
whitesox,3dzzk7,KaptainKielbasa,4,Tue Jul 21 12:21:21 2015 UTC,"seems about right. Our true colors show when we have a losing team. Cubs have been losing for a century and they fill 30,000 seats every single game every single season. We see an attendance drop after a bad week."

They pad their attendance with A) out of town fans and/or tourists who are coming to see their team play at Wrigley, a mecca for baseball fans (this is especially true when they play the Cardinals, Brewers, or Reds, I've seen the stadium as much as 75%+ for the other team for some gams) and B) tickets that are sold to brokers or scalpers that just go unused because they couldn't sell them on the secondary market.  Trust me, I saw Wrigley maybe 50-60% full plenty of times these last few years and they would announce attendance in the 38,000's.  The attendance thing is really all they have to hang on to so they'll pad that number any way possible.  The Sox, meanwhile, I am sure are purposefully cutting their attendance as much as possible.  Remember, if they don't draw a certain number of fans (I forget what it is exactly), they don't pay rent on U.S. Cellular Field to ISFA.  So I have been to plenty of Sox games in the last few years when the park is clearly 3/4 full and they still announce attendance at like 22,000 (about 1/2).  I have no doubt they're doing everything they can to cook the books and underreport their actual attendance figures."

If you're looking for the last position player that we developed and spent significant time here in Chicago and turned out to be not shit (looking at you Beckham, Brian Anderson, and Josh Fields), I think you have to go all the way back to Aaron Rowand, who was drafted in 1998 and debuted in 2001.

The Sox have shown a real knack for developing good pitchers out of deep sleepers; Quintana, Santiago, Bassitt... All were very late draft picks/minor league free agents the Sox identified and developed into quality MLB pitchers.  Meanwhile, I cannot remember even the last decent position player to come up through our minor league system... Chris Carter or Chris Young, I guess, if they count...  And even then, they're both really, really incomplete players.  I mean, we're probably talking Aaron Rowand as the last legitimate player who played at an All-Star level to be drafted and developed by the Sox.  He made his MLB debut what? 12 years ago.  Holy fuck balls.  The moral of this story is the Sox should do everything they can to trade pitching for MLB ready bats.

I bought my tickets from whitesox.com itself, they came in the mail everything fine, I go to the game, scan them, they don't go through, bear in mind I got there really early, plenty of rings left, then they say go to the ticket office and talk to them, we wait there for like 30 minutes, and the ticket people just stare at the tickets perplexed, and eventually just say fuck it, refund the tickets, and sell us crappy obstructed upper reserved.....and all the rings were gone by the time they fixed everything. Luckily I bought a few for me and my family from some royals fans but I was seriously pissed."
whitesox,3dydog,raj96,2,Mon Jul 20 20:36:52 2015 UTC,I chose not to wait for the ring and got the anniversary hat instead from the sports depot. I'll be wearing that hat more than the ring that would just sit on my shelf.
whitesox,3dydog,gooniehuh7,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:06:07 2015 UTC,"I put the ring on a necklace, it's definitely too big to wear on my fingers lol."
whitesox,3dydog,ACSimeon,2,Tue Jul 21 00:27:20 2015 UTC,It's definitely not too big as an engagement ring.
whitesox,3dydog,purplenightsky,2,Wed Jul 22 01:16:04 2015 UTC,I got a ring and so did my 2 friends.  They gave theirs away to some kids who wanted them. I must have missed the craziness you speak of.
whitesox,3dydog,Mrslinger85,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:12:11 2015 UTC,"Well it was meant to be for 21 and older as well but the amount of. Kids are that were holding like 3 would suggest otherwise. Attendance was only like 30,000 so I could see them going but I think they gave them to kids as well."
whitesox,3e0hyg,america_rex,7,Tue Jul 21 00:39:06 2015 UTC,If the Sox traded Sale I would legitimately take a break from the White Sox for a few years.
whitesox,3e0hyg,JROremus,8,Tue Jul 21 02:35:20 2015 UTC,"If the Sox get rid of Sale and Abreu, I would have no reason to watch/spend money on the team. I'm certain I'm not alone."
whitesox,3e0hyg,titomb345,2,Tue Jul 21 02:27:36 2015 UTC,"Nope, you aren't alone. They are essentially the only obvious bright side and selling point of this team and cannot go under any circumstances in the near (semi-far?) future.   I respectfully disagree with you, OP."
whitesox,3e0hyg,QEDomelets,-1,Tue Jul 21 02:41:01 2015 UTC,"A pitcher who throws every 5th day keeps you invested? Seager, Conforto, and Urias would be more exciting"
whitesox,3e0hyg,JROremus,4,Tue Jul 21 12:32:44 2015 UTC,"In your opinion.  Some people like seeing a dominating pitcher like Chris Sale go out and pitch. It isn't every day a Chris Sale type pitcher comes along.  The dodgers wouldn't do that trade anyway, so it isn't like it matters"
whitesox,3e0hyg,MustacheMark,0,Tue Jul 21 13:13:58 2015 UTC,You have a great point. Every day position players that are good are worth more than an every five day starter. I don't disagree with you but I don't like it either haha
whitesox,3e0hyg,mattfromchicago,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:20:02 2015 UTC,"Just trying to remember, when was the last time one of these mega-trades for a SP actually worked out for the team who dealt their ace?  Halladay, Cliff Lee, Sabathia, Greinke... All of them earned huge returns that really just fizzled.  I don't even know if any of them even came near to getting return on the deal.  That's just the nature of prospects, they're very fickle, even the very best and brightest don't pan out all the time."
whitesox,3e0hyg,ACSimeon,5,Wed Jul 22 06:54:25 2015 UTC,"We cannot trade Chris Sale, not unless he has terrible problems I do not know about. He is basically Randy Johnson without steroids, in that seeing Chris start is pretty much always worth the price of admission. He hasn't had a lot of major injuries, and I think he's going to stay healthy and productive long enough to make Cooperstown."
whitesox,3e0hyg,arsesox,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:28:24 2015 UTC,"Might need a little more out of the Sale deal, but I'm open to anything at this point if it makes us better. Honestly though with the new contracts we handed out we are fucked for at least 2 years"
whitesox,3e0hyg,NicCage420,2,Tue Jul 21 02:56:02 2015 UTC,"Sale's contract gives the Sox the option of their version of the Herschel Walker trade, if they so choose to go that route."
whitesox,3e0hyg,arsesox,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:41:37 2015 UTC,Can you explain im not familiar
whitesox,3e0hyg,NicCage420,2,Tue Jul 21 17:23:01 2015 UTC,"In the late 1980's, the Dallas Cowboys were in a bad spot. They only had a couple good players, and felt the only real bargaining chip they had was star running back Herschel Walker. He was traded by the Cowboys to the Minnesota Vikings for a huge package of players and draft picks, and is considered the catalyst for the Cowboys success in the early 90's.  Sale could just as easily command a massive return that sets up the organization for years with quality talent at multiple positions."
whitesox,3e0hyg,ACSimeon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:31:47 2015 UTC,"It's a bad comparison because Herschel wasn't a proven NFL commodity. He had played well in College & the USFL, but he was Tony Dorsett's backup with the Cowboys. Chris Sale is a proven MLB 4-time All-star."
whitesox,3e0hyg,NicCage420,2,Tue Jul 21 18:19:41 2015 UTC,"In terms of getting a boatload of talent back it works, which was all I was really going for. I guess you could look at something like the Miguel Cabrera trade, had it worked out better for Miami."
whitesox,3e0hyg,ACSimeon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:23:59 2015 UTC,LOL
whitesox,3e0hyg,NicCage420,2,Tue Jul 21 18:25:54 2015 UTC,Miller and Maybin were legit top 10-20 prospects at the time. Sale probably commands even more.
whitesox,3e0hyg,ACSimeon,2,Tue Jul 21 18:34:42 2015 UTC,"That's what I'm saying I don't trust the prospect rating system at all. The Cubs prospects like Addison Russell are overrated, our prospects like Tyler Saladino are underrated. We would need Mike Trout + prospects to justify trading Chris Sale."
whitesox,3e0hyg,todd330,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:38:29 2015 UTC,"Some of you seem to disagree with trading Sale.  I agree with you, it would absolutely suck.  But if he stays, is it really going to help the Sox?  I don't see them contending for years, so what good he going to be?  If the Sox trade him, they should be able to get anything they want for him and that's a start to the rebuild."
whitesox,3e0hyg,JROremus,5,Tue Jul 21 03:35:35 2015 UTC,"Trading Sale isn't going to fix every problem. If the Sox are going to suck I'd rather see a potential hall of famer on the hill every five days  Edit: With two wildcard spots and an increase in parity I think it is foolish to trade Chris Sale in 2015. I'm willing to what happens with a Samardzjia trade and any other trades this season and offseason before I unload one of the most valuable players in baseball. Talk to me in 2017 if they are still a last place team, but Sale is too young, too good, and on too great of a contract."
whitesox,3e0hyg,todd330,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:33:42 2015 UTC,I would think it's because of that contract and the fact he is a top 5 pitcher that they can ask for anything they want.
whitesox,3e0hyg,JROremus,2,Tue Jul 21 11:36:37 2015 UTC,"He's worth so much no team would give it up. We're talking like ta teamp's top 4 prospects with at least 3 being for sure proper all stars. No team is going to give up that much for him. They can ask for whatever, but no team will give it, so the Sox lose in every single trade scenario."
whitesox,3e0hyg,mattfromchicago,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:10:18 2015 UTC,"Because he is a Top 5 pitcher and that contract, there's no way any team will be able to match his actual value.  We'd be very, very foolish to deal him at this point in his career, IMO"
whitesox,3e0hyg,mattfromchicago,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:50:53 2015 UTC,"But if he stays, is it really going to help the Sox?   He's probably the best pitcher in baseball right now and signed to a very team friendly deal so... Yes."
whitesox,3e0hyg,mattfromchicago,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:37:35 2015 UTC,"I certainly have no problem with management tearing apart much of this roster.  Samardzija, Quintana, Robertson, get a bag of balls for Alexei, maybe Melky... You know whatever, but the four guys I keep around for sure, no questions asked are:  1) Sale - Absolutely no way anyone will be able to match his value.  I mean, Christ, he's a 5-6+ WAR pitcher whose under a team friendly contract until 2019.  I get the argument that he's being wasted on this shitty team, but this team doesn't get any less shitty moving him.  2) Abreu - Having a bit of a sophomore slump, probably eroded his trade value a bit, unless someone was really willing to overpay, I'd rather just roll the dice with him in 2016.  3) Eaton - Another guy having a down year after a good 2014.  Again, would rather take the risk with a 26-year-old whose already posted a 5 WAR season the Majors.  4) Rodon - Obvs  After that, Avisail, Sanchez, Quintana... Guys I wouldn't WANT to trade, but would be willing to move for the right price...  But yeah, I'd have no problem if the Sox just scrapped a bunch of these middling vets."

whitesox,3dvbxu,samurai5625,22,Sun Jul 19 20:47:50 2015 UTC,Hahn is definitely smart enough to see this. Problem is that Kenny still gets final decisions on transactions.
whitesox,3dvbxu,ggslovin,14,Sun Jul 19 21:25:34 2015 UTC,"This is the right answer. If Hahn had final say, this team would look really different right now. Plus, Ventura would've been gone a long time ago. Hahn would've brought his own guy in probably last season."
whitesox,3dvbxu,AnniesBoobzz,5,Sun Jul 19 22:01:26 2015 UTC,"Ah yes, it is very obvious that 1. Kenny is running the show and 2. Hahn is a genius being held back by the real boss."
whitesox,3dvbxu,jlrc2,3,Mon Jul 20 10:27:01 2015 UTC,Kenny still in the picture scares me.  I hope he goes out the door with Robin
whitesox,3dvbxu,TripleCrown90,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:55:28 2015 UTC,Lol I said this a few weeks ago and got called an idiot for not knowing Hahn was the gm. Totally right though. Williams needs to go just as much as robin imo
whitesox,3dvbxu,waff1ez,13,Mon Jul 20 01:37:58 2015 UTC,"Also agree. There has to be something done about the farm system. To say Buddy Bell's tenure has been underwhelming is an understatement. The flaw this year was the fact that they had a historically bad offense. No players developed from within the system. To be a decent team, that just can't happen. The 3B they traded for from the D-Backs, Davidson, has been a bust. Was it him? Or did their coaches mess the guy up? Its frustrating to see good pitching wasted."
whitesox,3dvbxu,fenriswolff,11,Sun Jul 19 21:09:08 2015 UTC,"Reed has been terrible this season.. so if you look at that trade as a salary dump, then it does sway a little towards favoring the Sox.  Davidson is probably going to be a bust.  But he was never that great to begin with so I don't think that its the sox that have caused his demise.  I'd loooove for the sox to pick up a mike trout caliber guy in the 7th round or whatever.. but its probably not going to happen (not with this front office.)  Their bread and butter seems to be pitching.  If they can draft and develop pitching and trade those prospects for position players/prospects.. that might be the way we build a team in the near future."
whitesox,3dvbxu,waff1ez,2,Sun Jul 19 21:17:46 2015 UTC,"Was Reed making that much? Davidson was supposed to be the power hitting 3B of the future. But, not so much.  You are right that they seem to trade pitching for position players. But why? Just make no attempt at developing position players? That's pathetic."
whitesox,3dvbxu,fenriswolff,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:36:22 2015 UTC,"Overall they saved around 6 million on a closer they really didn't need. Not a ton but when you have 99 loss team a closer is silly.  As to why, I think it's been brought up in this thread enough that the sox cannot develop position players, so id guess they hoped Davidson could pan out and be like konerko on the team. Ok I doubt anyone thought he could be that successful, but you gotta aim high for young players you trade for."
whitesox,3dvbxu,waff1ez,-1,Mon Jul 20 01:42:23 2015 UTC,"I'd settle for them drafting a Mike Trout caliber player in the first round, let alone 7th. The same front office is still in place that decided to pass on Mike Trout for Jared Mitchell. To be fair to them, so did 20+ other teams, but it's disappointing they couldn't see the best prospect/player in baseball was staring them in the face. I can't even remember the last position player the Sox drafted & developed that turned into an above average player."
whitesox,3dvbxu,froglegs_jackson,2,Sun Jul 19 22:31:57 2015 UTC,"I get your point, but using Mike Trout as an example is kind of stupid, as you already pointed out."
whitesox,3dvbxu,JROremus,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:37:48 2015 UTC,"I think it's fair to criticize them for not taking Trout, but expecting them to draft one of the greatest players of all-time in any round is pretty optimistic."
whitesox,3dvbxu,froglegs_jackson,3,Sun Jul 19 23:51:56 2015 UTC,"You're acting as if the White Sox had the #1 pick and the Angels had #2. Stories of later draft picks being amazing just happen sometimes. Most teams passed him up, not just the Sox.  Edit: I totally agree that Sox scouting and development is subpart, but I just think the Trout thing is not a great example of their shortcomings."
whitesox,3dvbxu,JROremus,2,Sun Jul 19 23:56:59 2015 UTC,"I think the trout thing is a perfect example of their shortcomings because they were obviously looking for an outfielder when they drafted Jared Mitchell two picks before Trout. That's a perfect example of the Williams regime's strategy of drafting ""raw athletes"" that have never panned out."
whitesox,3dvbxu,otherbarry2,0,Mon Jul 20 00:09:19 2015 UTC,"It's not like Trout fell to the 30th round, he was the 25th player taken. I'm not saying members of the White Sox scouting staff should be fired because of this, but I think it's fair to criticize them for not realizing the best player in baseball was available at their pick."
whitesox,3dvbxu,froglegs_jackson,-1,Mon Jul 20 00:00:42 2015 UTC,"Okay I was being hyperbolic, but still look at how many teams went over their draft multiple times leading up and didn't take him.   Clearly it is an agree to disagree, but I still don't think that passing on a high school kid that over half of the league also passed on is the best example of pointing out how shitty the Sox are. Feel free to disagree, but the baseball draft is such a crapshoot that I wouldn't use the example."
whitesox,3dvbxu,JROremus,0,Mon Jul 20 00:08:07 2015 UTC,The only reason I brought up Trout is because I was responding to a comment that said they would like the Sox to draft someone of his caliber in the 7th round. Obviously that's not going to happen. Maybe I shouldn't have pointed out they took Mitchell over him? Who knows.
whitesox,3dvbxu,froglegs_jackson,0,Mon Jul 20 00:10:58 2015 UTC,"If the Sox had such a rich history of developing position players, then this wouldn't even be a conversation. But who was the last position player they drafted & developed into an above average player? I honestly don't know.  edit- I was responding to a comment that specifically mentioned Trout. Otherwise I wouldn't have brought him up. I was trying to make a larger point on their lack of success drafting & developing position players."
whitesox,3dvbxu,froglegs_jackson,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:02:11 2015 UTC,"Last drafted and developed position player that ended up even being average was Aaron Rowand. Remember Joe Bordach, Jared Mitchell, Courtney Hawkins (while young, scouts I've talked to still call him a bust and wasted pick), Keon Barnum, Brian Anderson and Gordon Beckham?"
whitesox,3dvbxu,weasol12,-1,Mon Jul 20 19:10:50 2015 UTC,"I'm not disagreeing that they suck, I was simply saying that I don't think Trout is the best example to use.  Their track record speaks for itself. Looking at the start of the year speaks for itself. Out of the 8 position players the only player that we drafted was Micah Johnson. They are completely inept at developing hitters."
whitesox,3dvbxu,JROremus,2,Mon Jul 20 00:11:35 2015 UTC,"I think Davidson was anything but a sure thing. Like he had potential but he also wasn't tearing up the minors (only hitting .268/.351/.452 in his minor league career). The way relievers are so inconsistent year to year I think it was a great chance worth taking. However, you're right that it would have been nice if their coaches could have helped Davidson succeed."
whitesox,3dvbxu,ParkerAdderson,3,Sun Jul 19 21:58:13 2015 UTC,I remember reading an article about the hiring of Buddy Bell years ago and how he stated that he's going to enjoy his job because he'll get to work from home. I thought wtf? This guy is in charge of our farm talent and he doesn't even have to leave his house? How the hell is he going to scout players from there?
whitesox,3dvbxu,arsesox,12,Mon Jul 20 02:04:35 2015 UTC,"I've been desperately trying to find any kind of light in this season but it's over. I give up. The little streak before the asg gave me hope, but that's gone. I don't blame management or even the worst manager in the league. Every single player on this team is playing worse than they can. This is on the players. Hahn went for it, and kudos to him. I don't remember the last time I was this pumped for the Sox, but nobody could predict how lazy and fundamentally bad this team would be.   TEAR.IT.DOWN."
whitesox,3dvbxu,Odbdb,2,Sun Jul 19 21:22:37 2015 UTC,"I don't think there is much of a talent gap between the Sox and the Royals. The Royals don't do anything exceptional, they just play sound fundamental baseball. The difference is Ned Yost and his coaching staff are just decent.  With the exception of Coop, who is one of the best in the game, this staff is horrendous.   Looking back at the last five or so years I saw less than talented teams over-achieve under Ozzie but eventually falter due to lack of talent. His teams were always disciplined on defense and were, although disappointing in clutch situations, a joy to watch.   The last season and a half under Ventura have been disgusting to watch besides the pitching.  The defense, base running, and plate discipline has been getting sloppier with every game played.    The proof in the pudding is Melky and LaRoache.  If you watched this season you could see they regretted their decisions soon after the season began.   Ventura and most of the staff needs to go. The sooner the better, so we can get back to watching decent baseball again."
whitesox,3dvbxu,todd330,9,Sun Jul 19 22:58:14 2015 UTC,Laroache is pretty much Adam Dunn that hits ten points higher.  Not sure what they thought they were getting with him.
whitesox,3dvbxu,gotpez,4,Sun Jul 19 23:28:31 2015 UTC,Seems like every free agent acquisition we get regresses at the plate. I think the front office expected a .260-.265 25 homers 80 rbi player which really wasn't unreasonable. But something about this club/coaching staff/park or whatever ruins hitters' careers
whitesox,3dvbxu,todd330,2,Mon Jul 20 03:42:26 2015 UTC,Yeah that sounds about right.
whitesox,3dvbxu,Mrslinger85,2,Mon Jul 20 11:30:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, with LaRoche, I was expecting .255-.260, 20-25 hrs, .375 OBP, and 80 or so RBIs, which really is reasonable compared to his prior years. The fact that ever single player is playing below their career averages says something."
whitesox,3dvbxu,thraser11,5,Mon Jul 20 12:38:55 2015 UTC,"Agree. Any team can put together a stretch of decent baseball, but we have no where close to the talent necessary to sustain it over 2 months."
whitesox,3dvbxu,DomCaboose,4,Sun Jul 19 21:02:29 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. There were too many people jumping on the ""buy and go for it train"" a few days ago."
whitesox,3dvbxu,DomCaboose,2,Mon Jul 20 00:32:51 2015 UTC,Like what exactly? I think they need to sell shark and get something good for him that is nearly MLB ready like Avi. Who could they deal to make some of these shrewd moves?
whitesox,3dvbxu,PigFarmington,2,Mon Jul 20 00:34:53 2015 UTC,This isn't going to happen. Kenny is an idiot and thinks every year is 2006.
whitesox,3dvbxu,tagusan,2,Mon Jul 20 00:37:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they're done.  After Sale gave up that run in the first today, a guy sitting by me at the game said ""game over.""  A few people laughed, but the sad thing was, the guy was right.  You can't have an offense this inept in the American League and compete.  The worst thing is how good their pitching has been.  If they coild score runs and had a decent manager, we'd be rolling.  Interesting side note... I saw a few elderly people at the park with shirts that said ""bring ozzie guillen back as manager.""  They were some strange, obviously homemade shirts.  But when you think about it, it's crazy enough it just might work!"
whitesox,3dvbxu,wesnotwes,4,Mon Jul 20 13:55:20 2015 UTC,You can't trade for draft picks.
whitesox,3dvbxu,jlrc2,-1,Mon Jul 20 00:18:03 2015 UTC,"Not much you can really do as a seller beyond trading Samardzija and even then you need to do better than the compensatory pick you'd otherwise get. I'd rather see us try to add a longer term piece to make the team more watchable this year and better prepared for next. There won't be some full scale dismantling, we just got done doing that."
whitesox,3dw6sw,ybny23,5,Mon Jul 20 01:14:29 2015 UTC,"Many said Frank was not the warm and fuzzy guy you see now back then. He got hurt early in 05, and after that the Sox decided not to offer him a new deal."

whitesox,3dw6sw,mushperv,3,Mon Jul 20 23:53:51 2015 UTC,He very well be. But there were some who said he was a bit selfish and kind of a shitty teammate back then.  Very well could have matured. Seems like a class act now.

whitesox,3dw6sw,Moses_Scurry,4,Tue Jul 21 00:25:33 2015 UTC,In November of 05 the sox announced they would not be renewing his contract. He had some choice words for them and Kenny in the press. He signed with Oakland and had a decent year. Every stop along the way he dissed the sox. After he got out of the game he eventually came back around.
whitesox,3dw6sw,Mrslinger85,3,Mon Jul 20 05:00:48 2015 UTC,"I don't think Frank leaving was that bad. The worse times with Frank was back in the late '90's. First it was him not being happy with the contract that he signed, kind of like Scottie Pippen. Then he was unhappy because Jerry put a diminishing skills clause in his contract where they could opt out or pay him less (I can't remember which) if he failed to produce at a certain level. I can't remember if they actually exercised the clause, but he was pretty mad about having it in the first place. I remember thinking it was a clever thing to have, but I am not aware of anybody before or after having one, so I understand his frustration with it. I'm sure the Yanks would have loved to have one in Arod's contract.  To keep Frank in '06, they would have had to pay him quite a bit more than Oakland paid him. He was coming off a season that he only played a handful of games, plus he had other big injuries in the preceding seasons. They had PK and either had Thome or had a plan in the works to get him. Letting Frank go was the right decision at the time. It sucks that he couldn't get #500 in a Sox uniform, but it happens with most of the big stars. Mays didn't finish his career with the Giants either."
whitesox,3dw6sw,ACSimeon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:13:24 2015 UTC,makes sense that they probably would have had to pay him a good amount in '06.  Thanks for the info

whitesox,3dw6sw,america_rex,5,Mon Jul 20 01:18:13 2015 UTC,Oh yeah I definitely agree with you that they have made up and that the Sox have definitely honored his career
whitesox,3dw6sw,awinsalot,3,Mon Jul 20 01:20:56 2015 UTC,"There are lots of reasons, but in the end Frank thought nobody cared about what he had done in his career and he was cast aside for Jim Thome. The Sox thought he would never come back from injury and the fans just wanted the 05 magic to continue. After Frank proved he still had it with the A's, the Sox collapsed in 06 and he was hailed as a true, clean legend who had been looked over in the steroid era he felt vindicated."
whitesox,3dw6sw,GrindyMcGrindy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:21:35 2015 UTC,Yeah I was wondering if it had something to do with Either Thome or Konerko.  Thanks for the info
whitesox,3dw6sw,mattfromchicago,4,Mon Jul 20 23:57:30 2015 UTC,Thomas was pretty much done.  He was breaking down physically and the Sox moved on.  Even when the rest of the league knew he was done a few years later it took Thomas another one to agree.  http://sports.espn.go.com/chicago/mlb/news/story?id=4908616
whitesox,3dw6sw,awinsalot,8,Mon Jul 20 01:54:24 2015 UTC,I mean he wasnt done. He had a damn good year with the As in 06 and even had a solid year in Toronto in 07. He played 71 games in 2008 and thats when you could see it was all over.

whitesox,3dut9o,ACSimeon,3,Sun Jul 19 20:37:26 2015 UTC,"Hey man, I live in KC now so I can only make it to 1-2 at the Cell every year, but I appreciate you being a good fan and getting to the park as often as you do. We need more fans like you! It's not like it's expensive"
whitesox,3dut9o,arsesox,4,Sun Jul 19 21:25:06 2015 UTC,"Not at all, it's the best value in sports. I plan my schedule around the in-park promotions. I've got so much swag from this year. Even when we're losing, we're the best team."
whitesox,3dut9o,ACSimeon,2,Sun Jul 19 21:26:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah didn't get the win, but I really like watching Saladino play so seeing his first hr was cool"
whitesox,3dut9o,ACSimeon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:41:43 2015 UTC,"He should have been safe on that bunt too, and it was a successful bunt either way. It's bullcrap they didn't capitalize."
whitesox,3du7nn,DidierDogba,18,Sun Jul 19 14:52:37 2015 UTC,Whoa. Wasn't expecting that. But it was time.
whitesox,3du7nn,ggslovin,13,Sun Jul 19 16:09:39 2015 UTC,Shame. I was hoping he could turn into something decent after last season.
whitesox,3du7nn,crustyruffles,8,Sun Jul 19 16:05:58 2015 UTC,The guy is a utility player that the Sox had to count on for more because their 3B trade for Davidson was a failure and they are unable to develop position players within their own system.
whitesox,3du7nn,fenriswolff,-1,Sun Jul 19 21:15:24 2015 UTC,"Pretty much.  That also basically describes Beckham, as well.  And now Saladino, too, probably"
whitesox,3du7nn,mattfromchicago,-1,Mon Jul 20 13:46:26 2015 UTC,Spot on.  Thanks Kenny!
whitesox,3du7nn,rhodeislandslut,4,Mon Jul 20 01:45:49 2015 UTC,"Gillaspie was never going to hit well enough to compensate for his awful glove at 3B, or to break into the lineup as a regular starter at LF, 1B or DH. His history would indicate he could maybe fit in as the left-handed half of a platoon somewhere, but even with the Sox working hard to keep him away from left-handed pitching, he's been terrible this against righties, too.   Even assuming he can rebound to be decent against righties again, Gillaspie is only marginally useful. With him doing nothing to help win this year and becoming more expensive through arbitration this offseason, giving Saladino his look now is absolutely the right decision."
whitesox,3du7nn,ChrisPummer,6,Sun Jul 19 16:58:09 2015 UTC,"That is a shame. He had plantar fasciitis, which is what he was playing with and it is extremely painful. He is getting paid the league minimum, so it's not like he's sucking up money. But the Sox gotta do what they gotta do."
whitesox,3du7nn,RushLimbaughIsFat,2,Sun Jul 19 16:33:56 2015 UTC,"Planter fasciitis sucks. Can confirm, just recently got it myself."

whitesox,3du7nn,Koneesha,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:09:39 2015 UTC,"It didn't help that he was injured for most of the year.  I think he's better than what he's shown this year, but I also think last season was kind of a fluke.  I see Gillespie as a .250-.260 hitter, which I'd totally take this season. That being said, I am in the same camp as you."
whitesox,3du7nn,Mrslinger85,0,Mon Jul 20 12:49:12 2015 UTC,"I mean i could see a bit higher at 260 to like 270, plus i just like his swing. haha. Id rather have some offense with shabby defense at this point then defense with no offense."

whitesox,3dunlm,RushLimbaughIsFat,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:07:01 2015 UTC,I just wish we could draft some position players and actually develop guys instead of buying everyone.  Even great pitching is useless if your guys can't score runs.

whitesox,3dunlm,heavykevy1983,4,Sun Jul 19 20:46:57 2015 UTC,It's good. Sorry I get a little annoyed when people shit on Sanchez. Don't get me wrong he shouldn't be in the majors yet. He needs more time in the minors. But it isn't his fault that the front office didnt have a second baseman for this team.
whitesox,3dunlm,The-Assman,0,Sun Jul 19 20:49:26 2015 UTC,"Also, Flowers isn't the worst of our problems."

whitesox,3dunlm,The-Assman,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:46:08 2015 UTC,That's not how reddit works. It would cancel out up votes in the case of multiple accounts. They track IP's so you don't up vote yourself and multiply down vote others.

I know I'm better than that and I hope you can all eventually forgive me for my outbursts. Again, I sincerely apologize to anyone I may have offended.   On to today's game, we got the best pitcher in the game on the mound. I think we're gonna be just fine. Let's get the split in this series and keep gaining momentum towards the wildcard.

whitesox,3dsdk9,ricker182,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:29:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, same here. Ended up buying one for 85 signed by Reinsdorf."
whitesox,3ds9r5,Odbdb,8,Sat Jul 18 23:37:49 2015 UTC,"At this point Robin is going down with the ship.    I still don't see the fire sale happening yet, gotta wait to see where we are at during the trade deadline.  If we win tomorrow and then keep winning series going into the deadline, I see us becoming buyers.  The thing is, our hitting is starting to heat up.  Melky is hitting again, Saladino looks good, Eaton is getting on base more, but the problem is, we still aren't hitting when it counts.  We still leave too many people on base.    It was nice to see us get some good 2 out rallies here but ultimately we still don't have timely hitting.   I'm giving it another week and a half. Reassess there."
whitesox,3ds9r5,dhcrazy333,3,Sun Jul 19 00:00:41 2015 UTC,Abreu isn't driving in runs and needs to become the hitter he was last year for us to stand a chance
whitesox,3ds9r5,gotpez,2,Sun Jul 19 05:38:25 2015 UTC,I think he is pressing and trying to do too much. He isn't getting much to hit and is going after more bad pitches to try and make something happen. It's not like anyone is going to knock him in if he walks.
whitesox,3ds9r5,baraksobamas,3,Sun Jul 19 13:24:02 2015 UTC,"Win tomorrow, maybe take another 2 from the Cardinals, see where we go from there."
whitesox,3ds9r5,ACSimeon,2,Sun Jul 19 00:18:26 2015 UTC,"I hope we get a manager that understands how to run a modern pitching staff.   Shark,  Sale, Peavy, all lost games on a regular basis throwing too long.    Why Jennings stayed out today was beyond my comprehension."
whitesox,3ds9r5,the_cro,2,Sun Jul 19 00:03:39 2015 UTC,"Jennings pitched fine.  If Robertson came in and gave up a blast, I'd hear people saying ""Jennings was pitching fine! Why bring in the last reliever we have when the game could go further!""  Honestly I thought Robertson should have been in there in the 10th, but I was fine with Jennings staying in.  He pitched fine. 3.2 innings, 1 run.  Made one mistake, as can any pitcher."
whitesox,3ds9r5,dhcrazy333,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:38:25 2015 UTC,Probably trying to stretch him one more because Robertson was the last pen arm. I'm not too upset with the decision myself.
whitesox,3ds9r5,JROremus,-2,Sun Jul 19 01:11:59 2015 UTC,"Not sure what you're bitching about, the Sox have a very good track record when it comes to pitcher's health compared to other teams.  I can't even remember the last important pitcher we lost to Tommy John surgery"
whitesox,3ds9r5,mattfromchicago,-1,Sun Jul 19 06:06:48 2015 UTC,because they blow their shoulders out before they even develop elbow problems
whitesox,3ds9r5,baraksobamas,-1,Sun Jul 19 13:26:25 2015 UTC,What?
whitesox,3ds9r5,mattfromchicago,-2,Sun Jul 19 14:41:34 2015 UTC,"Who's going?   Chris Sale would probably land this team enough blue chip prospects to propel them into the top 10 of minor league systems, without trading anyone else. If they're not at least listening to offers for him, this organization is doomed to futility."
whitesox,3ds9r5,Lana_Phrasing,2,Sun Jul 19 14:26:52 2015 UTC,Or we can keep one of the most dominant pitchers in the game on one of the most team friendly contracts and build a team around him.
whitesox,3ds9r5,constapatedape,0,Sun Jul 19 15:26:15 2015 UTC,Yeah but if the Sox had halfway decent farm talent we wouldn't have to entertain the idea of trading Sale.
whitesox,3ds9r5,samurai5625,-3,Sun Jul 19 17:28:10 2015 UTC,"Or we   ""They""   can keep one of the most dominant pitchers in the game   Which is great and all, but what's the use of having a lights-out starter when the team around him can't score runs because of a complete lack of offensive production and talent constituting the rest of the roster?    on one of the most team friendly contracts   That sword cuts both ways. His team-friendly contract only increases his value in trade.    and build a team around him.   ...which the organization has shown absolutely no ability to do, even through the draft.   So what are the alternatives? Wait out two more years of sucktitude and lack of talent at the 8 other positions on the field, until Sale is 28 and in the last year of his deal, and then try to stock the farm with what would be a rental? Wait until his age-29 season and hope, if his arm hasn't blown up by then, that he rejects a qualifying tender so the team can get one draft pick in the compensatory round?   The Sox are really, really, bad. Their farm system is still really, really, bad when you look for positional talent: Matt Davidson and Tim Anderson--the best hope the Sox have at producing any kind of anything at a position other than pitcher--are both slugging below .400...in the minor leagues.   It's time to divorce yourself from the idea that the Sox can just miraculously ""build around"" someone, when they haven't been able to do that since...ever? Chris Sale's value has never been higher, and it'd be stupid not to entertain the notion of dealing him for a king's ransom, especially with all the prospect-laden teams out there that still need pitching desperately."
whitesox,3ds9r5,Lana_Phrasing,4,Sun Jul 19 17:43:54 2015 UTC,"The Sox could never get value back in a trade for Sale. His talent and contract are that good. It's all well and good to say the Sox could get a huge haul for him, but what team is giving up all of those prospects?"
whitesox,3ds9r5,ChrisPummer,0,Sun Jul 19 17:51:39 2015 UTC,"The Sox could never get value back in a trade for Sale.   That's just not true. Never mind the subjective ""value"" in the form of having players from multiple positions, and in multiple phases of the game (offense and defense, instead of just pitching) contributing more often than a pitcher does, but Sale's WAR could be equaled, or even bettered, by three solid--or even two outstanding--position players.    His talent and contract are that good.   That also means that the Sox can demand more for him, rightly so, from other teams. Again, the ""he's really good and has a great contract"" sword cuts both ways.    but what team is giving up all of those prospects?   The Dodgers probably would (Dan Haren has been getting lit up). The Sox could demand Joc Pederson, Julio Urias, and Grant Holmes to start. A playoff rotation of Sale, Kershaw, and Greinke would virtually guarantee three wins to start off a playoff series.   The Mets could be another destination. They have a plethora of prospects to spare and are still in the playoff hunt, and would love to solidify the best starting rotation in baseball."
whitesox,3ds9r5,Lana_Phrasing,2,Sun Jul 19 18:31:55 2015 UTC,"You have to assume the Dodgers would actually give up that package, and that all of those guys pan out -- definitely not a sure thing. Right now I'm skeptical of both."

whitesox,3dravb,MustacheMark,3,Sat Jul 18 18:55:06 2015 UTC,I'm glad the Royals dumped the Bad Boy Pistons attitude they had at the beginning of the season.

whitesox,3dravb,Petey_Peppers,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:22:48 2015 UTC,T-Flow down the toilet.
whitesox,3dtva2,Foehammer_419,15,Sun Jul 19 12:20:43 2015 UTC,"The season is more than half over, they're in last place, and they have less than a 5% chance of making the playoffs. I don't want to see them trade the small amount of talent they have in the minors for a guy who is making lots of money but has rapidly declining numbers."
whitesox,3dtva2,ggslovin,3,Sun Jul 19 13:16:15 2015 UTC,The main point that the OP failed to mention was the Rays are only 3.5 games back in the East and would not trade their #3 hitter and arguably the most important player in that lineup. They're actually above .500.
whitesox,3dtva2,JBProds,-6,Sun Jul 19 17:46:18 2015 UTC,"The White Sox have more minor league talent than anyone outside of the organization gives them credit for. The system is being underrated, and I don't care how many down votes I get for this opinion. If I wanted to be pessimistic, I'd be a Phillies fan. I take comfort in knowing guys like Courtney Hawkins, Carlos Sanchez, Micah Johnson, Erik Johnson, Frankie Montas, Tyler Saladino, Matt Davidson, Carson Fulmer and Tim Anderson are waiting in the wings. Just waiting to prove themselves worthy."
whitesox,3dtva2,ACSimeon,7,Sun Jul 19 13:25:37 2015 UTC,And they shouldn't trade any of it away. Not with the position they're in.
whitesox,3dtva2,ggslovin,0,Sun Jul 19 13:28:20 2015 UTC,"No, the White Sox should probably stand pat or sell on guys that are on the decline. It's probably already time to look at how we can build for 2016, but that doesn't mean we need to give up on 2015.   Our Wild Card elimination number is the same as the Rangers, Indians, and Blue Jays. We'll look a lot better once we make it past the Royals & Cardinals too."
whitesox,3dtva2,ACSimeon,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:33:49 2015 UTC,"Let's face it we have 0 impact bats coming up in the near future I would be ok trading guys like Thompson, Hawkins, even Johnson. This team is built to contend for the next 3 years or so.   Sale and Q are reaching their primes, samardzija is at the twilight of his. Abreu and Cabrera aren't getting any younger. Longoria would add a player to compete in that timeframe."
whitesox,3dtva2,mushperv,2,Sun Jul 19 13:56:54 2015 UTC,"Not true. Anderson is definitely an impact offensive player, and both Thompson and Hawkins could be as well."
whitesox,3dtva2,mushperv,4,Sun Jul 19 14:10:18 2015 UTC,He's making a shit ton of money and he's injury prone.  The only thing I want to see this team do is sell. I've seen enough. Trade Shark and whoever else for prospects that can hit and play for 2016.
whitesox,3dtva2,Lana_Phrasing,7,Sun Jul 19 14:08:37 2015 UTC,"So...let me get this straight: You want the White Sox, who are dead-last in their own division at 12 games back, 8 games back of a wildcard spot with 8 other teams in front of them, and who have only recently begun the climb from their resident spot as cellar-dweller in terms of minor league systems...you want that team, to sacrifice their still-pathetic youthful talent pool in an effort to be buyers at the trade deadline?   Oh, and you think that they would be in the market for the starting 3B and third-best OPS+ of a team only 3.5 games back of their own division lead, and 3 games back of a wildcard spot, with a little less than half the season remaining?   Normally, this is where I'd say ""this ain't a video game, kid"", but I'm positive even the CPU teams in MLB 15 The Show would laugh hysterically at your proposal.   This is why that run-up to the All-Star Break was a gruesome dead cat bounce: now people can delude themselves into thinking this god-awful team has a shot at anything.   They should be looking to trade away anyone and everyone, including Chris Sale, to fill the holes they have at literally everywhere."
whitesox,3dtva2,Mrslinger85,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:22:47 2015 UTC,"I say mark this year up as a loss.  See if they can deal Shark and Ramirez.  Move Danks to middle relief next year, and move up some of our prospects in September and see how they do.  I want to be optimistic, but there is no way we are going to make it to the playoffs with how we play against this division."
whitesox,3dtva2,ACSimeon,-1,Mon Jul 20 13:16:55 2015 UTC,"I don't hate Longoria, and I think we could get a good deal for him because his value is at an all-time low. BUT...  I also think Saladino's doing a great job & we have Matt Davidson in the system, so we should really be looking at people who can play the 2B/SS. Sanchez, Beckham, Ramirez and Bonifacio really aren't getting the job done often enough.  I think if we offered Beckham, Gillaspie & a solid reliever, we might get back something decent."
whitesox,3dtva2,ACSimeon,4,Sun Jul 19 13:03:17 2015 UTC,I would suggest letting saladino play second and sending Sanchez down.
whitesox,3dtva2,mushperv,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:50:44 2015 UTC,"If Saladino plays 2nd as well as he plays 3rd, then I agree. That could be the move."
whitesox,3dtva2,ACSimeon,3,Sun Jul 19 14:06:37 2015 UTC,Anderson is 2B/SS of future. But I agree that we should call Davidson up and see what he had at 3B.
whitesox,3dtva2,mushperv,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:11:15 2015 UTC,"I hope you're right. We should try him out, because Sanchez needs more seasoning. I'd like to think Carlos has a future too, but he's definitely not the present."
whitesox,3dtva2,ACSimeon,4,Sun Jul 19 16:04:36 2015 UTC,"I like Sanchez's glove, he's shown flashes of being really solid there. But his bat is way behind."
whitesox,3dtva2,arsesox,0,Sun Jul 19 16:39:15 2015 UTC,"If he fixes his batting, he can be great though."
whitesox,3dtva2,ACSimeon,3,Sun Jul 19 16:46:28 2015 UTC,I hate to say this it Matt Davidson is a busy who will never make it in the bigs. Not that's stopped us from playing people...
whitesox,3dtva2,JBProds,0,Sun Jul 19 14:24:05 2015 UTC,"I hope you're wrong, a lot of people on this sub seem high on him."
whitesox,3dqcmi,fosho17,14,Sat Jul 18 12:38:12 2015 UTC,"This kid knows how to run the bases, knows where to go with the ball, can bunt, can get timely hits, and is a solid glove at 3rd.  I really thought Conner was gonna take a step forward this year.  He had a great average last year.  I don't know what happened to him.  I hope he figures it out.  In the meantime Tyler is our guy."
whitesox,3dqcmi,Meatmehalfway,4,Sat Jul 18 13:30:18 2015 UTC,"Gillaspie had a .325 BABIP last year which is way higher than anything he's ever produced, so he was getting very lucky. This year it's .275 and his career avg is .291. His hard hit% was also 29 last year and is 22% this year, which puts him in the bottom 25 in the league with Alexei and Melky. Also given how bad he is at defense, he's probably not worth a roster spot going forward."
whitesox,3dqcmi,thraser11,3,Sat Jul 18 14:25:42 2015 UTC,His defense is the real killer for him in my eyes. He fields like a fucking high schooler on the JV team out there
whitesox,3dqcmi,Kumdogmillionaire,11,Sat Jul 18 21:04:16 2015 UTC,I think the kid has an amazing amount of heart. He is a White Sox. He plays like that jersey means something to him and I appreciate that as a fan. I think this guy is going to be playing and making a difference for us for years to come.
whitesox,3dqcmi,Petey_Peppers,5,Sat Jul 18 13:13:09 2015 UTC,"There's just something special about players that were drafted by us, and made it through our system. True homegrown players. Just like Gordon Beckham.  Edit: spelling"
whitesox,3dqcmi,Petey_Peppers,-12,Sat Jul 18 14:15:30 2015 UTC,Our system is very quietly becoming one of the best in all of baseball. It's great watching these kids come up and succeed at such a high level at the highest level. The future is bright.
whitesox,3dqcmi,doverawlings,6,Sat Jul 18 14:31:37 2015 UTC,"That's just not true. I've seen you comment a lot on reddit and I love your optimism, but you really just don't have a realistic outlook."
whitesox,3dqcmi,AlonneCaptain,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:47:56 2015 UTC,"While I agree with you partially that we aren't going to all of a sudden be on of the best teams again, we do have most of our good players come from our farms like Rodon and Saladino, who's looking promising.   All of our big buys (Laroche, and to an extent, Cabrera) have not been living up to our expectations."
whitesox,3dqcmi,Petey_Peppers,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:10:45 2015 UTC,"Agree to disagree here.   Saladino is making a HUGE difference and that's easy to see. Tim Anderson is the SS of the future and a perennial all star in the making. The drafting of Rodon and his immediate overwhelming success shows a great ability to recognize talent. The system is also full of stud arms like, Montas, Adams, and Danish. I'm not saying all these guys are coming up for us, but we have a great farm system with a lot of pieces other teams would love to have in their farm. They have pieces to come up and make immediate impact and pieces they can trade if they are so inclined. The future is very bright for the future of the White Sox."
whitesox,3dqcmi,rhodeislandslut,2,Sat Jul 18 15:57:57 2015 UTC,Perennial all star in the making?  How many MLB at bats does he have?
whitesox,3dqcmi,Petey_Peppers,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:06:13 2015 UTC,"He has the raw talent you can plainly see in a star before they make the big leagues. He's still putting the finishing touches on his game, but he has the sort of raw talent you just don't see everyday. He's a freak. You're going to love him in time. Great speed."
whitesox,3dqcmi,rhodeislandslut,3,Sat Jul 18 16:09:41 2015 UTC,Great speed like Micah Johnson?  Or great speed like Jared Mitchell?

whitesox,3dqcmi,ACSimeon,6,Sat Jul 18 23:39:13 2015 UTC,"Saladino has been marginally better than Conor Gillaspie, but the team's improvement is highly noticeable.  Why does it look like the skipper of the Charlotte Knights is better than Robin Ventura at coaching up position players?"
whitesox,3dqcmi,rhodeislandslut,4,Sat Jul 18 14:18:34 2015 UTC,"He probably IS better, is the problem."
whitesox,3dqcmi,terriblepotatoes,3,Sat Jul 18 16:06:43 2015 UTC,"I'm excited to see this kid play everytime he is up to bat, i hope he turns into a great 3rd basemen, and I hope he is the clutch guy the Sox need"

whitesox,3dqcmi,the_gracker,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:22:52 2015 UTC,He seems like a good addition but what happens with Davidson?
whitesox,3dqcmi,america_rex,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:32:32 2015 UTC,Keep him in the minors. He can't hit and probably never will
whitesox,3dqcmi,jlrc2,0,Sat Jul 18 23:03:37 2015 UTC,"He's a nice little player. I'm not ready to anoint him the starter of the future at any particular position, but he deserves a shot for sure. He has a fairly low ceiling, but also a high floor as he doesn't really have any damning weaknesses. At worst he should make for a good bench bat and glove player."
whitesox,3dqcmi,Jacob_Montanez,0,Sat Jul 18 16:14:48 2015 UTC,"He's great, with Albers coming back I say they send down Sanchez and try Gillespie or Saladino at 2nd"
whitesox,3dqtlg,terriblepotatoes,4,Sat Jul 18 15:50:06 2015 UTC,Definitely Gillaspie. He's just a butcher at defense and his hitting hasn't been very good this year.

whitesox,3dohv9,Meatmehalfway,4,Sat Jul 18 00:52:49 2015 UTC,I really like that he shows his emotions. Unlike the dead face of Robin.
whitesox,3dohv9,NineduceXII,-1,Sat Jul 18 00:56:56 2015 UTC,Unlike the dead Robin.   FTFY Robin is really just a puppet that KW controls hence no emotions.

whitesox,3dohv9,thom_weights,3,Sat Jul 18 02:10:48 2015 UTC,Hawk's the kind of guy to shoot a kid 10 extra times point blank just to make sure he gets hit.
whitesox,3dohv9,bababooey55,4,Sat Jul 18 02:13:44 2015 UTC,He's got that TWTW

whitesox,3dohv9,Koneesha,3,Sat Jul 18 02:24:38 2015 UTC,Danks' performace is really random sometimes. Either he gets an outing with 0 ER or an outing with 10 ER.
whitesox,3dohv9,RushLimbaughIsFat,3,Sat Jul 18 02:27:19 2015 UTC,He's like 8-1 against the Royals at home though

whitesox,3dohv9,Meatmehalfway,4,Sat Jul 18 03:19:55 2015 UTC,Ova!   Damn this pitching staff is something. Would be nice if we could score a few more runs.
whitesox,3dohv9,bababooey55,-2,Sat Jul 18 03:20:19 2015 UTC,Best rotation in baseball.
whitesox,3dohv9,Petey_Peppers,7,Sat Jul 18 03:28:55 2015 UTC,I'm sick of seeing Sanchez. I don't hate him as a person. I just dislike him as a player right now. 1 Micah please.

whitesox,3dohv9,Koneesha,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:49:14 2015 UTC,"Too bad we can't DH for Sanchez and let Shark bat when he pitches. As for Micah, I don't think his defense a good enough reason at this point to overlook his .318 avg and 22 SBs in AAA."
whitesox,3dohv9,JBProds,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:04:03 2015 UTC,"Is there anywhere we can find milb defensive stats. I would have to guess he has gotten better with the glove.   I mean the whole teams defense was pretty bad during his stretch so it made him look worse, but I'd take his offensive now where the more steady defense can hold him up.  We need a sparkplug and he could be it."

whitesox,3dohv9,thom_weights,2,Sat Jul 18 02:39:51 2015 UTC,Saladino has sparked all the junior bats.  Sanchez has two hits and flowers has an RBI. He's the God damn golden Buddha!
whitesox,3dohv9,Meatmehalfway,3,Sat Jul 18 02:42:36 2015 UTC,Probably gonna lose this challenge. Slow motion showed the ball before the foot.   Edit: confirmed out.
whitesox,3dohv9,NineduceXII,3,Sat Jul 18 02:42:12 2015 UTC,I am so nostalgic for an offense.

whitesox,3dohv9,MustacheMark,3,Fri Jul 17 23:55:12 2015 UTC,I'm here and I'm expecting a win.
whitesox,3dohv9,Petey_Peppers,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:57:08 2015 UTC,I knew you were. Ghost town! My broadcast isn't coming in tonight so I'm listening to the radio.
whitesox,3dohv9,MustacheMark,2,Fri Jul 17 23:58:15 2015 UTC,I don't care for Ed Farmer. He often sounds bitter for the sake of being bitter.  I'd prefer more positivity in our radio broadcasts.
whitesox,3dohv9,Petey_Peppers,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:04:09 2015 UTC,"Hes also boring. I like DJ. But Ed is often like ""here's the pitch....home run for Abreu"" no excitement."
whitesox,3dohv9,MustacheMark,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:09:21 2015 UTC,"Runner on first were one swing away from two runs. The guy constantly talks about home runs.   He's amazingly bitter. I can recall someone grounding into an out to advance the runner and hi-5'ing teammates on the way into the dug out. Ed Farmer's reaction to this common occurrence? ""In my day you just sat down when you made an out. No need to high five the entire dug out."" He's old, he's out of touch, and he's not the image White Sox baseball should be putting forward."
whitesox,3dohv9,Petey_Peppers,5,Sat Jul 18 00:18:50 2015 UTC,and his contract is up after this season ;)
whitesox,3dohv9,callmeroo,2,Sat Jul 18 00:19:51 2015 UTC,He will be renewed because he's a loyal soldier. Ed Farmer will do terrible radio announcing until he dies because he has the support of higher ups in the organization. This line of thinking is hurting the health of the ball club in places a lot more important than in the radio broadcast booth.
whitesox,3dohv9,Petey_Peppers,2,Sat Jul 18 00:27:40 2015 UTC,"This is spot on. Once you're in with Jerry Reinsdorf, you have a job for life."
whitesox,3dohv9,froglegs_jackson,2,Sat Jul 18 00:37:06 2015 UTC,"Well put. I also noticed his mentioning of home runs. Darrin often says ""well, that would be great but I'd take a single"" as if not to offend him."
whitesox,3dohv9,MustacheMark,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:20:53 2015 UTC,"I once heard Ed Farmer belittle DJ for daring to disagree with him about something, he told DJ, ""Here's a $20 go tell someone who cares.""    He's abrasive. He's aggressive. He's negative and he does not reflect what White Sox baseball stands for."

whitesox,3dohv9,bababooey55,2,Sat Jul 18 01:44:49 2015 UTC,I've been at both games today and I gotta say Saladino's got a ton of confidence out there and has looked very solid defensively.I'm really liking the way he's playing overall and I can't wait to see him play more in the future.

whitesox,3dr8og,Koneesha,3,Sat Jul 18 18:06:52 2015 UTC,"Dude, there is parking EVERYWHERE. Suck it up and enjoy the fact that people are actually going"
whitesox,3dr8og,arsesox,-4,Sat Jul 18 19:21:57 2015 UTC,There actually wasn't. Even third party lots were full.
whitesox,3dr8og,thom_weights,3,Sat Jul 18 21:34:09 2015 UTC,"I don't know why people don't just take the L, it's literally right there."
whitesox,3dr8og,Petey_Peppers,7,Sat Jul 18 20:05:19 2015 UTC,Packed house to celebrate our beloved 05 World Series champions. It's a beautiful thing.
whitesox,3dr8og,Petey_Peppers,-12,Sat Jul 18 18:09:31 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't call it beautiful.   Edit: The scene was beautiful, but parking was horrendous."
whitesox,3dr8og,todd330,14,Sat Jul 18 18:11:38 2015 UTC,It's a minor inconvenience for such a joyous day. Enjoy the game. God bless.
whitesox,3dr8og,Georgie56,-12,Sat Jul 18 18:14:49 2015 UTC,"It's a huge inconvenience because no one tells you what to do and then you have to get all the way back to the park. It's pretty fucked up.  Edit: Don't really get the downvotes, but ok. I'm just upset over it all. The parking attendants were not helpful at all."
whitesox,3dr8og,The1andonlyZack,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:16:33 2015 UTC,"Not sure the roads they are on, but they were directing us toward the 3rd parking lot (the one with the ground looks like its made of brick) while the one next to it was more than half empty.  It had a sign for cash, so I don't see why we couldn't park there while it was still empty.  Oh well, I'm just happy I got a spot."
whitesox,3dr8og,baraksobamas,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:48:49 2015 UTC,"When I go to games, I usually take the CTA. It's much easier, and you won't have to worry about parking one bit!"

whitesox,3dr8og,mattfromchicago,0,Wed Jul 22 03:52:30 2015 UTC,This happens every time there is a big crowd. There really could not have been many worse places to put the stadium.
whitesox,3dr8og,purplenightsky,-2,Sat Jul 18 18:59:13 2015 UTC,We came in from the suburbs so taking the train isn't so easy. 😕
whitesox,3dn42t,whexi,12,Fri Jul 17 16:50:04 2015 UTC,Did he walk 23?
whitesox,3dn42t,JROremus,4,Fri Jul 17 16:51:59 2015 UTC,"Surprisingly no, but I don't think it was this year"
whitesox,3dn42t,Petey_Peppers,9,Fri Jul 17 16:57:43 2015 UTC,How far into the future do you regularly dream?
whitesox,3dn42t,terriblepotatoes,5,Fri Jul 17 17:49:24 2015 UTC,"Never set but it didn't seem like this years team, but was mostly just him pitching so who knows."
whitesox,3dn42t,america_rex,3,Fri Jul 17 18:14:30 2015 UTC,was he wearing a sox uniform????
whitesox,3dn42t,ACSimeon,3,Fri Jul 17 17:03:30 2015 UTC,He was
whitesox,3dn7cz,chisoxbot,14,Fri Jul 17 17:14:29 2015 UTC,Hi I'm just visiting from /r/motorcitykitties since y'all are playing the Royals. Just wanted to extend my thanks to Soto for homering and that I probably hate the Sox the least out of all the teams in the division!  EDIT: I love Hawk
whitesox,3dn7cz,ChurroTigerTime,5,Fri Jul 17 19:05:24 2015 UTC,Thanks for the kind words. I had a lotta fun checking in over with you guys last time we faced off. Bunch of class acts over there. Keep up the great work. God bless.
whitesox,3dn7cz,Petey_Peppers,5,Fri Jul 17 19:06:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Hope you have a great rest of your day Petey_Peppers, and hope you sweep the doubleheader!   Also, I love your guys' subreddit. Nicely done."
whitesox,3dn7cz,ChurroTigerTime,2,Fri Jul 17 19:07:23 2015 UTC,"Hawk sucks, fuck the Tigers, and eat a big bag of crap while you're at it.   /with love"
whitesox,3dn7cz,4cornerhustler,8,Fri Jul 17 19:48:03 2015 UTC,Remember the good ol days when we used to be a home run hitting team? I miss that.
whitesox,3dn7cz,NineduceXII,11,Fri Jul 17 18:30:43 2015 UTC,Pepperidge farm remembers
whitesox,3dn7cz,drinkbeerneverfear,6,Fri Jul 17 18:37:45 2015 UTC,"Jesus, that was an awful tag. This is why White Sox pitchers' FIP is much lower than their ERA. God awful defense."
whitesox,3dn7cz,RushLimbaughIsFat,6,Fri Jul 17 19:52:23 2015 UTC,Fucking typical. Goddamnit.
whitesox,3dn7cz,RushLimbaughIsFat,3,Fri Jul 17 20:05:29 2015 UTC,yup
whitesox,3dn7cz,a1nubsauce,6,Fri Jul 17 20:05:38 2015 UTC,This team has perfected the ol' 1 on 0 out -> 0 on 2 out.
whitesox,3dn7cz,reekorse,3,Fri Jul 17 18:28:07 2015 UTC,Also the bases loaded no out no runs.
whitesox,3dn7cz,NineduceXII,3,Fri Jul 17 18:29:00 2015 UTC,I call that the White Sox special
whitesox,3dn7cz,KJzero9,6,Fri Jul 17 18:44:17 2015 UTC,Hey Soto did something!
whitesox,3dn7cz,Aperture-Employee,5,Fri Jul 17 19:03:28 2015 UTC,LOL Scotty Pods bobblehead coming up Aug 1st.  That'll bring em out.
whitesox,3dn7cz,Meatmehalfway,4,Fri Jul 17 18:41:26 2015 UTC,White Sox offense vs. Royals bullpen.  This is going to be short.
whitesox,3dn7cz,RushLimbaughIsFat,4,Fri Jul 17 19:59:13 2015 UTC,"I'm here by a Giants fan, he's just here to watch the Royals lose."

whitesox,3dn7cz,RushLimbaughIsFat,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:05:43 2015 UTC,Soto?
whitesox,3dn7cz,samlincoln,2,Fri Jul 17 20:06:22 2015 UTC,"He's given us some great years and I respect the hell out of him, but he's out of gas. He shouldn't be playing every day."
whitesox,3dn7cz,gotpez,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:14:36 2015 UTC,They need to buy him out this winter and get him all the way the fuck out of here. So tired of this dude.
whitesox,3dn7cz,BlxckLikeMe,4,Fri Jul 17 20:11:25 2015 UTC,"Don't worry, LaRoche is here to save the day."
whitesox,3dn7cz,Georgie56,4,Fri Jul 17 20:03:56 2015 UTC,Watch him get his first HR
whitesox,3dn7cz,Meatmehalfway,8,Fri Jul 17 20:55:27 2015 UTC,The real push to see if we are contenders or just gonna roll over begins today. Heres to hoping that second half is much better than our first!
whitesox,3dn7cz,drinkbeerneverfear,3,Fri Jul 17 17:27:46 2015 UTC,Looked like he tagged him after he touched the bag. Whatever.
whitesox,3dn7cz,NineduceXII,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:28:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah I wish that one got looked at, on replay it looked like the glove hit between Eaton's hands"
whitesox,3dn7cz,Aperture-Employee,3,Fri Jul 17 18:29:26 2015 UTC,Soto!!
whitesox,3dn7cz,Meatmehalfway,3,Fri Jul 17 19:03:45 2015 UTC,Tie Ballgame!!!!
whitesox,3dn7cz,drinkbeerneverfear,3,Fri Jul 17 19:04:04 2015 UTC,Soto was a monster in 2008 -2009.  Not quite the same man but he's a better hitter than Flowers in my opinion.
whitesox,3dn7cz,Meatmehalfway,3,Fri Jul 17 19:05:17 2015 UTC,I like Saladino.
whitesox,3dn7cz,Meatmehalfway,2,Fri Jul 17 19:36:03 2015 UTC,He's a stud.
whitesox,3dn7cz,Petey_Peppers,3,Fri Jul 17 19:50:21 2015 UTC,"Goddamnit, why are the Royals so good?"
whitesox,3dn7cz,RushLimbaughIsFat,3,Fri Jul 17 19:40:44 2015 UTC,"Looks like we're gonna need to score at least three runs today, oh boy."
whitesox,3dn7cz,livelyracc00n,3,Fri Jul 17 19:42:15 2015 UTC,Why does Eaton have 7 homers?
whitesox,3dn7cz,RushLimbaughIsFat,3,Fri Jul 17 19:48:00 2015 UTC,One time Adam.
whitesox,3dn7cz,Meatmehalfway,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:03:06 2015 UTC,Ha I didn't even see your comment.
whitesox,3dn7cz,samlincoln,3,Fri Jul 17 20:05:02 2015 UTC,Terrible
whitesox,3dn7cz,Meatmehalfway,3,Fri Jul 17 20:05:39 2015 UTC,Wow OBP under .200 last 2 months against righties for Alexei.
whitesox,3dn7cz,samlincoln,3,Fri Jul 17 20:06:09 2015 UTC,I've been saying they need to sit his ass.
whitesox,3dn7cz,Meatmehalfway,3,Fri Jul 17 20:06:42 2015 UTC,I was calling for us to keep him in the offseason but now I really wish he was dealt.
whitesox,3dn7cz,samlincoln,2,Fri Jul 17 20:07:31 2015 UTC,"Stone says not only is his average is under .200 against right-handers, but his OBP is lower than .200 against right-handers. Jesus Christ."
whitesox,3dn7cz,RushLimbaughIsFat,3,Fri Jul 17 20:07:09 2015 UTC,I've still got a real good feeling about this game.
whitesox,3dn7cz,Petey_Peppers,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:08:38 2015 UTC,Think we'll get to the Royals elite bullpen? Who will get it done?
whitesox,3dn7cz,samlincoln,2,Fri Jul 17 20:10:15 2015 UTC,I don't have a hero in mind. I just feel like this team is going to get it done. Been feeling that way since I woke up.
whitesox,3dn7cz,Petey_Peppers,3,Fri Jul 17 20:12:16 2015 UTC,Ramirez has been so useless :/
whitesox,3dn7cz,Vinterm,3,Fri Jul 17 20:09:22 2015 UTC,Guys. This offense is fucking infuriating to watch.
whitesox,3dn7cz,KeepItReal247365,2,Fri Jul 17 20:24:03 2015 UTC,We just know that a 4-2 lead is insurmountable. Watching for a miracle.
whitesox,3dn7cz,samlincoln,3,Fri Jul 17 20:30:28 2015 UTC,Oh shit Dan Jennings sighting lol.
whitesox,3dn7cz,samlincoln,3,Fri Jul 17 20:29:16 2015 UTC,Get the Royals out of the Central. They kill us every time.
whitesox,3dn7cz,Georgie56,3,Fri Jul 17 20:43:59 2015 UTC,Even when they were mediocre they helped knock us out in 2012.
whitesox,3dn7cz,samlincoln,3,Fri Jul 17 20:47:09 2015 UTC,Let's get SHUCK'D
whitesox,3dn7cz,thom_weights,3,Fri Jul 17 20:53:52 2015 UTC,The guys got an incredible amount of hustle.
whitesox,3dn7cz,Petey_Peppers,2,Fri Jul 17 20:54:54 2015 UTC,indeed.
whitesox,3dn7cz,demerdar,3,Fri Jul 17 20:54:40 2015 UTC,"This one hurt.   Well, let's go win tonight and keep on winning for awhile."
whitesox,3dn7cz,Petey_Peppers,4,Fri Jul 17 20:56:21 2015 UTC,This game just feels like one of those games. No way we lose.
whitesox,3dn7cz,Petey_Peppers,2,Fri Jul 17 18:55:37 2015 UTC,Shark getting us off to a great start again...
whitesox,3dn7cz,reekorse,2,Fri Jul 17 18:19:16 2015 UTC,"Alright, 4+ run inning here."
whitesox,3dn7cz,samlincoln,2,Fri Jul 17 18:22:47 2015 UTC,Ugh
whitesox,3dn7cz,samlincoln,2,Fri Jul 17 18:27:05 2015 UTC,Why does your catcher throw the ball back to the pitcher like that???
whitesox,3dn7cz,AndrewNava,8,Fri Jul 17 19:21:33 2015 UTC,Why doesn't yours?
whitesox,3dn7cz,JROremus,2,Fri Jul 17 19:26:40 2015 UTC,Idk :( it looks so weird though lol
whitesox,3dn7cz,AndrewNava,3,Fri Jul 17 19:28:35 2015 UTC,Yeah I don't really know if anybody knows why. It's definitely odd though.
whitesox,3dn7cz,JROremus,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:30:29 2015 UTC,Some form of the yips is the best guess
whitesox,3dn7cz,constapatedape,2,Fri Jul 17 21:32:23 2015 UTC,It's a superstition.
whitesox,3dn7cz,chocoholicsoxfan,2,Fri Jul 17 19:32:19 2015 UTC,7 walks total in 4 innings?! wtf pitchers
whitesox,3dn7cz,titomb345,2,Fri Jul 17 19:31:50 2015 UTC,That's just something you can't have happen. Fuckin shark.
whitesox,3dn7cz,NineduceXII,2,Fri Jul 17 19:43:08 2015 UTC,STIR THAT MOTHERFUCKER
whitesox,3dn7cz,thom_weights,2,Fri Jul 17 19:46:04 2015 UTC,THAT'S MY BOY
whitesox,3dn7cz,livelyracc00n,2,Fri Jul 17 19:46:18 2015 UTC,What a game!!
whitesox,3dn7cz,Meatmehalfway,2,Fri Jul 17 19:46:25 2015 UTC,"I have no idea why Eaton is hitting home runs, but ill take it."
whitesox,3dn7cz,lostmessage256,2,Fri Jul 17 19:49:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks, Shark."
whitesox,3dn7cz,titomb345,2,Fri Jul 17 19:56:15 2015 UTC,Inning would be over if Ramirez tagged out Hosmer. This is why we lose games.
whitesox,3dn7cz,RushLimbaughIsFat,2,Fri Jul 17 19:57:44 2015 UTC,Ok Don't stop now boys
whitesox,3dn7cz,a1nubsauce,2,Fri Jul 17 20:03:33 2015 UTC,Back to White Sox baseball.
whitesox,3dn7cz,samlincoln,2,Fri Jul 17 20:08:35 2015 UTC,Same shit different out
whitesox,3dn7cz,drinkbeerneverfear,2,Fri Jul 17 20:08:49 2015 UTC,You can't get one freaking run there?!
whitesox,3dn7cz,Meatmehalfway,2,Fri Jul 17 20:09:21 2015 UTC,Trade deadline fast approaching. Who are we giving away?
whitesox,3dn7cz,Georgie56,3,Fri Jul 17 20:10:44 2015 UTC,Trade Shark for a decent infielder that can hit above 250
whitesox,3dn7cz,Meatmehalfway,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:12:21 2015 UTC,"We might have one in Saladino. Too soon, but we might."
whitesox,3dn7cz,samlincoln,2,Fri Jul 17 20:21:19 2015 UTC,Need more.
whitesox,3dn7cz,Meatmehalfway,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:23:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, good thing Tim Anderson, Trey Michalczewski, and even Johnson, are our best minor league hitters and all infielders. If you trust the org to develop good position players though it's not gonna happen. I wonder what caliber player Shark would get us."
whitesox,3dn7cz,samlincoln,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:25:56 2015 UTC,Yeah you are right and I'm hoping both Tim and Micah come up later this year.  Still need a bat though and Shark can bring us one back for sure.
whitesox,3dn7cz,Meatmehalfway,2,Fri Jul 17 20:38:30 2015 UTC,Well we could've got something back for Alexei last year...this year we could trade him maybe for a sack of baseballs. Hopefully
whitesox,3dn7cz,KeepItReal247365,2,Fri Jul 17 20:11:40 2015 UTC,O boy Hawks iPad got a mention

whitesox,3dn7cz,samlincoln,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:22:46 2015 UTC,So what is the main reason for bringing up Saladino (like it so far)? Is Gillaspie hurting at all or are we just sick of our current 3B situation?
whitesox,3dn7cz,PatrickBateman1,3,Fri Jul 17 20:24:19 2015 UTC,I think Gilaspie had a foot problem (plantar fasciitis which is very nagging) all year. I think Conor is actually a good hitter that's been playing hurt all year. Give him his rest.
whitesox,3dn7cz,samlincoln,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:27:49 2015 UTC,I don't know if I'd call Conor Gillaspie a good hitter.
whitesox,3dn7cz,JROremus,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:32:57 2015 UTC,He was pretty deec for the first half of last year.
whitesox,3dn7cz,Mrslinger85,2,Fri Jul 17 20:33:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and was abysmal the second half. He hasn't done a single thing to prove that the first half of 2014 was the true him. He rode a BABIP of .370 in the first half for an average of .326. He's decent at best, but I would never call him good."
whitesox,3dn7cz,JROremus,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:36:03 2015 UTC,I just like his swing.
whitesox,3dn7cz,samlincoln,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:40:25 2015 UTC,"Him hitting .282 last year was very good considering his expectations. I'd say ""good"" is relative to what we expect from him.  I don't really expect anything from him though. Plus he's not good at third."
whitesox,3dn7cz,PatrickBateman1,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:37:19 2015 UTC,"His .282 was boosted by a ridiculous BABIP of .370 in the first half. He hit .326 the first half and .228 the second half. If it wasn't for his lucky first half he would probably have hit around .250.   Maybe some consider him good, but a guy who is going to hit .250 realistically and can't hit left handed pitching isn't that good to me."
whitesox,3dn7cz,JROremus,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:39:50 2015 UTC,He's better than Davidson. I've been saying that ever since the Reed trade.
whitesox,3dn7cz,samlincoln,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:45:34 2015 UTC,"Better than Davidson =/= good. I don't hate Gillaspie, but he's simply not a good enough player to be a major league starter. He's best used as part of a platoon only playing against righties, but even then you have to deal with his awful defense.   Not saying Davison is the answer, but Gillaspie isn't either. They really need to make getting a good at or near the top of their future priority list."
whitesox,3dn7cz,JROremus,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:51:10 2015 UTC,"That is true. Gillaspie's defense is what really keeps him from being a viable option for me. I do miss the little bit of hitting he could do though, and I like the mechanics on his swing when he's healthy I'm optimistic for him."
whitesox,3dn7cz,samlincoln,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:52:59 2015 UTC,Yeah he's worse this year. .282 is fine with how much we struggle on offense.

whitesox,3di565,RDT2,-5,Fri Jul 17 00:34:22 2015 UTC,I don't mind 670 The Score
whitesox,3dj88m,ACSimeon,3,Thu Jul 16 18:35:19 2015 UTC,Turned it off right after I heard him say he'd be happy if the Cubs won the World Series; jaysus.
whitesox,3dj88m,WSOXFAN22,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:10:20 2015 UTC,I would be happy for the Cubs fans & the players on the team. I don't want the Ricketts to win anything except a shit sandwich and a kick in the balls though.
whitesox,3dj88m,WSOXFAN22,5,Thu Jul 16 20:44:00 2015 UTC,"Why would you be happy for them?  Here's how I view the Cubs - I'm not some big meatball, but I can't stand the organization. Sports is about passion - fan is merely short for fanatic after all. No one roots for their rivals; the Cubs are Rivals of the White Sox on an entirely different level. We fight for viewership, fans, money and the entire Chicago market.   Do you think North Carolina fans don't care if Duke wins? Do you think the Dodgers root for the Giants? Obviously they do not. That doesn't make anyone an idiot meatball, it makes them a true fan of their team. The Cubs are a genuine threat to the White Sox; there have been threats of leaving Chicago before, and that is solely based on the marketshare the Cubs claim by being complete losers.  No clue why you'd be happy for our number one competition."
whitesox,3dj88m,baraksobamas,2,Thu Jul 16 21:07:07 2015 UTC,"Duke/North Carolina & Dodgers/Giants play in the same conference. I'm always dreaming that we'll get to beat the Cubs in the World Series, just like in 1906.  If our biggest rival sucks, then it isn't much of a rivalry, is it?  You don't have to tell me that the Cubs are shitty. I literally pass Wrigley Field by to get to White Sox games, but I still try to be kind of happy for my friends & family that make the dire mistake of being Cubs fans.  We're not stealing fans from them by being dicks."
whitesox,3dj88m,baraksobamas,2,Thu Jul 16 21:32:38 2015 UTC,"It is not a rivalry based on competition. It is based on life. The cubs being good does not force the Sox to get better to keep up with them because they don't play enough. The cubs being good takes needed attention, finances and resources directly away from the Sox."
whitesox,3dj88m,baraksobamas,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:10:24 2015 UTC,"Forces the Sox to be better then, doesn't it?  Cubs are a team I love to hate, but we gotta steal their fans if you care about those finances and resources. White Sox are still better than the Cubs when the Sox underspend comparatively."

I understand showing you my drivers license, whatever, but to ask to see a second firm of ID is absolutely absurd. They used to have a sign out front after I had that experience that said they require two firms of ID. I've never seen this anywhere else. I avoid them at all costs ever since."

whitesox,3diiqw,QEDomelets,2,Thu Jul 16 15:35:11 2015 UTC,That kinda what I'm afraid of. 6 games closer to the deadline with no real solution :\

whitesox,3diiqw,Petey_Peppers,7,Thu Jul 16 17:13:57 2015 UTC,6-0  We'll be trading for a bat at the deadline. Best pitching in the league. This is shaping up to be one of the most dramatic 2nd half comebacks in baseball history. Kudos to Rick Hahn. He's put together a hell of a team. Hell of a team.

whitesox,3diiqw,99levtt,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:16:26 2015 UTC,"Well I believe Samardzija and Danks will pitch the St. Louis series, so assume a split there. Best case scenario we win 3/4 against KC so the optimistic look is 4-2, but the realistic look is either a split or 2-4.  Edit: Rodon and Samardzija I believe, so that's better against St. Louis. The rest rings true, I just believe we are more likely to split than go 2-4 knowing Danks won't pitch. Totally forgot about Rodon for some reason. Hopefully that blister is better."
whitesox,3diiqw,Mrslinger85,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:28:37 2015 UTC,Why isn't Sale pitching against KC?

whitesox,3dfa1p,knightni73,5,Wed Jul 15 20:32:25 2015 UTC,One of the top prospects*
whitesox,3dfa1p,k5therobot,5,Wed Jul 15 20:41:52 2015 UTC,He was a toss in on the garcia-peavy trade. Good to see he might pan out. The Sox are great at developing pitching and so bad at developing hitting.  I wonder if we should just strictly draft pitching and trade it for major league ready hitters after they improve a bit..
whitesox,3dfa1p,ACSimeon,2,Thu Jul 16 00:07:04 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be mad if we traded Quintana. I think he has a ceiling lower than Rodon and Fulmer's, but an impossibly high trade value right now. He might even get us a better return than Samardzija."
whitesox,3dfa1p,k5therobot,3,Thu Jul 16 02:10:22 2015 UTC,I imagine he would get way more then shark. Far more valuable. He had the twelfth most fwar out of pitchers from 2013-2014. Just ahead of bumgarner  edit: might be 2013-2015 or 2012-2014. I have to double check later but his stats put him in the top 20 pitchers in the game.
whitesox,3dfa1p,ACSimeon,3,Thu Jul 16 02:15:18 2015 UTC,Quintana's younger and his contract could be more desirable because it's not a rental.
whitesox,3dfa1p,BBS-,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:24:49 2015 UTC,"That's pretty much what we've been trying to do lately, with exception of Tim Anderson, who actually has been doing good."

whitesox,3dg5cf,callmeroo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:01:02 2015 UTC,I second this. Best value in the park. Or if you can get first row upper in the infield that is good too.

whitesox,3dg5cf,SlagginOff,3,Thu Jul 16 14:58:26 2015 UTC,"You can get into the bullpen bar with upper deck tickets. If you have the time to get there 2-3 hours before game time, the bar is a good place to watch, but patio seating is first come first serve."

Two things: 1.)whitesox.com lets you see what seats are available, you can scope out available seats right up until game time 2.) The ushers leave the top of the section and walk down to the bottom of the section during inning breaks. There is no one there to check your ticket. Move then."

He's too young, too good, and on a sweetheart deal for his entire prime."
whitesox,3ddwj1,JROremus,10,Wed Jul 15 15:24:25 2015 UTC,I have seen a good amount of forum posts about this on different message boards. The best argument I heard was that no team really has the prospects necessary to get him but if you throw in dead weight you can reduce the value until its fair. Something like Corey Seager and Julio Urias for Sale then you throw in danks awful contract and dump Laroche and Melky. This was about a month ago when Melky was doing much worse.  The talent to contract ratio on Chris Sale is so amazing that you really have to get creative to figure out how it would happen.
whitesox,3ddwj1,k5therobot,4,Wed Jul 15 15:12:03 2015 UTC,"I really think that even if you dumped all 3 of the people you listed it still isn't fair. LaRoche and Danks will both be gone after next year and Melky the year after.  To me, they would almost have to make the playoffs in 2016 and 2017 to justify trading Sale in that situation, because if they missed the playoffs those two years anyway all they really did was trade Sale for no reason."
whitesox,3ddwj1,JROremus,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:23:02 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. I just really despise Danks and hope if they do make a trade they get rid of him in the process.  Sale has said that money is not what he cares for, that he already has way more than he needs. I know players say that all the time but seeing the current deal he took and how he doesn't seem to care that a closer makes way more than he does, it's entirely possible that the sox can get him to sign an extension towards the end of this deal. He will probably be way more expensive, but not free agent prices."
whitesox,3ddwj1,k5therobot,8,Wed Jul 15 15:58:11 2015 UTC,The Sox would want at least two top prospects AND a pile of cash. Chris sale is fully under club control until 2019. You would need a kings randsom to move him
whitesox,3ddwj1,plaqston,6,Wed Jul 15 14:47:49 2015 UTC,"To me he would also require an ML ready pitcher to replace him, among the others you said. He is a rare talent and arguably the best pitcher in the game, and he has the best contract in sports right now. Even the Cubs couldn't afford him"

whitesox,3ddwj1,SteelyDan68,2,Wed Jul 15 21:37:54 2015 UTC,"With Sale's talent, potential, and contract situation, a team with a good to great farm system would pretty much have to deplete their resources to land him. In a few years, his contract situation changes, the price will go down, but right now....I honestly don't think a team could afford to give up all the talent it would take to land Sale. With all his positives, I think he's essentially untradeable unless the Sox are willing to take less than what they should get for him. I don't think they'll do that."
whitesox,3ddwj1,dewgazi,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:25:45 2015 UTC,"There isn't a team ready and willing to give up true value for Sale. You're talking about an ace lefty with arguably the most friendly contract in the bigs. As someone else mentioned, they'd have to take on Danks's contract, throw in some MLB ready players, and then their 2-3 top prospects.    He would bring in a haul for sure but I don't see the Sox pulling the trigger. I think Quintana is more likely to go."
whitesox,3ddwj1,ggslovin,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:34:40 2015 UTC,non-starter. Why do you think King Felix never went anywhere.
whitesox,3ddwj1,btmalon,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:46:12 2015 UTC,"It will be a couple years before any trade would happen. As the team control gets shorter and the mileage builds up on his arm, his value would lower to the point where a team might be willing to give up his worth.  As of now, trading for him would mean gutting your farm system and probably some important players on your MLB team. I don't see any contenders doing that.  The hypothetical team would have to be a team on the brink that doesn't have very many untouchable everyday MLB lineup guys, but does have enough ""untouchable"" elite prospects that losing 3-4 of them wouldn't kill their farm system."
whitesox,3ddwj1,Moses_Scurry,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:49:43 2015 UTC,"My issue with the concept of moving Sale is, why would we? He has a very team friendly contract, he's a dominating left handed starter - arguably has the best stuff in the majors, and even if we do end up throwing up the white flag and building for the future, he's young enough and under team control, to be part of that future.  I just don't see any scenario where we would win by moving him.   Maybe this is just me looking through rose colored glasses, but what Sale is on and off the field is the definition of a ball player.   Let's hope this break gave our guys some time to reflect on the abysmal first half and get the bats going. We're too good (on paper) to be sitting where we're at. Sit back, relax and strap it down."

whitesox,3dbvx3,jmorlin,2,Wed Jul 15 23:36:52 2015 UTC,Does this still hold true if the Sox trade Samardzija?
whitesox,3dbvx3,callmeroo,3,Wed Jul 15 04:30:34 2015 UTC,I think so. If they do trade him I think that Erik Johnson will come up and be a stud.
whitesox,3dbvx3,ricker182,2,Wed Jul 15 04:54:57 2015 UTC,He was a dud last time. Won't believe it until I see it.
whitesox,3dbvx3,ACSimeon,2,Thu Jul 16 15:06:21 2015 UTC,"They're not trading Samardzija. They actually invested in him, a lot more than they did with Cabrera and LaRoche. Jeff could still pay dividends this season."
whitesox,3dbvx3,DomCaboose,3,Wed Jul 15 05:07:31 2015 UTC,"He could pay dividends this season, but he will still command a 9 figure salary, even with the shitty start he had to the season."

While I don't think it will matter, if they end up making a run at it Sale having more starts will be more important than pitching one inning of an exhibition it looks like they'll win anyway.  That being said if he did pitch it would still be cool, but I don't care either way."

whitesox,3dbvx3,ace05,3,Wed Jul 15 02:56:18 2015 UTC,It was an incredible piece of hitting by Trouty - it was a great pitch. Low and away change up with 2 strikes and Trout just got out there and crushed it. Nothing you can do there.
whitesox,3dbvx3,ArtisticGuy,2,Wed Jul 15 18:15:51 2015 UTC,"The pitch to Trout was perfect. The preceding pitches that loaded up the bases were not. If he crushed a solo or two run, it wouldn't have been so bad.   But then again, this is the 2014 bullpen.  Even still."

Who cares if our ace pitches in the all-star game or not, what is important is he is rested for games THAT MATTER.

whitesox,3dbvx3,AnDEErew,0,Wed Jul 15 04:37:49 2015 UTC,"Not really. If he got hurt right before a big 4-game series with the Royals, I'd assume it was the antics of Ned Yost."

whitesox,3dbvx3,AnDEErew,0,Wed Jul 15 02:24:51 2015 UTC,"The most dominant pitcher in baseball isn't pitching in the all-star game because his manager is a moron. If the Sox resign him after all his awful years, i'm not sure if I could bring myself to watch another White Sox game."

I mean, I love Paulie a lot, but is he one of the four players who represents our franchise most for a team that's been playing for well over a century?  Doubtful. I'd have sooner seen Shoeless Joe Jackson in."
whitesox,3dc6dy,chocoholicsoxfan,5,Wed Jul 15 03:25:25 2015 UTC,"Agreed. To me Baines and Konerko shouldn't be on the list and Minoso is debatable. There's been a lot of great players on the Sox over the years like Aparacio, Appling, Fox, Fisk, Lyons, etc.   Like you said more recent players will always be in people's minds, but it sucks there is no sense of history. Maybe that's partly on the fault of the team, but this was a sad list in my opinion.  Edit: Apparently listed Fisk twice"

whitesox,3dc6dy,AnniesBoobzz,6,Thu Jul 16 15:02:16 2015 UTC,"I don't agree with Baines or even Konerko being on the list. Minoso and Thomas seem unquestionable to me. Granted I'm a younger fan, and my knowledge of older players (1950's and before) is limited, but I feel like there has to be two guys more deserving than Baines and Konerko. Like others said, it's largely in part due to the younger/casual fan base voting for guys they know instead of guys who actually deserve it.   I'm surprised Ed Walsh didn't get any love. Of course that's probably because he pitched in the 1900's and 1910's, but still, he seems more than deserving."

The Wrigley area (Lake View) has 7 times as many residents, too.  Still, The Cell is safe. Every team has their asshole fans, but the only time I really saw a problem was a couple years ago at an A's game. A couple A's fans had gotten outfield seats, and they were minding their own business. The Sox took the lead and a few Sox fans wanted to brag, so they were yelling things to the A's fans. About 10 times as many Sox fans starting yelling at their ""fellow"" Sox fans to shut up, and that was that."

CWB sensationalizes and highlights literally every reported crime that happens in Wrigleyville or Boystown. It's a blog created specifically for that purpose. Anyone reading it regularly will get a vastly inflated picture of the danger here.  Also, random strangers get mugged all the time ANYWHERE IN CHICAGO if they're drunk and stumbling home at 3am. Criminals target people like that all over town. Not stumbling home at 3am while drunk is up there with locking your front door on 'obvious steps to avoid being attacked by criminals'.  It's not an epidemic here. You're in much greater danger at 11pm in Uptown, and in much much more danger if you're in most parts of the South Side."

The park should have been on the east and the projects on the west. This would have made a continuous area from the University of Chicago all the way up to the loop that was attractive to people. Instead they put it not only west of the expressway but south of the old park without clearing the public housing from the south of the new park. Now you have a new park with rail freight lines to the west, projects to the south closer than most of the parking, expressway to the east and the nearest neighborhood to the north being chinatown. Tack on no L stop until recently, the park facing southeast having only high rise housing projects in view, upper decks that terrified people and traffic jams getting in and out of the lots so bad they blocked up the only ways out for miles. Charge 20$ for limited safe parking in the 90s and most of the fans couldnt get to the game if they wanted to. Let alone stay around and stare at railcars. Also the lighting in the viaducts is still so poor it look scarier than if they weren't on at all.  Put the current park on the other side of the expressway originally, and the White Sox are selling out every game while wrigleyville is still the shithole that it was in the 70s.

whitesox,3d44c3,KJzero9,2,Mon Jul 13 18:55:33 2015 UTC,"I was going to say I don't know why you're being down voted, but I do know why. You're still right. All those other fancy stats and the eye test say Sale is either at the top or very very near it. However we aren't voting for the Cy Young. People who care about those stats you listed are.   So if it came down to it today, I don't think Sale would win."
whitesox,3d44c3,ricker182,5,Mon Jul 13 23:06:14 2015 UTC,"What about WHIP? and SO/9. Those are also big ones.     If Sale is behind in ERA AND wins, he won't win the CY."
whitesox,3d44c3,jpgonzo24,6,Mon Jul 13 15:26:28 2015 UTC,Wins are completely irrelevant.
whitesox,3d44c3,ricker182,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:59:24 2015 UTC,Not in CY voting. I agree though that it's not a good stat to measure a pitcher on. It's actually one of the worst.     My favorite is WHIP.
whitesox,3d44c3,RushLimbaughIsFat,5,Mon Jul 13 22:41:37 2015 UTC,"I keep saying this, but Felix Hernandez won in 2010 with a 13-12 record."
whitesox,3d44c3,Spaaace_Ghooost,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:00:48 2015 UTC,That's one of the few outliers though. Chris Sale still has a good chance to win the Cy Young but not having a lower ERA and more wins hurts him.
whitesox,3d44c3,huphelmeyer,4,Mon Jul 13 21:27:38 2015 UTC,"Right. And if the Sox remain in last place, that will also cost him votes unfortunately."
whitesox,3d44c3,ricker182,4,Mon Jul 13 15:34:17 2015 UTC,Also probably true.
whitesox,3d44c3,jpgonzo24,5,Mon Jul 13 15:34:40 2015 UTC,The CY has is not dependent on team performance much like the MVP often is.
whitesox,3d44c3,ACSimeon,3,Mon Jul 13 16:00:12 2015 UTC,"That's a big if. Kluber won last year, and the Indians are perpetual garbage."
whitesox,3d44c3,huphelmeyer,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:33:05 2015 UTC,"I agree that team standings is less of a factor for CY than MVP.  But in 2014 Kluber was tied for most wins with Sherzer and Weaver. Among those three, Kluber also had the lowest ERA, most IPs, most Ks, and fewest ERs.   I'm not trying to rain on anyone's parade. Sale is a huge silver lining in an otherwise crappy season. He's still in the running for CY, but he won't win if he's trailing the same player in both ERA and Ws at the end of the season.  You can rightfully call those stats misleading or even meaningless, but it's what the voters value."
whitesox,3d44c3,ACSimeon,2,Mon Jul 13 16:42:30 2015 UTC,"If the voters want to live to see 2016, they won't undervalue Chris Sale in 2015 lol."
whitesox,3d44c3,JROremus,2,Mon Jul 13 16:52:36 2015 UTC,That didn't stop Félix Hernández from winning the 2010 Cy Young on a team with 101 losses.

whitesox,3d1avf,Meatmehalfway,2,Sun Jul 12 20:24:24 2015 UTC,"Because I deem Sale, Rodon, Quintana, and pretty much the entire pitching staff except for Shark as un-tradeable.  We finally have a good staff top to bottom and there's no need to mess with it.    And then we have contracts that nobody will touch.  And then we have players who just suck.   We gotta make due, for this season, with what we got."
whitesox,3d1avf,Meatmehalfway,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:27:20 2015 UTC,"And I don't want to trade Shark this year if we are playing well because we don't have his replacement yet.  Maybe next year we will have Johnson and later on Fulmer but as of right now, we give up if we trade Shark."

whitesox,3d1avf,Meatmehalfway,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:52:53 2015 UTC,That's why I think they will be fine if they just find one or two more bats.  If they start losing then hopefully Shark will bring one back.  Then maybe find one in free agency.  I think the core of the team is set.

Well, Flowers is a catcher and is good at pitching, and Sanchez is good at defense and is in the 9 hole. Well, how about we blame the people who are suppose to swing the bats? Cabrera, Garcia, Larouche, Eaton, etc. We didn't sign Cabrera to hit .260 and Larouche to strikeout all the time."
whitesox,3d1avf,gotpez,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:39:22 2015 UTC,Cabrera's been getting better. Laroche is ass and the second coming of Dunn. But I think people are overlooking Abreu's regression from last year. Last year he was hitting so well that he could carry an offense and this year he isn't. He's by far our best hitter and isn't putting up the numbers he's capable of.
whitesox,3d1avf,RushLimbaughIsFat,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:21:04 2015 UTC,"You're right that Abreu isn't putting up the numbers like last year. The thing is, I think maybe since there is no leadership now, and the team hasn't really functioned as well, I think maybe it's affecting him. However, this is speculative, so we don't know. Abreu was a monster last year, but a .835 OPS isn't anything to be ashamed of.   Edit: Also, maybe being new from Cuba affected his performace last year, since he was determined to prove himself, and establish himself on the team. But this is even more speculation. But it reminded me of Yasiel Puig how he regressed. While Puig is still great, he isn't as good as he was his rookie year."
whitesox,3d1avf,gotpez,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:59:40 2015 UTC,"Yes, theres a ton of factors. Maybe managers have figured out his weaknesses and how to pitch to him. But my point being that an .835 OPS isn't capable of carrying a lineup filled with guys struggling to hit .250. If he had 20 homers right now instead of 14 maybe we'd have won a few more close ballgames"
whitesox,3d1avf,RushLimbaughIsFat,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:11:31 2015 UTC,"True. Obviously we can't blame Abreu at all for this mess. I think your idea is one of the biggest factors. He's only 28, so I think he'll bounce back next year. Every single team would take Abreu in a second, so I think we should blame the people who we payed to actually hit. Larouche, Cabrera, Eaton. People say Cabrera is heating up, but I am not sure if it makes up for his awful start. Larouche just sucks ass. Adam Dunn 2.0."

whitesox,3d1tyi,RushLimbaughIsFat,3,Sun Jul 12 21:26:08 2015 UTC,The way I see it if we start losing again then we will get a decent infielder back in a trade for Shark.  Also that means a high draft pick for next year which hopefully will be used on another good infielder. And Robin might get fired.  But if they continue to win then who knows what could happen. They will get a compensatory pick for Shark since they won't trade him and they'll probably let him go in FA.  Win win situation to me.

Outside of Abreu, the entire infield's hitting is a black hole. Cabrera and Eaton took 2 months before they began to hit, and we don't know what Avasail really is at this point. There is no depth on the bench or in the minors to fall back on. And anytime you hear the phrase ""hard working"" or ""grinder"" just means the guy is white and sucks.    The team needs to sell now and sell hard."

Whether it's a good idea or not is debatable, but it's not really working. Like why haven't the coaches told Eaton to not drag his foot across first base? There are stupid things players do that coaches need to say ""stop doing that"".   There have been players in the past brag about not picking up a bat in the off-season. I don't think that's a good thing.   If we had a tougher manager, those players would get benched."

He's not playing in the All-Star game this year, so he's going to get a big break anyways. There was no reason to rest him today unless he specifically asked for the extra day."

I think we should be buyers at the break, because even a mild improvement would be huge for this team."
whitesox,3d1ov8,reekorse,3,Mon Jul 13 03:38:24 2015 UTC,"Probably because it doesn't seem to matter. It's not like we haven't fired hitting coaches before. We're on like our 3rd or 4th hitting coach since 2011. I think it's an organizational hitting/philosophy issue and not one with any individual coach. That's something that is a lot harder to fix especially when we have an owner that refuses to mix things up when it comes to the guys running the show (ahem, KENNY)."
whitesox,3d1ov8,rhodeislandslut,3,Mon Jul 13 03:19:03 2015 UTC,Because firing the hitting coach doesn't actually do shit.

LaRoche by all accounts would rather be duck hunting.  He's a dog on the base paths and comes off as if he's butthurt about not playing 1B every day.  Melky was on juice in his ""prime"".  I don't know what other big name hitters you're talking about.  Maybe the fact is that our front office covets big splash FA signings of guys beyond their prime.  Maybe the front office evaluation skills of hitting just plain suck.  Our hitting coach did just fine with Oakland."

whitesox,3d1tux,gotpez,6,Sun Jul 12 20:58:46 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't call it clear with way. I suspect Santiago will come back down to earth and Eaton will improve. I also don't see this season as a clear indicator of their future seasons. Eaton was much better last year. Santiago has been better, so far, this year."
whitesox,3d1tux,Moses_Scurry,9,Mon Jul 13 00:11:28 2015 UTC,"I'm not a Eaton fan but this trade doesn't hurt that much. Yes, Santiago is having a good year and is a solid pitcher, but it's not like the Sox need arms.  They took a shot at a leadoff man and it still might work out. The trade that still kills me is Gio Gonzalez for that piece of garbage Swisher."
whitesox,3d1tux,mushperv,7,Sun Jul 12 22:47:38 2015 UTC,"Eaton is working out. Even though he's only hitting in the .250's he's still doing his most important job, getting on base. Plus his glove/arm in center is awesome. And his energy as well. Reminds me a lot of Podsednik. A guy like him you have to look deeper than the numbers. He was definitely worth Santiago (who I really miss but love Eaton much more).   Also, I will always hate this organization for trading Gio Gonzalez TWICE!!! Idiots!"
whitesox,3d1tux,AnniesBoobzz,3,Mon Jul 13 03:39:27 2015 UTC,"Obviously the Angels. If Santiago was still playing for the Sox, and put up very similar numbers, we wouldn't have to put out Danks. Santiago is becoming a premier pitcher.  Santiago's WAR: 2.7  Eaton's WAR: 0.8"
whitesox,3d1tux,RushLimbaughIsFat,4,Sun Jul 12 21:41:13 2015 UTC,"Honestly the main reason Danks is still in the rotation is because this dumbass FO sees his contract and thinks he HAS to stay in the rotation. They should do exactly what the Cubs did with Edwin Jackson and put that bum in the bullpen until his contract is up.   We have enough arms to compensate for Danks right now, and a few guys in the farm ready to take over once that bum is done, or the FO opens their eyes and sees that Danks shouldn't be in the rotation.   Also, Santiago is not a premier pitcher. Take one look at his advanced stats. FIP, xFIP, SIERA all show HUGE regression coming. Guy is not a sub-3.00 ERA pitcher."
whitesox,3d1tux,AnniesBoobzz,3,Mon Jul 13 03:45:06 2015 UTC,"I completely agree that Danks should be in the bullpen. And actually, it worked out well for the Cubs because Jackson has been a way better relief pitcher than a starting pitcher. So maybe Danks can do better in the pen.  Santiago's WAR is still pretty good, even though his FIP isn't great."
whitesox,3d1tux,RushLimbaughIsFat,2,Mon Jul 13 05:04:14 2015 UTC,"Ranks doesn't have the stuff anymore to be a good candidate to improve as a reliever. And his tendency to lose his command at any given time would be disastrous out of the bullpen.   Either the Sox need to be ready to give Danks a quicker hook when he loses it, or once Johnson or someone else is ready it might be time to say so long."
whitesox,3d1tux,ChrisPummer,2,Mon Jul 13 12:26:11 2015 UTC,"But Jackson had been pitching for a long time too, and he improved in the bullpen. But with Danks' contract unfortunately we don't really have a choice but to keep him on the roster."
whitesox,3d1tux,RushLimbaughIsFat,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:50:29 2015 UTC,"Jackson has better stuff. And the contract is a sunk cost. They owe Danks the money if he pitches well, pitches worse than someone else could, or doesn't pitch at all.   There's nobody the Sox have on hand that looks like a slam dunk to be better, so I'm not bent up with the Sox running him out there. I even defended the notion of leaving him there during the offseason because it was more important to invest in offense. I still think that if the Sox look for some addition in trade."
whitesox,3d1tux,ChrisPummer,4,Mon Jul 13 22:18:58 2015 UTC,So are we going to ignore last year?  Santiago's WAR: 0.5  Eaton's WAR: 5.2
whitesox,3d1tux,Unknownentity7,0,Mon Jul 13 14:21:59 2015 UTC,"Are we going to ignore the fact that we need good players now rather than later? Or the fact that Hector is going to pitch way more innings this year than last year? We didn't need Eaton's good stats last year since we didn't contend. But we need Eaton now and he's not producing, and Hector is."
whitesox,3d1tux,RushLimbaughIsFat,3,Mon Jul 13 16:54:34 2015 UTC,"Hm, seems pretty ridiculous to judge something using one stat accrued over half a season..."
whitesox,3d1tux,mattfromchicago,1 point,Mon Jul 13 10:56:55 2015 UTC,"Except that WAR is a combination of stats, and judges who has been more valuable to their team."
whitesox,3d1tux,RushLimbaughIsFat,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:48:17 2015 UTC,"Anybody who understands WAR still knows it has some severe limitations, most notably that different outlets calculate WAR differently.  FanGraphs, for instance, say that Santiago has earned only 1.6 WAR so far this year.  It's a fine metric, but quoting it and it alone, and not even a full season's worth, is utterly preposterous.  Anyways, since the trade, Eaton has earned the Sox 6.1 WAR.  Santiago has earned the Angels 3.3 WAR (both according to B-R).  Hard for me to say the Angels ""obviously"" are in the lead in this deal considering Eaton plays a premier defensive and offensive position and the Sox are desperately thin on young talent at nearly every position in the field, whereas they have so many lefthanded starters, it's almost comical at this point."
whitesox,3d1tux,mattfromchicago,0,Mon Jul 13 17:03:03 2015 UTC,"Eaton has 0 WAR according to fangraphs, and only 3 accumulated over his ENITRE CAREER, so it's not like it does him any favors. Eaton this year is not doing what he is supposed to do this year. He had 1 homerun last year, now he has 6 before the all-star break? Maybe the reason he's sucking is because he keeps swinging for the fences and failing. And Santiago can replace Danks, who has a negative WAR. The fact is that Eaton is not doing well in a year the Sox are supposed to contend, and Santiago is. Perhaps if Eaton actually performed as a leadoff hitter instead of a cleanup guy, he would definitely be more valuable than Santiago."
whitesox,3d1tux,RushLimbaughIsFat,2,Mon Jul 13 17:15:23 2015 UTC,"Jesus, are you even watching the games?  Eaton's numbers are hamstrung by that lousy April he had, but since May 1, he's hit .262/.330/.423 which is pretty acceptable production from a lead-off hitter.  For comparison's sake, Alcides Escobar, who has been leading off for Kansas City (the AL's best team), is hitting .290/.327/.372.  I mean, I can't believe anyone could be watching the Sox play this year and think the problem is that there's not enough pitching and we should sacrifice more offense for it.  If Eaton isn't here, who is the everyday starting CF?  Trayce Thompson? The guy who can barely hit in AAA?  Or go back to the days after the Rowand trade when we just trotted out any broke down, washed up veteran we could find like Darin Erstad or Rob Mackowiak?  Come on.  I'm happy that Hector is doing well for LAA, he always seemed like a genuinely good guy but he was just expendable when you already have Chris Sale and Jose Quintana and then go and add Carlos Rodon to that mix.  I'm sure the Sox would have loved to lose Danks and keep Hector, but if you want to catch a fish, you need to use real bait."
whitesox,3d1tux,mattfromchicago,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:28:25 2015 UTC,"Escobar had been impeded by injuries, so it's not a good comparison. Plus compared to last year, Eaton has not been performing nearly as well. You're telling me a .327 OBP is as good as .362? We didn't give him a big contract to be a mediocre leadoff hitter. He also hasn't stolen many bases, and his wRC+ is lower than most leadoff hitters.  It's funny. Have you watched Danks pitch at all? With this offense, no wonder we have lost the majority of games he's pitched. Compare Danks' ERA to Santiago's. You can't tell me that Santiago would not have won us more games. Even if Santiago's FIP is higher than his ERA, it's still significantly better than Danks,"
whitesox,3d1tux,RushLimbaughIsFat,2,Mon Jul 13 17:56:58 2015 UTC,"Eaton's contract is hardly a big one.  Even if he stinks it up the rest of the contract, the most we'd be paying him in any one season would be  a little over $8 million, hardly anything that is going to hamstring the team from making moves.  Also, you're saying the Angels are winning the trade while ignoring last year, that's not how you evaluate a trade.  So far, since the trade, Eaton has been more valuable than Santiago, that's a fact.  One half a season doesn't change that, especially considering that Santiago is unlikely to continue sporting such a low ERA.  Obviously Santiago is better than Danks, but we're not comparing those two here (a better comparison would be whoever's playing CF for us right now if we never traded Santiago)."
whitesox,3d1tux,Unknownentity7,-1,Mon Jul 13 18:14:24 2015 UTC,"8 million is a lot for a mediocre leadoff hitter. The Angels won the trade because Santiago is pitching well when they need him to. The White Sox were 73-89, but now they have a chance and Eaton isn't doing as well as he should, while the Angels are in 1st place.  But you're right about CF. The sox are ungodly incompetent at developing hitters."
whitesox,3d1tux,RushLimbaughIsFat,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:20:03 2015 UTC,"When bench players get paid $4-5 million a year, $8 million is not a lot.  That's $8 million in 2019 dollars too, which means it's more like $6-7 million today.  Right now mediocre players get paid more than $8 million anyway (the market is $8 million/1 WAR right now).  Also, you're assuming that Eaton isn't going to improve.  He was very solid throughout his minor league career, was one of the best lead-off hitters in the game last year, and has been decent at the plate since April (and had a great June).  He's had basically one terrible month since he's been here and you're ready to write him off entirely.  Even if he just keeps his stat-line since April for the rest of the contract, he'll more than earn his pay.  We have far bigger issues on this team than Adam Eaton."
whitesox,3d1tux,Unknownentity7,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:10:45 2015 UTC,"Yes, I am telling you a .327 OBP is as good as .362.  You certainly seem to understand what I am saying.  Do you actually think if the Sox had held on to Santiago that he'd actually be starting in place of Danks right now?  At any rate, I don't know how much of a difference Santiago would make in the W-L column, the Sox have scored 3 runs or less in 8 of John's 16 starts this season.  Again, I can't believe anyone watching this team can conclude the issue is the pitching.  Eaton is 26 years old and coming off a tremendous season.  This is his 2nd full year in the Majors and unfortunately he has regressed, but there is no denying he is a talented player when he is playing well.  Having watched Santiago for a few years, I still fully believe he will regress towards his career average.  He is a fine pitcher, but he is not this good.  His FIP that is over 1.50 points higher than his ERA and BABIP that is 30 points below his career average tell me very clearly that he is the benefactor of a lot of luck right now."
whitesox,3d1tux,mattfromchicago,0,Mon Jul 13 18:49:33 2015 UTC,"You said his hitting was acceptable, but his offense is below average for a leadoff hitter.  You do know there are multiple issues other than hitting right? Like the fact the bullpen sucks? Danks sucks, and Santiago's FIP is still much better than Danks. Santiago's WHIP, HR/9, SO/W, FIP, tell me the fact that his stats are better than Danks due to a lot more than luck.  Indeed Eaton is a talented player. But the reason why the Sox signed him for 5 years is so he could hit like last year, and it's been 4 months, and while his hitting has improved, you have to admit it's not near expectations."
whitesox,3d1tux,RushLimbaughIsFat,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:29:46 2015 UTC,"Pitching isn't our issue atm though, clearly. Having Danks is fine."
whitesox,3d1tux,QEDomelets,7,Sun Jul 12 22:38:33 2015 UTC,"Danks isn't fine. His WAR is -0.8, and we're paying him a shit ton."
whitesox,3d1tux,RushLimbaughIsFat,3,Mon Jul 13 00:29:14 2015 UTC,Having him is fine. Our rotation as a whole is doing great; one of the best in the league.
whitesox,3d1tux,QEDomelets,3,Mon Jul 13 00:30:40 2015 UTC,"I think we can do better, since a replacement player can do better. Maybe we can let Johnson start over Danks for once."

I doubt this is a case of Melky, Eaton, LaRoache, and Ramirez all being washed up. There is room for optimism. Finishing .500 is a great improvement over last year. Let's have something to aim for."
whitesox,3cuqwz,Vinterm,3,Sat Jul 11 01:08:47 2015 UTC,"I never said any of those guys were washed up, although you can make a case for Ramirez. But the first half of the season the hitting has been horribly inadequate. Melky is showing signs of improvement, but his OPS is still bad. The other players have shown no signs of improvement, and generally, if the entire first half of the season you have been hitting .240, you're probably not be explosive offensively the second half. This hot streak is good, but all teams go through it, and 7 of the last 8 games we have won, we have kept opponents to 2 runs or less. Ain't going to last forever."

whitesox,3cvj8m,Meatmehalfway,10,Sat Jul 11 03:13:23 2015 UTC,If the sox had an average offense they would be in serious discussion for the wild card. Offense and defense are still awful.

whitesox,3cvj8m,helpful_shawn_,5,Sat Jul 11 17:24:20 2015 UTC,Defense is going uphill thankfully.
whitesox,3cvj8m,QEDomelets,4,Sat Jul 11 04:28:07 2015 UTC,"Pitching has been lights out for most of the year, and especially recently, but the Sox organization can't focus on just one aspect of the game. Our offense is the reason we are last in the division right now, which is surprising because we have some damn good hitters in our lineup that simpy aren't producing.  We are in the bottom five for nearly every major offensive category, and dead last in a couple (runs, total bases, at-bats [though we are tied for fewest games played]).  It's not like I can confidently put the blame on the coaching staff, but maybe that's what needs to change, because many of our players were much better hitters than what they have been this year."
whitesox,3cvj8m,QEDomelets,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:41:48 2015 UTC,"I find it almost more concerning that we're dead last defensively in I think pretty much every advanced metric. Yesterday should not have seemed as impressive to us as it did, except maybe Alexei's double play."
whitesox,3cvj8m,chocoholicsoxfan,3,Sat Jul 11 15:55:55 2015 UTC,I've at least noticed a change towards better defensive play as opposed to on the offensive side.
whitesox,3cvj8m,QEDomelets,4,Sat Jul 11 15:59:00 2015 UTC,"I love Rodon, and it was a good game, but he far from shut them down. Six walks. The defense bailed him out on multiple occasions. I know it's because he's a rookie, but he still needs work on that control. Once he gets that locked down he will be a staple in this rotation."
whitesox,3cvj8m,AnniesBoobzz,4,Sat Jul 11 20:19:17 2015 UTC,"right now, the Sox starting rotation is the best in the majors even with Dank's inconsistency...but means little if the team can not score runs....how many games has this team scored 1 or few runs in??? More than I have ever seen a Sox team in over 50yrs of following them.  Hitting is woeful, the entire team is under performing again offensive wise and its killing the pitching staff"
whitesox,3cvj8m,decaturbob,4,Sat Jul 11 12:45:41 2015 UTC,"How do you figure that we're the best in the majors? Traditional metrics don't place us anywhere within sight of the top half, let alone the top few spots, and even with advanced metrics, we aren't in the top 5 staffs.

Rick Hahn sold us on a team of veterans that can hit who aren't hitting shit. The Cubs, meanwhile, are pretty middle of the pack with four youngsters who are still learning the major league game and project very highly.

whitesox,3cst1u,mattfromchicago,35,Fri Jul 10 14:12:30 2015 UTC,This is the biggest series of the year so far IMO. Winning 2 of 3 or sweeping not only puts us close to .500 before the break but also lets people know there's a team on the south side to get excited about as well. Go Sox

Has the rivalry lost a bit of its sparkle over the years? no doubt. But with the cubs new youth and the Sox unwillingness to give up, this should be an exciting series.  Say what you will about the series, but all in all I think it is great for Chicago and baseball.  GO WHITE SOX F*** THE CUBS HAPPY FRIDAY"

whitesox,3ctwa7,chocoholicsoxfan,-9,Fri Jul 10 22:41:02 2015 UTC,"Wow, the umpires have sufficiently ruined this game here today. White Sox get their run on a blatantly missed call and now 1st and 2nd with 1 out is instead runner on 1st 2 outs. Big swings in the game.   Hate to see a good baseball game completely have its integrity ruined by incompetent and bullshit umpires, regardless of the teams. I know MLB usually doesn't cancel out a game for bad umpiring, but they might need to make a decision here today. There was no MLB game played here today. This was a sham. Hopefully all fans can get their money back and the commissioner will do the right thing and play this one over. Good Lord. Is he legally blind or paid off? It can't be neither."
whitesox,3ctwa7,Marenum,7,Fri Jul 10 22:40:57 2015 UTC,"Typical Cubs fan mentality. Couldn't find a goat or an innocent fan to blame this time, could you?  Jesus, how about some fucking accountability. You were gifted walk after walk and couldn't score."

whitesox,3ctwa7,vikingrunner,11,Sat Jul 11 00:51:05 2015 UTC,Both teams have to deal with the same ump. It's fair.
whitesox,3ctwa7,haf12,7,Fri Jul 10 22:43:08 2015 UTC,I think the ump is actually Steve Bartman.
whitesox,3ctwa7,OandAlifer,9,Fri Jul 10 22:42:59 2015 UTC,try scoring on the 6 other walks.

whitesox,3ctwa7,OandAlifer,2,Fri Jul 10 22:37:39 2015 UTC,"I changed my mind on Flowers over the past month. He's not a great hitter, but he's a catcher, and he's good at pitch framing."

whitesox,3cvqa1,QEDomelets,3,Sat Jul 11 04:22:35 2015 UTC,"I have been saying for 2 months, woeful offense by the Sox will keep them as a last place team.  I haven't seen a Sox team that has been shutout or limited to 1 run in over 50yrs of following the SOx....even in the days of being the hitless wonders...and the defense has been anything but consistent.  I thought ridding the team of Dunn was huge step forward by LaRouche has been a HUGE disappointment...at least Dunn could hit homers when he wasn't striking out.  The Sox pitching is now looking at the best in the MAjors right now but without hitting and great defense they will dinish 25 games back or more.  Sad to see so many players under perform as this team has for several years"
whitesox,3cvqa1,decaturbob,2,Sat Jul 11 12:41:15 2015 UTC,"While these are very valid points, they illustrate where the Sox have been, not necessarily where they are going.  If you look at Melky's slugging numbers the last few games you will see that they are outstanding, other bats are starting to come alive as well, including Sanchez whose defence is invaluable.  We are out hitting our opponents but we are failing to score, with a lot of our hits coming with two outs."
whitesox,3cvqa1,Meatmehalfway,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:03:35 2015 UTC,"Our team batting average might be the one offensive stat that isn't in the bottom five in the league, but that's because we get hits with two outs like you said. That seems like an unfortunate pattern as opposed to an actual problem.   But while these numbers are representative of the past, they also are foreshadowing what's to come. Melky having a hot bat is not going to put the Sox in wild card contention. Sanchez is still batting about .180 last I saw. We have played more than half of our games. It's been too long."
whitesox,3cvqa1,RushLimbaughIsFat,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:37:11 2015 UTC,"they illustrate where the Sox have been, not necessarily where they are going   Yeah, the offense has only been terrible for 4 months now. Cabrera went 0 for 3 today. Melky's OPS+ is 86, and there's a reason why Sanchez is batting ninth in a bad lineup, and we are definitely not out hitting our opponents, dude.  OBP: .296 (tied 29th)  SLG: .358 (Tied for last)  wRC+: 78 (last)  And the worst stat, WAR: -4.2, the second to last team has a batting WAR of 2.3"
whitesox,3cvqa1,arsesox,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:35:15 2015 UTC,This winning streak is certainly not sustainable unless the bats wake up.

Our pitching has been exceptional, now we need the bats to come alive!   I also think if it doesn't work out with Saladino at 3rd, they'll call up Davidson.

Fills a need for us in a catching prospect and he's blocked by Russell Martin. Would make the most sense to me."
whitesox,3crpl0,AnniesBoobzz,4,Fri Jul 10 13:06:19 2015 UTC,It is a huge sellers market this trading season. The Sox should absolutely trade him and a top 100 prospect is definitely possible. I do not think we will get a top 10. I think getting Max Pentecost would be a smart move for the Sox. Trading Shark is such an obvious move I do not know how anyone can really advocate it against it. This team does not have a playoff caliber offense.
whitesox,3crpl0,k5therobot,3,Fri Jul 10 13:35:36 2015 UTC,"Here is a better post I took from /u/tdov on r/baseball:  I could see someone sending a top 50 in all baseball (so a middling farm organization's #1 or #2 prospect) prospect for Shark easily. Unlike last trade deadline, there are no rental pitchers who are 1.5 years away from FA. The only short term SP rentals who are clearly available are Cueto, Leake, Shark, Kazmir, and Dan Haren. Contenders that need SP at the deadline: Dodgers, Giants, DBacks, Pirates, Cubs, Cardinals (heh), Astros, Royals, Twins, Tigers, Yankees, Orioles, Blue Jays, Rays, and you could put Red Sox on that list as well because they're only 5 games out. Hamels has a completely different market due to the fact that he's a longer term pitching acquisition.  This really makes Shark a big target on the trade market. Dan Haren is a wild card in that he might just retire if traded so people will be very hesitant to trade for him. Kazmir just got pulled from a start so they could be worried about an injury. That really leaves the Reds players who I think will be selling.  Hahn has done fairly well on trades in the past so I hope he pulls the trigger."

That really leaves the Reds players who I think will be selling.   The Kazmir stuff is super minor and not a significant injury (triceps or something). I don't see it affecting his trade value. However, I could see the Reds holding, especially if Cueto makes the ASG, with the All Star Game being in Cincinnati and all. Reds ownership has also been hesitant to rebuild in the recent-ish past (e.g. buying on Byrd last offseason). Also Leake's been giving up a shit-ton of HRs this year."

If it turns out he was just a slow-starter this year, and he carries this team into the wild card picture (against the odds) then we really need to re-sign him."
whitesox,3cqe1b,ACSimeon,7,Fri Jul 10 03:19:52 2015 UTC,"He's gonna go to free agency and someone will pay him more than us.  It sucks but we will be fine in starting pitching for quite a while in Sale, Rodon, Quintana, Fulmer, Johnson."
whitesox,3cqe1b,Meatmehalfway,3,Thu Jul 9 23:59:35 2015 UTC,You think Fulmer will start next year?
whitesox,3cqe1b,titomb345,5,Fri Jul 10 03:24:26 2015 UTC,"I would expect him to come up mid season.  This all depends on his development.  Rodon came up quickly because there was a hole in the rotation and because he was pitching well.  Our 4 and 5 spots have been bad for years now.  I would expect the starting rotation next year to be Sale, Quintana, Rodon, Danks, Johnson to start the season.  Then somewhere along the line Fulmer will make his way up.  He could start out in the pen and stay there for a while, but if he is what they are projecting him to be then I definitely see him closing out the year as a starter."
whitesox,3cqe1b,Meatmehalfway,2,Fri Jul 10 03:30:16 2015 UTC,Sounds good to me!

whitesox,3cqe1b,ricker182,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:25:41 2015 UTC,He's more of a good pitcher
whitesox,3cqe1b,JBProds,4,Fri Jul 10 22:36:43 2015 UTC,"I'd honestly rather see him traded for a couple of possibles. He's been pitching really well, but he's still a fly ball pitcher and that doesn't bode well in USCF. Plus we need some hitters.     Just my opinion."
whitesox,3cqe1b,k5therobot,2,Fri Jul 10 01:29:45 2015 UTC,"I agree that him being a fly ball pitcher isn't going to help him, but I'm not sure if the Sox have a right-handed option that could pitch better. I've been a huge fan of Johnson since he was drafted, but I'd like to see him get another chance before we trade Shark. It was painful to watch him last season although I do believe there was something wrong with even though nothing was ever reported. He never had control issues like that."
whitesox,3cqe1b,RushLimbaughIsFat,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:04:23 2015 UTC,I think there had to be something up with him. He dominated the minors then just looked off when he got called up. I don't think he will be a dominant starter in the majors but can definitely be a back of the rotation type guy. All he really has to do is be better than Danks
whitesox,3cqe1b,ricker182,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:28:24 2015 UTC,"And he's 31. Better to trade him for a top prospect before age regresses his abilities. Let's be completely realistic: the Sox aren't going to be in 1st place in the division and we are not going to be a wild card contender with our hitting.   And i'm bothered with people saying that we should bring up Fulmer and Johnson. Fulmer needs to develop in the minors, and Johnson pitched in 5 games in the MLB. His ERA was 6.46. Not good."
whitesox,3cqe1b,RushLimbaughIsFat,2,Fri Jul 10 04:08:28 2015 UTC,"I agree with you mostly except for thinking we don't have a shot at the wildcard, because we do. Just about everyone in the AL does at this point."
whitesox,3cqe1b,Unknownentity7,2,Fri Jul 10 04:44:15 2015 UTC,"The Sox are on a hot streak right now. The Sox have won 7 of their last 9. 6 of those wins, the pitching rotation kept opposing teams to 2 runs or less. If the only way the sox can win is through spectacular pitching with no run support, that ain't going to last forever. What makes their chances even more dim is the teams they are competing with."
whitesox,3cqe1b,pohodo3,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:57:49 2015 UTC,"Johnson dominated the minors, then came up to the majors last year and mysteriously lost 4 mph on his fastball and got hammered, which continued when he got sent back down. This year his velocity is back up to normal and he's dominating again. I wouldn't put too much stock in his performance last year at this level. He's got the ability to be a #3 starter, but we just need him to be a reliable #4/5, which I have faith he can do."
whitesox,3cqe1b,titomb345,3,Sat Jul 11 19:26:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, 30 ain't that old. He's got another 3 quality years in that arm at least, but we'll probably have to re-sign him for 4 years+"
whitesox,3cqe1b,k5therobot,3,Thu Jul 9 23:10:51 2015 UTC,"Still crazy to me that we are talking about Samardzija the baseball player. The dude was a fantastic WR at Notre Dame and easily would have gone pro. Who knows what could have been? But that fact that he had the ability to go pro in two sports, and probably succeed at both.. the dude is just an athlete.   I'm impressed.  Edit: For reference, his Notre Dame accolades,  ""He emerged as a star in the 2005 season, ending the regular season with 77 catches - 15 of them for touchdowns - for 1215 yards and making numerous All-America Teams.  He set single-season school records in both receiving yardage and touchdown receptions. Samardzija caught a touchdown pass in each of Notre Dame's first eight games in 2006, giving him the school record for consecutive games with a touchdown reception. Samardzija made 78 catches for 1,017 yards and 12 touchdowns in 13 games in the 2006 season to finish as the all-time Fighting Irish leader in reception yards with 2,593."""
whitesox,3cqe1b,lazylightning89,2,Fri Jul 10 03:26:09 2015 UTC,He pitches almost 7 innings every start. His era is 4 almost on the dot and that is with a terrible defense behind him. He is a very solid #2. I imagine he wants a 100M contract though because this is his only big free agency contract. I would guess 4-6 years. This offseason will have a ton of starting pitching though so it might be cheaper.   However Jeff has said if he gets traded that won't hurt the chances of the sox resigning him. Right now it's a huge sellers market so I think they should trade him. He is pretty much the #2 target now for pitching behind cueto. Kazmirs getting pulled should help.
whitesox,3cqe1b,constapatedape,3,Fri Jul 10 03:38:11 2015 UTC,We need to trade him for an established catcher as soon as possible. What about a three team deal to get Lucroy from the Brewers? Or maybe Cervelli from the Pirates?

whitesox,3cqe1b,waff1ez,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:01:51 2015 UTC,I say we sell him now for an infielder that can hold a bat right side up. Bring up Eric Johnson to sub. He's cleaning up in triple A. Bring Micah up too. There's your winning team
whitesox,3cqe1b,k5therobot,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:41:05 2015 UTC,"If they don't trade him, I could see him sticking around for 2-3 years on a 10-12 million a year deal.  You can't assume pitchers you draft will be up the next season and you need to eat up innings.  I just hope he stays good lol"

If management has shown me one thing this year, it's that they are absolutely convinced despite all evidence that we still have an amazing team put together.  I've also heard Kenny say this is year 1 of a 3 year plan, so I don't see anyone of importance getting moved in that mindset.   I do think we have the talent where if we can actually maybe bring in some better hitting, we might be able to make a push, but we need to keep playing like we have, and I'm still skeptical. Last time this happened we went back and lost 6 in a row."

The first third is seeing what you got, the second is fixing it, the third third is letting it ride. Looks like the Sox are fixing it. This cubs series and royals one after the break will dictate what this team does at the deadline. If the Sox take 2 of 3 or all 3 at Wrigley I can see Hahn quickly changing course and looking to buy. I think the Sox will look at a third baseman if we keep this going. Montas and Erik Johnson look real good in the minors and they will be expendable if the Sox get back in it because we'll have sale, Q, Rodon, and Fulmer for many years to come, not to mention shark could be resigned. Let's enjoy this crosstown series and sweep the Cubs."
whitesox,3cr3pq,america_rex,2,Fri Jul 10 04:14:17 2015 UTC,"There is no way this team is going to be able to contend with this hitting and defense. I'm just going to say it. This pitching is great but when the team is hitting as bad as they are, and they have to compete with teams such as the Angels, Orioles, Jays, etc. the chance they are going to come out on top of the wild card race is slim."
whitesox,3cr3pq,RushLimbaughIsFat,3,Fri Jul 10 04:22:59 2015 UTC,But they can't hit this bad for this long can they?
whitesox,3cr3pq,Koneesha,2,Fri Jul 10 04:31:47 2015 UTC,"Melky is warming up, but every other player who needs to get better isn't. Ramirez hasn't gotten an RBI since june 21st. Eaton isn't hitting like a leadoff hitter. Larouche is a terrible disappointment. Beckham is like Ramirez. Sanchez is a free out. And none of these players have been changing."
whitesox,3cr3pq,RushLimbaughIsFat,2,Fri Jul 10 04:43:00 2015 UTC,"Eaton is starting to get there. Sox pitching will always give them a chance, they just need another bat. You can't play in the AL with no offensive production from 3rd base. If they can find one, they will most certainly contend for that last WC spot."
whitesox,3cr3pq,OandAlifer,2,Fri Jul 10 05:09:51 2015 UTC,"Everytime we get a bat, they seem to be a disappointment. Just look at Larouche or Cabrera. Even though Cabrera is warming up, he is no where near as good as he was last year. And your point about third base is huge. The Sox have always seemed to struggle finding good offensive third basemen.   In order to get the last WC spot, the pitching rotation can't be the only thing lifting them. 6 of the 7 games they have won in the past nine games, the pitching has kept opponents to 2 runs or less. That's not going to last."

At least try to get him to sign an extension. If he refuses then maybe trade him, but he's pitching better (2.40 ERA over his last 6 starts) and we all know how important RHP are for this current rotation. Unless they get offered something they can't refuse from teams with pretty good farm systems (TOR & HOU). Just my two cents."

He won 3 Gold Gloves and set the MLB record for consecutive games played at second base, 798."

whitesox,3cl2bn,SteveHarveysTailor,9,Wed Jul 8 19:11:29 2015 UTC,A couple of beers before an outing like that would probably take the edge off and allow you to be more relaxed on the mound.
whitesox,3cl2bn,New_Slurm,8,Wed Jul 8 19:28:29 2015 UTC,Lots of guys will take a shot before huge lifts in powerlifting. De La Hoya mentioned before that he'd take tequila before fights. It can just take that edge off.

whitesox,3cm5i2,Meatmehalfway,3,Thu Jul 9 03:05:32 2015 UTC,Should be an exciting series for sure.

whitesox,3cm5i2,dhcrazy333,2,Thu Jul 9 03:50:34 2015 UTC,Abreu at 3rd is probably a bad idea.  I'd rather have Avi or Melky DH.
whitesox,3cm5i2,Meatmehalfway,3,Thu Jul 9 03:57:22 2015 UTC,"At this point, I'm down with putting Shuck at 3rd if it means we get someone who can hit into the lineup."
whitesox,3cm5i2,dhcrazy333,2,Thu Jul 9 04:00:19 2015 UTC,Can't be much worse than Conor. And unfortunately Robin won't sit LaRoche. I agree though that would be a decent idea.

whitesox,3cm5i2,coopdogsnowman,2,Thu Jul 9 01:30:25 2015 UTC,Or a robot that never stops swinging while while at-bat. Probably would have a higher average than Sanchez. And you know what? Micah is pretty bad too. We have no good position players that are developed enough to replace Ramirez or Sanchez.

Like really bad. So in order for Micah to make up all the runs he would cost the Sox in atrocious defense and bad baserunning, he would have to hit like .330."

whitesox,3cko8n,waff1ez,2,Wed Jul 8 21:54:37 2015 UTC,I'd say we have a decent staff.. even more so when shark and danks aren't the worst.  If Rodon and Fulmer develop into their potential.. I could go out there and pitch as the 5th and they'd still be the best staff in baseball lol
whitesox,3cko8n,ACSimeon,9,Wed Jul 8 22:04:31 2015 UTC,"Basically, this ship has already sunk."
whitesox,3cko8n,k5therobot,5,Wed Jul 8 17:40:21 2015 UTC,Yeah. They basically need to deal or cut every position player that isn't Jose Abreu. Then they need to cryogenically freeze Jose until this team is good again.
whitesox,3cko8n,ACSimeon,7,Wed Jul 8 17:53:49 2015 UTC,I think Eaton could work his way back to average in a little time. He was useful last year. Everyone else is pretty much useless though.
whitesox,3cko8n,k5therobot,5,Wed Jul 8 17:57:27 2015 UTC,"I'm holding out a shred of hope that LaRoche, Melky, Avisail, and Alexei all step it up for the second half. As long as Ventura is manager that doesn't seem likely."
whitesox,3cko8n,ACSimeon,6,Wed Jul 8 18:03:41 2015 UTC,I am hoping the Cardinals get desperate and take LaRoche. He kind of makes sense for them. He is better in the NL so maybe we can salary dump him there and at least free ourselves of one bad contract.
whitesox,3cko8n,LastMileHome,4,Wed Jul 8 18:20:17 2015 UTC,That's the invisible hand in all of this. Why are they so terrible defensively? Are they being put in positions to succeed? All signs point to no. Why is that? Maybe the terrible manager? Almost 100% yes.
whitesox,3cko8n,k5therobot,5,Wed Jul 8 18:04:40 2015 UTC,"I wanted to believe in Robin at the beginning of this season. You know this. But after we lost 2 consecutive Chris Sale starts, during his MLB record streak, I lost all confidence in Robin."
whitesox,3cko8n,mushperv,2,Wed Jul 8 18:12:28 2015 UTC,"I think Avisail will be good, he's young and will develop more. Melky can still be good. LaRoche I'm not holding my breath on."
whitesox,3cko8n,ACSimeon,5,Thu Jul 9 04:23:54 2015 UTC,"I think he's another Podsednik. A great player when he's on, a shitty player when he isn't."
whitesox,3cko8n,Meatmehalfway,3,Wed Jul 8 18:05:20 2015 UTC,If he ends up as another Podsednik I would consider that a win considering our abysmal history with young position players.
whitesox,3cko8n,mushperv,4,Wed Jul 8 18:21:37 2015 UTC,"I hear what you're saying, but that isn't realistic. Melky had two more years and 25+ left on his deal. Eaton has money and years. Avi is good. No one wants Alexei, Flowers, Gillaspie, Beckham. Even if you release these guys, we still have to pay them.  We are stuck with this group. Only hope is that someone offers value for Shark, and Anderson and/or Davidson comes up and mashes."
whitesox,3cko8n,Meatmehalfway,2,Wed Jul 8 19:11:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this is a win or bust team that looks like a bust."

whitesox,3cko8n,ggslovin,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:53:11 2015 UTC,"I'm optimistic that Anderson will be a player, and that at least one or two of Thompson, Hawkins, and Davidson still be solid.  We are fine in pitching department, but we need a catcher and more OF help."
whitesox,3cko8n,thegreystash,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:57:37 2015 UTC,We need a superstar hitter.  Let's be honest.  Abreu is a 300 hitter and had a record year last year.  But he has regressed.  Avi at times plays like one but also goes into slumps.  After that there is a significant drop off.  I want a drafted and developed elite position player.  If this organization cannot develop one in ten freaking seasons then they don't belong in this league.
whitesox,3cko8n,Slooper1140,3,Wed Jul 8 23:07:15 2015 UTC,"""To put that into context, there's only one team that FanGraphs said had a worse crop of position players over the last 35 years -- the 1998 Twins, pegged at -4.5 WAR.  The White Sox are on pace for -8.8 WAR, which would be worse than every team since World War II except the 1979 Oakland Athletics, who posted a WAR of -9.7.""  Holy shit....."

whitesox,3cknw4,Drclaw411,9,Wed Jul 8 17:33:38 2015 UTC,If I were the Sox I would trade Carlos Sanchez for one of each of those new Hot Doug's sausages the Cubs are selling at Wrigley.
whitesox,3cknw4,ElTunaGrande,7,Wed Jul 8 20:53:15 2015 UTC,"I imagine you could get Danks for any single A lottery pick type prospect if you took on the rest of his contract. He is pretty much a washed up #5. I do not see the Cubs inquiring on him.  Shark should be dealt. I do not know if he will be though. He would be the cheaper option compared to Cueto. Castro would be a terrible pickup for the Sox but it would be very similar to Kenny picking up Rios who was another up and down player. The Sox would definitely take Baez for Shark but I do not see the Cubs giving him up for a rental. The only reason Shark got so much last year was because he had 1.5 years of control, was pitching great, and Beane still massively overpaid."
whitesox,3cknw4,k5therobot,3,Wed Jul 8 18:33:48 2015 UTC,I would go for some form of a Danks-Baez trade. There would have to be some other prospects/picks though.
whitesox,3cknw4,joel_of_the_jungle,5,Wed Jul 8 18:22:42 2015 UTC,"As much as I'd love that trade, the Cubs would get screwed & it's not even close. Shark for Baez would probably be a more reasonable trade. If Shark continues to pitch like he has of late then his value will increase. I know Baez struggled last season, but he could start right now for the Sox at either 3rd or 2nd. His power is still there as he's hitting well in AAA once again after returning from the leave he took after his sister past away. As for Danks, I doubt the Sox could trade him for anything at this point unless they eat money and acquire close to nothing in return."
whitesox,3cknw4,JBProds,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:58:11 2015 UTC,"I feel like Shark for Baez would work out great for both teams. With Castro, Russell, and Bryant we have a logjam in the infield. We could put Bryant in center or left and Baez at first, but Bryant is a near gold glove third baseman and just an average outfielder.  Baez might turn into a great power hitter, but the Cubs need a good starting pitcher now. Baez might end up better than Shark as a player in the long run, but the way I see it when you have a chance to make a push for the playoffs like the Cubs do, why waste it?  As for the Sox, they absolutely need young talent. If Baez ends up as advertised, he and Abreu could anchor that lineup for a long time. I could see the Cubs refusing a deal unless Shark agreed to re-sign, and I guess I understand that. But the way I see it, Baez for Shark addresses both teams' most pressing needs."
whitesox,3cknw4,JBProds,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:03:07 2015 UTC,I still think the Cubs would get the worse end of the deal. Shark isn't a lock like you mentioned & I'm not sure if Theo & Co. don't think they could acquire something more. I'd love Baez. I'm not reading too much into that short stint last season.
whitesox,3cknw4,weasol12,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:08:38 2015 UTC,"Baez might end up being a good power hitter, but 95 strikeouts in 213 trips to the plate, no thank you. The Sox need infielders who know how to use a glove and not kick it around or throw it into the dugout. As nice as it would be to get rid of Danks (and bring up Erik Johnson, but that's a discussion for a different post) I don't think there's a fair deal that actually helps either team."
whitesox,3cknw4,EvilFefe,3,Thu Jul 9 13:55:03 2015 UTC,I follow both teams and we don't need another starter! We're good there dude. We have something like the 5th best era in baseball.   I don't think anyone one we have would make a Huge difference to the Sox either  If it was possible I'd want Quintana. Kid is a stud. However if the sox are smart they can see that and won't give him up that easy.
whitesox,3cknw4,EvilFefe,2,Wed Jul 8 20:20:43 2015 UTC,"A lot of that is due to the bullpen being awesome lately. Wada is hurt, Wood is in the pen, and who knows how Richard will fare long term."

Both are available, we wouldn't want Castro unless we moved Alexei as well (and this would be a downgrade) and Baez isn't even mildly interesting nor worth shipping even Danks to the north side."

whitesox,3cknw4,JBProds,5,Wed Jul 8 18:37:00 2015 UTC,"What about Russell for Samardzija and idk what else? Really though, I think Baez is the better player. I just know Jed and Theo see Russell as the second coming and wouldn't do a one-for-one with him.  Maybe I'm giving up on him too early (I do have a tendency to call ""bust"" way too early), but the guy just doesn't seem like he can hit (hence why I suggested one of the other two)."
whitesox,3cknw4,weasol12,6,Wed Jul 8 17:40:58 2015 UTC,What's wrong with Baez? You can't judge a player based off the 52 games he played last season. Mike Trout hit .220 his first showing in the Bigs (40 games). Baez still showed tremendous power. He always hit for a good average in the minors. He'd be an upgrade at 2nd and 3rd. He's only 22. How can you not want to trade Danks for one of the best prospects a season ago? Danks should be traded for anything more than a single-A back up at this point.
whitesox,3cknw4,Unknownentity7,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:05:01 2015 UTC,"If I'm the Sox I'm not touching Baez with a 10 foot pole. Strikes out wayyyy to much for any player, let alone a second baseman"

I think it's time to just find new scouts. Notice that we currently only have 4 players on the MLB roster that the White Sox actually drafted themselves? Sale, Rodon, Petricka & Beckham. The sad part is that none of them are a starting position player."

whitesox,3ci60j,TonyBagadoughnuts,3,Wed Jul 8 14:21:32 2015 UTC,Because he was supposed to be the next second baseman. So far he's looking exactly like Gordon Beckham.
whitesox,3ci60j,JBProds,2,Wed Jul 8 11:34:44 2015 UTC,Beckham never hit this bad as an everyday second baseman. Sanchez's .166 batting average is making Beckham's career .243 batting average look like Ty Cobb.
whitesox,3ci60j,JBProds,2,Wed Jul 8 19:46:15 2015 UTC,Do you remember what it was like when he first came up? It was ugly. Just as ugly as this.
whitesox,3ci60j,JBProds,3,Wed Jul 8 20:13:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but that was literally his first 14 games of his career. After his 15th career game, he already had a higher batting average than Sanchez and never was close to the Mendoza Line after that. Sanchez has already played 75 MLB games including 28 last season."

whitesox,3ci60j,JBProds,8,Wed Jul 8 02:46:55 2015 UTC,"I gotta disagree with you there. Micah's defense was horrendous, he only had 3 errors with the Sox because he was so bad at getting to balls in the first place."
whitesox,3ci60j,TonyBagadoughnuts,0,Wed Jul 8 14:24:06 2015 UTC,"No one is saying was good on defense or even average.

whitesox,3ci60j,TonyBagadoughnuts,-1,Wed Jul 8 20:00:49 2015 UTC,"Micah wouldn't be a 9-hitter. If he stayed up, he'd probably be in the two hole. How much of has Sanchez helped the Sox defensively? Sure he's a lot better than Micah, but the White Sox are still dead last defensively. -41.4 is pathetic. If the White Sox are going to suck defensively regardless of who is at second, you might as well try to score some runs to give them a chance to win some games."
whitesox,3ci60j,JBProds,5,Wed Jul 8 20:49:23 2015 UTC,"Counterpoint: No. He probably wouldn't be in the 2-hole. Robin has never put him in the 2-hole. Robin overwhelmingly bats his 2Bs 9th.   Also, Micah Johnson's high-leverage batting avg is .000  You can justifiably hate Carlos Sanchez's bat all you want, but don't romanticize whatever flashes of brilliance you think you saw in Micah Johnson. That dude is not ready for the majors."
whitesox,3ci60j,RushLimbaughIsFat,-1,Wed Jul 8 21:13:47 2015 UTC,"What are you talking about? You think Robin would put someone who had never played an MLB game 2nd right off the bat? Are you that ignorant? He literally only played in 27 games in his MLB career and had a .270 batting average. He had one of the best batting averages on the team. With his speed, it's likely he'd beat out enough infield singles to either maintain that average or improve it. If he kept getting on base, I can't see why Robin wouldn't put him there. He put Alexei there for Christ's sake.  Why do you keep making assumptions? Who saw flashes of brilliance? If the Sox had someone that could at least hit .200 then having Micah in AAA would make sense, but they don't. I know Micah isn't exactly ready, but I can't help but laugh if you think Sanchez is. Keep contradicting yourself."
whitesox,3ci60j,JBProds,3,Wed Jul 8 21:38:41 2015 UTC,"Micah Johnson has nearly the same WAR (-0.7) as Sanchez (-1.0), despite the fact that Micah has played nearly half the games. That is because Johnson's defense is so fucking terrible. Not counting the fact that WAR doesn't factor in Micah's other mistakes like not being there for the relay throw or covering 2nd base, or his bad baserunning."
whitesox,3ci60j,RushLimbaughIsFat,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:20:57 2015 UTC,"Isn't that sad though? Sanchez is so good defensively yet his WAR is (01.0)? I wish he could at least reach the Mendoza Line. Hopefully this 2 hit performance can spark something, but I'm not getting my hopes up."
whitesox,3ci60j,TonyBagadoughnuts,2,Thu Jul 9 05:10:36 2015 UTC,"What's even sadder is the Sox has proven themselves dreadfully incompetent at developing hitters. Carlos Sanchez, Gordon Beckham, and most frustratingly, Adam Eaton, not so much with contact it self, but even with his heroics today, he needs to STOP SWINGING FOR THE FENCES. He keeps getting popups and shallow flyballs. He's a leadoff hitter, not the cleanup hitter. Also he does that stupid quirk where he drags his foot across first base. He needs to stop doing that before he breaks his ankle.  Sorry for the rambling. I got mad because I thought about how everything about the Sox excluding their pitching rotation (except Danks, he's pretty bad) and Abreu is bad."
whitesox,3ci60j,JBProds,2,Thu Jul 9 06:55:59 2015 UTC,"I feel like an idiot for even replying to this. Micah Johnson has literally never batted 2nd in his mlb career, you say ""If he stayed up, he'd probably by in the two hole"", and we are supposed to accept that as a fact?  Dude, I want Micah Johnson to be good just as much as you do, but HE CANNOT FIELD."
whitesox,3ci60j,RushLimbaughIsFat,0,Wed Jul 8 23:07:41 2015 UTC,"Why would it be a ""fact"" when it's clearly an assumption. Saying that he wouldn't bat second because he has never hit there yet in ONLY 27 games is crazy. Abreu didn't hit second all of last season & the majority of last season. Based off your reasoning, he would never hit 2nd in his career, but that's where he's been hitting. Ventura wants someone in the two hole that can get on base and that's what Micah was doing early in the season.  Also, it was know that Micah couldn't field. Why was he the starting second baseman from Opening Day if he was the same player we saw in Spring Training?"
whitesox,3ci60j,DeumTeam,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:14:37 2015 UTC,You're also missing the fact that Micah sucks ass at baserunning. What the hell is the point of getting on base if you're going to make foolish decisions? The dude sometimes looks like he doesn't know how to play baseball.
whitesox,3ci60j,JBProds,0,Thu Jul 9 04:09:54 2015 UTC,"No use trying to be reasonable with this kid. He's obviously thick headed. You keep bringing up good points.  My take is that they're both lacking something the other can do better. I'd give Johnson the edge because he wasn't as bad hitting as Sanchez is hitting. Plus, his speed would help this team. My biggest question is why they gave up on Johnson after 27 games meanwhile Sanchez will play his 48th game of the season tonight. They sent Johnson down to improve his defense, why not do the same with Sanchez & his bat? It's reached the point where we're not even sure if Sanchez believes he can get a hit. His confidence has probably never been lower."
whitesox,3ci60j,faramir20,0,Wed Jul 8 21:52:43 2015 UTC,I wouldn't call him thick skulled. We just have two different point of views although I do think it's immature to assume that I romanticize over flashes of brilliance.

Unless he pitches like this until he's 42 (which don't get me wrong, he could), I see him joining Konerko in the hall of very very good.  (Both of them would have my vote for the HoF, but I just don't see them getting voted in).  Thing is, Buehrle was always good.  Hell he was even great at times.  But he was never a dominant force like many of the HoF pitchers you see.  He's never had an ERA under 3, never won 20 games, didn't rack up strikeouts.    Now all that said, his longevity, consecutive seasons of 200+ innings and double digit wins and the fact that he pitched so effectively with the stuff he had definitely helps his bid, but I think if we compare him to other pitchers who haven't made it, I just don't see it.  He'd have my vote but that's because I watched him my entire career and have a bias.  I just don't think that the people actually voting will give him the benefit of the doubt.  They will look at him and see a consistently good pitcher who was never outright dominant."

whitesox,3cgfge,RogerKickass,2,Tue Jul 7 20:12:46 2015 UTC,I actually saw his perfect game live.
whitesox,3cgfge,doyouevenIift,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:41:47 2015 UTC,So did I. And I only went to the game impulsively at the last minute!
whitesox,3cgfge,baraksobamas,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:45:07 2015 UTC,My friend and his wife went to that game for their first date.
whitesox,3ciize,doyouevenIift,3,Wed Jul 8 04:27:18 2015 UTC,You mean the 2005 caricature shirts?
whitesox,3ciize,ACSimeon,2,Wed Jul 8 11:35:01 2015 UTC,Oh I thought they were specifically Buehrle. Thanks though
whitesox,3ciize,chocoholicsoxfan,2,Wed Jul 8 22:12:58 2015 UTC,Buerhle is right next to Ozzie on the shirt though. Hopefully because they're both going to have their numbers retired.

whitesox,3chied,bababooey55,2,Wed Jul 8 01:50:28 2015 UTC,May I recommend intentionally walking him every time he comes to the plate?
whitesox,3chied,pg2441,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:16:13 2015 UTC,I would just start throwing it at him.
whitesox,3chied,OandAlifer,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:26:07 2015 UTC,I wouldn't mess with Donaldson or the rest of Blue Jays offense for that matter.

whitesox,3chied,GracefulShutdown,4,Tue Jul 7 23:49:19 2015 UTC,Why do always start getting hits with 2 outs? That's why we have games with 1 run and 10+ hits.

whitesox,3chied,ricker182,6,Wed Jul 8 02:39:22 2015 UTC,Josh Donaldson is so good. I wonder what it would have taken for us to get him last off-season.

whitesox,3chied,MustacheMark,2,Wed Jul 8 00:31:37 2015 UTC,Looking good.

whitesox,3cd1o0,E-raticMenace,19,Mon Jul 6 23:31:27 2015 UTC,Best pitcher in MLB. I'm proud of this kid. No one in MLB deserves to be on the all star team more. It will be an honor to watch him start.
whitesox,3cd1o0,Petey_Peppers,-5,Tue Jul 7 00:47:09 2015 UTC,Max Scherzer tho
whitesox,3cd1o0,doyouevenIift,8,Tue Jul 7 02:46:38 2015 UTC,"Scherzer has much more run support, and Sale missed 2 starts and he's the starting pitcher in AL competing against Keuchel, Gray, and Archer. I would say Sale's performace is more impressive, because he still manages to be a dominant pitcher in a ballclub that you can tell doesn't have much chemistry and even has a negative atmosphere.   I will give props to Scherzer though. Dude's dominant too."
whitesox,3cd1o0,RushLimbaughIsFat,4,Tue Jul 7 04:23:09 2015 UTC,Hope he gets that well deserved starting nod!   And I know he hasn't been as dominate as he was earlier in the year but Robertson should've made it over Kelvin bleeping Herrea. I mean there has to be a better option...
whitesox,3cd1o0,callmeroo,2,Mon Jul 6 23:57:04 2015 UTC,I don't think anyone is surprised Yost selected both Davis & Herrera although Davis has been incredible.
whitesox,3cd1o0,JBProds,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:03:21 2015 UTC,"Good point on Yost, some are saying Sale won't get the nod b/c of him but we'll see...and yea Davis is legit, idk how he did it but his career did a complete 180"
whitesox,3cd1o0,callmeroo,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:05:44 2015 UTC,"Davis showed flashes of dominance out of the bullpen in 2012 & then Royals put him back in the rotation in 2013. I think once Yost saw Davis throw that 99 mph heat that sat around 92-93 while starting, he knew where Davis should be."

whitesox,3cd1o0,jnez50,2,Mon Jul 6 23:53:50 2015 UTC,I think Ned Yost will use his personal feelings to make the decision. Chris did try to go into the Royals club house after their fight.
whitesox,3cd1o0,JBProds,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:55:13 2015 UTC,"I love Sale, but I will set aside my personal biases. I have a hard time seeing Sale start over Keuchel & Chris Archer. At the end of the day, all three are deserving. With that being said, I wouldn't want any other pitcher right now than Sale.  On a side note, Keuchel has had the privilege to face this White Sox offense twice & Archer has faced them once. Sale would shut out this offense on a nightly basis."
whitesox,3cdn3q,dhcrazy333,17,Tue Jul 7 02:27:20 2015 UTC,"Also I just want to point out, there were 2 play reviews, 6 runs, and the game still was over in under 2 hours. Now that's a baseball game."

whitesox,3cdn3q,JBProds,2,Tue Jul 7 03:49:10 2015 UTC,"I'm jealous. I hope your six year old enjoyed watching two great lefties perform up to expectations. Too bad Sale couldn't have made history, but you guys still got to witness two complete games."
whitesox,3cdn3q,mushperv,3,Tue Jul 7 05:08:22 2015 UTC,"At this point he is more interested in the food, but he is coming around. He watched good potions of the game and asked questions.   Last time we took him he just people watched."
whitesox,3cdn3q,ACSimeon,10,Tue Jul 7 14:22:17 2015 UTC,The meet-up was fine. I saw a couple of you guys there. Here's to many more.
whitesox,3cdn3q,ACSimeon,5,Tue Jul 7 03:13:29 2015 UTC,Maybe next time I won't have family members with me or be in the 500 section.
whitesox,3cdn3q,OpSecAccount,3,Tue Jul 7 03:17:13 2015 UTC,"I had my brother & his girlfriend with me. We bought our tickets for the 500 section, but sat in the bleachers until after the meet up. Then we sat behind homeplate. Funny thing, my aunt's ex-husband was there. It was definitely more awkward than the reddit meetup lol."
whitesox,3cdn3q,OpSecAccount,2,Tue Jul 7 03:33:48 2015 UTC,I left my spot in the 500s after the 1st inning and made my way down to various sections. by myself. LET'S GO WHITE SOX!!!
whitesox,3cdn3q,AnDEErew,2,Tue Jul 7 04:56:40 2015 UTC,"ya tu sabes. mi amigo.  We'll get a meet up officially going soon, yeah?"
whitesox,3cdn3q,LJ_K,8,Tue Jul 7 04:53:42 2015 UTC,"Offense keeps doing enough. That was clutch coming through to punish the error by Reyes. Sale showed that he can be more than just a strikeout machine, letting the defense do some, albeit shaky, work. I'm optimistic, let's keep this going!"
whitesox,3cdn3q,OpSecAccount,2,Tue Jul 7 02:35:48 2015 UTC,We just need petey to show up next time
whitesox,3cdn3q,chocoholicsoxfan,2,Tue Jul 7 03:47:02 2015 UTC,I'm with you there. LJ at the shitty meet up!!!!
whitesox,3cdn3q,ethanlan,11,Tue Jul 7 04:51:56 2015 UTC,"Four thoughts...  three of which are tangentially related to this team.  1) Look at every single post game interview and you will find the pitcher singing Tyler's praises and half-crediting him with the win. Hmmmm.  2) Jose Quintana has 7 consecutive quality starts.  3) We're the hottest team in the ALC! (If you look at our last ten).  4) (Unrelated to this team). I'm really fucking sick and tired of people bringing up 1919 to show we're talentless cheaters. Got in an argument today with a Twins fan who said that. Please excuse oncoming caps: HELLO. WE ARE THE ONLY TEAM IN THE ALC WITH NO SUSPENSIONS FOR PEDS, EVER, DURING A PLAYER'S TENURE WITH THE SOX. YOUR ACE LITERALLY JUST FINISHED SERVING HIS SUSPENSION THIS WEEK. YOU TELL ME WHO'S A CHEATER. CAN WE PLEASE FUCKING GET OVER 1919 AND STOP USING IT IN ARGUMENTS TODAY? PEOPLE ALWAYS USE THIS AS THEIR ULTIMATE TRUMP CARD, AND I'M USUALLY TOO FLABBERGASTED TO RESPOND, SO THEY THINK THEY'RE SMARTER. THE SOX MAY BE TERRIBLE, BUT THEY HAVE THE MOST INTEGRITY OF ANY TEAM IN THE ALC.  Edit: Also, didn't do the meet up thing since I was with my family and I don't much believe in meeting strangers off the Internet, anyway. But I'm glad it was successful!"

whitesox,3cczvv,chisoxbot,23,Mon Jul 6 23:16:44 2015 UTC,You know Chris is the type of guy that is way happier with a win than the record.
whitesox,3cczvv,RustyShackleford___,15,Tue Jul 7 02:06:11 2015 UTC,The man reminds me of Captain Toews.
whitesox,3cczvv,NineduceXII,22,Tue Jul 7 02:07:38 2015 UTC,1 hour 55 minutes.

whitesox,3cczvv,thom_weights,4,Tue Jul 7 02:08:01 2015 UTC,Class comment! Take my upvote and go with Christ Sale
whitesox,3cczvv,RushLimbaughIsFat,20,Tue Jul 7 02:09:19 2015 UTC,Stone is right. Sale is probably not going to break the consecutive strikeout record because the Blue Jays' lineup is swinging at everything in the strikezone.
whitesox,3cczvv,ElTunaGrande,7,Tue Jul 7 00:27:12 2015 UTC,I'm at the game. Their making contact with anything close. Will take a miracle for this to happen tonight.

whitesox,3cczvv,GracefulShutdown,5,Tue Jul 7 00:56:02 2015 UTC,It generally is a very chill sub and we welcome fans from opponents all the time. I think we're much better than the other AL East subreddits in my totally unbiased opinion.

whitesox,3cczvv,RogerKickass,7,Tue Jul 7 02:06:08 2015 UTC,This game lasted less than 2 hours. You just gotta love pitchers who won't stick a whole hour of their bullshit into the game. I just wish this becomes the norm some day.
whitesox,3cczvv,froglegs_jackson,8,Tue Jul 7 02:13:00 2015 UTC,Buehrle and Sale are both amped-up right now. They're both up 2-3 mph on their fastball.

whitesox,3cczvv,TheHoneyBadger23,3,Tue Jul 7 01:04:03 2015 UTC,It's pretty much the same thing.  Sometimes we get a little more emphatic and it's more like churning butter

whitesox,3cczvv,ricker182,4,Tue Jul 7 00:55:20 2015 UTC,Because they should be able to bunt.
whitesox,3cczvv,Spaaace_Ghooost,2,Tue Jul 7 00:59:14 2015 UTC,Robin is trying to keep the game short. He knows Sanchez is going to get out so why not speed it up.
whitesox,3cczvv,NineduceXII,6,Tue Jul 7 01:14:29 2015 UTC,1 hour 54 minute game. Wow!

whitesox,3cczvv,ZeldaFreak1000,3,Tue Jul 7 00:16:06 2015 UTC,Good hustle. Anyone know if us 500ers can get into the 100s at this point?
whitesox,3cczvv,froglegs_jackson,3,Tue Jul 7 00:18:01 2015 UTC,I'm not sure if you can but when I went to the game on Friday there was no one checking seats in the 100 section so I guess it's possible. Just make sure that the seats don't belong to anyone.
whitesox,3cczvv,ricker182,2,Tue Jul 7 00:43:40 2015 UTC,Just made it down here!. 3 K down only more to come

whitesox,3cczvv,MustacheMark,8,Tue Jul 7 00:44:03 2015 UTC,For once I feel like the Sox actually won a game and the other didn't lose it.
whitesox,3cczvv,Xeno_man,5,Tue Jul 7 02:06:01 2015 UTC,Even though all 4 runs we scored were unearned?

whitesox,3cczvv,deeter72,6,Tue Jul 7 02:08:47 2015 UTC,Yeah if Chris Sale could strikeout all the Jays it would make me so happy.
whitesox,3cczvv,Petey_Peppers,5,Mon Jul 6 23:49:06 2015 UTC,Bunting in the third inning? SWING THE DAMN BAT
whitesox,3cczvv,deeter72,5,Tue Jul 7 00:44:19 2015 UTC,"Might be an indication that with the current pitchers, there isn't going to be any big innings."
whitesox,3cczvv,Petey_Peppers,6,Tue Jul 7 00:48:26 2015 UTC,We did it! It's amazing how you can feel the winds of change. This is the hottest team in baseball right now with no signs of slowing down anytime soon.
whitesox,3cczvv,chocoholicsoxfan,2,Tue Jul 7 02:10:37 2015 UTC,I think the Brewers might want to have a word with you

whitesox,3cczvv,TLKv3,6,Tue Jul 7 02:26:46 2015 UTC,Is this a White Sox sub or what? Seriously. This team with this pitching staff and you wanna play semantics and talk about the Brewers? Pathetic! People talking about bittersweet beating Buehrle. Pathetic! This team is red hot right now and we should all be celebrating it. Not acting like dip shits.
whitesox,3cczvv,iOwnAnlPhone,3,Tue Jul 7 02:29:21 2015 UTC,He's like that crazy drunk uncle at family functions that you kind of hate and like at the same time. He's our lovable troll!

This kind of mindless goober fandom  reminds Cubs fans of years past. The team isn't going to get better until the ownership sees the fans turning on the team.   I also hated my drunk uncle too..."
whitesox,3cczvv,zgwarnki,3,Tue Jul 7 21:17:46 2015 UTC,Good way to start it off!

whitesox,3cczvv,Aperture-Employee,3,Tue Jul 7 01:47:06 2015 UTC,Flowers is going to hit a homerun to tie it.  Then we will go 12 innings to get the 10 strikeouts before Sanchez hits his own homerun to win it.

whitesox,3cc3jy,GrilledCheez00,19,Mon Jul 6 19:23:41 2015 UTC,"Here is how rain delays and postponements will work tonight.    5:00 - 7:05 =  Rain clears up, looking like clear skies.  7:05 - 7:11 = A light drizzle, barely a drizzle begins.  Game starts  7:11 - 7:16 = Sale gets in 4 to 7 pitches, the heavens open up and it begins to pour.  7:16 = Rain delay announced  7:35 = Looks like we lucked out, it was only really bad for about 20 minutes, tarp begins to get removed.  7:36 = Rain increases, tarp goes back onto the field.  7:59 = It looks like it might be clearing up again, but they decide to wait before doing the tarp again.  8:04 = It is decided that their just going to go for it, the tarp is removed  8:07 = Up to 10 more pitches are allowed to happen before lightning strikes one of the pinwheels.  Game is delayed  8:36 = Game is back on, but now a lost senior citizen Cubs fan has wandered into the outfield.  It takes 15 minutes to wrangle them up.  8:51 = Game is back on, three more pitches are thrown before someone dumps a bucket of water on the homeplate ump.  The umpire thinks its rain, and calls the game.    9:00 = Ventura comes out to argue, goes into a rage, quits his job, and the skies clear up.  9:01 - 11:35 = Coop fills in as manager, Sale strikes out 27, White Sox win 32-0"

whitesox,3cb303,chocoholicsoxfan,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:21:36 2015 UTC,So we're the worst team in the AL... we have some good trade pieces and could get some prospects... and we're just gonna sit on our thumbs like a bunch of idiots. Neat.
whitesox,3cb303,PatrickBateman1,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:24:35 2015 UTC,Who exactly (besides Sale) do you think we could get something for? Everyone on our team is having the worst year of their lives. Garcia is the only possible trade piece.
whitesox,3cb303,chocoholicsoxfan,5,Mon Jul 6 18:29:33 2015 UTC,"No way we trade away any of our young talent. People even suggesting Sale are crazy. He's arguably the most underpaid player in the league, he's young, and he's amazing. I don't like the idea of trading young established players for other young players who are not even proven.  Smardzija is the big one here. It's the last year of his contract and contenders want another solid arm in the rotation. He's been pitching well lately too.  Other teams will see certain things in players that may be having a rough year too. Not saying we'll get much for a Melky or LaRoche, but there might be offers. Maybe even Alexei.  Zach Duke might be able to fetch something decent too.  Not saying we have a crop of trade-able players, but the team really needs to be getting out there and seeing what they can get."
whitesox,3cb303,PatrickBateman1,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:40:32 2015 UTC,I'm kind of confused because this post almost directly opposes your first one...
whitesox,3cb303,k5therobot,2,Mon Jul 6 18:46:14 2015 UTC,"Trade away older players/vets to teams that are contending, not players that we plan on having stick around for a while and building with."
whitesox,3cb303,arsesox,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:54:14 2015 UTC,I agree with you. People saying Shark won't get anything are way off. He has a strong track record. He has pitched at least 7 inninngs in 9 of his last 10 starts. That alone is useful for teams trying to not stretch their bullpen too thin. He has been linked to numerous teams. 4.33 is not a great ERA but he is trending the right way and has the history to back it up. I do not think he will get a huge haul but he should fetch something useful.  The only way the Sox should not trade him is if they plan on giving him an extension.
whitesox,3cb303,chocoholicsoxfan,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:39:13 2015 UTC,"Sale, Abreu, and Robertson are the only players we have that's worth a damn."
whitesox,3cb303,chocoholicsoxfan,-1,Mon Jul 6 18:38:54 2015 UTC,"Jeff Samardzija should have stayed on the Cubs if he wants the best chance of winning in October for several years. It pains me to say it, but it's true :("
whitesox,3cb303,ACSimeon,5,Mon Jul 6 15:36:44 2015 UTC,"Winning a game? Sure. But a World Series? Eh, I doubt it."
whitesox,3cb303,chocoholicsoxfan,2,Mon Jul 6 15:45:29 2015 UTC,"""I just want to sign with a team that is competing every September with a chance to be playing in October.""  Haha wow that sounds kind of douchey now in retrospect. I mean, he's a decent player for sure, but so inconsistent. He obviously thinks he ""deserves"" to contend though, even though the likes of Chris Sale and Felix Hernandez have never seen playoffs, and they're 10x more talented. I guess we'll have to see how he does in the playoffs to be sure."
whitesox,3cb303,Meatmehalfway,3,Mon Jul 6 15:53:52 2015 UTC,"The crazy thing is Samardzija's been really good the last couple of starts. If Jeff puts together another solid start, then I might take the frowny face off of his K-Card."
whitesox,3cb303,ACSimeon,3,Mon Jul 6 16:23:20 2015 UTC,Yep! And that start against the Tigers looks a lot worse on paper and can be blamed on Robin not warming someone up in the bullpen. MAN was he pissed after giving up that home run.
whitesox,3cb303,chocoholicsoxfan,2,Mon Jul 6 16:28:02 2015 UTC,A couple more solid starts and we might get something big in return.
whitesox,3cb303,chocoholicsoxfan,3,Mon Jul 6 17:01:15 2015 UTC,At this point we might as well ride out the rest of the year with him and see what happens. No one is going to give us a good enough trade value for him. We just can't re-sign him unless he helps carry this team to a playoff berth in the second half.

whitesox,3cb303,oG_Goober,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:28:07 2015 UTC,He won't want to stay though. The article says he only wants to go to teams that have a shot at competing. Doesn't like he wants to stick around and see how a new coaching staff will turn out. He's starting to hit his prime.
whitesox,3cb303,chocoholicsoxfan,2,Mon Jul 6 21:02:43 2015 UTC,I'd argue that we've already seen his prime and this will be standard Shark going forward regardless of where he is.

whitesox,3cb303,The1andonlyZack,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:23:19 2015 UTC,"He didn't have a choice. The Cubs traded him to the A's for Addison Russell, it was completely out of his control."
whitesox,3cb303,chocoholicsoxfan,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:22:50 2015 UTC,"That is true, but did you ever get the sense that he wasn't happy on the Cubs? I mean, just in interviews, the way he walked off the mound, his expression in the dugout, etc. He always just seemed really disgruntled with his situation to me. Maybe it was my Cubs-disliking mind imagining it, idk. But then he seemed so pumped to come here in comparison."

I became a Sox fan under the 80s red, white, and blue, and there is no way I'd ever want them to leave the style that made the team go mainstream around the world.  As far as the team name on the hat... The partial nickname (the team nickname is White Sox after all) had been on the hat for generations. Who cares that no one else does it?  Do you want to go back to the cursive ""C"" that was a knock-off of the brave's hat? Why not do something different than the blue and red Cubs?"

If you look up his fWAR and compare it to how players did on the teams be coached in several years of his prime would have been (one of for some combinations) our best players. Robin had an 0-40 or something slump in his career too tho, so maybe he just always thinks things will be better (because he has more baseball talent in his left nut than some guys on our team with negative WARs).

whitesox,3c4ate,thekyle1591,9,Sat Jul 4 21:01:33 2015 UTC,Play of the year candidate right there. Incredible.
whitesox,3c4ate,froglegs_jackson,7,Sat Jul 4 21:01:02 2015 UTC,There are probably 10-12 teams scouting Samardzija today. He picked a pretty good time to pitch a gem.
whitesox,3c4ate,froglegs_jackson,8,Sat Jul 4 20:01:13 2015 UTC,Holy shit. AVI!
whitesox,3c4ate,RushLimbaughIsFat,7,Sat Jul 4 21:00:34 2015 UTC,Avi you beautiful massive human being.
whitesox,3c4ate,reekorse,13,Sat Jul 4 21:00:46 2015 UTC,"FUCK the security guard at gate 5. Seriously, if you see this, fuck you. Dude wouldn't let me get a bobble head.they were opening a new box when I went through, didn't get one and before I even made it up the stairs saw they opened a new box. You're a piece of shit gate 5 security guard prick"
whitesox,3c4ate,Ramp_Rat,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:34:25 2015 UTC,Can you explain what happened?
whitesox,3c4ate,Vikingfanant,3,Sat Jul 4 21:06:01 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing the giveaway. They were probably opening a box of them when OP was walking through, so he couldn't get one, but had to keep walking. After they got the box open he probably tried to go back but the guard said no."
whitesox,3c4ate,raj96,2,Sat Jul 4 21:12:37 2015 UTC,"Yep, thats how it went down. Myself and my girlfriend didn't get one, and when we went to grab one from the new box the security guard told us ""you already got one."" As we're standing there, having not left the room, clearly without one...   Never thought a Bobby jenks bobble head would cause so much frustration"
whitesox,3c4ate,Ramp_Rat,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:56:20 2015 UTC,"very lame. Although by the look of the crowd shots, wouldn't be surprised if there were some leftover lol"

whitesox,3c4ate,drinkbeerneverfear,6,Sat Jul 4 21:00:20 2015 UTC,"Holy smokes, AVI!"

whitesox,3c4ate,Ramp_Rat,6,Sat Jul 4 20:05:07 2015 UTC,Fuck you Putnam. And that fucking security guard. You both suck
whitesox,3c4ate,froglegs_jackson,5,Sat Jul 4 20:43:46 2015 UTC,That dude has been there forever. Every time a reliever comes in they give him a fist bump. Not a bad gig.
whitesox,3c4ate,froglegs_jackson,5,Sat Jul 4 20:44:37 2015 UTC,"At least Robertson will be well rested for the 9th, eh Robin."
whitesox,3c4ate,RushLimbaughIsFat,6,Sat Jul 4 20:43:56 2015 UTC,I felt terrible when Samardzija shook his head and headed to the clubhouse. Fuck this bullpen and fuck these hitters.
whitesox,3c4ate,drinkbeerneverfear,5,Sat Jul 4 20:44:22 2015 UTC,Yeah fucking hate that. Very solid day from him
whitesox,3c4ate,TheCity95,5,Sat Jul 4 20:45:48 2015 UTC,WHAT A CATCH!!!!

whitesox,3c4ate,Georgie56,6,Sat Jul 4 21:03:27 2015 UTC,That's A White Sox Winner
whitesox,3c4ate,Meatmehalfway,4,Sat Jul 4 21:06:41 2015 UTC,I'm telling you something is different about this team.  I know we've let guys on today but the bats are heating up at the same time as the pitching.
whitesox,3c4ate,Georgie56,2,Sat Jul 4 19:55:48 2015 UTC,"A little bit too late, unfortunately."
whitesox,3c4ate,RushLimbaughIsFat,2,Sat Jul 4 19:57:15 2015 UTC,"Not too late. It's before the all-star break, although I think the break may break this team's momentum."
whitesox,3c4ate,drinkbeerneverfear,4,Sat Jul 4 20:57:36 2015 UTC,Stir it up please   Edit: Woo got the lead!
whitesox,3c4ate,ADS94,4,Sat Jul 4 20:44:22 2015 UTC,What a freaking ballgame!
whitesox,3c4ate,Koneesha,4,Sat Jul 4 21:03:36 2015 UTC,"The fourth straight win comes on the fourth. Coincidence, I think not."
whitesox,3c4ate,99levtt,3,Sat Jul 4 21:44:14 2015 UTC,Pretty sure there was a flyby.  Just heard some loud jets roar past my house (in Beverly).
whitesox,3c4ate,MustacheMark,3,Sat Jul 4 18:09:18 2015 UTC,Sanchez does have some good D.
whitesox,3c4ate,Georgie56,3,Sat Jul 4 19:12:37 2015 UTC,"Crap. Man. Well, I'll take another win."
whitesox,3c4ate,raj96,3,Sat Jul 4 19:54:48 2015 UTC,"Shit, he was sooooooo close"
whitesox,3c4ate,froglegs_jackson,3,Sat Jul 4 19:55:52 2015 UTC,"9K's 1BB 0R. That'll work, Shark."
whitesox,3c4ate,froglegs_jackson,3,Sat Jul 4 20:20:37 2015 UTC,"Don't think Robin will do it, but I would go to Robertson for 4 outs here."
whitesox,3c4ate,chocoholicsoxfan,3,Sat Jul 4 20:37:18 2015 UTC,At least Robin seems to have learned from what happened in Detroit last week.
whitesox,3c4ate,drinkbeerneverfear,3,Sat Jul 4 20:37:54 2015 UTC,Damn it
whitesox,3c4ate,drinkbeerneverfear,3,Sat Jul 4 20:40:41 2015 UTC,well shit

whitesox,3c4ate,froglegs_jackson,2,Sat Jul 4 19:37:54 2015 UTC,Good to see Jenks back at the cell. He looks good.
whitesox,3c4ate,RushLimbaughIsFat,2,Sat Jul 4 18:44:51 2015 UTC,Bobby Jenks was sooo good in his prime. It's too bad injuries derailed his career.
whitesox,3c4ate,The-Assman,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:49:24 2015 UTC,Yeah. He used to be really good. Unfortunately I witnessed his decline myself.
whitesox,3c4ate,Roederoid,2,Sat Jul 4 18:59:37 2015 UTC,I like how they made sure to have the Jenks bobble head be really fat.
whitesox,3c4ate,doyouevenIift,2,Sat Jul 4 20:58:38 2015 UTC,"Leadoff double, walk; men on 2nd and 3rd with one out... and we can't score either of them. We should have had at least 2 runs out of that."
whitesox,3c4ate,Roederoid,2,Sat Jul 4 19:09:53 2015 UTC,"I'm a little late, is Samardzija perfect? The box score on my phone won't load.  Edit: Hawk just said 14 in a row. Not perfect, but still an amazing performance!"
whitesox,3c4ate,doyouevenIift,2,Sat Jul 4 19:28:13 2015 UTC,"He only walked the first hitter, got out later in a double play."
whitesox,3c4ate,doyouevenIift,2,Sat Jul 4 19:31:46 2015 UTC,Jose is love. Jose is life.
whitesox,3c4ate,october23sp,2,Sat Jul 4 19:41:22 2015 UTC,"Alright we couldn't do anything with a lead-off double last inning. If we can't do anything with a lead-off triple, then there's a problem."
whitesox,3c4ate,sevelev711,2,Sat Jul 4 19:37:47 2015 UTC,2 runs on 10 hits through 5. Even when this team is playing well they are playing bad.
whitesox,3c4ate,sevelev711,2,Sat Jul 4 19:38:44 2015 UTC,Well that was a productive strikeout.
whitesox,3c4ate,lincolnparknative,2,Sat Jul 4 19:51:41 2015 UTC,"Wait, no, why would you leave Shark in? That's a bad strat, Robbin."
whitesox,3c4ate,thegreystash,4,Sat Jul 4 20:04:51 2015 UTC,at least they got the bullpen going this time
whitesox,3c4ate,drinkbeerneverfear,4,Sat Jul 4 20:31:58 2015 UTC,"Hey, not to be a jerk, but you guys haven't updated your AL Central Standings in 25 days. lol.   Nice win though."

whitesox,3c4ate,callmeroo,-5,Sat Jul 4 20:56:03 2015 UTC,lol @ the White Sox. Just lol. Your bullpen couldn't get out high school hitters consistently.
whitesox,3c4ate,lincolnparknative,4,Sat Jul 4 20:56:40 2015 UTC,"What are you talking about our bullpen has been one of our strengths this year, Putnam made a mistake to one of the best hitters in baseball."
whitesox,3c4ate,Vikingfanant,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:41:57 2015 UTC,Our bullpen consistenly makes mistakes when our starters are doing well. Robertson is our only asset in the bullpen.

whitesox,3c4pk5,arsesox,10,Sat Jul 4 19:31:25 2015 UTC,"Maybe 30,000 because:   There's Buehrle Sale is trying to strike out 10+ batters in his ninth consecutive start, which would be an MLB record It's summer, which means weekday attendance is usually higher"

BTW the $7 upper corner seats are still pretty open if you want to go cheaply. They're $13 online. Don't do stubhub today, it's inflated. Edit and now the weather has gone to suck with heavy thunderstorms starting at 6. Boooo!"
whitesox,3c4pk5,TheMagicalDonkey,2,Mon Jul 6 19:36:44 2015 UTC,I'm going for sure. Sale is worth the price of admission.
whitesox,3c4pk5,ricker182,2,Sat Jul 4 22:11:50 2015 UTC,"Not placing a number on it, but I'm guessing it'll be close to top attendance of the season, even being a monday. With Buehrle being back, Sale on his streak and the team doing well, it's gonna be as packed as we'll see so far this year.   I'm going in for my first game. It's too good of a matchup to pass up."

Even if Sale doesn't hit the double-digit mark on Monday, he's already in the record books.

whitesox,3c1p50,froglegs_jackson,4,Sat Jul 4 00:51:43 2015 UTC,Switching out Sanchez for Micah isn't going to do dick for our season other than piss off our pitching staff for having someone that can't make routine plays at 2nd. I'd rather have him brush up his D in the minors away from the stench of this losing ballclub. Sending our best prospect up and down and up and down is just going to confuse him anyway.
whitesox,3c1p50,socklessmoejohnson,2,Sat Jul 4 00:54:10 2015 UTC,You can defend Sanchez all you want but he is VERY raw at the plate.    This team needs hitting.
whitesox,3c1p50,ricker182,3,Sat Jul 4 00:56:17 2015 UTC,You could also argue letting Sanchez struggle this badly is bad for his development. Let him go back to AAA where he's had success before and hope he can make some improvements.
whitesox,3c1p50,froglegs_jackson,3,Sat Jul 4 00:57:18 2015 UTC,Exactly. He's destroying any confidence he has right now.

whitesox,3c1p50,froglegs_jackson,2,Sat Jul 4 01:05:51 2015 UTC,Yes. We'll see when he tires out what his stuff is like. I'd keep an eye on the 5th and 6th innings.

whitesox,3byj6y,TheManInsideMe,3,Fri Jul 3 13:24:21 2015 UTC,I wouldn't want to trade Q for Puig. He's a hugely underrated pitcher with a super team-friendly contract and is still young. And I don't think the Dodgers would want Samardzija with the year he's had. We might have some young arms that could be part of the deal. I wouldn't mind including Erik Johnson who was highly touted in a move. We would have a bit of a  crowded OF if we get Puig.  I just don't see a trade really working out unless there was a three team deal and there was someone else giving up a pitcher to the Dodgers too. And then we would send Melky or Adam away too. I don't know.

whitesox,3bx7ha,whitesox20051,0,Thu Jul 2 22:07:39 2015 UTC,"I know the White Sox will give him every opportunity to stick at SS, but does anyone believe he'll be a long term solution? He's showing he can hit for average & run well, but nothing else. Still a lot questions about his defense and arm. If the White Sox are willing to play Sanchez and his low average over Micah, I think that says something about what they prioritize."
whitesox,3bx7ha,JBProds,2,Thu Jul 2 22:32:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah over .300 in only 27 games meanwhile his .176 average over 42 games isn't promising. Micah is hitting .290 in 41 MiLB games while his .270 average in 27 MLB games wasn't even bad. He actually had the second highest batting average at the time.  Combine stats from both AAA & MLB, Sanchez is hitting .260 while Micah is hitting .284. Of course Sanchez has played more MLB games, but his defense is the only reason they've been more patient with him as opposed to Micah where they pulled the plug prematurely. With how much worse the White Sox are at hitting than playing defense, I'm not sure why Micah is still in AAA. Like I mentioned earlier, the front office might prefer defense over offense right now for some reason."
whitesox,3bx7ha,JBProds,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:54:04 2015 UTC,I don't think they pulled the plug on Johnson prematurely. I think what was premature was putting him out there to start the season before they were sure he'd be able to glove enough to stick for good.   Johnson was very bad defensively up here. Just because he had one of the best batting averages among a lame group of hitters doesn't mean his offense was compensating for what he wasn't doing on defense.
whitesox,3bx7ha,ChrisPummer,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:02:02 2015 UTC,"One can argue that Sanchez's bat has hurt the team more than Micah's defense. Sanchez has been an upgrade defensively, but his glove hasn't been that good to justify his hitting. You wrote that it didn't matter that Micah's batting average was one of the best among a lame group of hitters, but the same can be said defensively. This team is still dead last in the MLB defensively. If the team is going to be terrible on the defensive side, the only thing they can do is try to score some runs because it's not like the defense is going to help the pitchers prevent runs."

whitesox,3bvlp9,waff1ez,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:23:20 2015 UTC,Well said.
whitesox,3bvlp9,ACSimeon,3,Thu Jul 2 19:45:59 2015 UTC,"Be patient. Hopefully the White Sox do not go over their spending this year, so they can sign Abraham Gutierrez next year or Kevin Maitan.   Matian has been labeled by Kiley McDaniel to be the best international prospect since Miguel Cabrera who scouts frequently compare him to. And Gutierrez is a young, power hitting catcher who has been hailed by scouts and trainers as the next Mike Piazza.   With that being said, they have interest in Eddy Julio Martinez who is said to command Yoan Moncada type of money. If the #2 prospect received 16 million dollar bonus, imagine how much a player that is considered to be the next Andruw Jones will cost? He's also said to be a 30/30 guy that sometimes looks like Trout. The Sox are already getting close to their 3.4 million dollar. I say if they're gonna over spend and be penalized, they should do what other teams do and sign multiple players next season as opposed to going over this year on one player. If they had signed the top picks then I'd say go after Martinez, but the White Sox top signing was ranked #27"
whitesox,3bvlp9,JBProds,2,Thu Jul 2 22:18:16 2015 UTC,"Article was updated, Sox now have five signees on there. Bonuses known for three so far."

The team doesn't seem to know how to catch a ball."

whitesox,3bt7pp,NineduceXII,2,Thu Jul 2 05:56:33 2015 UTC,Anyone interested in Delmon Young? I'd like to see him on our team. He's only 29 going on 30 and he could be used as a true DH.
whitesox,3bt7pp,bababooey55,2,Wed Jul 1 23:32:14 2015 UTC,meh I don't think he'd be too much of an upgrade if any over LaRoche.
whitesox,3bt7pp,TheCity95,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:15:04 2015 UTC,He's only 29? Wow. I thought he was like 35 for some reason.  I guess it couldn't hurt but I don't really see the point this season with LaRoche still on the team (because there's no way in hell Robin is going to pull him out of the lineup).
whitesox,3bt7pp,_Gunslinger_,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:19:53 2015 UTC,His name ain't young for nothing. Lol.  That's true but laroche is ass. And having a true DH to play for laroche isn't a bad idea.  When Abreu is at 1st have Young DH and when LaRoche is at 1st have Abreu DH.
whitesox,3bt7pp,Thats-WhatShe-Said_,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:32:03 2015 UTC,I would like to see that but no way in hell this stubborn management sits LaRoche with the contract he just signed. He's struggled and he's not flashy but his OBP is fine and his WAR is better than the vast majority of the team.
whitesox,3bt7pp,ZeldaFreak1000,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:24:16 2015 UTC,Delmon will come Cheap. Since he's DFA'd we could trade them someone.. Maybe LaRoche?
whitesox,3bt7pp,chocoholicsoxfan,2,Thu Jul 2 02:09:06 2015 UTC,"Meh, not sure how trade-able he is being, but it's certainly a thought. That would be the only option really as there's no way Abreu, LaRoche, and Young are all on the same team."

whitesox,3bt7pp,chocoholicsoxfan,2,Thu Jul 2 05:15:43 2015 UTC,FOR THE WATCH.
whitesox,3bt7pp,75MillionForks,2,Thu Jul 2 05:21:15 2015 UTC,His major league debut is against Jose Abreu with no outs and the bases loaded in a save situation.   I guess you could say there's a little bit of pressure.
whitesox,3bt7pp,samlincoln,2,Thu Jul 2 05:25:03 2015 UTC,Lol the Cardinals have been so damn good the rest of baseball is going to notice this.

His complaining to the umps do when he complains that he tagged a base stealer out, when it's clear in the instant replay that he lifts the tag before he touches the player. Or when he doesn't swing at a ball right down the middle for strike 3 and then makes faces at the ump.(I guess the latter does count as his hitting, but I am talking more about his arguing when he is wrong all the time)  I feel like what I said above happens at least 2-3 times a week."

whitesox,3br1ri,Unknownentity7,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:48:52 2015 UTC,"I give the slight edge to Keuchel here. I know Sale blows him away in the advanced metrics, but he's on the division-leading Astros, he leads the league in wins, and he has almost a full-point lead in ERA plus a 21 inning lead in IP.  I know wins for pitchers are crap, and outside of that one horrendous start against the Twins Sale's ERA is similar to Keuchel's, but I just think the ERA+innings gap is slightly too large right now."

whitesox,3box34,leg451,5,Wed Jul 1 02:07:54 2015 UTC,Chris is seriously legendary. Thank goodness we get to watch him play for the Sox.
whitesox,3box34,RustyShackleford___,6,Wed Jul 1 02:09:47 2015 UTC,"Meanwhile, Chris Sale's batting average is better than Carlos Sanchez's"
whitesox,3box34,epictrole,5,Wed Jul 1 02:26:22 2015 UTC,"That whole sequence was a perfect summation of this season.  Robin tells Melky to bunt. Pops it up.  Avi. Pops it up.  Gillaspe pulled for Gordon ""how I use bat"" Beckham. Strikes out looking.  All while Abreu looks lonely on first base."
whitesox,3box34,CheddarGuevara,3,Wed Jul 1 02:33:59 2015 UTC,"Because he's a fucking idiot, that's why."
whitesox,3box34,epictrole,2,Wed Jul 1 02:38:15 2015 UTC,"Because he's Robin, the manager who has ""only gotten exponentially better"""
whitesox,3box34,CheddarGuevara,6,Wed Jul 1 02:38:43 2015 UTC,Without Sale or Abreu this game is 8-0.
whitesox,3box34,bababooey55,7,Wed Jul 1 03:06:16 2015 UTC,Sale out; I'm out. Don't need to watch yet another late inning loss.
whitesox,3box34,zgwarnki,3,Wed Jul 1 02:45:30 2015 UTC,Looked like he walked back out?  Edit nevermind
whitesox,3box34,MustacheMark,2,Wed Jul 1 02:53:55 2015 UTC,They pinched LaRoche for him. He's done.
whitesox,3box34,ACSimeon,3,Wed Jul 1 02:54:40 2015 UTC,Didn't realize that until after I said that. Sorry!
whitesox,3box34,MustacheMark,7,Wed Jul 1 02:55:25 2015 UTC,4ks for Eaton. Awful.
whitesox,3box34,ricker182,4,Wed Jul 1 03:01:56 2015 UTC,I hate this team.
whitesox,3box34,chocoholicsoxfan,4,Wed Jul 1 02:54:52 2015 UTC,AND THIS BALLGAME IS OVAAAA~
whitesox,3box34,ZeldaFreak1000,4,Wed Jul 1 02:54:56 2015 UTC,Got my hopes up right there at the end.  Sale was killer tonight!  See you guys tomorrow!
whitesox,3box34,1859,3,Wed Jul 1 03:50:08 2015 UTC,Talk about intense.
whitesox,3box34,MustacheMark,4,Wed Jul 1 03:51:13 2015 UTC,Chris Sale is the best pitcher in baseball right now. That's for sure.
whitesox,3box34,ricker182,10,Wed Jul 1 03:51:59 2015 UTC,"Damn, Flowers!  Clutch for the ""good guys""!  Time to see if we can answer back."
whitesox,3box34,1859,8,Wed Jul 1 03:51:28 2015 UTC,Why are you bastards downvoting the poor guy? He's being nice!
whitesox,3box34,chocoholicsoxfan,5,Wed Jul 1 03:38:01 2015 UTC,We get some troll traffic thru here
whitesox,3box34,samlincoln,4,Wed Jul 1 03:39:33 2015 UTC,I don't even know what to say to that anymore because it happens all the time. I knew we weren't gonna get any runs as soon as flowers came up to bat with Sanchez behind him.
whitesox,3box34,NineduceXII,4,Wed Jul 1 03:41:31 2015 UTC,"It should be impossible for a team with Chris Sale, Jose Abreu, and Jose Quintana to be this bad. But then you look at the rest of this roster.."
whitesox,3box34,froglegs_jackson,4,Wed Jul 1 00:39:28 2015 UTC,"It should be impossible for Melky Cabrera, Adam LaRoche & Jeff Samardzija to be this bad. They were professional baseball players last season. This season they seem to be playing a different sport entirely."
whitesox,3box34,ACSimeon,4,Wed Jul 1 00:42:09 2015 UTC,I'd rather see Beckham play than Sanchez. That's saying a lot too.
whitesox,3box34,ricker182,3,Wed Jul 1 00:45:46 2015 UTC,"We will never see anyone like this pitch for the White Sox again. Enjoy it, guys. This is greatness."
whitesox,3box34,froglegs_jackson,4,Wed Jul 1 00:44:49 2015 UTC,Hawk just sounds like he's in despair now.
whitesox,3box34,PigFarmington,4,Wed Jul 1 01:08:35 2015 UTC,Much like Bob Uecker in Major league.
whitesox,3box34,MustacheMark,3,Wed Jul 1 01:35:29 2015 UTC,"Did you catch how he called Eaton doing down, 1 2 3?  All he literally said was, ""That's one. That's 2. Aaaaaand that's 3."""
whitesox,3box34,PigFarmington,2,Wed Jul 1 01:43:29 2015 UTC,Yeah. You know its bad when even Hawk is depressed. No energy in his calls anymore.
whitesox,3box34,MustacheMark,4,Wed Jul 1 01:51:10 2015 UTC,Chris Sale is unbelievable.
whitesox,3box34,ricker182,5,Wed Jul 1 01:53:31 2015 UTC,Chris Sale is the fucking man!!! It's so depressing that our shitty offense can't put up 2 runs for him.
whitesox,3box34,doyouevenIift,3,Wed Jul 1 02:44:07 2015 UTC,Don't forget Chris scored the only run
whitesox,3box34,NineduceXII,3,Wed Jul 1 02:46:51 2015 UTC,Bring Johnson back up and have him hit leadoff. Adam 2nd.
whitesox,3box34,ricker182,2,Wed Jul 1 02:50:06 2015 UTC,I agree.
whitesox,3box34,epictrole,2,Wed Jul 1 02:56:30 2015 UTC,Nah man. Sanchez's .160 batting average and mediocre defense is too valuable.
whitesox,3box34,epictrole,4,Wed Jul 1 02:56:56 2015 UTC,"Beckham-Alexei-Flowers due up  Prepare yourselves, another 1-2-3 inning is coming"
whitesox,3box34,chocoholicsoxfan,7,Wed Jul 1 02:57:53 2015 UTC,I would laugh so hard if Tyler hit one out.
whitesox,3box34,epictrole,2,Wed Jul 1 03:27:30 2015 UTC,lmfao are you a wizard
whitesox,3box34,drinkbeerneverfear,3,Wed Jul 1 03:32:03 2015 UTC,Go you!!!!! Get laughing

whitesox,3box34,ZeldaFreak1000,4,Wed Jul 1 03:33:49 2015 UTC,Here comes D-Rob.
whitesox,3box34,AgentBartowski,4,Wed Jul 1 03:36:47 2015 UTC,C'mon D-Rob! Slam the door
whitesox,3box34,ACSimeon,3,Wed Jul 1 03:39:36 2015 UTC,This is just classic.
whitesox,3box34,ricker182,3,Wed Jul 1 03:40:31 2015 UTC,CLASSIC HOODINI: SOX WIN!
whitesox,3box34,samlincoln,4,Wed Jul 1 03:46:40 2015 UTC,THROW THE HOOK AND DON'T HANG IT!
whitesox,3box34,OpSecAccount,4,Wed Jul 1 03:50:14 2015 UTC,Wow I'm happy. Should be another thread about Sale when I check /r/baseball
whitesox,3box34,thinkalto,4,Wed Jul 1 03:48:58 2015 UTC,SALLELUJAH
whitesox,3box34,ricker182,3,Wed Jul 1 03:50:35 2015 UTC,"I always come to this sub ready to poop on the Good Guys in the game thread, and then I get here, and I never have the heart to do it. I feel like this is going to be the 2014 Bears going to Lambeau, but I don't want to just write off any of our guys making a big enough turnaround to make this a pivotal series.  So, far from any jaded or naive predictions, I'll just say Go Sox!"
whitesox,3box34,ACSimeon,3,Wed Jul 1 04:04:16 2015 UTC,"Dear God, please bring Micah back. Please. I'll take his sub par defense."
whitesox,3box34,waff1ez,3,Wed Jul 1 00:14:30 2015 UTC,I was just about to complain about the DH rule not being league-wide. Chris Sale is a god though.
whitesox,3box34,bababooey55,3,Wed Jul 1 00:37:18 2015 UTC,I wonder if he can play catcher..
whitesox,3box34,Aperture-Employee,3,Wed Jul 1 00:51:08 2015 UTC,So 3 of the top 6 batting averages on our team are either a pitcher or a guy in the minors.
whitesox,3box34,froglegs_jackson,3,Wed Jul 1 00:54:25 2015 UTC,Guys Chris Sale is kinda good
whitesox,3box34,thinkalto,3,Wed Jul 1 01:01:35 2015 UTC,A pitcher having to face Chris Sale is not even fair.
whitesox,3box34,Aperture-Employee,3,Wed Jul 1 01:04:07 2015 UTC,"I'm watching as MLB.tv's Free Game of the Day, so I'm on the St. Louis broadcast. Their crew actually just said ""He gone!"" My heart swelled a little. But that may have been the bacon and mushroom calzone I ate for dinner."
whitesox,3box34,PigFarmington,3,Wed Jul 1 01:05:36 2015 UTC,"I went to a Cards game in St. Louis a few weeks ago when they were playing the Tigers, Busch is nice."
whitesox,3box34,Aperture-Employee,3,Wed Jul 1 01:05:59 2015 UTC,"Man... They have a true talent here. When they put guys on base, nobody can hit them in. It must be hard to succeed at getting guys on but never actually doing anything worthy with it."
whitesox,3box34,NineduceXII,3,Wed Jul 1 01:18:46 2015 UTC,"CHRIS SALE OP, NEVER NERF"
whitesox,3box34,waff1ez,3,Wed Jul 1 01:23:50 2015 UTC,"The question is, Has anyone done it 9 times in a row?"
whitesox,3box34,ricker182,3,Wed Jul 1 02:03:45 2015 UTC,"Pedro did it ten times, but it was across two seasons."
whitesox,3box34,froglegs_jackson,2,Wed Jul 1 02:15:15 2015 UTC,the answer will be yes whenever Sale pitches again
whitesox,3box34,ACSimeon,3,Wed Jul 1 02:25:05 2015 UTC,Poor Sale....
whitesox,3box34,zgwarnki,3,Wed Jul 1 02:26:07 2015 UTC,GAAAAAAAAAAAAS.
whitesox,3box34,drinkbeerneverfear,3,Wed Jul 1 02:24:57 2015 UTC,CHRIS SALE DOES NOT SUCK!
whitesox,3box34,epictrole,3,Wed Jul 1 02:43:15 2015 UTC,Can't believe I am so happy that Sale wont get a L tonight.
whitesox,3box34,drinkbeerneverfear,3,Wed Jul 1 02:43:38 2015 UTC,Based Chris Sale deserves a win
whitesox,3box34,samlincoln,3,Wed Jul 1 02:44:35 2015 UTC,"Does Robin legitimately even do anything in these games? Every time the camera pans to him he's not talking to anyone, not doing anything. He's just....there."
whitesox,3box34,epictrole,3,Wed Jul 1 03:05:36 2015 UTC,He breathes
whitesox,3box34,ChiTownSox,3,Wed Jul 1 03:09:06 2015 UTC,"He would have put up the best WAR on the 2013 team (just checked, damn he'd be the best player in his prime by far on most of the teams he coached) and maybe this one as a player for some years. Should have retired as a player though.   Yep. 8 seasons where he had a better fWAR than the best player on the team he coached in 2013, and perhaps this one. Hopefully his legacy is better than a shit coach and Ryan's punching bag."
whitesox,3box34,drinkbeerneverfear,3,Wed Jul 1 03:12:29 2015 UTC,And it begins

whitesox,3box34,NineduceXII,3,Wed Jul 1 03:15:32 2015 UTC,Two strikes now lets get him!
whitesox,3box34,AgentBartowski,3,Wed Jul 1 03:35:43 2015 UTC,YOU'RE GODDAMN RIGHT
whitesox,3box34,ADS94,3,Wed Jul 1 03:36:15 2015 UTC,Thank Sale. Without his baserunning skills we would have lost.
whitesox,3box34,DundahMifflin,3,Wed Jul 1 03:48:59 2015 UTC,YEEEES!!!! HELL YES!!!!
whitesox,3box34,MustacheMark,3,Wed Jul 1 03:49:36 2015 UTC,"And that ballgame is OVER. We didn't play the best, but we beat the best. Great game by Chris Sale, good day to be a White Sox fan. Let's hope they celebrate this win"
whitesox,3box34,chocoholicsoxfan,3,Wed Jul 1 03:49:55 2015 UTC,"Good game, guys! Weird night for both of us, but still a ton of fun."
whitesox,3box34,MustacheMark,3,Wed Jul 1 03:49:57 2015 UTC,"Chris Sale deserved a win, but I'll take this too"
whitesox,3box34,ricker182,5,Wed Jul 1 03:51:12 2015 UTC,Here's a thought I just had. What do you guys think of benching Ramirez and starting Beckham at short? Connor at third. At least to try because Alexei is awful.
whitesox,3box34,MustacheMark,5,Wed Jul 1 03:54:05 2015 UTC,I called that.
whitesox,3box34,ADS94,5,Wed Jul 1 03:54:06 2015 UTC,Yeah you did. Excellent job.
whitesox,3box34,samlincoln,4,Wed Jul 1 01:20:14 2015 UTC,"Why does Sanchez even start?       His defense is okay, but his hitting is as raw as a green banana or a butt hole after the pride parade. Whatever analogy floats your boat."
whitesox,3box34,BetterThanAFoon,3,Wed Jul 1 03:36:36 2015 UTC,I liked the banana one. But I agree. Second base is the easier position to field in the infield. We can give up some defense there for a little more offense.
whitesox,3box34,samlincoln,4,Wed Jul 1 03:37:44 2015 UTC,"Oh good, you got it right this time.  Anyone else ready to get absolutely murdered?"
whitesox,3box34,bababooey55,6,Wed Jul 1 03:38:50 2015 UTC,Not with Sale. But yeah the next two nights. Baseball is weird though. I think even Cardinals fans will tell you they are outplaying their record.
whitesox,3box34,NineduceXII,6,Wed Jul 1 03:41:17 2015 UTC,Checking in from Busch. Hope for a great series. Lets go RedBirds.
whitesox,3box34,thinkalto,2,Tue Jun 30 23:26:07 2015 UTC,I wanted to go. Same with PNC. STOP SCHEDULING INTERLEAGUE GAMES DURING THE WEEK.
whitesox,3box34,samlincoln,2,Tue Jun 30 23:56:22 2015 UTC,Might not even have tuned in if Sale wasn't pitching. Would rather do work.
whitesox,3box34,LJ_K,2,Tue Jun 30 23:35:24 2015 UTC,Strike zone is wonky
whitesox,3box34,doyouevenIift,2,Tue Jun 30 23:57:38 2015 UTC,"I know those Ks count the same as anybody else's. But they just look so beautiful, so unpredictable, each a gem. I actually forget my anger about this season when Sale is on the mound."
whitesox,3box34,NineduceXII,3,Wed Jul 1 00:18:37 2015 UTC,Sometimes I laugh when he's pitching. I just laugh at the opposing hitters try.
whitesox,3box34,waff1ez,2,Wed Jul 1 00:19:48 2015 UTC,That Chris Sale hit was the best thing I've seen all year from this team
whitesox,3box34,RustyShackleford___,2,Wed Jul 1 00:24:42 2015 UTC,Hopefully these guys seeing Chris get a hit kicks their asses into gear. Or probably not.
whitesox,3box34,PigFarmington,2,Wed Jul 1 00:27:50 2015 UTC,Anyone wonder why the NL always has the team with the most wins every year?
whitesox,3box34,samlincoln,3,Wed Jul 1 00:50:39 2015 UTC,I'd guess the average NL team has a better bench.  They rely more on pinch hitters than the AL ever will so you have fewer holes in your roster.  They aren't afraid to play small ball.
whitesox,3box34,NineduceXII,2,Wed Jul 1 00:50:59 2015 UTC,Christ Mo-effin Sale

whitesox,3box34,froglegs_jackson,2,Wed Jul 1 01:56:55 2015 UTC,I can't tell if Hawk is being serious about the authenricators

whitesox,3box34,NineduceXII,2,Wed Jul 1 02:54:51 2015 UTC,Place your bets on how the Sox blow it tonight!!!  I'm guessing walk off homer

whitesox,3box34,1859,2,Wed Jul 1 03:02:27 2015 UTC,Line drive scores the runner from second. Bonus if winning run is a walk.

whitesox,3box34,chocoholicsoxfan,2,Wed Jul 1 03:04:26 2015 UTC,Am I honestly a terrible fan for hoping we go on another long losing streak so maybe JUST MAYBE we'd finally get rid of Robin?  Addition by subtraction baby

whitesox,3bmfen,whitesox20051,4,Tue Jun 30 12:01:01 2015 UTC,"I think it's worth pointing out to people who think the Sox should trade Sale that a player as great as he is gives you a reason to still pay attention at least once every five days, even in a season like this. You don't watch because something incredible might happen, you watch because when he pitches something incredible is happening.   There's just not a return out there to match what Sale does for this team in the quantifiable ways, much less the intangible ways."
whitesox,3bmfen,ChrisPummer,2,Tue Jun 30 13:18:59 2015 UTC,"What makes me mad is that nobody on the Sox (management or players) seems to care. ""We suck...doesn't matter got paid"" seems to be the prevailing attitude. I know Ozzie went a little crazy, but at least he would get fired up.   It disappoints me greatly that this team, at least in public, doesn't seem to care they are terrible."

whitesox,3bfk06,ricker182,7,Sun Jun 28 20:06:54 2015 UTC,I saw a stat the other day that showed the Sox leave their starters out there longer than any other team in the mlb. The stat was to show how the Royals and Rays are so successful because they almost always pull their starters before the offense sees them a third time.
whitesox,3bfk06,alexc1234,-14,Sun Jun 28 20:31:53 2015 UTC,"Blah blah blah. The starters are the strength of the team. The Rays have dealt with arm injury after arm injury babying their arms. The White Sox have been the healthiest pitching staff in baseball - by a lot - over the past 20 years. I'll trust what they're doing works from a health standpoint.  The Royals have the best bullpen in the history of the game, so of course it's more effective to pull their starters that are middle of the pack at best.   The White Sox strength is their rotation and there's nothing wrong with leaving them out there while they're running good."
whitesox,3bfk06,WSOXFAN22,15,Sun Jun 28 20:47:26 2015 UTC,"The problem is leaving them out there until it's too late. Like today. That's the problem and it happens regularly.

whitesox,3bfk06,chocoholicsoxfan,5,Mon Jun 29 01:39:16 2015 UTC,I kind of feeling like crying and vomiting at the same time.
whitesox,3bfk06,JROremus,2,Sun Jun 28 20:23:15 2015 UTC,Way ahead of you man. It was so brutal to watch
whitesox,3bfk06,froglegs_jackson,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:39:12 2015 UTC,sounds like my typical evening after a night of champagne and a date from Craigslist.
whitesox,3bfk06,dhcrazy333,7,Mon Jun 29 15:32:03 2015 UTC,"So much outrage about Ventura, but (practically) no one is saying anything about the people that built this roster. I don't get it. The problems with this organization go well beyond Robin."
whitesox,3bfk06,ggslovin,20,Sun Jun 28 20:06:10 2015 UTC,"Everyone thought the White Sox won the offseason- scouts and experts for every team. I don't think you can really blame them. A year ago at this time, Alexei was going to the All Star Game, Abreu was winning player of the month and hitting home run after home run, Eaton was batting over .300, Gillaspie felt like a guaranteed man on base... Our only woes seemed to be Viciedo, De Aza, and the bullpen.   I don't think you can blame Hahn for the way the players are performing."
whitesox,3bfk06,dhcrazy333,4,Sun Jun 28 20:21:29 2015 UTC,I wouldn't personally include Gillaspie as a positive last year. He had a bad second half and it was pretty obvious he was going to regress.
whitesox,3bfk06,ggslovin,2,Sun Jun 28 22:12:09 2015 UTC,"That's true, which is why I said a year ago today. But it's just another example of a shitty thing gone wrong this season."
whitesox,3bfk06,WSOXFAN22,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:01:04 2015 UTC,"Didn't see the ""at this time"". Still though, his BABIP was ridiculously high."
whitesox,3bfk06,PigFarmington,2,Sun Jun 28 23:13:46 2015 UTC,"It isn't about just this season. Hahn and KW have been the top 2 decision makers in this organization for 10+ years, and KW specifically has been one of the top 2 decision makers since 2000. In that time span the White Sox have made the playoffs twice. And if we're being honest, they only made it in 2008 because they were fortunate enough to be in a bad division and won a 1 game playoff. That shouldn't be good enough. In any other organization in sports, 2 playoff appearances in 15 years (and it's not like they're even close to being a competitive team) would get you fired. But when Jerry Reinsdorf owns the team, you have a job for life. I just don't see how anyone can say the members of the White Sox FO have earned the right to try and fix this mess."
whitesox,3bfk06,samurai5625,6,Sun Jun 28 21:27:40 2015 UTC,The White Sox made all the right moves in the off season. Addressed every single one of their needs with proven players except for fixing our awful catcher. Nobody could have predicted basically everyone would have their worst seasons of their careers.
whitesox,3bfk06,weasol12,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:43:58 2015 UTC,"Besides catcher, they didn't address the back of the rotation, 3rd base, 2nd base, and the decline of the SS. This team had major holes coming into the season. And they gave up draft picks to sign temporary plugs to other gaping holes."
whitesox,3bfk06,PigFarmington,2,Mon Jun 29 14:25:45 2015 UTC,"There was no indication SS would be such a problem this year, 2b and 3b were not anticipated to be this bad. Not great but not this bad.   Idk how you can say they didn't address the back end of the rotation, danks as a number 5 starter, while not good by any means, is the only hole."
whitesox,3bfk06,whitesox20051,0,Mon Jun 29 14:41:23 2015 UTC,SS- Yes there was. Alexei was definitely hitting the age for regression at his position.    3B- Conor was replacement level last season with a below average glove and no power at a power position. Slap hitting won't cut it.   2B- Okay.   Back end of the rotation- Danks and Noesi had 2 of the worst 10 xFIP in all the majors last season. We knew they were both absolutely terrible. Now Noesi is gone and Danks is back to being one of the worst dozen pitchers in the majors.    Everybody keeps piling on Flowers who has shown he sucks as well. But there were massive holes coming into this season and now they're glaring for everyone to see. The Sox simply pulled the trigger too early on trying to get this team to contention and they're paying for it.
whitesox,3bfk06,DaaaBears91,5,Mon Jun 29 15:46:43 2015 UTC,"Hahn is one of the sharpest minds in baseball; every organization wanted at him when he was the assistant GM for the White Sox. He has his hands tied by an organization that feels the need to try and compete every single year even if it may not be ideal.   I don't think Hahn's MO is signing a bunch of free agents, but the White Sox as an organization can afford to tank seasons."

whitesox,3bfk06,TripleCrown90,2,Sun Jun 28 21:17:50 2015 UTC,"He's also known to go back on his word quick. ""McCarthy is the future of our rotation."" Trades away. ""Brian Anderson is the future of our outfield."" DFA. ""Dayan Viciedo has loads of potential."" DFA. ""Gordon Beckham is our third baseman."" Plays second the next three years. Can't trust anything he says."

whitesox,3bfk06,WSOXFAN22,2,Mon Jun 29 12:43:30 2015 UTC,"I know everybody likes to blame the manager when times are tough but we actually have a reason to.

Not bringing that guy in after he loaded the bases with 0 out and then hit a guy. Testing your luck again by keeping him in after Cabrera.   Amazing.

Then in the off season you go out and put a lot of money (and draft picks) into acquiring proven veterans to help this team win.  All these new guys.. from all over the place.. are continuing to have the same issues that have plagued this team (but different players) for years.  Poor defense, forgetting to bring their bats to.. at bats, poor base running.. what is it then kenny?  The guys you brought in received brain damage when they signed on the dotted line?  This merry-go-round this front office is keeping us in is maddening.  Maybe it IS all the players fault.. but saying for months that ""we're hoping they figure things out"" isn't exactly what fans want to hear.    Heads need to roll in this organization and I think Williams should be the first to go."

whitesox,3ba88u,Fyrezerk,13,Sat Jun 27 13:34:10 2015 UTC,"This upsets me mostly because I have seen no evidence of progress in Ventura. He makes awful decisions with the bullpen constantly, doesn't seem to know when to bunt, and our team consistently makes basic errors. We don't seem to do the fundamentals well, and I think that falls on the manager.  We have gotten better tools this season, but seem to be doing worse. Historic levels of bad offense with better players. That's not an exaggeration. Every single player is playing worse than their career averages. Are we to blame each player singularly? As if they all happened to play below their averages this year.  Or, maybe only one person is to blame. The man in charge of making sure all these players play well.  How did Adam Eaton go from being the spark plug, to quitting on a ground ball twice in one play? How is there no discipline for this?  I also want to bring up Todd Steverson in the conversation because I haven't really heard his name mentioned. For years, we had the awful Greg Walker as our hitting coach and we never seemed to have a plan at the plate. I had a lot of hope for Steverson because he came from a smart organization in the A's and I assumed we would have better at bats. It's only gotten worse this season, and I can't for the life of me understand why or how."
whitesox,3ba88u,TheStroomis,5,Sat Jun 27 07:10:56 2015 UTC,"You worded this perfectly. I really think the majority of people underestimate the importance of MLB managers. There's a reason why a guy like Maddon was able to lead one of the smallest market teams to multiple winning seasons,  and why a guy like Ventura is getting the same shit results every year, despite his team having been upgraded with free agents. He's incompetent as a manager."
whitesox,3ba88u,ggslovin,2,Sat Jun 27 22:57:29 2015 UTC,I have a little trouble blaming Steverson. He preaches patience and telling the hitters not to just flail away at everything like Greg Walker or (shudder) Jeff Manto. I wonder if this is just a mixture of some players not listening to him and others just not having the ability to hit at the major league level.

whitesox,3ba88u,Lana_Phrasing,4,Sat Jun 27 16:13:01 2015 UTC,"it's about time people stop acting like the Danks signing at the time was not a good deal.    It wasn't, even at the time.   He signed the deal in the winter of 2011 to avoid arbitration, after a campaign in '11 that saw him throw his fewest innings in four years, strike out the fewest batters in four years as a starter, post his highest WHIP in four years, as well as his lowest (read: worst) ERA+ in the same time frame.   He was only 26, but at the time of the signing he was firmly in the average of 3rd or 4th starters in the MLB, and Kenny Williams decided that was worth 14-15M+ per year.  And on top of all of that...the deal was tendered not to stave off free agency, but arbitration. Kenny chose not to see if Danks could bounce back from his quite pedestrian outing with an arb year, and gambled with a long-term, big-money deal for someone of questionable long-term talent. He lost, it is, and was then, a bad deal."

whitesox,3ba88u,4cornerhustler,1 point,Sat Jun 27 12:38:45 2015 UTC,"I don't think firing him now will make much of a difference, and the Sox have always tried to avoid firing managers mid-season. This is a classic Terry Bevington/Jerry Manuel situation- everyone knows they're going in a new direction, but they'll wait til the offseason.

whitesox,3b8szm,ricker182,-2,Sat Jun 27 01:55:53 2015 UTC,Right...... Cause Robin doesn't already do that...... Gotta be because the manager doesn't do enough practice drills. that makes sense
whitesox,3b8szm,ProfSweetness,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:00:01 2015 UTC,You do realize he said they don't practice fundamentals because they should already know them by the time they reach MLB.
whitesox,3b8szm,ricker182,-2,Sat Jun 27 02:05:31 2015 UTC,"You do realize that they're pros and they really shouldn't be practicing ""fundamentals"". How is he wrong? This is professional baseball, not the minors."
whitesox,3b8szm,ProfSweetness,4,Sat Jun 27 02:10:02 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter what level you are or how good you are; you should always practice fundamentals. You think that guys like Konerko, Thomas, Sale, Cabrera, Jeter, or anybody else in the pros just goes ""Ah fuck it, I'm in the majors?"" Does Lebron James, Joakim Noah, and other basketball greats not give a fuck about fundamentals just because there in the pros? Bowlers like Jason Belmonte, Norm Duke, Pete Weber, they shouldn't go over fundamentals when they're in a slump? It doesn't matter what league, what experience, or how good you are, if you're not doing good you need to go over the fundamentals. Every fabric of the sport hangs off of them."
whitesox,3b8szm,Roederoid,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:29:57 2015 UTC,Well seeing as how they can't perform the fundamentals... they should probably practice some fundamentals.
whitesox,3b8szm,bababooey55,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:50:27 2015 UTC,"You seriously think they shouldn't be practicing the basic pieces of their sport? No matter what level you are, you need to do that. Sounds to me like Robin doesn't want to step on any of his players' toes. He doesn't hold anyone accountable publicly. Good mangers do that.       Some guys are doing terrible things and he needs to point that out and practice the fundamentals because a lot of our guys just aren't executing them.     That bunt by Sanchez, right call or not, was atrocious. He needs to practice his bunting for a sizable amount of time a day now if he's not going to hit."
whitesox,3b8szm,ricker182,-1,Sat Jun 27 13:30:19 2015 UTC,"This is not a video game bro. How in the hell do you know how robin goes about his practices? Cause you don't know. People just hold managers accountable cause he's the head guy when in reality this team is just playing like plain garbage right now. Or cause they actually are garbage.    That bunt by Sanchez, right call or not, was atrocious. He needs to practice his bunting for a sizable amount of time a day now if he's not going to hit.   That statement itself explains how simple minded Sox fans can get. Sanchez came up from minors, when he wasn't even really ready for the mlb. To say Robin doesn't go over and point out there flaws and practice at them is mad. Even Garfein said yesterday he saw them bunting yesterday for awhile before the game. Pointing fingers at Robin is so childish, its hilarious watching all of you do it."

I guess living in Minnesota and seeing how fair-weather/clueless about baseball the vast majority of their fans are fuels my hatred, even towards the good fans, which is irrational.  TOP 5 THINGS I HATE ABOUT TWINS FANS   The ones that know nothing about baseball think they know everything about baseball. At games, they think every foul ball is going to be a home run and get mad when it isn't. They still think Joe Mauer is the shit. They don't know anything about players not on the Twins. They cheer more loudly for fans catching foul balls than they do for their fielders robbing home runs. Their stupid jerseys have way too many colors. They've never heard of Jose Abreu. They hate AJ Pierzynski so much for no reason. They blame all their losses on bad officiating. They think the Twins are going to win the WS every year, no matter what. They call Hawks fans bandwagons when they have Wild jerseys on, but this year, when the Twins were actually good, they had to rummage through their old belongings to find their long forgotten Twins gear. They don't see how this makes them hypocrites. JUST BECAUSE JOE MAUER HAS TWINS AND PLAYS FOR THE TWINS, IT DOESN'T MEAN HE'S AMAZING They defend Torii Hunter even when he's being a spoiled baby, and call him a ""classy and respected veteran."" They keep asking me stupid questions during the game. YOU LIVE IN MINNESOTA. PUT A FUCKING ROOF ON YOUR STADIUM.   Woah, that was way more than 5... oh well. I need to go to bed now."

I think most of us are in the same boat that we're optomistic he will be gone at some point but are resigned to the fact that he's probably not going anywhere.

whitesox,3b3z0n,cardsfan1343,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:02:48 2015 UTC,"First off, the onus isn't on me to prove how managers have an effect on the teams that they are managing. I'm saying a ton of variables go into a player's development, and solely accrediting the man putting him in the lineup is short-sighted.  I'll admit I short-changed Neil Paine. Good on him for attempting to quantify something that is largely immeasurable. I'd simply argue that baseball is one of the most cerebral sports an athlete can play, and a lot of baseball players (note: The handful of guys who played at UIC that I bullshitted with) would say a lot of what happens in the dugout is contagious. Everything rubs off on everyone else, soooooooo... When Sox fans see a manager as lethargic as Robin Ventura, going through the motions, lazily arguing with umps every few games, making terrible defensive substitutions (or not making switches at all), it's completely reasonable to think that a manager with a different approach to managing would get more out of these players."
whitesox,3b3z0n,TonyBagadoughnuts,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:23:53 2015 UTC,"When Sox fans see a manager as lethargic as Robin Ventura, going through the motions, lazily arguing with umps every few games, making terrible defensive substitutions (or not making switches at all), it's completely reasonable to think that a manager with a different approach to managing would get more out of these players.   I agree, that is a completely reasonable thing to think. But just because something is reasonable does not mean it is correct. Yet, I actually do think it is correct. Managers undoubtedly have some effect on results. The question then becomes how much of an effect does he have? Are the results he produces better or worse than the results an average MLB manager would produce with the same players? How much is he being paid, and how long is his contract? What would be the cost of a replacement? It's necessary to weigh the costs and the benefits when discussing a hiring/firing decision like this. Just because you or anybody else thinks firing Ventura will produce better results on the field, that does not mean it is what is best for the team if the goal is to reach the playoffs or win a world series as soon as possible.  Let's assume Ventura costs the team 2-3 wins this year in aggregate compared to the expected results if an average manager had these players. That would put him in the bottom 5% of managers all time if we're going with Paine's admittedly imperfect estimates. To bring in an average MLB manager, it costs about 2-3 million per year. MLB manager contract details are usually not public knowledge, but we know some of them. Maddon got $5 million a year with the Cubs, so teams need to shell out for the better managers. Here's a list of all the contracts that are public knowledge. Ventura signed a ""multi-year"" extension in early 2014. His initial contract, which was a 3 year deal, ran through the 2014 season. So the Sox are on the hook for his salary until the end of next season at the least. ""Multi-year"" could very well mean 3 years, and given his initial contract was a 3 year deal, it wouldn't be that unusual. That would mean he's guaranteed his salary through 2017.  So the money owed to Ventura is a sunk cost at this point. The question then becomes whether the benefit of bringing in a new manager is worth the cost. Suppose you fire Ventura today and bring in an average manager for the rest of the season and pay him $750,000. Let's again be super conservative and say he improves our team by 2 wins over the rest of the year. Are those 2 wins worth that money, given our objectives of going to the playoffs and winning a world series as soon as possible? I'd argue they aren't, because there is an extremely slim chance the team will be in any sort of position to have those two extra wins matter by the end of the season. I'd rather save that money and spend it on a player for next year. Let Ventura contribute to a couple more losses, don't throw more money at a dumpster fire of a season. For comparison, Avisail Garcia and Carlos Rodon are making less this year than the projected $750,000 a replacement average manager would cost for this season. We're already out of it this season, why waste the money?  I have no issue with firing Ventura after this season. A new season breeds new hope and a clean slate. I understand and find it completely ""reasonable"" to be upset with the team this year. It's also reasonable to attribute some of the failure to Ventura, and to to think that replacing him will yield better results. However, given my stated objectives for the team, I don't think the ""reasonable"" desire of replacing Ventura immediately is the best way to achieve the objectives."

Both young. Both hungry. Both on the South Side for a LONG time. It's a great time to be alive even if this season has been a disappointment.   I truly believe our offense is ready to bust out and this series is as good a time as any.   Sox-6 Tigers-2  Should be a fun game. I just love watching Rodon toss. Talent like his is something you see once a lifetime if you're lucky.   God bless. Enjoy the game."

Who the Hell is calling the game?  Parent from the dugout?  Flowers ?  No scouting reports? (although ""notorious"" doesn't seem like much of a secret) WTF?  it's not just fielding mental errors.  It's clueless or lazy baseball.  Do they go over a game plan?  Do they review the hitters?  do they use any form of Baseball prep smarts?  I think this is all very deeply rooted.   hope not.  go sox, I still love em."

whitesox,3ayrpd,Petey_Peppers,6,Wed Jun 24 16:24:24 2015 UTC,1-0 well this games over.   We are well on our way. With our pitching and Abreau and Garcia we will be the dominating force in this division for the next 10 years. Slow start be damned. We are the best TEAM in this division. I truly don't think it's close.   God bless.

whitesox,3ayrpd,AnniesBoobzz,2,Wed Jun 24 19:01:30 2015 UTC,This has to be the worst offense/defense combination for a team ever. Chris Sale can't catch a fucking break.
whitesox,3ayrpd,drinkbeerneverfear,2,Wed Jun 24 19:02:36 2015 UTC,Different sport but the Bears have had pretty bad combos. Weeping intensifies

whitesox,3ayrpd,chocoholicsoxfan,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:11:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know. Last start, I legitimately felt bad for him. This time, not soooo much. Every pitcher gets a loss now and again. Even if we were contending, this would be a fair one to get."

whitesox,3ayrpd,ricker182,4,Wed Jun 24 19:30:53 2015 UTC,Sale needs wins too if he wants to win the CY. Our hitters need to help him out.
whitesox,3ayrpd,lincolnparknative,-15,Wed Jun 24 18:36:59 2015 UTC,This is why Sox fans are jokes... how can you honestly argue Sale deserves the cy young so far this year? There's 14 other teams in the AL you might want to pay attention to sometime. This guy named Chris Archer is significantly better than Sale this year.   Years of listening to an escaped mental patient as your announcer has fried all of your brains.
whitesox,3ayrpd,chocoholicsoxfan,3,Wed Jun 24 18:44:53 2015 UTC,"Archer- 16 G, 3.2 fWAR  Sale- 13 G, 3.0 fWAR   Oh yeah, Archer is miles better."
whitesox,3ayrpd,warhawkguy,5,Wed Jun 24 18:55:32 2015 UTC,"First off: there is nothing wrong with pulling for your pitcher to win the CY  Second off: Yes, Chris Archer is having a great year, and not all fans may be aware of it. Does that make them jokes? No way. How can you over generalize an entire fan base on one comment? That's pretty pitiful   Third off: He may be an escaped mental patient, but he is OUR escaped mental patient.  Lastly: And I mean this one, Fuck off buddy. Go spread your hate/bashing somewhere else. Sox may be having a down year, but we'll always back em."
whitesox,3ayrpd,AnDEErew,2,Wed Jun 24 18:50:55 2015 UTC,TIL that Chris Archer is better than Randy Johnson and Pedro Martinez.

I've seen Hawk admit that the Sox caught a break when the umpires missed a call, but those Royals announcers will back their team no matter what.

It's a move to diminish White Sox popularity in general. CBS is in bed with the Cubs. They want them on the Score and off bbm. The only wild card was WGN, but the collusion with the Cubs still exists there. I guarantee it.   So now the Sox are relegated to the station airing Dahl and Rush Limbaugh. It's not hip. You won't hear white sox network. It diminishes their popularity to the masses. I'm not talking about us. The die hards. I'm talking bout Joe Schmo. He hears about the Sox less on radio. Thinks they aren't as a big of a deal and the team gets less shine. They won't do as well doing give aways on 890. It diminishes their foot print in the cosmic consciousness of the city. Less popularity = Less money.   You can say it doesn't matter.

Rather than the result of the machinations of a Tribute/CBS/Cubs cabal, WLS/Cumulus Media obtained the rights to the Sox to help bolster and re-energize the Big 89.  It was WGN's big booming signal across the Midwest that built the Cubs to what they are. By moving from WSCR to WLS, the Sox will have that opportunity, albeit three-quarters of a century too late.  WSCR and WLS are both 50,000 watt AMs, but WSCR has diminished nighttime pattern while WLS is a clear channel (not the company now known as IHeart) AM that booms across the middle of the country bringing Sox game to millions more potential ears that could hear them on WSCR."

Now, what can I listen to if I want to hear talk about the Sox in the morning or on my commute home? All the guys on 670 are Cubs fans as it is (B & B, I think, McNeil and Spiegal, etc.). I've never listened to ESPN 1000, but knowing ESPN, there's no way they're talking Sox or Hawks when they can talk Cubs, Bulls, or Bears.

I really envy those of you who get to participate in Sox events in the area or at the ballpark.

whitesox,3aulel,knightni73,2,Tue Jun 23 17:09:24 2015 UTC,I didn't hear about Hickman needed Tommy John that really sucks. He looked like one of our best picks this draft.
whitesox,3aulel,constapatedape,2,Tue Jun 23 17:39:49 2015 UTC,"He definitely was one of the better picks. The sad part is that their draft in general was terrible aside from Fulmer. A lot of pitchers with high ERAs & hitters with low averages, OBP & SLG at the college level. Sox love drafting their local kids that don't make it to the big league level. Hickman was not impressive in college. His 2.99 ERA looks good, but that's a fairly high ERA for the college level to be drafted this high. He pitched 84.1 innings last season & only struck out 62 and walked 50. That's terrible. He was even worse out of the bullpen last season posting a 3.93 ERA with a 34:23 K to BB ratio. Maybe if he was able to strike out some batters it wouldn't look as bad.  I promise I'm not always so negative, but I just hate the way this team drafts players. I follow every pick from Round 1 to 40. Yes, I know that sounds crazy, but I do. They just suck at evaluating talent & prefer local players as opposed to talented players. They rarely draft good players after round 1 & 2. They actually don't even do a great job drafting in those rounds unless players drop (Sale, Rodon, Adams & Danish) and the pick becomes obvious. This team has ONE position player that was drafted by the Sox & that's Beckham. He's not even a starter. Sale, Petricka & Webb are the only pitchers drafted by them. Everybody wonders why & how the White Sox lack talent in the farm and in the big league club and that's your answer. You have 40 opportunities to add talent yet the White Sox don't take advantage. Well only roughly 15-20 picks have potential to make an impact."
whitesox,3aulel,JBProds,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:36:56 2015 UTC,"Oh I totally agree, I pretty much hated what we did with our draft. Our 4th round pick was a waste, same with our 9th rounder and many later picks (the last pick included, sorry Jerry but we shouldnt have drafted your grandson just to say he was drafted).   I really wish we would take a risk once and a while. I hate that we passed on Skye Bolt, Kade Scivicque or Paul DeJong to take Erwin in the 4th when we really need position players that have a shot at making the big leagues."
whitesox,3aulel,constapatedape,3,Tue Jun 23 20:57:11 2015 UTC,Exactly. Erwin throws 87-91 mph & is a left handed-starter. Do they not see how the rotation already features 3 that'll be there for the next few seasons? Another player they passed on Miami 3B David Thompson. Gillaspie is not the future. He's not even an MLB caliber 3B right now. They also lack power hitters & that's what Thompson is. He hit .333 with 19 HRs & 87 RBIs in 64 games.
whitesox,3aulel,JBProds,2,Tue Jun 23 21:09:49 2015 UTC,Yeah Im really disheartened by our draft class after round 1. If they love going local so much why not take DeJong in the 4th and get a good bat and potential catcher or 3rd baseman.   I think a lot of this might have to do with Kenny having too much influence on the process still. Too many toolsy players over proven performers and too many soft throwing pitchers.
whitesox,3aulel,constapatedape,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:19:09 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I thought they'd select DeJong. The crazy thing is that they preferred Jay over Fulmer. Nothing against Jay, but he only started 2 games out of his 30 college appearances. They definitely needed a RH starter more than LH reliever. I swear they don't see the kind of team they have already."
whitesox,3aulel,JBProds,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:19:14 2015 UTC,Glad they took Fulmer. Jay would have been too big of a reach imo. Fulmer is much more likely to pan out as a starter. As an ISU alumni I'm only a little bitter that we didn't take Dejong.
whitesox,3aulel,constapatedape,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:12:30 2015 UTC,"Jay has looked dominant no doubt, but this team needs that RH starter. I have no affiliation with ISU, but I'm also bitter. He's versatile & he can probably hit better than Flowers right now. The move just made too much sense, so it's no shock to us that they didn't pick him."
whitesox,3aulel,JBProds,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:20:28 2015 UTC,"Just looked on the MiLB First Pitch app, of course DeJong has a RBI in his first at bat. Too much sense for our organization to do the easy thing. Cardinals look like they got another great pick"

whitesox,3ard63,HinduMexican,11,Tue Jun 23 02:39:10 2015 UTC,I don't think putting down a gameboy or getting yelled at makes Carlos Sanchez hit .300 or teaches Alexei how to take a walk.
whitesox,3ard63,ParkerAdderson,8,Mon Jun 22 23:50:17 2015 UTC,"The point was that the team is disengaged and disinterested and has no sense of purpose.  Nobody is pointing them in a direction and motivating them to go.  Sounds like clubhouse rules are lax, whether that creates team discipline or not is debatable.  I'm sure the team doesn't like their poor performance, but I don't think any feel an obligation to really put in the extra work to break out of their slumps or keep their skills sharp."

whitesox,3ard63,PigFarmington,12,Tue Jun 23 02:38:59 2015 UTC,"One of the things I've noticed about this team as a whole, is the lack of caring.    Strike out? Walk back to the bench, laugh it off.  Down 8 in the 9th inning? Having a laugh with the teammates. We'll get them tomorrow. Or not.  It seems like everyone is so damn complacent and we just don't care that we are losing..."

whitesox,3ard63,Cheeky_buggah,3,Mon Jun 22 23:35:22 2015 UTC,"I mean, it was his first ever walk off home run. Especially in the 11th, I'm ok with that."

It's not as bad as how NC State handled Rodon when their team never had a chance to make to the playoffs.   In 12 starts this season, Rodon has notched pitch counts of 115, 116, 121, 125, 132 (last week's effort) and, just two weeks before the Georgia Tech start, 134 over 7 2/3 innings. By way of context, as ESPN's Keith Law points out, among major leaguers, only Tim Lincecum eclipsed 134 pitches in 2013 -- in a no-hitter, it should be noted -- while only four pitchers total have thrown that many in a start since 2010."

whitesox,3arm5x,whitesox20051,2,Tue Jun 23 00:17:48 2015 UTC,"Also, Sean McDonough and Mark Mulder are two others."
whitesox,3arm5x,Georgie56,3,Tue Jun 23 00:21:48 2015 UTC,Espn just ripping our offense as deserved.
whitesox,3arm5x,samlincoln,3,Tue Jun 23 00:23:19 2015 UTC,Can we just sign the Vanderbilt guy right into our starting rotation once the College World Series is over?
whitesox,3arm5x,vikingrunner,6,Tue Jun 23 00:14:29 2015 UTC,"He is pitching right now on ESPN, just saw a great strikeout.   EDIT: and another K, 2 flawless innings."
whitesox,3arm5x,samlincoln,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:23:47 2015 UTC,Because pitching is our major problem /s
whitesox,3arm5x,PigFarmington,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:26:07 2015 UTC,"Danks came back out and threw strikes for a quick inning, can keep it going."
whitesox,3arm5x,samlincoln,3,Tue Jun 23 03:49:51 2015 UTC,Is Alexei high right now
whitesox,3arm5x,mycrows,3,Tue Jun 23 00:59:49 2015 UTC,"Again, fuck this team."
whitesox,3arm5x,Georgie56,3,Tue Jun 23 01:04:25 2015 UTC,Oh shit this is a nationally broadcasted game? Hahaha what the hell is ESPN thinking?
whitesox,3arm5x,bababooey55,2,Tue Jun 23 01:22:49 2015 UTC,At least now everyone gets to see Robin suck live.
whitesox,3arm5x,AnniesBoobzz,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:31:41 2015 UTC,Don't even know why they picked this game anyway.
whitesox,3arm5x,Georgie56,3,Tue Jun 23 01:31:57 2015 UTC,"It really is strange. I saw it got moved to ESPN a few weeks ago, though. Probably when the Twins had the best record in baseball."
whitesox,3arm5x,froglegs_jackson,3,Tue Jun 23 02:34:52 2015 UTC,I don't understand why guys like Erik Johnson and Kottaras still aren't given a shot. What's the worst that can happen at this point?
whitesox,3arm5x,AnniesBoobzz,2,Tue Jun 23 01:33:39 2015 UTC,"I'm not too worried about Johnson, he can benefit from more time in AAA.  Kottaras... no freakin idea why he's not on this ball club right now."
whitesox,3arm5x,bababooey55,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:35:00 2015 UTC,"Johnson was a such a wreck last season, I think they still might want to see more from him in AAA."
whitesox,3arm5x,froglegs_jackson,2,Tue Jun 23 01:36:45 2015 UTC,I just can't see him being any worse than Danks at this point. But I understand them wanting more seasoning for him in AAA.
whitesox,3arm5x,AnniesBoobzz,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:42:19 2015 UTC,Totally agree.
whitesox,3arm5x,froglegs_jackson,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:40:18 2015 UTC,Somebody's feelings may get hurt
whitesox,3arm5x,callmeroo,4,Tue Jun 23 01:41:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, clearly can't have that. I imagine that's why Robin is still employed."
whitesox,3arm5x,AnniesBoobzz,3,Tue Jun 23 01:59:30 2015 UTC,At least a national audience gets to watch Beckham's defense
whitesox,3arm5x,KJzero9,3,Tue Jun 23 01:52:46 2015 UTC,If you were sick of the announcers laughing on ESPN you can hear Hawk whimper on CSN.
whitesox,3arm5x,samlincoln,3,Tue Jun 23 02:08:11 2015 UTC,We should try and sign Carlos' cousin Pablo. I heard he's available.
whitesox,3arm5x,Kknowledge,3,Tue Jun 23 01:42:17 2015 UTC,"Well, I can't take anymore of this.  It was nice chatting with you all.  I'm going to be gone for a bit, but I'll see you guys/girls on Friday."

whitesox,3arm5x,waff1ez,3,Tue Jun 23 01:52:10 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised this isn't the worst team in the league. Bad starting pitching, bad defense, bad hitting, bad managing. Literally nothing outside of Chris Sale is good."
whitesox,3arm5x,NineduceXII,3,Tue Jun 23 02:07:35 2015 UTC,I swear this team is baseballs equivalent of the Washington generals
whitesox,3arm5x,waff1ez,3,Tue Jun 23 02:07:46 2015 UTC,I'm not going to another game until this useless sack of shit team gets a major overhaul. Dear fucking god we're going to end the season as the worst team in baseball.
whitesox,3arm5x,ADS94,3,Tue Jun 23 02:11:51 2015 UTC,At this point I think I'm going to turn score notifications off. This team doesn't even deserve my passive interest.
whitesox,3arm5x,SlagginOff,3,Tue Jun 23 02:15:37 2015 UTC,The run differential so far this season between the Twins and White Sox is +42 runs for the twins.
whitesox,3arm5x,Crixus_champion,2,Tue Jun 23 02:27:15 2015 UTC,Wowwwww. That's comical.
whitesox,3arm5x,bababooey55,6,Tue Jun 23 02:34:49 2015 UTC,I come in peace. Hey y'all
whitesox,3arm5x,y2jayjk,3,Tue Jun 23 02:44:50 2015 UTC,No one cares if you're here. We've all lost the will to fight/live.

whitesox,3arm5x,bababooey55,2,Tue Jun 23 02:09:42 2015 UTC,"Oh God. On a whim I decided to come (alone, actually), but I'm leaving early since I'm going skydiving bright and early tomorrow morning.   Hopefully this game won't make me wanna kill myself. That's all I want.   On another note, if you happen to be here, I'm in 122! Come say hi!"

whitesox,3arm5x,KJzero9,2,Tue Jun 23 00:18:39 2015 UTC,"Bases loaded. Good at-bat, Melkman."
whitesox,3arm5x,Georgie56,2,Tue Jun 23 00:22:40 2015 UTC,And we have the lead!
whitesox,3arm5x,Georgie56,2,Tue Jun 23 00:32:26 2015 UTC,That was a nice throw.
whitesox,3arm5x,vikingrunner,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:54:36 2015 UTC,Damn. Yeah it was

whitesox,3arm5x,Georgie56,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:59:15 2015 UTC,Shhh.  He hasn't noticed that he's actually playing like a real ball player yet. Don't let him know.
whitesox,3arm5x,KJzero9,2,Tue Jun 23 00:59:43 2015 UTC,"Is there a reason other than wanting more speed in the lineup why Beckham isn't the everyday 2nd baseman? I know he plays a lot anyway, but still."
whitesox,3arm5x,vikingrunner,2,Tue Jun 23 01:03:49 2015 UTC,Oh for God's sake.
whitesox,3arm5x,Georgie56,2,Tue Jun 23 01:06:19 2015 UTC,holy fuck
whitesox,3arm5x,ChiTownSox,2,Tue Jun 23 01:11:12 2015 UTC,Don't see that everyday. Looks like he's alright though.
whitesox,3arm5x,vikingrunner,2,Tue Jun 23 01:14:31 2015 UTC,HOW MUCH MORE PROOF DO WE NEED THAT JOHN DANKS IS THE WORST!?!?
whitesox,3arm5x,AnniesBoobzz,2,Tue Jun 23 01:18:13 2015 UTC,This team is bad and they should feel bad
whitesox,3arm5x,ADS94,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:21:48 2015 UTC,He was traded. I think.
whitesox,3arm5x,NineduceXII,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:28:54 2015 UTC,Correct we traded him for Jennings
whitesox,3arm5x,constapatedape,2,Tue Jun 23 01:29:45 2015 UTC,I'll bet we go 2-7 on this road trip. No better.

whitesox,3arm5x,socklessmoejohnson,2,Tue Jun 23 01:50:52 2015 UTC,Maybe I'll start watching the Charlotte Knights instead.
whitesox,3arm5x,bababooey55,2,Tue Jun 23 02:13:04 2015 UTC,There's not much talent there either.
whitesox,3arm5x,samurai5625,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:10:59 2015 UTC,Yeah but at least they don't suck
whitesox,3arm5x,bababooey55,2,Tue Jun 23 02:11:43 2015 UTC,"Just checked the score with a feeling of dread in the pit of my stomach, not quite sure what to expect.   Thank God I left."

whitesox,3arm5x,bababooey55,2,Tue Jun 23 02:44:03 2015 UTC,"Hey guys, Northside neighbor here.  I come in peace. I'm watching the game replay at work and I just have to know how you guys can enjoy Hawk as much as you do. I mean, I was able to listen in during my lunch break just now and all he did was shit on your team. I get being upset about a lack of performance (no offense intended), but Hawk is just plain mean about it. The other guy even tried to say something in defense of the team, but he just got shot down immediately. So can you guys tell me why it is you all love him so much?"
whitesox,3arm5x,gamenut89,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:23:02 2015 UTC,"Are you not familiar with Steve stone?  Lol the ""other guy"""
whitesox,3arm5x,demerdar,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:36:50 2015 UTC,I don't like Hawk as a rule but I have no problem with him telling it like it is about the Sox.
whitesox,3arm5x,mycrows,3,Tue Jun 23 02:57:39 2015 UTC,"While changing my son, he literally pissed on my Sox shirt I was wearing. Not 2 min later had a diaper blowout and shit on my shirt. I took that as a sign of how this team is."
whitesox,3arm5x,heavykevy1983,2,Tue Jun 23 03:39:27 2015 UTC,I knew we should have traded Alexei when we had the chance.
whitesox,3arm5x,Kknowledge,2,Tue Jun 23 19:28:07 2015 UTC,I thought the same thing. 32 years old and we could have got something decent in return. love him over the years but regression was bound to happen
whitesox,3arm5x,ChiTownSox,2,Tue Jun 23 20:44:41 2015 UTC,I've been watching the ESPN game. They keep laughing at how bad we are. I missed Hawk and Stone so bad I switched back to them. At least they don't openly mock our shitty team on a national stage
whitesox,3arm5x,ADS94,7,Wed Jun 24 01:13:29 2015 UTC,This team deserves to be mocked on a national level.

whitesox,3arm5x,Georgie56,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:22:11 2015 UTC,Can we capitalize on this? *Having LaRoche get back to back hits on a lefty seems unlikely.

whitesox,3arm5x,Georgie56,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:52:26 2015 UTC,Melky almost stopped on the basepath to see where the ball was. .. Bad base running

whitesox,3arm5x,Georgie56,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:59:22 2015 UTC,That wasn't even close.

whitesox,3arm5x,SlagginOff,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:27:35 2015 UTC,0-4 for Eaton. Rough to have a .238 hitter at the top of the order.
whitesox,3arm5x,samlincoln,2,Tue Jun 23 01:28:59 2015 UTC,"He's hit like .280 since May or something, so at least that's a little better."

whitesox,3arm5x,constapatedape,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:38:22 2015 UTC,Our cluster hitting rating must be bad though... I haven't really bothered to look it up. Surely we will eventually regress to the mean?
whitesox,3arm5x,chocoholicsoxfan,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:47:55 2015 UTC,Meanwhile nobody bats .300 and we have a started batting under .150

whitesox,3arm5x,NineduceXII,-1,Tue Jun 23 01:57:19 2015 UTC,Why does Soto throw the ball back to the pitcher like that?
whitesox,3arm5x,iOwnAnlPhone,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:08:03 2015 UTC,"His defense and batting are nothing to write home about, gotta do something to get people to take notice of him."

whitesox,3anhgs,whitesox20051,2,Mon Jun 22 03:48:50 2015 UTC,Have him be the starting catcher from now on. Pretty sure he can hit better than Flowers and he would lead the team in TWTW

whitesox,3amgao,america_rex,28,Sun Jun 21 17:46:29 2015 UTC,Fuck this inferiority complex. The Sox are never going to be the focus of this city. The whole point of being a Sox fan is to know that and not give a fuck.
whitesox,3amgao,New_Slurm,7,Sun Jun 21 19:36:47 2015 UTC,"Pretty much, if you can't handle that you may as well find another team to root for because that's not changing anytime soon. Unless the Sox build a team like the Hawks that are championship contenders with a lineup of likeable players."
whitesox,3amgao,samurai5625,2,Sun Jun 21 20:38:27 2015 UTC,My dad was saying the Sox really screwed up by not doing exactly that when the Cubs went full rebuild 3 ish years ago. Big missed opportunity to steal some fans.
whitesox,3amgao,IDCimSTRONGERtnUinRL,24,Mon Jun 22 17:15:45 2015 UTC,"To be fair, the Cubs game came one day after they won the Cup. At this point it's almost been a week. A lot of the players have already started going back to their respective homes, hard to coordinate anything at this point. If the Sox had been at home last Tuesday the whole team likely would have been there."
whitesox,3amgao,screamineagle411,0,Sun Jun 21 18:56:09 2015 UTC,I understand that but why has it taken so long for the cup to go to the cell?

whitesox,3amgao,ACSimeon,9,Sun Jun 21 18:39:20 2015 UTC,He was there Saturday too. Probably a legit a fan to go to back-to-back games when the team is playing this poorly. Maybe he's the good luck charm though and we'll see back to back wins today.
whitesox,3amgao,Vantagonist,5,Sun Jun 21 20:52:09 2015 UTC,"He stuck around for a good part of the game too, held up the cup from his suite a couple times to get the crowd going."

whitesox,3anqb5,TheRealPeteWheeler,5,Mon Jun 22 00:47:53 2015 UTC,"You could send over ever single player you mentioned and it honestly still wouldn't be close. Make an offer of Rizzo, Bryant, your top four/five minor league prospects, and all of your first round draft picks for the next several years and we'll talk. But Chris Sale is 26 years old and is among the top three best starting pitchers in the majors right now, if not the best. The only way we'd ever trade him away is if we absolutely fleeced somebody and stole so much young talent and so many draft picks that the other team wouldn't recover for decades."
whitesox,3anqb5,TheRealPeteWheeler,-1,Mon Jun 22 00:49:22 2015 UTC,What about Theo?
whitesox,3anqb5,waff1ez,4,Mon Jun 22 00:49:45 2015 UTC,"Like I said, it's not close. The only way we'd ever give up Sale is if somebody wanted to give us a ridiculously unbelievable haul that would cripple their team for the next 5-10 years. He's as close to untouchable as anybody in the league. And taking into consideration that you're our cross-town rivals? Nah, bro. You'd have a better chance of digging up Cy Young's body and using his DNA to make five identical clones. Not trying to be a dick, just being honest. If the White Sox trade Sale for anything less than a literal king's ransom, I'll buy a tent and start living off the grid, because the world will have gone mad."
whitesox,3anqb5,BernankesBeard,2,Mon Jun 22 00:56:55 2015 UTC,"I get it, just thought i'd try."
whitesox,3anqb5,BeerInTheBabySeat,2,Mon Jun 22 00:57:29 2015 UTC,"Eh, I think your OP is pretty decent.  You have to remember, the Sox have like three things going well.. Sale/Rodon/David Robertson (who is a closer for a ~100 loss team so.. yeah) Jose Abreu, and the fact that we might fire our Manager.  When you subtract our best player, we loose a lot to look forward to.  If we're in the same boat next year (with or without massive changes) I think our fanbase will be more open to trading him."

whitesox,3ajv02,i90east,4,Sun Jun 21 01:07:36 2015 UTC,"I finally agree. Fire Robin. The proof was in the 8 game skid. The team lost the first 3 games without him in Tampa Bay, and then he came back... and we still lost 5 straight games. It clearly makes no difference whether he's our manager or not. I just want him to be done managing to save him from any further embarrassment, because I loved him as a player."
whitesox,3ajv02,ACSimeon,3,Sun Jun 21 01:23:14 2015 UTC,"That's been my problem with Robin. Looking at coaches, they are normally defined as two types: a player's coach, normally a former player, who is more relaxed but is still respected, and a coach's coach, who is normally much stricter. The thing these two have in common is that they at least both coach. That is where Robin has created the third type of coach... the non-existent coach. Does Robin do anything but sit in the dugout with sunglasses on? Yes. He walks to the mound to take pitchers out of the game. That's all I've ever seen him do. #FireRobin"

He cut the reporter off and was pissed; that wasn't a stock answer, it was a response defending his guys and it was genuine.   Last week Sale lost 2-1 giving up 4 hits; he said the loss was HIS fault. That it was his job to shut the door.  If you think 97% of the league feels that way, you are just clueless as to how elite level athletes think.  He is a competitor, and a lot of competitors say things they regret. Peyton Manning threw his entire offensive line under the bus after losing a Superbowl; just to use him as one example.  I'm not arguing that a lot of players would throw their teammates under the bus, but the vast majority of them would not get snippy and defensive when asked a question such as Sale was asked.

whitesox,3aj1y3,chisoxbot,11,Sat Jun 20 17:55:00 2015 UTC,We have absolutely not been giving Alexei as much shit as he deserves this season.
whitesox,3aj1y3,chocoholicsoxfan,6,Sat Jun 20 18:38:47 2015 UTC,He is certainly making it hard to trade him.
whitesox,3aj1y3,Petey_Peppers,2,Sat Jun 20 18:50:57 2015 UTC,I have!  He is the opposite of clutch. His defense is lazy and I suspect he's somewhat afraid of the ball and base runners. Watch...next time he's up and a righty throws him a curve. He will dodge it like its coming for his head only to hit the zone for a strike.
whitesox,3aj1y3,PigFarmington,4,Sat Jun 20 18:42:46 2015 UTC,His defense isn't lazy. He used to be one of the best defensive SS in baseball. He's just lost a ton of range. That's what happens when you get old.

whitesox,3aj1y3,ACSimeon,2,Sat Jun 20 23:16:43 2015 UTC,"Alexei has played 156, 158, 158, 158, 158 games the last 5 years. That doesn't sound like someone that's going to suddenly become lazy to me."
whitesox,3aj1y3,froglegs_jackson,0,Sun Jun 21 00:51:57 2015 UTC,"He's showing up to the games, but is his heart in them right now? How can it be, they're not even close to .500 right now.  He'll get better when he finds his confidence again. He was a Silver Slugger at age 32, why can't he just be competent at age 33?  You say he's declining with age now, I say he's due for 3 or 4 more solid years at least. I know you might be right, but wouldn't you be happier if I was? Isn't it better for his trade value if I'm right? I'm going to miss that fucker if we do trade him out of here."

whitesox,3aim8p,DomCaboose,5,Sun Jun 21 01:41:40 2015 UTC,"At least then it would be Bud's fault instead of Robin's. I like Robin. That's why he needs to be fired. I don't know who downvoted you, but you're right."

Cheer for individual efforts in a losing season. Chris Sale is an early Cy Young candidate. D-Rob is usually a good show. Last night was the exception, not the rule with him. We're all pulling for Abreu to have another stellar campaign. Today, Rodon just cemented his place as a fan favorite by snapping this skid and rebounding from being shelled."

Since the 'stros move to the AL, the Nationals have taken over as my NL team to watch.   For individual players to watch, always Buehrle at the top of the list. Kris Bryant, Joey Gallo,  Gio Stanton and Jose Fernandez (can't wait to see what he's got when he's activated in July) have quickly climbed up into the ""must see"" category.   Our boys will always be #1 for me. I still feel there's too much talent on this team to stay in this god awful funk we're in. Overly optimistic? Maybe. This team reminds me of the Bears last season.

But I've been in Pittsburgh the last two years, and they sure make a darn good pitch in terms of fan culture, exciting young talent, and a gorgeous stadium. Can you in good conscience root for two division rivals? Like, I've lived in Detroit too and been glad to see the Tigers win, but there's never been a question that the White Sox came first. What do I do?"
whitesox,3ah4a7,ggslovin,19,Sat Jun 20 03:14:47 2015 UTC,I'm still salty that Kenny traded away Gio Gonzalez for Swisher

whitesox,3ah4a7,JROremus,8,Sat Jun 20 14:47:31 2015 UTC,"I love Reinsdorf, but his loyalty is frustrating at times. I'm sure Ventura will be gone after this year, but will probably get a promotion.  The whole player developmental side of the Sox is awful, as stated in the original post. Look at the Sox starting lineup and you have two players that we developed if we count Beckham as a starter. Both of them are offensively awful--Sanchez comically so. The White Sox need to have better scouts who actually can identify talent and better coaches who can actually develop said talent. The White Sox have no team philosophy. Their major league hitters swing at EVERYTHING. How many times this year do we see starting pitchers go deep into games with pitch counts nowhere near 100? This team takes no walks. This team sees very few pitches. We never wear out bullpens and as a result are constantly facing fresh pitchers while our guys get worn out over and over and over. This team has no direction.  I realize this post was poorly structured and full of rambling, but our minor league system has sucked so bad the last decade or so (thanks to KW) and we can develop all the pitchers we want, but if we can't develop young hitters we are always going to have to either seek out guys who have already played their best years (LaRoche [even though he's not the worst on the team], Dunn, Melky, etc.) or play terrible players because we have no alternative (Gillespie, Beckham, Flowers, Sanchez).  It's just a real depressing time to be a fan with no real light at the end of the tunnel. Literally the only silver lining is that we don't have any contracts that are for a long time. Here's to hoping Shark's compensation pick ends up being okay and that we can have a stellar rotation in a few years.   Sorry for the ramblings. Fuck this team."
whitesox,3ah4a7,crackberry313,2,Sat Jun 20 04:35:34 2015 UTC,"This post pretty much sums up my feeling right now with the team. I'm sure some of our developmental problems have something to do with the minor league coaches along with some bad scouts. I venture to think that they might not even be good at scouting pitchers since Rodon was a pretty easy pick at that spot and was already a well regarded prospect. Don Cooper has set a good precedent in the organization with pitching development but the hitting aspect needs a redo.   I really love how loyal of a guy Reinsdorf is, but sometimes he has to cut ties with people. Williams needs to go and we need to overhaul the minor league coaches."

whitesox,3ah4a7,ACSimeon,14,Sat Jun 20 11:43:39 2015 UTC,"I feel like the mods should have something on the sidebar for this: Buehrle was older than Danks. Danks was already better than him, at the time. Danks signed a contract which was very good for his age and performance.   THEN Danks got injured and his career went downhill.   Nobody could have predicted it.   His retaining was fine for the time."
whitesox,3ah4a7,ACSimeon,2,Sat Jun 20 13:47:05 2015 UTC,"It was never a smart idea to give Danks that kind of money in a contract that was so unfriendly to the team. He was good, not great. Kenny Williams overpaid even if Danks had stayed healthy. Buerhle is a franchise legend so you can get away with paying him for what he did instead of what he will do, but guess what? Buerhle is still killing it."
whitesox,3ah4a7,ACSimeon,5,Sat Jun 20 13:49:03 2015 UTC,"Hindsight is 20/20. And Danks' WAR in the years before he got injured was 6.4, 5.0, and 5.5. He was only 25 at the time and entering his prime years. The contract they gave him was how much a good pitcher received. Had he been a free agent, somebody would have overpaid for him and given him much, much more."

whitesox,3ah4a7,ricker182,0,Sat Jun 20 14:00:14 2015 UTC,"I don't think he would have gotten any better. I think he would have stagnated and regressed regardless of the shoulder injury. He just doesn't have ""it"" the way guys like Buerhle & Sale do. It's a weird sport, I'm convinced no one knows what they're talking about. Least of all me. Terry Francona said Michael Jordan could have been a solid baseball player if he had stuck with it for 2 more years."
whitesox,3ah4a7,todd330,3,Sat Jun 20 14:03:05 2015 UTC,"Kenny almost went to Toronto a few years ago.  I think Reinsdorf put a stop to that though.  Damn it, do they still want him?  Hahn should call and see if they do, they can have him for free, or bautista.  I'm fine with either."

How can a highly touted offence only average 1.2 runs a night over 2 series.  I literally was saddened the other night when I watched Adam and Alexei fumble that simple fly ball.

whitesox,3aj0xr,Kwy4792,9,Sat Jun 20 17:45:28 2015 UTC,It's a dumb piece for a lot of reasons; the main one being the White Sox are a 120 year old franchise and it took them 120 years to find someone this good. Trading him for prospects in hopes of one of the prospects being 1/2 as good as Sale is just absurd.  With his contract and age he's someone you build around; it's not like you have a limited window with him - he's 26 years old. You're searching for young talented players; trading your most talented one who is also young is just stupid.
whitesox,3aj0xr,WSOXFAN22,4,Sat Jun 20 17:54:53 2015 UTC,Idk why you're getting down voted. There is nothing wrong with your comment.
whitesox,3aj0xr,JBProds,7,Sat Jun 20 18:13:13 2015 UTC,Almost feels like the Sub has been taken over by non-White Sox fans.   What White Sox fan wants to trade Chris Sale? Enjoy what you're watching because it is historic. We stink right now - no doubt about that - but that doesn't mean you can't still appreciate greatness when it's right in front of your face.   Should the Angels trade Mike Trout if they struggle? I don't think people understand how difficult it is to find once in a generation players/talents.
whitesox,3aj0xr,WSOXFAN22,3,Sat Jun 20 18:21:45 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Of course, I'm still upset about last night. Not so much about the loss (because I""m used to it at this point), but for Chris Sale. We've spoiled so many brilliant games for him & he continues to pitch better than I've ever seen him pitch. No player acquired for him could change a game completely like Sale does for us.  Also, I literally just used that Trout example a couple days ago. Plus, Sale has a team friendly deal. I'm sure all the people that would want to trade him knew that..."
whitesox,3aj0xr,JBProds,3,Sat Jun 20 18:29:39 2015 UTC,"Watching Chris Sale’s season play out is excruciating, because he appears to be building one of the great performances of his time and the White Sox just keep on losing. He allowed two hits to Texas over eight innings Friday, striking out 14 – you can see it here -- yet the White Sox lost. Again.  The numbers speak for themselves. From the Elias Sports Bureau: Chris Sale is the third pitcher in modern baseball history (since 1900) with 12 or more strikeouts in five consecutive starts (Pedro Martinez in 1999, Randy Johnson in 1998).  Another one: Chris Sale is just the third pitcher in the last 10 seasons to strike out at least 14 while walking none in a game that he didn't win (2013 Yu Darvish: no decision; 2012 James Shields: lost).  There’s nobody else in baseball quite like Sale, with his elbowed and kneed delivery, with his mid-90s fastball. Not only is his stuff excellent, but hitters will also tell you that the difficulty in facing Sale is that there are no repetitions to draw on between the moments you’re in the box against him. There are no other lefties with his arm angle, his height and the funkiness in his delivery.  Sometimes, hitters will call friends on other teams and ask for tips about a particular starting pitcher and about the experience of batting against them, and like college friends studying a language, one hitter can educate the other based on some commonality in the interpretation, to make sense of the information.  But this can’t really happen with Sale, who is more like a Rosetta Stone – someone who has an interpretation all his own.  Really, he is the closest thing we’ve seen to Randy Johnson since the Big Unit retired.  Sale has 110 strikeouts and 20 walks in 88 2/3 innings, he turned 26 in March, and he is in the midst of what appears to be of the great team-friendly deals of all time.  Sale is making $6 million this year, and will earn $9.15 million next season, and $12 million in 2018. Additionally – and here’s the real topper – his deal contains a $12.5 million team option for 2019, and a $13.5 million option for 2020.  Sale’s mechanics have always scared evaluators, because he looks like an elbow injury waiting to happen, with the unusual angle and torque built into his delivery. But his contract inoculates his employer from risk, because his production so far outweighs his salary that even if he broke down, the team would benefit, given the parachutes provided by the team options.  You could make an argument that right now, Sale might be the most valuable asset with more than three years of service time; the Rays’ Chris Archer, who has a similarly structured deal, could be another candidate.  This is why the White Sox should at least explore the idea of trading Sale before the July 31 deadline.  They almost certainly wouldn’t find a deal to their liking, and even if the front office received a really interesting overture, White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf might dismiss it out of hand because of how fans might view the implication of the deal. This would be like the Seattle Mariners trading Felix Hernandez early in his career.  But at a time when the 31-year-old Cole Hamels appears to be a one-of-a-kind item in the trade market with high value because he’s a proven pitcher with an existing contract that has as many as four years remaining for about $100 million, can you imagine how much more value the 26-year-old Sale – guaranteed only about $25 million – might extract?  The White Sox could call franchises like the Dodgers, the Rangers, the Red Sox, the Yankees and essentially ask for a seven-course meal of prospects.  The value of Sale and his contract is so high that he might be impossible to deal, in the end, because of the difficulty in structuring a trade that would reflect what he’s worth.  But it’s a conversation worth having, just in case somebody comes forward with something so irresistible that the White Sox are tempted … before saying no, in all likelihood.  From ESPN Stats & Information, how Sale dominated the Rangers:  A. Continued dominance with slider: Opponents were 0-6 with 5 K's against Chris Sale's slider on Friday. Since May 12, opponents are 6-39 with 29 K's against the pitch. Twenty-nine of the last 33 outs Sale has recorded with his slider have been strikeouts. Sale in elite company  Struck out 10 batters in 6 straight starts - single season in modern era (since 1900) Pitcher Season(s) Chris Sale  2015 Randy Johnson   1998-2002 Pedro Martinez  1997, 1999 (2) Nolan Ryan  1977    Elias Sports Bureau    B. The whole arsenal was working: Sale had his entire repertoire working against the Rangers on Friday.  C. Kept the ball down: Sale threw 65 percent of his pitches in the lower half of the strike zone or lower on Friday. Opponents were 1-for-11 with 6 strikeouts in at-bats to end on a pitch in the lower half of the zone or lower. In his previous start, they were 1-12 with 6 strikeouts. Chris Sale by Pitch  Friday vs. Rangers Pitch   H-AB    K Fastball    1-10    5 Changeup    1-10    4 Slider  0-6 5  Another from Elias on Sale: Chris Sale has now struck out at least 10 batters in six straight starts. The only other players to accomplish that in the modern era are Randy Johnson, Pedro Martinez and Nolan Ryan.  One more Elias note on Sale, because all of these numbers really do speak for themselves: Including Chris Sale on Friday, there have now been 34 scoreless starts with 14 or more strikeouts and no walks in modern MLB history.  Sale is only the second one whose team lost, joining Randy Johnson in 2004.  Sale refuses to quit on the White Sox, writes Doug Padilla."

We addressed every area we were lacking.   And then every single part decided to have their worst career seasons at the same time. That doesn't happen. There has to be something else at hand. It starts with coaching/management. It's terrible. Something needs to change.   It's such a shame how much talent this team has and how awful they are.

Gillaspie, Flowers, Eaton, Alexei and even Abreu's performances were not indicative of their true level of play, but they still made Hahn think that it was a good time to pull the trigger in the offseason and try to make a run at things, and winds up getting players that are underperforming greatly. Or 2) everyone is having an impossibly poorly timed down year at the same time. Probably more likely that it's the former, but one can hope right?"
whitesox,3agtar,AnDEErew,1 point,Sat Jun 20 03:05:45 2015 UTC,Except the big name free agent guys we brought in all suck right now too. So It's definitely a little of column A & a little of column B. Fire Robin. :(

His 'athletic, toolsy' draft philosophy has been a complete bust. Right now I do not trust the current org to do a complete rebuild as they'd only fuck it up.  The ONLY games I'm going to watch are Chris Sale starts and the moment he's out of the game the game goes off. If I can I'm going to watch the opposing broadcast because although I like Stoney I'm sick to death of hawk and his dinosaur fucking commentary."
whitesox,3ah3kg,socklessmoejohnson,2,Sat Jun 20 04:09:07 2015 UTC,I agree. Looking at our draft this season makes me scratch my head. I like about 3-5 of our picks.

whitesox,3ah3kg,socklessmoejohnson,1 point,Sat Jun 20 04:12:49 2015 UTC,My crackpot theory is that he keeps drafting versions of himself when he was young (raw athletes) again and again in the vain hope that one of them will have huge MLB success and his baseball playing career will be somehow vindicated. I don't think he's doing it consciously but it's happening.  Edit: Whoever downvoted me I'm just going to imagine it's a tearful Kenny Williams

whitesox,3ahco3,socklessmoejohnson,2,Sat Jun 20 13:19:51 2015 UTC,"At this point, Micah's bat & speed would be an improvement over Sanchez's solid defense. We're dead last in the AL in scoring.

whitesox,3ahco3,JBProds,3,Sat Jun 20 18:25:29 2015 UTC,Dude got sent down because his awful defense was losing us games. One below-average (79 wRC+) bat + terrible defense is not the change that this team needs. It would probably be marginally better than Sanchez overall but at least in AAA he can practice 2B while being shielded from a torrent of losing.
whitesox,3ahco3,socklessmoejohnson,3,Sat Jun 20 18:28:44 2015 UTC,"Dude was hitting .270 & had a .333 OBP. How much of an impact has Sanchez's defense really made? Definitely not wins. You don't think Sanchez's pathetic .146 AVG & .204 OBP cost us games? I do understand what you're saying about not wanting him to experience excessive losses, but he's seen plenty of that over the year's in Kanny, W-S, Birmingham & Charlotte. Also, he had a lot of pressure on him being the starting 2B from Opening Day & playing when the team had extremely high expectations. Now the expectations are as low as ever. Won't have much pressure on him & will allow him to just play like he always has."
whitesox,3ahco3,JBProds,2,Sat Jun 20 18:39:22 2015 UTC,Both players provide negative value in the bigs. Sanchez is probably the more worthless but I have officially given up on this season and if staying in AAA is better for Micah's development then that's where I want him.

whitesox,3agh07,iDrinan,11,Sat Jun 20 02:45:33 2015 UTC,I'm so sorry. Sale doesn't deserve that shit.

whitesox,3agh07,RushLimbaughIsFat,2,Sat Jun 20 02:21:56 2015 UTC,We should trade 15 of our guys on this roster for a second-round draft pick.

whitesox,3agh07,The-Assman,10,Sat Jun 20 02:39:07 2015 UTC,I think even yellow M&M jacket guy has stopped going to the games. Edit: HE IS BACK!
whitesox,3agh07,ThaBomb,5,Sat Jun 20 00:15:08 2015 UTC,"This sentence is the definition of rock bottom. Might even be a sign of the apocalypse   Edit: he's there, Sale is dominating, offense is almost nonexistent. Things are back to normal"
whitesox,3agh07,sevelev711,8,Sat Jun 20 00:31:18 2015 UTC,Fun Fact: Chris Sale has struck out everybody.
whitesox,3agh07,froglegs_jackson,11,Sat Jun 20 01:58:14 2015 UTC,"I know Sale was dealing, but there's no point in paying for an elite closer if you don't use him in situations like this."
whitesox,3agh07,Spaaace_Ghooost,2,Sat Jun 20 02:19:00 2015 UTC,I don't think you can completely blame Robertson either.He is really good but it is hard to get in a groove sometimes when you don't pitch for a week. He also had only 1 run of protection which just increases the chance of a blown save.
whitesox,3agh07,TheCity95,8,Sat Jun 20 06:20:36 2015 UTC,DAMN YOU RANGER FANS
whitesox,3agh07,iDrinan,8,Sat Jun 20 01:28:57 2015 UTC,I was cheering him on.
whitesox,3agh07,samlincoln,7,Sat Jun 20 01:29:52 2015 UTC,At least we can see him chase the Cy Young every 5 days. May be the only reason to watch later this summer.
whitesox,3agh07,ACSimeon,7,Sat Jun 20 01:57:59 2015 UTC,I like the clubs promotions and food too. Nacho Helmets are fucking crazy.
whitesox,3agh07,ricker182,4,Sat Jun 20 02:01:03 2015 UTC,The games are almost always fun regardless of that clownball on the field.
whitesox,3agh07,froglegs_jackson,8,Sat Jun 20 02:07:06 2015 UTC,"Sale deserves so much better, man."
whitesox,3agh07,thom_weights,8,Sat Jun 20 02:20:41 2015 UTC,"I'm following the game on my phone, are fans booing? I'd boo so fucking hard if I was there right now."
whitesox,3agh07,ricker182,5,Sat Jun 20 02:38:09 2015 UTC,Yes. Well deserved too.
whitesox,3agh07,LimitedRuse,2,Sat Jun 20 02:38:36 2015 UTC,"They're not booing hard enough, I'd stay as long as possible to boo if I was there."
whitesox,3agh07,bababooey55,9,Sat Jun 20 02:39:00 2015 UTC,Sale doing Sale things. Lineup doing White Sox things.
whitesox,3agh07,sevelev711,5,Sat Jun 20 00:48:11 2015 UTC,"You know, it's impressive that with this team you can be talking about a perfect game in the 6th and be talking about how the closer blew it in the 9th."
whitesox,3agh07,Georgie56,8,Sat Jun 20 02:22:25 2015 UTC,I won't blame Chris if he asks to be traded. This team is awful.
whitesox,3agh07,froglegs_jackson,5,Sat Jun 20 02:23:25 2015 UTC,"to those of you that care about this sort of thing, Sale had a negative FIP tonight. he broke the stat."
whitesox,3agh07,warhawkguy,8,Sat Jun 20 02:25:09 2015 UTC,"I have always been on the side of positivity.   But there better be some DAMN CHANGES. You cannot have a performance like Sale's go unfulfilled. A great chance to end the streak, and nothing.....holy fuck I am heated now."
whitesox,3agh07,froglegs_jackson,8,Sat Jun 20 02:40:20 2015 UTC,4 PLAYOFF APPEARANCES IN 34 YEARS. The only reason they made the playoffs in '08 is because they were in a trash division and won the 1 game playoff. It's an absolute disgrace.
whitesox,3agh07,sevelev711,5,Sat Jun 20 02:41:24 2015 UTC,I just want Chris to keep striking out 10 per game.
whitesox,3agh07,ACSimeon,2,Sat Jun 20 00:52:26 2015 UTC,Done.
whitesox,3agh07,Kknowledge,6,Sat Jun 20 01:59:43 2015 UTC,Sale is gunna have a perfect game in the 9th with a 0-0 tie

whitesox,3agh07,iDrinan,7,Sat Jun 20 01:46:22 2015 UTC,Sale pls.
whitesox,3agh07,Georgie56,5,Sat Jun 20 01:58:10 2015 UTC,"After that blowout in Arlington, consider this payback."
whitesox,3agh07,Patron_St_of_Liars,6,Sat Jun 20 01:58:50 2015 UTC,"just tuning in, guys! sale straight dealing, Colby looking like the bionic wonder that he is. Classic pitchers duel in y'all's park! how's everyone been since the last time we chatted?"
whitesox,3agh07,ricker182,6,Sat Jun 20 02:02:02 2015 UTC,"Although Colby is pitching really well, be careful with your optimism.    We typically can't hit shit anyway. Our offense is totally anemic."
whitesox,3agh07,samlincoln,3,Sat Jun 20 02:03:15 2015 UTC,Doing well. Your team has climbed the standings a bit since we last played.
whitesox,3agh07,ricker182,6,Sat Jun 20 02:03:54 2015 UTC,And we've tanked. It's no fun. But Sale is a delight.
whitesox,3agh07,ricker182,6,Sat Jun 20 02:05:47 2015 UTC,This Team Sucks
whitesox,3agh07,stoneyhawk,5,Sat Jun 20 02:20:55 2015 UTC,"Un fucking believable. Fuck this team. Poor Chris, man."
whitesox,3agh07,jnez50,6,Sat Jun 20 02:20:55 2015 UTC,How I feel about this.
whitesox,3agh07,bababooey55,5,Sat Jun 20 02:22:31 2015 UTC,"Alexei, Flowers, and Sanchez coming up... might as well turn the game off."
whitesox,3agh07,froglegs_jackson,2,Sat Jun 20 02:24:51 2015 UTC,so gross.
whitesox,3agh07,Georgie56,2,Sat Jun 20 02:25:39 2015 UTC,Tyler has been the only one creating offense.
whitesox,3agh07,bababooey55,3,Sat Jun 20 02:25:42 2015 UTC,He still sucks.
whitesox,3agh07,RushLimbaughIsFat,3,Sat Jun 20 02:26:18 2015 UTC,That pitch that he hit a homerun off of was basically a homerun derby pitch.

whitesox,3agh07,ricker182,3,Sat Jun 20 01:29:12 2015 UTC,I'm gonna laugh if the Sox don't win.    Sale is a monster. One of the few reasons I still watch.
whitesox,3agh07,bababooey55,4,Sat Jun 20 01:33:22 2015 UTC,So basically we need our starters to throw shutouts for us to have a chance to win. Gotcha.  If I were Chris I would be one bitter motherfucker.
whitesox,3agh07,ACSimeon,3,Sat Jun 20 01:40:28 2015 UTC,He won't be. He'll get paid. If they don't pay him they're fucking retarded.

whitesox,3agh07,ACSimeon,3,Sat Jun 20 01:58:46 2015 UTC,We need to find a way to take this game back in the bottom of the 9th. For Chris. This game basically just crushed all of my remaining hope.

whitesox,3agh07,RushLimbaughIsFat,5,Sat Jun 20 02:22:35 2015 UTC,I say we trade Alexei Ramirez for a box of cheerios and some extra baseballs for batting practice.
whitesox,3agh07,samlincoln,5,Sat Jun 20 02:26:50 2015 UTC,He looked great for the win-now team we were supposed to be. The only other shortstop that's good in our system is still at least a year away.

Not wasting any more time or money on this team. I'm not going to support this failure that management and ownership seem to be content with anymore. I'm done.

whitesox,3aitxx,WS05,10,Sat Jun 20 16:41:54 2015 UTC,This is the worst post in the history of this sub.  So you want to trade Sale for prospects hoping that one might turn out to be 1/2 as good as him? My lord.  Sale is 26 years old and has prime years left under contract and you want to trade him hoping to find good players in return when the organization has been around 120 years and Sale is the best pitcher we've ever found.
whitesox,3aitxx,WSOXFAN22,1 point,Sat Jun 20 17:23:43 2015 UTC,"I was with you up until that last part.   Ted Lyons? Ed Walsh? Early Wynn? Sale is great, but he's not the best pitcher in our history. Not yet."
whitesox,3aitxx,TheRealPeteWheeler,2,Sat Jun 20 21:00:45 2015 UTC,"I'd argue he certainly is.    None of those three guys dominated like Sale.  Ted Lyons struck out 1000 guys in 4000 innings. Had an ERA+ of 118.  Walsh struck out 1700 in 3000 innings and had an ERA+ of 145 - but also pitched in 1900 so you're really reaching here.   Wynn was practically league average throughout his career - he has a 107 ERA+.  I'd probably take Pierce over all three guys, although Walsh's numbers are slightly more impressive.   Chris Sale is accomplishing things that either no one, or only 2 other guys, have accomplished in the history of major league baseball. Longevity decides the success of a career; it does not dictate the greatness of ones peak. Sale is the most talented, and the best, pitcher to ever put on a White Sox uniform. That doesn't mean he's the most accomplished, but he's the best."
whitesox,3aitxx,WSOXFAN22,3,Sat Jun 20 21:16:40 2015 UTC,"The team isn't that far from contending. A change of coaches and a few moves, this team could (COULD) contend. No use in trading away your best player for prospects just yet."
whitesox,3aitxx,waff1ez,2,Sat Jun 20 17:32:44 2015 UTC,"This team sucks. There's no question, but you do not trade someone as great as Chris Sale. No team has enough prospects to fix this team. The White Sox do have a talented team on paper. It's not like everyone isn't going to play up to what is expected of them. A pitcher like Sale doesn't come along very often, if ever."
whitesox,3aitxx,JBProds,-1,Sat Jun 20 18:23:09 2015 UTC,"As much as it would suck to trade him, get a new FO first, then trade Sale.  Do you really want the people in charge now, trading one of the best pitchers in the league and getting back what they feel is good?"

whitesox,3ah1gc,Dudeist-Priest,2,Sat Jun 20 03:30:36 2015 UTC,"Just keep him and let him ride out an overdue management overhaul. We'll put a new team around him before he leaves his prime. Randy Johnson didn't win a World Series until 2001, and he debuted in 1988. Chris Sale debuted in 2010."
whitesox,3ah1gc,ACSimeon,3,Sat Jun 20 13:03:01 2015 UTC,So I'm just going to assume you're actually a troll from r/cubs.  Please don't take offense. I'm hoping the whiskey I'm drinking will blackout the memory of this game.   Update: It didn't. weeps
whitesox,3ah1gc,BernankesBeard,4,Sat Jun 20 03:41:17 2015 UTC,"No I'm a Sox fan, I just think you legitimately need to get a hall for Sale, legitimately clean out a good farm system like the cubs or astros. It's just to get fair value you need the right combo of a competitive major league team and a good farm system, and there's not many teams that fit that.  Also schwarbers swing is beautiful."
whitesox,3ah1gc,BernankesBeard,2,Sat Jun 20 04:09:48 2015 UTC,I know. I'm just going to cry if they trade Sale
whitesox,3ah1gc,AnDEErew,4,Sat Jun 20 04:11:47 2015 UTC,"I get the sentiment, but that would be so damn depressing. No thanks"
whitesox,3ah1gc,samlincoln,2,Sat Jun 20 03:27:16 2015 UTC,"We need Sale to keep us entertained in August when he's vying for a Cy Young. Without him, and with how mildly disappointing Abreu has been (depending on your expectations), we have nobody worth watching on this team and we need that."
whitesox,3ah1gc,chocoholicsoxfan,2,Sat Jun 20 04:35:22 2015 UTC,"This is a terrible idea.   Wanna know why? Because the White Sox are incapable of developing good non pitching prospects. No matter who we trade for, our development coaching will screw it up.   I firmly believe Gordon Beckham could've been an All-Star somewhere else."
whitesox,3ah1gc,chocoholicsoxfan,2,Sat Jun 20 04:56:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah on that point wouldn't it make sense to trade sale for young near pro level hitting prospects and trust Coop to develop a staff. We actually have some starting pitching prospects that are promising.  Without Sale you could still build a rotation out of Rodon, Quintana, along with guys like Fulmer (nasty stuff), danish, montas, and whatever else you bring in for Sale. Then add like four young impact bats to the lineup and you have a competive team."
whitesox,3ah1gc,asroka,2,Sat Jun 20 05:02:59 2015 UTC,"No because all of them still need to develop. Take Soler or Gallo for example (and Sale could not fetch four guys as good as these two are projected to be). They are starting off well, but they still need a lot of development to keep on the right track.  We don't have any coaches capable of keeping them on this track.   What we really need is a complete organizational coaching/staff overhaul. Trainers, hitting coaches, front office members, basically everyone."
whitesox,3ah1gc,todd330,2,Sat Jun 20 05:10:06 2015 UTC,He's 26-years old with the most team-friendly contract in baseball. This would be a franchise-worst decision of all-time.
whitesox,3ah1gc,SultanofStella,2,Sat Jun 20 09:14:11 2015 UTC,"As much as it would suck, I agree with you.  Trade Sale and get as many prospects as possible.  But before that happens, get rid of everybody in the front office.  You really want Kenny Williams or Hahn trading Sale for who they think will be good down the line?  I sure as hell don't.  Having Sale on the team now does nothing but keep the sox in games they will prob lose if he doesn't go complete."
whitesox,3ah1gc,JROremus,1 point,Sat Jun 20 03:31:15 2015 UTC,Think of the best possible return you could get for Sale and it would still not be worth it.
whitesox,3ah1gc,frakking-anustart,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:38:54 2015 UTC,"I don't know if a trade is possible. The White Sox would have to get no ""maybe"" players, so you have to find a team that is willing to give up multiple young for sure future All-Stars. He's a young pitcher who has absolutely filthy stuff and is one of the best 2 or 3 pitchers in all of baseball on a ridiculously team friendly contract.   If King Felix can stay in Seattle than Sale can stay right here. No thank you. Trading him would cripple the fan base. Absolutely terrible idea."

whitesox,3ah1gc,cardsfan1343,5,Sat Jun 20 02:45:49 2015 UTC,I don't even think I'd trade Sale for a complete team in MLB.    Maybe the Cardinals. But that's it.
whitesox,3ah1gc,ricker182,3,Sat Jun 20 02:53:41 2015 UTC,"I've got to be reading this wrong. You're not saying you wouldn't trade Sale for an entire MLB team, are you?"
whitesox,3ah1gc,cardsfan1343,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:55:39 2015 UTC,"I said maybe the Cardinals, but there isn't one dominant team I see that I'd trade Sale for.    I'm not big into trading for unknown prospect since that's rarely worked out for us.    We're just too incompetent at the top."

whitesox,3adcgp,chocoholicsoxfan,5,Fri Jun 19 17:21:32 2015 UTC,"At this point I'm wondering if there is tension or something in the clubhouse, or if something happened, like someone dying or something.   I mean, the way that Adam and (was it?) Alexei let that pop fly fall yesterday was absolutely unacceptable. It's not that hard to learn basic communication- my volleyball team learned the importance of yelling ""mine"" when we were 12. Well oiled teams just don't do stuff like that.  I know the Blackhawks were pretty heavily affected by the death of their equipment manager earlier this year. Wondering if something similar has happened or if there's some other sort of issue going on."
whitesox,3adcgp,PigFarmington,3,Fri Jun 19 18:48:46 2015 UTC,"Listening to the post game on the radio last night, a caller made a great point about Eaton's lack of outfield leadership and management when balls are hit and calling them or yelling instructive help and backing up the infield."
whitesox,3adcgp,weasol12,3,Fri Jun 19 13:54:25 2015 UTC,You've gotta go back to the 70's to find a White Sox team this horrendous. They were bleak times and brought us these.
whitesox,3adcgp,ACSimeon,4,Fri Jun 19 15:40:32 2015 UTC,It's incredible to think that 7 games ago we had just swept the best team in the American League out of our building.
whitesox,3adcgp,irish711,3,Fri Jun 19 16:10:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah at first I thought the losing streak was a fluke, but then I looked at the stats and realized that sweep was a fluke"
whitesox,3adcgp,JBProds,3,Fri Jun 19 15:41:20 2015 UTC,"This'll be the Summer of Hell. The Sox are a hot mess, and the Fire are all over the table."
whitesox,3adcgp,todd330,2,Fri Jun 19 17:19:55 2015 UTC,The front office continues to make useless picks after rounds 1 & 2. Drafted a slow throwing left-handed starter Zack Erwin in the 4th round. They allowed the Tigers to select a good offensive catcher Kade Scivique 18 picks later in the same round. Everyone knows how bad they need a bat behind the plate & how full they are with left handed starters. This whole draft class after Fulmer was a disappointment. No power hitters except one power bat form high school. Low batting averages & the pitchers had 3.50-4.3 ERAs which is pretty bad for college.
whitesox,3adcgp,constapatedape,2,Fri Jun 19 17:24:21 2015 UTC,"Don't forget drafting reinsdorfs grandson.  Granted it was a late pick, but still."
whitesox,3adcgp,JBProds,2,Fri Jun 19 15:47:04 2015 UTC,"I really did not like what Hahn did after our first pick this season, everything screamed of saving cash after the first pick"
whitesox,3adcgp,constapatedape,2,Fri Jun 19 18:02:08 2015 UTC,"That's exactly what I'm saying. None of them look like future MLB players. I know it's early, but pitchers that throw 87-91 mph will get hit and hitters that are barely hitting .270 with metal bats is not a good combo either. The lack of hitters is what stood out most. Is Beckham the only White Sox draft pick position player to make an impact over the past 10 years? And Beckham isn't even a starter."
whitesox,3adcgp,thom_weights,2,Fri Jun 19 18:50:31 2015 UTC,"Hopeful that Erwin can be a bullpen type eventually. But I mean we need position players badly, we've drafted a ton of pitching early and to pass on a good college catcher on a good college team in the 4th is really bad. Everything about the 2015 draft screams saving cash after the first round."

I initially didn't even want to go but she eventually convinced me because, heck, it was a free ball game. Man I am glad I didn't miss it. I can't imagine how much I'd hate myself if she'd let me stay home and sleep."

Anyway, he struck out one time with the bases loaded, and the camera followed him back to the dugout. He just looked so dejected and disappointed with himself, and after a while, you saw him mouth ""why do I always mess up?"" That sort of passion and love for the game still made me want to watch him, even though he wasn't playing that well.  It's that element, I think, which makes this team seem particularly bad."
whitesox,3acbw4,chocoholicsoxfan,8,Fri Jun 19 00:29:07 2015 UTC,I am feeling the EXACT same way. I absolutely love baseball but this team is making me despise it. It's a time consuming hobby and when your team is pure shit and nobody seems to care then you just get frustrated with the game in general.  I'm thinking watching some other teams might not be a bad idea like you mentioned.
whitesox,3acbw4,bababooey55,5,Fri Jun 19 00:23:08 2015 UTC,I've been watching a lot of NL baseball recently as I'm a bit out of touch with some of the teams. It's actually kind of a weight off my shoulders just letting myself enjoy a game instead of screaming internally.
whitesox,3acbw4,gotpez,8,Fri Jun 19 00:40:16 2015 UTC,"We make every pitcher look like a god. I'm convinced its mental. These players aren't scrubs, they're just hitting like scrubs. Approach is off, attitude is off or something. The mental side of the game comes from coaching. Fucking fire Ventura"
whitesox,3acbw4,todd330,2,Fri Jun 19 02:33:29 2015 UTC,That's what I was thinking.  Every pitcher they face seems to be cy young.  It sucks since there are pretty much 8 automatic outs on a daily basis.  I feel like they won't win another game this year seeing as they get 3-4 hits a game.
whitesox,3acbw4,ADS94,7,Fri Jun 19 04:15:17 2015 UTC,"We may suck, but the Sox are my team through and through.

whitesox,3acbw4,samlincoln,3,Fri Jun 19 00:51:17 2015 UTC,Pirates are a fine young team to watch. Ive been looking forward to watching them clash the south siders in this series all year. See how the boys stack up. I'm hoping for a big game in front of a packed house with the cup in the building and the shark on the mound! I love baseball! Always a story.
whitesox,3acbw4,ricker182,3,Thu Jun 18 23:30:51 2015 UTC,"I'll suffer through it, hoping it feels better if we do improve. I do want to see the Pirates play someone else though. They look good."
whitesox,3acbw4,lostmessage256,3,Fri Jun 19 00:49:58 2015 UTC,"For me it's partly a time zone thing as well. It's getting harder and harder to justify staying up till 3/4am to watch the Sox if they're playing this badly.  Edit: Love the Pirates, fun team to watch now that McCutcheon is heating up."
whitesox,3acbw4,RBI_Guy,3,Fri Jun 19 00:54:58 2015 UTC,I'm in the same boat. I absolutely love baseball. The Sox won't ruin that for me.
whitesox,3acbw4,Kumdogmillionaire,3,Fri Jun 19 00:56:28 2015 UTC,"True. I bought tickets for games back when I thought the team was going to be great, now I'm dreading going. I'm glad I get to see sale pitch tomorrow and abreu is always fun but the rest of the team is just physically draining to watch. I'd just rather not.   Just the other day someone offered me sox cubs tickets and I said no. I never thought I'd turn those down. I'll keep following the team just because statistically I'm sure this many players can't post career lows in one line up in the same year. As far as going to games, it's now just a chore and I'm not going to any more than I already paid for."

Difference is I don't see this team getting blown up at the trade deadline.  This org needs blown up, top to bottom."

whitesox,3acc3g,bababooey55,3,Fri Jun 19 02:09:56 2015 UTC,"Move over Dan Jennings, the new bullpen pitcher that I was high on that's falling apart is Duke. Failed with the lefty-lefty matchup. damn."
whitesox,3acc3g,samlincoln,3,Fri Jun 19 02:10:04 2015 UTC,"I blame overuse, Ventura uses him for everything, meanwhile our best bullpen arm never gets used. Think outside the box for one fucking second of your life Robin."
whitesox,3acc3g,socklessmoejohnson,3,Fri Jun 19 02:22:48 2015 UTC,"I blame overuse, Ventura uses him for everything.   Just kidding just kidding. I had to. I'm pretty pissed with him tonight myself. As a setup man and former starter he should be used to a lot of work."
whitesox,3acc3g,samlincoln,3,Fri Jun 19 02:22:59 2015 UTC,Well that's most likely game right there.
whitesox,3acc3g,NineduceXII,3,Fri Jun 19 02:23:14 2015 UTC,Hawk and Stoney sound like they're in different rooms. No chemistry at all.
whitesox,3acc3g,socklessmoejohnson,3,Fri Jun 19 02:36:25 2015 UTC,Was gonna get tickets to a game at Target Field next week.   Now I'm too ashamed.
whitesox,3acc3g,chocoholicsoxfan,6,Fri Jun 19 02:40:32 2015 UTC,Bag on head.
whitesox,3acc3g,samlincoln,5,Fri Jun 19 02:43:13 2015 UTC,I'm going to a game at Comerica next week with a bunch of Tigers fans. Now that's going to be embarrassing.
whitesox,3acc3g,bababooey55,3,Fri Jun 19 02:36:58 2015 UTC,"Wednesday night, the game is gonna be $5. Should I do it?"
whitesox,3acc3g,chocoholicsoxfan,5,Fri Jun 19 02:39:43 2015 UTC,$5 for a ballgame ain't too shabby at all. I would.  Edit - Sale is the expected starter. So that's an obvious yes.

whitesox,3acc3g,bababooey55,3,Fri Jun 19 02:49:49 2015 UTC,THAT BALL HIT DEEP!!!...  to an Abreu pop fly that didn't go near the warning track.
whitesox,3acc3g,socklessmoejohnson,2,Fri Jun 19 02:51:22 2015 UTC,He was just really PO'd that ball stayed in.
whitesox,3acc3g,chocoholicsoxfan,3,Fri Jun 19 02:57:30 2015 UTC,Ouch Hawk...giving Josh Phegleys superior numbers. And Semien's defense is the worst in the league at his position and Micah had a higher batting average and was sent down. Watch Viciedo do some decent shit with the A's.
whitesox,3acc3g,samlincoln,4,Fri Jun 19 02:48:08 2015 UTC,Booooooooooo.    Boooooooooooooooooooooooooooo.     BOO

whitesox,3acc3g,ADS94,2,Fri Jun 19 00:34:41 2015 UTC,What would be funny is if Shark dominates today and we can't score any runs.
whitesox,3acc3g,NineduceXII,3,Fri Jun 19 00:36:11 2015 UTC,Just like how hilarious it is when we get a QS out of Danks and still lose. I can see it happening

whitesox,3acc3g,AnniesBoobzz,2,Fri Jun 19 00:38:11 2015 UTC,Probably a good move to sit Garcia out for a bit. I looked at his average and had to do a double take.

I hate arrogant assholes like you that say there are no real fans of the Hawks because everyone jumped on 7 years ago.

Sending him down is a fine idea, but the fact remains that Hahn didn't give him all that ridiculous money. Also, starting pitching is the least of this team's problems.  Melky has been disappointing, no question, but I don't know a Sox fan that wasn't thrilled that we signed him. LaRoche, on the other hand, has been exactly what we paid for. He leads the team in walks and has an almost identical OPS as Avi.  If anything, blame Robin for keeping Melky in the two-hole until a week ago and batting LaRoche between Abreu and Garcia because he believes that alternating handedness up and down the lineup is mandatory. Among countless other outdated baseball beliefs.  If you want to fire Hahn for not firing Robin, I'm on board, but not for any of the reasons you listed."

whitesox,3a80r8,ricker182,2,Thu Jun 18 01:18:35 2015 UTC,"You give us your record, we'll throw in the dog, and some pizza. I'd even deliver it if I could get past construction"
whitesox,3a80r8,ADS94,4,Thu Jun 18 01:21:00 2015 UTC,The whitesox have lost the last 5 games that I have gone to. I really hope that ends tonight.
whitesox,3a80r8,aviddemon,-2,Wed Jun 17 23:36:30 2015 UTC,Have a great time watching the south sides finest. I got a good feeling about tonight. Quality ball on display. Should be a good one. God bless.   -Petey Peppers

whitesox,3a80r8,thom_weights,5,Thu Jun 18 00:24:44 2015 UTC,Danks has absolutely no chance against McCutchen.
whitesox,3a80r8,froglegs_jackson,10,Thu Jun 18 00:17:43 2015 UTC,Danks has absolutely no chance against McCutchen.   FTFY
whitesox,3a80r8,crustyruffles,9,Thu Jun 18 00:24:12 2015 UTC,"Or any professional hitter, really. He is so bad."
whitesox,3a80r8,froglegs_jackson,4,Thu Jun 18 00:18:02 2015 UTC,We had more wins on this day in 2013.   BRB crying
whitesox,3a80r8,chocoholicsoxfan,6,Thu Jun 18 01:34:28 2015 UTC,Good loss guys! We'll get 'em one of these days!
whitesox,3a80r8,bababooey55,4,Thu Jun 18 02:39:53 2015 UTC,None of these players give a shit anymore.
whitesox,3a80r8,magooster,5,Thu Jun 18 00:38:05 2015 UTC,Absolutely why trades need to happen.
whitesox,3a80r8,NineduceXII,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:39:59 2015 UTC,"The problem is they have very few pieces contenders would actually be interested in. I doubt they would trade a core player like Sale, Abreu, Quintana, etc"
whitesox,3a80r8,froglegs_jackson,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:43:24 2015 UTC,Those three guys you just mentioned won't be traded. They're too valuable to this club. Everyone else can hit the road. Maybe they'll do better on other teams.
whitesox,3a80r8,Georgie56,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:47:07 2015 UTC,"I'd try and trade: LaRoche, Alexei, Soto, Flowers, Danks, Shark, Gillaspie, Beckham, Noesi, maybe even Melkey."
whitesox,3a80r8,NineduceXII,2,Thu Jun 18 00:49:03 2015 UTC,"You aren't getting anything for Soto, Flowers, Danks, Gillaspie, Beckham, or Noesi. Those guys are waiver wire fodder. LaRoche might have value if they eat some money, who knows with Alexei. He's quietly been awful the last year or so."
whitesox,3a80r8,froglegs_jackson,0,Thu Jun 18 00:50:26 2015 UTC,Also I forgot Boneheadfacio. But there's always teams willing to take players like the ones I've listed. As long as the sox get rid of at least half of the listed I'll be happy.
whitesox,3a80r8,NineduceXII,4,Thu Jun 18 00:56:43 2015 UTC,Can't believe the sox didn't pull the trigger on the Francisco Cervelli trade last year. We could've had a competent 29 year old Catcher. All the Pirates gave up was an average pitcher.
whitesox,3a80r8,NineduceXII,2,Thu Jun 18 01:05:28 2015 UTC,"With our luck, he would be batting .190 for us."
whitesox,3a80r8,aviddemon,3,Thu Jun 18 01:15:05 2015 UTC,"I've never hated a team more than this one. This is the worst team I can remember. Not going by record, just how we fucking play."
whitesox,3a80r8,ricker182,4,Thu Jun 18 01:09:20 2015 UTC,OUR 30TH INNING IN A ROW WITH NO RUNS SCORED. HURRAY
whitesox,3a80r8,chocoholicsoxfan,5,Thu Jun 18 01:29:08 2015 UTC,WE'RE ALL GETTING LAID!!!!
whitesox,3a80r8,thom_weights,3,Thu Jun 18 01:29:41 2015 UTC,ONLY AROUND 12 MORE TO GO!  WE CAN DO IT TEAM!
whitesox,3a80r8,ADS94,4,Thu Jun 18 01:29:44 2015 UTC,😀🔫
whitesox,3a80r8,thom_weights,3,Thu Jun 18 02:39:56 2015 UTC,"Part of me wants us to get no-hit tonight, just to finally make management say enough is enough."
whitesox,3a80r8,thom_weights,3,Thu Jun 18 00:57:26 2015 UTC,....the other part of me wants motherfucking HALF OFF PJ's
whitesox,3a80r8,thom_weights,3,Thu Jun 18 01:00:01 2015 UTC,Fuck it let's just set the scoreless innings record. This is such a shitshow.
whitesox,3a80r8,bababooey55,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:58:36 2015 UTC,"Why not double it, then we will truly be immortalised in the history books"
whitesox,3a80r8,ADS94,3,Thu Jun 18 01:01:52 2015 UTC,Baseball is the only sport left I care about. And I'm starting not to care anymore. This team is depressing to watch.
whitesox,3a80r8,NineduceXII,2,Thu Jun 18 01:00:22 2015 UTC,I tuned out last week. I'm done watching. I'll check the standings here every once in awhile and I'll chat with you guys because you're cool.
whitesox,3a80r8,ricker182,3,Thu Jun 18 01:11:03 2015 UTC,What is the scoreless innings record?
whitesox,3a80r8,ricker182,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:10:07 2015 UTC,I think it's 42
whitesox,3a80r8,ADS94,3,Thu Jun 18 01:11:57 2015 UTC,We can do it!
whitesox,3a80r8,ricker182,3,Thu Jun 18 01:12:57 2015 UTC,"I've really really tried to exercise my patience this season, but I'm beginning to go crazy. I always think that it's still early, but with the other central teams playing well that time is running out each game that goes by. We're in June & 7 games under .500. I guess we can assume Shark will be dealt."
whitesox,3a80r8,JBProds,2,Thu Jun 18 01:16:16 2015 UTC,Yea the realization is creeping over me. Our margin for error now with this losing streak is getting thinner.
whitesox,3a80r8,samlincoln,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:20:20 2015 UTC,"I actually thought they turned the corner with the sweep, but it turns out I was very very wrong. I don't see MLB caliber at-bats from anyone besides Abreu right now."
whitesox,3a80r8,JBProds,3,Thu Jun 18 01:26:29 2015 UTC,29!
whitesox,3a80r8,ricker182,3,Thu Jun 18 01:18:03 2015 UTC,"Arquimedes, like archimedes with a Q? How the hell did his parents come up with that one?"

whitesox,3a80r8,unshifted,3,Thu Jun 18 06:04:03 2015 UTC,The Pirates are such a good defensive team.
whitesox,3a80r8,froglegs_jackson,3,Thu Jun 18 02:00:28 2015 UTC,"They just seem solid all around. They don't have the slugging first baseman, but Kang seems to be able to fill that role. It's nice having McCutchen, IDK about their bullpen but they seemed to be built pretty well,"
whitesox,3a80r8,samlincoln,3,Thu Jun 18 02:06:32 2015 UTC,We have our slugging 1B in Alverez but we sit him vs lefties cos hes awful against lefties.
whitesox,3a80r8,IYolkTheGarden,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:31:55 2015 UTC,they are not known for their defense just getting a bit lucky today I think. I checked and they have 45 errors(tied with us and ranked 23rd).
whitesox,3a80r8,ChiTownSox,2,Thu Jun 18 02:13:00 2015 UTC,It's almost like John Danks is one of the worst pitchers in Major League Baseball.
whitesox,3a80r8,froglegs_jackson,2,Thu Jun 18 00:19:27 2015 UTC,I almost feel bad for Danks. Almost...he's still very well paid.
whitesox,3a80r8,samlincoln,2,Thu Jun 18 00:21:05 2015 UTC,The White Sox are paying Melky & Danks a combined 27 (!!!) million dollars this year.
whitesox,3a80r8,froglegs_jackson,2,Thu Jun 18 00:26:22 2015 UTC,So far we're on pace to match the 2014 team.   ...FUCK!
whitesox,3a80r8,NineduceXII,2,Thu Jun 18 00:37:19 2015 UTC,"The 2014 team was more fun to watch, bullpen dumpster fire included. At least that team could actually score some runs."
whitesox,3a80r8,socklessmoejohnson,2,Thu Jun 18 01:09:05 2015 UTC,That's a shit interference call. Melkey is swinging hard as shit lost his balance and he falls out to the 1st base side. Bullshit.
whitesox,3a80r8,NineduceXII,2,Thu Jun 18 01:12:01 2015 UTC,Cancel the post-game show. Abreu doing Abreu things.
whitesox,3a80r8,NineduceXII,2,Thu Jun 18 01:13:41 2015 UTC,How can we go from hitting like we were last year to hitting like we are now? The offense isn't very different.
whitesox,3a80r8,ricker182,2,Thu Jun 18 01:17:12 2015 UTC,You would even go on to believe that our offense would be better since we added better players to our lineup.
whitesox,3a80r8,aviddemon,2,Thu Jun 18 01:21:34 2015 UTC,Right?   WE WERE HITTING BETTER WITH DE AZA AND VICIEDO.   just let that sink in for a minute.
whitesox,3a80r8,chocoholicsoxfan,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:36:25 2015 UTC,Some of our players are oil and some are water. They just don't mix. The chemistry isn't there.
whitesox,3a80r8,NineduceXII,2,Thu Jun 18 01:28:36 2015 UTC,Does anybody remember that last time we scored a run?
whitesox,3a80r8,frankin_berry,3,Thu Jun 18 01:22:01 2015 UTC,Some say it was in 2015. I'm skeptical.
whitesox,3a80r8,ADS94,2,Thu Jun 18 01:23:39 2015 UTC,Sure do! 29 innings ago!
whitesox,3a80r8,bababooey55,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:23:34 2015 UTC,29 innings ago
whitesox,3a80r8,ricker182,2,Thu Jun 18 01:23:19 2015 UTC,"So if we are shutout tonight, there is a very fair chance we set the record for most innings without a run with Cole pitching tomorrow."
whitesox,3a80r8,bababooey55,2,Thu Jun 18 01:30:37 2015 UTC,If?  lol
whitesox,3a80r8,chocoholicsoxfan,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:32:44 2015 UTC,"What is the record? We are at what, 32, for us now? If we're 8 games under after tonight IDK if I'll root for that history, maybe if it were August. If we're gonna be bad let's at least be fantastically, record-breaking, bad."
whitesox,3a80r8,samlincoln,2,Thu Jun 18 01:34:40 2015 UTC,"We're at 30, record is 42"

whitesox,3a80r8,heavykevy1983,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:10:31 2015 UTC,I agree with the Umps call. But I agree with Robin arguing. He has to try to fire this team up.
whitesox,3a80r8,samlincoln,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:11:26 2015 UTC,"I swear to god, every time we try stealing a base and a guy strikes out, we always get called for interference.  This one may have been questionable, but most of the time it isn't.   I also think that's the first time all season I've seen Robin show some emotion."
whitesox,3a80r8,dhcrazy333,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:13:23 2015 UTC,"I mean, the team may suck, but I gotta admit, I really enjoyed the post game fireworks last time I was there. We won, so I'm sure that made it better."
whitesox,3a80r8,ADS94,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:25:57 2015 UTC,Danks has is 2 hard hit outs away from sitting on a QS. After the first inning I wouldn't have believed that.
whitesox,3a80r8,samlincoln,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:32:36 2015 UTC,So John gets the quality start.   Did not see that coming.

whitesox,3a80r8,ADS94,2,Thu Jun 18 01:43:05 2015 UTC,We better fucking win now. And go on a huge winning streak.

whitesox,3a80r8,samlincoln,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:50:30 2015 UTC,Good to see Danks smile. I'd feel like shit if I were him after that first inning given his recent run.
whitesox,3a80r8,samlincoln,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:55:26 2015 UTC,"Fast game, Danks really got rolling. Our offense always doesn't take much time."

whitesox,3a79q5,DocKarate,12,Wed Jun 17 19:56:14 2015 UTC,As a gay Sox fan this confused me for a second
whitesox,3a79q5,mattjj13,3,Wed Jun 17 21:37:14 2015 UTC,"My family used to be season ticket holders a few years back.  We always enjoyed going to Grinder Bash.  Basically, we get to go tour the park (ie. dugouts, visitor clubhouse, Jim Beam suites, walk the warning track, FUNdamentals deck, etc.) while getting unlimited amounts of food and beer in the Bullpen Sports Bar.  They also have the White Sox Garage Sale open where you can buy a variety of game used items (balls, bats, helmets, jerseys, etc.).  The prices of these items obviously vary greatly depending on the player.  All in all it's a good time touring parts of the stadium you haven't been to before while indulging yourself on free food and beer (just make sure you have a DD)."
whitesox,3a79q5,tjg2838,2,Wed Jun 17 20:21:39 2015 UTC,Very cool to hear. My wife is pretty excited now. Thanks!

whitesox,3a3bk9,bababooey55,7,Wed Jun 17 01:08:56 2015 UTC,That the base running coaches are all still there is completely unacceptable. Seems like the only time we manage to steal is when the other team fucks up.
whitesox,3a3bk9,chocoholicsoxfan,6,Wed Jun 17 01:23:09 2015 UTC,The fact that there is someone being paid actual money to coach base-running for this team absolutely blows my mind.

I didn't really care either way, but if I had to pick one team, it was Tampa because I have friend on facebook who was so annoying throughout the hockey playoffs.  I was hoping Tampa would win so I can rip him for that.  I just never liked hockey and don't think I ever will.    I love how everybody is a hawks fan now.  Where was all this love 7 years ago?

Or if you're referring to the fact the hawks were not on tv until the old man died, then I get that also."

Sadly my sox fandom has diminished a lot and my Hawks fandom has really just risen Soo much. I was a fan of the Hawks in the dark years and it's just shocking to see them being voted the worst franchise in all of sports too being the most successful sports team in all of sports. I love the sox, but I just can't watch baseball anymore, it's just too slow. It's Soo tough going from the insanity and explosiveness that is playoff hockey and go to baseball."

whitesox,39zpbc,todd330,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:01:06 2015 UTC,"but the difference is the sox actually spend good money to get players that should be performing. Bill wirtz did none of this, traded great players, blacked out home games, Dollarbill wirtz managed to alienate the fans, and get people to not go to Hawks games. I was at the Hawks/wings home opener on 07 when he died, that stadium was full and everyone there booed Bill wirtz during the moment of silence for his death. That is what made Rocky wirtz change the Hawks around! The sox fans are much different, even when the sox are doing great there aren't fans in the stadium."

When I remember this season though, I'm going to remember D-Rob striking out the side. Chris Sale's inevitable 2015 Cy Young victory. All of the awesome swag they give away. All of the walk-off wins. Sweeping the A's & the Astros.  This isn't a bad team, they're just underachieving. It's not over until we're mathematically eliminated."

whitesox,39z51k,MustacheMark,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:17:17 2015 UTC,"Not really. Only one person is hitting above .270 & that's Micah Johnson. Kyle Drabek & Erik Johnson have been pitching well and I wouldn't be surprised if they were to pitch better than Danks. Our single-A & A+ teams look as if they don't feature any hitters that will sniff the big leagues. Majority of them are about two years older than the average age. Same can be said for AA. Only Tim Anderson is the only hitter in the entire minor league system that looks to have a future in the Majors. Of course, Hawkins will get a shot, but he's back to being the strikeout machine that hits at a low average. Even his power is down. Year after year they fail to draft & produce any offense. Beckham is literally the only position player on the big league roster that was drafted and he doesn't even start."

whitesox,39yu3u,E-raticMenace,9,Mon Jun 15 22:38:00 2015 UTC,"Sucks that /r/baseball paints him as basically just a giant douchebag. Interviews like this show he really cares about the team.

whitesox,39yu3u,samlincoln,3,Mon Jun 15 23:59:20 2015 UTC,"I've seen a decent amount of criticism about his personality for two reasons.   1) When he allegedly tried to get into the Royals clubhouse   2) When he accused Detroit of stealing signs  I mean, he doesn't get as much criticism as AJ, but I think they still see him as one of the douchiest pitchers in the league."
whitesox,39yu3u,Georgie56,6,Tue Jun 16 00:02:20 2015 UTC,Some things I can think of that might be keeping him happy with this org:   Working with coop  How he was fast tracked to the majors  Lax clubhouse and easygoing manger (which is not really working out)
whitesox,39yu3u,PigFarmington,3,Tue Jun 16 03:43:19 2015 UTC,It's not his fault. Just have a lot of incompetent players.

whitesox,39y7hv,Boopa1219,2,Mon Jun 15 22:11:24 2015 UTC,"How does that not make sense? You're claiming a better record = better manager? Nope, that's not how that works exactly. Managers don't lose games, players do. For example, Steve Kerr is a first time coach on Golden State, yet people know he was just put into a good position with amazing players at his disposable. Sure, he could be a good coach on top of that, but people know it's the players, not him winning the game. Padres roster sucks, yet they are winning game, yes. But that's just how baseball works sometimes. Plus we aren't even half way into the season yet, and fans are already counting us out. 7 games behind isn't a impossible task. Blue Jays are on a 11 game winning streak right now."

whitesox,39y7hv,AnniesBoobzz,2,Mon Jun 15 23:32:13 2015 UTC,Im lukewarm to Robin. Our players still are playing like garbage. But its just the management/front office in general that bothers me.

whitesox,39u1ty,hailthebasilisk,-4,Mon Jun 15 00:54:34 2015 UTC,You are getting down votes. I tried to help. People love Sale too much to admit that he let up a 2-run homer before he left the game. I don't understand their perception of today's game.
whitesox,39u1ty,roofkelly,9,Mon Jun 15 03:23:30 2015 UTC,You're seriously going to fault Sale? It was one mistake.

That being said, just because we like Sale doesn't mean he didn't let up more runs than the other team.   Edit: for the record, Sale is my favorite player and he pitched great.  I'm just saying the bullpen didn't lose today's game by any stretch of the imagination."
whitesox,39u1ty,roofkelly,4,Mon Jun 15 03:48:32 2015 UTC,It's the offense's fault we lost today. Plain and simple.
whitesox,39u1ty,ricker182,2,Mon Jun 15 04:23:50 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the help. I knew I was posting an unpopular sentiment, but the truth is that when a shitty offense doesn't give an amazing pitcher any support game after game frustration becomes a thing. Especially when that pitcher is as fiery as Sale is. Anyone who reads my posts can see that I am a huge Sale fan, I only felt like I had to correct the statement that our bullpen lost the game yesterday because it was not factual. Our bullpen gave up zero runs yesterday. Downvote me if you want to but the facts remain.  Edit: Sale did pitch an amazing game, and it was only one mistake. To a club that can score runs that would've been no big deal. I get that."

whitesox,39u1ty,Mrslinger85,1 point,Mon Jun 15 13:01:38 2015 UTC,"Beckham, Ramirez, Eaton, Cabrera, Sanchez, and Flowers all have an OBP less than .300.  Garcia, LaRoche, and Abreu are the only ones sporting respectable OBP, but none of them are that great.  I was expecting a lot more from Eaton (2014 OBP .362) and Cabrere (career OBP .336).  You can't win games with 2/3 of your lineup performing at less than replacement level production.    JB Schuck should be seeing a lot more playing time and I wouldn't mind if they recalled Micah Johnson, defense be damned.  I would even considered calling up Tim Anderson who has been faring pretty well in AA.  He can't do much worse than Alexei.  I was really excited about the off-season acquisition, just like all of you.  However, I wasn't unrealistic about the potential of this team.  Even with the Melky, Duke, Robertson, and Samardzija, I still had this team winning 80-82 with their opening day roster.  The hope was that they would be contenders for the division by the all-star break and make some mid-season moves.  They don't have a lot of farmhands to move, but they would likely be able to acquire pieces by taking on salary.  Well, as it stands now, the Sox will likely be sellers at the trade deadline.  IMO, this isn't so bad since they did not sign Samardzija to an extension, which I believe to be intentional.  KW always leaves himself an out and doesn't fully commit until he knows he has a winner.  I fully expect the Sox to move Samardzija unless they are able to stream together several winning series in a row.  I'd also be looking for them to move Duke, Alexei, and anyone else not name Abreu, Sale, Quintana, Rodon, Robertson, and Garcia.  I wouldn't be shock the had a better second half after trading half the team."

Usually, the game day pitcher has very limited interaction with everyone on game day. 99.9% he will be in the bullpen, or the clubhouse, going over scouting reports and getting his warm up in.   Chris has always been great about signing though; if you can catch him pre-game in the bullpen on his off days (throwing sessions) he'll sign for all the kids. I would recommend heading out to a BP on a side session day for him; which would be 2-3 days after he pitches."

whitesox,39e70q,ACSimeon,3,Thu Jun 11 21:32:17 2015 UTC,"When they are on their game, we have the best starting pitching in the leauge.   My two teams are the White Sox and Cardinals. I understand optimism and believing in your team, but the Sox do not have the best starting pitching in the league. They may have the best starting pitcher in the league, but the rest of the rotation struggles. You can throw out how Quintana looks good, how Rodon has so much potential, and how Samardzija has to get better, but I'm around die hard Cardinals fans on a daily basis (live in STL) and there are simply much higher expectations. Sale is the only starter that has an ERA under 4.00 for the Sox. Wainwright went down early for the Cardinals, and still every single starter for them has an ERA under 4.00. Its so obvious to me because I frequent both the cardinals subreddit and this subreddit so often, but the difference in viewpoint is remarkable. Sox fans right now view the team in terms of what they ""could be"" or ""should be"", and this leads to unrealistic opinions and expectations. The Sox do not have the best starting pitching in the league, and you're fooling yourself if you think that. Plus, it'll only make you upset when you watch them because you will always perceive them as underperforming. Samardzija is underperforming, everybody else is pitching about at the level that most people expected."
whitesox,39e70q,cardsfan1343,4,Thu Jun 11 05:07:01 2015 UTC,"Sale, Quintana, and Rodon are good. Danks and Shark are flat out terrible. The problem is that the White Sox only have 3 starters they can routinely depend on, bad hitting, and bad defense. This sweep has been nice but we are still in 4th place in the division."
whitesox,39e70q,ggslovin,4,Fri Jun 12 02:06:26 2015 UTC,"I like Shark to rebound, and Danks isn't terrible for a back-end starter, he's terrible for being the highest paid player on the team."
whitesox,39e70q,ACSimeon,22,Thu Jun 11 14:08:51 2015 UTC,I don't think the Astros are as good as people think.
whitesox,39e70q,ricker182,9,Thu Jun 11 21:30:08 2015 UTC,"I agree. The White Sox didn't even look that great this series & still swept the Astros. I think Houston will be good with all that young talent, but I still don't see a playoff team this year and maybe not even next year."

whitesox,39e70q,samlincoln,8,Thu Jun 11 12:44:26 2015 UTC,Usually when a good team gets swept it gets a thread in /r/baseball. Instead the hill gets credit as the astros are 0-7 since removing it (coincidence).  This team doesn't really deserve to be talked about outside of Sale. We gotta keep going. This feels like a .500 team that's gonna run hot and cold and drive me crazy.
whitesox,39e70q,Mrslinger85,8,Thu Jun 11 22:01:38 2015 UTC,"If the offense can actually do something, I think this team could win the division.  We have as good of a pitching staff as anyone, but the offensive production the Sox have is a joke outside of a few players.   Edit: also Fuck r/baseball.  Its basically just Royals fans posting highlights of their team."
whitesox,39e70q,samlincoln,3,Thu Jun 11 11:27:32 2015 UTC,"There's a chance that Samardzija ends up our 4th best starting pitcher. That speaks for itself.   Abreu is going to rake. Avi is a young star, if he didn't hurt his knee, he'd be getting talked up more, he's back in the swing. LaRoche is capable of carrying a team for a few weeks (ask Nationals fans). Veterans Melky and Alexei are going to regress. Maybe Eaton has near the 2nd half he did last year. We're in good shape. Micah Johnson is an awesome september call up if we're still in the race then. The talent was never really a question. I want to believe but we gotta keep it up and get over .500"
whitesox,39e70q,Mrslinger85,2,Thu Jun 11 16:26:56 2015 UTC,"The guys I'm really thinking that can improve are Alexi, Melky, Eaton, and possibly Gillespie.  I would love Flowers to be better, but I don't think that's going to happen.  Looking at those first 4 though, they all did better in prior seasons. LaRoche is pretty much playing as expected, and he at least draws walks."
whitesox,39e70q,samlincoln,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:52:39 2015 UTC,"I should have said positive regression. These guys have track records better than this.   Dare I say, Soto may end up being a competent hitting catcher as it warms up. Soto doesn't have to really tear it up to be better than flowers.   Gillespie has that plantar fasciitis, it really worries me, but my god I love his swing. Related, at 3B I'm grateful for Beckham, If Bonifacio were backing up Conor while he is handling his foot issue, we'd be in trouble, esp after his game last night."
whitesox,39e70q,Mrslinger85,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:02:42 2015 UTC,Do we have any word with what's going on with Johnson?  His defense certainly isn't any worse than Bonifacio's and he was at least hitting.

whitesox,39e70q,mushperv,3,Thu Jun 11 23:06:35 2015 UTC,I think our pitching had looked really strong of late. Everyone outside of Shark is dealing.  Team still can't score runs tho. Interested to see if Hahn sells off pieces or tries to buy a bat or two.

whitesox,39d2mi,doyouevenIift,2,Thu Jun 11 03:18:54 2015 UTC,It was close but I definitely think Adam was out. He slid with his foot kind of pointing up so he missed the plate at first
whitesox,39d2mi,dhcrazy333,2,Thu Jun 11 03:16:53 2015 UTC,He was out. There's an angle that shows it pretty clearly.

whitesox,39d2mi,bababooey55,3,Thu Jun 11 03:20:14 2015 UTC,Agreed.  That angle was pretty obvious.

whitesox,39d2mi,loulevin19,3,Thu Jun 11 03:16:00 2015 UTC,He was clearly tagged before his toe hit the plate. There was absolutely evidence that he was tagged. The view up the 3rd base line is quite clear.

Me: ""dude, were going to the super bowl this year!"" Friend: ""don't be such a homer!""  Clearly this Hawk guy is a hometown favorite, no offense intended.. :/"
whitesox,39e6ql,Aperture-Employee,6,Thu Jun 11 04:02:56 2015 UTC,He loves the Sox more than anyone else and he's very often blinded by it. But he wears his heart on his sleeve and always says what a lot of us are thinking.
whitesox,39e6ql,ricker182,6,Thu Jun 11 04:06:20 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Every team should have that guy. The cubs had Santo, albeit on the radio, but the homerism is a key piece of entertainment."
whitesox,39e6ql,samlincoln,2,Thu Jun 11 04:33:53 2015 UTC,"Sorry about the downvotes. Hawk is hated across baseball. I love him because nostalgia, and enthusiasm. Sometimes it's like he's cheering or bitching with me when I'm watching. When he's pissed I love him venting. He truly loves the White Sox I could imagine disliking him as a non-chisox fan. I have yet to meet a non White Sox fan that likes hawk harrelson."
whitesox,39e6ql,DomCaboose,2,Thu Jun 11 11:29:44 2015 UTC,You really don't know what a homer means do you?
whitesox,39e6ql,DomCaboose,3,Thu Jun 11 11:59:59 2015 UTC,loving a team so much that you're blinded by it. Down here in Texas we call those people Aggies
whitesox,39e6ql,Georgie56,1 point,Thu Jun 11 13:22:07 2015 UTC,That's because that's for a specific team. I was just checking. I get why you would call them aggies
whitesox,39e6ql,dhcrazy333,5,Thu Jun 11 14:37:30 2015 UTC,"Hawk is one of those commentators you either love or hate. I like him. Despite his homerism, he will give props to an opposing team's player for a great play."
whitesox,39e6ql,waff1ez,3,Thu Jun 11 04:59:25 2015 UTC,"I love Hawk for his homerism because he actually is excited about the team. He does always say ""He Gone"" after strikeouts.   And he was also completely wrong on that LaRoche slide.  LaRoche was clearly out."
whitesox,398rlc,RaymondNoodlez,4,Wed Jun 10 01:59:47 2015 UTC,I don't know much about baseball drafts. Is he happy just to get drafted at #8 or is he happy to go to the Sox?
whitesox,398rlc,_Shut_Up_Thats_Why_,12,Wed Jun 10 03:37:49 2015 UTC,Both. I read that he's really excited about the white sox because he's from the same town as Chris Sale and he's a huge fan of Chris Sale
whitesox,398rlc,Immature_20_year_Old,2,Wed Jun 10 12:38:47 2015 UTC,He's also joining one of the best rotations in baseball with Rodon & Quintana.
whitesox,398rlc,ACSimeon,4,Wed Jun 10 15:59:23 2015 UTC,"I think probably being drafted. Maybe both, but most likely it's just being drafted"
whitesox,398rlc,E-raticMenace,3,Wed Jun 10 03:49:16 2015 UTC,"I'm sure it's a bit of both, but I would assume his initial excitement is from the fact that he got drafted. The rest is just the icing on the cake for him."
whitesox,398rlc,Come_Sale_Away,2,Wed Jun 10 03:50:09 2015 UTC,"Love videos like this. Good for him, and it's awesome to see how happy his teammates are, too."

whitesox,398rlc,GenericCheesePuffs,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:23:22 2015 UTC,People didn't think Rodon would be a solid starter this quickly either
whitesox,398rlc,Kumdogmillionaire,2,Wed Jun 10 18:56:14 2015 UTC,"No, people thought he'd probably be able to join the Majors quickly after being drafted"
whitesox,398rlc,GenericCheesePuffs,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:44:50 2015 UTC,"Makes me extremely happy that the White Sox drafted a righty this time around. Whether he finds himself in the rotation or coming out of the pen, Fulmer has enormous upside"
whitesox,39771e,soxfan1487,16,Tue Jun 9 19:20:34 2015 UTC,Kind of the best starting pitcher in baseball.
whitesox,39771e,ACSimeon,9,Tue Jun 9 19:47:47 2015 UTC,"I also liked the related article at the bottom ""Chris Sale Does Not Have Bones In His Body..."""
whitesox,39771e,crak6389,6,Tue Jun 9 21:06:23 2015 UTC,Wasn't he #3 in AL Cy Young voting last year?
whitesox,39771e,Brian33,3,Tue Jun 9 23:22:59 2015 UTC,Also should've had the ERA title. If only they didn't feel bad for Hernandez and change his higher ERA at the last second.
whitesox,39771e,NineduceXII,2,Wed Jun 10 00:30:53 2015 UTC,What happened with Hernandez?
whitesox,39771e,hairlessknee,4,Wed Jun 10 04:03:03 2015 UTC,He had a higher ERA than Chris near the end of the season but much later they decided that the runs that caused the higher ERA were errors so they removed those from this final count. Thus he won the ERA title.   Edit: Article - http://mweb.cbssports.com/mlb/eye-on-baseball/24726914/scoring-change-gives-felix-hernandez-shot-at-al-era-title
whitesox,39771e,NineduceXII,2,Wed Jun 10 04:30:22 2015 UTC,He gets plenty of respect. NYT had a large article comparing him to Randy Johnson and he was picked to win the Cy Young by quite a few national writers.
whitesox,3981oi,jrerik95,2,Tue Jun 9 22:43:42 2015 UTC,"He's one of our gaudiest pitching prospects. Can bring the heat. I am really excited about this guy. We develop pitchers so well, can we just get a FEW position players."
whitesox,3981oi,samlincoln,2,Wed Jun 10 01:21:45 2015 UTC,Any reason for this only being 7 innings?
whitesox,3981oi,pohodo3,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:02:32 2015 UTC,Doubleheaders in the MiLB only go 7 innings
whitesox,3981oi,CheddarGuevara,2,Wed Jun 10 00:50:34 2015 UTC,"Awesome. Hopefully this puts the question of him being able to stick in a rotation to rest! He seems to have the heat for a reliever, but the stamina for a starter. Really like this kid."

whitesox,3999ku,kennysci,2,Wed Jun 10 22:18:44 2015 UTC,"It's been fun so far. I just try to choose the most compelling games that day considering pitching matchups, rivalries, etc. and try to mix it up a bit so it's kind of a way to follow the entire league. I haven't repeated a team this week. Gonna try out a day game today and see how that works out."
whitesox,3985yk,chisoxbot,16,Tue Jun 9 23:14:14 2015 UTC,"Here's why I'm still optimistic the White Sox will turn it around in the second half of the season.  1) Veteran roster, knows it's a long season. Clearly saving some of their better stuff in the tank.  2) Baseball is all about pitching. We have Christ Sale. Carlos Rodon & Quintana are proving they belong in the rotation with every quality start. Samardzija is on a 1 year deal, and he knows if he doesn't start getting his shit together, there won't be an extension.  3) Jose Abreu. Jose bats third.  4) Maybe this team has been so disappointing that some kid's dad walked out on him and said he'd come back when this team turns it around. So that kid wished for angels to help our White Sox win. It happened for Anaheim that one time.  5) Duke, Petricka, Putnam, Guerra, and (situationally) even Jennings are good relievers.  6) We could also get Nate Jones & Matt Albers back at some point.  7) We have a certified Closer. D-Rob only has 3 blown saves, and two of those he salvaged for a win."
whitesox,3985yk,ACSimeon,5,Wed Jun 10 01:37:03 2015 UTC,"For point number 6, you forgot about Jesse Crain, who did great things for us in '13."
whitesox,3985yk,chocoholicsoxfan,5,Wed Jun 10 02:20:28 2015 UTC,"Really hope he can come back healthy, but it's hard to be optimistic. Hasn't pitched in the majors since we traded him I think. That kind of addition in the second half could be huge for a bullpen though."
whitesox,3985yk,AnniesBoobzz,3,Wed Jun 10 03:32:00 2015 UTC,"You could have Jeff Samardzija as your 4th best pitcher. That's something else. I still have hope too. Another point is that the AL is full of parity and the top teams like the Twins and Astros should regress a little. With those 2 wildcard spots, a few games over .500 can get us into the playoffs."
whitesox,3985yk,samlincoln,3,Wed Jun 10 02:12:12 2015 UTC,Number 4 - I love that movie!
whitesox,3985yk,ZeldaFreak1000,10,Wed Jun 10 14:04:53 2015 UTC,Team isn't going to really get out of this slump unless the bottom of the order at least somewhat produces. Bring Micah back. We can't do much about the catcher situation but when there are 2-4 rally stoppers in a row... that's a big problem.
whitesox,3985yk,bababooey55,3,Wed Jun 10 01:43:38 2015 UTC,Agreed.
whitesox,3985yk,ricker182,3,Wed Jun 10 01:44:27 2015 UTC,How does Sanchez go from hitting .344 in AAA to .150 in the MLB? I know hitting isn't his forte but shit is that awful
whitesox,3985yk,callmeroo,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:07:22 2015 UTC,Baffles me too. He had the same problem last year too when he got called up after a solid year in AAA. It's like he's really just not ready for big league pitching. He looks lost up there.

whitesox,3985yk,chocoholicsoxfan,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:36:41 2015 UTC,I'll probably be working...so.... yeah. No pizza for me.
whitesox,3985yk,ricker182,2,Wed Jun 10 02:38:22 2015 UTC,Hopefully. Actually I don't really care. It's never free. You pay in one way or another.
whitesox,3985yk,ricker182,3,Wed Jun 10 02:39:20 2015 UTC,Yup. This is gonna happen. Bases loaded no outs. No runs.
whitesox,3985yk,ricker182,3,Wed Jun 10 02:38:36 2015 UTC,FUCKING BONIFACIO  FUCKING FLOWERS  ARE YOU SERIOUS?!
whitesox,3985yk,ACSimeon,3,Wed Jun 10 00:43:29 2015 UTC,Can we seriously just get rid of Flowers and Soto. It can't get any worse. Bring somebody up.
whitesox,3985yk,ricker182,3,Wed Jun 10 00:44:12 2015 UTC,"I can't think of another player that I disliked more than Tyler Flowers. He doesn't bring anything to the table. He wasn't the only that couldn't drive in a run this inning, but idk if anyone expected Flowers to come through."
whitesox,3985yk,JBProds,2,Wed Jun 10 00:44:43 2015 UTC,"I've been saying it ever since Flowers came up.  He has the worst swing I've ever seen.  It's slow, long, wobbly, it just looks awkward.  I'm surprised any time he makes contact."
whitesox,3985yk,dhcrazy333,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:46:01 2015 UTC,Getting struck out with the bases loaded is demotion-worthy.
whitesox,3985yk,ACSimeon,3,Wed Jun 10 00:54:06 2015 UTC,"If that's the case, half the lineup would be sent down. lol In all seriousness, I'm not sure if Flowers would start for any other big league team."
whitesox,3985yk,JBProds,3,Wed Jun 10 00:48:52 2015 UTC,"I think if we hadn't traded Josh Phegley, he would be getting as many starts as Flowers."
whitesox,3985yk,ACSimeon,3,Wed Jun 10 00:53:19 2015 UTC,"Phegley was better in my eyes. He wasn't given as many chances as the White Sox gave Flowers. Plus, Phegley won a Gold Glove in AAA. He had a really good arm too."
whitesox,3985yk,JBProds,2,Wed Jun 10 00:54:15 2015 UTC,In 67 abs he's hitting .313. Not a huge sample size but it's considerably better than flowers.
whitesox,3985yk,waff1ez,3,Wed Jun 10 00:58:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Samardzija really needs to start earning his keep. Or else we might see if it's not too late to go to Oakland asking for Takesies-Backsies."
whitesox,3985yk,ACSimeon,3,Wed Jun 10 01:00:15 2015 UTC,Oh god no.. Maybe for a aaa team but not an mlb team.
whitesox,3985yk,waff1ez,2,Wed Jun 10 01:03:23 2015 UTC,It is against the leading Cy Young candidate. But I think any pitcher would have got him there.
whitesox,3985yk,samlincoln,3,Wed Jun 10 00:55:10 2015 UTC,I hated flowers even when he was just a backup for AJ. Beckham and Boneheadfacio didn't help there either though.

whitesox,396z7d,JBProds,2,Tue Jun 9 18:29:25 2015 UTC,"Not a fan of this pick either judging by his stats but if there's one thing the sox do pretty well its develop pitchers, LHP at that, so take that away from this at least. It's frustrating how poorly we draft position players though, that needs to change ASAP if this team is going to have any success in the future."
whitesox,396z7d,callmeroo,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:58:29 2015 UTC,"They only develop pitchers that have been highly regarded coming into the draft. Rodon, Danish, Adams & the other pitching prospects had at least one plus pitch. Aside from Fulmer, it looks as if the White Sox have only made one other solid pick. The others have been reaches to say the least."
whitesox,396z7d,callmeroo,2,Wed Jun 10 02:05:45 2015 UTC,This is my concern. The Sox don't just make good pitchers out of everyone. Coop is a good pitching coach but isn't a miracle worker.  Sometimes reaches pan out. I'm hoping that's the case but it might just be more of the same garbage we're used to.
whitesox,396z7d,anustart_analrapist,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:56:29 2015 UTC,Still takes some development on their end though regardless of talent but I see what you mean. Its bittersweet that our prospects don't pan out in general though so trading them has never been an issue in that sense. Correct me if I'm wrong but is gio gonzalez the last sox prospect to be traded away/let go and really make an impact? And even then he was crazy wild for a couple years then sorted things out.
whitesox,396z7d,hailthebasilisk,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:12:34 2015 UTC,"I think Gio is in fact the only one that played at an All Star level. That hurt. I loved Gio & when he was traded for a player I already despised in Swisher… let's just say my Saturday was ruined. Chris Carter was also part of the trade. Low BA, but 37 HRs last season & 29 the year before is pretty good. Trading Daniel Hudson for Edwin Jackson pissed me off the first year after the trade. If not for an injury, who knows what Hudson could've been. The problem with trading our prized prospect at the time I had was that they never acquired a good player. C'mon man. Edwin Jackson, an often-injured and derailing Jake Peavy, Nick Swisher, etc."
whitesox,396z7d,ACSimeon,5,Wed Jun 10 02:30:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah this pick doesn't make much sense to me.. This team fails to score very much runs and we already have a lefty crowded rotation. Maybe they see something we haven't, but after already taking a pitcher with the first round pick I wish they would've taken a power hitter with this pick. We lack power which is something in the past we've been known for."
whitesox,396z7d,ACSimeon,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:52:15 2015 UTC,"A big reason why this team fails to develop many stars is because they like to draft to draft players that grew up around Chicago. They draft way too many players like that. Erwin, born in Chicago, probably wouldn't have been drafted within the first 15 rounds according the MLB Draft stream I've been watching. Petricka, Rodon, Sale, Webb & Beckham are the only players on the team that were drafted by the White Sox. Beckham being the only position player is sad."
whitesox,396z7d,ACSimeon,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:59:15 2015 UTC,"Seriously. Do we even have top prospects in the fielding positions? I understand our bullpen is usually weak, but goddamn the era of the hitless wonders is near to forever ago. When can we become an offensive team and score some runs? Our run differential is a joke."
whitesox,396z7d,Cheeky_buggah,3,Tue Jun 9 21:57:14 2015 UTC,"Tim Anderson will be the top prospect once Rodon loses eligibility which should happen soon. Then Hawkins should be around 5-8 while Davidson has plummeted. OF Jacob May was looking really good in AA, but then he got hurt in that collision with Anderson. Aside from May, all these ""top"" prospects look similar to the hitters we already have. High strikeout rate, low OBP and low batting average. Well Anderson is also an exception for low batting average. He gets hits, but he has the worst patience at the plate. Had 5 walks in 236 plate appearances."
whitesox,396z7d,waff1ez,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:25:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this looks like a throwaway pick. All due respect to Zack."
whitesox,396z7d,tgentil,4,Tue Jun 9 20:31:24 2015 UTC,A team like the White Sox can't afford any picks like this. I would've preferred Long Beach State (an MLB producing factory) ace Kyle Friedrichs who wasn't selected until the 7th round. Had a 2.79 ERA in his first full season after Tommy John. Posted a ridiculous 109 to 12 K to BB ratio.

whitesox,393gq1,SuperBowlDolphin,9,Tue Jun 9 00:02:32 2015 UTC,"He has a fastball around 98 a change that needs work and a laborious windup that may hinder his ability to start but he projects as a #2 starter. His stat line is something  like 1.82 era .186 OBA 12k/9 He is known for his work ethic, leadership abilities, and strive for greatness. I had him pegged as the best college pitcher going in to the draft. And he apparently likes Italian food."
whitesox,393gq1,panda_zombies,7,Tue Jun 9 00:03:14 2015 UTC,"Gammons said we just got the best pitcher in the draft two years in a row (Rodon last year obviously). Crazy how fast Fulmer became elite as a starter this past year. Had 10 starts the year before, but was a reliever as well. This year was a full time starter and he dominated. Hope his windup gets a little slowed down though, but I'm not too worried."
whitesox,393gq1,SuperBowlDolphin,6,Tue Jun 9 00:20:49 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna be honest. I'm just a vandy fan and don't watch too much of him. But his personality & always being the last one on the field shows that he wants to be the best. Combine that with his strikeouts, I think he might be one of the best in the draft"
whitesox,393gq1,tdov,3,Tue Jun 9 01:08:36 2015 UTC,"He could come up this year in like September as a reliever, or next year as a starter hands down.   He's got a finicky windup, and he'll probably have to tone that down to stay in the rotation long term. But that 98 fastball is sexy.   Also now I really like your team. Repping both my college allegiances. I'm soooo glad y'all got Shark."
whitesox,393gq1,samurai5625,3,Tue Jun 9 00:04:48 2015 UTC,"I'm hyped as hell for this guy. Hits 98 with the fastball, just hope he sticks in the rotation."

whitesox,393gq1,Cheeky_buggah,7,Tue Jun 9 00:05:18 2015 UTC,Now if only our farm system knew how to develop position players like it generates left handed pitchers.
whitesox,393gq1,TheHoneyBadger23,4,Tue Jun 9 01:58:49 2015 UTC,"Looking at his highlights this dude has some serious swagger, which isn't a bad thing. His delivery and violent motion seem to fit the bullpen better, I hope that's not the case"

whitesox,393gq1,samlincoln,2,Tue Jun 9 01:14:48 2015 UTC,"So happy with this pick, didn't think he would fall too us. Too bad we have so few picks."
whitesox,393gq1,samlincoln,4,Tue Jun 9 00:21:32 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Only pick for the day, but at least they made it count."
whitesox,393wx7,ElTunaGrande,4,Tue Jun 9 02:07:34 2015 UTC,I was amazed by it. My roommate and girl friend didn't seem as enthused just that it wasn't 100.
whitesox,393gx9,JBProds,2,Tue Jun 9 00:02:05 2015 UTC,Holy shit.  I can already see it. 5 years from now starting a playoff series with Sale-Rodon-Fulmer.
whitesox,393gx9,Rkenz2,3,Tue Jun 9 06:07:59 2015 UTC,"Honestly, if Samardzija could just pull it together and sign an extension then he would solidify the rotation with another righty. But since we're talking 5 years, Tyler Danish or Spencer Adams could be in the rotation as well. I may be alone on this, but I haven't given up on Erik Johnson just yet."
whitesox,393gx9,samlincoln,2,Tue Jun 9 07:13:58 2015 UTC,Quintana will be 31 five years from now and he's not really a hard thrower. Quintana is better than Samardzija. I love it when even our own fans sleep on Q. Quintana is 4 years younger and look at these numbers:     fWAR by Year Q Shark    2013 3.3 2.9   2014 5.0 4.2   2015 1.4 1.0    Q's contract is also a great bargain.
whitesox,3929k1,AlphaDogRed,6,Mon Jun 8 18:57:56 2015 UTC,"Math isn't my best subject, but by my count he had 26."
whitesox,3929k1,ArtisticGuy,2,Tue Jun 9 04:13:27 2015 UTC,"Your math is correct, sir."
whitesox,3929k1,hailthebasilisk,4,Tue Jun 9 12:07:46 2015 UTC,Saler should have won last year's Cy Young. It's an absolute robbery that all the 1st place votes went to Klubot & King Felix.
whitesox,3929k1,ACSimeon,3,Tue Jun 9 12:15:39 2015 UTC,"Nah Kluber deserved it.  Sale would have had a chance but he missed too much time last year, so his innings weren't up to par (only 174).  Kluber threw 61 more innings than Sale.  This year though Sale is consistently going into the 8th inning, so if he keeps this up he could definitely win."
whitesox,3929k1,Unknownentity7,0,Tue Jun 9 17:04:58 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying Kluber wasn't great, but I think Sale earned at least 1 first place vote. King Felix got 13."
whitesox,3929k1,ACSimeon,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:08:40 2015 UTC,"Sale and Klubot should've finished #1, #2, but I have no idea what order."
whitesox,3929k1,ViceroyFizzlebottom,2,Tue Jun 9 14:43:46 2015 UTC,Well Sale finished with 0 first place votes. I'm sure those are the same experts who thought Minnesota would be the only team with no shot at winning this division.
whitesox,3929k1,ACSimeon,3,Tue Jun 9 15:49:46 2015 UTC,I'd love to see this happen. It seems like most analysts just expect Sale to keep being amazing in the background and only talk about him in a surprised way when he has a bad game. Give those bastards something else to talk about tonight.
whitesox,3929k1,hailthebasilisk,3,Mon Jun 8 22:54:19 2015 UTC,Looks like he is going to do it!
whitesox,3929k1,max5470,1 point,Tue Jun 9 02:55:33 2015 UTC,Looks like he did it the box score for last nights game shows 26 swinging strikes.
whitesox,3929k1,jackarroo,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:27:11 2015 UTC,For Cy young I'd have Sale-Keuchel-King Felix as the top 3 as of now.

whitesox,393ax3,Cheeky_buggah,2,Tue Jun 9 03:17:16 2015 UTC,"I was listening to ESPN radio a few days ago and they were talking about this. It's basically because of the White Sox not being a big market and not winning. If he was in Boston, New York, and even with the Cubs he would be getting way more attention and recognition."

whitesox,393ax3,Cheeky_buggah,2,Tue Jun 9 02:08:02 2015 UTC,Yeah he's playing better for sure. His OBP is under-appreciated as well.

whitesox,393ax3,bababooey55,2,Tue Jun 9 02:12:05 2015 UTC,Why are we giving Carlos a pass on hitting <.150
whitesox,393ax3,max5470,2,Tue Jun 9 02:18:30 2015 UTC,"He's had a few clutch hits and is great defensively, but it is absolutely an issue that needs to be figured out soon. I don't want to keep sending players up and down but I think Johnson is the much better option right now. Carlos is basically an automatic out."

whitesox,38xk8x,Koneesha,1 point,Sun Jun 7 21:02:49 2015 UTC,Rios had a couple decent seasons. I enjoyed his time here. And that HR swing was always a thing of beauty.
whitesox,38xk8x,ricker182,2,Sun Jun 7 20:39:35 2015 UTC,True true.
whitesox,38xk8x,ricker182,3,Sun Jun 7 21:03:45 2015 UTC,When the fuck are we going to get good weather at home?
whitesox,38xk8x,ricker182,3,Sun Jun 7 18:27:02 2015 UTC,Told you.
whitesox,38xk8x,AnniesBoobzz,3,Sun Jun 7 18:31:50 2015 UTC,/u/ricker182 is gonna set a record for most comments in a game thread.
whitesox,38xk8x,KJzero9,2,Sun Jun 7 19:36:04 2015 UTC,Haha. Not my fault no one else wants to converse.
whitesox,38xk8x,bababooey55,3,Sun Jun 7 19:48:39 2015 UTC,Samardzija is the most bipolar pitcher I've ever seen.
whitesox,38xk8x,magooster,3,Sun Jun 7 19:57:36 2015 UTC,"Wow, that was an impressive catch by Avi"
whitesox,38xk8x,ricker182,3,Sun Jun 7 20:10:05 2015 UTC,Look like a AA lineup out there. Fucking awful.
whitesox,38xk8x,AnniesBoobzz,3,Sun Jun 7 20:15:26 2015 UTC,How come other teams like the Cardinals and the Tigers are solid every year and we are just dogshit.
whitesox,38xk8x,bababooey55,4,Sun Jun 7 20:28:21 2015 UTC,Better management. Good farm system.     To be fair the Tigers were really awful 10 years ago.
whitesox,38xk8x,samurai5625,3,Sun Jun 7 20:31:26 2015 UTC,They're gonna be terrible again soon enough. Their farm is awful and guys like Miggy and VMart only last so long.
whitesox,38xk8x,gotpez,2,Sun Jun 7 22:26:01 2015 UTC,Pretty much whenever Dombrowski came in as GM for the Tigers they became a yearly contender. A couple years of shifting things around but after that they're good every damn year.
whitesox,38xk8x,waff1ez,3,Sun Jun 7 20:43:37 2015 UTC,I'm really starting to hate this dogshit team.
whitesox,38xk8x,ricker182,3,Sun Jun 7 20:52:06 2015 UTC,Shark has been a pretty worthless acquisition. I'd like to see him traded
whitesox,38xk8x,ricker182,2,Sun Jun 7 22:15:34 2015 UTC,Classic Samardzija!
whitesox,38xk8x,loulevin19,2,Sun Jun 7 18:22:38 2015 UTC,I'm not convinced this game isn't over already.
whitesox,38xk8x,ricker182,2,Sun Jun 7 18:28:01 2015 UTC,Simon is leaving everything over the plate.
whitesox,38xk8x,loulevin19,2,Sun Jun 7 18:28:56 2015 UTC,Nice 2 out single... but there's just no way we're going to be able to make something of that
whitesox,38xk8x,bababooey55,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:29:11 2015 UTC,Simon has nothing right now. Everything hit pretty hard.
whitesox,38xk8x,MustacheMark,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:29:44 2015 UTC,And my bad lol

whitesox,38xk8x,ricker182,2,Sun Jun 7 18:31:57 2015 UTC,Every ball hit hard.
whitesox,38xk8x,warhawkguy,2,Sun Jun 7 18:32:43 2015 UTC,Abreu is going to hit a HR in his next AB.
whitesox,38xk8x,ricker182,2,Sun Jun 7 18:59:55 2015 UTC,Simon is leaving everything up and we haven't fully taken advantage.
whitesox,38xk8x,AnniesBoobzz,2,Sun Jun 7 19:00:35 2015 UTC,"Good game so far, that HR just kept carrying.   Let's Go Sox!"
whitesox,38xk8x,bababooey55,2,Sun Jun 7 19:07:49 2015 UTC,What a weird half inning.
whitesox,38xk8x,lockwood243,2,Sun Jun 7 19:15:20 2015 UTC,Gotta love running yourself out of an inning. Why is this base running coach still employed?
whitesox,38xk8x,AnniesBoobzz,2,Sun Jun 7 19:35:08 2015 UTC,Absolutely blows my mind. It's like he's purposely sabotaging the team.
whitesox,38xk8x,ricker182,1 point,Sun Jun 7 19:37:32 2015 UTC,"I don't mind sending Sanchez. Soto's mistake was inexcusable. But with Sanchez stealing, you either get a runner on second with two outs or the top of the order leading off the next inning."
whitesox,38xk8x,reekorse,1 point,Sun Jun 7 19:40:07 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I don't mind sending him. The problem I have is that he was out by three steps. That's getting a terrible jump. Both Sanchez's and Coleman's fault."
whitesox,38xk8x,ricker182,2,Sun Jun 7 19:49:06 2015 UTC,That slide too.... Oy vey!
whitesox,38xk8x,doyouevenIift,2,Sun Jun 7 19:52:02 2015 UTC,Seriously fuck Samardzija.
whitesox,38xk8x,doyouevenIift,2,Sun Jun 7 19:54:03 2015 UTC,Fly ball pitcher. In a hitters ball park. On a lively day. I'm not surprised.
whitesox,38xk8x,Cheeky_buggah,2,Sun Jun 7 19:54:09 2015 UTC,If we lose this one I don't see us getting back to .500 again this year.
whitesox,38xk8x,ricker182,2,Sun Jun 7 20:12:30 2015 UTC,Another fantastic inning for the Sox offense
whitesox,38xk8x,MustacheMark,2,Sun Jun 7 20:17:32 2015 UTC,Look at the fight in our guys! 3 strikeouts
whitesox,38xk8x,bababooey55,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:18:00 2015 UTC,NICE TRY!
whitesox,38xk8x,ricker182,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:18:25 2015 UTC,Classic first inning.
whitesox,38xk8x,ricker182,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:25:09 2015 UTC,The Smardzija shit just writes itself. K's the first two batters with ease... but have to get that first inning run!
whitesox,38xk8x,SchpartyOn,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:30:02 2015 UTC,Simon has nothing right now.
whitesox,38xk8x,ricker182,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:30:33 2015 UTC,Throws 85 that splits the fucking plate down the middle. Lol.
whitesox,38xk8x,SchpartyOn,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:31:16 2015 UTC,"Hey guys, Tigers fan here! I just noticed the way that Soto throws the ball back to the pitcher. Is there any reason for the way he does it?  Edit: Soto not Flowers"
whitesox,38xk8x,bababooey55,2,Sun Jun 7 19:00:24 2015 UTC,That's Soto. He says superstition. I think he just has trouble being accurate.
whitesox,38xk8x,ricker182,2,Sun Jun 7 19:03:11 2015 UTC,"It's so strange. He looks like a little kid who just started playing catcher, like a full body heave."
whitesox,38xk8x,ricker182,2,Sun Jun 7 19:07:19 2015 UTC,"Been watching it all year and it still catches me off guard. It's just what he does I guess, not really a for sure explanation (although he says superstition/habit)."
whitesox,38xk8x,ricker182,1 point,Sun Jun 7 19:08:41 2015 UTC,LOL. WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT?!
whitesox,38xk8x,Cheeky_buggah,1 point,Sun Jun 7 19:13:21 2015 UTC,He didn't slip. He just tripped.
whitesox,38xk8x,ricker182,1 point,Sun Jun 7 19:13:52 2015 UTC,Hawk is on top of it. He's still got his mind.
whitesox,38xk8x,Bryan_FUCKIN_bickell,1 point,Sun Jun 7 19:16:59 2015 UTC,"What the hell is with those slides into 2nd. Avi had another one, I swear to God this is the worst fundamentally skilled baseball team"
whitesox,38xk8x,ricker182,2,Sun Jun 7 19:28:16 2015 UTC,That Soto slide was fucking awful too. We don't practice.
whitesox,38xk8x,bababooey55,1 point,Sun Jun 7 19:28:49 2015 UTC,Great way to run ourselves out of the inning
whitesox,38xk8x,ricker182,1 point,Sun Jun 7 19:28:38 2015 UTC,This game has been full of bad baseball. Really hard to watch.
whitesox,38xk8x,ricker182,1 point,Sun Jun 7 19:29:43 2015 UTC,"Out of our AL worst -54 run differential, 27 of those runs have been in the first inning. lol."

whitesox,38xk8x,ricker182,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:21:23 2015 UTC,I'm slowly learning this as the season continues.  There have been a couple starts where it looks like he can pitch at least.
whitesox,38xk8x,Cheeky_buggah,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:23:27 2015 UTC,He's had what 2 good starts? All others he looks great then just implodes all over himself giving up like 6 or 7 runs.
whitesox,38xk8x,Cheeky_buggah,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:25:23 2015 UTC,I think it's funny Robin left Samardzija in so long. I don't get it. It was obvious he was done last inning.

whitesox,38y3gr,ricker182,5,Sun Jun 7 20:53:00 2015 UTC,"We just couldn't hold on to this one. Nothing makes me happier than beating the Tigers, especially kicking the while they're down. But of course we revive the struggling team. Maybe we can get cooking against the Astros. Only thing I can hope for at this point."
whitesox,38y3gr,AnDEErew,3,Sun Jun 7 20:51:48 2015 UTC,And we probably just sparked a Tigers winning streak.
whitesox,38y3gr,ricker182,2,Sun Jun 7 20:55:25 2015 UTC,"Yep, sadly you're probably right. Time will tell. Of course winning a series against us isn't exactly a résumé builder at this point."

whitesox,38y3gr,Georgie56,2,Sun Jun 7 23:10:29 2015 UTC,Getting sick of Hahn telling the public not to panic anymore. Samardzija and an entire load of players have to be traded at this point and we should be looking for a new manager by now.

whitesox,38ue65,magooster,2,Sun Jun 7 01:05:49 2015 UTC,So this is the Danks we get tonight
whitesox,38ue65,PigFarmington,2,Sun Jun 7 01:09:56 2015 UTC,It was really only 1 bad inning. Unfortunate because he was doing really well until the 5th.
whitesox,38ue65,dhcrazy333,3,Sun Jun 7 01:10:31 2015 UTC,It seems like that's usually how Danks rolls.
whitesox,38ue65,PigFarmington,2,Sun Jun 7 01:20:25 2015 UTC,Fox announcers are terrible. Developing story for 7 strike outs?
whitesox,38ue65,heavykevy1983,1 point,Sun Jun 7 01:20:36 2015 UTC,Especially against such an awful offense. I feel like this happens to us weekly.
whitesox,38ue65,bababooey55,1 point,Sun Jun 7 01:30:22 2015 UTC,Iglesias' defense is just too much.

whitesox,38ue65,Slooper1140,1 point,Sun Jun 7 01:49:11 2015 UTC,They think it's a travesty that Hawk hasn't won the Ford C Frick...
whitesox,38sxnf,mrseanbones,13,Sat Jun 6 15:24:54 2015 UTC,I personally would think that Jake Arrieta should be up there before Jason Hammel. That is about the only thing I would change and I think Robertson should be close to this list.
whitesox,38sxnf,DomCaboose,5,Sat Jun 6 15:59:20 2015 UTC,Agreed. Arietta is amazing.
whitesox,38sxnf,Mrslinger85,-2,Sat Jun 6 17:17:36 2015 UTC,Robertson blew 2 saves last week eek. Don't follow the cubs enough but I saw Jake Arrieta's curveball the other day. Filthy.
whitesox,38sxnf,DomCaboose,3,Sun Jun 7 00:48:26 2015 UTC,"I know he did, but look at every closer or closer to be.  They all blow games.  Have you watched Robertson at all though and his stuff?"
whitesox,38sxnf,jlrc2,-1,Sun Jun 7 03:09:05 2015 UTC,Yeah and when he was with the Orioles he was filthy too. It's hard to put any of the new white sox additions in this list because none of them have completely lived up to expectations yet this year. I see your argument though.
whitesox,38sxnf,whitesox20051,13,Sun Jun 7 11:28:19 2015 UTC,"Rizzo at this point is better than Abreu. Healthier, younger, more productive, and versatile. I don't like it, but that's how it is. I wouldn't bet on Kris Bryant reaching the top of the list, especially in terms of topping Sale. He still has a very high K rate and is very unlikely to be more than an adequate defender, if he can reach/stay at that level.   Avi's defense is so bad that I hesitate to list him too highly here. Quintana is better than Hammel, Arrieta may be better than both of them. He hasn't earned it yet, but here's hoping Rodon gets himself on this list by the end of the year."
whitesox,38sxnf,Jadey13,1 point,Sat Jun 6 16:11:03 2015 UTC,Always like the discussion of who would be All-Stars as of right now. I would pick Sale and Garcia
whitesox,38sxnf,ACSimeon,2,Sun Jun 7 12:21:51 2015 UTC,"No White Sox player is currently in the top 5 voting (or top 15 for outfielders). Of course, the pitching staff is picked by the manager and you would expect Sale to get the nod for an appearance during the game if he keeps up this performance he has had of late."
whitesox,38sxnf,BBS-,0,Sun Jun 7 17:27:34 2015 UTC,"I'd put Arrieta on instead of Garcia.  I'd change the order a bit too - Rizzo ahead of Abreu, Arrieta @ 4 and bump Bryant and Hammel down.    I'd have Quintana, Lester and Robertson ahead of Garcia.  Maybe even Fowler."
whitesox,38sxnf,chocoholicsoxfan,1 point,Sat Jun 6 22:50:15 2015 UTC,DAVID ROBERTSON! CARLOS RODON!
whitesox,38sxnf,mythofdob,-1,Sat Jun 6 19:46:37 2015 UTC,Hammel does not belong with these other players.
whitesox,38sxnf,chocoholicsoxfan,1 point,Sat Jun 6 17:00:28 2015 UTC,Hammel is leading the Cubs in like every traditional pitching metric.
whitesox,38sxnf,whitesoxman77,-6,Sun Jun 7 03:53:28 2015 UTC,"I would separate pitchers and position players, but my top five in each are  1 Rizzo 2 Abreu 3 Bryant 4 Castro 5 Melky  And pitchers  1 Sale 2 Lester 3 Robertson 4 Hammel 5 Arrieta"
whitesox,38sxnf,chocoholicsoxfan,7,Sat Jun 6 16:18:42 2015 UTC,"Have you been watching this season at all? Melky and Lester don't belong anywhere near where you've put them.  Hell, Quintana is better than Lester. He's actually one of the top 30 pitchers in the MLB."
whitesox,38sxnf,whitesoxman77,5,Sat Jun 6 17:07:48 2015 UTC,Melky has been a huge disappointment

whitesox,38sxnf,chocoholicsoxfan,-1,Sun Jun 7 03:34:31 2015 UTC,Lol Quintana hasn't been good this year. Lester had a terrible start and his ERA is still almost a full point ahead of Quintana's.  I know ERA isn't everything but Lester is better in most advanced stats as well

I believe the premium tickets are Scout seats, suites, and Home Plate Club.  I'm not sure if it applies to the Stadium Club."

whitesox,38qwij,JROremus,4,Sat Jun 6 13:49:19 2015 UTC,"When Hawk is happy he isn't too bad, but the last few years have really made him unbearable at times. The dead air, cutting off Stone, yelling at umpires... it all gets very unprofessional and annoying after a while.  I don't hate Hawk, but he doesn't add anything to the broadcast for me anymore, and I think a lot of people feel the same."
whitesox,38qwij,Mrslinger85,5,Sat Jun 6 05:25:21 2015 UTC,Completely agree with you. Hawk is unbearable during bad games. And i also get sick of him cutting off Stone.

An old man going off on the umps and telling historical stories is more entertaining to me than a monotone robot reading stats off of a stat sheet. Hawk is a unique mind, and Sox fans should cherish it because it won't be around for much longer."
whitesox,38qwij,dhcrazy333,4,Sat Jun 6 17:25:18 2015 UTC,I care? Others people care? It's almost as if different people have different preferences and that one can have a unique mind and still be outdated and annoying to some.
whitesox,38qwij,whitesox20051,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:41:53 2015 UTC,We are the minority because they can't realize that Hawk is a legend who should be in the broadcasters HOF already. There's no doubt in my mind that I will be using Hawkism's as part of my vocabulary until I am dead.
whitesox,38qwij,Shine_On_Your_Chevy,3,Sat Jun 6 08:37:31 2015 UTC,"I was watching part of the game yesterday and saw Laroche hit a fly ball into left center. Swirsky got all excited with the most excitement i've seen from him saying ""ball well hit to left center field!""   It was an easy fly ball out.  Yeah had a bit of a run to track it down, but made the catch easy.  He's just not made for baseball, he hasn't had enough experience in the field to know not to get excited for things like that.  The questions to Stone are fine, but anybody can ask those questions.  I miss Hawk's passion.  I understand you can either love or hate Hawk, but I personally like his voice for the games and also love his passion for the team.  You don't see that with as many announcers anymore, Swirsky just seems too bland."
whitesox,38qwij,greenrose2,2,Sat Jun 6 15:52:34 2015 UTC,I miss Hawk but also have enjoyed the chemistry between Stone and Swirsky. Hawk would benefit from having someone like DJ or Paciorek who laughs at all of his jokes. Aaron Rowand wasn't bad either with Hawk during that Oakland series

whitesox,38qwij,greenrose2,5,Sat Jun 6 03:27:24 2015 UTC,I'd rather hear Chuck kissing Stone's ass than the dead air that often arises between Hawk and Stone.

whitesox,38qiou,bababooey55,2,Sat Jun 6 02:11:39 2015 UTC,"Nah we'll just pick up another red-haired, left handed, ""power hitting"", lefty from the Nationals."
whitesox,38qiou,samlincoln,1 point,Sat Jun 6 02:23:22 2015 UTC,That's a good point. I'd kill to have a guy like Schwarber but he was 5th.
whitesox,38qiou,samlincoln,3,Sat Jun 6 02:30:23 2015 UTC,"Nice bunt by Carlos, he does the little things right I hope his bat improves just a little bit."
whitesox,38qiou,chocoholicsoxfan,3,Sat Jun 6 02:26:33 2015 UTC,"So not only is Q strapped with the no decision, but the LOSS!  This is getting outright ridiculous.   Edit: I should curse this team more often.  HELL YES ADAM!!!!!!"

whitesox,38qiou,rps215,3,Sat Jun 6 02:50:32 2015 UTC,Just when the Tigers pen starts to look good... lol. Clutch homer though by LaRoche
whitesox,38qiou,TheCity95,3,Sat Jun 6 02:47:26 2015 UTC,Extra innings for the second straight night!
whitesox,38qiou,chocoholicsoxfan,3,Sat Jun 6 02:48:30 2015 UTC,Freeee baseball!  THIS NECESSITATES CAPS LOCK!
whitesox,38qiou,samlincoln,3,Sat Jun 6 02:48:33 2015 UTC,"That wall can be deceptive on players. That padding overhangs more than it looks. You see a lot of away players get caught on it, while our players (eg melky, who plays solid defense and robbed one off the top of the wall earlier this year) know how to play it. Eaton robbed some homers last year. But sometimes what happened to Davis happens to players that aren't familiar. It's a nice home field advantage."
whitesox,38qiou,polishprince76,3,Sat Jun 6 02:49:00 2015 UTC,This Tigers pitcher looks just like Chris Pratt
whitesox,38qiou,samlincoln,3,Sat Jun 6 02:54:37 2015 UTC,Bullpen looking fabulous tonight.
whitesox,38qiou,callmeroo,1 point,Sat Jun 6 02:58:10 2015 UTC,lol probably cause Poopoo Jennings didn't pitch

whitesox,38qiou,fosho17,2,Sat Jun 6 03:20:33 2015 UTC,Does Ramirez always bat second?
whitesox,38qiou,samlincoln,3,Sat Jun 6 03:22:04 2015 UTC,Probably the first time this year he has. Melky Cabrera usually does.
whitesox,38qiou,fosho17,2,Sat Jun 6 00:04:28 2015 UTC,That's what I thought. You usually see Beckham and Ramirez batting one after the other.  Fingers crossed for this change!
whitesox,38qiou,samlincoln,2,Sat Jun 6 00:07:30 2015 UTC,"Q needs to throw a fucking gem to beat the rookie, soft tossing, lefty."
whitesox,38qiou,bababooey55,2,Sat Jun 6 00:26:28 2015 UTC,Q gave up a whole run. No way he gets a win now.
whitesox,38qiou,samlincoln,2,Sat Jun 6 01:04:18 2015 UTC,"This offense sucks and I'm starting to make some (small) money off of it playing daily fantasy. Ryan was the dirt cheapest player and he already hit value barring a meltdown, ofc we can't hit rookie soft tossing lefties.   EDIT: I'd still rather win this game than 10 bucks"
whitesox,38qiou,heavykevy1983,2,Sat Jun 6 01:10:27 2015 UTC,Thanks Comcast for giving us Cubs announcers there.

whitesox,38qiou,AnDEErew,2,Sat Jun 6 01:26:10 2015 UTC,Tigers have given up 44 runs over the last 7 games. Why am I not surprised we have 1 through 6...

whitesox,38qiou,Slooper1140,2,Sat Jun 6 02:07:01 2015 UTC,PLEASE baseball gods. A base hit is all I'm asking.
whitesox,38qiou,rps215,2,Sat Jun 6 02:22:43 2015 UTC,Good god this is a long 8th inning
whitesox,38qiou,magooster,2,Sat Jun 6 02:26:24 2015 UTC,Score some goddamn runs you bums.
whitesox,38qiou,WhiteRabbit13,2,Sat Jun 6 02:28:29 2015 UTC,so this game just came on after the cubs game so I'm watching a bit. Is Hawk gone? Because the broadcast is very well done with Stone and whoever the other guy is.
whitesox,38qiou,bababooey55,3,Sat Jun 6 02:34:53 2015 UTC,"Bulls radio guy, he's done pretty well filling in. Hawk will be back on Sunday I think, he's been out for over a week with surgery."
whitesox,38qiou,WhiteRabbit13,2,Sat Jun 6 02:39:17 2015 UTC,Really enjoying it. I had forgot how good Stone is.
whitesox,38qiou,bababooey55,4,Sat Jun 6 02:41:07 2015 UTC,Chuck has really brought out a lot in Stoney. So much baseball knowledge. Don't think I'd like him as a permanent replacement for Hawk but it's a nice change of pace.
whitesox,38qiou,loulevin19,2,Sat Jun 6 02:43:04 2015 UTC,"Wow. Look at that pitching. Let's just end it here! Q puts out a high quality start, followed by Jennings striking out the side and Roberston striking out the side. We have the pitching, now connect on the hitting!"

whitesox,38qiou,bababooey55,2,Sat Jun 6 02:48:47 2015 UTC,"He's an absolute stud. That trade worked out really well for us and the Tigers, didn't hurt the Red Sox either."
whitesox,38qiou,Slooper1140,2,Sat Jun 6 03:02:03 2015 UTC,Top of the lineup. Let's go boys!
whitesox,38qiou,samlincoln,2,Sat Jun 6 03:03:56 2015 UTC,"That could be Miggy's first error of the year.   EDIT: I actually agree with Swirsky, that's an error. Superstar ruling for ya."

whitesox,38qiou,samlincoln,2,Sat Jun 6 03:22:01 2015 UTC,When Alexei is on he drives the ball back up the middle. It's how he lead our miserable team in BA in 2013. Great move by Robin to shake up the lineup we might score more than 3 runs today.
whitesox,38qiou,Slooper1140,1 point,Sat Jun 6 03:17:45 2015 UTC,Only took us 11 innings to do it

whitesox,38mgyg,WSOXFAN22,5,Fri Jun 5 04:11:21 2015 UTC,"While it doesn't look as dramatic as your post implies. I, for one, agree with what you're saying.  I also think Robin has put himself in this position.  He's gonna have all of his managerial decisions under a microscope because of all this shitty managing that has already gone on this season. It's only June! How many of these threads do we have already. Mercy!"
whitesox,38mgyg,kingbears,10,Fri Jun 5 08:10:11 2015 UTC,This season? Try his entire tenure. He hasn't learned.
whitesox,38mgyg,whitesox20051,6,Fri Jun 5 12:05:46 2015 UTC,That is why he needs to be fired. He still hasn't learned from his mistakes after all these years.
whitesox,38mgyg,this1,3,Fri Jun 5 14:35:20 2015 UTC,"Fired? He should have never been hired. He's a highschool ball coach who was brought into to coach in the bigs, the fuck is this shit? D2 the Might Ducks?"

whitesox,38mgyg,PatrickBateman1,2,Fri Jun 5 18:06:54 2015 UTC,At the beginning of the year I remembered a lot of us being excited about the idea of Jennings-Duke-Robertson to close games out in the 7th-9th... I'm guessing Robin was thinking along those lines too.  However... I think most of us have picked up that Jennings is not the mid-reliever we were hoping for. If we go back and look at his older numbers that can verify this. So why the fuck Robin insists on trotting him out there all the time to face multiple batters is absolutely beyond me.  Just another reason Robin needs to go.
whitesox,38mgyg,JBProds,2,Fri Jun 5 15:25:20 2015 UTC,I didn't think much of the Jennings trade although I did feel that he'd be more valuable than Rienzo as the bullpen needed a left-handed reliever. I was thinking having Petricka & Putnam pitch with Duke before Robertson would be solid.
whitesox,38mgyg,ACSimeon,2,Fri Jun 5 17:12:54 2015 UTC,"The thing about this, is that I would want Ventura to defer to Don Cooper with these kinds of decisions. At this point, it's painfully obvious that Jennings is going to struggle against Lefty batters. So I'm not even sure... what's really happening here?"

whitesox,38la47,Kknowledge,5,Fri Jun 5 03:43:24 2015 UTC,"This is all gut, but i feel like we end up with surprising rallies in games like this. I'm at the game and I'm feeling good. Hopefully I won't leave shame-faced. Go Sox!"
whitesox,38la47,ricker182,4,Fri Jun 5 02:13:48 2015 UTC,Pathetic at the plate tonight. If the opposing team has 4 errors there is no way you should lose.
whitesox,38la47,bababooey55,2,Fri Jun 5 02:33:44 2015 UTC,I agree 100%. 1 run when they have 4 errors? Ridiculous!
whitesox,38la47,bababooey55,2,Fri Jun 5 04:04:21 2015 UTC,Robin gets a smiley face sticker on the board in the clubhouse!
whitesox,38la47,bababooey55,3,Fri Jun 5 04:04:51 2015 UTC,Atta boy Bacon!
whitesox,38la47,samlincoln,2,Fri Jun 5 01:19:05 2015 UTC,"Well he did leave the team for a while and he's sort of playing a new role on the team, but yeah I would say so."
whitesox,38la47,Cheeky_buggah,3,Fri Jun 5 01:20:26 2015 UTC,"""In basketball if the ball goes into the crowd you have to give it back."" Alright Swirsky"
whitesox,38la47,Patron_St_of_Liars,3,Fri Jun 5 01:25:33 2015 UTC,"Rodon has 10Ks, he is lighting it up tonight. Let's get hyped about something this year"
whitesox,38la47,bababooey55,3,Fri Jun 5 01:27:23 2015 UTC,"Reeeeeallly wanted y'all to throw to the Prince of Texas. smart walk, though. he's a liability on the basepad and white hot."
whitesox,38la47,Patron_St_of_Liars,3,Fri Jun 5 01:38:30 2015 UTC,Nah we didn't want any of that lol.
whitesox,38la47,bababooey55,2,Fri Jun 5 01:35:34 2015 UTC,"haha. Mooreland has almost the same average against lefties as righties, though he doesn't drive the ball nearly as well against the former, and he strikes out more."
whitesox,38la47,pohodo3,3,Fri Jun 5 01:53:00 2015 UTC,Ugh. Rodon seems to be getting the Quintana treatment.  Edit - DP woohoo!
whitesox,38la47,samlincoln,3,Fri Jun 5 02:47:02 2015 UTC,Fuck yeah
whitesox,38la47,bababooey55,3,Fri Jun 5 02:50:06 2015 UTC,"My whole building probably heard me ""HEYESS"" after that one."
whitesox,38la47,bababooey55,3,Fri Jun 5 02:51:52 2015 UTC,YES! RACK EM UP!!
whitesox,38la47,pohodo3,3,Fri Jun 5 03:11:19 2015 UTC,Wow. I'll take those calls.
whitesox,38la47,bababooey55,3,Fri Jun 5 03:12:19 2015 UTC,I think that last one was actually a strike
whitesox,38la47,Patron_St_of_Liars,2,Fri Jun 5 03:12:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah after looking at the replay it was, but I'd still be going crazy if I were a Rangers fan."
whitesox,38la47,bababooey55,3,Fri Jun 5 03:12:39 2015 UTC,"BOOOOOOOOOOOOO! smart decision to walk the Italian Stallion, but BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!"
whitesox,38la47,phi1021,3,Fri Jun 5 03:32:28 2015 UTC,I would be incredibly frustrated tonight if I were a Rangers fan.
whitesox,38la47,pohodo3,3,Fri Jun 5 03:33:18 2015 UTC,"Oh trust me... We are, great game though!"
whitesox,38la47,bababooey55,3,Fri Jun 5 03:35:07 2015 UTC,Warriors win
whitesox,38la47,ricker182,3,Fri Jun 5 03:44:33 2015 UTC,I gotta sleep soon come on guys
whitesox,38la47,ricker182,3,Fri Jun 5 03:48:07 2015 UTC,"I fucking love baseball. Outside of the ""hold me back, bro"" fights.    I wish the Sox could be good again.    Someday. Someday."
whitesox,38la47,NineduceXII,2,Fri Jun 5 03:54:30 2015 UTC,I'm not convinced.
whitesox,38la47,samlincoln,3,Fri Jun 5 03:51:46 2015 UTC,Jennings and his near 8 era
whitesox,38la47,bababooey55,3,Fri Jun 5 03:55:55 2015 UTC,I was so high on him after his good start. Now it looks like he could give way to guys coming off the DL and end up in Charlotte.
whitesox,38la47,callmeroo,2,Fri Jun 5 03:57:00 2015 UTC,"Same here, I think a lot of us were. I'll bet he gets sent down pretty soon."
whitesox,38la47,ricker182,3,Fri Jun 5 04:00:37 2015 UTC,"Dan ""Poopoo"" Jennings"
whitesox,38la47,bababooey55,3,Fri Jun 5 04:01:17 2015 UTC,FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCCCCCCCCCCCCKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK    Edit:   Fuck
whitesox,38la47,ricker182,3,Fri Jun 5 03:58:34 2015 UTC,Jennings......
whitesox,38la47,NineduceXII,4,Fri Jun 5 04:01:05 2015 UTC,I mean those were both slow rollers through the infield. Nobody could hit tonight.
whitesox,38la47,bababooey55,3,Fri Jun 5 04:06:06 2015 UTC,Here comes more shit from all my Texas fan family.
whitesox,38la47,ricker182,3,Fri Jun 5 04:03:30 2015 UTC,Weak shit.
whitesox,38la47,NineduceXII,3,Fri Jun 5 04:03:38 2015 UTC,It's fun watching Detroit crash though...
whitesox,38la47,ricker182,3,Fri Jun 5 04:03:40 2015 UTC,What do they have to worry about though? We can't win any games to catch up.
whitesox,38la47,NineduceXII,2,Fri Jun 5 04:04:20 2015 UTC,Them not winning the division is always nice.    Then again my dislike for the Royals is growing and I've always disliked the Twins.
whitesox,38la47,ricker182,2,Fri Jun 5 04:04:26 2015 UTC,"I've always hated KC, Detroit, Twins, and Cleveland. I'm starting to hate my own team now too. Not really but I'm very frustrated."
whitesox,38la47,NineduceXII,2,Fri Jun 5 04:04:44 2015 UTC,It's Cleveland's turn to win the division then not win the WS.    Then we're up.
whitesox,38la47,callmeroo,2,Fri Jun 5 04:05:40 2015 UTC,Except we will win because we know how to.

whitesox,38la47,JBProds,2,Fri Jun 5 04:09:52 2015 UTC,"Great start, haven't seen him hustle like that before"
whitesox,38la47,Cheeky_buggah,1 point,Fri Jun 5 04:12:03 2015 UTC,Great to see him hustle to get into scoring position for the meat of the order.
whitesox,38la47,samlincoln,2,Fri Jun 5 04:17:18 2015 UTC,"Looks like LaRoche gave it all he has and it still didn't go out, where did our teams power go?"
whitesox,38la47,Cheeky_buggah,1 point,Thu Jun 4 23:55:02 2015 UTC,This inning does look promising for the offense though. Seeing a lot of pitches.
whitesox,38la47,bababooey55,2,Fri Jun 5 00:01:33 2015 UTC,"Can't be upset with that inning, got some well hit balls caught"
whitesox,38la47,dhcrazy333,2,Fri Jun 5 00:08:10 2015 UTC,"I do really like the questions Chuck asks Stoney. Even simple questions like ""how much is a bat now?"" brings up some good info and conversation."
whitesox,38la47,bababooey55,3,Fri Jun 5 00:11:57 2015 UTC,"I agree, but at the same time, anybody can ask those questions.  I feel Swirsky is too bland as an announcer and his voice just doesn't fit a baseball game."
whitesox,38la47,samlincoln,2,Fri Jun 5 00:16:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah I certainly agree, which is why I welcome it, but only for a little while. I like Chuck but wouldn't want him long term."
whitesox,38la47,waff1ez,3,Fri Jun 5 00:15:54 2015 UTC,And the Tigers are in freefall.
whitesox,38la47,bababooey55,2,Fri Jun 5 00:19:16 2015 UTC,Lets talk about that on Monday
whitesox,38la47,dhcrazy333,2,Fri Jun 5 00:24:34 2015 UTC,Avi really struggling after coming back. Just make contact Avi!
whitesox,38la47,Patron_St_of_Liars,2,Fri Jun 5 01:31:14 2015 UTC,Let's get a run here and get Rodon a win. He deserves it.
whitesox,38la47,Cheeky_buggah,2,Fri Jun 5 01:39:00 2015 UTC,"So, did Rodon have a particularly good night, or is he Sale 2.0. I know he's prone to walks, but that's all I've heard in the way of a scouting report. Is he always hell on lefties?"
whitesox,38la47,Patron_St_of_Liars,4,Fri Jun 5 01:39:49 2015 UTC,"I think each game you can see improvement from him. He looks more confident on the hill, is walking less guys, striking them out. I think he's legit"
whitesox,38la47,Cheeky_buggah,3,Fri Jun 5 01:31:49 2015 UTC,Right on! he made our guys (including Choo who has been stout of late) look foolish at times. I love a good pitching duel. How'd you like Yovanni's ridiculous Rat tail and Ludicrous beard?
whitesox,38la47,bababooey55,3,Fri Jun 5 01:37:11 2015 UTC,He should grow them so long that you can tie them together!
whitesox,38la47,samlincoln,2,Fri Jun 5 01:55:58 2015 UTC,He's safe. Alexei really tends to call for reviews when he's wrong.
whitesox,38la47,Patron_St_of_Liars,2,Fri Jun 5 01:59:37 2015 UTC,DeShields throwing the leather out there tonight.
whitesox,38la47,ricker182,2,Fri Jun 5 02:16:41 2015 UTC,"He's been a really pleasant surprise this year. The word on him was that he was a waste of a Rule 5 pick, as he had been a failed second baseman with the Astros and was essentially just a pinch runner."
whitesox,38la47,bababooey55,2,Fri Jun 5 02:23:28 2015 UTC,Avi has looked pretty bad in his at bats outside of the walk.
whitesox,38la47,ricker182,1 point,Fri Jun 5 02:26:14 2015 UTC,Very bad. Maybe physical but looks mental as well. He's swinging for the fences again.
whitesox,38la47,ricker182,2,Fri Jun 5 02:28:59 2015 UTC,Gotta play defense too.
whitesox,38la47,bababooey55,2,Fri Jun 5 02:32:51 2015 UTC,Still no clutch.
whitesox,38la47,ricker182,2,Fri Jun 5 02:44:27 2015 UTC,Shiiit
whitesox,38la47,ricker182,2,Fri Jun 5 02:55:11 2015 UTC,WOW!!!!!!!!!!!
whitesox,38la47,Patron_St_of_Liars,2,Fri Jun 5 02:59:06 2015 UTC,I did not think they'd be able to turn two. Great play!
whitesox,38la47,samlincoln,2,Fri Jun 5 02:58:11 2015 UTC,that was a helluva turn. slow. clap.
whitesox,38la47,pohodo3,2,Fri Jun 5 03:03:29 2015 UTC,"Score here, bring in Robertson."
whitesox,38la47,ricker182,2,Fri Jun 5 02:58:52 2015 UTC,Why not pinch hit for Tyler here? Is Soto hurt?
whitesox,38la47,ricker182,2,Fri Jun 5 03:00:02 2015 UTC,"Not much better on the bench, but I agree. Doesn't get worse than Flowe... Nevermind. Forgot about Soto."
whitesox,38la47,bababooey55,2,Fri Jun 5 03:09:43 2015 UTC,That's a strike?!?!?!
whitesox,38la47,ricker182,2,Fri Jun 5 03:11:47 2015 UTC,My thoughts exactly. What the HELL was that?
whitesox,38la47,ricker182,2,Fri Jun 5 03:12:39 2015 UTC,A ball.
whitesox,38la47,bababooey55,2,Fri Jun 5 03:13:45 2015 UTC,Blew our load yesterday... Probably back to scoring 1-2 a game.
whitesox,38la47,ricker182,2,Fri Jun 5 03:13:54 2015 UTC,Jennings. Uh oh.
whitesox,38la47,robinsucksatmanaging,2,Fri Jun 5 03:15:35 2015 UTC,Ugh.... Got a bad feeling about this half inning coming up.
whitesox,38la47,ricker182,2,Fri Jun 5 03:18:37 2015 UTC,"Robin almost lost it with leaving in Webb, now he is with Jennings coming in to face the lefties.(someone posted on lefties are hitting .300 against him, and 3 straight lefties he is due up).  Robin needs to go."
whitesox,38la47,ricker182,3,Fri Jun 5 03:17:06 2015 UTC,That username....
whitesox,38la47,Mrslinger85,2,Fri Jun 5 03:19:04 2015 UTC,Fielder is only thinking HR.
whitesox,38la47,pohodo3,2,Fri Jun 5 03:19:19 2015 UTC,Welp. Lets be sure to tire out the bullpen before losing
whitesox,38la47,ricker182,2,Fri Jun 5 03:17:39 2015 UTC,I remember when baseball use to have home runs
whitesox,38la47,ricker182,2,Fri Jun 5 03:18:28 2015 UTC,Way to go offense.
whitesox,38la47,bababooey55,2,Fri Jun 5 03:24:10 2015 UTC,Webb again???
whitesox,38la47,ricker182,2,Fri Jun 5 03:25:53 2015 UTC,More Webb? Umm. Ok.
whitesox,38la47,bababooey55,2,Fri Jun 5 03:26:55 2015 UTC,Woohoo!!!!!!!!
whitesox,38la47,NineduceXII,2,Fri Jun 5 03:30:28 2015 UTC,Haha wowwwwww!
whitesox,38la47,magooster,2,Fri Jun 5 03:36:44 2015 UTC,"Lol its like the same thing every inning. Someone got on base, got him to 2nd, 1 out and int walk."

whitesox,38la47,GowhiteSox,2,Fri Jun 5 03:47:16 2015 UTC,What would u switch up? Seems every body is struggling
whitesox,38la47,samlincoln,1 point,Fri Jun 5 04:00:33 2015 UTC,"I'd go with what the Mets, Cubs, Blue, etc. do and use whatever that lineup that was on here a couple months ago.   It was something like put your best hitter at 2, second best at four, and third best batting at 5. And then 6-9 the best remaining. Says it didn't matter who batted 1st or 3rd, and that 3rd is actually the least productive.  So he should be batting second, like Bryant, Wright(when he isn't injured), Donaldson...And there were more teams doing this but those were the biggies.  Basically Abreu shouldn't be batting third because he would be more productive 2,4 or 5."
whitesox,38la47,samlincoln,1 point,Fri Jun 5 04:06:49 2015 UTC,That hustle double caught me way off guard. Melky just punked that guy for an error.

whitesox,38la47,samlincoln,1 point,Thu Jun 4 23:44:41 2015 UTC,Get multiple base runners & fail to score a run. Sounds about right.
whitesox,38la47,JBProds,1 point,Fri Jun 5 00:11:12 2015 UTC,Alexei hit that ball pretty well. Better than a 10 pitch 1-2-3 inning.
whitesox,38la47,pohodo3,2,Fri Jun 5 00:12:34 2015 UTC,Not bashing Alexei. He made solid contact. Just stating how things haven't changed for the team. Haven't been getting that clutch hit that other teams seem to get against us.

whitesox,38la47,samlincoln,1 point,Fri Jun 5 00:27:08 2015 UTC,Flowers has seen the ball well his last couple ABs. Alexei is the best base stealing threat on this team.

whitesox,38la47,Patron_St_of_Liars,1 point,Fri Jun 5 01:26:21 2015 UTC,As many HR's as SB's  for Eaton.
whitesox,38la47,bababooey55,1 point,Fri Jun 5 02:21:52 2015 UTC,"Serious question, I saw him yak that ball Tuesday night but know very little about him; is he a potential 30/30 guy?"
whitesox,38la47,samlincoln,3,Fri Jun 5 02:22:43 2015 UTC,"Definitely not. He's more of a scrappy player. 30 stolen bases yes someday, but 30 homers no way."
whitesox,38la47,Patron_St_of_Liars,2,Fri Jun 5 02:24:35 2015 UTC,He apparently shows a lot of power in batting practice but only hit one last year. I'd like him going for base hits instead.
whitesox,38la47,samlincoln,1 point,Fri Jun 5 02:27:29 2015 UTC,The ol' Ichiro motif. I can dig it.
whitesox,38la47,ricker182,2,Fri Jun 5 02:28:37 2015 UTC,Ha I was thinking the same thing.
whitesox,38la47,ricker182,2,Fri Jun 5 02:31:42 2015 UTC,Most definitely no. I'd be surprised if he even had a 30 SB season soon.
whitesox,38la47,bababooey55,1 point,Fri Jun 5 02:28:40 2015 UTC,Ugh. No clutch...
whitesox,38la47,Patron_St_of_Liars,3,Fri Jun 5 02:35:01 2015 UTC,I like Jake. Nothing flashy but he seems to get the job done most of the time. Good guy to have in the pen.
whitesox,38la47,samlincoln,1 point,Fri Jun 5 02:41:28 2015 UTC,I don't know how he throws as hard as he does with that weird wrist action.
whitesox,38la47,ricker182,1 point,Fri Jun 5 02:49:56 2015 UTC,Alright. We have to capitalize.

whitesox,38la47,ricker182,1 point,Fri Jun 5 03:10:24 2015 UTC,Swirsky has a hard time telling where the ball is going to go. Kind of annoying.

whitesox,38fvzv,dhcrazy333,8,Thu Jun 4 01:17:54 2015 UTC,Rangers fan checking in. Super stoked to see Sale do his thing. Greatness regardless of colors their wearing is still greatness.
whitesox,38fvzv,Patron_St_of_Liars,2,Wed Jun 3 23:45:23 2015 UTC,The battles with Gallo are going to be worth the price of admission
whitesox,38fvzv,Cheeky_buggah,4,Thu Jun 4 00:11:41 2015 UTC,Gallo took advantage of bad Samardzija yesterday and a 15 run parade by his team. I expect Sale to make him look like a rookie tonight.
whitesox,38fvzv,samlincoln,2,Thu Jun 4 00:28:01 2015 UTC,"sigh With his struggles against lefties in AA, me too, me too."
whitesox,38fvzv,Patron_St_of_Liars,2,Thu Jun 4 00:35:52 2015 UTC,Sale makes a lot of hitters look bad. Gallo went from 0-hypebeast in one night (in the eyes of somebody who doesn't follow the Rangers). Whatever he can bring when Beltre is out is a huge positive.   My second sentence may have sounded like shittalk but I really like your team this year. And it's not because of Gallo.
whitesox,38fvzv,samlincoln,2,Thu Jun 4 00:56:30 2015 UTC,"not at all, man! no worries. Gallo might be something really special. but there's a reason he's headed to Roundrock (AAA) once Belts is back. He has a lot of development to do. You might remember Chris Davis having similar hype when he was in our minor league system, then going on to set the MLB record for Ks, and not as a pitcher. Management is trying to avoid Davis 2.0 by taking their time with Gallo. Now, Davis was not the hitter nor athlete Gallo is, but you get my point."
whitesox,38fvzv,Patron_St_of_Liars,3,Thu Jun 4 01:02:55 2015 UTC,"He turned out pretty well though, right? Didn't he lead the league in HRs 2 years ago? Do u wish u guys had stuck with him"
whitesox,38fvzv,Cheeky_buggah,2,Thu Jun 4 01:31:48 2015 UTC,"He did, and that's what I'm getting at. He struggled something fierce for 2 seasons with us, and needed a change of venue and team. Thus the attitude with Gallo, not training someone's Chris Davis, but developing him correctly and reaping the benefits ourselves.   I'm fine with letting Davis go. Both for him and the team. Had he panned out, prince wouldn't have come here, we would have tied money up in him and likely missed Yu, Mooreland would have been competitive for someone else, etc."
whitesox,38fvzv,Patron_St_of_Liars,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:35:29 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping so. Gallo struggles against lefties and has plate discipline issues (he walks significantly less than he k's). Either way, I'm watching all 9!"

whitesox,38fvzv,Patron_St_of_Liars,5,Thu Jun 4 01:23:19 2015 UTC,"I know I'm a minority in the sub, but I actually don't really like Swirsky announcing.  He just doesn't seem enthusiastic at all, it just sounds like he's going through the motions. You can tell baseball isn't really his forte.    I do appreciate the Q&A with Stone to get a lot of Stone's baseball insight, but I feel we can get anybody to do that. I also just don't think his voice is good for baseball games.  I don't know. TO each their own. Could be worse."
whitesox,38fvzv,dhcrazy333,4,Thu Jun 4 01:42:28 2015 UTC,"He's a Bulls radio guy. I love the White Sox, but there's no comparing the excitement between the two sports. I've never gone hoarse at a Sox game the way I have at Bulls games. So, I find his relative lack of enthusiasm totally forgivable.  I agree with you about the way he plays a great straight man for Stone."

whitesox,38fvzv,dhcrazy333,4,Thu Jun 4 01:50:05 2015 UTC,"I feel like he has settled in more today and shown some more life, but on the whole I agree."
whitesox,38fvzv,Slooper1140,3,Thu Jun 4 01:50:16 2015 UTC,"I agree. STAND UP DOUBLE. He really cares a lot about guys not sliding. Swirsky aint bad though, just a fill in."
whitesox,38fvzv,samlincoln,2,Thu Jun 4 01:44:02 2015 UTC,"I agree. I don't mind him and welcome the change of pace from Hawk for a game or two, but I would not be interested at all having him stick around. Nothing against him, I like him, just not as an every day Sox broadcaster."
whitesox,38fvzv,bababooey55,1 point,Thu Jun 4 02:03:42 2015 UTC,"I don't really like him, either.  I, also, don't like Stone,  and he just keeps asking him questions. To which Stone keeps blabbing like he is the smartest baseball mind around."

whitesox,38fvzv,samlincoln,3,Thu Jun 4 03:15:21 2015 UTC,Not a single pitch in the zone and Flowers K's with no out and the bases loaded. Can we get a real catcher please?
whitesox,38fvzv,reekorse,2,Thu Jun 4 00:16:43 2015 UTC,"Honestly, his hitting wouldn't bother me as much as it does if he was solid behind the plate, but might be worse at throwing runners out than at hitting."
whitesox,38fvzv,JBProds,2,Thu Jun 4 00:37:38 2015 UTC,"Which players are you targeting if you were Hahn? I think that it's hard to find a good hitting catcher in todays MLB. Flowers has been so bad though. So I'm thinking we give Kottaras a try (hitting .308 in AAA rn). I do remember Phegley hitting .368 in Charlotte when he was called up to remedy flowers suckage, didnt work out.  Another thing, bring back Nieto, if you cant hit at least be able to play defense. Nieto is even athletic enough to pinch run.   This ran a little long, but it's very difficult to find competent hitting catchers in the mlb and a lot of teams have Cs hitting around .220. I wouldn't shell out the cash for an elite catcher but there are solutions in the minors."
whitesox,38fvzv,samlincoln,1 point,Thu Jun 4 00:44:23 2015 UTC,"The only real trade targets I could see are Jonathan Lucroy, Dioner Navarro, and Devin Mesoraco."

whitesox,38fvzv,TheHoneyBadger23,3,Thu Jun 4 02:29:54 2015 UTC,"When he's on, which can be quite often, yes. He's a beast."
whitesox,38fvzv,bababooey55,2,Thu Jun 4 02:30:45 2015 UTC,"a 3 hit shutout against this lineup, even without Belts, Prince and Hamilton is impressive. I'm glad I'm watching this. I said in my first comment ITT that greatness regardless of uniform is greatness nonetheless. I have the weirdest boner watching him right now."
whitesox,38fvzv,Patron_St_of_Liars,2,Thu Jun 4 02:32:19 2015 UTC,Why is Prince not in the lineup tonight? That's kind of bizarre seeing as how he's been so productive and Beltre and Hamilton are out.
whitesox,38fvzv,bababooey55,3,Thu Jun 4 02:39:31 2015 UTC,"Health, mainly. Having Peyton Manning surgery is no joke, and with Gallo doing a short stint and the hope there being he takes a notebook full of things to work on in AAA in a few weeks once Belts is back, give Prince a night off and let the kid struggle against one of baseball's best southpaws.   I'm in no way saying the Rangers weren't trying to win this game, or put themselves in the best position to do so, just saying that they're taking the ""marathon not a sprint"" idea to heart with a hundred million dollar investment in Prince."

whitesox,38fvzv,Patron_St_of_Liars,2,Thu Jun 4 01:43:05 2015 UTC,Not even fair with how Sale is pitching right now. What a joy to watch.
whitesox,38fvzv,bababooey55,2,Thu Jun 4 01:45:07 2015 UTC,I think Alexei got confused on that at-bat and thought there was a runner on first.
whitesox,38fvzv,Slooper1140,2,Thu Jun 4 01:59:12 2015 UTC,Tumbleweed!!
whitesox,38fvzv,CheddarGuevara,2,Thu Jun 4 02:14:56 2015 UTC,This is just silly. Chris is unhittable.
whitesox,38fvzv,bababooey55,2,Thu Jun 4 02:16:31 2015 UTC,this team is so inconsistent
whitesox,38fvzv,gotpez,2,Thu Jun 4 02:19:25 2015 UTC,WOO HOO!  All attention on the Sox now!
whitesox,38fvzv,chocoholicsoxfan,2,Thu Jun 4 02:31:10 2015 UTC,That man was the most frightening thing I've seen all week.
whitesox,38fvzv,chocoholicsoxfan,2,Thu Jun 4 02:49:31 2015 UTC,Dang.  It looks like I missed a good game.  Unfortunately the Hawks trumped the Sox for tonight.  Once the finals are over (hopefully with the Stanley Cup in hand) I'll be able to fully concentrate on the Sox.
whitesox,38fvzv,KJzero9,1 point,Thu Jun 4 02:52:33 2015 UTC,Damnit. Almost 20 pitches no outs.

whitesox,38d7b0,johncocksack,5,Thu Jun 4 00:09:06 2015 UTC,"Our draft is limited to Pitchers only,considering we can't develop a hitter if it meant the world would end."
whitesox,38d7b0,socklessmoejohnson,5,Wed Jun 3 20:00:35 2015 UTC,"Our scouting system really needs a complete overhaul, it's actually fucking embarrassing how few of our prospects pan out."

whitesox,38d7b0,socklessmoejohnson,5,Wed Jun 3 20:52:04 2015 UTC,I know right? How about we just draft players that are good at baseball instead of omg incredible raw athleticism. It's like KW kept drafting versions of himself over and over again in the vain hope that one of them will have a breakout career and atone for his baseball sins.
whitesox,38d7b0,callmeroo,3,Wed Jun 3 21:46:54 2015 UTC,"And no more of these high strikeout, raw power guys who can't even hit .260 in AA."

whitesox,38auga,bababooey55,2,Wed Jun 3 02:42:31 2015 UTC,"The crazy thing is that coming in to today's game, he had only allowed 19 ERs in the 58 other innings he's pitched this season."
whitesox,38auga,PigFarmington,5,Wed Jun 3 03:17:34 2015 UTC,I too have noticed.
whitesox,38auga,ggslovin,4,Wed Jun 3 01:43:27 2015 UTC,"He is bad. Other than Semien, thankfully the Sox didn't give up too much to get him. But it still blows my mind the Cubs got fucking Addison Russell for him."
whitesox,38auga,ACSimeon,2,Wed Jun 3 13:14:38 2015 UTC,Today was not his day.
whitesox,38auga,trutrojan8,3,Wed Jun 3 01:59:42 2015 UTC,"Definitely wasn't his day, but his first innings have been terrible. In 11 starts this season: 11.54 ERA, 23 Hits, 16 Runs, 14 Earned Runs, 3 BB, 3 K."

whitesox,38b5bn,JBProds,4,Wed Jun 3 03:45:09 2015 UTC,The biggest problem to me is minor league coaching/scouting/overall philosophy. We suck at developing hitting talent and it is holding the organization back.
whitesox,38b5bn,JROremus,1 point,Wed Jun 3 05:51:19 2015 UTC,"Manager, hitting/pitching/base coaches, and players."
whitesox,38b5bn,Georgie56,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:46:48 2015 UTC,"Can't disagree with any of that. On a night where the pitching was abysmal, I think the problem with the team is the hitting. No one really sees a lot of pitches besides LaRoche, but that's not what he's getting paid to do. He's not hitting even though he's showing great patience at the plate. This team is also near the bottom in HRs. If they were actually manufacturing runs with walks, singles, just hitting the ball in place, etc. then that wouldn't be a problem."
whitesox,38b5bn,JBProds,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:53:06 2015 UTC,"I'm with you. Jennings isn't a LOOGY. Lefties hit .299 off him a season ago. It doesn't take a genius. I'm someone that feels that fans are way too critical of RV on things that are out if his control, BUT I have always been critical on how terrible he is with handling pitching: leaving pitchers in, putting in one pitcher over another, continuing to use a reliever in the same situation even though they haven't had any success, etc."
whitesox,38b5bn,JBProds,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:44:54 2015 UTC,AKA EXACTLY the same problems Ozzie had. Ozzie infuriated me with his horrible pitching management. And people want him back.  LOL!

whitesox,38b5bn,JBProds,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:36:59 2015 UTC,"I was wrong about this guy. I really liked him early. Jennings job is in jeopardy with Albers, Crain, and Jones recovering. I'd still rather have Jennings than Rienzo though."
whitesox,38aho8,chisoxbot,8,Tue Jun 2 23:10:57 2015 UTC,Does Samardzija ever fucking warm up? This happens almost every start.

whitesox,38aho8,Georgie56,5,Wed Jun 3 00:32:46 2015 UTC,I don't know if I'd call him a bust.  But what I would call him is average and not deserving of Ace money
whitesox,38aho8,TheHoneyBadger23,1 point,Wed Jun 3 00:40:48 2015 UTC,Average with average stuff. That's why Billy Beane was such a fucking dumbass.

whitesox,38aho8,ricker182,1 point,Wed Jun 3 00:32:40 2015 UTC,Both projection systems on Fangraphs have him as an above-average hitter and player RoS. And he's 25 making the major league minimum. Those are the types of players the Sox should be hoarding.

whitesox,38bdvz,SlagginOff,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:31:08 2015 UTC,I wonder what Rocky Wirtz would do with the Sox and Bulls. He's hired a GM who turned the Blackhawks into the envy of the NHL.
whitesox,38bdvz,Georgie56,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:34:29 2015 UTC,"Rocky Wirtz has been a huge success story with 7 straight playoff appearances under his belt since he took over. The White Sox don't even have that many playoff berths in the 34 years Reinsdorf has been owner. They have five. Five postseason appearances since 1981. Yes, they have a World Series championship, but you're delusional if you think that wasn't at least somewhat flukey.   I'd kill for the Sox to become like the Hawks, but it seems like that isn't happening with this current ownership. I'm no Cubs hater, but if only by a small margin, they seem to be in better position to do something of the sort, and in this city, that is not good news for the Sox.   Sigh."
whitesox,38bdvz,SlagginOff,2,Wed Jun 3 03:50:50 2015 UTC,It's important not to compare playoff appearances in MLB and NHL.     It's a lot tougher to make it in MLB. That being said I wish the Sox could emulate the Hawks' success.
whitesox,38bdvz,ricker182,1 point,Wed Jun 3 05:09:03 2015 UTC,"Okay, I agree with you, but there's no excuse for the Sox to have such an abysmal playoff history, 2005 notwithstanding, during Reinsdorf's reign. Especially considering he was a key factor in the 94 strike, a season that saw the Sox as pennant contenders. The white flag trade in 97 is another strike against him. I don't hate him, in fact I love him for the Bulls' threepeats in the 90s, but I think his time with the Sox should be over."

whitesox,385huz,whitesox20051,1 point,Tue Jun 2 00:14:17 2015 UTC,Small sample sizes but LaRoche is hitting .333/.450/.848 this year as a 1B vs .203/.338/.268 as a DH.  Abreu is hitting .283/.343/.474 as a 1B and a marginally better .276/.323/.517 as a DH.  What with the team struggles doesn't Ventura think it might be worth playing Adam at 1st more often? If it proves to be an anomaly then fuck it go back to the status quo but it seems stupid to not try swapping the two. Keep the batting order the same but 1B LaRoche.

whitesox,3852mw,JBProds,3,Mon Jun 1 22:28:51 2015 UTC,"Anybody but another lefty starter. I don't think the Sox rotation can handle it haha. If a catcher that has extreme potential is available at that spot, I would take him"
whitesox,3852mw,whitesox20051,3,Tue Jun 2 00:18:47 2015 UTC,"The catching is relatively weak in this draft like most years. Taylor Stephenson & Chris Betts are the top two catchers, but they're high schoolers. I also prefer a RHP, but the White Sox have been in connection with Jay since the beginning of the season. If he's s good as advertised then I wouldn't be mad at a rotation featuring four lefties. Take a look. Scouts say he reminds them of Sale, but are not sure if he can be as dominant which is a fair assessment as not many would anyways. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1A8ua9iS98"
whitesox,3852mw,whitesox20051,1 point,Tue Jun 2 00:33:41 2015 UTC,"Makes sense a rotation of: Sale, Quintana, Rodon, and Jay would be extremely appealing but is it too lefty dominated. I've started to stray away from the argument of balance in a rotation between lefties and righties. Still though, I would like some diversity"
whitesox,3852mw,froglegs_jackson,1 point,Tue Jun 2 20:11:41 2015 UTC,"I've been in the front seat of the ""Get more RHP Starters"" bandwagon, but the front office must really like what they've seen and heard from scouts because they're well aware of the lack of a right handed pitcher. When you think about it, the rotation has been doing better as of late & it currently features four lefties. Although, I do believe drafting a RHP would not make the might as desperate to sign Samardzija even though I do feel that it's a must at this point."
whitesox,3852mw,froglegs_jackson,3,Tue Jun 2 20:21:04 2015 UTC,"It sounds like Jay has 1.1 type stuff, but I think he's benefiting a little bit from being an unknown. People are projecting he'll be able to carry his stuff over from the bullpen to starting every 5 days, and that doesn't seem like it should be a guarantee to me. As of now, I'm hoping for Fulmer, though I wouldn't be upset if they went with a position player (if one of the SS slip, or someone like Tyler Stephenson, Daz Cameron, Ian Happ, etc) but that's probably wishful thinking. Unless the top 7 picks are all college SP (which obviously won't happen), I would be shocked if they take anything other than a college SP."
whitesox,3852mw,gubgub35,2,Tue Jun 2 00:06:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your input. I'd love Fulmer, but they say he'll end up in the bullpen due to his high stress delivery. That hasn't scared them in the past though as we've seen them draft Sale, Rodon and Danish. Draft experts (Callis, Manuel, etc.) say the White Sox will draft these players if available in this order: Jay (hometown favorite), Tate, Fulmer and then Jon Harris. They can't see the White Sox passing on a college starter as their next pick won't be until the 3rd round. Only way they don't, like you wrote, if one of those top SS fall. I can't see them drafting OF especially not a high schooler like Cameron. This team has enough outfielders. They have two fairly young OFs in Eaton & Avisail. They'll have Melky for three and then they have Hawkins in AA & Thompson in AAA. Plus, scouts believe Micah Johnson & Tim Anderson will end up in the outfielder instead of the infield."
whitesox,3852mw,midtowntologansquare,4,Tue Jun 2 00:29:06 2015 UTC,"I don't think the White Sox are in a position where they should be drafting for need. If they believe Daz Cameron (hypothetically) is the best player on their board, they should take him. Let the rest sort its self out later. The Cubs draft philosophy since Theo took over seems like an ideal way to handle things, imo."
whitesox,38403b,TheCity95,11,Mon Jun 1 18:14:57 2015 UTC,"I like how interested Chuck was in learning from Stone, and it brought out a whole new person in Stoney. Much more likeable than when he is with Hawk because he hardly ever gets to speak.   Plus Stone opened up and said some things he'd probably never say with Hawk around (Batting Average overrated comment yesterday). Plus, Chuck already has a great radio personality so it just seemed like a natural fit to me.   Overall, I think Chuck has been doing very well. If I can't get a Stoney/Wimpy called game after Hawk is gone, I'd put him in the running! Not that it'll happen, but still. Great job thus far, Chuck!"
whitesox,38403b,AnniesBoobzz,14,Mon Jun 1 23:35:54 2015 UTC,I really enjoyed listening to Chuck call the games. He'd be a good replacement for Hawk.
whitesox,38403b,frankin_berry,2,Mon Jun 1 18:25:43 2015 UTC,"Much better than the Hawk/Stone dynamic. Instead of the usual blathering about how the old time game was much better, we had actual play by play and actual analysis."
whitesox,38403b,ggslovin,4,Tue Jun 2 21:02:45 2015 UTC,I've got to disagree. I'm most annoyed at the delay in calling obvious hits. It feels like he's watched very few baseball games.
whitesox,38403b,rgeyedoc,6,Mon Jun 1 19:39:55 2015 UTC,"I agree he's been a little awkward or uncertain and that probably comes from a lack of experience. But still, he'll get better and I appreciate the energy he brings to the broadcast."
whitesox,38403b,ParkerAdderson,4,Mon Jun 1 20:56:22 2015 UTC,"I'm with this. His timing was behind and you felt the Stone Pony fill in some gaps that shouldn't have been there. But I will say, their rapport was really good, and I enjoyed the twitter Q&A we got to hear from Steve."
whitesox,38403b,ElTunaGrande,2,Mon Jun 1 19:42:46 2015 UTC,"Overall? Meh. I'd rather get Rowand some more seasoning as an announcer (I only was able to catch him announcing one game but I heard he loosened up later on).   Swirsky strikes me as a complete broadcasting mercenary. Good voice, has been around sports, but it seems like his heart really isn't that into baseball (stark contrast from Hawk). Two or three times he brought up basketball and Stone was just giving a one word response and moving on. All of his phrases seem so canned (eg. BIG SWIING AND A MISSS), at least Hawk created his own canned sayings himself and they're kind of original (well not anymore).   Having Swirsky on and his limited experience with baseball has made Stone look like a great baseball mind (which he is). If anything,  it feels like a novice asking a grandmaster questions. Having Swirsky, who knows his place, brings Stone to the forefront and improves the broadcast a lot. The going over different types of pitches was pretty cool.   So overall: I'd say 5.75/10. He is professional, doesn't open his mouth and say stupid things, but doesn't really have anything insightful or good baseball stories. He's really just a fill in."
whitesox,38403b,samlincoln,12,Mon Jun 1 21:01:15 2015 UTC,At this point does Hawk have anything insightful to say or good baseball stories to tell?
whitesox,38403b,Foskey,2,Mon Jun 1 21:15:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah haha good point. At least hawk seems more genuinely interested in the game.  I remember watching that throwback game from 1993 last year and at some point he was a damn good announcer. Hawk did at least play the game, and some of his stories about how players handled their meager finances back in the day and what the game used to be like  are still more interesting than whatever Swirsky is saying/asking."

whitesox,382mn5,heyaboo,10,Mon Jun 1 12:18:24 2015 UTC,"I've posted this before but I mean it fits well here.  It's from game two of the World Series.   This game was really one of the best nights of my life. It took so long to find parking at the game that I was starting to get concerned that I wasn't going to get inside until the second or third inning, but my brother (an admitted brewers fan) and I managed to find our seats just before they started with the anthem.  When Konerko was on deck before the grand slam and the Astros brought in a relief pitcher they started playing living on a prayer, and my brother mentioned how something good always happens when that song is played. The pitcher was finally ready and then everyone waited the extra 2 minutes for what I can only assume was an awesome commercial break.  First pitch grand slam and the entire stadium was shaking. It was so loud and people were jumping up and down high fives everywhere. I was wearing my Konerko jersey and got hugs/high fives from pretty much everyone within 20 feet (I'm assuming beyond that there was another person in a Konereko jersey recieving the same). The inning ends and people were still cheering as I went to use the restroom. I got inside and the line was pretty long but people saw my jersey and just moved out of the way. There were more high fives all the way to the urinal.  Now there is one thing I should note. After this game I was already on the hook for driving my brother to Milwaukee after the game and then driving back to Chicago to the hotel for the night. It wasn't that late in the night when the Astros tied it up in the ninth but it was cold as shit and raining. My brother on the other hand thought it was starting to get far too late since he had tests or something in the morning (I'm sure he told me but screw him this was the world series).  Podsednik came up with two outs and the whole section was prepping for extras. I mean come on the guy had one home run all year and it was two weeks ago lightning can't possibly strike twice. When he hit that ball there was a pure wall of noise. Everyone knew that ball was gone. The fireworks started going off and you could barely hear them.  My brother and I actually got stopped a couple times walking out of the stadium and it was only then that I noticed the jersey I let him borrow for the night. Number 22.  I didn't even really get a chance to sleep that night as I only got back to the hotel around 5am. I had to work nights for both of the next two games recorded game three and watched it when I got home and spent most of game four listening to the shitty work radio before driving home just after the eigth inning.  That night and the whole month was just insane. Growing up as a white sox fan in a family of cubs fans these things just didn't happen. And after having my hopes crushed by the strike I thought there might be a chance it wouldn't. My brother asked me last year if I'd still pay as much as I did for the tickets ... I told him I'd gladly pay double."
whitesox,382mn5,dave8814,2,Mon Jun 1 16:06:54 2015 UTC,Oh man you just gave me goosebumps. I watched the game at home with my wife and 3 month old sleeping upstairs. When Paulie hit that slam I was jumping up and down trying hard not to yell. After Pods walk off I had to step out the front door and yell at the top of my lungs. That was without a doubt the greatest game I will ever watch.
whitesox,382mn5,shockwave123,6,Tue Jun 2 05:13:05 2015 UTC,"In 2005 I was an 18 year old kid working as a package handler for UPS. I work the night shift from 10pm -2am and was scheduled to work the night of Game 4. Considering the white sox waited 88 years for another world series I was not going to miss it for any reason. I called in sick, even though I didn't have any sick time. I ended up losing my job because of it, but looking back it was one of the best decisions I ever made. I never could have lived with myself if I had missed the last out."

We both knew if we lost that game there was a possibility we were making a cross country trip to get swept. That's still one of the most confusing scenarios I've seen in baseball. The pitching staff stepped up and shut down a very good hitting team in the Angels in that series. We had seats that were in the upper deck overlooking the bullpen and I can only remember someone getting up to throw once or twice."

My screaming during the Pods walk-off woke here up, and I ended up having to rock her for a good hour to get her back to sleep. As a result, I whisper-screamed after Blum's homer.  I didn't have the money to buy a ticket back then, and I had to be a good father/husband, so I watched all of the games at home on TV. I still loved it though. My brother from Florida was in town for the Blum homer game, so we stayed up watching it, knowing that I would have to give my daughter a bottle at around 4 in the morning."

whitesox,381lvr,Mr__Irrelevant,3,Mon Jun 1 07:34:21 2015 UTC,You should seek the help from the mods over at /r/chicagobulls or/and /r/chibears. Those subs are consistently voted as one of the best in their respected main subs.
whitesox,381lvr,johncocksack,3,Mon Jun 1 11:28:21 2015 UTC,/r/hawks as well has a sweet design and would like a design for this sub similar to theirs.
whitesox,381lvr,Mr__Irrelevant,3,Mon Jun 1 18:06:11 2015 UTC,Design help?
whitesox,381lvr,Chi_Sox_Hawks,3,Mon Jun 1 11:45:29 2015 UTC,"For sure! If anything, they will at least point you in the right direction. Have Chicago sports be the best subs on Reddit"
whitesox,381lvr,loulevin19,2,Mon Jun 1 11:58:37 2015 UTC,What should the text on the sidebar say for the subscribers present?  Open to suggestions.

whitesox,381lvr,CheddarGuevara,3,Tue Jun 2 23:18:29 2015 UTC,"Ok, so I have a few thoughts. First and foremost, looking at the other Chicago sports subs, they do the awesome thing of linking to /r/whitesox, so that definitely should be reciprocated (even /r/ChiCubs has it).  I personally don't like a few things about the design of this subreddit, like the martini upvote (it's fun but it really doesn't look good), I Paulie at the bottom of the page, or the backdrop sox logo. If I had my way, these three things would go.  What really has the most potential is the sidebar and the banner. I mocked up a banner pretty quickly, so it's certainly not polished, but I like the look of it, a bit more modern and streamlined (http://i.imgur.com/GDxjBlW.jpg). One thing /r/Chicagobulls does that is awesome is their retired numbers and championship years act as links to the wikipages for the person/season, which I think is very very cool. The side bar is just hard to get info from. What if we had a small boxscore of yesterday's game, todays, and tomorrows with links to the postgame thread and the gameday thread for the first two? Then from there, a nicer looking ALC standings?  Finally, I think the flair could use some help. Maybe a few more player faces, updated roster numbers, retired number flair, and just organizing the nav. box (it's quite hard to go through...).  I'm trying to be helpful here, I know I have more than a few criticisms, but I spend so much time here that I'd really love a good lookin' sub. I don't really know much about coding, and my photoshop is remedial, but I'd love to help in any way I can. Thanks for stepping up Mods, it means a whole lot!"
whitesox,381lvr,Chi_Sox_Hawks,2,Mon Jun 1 20:11:39 2015 UTC,"I agree with the championship years and retired numbers being links to information.  Link up with the other Chicago sports reddits, yes.  Our skyline is so badass, I felt it should be included, here is my mock-up so far.  It might also be a little 'fun' and could get cheesy, but when someone clicks an upvote, have a little firework graphic explode?  http://i.imgur.com/fLS5ekG.png  I'm all about making it look modern and streamlined."
whitesox,381lvr,nalesia,3,Mon Jun 1 21:03:07 2015 UTC,Starting Point  I don't have photoshop at work or anything fancy so this is pretty much a paint project a possible idea to get the ball rolling.  Hopefully somebody can take this and make it super sweet!  Edit. Starting Point v.2 for some reason it didn't save the most important part the first time.  Edit 2. TL:DR So here are my overall ideas:  Starting Point v.2  Main Page  Sidebar  I personally like http://i.imgur.com/9f2ZiUC.png from u/OpSecAccount for the banner though.
whitesox,381lvr,ElTunaGrande,2,Mon Jun 1 12:17:42 2015 UTC,Drink in the jumbotron: nice touch 👌
whitesox,381lvr,nalesia,2,Mon Jun 1 22:00:39 2015 UTC,"Looking around on different subs and reading the comments I think this page is going to turn out amazing. I like a lot of the ideas of the different link buttons and I took some stuff I saw on other sites and put it together to kind of show what I think could work. I do think we need to change the names from readers and users, to something more team specific. Main Page That and I like the idea of cleaning up the sidebar a lot, I put together a little sidebar description of what I think would look pretty good. Sidebar"

Detroit and Kansas city ""hate us cuz they ain't us"" and as an inhabitant of the TC, I can tell you they have this weird little brother complex.   4) Chris Sale can be kind of a douchebag (though none of our players are wife beaters or drunks like in Detroit)  5) We've had historical rivalries.  6) People don't realize we're not the large market team they think we are.

whitesox,37zf5o,samlincoln,1 point,Sun May 31 18:48:59 2015 UTC,His call down was like 99% defensive reasons though. His slash line was solid. Sanchez looked great in AAA but it hasn't transferred this season or last. Small sample size but a lot of people seen this coming.
whitesox,37zf5o,chocoholicsoxfan,1 point,Sun May 31 19:09:26 2015 UTC,"I think it was a combo but youre right Micah was coming along offensively. However, If we are relying on MJ to provide the offense we got bigger problems...which we do"

whitesox,37zlsd,chisoxbot,11,Sun May 31 19:14:34 2015 UTC,".500 in May. If they didn't completely shit the bed after that win streak this team would easily be at or above .500 overall.   Some thoughts...   Laroche actually has turned it around.  Abreu had a very subpar May and I'm a little worried.  Alexei is under 600 ops on the season and he is not showing any signs of warming up Yet. He is way more rally killer than rally starter.   He actually improved his OPS in May to land at .591.  :-/ Flowers is a little above 0.500 OPS in May.. .528 and hopeless.  Yikes. I can't say 3B is as bad of a problem as C is.  Gillaspie is at least ""okay"" offensively for his position -- .810 OPS in May. Bullpen is great overall.  Defense = below average, but not Beckham-letting-Mets-score-in-2013 bad.   Edited to add:   Melky Cabrera is having a terrible season.  Adam Eaton is slugging 70 points higher than him, and Eaton was shit until about May 5th.  MELKY CABRERA HAS FOUR EXTRA-BASE HITS."
whitesox,37zlsd,99levtt,2,Sun May 31 21:40:33 2015 UTC,"Abreu's hand has apparently been bothering him for a few weeks now, and he's finally decided to sit out, so I'm not super worried there.   As for everything else? Panic mode is beginning. Especially with Alexei."

During his deposition, however, he said that Danks never asked him how he was doing — either outside or after he was brought inside — and was unresponsive to his calls for help.   Interesting.     When he was released by the hospital, Papst remained in Chicago for about a month of treatment at the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago.  And after the fiancée asked Danks to loan the Papst family $78,500 for the rehabilitation bills, the ballplayer agreed, according to bank records filed with the court.  Papst next saw Danks at his house about three months later, and Danks also attended ""Birdies for Blake,"" a fundraiser put on by Papst family and friends in Texas.  ""I remember telling him that he had a good season,"" Papst testified. He said he didn't tell Danks he was upset with him.  Two years later, Papst filed his lawsuit. Six months earlier, Danks had signed a five-year $65-million extension with the Sox.   Sounds like Papst's lawyer telling him that Danks might possibly be liable in his drugged and drunken fall.  Two years later.   Deposition testimony shows that Danks offered a $2 million settlement that Papst and his family turned down   Interesting again.    All in all, it sounds like someone who took drugs, was drinking heavily, did something stupid that paralyzed themselves.  NOBODY there, not even the victims brother (according to Danks testimony, who urged NOT to call paramedics) did anything.    Pretty shitty situation to be in when you have as much money as Danks has, but this suit is basically saying that Danks REFUSED to call 911, which it doesn't seem to be the case from what's been released.    People do dumb shit to cause themselves harm, and in the US, if someone could possibly be liable, the action taken is to sue said person.  When that person has millions of dollars, then the desire to sue is greater.      I won't comment any further, because the only thing I've read is this article, but it looks like Danks got himself into a pretty shitty messed up convoluted situation... That is all.    SUPER-EDIT: more related to baseball things, this incident happened in 2010. Two years later, in 2012, Danks was sued by his former friend.  Danks had his shoulder surgery in 2012, came back as not the Danks we know.  I can't help but think that this somehow plays into this whole drama.  /removes tin-foil hat  Good win tonight, though, AMIRITE?"
whitesox,37suev,OpSecAccount,2,Sat May 30 06:41:43 2015 UTC,The Tribune article also highlights the coincidence of Papst filing his lawsuit after Danks signed his current incredibly rich contract that we all hate.
whitesox,37suev,mycrows,5,Sat May 30 15:20:47 2015 UTC,Sounds like Danks has a couple of idiot friends.     He offered plenty enough money to settle any kind of liability he may have had.     I've met Danks several times and he's been more than cordial. I give him the benefit of the doubt and take him for his word. This just really seems like the guy is looking for a payday and can't take responsibility for his own actions.
whitesox,37suev,ricker182,2,Sat May 30 23:34:14 2015 UTC,Can we get the text for it?
whitesox,37suev,weasol12,1 point,Sun May 31 05:56:06 2015 UTC,I think the pay wall is gone now.
whitesox,37suev,chocoholicsoxfan,2,Sat May 30 12:26:26 2015 UTC,"According to his own account, it sounds like Danks showed really poor judgment during the whole situation. He definitely should have sprung for a trip to the ER if one of his guests is laying on his deck and can't move. But the $2 million settlement he offered seems pretty generous, and it sounds like he already paid the guy's medical expenses. I wonder if the plaintiff will get more than that at trial."
whitesox,37t69p,chisoxbot,16,Sat May 30 04:42:53 2015 UTC,Good win tonight boys! I'm glad Rodon had a good walk-less start and our guys eked out a win without Abreau and Garcia in the lineup.  Good win for the Sox! Let's keep the fight alive and get one tomorrow!

whitesox,37t69p,TheHoneyBadger23,4,Sat May 30 05:26:08 2015 UTC,"eked out a win without Abreau    Don't take this personal, many people like yourself aren't advanced at knowing baseball like gentlemen like myself, but Abreu did play and contributed to the win by scoring a run.  I know you probably think he didn't because he only had 1 hit and he didn't hit a home run, but scoring a run is very important ina game.  I suggest you check out the 2002 Oakland Athletics. Whoever put them team together was a genius."

They are good enough quality that unless you were within five feet of me and were looking for reasons it might be a fake you wouldn't suspect otherwise.  To me this is totally worth the $75 price drop.

It's obvious that him and Stone don't have the best chemistry but I would choose their commentary over just about anyone's in baseball.

whitesox,37s55m,TheHoneyBadger23,3,Sat May 30 03:41:51 2015 UTC,I like him but nice change of pace. Just his voice and tone makes the game seem more repetitive then it already is. Chuck is awesome too. No need to fill in silence just call the game.

whitesox,37s55m,ricker182,2,Sat May 30 01:59:56 2015 UTC,Altuve came straight from Venezula to Houston's system and was passed up by many scouts.
whitesox,37s55m,samlincoln,2,Sat May 30 02:00:09 2015 UTC,Fuckin Carter.
whitesox,37s55m,CheddarGuevara,2,Sat May 30 02:17:14 2015 UTC,Abreau should've made a better throw  Rodon shouldn't have hopped  Carter was just a hint quicker down the line  Damnit I hate admitting all that

whitesox,37s55m,ricker182,2,Sat May 30 02:53:44 2015 UTC,Kinda disappointing when Beckham is your most productive hitter.
whitesox,37s55m,ricker182,2,Sat May 30 03:07:34 2015 UTC,Fuck Joe West. How the fuck does he still have a job?

whitesox,37s55m,bababooey55,2,Sat May 30 03:27:47 2015 UTC,The struggle to score runs is baffling.

whitesox,37s55m,ForteShadesOfJay,2,Sat May 30 04:14:39 2015 UTC,This is the longest Joe West has ever gone without eating.     Although I thought I saw him sneak a chicken finger in the 6th inning.

whitesox,37s55m,CheddarGuevara,1 point,Sat May 30 01:36:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah i'm using Chrome. And yeah it's within the browser window, so it must be new player"
whitesox,37s55m,TheHoneyBadger23,1 point,Sat May 30 01:37:41 2015 UTC,I use it.  I was streaming through Chrome at work and it was choppy.  Switched to Firefox and the new player ran smooth.  Firefox uses a lot less of your processor than Chrome does.  I also stream it through my Roku at home and works like Howard's Sybian.

whitesox,37n0qw,Intelligenttrees,3,Thu May 28 21:07:40 2015 UTC,Chris sale was nasty as fuck in game 1. I missed the last few innings though. I wanna see D-Rob pitch again

whitesox,37n0qw,NineduceXII,2,Thu May 28 21:37:50 2015 UTC,We are finding creative ways to hit into these double plays now.
whitesox,37n0qw,samlincoln,2,Thu May 28 21:46:42 2015 UTC,Beck needs to hold them.
whitesox,37n0qw,samlincoln,2,Thu May 28 21:47:06 2015 UTC,Ok remember how Scott Carroll had a PHENOMENAL first start and was mediocre the rest of the season?  Maybe the reverse will happen here!
whitesox,37n0qw,raj96,2,Thu May 28 22:33:32 2015 UTC,I think it was against the Rays
whitesox,37n0qw,samlincoln,2,Thu May 28 22:37:25 2015 UTC,I dunno about leaving Beck in here.

whitesox,37lxbp,chocoholicsoxfan,7,Thu May 28 18:42:48 2015 UTC,Let's hope LaRoche stays hot for the next game.

whitesox,37lxbp,samlincoln,1 point,Thu May 28 20:45:49 2015 UTC,Who's announcing for Hawk today? Is it permanent? fingers crossed

whitesox,37muh7,chisoxbot,10,Thu May 28 20:03:45 2015 UTC,I am a huge fan of this Chris Sale and his slider from hell.
whitesox,37muh7,99levtt,7,Thu May 28 20:07:01 2015 UTC,I just happened to be shopping just now and I happened to pass the children's Activewear section and so I happened to find a Sale shirt on sale so it happened to make its way into my cart and I just happened to buy it.  These wins make me way too crazy.
whitesox,37muh7,chocoholicsoxfan,3,Thu May 28 20:20:25 2015 UTC,I thought that Flowers DP ball had gameover written all over it.  I'm glad it was Beckham being aggressive was the one on the base paths.
whitesox,37muh7,PigFarmington,3,Thu May 28 20:30:14 2015 UTC,Where is the game thread? STIR IT UP!
whitesox,37muh7,chocoholicsoxfan,2,Thu May 28 20:44:33 2015 UTC,No game thread for the 2nd game? Eaton hit a dinger!

whitesox,37muh7,ACSimeon,1 point,Thu May 28 20:40:17 2015 UTC,Just post your own thread guys.
whitesox,37muh7,NineduceXII,1 point,Thu May 28 20:46:02 2015 UTC,Did it.
whitesox,37no9r,KKJones1744,1 point,Thu May 28 23:45:15 2015 UTC,"He's on a medical leave right now, otherwise he does both home and away."

whitesox,37no9r,pohodo3,2,Fri May 29 00:10:46 2015 UTC,He's gonna be back for our next home game. It's about a week from now I think
whitesox,37no9r,Fast_Hands_Lou,1 point,Fri May 29 00:22:51 2015 UTC,"I had heard not too serious, i think he was gonna be off for three weeks maybe?"
whitesox,37no9r,HunterS,1 point,Fri May 29 00:50:24 2015 UTC,"For the gaff quotes go to Boers & Bernstein sound board, which I think is on their website. ""Sacks packed with seamen"" when calling a game where the Mariners had bases loaded was my favorite. I think he did that on purpose though."
whitesox,37hy4k,ElTunaGrande,10,Wed May 27 19:41:10 2015 UTC,Unbelievable.
whitesox,37hy4k,georgstgeegland,5,Wed May 27 19:43:19 2015 UTC,Willing to bet Donaldson comes back up in the order in the 11th or 12th and walks off again.
whitesox,37hy4k,reddit2therescue,4,Wed May 27 19:46:10 2015 UTC,Your on
whitesox,37hy4k,Boopa1219,2,Wed May 27 22:22:19 2015 UTC,"Might as well pitch to him, because behind him there's Joey Bats and Encarcion."
whitesox,37joy0,chocoholicsoxfan,7,Thu May 28 02:58:25 2015 UTC,"Chris Beck is a pretty promising young pitcher. I'm excited to see him pitch because I feel like the Sox really groom their pitching prospects really well. Hopefully he can plug up some of the holes in the rotation. Sale, Shark, Q, Rodon, and a good Beck would be a killer, young rotation."
whitesox,37joy0,whitesoxman77,2,Thu May 28 04:30:47 2015 UTC,Here's hoping Beck gives us a Quality Start today.
whitesox,37joy0,ACSimeon,5,Thu May 28 15:22:18 2015 UTC,Just talked with my pops about this. I am anxious to see how he performs.  Is he up so the rotation gets rest? Or is he showcasing for the Sox/other teams? Either way I just want a double header win tomorrow
whitesox,37joy0,warhawkguy,3,Thu May 28 03:33:40 2015 UTC,"He is up because it is a double header. The pitcher that Sale is going up against was also brought up for the double header.   During double headers rosters get expanded to 26. When Sox played their DH against the Reds, Beck was brought up for BP insurance.  Any more questions feel free to ask me, I had a lot of experience running major league teams throughout the years,."
whitesox,37joy0,BillyBeane10,5,Thu May 28 06:48:29 2015 UTC,I would laugh so hard if this guy is actually Billy Beane.   We are the chosen sub! (And /r/baseball)
whitesox,37joy0,warhawkguy,3,Thu May 28 07:37:55 2015 UTC,Thanks Billy! Totally spaced about the roster expansion bit.
whitesox,37joy0,heyaboo,3,Thu May 28 11:30:55 2015 UTC,He had some good stuff in spring training and is our number 12 prospect overall. He got drafted by Cleveland but turned them down.
whitesox,37joy0,socklessmoejohnson,6,Thu May 28 04:07:44 2015 UTC,"I'd love it if he became some sort of no-hitter throwing, dominating scourge of Cleveland."
whitesox,37joy0,heyaboo,2,Thu May 28 11:55:20 2015 UTC,"Seriously, we need to find a way to stop losing series against them. Lets hope he's our ticket."
whitesox,37joy0,samlincoln,2,Thu May 28 11:59:43 2015 UTC,I can't believe he made it and is starting! He's been on my radar ever since reading this story about him: http://www.csnchicago.com/white-sox/white-sox-smartest-shape-life-has-chris-beck-thriving
whitesox,37joy0,jrerik95,2,Thu May 28 04:11:59 2015 UTC,So did the White Sox Twitter make a mistake or why is Daniel Webb the 26th man today?   http://twitter.com/whitesox/status/603921197240320000
whitesox,37joy0,thegreystash,2,Thu May 28 14:40:48 2015 UTC,double header rosters get expanded to 26
whitesox,37joy0,jrerik95,3,Thu May 28 14:56:43 2015 UTC,"I get that, but if Beck is starting shouldn't he be the 26th man?"
whitesox,37hcri,freshapepper,15,Wed May 27 17:18:38 2015 UTC,Steve Stone and AJ
whitesox,37hcri,PigFarmington,11,Wed May 27 17:32:46 2015 UTC,I guess we have to have somebody that everyone hates but us.
whitesox,37hcri,socklessmoejohnson,17,Wed May 27 18:25:33 2015 UTC,"I really love how  Chuck is feeding Stone Pony questions. I'm learning a LOT more about how baseball functions nowadays, rather than how it was played 40 years ago.  Enough trips down memory lane. More sabre metrics please"
whitesox,37hcri,jmgfootball123,3,Wed May 27 18:41:48 2015 UTC,"Exactly, I feel like announcers don't do this enough. Ask questions to the pros even if they seem obvious. Generates great discussion about philosophies of the game and stories as well."
whitesox,37hcri,SultanofStella,4,Thu May 28 01:32:46 2015 UTC,Sabremetrics are just to new.  You got to have that WTW

whitesox,37hcri,samurai5625,8,Wed May 27 20:38:26 2015 UTC,Someone who has no past ties to the organization who can call the game in a professional manner while keeping up with the times.
whitesox,37hcri,ggslovin,17,Wed May 27 17:40:58 2015 UTC,Opposite day!!
whitesox,37hcri,thom_weights,12,Wed May 27 17:54:09 2015 UTC,Honest question: why? You don't enjoy someone who is excited for your team? Do you like watching bears games? I always wish that it was a hometown announcer. I respectfully disagree with your preference.
whitesox,37hcri,roofkelly,1 point,Wed May 27 20:15:00 2015 UTC,"Really the difference im enjoying is a game where the sox are losing and I'm learning why, opposed to a game where the sox are losing and I'm depressed along with hawk."
whitesox,37hcri,HunterS,1 point,Sat May 30 04:10:38 2015 UTC,Idk. I've always found him to be very smart and insightful about the game. But it's just preference I suppose.
whitesox,37hcri,roofkelly,1 point,Sat May 30 05:31:33 2015 UTC,"There is a difference between getting excited and being an over the top, absolute homer."
whitesox,37hcri,ggslovin,9,Wed May 27 20:20:40 2015 UTC,"What's wrong with being a homer? It's implied that the hometown guys are rooting for the hometown team. Half the reason I watch the games is because of Hawk. In a sport like baseball, you desperately need an entertaining announcer."
whitesox,37hcri,Smooth_On_Smooth,2,Thu May 28 00:03:14 2015 UTC,It's interesting to hear Chuck call the game and not lose his shit every time the Sox do something good.  There's a certain control to his voice that Hawk has never had.  I liked Hawk 10 years ago.. now not so much.
whitesox,37hcri,99levtt,3,Thu May 28 00:24:35 2015 UTC,"I actually agree.  Hawk is sometimes fun when he gets excited.  But, mostly I just find him annoying.  I don't need him huffing and grumbling when something goes wrong.  I especially don't need to hear him yell into the mic over a call he deems incorrect.  Its also annoying that a lot of the time he talks up our players and talks down the other team etc.  He was the freaking conductor for the Gordan Beckham swinging the bat well hype train for years."
whitesox,37hcri,Mrslinger85,0,Thu May 28 14:32:52 2015 UTC,Hawk....lol
whitesox,37gyuv,chisoxbot,11,Wed May 27 15:43:27 2015 UTC,"Wow, what a game.  Robertson gives up the save but locks down a W. Jeff should've gotten the W for pitching his ass off.   But at the end of the day, that's a WHITE SOX WINNER!"
whitesox,37gyuv,warhawkguy,3,Wed May 27 20:09:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Shark shoulda got that W...."
whitesox,37gyuv,socklessmoejohnson,6,Wed May 27 20:20:42 2015 UTC,It's almost as if pitcher wins are a very flawed stat.

whitesox,37gyuv,samlincoln,9,Wed May 27 19:42:31 2015 UTC,"We need this win, and of course Donaldson takes Robertson yard 2 nights in a row."
whitesox,37gyuv,socklessmoejohnson,2,Wed May 27 19:42:14 2015 UTC,Should have grabbed an insurance run in the 9th too.
whitesox,37gyuv,chocoholicsoxfan,1 point,Wed May 27 19:43:39 2015 UTC,We were gifted 2 runs earlier so 1-1 really.

whitesox,37gyuv,plant_man,2,Wed May 27 16:01:37 2015 UTC,"I know they won't fire him, and I still have faith in him unless he loses today. It's just that you can't get handed the keys to a playoff caliber line-up, and get swept by a mediocre Blue Jays team in late May."

whitesox,37gyuv,loulevin19,2,Wed May 27 18:50:28 2015 UTC,"I would prefer Micah up in this situation. I'm starting to want him back. Yea his defense is bad, but he was batting a hundred points higher than Sanchez. It's up for debate.   EDIT: Sanchez deserves more ABs though."
whitesox,37gyuv,ACSimeon,2,Wed May 27 18:57:09 2015 UTC,If we could just fuse the two together that would be good. Gotta get someone working on that.

whitesox,37gyuv,loulevin19,2,Wed May 27 19:31:42 2015 UTC,"Yea his few clutch hits, defense, and attitude/likability keep him off my shit list but my god he has zero power. He is slugging .275. That would be an okay batting average. However, his defense has been very solid. Big improvement over Viciedo (a replacement level fielder looks great compared to Dayan). Still out of a 2 hole hitter he isn't getting the job done, so I'm pretty disappointed too.  My most disappointing players...there's too many to choose from."

whitesox,37eqxn,thegreystash,10,Wed May 27 02:26:45 2015 UTC,That's just how he pitches.  He's a direct descendant of the Mariano Rivera school of pitching.  If it's a 1 run game he's going to be lights. out.  If you have a lead 2 runs or bigger he's always going to make it interesting.

whitesox,37imcp,swider,3,Wed May 27 23:38:56 2015 UTC,HOTTAKE
whitesox,37imcp,swider,3,Thu May 28 00:02:50 2015 UTC,You're crazy. Can't let a stud 9 hitter like Ryan Goins and his career .230 against righties beat you.
whitesox,37imcp,swider,-2,Wed May 27 22:29:37 2015 UTC,? They already announced Valencia as the hitter. Can't pinch hit after that.
whitesox,37imcp,BernankesBeard,1 point,Wed May 27 22:49:16 2015 UTC,"I was agreeing with you. Using sarcasm.  I think people in this thread are convinced you're a troll (and maybe you are), but you're absolutely right in this case. Robin has to realize that they're going to pinch hit once he brings in the lefty. Goins against a righty is a better option than Valencia against a lefty. It's really not even close.  The lineup thing is interesting, but I don't mind Abreu hitting third as long as he gets protection from whoever is behind him. That person should be Avi, but Robin is convinced the order has to alternate handedness, which is wrong."
whitesox,37imcp,ricker182,-2,Wed May 27 22:50:27 2015 UTC,Thank you. It really is annoying when people call others trolls for no reason just because they don't understand sabermetrics or cant say anything negative about their favorite team.
whitesox,37imcp,ricker182,1 point,Thu May 28 02:21:58 2015 UTC,"I say negative things about my team when they're true. This happens to be true. I'm not sure why you chose to say it like a complete dick, but at least it's accurate."
whitesox,37imcp,BernankesBeard,3,Thu May 28 05:17:51 2015 UTC,"He's batting .400 against lefties over only 36 PAs this year. If you knew as much as you claim, you'd recognize that that's a tiny sample size.   Over his career, he's .333 against lefties over 588 PAs and .227 against righties over 1028 PAs. And even these sample sizes aren't great. When you consider that his BABIP against lefties is .367 and .266 against righties, his underlying platoon skill is likely smaller than that.   Typical platoon skill is about .040 of wOBA with the most extreme righties having an estimated platoon skill of about .060. Furthermore, the pinch-hitting penalty, which is estimated to also be about .040 of wOBA, should almost cancel out his platoon advantage.   Was it a great move? No. But throwing our best lefty reliever against a career 92 wRC+ hitter isn't even close to the worst decision Robin has made this year."
whitesox,37ev3b,chisoxbot,9,Wed May 27 02:53:14 2015 UTC,"Legitimate, 100% serious question.  What are the odds of Robin Ventura getting a contract extension this year?  I'd honestly put them at 40-45% right now because our FO seems so clueless. I know they're not, but they're doing a damn good impression of it."
whitesox,37ev3b,chocoholicsoxfan,3,Wed May 27 03:17:28 2015 UTC,"Whether or not I have any faith in Robin is dependent on his ability to win against the Blue Jays with the best pitching match up for the White Sox of this series tomorrow. Tonight was unlucky, but it won't excuse us being swept."
whitesox,37ev3b,ACSimeon,8,Wed May 27 04:28:01 2015 UTC,"Offense was encouraging, I guess the Danks start at Oakland was an outlier. Maybe we can salvage a win tomorrow."
whitesox,37ev3b,AnDEErew,9,Wed May 27 02:56:22 2015 UTC,"Okay gang, here is my two cents  Yes, we are struggling and everyone in the world knows it. Times are down, morale here is low, but at the end of the day it is MLB. Anything can happen.   That being said, the Sox do need a major turn around if they want to even contend. Roughly a fourth of the season in and a lot more baseball left to play, I still have faith they will be entertaining. Maybe a wild card push? Who knows...  With the that I bid you all goodnight. Let's hope the get a W tomorrow and go hawks!"
whitesox,37ev3b,warhawkguy,4,Wed May 27 03:42:18 2015 UTC,"How many turnarounds do we need? It seems like every post, every article, every player is saying that we have to just 'turn things around', 'I'm just going to keep my head down, work hard and hopefully things will turn around'.  People have been saying this since the first sweep against KC and other than the 6-game win streak nothing has been good about this team other than the bullpen, who just blew a heartbreaker last night anyway. The Phillies had a 6-game winning streak at the exact same time, and nobody is holding onto that as an example of a good team 'turning things around'.  The White Sox are dead fucking last in almost every offensive stat. Almost every single player is playing below their career slashline. Something is wrong with this organisation and my optimism has been fully used up."
whitesox,37ev3b,socklessmoejohnson,2,Wed May 27 08:51:47 2015 UTC,"I totally see you point. ""Need a turn around"", ""get act together"", etc have been thrown around a lot so far for the Sox. Personally, I thought hitting was a big issue we have been facing over the last few years. Maybe a new hitting coach or coaches? I still think more can be done.  And as for the optimism part, I do not fault you given how the Sox have performed. I have been known to be optimistic no matter what, kinda just my personality. It sucks royally (pun intended) that our boys aren't producing. But as a fan, I cannot control anything they do. I put faith in that the origination will do what is necessary to win. And if they do not do that, then the higher management should make some changes as well.  I am going to a few games in the coming weeks. I'm hoping my presence and optimism might spill onto the field and the team. 100+ games left, and I'm hoping for an interesting summer"

whitesox,37ccuj,Mrslinger85,3,Tue May 26 17:38:16 2015 UTC,TIL Steve Stone (August 1985) beat Shawn Michaels (October 1996) to the punch with the Playgirl spread by over a decade.
whitesox,37dpos,DomCaboose,7,Tue May 26 21:46:42 2015 UTC,"Semien has a 125 wRC+, which would rank 2nd on the Sox. Even taking into account how bad his defense has been, he's still been worth nearly half a win more than any other position player on our roster. Both projection systems on FG have him as an above average hitter RoS, and he still has 5 years of team control left. It was a bad trade, and it's not shocking we sold low on him considering the White Sox don't seem to value plate discipline from hitters at all."
whitesox,37dpos,froglegs_jackson,3,Tue May 26 23:12:13 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say it was a bad trade. I think the decision to go for it in 2015 was short-sighted, but ignoring the bigger-picture decisions, the trade itself made sense. We gave up Semien and a decent but not particularly special pitching prospect (Bassitt) for a year of a 3.0-4.0 WAR #2-3 SP. We absolutely needed a top of the rotation starter to compete, and Semien wasn't guaranteed to be much better than the other options we had at 2B/3B (and obviously he can't play SS). Acquiring a very good starter isn't easy, and usually you have to overpay in prospects, since you're giving unproven talent to get proven talent. For example, the A's gave up Addison Russell, one of the highest-rated prospects in baseball, to get Samardzija. Semien had excellent numbers in the minors, and I would've liked to keep him, but the trade made sense at the time.   I'm with you on the Sox not valuing plate discipline. I was hoping that would change when Hahn took over as GM, but the moronic talking points about ""Grinder"" types continues."
whitesox,37dpos,important_commenter,2,Wed May 27 23:31:51 2015 UTC,"He would be a better DH than LaRoche, too."
whitesox,37dpos,OandAlifer,0,Tue May 26 23:41:51 2015 UTC,"He may have a 125 wRC+, but the defense is terrible and I don't think he would make that big of a difference.  Where would you play him? Where would he be in the lineup?    Also, I disagree that they DON'T value plate discipline.  They obviously do with Eaton (who was great at it last year, LaRoche who usually does, and Abreu is another one).  If you watched Semien last year, he showed nothing to us at the plate and they figured it wasn't going to change.  Sometimes a change of scenery (and park) helps a guy.  I think Semien hitting in more of a pitcher's park helps him because he has more room to hit it to."
whitesox,37dpos,AnniesBoobzz,2,Wed May 27 02:04:56 2015 UTC,I'd still rather have him than Alexei.
whitesox,37dpos,frakking-anustart,1 point,Wed May 27 05:11:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah its abysmal, but with Wash's help it will improve dramatically.  Then he'll be the player we traded for. Not like he already is, I mean he is learning a new position."

Had he not been injured, I'm sure he would be pitching much better and at least be somewhat earning his contract.  Deserving of the highest paid on our team? No, but he was a good pitcher when we inked him to the deal. It's not like we threw all that money to a scrub who always played this bad."

whitesox,37bqhm,PigFarmington,10,Tue May 26 13:58:56 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong I'm still going to watch, just not get my hopes up. This is currently the worst offense in MLB and I'm adjusting my expectations accordingly."
whitesox,37bqhm,Cheeky_buggah,6,Tue May 26 14:01:36 2015 UTC,Everything about this team shows that the best they can do is maybe lead us on and give us hope but end up 4 games out of the last wild card spot.
whitesox,37bqhm,PigFarmington,5,Tue May 26 14:44:27 2015 UTC,"Where's the hope?  Sox are last in HR, R, SB, RBIs, Walks too... what's there to cling to?  Getting behind at the beginning of most games, and losing 5-0 doesn't really fill me with hope.  A couple weeks ago, sure.  But c'mon... losing to the Blue Jays in that manner?     There is so much that can happen between now and the all-star break.   In the next two weeks we play Houston twice and Detroit."
whitesox,37bqhm,PigFarmington,1 point,Tue May 26 14:53:07 2015 UTC,"~25% of the season has been completed. That is a good chunk of the season for sure, but consider last year. In August we ran out of gas, falling 10 games below .500. I am not convinced we are getting a level of play out of the talent on the team. Abreu is clearly not beasting like he's capable of. Shark is shit, he's not shit. Eaton, LaDunn, Sale, are under-performing. There is one man charged with getting the most out of all the players, I think once he is gone we'll be better off. /u/socklessmoejohnson, /u/warbrain, /u/PigFarmington there's nothing wrong with taking the underdog role, let's fucking thrive in it."

Even if it's Beckham, Robin's dumbass rarely starts him.  Getting nearly swept by Cleveland, only getting one from MN, then yesterday's clusterfuck.     I think once he is gone we'll be better off.   Right, but when will that be?  After everyone gets traded away?   I am not convinced we are getting a level of play out of the talent on the team.    I agree, but when will this happen?  Will it happen?  I keep waiting, and we're not 2 months gone and have yet to really see it.  Its not like it's just a couple guys, it's 90% of the team!"
whitesox,37bqhm,PigFarmington,10,Tue May 26 15:14:13 2015 UTC,"A team that spends $120M on salary and promptly puts up the worst offensive numbers in baseball is not an underdog, it's a massive and expensive disappointment."
whitesox,37bqhm,Cheeky_buggah,2,Tue May 26 15:36:49 2015 UTC,Exactly.  This isn't a shoe-sting budget team here.
whitesox,37bqhm,ExplainsSocialEnigma,0,Tue May 26 15:40:15 2015 UTC,"But it's not like they've got the biggest payroll in the mlb either. I don't even think they'd even be in the top half of teams in terms of payroll this season.   It's still very disappointing, but there's still a lot of season left and they're only 4 games under .500, which isn't terrible considering how poorly they've played so far this season."

I guess this is really the only sliver of hope to cling to.  And maybe... just maybe, someone will be a leader on the team and motivate them.  They really do look like they don't care at the plate, except maybe Garcia, Beckham and Eaton (though he's not putting up last year's numbers)."

Alexei is only gone if they have an internal option to be a stopgap until Tim Anderson is ready. I would want nothing more than see Flowers traded but that is probably just a fantasy. Could also see LaRoche (everybody needs lefty power especially in the AL), Danks (if the Sox eat up a significant amount of his contract), and Soto all traded."

whitesox,37bilo,AnniesBoobzz,1 point,Tue May 26 17:14:00 2015 UTC,That is a great suggestion. Saladino would have been called up last September if not for an injury. Alexei could fetch us a decent haul and it just looks like he is uninterested out there
whitesox,37bilo,whitesox20051,5,Tue May 26 18:36:45 2015 UTC,"I would like to see Shark traded, but I also wouldn't mind letting him stay the whole year so we can let him walk in free agency and get a compensation pick next year. Really depends on what teams are willing to give up for Shark at the trade deadline."
whitesox,37bilo,AnniesBoobzz,1 point,Tue May 26 17:15:39 2015 UTC,It's going to get blown up.  Alexei will finally be traded. Shark is gone. No one will take Dank's contract this year. Eaton is pretty much untradeable with his production and contract. Beckham could be an interesting trade piece.
whitesox,37bilo,TwoFatCats,6,Tue May 26 12:27:34 2015 UTC,Beckham is the one ray of sunshine for this season

He isn't the only one.  He was great for the team last year, but this whole team is an issue.  Before selling someone like that off though, you usually want to have someone in place who could do that job.  What center fielder do we have in our system that is worth it?  What free agents are there this offseason?  Your best options for free agents are Dexter Fowler, Austin Jackson, and Colby Rasmus as youth goes.  Take a look at it.  There isn't anything great as I see it.  I would rather hold Eaton."

whitesox,37bq50,snipcity,1 point,Tue May 26 15:32:10 2015 UTC,"I want to read one that says, ""Alexei plans on thinking about trying to not to hit into a double play for 2 games, quoted as saying ""baby-steps""."""
whitesox,37bq50,PigFarmington,2,Tue May 26 15:34:10 2015 UTC,"Melky has THREE extra-base hits on the season and a .560 OPS.  It's physically hard to produce less than he has done. I don't know what track he wants to get back on, but right now any route is better than his."
whitesox,37bq50,stackshot,2,Wed May 27 13:54:52 2015 UTC,Especially slotting him into the two-spot. Glad Robin decided to finally shake up the lineup. Yesterday was the first time there was actual flow from top to bottom

whitesox,379t9e,froglegs_jackson,15,Tue May 26 01:10:38 2015 UTC,"The offense is really fucking bad. We've scored the least runs in baseball (147) that's bad. The Phillies have more. Back of the rotation is garbage, defense is horrendous. So essentially all phases have been terrible."
whitesox,379t9e,thraser11,3,Tue May 26 01:17:54 2015 UTC,"Not only that, but we are allowing the most runs on average in the first inning in the whole league. We're setting ourselves up for losses before the games really even get going."

Parts of the bullpen look great, parts of the rotation has shown flashes of greatness.. Defense has been horrible, baserunning has been terrible.. The talent is there.. are they a 100+ win team?  No, I dont think so, but I certainly think they could contend.  Nearly everyone on the coaching staff needs to go."

whitesox,379t9e,Dudeist-Priest,6,Tue May 26 01:26:13 2015 UTC,Coaching. Everyone on offense is hitting for way less average and power than their career averages. Our 2 through 6 has the ability to hit 30 longballs each but they are all struggling.  If you use 2014 stats. Our offense should be hitting .270. There is no way this is natural regression. That's sometime fucking with mechanics
whitesox,379t9e,lostmessage256,1 point,Tue May 26 01:52:46 2015 UTC,"It isnt just the offense though; it is everything from defense to pitching. All starters have a +4 ERA. Defense makes mistakes which lead to extended innings (whether it is an error or bad decision making).  They are also last in stolen bases (and the only team with a stolen base to caught stealing ratio less than 1).  Either these players are really bad at what they do or the coaching staff hasnt been doing what they need to do, which is to teach them the basic fundamentals of baseball."
whitesox,379t9e,Spaaace_Ghooost,7,Tue May 26 05:49:45 2015 UTC,"To anyone blaming Rick Hahn, put your pitchforks down. While he's not perfect, he did a great job this offseason filling needs with what was available. How was he supposed to predict Melky and Laroche having such slow starts? The issues at large here are the manager, defense and back end of the rotation."
whitesox,379t9e,callmeroo,1 point,Tue May 26 02:25:43 2015 UTC,was he supposed to predict Melky and Laroche having such slow starts?   This seems like a repeating theme.  Just change the names and it seems this has been an expectation with a Ventura managed team.

whitesox,379t9e,frenchhornhero,2,Tue May 26 04:01:26 2015 UTC,Jose Abreu said as much it made me respect him a bit more. He isn't cutting himself any slack and it seems like he's trying to light a fire under the rest of the team.
whitesox,379t9e,DomCaboose,1 point,Tue May 26 20:05:40 2015 UTC,"He isn't cutting himself any slack because he has struck out in big situations as much as he has helped in big situations.  Jose Abreu is trying to be a great leader in this clubhouse, but this whole team has a lot of issue and I don't know what exactly it is.  This team has more talent than the team last year did, yet we are just as bad.  Heck, our pitching staff has been way off, including Sale, Samardzija, and Quintana.  They haven't been the same this year so far."

whitesox,37976r,ChiTownSox,1 point,Mon May 25 23:33:07 2015 UTC,Man. What the fuck is it with our Damn pitchers giving up a shit ton of runs in the first innings?
whitesox,37976r,NineduceXII,2,Mon May 25 23:33:55 2015 UTC,Alexei with a little razzle dazzle. fail
whitesox,37976r,ChiTownSox,1 point,Mon May 25 23:37:25 2015 UTC,I thought that was a bs call. Basically because it was. How often does a neighborhood play get called safe? Usually never.
whitesox,37976r,waff1ez,1 point,Mon May 25 23:38:30 2015 UTC,I guess I need to see another replay but it looked like he did not touch the base.

whitesox,37976r,froglegs_jackson,2,Mon May 25 23:37:38 2015 UTC,"He's still at least a year and a half away. Plate discipline and defense have been shaky, but that's to be expected from someone with such little baseball experience."

whitesox,37976r,chocoholicsoxfan,2,Tue May 26 00:03:50 2015 UTC,It's kind of remarkable he can be so good without having any type of approach at the plate. He just swings at everything.

whitesox,37976r,ricker182,1 point,Tue May 26 00:14:48 2015 UTC,"That's been a problem for years. Not being able to hit bad pitchers.    IDK. They don't pay me the big bucks to figure that out, but obviously people in this organization aren't doing their job and aren't being held accountable."

whitesox,37976r,Jaydubzsc2,1 point,Tue May 26 01:04:38 2015 UTC,He's not playing well for sure. Time to mix up the order because we aren't acquiring new players.

whitesox,37976r,froglegs_jackson,5,Mon May 25 23:30:01 2015 UTC,"Rodon is a rookie so they're limiting his innings. A lot of teams sit young starters. Yes he's taking a shit on us, but giving Rodon a rest is not idiotic. Carroll woulda been better. Noesi to AAA."

whitesox,37976r,froglegs_jackson,1 point,Mon May 25 23:36:03 2015 UTC,It's more long term than that.
whitesox,37976r,Georgie56,3,Mon May 25 23:37:24 2015 UTC,Rodon is on an innings limit. He was never going to start every 5th day once he entered the rotation.
whitesox,378hsw,whitesox20051,2,Mon May 25 19:09:35 2015 UTC,Off to a great start.
whitesox,378hsw,PigFarmington,1 point,Tue May 26 00:37:58 2015 UTC,"Think they found answers though.  A game like this brings out the imperfections.  If action isn't taken in the next week the biggest problem is ownership(which I believe has been the problem for a while).  JR needs to retire...KW needs to move on, RH needs more control.  Coaching needs a flush including Cooper."
whitesox,378hsw,slayerje1,2,Tue May 26 02:00:57 2015 UTC,Agreed. I mean... Noesi is just awful.  Who the fuck thought starting him is a good idea. Would rather Carol.
whitesox,378hsw,PigFarmington,2,Tue May 26 02:02:26 2015 UTC,"Everything I've seen from Carroll so far, I'm clueless to why he wasn't chosen to pitch...oh well.  For the love of god I hope they figure this shit out."
whitesox,378hsw,slayerje1,1 point,Tue May 26 02:07:57 2015 UTC,"I'm sure Noesi will get more starts...I mean, he's 0-4. Robins logic is to get him back in there."

whitesox,3757zj,TheHoneyBadger23,6,Mon May 25 03:34:38 2015 UTC,I'm confident Robin won't be managing the Sox next year!

whitesox,3757zj,Cheeky_buggah,3,Mon May 25 01:10:22 2015 UTC,I'm not sure how long it's going to take Hahn to realize that Robin isn't right for this team.  I'm ready for a change....I think these players need a change!
whitesox,3757zj,epictrole,3,Mon May 25 04:06:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, just like the veterans ""jump started"" the season last year.  And the veterans ""jump started"" the season the year before that.  Ohh yeah, and let's not mention that over 1/4 of the season is already done and we're 8 games back.....No biggie.....Maybe Minoso will come back and give a Lombardi like speech and get the team in gear......."
whitesox,3758i2,TheHoneyBadger23,12,Mon May 25 00:06:02 2015 UTC,Very very very very doubtful he gets fired before the ASG.
whitesox,3758i2,ricker182,14,Mon May 25 00:23:04 2015 UTC,I'm doubtful he gets fired before the end of the year.
whitesox,3758i2,samurai5625,1 point,Mon May 25 00:41:35 2015 UTC,As am I. It's doubtful he gets fired before the season ends. It's very very very very doubtful he gets fired before the ASG.
whitesox,3758i2,ricker182,2,Mon May 25 00:45:12 2015 UTC,"I used to think that too but the more I think about it, the less I believe it.  The reason I say this is 2 fold.    Number 1, this season's struggles just aren't confined to this year.  This is the start of year number 3 where we've has despicable plate discipline and no concept of base running.  Secondly, if you stretch the current standings out assuming we're 1/4 of the way through the season, we, hypothetically, could be 16 games out of 1st place by the break.  In my opinion, waiting to fire him then would be the brass throwing in the towel on the season.  Fire him before and you send a message that we still believe there's a chance to turn this thing around."
whitesox,3758i2,ricker182,0,Mon May 25 00:38:04 2015 UTC,"Judging by the history of the Sox and everything Jerry Reinsdorf and Kenny Williams, he's not getting fired this early.    Now there's a chance I'm wrong and Hahn has more control of the team than I think (he has the spine to fire him), but I doubt anything happens without first KW's and JR's approval.    That isn't JR's style, but who knows now. He put a lot of money into this team and they will still turn a large profit. I just don't think he cares too much.    Edit:    To add to my view, JR doesn't care much about the success of the team anymore. He's all but said that. He's told his family to sell the team once he dies and he's going to make money off of them no matter how bad they are."

whitesox,3758i2,ACSimeon,3,Mon May 25 02:15:35 2015 UTC,"I think for Robin to be fired we would have to miss the playoffs. The only way I see him getting fired mid-season is if we're doing extremely poorly, like 15 games under .500 in late July."
whitesox,3758i2,ricker182,5,Mon May 25 00:51:04 2015 UTC,"I think for Robin to be fired we would have to miss the playoffs. The only way I see him getting fired mid-season is if we're doing extremely poorly, like 15 games under .500 in late July.     That's going to happen. 15 games under in July is also likely."
whitesox,3758i2,ACSimeon,2,Mon May 25 00:54:04 2015 UTC,I hope today was a wake up call. This was our worst loss in a minute.
whitesox,3758i2,ACSimeon,4,Mon May 25 01:06:18 2015 UTC,15 games under .500 is likely.
whitesox,3758i2,ACSimeon,1 point,Mon May 25 01:10:48 2015 UTC,"Our fielding has been pretty atrocious. I saw LaRoche admit he had to be better at the plate. I just don't want to jump on Robin for the sake of change in the midst of struggles. There are personnel moves that can still be made, but this is a playoff caliber team. If we miss it this year, I'll agree it's time."
whitesox,3758i2,ricker182,3,Mon May 25 01:48:35 2015 UTC,And yet another year lost and another year of our best players's beat years. We're spinning our wheels. It's time for a change and that time is now.
whitesox,3758i2,ACSimeon,0,Mon May 25 03:00:35 2015 UTC,"The Cleveland Cavaliers started their season 21 and 19. I understand where today was disappointing, and hopefully a wake up call, but I'm not direly pessimistic about this team, not yet. I like Robin, I respect what he went through as a player and all he did to get to where he is today. I want to give him the chance to win out. I'm not going to pretend going sub .500 again makes me happy."
whitesox,3758i2,ricker182,2,Mon May 25 03:07:43 2015 UTC,Basketball teams can be carried by one player. Baseball definitely can't. That's not a good analogy.
whitesox,3758i2,ACSimeon,1 point,Mon May 25 15:06:19 2015 UTC,"I chose that analogy because both teams were completely retooled in the off-season and both had mediocre starts. This team can't be carried by one player, but this team is capable of playing much better than they have been. Like I'm saying, if Robin can't turn this around he should be fired. If Blatt (with help from the Front Office) hadn't turned the Cavs season around, he probably would have been fired."
whitesox,3758i2,captain_kindness,2,Mon May 25 15:24:31 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with you. It's tough to compare basketball and baseball, but from a managerial perspective they are similar. Thanks for clarifying.     I also agree this team is much better on paper than they are playing. Who knows if that will translate to wins or not, but this team should certainly be able to score more runs. They're 2nd to last in MLB in RPG."
whitesox,3758i2,_Rooster_,1 point,Mon May 25 15:58:53 2015 UTC,"I realize we've got Noesi vs. Hutchinson on the mound today, but if we can get some wins again it'll put an end to the fire Robin talk for a while.   If things get really dire before August or we miss the playoffs, I promise you, I will post a ""FIRE ROBIN NOW"" thread.  But no, this shouldn't be his last road trip."
whitesox,3758i2,whitesox20051,2,Mon May 25 16:06:32 2015 UTC,It needs to happen. Am I confident in it happening? Hell no.

whitesox,3758i2,epictrole,1 point,Mon May 25 05:03:05 2015 UTC,If it does happen I would like for it to happen at the end of the year.  Robin has been good to the organization and the organization has been good to him and he is also well liked by the fans.  Make the firing low key and respectable because I think it would benefit everyone that way.

In all seriousness, I don't think Robin is a good manager but I doubt a change would help the team.

LaRoche and Melky were never meant to be building, theyre here to fill needs over the next couple of years as they help the Sox compete, as the Sox develop replacements at the minors. I don't think anyone in the right mind considered 35 year old LaRoche to be a building block going forward when the Sox signed him. Your building blocks for the next few years are Eaton, Abreu, Sale, Q, Rodon, Avi not 30 something Melky and LaRoche.  And you're being really knee-jerky in regards to Eaton, the guy had a 5.5 WAR last year and if I'm not mistaken only Trout had a better one amongst CFs in the AL. Yeah he did get off to a slow start but so didbthe entire team, plus ever since he came back from the flu hes been hitting the ball pretty well."

whitesox,370e1v,america_rex,3,Sat May 23 19:00:55 2015 UTC,It's not a White Sox thing its an MLB thing. They started them last year in Minnesota and were expanded to everywhere at the start of this season.  Also I agree it's ridiculous they slow entering the stadium down to a crawl and absolutely no one is trying to bring in any weapons.

whitesox,370e1v,america_rex,1 point,Sat May 23 22:13:42 2015 UTC,I'm a bit surprised by that since according to this article they implemented them at every park starting this season. I could see where with the construction they might not have had time to put them up there though.

whitesox,36xl4h,ricker182,4,Sat May 23 03:17:04 2015 UTC,Maybe we should stop signing 30-something 1B/DH types named Adam that used to play for the Nationals. Just a suggestion.

I'm kind of torn on these issues; while I think it's complete BS that the people's car was getting pissed on, Sox security can't be everywhere, all the time.  If anyone should get sued, it should be the A-holes who were pissing on the car.  Unfortunately, I think the people/company with the deeper pockets are getting the short stick on this one......"
whitesox,36xl4h,mycrows,1 point,Sat May 23 02:19:33 2015 UTC,The Giants fan who was beaten up in a Dodgers parking lot a few years ago got millions from the team. Sounds like this couple is asking for a lot less than that. I guess it'll come down to how negligent Sox security was.

whitesox,36xl4h,chocoholicsoxfan,1 point,Sat May 23 02:14:59 2015 UTC,Maybe it's time for Alexei to change the pronunciation of his name again. I think he does that when he's not hitting.
whitesox,36xl4h,ricker182,1 point,Sat May 23 02:17:53 2015 UTC,We're the worst 2 games under .500 team ever I think.     I have no idea how we even won games.     The only good thing we have is our bullpen. Somehow.

whitesox,36yocj,funkytownsz,1 point,Sat May 23 13:38:53 2015 UTC,I might just have to wait until you pick from now on and make my picks off of that if I want to catch you.  Today's picks were easy in my mind (when you have 2 aces going like that).
whitesox,36yocj,AnDEErew,2,Sat May 23 13:43:13 2015 UTC,"Haha playing a dangerous game then.  I was very tempted to go Padres, but with Dodgers at home and guy who's been pitching well on the mound, had to go with Dodgers."
whitesox,36yocj,EvilFefe,2,Sat May 23 13:51:07 2015 UTC,"I know that.  I am not saying I would go completely against my gut, but if there is a close matchup or two and I think you could end up wrong, I just might take the chance.  It is a dangerous way to do it, but I do have to pick different than you to catch up with you."

whitesox,36wtcb,DomCaboose,2,Sat May 23 13:25:42 2015 UTC,"Absolutely sir,  though my roommate lost it between my two college apartments. Thats what I get for trusting him lol"
whitesox,36wtcb,the_cro,2,Sat May 23 13:54:47 2015 UTC,Ouch.  That really sucks you lost it.  I can't wait for today.  I guarantee you I am going to cry.
whitesox,36wtcb,DomCaboose,2,Sat May 23 14:01:53 2015 UTC,Yeah! I've been to all the statue games so far.   After this one I can't possibly imagine whose number they're going to honor
whitesox,36wtcb,the_cro,1 point,Sat May 23 14:33:05 2015 UTC,"Well, I can't think of any because we don't have too many old guys anymore honestly.  Look at how young our team is compared to previous years.  Look at who we have.  Sale, Shark, Quintana, Rodon, Danks, Abreu, Sanchez, Ramirez (one of the older guys, but he is also above average and not a star, still love the guy though), Melky, Eaton, Avi.  Even in the bullpen our team is really young.  I don't see them doing anything for anyone for a long while unfortunately."
whitesox,36wtcb,DomCaboose,2,Sat May 23 14:40:17 2015 UTC,gates don't open until 1:10. I'm aiming for 1:00

whitesox,36wtcb,DomCaboose,2,Sat May 23 13:25:56 2015 UTC,2 hours before I believe. 3:10 game so 1:10 gates
whitesox,36wtcb,TheMagicalDonkey,1 point,Sat May 23 13:47:42 2015 UTC,Okay.  I should be there are 1:30 so I think I should be okay.  I really just want the 2 statues (both the wife and I are going) because I missed the statue for Thomas and I will be super sad if I miss this one.
whitesox,36wtcb,DomCaboose,2,Sat May 23 13:54:55 2015 UTC,"20,000 so I think we have a shot. I live next to Wrigley and sell their giveaways on eBay (already sold Konerko fir $35 paying for 1/2 of my pick 7 plan!) and their 10k items last for an hour hour and a half. Might do 1:30 like you to avoid initial cluster"
whitesox,36wtcb,TheMagicalDonkey,1 point,Sat May 23 14:02:20 2015 UTC,"I think you should.  I am taking the train so that is the earliest I could get up there today, otherwise I would be up there at 11:30. So what you already sold the statue on ebay?  Is that what you mean?"
whitesox,36wtcb,DomCaboose,2,Sat May 23 14:10:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah did a presale and sold it fast. Trying to pay off my pick 7 plan. I lucked out and got this game before they excluded it from offers. Also got the Saturday cubs game, red Sox, and cardinals. Great deal for $65!"
whitesox,36wtcb,TheMagicalDonkey,2,Sat May 23 15:11:33 2015 UTC,I did a pick 7 plan and did the same for this one.  That was the biggest reason I did the pick 7.  I am so glad that I got the tickets for today.  Where are you sitting today? I am in section 149.
whitesox,36wtcb,DomCaboose,1 point,Sat May 23 15:35:37 2015 UTC,"I'm in the boonies, 506. The pick 7 tix allow lower level access so last game I just sat in the outfield. This game being sold out I'll probably sit in my seats."

whitesox,36u5d1,chocoholicsoxfan,3,Fri May 22 03:48:54 2015 UTC,DemoteTyler
whitesox,36u5d1,AnniesBoobzz,2,Fri May 22 03:58:04 2015 UTC,I didn't watch the whole game. He had two RBI's how did he fuck up? (Serious question)
whitesox,36u5d1,freshapepper,2,Fri May 22 04:03:50 2015 UTC,"Well he hit a two-run homer in the ninth when the game was already over, but he's just bad offensively (see .207 average and .548 OPS), and his defense is nowhere near as good as it was last year."
whitesox,36u5d1,AnniesBoobzz,2,Fri May 22 04:21:19 2015 UTC,"C'mon now. Tyler was the least of our problems in this one. I really don't get why he's a scapegoat for so many of our issues in this sub. I mean, the guy's not great, but he's not responsible for nearly as much of the bad stuff as people on this sub like to blame him for. And his intangibles, like pitch framing, are a hell of a lot better than anyone else we've had up recently, be that Phegley, Soto, or Nieto."
whitesox,36u5d1,chocoholicsoxfan,1 point,Fri May 22 05:39:44 2015 UTC,"I'm talking about way more than just this game. There's other flaws of course, but the guy just can't hit ever, and his defense is nowhere near where it was last year. He's an excellent pitch framer but that is just one aspect to catching. Wouldn't be surprised if he ends up hitting under the Mendoza line with a less than 25 caught stealing %"
whitesox,36u5d1,AnniesBoobzz,1 point,Fri May 22 06:16:06 2015 UTC,"Sure, but the thing is there are no viable alternatives that would be any better available at this point. And Alexei has been almost as bad lately, but he hasn't been getting nearly as much flack."
whitesox,36u5d1,chocoholicsoxfan,2,Fri May 22 06:27:51 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I hate watching people steal on Tyler with impunity but I don't really want to see Kottaras, Nieto or Soto behind the plate (or hitting) either.  Fans are probably going easy on Alexei because of his pattern of improving as the weather warms up. If he keeps hitting terribly for another month, I'd expect the backlash to materialize."
whitesox,36u5d1,mycrows,1 point,Fri May 22 14:38:04 2015 UTC,"I've definitely been just as upset with Alexei, so I agree with you there. And I agree there might not be a better option, but I don't see the harm in calling up Smith or Kottaras to see how they do."
whitesox,36u5d1,AnniesBoobzz,2,Fri May 22 06:45:59 2015 UTC,So like... The only reason Danks is still in the starting rotation is because of the contract right? Like if he were a 2.5 mil per year player he wouldn't be in the rotation.
whitesox,36u5d1,freshapepper,2,Fri May 22 03:58:54 2015 UTC,"We CAN'T just ""trade"" Danks."
whitesox,36u5d1,chocoholicsoxfan,1 point,Fri May 22 04:27:10 2015 UTC,"It would definitely take some crazy logistical work-around, but you understand why that is the best-case scenario. The Cardinals decide Yadier Molina is on the decline and they can save Danks career (and need to because Wainwright is out). I'm not trying to argue the fact: The odds of this happening are 1 in a 1,000,000,000.   (edit: added another 3 zeros because I felt the odds weren't even 1 in a million)."
whitesox,36u5d1,ACSimeon,2,Fri May 22 21:36:29 2015 UTC,"Oh well yeah I mean I want Danks gone as bad as anyone else. I just know it's not feasible and he has to be in the rotation, so when people blame Hahn or Robin for that it upsets me. But now I realize you're not doing that."
whitesox,36u5d1,chocoholicsoxfan,1 point,Fri May 22 21:43:05 2015 UTC,"I blame Kenny Williams for signing him to such an imprudent contract, but that's a sunken cost now. We're trying to do the best we can with him, and that's really all we can do for now. I still love this team to bounce back before the All-Star Break, and really crush after it."
whitesox,36u5d1,ACSimeon,2,Fri May 22 21:58:35 2015 UTC,"I've said it before. Hindsight is 20/20. No one can predict injury. These things happen.  At the end of the day, it's just a game."
whitesox,36u5d1,chocoholicsoxfan,2,Fri May 22 22:02:08 2015 UTC,How do they expect fans to show up to games if the offense stays home?

He would start 162/5 times, so let's say 32 starts. In his last start, he threw 106 pitches, so let's use that number, though it's quite higher than average, which will skew the numbers.   14,250,000 ÷ 32 ÷106 = about $4200 (!) PER PITCH.

Since a state cannot afford to track the many individuals who do business on an itinerant basis, the ones targeted are usually very wealthy and high profile, namely professional athletes. Not only are the working schedules of famous sports players public, so are their salaries. The state can compute and collect the amount with very little investment of time and effort.

whitesox,36szp1,EvilFefe,6,Thu May 21 21:44:34 2015 UTC,Take the Metra Rock Island line to 35th/Bronzeville/IIT stop. Then walk a block to the stadium. I would just double check the schedule for night game
whitesox,36szp1,HaltxHammerZeit,4,Thu May 21 21:50:36 2015 UTC,Wow. A lot simpler than getting to Wrigley by train.
whitesox,36szp1,classic__schmosby,2,Thu May 21 22:00:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I went to Elvis night last year, and because of the impersonator/fireworks show we ended up missing a train by about 5 minutes. It was an hour until the next one. At least we weren't alone at the station, as pretty much everyone did the same thing we did."
whitesox,36szp1,DomCaboose,2,Thu May 21 22:28:30 2015 UTC,"Yes.  The Metra from Rock Island line.  I would honestly suggest taking the train from New Lenox rather than from Joliet.  I like it better even if you might be closer to the Joliet station.  It is $1.25 to park at the New Lenox station and then on the weekends it is $8 for a round trip and weekdays are $7.    Off of the Sox website:     Weekend/Holiday Games - An extra inbound train will arrive approximately 45 minutes prior to the scheduled first pitch for 1:10 p.m. starts. A post-game train will depart outbound to Joliet approximately 30 minutes after the game. For all 6:10 p.m. starts, regularly scheduled inbound trains will have additional capacity. A post-game train will depart outbound to Joliet approximately 30 minutes after the game/fireworks making stops at Gresham, Blue Island and all stops to Joliet.     Other than the weekend, I usually just check the regular train schedule to figure out which train I want to take (if I want to get there earlier)."
whitesox,36szp1,DomCaboose,3,Fri May 22 00:56:21 2015 UTC,$7 round trip. God damn why do I drive to the cell
whitesox,36szp1,DomCaboose,2,Fri May 22 01:00:14 2015 UTC,"That's on the weekend.  Even during the week it is only a $14 round trip, which isn't bad.  That's cheaper than parking alone.  I started taking the train to and from games and I live in Minooka.  I know how you feel  It is so much better taking the train."
whitesox,36qb55,Spaaace_Ghooost,4,Thu May 21 07:26:38 2015 UTC,"right now, the hitting woes is THE PROBLEM for this team....and with players they have it shouldn't be. The mental part of hitting is pretty significant and some how the hitters have to become more aggressive in their approach.  Opposing pitchers are throwing a lot of strikes that the batters are taking with many out over the plate in what would be consider in their ""zone""......nothing worse that constantly having 2 strikes on you."
whitesox,36qb55,decaturbob,1 point,Thu May 21 11:06:56 2015 UTC,"yeah, I wonder if coaching is the issue: Connor's 'approach' in that 9th inning at bat  yesterday probably could have been better"
whitesox,36qb55,ParkerAdderson,1 point,Thu May 21 15:24:30 2015 UTC,"Opposing pitchers pretty much know they can throw a fastball down the middle of the plate on the first pitch and the Sox hitters are not going to swing the majority of the time. Call me old school, but when you are hitting...you are looking at a particular pitch in your zone whether its first pitch or not....the Sox hitters clearly do not."
whitesox,36qb55,decaturbob,0,Thu May 21 21:21:27 2015 UTC,yea i turned the game off after his weak pop-out on the friggin first pitch
whitesox,36qb55,sobieski84,2,Thu May 21 18:04:04 2015 UTC,"Probably because the only players with higher slugging percentages right now that are not below last year's are Beckham, Avasail Garcia(he was hurt most of last season, but his slugging percentage is higher than Viciedo's from last year).  Melky's only slugging .294, below De Aza's .354 and Viciedo's .405.  EDIT: These percentages are a couple days old, but are only different by a couple points.  Bonafacio is slugging .216, when Moses Sierra and Semien slugged .417 and .372 respectively.  And then we get to the DH...Laroche's slugging percentage of .363 is a lot lower than Dunn's .433.  Fun fact: Abreu finished last year with 14 GIDP. This year he already has 8."
whitesox,36qb55,OandAlifer,1 point,Thu May 21 09:16:35 2015 UTC,"I am alright with the team having a lower slugging % but they have in no way made up for the lack of power. They have no speed, last in steals. The only person with more than 1 steal all season is Micah Johnson and he's gone. Average and OBP is the same, despite getting rid of the likes of Dunn and Viciedo, so they aren't getting into scoring position. And then when they do, they ground out (which the GO/AO ratio is among the highest in the league). What is causing them to hit so many grounders?  Obviously, the team has players who can hit hard, they just arent getting it into the air. Is it just a team funk or perhaps is it the coaching staff (specifically hitting) that is getting them into these bad habits, or is it something else (weather, bad luck, Ozzie's revenge)?"
whitesox,36qb55,Mrslinger85,1 point,Thu May 21 10:00:55 2015 UTC,"I'm hating the lack of clutch hits too.  A lot of guys are getting on base only to be stranded.  Like, to put up 10 hits and only have a run or two to show for it is infuriating."

He doesn't want a repeat of last season when he went for a fuck ton of homers in the first half & cooled off in the second half. He's on a 15 game hitting streak tho."
whitesox,36qb55,crpav,6,Thu May 21 12:55:55 2015 UTC,"Hahaha, sorry nothing personal but you don't come out and ""pace"" yourself and try to hit or not hit home runs. You come to hit and help your team win and right now that is not happening."
whitesox,36qb55,Mrslinger85,4,Thu May 21 14:15:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it feels like he's not doing well, then I look and he's batting .293 with a .365 OBP.  Crazyness."
whitesox,36qb55,crpav,1 point,Thu May 21 14:45:09 2015 UTC,"I know. I was surprised to see his average that high for how ""bad"" he has been hitting lately. I am sure he will pick it up but right now it's tough seeing him, and the team, struggle so much with their hitting."
whitesox,36qb55,Mrslinger85,1 point,Thu May 21 14:51:21 2015 UTC,"Yep.  Agreed.  I know LaRoche is streaky, and that Alexi generally is pretty bad for the first few months, but I feel like this team is so close to being really good.  Its just so frustrating to see the pitching, especially the relief, go to waste."
whitesox,36qb55,lostmessage256,3,Thu May 21 15:52:18 2015 UTC,he hit less home runs later in the year but made up for it by hitting .350 in the second half.

whitesox,36otc1,Mrslinger85,2,Thu May 21 02:28:08 2015 UTC,I missed it.
whitesox,36otc1,ricker182,6,Thu May 21 02:29:41 2015 UTC,We'll never win with Robin. Just saying. That was an obvious situation where Jennings doesn't have anything in a close ballgame and he just throws the fucking game away.
whitesox,36otc1,ricker182,7,Thu May 21 02:44:02 2015 UTC,That was a REALLY BAD at bat 0/10.
whitesox,36otc1,ricker182,3,Thu May 21 03:37:29 2015 UTC,Would not watch again.
whitesox,36otc1,DomCaboose,4,Thu May 21 03:38:35 2015 UTC,fans look miserable out there. grab a drink and cheer up!

whitesox,36otc1,arsesox,2,Wed May 20 23:57:10 2015 UTC,But..... It's a four game series?
whitesox,36otc1,fir_reunion,4,Wed May 20 23:58:36 2015 UTC,Well... Can't win the series without winning today!

whitesox,36otc1,fir_reunion,4,Thu May 21 00:06:58 2015 UTC,This no hitter until the forth inning shit is really getting annoying guys. Other teams get hits in the first inning. Why can't we??
whitesox,36otc1,heavykevy1983,4,Thu May 21 00:58:04 2015 UTC,I was watching a shitty stream for the of the game before I realized that it's on Channel My50.
whitesox,36otc1,NineduceXII,6,Thu May 21 01:00:10 2015 UTC,I'm getting tired of watching Alexei pop up with runners on base..
whitesox,36otc1,samurai5625,2,Thu May 21 01:59:01 2015 UTC,"I feel like he hasn't gotten a hit this year.  I know that isn't true, but I cannot remember any particular one."
whitesox,36otc1,crak6389,4,Thu May 21 02:13:49 2015 UTC,Eaton would have somehow scored on that.  And I would have liked to see Bacon in this at bat.

whitesox,36otc1,sevelev711,3,Thu May 21 01:49:23 2015 UTC,We should be able to hit Marcum. He's no where near the level of Kluber or Bauer.
whitesox,36otc1,ricker182,3,Thu May 21 00:58:15 2015 UTC,Hawk and Stone are getting all deep and introspective tonight. I like it.
whitesox,36otc1,DannyDuDiggle,5,Thu May 21 01:12:32 2015 UTC,I want to know what came out when Hawk sat down with the psychologist.

whitesox,36otc1,ricker182,3,Thu May 21 01:30:47 2015 UTC,No excuse for not being able to hit Marcum.
whitesox,36otc1,ricker182,3,Thu May 21 02:05:21 2015 UTC,Got really lucky the weather kept that in.
whitesox,36otc1,ArtisticGuy,2,Thu May 21 02:18:56 2015 UTC,Big time!
whitesox,36otc1,DomCaboose,3,Thu May 21 02:19:02 2015 UTC,Awesome.  Rodon got through 6 and got the quality start.  Let's get this bat's working for Christ sake!

whitesox,36otc1,ricker182,2,Thu May 21 00:45:44 2015 UTC,Why doesn't Alexei ever keep the tag on?  Someone needs to tell him that. Unacceptable.

whitesox,36otc1,MustacheMark,2,Thu May 21 01:34:03 2015 UTC,Gotta stop walking them Rodon.
whitesox,36otc1,dhcrazy333,2,Thu May 21 01:34:19 2015 UTC,Just tuned in. Good to see Rodon's pitch count relatively low for how far he is in the game. Must be throwing strikes finally yes?  Edit: 4 walks. Not good. Surprised he had a relatively good pitch count through 5.
whitesox,36otc1,ricker182,2,Thu May 21 01:37:05 2015 UTC,Just put them on 2nd base of they make it to first. Makes no difference.
whitesox,36otc1,bababooey55,1 point,Thu May 21 01:51:42 2015 UTC,I feel like Tyler's defense has really regressed this year. Despite being a shitty hitter he was at least reliable behind the plate before but he's not even that this year.
whitesox,36otc1,ricker182,2,Thu May 21 02:06:08 2015 UTC,Anyone notice Rodon hasn't gotten one close pitch called in his favor?
whitesox,36otc1,bababooey55,1 point,Thu May 21 02:15:03 2015 UTC,Been like that in each one of his starts. He's getting squeezed like crazy. I don't get it.
whitesox,36otc1,ricker182,2,Thu May 21 02:09:36 2015 UTC,Really disappointed with this offensive effort we're showing.
whitesox,36otc1,NineduceXII,1 point,Thu May 21 02:12:15 2015 UTC,Total of 4 runs this whole series so far. It's looking like the start of the year.
whitesox,36otc1,ricker182,2,Thu May 21 02:18:43 2015 UTC,I'll give them a pass vs Kluber and Bauer but not Marcum.

whitesox,36otc1,ricker182,2,Thu May 21 02:27:32 2015 UTC,I thought it was a picture or something.

whitesox,36otc1,DomCaboose,2,Thu May 21 02:35:30 2015 UTC,What the heck Jennings.  My 3 year old could throw more accurate than that.
whitesox,36otc1,ricker182,2,Thu May 21 02:36:15 2015 UTC,Cmon Robin he obviously doesn't have it today.
whitesox,36otc1,NineduceXII,2,Thu May 21 02:36:37 2015 UTC,It's been walk city tonight. 3-0 every at bat.
whitesox,36otc1,ricker182,1 point,Thu May 21 02:40:58 2015 UTC,That's the approach we need. Marcum doesn't throw many strikes and Bauer yesterday only threw 1 in 3 innings.
whitesox,36otc1,Mrslinger85,1 point,Thu May 21 02:41:08 2015 UTC,Rodon walked a lot
whitesox,36otc1,ChiTownSox,2,Thu May 21 02:41:59 2015 UTC,no clue. when you see a guy struggling like that you gotta pull the plug
whitesox,36otc1,ricker182,2,Thu May 21 02:51:26 2015 UTC,Because Robin... That's why. Fucking ridiculous.
whitesox,36otc1,ricker182,2,Thu May 21 02:41:26 2015 UTC,Thanks Robin.
whitesox,36otc1,NineduceXII,2,Thu May 21 02:43:57 2015 UTC,Thanks Robin. This is your fault. Should've removed him after walk 1. Now they have 3 runs because of your incompetence. #FireRobin.
whitesox,36otc1,ACSimeon,1 point,Thu May 21 02:46:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they should have pulled Jennings. I like that they gave him some leash. They're not trying to fuck up his confidence, they like him as the seventh-inning setup guy."
whitesox,36otc1,Mrslinger85,2,Thu May 21 02:43:03 2015 UTC,This is not a team we should be losing to.
whitesox,36otc1,ChiTownSox,3,Thu May 21 02:44:07 2015 UTC,or the pitcher. nothing against the guy but cmon

whitesox,36otc1,ricker182,2,Thu May 21 02:52:51 2015 UTC,I really hope Jennings figures it out soon because our bullpen is still nasty.

whitesox,36otc1,chocoholicsoxfan,2,Thu May 21 03:37:48 2015 UTC,Question: why not have Beckham pinch hit?
whitesox,36otc1,dhcrazy333,4,Thu May 21 03:37:52 2015 UTC,Because Robin doesn't know how to manage and probably wanted the lefty vs righty matchup instead of the better hitter matchup.

whitesox,36otc1,ricker182,1 point,Thu May 21 02:10:05 2015 UTC,Which is weird because his control is what was highly touted outside of his slider.

whitesox,36otc1,NineduceXII,1 point,Thu May 21 02:14:54 2015 UTC,Man. Rodon is a walk machine.

whitesox,36otc1,ricker182,1 point,Thu May 21 02:17:32 2015 UTC,He's giving Marcum every close pitch.

whitesox,36otc1,bababooey55,1 point,Thu May 21 02:34:59 2015 UTC,Welp. Shit.
whitesox,36otc1,NineduceXII,1 point,Thu May 21 02:35:36 2015 UTC,Were gonna lose because of walks. Why does this always happen to us.
whitesox,36otc1,bababooey55,2,Thu May 21 02:37:00 2015 UTC,Not being able to hit a mediocre pitcher hasn't exactly helped us either.
whitesox,36otc1,ricker182,1 point,Thu May 21 02:38:53 2015 UTC,Because. White Sox.
whitesox,36otc1,ricker182,1 point,Thu May 21 02:38:59 2015 UTC,Here's the Sox team I know. They went into hiding for a few games.

whitesox,36otc1,ricker182,1 point,Thu May 21 02:46:14 2015 UTC,With the way our hitters look I think this one is all but over.
whitesox,36otc1,ACSimeon,1 point,Thu May 21 02:52:06 2015 UTC,maybe they're all just due to hit a shitload of runs.
whitesox,36otc1,ricker182,1 point,Thu May 21 02:52:10 2015 UTC,Maybe if it were warmer.
whitesox,36otc1,bababooey55,1 point,Thu May 21 02:56:23 2015 UTC,Need some pinch hitters. Bottom of the lineup blows ass right now.

whitesox,36ps6t,epictrole,3,Thu May 21 04:03:46 2015 UTC,"It's Ventura's (pardon my french) retarded old school style. ""Oh, I have a lefty on the bench - he'll  definitely get a hit against a righty."" He does the same thing with pitchers... sometimes you need to be unconventional, not so predictable, and just go with the hot hand."
whitesox,36nols,whitesox20051,6,Wed May 20 18:35:26 2015 UTC,"His K/BB ratio is still kind of abysmal; he needs to develop some discipline, but there's no questioning his hand-eye coordination that's for sure."
whitesox,36nols,WSOXFAN22,2,Wed May 20 20:37:59 2015 UTC,This. And how is his defense? That is the most important part of his position.
whitesox,36nols,ggslovin,2,Wed May 20 21:25:26 2015 UTC,"He's very athletic; he's just incredibly raw at the position. His footwork is still a work in progress, but he has the range and the arm to play short; his hands are considered a +, which is a bonus.  His lack of baseball reps in his life is very noticeable; that's what has led to his over aggressiveness at the plate, and his lack of fundamentals at short. His athleticism can't be questioned. When he hits the ball, he makes very good contact as well; which is clear based on his career BABIP numbers in the minors.   Patience will come with experience, and hopefully the consistency at short will as well."
whitesox,36nols,WSOXFAN22,1 point,Wed May 20 22:12:03 2015 UTC,"This is why I'm happy if we don't see him in Chicago until 2017, maybe a cup of coffee in 2016. Anderson has huge upside, but like you said, he's raw and really needs the baseball reps. Though with two years of control for Alexei Ramirez, plus a handful of other temporary options in the system, the Sox have no need to rush Anderson."

whitesox,36k0mt,ChiTownSox,3,Wed May 20 00:16:00 2015 UTC,surprised they did not appeal there. okay with me!
whitesox,36k0mt,Menkib,4,Wed May 20 00:34:22 2015 UTC,Lets get 10 in a row
whitesox,36k0mt,ACSimeon,2,Wed May 20 00:36:45 2015 UTC,Let's roll right to the top of the division and stay there.
whitesox,36k0mt,thom_weights,5,Wed May 20 00:42:08 2015 UTC,Let's never lose again
whitesox,36k0mt,TheHoneyBadger23,4,Wed May 20 00:47:55 2015 UTC,I don't like how this game is flowing....just seems like they're getting hits and we're......not.
whitesox,36k0mt,ACSimeon,3,Wed May 20 00:44:59 2015 UTC,Wait until the Bauer is facing batters for the second or third time.

whitesox,36k0mt,mycrows,2,Wed May 20 01:18:01 2015 UTC,You called it. Too bad we couldn't make more out of it.
whitesox,36k0mt,sevelev711,3,Wed May 20 01:22:44 2015 UTC,"Alexi, why you gotta do so many Alexi things?"
whitesox,36k0mt,Cheeky_buggah,4,Wed May 20 01:24:22 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest I was heavy in the Micah camp after spring training,  but Sanchez seems to be so much more polished as a professional"
whitesox,36k0mt,bababooey55,2,Wed May 20 01:40:02 2015 UTC,Same. Wasn't totally sure about sending Micah down and bringing Carlos up but I understood it and had no problem with it. Now I'm absolutely seeing why Sanchez is in the bigs.
whitesox,36k0mt,thom_weights,4,Wed May 20 02:09:09 2015 UTC,Nice work Q!

whitesox,36k0mt,dhcrazy333,5,Wed May 20 02:20:24 2015 UTC,When do we ever score runs for Q-Bert? I feel like it's once in a blue moon.
whitesox,36k0mt,Rubentraj,3,Wed May 20 02:24:56 2015 UTC,Time for the regular 8/9 inning heart attack
whitesox,36k0mt,NineduceXII,4,Wed May 20 02:47:22 2015 UTC,Looks like we're headed back to 500.
whitesox,36k0mt,Mrslinger85,4,Wed May 20 02:56:36 2015 UTC,"Thats fine. Just this is a game they should have won. You cant take a start like Q had and blow it away. But hey, this has been a nice streak."
whitesox,36k0mt,ACSimeon,1 point,Wed May 20 03:00:38 2015 UTC,Not if Alexei & Killespie can make some noise.  And Cody Allen has a 7+ ERA. We can ding him for 2 or 3.
whitesox,36k0mt,Cheeky_buggah,3,Wed May 20 03:03:15 2015 UTC,White Sox
whitesox,36k0mt,TheHoneyBadger23,3,Wed May 20 00:05:36 2015 UTC,"As a UW grad, I LOVE that Hawk's talking about Kaminsky haha"
whitesox,36k0mt,NineduceXII,3,Wed May 20 00:56:44 2015 UTC,I'm getting flashbacks to yesterday. This seems like it's the same game. Just less strike outs.
whitesox,36k0mt,crak6389,3,Wed May 20 00:58:38 2015 UTC,"Hitz, plz."
whitesox,36k0mt,crak6389,3,Wed May 20 01:06:50 2015 UTC,Thnx!

whitesox,36k0mt,sevelev711,3,Wed May 20 01:10:57 2015 UTC,I'm curious to see the amount of runs the Sox have with 2 outs vs 1 or 0. Anyone know a quick way to find out?
whitesox,36k0mt,DomCaboose,2,Wed May 20 01:11:19 2015 UTC,You might be able to find it on baseballreference.com.  I don't know for sure though.

whitesox,36k0mt,DomCaboose,3,Wed May 20 01:20:49 2015 UTC,"Bad strikeout, but Alexei, but everyone is looking confident and happy."

whitesox,36k0mt,Mrslinger85,2,Wed May 20 01:44:49 2015 UTC,Damn. Its exactly what i thought it was. Nothing crazy or interesting.
whitesox,36k0mt,crak6389,3,Wed May 20 01:52:12 2015 UTC,"Outz, plz."
whitesox,36k0mt,DomCaboose,3,Wed May 20 01:50:49 2015 UTC,Avi coming up clutch.  God I love that guy.
whitesox,36k0mt,dhcrazy333,4,Wed May 20 02:04:38 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't exactly call grounding it back to the pitcher clutch, but it was a good hustle to take advantage of the bad throw."
whitesox,36k0mt,DomCaboose,2,Wed May 20 02:06:31 2015 UTC,"That's my point.  Anyone could have easily jogged, but he still beat it out and made a bad defense look even worse."
whitesox,36k0mt,dhcrazy333,5,Wed May 20 02:07:47 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna call it the Eaton Effect, because Eaton is pure hustle, and it's contagious."

whitesox,36k0mt,TheHoneyBadger23,3,Wed May 20 02:32:03 2015 UTC,I got curious so I went back and looked at Q's no decisions:  2015: T4th with 2  2014: T4th with 12  2013: 1st with 17
whitesox,36k0mt,chocoholicsoxfan,2,Wed May 20 02:31:22 2015 UTC,"For the length of time he's been pitching, I believe he has the most. But tonight looks like it'll be a loss."
whitesox,36k0mt,ACSimeon,2,Wed May 20 02:34:13 2015 UTC,Never doubt the White Sox propensity for late game heroics.
whitesox,36k0mt,chocoholicsoxfan,2,Wed May 20 02:38:13 2015 UTC,You're right. Tying run at the plate! JOSE JOSE JOSE JOSE JOOOSEEEE JOOOOSEEEE

whitesox,36k0mt,bababooey55,2,Wed May 20 03:24:00 2015 UTC,That's pretty damn incredible.
whitesox,36k0mt,bababooey55,3,Wed May 20 02:35:10 2015 UTC,What the fuck LaRoche. Dude....
whitesox,36k0mt,TheHoneyBadger23,3,Wed May 20 02:50:44 2015 UTC,Was I the only one wondering what the heck Jennings has inside his hat?
whitesox,36k0mt,heavykevy1983,2,Wed May 20 03:00:09 2015 UTC,Your not alone. Wonder what he was looking at/for?

whitesox,36k0mt,socklessmoejohnson,2,Tue May 19 23:38:57 2015 UTC,I can't watch the game 2nite being in the depths of southwest Scotland with very limited communal WiFi but let's fucking do this! We still owe the tribe an arsekicking for our 2013 record.
whitesox,36k0mt,heavykevy1983,2,Tue May 19 23:41:31 2015 UTC,Having trouble finding the strike zone are we??
whitesox,36k0mt,ricker182,2,Wed May 20 00:17:24 2015 UTC,Why are we not patient? Not one strike thrown yet.
whitesox,36k0mt,ACSimeon,2,Wed May 20 00:27:14 2015 UTC,It's okay. The comeback kids will strike again!
whitesox,36k0mt,heavykevy1983,2,Wed May 20 00:30:41 2015 UTC,1-0 ain't nothing!!!
whitesox,36k0mt,dhcrazy333,2,Wed May 20 00:32:45 2015 UTC,"Maybe Francona wants to save the challenge for later? Not sure why he didn't go for that one, I thought he was safe."
whitesox,36k0mt,Whoarofl,2,Wed May 20 00:34:45 2015 UTC,Does anyone have the link to the Ozzy rant of late September '05 that Hawk is referring to right now?
whitesox,36k0mt,TheHoneyBadger23,5,Wed May 20 00:48:26 2015 UTC,I just walked into the room when he was talking about it but I think this is it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG0X6wmVxVY
whitesox,36k0mt,Whoarofl,2,Wed May 20 00:54:20 2015 UTC,"Ah, not this but thanks. It was during the 2005 season, late, when Cleveland came within 1 1/2 games of the Whitesox, and the Whitesox started looking vulnerable during their dominate '05 season, and doubt started creeping in [the media] I guess Ozzy went on a big epic rant, taking blame, and shifting the media's attention from the players, to ozzy, pre and post game, helping the players according to Hawk and Stone."
whitesox,36k0mt,sevelev711,2,Wed May 20 01:05:38 2015 UTC,Changed flair to the new greatest thing ever. Let's go Sox.
whitesox,36k0mt,NineduceXII,2,Wed May 20 00:57:57 2015 UTC,Cancel the post-game show.

whitesox,36k0mt,DomCaboose,2,Wed May 20 01:10:23 2015 UTC,I just checked the box score and saw Garcia was back in.  I had to kind of just skim the first couple of live innings since I was working.  Glad to see him feeling good enough to play.

whitesox,36k0mt,DomCaboose,2,Wed May 20 01:37:46 2015 UTC,Bauer is losing some control.  Now is the time to strike!
whitesox,36k0mt,TheHoneyBadger23,2,Wed May 20 02:04:58 2015 UTC,The 7th was not ours! Conor guessed wrong....
whitesox,36k0mt,DannyDuDiggle,5,Wed May 20 02:07:30 2015 UTC,Wasn't that the 6th?

whitesox,36k0mt,bababooey55,2,Wed May 20 02:25:11 2015 UTC,Because Q is pitching.

whitesox,36k0mt,bababooey55,2,Wed May 20 02:44:43 2015 UTC,Quite bizarre that the manager and a pitcher would both have the same names if Jennings had stayed in Miami this year.
whitesox,36k0mt,crak6389,2,Wed May 20 02:59:48 2015 UTC,"Alright, we can do this!"
whitesox,36k0mt,NineduceXII,2,Wed May 20 03:02:32 2015 UTC,If we lose then both the Cubs and Sox would have their winning streak end at 6. Strange.
whitesox,36k0mt,Cheeky_buggah,2,Wed May 20 03:03:46 2015 UTC,Alexei and LaZero need to take a seat for a game or two

whitesox,36ko2j,crak6389,2,Wed May 20 20:08:15 2015 UTC,"I don't know if they still do it, but MLB Network used to mic up random players during spring training games (4 or 5 players) and would use just the sounds of the field and would have an announcer before and after commercial breaks. It would almost put me to sleep, not because it was boring, but because it was sooo relaxing."
whitesox,36ko2j,jrarms2,3,Wed May 20 22:14:39 2015 UTC,It could be them talking to producers on what's coming up or maybe what promotions they want to kill due to time. But unfortunately I think it's Stoney having trouble feeding off Hawk. Their roles should be switched IMO.
whitesox,36ko2j,jrarms2,7,Wed May 20 02:25:17 2015 UTC,"It just makes so much sense. When Stone fills in as the play-by-play he does really well, and Hawk's personality just screams color commentator."
whitesox,36ko2j,GenericCheesePuffs,4,Wed May 20 02:52:27 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. I just do not think it would work. Hawk is a camera whorre in the sense that he always takes control, spews his stories, his -isms, anecdotes etc. He's turned his -isms into how he does play by play, ""can of corn, duck snort, chopper 2 hopper,"" etc.  If it were up to Hawk, I'm sure he would just do it all alone - with no partner. I love him to death, but it's becoming nauseating"

Hawk is not the color commentator??"""
whitesox,36ko2j,mushperv,5,Wed May 20 20:05:09 2015 UTC,"I think stone just can't believe some of the shit that hawk spews and wants to argue with him. But he also knows hawk is going to be in that both until he dies, so if he wants to keep his job he just let's it go silent."

whitesox,36fd3w,DomCaboose,3,Tue May 19 02:47:00 2015 UTC,"Yea it was.  When you get dominant pitching like that, it happens.  No dilly dallying, no screwing around.  Just get to it."
whitesox,36fd3w,NineduceXII,17,Tue May 19 02:48:30 2015 UTC,"Man, if Eaton didn't do what he did then we would've came up with a goose egg."

whitesox,36fd3w,samlincoln,16,Tue May 19 01:56:20 2015 UTC,So Eaton put his massive balls on home plate?

whitesox,36fd3w,ricker182,7,Tue May 19 02:29:17 2015 UTC,My guess is opposing fans.

whitesox,36fd3w,DomCaboose,2,Tue May 19 00:16:53 2015 UTC,That was a big strikeout.
whitesox,36fd3w,pohodo3,4,Tue May 19 00:17:38 2015 UTC,Kluber is absolutely sick right now.  God damn.
whitesox,36fd3w,DomCaboose,6,Tue May 19 00:51:37 2015 UTC,Come on Sale! Lock down that strike zone.  It is yours. Own it.

whitesox,36fd3w,DomCaboose,6,Tue May 19 00:57:49 2015 UTC,Good way to end the inning Chris.  This is such a good game and we all have to remember how bad the bullpen of the Indians can be.  Hopefully the Sox can eat some pitches this inning and help drive up that pitch count.
whitesox,36fd3w,Cheeky_buggah,4,Tue May 19 01:19:39 2015 UTC,Alexei needs to be busting his ass down the line there.  Double plays suck.

whitesox,36fd3w,ricker182,5,Tue May 19 02:23:17 2015 UTC,Well shit. Not gonna lie that was actually a really good play.  Let's lock it down in the 10th and get at their bullpen.

whitesox,36fd3w,ricker182,6,Tue May 19 02:25:54 2015 UTC,Kluber more than 9 IP? When's the last time a starter has done that? CLE does like to pull him though.
whitesox,36fd3w,bababooey55,4,Tue May 19 02:26:04 2015 UTC,I feel like Pedro Martinez took a no-hitter into the 10th but gave up a hit first batter or something. Other than that I can't remember who.

whitesox,36fphi,Boopa1219,12,Tue May 19 00:58:07 2015 UTC,The manager doesn't make a 90 win team a 60 win team and vice versa. I think the importance of head coaching in the MLB is overstated.

whitesox,36fphi,Jruff1984,13,Tue May 19 16:21:03 2015 UTC,Let's ignore the past 3 years in favor of a 6 game winning streak.....
whitesox,36fphi,ricker182,9,Tue May 19 05:12:41 2015 UTC,"Exactly. This dude went thru like 8 people's posts from a month ago yesterday and asked then to eat their words, essentially, regarding Robin. You've been carrying the grudge that long, man? Who are you, Ventura's uncle?  Am I happy they have got back to a game over 500? Sure. But let's get things in perspective. They beat some shitty teams the last few weeks, and one winning streak doesn't eliminate the LAST THREE YEARS OF HORRIBLE MANAGERIAL DECISIONS!  Want me to start loving Robin as a manager? Tell him to stop being the guy who sacrifice bunts in the 4th inning but then doesn't when it's 1st and 2nd no one out in the 10th. Or maybe use Robertson for a 4-out save on 2 days rest instead of three pitchers to get one out like on Sunday."
whitesox,36fphi,mushperv,5,Tue May 19 13:45:53 2015 UTC,"I noticed this as well. It's absolutely unnecessary and, speaking for myself and not the other mods, not the kind of fan I want in this community."
whitesox,36fphi,mushperv,4,Tue May 19 14:43:27 2015 UTC,"It's just silly. I love this sub because fans are pretty smart and criticize when warranted.  I mean, who has time for that? Who remembers something like that a month later?"
whitesox,36fphi,mushperv,5,Tue May 19 16:33:12 2015 UTC,A bitter jerk. I tried to have a discussion with him and he resorted to mocking my sentence structure. I decided it wasn't worth having that discussion anymore.
whitesox,36fphi,mushperv,-2,Tue May 19 16:35:02 2015 UTC,"That sentence didn't make any sense, the way it was worded. But if you want to have a smart conversation about baseball (especially sabremetrics) then by all means but the majority of comments in that ""Robin needs to go"" thread was the exact antithesis of smart conversation, there were a couple smart comments made on both sides of the argument.

And if the Sox fired Robin, then they basically would be waving the white flag on the season.   And why is/was everyone so hard on Gardenhire as a potential replacment? That couldn't be a worst fit."

""They beat some shitty teams the last few weeks."" I thought good teams were supposed to take care of business against the bad ones.   And if you could manage better...."
whitesox,36fphi,MethMouthMagoo,1 point,Tue May 19 21:41:10 2015 UTC,"You realize Robin has made some horrible decisions before this year, right? And the team collapsed in 12? You act like one hot streak proves he's fucking Sparky Anderson.  And your whole ""you can't manage in the majors so you can't criticize"" is the absolute dumbest shit I've ever heard. The fact that you actually believe that makes you a horrible consumer of all things, not just sports. In short, your opinion about anything is invalid."
whitesox,36fphi,otherbarry2,0,Tue May 19 23:04:07 2015 UTC,"You're ignorant.   I never said that he's Sparky Anderson, this turnaround would not have been possible if Robin was fired. The team was bound to play better baseball, every team is going to go through a spell where they don't play well, the Sox had their's in April.  Like I have been saying, everyone needs to calm down and come back to their senses and start being reasonable.   And i never said, ""you can't manage in the majors so you can't criticize"". I said that if you think you know better or could do the job better than by all means criticize. I never said that you can't do anything."
whitesox,36fphi,samlincoln,2,Wed May 20 01:27:55 2015 UTC,"Not even that, but this winning streak has been against teams that are playing like shit.  It started with winning the last 2 against the Brewers (who were 12-23 after the last game we played them).  Then we swept the Athletics (putting them at 13-26 at the end of that series).  Then we just beat the Indians last night (14-23).  This isn't some huge turnaround masterminded by Robin Ventura.  This is the White Sox beating teams that are playing like the bottom of the barrel.  So now this moron is harassing users in this sub, basically trying to point out that they were wrong (check his history, he's been going onto posts from a month ago).  This guy is a fuckin' moron.  I'm not going to be happy until the Sox are actually beating good teams.  I'm not going to start throwing parties because they're beating shit teams.  /u/Boopa1219 needs to get a life."
whitesox,36fphi,otherbarry2,-1,Tue May 19 18:38:32 2015 UTC,"The past three years was a rebuilding situation, those were poor teams. You can't be serious when you say those were playoff caliber  teams"
whitesox,36fphi,ACSimeon,4,Tue May 19 06:25:10 2015 UTC,2012 was a rebuilding year? That was a collapse at the end of the season.       2013 wasn't a rebuilding year either.      Last year I'll let Ventura slide.
whitesox,36fphi,otherbarry2,2,Tue May 19 12:37:31 2015 UTC,"Robin was 100% to blame for the 2012 collapse. All his bullshit bunting and lefty lefty bullpen shit. Blew a 3 game lead with 15 to play, and they were basically out of it with 3 games to go. Maybe he deserves some credit for keeping the clubhouse loose but his in game management is still terrible. Stop god damn bunting, it's so stupid the one thing the defense is trying to do is get an out, and you're giving them an out"
whitesox,36fphi,ArtisticGuy,0,Tue May 19 15:43:06 2015 UTC,"The 2011 Sox finished 79-83 and actually played worst than that. And when Kenny announced the hire of Robin, he said that this is the beginning of a retooling project. The 2012 surprised a lot of people and got lucky towards the end of the season, that team failed because of its relieance on young pitching and those arms tired at the end and some bats got cold at the wrong time. People were picking the Sox to be one of the worst team in all of baseball before that season started.   How was 2013 not a rebuilding year, certainly you have to be realistic and look at that team. The 2013 Sox were not going to contend for anything. That was a team with a lot of dead weight. And you're not going to tell me that last year was not a building year."
whitesox,36fphi,otherbarry2,1 point,Tue May 19 21:31:11 2015 UTC,You're incredibly ignorant. Name one season in the past 20 where the Sox were billed as a rebuilding team.     Only one I can think of is last year.
whitesox,36fphi,otherbarry2,0,Wed May 20 00:17:32 2015 UTC,You're dumb.  The Sox can't call it rebuilding because fans will never show up at the stadium if that's the case. So they used proxy terms like retooling to take the place of the term rebuilding.  I listed examples of previous rebuilding years in another comment here.
whitesox,36fphi,MethMouthMagoo,1 point,Wed May 20 01:36:28 2015 UTC,Fans don't show up anyway. They don't have to declare it rebuilding. You can use your brain and 2013 wasn't a rebuilding year.

whitesox,36fphi,mushperv,3,Tue May 19 01:15:08 2015 UTC,"You know you can really like this turnaround without giving Robin credit for it, right?"
whitesox,36fphi,JustAnotherBoyScout,12,Tue May 19 13:46:47 2015 UTC,Sorry but this turn around has nothing to do with Robin. He's a bad manager and winning 5 games in a row doesn't change that. If anything it speaks to the talent on this club.
whitesox,36fphi,99levtt,-1,Tue May 19 01:51:57 2015 UTC,Why?
whitesox,36fphi,mushperv,8,Tue May 19 02:01:08 2015 UTC,Well for one he didn't bunt with no outs and runners on 1st and 2nd in the bottom of the 10th. He's lucky Sanchez bailed him out
whitesox,36fphi,99levtt,4,Tue May 19 02:48:48 2015 UTC,Who called up Sanchez to replace Johnson?

whitesox,36fphi,4cornerhustler,4,Tue May 19 03:09:15 2015 UTC,"Alexi can't bunt. Why would you bunt with a documented terrible bunter?  Sanchez bailed nobody out, Robin deserves as much credit for this win as Sale, Carlos, the pen, etc"

The only team no one thinks can compete with the other 4 is the Twins.  Rodon's Slider is straight up gangster."
whitesox,36eexj,ACSimeon,7,Mon May 18 20:43:43 2015 UTC,I'm not talking shit about the Twins unless we get above them in the standings.
whitesox,36eexj,socklessmoejohnson,2,Mon May 18 21:11:00 2015 UTC,The surprises in this division are the Twins overachieving & the Indians playing worse than us.
whitesox,36eexj,ACSimeon,2,Mon May 18 21:17:36 2015 UTC,I think this season will come down to if our pitchers can do better than the Tigers pitchers when we play each other. I think our rotation crushes theirs. It will be close throughout the season but Cleveland I don't trust enough and the Royals I have getting third in the division this year
whitesox,36eexj,ACSimeon,2,Mon May 18 20:51:33 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to underestimate the Royals, but yeah. We have all the tools."
whitesox,36eexj,SlagginOff,2,Mon May 18 20:58:04 2015 UTC,"If they're even in the playoff discussion come September, this season would probably be the most successful since 2008. I know that had decent runs that came up short in 2010 and 2012, but this is a young team that's built for the future, so a step forward with this team would be a bigger success than those seasons in my opinion."
whitesox,36eexj,ACSimeon,2,Tue May 19 14:46:26 2015 UTC,"I agree, but I also think bringing over Melky & LaRoche were win now moves."

whitesox,36dz36,imboredmuch,2,Mon May 18 20:46:32 2015 UTC,The Sox always have better prices than the Cubs.  The Cubs tickets are super expensive.
whitesox,36dz36,DomCaboose,1 point,Mon May 18 20:59:27 2015 UTC,Pretty much why I go to 4x the Sox games.

Here's the email that was sent to me:  Every Monday throughout the 2015 season, the White Sox will feature an upcoming game in which 200 tickets in select lower-level seating categories will be available for just $10. This week's game is Friday, May 22 against the Twins - and fans can begin purchasing tickets today at 5:00 PM CT. Get tickets for $10 and enjoy postgame fireworks presented by Magellan Corporation!  Offer Code: JOA136  This is kind of a crappy sale as I just tried it. The code definitely works. The only seats together are in the upper rows of the outfield. You may be able to do better on Stubhub."

whitesox,36d5rm,Cheeky_buggah,12,Mon May 18 13:08:22 2015 UTC,My dream booth would be Rowand and A.J.
whitesox,36d5rm,magooster,5,Mon May 18 14:49:38 2015 UTC,"Nothing against Rowand, but he lacks the pace the Stone displays to keep the action moving forward. Hawk uses silence effectively, and Stone knows how to work in and provide some good nuggets of information. I felt Rowand lacked some energy and it resulted in a dragging broadcast. Especially on Friday night when they started coming back."
whitesox,36d5rm,ElTunaGrande,1 point,Mon May 18 14:47:12 2015 UTC,"I thought Rowand provided some good insight but like you said, had some flaws in the overall flow of the broadcast.  He seemed to me to be a good 3rd guy on a broadcast after the primary analyst and play by play guy."
whitesox,36d5rm,HeadBanzMakeHerDance,-1,Mon May 18 16:42:46 2015 UTC,I wish Hawk used silence even more effectively.  As in permanently.
whitesox,36d5rm,4cornerhustler,1 point,Mon May 18 17:09:33 2015 UTC,"You're not allowed to talk negatively about Hawk, man. How dare you!"
whitesox,36d5rm,mushperv,3,Tue May 19 23:14:24 2015 UTC,"The tone of the article seems to suggest Stone is gonna be gone. AJ doesn't seem to be slowing down at all, so we could see them try a couple more guys in the booth"
whitesox,36d5rm,purplenightsky,2,Mon May 18 15:45:06 2015 UTC,I thought Rowand was much more at ease and even funny during Sunday's broadcast as compared to Saturday's broadcast. Steve Stone doesn't seem into being there at all. I'm not quite sure why he's there.
whitesox,36d5rm,The_Prowler,2,Mon May 18 17:12:17 2015 UTC,"As much as DJ and Farmer's chemistry has developed, I still really liked the Stone/Farmer combination.  I wouldn't mind Steve back on the radio broadcast in the slightest."
whitesox,36d5rm,mushperv,1 point,Tue May 19 13:46:35 2015 UTC,That would be awesome. Hate to lose Stone just because he and Hawk don't mesh.
whitesox,36d5rm,Slooper1140,1 point,Tue May 19 23:14:59 2015 UTC,"Another interesting topic from the same article:    And then there's Geovany Soto, who has had Sox fans wondering why he topples over when throwing the ball back to the pitcher. I've been asked numerous times as a P.O. Sox question, and I could never find a definitive answer. My best guess is the same thing BuehrleMan mentioned in 2013 when he first noticed Soto's habit -- that he had the yips at some point, and his double-clutch and dirt rub were actions that somehow took the focus off the task of returning the ball to the mound.  It caught Chavez's eye -- noting that Alexei Ramirez often took a step to back up the pitcher on Soto's return tosses -- and he drew the same conclusion (although he calls the yips ""The Thing"").""   It still bothers the shit out of me and I wish he'd stop doing, but at least there might (maybe?) be a point to it."
whitesox,36d5rm,speeder1989,1 point,Mon May 18 19:52:14 2015 UTC,I was listening to the A's broadcast when they talked about that and found it fascinating. It also helped hear them acknowledge it

whitesox,36dn6h,WhiteSoxWarrior,5,Mon May 18 15:38:48 2015 UTC,Yea screw those rankings. Sox could win 15 straight all on the road and maybe crack the top 10
whitesox,36dn6h,callmeroo,4,Mon May 18 15:58:33 2015 UTC,"15 on the road against detroit, kc, and the cardinals would help us crack the Top 15"
whitesox,36dn6h,AnDEErew,2,Mon May 18 16:17:45 2015 UTC,"I guess they think it's all a fluke. We're the 14th best team in baseball by record. That's obviously not the only criteria but 23 seems really damn low. Oh well, ESPN will just say whatever makes the most people happy anyway."
whitesox,36dn6h,arsesox,3,Mon May 18 17:49:44 2015 UTC,"No they say whatever will get the most people talking, and this has us talking so mission accomplished"

whitesox,36b6tq,joey_slugs,11,Sun May 17 23:21:41 2015 UTC,4/5 of the AL Central teams are at .500 or higher... bizarre.
whitesox,36b6tq,bababooey55,3,Mon May 18 01:40:47 2015 UTC,I'm not confident the twins will sustain > .500 baseball the entire season.
whitesox,36b6tq,frisbee_hero,3,Mon May 18 12:08:12 2015 UTC,"I mean, it's still only mid-May so very early in the year, but if you were to objectively look at the ALC standings and pick 1 team that might be a bit lucky to be at .500, it's probably us, with out -29 run differential, which is the 2nd worst in the American League."
whitesox,36b6tq,mattfromchicago,2,Mon May 18 12:45:36 2015 UTC,"Having five blowout losses this early will do that to you, especially when there's really only been one blowout victory."
whitesox,36b6tq,SlagginOff,2,Mon May 18 13:47:36 2015 UTC,"That's true, but good teams don't usually get blown out 5 times for every 1 time they blow someone out."
whitesox,36b6tq,mattfromchicago,1 point,Mon May 18 18:35:20 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. It's nice to see them putting something together. Hopefully they can continue to play well enough to be considered a good team, despite the rough start."
whitesox,36b6tq,SlagginOff,1 point,Mon May 18 19:18:11 2015 UTC,How many of those games had Noesi starting too?
whitesox,36b6tq,pmmoritz,1 point,Mon May 18 19:48:34 2015 UTC,"B-R calls any game of 5+ runs in differential a blow out; the Sox have played in 10, lost 7.  Noesi has started 2, but the 2nd one was the game he was hit in the doubleheader against Cincinnati.  He had given up 0 runs when he was forced out of the game in the 2nd inning, the Red didn't actually score a run until the 6th and didn't blow the game out until they put up 7 in the 9th so putting that at Hector's feet seems a bit unfair.  But for accuracy's sake, the list is:   Samardzija - 2 (4/6, 4/29) Noesi - 2 (4/10, 5/9 Game 1) Quintana - 1 (4/19) Sale - 1 (4/30) Danks - 1 (5/3)"
whitesox,36b6tq,mattfromchicago,2,Mon May 18 19:58:11 2015 UTC,Maybe the division is actually good this year?

whitesox,36b6tq,buckets41,5,Mon May 18 00:08:31 2015 UTC,"I am rooting for Cleveland. I was in Cleveland last summer for the Sox/Indians game on the day that they announced LeBron's return. I could see the excitement in everybody. Honking horns. Chugged beers.   They've gone a long time without a championship (1964 NFL and 1948 MLB [my mom was at that final game in Boston])  It's hardly the most exciting place to live, so I'll be cool with them getting a little joy."

They might take them off day of game, though, because the team still does that dynamic pricing bullshit.  My advice is to either splurge a little bit and get more centrally located Upper Deck tickets or do the Lower Bowl corners.  A little extra cash, but a much, much better experience."

whitesox,36ady8,socklessmoejohnson,4,Sun May 17 20:20:30 2015 UTC,Because our other catcher is Tyler Flowers
whitesox,36ady8,ricker182,1 point,Sun May 17 21:03:17 2015 UTC,TFlowers is actually pretty damn good at framing pitches.
whitesox,36ady8,crak6389,1 point,Sun May 17 21:11:00 2015 UTC,And he has a knack of being able to throw back to the pitcher without falling down.
whitesox,36ady8,ricker182,5,Sun May 17 21:42:45 2015 UTC,I assume he always plays with Jeff because they used to play together on the Cubs?

whitesox,36ady8,ricker182,2,Sun May 17 22:28:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he was very stiff, was way too serious, didn't always finish his thoughts or sentences. But, he's definitely funny, and once he gets comfortable talking as much as an announcer needs to, I think he has a future in baseball broadcasting if he wants it."
whitesox,36ady8,khirn,1 point,Sun May 17 22:29:32 2015 UTC,I was really surprised after the first game because I've heard him speak a few times and he was well spoken. Told great stories too.

whitesox,368gux,bababooey55,3,Sun May 17 05:58:59 2015 UTC,"timely hitting with runners on base, good defense, dependable pitching and relief = wins...... somehow, the Sox are finding this combination at this moment...lets hope it last"
whitesox,368gux,decaturbob,2,Sun May 17 12:22:55 2015 UTC,"C'MON BOYS, ALMOST TO .500!"

whitesox,3683v8,SultanofStella,9,Sun May 17 02:12:09 2015 UTC,"As a die-hard fan I love hearing him, but he's still going to be kind of boring to the more casual fan. That said, he's loosening up a bit and I like that. Definitely not a color guy.  I would LOVE to hear him and AJ together in the booth. Both extremely knowledgeable of the game and we have to keep the tradition of having a hated color commentator alive (and AJ is an awesome analyst)."
whitesox,3683v8,bababooey55,4,Sun May 17 03:31:56 2015 UTC,I'd love to hear AJ and Hawk. I bet it'd be ridiculous.
whitesox,3683v8,captain_kindness,12,Sun May 17 04:50:34 2015 UTC,"AJ and Hawk, on their best nights, would be like Doug and OB. On their worst nights, they'd be like my sisters-in-law when the pizza is late."
whitesox,3683v8,HeadBanzMakeHerDance,2,Sun May 17 05:16:01 2015 UTC,I agree that his tone can be bland but significant improvement from game 1 to game 2.
whitesox,3683v8,frisbee_hero,7,Sun May 17 12:26:48 2015 UTC,i loved the ozzie/sunscreen story tonight he mentioned in passing. more little ex-player tidbits like that during the dry moments of the game would make him a great guy to listen to in the booth.
whitesox,3683v8,Benhg,2,Sun May 17 04:18:20 2015 UTC,Yeah that was absolutely hilarious.
whitesox,3683v8,socklessmoejohnson,4,Sun May 17 12:27:16 2015 UTC,I really like him. He is bringing a modern perspective to the booth. Rowand is not far out of the game and has faced many of the pitchers  in the league today.
whitesox,3683v8,Benhg,8,Sun May 17 04:57:10 2015 UTC,He's pretty good. I think he could loosen up a bit and be a little less serious but he's pretty good.
whitesox,3683v8,Vernacularry,3,Sun May 17 02:55:56 2015 UTC,It seems like he's still finding his voice.
whitesox,3683v8,FerociousGooch,2,Sun May 17 03:15:27 2015 UTC,Oh yeah for sure. It takes time to learn any new skill and I was just pointing out something he could improve at.
whitesox,3683v8,polishgenious,5,Sun May 17 03:17:44 2015 UTC,We're undefeated with him there.  Both Hawk and Rowand had an engaging discussion of superstitions.  Leave him there till we lose.
whitesox,3683v8,crustyruffles,3,Sun May 17 04:17:49 2015 UTC,His evaluation of the A's relief pitchers has been really interesting. Shows he has a different perspective than Hawk or Stone.
whitesox,3683v8,polishgenious,0,Sun May 17 03:57:00 2015 UTC,"He's just been reading directly from his cheat sheet, something I sincerely doubt Hawk has done in years."
whitesox,3683v8,BuffyTheUmpireSlayer,3,Sun May 17 16:11:23 2015 UTC,Tonight is definitely better than last night. I wouldn't mind him showing up every now and then. There's definitely a future in it for him if he wants to.
whitesox,3683v8,america_rex,2,Sun May 17 03:20:57 2015 UTC,"The best part last night was when he loudly knocked something over, audibly mumbled ""sorry,"" and the booth went silent for about 75 seconds."
whitesox,3683v8,BuffyTheUmpireSlayer,1 point,Sun May 17 16:13:10 2015 UTC,"I caught some of Rowand while flipping back and forth from the 'Hawks game and he didn't annoy me at all, which is a good first step. He also didn't stumble over Hawk talking or anything; seems like he has some experience or knows what he's doing. I found him likable enough."
whitesox,3683v8,america_rex,-1,Sun May 17 22:35:12 2015 UTC,Put him on the radio. Anything would be better than the dumpster fire on it now
whitesox,3683v8,BuffyTheUmpireSlayer,7,Sun May 17 04:04:04 2015 UTC,I actually don't mind Ed and DJ. I've been forced to listen to them more lately and I found them a lot more informative than I remember them being.
whitesox,3683v8,ChiSoxBoy,-3,Sun May 17 04:10:42 2015 UTC,I just hate farmer. Never lets you know if it's a homerun until it crosses the fence even if it's 20 rows up and clearly gone off the bat
whitesox,3683v8,BuffyTheUmpireSlayer,3,Sun May 17 04:20:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he really isn't a play by play guy. Or shouldn't be. But he actually engages DJ (unlike Hawk, who of course only cares if you agree with him) and they were actually talking baseball the last couple of times I listened. It was refreshing. Little nuances and such."
whitesox,3683v8,bns01,2,Sun May 17 04:28:54 2015 UTC,Rongey has done a great job in the couple of times he's filled in doing play-by-play this season. Wouldn't mind him taking the job in the future. The last nine years of hosting the pre- and post-game shows would make you think he'd be next in line

whitesox,367sr7,thom_weights,6,Sun May 17 02:05:05 2015 UTC,I really think we're about to go on a run here.     16 out of 20 game run.
whitesox,367sr7,ricker182,4,Sun May 17 02:08:51 2015 UTC,"Well, 5 out of 6 is a damn good start"
whitesox,367sr7,TheHoneyBadger23,3,Sun May 17 02:13:03 2015 UTC,4 games against the Indians. Taking all of them would be fucking sweet
whitesox,367sr7,haf12,7,Sun May 17 02:18:20 2015 UTC,Shoutout to Johnny Danks tonight. One little rough spurt and been pitching great since.  If we can just get him to have a mid 4 ERA and be semi-reliable this year that would be great.
whitesox,367sr7,bababooey55,3,Sun May 17 03:19:35 2015 UTC,"I'll be the first to admit, I'm not a Danks fan.  But he's strung together two quality starts and I'm pulling for him.  I just want to deliver exactly as you said...a high 3, mid 4 ERA and 6-7 innings a start."
whitesox,367sr7,TheHoneyBadger23,7,Sun May 17 03:21:36 2015 UTC,Big tip of the cap to Danks tonight. He's looked really good. Now let's just hope his next turn he's not knocked around for 8 in 3 IP again.
whitesox,367sr7,crustyruffles,7,Sun May 17 03:22:21 2015 UTC,Holy fucking shit Sanchez. Like... holy shit.  Yeah he can play D.

whitesox,367sr7,thom_weights,6,Sun May 17 01:58:26 2015 UTC,"Hell of an at bat Avi! Hell yes!   If we didn't score here, I think that would have been the millionth time we've left the bases loaded this year."
whitesox,367sr7,dhcrazy333,5,Sun May 17 02:05:27 2015 UTC,That was riveting
whitesox,367sr7,samlincoln,2,Sun May 17 02:05:27 2015 UTC,Going down 0-2 I thought for sure he'd be a quick out but he battled back.

whitesox,367sr7,socklessmoejohnson,4,Sun May 17 01:50:32 2015 UTC,Lots of Astros fans around here recently
whitesox,367sr7,samlincoln,3,Sun May 17 01:51:31 2015 UTC,Not sure if you're tongue-in-cheeking or not but everyone with custom flair was having the problem.
whitesox,367sr7,TheHoneyBadger23,3,Sun May 17 02:00:33 2015 UTC,"Yea I had ""Hell Yes!"" but apparently that code is now the astros flair"
whitesox,367sr7,haf12,3,Sun May 17 02:09:37 2015 UTC,"Someone must have changed my flair, haha. Very much a Sox fan. Sadly on mobile so it'll have to stay for the rest of the game..."

whitesox,367sr7,crak6389,6,Sun May 17 02:50:00 2015 UTC,What a beautiful bunt by Eaton and using his speed to make them pay for the error. I think he would have been safe either way and great job by the Melkman to bring him home!
whitesox,367sr7,DomCaboose,6,Sun May 17 03:04:57 2015 UTC,Shoutout to /u/NineduceXII - Nailed it!

whitesox,367sr7,socklessmoejohnson,6,Sun May 17 03:23:23 2015 UTC,Been extremely high on him since I saw him in a Tigers uniform when he was like 20. Was telling all my Tigers friends that they had something special so I was ecstatic when we got him.  Not like the Tigers lost out either as they got Jose Iglesias who is incredible.
whitesox,367sr7,bababooey55,5,Sun May 17 03:26:01 2015 UTC,"Rowand has been great today. Not quite as good as Avi at the plate, but pretty good."

whitesox,367sr7,haf12,3,Sun May 17 02:12:17 2015 UTC,Does anyone know the significance or story behind the elephant standing on the baseball on the A's jerseys?
whitesox,367sr7,TheHoneyBadger23,3,Sun May 17 02:18:59 2015 UTC,"The ""Athletics"" name originates from the late 19th century ""athletic clubs"", specifically the Philadelphia Athletics baseball club. They are popularly nicknamed ""the A's"", in reference to the Gothic script ""A"", a trademark of the team and the old Athletics of Philadelphia. They are also known as ""the White Elephants"" or simply ""the Elephants"", in reference to then-New York Giants' manager John McGraw's calling the team a ""white elephant"". This was embraced by the team, who then made the team's mascot a white elephant, and often incorporated it into the logo or sleeve patches. During the team's 1970s heyday, management often referred to the team as The Swingin' A's, referencing both their prodigious power and to connect the team with the growing disco culture."

whitesox,367sr7,samlincoln,2,Sun May 17 02:41:03 2015 UTC,Finally separating himself from Dunn.
whitesox,367sr7,bababooey55,4,Sun May 17 02:42:19 2015 UTC,I want to hear some more Ozzie stories from Rowand.
whitesox,367sr7,bababooey55,3,Sun May 17 02:44:18 2015 UTC,I was thinking the same thing.  The things that go through that man's mind.....Wowsers!
whitesox,367sr7,TheHoneyBadger23,4,Sun May 17 02:45:20 2015 UTC,YES JOSE!
whitesox,367sr7,bababooey55,4,Sun May 17 03:06:28 2015 UTC,"His bat and wrist control is simply some of the best I've ever seen.  And no, that's not a euphemism for anything.  His 1st AB when he had to keep his hands in for that liner and then adjusting to his the high fastball in his 3rd AB was just great hitting!"
whitesox,367sr7,TheHoneyBadger23,3,Sun May 17 03:14:57 2015 UTC,"Danks, Duke then hopefully DRob?"
whitesox,367sr7,socklessmoejohnson,3,Sun May 17 03:12:58 2015 UTC,We're giving Oakland the Ds
whitesox,367sr7,CheddarGuevara,5,Sun May 17 03:24:16 2015 UTC,Poor Coco
whitesox,367sr7,samlincoln,4,Sun May 17 03:16:17 2015 UTC,".061/.162/.091 so far this year holy shit, .077 BABIP no less. And I thought that we had it bad with Eaton."
whitesox,367sr7,socklessmoejohnson,2,Sun May 17 03:17:39 2015 UTC,Eaton's turning it around quickly. Past week he's hitting .360.
whitesox,367sr7,reekorse,3,Sun May 17 03:21:20 2015 UTC,"Were they seriously playing that ""In Love With The Coco"" song for him?"
whitesox,367sr7,CheddarGuevara,3,Sun May 17 03:20:32 2015 UTC,"As it's 77 in my house right now, it aggravates me that these guys are in coats and 58 degrees"
whitesox,367sr7,TheHoneyBadger23,3,Sun May 17 03:29:24 2015 UTC,Glad we got that insurance run oh lawd.  Sanchez already paying off.
whitesox,367sr7,socklessmoejohnson,4,Sun May 17 03:39:12 2015 UTC,Oh shit here he comes.
whitesox,367sr7,samlincoln,4,Sun May 17 03:48:18 2015 UTC,Fuck that was tense
whitesox,367sr7,socklessmoejohnson,4,Sun May 17 03:53:56 2015 UTC,Phew.
whitesox,367sr7,crak6389,3,Sun May 17 03:54:08 2015 UTC,Let's hope we can take advantage of a struggling A's team before they start playing any better. They're definitely not as bad as their record might suggest.
whitesox,367sr7,socklessmoejohnson,2,Sun May 17 00:16:50 2015 UTC,Just like the Sox
whitesox,367sr7,ProfSweetness,3,Sun May 17 00:45:35 2015 UTC,"So what's the deal with WGN America this year? No games on at all? I'm in Michigan and I'm used to a Saturday or Sunday game at least being on tv (although I have mlb.tv so no biggie, but it's nice just to watch on regular cable)."
whitesox,367sr7,bababooey55,3,Sun May 17 01:11:07 2015 UTC,Only in WGN in Chicago I believe. Sucks for me in Iowa as well.
whitesox,367sr7,SHINE09,3,Sun May 17 02:22:57 2015 UTC,Ugh. I thought my hatrid for Butler ended when he left Kansas City.
whitesox,367sr7,Come_Sale_Away,3,Sun May 17 01:21:20 2015 UTC,Butler comes back to haunt us  EDIT: And now bad base running comes back to haunt us.
whitesox,367sr7,TheHoneyBadger23,3,Sun May 17 01:21:47 2015 UTC,"Well that would have scored Avi from 3rd, but meh. Good to see some early run support anyway. Let's get another quality start by Danks please.    Edit : I can't read scores."
whitesox,367sr7,dhcrazy333,4,Sun May 17 01:33:35 2015 UTC,But no runs scored?
whitesox,367sr7,socklessmoejohnson,2,Sun May 17 01:37:16 2015 UTC,"Well I'm dumb. I can't read the scoreboard, I thought we were winning."
whitesox,367sr7,dhcrazy333,3,Sun May 17 01:39:28 2015 UTC,I just never assume that the White Sox are winning.
whitesox,367sr7,socklessmoejohnson,3,Sun May 17 01:41:03 2015 UTC,"Hey guys. Im watching this game on MLB Network. Just wondering, how do you guys feel about your announcers? At least I think they are the Sox announcers..."
whitesox,367sr7,FlannelBeard,3,Sun May 17 01:39:45 2015 UTC,"That one guy is Aaron Rowand, 2nd game he's announced since substituting for Stone so a little choppy."
whitesox,367sr7,samlincoln,3,Sun May 17 01:41:48 2015 UTC,"Hawk is a very polarizing figure, either hate or love him. I think he's tough to listen to, and makes the game tough to watch because of all his ""homerisms"" . But it can be more fun sometimes"
whitesox,367sr7,Cheeky_buggah,2,Sun May 17 01:54:16 2015 UTC,Hawk Harrelson and Aaron Rowand. I Love em.
whitesox,367sr7,NineduceXII,2,Sun May 17 01:41:03 2015 UTC,"I presume you're talking about Rowand and Hawk? Rowand is replacing Steve Stone and there's a love/hate relationship with Hawk.  Personally, I like the guy but sometimes the chemistry with him and Steve Stone isn't the best and sometimes pedantic."
whitesox,367sr7,TheHoneyBadger23,3,Sun May 17 01:41:32 2015 UTC,Bad pitch count and down 2-0 but still good to pitch over that lead off double.
whitesox,367sr7,samlincoln,3,Sun May 17 01:49:50 2015 UTC,Jose u gotta put the bat on the ball buddy
whitesox,367sr7,Cheeky_buggah,3,Sun May 17 01:58:38 2015 UTC,"Come on Avi, cash one in right here."
whitesox,367sr7,socklessmoejohnson,3,Sun May 17 02:01:27 2015 UTC,I miss the option for custom flair. That's how I recognized everyone.
whitesox,367sr7,NineduceXII,3,Sun May 17 02:03:44 2015 UTC,Chavez already at 64 pitches
whitesox,367sr7,Cheeky_buggah,3,Sun May 17 02:05:46 2015 UTC,Avi's making up for his bad baserunning
whitesox,367sr7,TheHoneyBadger23,3,Sun May 17 02:11:37 2015 UTC,"I hope we can take advantage of Danks in cruise-mode. It'd be nice to get him the W, last time he pitched great but got a no-decision."
whitesox,367sr7,socklessmoejohnson,3,Sun May 17 02:38:27 2015 UTC,Fucking A's broadcast just showed me three pissed-off looking A's fans instead of the LaRoche hit replay. Thanks.
whitesox,367sr7,socklessmoejohnson,3,Sun May 17 02:40:54 2015 UTC,That was a beautiful swing by LaRoach
whitesox,367sr7,TheHoneyBadger23,3,Sun May 17 02:41:14 2015 UTC,Through 37 Games: Chavez --> 0 Wild Pitches  In Tonight's 6th Inning --> 2
whitesox,367sr7,TheHoneyBadger23,3,Sun May 17 02:47:06 2015 UTC,Wtf Alexei!
whitesox,367sr7,NineduceXII,3,Sun May 17 02:48:31 2015 UTC,WOW! Rowand is 100% right! More credit should be given to Ava-SA-EL's baserunning rather than the catch
whitesox,367sr7,TheHoneyBadger23,3,Sun May 17 02:48:48 2015 UTC,"Bad base running again by Avi, can't be too mad with man with 2rbi"
whitesox,367sr7,Cheeky_buggah,3,Sun May 17 02:48:55 2015 UTC,"A's fan here, is Danks awesome? He is always smiling. It's great."
whitesox,367sr7,solostman,7,Sun May 17 02:53:57 2015 UTC,"Used to be a huge player for us, threw a shutout in game 163, had dominating numbers. Then he got shoulder surgery and lost ~4 mph, struggled and is now in to play out his contract. He has at least 4 QS this year and as a 5th starter I'm always pleased if he keeps us in the game."
whitesox,367sr7,samlincoln,4,Sun May 17 02:59:06 2015 UTC,No. Danks is not awesome.  But welcome!
whitesox,367sr7,TheHoneyBadger23,2,Sun May 17 02:54:40 2015 UTC,Haha aw man that's too bad. Thanks!
whitesox,367sr7,solostman,2,Sun May 17 02:55:59 2015 UTC,"I'm sure some of the more die hards here could probably give you a better narrative as to why but he was looked at as having a TON of potential but just hasn't ever quite lived up to it.  Oh yeah, and we're paying him $12+ million $15.75 million this year.......Sorry, I'm bitter"
whitesox,367sr7,TheHoneyBadger23,2,Sun May 17 02:58:43 2015 UTC,"Danks got a pretty brutal shoulder injury shortly after signing a monster contract and his velocity/control hasn't been the same since. As we can't afford to not play him he's tried to reinvent himself as a finesse pitcher, to mixed results. I can't find the stats but as far as I remember he's lost about 5-6 mph on his fastball."
whitesox,367sr7,socklessmoejohnson,2,Sun May 17 03:03:21 2015 UTC,He usually seems super-dour in postgame interviews so honestly I have no idea.
whitesox,367sr7,socklessmoejohnson,2,Sun May 17 02:54:40 2015 UTC,Danks is the opposite of awesome.
whitesox,367sr7,bababooey55,3,Sun May 17 02:59:54 2015 UTC,Crede used to make some plays at the Co
whitesox,367sr7,samlincoln,2,Sun May 17 02:55:08 2015 UTC,I wish we had a Ventura or a Crede at 3rd. I had hopes for Matt Davidson this year after his hot start in Charlotte but it looks like he's struggling again.

whitesox,367sr7,socklessmoejohnson,1 point,Sun May 17 03:06:42 2015 UTC,and it paid dividends. We gave up 1 getting a double play.
whitesox,367sr7,ACSimeon,3,Sun May 17 03:41:34 2015 UTC,Good show Danks. Now don't come back out in the 8th please.
whitesox,367sr7,socklessmoejohnson,2,Sun May 17 03:19:21 2015 UTC,"He had 118 last one, he might."
whitesox,367sr7,samlincoln,3,Sun May 17 03:22:56 2015 UTC,Canha (A's 1B) has the MOST annoying sideburns I've ever seen. I'm actually offended. Dude looks like he should be bartending at a Boston Pizza.
whitesox,367sr7,socklessmoejohnson,5,Sun May 17 03:25:24 2015 UTC,They remind me of Ricky's from Trailer Park Boys....but just not as good.
whitesox,367sr7,TheHoneyBadger23,3,Sun May 17 03:33:10 2015 UTC,Haha. TPB! I'm wearing a shirt with the green bastard on it right now.
whitesox,367sr7,DomCaboose,2,Sun May 17 03:38:45 2015 UTC,"I just watched the ""I am the Liquor"" episode tonight.  God I miss that show!"

whitesox,367sr7,bababooey55,3,Sun May 17 03:53:28 2015 UTC,David Robertson for All Universe
whitesox,367sr7,thom_weights,3,Sun May 17 03:54:39 2015 UTC,Let's get some more runs.
whitesox,367sr7,samlincoln,3,Sun May 17 03:55:51 2015 UTC,Let's GO DRob!!!
whitesox,367sr7,TheHoneyBadger23,3,Sun May 17 04:03:46 2015 UTC,"I'm impressed by the fans at o.co, I wonder if they'll still be there if the A's end up sucking for an extended period."
whitesox,367sr7,socklessmoejohnson,5,Sun May 17 04:08:43 2015 UTC,We need 1 out.  Just one out.  4 outs.  We need 4 outs.  Robin mismanaging the bullpen again.
whitesox,367sr7,TheHoneyBadger23,6,Sun May 17 03:49:00 2015 UTC,"I disagree, I think the pitching changes have been just fine. Duke, Jennings, and Petricka are our best relievers and we played the matchup game and they just didn't perform so we put in D-Rob. Kind of a hindsight thing."
whitesox,367sr7,bababooey55,1 point,Sun May 17 03:52:12 2015 UTC,I just feel like the bullpen has been putting in some OT since the Milwaukee series
whitesox,367sr7,TheHoneyBadger23,2,Sun May 17 04:00:07 2015 UTC,"You can't even count outs correctly, and you are going to pick Robin apart?!?! ;)"

whitesox,367sr7,ACSimeon,2,Sun May 17 02:12:49 2015 UTC,No bunt?
whitesox,367sr7,Cheeky_buggah,2,Sun May 17 02:44:21 2015 UTC,"Suicide bunt maybe, don't want to drop it right in front of home plate. I can't remember if Gillaspie is any good at bunting."
whitesox,367sr7,socklessmoejohnson,2,Sun May 17 02:48:24 2015 UTC,Well shit
whitesox,367sr7,bababooey55,2,Sun May 17 02:48:17 2015 UTC,Wow got the ground ball.
whitesox,367sr7,samlincoln,2,Sun May 17 03:43:50 2015 UTC,Damn.
whitesox,367sr7,crak6389,2,Sun May 17 03:47:19 2015 UTC,4-out Save
whitesox,367sr7,Vernacularry,3,Sun May 17 03:54:08 2015 UTC,c'mon now
whitesox,367sr7,Vernacularry,2,Sun May 17 03:54:28 2015 UTC,Can't be mad at that one.
whitesox,367sr7,crak6389,2,Sun May 17 03:59:03 2015 UTC,Bottom of their order coming up.
whitesox,367sr7,samlincoln,2,Sun May 17 04:03:01 2015 UTC,"Okay DRob, earn that paycheck."
whitesox,367sr7,socklessmoejohnson,2,Sun May 17 04:03:23 2015 UTC,"All right Robertson, lets put a neat little bow on this win"
whitesox,367sr7,Vernacularry,2,Sun May 17 04:04:50 2015 UTC,Woooo
whitesox,367sr7,thegreystash,4,Sun May 17 04:16:37 2015 UTC,"Once we had that lineout, I knew we wouldn't score. Double play was guaranteed.  Also, can someone explain to me how Avi didn't go to 2nd on that wild pitch?!? That would have prevented the double play."
whitesox,367sr7,dhcrazy333,2,Sun May 17 02:48:53 2015 UTC,I think he was hesitant because he got burned earlier in the game.
whitesox,367sr7,socklessmoejohnson,1 point,Sun May 17 02:49:54 2015 UTC,Bleeeehhhh Duke don't fuck this one we need it.
