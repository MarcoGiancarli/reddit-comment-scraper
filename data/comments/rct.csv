rct,3e393t,navalin,2,Tue Jul 21 19:28:26 2015 UTC,"Using OpenRCT i make the cable lift speed go up to 70kmh, which results in this: http://i.imgur.com/G1TjC6b.gif  So basically everytime they go over a cable lift hill piece they go faster."
rct,3e393t,X7123M3-256,4,Tue Jul 21 19:31:23 2015 UTC,"Those are chain lift pieces, not cable lift. The actual cable lift piece from the menu is the crest of the hill. When placed, the track back to the station becomes cable lift, but only if it's straight, uphill track - otherwise you get an error and can't open the ride. Additionally, the OpenRCT2 unlimited speed cheat doesn't affect cable lift pieces, so you can't use them as a launch."
rct,3e393t,X7123M3-256,2,Tue Jul 21 19:54:33 2015 UTC,"I assure you there IS a chain lift button, right there where it is on every other ride.  Your screenshot shows the actual cable lift piece - now, do you see that piece anywhere in the GIF /u/Snitsie posted? In any case, the increase chain lift speed doesn't affect cable lifts (I tested this), so you can't use cable lifts as launches. The pieces in the OPs ride are chain lifts.  EDIT: you've now posted a picture of the special menu. That's for special pieces, the chain lift doesn't belong there. The only ride that has a chain lift in there is the spiral coaster, and that's because the spiral lift is actually a different track piece and not just a normal spiral with the chain lift flag set. I don't know how you've managed to build anything if you don't know where the chain lift button is - the giga coaster is the only one that provides a cable lift."
rct,3e393t,X7123M3-256,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:48:19 2015 UTC,"That is the piece i'm using in this rollercoaster though. The only difference is that i'm using a flat piece instead of a sloped. I do see where i went wrong though, the cable lift is the steep one."
rct,3e393t,navalin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:53:40 2015 UTC,"The cable lift is what you select from the dropdown. The cable lift piece goes from gentle up to steep down, and AFAIK you can't have a cable lift without that piece.  With a cable lift, there's a catchcar that comes down from the top of the lift, engages the train, and pulls it up the lift. It's faster than a normal chain, but the speed can't be changed, and I don't think OpenRCT2 changes that (unlimited launch/lift speeds doesn't affect a cable lift)  The piece in my picture is a standard chain lift. The now deleted parent comment was claiming the giga coaster doesn't have one.  It would be nice if you could use cable lifts as launches, given that that's how Intamin accelerators actually work, but I don't think you can. If you are actually using a cable lift I'd like to know how you did it."

They're cheap enough that buying both from Steam or GOG isn't unreasonable in the slightest.  Making stuff that looks good isn't technically difficult, but determining what looks good requires a good bit of practice. I'm still not the best at stations and scenery, but if you're trying to get good at coaster design, I suggest trying to duplicate real-life coasters. Once you do this enough, you'll get a feel for how to represent elements within RCT2's constraints, and you'll be able to mix and match these elements in custom creations.  Also, we're all happy to offer constructive criticism. Just stick a screenshot of your work on imgur and post a link.  Happy tycooning!"

rct,3e1dck,David_Mudkips,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:20:16 2015 UTC,"RCT1 or RCT2. Personally I recommend 2. Well, it is same with this game as everything else really in life. Easy to learn basics, hard to master. Completing scenarios isn't that hard(especially the easy ones that come along the game). Making coasters isn't too hard either once you get the grasp of physics. On the other hand making coasters that make other people say or think ""awesome!"", can take quite a while. RCT1/2 are games that are still playable nowadays, despite being over 10 years old. They hold their ground same way as many arcade games still do."
rct,3dzeco,nationalSoup29,3,Mon Jul 20 19:42:35 2015 UTC,"The sharp turns low down... ouch. Widen them up. Also keep in mind that airtime creates the most excitement, turns just make nausea (or intensity if the gs are too high, which small turns would do). The beginning 3 drops are fine, it's everything after that needs to either widen up or be more like the beginning, at least until you burn off some speed."

My specific setup is OpenRCT2 running in a Windows 7 VM on a mac and recording with Screenflow (though, really, even the Quicktime Player screen recording function would have sufficed for this purpose). Export as an Apple Lossless .mov, open up in Photoshop, adjust speed to 200%, export to web as a gif, downscale by 50% for smaller file size (in retrospect I wouldn't have bothered downscaling, I'm just unfamiliar with gfycat upload limits), and publish.

rct,3dmb2u,waspocracy,2,Fri Jul 17 18:32:19 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I'm considering doing a dueling Go Kart track of sorts with a highway sorta vibe. Not sure how it'll pan out, but I'll definitely post it here!  Update: Looks like a dueling design isn't going to work, since I can't get stations to synchronize. I'll keep poking at different designs, though."
rct,3dlf5q,Ghostanus,4,Fri Jul 17 05:37:59 2015 UTC,"Looks nice. I wonder if the twister coaster might be better as a vekoma, it just has that feel with the double corkscrews and stuff. Not to mention a Dollywood-esque park probably can't afford as much B&M as you currently have. There are a few things that I think you could pull out too, mostly the last lap around the station and the helixey thing after the third inversion. Just extra track that I don't think does anything for the layout."
rct,3dlf5q,navalin,3,Fri Jul 17 12:14:08 2015 UTC,"Also, from my knowledge, Dollywood is loaded. Have you seen the DreamMore Resort and the teasers for the supposed launched wooden coaster? Not cheap."
rct,3dlf5q,navalin,2,Fri Jul 17 14:17:41 2015 UTC,"Innovative doesn't necessarily mean expensive. Wild Eagle was a very early wing rider, but is relatively cheap compared to something like gatekeeper. They also aren't building new coasters every other year like other parks. I think they're doing much better than they were (Dolly Parton basically saved the park, to my knowledge because it almost went out), so if they do have money it's relatively new.  Also, even if you aren't going for realism, try swapping the ride with corkscrew track. Might add some nice variety in track styles."

rct,3difow,iTrashy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:22:58 2015 UTC,Why did the coaster crash when the guests entered the cars?
rct,3difow,X7123M3-256,2,Fri Jul 17 09:24:23 2015 UTC,"I think adding guests slightly changes the speed of the ride. Side friction coasters have no upstops, so if you pull negative Gs anywhere, you'll crash.   I assume there was a hill taken somewhere that wasn't taken quite fast enough to crash, and when the guests were added, it was."
rct,3difow,wildgoosespeeder,2,Fri Jul 17 09:53:34 2015 UTC,Exactly that. Guests make the cars heavier and thus go downhill faster.
rct,3difow,spacek_toast,3,Fri Jul 17 11:42:08 2015 UTC,Now there's a coaster type you don't usually associate with dueling coaster designs. Good work.

rct,3clhp1,BCawth06,13,Wed Jul 8 22:29:07 2015 UTC,Think Cities Skylines. It runs the same engine and also has steam workshop support.
rct,3clhp1,shanew21,7,Wed Jul 8 23:22:19 2015 UTC,Cities Skylines also had a dev working on the Mod tools for the entire life of the project. So I wouldn't get my hopes up that RCTW will be as in depth as CS
rct,3clhp1,Shaggyninja,0,Thu Jul 9 05:04:48 2015 UTC,"Even if there was a developer dedicated to only the mod tools, the people who need more figured it out on their own.  Even if there is no incredible toolkit like in C:S. It still runs the same engine and as long as they don't do anything stupid to inhibit the ability to modify the games files or structure, we should be seeing some very cool things come launch.  I know I'll be working on some stuff hopefully."
rct,3clhp1,joebo19x,3,Thu Jul 9 15:27:51 2015 UTC,Unfortunately Unity is very mod-unfriendly out of the box because it combines and compresses all game assets into a couple of proprietary files. It doesn't leave any raw files or structures that could easily be modified at all. Adding any modding capability requires hard work by the developer (or maybe tons of money to purchase a Unity source license so you can change how assets are managed).
rct,3clhp1,Sebioff,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:28:15 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming since they said UGC was originally going to be post-launch, and now it's in at launch, that they've figured it out or added mod tools. They wouldn't be touting it if they hadn't come up with a way."

rct,3clhp1,Aethien,2,Thu Jul 9 07:28:21 2015 UTC,Really the best way to get proper measurements is to wear a Go-Pro on your head and go on every single ride at every park. It's the only way to be sure.
rct,3clhp1,Ihmhi,3,Thu Jul 9 16:02:44 2015 UTC,"I agree, but I realize that I'm a total nerd about this stuff and probably in a small minority of potential customers.  I like this screenshot a lot but being a complete loser the first thing I noticed was that it's supposed to be a B&M hyper coaster but the track spine is round instead of square.  My OCD is kicking in.    Part of what enabled Chris Sawyer to make such an amazing game was that he is a huge coaster fan.  He's up to 646 coasters on Coaster-Count (assuming that's actually him).    I loved the original games because all of the roller coasters were modeled after existing manufacturers' products."
rct,3clhp1,CurbYourNewUrbanism,3,Thu Jul 9 13:46:07 2015 UTC,"Another detail I noticed that's making me unnecessarily angry in that the track at the station is above the platform, not level with it. Peeps better have long legs in this game to be able to make that step up..."

You could get a pseudo-isometric thing going like Starcraft 2 where the default camera is isometric but you can rotate it and move it around. Best of both worlds."

Also, I'd maybe suggest switching sides for the launched coaster's transfer track; it'd improve how close together everything is a little in my opinion.

rct,3cb25e,Snitsie,8,Mon Jul 6 14:49:42 2015 UTC,It's because your layout is not timed properly. Best way to fix this is to make sure the trains pass the blocks before the next ones reach the top of the lift hills. You can do that by changing the minimum wait time to let's say 60 seconds.
rct,3cb25e,MrBrightside711,0,Mon Jul 6 15:35:47 2015 UTC,That doesn't work either. Timing the layout by the milisecond is an unholy task if you don't want to make your two duelling coaster identical to eachother.
rct,3cb25e,MrBrightside711,3,Mon Jul 6 16:03:11 2015 UTC,If 60 doesnt work then make it 90. idk. Increase the minimum time until the trains dont stop at the top of the lift

rct,3cb25e,X7123M3-256,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:29:39 2015 UTC,"Check ""synchronize with adjacent stations"" in the options. Trains will leave the block brake as soon as the following block is clear; since these are two seperate tracks the other train has no bearing on when it leaves the block.  If you have two trains on the same track, it is possible to sychronize them with block brakes - see the prebuilt track ""Great White Wail"" for an example. The technique here is that one train is held in the block system waiting for the preceding train to clear it - when the preceding train clears the block the two trains leave their respective block sections at the same time."

rct,3cb25e,X7123M3-256,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:24:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, i did have both Synchronize with adjacent stations boxes marked. Thing is that the block brakes don't synchronize. The moment a train has cleared a block brake it will trigger the train above the lift hill to move forward, completely ignoring the other track where the train isn't yet triggered by the block brakes being cleared since that track is half a second slower. The only way i can see this working is if both tracks are absolutely identical in length, which is something i don't see quite as necessary for synchronized rollercoaster and don't really want to be forced to make.   The only way i can make this synchronized coaster work is by not using blockbrakes, which is quite sad."
rct,3cb25e,navalin,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:57:33 2015 UTC,"Both trains should depart the station at the same time - if that isn't happening, something is going wrong. If one train arrives at the station before the other, it should wait for the other to arrive."
rct,3cb25e,inthemanual,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:06:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it doesn't. Might be some kind of bug. It does work when i don't use blockbrakes so i'll just skip realism for aesthetics."
rct,3c935a,Ghostanus,3,Mon Jul 6 01:17:15 2015 UTC,"Looks pretty good. The only thing I'd be aware of is that it looks relatively square currently. Try to get some more organic paths, and also sink that pond down a unit."
rct,3c935a,navalin,2,Mon Jul 6 01:33:29 2015 UTC,"http://i.imgur.com/eFP7h1r.png  Paths become more organic as the park opens up. In almost all of my parks, I go with a cone shape park. Easy for me to keep my thoughts together as I build front to back. Paths widen out as I progress, allowing more and more space to build. I hope that makes sense, it's just my favorite way of building."
rct,3c935a,navalin,3,Mon Jul 6 01:47:41 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, yeah that is quite good. I think the pool/pond still looks out of place being so square.

Are you talking about how I just have trees right next to the path? If so, I can see how fading the brush up to the treeline would look better."
rct,3c935a,doherallday,2,Mon Jul 6 01:54:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's all I'm saying. In some cases it works, but IRL when installing a path they'll mess up 5-10 feet beyond it and kill off any bigger trees with the equipment. That and in game it looks cleaner instead of hiding the paths from different angles."

rct,3c757r,Snitsie,6,Sun Jul 5 14:32:19 2015 UTC,You've got three trains in the same block.
rct,3c757r,X7123M3-256,6,Sun Jul 5 14:35:42 2015 UTC,I've never understood this blocked section thingie so i just use continuous circuit lmao.
rct,3c757r,X7123M3-256,12,Sun Jul 5 14:37:13 2015 UTC,"The track is divided into blocks. Only one train is allowed in a block at a time. If there is a train already in a block, the incoming train will be stopped by the block brakes and wait until the block is clear before advancing. Lift hills and stations also count as a block section - any point on the track where a train can be brought to a stop and then go on to complete the rest of the circuit can be used as a block. The maximum number of trains you can run is  one less than the number of blocks - there has to be a clear block somewhere or nothing will move.  Even if you don't care about realism, the block system will prevent your rides from crashing."
rct,3c757r,X7123M3-256,3,Sun Jul 5 14:44:27 2015 UTC,"Ah, i see how it works now. This means 1 train can only ever be riding the track right? That is quite disappointing to be honest. I mean, it makes it completely useless to use 3 trains.  Also aren't regular brakes immune to breakdowns aswell?"
rct,3c757r,JonasBrosSuck,7,Sun Jul 5 14:49:45 2015 UTC,"You can have multiple trains on track, but only ever one in each block. Usually, they'll be three blocks, allowing you to run two trains:   The station The lift hill The rest of the layout   You can also put block brakes in the middle of the layout - these are known as mid-course brake runs. They are commonly seen on very long coasters, and coasters with single car trains. This increases the number of trains you can run further.  Brakes won't break down in RCT2 (at least I've never had that happen), but trains can still collide with each other if you don't run in block section mode."
rct,3c757r,X7123M3-256,3,Sun Jul 5 14:54:11 2015 UTC,I see. I'm not really a fan of the way it looks to be honest. I think i'll just add some brakes to this thing and use it like that.
rct,3c757r,JonasBrosSuck,3,Sun Jul 5 14:57:29 2015 UTC,"for best rollercoaster design, should there only be one lift hill?"
rct,3c757r,X7123M3-256,3,Sun Jul 5 18:56:42 2015 UTC,"Generally. Very few coasters have more than one. For some types of rides it's acceptable to have two, but for a B&M like this it's unheard of. It does depend on whether you're going for a realistic design, or just one that will work well in the game."
rct,3c757r,JonasBrosSuck,2,Sun Jul 5 19:00:05 2015 UTC,what's a b&w?
rct,3c757r,wildgoosespeeder,2,Sun Jul 5 19:19:29 2015 UTC,"B&M is a company that makes rollercoasters. The game uses invented names for the rides, but every ride in the game is modelled after a real ride. The Twister coaster, Hyper-Twister coaster (Wide cars), Stand-Up Twister coaster, Inverted coaster, Flying coaster, and Vertical drop coaster are all B&M rides."

rct,3c757r,wildgoosespeeder,2,Sun Jul 5 22:04:48 2015 UTC,"Images with more than one train in the same block just look wrong to me. Even when stitching together multiple screenshots of a ride, I still make sure there aren't two trains in a block because it just looks awkward otherwise."
rct,3c757r,wildgoosespeeder,3,Sun Jul 5 22:06:47 2015 UTC,This image makes more sense http://www.railway-technical.com/sig101.gif  (The signals act as block breaks in the words of rct) so train 2 can enter midle block but won't be able to enter the right block because train 1 is in that block already.
rct,3c757r,vulcanizr,2,Sun Jul 5 19:11:54 2015 UTC,"In RCT2, watch the tutorial how to build a roller coaster. Can't do it in OpenRCT2 because presumed brokenness because code was modified and could break the game."
rct,3c757r,Austinperroux,2,Sun Jul 5 22:00:55 2015 UTC,IKR. My more advanced knowledge how roller coasters work and can be built in RCT2 is screaming at me to give the coaster some block brakes.

Get rid of those walls surrounding the ride and get some paths and rides nestled in there instead, maybe even throw some foliage in. The station building can also be a lot smaller. Like only over the station and a max of 5 tiles wide for the entrance, maybe up to 3 on the exit.   Also, if you are going for an actual Gatekeeper type coaster, you can download custom wingrider trains."

rct,3c95ac,F1REspace,4,Mon Jul 6 01:37:15 2015 UTC,"Looks awesome. The ornamental trees are the only weird thing. Otherwise, I know you're going for small, but the layout should be like 2-3 times as long in my opinion."
rct,3c95ac,navalin,2,Mon Jul 6 02:02:28 2015 UTC,"I agree on the layout. If you really want to keep it short, I think you should have a smaller first drop, since at this point there must be a ton of speed left to burn after that brake run. Drop it down so that it hits a top speed of no more than 39-40 mph as it gets through the first loop, and maybe use a diving first drop instead of a straight one.   Also, I think what's missing is the surrounding context, in a real park. So get building!"
rct,3c95ac,6ca,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:12:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the suggestions! The speed is slightly above at 42 mph out of the loop right now. But I'll see what I can do about the layout, I agree it is a bit short."

rct,3by846,X7123M3-256,3,Fri Jul 3 13:48:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but this post makes me think: nobody would try to open up an amusement park with just $10,000 in capital.   At least that's how I justify using trainers to give me more money in sandbox."
rct,3by846,lucke0204,8,Fri Jul 3 16:48:04 2015 UTC,"Yes, but rides in RCT are ridiculously underpriced. A real rollercoaster costs tens of millions of dollars. So you have to multiply that $10000 by about 1000 to get a better idea of what it would be worth IRL."

rct,3by846,X7123M3-256,3,Sat Jul 4 00:28:25 2015 UTC,"Well, you have to consider how much ""realism"" is actually fun... Like having a day/night cycle where guests come and go. Each day would have to be at least a few minutes long and you wouldn't have nearly the income of a real amusement park. Constructing anything would take months in-game time which means hours. One thing that pisses me off is that guests arrive at an amusement park and are happy to pay a $50 entrance fee (when it should be 60~70) yet only brought $45 in cash. Like wtf."
rct,3by846,Cyberworm360,2,Fri Jul 3 17:14:12 2015 UTC,"What I do is design my rides in a ""sandbox"" type park, and then save them as a track design with all scenery included. Then I can build them in the actual park without wasting money. I don't usually bother with things like flowers and fencing until the park is already profitable; that flat ride is going to take a long time to cover the cost of all that scenery."

For anyone who isn't familiar with this, some scenery (for example the basic square-roof tiles)gives more money than it takes, if you pile alot(or not alot, but more gives more) of it on area, then build small flat-ride on top of it(spiral slide for example), and then demolish the ride. Altough I do consider it cheating."
rct,3by846,wildgoosespeeder,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:30:12 2015 UTC,"I consider it cheating also, but using the cheat window is definitely cheating. To be honest, there's quite a few methods of making money that exploit the game AI but aren't obvious cheats - for example, abusing no-entry signs to get huge numbers of guests on your rides, or closing/reopening the park repeatedly in a pay per entry scenario. I'm not sure if these would be considered cheating, but I try to avoid them nonetheless."

rct,3c02qn,Snitsie,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:33:17 2015 UTC,I think they were for the first 30 seconds on the ride. After they get off I believe the only thing they could think of was how their breakfast was going to taste once it was on the ground XD.
rct,3c02qn,pallosalama,2,Fri Jul 3 17:38:54 2015 UTC,"To add onto this, I'll give a list of reasons why this is by far the worst and most disastrous park for me to date.   The scenario began to go from having fun to trying to complete the objective as fast as possible. So much time was wasted simply trying to get each roller coaster up to at least an excitement rating of 6.0. One roller coaster in particular, a Stand-Up Steel Roller Coaster no many times I tried in this scenario and out of it, I could not for the life of me get the excitement rating up to 6.0. I eventually caved in and after looking up how to raise the excitement rating through other means, through a bunch of scenery half ass around it and built a few other rides next to it before finally feeling happy and moving on. Crashes. Crashes, crashes, crashes >_>. Both types of my wooden coasters and the Mine Train roller coaster crashed on me. I completely replaced the one wooden type only to make it have one train on it. The other was extended to help slow it down by a bit but I gave up on that. The mine train I moved the entire station up into the hill so when the train came back into station, it was traveling less then 20mph without the aid of breaks. I remember seeing something a while back here about how motion simulators can be used to make large amounts of $$$. Part way into this scenario I am sure I must have made the memory up because it was causing so many problems. While it seemed I was making decent cash, I never really checked the numbers myself to confirm it as I was too preoccupied trying to make this all work. The park layout is garbage. If I had the chance I would have never let my paths branch around like that. Certain areas were just prone to high traffic and having crowding issues hit my park rating hard at a few points. Finally, my abuse of scenery. Scenery IMO is suppose to look good but I ended up throwing it along rides to help push that excitement rating up far enough so I could go on my merry way to the next coaster.   In conclusion, while I may have beaten this park, I am in no way or shape happy with it and at some point in the future may come back and do my best to fix it ^"

rct,3bhumu,ModernShoe,3,Mon Jun 29 20:54:21 2015 UTC,"There are many things that could be causing this. A few quick tips would be 1) Banking turns that the train is going fast on, 2) Making hills/inversions high enough so the train gently traverses the top of them (the train should be going 15-30mph at the top of each hill/inversion to lower vertical G forces)"
rct,3bhumu,ViciousKnids,4,Mon Jun 29 21:42:29 2015 UTC,Hard to tell without pictures.  But general advice would be to bank your turns and avoid making the coaster too tall.

rct,3bhumu,Duncans_pumpkin,2,Tue Jun 30 11:20:36 2015 UTC,"I'm certain someone has made that.  Instead of ""wasting"" scenery piece space though, here's another idea: In OpenRCT2 you can change what land is owned, and what isn't without going into the scenario editor. Doing this would allow you to build your trainyard, and then sell the land again, so that it appears outside the park border.  It's fairly simple, and doesn't require any excess hacking either."

This may have been asked and answered already at some point, but I'm attempting to create an RCT2 scenario with multiple disjoint ""parks"" (all in one map). I can create the 3 park entrances that I need, but not 3 guest generation points from the void (2 max, it seems). If I have one generation point link to 2 entrances with a splitting path, the guests will only choose one of the paths, leaving the other entrance unused.  So is there a way to have 3 equally utilized park entrances in a park? Using GOG version if that helps."
rct,3bhumu,inthemanual,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:14:35 2015 UTC,"How are you splitting the paths? Guests in RCT2 are biased to always walk straight on, so if you want even numbers of peeps taking both junctions, you need to make sure that's not an option."

Invisible entrances near the map edge, own the paths to the parks, and the parks themselves, remove the fences with OpenRCT2 (I think it can do this) or a trainer (I know these can), and build fake entrances/fences around the park. The biggest problem with this might be expansion, because the fences could reappear. If this isn't meant to allow expansion, then this should work reasonably well.  If expansion is intended, then maybe only allow 2 parks at first, and allow the others to open up when you can reasonably expand to them from the other parks."

I'm also not sure why the game is allowing two trains into the station, unless you disabled block section mode?  I'd add a brake run long enough to hold a train behind the station, then close and reopen the ride, and if the problem reoccurs it might be an issue with the cable lift, so you could try replacing it with a normal one.  Also check the options and make sure there's nothing like ""wait for full load"" or ""synchronize with adjacent stations"" that might be causing the train to wait."

Also, killing guests penalizes your park rating but isn't usually reflected in the guests' thoughts, so make sure you haven't accidentally built an exit over water or something.

rct,3bfoh1,Doomed,2,Sun Jun 28 20:46:43 2015 UTC,So it looks like seat rotation was only created to simulate actual seat rotation. Chris probably did this so he didn't have to code the physics for it.
rct,3bfoh1,trigger_death,14,Sun Jun 28 21:49:55 2015 UTC,There aren't 'physics' for it in real life... There's actually a second set of offset rails that move up and down relative to the main rails to move a cam go rotate the seats. So it actually is controlled by the ride design and not physics.
rct,3bfoh1,navalin,2,Mon Jun 29 01:20:28 2015 UTC,"Oh neat, I had no idea."
rct,3bfoh1,trigger_death,2,Mon Jun 29 01:39:04 2015 UTC,So is the spin relative to how the train is resting on the track or is the spin relative to the ground? Like say the track takes a 90-degree dip. Will the spin match this image?
rct,3bfoh1,X7123M3-256,3,Sun Jun 28 21:03:18 2015 UTC,"The spin shown in game is relative to the train, regardless of its orientation. If the trains are inverted, you need to rotate the riders 180 degrees if you want to keep them upright."

rct,3bfoh1,X7123M3-256,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:44:30 2015 UTC,Yes.
rct,3bfoh1,X7123M3-256,4,Mon Jun 29 07:02:29 2015 UTC,"This Dinoconda POV does a good job of showing the seat rotation. The first view is from the rider's perspective - if you find this hard to follow, then skip to 2:40 for a view that doesn't rotate with the seats.  There are two elements specific to the 4D (flying coasters can also do these):  A raven turn is like an immelmann/dive loop, but without the twist. The train can enter the element upright, and exit inverted, or vice versa. In addition, the element can be taken in either direction - either with a half loop up and then a drop back down, or with a climb up and a half loop down. During this maneauver, the trains rotate 180 degrees (or sometimes 540 degrees) so the riders are still upright at the exit of the element. This rotation is usually performed at the top of the maneuver, or during the descent.  A fly-to-lie (or lie to fly) is like a zero-g roll, but with only a half twist. The trains rotate 180 degrees during the course of the maneuver to keep the passengers upright.  A full-full is almost exactly like a zero-g roll, but the trains also make a full rotation during the maneuver, i.e. the riders are never actually upside down.  All the current 4D coasters begin the ride with a vertical drop, during which riders are first rotated to face the ground, and then flipped round onto their backs at the bottom. One of Arrow's concept designs begins the ride with a raven turn - this is a nice idea if you want something different.  Another element seen only on X is a camelback hill during which the trains perform a full rotation.  I like designing 4D coasters because you have a lot of flexibility - you can rotate the trains to act as a flying coaster, you can perform inversions without inverting the track, and you can execute maneuvers that a normal coaster couldn't execute safely. However, the existing 4Ds seem to be limited to the elements described above - so it depends whether you want to copy the style of the real rides or just design something that could exist. I find it hard to do a realistic 4D in RCT2 because the track is missing the large half loops, which makes raven turns hard to do well, and with large 4D coasters it's hard to keep the intensity down.  Also remember that RCT2 does not take seat rotation into account when calculating G forces - so it's up to you to remember that positive Gs become negative if passengers have been flipped upside down. A good rule is to never have the riders upside down at the bottom of a drop - most of the time this would result in excessive negative Gs, but the game won't take that into account.   And finally, here are Arrow's original concept layouts for the 4th dimension. These were shown on their website before X was built. Seat rotation isn't included but it can be inferred because they consist of the same elements found on 4D coasters today. These may help you get a better idea of what smaller 4th dimension layouts can look like - the three currently existing are all near-clones of each other so there's not much variety."
rct,3bfoh1,X7123M3-256,0,Sun Jun 28 21:44:32 2015 UTC,"Seems like Theme Park Review demonstration of a Multi-Dimensional Roller Coaster, the seats on the train are in free rotation. Why RCT2 couldn't do this but can do Spinning Wild Mouse and Virginia Reel just fine is beyond me. I still find it hard to judge."
rct,3bfoh1,X7123M3-256,2,Sun Jun 28 22:51:11 2015 UTC,"Which TPR video are you looking at? In the one I linked, the seat rotation is controlled by means of an additional rail on the side of the track. Here's Arrow's patent for the concept. It contains detailed schematics of the trains and the rack and pinion mechanism that drives the spinnning. It also contains another concept layout, if you need more ideas.  You have to remember that RCT2 was released in 2002, and the first Intamin ZacSpin didn't open until 2007. The first S&S Free Spin opened this year. It would be unrealistic to expect RCT2 to feature a ride that didn't actually exist at the time. In fact, RCT3 does feature a ZacSpin, despite being released in 2004; many of the rides in RCT2 and especially RCT3 only existed as concepts or prototypes at the time - some of which never made it to production, such as the Inverted Hairpin Coaster, which was based on this. However RCT2, released only 1 year after X opened, was too early for Sawyer to have had any idea that free-spinning 4D coasters would exist, so that's why they aren't included. They could have been, but with the way the game's designed it's very hard to add them after the fact. Maybe OpenRCT2 will be able too. You have a lot less flexibility with the free-spinning designs - they tend to be built all in one plane, without any turns or twists."
rct,3bfoh1,X7123M3-256,3,Mon Jun 29 06:52:21 2015 UTC,"You know what? I didn't see that rod moving up and down at first. I guess the rotation works like this overly simplified mechanical motion and that why two additional rails have been added to the track.  As for the free rotation version, I admire Chris's dedication trying to match his game version of theme park management to real life concepts at the time. There comes a point where something ceases to be fun where too much attention to detail is applied. I'm shocked that something easier for the player to mess around with (like a new track operation mode) wasn't implemented for the 4th dimension roller coaster type to increase the fun factor or to make something seem less intimidating. It also doesn't help that X is the only premade track design of that type that can't be modified. This is probably why I don't see many people attempting to make 4th dimension roller coasters in RCT2 or RCT3.  Let's face it. Not everything is accurate in RCT1 or RCT2 as to not affect it's fun factor negatively if it were to go too far but most details are correct. For example, powered launch mode needs more track than just the station to reach incredible high speeds. Reverse incline shuttle mode in real life needs another chain lift hill to ensure the train can make it back to the station. The roller coasters in real life don't cost thousands of dollars like they do in the game. Try millions."
rct,3bfoh1,inthemanual,1 point,Mon Jun 29 08:24:19 2015 UTC,"I think the game would be less fun without the controlled rotation - 4D coasters are one of my favourites to build because you have an extra degree of freedom to play with. Many of my designs feature much more rotation than the real coasters because of it.   The game does not take rotation into account at all - it's purely aesthetic, so if you don't care about realism you're safe to just ignore it, or just rotate the trains 180 degrees when on inverted track so you have a ride that doesn't look ridiculous. Usually, I build the complete layout and work out the spinning afterwards.  It would be possible to make a 4D with the rotation calculated automatically, but to do a true free-spinning 4D would require additional physics to be added to the game.  If you want more examples of tracks I could send you my designs - though they're not that realistic because they're designed for scenario play.  It's true the powered launch mode really sucks; I prefer the hacked chain lift launches. I really think the game could do with a dedicated launch piece like the reverse freefall coaster has."
rct,3bfoh1,X7123M3-256,1 point,Mon Jun 29 10:45:29 2015 UTC,"My suggestion doesn't exclude the original mode from existing. Maybe I wasn't clear enough with what I have said. My suggestion would preserve everything that you could originally do with that track type but the additional mode would allow for people to more easily dive into that roller coaster type, which could have been largely underexplored throughout RCT2's existence because the current implementation was just too much to process at once. Sure, additional physics need to be programmed for auto rotation to happen but it is doable seeing how Virginia Reels and Spinning Wild Mouse roller coasters exist in the game, even if it is rudimentary. I'll let the folks that are in charge of OpenRCT2 figure out that one if they feel the need to.  I would love to see your Multi-Dimentional Roller Coaster designs for RCT2! That would be really helpful!"
rct,3bfoh1,ModernShoe,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:27:06 2015 UTC,"If you want free spinning, you'll have to hope openrct2 implements support for it. I'd like this too - then we could have a proper ZacSpin in RCT2. For now, it would be possible to make one where the spinning is calculated automatically based on train position, rather than being under control of the user.  However, given that spinning in RCT2 is purely aesthetic, I'm not sure it's worth it - if you can't get the hang of spinning, just ignore it. It will not damage your ratings, and you can always add it later.  I will send you my designs tomorrow, because it's midnight and I'm going to bed. I might tone down the spinning a bit - some of them have so many flips it's hard to follow without pausing the game at every element."

My one criticism would be to shorten the final turnaround that brings it into the station, or cover it better with scenery because it looks a little out of place. Also i think this track design could really benefit if you put the station on some solid land and raised it up off the ground a bit which would allow you to build a nice custom station for the ride.

I think you just need to delete the config file from your windows user account profile.

rct,3bcxnr,Valdair,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:45:56 2015 UTC,"I hadn't really thought through that even though Steam has a separate installation folder for all of its games, it probably uses the same place in the registry.  The only reason I can even think of why that may have happened now is because I have gone through and edited the setup path for RCT to point back at the installation folder after I merged it with the contents of the copy I had. My own homemade NOCD hack if you want to call it that XD"

I'd always used my disk, and had restated many times as my previous computer was as old as the game and crashed many times. I was just about to begin Karts & Coasters when I decided to update my laptop.   Lo and behold, my disc no longer works. I freaked out.   I am sure my neighbours questioned my sanity. I hit my hand into my desk with enough force for it to hurt for a good couple weeks, screamed, kicked and just generally acted in ways that I'm not too proud of.   In my frenzy, I went into this subreddit and an amazing redditor who remains anonymous gave me a steam copy. Sure, I'd lost my data, but that's okay.   Now I save the game right before I beat each scenario and then copy that save state onto a USB stick in case I lose everything again."

Also, the game has a lot of looks from RCT3, just a bit spiced up. We don't expect Atari to make a true successor to the RCT franchise, so the community is not keen on it. Not to mention the developers don't communicate to their fanbase in a real way.  Also, to clarify, RollerCoaster Tycoon World is not a mobile game. This piece of shit is. And yes, it's a piece of shit, especially when you advertise queues as new features in your trailer.  EDIT: Changed the 0:15 link, because it pointed to a 404 page."

rct,3bbqpj,wildgoosespeeder,6,Fri Jul 3 22:51:14 2015 UTC,"In my honest opinion, what made RollerCoaster Tycoon such a hit was its addicting gameplay, intuitive user interface, and seemingly endless creativity. Seeing 1+2, they still hold up pretty well even though the engine that drives both games is 16 years old. I am not counting Transport Tycoon because that game feels very different even though the graphics are still being rendered in isometric 3D, although the engine that drives that game is a precursor to what would be RollerCoaster Tycoon, all lead and programmed by Chris Sawyer and his team of a few. The credits seem to indicate that this is the granddaddy of indie games before that style of game development became popular.  When I played RCT3 for the first time, it didn't have the same charm as the previous two entries in the series. Also the graphics haven't aged well. All I ever wanted to do was ride my creations because managing a park was more convoluted than it needed to be. Everything felt clunky and unappealing. Little did I know at the time there would be something better called NoLimits which you could import designs from RollerCoaster Tycoon. Development didn't have Chris Sawyer as lead developer so no wonder the game didn't have the same charm.  That's where it should have ended. Then there came RollerCoaster Tycoon 4 Mobile and RollerCoaster Tycoon 3D. Talk about adding insult to injury that RCT3 caused (although I haven't tried the 3DS version but I heard bad things about it). At this point they were beating a dead horse. Just give the license back to Chris Sawyer Atari! Don't pull a Konami or Microsoft, Atari!  Passionate developers had to create the IP Yooka-Laylee because Microsoft told Rare to burn Banjo-Kazooie into the ground and used copyright against them. Same goes for Konami burning Castlevania into the ground and resulting in Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night to be the upcoming spiritual successor to the original Castlevania games.  My only guess now is that fans have caught on and don't wanted to be dooped another time by Atari. I think a true return to glory lies in the hands of OpenRCT2 and that is rather sad. I hope Chris Sawyer goes to crowdfunding to get a true spiritual successor for RCT2 because this video."
rct,3bbqpj,FruitTheory98,2,Sat Jun 27 23:34:58 2015 UTC,"The original RCT as well as Transport Tycoon were created out of passion by Chris Sawyer, TT he didn't even expect to have accepted. It truly was an ""indie game"" with Chris doing all the work with only hired help for the graphics and music. A three person crew.   I also believe that game developers should aim to make games that people don't want sequels for, not because they suck but because they don't need one. Did RCT ever need a sequel? In my opinion, no.   I mean, really, what can Atari do? I think Chris Sawyer had realized that there really isn't anything you can do other than new scenarios and maybe an updated ""roster"" of rides, hence why he hasn't worked on any RCT games since 2. And because of that, nothing that Atari makes will please us. It'll either be ""too similar"" or ""too different, this isn't what I grew up playing!"" they can't win."
rct,3bbqpj,wildgoosespeeder,6,Sun Jun 28 08:14:16 2015 UTC,"That's why I felt that RCT2 was just an improvement rather than a sequel. To me, the RCT series is best in isometric 3D. There are just some games that don't transition well to true 3D. Limitations encourage creativity. All I ever see people doing in RCT3 YouTube videos is crashing them into people or other rides. RCT1 and RCT2 YouTube videos I see people getting really creative or showing off their creations.  I found out a long time ago that sprites created for RCT1 used 3D modeling and pre-rendered them to fit the scale of the game, like this. To really modernize RCT, we need higher quality pre-rendered graphics instead of the dated ""bit-crushed"" graphics we see rendering in DirectX 5 RCT1 or RCT2 or whatever and use something better than DirectX 5, what Chris said went into making RCT1. It doesn't need to use a more modern DirectX's full capabilities or use the fanciness it can provide like a lot of games do for PC these days. It just needs to look like a true RCT game with a modernized look and just feels great to play. That will take a lot of tweaking to get right though. It may be required to redesign the engine from the ground up."

The first rct is great, but the second one has WAY more content and a bit more customization. The game does use roller coaster terms, but not as specific as Cobra Rolls and Immelmann.  Instead, a cobra roll would be considered half-loop, half-corkscrew x2, half-loop.  The best way to get comfortable with the game is to get it and just start messing around! Play a couple scenarios to get yourself grounded, then dive into the custom scenarios.  When you've made something cool, post it here! Have fun"

rct,3b9b3h,gtalley10,3,Sat Jun 27 06:08:58 2015 UTC,"It's a bit more ""LEGO"" than that. You piece together elements and inversions, generally when talking about the layouts online you just call it a dive loop, camel back, batwing, Norwegian loop, etc.  If you haven't played any RCT games before, it might be a good idea to start with the tutorials in the first game because they're super simple. Figure out how to make paths, tracked rides, the basics of how the game mechanics work. RCT2 just adds additional scenery and the ability to raise scenery, and a more ""native"" sandbox mode (RCT1 takes some fiddling).  For good examples of how the creative community plays, check out nedesigns.com."
rct,3b9b3h,pallosalama,2,Sat Jun 27 02:39:47 2015 UTC,"Ha! I like Legos!!      That was exactly what I was wondering. If I was better off starting with the tutorials in 1 for that reason...

The game does NOT use the same terms as real world coasters, but most elements can be made although they often don't look perfect. Easiest way to get into the game is probably by downloading a few parks, get a workbench, and just play around for a bit.  Always good to see new people join the RCT community."

It's a bit complicated but I think anyone can grasp the basics after a few hours.  Now with RCT, I advise jumping right into 2 and downloading OpenRCT2. There are also scenario conversions from the RCT1 scenarios which are imported into RCT2 for you to play (when/if you get around to scenario play)."
rct,3b9b3h,Smitty--81--,4,Sat Jun 27 01:51:31 2015 UTC,"NoLimits... I've seen that mentioned a time or two while reading over this sub, but didn't know that it was a more realistic sim. I'll have to check that out also! I'm just dying to learn all I can about coasters and thought RCT would be a fun way to do it. Thanks a lot!!"
rct,3b9b3h,Idocreating,3,Sat Jun 27 01:57:54 2015 UTC,"NoLimits is closer to a rollercoaster AutoCad program with a pretty steep learning curve where you can basically design a rollercoaster from the ground up that could legitimately be built in a real theme park. RCT is a sim game that incorporates design, economics, and running of a full theme park in a fairly easy to use GUI and is just plain fun where you build rides, hire employees, cater to your peeps, set prices to make money, etc. RCT will be more fun as a game, NoLimits is like being a roller coaster design engineer."
rct,3b9b3h,Valdair,2,Sat Jun 27 04:02:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I did some googling after I read the initial suggestion to check it out. It's exactly what I was looking for but a little out of my price range for this weekend. I did pick up the free demo to tool around with though! It sounds like both will be a blast, just for different reasons. I'm so glad I posted here!!"
rct,3b9b3h,Snitsie,3,Sat Jun 27 04:51:29 2015 UTC,"I suggest RCT2 to start with. You are best off starting with the ""Beginner/Intermediate"" scenarios. Toy around a bit, try everything, find what works and what does not. The game itself is pretty simple, in terms that it won't take very long to get the basic grasp of the game, however as with almost everything, it will take long time to master everything. And still the scenarios the game offers are just a tiny bit of what you can complete. There are Time Twister and Wacky Worlds - expansion packs, that add more scenery, scenarios and other stuff. And the biggest resource is community. I never personally bothered with scenarios other people did, but if you want to try them out you can download probably thousands with no effort. Not to mention custom scenery, rides, ride designs, and so on  This is a great site dedicated to RCT2, with deeper information if you are interested(I enjoyed going through the articles written), all of it still relative eventhough the latest update on the site is almost decade old. http://www.rctmart.com/fossil/index.html"

rct,3b9b3h,Valdair,3,Sat Jun 27 02:05:02 2015 UTC,"Rct2 can do everything rct 1 can, except for a few nitpicky specifics, like unlocking scenarios in a specific order, or using specific land or Edging types. . Rct3 is different. It's 3d, which allows a lot of cool new things, but it lost a lot of what made the first two games memorable for everyone.   Ultimately, it's your own call and your own decision, but I'd highly suggest rct2 or 3 as a starting point, especially if you wish to play creatively. I think the charm of rct1 is in nostalgia, so if you didn't start there years ago,if might not seem as impressive.   I'd suggest playing through a few scenarios, to pick up a feel for the game, then jumping in to creative play, recreating your home park or having fun making th e park of your dreams from scratch."
rct,3b9b3h,Valdair,2,Sat Jun 27 03:34:11 2015 UTC,"I've decided to start with Rct2 for sure. I don't want to start with Rct3 and then essentially go backward to 2. I have a feeling once I get my hands on the coaster cam feature, I won't be satisfied building coasters without that option later. I was just having a hard time choosing between 1 and 2 as my jumping off point. Thanks for your input :-)"
rct,3b9b3h,Brokeit,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:05:15 2015 UTC,"Don't think of it as going forwards or backwards, 2 and 3 are completely different games. The coaster cam is pretty nice but other than that I think 2 is superior in every way."
rct,3b9b3h,pyth1100,3,Sun Jun 28 12:12:37 2015 UTC,"I love 3, and have never played the first two.  Out of curiosity why all the hate for 3?  To OP - I'm a noob too, had 3 for a couple weeks now.

rct,3b8l4k,pallosalama,2,Fri Jun 26 23:25:00 2015 UTC,It's looking good so far - I particularly like the central water area with trees all around ... you will probably find that the areas will naturally start to blend when you fill them in with rides and scenery ... you could make the shape of the red-rock area on the right a bit more blended by extending the left side of it into a curve which goes into the gap behind the hut - it's a bit square at the moment while the other areas are nicely curved
rct,3b8l4k,moonflower,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:06:10 2015 UTC,The canyon(?)(red sand) and mountain are the weakest. I think to tie it together you'll want to just make them secondary textures and just have more sand. Think sand surface but exposed clay edges. You could also blend it a bit better by putting some clay in the mine.

rct,3b5tgh,DustyTheLion,3,Fri Jun 26 05:16:04 2015 UTC,Based on the picture it looks like you could do with lesser lift hill and still be fine. Assuming you want to reduce the g-forces and intensity.

You could reduce the initial height of lift hill to 70-80 and that way take alot of unwanted g-forces away. It would still reach the end with reasonable speed."

rct,3b64ll,thyeggman,5,Fri Jun 26 09:50:03 2015 UTC,Word. It is also interesting at least in that he glitched it all the way to the negatives.
rct,3b64ll,X7123M3-256,3,Fri Jun 26 11:40:19 2015 UTC,"Here's the spirit of rule 2:   Rides with outrageous intensity / nausea ratings and nothing else   Rides that meet this rule are essentially interchangeable. You make them by just making a giant ride with lots of sharp turns and steep hills, and a bunch of inversions.  This is a glitch with excitement, puts it outside the realm of rule 2. My guess is that ride is actually very exciting, but it's so exciting that it wrapped around from 255 to -255. Other posts to this subreddit have been done with a high excitement heartline twister."
rct,3b64ll,thyeggman,3,Fri Jun 26 14:33:11 2015 UTC,"from 255 to -255   If it's wrapping at 255, that means it's an unsigned byte so you'd expect it to wrap to 0, not 255. A signed byte would wrap at 127 (to -128) - but the excitement rating can't actually fit in a byte because it has two decimal places of precision. If it were stored in an unsigned byte, the highest representable excitement would be 2.55. It's probably a two byte quantity."
rct,3b64ll,X7123M3-256,2,Fri Jun 26 15:00:17 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, I have duplicated similar situations where the air time is ridiculously high.    I witnessed a glitch where the coaster went through a 1 block long station and registered as having done so, but was not able to slow down to station speed before it left the station again.  It was an air-powered vertical coaster and thus had a lot of vertical track.  Interestingly, physics no longer applied once the ""entered station"" trigger had been activated, and the train went around the entire track again at station speed, continuing to record stats.  It ended up at around 115 seconds of air time with an excitement of 653.      So, much higher excitements are possible.  I would be interested in learning what the loop/max point is."
rct,3b64ll,X7123M3-256,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:54:45 2015 UTC,"I would be interested in learning what the loop/max point is   Thanks to OpenRCT2, we can find out. From rct2.h:  typedef sint16 fixed16_2dp;   From ride.h:  typedef fixed16_2dp ride_rating;   So the excitement rating is a 2 byte signed fixed-point value with 2 decimal places. Therefore, the maximum value is 327.67. I've no idea how you ended up with 653, but I've seen similar ratings posted here before. Maybe the excitement rating was negative, and gets passed to a routine that interpretes it as an unsigned value at some point?"
rct,3b64ll,Niode,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:14:42 2015 UTC,"I have to imagine it's similar to what was seen in /u/patstrickreed's OP; the value was negative and it interpreted in the data differently or read in a different values or text, like the litter."
rct,3b64ll,CloudScratcher,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:36:25 2015 UTC,I think the litter is probably a consequence of the negative value - I'm assuming that the game calculates the string index by adding some fraction of the excitement rating to a base value; having a negative value causes it to read a string from before the rating strings.
rct,3b3pd0,SP3NGUiN,6,Thu Jun 25 18:38:14 2015 UTC,The drop area of the Pirates ride with the B&M turn is well done.   I think the China themed area needs improvement.. Too bulky at the moment. Your archy could use some more detailing.. but everything looks nice. :)

Maybe just spread the buildings out a bit more? I plan to add more themed areas so maybe it will all be like a collage in the end and kind of blend..."
rct,3b3pd0,TeleMA50c,3,Fri Jun 26 02:15:13 2015 UTC,The actual splashdown part of that ride seems awkwardly short.  I know spacing is tight right there but when the rest of the park is looking so damn cool it sticks out a little.

rct,3b51f9,Mystical_17,2,Fri Jun 26 14:53:00 2015 UTC,Now all you need is few thousand guests to fill those paths.
rct,3b51f9,pallosalama,2,Fri Jun 26 16:36:30 2015 UTC,You could play Extreme Heights to 7000+ guests and then create massive path-system all across the map.
rct,3axg0v,TeaSeaLancs,37,Wed Jun 24 07:34:28 2015 UTC,"The exposure of the shot is completely off. Here it is, adjusted"
rct,3axg0v,FlorentG,15,Wed Jun 24 09:33:02 2015 UTC,Holy shit that makes a world of difference. Looking at the one they posted feels like your vision has gone blurry.
rct,3axg0v,Porcupixel,15,Wed Jun 24 09:43:34 2015 UTC,"I think yours is a bit too extreme in the opposite direction. Hopefully they'll do the same thing as Cities: Skylines did, so that we can adjust it ourselves."
rct,3axg0v,Fridom,-1,Thu Jun 25 10:12:19 2015 UTC,"Fuck playing a game that looks like that.  Honestly.  edit: also exposure is =/= saturation etc, you're also loosing a lot of details in the darks and none in the highs - long story short is you would want to kill someone if you played a game that looked like this."
rct,3axg0v,pvtfish,17,Wed Jun 24 16:26:20 2015 UTC,"Well I guess it's a matter of taste. For a game like RCT, I don't mind a colorful look.  Actually the high saturation comes from the curve adjustment. Granted I could have lowered the saturation down a little bit, it was just a quick edit."
rct,3axg0v,FlorentG,3,Wed Jun 24 18:06:24 2015 UTC,You must not find many games you like then..
rct,3axg0v,llamafarmer42,31,Fri Jun 26 15:24:02 2015 UTC,Holy fuck their PR department is weird. At least this looks more promising than blog posts.
rct,3axg0v,Basssiiie,20,Wed Jun 24 09:06:28 2015 UTC,"I would like to see how the peeps look in this game because that affects large part of how the game feels to me.  From looking at the screen shot it seems like they are going with the realistic theme this time.   Hopefully, they also got away from unrealistic coaster design to more realistic one.  Overall I think this is a step in the right direction."
rct,3axg0v,rse1993,8,Wed Jun 24 08:52:23 2015 UTC,"Couldn't peeps not die in RCT 3? That thing alone makes me disinterested in the third game. I'd be a bit upset if this game didn't have the classic ""29 guests have died in an accident etc."" events."
rct,3axg0v,Ihmhi,9,Wed Jun 24 14:05:20 2015 UTC,"My view on that is that it's a bit morbid for a fun and reasonably realistic game like RCT3 or RCTW to let people die. They handled it really chidishly in RCT3, by letting people fly all over the place, but it shouldn't be compared to RCT1 or 2 because those didn't even have ""real"" guests with personalities or any discernable human features."
rct,3axg0v,scottg96,5,Wed Jun 24 16:22:35 2015 UTC,I personally think it would make you less likely to build unsafe rides. If you feel bad about people dying you'd be more careful about your construction.
rct,3axg0v,Ihmhi,2,Wed Jun 24 16:47:13 2015 UTC,Well judging by the rollercoaster design: http://www.rollercoastertycoon.com/rollercoaster-tycoon-world-production-blog-9/  Good hopes.
rct,3axg0v,llamafarmer42,29,Fri Jun 26 15:25:42 2015 UTC,"Hmm.  On the upside it's an actual screenshot for once. And I know it's just meant to show off assets, but it's just so devoid of life.  I was smiling like a little kid when watching the Planet Coaster trailer, and I'm just not feeling anything from this.  Hopefully the rides and peeps can pull it together, cause this might as well be a screenshot from Theme Park Studio."
rct,3axg0v,Porcupixel,10,Wed Jun 24 07:58:43 2015 UTC,Yeah... It kinda gives me zoo tycoon 1 vibes. Which I thought totally lacked life like you said and was just generally clean but way too sterile.
rct,3axg0v,navalin,16,Wed Jun 24 11:13:00 2015 UTC,"To be honest, that trailer of Planet Coaster (while it might use ingame props or is completely ingame at points) is most likely scripted. While it definitely feels more alive, it probably does not represent the game accurately. I'm glad there is competition, but a fancy trailer wont convince me they are going to be better.  On the other hand, this is just a ingame static screenshot with nothing happening. While I agree it feels devoid of life, it also is a poor representation of the game because we'll most likely be playing from a top-down perspective with actually simulated AI walking though the park.  In the end I'm more interested in the actual gameplay and the ui, which neither of them showed yet. I hope we'll get to see some of that stuff soon.   (I'm also worried that RCTW will flop because the suits might feel pressured due to PC and as a reaction might push deadlines back so they can release the game before PC does.)"
rct,3axg0v,Raymuuze,9,Wed Jun 24 12:37:07 2015 UTC,"It was clearly machinima at best, or fully pre-rendered ""at worst"" but they've also released model previews that match the style and quality of what was shown in the trailer."
rct,3axg0v,FinalMantasyX,9,Wed Jun 24 17:10:57 2015 UTC,I was smiling like a little kid when watching the Planet Coaster trailer   I shed a tear of joy when the employee in the dinosaur suit helps him back up :’)  That was honestly the cutest trailer.
rct,3axg0v,marsallro399,3,Wed Jun 24 13:23:56 2015 UTC,"That's what I was thinking, and I always find it hard to explain. It needs to have good graphics, but good graphics doesn't mean it needs to look realistic. It'd be better if it was a little more stylised in some way that made it have a fun and inviting atmosphere but whilst keeping the rollercoaster models realistic."
rct,3axg0v,Artificial100,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:15:10 2015 UTC,Probably just needs peeps and their throwing up AI to fix that.
rct,3axg0v,llamafarmer42,14,Fri Jun 26 15:26:14 2015 UTC,"Im liking this shot because it shows some of the actual scenery, and it feels like a throwback to 2. At least what is shown looks like it, anyways."
rct,3axg0v,RUDE_LEWD_DEWD,6,Wed Jun 24 10:01:48 2015 UTC,How does it feel like a throw back to 2?
rct,3axg0v,Artificial100,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:11:18 2015 UTC,"More realism, pretty much. Going away from the somewhat cartoony look of rct3."
rct,3axg0v,pmatdacat,11,Thu Jun 25 21:58:03 2015 UTC,"Okay. Okay. I've been openly negative about this game as you can see in my previous posts here. But, I'm moving the lever towards cautiously negative.   I know the top post talks about the exposure of this, but I kind of like the look of a soft for once. Some people prefer a more saturated look. I just hope they allow both sides to be happy."
rct,3axg0v,waspocracy,2,Wed Jun 24 18:39:08 2015 UTC,There'll probably be options to mess around with the graphics a bit.
rct,3axg0v,pmatdacat,11,Thu Jun 25 21:58:42 2015 UTC,Well now I don't know what to believe...
rct,3axg0v,3pmusic,10,Wed Jun 24 07:34:58 2015 UTC,"hmmmmmmmmm.... How does your first official screenshot of Rollercoaster Tycoon not feature a ROLLERCOASTER?!!?!?    But, with this new ""Realism pass"" perhaps there is hope for this after all.  Will wait to see the peeps and the rides before I buy a hype train ticket.  Right now it just looks like Midway Tycoon."

rct,3axg0v,Shaggyninja,11,Wed Jun 24 09:39:35 2015 UTC,"Well, if this game flops we can still hope Planet Coaster turns out amazing.  Hopefully both are great though :)"
rct,3axg0v,tradersam,5,Wed Jun 24 10:10:32 2015 UTC,"They're using unity where it's stupid easy to drop in assets, move them around, turn on some shaders, and grab a screenshot.

rct,3axg0v,Ihmhi,5,Mon Jun 29 03:21:28 2015 UTC,I don't think this is the kind of game they can put on consoles so there's no reason for it to be hamstrung arbitrarily. Then again they could always screw up optimization or something.
rct,3axg0v,xBadger,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:06:32 2015 UTC,"Not to say the final game may still look crummy, but they have released some assets such as a coaster train, coaster control box, etc. and they all look tons better than that originally released trailer.  I'm holding all reservations until we get a new trailer, but it does seem like they've been working to upgrade the quality of the game to a good level, which I can respect."
rct,3axg0v,danmalo82,8,Thu Jun 25 03:07:46 2015 UTC,"""we have an incredible (and large) team working on it""  Sounds like more damage control, due to it seeming like a team of only 2 people have been working on RCTW Redux.  ""Until then, we will be a little quieter on the forums and social media as we focus on our upcoming big reveal.""  Ah, back to having a non-existant presence until they can start working on modeling the rides and coding the game all over again. I don't know why they just don't admit they scrapped everything and started all over again after the RCTW trailer debacle.  Whatever. I don't want to speculate anymore. Back to RCT2/3 for me."
rct,3axg0v,Asehujiko,5,Wed Jun 24 15:35:02 2015 UTC,"I agree. Known teams work on unannounced projects. Currently marketing projects don't have a secret team.  ""if we tell you who it is they'll be distracted by the fanmail""  BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUULLSHIT. Every other gaming company in the world puts out games without getting bogged down by fan/hatemail, from the 1-man indies to the 1000 dev+ teams at Blizzard and Ubisoft  ""Until then, we will be a little quieter on the forums and social media as we focus on our upcoming big reveal."" What kind of ""focus"" by the actual development team could take so much time away from the COMMUNITY MANAGER that he can't MANAGE THE COMMUNITY? Answer: he is the development team."
rct,3axg0v,tabakers5,4,Wed Jun 24 23:10:49 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why everyone is so worked up over a game that we've seen so little of. Almost everyone is being super pessimistic about it and not giving it a chance. I for one am excited to see what the finished product will be, and if it sucks it sucks, but we won't know that without playing it."
rct,3axg0v,BoringCode,5,Wed Jun 24 17:12:00 2015 UTC,"We are pessimistic because the game has now gone through two development studios and is currently on its third. It might as well be dead in the water, but Atari won't admit that (or even acknowledge who the third development studio is)."
rct,3axg0v,tabakers5,4,Wed Jun 24 17:54:13 2015 UTC,But no one has even played it before. How can you be sure it will be bad?
rct,3axg0v,dance1211,3,Wed Jun 24 17:57:35 2015 UTC,I wonder how much of that scenery is placeable. I that image something someone made by putting in benches then bins then trees etc or is it some path type that you have no control over.
rct,3axg0v,pmatdacat,0,Wed Jun 24 10:32:43 2015 UTC,Probably all placeable. This is rct we're talking about.
rct,3azxug,Snitsie,6,Wed Jun 24 21:19:38 2015 UTC,Landspike. Use 8 cars to cap land at max height under landscape and then lower it manually. You will get these occasionally with zero clearances.
rct,3azxug,navalin,2,Wed Jun 24 21:45:52 2015 UTC,"That was a surprisingly easy fix, thanks. As you can see i also managed to get my quad coaster lower and i can tell you it was absolutely horrible. But worth it, in the end."
rct,3azxug,navalin,2,Wed Jun 24 21:49:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah looks much better. I think some of the sand can still come down a bit more but it's decent currently. Also on the ride layout, could you make it more asymmetrical so that the two sides aren't just mirrored? I'm really liking the L shape around the oasis."
rct,3azxug,navalin,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:04:07 2015 UTC,"I think i'm going to slowly chip away at the sand untill i get to the point where i really feel like it's enough.  Als what do you mean with symmetrical rides? The 4 rollercoasters are only symmetrical in the very beginning of the ride, the rest is an arbitrary mess that gave me a lot of headaches."
rct,3azxug,navalin,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:12:28 2015 UTC,Oh is it really? I assumed the left two and right two were just mirrored. I was thinking it'd be cool if they didn't go so far out j to the furthest map corner and instead made more of a giant L around the oasis.
rct,3azxug,oli414,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:14:31 2015 UTC,"I really like the L idea. I might be able to move the oasis up a little bit and chip away some more at the land above the oasis to make the L more pronounced. But yeah, all 4 coasters are completely different. Which is also why it would be an enormous task to change them up again. Here's a video of it so you can see how different they are: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t89_PdG_pEY  I don't think i'm ever change the coasters again. It's been about 4 years since i built them and i have no idea about the nuances of the seperate tracks, what causes intensity/nausea/excitement etc. But yeah, i'm really digging the L idea. Absolutely going to abuse it."

What you want to do is open the cheats menu and select the Zero Clearance tool. This applies the effect to whatever square you have selected. With the tool selected, click on every square that your river rapids is also on. After doing this for the entire ride where the ride is in water, raise the water level (where the ride is in water obviously) until it's level with your ride. Save the game, and reload it. Done!"

rct,3au2qs,iamheadhancho,3,Tue Jun 23 16:45:49 2015 UTC,"In my opinion it is, it's even better if you'd ask me. The only downside  for me is that it can be a bit laggy to move around in full-HD. Besides that it's RCT2 but better, selection areas can be way bigger (up to 32x32), the mountain tool is always available, scenery/ride selection with filters and search bar, scenery/ride selection available using a cheat on the fly, heck amount of built-in trainer hacks/cheats, customizable GUI colors, bulldozer filter (you can delete paths too!), and a lot more and the amount of features is only getting bigger. So my answer to your question is yes ^"

rct,3at8q3,thachicoo,2,Tue Jun 23 09:21:33 2015 UTC,"The reason why your G-forces are excessive is because you used the steep-to-flat piece at the bottom of the first airtime hill.

For me it looks like your screen is 1366x768 and your RCT2 is set to 1024x768 because it doesn't support your screen resolution."
rct,3awb6p,IntelOrca,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:03:48 2015 UTC,I figured at one point that I have been playing it stretched out the whole time. Now you and another have confirmed this. I am going to have to get used to it if I play RCT2. My whole RCT life I feel like has been a huge lie.
rct,3awb6p,demonguard,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:26:55 2015 UTC,This might be related to https://github.com/OpenRCT2/OpenRCT2/issues/1048.  You could try window or fullscreen (desktop) mode or editing documents / OpenRCT2 / config.ini and setting the fullscreen width and fullscreen height manually to see if that helps.
rct,3auka8,Snitsie,5,Tue Jun 23 17:01:27 2015 UTC,"Intensity is way too high -  if any of your stats show in red, it means they're too high. I'm surprised the peeps ride it. The high intensity is caused by your excessive laterals, which is coming from those unbanked curves - generally turns should always be banked unless after a brake run/before a lift hill."
rct,3auka8,X7123M3-256,2,Tue Jun 23 19:07:41 2015 UTC,"Not to mention corkscrews immediately out of the launch, which is set to be fast enough to go through vertical loops later."
rct,3auka8,navalin,3,Tue Jun 23 19:14:05 2015 UTC,I assumed the launch went the other way...
rct,3auka8,X7123M3-256,3,Tue Jun 23 19:33:05 2015 UTC,It can't... Synchronized stations have to have the front of the stations lined up.
rct,3auka8,navalin,2,Tue Jun 23 20:03:02 2015 UTC,"Huh, never knew that."
rct,3auka8,X7123M3-256,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:04:26 2015 UTC,It makes some more interesting combinations possible by alternating station direction. I believe one of the steeplechase quad duelers in corkscrew follies used that.
rct,3auka8,navalin,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:32:41 2015 UTC,I think it might be even less intense if it were going the other direction. It must go through that first half really quickly if there's still enough momentum to get through the loops near the end.
rct,3auka8,zeph_yr,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:49:09 2015 UTC,"Yea, it's the very first part where i'm crossing the lanes that they go too fast in. Was an easy fix in the end since all i had to do was lower the launch speed and get rid of the loops.  Now there's the problem of 2 of my coasters having broken down and my mechanics being unable to repair it for some reason. I guess i'll go reinstall the game."
rct,3auka8,wildgoosespeeder,2,Tue Jun 23 19:59:17 2015 UTC,"""Prehistoric Triple looks too intense for me.""   It's a delicate and tricky process to make the intensity not exceed 10. Just be sure your positive vertical Gs don't exceed 4.5-ish (give or take), negative vertical Gs don't go lower than -2-ish (give or take), and lateral Gs don't exceed 2. Watch the live graphs for where in the track these values break out from these recommended ranges. Too many inversions also drive the intensity rating; around 6-8 is when things get too intense. It also varies by coaster type."
rct,3auka8,wildgoosespeeder,1 point,Wed Jun 24 05:11:45 2015 UTC,All right i gave in and fixed it. I'm still not sure about my attempt at decorating though.  http://i.imgur.com/Heo9C8e.png
rct,3auka8,pallosalama,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:24:00 2015 UTC,"Aw, you got rid of the loops. :( You could have put brakes there to slow the train down if that is where your vertical Gs were a bit excessive. I would recommend trains not exceed 45MPH before entering loops of that size.  Decorations, going underground, nearby paths, or nearby foliage increase excitement rating because it makes the illusion the riders are going to crash but don't. I'm no decoration expert because I tend to just build the coasters without much thought how to decorate it."
rct,3auka8,MrBrightside711,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:43:34 2015 UTC,My carts shoot out the other way. The loops are the last thing they take and they took them really slowly. As others have also said what caused the problem was the very beginning where the coasters went too fast through non-slanted corners.  Also i've come to the conclusion the loops didn't really fit anyway. Those in-line twists i put it are a lot better and don't need as much speed.
rct,3auka8,NICKisICE,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:47:19 2015 UTC,You could try adding volcanoes inside those helixes/half-helixes.

rct,3asfap,navalin,1 point,Tue Jun 23 11:33:56 2015 UTC,"Just a little comment on the suspended coaster, suspended coasters generally have very few hills like that, usually none unless there is a turn at the top or bottom (therefore not really making it an air hill. I can image the reasoning is that the way the carts swing it would not be comfortable if pressure was put upwards because the carts would be pushed to the side."

rct,3as65q,otsdarva,3,Tue Jun 23 02:43:46 2015 UTC,"Ok I'll provide more information. The limit is 254 roller coasters, rides, or stalls. That means a restroom takes up the same count as a roller coaster. The best way is to minimize the number of stalls. There are some custom stalls where multiple items are sold like the pizza and soda stall thereby effectively reducing the need to use another ride slot for the same result."
rct,3as65q,OlafNoChuujo,2,Tue Jun 23 02:51:20 2015 UTC,"Right, I think it's actually 255 (a ""short"" variable)  When you have a huge park, though, you have to have stalls pretty frequently, else guests die of starvation and other crap. But you do have a point.  That guy just seemed to nonchalantly just change the limit on the employees, so I figured it'd be just as easy for rides.  There aren't any Steam mods for it either?"

rct,3an1os,navalin,12,Sun Jun 21 21:08:54 2015 UTC,"Like this: http://i.imgur.com/HjSbauK.png  The second drop is lower than the first one. Also i just realized i can convert savegames to scenarios, so here's the scenario where half the rollercoaster is underground. Sorta like that RCT 1 scenario which was my big inspiration: http://www.mediafire.com/download/ie5sqsc26u363ye/OUATITW.zip  Maybe someone else can actually do something interesting instead of my own pathetic attempts."
rct,3an1os,navalin,5,Sun Jun 21 22:30:26 2015 UTC,"Okay, now that's pretty sweet. In the other one it looked like the second chain hill was at the same height as the stations haha. If you seriously want to finish this, I'd probably recommend taking down the land surrounding the mine a lot. You've got a pretty cool coaster but you can't see it much, so make it pop. You could probably get away with the stations only being 10-15 feet below the main land."
rct,3an1os,navalin,3,Sun Jun 21 22:37:30 2015 UTC,Lowering the land is is probably a smart thing to do. Thing is the park is full of guests at the moment since i had to convert a savegame into scenario. Is it possible to get rid of all the guests with some kind of tool? Is it also possible to edit the scenario so i can lower all the land in the whole scenario with 1 click?  Cause right now i got a monk's task ahead of me.
rct,3an1os,ryannayr140,2,Sun Jun 21 23:33:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, download 8cars from nedesigns.com or the wiki. You can use the Map Object Manipulation under the Misc. menu to lower all sandy ground by the same amount (probably lower by 14 or 16 units; make sure with land you only do even units). You're right that you'll probably have to bring this back into the scenario editor in order to get the guest spawn points at the right level."
rct,3an1os,pallosalama,2,Sun Jun 21 23:36:55 2015 UTC,"Well fuck, the only way i can edit the scenario editer is by loading the landscape of the scenario, but that means the rollercoasters are gone. Any other way i can't edit the landscape. And i can't lower the park entrance period. And editing the landscape scenario, after which i'd rebuild the rollercoasters doesn't work either, because the rollercoasters are partly underground.  I think i'm fucked."

I think I like the normal layout a little better, the queue isn't quite as long, but people that liked the ride can easily hop back on."

rct,3an61g,NotAThrowaway534891,1 point,Mon Jun 29 11:36:59 2015 UTC,"IMO the awnings over the parts that go underground compromise the aesthetics of the station, it looks awkward. I'd say put that cool grass stuff on top instead of the roof piece and then put the wall back where it was (behind the roof piece, where there is no longer a wall)."

rct,3alxjp,mintlou,8,Sun Jun 21 14:51:57 2015 UTC,"You have to start small. There will come a time where you will have to sit there, not building anything and wait for money no matter what strategy you use.  I start with stalls and cheap gentle rides. A good but unethical tactic is to charge the max price (something like $20) for umbrellas. Eventually it will rain and you will reap the harvest, so to speak.  The key to a good start is to not build a huge coaster, imo.  Edit: also, do not use all of your loan money. And never take an extra loan unless you are in danger of losing. Paying off your loan is essential to getting money!! Monthly interest on that 35 grand will kill your park's budget."
rct,3alxjp,Hello_There2,3,Sun Jun 21 14:54:47 2015 UTC,"Just adding to the coaster start here:  If you build one, make sure it's got a really high capacity. Don't build a wild mouse or flying coaster. Build a wooden or looping with multiple block sections so you can really bring in the dough."
rct,3alxjp,zeph_yr,2,Sun Jun 21 17:08:47 2015 UTC,"Flying coasters have decent capacity - up to 28 people per train. This is slightly less than some of the other B&M rides which allow 8 car trains, but it's not nearly as bad as a wild mouse, which I agree is a poor choice for a first coaster."
rct,3alxjp,X7123M3-256,2,Sun Jun 21 17:59:42 2015 UTC,I meant the Mini-suspended flying coaster. Forgot there was one called the flying coaster too
rct,3alxjp,zeph_yr,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:36:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's an awful choice of ride. Any of the single rider coasters are unlikely to make much profit, even with absurd numbers of block sections."
rct,3alxjp,X7123M3-256,6,Sun Jun 21 20:46:35 2015 UTC,"The first thing I do on some of the larger scenarios where you have to build from scratch is to remove the paths leading out into the other end of the park. At the initial stages, you don't want 50 guests spread over the park wandering aimlessly. If you have a smaller initial area set out for the peeps to walk around, they'll be going on your rides more and spend less time walking around getting bored.  Once you have set a smaller area for them to walk around, I like to plop down thrill rides like the Pirate Ship, Twist, Inverted Pirate Ship, Enterprise or Top Spin (depending what you start with). You can increase rotations to improve the ratings if you like. I tend to find thrill rides draw in most peeps whereas some gentle rides are ignored by peeps for not being thrilling enough. I like to increase the price on them as well (normally between the $2 - $2.50 mark) to get a bit more income. These rides are cheap to build, have a few different ones (and maybe a gentle ride) at the start and you'll start making money without eating up all your initial funds.  A small coaster is not a bad idea either. Avoid the temptation to chew through all your money on a large coaster, stick to something simple but still has good excitement ratings. You can charge a little more for these and the peeps are normally all over it.   If you want to employ some cheese, you can use cheap powered launch coaster designs which are short duration rides that will earn plenty of income. Set two side by side and tick the ""wait for adjacent stations"" box and watch money pour in.   As the park then develops I gradually start building outward by adding back paths I originally closed off to avoid crowding. By doing this, you can support growth over time without losing control of your park. Make sure each ""section"" you develop has a mix of rides, stalls, amenities as well as benches/bins. I normally follow this kind of strategy and it ensures a high park rating as well as strong income. Make use of marketing once you have a good income to drive new peeps into the park (with full wallets of course)."
rct,3alxjp,Mamong,1 point,Sun Jun 21 15:38:14 2015 UTC,"Gradually widening the field to build on is very important.  As a beginner, I too started with all outgoing paths blocked off. But then I crammed the remaining space full with rides and did not expand quickly enough which led to lots of annoyed peeps (due to crowding) and a low park rating, therefore dropping revenue."
rct,3alxjp,yayachiken,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:51:06 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't it be more practical if you just deployed ""No entry"" -banners at certain points in the beginning? So you would save the effort of removing most of the paths and later rebuilding them.  Unless you really need that money from the paths. Or extra space."
rct,3alxjp,pallosalama,2,Wed Jun 24 04:15:45 2015 UTC,That still lets mechanics and handymen (without patrol areas) wander off into the blocked zones.  It's enough just to remove one tile of path.
rct,3alxjp,ConfidenceManTwo,1 point,Thu Jun 25 11:40:05 2015 UTC,Good point.
rct,3alxjp,pallosalama,5,Thu Jun 25 13:44:54 2015 UTC,"In pay-per-ride scenerios, I always start by building a coaster. Not necessarily a big one - usually somewhere in the £5000-£10000 range. Coasters have much more capacity than flat rides, and you can often get away with charging £10 per ride for a brand new one - I've had guests pay as much as £20 for a very large one. You have to remember to adjust the price down as the ride ages though, otherwise the guests will completely abandon it.   You want to design the block system such that there's always a train waiting in the brake run by the time each train leaves the station - this might require putting in more blocks than you would usually see on real coaster. I usually set the minimum waiting time to zero, especially on rides without a block system such as log flumes. I also make sure to place the entrance near the front of the station, so the trains load quickly. This is especially important on rides without a block system, such as log flumes, where the time guests spend boarding is a major influence on the capacity of the ride, which is the biggest factor determining how much money you'll make on it.  A coaster will typically break even within a few years if you make sure it's always filled to capacity and always charge the highest price you can get away with before the guests start refusing to ride. If your coaster takes 28 people per train, costs £10 per ride, and you run three trains, then you are making £840 per cycle.  If the cash machine is not available at the beginning of the scenario, I set research to maximum and only research shops and stalls until it's unlocked. A park full of high-capacity coasters is useless if all your guests can't afford to ride them. Once the cash machine is unlocked I concentrate research on coasters.  Pay for entry scenarios are harder, and I still really suck at them. The number of guests in your park is a function of the number of rides you have, and while coasters will attract more guests than flat rides, they probably won't attract enough new guests to make back the cost of the coaster, so building exclusively coasters in a pay-per-entry scenario isn't as attractive a strategy, particularly at the beginning of the scenario when you have limited cash.  If the guests are happy, they won't leave often, which creates a problem, because once your park has filled to capacity, you need guests to leave so new ones can enter. One way around this is periodically close and reopen the park. Another solution is to make sure your guests are unhappy and leave quickly, usually be omitting toilets or food stalls. Doing this means you have to put up with endless complaints from guests - I tend to avoid using either of these tricks.  Marketing increases the number of guests entering the park, so as soon as I can afford to I usually have every available marketing campaign running continuously - this can generate a usable amount of income once the park is decently sized, but it's not the same as the pay-per-ride case where a large park will make money faster than you could possibly spend it.  One way to get cheap coasters with decent ratings is to build lots of fake shuttle coasters. These cost about a third the cost of a full circuit ride with similar ratings. The amount of theming needed to make them look decent pushes the price up, but you can always add that later (or not add it at all if you don't care how the park looks). These rides have abysmal capacity though, so they're not a good choice in pay-per-ride parks. Normal shuttle coasters, if available, are also good, but don't tend to get quite as good ratings (but they do have better capacity and don't look ridiculous)"

rct,3alxjp,thachicoo,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:22:29 2015 UTC,"I like to start with a lot of cheap thrill rides, and then move up to coasters later.  Someone else mentioned the ""umbrella cheat"" and it really works - charge insane amounts of money for an umbrella, and people will buy them when it rains. Free $$$  Constantly twiddle your prices. Check the guest's thoughts tab, and if a bunch of people are thinking ""Scrambled Eggs 1 is really good value!"" bump the price up a little. Of course you don't want people to start thinking ""I'm not paying that much to go into Scrambled Eggs 1"", so that's when you know to bump it back down a little."
rct,3alxjp,scratchisthebest,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:28:20 2015 UTC,"I feel your pain, OP. I have a hard time playing some of RCT2's scenarios because the concept of charging for rides seems so strange to me. In RCT I'd just charge a flat fee for entry to the park, concessions, and have all the rides be free.  I don't know how you feel about prebuilts, but it might be worthwhile to find some good cheap designs for rollercoasters. If you're not fond of using other people's work you can tinker around with the track editor. Try to get a good balance of size, cost, and the ratings.  There's a big difference in terms of cost between building and testing a good coaster while the game is running and just plopping down something from a file."
