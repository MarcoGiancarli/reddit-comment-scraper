pokemontrades,3e431q,ajkyle56,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:32:57 2015 UTC,I'm really only after the lab codes.  I don't have any Korea Jirachi or Darkrai though :/ Aegi + Pika for a set? I could add something else just don't know what.
pokemontrades,3e431q,ajkyle56,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:34:49 2015 UTC,Hey would u do ur olleh chari + aegelish ? For 1 set lab code ?
pokemontrades,3e431q,ajkyle56,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:36:14 2015 UTC,Thats a little steep for me. Would you add 1 Manaphy and 1 Shaymin for both?
pokemontrades,3e431q,ajkyle56,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:38:33 2015 UTC,No
pokemontrades,3e431q,ajkyle56,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:29:09 2015 UTC,Something else? Olleh + Aegi is too much for just the Lab codes.
pokemontrades,3e431q,ajkyle56,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:31:25 2015 UTC,For lab code set ?
pokemontrades,3e431q,matthewtunc,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:53:01 2015 UTC,Yes. If you want to add 1 Manaphy code I will do the trade though.
