drumcorps,3e0f77,madd227,6,Tue Jul 21 02:47:55 2015 UTC,Regionals were certainly cheaper for a struggling corps. They could do a month and a half worth of shows and only travel just a few hours from home each time.
drumcorps,3e0f77,Puntifex_Maximus,2,Tue Jul 21 02:52:16 2015 UTC,Forgive me because I'm fairly new to drum corps but what exactly was the purpose of regional circuits and why do you think they are necessary for activity's survival?
drumcorps,3e0f77,madd227,4,Tue Jul 21 05:09:44 2015 UTC,"Many moons ago, you had a number of regional circuits who did their own local tour set up that was cheaper and less of a time commitment. It also gave groups the ability to have a big capstone event for there season.  Now local groups like Legends, Genesis and now the Louisiana Stars  don't do full DCI tours, which is fine, but they miss out on having a nice big event season ender, unless they are able to make it to a DCI Major Show.  Local circuits can give more people the ability to march, and give them achievable goals. That is good for organizations as saying ""we won class A at DCF (drum corps florida (a guy can dream))"" is easy better than having to say ""oh got 21st out of 21"" at this DCI Regional.  More people in drum corps is only a good thing. If we want to see the outdoor activity thrive, then we need to create more fans. And the best fans are people who have marched. (Not to insult those who never could if course)"

drumcorps,3e0f77,RodeoPrince,2,Tue Jul 21 21:30:56 2015 UTC,"My rookie year was 2003, when DCM temporarily became DCI-Midwest. Despite the ""hand-off"" (the full details of which remain a mystery to me, maybe someone else knows), there didn't seem to be much difference with prior years. We still had the championship in DeKalb, along with the I&E freeday ... still one of my fondest drum corps memories.  Besides walking around NIU watching I&E performances, there were also some quirky feats-of-strength competitions that were fun to be in. These included ...   Tug-of-war 4-way-tug-of-war Bus pushing (Capital Sound usually won because they actually practiced on their similarly constructed busses)   There were other aspects from my limited exposure to DCM that I don't miss. The judging sheets were stupid (everyone on the same sheets ... including all-age corps). Also a few tiny show sites that had no business hosting competitions.  After the 2003 experiment, there was a decisive vote by every member corps. According to this article, it looks like the Division I groups not named ""Pioneer"" decided to split from DCM. Pioneer was the Division I champion in the last years of DCM.  I'm pretty ambivalent about the regional model being the savior of drum corps. The argument that it keeps costs low and benefits small/developing corps seems valid, but there's also the matter getting people to come out to shows. There's something to be said for attracting national groups.  With all that said, I wish DCI would have a bus pushing competition. I'd like to see the Blue Devils try excelling at that."
drumcorps,3e0f77,Dauntit,2,Tue Jul 21 06:18:43 2015 UTC,"Tug-of-War, volleyball, and the massive food line when all of the cook trucks lined up to serve everyone are some of my fondest memories of marching."

The pay scale was equal (formula-wise) inasmuch the score (area) obtained at the prior DCM championship plus the amount of members on the field was the formula to determine a pay scale.  In short, the higher a corps scored plus the amount of members on the field determined the pay scale for each corps--for the next season.  If I recall, there were issues on the type of sheets being used in comparison with the sheets the DCI shows used (post the DCM Championships), and a bunch of other stuff.  I was at the meeting as a representative of The Kilties when the decision (vote) was made to revert back to the DCM model vrs the ""trial run"" DCI Central model.  So............."

The ""one corps = one vote"" wasn't presented as a ""set in stone"" option being on the table in continuing as DCI Central.    Thus, the Div 2/3 and all-age corps felt they would have no assurance of control in (at least) being a voice in steering their own future."

drumcorps,3e0txj,BrainGoesPop,5,Tue Jul 21 12:35:43 2015 UTC,That is the key difference too.  I am slowly warming to electronics (albeit VERY reluctantly) but if your show suffers because of a blown breaker or some other malfunction then that is not the spirit of DCI.  Electronics should be the frame you used for your grand painting.  You can still hang your painting on the wall if someone forgets to bring the frame to the gallery.
drumcorps,3e0txj,Elfman72,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:20:11 2015 UTC,"I agree for sure, but I think, even without the electronics the Bluecoats brass will blow you away.

drumcorps,3e14tn,Elussive,2,Tue Jul 21 04:12:41 2015 UTC,Thanks for the help I'll look further into each corps specifications.
drumcorps,3e14tn,Elussive,3,Tue Jul 21 04:16:06 2015 UTC,"Enjoy the little things. I was head of field lining crew for Golden Empire and I would have to wake up the rest of the crew and one of the Drum Majors to go line some fields. We would always wake up before the break of dawn and I would always take a moment to marvel at some of the beautiful sunrises. The sunrise would make me excited for the day even through some of the toughest days. Just enjoy the little things on tour. It really helps you make it through your wall.  Also, water. If you feel chopped out, drink water. Always have your jug full at the beginning of ever block. And at show sites at least half full (We had to lug our jugs around and I made the mistake of lugging around a full water jug at one show on my arm with my shako. Needless to say my arm was shaking the entire performance and I only filled my jug halfway from then on. It would last me through warm up block and through the bus ride to the next housing site."

drumcorps,3dwy9e,sprinklerbirthday,16,Mon Jul 20 05:38:26 2015 UTC,"Sounds like horse crap to me and that way of thinking is counterproductive to the corps as a whole. Everyone should be more worried about performing their show together, cleaning together and representing the corps together. Having more experience than someone else does not make you better than them. I've met many a rookie that marched and played better than plenty of vets. Because you've marched somewhere longer does not mean you get special treatment in terms of being a corps member. I get sitting in the back of the bus or being in specific spots in a retreat block but at the end of the day you're all corps members and you all have to do your part to better the corps you're representing both on and off the field."
drumcorps,3dwy9e,Yaksha25,11,Mon Jul 20 07:21:02 2015 UTC,"There's a big difference to me between a ""vet"" and a ____ year rookie. A vet should be a leader on and off the field, and should be able to be used as an example in any facet of the activity.    A vet would have done their job when they were told, and that would be that. A second year rookie would tell first year members to do the job for them.   A vet would only speak on the field if someone higher up told them to help police up ___ (rehearsal technique, so and so's direction change when they're in front of you). A third year rookie would disregard what the staff has said because they [rookies] know better.   I am a big believer that as a rookie, you should have very little to say on the field. This does not mean you should never talk... But corrections are not something a rookie should worry about, and yelling about rehearsal etiquette is not something a rookie should worry about. Comments can be made discretely and easily to leadership and staff during any break at all or just by raising the hand and asking a question.     So no, I do not fully agree with the ""policy"" your corps has in place. Your concerns are not unfounded, and I think that this would be a perfect opportunity to pull the horn sergeant aside and explain to him/her your feelings on the matter. Maybe, have them and a staff member available when you talk."
drumcorps,3dwy9e,ThatOtherOneGuy,5,Mon Jul 20 09:26:10 2015 UTC,"Was this ""meeting"" official?  Or an immature ""power trip"" (meeting) held by vets or ""green"" staff?  When one answers those two questions---you'll know what to do in moving forward."
drumcorps,3dwy9e,Dauntit,4,Mon Jul 20 09:17:05 2015 UTC,"I am on the BOD for an Open Class corps and we run our day to day operations as volunteers as well. I am also an alum of this corps. I'm horrified at the mentality that vets would treat rookies so callously or that the staff would not only tolerate it but encourage it. In our corps, the vets are seen as leaders who help mentor the rookies in areas where they need assistance IF THEY DEMONSTRATE THOSE LEADERSHIP QUALITIES. That does not make them in charge of anything, not does it earn them automatic respect.   We have and would continue to bust down on any member who shirks their responsibilities. That's just pure laziness, and it will spread like disease. Sorry, OP, that you're experiencing it."
drumcorps,3dwy9e,stargazercmc,5,Mon Jul 20 11:57:54 2015 UTC,"if what you say is accurate, i'm just going to guess that member retention is/will be an issue.   if that's the goal, then well done to the corps."
drumcorps,3dwy9e,CreativePhilosopher,3,Mon Jul 20 15:56:43 2015 UTC,"This sort of thing would annoy the fire out of me as a rookie/member. So to answer your question: I do not agree with that system of doing things and I would absolutely not want to march somewhere where that happens.   For me vets should be recognized for their leadership qualities, especially on the field during rehearsal and obviously bus seating type privileges. But not when it comes to your responsibilities, if anything they should be leading the charge on these things. So it's seems like this systems is a really good way to ensure that things don't get accomplished.   So basically at Bloo we do exactly these things. I really don't have a problem with any of it. Vets lead various crews and help ensure that everything runs smoothly and if anyone shirks their responsibility it is vets and rookies equally as often!"
drumcorps,3dwy9e,Butterfee,3,Mon Jul 20 08:25:17 2015 UTC,"I've heard that once spring training starts, the Blue Devils ban words like ""rookie"" and ""vet"".   I think there should be a happy medium between the two. Some vets stand out as being really helpful and are people you should listen to. On the other hand, being experienced doesn't automatically make you any better or more powerful than the rest of the group. I think for the most part, the people who you should listen to will have that respect without even asking for it, and the vets who complain about not getting that respect don't deserve it.   My corps is very different because almost no one has previous DCI experience, but many people have extensive marching band experience (some people have 8+ years marching experience plus teaching experience). Some of the rookies are actually much more helpful than some of the vets."
drumcorps,3dwy9e,yankeesfan13,2,Mon Jul 20 16:48:32 2015 UTC,There's obviously a failure of leadership if the leaders are having to outline to the membership who is in charge.    I don't think an arbitrary amount of experience should out you in a position of authority.  Chosen leaders such as drum majors are a different story though.
drumcorps,3dwy9e,cl0ckwork,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:53:20 2015 UTC,"The Cadets rarely if ever take time to acknowledge vets in a way superior to rookies, and the fact that we are all expected to be treated on the relatively same plane really reduces the amount of ""this many years"" bullshit that should frankly just be cut out of the process entirely. Given a rookie may not know things and may make ""stupid"" mistakes, but when you actually assess it they dont really work any differently from a vet. A vet just knows the details. In my opinion, they dont have a right to moderate the process (save for section leaders)."
drumcorps,3dwy9e,intramortem,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:57:40 2015 UTC,"I've never marched but it seems to me that in Open Class you could easily have a 15 year ""vet"" and a 20 year old rookie. Aint no way in hell a 15 year old is going to be bossing around a 20 year old - just be realistic about it for a second.  Early on I can see vets, regardless of age, helping guide newbies in the ways of the particular corps but everyone works just as hard as everyone else and by tour time, everyone's a ""vet"".  Section leaders who are assigned the position by staff are different than just a regular old vet I would think.  They're like Jr Staff."

drumcorps,3dt5z2,ports84,7,Sun Jul 19 05:27:04 2015 UTC,"Last year they added another percussion judge who's in the box judge percussion ensemble, but they're usually only at regionals (or exclusively at regionals, I don't know). It's not a front ensemble specific judge, unless they changed it this year, but it does benefit the front ensemble greatly, scoring wise."

There is subtlety, complexity, groove and beauty in this show. There really isn't that much synth overpowering like these comments would suggest - yes, a couple key moments where the effects take more of a spotlight, but it's hardly most of the show and I think they are used to great effect.  I don't see how any discerning music fan could come to the conclusion that this show is ""just random synth noises,"" I'm sorry."

drumcorps,3dsw9k,the_crown_fits,8,Sun Jul 19 07:43:50 2015 UTC,They shouldn't have to handle it though. It's not like there's any defense in drum corps which prevents other corps from doing well so why would you boo a corps that works just as hard as everyone else?

drumcorps,3dsw9k,the_crown_fits,2,Sun Jul 19 22:37:02 2015 UTC,"Because in the example you gave, Red Sox fans wanting the Yankees to ""lose every game"" is completely different scenario. In baseball and other ""ball sports"" there is one team going against the other and each team tries to inhibit the other's chances of succeeding, aka ""defense"". In drum corps there is none of that, it's just a bunch of different groups of people going out and trying their best to impress a group of people for a bunch of numbers. Booing the judges because you think one group should be ahead of the other comes across as you booing the group that won, no matter what your intentions are."
drumcorps,3dsw9k,dupio,-1,Sun Jul 19 23:46:39 2015 UTC,"Lol that's patronizing (aka ""defense""). I don't see the difference.

I'd like to see BD take back first just to keep things exciting at the top.   I think Phantom will pass Cavaliers. Maybe not tonight, but by finals definitely.   I'd like to see BK and Troopers climb.   Really curious where Boston falls tonight too.   The recaps from tonight and Atlanta will be the most telling scores to give us an idea of finals week.   Also interesting score to note: in 2011 Cadets placed 3rd in San Antonio by .6, then went on to win it all, so for anyone saying finals are set don't be so sure, especially this season with how crazy the captions are."

drumcorps,3dqkxd,G_Mahler,0,Sun Jul 19 03:10:34 2015 UTC,Really wish Cadets hadn't wasted such awesome repertoire and execution on such an un-entertaining  concept. Numbers just aren't fun.
drumcorps,3dqkxd,DJWintoFresh,7,Sun Jul 19 03:10:42 2015 UTC,It's barely a concept. It doesn't need one. Just listen. Just like Tilt is barely a concept. Same idea.
drumcorps,3dqkxd,G_Mahler,2,Sun Jul 19 03:26:57 2015 UTC,"True, and I didn't mean for my comment to sound like I didn't thoroughly enjoy Cadet's show.  The music is phenomenal, the marching is stellar (that closer tho), but I just wished they had taken all that and put it in the context of something refreshing.  Tilt was a very loose concept, but fans went nuts because it showed us something...different.    So as a long time fan, I greatly appreciate the product on the field.  I just wish that the brilliant (saying in all sincerity) design staff had come up with something less bland to set the stage.  The concept seems like something I would get in the mail from an ""all-in-one"" marching band design company."
drumcorps,3dqkxd,DJWintoFresh,2,Sun Jul 19 14:40:45 2015 UTC,"I understand your point. I'd wager that the design staff intentionally kept the concept minimal to highlight the music.   Take PR '08 for example. Amazing show. Full concept. Did anyone care what the music was? I won't speak for others, but I know I never even looked it up.  Tilt? Yup. I looked up every Tyondai Braxton piece I could find and then played Hymn of Acxiom on repeat for days."

drumcorps,3dqkxd,run_like_an_antelope,2,Sun Jul 19 15:21:05 2015 UTC,"Yes. There were several things missing from the opener that really left it feeling flat. Re-watching the video, you can see their synth/loop guy leave the pit, walk to the backfield 50 (where their snake and generator are), then walk back.

drumcorps,3dpcfi,Thrownout738,7,Sat Jul 18 03:58:09 2015 UTC,"Try not to take it personally.  If it's coming from the instructors, they are probably just not very experienced at teaching yet.  If it's other corps members, it is likely the stress of being on the road and dehydration.  Many people have experienced similar situations in small corps which aren't so well run.  It happens, but try to focus on the positive memories rather than the negative.  Or turn the negative ones into funny stories."
drumcorps,3dpcfi,bluedog144,2,Sat Jul 18 10:56:39 2015 UTC,"If the negativity is coming mostly from other members, you might want to check yourself. Ask your section leader if they have any advice. If it's coming from staff, you might want to look for another corps next year. A little negative reinforcement can be an effective tool. A lot of it means the staff is clueless of how to get things done."
drumcorps,3dpcfi,asdf072,2,Sat Jul 18 06:41:13 2015 UTC,"smaller open class corps tend to have younger (down to 14 years old) members and no offense to my youthful friends, but younger people tend to have more personality issues - because they're less mature.

Also ask yourself are you doing anything that may make people frustrated with you from a team perspective? Do you show up late? Know all your music? Do you do your tour job? If you skimp on things others pick up your slack on tour and it can get frustrating. More often than not if people are angry around you on tour its because of something you're doing, or not doing. Hope this helps and anything I can do to help don't hesitate to ask."

I'm not a fan of drum line battle, but I like soundsport because it is like a mini version of DCI/DCA. It's a great place for either a musician or a corps to start. I expect that some corps will grow out of it and into DCA/DCI open class.   I also like SDCA. A lot of older musicians and a whole lot of variety, but still very cool. A lot more focus on music than visual. If you like old school DCI, you'd probably like SDCA. Lots of G bugles. SDCA also helps the corps a lot; from what I've heard, a corps can afford to travel a few hours away and stay overnight at a gym or school or something and still make a profit after travel expenses and food."

drumcorps,3dmqy8,DannyMk,15,Fri Jul 17 15:08:43 2015 UTC,"I think for a non-percussionist with untrained ears, the easy way is visually.    Watch the snare line as their sticks move up and down.  Are they all going the same height with the same degree of stick rotation?  Is the blur of their sticks matching between one drummer and another?  A good line will have everyone playing with uniform stick heights and the stroke from each drummer would also be uniform.  Typically look at the Snare(s) in the middle and the Snare's on the edge to see the biggest discrepancies.  The Center snare typically being your strongest player and the line builds out from the middle.  If the sticks aren't moving the same speed and traveling the same distance, they will not be in sync with each other.  You'll see this difference more with a weaker line than with a stronger line.    If you watch the Tenors you will see the same thing as described above with the Snares but also add the horizontal movement.  Do they all move horizontally from drum to drum the same amount?  Do they hit consistently in the same spots on the drum as the other members of the section?  I think of tenor parts, especially those with lots of scrapes and crosses as being a choreographed dance performed with your hands/mallets.  You can see when someone is out of sync just as you would the colorguard holding a big 'ole flag.  Basses can be much harder to detect good from bad for the novice.  At some levels you can listen for the evenness of their strokes as they move the part from one drum to another.  Though the part might call for unevenness and odd patterns so you don't know if it's wrong or meant to be that way without knowing their part.  You can watch whichever side you can see's mallets on unison parts to see that they are all working the same speed and such.  The problem is that due to splits, basses typically aren't playing the same things so that isn't reliable.  You might be better off just watching the whole bass line and see if people flinch if/when they make mistakes.  If a line has cymbals, this is easy to figure out as the visuals should lineup/match in some degree.  Now if you try to hear it with your ears, a bad line will have a sound that is described as fuzzy or dirty.  What you are hearing is multiple players of a section not striking the drum head at the exact moment.  As the whole line, they would need to attack a note at the same time.  You can hear it not being precise."

drumcorps,3dmqy8,wifimax1,3,Fri Jul 17 17:53:36 2015 UTC,Awesome response. Do you think you could link an example of really good snares and on the other hand some slightly out of sync snares?
drumcorps,3dmqy8,UselessGadget,3,Sat Jul 18 00:10:23 2015 UTC,"Here is Genesis Drumline.  This is from drumline battle so the competition is a lot looser than a strict drum corps competition or what you'd see in the lot somewhere.  But I'm going to use it as an example for both.  I find this really hard to be negative and critique them as such as they'd blow away any line that I have ever taught, though I can still see issues that could use some attention.  I'm sure others will argue what I see or bring up other issues... sure, go ahead.  I'm not the greatest by any means, I just taught for a few years.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YZ4eCIOHYs  I'd watch the whole thing first, and see what you think.  Then go to the spots that I bring up and see if you notice them.  Check out at 1:10.  The two tenors that are in the frame have two completely different techniques.  They are kinda bobbing around and being loose, but the stick heights and are off.  When they come out of the groove section, the tenor on the left has much higher stick heights.    At 1:40 the Snare on the left looks like his muscles are tightening up compared to the closest snare to the camera when he's playing his accents.    At 3:00 on the tenor solo, during scrapes, the player closest does not match the other 3 players.  He's hitting the rims instead of the heads.  3:14 bass solo.  Rhythmically this is pretty straight forward for a bass solo.  Doubles for two counts down and up the drums, then triples for two counts down and up the drums.  Then 32nds for a count, rim click, back up as 32nds and solo over.  Bass 1 (the smallest one) during the triple section crushes his three notes together.  I'm not sure if you'll hear it, but it's just a little tiny studder.  3:40 So they are playing some parts where the sticking (the order which they play each stick) isn't a typical R L R L R L.  They've got some diddles and some rhythms they are playing.  The first roll, directly at 3:40 is ""dirty"".  Then they do another roll at 3:41 which is much cleaner.  Anyway, hope that helps."
drumcorps,3dmqy8,UselessGadget,2,Sat Jul 18 00:55:55 2015 UTC,"Another good one.  This one has two lined up against each other.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGJi72owJ8M  I give this one to Gold.  I personally cannot stand when you go to a drum off and one of the lines plays 8 on a hand (what 7th Regiment played at the very beginning).  Even worse, when they play a part of their show that has parts that are meant for the winds to carry the band.  You are wasting your moment to shine.    As for critique...  They all move around to much to really see a whole lot.  But notice the snare on the far right of 7th Regiment compared to the center snares when it comes to technique on the first cadence."
drumcorps,3dmqy8,Brown-Thunder,6,Sat Jul 18 01:11:30 2015 UTC,"Listen. Do eight snares sound like one snare (good) or like eight snares (meh)?

drumcorps,3dmqy8,Shredder13,5,Fri Jul 17 16:22:47 2015 UTC,Most high school lines are pretty desperate for numbers where I teach.
drumcorps,3dmqy8,Jehu920,2,Fri Jul 17 19:40:04 2015 UTC,Even still to go right into winter as a snare would be extremely difficult.
drumcorps,3dmqy8,shortrug,2,Fri Jul 17 20:28:19 2015 UTC,"My experience marching in a winter line that was ""desperate for numbers"" was that you still had to have chops to make snare or tenors. If there are only 4 kids with chops, they'll only have 4 flat drums.  My high school never had more than 3 snares and 2 tenors but I still had to work my way up and practice like hell to get on tenors."
drumcorps,3dmqy8,WarmDry,2,Sun Jul 19 18:37:44 2015 UTC,"I'm aware, haha.  But I'm mostly looking for things to listen for in particular Jehu920.  I probably should have clarified, but this is only for personal knowledge, I'm not looking to be a ""professional"" judge of any sorts."
drumcorps,3dmqy8,Jehu920,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:28:04 2015 UTC,"Next time you watch a tape, listen in closely. Did they start together? Did they play together? Did they end together? Most corps have the start/stop thing figured out, so the real challenge is playing together.    I'll use this vid of the Buccaneers that I saw elsewhere on this sub today. I don't mean to call anyone out, but this should provide a decent contrast. If you listen to the Tenor feature at 1:15, you'll hear that they start clean. They play so well together, that for all I know, only one tenor is playing. Towards the end of the feature, you'll hear them start to get a little hazy.   That haziness is what judges look for when they need to separate Outstanding from Phenomenal."

I marched Cavaliers his age out year, and was in Escapade (winter guard he put together that IMO, put him firmly in the limelight of great designers).   Nicest, sweetest guy I know.   Miss the hell out of him since I am in Texas, and he doesn't get down here much."
drumcorps,3dkya8,thatcamjamguy,17,Fri Jul 17 02:49:06 2015 UTC,"From what I know from my Cavalier friends from that era, many very important staff members didn't agree with the board of directors when they removed Jeff Fiedler from his position. When Jeff transitioned to SCV, he brought many great minds and talented staff with him (mostly visual/brass), while other important staff members left the activity or are present elsewhere. In 2011, Michael Gaines departed from the visual design team, a change that took a massive blow to their identity. When you take extremely important people out of an organization whose ""framework"" rely on tradition and brotherhood, nobody wins. Maybe one day they will return for their second 15 minutes of fame."
drumcorps,3dkya8,MomentOfCrisis,5,Fri Jul 17 04:41:39 2015 UTC,"It comes down to morals, and if the staff couldn't handle getting rid of Fiedler then it was right for them to leave as well."

drumcorps,3dkya8,Spandy428,2,Fri Jul 17 03:19:34 2015 UTC,I'd guess this is a huge part of it. I can't speak for the percussion head but the brass arranger was brilliant; SCV is very lucky to have him.
drumcorps,3dkya8,msandovalabq,9,Fri Jul 17 04:11:43 2015 UTC,"The percussion head is Paul Rennick, and he's an incredible caption head. Phantom won or was near the top of every year, percussion-wise with Rennick until he went to SCV. In 2009, when Phantom had a rough follow-up to their championship year, percussion was their best category. Now SCV is a perennial favorite in the percussion category."

drumcorps,3dkya8,Spandy428,2,Fri Jul 17 03:17:37 2015 UTC,That makes so much sense. Just watching a video of their show this year I was scratching my head trying to think of why I wasn't a fan.
drumcorps,3dkya8,msandovalabq,6,Fri Jul 17 04:10:33 2015 UTC,"Staff change would be the main cause I believe. Their absolutely genius drill writer Michael Gaines left after 2011 (but later said in a podcast that it was only temporary, so we'll see). I'm not sure if anyone else left, but I assume others probably did. I don't really like to think that such a huge streak rested upon one man's shoulders by 2011. But if it did, it's a testament to the guy.   It definitely wasn't a loss of talent though. I've come to believe that staff is more important than talent level in the long run.   If anyone else has some deeper insight, I've been wondering the same thing that OP is."
drumcorps,3dkya8,roshoka,4,Fri Jul 17 03:40:55 2015 UTC,"This is the podcast. It is incredibly enlightening for any drill writer. But it is also good for just getting into the mind of Gaines, he even gives some insight to the Cavaliers' 2001 show."
drumcorps,3dkya8,roshoka,4,Fri Jul 17 03:48:45 2015 UTC,The entirety of the brass staff that was together from 2001-2009 left as well.  That was a pretty big loss.

In a well written show, the drill should emphasize at least one point. That's where I look if I pick up on it."
drumcorps,3dkswr,yankeesfan13,4,Fri Jul 17 02:05:31 2015 UTC,"See, the thing that I don't like about a visual focal point is that, very often, there's something really cool going on elsewhere at the same time. Xtraordinary is a pretty good example of this; during the upside-down tenor shenanigans, the front ensemble was playing a freaking amazing run which they split like a bass section. Also for the Madison Scouts, if you're not looking in the right place at the right time you'll miss the perennial tuba-flip-ripple."

The first time through I can easily say ""wow this is an awesome show, I love this part"" but I dont get to enjoy it as much.   That happened this year. I wasnt a huge fan of Bluecoats (which is weird because they're my favorite corps) or BD, but after watching both shows 2-3 times I am in love with both. I guess it has something to do with being able to connect with the music after hearing it a few times through"

drumcorps,3dkswr,InquisitiveLion,3,Fri Jul 17 03:24:20 2015 UTC,"I'm a mello player but also marched indoor cymbals (yeah, 20's), so it's usually listening for mello licks and searching around for cool stuff, then my eyes get distracted by the big ""oooohhhh shiny"" plates doing their release and reloads (except for SCV for some odd reason) and other cool stuff, especially during the drum breaks.  Then I wait to have my face torn off.  Still remember crown in 2013, they're playing what seems like as loud as they physically can, and then the mellos just turn it up a notch and, as a mello guy, goosebumps, the whole bit. That's some damn good playing...   Basically, there is too much talent on field to catch everything, that's why I like sitting up high, so I can't focus on detail as much."
drumcorps,3dkswr,phanfare,3,Fri Jul 17 05:53:35 2015 UTC,"I teach visual so I mainly watch how the brass forms move and evolve. I usually get excited over a perfect line rotation or a perfectly matched moving cover down, or an amazing horn snap. Usually disappointed if one or two people catch my attention cause they're out of a form or out of step."
drumcorps,3dkswr,Brian-Puccio,0,Fri Jul 17 07:31:02 2015 UTC,"Definitely. That's the thing I hate about watching ""lower-tier"" groups.

drumcorps,3dkswr,burgerbob22,3,Fri Jul 17 21:54:49 2015 UTC,"I let my eyes go out of focus so the movements on the field look less like individual people and more like one giant, morphing shape.  Also, you get visual cues of upcoming musical builds, so that helps with anticipation, sort of an /r/oddlysatisfying kinda thing."

If you're watching the weakest link I feel like that would tell you a lot more about the group than say, the best performer, but if you're watching an ""average"" member I feel like that would tell you the most about the group. Do you just pick a person at random and stick with them or do you try to find the weak link or what?"
drumcorps,3dkswr,flyoddd,2,Fri Jul 17 22:09:06 2015 UTC,"Usually just someone that catches my eye, either good or bad. Sometimes it will ruin a show for me, and sometimes it will make it better."
drumcorps,3dkswr,zdsmith,3,Fri Jul 17 22:20:24 2015 UTC,"I'm a former color guard performer, so I focus mostly on the guard - with my attention split between flag and weapon. I try to pay attention to the music quite a bit too though. I'm very musical and can definitely appreciate the big moments, where as the more subtle things may fly over my head. I also enjoy a good vis package overall. Cavies were my favorite corps for so long because of the insane drill they would put out year after year. SCV is definitely up there as a favorite of mine this year for that reason."
drumcorps,3dkswr,zdsmith,2,Fri Jul 17 15:52:54 2015 UTC,"I am a brass musician and for the longest time I listened to only brass and drill but recently I have begun to watch the guard a ton more. If you never watch the guard you are missing out on a lot in shows! I found that paying close attention to the guard, even if I am not quite sure of what they are doing technically, allows me to better understand the story that the show is trying to convey.   I also love watching only one area of the field. I get multiple viewings a season of most corps so I love picking a zone on the field, for example 40 to 40,  and focusing on whatever comes into that focus. This allows me to generally get a little of everything. Sometimes in these shows there is so much going on it's nice to force yourself to focus one area otherwise you get overwhelmed and really miss a ton. Great question by the way!"
drumcorps,3dkswr,zdsmith,2,Fri Jul 17 02:49:35 2015 UTC,I listen for musicianship and watch for execution.

drumcorps,3dlcr4,Convour,11,Fri Jul 17 05:10:59 2015 UTC,"The camps are in November and December. Unless you have extensive experience in a top-level (national champions) marching band, or a ridiculous university drumline, I can say with 99% confidence you are not ready. But that's ok.  I was the best drummer in my high school. Made other kids on the drumline look terrible. Had to have the music re-written for me because it wasn't challenging enough, we changed the tenor line solo to a me-only solo, stuff like that. I saw some videos of drum corps and was like ""wow, that looks great. I'm so much better than my high school line, I'll try out for this"".   I went to my first camp (The Cadets) in December after my Junior year of high school. It was the biggest eye-opener of my life. 80 people going for 2 tenor spots. 130 snare auditionees. Most were 20 or 21 years old. I was blown out of the water. I was probably in the worst 5% of kids there. I had no idea that there were so many people with so much talent, and even the best of them would not get the spot.   This experienced changed my life. I saw what real talent and real dedication was. The camp itself was great, I got 3 days of clinic-style instruction from an amazing staff. It was a glance into REAL drum corps life - get up at 8, breakfast, then be on your feet doing marching things for 14 hours. Do you love marching stuff enough to do it for 14 hours straight? For 3 months without stop? In the heat? After you're sore and tired from sleeping on the bus the previous night? Because that's what drum corps is.  They care more about your raw talent and your work ethic than where you came from, nothing is impossible. But you have to be better than the guy who marched Phantom Regiment for 4 years, and wants to age out with the Cadets. That guy already knows how to work, and he had the chops to make it in another corps. Know what you're up against. Go to a winter camp for the experience. Get motivated."
drumcorps,3dlcr4,legendofj,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:19:17 2015 UTC,"Hmm, this helps quite a bit actually. My band director is a drumline kind of guy, and wrote some incredibly challenging tenor music for me this year because he knows I can handle it and play it.   Whenever I hear about the long days and the camps, I always get excited. For some reason, it's something that I'm really looking forward to. Maybe it's just because I haven't done it yeah Haha.   I'm just going to have to practice my ass off constantly if I really want to get into a top corps. I'm not expecting to get into them my first year or anything, I was just kind of curious if it was possible.   I'm definitely going to try out for Legends this next year, though. Thanks for giving me some insight!"
drumcorps,3dlcr4,flyoddd,4,Fri Jul 17 16:37:39 2015 UTC,"Hi! Your questions are common and I will try to answer them the best I can. I'm on tour teaching so this may take a min to write on mobile.   I am not a drummer but I'd assume you need a strong grasp of rudiments and overall tone production. Those groups are pulling hundreds of other kids for limited perc spots. You need to consider would your experience and skill set be able to put you at one of the best in your age bracket in the world to make one of these corps. I'd suggest if your end goal is a top 5 corps try looking at smaller world or open class corps. The work you do will be no less and it will allow you to grow as a musician and a performer. Thst being said go try out for a corps you have nothing to lose! It's a fun and eye opening experience. I'd suggest getting private lessons and downloading the corps you are looking to joins audition packet. Many auditionees have this packet memorized first camp. The most important thing you can do is practice daily. I know it seems cliché but find a teacher, have them guide you towards your goals and see where you can go. There are a few ways to offset cost. The one overlooked most is to start saving now. You will need 3-5k to match a big world class corps. Start working  doing anything to begin to offset that. Corps also offer fundraising to help you but in my experience it doesn't offset much. Someone may be willing to sponsor you as well paying part or all of your fees.    Sorry this was long I'm on a bus and can't sleep. If there are any other questions I'd be glad to help."

I know a guy that marched 2 summers of Bluecoats before even coming to college, but he is insanely good for his age. It's possible. Get a private teacher and practice at least 2-3 hours a day outside of regular classes. Some groups offer scholarships, but for the most part I don't know of any way to lower the cost. You'll probably have to pay or fundraise for it."

I'm a brass guy personally, but I'm also going to be a junior this coming year. My dream corps has always been the Bluecoats, and I want to march with them at some point before I age out, but that's a long way away and those spots are really competitive. There's about a 99% chance I'll be auditioning at Legends for next year because it seems like a fantastic place to grow as a musician and really hone my skills. You said you're in Michigan, right? Legends is in Kalamazoo, you should consider coming out and giving open class a try."

In a more traditional corps, I can see why you don't want to appear too cocky but wearing rings during Finals is so BD for more reasons than ""they just happen to win a lot"". Their cockiness (in a good way) and their swagger as a part of their identity has really grown on me as a fan especially now that I'm not marching."
drumcorps,3dinw6,UdnomyaR,2,Fri Jul 17 02:30:04 2015 UTC,"Is this just for BD or for all corps?  Seems like a cool idea to wear your championship ring on Finals night, regardless of corps."

drumcorps,3dfoyw,xMcNerdx,2,Wed Jul 15 22:21:19 2015 UTC,"This past season I planned on auditioning for two corps and an indoor group on tenors. I ended up dropping on of the corp auditions but still had two auditions on my plate. The first thing you'll need to do is prioritize. One of the auditions will be before the other one, so you'll need to have that one prioritized over the later audition. I also practiced almost everyday, making sure it was as efficient of a practice I could make it. If you're like me, you'll probably start to panic a little a week before the audition because you think you aren't prepared. If this does happen, just keep practicing, I promise you are more prepared than you think.  I ended up getting cut from the corps, but I got section leader for the indoor group, so take from that what you will.  For my corps audition I was asked to prepare a solo, but was never asked to play it. I played some old show music I had memorized Frankensteined with some corps/wgi music I already knew. This saved me a bunch of time, since I didn't have to learn an entirely separate piece or write my own."
drumcorps,3dfoyw,TacticalAlpaca,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:20:04 2015 UTC,"I've heard of people doing it before, but as a heads up, a lot of corps schedule auditions the same weekend, so it might be difficult to audition for two based on schedule alone. More than likely, you'll have to attend a one-day regional clinic/camp to make it work if one of the corps you are auditioning for offers that."
drumcorps,3dfoyw,umasstpt12,-2,Thu Jul 16 23:33:48 2015 UTC,"I played brass, so I'll give you my experience.  I played the Blue Coats audition music for my lyrical piece for a different corps. They don't really care if you use other people's music unless you are supposed to play something specific for them. I used a region piece for my technical piece too.   I owned those pieces, and applied changes that they asked me to do, so they like it and we're pretty impressed.   Blue Coats section leader said I could and should have made their line too."
drumcorps,3dfoyw,InquisitiveLion,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:17:38 2015 UTC,"Hey man. I don't mean to be rude, but brass auditions barely, if at all, translate to percussion auditions. Percussionists are a dime a dozen, and this makes earning a spot ridiculously hard. People have showed with incredible pieces like these and not even gotten callbacks."
drumcorps,3dfoyw,Twavish,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:26:30 2015 UTC,"I know, but I believe the ""prepare some of your own selection of music"" statement could apply to the corps involved. Same thing with the ""play this piece"" means play that piece. If you don't play that piece, you won't make it.   AKA, you can play say... Blue Coat's required piece for a corps that just says ""prepare some music of your own selection""   Also, did they not get it because they didn't attend the camps or they didn't play the required pieces or they got eliminated on technicalities such as camera shots? Or did they march like crap? There are so many factors that go into choosing someone for a corps that a single video of them standing and playing doesn't touch."
drumcorps,3dfoyw,InquisitiveLion,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:29:34 2015 UTC,"The thing is, percussion auditions are almost exclusively warmups/exercises in a group and solos, so your solo is what sets you apart from others, and the warmups aren't solo material. Those were professional recordings of extremely hard solos that when played (very well, mind you) couldn't even net some kids a callback.

The half note that comes before (the high Gb) is a lead-in to the measure, entering on beat 3 of your measure 10. Also, the notes alternate a little differently.

I believe they've worked out the issues. Everything seems to be working just fine at home and on the mobile app.  That being said, you're not missing much this year, too much singing, whatever the heck ""kpop"" is and so much electronics its not drum corps anymore. I suggest watching the old shows instead. Long live G bugles."
drumcorps,3dfwqp,aDysquith,2,Thu Jul 16 05:20:32 2015 UTC,"I agree on the too much singing bit (any singing is too much, but holy shit have a lot of corps included singing this year - I hope that fad dies at the end of the season), and I agree with the kpop sentiment, but disagree that the top shows aren't worth seeing this year. I think they're all pretty hot near the top, and that there is still a whole lot of ""drum corps"" happening in these shows."
drumcorps,3dfwqp,run_like_an_antelope,-1,Thu Jul 16 06:19:19 2015 UTC,"Ok so Crown has a nice face melting show. I'm just struggling continuing to pay money to see something that barely resembles what it claims to be. Say you were a hockey fan since you were 4 years old, and you want to support hockey because it was fun and entertaining your whole life, and then they start strapping rockets to the skates and they allow bigger sticks, make the goal bigger add trampolines…. That’s not quite hockey is it? I just don’t like the direction the activity is heading in, and I hate that the judges are rewarding all the new shenanigans, making more corps likely to sing, use cheap electronics gimmicks, alternative instrumentation etc. I suppose some form of Drum Corps is better than no Drum Corps. /rant"
drumcorps,3dfwqp,aDysquith,2,Thu Jul 16 15:05:54 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I see where you are coming from, but I just can't fully agree on this sentiment. ""Old school drum corps"" is how I fell in love with the activity. I marched my rookie year on a G bugle. I loved it - but can see the shortcomings. Things needed to change for drum corps to survive as a whole.  Here's the thing about art...it evolves over time. Walk in your local art museum - if they're an encyclopedic collection, you will see a large variety of styles in the work. Some patrons don't particularly care for contemporary art. Some don't love baroque works. Everybody is different.   Me? On the classical side I don't care for Vivaldi, but I still respect his work.   My point is, when it gets down to the core of the activity it is still a group of 14-21 year old kids working their butts off to put on a good performance. I don't agree with the direction that some shows are moving in either, but that won't change the fact that it's the same old activity that it's always been.   You don't want a world that doesn't evolve. If that were the case, we'd be driving our Model Ts and mourning the Titanic's sinking. We're not going to have corps that march up and down the yard lines, using the tic system, blaring piston/rotor horns. That's just not what the activity is these days - thankfully.    With that being said, if drum corps ever instituted woodwinds, I'm done  /rant"
drumcorps,3dfwqp,druler,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:06:00 2015 UTC,"Funny, in my initial reply, I was going to write something exactly the same in regards to woodwinds, but decided to leave it out. I can cringe through some singing. While I was against electronics, Bloo has proven that if you use them correctly, they can elevate the activity. Thankfully, no corps have yet marched trombones/french horns. But I simply cannot fathom woodwinds on the field, that would be it for me as well."

We have some of the most well-trained young musicians playing some of the most well-made instruments out there.  I cringe when I hear singing, and even SCV’s/Bloo’s electronics because I want less of that and more of the horns, more of the percussion! More opportunities to be entertained and to want to stand up and cheer and be blown away."
drumcorps,3dfwqp,aDysquith,3,Thu Jul 16 21:05:36 2015 UTC,"I don't understand what people who clearly dislike modern drum corps want. It's not a matter of ""good"" or ""bad"" or ""better"" or ""worse"" when looking at different eras of drum corps/dci. It's entirely a matter of taste.   It's summer marching band by extremely committed kids who pay to participate, and seek to perform at the highest level possible with a group who have similar goals.  I love it across eras, and I pity anybody who can't enjoy modern shows as much as shows from back when they marched or became fans.   I totally respect your right to vent, of course, but a youth activity is one of the weirdest places to see it for me."
drumcorps,3dinzq,Karinta,27,Thu Jul 16 16:08:58 2015 UTC,"You seem angry. I don't think this sub is anti DCA. I think the younger, reddit using generation is more likely to have experience with or interest in DCI. The all age section of the activity certainly has a place, but is not generally seen as the ""Major league"" as DCI commonly advertises itself to be."
drumcorps,3dinzq,Puppyisbox5,12,Thu Jul 16 16:19:41 2015 UTC,"I think a large part of /u/Karinta 's feelings are because if any of us on this board are thought to be or suspected to be of the earlier generations of drum corps, anything we post is downvoted heavily if it's even remotely critical of today's activity. There seems to be little tolerance of differing opinion, even if that opinion is well thought out and presented and not just something like ""electronics suck, they need to be banned"".   Reddit's downvote button isn't supposed to be a ""disagree"" button. It's supposed to be used when a comment or content is inappropriate or adds nothing to the discussion.   Instead of blindly downvoting something, it would be nice for people to actually reply to a comment they disagree with, using an argument that supports their opinion. That's how we learn more about each other's ideas and opinions. And it could teach all of us that no matter what age we are, or what school of drum corps we may think is ideal, we could all actually learn something from each other."
drumcorps,3dinzq,junderdawg,8,Thu Jul 16 17:00:28 2015 UTC,"I think people mostly downvote because they're getting sick of hearing people complain. I'm not saying that's always a good reason to downvote, but I don't think it's just out of disagreement. The problem is, a lot of alumni from the 70s, 80s and 90s really dislike the new changes in DCI regarding what is and isn't allowed on the field. I don't have any problem with people not liking the new things, but I think it sometimes gets to a level of just complaining rather than discussing. I also think some alumni have thick nostalgia goggles on and refuse to accept that the activity is changing, which can also get really old. I just wish people would quit being so negative all the time. Not just here, but the internet, and the world, as a whole."
drumcorps,3dinzq,ChokeZero,4,Thu Jul 16 17:46:30 2015 UTC,"You're right. That's neither a good nor legitimate reason to downvote.  I agree with a lot of what you say here. I get pretty tired of comments that say nothing more than ""this sucks"" or ""that needs to be banned"".   And you're right. The activity is changing. Don't be too hard on all of us alumni, though. If you really look at a lot of the legitimate criticism, it comes from what is seen as the changing of a unique art form into something that isn't as unique as it once was. Today's DCI is still an entertaining art form, but it has become perhaps too similar to marching band. That's where a lot of the concern and angst comes from. It has gone from something that primarily high school age people with a few college age people thrown in did as a way to expand their talents and horizons, i.e., learning an entirely different instrument, technique or skill (like color guard) that a band program just didn't offer, and has become an activity that is seemingly dominated by college music majors playing the same instruments, techniques and skills that they are learning in college. It is the loss of that uniqueness and the challenges it presented - that experience - that the vast majority of us mourn the loss of."
drumcorps,3dinzq,junderdawg,4,Thu Jul 16 18:20:20 2015 UTC,"I hear this complaint a lot, and I really just don't understand why it's suddenly not unique. Was DCI/DCA ever really that different from marching band? I get the drill and music is generally harder with drum corps shows, and they're usually of a much higher quality, and obviously the instrument types, but other than that, has there ever been such a huge difference between competitive marching band and drum corps?"
drumcorps,3dinzq,ChokeZero,2,Thu Jul 16 18:37:40 2015 UTC,"Yes, there used to be a HUGE difference between drum corps and marching band. The marching styles were completely different. Color guards were either not a part of marching bands or were very small and did not use similar equipment or skills - mostly flashy drum majors and baton twirlers. The drum lines utilized completely different skill sets and methods. And the biggest difference was in the horn sections. Leaving wood winds aside, brass instruments were completely different. Marching bands used instruments with 3 valves keyed in both Bb and F (trumpets, baritones, tubas, mellophones and french horns) while drum corps used bugles (soprano, baritone, mellophone, alto, contra bass) with one or two valves (one piston and one rotor, later two piston valves, and later still three valves) keyed in G. In my own case, I played french horn and mellophone in high school - keyed in F, and had to learn to play a bugle with two valves - keyed in G. Totally different instrument.   The lines began to blur when marching bands decided to start marching ""corps style"". The marching styles changed to mimic drum corps. Drum lines began playing using drum corps techniques. Color guards were added and expanded or evolved into corps style color guards. DCI was the standard that marching bands began to try to follow.   But marching bands, being mostly a product of public schools, also used instruments that weren't considered to be ""natural"" marching instruments - electric bass and electric guitar led the way. Not long after, they decided that it was easier to include the kids who took piano lessons as synth players than to exclude them for whatever reason. And for whatever reason, DCI followed suit - switching to traditional marching band brass, keyed in Bb or F with three valves, legalizing electronics, allowing percussion sections to add stationary pits with synths. DCI became the follower and not the leader."
drumcorps,3dinzq,junderdawg,3,Thu Jul 16 19:13:21 2015 UTC,"I feel that this more just proves my point. They both follow each other on different things, building on things lime what intruments and styles they use, for better or for worse."
drumcorps,3dinzq,ChokeZero,2,Thu Jul 16 19:31:04 2015 UTC,"I disagree entirely, but it is because I feel that drum corps should be an entirely different experience for the participants just like (dare I say it?) back in the day. ;)"
drumcorps,3dinzq,junderdawg,2,Thu Jul 16 20:28:22 2015 UTC,"I really dont understand how its supposed to go back to being so original. Should  DCI suddenly return to high knee, G bugles?  I mean, if originality is the issue, its a shame high school marching  band took so many components, but whats DCI to do to stand  out again?  Edit: Just wanted to clarify, I'm not being sarcastic or anything. I genuinely want to know what you (or others) think DCI should do to be more  unique."
drumcorps,3dinzq,Gooberplease,2,Fri Jul 17 03:46:06 2015 UTC,"That's an interesting question. First, please don't take my saying that I feel something unique is gone means that it can come back. I'm afraid that ship sailed a long time ago. But I do think that there are some changes that can be made to DCI that would help make things easier for the corps to remain financially viable and insure the stability of drum corps as a marching music activity that remains true to its roots. To me, that's what's really important - that drum corps is there first and foremost for generations to come to have and enjoy, and second, for the activity to remain true to its roots and not morph into something completely unrecognizable as drum corps. The activity has become so expensive for both the corps and the people marching, it's almost like an arms race."
drumcorps,3dinzq,junderdawg,2,Fri Jul 17 13:51:25 2015 UTC,"And how are you to judge that? Most modern people today will still tell you the experience is completely different from their high school. Saying the experience is the same as marching band is so ignorant just because the same equipment is used or because we inherited some ideas from them. Oh man high school football and the nfl are all the same, they use pads and a football. As for taking stuff from marching bands, if its a good idea adapt, people have moments of brilliance all the time, are you going to shoot it down cause you feel as if youre superior for whatever reason? A smart person would listen and broaden their experience. An ignorant person would neglect that resource and fall short of the person that listened to the brilliant idea."
drumcorps,3dinzq,Spontaneity8,0,Thu Jul 16 21:05:26 2015 UTC,Nowhere did I say that the drum corps experience is the same as marching band. I did say that drum corps has become perhaps too similar to marching band. Big difference.   And thanks for the ad hominem attacks.

Why not start a thread or two on DCA? I am admittedly out of the loop, so I would enjoy a primer on what I need to know about all-age corps. Honestly, when I first learned about drum corps I didn't even know DCA existed until camp season of my rookie year.   There's been a weird break in the subreddit lately between G/Bb. I've poked fun at it, but I'm not really sure what's going on.

Take for example, /r/hockey features mostly NHL related news and discussion with other leagues such as the KHL and AHL on the back burner.

drumcorps,3dinzq,ChokeZero,7,Thu Jul 16 16:40:18 2015 UTC,"There does seem to be, shall we say, a lack of appreciation for those who came before and the foundation that they laid (at least in this subreddit), upon which today's drum corps were built.   However, I also think that we ""old guys"" (and gals) tend to forget that reddit definitely skews younger and that today's younger generation has little tolerance for ""back in the day"" stories and experiences that go back further than 10-15 years. Any further and it's just too far removed from what they know and do to be of any interest to them as more than ancient history.   I marched back in the '70's in a DCI finalist corps when there were literally hundreds of drum corps across the country and there were a lot of damn good corps that didn't get on board the DCI train. They still clung to their VFW and American Legion roots, and the perception of those corps became that they weren't as good as DCI corps. This perception, along with the emergence of DCI as THE sanctioning body, led to kids losing interest in marching in a corps that didn't set its sights on being competitive in DCI. Over the years - rightly or wrongly - DCI came to be viewed as either the only legitimate sanctioning body for the activity, or at least the only one with any credibility.   I saw something on Facebook yesterday that made me chuckle. It was a link to the TV show ""The Doctors"" website, and they had done a story about how with the concern for injuries in sports, Drum Corps is now America's fastest growing youth activity. Hopefully, if this is true, it will lead to a resurgence in the number of active corps and might lead to some new sanctioning bodies that will generate interest in corps outside the scope of DCI."
drumcorps,3dinzq,junderdawg,7,Thu Jul 16 16:44:08 2015 UTC,"I guess I'm just weird because I'm 17 and I like both ancient history and drum corps stories from back in the day. I'd encourage more threads and comments about ye olden days. The only thing I don't like is the old, tired crap about how DCI sucks these days and electronics, Bb trumpets, trombones, horns and concert euphs are bad. I don't mind people sharing their opinions, but constant complaints about how things suck now get really old."
drumcorps,3dinzq,ChokeZero,3,Thu Jul 16 17:39:56 2015 UTC,"I agree with much of what you say. However, a lot of the ""old guys"" get just as tired of the comments about how great things like electronics are, period, without taking a critical look at them. For instance, what adds to the skill level or satisfaction of accomplishing something musically on the field when a synthesizer is used primarily for providing the bass sound on the field that a tuba section isn't providing?  Or using electronics to artificially increase the overall volume of a corps horn line, because the horn line is incapable of providing the needed volume?  Or using a synth to play pre-recorded horn line tracks because the performers on the field just can't handle playing the music and marching at the same time?  I have no problem with using electronics to provide sounds or effects that wouldn't otherwise be a part of a show. In fact, they can really add a lot. But to use them as a crutch to camouflage shortcomings, to me, adds nothing to the art form. These are, I think, legitimate points for discussion, but 9 times out of 10 when they are brought up in this sub, the response isn't to engage in a discussion about it. The reaction is to downvote heavily and post comments like ""shut up old guy"", ""just accept that things change"", ""the old days sucked and you can't just accept that you weren't as talented""."
drumcorps,3dinzq,junderdawg,2,Thu Jul 16 18:34:26 2015 UTC,"The only time I see people mention electronics it's just to complain about them. I completely agree that electronics are abused when a corps uses a bass note on a synthesizer to help broaden a sound, but love it when they're used for special effects, like in Tilt."
drumcorps,3dinzq,thiscorpsofbrothers,3,Thu Jul 16 19:33:52 2015 UTC,"And that's the fault of the person posting the comment that just says ""that sucks. Change it!"".    The only time I see people mention electronics it's just to complain about them. I completely agree that electronics are abused when a corps uses a bass note on a synthesizer to help broaden a sound, but love it when they're used for special effects, like in Tilt.   See, this proves that we share common ground on some things. A more informed and civil discussion, such as the one we've had today, can be a positive thing. Suppose, just for a moment, that through discussions such as these it turned out that the opinion you have expressed here was, in fact, a majority opinion (not saying it is, just suppose so for the sake of discussion). If fans, corps alumni and even current marching members were in agreement and went to DCI to propose a rules change . . .  As it is, the discussion about these issues is nothing more than ""yes it is"" - ""no it isn't"" and does nothing to improve the experience for either the fans or the performers."

drumcorps,3dinzq,junderdawg,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:22:24 2015 UTC,"Don't think there is a lack of appreciation for those who came before. History and tradition are a strong component for all drum corps. This just is the natural order of things. Drum corps is an art and what is modern is going to spawn the most discussion. Art doesn't move forward by staying stuck in the past. I'm not saying the past is any lesser or below what is done today. Its just different. The shows of the past are what inspired the shows following them, and it continued to evolve to what it is today. I understand that people don't like change, and neither do I. I grew up with these new shows, and while older shows are something I appreciate, I just don't connect with them the way you do. Times change things. The competitiveness of the activity is something that drew me (and probably a significant amount of people) into the activity, so that's probably why it has become prevalent.   Edit: I also think ""hatred"" is a strong word. Drum Corps is a family, no matter where or when you marched, you are a part of that. I feel like the newer generation is being constantly criticized for not being whatever the past was. Its not our fault, the design of shows just evolved like any other art form does. There is so much cynicism in an activity about becoming the best you can be with 149 of your best friends on tour."
drumcorps,3dinzq,ROBLOXBayat,2,Thu Jul 16 17:05:32 2015 UTC,"I don't necessarily think that people actually in the activity have the perceived lack of appreciation that the young people outside - the current ""fans"" do.    I feel like the newer generation is being constantly criticized for not being whatever the past was. Its not our fault, the design of shows just evolved like any other art form does.   This is an outstanding observation, and something that needs to be addressed. When we ""old guys"" start complaining about something in today's activity, our criticism is NOT being directed at the kids on-field. Today's kids are very talented and work their butts off. And they put on outstanding shows utilizing the rules and equipment available to them to their fullest extent. The ""old guys"" often need to make this sentiment known better.   On the other hand, our beef is with some of those rules and allowable equipment. We know that those decisions are not in the hands of today's performers, and today's performers need to realize that the old guys know that, and quit taking it as criticism of the performers when the old guys criticize the current rules and instrumentation and those that make the rules."

drumcorps,3dinzq,junderdawg,6,Thu Jul 16 17:57:55 2015 UTC,"Because your baseless, self-pandering bogus complaining about how ""no one"" respects the activity as it was decades ago is the same generalizing broad brush-painting that you're hypocritically bitching about. People are more engaged in what's happening right now because - get this - it's actually happening right now. People can actively go see the shows that they're talking about and feel like a part of the experience. And as far as people in the community having a higher propensity to discuss the top ensembles of DCI, maybe that has to do with the fact that they're putting out the most interesting, exciting and demanding products.   The way to get people to respect your generation isn't to piss and moan about how the activity is now, or to boast about how much more substantial of an experience drum corps was back in your day. I see it all the time. That's alienating and, honestly, extremely obtuse behavior. No one is going to respect you because you simply tell them they should, or that you're entitled to their respect.

But the bottom line is, you should respect the current members for carrying on the traditions your generation laid down and continuing to push the activity just as much as they should you, and lambasting and reprimanding a subreddit full of current members and prospective auditionees is not the way to do that.

It's not just DCA and International corps, it's smaller corps like Les Stentors, Coastal Surge, etc. that get little to no recognition by DCI. But, if the Blue Devils fart on the field, you can bet the DCI Twitter account has retweeted that fart and has a vine video of it somewhere. People don't know to look for it if they don't know it exists in the first place, and a lot of this forum is people new to the activity within the last few years. Therefore, I'll do my part to expand the knowledge on here. Everyone should spend time today to learn the history of Jubal from the Netherlands. They've been active for over 100 years. At one point in their history, they (against their will) became the official drum corps of the Nazi party and had swastikas on their uniforms. Their history is some of the coolest stuff you'll read today. I promise."

For Spirit, they picked a pretty good design with ""Magnolia"", but they were super dirty and picked/arranged the songs that didn't really fit on the field very well.   Pioneer keeps with the Irish theme, but just can't clean above a certain point. There's not a ton of Irish music out there that works on the field, but arrangements can fix that.  When you look at what happens on the field from the Top 12, and then look at he source material, you'll see how much of their achievement is due to good design."

Mine fits with a 1600x900 screen.  I can reorganize the legend I suppose. I just was lazy and let python print it however it wanted. Should be organized in the same order as the columns by tonight.

drumcorps,3d9stc,iotone,10,Tue Jul 14 20:33:30 2015 UTC,Seriously. Unless you're high up in a major stadium or dome there's no way the judges or audience can see the forms.

drumcorps,3d9stc,LikeAThousandBullets,2,Wed Jul 15 01:03:35 2015 UTC,"I believe the judges are at the back of the 400's level. You can see pretty much everything from the 300's level and up, and still a great deal from the back of the 200's level. I think people here are overestimating how high you have to sit in order to see the forms; unless the seats are separated by a track (or are unreasonably far away) AND the slope is shallow (* cough * Manchester, NH), you will usually be able to see nearly everything from the box.  I also notice that during ensemble, staff often like to set up their tower thingy a ways away from the field, so they can get a more realistic view of what the show looks like."
drumcorps,3d9stc,princekamoro,3,Wed Jul 15 07:15:08 2015 UTC,Well corps clean from the angle the judges see from though so that's also why this drone perspective doesn't look perfectly clean.

The audition process for every horn is extremely similar and just because the mellos get some of the ""spotlight"" licks doesn't necessarily mean it'll be any easier or harder to land a spot on that versus trumpets or baritones. Auditions usually consist of playing something from the technique packet and a couple solo etudes, and those are hard no matter what you play. I'm a self-taught mellophone player who majors in saxophone in college and I'm thrilled with my choice. In fact, and I might get some flak for saying this, mellophone is a fine middle ground because it's lighter than a baritone which could be better for your back and has a similar feel playing-wise to trumpet, but it's transposed down a fourth so the range isn't as strenuous (I sometimes refer to mello as ""trumpet easy mode"" even though it's a completely different instrument). Plus, going through a season MAKES you good enough to play those licks. Give it some thought, mellophone is sick."

drumcorps,3dbu27,flyoddd,3,Wed Jul 15 10:47:36 2015 UTC,Hi! I often answer these posts in similar ways. All top 12 corps spots are very competitive. Many of the elite drum corps only take people who have strong mastery of a specific instrument. You were worried about parts but that shouldn't be your priority. Instead try playing each instrument a little and see what you prefer. Also if you are looking to start your DCI career and need training you should consider open class. There are mostly teaching corps and almost all open class member end up either staying with their corps or moving to a bigger corps.   The difference between bari and euph is size and range. The bari tends to play higher first and second parts and the euph is usually third baritone.  The easiest to learn depends a lot on your face and lip size but generally bari is easier to play but much harder to march especially compared to a trumpet.   I hope this helps and if you need any help at all don't hesitate to ask. I was a DCI performer and am now a teacher at an open class corps. Good luck in your preparation!
drumcorps,3dbu27,flyoddd,2,Wed Jul 15 02:07:35 2015 UTC,"I'm not too sure how to word this, but are most open class corps easy to get into? Easy isn't the right word, but is it a nice transition for a woodwinds player like me? Will it be hard to land a spot?  I'm a lot better player than I am marcher. I can do both pretty well with a saxophone, but playing is a lot easier. Would I be better off going with trumpet (or now I'm considering mellophone)?   How heavy are bari/euphs? I ruled out contras for their weight and the fact that they rest on your shoulder because of my back issues, but holding an insanely heavy instrument wouldn't be much of a help either.   Thanks for your help! I hope you don't mind if I PM you sometime down the road with any random questions I have :)  EDIT: My school district ends school (usually) in the third week of June (normally sometime between the 12th and 18th). I know some corps let high school students come to spring training after school ends, but those are only for kids who end early June. What are most open class corps policies with school and the start of the summer?"
drumcorps,3dbu27,flyoddd,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:44:37 2015 UTC,Depending on the corps as long as you pay your fees and you show improvement you will be offered a spot. The open class corps I work with we actually audition people on woodwind instruments and then recommend the brass instrument that will be best for them. The baritone is about 5 pounds and is supported with mainly your upper back and arms. An euph can be double.
drumcorps,3dbu27,flyoddd,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:48:35 2015 UTC,"Do most open class corps have woodwind players audition on their primary instrument, or is that just a thing you guys do?"
drumcorps,3dbu27,Spontaneity8,2,Wed Jul 15 03:59:15 2015 UTC,I am not completely sure what other corps do but I'd assume no. We are about 70% woodwind converts so in November we don't want you to panic trying to audition on an instrument that does not showcase your musicality. So we decided to let people audition on their primary the first camp then play for us again the next camp on a brass instrument. It gives the members a month or two to learn the basics of brass playing.
drumcorps,3dbu27,flyoddd,2,Wed Jul 15 04:03:25 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry for asking you so many questions, but do you know if people  generally try out for more than one corps? With where I live, I can only reach about four corps for their camps (and three of them are about six-hour drives). Let's say I wanted to audition for two corps, and one let's me play on my primary while the other doesn't. Should I even bother auditioning on my regular instrument if I need to make a decision for the other camp. Also, I know that some audition camp dates overlap. If people do audition for multiple corps, how do they work around overlapping camps?"
drumcorps,3dbu27,Ikanda234,2,Wed Jul 15 04:31:43 2015 UTC,You have to decide what corps you would want to audition for the most and make their camps a priority. Many corps have an experience camp in November. Try going to your choice corps November camp and if you get a call back go back in December. If you don't they may recommend another corps or you can contact another corps thst you are interested in attending their December camp. Open Class corps understand their place in the activity and will often put their camp a week later than the world class corps around them so that people that aren't ready for world can still audition. Also don't worry about asking too many questions they are good questions.
drumcorps,3dbu27,flyoddd,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:38:30 2015 UTC,"The problem I have is that the two corps that I'm interested in have overlapping dates. One is a lot closer (just an hour drive), but the other is a lot farther (six hours) and I think I'm a bigger fan of what they do. I just don't know whether or not it's worth the money to get to the latter's camps.  Another random quesiton: do you get a general idea as to whether or not you'll land a spot by December?"
drumcorps,3dbu27,_bagelthief,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:56:55 2015 UTC,"I'd say spend the extra time and try out for the one you really like. Many corps give you some kind of ranking systems, for example the cadets rank you with a 1-3 in marching and playing. 1 means you get an offer, 2 is a call back and 3 is a suggestion you may not be ready."

drumcorps,3dbu27,backgrinder,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:44:04 2015 UTC,What I look for in a member when auditioning people is someone who obviously knows how to play but also (and more importantly)  someone who is willing to try new things and improve. We require a scale plus two etudes that are high school level for all brass auditionees. You should have no trouble getting a contract as long as you have the right attitude!

I know that everyone in this activity works just as hard as the next, but I don't know if I can be away for that long competing with an open class corps. It's nothing against them, but I just don't find it worthwhile. I won't age out until 2021, so it's not like I need the experience (although it'd be nice, I just don't see the point). Do you think I'd be fine waiting a few years, improving my skills on mellophone, and then auditioning for a world class corps?   Hope that made sense."
drumcorps,3dbu27,Prisoner__24601,3,Wed Jul 15 03:50:50 2015 UTC,"Open Class has this stigma of being a worse or less competitve version of world class. It is quite the opposite. Open Class drum corps are actually quite competitive. Many do well even against their world class counterparts. Last season competitively, open class had 5 corps beat out world class corps for spots at semi finals. The highest last season, BDB placed 15th at semis meaning it beat over half of the world class corps. The only difference between many open and world class corps is age of the corps and member age. Many of the O.C. corps are young and beginning to establish themselves in the marching arts world. Also a lot of young musicians will join an open class corps because they are financially cheaper, and the tours tend to be less extreme making it a great option for first year DCI members or people who can't commit to a huge almost 3 moth straight tour. The teaching you get in open class will be similar to World. Many corps hire educators that have similar experience to the world class corps and often world class (or the other way) techs will switch to open because of finances or just location to where they live. I hope this was helpful any other questions don't hesitate to ask  TL/DR Open Class is equal to World in most ways and is a perfect place for first year DCI musicians."

She was super understanding, and all I had to do was take 2 finals before school started the Friday morning of move-ins and then left. I'm sure it varies from school to school, but it was fairly simple and they were really chill about it. Some friends of mine didn't even have to take a final or two, their teacher just excused them from it, but I'm sure it just depends on the teacher."

I don't want to do anything that could potentially compromise my grades."
drumcorps,3dc1mc,GbogD,3,Wed Jul 15 03:20:38 2015 UTC,"Honestly, to do drum corps means to sacrifice. How much do you want it? People do it every year willing to work their asses off on the off-season, just to get the spot.   That said, your corps should work with you on a move-in date so you can balance getting more study time, but still not moving in too late. Also, communicate with your teachers. You can do it!"

drumcorps,3dc1mc,jam8240,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:45:05 2015 UTC,"I moved in on time when I marched, but I did see others show up late/take a marching spot later in the season. Basically what I noticed from drum corps is you'll watch your spot for a short amount of time, taking into account step size and all that good stuff, and then you hop in and take it a few sets at a time. You'll probably need to take some time at the beginning of meal breaks going through your sets when there's no one on the field, as well as spending a good amount of time tracking dots in your dot book. This was what I observed so I may be wrong, and pace may vary for different corps.  I showed up to high school band a week and a half late and it was super laxed and easy to follow (cause drill/music is way easier)"
drumcorps,3dc1mc,jam8240,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:11:46 2015 UTC,"Echoing the other reply to your comment, but 90% of it is learning drill. By day 10, the corps will have learned about 2/3 of the show drill wise, and maybe some body. You would likely have at least some of the drill before move-ins start, so it would be expected that your dot book would be up to date by then. You would also have most, if not all, of the show music by then, so it would be expected that it would be memorized.   I've never moved in late, but from talking to people who did, the consensus is about the same- the first 4-5 days suck while you try to catch up with the rest of the corps and get into the drill as fast as possible, but you'll be mostly caught up after 7-8 days, definitely before the end of move ins."
drumcorps,3dc1mc,cardboardwindow2,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:58:09 2015 UTC,"Open class corps have less of a ""move in"" period.

In the past there was a much more fraternity feeling to being in corps where members would join at a younger age and age out in one corps. Now it is not uncommon for members, like you said, to move up to more competitively successful corps. Some members will switch, even to similarly competitive corps to stay with staff they want to work with or just because they think they might have a better experience at a different corps. I see people that frown on this a lot . But when you are paying thousands to march, you should be marching where you feel most comfortable.   TL/DR Yes it happens. Not often but it does."

drumcorps,3dak0f,lonestarpercussion,2,Tue Jul 14 20:47:47 2015 UTC,"A lot of your questions are dependent on the particular corps you're trying to join.  Generally, Open Class corps are less competitive when it comes to open positions and level of talent, though it could be argued that some of the best Open Class corps are on par or better than the lower World Class Corps.  The music will be harder than anything you've played in high school, both musically and technically. If you have a hard time learning or playing your high school's marching band show, you're probably not ready to audition for a corps.  Being in the pit is less physically demanding than a marching position, but you will need enough strength to lift heavy instruments in and out of trucks. You'll need to be able to push a marimba up a hill by yourself.  Costs vary per corps. I aged out quite a while ago and I don't have accurate numbers, but you could probably be expected to pay $2500 - $4000 in tour fees with a World Class group. This does not include the camp fees or travel expenses.  The World Class season really begins in November, where you will be expected to attend one weekend-long camp a month. The summer tour begins in late May (high school students are not expected to be on tour until their school year is over) with a few weeks of intensive learning of the show, usually in one location. The real 'touring' begins in early June and commences in mid-August.  Hopefully somebody can chime in about Open Class costs and season length."

drumcorps,3dak0f,Zashiony,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:49:43 2015 UTC,I'm curious because I might audition for a corps soon. Do all corps not expect high school students to not come on tour until the school year is over? I finish school (usually) late June. That's a lot of time that the rest of the corps is spending cleaning and learning the show.
drumcorps,3dak0f,Wheat_Thins_R_Logica,2,Tue Jul 14 21:10:28 2015 UTC,"It's normal for high school students to join a corps immediately after their school year has ended, but that is traditionally in early June.  Late June may be too late for a corps to agree to give you a spot. At that point it's probably dependent on whether the corps thinks you have the ability to get caught up in time."
drumcorps,3dak0f,lonestarpercussion,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:38:30 2015 UTC,Do you think the 3rd week of June is considered late or early? School has ended for me sometime betweeen June 12th and 18th for me these past few years.

I've had to do it a lot and I can do it more... I am a girl so I think if I want to do it quicker I may need to train since I'm usually less physically adaptable than the guys.  Oh gosh...

drumcorps,3dak0f,malcolmsanger,2,Tue Jul 14 21:12:56 2015 UTC,"A drum corps show is around 12 minutes in length (don't think about it in terms of pages). Your marching band show is probably 6 or 7 minutes long in comparison.  During the first intensive weeks of ""all-days"" or ""move-ins"" you'll probably be put through the same physical regimen as the rest of the corps, which is mostly about cardiovascular health. Once you actually get on the road that will change.  Here's the typical world-class season:   November Camp (one weekend) December Camp (one weekend) January Camp (one weekend) February Camp (one weekend) March Camp (one weekend) April Camp (one weekend) Late May (Early June for HS kids) to Mid August: Tour   Start over again in November."

drumcorps,3d7np1,pokefan213,7,Tue Jul 14 04:55:05 2015 UTC,"Was at this show, and there were a few things I noticed about each corps. I'm not a percussion person, so I don't look for analyzing that.  Cavies: Visuals are coming together nicely since the last time I had seen. Effective use of props is more apparent. Brass could use some cleaning up still, but will come around. Run Boy Run is still (imo) annoying to listen to, just because of the singing. That doesn't reflect in the scores, though, and is working for them, it seems.  Regiment: I'm biased here because they're my favorite corps, but their show was very entertaining. Visually, it could use some cleaning. A lot of cleaning. Stop the bouncing aroubd on the field. Brass was Phantom Regiment through and through, and the closer was amazing.  BD: Overall, a very visually appealing and musically challenging show. They're doing a fantastic job of maintaining cleanliness. Brass was exceptional, and percussion was clean and tight.  Bloo: PA system seemed a bit whacky, but maybe that was on purpose? Took away from its rhythmic contribution, but the corps was nonetheless gorgeous. Props are entertaining, and the visuals were fantastic. Brass was Bluecoats powerhouse. It didn't attract me like Tilt did, though.  Cadets: Meh. Have you noticed there's no 7 on the guard blinds? Brass was gorgeous, and the F horn feature had visuals that basically said ""We're doing this, deal with it."" Visually appealing, just watch the intervals. The wave feature catches me every time.  Crown: Hot. The banner drew me in right off the bat, and the musical selection was brilliant. Crown cleanliness. Visuals were fantastic. Clean up intervals.  SCV: Nice musical selection. ""Pure Imagination"" made a fantastic ballad. Visually appealing, but the props just seemed too ""fake"" to work for me. Brass was great, and the guard was wonderful.   Overall, the scores tonight were what I expected. The tie was surprising, but I see SCV overtaking Crown again."
drumcorps,3d7np1,superOOk,5,Tue Jul 14 05:30:56 2015 UTC,"Bloo had a bad run tonight...but new ending going in this week, and then a TON of cleaning in the last 3 weeks. We all know what happened last year :) Bloo was (waait for it)...2.5 points behind Cadets at this point last year. And this show was MADE for the dome."
drumcorps,3d7np1,schmitz97,2,Tue Jul 14 06:30:04 2015 UTC,Do you know if they'll have the new ending ready for San Antonio? I've been waiting for them to change it and I'm really hoping I'll get to see it live!

drumcorps,3d7np1,Zashiony,3,Tue Jul 14 06:03:16 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing that for finals, BD and the Cadets will be fighting for 1st and 2nd, Bloo will land 3rd, and Crown and SCV will be 4th/5th. We still have a little less than a month between now and finals, so anything can happen! Everyone is so close right now, so its nearly impossible to tell.  The Cadets' new closer is really paying off. They are moving like hell out there and it's working out nicely. I haven't seen it live, but from what video I've seen they're still managing to produce a good sound.   EDIT: After looking at the full recap, it looks like that the Cadets' hauling ass in their new closer might be affecting their hornline's music scores. This could have just been a bad run, however, as their scores don't look like they've suffered here before. I bet it has something to do with nerves and competing against the entire G7 for the first time this season. It was nearly straight ones for them aside from this and their color guard. I can't really tell a good color guard from a bad one, so I have no idea what happened there. They seem to be consistently be placing lower here as well. Whatever the problem may be, I'm sure they'll have it cleaned up in no time."
drumcorps,3d7np1,umasstpt12,9,Tue Jul 14 03:53:17 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that for most of last year, it seemed BD and Cadets were going to finish 1-2 before Bluecoats came in last minute and stole second on finals night. 3.5 weeks left, anything can happen."
drumcorps,3d7np1,Zashiony,2,Tue Jul 14 04:32:27 2015 UTC,"Anything can happen, but I don't think Kinetic Noise will not have the same effect as Tilt where it will come in with the upset at finals. I think a more accurate prediction would have been Crown and Bloo figuring for 3rd/4th."
drumcorps,3d7np1,DJWintoFresh,2,Tue Jul 14 13:16:35 2015 UTC,I was listening on a really good sound system tonight and I heard some poor quality as they were hauling balls. Here's hoping they can get that under control.
drumcorps,3d7np1,Zashiony,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:06:00 2015 UTC,"Their staff definitely knows that the closer needs work. With how fast they're moving and how new the closer is, it's bound to be a bit dirty."
drumcorps,3d7np1,ports84,2,Tue Jul 14 13:22:14 2015 UTC,"Agreed. They just put the closer on the field and are still not in good enough shape physically to perform it at a championship level. The year I marched, we were behind for most of the season and the first time we beat Cavies was a week before finals. This was mainly because the show was incredibly difficult and it took most of the summer to physically be able to perform it well. Check out this recap from July 23, 2005. A few weeks later we were ahead by 2 points and broke 99."
drumcorps,3d7np1,moppr,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:17:20 2015 UTC,I kind of feel like Crown will take 3rd over Bloo. Agree on the other stuff. Really weird though to see Cadets' color guard placing so low compared to them being either #1 or #2 in ever other category.
drumcorps,3d7np1,savedsid,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:11:19 2015 UTC,I feel like CG scores have been flippy floppy this year. I've noticed Crown's guard doing well so far but they placed 3rd tonight.

I just saw them at the DeKalb show, and while the writing is killer, their achievement of that writing was not, mostly on beginning and ends of phrases, which will undoubtedly clean up in due time. The cadets definitely deserve every 1st place percussion caption they can get, they are on fire this year. Not many of the drum corps drumlines make me smile and laugh in giddy happiness anymore, but the cadets surely accomplished that this previous weekend. Bluecoats also seem to be quite clean so early, and of course SCV. I mean... it IS a Paul Rennick line. But, I'll probably eat everything I just said when BD has more time with their beats, hones it in, and dominates. So, fuck me."

drumcorps,3d653g,druler,5,Tue Jul 14 01:02:37 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of you guys are missing what he is really saying.  He isn't puting down the work or effort of modern marchers (hell, most of them are lightyears ahead of where we were), he is pointing out the stark differences between his experience and the modern one.  He is doing it in a somewhat combative way, but there is a valid point there.    Yes, the activity has been through a lot of obvious changes in terms of the technical and performance aspects that fans see.  What he is talking about in the OP is swagger.  Corps used to have it, staff encouraged it, and fans loved it.  It was part of what set you apart from the primitive high schools that most members came from.  We used different words, different commands, and took pride in not being band.  The differences were massive back then.  More important, are the massive changes in the member experience.  You didn't have a cell phone, air matresses were still pretty new even when I marched, and (before my time) they knew a lot less about sports medicine.  You were forced to interact with the people around you, and the shared experience pushed you closer.  There were no phones, handheld game systems, surfaces, etc.  There was no real window to the rest of the world, save a copy of Drum Corps World that one person bought and then handed around the bus.  You ate, breatheded, and lived drum corps with your corpsmates and staff 24/7 for months.  It would be an almost unrecognizable experience for most modern members.  Neither era was better or worse, but it was certainly different.  That's the real takeaway.  Any vet that talks down on modern members is using some seriously rose colored glasses, but modern members should try and understand where the older vets are coming from too.  Corps is about a lot more than a 10.5-12 minute show, everyone knows that."

I actually started out auditioning for Crown but she convinced me to audition at Cadets with her. We had been dating for about 5 months before we left for the summer. We lasted through the summer but we eventually broke up a year and a half later for unrelated reasons.  My second year I had a few hook-ups but nothing serious.  I know a few people that started relationships while on tour and they are still together years later. One is even married and had their first child.
drumcorps,3d7skk,irishknots,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:24:53 2015 UTC,"My age out, I was dating a girl in my corps. We lived ~1000 miles apart in the offseason. She is now my wife. It works out - drum corps is not the determining factor, your maturity, dedication, and view on the relationship are.   I also just saw two good friends who aged out with me and started dating on tour get engaged a few weeks ago. They also were long distance for a while.   That being said: being single on tour is a unique experience. And yes Tour goggles are real. Everyone gets skinny tan and muscled - combine that with hormones and it becomes a real state of mind.   It really depends on the people involved in the tour relationship. Some are just a fling for a night to release, some are more legitimate that can't survive past tour, and some make it out into the real world and become solidified. The only thing I really have to say is be honest in any of these situations, it truly helps.   TL;DR - Yes, real relationship. Married my seat partner."

Anyway, I did make an agreement w/ Mr. Mason to meet back up w/ the corps when they came through my home state a couple weeks later to help out on the way to MS, which leads to my heat story: ~130 in Natchitoches, LA the week before finals in Jackson. Here's some footage. It was on that hard old astroturf so it magnified the heat. I went to college at that same school (was about to be a freshman) and can't recall it ever getting that hot over the next 5 years or so. I had band camp just outside that stadium on blacktop the week after Finals and it wasn't nearly as hot despite the worse surface. Also, I wasn't there when this happened, but in Jackson, it was so hot at the rehearsal spot that a dried up tree literally broke and came up out of the ground during rehearsal. Generally agreed by everyone to be the worst Finals location ever."

drumcorps,3d5k5g,spicycornchip,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:37:57 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Above the turf is going to be higher than the raw temperature because of the incredible radiant heat. If it's 100 degrees out, the turf is probably at 140 or above in the sun.   Raw temperatures are measured in the shade, without regard to sunlight or humidity."
drumcorps,3d5k5g,ports84,4,Wed Jul 15 06:53:39 2015 UTC,"A couple stand out to me:   We stayed at Texas State before the San Antonio regional. It was so hot that we bumped rehearsal up to 7 am, and then took a few hours off in the middle of the day as ""siesta time"". I remember being drenched in sweat as soon as I walked outside at 6:30 in the morning. By that point of tour I was pretty much acclimated to the heat, so I didn't think it was a big deal. I was wrong.   We were a couple of hours into rehearsal and I realized that my head was warmer than it has ever felt before. It felt like I was significantly slower, and couldn't help myself from hysterically laughing at every comment from the box. I think I was slowly losing my mind.   Other day was on our show day at Western Michigan. We did a full run at the end of rehearsal, and I looked around me to see that a handful of people had collapsed. It wasn't anything that couldn't be fixed with some water and shade, thankfully. The corps was great about getting us adequate breaks and making sure that we were well-hydrated."

We focused on the ballad since that was the slowest part of our show, but in sectionals percussion decided to focus on our feature, which was at 220 bpm. I remember when we hit the showers I was a dark red (no longer just tan), and my body was covered in salt from the constant sweating that dried up in a few minutes. Absolutely brutal. I'm still worried about getting skin cancer from that day just based on how I looked!"

After a couple of hours of floor time, woke up at noon for a half rehearsal day. We knew it was going to be bad when we started sweating the moment we stepped outside. It got up to around 120 with thick humidity, so who knows how much hotter it was on the turf. Of course that was also the day the staff decided we should work on the hardest part of the show which was a minute chunk at 220 bpm with very condensed box rotations and 4 count sets. It sucked a lot at the time, but looking back on it later in the season, we got so much better that day."

Thankfully, we ended rehearsal a few hours early to cool off prior to the show that evening. I walked to Sonic and got a root beer float to celebrate my survival (best root beer float ever).  There were some instances in 2011 (rehearsal days) where we got up really early and rehearsed in the morning, then took a 2-3 hour ""nap block"" around mid-day. We then went back outside after it had cooled off a bit and rehearsed a bit later into the evening. I really loved those days.

Rehearsal goes on until around 10:30 or so, and we go inside for a nap during the afternoon. Around 3:00, we wake up again, and do ensemble.

It's dumb to miss a show you could've potentially enjoyed over watching a hornline play 2 note lip slur.   Also, try to watch a little bit of each section from every corps even if it's not ""your section"" (example if you play a brass instrument, also watch the drumline and guard). Remember these are some of the top marching arts performers in the world, so it's easy to appreciate their talent even if you don't 100% comprehend the complexity of what they're playing/spinning/etc."
drumcorps,3d4kq0,umasstpt12,2,Mon Jul 13 14:51:24 2015 UTC,"Going along with that, if you can make it to the show 2 hours prior, you can still catch a corps or two warming up without missing the first few shows."

I guarantee you're not ready for the sheer quantity of sound they produce. Be open to being awed.  This is something that helps me enjoy the shows better, but it's not for everybody. After 10 different corps play 10 different shows, I tend to forget what I liked/didn't like about each. So after each show while the corps are getting on/off the field I take notes on my phone about the performance. What was the show title, did I like their props, which section was the strongest, did they do anything unique that I loved? That sort of thing. Helps me appreciate the scores better too - gives me a frame of reference to agree/disagree with the judging."

Get there early so you can get into the stadium as soon as the gates open, do your souvenir shopping then if you're wanting souvies, then get to your seat and enjoy.   The Warrensburg ToC show is always a great show, and the 7 corps this year could well be the top 7 finishers at finals.

drumcorps,3d4uvr,run_like_an_antelope,4,Mon Jul 13 16:34:58 2015 UTC,"The TOC shows use a different format for scheduling. The corps rotate the order so that in the course of the 8 show series: each corps goes first, each corps goes on last, and gives a much different feeling to the show. It also allows for I believe two-three corps small groups to perform around the venue throughout the event.  It is a very interesting setup. I personally liked the different setup. It actually gave the kids at Bloo a chance to see the other corps shows when they were on first or second. It was nice to have a few shows that helped break up the monotony of having such a similar order of appearance all summer."

drumcorps,3d35rg,DCI_Score_Bot,4,Mon Jul 13 04:44:02 2015 UTC,"Few observations:   Tonight went a lot better for Crown who passed SCV and ended up taking back the brass and guard captions.  Surprisingly, Cadets got 3rd in brass, interesting. Must have been an off night for them because their brass has been phenomenal this year.  BD beat out Cadets by a small margin, but I think Tour of Champions shows tend to favor them historically, isn't that right?  Phantom passed Cavaliers again, but there's still a large gap between them and the top 4 (5 with Bluecoats in the mix)  It'll be interesting to see where the Bluecoats fit in this mix. It feels like they haven't competed against one of the others in the top 5 this year in weeks.  Cavaliers guard still dragging them way under :/   All in all, seemed like a really interesting show with really interesting results. Can't wait for San Antonio!"
drumcorps,3d35rg,TubaMike,4,Mon Jul 13 03:52:03 2015 UTC,"BD beat out Cadets by a small margin, but I think Tour of Champions shows tend to favor them historically, isn't that right?   I wouldn't read too much into that.  BD has scored well in TOC shows the past couple of years because BD has, well, been awesome the past couple of years.  From '94 to '14, there was only one year that they didn't medal.  That's pretty good.    The 0.15 difference between BD and Cadets tonight indicates that the corps are ""neck and neck"" and that margin could very well be due to mid-season inconsistencies.  If you replayed this competition the next night with no rehearsals, the standings could easily flip.      I think that it is very unlikely that the judges consider if a competition is a TOC event when tabulating their scores.  Remember that each judge tabulates his (or her) scores independently of the others, and BD only won two subcaptions outright (GE1 and Music Analysis).  The Cadets, on the other hand, won four subcaptions (GE2, Vis Prof, Vis analysis, and Perc.).  The difference was that BD was much more consistent across the board.    The biggest margin between BD and Cadets seemed to be in colorguard, where BD was half a point ahead of the Cadets.  Whereas BD did not place lower than 3rd in any subcaption, Cadets placed 4th in CG.    I did not see the corps tonight, and even if I did, I'm not a colorguard specialist, so I cannot begin to argue against the ratings.  I don't think this gap in CG scores is due to this being a TOC competition and I don't think the CG judge conspired to make BD win (especially since Crown won CG tonight)."
drumcorps,3d35rg,ports84,3,Mon Jul 13 04:30:02 2015 UTC,"Also, Cadets percussion went from 3rd to 1st."
drumcorps,3d35rg,zackiedude,2,Mon Jul 13 07:15:45 2015 UTC,"I honestly was surprised Cadets got 3rd in brass. I thought they'd take it, with a challenge from Crown.  Not surprised at all by Crown taking the guard caption. I would've had them even further from BD. They're doing WGI-level work outdoors and achieving ridiculously well.  I think the Cavies guard needs to tone it down a little. If you look at Phantom, their book isn't the hardest (still the best Phantom guard in years), but they're achieving extremely well, and it impacts all visual captions because of it. I think the Cavies' book is too hard for that group, and at this point in the game they need to achieve well."

drumcorps,3d2qm7,UnlockTheShock,5,Mon Jul 13 01:47:22 2015 UTC,"In 2009, my indoor drumline tech told me and some of my classmates about some holes at a local corps. One kid in my high school had marched and had a great time. He talked a lot about corps but I had never been to a show or anything. A month or so later, on a snowy morning, my dad dragged me out of bed and drove me to my first rehearsal where I was blindsided by rehearsal and learning music and everything. They sent me home with mallets to practice with, as I didn't really know how to play at the time. For some silly reason, I fell in love with it. I didn't even watch a show for the first time until I went to the movie season premiere at the movie theaters. They played older shows too, and I specifically remember watching 2007 Bluecoats. I later saw my first live show the same day I performed my own first show.   TL;DR: I guess I just kind-of fell into it."

I got hooked in my sophomore summer of high school when I was learning to march quads and I found a full run of both the Cavies 2011 and Cadets 2011. Upon watching those I was sold and hooked, even more so as time went on."
drumcorps,3d2qm7,schmitz97,2,Mon Jul 13 04:16:07 2015 UTC,"(I really didn't mean for this to be so long but whatever, I'm leaving it. TLDR: found Phantom 2011 first, fell in love with Bloo 2013 then 2014 then 2015, hope to march Bloo 2016!)  My story's fairly similar to OP's, the first time I heard about drum corps was from my 6th grade (2008-09) beginner band director. He said he had marched with a drum corps called the Bluecoats, and all I could think was ""But he's a trumpet player, what was he doing in a drum corps and what the heck is a Bluecoat"". For some strange reason, probably the fact that we were quiet 6th graders, no one in my class ever asked him. Never got to either because he quit the next year to pursue Psychology:/   Never really thought about it again til my 9th grade year, just after I had finished my first high school marching season, when my band was learning Elsa's Procession to the Cathedral for our last concert. I fell in love with the piece and listened to it over and over on YouTube, so I inevitably saw one of the many comments saying Phantom Regiment's version was amazing. I took a look at an encore performance of it and then, this being the summer after they had played it in Juliet, I found a video of their closer. I was hooked, and I realize now I had found my first dream corps, but I had no idea how any of it worked. In fact I still have a vivid memory of somehow hearing online that marching PR cost $6000, trying to explain what little I knew about DCI to my mom, and getting shot down instantly because of that ridiculous price (no idea where I saw that number anymore).   So I ended up watching the 2013 Finals livestream with a bunch of friends, after subsisting totally off of YouTube videos and stuff my friends told me for a whole year. It was very interesting, especially the hype between BD and Crown that year, but I missed a lot of the show, especially the corps called the Bluecoats finishing 5th among all the other corps I was totally unfamiliar with.   I got way more into drum corps after that, and a few of my friends even started trying out for corps, which wasn't common because none of my band directors had marched in any corps and they never go out of their way to encourage it, which now seems irregular to me for a North Texas band. Eventually, right before the 2014 season started, I found a YouTube channel with the 2013 Finals runs of every top 12 corps except BD, so I watched through most of them til I came to the Bluecoats show and ended up loving it (not gonna lie the uniforms and the bari solos are what caught my eye).   Then Tilt happened (even got to see it live!) and there was no way I couldn't love Bloo, as a fairly new DCI fan. This led me to do a lot more research and I had even found this sub around that time, which gave me a much better understanding of what DCI is and how to get into it (no more $6000 scare haha), and without it there was likely no way I'd be able to tryout for any corps.   I still haven't marched anywhere but I went to Bloo's audition camp this past winter to get some experience and I loved it, their audition packet is still helping me be a much better player. I like to think I'm not just a typical Tilt fanboy because I found Bloo from their 2013 season, but it doesn't make much difference. I realize it wasn't a perfect show but it's very special to me (along with PR) because it was the push I needed to make myself better physically and musically so I can march with a corps, hopefully Bloo 2016, but I'd march anywhere just to experience DCI before I age out in 3 years. Now I just need to find out what year(s) my 6th grade teacher marched to bring it all full circle..."
drumcorps,3d2qm7,phantuba,2,Mon Jul 13 05:19:37 2015 UTC,"I was in eighth grade, and happened upon a video of a segment of Spartacus 2008. My first thought was ""Oh hey, Phantom Regiment is a really cool name,"" followed immediately thereafter by ""WTF is going on?"" Fast forward to partway through freshman year and I'm hanging out with some band friends and they pull up the same video, and I'm actually able to recognise what's going on and how cool it is. The next year I joined marching band (albeit for largely unrelated reasons), junior year I was encouraged to check out the open class corps that was nearest to us at the time, and when it came time to audition for world class, I knew exactly where I wanted to go.   It wasn't really in the story, but TL;DR is Brandt Crocker is the reason I marched Phantom."

I still wasn't interested in DCI. I ended up finding a Phantom Regiment show, and for a brief period of time, I was really interested in trying out for a corps, and Phantom was the only one I knew about, so I just looked into them. I lost interest about a day later (yeah, not too sure what happened), but I ended coming back to DCI later."

drumcorps,3d1iyk,logics8,9,Sun Jul 12 19:29:53 2015 UTC,"Oh oh oh! My time to shine!   I am paint crew leader at Cascades this summer. Here's what we do to measure a field. It takes about 25-30 minutes and we're working on getting even more efficient.   The front sideline should be 300' long. Once you set a FSL, mark every 15 feet to make a yard line, and take note of where your 50 yard line is.   After you set the FSL, you need to square the end zones. Take your tape measures and go to an end zone and from the 0 yard line, run a tape measure 160' and at the same time run a tape measure from the 40 yard line 200' to meet up with the 160' tape measure. Do that with both sides of your field. In theory and good practice, it makes a right triangle and squares it all off.   Once you square both sides of your field, run another tape measure from each 0 point of your squared back corners, and if all has gone right, it should read 300' and you should be able to mark your yard lines at the same spots as your front sideline ones! Beyond that is when you use a string to run lines front to back to paint. We also do gacks on the zeroes and 50 before we paint lines. The biggest thing to staying consistent is using the squaring method correctly every time."

As much as it shouldn't matter (and many say it doesn't), Racine would be compared to the group before it. While the members at Racine are doing an excellent job at working their butts off, competitively having them after certain groups make their efforts not seem as impressive.   Generally, when a certain grouping is still together, it's not a big deal (see Crossmen, Boston, Madison, Blue Stars). However, when Troopers have generally been sitting lower then that grouping, but are now performing AFTER Phantom and Cavaliers, it could seriously hurt Troopers. I'm not saying it will, I haven't seen the show lately, but from what I have seen early season, this lineup seems interesting to me.   Regardless, San Antonio should be a fun show!"

So and and so forth for 4-6, 7,-9, etc.   pretty sure ATL groupings will be based on the DCI SW scores."

As you start to add more corps, there's more comparison (now you're comparing BD, Crown, Cadets, and SCV), so numbers are stretched more.

A drumbeat can define a style and groove, and it is awesome that they incorporate groove into playing, but their music must certainly have more variety than a standard rock beat? Pulse should fluctuate to be eclectic and give that same 2 and 4 more distinction. At the least the drumset has the capacity to change the agogic emphasis and flow, so it just seems like a missed opportunity to some extent.  All the same, I aint gonna trash it either because using it as it is shows that they care about being musical, in the sense of the word that they find a soul in their beats."
drumcorps,3cyean,intramortem,4,Sun Jul 12 03:22:35 2015 UTC,I found it kind of distracting as a listener. Then I started listening to it as if I was a performer and I found I was able to 'feel' what they were playing better than with a metronome.

Technique wise the book is thick, chock full of octaves and licks that lay weird on the keyboard. The vibraphone part and piano parts are both beefed up compared to 14 as well. Good example of difficulty in the book is the contrary motion octave lick in the marimbas in the closer (can't link because on mobile). Sixteenth's in two directions holding octaves and crescendoing after an already difficult inner mallet run starting in a low register.

drumcorps,3czfxf,shacolwal,5,Sun Jul 12 04:30:58 2015 UTC,"Some of the higher tier groups use an iPad and special software to adjust the board from wherever in the stadium they may be. However, depending on different technical issues within the venue or other inevitable electronics failures, this sometimes doesn't work and a group can be left out to dry. Groups not using that method usually have a dedicated sound person on the field manning the board, but it's hard to balance an ensemble that you're barely 20 feet in front of, if that. In all of these cases a staff member is manning the board. Some groups have a staff member dedicated to sound, sometimes it's the arranger (if he's on tour), sometimes it's a pit tech who knows what they're doing, and sometimes they just have no clue.   What the electronics sounds like can also depend on where you're sitting. For example, if you're sitting around the 35-ish or wherever the speakers are, you're going to get a lot of that sound. It's also a lot different to be playing straight at a bunch of seats/concrete walls instead of the small stadiums and grass fields that corps are used to all day. You'd have to 180 the balance and many groups don't have the resources to get practice time in a stadium large enough to get even close to the acoustics of a stadium like TCF.   At the same time, it's still about a month until finals with plenty of adjustments to be made across the board. Electronic balance is no different."
drumcorps,3czfxf,somebodythatiusedtob,2,Sun Jul 12 05:36:24 2015 UTC,"Most of the time it is a pit tech on the field controlling it, or a dedicated sound guy on the phone with someone sitting at the box making active changes."
drumcorps,3czfxf,Lopzombie,2,Sun Jul 12 04:49:44 2015 UTC,There's usually a guy on the sidelines with a mixing board and a generator. It's not controlled by a member but the staff can tell the mixer what to adjust from the box (if I remember the rule change correctly).

drumcorps,3cws7m,Puntifex_Maximus,5,Sat Jul 11 17:06:50 2015 UTC,"If by heads you're talking about the drums on the rack, then the drums are different sizes and would produce different pitches and tones. If by heads you mean mallet heads for the bass drum, then each mallet head would be a different material. This material can be harder or softer, thicker or thinner, etc. A thicker, softer mallet would produce a more rumbling, thunder-like sound out of the drum. A thinner, harder mallet would make a sharper impactful sound (think marching bass drums). The flap for the bass drum is actually just a small towel that is attached to the rim and is used for muffling the drum to cut off the rumbling from hitting it. If the drum needs to be muffled and the part is pretty basic, then the player can just use his/her free hand, like in the beginning of the video. If the part is more complex and requires two mallets, then the player can flip down the towel rather than use his/her hand. Hopefully this makes sense!"

drumcorps,3cws7m,Shredder13,3,Sun Jul 12 01:35:19 2015 UTC,"It'd be more obvious if the audio weren't from the GoPro...   I'm by no means an expert on it, but the different heads on the mallets just produce different sounds when they hit the head of the drum... Due to the variation in hardness, compression, texture, etc.  The flap, which I believe is just a towel, helps dampen the head of the drum so it doesn't ring for as long."

drumcorps,3cuyk4,somebodythatiusedtob,10,Sat Jul 11 00:03:58 2015 UTC,You can still buy (slightly) better seats directly from various corps.
drumcorps,3cuyk4,drunk_corps,4,Sat Jul 11 01:01:02 2015 UTC,"And its been a few years since ive been to finals but there are always scalpers on the street, depending on what you want to pay.  But for real this is one of the reasons i dont like LOS. Too many seats in poor areas and you get really far from the action really quick. Up in the highest level you might as well be watching on dvd."
drumcorps,3cuyk4,fco83,3,Sat Jul 11 01:41:58 2015 UTC,The dvd would have better sound quality than you would get from the nosebleeds. Actually it would have better sound quality than you would get from basically anywhere inside LOS. How they deal with the reverb for the recordings is beyond me.
drumcorps,3cuyk4,princekamoro,5,Sat Jul 11 03:30:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah..  Its too bad Minneapolis doesn't have everyone there anymore. It wasn't finals quality, but with how bad the sound is in LOS it wasnt a big difference.  I hope dci eventually moves on from Indy."

drumcorps,3cuyk4,fco83,10,Sat Jul 11 07:54:43 2015 UTC,"Gambling time. Works best if you don't care about sitting with your group.   Buy the cheap seats. Head toward section 140 or 240 while pretending to talk on your phone. Look confident and head toward an open chunk of seats. Between corps, look like you're texting or get back on your phone.   I got to watch the top 6 from 5 rows back in 2013. In 2012 I was a little higher up, but still in section 140. Last year I got into section 139 for the top 10.   It's not foolproof, but if you want to go to finals and need to have box 5 seats, it can happen."
drumcorps,3cuyk4,spicycornchip,3,Sat Jul 11 04:58:56 2015 UTC,What happens if you get caught? What could happen?
drumcorps,3cuyk4,Bob_Swagetron,6,Sat Jul 11 06:18:26 2015 UTC,"Two scenarios happen to get ""caught"".  1) Person that actually owns the seat comes to claim it. In that case, just move to the next closest open seat. That's why I always look for a grouping of seats or just a singleton.   2) Security checks your ticket while you're sitting or on your way down. That's why I use the fake phone call with lines like ""...okay, I see where you are. I'll be right down."" If they do check the ticket I just give an ""okay"" and walk away to seats near the 25s or further out. When there's a break in the corps, move down the aisle toward the center.   In 7 years of being a staff member for various organizations, I have not once experienced being kicked out or even threatened that at finals. The worst case scenario is just a relocation, and even then there's always another try.   In 2011, my friend's wife walked right into Lucas Oil without a staff pass, ticket, or wristband and we got ourselves great finals seats! No offense to LOS security and ushers, but it's not a tough time getting into an open seat if you're willing to be creative."
drumcorps,3cuyk4,spicycornchip,2,Sat Jul 11 06:34:35 2015 UTC,You are either asked to move by the people that own the seats or by security. In 2012 I got to sit on the 50 for all of top twelve and only moved down a few rows once when I got 'caught'
drumcorps,3cuyk4,MegaBattleDuck,-1,Sat Jul 11 16:19:43 2015 UTC,"There are always assholes who alert stadium security when they see people roaming for seats. I don't get it, so they didn't pay for the seat. They're just sitting there watching. They're not changing my experience at all. When the real ticketholder comes up they always move. No seat roamers ever cause issues.   I've only roamed for semis, never for finals, but even then I didn't head to any really good seats. I just never went to the seats we bought that were beyond the end zone.   My advice to a roamer would be to pretend like you're making sure the seat number is matching the number on your ticket."

drumcorps,3cuyk4,Karinta,2,Sat Jul 11 07:41:22 2015 UTC,"My first DCI experience was last year at semis, with my group our band went on a trip to see it since our band director is staff with Troopers sitting by the left end zone. I still had a great first time, but we were seated in around 136. We're probably going to end up back there again.  Are seats towards the middle much better for drum corp? Or can I still keep on enjoying it on the far sides? I didn't notice too much about the sound, since I had learned beforehand from my own playing that LOS has some weird acoustics."
drumcorps,3cuyk4,felarine,2,Sat Jul 11 06:13:15 2015 UTC,"Yes. The closer to the middle you are, the sound gets so much better. In LOS I'd recommend trying as hard as possible to sit within the 35s."

drumcorps,3cvpg3,spicycornchip,3,Sat Jul 11 15:39:59 2015 UTC,"If memory serves me, ""The Commandant's Own,"" The United States Marine Drum & Bugle Corps , still uses G bugles. Although they obviously don't compete, please don't tell me that hornline doesn't produce the same sound quality any Bb hornline out there. I would argue that the reason you don't see G bugles anymore is that only one or two companies make them and those companies aren't sponsoring any corps."
drumcorps,3cvpg3,BrainGoesPop,4,Sat Jul 11 22:37:56 2015 UTC,"""The Commandant's Own"" play on 2 valve G Kanstuls.  They typically purchase a large amount at one time.    The Kanstul 2 valve G bugles are custom made per order---just as the 3 valve Kanstul G bugles.  Always have been.  Nothing is ever pulled off a shelf."
drumcorps,3cvpg3,Dauntit,3,Sat Jul 11 23:03:30 2015 UTC,Correct. I actually saw some 2 valve sopranos that the Marines ordered. They were beautiful.
drumcorps,3cvpg3,Dauntit,3,Sun Jul 12 06:06:34 2015 UTC,It's fairly apparent where The Kilties stand on the subject.   :-)  http://kanstul.net/category.php?category_search=Bugle&metaPage=Bugle
drumcorps,3cvpg3,bone-tone-lord,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:22:57 2015 UTC,"I think the main reason is that most corps now sell their instruments and buy new ones every season. This allows them to spend little, if any, money on instruments because corps can usually get sponsorships in the form of discounts from instrument companies in exchange for the advertising ability of having a drum corps play your instruments. The corps can then recoup most, if not all, of the cost of the instruments by selling them to schools, or occasionally poorer or lower-ranked corps that can't get sponsorships. In the case of corps buying professional-grade trumpets or solo instruments(flugels, trombones, etc.) they can also sell them to individuals. I'm sure corps realized they could do this with percussion before Bb/F horns were legalized, and jumped on the opportunity with the horns as soon as possible. The reason it wasn't possible with horns, however, was that no school and very few individuals want to buy instruments in a weird key, possibly without enough valves to play chromatically. A corps with Bb/F instruments can sell their equipment after the season and spend the money on other things like fuel, vehicles, staff, food, uniforms, etc..  One more thing that I almost forgot- aside from logistical reasons, Gs are MUCH harder to tune than Bb/F. A regular F mellophone, even a top-of the line horn like a YMP-204 or a Jupiter Quantum, is hard to play in tune. Gs are next to impossible. That's why old DCI hornlines, even in finals, sounded bad, especially the mellos. Given that you need your line to be better than most professional brass players to make top 6 now, corps aren't willing to sacrifice their placement because their horns are unusually difficult to tune.  Yet another thing- current members, and I say this as a current member of an Open Class hornline(we're off this week, which is why I have time to write this), simply don't want to play on G instruments. If your potential members don't want to play the horns you're telling them to play, good luck getting any members."
drumcorps,3cvpg3,Dauntit,2,Thu Jul 16 04:23:02 2015 UTC,"All horns, themselves, are nothing but the amplifiers, the mouthpiece is the instrument.  The Kilties use a full line of Kanstul G bugles (Sop Powerbores, mellos, regular and Grande baris) and DEG SuperMag 4 valve contras.

drumcorps,3cvpg3,fco83,0,Sat Jul 11 05:06:40 2015 UTC,"My guess is that G bugles are harder to tune.  Also, because most high schools use Bb horns, corps use the same Bb horns as well, so those who audition don't have to learn how to play a new instrument."

drumcorps,3cvpg3,Kamarag,4,Sat Jul 11 07:38:24 2015 UTC,"Kanstul G bugles are fantastic, especially the powerbore sopranos. I spent my rookie season on one. The Dynasty horn on the other hand, was one of the worst horns I had ever played. It had resistance similar to an average piccolo trumpet, no thanks.   I am glad to hear a Div 1 hornline on Kanstul horns again. Spirit hasn't been scoring that well, but I definitely enjoyed hearing their hornline in the lot."
drumcorps,3cvpg3,Karinta,6,Sat Jul 11 21:06:40 2015 UTC,"I've played and taught both G and Bb/F. G bugles can have a great sound, but it's more difficult to achieve in terms of sound quality and intonation than it is on Bb/F. Couple that with the fact that kids today have close to zero interest in playing in G, it's simply not worth the effort.  Back in the G bugle days, in a typical year you'd get one or two truly GREAT brass lines, and another two or three good ones. The rest? Pass.  Today, there are usually 10-15 great lines, and even the not so great ones would play rings around the average G line of yesterday."
drumcorps,3cvpg3,Kamarag,2,Sat Jul 11 13:08:58 2015 UTC,"This is mostly because the skill level of today's hornlines has vastly increased from what it was in the lines of yesteryear. A far greater percentage of each hornline has been studying music intensively for more of their life, and that translates almost instantly into a far better sound and sense of where the instrument lies with them with regard to intonation and sonic tendencies. It's not fair to compare the two eras without reference to the skill level of the lines; this creates the false impression that it's due to the instruments entirely.   Couple that with the fact that kids today have close to zero interest in playing in G, it's simply not worth the effort.   I would honestly doubt that they have zero interest in playing G bugles; one of the things that attracted kids back then was the difference from the band instruments, and that these people in corps were cooler than band people (somehow because they played these different-looking instruments), plus the increased skill level of the corps and the accompanying desire to achieve at that level.   Today, it's pretty much only the latter. There is no ""difference"" to set the corps apart, beside the lack of woodwinds. Not to say that people are less interested in corps - it's just that the above factor has been removed. If a hypothetical corps promoted its use of G bugles as a thing that ""sets them apart from the pack"", AND were very skilled, then I think that would generate interest in G bugles."

drumcorps,3cvpg3,Kamarag,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:04:57 2015 UTC,"I would give the same suggestion to you. There were many, many talented horn lines that played G bugles. Your statement flat out says that wasn't the case. Just as in the current day we shouldn't criticize all corps use of electronics because some corps use it to mask deficiencies in their horn lines, we also shouldn't make the erroneous criticism that there were, at most, only 5 good horn lines at any one time in the days of the G/F bugle. To do so pays a disservice to the many talented musicians of that day.   EDIT: Different does not equal inferior."
drumcorps,3cvpg3,junderdawg,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:49:16 2015 UTC,"No, I said ""truly great"". There were never more than two or three at most of those per year, and many times less.

Look, I won't deny that the kids today are talented musicians. That's obvious to anyone who has ears. But your disdain for the G bugle should not be used to run down the talent and quality of the musicians who played the G bugle.

But it's such a great story to tell that even some staff there at the time perpetuate the myth.  The fact of the matter is that they sounded like complete crap on G bugles when the rest of the activity had moved to Bb/F and taken a quantum leap forward in terms of sound quality and intonation. Pioneer was simply hamstringing themselves by not following suit."
drumcorps,3cvpg3,Karinta,2,Sat Jul 11 13:04:26 2015 UTC,"With someone who knows how to play both, the G horns will sound better (assuming that they are of comparable quality). G horns sometimes sound bad because of the player, the type of horn, or people not being used to them. If you gave crown all really good G horns and gave them time to get adjusted to them, they would absolutely sound better. The reason the rules changed was about money and in the end, the reason most corps changed was about money."

Brass section is hitting their stride after new staff in 2012 (is that the correct year?) and the music is phenomenally written for the Vanguard. Much different than when Shaw was at Regiment and even the closer has a different feel than when PR did it in 2006.   My vantage point wasn't great, so I didn't catch all of what the guard was doing on a first read. But, they do nothing but add to your focus visual and musically.  The design is great and everything about the show feels ""electric"". I don't mean that as a pun, either. I mean that they are really going after the underlying theme of the show and they don't let you forget what the show is about.

That's why we have microphones for soloists, synth parts playing over the corps for 1/3 the show, samples, and staffers running electronics instead of teaching members how to do it. Removing the corps members contribution cuts down on variables and lowers risk for the people who have turned summer youth music education staffer into a big business. You don't want to let some 20 year old trying to learn how to do this stuff screw up and hurt your scores and then risk the corps director firing you and taking away all your sponsorship money and having to cut your fees for HS bands because you are no longer an active drum corps show writer do you?"
drumcorps,3csv5t,spicycornchip,8,Fri Jul 10 17:44:09 2015 UTC,I thought the board only controlled mic levels and overall volume.  Not actual notes/samples being played and timing.
drumcorps,3csv5t,junderdawg,3,Fri Jul 10 18:44:43 2015 UTC,"It does. There was a rule change that first allowed staff to adjust levels, then allow them to adjust live, and then allow them to put somebody in the stands to get a better listen to the overall sound and relay to somebody down front controlling the board (or via iPad).   I think that's the progression of changes. Regardless, staff members might be making patches and creating sound samples, but members are the ones pushing the button for the performance."

drumcorps,3csv5t,Shredder13,7,Fri Jul 10 15:04:54 2015 UTC,"I'll give an example:  When I saw the Cavaliers 007 show live in 2004, there was a moment where the horns where facing backfield, and the 007 theme could be heard in a strange, eerie, high-pitched kind of tone. I found myself searching the pit, trying to figure out where the sound was coming from. I expected to find someone playing wine glasses or a bowed saw or something... It took me a few seconds to realize that what I was hearing was the hornline WHISTLING the tune. The ""ah-hah"" moment that came was one of the coolest things I, as an audience member, have experienced in drum corps.  Today, if I heard a similar sound, I'd say ""cool synth patch,"" and move on. No ah-hah moment, no big burst of applause, nothing for the ""performer"" who had the talent to press ""play"" at the right time.  The same thing could be said for the singing in Crown's 2004 show. The performers could sing, and it sounded good, and was impressive and applause-worthy. The effect would have been completely lost if it had been pre-recorded.  I want to be impressed again."
drumcorps,3csv5t,nichampagne,6,Fri Jul 10 16:19:38 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you have a problem with the design, not instrumentation. Those ""ah-hah"" moments are still there: Cavaliers 2008 backfield pitch drop, all the singing this year, Cadets 2007 horn moves.    nothing for the ""performer"" who had the talent to press ""play"" at the right time.   You don't consider synth players to be performers? That's just straight-up ignorant. You could say that about so many other students. ""Nothing for the drum major to do but wave their arms at the right time."" ""Nothing for the dance line to do but move their body."""
drumcorps,3csv5t,Shredder13,-7,Fri Jul 10 16:29:14 2015 UTC,"Ouch. My main instruments are piano and organ, I know full well that synth players are performers. And when they're performing music, they certainly are.  How would you feel if you went to a symphony concert to hear 1812 Overture, and at the beginning, a man in a tuxedo brought out a CD player, placed it on the stage, pressed ""play,"" and then walked off, while you listened to a recording of 1812 Overture. Is that man a performer? Did he do anything to earn your applause?"
drumcorps,3csv5t,Shredder13,9,Fri Jul 10 16:35:15 2015 UTC,"No. But if he triggered every note like the performers in DCI, I would."
drumcorps,3csv5t,stevebates14,-3,Fri Jul 10 17:21:13 2015 UTC,I wonder if we saw video of just how many times the synth players pressed a key we'd be less than impressed.  I've always thought if thats part of the reason you can never clearly see their hands and boards when they are in the pit.  They don't want you to see how easy it looks.
drumcorps,3csv5t,nichampagne,5,Fri Jul 10 17:31:11 2015 UTC,"I've always thought if thats part of the reason you can never clearly see their hands and boards when they are in the pit.

You can also just use your ears to hear what they're playing."
drumcorps,3csv5t,Shredder13,-5,Fri Jul 10 18:58:27 2015 UTC,"Triggering every note would mean not using long pre-recorded vocal tracks. My complaint is about a 30-second vocal track that is one single sample, triggered by someone pressing a key on a synth once... Having to play every note would go a long way towards alleviating this annoyance."
drumcorps,3csv5t,junderdawg,5,Fri Jul 10 20:40:47 2015 UTC,"Having to play every note would go a long way towards alleviating this annoyance   That's actually the current rule, unless they changed it after it was first passed."
drumcorps,3csv5t,backgrinder,3,Fri Jul 10 21:15:06 2015 UTC,This is just wrong. You cannot use anything that dictates tempo. The samples must be cut off and played individually. So that 30 second sample? It's someone playing each individual note and vowel in time with the drum majors. They just get so good at it that it seems flawless. Your entire argument is so ignorant.
drumcorps,3csv5t,junderdawg,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:38:15 2015 UTC,"At a show earlier this week, I watched a single player hit a synth pad once to trigger a multi-phrase vocal sample. It was definitely not being cut off and played individually. I wish I could remember who it was....  In any case, that's not really my complaint. My real complaint is that there was almost certainly a performer on the field capable of singing that part, but instead, we heard someone else's (probably not even one of the corps members) recorded voice. That's what bothers me."
drumcorps,3csv5t,backgrinder,2,Sat Jul 11 09:34:30 2015 UTC,"I agree.  There is a lot of people around the activity who are uncomfortable with amplification (myself included). While not entirely a bad thing, there should be limits. It started out as just amplification of just the pit instruments, then added synth boards, now full on looping and samples added.  I thought the rules were that every note had to be played/articulated, it doesn't seem like thats the case anymore. How long before we have a show where at least one horn member is playing into a mic for the entire show? How long before the number of speakers on the field outnumber a brass section?  I won't deny that I have a big problem with the fact that bluecoats have so many speakers on the field this year. It just isn't impressive. Sure, electronic music and sounds are cool, I like them.  But thats not what I want to hear, I want to hear live music performed by 150+ members that rips my face off.  Don't you feel slightly cheated somehow when those 150 players are overpowered by one member pressing 3 buttons down on keyboard? I do. Its not impressive, its pandering to the younger crowd that likes the electronic sound."
drumcorps,3csv5t,junderdawg,4,Fri Jul 10 16:43:13 2015 UTC,"That's a slippery slope argument if I've ever heard one!  All the Bluecoats are doing is delay and sampling. This isn't replacing anyone, as the whole brass line is still playing."
drumcorps,3csv5t,backgrinder,-1,Sat Jul 11 00:01:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your points.   I actually really like the Bluecoats show this year. It was very cool to experience live, and actually had lots of those ""ah-hah"" moments that I love so much. I think their use of synthesizers and sampling is very innovative and interesting (I would not consider sampling something you play live and then looping it to be a ""pre-recorded sample"").  I do agree 100% about the volume issue though. It's just not as much fun to have your face ripped off by speakers as by a really loud (and really good) hornline. Feeling ""cheated"" is a good way to describe it."
drumcorps,3csv5t,junderdawg,-8,Fri Jul 10 16:51:15 2015 UTC,"A time will come where ""drum corps"" will be nothing but stationary electronics outside the boundaries of the field, while on-field will be nothing but dancers and people manipulating props. Bugles have become extinct in drum and bugle corps. Drums will probably go the same way.   Here's what I've been wondering. DCI has always been ""marching music"". Since when are electric or electronic instruments considered marching instruments?  EDIT: Downvote all you like, but consider this first - at one time, DCI penalized heavily for either speaking or singing on the field. No one was allowed outside the boundaries of the field. Electric/electronics were prohibited. Things change, so why would ""nothing but electronics"" be outside the realm of possibility?  And downvotes don't explain how electric/electronic instruments came to be considered marching instruments."
drumcorps,3csv5t,BullshitBlocker,4,Fri Jul 10 17:02:09 2015 UTC,Since the 70's when every high school and college band in the country had electronics (I always lol when people tell me how cutting edge this stuff is). They used to have wheeled carts for amps and synth players and bass guitar players would march next to them and play their parts. For real.
drumcorps,3csv5t,backgrinder,-1,Fri Jul 10 17:13:44 2015 UTC,"Really?  I marched in the '70's both HS marching band and drum corps. Our HS band marched in MBA (the original name of BOA). I can't recall ever seeing that in the '70's either locally or nationally in MBA. First time I recall seeing them was in the mid '80's in marching bands that were so small that they only had one or two tuba players and needed something to round out the bass parts. Most marching bands were still telling those kids ""sorry, but this is marching band. You picked the wrong instrument. You're welcome to try out for jazz band, though""."
drumcorps,3csv5t,BullshitBlocker,4,Fri Jul 10 17:26:00 2015 UTC,"So you both saw it and did not see it, is what you're telling me? Not sure if you are trying to disagree with me (as your tone seems to indicate) or are amplifying on my point (as your statement seems to indicate). Anyways, this was fairly common in the 70's and 80's, more likely at smaller bands trying to fill holes than bigger bands but hey, smaller bands outnumber the big MBA/BOA groups by a very large margin. There was also a stretch where everyone had to try a singer. That fad ended fairly quickly (it's already dying in drum corps too) but it was there."
drumcorps,3csv5t,backgrinder,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:37:38 2015 UTC,"I'm saying I first noticed the usage in the mid '80's, not the '70's. I'm also saying that usage does not ""make it so"".   I'll admit that as far as this subreddit goes, I'm most definitely an ""old fogey"". I have learned to accept and even appreciate the oversized percussion pits of today (although I still find them somewhat unnecessary in terms of being able to put a balanced musical sound and performanc on the field). What I have more of a problem with is the ever growing usage of electronics and synthesizers on field. When I hear a modern corps take the field and I see 14, 15 or 16 tubas on the field and the bass sound I hear is obviously coming from a synth, I can't help but think ""why""? I think I could live with the synths if they were limited to providing something that couldn't be produced by something else on the field. But when it comes to using synths and their amplification as the primary source of both bass and volume, I don't like it."
drumcorps,3csv5t,junderdawg,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:06:51 2015 UTC,"I'm also saying that usage does not ""make it so"".   I have no ideas what you mean hear but it was never my intention to claim use of these things was ubiquitous, just that it was around, and using it in drum corps was never the innovation so many claimed it was.   When I hear a modern corps take the field and I see 14, 15 or 16 tubas on the field and the bass sound I hear is obviously coming from a synth, I can't help but think ""why""?   I completely agree with your frustration at this. If you are actually wondering why it's simple: most drum corps show designers look at marching members as a visual element, and most of them would be every bit as happy with prerecorded music as they are with live musicians, happier in many cases because prerecorded music is always the same and using it eliminates a lot of the variables that go into live performance."
drumcorps,3csv5t,themookish,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:17:02 2015 UTC,"You and I have many more points of agreement than we do disagreement. In fact, I don't think we really disagree at all. I guess what I'm trying to say is that while people may use electric/electronics on the marching field, that doesn't mean that these instruments really are marching instruments.   And your observations about MM's being regarded as visual elements are, I think, spot on. That's why I posted earlier on the thread that drum corps could become nothing more than (basically) synths and dancers/prop manipulaters. Which, by the way, continues to be downvoted."

drumcorps,3csv5t,savedsid,3,Fri Jul 10 17:41:43 2015 UTC,I think you are responding a bit strongly. This looked to me like a proposal that just requires marching members to perform everything in the show during the show. Seems pretty fair to me for a judged live musical activity.

drumcorps,3cre2g,baeanddot,3,Fri Jul 10 04:04:42 2015 UTC,"Hi! I'm a baritone/trombone player who got their braces off about a month ago.  For some people, there are no big effects when they get their braces off. Sure, their range will get better, but other than that pretty much nothing changes.  For others (including me) the first week or two kind of suck. Your range goes away for a little while. You might find it a little hard to play without putting pressure on your lips (don't do this!). The most important thing is to avoid building bad habits. Practice your basics over and over. It'll be frustrating, but worth it. After a few weeks, my range opened up. Before, high G was my highest note, and even then it was hard for me to pop out. After, my range is ridiculously open, and I can get up to high B. Stick with it no matter what.   On practicing, be careful with your chops. My understanding of many woodwind instruments is that they aren't as bad on your mouth as brass can be. Luckily baritone is pretty easy on your lips, but you should still make sure you don't overpractice. It's doing you no good if you can't even reach the notes you need because your mouth is dead. Practice smart."

drumcorps,3cpwuo,Stealyobike,3,Thu Jul 9 23:26:19 2015 UTC,Still a little bit of the TEN before the company front... ;)

drumcorps,3cpwuo,Nassan33,15,Fri Jul 10 00:31:50 2015 UTC,"Musically it starts out strong and then looses my interest up until the closer. The drill is incredible and so is their percussion. That Mello line is pretty hot too. All around its a great show but it just doesn't keep my interest musically. Prefer Crown's show but I would be almost as happy with cadets winning it all, as long as BD doesn't win."
drumcorps,3cpwuo,Shredder13,5,Thu Jul 9 21:44:28 2015 UTC,"usically.    Check out the pit during the ballad. Insane amount of musicality and some REALLY innovative arranging.  Also, they have the best french horn feature in DCI."
drumcorps,3cpwuo,Nassan33,5,Fri Jul 10 02:23:12 2015 UTC,"I agree they have the best french horn feature. It is a truly beautiful moment in DCI. While the pit impresses me, it just doesn't hold my interest. Maybe it's because I'm a brass guy but I'm generally pretty good about being able to recognize outstanding music in areas outside of just brass. I think it just makes me think more about an actual concert or recital setting and less about drum corps. Just my personal opinion about their music. I still think their show is fantastic and deserving of a top two spot at finals."

drumcorps,3cpwuo,intramortem,2,Thu Jul 9 23:09:41 2015 UTC,"This is my favorite show of the year, mainly because of the drum break.

drumcorps,3cpwuo,intramortem,2,Fri Jul 10 02:20:48 2015 UTC,"Reminds me of their 2013 show, which is another one of my favorites. Straightforward, awesome, intense music.   They should do this stuff more often."
drumcorps,3cpwuo,CreativePhilosopher,2,Fri Jul 10 03:29:56 2015 UTC,"If a members perspective is allowed...  I think even if I didnt march the show I would be in love with it. For context, side by side is one of my absolute favourite shows and it is easy to say i have a preference for modern dci with this in mind.  There are some moments that are very not my taste, namely the ballad intro, first half of the finale and I wish the ballad itself was much longer. However, the rest of the show resonates with me really well and has all the qualities of a drumcorps show that i could possibly ask for."

Go Cadets!"
drumcorps,3cpbqs,spicycornchip,4,Thu Jul 9 19:26:19 2015 UTC,GE doesn't necessarily equal entertainment.
drumcorps,3cpbqs,mafiaman2200,-2,Thu Jul 9 22:07:06 2015 UTC,GE is entertainment
drumcorps,3cpbqs,spicycornchip,2,Fri Jul 10 00:22:14 2015 UTC,"GE is audio and visual coordination, originality, variety of effect, interpretation, originality, AND a package that engages the audience. That's just on the rep side. You can have something entertaining, but fail to entertain. You can have a show with a ton of coordinated effect moments, but the performers don't pull them off either musically or visually (or both).   Entertainment, I feel, is the total of these (give or take).  Have a show that contains a variety of effects and almost always pull them off (box 4)? That's effective! Doing something that's never been done before, or something old in a new way? That's effective! Playing a scary show (Inferno) and having the audience understand it's a scary show? That's effective!  If you're playing a show that's effectively designed and performed, an audience member might not be entertained. Play a show with the singular goal of entertaining the audience, it might not be as effective."
drumcorps,3cpbqs,cadet311,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:54:16 2015 UTC,"GE is entertainment?  If that's the case, I assume BD scores low in GE. Because they aren't entertaining."

Not as entertaining as Tilt, but damn good.  EDIT: Here's a video of part of the ballad in the lot. Something about that trumpet at the beginning gets me every time."

drumcorps,3coe5u,petekMw,6,Thu Jul 9 23:26:11 2015 UTC,"I like it a lot, but that's just because i'm into the modern drum corps thing. They do a ton of stuff with the direction of the sound and they play with the environment a lot, so as such, it's a totally different show live. Musically, we have to appreciate the ballad, as it is the year of the ballad, and this show has one of the good ones. I love the effect of the echoey trumpet thing and the euphonium solo/soli is gorgeous. However, I don't think the opening with the big major chord works too well. It really feels like a Crown closer. As for the stuff in between, it's just rad. They constantly come at you with crazy ideas whenever you least expect it. A bit of the stuff that they attempt throughout the show doesn't seem to work though, like some of the tuba stuff (damn bluecoats love their tubas) and I feel like the staff is gonna fix all of that before finals. As such, I think that when the end of the season rolls around, this show is gonna be a force to be reckoned with. The major concern that everybody has is ""is this Tilt v2?"" and to extent I think it is. But I think the major difference is how obvious the concept is in both shows, because the concept of ""kinetic noise"" in this show seems WAAAY more in your face than the concept of ""tilting"" last year. I think whether that's a good or bad thing is up to the viewer."
drumcorps,3coe5u,AustinTheGeek,6,Thu Jul 9 14:36:18 2015 UTC,"I've only seen it once at the premiere, but my initial thoughts after seeing it were ""This show is like the love child of E=MC2 and Tilt, and I am okay with that."""
drumcorps,3coe5u,Greenfire323,5,Thu Jul 9 22:25:16 2015 UTC,"I love this show a lot! I think the best way to describe why I do is because of the musical content and theme.

drumcorps,3coe5u,run_like_an_antelope,3,Thu Jul 9 14:19:03 2015 UTC,"I adore it. I think it's genius. Favorite show of the season.  The first time I saw it, when all the noise is building in the beginning, and I'm starting to think that just maybe they're completely off their rocker, the first hit comes and BAM insta-chills, I'm in love.  The intensity and beauty of the show is incredible. It's never boring. We'll talk about the end in a moment...  The colors, textures, ambiance, melody, and tension-and-release within the music is unlike any show I've ever experienced. Their musical selection and arrangement is both incredibly unique, and wonderfully adapted for drum corps performance. Their musical choices really are exactly what I didn't even know I needed out of drum corps. Before even discussing the electronics, their writing is in my opinion unmatched in DCI today.  Here's the thing about me and electronics/amplification. Before I saw Tilt, I was completely against their use in drum corps (and still kind of am... My God! Will someone make the singing stop??!!). It really wasn't until Tilt that any sort of potential with electronics in drum corps was realized - up until that moment, electronics were a sort of ancillary nuisance to the activity in my mind. Tilt changed that - by providing a moment that was still definitively drum corps - that relied on creativity and electronics.  Kinetic Noise again defies my distaste for electronics, because they are doing incredible/innovative stuff musically with it. They are giving me shows that I absolutely love, creating moments that feel so right, creating great music.  I'm entertained from start to finish. Drill design is great, suiting the music very well and keeping your eyes (and ears) moving around the field with the various stereo effects taking place.  Speaking of, I'm sure not everyone who sees the show understands what all is taking place. That there are various mic/speaker combos on the field - that members are live-sampling and looping their music. The textures and grooves this creates while parts are layered together are out of this world, and again groundbreaking in the activity.  So there's this amazing, beautiful, intense show - then you get to the ending and your'e thinking, ""how can they possibly top Tilt last year,"" and then the answer hits you - they don't. Or don't even try. ""It just fizzles out?!! WTF is that???""  So the ending... I really disliked it at first. Then after many, many viewings, I see it. I get it. It really does fit perfectly in the concept of the whole show. Again... beautiful, artful genius. Having said that, I want what everybody else wants out of a DCI ending - to be leaping out of my seat, screaming my fool head off while goosebumps shoot from head to toe, and this ending ain't it.  Tilt had a similar, kind of weird ending for much of the season before they fixed it and nailed it. Hoping for the same this year.  All in all, among my favorite shows of all time. Fun, intense, creative, powerful and beautiful. What more could I ask for? Oh yeah, a new ending and a gold medal."
drumcorps,3coe5u,superOOk,4,Fri Jul 10 19:46:43 2015 UTC,"One of the best shows of the season. Totally groundbreaking with their use of electronics (a half mile of cabling!). I believe much of the future of drum corps will learn from this year's show and no doubt improve upon it. While it might not win, this season is likely never to be forgotten."
drumcorps,3coe5u,defeldus,3,Thu Jul 9 18:19:29 2015 UTC,"The whole show grooves so hard and I can't wait to see it live. Second best drill of the year (behind SCV) and lots of melody throughout. I think I like it better than Tilt already, but I'll wait till I see it in person to decide. I hope they can polish it enough to fight for a top three spot, and even better if they can win it all."
drumcorps,3coe5u,drumsdrumsdrumsyea,2,Thu Jul 9 19:22:36 2015 UTC,They made a minimalist drum corps show with the music that is probably not often associated with drum corps. What they're doing I'd awesome and how they use electronics and the environment are great.
drumcorps,3coe5u,TheBigBoner,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:30:50 2015 UTC,"I absolutely love the show but I just do not like the ending at all. I know they've been known to change it mid season, and they certainly did so remarkably last year, but IMO this year the ending needs changed more than it has for years."
drumcorps,3coe5u,CreativePhilosopher,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:23:10 2015 UTC,"love it!  the antiphonal brass is making more sense to me now, as is the way that they're playing with all sound throughout the production.   they're already marching it much better than they were marching the amazing tilt at this point last season, and i think the visual design is a step up from last year.    each piece of the show works great.  my only slight criticism is that i think it needs more of a melodic or rhythmic thread to tie all of the amazing pieces together musically.  i fully acknowledge that maybe there already is one, and i'm just missing it, but i'm not a complete musical dilettante, and it hasn't hit me yet.  maybe i just need to see it a few more times.  no matter what, i'm confident the staff will find a way to elevate it.  so will the performers.  they're definitely buying into the show just as much as they did with tilt."

The changes are either forgettable or a step back (the horns, echo, horns 8ths changing to that trill -> impact especially kills the momentum of the end of the opener). The show also doesn't resolve, TILT was a masterpiece of building tension and having the most satisfying conclusion ever, this one literally fizzles out after having all that build up in the closer. I hope they have a trick up their sleeve and add a big ending bit, or else I could see them slipping from medals."

No narration or long novel needed to explain the show concept.  Blue Knights 14 was one of my favorite BK shows Boston Crusaders, not a fan of the music book, but great concept and it was fun to watch them take a jab at DCI all season I wasn't a fan of Blue Devils' design, but I appreciated how spotless clean they were.

drumcorps,3cm0p3,gandalf45435,3,Thu Jul 9 03:21:04 2015 UTC,"Heard them in their first performance in West Monroe. Can confirm, they sound great."
drumcorps,3cm0p3,Baptism_Of_Solitude,3,Thu Jul 9 02:38:46 2015 UTC,"Great job tonight, guys and gals!"
drumcorps,3cm0p3,TubaNinja164,2,Thu Jul 9 02:45:50 2015 UTC,Wooohoooo
drumcorps,3cm0p3,mphsaxophone,2,Thu Jul 9 02:04:52 2015 UTC,Heard them in the lot next to us- damn! Sounded great. Excited to see where they go!
drumcorps,3cm0p3,dudegjl,2,Thu Jul 9 02:09:57 2015 UTC,Yaaaassss
drumcorps,3cm0p3,acethewarhawk,2,Thu Jul 9 02:11:38 2015 UTC,"Louisiana has a LOT of musical talent. Once these guys get rolling and get finances figured out in the next few years, they're gonna be great. (Maybe some Louisiana bias, but eh whatever). Wish they had this when I was in high school in Louisiana. Good luck guys!"
drumcorps,3cm0p3,Thezman007,2,Thu Jul 9 04:05:05 2015 UTC,Eyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
drumcorps,3cm0p3,Sgt_KICKASS,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:03:58 2015 UTC,Dats mah corps :D
drumcorps,3cm0p3,highpowered,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:04:25 2015 UTC,Looks like they are continuing the tradition of great Southern hornlines!
drumcorps,3cmc26,helo323,28,Thu Jul 9 00:51:40 2015 UTC,"Great music, love the ballad. Awful boring drill, hate the closer."
drumcorps,3cmc26,CharlieWhizkey,8,Thu Jul 9 02:18:46 2015 UTC,"Give that 3D pyramid in the opener some credit, yo."
drumcorps,3cmc26,CharlieWhizkey,8,Thu Jul 9 02:36:27 2015 UTC,"I mean, it's recycled at this point. If they keep putting it in for future shows I guess it could become a ""classic"" or ""standard"" bit of drill for Crown, but nowhere close to the classic that the crown drill is at."
drumcorps,3cmc26,druler,2,Thu Jul 9 03:11:10 2015 UTC,"Kind of like how the Cadets copy drill every year they used the Z-pull, amirite?"
drumcorps,3cmc26,Karinta,2,Thu Jul 9 02:42:01 2015 UTC,"Only in 83 and 84. In 90 they did an ""S-pull"" for Sylvester (and then reversed it)."
drumcorps,3cmc26,Spontaneity8,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:40:10 2015 UTC,I've heard about the z-pull a lot and i've asked around but nobody really explained it to me? What is it exactly?
drumcorps,3cmc26,BACsop,3,Thu Jul 9 10:33:30 2015 UTC,Here is the Z-Pull in 1983.
drumcorps,3cmc26,thirstypartner,6,Thu Jul 9 06:03:00 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say copy so much as reuse, and even then, 3D drill in general is badass. To each their own. ¯_(ツ)_/¯"
drumcorps,3cmc26,jonboy345,5,Thu Jul 9 10:30:21 2015 UTC,I really liked that they did a cube in 2012 and did a pyramid in 2013. It -- more or less -- fit the theme without being repetitive. The 2015 pyramid is too similar to 2013 for me to enjoy it as much as I did seeing it the first time.
drumcorps,3cmc26,spicycornchip,6,Thu Jul 9 02:50:40 2015 UTC,\   you forgot your arm...
drumcorps,3cmc26,fishtiano,3,Thu Jul 9 03:30:05 2015 UTC,"Putting down a similar visual effect doesn't get easier years down the road. You've got new members, it always starts out dirty, and the setup into the drill move is always different. I'm not sure it fits just right in the spot it's at in the show, but a move from 2013 isn't easy just because the 2013 corps did it."
drumcorps,3cmc26,MilkshakeG,2,Thu Jul 9 13:40:44 2015 UTC,"I understand now, my bad. Didn't really think about the fact that reusing a visual effect was a thing."
drumcorps,3cmc26,BACsop,4,Thu Jul 9 05:32:31 2015 UTC,Its so boring to watch. The drill is not exciting and their technique isn't even fun to look at
drumcorps,3cmc26,Gooberplease,4,Thu Jul 9 06:04:09 2015 UTC,"I have to say the drill definitely comes across as sterile and uninspired on video, but in person there is a lot of interesting body/feet work that goes with the music quite well. I still think their visual program is a weakness overall for them this year, but I liked it better after seeing the show live."
drumcorps,3cmc26,DrHellstrom,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:34:26 2015 UTC,"Hm, interesting. I like the drill! I mean,  its not super exciting, but I don't think it's awfully boring."
drumcorps,3cmc26,the_crown_fits,11,Thu Jul 9 10:32:54 2015 UTC,"I'm totally on board with everything up until the end of the ballad, it's my favorite show of the year so far. That being said, the transition into the closer feels wrong and the rest of it just isn't as satisfying as it should be. I'm pretty sure they're changing it and may be doing that soon since they're on a 3 day rehearsal stretch."
drumcorps,3cmc26,LordPringus,2,Thu Jul 9 04:54:11 2015 UTC,Yes! I really hope that closer gets changed. It was all hype and then somewhat of a letdown at the end. That would be a gripe for the show.
drumcorps,3cmc26,themookish,14,Thu Jul 9 01:52:41 2015 UTC,The music fits. The uniforms fit. Not sure the closer fits.
drumcorps,3cmc26,thedumbdown,2,Thu Jul 9 02:03:29 2015 UTC,Those new changes tho
drumcorps,3cmc26,dpengu_,8,Thu Jul 9 02:27:41 2015 UTC,I love the music. Percussion has stepped up their game this year. The large cloth drape is awkward and the words on it are a bit campy.
drumcorps,3cmc26,GhastliestPayload,7,Thu Jul 9 22:38:26 2015 UTC,"When I first saw the drape come over the entire hornline at the big hit, my jaw dropped… and that was a YouTube video. I will probably need to bring a change of pants for nightbeat."
drumcorps,3cmc26,iSEESOUNDS619,3,Thu Jul 9 00:57:42 2015 UTC,Yeah. My lady doesn't watch it with me and I showed it to her and she was pretty impressed.
drumcorps,3cmc26,CharlieWhizkey,3,Thu Jul 9 01:21:23 2015 UTC,I'm so hype to see the show grow and expand; even my desktop got in on it.
drumcorps,3cmc26,iSEESOUNDS619,3,Thu Jul 9 02:36:38 2015 UTC,"The repertoire is beyond incredible. I think everyone has focused on Dies Irae and how good it is, but I think the more theme-relevant piece is right after that: Symphony for Organ and Orchestra by Copland. The dissonance is a great change of pace for Carolina Crown from past years where they stayed primarily in the major chord realm. And it is impressive to hear the harsh chords they can make. That being said, Ode to Joy just doesn't have...joy for lack of a better term. The pieces, though all fantastic in their own regard, seemed disjointed, and Ode to Joy is the biggest culprit of this. The tonal shift is just jarring and doesn't fit the theme well at all.  As for the visuals, Crown is doing fantastic things with their colorguard, and that is just about it for how much of their visual drill that impresses me. To me it seems like the drill is not very well inspired. The most thought-out portion was the beginning where the corps made 9 circles for the 9 circles of hell, but that's a motif that they never expand upon.  Overall, the theme is quite interesting and executed very well, with the major blip being their visual design. And, as always, there is their percussion. Though they are making fantastic strides in the percussion section, comparatively they just are not able to hold a candle to other corps who are known for their good percussion. That might change over the next month, but as previous records show, Crown consistently scores lower in the percussion caption in the latter half of the tour."
drumcorps,3cmc26,Vairman,11,Thu Jul 9 02:24:16 2015 UTC,"The whole thing kind of bores me,  its impressive but just doesn't hold my attention too well"
drumcorps,3cmc26,JaffinatorDOTTE,4,Thu Jul 9 05:34:51 2015 UTC,"Can't believe people are downvoting you. OP asked how you liked it, you responded with how you liked it."
drumcorps,3cmc26,lespaultyler,2,Thu Jul 9 02:42:31 2015 UTC,"What show this year, and what of that show impresses you?   edit: or i guess holds your attention. To me Inferno is the most visually appealing show this year. The crownGUARD is phenomenal. The whole hornline writhing in hell under the fire tarp in the ballad gets me every time."
drumcorps,3cmc26,defeldus,4,Thu Jul 9 03:12:13 2015 UTC,"I actually so like the opening of the show, but out of what I've seen so far BD is my my favorite show to watch unless I could watch my own while playing it"
drumcorps,3cmc26,Shredder13,2,Thu Jul 9 03:17:44 2015 UTC,"I love every little bit of it - so much so I bought a tour shirt at Clifton.  I'm not a Crown fan boy but I love this show!! I love the cloth ""drapes"", I love the music, I love the drill - I even love what the guard is doing.  Yep, I love all of it. Yay Crown!  <edit> It is SO much better live than on the screen.  It's my favorite until I see ""Kinetic Noise"" in person at which point I think it will change."
drumcorps,3cmc26,intramortem,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:19:38 2015 UTC,"The change to the closer will (hopefully) be great and will win a lot of people over, I think. They play, move and spin great, and just need to iron out the ending (as is the annual science fair for that drum corps). One of my favorite Crown shows, probably top 3 with 2009 and 2013."
drumcorps,3cmc26,Shredder13,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:15:34 2015 UTC,"It has grown on me every time I watch it and I love it now. It's a really freakin good show. Dies Irae and the ballad are the highlights for me. The closer changes every year so this one is obviously just a placeholder. In fact they're learning the new one now. Hopefully that will connect the whole show together and by the end of the season, it will be truly incredible."
drumcorps,3cmc26,asdf072,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:18:11 2015 UTC,"My 3rd favorite Crown show ever (behind 2013 and 2009). It knocked 2012 out of its place. I think this might be their best brass line yet, and their best battery since 09. Amazing guard that has a chance of winning the caption and clean visual overall. If they can pull off a good ending then they will medal."
drumcorps,3cmc26,madd227,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:42:31 2015 UTC,"I definitely like it more than anything they've put out since 2007. Their colorguard is crazy good this year, so that alone will keep them near the top.   The show design has a lot of strange quirks that still stick out:   Different size hats. Seriously, are their flame things ripping? Or were they designed that way? I hate those hats anyway (being able to see everyone's heads when they turn sideways or backwards), but it's weird to see each one be different.  Lack of field use. They start with a line around the back hashes, then the hornline comes together for pretty much the duration of the show. They only go past the back hashes once, and that's to do their upside down pyramid. It's blob here...dance a little...scatter to your next set...march some difficult drill with cool lines for 5 seconds...stop...kneel...get up...march for another 5 seconds...dance...end of movement. Next movement: March while the drumline plays. Next movement: March slowly and kneel in a blob for a minute or so. Next movement: March some cool drill with cool lines...stop...park and bark...rush the stands...park and bark...end. Is it cool? Sometimes. Effective? Mostly. Exciting? No. Every other corps out there is constantly running and spreading out and coming together and spreading out and going crazy on that field, it seems.  Percussion. They're better than ever, but still 5th or lower. Their saving grace this year is their bassline and timpani. Man, can they play! But a percussion feature right off the bat with little to no melody is a terrible way to feature your most improved section, and the whole show loses my interest for awhile (just like that damned muffler feature last year). Dante. Does the show follow his journey? I saw a dead girl, the girl dancing in the ballad and a guy lifting a girl at the end. But shouldn't there be something else? Where are the circles of Hell (besides in the drill)? Each circle has a very prominent theme and I don't see it.  Body movement. They do it at strange parts of the show. They do that tarp-over-the-corps thing, but then don't do anything on the other side. Didn't we just enter Hell? Be evil! And then they're playing evil-sounding music...while doing a jig? This theme should be easy! Look at what Cadets did for Between Angels and Demons, or Phantom with Faust. There's some easy stuff to translate the Hell theme through body movement on the field, and I don't feel like Crown achieves it as well as they could.    Overall, it's pretty good. Easy to pick apart some things, but a solid show nonetheless. I'm guessing 4th or 5th, depending on how well Bluecoats and SCV clean up this month."
drumcorps,3cmc26,asdf072,2,Thu Jul 9 19:20:53 2015 UTC,Their pit is definitely better but FAR from where they need to be.
drumcorps,3cmc26,BrainGoesPop,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:04:26 2015 UTC,"It's because they still have WGI people writing for them. Nunez is amazing at arranging, but they need someone strong in composition. At least I'm not confusing their book with an exercise this year."
drumcorps,3cmc26,IrishTrumpeter,-1,Thu Jul 9 15:30:35 2015 UTC,"Crown's brass has rejoined the mortals. Definitely no 20.0 brass score this year. I guess it balances out, now that their drums are getting into shape."
