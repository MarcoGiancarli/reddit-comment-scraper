Vegetarianism,3e3q7y,sumpuran,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:58:35 2015 UTC,"VegNews is pretty awesome and has great articles and recipes, and PETA often has great informational resources, like this infographic.  This Vegetarian Starter Kit is also really helpful, and explains a lot about veggie health."
Vegetarianism,3dyv8f,idknickyp,18,Mon Jul 20 17:28:00 2015 UTC,"You are not compromising by feeding your cat meat. She needs it, you don't. It is the fact that you don't need it that makes a vegetarian diet right for you, but it will never be right for your cat. If it makes you feel better, remember that a lot of the meat that goes into cat food is byproduct, so your patronage probably has minimal impact on the demand for meat."
Vegetarianism,3dyv8f,BlitheCynic,9,Mon Jul 20 18:11:39 2015 UTC,"I use taste of the wild. They don't animal test their products. You can't impose your ethics on an animal that does not live according to such - all you can do here is be a wise consumer and contribute to the least amount of suffering possible. (I'm vegan, I know the struggle.)"
Vegetarianism,3dyv8f,greeneggsnhammy,2,Mon Jul 20 18:11:45 2015 UTC,There's a list of companies that don't test their pet food on animals: http://www.peta.org.uk/living/non-animal-tested-companion-animal-food/
Vegetarianism,3dyv8f,quirkyowl,7,Mon Jul 20 21:29:18 2015 UTC,"Personally, I feed my cats commercial dry cat food, usually salmon or other fish. Cats diets are pretty picky so I'd rather have healthy cats then potentially hurt them. I also subscribe to Colleen Patrick-goudreau's viewpoint (always have since I went vegetarian).  Here is a video she made on the topic, which I think does a good job explaining dietary needs and her opinion.   http://youtu.be/5wEVB5V2nfA"
Vegetarianism,3dyv8f,redheadedk8,4,Mon Jul 20 17:49:37 2015 UTC,"Cats (all pets realistically) operate on instinct.  Humans are the only species given the abilities to apply cognitive reasoning to what our actions are and the affect on surrounding beings relating to dietary choices.  So following a specific diet, for health or for other reasons, is something only humans are capable of.  Extrapolated, if all humans ate and operated in a vegan fashion, regardless of reason, then there would be a much greater balance in terms of consumption, pollution, animal suffering, and the like.    As humans it's a great choice to make, but it is a choice.  Pets don't have the ability to make that choice independently, and more so, they don't have the cognitive ability to understand the reasoning behind that type of decision that's being made for them.  So in my opinion, if there's better quality food, something created in a manner in fashion that tries to minimize environmental impact and animal suffering, then that's a positive choice to make, but deciding for our pets that they should eat or not eat things that aren't natural for their species, isn't the best idea.  To a degree, forcing our pets to eat something they don't naturally eat or wouldn't naturally eat is reverse of the principles that we're basing the decision on in the first place.  As pet owners, part of our job is to give our pets a happy, healthy home.  Our pets would do things that would hurt or injure themselves significantly if we didn't intervene, including with things they try to eat.  Preventing them from eating things like household cleaners isn't the same thing as excluding certain things they instinctively want/need to eat.   That's the separation I make for my pets.  I pay more for quality food that focuses on a whole diet that we scientifically know is good for pets.  It has whole ingredients and easily identifiable contents, so less chemicals and unnecessary contents, and thus a better diet for them.  Since it's whole ingredients, there's less filler, and theoretically less of an animal impact overall.  It's certainly double what I would pay for normal pet food, but it's a step in the right direction.  It's not feasible to feed my pets exclusively a salad diet, due to the unknown affect on their health and the fact that they don't get a choice in the matter.  Again these are just my opinion and I wouldn't expect to force that type of thinking on anyone here."
Vegetarianism,3dyv8f,ciabattabing16,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:23:01 2015 UTC,"Reconcile what? That your kitty need flesh and you don't?   I guess a lot depends on why you're changing your diet. If it's because of your health, think of your kitty's health - they rely on animal protein to function.   If it's because of some social stigma you perceive about eating animals - and you can't continue to feed the cat what she needs to be healthy, you might want to consider re-homing her. If it's because of the treatment of animals in commercial farming situations, find a source for sustainable or organic food from reputable sellers. I use a couple of brands of grain free foods for my boys (I have two of them) that I get at tractor supply of all places.. not cheap but without all the grain fillers in the food, the boys eat less."

Vegetarianism,3duf2g,vorpalbladerunner,2,Sun Jul 19 18:49:57 2015 UTC,"Add noodles, veggies, shredded cheese, & cream cheese. The cream cheese is a great addition for our family lasagna since my hubby doesn't like ricotta!"
Vegetarianism,3duf2g,tstdmffn,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:47:01 2015 UTC,"2 medium onions diced, in a medium heat skillet with oil until just translucent. If you don't think you have to many onions when you start, add more. This is the flavor base. Now add the package of EXTRA FIRM tofu that you drained/squeezed/wrung out while the onions were cooking. You also completely crumbled the tofu by slicing into 1"" think slabs and crushing those with a fork. Brown this tofu adding a tablespoon of oil here and there to keep it from sticking. Whole process takes about 25 minutes of cooking. This is my basic ""ground tofu"". If you add chilli powder, cumin, etc you have taco stuffing. Now I add a jar of red sauce from the store, or make one if  you are dedicated. Don't cheap out here, go to Whole Foods or something and get some Muir Glen fire roasted tomato that has extra zing. Cook the red sauce into the tofu for 10-15 minutes and use that mixture to make lasagna. Will be good. I also like to use the no cook lasagne pasta. It absorbs liquids in the lasagna so it doesn't come out runny, esp if there are veggies involved. I prefer firm, non runny lasagna."
Vegetarianism,3duf2g,geauxvegan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:21:59 2015 UTC,"extra firm tofu, put it in a colander with a towel over it and a bowl full of something heavy. Leave it 15-20 minutes, then freeze it and do the process again. Gets it really textury, and is awesome if the stores near you don't stock tvp/seitan."

Vegetarianism,3duf2g,biscuits_please,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:49:14 2015 UTC,Long story short. Sautee the veggies a tiny bit (use what you like).  And you can do a cream or red sauce.  Top layer must be cheese.  Enjoy.
Vegetarianism,3duf2g,GujuGanjaGirl,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:01:50 2015 UTC,"The other recipes here sound good, or you can do some googling and find one you like.  My advice is don't boil the noodles, and don't bother with the 'no boil' noodles either.  Use regular noodles.  If you make sure to use enough sauce and cover the whole pan tight with foil for the first 45 minutes in the oven, you can make great lasagna with regular noodles, no boiling required. The noodles will cook in the sauce."
Vegetarianism,3dpsrs,Sunclouds42,25,Sat Jul 18 07:10:19 2015 UTC,"I don't eat eggs or milk at home when I'm in control of food, but if I'm out somewhere and eating something I haven't prepared myself I don't worry about it. I do feel bad about it and will probably eventually end up vegan, but at the moment I'm still newly vegetarian and getting used to that first."
Vegetarianism,3dpsrs,FoxThisShit,6,Sat Jul 18 08:44:05 2015 UTC,"I'm the same. A lot of the time it's a toss-up between either eating something with dairy in it or not eating anything at all, so I still consider myself first and foremost, even though at home I'm more conscious of eating animal products and I try my best to avoid them"
Vegetarianism,3dpsrs,Tom_Anks,13,Sat Jul 18 16:17:33 2015 UTC,"I'll admit I'm really, really hooked on everything dairy: milk, butter, cheese, ice cream, yogurt—it's very difficult to imagine giving even one of those products up, even if it's ethically problematic. Sort of the way I imagine most intelligent, thoughtful meat-eaters feel about eating meat."
Vegetarianism,3dpsrs,coralya,8,Sat Jul 18 12:40:42 2015 UTC,"Ugh, I felt like this for ages! But I did eventually do it - I had a school trip to Italy which I used as a sort of final hurrah (oodles of pizza and cappuccinos and gelato and tiramisu...) and then I just stopped. And I'm surprisingly fine. I have soya/almond milk in my cappuccinos and baking, avocado where I might once have used cheese and olive oil for most butter situations. I do kind of not pry too much into what's in restaurant meals - I'm aware an awful lot of it probably contains butter. And I eat the occasional slice of birthday cake. But apart from that I've gone completely dairy free! The only thing I miss is yogurt, being half-Turkish. I'm working on slowly phasing eggs out but for now I will occasionally resort to one for a quick kick of protein."
Vegetarianism,3dpsrs,insinceregiraffe,2,Sat Jul 18 14:41:12 2015 UTC,"If you can be bothered making your own yoghurt, you can make it out of coconut cream. I'm going to attempt it but it looks like a lot of trial and error, plus it works out more expensive than regular yoghurt. But I can't live without yoghurt, so if I want to go dairy free I'm gonna need to sort something out, haha."
Vegetarianism,3dpsrs,FoxThisShit,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:51:25 2015 UTC,"This sounds great! I can definitely be bothered - I've made almond milk a few times, and my grandma makes her own regular yogurt which I've always found really cool."
Vegetarianism,3dpsrs,insinceregiraffe,9,Mon Jul 20 08:59:34 2015 UTC,I pretty much just eat them when they are in things. I would like to go full vegan one day but right now I live in a small town in Kansas where I already can't eat at about half of the restaurants.  That being said in about a month I am moving to Wichita and I think it would be easier there.
Vegetarianism,3dpsrs,sutwilso,2,Sat Jul 18 13:04:12 2015 UTC,It's not much easier here from what I've experienced. Unless I'm just not able to find the right places.
Vegetarianism,3dpsrs,Clearlypro,7,Sun Jul 19 05:02:10 2015 UTC,"Right now, there are no dairy products in my house. The only eggs in my home are from my friend's chickens, and I cook them up for my pet (baby) rats.  At home, I tend to eat vegan. Outside of home, I don't complain about eggs or dairy being in something that I am served.   I guess you could say that I feel neutral about it. This is how I've been eating for 18+ years, I don't give it much thought any more."
Vegetarianism,3dpsrs,RogueVenus,7,Sat Jul 18 15:13:14 2015 UTC,"I eat eggs and cheese. My dairy is really minimal in particular, but my eggs are high. I wouldn't say I consume more than non-vegetarian friends, though the gym is a regular for me and eggs are a simple source of the protein I need. There are times when I do feel bad, but I know that this is where I need to be right now. I think regularly of Vegucated, and how vegetarianism/veganism is not a religion, and you should not feel bad if you are soing what is right for you (in the context of the veg-vegan continuum)."

Vegetarianism,3dpsrs,yourlycantbsrs,6,Sat Jul 18 14:24:14 2015 UTC,"It can be very hard to kick dairy and eggs- it was for me, but I did it! They're very addictive. I think it's important to remember to be respectful though, too, of people's journeys."
Vegetarianism,3dpsrs,bobbi_joy,6,Sat Jul 18 20:09:00 2015 UTC,"I cook vegan about 80% of the time at home and about 25% of the time going out. I usually try not to order things with cheese but it's tough to avoid butter, I think. For example, most Indian restaurants use ghee and I absolutely love Indian food. Many veggie burgers are made using eggs. Stuff like that. I never buy milk or eggs for home, but sometimes my fiancé and I will purchase some fancy cheese as a treat.   I feel bad about it sometimes, but I think that every bit makes a difference. By being flexible, I'm hoping to show others (like friends and family) that being vegetarian isn't too difficult. I also am aware that I can't find anything good at several restaurants and I wouldn't want to be overly picky and further inconvenience anyone."
Vegetarianism,3dpsrs,spodek,8,Sat Jul 18 16:18:03 2015 UTC,"I don't eat meat. I'll have cheese occasionally and very rarely I'll eat a food with egg as a minor ingredient, like a couple times a year.  I find I eat less animal products than most people I've talked to who call themselves vegan. I don't understand why they call themselves vegan if they eat fish or dairy, no matter how infrequently. I eat a lot less animal products than any omnivore I know.  How do I feel? Eating cheese reminds me of the year I lived in Paris when I was younger. I like the memories."

Vegetarianism,3dpsrs,Frederickanne,6,Sat Jul 18 19:56:39 2015 UTC,"Eggs, cheese, honey, and mass produced white sugar are all part of my weekly diet. Cheese is part of at least one meal a day. Eggs are part of one or two meals a week, sometimes more.  Cheese is so prominent because it is my indulgence. I find that in most parts of life, having a ""cheat"" enabled following the rules easier.  I feel good about my decisions. I'm doing way better at eating ethically than I did 20 years ago, better than even 10 years ago, and continual to make small improvements every year. Comparisons to other folks are unimportant to me."
Vegetarianism,3dpsrs,PaddyPony,4,Sat Jul 18 16:40:06 2015 UTC,"People might think this sounds crazy but I see eggs/milk as being more 'cruel' than meat. To me you kill something and it's dead and that's awful but to keep something alive and force it to lay in those conditions/be constantly impregnanted and milked, is far worse than a quick death.  My parents have about 15 chickens on their property and I get eggs from them because those little princesses are fed hot porridge in winter and are doing just fine, but a lot of people try and give me shit for it like oh you eat eggs at home in secret but not if we go out somewhere. They can't seem to differentiate that the eggs I eat at home are sourced from my own chickens and frankly a lovely little cruelty free loop hole because eggs are delicious."
Vegetarianism,3dpsrs,Elliotrosemary,4,Sat Jul 18 20:26:20 2015 UTC,Only if they are in something. i don't drink milk and I avoid dairy products. I actually can't eat eggs straight because they cause severe stomach distress. When they are baked in something it's OK.

Egg consumption varies pretty significantly. I like quiches, so sometimes I'll have a ton of eggs. Other days I don't have any.  I don't know that I eat more or less than my non-veg friends, and feel neutral about it."

I feel the same about other drinks like soda so that's not really a veg/vegan thing. I try to eat an egg a day for their nutritional value, and I eat cheese when it's a part of a recipe. Not sure if I eat more or less than my non-veg friends. I could eat vegan at home, but I think eating out or with friends and family would become nearly impossible, as finding vegetarian options is hard enough."

Vegetarianism,3dpsrs,schectersix,2,Sat Jul 18 14:22:05 2015 UTC,"Personally, I find that mostly eat less dairy than my friends. I don't drink fluid milk, although I do use it in cooking. My use of cheese is generally limited, and I almost never eat ice cream. I do eat active culture yogurt a few times a week. Mostly, I eat eggs - tons on them. I have them for breakfast on most days and bake with them regularly, so that's probably a higher use than most people have. I make a point of sourcing them locally from true free range chickens."

I really like it and the health benefits of it and for some reason I don't feel bad about it, though I probably should. Partly because without the honey industry it's likely that bees would go extinct and we'd all be fucked, or am I wrong about that? If anyone has some good arguments to change my view that'd be good.  Edit:sorry went kinda off topic there, to answer you op, when I was a vegetarian I drank milk and ate only free range eggs and vegetarian cheese with no animal rennet. Still felt kinda weird doing it but didn't think it was wrong until I found out how awful the milk industry is. I still wouldn't be morally against someone owning chickens if they have a large area to roam and are treated well I don't think it's unethical to do so but I can't eat eggs since going vegan because it just feels wrong."

I usually just stick to the sides and the salad whenever I have dinner with them, and it usually isn't an issue. My grandma will often buy some kind of veggie burger or something like that for me. You can also just always offer to bring a side dish just to ensure there is something that you can and want to eat there.   Just be prepared for a lot of mocking. I hate it. I cannot have a meal with them without some sly comment by my grandpa or one of my uncles. It's really infuriating and I am closer to making a scene every time.

My reason for being vegetarian is for moral reasons. I was just served rice and beans containing chicken broth as a substitute for chicken fajitas........ I said no thank you and indulged in the veggies and tortilla shells. I did feel really bad but if I don't make my intentions known, there will be chicken broth in every dish. Even if there is, I will sit there with an empty plate and suffer. I remind myself my reasons and am very strict. I'm always as polite as I can be and shrug off any discontentment.   I attended a lasagna dinner once and only ate garlic bread. It's even harder with kids bc I don't want my kids to eat meat... but I give them meat if I have to (like with lasagna).  There's typically something I can eat though... Even pouring myself a glass of water will help me get through the dinner. I am questioned all the time, insulted and offended... You can always eat a little beforehand if you know there will only be a large platter of meat lasagna."
Vegetarianism,3cp53j,Kittenkajira,0,Sat Jul 11 15:39:50 2015 UTC,"I think it's courteous to eat from what's available when someone else has cooked.  Most of the time you can just not eat the meat dish.  If it means you only get some potatoes or salad, then so be it.  If it's a casserole or something and the meat's all mixed in, I either just suck it up and eat it or pick out the meat.  I wouldn't even bring it up, and they might not even notice.  It's alright if you slip up and eat some meat."
Vegetarianism,3cp53j,gh0stfl0wers,2,Fri Jul 10 05:49:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah I definitely wouldn't suck it up and eat it if it's a casserole. Obviously that's a personal choice and to each their own. I usually either stick to any salad they might have, or bring some kind of side myself if I am not sure what will be served. If you're hosting a dinner party I think it's appropriate to ask your guests in advance if they have any dietary restrictions so you can find something that the majority will be able to eat. This is an easy way to prevent awkward situations.   Edit: usually if I am invited for dinner somewhere and the host is not aware of my diet already, I just tell them. But I make sure to stress that I don't want them to go out of their way to accommodate me and then offer to bring something. It helps that I am not a picky eater otherwise, so there really aren't any vegetarian options that I would turn down."

Vegetarianism,3cja10,pixiedonut,3,Wed Jul 8 16:56:19 2015 UTC,"You definitely mean ""appeal to nature."" AFAIK the naturalistic fallacy isn't a logical fallacy per se — it's a term Moore used to refer to certain ways of defining the concept of ""good."" In Moore's thinking, ""good"" can't be defined except by itself, and to attempt to define ""good"" in terms of other observable qualities is fallacious.  An ""appeal to nature,"" on the other hand, is claiming that something is good because it's natural (which coincidentally is also an example of Moore's naturalistic fallacy)."
Vegetarianism,3cja10,PaintItPurple,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:39:43 2015 UTC,"So is the ""naturalistic fallacy"" just a broader statement on how we should and shouldn't define ""good""? And the appeal to nature is one type of that fallacy?"
Vegetarianism,3cja10,davy_crockett,2,Wed Jul 8 18:44:15 2015 UTC,"Yes. Basically, the naturalistic fallacy is defining ""good"" as anything other than just ""good.""

Moore's argument is that goodness is an inherent moral property that things have, and it does not derive from anything we can observe."
Vegetarianism,3cja10,PaintItPurple,2,Wed Jul 8 19:28:15 2015 UTC,"Naturalistic fallacy:       In philosophical ethics, the term ""naturalistic fallacy"" was introduced by British philosopher G. E. Moore in his 1903 book Principia Ethica.  Moore argues it would be fallacious to explain that which is good reductively in terms of natural properties such as ""pleasant"" or ""desirable"".  Moore's naturalistic fallacy is closely related to the is–ought problem, which comes from Hume's Treatise. However, unlike Hume's view of the is–ought problem, Moore (and other proponents of ethical non-naturalism) did not consider the naturalistic fallacy to be at odds with moral realism.  The naturalistic fallacy should not be confused with a fallacious appeal to nature, a mistaken claim that something is good or right because it is natural (or bad or wrong because it is unnatural).

Vegetarianism,3cja10,pixiedonut,17,Thu Jul 9 12:57:44 2015 UTC,"Not a very rigorous argument.   Its not about being veggy or non-veggy. Its about atoms eating atoms. Thats it. That’s the end of it. A group of atoms can choose not to eat another, but in the end they’re all just atoms.   What does that even mean? You could apply that over-reductionist logic to any situation to make it meaningless. For example: should one person punch another in the face? It's just one bunch of atoms colliding into another bunch of atoms. That's the end of it.  I'm not going to address every point, but there are very few animals that count as ""micro-organisms."" Vegans and vegetarians care about killing animals, because animals have a real capacity to suffer, while plants, bacteria, etc. do not. Even if the suffering and death of non-animal life mattered, you would still be causing less suffering and death by avoiding killing animals.   You also seem to be mixing up vegetarian and vegan. I know there are a lot of interpretations of these terms, but if you look at the sidebar, vegan means no animal products and vegetarian means no animal products requiring the death of the animal. So eggs are vegetarian but not vegan.  Finally, B12 really isn't that hard to get as a vegan."
Vegetarianism,3cja10,davy_crockett,2,Wed Jul 8 14:06:13 2015 UTC,"""For the ones stuck in the moral dilemma of killing animals, I open their minds to the concept of micro-organisms. We consume millions of teeny-tiny micro-organisms everytime we eat, breathe, sleep, walk or stay still. Despite being vegetarians and sparing the lives of hundreds of chickens, we’re still killing billions of tiny organisms of life. Can’t hear their screams – as our ears aren’t tuned to that micro-frequency (Thank God!).""  When I read this I started to feel bad for the poor guy who wrote this. To my defense for killing micro-organisms - I wouldn't kill them if I could choose not to. Unfortunatelly, I can't do that. Although, I can chose not to kill what I don't have to kill, which are cows, pigs, birds and other bigger animals."
Vegetarianism,3cja10,itrytowrite1,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:56:06 2015 UTC,"Sanchit bhai. I think what these guys are trying to say is the issue is not if it's cool to kill animals and eat them. It's about how the meat people readily eat and want more of is coming at a cost that is too grave from an ethical standpoint. I encourage you to read this: http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/29/farmageddon-cost-cheap-meat-lymbery-review  This is the price of meat in the modern western world. It's not like the good old days where animals were treated with dignity, which might still be the case in our mother land, where meat consumption is limited to 20-25% of the population. In the western world the demand for meat is readily rising, and thus corporations who have to deliver the product every quarter, do what they do best to optimize the dignity out of the equation. It's quite sad, so if I can't do anything about it, at least I wont contribute to it. Don't wan't none of dat bad karma."

Vegetarianism,3byvll,RaveninaBottle,16,Fri Jul 3 07:27:15 2015 UTC,"I have been a vegetarian for ~10 years. I am also a field geologist who works in rural parts of central asia for months at a time. While in the field, I tend to be quite flexible in regards to remaining a vegetarian. Sometimes this borders on survival, vegetarianism isn't really a thing in this part of the world (at least out in the countryside, big cities are fine) so quite often the choices for food are mutton, mutton, or mutton. In theory, it's possible, though not particularly healthy (I could likely just eat bread for the 2 months, but I have a feeling that wouldn't end well), for me to mostly avoid eating meat, but the bigger thing is often not insulting hosts. Very often I am staying in the homes of incredibly poor people who I am paying (a very modest sum by my standards, but a decent amount of money for them) for room and board. If someone living in a mud brick shack in the middle of nowhere who has very few possessions of value and one of those is their sheep and they slaughter a sheep just for you and your companions because you are their guest, it is, in my opinion and theirs, incredibly rude and offensive to not at least eat some of what they have offered you. Does it make me feel sick? Yes. Do I enjoy eating all parts of a sheep? Hell no (I think most vegetarians develop some aversion to meat, which is acute enough when it's a steak or a hamburger, try getting a plate full of liver, brain, fat and tongue).

It makes me a pariah amongst most other vegetarians (and for the few years I was also vegan, I was yelled at a lot and, for lack of a better term, bullied, which just made me look into evolutionary biology and meta-ethics to argue back (not something I'm proud of).   So I eat flesh maybe twice a year, for extremely special occasions. This year, I ate fish for the first time in years on Father's Day, as I hadn't seen my father in some time, and he always raves about the restaurant we went to and their seafood.  Similarly, later this year I will travel to the deep south of the US, and visit my mother and her family. They are farmers and outdoorsmen, and though we disagree politically and socially on a lot of issues, I will go hunting with them. It's about the only time I can speak to them as an equal or learn something from them. I have used bows, I have used snare traps, and I have used firearms to do this. For my not-very-well-off relatives, it's a matter of saving critical amounts of money.   More venison will keep the family fed for months, and while I only eat a slice of meat from the animal I've hunted once and can go back to a larger city where I can buy reasonably priced, healthier vegetarian foods, my family cannot. For this reason, I always eat a small amount of any game I've hunted, and leave the rest with family or someone who will fully use it (organs, muscles, even the skin/hide).

I'm lost in the Amazon rainforest.  A native tribe rescues me.  They offer me food, but they make it very clear that refusing it is an insult punishable by torture.      ... or any other improvable and ridiculous scenario.

It's the concept that it's not OK to buy and eat meat or animal products, but it is OK if those foods would have been wasted or thrown away anyway. That way, you are not contributing to more of those products being produced and more animals being harmed.  I think it makes a lot of sense if you're willing to do a little dumpster diving."

I like using this app called Yummly. The app has tonnes of recipes, but what I like about it the most is that it has the nutritional value of every meal.

Vegetarianism,3bn0ts,increasingvalency,27,Tue Jun 30 15:11:37 2015 UTC,"ALL. THE. TIME.   I am actually really fed up with it and I also dread the 4th of July. I am so sick of being around meals focusing on meat. I'm sick of people asking stupid questions like the normal, ""Why not? It's just chicken. It's just chicken broth. Can't you just pick it off? I only put a little bit in...""   I feel like such an outcast and I can't even comprehend why people don't show ANY sympathy towards my reasonings for being a vegetarian. They go straight to ""But it tastes so good... Who cares."" They don't even try to understand. I cannot handle it lately. I don't want to eat with anyone but my immediate family because I've been so upset this past week. I think it's because I've hosted way too many cookouts this past month. All hot dogs... along with veggie dogs for my children and I. People make comments, ""That belongs in the garbage"" etc. ""Give your baby the real stuff... You are depriving him."" ""Your daughter's gonna get mocked in school. That poor girl."" ""You deprive your husband.. He needs extra meat today.""   IT PISSES ME OFF. Can you sense my frustration? I want to leave my home and find a vegan community to live with. Seriously. I still eat eggs and limited dairy, but if I had an excellent support system, I'd give it all up.   We actually have a dozen chickens that we got to have non-commercial/factory farm eggs and for companions/pets. We have sheep for pets too. These animals are full of personality. I was telling my MIL that I wanted to get harnesses for my chickens so I could take them on walks and she instantly said, ""You know they have a pea sized brain right?"" My response was... ""They learn... They can do tricks and understand simple commands or motions with training... Even without."" When it's bedtime, they all know exactly where their coop is.. And they follow me when I'm outside... The point is that I LOVE MY CHICKENS and all animals, so any ignorance and disrespect towards my vegetarianism is unacceptable. I've had enough..   :( Sorry for the rant. But seriously, I have no other method of getting my frustrations out."

My friend just got some chickens, and it looks like the experience is going to turn her daughters into a couple of little vegetarians!  She has a big garden, and now chickens, so she bought a bunch of books on vegetables and raising animals. Her older child has been reading the books and absolutely lost her shit at the chapter about slaughtering chickens. She doesn't want her pets to be killed. And then the made the connection that the chicken at the store used to be just like her pets... I have to smile when she tells me these stories."
Vegetarianism,3bn0ts,RogueVenus,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:12:31 2015 UTC,That's great! I also wanted to have chickens so my daughter can make the meat connection. She loves her chickens dearly and refuses to eat chicken. She's 3 and tells ppl they are naughty if they eat chicken.

He was working on some pork when he felt his arm tighten up from wrist to past the elbow.. he looked down to see a hook/tape (memory fails me) coiling up his arm. Apparently he quit soon afterward.

Vegetarianism,3bn0ts,RogueVenus,11,Wed Jul 1 13:10:14 2015 UTC,"Not in a long time. I've actually had people tell me that they never even noticed that I am a vegetarian.   In general, if I'm going somewhere that I know other people will be chowing down (barbecue, family dinner) I volunteer to bring something, and then bring something that I'll be happy to eat. When going out, I always suggest a place that I know will accommodate me.   I don't really get to worked up about what other folks are eating, and if someone offers me meat, I just tell them ""no thank you,"" without any explanation.  When it comes up in conversation, people will often say, ""I had no idea!""   I'm moving more and more toward a plant-based diet as I get older, and I am SO happy to talk to people about it when they ask. But I figure that if someone else hasn't opened that door, I'm not going to try to break it down and preach to someone who doesn't care to hear it. Just causes me more headaches than it's worth."
Vegetarianism,3bn0ts,mommyandlove,4,Tue Jun 30 21:08:22 2015 UTC,It's unavoidable for me to go unnoticed. Because typically everything served has some form of meat in it.

That said, I also have a policy of trusting the cook — if they say something's vegetarian, then I eat it, even if I suspect they may not quite understand and may have used lard or broth or gelatin, I eat it and try not to create a fuss.

In many parts of the US, ""meat"" is taken to mean ""beef"". Anything else - cow organs, pork, chicken, fish and seafood are all seen as somehow separate from ""meat"".

Only buying fair trade tea, coffee, and chocolate from reputable distributors and manufacturers.  And so on.  But when I'm going to a friend's house or to a family gathering, my long list of ethical eating habits are too complicated. Most people can understand and honor, “Nothing which required an animal to die, which includes meat, broth, gelatin, and rennet.”  I ate meat for more than 25 years, so my current policy is a distinct improvement which balances my impact with practical limitations.  Here is a list of cheese made without animal rennet I have no trouble finding the cheeses I want in my area, and I think some of the brands on the list are fairly widely distributed in the U.S. at least (e.g., Land O'Lakes and Sargento).

Vegetarianism,3bkasq,vtoska,2,Tue Jun 30 04:03:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Sometimes, I read things like ""pork gravy"" and the ingredients list doesn't actually have meat additives, it's... just stuff meant to be used for pork steaks."
Vegetarianism,3bkasq,HogarthS,6,Fri Jul 3 07:21:43 2015 UTC,"If you don't feel like you can trust her to leave broth out of certain dishes you might start bringing some sides of your own, either something you've cooked or picked up from the store.  You can say that you just want to contribute to the meal and if she is suspicious be honest and say you just want to be sure that it's meat free because it's important to you.  There are some things I let slide like my dad saying he'll keep my stuff separate on the BBQ only to find out he cooks it all together and some things I would not be OK with such as using ingredients they know I don't eat (which thankfully they don't).  Good luck and hope you can find middle ground.  Keeping the peace with in-laws can be tricky!"

If the answer is yes, then I can't eat it. Broth, gelatin, etc, all require the animal to be killed first. Milk, honey, etc, doesn't require the animal to die.  Now, all of us here KNOW it's slightly more complicated than that, depending on your particular diet and also specific animal products, but it's a good way, I've found, to get the general gist of what is and isn't okay for me to eat to non-veg'ns."

They don't consider chicken meat is all I can take away from it. As a note here, when I did eat meat, I did consider chicken to be in that category."

I mean it's true less animals were killed, but not because less people are eating less meat, at least not by absolute numbers. The reduction in animals killed comes almost solely from the chicken industry, because they have seriously increased the average size of the chicken. While the numbers of slaughtered chickens went down (by almost 400 million), the total weight of poultry produced actually increased.  Sucks, but that's the stats :("

Dialysis patients don't have working kidneys so they constantly have to keep a close eye on their potassium intake. Go talk to a nutritionist for dietary recommendations especially when you have a medical condition. Please don't rely too much on reddit for something this serious.

Vegetarianism,37ad90,Wicksteed,5,Wed May 27 02:33:46 2015 UTC,"I would ask why they believe these things. It's all just speculation until they show why they think eating animal products causes as much death and suffering as veganism does. It's pretty common knowledge that raising animals is a far less efficient use of land and resources than using land for growing vegetables.  The second argument is like the difference between accidentally killing civilians in war and terrorism. There is a difference between accidental indirect killing which you aren't sure how to avoid and which is difficult to avoid and deliberately murdering someone. I think there's a huge moral difference between a soldier who accidentally kills a civilian and a terrorist who purposefully kidnaps, imprisons in a small enclosure, and kills a civilian. Killing animals is deliberate murder. Buying home decor is not. When you pay for animal products you are, with full awareness, knowingly killing animals on purpose.     Contrast that with buying a home that is 30% smaller because of animal welfare concerns. How the hell are you supposed to know how many animals that really saves, if any? It's too hard to know whether these other actions harm animals and to what extent. Like if buying $100 worth of decor harms animals but it's only 1 millionth of the harm caused by $100 worth of meat or eggs then these two actions are of course completely different and so it would be a wrong argument to use against vegans. But the reality is that it's impossible to spend the necessary amounts of time figuring out which of your daily actions cause harm to animals and people and which don't. On the other hand, refraining from directly murdering animals very obviously reduces animal suffering in a big way. There are 9 billion farm animals directly killed each year in the US alone. And it's not difficult either compared to living an ascetic lifestyle with no luxuries at all. Meaning this same very immoral argument could have been used throughout history in the context of all other great historical moral failings ie slavery, the holocaust, feudalism, etc. A slavery supporter could've said the same thing, could've just shrugged and pointed his finger - ""you claim to be against slavery because you care about helping people but you only donate 1% of income to charity while I donate 5%, that discredits your argument. We all get to choose how to do our part to help people."" But in reality, if people were just, everyone would just stop doing things which inflict very obvious, certain suffering on others --such as directly, purposefully murdering-- as opposed to justifying it by pointing fingers at one another for failing to live a Mother Theresa-like blameless existence."
Vegetarianism,37ad90,Wicksteed,2,Sun May 31 23:28:32 2015 UTC,"Thank you SO much for this well thought out response. I was stumped when they brought up these arguments. I love your rebuttal.. that carnivores are deliberately choosing to kill, while everything else is accidental. If everyone became vegan, we could focus more on other ways to prevent negative consequences of our daily lives. But for now, to stop doing harm intentionally is the real way to start solving animal welfare concerns.   I'm going to assume that these comments were made bc these people cannot imagine a life without eating meat (like many, MANY people have etched into their brains due to tradition). These two people embrace a ""homesteading"" type of lifestyle, who raise their own animals or buy meat and eggs from local farmers. It's a good start... But I have no desire to bring up the debate again. I blog about vegetarianism/veganism, but having real conversations is much more difficult when everyone in the room thinks you're the crazy one.  If you wouldn't mind, I'd love to hear your thoughts on an additional comment against vegetarianism.   What would we do with all the livestock if everyone became vegan? Would all the farm animals just become pets? That would still be detrimental to the environment.    My only thought is we wouldn't be repeatedly breeding them, which would reduce the numbers. This is a very common question I get asked."

Optimal ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fats of article  Ratio of fatty acids in different foods:       In 2001, researchers at a conference sponsored by the National Institutes of Health concluded that the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 should be consumed in a 1:1 ratio.  As of 2007, the Japanese government recommended a ratio of 4:1, while the Swedish government recommended a ratio of 5:1, and the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Science in the United States recommended a ratio of 10:1.   The rationale for the proposed ratios relates to the belief that the two classes of fat interact within the human body. Andrew Stoll, who advocates the consumption of the two fats in a 1:1 ratio, states, ""Once in the body, omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids follow parallel pathways, continually competing with each other for chemical conversion to various structures and molecules inside and outside the cells. Given this mechanism, it makes sense that the two fats might be required in approximately equal amounts.""  Susan Allport writes that ""While no one knows what the optimal ratio in the diet is for these two families of fats, the current (and recommended) ratio in Japan is associated with a very low incidence of heart and other diseases. A dietary ratio of 4:1 produces almost a 1:1 ratio of HUFAs in cell membranes.""   Present-day diets in the developed world have departed dramatically from this ratio. One estimate is that in developed countries, the ratio of Omega-6s to Omega-3s is closer to 15:1  Another estimate is that ""[t]he diet consumed by the typical American tends to contain 14 - 25 times more omega-6 fatty acids than omega-3 fatty acids.""

I add flaxseed to any nut butters I make to try and even things out.

Vegetarianism,35s9zw,DrunkBerserker,7,Wed May 13 02:12:54 2015 UTC,"A few questions to consider: how much and what kind of meat were you eating before, what are you replacing the meat with, and was the transition gradual? What's your daily caloric intake and protein intake like (for reference, I'm on ~1900 cal/day [for weight loss] and I average 50-60g protein a day; could be higher, but I am having no problem meeting macro levels and building muscle).  Here are a few ideas off the top of my head:   you're not getting enough calories, and/or your body is adjusting to the different nutrients you are getting you might be experiencing some sort of withdrawal from meat proteins, or an illness caused by a spike or deficiency in a certain vitamin(s) or mineral(s) your body cannot process the same amount of sugar and/or caffeine with assumedly lower amounts of fat and/or protein in your system   Your symptoms (weakness/fatigue, clamminess, being tired) sound like how I feel when my blood sugar is low (from not eating enough or going very long periods without eating), and also sound like symptoms of iron deficiency. I would make a food journal or use a food logging app, like MyFitnessPal to track the foods you're eating and note your caloric, protein, and vitamin/mineral intake to see what you might be missing."

If you have a normally (ie. not very) active lifestyle, you should be aiming for around 2000 kcal if you're a woman, 2400 if you're a man.  Did your caloric restriction start at the same time as switching to a vegetarian diet?  While I reckon what you've got is statistically more likely to be caused by a virus, such a low daily caloric intake would probably contribute to a lack of energy."
Vegetarianism,35s9zw,optimist_dreamer,1 point,Wed May 13 12:31:11 2015 UTC,"This is not accurate.  For many women 1500-1800 calories is healthy and 2000 is overeating.  Many doctors I have seen over the years have said 2000 is the average, and most women do not need that many calories unless they live a more active lifestyle.  Also I just learned from my endocrinologist that as many as 1 in 10 women have hormone irregularities that can cause insulin resistance and in general mess up the metabolic process."
Vegetarianism,35s9zw,rmeredit,2,Wed May 13 16:03:25 2015 UTC,"If we're talking statistics, and what you're saying is empirically true, it's equally true to say that 'for many women, 2200-2500 is healthy and 2000 is under eating.'  Likewise, 9 out of 10 women don't have these hormone irregularities that your're talking about.  The thing about averages and normal distributions is that unless you have good reason to believe you're an outlier, it's reasonable to assume you're somewhere close to that value, within one standard deviation or so.  1300 calories per day is quite low, and is more likely to have an effect on how someone feels in terms of energy and general wellbeing than simply switching to a meat free diet for a week.  Far more likely, though, is that OP has a viral infection."

Vegetarianism,34pm09,eatingalterego,8,Sun May 3 12:12:12 2015 UTC,"It depends on what you mean by ""gain weight."" If you are looking to put on muscle, you need to work out. Any healthy diet will do. Some people will tell you that you need to eat more protein, but that isn't necessarily true. Your current diet may have enough protein.   So, if it is healthy weight that you want to put on, you need to get a lot of exercise. Exercise will make you hungry. Eat healthy foods and you will put on weight.   You should also know that our ability to gain muscle is determined in part by genetics. It is just harder for some people. It doesn't mean that you can't do it, just that it takes more effort."
Vegetarianism,34pm09,english_major,12,Sun May 3 13:51:06 2015 UTC,"You just need to pay attention to calories. Plenty of vegetarian foods, like pasta, nuts, avocados, etc. are pretty high calorie and could help you gain weight. As for having the extra weight look healthy, just gain slowly and exercise more to build muscle. Myfitnesspal is a good tool to figure out how much you're eating and how much you should eat to gain weight."
Vegetarianism,34pm09,tzdk,-6,Sun May 3 12:22:32 2015 UTC,"It's not that simple actually. The way your body digest the carbohydrates depends on your microbiome (and how that food cooked or processed). OP's body probably is not that efficient in digesting those high calorie foods. I have a similar problem to OP's, and it's really hard to gain weight with even unhealthy sugary foods (I really have sympathy for people who have the opposite problem). You have to eat a LOT, even to function in the daily life, let alone gaining weight.   I agree with people who suggest exercising. I am thinking of taking up swimming to enhance my appetite. Even if it won't work, at least it is healthier to exercise than not.

I had a sore throat couple of days ago, and I ate/drank constantly to sooth the pain. Of course if I ate that way all the time, I would gain weight. It is just not very doable in real life.   Have you really read the article? For example, many of those high calorie nuts and seeds just leave your body only partially digested. It is basicly the way nature is. I see that you want to feel in control of your body. You can do it more efficiently if you know how it actually works. Dieting obsessively with a one track mind is not the real answer.

I wish they'd stop advertising vegetarian and veganism as weight loss diets.  The simple answer for you is to eat more.    But metabolism and other factors play a big part in weight.   Are you exercising?   Have you struggled to gain weight for a long time?  Have you has a medical check up to rule out medical reasons for difficulty gaining weight?
Vegetarianism,34pm09,funchy,3,Sun May 3 13:05:11 2015 UTC,"Zero exercising (I know, I suck). Struggled to gain weight forever. I have IBS so that might be the reason. The only recent related test I've had is one that proved I wasn't anemic. I'm not sure what else would be a possible cause."

When I moved in with him a year ago I began cooking for the two of us (he ate mostly microwave meals and fast food and it was common after meals he was sick) I eat a vegetarian diet and his thoughtwas I will eat whatcha cook. I made him what I normally eat, occasionally I buy organic meat for him. But what I focused on was trying to remove processed foods out of his diet. We arent perfect so not everything is organic, but I just read labels, avoid artificial ingredients(and there are non organic foods that will have simple non artificial ingredients) and he put on weight. He gained something like 30lbs and we have had to restock all his pants because he went from a 28 to a 32. He looks healthy, not fat. So I would suggest if you are doing veggie try to buy less/not processed if possible, it may help."

Another thing that really helps is drinking milk. Over here we have Jersey and Guernsey milk which has a very high fat content, much more than whole milk.

I was half-afraid she could read my mind and was either a) trolling me hardcore, or b) trying to change my mind. Neither of those were true, since I hadn't TOLD her, but man, it sure felt like it.  Anyway, so when that happened, I'd leave. Even if it was just to the backyard or a walk around the block. I'd just completely remove myself from temptation.  That might be a bit harder in an office environment, though. Maybe step outside for a moment, or walk to the bathrooms or something.   As for cravings, yes they're worse when you first start out. I don't really like to recommend the fake meat stuff--it's all overly-processed crap, which was part of what I was trying to avoid. However...it helps with the cravings. Morningstars BBQ Riblets and Gardein's Chipotle Lime Crispy Fingers saved me more times than I can count. I also would slice up some tofu, lightly bread it, fry it, and SMOTHER it in hot sauce. Healthy? Certainly not. But it was delicious, and quieted my buffalo wings craving."
Vegetarianism,34623v,lightswitch_raver,3,Tue Apr 28 16:39:30 2015 UTC,"Taking a walk helped a lot. I got to take time to just think about what I'm doing, and why I'm doing it, and what that smell really is - a hot carcass. Thankfully it was gone by the time I got back, and I'm feeling better about this, although still a bit nervous that that was just one of many challenges I'll be facing this week.   I'm definitely not a huge tofu fan, and don't love super-processed stuff, but I figure if fried chicken is salted/fatted/fried/smothered... it doesn't really matter what the subject of that process is. Tofu, seitan or other replacements will probably taste about the same, and be about as unhealthy. I mean the chicken nuggets in my freezer can't be any healthier. There's a wholefoods on my way home from work; I'm sure they'll have something for me.   Anyway, thank you so much for responding. It's also just nice to know that all vegetarians weren't born Mother Theresa, and that I'm not crazy for struggling so much. I wish it weren't so difficult to resist what should - and does - disgust me, but I guess because my association between meat on my plate and animals in my lap is so new, it's not totally solid yet. My first goal is 2 weeks (per a bet with my boyfriend), and then a month, and then the rest of 2015. It think I can, I think I can."

The smell of steak or Whopper (I know gross). I have been vegan for 2 years and that meat smell thing is totally gone. I cannot explain it but it just happened and I am like so over it. I know this doesn't help you right now but maybe it is some food for thought in the future. For now though in your moment of weakness, I guess I would just say baby steps.

I have never felt so good in terms of health prior.  In the beginning, yes, I did have temptations, especially from the smell, but as you go on your perception actually shifts in such a way that you find it physically uncomfortable to eat something like fried chicken because your body has gotten used to not having it; that is what you should be shooting for.  It's like eating foods on a daily basis that other people may find unsavoury, but you don't mind/like because you eat it so often, keep going at them veggie's and fruits and pretty soon you'll be wondering how at one point in your life you thought to yourself ""Man, I can't live without the fried chicken.""  Your stomach and sense of taste may protest now, but it will shift to accommodate your goals so as long you stay consistent for the next several weeks."

When a little time elapsed and I lose that conditioned desensitization to the sight and smell of animal parts, I stopped seeing them as food.  The leg of a dead bird looks no more appetizing to me than a box of spiders.   Now when I see chicken meat, my first thought is anatomy lab in college.  Or roadkill.  Or corpses.   None of those trigger the ""yummy food"" response in my mind.    So I think if you avoid being around it for a little while, that meat=food connection in your mind will fade.

I mean I think the real life-altering thought for me was realizing that given another few thousand years, other mammals might have evolved beyond homo sapiens, and then we'd be in feed lots. I know my cat is a smart ass. So when I see meat, part of me just thinks ""why is that pig leg any different from a human leg hanging there?"" and it kind of makes it very unappealing, in a way. I'm trying to listen to that part of me, and quiet the ""BAAAAACCCCOOONNN"" zombie part that has been much louder up to now. Cause I mean it's really just not worth sacrificing a life to me, anymore. I just have to keep remembering that that's what I'm doing - sacrificing another kind of life for my flippant taste preferences.

It took about 6 months for me to make the transition from meat at every meal to no meat at all.  First, I stopped eating any meat with bones or shape. So no drumsticks or chicken breasts, no steaks, no pork chops. But still eating hamburger, chicken nuggets, sausages, and ""hidden"" meat (broth, gelatin, etc.).  Once I felt that I had mastered that—a week without even thinking of buying something off of my ""no"" list—I extended the line to no meat except hamburger, fried fish sticks, and ""hidden"" meat.  Again, spent some time with that, and then when it felt easy, I cut out hamburger and then fish sticks.  Then, sometime later, I cut out all broths/stock from animal sources.  Then gelatin and non-vegetarian cheeses.  I still occasionally make exceptions for non-vegetarian cheeses and gelatin, especially when someone else has prepared the food and they haven't realized that not all cheese is equal, or what gelatin is (or where all it can be found!)."

Good veggie stock is hard to come by, and I have yet to find mushroom broth in this town. And everything at Panera is made with chicken broth :( But I don't eat Panera all the time, and they do have vegetarian options, and I'll just have to figure out how to make mushroom broth, I guess. At least I like to cook, and the idea of making stuff from scratch so that it doesn't contain flesh products isn't so daunting.   I'm definitely going to have to give veggie burgers a try.

Isn't a veggie sandwich with no meat the same price as a three meat sandwich from subway? It literally has less shit on it and cost the same price.
Vegetarianism,33i4ep,prodiver,6,Wed Apr 22 19:24:26 2015 UTC,"Yes, veggie sandwiches are the same price at Subway.  They used to be cheaper, though.  I remember 15 or so years ago a foot long veggie was 2.49, while most meat subs started at 3.49."

Vegetarianism,33i4ep,prodiver,20,Wed Apr 22 22:50:08 2015 UTC,"Supply and demand.  They buy meat by the ton, but only buy small amounts of eggplant/tofu.  This makes many less-common vegetables more expensive than meat."
Vegetarianism,33i4ep,prodiver,6,Wed Apr 22 18:41:20 2015 UTC,50 blocks of tofu on a consumer level is around $45. Its not a supply and demand thing when the cost for these items are already low. They are still buying more of these items than you and me so you can assume that whatever you might pay at the supermarket is more than what they pay. Their multiplier seems excessive.

I can buy a ton of chicken on alibaba.com for 60 cents per pound.  I can buy a ton of tofu for 55 cents per pound.  At bulk prices they are virtually the same cost for 1 ton, but buying 10x more chicken than tofu will make the chicken cheaper."

I don't know why people aren't turning to non-animal sources of protein more often. Health and environment aside (both important, don't get me wrong) the pocket book is how you make a difference most of the time.    And now that you point it out, yeah, when I do eat veggie out, those options are the same or more expensive than meat ones. Why should a lentil burger, whose ingredients cost less/# than meat be more expensive? (I'm talking non organic labeled stuff here). If I turn a lb of lentils into nice fat burgers all the ingredients are gonna end up costing me maybe $3-$5 and I'm gonna end up with probably 3# of food. A lb of ground beef is gonna end up being like 12 oz and will cost ya the same $3-$5. Ridiculous.   But I guess a lot of what you're paying for when you go out isn't the ingredients but the ""costs of running the business"" and they probably don't change much between veggie and non veggie items. I'm with you tho."

The current agricultural subsidies make the cost of raising animals for meat artificially low in the context of industrialized farming.

In other words, it was a luxury."

For those special occasions, the restaurant is usually mid- or high-end. I check the menu online and usually there is no or one veg entree. I call before making the reservation and ask nicely what they will do with a vegetarian. There's huge variation among restaurants, in terms of what ""the chef would be pleased to whip something up for you"" means. If I get a plate with what everyone else got as side dishes (I'm always the only vegetarian), they will never see me again. A lot of chefs take pains to make something special (I like to think they enjoy the challenge) and I talk their restaurants up every chance I get. I don't mind paying the same in those instances, if there's enough on my plate to constitute a meal/entree."

While vitamin B12 analogues may behave as vitamin B12 does in humans, it's probably wise to ensure optimal B12 status by including small amounts of vitamin B12-rich animal foods in your diet.  Or take a B12 supplement?! Not that hard.     then perhaps you can consider organic eggs from birds that are humanely treated as your source of animal-based nutrients.   So, which ones are that? The backyard ones because you happen to have a neighbor who swears they won't kill their hens (but probably will abandon them when their production slows or they get tired of taking care of them)? The ones whose brothers were still killed as chicks at the hatchery? B12 supplement, again, makes that all unnecessary.    If you can tolerate dairy products, you can also consider organic varieties, preferably those that are raw and from cows, goats, or sheep that are allowed to live in relative peace.   ""Live in relative peace""?! This person obviously doesn't know much about the dairy industry. Being impregnated yearly to have your child stolen and killed, then being killed when milk production slows after a few years is not ""living in peace"" at all. Seriously, just get a B12 supplement. It's a lot cheaper than all those humane washed animal products anyhow."

B12 is very important. Hence, why I keep saying take a supplement -- an oral one is fine for most people or an injection if you have digestive issues that prevent proper absorption. Personally, I am doing fine with an oral supplement. My levels are doing great after being vegan for years. And yes, many meat eaters are deficient and need supplements. I've known at least two people close to me who had B12 deficiency that was causing neurological problems. Both were frequent meat eaters, but are over 50 (and since absorption slows with age, pretty much all people over 50 are now recommended a B12 supplement).      http://www.veganhealth.org/articles/vitaminb12   But B12 deficiency is no reason to eat animal products, which is what the original article suggested. In fact, many lacto-ovo vegetarians still don't get enough from diet. The answer isn't to replace plant-foods in their diets with more animal products, it's to supplement. It's a small price to pay for avoiding much needless suffering and environmental damage."

You dice an onion, fry it in butter (more than you think you'll need), add 2 forks of flour (no idea why you have to use a fork, but w/e) and then stir it really well until the flour is a gold colour. Then add 1/2 a tube of tomato paste, a litre of water and spices (she used vegetable broth, pepper and Italian herbs). It's a very liquid sauce, so you can add it to gnocchi or pasta, put cheese on top and bake until the cheese melts. It doesn't taste as shitty as it might sound lol, it's actually pretty good.  You can also fry up any veggies, add canned tomatoes and some spices and eat it with rice/pasta/quinoa/couscous etc.  Or put potatoes and whatever vegetables you have (zucchini, eggplant, bell peppers and cherry tomatoes are good) into an oven-safe dish, add salt, pepper, olive oil and lemon juice and bake it.

My daughter is 5 and only last year started eating meat, and then she only eats it in small quantities. She has never liked beef, will eat chicken sparingly, but give her ham or bacon and she'll eat that right up.   From the day I started her on solid foods she showed a clear preference for vegetables and fruits over meats. She eats peas and carrots like candy, and might even choose a to have carrots in her lunch instead of strawberries. She just loves healthy food. We let her eat junk food but she almost always chooses the healthier option on her own. While other kids in her class are snacking on gummy bears and goldfish crackers, my kid's bringing real, actual food."

Vegetarianism,2yilu6,ericcris10sen,3,Tue Mar 10 02:38:20 2015 UTC,"It gets easier!  After a while your brain will just automatically filter out stuff without meat.  I recommend learning how to cook, or at least getting a good vegetarian cookbook.  At least then you'll gain familiarity with how to make a veggie dish, what types of ingredients you have to work with, and how to generally compose a dish.  I think the hardest part for a lot of people is the idea that they're omitting a large part of the meal, as most meals seem to be centered around a piece of meat.  If you try to make the same types of foods as before and just swap out the meat, you'll probably be not too happy with the result.  More successful vegetarian dishes stay away from this idea and are composed completely differently.  I recommend Isa Does It (which is a vegan cookbook).  It's full of easy and interesting dishes that play to the strengths of vegan food.  And there are a few homemade veggie burger recipes."

Tempura and tofu can be used as meat substitutes, but it takes some practice to get them tasting good.   As much as I am trying to get off of eggs, you can also make some very good egg dishes. Egg sandwiches was one of my favorites.   Also lots of junk food and chips are vegetarian, lol.   edit:  more easy stuff to cook:  instant potatoes, like the kind in bags (or just microwave a nominal potato)   pre-cooked Rice dishes, like old ben's, they take 90 secs to cook and have a wide variety   homemade chili, or canned vegetarian chili.

I've always been the type to cook meals that are yummy, vegetarian or not.  So you eat what I make, or you cook.  I firmly wanted that rule as a part of our household prior to having children, because I believe that picky eaters are made.  Luckily, he agrees.  Mostly I think he's happy to have someone putting meals in front of him every day.  We've both decided as a first step to stop eating meat as a main dish, and to eliminate dairy.  When we do eat meat, it's as an extra flavoring to a dish - like adding some ham to soup.  Maybe since he's stubborn about dropping meat, something like this could work in your household."

He does his thing and I do mine. I do cook meat for him because my office closed and I lost my job. Until I can contribute financially, I feel like the least I can do is contribute in our home. I went to culinary school before I stopped eating meat, and I know what tastes go well together so there's no issue with needing to taste anything.

Usually I don't cook meat for him as he tends to prefer lean game-y cuts of meat (kangaroo because we're in Australia) which tend to be very smelly and bloody, as far as meat goes.  I will occasionally cook him bacon, sausages, and heat up meat pies etc for him which I don't mind because none of these products are messy or difficult to cook.  There are some meals where the vegetarianised version is pretty much the only version that exists in the house now - lasagne and any type of Mexican food (because vego Mexican is the bomb and they both seem to like my Mexican cooking) come to mind."

From a sustainability point of view, if you're going to eat meat, then they're good choices if you're here in Australia because the theory is we have loads and loads of roos around the place destroying crops etc.  The state authorities cull the roos each year in most states so I figure if they're going to be killed they may as well be eaten rather than increasing the level of beef etc production.  Still it's horrible and gross really.  Pepperoni isn't too bad to handle, as far as meat goes.  I understand the frustration if you're expected to do all the cooking, especially.  My mum's way of dealing with that with teenage me was to say that it would be ok to be a vegetarian as long as I cooked my own food.  It just meant I grew up to be a pretty decent cook!"

He eats what I make, and sometimes I will add meat to whatever he is eating (if I make a pasta dish, for instance, I will add chicken for him) but generally he is quite fine with eating whatever vegetarian meal is on offer. He has a long and busy day, so he is too exhausted to cook his own food, and I'm not bothered by cooking meat with my food, so it works for us.  You have to find a compromise. We started with ""Meatless Monday"" and we still do that, even if Tuesday and Wednesday end up being meatless as well :) But when I make him lunch for work etc, and it's not leftovers, then I will get him meat for his sandwiches or I make him enchiladas with chicken, or burritos with minced meat or something like that.

I do get a little grossed out when he makes pork chops, but since he rarely cooks meat in the house (his own choosing), I feel I am pretty lucky and I don't complain.    I do not cook any meat for him or for our sons.  Our boys were semi-vegetarians from birth until they were old enough to choose meat for themselves (around age 10).  Our oldest loves meat but our youngest doesn't.  We explained to them why Dad likes meat and why Mom doesn't, and that they can make whatever choice they want.

Vegetarianism,2xuuw3,comfortablytrev,3,Wed Mar 4 05:14:48 2015 UTC,"I believe the actual definition of ""animal"" is an organism in the animalia kingdom, which is a branch on the tree of life. So by that reasoning, yes, it would be vegetarian. If you want to go by sentience, it would probably still be vegetarian as plants are just not set up for that. As was pointed out some vegetarians might still eschew since it would have to eat might, and you would indirectly be funding it. So I think technically it would be vegetarian but still ethically questionable."

I'd imagine the degree of separation would be enough to satisfy most people, but your post is causing me to question that assumption. I just looked at a bag of spinach in the fridge, and it didn't tell me whether animal or non-animal fertilizers were used."

Commercial egg replacer is just baking powder and a starch (cornstarch, tapioca starch, etc), and you can make it yourself for next to nothing. Baking soda and acid (vinegar, lemon juice) give a bit of body but no binding. Flax eggs, chia eggs and flax gel are superior in my opinion because they give body and binding without much additional flavor (no flavor from flax gel and no texture change).   Check out /r/veganrecipes for more info and inspiration"

The only catch - and this is a minor one - is that whole chia has a soft but seedy texture (but much softer, rounder, and inoffensive compared to raspberry for example).

Iron levels were never a problem for me while I was a vegetarian, but I know a couple folks (vegetarian or not) who have kicked 'em with the classic beans & greens, and cooking in a cast iron is supposedly helpful as well.  If you think about it, non vegetarians aren't necessarily eating a high iron diet either; a quick pop over to wolfram alpha shows that a serving size of ground beef only has about 13% of your daily required intake of iron, the same serving of kale has a comparable 8%. How popular are organ meats really?  I'm not suggesting you're a breaditarian, just that if you're already eating a diet with a decent amount of iron (beans & greens + cast iron cookware) perhaps your issue has to do with absorption rather than intake."

Also spiruline can also be good natural supplement. And to cut the tea for a while could be a good thing too, as someone said. This worked well for me and i am still fine now after all this time. You can try for a while and see afterwards how your blood levels are.  so my advice is to see with your doctor, of course, BUT above all, you have to learn to listen and trust your body... and this takes some time. if right now you feel you need to go for some meat, so be it. I actually have many friends around me that are not quite vegetarian, because sometime they feel the need for meat. one was like that for years,  and now she is vegan! So dont push more necessary pressure on yourself. We all had those moments in the first years where it was a bit experimental. Read as much as you can on the subject and try for yourself. follow what your body is asking you, not what you think you should eat to be a perfect vegetarian. Eating should be to do good to our body, not to put even more pressure on yourself (there is the rest of the world for that!!).  also, you should look into b12 defiency, it can be linked to anemia sometimes. we can never be too carefull with health!  good luck! hope you'll be better soon."

So my doctor told me that i should at least give it a try. i forced myself to eat meat (which was difficult, because i already saw meat as ""not something to eat"" at the time). fortunately, i got friends around me who oriented me towards the strategies people are already suggesting, and i tried. and now i am fine! and it been 7 years without meat!  as i am writing, i am remembering on of the best advice i learned about eating : it not only what you eat, but how you eat. and now it became an habit, i dont even think about it, but the principle is that to optimize digestion, one should begin with raw, then with cooked veggies and beans/lenses/tofu... and finish with cereals. the idea is that the first thing you eat is what will be absorbed first. i forgot the name of the ""method"", but i am sure you can easily find some info about it. maybe something to try?  but to go back on the pressure thing, ya i know that we tend to ""want to do our best"" etc... but, you know what, life is changin constently, and we have to adapt. another firend of mine, is vegetarian for a long time, and one day, she was at disneyland ( in paris) but , guess what there was nothing for vegetarian but lays chips or junk candies (!!!!! it is crazy!). she really was hungry, and at some point, she was feeling weak: so she had a real dish with meat! (well vegetarian if you go to disney, now you know that you should be prepared!!) well, she is not dead, she was just very very very pissed!! another story of mine, i was visiting a middle east country with a friend, and we became friends with some locals. they kindly invited us for lunch, and we bougth some food together. as there was no meat bougth, i did not mentionned anything... but actually they had chiken in the backyard, and they killed one for us. i discovered it when the chiken was on my table!!! and you know what : i never liked chiken, but this one i will never forget! i could not say to people who do not live with much that ""no no no, you dont need animal protein to be healthy, blablabla..."", they kindly offered me something precious for them. so i enjoyed the meal. other would have reacted differently, but for me at the time, that was what felt right. and i am still vegetarian and dont envisage to change my daily habits, but we are not perfects, and as i said, food should be something good and positive. something to do good to ourselves. there is no point of being vegeta*ian if it is to be unhealthy and depressed!  but dont worry, there is enough versatility in vegetarian diet to find a way that suits you!  :Dsorry,  i did not expect to write so much ^  take care! and good luck"
Vegetarianism,2wgh11,InterestingDrummer,8,Thu Feb 19 21:28:20 2015 UTC,"Vegetarians are a group of people who are more vulnerable to iron deficiency than most people, as are women.  You fall in both categories. The iron in meat is simply more easily absorbed than the iron in plants, and you menstruate as well. Aside from taking supplements, eating a varied, iron-rich diet can help. Cutting down on tea consumption (especially before or just after meals) can help.  Now anything that involves diets and the science around it is constantly being debated, and I am not an expert per se. Still, as a healthy young guy who doesn't get any adverse effects from being a vegetarian, I'd feel uncomfortable judging you for starting to eat some meat again.

I had to take those iron tablets that gave me stomach aches and made me generally miserable, I know how awful it feels. What I do now, except of course pay attention to diet, is every now and then take a multivitamin that has iron. I get those water-soluble ones that taste like lemonade, and I don't experience any side-effects. Probably because the iron levels in the tablets I had to take before are ridiculously high as they are prescribed to quickly boost your levels, while the vitamin-lemonade stuff has just enough to reach your daily goal (or 50% of your goal or whatever, depends on the brand).  All the women in my family, of which I am the only vegetarian, have had problems with their iron, which leads me to believe that it's something genetic and we're just not good at absorbing it, heme or non-heme. But now, with the occasional multivitamin (once a week tops for me) my levels are perfectly average again.  Another thing that helped immensely, is severely reducing my intake of tea and milk. They, along with coffee, hinder absorption, especially if consumed shortly after an iron-rich meal. Eggs do this too. On the flip side, vitamin C helps absorption.

Secondly never drink tea, coffee or soda just before, during or soon after a meal; all these drinks contain tannins which prevent your digestive system from absorbing certain nutrients including iron.   Apologies if you've heard all this before, hope you find something that helps!"
Vegetarianism,2wgh11,mohitkr05,1 point,Thu Feb 19 20:36:34 2015 UTC,"Iron deficiency doesn't necessarily come by itself - there are a few key issues that it is interrelated with.  If you consume excess calcium/milk products then it can bind with your dietary iron and make it less absorbable.  If you consume large amounts of spinach, especially uncooked, the oxalic acid inhibits iron absorption too.  Beans and legumes have phytates which also inhibit iron absorption, however soaking them overnight or fermenting them will dramatically reduced phytates.  Iron requires B vitamins and vitamin C particularly. Are you low in B vitamins? Did it come up on your blood work?  You can supplement B vitamins with regular nutritional yeast in your diet, but if it's seriously low I'd consider getting injections to boost your levels.  For vitamin C, iron needs to be consumed at around the same time as it, or near enough.  Have you considered taking a daily multivitamin to help cover any gaps in your diet?"

Vegetarianism,2wgh11,Cryovolcanoes,1 point,Thu Feb 19 21:10:17 2015 UTC,"Since you are getting iron, the other side is your ability to absorb it. You might consider whether you have any diseases or other nutritional deficiencies that could affect your ability to absorb iron. Other nutrients that can help absorb iron are said to be calcium, phytates, and tannins. Some medications also reduce your ability to absorb iron, such as omeprazol/prilosec.  In other words, if you aren't finding any solutions, consider that your iron deficiency may be a symptom of something else which needs to be addressed... particularly if it seems you are getting sufficient amounts of iron from a dietary perspective."

When I bit into one I realized it had bacon in it. I spat it out and threw away the quiche that I'd bitten into. I felt sick to my stomach, went to rinse my mouth out very thoroughly until I felt better (I got teary eyes too!). There were two more quiches that were untouched, but none of my roommates were at home so I didn't have anyone to give them to. I felt too guilty to throw them away so I put them in the fridge. They stayed there for a couple more days until they went bad and I had to throw them away after all, since the only one who'd come home during that time was my also vegetarian boyfriend. I felt really bad when I tossed them in the trash.  It truly sucks, but things like this happen from time to time.

But hear me out: grains (the weirder the better: millet, buckwheat/kasha, oat groats, rye berries, spring/winter wheat, teff &c.) are some of the heartiest crops out there, they can be grown with near-monocultural methods and without a lot of pesticides. They're incredibly cheap for how nutritious/filling/versatile they are (remember, these are grains grown and consumed by some of the poorest people in the world in the worst climates for agriculture, in some instances with history dating back thousands of years), and they're great as leftovers.  Of course, the same could be said for eating a large amount and wide variety of beans, so do that too.  tl;dr: more (& weirder) beans & grains, and not necessarily in that order."

Variety is key to being healthy. Eat as many different kinds of fruits, vegetables, grains, legumes, nuts, seeds, and especially dark leafies as you can afford to buy.

Vegetarianism,2v23nd,slightlyturnedoff,2,Sun Feb 8 06:05:18 2015 UTC,Yes. The only reason to go vegan is because of the ethics surrounding animal exploitation. I can't break it down any more than that.

Vegetarianism,2v23nd,veganwhatever,2,Sun Feb 8 03:50:28 2015 UTC,"Okay, if we're going to go there we can, soooo~  Listen here: as much as I'd like to go into the whole ethics thing (by the way, it's ""morality"", because ethics are the study concerned with morality and morality is an applied set of belief about how things should be done) I don#t even have to. That is because it is a question of logic:  Vegan or not is a binary, mutually exclusive choice with no grey area in between: you either hold a vegan diet, meaning you do not eat anything of animal origin. If you don't trust me on that please take a peek to the right, they put a definition in the sidebar for easy reference. Adding to that that fish are biologically part of the kingdom of animalia they are defined as animals. Conclusion: vegans don't eat fish. Hence there is no such thing as a ""pesca-vegan"". That word is an oxymoron and contradicts itself. You can not be a vegan if you eat fish, end of story. No morality or ethics involved at any point, let alone any extremism - pure definition.  Technically that would make you a pescetarian who doesn't consume milk and eggs and whatever, but the whole being-vegan thing is dead the moment you consume anything of animal origin.  So stop putting fancy labels on yourself to sound awesome or healthy or whatever.   Now to add a personal touch (and here morality enters the field): I don't hold pescetarians in particular high regard, because most of them argue along the lines of ""oh, I eat fish, but I'm a vegetarian because I don't eat animals"" which is simply wrong, as fish = animals. Most of those I know apply the label to themselves in order to sound healthy and hip and keep up with the rest. Otherwise one could simply say ""I only eat fish, not meat"" with no need for a fancy label. But this is their own personal choice and as long as they don't go on about how they are vegan it is at least a valid label. Now something else entirely is if someone tells me ""I'm a vegetarian"" and eats fish, let alone ""I'm a vegan and I eat fish"". What kind of rotten logic is this? Sound hip much? Seriously, all it does is display an utter lack of knowledge in a field where you claim a label.  I do know and accept that there are people who live a mostly vegan lifestyle and eat fish. So they will abstain from leather products, dairy, honey, whatever and still eat fish. Most of those I have encountered do this because they argue that at least the fish had a free life until they are being caught. Fair enough as long as they say it as ""I live a mostly vegan lifestyle, but I also eat fish, so I'm not a vegan"" instead of ""I eat fish, but I am a vegan"". That's kinda like saying ""well, I hit smacked your sister square over her mouth for no reason, but I really AM a peaceful person!"".  Get me now or want to argue some more?"

Vegetarianism,2sfa95,Tom_Anks,3,Thu Jan 15 13:10:23 2015 UTC,"It is more complicated then that to me. I don't want to support places that slaughter animals sure, but on the other hand, I think voting with your dollar can have a positive effect on the businesses. The more people who by vegetarian products, the more they will order, which supports the production of vegetarian products. This also gives meat eaters another option, they might try and like a veggie burger. It is also great for new vegetarians. one of the biggest obstacles for converting fully to the lifestyle is the availability of vegetarian food in popular places they might frequent with their friends and families. The more places that serve it, the less intimidating the lifestyle seems.   At the same time, I am not going to go to a BBQ house and just order a potato. But if that BBQ place started advertising new faux meat products, I would definitely go there and try it out to support the new addition.  If no vegs came their to support it, it would jsut get taken off the menu."
Vegetarianism,2sfa95,existentialdude,2,Thu Jan 15 13:35:44 2015 UTC,I understand what you mean but I'm not sure I agree. I'd rather go to businesses that care more about ethical concerns than the number of customers they can get into their stores. For example I'm much more likely to go to the vegetarian cafe near me than go to a KFC just to try their vegetarian option.
Vegetarianism,2sfa95,Tom_Anks,1 point,Thu Jan 15 13:45:11 2015 UTC,"vegetarian cafe near me than go to a KFC just to try their vegetarian option.   Sure, but what if you are with friends who weren't vegetarian? Also, I think big chain restaurants aren't going away anytime soon, so I think the more encouragement they have to offer meat-alternatives the better.   Now time to wax on philosophically: I like to lead by example. I really think my actions influence others. When people see me order veggie burgers, I think it shows them that people do eat these and like them. It might make them feel a little less weird about wanting to try veggieburgers/vegetarianism themselves. Numerous times ordering veggieburgers at popular restaurants the server or cashier will ask me ""Are those any good? I've always wanted to try one."" I say yeah, and maybe a few of them actually did try them, and maybe one or two of them actually enjoyed them. It comes down to the presence of vegetarianism to me. I think the more it is out there and the more it is embraced is a good thing. I would much rather burger king workers say, ""There is quite a few people who order the bkveggie"" than ""No one every orders that."""

Vegetarianism,2rwibp,funchy,22,Fri Jan 9 22:07:38 2015 UTC,"I skimmed the first page, but when I hit the bottom and saw that this continued for SIX PAGES i noped out. Sorry. Hunting is far more ethical than factory farming. If a person chooses to eat meat, and makes the choice to kill that meat for themselves through legal and regulated hunting, I have no qualms with that."
Vegetarianism,2rwibp,RogueVenus,8,Sat Jan 10 05:10:00 2015 UTC,"Yup. I'd rather someone actually hunting, killing, and butchering their own meat rather than just posturing and just saying that they would do it.  Given the environmental and social effects of factory farming and slaughterhouses, hunting is a preferable option."
Vegetarianism,2rwibp,Buffalo__Buffalo,3,Sat Jan 10 11:35:08 2015 UTC,I totally agree. I'm more annoyed at people who cringe at the death involved in their food than the ones who do the killing. If you are going to eat something you should know where it comes from.
Vegetarianism,2rwibp,OliverTheWanderer,6,Sat Jan 10 08:35:02 2015 UTC,"This article is a rambling rant. The author, who must have a large audience, should know better than to start a conversation correlating hunting with sociopathic behaviors by using youtube videos of bad parenting as her evidence. That idea -a rather unfounded one, imho- would likely need to have decades-long research to prove on a scientific level, and such research would be difficult to fund given the sheer volume of variables. This woman seems to forget that correlation does not equal causation."
Vegetarianism,2rwibp,Vercury,2,Sat Jan 10 14:24:45 2015 UTC,"Lots of problems with this article.   A grown woman poisoning her neighbor's dog is completely fucked up on several levels and should be rightfully condemned.  A child accidentally killing a kitten by not being old enough to realize any better is in no way an equivalent. I find her view of animals to be overly patronizing.  I'm having trouble trying to find the words to describe what I mean here but she doesn't seem to feel that animals deserve any sort of intrinsic respect, just that hunting should be looked down on. Hunting is a skill.  Obviously humans are at an advantage but assuming you aren't breaking the laws it is not an easy thing to track and kill an animal in its natural environment.  I would wager a majority of the population would be unable to do it unassisted.  Accomplishing any feet that could be derived like that justifies a certain amount of celebration. This woman is admittedly not a vegetarian.  If she is going to consume meat the absolutely most ethical way to do so in my opinion is through hunting, followed by raising the animals herself, followed by some sort of communal living situation, followed by buying from ethically focused farm, last of which would be from factory farming.  I would be surprised if she is even buying ethically."
Vegetarianism,2rwibp,Kerplonk,2,Mon Feb 2 01:59:03 2015 UTC,"There are big differences between killing for enjoyment and accidentally killing a fragile animal and hunting.

Remove leaves from stem and toss desired chip-size kale pieces with extra virgin olive oil and whatever spices you enjoy and arrange each leaf in a single layer on a microwavable plate so they aren't touching or overlapping.

Coat large pan (or pot for larger quantities) with vegetable/olive oil and add in kale. Stir until leaves are coated with oil and they cook down in the pan. Add desired seasonings. I recommend nutritional yeast flakes for a cheesy flavor, 1/4 cup moistened with water to make it like a sauce. Garlic, garlic salt, and onion powder are good in there, too. Add in tofu and cook until tofu is heated. It might not be your favorite the first couple times, but if you are determined to eat kale, the taste can be altered with seasonings and whatever you want to add in, and it is very filling. The taste took a while for me to get used to, but now I crave it sometimes."

Vegetarianism,2qx24g,cuberail,5,Wed Dec 31 16:16:43 2014 UTC,"Methionine restriction has been around for decades. This is not news.  It doesn't just extend lifespan, it also greatly reduces risks of cancers. Dr. Piper has not himself written any papers on it. I think he just made a presentation.   Methionine is one of the EAAs with sulfur. It is present at higher levels in animal-source proteins. But if you are meeting your RDAs with plant foods, you are getting more methionine than the amount that they use in the animal studies to extend lifespans.  But I think it might lend some support to the idea that there is no need to chase after extra protein to be healthy. It might be better to get just enough.

As a vegetarian for 19 years, I have to roll my eyes a bit when I hear the whole ""all-or-nothing"" lines thrown around about eating meat. Without wasting yours and my time qualifying myself here, I believe I have earned to right to say this to all of my veggie brothers and sisters:   WE ARE NOT SPECIAL  Being a vegan/veggie does not put us any higher than meat eaters. There is no vegetarian badge that we can earn or lose by the choices we make.  We are vegetarians because we have made conscious decisions based on our personal experiences and the information that we have been given.    I have seen so many positive changes in American diet culture over the years. When I started, the only vegetarian options out there was salad and starches.  Now, it is rare not to have at least one veggie entre option.   Hell, I remember when recycling was ""only for hippie, tree-huggers"" and now look at where we are.    The more we are able to change the perception of eating meat in our culture, the less meat will be consumed.  The less meat that is consumed, the less suffering to animals there will be.  Plain and simple.  I am sorry if this offends some of you, but someone had to say it."
Vegetarianism,2pqroh,ZeusWayne,2,Fri Dec 19 15:26:13 2014 UTC,"I absolutely agree.  I've been vegetarian for 13 years and people are always more than ready to try and see me as a holier than thou type.  I think when you take away the judgement of people who either have no desire to give up or have struggled to not eat meat you open up a lot of possibility.  As he said, in an ideal world no one would eat meat, but that's unrealistic (and you could argue ""well not with that attitude"",but seriously it's just incredibly, statistically unlikely).    What is realistic is forcing an industry to change their destructive and harmful practices through lower demand and while striving to enforce better and more humane regulations."
Vegetarianism,2pqroh,ThisRaviolisTooSpicy,1 point,Fri Dec 19 23:19:43 2014 UTC,"For me the frustrating part is that this diet acknowledges that consumption of animal products is wrong in every way, but still participates in the evil on a regular basis.

Edit: Also worth noting that although I personally am poor, probably no one in that audience (and few if any watching this video) lives in a food desert, so let's avoid that potential obstacle."
Vegetarianism,2pqroh,callmegoat,15,Sun Dec 28 17:10:47 2014 UTC,"This mentality is frustrating for me. I am a vegetarian and have been for 3 years, vegan for 1 summer and I am proud of the impact that I have made on reducing the animal suffering that occurs on my behalf.   Yes there is more I can do to reduce animal suffering, but there is more you can do in everything in life. Following your line of thought, we shouldn't recycle plastic bottles or glass if we don't also recycle every food scrap, every piece of paper until every inch is covered in writing, every piece of fabric until it is worn through.   There is always more you can do, but attacking people for their efforts saying they can do better will only drive them away. We need to be grateful that hey, at least they're trying to make a positive change in their life and in animal's lives.   Something is always better than nothing, especially when it comes to saving lives and the environment."

Vegetarianism,2pqroh,TheIronMark,-4,Fri Dec 19 06:13:20 2014 UTC,"The problem with this comparison is that it's still hyperbole. Animals are not people, end of story. While I'm against factory farming, this kind of argument drives people away since you're basically equating meat-eaters to Hitler. You erode your position by making such a ridiculous claim."
Vegetarianism,2pqroh,TheIronMark,0,Fri Dec 19 17:20:58 2014 UTC,"Replace the animals with humans and it is the exact same thing - actually worse because of the sheer number. You don't have to believe that animals are people to understand that they have the same aversion to death and torture that humans have. The idea that nothing that isn't ""a person"" is meaningless and can be subjected to any treatment is actually the justification for just about every genocide in human history. By maintaining that belief you are not only justifying the continued slaughter and torture of billions of animals, but are also maintaining the foundation for genocide of humans."

When I worked at a company in a rural area, I was teased frequently. Now that I work and live in a city, I feel like my choices aren't as rare and most of the rude or hateful comments have stopped. Of course, I try not to bring it up unless necessary, which may also be a contributing factor.  I also think that it requires more effort than eating meat. I cook most nights (it's more affordable and I also love to cook). I can see the declining health factor being a problem for some.

One thing I do like about the movement are really nice folks who give great advice on delicious vegetarian restaurants or meals.   If all the effort put into being combative were put into encouraging everyone to forgoe eating meat for one meal a day, instead of ""full on conversion"" it would have a similar effect to actually adding 10s of millions of vegetarians to the ranks.   It isn't a religion, it is about the long term effect of reducing meat consumption. It is flat out healthier from a personal, economic, health and environmental standpoint. Encouraging a broader spectrum of people to cut out a sizable portion of their meat consumption is a far better way to achieve these results than tryimg to force full on conversion and in the process losing out on a broad reduction in meat product consumption."

Vegetarianism,2oa3j7,CritFailingLife,5,Thu Dec 4 20:34:52 2014 UTC,"Going along with some of the other ideas, get some powdered hummus, pita bread or tortillas, canned beans, and 1-2 days worth of veggies at a time and do wraps. Powdered hummus is obviously nowhere near as good as fresh or prepackaged hummus, but it's better than nothing (I've used it on backpacking trips).   With a small camping stove, you can also make things like couscous (easier than rice since it cooks so quickly), which you can flavor differently with different additives to the boiling water before you put the couscous in  (hot sauce, chunky peanut butter and maybe a bit of sugar or honey for a Thai-esque flavor, dehydrated veggies and a can of veggie broth for a garden medley flavor, etc).   Instant oatmeal - just boil water and you're good to go and you can add fresh fruit to make it interesting.   Grab a small cooler and a small bag of ice and you can keep your fruit and veggies happy.   Individual portions of hermetically sealed milk (cow, soy, or other) meant for lunches will keep without refrigeration for things like breakfast cereal.   Canned things like mixed bean salad are relatively tasty and easy and healthy (if you don't drink the sauce it's packaged in anyway, varies by brand if you do) and don't need refrigeration if you eat the while can in a meal, so it might prove easier than a can of soup, which you'd have to heat.   Depending on the parks in your area and your comfort with shared grills, you might be able to make things like kebabs in a local park with picnic facilities or even use the grill to put your pot on for cooking.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Actually, come to think of it, just google ""vegetarian backpacking menu""....you often only have a very basic bunson burner and one pot type cooking set up while backpacking and food has to be non perishable.   The first result I got is a three day, two person meal plan  Second is a company that sells prepackaged veggie pack packing meals"

Make wraps. you can add bananas for a sweet wrap, or hot sauce for a savory wrap (I usually use cabbage leaves as the wrapper for that and cabbage will keep a few days at least in my experience if it isn't very hot). Get some chocolate peanut butter, too, because it's damn tasty.   Fresh fruits and veggies that don't need refrigeration are good. Those Indian packets mentioned are good. Trader Joe's has a couple that I like (the purple eggplant one and the red one with chickpeas). Powdered hummus is good if you can find some (try places with bulk bins).     Good luck!"
Vegetarianism,2oa3j7,danafawn,2,Thu Dec 4 23:17:06 2014 UTC,"Check to see if you have local YWCA that can help you shelter yourself and away from the elements.  Canned fruits and vegetables will work great for you.  Protein bars and Peanut butter works great.  Just FYI, many of the local 711 or Starbucks will allow you to use the microwave.  If you can afford the frozen meals, go to any of these 2 franchises.  Frozen food may not be optimal for healthy eating, but, they can be very filling.  Some of the weight watchers meals are affordable and healthy  Good luck with that and I really hope you don't have to live outside.  I will pray for you to find a safe place to stay.

Now, as for how vegetarianism can be healthy (and how it should look ideally) is this: all that space previously occupied by meat in your diet is now replaced by vegetables (or legumes). If you eat your recommended servings of vegetables, even as a meat eater, there's really not much room to fit in anything else.   Cutting out meat and replacing it with vegetables is healthy provided that it's in a balanced diet."

Vegetarianism,2nxh2j,alohacarly,4,Mon Dec 1 11:59:51 2014 UTC,right now I'm just doing it for my health   This is why I switched to a whole foods plant based diet (I chose the almost entirely vegan version).  The book that convinced me to switch was Eat to Live by Joel Fuhrman.  It's a great book to read if you're trying to get healthy and lose weight.  I would recommend looking around elsewhere for recipes though.  Most of the ones from his book are very involved.    The most important food to add to the beans and rice you listed above is lots of veggies!
Vegetarianism,2nxh2j,poot142,6,Tue Dec 2 05:37:07 2014 UTC,"Good for you on getting healthy! I think you can never eat too many vegetables when trying to lose weight, so I have found that eating a giant plate of veggie stir fry with tofu left me feeling full but never gross. My problem has always been that I have a verrrry hearty appetite even my husband finds it funny I eat more than him, but the secret is I make sure the ""more"" part is always vegetables and not the noodles or whatever, you can only be healthier if your plate is loaded with veggies!  Here are a few things I have found to work I hope it is helpful to you:   walking - This always makes me feel good! It is great exercise and I always feel lighter especially if I just ate more pizza than is lady-like. And if I can bring someone along and chat their ears off it is therapeutic. I run too but walking works just as well as long as you don't take a leisurely pace work your butt muscles a little ya know? veggie stir fry with tofu - fast easy filling, throw in onion garlic bell peppers brussel sprouts or broccoli, tofu,  and a small potato sliced thin with soy sauce and sriracha or ginger seitan - it is harder to find than tofu but I love the texture better, it is less soft and absorbs flavor better. Whole Foods or health food stores will have it, if tofu isn't your thing try this. Tofurky Artisan sausages Chicken and Apple flavor - the best veggie/vegan sausages I have ever had, the flavor and texture are perfect! If you cut it up and throw it in a stir fry instead of tofu you won't need much soy sauce since the sausage is so flavorful. Usually one entire sausage and lots of veggies is two meals for me. Here is a link so you can see what the packaging looks like, I find these in my local Safeway grocery store: Tofurky Artisan hummus - I have never used a nutribullet but I assume it acts like a food processor so  if you get one make your own hummus! Throw in garlic cloves one can of garbanzo beans, some tahini, a little olive oil, salt, and lemon juice, so good! I like to make Bagel sandwiches with hummus, tofu fried in sriracha, spinach and tomato, maybe some morning star sausage My husband likes it too since the tofu acts like egg in texture. Vege-Burger recipe i have perfected over the years  This veggie burger recipe  - my husband found it on reddit and made it for me and even he loves it! Don't let the beets scare you it is dang good, also I use Queso fresco instead of paneer since I can never find paneer. I will have one topped with a little extra queso fresco, two if I ran 5 miles that day and earned it lol! It is filling and guilt-free for me.   Good luck! Stay active even if it is walking the dogs a little each day, and eat lots of veggies! If you have to have the french fries at your fave restaurant get them as a side to a salad with vinegarette that way you balance out the bad. Ok I am done sorry I went on a bit!"
Vegetarianism,2nxh2j,hasorsby,3,Mon Dec 1 14:46:12 2014 UTC,"Vegan here! So my food ideas will be centered around that, but they work for you too. :) These are meals that I cook regularly:  Breakfast:   Smoothie- Almond milk or water with a splash of juice, frozen berries, spinach or kale, and a good protein powder. Garden of Life is fantastic. English muffin or toast with avocado, tomato, and spinach. Seasoned with basil, rosemary, or some salt. Toast with almond butter and some fresh fruit Overnight oats- the night before put about 1/3 cup oats, 2 TBSP chia seeds, 1 cup almond/milk of choice, and some sweetener in a jar. Leave in the fridge overnight. Top with fruit, nuts, cinnamon, etc. Tofu scramble- saute whatever veggies you like in some olive oil. Crumble tofu and saute with veggies. Season with nutritional yeast, salt, herbs, whatever! Breakfast burrito- avocado, kale or spinach and salsa wrapped in a warm tortilla   Lunch: * Wrap with hummus, tomatoes, whatever veggies you have on hand, and some Sriracha * Salad with garbanzo beans or something filling * Leftovers from dinner  Snacks: * Granola * Trail mix * Nuts * Fresh fruit * Hummus and veggies * Coconut yogurt- I like the SO Delicious greek style  Dinner:    Stir Fry- Bell peppers, broccoli, onion, carrots, snap peas or whatever other veggies you have on hand. Saute in a small amount of oil. Season with some soy sauce or liquid aminos and garlic chili paste. Serve with rice. Add tofu to the stir fry if you wish. Black bean burritos or tacos. Saute some onion and garlic in a pot. Add a can of drained black beans, some water or vegetable broth, and seasonings of your choice. Simmer. Serve with tortillas or taco shells and the toppings of your choice. Bok choy- Lightly saute garlic and ginger in a large pan. Add bok choy and saute some more. Serve with rice. I sauteed the bok choy with some veggie broth and extra oil today and served over whole wheat spaghetti noodles. Tofu spaghetti sauce- crumble tofu into your spaghetti sauce. The tofu makes the dish more filling Italian inspired soup- Saute some onion, bell pepper, and other desired vegetables in a large pot. Add veggie broth and a can of diced tomatoes. Simmer. Add garbanzo beans and/or noodles. When the soup is almost done, add a bunch of kale. Season with oregano, basil, parsley, rosemary, salt, and some red pepper flakes.   These are just a few ideas. I highly recommend looking up veggie recipes for your current favorite dishes. This reduces the likelihood that you will crave what you ate before.   Congrats on your decision! I transitioned from a ""normal"" meat and cheese diet to only eating chicken and fish to vegetarianism to veganism. I feel so much healthier than I did before and lost tons of weight. Feel free to message me if you have any questions!  Oh and the Oh She Glows blog was actually one of my major inspirations for becoming a vegan. She has great recipes that tend to be pretty simple."
Vegetarianism,2nxh2j,dibblah,2,Tue Dec 2 05:19:45 2014 UTC,"Hats off to your healthy living plan!  A couple of things:   You might end up overcompensating with salt to compensate for the lack of meat - try spices or low sodium vegetable stock if you need a bit more flavour.  Eggs are cheap and filling and only 100 calories a piece (although you might want to watch it for the cholesterol.)  My favourite pasta sauce is tomatoes with celery and carrots.  Blitz it with a food processor afterwards for a really creamy, filling pasta sauce- it tastes like you added marscapone or cream but it's a whole lot healthier.    Good luck!"

Vegetarianism,2nttq8,_tree_hugger,30,Sun Nov 30 07:14:55 2014 UTC,"Look at what all the major medical associations say. That is the consensus of what most of the scientists think. They all recommend a diet rich in plants and low in animal fat and refined sugars and they say that a well planned vegetarian/vegan diet can be healthy.  You can find studies to prove anything, there is a huge number of studies on nutrition published every year. It's very difficult to keep up to date with all these studies, to read and judge the methodology of all of them. That's why these consensus guidelines are made, not only in nutrition but in all medical fields.  Also, as the promoters of a certain diet and gaining a lot of money from it, those bloggers clearly have an agenda and are not necessarily very credible."

Vegetarianism,2nttq8,Tilduke,29,Wed Feb 4 22:43:04 2015 UTC,You can essentially find studies to support anything you have to say regarding diets. Of course the founder of a diet based around huge levels of meat consumption is going to be critical of diets that feature no meat consumption. I could just as equally bring up all the studies that show the link between meat consumption and health risks.   I think the key point is if your blood tests come back okay and you feel okay then you are probably okay.
Vegetarianism,2nttq8,M4124124,6,Sun Nov 30 07:52:46 2014 UTC,"Some of these issues aren't limited to vegans and non are unsolveable problems while being vegan, either. I'm pretty sure I had iodine deficiency before going vegan. I didn't use iodized salt or eat seafood. After I went vegan, I became more interested in nutrition and realized that that was probably the source of my low thyroid issues. I added a dash of kelp flakes to my dinners and my thyroid test results improved to normal.   Vegans should take a B12 supplement because there are no plant sources (and please be very skeptical about this or that health food that supposedly is the holy grail of B12 because there are a lot of B12 analogues that don't work for us). A lot of people should take a B12 supplement who aren't vegan, so it really doesn't bother me that I have to take one.   Dietary taurine is essential for cats, not humans. We do make it. And if there is some epidemic of taurine deficiency in vegans, the risk of cardiovascular disease does not seem elevated. People on plant-based diets are at a lower risk than meat eaters or even lacto-ovo vegetarians, so the solution isn't to eat more animals."

Vegetarianism,2nttq8,Tom_Anks,2,Sun Nov 30 19:38:50 2014 UTC,"Possibly. It depends on how much you are getting from those foods and how well you absorb it. If you're over 50 or drink a lot or have digestive issues, a B12 supplement is recommended because of absorption issues whether you are vegetarian or not. You can check http://www.nutritiondata.com for info of the amounts in animal products. It may be less than you think, especially if you don't eat those regularly (and it's good to not eat those so much anyhow). And it's good to get well over 100% of the recommendations because you may absorb less. B12 is very safe. Our bodies store it and it can take years to develop deficiency if you had good stores of it to begin with, but we should try to keep those supplies well maintained and not get lulled into a false sense of security since B12 deficiency can be very serious."

And just about anyone can call themselves a ""nutritionist"" (in the U.S., at least). I think it's a good idea for everyone to talk to a registered dietitian at some point if that's an accessible option (and I wish it were more easily accessible to everyone because goodness knows diet is extremely important to good health).

Environmentalism is also a plus.   2) How strict of a vegetarian are you, and what dietary compromises do you make?   Sometimes I have to take a pill and unfortunately some are only available in gelatin.   Sometimes when I eat out I accept that my meal is cooked on the same grill as the meat.     3) What health challenges do you face being a vegetarian (e.g., getting enough iron or protein, or other vitamins or minerals)?  None really.   B12 is the only thing vegetarians or vegans might worry about,  and that's easily fixed with a supplement.   The idea that vegetarians are protein deficient is a common misunderstanding.    Supposedly vegetarians are supposed to be at risk for iron deficiency (the whole heme versus non heme iron and absorption levels), but I've never had it be a problem.   The vegetarians and vegans I know in real life have never mentioned it.    4) What non-vegetarian foods do you miss the most?   None really.  And I'd go vegan if I could find a cheese replacement that I can tolerate the taste of.  5) Would you consider eating products with cricket powder as a protein source? Why or why not?  Insects are absolutely not vegetarian.    Why wouldn't i?  Because I don't need to in order to meet my nutritional needs.     Because you'd need to do what amounts to factory farming of them to make the product profitable, and just the idea of factory farming evokes images of overcrowding, disease, living in one's own excrement,  pharmaceutical use to control disease or promote growth, the unnatural diet which can affect nutrition profile.   If I felt I needed extra protein, why would I choose Powdered Cricket Protein over common vegetarian ones such as  soy or pea?"
Vegetarianism,2nf8r1,funchy,2,Wed Nov 26 03:43:01 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the response, funchy. Interesting hearing about B12 and cheese replacement. On your last point on soy vs pea vs cricket protein, my only note would be that creating protein from crickets might be more sustainable than protein from soy or peas. Crickets can be raised vertically (use less land) and be fed organic byproducts, diverting waste from landfills. Thanks for the feedback!"
Vegetarianism,2nf8r1,blargh9001,3,Wed Nov 26 18:03:51 2014 UTC,"5 years because animals. Vegan. I do sometimes eat bivalves. None. I have never had any problems. I have always been healthy and active. I don't miss any foods. No. I don't really feel any empathy with them, but they have enough of a nervous system that they deserve the benefit of the doubt (orders of magnitude more nerve cells than bivalves, and in more centralised structures). Yes, I am aware that insects get killed farming of plants, but deliberately breeding them wold take it to a whole new level, and I don't want to be a part of that. There is just no need for it, you guys are searching for a solution that already exists and is staring you right in the face, PLANTS!"
Vegetarianism,2nf8r1,blargh9001,1 point,Wed Nov 26 09:09:54 2014 UTC,"Thanks, Blargh9001. I've never enjoyed bivalves myself. Maybe I should try them again! I guess my only response would be that soy from vegetables does have an environmental impact (soy farming is land and water intensive, and my lead to deforestation), and crickets and other insects can be raised vertically and fed high-quality organic byproducts. We're hoping there's a market out there for an alternative sustainable protein source, for people who don't have an ethical problem with an org. raising and killing, milling, and powdering insects. All the best!"
Vegetarianism,2nf8r1,TheIronMark,2,Wed Nov 26 18:12:50 2014 UTC,"Soy and other plants in the amounts currently cultivated could feed the world many times over already. It is not soy that is causing deforestation, but the animals it is fed to. It would be a non-issue if enough people went vegan, so there's no need to resort to killing any animals.  It won't change my opinion about eating them either way, but out of curiosity a) Are there enough of these by-products that you could raise enough crickets to replace a substantial amount of meat consumption if you did manage to create a demand? b) Are there no opportunity costs? It may not currently be used, but are you sure there is no use for it that doesn't involve killing that could also benefit the environment?"
Vegetarianism,2nf8r1,no_you_cannot,1 point,Wed Nov 26 18:37:34 2014 UTC,"Hello again, blargh9001. There are tons and tons of organic byproducts. Currently the main opportunity cost for some of the byproducts is feeding it to pigs. In terms of sustainability (water use, feed to meat ratio, feed requirements) pigs have less of an environmental impact than cow. Chicken are much more eco-friendly than cows and pigs. Crickets convert 1.7 parts feed to 1 part cricket, are ~70% protein (dry weight), and use very little water to raise; they make a tiny environmental impact compared to raising traditional livestock. The 'ick' factor is a considerable hurdle. But organizations like EXO and Chapul and Bitty and Six Foods seem to be doing well. Vegetarians may not be our best target group, but all these responses have been extremely informative. Other communities like extreme athletes or eco-vegetarians (at least ones OK eating insects) might be a better target group. It's not easy changing the world, but we call all make an effort to try, no? Thanks for the conversation!"

Vegetarianism,2nf8r1,cephaloman,2,Wed Nov 26 18:13:31 2014 UTC,"1) How long have you been a vegetarian, and what motivates you to continue to be one?   ~16 years. If I can't kill something, I'm not going to eat it.   2) How strict of a vegetarian are you, and what dietary compromises do you make?   Relatively strict. I'll eat fish sauce if it's in my Thai food, but otherwise I'm a lacto-ovo vegetarian.   3) What health challenges do you face being a vegetarian (e.g., getting enough iron or protein, or other vitamins or minerals)?   B vitamins are really the biggest challenge, but there are supplements. Protein was tough for a while until I started eating more tempeh and homemade seitan.   4) What non-vegetarian foods do you miss the most?   Honestly, I don't think I really miss anything from a craving or taste perspective. It can be a bit of a pain to travel to other countries, however, especially if I don't speak the language and can't ensure my food is meatless.   5) Would you consider eating products with cricket powder as a protein source?   Only to fend off starvation.   Why or why not?   Primarily because I wouldn't kill a cricket if I found one in my house; I'd just put it outside. Crickets aren't that much different from lobsters and I don't eat those, either. Diets like this are pretty much an arbitrary live drawn in the sand and I won't eat things that have a face. Regarding environmental impact, insects are getting a lot of attention lately as a cheap and sustainable protein source, but the existing vegetarian protein sources are already cheap and plentiful."
Vegetarianism,2nf8r1,spacenout21,2,Wed Nov 26 05:19:00 2014 UTC,"Thanks, TheIronMark! Interesting hearing about your motivations. ""I won't eat things that have a face."" love it. All the best!"
Vegetarianism,2nf8r1,spacenout21,2,Wed Nov 26 18:06:52 2014 UTC,"1) 8 or so years, motivation was I just realized I didn't really eat meat and I didn't like the taste of it. So why contribute to an animal being killed?   2) I avoid it as much as possible, which I don't have to worry about at home. But I realize when I'm out with friends I know there is probably some meat substance involved, mostly not obvious in the food...  3) I take blood tests every other year and B12 was a little under what I needed, protein was perfect, and I actually had too much iron from eating so many greens. I take B12 supplements that dissolve in your mouth.  4) I don't miss anything. I could become vegan without looking back, but cheese is so yummy   5) No, that kind of defeats the purpose of being vegetarian. And they are not necessary for any type of supplement because plants and fungi already supply the majority of what I need, according to my blood results. So I don't think there's a point to using crickets as a supplement"

I tried meat at age six, and got addicted to junk food (especially lunchables). I started dieting in middleschool and eventually found my way back to veganism. I wish I had never left."
Vegetarianism,2nazc3,TheSurrealDeal,5,Tue Nov 25 22:53:34 2014 UTC,"My mum raised my sister and I as vegetarians, even though my Dad was a meat-eater throughout our childhoods. We were both given the choice around the age of 6 (can't remember exactly when) as to whether we wanted to continue being vegetarian or to start eating meat. My Sister became a meat-eater before returning to vegetarianism around 15, whereas I stayed vegetarian. I think neither of us had issue with being raised vegetarian and in fact we were so normalised to vegetarianism that we had to be reminded multiple times by our parents that dishes we assumed were vege (e.g. quorn/bean chilli) were actually usually made with meat - often a difficult surprise at birthday parties! My mum was always careful about ensuring we had healthy diets and I think the evidence is pretty clear from most sources that vegetarianism can be beneficial for health at all ages contrary to what a lot of people think. I don't know of any difficulties our parents had convincing doctors/health visitors choice to raise us vegetarian though being the UK the NHS may be different to the system where you're based. We also had a pretty good family GP.  We're all now vegetarian and apart from the odd fish/chicken that my grandma used to feed us (with the best of intentions, not sure she was convinced about the health of vegetarianism!) I've never eaten meat. My sister and I are both healthy, did plenty of sport and have done well academically. Though of course its impossible to tell neither of us would say we have suffered in any way from our parents choice! In fact we're both glad that enjoying food, knowing where it came from and in general being aware of the moral and ethical dimensions of everyday actions many people perform without ever thinking about were part of our upbringing.  I think in our case giving us a choice probably right, although I imagine if it were me I would find it difficult if my child wanted meat and I would then have to cook it despite disagreeing with their choice. Perhaps in a fully vegetarian family such an explicit choice might not have to be presented to such a young child? I think by having discussions with the child once they get old enough to understand the issue is important - I really do think that once explained to them where meat comes from most children (especially those who have eaten well and enjoy food without meat!) would choose vegetarianism. At the same time it is certainly important not to guilt trip children and to respect their decisions. Good luck!"
Vegetarianism,2nazc3,goolies,3,Tue Nov 25 01:16:19 2014 UTC,"Thanks for sharing. I agree that there should be a discussion about it and children should never feel guilt about choosing to eat meat if they wish to.   I was wondering about some of the logistics... At the parties where you encountered dishes with meat did your family bring alternatives? Was it openly known to your friends? If so, how did they react? Or did you just simply find something else to eat?  Although I am not having children right now, I've always thought about how it'd work in the future. My SO is a meat eater and I really want to explore both options as much as possible. Of course, my preference would be to raise vegetarian with open-mindedness... And leaving most of the possible meat cooking to SO."
Vegetarianism,2nazc3,CheapTricycle,3,Tue Nov 25 03:00:55 2014 UTC,"I grew up in quite a multicultural area and so with the other kids needing halal, kosher and also some other vegetarians there was usually always a vegetarian option. I think even when I was the only one they'd usually have something vegetarian as everybody knew I was vegetarian. Don't think my parents would bring a dish for me unless it was a pot-luck kind of event. If you're from an area where Vegetarianism is a lot more unusual it could be very different I suppose.   My friends all knew I was vegetarian, not so much because I'd always talk about it with them but because I always had to ask ""is this vegetarian?"" at school/restaurants/dinners etc. As a teenager I talked about it a bit more and sometimes you got the inevitable ""hurp derp animals taste so good"" joke but I don't think it ever made a difference to most of my friends what I did or didn't eat!"
Vegetarianism,2nazc3,goolies,7,Tue Nov 25 12:47:47 2014 UTC,I was raised as a vegetarian. I was brought up that way. About the age of 15 - 16 I went behind my mother's back and began eating meat. When she found out she was awful to me but that's a different story. However as I've grown up I've realised I was much healthier as a vegetarian and never got sick or had a day of school off. My child will 100% we raised as a vegetarian but I will never make it fear me and feel like I will hate it if it eats meat. I'll explain that its better this way and I want them to be healthy until about 10 - 12 years old and then they can try meat if they want and there will be no problem with it. I just want my child to be as strong and healthy as they can be when they are young and to teach them to make the right choices regarding food :)

This is what makes me think that more conservative doctors may not be very excited about vegetarianism, but I'd think that a good research might lead us to one that will be positively thinking about it. There are already signs of vegetarian community growing even in 'strictly meat-eating' Denmark and I hope that it will only get better in the future. : )"

He is now 15, 6'5"", and regularly cycles 50 miles a time. All on a vegetarian diet.  Doctors should know vegetarianism can be healthy. You may need to reassure them a bit more, but any doctor who actually knows their science will know that simply not eating meat will not harm your child."

And even if you can't find a doctor who supports you 100% in vegetarianism, it's not the biggest deal. As long as you make sure your kids are getting a good, balanced diet and they are healthy, that's the main thing.

Seems that pretty much all of you were enjoying good health throughout your childhood and that truly encouraged me regarding raising our own children without meat. We shall definitely give them the choice of keeping the vegetarian lifestyle vs meat eating once they are capable of understanding it and we will really try to be supportive no mater what their choice would be. Both me and my SO come from families were meat was almost always the main dish and had to struggle with convincing mom and dad that one won't become sick and underfed if one has a diet different than theirs. So we really understand what the parents' support on this means for a child even if we have to face the opposite situation. We will try to plan our kids' diet as best as possible!

Vegetarianism,2nazc3,uh-oh_oh-no,3,Tue Nov 25 11:10:00 2014 UTC,"I was raised vegetarian.  Vegetarian was ""normal"" and the ""default"" way of eating, and we always viewed meat eating as wrong and unethical.  The best thing my parents did for me was to help me understand why we were a vegetarian family instead of just forcing me to be vegetarian.  They helped me understand why compassion towards animals is important.  Once I internalized the idea that animal welfare was something I should care about, my vegetarianism became my own.  It wasn't something they were forcing me to do, but something I wanted to do for myself."

Vegetarianism,2nazc3,Kittenkajira,3,Mon Nov 24 22:57:52 2014 UTC,I personally would probably skip the dietician until necessary and just find an MD who's on board with veg kids in the first place. Less hassle.

There are tons of meat substitutes out there such as Morning Star and Boca companies. They are delicious alternatives, and are a good source of protein if you are concerned about that. Other than that, everything else is pretty normal. My siblings and I never had any health issues (we were all healthy kids who grew off the percentile charts) so don't let anyone convince you that a vegetarian diet won't give your kids what they need to grow. Also, I would just teach your kids to embrace the life style and advocate for themselves. If they need cheese pizza at a school party, practice with them so that they feel comfortable advocating to teachers and peers about their dietary needs. Lastly, get used to reading labels! Companies find ways to sneak in animal products into the strangest stuff (like kids vitamins for example). Best of luck!"

We were never 'offered the choice' to eat meat, it was never discussed but on the other hand we were always left quite free to do as you wanted. However as kids we've always been very suspicious about food not being prepared by our parents, so that's probably why neither me or my sisters has ever had the impulse to even try to eat meat. Not even as a rebelling teenager. We used to be very very picky about any food though, to the point of not wanting to eat anything for dinner, sitting at the table on your own for hours (literally!) staring at your plate waiting for the problem to solve itself, and getting your unfinished dinner served as breakfast the next morning (only a few times).  Each of us turned out allright though, I and my youngest sister turned around in our teens. My eldest sister didn't do so well until she got a vegan boyfriend who was also a brilliant cook."

If you run into problems with a doctor, I say find a new one. The best part of raising our children as vegetarians so far is the compassion my three year old daughter already shows for animals.

I've seen both of the older brothers experiment with eating meat when they were around 18, but they've both gone back to being vegetarian. The sister is 16 now and has no intention of eating meat. Their household is generally accepting of meat eaters, so I don't think it would be a problem if they started eating meat. In terms of their diet - they usually make a huge thing of some sort of grain that lasts the family for a day or two, and add different vegetables. They aren't the sort of people who ""watch"" their diet, just avoid anything that's junk food. Vegetarianism is really rare in the cultural group we're from, so the entire family gets asked about it a lot. The kids usually just say they grew up vegetarian and aren't used to eating meat.

It helps if you can cook well at home, my mum knew my favourites and would cook them every once in a while, I basically loved all her cooking and everything she makes to this day.  I am not going to lie, being a vegetarian can be quite tough at times especially in some schools where there is only vegetarian meal available but it helps if you can eat most vegetarian things (you can't afford to be selective as a vegetarian). After school it gets easier as you can eat out at restaurants more often and even start cooking at home (simple vegetarian meals are healthy and nutritious and better for the planet).   Any regrets? None! I think I will be a vegetarian till I die. Anything I would like to change- yes, I don't have enough raw food (fruits, dry fruits and seeds)- something around 40% diet should be raw and I am only lately trying to do this.

They added a few items to the salad bar and even kept tofu on hand that, while not on the official menu, one could order in just about anything. I ended up adding tofu to dishes like pasta, stir-fry, pizza, and nachos. They also started carrying vegan cookies from the Alternative Baking Company, which turned out to be a hit with the non-vegan students.  I made myself peanut butter and jelly sandwiches often as well. The bread was like 25 cents a slice and peanut butter and jelly packets were included.

If they don't have information online regarding their vegan options then I would be very concerned.  It's 2014, most higher ed schools should be on top of this by now, but it will depend on the school anyway.  If they don't have a vegan program, then you should try to see if you can be allowed a dietary allowance not to have a meal plan.

Because all of the animals at Farm Sanctuary have been rescued from situations of cruelty, abuse, and neglect, many of them have special care needs, including costly veterinary expenses. Since it is often too costly for one person to fund the care of a special needs animal, we must provide for many of these needy individuals with the help of multiple generous sponsors like you. As a sponsor, your contribution not only provides for your adopted friend but it also goes into a general fund that works to protect all farm animals through Farm Sanctuary’s rescue, education, and advocacy efforts.

When you do go to cook them, then add in any flavorings, like salt, onion and garlic powder(mine and my step-moms favorite flavorings for them). A regular size bag of pinto beans will make you pounds of beans to last for days at super cheap prices, on average about $2?

I run quite a lot of miles a week and don't get but about 30gs of protein a day. So I wouldn't stress it. (Yes I know we're all different but we don't need huge amounts of protein to build muscle or get through the day)  I also want to add that as I look at people's suggestion its occurred to me that simple carbs and soy fill up most protein sources. Both of these are equally bad for you regardless. I know people may not want to hear the preaching but i thought vegetarianism/veganism wasn't about JUST dropping meat and animal products. What I still believe to this day is that no animal product based diets are a result of wanting to be nutritionally improved. Removing unhelpful foods like meat. Substituting animal products with actual food that fortify our health and strength and vitality.

Is an egg derived from a plant source? Nope.  So how could an egg be a 'proponent of' vegetal things?

A Vegetarian can maintain a plant based diet, but still be indifferent to 'the cause' as they purchase leather belts, Adidas Sambas, cars with a leather interior, etc.  By comparison, a Vegan is going to eschew products derived from the exploitation of animals as much as possible or as much as they are aware.  There's a bit of discourse in the community and individual decision making involved in some aspects of life such as the development of vaccines and animals that were involved in their derivation, but many Vegans tend to accept this as part of a greater good in that many lives can be saved for the few that were killed/maimed.

Does that mean eggs are not vegetarian? I was just wondering, and looking for insight. Sorry if this is a stupid question.   There is nothing wrong with the egg.  Normally a small percent of eggs will have little flaws like this.  The big egg companies sort eggs by size and try to filter out any thing that looks a little different.      You may see it on real farm fresh (not factory farmed) eggs.  Or you may see slightly different shell color or texture. Occasionally my mother's one hen will make one that's really oblong or has a little wrinkle in the shell.     All eggs are vegetarian.

In fact, the lives-per-calories cost of eggs is so many times higher than that of beef that even a small amount of eggs outweighs the life cost of a larger amount of beef. So, for example, let’s say you’re a vegetarian and you go out to lunch with your omnivorous friend, where he orders a burger and you order an egg-salad sandwich. The two eggs in your sandwich are only 150 calories, compared to the 300 calories in his beef patty, but the eggs cost almost 9 times as much life as the beef.   http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/2011/08/11/want-to-kill-fewer-animals-give-up-eggs-not-meat/  That means more animals are killed (per cal) by egg consumption than by directly eating beef, pork, etc.  If you want eggs that don't even have proverbial blood, if you have the means to adopt a couple of rescue chickens (not purchased chickens) then no animals are harmed."

Most likely your neighbor bought the chickens from a farm supply store or got them from an acquaintance that was breeding them.  Both options result in massive killing of chickens.  If you found a blood spot in an egg that means the egg was fertilized and so your neighbor has a rooster?  This means there is also chicken breeding most likely occurring.

We like made them into this milk machine by keeping them pregnant. And the majority of our vegetation goes to feed the cows. We could have more veggies in the market. And because they have to have a calf to produce milk, it causes more animals to be killed, because well if they don't produce milk they use them for something else. But all I know about the eggs is that they are in tight cages and if there is a chick in the egg they discard it.  I guess this wikipedia article touches on dairy farming."

It seems to say that the amount of eggs a chicken produces in its life time, doesn't equal the amount of meat you get from killing one cow. The chicken isn't actually dying from laying eggs*. Unless I am missing something, no one is killing chickens to get eggs.  *not saying that some of the conditions chickens are kept in aren't as bad as death, but just that this article is very misleading.   edit: just read the asterisk about male chicks being killed. Still they are counting 1 life as 2. Still this doesn't make the numbers much better. They need to Jurassic Park them chicks!"
Vegetarianism,2m6jj3,hannah81,1 point,Thu Dec 4 07:57:13 2014 UTC,"I am not sure what you mean as one life as two.  Chickens are absolutely killed to produce eggs.   100% of chickens laying eggs are killed, usually after only a year or two. New chickens are constantly produced to lay eggs.  For every one born, a male is born that is killed as a chick.    I am also not sure how this relates to your cow comparison.  To get equal calories to a cow, many, many more chickens are killed.  Jurassic parking them wouldn't help, you would still have an equal number of males born and the layers would still be killed."
Vegetarianism,2m6jj3,janewashington,1 point,Thu Dec 4 11:36:14 2014 UTC,Are they killed for meat? Or just killed? That's what I meant as 1 for 2. The male is killed and they counted it as the male and female were both killed. Unless the female is also killed (and not for meat). If she is killed for meat that is a different problem. Because she wasn't killed for eggs. And hte meat wasn't counted into the figure.   I meat Jurassic park them in the sense of making them all born females. That way there would be no male to kill.

I dare anyone to point it out on the major subreddits - instant  declaration of all-out internet hostilities would ensue :-)  EDIT:  Just putting this here fwiw:  One of the most inspirational scientists to ever live, Carl Sagan would have been 80 years old today. Sagan & Druyan on animals, exploitation and suffering.  “Philosophers of marauding high-technology civilizations have often argued that humans deserve a category distinct from and above all the other animals. It is not enough that humans have a different assortment of the qualities evident in the other animals – more of some traits, fewer of others. A radical difference in kind, not some fuzzy-edged difference in degree, is needed, longed for, sought…  Almost all of them believed that our distinction arises from something made neither of matter nor of energy that resides within the bodies of humans, but of no one else on Earth. No scientific evidence for such a ‘something’ has ever been produced. Only a few of the great Western philosophers – David Hume, for instance – argued, as Darwin did, that the differences between our species and others were only of degree.  … What can we learn about ourselves from an apparent error so widespread, propagated by so many leading philosophers and scientists, both ancient and modern, and with such assurance and self-satisfaction?  One of several possible answers: A sharp distinction between humans and ‘animals’ is essential if we are to bend them to our will, make them work for us, wear them, eat them – without any disquieting tinges of guilt or regret. With untroubled consciences, we can render whole species extinct, for our perceived short-term benefit, or even through simple carelessness. Their loss is of little import: Those beings, we tell ourselves, are not like us. An unbridgeable gap has thus a practical role to play beyond the mere stroking of human egos. Darwin’s formulation of this answer was: Animals whom we have made our slaves, we do not like to consider our equals.“  … Humans – who enslave, castrate, experiment on, and fillet other animals – have had an understandable penchant for pretending that animals do not feel pain. On whether we should grant some modicum of rights to other animals, the philosopher Jeremy Bentham stressed that the question was not how smart they are, but how much torment they can feel…  From all criteria available to us – the recognizable agony in the cries of wounded animals, for example, including those who usually utter hardly a sound – this question seems moot. The limbic system in the human brain, known to be responsible for much of the richness of our emotional life, is prominent throughout the mammals. The same drugs that alleviate suffering in humans mitigate the cries and other signs of pain in many other animals. It is unseemly of us, who often behave so unfeelingly toward other animals, to contend that only humans can suffer.”  —Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors (1992). Carl Sagan & Ann Druyan. Chapter 19, What Is Human?"

A few more thoughts:   I'm attempting to make the changes to go vegan so I have an interest in both.   Then you might want to either wait to see if it sticks, or just start with a vegan blog from the start. The reason being, if the angle of the blog is going to be your journey from vegetarian to vegan, you’ll paint yourself into a corner. (given that sooner or later, there will need to be a conclusion: you either became a vegan, or you decide it isn’t for you.)   Because as a man I can tell you that once I tell people I'm a vegetarian 90% of people immediately ask why my wife made me give up meat.   I’m male and I’ve never had anyone ask me that. But let’s assume that that’s a common question that most male vegans recognize, where will you go with an observation like that? Will you be writing about women a lot? What kind of valuable gender-specific information will I find on your blog that isn’t available on other health and veggie blogs?   a stand up comedian, so my world view is a little different than most.   I don’t understand completely. Normally, one becomes a stand-up comedian because their world view is different from most, not the other way around. What makes your world view different from most?

If other people don't like it, then they shouldn't read it. Having a blog for me isn't about obtaining maximum viewership, but rather about having a place where I can go back and see what was going on in my life at a certain time. Or even better, find the recipe for a dish I made one time three months ago and suddenly crave again. Blogs aren't always about monetization. A lot of bloggers just blog for the sake of writing ideas down and helping others.   Why write for both vegetarians and vegans? Those two groups have very different motivations, needs, and interests.   Your perspective is a little too black or white. There are numerous reasons even within the vegan community to become vegan. I know some people who are vegan for health only, others for ethics, and yet another person who simply does not like meat or dairy. The same variety of reasons run around the vegetarian community, too. The most obvious error here, though, is you're acting like it is a completely two way street. The vegetarian community can eat anything, wear anything, and partake in anything vegans can. A vegan blog would attract plenty of vegetarians who would have plenty of use for its contents. Vegans are still fairly likely to read it, and just ignore the vegetarian components."

Of course, but I got the impression that OP wanted to make a business out of it. He confirmed that in his reply.   There are numerous reasons even within the vegan community to become vegan.    That is incorrect. Veganism is an ideology. As such, all vegans are united by the same main idea: “veganism seeks to exclude all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose.” As individuals, vegans may also care about health or the environment, but that doesn’t describe veganism.  In the words of the Vegan Society, inventors of veganism:  “One may become a vegetarian for a variety of reasons - humanitarian, health, or mere preference for such a diet; The principle is a smatter of personal feeling, and varies accordingly. Veganism, however, is a principle - that man has no right to exploit the creatures for his own ends - and no variation occurs.”   A vegan blog would attract plenty of vegetarians who would have plenty of use for its contents.   Sure, it attracts vegetarians who subscribe to the ideas of veganism. And there are quite a few of those people; they agree with the philosophy, they just don’t want to give up their comforts."

Over and over again, they present a situation and imply that there is only one alternative, when there could be many. The implied alternative is even worse than the current situation, of course.

It's not even killing animals that a lot of vegetarians are against, it's the slaughter of animals for consumption when there is no nutritional requirement to do so.  Whether or not people are vegetarian or vegan is a choice they make themselves based on their own values, but to say vegetarianism is flawed from a moral perspective is incorrect."

Vegetarianism,2lknkd,existentialdude,2,Fri Nov 7 14:31:48 2014 UTC,"Specifically, the part of the article that mentions 70% of cattle killed in Australia - first of all, is that even the majority of beef eaten in Australia?  If not, then the point is irrelevant.  Secondly, that clearly doesn't work for most of the world. And it wouldn't work for Australia if their population was larger and still wanted to eat as much beef.  I will agree that it's widely accepted that free range meat is the 'least deaths per calorie' as long as you're talking about eating animal products.  It's certainly a lot better than chicken or eggs.  I've heard similar arguments to this before, regarding the mice killed while harvesting.  Obviously that argument can't stand given how much grain is needed to raise animals in a factory farm.  Comparing it to grazing is interesting and I hadn't heard the part about animals killed by pesticides.  I actually think it's an interesting point.  Raising the spectre of environmental concerns against grazing is irrelevant to me.  My reasons for vegetarianism is only about the pain and suffering caused to animals.  I don't really care that much about the environment (relative to animal welfare), because saving the environment is very anthropocentric.   I haven't checked his numbers, but if this was true, I would pretty seriously consider it a rational reason not to be vegetarian.  I'm not making the change anytime soon, but it is food for thought.

Vegetarianism,2lknkd,Zyclunt,2,Fri Nov 7 16:01:03 2014 UTC,"Published figures suggest that, in Australia, producing wheat and other grains results in:  at least 25 times more sentient animals being killed per kilogram of useable protein   I would ask to see the source to that because I don't think you can get a reliable number.   How many wild animals were exterminated to put beef cattle out on pasture?   How many large herbivores continue to be culled to protect the plants for cattle to eat?  How about the water supplies that are drained or fenced in for cattle, leaving local wildlife to die of thirst?  In the us,  even range raised cattle are ""finished"" by being put in a feedlot and fed grain.   If it takes many times as many pounds of grain to produce a pound of meat, what's the death toll?  What about the beef that's a side product of dairy?   Dairy aren't grass fed.    Agriculture to produce wheat, rice and pulses requires clear-felling native vegetation.   You mean to tell me absolutely no Australian cattle get grain. I call baloney.  Most of Australia’s arable land is already in use. If more Australians want their nutritional needs to be met by plants, our arable land will need to be even more intensely farmed.   A quick check on Google reveals factory farming is quite popular in Australia.  Factory farms do not use grasslands. They compete with people for grains and soy.    Or, if existing laws are changed, more native vegetation could be cleared for agriculture (an area the size of Victoria plus Tasmania would be needed to produce the additional amount of plant-based food required).   That ignores the plant based food given to factory farmed livestock or that the food Australians eat doesn't necessarily have to be grown locally.   If the author was that worried about death of animals,  he'd be just as worried at the widespread destruction of ecosystems on grasslands.   Just because the soil isn't tilled doesn't mean mother nature is intact."
Vegetarianism,2lknkd,Lz_erk,2,Fri Nov 7 23:40:48 2014 UTC,"Agriculture to produce wheat, rice and pulses requires clear-felling native vegetation.    Also the chances are that people aren't clear-felling remote Tasmanian forests to grow lentils on. This isn't the Brazilian amazon we're talking about. Most farmland in Australia and the US (amongst most other developed countries) was land which had been clear cut etc. and turned into farmland generations ago.    Most of Australia’s arable land is already in use. If more Australians want their nutritional needs to be met by plants, our arable land will need to be even more intensely farmed.     Actually this is wrong. The protein conversion ratio of grains/legumes to meat protein is really inefficient, where as 1 gram of protein from lentils = 1 gram of protein consumed when eaten directly.  I'd love to know what assumptions this person is making about which plants are to be used for the nutritional needs - are we talking things like quinoa, chia, moringa and other foods high in nutrition and suited to more arid conditions, or are we going by white flour and white rice here?  Fuck this bullshit. It's just a cheap attempt at projecting guilt on to people who are actually trying to make a difference.  Don't get me wrong, I totally agree that switching to a vegetarian diet isn't enough to save the world, but at least it's a start.  And don't tell me that intensively-farmed chickens, battery eggs, and sow stalls are equivalent to the quick death of a mouse which was minced instantly because it got caught in a harvesting combine."

Vegetarianism,2jjvkf,Buffalo__Buffalo,7,Sat Oct 18 01:40:27 2014 UTC,"The reason I became a vegetarian was because I saw this video that depicts actual slaughterhouses and it's even worse than that scene from The Walking Dead (that episode was pretty awesome, though). I had the same realization, ""I can't condone this being done to animals"", and I was (and have been ever since) a vegetarian less than two weeks after that (~12 years ago). I thought it was going to be hard to be a vegetarian and I'd always thought it would be too hard to give up meat, but I was absolute in my moral decision, the pain and suffering that any animal had to endure to make it to my plate was simply unacceptable to me, so I knew continuing to eat meat was no longer an option for me.   It ended up being easier than I ever imagined.   To make the transition easier, just about everything that you currently eat that's meat has a vegetarian version. Morningstar Farms has some really tasty stuff: Hamburgers, hot dogs, spicy buffalo chicken wings, chicken breasts, bacon, ground beef (especially great for making tacos/burritos). There's even Tofurky for Thanksgiving. But one of my favorite dishes is Eggplant parmesan. There's a whole world of food out there not involving meat that's just waiting for you to try. Indian vegetable curry. Chinese vegetable dumplings."

Actually, the scene had me thinking of the animals too and the terror that they feel prior to slaughter. :(  When I decided to go cold tofurky on meat, I was so scared of failing that I absolutely stuffed myself with insane amounts of beans and fatty plant foods like avocados. And it worked. I was full all the time and ...weirdly, I dropped some excess weight without trying. This coming from someone who struggled for years to lose weight without success.  My advice is to get excited about trying high-protein plant foods like beans, lentils, tofu, seitan (HAIL SEITAN!!) and, heck, even ""faux meat"" products. Look up recipes and experiment. Make sure you are eating enough calories so you don't have to deal with making poor choices when you're too hungry.   Good luck!"

You could start by cutting your meat intake in two, or by only eating meat that comes from nicer sources. Becoming a pescatarian (fish only) is also an option.   If you want to go completely vegetarian, your low sugar intake really won't be too big of an issue. Replace all meat in your diet with tofu, lentils, beans, eggs, dairy, seitan, etc. There are a lot of healthy options that are low in sugar and vegetarian. All it takes is a little research. :)"

We can agree or disagree with each other, but at the end of the day you're the one who looks yourself in the mirror before going to bed. The important thing is whether or not you think that what you did falls in line with the ethics you want to live by. If so, I hope you enjoyed your pizza. If not, I still hope you enjoyed your pizza and that you learned something about yourself.  FWIW, a pepperoni pizza is still going to have meat juices on it even after you've picked off the pepperoni. Removing the meat is more of a symbolic gesture than a method of converting the pizza to a meat-free option. On the other hand, the only thing worse than killing animal and eating it is killing an animal and then throwing the meat away - it's an insulting waste. I endorse an ethical code that says if you are hungry and the choice is to put the free pizza in your mouth or throw it in the trash, putting it in your mouth is the better choice.  If the literal scenario was that someone was throwing out pizza and I was hungry, I would take the pizza and eat it, pepperoni and all, but take pains to not let anyone seeing me eat the meat to avoid giving the impression that I endorse purchasing and eating meat. I hope this makes sense, but I suspect my stance on this may come off as me not being serious about being vegetarian."

To me, if you've already killed the animal don't insult its life by putting it in the trash, I'd rather honour its life by eating it (if I am hungry). But I have vegetarian and non-vegetarian friends who either think this is 'wrong' or 'not proper vegetarianism'.

Cheese can be made with or without rennet which is derived from the stomach tissue of a slaughtered calf. This list specifies those cheeses which are made without the use of rennet.    http://cheese.joyousliving.com/  It is just usually one of those things that are ignored, like gelatin in frosted mini-wheats and marshmallows or fish bladder used for Guinness.

I make the emphasis on eating vegetables and when I serve non vegetarian friends I tell them about the merits of the vegetables included, not about the reasons I omit the bad stuff. For this reason I also like to avoid meat substitutes because they're just gross.  Long ingredient lists are very scary to me.    Good luck, OP.  Glad to see you aren't one to try and replace meat with a sad substitute."

Hell, I used to go to kaiten-sushi and manage to eat vegetarian (vege tempura, nasu, corn-mayo, natto, etc).

I wouldn't say it's that difficult, but I do make compromises, the biggest one being that I almost never eat out, and when I do I usually eat beforehand.   Vegetables certainly aren't cheap, but I haven't found them to be much more expensive than Australia on the whole. The general advice is the same as it is in most places: buy stuff that's in season, and if you want to buy stuff that isn't, by it frozen.  Farming in Japan is very different to how it is in most western countries. What most Australians would consider a large veggie patch is often a commercial farm, and there are a lot of these in the middle of cities. The same goes for rice, there are rice paddies all over the city in which I live. This small scale farming does go some of the way to explaining why veggies are so expensive, but it isn't right to say that there isn't a lot of farming here. Further, it's important to realise that the shinkansen travels through the more heavily populated parts of the country.  All that being said, I agree that veg*nism is pretty difficult here, but if it's important enough to you (and you have somewhere to cook) it's not impossible."

Vegetarianism,2hcrsr,franco_man,16,Wed Sep 24 18:40:40 2014 UTC,"I'm a college student in my 4th year and have just transitioned into veganism a few months ago but have been vegetarian for over a year. Being vegetarian/vegan is a lot more inexpensive than eating meat, in my opinion. A block of tofu is ~$4 and usually lasts me for two meals while a pack of meat is anywhere from $7-$12 and doesn't keep for as long.  That being said here is what I would recommend for a low budget vegetarian diet: - Canned beans. They're great for adding to salads and chili. If you want to make a really good vegetarian chili buy a few different types of beans, a large can of crushed tomatoes and a can of tomato paste. Add all the ingredients in a large pot and season and let simmer for 45 minutes and boom. It makes about 6 servings, is extremely filling, full of protein, and only cost you about $6. - Tofu. I usually buy a block per week and dice it up to go with whatever vegetables I'm making for dinner. Make sure you press the water out before you cook it, I don't really recommend marinating tofu because I think it gets too squishy but you can make some reaaaally good fried tofu by tossing it in some almond milk and then a flour/corn starch mixture and letting it simmer in vegetable oil for a while. - Vegetables. I'm not sure if you have access to a farmers market but if you do check it out! Vegetables there are usually a lot cheaper than grocery stores and tend to taste a lot better. A main thing I've learned from being vegetarian/vegan is to shop for vegetables in small increments (going grocery shopping once a week rather than every other week). You'll use up all your veggies before they go bad if you buy in smaller quantities. My key vegetables I always get are kale (sautéed or to make kale chips), asparagus, potatoes, cherry tomatoes and mushrooms. - Boxed things. Buy some pasta and rice. It's cheap and you can make a bunch of different dishes with all the vegetables you have!  All in all being vegetarian is very simple and cheap. If you're not loading up on morning star and other fake meats you'll really see a difference in how much you pay for groceries now that meat is not a part of your diet. PM me if you have any questions or want any recipe ideas!"
Vegetarianism,2hcrsr,ratbelly,6,Wed Sep 24 19:50:37 2014 UTC,"This ^ is solid advice. I'd also 2nd staying away from the fake meats at least for a little while. Not only is it good for your budget, but I think it's helpful for new vegetarians to let their taste buds ""detox"". That way when you learn how to do things like make tofu bacon you're likely to be really satisfied, because after your detox, it really will taste like bacon! (And that was exciting to me when I did it! haha)  I'd also tell you to invest in a decent array of spices. Things like curry, cayenne, basil, cumin, chili powder, garlic salt, etc. Flavorful food is satisfying food."

Vegetarianism,2hcrsr,Exhibizionism,2,Thu Sep 25 15:31:48 2014 UTC,"I would too, but it does add an extra layer of complexity to cooking. Canned beans are half water, and the beans themselves must double in weight compared to their dried counterparts - at the very least.  The problem is that dried beans need to be soaked and cooked first, or otherwise you need a pressure cooker or instead a slow cooker and a lot of forward-planning (side note: do you need to boil your beans to denature their haemagglutinin content? If you aren't sure then you should be boiling any beans for a minimum of 10 minutes to be safe - slow cookers won't reach boiling temperature).  Having some canned beans on hand is useful in a pinch or in a bout of laziness, but it's also a really good lead in to learning about beans without having it becoming too burdensome for a beginner."
Vegetarianism,2hcrsr,Buffalo__Buffalo,6,Thu Sep 25 17:32:13 2014 UTC,"A good place to start for you might be The Starving Students' Vegetarian Cookbook which has a lot of very ""normal"" and easy to make food containing easily obtainable ingredients. It isn't the healthiest cookbook ever, but for someone who is poor and trying to go vegetarian it's a good way to ease into it without having to subsist on fried food and cheese or learn how to make a bunch of weird new food.  And that's the thing:  You don't have to completely overhaul your diet all at once. I think a lot of people look at all the options out there and get overwhelmed and discouraged. If seitan and tempeh and quinoa and amaranth sound weird and confusing to you then don't pressure yourself to start using them all at once. First figure out how to make a decent cup of rice and steamed veggies, then learn to read the labels of meat substitutes and compare them to make sure you are getting enough protein for your money. Hint: 4 grams of protein for a burger patty is not a meat ""substitute""; it's a light snack.  All the weird food can come later when you feel more confident and want to branch out."
Vegetarianism,2hcrsr,TeaMistress,3,Wed Sep 24 20:54:51 2014 UTC,"I actually find that eating vegetarian is cheaper, but you have to be aware of what you're buying and what you're actually eating on a weekly basis.  Things that can make your diet expensive are brand names, boxed snacks and treats (ie crackers, cookies), cheese (if you use it for a lot of things; poor value for how much you get and it doesn't really check any hunger boxes per se), premade/ready to eat foods, and poor planning.  Of course, it also depends on where you live - I study in the UK and made the last leap to become a full-on vegetarian when I landed last year.  School is obviously expensive so I really cracked down and analysed how I ate and how I could improve, health-wise and financially.  I realised I used butter and olive oil for the same things, so I stuck to olive oil because I got more bang for my buck.  I was pleasantly surprised when I could get a kg of store brand potatoes for 69p, or about a dollar and thirteen cents, but that's probably because they're not grown very far away.  I'd boil some and then keep them in the fridge to pull out for a quick lunch, or I'd cube and roast them with some carrots and steamed rice for dinner.  I found cheese to be more expensive; a small bag can run £3, or $4.90.  I realised it was a luxury item as opposed to a nutrition and nourishment item, so I learned to live without it (and now I find that I feel heavy when I eat too much of it, but that's another story).    I think the key is having basics, a good spice rack, and the drive to experiment.  I usually have things like onions, potatoes, mushrooms, rice, pasta, tomatoes, bread, canned beans, bananas, mandarin oranges, pears, oatmeal, spinach, couscous, things like that.  Instead of buying jarred pasta sauce, I buy canned tomatoes and tomato paste and add my own seasonings.  I also like to keep around frozen veggies like broccoli and peas and things like that because they're really easy to toss into pasta or rice.   You need to be open to a bit of cooking and aware of the versatility of the items you buy, but seasoning and different preparation methods can do wonders."
Vegetarianism,2hcrsr,cocoalrose,3,Wed Sep 24 23:20:38 2014 UTC,"Indians cuisine has a huge array of delicious dishes which are vegetarian. Simple red lentil curries or potato curries are really cheap and really tasty, and if you are looking for a place to start then I cannot recommend learning to cook Indian food enough.  That being said, a lot of Chinese dishes also lend themselves well to being meat-free. A simple dish of vegetables in black bean sauce or garlic sauce is quick and easy - and probably more so than most Indian dishes, especially if you are familiar with East Asian cooking.  But honestly, it's worth learning to make a few basic lentil curries - they are so cheap and healthy, they provide lots of protein, and they give you that feeling satiety that lots of meat-eaters miss when eating light vegetarian dishes so it's a good way to aid the transition.  Speaking of transition - make it a gradual transition. Phase meat out bit by bit. Find new vegetarian recipes that you like, learn to reverse engineer your favorite meat dishes into a vegetarian option. Learn to use legumes, tofu, and TVP. Try making it not about abstaining or forcing yourself, but about shifting your lifestyle away from what it is and closer to what you want it to be."

Myself, I have a weakness for vegan pizza, and I indulge myself on that pretty much whenever I feel like it.

Vegetarianism,2hcrsr,Kimberlyrenee,2,Wed Sep 24 23:37:00 2014 UTC,"I am also a poor college student, however, I've found cutting out meat has actually saved me money. There have already been some really excellent suggestions on this post but I would just add: think about foods you used to eat and figure out ways to make them vegetarian. One thing I noticed when I first went veg was that I felt like I needed a new repertoire of recipes. And while I've discovered some awesome new recipes, there are many ways to adapt recipes you're already comfortable with.   For example, I've been making burritos for lunch. At the beginning of the week, I prep salsa (1 - 2 tomatoes, chopped red onion, cilantro, salt, cayenne pepper, and lime), sauteed red onion and green bell pepper with fajita seasoning, black beans, avocado, and queso fresca. I make white rice when I'm ready to assemble everything.  All of those vegetable items together really don't cost that much. When you go shopping, don't refrain from grabbing all kinds of vegetables. If you wanted to sub the recipe above for tacos instead, for example, grab a head of cauliflower, chop it up, coat it in oil, and toss it in a packet of taco seasoning, roast at 375 degrees (F) for about 30-45 mins. Bam. Deliciousness.   When I went veg, the hardest meat product to let go (for me) was sausage. However, I found that Morning Star Breakfast Sausage Patties were pretty damn near close to the real thing (almost...) and that made that particular craving a whole lot easier to deal with."

Check out the section in the freezer sections and just sub out what you normally eat.  E.g., Ground beef crumbles for spaghetti sauce, Morning Star burgers, Tofurkey brand deli ""meats"" for sandwiches, Quorn chicken cutlets for anything that uses chicken breasts.

Eventually I started playing music with two awesome persons, a vegan and a vegetarian that were very accepting of my eating habits. I hung out with them, saw what they ate and thought ""Hey, if they can do it, so do I"" so I decided to try a week off meat and recapitulate after it. A week was a great goal since it was short enough to be a huge power of will failure if I failed, and long enough to get an idea of how being a vegetarian is. Not much to say about that, my one week goal turned into a one month goal, the one month goal turned into a one year goal, and now here I am 3 years after that."

But I noticed I still struggled to recover after eating big meat meals, even though it was ""clean"" whole foods.  I just kept reducing the amount of meat I ate and kept recovering faster.  I eat mostly raw during the day now with cooked foods for dinner.  I lost a lot of weight, feel great, have signs of great health (BP, resting HR, cholesterol, etc).   The results allowed me to make the change and I have since managed to see how entrenched the ""meat industry"" is in our culture and the extreme levels they go to sell to us.  Previously, someone could have showed me the moral issues and it wouldn't have mattered to me, getting rid of meat wasn't something I could even consider.

I then had some really bad meat experiences which pushed me closer. Eventually I started dating a vegetarian girl and that gave me all the legitimacy I needed to make the switch. It's 8 years later, the girl and I are married, and I LOVE vegetarian cooking and eating more than ever.  I mainly do it because I see vegan cooking as its own cuisine. Like how some people talk about French or Italian cuisine, that's how I talk about vegan cuisine. Isa Chandra Moskowitz is my culinary hero. The flavors I get in vegan dishes are complex and usually not found in meat dishes. I also have environmental concerns about meat production that seals the deal. I have also never killed an animal and can't stand the thought of someone doing it on my behalf.   But mostly it's because vegan food is tastier than meat."

That wasn't a good enough reason for me to start. I'm already 6'1"", 200 lbs, and reasonably strong, so the nutrition arguments never held any water for me either.  As humans, we judge ourselves based on how compassionate we are. That is why most modern industrialized societies have extensive social systems to help care for those who cannot care for themselves.

Often it is said that plants do seem to be conscious but this is simply a misunderstanding of their purely chemical ability to communicate. Should it be discovered that plants are suffering for the sake of human consumption, I'd imagine we'd try to seek out a better source of energy.  This is of course only true for those of us who place the morality aspect over the health aspect.  There's tons more information around the subs, definately check it out!

As far as our knowledge currently extends, I think it's safe to say the animals suffer more than the plants when their lives are taken for our consumption.

Hemp milk is a decent second place.  Almond milk and coconut milk have much less protein than cow's milk or soy milk.  The other nutrients are largely supplemental (that is, they are added to the milk), so you may consider balancing your child's diet in other ways to maximize their intake of calcium and vitamin D, both of which are very important.

Vegetarianism,2ggbpo,MaysBillyHere,3,Mon Sep 15 14:51:21 2014 UTC,As a baby I was allergic to cow's milk so I got soy milk formula (Soyalac) as well as breast milk. I'm 59 and I still drink soy milk.
Vegetarianism,2ggbpo,GetOffMyLawn_,2,Wed Sep 24 23:38:49 2014 UTC,"If she's breastfeeding, the WHO recommendation is to continue that until at least 2. For some reason in some cultures (mine included) there is this huge push to get baby off breastmilk/formula as fast as possible.   But other than convenience, there's no need to rush weaning.  As baby finally switches over more to solid foods, why not offer non dairy milks?"
Vegetarianism,2ggbpo,funchy,4,Mon Sep 15 22:13:24 2014 UTC,"well, alternatives to cow's milk could be soy or almond. My suggestion would be almond milk though, or maybe even coconut milk. I've learned in university that soy milk is pretty damaging (in large quantities) to babies/children/teens with active hormones. Soy is technically an endocrine disruptor - which basically means that it mimics the shapes of our hormones and takes their place in our receptors, intercepting messages."
Vegetarianism,2ggbpo,misskenzer,2,Mon Sep 15 12:46:42 2014 UTC,"This. My twins have been drinking almond milk for over a year and have no ill effects. They eat more protein in their foods since the milk lacks it. They're growth rates are both on track and they're up to date and advanced on some of their skill sets, so brain development seems to be fine. We also dodge soy based proteins due to the hormonal issue."
Vegetarianism,2ggbpo,PreposterousMurmur,2,Mon Sep 15 22:42:20 2014 UTC,"I think /u/trashed_culture gave you a great answer here. I just want to add that if you opt to feed your baby soymilk you should keep an eye out for signs of intolerance. It's not unusual for young children to be sensitive to soy, which many do eventually grow out of. Several vegetarian friends of mine found that at least one of their children had issues with soy as babies. Note:  If your wife eats soy now and there haven't been any adverse reactions from her breast milk there probably won't be an issue, but be watchful just in case."

Vegetarianism,2g2b4r,awb8789,7,Thu Sep 11 01:44:11 2014 UTC,"Fish is very nutritious, and as a source of meat, is much better than mammals/birds--lots of great oils, lean meat, etc. Out of all the meat out there, fish is probably the best for you. I was also a pescatarian for a few years before becoming vegetarian--and eventually vegan--for this reason.  I could go ahead and make arguments as to why you can be just as healthy (if not more healthy) as a veg*n, and if you'd like this sort of information, I'd encourage you to visit http://veganhealth.org/. It's a great site for learning about all of the health aspects of a plant-based diet (you want to know about fish, so I'd suggest looking at the Omega-3 section, for example). Also, protein deficiency really is not something to worry about, especially if you are considering vegetarianism as opposed to veganism. You still have dairy and eggs, which can provide way more than enough protein. When I was a vegetarian, I would usually have 2 eggs for breakfast and then whatever dairy I would consume throughout the day, and I never had an issue with protein.  That being said, the reason I won't go deeper into the health arguments is because it sounds like the reason you want to become a veg*n is ethical in nature. Do you think eating a fish is wrong? Then you shouldn't do it. End of discussion. You're not going to die early because you didn't eat fish--and even if you did (which you wont), would you rather live an extra few years in your 80s/90s, or live those years doing the right thing?   You also say you're trying to convince your girlfriend. What do you mean?"
Vegetarianism,2g2b4r,loopsonflowers,3,Thu Sep 11 02:46:44 2014 UTC,"We live together and do our grocery shopping together and I cook just about everything, so any decision I make in this department will in some way effect her. I want to be able to convince her that it is a healthier option, I was initially going to just go straight to vegetarian but she convinced me otherwise (protein arguments and some things I now know to be false).  Also my ethical issue isn't so much with eating animals, circle of life and all that, eating animals is not really my issue. It's Tyson, the treatment of animals that are raised for slaughter and the whole industry around that I find unethical. So wild caught fish was a bit of a loophole.  This being said, that was what prompted me to start looking into vegetarianism, since then it's become the ""whole foods plant based diet"" as they said in ""Forks Over Knives"" and the health benefits that has renewed my desires to cut fish. Most of the comments were actually also very in favor of vegan and I'd actually like to shoot for that so I appreciate the vegan website. I'm going to go look through that now and I'll comment again if I have follow up questions I couldn't find.   Thank you, I appreciate your time helping me with this."
Vegetarianism,2g2b4r,spicymaki,3,Thu Sep 11 03:55:28 2014 UTC,"Well I think that there are plenty of resources out there that you have to convince her, but at the end of the day, it's a decision she has to come to on her own. While it really isn't that hard to be vegetarian, it still is a lifestyle change, and not a trivial one. It will most definitely take some sort of genuine personal conviction on her part if you plan to have a vegetarian household for an indefinite period of time.   So with that said, I'd start with vegetarian instead of jumping into vegan, especially if your girlfriend needs convincing. I've only recently gone vegan and I'm doing just fine nutritionally, but there are a lot of tough aspects (going out to/ordering out from restaurants, while not impossible, can be pretty difficult with friends).  Importantly, don't beat yourself up if you slip up a few times (or more than a few times)--what matters is what you decide to do after that. I've known many people who try vegetarianism, slip once or twice, and decide ""they just don't have the willpower."" I remember it taking me a good couple of tries (over the course of a few months) to go fully vegetarian, and even now after 5 years there are instances where I mess up. It's going to happen, and when it does, just push forward."

As long as it's well balanced there's nothing to worry about on that front.   Minus points for eating fish are that the current fishing process is not sustainable and it's killing everything (sharks, corals etc) in the water and messing with the natural balance - so if you care about the ethics there's that. Also, fish can contain toxic levels of mercury and other heavy metals as well as radiation (A lot of nuclear waste was/is dumped in the deep sea and leaks out and pollutes the food web). So if it's the health aspect you're most worried about maybe continue eating a few servings of fish a month but be aware that the oceans are really very badly polluted."

A lot of people find that after cutting out/down on meat and eating more vegetables and fruit that they have a lot more energy so you may well have enough energy leftover after work to cook a good meal.  My personal essentials for a plant based cupboard are:    plenty of pulses and grains - Rice, quinoa (very high in protein), lentils etc.  Onions, garlic and potatoes provide flavour and substance to most meals, obviously add other vegetables to get more nutrients - Dark greens (Kale, spinach) often have a lot of iron.  Tinned produce is great, chopped tomatoes, kidney beans, butterbeans and those type of things are great for veggie chilli, chickpeas as well, and the old favourite, baked beans.

Vegetarianism,2ehafd,cdpetey,15,Sun Aug 24 22:49:18 2014 UTC,"That's so awesome you're being supportive and trying to get more information so that he can make a healthy transition.   I became a vegetarian when I was 17, and my husband was raised as a vegetarian from birth. We don't eat eggs, fish, birds, or mammals, but we do drink milk and eat cheese. I'm happy to answer questions and provide assistance.   The protein thing has only really become an issue when my husband has a strenuous weight-lifting regimen. He has long been tall and skinny, too. Does your son exercise heavily? If so, that alters the protein advice. I'll start with basic information:  For moderately active lifestyles (like mine!) protein isn't really an issue. All plant-based food has protein in it, and so does dairy. Actually ""protein"" is composed of multiple constituent parts, called amino acids. Animal products have 100% of those constituent parts, because those animals have collected them from the plants they ate. Some plants have large portions of those constituent parts, and deft combinations can result in easy ""complete"" protein. A whole grain and a bean or legume is the easiest combination, and results in great meals providing complete protein: peanut butter on whole wheat bread; or beans and brown rice; falafel with whole wheat pita; lentil soup and whole wheat toast. Quinoa is a plant that has a complete protein profile on its own. And, if your son is eating dairy, that is a source of complete protein, too.   The real key is eating a variety and appropriate proportion of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, legumes, and plant oils. During the adjustment phase, some new vegetarians have trouble replacing that large source of calories - meat - with other satisfying foods. This results in a tendency to over-eat refined carbohydrates. Keeping on hand some nourishing foods with fat and protein in them will help counteract this. And, you can make smart meal substitutes to help him: Instead of replacing the meat portion of a meal with extra broccoli and rice, try adding in beans or tofu.   I hope this helps get you and your son started!"
Vegetarianism,2ehafd,Kimberlyrenee,11,Mon Aug 25 00:07:28 2014 UTC,"This is one of the most common misconceptions of the Vegetarian diet. It is incredibly difficult to not get enough protein. You would actually have to make an active effort to avoid it. A big thing to keep an eye on is Iron. Make sure he eats plenty of beans (a large source of protein and iron), lentils and vegetables. Don't just make a meal containing meat and leave off the meat, substitute it for something else for example if you make spaghetti bolognase use quinoa or lentils instead of mince meat. Or make a roast, use a side of lentil stew instead of meat or use a fake meat to supplement.   I really only had an issue with gaining weight and being unhealthy when I turned Vegan as I love mashed potato and basically lived off it. Which is pretty much 100% carbs. There is usually not much wrong with fake meats and they are often balanced to be high in Protein and Iron and contain less fat than real meat. It just seems like a lot of fat for vegetarians because the Vegetarian diet does not contain many foods that are high in fat."
Vegetarianism,2ehafd,Suaber,5,Mon Aug 25 00:47:52 2014 UTC,"I have had an issue with getting enough protein. However, that is because I haven't included higher-protein foods in large enough proportion to other foods. Too much sugar, fruit, and refined grains will edge out protein-rich foods. I think it is something people should watch out for, just as when you're shaping any kind of health diet.   Of course, I completely agree that it is a misconception to think it is difficult or impossible to get adequate protein in a veg*n diet."
Vegetarianism,2ehafd,funchy,1 point,Mon Aug 25 02:14:46 2014 UTC,"Honestly, I have found it hard to do on a low budget.    As i get older (50+), I have to eat less grains because the starch/protein ratio is getting too high and it's too many calories for the amount of protein included.  It took a while to get sources that work for me.  I can't tolerate beans and lentils, but it turned out that I can eat a lot of split peas.  I also add a teaspoon of super high protein powder to the split peas.  It is based on soy isolate, and I must avoid less processed soy that has the estrogen mimic (estriol, phytoestrogen?) in it."
Vegetarianism,2ehafd,danhm,6,Wed Aug 27 23:15:23 2014 UTC,I became a vegetarian in my late teens.  I never suffered from any lack of protein.

Vegetarianism,2ehafd,InfiniteHatred,5,Sun Aug 24 23:39:26 2014 UTC,"Be careful that he doesn't rely too much on dairy and eggs for calories and protein. That can lead to low iron because dairy is low iron and eggs have iron inhibitors. This is less of a problem for vegans, actually, because we don't eat any animal products so our primary protein sources tends to be legumes and they are high in iron and protein.   He should also take a B12 supplement. Even a lot of meat eaters should take it because of reduced absorption, but especially vegetarians since dietary B12 is only found in animal products (made by bacteria, though, which can be grown without animal products for the supplements). There is some B12 in eggs and dairy, but it's not enough if he's not eating a lot of those and, as I said, that's not a good idea health-wise.   For calcium, legumes are also good, along with dark leafy greens, nuts and seeds, and some dried herbs and other seasonings. There are also vegan plant milks that are typically fortified with calcium."

Vegetarianism,2ehafd,CosmicLove721,1 point,Mon Aug 25 00:55:01 2014 UTC,"The problem we vegetarians face with iron is that the variety found in plants does not absorb into the body as easily as the variety found in animals. Adding vitamin C can dramatically aid in iron absorption, so he should include some source of it with iron-rich foods. He should avoid consuming these foods with foods that contain significant sources of calcium, zinc, magnesium, and copper, because these compete for absorption.  You can help to address his nutrient issues with otc dietary supplements. Depending on how he feels about animal products in the supplements, you should probably check the labels to determine which he should use."

I have been eating a mainly plant-based diet for about 3 years now.. I am a pretty skinny guy myself so incorporating a lot of the Good fatty acids like avocados, nut & seeds help keep the weight on if needed. Quinoa is also an amazing alternative to rice and is also a complete protein meaning it has all the essential amino acids needed.  Also, its always a great idea to have make smoothies with fruits/berries and some greens (spinach or kale) Then to top if off with some nutrient packed chia seeds or hemp seeds (complete protein)(also has lots of healthy omegas) it's an easy way to make sure your getting everything you need to stay healthy!!

Vegetarianism,2ehafd,murphylawson,4,Mon Aug 25 01:51:48 2014 UTC,"Honestly, as long as he's eating plenty of nuts and beans I wouldn't worry too much about protein.

In general, if one is mindful about not just filling up on pasta and soy substitutes all the time (like I did when I was a teenager), nutrition is not so hard.

But growing crops for 9 billion people isn't sustainable for the animals whose habits are destroyed for these crops. The article may seem to support animals, but it actually speaks a very speciest philosophy. If you are just vegetarian for environmental or logistical reasons, I guess that doesn't matter. But for most vegetarians it should be morally appalling to destroy billions of  animal's habits to feed one species. The only real vegetarian option for human food shortage is to stop making so many humans.   Now to be honest, huge human population decline probably isn't going to happen anytime soon. So yes, using crop land more efficiently will help, but it is still limited and the human population still growing. Which means finding new farm land for humans, when we should be finding ways to give it back to other living beings.  I honestly feel that if humans keep multiplying that there really is no hope for other life on this planet. We consume so much. Outside the realm of scifi, replicators, Terra-forming other planets, or an some mass disaster that wipes out a large portion of man, there really is no solution.

Vegetarianism,2d32z3,ShellLillian,1 point,Sat Aug 9 18:58:30 2014 UTC,"You friend's blog is cool. She really should mention something about Mexican food, though. It is frequently cooked with lard. Lard is fat from slaughtered animals. It is a traditional ingredient in Mexican cuisine and is valued for its flavor. Many Mexican restaurants will not be able to reliably clarify whether they use lard and will even list dishes with lard in them as ""vegetarian.""  I'm a Hindu vegetarian, and I almost never eat at Mexican restaurants unless I find one that is reliable, with whom I can confirm their use of vegetarian cooking oils.   Edit: I'm reading more closely now, and found another issue. She mentioned Panera's French Onion Soup. As you can see on Panera's website, here, that soup includes the water from boiled chicken and cow meat.   Edit2: I'm so sorry, I hate seeming unduly critical. It is just that I'm sure your friend wants to give reliable advice. It looks like she may very well be consuming a lot of meat products without realizing it. Her advice on Thai, Chinese, and Japanese cuisine does not warn about fish sauce or meat-based sauces. She recommends kimchi, which almost always has fish in it.   Eating vegetarian in the U.S. is easy, but there is meat lurking all over the place. Maybe she should look over her selections a little more carefully."

Vegetarianism,2crqu8,username_redacted,11,Wed Aug 6 16:40:31 2014 UTC,"First of all: Congratulations! I'm so glad you're interested in a meat-free diet. You're already used to a restricted diet, so this will be very easy for you. I've been a vegetarian for the past 15 years, and in that time I have been partly a good vegetarian, and mostly a bad one, so learn from my mistakes: Your diet should consist of mostly fresh vegetables, including legumes, root vegetables, and nuts. Grains are fine in moderation, but always look for ""whole grain"" products, without preservatives. Fiber is very essential, and whole grains are great sources fiber and give your body readily available energy. There are a million good recipes at your fingertips that only require Google.  The worst and most widely propagated myth about plant based diets is that you have a protein deficiency: Most vegetables contain protein, some even quit a lot! Beans, lentils, peas, nuts, and mushrooms are the most obvious sources, but most dark green leafy vegetables are also good protein sources as well. Avoid relying too heavily on ""meat replacement"" products, although some of them are quite tasty these days. Get used to looking at ingredient labels, and avoid anything that isn't made out of things that grow in the ground. I eat eggs and cheese sparingly, but am very selective about what I buy.

I had been on and off vegetarian for about 9 years and am overweight.  My boyfriend decided to go paleo back in March and he convinced me to do it too.  I had been steadily losing weight on paleo for about 4 months. By this time I had probably eaten more meat in 4 months than I had in the past two years combined (I usually ate a low meat diet or was in a vegetarian phase).   Then, in early July I went on a vacation with my boyfriend and his family.  His sister had gone vegan a few months ago after being vegetarian for years.  One day his sister and I were talking and I admitted that I had wanted to read ""Eating Animals"" by Jonathon Safran Foer but I had heard that his book will turn you vegetarian.  I also admitted that I had a lot of guilt eating meat while on paleo. She told me, sometimes ignorance is bliss (in the sweetest way possible). This conversation inspired me to educate myself on the meat industry.  I immediately picked up my kindle and downloaded his book.  The first day I read a large portion of the book, but was unswayed. The second day I got through most of the book (while driving home form vacation).  That day I decided to become vegan.  The cruelty that animals have to endure to become our food is not something I can support anymore.   tl;dr read the book ""Eating Animals"" if you want a look into how meat, eggs, and dairy are produced."

If Dr. Attia discovers conclusively that legumes damage the vascular glycocalyx, sparking atherosclerotic conditions, then I might pay more attention to the idea.  Nightshades may or may not be a problem [and I'm unsure if they're prohibited for all Cordain paleo dieters or just those with autoimmune conditions -- but we're in an autoimmune epidemic, so it seems like a good thing to know about]. But this is where I've hit a wall on my ability to understand nutrition; I simply don't have the molecular physics background to understand how intercellular electrical resistance allows particles of what size to enter the bloodstream and cause autoimmunity. Tomatoes are a curious case, and should probably be decided individually; I know someone who seems to benefit greatly from nightshade avoidance, but is testing her tomato tolerance with favorable results.  The carb, protein, and fat calorie balance isn't much of a problem once you've dealt with those issues. Coconuts, avocados, and palm products can supply quite a bit of fat, provided that you like chili and curry [and that you aren't opposed to eating legumes, which are high in protein, fiber, amino acids, etc].  I trust plant saturated fat more than animal saturated fat. If I recall right, myristic and palmitic fats are the ones to avoid, and although coconuts and palms contain these, I decided that they should be acceptable in moderation. Don't trust me though -- if you're concerned, please look them up [I wish I could link some stuff, but I'm in a hurry today, sorry].  [An ecological note on palm oil: watch for RSPO labeling!]  This leaves me with a legume-based dinner and several mostly-vegetable meals during the rest of the day, such as brussel's sprout salads, asparagus with vegannaise aioli, shish kabobs [mushroom, onion, squashes, and the occasional pineapple and sweet potato or yam], and so on.  With that said, I'm technically only a wanna-be vegetarian these days, as I plan on having a beef liver sometime in the next ten days. I'm far from proud, but it's cheap nutrition, and it's basically only a byproduct of the meat industry, so I won't feel too bad about my financial support of the product. I could probably live without it, but there are always extraneous circumstances behind my actions.  It's equally hard to justify my purchase of eggs. The vegan arguments against them seem airtight to me, but what with the innumerable allergies and food restrictions, I get grumpy and sometimes find it hard to care. A spinach quiche is a very compact meal.  I found some ""certified humane"" eggs, and I haven't had time to review their standards [which I expect will turn my stomach, but who knows? no, really, who knows? -- tell me more], but it's an option... maybe a better option than getting grumpy and buying an even less reputable product.  With those unpleasantries aside, do keep an eye out for unsweetened almond milk. I've heard that not everyone likes it, but I think it's delicious [and I've heard it's far cheaper to make your own, which is on my to do list] and certainly worth a shot for its protein and fat.  You may hear vegans and vegetarians imploring you to minimize your harm ASAP, and while they're simply right as far as I can tell, I'm going to advise you to take it slowly. If you plan out your meals and shopping lists carefully, there could be less chance of a ""relapse"" or other problems. If I recall correctly, health concerns are the most commonly stated reasons for vegans to become ex-vegans. Careful vegan dieting has been shown to be perfectly healthy and beneficial [even though some of the more miraculous claims about veganism have been shown to be erroneous], but I think that if you take it slowly, you'll have an advantage against that possible problem.  Supplements:  Vitamin D2   -- ergocalciferol -- is produced either by ""irradiating fungi"" or putting mushrooms in sunlight, depending on who you ask, and I haven't found any studies stating that D2 is unhealthy or unusable. If you're going vegan, look up how to maximize your mushrooms' vitamin D content or consider buying a supplement.  D3, cholecalciferol, is produced from lanolin in sheep wool. As in any other animal industry, some sheep are treated worse than others, and the standards of their care are very hard to verify.  Other vegan supplements to consider include algal B12, which isn't always terribly expensive [maybe try ordering online], iodine, and... er... calcium? Sorry, I'm rusty, but I know I've seen a few good videos [and a few questionable ones] on vegan supplementation on YouTube.  Good luck."

Vegetarianism,2crqu8,Kimberlyrenee,2,Thu Aug 7 01:45:30 2014 UTC,"This will be a controversial thing on this sub reddit but if it is animal welfare you care about you could always just switch to ethical meats. There are usually great local ethical producers of meat that may be a little more expensive but it would definitely be worth it. If you go right to vegetarianism you won't be contributing to the demand if meat, correct, but you also won't be increasing demand for ethical meat. This can also be said about milk and eggs. Always source locally if possible and organic when it comes to livestock is always the best option. If possible visit the farm and see if you can check it out to make sure it is ethical.  In saying this, I have been vegetarian for 3 years now and cannot stomach the thought of meat. But if you are comfortable with the taste and texture and vegetarianism becomes too daunting for you, give buying ethical, free range organic animal produce a go :)"

There has only been once when a server asked me if I preferred my food to be cooked in a different oil than other foods that contained animal products were cooked in. Of course I said 'yes, please'. But really, there is only so much that you can do and veganism is all about preventing as much suffering as you can. You're not a lower vegan if your food accidentally comes into contact with other foods. As long as you are not causing demand for harm to animals, it is vegan and okay in my book."

But sometimes when I'm out with my friends and were at a bar that has those things, and I really need something to eat that's not a side salad, I'll get fries fully knowing that it is disgusting. Alcohol is an excellent lubricant for not giving a shit. If I have to choose between not eating when I'm really hungry/ had too much to drink or eating fries, I'll probably eat it.  And, what others are saying is true, that at restaurants sometimes you just don't/can't know.

It's not an ethical issue though - if I can't taste it and the meat isn't an actual ingredient in my food, I don't care. I'm not super fussy about things that are cooked on the same grill as meat (the meaty juices drizzle/burn off mostly, so I can't taste it).

If your motivation pertains to the ethical treatment of animals, a more hard-line stance makes sense. Every time you eat, there's a clear line between what you consider to be right or wrong, and that makes the decision making aspect of it more binary. However, if one chooses vegetarianism for another reason, such as environmental impact or personal health, it's more about doing what you can to have a more positive outcome. For example, I want to minimize my carbon footprint, but I still need a car to function where I live, so I own a small, fuel-efficient vehicle. It still pollutes, but it pollutes much less than other alternatives. Making decisions in this context facilitates more wiggle room."

If your pet, or even a person, were eaten, people would be horrified. It would be seen as some kind of desecration of their body.

Maybe if the first few diners sent back the meat a lazy chef tossed on the entrée, he would try a little harder and it might save years worth of ""accidental"" meat toppings.   If I send it back, I will also get an entrée I enjoy.  And something that I will eat 100% of.

I think the label of 'precious' is patronizing.  How would you feel if someone made up a label like 'doesn't give a damn' to describe those who are willing to eat whatever they are served?   I can understand the rationale behind eating whatever one is served.  I don't know if the animals are helped by people making up demeaning names about those who make a decision different than the one they would make and attributing that decision to emotional reasons instead of a thoughtout decision."

I've been doing this for 14 years now so it's easy to avoid meat since most of my family knows not to offer it to me. I've only had one issue with a restaurant bringing me something with meat on it. I had asked specifically for no shrimp. So when the waitress brings shrimp on my salad it's not my fault that I turn it away. Also no I can't just pick it off, I don't want any meat products on my food. Meat in no longer something I consider edible."

I just stear clear of meat entirely, and i am the annoying guy that asks whats in food when i go out, so Its never been an issue.

Honestly, I try to avoid identifying based on my diet at all.  I'll say things like ""I don't eat meat"" because, as a rule, I don't eat meat but if my salad accidentally comes with some bacon crumbles, it's not the end of the world to me and I'll eat it.

Vegetarianism,2btt9e,Fish-x-5,12,Sun Jul 27 02:16:19 2014 UTC,"Honestly, you need to not try to compete with your mother or what she's cooking. Let her cook for herself  and your dad and just worry about cooking food your own family will enjoy. Cook pasta for your family if you want to cook pasta for your family. You will be much happier and enjoy yourself more if you just let go of the need for her approval—at least in this one area of your life. So the question you might want to ask instead is ""What are some kick-ass meals I can make for my family on our beach-house vacation?"" In that case, I would answer...  Throw some polenta on the grill and serve it up over a salad of wilted greens. Grill some portobellos. Throw together a vegetarian bibimbap. Have a leisurely breakfast with scrambled tofu and hash browns. Grill some peaches or some pineapple for dessert one night. Make a banana split out of a banana, some coconut yogurt, a handful of nuts or chocolate chips, and some warm jam poured over the top. Have falafel wraps for lunch. Cook up some flatbreads loaded with veggies.. Try some shish kebab with tofu and veggies over rice pilaf. Make Indian food one night and serve up a killer veggie curry and some dal. Have mock tuna sandwiches for lunch with chickpeas. Make gorgeous salads with lots of different colors and throw on beans, or nuts, or seeds, or fruit to make them special.  Figure out YOUR menu first. Then go back and think about what part of it your mom and dad might enjoy as either a main dish or a side dish that they can add meat to if they so choose. Or just let them do their own thing. You can all sit down and eat together even if you don't have the same foods on your plates. If you really, really feel the need to impress your mother and you just can't let go of that idea, spend a couple of extra minutes plating each meal. Make sure you're serving up a variety of colors at each meal, and that the food is arranged on the plate rather than just plopped on or served family style. Add some nice garnishes, etc. How your food looks makes a difference in how it is perceived.   But mostly, I think you'll enjoy your vacation much more if you cook food you and your family enjoy. It just sounds so stressful to worry about trying to fit into the way she does things or to try to compete. And it's your vacation too, after all!"
Vegetarianism,2btt9e,bickets,4,Sun Jul 27 05:31:03 2014 UTC,"I 100% agree with this. If your mom has her own stubborn and uncompromising way of doing things, let her and your dad eat whatever it is they want to eat while you take care of your own family's needs. Tell her that you will cook for your family and she can cook for herself and your dad and don't let her browbeat you into some other arrangement. Your description sounds like she is trying to bully you about your food choices and that's unacceptable.  You didn't ask, but between the unwillingness to even try new foods and her issues about her grown-ass daughter eating whatever she wants on her own vacation, your mom sounds like the one who needs the therapist, not you."

I think part of my desire to impress her with our food is because she is thinks it's suspect and I want to show her we're ok. I've had a lot of health problems this year.

When picking a new place to eat we rely pretty heavily on Yelp to help us find what we're looking for. We also take friends/coworker advice into account, too.  Problem #1 is not knowing what's in the food. I recently discovered that Taco Bell sour cream isn't vegetarian, nor are bagels at some popular sandwich chains. And you can't count on the employees to know if their food has animal-based additives. Problem # 2 is choice. There simply aren't enough vegetarian options out there, especially at the fast food chains I see most often when traveling. Problem # 3 is lack of understanding of what constitutes a balanced vegetarian meal. Hint:  It's not a bowl of lettuce with some chopped tomatoes and dressing. I am a huge advocate for truth in labeling. Any business that produces food, whether it's a prepackaged food manufacturer or a restaurant should be legally required to list all ingredients used to make their food and have it easily accessible. No one should be able to get away with listing ""natural flavor"" or ""spices"" instead of the actual materials used."

Otherwise, I play it by ear...and hope I don't go hungry. Lack of choice is the most frustrating. Having one vegetarian option (or none) is annoying. It is hard to go out with friends to non-veg friendly places. I am usually stuck with french fries or some other fried food, or a salad. I don't really like mushrooms and that is usually the ONLY other option at most places (ie portobello mushroom burger). But, honestly, the most infuriating one is ""vegetarian"" meals that aren't vegetarian. For example, soups with chicken broth, or a salad with croutons...with bacon in them, or something fried with bacon fat to ""enhance the flavor"".  More veg friendly menus! And clearly marked veg and non-veg menu items that actually adhere to some type of standard; including making a distinction between vegan and vegetarian.  An app or something that knows your current location and can suggest veg-friendly places to eat would be fantastic.

If a restaurant advertises an in house made veggie burger or other less common veggie entree, chances are in will pick that place over other with more common veggie options (I.e. pasta with veggies and Boca burgers are boring.) I don't usually face too many problems. There is one I keep running in to though. Not all restaurants list everything that is in a dish. For example, I recently ordered green beans as a side. The green beans came with ham. The description on the menu said nothing about ham. Luckily my grandmother decided she liked my green beans.  It is helpful when a restaurant labels vegetarian or vegan entrees as such, but it also helps to know what can easily be made to fit either diet too."

Vegetarianism,2b0rj3,Randev72,6,Fri Jul 18 04:36:15 2014 UTC,"Longtime vegi here.  I've been vegetarian for 12 1/2 years.  I stopped eating meat when I was in college at UNM in Abq, New Mexico in 2002 and there were plenty of options there.   I moved back to Oklahoma City around 2006 and options were extremely limited.  We had one health food chain, Akins, and eating at restaurants was difficult (aka: pasta or salad...both of which you had to ask to have without meat usually).  In the last six years the city has changed drastically.  We now have 3 Sprouts stores statewide, 1 Wholefoods along with locally owned natural food stores, and both chain and local restaurants usually offer a few options and there are even some vegi only cafes. It's improved here drastically and for the better!"

Vegetarianism,2b0rj3,kriba,4,Sat Jul 19 03:20:09 2014 UTC,"I have been a veg for 18 years.  I was 15 and ate predominately vegetable based dishes and frozen options while living at home.  During college there was always a vegetarian dish but it tended to be something like quesadilla or soup (which I loved) but not something well rounded and nutritionally balanced.  I subsided on cheese and salad bar and had a B-12 deficiency, which I received injections for.   Now 10 years on there is far more variety offered in ""regular"" grocery stores from fresh ""deli meats"" to frozen entrees.  Restaurants have certainly come a long way from my days of ordering the salad with out the chicken on top but I still find myself often disappointed.  It really doesn't take much to offer a veggie burger or some sort of vegetable only wrap but I don't always find that (I live in a major city).  This past weekend I was at a downtown causal restaurant for lunch and ordered their soba noodle salad but asked for it without the chicken. They were unable to do this because they pre mix EVERYTHING. I find this extremely unnecessary and disappointing.  Don't even get me started on the large national chains.  99 I'm looking at you!"
Vegetarianism,2b0rj3,catalot,3,Fri Jul 18 14:26:42 2014 UTC,"Over the past 17 years, I feel like it's become more socially accepted by non-veggetarians. I don't usually get the antagonistic or defensive questions from people my age who find out that I'm vegetarian. Nice restaurants that are traditionally based around meat will often offer a veggie option on their menu. There is even one place (I plan to try) where smoking meat is their main thing, but they also offer smoked tofu and veggies. I know in the US meat is often cheaper than veggies but in Canada vegetarian has always been the cheaper way to go, and vegan the cheapest of all. I went through a period of months where my budget was very limited so I cut out eggs and dairy to save money during that time."

Perhaps now would be a good time to revisit why you went veg in the first place. Was there a particular experience that cemented your decision to stop eating meat? Try watching a video like Earthlings or Meet Your Meat if you really need to refresh your memory.   Also try experimenting with new recipes and find some new veg food blogs to drool over, even if you're a good cook sometimes things can become a bit routine and it's good to get excited about your food again and go outside your comfort zone.   Besides that the only advice I can give is to wait it out and it will pass eventually, that's how it has always been for me whether it's for cigarettes or animal products."

Fake meat doesn't even come close appeasing my cravings. You are stronger than your cravings though. I agree that you should revisit why you gave it up on the first place. People occasionally slip up and eat something they shouldn't have, but you can get back on track. You don't have to have any of the meat you've been craving, you just kind of want it. Once you get back in the vegetarian groove, you'll be good to go.   So basically I don't have any advice. I really only came to offer words of encouragement. You got this!"

I, much like /u/missslushie gave up meat for ethical reasons - if no animal had to die for it I'd quite gladly eat a burger right now... I think it's normal to miss some food that you give up for whatever reason (whether it's for a diet in order to lose weight, for health reasons e.g. allergies/intolerances, or moral reasons).  But /u/skulloflugosi is right, it's probably psychological and you should try new things (random examples: try tofu/soy stuff you haven't had before, new veggies and fruits, other kinds of beans, make your own vegan cheese just to see what it's like,...)"

I almost never even ate fast food, but I NEEDED it, I guess just for the quick meat fix.

Vegetarianism,2apffm,atticuskraft,5,Mon Jul 14 21:54:46 2014 UTC,"Protein you can get from legumes such as lentils (dhal is amazing, I have it nearly once a week) and red beans (chili sin carne tastes better than con carne, it's amazing), but also milk and cheese. Pasta and various ravioli are also rich in protein. If you can get your hands on these, try making a salad with them and fresh tomatoes, green salad, and various seeds. That's a good summer comfort food.  Anyway, as long as you have a diverse diet, there is no reason to worry about nutrient deficiency. Only vegans have to take B12.  Also, let me give you the advice no one gave me when I became vegetarian : eat plenty rice in the beginning. Because you will have liquid shits for a few weeks."
Vegetarianism,2apffm,Taltyelemna,5,Mon Jul 14 22:41:57 2014 UTC,"This. It's really easy actually. If you're worried about B12, you can get supplemented soy milk containing Iron, Calcium and B12. I have done some research and the hype around estrogen in Soy is just that, hype. You would need to drink something like 3 or 4 litres a day to feel any effects. And soy hot chocolate is DELICIOUS!"
Vegetarianism,2apffm,Kimberlyrenee,7,Tue Jul 15 00:45:37 2014 UTC,"Only vegans have to take B12.   This isn't true. Even some meat eaters don't get enough (whether because they don't take in enough or because they have poor absorption -- the latter of which is very common in those over 50). Vegetarians may easily have low B12 intake, even if they are not strictly vegan. Fortunately, supplements are cheap and easy and safe, so there is no reason to up animal products in one's diet just for B12.   Also, vitamin D can be an issue even with a diverse diet. Some people can and do get enough sun exposure that it's not an issue. Others should supplement."
Vegetarianism,2apffm,M4124124,2,Tue Jul 15 01:25:47 2014 UTC,"So true! I had both B12 and vitamin D deficiencies detected after about two years of a veg diet despite still eating dairy (mostly yogurt and cheese but never cows milk and rarely eggs).  If you don't take vitamins, let your PMD know you are a vegetarian and to test you for relevant nutritional deficiencies."
Vegetarianism,2apffm,dundermifflin123,1 point,Tue Jul 15 02:21:41 2014 UTC,"The person before me said that only vegans have issues. I agree, but with B12 you hardly need much at all. A glass of fortified milk gives about 50% of your RDI so you should be fine. If you still drink milk and eat eggs I wouldn't worry about it."
Vegetarianism,2apffm,Kimberlyrenee,2,Tue Jul 15 02:05:35 2014 UTC,"You hardly need much at all daily, correct, but you also don't absorb all that you take in. Even assuming that you absorb 100% of the B12 in fortified milk, is everyone drinking two glasses of fortified milk every single day? I know I'm not. Not even close. But I do take a B12 supplement.   Do you know how much milk and eggs you have to eat daily to get enough daily?    One cup of whole milk gives you less than 1/5th of your daily needs: http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/dairy-and-egg-products/69/2  A large egg gives you less than 1/10th: http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/dairy-and-egg-products/117/2  And that, again, assumes you are absorbing it fully. It is already recommended that ALL people over 50 take a B12 supplement because of lowered absorption. And both people I've personally known with severe B12 deficiencies were over 50 but very heavy meat eaters.   So, take a supplement and get tested (to make sure that you are absorbing them and aren't in the minority of people who need shots). Then you don't have to worry."
Vegetarianism,2apffm,M4124124,3,Tue Jul 15 15:46:16 2014 UTC,"Guess which vested interest lobbies hard against soy for ""health reasons""?  Yup, you guessed it - the meat industry.  If you are really worried about things like cancer then you'd cut out the meat and increase your vegetables.  If you were really worried about disrupting your body's biological processes, you'd cut out the hormone-filled meat which is dripping with antibiotics.  Of course there are going to be people who are sensitive to soy, just like how some people are sensitive to gluten. That doesn't mean that rye is bad for you, and nor is soy - especially when it's in moderation. L"

Vegetarianism,2apffm,zzanna,4,Tue Jul 15 02:54:51 2014 UTC,"Regarding Omega 3 fatty acids, if you want to get as close as possible to what is found in fish you might want to look for Omega 3 from algae. It's what those omega-3 fatty fish eat, after all. This is one example. Apparently, there is little clinical proof of the effects of flax-derived Omega 3s. Most data we have about the benefits of these oils comes from fish-based studies.  Setting Omega 3s aside: I have been a vegetarian for more than ten years, and I do take some supplements. However, I'm not sure it has anything to do with my vegetarianism. I just have some symptoms that indicate, for example, low magnesium and potassium, so I supplement with those.  My point is, why not try eating a varied and whole-food based diet, and see how you feel after a few weeks? You could even try logging you food intake (like people do to lose weight) and using that to track your nutrition. Some apps will do that automatically, so you can see how much protein, calcium, iron, etc. you're getting.   Edit: I want to add that supplementing isn't always a good thing. For example, new research is suggesting calcium supplementation may cause atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries). And if you're male with no history of anemia, you probably don't want or need to supplement iron."
Vegetarianism,2apffm,Buffalo__Buffalo,3,Tue Jul 15 02:52:22 2014 UTC,"You can get all of the nutrients you need easily just by eating a balanced and varied plant based diet, I have been vegetarian for over 10 years now and haven't ever needed to take any kind of supplements. One thing you might like to look into getting is Chia seeds, they're full of protein, calcium and omega-3!   I'm always dubious of the vitamin pills you can buy just because they contain so much more the nutrients than you could ever use in a day, so a lot of it is just wasted. But if you do decide they are your best course of action be careful to check that any capsules don't contain gelatin.  Well done for going vegetarian and good luck!"

Asking what that customer's favorite flavors and ingredients are is a much better way to judge if a dish will make them happy than whether or not you like it. If they ask what you specifically like, you can point them toward the veg-n dishes on the menu. When you're in customer service, you should always try to talk about yourself as little as possible - the spotlight should be on the customer, not you."

In example, if someone were to ask me about a chipotle BLT and really pressed me about the flavor profile, I would tell them that the kitchen uses the freshest lettuce and juiciest tomatoes, does a great job with frying up their thick cut bacon so that it's crunchy but not at all burned, and the mayo brings a smokey, spicy, creamy note throughout.

The best advice is certainly the first comment, draw the attention away from you and towards your customers. Whenever I'm asked right out what my favorite cut of meat is I tell the customers the truth of the matter and explain my dietary choices. Which obviously gets a mixed reaction, some people snigger, others ask me if I enjoy torturing myself, some people are plain rude, regardless of what they say smile and attempt to help them. While I cannot guide someone to my favorite cut of meat, I can tell you what type of meat is best for certain dishes, or can be prepared certain ways.   Research is the key. You want to continue to do a good job, otherwise you risk your job. No you do not have to eat everything to answer their questions, but inquire into their tastes, or simply suggest dishes based upon vegetarian alternatives. Eggplant parm is remarkable close to chicken parm, and you can judge the basic flavor profile off of that.   Just be yourself and don't allow them to perceive your life choices as a burden to their experience. You can help them despite the fact, and as has been already pointed out, you can guide them towards the vegetarian options or suggest a modified vegan meal as per your own tastes. You'd be surprised how many people I've convinced to put down the steaks and try a vegetarian alternative while at work."

When asked what the best dish is often say something like ""I'm personally vegetarian but this one is the most popular"". People either get bummed out or are happy for the suggestion and often ask what my favourite is or what the best vegetarian one is.

Vegetarianism,2a2x8x,bartendingbandit,2,Tue Jul 8 17:39:40 2014 UTC,"Similar situation, worked in an italian/pizza joint for two years while being a vegetarian/veganish. There are things on the menu that I did enjoy being a vegetarian. Personally, I ask my co-workers what are good things on the menu (for example, I had no clue our chicken was spicy, an important thing to note for older people and those with dietary issues). So if they ask how's the chicken, I say enthusiastically that some people love it, especially if they like spicy food. I tend to frame meat in the positive without personally saying that I enjoy it. Secondly, I have a very different answer when someone asks ""do you like it?"" I answer with, I personally never have had it since I don't eat meat, but it's one of our most popular dishes and it smells ammmaaaaazing."" You know, sell it. Act confidently about your food especially if you haven't personally consumed it. Third, when people ask what my favorite things on the menu are, I always am truthful and say veggie options first, because those are the things I do enjoy. Working in an italian joint, you can say eggplant parm, pizzas, calzones, etc, which is nice. Or chicken marsala with extra vegetables instead of chicken, your choice. But then, if you get the vibe that the customer is looking for a meat based dish, then I move into what the best seller is, or most popular, or what your co-workers love. Personally, I don't like to get into the conversation about my diet because then they don't take anything you say seriously about meat-based dishes. Another trick I like to say, which could drive your co-workers insane, is to call a server over that you know loves the dish and ask them how it is in front of them. Usually they'll back you up, or have a better idea of their favorite menu item. That one usually works great. The ol' one-two."

For example :  Meat eaters may also be B12 deficient, especially if on antacids,  age 50+, low on intrinsic factor, had gastric surgery, or simply don't eat enough in the diet.  Vegetarians can get some B12 from the animal products they do eat. Perhaps author is thinking of vegan ?

Vegetarianism,29shlr,M4124124,2,Mon Jul 14 01:08:08 2014 UTC,"I don't think there are going to be any rigid plans like what you seem to be looking for - vegetarianism isn't as restrictive as keto or paleo or other diets! In fact, I think my best advice for you would be to simply vary it up as much as possible. Vary your grains (rice, quinoa, millet, wheat pasta or bread, corn tortillas), vary your proteins (eggs, beans, lentils, fake meats like tofu, seitan, ) vary your vegetables (any and all green, orange, red, purple, rainbow colored bite of deliciousness from the ground!). Don't forget nuts and fruit for snacks, toppings, and healthy dessert ingredients! It helps to stop thinking of ""replacing"" or ""missing"" meat, and start with meals that are already commonly vegetarian: lentil soup, mac and cheese with broccoli, fried rice, tabouli salad for hot summer days, quiches if you are feeling french, bean-based chili, lots of mediterranean and ethnic dishes that are vegetarian already if you just look at the menu of any authentic restaurant (curries, veggie sushi, hummus, spanikopita, etc.). And don't forget to just keep piling on the easy veggie side dishes! Cookbooks can be a great inspiration, and the best ones also serve as guides for questions like ""what is a lima bean?"" and ""how do I cut an onion?"" --- the two best any vegetarian could recommend to a beginner (imho) are Mark Bittman's How to Cook Everything Vegetarian and Molly Katzen's The Enchanted Broccoli Forrest (or any of the Moosewood cookbooks; Katzen is one of the co-founders of the Moosewood restaurant). I'd try to look through them in a bookstore to see if the writing style resonates with you -- a book you don't use because you can't understand is worthless! If those don't float your boat, then I'd look to Deborah Madison and her Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone. There are some great food blogs out there, but none that will cover the basics of nutrition, cooking style, and other starter questions the way that a great cookbook would! Have fun, and keep us posted! I'm a vegetarian for 8 years now, and I think about it almost never -- it just comes naturally, there's never a time I can't find a salad (or cheese fries!) on a menu that I would love to eat, etc. Mostly it comes up when I have people over for dinner and they say ""wow, I can't believe that was so good without any meat"" and I hadn't even been thinking that I was in any way depriving them! I wish you the same good luck!"

Vegetarianism,288gx8,LocutusOfBorges,15,Sun Jun 15 23:01:31 2014 UTC,"Neither the ethical, nor the environmental aspect of consuming animal products are solved by todays artificial meat. Artificial meat is at the moment and for the foreseeable future, an experiment in very large-scale cell culturing. That's why the same methods are used, using animal stem cells to grow the meat and using fetal bovine serum to feed it. So current artificial meat needs the meat industry to work. Vegetarian alternatives for the serum are not in sight. Even then, processing the plants to produce the serum and growing the meat in clean rooms to not contaminate it, produce an overhead that might not be as bad as eating animals directly, but is still going to make an impact over eating plants directly.  Furthermore, people will still want to consume diary and eggs, keeping up the animal industry. I would rather hope that, given enough time, fake meats like beyond meat can be made with better textures (maybe with 3d printing) to better emulate the meat experience. It certainly will be better for the environment and is, contrary to artificial meat, actually feasible."

It wouldn't even take that long to balance out. Pregnant female deer are capable of reabsorbing their fetuses during periods of hardship, and we would see the birthrate drop drastically as soon as the herd sizes started becoming unsustainable.  I want to add that I do not think that families that rely on deer hunting to put food on the table should stop hunting.

If not is the problem more important than this time with your family is worth?   Would you be comfortable mostly just chilling with them/helping carry stuff while they fish and not actually do any fishing yourself?   *At least the fish won't be wasted, and fishing is less cruel than mass farming.   If you don't think you would have a good time because of the animal suffering then you won't enjoy it and probably shouldn't go, if you think the enjoyment of spending time with your family would outweigh the negative feelings and leave you with happy memories then perhaps you should go.   Its something you have to decide for yourself. If it were me I'd probably go but try and do as little fishing as I could."
Vegetarianism,2825qn,KnMn,1 point,Fri Jun 13 16:38:43 2014 UTC,"I feel like as long as factory farming and over-fishing are still a thing, I shouldn't participate in the consumption of meat. So I guess that's a yes, I do include small-scale fishing like this.  I've definitely decided to go along; I don't have a problem with hanging out. Maybe if I get bored I'll throw a line in -- in ten years of fly fishing I've never caught a thing, so I don't expect to catch anything this time either if I don't take it seriously.   Thanks!"

Initially we though that there was no way that the meals we were receiving were going to be enough for us, but every time it's so surprising how filling and delicious the meals are.   I don't really know if each meal is worth the $20, honestly. But I guess you're paying for the ease and convenience and sometimes you get some really fancy foods.   Be weary though because the only reason why we got the Hello Fresh box is because it was supposed to be free. Then we kept getting boxes, not realizing we were being charged. So I guess that's a downfall. It's partially our fault though because we didn't check to see if the credit card was being charged.

The first time it happened I puked for hours and almost went to the hospital. One time my period started at school, and as I was walking home from the bus stop I collapsed on the side of the road in the fetal position because the cramps were so painful. When they hit, the only thing I could do was take Midol, curl up into a ball and fall asleep until it was over. I even got a prescription for pain medication from the doctor, but it didn't work any better than Advil.  After I stopped eating meat, I never had the cramps again. I've had moderate ones once or twice when I was under a lot of stress, but over a period of more than two years, and they didn't prevent me from leaving the house to do things. Based on my own experience, I wouldn't be surprised at all if it's the meat that's messing up your periods."

Vegetarianism,27acbq,KyleDComic,11,Wed Jun 4 12:47:31 2014 UTC,"I feel like it is totally normal. I wouldn't focus on the fact that it is meat you're craving, b/c really you're probably craving Popeyes. You saw Popeyes on TV and were like ""That shits delicious, I crave that."" Every so often when I get the ""You know what tasted awesome? (insert fast food/non fast food meat containing item here.)"" I'll go make it myself with meat substitutes and BOOM, no more craving it.   My favorites are:    McDonalds burgers with fake meat and home fixings (tastes even better, I think!)  Chick'n and Waffles (Gardein crispy chicken and frozen waffles. Gawddamn, so good.)  Corn dogs: endless varieties of veg options. My fav right now are the Trader Joe's vegan ones.    There is a possibility that you're lacking protein. Idk what your diet is like, how closely you pay attention to your caloric and protein needs, etc, but honestly I feel like I get so much protein it's coming out of my ears (or rear, I guess?)   So, my suggestion is when you crave something super unhealthy and specific (like fast food) you fix yourself up something similar in a meat-free variety. 3 months is fucking awesome, but when you compare it to the length of your life you spent actually eating meat, it isn't much time for your brain to readjust and stop craving things, and it is easy for us to say ""Hey, that tasted good, obviously I crave meat"" when really you're just craving the taste of the particular item (which usually has nothing to do with meat at all, it's all in the seasonings/fixins.)   I hope this was helpful! And good job on 3 months!"

Vegetarianism,27acbq,10000Buddhas,1 point,Wed Jun 4 18:10:04 2014 UTC,1000 calories seems awfully low.  You're just hungry and the TV ad got your attention.  What is your bmr?

Vegetarianism,27acbq,lillalilly,1 point,Wed Jun 4 19:07:43 2014 UTC,"I really second the nuts suggestion. A handful of almonds is easily 500-700 calories.  At the local supermarket I buy in bulk unsalted unflavored almonds, pecans, and walnuts and eat them every meal. You can even eat them as a snack.  You may want to also up your proteins by adding in seeds. I suggest buying bulk shelled hemp seed and chia seed online. You can put a couple spoonfuls on any dish you eat and it doesn't really change the texture or flavor, all while adding anywhere from 10-20 G protein (depend on if you put it on all your dishes in the day) and great fats.  Not to mention all the minerals in nuts and seeds too.  These two tips are easy healthy ways to pack in nutrient dense calories."

Vegetarianism,27acbq,non4545,4,Wed Jun 4 17:35:43 2014 UTC,"Completely normal. The first year I was vegetarian, I had very regular meat cravings. You've been eating and enjoying meat your whole life, so of course you'll crave it. After a year for me, it became completely natural, and I didn't think about it anymore. Sometimes you can crave meat because your body is lacking protein or iron, though. I've been a vegetarian for 10 years now, and a few months ago I had an overwhelming craving for steak. I just couldn't shake it. I knew I hadn't been eating well lately and I was feeling rather tired, so I figured I needed iron. Ate a spinach, broccoli, kidney bean salad. Felt much better.  TLDR: Sometimes your cravings are telling you something, but sometimes you just want Popeyes because you like Popeyes. You're doing a great job! Keep it up, friend."

Each of those elements could be switched out: Protein: your choice of beans--navy, pinto, black, garbanzo, lentils... Greens: collards, mustard, spinach, kale, chard...darker the better Seasoning: chipotle, mole, curry, bbq...you can emulate lots of dishes by changing the spices Grain: brown/black/wild/red rice/quinoa, rice noodles, bulgar, millet...

Vegetarianism,277ln6,bryngwirion,3,Wed Jun 4 15:49:18 2014 UTC,"I like doing a big pot of curry. It's kind of long but is pretty simple, just adding ingredients to a pot and waiting.  Finely dice a yellow onion and start frying it in some olive oil in the pot, the longer the better. Finely dice some garlic and fresh ginger and toss it in as well.  This next part is key: fry your spices with the above for 5-10 minutes to build up the flavors. Use cumin, turmeric, chili powder, and coriander seed, or just mix two different curry powder blends. Mix them with some water before adding them so they don't burn. You can't really overcook these, just go until they smell really really good.  Then you can add your main ingredient. This could be firm tofu, sweet potatoes, cauliflower, or whatever you feel like that takes the longest to cook. Fry it up so it gets the flavors all in it.  From there it's simple; add your liquid - I like using a couple cans of coconut milk, but veggie broth or water works too - then the rest of your ingredients, whatever you like. I tend to use chickpeas, tomatoes, spinach, green bell peppers and chili peppers, and broccoli with sweet potatoes from earlier.   Cook all that until everything's nice and mixed, then you can add a bit of garam masala powder near the end - or a bit of cinnamon, cloves, and black pepper if you can't find that - and some more fresh garlic. Those are both optional depending on the flavors you like, but I usually do both of them.  Make some basmati rice to go with it and top with fresh chopped cilantro, this makes a whole lot depending how much stuff you put in."

Anything else in your fridge you feel like adding, like ketchup, BBQ sauce, sriracha sauce. Go nuts.   Dice everything that can be diced, drain the bean juice from one can of beans but add the other. Put everything in the cooker, stir. Low heat for 12 hours. Eat with bread, rice, fries or fried tortilla chips. Freezes very well.   I will fix the format shortly."

Simple, satisfying, nutritious, and delicious! As a basic  bastardization formulation just sautée whatever vegetables you've got (fresh and in-season preferably) and serve with a bean chili over grains. Balance your spices accordingly. If you're going to store it keep the components in separate containers and combine when reheating.  Another failsafe standby is meatless shepherd's pie. Replace ground beef with mashed lentils and/or TVP or faux meat crumbles and season to taste."

I can recognize better ways of living, without having to take all of them to their ultimate conclusion immediately.    I recognize the threat of climate change but drive a car.  Ethically, I should take my car to the scrap dealer today.   I give money to a local charity and recognize that I could give more.  How do I morally justify not giving as much as I can?

I'd argue that the suffering associated with producing dairy & eggs is greater if not the same than producing the meat which you're abstaining from. Two simple examples, you can search more or ask if you're inclined: male chicks immediately get discarded & ground up during sorting out future laying hens, cows that no longer produce dairy get sent off for slaughter for food/feed well before their natural lifespan.   The pet thing still confuses me though, it seems cruel and massively counter-intuitive to make a hungry dog vegetarian,   Dogs are omnivores and can thrive on veg*n food.

That is, there will never be an ethical way of removing meat from an animal (ignoring for the moment the lab-grown meat trend - whch I am very much in favor of), so to me, eating meat is immoral in principle.  I can, however, imagine a world where eggs and milk are harvested in way that does not cause undue suffering or even inconvenience to animals.  We may be very far from that ideal today, but it is possible to one day eliminate animal suffering while still producing eggs and milk.  That's why I think eating eggs and dairy is only immoral in practice.  Once farming standards are improved, and we can be reasonably sure that harvesting dairy/eggs does not result in undue suffering, then in my mind, it is no longer immoral to eat eggs/dairy.  To that end, I do what I can today to buy morally: I pay 2X the price of normal eggs in order to get cage free eggs. b) i personally do not handle meat for others.  My policy is if you want meat, you go and get it/prepare it. c) I don't think any person should feel obligated to personally contribute to charity.  The best part of being human is that by being a member of a capitalist economy, we are everyday engaged in positive sum transactions that generate lots of value.  This value is shared by every member of the economy, and the more people that join it, the more everyone benefits.  As an example, the single biggest act that had the largest worldwide impact of poverty were the economic reforms that China did in the 1970s.  This allowed China to engage in small to mid scale capitalism.  This allowed China to compete on the world market, and soon practically everything was manufactured in China.  The end result of this was millions and millions of people were pulled out of poverty.  They were working for wages that allowed them to afford consumer goods for the first time, and their quality of life improved dramatically.  All this happened without a single penny of charitable aid.  Instead it was just by accessing the global market."
Vegetarianism,25xs4k,cultic_raider,3,Mon May 19 18:16:50 2014 UTC,"I love where you've went with this, the eggs issue and the capitalism issue are very interesting.   It's definitely possible that eating eggs could in principle be acceptable, provided the chicken didn't suffer (again under utilitarianism) . It also seems to be the case that the current state of affairs doesn't generally allow for ethical egg consumption. But this begs the question, could someone then just eat lab-grown meat that have never been functioning parts of sentient beings? I feel I am bound to saying yes, barring other consequences to this practice which might not be obviously foreseeable.   I don't pretend to be as savvy on the capitalism as yourself, but I find myself agreeing that market growth is potentially better than charity work for producing greater pleasure (again utilitarian def.) but I don't see that they need to be mutually exclusive. As well, it could be argued that capitalism is a fundamentally exploitative process and generates more pain than in fact it does pleasure so I'm not so sure on that. I would admit though that I am proposing that tentatively, I don't have the stats or deep enough political insight to support that at this point."
Vegetarianism,25xs4k,purple_potatoes,1 point,Mon May 19 13:22:57 2014 UTC,"Thanks, much appreciated!  I think the specifics of lab grown meat are still very uncertain, and its the details that are going to determine whether or not it is truly moral or immoral.  If it is the case that lab grown meat is grown from a culture of cells that are extracted virtually harmlessly from an animal (maybe via injection or something like that) and then grown independently, then I'm all for it.  If there is something else going on then it all depends.    As for charity, I'm all for it,  I think its very honorable when people donate to charity, and I think we should admire those that do it.  I try to give what I can when I can.  But I definitely don't worry about donating every penny of excess wealth that I have, or volunteering every weekday after work or weekends.  I don't feel guilty for spending money that I earn on stuff that I want that isn't an absolute necessity, like electronics or clothing.  This is because every thing I spend money on supports a business somewhere.  And that business supports workers, who use the money they make to buy stuff that supports other business and workers.  There's a statistic that I really like here:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty_in_india  That says in 1947 the average income in South Korea was USD 770.  By 1999, it had risen to USD 13,317.  That's just tremendous! Imagine how many more people were able to afford food, clothing, medical supplies, education, etc, due to economic development in South Korea.  And none of that came from charity, it came from people working, developing skills, making themselves valuable, and participating in the global marketplace.  It came from Americans, Europeans, etc, buying up products and services from companies like Samsung, LG, Hyundai, Kia, and many more.  Compared to the tremendous value-generating power of a robust economic engine, I often feel that charity, as noble as it is, is often just a drop in the bucket.    Exceptions are people like Bill Gates.  Bill is probably the greatest humanitarian of our time, and is doing absolutely amazing things in Africa.  In my eye he's one of the most inspiring individuals in the world.  But he started by making billions in the most robust economy in the history of the world, and actually had a reputation for being a greedy, and a thief.  If the greatest charitable contribution is your end goal, then generating billions via the US economy is the best way to go.  Now I won't deny at all that there is a dark side to capitalism.  Capitalism is motivated by the generation of value for humans, sometimes at the expense of wildlife.  Capitalism also favors those who have a lot of capital (i.e. rich people) so it favors them at the expense of the poor.  Capitalism isn't perfect by any means, unintended consequences abound everywhere you care to look, but I still think it's the best game in town.  It's the only system that I know of that can utilize the greed and selfishness that is inherent to humans and use it to create value for an entire society.  There's a great quote from Adam Smith:  ""“It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own self-interest. We address ourselves not to their humanity but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities, but of their advantages”   If we fast forward a few hundred years, I think we'll be able to move past capitalism onto a post-scarcity economy (we already have the beginnings of a post scarcity economy, most of the biggest services that we use, like google, facebook, twitter, etc, are all free).    But to get there, we'll need a hell of a lot of innovation, and above all else, capitalism is like a machine for innovation.  That's another one of its biggest strengths.  The amount of innovation happening in the epicenters of the capitalist world, like NYC, Silicon Valley, London, Tel Aviv, Etc, is unmatched in any other period of mankind.  I think this innovation will ultimately help us solve all our problems.  Many of the environmentally conscious technologies that we have today might not be available without the green revolution.  Toyota doesn't product the Prius out of moral obligation, but out of self interest, and that's ok.  If you want to see whether Capitalism over all creates more pain or pleasure, then I would recommend reading about the ""Malthusian Trap"":  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malthusian_trap  It was thought at one time that the production of food could never outpace the expansion of population, and so people will always be on the verge of starvation.  It was mostly true until the Industrial Revolution, when everything changed forever."

Vegetarianism,25xs4k,yayaja67,3,Mon May 19 19:51:21 2014 UTC,"Thanks!   You bring up a very good question, and I don't know if I have a good answer for it.  By spending money on compassionately produced eggs, I'm hurting the profits of egg producers that do not produce eggs with compassion, while simultaneously rewarding companies that do produce compassionately.  Eventually (if enough people follow suit), egg producers, acting with 100% self interest, would be forced to produce eggs ethically.  By abstaining eating eggs all together, I still hurt the unethical producers, but I don't help the ethical producers.    I am currently under the impression that if I buy cage-free eggs, i'm buying eggs from farms that treat their chickens well.  I might be wrong about that, and really I can never know for sure what kind of treatment those chicken are getting.   Now it doesn't make a difference to the egg industry one lick whether they get my $5 a month or not, but I think in general, supporting smaller business that try to grow food ethically can make a big difference if enough people do it.  If enough people buy food ethically then it makes economic sense for large producers to start investing millions of dollars of their own money to open factories to make more food ethically at a larger scale.  Eventually the economies of scale kick in, and ethically produced food can be come nearly as cheap as non-ethical food.  That's when public policy can take over.  If the public sees a dozen unethical eggs for $2 and a dozen ethically produced eggs for $2.25, they are going to wonder why we let farmers hurt chickens just to save them 25 cents on a dozen eggs.  Once you get to that point, you're only a few lobbyists and a 60 minutes special away from banning of the unethical production of eggs.  So that's my thought process, I don't know if it will be a convincing argument for you, because i'm not really sure if it's 100% correct myself."

If you're still insistent on consuming animal products (and are okay with the death it entails) I'd encourage you to look for Animal Welfare Approved labels or Certified Humane.

I also have a cat and a snake. Cat is pre-gan, but I'd get another cat after. No excuse for that or the snake. They didn't/can't choose veganism, but I could choose to not have carnivores as pets.

I used to love meat and cheese before switching to a vegan diet 1.5yrs ago. I thought vegans were just misguided vegetarians. I was ignorant. I think that when something becomes important to you, you begin to think of it critically everywhere. You become passionate. I think, as a new vegetarian, you're probably still in the ""honeymoon phase"" of vegetarianism - still actively learning, and extremely passionate of your newfound knowledge. The world has changed for you, and you want to share that with others.  The problem is that everyone is passionate about something, and many of those things are huge issues. I acknowledge that I don't pay nearly as much attention to other important areas. For now I have chosen a select few on which to become educated, but that leaves me ignorant about several other issues. Partly this is due to sheer ignorance of the existence of certain issues, and partly this is due to laziness and selfishness.

Vegetarianism,25xs4k,PythagorasForest,0,Mon May 19 15:25:11 2014 UTC,"Saying ""People have different morals"" is not an argument for doing things that hurt other living things. Pointing out the prevalence of man-made suffering is not any sort of argument against a utilitarian system of ethics.   Slavery wasn't ethically sound in the past, it is simply the case that people chose to commit unethical acts on the basis of beliefs which are rooted in bigotry and lack of knowledge. One of the things that sets humans apart from other animals is our ability to reason and make decisions based on it, and one of the things that sets humans in 2014 apart from humans in 1820 is the advancement in our collective understanding of biology and our more advanced and informed systems of ethics.  If a person is basing their unethical behavior on arguments used from centuries past then it would be good to know what those actual arguments were. With slavery, the ideas that race A) Is a biological rather than a social construct and B) Informs any kind of hierarchy, both fall apart against contemporary knowledge. Likewise, advancements in scientific knowledge now disprove the all-to-convenient belief of the past that animals cannot feel pain (as was the mindset for thousands of years of human-centric and dualist beliefs), and that animals were put on earth for people to consume. As such, there is not an ethical defense of the consumption of animals, there are only poorly formulated excuses that are rooted in the exact same kinds of ignorant beliefs on which slavery was justified. With the advancement of human knowledge comes an advancement of our ethics, and just as people look back on slavery and wonder how people could have justified it for so long, people will look back on meat consumption and wonder how, in AD 2014, humans could ignore the ethical considerations inherent to their dietary decisions.  Again, though, the fact that some people hurt others and some people help others does not mean that both are right, and is in itself not a defense of any system of ethics or lack there of - it's an observation."
Vegetarianism,25qzbc,kathygriffinrules,3,Fri May 16 22:30:58 2014 UTC,"I'm sorry but this article isn't very well written and I disagree with the premise. I would not appreciate someone discounting my charitable deeds just because my moral starting point doesn't directly correlate with theirs. If there are organizations giving food to the homeless and the meat industry is happy to donate, then I'm glad the homeless are getting food. Not everyone agrees with being vego and I personally respect that choice, just as I expect them to respect mine. I might suggest they look into buying ""ethically farmed"" or add more vego meals to their diet, but that's as far as I think I can reasonable press my ethics onto another human being.  Being vego works for me and has done for more that 10 years, but I do not think that by extension it works for everyone on the planet. If I were homeless, I think that edible, nutritious food would be the priority- not a restricted diet that made a basic need more difficult to fulfill.   From a realist position, sometimes you have to hold off on one aim in order to achieve another, more immediate good. Feeding starving people is pretty darn important and if an effective method presented itself that included meat, and the people you are trying to feed already eat meat, then I believe the benefactor should work within the recipients' ethical system instead of imposing another one onto a vulnerable group."

Elevate your plate tower to the point you have no tofu left, with my friend it was a ""5 plates height tower"", then you take an heavy object and put on the top of the last plate, and you wait about 10 minuts.

Google will net you a lot of results, and an interesting absence of Snopes and Museum of Hoax articles saying ""nope, it's just a vicious rumor."" While the claims that they euthanize 95% of the animals they take in is probably exaggerated, there is clearly something to the claims that they are doing this."

I don't see PETA arguing that they only kill sick animals - they characterize it as euthanasia for animals where there is no hope for them to find a good home. They say,   there is a huge crisis of homeless animals with nowhere to go, and until people adopt instead of buy, and spay or neuter instead of breed, euthanasia is unavoidable.   I think this discussion is a little pointless without talking about actual numbers, but on the face of it, the claim that euthanasia is a necessary evil because the homeless animal population is so large is not necessarily unreasonable.  I don't think this is a cause to hate PETA, but a reason to question their argument. It's definitely not a case of PETA being a bloodthirsty animal-murdering organization. While their methods are divisive, I don't question their genuine interest in animal welfare."

Vegetarianism,25b64t,Vacuumtruckdriver,0,Mon May 12 03:21:42 2014 UTC,"First off congrats on becoming a vegetarian! Sounds like you made the best choice for you and your body, kudos :)  And yeah I hear what you're saying. Because you're not getting any calories from meat/meat products, it's natural to substitute those with calories from carbohydrates and fat.   If you eat low-fat dairy products and/or eggs, foods like Greek yogurt parfaits and omelets are excellent ways to get protein.  I would also make sure you're getting enough fiber with fruits and especially vegetables. It's really easy to be a ""vegetarian"" that lives off of cheese pizza and Diet Coke. Like you said, a lot of vegetarians eat more carbs. But perhaps one of the reasons they can go overboard is a lack of fiber in their diets. Make sure you're choosing whole grains over refined when eating pasta or rice. Also try adding things like flax or chia seeds to smoothies, breakfast cereals, etc. Flax and chia are pretty good sources of fiber and can help you feel fuller.  Of course, I'm no expert. There are a ton of factors, but one of the top reasons people have problems with portion control is a lack of fiber. Gradually increase your fiber intake by 3-5 grams each week (increasing too fast will lead to some digestive discomfort) and see if you notice a change in your appetite and the size of your portions.   Sorry this was so long! I hope this helps and please let me know how it works out for you :)"

May or May not result in Veal slaughter, but generally they still kill and eat them after.. So milk just helps them pay the bills and make money until then.  Sorry I'm on mobile.

The less touristy the more likely they are to work with you.  Try to eat at places slightly off the beaten path.  They won't be trying to cater to what they believe most tourists want i.e. tons of meat.   Even if it's somewhat cliched, get Rick Steve's tour guide.

On a practical side, I find it fairly unbelievable that their model is sustainable, mostly the selling calves to pet people - how many people really want a pet cow?.

I'm not against trying it though, not at all! I was just curious about how vegans and vegetarians feel about both sides."
Vegetarianism,24q2nu,applegoodstomach,8,Sun May 4 22:34:06 2014 UTC,"I think it's really wise to start with vegetarianism. Learn what you like and what works for you. I've been a veg*n for many years and started out as a vegetarian. I thought vegans were crazy! Then I learned more about it and began to understand. I am mostly vegan at present but sometimes I just want a slice of pizza. Lately I've been learning about nutrition and what it is my body needs when I'm craving greasy pizza. My body needs fats! Instead I'll grab some yummy cashew spread with crackers (loaded with fats)!   Honestly, when I'm eating dairy it's because I'm being lazy and I have a lot of guilt. I strongly believe we can survive without eating animals or their secretions and that they were not put on Earth for us to exploit. I understand that my views are so much different than most of the world. I can't pass judgement on others because they don't value the same things that I do.  Does that make sense? These are my beliefs and I'm going to live according to them but you do you! Do I wish the whole world would go vegan? Of course! BUT I don't want to force people to live their lives how I see fit. That's not my call!"
Vegetarianism,24q2nu,DickieAnderson,2,Sun May 4 23:15:16 2014 UTC,"I think so too, going directly to veganism could be way too extreme. But I will certainly give it a go, and a key aspect could very well be finding different delicious vegetarian and vegan recipes. Thanks for the great response!"
Vegetarianism,24q2nu,purple_potatoes,1 point,Mon May 5 09:44:30 2014 UTC,"I say go vegan. You can always back-pedal to vegetarian later, but either way it is a big change. The hard part of any new diet/lifestyle is changing old habits and replacing them with new ones. So, you're going to have to learn some new recipes, right? Why not learn vegan ones? It takes just about as much effort to search for vegan ones as it does to search for vegetarian ones. And replace other products as they wear out or get used up."
Vegetarianism,24q2nu,GobletOfFirewhiskey,3,Tue May 6 04:04:38 2014 UTC,"I have been Vegetarian for 3 years, Vegan for 5 months of that. I met a guy a few days ago who asked me and my boyfriend if we were Vegetarian of Vegan. We said vegetarian as we are currently travelling and cannot be Vegan. His response was ""thank god. Fuck Vegans and their whiny bullshit"". You know what, fuck him. There is a reason people are vegetarian. There are a lot of ethical dilemmas that come into play. Do what you feel comfortable with. If you like dairy, eat dairy. If you have ethical reservations with dairy try some alternatives. Almond milk, soy milk, oat milk, even hazelnut milk. I guarantee you will like at least one of them.   Some speciality shops also sell ice cream non dairy which tastes pretty close. I don't like ice cream but I also don't like non dairy ice cream so perhaps you will since it tastes so similar."
Vegetarianism,24q2nu,M4124124,1 point,Mon May 5 02:00:00 2014 UTC,"Vegetarian here - for about 3 years or so. I love dairy but had to cut back long before going meat-free due to calcium kidney stones. I still have cheese and yogurt regularly but I enjoy vegan meals as well. I'm about to go through a huge dietary change that will take me back to eating birds and fish but no dairy. I'm not excited about the change because I think it will be harder for me to give up dairy than it ever was meat. I think those who go vegan are great, it just isn't for me. Do what works for you."
Vegetarianism,24q2nu,funchy,10,Sun May 4 22:52:42 2014 UTC,"I'm a vegetarian for ethical/environmental reasons.  Veganism is absolutely the logical consequence of ethical/environmental vegetarianism.  I think vegetarianism should be regarded as a transitional thing whenever possible but, pragmatically, vegetarianism is still far preferable to an omni diet and so shouldn't be treated too harshly."
Vegetarianism,24q2nu,SuperSmashedBrother,4,Mon May 5 04:34:17 2014 UTC,"Since you're a vegetarian for ethical/environmental reasons, may I ask you then: why aren't you a vegan for the same ethical/environmental reasons? What's the difference to you? (not casting judgement, just honestly curious)"
Vegetarianism,24q2nu,janewashington,2,Mon May 5 09:53:56 2014 UTC,Sounds like they realize that vegetarianism is a stepping stone if you're in it for ethical/environmental reasons. Everyone's at a different part of their journey.  From Dickie:   Veganism is absolutely the logical consequence of ethical/environmental vegetarianism. I think vegetarianism should be regarded as a transitional thing
Vegetarianism,24q2nu,purple_potatoes,11,Mon May 5 18:12:34 2014 UTC,"Do as much as you're comfortable with. If you feel that you should give up meat, do that. Once you're comfortable with vegetarianism, then you can contemplate veganism. Switching to a healthy vegan diet is a big commitment, and you shouldn't jump right into it if you're not ready. If your friend bugs you, tell her you're taking things one step at a time.  You seem very preoccupied with what other people think of your choice. Remember that your dietary decisions are your business, and you don't have to justify yourself to others. Eat what feels right for you."
Vegetarianism,24q2nu,omtiho,2,Sun May 4 23:13:24 2014 UTC,"No no, you're misunderstanding, I don't care what other people think of my choice, I mean, I've been eating meat my entire life and not caring what people think about that. It's just that my friend bugging me made me think of this question and it was interesting to me what vegans and vegetarians think of each other! Other than that: you're absolutely right. Switching to a vegan diet directly could be a bit too extreme, so I'm just going to take it step by step."
Vegetarianism,24q2nu,yourlycantbsrs,1 point,Mon May 5 09:48:05 2014 UTC,"I keep seeing people use the word ""extreme"" to describe a vegan diet. I guess I felt that once upon a time, but even when I first tried going vegan I didn't really think of it as something ""extreme"". I've been on medical diet that was very, very restrictive. It sucked. I was glad at the end that it didn't help me. Vegan? Vegan is easy. I have plenty of tasty food to eat. There are so many vegan recipes and foods I've yet to even try, so it's hard to feel deprived. Many of my favorite meals/foods I've had I found after going vegan. The first month was maybe a bit hard because my husband and I had to learn to actually cook (we were horrible about cooking before and there weren't nearly as many restaurant options then as there are now). But except for that it really wasn't as bad as we thought. We started almost like an experiment and it was so easy that we stuck with it longer and longer. Then we watched Earthlings (http://www.earthlings.com) and realized there was no going back. That was about four years ago. And since then I've never been tempted to give it all up and go back to being non-vegan.   If you want any tips or other help, check out /r/vegan"
Vegetarianism,24q2nu,omtiho,9,Tue May 6 04:10:43 2014 UTC,"You have to do what you feel is right and best for your health.  I make efforts to avoid dairy and eggs. Maybe I'm not as good a person as I'd like to be,  but I can't seem to give it up completely.  My weak point is cheese.  I've tried every dairy free cheese I've seen and for me at least they're barely palatable.   Would i die without cheese... of course not.    But I admit I'm already under a lot of social pressure to give up vegetarianism and I don't have any local friends who are veg'n.   The area I live in is not progressive and it's the kind of place where hunting and dairy farming are popular.   It's just too much social isolation to go vegan,  almost never be able to eat out,  never be able to attend friend/family gatherings with food present, etc.      I am sure vegans often see me as hypocritical.   I admire them living by their principles.   My outlook is that every little bit counts.  Even if we could get omnis to do Meatless Mondays, imagine the lives saved and suffering that could be prevented.   If we could just get other Americans to eat sensible portions of meat per day, and not measure their meat consumption in pounds per day -- I believe it would make a difference.  I recognize that my country isn't ready to give up meat right now.  But if we.could just get society to willingly take baby steps,  one day we'd get there!"
Vegetarianism,24q2nu,yourlycantbsrs,1 point,Mon May 5 00:41:55 2014 UTC,"Absolutely, that's also how I see myself becoming, I'm going to have a big problem staying away from cheeses. But as I've said to others in the thread - taking it step by step, in a comfortable pace, is probably the best thing. Rushing it isn't going to do me any favors. And I think you're absolutely right: every little bit counts and every little bit of trying is making this slightly better than it was before. Thanks for your response!"
Vegetarianism,24q2nu,omtiho,9,Mon May 5 09:50:55 2014 UTC,I think lacto-ovo vegetarians should be applauded for taking a step in the right direction. However to me it seems like some seem to ignore the fact that dairy and milk production also harm animals. I think lacto-ovo vegetarianism is a great step to cutting out animal products completely as the jump from omni to vegan is a big one!
Vegetarianism,24q2nu,M4124124,3,Mon May 5 01:41:36 2014 UTC,"Yes, exactly, the switch from omni to vegan seems pretty extreme. But that's what's interesting to me: lacto-ovo vegetarianism is great and all, but it's still really harmful to animals, and I was just interested in seeing how vegans argue about that. Thanks for your response!"
Vegetarianism,24q2nu,honeyandvinegar,8,Mon May 5 09:52:40 2014 UTC,"I appreciate anyone reducing their consumption of animal products,  but I personally don't understand how someone who ethically objects to meat can continue to participate in the egg and dairy industries."
Vegetarianism,24q2nu,ArtifexR,2,Mon May 5 11:09:20 2014 UTC,"This is my thought exactly. In addition, though, I do realize that many people start out vegetarian and end up vegan. It can take years, but it happens. As long as they're aware of the atrocities in the dairy/egg industries, I think they'll get there eventually. We're all on a different part of our journey, though, so I see no reason to berate vegetarians for their choices as long as they're aware of all the consequences (not that you were berating, just in general!)."
Vegetarianism,24q2nu,indorock,5,Mon May 5 18:15:19 2014 UTC,"For reference, I'm a vegetarian who eats eggs and diary, though I try to buy soya milk when my budget allows it.  I've had vegans tell me that I'm basically ""as bad as an omnivore"" for eating diary products. I've had other vegans who think it's great to make any kind of reduction in consumption. Personally, I relate to meat-eaters in this way - if you're making any steps towards reducing your meat consumption, whether it's having one meal a week without meat or becoming pescetarian. As for vegans, I understand the choices, and I would if I could. But the fact is, where I live there aren't enough options for me to feel like I could do it healthily. My health will always come first.  Basically, I think any kind of ""preachy attitude"" is pretty detrimental to the cause, not to mention your relationships!"
Vegetarianism,24q2nu,slamhead,2,Mon May 5 11:17:22 2014 UTC,"But the fact is, where I live there aren't enough options for me to feel like I could do it healthily.   If you have access to a first world grocery store and the internet, you can be a healthy vegan."
Vegetarianism,24q2nu,tctu,3,Mon May 5 15:59:16 2014 UTC,"I beg your pardon, I meant ""without spending all of my money"". In addition, I live in France, which, whilst being first world, is not a very vegan friendly country.  I completely agree that with the right resources it is possible to be a healthy vegan.

Vegetarianism,24q2nu,benjtrogdon,3,Mon May 5 17:07:00 2014 UTC,"Are you not in a living situation in which you can cook? Are beans, lentils, tofu, etc. really expensive there?

Vegetarianism,24q2nu,Buffalo__Buffalo,2,Mon May 5 17:23:51 2014 UTC,"most food here is expensive. I eat a lot of canned beans, but tofu and other meat substitutes are not widely available and when they are, they're far overpriced. no, there aren't vitamin shops, because the French don't have the same kind of attitude toward food and nutrients as we do. I don't mean this in a derogatory sense, simply that they eat what they eat. There hasn't really been much of a 'health food' movement over here."
Vegetarianism,24q2nu,PaddyPony,1 point,Mon May 5 17:27:42 2014 UTC,"but tofu and other meat substitutes are not widely available and when they are, they're far overpriced.   These aren't necessary at all. If you have legumes, you're good. I'm a broke vegan (not poor, but trying to pay down a lot of debt right now so I have to watch what I spend). Meat substitutes like Tofurky are a treat, not a staple. I'll eat tofu when it goes on sale for $1 a pound, but it's not a staple either. A lot of my diet is brown rice, lentils, and greens from my garden. I eat stuff like rutabagas, sweet potatoes, oatmeal, barley and bean soups, beets, cabbage... some of the cheapest whole foods I can find.     And nowhere you can even order B12 from? I have it at my local grocery store, but I understand cultural differences and all."
Vegetarianism,24q2nu,farouttothemax,5,Tue May 6 04:16:27 2014 UTC,"There's no reason to start a turf war: people remove animal products from their diet for many, many differences (see: the sidebar), and I don't think it's fair to judge either stance. Eat and let eat.  As a side note: Your friend sounds either incredibly controlling or immature, and you should never let someone control your diet. While many vegetarians and vegans made their choice based on friends' advice or feedback, no friend should disrespect your choices like that. No lifestyle will stick if you're being held to it by someone else."
Vegetarianism,24q2nu,TeaMistress,5,Mon May 5 02:33:25 2014 UTC,"Lots of really great responses here!  The reaction you got from you friend is (in my experience) similar to what you might see (from some posters) on /r/vegan. Many people are really passionate about their beliefs and have a hard time seeing the eating ethically, including being vegan or vegetarian, is a difficult life transition. I totally get their perspective - they just really care about the ethical implications of our diets - but we live in a society that's imperfect and is generally a bit hostile to our lifestyle.   So yeah, some will say ""if you can't go vegan, why bother at all?"" Others will be like some of the posters here and commend you for making the effort. Really, it's all about doing your personal best and building new habits, which is best done slowly so you don't get discouraged and quit. Try new foods, explore new restaurants or dining options, and just have fun with it. For example, you could make vegetarian dinner for friends or family sometimes or try out cooking one new recipe every week. Eventually, you may even find that cutting a few extra things from your diet isn't that hard."
Vegetarianism,24q2nu,nudeinmylivingroom,5,Mon May 5 06:43:24 2014 UTC,"Tough question. Like with most vegans, I started out as vegetarian, after eating and loving meat for 30-odd years of my life. For me it was primarily an ethical motivation, after becoming disgusted by my own hypocrisy of being appalled at the video footage of factory farming and not doing anything about it.  But then I learned about the dairy and egg industries, and I came to the conclusion that those are at least as bad. In fact if I were forced to choose, I would choose the life of a beef cow over that of a dairy sow, a relatively quick death compared to a lifetime of utter agony.  But not all vegetarians are vegans in the making, of course. Some do it purely for health reasons (although the increased intake of dairy products typical in vegetarians is not particularly healthy either), some do it for ethical reasons but haven't (yet) come to grips or awareness about the dairy and egg industries, or aren't persuaded enough to take the jump to veganism.  Or some would like to be vegan but find it too difficult. I'd be lying if I said it's easy. Being vegetarian is relatively easy, enough pizzas to choose from, for example. Vegan pizza in an Italian restaurant is basically non-existant. But my own inconvenience is less important than my morals. So I try as much as possible to live by them. To each his own, of course. But I think everyone should think about what they eat, why they eat it, and if they feel strongly about something they must take some form of action to make a change if possible."
Vegetarianism,24q2nu,swirly023,5,Mon May 5 13:56:06 2014 UTC,"Vegan here. I think what ever you can do to reduce you consumption of animal products will help. You don't have to subscribe to a particular label, like vegetarian or vegan. For instance if being vegan in social situations or when you travel is to difficult, eat vegetarian in those situations, and eat vegan at home. Any reduction in animal products is positive!"

Strictly vegetarian for the past year and a half, and a lacto-ovo for 6 months prior to that. Its a journey.  What do I think of lacto/ovo's? They're fine. I wish they would go strict, but I don't really care all that much. I barely had enough care to muster a reply to this post =P"

Vegetarianism,24q2nu,bcore,3,Mon May 5 19:09:14 2014 UTC,"I admire people who are vegan for their commitment and dedication.  My only criticisms are the very rare evangelical/guiltmonger vegans, that it's actually very much a product of modern (Western) industrialized society and so it is contradictory to things like the philosophy of deep-green ecology and as such that it isn't necessarily the way to achieve animal liberation as it relies upon the very same foundations of industrialization and modernization that has animal instrumentality as a cornerstone, along with inherent exploitation and objectification of the environment and non-human life, and last of all that the motivation to be vegan can be based on effecting change in the world by making individualistic decisions as a consumer (Zizek speaks at length about this kind of prepackaged absolution mentality, and it's also fundamentally flawed approach to changing the structures that dictate our society in my view).  But those minor points of difference and the unnecessary philosophizing aside I'm very supportive of vegans and their aims, and I will defend their position and challenge straw-vegan arguments when I can.  Edit: I'm not afraid of shooting down pushy vegans/vegetarians.   Don't eat all the vegetarian pizza if you are a meat eater and don't attack me for my choices, and we'll be fine. But in the same way if someone who is veg starts getting sanctimonious, I'll put them in their place regardless of who they are picking on because it makes people dislike anyone who is veg because of negative experiences like that. And it does nothing to help the cause."

Being vegetarian is enough for me.  I think going vegan is a cool choice for people who choose to do so and who go about it in a healthy manner. I've never personally encountered an extreme vegan but I have heard plenty of stories and I know that stereotypes exist for a reason.  I think that anybody who tries to push their beliefs on anybody else is a big asshole. Whether it's vegans to vegetarians, vegetarians to regular omnivorous people, or that dickwad who told me one time that I'd stop feeling sick if I just ate a cheeseburger. Anybody who tries to make anybody feel bad for what is or isn't on their plate can take a flying fuck at a rolling donut.  As far as you not being 'good enough' for your friend fuck that noise. You are good enough. And tbh it's not a good idea for most people to jump right into the veganism thing. It can be a real shock to your body and mind. It's generally better to stop eating meats one at a time. Then if you decide to continue to all dairy and animal products from there it'd prolly be easier for you mentally to stop things one or two at a time.   You decide whether you want to be vegetarian, vegan, or neither. It's your life and your body.  Edit: I forgot to mention that I have super respect for the will power and self control of vegans. The thought of life without melty cheese is just a no for me."

Tell her in no uncertain terms that your dietary choices are none of her damned business and the discussion is closed on the subject. If she wants to be vegan, that's her choice and more power to her. She does not, however, have any right to badger you about your choices.

Vegetarianism,24ouz4,mjpnitro,9,Sun May 4 12:55:42 2014 UTC,Humans are omnivores which means we have a choice in what we eat. Our ability to digest meat does not imply an obligation to eat it.
Vegetarianism,24ouz4,omegapisquared,7,Sun May 4 14:04:37 2014 UTC,"1) No they wouldn't. And even non-vegetarians have solid policies to keep near extinct species safe  2) We are definitely not carnivores, we are classified as omnivores and neither of those things describes what we are supposed to eat. That classification doesn't really work either, great pandas are carnivores but live on bamboo, it's a very simplified trait and should be treated as such.  3) There are so many animals just because we breed them in large numbers. Since we have control over their breeding, solution couldn't be easier - breed less of them.  To add some more as you requested:   ""Why do we have canine teeth?"" -> Even herbivores such as goats, male horses and mountain gorillas have those. We are descendants of primates and they use them to communicate (aggression, fear). And you use them on vegetarian diets as well, I challenge you to open shy pistachios without them ;) ""We use more resources on vegetarian diets, harming the ecosystem"" -> That couldn't be further from truth, even when you take digestibility into account, you lose ~90% of input energy when feeding animals. About 70% of all agriculture production is used to feed the animals, to power their biological system and produce heat, it simply cannot be more effective. ""Plants/bacteria/fungi have feelings too"" -> See answer above, you kill much less plants than meat eaters   If you need any help with proper argumentation, feel free to ask or PM me any time :)"
Vegetarianism,24ouz4,M4124124,5,Sun May 4 14:24:13 2014 UTC,"1) The animals would be extinct if we didn't farm them.   Native, wild animals ARE going extinct because we are using so much land for animal agriculture -- animal agriculture of just a relatively small group of species that are domesticated and so dependent on human care that some can't even breed without our help. I think it would be totally find for such animals to go extinct, especially if it meant that free living animals could live on.    2) We are carnivores, we are supposed to eat meat   We're not carnivores, we're omnivores. Carnivores have a meat-based diet and have to eat meat. Omnivores have more of a choice, and humans in particular have a lot of choice, especially those of us living in advanced enough areas to have access to things like Reddit! We can definitely be healthy and happy without eating animal products at all! That means that continuing to eat animal products (not just meat, but also dairy, eggs, honey, etc.) is a matter of taste and convenience, but still needless suffering.    3) If we didn't eat animals, they would overpopulate   Most animals that people eat are domesticated animals that we specifically breed. These animals ARE overpopulated and taking resources that wild animals could enjoy, but because we choose to breed them. Animal agriculture is extremely wasteful. Did you know that a pound of beef takes about 2500 gallons of water to produce? That's a year's worth of showers! Plant food alternatives are a lot easier on water than that!"
Vegetarianism,24ouz4,panda8bamboo,2,Sun May 4 19:20:33 2014 UTC,"thanks, this a really interesting and straight forward answer to read."
Vegetarianism,24ouz4,Zyclunt,3,Mon May 5 18:41:43 2014 UTC,"Extinction of an animal is only a bad thing because it disrupts the environment and food chain. Farm raised cattle are so far removed from the natural order, it's not really comparable. They are mostly having a negative impact on the environment already due to sludge and farm waste, they aren't contributing to the food chain (absent humans) because we provide them with all their food and then take all their meat. So mostly I'd say, let them die out, nature wouldn't miss them.  Besides, I doubt they actually would go extinct. Do your friends seriously believe every single person on the planet will stop eating meat?   As for your second point, it's a naturalistic fallacy. Just because we evolved in a certain pattern of behavior or diet isn't reason alone to continue it. I like to ask them if men should hold women in subjection and rape whenever we have the opportunity. We evolved to do that too."

My concern is that Buddhists in China might not be as strict about vegetarianism as we are. Perhaps they're okay with meat-based broth, for example, or flavoring with fish sauce."
Vegetarianism,245iaj,Zlatty,1 point,Mon Apr 28 03:22:39 2014 UTC,"I'm a vegetarian because I'm Buddhist, and I don't really think we're less strict. Normally they don't use anything something died for (unless they are a monk of a certain sects that eat only donated food, but I'm imagining you are not going to suddenly become a monk.)   Even if they are more relaxed they will be very open about making foods without meat products for you. As a rule of thumb, if they are strict enough Buddhists they are vegetarian normally they are pretty nice and kind people, so you probably won't get any of the normal humpfing about you being picky or whatever.  Though do be careful about rice in China. It's almost always cooked in meat broth for flavor and a lot of time they won't realize that that's a problem for you (I mean non-veg places, veg places should know better.)"

Vegetarianism,240ueq,Tdaug,8,Sat Apr 26 10:44:51 2014 UTC,"I follow a fruitarian diet, but I'm not all crazy Willie nillie with juices and stuff. I just eat mass amounts of fruit and raw nuts during the day, and have a meal at night with my family.   (watch me get downvoted for that).   You work at McDonald's?   Food, like fast food, and lots of boxed processed foods, have additives that are addictive, and trigger the addiction and pleasure centers of the brain.   It's what makes your mouth water when you see a mickey ds commercial on TV, what makes you want that. Your brain is chemically wired to ""want"" it. The environment, the smells, the uniform when you put it on, are all unknown triggers that activate the addiction and pleasure center in your brain saying ""you want this!"".   The only way to stop wanting it, is to stop eating it. The first 3 months are the hardest.   Start eating the salads. Bring your own nuts, or beans or quinoa to add to it for your protein, so you're not missing out on your nutrition.   Remind yourself what your goal is. Health? Animal rights? Both? Whatever your goal is, remind yourself. Wear a bracelet.   Also, keep a journal. Write down when you felt the urge to eat it, and why you decided not to. Sounds cheesy, but after a week, go back and read it. You'll be surprised at what you learn about yourself.   Don't be hard on yourself. Don't go heave Ho Veggie all at once. Plan a vegetarian day. Then plan two. Gradually step your way into it. Going full on double rainbow can really cause you to take a few steps back. Don't force it. Ease it. Just tap it in.   And last, build a support group. Here, online  personal friends you can talk to when you're really having a tough day getting this Veggie thing on. Any life changing event is going to be difficult, and everybody needs a hand.   Good luck, and let us know how you do!"
Vegetarianism,240ueq,Quorraline,2,Sat Apr 26 11:29:44 2014 UTC,"This is very true.

Vegetarianism,240ueq,no_you_cannot,2,Sat Apr 26 12:28:07 2014 UTC,"I really like this advice. If going cold turkey doesn't help I recommend limiting eating meat to a couple times a week rather than every day and slowly taking a day off. You kind of mentioned it but in reverse.   So to add something that helped me become full veg and might help OP I watched my friends eat their burgers, listened to the sounds, and payed attention to the smells. Which really disgusted me and turned me off to meat. And I work at a theme park, and when the area is crowded with guests they turn on some vents that blow out specific smells to entice you to come eat that ice cream, that burger, that waffle, the hotdog, or whatever it is they're selling. At first I thought ""omg I'm so hungry for that!"" every single day. But then I really thought about the smell and it started smelling pungent and unappetizing to me, because the lunch I brought smells so much better. This thought process may work for you? Or I'm just weird.  Edit: Oh and to help track what you eat I recommend http://www.myfitnesspal.com/"
Vegetarianism,240ueq,willlma,3,Sat Apr 26 14:46:25 2014 UTC,"You'll get a lot of different advice here, but I started by restricting myself to three meat meals a week. It was tough at first, but it became a special occasion, I valued those meals more for it, and the cravings just went away with time; the less you have it, the less you want it (over several weeks). Now I eat meat about once or twice a month and sometimes I go a couple of months without eating meat without really noticing."
Vegetarianism,240ueq,Quorraline,3,Sat Apr 26 14:58:20 2014 UTC,"Well, and correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't a fruitarian diet very different than vegetarianism? Plus, Jobs was a visionary but certainly had some questionable ideas about his home life so idk if I'd take inspiration from him.  To be honest, if you don't cheat and eat meat the cravings will stop anywhere from a few days to a month after day one normally. If you do cheat, they will never stop because your body will never acclimate.   Is it the flavor or the texture? Because the texture, to me, is gross to think about now. The flavor is too, but I know you can get that in those gross frozen vegetarian entrees.   Speaking of those you can use those to sort of wean yourself into vegetarianism but I don't recommend eating them regularly after you taper off of them in the first month or so. Not only are they not very tasty (too much like meat and preservatives for me) but they basically are just as bad for you as the frozen meals with meat, just without the meat of course. So I guess it's better to eat the veg frozen ones, but it's better to just not eat them at all.  When I really want a ""hearty"" meal I usually go for something bean-heavy. It'll give you the same feeling of fullness and general stuffed-ness that a large meat dinner, but better tasting and better for you. Plus, there are a lot more beans out there than just lentils, experiment! Lot's of cultures' cuisines are bean-heavy and are mostly veg, so find really cool new bean recipes are always easy.  People normally say kale is very hearty blah blah blah. I hate kale, but everyone else seems to like it so... try it.  But I really think the biggest thing is no cheating at all. Every time you cheat in the beginning especially you are basically starting over craving wise. Plus like I said I don't see how fruitarian can be nutritionally possible so that probably was making your cravings much worse."
Vegetarianism,240ueq,cocoalrose,1 point,Sat Apr 26 10:55:57 2014 UTC,"I follow a 90% fruitarian diet.   Lots of people forget that fruits are also tomatoes, cucumbers, avocado, bell pepper, etc. Also, sometimes beans, or rice or quinoa, Chia seeds, flax seeds, and nuts."
Vegetarianism,240ueq,cocoalrose,1 point,Sat Apr 26 10:57:39 2014 UTC,That sounds better. I was imagining someone only eating berries or something. But I still feel like someone just starting would probably struggle with that.
Vegetarianism,240ueq,cocoalrose,0,Sat Apr 26 11:34:06 2014 UTC,"Fruitarian diet is essentially vegetarianism without vegetables.  Strict fruit diet, with nuts and seeds as well.  It's a half and half shot whether you'll be super healthy or develop pancreatic cancer and die horribly, so I'm sort of glad that diet failed :P  Mostly the texture I guess, I don't normally eat through flavor since I have a hard time tasting so I guess it'd have to be more texture for me.  Do you have any advice about expanding palate?  Another problem for me is an unwillingness to try new things and it's a difficult cycle to break; ""I'm going to become a vegetarian!  Oh, but I don't really eat that many vegetables and I wouldn't have a very varied diet... I'd better just stick with what I know...""   I can tell people to change for the better all I want but I suck at taking my own advice :P"
Vegetarianism,240ueq,cocoalrose,1 point,Sat Apr 26 12:11:28 2014 UTC,"Expanding palate.... Well what exactly do you like now (including meat products?) I could tell you things that are similar on the vegetarian side. I have a huge thing with trying new things and am normally the person that can tell what someone will or won't like.  The important thing is it's not just vegetables. You can dislike lots of the traditional vegetables and still be vegetarian. There are hundreds of vegetables, you just might need to grow them yourself, or buy at farmer's markets if lucky. Do you like mushrooms? To me they are what make vegetarianism do able but I know lots of people dislike the texture. Also like I said beans. If you don't like them 1) try another type and 2) learn to cook them differently because they are hugely important.   You could, like I said use the frozen entrees as a way to ease yourself into it. you know, buy enough for maybe one or two meals a day and make yourself eat one vegetarian recipe you made a day, that way you learn what you like."
Vegetarianism,240ueq,craccy,2,Sat Apr 26 11:05:23 2014 UTC,"I'm a big beef eater, and my diet when I work will usually just be a cheeseburger/fries at work, and then I won't eat for the day.  When I'm at home it's hotdogs, pizza (pepperoni), cheeseburgers, corn, beans (green), stuff like that.  A very immature diet that I've just had for years because when I was really little I got sick and the doctor said ""if he'll eat it and keep it down, let him eat it"", which led to fast food, mostly. The only vegetables I eat at this point are green beans, corn, and peas, and this really makes me feel sick to think about but at the same time when I'm in the moment and hungry, it's just normal to me.   And it's extra weird for me because I do like to cook unusual and diverse things, but for others and for myself I usually just get lazy."
Vegetarianism,240ueq,cursethedarkness,1 point,Sat Apr 26 11:13:38 2014 UTC,"Well you can supplement tofu crumbles anywhere you would need ground beef (in spaghetti sauce, sloppy joes etc.)   For hamburgers, there are a lot of options! You can use large mushrooms but the taste in those varies widely depending on how you season it or cook it. Also, there are your traditional soy/black bean burgers. you can make these yourself, which has the bonus of you being able to change for what you like (no worry of the raw materials being harmful! Go wild, haha.) Plus if you like burgers the morning star brand is probably the best of the pre-packaged ones, they have at least a dozen types of burgers from plain ones to weird ones like tomato and basil pizza! (Do not recommend that last one.)   I'm guessing no spicy food, if you've had the same diet since you were a kid. If you do like spicy food, Hot and spicy tofu is my favorite quick tofu meal. It's Asian in origin (or at least that's what my local favorite Asian restaurant says.) More traditionally, lots of brands have things like chik'n wings. They are fairly good if you suddenly get a craving for some, since I can't figure out how to make them from home veg.   Pizza is very easy to make veg. I'm assuming you like cheese. Using different types (when making homemade pizza) adds some depth to the flavor. There are as many types of pizzas as there are sandwiches, so don't feel limited to plain old red sauce and cheese! I just had a humus and olive pizza (prob not your thing) and it was awesome. You can make your own little pizzas with pita bread, whatever sauce you like (barbecue sauce, sauteed tofu, and shredded white cheese is really good, and if you like barbecue you'll like it.) I really like banana peppers on like everything but especially pizza and they are only moderately spicy and cheap when pickled (the best way imo.)   Peas! You can do a lot with peas. Whole peas can be stir-fried with a basic soy sauce and some tofu and baby corn. Other things like water chestnuts could give it a nice crunch but I don't know if you'd like the texture.   You can actually make your own fries at home (bake them) and bring to work. This is especially cool, because you can have all sorts of flavors while your coworkers are stuck with slightly cold greasy twigs, haha.   Morning star again I think has veggie hot dogs but I have never had them as I am suspicious of them. But if you really craved a hot dog I'm guessing they'd work. Hey, I bet you could even make a chili sauce for the top with tofu crumbles but I have no idea how.  Have you ever made green bean casserole? It's very filling and even the pickiest meat eaters in my house can't wait till we make it. I can even give you our recipe if you want.  Nuts are great. I think I'm going to go on my favorite vegan comedian's youtube and link his video recipe for this kale-sunflower seed nut spaghetti thing. Sounds very weird I know but it's the only way I like kale!   Also listen to the guy down on the bottom of the post about the additives. It is literally addictive. You may for real go through withdrawal. It will be tough but when you live past 50 it will be worth it. Veg or not, for your own sake I would highly stress cutting them out. Cold Turkey.  Also, the top comment about slowly cutting meat out? Notice they still eat meat. You will not stop craving meat unless you cold turkey it too.   So I just wrote a book in response, haha. Sorry, just trying to help out. Feel free to ask about anything else!"

I was at a conscious crossroads.   Really, appalled? The price we pay for ethically slaughtered meat is a good indication of the actual cost of raising an animal and preparing it for human consumption without factory means.   Factory farming is reducing the price of meat to a commodity. This is an animal someone has had to raise from birth till death, not a commodity."

Although I do believe if the demand for ethically raised meat was higher then the price would indicate that. More demand would allow more farmers to make the shift back to holistic farming methods. I also mention that people consuming meat only a few days a week would be a good way to off-set high prices. We as a culture should reduce meat consumption and it wouldn't be a commodity."

Vegetarianism,227uqe,Exhibizionism,3,Fri Apr 4 22:51:18 2014 UTC,"Buy local is fine, organic is meh.  There have been no conclusive studies to show that organic food is better for you, or that genetically modified food is harmful. There are no true regulations which cover whether something is organic or not. Most of the organic foods you're purchasing are owned by large corporations, and you're simply buying into the ""organic lifestyle"".   You're paying more more for essentially the same stuff.   In addition, organic foods typically are going to produce lower yields. This means the price of food goes up, which means countries which rely on food from places like the United Stats, are going to have a more difficult time getting that food. If using chemicals and pesticides means people in starving places get food, I'm all for it. Organic foods use pesticides too, just not with synthetic chemicals.   ----edit----  As we continue to use more and more water, we're going to have to continue to find more efficient ways to grow the food we need. There's a hard limit to the amount of food that can be grown ""organically"". As a matter of survival were going to have to use science to improve yields and grow crops that are more robust and can survive the turbulent climate we're starting to experience. I love the idea of eating wholesome, nutritious vegetables and fruit. And I don't think that has to change simple because it was not grown in the most inefficient manner as possible. It's the same logic that people try to use to not get vaccinated, and here we are with outbreaks of diseases that we eliminated 60 years ago."

Vegetarianism,227uqe,mj8,3,Sat Apr 5 14:16:00 2014 UTC,"I'm saying that most if what people are worried about with pesticides can be eradicated by simply washing foods. Genetically modifying foods I am totally for. It increases yields, decreases disease and allows for crops to be grown on arid lands, a major asset when it comes to places like Australia, India and Africa. There have not yet been any (as far as I have seen) conclusive studies that GM food has negative effects on the human body.   Crops need pesticides to survive. In a world where the human population is growing exponentially we need to work out the quickest most effective way of growing crops resistant to pests and diseases. This is where GM comes into the argument. It is beneficial in numerous ways and needs to stop being avoided. I feel the same way about anti-vaccination lobbyists. There is LITERALLY no sources to suggest that vaccinations lead to autism so why avoid them when they do so much good."
Vegetarianism,227uqe,mj8,0,Sat Apr 5 17:08:44 2014 UTC,"http://www.unep.org/wed/2013/quickfacts/  Some facts about food loss. If we improved storage of food instead of food production, we wouldn't be needing food at all, and organic agriculture would be more than enough (even more so if people began eating vegetarian/vegan instead of meat). So I don't really buy your argument about yield at all. If more people started growing organically, the yield would rise exponentially.  In addition, you seem to only think of the health aspects when it comes to the food the person eats. Are you aware of the consequences on the environment of these pesticides? They are enourmous. Look into missing bees, groundwater pollution, general polution and energy usage on conventional compared to organic agriculture."

Vegetarianism,2233bu,bobbaphet,3,Thu Apr 3 11:31:40 2014 UTC,I thought veganism and plant based is on an upswing in Jewish groups at the very least. My SO's former boss is Jewish and they used a lot of dairy replacements such as dairy free ice creams as dessert and the like... and a lot of vegan friendly items are also marked halal and kosher as well.
Vegetarianism,2233bu,molecularmachine,2,Thu Apr 3 07:33:42 2014 UTC,"That is done to allow Jews to bypass Kosher rules. Such as mixing cheese with meat. If you remove the offending part of a dairy item, it becomes OK to mix the two."

My point was that it is very possible to be an orthodox Jew and be a vegan, in fact, a lot of Jewish people are vegan. Israel is quite quickly moving more towards veganism. An estimated 5% of the population being vegan and an additional 8% being vegetarians as of 2013.   Now... the thing we have to remember, as well, about the rules of Halal and Kosher as I understand some of them, is that they come from a different era, and a lot of young Muslims as well as Jews are adopting veganism as a way to, not only help animals, but also to live more closely to what they perceive these laws are about. (The uncleanliness of swine and the conditions even Halal chickens are factory farmed has been brought up in blog posts by Muslim vegans I have read, and the like)  I don't think animal welfare tops religious traditions. I do think that animal rights tops religious traditions, especially when those traditions and laws can very well be reconciled with a vegan lifestyle."

And once again, I really don't get how these two things could be compared.   Also I believe that initially 'Kosher' and 'Halal' were meant to be more humane than what people would otherwise do in the past.  I would venture to say that Veganism is the new 'Kosher'/'Halal' in that sense."

Vegetarianism,2233bu,mithrasinvictus,1 point,Thu Apr 3 17:16:54 2014 UTC,"Halal and being vegetarian is 2 different things. In places of pilgrimage animal slaughter is not allowed in Islam.  “…but to hunt…is forbidden you, so long as ye are on the pilgrimage. Be mindful of your duty to Allah, unto Whom you will all be gathered.”  —Koran, surah 5, verse 96  Islam teaches that in Mecca, the birthplace of Mohammed, no creature can be slaughtered and that perfect harmony should exist between all living beings. Muslim pilgrims approach Mecca wearing a shroud (“ihram”). From the moment they wear this religious cloth, absolutely no killing is allowed. Mosquitos, lice, grasshoppers, and other living creatures must also be protected. If a pilgrim sees an insect on the ground, he will motion to stop his comrades from accidentally stepping on it. Islam teaches respect for animals and nature; the Islamic tradition has much to say about humanity’s relationship with the animal world  So to my knowledge, all religions preach about compassion but no followers take it seriously"
Vegetarianism,2222od,ovadbar,7,Wed Apr 2 23:34:26 2014 UTC,"Most importantly? It's survey data.  The catch?  Vegetarians/vegans are two of the biggest groups who push survey-data based studies when the show positive correlations, but quicker to dismiss when they show negative ones.  The study? Shows correlations between Vegetarian Adults in Austria tend to be less healthy than those who eat meat & plenty of veggies/fruits (as quantified by cancer and heart attacks mostly).   What I've found in my life - People who are unhealthy and at cancer risk/heart risk are RECOMMENDED by doctors to adopt a vegetarian (or plant based) diet.    What does that mean?  Those people aren't necessarily unhealthy BECAUSE of their diet, but they SWITCHED To that diet to address their health issues.  So what looks like a causal relationship to the uninformed, may simply be explained by correlation.  I know a LOT of people who are like this.  They have health troubles, and doctors suggest reduce meat intake, increase veggie intake, etc.  If you looked at the data of such people you might think ""WOW those vegetarians have a lot of heart disease!"" But you might actually be looking at people who had heart disease, but then SWITCHED to a vegetarian/vegan diet by their doctors.

Therefore, no statements can be made whether the poorer health in vegetarians in our study is caused by their dietary habit or if they consume this form of diet due to their poorer health status. We cannot state whether a causal relationship exists, but describe ascertained associations.   In other words it is very likely that many of these people were already in poor health when they ate meat and became vegetarians to try to combat that, but since the study didn't take that into account it ends up being very misleading."

Vegetarianism,21iq3x,InfiniteHatred,4,Fri Mar 28 18:11:03 2014 UTC,"If you consume dairy, dairy is great for building muscle. It contains whey protein, which is an anabolic (muscle-building) protein, and it contains casein protein, which is an anti-catabolic protein (it prevents muscle breakdown).  Eggs are also good for building muscle if you eat those. They are not as suited to build muscle as effectively as dairy, but they work well regardless.  When you work out, your body will want to burn carbohydrates for fuel if they're available, and if they're not available, your body will tend to burn the proteins in your muscles, so eat plenty of starchy vegetables around your workouts. Tubers are fantastic for this purpose, so load up your plate with some baked potatoes, sweet potatoes, yams, or what-have-you. You can also opt for legumes and/or grains. Various fruits are also good sources of carbohydrates, but be aware that they don't offer much protein.  While protein is necessary, you don't really need as much protein to build muscle as the various fitness magazines and personal trainers (both of whom tend to make gobs of money selling supplements and ads for supplements) might lead you to believe. Mostly you just need to eat more energy than you expend and challenge your muscles with high levels of tension, and be sure to get plenty of rest."

Get peanut butter, if you're not allergic, and if you are allergic, opt for almond butter or sunflower butter. Get the kind that's enriched with Omega-3 fatty acids, but avoid the hydrogenated oils and refined sugars. Spread it on fruits, bread, or even eat it plain.  You can also try to add some calories to your usual meals by adding a tablespoon or two of coconut oil. Opt for extra-virgin, cold/expeller-pressed, and non-hydrogenated.

If you haven't eaten any/enough carbs for a good while, you will start to convert proteins into glycogen to feed your muscles and organs, which is rather inefficient (hence carbs are the priority). Fat is basically the lowest priority fuel because it takes the longest time to break into glucose, but it is the best source of energy when you are at rest and haven't exerted yourself for a while.

Vegetarianism,219w6c,Hsankt,7,Mon Mar 24 23:23:45 2014 UTC,"I did the same thing 'til I went to college.  It was pretty easy to tell them, when it didn't mean telling them that they had to buy different groceries and cook special food for me.  They came to accept it fairly quickly.  I told my parents on April first and I thought that they would think it was a joke, but my dad's initial response was ""do you want me to pick up anything special the next time you come home?""  It did take a few months of them making me defend the ethical reasons behind the decision and demonstrate that I could still be healthy, before they fully accepted it.  Overall, I think that was a good and healthy thing.  That was fifteen years ago, and I haven't looked back.  I went vegan a year ago, and that was a little more difficult for them to understand at first, but after 14 years, they really didn't care all that much.  If/when you tell your parents and you are navigating their reaction, keep in mind that eating is a very central part of individual and cultural identity and it is a powerful way of building social cohesion.  They may have negative reactions for a number of reasons.  One of the most common reasons I have found are from what Freud called ""the narcissism of small differences,"" which is our tendency to take other people's choices or behaviors as an implicit critique of our own (If I ate meat, I might experience your decision not to as a critique of the fact that I do, something that may be a really important part of my identity).  The other reason is because people want to be able to share meals with you (especially your friends and family) and they might feel like your decision makes that harder for them.  Reassuring them that it is still possible, and volunteering to cook (either for yourself or for everyone) can go a long way toward easing their fears on this front, if it seems like it is an issue.  Best of luck!"

Vegetarianism,219w6c,shelbshelbz,3,Thu Mar 27 03:42:20 2014 UTC,"The best advice I can offer is try bringing it up with whichever parent does the most cooking first.  It doesn't have to be a serious, sit down talk.      Say you'd like try to cutting meat out of your diet and offer to cook along side that parent and learn to make your favorite meals meat-free with vegis or a meat substitute (also offer to come on shopping trips to pick stuff out if they offer/ask about fake meat or tofu so you can figure out what you like).    The point of all that?  Offering to help will keep them from having to double the amount of work spent cooking/shopping (which will be something they appreciate) while you also become self sufficient and learn your preferences as a vegetarian.    If you make the effort, they'll hopefully be more respectful of your choice while you also save yourself from a painful few years of too many sandwiches and pasta meals (it's surprisingly easy to gain weight when you first go vegi).    Worst case scenario is they don't take it seriously/don't support it and you still pick meat out of your food like you do now.  Good luck to you!"

Vegetarianism,219w6c,-fd-,2,Tue Mar 25 12:34:32 2014 UTC,"I told my mom I was going vegetarian almost two years ago now: I just said I was no longer comfortable eating meat and I wanted a healthier lifestyle full of fruit and vegetables. She had her reservations, and jokingly once or twice told me she'd make me eat a cheeseburger if I started looking sickly, but otherwise she's been very supportive.   If you've been picking meat out of your food your family might have already noticed something was up. I think the important thing is that when you tell your family, give concrete reasons for your choice and reassure them that you don't expect them to change their dietary habits just because you have. I've found that family and friends alike respected my choice not to eat meat as long as I respected their choice to consume it. Perhaps you'll find the same result with your family?  Oh, and if you do choose to come out of the vegetarian closet, offer to make veggie foods for your family once in a while: I make a vegan banana bread that gets gobbled up almost faster than I can bake it, and a spinach-tofu lasagna recipe that's as satisfying as it is delicious.  tl;dr: Your family may be concerned at first, but it's only because they love you. Respect their choice to eat meat without you and offer to show what great food they can have without meat and you should be fine."

Vegetarianism,215r9u,fruitblender,7,Sun Mar 23 17:23:33 2014 UTC,"Not a vegetarian totally, I guess you would call me a flexitarian?, but I cut back on meat A LOT because of environmental reasons. I won't even touch beef now at all. I do eat seafood occasionally, I live in AK so I have a lot of local choices when it comes to fish. While AK stocks local carrots and potatoes all winter, a lot of my favorite veggies/legumes have a pretty sizable carbon footprint associated with them by the time you get them shipped here. Eating a little fish every now and then is probably actually reducing my carbon footprint. Also, I like to show a little support for the guys who do it right. If the sustainable fisheries don't profit, what incentive do people have to be sustainable?  That being said, I'm VERY careful with which kind of fish I eat/buy, I check the label very carefully. I use these seafood pocket guides (they also make an app if you have a smart phone, which is better because they are constantly updating) from the Monterey Bay Aquarium that tell you which fish from which locations and catch methods are currently sustainable, good alternatives, or bad choices. Like I said, they're constantly updating though, so if you have to go the pocket guide route you'll want to get a new one every couple months. Also, some seafood is listed in more than one column, which is something to watch out for!   http://www.seafoodwatch.org/cr/cr_seafoodwatch/sfw_recommendations.aspx  The ecologist in me also recommends this TED Talk, it's an incredible story about a sustainable fishery and the chef who realized sustainable fisheries are better for everyone.

I figure that even if I was really putting an effort into it as long as I wasn't catching more than I could eat it would be pretty sustainable, and the reality is that I have gone fishing once in the past 5 or 6 years and been much longer than that for hunting or scavenging.  I wouldn't trust any sort of sustainable label though, even from green peace.  The truth is that a lot of those labels get watered down sooner or later and its not worth the effort for me to figure out the difference between phrases like grass fed or grass finished as far as production practices go when I could just as easily avoid something all together."
Vegetarianism,215r9u,funchy,2,Mon Mar 24 02:47:41 2014 UTC,"Can someone explain to me more about these ""sustainable"" fishing practices?    How do they avoid the horrible waste of by catch?     How do they not harm species that prey on the fish in question?   I understand they take smaller numbers.

Vegetarianism,215r9u,myrmecophily,2,Mon Mar 24 03:17:10 2014 UTC,"A certain species of fish wouldn't be considered ""sustainable"" if by catching it we were killing other species that depend on them, that would be considered unsustainable.   Catch methods are also described as sustainable or not, sustainable methods involve using methods that are more specific to what you're trying to catch. Also, by avoiding fishing in areas that are used by sensitive species, detrimental by-catch can be avoided. On top of that, a lot of fish is farmed, in which case by-catch isn't really an issue.   TEDs (turtle excluder devices) can be used on fish nets, they allow organisms that are not the appropriate size to be pushed out (too small slips through, too large can't slide through and pushes the device in a way that provides an exit for the turtle).  Also, oceans are full of many populations of the same species of fish. Overall, the species might be declining, but there are some populations that are flourishing, which allow for sustainable fishing to take place on those populations.   Some areas have MPAs (marine protected areas) where fish are not touched inside, but once the population gets really big and they fish start spilling out of the protected area, people are allowed to fish them. This is good for both fishing and the fish, everybody wins!  http://www.seafoodwatch.org/cr/seafoodwatch.aspx"

Vegetarianism,215r9u,coolgherm,0,Mon Mar 24 01:41:33 2014 UTC,"Sustainability is a balancing system. Sustainable fisheries are placing quotas on depleted fish stocks. However, if only a handful of companies follow these quotas, and the rest of the companies are not, then the rest of the companies are killing more fish than what the quotas call for. Therefore, even though those sustainable fisheries are following the quotas, the quotas are meaningless because all the other companies are overkilling. The system is off balance, and the sustainable fisheries are just adding to the off balance.  The only way sustainable fisheries would work is if every company agreed to follow the system. Then and only then, would it do any good. People argue that well, if you support these sustainable fisheries, then their revenue will speak for itself and other companies will switch. This could work in the long run maybe if there were enough people who gave a fuck about fish populations (which I doubt there are) but fish populations simply don't have the time for that. Fish populations are going extinct now and it is a far better choice to not eat fish at all than it is to eat sustainable fish. That is my argument."
Vegetarianism,215r9u,myrmecophily,1 point,Mon Mar 24 01:55:47 2014 UTC,"Part of the problem  with this argument is that the ocean is not one giant fish population. There are many small populations that comprise the ocean. Some of these populations are flourishing, even though overall the species can still be declining.   There are areas set up in the ocean (not nearly enough of them, but they are there) where fishing is not allowed. The fish are safe there, but because they are safe, they reproduce and reproduce until they don't fit in the protected area anymore. People fish from the outskirts of the marine protected area, which is considered sustainable. That population is in  no risk of decline from people fishing off of the ""spill over"".   Also, some fish are farmed. Those fish are closed off from wild fish, meaning that as they can be defined as sustainable as long as they are not polluting or damaging the ecosystem in another way."

Vegetarianism,20pkmf,KyleDComic,5,Tue Mar 18 11:13:24 2014 UTC,"Try to get plenty of umami flavours to get the meaty flavour. This list of vegetarian sources of umami was posted a few days ago. I find cheese is the best. If you really find yourself having a meat craving, I find grilled or fried halloumi cheese has the chewiness that many vegetarian products are unable to replicate. If somebody made bacon flavoured halloumi that would do a lot better at filling the bacon hole than those smoky bacon crisp flavour infused plastic oblong things that they claim are actual edible food.  If you're looking for recipes, Asian recipes are a good bet, as many people can't afford meat. For a recent meat eater, a good one to start with would be a mushroom or paneer (paneer is like halloumi but less salty, I genuinely think it's better than chicken in curries, it's more succulent) tikka masala as this is at least a little familiar (although I'm assuming you're not British, and I don't know how popular chicken tikka masala is with meat eaters outside the UK... it's apparently supposed to be our national dish)  Some Italian recipes are good too, as places like Sicily went through phases of having a lot of poverty, and so there are some great quick pasta dishes.  In terms of fake meat, the most convincing ones are the ones that pretend to be processed foods (sausages, burgers, nuggets, mince etc.). Anything that actually tries to be a ""steak"" or a ""fillet"" will never be able to get the texture right.  Basically, just hold on a few years, and there'll be lovely death free stem cell meat..."

Vegetarianism,20pkmf,craccy,3,Wed Mar 19 11:57:40 2014 UTC,"Yeah, pretty much what daiquiri said. Asian and Mexican cuisine are great places to start from.  Since you're taking your main source of protein out, I would recommend getting a copy of your country's daily food guide. Its a huuuge help in figuring what is supposed to be on your plate in order to keep healthy. Also makes it waaay easier to plan your meals!   I'm giving myself a crash course in Sri Lankan and Indian cooking. Easy once you get the hang of it and curries freeze wonderfully, so all you need to do is cook some rice.   Variety is key in a healthy vegetarian diet. It might be tempting to fill up from carbs because you won't be getting the same sense of fullness but don't! Mock meat is a good fall back while you're getting the hang of things. You might be able to spend a little extra on veggies since meat is off the menu. This lets me splurge on tastier organic everyday stuff. Eventually, try new things.   Experiment with different cheeses! Lentils and beans are fantastic for protein, as are nuts, eggs and cheese. Good luck!"
Vegetarianism,20pkmf,Pengaween,2,Tue Mar 18 14:53:41 2014 UTC,"You can have:  -Salad (A lot of people think that veg people just eat lettuce, but you can make some pretty extravagant salads with different kinds of lettuce, spinach, dandelion greens, tomatoes, olives, onions, cheese, eggs, etc.)  -Soup (I boil vegetables with a vegetable bullion cube, then blend the mixture when the vegetables are nice and soft to make a creamy sort of soup)  -Sandwiches (You can do cheese and veggies, just veggies, or a meat alternative like Tofurky)  -Pasta/Lasagna (Just omit meat or get a ground meat alternative like the one made by MorningStar Farms)  -Tacos (Try adding rice and/or beans instead of meat)  -Burgers (There are a lot of different vegetarian and vegan patties available at most grocery stores, and you can look up recipes to make your own)  -BLTs (Morningstar Farms makes a vegetarian bacon that even my omni partner eats and prefers over meat bacon)  -Salsa and chips (I mash up an avocado with my salsa)  -And garlic bread, and fried rice, and cereal, and oatmeal, and toast, and fruit salad, and corn on the cob, and much more!  Don't go too hog wild on the processed fake meats long-term though.  They're better than meat.  But they're still processed.  So they shouldn't be an ""every meal for the rest of your life"" kind of thing.  Don't go too crazy with bread and pasta either.    Try to get a variety of different things.  And try to get a lot of fresh produce.  Farmer's markets often have a lot of fresh produce for good prices in the summer.  You can also try growing your own.  Tomatoes and chives are especially easy and do well in pots.    If you don't cook much, try learning a few simple veg recipes so that you're not as tempted to get fast food or tv dinners.  When going out, some places are certainly more veg friendly than others.  But most places will have salads, some veg soup (be aware that a lot of broth is NOT veg, so ask first, even if it's a vegetable soup), mac and cheese, and grilled cheese (even if it is on the kids menu) at the very least.  And a lot of places will let you swap out a meat patty in favor of a veggie patty when it comes to burgers.  And a lot of places can omit the meat in certain dishes (especially pasta dishes)."

These are the two best ways to feed your body and soul, IMHO. :)  I became vegetarian 12 years ago but didn't do it cold turkey (no pun intended): I cut out mammals first; then, a year later; fish and fowl; six months later, I introduced fake meat (veggie burgers and the like) into my diet (by which time my taste memory of meat was less vivid and the substitutes wouldn't be so obviously fake).  I still add or subtract things from my diet regularly.  Bagged salads from the supermarket were a staple for awhile; now, not so much (I didn't really enjoy them without the dressing, which isn't the most healthful additive!).  For now, those simple, ready-made meals, like frozen pizzas or takeout, are a great introduction.  They may not prove either nutritionally diverse or affordable in the long run, though, so eventually you'll want to start getting creative in the kitchen.  Mexican dishes, like burritos, tacos, and enchiladas are great, as is Italian fare — you can put anything in a lasagna, manicotti, and the like.  Buy some vegetable stock at Trader Joe's and make some homemade soup.  Get creative with your sandwiches.  Or expand your breakfast choices into other meals — I love quiche for dinner.  I dedicated a full calendar year to trying at least one new recipe a week, with no repeats.  By the end of the year, I'd made 60 new dishes and had a better idea what I liked and how to feed myself.  It took time, for sure, but my stomach was happier for it.  I've found many vegetarian-specific cookbooks have some complicated recipes with ingredients I've never heard of, which can be daunting.  But allrecipes.com has a fantastic search engine that can be used to identify quick vegetarian recipes, and existing omnivorous recipes can be adapted to be vegetarian by substituting key ingredients (try Lightlife ground beef for tacos and the like).  Good luck!  Come back if you need advice or suggestions for either dishes or RiffTrax to try. :)"

And it brings you down to the level of your scumbag opponents.  Strategising about which kind of disingenuous crap might be most enticing to people is something various special interests shills do. Think Oil industry, GMO companies, AIPAC or any number of SI lobbies. They need to do this because they try to get away with UNethical acts.   Vegetarians seek no special benefit for themselves beyond trying to improve the world they live in, or at least to reduce some of the suffering in it.   Their public and actual rationales can and must be the same.  If the dialogue is kept both sincere and rational the ethical position always prevails. But if both are disingenuous, then the one with the most money for PR wins. So, an ethical line of policies doesn't need its public rationale to be separate from its actual rationale.

I also may not be the best judge because it has not been many years since my change and every 6-7 months I have consumed a single serving of meat.

While they take a little bit of effort, the Vegan Tamales I made were completely decimated, and the only food item to be completely eaten by the time we left 6 hours later.   We were the only Veg* people in the crowd of 25+, so I made a batch following the above recipe as well as a Black bean and cheese recipe for those that get down on the dairy.  I made the Masa and the Mix the day before I actually constructed and steamed the Tamales (having made a small batch test run 2 days before since you never debut a recipe the first time you make it), and just left them covered in the fridge overnight.  The Masa can be pre-rolled into little balls for easy portioning later, the balls easily spread across corn husks under a piece of plastic wrap if you haven't got a better tool.  Tamales are perfectly good frozen and then thawed in the fridge for use at a later date if you're into the bulk preparation thing, and though there is a little effort involved between soaking corn husks and such, it's not 'gross' to kids and non Veg* like Parmigiana often is;  The effort and result are great for pleasing the crowd since it's not a dish many people get to enjoy with any regularity."

Vegetarianism,1z0zwe,LaLaLaLa_Lola,0,Wed Feb 26 23:24:28 2014 UTC,"Because plants don't have feelings and they haven't evolved to ""want"" or ""not want"" us to eat them.   How can you say that? It has been scientifically shown that plants do experience in some form or another. When a plant is cut there are numerous, measurable, chemical changes. For all we could know this could be the plant screaming out in pain. A primitive nervous system perhaps?  Even bacteria itself has been seen to avoid noxious stimuli to get to food. So even bacteria may have consciousness to some degree.   The point is we cannot say for sure that plants aren't conscious to some level before defining consciousness itself. Nor can we say they have a ""want"" or ""will"". We just don't know. After all we are all just clusters of particles wondering around.  Arguably plants do ""want"". Look at fruit bearing plants for example. They want to reproduce and thus they bear fruit and they say ""Hey animals, eat my fruit"". So arguably fruit bearing plants want animals to eat their fruit to spread their young across the earth and promote biodiversity.  This is evolution, survival of the fittest in action. Arguably if it weren't for our initial ""want"" for reproduction and life we wouldn't have developed a brain, maths or science. And that can't have just popped into existence. It had to come from somewhere. For religious folk that place is their deity. For scientific folk, like myself, it must have come from the simple life forms that we evolved from over millions of years. So who are we to say whether a plant ""wants"" or not, when we ourselves came from them?!  Your second point however is much more valid. Good point :)"

That said, commercial farming of plants or animals can have devastating environmental effects. Whether it's the harvesting machines are unintentionally killing wildlife or the pesticides or pollutants... Unless you know exactly how your food got from where it was grown/raised to your plate, you can't really claim it is ethical.  Also, I don't know if jellyfish are even edible... But they don't look very delicious."
Vegetarianism,1z0zwe,MercifulWombat,1 point,Tue Mar 4 14:27:03 2014 UTC,"That's a good point. You'd have to take it from an ideal world where you did everything yourself. Though it is not practical it is really the only way to solve the problem. Because you can't control what other people do.  For example just because you played a part in something doesn't mean you are the cause of it. The AK-47 for example. The inventor, Mikhail Kalashnikov died recently and he had spent his whole life reflecting on the fact that he had made the weapon of choice for terrorist organisations around the world.  He wrote a letter describing his situation:  ""I keep having the same unsolved question: if my rifle claimed people's lives, then can it be that I... a Christian and an Orthodox believer, was to blame for their deaths? The longer I live the more this question drills itself into my brain and the more I wonder why the Lord allowed man to have the devilish desires of envy, greed and aggression""  Where am I going with this? Kalashnikov designed the AK-47. Yet he designed it with the intention of it being used to defend his people, and in his mind - for good. Therefore Kalashnikov thought that he was to blame for all those times it was used for bad. Kalashnikov was being ethically good. The eventuality was that his choice made ethically bad decisions down the line.  Thus Ethics is always an ideal. Kalashnikov's ideal was that this weapon would be used for good, and for good only. The reality of ethics is that ethical situations are impossible unless you do everything yourself. If only Kalashnikov had used the AK-47 then we can assume no bad would have come from it, only good, for example.  Thus ethics must always be on your own ideals.   And yeah… I don't think Jellyfish actually is edible, But one could also talk similarly about sponge and oysters. These are both extremely edible."

However, you aren't likely to find something that will replace, say, a fried/poached/boiled egg.  Regarding omelettes, my favourite eggless omelette is made from a batter of gram (chickpea) flour and soy milk with soft tofu mashed or blended in, seasoning and whatever veg you want. If you want a dish to resemble the taste of eggs, black salt is often used, but I have personally never tried it.  In things that use eggs functionally, their role is usually binding or leavening (or sometimes just moisture). For leavening (e.g. cakes), you can add extra baking powder (there are loads of different kinds of vegan cake recipes  but I will leave you to look them up). For binding, depending on the dish, and the flavours, you can use gram flour, soya flour, flax or chia ""eggs"" (ground flax/chia seeds mixed with water and left to go gloopy like eggs), mashed banana, avocado, etc.  Hope that helps. You will probably get more ideas if you post in one of the vegan subreddits."

Subsequently having to focus more effort into having a balanced and fulfilling diet and avoiding meat is or at least should be commended. Like I don't have a problem with meat eaters but it really is a more caring and ultimately superior position to not eat meat (morally). I mean honestly zoom out- to kill or to not kill. Thats it. I mean if you could ask that pig, who it thought was more superior- and if it could answer -I think everyone can agree it would say the the person who doesn't want to kill and consume it is 'superior'."

Vegetarianism,1x194h,urban_monk,5,Wed Feb 5 02:59:17 2014 UTC,"Tinned beans are worse than home cooked beans.  Soak your beans (better yet, sprout them!) for 24 hours - preferably something acidic. Maybe add a tablespoon or two of lemon juice. Then pressure cook them if possible.  Make up more than you need, freeze the excess and you will have easy pre-cooked beans on hand when you need them."
Vegetarianism,1x194h,Buffalo__Buffalo,2,Wed Feb 5 03:49:31 2014 UTC,Why acidic? I had always heard that prevents beans from getting soft if you add them early in cooking.
Vegetarianism,1x194h,Buffalo__Buffalo,3,Wed Feb 5 08:17:57 2014 UTC,"Soaking beans in something acidic helps to break down some compounds in them like lectins and generally make them more readily digestible. Soaking them in something with a lacto-culture helps even more (like a tablespoon or two of live-culture yogurt.) And sprouting them is probably the best way to make beans easily digestible.  I've never had trouble with beans soaked in acidulated water not softening up but maybe that's just me? As a bonus adding salt to beans before you cook them seems to make the skins softer  You might be getting hard beans because you are buying ones that are too old, or maybe pressure cooking is the x-factor here.   It might be worth making a post to /r/askculinary about beans, gas, softness an everything else because they are a much more knowledgeable bunch than I am."
Vegetarianism,1x194h,efmac,2,Wed Feb 5 11:13:45 2014 UTC,"A mildly acid solution (pH 5 or above) won't. A solution of pH 3 will hinder the cooking process quite a bit. (According to Christopher Kimball's tests, anyway.) Distilled vinegar is typically around ~2.5 and most undiluted fruit juices (including tomato) are around 3 to 5. So you'd have a problem if you tried to cook your beans down in a vinegar sauce or undiluted fresh tomato sauce, but you can add some acid to your soaking or cooking liquid without causing problems.  I'm not sure there's any benefit to it; none of my standby sources have mentioned acidity affecting digestibility. But it can be done."

Vegetarianism,1x194h,efmac,1 point,Sat Feb 8 06:34:23 2014 UTC,"If you're following a well-tested, trusted recipe (especially one with a brine soak), there are a couple environmental factors you could look at. Old beans may never soften; you may need a better source that rotates their stock more frequently. Hard water can also prevent even good beans from softening; using filtered water might make a difference."

Straight to slow cooker (6-9 hours on low) has also worked out for me. If I'm making a purée or refries, I'll skip the salt and add a bit of baking soda—a little quicker, but you get more burst skins and mush.  Honestly, so long as I can muster the patience, I've never had beans not cook through and get soft unless they'd been sitting in the back of my cupboard for a year. I distrust your water."

Best to do one, wait and see, then do the other.   Finally, beans are beans. Hard to get around that. Home cook them and if you have a Mexican market nearby, look for epazote (ep-ah-zoh-tay) a leafy herb that you can use to season them with and help with gas at the same time.

""I don't want an animal to die"" is kind of Level 1 Vegetarian reasoning, once you learn anything about it there are so many more reasons like inhumane treatment, energy waste, etc. and the priority of reasons is different for every vegetarian.   The ""we all die"" thing doesn't really work because we are no longer a hunting society; livestock lives because they are bred, and if they were not going to be eaten they would have never been born. It isn't as if we're speeding up the inevitable death of a naturally roaming animal, we are systematically sustaining a very high population of animals in order to consume them, with very high turnover of lives.  I'm really curious about what made you start being a vegetarian initially (in order to stop), in order for these kinds of very abstract ideas to change your mind. (Not to argue, I'm actually quite open to hearing.)"

In addition, to take a pro-suffering, pro-death stance and call it moral reasoning for meat eating doesn't make sense to me.  One  either doesn't think there is a moral issue with carnism, or one doesn't care about the morality issue.  But to say that the moral high ground is to kill and consume other beings just sounds like nonsense to me.  If you don't want to be a vegetarian anymore, just don't.

Vegetarianism,1x0qyj,Werewolfgirl34,-3,Tue Feb 4 23:54:14 2014 UTC,"My stance isn't pro suffering it's that it doesn't matter if something suffers, death is death and suffering is irrelevant. You may think that means I'm unsympathetic but im not, I simply recognize the value of all life regardless of capacity to suffer and consider it equal even without capacity for suffering.   Edit: also it seems your definition of beings excludes plants, my definition of beings doesn't.  Edit again: also, I care deeply about any form of life that exists. I wish we didn't have to make other living things die to live but we do have to, and saying you're better than me because the life you consume doesn't suffer just seems like a way around feeling bad that you are the cause of death to me because being the cause of any death makes me feel bad.

Vegetarianism,1x0qyj,stupergenius,5,Wed Feb 5 02:41:28 2014 UTC,"But suffering does matter.

I see suffering as a response our bodies give us to external stimuli that is usually damaging to our systems. It just means the death of some part of us, which I don't think is necessarily to be avoided. We see it negatively because we are wired to do so but I don't think that makes it inherently bad. And of course I think needless suffering is bad but I don't think the suffering an animal goes through when killed in a quick and effective way is any worse than killing a plant. I think suffering is bad because it alludes to destruction, which is the real bad thing, and that can happen to plants or animals.  And it's wrong the conditions animals are put in to support the current demand for meat and the torture they go through. Of course I think that's wrong, it's unnecessary and a better system where we only consume range free animals that are treated compassionately would be the only justifiable system. The current one is wrong, entirely. But I still don't think that makes eating animals wrong."

That would mean any animals found dead that could be consumed would rightfully be consumed as well though.   And I value life on a cellular level. Most people make plenty of arguments how that is ridiculous because more complex systems are inherently more valuable but I disagree. I find all life, no matter how large or small, to be of value. Maybe that makes me ridiculous, but if it does I'm fine with it.

Vegetarianism,1x0qyj,funchy,9,Wed Feb 5 20:26:13 2014 UTC,"I think that it's an interesting argument, but you failed to convince me that the systematic torture and killing of a massive population of specific animals is morally acceptable. I understand that plants may feel pain, but there's really no solid evidence for that while one only needs to watch a slaughter or scene from a factory farm to understand that there are beings in distress. How do you confront issues of unnecessary violence?   Further, what about other moral issues besides death? Responsibility to try to maintain or achieve a cleaner planet? Antibiotics? Workers' rights in factory farms?   Also I think that your argument could be a moral argument for murder and cannibalism. -  ""By removing the need to devour something we identify ourselves with very closely we can escape the destiny we all share. Or so we desire. In truth, we are running from the acceptance that life's purpose includes death."""

However, my point isn't about that, my point is about all life no matter how different or unlike our specific form of life being intrinsically of equal value, therefore removing the idea that vegetarianism is morally any more kind or good than being an omnivore.

People go to McDonalds to eat familiar food, not to try new things, especially when they involve a diet that most McDonald patrons may have at least a little prejudice against.  Vegetarian food can be so cheap, quick, easy, and convenient by itself without involving fast food giants, and it can be some of the most wonderfully tasting food you would care to eat.  It would absolutely break my heart if you were right, and all these people experienced their first vegetarian meal in the form of a nasty, processed faux-meat disaster from McDonalds that I'm sure would be in no way more delicious or satisfying to them than the regular burgers they are used to.  I think that would be extremely detrimental to the cause, for vegetarians to present their diet in such a way to people curious about vegetarianism.  In fact, I feel less now that it is an unnecessary indulgence, and more that we need to stop this from happening for the good of our diet's reputation."

Vegetarianism,1w26xx,Lz_erk,2,Sun Jan 26 19:39:22 2014 UTC,"http://i.imgur.com/pRiJA.png -- a little off topic, but I wonder how many people cite Peter Dinklage as a vegetarian inspiration.  At the risk of sounding conspiratorial [and why not], there are dozens of reasons to go veg*n, and they're all good, but only a targeted approach seems to be perceived as more than spam.  I've found anarchists, minarchists, and small business supporters are open to messages about meat subsidy's influence on taxes, politics, and monopolism. Anyone interested in health or weight issues is likely to take notice of the glycemic and cholesterolemic effects of pop cuisine, and may even take offense to how the snowballing extremism born of supply and demand has robbed them of other convenience options. Non-GMO and anti-monoculturalism folks are likely to consider the political, economical, and culinary impacts of the livestock feed situations [which I'd say is a case of supply creating a false demand, and people get mad when they're told someone else decided what they should eat!].  From your account history, you might be in the UK. I don't know how many of the above arguments could apply there, but I'd bet it's most or all.  For a message that can be distributed to strangers without chafing the veggie movement's image, I really don't know. Cute animal videos are usually well received, so there's the eye-splitting cuteness of Herbie. More to the point probably, some great webcomics approach the issue laterally, like Buni, and some [Couch Comics] meet it head on with information, emotional proximity, and comedy.  So this comment turned out to be a bunch of stream-of-consciousness garbage, but I'll call it brainstorming.  Good luck."

Also, I always assumed those steamer bags were more expensive than fresh vegetables? Organic or not doesn't make a huge difference, but if you buy fresh you can use as much as you like and in whatever combination!

Not sure where you are in the world, but keep an eye on what's in season and those will be the cheapest vegetables. Maybe you could replace rice with a grain like quinoa, or use wholegrain couscous (there's not such a big difference as with rice) or millet? Again, can be a little more expensive, but I think it's a small investment for the health benefits.  The easiest thing I find is to make your plate up of half vegetables, quarter protein, and quarter carbohydrate - but maybe you'll want to make those protein and carb sections bigger if you're exercising! The formula I normally follow is starch (e.g. rice or pasta) then a load of veg in some kind of sauce. So pasta and sauce, or rice and curry, or some kind of casserole... Just chuck in whatever you fancy.

Vegetarianism,1vvj83,catalot,4,Thu Jan 23 01:28:12 2014 UTC,"Tubers. Potatoes, Sweet Potatoes, and Yams. They're dirt-cheap and nutritious. In fact, one can (allegedly) survive indefinitely on nothing but tubers and butter. That can be very bland, though. Just a caution, don't eat any potatoes that have turned green or started to turn green, and remove any sprouts before you eat tubers; failure to do so might render you sick.  Bananas, spinach, kale, broccoli, onions, carrots, beans, and rolled oats (not instant) are relatively inexpensive, and most of it keeps a few weeks. If you need to make the leafy vegetables last longer, you can freeze them. Mushrooms can be hit-or-miss on price, but they're pretty good for you. I'd also suggest nuts for health, but they're relatively expensive, so just take it as a suggestion if you find an opportunity to splurge.  I'd recommend you cut back on pastas, cereals, and breads. Even when marketed as ""whole grain,"" they still tend to lose most of their nutritional value to processing, so actual whole grains, such as oats and rice, are a better choice. Still, tubers are an even better replacement for processed grains.  On a food prep note, if you want to steam your vegetables, you can get a plastic steamer pot, add water, and just heat in the microwave for a couple of minutes."

And about the pastas and cereals, I don't have too much of those. Cereal sometimes in the mornings, but if I have eggs I go with those before anything else.

Vegetarianism,1vvj83,macosxsealion,1 point,Thu Jan 23 15:57:18 2014 UTC,"You're welcome for the links.  I don't know that I've ever had steamed kale, but I enjoy the taste of kale regardless, so I imagine it would be like a less-intense, less-crisp version of the raw experience. Tubers come in a variety of colors and flavors, which are similar but usually distinct; although many times markets sell orange sweet potatoes as yams. As the name implies, sweet potatoes are a bit sweeter than typical potatoes, but they tend to have very high levels of vitamin A in the form of different carotenes. Generally, I would say tubers have kind of an earthy taste to them.  I would also recommend that you not worry too much about strict numbers in terms of carbohydrate. Not all carbs are created equal; some are downright poisonous (like fructose), some are fuel for every cell in your body (glucose), and others don't even absorb into your body at all (fiber and many resistant starches help to eliminate waste). Just try to get some fiber with your carbs, and make sure you get enough fats in your diet, especially Omega-3s, but anything other than trans-fat is fine."

Vegetarianism,1uw0om,BrownieBawse,10,Fri Jan 10 16:16:15 2014 UTC,"I ran into this problem after I became a vegetarian as well. The way I got around it was to add black strap molasses to my morning fruit smoothie. There is 20% of your recommended daily value of iron per tablespoon, and it solved my problem.  My wife, she's vegan, upped her iron by drinking spinach smoothies (also a good source of iron) but I just don't like the flavor."
Vegetarianism,1uw0om,floyding,6,Fri Jan 10 16:53:47 2014 UTC,"I would recommend your wife take a closer look at using spinach as a source of iron for several reasons.  1) From the wikipedia article on spinach that you linked above:    Spinach also has a high calcium content. However, the oxalate content in spinach also binds with calcium, decreasing its absorption.   Calcium and zinc also limit iron absorption. The calcium in spinach is the least bioavailable of calcium sources. By way of comparison, the human body can absorb about half of the calcium present in broccoli, yet only around 5% of the calcium in spinach.  In short, while it has a lot of iron in it, the body is not able to access very much of it because of spinach's calcium content, however...  2)  An even larger concern is that eating spinach interferes with the absorption of calcium because of its oxalic acid content, and as such can lead to osteoporosis and other bone density issues. Not only do you only absorb 1/10th of the calcium contained in the spinach, but eating the spinach in conjunction with other calcium sources (as your wife is doing in her smoothies) will greatly reduce the amount of calcium that you are able to absorb from those sources as well.  Her doctor or a nutritionist should be able to confirm what I've said  here. My advice is to switch to pretty much any other green than spinach for her smoothies, and there are tons to choose from. She will get a much bigger iron boost from her smoothies and assure that she is absorbing the maximum amount of calcium available from her food, which is vitally important."
Vegetarianism,1uw0om,TeaMistress,3,Fri Jan 10 17:44:42 2014 UTC,"Came here to inform about spinach as well. What I've been told (I'm no nutritionist) is that spinach is good if you have to lower your iron levels (there are medical conditions that makes it hard for people to get rid of excess iron).  And (don't quote me/check this up if you're interested) it's easier for the body to absorb iron if you combine it with vitamin C, like having a glass of orange juice with your meal.  I also understand it's harder to keep your iron levels proper as a female, having periods and such.  All this gets complicated quickly, and I really agree that the best person to talk to is a doctor or a nutritionist, and having your bloodwork checked regularly."
Vegetarianism,1uw0om,bjoernfan,1 point,Fri Jan 10 20:16:51 2014 UTC,"I didn't mean that her only source of iron was spinach, she simply enjoys it and it's part of her overall diet. Also, since she drinks her smoothie (currently at least) with orange juice as the liquid base (oj/banana/spinach/ground flax/molasses) she's not inhibiting herself from absorbing and major source of her calcium.  I do appreciate the response though."
Vegetarianism,1uw0om,floyding,1 point,Sat Jan 11 19:04:14 2014 UTC,"I just scheduled and appt with a nutritionist to help out. In the meantime, my doctor says I shouldn't take any supplements atm since I should be able to get my iron up by improving my diet.  I know for a fact vit C helps with iron absorption and I have heard that spinach is not as amazing as people might say. A friend doctor did tell me once that leafy vegetables in general are not too good as sources of specific nutrients since their absorbtion is not very good. Something about our intestines not being able to digest leaves properly.  We have a lot of chard where I live so I might try that instead of spinach.   Thank you so much!!"

Vegetarianism,1uv837,ishitgranola,2,Fri Jan 10 07:04:53 2014 UTC,"Meh. I don't really like this type of post.   First of all, one person being healthy does not mean it is representative. A meat eater could easily point out that the oldest person alive did eat meat and smoke cigarettes. A sample size of one makes absolutely no point.  Secondly, it is possible to be extremely healthy and eat some amount of animal/animal products. If proportions are kept in balance and a healthy lifestyle is lead, people have no problem being healthy.   Third, this dude obviously cared a lot about appearance, that's why he became a body-builder in the first place. So him looking good after a life of working on appearance is not so astounding.  Fourth, he says that he got much better after becoming vegetarian then vegan. I don't doubt that. I also don't doubt that if he was in the competing bodybuilding business, his diet was oriented toward muscle enhancers and the sort. Cutting out that was probably a healthy step on its own.  It's just my opinion, and whatever makes people reconsider their diet is good I guess. I'm just sad that actual reasons for eating less/no meat are in one sentence tucked at the bottom of the article."
Vegetarianism,1uv837,Kwizi,4,Fri Jan 10 08:59:36 2014 UTC,"I agree with a lot of what you said - especially the commonplace implications in such articles that ""X Diet = automatically healthy"" such as in this equating a plant-based diet with automatically being healthy.  That being said, as a vegan, I have met people who, after finding out I haven't eaten any animal product in years, literally commented/asked ""Wow, so people can live without?""  So, it does go to a good length to let people reconsider what glaringly illogical social norms they unknowingly abide under.    For that, I think it's good.  Also, I think he mentions it being spiritual in nature, that is knowing you are attempting to reduce harm to the utmost in something all humans do daily and MUST do - eat."

Vegetarianism,1uv837,Sawwaness,2,Fri Jan 10 15:26:30 2014 UTC,"I wouldn't ""Wow"" about the fact that you can live without an animal product.    Ah - gotcha.  I was referring more to people who have little or no exposure to EVEN the very idea that there are such people. The administrative assistant in my office is in her late 60s isn, she's the nicest lady in the world.  When I once mentioned to her someone at our event asked (not complained) if there was non-cheese-pizza that didn't have pepperoni, she remarked ""wow there's people who really asked that?""  So as odd as it is, there are so many people like this.  When I told my mom for instance, her remark was ""So... then what is there you even eat??""   I would ""wow"" that you managed to do it.    Gotcha, other than the tricky stuff (""White"" bone charred sugar, and other extremely tricky things that are hard to know), it's actually EASIER not to eat animal products... because anytime i'm at a party/event/get together, I can more easily avoid eating the ""junk"" sugar based snacks like sugar cookies, brownies, and such (because they will 99% time have egg and milk).    I've been vegetarian for awhile now and am working on being vegan, and I feel like animal products are in damn-near everything - things I wouldn't even consider.    Yep, Gelatin is a HUGE one just like that too.  marshmallows, cereals, frostings, candies, etc etc.    In a way, the plant-based diet makes it easier to avoid foods that are generally more processed/less healthy such as poptarts/candy/sugary snacks and such.   I'm always looking at the back of products wondering if any of those words are something fancy for ""bones"" or ""fat"" or what-not. =/   I think this is a challenge with food culture in general.  The fact that we take it as a ""bother"" to know exactly what's in our food says ALOT about how our culture accepts eating something that is packaged because ""hey, others do it, it couldn't be that unhealthy/inhumane/etc.""  Those secretive words are hard - but sometimes people do cook me foods/buy me lotions/other things that have honey or some other small thing like that in it.  Most times I just give it away, or use it if I really need it.  For instance, We got a free pastry at the Panera Bread near us, but ALL of them contain dairy/egg in some form.  So we got a cookie and gave it to my SO's boss because he likes cookies."

Isn't the whole FUCKING POINT of modern nutritional science that we know almost precisely what nutritional and caloric content the human body needs to function?  It doesn't matter where it comes from, animals, plants, lab-grown meat, synthetic supplements, your body will make use of it. He looks like this because he is a bodybuilder and in all likelihood eats exactly what is needed for him to develop a body like that. (yes I know I am simplifying a bit here)  If a diet of rocks and mud gave you all the nutrition you needed and alongside decades of targeted exercise you ended up like this, it still wouldn't be a compelling argument to eat mud and rocks.   Nobody who has ever done an iota of research has ever said ""I am not a vegan because I can't get the nutrition I need from the variety of non-animal products available"", because they would know very quickly that this is not the case."

For a humorous cartoon description of the steps involved in making bulgur wheat, click here. In contrast to cracked wheat, bulgur is ready to eat with minimal cooking or, after soaking in water or broth, can be mixed with other ingredients without further cooking. Bulgur can be used in recipes calling for converted rice (and it's more nutritious than rice).

Join groups like 350.org and be a vocal citizen. The personal practice of lowering carbon emissions is commendable, but mostly an empty gesture if your talking about actual influence on the biosphere. True, veganism helps with carbon emissions, if it becomes more popular then great but it will not be a quick societal transformation. The only thing that will make an actual difference will to be use democratic power to move political support away from extractive petrochemical industries and favor renewables (including next-gen nuclear) with existing subsidies, tax breaks and govt. purchasing. This would include a price on carbon that is also built into international trade agreements. If American, Canadian, Russian and Chinese citizens could work together on this, we might actually see positive change.   We are at a tipping point, both politically and ecologically, though the ecological tipping point is happening much faster. I doubt if we will be able to avoid serious impacts and the need for geo-engineering, I think people will get wise but I'm not convinced it will be soon enough.   I would just like to thank OP for caring... As I browse Reddit and see all this interest in the technological promise of the new millennium I am baffled how people can just ignore the dire warnings of the world's scientists that civilization is not guaranteed to survive this century.

And up until they have a lot of experience, by 9 or 10, they don't know what they want and their taste buds are extremely flexible and they'll make all kinds of terrible decisions. That's why they are minors, and that's why saying you'll let them make their own decisions is impossible. All you're doing is setting them up for a vague, nebulous fog of a life where nothing and everything is true. Your job as a parent is to declare what is true and what is not. You inculcate them with culture.  You give them food that is good for them and that becomes what they're used to. When they're old enough they will make their own decisions, and it is your job to know when that is and to manage it.  my kids are 10 and 13.

I am having the same discussion with my partner and he shares some of your feelings but I won him over when we discussed consent. Eating a dead body is a big deal if you really think about it.

If they ask why you eat meat and daddy doesn't, it's simple. You're an adult and you made the decision to eat meat because it's what was best for YOU and Daddy figured out what was best for him was not to eat meat. When they're older, it'll be up to them whether or not they eat meat but until then, since they're still young they won't be having any. Also it wouldn't hurt explaining your health situation to them in simple terms, by the time they're old enough to question this a lot they will be old enough to understand a hurt tummy and reacting to certain foods while others do not. You can explain that being vegetarian is very healthy and good for your body but not everyone can do it, because people are unique and have different needs. I work with children and the truth is that they love to hear the truth. They want you to speak frankly to them (just make sure your explanations are still on their level of understanding)."

When I was at school, some kids did make fun of me, and would occasionally try to trick me into or bargain with me to eat meat. Also at one point, a teacher told me, in front of the rest of the class, that my diet choice was very unhealthy. This may well happen to your son, so it's maybe a discussion to have with him before he goes to school. My parents told me what I would tell people if they asked, and this definitely helped.  I was quite an idealistic child anyway, and I stuck to my guns. The idea of eating meat always repulsed me, so there was no real question of it happening. My sister, however, did bow down to the peer pressure, and did eat fish occasionally from a young age. Now that we know she's lactose and gluten intolerant, this was actually quite a wise choice, if only to help her with meal options."

My son hasn't voiced any desire to eat meat (quite the opposite, actually) but I expect some social pressure to challenge him. Both my partner and myself stopped eating meat in our early 20's, so we never experienced being veg in elementary school. I'm wondering how long ago it was that your teacher told you your choices were unhealthy. I've had a few people say that to me since becoming veg and it's usually pretty easy to illuminate the fact that they don't know what they're talking about and are merely reacting because it challenges their own concept of what is acceptable as food. If one of my kids teachers said anything like that to them I think I might be inclined to question their objectivity and intelligence. How did your folks react (assuming they are vegetarian as well)?"

I'm always of the mind that vegans should redirect their anger at the institutions allowing such practices versus consumers for their genuine ignorance about it.

I just thought that was interesting, especially the part about not listening even if you agree with their arguments.  Personally, I think that any step towards reducing the consumption of animal products is a good thing, and many vegans were ovo/lacto vegetarians before going vegan. As /u/janewashington points out, some find it hard to understand why one would be an ethical vegetarian and still eat eggs and dairy. I'll admit that I sometimes find it hard to wrap my brain around now that I've made the connection, but I remind myself that I used to be in the same position, and not everyone is as educated about the dairy and egg industries. I do hope you'll put aside the anger you feel at this type of article and keep striving to eat less dairy :)   These are of special kind of vegetarians who want to put it as if being an omnivore is the most unethical food-choice you can make. If there's one thing that makes me angry about vegetarians it's exactly this attitude. We DO think about where our food comes from and some may end up living with vegetarian tendencies [may insert ""buying local humane meat"" here].

I don't want to listen to people who are so extreme about their attitude which are certain vegans, not all of them. Maybe I expressed that in a wrong way and I'm sorry if I offended any vegans in this thread.  I really think being vegan is a good choice and I will definitely continue to develop a more vegan lifestyle myself. In fact, I admire that they can do it, because being vegan (another ""omnivore argument"") seems to be so difficult, especially if you don't live in a big city where alternatives are more accessible. Our world is dominated by omnivores and the more different you diet is from that standard, the more difficult is it to find adequate food.  I mentioned in another thread how I feel like suddenly, every social gathering becomes a trip of ""Pizza? I don't eat cheese. Pasta? There are eggs in there... Does the salad dressing contain mayonnaise?"" I imagine people would look at you like you're a freak. They already can't understand vegetarianism, but that's simply more manageable that being vegan.  There are a lot of alternatives in cooking, but it becomes very difficult whenever you don't cook for yourself (where I live). My future approach, as soon as I move out, will be to cook mostly vegan and only consume dairy as far as the social aspect goes. Even though I realise that that may not be the most ethical choice, I see it as a move in the right direction.     I do think that articles like this really trigger the same anger in me like others in some omnivores who want to educate themselves on the subject. It sounds like we're all the bad guys and that's not the right approach to convince someone who has started to live a more ethical way of life or who wants to gather information about how to get started. I'd probably move to another website that's more objective about the matter to inform myself and just forget about sites like the one linked here."

Adulthood means being okay with that.   I think it is unfortunate that arguments for veganism seem to make you feel defensive.  If the majority of society is doing something wrong (treating animals like objects),  vegan arguments aren't personal statements about you.  I know it may feel personal,  but vegans are challenging the dominant approach to animals in our society.  It isn't about saying everyone who uses animals is a terrible person."

I am not a vegetarian myself, but I've had no problem taking my vegetarian / vegan friends out for a nice meal whenever they are in town.  Off the top of my head, my usuals are: 1) http://www.legrenierdenotredame.fr/  Expensive but good vegan food and good service.  2) http://www.saravanabhavan.com/restaurants.php?cn=France&cy=Paris&rid=54  Good vegetarian-only Indian food, decent prices, passable-to-terrible service.  3) http://choiseul.bioburger.fr/  Good burgers in general. Haven't tried the veggie-burger, but it looks to be better than what is offered at my favourite burger joint.  For more and better information, I would ask the friendly people over at these groups:  1) http://www.meetup.com/vegetarian-475/ 2) http://www.meetup.com/Paris-Vegan-Group/  Cheers and Happy Eating!"

Regardless, it is fairly easy to find vegetarian and vegan food away from big tourist centers, but it will not always be marketed as ""vegetarian,"" but rather ""biologique.""  As far as fully vegetarian restaurants go, Au Grain de Folie in Montmarte and Le Végétarien at rue Faubourg Poissonnière are just two of many options. You will find a lot of good options also in cafeterias lke Exki and Côme.  When you are a vegetarian or a vegan visiting Paris, the key is to look for restaurants marketed as ""bio."" A fully-vegetarian restaurant is less common, but ""bio"" restaurants will have so many options, it might as well be!   If you are staying a bit longer, or would rather buy groceries than go to restaurants :   The hardest thing to find is vegan cheese substitutes - there is one vegan store in Paris - Un Monde Vegan -http://www.unmondevegan.com/index.cfm  Otherwise, at any ""bio"" grocery store like Naturalia, Bio c'est Bon or La Vie Claire you can  find a wide offering of vegan and vegetarian options. These grocery stores are all over Paris-- just go to their websites and find one!  Don't be hesitate to PM me if you have any questions, or need a quick translation :)"

Vegetarianism,1sslzs,mymaterhi,6,Fri Dec 13 20:06:44 2013 UTC,"General tips for lazy vegetarians: Buy lots of chickpeas and lentils. You can buy them in cans if you don't want to cook them. If you cook them, cook them in large quantities so you can make different dishes with them for several days.  Anyway, here are some low-cost, student approved ideas:  Bean sauce tortilla/bread   Buy turkish bread, pitta bread, tortilla, wraps or something of that kind Optional: bake the bread in an oven (or a pan, you can use oil so it doesn't go black) Cut op some onions, start baking them in oil Add short cooking vegetables like peppers. The good thing is you can just turn the fire up from the beginning so you don't lose time cutting vegetables after the onions are in because you can do it at the same time. -Add tomatoes or just tomato sauce or some kind of spagetti sauce mix Add beans or chick peas from a can and optionally corn from a can Add feta Optionally: add spices of your choosing Put sauce on bread   Fancy lentil salad  Perfect for lunch and potlucks as well.  -Cook lots of lentils. Replace lentils by pasta for pasta salad, but lentils are cheap and have lots of proteins.  -While lentils are cooking, find stuff to add to them that doesn't require cooking. Good options are: tomatoes, bell peppers, olives, sesame seeds, olive oil, garlic, feta, nuts, cucumber, salt, pepper, mediterranean spices. If you want to iimpress someone (or yourself) use the combination feta + roasted sunflower seeds.  Japanese something  This one may sound weird and some people don't like nori (seaweed you can buy in sheets in japanese stores), it's very healthy though.   Cook rice Rip nori into strips and throw them in a pan Add chickpeas when the nori is crispy   Pasta pesto Italian style   Boil pasta Add a jar of pesto   For people who like to have standard three component dishes   Wash and cook potatoes (in the peel of course) Cut broccoli in big pieces and cook it as well Bake a vegetarian burger or some alternative, if you use tofu be sure to add spices, and mostly lots of soy sauce If you're relaxed enough everything is finished at the same time   This is one for when you have guests. It doesn't really fit your request but it's not hard to make, you can impress people with it and it's delicious.   Cook rice Cut and wok onions and carrots and add green beans (they take a while, if you want to play safe you can cok them seperately and add them in the end) Add bell peppers. Alternatively: add vegetables from a previous dish. This is important: Add tomatoes (no tomato sauce), soy bean sprouts  (usually quite cheap), coconut milk, thai chili paste!, optional: a can of corn Cut up a fresh coriander plant (at least here, they sell them in supermarkets). use it to top of your dish"

We should not castigate them for their choice to eat meat, we should not put them in the lime light, and in my book the same goes for vegetarians, why should this little girl be held up, in the most loving way, as an adorable freak?  She is just a person exercising her choice, do all parents take their kids to nutritionists to check they have a healthy diet?  No.  I think this is part of the problem.

Now I do most of the cooking for everyone, and no one ever complains about the lack of meat at my place.  Small edit: Thanksgiving dinner was never an issue in my over 20 years as a vegetarian, either.  I don't know anyone that uses any kind of broth in their mashed potatoes, makes yams with marshmallows on them, or puts animal fat on veggies.  Are these all really that common of a practice?"
Vegetarianism,1qxvoy,padlockx,3,Tue Nov 19 15:15:37 2013 UTC,"In my twelve years as a vegetarian, I thanksgiving is decidedly the worst holiday of the year. My grandparents hire cooks from backwoods Virginia who think I am a weirdo. Animal fat goes into everything, and I have to ask for special treatment every year. My grandfather does not enjoy potatoes, so they are not served. Last year I petitioned them to use veggie stock in the stuffing, to which they happily obliged. They then stuffed it into the turkey, thereby defeating the purpose entirely. Bacon appears on the green beans, and marshmallows on the yams. I  eat lots of bread rolls and granola bars when the meal is over.  My biggest problem is kinda unique. Everyone at my thanksgiving seems to really enjoy paying people to wait on them. I personally kinda hate this, and much prefer to make my own food.   Thinking about it now makes me wish it was over already."

Vegetarianism,1qcgfb,RickyAcid,6,Mon Nov 11 02:11:22 2013 UTC,"I understand the reasoning behind this - as long as we refer to these products as meat substitutes (or similar terms) we are implicitly acknowledging that meat is the default or normal thing to eat and everything else is trying to be meat.   However, to be honest the only reason we are eating these products is that they are analogous to meat and serve the function of meat in our meals in terms of taste and to some extent protein content. I do like easing terms like veggie meat, veggie burger, veggie ribs etc to describe products of this nature and I don't like using terms like herbivorous protein.  The only exception are products that are different enough from their meat analogues that they warrant their own category. For example, quorn. To me it does not taste or feel like meat and it does not really pretend to be artificial meat. In those cases I think that a new term could be used but it is better to use Quorn's approach and develop a completely new name rather than use terms like ""herbivorous protein"" - Just don't call it Soylent."

Vegetarianism,1qcgfb,shinnen,1 point,Mon Nov 11 08:43:12 2013 UTC,"I totally agree with your last point. Only thing is: many people are further discouraged to try something when you tell them it's quorn, tofu, or soy because they think that they don't like it when they've never tried it. If I tell them it's ""fake meat,"" they just come to the conclusion that it has quorn, tofu, or soy in it and therefor don't like it."
Vegetarianism,1qcgfb,bunker_man,1 point,Mon Nov 11 18:35:36 2013 UTC,"Well... yes and no. Calling it fake meat is so off-putting, what do you say to someone who says, ""why do I want fake meat, when I can eat real meat?""  By just calling it what it is, you aren't forcing someone to make the assumption that what they're eating should be meat, but isn't. They're just eating something different.   Food that tastes good is food that tastes good, regardless of whether it's meat or not. If someone doesn't like quorn or tofu or tvp then that's their choice, doesn't mean they can't be a vegetarian, right?  If you must differentiate, just call it a meat replacement, or a meat substitute, which is essentially what it's doing in a (traditional) meal, anyway. But I still don't like it, it's creating a divide between those who eat meat and those who don't, there's no reason why meat eaters can't eat (and like) a vegetarian dish. It's not us versus them, it's about getting people to consume less (if any) meat."

You won't miss the turkey at all. There are lots of fantastic vegetarian main dish options for the holidays, but if you're sitting at a table with folks eating meat and you're concerned about cravings - I personally think fake meat is the way to go, at least for the first holiday.

Vegetarianism,1q56wm,funchy,16,Fri Nov 8 14:33:08 2013 UTC,"Here in Japan, tofu is much more common in everyone's diets, so the price is lower.   It is actually a common trope in tv dramas and movies that when people are really poor, they'll use only tofu in their food, because they can't afford meat. I've never bothered to look at the price of meat, but a block of tofu is about 90-150 yen (depending on the type of tofu and where you're buying).   (Bonus point, lentils and beans are conversely quite expensive here, whereas in the west they're generally a cheap protein option.)   Also, to touch on your point, meat receives subsidies which could result in the price being lower than tofu, but maybe someone more knowledgeable than me could talk on that."
Vegetarianism,1q56wm,masonmason22,8,Fri Nov 8 01:56:00 2013 UTC,Can I ask about being a vegetarian in Japan? I had a job opportunity there a while back and they really stressed that being a vegetarian in Japan is next to impossible.
Vegetarianism,1q56wm,motherflutter,14,Fri Nov 8 05:03:20 2013 UTC,"That's a whole bag of worms that question is.   Basically, no, it isn't impossible. But it is very hard.   The biggest point would be ""dashi"" which is a broth made from katsuo (a type of fish).  Dashi is the base for almost every dish in Japan (even tamagoyaki, a type of fried eggs).   Personally, I have come to allow it when eating out (but still avoid it where possible). I am very rural and need to strike a balance between showing people that vegetarianism and veganism is a thing, but not being a colossal pain the ass.   Cooking at home it is easy to be 100% vegan, I just use kombu dashi (kombu is a type of seaweed) and use Japanese veges and tofu mostly. Although recently I've been ordering lentils and beans online.   Eating out, your options become limited, I'm lucky because I'm a regular at a couple of restaurants and they will make me a vegetarian version of basically anything on the menu.   Conbini will usually have some onigiri that have no eggs or fish in them that you can eat, you can then top up on protein with nuts. If you don't mind eggs, there are usually egg sandwiches and other various breads  Culturally, it is frustrating. The approach to animals and food is a bit different to the west. I don't wanna put everyone in a box with a generalisation, but so far my experience has been that most Japanese people don't have any sense of empathy regarding animals used for food.   A good example of this cultural difference, at an aquarium, people were saying ""Oishiisou"" (Looks delicious!) about the fish swimming around.  Or when a Japanese girl and I saw some pigs being raised in a tiny concrete and iron pen and she couldn't fathom why I felt bad for them.   Sometimes I do feel alienated due to not eating meat. Often my co-workers will all go out to yakiniku (think korean bbq) together and I'll have to sit it out. Not just that, but getting a separate meal at work dinners further singles me out as ""different"", which can be alienating.   TL:DR If you can forgive dashi, it is hard but not impossible. If you can't allow dashi, it would be very very hard."

While we do still buy it during busier times, it's always a bit disappointing unless it's homemade now. On the bright side, aside from being around the kitchen, you don't have to be cooking the whole time, so as long as you remember to stir every once in a while and monitor for signs of boiling over during the simmering process, you aren't actually working the whole time, so you can read or play a video game or do something else you're able to do in viewing range of the stove for most of the time. We use a spring loaded press, so you just dump the stuff in after draining it, put the top on, and come back in a little while rather than having to manually tighten the top or manually press it without a press. Honestly the most time consuming portion is probably washing the dishes/pots/food processor."
Vegetarianism,1q56wm,CritFailingLife,3,Fri Nov 8 23:41:49 2013 UTC,"I'm pretty sure that the soy is fermented for tofu, so it does take some time.

Cheap hamburger (probably the least expensive fresh meat) is maybe $8/kg - or $2.80 for 350 grams.  Any other cut or type of meat is certainly more expensive.  Conversely, I lived in Australia for a few years and tofu was very expensive there (maybe $6 or $8 for the same 350 gram block) and chicken wings were as cheap as $3 or $4 per kg.  Probably has a lot to do with how popular it is regionally."

I know that's a trite question, but bear with me. So, in my own world view, the thing that bothers me about farming is the idea of raising an animal solely to become food. Whereas, say, a lion might hunt an antelope, the antelope was not bred for the sole reason of being dinner for the lion. Humans are not obligate omnivores, and as others have mentioned, the amount of meat we eat is extremely inefficient (there's a good argument, for example, that the practice of raising sheep in medieval Britain was responsible for a rather large number of deaths due to famine because otherwise good farmland was being wasted as grazing land) and as such unethical if not for that reason alone.   When you say that an animal should never have to become meat, does that mean that it is unethical to allow an obligate carnivore to kill prey? An obvious example here is cats, which have to have omnivorous diets to be healthy (however that's a whole other can of worms as cats have been introduced into a lot of places where they shouldn't have been which has caused a lot of harm), but take for example, lions. Lions need meat to live, i.e. they will lack essential nutrients on plant based diets and suffer until eventually dying. Is it unethical to allow lions to hunt other animals?   Again, I'm not trying to attack your views at all, I'm just curious what your thoughts are. Thanks!"
Vegetarianism,1pn73x,Wonderbite,6,Thu Oct 31 23:57:29 2013 UTC,"That's a good question. Obviously one's own survival comes first. Obligate carnivores, wild animals, and some ""primitive"" peoples do have to eat meat to live, which is just part of the natural order. But us modern humans (and some of our domesticated animals; there's vegan dog food out there that's perfectly healthy) have a choice. We can be absolutely fine on a totally vegan diet that doesn't directly cause anyone harm or distress. So if we choose to eat meat and other animal products, it's not for survival, it's solely for a desire to have that particular taste in our mouths. We don't have to eat meat at all. We're inflicting suffering and death on sentient beings for no other reason than personal preference. That is one of the most immoral things I can think of."
Vegetarianism,1pn73x,cephaloman,3,Fri Nov 1 00:33:33 2013 UTC,"Yeah this is the crux for me. I have survived perfectly well without meat in my diet for a couple of years and maintained at least the same quality of life (if not better), and I am a fairly active person.  This leads me to believe that meat industry is an unnecessary waste of resources and animal lives. I sure as fuck wouldn't want to be farmed by some species that didn't NEED my nutrients but loved how my ass tasted in a bun with cheese."
Vegetarianism,1pn73x,cephaloman,3,Fri Nov 1 12:14:19 2013 UTC,Gotcha. That's basically entirely in line with my own views on the subject. Thanks for your articulate response!
Vegetarianism,1pn73x,Papaste,0,Fri Nov 1 01:41:34 2013 UTC,"It is really ill-advisable to feed your dog vegan dog food. Vegan dog food exists but is not perfectly healthy. Dogs are a subspecies of wolves. They have evolved to be carnivores. Your dog will probably not die from this diet, but it will be unhealthy. Just as you wouldn't want to feed your dog really crappy, cheap dog food, you wouldn't want to put them on a vegan diet. Sure they'll get the same amount of nutrients, but as I said earlier, their stomachs evolved to absorb those nutrients from meat(a reason why cheap dog foods  suck: low meat content). If you truly care for ""moral"" treatment of animals, then you wouldn't put a dog on a vegan diet. Humans on the other hand... yeah we don't need meat."
Vegetarianism,1pn73x,paiaw,10,Sun Nov 3 11:47:25 2013 UTC,The volume of meat in the modern diet is unethical.  The environmental impacts of meat production at the volumes required by a modern diet are unethical.  The mental distance people keep between the meat and animal is unethical.  Labor conditions at slaughterhouses are unethical.  Living conditions of meat animals are unethical.  Eating meat is not intrinsically unethical but is attached to at least some amount of suffering.  As intelligent human beings we should be able to limit the amount of suffering caused by our need to eat and do it in an ethical way.
Vegetarianism,1pn73x,paiaw,3,Thu Oct 31 22:26:15 2013 UTC,"Eating meat is not intrinsically unethical. But is it ethical to end the life of another when it is not necessary for one's own survival? I sometimes hear people argue that meat is ""okay"" if it's wild game that's been properly hunted because there was no suffering. Does a lack of suffering make killing animals okay?"
Vegetarianism,1pn73x,D_SAC,2,Fri Nov 1 00:00:52 2013 UTC,"Without arguing hypotheticals, I am not completely entrenched on a position concerning the death of an animal for consumption.  I do know that hunters are far more in touch with their food than value-meat grocery shoppers but I also know that hunting is not a sustainable resource for large groups of people, neither is foraging for wild vegetables.  I believe it is possible for hunters to act more ethically than grocery store carnivores but that doesn't mean that hunting is necessarily ethical.  We value some life more than others all the time, I am not sure it is possible not to.    I'm just happy when people make conscious decisions on improving their food.   We don't need everyone to go vegan to have a massive impact - we just need to help people make better choices.  If only eating hunted food is someones choice, I know they are on a journey of food awareness.  I'm not about to slam them back to square one."
Vegetarianism,1pn73x,WitheredTree,3,Fri Nov 1 16:01:50 2013 UTC,"This is very similar to my own world view. Environmentally, the over production of meat is a disaster. But perhaps even more salient, I think it is a problem when you consider the fact that we could easily produce mass surpluses of food if we replaced meat farming with food crops. In terms of the net transfer of energy, meat is ridiculously inefficient, and totally unnecessary."
Vegetarianism,1pn73x,billybigboobs,5,Fri Nov 1 00:06:02 2013 UTC,"Choice.  I'm glad I live in a place where I have a choice what to put in my stomach everyday.  Even living in Sweden, where the meat production is relatively... okay, I would never go back to eating meat, when I feel like I have a choice. I honestly don't know enough about the meat industry to have that as my sole reason. Usually when people ask me I just answer thruthfully ""becuase it's fucking awesome!"". Cooking has become so much fun and I've learned so much in the last year trying out new stuff in the kitchen. It's cheaper and leaves you full and feeling really good (not that bloated and nasseus feeling after a fastfood meal). I was doing fieldwork in northeastern Siberia this summer. There was no way to make that work and I ate meat and fish for a few weeks. There are no factory farms there, no environmental impact of the meat on my plate. It still didn't feel right and it was great to be back home where I felt fortunate over my choices as to what I can eat. I've persuaded several people I know to remove meat from their plate without mentioning any ethical reasons at all :)"

Vegetarianism,1pn73x,juicyjubilee,4,Fri Nov 1 00:10:12 2013 UTC,"Honestly, the rest is details. You reduced meat intake a bit? Good! Cut it out entirely? Better! Stopped eating anything that uses anything non-plant? Better still! You get the idea.   I think people treat it too black-or-white sometimes. If I slip and accidentally eat something with meat in it, well, it happens. I just avoid it the next time. If someone decides that they want to reduce meat intake but ""cheat"" and have a steak now and then, well, that's not as nice as if they really did give up meat entirely, but it's still a massive improvement, so good for them, that's progress."

They looked forward to bath and trim time, and yet I still run into vegans that insist that we were torturing out little guys.  Now, we provided the Santa Barbara area with high quality, humane dog wool. We kept our animals happy. We fed them a delicious vegetarian diet high in protein and love, and anyone that wanted to tour our facility was always welcome.  But of course, it's easier (and lazier) to assume that all animal subjugation is torturous.  tl;dr - Veganism is lazy. Search out ethical dairy, wool, and honey farmers locally.

That said, I don't have an easy solution for what we would do in a post-commoditization world, but it's definitely an uncomfortable system that we have going on now.

Now, I know that dog breeders are sometimes frowned upon as a whole, as unnecessary animal production adds to the already burgeoning dog population, but our guys were added to this rescue population after retirement. Many of them stayed on the farm as family pets, while others moved on to new homes. Adoptees also came with one skein of their own yarn, which people got a kick out of.

While tiny, often dirty cages may not be what consumers envision when they crack their morning egg, they are also not envisioning scientists in white coats engineering their condiments. “Hampton Creek” may sound farmy, but in reality the product is created in a lab far from any field.   I wouldn't give a shit if they called themselves Soylent Labs, I really have no problem with this. I wish people weren't so pro-organic/anti-GMO. (and so obsessed with authenticity)  We can solve a lot of problems with science and I for one would be ecstatic about fake meat, eggs, and milk.  I'd have zero reservations about eating test tube meat.   It's like when Taco Bell was being criticized when it came to light that their beef filling was ~30% beef with the rest being mostly soy and oats.  People were shocked at the apparent lack of meat, but my only complaint was that they didn't just make the filling entirely vegetarian. They were mostly there, what a wasted opportunity!

Vegetarianism,1p77xx,YouCantFakeThis,6,Fri Oct 25 22:04:15 2013 UTC,"GMOs are gonna save the world, bro.   How exactly?  Hunger is a distribution problem, not an abundance problem, so increasing crop yields via experimental products like GMOs doesn't even address the serious ""save the world"" type issues surrounding food production."
Vegetarianism,1p77xx,Buffalo__Buffalo,3,Fri Oct 25 22:51:15 2013 UTC,"We have a winner!   When current food production is enough to sustain an estimated 10 billion people, but people are still starving and suffering malnutrition en masses then it's clearly not an issue of production.  And that's without even considering the impacts of how many extra billion people we could feed without having to feed livestock for slaughter.  It's a matter of distribution - and thus a matter of politics."
Vegetarianism,1p77xx,stevez28,2,Sat Oct 26 05:16:42 2013 UTC,"How exactly?   Well the distribution problem basically has three facets: poverty, price, and transportation.   How can GMO help with poverty? As long as it's a proprietary product of an agricorp, not very much. But that's a problem with the business model, not a problem with GMO itself. With a copyleft approach, (public domain, open source, etc) GMO could be accessible to poor communities. GMO increases yield per acre which has huge ramifications for rural communities, particularly those that rely on subsistence farming. Even those that cannot grow enough will have to purchase less of their food, and those with a surplus will be able to sell it as a source of income. (Likely to local urban centers, so this has ramifications for city dwellers as well)  Crop surplus is the cornerstone of civilization, so we cannot simply ignore the increased yields from GMO. Cotton built the south; crops can determine the fate of a people.  How can GMO help with price? Well this one's fairly obvious, higher yield reduces price as a result of supply and demand. Costs of production are reduced because less fertilizer and pesticides are required. Because more food can be grown locally, (as the crops can be tailored to different climates and environments, soil, etc) transportation costs are also reduced.  How can GMO help with transportation? Like I said, higher yields can be achieved locally. Also, many areas that have typically not been fertile enough to produce crops could do so with the right plant genetics. As a result, there would be fewer communities that rely on importing all of their food. Also the diversity of food that can be grown locally is increased. Crops that have normally been constrained to a limited geographic area (like tropical fruits) will be able to grow in many more locations and this decreases shipping distance.  It's not just a quantity problem, it's a quality problem. Healthy food does a better job sustaining people. Many people do not have access to quality foods and as a result, suffer all sorts of deficiencies that lead to long term health problems. By increasing the nutritional value of food, not just caloric content, GMO could improve the health of billions of people. This is even true in America where many people get more than enough food, but not enough healthy food.  I think it's also worth talking about sustainability. With GMO we could decrease our reliance on pesticides, fungicides, fertilizer, etc which will improve our air, soil, and groundwater quality. Keep in mind that we can also use less land and water with GMO crops. Many rivers in America have dried up in the last century and right now the Colorado River is critically endangered. The main culprit is irrigation/agriculture so GMO is one of the steps we can take to preserve it. We could also regulate which crops can be grown where and move the thirstier crops to wetter areas or limit their production entirely. GMO happens to give us more flexibility in this regard as we can better adapt crops to move to different regions. (Of course limiting population growth would help, but if you think GMO pisses people off, don't even think about bringing up population control!)   Better land use could slow deforestation going forward, which is important in and of itself but especially for climate change. Speaking of climate change, I worry that crops may not evolve quickly enough on their own to keep up with it. We could see crops get fucked by droughts, diseases, insects they didn't evolve defenses to, (animal life will of course move away from the equator more quickly than plants) more weeds, etc. By playing a more active role in plant evolution we could hopefully mitigate some of these problems.  TL;DR: While it probably is a bit overoptimistic to say ""GMOs will save the world"", I certainly wouldn't be so quick to dismiss their potential. You are both oversimplifying."

I will ALWAYS eat (and prefer) a vegetarian meal when having a meal at a corporate function.  When requesting a lunch for a work function, I kindly ask for a vegetarian option (because I won't eat pork, beef, chicken, turkey, lamb, etc).  If asked further about it, I say I'm ""mostly vegetarian"", but that I will eat fish occasionally.  I'm a pragmatic guy (in general).  My diet is a matter of pragmatism.  I want to reduce my personal impact on the world. I want to lead as an example that others can do the same without giving up everything they love.  I know it's not a popular thing to talk about amongst veg folks, but 30 million people eating one less meal with meat a week has a hell of a lot more impact that 100,000 vegans.

For lobsters it's iffy but more info is coming to light that they do. For oysters, it seems like they probably don't. For jellyfish it's doubtful.  But if you really are so worried about a carrot's potential feelings and the possible sufferings of a lettuce, then obviously you would already be eating very low on the potential sentience-scale - only algae and phytoplankton, I'd expect.

First of all, there have been people who have fallen ill due to protein deficiency, and there hasn't been a strong link between heart disease and protein consumption.   Second, any discussion of plant protein should include a discussion of the amino acids that comprise protein. Spinach may  have a fair amount of protein, but it's not a complete protein, so you cannot live healthfully on spinach alone.   Finally, (and this is just a minor thing) when identifying the nutritive content of legumes, grains, and beans, it is important to distinguish whether the portion sizes are of the cooked or dry form of the food. One cup of uncooked lentils has about 50g of protein, but one cup of cooked lentils has about 18g."
Vegetarianism,1onw4z,InfiniteHatred,1 point,Thu Oct 17 20:54:58 2013 UTC,"""Complete protein"" is a misnomer. All plants contain each of the amino acids necessary to sustain human life. The ""completeness"" of a protein source derives from how closely the amino acid profile matches what humans need. Many plants are not ""complete"" sources of protein because some amino acids are out of proportion to others, but they still have all the necessary amino acids. One can obtain sufficient amounts of all the amino acids one needs from a plant source even if it's not ""complete,"" but one must consume large quantities of that source, often in excess of his caloric requirements. For instance, one can meet all his protein requirements by consuming only tubers even though they are not ""complete,"" but he'd have to eat about 10-12 medium potatoes to do it (this doesn't address fat requirements, though). This extends to spinach, as well, but one would turn yellow by the time he gets enough protein from spinach (not that that's harmful). Combinations of foods with complementary amino acid profiles diminish the total amount of food mass one must consume to meet protein requirements. As you said, this article could have gone into more detail and addressed food combinations."

I understand that animals kill animals to eat and I see that as natural and fine. If humans killed animals in a humane way to eat them, and appreciated their life, perhaps I would still eat meat. The fact is, humans have turned animal consumption into a profitable industry, cutting costs wherever possible, which includes cutting the living conditions of the animals involved into horrendous conditions.  The health benefits are an additional motivation but for me, it's not the fact that an animal had to die for me to eat it. It's the life that it is forced to live (constant pain, tiny cages, untreated infections, death everywhere) before it is killed.  *I realize I could eat meat that is organically, free range grown, but I chose not to because it would be too tempting to eat conventional meat at restaurants and because there is a sense of pride with identifying myself as a vegetarian."

Vegetarianism,1ohugs,catjuggler,3,Tue Oct 15 19:57:18 2013 UTC,"This is unfair. There are lots of reasons someone would have difficulty going vegan. I'm broke and fairly healthy, and most vegan meals I do cook take me a while to cook. I'm fairly busy during the day, and I don't have the extra time I need to make a healthy, cheap vegan dish that I enjoy.    I'm doing all I can while I'm still working and going to class, but any more would add so much more stress to my day."

Vegetarianism,1ohugs,kosure,1 point,Tue Oct 15 21:11:34 2013 UTC,"I feel like you're proving the point of the quote. Someone thinking about the animals, what they suffer and the ends they meet, would realise how trivial it is in comparison that you don't get to try out the latest brand of faux cheese from a health store."
Vegetarianism,1ohugs,blargh9001,1 point,Wed Oct 16 08:33:13 2013 UTC,It's possible to care about animals and be upset about a lack of fancy cheese substitute. Being a vegan means not using animal products. It doesn't have anything to do with living up to someone's moralistic standards of constant grief.
Vegetarianism,1ohugs,kosure,1 point,Wed Oct 16 12:01:48 2013 UTC,"That's a perfectly good point. I was talking about people where the 'difficulty' of veganism was a concern to the point of it factoring into the decision of whether to be vegan or not.  If all veg-specific products vanished or if I could never eat out again, I would be very sad about it too. I thoroughly enjoy these things. But it still wouldn't even begin to factor in to my decision of whether to be vegan or not. The issues are in such fundamentally different ballparks."
Vegetarianism,1ohugs,blargh9001,1 point,Wed Oct 16 12:34:03 2013 UTC,I agree they are two different ballparks. My problem with the quote is that it doesn't say anything about your (reasonable) ballpark.
Vegetarianism,1ohugs,kosure,2,Wed Oct 16 12:48:46 2013 UTC,The quote has more to do with perception of ease/difficulty than it does the actual process of switching. I think it is aimed at people who claim they just can't live if they can't eat a steak or some such objection.

It is not your responsibility to make sure people don't use cane sugar and still call themselves vegan. Eating god damn bone-char bleached sugar is not ruining your veganism.

Well, the world sucks and wants us to fail so I better eat a cheeseburger because I'm vegan.  I don't consider myself a real vegan because I'm still dealing with these issues. I would consider it a bald faced lie if someone who ate processed sugars and other foods with bullshit tossed in called themselves a real vegan.  You're such a pretentious twat. So soup mix with ""less than 2% whey milk"" is now vegan too? The world is difficult, man, it's only 2%. No, the word for those people is vegetarian. I may not yet be a vegan but I am a lover of the English language. It's ignorant as shit when people use the wrong word to describe something, such as calling a product with FUCKING ANIMAL PARTS IN IT vegan.  I don't give a shit what you do, say, or eat, but the fact is, Sweet Tarts and Airheads are not vegan foods. You're not gunna go to hell or lose your super powers if you eat them, but for some stupid punkass to write/post an article targeted at vegans and then include items that are blatantly not vegan, that's just retarded.

Eating meat raises our total cholesterol and for some people that can be very dangerous as it coats  our arteries with a white, waxy sticky substance.

Vegetarianism,1nr19u,Yggdrasilia,5,Sat Oct 5 07:10:01 2013 UTC,"Probably because you're equivocating between HDL and LDL cholesterol, one being good, the other bad, and you can eat MORE cholesterol as a vegan.  aaaaand because veganism isn't a ""diet""- it's a philosophy opposing the slavery of animals and resulting lifestyle, of which diet is a small part.  So the answer to your question: you'd ""try"" veganism because you oppose sentient beings being exploited for human use."
Vegetarianism,1nr19u,OrdovicianOperand,1 point,Sat Oct 5 11:14:30 2013 UTC,"Low total cholesterol is not itself bad. The idea that low cholesterol is bad comes from the fact that it can occur as a result of a disease not because there are diseases known  to result from low cholesterol.  What are your cholesterol levels? I'm a vegan, and my last test was 61 mg/dL LDL, 15 mg/dL VLDL,  and 57 mg/dL HDL for a total of 133 mg/dL. This is very low for the U.S. and other Western countries where so called normal, ""desirable"", or ""ideal"" levels still cause cardiovascular disease."

Also Braggs... not in the mac-n-cheese, but certainly in almost everything else.  My fav : add to TVP crumbles/chunks when making taco filling (along with the other usual spices).  Another is to tofu cubes first fried with (very little) sesame oil and rice wine vinegar.  Add Braggs after tofu is good and brown and while heat is high.  It will sort of caramelize.

All that cardio you are doing will start burning muscle if you don't work on your diet.  A healthy, balanced diet is way more important than reducing your diet to as few calories as possible.  Also 6 miles a day of cardio at 14 years old sounds like a lot. Try doing some weight lifting in place of some of that cardio if you want more effective results.

But make sure you're doing it for you, and not for others, or you might get thin but develop really awful psychological issues as a result.  As for your diet: you want to start the day with heavier meals. Breakfast should be your largest meal, not the smallest. Breakfast jump starts your metabolism, fuels your day, and you have all day to burn those calories.  For breakfast, try one of these:    Old fashioned oats (not instant oatmeal) with protein powder (whatever flavor you like) and whatever fruit you want to add. egg white omelet with veggies a high fiber, whole grain cereal with whatever fruit you want to add and protein powder smoothie: frozen fruit, coconut water or soy/almond/regular milk and protein powder. (I personally like the smoothie the best because its delicious and takes 30 seconds, but its important to vary your meals so I rotate breakfasts)   For lunch:   salads are great, try using kale instead of lettuce. Avocadoes are good in kale salad. Chickpeas and black beans are a good way to add protein to a salad, hardboiled eggs (or eggwhites) are also good options. If youre going to eat a lot of salad you must, must, must make sure you've included a source of protein whole wheat wrap with black beans, corn, roasted red pepper hummus, cilantro sandwich with whole wheat bread, seasoned tofu, whatever else you like on your sandwiches.   For dinner:   brown rice, tofu and veggies. The rice should be the smallest portion of that meal (ie lots of veggies) salad, again make sure you have your protein source brown rice and beans veggie tacos (with or without meat substitute)   Snacks:   nuts are a good snack- almonds especially veggies and hummus apples protein shakes   These are just a few ideas, obviously there are way more options out there. But if you aim for 3 smaller meals and  small snacks in between you will lose weight while gaining health  This might be an unpopular opinion here, but you don't need to be a vegetarian to lose weight. Eating a mostly plant based diet with some lean meats is also a good, healthy option. Tuna, salmon, and chicken are good sources of protein you can also add to the meal examples I gave above.  But there are plenty of ways to get enough protein from being a vegetarian too. I'm an athlete and have been a vegetarian for 10 years and I'm doing just great. I just wanted to let you know that vegetarianism isn't the only way.  If you have further questions or want some more tips, feel free to PM me.

Vegetarianism,1n6j83,thatwriterkid,2,Fri Sep 27 14:54:00 2013 UTC,"I would suggest fruit/yogurt/healthy, non-sugary cereal for breakfast instead! Its important to get nutrients at breakfast- pretzels are a bit salty! Still good for a snack though.   And instead of peanuts on their own, I would go for a bag of mixed nuts and raisins, called trail mix usually.  Are you having any protein or carbs with your salad? Even a small amount helps give you energy.   As long as you get your five-a-day you should be ok. You also may find your iron levels drop dramatically- spinach eaten while drinking orange juice is a great way to get iron.   Well done on the lifestyle change! Glad you feel great :-)"

For one week I don't think it is an issue. (but I am NOT a doctor). Track your calories on MyFitnessPal, and plug in your exercise estimates as well. 1 pound is 3500 calories.

I'm vegetarian/vegan because I genuinely believe there is a near irrefutable evidence-based moral and environmental argument for it. I also believe that changing just one person's behaviour (my own) can make a difference in the world.  Sure, you don't have to defend yourself, but for me, to not do so runs counter to the reason I became vegetarian/vegan in the first place.  I've personally successfully convinced several people to adopt vegetarian diets. Of course people aren't always reasonable, but even if they aren't immediately receptive, you've made them aware of the facts and planted the seeds to force them to think about it.  To answer OP, here's two main points with supporting evidence.   For most people, eating meat directly contributes to the immense suffering (1,2,3) of billions of thinking, feeling (4,5) creatures, for the sole reason that they like the way animals taste. This is because - for most people - it is perfectly possible to have a nutritionally sufficient diet without meat or even other animal-derived products (6). The meat industry is one of the most environmentally damaging industries worldwide. Worldwide, rearing of cattle alone produces more CO2-equivalent emissions than all forms of transport (7). Water pollution is also a massive problem (8). The energy-conversion efficiency of animal products is also terrible; it takes over 40 kilograms of grain and over 9100 litres of water to produce 1 kg of beef (9). Other problems include: over-fishing, land usage (10).

This goes along the lines of: saturated fats in meats, fiber, lack of nutrients/minerals in typical diets etc. and the punch line there is always ""I want to be playing tennis when I'm 85 or 90"" (mentioned in a Dr Fuhrman talk) or ""I'll send you a video of an 80 yr old vegan who sky dived for his birthday, did a muscle up, a front lever, and then a session of trampoline tumbling"" (Dr. William Harris).  If they say eating meat/dairy is healthy and necessary that's when you sort of shrug and smile and find a way to move on.  If they nod a bit and are curious my second points go into healthcare costs for individuals and as a society, the environmental reasons for myself, my kids, their kids and all of our grandkids.  A line I like to use ""If you really think about it, it's the only rational and socially responsible way of eating.  We're stuck in this unhealthy paradigm today but if the world wanted to we could cultivate enough healthy food for everyone.""  Great stat for that is that if everyone in the world ate the same way Americans do we would need around five times the landmass of the earth to feed everyone (thank you vegucated and here's a great link I just found - http://www.personal.psu.edu/afr3/blogs/siowfa12/2012/10/if-everyone-lived-liked-americans-how-many-earths-would-we-need.html).  Also remember that for each person who acts like a crazy person there's usually someone else (probably in the same group) who's eager and wants to change but doesn't know how to so it's important to appeal to them subtly as well and always be cool and level headed, never take the bait.  I've left out ethical considerations because as another poster said below, it will only make them feel like you're attacking them personally.  In fact I would go so far as to suggest trying it for a single day and see how they feel, they may disagree with you at the time but it'll stick if you do it enough and somewhere somehow you may be putting someone on a good path.  It also helps to make them think about why they wouldn't be willing to try it for a day and the most stubborn usually just bury themselves in childish arguments at that point (""I love meat!"", ""I'm at the top of the food chain"",...I'm usually cringing at this point)."

But they are soy free.  Quorn does contain egg and wheat, so no good for vegans or gluten-free.    I really like the texture of these cutlets.   If more than one store near you sells Quorn products you may want to compare prices.  The smaller natural food markets near me sell these for $7 for a box of 4 cutlets, while the larger supermarket chain sells them for $4.    I use these for all sorts of chicken recipes, including shredding it to make chik'n salad, or tacos.  I have only tried the cutlets and the roast, and I recommend them both.    If you wanted to avoid meat alternatives you could try using large portabella mushrooms.  An Italian restaurant near me uses portabella mushrooms for a vegetarian alternative for chicken parmesan and it is delicious."

It is impossible to claim that veganism ""lengthens life expectancy"", rather that ""relative telomere length increased from baseline by a median of 0·06 telomere to single-copy gene ratio (T/S)units (IQR—0·05 to 0·11) in the lifestyle intervention group"".   To determine if it ""lengthened life expectancy"", you would have to continue the study until the subjects died.  And even then, it wouldn't show an ""increase in life expectancy"", it would just show that the intervention group lived longer. It was a 5 year, 35 subject study.  Purely epidemiological - sample size too small, length of study not long enough.   Furthermore, the intervention group did not just adopt veganism, but a full and comprehensive lifestyle change: exercise 6 times a week, stress mediation through meditation and yoga and counselling.  Compared to the control group, who underwent no lifestyle change.  Well tickle me purple - encouraging people to reduce stress, improve their mental health, exercise regularly and eat more fruit and veg improves their health?    It is also impossible to claim if it was ""veganism"" that increased telomere length, rather it was the holistic lifestyle change.  What was due to the veganism and what was due to the other lifestyle changes is impossible to determine.  Perhaps the study would be more compelling if there were an additional group who underwent a similar lifestyle intervention, but instead of eating a vegan diet, ate a regular, well-planned and nutritious omnivorous diet.  But even still the results would be purely epidemiological.   Sensationalised article and article title.  I encourage all people interested in the health aspects of a specific diet to read more thoroughly into the actual research."

This dish consists out of minced Tofu, spaghetti saus (without meat obviously), mushrooms, soybeans, baked potatoes, eggs, and leatus.   You first slice up the potatoes in small pieces and cook them until you can poke through them with a fork without having to push it through. You bake the mushrooms and soybeans in a bit of olive oil until they are light brown. When the potatoes are already a bit brown, add spices (pepper, bbq spice, salt, ...) in the pan of the mushrooms, bake the minced tofu but not too long. after a few minutes, add the spaghetti sauce to the tofu, mushrooms and soybeans, and spice to your liking when the sauce is ready, add the sauce over the potatoes on the sauce (on top of the potatoes) cook your eggs. I put a lid over the pan to speed up the proces, but I don't think it's necessary. add some cheese on top. serve on a bed of leatus, and enjoy.   cheers :D  EDIT: spelling, and please don't mind my English if you notice any mistakes.

It seems like if you agree with most of the viewpoint of the author, it would be a challenge to justify stopping just short of your own lifestyle choice (I'm making an assumption that you consume either eggs or dairy). The author seems to be saying that exploiting animals for food is violence. Your position seems to be that if we exploit them for something other than their flesh, then it is nonviolent.   It is a questionable approach to swap humans and the animals they eat freely, but for the purposes of conversation:   If we imprison humans to harvest their flesh, probably everybody agrees this is violent. If we imprison humans to harvest something other than their flesh, and the form this imprisonment took was like what we do to animals, that would be violence.   You may be a vegetarian who manages to consume animal product by avoiding scenarios that most think of when we talk of exploitation, but then you would realize that does not extend to nine out of ten people who choose not to give up dairy and eggs.  As vegetarians or vegans, we tend to be more thoughtful about exploitation issues but we have to operate in a world that mostly doesn't care. So I have become comfortable with the goal being to reduce harm, knowing I won't be able to totally stop it, but never fooling myself by pretending that because I have made the sacrifices I am comfortable with, that I cause no harm."

Obviously there are plenty of meat eaters who have no problem with it at all, and will not dispute you on your lifestyle choice, presuming you do not dispute them on theirs. In many cases I have been involved in however, when it does come up that I am a vegetarian I will get many responses revolving around the central idea of ""Why are you a vegetarian? You know there isn't anything wrong with eating meat?"" The notable part is that I generally agree with people on that (there are reasons that I have quit eating meat, but its not really on a moral basis). The reason they will jump to the morality of it is because they think there is something wrong with it, so they feel the need to defend themselves when they are challenged about their morals (even though in most cases people do not challenge them at all). The reason they cant comprehend the idea of stopping eating meat, is because they do not want to believe that eating meat is wrong in the first place. If they did that they would have to concede that they were acting against their subconscious sense of morality, making them a bad person.  Like I said, you will meat many people who think it is fine or even a good idea to go vegetarian, even though they will eat meat. Its people who make comments like the title of this post that actually think eating meat is wrong and will try and conjure up some sort of flimsy justification for it, which in most cases never holds up. This is more or less an observation and Im not really sure how well it would hold up if it was thoroughly investigated, but as far as I can tell it seems fairly accurate (obviously this idea isnt full proof). At the end of the day it is just better not to get mad at these people because they probably do think you are right for choosing vegetarianism, they just havent realized it yet."
Vegetarianism,1ltxzm,jackbrux,2,Fri Sep 6 08:51:00 2013 UTC,The best response is to explain that evolutionarily there is very little reason for plants to feel pain. They don't have any method of reacting to that pain like animals do (movement).
Vegetarianism,1ltxzm,Scotty_McFlanahanaty,2,Fri Sep 6 14:17:53 2013 UTC,"There's a real irony in that image. Judging the merits of another life-form by the dissimilarity of its physiology to a human is precisely how meat-eaters defend their choice. Pain is a series of electrical and chemical signal to alert the organism as a whole to damage to a part. It triggers defence, immune and repair responses. Do plants exhibit those? Yes. Does a cow with an explosive bolt through its brain-stem exhibit those? No. Do plants have any awareness of being alive? Do cows? We have no idea. Pain is a poor argument in support of a vegetarian diet. The dead feel no pain. Similarity to ourselves is little better. You'd be hard-pressed to find anything more unlike us that an octopus - (and plants) - but they are way smarter than farm animals (and Republicans). Playing devil's advocate, one could argue that the centralized nature of an animal's nervous system makes it easier to kill in a pain-free way. A cow would be a much better choice than, say, an octopus with its 8-way distributed brain. A plant's distributed chemical response system will continue to function all the time it is torn and maimed."

I've just always assumed I don't get enough so I was eating chickpeas and greek yogurt and all this stuff packed with protein every day without noticing that I was really overdoing it. It's so damn easy to get enough of it!
Vegetarianism,1lnnjh,veggiter,1 point,Tue Sep 3 20:26:17 2013 UTC,"It really is.  If you really look at the protein content of what you're eating, you'll notice that even the relatively small amount of protein in broccoli, bread, rice, peas, etc. tend to add up to a significant amount if you eat enough.  Then some beans or tofu make up the bulk.  I always prefer to eat an abundance of protein anyway though."

Vegetarianism,1lleg7,asoldierofpeace,1 point,Tue Sep 3 03:59:03 2013 UTC,"But the fact remains that children's diets for the most part aren't guided by doctors. Even so, the American Academy of Pediatrics says that a vegan diet is fine.   Vegans are made very aware of the nutrients that are harder to get on a vegan diet, and are very aware of how to get those nutrients. If they are sticking with it through pregnancy and childrearing, I doubt it's a fad for them. They will be reminded constantly by friends, family, and doctors to ensure a healthy and proper diet.   On the other hand, we have people eating a 'normal' feeding their children soda before they're a year old, junk food, and very unbalanced diets. And since they were raised that way, none of their friends or family will see anything wrong with it."

Keeping a cow and suckling yourself at its udder is far more humane than indeed many ""vegan"" practices that involve promoting worldwide animal suffering through participating in capitalism and resource consumption.  On top if it you're appealling to ""authority"" here in the form of Devon Aoki, a fashion model and actress.  Elevating authority is poisonous to our social relations and self-determinism.  Fawning over exceptional beauty is harmful to our self-esteem.  ""Veganism"", if its essence is to minimize animal suffering, is not the same thing as avoiding animal products.  Not all animal products are procured with pain, and not all non-animal products come pain-free.  The rule ""No animal products"" is wonderful in that it's simple.

I think though the most common retort/response to your ""So… why don’t I eat meat?

Vegetarianism,1l9p2v,headovmetal,3,Wed Aug 28 16:50:26 2013 UTC,"One of my linguistics professors once remarked that we use mass nouns like ""cattle, steer, swine, etc"" when we are referring to groups of animals that we ""harvest"" in some form or another, whereas we use count nouns ""cats, dogs, parrots,"" for animals that we interact with on some individual level. You can even see a nice contrast with ""boar:"" when it's an individual animal, it's a count noun, ""I saw a boar over there,"" but when you hunt it, it becomes a mass noun, ""I'm going out hunting boar."" (Some people might say ""hunting boars,"" but I think that's just because it's a less relevant distinction that it used to be.) I sort of think that this speaks to a deep-seated semantic mechanism, whereby we dis-individuate the animals that we are killing so that we feel less guilty about it, and I think that's the same type of thing that the food industry is doing here. By using different language, they change the interpretation of the act in people's minds. If they were to call it ""collecting the inchoate young of the chickens so that they might be eaten,"" it would evoke a much different response than ""harvest,"" which of course generally refers to non-sentient things."

I have had a love/hate relationship with vegetarianism for a few years now. I was 'cursed at birth' with an equal love for animals and bacon cheeseburgers. Up until recently, I decided just not to think about where meat comes from and to disassociate the hamburger/lamb chop on my plate from the cow/lamb from which it was taken. I had tried to go vegetarian a few times, but it never lasted.  Then recently, I came across a disgusting news story involving a woman, a kitten and a video camera. I became physically ill from reading a short part of the article, and was very angry at the woman and at her accomplice. I then realized that it is not credible/sane for me to feel it is wrong to do what she did to that poor kitten, and at the same time be extolling the virtues of bacon cheeseburgers and pepperoni pizzas.  I looked at a thread I had made on another forum several months ago (http://www.twoism.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=181933) and noticed that another user had posted that photograph along with the caption, ""Dooonn't eeeaatttt meeeeeeeehhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!

This sort of anti-meat rhetoric is great for whipping up militancy among vegetarians but does it actually help?  I think it just polarizes positions, sure a few people will be affected but not the masses.  Extremist language like this alienates us from the people we need to speak to most, so why are we doing it?  I have to wonder if this is not a tactic being used by the meat industry, to keep vegetarians, separate and sidelined, to keep the masses from cutting down meat the sort of action that would have a huge impact on their business model.  Perhaps it is time we awoke from the manipulation and became more friendly and had a more meat friendly message?"

Sure small-farm pasture raised cows are most likely to be treated more humanely, but then all people look for is a package of meat with a picture of a pasture on it or an ad ""showing"" how the cows are raised and they will happily assume that everything is fine with how the cows were raised for the beef."

It's dissimilar in that it's distinguishable from meat, but just protein none the less.  Many vegetarians come from an ethical standpoint.  You want to avoid as much pain and suffering caused to animals by looking at the source of your food.  If printed/manufactured meat has caused no harm to an animal, then I would think many would not have a problem eating it.  Personally, I wouldn't.

Vegetarianism,1k70sh,Re_Re_Think,11,Tue Aug 13 09:16:55 2013 UTC,"I didn't think I could either, but two things helped me change my diet.  1). Not doing it all at once.  Some people like doing things completely, ""cold turkey"", and while I respect people who can do that, I knew that wasn't something that was going to work for me.  I started by very, very, very slowly reducing my meat consumption (while still actually eating it and enjoying it).  Like, instead of ordering sausage and bacon pizza, I'd order it with just bacon, so I wasn't eating quite as much meat.  Then I'd order pizza with only meat on one half.  Then I cut out the meats I didn't really like and didn't really eat that often anyway (lamb, a bunch of sea foods, etc.).  Then I stopped eating meat on one day of the week completely.  Etc..  In between each little improvement, I'd readjust to the new diet and just kept living life until it felt normal, until the next time it occurred to me ""oh yes, today I feel like doing a little more now, going a little further.""  The change wasn't completely: ""You do this or you're a failure!"", I didn't have strict rules for it, and it wasn't even always a one-way path towards less meat in my diet (there were definitely the occasional day I ate more meat than I had in a couple weeks), but that's exactly why it worked for me.  As long as the overall trend was going in the right direction, it worked.  It became so gradual, and not a thing I even thought about really, it became something I almost didn't notice.  It became second nature, almost unconscious for me to realize when a food would have meat in it, and what a meatless alternative was.  And one day, you just kind of realize: ""Oh, there's no meat in my diet!  I still remember what it tastes like, and I might still enjoy the taste, but I just don't feel like I need it anymore."" I'm now a lacto-vegetarian, and I'm slowly reducing my dairy intake the same way.    2). I've always liked cooking (so this may not apply to you if you don't like cooking), and I discovered I enjoyed transforming my favorite dishes into vegetarian versions, while trying to keep as much of the authentic spirit or bold flavors of the dish as possible."
Vegetarianism,1k70sh,fruitblender,3,Mon Aug 12 15:42:10 2013 UTC,"I second the ""not doing it all at once"". I did it a little differently than /u/Re_Re_Think, I went step by step. Cut out beef and pork, then chicken, then seafood (which was the hardest for me). The great think about cutting all this out is it kind of forces you to seek out new foods to try. I would have never gotten into Thai, Mediterranean or Indian if I didn't do this."
Vegetarianism,1k70sh,twinkling_star,2,Tue Aug 13 01:48:53 2013 UTC,"People can definitely do it in different ways, in different orders, in different amounts, etc.  I think that's a thing which can be sometimes forgotten.

I think the recipe came from Vegetariantimes.com..   Now that I live by myself I don't do as much cooking as I used to, and I'm not so good at it. I also really enjoy falafel, which I would just buy the premixed stuff form the grocery store and put it together myself, adding yogurt dressing, hummus, etc to my liking. As for indian, I'll eat anything. I like to go to indian lunch buffets and eat till I feel like puking, that food is divine.

I guess it depends on how serious you're taking it and how strongly that term may get to you. Just not wanting you to give in to a craving to eat meat, then getting too hard on yourself for cheating and thus generating negative emotions that might lead toward more cheating or even ""giving up"".  Then again, it might work better than being more lenient, which might make it easier to not go all the way or slide back. So I guess to each their own..."

LOVED meat but was starting to feel too bad about it costing animal lives so one day I decided I wasn't going to eat meat for a whole day and I haven't eaten meat since and to my surprise, it's been REALLY easy. I still eat the same meals (and a lot of the same junk food e.g. pizza, burgers etc. unfortunately), just without the meat. I haven't really been eating meat replacements, just discovering new ways to bulk up the same stuff I always ate with vegetables if it needs it (e.g. spaghetti bolognese, nachos). However, I still audibly salivate at the sight of a Big Mac or whatever burger/take-out on TV but I never feel like my vegetarianism is wavering in those moments but again, it helps to know that a burger's a burger and a pizza's a pizza and I can still eat those, it just has different filling/topping. The ONLY things from my old diet that I really miss because I haven't found a satisfying veg alternative are hot dogs, what I believe Americans call corn dogs??, and fried/battered/crumbed fish.

Also, I'm not even remotely overweight, but people have been telling me I look thinner and healthier. ALSO, food never makes me feel bad anymore. Not only in terms of feeling guilty about eating animals and stomach issues, but also in terms of feeling guilty about eating unhealthily (because it either is healthier than what I would've chosen before, or I feel like I deserve/can afford it because all of my homemade meals are so much healthier now), and feeling TOO full."

The first little while will take a bit of will power - but more to actually start learning to cook and shop without meat than to stop eating it. Once you get that figured out, you probably won't miss it after a couple of weeks. I certainly don't. The important thing is to eat lots of NEW food, not just remove the old. Novelty and experimentation will replace will power very quickly. You can spend a month just figuring out what the hell tempeh is :) Another month experimenting with indian food, another learning about Taiwanese Buddhist vegetarian foods... The reality is that meat is kinda boring bland protein when you get to look back on it objectively. Without the vegetables of any kind it's just not that nice. Try a pork chop or a steak grilled without marinade or pepper or spice or marinade or even wood smoke - all that stuff is vegetarian. I'm not saying that meat isn't satisfying, but on balance - since it is also unpleasant for your digestive system (as you will discover) - it's really no better or worse than other sources of protein. For most people it is just habit. Taking the crappy beef burger over the cheaper spicy bean burger seems irrational once you make the change. You won't understand why you'd ever have chosen a greasy charred slab of grated sphincters  over a succulent and delicious vegetarian (and indeed vegan) option. If you don't want to the hassle of learning to cook differently, you can just go for the fake meats. I find them a bit disappointing, personally, but once you get used to them, I've heard people claim they stop remembering any real difference. It is certainly the most convenient option. Pretty quickly you will find that you will begin to feel lighter, healthier, more alert and energetic and happier and won't look back.      The lack of choice in restaurants will probably continue to annoy you indefinitely, however..."

You learn to cook a lot with spices and with different textures. I made some little patties the other day that were mostly squash and zucchini and they tasted kind of like chorizo (flavor not texture) just because of the spices I used. This might not be a popular opinion in here, but if you just can't seem to quit meat all together right away, quit it for the most part. Expand your knowledge about cooking and spices and different types of vegetables. A lot of meat substitutes are pretty good. I'm kind of obsessed with soyrizo. Eventually if you're like me it won't even be about denying yourself what you want anymore because you'll know how to not rely on meat for flavor."

Vegetarianism,1k3ymc,olhmr,-2,Sun Aug 11 02:51:18 2013 UTC,I honestly could care less if people eat animals or not. I dont think it is a big deal if millions of animals are dying to feed people.
Vegetarianism,1k3ymc,Nayr747,4,Sun Aug 11 06:27:22 2013 UTC,"Why? If you accept that animals suffer like people, which seems obvious, how can you ""care less"" about that? Do you not care about suffering in general, or do you only care about it if it's confined to an artificial and arbitrary group of animals called ""homo sapiens""?  What other reason could you have to restrict your diet? Health? Although there are some health benefits, I don't think there are major health improvements in going from a well-planned omnivorous diet to an herbivorous one, at least for most people."
Vegetarianism,1k3ymc,David1337,2,Sun Aug 11 08:11:06 2013 UTC,"I don't think there are major health improvements in going from a well-planned omnivorous diet to an herbivorous one   There are well documented and substantial health benefits from restricting animal-based food intake. See this Wikipedia page for a good summary.  Personally, I would have no qualms with killing an animal as long as the following conditions are met:   It has had a good quality of life. Its death is as quick and painless as possible.   Since these two conditions can not be guaranteed for all forms of animal products, I try to restrict my diet accordingly, effectively pushing me toward a vegetarian/vegan lifestyle (not quite there yet though). That said, I will still eat game and other food that I know have been procured in a manner compliant with the above points.  You can call me coldhearted and downvote me into oblivion; this is simply how I feel. I have not yet heard an argument that has made me change my opinion from this, but if someone wants to try I'd be happy to listen and discuss."
Vegetarianism,1k3ymc,olhmr,1 point,Sun Aug 11 14:08:44 2013 UTC,"While it's certainly better to have lived a good quality of life rather than a bad one, don't you think the animal would prefer to keep living? By killing an animal, you're depriving it of future happiness that it otherwise would have had, and taking an action toward it that likely violates its own volition and self-determination - acts that would be seen as wrong when applied to humans that fit all the same morally-relevant characteristics.   I also think we have a duty to all conscious beings to act in what we genuinely believe to be their best interest when we can do so. And although it's commendable to try to minimize the pain of death, there will still likely be some suffering involved in this action. Since it costs me little to nothing, I would rather take an action that benefits the welfare of others rather than detracts from their potential well-being.  I would like to hear what you think though."

I have eaten vegetarian for one week while at college (which was a little difficult since I didn't have a kitchen), and two weeks while at home. The two weeks at home was super easy and super delicious.   Although I love the taste of meat, the process really bothers me and I've cut my meat intake severely (initially only one meat meal per day, and now attempting only 1-2 meals per week, no fast food meat). I feel better psychologically and physically!   While eating vegetarian for the two periods, I received so much shit.

Vegetarianism,1jlg66,tommytwotats,5,Sat Aug 3 02:36:21 2013 UTC,"The point was that the standard for ""deserving ethical consideration"" has been expanding to incorporate more and more. Read some Peter Singer. This is a big deal for him.  Now, the whole pet thing was ridiculous. I'll give you that. My dogs aren't slaves—that's false equivalency and takes away from the entire point of Singer's argument (which is theoretically what this thing was trying to channel): it's not that animals are humans, or on the same ""level"" as humans, but rather that they are deserving of our ethical consideration due to their similarities to humans."
Vegetarianism,1jlg66,asthepenguinflies,0,Sat Aug 3 05:23:36 2013 UTC,"eh. if you start expanding out ethical considerations we eventually will include ALL life. plants included, why shouldn't they get a say? they are living things too."
Vegetarianism,1jlg66,lifelesslies,1 point,Sun Aug 4 17:51:16 2013 UTC,"That's just a slippery slope argument, and one that completely ignores the actual argument I made.  Unfortunately, for your argument, there are specific standards to consider. The sort of ethical expansion we are talking about is not willy-nilly and Singer and others (including myself) will argue that there are very compelling rational reasons behind every expansion of ethical consideration. The biggest, is of course consciousness. If a thing appears conscious—in that they have some sort of agency and phenomenological experiences—they likely merit some amount of ethical consideration. An auxiliary standard would then have to be the capacity to feel pain (specifically a certain phenomenological experience comparable to our experience of pain—plants releasing chemicals when damaged do not count because there is no apparent phenomenological experience behind that reaction). To be clear, the capacity to feel pain doesn't override the first standard. For example, if you had your nerves blocked and could no longer feel your body, that would not make it ok for someone to kill you or torture you just because you couldn't feel it. On the flipside, if the first standard of consciousness were in question but it was clear that you were in pain, we'd likely need to take a step back and evaluate the situation some more before running rough shod over your natural rights for our own enjoyment.  If you're still worried about your slippery slope after those considerations, your slippery slope argument completely falls apart when you see that it's not that all rights are being extended to non-human animals, just some of them. For example, a chicken in the United States will never be said to have a right to a free public education. The rights that extend are dependent on the animal in question and their capacities. It very well might (and probably should be) illegal to keep any of the great apes in captivity (even if kept well fed and cared for), but dogs, cats etc. due to their different capacities are likely fine to keep ""captive"" as pets provided they are treated well. There is essentially an unwritten ethical contract in domestication that says ""I will care for you if you care for me.""  This is why the last bit of the OPs post was so ridiculous. It's false equivalency because domestication is not the same as slavery. For example, with dairy cows the agreement would go something to the effect of: ""I (the human) will care for you (the cow), ensure you are fed, happy and free to live a cow's life with minimal modifications to your natural inclinations if you will provide me with milk."" Now, I think this agreement is routinely violated by the dairy industry, but that doesn't make the base idea of domestication and ethical contracts invalid. I know you're not saying that, but I feel it should be clear what I mean by ethical considerations being extended to non-human animals, and domestication is a major piece of that.  So ya, it's not about being a living thing, it's about being a conscious, phenomenologically living thing, and there is no danger of a slippery slope when we actually look at it along those lines. You are in no danger of being arrested for abusing your pet rock, or even your garden, but you'd probably be in danger of being arrested for kicking a chicken, or stabbing a cow if I had it my way.  One last thing: do you come here just to be an ass, or are you actually interested in engaging in a discussion? From your comment history I can tell you're not a vegetarian, so I don't really see the point in your showing up here unless you're curious about why we are vegetarians (which is totally cool, and I'm glad to continue talking) or you just get off on acting like a dick. I'm all about people doing what they think is right, and have no problems personally with people who think it's ok to eat meat. Many of my friends are in the ""oh my god, bacon!"" crowd. Some of them have well reasoned arguments in favor of eating meat, others don't. I just disagree with them, and can only ask that they think about what they're doing and not avoid the question because they're afraid of the conclusion they might come to."

Another reason I wouldn't eat a lot of it is because, as /u/st1710 KIND OF said, it sounds really weird.

For me mostly though, I don't think it takes long as a vegetarian to no longer even like meat that much. It tastes OK, but it's greasy, heavy and makes you feel like shit after eating it. Existing fake meats are likely healthier and no more or less pleasant than either dead animal or in-vitro grown muscle - not the same flavour but equivalent. So, what's the point? Textured animal protein or textured vegetable protein... The latter is going to be better for you and the environment, I'd guess."

Vegetarianism,1j87vn,rebaker814,10,Sun Jul 28 20:53:41 2013 UTC,"Eating meat doesn't fit with my religious beliefs, which requires me to try to reduce my negative impact on the environment and all living beings as much as possible.   To eat meat not only requires an animal to die, but also whatever plants or animals it ate to live. Eating plants directly reduces the amount of death I cause. Livestock herds create methane in high concentration. The grains grown to feed these animals and the work if raising and killing them all use fossil fuels that are only indirectly feeding people. Eating plants instead of meat is a small gesture towards a cleaner, friendlier environment. I would never be willing or able to actually slaughter or butcher an animal, so why should I be willing to eat the result of letting someone else do it? I have never understood how society determines which animals are food and which are friends. Why do people eat cows but not horses (in the US)? Why lambs but not leopards? Why pigs but not dogs?   I wish to live in harmony with both myself and the world in which I live. For now, that means not eating animals. If I lived in a small, tribal village where acquiring sufficient plants to live well was beyond reasonable, I would reconsider eating fish or insects, perhaps.   But that isn't the reality in which I live.  It is easy to easy to eat a complete and balanced diet free from animals, and in doing so I reduce the suffering caused by my life, even if just a little."

Vegetarianism,1j87vn,chimericalcricket,3,Mon Jul 29 17:35:27 2013 UTC,"I grew up in poverty, on a farm. I've run a few garbage routes for extra cash in high school. I've tended to sick or injured family members who weren't quite bad enough to require the long trip and untenable expense of a doctor.   But, to answer your question, I think it is important for each of us to know what is done on our behalf. While I am strong enough, and skilled enough, to hunt, kill, and butcher animals, I believe it is wrong to do so without sufficient need — and even then, it wouldn't be good to kill, only justifiable.  I cannot ask/allow someone else to do wrong on my behalf without assuming responsibility for that wrong.   Thus, what I'm suggesting is a need for empathy with those acting as our agents.  Many seek empathy with the animals —and that is important —but I also believe it is necessary to have empathy and understanding for the butcher/hunter, too. If you are morally uncomfortable with the role that individual is taking, then to gain from their actions should be equally uncomfortable.  In my case, I found myself completely paralyzed when just witnessing my father butcher one of our cattle as a teenager, and knowing that I could barely witness the act, let alone take any active part in it, was a significant motivator for change."

Morality and Ethics. Especially pigs are very intelligent animals, as good as or better than dogs and cats. Why do we kill and make them feel pain, just because we want some meat? We are able to not eat it, why do we let them suffer? This is the most knowing point. critism against authority. Many people don't like the idea of the godlike human, which is higher than all the other creatures. They want to live with them together as equal creature. Just because we can.

And so the harshest critics might insult or criticize you on that basis, even if just playfully. Especially teenage boys.  That's why I think the best response I have to these people has been actually to say ""It's ok to kill an animal. It's not ok to torture an animal."" It shuts down their attempt to paint you as weak because everyone agrees torture is wrong.  And it's too time-consuming and impractical to get into a debate about why it's wrong to kill animals so I would just skip around that and simply get traction with them by focusing their attention on the issue of whether industrial meat farming amounts to torture. They're usually ignorant about that issue and so this puts them on the defensive and they don't know what to say to that. Because they assume you're more knowledgeable about that subject, which you are."

I'd imagine if I say that to someone, though, they would respond with the issue of compassionate animal farms - or the interdependency between animals and plants, with biodynamic farming and crop rotation and healthy soil with manure, and things like that. As a vegan, I sometimes find it difficult to express a response to that. I usually tell them that “organic” or “free-range” labels are misleading, but I’m not sure how to explain or what else to say. I don’t know, how would you respond?"
Vegetarianism,1j87vn,danslamaison,2,Fri Aug 2 06:42:27 2013 UTC,"If they brought up points like that and were willing to spend time debating then it would be an interesting discussion. I would pretty much have to rant at them like this until they had enough:  First, most importantly, there's simply no reason to view animals as special and apart from humans in respect to killing. I would say (if I could remember all this off the cuff) that animals are special because they're dumber than humans and don't have language and reasoning ability. That's it. But point out the philosophical theory or esteemed moral principle that says ""stupidity is a good reason why it's ok to kill someone."" No such ethical framework like that exists, no one has ever even tried to justify such a thing.   Also I would definitely try to remember to say how people with graduate-level training in philosophy are vegan at a rate 10X-20X higher than the general population. And out of those philosophers who are not vegetarian half of them report having serious ethical doubts about whether it's right to eat meat.   http://themoralperspective.com/2012/10/10/survey-registers-philosophers-eating-habits/    What if super-intelligent aliens landed and found all these relatively very, very dumb humans milling about? Would someone who eats meat hand the aliens a fork and a plate and say ""don't worry, it's ethically right for you to eat me because of how completely stupid I am compared to you who are a much better, different species."" No way - double-standard anyone? Humans have just arbitrarily drawn a line neatly around themselves based on no reason where you have to be dumber than a human for it to be ok to kill you. Just out of convenience, ancient non-science-supported habit, and selfish interest. I might start eating meat if someone can prove why being dumb and mute is acceptable grounds for being killed. Such a thing could never be called compassionate in any way regardless of how painlessly they are executed. You would never imagine doing that to mentally-disabled humans and calling it 'compassionate killing', it's an absurd contradiction. The whole meat-eating enterprise simply lacks a good reason for existing in the year 2013, period.  I think it's not certain enough that compassionate killing is carried out at those special farms. It's really hard to kill a big, highly evolved animal like a pig. They're not like bugs, you can't just squish them. And they are killed by machines and humans operating them. Machines fail and humans fail. And what happens when the machine fails and the animal is left with extremely horrific injuries? After they are supposed to be killed some machines automatically rip their skin off and their joints are smashed. I've seen evidence that it happens in animal farms even with their highly technological methods. I can't imagine simply trusting that an animal I have ordered to be killed (by paying for it at the counter) has been killed fairly (an oxymoron anyway).  What would you say in your defense to the bloody face of that 1/1 million animal that's been accidentally tortured like that? ""I'm sorry I was...pretty sure some stranger was killing you fairly.""       People misbehave when no one's watching and I think when a person has total control over another person or another living thing abuse happens very predictably at some point. That's the situation at all animal farms- one ordinary, flawed human being is exerting total control over other living things in a predator-prey fatal relationship and I think that relationship is always bound to lead to cruelty at least some of the time and it would be a better world if such types of relationships didn't exist.   Interdependency between animals and plants, yes. But I would say that human animals know about ethics and morals. Humans outlaw tons of things that are good and natural for animals to do. Eating meat should be just one more.   But I would call their bluff on the issue of compassionate animal farms. What animal farm out there has found a way to nicely kill pigs and cows? Even if you found some farm that was cruelty-free, still - I'm sure like 90% of food in grocery stores and restaurants contain animal products that come from ordinary animal farms, not special animal farms. So such a person would still be refusing to eat 99% of ordinary food.  I would ask this person if all the food they eat which contains eggs come from chicken farms that don't have de-beaking and are free-range chickens.   Thanks for making me think about all this again and put it down in writing."

They tell me I need to go hunting (I go to college in the south, lots of kids hunt on the weekends and at home): I tell them politely that I wouldn't want to do that either, and that's what makes me different from an omnivore.

If you give people an expectation and then fail to meet it they will be disappointed and not think much of your product and not buy it again.  With a farmers market, you need to think about your customers, are they regulars, is there an opportunity for repeat business?    You could come up with a witty meaty product name that gets them to buy the product but even though they like it with high expectations of ""just like beef"" they may be disappointed and never buy again.    Or you could sell them the product with a non meaty name, but go with with a great spiel about how it is made by hand, simmered, all that goes in the stock and so on.  They buy the product with no meaty expectations find it to be nothing like anything else, like it and keep buying it. I think for a farmers markets in general you want a lot of sign space for people to read, they are buying the product from the person who made it, the purchase is about provenance, the back story, the ethos (one they can relate to do do an anti meat ethos if you sell to meat eaters), the ingredients, their source, the way it was made, the gentle simmering, the hand, the human intervention, the non factory methods, the variability of the product and so on.  Perhaps you should think about branding the stall rather than the products, you might want to sell other products like tempeh if it works well or do different flavoured seitan.  A big sign with ""Praise Seitan"" (stolen form a t-shirt) could get attention, sub consciously it is misread as ""Praise Satan"" it might get people to your stall but they maybe arriving with a negative attitude, you may be able to turn them around, defuse the sub concious Satanic joke, people have a negative attitude to people telling them not to eat meat and yet we seem to survive.  You could work a good story about how we approach things with negative views because of misconceptions and try and work them round, would probably be the kiss of death in a Conservative area, but somewhere boho and liberal it could work.  What I am saying is that you need to address the market audience, we need more details to do anything that will work really well.   There are some great funny names ""Wai Kika Moo Kau"" is a well known veggie cafe, but the name is ""anti meat"" so not great if your target customers are going to be meat eaters.

In practice I think very few people who eat meat made a conscious decision.  They are just doing what everyone else does and what they have always done.  The other issue is that the article assumes that the purpose of effective communication with a meat eater is to convert them.  Personally I do not want anyone to convert, converting people is a waste of time, it places an artificial us and them barrier between us.  We are all people we are all eating food, the thing I try to communicate with my friends who are meat eaters is that there are directions that can be followed, we can go away from factory made food that contains ""who knows what - horse in our veggie burgers?"" and move to food we prepare ourselves, we can move to eating cheaper but better quality food, organic, free range and so on.  We don't need to explain why, we don't need to ""communicate effectively"" we just need to say it is okay to move in our direction, we love you even if you do things we wouldn't do.  Why?

A few weeks to a couple of months. If you can convince them to replace 1 meal in day with a low dairy veggie meal (veggies and rice/whole-grain-bread is what my ex got her dad onto initially for supper) for dinner  for a month it might change their views on the veggie lifestyle. The key is to be persistent and  take as much leverage as you can get from them in accepting how-ever-much little veggie lifestyle they can adopt.    Good luck and stay strong!

I'm very pro environmentalism but I'm sure that at some point in my life I've purchased items from companies with terrible environmental practices.  This doesn't make me a hypocrite it makes me human.  The important thing is to try to the best of your ability to live your life according to your values, not to abandon them because occasionally you fall short of that ideal for one reason or another.  As far as making it less awkward you might try the family history angle.  You were raised vegetarian and out of respect for your mom/because you thought it was beneficial to your life you want to bring that aspect into your current family.

If you have the fortitude to kill animals, you have the right to eat it, but if, like me, you don't want to kill an animal (for personal reasons, not universally applicable moral reasons), then you shouldn't receive the benefit of eating the meat.

I'm not going to force them to do anything, but I will certainly explain to them my reasons why I am vegetarian (moral / environmental / health).  I figure they're free to choose as soon as they're old enough to have an opinion on the matter, but regardless of their decision, I don't plan on buying or preparing meat. What they choose to do at school or at a friend's house is up to them."

If you view veg*nism as a settled ethical issue, this doesn't make a lot of sense.

Vegetarianism,1gth1o,Kierran,4,Sat Jun 22 18:16:01 2013 UTC,"I certainly agree that minimizing harm to all creatures is the ideal, but everyone has to pick where on the idealistic/pragmatic continuum they fall. Avoiding some meat? All meat? All animal products? Growing all your own food to prevent harm to creatures from threshers and harvesters? Living in a cave eating slime mold?  All of these are closer to the ""ideal"" of minimizing harm, but figuring out how to reconcile that with living in a modern society is not an easy decision. I would rather set my children down the path of working it out for themselves by providing the strong ethical framework in favor of a meatless diet and let them sort out the rest on their own."

You may not be able to rid the world of all the unintentional suffering your existence causes - but you can at least start by eliminating that harm which is intended."

My parents always said if we wanted to try meat, that was fine, and if we told them they would cook it for us. I think they just wanted our first experience of meat to be something good, and as ethical as it could be, rather than McDonald's or something equally repugnant...   Anyway two of my siblings eat meat now, but the other two of us don't. My parents are cool with it. None of us have any kind of health problems (well none that could be related to lack of meat!). My parents taught us all to think about what we're eating, and vegetarian or not, that's a really useful skill!"

Vegetarianism,1gth1o,barrider,8,Fri Jun 21 23:33:55 2013 UTC,"I have no science to back up, just a personal experience. A friend of mine was raised vegetarian, and he turned out just fine (very intelligent, athletic (body-builder type), great musician, handsome, healthy,...).   He had some meat for the first time in his live when he was 15 years old. However, he hated the taste of it and has never eaten meat since then.   Maybe somebody else could provide some scientific facts about this subject?"
Vegetarianism,1gth1o,lolojc,5,Fri Jun 21 21:38:30 2013 UTC,"I was raised as a vegetarian, as were my siblings. My mother discussed it with a doctor while she was pregnant, and bought some books on the matter.   Despite being slightly bullied about it as a kid, both my peers and by a teacher (who told me I couldn't possibly live a healthy lifestyle this way!),  it had no negative effect on me whatsoever.    My parents always said that we could decide for ourselves as we got older, and one sibling does now eat fish occasionally. I tried meat perhaps a couple of times, but as I never had had it, I didn't feel any great reason to. Also, the actual concept of eating something which was once living is generally very strange to me.  In conclusion, make sure they have all the vitamins and minerals they need, and they'll be fine. Once they are older, and eating meals away from you, tell them that they are free to choose their own diet."

Vegetarianism,1gth1o,funchy,14,Fri Jun 21 23:10:19 2013 UTC,"I respectfully disagree.   There are some things that are done in the American culture that i'd never want to pass on to a child, no matter how common it might be among the sub-group he/she wishes to socialize with.  If I lived in an area where dogfighting was going on, there's no way I'd allow my child to take part in any aspect of dogfighting to help him make friends.   If I lived somewhere people did trophy hunting, I don't care how unpopular he would be if he wasn't allowed to join in.       You've got to think that 100 years ago, something as simple as women being treated as independent people & having the right to vote.  Back then would you have raised your kid to treat women as less-than-people because that was a base element of American culture back then?  150 years ago it was slavery.    Just because something was common to American culture in the previous generation doesn't mean we need to pass that along to the next generation.  When he turns 18 and living under his own roof, he can make his own choices.   But in the meantime he's got to be respectful of the belief system he was raised in.   Everyone has a belief system, whether they identify themselves as religious or vegetarian or whatever -- everyone has beliefs.    We should never apologize for raising our kids with our own beliefs, even if it's something not as socially popular at the moment (eg. vegetarianism)"

Prior to the Fall of Man, an Eden prevailed in which people didn't eat the flesh of animals. The Fall brought with it a general coarsening and corruption of the World that extended beyond consumption of meat on the part of humans to include animal predation and natural disasters.   This tempestuous state will persist until mankind is restored to its former piety and innocence.  Until that time, Mankind will persist in eating animal flesh, while recognizing vegetarianism as an available option, redolent of Eden-like holiness."

I don't remember it all, but animals with split hooves and chew the cud are edible. A pig does not chew the cud and should not be eaten. A horse does not have a split hoof and should not be eaten.

They usually have veggie burgers but they tend not to be vegan. One I went to didn't even have a veggie burger. They had something labeled ""mushroom"" burger. It had no indication that it was actually a meat burger, so I thought ""great, something I can eat other than salad"" but when the waiter asked how I'd like it cooked, I clearly realized it was a meat burger....with mushrooms in it....dear god. I ended up getting a lot of mushrooms between two buns.lol  On another note, when you go out with family and such, I feel it best to always bring a snack bar with you, especially if you go on vacations or something.

Like I said, it had no mention of meat, and I thought they'd have something for veggies under the burger menu...but I suppose not for that one.   I feel you are being a bit unfair to me.

I guess it's not far off for you to have that assumption since you  you avoid them altogether.   Hey, I don't choose these steakhouses. I'd love to avoid them. I really only go there with my meat eating family who drags me along. They mostly go somewhere that has more options for me now like Thai or japanese/chinese places where i can get veggie rolls.  They do help you out some. If you ever get stuck at a steakhouse you can ask the chef to make you something special, get a salad, or do as I did and get a lot of mushrooms between 2 buns lol .-. I totally understand how you feel about steakhouses. I was FURIOUS that the mushroom burger wasn't actually a grilled portabello mushroom. Didn't help that all around me were overweight people chowing down on dead animals. I wanted to flip tables, but I just kept it inside and ate my mushrooms and bread lol.

It merely suggests that some girls might be going through a phase where they want garden burgers. It don't even mention because they aren't eating meat. Many people eat garden burgers because they are healthier, and many teenage girls get in a health kick and want to eat garden burgers. It has nothing to do with vegetarians.

Vegetarianism,1gl7h8,dinosaursdarling,1 point,Wed Jun 19 00:16:50 2013 UTC,"I really think you're taking a much more optimistic look at the commercial than it deserves. It seems as if they're taking a stereotype about a very small portion of vegetarians - teenage girls who give it a try, and then give up after a few months because they don't have the self-discipline, or support from their families - and suggesting that that's the only reason someone would order a garden burger. That may just be my projection, but if I'm reading between the lines and finding an insult, that definitely isn't more ""retarded"" (nice choice of language there btw) than you reading between the lines and imagining them saying something about people watching their weight. Where did you even get that? Anyway, if you're just trying to defend a chain of restaurants you like, that's totally fine, but I'm pretty sure the point of discussion here is that they're insulting the group that they're trying to cater to.

Also, in my experience with women, which is probably lacking my some standards, I have met more girls who eat garden burgers to be healthy than because they are meatless.

They also have various versions of ""chicken."" We like the naked cutlets for using in recipes, but they have a raspberry goat cheese one that's also delicious.  They also have chicken bits that are great for soups or other things. We made ""chicken salad"" today for the first time with Quorn, red onion, celery, green apple, red grapes, and walnuts.

He is always picking fights and stressing the others out, and separation is not a great solution so yeah)  I don't think it's wrong to eat meat. I find it wrong to inflict pain or not rear animals properly. Killing is not inherently wrong in my mind."
Vegetarianism,1g9n8o,Kwizi,-2,Thu Jun 13 18:31:02 2013 UTC,"Killing is not inherently wrong in your mind? Would you say the same if that were a human? What if you were the animal who wanted to live out their days and not be dragged to a kill floor? The pain of betrayal, and the experience of demise by someone else's hand when it doesn't need to happen would hurt.   You don't have to explain to me ""range"" or small farms. I grew up on one and sent my own baby cow to slaughter. Only when a friend that I admired got me engaged in animal concerns, did things start to click into place and did I realize how wrong I was. Unlike a whole lot of farmers, I had the courage to step back and question my own actions, and this is where it led me; to the vegan lifestyle.  You already don't eat much meat anyway, so I don't see why you couldn't extend your concern for the animals ""welfare."" into a concern for their very being and ""right"" to be free of exploitation by going vegetarian or vegan."
Vegetarianism,1g9n8o,VeganMinecraft,2,Fri Jun 14 16:24:49 2013 UTC,"Killing is not inherently wrong in your mind?    Other omnivorous animals kill, bear kills salmon, wild boar kill rodents... and so on. Humans are not above animals, but no are they under. Killing for food is not immoral in nature. Why is it immoral for humans to kill?   Would you say the same if that were a human?    Firstly, killing humans really is not absurd. Humans used to be part of the food chain, we fought ourselves out of it. Was it immoral for the tiger to eat humans?   Now I know what you meant though,  would I as a human kill a human (for food I presume). No, I would not. Aside from probably bad taste (joking), humans are conscious of themselves in their own ego, conscious of future, conscious of the impact of their others as well as the impact of their death, able to reason and argue about ethics as we are doing. This consciousness is what would prevent me from farming and killing a human: he would be aware of his status, he would even be able to reason with me why not to kill him. Animals are not aware of the farming (only that they are stuck in this small cage, and that food comes from this tube...), and not capable of reasoning, they are reactive. The react to situations according to what is good for them there and then. So performing something reactive to them is not immoral, because it's part of the rules of their game, so to speak. Us humans play a game with each other that has more rules. (I hope I am clear, it's not so obvious to explain, this I admit).   What if you were the animal who wanted to live out their days and not be dragged to a kill floor?   I totally agree with you on this. I am sure that's what they would prefer. Also that salmon would rather not be killed by that bear. Death is a part of life though, it's a natural process: animals kill and eat other animals.   You don't have to explain to me ""range"" or small farms.   I didn't mean to make it sound that I was explaining range animals. I just meant to explain what meat I didn't ditch (response to your previous comment)    I had the courage to step back and question my own actions, and this is where it led me; to the vegan lifestyle.   Questioning is very good, I also find that we absolutely need to think about what is moral, what isn't and to revise our eating habits to make sure they correspond to our ethics. Not enough people do it (especially in the cities where you never ever see production animals, only prepacked meat in stores). And if you think no animal killing is the way to go, then I am happy you chose the vegan lifestyle. I don't think ""courageous"" would be the appropriate word in my mind though (no offense meant), more ""true to yourself"" as opposed to hypocrites who don't want to know where their meat comes from and could not tend to or kill an animal themselves yet buy factory farmed meat. Caring and realistic would also suit for you.   That last paragraph about exploitation:   It's more symbiosis. We feed, provide shelter, provide veterinary care, provide stress-free environment (no need to look out for predator constantly). Animals live in the present, I believe we can give them a happy life. We end it shorter than it could have been, but they had it happy.   I don't eat much meat for ethical reasons, but my ethics don't point to me that eating meat is inherently wrong. I hope you understand. I could ditch it, but don't feel motivation to. I am morally content with my current life ethics (I might change one day, who knows, maybe you will reply with a compelling argument. But this is a question I have thought A LOT about and I like discussing it if I have time - usually more with meat eaters since I think they are the ones who need more discussion)"

Why on earth would I want anyone to try and rationalize that? I don't care how happy dandy they were before you killed them, that doesn't change the fact that you killed them needlessly.  God forbid, all you have to do is trade in humans for animals and then mass hysteria would break out. This isn't life or death situations here. This is in a proclaimed ""civilized"" society.   It is beyond me how you can't understand that you can't care about animals, then go off eating them saying that you are ""so"" against animal abuse, as if taking their life needlessly isn't abuse. I don't know what on earth, other than your skewed morality, could be holding you back from making the right decision,  but you don't seem to want to change and would rather rationalize continuing to exploit and abuse animals by twisting their death for your palate into something it's not.

If you would want others to treat you with kindness and mercy had you been born a less powerful position, then I suggest you should get to filling up your end of the bargain.

Vegetarianism,1g4vd2,headovmetal,2,Tue Jun 11 17:48:02 2013 UTC,"I disagree.  I find it IS more morally wrong to eat foie gras (force feed painfully, induce a disease, restrict movement) than it is to eat backyard chicken eggs. You are not inducing pain in your chicken, you provide them with food, shelter, protection and in my case, care. For every female I have, indeed, a male was potentially killed. Killing in nature is not morally wrong. The omnivorous bear kills his salmon, the wild boar can kill a rat. Torturing an animal (restricting movement, inducing pain, just generally restraining an animal without providing adequate conditions of life) and doing so consciously, now that is not justifiable. That's just my opinion though.  I also would say there are two variables. The level of exploitation and the purpose of it. Purpose: Exploitation for entertainment is worse than exploitation for nutrition (i.e. bullfighting worse than feeding your family beef because you think you need it in your diet). Level: My hardcore vegan friends were debating and arguing about if horseback riding is vegan/acceptable or not. Whatever side you're on, you can agree that horseback riding is a mild form of exploitation (provided you treat the horse with care) compared the bull-fighting of my previous example.  Putting them together is detrimental indeed to the global cause. It is better to focus on the worst (people will rally more easily against bull-fighting and foie gras), get that banned, and move progressively on further issues. Remember, to make changes, you need the opinion of the population. By lumping everything together I feel nothing will be accomplished."

To see someone success is to see an area you 'could' be succeeding in, but are not.  This includes values that people don't think they have- like treating animals with respect.  Showing that it is possible to live without meat makes a lot of people uncomfortable, and when people feel uncomfortable they get angry.

If you post PETA stuff on FB you now know it's likely going to lead to a big argument with people who don't get it so take that into consideration before you post. I'm not saying you should stay silent all the time but sometimes it's easier to just not post rather than argue with somebody for 2 hours.   Also, make sure you do your research so that you're prepared to answer peoples questions and reply to points they make when they are attacking you. Google is your friend here, vegetarians get told the same stuff over and over so it's more than likely that someone else has already thought of a response to whatever people are saying to you.   And finally try to find more veggie friends who get it, it's a lot easier to hang out with people who understand where you're coming from. :)"

I'm going to check this thing out through this comment as soon as my shoes finish falling apart.  Would you happen to know if they [or anyone] has vegan shoes in weird sizes for similarly comparable prices?"
Vegetarianism,1fdg6e,Lz_erk,1 point,Fri May 31 11:04:56 2013 UTC,"I realize there is a market for this kind of stuff, but at first glance this site seems to have a very limited selection of goods, which are mostly pretty expensive.  It seems like a specialty store.  By asserting a comparison to Amazon, you risk confusing and/or alienating potential customers.     I realize that vegan products tend to cost more than their non-vegan counterparts, but I suggest that you try to incorporate some less expensive options in your store.    There is also some information that should be on every product page for food items, but wasn't there.  For example, I looked at the ""Cashew Date Powersquares"" but I could not see the weight of the contents (grams or ounces) to get a sense of how much food is in each package.  Is a package of those more like a small snack for one person, or enough to share with a few friends?  I cannot tell from the image or description on the site.  Also, some redditors probably won't like the self-promotion here, which tastes like vegan spam.  I appreciate that you didn't try to hide that, since your user name is the same as the site.  But I think it might be received better if you spent some time first by asking questions in this subreddit (for example: ""what kinds of vegan products do you want to buy but can't find at your local stores"") that could help improve the site, and then showing us the finished product."

Much appreciate the invitation to get suggestions since we want to build it WITH the community by identifying gaps and filling them together.  The comparison to Amazon comes in the way that aspiring vegpreneurs can actually create a store on forAnima.com for free and forAnima.com hosts these stores.  The idea is to bring all the vegan options under one roof.  Re: silk flowers - none are real silk.  Re: feathers - there was one feather and we asked the vendor to remove same.  As far as more descriptions of items - we're working hard on that.  Have only been live for 2 months and have already had 250 vendors open a store on forAnima.com and now we're working with them to provide all the information we all need.  Would love to bounce some questions among the group.  It's really a tool for encourage vegpreneurism as much as it is a place for voting with our dollars for change. So, all feedback from our community is useful."

Vegetarianism,1f790f,xoceanblue08,3,Tue May 28 23:16:36 2013 UTC,"This is good advice!   I go no carbs after 6pm.  Lately, i'll eat half a 1lb package of tofu for dinner.  Prep it however you want.  Almonds, cashews, fruits and other nuts are great for snacks throughout the day.  Load up on bread during whichever meal is right before you exert yourself the most.  Most likely breakfast.  Soups, tofu, tempeh, salads, quinoa, or cheese and eggs if they're for you, are great options for no/low carb meals.    Vegetariantimes.com has a section for fast recipes and another for recipes using less than five ingredients.  Making a big ass pot of lentil and bean chili for several days worth of lunch or dinner makes life easier...also tastier and healthier."

Vegetarianism,1f6gmu,wakalixes,2,Tue May 28 04:33:46 2013 UTC,"Is it true that plant protein is inherently inferior to animal protein?   Depends what you mean by inferior. Plant protein is less bioavailable so you would get 95g of protein from 100g of animal protein but ~70-90g of protein from 100g of plant protein. So yeah not really busted.   Should I be worried about B12 deficiency?   Except vegans have a much higher rate of B12 deficiency than the general population. Should you be worried about it? Not really, but you should plan and make sure you get enough instead of brushing it off like this article."
Vegetarianism,1f6gmu,Insamity,1 point,Tue May 28 04:00:56 2013 UTC,"Surely this is contradictory advice:  'obtain the recommended levels of B12 via foods that are fortified with B12 (non-dairy milks, soyfoods) or via B12 supplements.'  'choose organic soyfoods to ensure that the soy you consume is not genetically modified'  If you choose organic soy foods, they won't have B12 added to them. As far as I know, all food fortified with B12 gets the B12 from GMOs.   (Please note this is not me telling people to not eat fortified foods - as a biochemist with an in depth understanding of how GM works, I am 100% pro-GM)."
Vegetarianism,1f6gmu,Spider_Pie,2,Tue May 28 16:39:14 2013 UTC,I don't think organic and B12 fortified are mutually exclusive. Here is an example: http://www.nasoya.com/products/tofu/tofu-plus-extra-firm.html
Vegetarianism,1f6gmu,satyagrahaha,2,Tue May 28 18:15:24 2013 UTC,"I can't find any information on this particular brand, but what I've found before with this kind of product is that they will use genetically modified organisms to produce B12, then feed that B12 to yeast/soy/etc - this means the yeast/soy/etc is fortified, but is not itself a GMO, so they can say 'this product contains no GMOs'. This may not be the case here though, I'd be interested to know where they do get the B12 from in that case. I'll email them about it and report back if I get a reply."
Vegetarianism,1f6gmu,Spider_Pie,1 point,Tue May 28 19:28:57 2013 UTC,"I just tried to reading a bunch about b12 production for fortifying foods and supplements. Everything I have seen describes growing one of a handful of approved bacteria that produce b12 in a growth medium. I can't think how to prove that the fortifying b12 production couldn't use a GMO, but I haven't seen any mention of it yet. It doesn't seem like the bacteria or medium would be GMO. Do you know of any example where that is the case?"
Vegetarianism,1f6gmu,satyagrahaha,2,Wed May 29 04:30:47 2013 UTC,"I had a look myself and it looks like some companies use bacteria that naturally produce B12, and some use GMOs. The main difference is that GMOs produce B12 in higher quantities (so cheaper), produce less contaminants (so it takes less effort to purify) and can be less dangerous organisms than the natural producers of B12. So you were right, they can use unmodified bacteria :)   Although as a public service announcement I'd like to note that if you buy the organic version of Alpro soy milk, it does not contain any fortification, so be careful if you always drink that and assumed it was fortified!  Sources:  'Genetic engineering techniques has allowed us to change the byproduct status of this vitamin towards principle product. The strains of Streptomyces griseus have been developed via rigorous strain improvement programmes involving mutations and recombination techniques to yield more vitamin B12. Genetic approaches like genome shuffling have also been applied in Propionibacterium shermanii to improve yields of vitamin B12.'  'The species Pseudomonas denitrificans and Propionibacterium shermanii are commonly used today. At least one company, Rhône-Poulenc of France, which has merged into Sanofi-Aventis, used genetically engineered versions of one or both of these species. Since a number of species of Propionibacterium produce no exotoxins or endotoxins and are generally regarded as safe (have been granted GRAS status) by the Food and Drug Administration of the United States, they are presently the FDA-preferred bacterial fermentation organisms for vitamin B12 production.'"

All you basically need is the gluten, maybe some soy sauce, some veggie brother, maybe some garlic, and you can make your own.
