Python runs outpost trades for fantastic profits or can rake in the cash in CZ's or Res, or even running assassination/kill missions from the bulletin board. Don't focus on the anaconda, focus on A-rating your python, by the time you have done so you can afford a trading anaconda. I sold my a-rated python for that and with the trading capacity of the  anaconda I managed to purchase back my a-rated python in the same state I sold it within exactly 7 days from selling it.

EliteDangerous,3e3jge,Angwar,33,Tue Jul 21 18:03:33 2015 UTC,"In all honesty I think the problem is that the first 10 or so hours of Elite are TOO good. It makes you think that a game where anything (that could happen to you in a space ship) could happen. They set up certain expectations which, as a beta backer, long time enthusiast, and still current fan of the game, I must say, just aren't delivered upon.  So much so that many of the people around here played kinda obsessively. But the later stages of the game don't offer the same depth and dream filled wonder that it does initially, so people are a bit astounded by the anticlimax (Think the Prometheus trailer vs movie).   I think it explains why you get people putting 100+ hours into the game then suddenly deciding they didn't like it. Logically that makes little sense. Even 30+ hours would be decent to good value for your money. But ultimately it's that the game is just not fulfilling its potential like many had hoped.   This is then compounded by the fact that the last and next updates were deviations from what most of us thought was the original production path. Back when we were all dreaming about what Elite goodness was to come nobody saw Power Play or CQC in that path and they've taken a lot of time and resource. This his been disappointing. Meanwhile arguably more basic necessities like tier 2 npc's or more variety of art or content aren't things that are part of the game yet.   There are many more problems. This is a huge game and Frontier's method of implementation (put a basic version of the feature in and fill it out later) has led to a galaxy with a few too many basics.   I'm still hopeful. The way I see it Frontier has until Gamescom to prove to us all that there's still a path that is of interest to those of us here.   I'm not giving excuses for anyone's behaviour. I agree that it just gets too vicious here sometimes (and the FD forums, oh sweet jebuz!). I still enjoy the game to this day. But I hope this helps put things in context."
EliteDangerous,3e3jge,Dax_SharkFinn,7,Tue Jul 21 18:37:11 2015 UTC,Now this is constructive feedback and criticism! You actually gave me some good and new insight and I agree with you on every point!
EliteDangerous,3e3jge,phongbong,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:43:02 2015 UTC,"That, and the sales that Elite has been having.  A lot of people bought it that would never pay full price for it."
EliteDangerous,3e3jge,ComJak,2,Tue Jul 21 19:17:08 2015 UTC,"Well said. The first 10 hours of ED were AMAZING. Learning to fly with a HOTAS was an experience like no other. But that takes only 5-6 hours to get over. Then exploring the world was great. Then I got the ASP and fully outfitted it to A-class. I didn't want a bigger ship. I knew that. Vulture was a boring piece of crap that was just too easy to be fun. Now what?  I came back briefly for PP in hopes of having a purpose in the galaxy, a reason to fly again but that was crushed within days.  I marked 50-60 hours within 2 months or so and still felt bored by the end of it. This is the first game that I have consciously walked away from dejected. Did I get my money's worth? Maybe. $1/hour isn't bad. But seeing the possibilities is the huge issue that everyone that comes here to complain is having.  The ground that ED is built on is fine, fantastic even. Ship handling, graphics, sound design. The foundation weak. Combat, trading, instancing, ship choice, weapon variety. And the grand tower that FD is building on top of this foundation is shaky. Powerplay, planetary landings, FPS? Powerplay can already be considered as ""not meeting expectations"". What does the future hold?  I'll be back every major content update until I have completely lost hope but until then, the foundation needs solidifying."
EliteDangerous,3e3jge,ArmyDude956,2,Tue Jul 21 19:32:21 2015 UTC,"Nobody can really disagree with this, great points. While I still love the game and play it constantly, the first few hours give a dreamlike impression that fades quickly. Though I guess that could be said for any game that doesn't greatly mix things up every now and then."
EliteDangerous,3e3jge,Phil_T_Casual,8,Tue Jul 21 19:38:18 2015 UTC,"just take a pause and wait for some new awesome updates   I'd say it's fair to say that most people complaining have been doing just that.   We grinded and grinded to get the best ships and have plenty of cash in anticipation for upcoming updates.   1.1 and 1.2 were decent updates, adding useful features. Then the ""our biggest update yet"" announcement was made and the hype began. Hype that was mostly driven by FDev.    And what a pile of shit it turned out to be, it sucked most of the fun straight out of the game. Until 1.3 dropped I was very satisfied with the game and had little to complain about. But if this is the standard of ""awesome updates"" to come isn't it no wonder people are voicing their frustration.   With no road map for the game also announced at the same time as 1.3, and what looks like FDev are just going to plough on with PP, despite the game haemorrhaging players and groups opting out of their ""biggest update yet"" there's going to be a lot more complaining to come."

And with 1.3 PP is completely optional, so how does it suck all the fun out of the game? You said you had very few complaints pre-PP, so why don't you go back to what you were doing that was fun?"

The developers aren't really addressing our concerns at all. I've not bothered whining anywhere (unless you count this post) because I'm still enjoying the game but the lack of information that is shared with us is a bit annoying. What's going top happen to SCB's and sub-system targeting? That's been an issue from day 1. We're 7 months after v1.0 and there's no word of it. Then there's instancing, the latest CG's, and powerplay tweaks to address.  But we're getting CQC and some rollercoaster game. I guess that's good?  Honestly, I don't expect we'll see many significant improvements to what's in place. I just have this feeling that Frontier will add CQC and maybe we'll get planetary landings in a year and the problems we have now will still be present. And then our hope will lie with Star Citizen I guess. I don't want this to be true but I just have a feeling (I do want SC to be good though!)."
EliteDangerous,3e3jge,mattigus,10,Tue Jul 21 18:19:17 2015 UTC,"They've addressed many things recently, including things you mentioned.

EliteDangerous,3e3jge,ArmyDude956,4,Tue Jul 21 18:24:52 2015 UTC,"Hopefully it all pans out. In the grand scheme of things, the last 7-8 months have seen basically two things: Wings, and PowerPlay. One should have been in place since forever. The other has kind of fizzled.  Again, I have to stress that I've put an insane amount of time in this game and still enjoy it but things are moving sooooooooooooooooooooooooo slowly. The subsystem/SCB issue has been a sticking point for a very long time and the upcoming proposed changed is a simple band-aid solution.

EliteDangerous,3e3jge,mattigus,2,Tue Jul 21 18:59:14 2015 UTC,"mission overhaul was absolutely massive   And then, not only such an overhaul might bring it up to par with the older games (which is something I do expect, in regards to the mission system), but that would be aligned with all those complaints about grinding (which I do not agree with) and lack of content...

EliteDangerous,3e3jge,moorent,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:41:16 2015 UTC,CQC is a mode within Elite for smaller ships to duke it out in interesting locations that has game modes similar to capture the flag.  The roller coaster game is completely new/separate. Another project they are working on.
EliteDangerous,3e3jge,ArmyDude956,-2,Tue Jul 21 18:59:52 2015 UTC,"Well and that's what I mean with being a doomsayer for no reason...Do Frontier really give you the feeling that they don't care about the game and it's players? I am just looking forward for everything coming like Planetary Landings, CQC, FPS mode. It only will get better!"
EliteDangerous,3e3jge,moorent,3,Tue Jul 21 18:29:24 2015 UTC,It only will get better!   Did Powerplay make the game better?
EliteDangerous,3e3jge,ArmyDude956,5,Tue Jul 21 18:34:37 2015 UTC,"It's an opinion of course, but I get what you're going at, so I'll say ""no"". But did it make it worse? It is an optional thing...  That shouldn't be accepted, of course. We should only want things that improve the game, but it didn't ruin the entire game, you can ignore it entirely."
EliteDangerous,3e3jge,moorent,0,Tue Jul 21 18:36:27 2015 UTC,"Not really, I agree. Powerplay was pretty shit. But why be a doomsayer and conclude that everything else will be shit, too?"
EliteDangerous,3e3jge,ComJak,2,Tue Jul 21 18:46:31 2015 UTC,"Because FD hasn't provided nearly the amount of communication or transparency  we received when the game was still in development.   Because we are receiving (shitty, imo) features like Powerplay instead of increased variety in smuggling/trading/bountyhunting missions. And to top it off, powerplay launched without sufficient testing (hence the rush to retroactively alter cc calculations), and a severe lack of tools available for player organization. This total lack of foresight is troubling and calls into question the direction of this game.  While there are many players who are completely alright playing the game with their imagination and creating their own stories or whatever, there is very little to do for players who want some semblance of structured gameplay. Want to make credits? You can grind RES's over and over, you can Trade back and forth between stations, or for a more thrilling experience, trade in an endless loop (which, unless you have hours to kill, you will probably need to find using a third-party site because even though we have mastered the art of compressing space and allowing FTL travel we are somehow unable to create a system that allows us to view actual market data remotely) Mining is terrible income for the time invested and is more frustrating than it has to be, and exploration feels like charity work.   Although there is no way of knowing, because FD seems to feel that giving any sort of concrete information would create a raging inferno of unreasonable expectations, I don't see planetary landings as an addition that will do much more than add more (planetary) stations for you to cash in your grind rewards. Maybe I'm wrong though, who knows?  TLDR- We aren't being given meaningful content and most people who feel otherwise are manufacturing their own fun (good for you) or haven't spent a lot of time in-game.  This game feels like that episode of The Office (US) where Michael promises his staff a big surprise at the end of the day but doesn't really have anything planned. In the end they get shitty, half-melted ice cream sandwiches."
EliteDangerous,3e3jge,ArmyDude956,2,Tue Jul 21 19:13:00 2015 UTC,"This game feels like that episode of The Office (US)   I am literally just 2 minutes into an episode of The Office as I read that, if it's the episode you just mentioned I don't even know what I'll do"

EliteDangerous,3e3jge,ComJak,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:22:11 2015 UTC,Hm I can partly agree with you. Still I know for a fact that Braben and the whole Frontier community are very involved in the game and community and care about it! I personally can't imagine how they could make planetary landings bad.
EliteDangerous,3e3jge,ArmyDude956,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:25:31 2015 UTC,"Just curious, what do you expect from planetary landing?"
EliteDangerous,3e3jge,dzanm,2,Tue Jul 21 19:34:20 2015 UTC,"I don't understand the hype for planetary landings. What features do you expect with landing that will greatly increase the longevity of the game? I assume that planets will be no different than a starbase stuck in the ground with nothing else to do. Wildlife? Constructs? Without explorable bases/FPS, after you visit the first 10 planets, what distinguishes one planet from the next? Without full FPS implementation, what is the point of planetary landing?"
EliteDangerous,3e3jge,ComJak,2,Tue Jul 21 18:43:46 2015 UTC,"https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/3dm4oe/back_by_popular_demand_the_devs_answer_your/ct6j1ta   What could be done:  Flying and just fooling around cities and landscapes  Dogfights in atmosphere  Delivering people (yay Orca and Dropship pls?)  Mining on the surface of metal rich planets   Basically, what was in Elite: Frontier. Planets were amazing in that game and you couldn't leave your ship either!"
EliteDangerous,3e3jge,dzanm,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:46:18 2015 UTC,"Those aren't confirmed or anything.  "" operate land and underwater vehicles and walk on entire 1:1 scale populated planets with NPCs in living cities, forests and be able to big-game hunt wildlife, like chasing big dinosaurs around as part of expansions.""  These are what I expect most people are waiting for. Flying around is fine and dandy and will probably be super exciting for the first few days. Dogfights? unless the physics change drastically, I don't see that making a big difference either. Delivering people is the same as delivering cargo but for the Orca and Dropship. Mining caves and stuff would be cool but realistically, it's probably the same as mining an asteroid."
EliteDangerous,3e3jge,forsayken,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:56:05 2015 UTC,"Of course they aren't confirmed, they're just ideas. Like I said, Elite: Frontier did it perfectly fine, it was the best part of that game."
EliteDangerous,3e3jge,DarkNetV2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:56:56 2015 UTC,Unfortunately I never played the earlier elites nor have any desire to. What did frontier do to make it the best part of the game?
EliteDangerous,3e3jge,davideli,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:59:38 2015 UTC,"I haven't played it either, I'll admit I'm just going off what I've heard many other people have said about planetary landings in that game. It certainly can be interesting in just your spaceship."
EliteDangerous,3e3jge,SquanchingOnPao,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:03:42 2015 UTC,"It was something unheard of back then. I remember the day my cousin shown me the game for the first time (it has been out for a while, and by then the best 'space flight game' I had played was the old X-Wing game), seeing him take off from a planet, fly into space, dock at a station, then launch and land at another planet (or was it at another place in the same planet?)... that was awesome! And he hadn't even figured out that you could warp to another system!  Have you played with the DK2? I haven't yet - I'm gonna try to get an Occulus once they are released - but from what I've seen, I'd say it's the same kind of feeling."
EliteDangerous,3e3jge,steelch,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:29:54 2015 UTC,No I haven't used DK2. I do have TrackIR but obviously it doesn't compare. I also don't really want to invest that much in something that will only be used for one game. HOTAS and TrackIR is enough of an investment.  Evochron Mercenary had planetary landing and even a mech to walk around on. That game piqued my interest for a while after ED but I never got around to playing it.
EliteDangerous,3e3jge,dzanm,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:35:12 2015 UTC,"I've played Evochron a couple years ago. I really liked it, but didn't have a proper joystick to play and fighting was kinda hard with the mouse and keyboard IIRC. Now that I got one (a Logitech joystick, not a HOTAS - good enough for me) I'll have to play it again."
EliteDangerous,3e3jge,GetawayGecko,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:44:06 2015 UTC,I just want what we have now to be fixed and balanced and working well because a bunch of other things are tacked on. I am still optimistic that everything will be fine but it seems lately that the bare minimum is being done and efforts are focused elsewhere. That's all.
EliteDangerous,3e3jge,Graf_Von_Tasihl,3,Tue Jul 21 19:01:18 2015 UTC,"This might be a little far fetched, but I believe this community changed because of a shift from open play to private/solo. The majority of interaction with strangers in open play is interdictions, pirating/pvp. Please recognise the emphasis with strangers. It's been a long time since I met a CMDR in open who would wing up for the fun of it.  (Based on personal experience)"

EliteDangerous,3e3jge,BradenFontaine,3,Tue Jul 21 19:35:57 2015 UTC,I am a week in and I don't care if this game goes to complete shit. The fun I have had the past few days cannot be measured. No other game has come close lately to what this game has given me. I just finished the Witcher 3 then decided to play this. Don't get me wrong I liked the Witcher but this game(with 3 of your friends on headsets)figuring out how the hell to play this game is insanely fun. Please tell me what MMO's out there aren't a grind?
EliteDangerous,3e3jge,Graybie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:22:52 2015 UTC,Actually in my opinion every game includes grinding. Even in PvP games like LoL or CsGo you grind games to rank up. It just depends on how fun it is.
EliteDangerous,3e3jge,BradenFontaine,8,Tue Jul 21 19:30:22 2015 UTC,"Amazing games attract a lot of people. Sadly some lack patience and understanding, while expecting miracles. These people won't stick around forever, luckily. Those who love the game, and support it's developers every step will stay, and we'll end up with an even more amazing game. Patience :)"
EliteDangerous,3e3jge,criticalt3,4,Tue Jul 21 18:24:42 2015 UTC,"Sadly some lack patience and understanding, while expecting miracles.   This.   While I agree that there are things that could be improved a lot, IMHO (as someone who works with software development) the current development pace, those patches, the way they reach out to the community, all of that shows that they're aware of the problems, working on it, trying to prioritize stuff (even if we don't agree on the priority assigned to some issues - and remember, they have limited resources, so they gotta prioritize stuff while keeping an eye on their plans), all of that while developing new features (and here I mean both the XBox stuff that for some reason people hate, but which I believe in general will be positive for the PC version too, and the other stuff that they talked about as far back as in the Kickstarter campaign, like the planetary landings).  I don't believe they'll get everything sorted out and done in X time (some people seem to want everything done and fixed by tomorrow or else!), but I think the game is very enjoyable right now, and in, say, 6 months, it will be way better."
EliteDangerous,3e3jge,criticalt3,4,Tue Jul 21 19:12:59 2015 UTC,"I bought this game a long time ago when it was in beta. When they announced they were taking offline play away (kind of) I seized my opportunity to get a refund under somewhat false pretenses.*   I could see back then that E:D was going to be a prettier, sci-fi version of Euro Truck Simulator, with absolutely no depth to its gameplay. People told me back then to stay positive, that it was still only in beta, and then it was suddenly going to explode in to this awesome game with meta-combat and deep persistence blah blah. Almost a year later, that hasn't happened.  The reason I'm posting this is not to brag about my incredible foresight (incredible as it is), but to offer a contradictory opinion against people saying the same thing today. Either way, have fun and best of luck commander. ;)  *Before you hate on me for that, I wasn't going to (because it felt dishonest), then I saw this minute-and-a-half lie and felt less trepidation. Also, well, although I used the offline mode thing as my 'official' reason, I still felt I'd been lied to about what the game would entail from the first day."
EliteDangerous,3e3jge,Rude_Canadian,4,Tue Jul 21 18:28:51 2015 UTC,"Complaining is always easier & less effort than being patient and/or supplying constructive & positive criticism.  It's as simple as is their ""glass half empty or half full"".  Personally I'm loving this game...with all its' growth anomalies.  I side on being patient, mostly because of the numerous amazing experiences this game provides. As well, my experience with this community, Reddit or in-game, has been very positive and enjoyable. I choose to ignore the haters/complainers.  Sure, it's not perfect, there's lots of room for improvement & features. But in my opinion ED is well worth the price to buy at full price.   I could go on and on about all the things I like about the game, as well as all items I'm frustrated with but the short of it, ED has lots of potential and I'm eager to see how the game evolves over the coming months/years."

EliteDangerous,3e3jge,ArmyDude956,5,Tue Jul 21 19:23:28 2015 UTC,"Hello commander, I'm a new player, just a few days old currently. I've browse this sub for interesting ideas and fun pictures, and general conversation. I've seen what you mean and it does sadden me a bit. I'm glad I didn't come here before I bought it. To me this game is everything I've ever wanted in a space flight sim and I'm looking very much forward to any and all updates. I'm having a lot of fun with it so far. All I'm doing is just rolling around doing bounties and trade missions and it's a hell of a time. I understand that it'll take me a long time to get anywhere, and that doesn't bother me at all. Imo that's what the universe is. You don't just start out in space, do a few missions for random contacts and become super rich. If we were living space life it would be extremely hard to afford even the most basic ship. So I feel like it's right on point. At any rate, that's my two cents. I hope a new player like me can instill some hope that the community isn't all bad."

EliteDangerous,3e3jge,edenroz,2,Tue Jul 21 19:25:58 2015 UTC,"I'll tell you the exact problems -    One of the biggest problems, FDev has betrayed its consumer base time and time again and treats it like shit. For instance, in the kickstarter, they promised that ""if Elite: Dangerous expands to any other platform, PC will always remain our top priority, and all future expansions and content will be released on PC first"". And yet, the first chance they get from microsoft, they reneg on that and choose to release 1.4/cqc first on XB1 just to make an extra quick dollar. A few months back they said they were looking for a way to incentivize open play, to ""give benefits to CMDRs who stick it out in open"". In the last dev q&a they decided to throw out that idea too. There's countless other things as well, such as Michael Brookes saying it was an accident custom weapons (overcharged, scattershot) were removed permanently, and we would see them in a couple weeks. Months have passed and they aren't back. They said back in 1.0 they were planning on adding FSD inhibition secondary functions to interdictors, hopefully released by 1.1, ""definitely released by 1.2 at the latest"". 1.4 is around the corner and there's still no word on it. FDev ignores most complaints from players until the problem is way out of hand. Look at all the different people who went around open play, blatantly hacking, even streaming their hacks over twitch and taunting Frontier. In one case, after 2 months of hacking, FDev finally took action. They gave him a stern warning. A week later he was back at it again, and they finally shadowbanned him.... for a week. FDev is so focused on their next big patch/content that they fail to see how broken and unstable the stuff they already have released is. It's like continuing to build a bridge ignoring the fact that the parts of the bridge you already built behind you are on fire. Bugged interdictions, instancing after interdiction/in general, combat logging, various wing exploits, etc are still about and rampant. Continuing with the last point, it seems FDev has no real intention of fixing the bugs in their games. Every single beta test for major releases so far has been treated like a ""super secret exclusive early access vip experience"" rather than an actual beta test. During the tests thousands of people report many different bugs, hundreds of them reporting the same ones, and yet a great deal of them still get ignored, even some of the most gamebreaking ones, and aren't fixed by release. I don't think there's been a single major release to date that didn't require multiple hotfixes within hours of release to keep the game from imploding in on itself. One of the last issues, but definitely not the least. As another person on this sub said a couple days ago, you can either build an engine, or a game, but not both. FDev is currently going for an engine it seems. Outside of hours upon hours of npc-whacking ""fun"", there's little to nothing to do after you complete the grind for an end game ship. Player-created content is what drives a game at this stage; it's what you're supposed to do in a game like this after you've put in the time to grind. And yet, the multiplayer aspect of this game is more broken than literally any other game that advertises multiplayer I've ever seen, even including indie games. Due to the lack of support for multiplayer and end-game content, people are bailing in droves, and those that are left are finally starting to lose hope if they haven't already. 1.3 was the last straw for many people; half a year without any major fixes for glaring multiplayer issues; they see it's still broken as hell and decide to move on."
EliteDangerous,3e3jge,WinterholdMage,5,Tue Jul 21 19:48:39 2015 UTC,"To be fair DayZ has gone absolutely nowhere since it's initial release, but yeah, at least wait until all hope is lost until you turn into /r/dayz. I agree with you, this used to be an awesome, positive community. I'm not saying don't criticize, that's what the devs need, but you can't go anywhere on here now without somebody making a sarcastic comment about the game and being praised for it. That doesn't help the devs in any way, be constructive. And if you reply with ""yeah but I don't care about the game/devs"", I say why are you even here then?"
EliteDangerous,3e3jge,edenroz,4,Tue Jul 21 18:05:52 2015 UTC,"There are still quite a bit of positive people around,  the problem was that the last update was a big hit and miss for a lot of people that expected more multi-player content or less repetitive single-player content.   Don't get me wrong,  I really like powerplay, I like the concept and the feeling of community,  but the way it barely rewards new activities and encourages more grind for the biggest rewards is just a major deal breaker for all.   Also,  the people that play Elite the most are the ones that feel  a really big disconnect between PP and the main game: not only it's barely implemented within the whole 3 major powers,  there isn't much connectivity with minor factions,  systems' economies and government types."

EliteDangerous,3e3jge,InevitableMrPanda,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:12:29 2015 UTC,It's just that I am usually a regular guest on this subreddit and enjoy reading through new posts. I always do that with games that I am interested it. However lately it has been way less enjoyable because everywhere I go people are crying and bitching about the game.
EliteDangerous,3e3jge,noodlz05,3,Tue Jul 21 18:17:33 2015 UTC,"I suspect that people turn hostile towards ED because they buy it and then discover that it's a prime example of a carrot on a stick.  The game seems to be about a vast, open universe full of possibilities. After a while, it turns out that it's got an empty universe where you do nothing of interest.  The only thing left to do is try and get the top-end ships. But: I played this game for maybe 300 hours now? I made it to a Vulture.  300 hours and nowhere near a top-end ship. Coupled with the problem of the game being empty and with nothing interesting to do in it, I'd say that: yes. It is kind of a boring grind-fest. It could have been a fun grind-fest, but it's not.  People expect clans/guilds, the possibility of becoming a player with power and influence (clan leader, hero, etc.), a crafting system, quests that are actually fun, NPCs,   This game has got none of that. It's more like a planetarium with some gameplay thrown in as an afterthought. In other words, the setting and premise in ED is more important than the actual game.

EliteDangerous,3e3jge,NekoMaid69,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:44:11 2015 UTC,That's not what I meant and you know that... I am talking about the immersion this game is providing which will only get better with future content. And sorry but 300 hours and you are in a vulture? What did you do wrong? Even if you have never tried bounty hunting nor trading you could've gotten more...
EliteDangerous,3e3jge,Dragoneye190,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:52:24 2015 UTC,"Immersion is no substitute for gameplay :-/  And not sure how I could have gotten more credits. I did a lot of missions, some bounty hunting and a little trading. I made something like 20mil and fully upgraded a Vulture. For a fully upgraded Python I need something like 200mil?  If your way of doing it is sitting in a RES and killing wave after wave of enemies for hours on end, or becoming a truck driver and hauling trade goods from A to B, then I have to say I'm sorry. That's not my idea of fun :-/ None of these things are interesting. Flying around is interesting, but that earns you zero credits and is only part of the setting of the game.  In a ""normal"" MMO, these grindy things become fun because of player roles. You get someone to tank, someone to heal, someone to do DPS, etc. The fun emerges from the different ways people need to play, and from the player count itself (a party of 12 people for example, instead 4 this game offers.) ED doesn't have that. The grind becomes boring after a short while. Thus, the game either needs to introduce such player roles (healer ships? yeah, not sure...) or move the income-generating things somewhere else. Where? No idea. I'm not a game designer."
EliteDangerous,3e3jge,ArmyDude956,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:15:25 2015 UTC,"Immersion can help make the gameplay more fun though. If you don't think about how to make the most credits but just do what you want to and ""roleplay a bit in your mind"". What I mean is go into a RES thinking about how you are going to shoot those pesky pirates since you are a feared bounty hunter and have fun blowing stuff up. Don't go into it thinking "" okay if I farm this for 5 hours I will probably get ***** credits"". Also actually flying around can earn you credits. Missions or exploring or even trading, actually everything requires you to fly, doesn't it? ;)"

EliteDangerous,3e32lz,mens-rea,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:14:25 2015 UTC,"Ok, total noob here, but I have a million questions:  1) I assume you're running silent (hence the heatsinks and the stealth). Does that mean that gimballed weapons won't track you? (making it harder to hit you) and that you won't be targetable? Does that apply the whole fight?  2) I noticed the other guys were also becoming untargetable for brief moments. Were they dropping into silent mode as well or was that something else (the chaff?)  3) I see you have chaff and heat sinks both  on the same fire group. How are you using one without the other?  4) If the heat builds up too high during silent mode, will you be targetable?  5) Why are missiles better than say some projectile weapons? Higher burst?  6) I recently got wrecked by an Anaconda (yeah, I get that I'm dumb for taking that mission), but I was wondering if this silent strategy would help? Would the turrets be unable to track me, giving me free hits? Or would the AI manually aim them at me with some degree of success?  7) If I wanted to try this (in my Eagle), what are the important things I should know? Obviously heatsinks are one. What do you replace the shields with?"
EliteDangerous,3e32lz,I-D-A-C,5,Tue Jul 21 18:24:35 2015 UTC,"Your ship is untargetable outside of 500M so long as it's running silent and not over 100% heat.  The other pilots used the same silent running method, making them untargetable. Silent running disables your shields. You can bind independent keys to launch chaff and heat sinks, I don't think he has them assigned to a firegroup. Yes. Use heat sinks to avoid this. Missiles do heaps of damage to hull if they hit their target. AIs currently completely ignore silent running and can target you anyway, unfortunately this method is not viable for PVE. :( Replace your shields with a few hull reinforcements, use armor (reinforced/mirrored surface composite), use weapons that won't generate too much heat (avoid beams). Always have an escape plan."
EliteDangerous,3e32lz,Terrorpist,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:29:46 2015 UTC,Your answers are correct.
EliteDangerous,3e32lz,Terrorpist,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:46:47 2015 UTC,"Awesome! Super appreciate it! The buttons for the heatsink/chaff makes sense. I suppose I have a couple on my thrust stick that aren't bound to anything useful.  Couple of follow up questions:  1) So I want weapons that don't use a lot of heat, but don't I still want beams to take shields down faster for the missiles?  2) In an Eagle, what loadout would I want? 1 gun for the shields and 2 missiles? Also, since I only have 1 utility hardpoint, I would want heatsink over chaff? Can missiles even track you if you're running silent?"
EliteDangerous,3e32lz,iyaerP,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:20:00 2015 UTC,"I would use 1 burst laser and two missile racks. Torpedoes could work too, but they have two problems:   They lock on slowly. Sometimes they glitch out and the get stuck inside your ship and (sometimes) killing you.   But the torpedoes pay off with high ammount of damage and they stick to the enemy a little bit faster and longer than the missile racks."
EliteDangerous,3e32lz,sushi_cw,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:28:44 2015 UTC,"Mack basically answered it. On 3, I use Voice attack and you just aren't hearing me tell it the commands.   On 4, Mack is correct and when youre limited on sinks you want to try to balance it so you only have to use sinks when youre in front of them and then turn off silent running when you can get behind them.  I really hate that the AI just ignores half the available play styles. So dumb."

Of course, if there were an actual economy, Imperial Slaves (the staple of any good Imperial trade run) would probably soar in price, which would make people question why certain factions would outlaw them, thus driving people away from those factions. That's not what FDev wants.  And that's the biggest thing. FDev doesn't want a player-driven galaxy. They want a curated simulation where they handmake anything that would affect the galaxy in any meaningful way.

EliteDangerous,3e2xns,eponra,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:50:26 2015 UTC,"--- slightly offtopic---  So im in EvE since 2006. EvE is something different, and it has its up and downs like any mmo, but it is very hard to compare with other mmos out there.  The same counts for E:D. Where i love the (often through player created) gameplay and the art of fitting a ship and going out for a hunt, it isnt in that way immersive like E:D is. In EvE im not exactly the pilot, i see my ship from the outside. Im the head of a corp, the manager of a mining-branch of an alliance, but im never really the pilot.  In E:D im right in the seat of a m€%f#&ing small ship, burning my way through solar systems. Im out of air fast, if my cockpit is cracked, and im dead fast if im going to fast into a station (or a sun...).  In EvE you sit outside of your ship. If you press ""d"", it docks on its own, magically disappearing a few miles before the very station. Thats not really immersive.  (dont get me wrong, i like EvE very much) ---/slightly offtopic---  The market in EvE is, more or less, player driven and full of opportunities to get rich, loose some, or get totally destroyed by a scam.  The market in E:D is pretty straight forward. You get what you pay for. You directly see the influence of anything you buy for your ship. If you see something you want to trade for a good price, you have the time to go for the search of it, return, and settle the deal. Thats a kind of ""safety"" you wont see in EvE.  Maybe not even in X(3).  Based on what i said, i cant imagine a way of getting ""crafting"" into E:D.  But what i can see is Player Corporations. I dont know how to integrate that though..."
EliteDangerous,3e2xns,spacetimebear,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:27:13 2015 UTC,With the current state of the game there is absolutely no downside to having official ingame clans. People clan up anyway and large groups are already affecting ingame flow. I honestly can not understand why FDev do not want to implement official clans. It could just function like a big automatic Wing sort of system for now with additional functionality as the game evolves.
EliteDangerous,3e2xns,katsai,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:23:00 2015 UTC,"I agree that E:D does need some sort of social player structure. Guilds, corps, whatever. Some folks have suggested player owned bases, which could be cool depending on how it's implemented. It could go two ways. You could either have a POS that's yours but not attackable, or you could have them be conflict points.   Each approach has its downsides. Non-attackable POS would still be vulnerable to camping if a rival corp decides to take out some hostility towards you, meaning either you can't get out of your station or back into it until the blockade is lifted or the blockaders get bored. Attackable POS shifts the focus of the game from the three faction system the devs currently seem to want to an Eve-type sovereignty system where unclaimed space can be taken and held or fought over by the corps. Some people want that, some don't. I can see the fun, but I've also been ganked in Eve for flying through the wrong part of 0.0 space without realizing I was trespassing. Adding a sov mechanism also opens up the ability for a large corp to take over huge swaths of the galaxy on popular trade routes, effectively locking portions of the player base out of those systems if they so choose. Not sure most people are ready for the wild west style hardcore pvp that type of game would engender.   TL;DR Player corps and POS would be cool socially, but could cause problems in the long run if sovereignty is implemented."

""Nemorensis"" is sort of interesting, definetely not what I expected when I read the description; luckily, because it makes it sound like some sort of romance-in-space deal while it's more of a mix of ""Natural Born Killers"" and wild hunt related mythology.

EliteDangerous,3e2mjl,ArmyDude956,3,Tue Jul 21 14:50:48 2015 UTC,"Copy & paste (some great screenshots on the page, worth visiting):   There are 400 billion star systems in Elite: Dangerous. Here's the 10 you've visited the most.  10. Frigaha ~ The popular Engle Orbital station is in Frigaha, a Class G star system which is a white yellow main sequence star. Frigaha is also only 73.52 ly away from Sol.  9. Alrai Sector MC-V b2-7 ~ Unremarkable in most ways, MC-V b2-7 is very popular with traders.   8. Kini ~ Importing Microbial Furnaces, Bauxite and Rutile, Kini has an economy based around Refinery systems.   7. LTT 18486 ~ With a starport that is quite a distance from the star, the trading runs and missions that are completed in LTT 18486 are seen as lucrative if a little time-consuming.   6. Yakabugai ~ Serebrov Station is one of Yakabugai's hotspots, with some commanders claiming they've found 'a station that has it all!'   5. Kremainn ~ With resource extraction sites located close to stations, Kremainn is popular among bounty hunters.   4. Alrai Sector KH-V b2-1 ~ Alrai Sector KH-V b2-1 is a fairly unremarkable system, with no starports and no planets nearby, it is surprising that it's so high up this list. But as a stepping stone to another location it serves a huge number of commanders.   3. Potriti ~ Some say Potriti is a good system to spot green pilots who need a helping hand, some say it's a fine place for pirates to track down their next mark, but all we know is that it's visited by a large number of commanders.   2. LHS 3447 ~ It may come as a surprise that the starting system isn't the most-visited system in the galaxy. Sneaking a peek behind the curtain a little bit: the player's starting system isn't recorded, only the first destination you jump to, so LHS 3447 gets no head start over other systems.   1. Eravate ~ Local to LHS 3447, although it could be described as a modest star system, Eravate is still capable of supporting a mixed agriculture and industrial economy."

But if it does drop, I want ample time to finish off the bastard that broke it before proceeding to a station of my choice for repairs.  I've been flying the Vulture for quite some time, so I can't get it out of my head that almost as soon as my shields drop, my canopy will follow. I hate having to break off as soon as that happens, I'd prefer to stick around and finish the job.  Still, I'm not entirely happy with that kit. It's great when taking on larger ships, but it seems most of my time is spent fighting smaller ships where I can't properly use over half of my weapons. I'll try dropping to C rated life support for the gimballed cannon before trying some other kit. Sensors are the other module I won't drop under C rated, so seeing as I haven't actually taken any hull damage on my FdL yet I'll just drop life support down."
EliteDangerous,3e15p8,badcookies,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:59:27 2015 UTC,My rule is 1 SCB left = time to run... live to fight another day (and save an hour+ worth of RES grinding to pay off the insurance...)  It's 4 pips to engines and boosting away... the FDL gets away quite well compared to the vulture IMO and assuming i'm not fighting an anaconda or another FDL ... I will get away  I play most games like this... my goal tends to be more about staying alive and less about more credits or glamorous exploding enemies.  I played over 150 hours with the vulture and never lost shields once... only hull damage i ever took was over heating / harsh interdiction drops.  Different play style though :D
EliteDangerous,3e15p8,UrMom306,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:22:45 2015 UTC,"Maybe i'm a noob but so far i've not found life support particularly valuable... If you've fought long enough to loose a canopy in most situations you get blown up anyway... 5 minutes of o2 seems like plenty if you do escape, in most situations that's enough time to get back to safety.  Maybe 10 minutes if you're in a sparse system(s) frequently...   You're dual shield cell bank set up is wicked - I had gone with one but keeping a second turned off makes a lot of sense, especially for pvp encounters.  IMO my experience so far with cannons and PA is that that projectiles travel far to slow to hit most ships over 500m ... the literally have to roll/pitch/yaw like 5 degrees or less and the whole shot is lost... most shots miss seemingly because the enemy pilot was just manuvering- not even evasively ... just manuveraing gradually :/  I would expect a cannon- especially a big one like the C4 to be a really loud POW and see a big slug fly out at of M/s ... i'm not sure their current rate of travel but it doesn't seem enough.  Modern day artillery rounds are fired between 700 - 1000  M/s  ... I'd expect futuristic cannons could be even more powerful."

They're there for the sole purpose of me killing them. And these guys are supposed to be worth hundreds of thousands?   I get that it's procedural. But it's so fucking sterile. ""Okay, user accepted mission, generate target for him to shoot. Congratulations at shooting target user. Get reward.""   It's about as little ""game"" as you can get.   How about they also maybe act as somewhat of a threat? How about give them some tricks? Some variety? Literally anything?

The Oculus Rift (DK2) made it fun, I was in space! but in the end I put the headset on, fired up the game and realised that there was no point playing. I turned it off minutes later without even undocking. Everything was a grind, nothing meaningful ever changed in the universe. Dice-roll events, endless wanted NPCs in resource extraction sites. Power play to me is so obviously just another grind sitting on-top of the universe. CQC is irrelevant to me.  I'm hoping that at some point Frontier start to allow users to shape the universe and stop trying to nanny it. To allow us to create content and interaction and risk, danger and reward, but I don't have much hope anymore.  Why do I come to this subreddit still?  This requires some history. I love space games. I bought the game in early Beta (I paid extra for it!), I even submitted bug reports. Not only that, I bought another two beta copies at that same higher price for my two daughters. I bought an X-55 HOTAS. I wanted the game to be great, and like many people playing the beta I enjoyed it, in part because of the gameplay, but in a large way because of the possibility of amazing things to come. We could see the game eventually turning into an epic and deep space simulation.  And then came the release announcement. There were many people on this subreddit who played the beta who said Frontier must be holding back some game content, they had to be because the game wasn't finished. It wasn't the game we wanted or imagined, and it just wasn't ready. It was pretty much three grindy careers on top of a procedurally generated load of spheres. It had potential to be so much more but this wasn't it.  Release day came and went, weeks came and went, and no large updates happened. The unfinished game remained unfinished. I did what I could. I got a Viper then a Vulture, I bounty hunted (for me the least grindy of mining, trading and bounty hunting and exploring) but the stupidity of it overwhelmed me. I was blowing up an endless stream of dumb as hell NPCs (""Let's see what you're carrying"" says the wanted clipper to the A-rated Vulture surrounded by police before I despatched it with ease and no emotion), but for what? Nothing changed, and seemingly gaps in gameplay were explained away with lore.  Finally to answer the question, I come back to this subreddit because I want the game to be amazing. I want it to be a deep, changing game with content and players and progress and construction and collaboration and frontiers and all the other stuff we dreamed about when the game was in Beta. Maybe one-day it will, or maybe one day I'll just uninstall the game and stop coming to this sub."

EliteDangerous,3dzo6w,StoopidSpaceman,2,Mon Jul 20 23:51:20 2015 UTC,"I actually tried trading for the first time in awhile today, I don't think it's quite as profitable as bounty hunting without a really big ship (at least a type 7) anymore. I was making 100-150k a run in a type 6 but I just made 2 mil in the time it took me to listen to the full 40 oz to freedom album.  But yeah the reason why I only just got an asp is that once I could afford a decent cobra I just did pirating for a really long time which makes absolutely no money"
EliteDangerous,3dzo6w,Mement012,2,Tue Jul 21 02:45:39 2015 UTC,Yeah I hear you. I just really hated the Asp...personal preference I guess. So I got the type 6 and got into the swing of trading. Max cargo space in a type 6 nets at least 450k round trip between two systems with a decent route. I was in a clipper in a couple days and now in trading in that until I can kit it out for combat.

But I realized I was making more bounty hunting anyway which is why I got the Vulture back. Also I got pirated (I trade in open when possible) and got destroyed on the second intervention, though not before unloading a volley of missiles into his unshielded vulture, hehehe.   How do you make 450k round trip? I was making 1000-1500 each way (2500 per ton round trip) and with 100 cargo spaces that comes out to be 250k round trip in a type 6, and that was with the help of thrudds trading tool to find a route. I keep the shields on my type 6 though, I've found the extra cargo space doesn't warrant the extra risk."

EliteDangerous,3e2jqz,Drazyr,2,Tue Jul 21 15:35:02 2015 UTC,"If you're between the x-55 and the x52, get the x55.  Note it DOES still have QA issues, but as it is a common(ish) issue, you will be able to RMA for a new one without any issue.  And the cool thing is that if you do have any issues with either the stick or throttle... you only need to send in the unit that is broken.  So if you have a bad stick and a good throttle, you send in the stick and then when you get your RMA set (they can only send a full new set) you will then have a spare Throttle just in case.  I have an Org mate (for StarCitizen) that had to RMA twice, once for the stick, once for the throttle, so now he has a fully functional second x55 along side the one he actually uses."

EliteDangerous,3e2jqz,WinterborneTE,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:58:37 2015 UTC,"I just dealt with that. I bought a refurbished Saitek x55 Rhino for $110, and it had all kinds of build issues. Various switches on the throttle would stick, and even though the flightstick's LEDs lit up, the buttons were not responsive. I suspected a poor connection between the flightstick and its base, and sure enough there was about 2mm of movement on the plastic housing. I tried to tighten the mini-screws, but one of them was already stripped.  So I sent it back to Amazon and bought one new for $155. No problems at all really, build quality is pretty good. I think I'll need to re-lubricate (dry lubricant!) the stick soon, and the stick creaks a bit when twisting and squeezing, but otherwise it's been acceptable.  Lesson: Never buy a refurbished HOTAS."

Flaps Switch = Cargo Scoop  Docking Computer = Autopilot Engage/Disengage Switch (I don't use a docking computer but if I ever decide to it is intuitively bound).  Reverse thrust = Paddle switch hold.  Boost = Big Red Button on throttle  TARGET forward = China Hat forward (Target Forward plays well with trackir and will target whatever you are looking at)  Etc.  I don't use voice attack because I have about 10 switches I don't use. It's cool to be able to talk to your ship and all but I dont need it for functionality.

EliteDangerous,3e2jqz,vsTerminus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:12:59 2015 UTC,"Ill try and post my binding graphic after work.  As an aside, there is simply nothing like DCS with the warthog and headtracking, so if you're going to be doing stuff other than just Elite, highly recommended. It is super immersive to be able to think ""Oh what is my APU Start keybind"" and then realize you just reach down and flip the backlit switch that is labelled APU Start.   YMMV, I fly in the real world as well so I much prefer having physical switches at hand, and I am used to the weighty movements of real controls, so I always find stuff like X52 lacking (I owned one before I took the warthog plunge).  I play DCS, Elite, SC, and Arma with mine and regret nothing."
EliteDangerous,3e2jqz,vsTerminus,2,Tue Jul 21 15:35:47 2015 UTC,"I recently upgraded from the Saitek X52 Pro to CH Products Fighterstick. I also used to have a regular X52, and my brother uses the Warthog. I've tested all the major players (except for the X55).   My thoughts:  X52, X52 Pro, X55 (I'm guessing) - best budget option. For $160 you get everything you need to play Elite. X/Y/Z movement, a decent selection of switches, and good compatibility. You'll start to feel the lack of customizability if you want to bind everything, and on the X52 range the button placement (Switches on the joystick) and Throttle buttons are both a bit lacking. In particular, the joystick itself has three two way switches that are a pain to reach over for. The other players have these switches on the throttle, so that you never have to reach with your left hand or let go with your right hand. Quality, for me, has proven to be an issue. The throttle detents on the X52 pro have broken, making it hard to maintain 100% throttle.   TM Warthog - big, heavy, solid, expensive, cool. The immersion factor of this joystick is hard to deny. Dropping you landing gear can be bound to a real switch. Same for cargo. You know how airline pilots flip a bunch of switches before taking off? You get to do that! I really like this joystick, but decided against it for a couple of reasons. First, price. The set is $400, and you'll need foot pedals to go with it (around $120). Second, weight. The joystick itself is designed to be mounted to a chair, so placing it on your desk doesn't supply you with ample enough leverage to move it around. Simply put, you're going to get very strong flying with this thing. That being said, my brother has one and loves it. It's not a stick you'd regret owning.  CH Fighterstick + CH Pro Throttle + CH Pedals - my current setup. Unexciting, professional, solid industrial plastic, light, and customizable. This isn't a setup most people go for initially (myself included). The whole system is pretty staid looking, and the Saitek with it's cool light up buttons is clearly the shinier of the bunch. However, the system is incredibly high quality. The throttle and stick feel great in your hand, with a smooth predictable action. You'll never fight the stick. The software is highly customizable, with the caveat that Elite is currently experiencing some issues remembering your bindings (known, being looked into). Since the stick and throttle are light, I mounted the two to my desk with 3M velcro stickies, and this has resulted in a massive improvement in feel (tip to Saitek users, do the same). All the reviews say the same thing: This stick looks like it came out of the 90's. It does. The software does. But I love it. When it works, the stick feels incredibly good. If you're willing to work a little with the software, using it is very rewarding.   tl;dr I like CH, Warthog is immersive, Saitek is the best cheapest way to play."

EliteDangerous,3e2jqz,vsTerminus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:24:08 2015 UTC,Thanks for the illustration and video link.  You've given me something to think about.
EliteDangerous,3e2jqz,vsTerminus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:43:39 2015 UTC,"In atmospheric flight you only have to worry about rotation (Pitch, Roll, and Yaw) and your throttle (forward translation).  In space you also have three kinds of translation you can use your thrusters to strafe left/right (Sway), up/down (Heave), and forward/backward (Surge).  In a dual stick setup the general idea is to put rotation in the right hand and translation in the left. However, due to preference and hardware limitation it's not always that simple: Many pilots prefer to keep Yaw to their rudder pedals and control Surging with the toe brakes. This way if you don't have a twist axis (or prefer not to use it) you can still control everything you need.  In this case, Roll and Pitch are in the right hand, with Swaying and Heaving in the left.  The advantage of a dual stick setup is that you get analog control over your strafing, which allows you to do things like manually match station rotation and have greater control over your ship while maneuvering through asteroid fields or in a dogfight.   Elite's flight model is designed to feel like atmospheric flight, but with a dual stick setup you don't actually have to play it like that. You are free to circle strafe with precision; something that is extremely difficult when all you have for thruster control is a hat switch on your throttle.  Edit: The Thrustmaster T16000M is widely considered one of the best (And only) ambidextrous sticks available. It will run you about $60."
EliteDangerous,3e2jqz,goto0,2,Tue Jul 21 15:04:50 2015 UTC,"That sounds like a lot of work and I don't think I could manage a dual stick, it sounds awesome I just don't think it's for me"

EliteDangerous,3dz5p9,HoochCow,2,Mon Jul 20 22:46:48 2015 UTC,"While only a couple weeks ago I was calling for Delaine Pilots to stay together I'm now considering dropping powerplay.  Its not that I have lost faith in the faction, or lost faith in powerplay, its just the current state of things.  Powerplay has turned Elite Dangerous into a Day Z-esque gankfest where Aligned CMDRS wing up and go hunt down anyone who isn't part of their power. While I'm all for PVP being a thing it has reached absurd proportions which brings me to my next point  The shit that goes on in PP Makes ZERO Fucking sense. Okay your HQ or Control System has such god awful fucking security that other powers be they NPCs or Players can just enter them and start shit without any system security wings coming after them with EVE High Sec Level Bloodthirst for Justice... I'm sorry but if you can't keep your own systems secure something is horribly horribly wrong with you. I expect unfortified control systems to be an exception, but your own HQ that's goddamn retarded.  Speaking of lack of shit making sense Why aren't the Feds and the Empire in an all out knock down drag out war? Feds have Imperials have both captured each others systems with militaristic means. These are clear acts of war, the fact we don't have Majestic Class Interdictors and Farragut Battlecruisers duking it out all over the Federal/Imperial border is just immersion breaking and a clear oversight for powerplay, there seems to be ZERO consequence for one superpower invading another.  The lack of PP based missions that are more than Take this allotment of cargo here, bring his allotment of cargo back, and go fight in this combat zone. As Galactic Powers and Superpowers shouldn't they be also upgrading their systems and expanding into uncharted or uninhabited territory growing the boundries of human space? Well I guess Delaine would be an exception because of how he operates but no were just moving in on each other taking over independent and superpower control systems without any repercussions.   Powerplay Weapons as a whole were a horrible idea because just as everyone predicted after week 4 loyality went out the window. CMDRs across the board began jumping ship to other powers to get their big shiny cannon or shield.  I've decided if I don't hear ANYTHING by Gamescom about FDEV fixing powerplays problems or improving whats wrong with it. I'm done. I'll still play Elite but I'll go back to being a lone commander out in the void."

I was moving my Anaconda with almost no shield, two classes lower thrusters, no weapons, and no cargo. I was just moving the ship from point A to point B... And a wing of four (Anaconda, FDL, Clipper and something that i didn't catch) murderers jumped me. Quite literally murderers, I had no bounty, I wasn't powerplay hostile to them (they had no faction at all) and I didn't have any cargo. It wasn't about pvp either, since I had no weapons and no defenses, right? I said i had no cargo, they took out my drives, i'm like... what are you waiting for, i've no cargo... and the guy said they just want to ""kill"" me so I just laughed at them how pathetic they are if all they can do is blow up defenseless ships... I was even tabbed out when they interdicted me :D  Good that you can't actually kill anyone thanks to our awesome escape pods :)   I hope that this is not the pvp you are talking about!"

If his windows 10 did indeed crash (which we don't even know, you could have just as easily pulled plug or killed elitedangerous32.exe and claimed your OS crash), I'd still say he's at fault anyways. FDev has said multiple times that windows 10 is not stable, and Elite is not adapted for its use anyways. If he decided to ignore FDev's warnings and carry on anyways, I'd say he's 100% at fault for anything that happens.  It's like riding a motorcycle without a helmet. Sure, you can do it, and it's not against any type of rule, but if it comes back and bites you in the ass (or cracks you in the skull), that's on you."
EliteDangerous,3e0onc,Sean71596,2,Tue Jul 21 04:39:36 2015 UTC,"Well, if you wanna think that way you can, but every time someone accidentally disconnects on me (sorahb has done this) I don't go rushing to the Reddit screaming about him being a combat logger. I understand that shit can happen whether it be losing connection to the internet in your home or your hardware is bugged. Hell, I have been crashing almost constantly lately because of graphics card driver issues.  If you were to ""combat log"" on me, I would talk to you about it and not go on a name smearing spree just to impress my friends. You know, because I'm an adult and I understand that things do happen.  Also with your motorcycle analogy, most states require you to wear a helmet to be compliant. If ED required Win8 or lower to be compatible, I'd agree with you here. No one in their right mind is only going to structure their main computer to only run via E:D script, its just a game."
EliteDangerous,3e0onc,MrSilk13642,0,Tue Jul 21 04:46:38 2015 UTC,"I feel obliged to respond, as you have mentioned me by name.  First off, I did not ""go rushing to the Reddit screaming about him being a combat logger."" All I did was apologize for my language on teamspeak which was played on the video. I did not post the video, even though I could have posted my footage as well. No one controls Jenner's actions but Jenner, despite your claims that he is our puppet. Whatever shit you two have between each other, keep it between you.  Secondly, regarding my only ""ungraceful"" exit, I have definitive proof the fault was not mine, which I supplied you with. Although we have asked for evidence that Nikolai had a legit crash, which could be verified with the dump files very easily, none has been forthcoming. I also had one of your members at 10% (?) hull and no drives while I was still had shields and was not taking fire, instead of shieldless with rapidly declining thrusters.  I really have nothing more to say on the matter, I only hope you keep my name out of this from now on."
EliteDangerous,3e0onc,RebelBastard,2,Tue Jul 21 05:21:02 2015 UTC,"Which is exactly why I never came to Reddit with it and everything was solved internally like it is supposed to be done instead of an intentional witch hunt thread stating that your group is now combat logging. Face it, Jenner is playing with you guys, he's on your TS, he's in your wings, what he does is linked with you and your group is now responsible for him. Personally if I had a member calling people the Nword and Fags I would disassociate myself with them. Also your comment was pretty inflammatory considering that you didn't give my member the same treatment that was given to you.  You're not a combat logger, I was using past experiences to support my argument."

I can confirm that CS have won the pvp aspect of AA-CS conflict. The fact that AA is leading backgroundsim war and CS doesn't, is not a win for AA. Not everyone shares the same opinion, the same goals, the same interests. Some people (AA) enjoy trashing other peoples hard work, others just enjoy a battle where both sides have the same ground (CS). CS has won their battle, achieved their goals, while you can say the same about AA and their goals - with a big exception. CS never tried to really push the background sim, while AA did try very very hard to beat CS in PvP - and failed.  This makes it a lot closer to a win for CS, rather than AA.    My opinion is very simple. AA don't know how to lose in PvP and will resort to bgsim wars instead. Strategy that I will never acknowledge as win, no matter the result."
EliteDangerous,3e0onc,RheaAyase,2,Tue Jul 21 13:11:30 2015 UTC,I can confirm that CS have won the pvp aspect of AA-CS conflict   I'm sure that has nothing to do with you siding with them in said fights

Hey I've got news for you... you know i've been there a few times, and you have not killed me a single time.   Some people (AA) enjoy trashing other peoples hard work   Sorry wait, are you defending the people who spent the past month doing exactly this? Have you not seen HIP 101760? There's a good reason CS is getting what they deserve. I know good people who worked hard on that system, and watched it get trashed in the blink of an eye by these people.  Sorry, I'll believe it when I see less of their exhaust pipes and more of them dying. You showed up late to the fight that night Rhea, people merely shot at you to keep you pushed away. The difference is I was communicating with their group the entire night and watched CS flee from us multiple times. There were deaths on both side but we kept coming back to fight while they, eventually, fled to the station.  AA might have the lead in the background sim but clearly I'm not believing in a Victor until it's clearer than that."

EliteDangerous,3e0onc,phantagor,-1,Tue Jul 21 16:42:42 2015 UTC,"I showed up first to the fight, there are actually friends in AA you know... I was talking with Wolfish the whole time so yeah i know exactly when did you guys show up and when did I show up. Half of CS side didn't get into instance and it was a fight 8vs4 one of which was me. After two of your ships blew up and two escaped, the rest of the CS had to bail as well, when the two escaped ships got back. Then I was left alone against 5 people, eventually another 6th guy jumped in. I've got 5 minutes of me trolling 6 ""pvp"" players on tape. Those 6 just couldn't do a thing to me... That was the only encounter the night you refer to, and I don't consider it a loss when you lost 4 ships (or had to bail) before the 4 of CS had to bail in a fight 4v8... Don't make me upload it. Also the only kills you've got was a Vulture, one guy, repeatedly, 8v1 - before the above mentioned encounter."
EliteDangerous,3e0onc,RheaAyase,0,Tue Jul 21 16:38:47 2015 UTC,"Like I said, the number of kills doesn't matter at the end of the day, which is why our dead pilots came back to fight. The fight ended when CS bailed to the station. If CS didn't hide in their station, the fight would have continued and there would have been a clear victory.  Anyone is going to have a tough time hitting the only small ship (imp Courier + strong shields) with fixed weapons/builds for FDLs and Pythons. Half of them were confused as to whos side you were on.  EDIT: people keep mentioning that it was 8v4, or 15v7, etc - why does this matter? How is it our fault CS didn't have any backup? Last time I checked that means they're outmatched."

Of course the followup question is whether or not class 3 is actually better than 2, I know it's not straight forward higher class = higher shields, but based on hull mass and given that the Courier is so light maybe 2A is actually the best shield for a Courier?  Edit: Just learned/realized it's governed by the internal compartment size. So to answer to the first part of my question is obviously 'yes'."

EliteDangerous,3e1vbb,berlinerbolle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:06:40 2015 UTC,"PowerPlay - Short answer. Long answer: You can pledge to one of 10 major powers. You are then an enemy and freely killable by anyone in a rival faction (Feds can kill non-Feds, Imps can kill non-Imps, etc). You can help complete PP objectives to Prep, Expand, and Fortify systems for your faction, and attempt to oppose other factions' attempts. You get merits for doing so, and at the end of the week, you are awarded a rank and reward based on your merits, which decay over time. You should always pledge to Arissa, because... Mining was never profitable, and it's still not, particularly in comparison to the other activity you can do in RES nodes: Bounty Hunting. I said pledge to Arissa because she gives a bonus to bounties, that gets very high at high PP tiers (T5 is something like 200%). There are multiple intensities of RES nodes, with HIRES spawning challenging, high-value criminals very frequently. You can easily snag 5mil/hr when you start out, and once you get good, around 40mil/hr. You can get mining drones. I wasn't aware there were ""mechanics"" of mining beyond shooting and collecting ore. Can't speak for mining, but the Cobra itself is a jack of all trades, master of none. There are better ships for every purpose.   Get yourself a Vulture and start bounty hunting if you want to make money. Even if you don't want to spend your life bounty hunting, the money you'll make with the Arissa bonus will be enough to let you do whatever you want. Want to explore? Spend a couple of hours bounty hunting and fully outfit yourself an A-rank Diamondback Explorer. Want to trade? Bounty hunt for a week or two and get yourself a Python. Want to pirate? A few days and you'll have a Clipper. Like bounty hunting? An FDL isn't too hard to get."

EliteDangerous,3e3vlj,Kopachris,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:38:26 2015 UTC,"What /u/ItsMangel said, or you can also increase jump range by shedding weight (modules, cargo, etc.).   Also, no you couldn't spend 6 days flying there. The way instancing works in E:D won't let you enter a new system by any means other than jumping."
EliteDangerous,3e3vlj,CMDRZoltan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:41:58 2015 UTC,"I mean, I could spend 6 days flying there.   Nope. you have to ""jump"" to get the loading screen else you just fly all the way there any nothing awaits you until you jump.  Also it will not account for the distance and you still won't be able to jump there.   I don't want to.   Good. It will make you sad.  My guess it that you put a smaller ""class"" FSD than your ship needs.  Do not add a smaller FSD to your ship! Bad things can happen."

EliteDangerous,3dzle1,brecka,2,Mon Jul 20 21:15:17 2015 UTC,"In the video, there are is hull status at ~95%, so I'd assume they can. Although, anything what I found close to 'destroying' a Capital Ship is forcing them to warp out with heavy damage. So my bet is, that when the hull reaches low enough number, they will be forced to warp out even if you don't destroy the specified heat sinks and just shell it all out at the ship."
EliteDangerous,3dzle1,CMDR_Altair_,2,Mon Jul 20 21:28:51 2015 UTC,"No they cant, in order to reroute a capital ship they have to kill all of the heat relays and from one angle you can't really get them all."

It sounds like anyone trading a certain amount of cargo is being hit with credit charges - unless they are a founder. Would explain why many of us see trade profits decline after each trip yet the demand numbers remain high.  Michael: It's a mechanism used to aid price balancing for low demand, high value goods to reduce the impact of flooding markets with those goods.  Closet_Monkey: And Founder's are exempt from this? Nice lil' perk if that is the case!  Michael: Only when trading at the founders world markets."
EliteDangerous,3e20f6,kingkeepo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:11:41 2015 UTC,"Should just lower demand on delivery, or does this happen anyway? i.e. Demand is at 5000, drop off the tonnage and demand drops to 4500 and the price changes.   Seems a bit shonky to offer at one price and buy at another. And just for the sake of nerfing the ability to exploit a resource that's being bought for a high price (i.e. what trade is all about)."

EliteDangerous,3e20f6,kingkeepo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:06:54 2015 UTC,"I read something about this awhile ago. Can't provide a link though.    Apparently the game looks at the amount of cargo you have and determines the price offered from that.    That might not be accurate, but I think it's close."
EliteDangerous,3e20f6,Mitch871,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:46:37 2015 UTC,"Ok, that sucks then. At the very least there should be a 'Cmdr, due to your large supply of cargo we can only offer you the full price for the first 200 tonnes' or something.
