ptsd,3e5ex0,smoaxzen,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:25:21 2015 UTC,Good for you for standing up for yourself. You deserve it. I have no experience in family stuff but just be careful. Make sure you have support outside if your family. pm me if you ever need an ear.
ptsd,3e3a3u,RadleyCoopSound,9,Tue Jul 21 17:00:36 2015 UTC,"So, A. I'm really sorry you're having flashbacks. My first suggestion is to just block him on fb so it doesn't ever suggest him as someone you know and you don't ever have to see his posts.   And B. Try to keep in mind that most people only post the good things about their lives on facebook. At the very least, they tend to post far more of the good than the bad. Check out this article (albeit a few years old, but still relevant I think): https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/tech-support/201204/is-everyone-happy-me  And then C: You are not weak. You not only survived a horrific experience, you've continued surviving. I know you feel weak, and that's ok and perfectly logical. But you're stronger than he is."
ptsd,3e3a3u,reasonweb,4,Tue Jul 21 17:51:55 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry you're going through this. I understand because I, too, have the same problem. But you're not weak, just like I'm not weak. And your anger at the situation is valid. Life sucks, it isn't fair, and abusers get away with things without a care in the world. They do that because they're sociopaths. They have no empathy. If they did, they wouldn't be abusing others. But you're not weak, or a loser. If you were annoying your GF she'd probably not be your GF. It's hard to hold a job when you're dealing with all the memories and flashbacks and anxiety and panic. Don't be so hard on yourself. Sometimes doing the best you can is one minute to the next, and even getting up in the morning out of bed is a win. Most people don't realize this. Please, be gentle with yourself - because your scumbag wasn't, and perhaps others aren't going to be, either. Someone has to be."
ptsd,3e3a3u,CrazyD0gLady,4,Tue Jul 21 18:04:11 2015 UTC,It takes a great amount of courage to not only tell your story but to move forward from a rape. Eight months without a flashback or incident is quite a long time and tells me that you have gone through a great amount of recovery as well as have a great amount of coping skills. That's strength not weakness. Your life will come together and your justice is moving forward and not letting what happened to you keep you stuck. You're not at square one. You just had a bad day and we're all entitled to have a bad day once in a while. It does not make one weak to have a bad day. You will survive and you will get through this.
ptsd,3e3a3u,Drabbeynormalblues,2,Tue Jul 21 17:43:48 2015 UTC,Block people on facebook that trigger you.  It will help so much in the long run.
ptsd,3e3a3u,drawsprocket,2,Tue Jul 21 22:41:42 2015 UTC,"I don't think you're weak at all, just going through a hard time. You've survived things no one should have to go through. You're doing the best you can. I think you're really strong and brave for being able to make it this far, and the fact that you went 8 months without a flashback is really, really great! You're a thousand times stronger than he'll ever be.  Your rapist is a coward who doesn't deserve what he has, and it's completely understandable that you're angry about it. But please, block him as soon as possible.   I had something similar happen where around a month ago, I would obsessively check my abuser's social media. He has a new girlfriend now, one who doesn't know about the awful things he's done to any of his exes. But looking at how successful he was and comparing him to myself wasn't helping anyone. It just made me feel sick and depressed. It took me a long time to finally resist the temptation to check in on him, but when I did, my mental health improved tenfold.  Think of your trauma as a healing wound. Every time to check in on him, you pick off the scab and start bleeding again. I know it's hard, and I understand completely, but it's for the best if you leave it alone so you can start to heal again.  You've hit a setback, but you're getting there. Don't give up yet."
ptsd,3e3a3u,throwaway53495384,2,Wed Jul 22 00:40:28 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry you feel that way. First of all, you're not weak. Having a flashback to a dramatic situation doesn't make you weak, it makes you human. Not remembering it at all would be much more worrisome although it would be much easier.   Secondly, Facebook is a bunch of lies. If somebody raped you, that person's character doesn't change. No one is going to post their dark part on Facebook. They are only going to post the best of them so everyone can think about how wonderful they are. You will rarely find truth on Facebook. It's just the Picture perfect Christmas postcard family in Internet form.  You could post pictures of your girlfriend smiling, going places, whatever and everyone will think you're a wonderful person with a happy life too. A person who rapes another person is weak. He or she may not show it outwardly, but rape is a lack of self-confidence. It says, I can't get women to like me for myself, or men, so I will rape you to get what I need or to control you.   Don't be angry at yourself for having flashbacks. How could you not? I have them too. I don't want to, I wish I didn't, I wish I could just forget everything, but I can't and I guess realistically if I did forget everything I wouldn't be who I am today in the positives. I'd like to get rid of the negatives. And it's so much easier to say this when I'm not in the midst of a flashback or being sucked back into all the negative feelings and horrible emotions.  OP you've made it this far. Don't let some asshole on Facebook drag you down."
ptsd,3e3a3u,Pippafert,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:10:05 2015 UTC,"Not weak. Not weak! His level of scumminess does not reflect on you as a person. At least you can say ""feeling"" weak, which is okay. It's okay to feel whatever, but you don't have to take it to heart as a true description of yourself. Excuse the bluntness. It's just that from an objective view, even without knowing you, nothing about this situation constitutes weakness on your part."

ptsd,3dvgmh,throwaway53495384,6,Sun Jul 19 21:27:29 2015 UTC,"IMO, you should be very thankful you caught it this young.  I've probably had C-PTSD my whole adult life and was only diagnosed at 36.  Take your treatment seriously and remove PTSD's ugly influence from your life asap.  Who knows?  You could be back to 'normal' before you enter college.  You have a very real chance to turn the road-block of PTSD into a minor speed-bump.  That's amazing!  I know it's hard as hell now, but after you work through this and start leading a functional, normal adult life, you'll be able to take advantage of every amazing opportunity that comes your way and you'll see this early diagnosis as a blessing.  I'm very hopeful for you.  You got this!"
ptsd,3dvgmh,Cthulusuppe,2,Sun Jul 19 21:48:09 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much, this honestly means so much to me. It's hard to stay optimistic about something like this, but reading this brought a smile to my face and that means the world to me these days."
ptsd,3dvgmh,skilynn,2,Sun Jul 19 22:19:28 2015 UTC,"I was diagnosed with PTSD (and four other mental illnesses) when I was fifteen. I'm twenty-one now. It never really goes away. There are still things that trigger me every now and then but for the most part I have a handle on it. High school was hell, but now I am able to go to college and live as a somewhat normal adult. So be grateful you caught it this young, so you can start getting treatment before it wrecks havoc on your adult life.   Something I think you should know, though, is that it can relapse. I went into residential treatment right before I turned eighteen and I thought I had more or less been ""cured"" of PTSD, but then relapsed when I was twenty. I wish someone had told me that it can come back. At least it wasn't as bad as it was the first time and I knew how to handle it better than before.  I suggest looking into EMDR. I moved from CBT to EMDR when I relapsed and it's helped a lot. A therapist/psychiatrist in general is great to have, but to have one who is specifically trained in treating PTSD is a blessing, especially because they have a clear understanding of how it ties into other illnesses like depression and how one can set off the other."
ptsd,3dvgmh,anonslore112,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:44:08 2015 UTC,"In my experience with PTSD from a relationship, it takes time. It's unfortunate that that's practically the slogan for all emotional pain, but in my experience (I am only 22), it's true. I was with an abusive guy from 14-18 and once I left him, had nightmares every single night for months. Gradually they slowed to a few times a week, once a week, a few times a month, and now, 4 years later, I get them every two or three months. While that might sound bad, let me assure you that all that lies ahead of you is slowly getting better. I've learned a lot about myself, about the ways what he did to me still affects me, and how to take care of myself and avoid people who have red flags reminiscent of him. Are you in therapy? It really, really helps. You can always go to a women's shelter, too - they have counseling, support groups, and education on abusive relationships. I'm always here if you want to PM me if you need to talk or want some perspective. It'll all be okay, I promise. You've just got to be patient and work at taking care of yourself."
ptsd,3dvgmh,finkeldums,2,Sun Jul 19 23:56:32 2015 UTC,"I've been in therapy ever since middle school due to a few different unrelated things (depression, anxiety, the likes). It really hurts to think about around the time I got in a relationship with him, I was finally starting to work my way through a deep depression that I've had since I was 8 or 9. I'm currently doing worse than I ever was mentally. I only opened up to my therapist about what happened a few weeks ago (around 1 year after the relationship ended), which is when I got tested for PTSD.  Unfortunately, I live in the middle of nowhere, and the closest women's shelter is over an hour away. Even my therapist takes around 30-40 minutes to drive to.   Thank you so much for your support, this means a lot to me."

This hit really close to home because I've been struggling with major depression, too, along with what seems like every disorder in the book (with PTSD, I've managed to rack up 5 different diagnoses).   I really do hope things get better for you, too. It's hard to deal with mental illness and even harder to do so without therapy, so the fact that you've made it this far is pretty spectacular. I wish you the best. :)"
ptsd,3dvgmh,day_break,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:35:14 2015 UTC,"IMO, the earlier you catch it the better. I was diagnosed at 7, and while it was tough and confusing as a child, I was able to get a relatively good handle on it before it could get a chance to destroy my adult life. It's never stopped hurting, but eventually you can acclimate to it, and really learn how to manage all of the shit that it throws your way.

ptsd,3dvgmh,Wolf_Craft,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:49:17 2015 UTC,"As far as the person who said you are lucky to have caught your diagnosis this young, I feel like a dick for saying this but I totally agree. You don't need to be doing what your friends are doing or dating right now. I know that response sucks, but if this had happened to you at 24 it could be totally debilitating. Its actually better for teenagers to be not out making out and partying. You've got years to make out and party. You don't want to see what PTSD can turn into when making out and partying is old news. You could accidentally get yourself into situations that will make your PTSD worse. The last 4 years of my life have gone by in a very quick blur of dissatisfied drinking myself sick. I've not accomplished much in the mean time. I'm now 24 in a small debt hole with no degree. All of my friends who didn't party as teens have visited other countries, earned college degrees, work actual careers and are beginning to buy homes. I have to excuse myself to the bathroom to hide in the bathroom too, but it happens at work and it has now cost me 4 jobs.  Not to downplay the horror you are feeling in running out. I know it well, you're terrified, embarrassed, and wishing you would just die already so it would be over. I know the feeling well. Just trust me, its much worse when its your workplace and literally no one gives a fuck that you're actually suffering, they're just over your shit.   Find a good therapist if you don't have one. One you can really talk too. I hope, hope you have insurance. Spend the next few years processing your trauma and exercising your breathing/mindfulness. Maybe take up yoga. Homeschool if you need too. You can still go to college, even if you need to take a break. Get your homework done. Keep in touch with us here at r/PTSD, you're not alone. You're just young enough to be able to take the time to tackle this without derailing your future.

I went to meet some family members for a coffee a couple of days ago, and the noise in the cafe was excruciating : clattering cups and saucers, espresso machines, twenty different conversations all coming at me at the same volume, echoing off the walls, screaming kids, jumping at everyone that went by and the reflections of passing cars, and trying to keep up with a conversation. I would have run out of there, but it was the first time I'd seen my family in ages and didn't want my PTSD to intrude on them. But god it was painful.  How long has it been for you? A year and a half for me. I was speaking to somebody on here who said it was six years for him. I can't imagine that. I still keep thinking that I'll finally get some treatment and it will go.   I can't believe you have to deal with idiots like that room-mate's friend. That made me so angry just reading it.  Take care of yourself."
ptsd,3dtjog,JustBeeNice,2,Sun Jul 19 14:24:20 2015 UTC,Its been about 4-5 years for me. I thought it was an anxiety disorder growing up but then a psychiatrist told me it was more severe than that. Its so hard. Later last night my roommate came home really drunk and kept cornering me and I kept trying to get away but he kept pushing me back. I know he was just drunk and joking around but he's like 6'2 and I'm a 5'4 female. My ptsd stems from childhood abuse so I was absolutely terrified. After I got away I ran up to my room and locked the door but couldn't breathe I was so scared. I stayed up all night scared to fall asleep.

Try not to dwell on it, and if you're having a hard time with that try to refocus that energy on something more worthwhile, like the opinions of people who actually are worthy of respect.

Many people with ptsd and trauma-related major depression deal with the same problem. There is no need to doubt you'd memories. The way you remember things is what matters, as that is the weight you carry. Dreams are the tool of your brain to process memories. Trauma sufferers often have nightmares as the brain tries to cope with trauma. If you are reliving experiences of abuse too frequently, you may consider seeing an MD and a psychotherapist to help you cope with your traumatic experiences. The road is hard, painful, but possible, and moreover, worthy. It may take seeing different therapists/MDs but it is achievable. Strength and if you want to chat more, msg me."

Usually I get those in times of high stress or if my flashbacks during the day were particularly bad and maybe it brings in the flashback + things I experienced or saw during the day.

There are psychiatrists who do therapy, but few are covered by universal healthcare, and the ones who are have long waiting lists. The ones who aren't covered charge around $300/hr. Psychologists are almost exclusively not covered by universal healthcare. Some medical benefits plans cover seeing one, but only a limited number of times (buy coverage or employer benefits...

ptsd,3drjgo,kaylwatters24,5,Sat Jul 18 19:38:17 2015 UTC,"I went through most of it but had to stop.  It was filled with obvious inductive baiting errors that are obviously going to be used for the soul purpose of playing around the false attribution error, and playing it off as direct science.  It couldn't have been more obvious.  Let me clue you in on something.  It's called Epistemology.  You can't use multiple fallacies, stack them on each other, use cherry picking, and then claim you just did science.  Here is a list of obvious fallacies that are present in these kinds of surveys:  Cherry picking fallacy  False dilemma fallacy  Attribution error  Conflation fallacy  Correlation equals causation fallacy <- Extreme common in your field  Confirmation bias  Etc.  It's anti-intellectual abuses like this that actually caused my C-PTSD. I was misdiagnosed with multiple mental illnesses when I was perfectly healthy. This occurred because everyone around me was competitive and persistently used logical fallacies and biases in order to falsely accuse me and dominate me. I grew up in a super conservative and religious area that demanded conformity, even if you were already conforming. Bullying and false accusations were common, and authorities scapegoated, and stuck to the same scapegoats, as even told people this was their ""role"" in life. Then they cycled in ""the argument from ignorance."" Before I knew it I was segregated and being forced to take stimulants and sedatives because I was a skeptic or didn't believe I had to obey others or respect hierarchical abuse. I believed in freedom to correct errors and freedom from punishments if they were being delt under false premises.  But one can only be segregated, abuse, drugged and treated disrespectfully and oppressively for so long. Eventually testing (after decades) PROVED I didn't have those illnesses, but my life was completely destroyed, and every single therapist and social workers I talked to just cycled in stereotyping, narcissistic abuse, and tried to make cash grabs while fostering dependence. They were obsessed with trying to stereotype and grab statistics, and even pressured me to lie in order to reach the conclusions they were seeking. I've got audio recording to prove that.  Please, for the sake of logic and science, look up epistemology, logical fallacies and biases. Please. Accuracy matters."

I am fluent in both current scientific and epistemological understandings. My criticisms are completely rational and fair, but looking at your post it does not seem that you you are familiar with the epistemological errors inherent in all surveys. Cherry picking fallacies, inductive fallacies and correlation fallacies are all one can actually derive from surveys. That's not a personal opinion, but something the scientific community has pointed out again and again. I am going to ignore the belittling tone of your comment since anti-epistemological belittlement is a serious trigger for me. If other people are not caught up on epistemology and scientific standards, it's not for me to internalize nor feel bad about."
ptsd,3drjgo,cdooginz,0,Wed Jul 22 03:32:03 2015 UTC,"I responded to another comment in a similiar way, but yes, in terms of epistemology, the questions that I selected for the survey (and again, I did NOT write these questions; others researchers have constructed the self-report questions and validated the measures. In social science, you don't get to add your own self-generated questions into a survey and pass them off as measuring a phenomenon without going through a statistical validation process) do heavily incorporate Christian language and themes. The authors of these questions do not necessarily have a Christian agenda, but they make a fairly educated guess about their sample demographics; their chances of getting significant results increase if their sample (predominantly Christian, at least in the US) understands and relates to the questions. I am not going to deny that many of these questions are irrelevant or not applicable to other religious faiths or atheists. That's a clear limitation; all researchers in this field know and recognize that.   As for your crash lesson on epistemology, this IS a correlational study, and cannot attribute causation. The analyses I can use for this study DO NOT lend themselves to cause and effect conclusions. And I would never try to imply that A causes B. As you suggest, the field is inundated with correlational studies. And self-report, correlational research continues to exist, even when people like yourself point out all the epistemological flaws inherent to it. Here is my personal belief: Pure, unadulterated objectivity in science does not exist. All science (even the ""hard"" sciences which most people believe convey the ""real"" truth) make their own assumptions about how knowledge should be obtained and interpreted. They have flaws too. Unfortunately, for social scientists, it's much easier for people to criticize our methods, but just remember, we're studying human beings, not rocks. So the questions scientists ask, the language that they use, how they understand trauma or growth or religion or whatever, is always inextricably linked and filtered through the scientist's culture, worldviews, and personal biases. There is no possible way to escape it. So we do need people, like yourself, to help make us aware of our blindspots. This is why quality research is peer-reviewed, but that's another discussion.  It is important to return to and critically examine the epistemological flaws. Social scientists in training, like myself, are very tentative in our writing. We use hypothetical langauge. We do not make declarative statements. I'm not trying to arrive at truth, make a grandiose statement, or promote a religious agenda. I am trying to collect empirical evidence to test part of well-known theory in positive psychology, which of course encompasses Western concepts built upon a Western foundation of knowledge.  So no. My self-report study cannot accurately represent or characterize your experience. We would need a qualitative study in order to understand how dominant epistemological norms traumatize people, as you anecedotally testify. If this study comes to fruition, the epistemological concerns will be discussed."

I certainly agree that the problem with the measures is a valid concern, but unfortunately, it is one of the limitations that I have to work with.   If I wanted to bias my sample, I would only recruit from Christian sources. But that seems problematic to me. Some of religious questions that people are expressing dissent over are NOT even the main variables of interest.  I am more interested in spirituality (trait spirituality) and need the religious items for comparison. That's where the Christian language comes in."

I'm guessing what you're really trying to get at is what type of recovery and growth has happened after the trauma, but the way the question is worded makes it sound like asking how the trauma has made me grow and change.  Well the trauma just about killed me.  I was worn down to a nub of a human being and after years of intense effort, intense therapy (worth thousands of dollars) and choosing a life path that could support recovery (i.e., not going to medical school); I have gained a lot of wisdom, strength and other gifts that I am now grateful for.

In terms of ""growth"" people often report things that you have mentioned, like wisdom, strength, and other gifts (like increased compassion for others), but they still say that they wish the event had never had happened. That is, they question how the growth can be worth the emotional pain and hardship. It seems like an incredibly difficult question to wrestle with, and it raises important consideration about what growth means. I appreciate your sharing and checking out the survey"
ptsd,3drjgo,wheneverrichardcory,2,Sun Jul 19 04:16:41 2015 UTC,"I finished it, but almost regret doing so.  Why so religious? I thought this was a scientific based survey for a university? The survey said that the universe was aware of the study, but are they aware of the exact subject matter? I honestly cannot see any credible university approving something as biased as this.   Many of the questions were phrased in such a way that only a religious person could answer them. Many of the questions were phrased in such a way that it seemed you were suggesting people who aren't religious are wrong. It was also very clearly written by and looking for answers from christians. Again, very biased.   I think you should seriously about the morality behind this. I can tell just from your questions that you are christian and believe that your beliefs would help people who suffer from trauma to recover. Your church has a very big problem with clergy sexually assaulting young people, and covering it up so that clergy will avoid the legal consequences they deserve. Your book of worship very specifically advocates rape, slavery, use of women and children as property to be traded or used sexually, and calls for the murder of non-christians. It is a very hateful faith that outputs a message of acceptance, but that acceptance is only for those who believe."

I know the questions are biased and and directed towards Christians. These questions have little to do with my personal beliefs. I did not write the questions. The self-report instruments are what people in this research area have used to operationalize religious constructs, and they do tend to align to Christian worldviews. I recognize that limitation, the entire field recognizes that limitation, and we need more people to develop instruments that are more inclusive of diverse faiths. I included a non-denominational spirituality to differentiate religion from spirituality, but as you might imagine, it's very difficult to measure spirituality. Is it amoral for me to conduct this study? Well, the purpose of this study is not to ascribe positive or negative valence to religion or spirituality. The theory suggests that religion and spirituality may influence growth, so scientists need to test the hypothesis and see if there's evidence to support the theory. That's really the purpose of the study, and I doubt that the Church reads scientific journals."

So this study uses a measure that operationalizes spirituality as a search for the transcendental and connection with something larger than oneself. That measures has been used with many diverse faiths (other than Christians), and it aims to be non-demonimational. The religiosity questions do contain Christian language and themes. I do take that limitation into account, and I am not trying to fit everyone into a Christian box. We think of religion as an organizational or institutional framework that encompasses certain beliefs and behaviors. I think if one believes in God and practices religious behaviors, the questions do have personal relevance.  I'm actually trying to separate spirituality and religion in this study. Spirituality may be a more univeral phenomenon than religion. I do not know what spirituality means to you personally, but I included the spirituality measure for inclusivity. I hope that helps answer your question."

I'd say your best bet is to find a therapist and talk out whatever the issues you may not be allowing yourself to see. As traumatic as the original head injury was, I'd have to imagine the very fact of being in a coma for two weeks had at least as profound an impact on you. (for instance, the awareness that during those 2 weeks you had zero control over your own body, let alone control over your life... or ability to be alive, were it not for medical intervention).   As the date rolls around, you're apprehensive about it, and your reaction/aversion to it probably means you behave differently (doing things like causing relationships to end). It happens once, you correlate the two things, and now you've got a feedback loop reinforcing itself.   Anniversaries mean nothing to our bodies, and certainly mean nothing to the universe. It's just another day, like any other. Our minds, however, turn a date into an anniversary-- some people turn anniversaries into something even more. Looks like you're one of them.  Best of luck!"

I think a lot of the people/books/specialists have a tendency to leave out the bit about how hard it is to recover. The brain is amazing in that it is POSSIBLE to recover but it certainly doesn't make it easy on us, does it?   I really think that by amazing, they simply mean that it's possible. It would certainly be worse if we couldn't recover at all and were constantly stuck in this circular repetition of the trauma in our brains.   None of this is meant to diminish your frustration.

If the brain is so resilient and it's so easy to fix then that exempts them from doing any hard work or having any obligations to help and move hell an high water to change the world that keeps traumatizing people and keeps traumatized people stuck in trauma.

I don't know if that makes sense or not, but I thought I would share it as a way to support your awesome breakthrough today.  Enjoy this weekend! Best wishes for better days ahead."

I've found, in my personal experiences at least, that when you're experiencing constant trauma for extended periods of time that you begin to acclimate to it, it almost feels normal. Once you're out of danger and safe, it can take a lot of time and work before your new environment feels right.   I struggled with this for a long time in my own way, my entire sense of self worth and ego were based on this almost weird form of Survivor's Guilt. I had this idea that after surviving over a decade of practically daily abuse, any adversity that came my way should be trivial to me in comparison. I would fall apart whenever I actually failed at something or had a PTSD breakdown, it would crash my ego and self worth right off a cliff. To make myself feel good again, I'd go looking for excitement or adversity, just to reclaim my ego and self worth.  In my opinion, which is admittedly not professional, and founded solely on observations of my own psychology, you haven't acclimated to being in a safe environment yet. You're still on the lookout for danger, and when you can't find any, you go out looking for it. Your ego and sense of self worth are too entwined with adversity for you to not crave it. If nothing else, seek professional help. Stay strong, PM me if you ever want to talk."

ptsd,3dkvu7,stuartwolf,5,Fri Jul 17 02:27:23 2015 UTC,I agree with drabbey... ( why do you have such a difficult username? 😃) What might be mildly dramatic for one person may be seriously traumatic for another. PTSD can be formed on one experience for many. The bottom line is that it's probably worth talking about with someone who is a medical professional who understands the issues. It doesn't matter if she's PTSD or anxiety ridden or just traumatized from this experience. Everyone has  Traumatic experiences which can stay with them with them for a long time. If they are really bad they are worth talking about with the professional who can understand.

I've got all kinds of weird ""phobias"" that I shouldn't have because of how my dad was.  My advice to you is to just know that your friend went through some ridiculous shit as a kid and don't dismiss anything she says as though it can't possibly be that bad.

You did not experience what she did, you are not in her head. If she says it was and is difficult and traumatic, it was and is. That is the end of the story.

I guess when I think about it that way I can understand why it does not maybe seen traumatic but to me the immobilization and physical handling it would take to force someone into this kind of punishment is what felt horrible.

I didn't think dog breath is bad enough to do that, is it?  As for how she was forced to - her father definitely would have put her in a forced hold if needed, he told her that and she certainly believed it, but he gave her the option to do it willingly instead, and she did, to avoid the force-hold.

ptsd,3dkvu7,asndsnss,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:49:28 2015 UTC,"I agree with lynxnloki, although a bit more gently. For some people, scents or odors are very triggering.  I cannot smell something that is associated with the person I used to know without having a flashback directly to that time. It's not always a bad flashback but it is a flashback. If someone walks in to a room wearing the perfume my mother used to wear, I am immediately sad. It takes me back to when she was alive.   Everyone is different and everyone is sensitive to different triggers. You may not understand this but I believe it can definitely be true for some people. The best I can tell you is if she believes it's true or if she feels this way when she experiences this thing, if you want to be a friend, recognize it for what it is and don't question it. Just support her when she feels horrible. There are so many things that don't make sense for people with PTSD to try to explain to people who haven't experienced it. You sound like you're a caring friend who's just puzzled by a very different situation. Try to imagine yourself in a position where you had no choice other than to do what you were told to do even if it were horrible to you. You would  probably have something, whether it was sense or smell or touch or hearing that would flash you back to that experience. I'm glad that you're a good enough friend to reach out and try to understand what's going on."
ptsd,3dkvu7,Wolf_Craft,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:13:55 2015 UTC,My sense is that she had a lot of feelings like fear of what further punishments she may receive or she may not be telling you the whole story of just how bad the punishments got. It's not your place to judge how she feels or the severity of it. What may be highly traumatic for me may not be anything to you. It also takes one time for something to give someone PTSD. If this bothers her i'd suggest seeing a therapist. It definitely does sound like dogs are a trigger for her and therapy would help her past that.
ptsd,3dkcxd,cryslea,3,Thu Jul 16 23:41:36 2015 UTC,"Do it. University professor here, with complex PTSD experience. It's not going to hurt you to ask for the accommodation. You don't have to use it but you've got it if you need it. You don't have to request anything right now, you just need to have the note from the disability office that tells your professor you may make requests and that your professor should accommodate those. Rarely does it say exactly what requests you will make. Personally I think it's always better to have a choice than no choice. You may find that PTSD makes no difference in your class experience and you may find that there is a trigger. It's worth having that already in place before you go to class.  A good professor is in tune with his or her students. If you're using it as an excuse to not go to class, a good professor will recognize that versus a hard-working student who sometimes doesn't appear in class and has a legitimate reason. My experience has been that disability offices do not give really specific accommodations, at least not like they do in K-12. They simply give a notification that this person may need accommodations and that you as a professor must recognize this. Every school is different and my school was a state school so maybe that made the circumstances different than other schools."

There's no disrespect meant here to community college teachers, it's just a different situation.   They may understand, they may not but if you talk to them ahead of time they probably won't care. Especially at graduate-level, as long as you show you're  a serious student who meets deadlines, puts in as much as you can and is really engaged. Good luck!

Instead, I'd approach the prof if I know that topic is coming up, or send an email after a class and let them know why I didn't participate that day.  If your university's disability office offers extended exams that's always nice to utilize.

It doesn't create problems, but it'll exacerbate them... it's not that you don't have a problem when sober, but do when you're drunk-- you've always got a problem, it just becomes evident when you're drunk. Stopping drinking is a good thing-- it's not a solution, it won't fix anything--but it does give you the clarity of mind (and your brain the ability not to have tons of its cells killed off prematurely) to work on stuff.  Whether it's PTSD, or just issues--get some help. I know some people have advocated medical marijuana for PTSD patients, and if a licensed professional seems to think that might help you control the symptoms (symptoms... worth repeating), cool. Otherwise? self-medication is more likely to make things worse and ingrain destructive behavior patterns.   It sounds like you've got some emotional numbing (when sober) that erupts in emotional explosions (when drunk). The problem is always there, and that's your line in with getting yourself the right kind of help."

I highly suggest seeing some sort of therapist/psychologist/support group.   I want to second /u/thepuncroc about the emotional numbing thing. It sounds like you stuffed all of your emotions down inside yourself just to get through the ordeal. And now that it's passed, you haven't worked through them and they come out when your inhibitions are lessened by the alcohol. My recommendation is to avoid the alcohol until you can work through the emotions with a licensed professional."
ptsd,3djl7g,Pippafert,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:07:36 2015 UTC,"PTSD does not have to happen from repeated exposure to traumatic events. It can be one event or it can be 100 events. Each person deals with traumatic events differently. This is your best friend and your roommate. You were worried about this person's health and you were dealing with being under suspicion for this person's condition. Either of those could lead to PTSD, or high anxiety, or any other emotional condition.  I do agree that alcohol can make things worse, and probably does. I also have spent my own share of time self-medicating with alcohol. It could be that the alcohol is releasing the controls you keep on your emotions every day. Or, it could be exacerbating it.   I'm not a professional, but I think there  probably is an issue.  It would be unusual if you didn't have one after the stress and difficulties that you faced.  I think there's a valid reason for having an issue. That doesn't mean drinking doesn't create a bigger issue at times, but you went through very difficult time which was very emotionally draining.  Help doesn't mean that you're messed up. Help means you're asking for somebody who has more coping skills than you do in this particular situation. It cannot hurt. It might not help but generally if you have a good professional to talk to you it's not gonna hurt. I think it's worth checking out. You might find it's not helpful and then you can leave.

I had a very bad experience with someone last year without they could treat anyone regardless of the specialization. That was not true. If you have someone who feels they can recommend you to someone who can treat you better, that is fantastic. And even if this person is fully booked here she might be able to recommend you to somebody who is equally as the specialized.   I'm not crazy about the "" i'm doing your therapist a favor ""but if he or she can recommend somebody who is equally as skilled in trauma as this PhD is that that's a good start. And honestly, someone who doesn't feel  like they are owing a favor, might be  less pressured and more open. I wish my last therapist had been able to say he couldn't treat my issues and suggest someone who could. But he was to egocentric for that. He thought that he could diagnose everything within his frame of reference and it was either right or wrong. The wrong would've been how I felt about it, the right would've been his own opinion. It's a really terrible position at the end so I think you're very lucky to have someone who recognizes that somebody with more experience in your issues could be more helpful, even if it's not this PhD.

You may identify with that one part, but I think you're missing the big picture. We are very much broken, traumatized, unwhole, different. In fact, denial of those things makes PTSD worse, makes us feel hopeless and ostracized. PTSD was around for a long time before it was called PTSD - it wasn't just cooked up by ""the authority"".

Sincerely, I intend to help, if only by showing that there is a different way to think about this separation, one that doesn't necessarily involve taking on the identity of someone with a condition, a disorder, or a mental illness. I don't mean to dissuade anyone from getting counseling if they feel they need it, but from reading posts and comments here, and other information about PTSD, it seems those with the diagnosis face being labeled as broken, traumatized, and unwhole. When an authority does it, like a psychologist, we tend to take their word for it and adopt that identity without question. When the media perpetuates it, it becomes a majority opinion. There's another way to look at yourself after you've gone through something others haven't, and we seem to be stuck in this limited way of thinking about it."

The problem comes with the rest of the world assuming that we are lesser because of those labels. We aren't. I didn't adopt another identity when I was given a PTSD diagnosis, it was descriptive, not prescriptive. It simply described who I already was and gave me a path to being a healthier person. If you want to help things, and I think you do, you're going about it wrong. Help us change the perception of the rest of the world that the labels are a bad thing.

ptsd,3dgebd,bunnybearlover,2,Thu Jul 16 05:52:37 2015 UTC,"Prazosin has helped me a lot. The only problem is that even on a small dosage I have sleep paralysis. I just can't wake up. It's not even just tired, my eyes literally won't open. When I have to be somewhere early I can't take it. Like tonight, it's almost 3am and I'm afraid to sleep. Can't win.. It works though."
ptsd,3dgebd,Cthulusuppe,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:39:18 2015 UTC,"I have been using prazosin.  There's a chance that the day after your first use your blood pressure will drop and you'll feel faint or pass out.  I took my BP while this was happening and it was 79/54 which is quite low for me.  My normal range is typically ~124/82 and my range while on my anti-depressant (effexor) is hypertensive (>140/90).  So, be prepared for that...  Your body gets used to the prazosin fairly quickly, so you shouldn't experience BP drops like that after the first dose (unless you increase the dosage), but if you don't expect it, it can be scary.  You can dodge most of the low-BP by taking prazosin before you go to sleep and sleep a full night.  Effexor has been causing me insomnia (3 hours sleep per night), so that's probably why I experienced the extremely low BP-- I got up too early.    Unfortunately, I don't know much about Zoloft.  I'd advise keeping a journal of your side-effects as you experience them, at least for the first few days.  It sounds like you've already been on a low dosage, so you should know what to expect."

And did it ever occur to you that a military psychologist might actually have pressure on them to not diagnose PTSD precisely because it means a person could get benefits?? If that happened, then he was traumatized by his military experience, is being betrayed & humiliated by his family, and was betrayed by a therapist who was supposed do right by him.

ptsd,3de4an,BlueCatIsFat,8,Thu Jul 16 01:12:08 2015 UTC,"I was about to mention mst-- if he suffered an assault or threat of assault while serving, deployed or not-- it would compound his trauma and he would have not just symptoms of ptsd but c-ptsd. Unfortunately a lot of survivors of childhood sexual abuse gravitate to military service because they think they will empowered to make themselves safer. I personally think he sounds like he's legit suffering, just doesn't have the kind of trauma that he can really talk about, plus the shame and stigma of sexual abuse and mst are deranging.  tldr love him the best you can. I don't think he is hurting people who suffered from more valorized forms of trauma."
ptsd,3de4an,reasonweb,8,Wed Jul 15 17:07:51 2015 UTC,"The fact that you're aware that he's experienced trauma and yet are unwillingly to accept that he might have PTSD strikes me as contradictory. What difference does it make whether his PTSD comes from the sexual abuse or his military service? He still served his country and deserves whatever support the VA and the country can give him. I have to be honest, you sound like you're feeling left out because he's getting special treatment and you aren't."
ptsd,3de4an,bunnybearlover,7,Wed Jul 15 18:49:39 2015 UTC,"Traumas actually compound ""on top"" of one another creating layers. People who go to war with zero baggage have major PTSD issues. Your bro has the past abuse PLUS the war.  I would give him the benefit of the doubt. I'm sure it is way easier for him to ""blame"" his war experience than explain his other issues."
ptsd,3de4an,reasonweb,6,Wed Jul 15 22:45:54 2015 UTC,"If you were not aware one can have PTSD from sexual abuse especially as a child, children who experience abuse have a 50% chance of having PTSD. It may not have been caused by the military but it still is a big possibility he does have it either way due to just that alone. I would imagine there's a difference that victims of abuse focus on. Males are not taken as seriously when it comes to sexual abuse so it would be no surprise to me that he would rather say it was the military that caused it. It's a possibility he DOES have it but wants it so badly to be the military that caused it, sexual abuse brings on feelings of shame and disgust, worthlessness, etc, powerless. The way he's going on about it sounds to me like he's trying to come off as 'macho' and 'badass', to the point where it's clearly forced. It's like he's trying to seek validation but by not focusing on the actual issue it's not going to help him at all with recovery.   Edit: I agree with you that if he has PTSD it's not from the military, a big staple of ptsd is avoidance and not wanting to be reminded of your trauma. If he were traumatized from the military he would not be obsessed with guns and talking so often about it, but I DO think he is showing signs of avoidance about the sexual abuse through being obsessed with the military being the cause of it and ignoring the actual root of the problem."
ptsd,3de4an,land_of_animals,2,Thu Jul 16 01:17:21 2015 UTC,"The whole thing could be from that trauma. I've been diagnosed with PTSD from at least 3 doctors and since it's not combat related most people look at me like I'm making it up somehow. Him saying it's military related could just be to avoid that. Especially when men especially have a hard time confronting sexual abuse. This is his way of dealing with it.   Also, my nightmares are almost all about violence and people being murdered all around me. It has nothing to do with when I was attacked. It's just fear."
ptsd,3de4an,wheneverrichardcory,3,Wed Jul 15 18:12:26 2015 UTC,"Do you think he may have PTSD, but maybe some other disorders/problems as well? It is hard to say if people are ""faking"" PTSD, and if they are, it sometimes is evidence of other, underlying problems.  What I'm asking I guess is: do you think he is only lying for benefits? Or may he have other problems too? Because if it is the latter, it may be good for him to get those benefits, just for a time, so he can work on his problems, PTSD related or not."
ptsd,3de4an,Pixiepup,-3,Wed Jul 15 21:26:37 2015 UTC,I don't think he wants to get well. There's a story in the bible where Jesus asks a man who is sick if he wants to get well.  It seems kind of silly to ask someone if they want to get better.  Of course we want to get better...  Right?  Wrong.  Some people want to wallow in it and that's what I feel is going on with my brother.

It's triggering me BIG TIME and this kind of anger is exactly what I don't need in my effort to get myself better. But there are people in my life who would witness my anger right now & tell me that I'm ""wallowing"" or ""choosing to be angry"" and victim-blame me and point to this as evidence that I don't want to be better.  I also spend a lot of time on reddit in supportive subs talking about mental illness because it's therapeutic. But there are people in my life who would call it wallowing... and ""why don't you just get over it?""  I even have family that believe talking to a therapist is wallowing!!  I actively participate in NAMI and I spread awarenes on my facebook, and I help do political activism for mental health issues because it matters & it's important. I am sure there are assholes on my facebook who think I'm doing it as a self-serving attention-seeking thing.  Clearly your brother upsets you because he makes you feel defensive about your own PTSD, so right or wrong, it seems like you should stay away from him for your sake.  But also, what you don't seem to recognize is that your shitty egocentric attitude about HIS mental health is really toxic to HIM, so you should cut ties for his sake, too.  And now I need to log off Reddit because my adrenaline level is through the fucking roof right now."

I'll chime in with my two cents, but keep in mind this is only my personal opinion and that I am only a dude who's not even anywhere near his degree in therapy yet.  This doesn't sound like PTSD. It sounds like you are just severely depressed and stressed out by this situation. PTSD is more than crying over something once a month. There's a lot more going on that makes it that.   You're fighting through the grief of losing your friend and I'll bet you're still shocked given the circumstance.   As soon as you can, find a therapist. Have them get you in touch with a psychiatrist so you can properly get a diagnosis.  But PTSD just doesn't sound like it's in your ballpark. Now don't go off convincing yourself that you do have PTSD. It's not something you want to deal with, and self-diagnosing yourself will only create more problems as you will mentally set yourself up to feel like you have PTSD, and it makes recovery far harder than it needs to be."

Do you find less triggers at the restaurant that you do in other places? If you do then maybe it's a safe place. If not then you should try your field of study.

I've had that happen before. My manager has been great when I get anxiety. We go outside and we work on my coping skills. Doctors can't do that. They don't have time for that.

You've achieved a lot for yourself at a young age. There are probably some doctors' offices which have lower risk factors for triggers than others. Just thinking out loud here, but a dermatologist for example may have less likely good of being exposed to domestic violence bruises than an internist (not that domestic violence doesn't happen across all genders, ages, and socioeconomic levels). You might want to try a couple of interviews and see how you feel about the doctor him/herself and how stressed you feel. You are under no obligations to TAKE a job that's offered to you, and you're not really wasting anyone's time because you are unsure.   Waitressing may seem less professional but it's just a facade. I've met servers who are true professionals, dedicated to their job and to excellent customer services, more so than I've met in professional offices. And I've met those for whom it's a summer job. Speaking from my own experiences, especially at your age, I couldn't wait to get a ""real"" job. Some of my corporate experiences were far worse than the other ""non-professional"" jobs I had.

But all the research is showing that talking about the trauma as much as possible with people you trust.  Is one of the best ways to avoid it becoming a long term chronic PTSD problem.

ptsd,3d75uu,arkitekt47,2,Tue Jul 14 01:25:21 2015 UTC,"You are doing it wrong in two ways.    Stopping SSRIs suddenly is not smart, it will cause a reaction.  Doctors recommend a rate of reduction that is fine for most people.  Some people find it much too fast though and can get ongoing problems, so it is safer to go slower.   You can use a razor to cut pills up, or switch to a liquid form.    Paxil / paroxetine is the hardest SSRI to come off, while Prozac is the easiest.  I guess because paroxetine is the shortest acting and Prozac the longest.   If you are having problems coming off paroxetine it may be wise to gradually switch to Prozac over a week or two, then come off the Prozac at the normal rate.    A very common mistake with antidepressants (and antibiotics) is to stop taking them after you feel better.  But you are still depressed, which you experience as a bad reaction during taper off, except that it continues.   You need to keep taking AD meds until your depression is fixed, not just until you feel better."

ptsd,3d2ela,ThrowAway_PTSD_,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:50:17 2015 UTC,"Pelvic exams are horrifying. I tense up so much, involuntarily, that it just hurts more. I cover my eyes with one hand and clutch my stomach or the side of the table with my other. I feel sick through the whole thing. I empathize there completely. The easiest time I've had is when I've had doctors who understand my anxiety and warn me before every touch and then make small talk about completely unrelated things, but don't expect an answer. Quicker is better.  It sounds like you've been through a pretty awful ordeal and I don't know that I have advice but I wanted to let you know that there's at least one other woman out there who feels the same way. I'm so sorry."

I was in a less serious accident (no injuries even) in 2007, but I still have moments of complete paranoia that someone's coming into my lane, etc. All those freaky things you can never really prepare for.   It should get better with time, but that doesn't help you now. Have you heard of EMDR therapy? It may work for you - I read a really interesting book on it called Emotional Healing At Warp Speed. Good luck."

The reaction is so physical, anf I think its largely because I ended up in the hospital with a pretty crazy injury. One if the most traumatic things from that day was being rushed to the hospital. Even thinking about it makes my head swim a bit.  I've seen mention of EMDR in this sub, but honestly I have no idea what it entails. Have you done it? Do you mind briefly explaining it to me?"
ptsd,3d0nns,hulahulagirl,2,Mon Jul 13 02:36:39 2015 UTC,"I haven't done EMDR, but I was researching it for my husband. It's processing trauma by using right/left movements in your body (usually eyes, but sometimes hands, feet). I know it sounds kooky but the book was very interesting. Google it for a better explanation than I gave. :)"

ptsd,3cyvc1,LivingInFearPTSDgirl,3,Sun Jul 12 00:59:59 2015 UTC,"When I first started seeing my therapist and we started talking about some of the things that caused my PTSD, I had the same reactions you've mentioned such as the nightmares, flashbacks, freezing in public places, and feeling like everything was happening all over again. It was hard, at first, for me to decide to keep talking about it because it seemed like talking about it just made it worse. It took a lot of time and don't get me wrong, I still have my bad moments, but I was able to learn how to cope with the freezing, flashbacks, etc. One thing was therapist told me was to repeat the phrase, ""These are just memories. They cannot hurt me."" over and over again until I started to calm down. As silly as it sounds, repeating that phrase did help. Maybe it can help you too. I sincerely wish you the best. You sound like an incredibly strong person and you don't deserve to be going through any of this. Strength and best wishes coming your way!"

ptsd,3cyvc1,ElectraNightshade,2,Tue Jul 14 19:51:10 2015 UTC,"hugs That sounds horrible. Have you tried any mindfulness techniques? I was told that whenever my thoughts start getting out of control, to audibly say the word 'stop', and then name all the things I can see around me. This both helps to distract my brain, and grounds me in what's happening physically around me. You can keep on naming things as long as you need to until you're no longer troubled by the thoughts. It might only work for a minute at first, but the more you do it, the longer it seems to work for. I sometimes do it silently in my head when I'm in company, which also works, but it's more affective when I can hear myself saying it out loud.  I hope these experiences stop for you as soon as possible!"

ptsd,3cyvc1,cyathea,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:37:48 2015 UTC,No i dont really have that. In my country we have universal health care and that includes psych things but they are clueless about PTSD things. Mine comes from childhood things and honestly the best support emotionally I can find is here on Reddit on RBN sub.. I don't have a life partner because it is hard to find somebody who have seen the same things or similar and who knows how it is to grow up without what society assumes you do.  Reading and posting here helps a lot if only just knowing others out there feel the same. I would have killed myself years ago if not for a few very good friends.  Most of my childhood peers of abusive homes are dead by their own hands or slowly dying of drugs. Whenever I srsly contemplate ending it I see one of their faces and it I stop but it just hurts even more.

Not much you can do because the justice system is kind of shit.  Do you know if he's getting info on your whereabouts from one of your friends, or has otherwise found some place where he can find your comings and goings? Are friends mentioning they're with you at places, or tagging you on their check-ins? Could he have a keylogger or something on your computer or phone, or does he just know your routine?  I'm so sorry this is happening to you btw. This guy is obviously looking to intimidate while avoiding anything you can report. I would still talk to the police though, and ask them about anything you can do.  If it's possible I'd switch up my routine in places I could (knowing this isn't always possible ie work), try to be with other people all the time, and look very hard at possible sumbitches leaking your wherebouts.

The other day I went shopping for an upcoming wedding, I didn't tell anyone where I was....when I was on my way home, he kept driving by the train station I was at....when I got the bus, I got off a stop before the one I usually do and sure enough, he drove down the side street I live near when the bus stopped at my usual stop.

ptsd,3cv8h8,hurl3y,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:15:32 2015 UTC,"Do a full restore on your phone. Download avast! So you won't get viruses or anybody hacking into it. Cover your webcams on both your phone and laptop. ALWAYS have 2 factor authentication turned on for everything possible. And change your passwords. You have a restraining order against him, that protects you from him stalking you online as well. You can also download trackers for your social media accounts where you can see who is visiting your pages. Use LONG ASS pass phrases like ""1*39TheCatAteChickenSoup1927&$#"" (don't use that as a password or any form of that, it's just a good example.) And yes, the passphrases are long and a pain in the tit to type in every time, but trust me, it'll prevent anyone from breaking into your accounts. And as a second measure use different passphrases for different things. Also if he knows your phone number or email, delete/change them. If you don't 100% trust the person you're texting or calling and think they'll give him your information, use a texting app. Textplus has usually worked the best for me. You can sign up with fairly anonymous contact info, and they generate you a random phone number that if you don't use in x amount of days they recycle.  As far as him physically stalking you; if he comes within __ amount of feet from you, he is breaking the restraining order. Take tons of photos of him if you see him around. Have someone with you AT ALL TIMES. If he contacts you AT ALL, report it, and keep documents of the incident. Write down the time it happened, the place, the day, and what or where it happened. Make sure to keep fighting. Even though it seems like an endless battle, you can win this. If all else fails, move.  And if he did put a tracker on your phone, if restoring it back to the factory settings doesn't work, get a new phone. Ditch everything and don't download a file you don't recognise.  If you have any other questions feel free to message me. My boyfriend works IT, so I'm sure he can answer any questions you'd need answered about tech shit."

ptsd,3cvnoh,BradburyBunny,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:58:42 2015 UTC,"Apparently prolonged exposure treatment is one of the more successful therapies for PTSD.  I think the idea behind it is to talk about the traumatic memories over and over until the topic becomes mundane/boring and loses its power over you.  Unlike its portrayal in hollywood, exposure therapy is not about re-contextualizing any trauma with new experiences (e.g. going swimming after nearly drowning).  That would risk reinforcing the disorder.  This sort of therapeutic strategy is obviously most difficult in the beginning, and gets easier as sessions pass."

Uncontrollable temper that landed me in court, uncontrollable drinking just so that I could stand my daughter's incessant chatter (which is fine and normal for her and her age. I'm the one with the problem, not her. It was getting so bad though that I was seriously considering giving up custody.) Shoplifting! Embarrassed to say. My therapist explained that it was also a form of self soothing. My brain will try so hard to avoid thinking about whatever is so painful, that it resorts to whatever risky behavior it can to get me to be fully present and in the moment. Then there's the alienating, the insomnia, the lack of motivation to do anything but research and read.  Anyway, I'm optimistic for the first time since this acute episode started two years ago.

For example, I walk into a bar and immediately know where my fire exits are in case of danger.  I'll also profile those sitting at the bar, I do a quick count of everyone in the room.  I pay close attention to where they keep their hands, do they look nervous? Should I be nervous because they are nervous?

We didn't get PTSD through conversations (when x happens, I'm going to react this way) so why would we ""get rid of"" PTSD the same way (when x happens, I'm going to/not going to react this way)  Behavior analytic treatments such as Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) have great success because you're addressing your behavior, in the moment, when a triggering event is occurring (sound, visual, situation, Etc)-not before or after it has already occurred."

I struggle all the time with doing anything and I really can understand what emotions you've been going through - as I've been diagnosed for over 10 years and my life is only slightly better.   I'm in Canada and I don't know how it works elsewhere, but have you tried going to other psychiatrists/therapists? It's totally okay if you feel like you aren't clicking with them, maybe you just need to see someone else. Feeling like you are or are not recieving proper treatment and feeling supported are really critical to mental health therapy! The same person could tell you the same thing day in and day out but unless you're able to emotionally connect wiht it there's not going to be a change, and if you feel that you can't connect with your current psych, that's something you should look at. Don't worry about something like insulting them or hurting their feelings, if they're professional (which they should be) they will understand, and try perhaps to get a referral to another psych or to a public works service that could help you.   Right now it sounds like you're in a really shitty situation (my sympathies about your mom and girlfriend). If you can maybe find a hobby that you can share with other people, maybe you can find a connection there? I know personally that having a tight raiding group in WoW really helped me for a bit, but other things could work too, like taking workshop classes to learn something new like crafts or trying table top rpgs, or finding a group to play sports with, anything where you're putting yourself out there and not staying isolated.   Best wishes!"
ptsd,3cotxk,throwaway81475145,2,Thu Jul 9 16:03:37 2015 UTC,"Sounds like rage.  According to psychologists, rage is a behavior that every person exhibits in some form.  Rage is sometimes associated with the fight-or-flight response and often activated in response to an external cue, in this way it is similar to a panic attack.  Also like panic: depression and anxiety lead to an increased susceptibility to rage.  Unlike panic, rage almost always stems from an underlying anger that turns to rage after an ""outrageous occurance""  aka 'the last straw'.  Some psychologists see rage as being internally focused, constituting an attack on the self rather than on others. They believe this leads to rage being more intense, less focused, and longer-lasting. They also believe this 'self-inflicted' rage is a narcissistic response to one's past injuries. Rage, under this set of theories, is caused from built-up anger from past traumas.  Most of the above I took from wikipedia.  You didn't talk at all about your childhood, but I assume there were some issues based on how you left home.  If you feel you cannot control your rage-episodes, you may want to get into therapy or see a counselor and explore whatever childhood traumas you're avoiding addressing here.  You can also more adeptly identify whether you have any more serious conditions that require medication to treat."

People with C-PTSD struggle to find support, and even when they do they often need to be re-assured that they can trust it.  That it's not going to vanish all-of-a-sudden; that it's not a trick or a scam.  That it's not a lie meant to manipulate and corrupt.  Assuming your friend trusts you, you can be very valuable in this respect.  If, for example, he's resisting a treatment or medication, you can reassure him that it's fine.    I used to have a friend that I would check in with when I was experiencing anxiety that bordered on another panic attack, and somehow just hearing from a trusted source: ""There's nothing dangerous here"" could chill me out a bit."

They simply accept me as I am.  In the United States, colleges have a disability office (or at least, most do).  I'm not sure what country your friend is in, but you should check and see if his university has such a program.  They might be able to help him.  At my school, for example, they give me extra time on assignments during a bad episode, or even let me do extra work to keep me busy if that's what I need.  Whatever I need, the disability office tries to help.    The distance will make it hard.  I remember times when I was so terrified of everything that I couldn't answer a phone or read an email.  Humans failed me so terribly that I couldn't trust any of them.  Don't give up on him.    Depending on what country he's in, there might be a good social service network in place to help him out.  He just won't know how to access it, or even if he does, he won't trust it.  You should look into that if you can and convince him to access it if it exists.  I hope that helps."

Maybe simply moving to a lower-key area could be a middle step before leaving the country.    It sounds like your lawyers really screwed up too.  Are you still in contact with them?  Why have they not fixed the arrest warrant yet?    Obviously the best outcome would start with you being exonerated, then suing the living hell out of the city -- get back the money you spent on the doctors and lawyers, lost work, and not to mention the completely unnecessary pain and suffering.    First step is to get exonerated.  I do not see how the DA could possibly be proceeding with a DUI after the breathalyzer came up 0 twice."
ptsd,3ckewu,GornoP,2,Wed Jul 8 17:42:43 2015 UTC,"it took them about 10 days from the day the warrant was out to get it ""inactivated"" and in those days I did drive my car and would've been arrested if stopped for any reason pretty much. This happened about in early June and I believe the event reverted a lot of progress I had made in recovering from PTSD. After they told me it was taken care of I still got 2 threatening letters from the Sheriff's office saying they would come to house or place of business in big bold letters and saying I had to come in and pay $1000 dollars. My mom now goes through my mail for me because those letter made me panic and it took me down for a whole day in bed and afraid.   It is baffling to me and my lawyers why they are pursuing this case at all. My lawyers want to go to trial and win and they promise me I won't have jail time even if we lose. But the fact that this is a decision to be made by a jury and a judge based largely on police reports FULL OF LIES! a witness(the other driver) who has already lied to my insurance company and will probably lie again is deeply troubling to me. The lawyers say even if the judge is totally against me the worst they'd do is 5-10 days in jail. Here's the thing that might be a light sentence to an average person. To me it will be equivalent to tens of thousands of dollars in fines in the cost of therapy and medication and it will probably ruin my business and relationship.   Being in this predicament is destroying me already. I brush my teeth thinking about how I would brush my teeth in jail.

Although one of the lawyers I consulted with in a big law firm here which I didn't end up hiring told me suing the state is nearly impossible and that he had a case where a cop punched a man inside a police station who was handcuffed with his arms behind his back and broke his front teeth and in the end the cop paid a fine and the man got new teeth.  My uncle says he is willing to help financially down the road to sue the state because he also believes that if no one even tries then nothing ever changes. So we'll see.

ptsd,3cl7du,resealableplasticbag,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:46:30 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, I don't have the personal experience you're looking for. However, everything you're going through is very common. Treating PTSD and addiction separately often creates this same feedback loop you described. That's why it's really important to try and access treatment designed to treat both of these conditions at the same time. There are many treatment programs that tackle both. I'm replying from mobile or I'd have more information, but one of most well-known and well-researched treatment modalities for both conditions is called Seeking Safety. You might find success there.  Additionally, if there's a potential gender component to trauma (such as surviving sexual assault), I recommend TREM, or the Trauma Recovery and Empowerment Movement, which adds in the third piece of gender.  I will note that it can be extremely difficult in some areas to find treatment that works with both of these conditions, so if something like these isn't available, the next best option would be to engage in concurrent treatment for both, with releases of information (when necessary) so your separate providers can talk to each other.  What you're tackling is extremely difficult territory, and I wish you the best."

ptsd,3cl7du,wheneverrichardcory,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:46:24 2015 UTC,"If you have PTSD and are recovering from addiction, how do you cope? What strategies did you use to replace the role of substances (or behaviors) to cope with your trauma once you got clean? Any advice at all would be most welcome.   My story reads a lot like yours.  The only thing that helps me stay sober is reminding myself that PTSD is ultimately a process of healing; the brain instigates it in an effort to process trauma.  Supposedly, according to other people, this is a healing process that makes things better.   But the process cannot occur while one is engaging in addictive behaviors, particularly substance abuse.  Substance abuse effectively halts the progression of healing from trauma.  That is very terrible news, because what it means for me is that substance abuse keeps me in the terrible cycle of re-enacting and re-living the trauma. My brain stays stuck, and cannot heal.  I trap myself, very literally, in the past in my brain.  Once I sobered up I got really bad flashbacks; I have PTSD from a bad childhood as well.  It got way worse and it is still really bad.  But nothing is worse than trapping myself in that traumatic past forever.  I do not feel at all like PTSD is a healing process, I don't feel better, but hell, that trauma was bad enough to go through the first time, and the flashbacks are bad enough to get once on a go-around, heaven forbid I ever lock myself into that trauma and repeat repeat repeat forever.    Therapy is very important.  You can find one on the ""psychology today"" website for the U.S.; finding someone who specializes in childhood trauma is key.  EMDR and Schema therapy are two therapy types I have not done much myself, but I've heard great things about them.  Group therapy, for either abuse survivors and/or PTSD/CPTSD sufferers, is also very very helpful.  Mostly, stay clean and sober.  Because your brain wants to do this thing, or you wouldn't have CPTSD.  So since you have it, your brain is already trying.  The best you can do is seek support, and try to stay out of its poor way.  Substance abuse, other addictions, and detrimental behaviors, as well as abusive relationships, toxic people, and any currently unsafe situation for you, distracts your busy brain from healing itself."

I've not had any flashbacks (well, not visual/auditory ones anyway) since I got sober, but that's definitely something that worries me.   I have therapy twice a week: individual with my therapist (who's an excellent LCSW versed in trauma and addiction), and one group session with other folks of a similar background. On top of that, I hit SA meetings about 3x/week. It's helping, but of course there are still plenty of rough days that I go through that make me need to hear that I'm on the right path.

I found myself sobbing at times.  But that's okay. Letting those emotions out, in a safe way, is good.   It will get better with time. But if you think its not, you need to see a professional. That doesn't mean you are weak or that you have something wrong with you. You are just getting help."

Just cause someone else's shit pile is bigger than yours doesn't change that it stinks and in the end is still crappy. Don't compare your issues to others, I used to do that all the time as a way of telling myself that I was pathetic for feeling so upset when others have it worse than me. You had a lifetime of fear and abusive behaviors to endure, that is enough to amount to having PTSD."

Fixing someone else won't make what happened to you feel better, and even people who are healthy enough to help other people often get hurt by the process and are mostly unsuccessful in their efforts.  I  have complex PTSD and was a doormat/punching bag for most of my life :/ Making myself realize and believe that I actually deserve to be treated how I treat other people was a long, hard road but I feel ten times better about myself and happier in general :)  I know it sounds dumb and you'll feel silly at first, but look at yourself in the mirror and tell yourself you deserve to be treated well. Even just looking at yourself and not turning away is a great step :)  Good on you for being introspective and being aware of potentially harmful behaviors :)   Edited to say that fixing people can be a way of trying to convince someone else AND yourself that you deserve to be treated well. Repeatedly failing at fixing toxic people becomes justification for your low self esteem/self worth when in reality you should never have to convince someone to treat you well."

I think because we know personally how much it sucks to have our brains hijack us and take us on a ride where we end up doing things we don't want to makes us want to empathize when we see other people doing things that are obviously (to the rest of the world) detrimental to themselves. For me, I try to empathize with toxic people, but also understand that I can't help them. Empathizing doesn't mean we have to let them keep treating us poorly. We can understand and still realize that we have to cut them out of our lives if necessary."

But not everyone is an abuser, and its really hard seeing the difference between dickhead, dangerous, and socially inept. I think for now I just have to remind myself that my feelings are valid but a separate thing from my judgement -which is still kinda wonky."

ptsd,3cd3xj,cryslea,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:28:00 2015 UTC,"Sure :)  I have PTSD stemming from childhood sexual abuse, rape, and domestic violence. All of these experiences left me very fragmented and broken off from my body. Yoga has allowed me to get in touch with my body again in a structured and safe way.   I imagine any physical activity would help in this way, but I do a style of yoga that includes the mindfulness and meditation aspects. This has helped me be aware of my breath and thoughts, and has encouraged me to tolerate unpleasant sensations without being swept away. The most notable result has been the ability to notice precursors to a flashback and respond in a way to prevent or minimize it.   It has also helped me with dissociative symptoms. Again, I can identify the precursors to dissociation and find ways of grounding myself so that the impacts are much smaller than they might have been otherwise.   I believe there is also some scientific evidence that shows that yoga can help rewire the brain, especially around the amygdala and HPA axis, as well as improve heart rate variability. (Bessel van der Kolk is a good resource for this, and the book The Body Keeps the Score, while not about yoga, does talk a bit about yoga as treatment for PTSD.)  Now mind you, therapy was DEFINITELY an important component, and I don't think I would have been successful with yoga as a trauma treatment on its own. But yoga has been vital to my recovery."
ptsd,3cd3xj,Pippafert,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:07:05 2015 UTC,"Yoga can be very fulfilling and it's excellent for fitness. It helps you find calm spaces in your mind. I enjoyed yoga immensely a few years ago when I was able to do it. Physically I have issues now and can't do it but their sheer focus on accomplishing the form Narrows your focus to nothing more than that. Yoga made a space in my mind. It was like taekwondo or Krav Maga,  both of which I study but neither of which I can do right now due to health issues. If you are  someone who has a difficult time concentrating, I would recommend a martial art or yoga.  For me it's a total concentration zone with no outside thoughts interfering"

Anxiety still persists but I'm climbing up on the antidepressant ladder while continuing to work hard in therapy, and I'm hopeful that I'll get it in check within a year or so. My relationships with others have improved; my worst bad days now are better than my best good days before; I just finished my best semester ever in school, taking the hardest classes I ever have.

ptsd,3c9cbk,JustStopDude,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:01:42 2015 UTC,"I can fill you in on my background. I grew up with spina bifida. That meant I spent a good amount of my childhood away from my family in the hospital. I also had a mother who was physically abusive. Given her childhood, she did the best she could, but it was not a healthy situation.   I never recognized those issues. It was my norm. So I tended to respond to stress to how I learned from my mother, which was alcohol and violence.   I ended up doing six years in the navy. I saw people get seriously hurt, I got hurt, and I lost friends and colleagues to suicide. While I was in, my coping mechanisms started to fail. I couldn't drink enough and I was getting into so many fights that I was having to get surgery on my hands on a regular basis.   I started seeing a shrink. She got me to recognize that my childhood was not normal. I realized I was drinking to mask my pain. I was getting worse and worse until I started working with her and I learned what my triggers were and how I needed to learn healthy coping techniques. Over the course of about a year I went from drinking everyday to now...I drink maybe once or twice a month, usually in social settings.   I finished my six year contract (I got better my fifth year in). I got into college and earned my mechanical engineering degree. I now work as a field engineer for a Japanese company.   Its a tough job that requires a LOT of travel, long hours, and a great deal of stress. But that serves me quite well. I've learned that if I am busy, my mind doesn't focus on shit.   I think most people would say that I'm not healthy or normal. But I like my job. I like the long hours. I like the challenge. I'm not drinking anymore. I'm not going out to start fights with random people. I've learned to connect with people outside of work.  I still have my moments where I will focus on some terrible events. I'll get a wave of rage and want to punch something. But I recognize it for what it is...and I know it will go away.   It took a lot of work. If dealing with PTSD was something easy to do, everyone would do it. I had to sit down and expose and examine feelings and events I had been suppressing since childhood. And I had to learn to forgive my mother and recognize she was as much a product of her upbringing as I was. Otherwise, the cycle of pain would just continue."
ptsd,3c96qb,PTSD_Spouse,4,Mon Jul 6 01:50:41 2015 UTC,"If she is physically hurting you, let her know you are not fucking around. I know how hard it can be to break the cycle, but it's not okay. When you grow up in an unstable environment, it can be all too easy to fall back on what you know. From someone with a similar background, it can be nearly impossible to distinguish between what I have done because of my traumatic past or because of me as a person. All of the events molded me. I hate it, but I can't change it, as much as I wish I could.  Sometimes it's difficult for me to come down from all of the emotions. My trauma counselor has made me realize that I need to allow myself to feel them instead of fight them, which I think is what has sent me over the edge in the past. As irrational as it is, sometimes when I get angry, or any emotion for that matter, it doesn't matter what the other person does, my emotions are just going to escalate.     My advice would be to talk to her to come up with a safe word or saying. When my boyfriend and I fight and I don't feel like I can de-escalate, I tell him that the line has been crossed. It signals to him that 1. I'm upset and I'm not okay 2. That it's not personal, it just is. 3. That we both need to back off of fighting for a bit. aaaand that he will probably be needed to hug me. But it goes both ways. You need to be allowed personal boundaries that you can protect, but you need to be clear that ""when I say ""safe"", it's not that I don't want to talk. It means that we need to hit the pause button until you calm down so we can both be safe, and we can talk later when we can be a team together.""   Also, it sounds like you two could benefit from couples counseling, and hopefully she is in therapy already?"
ptsd,3c96qb,airyesmad,3,Mon Jul 6 04:02:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your response,  I'll elaborate where I can.  My wife has never directly punched, kicked, slapped or hit me.  She has tried to get in my way, and both pushed and pulled me with her full force to try and prevent me from leaving a room or building.  She has aggressively poked me while loudly yelling, but she has never been violent.  If she ever is, I'm done immediately.  I'll find a hotel, a lawyer, and be done.    I totally know that this is her survival mechanisms coming out.  She's been in therapy for a while, and the patterns from her childhood that she falls back into are known by me, her, her network, and my therapist.    My wife currently has a therapist, a DBT therapy group, a childhood trauma therapy group, a psychopharmacologist, and a primary care physician.    I have a CBT therapist that I see to help me maintain my physical and mental health while supporting my wife, and also helping me understand how the PTSD works   We had a couples therapist.  The therapist helped us develop coping mechanisms that have worked for almost 2 years now until my wife ignored every single one of them today.  The therapist did not have PTSD training however, and post-diagnosis, the ability of the therapist to help us evaporated quickly. I'm ok being asked to apologize for triggering my wife.  Its not something I ever mean to do, but I'm sorry that I do it and that it happens.  I'm NOT ok with being asked to apologize for the original trauma.  I didn't beat the shit out of my wife, her dad did, 20 years ago.  Once that gap formed, we struggled as a couple until I refused to continue seeing the counselor.  Our[my wife and I] relationship immediately improved because there was no longer a crutch that was validating my wife's PTSD as a reasonable voice. (My wife's support network has been developed since we left the couples counselor.  She did not have it at that time, and she has improved a lot because of it).  We've been doing really well since, have been able to deescalate and resolve well.  I'm reaching out for advice because the severity of this meltdown, and the fact that the things that have worked well for me in the past did absolutely nothing today."
ptsd,3c96qb,airyesmad,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:50:51 2015 UTC,"I think sometimes an episode like this is not abnormal. Even with all of the tools in the box, sometimes it's not enough.  If it happens more than occasionally, that would be a cause for concern. She does, however, need to recognize that she overstepped the line. PTSD can be very complex and hard to understand, but you both have boundaries and they need to be equally important. Thumbs up to you for putting so much effort into trying to understand her condition and trying to help her."
ptsd,3c96qb,LadyAlekto,2,Thu Jul 9 16:55:22 2015 UTC,What did trigger that?
ptsd,3c96qb,LadyAlekto,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:52:58 2015 UTC,"I have some ideas, but I have been unable to have a rational discussion with my wife about everything that's happened.  One piece of my wife's support network left today (known well beforehand), and my wife has been emotional about that.    This morning, I was trying to plan out the prep for a vacation we're taking soon, and the discussion went from ""what do we need to do beforehand"" to ""you've ruined the vacation!"" in about 15 seconds.  My wife was reading aggression, malice and anger in ""do we have time to get me a new suit?"" and reacted as if I had said ""I'm going to run around naked and embarrass you""  My wife's childhood trauma was systemic, not a specific event.  There were dozens, if not hundreds of instances of abuse in her childhood that she can and has responded to.  I'm willing to bet there's some involvement with a suit in some trauma from her past, but I just don't know at this point."
ptsd,3c96qb,LadyAlekto,4,Mon Jul 6 02:33:46 2015 UTC,"I less believe it was the suit.  Ive got a extreme case of ptsd myself, theres hundreds of thing that can trigger me. But there MUST has been something to trigger that emotional response with such a severity.  The stress from someone leaving she relied on is a strong stress factor, but i do not belive that something just simple happened.  Also i know from myself, fear of abandonment, coupled with the person i fear will leave me, running away from me, basically equals into a complete breakdown.  There must also be some kind of counter-trigger (pretty much always is, needs to be discovered and communicated though) my partner knows, when that fear triggers, he can do nothing, but hold me and be there.  edit  I way too often heard ""unable for a rational discussion"" from everyone who is not willing to listen what is being said, or wrose, listens and wont respond at all to anything being said. And this also very often from my profession to work with trauma patients."
ptsd,3c96qb,PantomimeWhores,5,Mon Jul 6 02:39:12 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your response, I'll elaborate where I can.  The suit is my best guess at a trigger at the moment.  With my wife's earlier triggers, she has been good at working with her support network, identifying her trigger, and helping me understand how I need to change to avoid triggering her in the future.  I avoid about a dozen subjects or phrases explicitly because of this.  I'm hoping that she can do that again with this so that I can avoid triggering her like this ever again.   The severity of today is due to a number of things, both on my end and my wife's.  Yesterday was a family gathering, and she was around many of the people that enabled her trauma to happen (she has not talked to her dad in 4 years, and has no plans to ever, again).  I also hate dealing with her family because they are all lazy, selfish assholes who order me around like I'm their servant.  The piece of her support network left as well.  I acknowledge that I have been oversensitive because I'm physically and mentally exhausted from dealing with her family yesterday.  I also acknowledge that she was on edge too after dealing with them.    My wife got triggered and was compelled to be incredibly angry.  I was the only thing around to get angry at, and she unloaded on me.  She found any reason to be angry, from dishes that I was USING not being in the dishwasher, to trauma-influenced memories of me doing things that her father had done 20 years prior.  She was irrational, would not listen to my responses, did not listen when I asked for space, and pursued me to continue the fight when I tried to leave.    Regardless of her triggered state, me saying ""You're hurting me with this anger, please back off, I need space"" and having that be ignored for the purpose of yelling at me more is NOT OK.  My wife abusing me is not excused by her PTSD.  She doesn't get a pass.    I say ""unable to have a rational discussion"" because I have not been able to.  Usually, getting away from my wife, cooling down, giving her time to cool down, gives us the ability to at least identify what happened and apologize.  I have not been able to speak for 5 seconds the couple times I've tried without her immediately going back into her meltdown.  She's never sustained one for this long before, which is one major reason why I'm so distraught about this."
ptsd,3c96qb,mmcrowle,3,Mon Jul 6 03:46:14 2015 UTC,"I was unaware of this connection, and that does correlate with a lot of my wife's behavior.  I'll work with my therapist on finding an appropriate way to bring this up.  Thank you."
ptsd,3c96qb,PantomimeWhores,2,Mon Jul 6 04:37:42 2015 UTC,"Hmmmm that gives a whole different perspective, especially the ""nedless anger"" part, my partner is a prime candidate for this too.  And i understand the draining part in this matter....  What else i see is left, that as soon you both are able to communicate about the incident, ask her, gently, what happened, what she felt and saw and how you both can work on this  What i belive is the reason she went on it for so long, was that she feared to be left alone, and you ran away, basically affirming her fears"
ptsd,3c96qb,auburnstark,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:50:33 2015 UTC,"I don't have solid answers for you. I have experienced this, so I know how frightening it can be when the only way out is blocked and you just want it to end. It's a powerful instinct to escape.  Based on my experience, I can only suggest that you avoid saying or doing anything confrontational. Using words like ""trigger"" and ""anger"" will only make it worse, so don't do that. Phrase things around yourself and your needs. Say you need space, but don't accuse. You may not be able to stop it, but you can take some wind out of the sails. Don't call the police, I doubt they are equipped to handle the situation and it will probably make her trust you less in the future. That's bad.  Are you ever in physical danger? If not, you might learn to not engage. I have used self hypnosis to help recognise when I react poorly to this behaviour - it helps a little, and can sometimes stop an escalation. If it does get physical, then you probably do need to get away somehow. Can't speak from much experience there. It's been rare enough that I just take it and hope for the best. I would guess that your office strategy is about all you can do."

ptsd,3c96qb,mydaddyisadrunkass,3,Mon Jul 6 02:54:51 2015 UTC,"I would take out the ""I can't take your anger"" bit. Just make it about what YOU need while acknowledging that she is in distress.

ptsd,3c96qb,auburnstark,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:13:47 2015 UTC,"That's right. It will be hard for her to be compassionate in this state. The best I've been able to get across is that I don't like what's happening and I don't want to handle it like this. It won't make her stop, and she will probably have more to say before it's over, but stick with your side, don't play up the victim side too much and don't accuse. She has to see that you are on her side but you need to be free to work through this in your own way. That can take the edge off and lead to a slow reduction in hostilities."
ptsd,3c7bvy,partnerindirestraits,13,Sun Jul 5 15:44:29 2015 UTC,"Don't blame yourself man. It doesn't sound like you handled it poorly at all. You told her how the situation made you feel and that's just basic communication. PTSD does suck, but what is she doing to improve her situation? If she isn't showing any effort I wouldn't expect things to change anytime soon. Don't blame this on yourself. You deserve happiness and if she is unwilling to work with you to improve your guys situation then maybe it's time to end things romantically. That doesn't sound even remotely like a healthy relationship."

She has medical marijuana for her PTSD but I don't believe she's doing anything else, nothing she mentions anyway.  I really feel I hold a lot of responsibility for this though and I feel awful about it. I'm not the best when it comes to communication on this topic and I feel like I was too blunt and she reacted defensively and expressed how I made her feel her self image was worthless because of how I described how I viewed her living situation and how I wanted it to change.   I wish now I knew how to have communicated that better, but when I was writing it all down I couldn't figure out how to broach these issues in a way that wouldn't hurt her feelings without taking away from how poorly they were impacting myself in our relationship"

It might be better to let this relationship go for your own sake, or at least cool it to just friends until she starts to make real adjustments, which she may realistically never do."
ptsd,3c7bvy,GettinDrunkWithJesus,2,Sun Jul 5 19:56:48 2015 UTC,"I actually took some nonviolent communication courses. Best way to peacefully communicate is saying ""when I see this, I feel like this"" your not attacking her, just telling her how you feel. If she doesn't care about your feelings she probably doesn't care enough about you to try and communicate. That might hurt but I mean come on. You can't save her Man. That's not on you. You can love and care for Her but a relationship is dependent on two at least someone functional people.  And marijuana hasn't helped my PTSD. At all. It's just given me social anxiety but to each their own. Best wishes. Feel free to pm me."

She needs to be seeking therapy, medication, or whatever else it is that she needs to be able to function and take care of herself. It is not fair to you. It sounds like you have been MORE THAN understanding. I applaud your commitment. I don't think that you expressing your needs to her is mistreatment. You need to protect yourself from depression too, or you will eventually resent her and your own self for having to put up with it."

You seem like a really kind person who wants to make things work and are very considerate of her needs, but you have needs too. I find it a little odd/sad that she thinks its healthier for her to not involve you into her emotional progress, in fact it feels like she has given up and thinks you will do everything for her. If this is going to work out at all, she has to start allowing you back into her emotional life, otherwise how is it even a relationship anymore? As it stands she is just taking without giving back. If she is allowing you to communicate right now, I think you two need to have a talk and express that you were frustrated, you're trying to make things work but that you're tired of being shut out.  The thing I should ask though, do you honestly feel capable of continuing on with her? It's okay if the answer is no, you've been in this battle with her for years and you can't help her if she isn't willing to help herself. Unless her behavior changes it's likely nothing about this is going to change."

I'm okay helping out, I'm okay listening to rants and holding her while she cries, I'm okay with the idea of taking care of her for the rest of her life if need be. However it just gets so much harder when I feel I'm kept on the outside and don't see a lot of long term progress...I just wish I did and I wish she considered it important to tell me things or allow me to ask"
ptsd,3c7bvy,alizarincrimson7,4,Sun Jul 5 17:41:53 2015 UTC,"Why don't you try communicating to her that you want to be there for her, but you can't help if she doesn't let you know whats wrong, and that you think it's doing her more harm than good to keep it all to herself? A relationship is a two way street and I understand how hard it is opening up to someone about those deepest things, but by closing off that side of her to you she is shutting you out in a much bigger way than I think she is even aware of. If you can get her to understand that, then it is possible to work on things together, but if she is adamant on shutting you out I don't see how she will improve. If you approach it carefully from the tone of 'I care and want to help but don't know how', then hopefully that will be enough to get her to start talking again."

Be aware that she probably felt worthless and disgusted with herself before you said anything. I don't see any fault in you sitting her down and telling her how it made you feel. That's what people in a healthy relationship do, right? Just because she has a condition doesn't make you a monster for ending it.  I've been married for more than five years, my wife has always known about my PTSD. Now, granted, she met me after I'd already fought to get it under control but when I have a bad day she's always there.

ptsd,3c610d,GameofCheese,1 point,Sun Jul 5 05:01:14 2015 UTC,"I suggest you get the book The Body Keeps The Score by Bessel Van Der Kolk and read it together. Dr. Van Der Kolk specializes in treating trauma and PTSD and is currently the world's leading expert in healing from trauma.  This is not a self help book but a book to help both him and you understand what's going on and what his treatment options are. I'd also get him into therapy. I have found internal family systems therapy to be very useful in recovering from PTSD as well as EMDR.   You might also want to make a sign and talk to your neighbors about fireworks and have them let you know before they're going to light some off. Talk to your husband about what coping skills he finds useful and have him use those in times of stress. Some people need earplugs, some people find music comforting, and others find breathing exercises or writing useful. He'll have to play around with it as some coping skills work better in certain situations than others.   As for what you can do to be a better support, just take care of yourself mentally and physically. It's exhausting being the support person to someone with PTSD and it's very easy to get lost in their illnese and neglect your own wants and needs. If you aren't taking care of you then you aren't going to be any good to him.    Also, learn and know what your limits are. You can only take so much stress before you're not any good to him. Sometimes you're just going to have to learn to say I love you but I can't do it right now. Leading into  I'd start a list of resources and keep it like on your refrigerator. The suicide hotline can be very beneficial in helping those with PTSD not feel alone. I'm sure you're a wonderful support but sometimes it's mentally helpful to talk to someone who gets what it's like and you don't have to explain it to. You don't have PTSD and sometimes words just fail you to describe just how awful it can be at times. Definitely keeping a list of places he can go or call outside of you is helpful and healthy for everyone involved."

I will also look for some outside resources, the base we are currently at is not really that great for support. He definitely does not feel comfortable confiding in anyone, even therapists. Perhaps he would talk to another soldier, I just don't know. As far as my own limits, I usually am able to cope fairly well.

I carried them all the time for years, even to deal with kid noise at the grocery store. Over time I learned to tolerate noise better and could go without, but I learned to tolerate it better by reducing the overload. Even knowing I had the plugs with me made it easier to stay in my skin.  Big fan of strategic distraction. The middle of the night is a perfectly good time to catch up on some tv series. I have found no therapuetic advantages to laying there, feeling the feelings and thinking about the trauma. Better to do all that when I'm not triggered, and distract when triggered.  My Kindle is also like a life raft, I mainline escapist fiction when the walls are closing in and I don't want to wake up my SO.  I wouldn't disclose to the neighbors or ask them to change their behavior unless it is something your SO really wants. Doing so can be unintentionally humiliating... they will never see him the same way again. Because of the stigma around veterans and violence, disclosure tends to create fear and distrust and distance rather than caring."

As far as the neighbors, we live in the woods next to a state park. So even if I knew which of our neighbors was setting off the fireworks, which would be difficult, it also wouldn't stop the park from doing their fireworks display. Most years we try and get away for a few days, but this year we couldn't. We are also fairly close to the ranges the base uses, and the past few weeks they have been quite active so that probably isn't helping either."

ptsd,3c41zu,hollymakesawish,4,Sat Jul 4 15:56:27 2015 UTC,"Hello! I have both helped to train a victim service dog and completed my thesis on psychiatric service dogs so I think I can give you some information!  In order to find a service dog you will need to find a company who can provide you with one. as of right now, the VA does not recognize it as a form of treatment and so it may not be covered but projects like wounded warriors and others may provide dogs to you for free with the understanding that the dog will be retired at some point and you will have a new dog come in to take over.  I highly recommend that you find a place that specializes in service dogs for PTSD and not physical disabilities because there is a difference between training with a physical disability and training with a psychological issue. The dog can potentially be trained to do things such as wake you up from nightmares, alert you to people coming up behind you, help you re-orient to present time during dissociation or flashback episodes, so dogs specially trained for those type of skills are great. This area is not well regulated so I highly recommend that you check out organizations that are recognized by assistance dogs international so you know you are getting a good standard of care and training.   Sadly, the waitlist is often long and many people are tempted to get a dog and train it themselves. It's a possibility but I warn you that it can be very stressful on both you and the dog (some dogs can't handle this kind of emotional dependence or may pick up bad habits through a novice trainer plus having a new puppy is like having a toddler dropped in your lap and depending on how severe your PTSD is it may aggravate symptoms ) and you won't know if the dog is suited to the work until you've already invested a lot of time and effort. It can be daunting to feel like you have to start over. You would also have to get the dog certified which changes depending on where you live, but often they have to pass a public access test and some other form of testing before they are legally allowed to be in public places that restrict dogs. I caution you against doing this yourself but if you feel desperate getting a pet for companionship could be an option.   All of the people I interviewed for my thesis said that having the dog was the best treatment they could ever have. They were overwhelmingly positive, the dogs were their battle buddies at night, their support during the day, and the unconditional love between them is amazing. But there are some negatives as well. Some of the downsides are the stress you can encounter if your dog becomes sick, or you are unable to bring our dog for some reason. The sadness of saying goodbye to them when they retire/pass away. They are not cure alls, they may help lessen the symptoms but won't necessarily make you totally better. The worst barrier was other people's ignorance of the laws or why these dogs can be used. You may find yourself having to educate others on why it's inappropriate to touch a working dog or why you aren't blind!   Finally I will leave you with a few organizations you can look up. I don't know if you are a veteran (there are more resources for them than civilians) or where you are located but in the U.S. You could check out https://paws4people.org (they have a program called paws4vets specially for veterans.) I highly recommend them, they are amazing.   Also look at http://www.puppiesbehindbars.com/home  Here's one for Canada http://woundedwarriors.ca/how-we-help/ptsd-service-dogs/  And finally you can look up local organizations on the assistance dog international website http://www.assistancedogsinternational.org  I hope this was helpful information for you!

Not all dogs are suited for this kind of work and can be really stressed out by it. All it takes is one dog improperly trained who misbehaves in public, or snaps and nips someone and it contaminates public opinion. However I also know the waitlists can be huge and people don't want to wait years. The best thing to do would be to contact a trainer who is ADI certified and ask them about ways they can help you. http://www.assistancedogsinternational.org  The field is very unregulated at this time but there would be state/country dependant benchmarks the dog would need to be able to pass to become certified for public places."

Her fee was half off (of $80!).   She's a gorgeous pit bull with her own issues, as a rescue. But they do a really great job there of training dogs before they find homes.

There are countless places theoughout the country (us) that do both of  these.   The paperwork usually consists of extensive medical background and a doctors/psych diagnosis.

The other morning a swat officer had to search my backyard for a vehicular homicide suspect, and I had a similar flashback experience. I've also started to experience a lot of mental slow down and stress when I'm rooms with lots of people talking at once.  This is more a reflection of the anxiety, but I've started freaking out about my health. Thanks to a shitty doctor visit, I've been terrified I have diabetes, so lots of additional anxiety there. I'm doing stuff to resolve that situation, but Obama care moves at the speed of Not Fast.  What I'm doing now to try dealing: breathing techniques, laying in a cool dark room when feeling freaked out. Talking out my anxiety with my wife. My counselor prior to the appearance of the PTSD-like symptoms told me to hug my wife whenever I started to feel freaked out until the feeling passes. The breathing techniques work intermittently now: with just anxiety, I can do 3ish 10 count breath holds and it will evaporate, but now, if I try to hold longer than 2 or 3 seconds, it becomes almost physically painful in a way that I can recognize as panic.

Drove in to work, traffic was so good I missed my turn off the freeway. Usually it takes longer to get there! No biggie. Still make it in to work on time. Still feeling really good. Then my boss comes in and tells me my lab is getting shut down, pretty much effective immediately. I've been working for them for 11 years in August. Pretty much straight out of highschool. So that was a bit of a let down to say the least. Now I'm looking for another job.   To make things worse, I got a written warning today at my second job. Yeah, I've been working my ass off to get on top of things and sort my life out. 14 hour working days monday to friday. Much fun. It just seems all too coincidental that I got a warning after making a formal complaint about a security guard exposing himself to me while I was cleaning the mens toilets. The warning was because I missed a small bit of vacuuming because I had run out of time...  I'm so over everything right now. My partner has gone back to work and will be away for a couple of weeks. I don't know what I'm going to do. I keep thinking of ways I can end it. I think about what I'm going to write in my letter. I've been debating whether or not to just have one letter that everyone can share or if I write letters for the inportant individuals in my life. I still wont do it though. I know this. The act of taking my own life scares me enough that I'm not going to do it. Not because I will die, but because I might not do it properly.    If I could just go to sleep and not wake up that would be great. I am so tired of life right now. I'm tired of being on edge. Tired of restless nights. Tired of crying myself to sleep. Tired of being a pain in the ass girlfriend. Tired of pretending to be happy. Just so tired. Sometimes I just wish my rapist had of killed me. Instead I just had my face smashed in and choked till I passed out.   The hole is getting deeper and the light is slowly fading away.   I have an appointment with my therapist next week. Hopefully she can knock some sense into me. I still haven't told my partner exactly how I am feeling. He's one of the few things in my life that make me really happy. He knows Im having a rough time but I dont think he can comprehend it. If things had spread them selves out a bit more Id be able to handle it better.   I hate refering to the incidents as anniversaries ... but I dont know how else to say it. The rape is fresh in my mind still so this year it was a little harder than normal. The guy got locked up at the begining of the year and he isnt going to be out for a long time. But I tried to forget it for four years. Then he contacted me again and that was it. He'll be in prison for 24 years.   My birthday is next month and that takes its toll. Everyone wishing me a happy birthday. The last thing I want is to celebrate it. Every time I am wished a happy birthday I am always reminded of the night of my 10th birthday. My parents forgot it. they were out and left us in the capable hands of our neighbour. Too bad he couldn't keep his hands to himself. This night was special though. This night he'd give me a present I would never forget. He had been building up to it over the last few months. Finally, he got to give it to me. It hurt. I passed out - I am almost certain he spiked my drink. When I woke up he was still inside of me. Once he was done he showered me. Washed the blood off and put me back to bed. He wished me a happy birthday and left.  Ugh. I just. I can't function properly atm with so much stuff happening. Im really sorry for the vent/rant. I just need to get it out without hurting myself."

ptsd,3c2nwz,curiouscorncob,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:53:16 2015 UTC,I think you need to figure out what happened to you in the past and try to approach it in a safe controlled environment.. Watch the whole situation from an observer pov and try to understand what was going on then. You probably learned to cope by shifting down and generally speaking emotion so that behavior is now pretty much synchronous with everything you do in your daily life. It will take time to unravel but you have to slowly force out the emotional plug that prevents you from feeling and thus having desire and later real ambition for better things in life.
ptsd,3c2nwz,hulahulagirl,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:20:52 2015 UTC,"I know....I went through so much shit in the past that I barely allow myself to remember any of it. I remember a time when I used to be so optimistic, so full of life, so full of inspiration about anything. Whatever it was I wanted to do it. I grew up without father, and I was the oldest brother of 3. I pretty much had to learn everything on my own...but even as I say that, I'm not sure what examples I can give for that. I suck with women so I didn't learn that, I got fucked with in grade school...all the way through college. (Not so much in college but at that point I was an outcast...i still didn't know how to stick up for myself)   Because I grew up being fucked with all the time, I told myself everyday that I would get stronger. And I had it in my head that if I made friends with the people that were messing with me, it'd make me stronger eventually because my mom was proud of me because I played football and she wanted me to go to college to be a doctor because that's what i said i wanted to be when i was like 8....I had a 3.0....but I convinced myself that that's what I wanted to do. Needless to say it backfired.  I don't really get flashbacks anymore, it's more like a monotone...I don't care about anything feeling and I just am on autopilot. My grandmother badmouthed my mother constantly, she mentally abused me and guilt tripped me into feeling bad for her all the time because she would tell everyone she wanted to kill herself or she would fake having a heart attack or w.e.. My mother is in her own little world, because all she cares about is having this perfect family that isn't going to happen. She's lazy af and I can't rely on her for a damn thing. She's been with this same guy for 15+ years who's a pathetic excuse of a man. And she pushes him on us to this day. He's done so much shit in the past....I hate this guy with a passion.   My one brother is going through his own issue where he never helps anyone but himself out. And all he cares about is having a good time....and makes excuse about everything.  My other brother is conceded and messes around too much. He's probably the most sane though years ago I took him up my mom's to live whenever they got another house (they lost the other one and it took then years to get another, so we were staying in at grandma's house for years) because I didn't want him going through the same shit I did with my grandmother. Or go to the highschool that treated me like shit.   I developed a habit where I would try to act like somebody else, because I hated myself. It got to the point where I tried to act like somebody different each day. I think this is when my monotone feelings started to build up because I decided to stop doing that. Everytime I started to notice I was going that, I shut myself down....that was 2 years ago before I joined the army when I started. It took almost a year but I almost got rid of the habit. I still find myself wanting to do it because I'm sick of this monotone personality, but I don't want to act like somebody else....i'm just fucking confused. I don't know how to act. I don't know how I feel. I don't know why I should be mad when I am. I feel like I don't deserve to be. I feel like I don't deserve to be happy...and when I start to get happy, I feel uneasy....like something isn't right.   I have no motivation and it fucking sucks because I need to lose weight. But what's the point? I don't care about myself...i lost it before and I got screwed over by my ex.   Idk...I tried meditating today and it helped a little. Maybe if I get better at it, it will help more and more. Idk at this point."

Don't give in to what you've had to live with. Don't accept that. You say you have no motivation, but it's all there in the things you write.   You don't want to be stuck in that toxic cycle. You're aware of your past, and your present. You know things are bad and in your mind you won't accept this and that's the best part. You're already fighting this as you write.  But don't give in to that habit of going back to that autopilot mode. You're not alone in this; many people suffer from what you suffer and the ones who always seem to be okay are the ones who have overcome it learn to build effective knee jerk reaction habits that help them move out of the autopilot  in a much quicker time whenever shit hits the fan.  You'll have to find yours, whether its picking up a pen and draw or blind surfing youtube until you find a video that gets you curious or enthralled. Meditation is good but build more than just one go-to habit.   Don't be too hard on yourself if you fail. You've been trained; you've learned it through rigorous conditioning growing up to be an unhealthy kind of perfect because of your mother, and you'll have to catch yourself doing it. Then throw that away. Let yourself go.  Believe me when I say you're on the right path to getting out of this for good. Move out if you can; you can't help your family as it is you're still trying to stand up for yourself. Remember that everything is temporary and even difficult times like these will pass. When you're better; and if you want to; you can always return and try to make things better for the rest of your family.   But you have to think about yourself for now. Work on yourself, whether it's a small jog every day to clear your head, or drinking down a bottle of water when things get heavy. Find time for a cup of tea out alone and find a part-time job to keep yourself busy all the time. Then just wait and see.  Things will get better, I promise."

I am trying desperately to change my way if thinking..my perception. But the odds are so much against me.   Don't get me wrong, I know everyone has their problems and I know there are a probably a million worse situations than this so I'm not trying to sound like I'm being a wuss or anything, but when you have absolutely nothing in your life to look forward to because all of your hope was taken...I let them take it...it's hard as hell to get myself to want to do anything.  I recently had a blood test this past week. I got the results from my endocrinologist. Aparently my t levels are around 400. I'm 27, and I looked up the average t for a guy my age is around 650. Although they didn't seem too concerned about it and said I was fine. I'm looking up natural ways to increase these levels and losing weight is one of the most effective, but damn...i'm can't seem to get myself motivated to do that again. I'm gaining more weight each day and I'm sick of it....Than again I don't really care. It's this constant fight in my head to get myself to care about myself.   On top of that, my work has been annoying as hell to me. The people I work with are a bunch of miserable fucks who hate their jobs. I work as a security job making 12.50 atm and all you do at this job is sit on your ass and try not to fall asleep because I'm on midnight shifts....these midnight shifts suck ass too and I'm trying to find another job.

My therapist used an example of a police officer to had been having nightmares after a bad encounter, his method of reclaiming his dreams was to turn into the hulk and smash the bad guys. At first I thought it was super ridiculous but I eventually warmed up to it.  My reclaiming method is emotion projection, so the bad guy feels all the pain he is causing, causing him to (in my dreams) break down and stop hurting me.   A big part of it is convincing yourself everything will be okay in your dreams because you can now protect yourself/loved ones.  Before you go to sleep, it's important to remind yourself of your newfound super hero and how it will change the out come. It took me about two weeks of doing this nightly before I started kicking ass in my dreams and I've been nightmare free now for about month.   (: it's worth a try at  least.  I also use marijuana and yoga to help process everything but what really helped me was writing my traumas down, all of them, and reading my story over and over, adding more details as I remembered.   If you ever need someone to talk to, I'll be more than happy to listen."

People commonly apply what is refereed to as the ""personal optimism bias"" whereas they believe they would have reacted differently by magnitudes  had they been in my position.  I often just throw this down and get on with my life:  You are using the following epistemological fallacies & biases:  1.) Argument from Ignorance  ""I don't have more information therefore I can (incorrectly) assume""  2.) Personal Incredulity  ""I can't see it any other way due to my ignorance or lack of experience, therefore I believe I must be right""  3.) Exaggerated Personal Induction  ""All that matters is my own experience or what trusted people have told me. I am the center of the universe and  my imagination is greater than everyone else's reality""  4.) Dehumanization [Mixed with devaluation via stereotyping]  ""You lesser than me, therefore your pain is exaggerated.""  5.) Personal Optimism Bias  ""I would have done better. I know other's that have done better in other circumstances. Therefore you're weak, stupid or exaggerating""  6.) Bulverism  ""I can speak for you.

I know I had similar feelings when I was younger, unfortunately.  My best friend in college grew up with a single-mother and I found myself in the absurd position of being jealous of his trauma.  I suppose I have little sympathy for children of divorce or single parents because it's something I actively wished for as a child.  But saying, or even thinking: ""boy, I wish I had your problems"" when a friend is confiding in you is a pretty shitty thing.    I suppose the best way to look at ""common traumas"" is not from your own perspective, but from the perspective of the ideal life.  If someone had an otherwise perfect upbringing but was restricted from dating until they were in college, you could suggest: ""that's nothing! don't worry about it!"" but it might be more constructive to be understanding.  You could realize that such a inviolate rule could make them socially awkward, frightened of sex, ashamed of their sexuality and/or lack of experience, confused about their sexual orientation, and so on.  Certainly, it's not something that would cause PTSD, but it'd produce some hang-ups and acting-out in that person's adult life.

If they can acknowledge ""I had this smaller trauma and look how awful it was for me, my pain is valid. Look this person's was so much worse, that is unthinkable, since I feel mine was awful I think there's is even more awful"" then we are getting somewhere good. I mean let's say that their trauma was ten times smaller than yours and they insist on ten units of empathy, then I fair enough you should get a hundred units of empathy.

What I'm suggesting is that context, on both a social and macrobiological level, could be provided in order to act as a buffer and coping mechanism. If people are not provided with a large-world context in regards to the rewards and deterrents the rest of the world may face, they may hyper focus on their own trauma and possibly increase the damage or self sabotage out of despair (lacking alternative models). Personally I believe a larger context (not necessary a competitive-comparative context but rather a coordinate importance macrobiological/social comparative context) may actually bring comfort, unless the person is fixated on focusing on their trauma for self-importance or attention (histrionic), or as a part of a doomed attempt at introspective validation.

ptsd,3byjze,tpm_,2,Fri Jul 3 05:22:32 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I know what qualifies as a ""PTSD symptom,"" so I don't know how to answer your question.  What I identify as my PTSD symptoms are: hypervigilance, panic disorder, agoraphobia, depression, dissociation and anxiety.  Is this what you're talking about?  When I've quit (or attempted to quit) various addictive substances (caffeine, nicotine, alcohol), I've experienced withdrawal which can be uncomfortable and tends to increase my anxiety and shortens my temper, but otherwise I haven't noticed any particular increase in my ""PTSD symptoms.""  Lack of entertaining distractions (internet/TV/Movies/games) can put me into a bad mood as well, but that's mostly due to boredom, imo.  When I replace entertaining distractions with productive activities (exercise/art/reading/learning), my mood doesn't seem affected at all.  In fact, in some ways my mood is improved.  Try replacing bad habits with good ones.  I personally see nothing wrong with pot once in a while (every few weeks), but if you're self-medicating with opiates and pot frequently you might be better served with a more targeted medication.  Try to see a psychiatrist and if he prescribes an SSRI or SNRI, stay the fuck away from pot (I've read you can cause serotonin syndrome, which is potentially lethal-- ask your psychiatrist if you're not sure).  As for your behavioral addictions: I think you can probably easily replace them with productive activities that you enjoy just as much if not more.  Certainly, you can find more interesting and rewarding pursuits.  That said: I see nothing wrong with enough porn to masturbate a few times a week, enough sleep to be well-rested for your daily schedule, and enough internet to fulfill your news, information and entertainment needs."

I am new into my therapy so I don't really have a lot of resources. All I know is that you are disassociating yourself from the trauma. That right there is what is causing your flashbacks and nightmares, and utter dread when it comes to 'bed time'.   It sounds really hard to do, but you need to talk to your SO about Jan 12th. And I mean face to face, and in detail. You are basically going to have to relive what happened in order to understand it. It's something called En Vivo therapy. Its going to be ugly, and really hard and you might get really scared and you will cry a lot. BUT this is all part of the healing process. You say you dont remember much about that day, but you really do -- just your brain had decided to protect itself by not letting you think about it. Its a classic PTSD defense mechanism. You already said yourself you have signs of PTSD but I think you're beyond that. You're at a critical stage of it, especially if you cannot sleep and are having intense flash backs. I don't know where you live, but if its money issues, I can help you try to find some places near you that might have really cheap therapy. Personally, I have a sliding-scale office I visit, my sessions are hour long and only 5 dollars. Just let me know, I don't have too much to offer other than my words and maybe my google skills.

Last year reddit got pretty hostile towards people bitching about that, too (""Setting off random explosions in your general vicinity gives you anxiety attacks?

ptsd,3bs0wx,liminallime,2,Wed Jul 1 18:02:35 2015 UTC,"I'm finishing a cognitive processing therapy program which has been very helpful so far. It basically involves triggering myself thinking about things I'd rather avoid and writing them down, especially the worst/most haunting portions and reading it over and over. When there's a part you can't remember, put a line and add to it as you read over again if it comes back to you. This had been very hard and taken the better part of three months, I plan to take the course again. My therapist emphasizes just sitting and thinking about it is not enough because your thoughts can go a million directions and nothing much is accomplished. By writing down what happened and making sense of what I did, as well as understanding that what happened is a fact and there will never be answers to all the ""why"" and ""what if"" questions surrounding the situation I can understand how the fight/flight/freeze responses have helped keep me alive and functioning up till this point.   The other component is identifying ""stuck points"" and weighing the evidence for/against them. For instance, one of mine is that I am unloveable because of the things I have done. The evidence for this is that I am responsible for many civilian deaths. The evidence against is that I was acting under military orders with limited information, and had I not acted I would have faced jail time. There's a list of questions to ask yourself about whether you're including all the information in your belief (I am unloveable), whether you're jumping to conclusions, mind reading (everyone knows I'm a monster), etc.  I really resisted group treatment for a long time (decade +) because I didn't want to risk being vulnerable with strangers, but I have to tell you that being with others who really get it has been way more powerful than just sitting and talking with someone who gained their perspective from a bunch of books and other people's traumas/recoveries.   I'm sorry, and good luck! It's not easy but it's doable. Also, things like your avoidance will likely get worse before they get better, but if you accept that and keep working feeling better more often does happen."

I was reading this one book and the author had story after story of people that this has happened to.   It's also more common that you would think for abusive parents to take their kids in to therapists and get them diagnosed as a way of deflecting attention from the parents' own issues and abusiveness (many abusive parents will actually pre emptively do this as a way to discredit and control their kids). People have been doing this for over a hundred years when they want to ""control"" their kids or steal their money or for whatever ulterior motive. You take them to the therapist/psychiatrist and then they enforce your control and help you beat down your victim. It is often a very effective way of shutting people up.   I had no idea about this either. I thought that I was an anomaly but I found out that it had happened to so many people before me.

ptsd,3bmdct,kasira,2,Wed Jul 1 00:16:31 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's awful. The DBT world is full of trauma/abuse denying and a lot of abusive ideas. They have fought the trauma therapists and their ideas tooth and nail (mind you I don't think the trauma therapists are paragons of virtue). I remember watching Linehan in a video talking about how BPD women are misdiagnosed as CPTSD. So if you go to a DBT therapist who is following that school of thought and treating women with BPD and say you have CPTSD, they may be inclined to disbelieve you and think that it is BPD.   I actually do not think that DBT in itself is a bad therapy. I think it is helpful and tries to fix some of the dissociation and negative mindsets towards oneself and cognitive errors due to trauma. (For instance, from what I can see, mindfulness (which is one 1/4 of DBT) is basically encouraging people not to dissociate.) So presumably you could get a lot out of it. However I would be cautious because of the culture that it comes out of. I think that it can actually be effective and helpful but most therapists are steeped in the whole ""It's always an interaction. Both people caused the trauma"" school of thought where they refuse to acknowledge abuse and trauma.   They keep trying to see abuse as an ""interaction"" instead of calling it out as abuse. They think that is all relative and who is the abuser and who is the victim is relative. (This is not a good setup and is likely shaming to someone with PTSD). It might be some good skills to learn if you can find a DBT therapist that does not buy into the DBT way of thought. A DBT therapist is not likely to look at your PTSD as solely due to the trauma, they are not generally trauma therapists and that is not their way of looking at the world. They don't want to get political or talk about abuse and oppression. In fact Linehan mentions people whining about oppression in her book. It's dismissive."

I chose a therapist out of my insurance List and it was one of the worst experiences I've ever had in my life. Of course, out of all the times I've chosen out of my list this was particularly bad; other doctors have been okay. Recommendations from friends or local PTSD groups are more useful I think than reviews.  And I agree if there is anything that feels off in the first or second meeting don't continue. My previous therapist had a lot that was off but a lot that I connected with. I ignore the off for the connection. It was a really big mistake on my part. I actually ended up filing a state grievance against my therapist. It's the first time in 20 years of medical experiences that I've ever felt this way.   I can't stress enough if you feel worse when you leave that you did when you came in it's not good therapy.  Trust yourself no matter how unsure of your own feelings you are. Your gut will usually guide you better than your brain would,  at least in my experience. Good luck OP. A good therapist, which I have now, can make all the difference in the world. I wish I had found her 20 years ago. The irony is I had to go through something so awful to find someone so wonderful.   Edit: I also specifically look for someone who was certified in dealing with PTSD after the horrible therapy. It's ironic that I had to have that happen to me before I realize that PTSD was real in my life, prior to my therapy. Educate yourself as much as possible on PTSD and different treatments.

I know it felt terrible, but you did the right thing, the safe thing, in the middle of your flashback. That's something to be proud of.  For me, changing my environment is crucial. If I have a flashback indoors, I go outdoors. If I'm hot, I try to get cool. Changing and/or focusing on your physical environment may help you to snap back to the right place in time."

I can't imagine how frightening that must have been, but you did exactly what I would have wanted to do in such a situation. I'm really glad that you had someone with you at the time.  I know that when I have a flashback, I always feel ""off"" for a few days afterward. I usually experience a lot of hypervigilance, some derealization (anything from colors seeming to be more vivid than usual to not recognizing my body as my own), and just generally feel very emotionally fragile.  Practicing all of the self-care possible doesn't necessarily make me feel better, but it does help to remind me that I'm safe and present in the moment and no longer in the past."

Then it's a good motivation to keep working on your past until it gets a little easier. The meds can be nice but they can also lead to numbness and more problems as many of them will cause distinctions of other body systems, tolerance requiring heavier doses for a previous effect or even addiction. The therapy is the hard part to be honest. Ignoring/avoiding feelings by doing nothing or being a workaholic is common. There's no cure, but managing your symptoms and having appropriate outlets is definitely doable. Best wishes."

ptsd,3bk8q1,Pixiepup,2,Mon Jun 29 23:52:50 2015 UTC,"A range depending on symptoms, but typical of other disorders featuring those symptoms.   Sleep aids for insomnia, which unfortunately can retard growth in therapy by blocking dreams. Anxiolytics which are addictive. Antidepressants, a blood pressure medication which can help with nightmares. Mood stabilizers. St. John's wort is actually quite good as an antidepressant according to several psychiatrists I spoke to, but it has a very long list of drug interactions and possible side effects of its own so it wasn't for me, and I don't think you should take it without consulting a doctor."

ptsd,3bixbg,Wikipodiatrist,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:07:51 2015 UTC,"My psychiatrist just prescribed me Effexor because I reacted so poorly to Paxil's side-effects (two ER visits and 4 panic attacks in 6 days).  I read up on Effexor and patient reviews online are FULL of scary stories, especially about withdrawal.  There was one story of someone that went into serotonin syndrome when he combined pot with Effexor (I think it was 300mg and three puffs off a joint for him).  How's your experience?  Based on your experience, are the stories online just outliers?  How long have you been on it?  Have you talked to your doctor about interactions between pot and SSRI/SNRIs?  Have you been tracking your blood pressure and how's that going?  I was also prescribed Prazosin (to counteract Effexor's potential bloodpressure and nightmare side-effects), did your doctor do the same for you?  Did it help?"
ptsd,3bixbg,Cthulusuppe,2,Fri Jul 3 11:27:22 2015 UTC,"I smoke fairly often on Effexor and it hasn't really given me problems. I've been on it a few months and my doctor knows I smoke; she never warned me about that other than the standard dr speak about not doing drugs. I'll ask specifically about what you say when I see her next. She takes my blood pressure regularly because I'm also on Intuniv for concentration and so far it's perfect. I occasionally get a little dizzy on standing and tend to walk a little more slowly. My nightmares are under control so I'm not on anything for those. However the one day I missed a dose of Effexor I had some mild nightmares. She warned me withdrawals are possible.    Overall, it's helping me enough to keep me coming back for refills but it's not the most benign medication. If your doc recommends it, I'd give it a shot. But I wouldn't stop without his or her supervision either."
ptsd,3bixbg,Wikipodiatrist,2,Sat Jul 4 06:25:05 2015 UTC,"I looked into it a bit more.  Marijuana doesn't produce or interact with serotonin (it interacts with other stuff in the brain), so the serotonin syndrome story I read online was either a fabrication, or totally due to Effexor and the pot was coincidence.

While I'm still trying to figure out what anti-depressant works, as I just recently switched from Zoloft to lexapro, I can tell you that I've tried klonopin and Xanax, both in their lowest doses, and I find that I like klonopin better. You can get it as a dissolvable, great when I'm super panicky, and it doesn't make me loopy like Xanax. Also, depending on your state's legalization, I've taken to one to two hits of MJ when I have the physical symptoms creeping up or being intense, and it helps me get through the day without being too derp. My doctor is not supportive of this, but will easily give me a prescription for benzos, so I'm looking for a new, more progressive doctor :)"

I definitely wasn't capable of working and still have trouble in my old field. Klonopin was definitely my last-resort, last chance at calming down option. When my regular prescription couldn't pull me out of an oncoming rage, I would take one and it would calm my racing heart, tensing muscles and that adrenaline response in my limbs.  I would recommend looking into or speaking with domestic abuse resources in your city. They are trying to draw more attention to PTSD in foster children and children of abuse. I am in the same boat as you, there, as well. I do not have combat-related PTSD.  I'm really sorry you're in this situation."
ptsd,3bgpsj,justlurkingaround1,10,Mon Jun 29 01:58:51 2015 UTC,"From what I've been told, this is from the flight fight or freeze reaction. If a bear is stalking you, you will be more concerned about survival in that moment than eating. Your body shuts things like digestion down so it can use the energy for fighting or flighting.   Food was used and taken away as a power play on me as a kid so I have eating issues as well from that. The only things I've found that help are taking small portions and forcing myself to eat three bites. I can wrap it up for later if I still don't want it after those three bites.   Most of the time, it kicks in the hunger feeling. I would happily never eat again but my god once I have a bite or two I usually tear it up.   I also have instant breakfast on hand, and allow myself to have that instead of a meal sometimes. If I'm actively triggered or in panic mode, I don't bother trying until after I've calmed down a bit. Eating when in panic mode feels like a brick in my stomach, I've tried forcing it. Three bites never hurt though!"

My PTSD has been from childhood and although I was classified as ""looks like a Bergen-Belsen survivor"" by doctors, my mother/nuns decided food deprivation was a good tool. I learnt to get by without food by about 6yrs old...but then learning to eat decently became a chore.  If I'm anxious (like today) I got a muesli bar down...and it stayed down. If i force it, i will vomit.  In stress, i can't enjoy eating for the taste, it becomes an inner battle...which results in more stress. complimented with horrific allergies...it seems hopeless at times. I try to have lots of tasty stuff to hand (waste a lot of food/$) because if what I want isn't to hand i just say ""well, thats what I want and I dont have it...so I won't eat"" It's so easy not to eat (my 1 muesli bar has done me over 36 hours so far).  Tomorrow, I'll start up my recovery deal. Make a very nice sandwich and cut it into 4/6 pieces...for every piece I keep down, i get a small reward each day. By the end of the week I should be back to 2 meals a day...slow build.

ptsd,3bgpsj,friendshipfailed,3,Mon Jun 29 04:20:48 2015 UTC,"Yes, not eating is one of my typical responses to triggers and PTSD symptoms.  Sometimes smoothies are a little easier to get down and cause less nausea than solid food, but that's only sometimes.  Hot showers and bike rides can help with my anxiety and help me eat because of that, but again, only sometimes.  Having a history of disordered eating (probably as a response to trauma, imho) certainly doesn't help.  Sometimes I don't sleep either.  I wish I had better advice about how to handle loss of appetite/nausea;  I'm still working on finding a good coping mechanism for that.  You're not alone though.  I've experienced domestic violence as well.  It troubles me that you say your husband has ""almost"" completely fixed his problems.  Living with the source of trauma can be really difficult, even if the person is actively trying to change their behaviour.  Do you have a therapist, a supportive friend or family member, or somewhere you can go when you're feeling triggered or unsafe?"
ptsd,3bgpsj,LivingInFearPTSDgirl,2,Mon Jun 29 13:32:00 2015 UTC,"You're spot-on about smoothies and hot showers. I can't bring myself to exercise when I'm anxious, but I can see why that would be helpful. As for things sometimes working and sometimes not, I get that too. Coping skills are pretty beneficial when my anxiety is just starting, but if I let it get out of hand, there's not much that can be done.  I should clarify about my husband. He has bipolar, so when I say that his problems are almost fixed, I mean that he's non-violent and not abusive. He occasionally says some hurtful things and has bouts of moodiness, but there's really no comparison to how things used to be. Ninety-nine percent of the time, he's paying very close attention to his behavior and actions and I do feel safe.

ptsd,3bgpsj,reasonweb,3,Mon Jun 29 22:24:28 2015 UTC,"I do. I can't even think about eating and I don't think it has anything to do with my, not wanting to eat to have some control in my life, type of thing. It is amazing, almost identical to a lot of what is written here. If I am made to eat, I guess the hunger will kick in and I can eat. It also helps that the majority of the time, someone that I know loves me and cares for me makes me eat. Because it comes from him and I trust him, I guess I relax a bit and maybe the trigger responses give way to the safety I feel with him. I don't know if that makes sense, I'm having a bad day, but I am experiencing this post subject this morning and wanted to reply because I was surprised there were more people experiencing this as well. You hear a lot about stress eating, but not as much about this kind of non-appetite thing. If that makes sense."

They'd try to classify me as anorexic. I wanted to scream at them ""I WANT TO EAT, BUT I CAN'T!!""   Smoothies have saved me. I mix an Ensure with some greens powder and a bunch of frozen fruit and drink one of those a day. If I can manage that, I can usually manage to eat fairly regularly.

I've told people before that mocking ""triggers"" and making fun of ""pathetic babies who need trigger warnings"" is cruel and nasty, especially for those of us with PTSD.  But too often they just start ranting about how they're ""not like that"" they ""support ptsd sufferers"" and it's ""-insert group here- that are making fun of trigger warnings"".  I've cut a lot of ties over that."

But I have two exceptions to that.   1) People who know me well and have seen what happens when something triggers me. If they continue to make fun of triggers (anyones triggers, not just mine) after having a talk with them about it and witnessing my struggle, I cut ties with them. It's unfortunate, but necessary.  2) People who have PTSD themselves and make fun of other people's triggers. I have zero patience with this."
ptsd,3b9wsb,RadleyCoopSound,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:30:37 2015 UTC,"True, I think it usually comes from a place of ignorance about it and not being aware that triggers are a serious thing. To an outsider they probably just see it thrown around on tumblr and find the idea stupid."

ptsd,3b9wsb,bblemonade,3,Sat Jun 27 16:05:30 2015 UTC,"I had a sibling that used to trigger me on purpose and then would bully me and taunt me, calling my responses ""spazzing."" He would encourage others to do the same, and every once in a while they would oblige if they thought we were alone as a group. This happened everyday on the school bus for a year, and increased in boarding school.  I also had a ""friend"" that would do the same, but would call it ""being bipolar"" or ""going skitzo"", and would often tell me to ""get the sand out"" of my ""mangina"".  My (then) abusive foster mother used to do the same and tried to get me institutionalized for nonsensical reasons when I was a child. The hospital staff watched her through a two way mirror however and refused to commit me. They noted she was controlling and abusive, but didn't call child protective services.  Often people laugh when I ask them not to bully me or tear me down and project thoughts and feelings on me (bulverism). They then lecture me. I've given up socializing and I've become antisocial. My brain is done."

I have found myself being quiet about my triggers because it's become such a huge joke that I don't feel I'll be taken seriously, or I have to find a different way to say it without using the word ""trigger"" even though that's literally the word for it. Even trying to explain it in terms of ""this will give me a panic attack"" is hard because that's said sarcastically all the time too, like when people jokingly say they have OCD, or worse, think they do because they're tidier than others or some other bullshit."

ptsd,3bbood,05Anonymouse,3,Sat Jun 27 18:07:04 2015 UTC,"[If my post seems disjointed it's because I haven't slept. I apologize.]  I spoke about this in the ""Victim blaming, exploitation and derision by mental health professionals"" thread.  most of my therapists, social workers, etc... have used logical fallacies and cognitive biases to justify abuse or shift the blame. I was misdiagnosed with ADHD when I was a child for reasons everyone (now) admits were bogus. After 7 years of segregation, forced mediations and bullying, I developed PTSD, but was misdiagnosed 6 other times and victim blamed again. I believe it's people's natural inclination to see if they can interpret evidence to fit previous accusations. This persistent behavior pushed me down distrusting people and fearing interactions with people. I would say the uneasiness that people feel at first disclosing information to others, especially therapists, is actually founded upon rational concepts. Personally I think it will be a long time before epistemology is introduced to the field, since intuition and stereotyping seem to be coveted practices within the study. I can't tell you have many times I've been awestruck at college educated professionals using blatant fallacies to victim blame or manipulate me. The sad part is, even though it's blatant (meaning they persisted even after I tried to correct them), I'm not sure it's deliberate, as they usually refuse to even look up the terms I've spoken of, and instead use the ""let's focus on you"" line, even though correcting false accusations would have been an important part of that. In my life time, the only professional that ever had a positive effect on my life was a social worker that had at one point been a psychotherapeutic client and a social service client, and appreciated the amount of time I took to educate myself on logical fallacies and cognitive biases. At this point I have diagnosed PTSD with depression, but have also diagnosed myself with severe antisocial traits due to prolonged psychological abuse and systemic oppression (segregation, forcing me into programs to secure their funding, scapegoating, etc.). I even went into a behavioral suicide clinic for my PTSD and came out 10X worse than when I went in. Superiority complexes and accusations run wild in the system. That's why I opted out before I went completely overboard."

I had a bad experience with a couple therapists and a psychologist, they blamed me for my PTSD saying I wasn't trying hard enough or that it was my fault I was abused. I chose to not mention it to my therapist so that they could make their own decisions. I'm currently not in therapy or seeing a psychiatrist mostly because therapy wasn't working for me and my psychiatrist was frustrated I wasn't responding to medication and blamed me. So I only see a medical doctor for my anti-depressants, he's much more willing to keep trying to find the right medication. You don't have to share your past with new doctors."

ptsd,3bbood,cdooginz,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:21:57 2015 UTC,"My point isn't about doctors but therapists, whom are usually social workers, not doctors, and hold no such degree. Nor should they be respected as such. That just encourages false faith in their education and promotes the Dunning Kruger effect.  I think there's a mental health culture problem within the system itself, as undermining patients self confidence (in their self awareness) seems to be common practice (I've been in the system for over 25 years), but appears to be done as part of an  earnest effort to convince the patient they have a stereotypical problem from a stereotypical point of view. I've seen dozens of therapists and dozens of LCSWs, and they seem to be instructed to stereotype and project on clients. The actual doctors, the psychiatrists have been willing to listen to me, but tell me they have to reply on what the therapist tell them my diagnosis is. I've only seen psychiatrists in conjunction with therapists (although I've seen psychiatric nurses alone, and there's a whole 'nother ""mental health culture"" problem of Dunning Kruger proportions all together, at least in the places I've been  [Detroit, NYC, Chicago, Los Angeles]).  Yes, if people are having issues so bad they need to see a doctor, then of course see a doctor. But if the culture isn't one of healing or helping the patient, then leave the culture and seek help elsewhere. Perhaps another set of doctors in a better social climate."

I agree that a lot of professionals minimize people's own perceptions of their mental problems (the old round-about logic that is: ""well since you have mental problems, you clearly do not know what your mental problems are, because you have mental problems"").  But I've had a very different experience from the OP and you, not in the fact that all of my professional help has been good (far, far from it) but because I've always been able to find some good professional help amongst the wreckage that is the health care system (in the U.S.)"
ptsd,3basyy,LydiaColton,4,Sat Jun 27 12:46:38 2015 UTC,"The symptoms of PTSD is not completely identical in everyone that has it.   Some people avoid their trauma, some are consumed by it.  Some people become quiet/withdrawn, some become angry/irritable etc.    I think it's awesome that you're getting less flashbacks. They are very hard to deal with.   I don't think there's anything healing about them at all, I wish I could make it go away. when I get them, I get tense, chest hurts, heart races, I feel sick and panicked...feels like the past is happening right now.

As with any mental illness there are diagnostic criteria, but beyond that symptoms can present themselves in many ways or not at all. Some people can go decades before experiencing a flashback.  I myself have only experienced a flashback once, and it was actually triggered while reading another user's post on this forum that struck a little too close for comfort.  Most of what I deal with on a daily basis are panic symptoms and disassociation. These two coupled up make for some very uncomfortable experiences, like being in a state of distress but having no understanding or ability to understand or control the extreme discomfort or what caused it. I am also meticulous when it comes to compartmentalisation - and that's a really foul problem of mine as it affects everything in my personal life.  One thing that does bother me, though, is that the years where I suffered my trauma are some of the foggiest. I know the clinical details of each event, but if I had to try to go back there and recall them step by step it's difficult, like trying to watch the television through frosted glass. I also feel completely disconnected from my childhood self, as though that kid's a whole other person. In fact I am so disconnected from the childhood version of myself that I went about making sure very few photos stood the test of time. (My father actually came to me not long ago with photos from the late 80s and early 90s of me - the very last ones left. I don't think I've ever faked a smile quite like that one.)"
ptsd,3basyy,vanityobscene,2,Sun Jun 28 09:52:46 2015 UTC,"I think that it is completely individual and case specific.  For a long time I had zero flashbacks or real memories of the time that my trauma occurred.  Any time I tried to think of it, it seemed like my brain would immediately block it out.  Now, after years of therapy and learning to cope, I have been having increased flashbacks/memories resurfacing.  I have become very comfortable with my therapist and find it easier to start talking about my trauma.  For me, I think that digging into these feelings have caused me to have an increase in flashbacks.  But, before when I only focused on symptom management and coping skills, I rarely had flashbacks as I am now.  I think that the amount of flashbacks is individual and potentially related to how much you want to bring up the trauma.  It's an interesting thing to think about. I would not be concerned if I were you about the amount you are having, just focus on yourself and feeling better, it's a very personal disorder.  Best wishes to you :)"

I also did not leave the hospital, I slept there, only went home to change clothes and shower, and then she came to my house for hospice, I had been given time off at work and vacation time and the first day I went back to work, when I got home she passed away.  I went on and I thought everything was OK, but I didn't realize how much this hurt me and I wasn't seeking help because I didn't know, and out nowhere an ulcer ripped my stomach open, had my stomach cut from sternum to pelvis in emergency surgery, lost my job because I left work from the pain the ulcer was causing and all that compounded into me becoming severely depressed and now 7 years later I am still working through it.    You seem to be on the right path, I wish I would have been seeking help as you are to prevent things from getting to bad.

ptsd,3b9dua,carol78,1 point,Sat Jun 27 09:32:19 2015 UTC,"You cant run away or forget your parents and their suffering so therapy is the best way to deal with it.  I advice ACT(Acceptance and commitment therapy). IN ACT, clients develop mindfulness skills , (both traditional techniques, and many modern, innovative ones) which enable them to fundamentally change their relationship with painful thoughts and feelings.   When clients practice these skills in everyday life, painful feelings and unhelpful thoughts have much less impact and influence over them. Therefore, instead of wasting their time and energy in a fruitless battle with their inner experiences, they can invest their energy in taking action to change their life for the better -  guided by their deepest values.

Every major milestone in my life, every situation where a young woman might turn to her mother for guidance or support, I'm reminded that I'll never have it. People tell me that eventually thinking about her won't be painful, but I don't believe them.   What helps me is doing things explicitly in her memory. I used to write my mom a letter every year updating her on what's happened with me. Some people like to write letters and then tie them to a balloon and let it float away.   It helps to talk about it too. Not necessarily with a therapist, if you have a really good friend who doesn't mind just sitting and listening to you talk it might work just as well. Traumatic memories are encoded differently than normal ones, which is why they stick around so long and seem just as intense 10 years later; talking through it can help integrate the trauma into our life story.   The most important thing for me though was to stop trying to avoid the grief. Like you I wished for a long time that I could just forget about it. When I felt sad or angry or small I tried to push the feelings away, and got even more upset (with myself) when I couldn't. Now when I am sad, I console myself, I let myself sob and rock and miss her. I talk to the lost little girl inside and tell her it will be OK. It may sound crazy but I actually feel better sooner than if I try to stuff the feeling down.   I'm so sorry for your losses. I hope you find peace soon"

I'm trying to continuously remind myself that it has only been 3.5 years and I'm doing better than I would have ever thought possible 3.5 years ago.

All of it is awesome, terrifying, beautiful, and incredibly interesting. Sometimes I feel that same awe for everything can effectively stop somebody from relating to me though. For example when something horrible happens to me I often start laughing, which seems like the wrong reaction to most people, because of the vastness of our universe and how silly and absurd it seems that in a moment I'm consumed by something so relatively small. Sometimes I'm laughing at something awful happening because of how awful it seems to others, and in comparison to all those things that have already happened it is like a papercut is to a bullet wound, minor and insignificant in my perspective even if it still stings."

I'm so worthless/I deserved everything/why am I even living then I noticed it was it was raining outside started thinking about why I like the rain.   I also try to so one thing a day that I like, even when I hate everything and have no motivation but by the end of whatever it is, I always feel a bit better and like I accomplished something even if I've spent the rest of the day in bed.

DBT (Dialectical Behavioral Therapy) helps a lot.  Originally designed for Borderline Persinality Disorder, this amazing mishmash of other therapies and philosophies has also been  found to help many things including other personality disorders, adhd, ptsd..  Weekly group for at least a year.   It never goes away but you learn tools to cope without always crumbling.   A therapist who knows DBT is great too, but Groups Are Key Becsuse YOU Learn from individuals WHO might HAVE your Particular Symptoms What Works AND what doesn't for them, as well as types.  Distress tolerance and emotional regulation modules are huge help.  For me... cognitive therapy and no other types have helped 20 years of trying other types off and on with various therapists.  But DBT did.  But you MUST stick with it at least a year."

You will be you again, maybe not the same exactly and with a tremendous effort on your part, but healing is definitely possible. It is hard, but the biggest thing that can help is gradually building a supportive network - face to face is preferable as the internet is a poor substitute and there are a lot of sadistic predatory types around waiting to take advantage of your condition. If you encounter them, it will likely set back your recovery.  Try to get back into doing the things you enjoy, little by little to your level of tolerance. Baby steps - go outside for fresh air for as long as you can stand it, soak up some sun (that helps depression). The more you do, the easier it will be to do more. Look at it like goals and start with those that are easiest to attain - each time you do, your confidence and self-esteem gets stronger.

Go on Amazon and look at books on PTSD, look at the reviews people leave to see if it's worth reading then go find a library that has it, or buy it. Can you afford therapy? Do you have health insurance?   You will get through this. You will find yourself again.   Also, check out MeetUp.com  Check and see if there are any support groups in your area that deal with PTSD.

Even sociopaths can be said to be ignorant in a way, they just don't have the mental capacity to feel the way other people do, but what they do is still evil.

The events don't change but your reactions to them do.     Under the circumstances, it sounds like you're doing great. You probably won't  forget what happened to you, and that's good in some ways, because it keeps you safe.

On the first morning I was there, I was pulled from bed at five AM, still very woozy from a new Depakote / Trazodone prescription, and brought into a tiny room to be examined by one of the doctors. He checked my temperature and reflexes, used a stethoscope normally, and then without explanation he put his hand underneath my gown and took hold of my left breast. He just fucking sat there like that for what felt like forever, as I gradually turned red. There was a nurse in the room with him, I couldn't see what she was doing but she wasn't doing shit about that.   It seemed like a fucking eternity but finally he let me go and I was dismissed to go lie down again. I didn't say shit, because I knew fucking well I was the mental patient and no one was going to believe me. It was really, really infuriating and it still is  edit: I've removed references to his suspended license for unrelated shenanigans re: unnecessary injections, because it identified him personally and if I'm going to take him up, I'll take him up in the right way. But I should say that part of the vivacious miscellany of psychiatric disorders that landed me in that place in the first place was traceable to an abusive stepfather that started his rampage across my tattered innocence by shoving his hand under my shirt at every opportunity in my late childhood.

The bad part is that even thought they have terrible reviews, they're one of highest banking hospitals in my area. The whole systems messed up as far as hospitals go.

She was my doctor at an intensive inpatient programme (apparently the psych ward here is too hard on people with severe PTSD- go figure). I loathe this woman. I would say a very simple thing about my feelings, and she would immediately twist it into something violent and totally not what i said. This wasnt her  trying to push my buttons: she was serious. It got to the point where i talked as little as possible and, when she did do that, i would say ""what even... no?? I didnt say anything like that?  I meant exactly what I said. I do choose my words for a reason."" I am a very very respectful person but damn she drove me crazy. She also refused to give me a sure-fire diagnoses. I could go on about this lady.

I've suffered a good bit of abuse from mental health staff, but most recently I spent a few months on the psychiatric floor of a nursing home. It was locked, we couldn't leave even to go to another floor. Terrible shit went down there. I mean, no hot water, violent patients in general pop, severe neglect, Medicare fraud, theft, you name it. I knew as soon as I set foot in that place I didn't belong there, but the referring hospital had lied and told me they were sending me to rehab. Getting myself out of there and having somewhere to go when I left was a logistical nightmare, since they kept refusing to take me to apply and interview for housing and jobs.  The worst part, though, was that shortly before I left, one patient attacked another in the cafeteria. He choked him so hard there was visible bruising. But the police were never called, the attacker was kept in the general population, and I was too scared to speak up about it in case it put my plans to leave in jeopardy.  I have mostly given up on traditional mental health treatment and I'm working on recovery on my own now. I like my way better. It's so much less dehumanizing :\"

Research that if you want, you'll see you're not alone.  I lucked out with one of my therapists. She acknowledged that some of my symptoms did sound like PTSD (emotional numbing, flashbacks), but the psychiatrist didn't. He was determined to think it was ""mildly bi-polar II"" or ""mood disorder NOS"" due to severe insomnia and intense energy levels during those times. However, there is a gov article that shows how common it is to misdiagnose and get PTSD hyper-arousal/anxious states confused with the hypomanic states of bi-polar II.   That's a bit different from your experiences though.

I explained to her I had experienced sexual, physical, emotional and institutional abuse, and the labels and stigma were by far the most damaging in regards to my recovery. She waved her hands and couldn't stop laughing... in front of my social worker (who didn't even move the entire time we were there, he was just obsessed and fixated on getting paperwork, even illegitimate paperwork) and my social support. My social support later spoke about the experience in a recorded Skype call (yes he consented).  When I reported bullying in school, I was often victim blamed and sent to the schools child therapist. I interrupted and accused of having thoughts I didn't have. When I disagreed with them (first a she then a he), they would doubt me, and then tell me I was lying. About my own personal thoughts. When I was scapegoated by peers or attacked (targeted due to previous labels and being a maladapted foster child), I was blamed by the child therapists.  My last therapist ignored my complaints about psychological abuse by other people in her field, shifted the blame to my foster parents (my foster parents shift the blame of their abuse to professional misguidance... neither out rightly deny their abuse), continually interrupted me, accused me of having thoughts I didn't have (""bulverism""), dismissed my beliefs that I could do well if I was given a normal opportunity (common),  and told me I need to be taken off benefits because it's a drain on the state (I'm on congruent which tax benefits, its from my foster parents social security and my own account).  One that really stands out, but isn't rather outright abusive was when I was in a therapy art class and was told my ""shitty ass white boy artwork"" was ""demonic"", and I was accosted by other people in the therapy session. When I complained, I was told to drop it by the director of social services. The other clients continued their intimidate, and when I spoke about it again to the staff, I was asked to leave. The following months I was treated as if I was distrustful. The same social service director (and my case worker) ended up getting angry at me, belittling me, and blaming me for their refusal to fix a toilet their construction crew (building was partially rehabbed) had dumped drywall in 6 months prior. This person has ""Social Justice For ALL"" as his mantra on all of his social media, and refuses to speak to me because I outed him and my social worker online after they refused to correct their mistake and blamed me for it. [I have IBS and was forced to run down the block to the McDonalds or go in the alley for 6 months. When the building manager offered to fix it anyway, the director intervened and said all repairs must go through them. I still have that email.]  The most common example is when safety-net workers engage in 'diagnostic fishing"" or ""blame-fishing"", where they project in order to quickly diagnose or dismiss. When I tell them they are incorrect, they engage in argument from ignorance fallacy or personal incredulity fallacies. I am told that if I can't explain why people have done me wrong, then I am either wrong or lying. ...because I am honest and do not pretend to read people's minds. I find requesting [false] accusations immature, intellectually fraudulent and unethical. On top of that  I am usually pressured to join programs and coerced to see how many labels I can get to ""help"" them with their statistics and funding. None of the interactions have been about healing, encouraging will, or leaving the system."

ptsd,3b22uo,startingoverin2015,2,Thu Jun 25 12:07:52 2015 UTC,"Do you have health insurance? It sounds like you are stuck in a system that relies on patient  volume to retain funding and doesn't have competitive salaries to attract qualified professionals. Sadly, getting actual treatment in the USA depends on your insurance.  I have heard awful stories about how some facilities treat their patients. Therapists are people too, and some people are assholes. Facilities with high volume and little oversight seem attract them."
ptsd,3b22uo,VideoSpellen,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:00:01 2015 UTC,"I'm on an HMO plan, but they're just acting as my State provider since I'm on disability. I've noticed that people get treated differently depending on their insurance, and I've always thought that it was odd... money may effect access, but it shouldn't effect the same providers attitude (IMHO). I think the current cultural/social climate may have something to do with such reactions as well (different people of different classes being treated differently). I typed out a long explanation of my theory that, but decided to save it rather than post it because I think it's  too long."
ptsd,3b22uo,VideoSpellen,2,Thu Jun 25 13:19:40 2015 UTC,"Facilities choose which insurance plans they will accept. Poor people have cheaper insurance, which are cheaper because they cover fewer/less services. Accepting patients with these plans increases the facility's risk of not being reimbursed by the insurance company or the patient and having to eat the cost. Therefore, many facilities who provide services that are either in high demand (e.g. experienced specialists) or are contained in a small practice (e.g. private mental health clinics) do not take cheap insurance. Instead, they take a certain number of reduced cost pro bono cases each year to keep things predictable.   This means that your insurance coverage can significantly impact the quality of mental health services you see. In some large facilities, the unpredictable cost of nonpayment/nonreimbursment are controlled by reducing payroll expenses. This can mean hiring people who have less experience or a less competitive training background, and therefore can't negotiate for a higher salary somewhere else. In mental health, income is generated by patient contact hours. So these employees are then expected to see a LOT of patients to buffer unexpected  costs. Finally, guess who has cheaper insurance? Sicker people. Unemployment and financial decline are a common symptom of serious mental health conditions.   So you get this perfect storm of overworked/stressed out people without the proper experience or qualifications to treat the most challenging and complicated cases.   It is possible that the providers you have seen just aren't equipped to handle your case. PTSD is an especially heterogeneous and poorly understood condition. Even more so when a patient has comorbid medical conditions, chronic pain, TBI or  just financial or family stress. It can stump even experienced doctors and therapists.  I would highly recommend that you research clinics/profesionals in your area that specialise in an your specific concerns. Call them and see if they have a sliding scale program or if they take pro bono cases, assuming they don't take your insurance."

It was not always an immediate relief after a session. Sometimes after a particularly revealing hour I float for a few days or cry or need a long walk or a nap. And then I think back on that moment a few weeks later and it's better. Not so messy and explosive inside me.   As to being comfortable with my therapist's reaction- I have learned to say out loud ""the look on your face makes me think..."" or ""I don't think I like the way you asked me that question"". Expressing my discomfort has lead to some of our best discoveries.   Just my two cents worth. Hope your experience goes well. It's not a straight line, but it can be a fun ride."

I have one now that wants to take each and every thing or event or situation, whatever, and talk about it in extreme detail over and over and process the fear and feelings etc from it. I am terrified. I have only talked to one other person about these things and I trust him with my life, literally. I've been avoiding doing it and stalling and he knows and is pushing me to get moving. I don't feel ready, but I can't stay this way. I'm trapped and feel like I don't have a choice, which is triggering in itself. I don't know what to do. It's like how they try to make sure you are healthy before undergoing surgery.

You could tell your therapist what you just wrote or write more things like it and just give it to them if it's too hard.

I remembered something and had a flashback and my therapist didn't 'save me' from it. I was so pissed at him.  So I felt like I had to play a million hours of video games and not sleep, eat or shower. But that was worse, the numb, because it takes away all the good feelings too, like food. So I told him I didn't want to talk anymore, that I was angry. I told him I needed him to step in and pull me out of it because I couldn't do it myself, and he didn't do that. But then he said okay, we can do that if it happens again and all I need to do is raise my hand and he would step in.  The advice... talking about the horrible things doesn't mean you have to let go of what makes you feel safe. Suppressing and detaching is not productive coping but you can replace those with stuff like grounding and relaxation techniques (which for me was really strange and hard to do at first, but they turned out to be useful) That way you can experience the emotion but know you have a way to bring yourself back to the present if it gets too much. And you can always tell your therapist you want to stop."

In the beginning I found a way to talk but not really talk. I gave an outline, the pieces that had most often gone through my mind. 'He did something bad. I was dating him. His mother was just as bad. He was crazy. She was crazy.' After awhile I added what I felt about those memories. 'I hate the idea that I let this happen, that I couldn't stop it happening, that I wanted it to happen. That I didn't run away.' My therapist asked questions and I gradually found more pieces, more things to say.  Seeing how my therapist responds... I don't always like hearing a different take on it (he says my abuser was delusional, I thought he meant 'unaware of what he was doing' when he was really talking about the clinical definition, like what it says on wiki). But yeah, it is fucking hard. I cry or don't feel anything at all. I forget everything or remember too much all at once. I argue with my therapist and think he is an unfeeling wall of apathy. Then I keep talking about it, about myself and what happened, and about why I hate therapy. And my therapist tries to keep up, asks questions and explains himself when I ask him questions so I guess its okay.  (Edited: For clarity, because apparently 3am is not kind to syntax)"

Mostly, it makes me feel less ashamed.  This has all been very helpful to me.  This is what I did, and I recommend it for you too:  Write it down. Write down the events, what happened, in as much detail as you would like, and write down how you felt in the moment that it happened. Not how you feel right now looking back at it, but how you felt in the moment itself.  Write as much detail as is stuck inside your head.    Then read it to someone you trust, like your therapist.    I would not have been able to talk about it if I had not written it first and then read it.

Psychiatrist, medications as prescribed, psychotherapy. Reduce stress,   minimize bills,   be around supportive folks.  Exercise, meditation, eat & sleep healthy.   so far.. check, check, check.. you're doing most of this.   My own stuff -  I like to learn new stuff, so I read and get engaged with online classes.   (short - less committment, so if I flake I don't feel like I failed.)  I have control issues with most of my traumas.   Authorities lied to me,  put me in no-win situations,  I had little or no control over the shitstorms that turned out.. but they pinned blame on me, and I accepted some blame internally.  .. so I actively try to control everything around me,  making lists, changing appointments, checking my bills to the penny.. virtually OCD about it.  I change locks frequently, especially if I can pick them quickly.    I modify door & window frames for added security.   When I go out I drive,  I pick a route and an alternate.  I map fire/escape routes in friends houses, restaurants, and stadiums.    I call in advance and make any arrangements I can, I speak with local police or security.  Does it make me look nuts?  possibly.   But - I'm getting out of the house again, and I'm able to participate in things like crowded concerts that I couldn't do for a lot of time.   I found that TV pretty much sucks my life out.   I stopped cable.   I do have Netflix, and local Digital TV through antenna.  I'm contemplating HBO.. but not just yet.   I have a nice quiet corner of the library staked out,  where I can read the newspapers and magazines.    I avoid the daily news - too much violence both in print and on TV.. most of it isn't local and won't really affect my life.   The big stuff nationally - I'll hear on the radio or podcasts;   the local stuff, someone will talk to me about it soon enough.   Good luck.. I hope some of this stuff gives you at least an idea.   edit:  PS.. I re-read that, and some might come off as if I was in military or combat for trauma.   I wasn't.   I was in a couple of law enforcement and government orgs, among other stuff.  I dealt with a lot of trauma, and thought nothing of it until the last few incidents when I didn't recover.   Now I look at all of them, especially in self-reflection and in therapy.   Generally I mean ""authorities"" as anyone from parents, teachers, superiors, bosses, etc."

ptsd,3azsit,playswithdogs,3,Wed Jun 24 23:51:47 2015 UTC,"You've got a great start with the running thing. IIRC, endorphins have a half life of 36 hours? I run every other day. Sometimes it's like pulling teeth to get me out of bed to do so, but it's always worth it.   Keep finding simple things you know you enjoy—because you enjoy them, not to fill the time. Filling time does just that—for me, it distracted me and made time go by faster, but when I started to find enjoyable things, it did fill time, but it also allowed me to be more mentally/emotionally present. It was important for me to reteach myself that reality can be enjoyable, and that I don't need to stay mentally checked out. I'm a vocalist, and I always forget how much better I start to feel when I sing...stuff like that. Find your self-care niche and go to town.  There was another problem: I could enjoy myself doing these things, but as soon as I stopped, the bad feelings came back like a tide. I can't always be doing something, so I've also learned to try and ""transcend"" whatever bad feelings I have at the moment. It doesn't usually take away the feelings, but for some reason it doesn't torment me as badly. I've been keyed up or anxious and thought, ""Why? What's happening—oh ok, my amygdala is fucking with me right now."" Recognizing it helps me to not let it have control, and cues me to do whatever coping skill is suitable at the moment. I've likened it to being a chronic pain patient, in that I would have established the source of the pain (and not raise an alarm every time), and the knowledge of what to do about it and draw the line at my limitations.  Hopefully you get on some good, working meds right off the bat. It'll take weeks to kick in but I couldn't be more grateful than that higher level of functioning. I still have to work at the issues myself, but it caused me to be able to actually defeat them most of the time.  I can't speak to panic attacks, flashbacks or any other involuntary overwhelming thing because my case is more dissociation-based so I don't have them. I do have nightmares, though, and I take Prazosin for it.   Best of luck to you."
ptsd,3azsit,macaronisalad,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:08:29 2015 UTC,"Meditation.  I do non-directive meditation, so I just lie still and let my mind wander, but I try to slow it down.  I try to listen to the sounds around me and just focus on how my body feels and what sounds I hear without thinking about how my body feels and what the sounds are.  The reason I started doing this, and so far it has worked, is to help process trauma. I read somewhere that meditation helps evoke flashbacks and helps process trauma and dredge up memories.  The reason behind this is that meditation slows down the activity in the amygdala, which is a lot to blame for the suppression and repression of trauma.  Simultaneously, meditation ramps up the activity in the hippocampus and thalamus, where memories are stored and processed.  (can't find source, was on the internet). The commenters who recommended MDMA or LSD, I agree with them if you can do a controlled study, but due to potential risks and unstudied effects of street use, I would say no to doing it yourself.  Interestingly, research has shown that you get the same result from meditation as you do from the effects of LSD and MDMA used in clinical trials.  Google ""LSD in processing trauma"" or ""LSD and PTSD"" articles and some of those articles will likely mention meditation.   I have been practicing meditation for four months, but I got serious about it after reading that article. I started five days ago because my flashbacks had slowed down two months ago, and I was feeling stagnated.  I have had several memories pop up within hours of meditation, basically overnight.  So it is working creepily quickly and effectively.   I recommend that."

Is she seriously trying to equalize the two of you, so she can compare herself with you? Like ""I can handle myself, why can't you""?   Is she just wanting to separate from her husband because of this identity crisis? Call me crazy, but vows are vows. If other factors are involved, that's another matter.  She is wrong. Your PTSD symptoms are literally biological (i.e. doesn't just involve circumstances or simple neurochemistry) and of a different nature entirely from her grief and whatever else is happening with her. Medicine is medicine, but I wouldn't take Tylenol for my diabetes. And in that same vein, the Tylenol to cure my headache in a few hours' time is a different struggle than a diabetic taking meds, watching their diet, and slowly getting their sugar under control.

At the risk of sounding judgmental, in the big scheme of things, some traumas or more heinous and others. That does not mean that one person feels it less than another, but some are more personally or emotionally dramatic in general than another might be. I think that you need to decide your therapy is your therapy and janes is hers and that may not be for invalidation to you. That's okay.nsome crimes are more happiness in others. That doesn't mean the lesser painsare easier to deal with, that depends on the person and their coping skills. But that does not mean that every hurt is equal.  Recovery is not a race or contest. It helps when you see others who can identify with you. But even if they can't that does not lessen some of the experience. Nor does it make a greater. Everyone in their own circumstances asked decide how harmful a heart is to them. It could be negligible depending on the circumstances or it could be devastating, and both could feel as horrible to each person involved. You need to validate your own experiences and not compare them to anyone else. No hate. Everyone hurts and everyone feels that a different way.

ptsd,3ayms9,cdooginz,2,Thu Jun 25 02:07:34 2015 UTC,"I agree with ""don't eat my leftovers"". I'm not in the best shape, but in studying martial arts, I learned how to break a nose, break a knee,  incapacitate someone by striking their throat or nose, etc. does that make me feel confident in a fight? No. My advice to my friends and family is always to look for DNA if anything happens to me. But, in my perspective, if someone is going  to Hurrme, I am going to hurt them enough for Dna evidence. I studied martial arts for a long time. Am I good at it? No not at all. Am I good enough to draw DNA? Yes. Always  I'd like to survive,but  if I don't, my wish is people will check for DNA.

No feeling of any kind other than this awareness that I should be feeling things, but can't and am therefore much more full of fear. Fear of it never returning, or just being this non-existent waste of space that people have to deal with. Fear of losing the few good things and/or feelings that make me feel alive and give me a break from the nightmare that is this life with PTSD. Those good things keep me alive and keep me moving forward. They can't be gone."
ptsd,3awxm1,Xpeer_i_mint,5,Wed Jun 24 04:05:15 2015 UTC,"When I have felt like you do (I used to a whole lot!), before I got slapped with this label from the brain doctors, I used to take risks. Some times without caring about the outcome.  Without putting anybody else in danger ofc, I try to keep the speed limit, mostly.. I drive a two stroke so it's not very hard ;)   I used to skateboard as a late teen and young adult. I was never awesome at it but being able to do it at any time kinda saved my life for a few years. If you are too angry to focus at the minimum level, physical pain. It helped me make a habit of doing as many challenges at risk of a little hurt as I can in my daily life and if possible in my work. I took jobs as a climbing rigger but I'm silly afraid of heights.  Also I noticed a lot of other lost people are attracted to sports like that. Where doing it wrong is going to hurt, proportional to invested risk, energy, the speed and where you MUST mentally be 100% in the present or be prepared to get slapped with the hurt stick and get scars and brag rights.   Meeting people who ""know"" and are there for similar reasons are kind of easier to be around without having to explain or excuse your absent mind.  Like when you spent 20 minutes with somebody with music blasting, trashing and bailing and pretty much only ever saying oww when someone slams or tapping your board 3 times when you are impressed makes for a space where every mood and mode is OK. As long as you are OK with other people being just as consumed with shit and trying their best to do something impossibly hard without having to wear a plaster or full body cast as a result, just to feel anything at all..  I met someone a long time ago who was a professional wing suit base jumper. He had been in perpetual surgery sessions for a few years and had to reposition pretty much his entire skeleton. He was super depressed but couldn't wait for his legs to heal enough that he could go back up and fly. He had worked his ass off in rehab between surgeries and reconstruction because to him there was no other option. Spending the rest of his days clutching a fading memory of how it feels to dive down the side of a mountain just wasn't an option to him.  I can relate very much to how you feel but no drugs, legal prescription or otherwise really helped me and I have tried all but exotic extremes. They just numb the numbness a little but with varying degrees of tolerable to horrible side effects. The horrible mostly from prescribed ones as I never took any of the illegal ones in my daily life.  Last time I skateboarded, I walked for a couple of hours to the other side of town, In the middle of the night, after bars closed, carrying my board just to ride down a really long several minute long nicely paved and steep hill. in the day it would be full of traffic and a really boring (or stupid) ride. I wanted to be as fast as the board would go. Knowing if I slammed and got hurt, best outcome would be not having a lot of skin on half my body after going 60-0 km/h face first down the asphalt. This was not a longboard so just a pebble can yank the board away from under your feet.  One of the main roads in my town. It was late fall and just above freezing and the only reason I wasn't cold was because I walked there so fast my legs hurt. I left my board in my old apt building for somebody to find. Not enough people my age still skate and the town removed the 24h access shabby old dirty skate park in the center of town. Challenges where there is some risk and where I learn or experience something new help me nowadays more than anything else.   For instance Yesterday I made an arrangement to have a champion  coffee brewer teach me some of her tricks.  Learning skills from dedicated people helps me a lot. It kinda makes me feel alive when I'm all dead inside.   Some times the problem is merely noticing I am feeling that way and applying the right countermeasures. At least you have the first part figured out!   Once I sprained my ankle and couldn't walk on it by involuntarily applying more and more tension to it without being aware of what I was doing until it snapped and woke me up. I wasn't sleeping I was just dissociating as I did thousands of times before when I only wanted to sleep or be not living. All I got was a sweet pimp limp. You have my feels. I know yours very well.  TL:DR It seems to me that when body has so much adrenaline going on for no tangible and apparently attackable sources that only apathy exists. It must be balanced by doing and achieving things that normally should and would generate as much excitement, terror, joy and risk or personal discomfort to recalibrate the brain and get back on top of things.  Basically put your entire physical self in a world of well deserved hurt equal to your grief and you will be returned to the now. The current instant.   Where you are and what is in front of you instead of everything past, future, next door, outside, etc.  I don't mean cut yourself (I tried that too when I was a kid but it didn't help much. It led to the right idea eventually though!) More in the lines of spend a night outside in a storm without shelter and absorb the wisdom from the rain and thunder until you have empathy with people thru the ages, in the time before language. Before words and society. And most of all when you start enjoying the discomfort because YOU administer it.  Stretching comfort zones by good measures is the only method that really helps me against my apathy.   SuperTL:DR Hippie nonsense above. Yeah I hug trees. It is hard to climb them without. Improve your balance. I mean literal and physical. Anchor yourself in the now by touching the floor with both hands planted flat on the floor. If you can't do that then try once or twice every day until you can. Fill your spare time with tiny challenges like that will keep your mind more tuned with whatever is present and make you feel in control of yourself and your feelings. Also learn something new as often as you can. Your brain will thank you!  Best wishes from another robot.   Edit: Didn't mean to wall of text. It's just a bit hard to relay my thoughts on an issue I have spent years dealing with by myself in today's 140 character universe."

ptsd,3awxm1,LivingInFearPTSDgirl,3,Wed Jun 24 18:42:21 2015 UTC,In a way yes. But not quite. I'm not really an adrenalin junkie but they have a few good things to teach about existing in the present and being the master of own comfort zones. It is a lot less about being reckless than it is about states of alarm and being the master of them. Successfully doing something where success is 100% down to you and how well you trust what your body is telling you. If somebody says you have ptsd then I'm sure you have experienced dread and bodily fright more than the average person. When you confront it on your own terms. Your body is a really powerful and accurate instrument. Ever wondered what height above your own head you would leap from onto solid ground before it hurts too much? What gives in first? Will you get insane from boredom if you test what distance you can cover on foot before you scream for help or will the blisters defeat you? Challenge the weather and nature. Enjoy blistering cold against bare skin because you choose to and have the chance to enjoy the feeling. Brave something. Defeat yourself.  Could you jump from twice your height without being scared of the ground without hesitation?

ptsd,3awxm1,tpm_,1 point,Wed Jun 24 09:37:31 2015 UTC,"No I didn't use ritalin for the PTSD. I was quite lucky actually, because I had no idea that MDMA could be so good for PTSD, but I just took it one night to party with a friend. It put me in the headspace I needed to see that I could work through all of my problems and be a better person. I've taken it once or twice since then with a more therapeutic purpose, and it helped, but I really learned 90% of what I needed just from that one use. I can't recommend it for everyone but it is really phenomenal how much it really helps some of us.  If anyone is reading this and is interested in more, the man who (re)discovered MDMA, Alexander Shulgin, wrote a book about his drug discoveries, including MDMA. It's called PiHKAL and it's a nice biography of his and his wife's life, but it goes into the therapeutic uses he was discovering for MDMA and other psychedelics. After my experience, I found reports in that book that are very similar to my experience: someone has a life-long traumatic problem that is suddenly knocked out of place by the unique headspace of MDMA. A very, very fascinating drug, indeed."

I have same issues as you, re: external validation. I don't have a perfect answer, but what has helped me is self-care and exploring new interests. As you take care of yourself and see yourself gain new skills, you begin to take pride in that person rather than be ashamed.

ptsd,3au4y7,Chalica,3,Tue Jun 23 18:30:16 2015 UTC,"Hi there. Something that has helped me reclaim my body after trauma has been to do things which make me feel strong and capable. I like rock climbing, yoga, and weight lifting. The constant results and progress give me a boost of self-esteem, because I am completing things I set out to do and reaching goals. I suffered from a lot of eating related issues after my abuse (binging, starving, purging, etc.) and had a very low self-image. Getting stronger and feeling fitter has helped me feel better about myself, and confident in the things this body can do. It also reminds me it is MY body that I am in control of, and no one else's."
ptsd,3au4y7,xlightbrightx,3,Wed Jun 24 01:11:49 2015 UTC,"Seconding this. If I hadn't started weight lifting, I don't know how I would have stopped restricting and I'd probably be in very bad shape at this point. The idea of taking control over my body is something really resonates."
ptsd,3au4y7,Layil,2,Wed Jun 24 05:15:04 2015 UTC,"It took me a lot of time and sorting out feelings, then looking at how non-abused people treated themselves and how badly I treated myself and then trying to be kinder to myself. Making goals like ""today I'm not going to think badly of myself, today I'm gonna try to believe I'm worth something."" It's not something that ever really goes away but you slowly treat yourself better, tell people what you want, realize you deserve love and to be treated kindly and if you aren't being treated that way that it's not your fault it's the other person. Because most people don't immediately blame themselves you should give yourself the same treatment, stick up for yourself and don't be afraid to dump people or demand change or better communication.   I went through multiple situations where people blamed me and after needing therapy, medication etc... The one thing that helped was realizing I don't have to blame myself for not being pretty, smart, for being abused, for being mistreated and assaulted. I have worth, every one has worth, so why should I treat myself as subhuman? I've seen people more ugly, horrible, and stupid than me. Do I hate them or mistreat them? No, because I'm not a monster, I treat them like a human being even if I don't like them because they are rude or hurtful. As someone who realizes human beings make mistakes and it's okay, I try to remind myself of it. I'm human even if I don't feel like it sometimes.   TLDR: I compare how normal healthy people treat themselves and try to treat myself better everyday. I self reflect on how I treat myself and take it one day at a time. I rediscover hobbies and things I like because you need to find yourself again, being abused makes you adapt to bad situations so you don't get hurt as much or in trouble. Sometimes that means you deny yourself things like being selfish or hobbies, it's not bad to be selfish. Being selfish lets you be honest about how you feel in a relationship. I already typed too much, but bottom line: treat yourself."

ptsd,3au4y7,Acrophobe,2,Wed Jun 24 03:29:30 2015 UTC,"He's the problem not you. Some people aren't worth having in your life because they drag you down like a crocodile drowning its prey, you are their prey. If someone else was in your situation you would tell them to stop seeing this ""friend"" because they clearly aren't treating them well. Friends don't hurt friends or use friends. Friends give mutual support and don't steal from them. It's okay to tell people that you no longer want to be brought down, it's okay to stand up for yourself and treat yourself like you were friends with yourself. You wouldn't treat a friend like you treat yourself so be friends with yourself first even if you have to fake it at first, even if you feel ridiculous. It's hard breaking the cycle of self blame and self abuse, but it's worth it, because you are worth it."

No idea, but if you find one let the rest of us know, ey. ;)  Seriously, though: talk to your doctor. I just started on Celexa 5mg and I'm still in the beginning-adjusting-wow-this-is-weird stage, but I have a feeling it's going to really work for me. My paranoia has been cut into a fraction in just a few days. I went from being a total mess and crying every day to just, calm. My writing has suffered somewhat but I've read that this will pass once I'm through the adjustment phase. (Concentration does tend to suffer in the beginning.)  Everything you're mentioning is a product of trauma. There is nothing 'wrong' with you -- I've experienced similar things. You need to do intensive trauma-work in therapy with a good, licensed professional. It sounds like you're in survival mode. They can help you work your way out of it.   Also: look into meditation. Look into mindfulness. It helped me a ton. Unfortunately and like with all good things -- there is no quick fix. Things take time, and work. But you can get there. Also: you don't have to talk to your friends in-depth about what has happened with you (I've found that my well-adjusted friends are generally so shocked by the content of my trauma -- by the severity and awfulness of what a living person did to me -- that they shut down and have no idea how to respond) ... but maybe let them know that you're going through some hard stuff right now and you need their support. I completely cut myself off during the peak of my trauma and it was an awful mistake. Try to engage with them, even if you're all fucked up (just tell them that you're all fucked up) and do it in a way that is safe for you -- e.g. maybe tea in your home for half an hour or however long may work.   Sending love."

MDMA can cause serotonin toxicity and other negative effects when mixed with serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

One other thing I want to say is knowing how to do a thing is one part, motivation is an other and ability the third. You need all three or it wont work. For us here the ability part can be hard to understand, because sometimes it is about seemingly easy things like making a call.  As for the drugs, there is a whole pharmacy to choose from. What exactly is right for you is something you'll have to find out with trial and error together with your psychiatrist. The same drugs can affect different people differently. However there is no golden pill that makes it all well. You will have to do a lot of healing yourself. I highly recommend finding a therapy that feels right. I do believe that all the goals you mention are things you will achieve. Unfortunately many of them will take their sweet time. There is a way, but it's a marathon.

The social pain/disconnection of PTSD means that I want to turn my feelings off, it's painful to empathize with people when it's not working out.

ptsd,3aqueo,LivingInFearPTSDgirl,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:19:46 2015 UTC,"I used to be SO good at interacting with people, so good... now, I practically have Asperger's.    This made me smile; I have been diagnosed with Personality Disorder NOS and depersonalisation disorder, after having a particularly eventful childhood. However, every mental health professional I have spoken to, also wonders whether I have an autistic disorder of sorts. The lines between neurodevelopmental disorders and inner detachment definitely blur, and can have a very similar presentation.  I seem to have two modes, as it were, either I am emotionally detached, and also somewhat mentally detached; I am a selfless void. Even now, I feel it must be apparent in the way I speak. These are shallow, non-tangiable statements. I am also inclined, and have, and then removed, to repeat what I say, even within a few sentences, without being aware of it; as if even my memory is hardly interested in the dull, meaningless forms these emotionless thoughts take. I used to be very vocal, and almost lyrical in my speech. I am still am at times. Most of the time though; a vast experiential emptiness and speech that in an appropriately deadening manner reflects this emptiness.   Then there is this mode where I am engulfed by emotion. I then am so sad, that I cannot see the world outside of this terrible sadness. It encompasses all. Everything I think hurts me, everything I see, hurts me. I can never stay in that mode for long, though it can feel strangely nice at times, even if that seems contradictory to me. It becomes too much. This mostly happens when I am by, a given something, confronted with myself in a way that I cannot avoid. It happens during my therapy, but also when my dog got operated, or last week at work, when a colleague was somewhat frustrated and upset at my careless physical presentation, she then continued to compare me to her neurologist son, who would never dare to publicly appear the way I did. It was really upsetting, and played right into my own very present awareness that I am indeed so inideal, though that word does not reflect the way I feel it; not even worthless manages to express it appropriately; worthless means being of no value, if only my presence was so consoling; I am a burden, a sore to the eye, a displeasure to be around; at most I suppose, I am something the socialists can feel good about, a pitiful cause that their tax money goes too, so that they can feel good and with that assign some meaning to an otherwise meaningless thing. I do not often allow myself to have these thoughts, because at some level I can determine their invalidity (and inexcusable weakness), at the same time, at another it is as real as any reality can get and the worries and insecurities that stem from this are on my mind all day, even if emotionlessly so.  I have no answer; though I suppose by writing this, and giving some right to the sadness that lingers deep below, I was all but a tense void for a short while. I was very sad instead."

Many people would not be able to do this, but you are making sure that this woman is never able to do something like this again by making sure the authorities know about her.  I know she has cancer, but you never know... some of these asshats can still manage to abuse others even when they are terribly ill.    My parents were horribly abusive to me.  Most of the people I have ever met don't understand it and some of them simply refuse to believe that this kind of abuse even happens.  I know a little of what you're going through and I have some thoughts on how to handle people who don't understand your story when you tell them.  If you don't want unsolicited advice, stop reading here.  I can completely understand not feeling able to deal with advice sometimes and that's okay.  Just know that I am rooting you on.  If you don't mind a few tips, here they are...  Focus on the people who do get it.  Most people may not get it, but some people will.  Focus on the people who understand.    Some people will never stop poking you about this.  They will want more details.  They will want you to keep making your case to them and they still will never understand or believe you.  I really recommend refusing to tell this type of person anything more about this.  Draw a line.  Tell them ""we aren't talking about this anymore.""  When they bring it up again, refuse to talk about it.  If they really cannot let it go, avoid them as much as you can or need to to avoid this nonsense.    Look for support groups for people who have been molested/raped as children.  Those people will get it and it will add to the number of people in your life who understand.  There are probably bunch of them online.  There may also be some in your hometown.  The folks over at /r/rape may be able to recommend some online forums to you."

ptsd,3aro23,powlesy6,3,Mon Jun 22 23:27:04 2015 UTC,"Hey there, thanks for opening up on here. Sounds like a lot of heartache, and I'm sorry you've gone through all of this. As far as PTSD diagnostic criteria goes, nothing in the circumstances you mentioned here meet the initial criterion for PTSD (the external traumatic cause). I've copied and pasted from the VA website (not specific to combat trauma, but the VA usually has the most updated info in general):   The person was exposed to: death, threatened death, actual or threatened serious injury, or actual or threatened sexual violence, as follows: (one required)  Direct exposure.  Witnessing, in person.  Indirectly, by learning that a close relative or close friend was exposed to trauma. If the event involved actual or threatened death, it must have been violent or accidental.  Repeated or extreme indirect exposure to aversive details of the event(s), usually in the course of professional duties (e.g., first responders, collecting body parts; professionals repeatedly exposed to details of child abuse). This does not include indirect non-professional exposure through electronic media, television, movies, or pictures.   It's possible for a person to experience one of these things, and have it lie dormant for years until a huge stressor (like your original post) sort of 'triggers' it. It's good to see a counselor/therapist anyway, but if you think that might be you, they'd be the ones who can assess that, and only a doctor can diagnose you. When one of the above traumas happen to a person, it's sort of like the concept of fuses in your circuit breaker—they're designed to protect the unit it's part of, and in a similar way the brain's response to an extreme trauma is biological and survival based. Here's a couple of quotes from a paper—sort of long but an interesting and informative read:   If the trauma is prolonged, extreme or repetitive, it can actually physically injure the brain. The best analogy is that the amygdala stays in the alert state so long that it gets “stuck” there. It keeps the body from operating a healthy combination of the hot and cool systems. The neuron pathways in the amygdala lose their “elasticity” or ability to recover. “Hey! I am still in danger here; I need to keep the body ready to fight! OK, hippocampus, just stay cool and wait over there until I get back to you. Yo, hormones, keep ‘em coming. Nobody’s messing with MY survival. Liver, give me more sugar for energy, adrenals stay with me now.” Whoa. You can see what happens. The body depletes its resources.   ...    He or she lives and responds to “now” even though “now” may be a memory fragment from long ago. He or she cannot separate “now and safe” from “now and danger.”   Excerpt from page 14 of http://www.washacadsci.org/Journal/Journalarticles/V.93-3-Post%20Traumatic%20Stress%20Disorder.%20Sethanne%20Howard%20and%20Mark%20Crandalll.pdf  A little more info from a different source to that end.  I hope I could be of some help in your effort to find some answers...PTSD or whatever the cause, I hope things get better for you.  Edit - C-PTSD is also a thing, though not recognized on its own as a DSM-V diagnosis. Therapists will still use the concept as it exists and as it's currently understood to provide help.

Every little reminder (and believe me there was plenty, even through songs that me and my friend who I no longer speak to would set me off). It started off I'd push it aside and talk to her about it, but after I kept promising I'd let it go  more and more things would set me off and as i didn't want to mention it to her it came out in anger.

From what you've named with neglect and losing the one person who made you a priority, I would definitely name that as a trigger.  Not naming your truth, but to me it would evoke feelings of: loss, abandonment, and helplessness.  Death is a completely loaded experience, even more so for those with ptsd and are survivors of the trauma you have named. No one is going to replace the loss of a loved one like that.  I know this has me teary eyed, how have you been able to process it?  One of the things moving forward to help you, would be to create a network of support. A network of support makes it easier on the self in that there's not one pillar/person you rely on but numerous. Do you have friends you can rely on? Trust is a main issue here for anyone that's suffered what we went through.  There's a book through Amazon that has helped me greatly, you can get it at the library or spend $5 to add it to your book collection. You can find it in the hyperlink.  Boundaries and Relationships: Knowing, Protecting and Enjoying the Self https://www.amazon.com/dp/155874259X/ref=cm_sw_r_awd_IJbIvb213BMSH  As far as the job opportunity it resonates in something that happened to me Friday, had an interview that would've been life altering as well. Just received the email with feedback stating that my nerves got the best of me leaving the cfo unimpressed so they'll be going another way.

What heals you is integrating what you learned while tripping with your real life.   Have a tripsitter (I prefer two of my closest people who are keyed into what I'm doing) and maybe some valium on hand.  Also, respect the chemical. RESPECT THE CHEMICAL. Did I say it clearly enough? It's like getting in a car. You can go the speed limit (proper dose), follow traffic signs (proper precautions), and know the directions (have a goal in mind) and get to where you want to be safely.

And I'm always looking for ways to ""expand my horizons"", unfortunately with my PTSD I have to be careful with tripping my hypothalamus into adrenaline overdrive. I'm a little worried about it sending my blood pressure through the roof.  I haven't done Extacy or MDMA in over a decade because I'm afraid of the speed it's cut with. Same with LSD, but I'm game and curious. Because when I did trip, it really was enlightening and insightful.  I'm also curious about psilocybins. I'm a horticulturist who grows culinary mushrooms like oysters and shiitakes in my kitchen. The one and only time I did magic mushrooms that I grew, was the night Princess Diana died. I was alone, tripping hard, watching tv, and it was BAD. When the news alert interrupted regularly scheduled programming, somehow in my altered, drug addled state, I was convinced it was all my fault - if I hadn't had done mushrooms, she wouldn't have died. Omg, Lol!! I personally somehow killed The People's Princess from a million miles away.  I haven't done them since. But it's been long enough that I'm willing to give it another go.

It is an emotional journey. It is rough, it is tiresome. I started treating EMDR like confronting a Dementor from Harry Potter. It drains you, but after each time you win. The Year and a half of EMDR has made me a much stronger minded person and I can handle a lot more than I could previously. I had the same dream once a week for four years, and through EMDR i realized that was a FLashback and I confronted it and have never had it again.   Even though I know I have had some triggers with moving, The PTSD (as mentioned by SO) are so much more tangible. I can control way more in my life. And more importantly anything that i have been triggered by are new things. I don't have the same Flashback. It is a moment that was hidden even deeper that is now able to emerge because of such a specific event. I praise EMDR for giving me emotional control.  I did do a few things before starting EMDR. I worked through a Dialectical Behavior Therapy hand book. That really helped me confront stuff during EMDR"

Regarding your girlfriend, my boyfriend grew up in a very loving, close knit, ""normal"" family. It has taken him years to understand how I feel about my family, as well as reading books Ive recommended and really allowing him to see how they continue to be shitty parents. It's really, really hard for someone who hasn't lived it or hasn't had friends who lived it to understand. I guess this is a posting to everyone who wonders why significant others aren't always supportive or understanding, which feels like betrayal to me.

OP may well have a positive ""father figure"" nowadays who they can spend time with and celebrate and thank, but it doesn't change the fact that to everyone else the day is dedicated to the father, and because of that you are being bombarded with all of the things that remind you about who that person was to you.  This isn't something that can be willed away. You can't make the day what it isn't. Your friends will be celebrating their fathers. Advertisements everywhere will tell you to celebrate yours and so on. And then you'll be dealing with the questions that immediately follow, ""What did you do on father's day?""  The only thing that'll help that is a lot of time, a lot of work, and a lot of healing and it won't be centered around father's day, but instead OP and their trauma in general.

Besides it not being most people's business, it also does not need an explanation.  Tons of people do not drink, for so many various reasons.

I am still actively healing with somatic experiencing, yoga and meditation.  I am light years beyond where I ever thought I could be in terms of quality of life- and there are still large chunks of memory (I'm talking years) which have never returned.

But I find that as I've given up trying to find them, they show up in their own time anyway. Usually after I've done some healing around the time period in which they occurred. And they aren't so bad. I can usually figure out why my brain thought they were so awful. But they just don't seem like anything more than part of who I am. I'm not sure if that makes sense at all, and everybody experiences different things. I just know that when I stopped trying to find all the bad things hidden in my brain, life got easier."
ptsd,3ajhzk,algohn,1 point,Sun Jun 21 01:08:01 2015 UTC,"It hasn't worked that way for me.    Are you working with a therapist?

In my case the more I've healed, the more came back but still just bits and pieces.  I recommend finding a good therapist specializing in trauma; going it alone can be difficult and its easy to retraumatize yourself and make it worse."
ptsd,3ajhzk,algohn,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:50:56 2015 UTC,"My therapist told me it was questionable if EMDR would help me (I've heard this from multiple therapists and done other research on it too,) and it seems that EMDR works best for people who have only one or a few traumatic experiences, and who have full strings of memories for the traumatic event(s).  EMDR walks people through the traumatic memory to integrate the trauma more fully, so it is questionable if it would help for someone with as little memory as me.  I'm not sure though, I don't know."
ptsd,3ajhzk,AtlanticArt,1 point,Sun Jun 21 11:18:58 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you and I may have similar histories- for me the trauma was intense, unremitting and lasted for decades.   What works for someone with trauma from a single event, or acquired in adulthood may not work for those of us who grew up with it.  Myself I don't worry anymore about what I can remember- my body and nervous system remember the fear and other symptoms perfectly, so in therapy I work with those to learn to get grounded and safe when triggered.  It hasn't stopped my progress at all.  I d pretty much just come to the conclusion that my brain is protecting me and just to be grateful and trust that.  This is just my experience, of course.

Or the time he went over to his second wife's house (they were separated at the time, and again he was drunk). She wouldn't talk to him so he put his hand through a window trying to unlock the door.  I get up in the morning to discover him in his bed, with his sheets covered in blood. He did try to wrap his arm before he went to bed, and ended up getting stitches in the morning. He has a 6-inch scar on his arm now. I am sure there are others that I just don't remember. Also, not sure if these events were alcohol related, PTSD related, or a bit of both."
ptsd,3aj2ty,AtlanticArt,3,Sat Jun 20 18:50:04 2015 UTC,"well PTSD can cause alcoholism so in it's core it's PTSD related.  Also, you don't have to be diagnosed with ptsd to have it.   If i were you i would see your doctor, just to be sure. Maybe he can send you to a phsychologist and you can talk about it in a trusted environment.

ptsd,3aj2ty,lynxnloki,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:39:01 2015 UTC,"I am reading a lot of ""he"" statements, but what about you?   Usually, people need to seek out help to be diagnosed when they are having symptoms interfere with their life. Are you having problems like this? Nightmares that haunt you all day? Intrusive memories? Uncontrollable emotions (Persistent negative trauma-related emotions (e.g., fear, horror, anger, guilt, or shame). Flashbacks? Persistent thoughts that you are the worst thing in the world and that the world is unsafe? Irritable or aggressive, self-destructive or reckless behavior? Hyper Vigilance? Problems sleeping? Dissociation? Derealization?   I don't want to scare you with all those things, but if you have that stuff, you should seek out a professional. If not, it's still a good idea to get checked out, but you probably don't have secondary PTSD. I can see how your dad would be (maybe overly?) concerned though - people with PTSD tend to highly exaggerate blame and put it on themselves. I know I have to be careful to not ""diagnose"" my younger siblings in my own head, just because they went through some of what I went through. Everyone's different, and statistics show that most people who experience a traumatic event do not develop PTSD. They suffer, of course, but they come out of it without serious, life-altering problems. Your dad probably feels extreme guilt about it. Whether you have this or not, try working on things with your dad. Try understanding his PTSD, it may help you understand yourself as well in ways you couldn't have before.   One more thing - I reread your comments and I'd like to recommend looking into info on ""adult children of alcoholics"".

It happens in one of two events, or sometimes, those events parallel to each other:  One, you're healthier, you're healing, you're coming to terms, so your brain is starting to slide out of basic ""survival"" mode and into ""oh hey I'm a person"" mode so everything is firing differently... so memories and events that you never thought about because your brain put it in the ""fuck no, we can't, we gotta live to see another day, don't do it, don't look it"" start slipping through the cracks because your brain is less of a complex system of locks and hidden cells and more of a... well, regular brain, that lets you think on things and feel feelings other than ""fear"" and ""shame"".  Two, you've been in a sort of traumatized person stasis for a while, perhaps not better or in better circumstances, but adjusted, at what is considered normal for your weirdo trauma life, and some fresh hell appears and your brain has to go, ""oh, fuck me, is this a new thing? what is the thing???"" and in the panic it drops some of the poop piles it's held cluttered in it's sad little trauma arms while it's trying to shove away the new crazy... and this is especially prevalent among those of us who have PTSD from childhood trauma.

Then I upped and quit one night and withdrawal was really really bad, and then I checked out mentally for seven weeks, and when I came back to myself, all hell broke lose.    I realized I should have been scared seven weeks before when I got really ill, but I was too checked out and chemically imbalanced to notice.  So when I came to with my mind again, I started processing the fear of the withdrawal I should have experienced back seven weeks prior, and I think my brain was like, ""Oh, well if I'm processing the fear of seven weeks ago now, may as well pull out all this other crap hiding back here from years and decades ago and deal with that now too - that would be efficient, kill two birds with one stone.""  I think that happened."
ptsd,3ahu4f,CareflulWithThatAxe,2,Sat Jun 20 13:11:37 2015 UTC,"Wow. same thing happened to me, and I've been wondering why the hell it happened when it did and not years earlier. Well, I was addicted to opioids for many years - about a year into recovery, I just started getting hit left and right with flashbacks, panic attacks that sent me to the hospital, dissociation that left me running through town and hiding behind buildings for nomdamn reason and on and on.   I've always suspected that getting clean had to do with it. I wish I could find some studies on that, since so many people with (C) PTSD develop a substance abuse.  Edit: I have a friend that always says that he thinks that my addiction was traumatizing in itself. Living that life in general is crap. Getting clean was a bit traumatizing, especially since it started with an arrest and kicking heroin in jail with seizures for a while. I don't know what your story is, but I know I still have nightmares about getting dopesick.   I'm really gonna think on this today. Thank you again."
ptsd,3ahu4f,CareflulWithThatAxe,2,Tue Jun 23 14:06:04 2015 UTC,"Yep.  Well, most addicts (up to 80%) have suffered trauma in childhood and/or adolescence.  Substance abuse is a (poor) coping mechanism for emotional self-regulation.  Nearly all people who are traumatize have difficulty regulating their emotional states: i.e. they get angry very easily, go up and down a lot, and can't maintain a positive or calm state of mind.  This is a normal effect of trauma.  As a result, people search for ways to emotionally regulate themselves and control their moods. Addiction is one of those ways.  CPTSD and PTSD and any kind of trauma processing cannot happen while a person is abusing substances. Even if they are ""only"" sometimes abusing them, the substance abuse screws up the brain's processing of trauma - it actually halts the process entirely.  So, upon sobering up, the brain finds it has an opportunity to do it finally.  Also, I bet using can be traumatic in certain circumstances, because your brain cannot process emotions in the moment of something happening. So, if something really bad happens while a person is under the influence of something, they could have some emotions to deal with later in regards to that thing from the past. Now, I am not by any means saying that using causes PTSD, but it can cause PTS from particularly bad events that happened while the brain was under the influence and therefore not able to process the stress at the time. I bet when you went cold turkey off heroin like that, you had a similar experience to mine - the straw that broke the camel's back, so to speak.  Depending how delicate the balance was already in the brain (because a lot of substance abusers move into addiction right around the time that PTSD symptoms get worse, to medicate those symptoms) it takes sometimes not huge events (though I do think seizures from withdrawals sounds pretty huge) to break that balance.   I'm ten months in.  Yay us! Did the flashbacks just start just now for you?"
ptsd,3ahu4f,tigalicious,3,Tue Jun 23 21:25:22 2015 UTC,"Their logic makes no sense!  I'm not ""ready"" now for my flashbacks, yet if I get triggered by the ""right"" thing they happen regardless!"
ptsd,3ahu4f,Jan291,2,Sat Jun 20 09:01:47 2015 UTC,Exactly. WTF?
ptsd,3ahu4f,Rahasiakita,3,Sat Jun 20 09:51:23 2015 UTC,Maybe ready is the wrong word. Who is ever ready for this? Maybe the flashbacks started when your brain decided that you now were strong enough to survive them. I did not remember anything of my abuse for 8 years and I think I got flashbacks when I got them because I'd become strong enough to survive the knowledge they carried. Does this make any more sense to you?
ptsd,3ahu4f,dhays2000,2,Sat Jun 20 10:37:40 2015 UTC,"But then why could I survive them now and not before? It sounds like ""strong enough to survive"" = ""ready"" so that brings me to the same question of what makes people/my brain think I'm ""strong enough to survive"" now, but not earlier?"
ptsd,3ahu4f,LivingInFearPTSDgirl,4,Sat Jun 20 10:40:25 2015 UTC,"I've had the feeling that if anything more happened, anything at all, I would just shatter, maybe kill myself, maybe go psychotic. So I feel confident saying it took everything I had to survive the thick of it. I also believe that with 16, when the first flashback occurred, I was stronger and more mature than at younger ages. However, it also takes a trigger to get it started, so maybe what triggered me then was the first trigger strong enough since I'd become strong enough.  This is where my reasoning comes from. It happened to me as a kid, so this theory is easy to swallow for me. I don't know how or if it applies to you."
ptsd,3ai30v,NyxBean,3,Sat Jun 20 11:33:05 2015 UTC,"I have complex PTSD and wasn't in ""safe"" situations until a few years ago. My problems are heavily related to abandonment/neglect so maybe I can help a little.  First and foremost, if you were with someone & you weren't close enough with them to tell them about your diagnosis, or if you just couldn't trust them with that info or if they never wanted to talk about it... I don't know, it sounds like either they aren't worth while, you aren't ready to be with anyone, or a little bit of both.  I don't think anyone with PTSD or C-PTSD should try to be with someone before they've tackled mostly the shame portion of trauma. That shame will cling to everything and it will poison it. It will make you a mark for shitty relationship because that shame gives you teeny tiny indicators to predators and manipulative people that you're a safe bet. And if you find someone outside of that, it'll just cling.   Even if after that you are with someone and they leave... it's probably going to trigger all of your abandonment and intimacy issues, how could it not? Especially if you didn't have the opportunity to have healthy relationships/attachments in your formative years, or perhaps just in a while since X trauma. You had a thing, it was yours, now thing is gone. It sucks. Even for the healthiest of person it's a kind of trauma.   By that I mean, you HAVE to mourn, grieve, bury the plans and hopes you had with that person, feel it, and pick yourself up again. Those of us who are conditioned to not feel it, shove it down, or for it to lead to bigger and badder things... we're not so great at that.   That last thing you're describing sounds like it could be potentially be regression, a flashback, or just a heavy dissociative episode. Or even in the healthiest of person... to an extent, heartbreak makes us all assholes.  Please remember that you don't owe anyone anything. Ever. If you want, send that person a letter explaining things, but only if you're ready to, and only if you can say ""x, y, z triggered me because of a, b, c"" but still take responsibility for it. It's tricky, but if you can't do both yet, it's okay, but just let it go. And when I say send a letter I mean it. Don't text or call. That opens a door way for you to keep trying that OVER AND OVER. Don't send a facebook message. You'll see if they ignored you. Or you'll get into the slippery slope of social media + heartache and that shit is hell on abandonment issues.  In my experience, my abandonment and intimacy issues manifest as control issues when someone is leaving me. And that manifests in a lot of ways... my e.d. gets weird, I self harm to stop myself from dissociating, I find an easily manipulated other relationship/friendship and am half way in a boundaries olympics before I realizing what I'm doing there...  and I've learned that I've gotta channel that in healthy ways. Get over organized with my calendar. Do a redo of my house cleaning-wise. Organize my safe foods. Make myself measure intake/outtake so I still function like a person amidst e.d.  This was very long, I'm sorry... I hope it kinda helped or made you feel less alone? Lemme know if I can follow up with anything."
ptsd,3ai30v,auburnstark,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:12:04 2015 UTC,"Thank you. This has helped. I feel less like I'm crazy or forever broken and more like a person who has had some bad times. I definitely have to try harder, find as much support as possible, and do more to make sure it doesn't spill out on to other people. However, this makes me feel less like smashing myself over the head with my issues.  I'm pretty much the same in that I haven't been in mostly safe areas until a few years ago and actually the ex before this most recent one was incredibly manipulative and extremely toxic for me.  I'll give a little clarity on my current situation. I'm not sure why or if it will lead to anything but as you've already made me feel better I don't see why not.   if you were with someone & you weren't close enough with them to tell them about your diagnosis, or if you just couldn't trust them with that info or if they never wanted to talk about it   It wasn't so much that, I don't think. I was open about my diagnoses. Now I am beginning to wonder if he even looked into them, understood them, or assumed he got what they were because he knew other people who were diagnosed but hadn't read any writing on the matter.   During this break-up process (the ""maybe friends"" phrase was dropped and my flatmate needs to go pick up my keys so I don't know where the end is), I am still wondering if he's paying it any mind. When it was happening he sounded like angry parent--a trigger--and said ""I've had enough of this behaviour,"" and it made me upset because at the time I felt I couldn't stop it. Eventually I folded in on myself.   I don't think anyone with PTSD or C-PTSD should try to be with someone before they've tackled mostly the shame portion of trauma.   Personally I think I have done this but of course, I can't say for sure. The separation brought out a lot of it but during the relationships it was more to do with both of our difficulties with communication (I might be autistic, going through diagnosis, and there's something up with him which he hasn't bothered looking into). For him, he would make statements which would sound like manipulative and cruel people in my past but he was trying to say something else. I was starting to work around this and work out what he actually meant and thought progress was being made. Then he turned round and said he couldn't handle me.  Something about him not being well enough in himself which more came out like ""It's not you; it's me,"". At first he said maybe we could try again after therapy. I was panicky and might have said no, I can't be sure, but afterwards he told somebody it was never. He also said he wanted to be friends but now it's ""some day"". People around me say that they believe he means the friendship aspect; I kind of want to know whether to count the meantime in months or years. ""Some day"" is vague and I think a little unfair to say to somebody who you know has severe abandonment issues and has not much of a concept of phrases concerning time.  Of course he will be going through hard emotions, I understand that. It's simply that he isn't making the moves I would if I were in his place and so I'm confused. I have quite a hard time understanding other people at the best of times and now that he seems to have completely changed, I don't know what to make of it.   By that I mean, you HAVE to mourn, grieve, bury the plans and hopes you had with that person, feel it, and pick yourself up again.   I've found that starting a blog and going over the issue for the benefit of other people while exploring it myself has been of use. Just throwing this in here in case anybody is reading a long looking for ideas of doing so.   That last thing you're describing sounds like it could be potentially be regression, a flashback, or just a heavy dissociative episode. Or even in the healthiest of person... to an extent, heartbreak makes us all assholes.   They all make sense and for me I think it's a mix of at least three of those ideas. It was pretty brutal. Reality skewed to the side in even a physical sense, if that is the right way to describe it? Things didn't look slanted and I didn't fall over but it felt like I was in a dream at points. Regression and flashback are incredibly likely. I was reminded a lot of other times during it and I think I was repeating ""Not again"" over and over when I was rocking back and forth. Honestly, it felt like I was going psychotic or something.   Also, I definitely think there was a bit of break-up bastard behaviour in there.   Please remember that you don't owe anyone anything.    I want to explain so that I am understood, not necessarily so that his mind can be at ease. That would be a plus but really, it's for me. That might mean I'm selfish.   Don't send a facebook message.   I don't have a phone so I'm safe there. When I got home I told my flatmate to tell him to block me. I tried to tell them to block me on Reddit but I don't know if he did. I msg'd him here and he answered that he ""still cared and hopes [we] can be friends some day even though it will be hard or unlikely"".  I wrote a Google Doc which was angry at first but I had time to go through it, editing, clarifying, and balancing. I had this time because apparently his net was down. I think he's looked at it now though at the beginning I say he can ignore it entirely if that's what he needs to do, that I'm not demanding. Nothing has been said. My flatmate will be over there to get my keys and return games so I don't know if they'll talk much.   In my experience, my abandonment and intimacy issues manifest as control issues when someone is leaving me.    I can't do any of my own self-control mechanisms because I live with an unofficial carer. When I stopped eating or taking my pills, there was talk of having me committed. Now we're looking at social work and such.  So I wound up trying to analyse the situation, work out where I went wrong and how I could have been better, and the same for him, though he can't see that note. Shamefully I tried to find out a few things through others but I don't think I overdid it.   For me, social conventions are confusing and I don't like the extremes of don't talk at all or talk right away. If I was given a min and max number of days/months until I would hear from him, I could settle down and probably mentally add a month or two to the max number to be sure. I'm not getting that. Everything is vague and blurry. Everything was contradictory during the break-up event anyway and I don't know what is true or not. I don't know what certain people are saying about me or if he's truthful. It's stressful.  I don't know. I possibly don't make much sense. I usually don't."
ptsd,3ai30v,auburnstark,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:58:20 2015 UTC,"I've felt all of this, in some form or other. All I can add is that when I had a break up from a relationship that go... co dependently neurotic (and it sounds like maybe you guys had that a little bit) I made myself keep a dry erase board that I just used to tally how many days I'd gone without trying to talk to him. Basically I'd promise myself to go this many before texting/whatever... then okay, I went four, now try to go seven, etc... and eventually I found that I felt powerful and felt good that I could help myself and be okay without him. I also kept a notebook that was just letters that I would write to him. I'd reread them after a few weeks, told myself I'd send them if it still felt necessarily then, and it almost never did, it just healed me."
ptsd,3ai30v,madnessfalls,2,Mon Jun 22 21:51:21 2015 UTC,"Try DBT for a year.   only thing that has helped me. And yes it helps PTSD without Borderline as well as adhd and other personality disorders.  Doesn't matter so much as diagnosis as what helps (if you have a diagnosis that fits closely)  How have you acted during a bad break-up scenario when you were being dumped? Inconsolable, clingy,  furious,  hysterical. Vomiting  Each time felt like I was dying.  If you acted badly, in what way did you act and how much do you put down to the PTSD/C-PTSD, if at all? Said awful cruel things to hurt person who was hurting me as a reaction in kitchen sink style.  Yelled, screamed, cried, called in sick to work for days, dropped classes, etc.. tried seducing to get back,  winning back... -Most.  Losing something important is devestating but having worst fears of abandonment come true is horrible, paralyzing fear and misery, and inability to control impulses or regulate emotions in distress is directly related to developing with c-ptsd in a constantly abusive environment.   Still not excuse able and wanted to change.  When all is calmed down and you hope to be friends with the person, is there any point at all of showing them resources to help them understand why you acted in that manner? Don't know, they all happened before I knew what was going on with me.  They didn't used to know ongoing childhood abuse caused it... or at least Noone diagnosed me or brought it up until the last 3 years....  If you have explained to somebody in this way, did they understand, disregard, or misinterpret your attempt as an excuse rather than an explanation? Not this situation exactly, but awful behavior.   Understood kinda (due to their similar childhood), but still saw it as an excuse that I was weak.  They know I am actively working on it so cut me a little slack though only kinda got it  In what ways would you say those with PTSD/C-PTSD struggle with the aftermath of being split up with if they suffer problems with abandonment and what are some decent sources?  Feel empty, abandonded, worthless, depressed for a long time.  HOWEVER DBT vsn help greatly with disteess tolerence. Key is to get help and serious DBT plus therapy for at least a year before your next relationship, as... Fear of abandonment becomes self fulfilling as you may act controlling or be distant to try to protect yourself or be clingy or be cruel st times you feel threatened of losing the person without being aware.  Would a person with C-PTSD from childhood, certain sexual issues, and abusive/shut-off partners exhibit panic and irrational anger with things said to hurt the other, refusal to leave, then crying and an inability to leave (not managing to standing up or moving limbs, curling in on oneself)? Absolutlely Yes 100 percent if you have not had good therapy like DBT for a chunk, and even then a challenge.  Panic, fear, and distress feeling of world collapsing.  Fear of abandonment becomes self fulfilling as above.  It becomes about you feeling failure and worthless.  Saying anything to hurt the person is a defense mechanism to get whomever was abusing uou in the past away, but it does damage and is over reactive due to PtSD.  Honestly, taking a good LONG  break from the person with a sudden break until you are over it is the best way to handle breakups,  let them know you want to be friends but need a break to heal. Dragging things out or attempting friendship too soon makes it worse for longer.   Can't recommend DBT enough.  Only thing that helped after 20 years of failed therapy"
ptsd,3ai30v,meticulousmayhem,1 point,Sat Jun 27 10:04:42 2015 UTC,I was dating this guy R and had a trigger when my niece was kidnapped. I projected hard on him and became a nervous wreck when he was around. We hadn't gotten too serious so I wound up telling him I couldn't see him romantically anymore. We had mutual friends so I did see him around. I would try to joke with him but I apparently was being too mean so he cut ties. I didn't have enough self awareness at the time to see how aggressive I was being.   Edit: I have C-PTSD from childhood molestation/abuse. I attribute all of the anxiety and aggression to it. I'm normally very calm and considerate. I know my story isn't quite what you're looking for since it's not a serious tie but I imagine I would have been much worse had it been. I basically closed the door on him emotionally and inadvertently pushed him away. I tried to explain to him how PTSD was affecting me but it didn't really seem to matter in the end.

ptsd,3afo5j,pole7979,3,Fri Jun 19 19:53:36 2015 UTC,"I have not used any psychedelics in over a year, but I used to do solo lsd ""therapy sessions"" of sorts every couple months where I would have one hit of lsd and spend the trip drawing, listening to music, or sitting quietly. I did this for about 2 years. I cannot and will not recommend anyone partake in such adventures alone though. I was a bit reckless tbh. The lsd definitely helped me zoom out, so to speak, and deal with my traumas though. The best experience was from mushrooms. During that ""therapy"" session I danced around in my room and did yoga for a few hours then drew and meditated some. That helped me learn how to love my body so much more and it is one of the best experiences I have ever had. I cherish those lessons and they stick with me today.  Again, I do not suggest anyone should or should not use psychedelics. They are powerful healers that must be respected and used with great care, but I absolutely see great potential and would like to see more research done on this in the future."
ptsd,3afo5j,radicalpoptart,3,Sat Jun 20 01:18:15 2015 UTC,"I've used MDMA a few times Winter 2012-2013. It was a powerful and intense experience. It broke a lot of CPTSD chains off of me and showed me things about the world that I don't think I would have ever seen otherwise. I honestly don't think that even talking to a therapist every day for ten years could have done this. It allowed me to actually see out of the trauma I had been in all my life for a few moments and see myself without the trauma and the effects of trauma. It's difficult when the only way you have ever known yourself is as a traumatized person, you literally adopt that as your identity and personal shame. MDMA is known to smooth things out and wrap everything in a positive glow and I took it because statistically most people who take it do not regret doing so. My MDMA experience was pretty rough though. I started talking about my trauma to a lot of people (somewhat indiscriminately) while on MDMA and tried to connect. I got a lot of bad reactions which really re-traumatized me. Also now my child sexual abuse is known to people professionally who I may want to work with in the future (which may not necessarily be that bad a deal), but it has outted me as a boat rocker and someone who intends to speak up about these issues, which makes people who would like to cover them up uncomfortable.  Also people did not understand why I was not recovering from the trauma and I think judged my increase in symptoms. Quite a few family members got mad at me about talking about the abuse and told me I had gone crazy after I texted them about it while on MDMA. That was a very traumatic experience.   Maybe LSD would have been better but it seems like with LSD or psilocybin it is a lot easier to have a bad trip (this is supposedly not so much a danger with MDMA, MDMA truly smooths everything out, you only see everything in the best possible light) and I feel like it might be rougher to address trauma on LSD, it doesn't have the same soothing ""everything is alright, you're perfect"" glow about it that smooths over whatever painful memories and truths may come up the way MDMA does. Then again perhaps on LSD you wouldn't do what I did and try to connect with people who get upset at you for talking about child abuse."

Any emergency room or new doctor is likely going to either not be allowed by policy to give you anything helpful our won't want to.  There are a couple of things you can do to increase the odds though.   You said you have a new doctor in the practice. Can you see one of the other doctors in the same group? If so, ask them to look at your records and calmly explain your current situation. Ask for a referral to a psychologist who specializes in PTSD because you can't live like this. They will likely offer you meds to hold you over in the meantime.  If you are already seeing a counselor, ask them for a letter to your regular GP to explain why you need a temporary crutch.  In any case, talk about being afraid to take anything potentially addictive, seem genuinely concerned about that, and you will seem less drug seeking. Sadly, people with legitimate needs are forced to use the same tactics as drug seekers to get the basic help they need.  Just remember though, that things potentially addictive for anxiety can cause rebound anxiety which is a million times worse.  Another thing you could do is go in, talk about your problems and ask for Hydroxyzine. It's similar to Benadryl and may help you, and you'll likely get it. If it doesn't help, they may then be willing to give you something else like a benzodiazepine."

It doesn't really help with anxiety though. I was first given the halcion by a dentist (instead of valium, which I requested) and took one for sleep and it was awesome.

I would also like to put forth that most veterans with PTSD symptoms fight the idea that they could or should have it based on the fact that there are so many others who have been through worse. The fact is that for the most part, their PTSD symptoms go unrecognized or untreated, not that they don't suffer. Not being able to imagine yourself in a job outside the military is actually a sign of PTSD!   You can appeal to his ego by letting him know that treating these symptoms rather than ignoring them is actually much harder than not (cognitive processing therapy for example, requires facing your worst memories straight on) or let him know that veterans with these symptoms generally end up in one of 3 outcomes: dead, in prison, or dealt with their shit. Be aware that some symptoms are going to become worse before they get better if/when he chooses treatment. Also be aware that the drugs are not a cure, they can help with a lot of the worst symptoms from your perspective, and they are nice at times I won't lie, but many of them can also prevent recovery via therapy according to my VA psychiatrist."

There is no sharing of your most traumatic memories in a group setting in the four my husband and I have been in so far (me: cognitive processing therapy and moral injury, him: anger management and introduction to trauma recovery). Sticking with individual therapy can be tempting, but there is a looong wait at most VAs and as much as both of us were unsure about it, the peer support in the group setting is invaluable.

I think you may want to call a professional for him, if possible, under the pretense of him grabbing your throat in your sleep.

ptsd,3aftc9,Pixiepup,2,Sat Jun 20 05:11:32 2015 UTC,"I just wanted to add, it can be really helpful to talk to him quietly and soothingly when you know he's having a nightmare. You're home now, you're safe with me, etc. as well as anytime you get out if bed while he's sleeping say ""(Husband's name) it's just (your name), I'm getting back in bed now."" You should try to say this louder than if you're noticing him thrashing next to you, about normal conversational tone. My husband and I are both veterans, and this actually prevented a lot of the nighttime violence that can occur before he regains consciousness.   Also, congratulations on your own personal courage, going through this with someone you love is both difficult and frightening! My best friend's fiancé left for good as soon as he became aware of what was happening after he began strangling her in his sleep after she came back from a trip to the bathroom.

When he grabbed my throat I shouted his name and he let go but didn't wake up. Poor thing was so scared to fall asleep last night in fear of hurting me.

Keep it up! :)  What went well was that I discovered a key to success in beating PTSD, which is to stop thinking and take action.  Any time an intrusive or triggering thought popped into my head I batted it away and forced myself to stay in motion on my task list and to think about only the tasks at hand.    And I've tried to pack as many tasks and errands into my days as possible, and this sense of urgency of trying to get so many things done, has left me no room to think about anything traumatic.   So for example in the morning I found myself beginning the usual cycle of thinking and worrying and feeling disempowered. But I said to myself, ""No, don't even think, just act. Get out the door as quickly as you can."" So I took a shower at top speed, got dressed, and left the house.  Once I was outside and on my way to my first errand of the day it was like I was freed.  It helped that I had so many things that I wanted or needed to do, because it kept me caught up in ""Don't think, just keep going, and hurry!"" rather than stopping and using my own imagination or memory to traumatize myself.  :)"

ptsd,3aezvo,TripMonster,3,Fri Jun 19 16:16:59 2015 UTC,"If everything you've reported here is accurate, you're not being a ""pussy"".  Forced strangulation is highly traumatic.  I can't say whether your doctors are right (that would be medical advice, and I'm not qualified), but one of the diagnostic criteria for PTSD is experiencing the threat of death, or witnessing the same.  I hope you get the care you need.  Don't let your family pressure you into staying sick.  I don't think they need to feel responsible or guilty for you to get the treatment you need.  If you have strong suicidal thoughts and you don't have the support from your husband/family that you need to stay alive, you can always call a suicide hotline or failing that 911 (aka local emergency services if you're not American)."
ptsd,3aezvo,Cthulusuppe,3,Fri Jun 19 17:09:54 2015 UTC,"So, we're not doctors, we can't diagnose you. You should listen to your doctors. They really do know what they're talking about.  Feeling like everyone else has real reasons but you don't is completely normal. A LOT of people feel that way after a PTSD diagnosis.   I can also say that everything you're describing certainly fits under the description of abuse and trauma. Personally, I had to get away from my family before I could start getting better. We're all different though."
ptsd,3aezvo,reasonweb,2,Fri Jun 19 19:32:12 2015 UTC,I'm so sorry you have such a rough family life and a bad childhood :( everything you wrote about is a perfectly valid reason to have PTSD.

ptsd,3aezvo,sophiewophie666,2,Fri Jun 19 19:31:07 2015 UTC,"What do you guys think. Is my family right? Im just a pussy and I need to suck it up and quit being a little bitch? OR is my doctors right and that I was abused growing up and I have PTSD for real reasons?   Doctors are much more qualified to diagnose you than I or probably anyone else on an internet forum, so definitely listen to professionals over me or any other poster.  I really resonate with the last thing you said though.  I have often felt like I am a complete pansy-ass bitch for having PTSD over my child abuse.  I have felt that I am just clearly so overly-sensitive and pitiful and weak that I went and got myself traumatized over silly little things.  Some of those ""silly"" little things were actually not silly at all; I just did not remember all of them at first, and, like most child abuse victims, I minimized and dismissed it - actually people with PTSD often minimize any kind of trauma they've suffered - it is the self-protective mechanism that people use to continue to be able to repress their pain so they don't have to delve into the trauma and suffer through it.  I wonder if a part of you asked this question in the hopes that someone would say ""Yeah just get over it"" because then you could give yourself an excuse to continue to try to repress and suppress it all, rather than having to panic and grieve and rage to move through it? That's how it was for me.  I called myself a little-pansy-petal for being so ""wimpy"" about this whole abuse thing, so I wouldn't have to deal with it.  ""Sucking it up"" meant being able to continue to suppress it all and ignore the pain.  If you have just started dealing with all of this stuff, there is possibly a lot more there than you remember even right now.  For me, the most horrible memories came up first, but then a whole bunch of other bad ones came later, and eventually they got less severe, but then more severe again.  Point being, I did not even remember all of the trauma when I was first diagnosed (and I don't know remember it all either, and hopefully, never will).    PTSD is not about being weak or strong. It is a coping mechanism the brain employs for anyone dealing with fear beyond what the brain can handle at the time.  Anyone can get it, with the right set of experiences.    I understand how you feel, though."
ptsd,3aezvo,startingoverin2015,2,Fri Jun 19 21:20:27 2015 UTC,"No, no, no, you are not a pussy and need to suck it up. This behavior is abusive. PTSD is irrelevant when judging this kind of behavior; it is wrong and no one should have to deal with it. I'm not saying you do or don't have PTSD, but it wouldn't be surprising given what you dealt with growing up. Regardless this behavior is not acceptable and it should not be happening to anyone. I'm very sorry that you had to suffer through this and I think that counseling is absolutely beneficial to anyone dealing with these kind of circumstances. Your family does not sound like a loving and safe family to be around. No one should need to suck up anything that is harmful, hurtful, or just mean. Based on what you've written about your background and the information from your doctors it sounds as if you can believe in the professionals who are helping you and not the family who is traumatizing you. I hope you and your husband are able to move away as soon as possible."

First off, you don't have to isolate yourself from anything. You may choose to not be around your brothers if they are going to abuse you. It would be a much healthier choice if you did so. But, it would not be tantamount to isolating yourself. It would be avoidance of an abuser.

When I looked up those side effects, a few of them were symptoms of something potentially very dangerous and the website I was on didn't say how fast things could go south (ER docs said relatively slowly) nor at what dosages the dangerous thing could happen (ER docs said overdoses are usually required).  The site just said to contact my physician immediately, and he was out of the office/clinic since I'd noticed the side-effects in the evening.  Had I known those last bits of info or had the psychiatrist still been in his office so I could call, I'd like to think I wouldn't have panicked.    Do I sound like I'm rationalizing?  What I'm saying is knowledge shouldn't hurt, but in this case incomplete knowledge did."
ptsd,3aciqt,startingoverin2015,1 point,Fri Jun 19 09:15:47 2015 UTC,Are you able to get a third opinion? Doctors and therapists aren't perfect and it depends on what comes up in therapy (some of my stuff took years).
ptsd,3ab1m9,Jan291,8,Thu Jun 18 17:25:34 2015 UTC,"Aw, I really hate it when society looks up to child rapists. Personal pet peeve of mine.  I feel this way too.  My parents were physically and verbally and emotionally abusive to me.  I am 32 years old and also have had trouble letting go of them.    I have had financial help from them over years, though I recently cut ties with both of them.  But until I was 32, I let them help me with my financial difficulties, and was abnormally dependent on them for validation, emotional needs, and financial needs.    I very rarely talk to my family about my abusers, because of that reason that they don't want to take sides or take the side of the child abusers instead.    I have felt very ashamed for how dependent I was on my parents (still do, even though I'm not right now).  I felt ashamed for needing them so much, wanting their approval so badly, and needing their money.    I would recommend taking his money, using it for your health, and getting away from him.  I don't know how you can heal while still involved with the trauma-inducers.  Plus, PTSD is a tricky thing - for it to be able to happen, your brain must feel it is currently safe enough to start fully processing the trauma.  I imagine continuing any contact with the trauma-inducers would limit your own brain's ability to feel safe enough to continue with the trauma-processing."
ptsd,3ab1m9,startingoverin2015,5,Thu Jun 18 18:29:23 2015 UTC,"I would recommend taking his money, using it for your health, and getting away from him.    Yes this is a concern of mine and something that I have mixed feelings about. I realize that before I did not want to keep my feelings hidden and just take his money or be under his control in any way because feeling submissive reminded me of the abuse and made me feel degraded. I know that that is partly the PTSD/flashbacks talking though, as I have seen a lot of survivors struggle with pretending to be submissive under any circumstances (even if secretly resisting) for some reason this seems to be triggering to a lot of us. Thanks for your advice.    I don't know how you can heal while still involved with the trauma-inducers. Plus, PTSD is a tricky thing - for it to be able to happen, your brain must feel it is currently safe enough to start fully processing the trauma. I imagine continuing any contact with the trauma-inducers would limit your own brain's ability to feel safe enough to continue with the trauma-processing.   I can identify with this. When I was at university away from them and partly dependent on a government loan I did not feel as ashamed. It was complicated though because my father was constantly sending people who looked up to him to harass me and it was degrading every time someone would urge me to have contact with him. I have a feeling that he was may have also been contacting my professors or getting people to talk to them, just from the attitude of one person."
ptsd,3ab1m9,Cool_cool_beans,3,Thu Jun 18 23:55:18 2015 UTC,I've recently came across the address of my first childhood abuser after he got out of prison and I look at it everyday with the urge to write to him or something. I honestly don't know what I would even say but I just have this deep down need to make some sort of contact with him. Maybe I just want to know if he even remembers who I am or maybe I just want him to know that even after so many years I still haven't forgotten him. I use to think all the time about writing him while he was in prison (for an unrelated sexual assualt). It does make me feel crazy and shitty for having  the desire to want to talk to him and it makes me feel even more...not normal? I don't know if I ever would but the urge has been there for so many years.
ptsd,3ab1m9,randy_buttcheese,2,Fri Jun 19 00:42:18 2015 UTC,"I am sorry to hear that you feel not normal for feeling like that. I think that wanting to confront an abuser is a healthy feeling and something that many people feel. I would classify it differently (and as traumatic bonding) if you were feeling fond of him and like you wanted to be friends or have a relationship. Granted you have a right to feel the way you feel, if you feel abnormally bonded to him for wanting to contact him then that's fair enough."

ptsd,3ab1m9,resealableplasticbag,0,Mon Jun 22 21:49:19 2015 UTC,"Sure, helpful for pedophiles and child abusers to excuse their abusiveness. Do you know that the author Carnes sexually assaulted his sister ? He also quote pedophilia promoter John Money in it. The title of the book is ironic, people reading this book are betraying themselves, engaging in a betrayal bond loving Carnes and re enacting abuse. I looked at it, it is a truly awful book. The victim blaming and misogyny is off the charts. But that wouldn't matter to you since when you were sexually abused as a child, it was as a boy, not as a girl and the perpetrator did it to you as a boy and did it to you seeing you as a boy regardless of how you saw yourself."
ptsd,3a9lnt,startingoverin2015,7,Thu Jun 18 09:03:44 2015 UTC,"As other people have said, grounding exercises help me.  The one that I use has me go through all of my senses, one by one:  I see my laptop on the table in front of me.  I hear birds chirping outside and traffic driving by.  I feel my weight on the couch and a muscle in my hip starting to cramp.  I don't smell anything.  I taste the aftertaste of my coffee.  Then I take a look around and try to put myself in the moment:  I'm sitting in my apartment, writing a post on reddit.  It's 2015.  I'm not in any danger.  I am moving forward and I will be okay.  It's hard for me to remember to do this exercise, when I get dissociated.  It takes practice to have that be the go-to instead of doing my normal space-out.  I took a suggestion from an article I read about forming good habits and changed one of my frequently typed passwords to something to do with grounding, so I have that reminder a couple times a day.  I also wrote myself a reminder on my bathroom mirror so I see that in the morning and before I go to bed at night.  Hope some of this helps."

What you're trying to do is build a line between where you sit and things tangible to build a ground. You can do this for wherever your body makes contact with something else. The idea is that you're tracing where your body sits in relation to everything else.*   It may be different than what you're experiencing but it could work. Hope that helps. Keep trucking!"

My counselor told me that grounding myself with sensations helps. When possible, I try eating, smelling something like perfume, touching a fuzzy blanket, and playing music. Sometimes music makes it worse because it just becomes too much and I kind of get ""lost"" in it. Personally, eating helps the most. The other thing my counselor suggested was ""taking inventory"" of where I was. I'll try to describe where I am like ""I'm in my house sitting on my chair, at my desk, looking at my window."" Some of this stuff is kind of hard to do when you're experiencing dissociation, but you could give it a try."

It wasn't until I imposed a rigid schedule and some positive, tangible changes to the direction my life took that I pulled myself out of dissociating, crying, sulking on a daily basis. I got a new job, started working out, began reading again. Imposing a schedule/sticking to it until it began to feel natural was huge. It seems minor but it truly pulled me out of a dark place.. you seem to be doing everything right, but maybe finding more ways to fill your time and not let the cycle of losing time even begin is the next step towards regaining your footing.

The day before I try and just act normal, take a sedative leave all the stuff I need to take at the front door and a set of clothing to wear at the end of the bed.  I purposefully wear clothing that will be easy to go through security with. No belts, slip on shoes, no metal.  I bring my meds in my carry on, in their original packaging with my name on them and the prescription I got with them. I normally carry a copy of a letter that has my diagnosis on it, just in case.  I take sedatives before I leave the house, and when I get on the plane and when it's landing.  Depending on where I'm going I plan ahead again, several weeks in advance, on ways I can be alone if I need to be. And arrange time each day to practice mindfulness alone.

But, being in a confined space with a bunch of men makes me feel trapped and unsafe. The pre-travel stress definitely doesn't help. Personally the thing that helps me the most in planes is to sit in the aisle seat and by people I know. I also like sitting near an exit. I also like organizing the space around my seat to try to put myself at ease. For travel in cars, it helps for me to lie down in the backseat and take frequent stops, so I don't feel as trapped."

So I have not had trouble traveling, and I have traveled internationally since being diagnosed. Most of my anxiety is due to flashbacks in my head, and unfortunately my head is everywhere with me, so it does not matter where I am location wise - neither country, city, plane, train, sidewalk, restaurant, home, boat, etc.. etc… In my case my panic attacks are random, and get triggered by very small things that are everywhere - so traveling for me does not add extra stress then what is already there.

I cannot recommend it highly enough, but it is the most painful, yet cathartic therapy I've ever been through.    It works.  It's painful.  And if your therapist is good, you will be working to solve the reasons of your pain and not just trying to cure the symptoms.  Your first session should be a familiarization, which should ease you into the process, followed by therapy on steroids.  I have never cried so hard in my life; I have never thought I would have achieved so much in so little time.  Please PM me if you have questions.

I will say this - please make sure you find a therapist with years of experience with using EMDR to treat PTSD under her/his belt. The first time I wanted to try EMDR was about 10-15 yrs ago and the only person I could find was a gal who had just graduated college and was still under supervision. It was such a waste of time and money.

ptsd,3a8sa6,Drabbeynormalblues,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:20:07 2015 UTC,"EMDR is a concentrated way (in my experience) of getting you ready to handle whatever ""it"" is.  Whatever traumatized you will always be a sad memory, but the point of not just treating the symptoms (i.e. medications and/or relaxation exercises) and carving out the real root of your pain will change your perspective of the past to help you lead a fuller, less traumatized life.  When I started therapy, I knew something was wrong, but I didn't know what.  I just knew I was anxious ALL the time, having nightmares, nausea, etc.  Now, I know exactly what's wrong (combat PTSD), and EMDR is helping me fight it.    My symptoms have shifted.  I don't get nearly as anxious or scared nowadays, because I know what I'm dealing with.  Still, I'm constantly depressed and prone to flashbacks because I am hyper aware of my PTSD and its causes.  But finally, FINALLY, there's a light at the tunnel, and after years of pain I'm seeing a real difference in my life and believe I have a future.  With EMDR, I am earning my freedom, because it is so heavy.  But it's exactly what I want.  (And don't get me wrong, I'm not a tough guy preaching bravado.  I've had multiple sessions where I walked in and told my therapist, ""No EMDR.  Not today"".  Go at your own pace; once you start seeing the benefits, it'll drive you forward.)"

ptsd,3a8sa6,The_Big_Salad,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:30:44 2015 UTC,"It didn't work for me either. Today was my second session and during the process, it seemed subconscious material just didn't ""come up"" for me. We've decided to proceed with regular talk therapy for now, in the hopes that with a stronger clinician-client relationship it will be more effective. Do you have any insights into why it didn't work for you?"
ptsd,3a8sa6,Wikipodiatrist,2,Thu Jun 18 05:47:06 2015 UTC,"I guess I had sort of the opposite problem? Ended up getting retraumatized and basically set back to square one after years of progress. It was really awful.   Not meaning to put you or anyone anyone else off, but it's a good idea to be aware of possible complications and risks when heading into this kind of treatment. I hope you find something that works out for you!"
ptsd,3a8sa6,The_Big_Salad,1 point,Thu Jun 18 05:55:31 2015 UTC,Becoming retraumatized is definitely my biggest concern right now. Thanks for the heads up.
ptsd,3a8sa6,Wikipodiatrist,2,Thu Jun 18 21:06:05 2015 UTC,"subconscious material just didn't ""come up"" for me.   It took my subconscious a while to feel safe enough with my counselor to let the trauma really come up. I could certainly /talk/ about it, intellectually, but the actual trauma didn't start coming out until just this week. When it did finally emerge, it was really fucking intense. I think it's actually a good thing it took me a while to get to that point because I now know/trust she is ""safe.""  She called to check on me yesterday and as soon as I heard her voice it all started coming up and out again. I really think that's because of that safe space and trust we've created."
ptsd,3a8sa6,Olioliooo,1 point,Sat Jun 20 10:54:47 2015 UTC,That's what my counselor thinks too. How long did it take with yours?
ptsd,3a8sa6,LeopardBernstein,1 point,Sat Jun 20 14:22:50 2015 UTC,"I'll tell you, but please don't think my situation is standard.  It wasn't until my ninth session that I was able to access the raw pain from one of my PTSD events.  I'm only seeing my counselor every other week. (I was on a waiting list to get in to see her, and this was all she had available. She prefers to do this kind of work weekly.) After my first session, I didn't see her until 6 weeks later due to snow storms and cold/flu season. I spent the first couple of sessions explaining my past. Then one session we needed to talk about a guy I was dating who was being extremely manipulative & how to kick him to the curb. Then one session landed on the anniversary of major traumatic event, so that topic took center stage. Then there was some (present-day) family dysfunction that came up that we processed. Then I had a major falling out with my best friend, so that took a couple of sessions...  It's probably a good thing that all of these roadblocks came up because the time we took working on all that ""on the surface"" stuff helped me trust my counselor more and we really established a safe space.  All that other stuff going on in my life has settled down, and just last Sunday I started having PTSD/flashbacks/anxiety, seemingly ""out of nowhere,"" and I was fully ready to start digging in and doing the hard work during this week's session.  Good golly, it is NOT a comfortable process - but I know I need to keep at it if I want to fully heal. And it helps to have the sense that I absolutely 100% trust my counselor now.  We actually did try to start the EMDR in an earlier session, but I can see now that I was clearly avoidant at the time and not feeling safe enough to ""go there.""  My advice: go at your own pace. :)  And trust the wisdom of that pace. Your psyche will unlock when and if you're ready - and not a moment sooner."
ptsd,3a8sa6,LeopardBernstein,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:29:19 2015 UTC,This sounds a lot like my situation. I see a University counselor and can only see him every other week or less. My personal and family life right now is nothing short of a clusterf@&$. I will give myself time :)
ptsd,3a8sa6,Drabbeynormalblues,3,Tue Jun 23 08:51:07 2015 UTC,"Hey, I had PTSD since I was 16. Around the age of 19 I tried two different therapists for EMDR. One was being trained, and didn't really know what he was doing. The second really knew what she was doing, and we were able to essentially treat my condition/get it under control in just a few months. I was also doing this about three days a week, which was nice. If you trust your therapist's expertise, you'll get a lot done.   Honestly, I don't really think the eye movement gimmick was what did the job. Either way, it was part of the treatment, and as a whole it worked wonders for me. I went from being unable to leave my room to get to classes, to becoming a functional human being.  10/10 would desensitize again."
ptsd,3a8sa6,startingoverin2015,2,Thu Jun 18 13:14:22 2015 UTC,"I have experienced it, and am in training to be a counselor - and get EMDR training as well.  It seems the crux of the issue is how much work the therapist has done, as a therapist can only bring a client as far as they feel comfortable.  There's this natural barrier that exists, that if a therapist's comfort zone is exceeded, they almost naturally rebuff progress because internal fear is sensed through non verbal communications.  The client then experiences something similar to a parent expressing fear when they get hurt - which is that ""traumatization"" gets modeled.    Expect the best, and be ready if it's not the best as well.  It is really likely that good work will come up, and progress will be made.  If you make great progress, then great.  If not - there are lots of other therapies that are also very effective like EMDR now.    I also like Somatic Experiencing personally.  I have been trained in it - and it has made a big difference for me.  SE is especially good for traumas that have little known memory roots, that talking just can't access.  All of these therapies are related though in the ""experiential"" category.  You have support, and this is likely to be really good, and if not, there's more to do!  Good therapy is kinda like a good diet, it's about finding a new way to live and process, not really fix anything.  When we have acceptance for ourselves - we learn to do our own processing, and a therapist is just the person you hire to keep you safe while you explore (if one is even needed)."

ptsd,3a9hxe,airyesmad,1 point,Thu Jun 18 08:07:12 2015 UTC,"If you are looking for information about the effects of the trauma on your sister for witnessing your mother's violence against you, you are more likely to find pertinent information by searching ""children witnessing domestic violence"".  This will mainly be articles dealing with children witnessing an abusive parent act violently towards his/her spouse.  However, the effects will be very similar on your sister for witnessing violence from a mother against you.    Is that what you are looking for?"

ptsd,3a9olt,airyesmad,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:57:50 2015 UTC,"I can relate. The most helpful thing I've found is to remind myself that this disorder is like having an old injury flare up (actually exactly what it is), and that I need to do the mental equivalent of resting and packing it in ice until it gets better, etc. I wouldn't keep walking or try and run while it hurts, and just blame myself for the pain—that'd be silly.  These thoughts and feelings and states of mind really hurt and are so overwhelming...any time I'm able to recognize it, remember that the truth is bigger than how I feel right now, and actually transcend it mentally (i.e. not be controlled by it) I feel very fortunate. I run for exercise but also for self-care, and I can't tell you how many times I have forced myself to get up, leave my bed, leave the house, and fought myself with every ounce of my being every step of the way until I did it, and it made an enormous difference—it's just as important to me as taking my medication now. If you've got similar tools, fight to take your day back if possible. Hope you're feeling better."

ptsd,3a8alc,cyanoside,4,Thu Jun 18 00:38:49 2015 UTC,"My good buddy said to me   ""Codee, was superman brave""   I knew him to ask thought provoking questions so I thought before answering and said ""no."" He asked me why not.   I said that most of the time he was ""heroic"" he knew that no harm would come to him. His one and only weakness was kryptonite. He couldn't ask out the woman he loved as himself. He hid. Yes, he had brave moments when he faced kryptonite but other than that hell no he wasn't brave.   Then my buddy looked at me and said ""and you don't date why?.....""   It hit me. I didn't date because it was (in my flawed thinking) weak to need someone. I was strong because I took care of myself, I didn't NEED anyone.   One freaking question and my world view blew apart. My biological mother abused me horribly so I had the same theory, the less people I care about, the less people can hurt me.   That was almost 20 years ago now. I've been in relationships, friendships and jobs and have been hurt. I've said the wrong thing on reddit and been hung out to dry. I still (for the most part) go out there, put myself out there. I made a new friend in the past couple of months! It does scare the shit out of me, to be vulnerable to hurt... But the brave part is the dusting yourself off, saying well that sucked, and going forward.   Now I'm with my partner of five years, job of three years and friends both new and old. I would have been a lot less hurt had I kept my walls up but I would be nowhere near where I am today. I'm happy I'm here, it was worth it. Maybe tomorrow my partner will turn and rip my heart out but that's a chance I'm choosing to take because I'm choosing to be brave and LIVE."

ptsd,3a8alc,startingoverin2015,5,Thu Jun 18 08:18:52 2015 UTC,"Me too.   For me, the first thing I do is accept that I feel this way, and that that is ok. I have every reason and every right not to trust people.  I think a lot of people add pain on top of pain by first feeling mistrustful, but then berating themselves for feeling mistrustful, and then even worse, trying to force themselves to trust.    This is a terrible way to go about it.  I accept that I do not trust people.  And that attitude has, very often in my life, successfully protected me. Now, it's made me lonely as all fuck, but it has protected me.  So I thank my mistrusting instincts for all of their help and protection over the years, and I feel grateful for these feelings.  Then I start to recognize my paranoia/suspicious/mistrustful thoughts, and I remind myself that they are just thoughts and they are just feelings. I do not have to obey them.  I let the thoughts go through my head, I let the feelings go through my body, and I sometimes obey the thoughts and feelings, as with a strong instinctual impulse to protect myself, or I ignore my thoughts and feelings and act in a manner that is more healthy for myself.    I take time to think over the people I am quick to write-off for being disloyal or untrustworthy.  I take space and distance to think things through on my own before cutting ties with/flipping out on someone.  I go over my ""evidence"" for their disloyalty with a couple of trusted friends and/or the professional help of my therapist. I get a few counteracting opinions, just to see if I am being realistic.    I make sure never to ignore an instinct.  They are there for good reason.  But other than that, thoughts are just thoughts and feelings are just feelings. I accept them, am grateful for their help and protection, and I follow or ignore them as appropriate."
ptsd,3a8alc,airyesmad,3,Thu Jun 18 08:51:57 2015 UTC,"I hope I'm not sharing too much. But I had an incident that involved a christmas tree falling on me and mother angry about the ornaments I broke and events ensuing. My therapist asked me what I thought a different mother's first reaction would be. I said something along the lines of any other type of punishment, like time out or something.  And she said that her reaction, if that were her little girl, would be panic and ""Oh my gosh!"" and then rush to make sure she was okay.   The thought had never once crossed my mind. Concern for the safety of that little girl. It just kinda... I don't know. Knowing that she should have cared, but just knowing that there are people that would have cared for that little girl. It was a huge release."

I have personally been working on my PTSD since last August, almost a year now. This time last year death seemed like a better option than what I was going through. I started EMDR and brainspotting and I can honestly say I feel much better. At first though, it almost seemed worse. Digging up old sexual trauma isn't easy. It is terrible for your body and mind to go through. It sounds cheesy, but it's almost like it had to get worse before it could get better. Is there a way you could go consistently and perhaps twice a week? I really feel for you and I hope you get better. It's hard work but it is worth it."
ptsd,3a7p72,start_again,2,Thu Jun 18 03:29:05 2015 UTC,Thanks so much for taking the time to reply. I really appreciate it. I don't want to die or anything. I want to get better. I'm just so scared of what's going to happen if this keeps getting worse. Sometimes it just feels like my brain is going to break. I feel so out of control and I don't feel like myself. Im scared one day I'll just break down in public and won't ever recover from it. But it gives me so much hope to know that other people have gotten better. I really hope that a year from now I'll be in a better place then I am now. I started seeing my counselor twice a week. Hopefully it will help. This is the hardest thing I've ever done.

ptsd,3a5dj3,startingoverin2015,11,Wed Jun 17 10:37:47 2015 UTC,"Everyone has different experiences.  Also, there will always be someone who will have had a ""more traumatic"" experience, and if you get into comparison of histories, no one will ever feel like they have had enough trauma to have ""PTSD"" or talk about it.  I only say this because I lived a life in denial of my issues because I thought I wasn't traumatized enough.  In a way, engaging in comparison of stories is just a way your brain protects you from having to feel the current feelings you have.  For example:  ""I wasn't a Holocaust survivor, so I shouldn't feel like someone is trying to kill me all of the time.""  When it comes to helping a person, you don't even need to share your story or your history, sometimes a nice, ""I've been there, and I'm listening."" will suffice.  Just because you haven't had that direct experience of combat, doesn't mean you don't know what it's like to live in fear for your life.  This is what empathy is.  It helps people.

Or I have written posts here that I thought were just me rambling about nonsense and not stringing complete sentences together etc, but it will resonate with someone in some way.

As for the ""I have not gone through enough to say something here"": I believe that thinking that comes from ptsd. It seems to be a form of not taking oneself important, of low self esteem.  Maybe try to look at it this way: by definition, anyone who has post traumatic stress disorder has gone through a (or several) trauma(s). Trauma is the most extreme kind of experience there is. Having gone through the slightest trauma lets you relate to the worst traumas so very much better, than anyone who never went through any trauma ever could.

Sometimes when I used to get really down I'd call a friend and see if they wanted to do something simple like go to the grocery store, or i'd go for a walk, colour (sounds funny but a good distraction) and really just have a bunch of activities available in the event I needed them. Almost like planning for a long trip. I got through a lot of the kinds of times you're describing by essentially having a toolbox/list of things to do, people to talk to, scheduled tasks. Going for a walk to get a coffee to start the day can change your whole perspective. Hang in."

ptsd,3a32wq,Carpe_Noche,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:49:33 2015 UTC,"If I could offer some advice, it would be to try to do one thing a day that forces you out of your comfort zone - even if it's just walking to the store. And then on the days that you feel a bit better, walk a little further. You'll get there. It's a long road and you'll go backwards a lot of the time, but if you keep moving you won't fall in between the cracks."
ptsd,3a5nxd,youngandaimless_,8,Wed Jun 17 12:41:59 2015 UTC,"PTSD isn't limited to those who were in combat. You should ask a qualified professional, such as a doctor or therapist, about your situation."
ptsd,3a5nxd,secondcookie,2,Wed Jun 17 13:43:23 2015 UTC,"Hopefully you don't have PTSD exactly. PTSD is if it's been months or years since the trauma and you're still confused, like you've settled into a pattern of confusion. It's more common when a stress disturbs you to go pretty much back to normal within a few months. Being upset less than a week after something scared you is normal and doesn't mean it won't fade soon. If you keep gradually exposing yourself to your triggers they'll probably start to weaken. If necessary expose yourself more gently, like touch slightly warm water and then a little warmer while giving yourself lots of space to process the fear."
ptsd,3a5nxd,mungojelly,2,Wed Jun 17 17:20:07 2015 UTC,"PTSD is experiencing symptoms over a longer period of time.  To put it simply, your brain just learned that certain environments (the kitchen or the bathroom) are dangerous.  In order to prevent future injury, the brain wants you to avoid such environments.  So, the unpleasant feelings are a way of your brain trying to communicate to your body to ""Get the F out"" so to speak.  Depending on the severity of your symptoms you may need to seek professional help.  If it feels okay, you may expose yourself to such triggers in small doses.  Just make sure you stop if it gets too intense, and take some really deep breaths."

It is worth having a conversation with your boyfriend about this if you haven't already, and exploring possible ways he can help (besides just respecting your need to leave the situation).  A good partner will be able to understand on some level, and (this cannot be overstated) respect how you are feeling!  You shouldn't have to worry about ""ruining"" an adventurous bonding experience for the two of you.    You can't prepare for everything though, and ultimately it is going to come down to you looking out for yourself and knowing your own needs.  It helps me to be around a lot of people I trust in my situation, and ultimately makes me feel safe, regardless of most situations.

Flash backs to the event or forgetting parts of it that you previously remembered such as small details?  I think you should see someone ASAP. 3 months is relatively early and your symptoms may progressively get worse if you don't address them.

I made a psychiatrist appointment a month ago and its in 2 weeks.    Nightmares or trouble sleeping? Any distrust of loved ones or hyper vigilance? Flash backs to the event or forgetting parts of it that you previously remembered such as small details?   Nightmares, no, but trouble sleeping, yes. For the first month I felt so constantly tense that I would lay in bed and not be able to sleep for 2+ hours, then unintentionally wake up after only 3-4 hours of sleep and not be able to fall asleep again. Distrust of loved ones and hypervigilance, yes. I live with my brother (partially responsible for my breakdown) and parents, and instead of believing like they wanted the best for me I started interpreting everything as a personal slant, like they are trying to bring me down. Hypervigilance, yes. I used to go to the gym and and work out regularly, then after the event, I was surprised when I could not be in the gym room with other people without shaking and feeling extremely nervous. No flash backs, no loss of memory- at least I don't think so. But my memory has certainly changed, I am less able to retain information or learn nowadays. I just seek to keep myself constantly occupied or delved into the Internet to avoid the persistent agitation and discomfort I feel.   Thankfully, I have started sleeping a little better. In the past 2 weeks, I've had 3 or 4 good nights sleep for the first time in 3 months, so that's nice. Thanks for your comment and your care, and I hope you are doing good too."

ptsd,39ytoz,EmeraldX3,3,Mon Jun 15 22:07:57 2015 UTC,"I agree with /u/Pippafert on finding a new shrink or not going to one at all. If you don't feel like they are helping you but making you feel worse, you should not be continuing the cycle of mental anguish. Just feeds the monster that is PTSD.  I'm assuming you live in the United States, if you do and live in a college town that has a psychology department, chances are they have a community outreach program so you can go see a grad student to help them through their training and are overseen by a licensed professional. It's much more affordable and they are usually closely monitored, so if you feel that someone isn't helping but hurting you can be placed with another person and build a safe environment.  I've been where you are...not exactly like you, but then again I'm a different person with a different life. But your words impacted me and reminded me of some of my more darker times. The depression just ate at me, made me push everyone away. I was alone and didn't want to get on with life. Then I forced myself to go out one day to find one last bit of happiness before I pulled the life support plug on my own life. I went out and got a cupcake from a local bakery. I'm really clumsy and when I'm depressed I am even more clumsy. I dropped the cupcake on the floor, icing side down. I stared at the carnage and that was it, that was the moment that I snapped. I dropped to the floor and bawled my eyes out in a bakery.  The sweet woman that worked there came over to me, rubbed my back and cleaned up the mess while I bawled my eyes out. She even closed turned the open sign to closed. I apologized but she kept waving her hand at me. She brought me another cupcake, led me to a table and took my hands in hers and asked me if I was okay.  I told her I wasn't and was very open about the fact that I some issues and was just having a rough time. She listened to my life story for a good half hour. Turns out she was a retired psychologist and this was her dream job to own a bakery. She didn't call the cops to hospitalize me or anything, she just told me to come see her the next day for another cupcake. She wanted to hear more about my life. That bakery woman saved my life, because for one second out of all the seconds of suffering, someone was kind enough to let me be my worst and accept me just as I was - human.  Long story short, fuck being patient. Patience doesn't do anything except make you feel more alone. You have to get on your feet and you have to make life happen. Even if it scares the living piss out of you, you have to do it. You have to drop the cupcake, you have to find your wits end to know that you are still capable of living. That the world is still full of kindness, compassion and understanding.  I'm not good at giving advice, I'm still trying to understand myself and how I fit into the world. And many days I just feel so out of place and distorted, but I remind myself that I am a cupcake and sometimes I fall icing down on the floor. I'm imperfect, but I'm a worthwhile person who deserves to live my life, pursue my dreams and cry my eyes out when shit gets too real.  I'm here for you. I'm an internet person, but I'm here. For the last whole of my life it seems I've been battling anxiety and depression with cracked, rusty armor. But I'm still winning the fight, because I want to."

It is not included in the DSM-V/ICD-10 as it is still clinically under investigation and research, but is recognized medically as different symptomatically from PTSD (per my psychiatrist and therapist, and I have a PDF report from a clinical journal as well somewhere).  Not having the developmental history is difficult, but not insurmountable. Especially given your history of abuse and mental trauma; you can still be diagnosed without (autism spectrum have physiological as well as psychiatric components, hence the multi-specialty treatment).  Per my therapist, the way a child learns is via feeling. That creates emotional anchors that help draw your experiences later. That you cannot remember anything but a pervasive sense of fear/dread/pain is not surprising, as it would have enveloped and encompassed your formative periods. Hence, the blanks.  Really, the best thing you can do is to trust your MHPs and ask that they keep you informed. They do this for a living, and are trained to do so. Your background doesn't stop that, and it certainly will not stop you."

ptsd,39mjxz,cyanoside,3,Sat Jun 13 04:02:20 2015 UTC,"A great resource I found about CPTSD when I was diagnosed 2 years ago: http://www.pete-walker.com/fAQsComplexPTSD.html .   A book/psychologist I recommend as well is Peter Levine's Waking the Tiger. http://www.amazon.com/Waking-Tiger-Peter-A-Levine/dp/155643233X . It's all about how the body holds trauma and how there is a lot of positive hope in that, because there are techniques for accessing that trauma and letting it flow out of you. I know it sounds a little hippy-dippy, but it's actually incredibly true in my experience. My therapist mentioned in one session and she takes many of her techniques from his approach, and let me tell you, in just 2 year I am healthier and happier than I ever thought POSSIBLE. There is so much hope! Hang in there.   Finding a really good therapist who has a lot of experience in trauma (and specifically childhood abuse) is your first and most important step. On the psychologytoday.com website you can search for therapists based on specialties. When you call prospective therapists to ask them questions and start making first appointments, have a list of questions ready, such as, ""have you treated many patients with childhood trauma,"" ""what were their outcomes like,"" ""what is your treatment approach,"" and so on. Don't assume that one type of degree for a therapist is better than another, for instance, I had several PhDs before I found a Liscensed Clinical Social Worker who is the best fit EVER for me. It's also very likely you don't know what kind of therapy approach you will need right now. I recommend going to a couple different therapists if you can until you get that comfortable feeling. You will know if it feels right and if you feel safe and comfortable with the person pretty quickly.  Also the focus of treatment is not ""recovering the memories,"" that does not actually help you heal and gain emotion management skills. Learning to safely encounter your emotions and feel safe inside of your own body and therefore learn to work through dissociation is your main goal in treatment. All kinds of positive changes will flow from learning to be safely embodied. For instance, on the first appointment with my therapist, we focused on breathing. I left feeling much more calm and aware, even though I was a jumble of emotions and pretty much dissociated ~80% of my waking life. In treatment, the memories that need to come to the surface will come to the surface. In the meantime, I gained skills of mindfulness and awareness of how to behave and think that helped to facilitate positivity, growth, and insight into my patterns and triggers.  I'm not sure about the Asperger's stuff, but I often found myself wondering if I was on the spectrum too. It might just be part of C-PTSD experience. I think your first and best bet right now is to find an experienced therapist to work through this stuff at a safe pace and in a safe environment. If something like the spectrum is becoming clear, your therapist will notice this and will professionally address that if it is present.  You asked a lot of questions in your post, so I'm not sure if I can address them all. But as someone who has been in therapy for a few years for C-PTSD and had MANY of the same concerns as you entering into it, I am happy to talk to you in private messages.   EDIT: I know you said you have a therapist and psychiatrist in your post, and that's really great! I got a little confused when I was typing in my rush to tell you about finding a therapist who is truly a good fit. But also, my therapist never had to get a family history from me and it doesn't hinder her treatment of me at all (her method is psychodynamic and relational, I believe).  EDIT 2: I was really concerned about remembered the details about my mom abusing me at the beginning of treatment too. But that is never the focus in the sessions. Sure, the memories come up as I am re-experiencing the emotions, but I also let go of the need to know it all, and my therapist doesn't have me say them out loud unless I feel I need to. I realize I will have huge holes of my memory of my childhood forever maybe, and I'm ok with that. Because I am taking good care of myself now, and I am not a vulnerable child in that awful situation anymore. I'm an adult and I'm safe and I'm getting so much better every. damn. day. I'm expereincing joy and satisfaction I never knew could be real, like, I didn't even know people could even feel this good. I didn't know feeling base-line contented was a realm of human experience. Trust me, it gets so much better, and improvements will happen faster than you realize."

But I think you have everything you need to start getting help from your psychologist person: what you feel right now. A good mental health person should be able to work from that.  To my understanding, psychology is not an exact science. A diagnosis is less about you fitting the diagnosis and more about how the diagnosis fits you - and how it helps you feel about yourself.

Since the abuser is a liar who is denying everything I do remember but admitted to a group of my friends that she'd pin me down when I ""tantrumed"" (possible ASD meltdowns), I don't know what else happened. I remembered being more scared of certain family members than others. Why? Why was I so frightened of the weird uncle who lived with us when I was small?  There's been lies and lies and more lies told to me by the abuser and probably others. I don't remember anything in vivid detail except what she did last year at my flat warming when we had to call the police and I wound up crying in the bathroom and then inside my freaking wardrobe. Even that's fading.   So what went on, I don't know. I don't know how I forget so much and others remember."

Some times I can even go back asleep pretty quickly too because I simply can't let my mind wander anywhere bad when futurama wants attention and fills my head with other things and my horror is suddenly far away.

I know music also works for some even though both these things are counter indicated by every shrink or sleep therapist / hygienist would insist.

A show or movie that I know every second of to the extent even the audio will never suprise or startle me but still brings me a huge amount of comfort is pretty much the only external stimulant that works for me. If it demands any form of attention it removes my sleepiness completely.

Tell them what the symptoms are like. Sometimes they can give you another medication to take with the one you're already on so that you can get through the side effects. And sometimes, they'll just switch you to something else.   If you haven't already, you should check with your regular doctor about your diet and the amount of exercise you get. Those two things can be huge factors in the healing process.   I will say that the Lexapro made me incredibly sleepy. I tried it for a couple of weeks, but we determined that it was just making things worse. But that's ok. Now we know that one doesn't work and it's time to move on to something else.   And about the youtube videos and other comments. People tend to complain about their meds when it's awful, but it's far more rare for people to come back and say 'Hey! Now that I've gotten past the initial side effects, things are a lot better.' Even though that happens a lot.   So, TL;DR Talk to your doctor. Hang in there.

The one time I was given it (post-surgery, prior to me knowing I was allergic) I almost died and my pain got considerably worse. Does that make it a poor drug for post-operative analgesia? Of course not.  Take it as prescribed consistently, stay in touch with your psych, and stay in touch with yourself. Nothing else is relevant, really."

ptsd,39cik1,liminallime,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:58:23 2015 UTC,The way I've handled it is to   Tell my SO what is happening.  I say what I'm feeling and that I don't know what's triggering it. At first it was super embarrassing because PTSD can make me go off the cliff so quickly and I wanted to hide it from him so he didn't think I was nuts and to protect him.  But he was very loving and more often than not the connection helped me to come down. Dig into those feelings in therapy and find physical ways to vent the anger.  Exercise is good but sometimes it's not aggressive enough - my best vent is to whack the crap out of my mattress with a broom until I'm tired and calmer. If I can't articulate well to my SO in the moment I let him know I'm triggered and then I withdraw.  Later when I can talk I will.   One thing I found was that my feelings were so intense and painful I wanted to hold them all in because I didn't want others to suffer.  Turns out that my feelings don't bother other people nearly as much as I thought. Theres a big difference between feeling anger and using SO as the target and sharing feelings of anger WITH them.  When I do that my husband is very supportive.    I hope I answered your question- feel free to PM any time

I hope that you can find something of benefit in it, though.   It's cliche, but the key has been finding a way of challenging myself in a rewarding way.    All my life, I hated public speaking.  I literally used to avoid lucrative opportunities if even the moderate possibility of speaking in front of others was there; no matter how friendly the setting or small the audience.  But I always sensed that I could do it well if I could just overcome the panic attacks that public speaking caused.   Well, one day, I forced myself to do it. It sucked and did not go perfectly.  You know how you read that the audience can't tell that a nervous speaker is nervous?  That wasn't true, in my case.  I stumbled.  Sweat dripped.  I raced through my words at times.  I'm pretty sure my pulsating heart was visible against my shirt.   Despite all that, my speech's point was communicated, though not artfully.  So I was convinced that, at least objectively speaking, it was a success. And I figured if I could make speaking work despite those horrible conditions, then I must have some aptitude for it.   To cut to the chase, I'll tell you that I now love public speaking and get a thrill out of my ability to compel others.   But it's still a fragile balance.  And that's where the fear described in another post ( https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/3dn13w/my_new_fear/ ) comes in.  I am so, so scared that drinking will wake me from this dream and return me to the shell of the person I once was.    As a total side note, I should also point out that the consequences aren't all good, though the positive changes very much outweigh the bad.  For example, my new confidence is probably occasionally perceived as arrogance, and may well be.  And since this is all new to me, I sometimes manipulate people when I am just trying to persuade them.  If that makes sense.

I think if you felt less ashamed you would probably be angry for a little while but the anger wouldn't go on. It would run its course fairly quickly.  I remember not being able to sleep for months on end because I was so angry and I felt like people did not truly understand my anger because they did not care about what happened to me and they weren't making any effort to change the situation.

Mostly because when I was a kid, I more or less got conditioned into learning that even if I'm angry, someone else is always more angry and they're going to hurt me more, so it's pointless in being angry. Also, being angry for me implies some sort of violation of boundaries happened to cause the anger, but in my head, I don't have boundaries to violate (i.e., I don't have the right to boundaries).

If you dont feel comfortable or trusting of the EMDR therapist, push it back. Dont rush into something youre uncomfortable with. EMDR was VERY helpful in my situation in just a few weeks of therapies. I will say the EMDR sessions were unexpectedly mentally exhausting and i usually required a lengthy nap afterwards. It always felt like i guess a subconsious re-wiring if you will. I could tell i was changing positively but nothing i could put my finger on exactly. Id do EMDR again in a heartbeat. But again it HAS to be someone you know you trust. Best of luck"

ptsd,39ax69,BBBTech,1 point,Thu Jun 11 11:55:41 2015 UTC,"I know exactly how you feel. I have these moments I call ""crashes"" where I remember some silly mistake or social awkwardness and I feel so terrible about it the memory alone just overwhelms me. One of the things therapy has helped me realize is how unhealthy my solution to these moments was; I basically internally shout ""just kill yourself"" when I feel that way. Telling myself to kill myself is basically how I deal with shame and stress. I never imagine committing suicide or self-injure. I simply tell myself to kill myself on almost a daily basis. It reminds me of depression, in that it feels bad but there's something very warm and comforting about it.  I'm working really hard on softening that response (understatement), but it's very hard to spend a lifetime hating yourself then try and turn that narrative on a dime. Sorry if this isn't very helpful--I've basically been ""faking it till I make it"", or telling myself I'm okay, worthy of forgiveness and love until I believe it. It feels plastic as hell when I first do it, but the more I do it the more internalized it becomes. I actually just left an appointment where my therapist points out the internal voice telling you to love yourself is as ""fake"" as the internal voice telling you to hate yourself. Both are artificial constructs. I've just been trained to rely on the latter through abuse and neglect."

PTSD seems like a better fit because of my strong emotional and physical reactions to life events and to external stimuli. (also added a statement above, to clarify)  I am going to be looking for a new psychologist who specializes in trauma and mood disorders. Going off of what /u/nopointinsteeringnow said, these symptoms and diagnoses can overlap on the same coin."

ptsd,399w8x,umiii,2,Wed Jun 10 08:30:30 2015 UTC,"I'm in a somewhat similar position. There are a lot of indicators that some kind of sexual abuse occurred when I was around 8 or so. I questioned that conclusion a lot since I didn't have any distinct memories (only strong feelings  and some other ""empirical"" evidence like a major, unexplained personality change and intense anxiety). I had a sort of flashback/dream that pretty much convinced me I was right a few years ago and nothing since then. I've spoken with a few close friends, a partner who was abused as a child and a few therapists and this is what I've concluded:  Option 1: It did happen and I've blocked out the memories  Option 2: It didn't happen and the ""evidence"" is really just a collection of unrelated experiences that are explained by multiple answers (I inherited anxiety, school was stressful, etc etc)  Option 3: I was not directly abused but being a sensitive child I was indirectly traumatized--hearing about abuse, especially the abuse of people you are close to, can be traumatizing for a child especially if they don't have the resources to process the idea and it turns into a constant source of fear and feeling vulnerable.   I think at this point you have to ask yourself what would change about who you are and what you believe if you do remember things or you do get some kind of confirmation. Will you be ""broken forever""? Will you stop trusting? Will you be a different person than you are now? You should consider that if you were abused, knowing or not knowing might not make much of a difference. Let's assume that you were abused. You already lived through it. You've already spent decades with yourself and your body and your abuse. You are the same person now that you were yesterday. Being able to label yourself as a victim of childhood sexual abuse will not change the fact that you were abused and it won't change how you've recovered from it. I don't want to give you the impression that I don't believe you or I think you want the label or anything like that...just consider that your brain might have a very good reason for not remembering what happened and that forcing yourself to smash those protective walls apart could do more harm than good.   As for how to deal with flashbacks---  DURING:  I typically repeat a phrase to myself over and over and over until it stops. Sometimes I recite the date, time and the address of my current location. The date/time/address is a real fact about where/when I am and it helps me remember that I'm not ""back there"".   The personally meaningful phrase is tied to a strong memory---I used to say it to my horse to help her calm down when she was scared (she was always freaking out about shadows) and so it's something that I associate with one specific situation that has nothing to do with any person or trauma. It reminds me of a time when I was helping and protecting a living creature and a hobby that makes me feel strong and competent.   Both help me stay tethered to reality which doesn't mean that I'm suddenly pulled out of the torrent of memories/feelings, but it keeps me from getting swept away.   I've also found that keeping my eyes open helps. It can feel uncomfortable to keep my eyes open because of the extra sensory input but if I close my eyes, sometimes I get trapped in the idea that I might still ""be there"" and if I open my eyes I'll still be in that bedroom and my whole life since then has been an illusion. So for me, keeping my eyes open is important. You may find something different.  AFTER: I try to do something really mindless that is an act of taking care of myself. Sometimes I'll take a shower or eat something, even if it's not strictly necessary. A shot of whiskey helps, so does a cigarette, but those are less than ideal as far as coping mechanisms go because they're not really healthy in the long run but neither is prolonged anxiety so...  Sometimes talking to someone helps, sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes being touched helps, sometimes it doesn't. A lot of the recovery process is hit and miss. I would advise you to take baby steps---don't get black out drunk, don't throw yourself into the arms of a lover, don't spend $300 dollars or order the most expensive dinner you can. Go slow with whatever method you try so you can back out as soon as it feels bad. I can't tell you how many times I've gotten drunk after a bad flashback only to feel even worse from the depressant effects of alcohol. The after feeling is a special state of mind, so remember that when you're making choices about how to care for yourself. You don't want to wake up the next morning really regretting something you did to take care of yourself because that'll just really fuck up the whole process. Ideally, you wake up and you're proud of how well you treated yourself and how well you handled feeling so shitty.  Best of luck, thanks for reaching out."

I feel like this is a logical fallacy.   I know I am more emotionally sensitive than most, and like you, I always feel like I need to convince people that I'm a good person. At the heart of it, though, most people don't care. They're just trying to get on with their lives as effortlessly as possible: our PTSD is just something they don't understand. They don't care about our problems, because it's not their lives. ... This isn't meant as an insult to us or them. It's just a fact.  It's me that has a problem with judging myself, and convincing myself that I'm a good person (another fallacy). If I were able to be a stronger self-advocate, I would be acting differently. Emotionally healthy people take what they need all the time. They just don't feel guilty for it. Emotionally healthy people don't drown in whether their actions are moral or not. They are able to think through their actions and move on.  It's rough to realize, but no one has to take responsibility for helping us get through our problems. We can certainly tell others when they hurt us, and should .... but we have to take responsibility to leave or ignore that person when they don't change (my ex).  We have to first care about taking care of ourselves. That allowing ourselves to not feel ashamed to take the time we need. It means dismissing the thought that we are lazy, and promising ourselves that we are doing our best. It means learning the tools that we need so we don't have to judge ourselves based on what we think other people will think. And it means finding a community of people with whom we can exchange support.  At least that's what I'm trying to realize."

Look so much of the population thinks that sending men to war is fine and dandy. People are not built for you to send them to war, or put through domestic violence or rape or child abuse situations.

What I took it to mean is that we can only percieve life thorough our own experiences. This extends to people (and there are a lot in this age) who haven't had serious shock trauma. They simply haven't been through what you've been through and can't concieve of what effect that trauma would have. The answer (in a perfect world) is having an emphatic response but your average person hasn't had many experiences to practice this in. Instead they feel uncomfortable when confronted by an experience that they can't have empathy for of are worried that they can't have empathy for. They probably do have an empathic response but it confronts a feeling of vulnerability within themselves that they can't handle.   You know what you are going through and the victories. You need to celebrate those. You may need to explain this from a million ways for your friends to understand or let it go and look to youself for acknowledgment.   Speaking from the heart is a wonderful skill to have. There are people who can handle and there are people who can't.

ptsd,394rsb,-gogo-,2,Tue Jun 9 12:06:05 2015 UTC,"A few things, in patient care is available, but it requires that your dad be an immediate threat to himself or someone else and it is virtually the same as being locked up under other circumstances, at least to most veterans who value their personal freedom to floss their teeth, clip their nails, or simply take a shower without begging and waiting for someone else's timeline. The resources available for PTSD through the VA have nothing to do with putting anyone in prison, I'm not sure where that fear is coming from. If that's something your dad has been telling you he either misunderstands or is full of it. Anything your dad tells those doctors or counselors remains confidential unless he's threatening harm to himself or someone else, or speaking of current abuse of a child or elderly person.   The important thing to understand here is that the only person you have control over is yourself. If your dad is going to get help, he has to want it and actively participate in the process of recovering. The drugs aren't magic, and they don't ""fix"" PTSD, they just make the symptoms somewhat easier to deal with when the right drugs are found, which varies from person to person. Some of them are even harmful to the recovery process once the person has made a commitment to doing more than ignoring their trauma, at least according to my current VA psychiatrist. Your parents are adults whether or not they act like it, and unless they want to go through the process of helping themselves and their relationship, there's nothing you can do.  Many of the people my husband and I have met in the trauma recovery services groups at our VA are only there because of an ultimatum from their family, and most of them are a lot older than your dad, although a fair amount may be his age and younger. This may reassure him, my husband was really worried about judgement from older veterans before he started. It's also important to understand that if he really does make an effort to seek treatment, things will likely get worse before they get better. An anger management class may be helpful before cognitive processing therapy or similar treatment is begun. The orientation for trauma recovery services is available for family members in my area, and may be helpful for both you and your mother in terms of understanding what you're seeing go on with him. Another  great place to start is ""The Warriors Guide to Insanity"" by Sgt Andy which is the hardest book I've ever read, emotionally speaking, but also the best at explaining the feelings a veteran with PTSD deals with.

I also regularly get incredibly frustrated that I can't watch a movie, a TV show, or read a book without worrying about whether or not something is going to trigger a panic attack or a flashback. I've gotten better with TV shows, I think because they are shorter. And books I can mostly handle, I think because it's easy to just put down and walk away. But I don't really watch movies at all.

I have CPTSD and I have had very few ""stand out"" situations, rather than just a chronic - neglectful upbringing.  It's interesting, because when talking with people, on one hand - most don't think I had it so bad.  I even have cousins that are still actively denying that ""your parent's drinking wasn't that big of a deal"", who never lived in my house - just because they can't believe it for themselves.  Then I have lost quite a few friends, because when I do start to share, they feel overwhelmed, and slowly stop talking to me because they cannot relate - and just can't hang for all the neglect that I have in my past.  I wish you well, and just wanted to share that I very much relate.  I now have quite a few friends that relate - and then even they get maxed out at times, but at least we all can talk about it.  12 step groups really helped me, but more along the lines of CoDA and ACoA... because those are places people go to talk about family stuff.

Since it's not in the DSM-5 it's not technically a diagnosis. But it basically means that there wasn't one specific single event that caused it.   For me it was growing up with an obsessively controlling mother and an alcoholic father. Lots of verbal and emotional abuse with the occasional act of physical abuse thrown in for good measure. Top that off with trying to explain this to family and friends and being told to 'deal with it' (basically being abandoned) and you get PTSD.  It all confused the daylights out of me for awhile. This description helped: https://outofthefog.net/CommonNonBehaviors/CPTSD.html

ptsd,392z8x,boomboommusica,3,Wed Jun 10 05:54:26 2015 UTC,"I know what you mean... and yeah that kind of just makes the whole thing more confusing.   Mine wasn't just a specific event, although the specific event did set the PTSD ball rolling. It was also years of not being safe in my own home... of not being protected by my parents."

""‘a stressful event or situation... of an exceptionally threatening or catastrophic nature, which is likely to cause pervasive distress in almost anyone"" NIH     I'd say you had a situation that would have caused pervasive distress in anyone.     and, in my case - there were 2 or 3 ""big"", stereotypical violent &  expected traumas I was able to work through;  it was the constant barrage of crap that broke (?) me to where I couldn't function right anymore.   Trying to rebuild ""me"" - I have to deal with each individual trauma and work through , at least so far."
ptsd,392z8x,rewardiflost,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:07:31 2015 UTC,"I've had multiple traumas over my lifetime, but I first received a diagnosis because of severe childhood physical and sexual abuse that occurred over years.

If I were you, I would just clearly tell him where your boundaries are and tell him not to cross them. Then, if he ever crosses a boundary, you should break up with him.  Also, have you talked to your therapist about this? Your therapist might be able to give you even better advice than I can."

ptsd,391b7p,Jan291,3,Mon Jun 8 17:51:39 2015 UTC,"It sounds to me like you feel ashamed and feel like there is something intrinsic wrong with you that will mean that you will always tend to get abused or will not be able to protect yourself from picking an abusive partner or be able to ""see the red flags"" in a potentially abusive partner. You seem to be feeling defective in a way. I don't think you are defective or that you have anything to feel ashamed of but many survivors of abuse do feel similar to you, like it's something wrong with them or their sense of things that caused them to get abused and could cause it again. I could be wrong I don't know if that is accurate ? If it is all I can say to you is be proud of who you are and your strength and even if you have battlescars emotionally from prior abuse that make you feel you might get abused again be proud of yourself and your scars, your scars show your strength you you got through and survived something that no human was meant to go through."
ptsd,391b7p,genericgermanium,2,Tue Jun 9 21:55:03 2015 UTC,"That was very kind of you to say. I do think because of my trauma I am overly defensive, but it is also a statistical fact. I appreciate you validating my (unhealthy) self-doubt though, thank you. <3"
ptsd,391b7p,Jan291,2,Wed Jun 10 15:39:19 2015 UTC,"I don't know if this will help your particular situation. This may sound a little silly, but I think it's important to trust your gut in a situation like this. Do you generally feel safe around this guy? If you don't, you may end up pushing yourself into an uncomfortable and/or triggering situation. Generally I don't really feel safe around men, but there have been a few exceptions. I know personally that makes a worlds of difference for myself. Another important thing to talk to your partner about is letting you initiate physical contact and decide where things go."
ptsd,391b7p,resealableplasticbag,2,Mon Jun 8 19:28:37 2015 UTC,"I felt safe until I heard about this, which triggered me, and it's difficult to separate if I'm scared because of my past or if my instincts are bothering me. Thank you very much for your input."
ptsd,39026w,FordSupreme,3,Mon Jun 8 07:02:49 2015 UTC,"I have a lot of issues with consent confusion after I had a one night stand. She told me afterwards that it was mostly automatic responses, a drunken mistake and that she wasn't really into me. I completely understood, but that didn't stop my best friend from saying I sexually assaulted our friend.  I guess though it's a similar problem from a man's perspective: Am I making her feel uncomfortable? Does she think I'm just after sex? Is she actually into me? Being a victim of abuse the accusations that were made by my best friend made me feel like I'd become my own worst enemy. I want to have a normal sex life as well, and I want to avoid hurting people the way you've been. At the moment I'm that scared of hurting people in order to avoid it I keep people at a distance, and it's so lonely."
ptsd,39026w,FarKingCnut,2,Mon Jun 8 09:01:46 2015 UTC,"Thank you for sharing that, it's interesting to see it from the other side of the coin. I can easily relate to your last statement though, but more so with hurting myself than with others. I do hope you overcome this fear, you seem like a caring person and shouldn't need to fear that."
ptsd,39026w,genericgermanium,5,Mon Jun 8 17:19:27 2015 UTC,"(TW: potential sexual assault, idk what I'm doing here) I can relate a little OP. I know I have a huge problem telling men no.  I feel as if I need to please them even if I don't enjoy it myself. Part of this for me comes from past trauma and growing up in an sexually abusive household. Some of it is also due to my general upbringing and due to social pressures. I know a lot of people have similar issues. For a long time I thought I simply didn't enjoy sex, until I met someone I was actually into and made me feel safe. But then it all went to shit a few weeks ago  when I got into a weird situation with a guy I considered a friend at that point. I was very drunk and feeling vulnerable. I froze and then felt like I had to put up with it/try to enjoy it. Though I did snap out of it and push him off eventually, I did develop some new triggers and issues concerning this. Part of me feels like he took advantage of me, while another part of me feels guilty because I didn't tell him no explicitly right away and I tried to put up with it. I'm really hoping EMDR can help me work through some of these triggers. I hope you can find something to help you too."
ptsd,39026w,resealableplasticbag,4,Mon Jun 8 13:37:11 2015 UTC,"I, too, have had a similar experience, and it was with my soon-to-be husband.  Basically, he said something to trigger me, proceeded to have rough sex with me (which is not uncommon for us), all the while I am paralyzed by fear and loathing and am internally screaming for him to stop, but am unable to verbalize this. In short, I felt like I was being raped, but I never expressed nonconsent. My husband never intended to violate me in such a way, and yet that's precisely how I felt -- like I had been violated, stripped of my power and my bodily autonomy, and left desolate.  I love my husband very much, and he me. If I would have said stop (or our safeword), he would have, but I did not. I physically could not. I don't want to call what happened to me rape, and yet I don't have another word for what the experience felt like.  In short, I don't have any answers for you OP, but I can't tell you that you're not alone."
ptsd,39026w,Wattsherfayce,3,Mon Jun 8 16:30:19 2015 UTC,"Thank you for sharing that with me, and I'm glad that I'm not alone in this feeling. For so long it felt like I was the only one who confused consent like that."

I hope you find the right therapist, I just started seeing one and it's only been 2 sessions but I really hope it does something for me that I can't do for myself. Mine is specialized in trauma and he is real big on something called EMDR, it requires a therapist to do, but it is kind of like hypnotism and if you want you can ask your next therapist about it and try it out. Also, this is random, but I read on reddit 2 years ago that Tetris helps with PTSD and I have no idea why but I started playing Tetris ever since I read that 2 years ago, anyway, if you're looking for a game..."

That's great that you are trying to get help! You don't have to go through this alone.   Have you tried asking your doctor if there are any therapists that your insurance covers or maybe even free programs or group therapy?    For nightmares.... I take Prazosin, it has worked really well for me....my dreams are vivid but not scary/violent. I still have insomnia though..I get scared at night and too afraid to sleep...I'm thinking about trying melatonin."
ptsd,38zmw8,Sun_will_rise_again,1 point,Mon Jun 8 05:28:00 2015 UTC,"Hi, I'm GoGo. I'm so glad you've started to be proactive in your recovery. That's so empowering in and of itself.  Let's talk meds, because it's the best way to start healing your brain. I take Prazosin (Minipress) for my nightmares and it does help. An antidepressant will help too. I'd also ask your General Practitioner for something to help your anxiety during those stressful times that usually cause the flashbacks, like the Fourth of July. And to help out until your other meds kick in, those take time to reach their full potential.  You are your best advocate. ""the squeaky wheel gets the grease"" is certainly true, no one will help if you don't ask or demand it. So just keep asking until someone listens and don't get discouraged.  This part is hard, but stress exacerbates our symptoms and can lead to an acute episode because of the adrenaline dump. It really helps to try to find ways to keep your stress levels down. Is there a back road you could take into the city that doesn't have as much traffic? It may take way longer, but will be worth it in the long run. It helps me and I like to look at the pretty scenery and sing along terribly to the radio. ;-)"

I was never in combat, but I've been the victim of domestic violence several times. So, I can relate a little to what you're going through.  For me, one thing that really helps is having friends who have gone through domestic violence also. I have four friends who have gone through domestic violence, and talking to them helps me feel a lot better. Talking to them is almost like group therapy. Just having a friend who can relate to the shit that I've gone through helps me feel better.  Anyways, I encourage you to find some friends that you can talk to. Maybe you are still in touch with some guys from the military? Or, maybe you can make some new friends at the VA?  I'm not a therapist, but if you ever want to just talk to someone who can relate to you, you can send me a private message anytime. I'm a good listener."

Also with relationships and sleep disruptions and people airing your business online.  Thanks for being so brave with your stuff. I don't know how or why exactly but just reading it makes me feel a little less...alone? It's a big deal. I could never even begin to elaborate on my ""story"". Emotional vulnerability=weakness=pain the way my head works so I always feel ashamed even when I know there's no reason to be.  Fuck I dunno what that even means. Regardless, thanks.

ptsd,38y1es,wallyflies,2,Sun Jun 7 20:32:01 2015 UTC,"All too familiar -- seeing just that snippet of one day written out reminds me why I feel so exhausted all the time. Having to be on guard every moment of every day is so draining.   Humans have gotten good at not only predicting when danger will occur (through conditioning, modeling, and other ways of learning) but also devising ways to avoid and protect against these dangers. I'd guess most people on average are pretty good at doing this -- not perfect, but for the most part can accurately categorize threats from non-threats without too many false positives and false negatives.  I feel like our brains' response to intense trauma(s) is to start altering that threat categorization. Like the brain realizes that because a trauma was experienced, it's gotta be more selective when filing situations into the ""non-threat"" category, to feel safer. More things are deemed ""dangerous"" and while that probably means more ""false positives"" (labeling situations as threats that are benign), it's better to be safe than sorry.   But life continues and shit happens, and whenever the traumatized brain notices that a threat got through the filter, it responds being more and more selective about what is deemed not dangerous.  At some point nearly everything we experience, once filtered through the traumatized brain, is potential danger. The smallest things can evoke fear - a sound, an expression on the face of a stranger, something moving too fast, things seeming too still -- nothing feels safe.   Sometimes I wonder though, if my brain is being so careful to keep away from danger, why do I still feel so afraid? That maybe focusing so hard on making sure I'm safe actually just makes me never feel safe. And that maybe being a little less self-protective would allow some moments of feeling at ease."

ptsd,38y1es,FarKingCnut,1 point,Mon Jun 8 03:42:43 2015 UTC,It's different for everyone. For me it's a constant numbness and some dissociation while feeling inadequate and thinking about how annoying it is to deal with everything and everyone.
ptsd,38y1es,CynicTheLion,1 point,Mon Jun 8 08:44:42 2015 UTC,"Sounds like what my girlfriend goes through everyday. She said she hates arguments and negativity. She occasionally tells me that she wants to break up and that she is done with people and hates America because she used to live in Japan and treat Japan as the best place to live in the world. Then goes on a rampage of talking bad about why human society sucks and how disgusting the world is.      When it comes to little things like getting a door to open with a key and she is having trouble. She gets super frustrated and begins to physically bang on the door out of irrational behavior and frustration when clearly it's not going to open it unless it is unlocked by a key. Little things like that get her frustrated. Her sister has confirmed with me that she has PTSD but if I mentioned it to her, she will most likely be in self denial. Ah the struggles.."

ptsd,38xz57,Horselain_Porcelain,2,Sun Jun 7 20:14:51 2015 UTC,Isn't it the generally accepted theory that even if the memories are dampened then the behavioural affect will still happen but the brain will come up with its own justification? I've heard that in relation to hypnotism to remove unwanted memories.   I've read that psychologists found that talking through what happened and different reactions that someone who's experienced trauma could have done as soon as possible following a traumatic event is very effective (from soldiers in Afghanistan). Do you think medication and this therapy could be useful?
ptsd,38xz57,klutzikaze,1 point,Sun Jun 7 21:07:04 2015 UTC,"I think your right about the theory but I'm not totally sure. I have read a lot of different journals and I've seen a lot of different ideas. But yes, I absolutely think this should be used with therapy, I think it would be a bad idea not too. Almost positive therapy is always followed up with someone who has taken the meds."
ptsd,38xz57,Jan291,1 point,Sun Jun 7 21:19:44 2015 UTC,Yes actually apparently part of the issue with PTSD is not being able to remember the trauma fully in narrative form.

ptsd,38xz57,abradolph,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:45:02 2015 UTC,"Not ""delete"" from what I've read. If someone were to witness an event that could give them PTSD, they could take the drugs within 6hours of the event, and it'll stop adrenaline and all the other chemicals that go to your hippocampus which will make the memory less vivid, or dampened, so the memory will not be as intense. If I understand correctly, it just does not make the memory as intense, you still remember it.   I do not have PTSD so I'm not sure how the symptoms are, but this seems like it could really help people who suffer."

I went to the police almost two years ago (July 2013) against my abusive ex and his friend.  They were both arrested and I got a restraining order against my ex.  They stole a LOT of money from my account by going to different ATMs.   My ex was violent and abusive in every way...I was only 14 when I met him, he was 30...he's a monster.  The friend's case was unfortunately recently dismissed without prejudice even though he's in all the surveillance pics.... but it can still be reopened.  Going through the ""justice"" system is very scary....you'll have to relive what happened over and over in front of strangers.  Its also a VERY sloooow, confusing, frustrating and stressful process...at least for me it has been.  If you really want to do it, I think you should!  Even if nothing comes of it at least what he did will be on record with the police in case more of his victims come forward.  Do you have a restraining order against him?"

You can just go to the local court (it has to be in the same state as the defendant) and fill out the paper work to request a RO.  Then you go in front of a judge and explain why you are afraid of him and the abuse you've been through.  The judge will then decide whether or not to grant a temporary (usually 2 weeks) RO until the defendant is served.  Once he is served, you show up again on the date that on the temporary RO to renew it for a year (or how ever long the judge decides)....he may or may not (he doesn't HAVE to) show up to contest it.   The court victim/witness advocates can help you through the process if you have any questions, they also usually stand next to you in front of the judge so you're not alone."

ptsd,38untc,Sun_will_rise_again,2,Sun Jun 7 05:36:50 2015 UTC,One usually gets assigned to your case right at the court.   But you can also get in touch with places that help victims of rape/domestic violence... They usually have advocates that you can sit down with and really tell them everything that happened and they will usually meet you there in court if you want them to.  The court advocate that's assigned to me is very nice but she's also very busy (it is a pretty busy court)  She didn't bother telling me about the pretrial for the friend... I only found out just days before because I called her. There were a few times she was supposed to call me back or set up a meeting w/the prosecutor and she didn't.
ptsd,38untc,drfitcat,2,Sun Jun 7 06:12:52 2015 UTC,Ugh...what the hell that's awful.  Do you think you can get reassigned to a different person?? Or that you can maybe go to an outside advocate source? (if you haven't already) I hope things work out for you.

They can  help/support you through the restraining order process,  and point you to places were you might find more legal help.    The court advocates work  within the court...they have access to your case files and they are sort of a bridge between you and the prosecutors and police.     Unfortunately... With courts being as busy as they are, its easy for them to forget about you.  Its frustrating.  I am a quiet, soft spoken person...and I have PTSD, its been hard to be proactive when dealing w/ the court...you really have to be your own advocate.   So please, if your case does turn to into a criminal case, don't be afraid to speak up for yourself... Ask them  lots of questions...if they don't call you back when they are supposed to, call THEM.

ptsd,38untc,reasonweb,1 point,Sun Jun 7 05:28:19 2015 UTC,"Late to the party, but just saw this. I just wanted to say that if you feel like it's necessary to go through the courts for the sake of your cousins, then absolutely go for it. When those things work out right, it's amazing. Even if it fails, it will do your cousins a world of good to know that someone was looking out for them. Even if they don't know about it, or realize what your doing for them now, it will help them down the road to be able to tell themselves that someone out there cared.   We're getting ready for a bit of a thing with the courts right now that I can't go into any details on at the moment. And I'm only tangentially related. The thought of having to go into courtrooms and talk to judges and make my case causes consistent panic attacks. But I'll be damned if I let this disease stop me from helping someone else who desperately needs it.   I think you're awesome for even contemplating it. If you do go for it, you'll be double awesome. Hang in there. PM me if you're ever in need of an understanding voice."

ptsd,38pg9s,Acrophobe,11,Fri Jun 5 19:05:59 2015 UTC,"It's not a matter of forgiveness, it's a matter of flashbacks, nightmares, feeling trapped, worthless and horrible every time I see/hear/talk to them or about them.    It's so hard when people think that I'm weak, over dramatic, petty, and so on when I'm having an episode or just a bad day. That I ""let"" things effect me. That it's a conscious decision that I make.   I do my best to treat the people around me with respect and to not be a humongous burden. But sometimes, it can't be helped. It's a physical reaction to something, like having a seizure or an asthma attack. Too bad there's not an inhaler for PTSD.  I'm really sorry your future MIL doesn't get it. Hopefully, you won't have to interact with her insensitive crap too often!"
ptsd,38pg9s,mmcrowle,3,Fri Jun 5 19:14:08 2015 UTC,"I realize she can't understand, because she had a better family, she had brothers and sisters she loved. Her mom wasn't the best but she still loved and cared for her, she thinks it's just a matter of forgiveness, but her mom didn't make her suicidal and her family didn't make her life a living hell. She had good times when she was a kid, I didn't. I realize it's a matter of ignorance, but it hurts. It hurts that even when I try to explain it she doesn't get it. I want her to get it since we're gonna be family and it'd be great to have a loving and supportive mother in law. But you can't make someone understand, I guess it's just one of those things.   I wish there was an inhaler for PTSD too, all I can do is take a clonazepam when I'm starting to panic and just try to remain in the now. I wish it was a conscious decision, I wish I was just being petty or over dramatic. Because that'd mean I was being selfish and treating myself better, it's hard to love yourself when you've been taught not to.   It's rough, but it's nice when someone understands, because it's hard when no one understands. I just wish people could understand without also being a victim. :("
ptsd,38pg9s,mmcrowle,4,Fri Jun 5 19:32:02 2015 UTC,"Yep. Having somebody understand is great, but it also means they've lived through something awful.

ptsd,38pg9s,FarKingCnut,5,Fri Jun 5 22:49:03 2015 UTC,"Spot on, OP.  I get the impression your MIL has a very misguided idea of what it means to forgive someone. Forgiving is not the same as forgetting. Forgiving someone doesn't mean that you pretend the abuse didn't happen, or allow them to continue abusing you. It doesn't require you to have that person in your life whatsoever. It just means that you let go of the hurt, anger, resentment, etc. as much as you can. Sometimes it's an ongoing process, and even when you think you're done, another aspect pops up and needs to be dealt with too.   Forgiveness has been the key to freedom from my past, but it wasn't my abusers that I needed to forgive in order for that to happen; it was me."

ptsd,38pg9s,Jan291,3,Sat Jun 6 02:14:29 2015 UTC,"Yes and just like touching a hot stove, ""forgiving"" the stove and not hating it won't get rid of the scars.   I plan to forgive no one that has hurt me. I don't know if I will succeed with my plans, maybe people will succeed in crushing me down and making me just submit and give up and blame myself but I plan to hold everyone accountable for their actions.

You know what is best for you deep down inside, whether it's cutting ties or trying to work through it. But after so long you'll have to do what's best for you, even though it's hard. I knew for the longest time that my relationship with my parents was unhealthy and they weren't willing to change, it's taken me years to act on it. It takes time to admit that a relationship isn't salvageable, my parents would always fake apologize but not five minutes later be abusing again. It might be time to admit your girlfriend isn't worth the pain especially if you describe the relationship as extremely unhealthy.

ptsd,38pg9s,Blu_wolf,0,Sat Jun 6 23:06:10 2015 UTC,"Just a suggestion in case you haven't, have you ever checked out the /r/raisedbynarcissists sub that's in the sidebar here? They've all been through these kinds of things, and it's nice to have a place where people are supportive and understanding in regard to these horrible kind of things.   ""Normal"" people often aren't very good at handling these conversations and situations. Sometimes they mean well but say the wrong thing, and other times they decide you're the problem because they don't want to think of the possibility of someone going through so much pain and difficulty while having done absolutely nothing to deserve it. For those people it's easier for them to blame you than it is to blame your abusers.  None of this was your fault or your doing. And I'd say you're like most people in that you don't want to have to do things like cut them out of your life. If only others could seem to realize that most people don't do that kind of thing without a pretty damn good reason.  You sound like you're on your way to making it out of the constant turmoil they brought to your life. And I fully support you and anyone else doing whatever is necessary to make sure those who have hurt you in the past and/or continue to do so don't drag you back down with them.  Forgiveness shouldn't be for anyone other than yourself. You forgive when it's what you want to do, and when you feel it makes things better for you, and not for the person who wronged you. People who insist otherwise are just perpetuating an environment where the victim is intended to carry all of the guilt and responsibility, while the abuser feels free to continue behaving as horribly as they were before. And that's a pretty fucked up way to handle the kind of experience people on this sub and RBN have had to deal with in their lives.  You definitely deserve freedom from your past, and everything else that comes with living a life the way you want to for yourself. Short of hurting others, no one should really have that much say in what makes you feel most happy, comfortable, and free."

Lots of us with CPTSD were misdiagnosed with Bipolar Disorder first. CPTSD is worsened by periods of prolonged stress. Bipolar Disorder is too, but the symptoms are more, umm... constant.

Then, because of my impulse control issues, before I know it I've had three or four ""hairs of the dog"". Someone turned me on to this delicious Tito's Texas Corn Vodka and it might be my undoing.

Now, of course that depends on the circumstance. When I am drinking with my best friend, it is completely different, but I don't get to do that with him very much. Most of my drinking is alone in a dark, empty, cold apartment where I don't feel safe and my head gets going and because I am a fun drunk too and have no one to share that with, it just tears me down. :-/  It hurts me to think about for a lot of reasons. A lot because my personality used to be so different. And I love beer almost as a hobby and used to enjoy finding rare beer and tasting different ones. Also, because at one point I did consider drinking a coping mechanism and those are shrinking for me instead of growing. And the feeling of hopelessness is so intense right now.   Thank you for posting this and admitting it ""out loud"". The comments here just prove that there are non-judmental people that get it and although we are not bonded cause PTSD doesn't let us do that and we are not ""not alone"" because again PTSD won't allow that, we at least can identify and validate and do the best we can here.

Drinking is about the worst kind of drug someone with PTSD can do, aside from, like, psychedelics (without clinical monitoring).   Just know that there is no bottom.

ptsd,38mpru,OhHey_BigZam,1 point,Fri Jun 5 05:22:52 2015 UTC,"Well, recurring nightmares are definitely a common symptom for PTSD, but far from the only symptom. If nightmares and anxiety about a certain thing are the only problems you have this could just as easily be something else, like a phobia.  This link has a list of all the symptoms for PTSD in really easy to understand language rather than medical jargon, so it might help you sort out some of your confusion to go through the list and compare it to your own experiences. If you're meeting a lot of those criteria, chances are pretty good you have PTSD. However, the best way to know for sure is to see a therapist and talk about what's going on so they can properly diagnose you."

ptsd,38dxd6,mmcrowle,9,Wed Jun 3 16:12:17 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry that happened to you. I understand where you're coming from because I have been there myself over the past year. I was sexually abused as a child at the hands of my pedophile mother who sold me to other men when she was not making me perform for her own amusement. Like you, I chose to bury it in a box and focus on my schooling and career only to have it pop back up in a big way with a job change. It was then that I was diagnosed with C-PTSD. I lost the job and have had to crawl my way through it for over a year now.  Here's what my fiancé and I have learned through the process.  You are a very courageous warrior even though you won't feel like it most days. It takes a lot of strength and courage to face what you're facing and not give up. Continuing to seek help through therapy will be vitally important. Try to find someone who does EMDR or who is willing to be trained in EMDR as that will help get you over a lot of your triggers.   You have a lot to work through and you need to be kind to yourself and forgive yourself. What happened was not your fault and you are not going to function at 100 percent for a while as you move through the recovery process. It's okay to mourn and grieve for what was stolen from you, it's okay to be angry, and it's okay to feel whatever you're feeling. Allow yourself the time and opportunity to get through this and quit beating yourself up every time you have a trigger because there are going to be a lot more to come.  You need to learn what your limitations are and communicate them with your significant other when you can. My fiancé had to change some things about the way he would walk through the door after work because they were very triggering for me. Likewise I would be able to tell him that I feel particularly triggered today and this is what I need to feel close or have intimacy with you. You don't have to do anything you don't want to do and if that means taking a break from sex that's okay. You need to do what's best for your healing process.   Throughout all of this you both need support. You need to have family, friends, or a support group that you can count on because your significant other is not going to be able to be there for you 24/7 because he needs to take care of himself emotionally too. You can contact the sexual abuse hotline 24/7 365 days a year at 1-800-656-HOPE and they have trained professionals that will talk to you or help you find a support group. Sometimes it's beneficial to be around those who understand and you don't have to explain it to because unless you've been there it's incredibly difficult to express what it feels like on your worst of worst days. The website www.rainn.org has a 24/7 chat line where you can talk to a trained professional by text. It also has a lot of good information for those in a supportive role. I would suggest sitting down together with your man and calling the hotline or going to the website so that you can both hear the same information on how he can be a better support to you.   Remember that your significant other has needs too and that you need to keep the lines of communication open so that he feels included in your world too. Sometimes he is going to have to take care of his own needs whether that be leaning on someone else for emotional support because you can't be there for him right now because you're focusing on you or whether that's his sexual needs. You do what you feel comfortable in doing because you have control now but recognize that he needs to lean on his support system as much as you need to lean on yours. It's healthy for you to have your alone time to heal and it's healthy for him to have some alone time so he can be a better support to you. He's going to be very emotionally drained and it does you no good if he's grumpy with you and at you because he misses you. What happened to you was not your fault, but how you both choose to deal with it can impact the relationship moving forward. Check in with him and see what his needs are and what you can and can not accommodate. Encourage him to go out and have fun and be around friends and family so that he can be emotionally there for you.  I suggest getting the book The Courage To Heal by Laura Davis and Ellen Bass. It's all about survivors of childhood sexual abuse and what they go through as they move through the healing process. It gives practical advice for moving forward as is good information for anyone in a supportive role. I not only learned a lot about myself but I also learned how to cope better.  I was also able to reference the book on several occasions to my fiancé so that he better understood what I was going through. It made him more empathetic and understanding.  It does get better. You will see a lot of progress for a while and it will seem like it suddenly tapers off. You will feel at that point like you're backsliding because you will have two or three really good days and then be blindsided by a few bad days. When this happens I've noticed that for most survivors it took more stress, more triggers, or more neglecting of their own emotional needs to bring on the bad days. That's progress from where you are from right now. Eventually those days of progress will turn into a week or more with a bad day every once in a while. Eventually you will get to a few weeks. When you have a bad day just focus on processing what happened and reflecting about your progress and possible triggers. Bring that into therapy so you can get better."
ptsd,38dxd6,Drabbeynormalblues,5,Wed Jun 3 16:56:06 2015 UTC,"Thank you so, so much for taking the time to write all that out. It's good to know that I'm not the only one struggling with this because I feel so isolated sometimes. I appreciate the book recommendation...I haven't read that one yet, and one of my coping strategies has generally been to devour as much information about a problem as I can.   How did you and your SO navigate the issue of intimacy? That's one subject I'm so nervous to deal with. I don't want to be a bad partner.  I'm scared for this process, but I know I can do it. Thanks again for all of the advice, I really appreciate the support."
ptsd,38dxd6,Drabbeynormalblues,2,Wed Jun 3 17:13:28 2015 UTC,"In terms of intimacy in the beginning I had a lot of triggers. Instinctually my man would stop, be loving and tender, hold me, be concerned, and ask what I needed. Since what happened to me started when I was in diapers sometimes I needed creature comforts from that time. Sometimes I wanted the feeling of sucking on a bottle so I found a water bottle that fit that need and used that. Sometimes I just wanted to held or cuddled. Other times I wanted to be read to. Being with someone who understands that you need to take care of your inner child and heal that inner child is going to be important. Sometimes we would have to stop during sex and take care of those needs and other times we were able to work through it and continue.   You need to work out what works best for you and your relationship. Sometimes I would have a trigger and it would send me on an emotional loop for the entire week. Other times I'd be okay with it. Sometimes what I was experiencing was so emotionally overwhelming that I was unable to form the words to communicate what was happening. We developed a hand signal system for those moments so that I got what I needed from him while still allowing me the physical and emotional ability to experience and process what I needed to moving forward. In the beginning it was kinda rough as we were learning this because he felt I was withholding information when in reality I just couldn't verbalize things. Always try to include your significant other when you are able to so that they know what's going on, how to help, and that it's not them. If you look at it from your significant other's perspective you were once totally warm and inviting and now you're freaking out during sex. My fiancé has told me that sometimes my flashbacks and triggers make him feel like a rapist because of the way I react during sex. Remind him that this is the result of what others have done to you and it's something you need to work through and not any way, shape, or form something that he has done although something he has done may have caused the trigger. For me in the beginning just the fact that my fiancé was male and existed was a trigger. Lots and lots and lots of patience, communication, and trial and error got us through this. Remember that this is an adjustment period for him and he needs time to adjust to the new relationship. Be sure to check with him often and see what his needs are. He is going to miss you and the way things were and he is going to have moments where he is frustrated, sad, hurt, or grumpy. In a way he is grieving for what was lost and that's perfectly healthy and okay. You are not responsible for his feelings but you are responsible for caring about them. He needs love, acceptance, and support just as much as you do.   You are going to need a lot of control during sex sometimes absurdly so. Sometimes depending on the day I can't have my significant other make sudden movements during sex even a year later. Sexual healing is the hardest part to the healing process and takes a lot of time. You are not broken or defective and you will get through this. There's a great book called The Body Keeps The Score by Bessel Van Der Kolk which is currently the world's leading expert in dealing with trauma and PTSD that you should also check out. Sometimes things happen to us at such a young age that we don't have the words to process or describe what happened so our body holds the trauma and comes out in ways like certain sexual triggers. This gives the biology of what happens as well as gives advice on how to overcome it.  As far as everything else goes, take it on a day by day basis. There are going to be days where you will have intimacy with no problems whatsoever. There are also going to be days when you have multiple triggers. Some people refuse to have intimacy if they've had a trigger and that's okay. I choose to take a time out and work through the trigger with my fiancé and then try to be intimate again. I stop if I recognize that I'm not able to connect for example I'm staring at the wall, zoning out, thinking about groceries, or finding his touch disgusting because I'm not really feeling him but what these other people did to me. There's not a right or wrong way to do this, but if you force yourself to do things you're really not interested in or capable of what you're really doing is retraumatizing yourself and making it more difficult for you to heal. Take it at your own pace and communicate what your needs are.  Some people find it helpful to abstain from sex altogether for a while - weeks, months, years. Some people find it helpful just to focus on masturbation alone whereas others want to abstain from that too because it's too triggering. Healing happens on your terms and it's not something you can force. You have to do what's best for your emotional and mental well being and if that means your partner has to get used to being alone sexually then you will get back to a place where you're comfortable with it. The idea is that you let the baggage go so you can fully enjoy it the way it was meant to be and not how the abuse makes you feel. Don't beat yourself up for focusing on your recovery. You wouldn't tell a cancer patient on their death bed that they're being unfair to their partner because they're too sick from the chemo and radiation to have sex and that they're being selfish. Just because you have something going on that is mental in nature doesn't make it any different. Forgive yourself for not being the partner you once were. You'll get back there but you need to get better first."

ptsd,38dxd6,Jan291,4,Thu Jun 4 18:59:47 2015 UTC,"I understand how conflicted you're feeling right now, it's like a secondary trauma because your feelings aren't being validated the way they should be - by someone who is meant to care about you. I also understand that this is a tough situation for him to deal with too, because I've been both parties at one stage or the other. I've been in your shoes, and his. However, with all of that in mind, I still think that his reaction to your need for some help was downright disgusting. I know you might not welcome hearing this, but you need to think about whether or not you really want to be with someone like that. Not every guy will walk away just because they get 'scared' that they can't help you. I mean, this guy basically called you self centered for having an emotional breakdown after your therapy appointment - and then left to play video games. Who do you think was being self centered in that scenario? It wasn't you, that's for sure. I'm sorry if I'm being a bit blunt here, but I can't stand to think of anyone being treated that way. You're worth so much more and you deserve so much more. You deserve to be treated with love and kindness by the person you're in love with and who supposedly loves you."
ptsd,38dxd6,Carpe_Noche,3,Thu Jun 4 17:14:59 2015 UTC,I agree he sort of shamed OP and I think that that's why OP dissociated. That sort of response or fear of that sort of response is not going to help OP process her trauma. Now every time she goes to a therapy appointment she might fear that if too many things come up and she goes home in a similar situation feeling her emotions she will be shamed for it by told that she is being selfish.

Or how upset to be about different things.   I feel guilty because this has started to overtake a lot of my thoughts and I talk about it often. This is the first time in my life I've been stable and safe enough to explore these issues and begin healing. I was silent for close to twenty years...it feels like such a relief to have the freedom to speak about it at will.  I don't blame him for being upset. This is a lot to ask of anybody. It just seems like I'm such an inconvenience or a burden when I'm having a bad day and need some extra attention.   I just don't know how to balance my needs and his needs. I don't know what's healthy. I love him and I want him to be happy...but I deserve to be happy too. And I can't really be happy until I put in the hard work in treatment to get better.

While you are in recovery (much like a person who is recovering from being hit by a car physically) your needs may not be immediately balanced in an equal way this month or this year. It might still be balanced in the sense that a few years later you might take care of him during illness.

ptsd,38dxd6,Shanguerrilla,2,Thu Jun 4 22:30:23 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry this incident happened. You feel ashamed for simply asking for fairness and equality and your are thinking that something is wrong with your previous expectations because unfortunately whether he meant to or not he just shamed you about it. And that must be particularly heartbreaking and shaming coming from a lover/partner. They can cause us to feel shame even in the best of situations because we desperately want their acceptance and connection to them. I can't imagine how shaming it would feel to have someone you are in love with not only shame you whether intentional or not but also shame you in relation to something so painful and which you were already feeling shame about.  You are in a difficult situation, you have been through something awful and I think that shame could jeopardize your recovery or make it a lot harder.  I think in working through their feelings about trauma and processing it, it's not even the intense pain that trips people up so much as shame and feeling afraid to feel their feelings because in the back of their mind they are worried it might lead to social rejection and loss of relationships. If he or someone else is shaming you, whether intentionally or not, it's going to be hard for you to feel free to feel your feelings, because you're probably going to be afraid that truly feeling your feelings might result in you being needy and leading to his rejection."
ptsd,38gouo,-kodoku-,2,Thu Jun 4 02:20:04 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised your psychologist hasn't given you a diagnosis by now, have you been seeing them for long?   With regards to general anxiety, it's hard for anyone to tell you how to overcome it - but that's not because it's impossible, it's because each persons situation can be so different. Generally, you find the tools that are right for you, and use them to find your way. It looks like therapy is helping you, so that's good. Can you think of any other outlets that might help to occupy your mind when you're feeling anxious? Any activities you gave up that you used to enjoy? Sometimes it can be something as simple as just watching a movie, though, anything that gets you out of your head for long enough to feel in control of it again."
ptsd,38gouo,Carpe_Noche,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:06:13 2015 UTC,"I actually do have a diagnosis, but I only started recently seeing my psychologist. He told me I have Dissociative Identity Disorder. Like PTSD, it's caused by severe trauma. The only difference is that DID is something you develop when you're very young, while PTSD usually develops when you're older.   When I'm feeling anxious I usually put on my headphones and listen to music. It helps a bit. I also exercise, meditate, and do yoga to help me feel better. Yesterday I started trying hypnosis too. My psychologist does a form of hypnosis on me when I see him, and I've had some improvement in my symptoms. Yesterday I tried it on my own by listening to a hypnosis mp3 and it seems to have helped. It could of course just be a placebo effect, but I've noticed some drastic changes.   For example, today I knew my aunt was coming by. Now usually I would be freaking out and constantly thinking about it, but I didn't think about it at all. Even when my sister told me that she would be here any minute, I was only slightly anxious. Then when she got here she talked to me and I felt surprisingly calm. Usually when I talk to people (even family) I can barely speak because of how anxious I feel, but I got through it fine."

As for the dentist touching, keep your eyes open at the dentist, breath deep, relax and prepare for the touch.  For other physical contact, same thing.

So thanks again.  As for this post: I'm also easily startled by sudden loud noises and unexpected touch. I was recommended an app called Anxiety Release by Mark Grant. It uses bi-neural stimulation and I've found it to be useful after a few sessions, however if my brain does kick into a depression the effect lessens and I use it again. Only used it for a month so far and only when I'm in a low mood so I don't know yet if its a long term solution. For now though its my only answer to this problem."

Awful things happen and you start remembering later and you never sleep truly peacefully after.   It doesn't go away but it becomes manageable.

I believe I almost willed myself to not get sick because of this. Not sure that is a thing, but I wasn't sick a lot. I did have stomach aches a lot from stress, being terrified all the time, feeling in the way and unloved and unwanted and never feeling safe, but I kept it all to myself. I am also afraid because I've always been alone and there have been times that people were supposed to care about me and they made me take a cab home from the hospital or made me sit alone when I was scared or told me to find a ride, they couldn't be bothered. I have PTSD/C-PTSD and a lot of times I am a very scared little girl, so when I enter these situations it is like sending a little toddler to the hospital or doctor by themselves and although I'm in an adult body, my insides are all very scared little girl alone and afraid."

I was in the middle of a pretty hardcore dissociation because my meds were changed and maintaining control became very, very difficult.  I was outside because that's the safest feeling place for me, and this woman looked over and said Hello... I must have reacted in a way similar to someone who's HIGH as hell because the look on her face was simply, ""I want what you're having.""  Which of course, she doesn't.  Because she doesn't know what I'm ""having"".  And I have no idea how to explain it her.  I'm sorry I don't have advice.  But let me know what you do.

ptsd,385ym2,DoxasticPoo,2,Tue Jun 2 02:56:25 2015 UTC,"Since you were disassociated, were you able to judge her response to your response?  Did she laugh and play it off? Apologize profusely and offer to help you up? Roll her eyes and ask what is wrong with you?  Simply telling her, if she laughed/rolled her eyes, that you startle easy may turn it into a game of her trying to catch you off guard.  But if she is empathetic/apologizes to you, simply making it clear ""no approaching from behind"" might be enough for now.  Once you get to know your coworkers better, it can be easier to develop a protocol without having to divulge all the details of why.  Best of luck, keep me updated!"

When I was getting up I just threw a bunch of vague mumbling work-related nonsense at her and made a beeline for the bathroom. I spent like 20 minutes in there and then had to go finish up something else in another part of the building (plus I was totally hiding) so I really only saw her again when we were both getting in our cars, and she was on the phone then."

As they started to reveal some of their foibles or vulnerabilities I sympathised with my own as above. Eventually my secretary told me my anxiety seemed a bit high today so I took her in to my confidence and told her i had PTSD but not what had caused it. Her reaction was so supportive that I relaxed a little more and told my secretary's secretary...etc. Eventually most that i worked close with knew and i gained the confidence that people actually are more supportive than judgemental when they know you're having an ""off"" day.

I'm certainly grateful that I'm not stuck in that place. I think it's complex. I read the following article last week and felt that it summed things up well (particularly in light of the recent Duggar/19 Kids and Counting Tragedy):  http://www.salon.com/2015/05/28/i_couldve_been_a_duggar_wife_i_grew_up_in_the_same_church_and_the_abuse_scandal_doesnt_shock_me/  ""After I left, I found myself suddenly thrust into a world that I was totally unprepared to navigate. Like Kimmy Schmidt fleeing from her bunker into the sunlight, I suddenly found myself surrounded by people and events that I had never been prepared for. It was nothing like the comically magical larger world that Kimmy Schmidt finds herself in. There were no handsome rich men, no forgiving landlords, no fabulous roommates, and certainly no sacks of cash. I entered a world full of things that I did not understand and a world full of people whose ill intentions I could not interpret or comprehend.  The same sexual ignorance that had made my friends vulnerable while in the church haunted me after I left. The first time I had sex, I didn’t fully understand what was happening to me. When it was over, I noticed that I was bleeding, and I became convinced that God was going to kill me for my sin of causing lust in a man. I lay on the dirty floor of my cheap apartment’s bathroom begging for God’s forgiveness, begging to start over again, and begging for my family’s love, which I knew had now been forever forfeited by my sin. At that point, I had no frame of reference to understand that someone had taken sexual advantage of me, because the concept of date rape wasn’t part of ATI’s “Umbrella of Authority.”""  So there are complications to getting out and recovering from trauma.

I am bipolar and went to the latter. I'm a 25 year old guy and of the 9 people, 1 was my age but the others were grey (nothing wrong with that, they were just old) which made it a bit hard to relate but not impossible. Everyone seemed chipper and able to contribute to the conversation (we went in a circle talking about what's going on) but I exhuded a very uncomfortable silence the whole time even though I could tell how hard others were (nicely) trying to get me to talk. Then when I did blurt something out when it was my turn, I feel like everyone was unhappy with what I had to say because I said it in a very socially unacceptable way. But what can I say, I'm having mental problems and that's why I'm there in the first place.  I, too, haven't gotten professional help yet but I am ready now and think a therapist would do a lot of healing. As for the support group, this post just reminded me of them and I may give another another shot. I think you will have a good experience and you should try it out.

What symptoms besides depression, anxiety, alienation, and withdrawal are you experiencing? Nightmares? Panic attacks? Trouble with your temper?  That's awesome you're working.

I have some swiss cheese memory when the adrenaline is high and an hour after no replies I forgot until a bit ago I'd written this.   Nightmares. There is one ex-friend in particular I dream about when the in an episode. It often is the first sign, though this time she came a little late. Panic attacks too, at normal places like my gym. Hard to explain to people why you are quiet when they ask. Trouble with my temper, wow I never thought of that some how... but yeah. Usually I'm super easy going, but been snapping at people and cursing motorists out a lot more.   Working is something different indeed! If it comes time to do so for you, start slow. Three days a week is almost a bit much for me, but I'll give it another couple weeks to see before asking to cut back more.   It's hard to be kind to oneself at times - like needing to tell people I would prefer to stay in tonight instead of going an hour away to Denver for a friend's party. I know they don't mind, would want me to do what I needed to, but I spent an hour writing and deleting the text to say I wasn't going.   Thank you for being here. I do talk a lot with my therapist about the PTSD. No meds, though I've wondered if something might help when it gets really low on me. Also wondering if it's come about this time from a new supplement I was taking to help me make the sleeping shift for work. Been off it three days now and finally feeling like I'm pulling up today.   Thank you. :)"
ptsd,37vob4,-gogo-,1 point,Sun May 31 21:26:53 2015 UTC,"Hey you, I'm back. What supplement were you taking? How long have you been back to work?  I've noticed my adrenaline and acute symptoms will spike after I change my diet, or have extra stress in my life too. My memory sucks then as well, and my social anxiety. Or if my insomnia rears it's ugly head.  I think it's wise to monitor your feelings to see if you can handle three days back to work and you're keeping an eye on your symptoms. Good job. Very insightful. :-)  The stress of having to be somewhere at a certain time and expected to behave a certain way is just too much for me still. I've been out of work since 2012. I don't have control of my emotions enough, just yet. When I do work, I work by myself, for myself as a personal gardener and an artist. Sometimes I teach, or I used to. So it's not taxing employment in the slightest. But still the thought is too overwhelming.  My meds are helping. It just takes time to heal from being so sick. I'm on sertraline to keep the intrusive thoughts at bay, and to help my depression and emotional stability. Prazosin for the insomnia and nightmares. And they're working. Slowly. I wouldn't be here if not for the meds.  I spend most of my days alone, which I prefer. It was a conscious choice. I only have a few close friends now and rarely go out. You know those superficial friends you hang around with because you're lonely or bored? I had to cut them out. Too much energy was being spent trying to please them, and I couldn't be my honest, true self with them, and it took too much energy to maintain those friendships. I prefer to spend my time with my dog and my daughter, and reading, drawing, and writing.  But since CPTSD affects one's motivation, sometimes it's hard to be creative. And that's okay too. It's just part of my illness.  If someone asks why you are being so quiet while you're having a panic attack, and you feel safe with them, tell them. People can be surprisingly helpful sometimes. Or if you don't feel safe, just say you're really tired, getting a headache, forgot about something. I'm the queen of excuses. ;-)  Other things that have helped me besides the meds were changing my diet. I saw an allergist and it turned out I was allergic to some foods I hadn't ever been before. Once I cut those out, my sleep and adrenaline really improved.  Listening to binaural beats in the delta range works well too. I read a scientific study that doing so helped vets with PTSD, and since I'm so desperate for relief, I'll try anything. To my surprise, it helps me sleep a deeper sleep sometimes. Those are good days.  My dog is amazing. I don't go anywhere without her. She is a great excuse for getting the hell out of an uncomfortable situation too. ""Oh, I have to go. My dog's waiting for me in the truck.""  What kind of music do you listen to? I'm always looking for new tunes."

""PTSD symptoms are generally grouped into four types: intrusive memories, avoidance, negative changes in thinking and mood, or changes in emotional reactions.  Intrusive memories (1 required)  Symptoms of intrusive memories may include:  Recurrent, unwanted distressing memories of the traumatic event Reliving the traumatic event as if it were happening again (flashbacks) Upsetting dreams about the traumatic event Severe emotional distress or physical reactions to something that reminds you of the event  Avoidance (1 required)  Symptoms of avoidance may include:  Trying to avoid thinking or talking about the traumatic event Avoiding places, activities or people that remind you of the traumatic event  Negative changes in thinking and mood (2 required)  Symptoms of negative changes in thinking and mood may include:  Negative feelings about yourself or other people Inability to experience positive emotions Feeling emotionally numb Lack of interest in activities you once enjoyed Hopelessness about the future Memory problems, including not remembering important aspects of the traumatic event Difficulty maintaining close relationships  Changes in emotional reactions (2 required)  Symptoms of changes in emotional reactions (also called arousal symptoms) may include:  Irritability, angry outbursts or aggressive behavior Always being on guard for danger Overwhelming guilt or shame Self-destructive behavior, such as drinking too much or driving too fast Trouble concentrating Trouble sleeping Being easily startled or frightened Intensity of symptoms  PTSD symptoms can vary in intensity over time. You may have more PTSD symptoms when you're stressed in general, or when you run into reminders of what you went through. For example, you may hear a car backfire and relive combat experiences. Or you may see a report on the news about a sexual assault and feel overcome by memories of your own assault.""

For me, it's a goal I'm working toward, either a financial one (I'm saving up for something important) or I'm gaining skills and experience, etc. ADVICE: Set a goal to motivate you to go to work.  2) I actively am looking for another job while still keeping my current job.  You know the saying, it's easier to find a job when you have a job. ADVICE: Start looking for another job.  3) Manage the discomfort and use your job for your own growth.  I do this when I'm stressed out at work or something happens on the job to trigger me.  I use it to help me by taking deep breaths and moving into it deeply and letting myself experience that emotion in my body instead of pushing it away which never works. ADVICE: When you're at Target and the lights and people bother you, take a moment to breathe and experience it.  If you have to lie and say you need to use the bathroom or go get something from your car or whatever, you can excuse yourself and do this breathing.  Or even if you end up crying in private, THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT! It's a release of that energy building up inside you and can help you move forward.  Does any of that make sense?  If you want to talk further or if the breathing thing I mentioned doesn't make sense, feel free to PM me. Hope it helps!"

There are days I call out ""well ""but it's really a c-PTSD thing. However I have also done what renoyes does,  tell your cats if I don't work you don't eat. I very often go out the door to the job and tell the cats it's kibble money. There are times that getting up, taking a shower, and going to work are huge accomplishment and you should pat yourself on the back for it. There are other days that staying under the covers and being alone or whatever  you need is okay too. I know employers don't think the same way. I am an assistant manager and they will never get my employees crap for calling out when it's not a regular thing. There are just days you need a mental health day."

Sometimes it's just good to come into work even if you have to leave midday - at least you made it and made it that far. Take small steps to building up a resistance. At the end of they day though, if the job is eating you alive, it's really important to find a way to move onto another job."

Sleep docs might help if a therapist / MD+meds cannot.     Being your old self is not always an option.   Things like the severe trauma we live through in PTSD make permanent changes to us.    We can find a new definition of ""me"" or ""self""... but we rarely can go back to the person we were before. This isn't a bad thing.   It is real.    Everyone changes, even without serious trauma.     Very few people can stay the old ""self"" that we get used to.     Talk to your support group/ network,  docs, therapists, loved ones, and trusted friends.. or those that you do have.   Feel out what you want to become, and work on becoming the new person you can be.     Going back isn't always an option - but working on becoming the best new person you can.. is always available.

I feel like I'm trying to convince a rock to speak English, so no help there. I haven't seen an official therapist yet but I have had a few opportunities to talk to different ladies in the mental health care system for 30 minutes- hour while getting set up on my new insurance. I haven't been prescribed any meds yet but I'd kill for a benzodiazepine. The anxiety was so severe one day, I know it would be helpful. I'm not ""self-medicating"" right now but I did try alcohol experimentally to see if it helped me loosen up and it didn't, which is kind of a shocker.  I think therapy and meds are the right answers, it's just a shame how long the process/ appointments take because I am suffering now but still have to wait a month to see someone. :/ I don't know if I should try another support group. My social skills went from amazing to offputting with the passing of this event. I went to one support group and really was a buzzkill. Like, everyone was talking and laughing and able to open up emotionally. And I was silent, then when it was my chance to talk bursted out with a few things and everyone was like ""Woh, woh.""

Personal relationships is the last corner of my hypervigilance. I am not surprised that trust and intricacy are most challenging to me, and I am not as sad about it as Iwas at first.   Anything you can do to move toward acceptance will lead to you feeling more free to experiment with how you let people in.

Only you can decide when you want to take the risk, or challenge, to have a relationship. I won't tell you it's easy or safe. I have my own PTSD struggles with it. I am in my first truly safe relationship in 40 years and I feel the same as you, that everything will end badly all the time. I think that is a PTSD thing, excluding the fact that sometimes we choose bad relationships. I can't tell you that it's always going to be safe. I can tell you that for me some relationships have been very rewarding and better than being alone. You have to choose carefully and you have to accept that sometimes you will get hurt, which is very hard when  you've already been hurt many times before, especially with PTSD.I am in a serious relationship and I struggle with this regularly but I know that I am loved and accepted, even if I do not always feel that way personally.  Sometimes it feels good to be alone and that's not bad. Other times people need to be with another person even though it might hurt and that's okay too. It's harder for those of us with already been hurt so many times before. I hope that when, or if, you feel you do want a relationship with people, you're able to step out on that ledge, because it is a ledge. It's not safe, although it can be safer depending on who it's with. For  now, if you're happy being alone, that's okay too. I wish you the best"

He was hard to find, but I was determined.  The shame used to be overwhelming, but now it is a flickering shadow. I found that forgiving myself was the key. It was dirty, tear filled, uncomfortable work, but the shame was a key piece that set a lot of other things at ease. I am not ashamed anymore because I KNOW I did everything I could think of to survive. I know I was powerless to do anything else, and there is not shame in that. I forgave myself. It was far more powerful than forgiving anyone else.   Through that process my hypervigilance weirdly began to relax. Not always, but I built upon the times it did and can now enjoy a lot more than before. It was a bonus side effect of not feeling the shame.  I still get angry. Life is not fair. And the grief can sidetrack me, but it gets easier and further apart as I keep working.  It's a tangle, not a broken shell, so it has to be pulled and teased and left alone for a breather before you come back at it with that fine toothed comb.   Twisted, not broken, that's my motto."

Just live life for a while, and when you feel ready to tackle it again, it'll be easier to find the motivation to continue.   Really, though, it sounds like you may need to look for a therapist specializing in cptsd, who does one of the less talk-focused kinds of therapy. DBT, EMDR, etc.  When I'm feeling like a lost child, I give myself the time and attention I never got back then. Sometimes that means wrapping myself up in a blanket, grabbing a teddy bear, making some comfort food, and watching a movie. Sometimes I pull out the coloring books and markers or crayons. Sometimes I go for a walk in the woods. On really bad days, I give myself pep talks and remind myself that I'm still loveable and worthy; I'm just having a bad day and it will pass.   As /u/mydaddyisadrunkass said, forgiving myself was a huge piece of the puzzle, but another really big part was simply accepting that I was afraid. I spent a couple of years basically unable to leave my house, and once I worked through the fact that I was still terrified of my abusers, I was able to do a bit of exposure therapy, and get out there.   It's still a work in progress, though. I've taken on the attitude that just like I'm always learning something new, and will never be done with that, I'm always going to find new ways of seeing what happened to me, and finding new ways of coping."

For me, it's taken about a year of therapy and pushing myself hard (emotionally) to start making significant progress. I developed cptsd after childhood emotional abuse and domestic violence. Many episodes of it unfortunately.   It sounds like you are done talking about it and processing it. I recently came to that feeling too. And I too was starting to feel more depressed about it all and just had this feeling of being stuck on it. It was a weird feeling. What helped me to move on, to be honest, I think it was exposure therapy. Putting my self in a situation that I would never usually put myself in.   The situation was everything I had generally been scared of. (In my case it was a huge drinking fest with lots of drunk people. It's a huge trigger for me.) After I soaked it up, tried to socialize in it, being who I wanted to be, even if just for those few moments. I found that afterwards, back at my house, I had this really strange feeling. In a way I still have it. It was like my brain changing. I kind of felt depressed and stuck still, but something deeper was happening too. I started to think about the core reasons that I have cptsd. About those people that affected me, and I just moved to coming to some sort of emotional terms with the things they did to me. They hurt me. That was it. They hurt me and now I can move on. It wasn't the world, it wasn't me. It was them, back then. Not anyone here and now.   I'm not sure if any of that helps. But that is what helped me move on from a point of feeling ""will this ever get better?""  I've been searching my mind, my emotions, my pictures, letters, the internet, addresses, exploring my past like crazy to try my hardest to put myself back in that time I was a child. When I was going through all that shit. Doing that to process it and doing exposure therapy is, I think, what really helped me.   Thanks for reading. It seems long. :P"

ptsd,37e6lk,CaptainBludclot,3,Wed May 27 05:39:32 2015 UTC,"Personally, I can agree. After the events which resulted in my PTSD I got depressed. But other than that, I was doing alright for myself. I know that the PTSD displayed itself at times but I thought that it wasn't so bad. About 6 months later, it started to hit. And it hit hard. I developed an anxiety disorder. My blood pressure and pulse picked up. I felt like I was dying. I began developing OCD tendencies and started fearing for my life day in and day out. I shut myself in the house and refused to leave. I didn't leave my house for 3 months. I had panic attacks nightly. The only time I did leave was when I went to the hospital for a panic attack that I thought was something much worse. 3 months of hell.   It's been 1 month since my anxiety has bested me. Today I feel a million times better than I did 3 months ago. I can finally leave the house and walk around. I'm getting myself a job and helping out my neighbors with their spring yard work.   I know for a fact that wasn't the last of it. My anxiety finds subtle ways to show its face throughout the week but I'm sane enough to keep it tucked away. Another peak is definitely on the horizon but for now im going to enjoy my life as much as I can until then.   I do believe that PTSD peaks and gradually gets better. But I don't believe that after that peak, it goes away. There's a lot more to it. It's just not that simple. The peaks could be the tops of mountains in an entire mountain range. Ultimatelty, it's up to us to work on ridding ourselves of PTSD."

ptsd,37e6lk,st_gulik,2,Wed May 27 21:53:22 2015 UTC,"So basically in ELI5 terms, PTSD is our lizard brain overreacting when we are triggered by something related to our past trauma.   EMDR is a type of exposure therapy like CBT, but it uses various systems to active the left and right sides of the brain in an alternating pattern during the exposure therapy to help alleviate the overreaction and rewrite the brain.  I woke up during spinal surgery. The worst I got was throwing up during medical scenes in movies and panic attacks before going to the doctor's office that were just routine check ups.  I've been great since my therapy, twice to my doctor's office and even watched a show with some extreme medical events that didn't phase me at all. I even had blood drawn, and while my body did not enjoy it, as I'd been fasting, mentally I was fine."

They gradually worsen and then peak, then fall off until I'm in remission again. Each episode is worse than the previous one. And the acute symptoms last longer each time. This last episode started in September of 2013. I'm just now getting back to normal.  This time I'm going to stay on my meds, therapy, hug my dog a lot, and try to keep a low stress environment.

Have you guys seen a therapist, either on your own or with your awesome sounding wife?  You're right, I think you could use a little outside help. I would first make an appointment with my General Practitioner. They should be able to recommend what treatment options you feel comfortable with. And ask your wife to go with you.

With a lot of us just admitting there's a problem and getting motivated to go talk to someone is too overwhelming.  I think you would benefit from some medication too, like an antidepressant. You don't have to be on it forever and it will buy you some time. Your brain could heal and then you could gain some perspective.  As for feeling purposeless, how about volunteering for something like Habitat for Humanity? Some of us have a problem with motivation, but if you can it might really help. Not only would you be providing real help for people, but they would really up your carpenter skills and you'd learn a lot. You'd get to work with great guys, a lot of them vets, and form a real bond of comraderie. You get to see a real result from all your hard work, move in day is really a special, fun day to be a part of. Plus, it looks GREAT on your resume. You can even take your dog to the job site."

I was taught to measure my progress in percentages instead of black or white. It is easier to build on my progress in percentages.   For instance: I tend to isolate and was isolating 90% or more of my time when I first started measuring. I had an A in avoidance! (which is not what I wanted!) So I took my 10% of not isolating and doubled it over two weeks, then doubled it again over the next two weeks, and hovered for a while at 40% until I got more comfortable and upped the number again. I felt a little silly giving myself credit for babysteps but it worked for me.  Good luck!"

I made it, or so I thought, through so much and the odds were always against me, but I smiled and laughed and helped. Now I lost everything. I lost parts of me that got me through the worst times in my life. The child in me that lived in constant fear and had awful things happen with no one to love me, protect me or to turn to for any comfort to the adult that tried to make the best of things while being abused and brainwashed and tortured. And now this! I am afraid of everything, all the time and I feel hopelessly alone most of the time. I found love through this and I can't enjoy it because PTSD destroys me. Ugh, I just don't know what to say here, but I can't believe this is happening. Why do I not deserve any happiness or a break. I have no coping skills and the ones I do have, I need help with for now. I need to get them back. I'm sorry this is the worst comment ever, I'm just in a very bad place."

But that's usually me having a panic attack and losing my ability to think rationally. Nowadays I take a Clonazepam and keep myself busy till it kicks in, I used to be unable to stop the sad and horrible thoughts that made me feel so bad, so I'd stay up completely busy until I passed out from tiredness. If you are getting overwhelmed by the thoughts and can't control them, I'd see about something to help calm you like Clonazepam for the really bad times.  If it's not so much thoughts as feelings then it might just be you want/need closer relationships, or have something holding you back from making close relationships and therapy might be a good way to figure out what's causing it.

In this situation you were working against the fire to make things better and it seemed like you cut through any freeze response with your helpful and courageous actions.

My brother was physically and emotionally abusive until he was 21 when he finally moved out. I was 17. If you're still being abused, try as much as possible to get distance from these people, both physically and emotionally. The distance helps to know you will not be abused again and then you can start healing. If your parents are not being supportive, I would work as hard as possible to become independent of them. You have to take care of your own needs, no one else will. Your needs are important and worth fighting for and living for. Set boundaries around your needs. Stick firm to your boundaries.

As someone who has PTSD, my recommendation would be to tell her you are proud of her for having survived that trauma and you admire her strength, that she should be proud of herself for getting through it, and you think that her flashbacks/PTSD symptoms are like battle scars or a medal/badge of honour that she made it through something terrible.   Let her know that you respect her and you admire her strength. That would be really touching to hear as someone with PTSD."
ptsd,36xlpm,Jan291,2,Sat May 23 02:39:48 2015 UTC,"I did tell her that in a way, she had already beat it once - because she survived her past and moved on to make her own life. It seemed to kinda help. It would make sense if she felt ashamed of her episodes though, because she prides herself a lot on being independent and strong - and then she sorta got hit with delayed PTSD out of nowhere after years of being relatively fine and having already moved on. I'll have to keep that in mind."
ptsd,36xlpm,cyanoside,1 point,Sat May 23 16:27:00 2015 UTC,"A lot of the time, PTSD symptoms makes me feel like I'm not a normal human being. You should continue to treat her normally. She knows that you are there to help if she asks for it, but right now it sounds like she wants to have a normal, healthy friendship and not be coddled.   You are being a good friend and a good person by respecting her wishes and boundaries."
ptsd,36xlpm,jenesaisquoi,1 point,Sat May 23 05:00:40 2015 UTC,Gotchya. And thanks! I'm glad to hear that even just respecting her boundaries and holding normal conversations can be helpful.   :)
ptsd,36xlpm,PaddingtonBear03,1 point,Sat May 23 16:33:28 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the things I went through (almost died of rare disease, survived a fire, attacked by a homeless man) because they have made me appreciate life more and formed me a lot. That being said, it still messed me up a lot.   I'm glad you're trying to help your friend, but the best advice I have for you is to respect what she says she needs. Perhaps you can email or text her to request some instruction to help you help her if you feel like your need to know is greater than her need to not talk about it.   It sounds like she gave you some pretty clear guidance. When she has an episode, she needs to be quiet and apart, and after, she just wants to act normal again. So do that. If you had a friend with a stutter, you'd wait for them to finish their thought-out wouldn't give them sad pity emotions eyes and try to hug them to help them get through the stutter. You'd just be like, you've got this, buddy. And then make a joke or tell another story and move on.   Tldr my advice is this: pretend she has a stutter and you're just waiting it out. Treat her as your friend, not as a damaged person."

I see there being 'acceptable' traumas and 'not-acceptable' traumas. A car wreck,  a soldier experiencing combat, or a person fighting cancer seem to be acceptable in this culture, while rape, child abuse, and domestic violence seem to be 'shameful' and most people can't seem to stomach hearing about it.

Society doesn't want to deal with things like child abuse/rape/war and truly take action against that and I think that we sense that society was willing to sacrifice some members and that does cause people to feel shame. The good news is that it is nothing intrinsic to us or who we are right ? It's not something personally wrong with us, it's these awful things in society that are allowed to go on. And we were strong enough to survive these terrible things and get through them.    I try to do the same as you and be proud of my battle-scars. I earned them damn it.

I don't even get grossed out in gore movies I mostly just find them silly and laughable.

ptsd,36t2dr,bodhibell02,1 point,Thu May 21 22:04:49 2015 UTC,"I can't speak to all of what you posted, but I can respond to some of it.   First, I have the lack of motivation when dealing with people. Hobbies are a fantasy world escape for me, and I'm terrified of losing my job, but I want to have friendships and relationships and I have zero energy for doing those things. The energy output that I imagine in my head is far higher than what I have available, so I talk myself out of trying. ""What's the point?"" is exactly the right description for it. I don't have any helpful advice to offer there.   As far as analysis paralysis, sometimes I can talk myself out of it using a combination of things. One, is to tell myself, ""fuck the word 'best'! That's a stupid word."" My sister said something yesterday that really gave me pause. I was describing how there is ALWAYS something I could have done better or put more effort into and she said, ""It doesn't matter, you did enough."" I'm still mulling that over in my mind, but I think I like it. Two, is to break it down into smaller and smaller and smaller pieces until you feel you can handle 'what's next.' I've had to get things down to as small as ""refill the dog water"" and then ran out of mental energy for the next three hours.   Which leads to lack of brain power... I don't know your story, but mine has to do with trying to develop an identity that I should have had a chance to do as a child (I'm in my late 30s now). Unfortunately, I'm trying to do so without making a clean break from my past. I constantly get frustrated with how long it takes to do things that used to be thoughtlessly simple.  I will sit down to start something and look up and it's hours later with not much done. Also, I can't multitask anymore. I used to be able to work on two or three things at a time and switch back and forth between them all day. Now, I can only focus on one thing a week, at best. It's definitely a symptom of the depression that you talked about and I don't have an answer for it, other than to keep going.   Good luck to you."

ptsd,36q2x7,milatheguardie,2,Thu May 21 05:49:07 2015 UTC,"Honestly, you can probably safely tell your employer that you have PTSD. PTSD doesn't have the same ""scary"" connotation to most people that comes with other mental illnesses like bipolar or schizophrenia. The fact that PTSD was very common for US veterans helped normalize the condition somewhat.   Maybe you can sit down with your managers (together or individually) and let them know how it affects you. You can ask if they'd be okay with you taking your break or part of your break early if you're having a hard time. Just explain that you want to be the best you can at work, and that's pretty tough to achieve if you're in the thick of an anxiety attack.   I am lucky enough to be in charge of my own workplace, so if I need to take 10 minutes to go for a walk around the building and center myself, I can. I don't work in the same building as my boss, but she knows and she's supportive. If she calls me at my desk and I don't answer, she'll call back later."

My boss has been overwhelmingly supportive. She knows all of my diagnoses and at one point we went out to lunch together and I told her basically my entire history. I've been referred to several group therapy classes and she's allowed me to take the time off for them.  It has definitely helped me at work to have someone who understands (at least as best as she can without having said illnesses) and is compassionate.

After awhile I found it less effective.   I couldn't do the eye movements back and forth (I'm a very visual person and it was disorienting), so we used buzzers in each hand that buzz alternately.   Now I go to a therapist who practices Somatic Experiencing with me, along with talk therapy. I have found that the somatic style fits better with my personal experiences and my personality... I have become very body-aware. I like using the sensations in my body to tell me what I'm feeling. Some of the work we do occasionally involves pushing against a pillow & my therapist pushing back to release anger. She also has me growl and stuff. Mainly it's very trauma focused talk therapy.

ptsd,36mdf2,thesupporter1,6,Wed May 20 13:14:39 2015 UTC,"I think you should talk to your therapist about how to handle this. I think your brain is just trying to process the trauma and trying to figure out how safe it is to be around men. I don't think you should tell your boyfriend that you are less relaxed around him specifically, but tell him that you are just going through a difficult part of therapy and you are more on edge and vigilant or however you want to phrase it. Communication will help him be more sensitive to your needs and thus you will have a better relationship and trust him more.   Hav you tried self-parenting? It is like telling yourself what you would say to a child if they were having these fears. So try telling yourself ""I'm safe right now"" and doing some grounding exercises to keep yourself in the present."
ptsd,36mdf2,cyanoside,5,Wed May 20 13:38:46 2015 UTC,"I have been dealing with this recently as well. It's pretty common to conflate our partners with the perpetrators of abuse. I would be open and honest with both your therapist and with your boyfriend. Even if withdrawing from him physically is what you need right now, being forthcoming with that information and with the fact that it has to do with your trauma and not with anything he has specifically done can go a long way toward helping him be supportive while you're going through a rough patch.  I highly recommend giving Healing Sex: A Mind Body Approach to Healing Sexual Trauma a read. It discusses the challenges of navigating a relationship while recovering from trauma, and has exercises you can do solo and with a partner to help build trust and physical intimacy without being explicitly sexual."
ptsd,36mdf2,resealableplasticbag,7,Wed May 20 20:10:46 2015 UTC,"My suggestion would be to be VERY careful how you word this in your head.   For example...  You are scared of erections.   You are scared you will arouse him.   You are scared you will ""tempt"" him.   These are all very distinct fears with very distinct solutions and I would take them to him and your therapist to work though individually.   I'm going to address the last one bluntly. You are not responsible for tempting him by existing, having breasts or being close to him. That's on him. Period.  This is a sexual abuse and just plain abuse and also religious theory that drives me absolutely insane.   No one is responsible for another persons thoughts or actions. PERIOD. Our abusers use this to blame and shame us into compliance. Its not true. Different variations of religions use it to put more shame on women's bodies than is  fair or even right. Men are NOT animals. They are responsible for controlling their urges according to your boundaries and then their morals, but your boundaries have to be part of that equation.   And also. Erections are a physiological response to all kinds of things. Waking up from REM sleep dumps serotonin into the body which causes a morning erection. When it starts men are not aroused. Its just there. They can wake up and think thoughts that cause arousal but the erection by itself is NOT arousal.  Men can be stimulated to an erection and raped and never be turned on.   Its vital that you try to solve some of these issues with some good science. It will help you figure out your responsibility in the arousal process and his and also the male body."
ptsd,36mdf2,tbarnes472,7,Thu May 21 04:10:48 2015 UTC,"Just to add to your last couple points:  Men are just as emotionally complex as women. I suspect a much higher percentage of us ignore it, and that definitely isn't healthy. Almost certainly this is a result of the cultural expectation that men are ""strong"" and ""simpler"" than women.   You're 100% right that erection != arousal. Not only is that true, but it is worth noting that it is not uncommon for men to be unaware of an erection, ESPECIALLY young people like teenagers. If you're in school right now, one of the boys in your class has an erection. He has no idea how he got it, and he can't pay attention anymore because all he can think about is how the hell he got it and how to get rid of it before someone notices."

ptsd,36mdf2,Vindalfr,2,Thu May 21 21:16:53 2015 UTC,"I occasionally go through similar things with my SO as it relates to my abuse. We can head it off if we notice it (now, we weren't always so fortunate/experienced) before it gets bad, but failing to do so can result in issues.  I second the notion that you should talk to your therapist about this because as I see it (in my scenario), my brain is effectively lying to me. There are ways to help see through that in the moment so people like us can become less activated and can recover from such incidences more quickly, but your therapist will have better insights as to your approach.

Also it's entirely possible your christian beliefs are also giving you greater anxiety.  To me, it sounds like you need a positive sexual experience.  Not really sure what you can do about it, if you don't want to have sex, you're going to have to try to find another outlet for your sexual anxiety.  As others have suggested, it sounds like you need to find therapy or a support group."

Some of what you're going through is a natural response to stress, but if it goes on for a long time or gets worse as time goes on, you should think about talking to a therapist. You should think about it no matter what, because it sounds like you're going through something really tough. It's great to get professional support.   Even before I had ptsd, sometimes I felt like the bad things in life had changed me for the worse. I would be more closed off, or just less innocent, or really self-defeating. I used to be angry that ""the bitch"" won and the ""good me"" didn't make it through the tough times. But then I realized that the shit times were sort of like the way that you strengthen steel, known as strain or work hardening. By deforming it, you use the weaknesses inside to create something stronger and less breakable. Right now you might be feeling pulled and flawed, but maybe someday you can turn that pain and discomfort into resilience.   I'm not saying that you'll end up stronger, because not everyone does, but strain hardening is a metaphor that gives me hope, and I hope it might give you some as well."

I don't understand the need for diagnoses. From this post, it sounds like the problem is with doctors who treat labels and not people.  I can see the diagnosis codes that are used for billing and, depending on what kind of provider it is, the diagnosis codes entered for charting purposes. It's both interesting and amusing. The internist and the psychiatrist used different diagnoses when my the complaints were exactly the same (the initial wait for a psychiatrist is several months). The same doctor will add a new diagnosis when nothing changed. My favourite diagnosis is from the clincal neuropsychologist: unspecified persistent mental disorder due to conditions classified elsewhere, though I think this had more to do with the brain injury than anything PTSD-related.  The diagnosis isn't important to me. I don't meet the diagnostic criteria for PTSD, but I've still been diagnosed with it. (The neuropsychologist thinks the criteria are wrong and said that some of them will be changing soon.) I have certain symptoms that are post-trauma and related to stress/anxiety that I want treatment for, but I don't want treatment for PTSD in particular.  Do you, the submitter and others, want the diagnosis for yourself or to change the behaviour of medical practitioners?"
ptsd,36jga2,btdn,1 point,Wed May 20 02:00:14 2015 UTC,"I couldn't give a damn about getting a label on it. It is what it is. While it's much less of an issue with the bipolar (which after my most recent, undoubtedly manic phase, I'm not really in doubt about) because the NHS hands out psych drugs like candy, even though mechanisms of action and indeed efficacy are pretty much unknown and unproven for most drugs and most indications. The Seroquel/quetiapine was prescribed to me to prevent relapse into depressive episodes. I stopped because of the side effects, but later read in AstraZeneca's own literature that no study had shown that the drug had a statistically significant advantage over placebo for that indication.  That's a problem in its own right though, a whole other story. The problem is that, whether I care or not, I need the right label to get access to the right treatment any time soon. Which is why I am going to have to find a way to be treated privately - the NHS requires the label, but also decides who gets the label.  It particularly gets to me that it was agreed that I suffered all the requisite symptoms with the requisite severity to meet those criteria, failing only at the subjective interpretation of a sentence in the ICD-10. Surely it's the symptoms that matter, and how can anyone begin to claim to know how traumatic something was to me?  I sometimes wonder if my ""game face"" coping mechanisms screw me over. I've never had a consultation report which didn't mention that I seemed socially confident, cracked the odd joke, etc. But that's how I operate, and in fact how a huge number of people suffering from mental illnesses operate - the outer facade is the absolute last thing to crumble.  Your last point about the exact diagnosis not mattering is bang on. It just seems that mental health in the NHS is very much label-based, and it's in the private sphere that you get doctors who actually treat you, not a pigeonhole they try to put you in. I have two close friends with other mental health issues, both of whom struggled and suffered for years in the NHS system, and seeing a good private psychiatrist turned things round like magic. I think it's the only way. I don't see why it should be - I don't honestly think the last doctor to see me honestly believed that there was nothing wrong with me, but I can totally see that in a situation of limited resources and bureaucracy, the system just forces that utterly ridiculous, rigid approach."

I have been diagnosed with ptsd, it has been confirmed by several psychiatrists over the years.  Irish doctors are not so used to it as perhaps American doctors are.  But they are getting better.   It took ten years of bouncing around with no diagnosis or understanding at all before my symptoms were recognised but that was partially my fault because I didn't know what flashbacks were so never admitted to my experience of those symptoms as I thought it meant I was insane.  You need to listen to yourself, BUT you really need to listen to your doctors too.  Ask for explanations of you don't like the answers, have discussions.  In my experience the symptoms of ptsd absolutely do over lap hugely with some personality disorders, and it shares symptoms with other conditions as well.  For example I suffer depression, anxiety, anger, insomnia, but they are related to my ptsd, but those symptoms would match 100 diagnoses without the full picture.  That is why you need to discuss this with a medical professional.  Ask to be referred on by your gp to another if you like to get a second opinion maybe?"

So if someone was really into video games, sure. But otherwise I think you lead to friendship far more than anything else.

I want to be a part of it so badly. I want to jump into the stream and let it carry me away, floating along through life and all its ups and downs with everyone else. I don't want to stay where I am, alone and confusedly stuttering at each and every turn and decision and event I come across. I want to be someone, to have an identity that isn't torn and frazzled and paper thin. I want to know what everyone else knows so I can be on their level. Or maybe it's that I already know too much, and I want to un-learn it and live in blissful ignorance.  Eh.   Being around people is hard at first, but it does help. Therapy is always the best recommendation. Especially since we are all so different. I do find that finding someone that I enjoy and can really focus on is helpful when I start feeling really upset.  For me, it's doing math out of old textbooks. For some it may be drawing (or coloring - I have a coloring book designed for adults and it's pretty neat and relaxing), exercising, going outside, etc."

It makes the world seem frightening and distant; I suddenly understand how people become agoraphobic.   Therapy helps. Spending time outside helps.

ptsd,36bwws,claylow,3,Mon May 18 03:28:00 2015 UTC,"Two major pieces of help I can share are:  1) Cognitive therapy from a GREAT provider. I used to see a famous guy (who was famous for a reason: he's awesome) until my medical insurance ended (it would reimburse me). Most of these problems are thoughts, not a part of YOU, the physical person.   2) A portion of these problems are because your amygdala (the primitive, fight-or-flight portion of the brain) got overstimulated when you were young. It's now so hypervigilant that it freaks out and tells you you're in danger even at normal stimuli (like being alone).   When the amygdala is on red alert, it shuts down the frontal cortex's ability to think rationally and to problem solve. There are now lots of news stories and information about findings about this effect.   This was an important learning for me.   My former therapist prescribed Lexapro to see whether it chilled out my amygdala. It did. I always thought I understood what it was to be a normal person but being on it (until my insurance ran out) showed me that I was mistaken... Lexapro showed me what it's TRULY like to be more normal.  It was amazing; I could contemplate things I found stressful, without feeling panicked or worried or the slightest bit not-calm.   So, if you haven't tried that or something like it, and your doctor recommends it, I say yes, try it."
ptsd,36bwws,seekinghelphere,2,Mon May 18 03:52:13 2015 UTC,"I relate to this a lot. The only difference between us based on this post is where we were born and our parents. I dissociate a lot, and did exactly what you did at the age of 18; I didn't get thrust into that kind of privileged crowd straight away by going to TAFE before University though, so I was able to manage a lot better being around people I felt I could relate to. I was still living at home for my first semester of uni as well, and in that semester I did okay because I was still in the same mindset that allowed me to function in that environment. During that semester my brother was especially abusive and a friend of mine committed suicide, I don't know how I managed to pass a full time load on top of travelling 80km to and from Campus upwards of four days a week, but I started paying for it after I moved out of home and onto campus. People thought it was weird that I hadn't been on a plane, let alone been overseas, I didn't understand the differences between dayboys and boarders and why either were necessarily shitter than the other and even my place in the family (one of six kids between five individual parents) is an absolute spin out for them.  I come across as semi-functional by having a twisted sense of humour, smoking shit loads of pot and seeing a psychologist. I've also tried making more of an effort with keeping things tidy so mess doesn't seem as overwhelming."
ptsd,36bwws,FarKingCnut,2,Mon May 18 05:07:58 2015 UTC,"One other question, do any of you all have constant intrusive thoughts about random dangerous things that could potentially happen to you? For instance, when I walk home from the lab after class at night and see strangers or cars, I assume that they are potentially armed or are going to hit me. These are just quick thoughts I have that I don't allow to effect my path home or smiling at passersby, but they do spike my adrenaline and constantly pop up.

I commend you for being able to make it to your senior year at such a great, intensive, and competitive university. That is a big accomplishment in itself for someone with our unique illness.  I think taking some time off is a great idea. This is the perfect time for you to get a handle on your symptoms and to learn more about your condition, so that you will have the tools and knowledge to accomplish your life goals and be successful.  You are so lucky to be at an institution with such incredible resources. Please reach out to your university's support systems and don't be shy to admit you need a little help. You have an illness that is exacerbated by stress. Your professors and your Student Life Dean should be made aware that you have a problem, you are aware of it, and your are trying to overcome it. That should buy you some time so that your can recover a little.  Please seek out a psychiatrist or even better a neuropsychiatrist that specializes in PTSD. You can not get well from your illness without medication. It would be as if I had pneumonia and was trying to train to run a marathon. I would not be able to even think about doing so without starting a course of antibiotics.  /u/seekinghelphere is correct. Your ventrimedial prefrontal cortex, your amygdala, and your hippocampus aren't functioning at their best. This is causing your symptoms of intrusive thoughts, depersonalization, and hyper vigilance. No wonder you can't think straight, and until you can break this cycle, you won't be able to do so.  /u/Sapperdoc is also right. Exercise is incredibly helpful at burning up the excess adrenaline that is causing such symptoms like your trichotillomania. Sufferers of PTSD have a problem with motivation because of our hypo active prefrontal cortexes, but if you can force yourself, even a nice walk or bike ride will do wonders. Don't beat yourself up if you can't find the will to do so however, it is your illness that inhibits you. It is not your fault or a weakness of character. You may just feel too sick on some days. Those are the days when your brain needs rest in order to heal itself.  And /u/FarKingCnut 's suggestion of keeping your environment tidy so that things don't seem too overwhelming also rings true for me.  Talk therapy is incredibly important, but with our illness we can only overcome it with help from medication. I could talk about having pneumonia and how it makes me feel crappy all the live long day, and it would help me to be able to cope with living with my symptoms of not being able to breathe, but I wouldn't get well and get rid of those symptoms without the help of antibiotics. KWIM?  Once you talk to a psychiatrist or neuropsych, they should be able to give you a definitive, medical diagnosis of PTSD. This will empower you from a legal standpoint and your university and future schools will have to assist and accommodate you because of the Americans with Disabilities Act and you will have documentation of having a legitimate disability.  For now, see your General Practitioner about some short term anti anxiety meds. Once you start taking them, you should feel some relief within a couple of days. Then you will be able to get some rest and be able to think better. Please feel free to PM me if you need further assistance, or if you need to vent, or if you are just feeling alone and are scared. I'm sure we can brainstorm together some further solutions for you."
ptsd,36bwws,seekinghelphere,1 point,Mon May 18 12:10:14 2015 UTC,"Sufferers of PTSD have a problem with motivation because of our hypo active prefrontal cortexes   Can you share more about this? And about any other effects of a prefrontal cortex in hypoactive mode? I'm very interested to understand how this all works, and I was only told that the prefrontal cortex being so shut down, makes it hard to engage in calm, rational thought rather than freak-out.  I wasn't aware that it also made motivation a problem but now that I read this, it's an ""A-ha!"" moment. It clicked that, yes, the more agitated, or scared, or worried I am, the even harder time I have doing anything. So I want to find a solution. It sounds like calming my prefrontal cortex WAY down is the key?"
ptsd,36bwws,-gogo-,1 point,Mon May 18 16:14:40 2015 UTC,"I wish it were so simple. The area of the prefrontal cortex known as the nucleus accumbens is responsible for talking to other brain components and transmitters, like dopamine, so that you feel more motivation. Since your prefrontal cortex is already hypo active, or slowed down, so is your nucleus accumbens.  ""...positive outcome information lost its salience for patients with PTSD. This may reflect decreasing motivation as the task progressed.""  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18597797"

I am definitely going to search for a provider, organize my space, and start going to the gym. These are all great suggestions.

I've just started abilify (not sure if it will work or not) as well as propanolol, buspar, gabapentin, and fetzima. I am really medicated but I still don't feel relief, so I am trying to push my psychiatrist to find a mix of only a few meds that will actually change how I'm feeling.   Thanks to everyone for your responses, they are very encouraging and it makes me feel much less alone and lost. Thank you especially to GoGo for pointing out that ptsd is a disability- I've never looked at it this way, I just thought there was something broken about me.

ptsd,36bwws,worriedaboutlove,1 point,Mon May 18 15:03:18 2015 UTC,"I used to exercise a lot. Somehow the endorphins calmed me down and had an antidepressant effect and it was also motivational.  Like you I was also in a demanding program and it was difficult. It was also difficult because I felt like it was a rarified environment in some sense, most of my classmates who got in and stayed in were not struggling emotionally the way I was and it was lonely, they kept unintentionally making cruel statements to me.  Even one of my professors when I talked to her about the things I had been going through at the end said that maybe 3% of the students in my program were going through the same challenges I was. That was hard because I would have probably felt less alone in terms of my struggles hanging out with unemployed mental patients but I couldn't do that. It's almost a downside to being high functioning. However a lot of classmates did try to help me.   The feelings I've started to recognize as abnormal and that I hate the most are the extreme feelings that I am alone or empty and incapable of relating to those around me, extreme guilt over being a burden to those around me, and powerful feelings of hopelessness.   I'm so sorry to hear that. I remember being at school and positively feeling like a crazy person constantly. The only thing I knew to tell myself is that, ""I can feel like a crazy person and feel like I belong in a mental hospital but I don't have to act like it.""   I am also grateful to my uni for being a place where I could feel safe and part of a community during a vulnerable time in my life.   I am partially grateful to mine as well. The school counselling centre and psychiatrists were generally not helpful, but many professors, advisors and other students went out of their way to be helpful. I would not have gotten through without them.    I can't help but feel like I should've gotten help sooner so that academia could have been my focus instead of having to channel all my focus into holding myself together   I wouldn't blame yourself entirely. It's hard. I tried to get help but the school counselling centre made me feel like a problem the first day I went in and I ended up seeing an outside counsellor who was abusive to me. Then man who abused me as a child started contacting me and I was worried that he would abuse his stepdaughter and stepsons. You can do your best, which you did. I guess you didn't think of seeing a counsellor but honestly you never know what can happen, even if you had done everything right unexpected things can still happen."

ptsd,36bk2p,sandy59,5,Mon May 18 11:25:31 2015 UTC,"Yes, out of shame I fool almost everyone. I now realize that feeling shame over how I am is irrational and counterproductive, just like a woman's shame over being beaten by her abusive husband or a child's shame over being sexually abused by anyone.    So since shame only hurts me instead of helping me, I try to be open about how I am. A person with combat PTSD might not feel ashamed at all to say ""I was around a lot of bombs blowing up my friends in Iraq, so it kind of recalibrated my brain to flip out when I think I'm in danger,"" so I remind myself of that and force myself to feel less and less embarrassed as time goes on, to speak up about how I have a hard time doing normal things because I was in a lot of fucked up situations earlier in life.   (I will say that it took me a LONG time to even understand that what I experienced qualifies as abuse and neglect. I always had thought because other people had it worse, that my experiences didn't count as abuse and that I was just being a wimp)  I'd like to tell you that just because some person told you you were ""incapable of the human condition,"" that's bullshit.   I seriously doubt it was a member of the medical community. If it was, I bet the next 10 medical professionals you asked, would disagree with that statement.  I hope you work on something more constructive than drinking. Drinking will FUCK you up and at 25 you're just at the beginning of the slide downward.

Consciously, I thought being either ignored or yelled at by my parents just meant they were busy or weren't interested in me or what I had going on.  Later as an adult, I realized that in the back of my mind, I had unconsciously concluded that I had no value. Not that I was bad, just wasn't as special or interesting or loved as other kids.  I also thought (and still sink back into thinking) that I am just made wrong, am defective, etc. I didn't understand that thinking as I do and behaving as I do is what happens to most people when they experience what I did.  It's normal."

It's normal.   That's true it is normal. It was only when I started to see the same thing that happened to me happening to other people that it woke me up and hit a nerve in me. Now I am beginning to wonder how many children/teenagers are going through what I went through and how many more people it has to happen to before someone does something about it.  If you're like me (and I think you are from the way you wrote the above, but you should be the final judge really) you tend to be stoic about it and sort of unconfident about telling what happened to you almost unconsciously expecting to be disbelieved and not taken seriously. I think that this a mark of severe abuse and PTSD/dissociation actually because we are sort of dissociated from it and ashamed of truly telling our story. I was just reading a book about how abused children have to convince themselves that they are bad and evil and that if they just work hard enough at being good things will be OK in order to preserve any sense of security and sanity in their world. If we saw our parents the way they truly were growing we would have had no sense of security or calmness at all. I think this is why some of us felt the shame of thinking that it was our fault and not really abuse for so long and are only just getting out of that."

ptsd,36buec,RENOYES,1 point,Tue May 19 12:49:54 2015 UTC,"Things were a lot better today and I think I know why; after everything yesterday my flatmate decided to move some things into his room to stop people hanging out in our house as much, which in of itself is a smart idea that should help things. In doing so he moved a fish tank as well, and after tidying up the empty bottles it not only looks a lot less like my dad's house did during some time I'd blocked from my memory but without the fish tank and filter sounds less like it too. For context, the years after my parents separated are kinda hazy up until I was around age 10 and I never remembered too much about hanging around with my father during visits before that; all I remembered was going to strange houses and waiting in the car whilst he'd ""drop something off for a friend"". After the recent weeks of fairly heavy partying and not much chores on my part as well our place slowly started looking more and more like my dad's. It probably hit a breaking point because I recently found out why those visits stopped, and it's because he'd deal drugs, bang his girlfriends and have strange people coming and going. After finding this out I remembered the moments I told my mum about as a kid, two guys who drove a tipper truck and playing video games with other kids whose parent/s hung out with the same crowd as my dad. I guess because so much of that is blocked and judging by the way I feel about certain body parts I think someone may have done something to me.  The hard part is whether to seek closure now, later, or at all.  EDIT: Added a note about sound, the extra sense being triggered by the situation is probably worth noting."

Your first step needs to be separating yourself from your fears. The next time you're freaking out, can you do me a favor - study it? Note every change your body/mind undergoes, no matter how small, measure how long it lasts. Breathe deep, and breathe slow - it'll help you recover a little quicker.

For me, someone with PTSD, verbalizing my experiences really helped me to mentally process them and to have more control over the thoughts. As I mentally explored all of the traumas that happened to me, it took months to realize there were other traumas that I forgot about, or maybe suppressed. Either way, it takes time and consistent mental exploration to help, I've found anyway.   A side note too - something I've seen regularly in this community is that PTSD can be misdiagnosed.

ptsd,366zj1,hukt_onn_fonnix,2,Sun May 17 15:26:49 2015 UTC,"Start with the VA or a Vet Center, which is a smaller VA run local clinic kinda thing. If he just shows up with something that IDs him as a vet and says he wants to talk to a counselor, they'll be able to get him going in the right direction. It's great that you want to help him, but PTSD and addiction definitely merit professional treatment. Also, get him to as many AA meetings as you can. Best of luck, Source: Afghanistan vet w/PTSD and recovering alcoholic."

If I can ask, did you go through the VA and would you say it was helpful? We are just worried about him feeling like he's just a drop in the bucket.

I have a safe place in which I can vent my frustrations about his illness.  I am social and i like to go out. His illness has him staying indoors and only going out when necessary.  Therapy lets me vent about the illness and the therapist helps to reword anything I may say that he might hear in a way I didn't mean.  Similarly, he gets to vent about things I do that drive him bonkers, like lose my temper or push him too hard.  I just want to say that you're not alone. It's a hard road, but it's manageable if you work together. :)"

ptsd,364vyl,FawkesOrion,2,Mon May 18 19:57:59 2015 UTC,SO here. I have ways to try and relate to my SO. I know it's not the same as understanding what she's going through but it is enough to remind me to be patient and compassionate.   If something arises I'm not sure how to handle I try my hardest to do what she needs or let her know I'm there for her. Then a few days layer we talk about it. What we were both feeling. What she needs me to do in the future. And things that she can try and communicate to me so I know what kind of help she needs or doesn't need.   While I understand it is my responsibility to learn and do what I can on my own for her she does need to help me because every person and every trigger is different  It's been and continues to be a learning experience for both of us.
ptsd,364vyl,HeartofaFighter,1 point,Sat May 16 07:52:11 2015 UTC,"I went through the same thing with my last SO, actually a few SO's. I bottled everything up as well, then lashed out at someone I supposedly loved and cared for. Thus we both built deep resentment toward each other because we never fully addressed the issues. Furthermore, once we communicated our ""problems"" with each other, we choose never to come up with a game plan on how to fix things... until it was to late. My point is, until my ex SO's resentment took over her clarity of our relationship, she was also very supportive and understanding. She always tried to help me in everyway possible and I never gave her the true credit she deserved. But eventually people will get tired of dealing with another person's baggage. After we had a horrible breakup, in which the effects of the relationship seemed to last forever, I had more space for self-reflection or me time.  My advice is find some alone time and try to address the patterns that you see effecting all of your relationships. Positive and Negative. Obviously I recommend the typically advice of therapy  but going out and meeting  new people will help immensely too. Read about  cognitive awareness and attempt explore your thoughts. Moreover, try to be mindful of all your thoughts. I also recommend trying DBT along with other mindful practices. Anyways, I wish you the best and I feel for ya."

The headaches would be so bad I'd feel completely sick and nauseous.  They have almost completely stopped after about 6 months or so of therapy. I used to take one or sometimes two ibuprofen, and that would make it go away. Or just deal with it as much as you can. Laying down always helped me."

I'd say trying to relax or drink tea is about the only other thing that seemed to help. You have to think, your mentally stressed out, very anxious. It's kind of normal to be tensed up ready for action. So doing anything to calm that down will help.

ptsd,360yk2,cmrlmndz,2,Fri May 15 04:19:30 2015 UTC,I have PTSD from childhood sexual abuse and I am using EMDR to move forward with my recovery process.

ptsd,360yk2,Drabbeynormalblues,2,Fri May 15 05:28:53 2015 UTC,It took me one session. It didn't eliminate the trigger but it greatly reduced it. It was 2 or 3 sessions in before I started noticing elimination of some triggers. I'm still not there with other triggers after a month.
ptsd,360yk2,-d_u_d_a-,2,Fri May 15 05:47:19 2015 UTC,"EMDR was the best therapy I have every tried, by far for PTSD resulting from sexual, emotional and physical abuse.   The relationship with your therapist is also very important, so you're therapist probably won't take it personally if you don't quite click with him or her, and want to try someone else. But EMDR has made me a lot more aware of triggers, reduced their intensity, helped with my insomnia, among other improvements.   I've seen my therapist off and on for about 4 years."
ptsd,360l48,mafioso122789,7,Fri May 15 02:07:33 2015 UTC,"I got back from Iraq in '06 and I'm still dealing with this shit. Tell you what, though, it's gotten a lot better and things continue to improve. I know how you feel, but think of it this way. It was your job to fight, and to die, if it came to it, or get injured in the line of duty. If you'd gotten shot, would you be surprised that you were bleeding out just because getting shot was part of the job? Would you have just let yourself bleed out because it was part of the job? No, you would have gotten that shit patched up ASAP so you could get back in the fight because you had a job to do. Did your buddies fail at being soldiers because they were injured or killed?  Well, you did get injured. That's what this is. You're not making it up. It's 100% real. It's just not physical. No one is immune, just like no one is immune to bullets and IEDs. Not everyone gets shot, but if you do, it doesn't matter how high speed you are. PTSD works the same way. This is what war does to people, and you're not alone. Everyone in the unit I deployed with came back with symptoms, and I don't think any of us saw the kind of action that you did. Some of us needed help. I needed a lot of help, and so did some soldiers in my unit that were a lot harder people than me.  You're still a warrior, and you still have a mission. Your mission is to get well, be the best person you can be, and find the happiness that you've earned fighting for your country. So here's what you do. Save the number 1-800-273-8255 (Veteran Crisis Line) in your phone and call it if you're ever experiencing an emotional crisis. I've called them. And you can get on here (or send me a PM) to vent whenever you feel the need. Start talking to your doctor, or find one you can talk to. If you haven't already, go to the nearest VA hospital, get registered, and apply for a service-connected disability rating. If you need additional mental health resources, the VA hospital has them, and you can also look into the Vet Center Program, which is more oriented towards mental health and is considerably less bureaucratic. That's where I go to see my counselor, and she was a veteran herself, so I feel like I can actually talk to her. It takes time and hard work to get well, but you didn't join the infantry because you were afraid of hard work."

ptsd,35y5uq,Psilocybrain,11,Thu May 14 14:24:14 2015 UTC,I confronted my Dad about his abuse and he laughed at me and completely shut me down.  I've had to accept that he may deny it forever.  You may have to accept that there may not be a reason for the madness or that she may never give that information up.  Gaslighting (convincing the other person something didn't happen when it did) is a common abuse tactic as well.  It's good that you acknowledge your own suffering and know that it is valid too.  If you trust these people and feel like it's necessary then tell them but be prepared to have to make peace with this on your own without her acknowledgement.  Best wishes and if you need to talk then PM me and I will listen.
ptsd,35y5uq,dongledongs,9,Thu May 14 14:54:35 2015 UTC,"1st, my experience is nowhere near as bad as what you went through. But I want to add towards something about perpretrators denying they ever did anything wrong.  There was a ""friend"" who lived near me, who I found evidence of stealing from me, irrefutable evidence of repeated petty theft. Anyway it was junior high, I was going to graduate in a few months so I figured I'd never see him again. During senior year of high school we'd run in to each other for some reason. He was a continual jerk, so I brought up his petty theft. Instead of showing any remorse, he acted indignant, ready to fight, started screaming and shouting. It wasn't worth it, so I told him to forget about it, because again, I wouldn't see him ever again. But notice, the denying.  It doesn't end there, when I was young, my mother would beat the living shit out of me for having 'poor' grades. I would be terrified of letting her know I got anything below an 85 so I'd leave the test in my bag. Sometimes, before I had the time to hide them, she'd go through it at midnight, wait till I'd fallen asleep, then storm up the stairs so loud it would instantly wake me up, she'd then slam open the door, then proceed the kick and punch me all over and then make me go downstairs for a further session of beating and berating. After I was exhausted, filled with thoughts of suicide, she'd let me go back to bed. I'd then spend most of those nights praying to any god out there or anything listening to end my life early. I'd also cry because I was too cowardly to just kill myself. I was also bullied intensely by others during junior high and sometimes would cry in the shower during the morning before going there. I'd knew certain days would be awful. My mother couldn't tolerate crying. She'd do the same as before, bust in, proceed to beat me and make me feel like I was so pathetic. The list of things she did to me goes on and on and it gets worse.  But, to this very day she denies ever doing any of that. You'd think it would be impossible to forget, especially the time she stormed in for no reason with a knife to my neck. Nope. She denies all of it. Says I'm crazy. However, a few years ago she did mention, ""ShrimpCrackers, I may not have been the best mother, but I tried my best"". I wasn't sure to spit or hug.  People are assholes.  Yes you should talk with other relatives and she should apologize, but if not, you should shut her out of your life. In fact you have reason to shut her out right now. She molested you. It was wrong. She may not be ready to face that fact, but it's not up to her. You should get the help of your other relatives and they need to know what she did. Some will side with you, some will not, some will straddle the fence. It doesn't matter. This should not be your burden alone."
ptsd,35y5uq,ShrimpCrackers,6,Thu May 14 15:02:30 2015 UTC,"PS: Your stepmother may abuse other children as well. Your relatives need to know otherwise the young in your extended family may get abused as well. This is a preventative, necessary measure."
ptsd,35y5uq,ShrimpCrackers,7,Thu May 14 15:09:22 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it sucks but you will probably never get an apology, an explanation or even an acknowledgement. Abusers rarely if ever come clean, and the more pressure you put on them, the stronger they will deny it.  My stepdad molested me, and denied it up and down to the police, but when they offered him a lie detector test he practically bolted out the door. To this day I'm sure he maintains that I made it all up, but I've stopped caring. I don't need him to validate my experience; I know what happened. My family knows what happened. That's enough.  It could be a good idea to tell your relatives about it, both to ""out"" her and to get some validation and support... although if you think they might take her side, it could backfire and I would also prepare for that possibility. I don't mean to be harsh, but I doubt you will get any kind of closure or understanding directly from her, at least not until she's on her deathbed. Your energy is probably better used on something besides that horrible waste of human life called your stepmother."
ptsd,35y5uq,alush,5,Thu May 14 16:39:40 2015 UTC,"It's good that you have reached a place where you feel safe confronting her. That says a lot about your strength and your struggle - you have probably worked very hard to deal with the abuse.  Gaslighting is something I know well. I wore a few people down until they had to admit what they did. Another was drunk when they abused me, and refuses to admit anything ever happened.  But know this: no matter how much the wicked step-mom wants to deny what she did, her actions have come home to roost. SHE now must face her own evil, even if she acts to you like she has no memory of it. She knows what she did (unless she was under the influence of alcohol/drugs to the point of blackout) and now she knows her actions DO have consequences.  Yes, tell other family members. You will know who has your back and who is an enabler then, but more importantly, you may be protecting other young men.  DON'T let her gaslighting make you question yourself one bit, as I did for years. You know what happened; she knows what she did. She can't hide from it anymore. But be prepared for her to run your name into the dirt.  Stay strong, and I am very sorry for what you suffered at the hands of an evil person."
ptsd,35y5uq,grundyhippie,5,Thu May 14 16:10:17 2015 UTC,"My mother sexually molested me from the time I was in diapers until I was 10 years old and allowed several other men to molest me as well. I confronted her in therapy twice and got straight up denial about it. She even tried to convince the therapist that she was a good mother and brought up other ways she abused me to ""keep me in line."" She left with her head held high both times that she was a good mother and I was the one who had problems.  I know what happened and I don't need her validation to tell me as much. Continually badgering her only put me into an emotionally vulnerable state where I was further abused by her denial and other abusive behavior displayed in session. I did not want to continue to put myself into a situation that was not emotionally safe for me so I cut off all contact. It was the best decision I ever made for my own sanity. I not only was able to work on my own healing process better without her interference, but I was able to weed out which family members would have her back versus mine. As far as I'm concerned good riddance to bad rubbish.  I spent a lot of time angry about justice after I made the decision to go no contact. I'll never know the answers to who did this to me in terms of who these other guys were. I recalled my memories after the statute of limitations happened so even if I had answers there isn't much that can be done about it legally. I also realized that I'd have to go through the confrontation process all over again just to most likely go no contact again which is what I already had right now.   I eventually realized that my justice comes from moving forward and moving on and not letting this dominate the rest of my life. You deserve happiness, you deserve peace, and you deserve to move forward. I learned to forgive because forgiving doesn't mean that what was done to you was right, it doesn't mean that they get away with it, but forgiving allows you to let the pain go so that you can move forward with your life. For me it was partially a mourning process and partially learning how to cope with not having answers. I know that my mother knows what she did even if she never utters that out loud. My mother wanted a relationship with me and she is denied that so she has to mourn my loss out of her life and I get the peace of mind of knowing that it was her actions that caused it. For me it's very comforting to go to bed at night knowing that she has to stew in her own misery. She can justify it any way she wants to in her own mind but it doesn't change the fact that deep down she knows what she did and why we have no contact now."
ptsd,35y5uq,Drabbeynormalblues,4,Thu May 14 17:25:34 2015 UTC,"Needing your family to know what happened is about sharing an important truth.  Abuser thrive on lies and illusions.  They don't want you to tell the truth and will constantly deny the facts.  You want your abuser to recognize the truth because you were programmed to not believe yourself.  I believe in you. Not your sick and twisted abuser.   Some family might not be ready to accept what you have to say, but saying it is powerful and you heal by telling the truth. Just try to let go of how ready they are to hear it. It took you 20 years,  maybe they need time too."

There were criminal cases against my abusive/sociopathic ex and his friend....His friend's case was dismissed w/o prejudice (it can still be reopened anytime) last week even though there are pics of this scumbag doing the crime (they stole a lot of money from my account)...

But I guess I know I can always bring this up and he will hear me.

I like the end of the day before I go to bed. I hand write tomorrows to do list (fuck my memory) and note and challenges/triumphs/haunting memories,  sometimes I write a letter that is not meant to be sent.  I thought it would bring up too many feelings, but it calms me as it gets put on paper. Also, setting a time and keeping the ritual allowed my brain to bring things up when it was more convenient.    It takes times to find the words and feel understood.  I found it worth the time."

Now I have a therapist that is absolutely amazing and has been from day one. I wish I had met her 20 years ago. I knew therapy is confusing because you no if you're right or wrong, but 95% of the time you should feel better when you leave therapy not worse, no matter how difficult the things you discussed were. If you don't feel this way, maybe look for a new therapist, one who specializes in PTSD or complex PTSD. There are too many out there who think they can treat anyone, and they can't. They end up doing more harm than good. Perhaps your therapist isn't one of them but I've had some who are. Good luck."

I guess 'better' is kind of subjective though. My idea of good therapy is being able to explore the stuff that I'm too scared to deal with on my own, and that often leaves me highly emotional in some form. So emotionally I feel worse when I leave, but I try to process it rather than run away and thats a good thing in the long run.  I honestly don't know if he's good at what he does, or if I trust him yet because I don't really trust anyone anymore.   Whats your understanding of a good therapist?

ptsd,35x7a6,Pippafert,2,Fri May 15 06:18:09 2015 UTC,"PTSD is hard to diagnose and takes a long time to realize that you may or may not be PTSD. Your circumstances sound like it could be possible. Please go to see someone who is a specialist in PTSD and see what they say. Even if you diagnose yourself as ptsd, it's not going to help with the recovery.A therapist who specializes in that can help you enormously. A therapist who does not may not make any difference at all."
ptsd,35x7a6,MyrtleLoadTheShotgun,1 point,Fri May 15 03:15:52 2015 UTC,"The thought of ptsd came into my mind a few days ago. I was on a forum site and someone said that I COULD have ptsd. I'm not running around saying I have it or believe I do, just wondering cause of my background, and why the NC shooting out of all tragic events had set something off inside of me.  I will see a few docs and specialist. Like most people out there, I don't know much or anything about ptsd. Like many I thought it was something that only soldiers caught coming back from war."
ptsd,35x7a6,jenesaisquoi,2,Fri May 15 07:18:30 2015 UTC,"I thought the same thing for many many years. I did the same thing you did, the thought of PTSD just came into my mind and then I started researching it. After 30 years of trying to get a diagnosis of some kind. After that, I brought it up with a therapist who agreed that it was very possible. It's not something that only happens to people with traumatic experiences like war or natural disasters. If you look into complex PTSD, you'll find that that is something that usually deals with childhood forward. Some very good books are waking the tiger by Peter Levine and complex PTSD from surviving to thriving and by Peter walker. You might want to read through them and see if anything resonates. I would suggest the second one first, it's more relatable in a lot of ways. I wish you the best and patience while figuring it out. It's been so over looked for so many years, I feel frustrated that for many years it was never even considered in my situation. But that's the way it is sometimes and I'm grateful now I'm able to address it properly."

I know how you feel..I'm a VERY quiet/private person....but someone that works at my night job also happens to work during the day at the same court that I go to for my restraining order and the criminal charges against my ex and his friend.... I'm so paranoid that she will tell people.   The info is out... All you can do is go to work with your chin up and continue to do your job and hope that she won't say anything.  If she brings it up, pull her aside and tell her that you regret telling her that personal info that you're usually not comfortable sharing and to please never mention it again to anyone.  You didn't do anything wrong, you have nothing to be embarrassed about...if she decides to gossip about you, SHE will look like the asshole not you. Stuff like this is not something people usually gossip about at work so hopefully she won't."
ptsd,35p4d2,Sun_will_rise_again,3,Tue May 12 11:53:16 2015 UTC,"I did this once in a similar situation.  I texted the person and asked them to keep it confidential as it was a very personal matter and that it would be distressing if it was used as fodder for gossip and that I was sure they would understand that no one would want people sharing information of such a personal nature about them and that I really appreciated their discreetness.  Not sure if it worked, and I did feel very awkward and shame filled around that person for a few months. They responded saying they would be discreet though. And I didn't notice any change in behaviour towards me.  It is very hard to deal with, even telling people I do trust is very difficult. Rather than feeling like I'm telling people about something horrible that happened to me, I realised it felt like telling some one something horrible about me.  One way that I have reworked my thoughts about this by remembering that it is a negative reflection on other people if they are judgemental. They are being assholes.   Even if this person is so emotionally unintelligent that they think it's appropriate to talk about you in a disparaging manner because of something you had no control over, not every one will, and they will only be showing even more people evidence of their own poor character.  On the other side, this person was also drunk. One of the reasons, even quite nice people list off things that could have ( in their opinion) prevented a trauma is that it protects them psychologically from reality. There's a reason people say they never thought it could happen to them when something awful does happen. When you don't have ptsd, and don't see the dangers around every corner, believing that there are no real personal dangers is a part of normal functioning. Yes there are monsters you here about, but it's easier to imagine they are far away and that you're safe. When someone that you know, that is in your social group starts saying things that mean the monsters do hurt people like you, they're not just something you see on TV or read in the news, they are here, in your life hurting people you know, people tend to wig out over that. They instantly start protecting their bubble that keeps them able to live in the world listing all the reasons it would never happen to them.   You could read about the  just-world fallacy which is a cognitive bias that causes many of these problems. It helped me understand why I was angry at my self, but shouldn't be, as well as why people react like they do to misfortune effecting others."
ptsd,35p4d2,BallPointPariah,3,Tue May 12 12:26:20 2015 UTC,"That's a horrible reaction on her part. I'm sorry she reacted that way. If she brings it up again, you can talk to her about it and tell her why her responses were hurtful. You can also asked her to please not talk about it because it gets you upset. (This is probably the route I'd take, to be honest. Since it's a coworker I'd rather end it instead of raising awareness.) If she persists you can talk to someone higher up and see if they can get her to stop.   Please, don't feel embarrassed or stupid for sharing your story. There's noting to be embarrassed about and there's no reason to feel stupid. Telling others what happened can do so much good. It can help get things off your chest, it can help you sort through your own feelings, it can help raise awareness, and it can help other people. The helping other people part is my favorite. One time I wrote a Facebook status about what happened to me. My cousin told me to stop talking about it because it was inappropriate to tell people about it. Obviously, I let him know why he was wrong. Do you know THREE people messaged me that night saying I inspired them and they were finally ready to get help and start healing. One time in college I mentioned what happened to me and this girl I was starting to become friends with kicked everyone out of the room except me. She slammed the door behind them and sank into the chair across from me and burst into tears. I was the only person she ever told. She told me talking about it helped so much.   Nothing that happened is your fault. You made no mistakes. You did nothing wrong. Nothing that happened is something that has only happened to you. You are NOT alone."

I always think of some of the amazing courage survivors have when they speak out about the negative things that have happened to them. Kind of going public in a way. If someone wants to try shaming you over what happened to you, then they are soulless people.  You could also try talking to that person and asking them to not tell anyone. It might be an awkward conversation, but it may give you peace of mind?"

ptsd,35nj45,sothazi,2,Tue May 12 07:56:00 2015 UTC,"At the risk of sounding trite, your best bet will to be to talk to him and ask him what would be most useful for him during this tough month. Unfortunately, PTSD is very person-specific, so I'd hate to give you a suggestion that would inadvertently upset him more.  Off the top of my head: Maybe let him know that you are there for him and while you can't understand what he's dealing with, you want to be as helpful as possible during this really hard time. If he needs a bit more ""benefit of the doubt"" if he's short with you (within reason) or more hugs or whatever, that you are happy to do it.  Best of luck, OP!"
ptsd,35nj45,parasaurolophus,2,Tue May 12 01:51:09 2015 UTC,"The other commenter has a good point, but i find the best thing you can do to help during a panic attack is to distract them from the trigger by asking the questions, or talking about something different or interesting or just plain silly depending on what you think would pull them out of it. Good luck to both of you!"
ptsd,35nj45,GravitySkies,1 point,Tue May 12 04:05:17 2015 UTC,"Depends what sort of troubles he's having. I could have written your post myself, and time has helped with some symptoms but exacerbated others. Early on, during nightmares (vivid, recountable or recurring dreams) and night terrors (thrashing, talking/yelling, but no idea what happened upon waking) placing a hand on his shoulder and/or saying things like ""it's ok, you're home, you're safe"" in a quiet, soothing voice helped a lot.   Understanding that anger isn't necessarily directed at me or because of something I did has helped me a lot. Providing opportunities for him to talk to others about his experiences (we're both veterans and us talking about it leads to a loop we can't seem to get out of so we just don't do that as much as possible) seems helpful for us. Accepting there will be bad days, there will be a couple sleepless, or nearly so, nights and planning to take the day easy when that happens. Encouraging naps, on that note, as we often feel a need to be productive even when we're exhausted.   Learning to allow him to simply be alone when he isn't in a mood to be nice has saved us. Accepting the other needs space sometimes, and we will both be safe (eg no driving when wound up) even if we aren't together during the worst of it is helpful.   If flashbacks happen, simply following his instructions (stay where I can see you, don't let anyone behind me, etc) and accepting he won't remember much of them is useful. Remaining calm in the face of their emotions is useful, but not always doable.   A great book to help understand is ""The Warrior's Guide to Insanity"" which you can listen to, read by the author, for free. It's also great for him, but my SO and I agree reading it is one of the hardest things we've ever done. Good luck."

It will put him at ease that you are totally aware of what is going on and are willing to help him. When I am suffering attacks, I do not like to be touched. My SO asks me tell him the date and year and where I am and who I'm with, this is very helpful for me."

He's one of those unique people that is allllways thinking so in May he tends to zone out a lot. Lost in thought. May is also the time for more naps/sleeping in because of restless nights.

It could be, at least in the U.S. that people had zero knowledge just a few years ago.   With some charities and other organizations raising awareness of the huge number of troops returning home - with insufficient wealth, skills, and education to survive, -and- many afflicted with PTSD...  They raise money and awareness for the plight of returning soldiers.      Those otherwise ignorant folks only have one context to put this disorder in.      Keep looking.

I do avoid some things; if I know there's going to be a lot of loud noises, sharp noises, or sudden movements, I try to avoid the situation and if I can't avoid it, I'll doing my therapeutic methods before, after, and during those things. It really helps to be able to fall back on those methods and although I hate being on as many meds as I'm on, I am grateful for them because it's a constant that helps keep me stable.  I'm sorry you're going through this, it absolutely sucks hairy monkey balls. Just know this, it CAN get better! While I still struggle, I have improved so much since I was diagnosed with PTSD!"

It still feels like a complete and total shock that I have to rebuild, ALL over again. I can highly recommend DoYogaWithMe.com if you are interested in trying a fitness class in the safety of your own home. Everyone is different, but I cannot express how much yoga has helped me reclaim control over my body and rebuild self-esteem. Hang in there, you are right, you're going to be okay.

ptsd,35ivll,Daenye,6,Sun May 10 20:27:47 2015 UTC,You can request that a female does the examination... That might help you feel more comfortable.  I've had it done about a month ago... the female doctor that did it was awesome...very friendly and gentle...and she used the smallest tool (The tool they use during the gyno exam that holds it open) there was so it wouldn't hurt as bad.  My doctor is aware of my PTSD/history so maybe they knew to be more gentle.  Don't be afraid to tell them if you are uncomfortable.
ptsd,35ivll,Sun_will_rise_again,2,Sun May 10 21:51:50 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I had issues with my last doctor who used to joke about women being uncomfortable when she examined them. At that time I did not think about how unethical that was.  I will definitely follow your advice. Thank you, again."
ptsd,35ivll,rewardiflost,7,Mon May 11 18:19:32 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry you have to go through this with so little time or prep.   Not a woman, but I suggest:    -  see if you can call therapist asap, and maybe spend 3-4 minutes on the phone discussing ways to cope.   -  definitely speak to the examining doctor about your issues.  All of your health history is something they should know, and especially if you might panic or at a minimum clench up during examination.   -  Depending on the reasons for the exam, they might be able to work without so much touching or prodding.. or perhaps they can talk to your other docs/therapists and get you some additional anxiety meds.   -  Bring someone with you, if you have a friend or family member that you trust.   They can stand behind you, or facing your head and out of the doc's way.   I sat with my wife during a couple of painful visits, mainly just there for hand-holding and moral/anxiety support.      If the doctor doesn't change how they treat you when you tell her/him about your PTSD issues, I'd avoid that doc.   He or she thinks there is no reason to change, maybe they are already perfect.. or they just don't know how to deal differently with patients that have other needs.     I know you are living this, not me.   I can't know what you are going through.   When I had to deal with annoying docs about my own trauma,  I got worked up leading up to the appointment.  I was unhappy, angry, and even panicked during the appointments.    But after - I was able to calm back down and get my head straight.   You probably are strong enough to endure this, just one time,  and it won't break you or leave you with more damage."

ptsd,35ismv,cyanoside,2,Sun May 10 20:01:51 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you feel very ashamed. I'm sorry to hear you feel like that. I'm also sorry that the conflicting professional opinions are making you feel undeserving. That would make anyone's PTSD or symptoms of having trouble with a trauma feel worse. It sounds a lot like PTSD to me given how much shame you are expressing here. It's OK to feel ashamed but I hope you realize that that doesn't mean you are actually any less deserving or a bad person.    Other times I feel like it is happening again, only I feel all the things I should have felt at the time but didn't.    However you felt at the time is OK. The definition of traumatic events and trauma means that they shouldn't even be happening at all, because they are things that humans are not built to go through and come out of being OK. Sometimes people come out of them OK but we are not built to withstand that.   I feel angry and terrified and I fight. Maybe I don't deserve a diagnosis because I'm not in enough pain; because the memories are often emotionless.   This is the definition of PTSD, people feeling numb and emotionless and like they can't feel the pain and process it so it just goes on unendingly. I understand that it's frustrating to feel that way but if it was that easy to just make yourself feel the pain and process it none of us would be here on this sub reddit, we would have all felt the pain and gotten over it and we wouldn't have PTSD anymore.  Firstly please take all of this with a grain of salt because I'm not a professional and even if I were I could be wrong about things. It also sounds like the professional who wouldn't diagnose you with PTSD ended up making you feel ashamed. I don't know what you may have thought/felt like as a result of that. From what you said above it sounds like you felt they didn't think you were in enough pain to deserve the diagnosis as you say above? Or did you feel that your numbness about it convinced them you weren't bad enough to be diagnosed so now you feel more ashamed and undeserving as a result of your numbness? Also I think that even if they aren't sure it has been long enough for you to have PTSD yet they should take into consideration that you know your feelings best. You might be saying that you feel ashamed and asking for some support or empathy to get through things and that's a smart request to make that should be taken seriously."
ptsd,35ismv,Jan291,1 point,Mon May 11 03:54:54 2015 UTC,"I am confused and ashamed because I don't know how I'm supposed to feel and so I feel broken. I can't function as a normal, healthy person. It had been over 6 months since the trauma... the therapist had a policy that I needed to be stable for 2 months in treatment with her before an assessment. Is that weird? The crux of the traumatic events happened exactly a year ago. I felt like she didn't believe me that I was in so much pain... I felt it was cruel for her to make me wait 2 months to even talk about it and I needed to process it so badly. It took me a long time to get to the point where I realized I needed help with it."
ptsd,35ismv,jenesaisquoi,2,Mon May 11 05:47:54 2015 UTC,"I think it's likely not rare to wait to give a diagnosis, but your therapist should be helping you establish your goals. I would ask your therapist some questions, and I would be clear about a few short and long term goals you have.   When I started therapy (the third time) I knew my short term goals were to be able to drive without panic attacks and to get through a semester of school. My long term goals are to manage my triggers and to climb out of the deep, dark hole I was in. I knew that I wanted cognitive behavioral therapy, and I made sure to ask if she used it. I also was pretty sure I wanted medication, and I was upfront about that. It sounds like you're where I was the first time I tried to get therapy, so don't sweat it.   I would, however, ask your therapist some questions. Ask her what her estimated time-line is for getting you to cbt. Ask what she plans to tackle NOW, while you aren't stable. Ask her if she thinks medication or a med change could stabilize you. Therapists sometimes tell us things we don't want to hear, but ultimately they should be working with you, and if you don't feel like she is on your side, it will be a lot tougher.   Regardless of whether or not you have a diagnosis, you deserve help right now. Especially if you are thinking (or acting) about killing yourself, you should be talking to a therapist very frequently. It's hard to know from your post what else you have going on that might make your therapist delay a diagnosis, but I would say don't worry about a diagnosis. Ask where your treatment is going.   I hope you can learn to let go of your shame. You are a person of worth, and you are hurting. Just because it's mental, doesn't mean the pain isn't real.   Edit: oh yeah, I meant to tell you about the numbness thing. One of the first things my therapist had me do was write an account of the trauma. And then when I read it to her, she asked me if I could tell that I was writing it very disconnected from myself. I had to keep rewriting it until I wasn't dissociation from it. I think the numbness and dissociation is not abnormal after trauma. I wouldn't try to infer what your therapist thinks. Ask or accept that she'll tell you when she thinks you are ready to know."
ptsd,35ismv,mydaddyisadrunkass,1 point,Mon May 18 06:16:55 2015 UTC,"You are looking for a place that holds your answers. That place would be easier if it had a name. However, a really good therapist will take their time naming a diagnosis- different symptoms will be deceptive during crisis- and their time spent will be much better for your healing.   It's not that they can't see what you are going through is real, it's really that the brain is so smart it will try to protect itself with false presentations.   You can name your symptoms really well. You have therapists with healthy boundaries. If you can, try getting used to knowing more but not knowing all yet. I needed to focus on one thing I could make better at a time. Build on what is kind of working while you sort things out."
ptsd,35ikaf,HashtagPoundtown,5,Sun May 10 18:50:29 2015 UTC,"First, it needs time.   And the human brain needs to hear the opposite idea/emotion at least 34 times before it begins to believe. NOT saying I am sorry, but saying the opposite of what you said (fat = beautiful, bitchy = loving, etc). Take her by the hands, look her in the eyes, and tell her once how sorry you are and again that these are not thoughts you have ever had before. Then take what chances you have to hold her close and call her beautiful. This is how we heal.  Good luck."

He started to get angry when I told him that I was thinking about calling his therapist and hiding the gun but quickly calmed himself down. He said he he is in constant fear of something happening to us and not being able to defend ourselves and that's why he bought the gun. He did buy some kind of lock that goes on the gun and gave me the key's as a sign of good faith. I told  him I wanted to have the gun out of our house for the time being but he refused and said that is not a option he is willing to agree to. He also said he would talk to his therapist about this and wants me to join him in therapy. I am still very upset about him not consulting me before making this purchase because it is something he did behind my back. I am still scared and don't know if he has another key or what he could even do with the lock on the gun.

ptsd,35heu4,autowikibot,1 point,Sun May 10 21:12:44 2015 UTC,"Melatonin:       Melatonin (i/ˌmɛləˈtoʊnɪn/), chemically N-acetyl-5-methoxy tryptamine,  is a substance found in animals, plants, fungi and bacteria. In most of these organisms, except for animals, its function is something other than daily organization. In animals it is a hormone that anticipates the daily onset of darkness.  It is synthesized in animal cells directly from the essential amino acid tryptophan, but in other organisms through the Shikimic acid pathway.   In animals, melatonin is involved in the entrainment (synchronization) of the circadian rhythms of physiological functions including sleep timing, blood pressure regulation, seasonal reproduction and many others.  Many of melatonin's biological effects in animals are produced through activation of melatonin receptors,  while others are due to its role as a pervasive and powerful antioxidant,  with a particular role in the protection of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA.

The sedative made me get marginally more sleep but I would wake up the next day with my entire body rubbery and sore feeling like I had been beaten up. This sleep thing was even worse for me a couple of years ago. I was on sleeping pills and couldn't sleep for four months straight after the trauma due to my anger and then once I was able to get some validation for my anger and do something about it I instantly started sleeping better. I went from getting no sleep to getting a solid seven hours. I feel like if I can get to the root of my anger somehow the sleep issue will resolve itself again.

ptsd,35gu90,EskEEtt,1 point,Sun May 10 05:34:58 2015 UTC,"I actually like your formatting, its how I think too. Unfortunately I can relate to your need to smoke on a regular basis… It really helps with a lot of symptoms and for me serves a way for me to dissociate when necessary. Maybe just having a conversation with your sister about you smoking weed? Maybe try a vaporizer or smoking outside if the smell of burnt cannabis is a problem. I think maybe due not having seen her for 4 years would lead someone to overanalyze the situation but you still need to take care of yourself too.  You can’t help manage her triggers… they are her triggers, and all you can do is be with her and help her through them. For me it was better just to recognize that I was being triggered and fell them fully. Recognize how your body feels when you’re triggered and through that gain a better understanding of your mind body relation.  Here is a link from someone who helped me a lot with understanding PTSD and the relationship between body and mind. www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6M1FumqeyM. As for utilizing LSD and MDMA for “move past her traumatic events” I wouldn’t advise it. These drugs are incredibly powerful and have the potential to take her to places her mind is now blocking and if she’s not in a place to revisit every detail of her traumatic experience it could really mess her up for a long time. It happened to me… I took some acid at a party and was unexpectedly confronted with my past right there in front of me “was not ready for that”. This experience stuck with me or about a year or so after that and increased my panic attacks and nightmares. MDMA on the other hand….was actually really helpful, but again it does bring back parts of the past that she may not be completely ready for? There is an organization called M.A.P.S that is utilizing MDMA as an assistant drug with therapy and it’s shown very hopeful results, but with a lot of preparation and under supervision of trained trauma specialists. I’m still in the process of treatment but making the connection between mind and body was huge for me!

Also, I think experimenting with drugs while visiting you may not be for the best. It's my understanding that new drugs are best taken under controlled and familiar circumstances, and it would seem to me that on a trip with lots of possible triggers and a strange house might not be the best.

ptsd,35ex8z,AnAngryBlade,2,Sat May 9 18:08:09 2015 UTC,I've been on Prazocin for a while now. It helps with my nightmares but not daytime anxiety. I haven't had my dosage increased and I haven't had issues with sleep paralysis on it.  I'm an alcoholic and my doctor knows that and still put me on it. Physically I feel like I'm doing fine - I've never been told not to drink because of it.
ptsd,35ex8z,poop_dawg,2,Sat May 9 18:39:34 2015 UTC,"I shouldn't be drinking because of the other psych meds I'm on. I'm on a maintenance dose of Xanax due to physical addiction to it (have been on it for 10+ years), and we all know that any doc would be terrified of giving benzos to an alcoholic, so I don't dare to say a word. Plus of course alcoholism is a cause of high blood pressure.  Thanks for your answer. Every time I find a psych med that helps I am sure I've finally found the ""magic bullet"" and I am always let down in the end.  But I'm so tired of waking up feeling like I've spent the entire night reliving my particular form of hell, so I still have high hopes."
ptsd,35ex8z,poop_dawg,1 point,Sat May 9 19:05:21 2015 UTC,"Ah, that makes a lot of sense. Well I'm glad the Prazocin is working for you. My PTSD includes psychosis so my dreams were INSANE and then I'd wake up (not paralyzed, mind you) and keep hallucinating and jump out of bed or start thrashing around to get away. I haven't had that problem in a while, which in its own is nice, but now I'm also more rested!!  I hope it keeps working for you. I'd say just keep track of it and be honest with your doctor if it becomes less effective. Whether it's Prazocin or something else, the important thing is finding something effective."

They probably would be gone but that sleep paralysis craziness is preventing me from doubling my dose(1mg) like I was supposed to.

I also recently started Prazosin, because Effexor causes horrible vivid dreams that, in my case, were the worst nightmares ever.

I can't say that PTSD was the main cause. However, some of my worst traumas in the years since then were specifically related to me having MDD- for example, losing custody of my son for five years after a divorce when my ex played the ""she's diagnosed as crazy"" card. Funny enough, after five years he sent my son to live with me full-time because he couldn't handle my son's PTSD and related issues.  (Edited to add: my son has PTSD because he was taken from me suddenly and without warning when he was only 5. I guess the correct term in his case is CPTSD but I'm not one to split hairs.)"

He's got a counselor and meds, is he letting the doc know he needs more?  There is also The Vet Center. They don't share anything with the VA that the vet doesn't want to share. ""It's help without hassle,"" and it's free. The counselors can see your SO with or without you, as often as needed, to supplement (not replace) the help he's already getting. Sometimes it helps just to talk to someone who actually knows what it is like to be in combat, so if that's the case, he can also request a counselor with that background.  Is he on VA disability? It's another thing that the Vet Center folks can help with... knowing how to apply, how to fill out the forms. It's a lot of triggers to complete the experience part of the forms, so your SO will need to have lots of sessions with the counselor.   The disability money can help because it takes off some of the stress of finding a job or a higher-paying job, and less stress means more energy to deal with the ptsd.  Dogs. Dogs help. The right ones, even the wrong ones, because it helps to even out the emotions in the household. Even when the humans are sick of each other, the dog loves unconditionally and is always happy to see you. If not a dog person, cats can help, some kind of pets can help. Even fish tanks have been helpful for us (but right now no one wants to take care of a fish tank, water changes every two weeks, etc.).  There's also /r/PTSDCombat . I've posted before that Patience Mason's book, Recovering from the War, was a huge factor in getting my husband to get help. It is tough reading, don't even think you can read it from cover-to-cover in one go-- but reading about other soldiers' experiences and knowing that the panic attacks and anxiety attacks were things that had names, and that he wasn't alone, wasn't crazy, wasn't the only one going through this, that helped immensely.  It's not over for us, it never will be unless he goes for some MDMA or other new treatments (if they work for him), I can't even finish that sentence.  Anyway. I know it's tough, what you are going through. 27 is a young age to be dealing with this, but the sooner he deals with it, the better.

I ended up going to see a hypnotherapist and did something called havening - didn't do the hypnotherapy but the havening at the suggestion of my talking therapist. It's relatively new technique over in the UK but MY GOD - I cannot tell you what relief one session gave me. I felt like I got my life back - now I can't say it 100% works for everyone but it did for me - and I know some people are desperate like I was to get some relief so what can 1 session hurt?   Basically --- the brain cannot hold two thoughts at the same time. They ask you to think about your trauma and work yourself up and you don't really need to tell them what its about and then they start caressing you like they would a baby and doing some tapping and audio suggestions and its meant to rewire the brain. I probably didn't explain it properly but for me it was a real life saver because I was at the end of the road.   I am looking to do some hypnotherapy when I get some money to do so but I cannot recommend havening technique enough to people.  I still have horrible memory and lack the ability to really focus now but my flashbacks are minimal if none, depression - well Im off meds now. I have down days here and there but nothing like before. I do find diet and exercise really help but I've been crap at that lately.

My own brother was one of the initial triggers, and the sudden death of my mother recently, who stayed in denial all her life, as well as his actions after her death, brought up all kinds of horror that I wasn't ready to face.   Your brother saying that veterans have more of a ""right"" to PTSD is bullshit. I have the utmost respect for combat veterans. But PTSD is not something you choose to have. The world is full of trauma and PTSD is something that happens in your brain without your consent.

ptsd,35clv8,JLunaM,2,Sat May 9 02:24:55 2015 UTC,"When I started with my current therapist, the first few weeks were just talk therapy. We needed to get oriented to each other. She needed to assess my level of trauma and treatment goals.  For stimulation, we used vibrating paddles. In most cases you hold one in each hand, and it alternates vibration. The therapist will adjust the rate and intensity depending on what kind of work you are doing. I've also used audio before, where you hear an alternating tone in each ear. The other common method is to either move a finger in front of your eyes which you follow, or sometimes a display on a computer monitor is used. Both of my therapists preferred the vibrating paddles.  When we started EMDR, we first worked on visualizing a safe place. It's kind of like a guided meditation. For me my safe place is up in the mountains on a lake enclosed by forest. Part of the work is connecting your thoughts to your body.  The next week we would first start with the safe place visualization. Then we would pick a distressing memory to work with. This could be something that triggered a panic attack, or even mild anxiety to start with. For me, social anxiety is a huge issue, and we would usually start with a recent event.  With the alternating stimulation going, you would be guided to remember the event. Every couple minutes the stimulation is turned off and you check in with the therapist. She would ask you to find where the distress was in your body. For me it's almost always in my gut, that's where my fear seems to live. Part of what helps is you'll be asked to say how distressing the memory is on a scale of 0-10 at the beginning, and towards the end you'll be asked to score it again. It usually goes down by at least a number or two. The goal is to get it as close to 0 as possible.  Towards the end of the session you usually start feeling fairly charged up and tense. So we would usually finish by spending a few minutes visualizing the safe place with the stimulation going. It's amazing how much this can calm you back down. She would then encourage self care as you decompress.  I usually feel pretty wiped after a session, and the next 24-48 hours you usually reprocess. But it starts to feel like a weight is lifting off your shoulders. After the 48 hours has passed is usually when I notice I'm feeling a difference.  You'll usually pick up where you left off the next week. Sometimes though, the last session may have taken a lot of charge out of the distressing memory. In that case, you may pick another event to work with. But what I've found is that the distress always seems to progressively erode as I stick with it.  One cool thing we did one week recently was called resource building. We did this after a couple weeks of intense work on my childhood trauma. Instead of focusing on traumatic memories, we focused on positive characteristics I had, and replacing negative self-belief with positive self-belief. Man, I walked away that evening feeling great and had the best weekend I had experienced in a long time. It was a real nice change to working with the trauma, and helped put everything into perspective.  TL;DR: It's like a guided meditation with alternating stimulation to keep your brain from overreacting. You check in every couple minutes to describe what you're experiencing in your body and mind. And you don't always work with trauma, you balance it out with work on positive thoughts as well."

ptsd,35clv8,sophiewophie666,1 point,Sat May 9 15:52:33 2015 UTC,Sure. I mean the best way to explain it is that it basically changes your neurological pathways. You really focus on very minute details of your trauma and work through them on a detailed level from a place of power while your therapist helps realign your pathways.

ptsd,35bdf4,CaptainBludclot,2,Fri May 8 18:27:05 2015 UTC,"Well, my SO is incredibly supportive but she can get bogged down by it all.   The problem is, I don't know HOW to get this stuff out. I never emoted in my youth, never expressed my anger, I fled (fight/flight/freeze) and froze. I am the 4th child who didn't have much of a voice.   I do think that if I were single, I'd sleep better. I'd have one less human being to worry about. She also is a huge trigger. Just because of the nature of what she is, love/caregiver. But I also think being alone would be absolutely awful for me. I feel stuck and hopeless."
ptsd,35bdf4,CaptainBludclot,2,Fri May 8 19:05:38 2015 UTC,"Honestly It is frustrating to me to advice people who have trouble with solitude. All my progress comes from completely isolating myself when I am at my darkest, so that I don't transfer my shit unwittingly to someone else. I was isolated for most of my childhood so luckily I'm very comfortable by being by myself.  Maybe you can take some time away from home to work on yourself and give yourself time to breathe and observe the horizon? Can you get access to another place to sleep? A cabin in the woods or something? Go somewhere and only worry about you. Bring something to keep you occupied. Make sure to tell her you need some nights alone to go to dark places in your mind, a process which will make you unsociable. Do silly things like walking around naked and shaking your stuff. Play with yourself. Take showers so long that you get verily pruned and the only cure is going to bed. Go out in the rain and get completely soaked and cold and enjoy the sensation. Bring only foods that please you and something to entertain yourself if your mind stays for too long in the darkest place. Bring movies and entertainment she may or may not approve of. Do things you haven't done since you were a child. Make sure she knows you are fine and that you love her. Return to her when you miss her so much that is the only thing you can think of. Find a way to explain to her what you did by yourself for the last couple of days.  EDIT: When you are alone and set up for the mind trip just let everything happen and don't hold back. Don't restrain yourself. Don't push back what ever comes. You are going there to go there. Let all the shit feelings overwhelm you until you get numb from emoting. When it gets too tough, go outside or take another shower. Eat. Read. Let it repeat. Let all the bad thoughts and images surface. Don't fight it. There is only you. Remember to cry. Don't stop yourself from crying loudly.  EDIT 2: Anchor. Bring some pass time that you enjoy doing alone. Bring music that takes you to a good place. Play some computer games or something. Bring some epic movies you haven't seen in a long time."

I sometimes sleep on the couch by myself. I will probably start doing that a lot more. I dunno what it is about my bed that scares me or triggers me. Maybe it is being near a partner, can't trust anyone ya know? Even when I am on the couch I struggle. Maybe I feel that home isn't safe. Ugh.   I go on hikes solo, but no access to a cabin.

Sounds like some well planned out excursion into your own head for a while is a good thing. Only real way to get rid of angst is exposure....  Best way to do exposure is in an environment where you control every single variable. How about buying a tent or renting a trailer for a few days or something? There is always somewhere else to sleep and spend a few days..

ptsd,35bdf4,Sun_will_rise_again,1 point,Fri May 8 21:04:32 2015 UTC,"For me it's not about that at all. It is about meditating on it and letting the images and emotions just play. Your only job is existing. Let it out. About the head it is allowing yourself to go to the memories. Being alone. It's about not restricting yourself and getting release. It WILL affect your body. It is not about reasoning or rationalizing or thinking it is the exact opposite. Accept it. Shape it accnowledge it. Beat your chest like a gorilla and release the primate. Shout. Make strange noises. and punch walls until your knuckles hurt. It is about release you know? Don't follow what I say as a manual but take the essence out of it.   Not knowing what you have been through I can't go into specifics.  Like.. The tension is there for a reason. It is all connected. You can't just take one part of yourself out of the equation. The trauma is just as much a part of you as your body and mind is and the conflict will always be there if you don't give them all equal right to be.  The pain and physical shit goes away for me after it peaks when I take extreme measures to let my head and body process the feelings without restriction. Like people do drugs, act out, do more violence, to numb that shit because we aren't supposed to accknowledge it's existence and are expected to ""cure"" or remove it. That doesn't happen. We need to accept it. People around us can never understand. We must face it alone. Attacking a single aspect of my problems is just a bandaid and only makes it worse in the long run. It's not a thinking thing or exercise or rationalization thing as people who never lived it would have you think. That's just covering it up. Accept it. Let it be normal. Accept that it is. Work with it. Never ever hide it and specially not from yourself. You need to channel the trauma and not work against it... Don't fight it because it isn't your enemy unless you want it to be."
ptsd,35bdf4,CaptainBludclot,1 point,Fri May 8 21:41:58 2015 UTC,"I hear you. All of this stuff I 100% believe, agree with, want to pursue. But there is just a blockage. A huge blockage. Call it fear, call it lack of permission, call it inability, call it dissociation, call it an advanced freeze response. I am not trying to cure or fix, I want to accept and hold this pain close. I know I can make the mind my friend, I just have a habit of overthinking, so going into the brain seems counter-intuitive.   What brought me to Buddhism was a passage from Thich Nhat Hanh's book Peace is Every Step about non-surgery. Where instead of removing these things, we accept the ""bad"" stuff and hold it close and work with it. I'm just scared to face it. I was never shown how, nor given permission, I am scared of what I will be/who I will be on the other side. Scared of losing control, really scared of losing control.   The times in therapy where I felt the rage rising, and the pain, the past...I have been in a calm state, and then out of nowhere it arises.   I appreciate your insights :)"
ptsd,35bdf4,Sun_will_rise_again,1 point,Fri May 8 21:50:35 2015 UTC,"That fear will never go away if you don't first acknowledge that it is there. You know it is. Are you going to do something about with (some positive rewording) it and use it or are you going to carry it and hide it and let it kill you slowly from inside?  Things get heavier as they grow...  It is about exposure. You obviously already have it figured out. Imo you just need to remove yourself from any expectations because they are only in the way. THEY are the imaginary things.  The permission you are seeking will never come. It is for nobody to give. It is yours to take.  Dissociation is an effective tool but is harder than ANY drug in the world to stop using. I tried almost all of them and could take them or leave them.. the dissociation part took years..  You will never have the permission you are seeking if you don't even permit the trauma or whatever we should call it to flow through you and be free. What with balance in buddhism and whatnot.  Therapy doesn't allow you express it other than with words. At least it never did to me and I have talked to a lot of them. Screw words. Words are social constructs. There is nothing social about what we are going through. If you keep the beast in the cage it will constantly try to escape. Let the beast rage where only you can interact with it and it won't escape in untimely situations or keep picking on you when you have other things to worry about. It will rather help you achieve great things if you accept it as a part of you, because if you let it be your friend. Imagine your trauma as a very powerful creature you are carrying inside you. Your body and mind is the cage where you keep it locked up. It will bite you as an abused animal if you confine it to a cage and treat you as one. It will do everything it can to break both your mind and body.  I appreciate the conversation. I am fighting the same battle and the only real victories I get aren't really from introspection or rationalization. Those are important abilities to have but won't do any good living with this shit. The only thing that helps me is allowing myself way of expressing it. Remember that our words and how people like us are expected to ""cope"" is solely a product of our society and the last centuries of social norms.  We have existed and experienced iincredible things, good and bad and unexplainable for a LOT longer than words or society has been here.   We are animals too.. not just social creatures.  Wording these things to someone who is fighting themselves in the same way as I am less and less and have been for decades is more therapy for me than any session ever over the years.  Babysteps though bro. You don't have to run to the forest and live like a shaman for a weekend. Just next time uncontrollable feelings occur and prevent you from doing anything, remember you are an animal and go punch a tree until the knuckle pain is at the same level as the interior pain. Shout until your throat hurts. Apologize to the friendly tree for making a scene by giving it a hug. It will quietly understand. Enjoy the calmness. Do something equally reatarded next time the urge arises.   When the adrenaline is constantly being triggered without the body being able to utilise it, that is what cause the body discomfort. You aren't supposed to carry these things they are supposed to carry you. See what I did there?  One of my barriers is dancing. One of the healthiest things I could do to let it out is dancing. I just can't. I force myself to do it when I have my solitude back to the primate, fuck reasoning with it mode."

I was shaking and uncontrollable. We take a very somatic approach and try to talk little and feel a lot.   I do like the creature analogy.   Introspection etc. Yea it is a good a-ha! but ultimate it is not the work itself. Trying to figure out how to express it. I write a lot and can get angry, but again...more words...but there is some feeling there with them.   You are right about the body/adrenaline/cortisol. That I know all too well. This energy from a constant fight/flight mode that I can't get out, so it stews or targets other people who don't deserve it (me or my SO or random people).   I'll find a way, I appreciate this.

The first thing that comes to mind is that the sooner I own up to my own emotional outbursts, the sooner the people around me can get past them. Taking responsibility means no one can blame you, because you own it. ""This thing happened, and I acted badly as a result. I didn't feel like I had a choice about my actions, but I understand that they hurt you and I'm sorry. I wouldn't intentionally choose to hurt you."" Hard to stay mad at that for long. The hurt might remain, but the anger seems to dissipate faster that way.   You'll obviously have to be more patient, both in releasing your reactions and in expecting her to get over them. Being treated poorly for any reason by someone you love is going to hurt, and it takes a special kind of person to forgive that hurt over and over. It's important that you give her the opportunity to try... in her own time.  I find that delaying my reactions as much as possible, even if it's only for ten seconds, helps me to make clearer decisions. If I feel like I need to express some strong emotion, I give myself permission to express it... in ten minutes. That way I feel satisfied that my grievance will be heard, and in the meantime I generally calm down a bit and can find some remaining shred of restraint.   And as always with this lovely disorder, forgive yourself as much as you ask anyone else to forgive you. You're going to fuck up, but that's okay. It's not the end of the world. You're not alone and you're not at fault for being imperfect."

I don't even know if there is the time to think about waiting ten minutes between the time I get triggered and the time my mouth starts moving.

You're accessing all these new places and emotions inside you that you've never dealt with before. It's like cracking open a box of sand: a little bit is going to slip out and irritate you.  If possible, I suggest adding couples therapy to your routine. Even just once or twice a month will give you guys an opportunity to talk about how you're effecting each other in a safe environment. I'm willing to bet that your outbursts are triggering something in her, just as she is triggering you.  Therapy will help you two learn how to navigate each other. :)  Good luck!"
ptsd,3591it,waxworm,1 point,Fri May 8 07:59:26 2015 UTC,"I used to feel really awful after panic attacks because my boyfriend would get scared and stop talking to me. It's unfortunate that they are triggered during arguments because I always felt terrible about not being able to work out the problem with him after a certain point!  Eventually, I explained to him that I am not just trying to avoid the argument... the stress just gets to me and sends me to a bad place. That helped a lot and now he doesn't get so upset. I also explained how his distance made me feel more alone and upset and that made them last longer. We worked out a protocol, so that no matter how angry we are with each other or the content of the conversation, we can always take a break to hug and say ""I love you.""  The protocol helps more than I can say! Now if I notice before I really start to panic, we take a quick break to confirm that we still love each other. I still sometimes have panic attacks when we fight, but they are mostly prevented by the break to de-escalate. When I do, he knows that they aren't his fault.

My only suggestion is to start taking action to show her you're sorry and you want to change. It's cliché to say that talk is cheap, and actions speak louder than words, but those clichés are still around because they're true.  Contact your local VA, or your local Vet Center. See if you can get into therapy. Find information for her. See if they offer a group for loved ones of those with Combat - related PTSD.  And if you're eligible for therapy, GO.  Seeing my husband working toward the goal of beating this damned condition is sometimes the only reason I'm able to find the patience I have.

I'm not sure what your therapist's speciality is, but i spent years working with different therapists only to find I couldn't connect with them and didn't want to talk to them about my favorite childhood animal either. :-) I have recently (finally!) figured out I have complex ptsd due to childhood and family of origin issues. It took a really ugly few months of therapy with a therapist who had no business trying to treat my issues to finally find someone who specialized in ptsd. She's been a godsend.   At some point I had a realization (still not always 100% believing it) that maybe the person I am at work and socially really is the REAL person and the person who feels like an imposter is not. I can't tell you that this feels totally true, but it's a different way to look at it.   Mindfulness and staying in the moment might help. I'm not very good at it but this is something that my therapist and I are working hard on. It does help some, although it doesn't solve the issues from the past.   You could try reading ""waking the tiger"" which is one of the first books looking at somatic experiences for ptsd, and a newer one I really found helpful, called ""complex ptsd, from surviving to thriving"" by Peter walker. My therapist actually bought this on my mention of it and said it was very good.   Don't give up. You're not alone and you don't have to be a veteran or major trauma surviver to have ptsd. The small traumas that happen every day over a long period of time are what form complex ptsd."

It's tough, though. Speaking for myself, I wanted people to give a shit about me, but not get too close, if that makes any sense.  If you no kidding think you're up for dealing with everything he's got going on, tell him you'll be there for him, and keep in touch--by which I mean, take the initiative.  If anyone told me they'd be around if I wanted to get in touch, I would assume that they didn't actually want to hear from me, and I would never reach out.  I tend not to reach out to anyone because I've been burned by people who supposedly gave a damn. If you don't think you can be in it for the long haul, don't try and then break it off.    The best I can say is that you've got to be patient, and if he does push you away, remember that his mental health (which sounds quite a lot like my diagnosed PTSD, but don't make assumptions about him, etc.) is NOT your responsibility.  I.e., if he pushes you away to the point where you can't deal with him, that's on him, and not your fault.   To answer one of your questions, no, I don't want any of my friends to go away.  I also don't think I deserve friends, and generally speaking I don't think anyone I know would miss me if I died.  Occasionally people give me reasons to believe otherwise, and that means more than I can say.  That's probably all clear as mud.

In terms of pushing people away... I definitely prefer for people to leave the ball in my court, but it helps to have a reminder/knowledge of it's okay to talk about trauma-related topics with them. So something like ""I'm here for you if you want to talk... even in the middle of the night"" (if that's true) or ""I'm here if you ever want to talk... even if it's about something difficult or weird.""  It seems like overall you are fantastically respectful and supportive. I think that, even though he's having a really difficult time, he's not being very respectful or supportive of you. Given that, it makes the most sense to share resources, let him know that you are happy to talk, and go on with your life.   If he's ready to work on getting better, he will know you are there for him. If he's not then you have to respect his boundaries anyway.

ptsd,354i17,Wikipodiatrist,2,Thu May 7 14:55:03 2015 UTC,Careful how you connect those dots though... It would be essential to know how many had it previous to foster care before referring to those numbers. Most people I know who got placed in foster care had that happen to them for very good reasons. Regardless how bad the foster parents were in some few cases.
ptsd,354i17,CaptainBludclot,3,Thu May 7 16:59:41 2015 UTC,I agree there's more nuance to that figure than my post suggested. The main point is that a chaotic home environment is a risk factor for PTSD.

I was told once that recovery is like a spiral, you may come back around and revisit things (or get walloped) but as you go you're further along in your healing and this new level/rung on the spiral looks different and you're bouncing back quicker, coping better, or maybe have a worse reaction but still learning something, maybe about having a more sensitive season, as it were. I'm sorry to hear what happened to you, but happy to hear the good season you're in--I'm learning to roll w/punches during a good streak myself, so this was timely for me too."

I too push myself incredibly hard to get ahead, and sometimes sacrifice my own mental well-being.   I guess my only advice would be to speak to a therapist if you haven't already. You may need to dive in to the reasons you were in that situation, how you had to cope with it, and how to deal with it now. A big part of therapy is to sort through all of those things that make you feel the way you do.   For me exposure therapy is helpful, but I don't really recommend it unless you are actively seeing a therapist. One thing about having a therapist I enjoyed in the beginning was the homework types of things I'd be assigned before our next session. Most of the time it was some sort of exposure therapy. I made myself feel very vulnerable and scared while in situations I did not want to be in, but ultimately that helped me get over it. I could report back to my therapist about my accomplishments and feel genuinely good about them. Making progress was finally happening.   Good luck and I hope you find the help you need.

When the ghost starts appearing I know that what traumatised me is not happening all over again.    You know this intellectually, but it sounds like you don't know it emotionally yet. You still feel that you're not safe. Your therapist is trying to tell you that you are, but some part of you doesn't believe them.  I was the same way. I had a very strong belief that because I had been abused, it meant that I wasn't (and could never be) safe. I shaped my identity around that belief, and when I got to a point in my recovery where I needed to accept that I'm safe now, I couldn't do it, because I had this maladaptive belief in the way.

Yeah, it's hitting close to home because I have PTSD and have received a huge amount of bullshit for it, for exactly the reasons that you brought up. It ranges from ""that's not really a trigger, you're just too sensitive"" to ""you didn't experience <X> so you can't have PTSD"" to ""your doctor didn't diagnose you correctly"".  I shouldn't have to submit my psychiatric records for public review in order to receive the most basic acknowledgement and consideration of my disability.  I am getting really fucking sick of this constant backbiting and demands to prove the 'legitimacy' of one's disability or other health issues. This isn't limited to mental health, even.  Then there's the fact that finding a good doctor and receiving a correct diagnosis can be very difficult (you ever try to get mental health care without insurance?) I knew I had PTSD before I was 'officially' diagnosed. Some doctors tried to tell me I was bipolar, some tried to tell me that I was just imagining things. I finally did get a correct diagnosis, but it was a tremendous struggle. Mental health care is so fucked up, especially in the USA. Not everyone can afford to go to a psychiatrist, much less have the time/energy/money to find a good one. Putting blame on people for not going through the 'proper' channels and disregarding what they say until they do so reeks of privilege and fetishism for authority & bureaucracy.  Yeah, there are people who make jokes about triggers and mock PTSD. Those people are actually shitty and deserve contempt.  Don't attack people who say they are triggered by something just because you think they don't meet your personal qualifications for having mental health problems.  This sort of crap hurts everyone. PTSD is not a fucking contest. If someone asks you to avoid doing certain things because you're hurting them, just fucking listen and accommodate them instead of launching into interrogations or denying their problems altogether.

Not to make fun of anyone with a serious issue.  Also, you have to imagine that it depends on who speaks up.

I did things that Im not proud of, and did things to other people that Im even less proud of. Ive tried to clean up many times but have never been able to do it.  I can relate to your feeling of why bother. I find myself saying that theres no point in putting in all this effort and time if Im just going to relapse and end up in back where I started. I dont want to reconnect with my family and friends because I worry that if its fair to put them through another relapse, I wonder if its even fair for me to bring new people into my life knowing what I know. To me, Im not fearful of the relapse so much as I expect it to happen. I realize Im living on borrowed time until that day.   My therapist says that I dont have to relapse, that I have control over how this turns out but its happened so many times that I have trouble believing that. I flirt with the idea of just ODing and closing the book of my life. I feel thats how Ill die anyways. Its a struggle every day.   I dont know if I can really give you advice about what to do, because Im not even sure. I know that I go to treatment everyday, I find fulfillment in painting, my dog, and helping out with my Grandmother (she has Alzheimer). When I have good days I take advantage of them, making sure I do everything I can. It helps when the bad days come along, I can look back and say - at least I had a good day.  Its a hard place to be, going through the motions - even though youve given up. I just have a hope that one of these days Ill snap out of it. Im over 2 years clean now, and the prospect of relapse is still something I battle with daily. I hope that as time goes on, my good days will start happening more and I can get comfortable with where Im at.  I hope this helps. . . . Just know that there are people going through similar things :) And that if you keep plugging away at therapy and life youll get through.  For me currently Im going through talk, group, and EMDR therapy. I find that the EMDR is really difficult but Ive found it helpful. I find that Im able to process things differently, and almost work through things that I didnt know how to work through before. Hang in there dude, and were all here if you need to chat."
ptsd,34tuko,Eyebuck,1 point,Mon May 4 19:27:47 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for your reply and sharing your story with me.  It sounds like the circumstances surrounding our troubles are very different but you are feeling a lot of the same things I am.  I'm very curious how you first were diagnosed and some other symptoms we may be sharing.  I am really avoiding creating any kind of relationships with people as well because I keep replaying a specific incident: It was before my mother had been hospitalized for the last time, she was laying in bed and I was with her and she started crying and telling me that she was in so much pain sometimes she just wants to take a bunch of her sleeping pills and not wake up but that wouldn't be fair to my father and I.    I am not really sure about EMDR - I just looked it up and it seems very complicated, I don't really understand but I think I do something similar already.  I often think about how much my mother suffered and often visualize how her face looked right before and right after she died.  Sometimes it is not even on purpose, almost like it just pops up in my head.  Like I said before I am very very new to Reddit so I am unaware if there is any type of messaging system but if you would like I would really like to stay in touch and see how you are moving forward and dealing with these feelings."
ptsd,34tuko,Eyebuck,1 point,Mon May 4 21:19:36 2015 UTC,"That's how this forum works, we all look after each other. This is a safe place I use when I'm feeling down, need to vent or when I'm just looking for advice. Share your feelings and try to relate with others here - it helps me not feel so alone. It also helps me put things in perspective, lots of people feel this way. We're not broken or anything, we're just people trying to make it through life. Hang in there, it does get better.   My symptoms started when I cleaned up. After 3 months of rehab, i started outpatient treatment. I started having trouble sleeping, bad dreams of things I experienced. I spent a lot of time remembering and regretting things that had happened. A lot of guilt for what I put others through. I keep thinking that the things I did in my addiction was what I was. I was capable of stealing, violence and crime. I abused others, and used them for my own purposes. I fear that I'm still capable of those things. My therapist caught what was going on and got me into EMDR.   EMDR seems complicated and a bit hokey at first. I thought it was some new age bullshit, but i started to notice changes. Things got worse for a bit but then I noticed I was sleeping better, not as irritable and actually happy some days. I continued on with my hobbies and got very involved with them - painting made me happy. I still don't sleep every night, im still not working, and 2 years after rehab I'm still in therapy but I'm getting better. It's all about small steps, one at a time. Talk therapy helps as well.  I found EMDR too difficult, we were moving too quickly.  I spoke with my therapist and we started taking breaks. So EMDR every 3 or 4 sessions and talking about the experience in between. The trick is to be honest and build that open relationship with your counsellor.  Hang in there friend, you'll make it :)  P. S.

ptsd,34tuko,rewardiflost,2,Tue May 5 01:20:39 2015 UTC,"Wow.   I'm sorry you have had so many challenges, especially grief.   PTSD, depression, anxiety..   they all happen on a scale, or 'spectrum'.   Most people with these conditions do function pretty well.   We go to work (nearly) every day,  we have relationships, pay our bills, and raise families.       It is only when something serious causes a setback that we hear about it.   The news doesn't report that millions of sick people made it to work today - they talk about the one who committed suicide.     Same for friends and family - we only bring up the depressed or alcoholic uncle when something goes wrong.. not the other 350 days a year.   Don't think that you are less deserving of care because you don't have horrible symptoms.    That could be a sign that you are getting good care, and that you sought out care in time.   As far as fearing suffering- I think we all do. You are in control of some things.  Speak to your doctor or someone in the business office at your usual hospital.   If you can, perhaps a lawyer.   Create healthcare documents for yourself -    you can write down your wishes today, and (depending on where you are.. and how the laws evolve) you can dictate your care.    You can state you don't want to be kept alive through certain means.    You can say that if you even appear to be suffering, you want to be put in hospice care, with pain management.   You can even designate a trusted person (even a lawyer or perhaps a doctor)  to act as your decision maker. It might help you to get these documents together;  you get to think through what you really want (or not), and write it down.   You can file them with doctors, hospitals and others - to make sure your wishes are carried out.  Getting it out of your head, and especially on paper may help.    Filing it legally with your medical providers is doing all you can today to head off the suffering you fear.  You can always amend it later, or designate someone else as your proxy if you change your mind.   Doing all this - the writing down, and filing might be enough to give you some small measure of peace.    You do have some control over this.     You are very young at 23,  and you've had a lot to deal with.   You might get sick.. or you may not.   It could be soon.. or in 40 years.. or never.    Prepare as best you can- file paperwork, and research your family medical history.    Stay in shape and get annual checkups so you have early warnings.   You might find that you meet a special partner.    You might even become a parent.    Other people.. like your Dad today ,  and the possible others in your future .. these people are often a great reason to keep on living.      Similar experiences.. sure.    I've watched my grandparents, parents, and my wife of 20 years all die in front of me.   My little brother has a rare kind of brain cancer, and odds are he has a few years left.      I was waiting to die for a long time.   I see my therapist,  I attend grief counseling,  I take my meds, and I try to keep busy with positive things.    Maybe I'll make a difference in one more life. For now, I'm going through the motions.   It isn't because I'm waiting to die so much...  but I'm waiting to 'wake up' again, and get back to enjoying life.    Today, it isn't great.   Maybe it will be tomorrow.. or in 6 months.     I don't know, but I still have some hope.   As far as meds, some drugs can take weeks to reach 'maximum effect',  and the changes might be very subtle unless you are a trained outsider.    If you want more, or don't like a particular medication - discuss your options with your doctors and pharmacist.      They know this stuff, and they know you.     Good luck.. keep pushing one more tomorrow."
ptsd,34tuko,Pippafert,3,Mon May 4 19:28:23 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for your kind words and sharing your story.    You've been through so much in your life, I really admire that you've kept up hope.  I'm sorry that you're struggling now but it sounds like your future looks bright.  I'm struggling because I always had a small family (I am mixed race so there was a lot of disowning going on) and now I lost 2/3 people that cared for me.  I don't want to make more connections because when I get sick I don't want to be stuck with ties.  My mother was put into hospice and put on so much morphine she couldn't even wake up, and the pain was so bad that she still cried out in her sleep.  Also her condition deteriorated so quickly that it was less a case of being unresponsive but months of pain that wore away at her character until a very painful death.  I have been on Wellbutrin for a little more than a week now and I plan on continuing for at least three more weeks before requesting to switch medicine.  Right now my biggest obstacle is finding the hope that tomorrow will be better and it will all be worth it but hearing your story makes me feel like maybe it is just shock or ptsd and maybe I can get better.    Thank you so much for sharing and reaching out to someone who is struggling."

That doesn't mean it's bad, it just means it does not work the best for you. Please keep trying until you find something that works. From my experience,  it is not going to make you happy but it will give you some energy to deal with the issues you have to face."
ptsd,34tuko,BlueCatIsFat,1 point,Tue May 5 02:50:11 2015 UTC,Wellbutrin is an interesting choice for PTSD. It's an NDRI antidepressant. Any reason why you weren't given an SSRI or a SNRI?
ptsd,34tuko,BlueCatIsFat,2,Mon May 4 19:26:35 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your reply, I'm honestly not sure when my mother first passed my GP gave me something he said was a gentle antidepressant but more of a sleep aid.  Without trying to be too graphic it gave me extreme gastrointestinal distress, so much so it was impossible for me to leave my apartment.  I'm not sure if that is a common side effect he was trying to avoid.    My apologies, I am very ignorant about mental health this is my first time experiencing anything like this and it is very daunting."
ptsd,34tuko,Pippafert,2,Mon May 4 20:46:33 2015 UTC,"You don't have to apologize. Most people don't know the difference between NDRIs, SSRIs, SNRIs, etc. They're all antidepressants, but they affect different brain chemicals (norepinephrine, dopamine, seretonin).  Wellbutrin causes some people to become irritable, and many doctors avoid it for people with anxiety. Since PTSD is associated with anxiety, irritability and rage, it was just surprising to me. Some people have no problem with Wellbutrin, though.  I was just curious. Sorry if I made things any more complicated, especially since medically related things are a trigger for you. If you're not feeling like the Wellbutrin is helping, perhaps you could talk to your doctor about an antidepressant that focuses on Seretonin, and see what they have to say about it.  For me, when it comes to medical things, when I feel like I understand how things work, I feel less anxious about it. Perhaps if you had a dialogue with your doctor about the different kinds of antidepressants, maybe you'd feel more in control and less afraid?  Just an idea. I wish you well :)"
ptsd,34roja,buartha,3,Sun May 3 23:53:26 2015 UTC,Think of your scars as medals you won fighting in the war of your previous life. They are just proof of your awesomeness.
ptsd,34roja,CaptainBludclot,2,Mon May 4 06:58:21 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say it like this, 'cause it's not really a medal that you want to earn, but I do see my scars as something that reminds me of a certain period in my life. Maybe it's different for us, because my scars are made by myself by selfharm, so it doesn't remind me of overpowerment by someone else.  Don't know how to put this in words correctly, but for me it feels a bit empowering to see my scars, because in a way they help me to take back that part of my life. I've always felt that my life was lived by me until I got depressed and then I skipped some years/ I was not conciously there and after the depression I was 'back' to live life. My scars help me to remind me to have respect for the person I was in that intermediate time and to reprocess the things that happened in those years. I'm now feeling safer, I'm more healed and secure, so the way I feel about the things that happened in those years is very different from how I felt at that time about them. I don't like my scars and sure, I'm also in a way embarrassed by them, but this is who I am, this has been part of my life and I may acknowledge that as much as I may acknowledge other times that were more society-approved. When I see them I feel sad for myself, for that I had to experience those harsh things, but I also feel the power I have, since I've come a long way and did most of it by myself.  And if you feel the need to cover them up, then do so. Not because you need to cover them up for others, but because you are not required to show other people what you don't want to show. For me Savlon helped somewhat.  Also, don't be afraid that this is a backslide. The thought ""O, no, I may be backsliding again"" is more likely to cause exactly that than what you feel about your scars right now, I think. I think it's a part of a natural healing process to not wanting to be reminded of your past and feeling marked. I've been there too and sometimes I still am, but the periods I feel that way become less frequent and less long. You probably are going through this now, because somehow you've managed to make the space in your life and trauma really fills up that space to be processed. For example: when I finally had a secure relationship memories and feelings that I had suppressed for many years just flushed over me. It's a sign that you are now safe enough, strong enough to process this.  Try to be kind to yourself. Try to give yourself what you need to feel good. Some days this will be to cover your scars under a longsleeved hoodie, other days it will be to sit in the sun with naked arm and feel the warmth on your skin.   A meme on reddit helps me some in situations like this: ""If life gets harder, it must be because you just leveled up"".  Good luck!"

I feel super vulnerable every time I wear bathing suit or am naked with anyone. People ALWAYS ask about them.  For me, time has helped them to fade, but I am still really insecure about them. I even avoid swimming all together. But time has helped me get more comfortable. Also knowing that I can tell someone I don't want to talk about something. Like if someone asks me about my scars I can just say I don't want to talk about it.  Sorry my friend. Good luck."
ptsd,34oxxs,randy_buttcheese,9,Sun May 3 05:18:12 2015 UTC,"As someone who suffers with C-PTSD, my understanding is that those with C-PTSD suffer from a warped sense of self due to their trauma, whether that presents as an identity crisis, psychosis, borderline traits, or dissociative tendencies. I concur with angelbreaker in the sense that it's more common for long-term, systematic abuse to result in C-PTSD, but long-term trauma can warrant PTSD alone. C-PTSD is presented when there's a dissociative element and a warped sense of self/autonomy/identity. It's reminiscent of brainwashing and often hallmarked by the inability to create a consistent trauma narrative.   source: DSM-5"

I randomly get those triggers still but now I'm mindfully of why it's happening and attempt to remove myself from the situation that's provoking those emotions. Most times, it's just thoughts or ideas that don't serve me. The real challenge for me is dealing with those emotions cause by a someone else that's in front of me. ."

I experience de-escalation of symptoms during our sessions, and I think that I've gotten some distress tolerance benefits in the long term (he points out improvements pretty often, but of course it's much harder for me to be objective about it). The improvements have not been dramatic, but I also have some extenuating circumstances (thanks, addiction) on top of my developmental trauma -- I do find that it is beneficial, but if you have co-occurring issues like me you might not see as much benefit as someone who ""only"" has PTSD."
ptsd,34pa0n,m3m0r14,2,Tue May 5 20:39:44 2015 UTC,"I have been going to a therapist who uses this approach. I would say a couple things in the comments were familiar so far: I had to miss a couple weeks in a row and felt really stressed and I think it's helping, but is hard for me to be sure most of the time. I think it's hard for me to gauge progress because I am so, so out of touch w/ my physical feelings. Anyway, my responses seem to be a lot of ""freeze"" type ones. Just becoming aware that I was so unaware was a big deal for me. It depressed me a lot to realize I wasn't living in my body really, but now I am getting past the shock of how removed I was (am still) from my senses. At an appt. I can describe where I feel something now when I bring up a traumatic event, but don't have the ability to really feel it on my own when I feel anxious. Ugh rambling...because even the subject makes me feel unsure of myself, like I'm trying to describe something I have very little knowledge about like calculus or physics...except it's my own physical sensations...sheesh :/"
ptsd,34pa0n,m3m0r14,2,Thu May 7 01:33:37 2015 UTC,"I know what you mean. When my therapist asks me to check in and tell him what I'm noticing about my body, I am at a loss.  I get the feeling that I'm missing out on a lot.  I have gotten better, but it's weird how out of touch I am with then tension and weight I carry with me all the time.  I think I am a freeze type too. I appreciate that you're sharing, so I don't feel like you were rambling at all.  It's nice to hear that someone else is having the same experiences I am. It's helpful to pay attention to my physical responses because they are harder to dismiss than thoughts.  They kind of validate what my mind has been denying all these years.  It's been interesting.

It was honestly so surprising that I was panicked and overwhelmed for a minute. She said I had released some stored trauma. I felt fine afterward and I still don't know what to make of it. I hadn't been talking about anything particular beforehand. We usually just talk btw, this wasn't representative of a normal weekly session. It was an interesting occurrence I thought I'd share."

Emotionally this is similar to being assaulted.  Your body needs to know you are here and now not in the past.  Every hour or two stop moving. Slip off your shoes and feel the ground beneath you. Close your eyes and think of something you are looking forward to-lunch with friends, a laugh at practice, your boyfriend's smile. Breathe a few deep breaths then get on with what comes next.   Be sure you have healthy comforts easily available too. A good blanket, those jammies, a popsicle from the fridge. It's ok to need extra comfort through this.

It hurts, it's painful and it feels overwhelming. All I can say is that retreating back to how things were before will not solve anything.

Let him know (again) that he didn't do anything wrong, it was something that, under different circumstances, would have been fine. If you are comfortable talking about what had happened to you, then give him the option of knowing.  What I said to my boyfriend was, ""Look, some pretty horrible things happened to me.  Unless it will make it easier for you to understand I really don't need to share details.  Just know I was molested and I'm still trying to get past it.""  My boyfriend declined to know any details.  He said that just knowing that someone hurt me drove him crazy and that I could share what I wanted but he'd not ask for information I didn't offer. If you aren't comfortable talking about what happened, give a broad reference and leave it at that.  Let him know that it makes you uncomfortable to talk about it so you don't want to share details but  you were [[ insert issue ]]. BEFORE any more intimacy, talk about what might bother you- a phrase or a position or whatever.  Let him know that by not doing these actions you'll feel significantly safer and you'll BOTH be happier while intimate (and just in general, hopefully). Lastly, as far as him thinking you're crazy or that he'll have to take care of you: be honest with him.  Assuming you want more than just casual sex the truth is always better, as it will probably find its way out anyway.  So let him know, 'I go to therapy, and sometimes have issues like the other night, but it's not often' or 'I have trouble with _____ but other than that I'm okay'  whatever your status is.   I hope this helps.  I know it was hard for me to explain some parts of my issues to my boyfriend, but after we talked about what did or didn't bother me things were much better."

You're not alone in this sort of behavior either. I was triggered once while engaging in a sexual act and my mind totally left my body, I tried to go through the motions for another minute, but it was like I wasn't in my body anymore. My husband said I even looked vacant. So I stopped and said I had to go to the bathroom. I came back, still staring vacantly off into space while my husband was asking me if I was okay.

Sometimes I will try if I feel brave, and my SO appreciates the effort. SO rarely pushes boundaries, but only if I give the ok.  I don't think about sex at all for prolonged periods, and therefore never approach my SO. SO always approaches me and if I don't feel into sex I always try to help him out other ways. I try my best to kiss and cuddle, give massages, stop what I am doing and giving undivided attention when SO talks about their day or needs to vent.   I am also currently in therapy to help me get over my trauma that surrounds my intimacy issues. I don't know how long it will take to get to the ""recovered"" part but trying my best and facing my trauma is the only way that it will get better in the end, even if it means getting worse right now for a bit. My SO recognizes my efforts and because of this has more hope and patience. We didn't get here without it getting to rock bottom first. We almost separated and split, but I realized I had a lot of work to do, and so did SO, and together we are continuing to rebuild after crumbling, but this time after 10 years, we will have a much stronger foundation to build upon with our experiences."
ptsd,34lrfz,Wattsherfayce,2,Sat May 2 16:08:02 2015 UTC,"I just want to encourage you, you are doing the right thing by facing your trauma and dealing with it head on. I have been married almost 25 years to an incredibly patient man and I really didn't even see how bad our intimacy was because my best friend was also a survivor of sexual trauma as a child. So, it seemed normal to me. It got as bad as only having sex a few times a year. My poor husband stuck by me through it all. I don't know how he did it. I have been in therapy for a year and a half and in that time also had an emotional affair. I had told my parents about my abuse at the hands of my older brother and that began a really traumatic time for me. My husband was busy falling apart himself so I felt like I had no support and turned to the wrong person for that support. All over email but a past love/friend. Somehow, we've turned it around, we went to marriage counseling and I started bioidentical hormones (I wasn't producing progesterone or testosterone). The therapy and getting my hormones straightened out helped our intimacy so much. We are slipping again in our intimacy but it has been because of me. I again have no desire but we couldn't afford my hormones. I hope we can again soon.  So as someone who truly understands the difficulties you have experienced with intimacy and why, I just want to let you know that you can do it. As my therapist says, it isn't a sprint. We can take the time I (& you) need to face our issues and heal. Having a supportive & patient partner makes it that much easier. Keep going with therapy but I also suggest looking into having your hormone levels checked (preferably by someone who does bioidentical hormones--they are compounded for exactly what your body needs) and to make sure other health issues are not an issue for your intimacy. For me, and I held onto my secret abuse for far far too many years, it wasn't good for my health to not deal with my trauma. I have multiple autoimmune diseases and other health issues. Get a thorough check up and make sure you don't have unknown health issues because that leads to more lack of desire. The testosterone for me was huge in changing our sex life. For you, it may be a different thing or therapy will be enough. I truly hope that is the case for you. It is the hardest thing I have ever done but I think it is so great that you are facing your trauma as well!! Good for you and keep it up! I know it is hard and awful to face it but it is such a relief for me to have it not be a huge secret. My husband knew, of course. I had to tell him shortly after we got married because I truly had no idea how much it would affect our intimacy until then because we were in a very religious phase when we met and married. Now we are happy agnostics and honestly, that has freed me up as well. Sorry this is so long. Just keep it up and I am so happy you are dealing with this now rather than in fifteen more years. You have saved yourself a lot more grief! Good for you!! I wish I had the strength to deal with it earlier. I will be in therapy for quite awhile, I think but I am okay with that, I have an amazing therapist. We are going to start EMDR when I am ready. If you haven't yet, check out Pandys.org. When you sign up you can access threads that have people with similar traumas that can provide support. There is a subreddit of it as well but not as active as the site itself. Good luck on your journey and peace to you. (((hugs))) again, sorry this is so long."

I suffer from chronic pain from osteoarthritis and fibromyalgia from multiple MVAs, and I am also bipolar. So most of my medications are known to mess with one's libido, however we both agree that when I'm relatively stable and my mood disorder and pain conditions are managed it's easier to get into intimacy.   It took me a while to get into therapy. Right now we are exploring slow exposure therapy couple with mindfulness. I'm glad I finally got into it as I'm honestly sick of being held hostage by my fears. 14 years of holding it in did me no good. It just made everything worse.

My husband sees a therapist that is into mindfulness and meditation. I am still working in coping skills because my body freaks out on me if I have to see a member of my family. I get migraines at the thought of seeing my younger brother because he went no contact with me after I told the family I never wanted to see my older brother again. We've been in touch sporadically but only if I initiate and then I freak out internally because he won't talk about it with me. My parents won't either. It is the elephant in the room. Always. My husband, sons, nephew (son of my abuser--that says a lot) all fully support me as well as some extended family and good friends. It might have been easier if my parents hadn't questioned everything & everyone of my sanity for months instead of giving me support. We are starting to get past it. They are in their 70s & some days I feel so guilty that I told them. But I had to. To survive. So did you. Peace and healing from me to you."

I understand, I would feel the same way. I have an acquaintance that has severe burn scars on his face and body (I assume) and he is married to a beautiful and amazing woman with three kids. I hardly notice his scars because he isn't conscious of them himself. If you feel up to it, I think seeing a therapist couldn't hurt. Sometimes you have to try a few to find one you click with, but don't give up. Good luck and I hope you can find the strength to deal with it. Maybe you need to be with a partner who you can talk to about your insecurity from the scars before you are intimate & if you can't or that person is weirded out, then they are not the one for you. I am sure some great person will not be freaked out by the scars. Developing an 'I give no fucks' attitude could help. I know, easier said than done. Good luck!!"

So, in addition to having C-PTSD I'm in early addiction recovery, which my therapist is always reminding me is a disease of intimacy first and foremost. I'm married, and have been with my husband for 10 years total at this point. We're both survivors of child abuse, and we've both developed different ways of coping with that trauma (as well as plenty of misunderstandings that arise because of those maladaptive defense mechanisms).  The biggest thing I have learned this far into my recovery is that I have no idea what healthy intimacy looks like. Every intimate relationship I witnessed growing up was terribly dysfunctional if not outright abusive, so a huge challenge for me is discovering just what is and is not healthy. I've been hesitant about fully committing to a 12-step program so far, but hearing the stories of other abuse survivors in meetings and how they have been able to move past the destructive cycles of trauma repetition has gone a long way toward convincing me of its value."
ptsd,34lnpo,DocWhirlyBird,4,Sat May 2 06:48:13 2015 UTC,"I'm not a vet. I have PTSD. For a long time I was in denial because, ""it's not like I'm a war veteran or something!"" I'd think about movies like Saving Private Ryan and for years I ignored the signs. After diagnosis, I still struggle with talking about my PTSD for fear people will think I'm just a poser. People respect vets. People know what vets go through (or we think we do) and PTSD is becoming more and more visible regarding vets (which is important!) But this month is NAMI's mental health awareness month, so I'm doing my best to talk about my PTSD  with people in my real life who know me.  There are some vets who have faced horrors far worse than me, but there are some who have faced far less. The same is also true for non-combat PTSD. Also, the level of trauma is subjective, and how deeply each person is affected by varying levels of trauma depends on each unique person -- and has absolutely nothing to do with how ""tough"" they are.  It's not a competition. Your trauma and your PTSD is valid. For all you know, your mental anguish might be even stronger than someone who faced something you subjectively view as ""worse.""  Any time you feel like invalidating yourself because what you went through ""wasn't that bad"" I give you permission to think about the woman on reddit whose PTSD is really, really crippling her and she never even faced actual military combat. Not even once.   Compare yourself to me instead of them - in your mind - it's ok with me (because I am coming to accept that my trauma was very, very, very bad so I am feeling a lot less insecure & invalidating of myself.)

ptsd,34lnpo,BlueCatIsFat,2,Sat May 2 07:23:35 2015 UTC,"Hi DocWhirlyBird.  I came here looking to kill some time and I saw your post.  I am killing time because my husband is a combat vet and he recently had an episode that landed him in a treatment facility.  He is there now and I can't talk to him for another two hours.  I saw your post and I cried inside for you.    First, I think you should know I am a social worker - I am educated in War Trauma.  And you know what, that doesn't mean much of anything.  I seem to do all the wrong things when it comes to my husband sometimes.  Do you know why?  Because it is different for everyone.  I can attend class after class, and sometimes something will happen with him that I would have never expected.  Sometimes he flashes back to extreme trauma, sometimes to something benign.  He doesn't know why and he can't control it.  It isn't the level of the traumatic experience that causes these feelings - it is how you reacted to the experience that is stuck with you.  When you wrote that you used to see flares to warn of incoming attacks, I didn't think to myself ""that isn't so bad.""  I thought to myself, holy shit, this guy had to deal with knowing he was in danger, knowing that these signals meant he could blow up at any moment, and he thinks he doesn't deserve to have a flashback about them?  I get that even those flares probably became routine for you - you probably saw them more often as time went on and you probably didn't get too excited about every single signal.  It's probably confusing as all hell - while you were over there you probably stopped reacting strongly to those signals, so why react so strongly now?  My husband once told me that he eventually got to the point that when the warning was put out and he was sleeping, he would roll over, pull his flack vest over his body, and go right back to sleep.  Did that mean the threat wasn't real?  No, it just meant he was so used to that level of anxiety that it didn't feel like a big deal at the time.    But now, you aren't at that level of anxiety.  You are home, you are safe, and you don't expect to get blown up.  You don't expect to see a flare telling you to take cover.  When you did see that signal (or at least what your brain perceived as a signal) you went from happy at home to in a war-zone in less time than it takes to blink.  That is trauma.  That is real.  That is intense.  Your poor body and brain had to asses the thread and put you into you on high alert all to save your life.  I can't imagine the physical reaction you must have had, let alone the emotional one.    So anyway, I don't know what I am getting at really.  I know it doesn't mean much from random internet lady, but you have my permission to feel traumatized. You have my permission to cry.  You have my permission to feel bad for yourself.    If you ever want help - if you ever want to talk - call the VA.  Sure, you don't have a PTSD diagnosis or a documented disability, but they can connect you with people who can help.  Hell, just the act of going overseas, leaving your loved ones and your home, is a traumatic experience.  You went to a war zone for Christ sake!  That shit is intense!    Good luck.  Thank you for going over there - thank you for serving, and I hope you feel better."

So for now, my theory is to just keep doing the ""right things"" (which are largely uncomfortable) to see how much further the symptoms will abate.

I think therapy has made the severe thoughts go away mostly, due to working out why my brain is doing what it's doing. (and talking about those things.) But all the other, smaller thoughts can be difficult to know why I still have them. Does this ever go away? Will I ever be rid of this stupid problem?   I think staying in therapy is very important. But I think having to ""just ask"", as your therapist says, isn't exactly the solution. I'm sure it helps in the moment, but if you are still having those thoughts, then just asking every time won't do you any good. Stopping yourself in the moment, and understanding why you think the things you do and try to either apply logic (if possible), or let it go has always helped me. In severe situations I can't do either, and that is very difficult. But the focus should be on yourself I think. Some people probably don't mind answering your question, but you depending on an answer can't be good in the long run. What are your thoughts?  Stay positive, friend.

Because he doesn't really know. He knows that he had an urge to do this horrible thing, and he acted on it. Beyond that, he couldn't tell me why, any more than I could tell you why I chose what I ate for breakfast.   What has given me closure is recognizing that it's over and in the past, and he's not going to hurt me like that again. Once I could feel the truth in that statement, I could let go of so much of the fear and anger and shame, and begin to forgive (him, myself, everyone around me that didn't believe me or protect me). And that, finally, has allowed me to start to get over it."
ptsd,34hkoq,Digiopian,3,Fri May 1 15:12:40 2015 UTC,Have you met with other victims of his? This was very powerful for me.   I also advocated for children as a volunteer for many years.  It fed my heart with hope and helped my healing in a big way.
ptsd,34hkoq,mydaddyisadrunkass,3,Fri May 1 15:05:42 2015 UTC,"Do you need too know his motivations? Must closure come from confronting him? Can you create closure for that event yourself?   I've confronted a number of people that have abused me. They can no more tell me why; then they can take back what they did to me. I suspect for then this is more a matter of self perception and learned behaviors then a case of nature based off my. various unpleasant placements.  I'm not saying purple cannot explain their abusive behaviors. Rather, in my experience these confrontations never go as planned. They always leave me worse off. I attribute this in part to my and their age.  Also, the conditions we've been raised in didn't contribute to introspection, humility, or any meaningful understanding of restitution. Given time I've been able to take some closure knowing that some of these people will not hurt me again. This Is hardly satisfying, but Its a better mental place for me to be now than where i was. This is where I'm at.   Maybe I've said something you can glean insight from? Maybe I'm completely incoherent. I can't tell the difference anymore."
ptsd,34hkoq,PM_ME_NICE_THOUGHTS,3,Fri May 1 08:48:15 2015 UTC,"Confronting those who hurt me didn't give me any closure either. I wanted an apology. I wanted remorse. I wanted to know why. What happened was that they used that opportunity to deny that it even happened and to manipulate me further. Those who hurt me simply do not care, or if they do, they will not admit it. In the end, talking to them made me question whether or not the trauma even happened. It re-traumatized me and drove the trauma deeper.   Those who hurt you cannot give meaning to the trauma, only you can give meaning to it by taking control of your healing. I am in the beginning stages of recovery, so I still struggle with trying to force meaning onto my trauma. Please know (and this is something I need to remind myself of often) that you cannot make meaning in the trauma, but through recovery you will create meaning coming out of the trauma."
ptsd,34hkoq,cyanoside,1 point,Fri May 1 18:21:11 2015 UTC,"It will be hard, but you will have to (through years of therapy) give yourself What YOU need.  Having closure would sure help you fill part of that in, but it doesn't fix things. Also, the why doesn't necessarily give you the closure you need.  For me, I thought I Wanted it..M But It What I found was highly traumatic and nearly destroyed me.   For me, I thought I knew how things were. Horribly abused mentally,  physically, verbally my entire childhood. My sister and I always joked she was like Dr. JEKYL and Hyde, but didn't take it seriously.  She'd abuse me, then later accuse me of lying or over-reacting.  She rarely abused us in the presence of others The way I dealt. .. I told myself at least SHE had to live with what she did, knowing she was horrible,  and a lisr, and I was good.  Then last year I got my Why.   And it nearly destroyed me.My father,  who oddly enough is a psychiatrist. Always believed her and thought we were just exaggerating or making things up.  My sister is living with them, and since semi-retirement he is actually around.. and he finally actually saw her (abusing my adult sister).  And he brought something up, and it slammed us like a ton of bricks. Because It was so OBVIOUS in hindsight.   And having seen another professional for a short time... she almost definitely has (covert) DisassociatIve Identity Dosorder, with a few full personsalities.  Her abuser / introject is her sbuser.  There are a few others that are so different from each other it is a huge duh in hindsight (ie super capable vs. Childlike and helpless, etc).  Finding this why out, thoufh, nearly destroyed me.  Because what I had believed my whole life to survive... that at LEAST  she had to live with herself, was false.  Her host personality really and truly never did know what her abuser introject did to us.  Do not only were we abused our whole childhoods... the person who did it to us didn't even have to live with the knowledge of what they did!!!!  Sorry for the long spiel.  Basically, it is a point that be careful of what you wish for in high stakes like thIs. if it doesnt turn out like you thought or if something you never expected happens in a bad way. . It can br VERY traumatic.  I am truly sorry you don't have the chance to get your why. .. but trust me, from my first hand experience. .. unless you are strong enough to handle disappointments and completely unexpected. .. it could be incredibly traumatic.   It has taken me over a year to just get back to where I was before, as my whole basis of self and coping was shaken.  Have you looked into DBT?  It is the only thing that has EVER helped me, and now I know why (having been diagnosed the last 2 years)  It WAS OriginalLy Designed For Just bordelines... But THE Found It helps MANY Other things,  Including Just ptsd. It Takes at least A year but It CAN Really help...  You will need to look into yourself and work with your therapist to create your own strength and identity and self-support. Hard and long eork, but it is possible."

We have thicker skins than a lot of people. We're sometimes desensitized to it all, numb, and we forget that there are normal, every day problems. Listen to your friend vent about her boyfriend. Cook a meal for yourself and a friend who's been having a bad day. Make cookies for someone. Listen   This is encouraging to hear. Thanks for saying this. Sometimes I feel like I am the basket case and my help and contribution isn't important. I feel very small. Thanks for reminding me that I am not. It's true that we can be very stoic after surviving abuse (I definitely am).  Thanks for sharing. This is really encouraging to you. You are an extremely courageous woman to get through this. I am sure you have prevented other women's suffering and set a legal and social precedent by doing something to stop this. Your mentioning cutting and you emotional turmoil strongly reiterated the point to me that we should not judge people who are having these problems as is often the default reaction in our society without knowing the story behind it. It may in fact be a mark of strength, a battle scar in a way that shows that you actually courageously managed to survive something horrible. You did not choose to go through what you did but you definitely took action at helping to fix the world."

That knowledge could save not only a lot of people, but also a lot of animals that have to be given up to shelters! You could do a lot of good in the world by telling your story not just to folks with mental illness, but also to animal lovers, animal rescue folks, etc, especially if you started a movement & inspired people to create platforms where people could learn about the process, what it costs, what the laws are in their state, etc. There could be advocacy to have renters be required to be told their rights. Shelters all over could have informational fliers. It's limitless. Thank you for sharing and big hugs to you!"

I became a filmmaker because movies were my escape when I was a kid and I wanted to create worlds for other people like me - but also tell my story. My BIGGEST goal? Changing the way we educate people about child abuse. Mostly, I hear ""know the signs"" and shit, but how often do you see posts targeted towards people who have sexual attractions to animals or children? These people need to know they're not monsters for having urges they can't control, they're not perverts - what they CAN control is NOT DOING IT. There are support groups, therapists, psychiatrists, literally any kind of resource you would need, but it's never talked about. As long as they make the choice not to act on those urges and not hurt a child, then I think they're a wonderful person. They've prevented child abuse. They're starting to go this route with rape culture and educating MEN to prevent it, but it needs to be extended.   As for animals and ESA stuff, I always wanted to be a vet until I was like 16, so animals are a soft spot for me and always will be. I truly, deeply, passionately care about the healing power of animals and how amazing that bond can be."

ptsd,34f6q3,wutwutdodoiisay,1 point,Thu Apr 30 17:15:57 2015 UTC,"This is going to sound like a strange recommendation but try reading a book called Boundaries by Dr.Cloud. It was extremely useful not just in the dating department but with all my relationships. (Diagnosed 26 am now 31, in relationship 2 & 1/2 yrs) the book is also religious based but you can always skip the religious context if you want. I did. Also I took a 2 yr hiatus from dating to work of finding out more about me and learning to accept who I am. Try dating around, not striving for a serious relationship or sexual ones. Continue therapy. Make new friends. Remember all people struggle with relationships. The important thing is to be gentle with yourself."
ptsd,34f6q3,fadingdimlite,1 point,Thu Apr 30 18:06:41 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I'll order the book -- also probably a great idea for me to reframe my ""refusal to date"" as a ""hiatus to accept myself."" Can I ask what that entailed? Just not actively seeking out a romantic relationship, but what if you met someone who was interested in dating you? What did you say to them? Or are you saying that you just dated very casually, but didn't let things progress to a more serious level?  I just was broken up with about a month ago and he did everything in an honest, nice way (for the most part). He offered to be my friend in a genuine, caring way. Yet I still completely lashed out at him, said all these paranoid, irrational things -- that of course only lead to later embarrassment. I apologized and tried to explain. I ended up blocking him to keep MYSELF from saying anything else hurtful.  How do you remain gentle with yourself when you know you've said hurtful things to someone else? I mean, one can only apologize so many times.  I can congratulate myself for moments when I show restraint or have realizations; but I really don't feel like I can be rational in times where I feel ""abandoned.""   Sorry for long post."

""What I learned from pressing charges against my father."" I delve into relationships and this EXACT problem I have always had. When you live in that kind of environment, you didn't learn boundaries and how to maintain a healthy relationship. I realized literally 2 months ago that I have never actually had what most people would consider a healthy relationship, and I am ALWAYS terrified of abandonment. I thoroughly believe it's not a matter of who, it's a matter of WHEN. Love and dating is a lot like high school popularity - the harder you try, the more obvious it is, and the more you're actually pushing people away and making it worse. If you try to keep a bird locked in your hands, it will inevitably panic and try to find a way out, but if you keep your hand open and just be patient, it may fly around the room for a while, but then it might come and land right in your hand. You have lessons to learn before the universe will give this to you. And again, please go read my post, I have more to say there.  Sending you love."
ptsd,34f6q3,mydaddyisadrunkass,1 point,Thu Apr 30 23:17:51 2015 UTC,"""You have to keep trying"" is a not-truth. I will assume she meant well and means it is important for the psyche not to give up hope completely. And that is true. But it is also true that you can try anything you want when it comes to dating and relationships and that includes periods of celibacy.  Abstinence/ celibacy happened to be one part of my sexuality that I had not explored the first time I wanted to avoid dating like the plague. I also did not want to be indefinitely locked into avoidance or slip into pessimism completely. So I set three simple, important, and personal things that had to happen if I was to consider dating someone.   For instance, I hate the smell of alcohol during sex, so one of the things was no drunks (some holidays excluded lol). I was shocked how long it took for that one to fall into place, but everytime I bent the rule it sucked for me. And the wait was worth it.  It's ok to focus on yourself and not date for a while, just don't lose hope.   And for what it's worth, it's a hook up culture still at your age. Love is rare and you deserve that. I would bet you have a much longer relationship eventually."

I would have just focused on building friendships and a support system, rather than on romantic relationships.  It's easier said than done, because even those platonic relationships are hard to build if you have trust and dependency issues as I did. I don't think it's about meeting the right person.

She has been one of the most resilient and understanding humans in my life.  My issues since being back stateside are a novel in itself, but she has in my mind suffered through me.  Not to the point where I'd bring harm on her physically, but the whole process of seeing me cope and all.  I didn't seek help until a few years after we've been married.  One of the things that made me get some help was my mother saying that I've changed.  She usually doesn't comment on anything unless she feels the need to and that hit home for me.    To answer your question, I'm very open with my wife, down to the T.  I need her to keep me in line, she is always there to advise me through all obstacles I encounter as I reintegrate back into a normal environment.  It is one of the things I'm grateful for.  To those that don't have a significant other or don't trust theirs I'd advise calling up an old battle buddy and talking with them.  You never know if they may be encountering the same scenarios as well, sometimes men/women with PTSD prefer to speak to someone that experienced the same events as them.

Sometimes I try to push past her boundaries, and she lets me in, and I am able to help her in some way, other times it's just upsetting for her, but there's going to be conflict in a relationship, whether it includes PTSD or not. However, my partner has NEVER told me her illness was none of my business. It's entirely my business. I live with her and help take care of her when she's unable to take care of herself. Understanding how she's feeling and what she goes through helps me remember to speak softly when she's stressed out, give her space when she's feeling overwhelmed, and take on responsibilities that are normally hers when she has a bout of depression.  Those with a mental illness will at times be betrayed by their minds. That's what mental illness is. That doesn't mean we as their partners should be dismissive of their feelings or opinions, but it does mean we need to stick to our guns if we think they're doing something unhealthy. We need to keep making a case for what we believe will be helpful, and we have a right to what we need to stay healthy, strong, and emotionally stable, so that we can continue to be good supports for our partners."

Consider going to therapy for yourself. Your needs matter, too. If he asks why you're going, don't make it ""his fault"" but explain that you realize you've been focusing too much on fixing him, so you're going to back off a little bit and worry about yourself. Tell him you still love him & support him, and say this warmly, with confidence, reassurance and a smile.  It is quite possible that he may realize that therapy isn't some kind of punishment or judgment. You'll be setting an example & perhaps even make it seem less intimidating.   Or not. He may go, or he may not. You can't go to therapy with the ulterior motive of psyching him into going. Go for yourself. You do need it, because you need support. Whether he goes or not, something good will come of it and it will also help you keep the balance so that too much of your mental/emotional energy isn't unbalanced toward his needs.

It is more effective than other therapy I have received because it focuses more on physical symptoms of trauma -- of which I have many (muscle tension, anxiety, heart palpitations, headaches, startle response, nervous habits, etc.) Other therapy was cognitively-based and focused too much on talk. With somatic experiencing, I am learning to pay attention to how my body's fight/flight response was repressed during trauma.

Though, I'd say: just because you don't have a career or a defined purpose doesn't make you a loser. We're definitely socialized to think that, but that isn't the only way to look at things. It's great to help people and, hypothetically, everyone should try to contribute to society. But it's ok if you aren't doing that right now. It doesn't mean you should enjoy your life any less. Enjoy it more, actually. I remember reading about gentlemen in the old days who would have solitary holidays where they would just go into nature for a year or so, or travel to places where they didn't know anyone. That aimlessness is just a part of life and I don't think it's selfish. The world isn't going anywhere. I think it's ok to take the time to be patient with yourself.   Most of my favorite things have nothing to do with ambition anyway: (Hobbits, poetry, pizza, forests, solitude, coffee, books, hugs, wind rushing over my face, walking the streets of an unfamiliar city, cats sleeping in sunlight, loving people)."
ptsd,346m2a,BradburyBunny,2,Thu Apr 30 20:12:02 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the encouragement. I like your list.  I like forests too. And coffee and books and hugs and cats in the sunlight and loving people.  I'm realizing I am having to think hard about my own unique list...  I like kisses, hot tea, sunshine on a perfect 72 degree day, hot showers and baths, clean air, mountains, massages, feeling rested, making someone happy when they're feeling down, singing (badly) to catchy uplifting songs, flowers, wine, clear blue skies, movies, clean laundry, the color blue, dark chocolate, wind chimes, my children, the smell of BBQ...  Wow, I guess I like a lot of things. I had to stop myself once I got on a roll there.  Thank you so much. That was really meaningful for me."

It's really overwhelming to think about going through this cycle repeatedly for the rest of my life   yeah. that part really bites. I had one therapist tell me to think of it like a spiral, where you're getting further and further out and away from the center of horribleness, even though sometimes it seems like you're just going in circles. recovery is the process of making peace with it, over and over again, perhaps with different parts of it as we grow older and different life experiences ""activate"" different parts of our wounds.  it's good you're doing great though. it's okay to be doing great and still need some help"

ptsd,344oy1,bodhibell02,1 point,Tue Apr 28 17:18:11 2015 UTC,"TBH I'm not 100% sure what it was. I haven't been to therapy in about 6 months. I kind of gave up and cost was a big issue for me. For the thinking and anxiety I think try to keep myself busy has really helped. Doing things I enjoy, like cooking, and exercising tends to help me keep my mind off things. My SO has recently introduced me to WoW... so I see a lot of time being spent on that! In saying that, it took a bit to get motivated to get back into doing things that I've enjoyed.   In terms of the hypervigilance. I don't know. A lot of it was that I was too scared to sleep because of the nightmares. Being distracted has helped with that as well. Also, having a partner that cares about me really helps. In the past men have proven to be vile pigs. It's taken a while but he has helped me realise that not all men are out to hurt me. I've done a lot of trying to push him away, but he has stuck around despite my episodes. It's like the fog is gone and I can see things clearly again. I've made peace with the abuse I've suffered in the past.  Another thing that might have helped is (sorry, this is all really specific to me, but hopefully there is something in between the lines?) earlier in the year my rapist was sentenced to a very long time in prison. The whole process exacerbated the PTSD. Especially after I was pretty much forced to watch the recording of the act (yeah he was one fucked up dude). A lot of the stuff I had blocked or I was out of it when he choked me. The whole thing was messed up and bought back a lot of memories that would have just been better left hidden. And if I wasn't already messed up enough, it didn't help that I was already trying to come to terms with the abuse inflicted on me as a child. I think perhaps knowing that he is locked up helped somewhat. It sort of empowered me a little bit. But it did take a while to take a bit of a breath.   I still have flashbacks and stuff, but they are less. The nightmares have pretty much stopped. I have stopped smoking weed since I am sleeping better. I have also reduced the amount of alcohol I normally drink - not by choice, I just don't really feel like drinking it. I've been eating healthier, drinking more water. Just looking after myself."

The book Slaughterhouse Five is a good book in any case, but I believe it's a very fair representation of the way it feels to have PTSD. It is very odd to feel you've come unstuck in time.  I describe certain parts of PTSD as my brain reacting in the present to stimuli that are long since past. It's like your mental reactions are stuck on repeat, but at random intervals, so you might be tidying your bedroom one moment, and the next, you're seeing an image of the past overlaid on top of your current vision, and your brain is reacting to BOTH TIMES. It really is terrifying.  For me personally, I'd like to see a wider awareness of civilian PTSD. While I respect members of the military who are living with it, I'd also like to be included in whatever's going on. It sounds petulant, but... I'm suffering, too. I'm ""one of us,"" even though mine comes from other things. Sometimes I feel left out of public initiatives and stuff. It's like raising funds for [terrible disease of your choice]. No matter what flavor of [terrible disease of your choice] you cure, that cure or treatment will likely benefit EVERYONE with some type of [terrible disease of your choice]. Why not be inclusive?

ptsd,33ulox,The_Bombardier,2,Sun Apr 26 12:20:35 2015 UTC,"Assaulted at 11, diagnosed with PTSD (and bipolar) at 19 when I finally talked about. Manifested at hypervigilance, hypersexuality, eating issues, sleep issues, self-injury, and self-medication with drugs and alcohol. After a few months in patient at 19, things improved. I spent 7 years sober, and am mostly now at, at 29, in a healthy limited use point with alcohol (claiming it's ever possible to come back from addiction is controversial but it's happened for me, at least for now). I am also able to sleep much more deeply since I had a kid and had to get used to sleeping with a closet door open or knowing other people in the house were awake.  There are still some residual effects. For one, I'm still afraid in the dark. Note that I don't say I'm afraid of the dark, because I'm not. I'm afraid when it's dark, and I'm alone, so I tend to sleep with lights and leave lights on in the house. When I'm with other people, I'm fine, but alone II tend to lose my grip on reality a little bit. I used to have to check the whole house from top to bottom for any place that someone might be hiding. All doors had to be closed. Lights on in all rooms. And I would still, often, sit up in bed utterly terrified and unable to move or go turn on the light because i couldn't reach it, and stay up for hours, or until dawn. This was without internet, so it's not like I was distracting myself, I was literally just sitting there gripped with terror and trying not to breathe too loudly.  I still tend to be a little hypersexual. I want sex with my partner even when I'm not aroused or it doesn't feel particularly good, because the attention is validating, i think, and because there's a degree of control in it. This is much better than it was, when I slept around as a teenager or masturbated so compulsively I caused myself actual pain. But i still struggle with pornography, often because I choose porn that re-enacts, in some way, my assault and therefore re-traumatizes the brain and is just really unhealthy for me.  I also still don't like to be touched by most people. My kid, my partner, and lovers are the exception. I'm fine with hugging other people but I don't like to be hugged or patted  or anything without me initiating it. Even my own parents, which can be very hurtful to them. It feels threatening and oppressive to me.  Oh and panic attacks. These aren't frequent, but they suck ass. My last one occurred following the removal and replacement of my IUD. I made it to the car and was driving when it happened and I had to pull over. I sobbed, my neck stiffened up in a weird position (looking upward) and I was physically unable to look forward to drive, and I though I was going to die. I sobbed and freaked out for 40 minutes in my car.   Anyway, there are some ways it's affected my life."

ptsd,33ulox,Drabbeynormalblues,1 point,Sun Apr 26 07:09:49 2015 UTC,"I did six years in the military. I used to think that was the cause of my problems when in reality, much of it was from my childhood, though the shit I saw and experienced on active duty certainly didn't help.  The best way to describe it is imagining a pressure building in you. Every single moment it feels like its growing. Its never going to stop...just growing and growing. And you want to do anything...ANYTHING to either kill those feelings  or at least deaden them. This is why so many of us turn to destructive behaviors to try and self medicate.   You start hitting the fight or flight aspects of your humanity. How one responds is about as unique as the causes. For me, my drugs of choice were alcohol and violence. To this day, I cannot close my left hand without it cracking loudly from all the times I broke it on things and people.   The cruel thing about it is that your triggers can be almost anything. I've had it where I've been standing in line at an airport and I just want to scream and start smashing people in the face. Its terrifying to me because in that moment, there is nothing I can do but just outlast it. I once dislocating two fingers just trying to stay focus and not flip out.   Its been something like ten years since I have broken something or screamed at someone. But I still have to catch myself from losing control. And that is honestly the cruelest part. You don't get a cure. You at best get a safer coping mechanism.   The problem is that many folks expect a PTSD person to just ignore the problem or take care of the symptoms. Sort of like when they tell an alcoholic that if they didn't drink, they would be okay. But you got to sit down and examine your behavior. Figure out your triggers and do the hard work of self discovery. That's terrifying. The first time I started seeing a shrink, I would have rather been back on deployment.   For me, I stay away from alcohol. I have a job that requires extensive travel and overtime. So I don't usually have a lot of time on my hands to think. When I am alone with my thoughts, that is when I struggle."

ptsd,33uzl4,Drabbeynormalblues,2,Sun Apr 26 07:21:37 2015 UTC,"Thank you!  I was wondering about good literature on it too, you read my mind."
ptsd,33uzl4,Drabbeynormalblues,1 point,Mon Apr 27 02:23:30 2015 UTC,"You asked /u/mydaddyisadrunkass about bodily release of trauma. I think I can help answer that. I suffer from C-PTSD from childhood sexual abuse and often times people who suffer from PTSD have a lot of chronic pain or chronic disease issues. My molestation started when I was still in diapers so I literally did not have the words to process what was happening to me emotionally. As a result I react in certain ways to being touched and I don't know why. As I have moved through EMDR and internal family systems therapy I have noticed that I don't react that way anymore and can respond in more normal, healthy ways. My body is no longer keeping that trauma that my mind has trouble processing because I have now processed it in a healthy way and let it go."
ptsd,33uzl4,Drabbeynormalblues,2,Mon Apr 27 02:33:29 2015 UTC,"Yes, this is helpful.  I was asking because I had a certain bodily sensation, to the point of not being able to walk, as a young kid and one instance more recently while going through EMDR.  And unlike when I was a kid, this time while during the EMDR, the sensation/pain came and I couldn't walk again, but then it felt like it ""passed through"" or ""released"". I was not diagnosed with PTSD, but I stopped doing therapy shortly after the episode.  Does this sound like something similar?"
ptsd,33uzl4,mydaddyisadrunkass,1 point,Tue Apr 28 19:56:22 2015 UTC,Yep that sounds exactly like something that EMDR was designed to treat and a great example of how the body keeps the score so to speak.
ptsd,33uto6,Meggles85,1 point,Sat Apr 25 21:01:30 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of grounding and awareness excercises that help a person be able to stay ""in your body"" or ""in the present"" and with practice it can reduce the number of depersonalization incidents. Restorative yoga also helps to calm the body and mindfulness meditations help me remain in the present. Things that engage the senses are also very helpful for me, such as cooking or gardening. I like cooking bacon specifically because it takes a while and it isn't complicated so I don't get frustrated. I focus on the sound of the sizzling and watch the grease accumulation and the slow visual changes in the bacon. The smell is another obvious sense that is engaged! Gardening in general is rewarding for me but the sensory engagement is calming. I focus on the smell of the dirt, the texture of the leaves, the sound of the water landing on the dirt. I hope this gives you and your partner some helpful ideas!"
ptsd,33uto6,cyanoside,1 point,Sat Apr 25 22:59:59 2015 UTC,"I served in 2008-2013.  I can advise that avoiding places and stress factors will only make future episodes worse.  For example, if he had a bad episode at work, that place now will always be a stress factor and he will be more at risk of an episode in the future.  You can limit your time there but not avoid it altogether as it only makes it worse.  I too suffer from panic attacks (loud noises included, besides obvious fireworks slamming doors and garbage trucks dropping garbage bins).  There are usually 3 different ways people will react when a panic attack reaches final stages: fight, run away, or freeze. I experience freezing 99% of the time and have to sit down, close my eyes and take deep breaths tru my nose and exhale thru my mouth.  Locking myself in a dark closet where I'm safe also helps me.  DO NOT restrain your boyfriend is he is having a panic attack!  If he wants space just let him be.  It generally takes me 2-3 days after an episode to reset my mood. It is important that you recognize this fact with your SO and know that his body will be drained of ""happy hormones"" during this time. During this time it is important to know that he is ""useful"" and not a burden to the family.  Give him a list of chores you can complete together and reward him.  Veterans more often than not feel as if they are ""not pulling their weight"" and are a burden to society around them. It is ingrained in our nature and you must nourish this.   Also I'd advise avoiding alcohol during this time because it tends to send you into an emotional rollercoaster and almost a guaranteed mental breakdown  As far as drugs I have no advise other than my VA psychiatrist recommended SSRIs but I so far have refused to take any.   I self-medicate with very small dosage of medical marijuana because I get paranoid taking any amount that's large enough to get me high.  Marijuana is helpful because it suppresses body's dream state and makes you have dream-free sleeping - in my case that's a very good thing and a blessing.    Bad dreams would be a bad occurence because the feelings you experience during a dream are real, and when you wake up you have an equally realistic emotional response to this dream.  This, in a way, makes you relive the trauma over and over again.  Just this morning I cried for 2 hours on and off.  It can happen."

And she can with the right help, but be prepared for the possibility of a long, hard journey. Good luck to you both!"
ptsd,33svrn,tallgirl32,1 point,Sat Apr 25 13:59:47 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your comment :-). She won't seek out medical help, she's stubborn and proud and wants to do it by herself. She's also worried about the professional implications so stuck in a circle. 😞😞"
ptsd,33svrn,tallgirl32,1 point,Sat Apr 25 14:26:47 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry to hear that. Please explain to her that PTSD is a result of a physiological change in the neurological function of the body. It is not a result of a weakness that can be fixed by willpower, pride or stubbornness. There is no dealing with it on your own, as PTSD is a challenge to address even when you have access to the best professional help.   I also don't know what professional implications there can be for her, as any sort of treatment is subject to the same privacy laws as any other kind of medical care. The professional implications will come as her level of functioning decreases and her coping mechanisms are challanged.   And unfortunately for you, because you sound like a loving and thoughtful partner, if she is unwilling to seek help, your relationship is on a downhill slide.   I would really encourage you to educate yourself on PTSD so that you understand what you are looking at. PTSD takes so much more than support from loved ones to recover from. It can't really be cured, but the symptoms can be managed effectively with the proper interventions.   My husband has been in treatment for severe trauma using something called Rapid Resolution Therapy, and it has been kind of mind blowing how quick and effective it has been after years (and years!) of talk therapy and medication. Also, look into EMDR, which can be particularly effective if the PTSD was caused by a specific event. Also, CBT and EFT are generally accepted as being effective. (I know this is lots of initials, but they will all come up if you ask the Google overlords)   Good luck, buddy. I am truly sending you my best wishes, and I hope that for both of your sakes you can talk her into getting some help."
ptsd,33svrn,lynxnloki,1 point,Sat Apr 25 19:32:13 2015 UTC,This is some really good advice. I'll talk to her again and see if I can get her to seek help. Thank you
ptsd,33svrn,Kooshboo,1 point,Sun Apr 26 10:34:19 2015 UTC,"If she won't seek medical help, how does she know that she has PTSD? It could be a variety of other illnesses.  This is sad, because I can tell you really want to help her. Yet we all know that you can't help someone who doesn't want to.   Is she pretty young? The idea of ""doing it yourself"" is troubling - patients can (and at many times, MUST) be very active in their own treatment, and ""help themselves"", but in many cases a professional is needed to make real progress. She's already developed the wrong skills and coping mechanisms in her brain - not her fault - and that's going to prevent her from healing herself, by herself only."
ptsd,33svrn,GenL,1 point,Sat Apr 25 19:45:13 2015 UTC,She's trained to recognise the symptoms of mental health so has diagnosed herself. She's pretty good at self reflection. We just go around in circles. Keep trying my best
ptsd,33svrn,BlueCatIsFat,1 point,Sun Apr 26 07:14:56 2015 UTC,"It's often hard to diagnose PTSD even for trained professionals.  It took almost 2 years to diagnose mine and that was with multiple doctors and medical tests.  One thing that you really should let her know is; if PTSD is left untreated for prolonged periods of time...it can get much worse.  It's super true that we must be very active in our own recovery, but having a professional there to guide you and help limit the damage that PTSD can do to the brain is important in the beginning...or as fast as you can get it.  The physical damage that some of these chemicals it releases into the brain can do, can become irreversible as time passes, leaving the person with permanent brain damage.  She definitely does not want to end up in that camp!  During my initial trauma, my best friend was present.  Mind you she had absolutely nothing to do with it...other than she happened to have gone with me.  She would try to interact with me but I simply could not disconnect her from what had happened.  The only solution I had was to separate from her mostly.  We talked through email and on the phone...saw each other maybe once a month.  After a few years, once I had treatment and a better grasp on myself and what was happening, I was ready to see her again and continue as much of a normal friendship as I could with her.  I'm sorry to hear you are in the position my friend was.  I can only imagine how horrible it must be to be on the other side of PTSD when you love the person and must watch them suffer through so many changes.  I think the best advice I could offer you, from the perspective of my experience, it will take lots of time and is really on her terms.  Encourage her to seek professional help.  She wouldn't try to cure her own cancer, she'd see a doctor!  Like any medical condition, there will be limits (like physical energy is a limit for some diseases) and those have to be accepted and expected.  hugs"

If your roommate is dating this guy he'll probably be around more as time goes on. Might be worth getting to know him enough that he doesn't seem like a stranger in your home.   At any rate, I'm going to guess you're younger, since you live with a roommate. That and the creepy part make the chances pretty good he won't be around forever."
ptsd,33sgcf,tw55n89,1 point,Sat Apr 25 06:20:12 2015 UTC,"Yes, I told her initially. My roommate was dating a coworker of mine who was in the military. This guy is an uber asshole, and I felt uncomfortable in my own home, he was also my coworker so I had to maintain a professional relationship with him. I told her that it made me uncomfortable (I was raped and tortured by a military guy, and a female friend of mine) and she insisted that I needed to get over it, and then I explained that I had to maintain a professional relationship with him. She claimed I was being cruel and emotionally abusive, but I was having panic attacks from him being over so frequently, and it wouldn't of been hard for them to go over his house. They broke up and I was luckily free of the situation. I do not think I was wrong in asking her to plan times where he would not be there. It would of been fine if it was a couple of times a week, but weeks on end was just an emotionally triggering and upsetting experience."
ptsd,33sgcf,milkymilkchan,1 point,Mon Apr 27 04:04:28 2015 UTC,"I didn't get diagnosed until my second year of university (my trauma happened in high school) so I kept my roommate informed about what was going on with me. I felt like she deserved to know. She was glad that I decided to seek out a psychologist, since in first year, she noticed that a lot of my behaviours corresponded with PTSD. She's been a wonderful support, even offering to leave a party with me one time when I was triggered and wanted to go home. This year I gained a third roommate who also knows and asks first before raising sensitive topics. I'm glad I told them because it makes my day-to-day life so much easier.  I think it would be a good idea to tell your roommate. You live with him, after all - he will likely see you having a panic attack sooner or later, and it's better that he knows what's going on if that should ever happen so that he can help you. You don't have to go into detail if you're not comfortable with it; simply tell him that you have a large fear of unfamiliar men because of your PTSD, so you'd appreciate it if he could try not to have his boyfriend over all of the time until you're used to him. Do try to get used to him, though - I know it's tempting to avoid him completely, but that will only guarantee that you will continue to feel scared of him. You could write out some sort of plan that involves taking small steps, like saying ""hi"" to him or even just waving, and eventually building your way up to longer and longer conversations. If you honestly and openly communicate with your roommate, I'm sure you two can come up with something that works for both of you. Good luck!"

It's very difficult to manage and can make you feel very frustrated with yourself.  During clear moments I'm using method I learnt in compassion focused therapy to try and help.  But still, that constant physical sense of something disastrous being about to happen is difficult on your mind and body. It always reminds me of that moment you realise someone thrown a foot ball at you unexpectedly and your whole body tenses and braces for impact. But nothing ever comes, and it seems to never end.  Accepting that this is what is happening right now and not being a dick to yourself over it (which I really tend towards) really helps relieve it sooner in my experience. The opposite action approach. It's not easy.  I hope yours passes soon.

Think about what you normally do to relieve stress or things that make you happy and try those (playing the piano, walking the dog). Meditation, mindfulness exercises, and restorative yoga could also be helpful to center yourself and refocus. Listening to a podcast or talking to a friend. Take a look at your thoughts. Maybe you are thinking negatively like ""I have so many letters to write and it overwhelms me so I just want to avoid and forget about it."" Instead of avoiding it, just focus on the doing one and then cheerlead yourself for getting it done. Maybe then you will feel more motivated and positive."

ptsd,33jril,BallPointPariah,1 point,Thu Apr 23 03:49:09 2015 UTC,Society?  I have to ask and I'm sorry for being so direct but how were you traumatized by society?
ptsd,33jril,CompMolNeuro,2,Thu Apr 23 03:59:36 2015 UTC,Psych wards.
ptsd,33jril,tri5,6,Thu Apr 23 04:00:51 2015 UTC,"I think I see.  You were either traumatized by some time in a psych ward or by the threat of being sent back to one.  Here are some cliches, you never know if one will help.  Everyone is going to die, we all have a clock ticking away and no one knows for sure when that clock will stop ticking.  Society is a game that we all play, whether we want to or not, and we don't get to choose our starting position.  Loa Tzu said it best when he was asked what was his philosophy for life.  He said, ""do your best, that is all the philosophy of living that anyone needs.""    For me, at my lowest point in my teens [not related to PTSD really, just teen angst] I came to the realization that I was the only one who could make me happy.  I kept relying on other people to make me happy and make me feel safe.  None of that was working.  Then one day I changed the way I saw everything and after that upsight was able to move on.  I wasn't suddenly happy or anything, but there was a great pressure that wasn't there all the time."
ptsd,33jril,lovinglily,1 point,Thu Apr 23 04:25:06 2015 UTC,"I used to always carry a knife, in fact an entire arsenal of things to ""help"" calm my nerves.  I was famous for it among my friends.   I could judge how symptomatic I was by how much I carried around.  Change of clothes  Spare fully charged phone battery  Swiss army knife  First aid kit  Multiple medications  Spare shoes  Energy bars  Disposable rain parkas  Sewing kit  Personal attack alarms  Pens and paper  Fans  Heat packs  Rope  The list could go on and on.  Through doing CBT and schema work I realised carrying those things around constantly while I was actively feeling very unsafe was reinforcing the belief that I wasn't safe.  While it made my symptoms worse at first to walk to the shops with just my coat and clothing, no ruck sack filled with things I might need if everything went to shit after a while they reduced.  Now it still often creeps back up on me. I just realised yesterday that I'm back to carrying a Swiss army knife, attack alarm and meds in my pockets again I recognise it sooner and can sort of try and work on it before it goes over board.  I imagine this isn't an issue for everyone.   And with regards to OPs concerns in a way it's true. You are never safe.  Life is a pain in the ass sometimes and bad things can happen all the time.   But not every one on the planet is constantly aware of that. If you have seen first hand evidence repeatedly in your life of just how shit things can get, to the point that your brain is in near constant disaster mode because you have ptsd the veil is lifted, you know how tenuous the line is between everything being fine and being a disaster is.  But it's no way to live your life.  You need to teach your brain again that while shit happens that maybe it won't, maybe everything will be ok.    It's really hard. But when things are less bad in my life I can leave the house, go places, meet people and not once think how is this going to go wrong. Who is going to hurt me. How will I fix it?  Short term solutions to long standing mental health problems tend to not work in anything but the short term in my experience.  The knife will help right now, but it won't help root out the issue, only make it livable in the moment you're facing it."
ptsd,33izar,8Erinyes8,3,Wed Apr 22 22:13:36 2015 UTC,"Honestly, even if you had said something to those girls, there is no guarantee they would have believed you or that it would have prevented your grandfather from abusing them. Regardless, if they were also abused, that is not your fault. You are a victim. Your grandfather is the only one responsible for his actions.  You seriously need therapy, and I know you said you have some financial/insurance obstacles to that. But there are still resources out there for free that help people like you. What country/region do you live in?"
ptsd,33izar,mr_fishy,1 point,Thu Apr 23 02:29:03 2015 UTC,Connecticut in USA. It is hard to think I am not at fault for not warning them. The pain and shame is so great... it is overwhelming.
ptsd,33izar,mr_fishy,2,Thu Apr 23 02:51:18 2015 UTC,"Okay, here's a link to a crisis center that offers free counseling in your state. Please call them, they have a 24 hour hotline. I'm sure they can help you get the resources and help you need.   I honestly can relate to how you're feeling. I went through a very similar feeling whenever I first escaped an abusive home. My brother physically abused me for about a decade when I still lived with my family, but once I was old enough for college I moved to a new city to get away from him.   I needed to get out for my own health and safety, but I still felt horribly guilty and anxious because I left behind my little sister. She is five years younger than my brother and was only nine years old when I left home. Although I was definitely the main target of his abuse, I was older than him and still larger than him up until I was in high school, so I could defend myself. My sister, on the other hand, was only half his size. I was terrified that after I left he would turn on her, and I had seen him get violent with her before (although rarely).   My step father (the father of both my siblings but not me) was emotionally abusive and whenever I refused contact with my brother he would often use my sister as a guilt trip, saying I was a horrible sister because I wasn't there for my siblings or that she missed me and didn't understand why I wouldn't visit her. I was really torn up about it for a long time. I felt like I was a failure for not being there for her and protecting her when I knew it was not only possible but likely that my brother would hurt her.   At the end of the day though, only my brother was and is responsible for his actions. I was a child when these awful things happened to me. So were you. No one is capable of handling that sort of trauma well, and children certainly shouldn't be expected to deal with that sort of thing. What happened to you was a tragedy. But at the point where you could have warned those girls, you still didn't even fully comprehend what happened to you. So no one should expect you to have been able to save them - you were still dealing with your own issues. That's not your fault. It is your abuser's. You need to get to a place where you can handle your own problems before you can really do anything about someone else's."

In my late teens, I was an incredibly violent and cruel person. I made vulnerable people suffer. I personally passed on the abuse.   The guilt is unbearable. I have nothing I can say that will make you feel better or help you figure this out. Maybe it'll be nice to know you're not the only one who feels guilty."

A lot of your post really speaks to me on a personal level, from the intense irrational hatred to the guilt. My abuser had plenty of access to his two young nieces as well as a number of my childhood friends, and I am almost confident that he got to at least one of those girls. I carried/carry the guilt of not being able to protect them better.   I eventually accepted that my abuser was ultimately responsible for his actions, and he alone. Even if I kept those awful memories and told someone about them, my testimony alone may not have saved my cousins or friends. He was a predatory, manipulative adult that already had access to several vulnerable children like myself. That is all it takes. He could have been abusing all of us around the same time, for all I know, and none of us said anything. I blame no one but him, and the same should apply to you.  Children should not be held responsible for ""telling on"" trusted adults for violating their trust and assaulting them. You are not at fault. You are not responsible for a sick man's actions."

If all those bases are covered and I am feeling survival instincts kick in, then it is some layer of the onion wanting to be peeled back.

It went well for two months, things started to getting better and picked up my life a little, until I had to step into a bar fight. Flashbacks returned just a couple of seconds after the adrenaline was gone and I went to the back. Freaked out over there, tried to get my shit together, and finished my shift.  This happened a couple of times more and after that and some advice from friends, I decided to quit my job for the better cause.   Since then I have been looking for a reason why this would still happen, but of course no answer.

It may also be a side effect of certain medications (e.g., antipsychotics and long-term use of SSRI antidepressants).  Individuals with blunted or flat affect show different regional brain activity when compared with healthy individuals.

ptsd,335chs,Issues-anon,4,Sun Apr 19 20:58:28 2015 UTC,"The freeze response is the most common and powerful survival response for when the body undergoes trauma. It's not fight-or-flight like we are lead to believe. It is freeze first. Then flight, then fight, then fawn (asking for mother/ calling for help.) All non-vital functions are shut down to prevent heart attack/fainting/ loosing consciousness. It can lead to shock and death. Having PTSD means that often your trigger response can be to become numb. It's normal, as in it's what normal people experience when put under extreme stress. You will find your own way of dealing with it I'm sure. I am someone who often experiences delayed responses and its a shame because I feel it makes people think I am a robot or uncaring. I'm not, I just feel so intensely that I stop feeling. My circuits freeze."

ptsd,335chs,Layil,1 point,Thu Apr 23 10:06:01 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I think people think that because I talk about it without the emotion or fear visible, that it doesn't affect me or the pain I am in regularly is minimized because when faced with discussion about things or having to do things like go to work and pretend to be normal, I shut down. Even sometimes I wonder if it was all really that bad. But then the nightmares and flashbacks and times when I connect with it all emotionally show up and I am destroyed by it. And now I do have awareness that even though I am talking normally or have those moments of being detached, it is all there, lurking below ready to strike when I become vulnerable or my defenses are down."

ptsd,330ny0,WhiteRun,4,Sat Apr 18 10:29:58 2015 UTC,"Are there any mental health clinics near you? Do you have insurance to cover counseling? There's great variety in the quality and experience of mental health professionals, but if you can find a PTSD specialist in your area, that might be a good start.  More and more studies are showing that children exposed to violence and trauma get ""rewired"" to put it in basic terms. So, yeah, if you had a rough childhood, you could be at risk for PTSD. No one here can actually diagnose you, but we would no doubt all tell you that you aren't alone, you aren't crazy, and that it's helpful and healthy to vent your frustrations and to seek help.  You can manage PTSD, but knowing what to expect from yourself, knowing which thoughts, behaviors may be caused by PTSD, and working out a plan for yourself to help cope with those thoughts and behaviors are all useful benefits of having an actual diagnosis.  If you can't afford to get an actual diagnosis, not good but no matter to you as far as control. You can still use the tips others use to help with insomnia, flashbacks etc.; you don't need a piece of paper with ""Diagnosis: PTSD"" on it to go ahead and use strategies that others with anxiety-disorders find helpful.  Thanks for sharing your experience with the sub. Each person's personal journey and experience matter, and add to what we know."
ptsd,330ny0,grundyhippie,2,Sat Apr 18 13:33:39 2015 UTC,Thanks. I don't have insurance and I'm not sure if health care here covers that kind of thing. Maybe if I was actually diagnosed with PTSD I could get some assistance with it but otherwise it would be out of pocket or I'd need insurance.   How long would an actual diagnosis take? Is it the kind of thing that can be done in a short time or weeks/month of counseling?
ptsd,330ny0,grundyhippie,1 point,Sun Apr 19 11:10:50 2015 UTC,"I am not familiar with how every Psych pro would handle this, but I imagine they would have you fill out some questionnaires, interview you, maybe have you do a test or two. It wouldn't take long, and some would feel confident in diagnosing you on the first visit with enough compelling evidence.  Even if you aren't able to get a diagnosis right away, use the resources on dealing with trauma and aftermath that are available on the interwebs, but take everything with a grain of salt. Each person's experience is different, and each person heals in their own way on their own schedule.  The main things to work on:  Strategies for dealing with flashbacks/ triggers.  Strategies for dealing with disruption of function (when you isolate, cut, can't concentrate, can't leave the home, become depressed, etc.)  Monitoring yourself for negative thoughts, learning to redirect thoughts and vent appropriately.

Then one day it hit me. I wasn't born fucked up. I was fucked up by a fucking fucked up childhoos and depression is nothing but a form of PTSD.  When a young person is exposed to too much horrible crazy shit, their brain literally recoils. In order to survive, the mind numbs itself out to protect itself against further assaults and trauma. This is depression and it is PTSD.  The cause of depression is not a ""chemical imbalance"". That is a lie made up by those who profit by selling antidepressant drugs in spite of the fact that they rarely if ever work to eliminate depression long-term.  My brain chemistry is just fine - it's all the crazy horrible shit that fucked me up.

I would wake up feeling like I was back there everyday, for me therapy only triggered me more. There are medications that can help with the nightmares, prazosin being one and trazodone being another. I do recommend talking about it to someone who hasn't betrayed you, because it can feel like any progress you made is now invalid because you no longer feel worth love. You are worth love by the way, abuse just messes with you to the point where you no longer feel human or worth as much as other people.

I didn't realize that this was a trend until about 6 months into my relationship with my husband. I thought he was trying to control, manipulate, and crush me, so I had extreme feelings of hatred and resentment for him, and I'd try to crush him in response. It wasn't real, and it totally broke me when I realized that. I was emulating my abuser (dad).   I'm in therapy, I journal, but I don't take any medication either. Reading Brene Brown's books really helped me, but I'm still working on coping skills. Also-- being as direct and honest with my husband as possible and being assertive about my feelings IMMEDIATELY after they were triggered instead of turtle-shelling. It sucks, but we have much fewer arguments. This helped for me. I hope you know you're not alone.   -edit- also, after I realized what I was doing, it took me 8 months of crying every day before I felt better.

So I'll take a risk & be blunt and hope that it doesn't hurt your feelings or ruin your day (because that's not what I want.)  Your reasons are dumb. Every single relationship on this planet goes through stuff like that, even the ""perfect"" ones that last a lifetime. I say that bluntly with the hopes that it will give you relief (not make you feel criticized.)  This part is a bit more of a risk, because I'll acknowledge it's directly about you whereas the paragraph above was about your reasons, not you. Anyway, your reasons are also self-centered. Is he not allowed to have feelings? To feel uncomfortable? To feel vulnerable? To be human? You're being intolerant of that which makes him a human being.  This next paragraph (below)is downright judgmental, so please forgive me. It's also not meant to be hurtful or rude, but I realize that the kind & polite thing would be to keep it to myself and it has a very high likelihood of upsetting you. Forgive me for that (and I truly hope you take it as food for thought & that it doesn't hurt you). I also hope people don't downvote me to hell, because I'm taking time out of my day to genuinely try to be helpful to a stranger who asked for help...  Sorry, but here goes: It is my personal opinion that identifying as poly is a load of crap. It's not a sexual preference like being straight/gay/bi/asexual. I feel like there are a lot of vocal advocates on the web who make it sound as if ""identifying as poly"" is the same thing, and perhaps that sounded good to you, and maybe you took their encouragement & support seriously...  ...so I'm taking a risk that you might feel hurt (I hope not) or that the hivemind might downvote me to hell. But hear me out...  I accept that you prefer to have polyamorous relationships. That's your business, not mine. I don't think it's some kind of sin, or bad morals or whatever. It's a choice and it's your business and if you find other consenting adults who want to have polyamourous relationships with you, then that's their choice, too.  But it's not a sexuality and it's not a gender-indentification. It's not something to proclaim like a gay person does: ""I was born this way, so accept me!"" Or like a trans-person (or gender neutral, or non-binary, or genderfluid, etc) person saying, ""This is who I am, don't assign social stereotypes on me!""  In fact, I think the ""I indentify as poly"" people actually do harm to those who feel they have to proclaim (and even defend) the gender or sexual preference they identify with.  You're not ""poly"" anymore than I'm ""mono."" You choose the kind of relationship you want. Plenty of people would love to have sex & intimacy with more than one person, myself included. I'd go so far as to say most people would like to have intimacy with more than one person, but there are a whole lot of reasons why people choose to be faithful to one person even though they want to be with more than one person.  The reason I'm saying this is because I want you to realize that it's not like this guy needs to just accept your gender or sexuality. That's a whole other thing, entirely.  Now, to wrap up everything (not just the poly part) but if you love this guy, then at least 50% of your thoughts (if not more) should be about your consideration of his feelings and needs and hopes and dreams and vulnerabilities and humanity. That's what a loving relationship is. And it ain't pretty sometimes, because sometimes it's hard to be that selfless with anyone and see past all the things about them that are obnoxious or icky --- but that's exactly what love is.  If you're spending more time thinking about yourself & about judging whether or not his guy measures up, then you don't love him. And that's fine. If you don't love him then move on. But maybe that will give you a different frame to think about this relationship. Stop analyzing him & judging him and start thinking about whether you love him.  I hope I haven't hurt you, and I hope you find happiness & peace."

I'm trying to figure out whether the issue I'm dealing with is just a trigger that I need to work through, or whether I'm giving my partner too much consideration instead of thinking about my own needs enough.  I don't really feel like either of those could be solved by thinking more about his needs and his perspective.  But something is causing me a dramatic increase of flashbacks and panic attacks in the past few months, and I need to navigate out of that somehow.  I can understand if that didn't come through very clearly in the original post; reading it again, I feel like I was still talking around the issue instead of stating it clearly...    But then again, arguing with you seems to have helped me put that into words.  So hooray for dialogue!  As for polyamory; to me ""I identify as poly"" is not meant to be identical to sexual orientation or gender identity, but more like I'd say I ""identify"" as a feminist or a democrat.  So I kinda feel like you made a hasty assumption before you started criticizing me on that.  But whatever, you didn't cause me any harm by telling me your thoughts on it.  :)  I do really appreciate your blunt honesty, and the care you took to try to soften it without hiding your opinion.

It's slowly been getting better and i've been able to make 4 or 5 new tracks a year, but i feel that it's still wrapped up in the fact that i still avoid every reminder of what's happened to me."
ptsd,32un9c,techlos,3,Fri Apr 17 01:00:53 2015 UTC,"I found my love of writing when I was in sixth grade and struggling with my mental health. (Could've also contributed to the PTSD, that's another story.) I wrote so many short stories, I fought tooth and nail to get into Advanced Placement English, I journal-ed daily. After I was raped that changed. I can write a basic email. I can write lab reports and technical documents and papers. But I can't summon the creativity or the energy to write a story or a fanfiction. I don't have words for my emotions because words aren't big enough for my feelings.  I had to write a creative piece for a class recently. It was the second creative piece I had written since being raped. My friends are disturbed but said it was well done. It was therapeutic, but I wish I had ideas for a story, or for a fanfiction.  Journaling has been super on and off. Everything I write sounds disconnected and numb. I'm trying to make it more of a habit, and that part works, it just sounds terrible and mismatched with what I'm actually experiencing.  It's been almost four years for me, so in some ways it's improved. I think time will tell. I'm hoping forcing myself to continue my ""crappy"" journaling will bring something back."
ptsd,32un9c,c0balt_60,2,Sun Apr 19 23:20:16 2015 UTC,"So much this. I loved to write. It was my hidden talent and guilty pleasure. It was the best thing I was really GOOD at. It was air and my life boat. I still have so much in my head, characters to birth and worlds to create. I have ideas and scenes and backgrounds and details and nothing to do with it all. I think about it ALL. THE. TIME. My characters have conversations and I follow them through their ups and downs in my head. I have whole series in my head. I day dream often and every night I go to bed, I'm working on my books in my head. I can sit down and write bits and pieces here and there- really just jotting down notes and the odd back and forth conversation i don't want to forget, or some kind of world dynamic. But if I want to actually sit down and write? Nothing. If I do manage more than a paragraph it's horrible and embarrassingly bad. And it's such a fucking effort just to do that. But it's ALWAYS in my head. In the shower, driving to work, at work, walking my dog, shopping... I just can't get it out. And the effort of even reaching mediocrity is exhausting. I pretty much just gave up the ghost and haven't even tried in over a year. Now it's like I just can't be bothered. The time I could be dedicating to trying to get it back is better wasted on video games, Netflix, or other people's books. Things that won't disappoint. I hope someday I can find my way back but for now, here there be monsters."

I have all these ideas that I want to put into words   Hello there, I'd like to offer some suggestions, as I can relate and understand where you're coming from. Your PTSD is manifesting itself as writer's block and likely making you feel overwhelmed and tired.  My advice is to not focus on ""big ideas"" or writing projects but instead start small, and get used to the feeling of actually finishing something. For example, I like to submit to /r/sixwordstories and have a backlog of ideas that I keep for that subreddit; also, /r/OneParagraph is a good place for ideas and concepts I want to explore a little more.  There are a bunch of these type subreddits, if you care to look. Also, instead of using a computer to write, perhaps try a Moleskine or perhaps your phone.  Perhaps your computer is a trigger.   Best of luck, and I hope to read some of your work soon!"

When starts happening there may be a small kinda thing to notice that you will get. God me I would hear a voice out of place and I knew a flashback was coming on. If you can a acknowledge that it is a flashback during that will hopefully help you as it did me. Another thing is to keep something strange on you to feel when you have a flashback. God me it is a necklace of a Buddha. I rub my finger over its face and it keeps part of me present.

My doctor actually recommended something similar a while back, that I should play my dreams in my head and imagine a positive ""solution"" to the scenarios while awake, but the issue that I had was that my brain is sneaky and would switch things about on me so my solutions didn't work. Sounds like the therapy here involves additional strategies, so could be worth looking into!"
ptsd,32qwth,JSEdward,7,Thu Apr 16 00:10:17 2015 UTC,"My SO suffers from major depression but keeps himself in check around it. It's wonderful being able to relate so well with one another on dealing with mental illness. Doing some occasional therapy together is really nice, too. I was scared of therapy alone at first, so I asked if he could come with. It sort of took off from there. We don't do it together to manage anything between us so much as we do it to learn how to help each other. Sometimes it's all about me and other times it'll be about what he's dealing with. I guess we're therapeutic sidekicks for one another. I can't remember a period in my life that was as optimistic and stable as it has been the past four years with him.  So in other words- you don't have a bad plan if you meet someone who you can change for the better with :) that's really the important thing to seek out."
ptsd,32qwth,hoursaid,3,Thu Apr 16 01:53:51 2015 UTC,"I can share my experience with it... I was in a relationship where both of us have/had PTSD.  We were drawn to the other and it was the basis of our relationship (I feel).  It was a whirlwind of wanting to help the other, deflect our own stuff by focusing on the other, having someone there that truly got one another, and having a savior complex on both ends.    It was fantastic for the first 6 months or so... then it turned bad pretty fast.  Being in the relationship hindered my ability to focus and heal the self.  I was going through therapy and needed to go into the darkest parts of my trauma (was molested when 7).  We eventually started to feed off of each others anxiety.  I became withdrawn due to dissociation and pressure, she probably felt abandoned. We both weren't healthy and not good with boundaries.  She wanted me to propose and I resisted because the relationship still felt new (just under a year in).  She cheated when she went back home and it went to hell in a handbasket.  Her and I, we weren't whole. I was just trying to fill this hole in my soul by bringing her in to my life, it didn't work...    This was several years ago now, I was devestated.  I handed myself over to the therapy process, really immersed myself in it.  My mantra was, ""the way out is through"".  I've made great strides (still have work to do) but in the end what I want is a relationship where 2 whole people come together.  Now I am better than I have ever been, navigated dating for a while, did my best at seeing potential red flags, and am actually in a new relationship.    TLDR: Dated a woman with PTSD while I had PTSD, our inability to cope with PTSD led to its downfall.  The way through is healing yourself first IMO"
ptsd,32qwth,pole7979,2,Thu Apr 16 15:06:26 2015 UTC,"I'd say that you're asking for troubles, kind of. What if your date is unable to relate your trauma, or vice versa? In relationship it doesn't matter if the other haven't experienced the same as you are, they can still listen and say their opinion to the issue.  For example my SO's dad is completely fine, where I got traumas for losing mine. We still can discuss about that (even I prefer not to).  EDIT: I did not mean that you shall keep it to yourself, ofc not, but if you assume that you will be completely understood just having someone else with PTSD you are in dangerous waters. I'd say that anyone who is good listener will help you. But if it affects to your life quality, see some pros."
ptsd,32q43z,AnnaBreit,5,Wed Apr 15 20:28:35 2015 UTC,"A mixture of internal family systems therapy, EMDR, and the book The Body Keeps The Score by Bessel Van Der Kolk has helped me move past my PTSD. I still have symptoms from time to time but it takes a tremendous amount of stress for that to happen. My therapist highly follows Van Der Kolk's work as he is currently the world's leading expert in overcoming PTSD and I have found his methods extremely helpful. Other than that I utilize the hotlines when I need them and attend a survivor's support group. Sometimes I find it beneficial to be around people who ""get it"" and whom I don't have to explain it to.  Other than that, I've found that open communication with my partner helps me to connect with them. I let my partner know how I'm feeling in the moment, what I need, and in turn my partner respects my boundaries and gives me whatever I need whatever that looks like. When I'm in a better place and able to connect I make sure to let my partner know that what I experience is the trauma I lived through and not how I actually feel about my partner. I make sure to let him know how much I love and appreciate him. I make an effort to connect to him and with him in ways that make me feel comfortable. In those moments where I'm having a moment I let him know that even though he may be doing something that is triggering, it's not how I normally feel about him and it's not his fault. Above all else I check in to see what his needs are frequently. Sometimes he can't connect or is burnt out because I've been a mess and I let him know that's okay. In those moments I focus on my self care and what I need to do to keep myself safe. I also encourage him to take care of his needs and to be good to himself. If he is stressed out and grumpy he's going to trigger me further and we're not going to be able to connect."

ptsd,32q43z,Robin_Could,2,Wed Apr 15 23:23:27 2015 UTC,I have found it extremely helpful versus traditional psychotherapy techniques. It helps me process things in a way that isn't emotionally overwhelming and I feel like I'm letting go of some of the baggage or junk I've been carrying around. I have done traditional talk therapy and haven't found it nearly as helpful as IFS in moving past my trauma.
ptsd,32q43z,Drabbeynormalblues,2,Thu Apr 16 01:00:39 2015 UTC,"Thats a technique I've never heard of. A large degree of my trauma is rooted in my family, particually my sister's random and unpredictable bouts of anger and screaming so it may help."

ptsd,32q43z,Robin_Could,1 point,Thu Apr 16 05:11:03 2015 UTC,"It is about all the different parts inside of yourself rather than your actual family. I can see why you would think that though. The title is referring to the family of ""parts"" inside ourselves. Like you might have a part of you who constantly calls you worthless, but than another that says you have to be perfect, and another who doesn't want you to get close to anyone. But it is based on the premise that you have a ""true core"" self that can therapy/talk with these other parts to understand and empathize with them... It could be helpful for you though, because I have noticed a lot of my other ""parts"" I hear are really the negative voices of family members that I have incorporated into my self image... I hope that makes sense. Sorry I am really tired. But there is a lot of information online."

You could talk to your therapist about that kind of method.  Mindful meditation is something I now do every night. It is something that does take time and practice though. It took me a few years to be able to utilize the skills. I still get lost every once and a while, but I can hide it and work around the chunks if I need to now."

It's even worse if I'm having to write stuff down, because then I can't even force the words out, it's just instant blankness.   This is probably a long shot as it's not a technique everyone can use, but for me, switching languages can help temporarily.

I have a small crystal that has a lot of sentimental value;  I roll it around in my palm to help keep me calm when my ptsd acts up - it's a mixture of the texture and memories that helps.   It might also not be a bad idea to bring someone you trust to act as your buffer or checker. They can stay by your side and act casual, and help intervene if you start to get worked up. You can use the excuse that you're helping them to get to know more people, or that they have been helping you with projects at home so you invited them along - that way no one really questions it.

You need an independent therapist not beholden to the school if this is the case.  I hope you find peace and the help that you need. You are clearly trying. Don't GIVE UP because of 2 unhelpful people."

Shes aware of my psychiatric history and how serious the issue is.   My therapist had me do biofeedback for a bit which didn't help. DBT helped when I did it a few years back but using those skills in severe crisis is impossible. He and I would talk and he keep talking about ""teaching me/learning to cope"" with things but never gave me anything concrete. I would come in, talk a bit, but stopped coming out with any perspective or strategy to deal.   I think my traumas were enough ""tough love."" I keep telling myself, ""grow up, no ones going to help you in the real world."" But when I reach out I'm looking for the opposite.  I'm not sure if there's a low cost clinic. I was seeing an outside counselor but had to stop since they no longer accepted my insurance and I would have to pay $$$ per visit.  The school has been up and down with accommodations. I've just been feeling like I'm being left in the dark about my own condition. No one - not my old therapist from home either - told me about some of the symptoms of PTSD that I experience -- like concentration issues for a big one. I've been trying for ten years and I keep feeling more and more angry and desperate."

This sounds silly, but make sure you are drinking enough water. Sometimes we don't take care of ourselves, and don't hydrate enough. This isn't our core ""problem,"" but being dehydrated can definitely exacerbate unclear thinking. I always try to ask myself if I've had enough to drink when I get super scatter-brained.  If you have too much work and you think you can't handle it, you have to confront that. It's okay to say you can't manage; it's okay to hit a snag and then come back and try harder.  Do some journaling/venting in a safe place to try to get your fears/anxieties out of your head, where you can look at them. What is making you anxious? Have you stopped trusting yourself? Is your environment reminding you of trauma? Name it. Name whatever is giving you grief.  Then you can try to find some ways to alleviate it. You may have to study somewhere else. You may be able to find a way to subsititute intrusive thoughts with other, more pleasant thoughts just temporarily.  It sucks to feel alone, like you're in some vast ocean and ships keep passing by and ignoring your cries for help. That's how it feels sometimes. But you are so worth fighting for.  Do what you have to do to feel safe, and don't let other people's lack of awareness make you doubt yourself."

I was so in love with someone and suddenly, I couldn't even smile around them anymore. My friends would tell me I was overreacting and compare me being stalked and having a miscarriage from a guy who locked my in the restroom with him to any of their ""problems"" and do the old ""just be happy"" routine.  I couldn't tell my family because I've been so emotionally distant with them. At this time, I still was being stalked so I'm not sure it would be consisted PTSD yet, but it was tearing my life apart.   I had luckily saved my easier courses for last. One professor, I told emailed about the miscarriage and she told the other professors that I was going through something unfathomable and to expect a struggle that was out of character but not to ask questions. One of them refused to accept my late or incomplete work so my GPA sucked.  I know it's awful because I've been there. I really had no one. I just self art and music therapied myself. It was all I knew how to do. I also just read when I wasn't lying listening to Death Cab For Cutie and staring at the ceiling hoping no one was watching me.   One day, you'll be like me and look back and all you'll be able to do is wonder how you put up with such awful people and how did you survive such a horrific trial.  I don't know how I'm still even Jewish, but I am. I don't believe G-d helped me. I maybe just need a reason to have survived what I thought was impossible to live through. Anyway, when I started hallucinating shadows of my stalker the next year and went through the situation you did with my therapist, I looked into some support groups around my little radius. I found one at the Jewish Family Center that helped a lot.  I guess that's my advice. I'd seek help outside of just meeting with a professional. And don't just search for PTSD, but other mental situation associated with it (stress,  depression, anxiety, etc.). Look outside the box.  Also know that just because something is held at a religious facility, doesn't mean you have to be of that religion or religious at all.  Free help is free help. And everyone in that room will have been through a hell you'd never know, so it's judgement free. That concept helped me open up a lot.  Also, painting, writing, and music helped me a TON.

I have a really difficult time reaching out to my professors in general. I was in the ER for suicidal ideation and I tried to work with student life to get extensions on work. My counselor was going to submit paperwork to one of the deans, who was going to help work with my professors. I never heard back from the dean and my counselor said he was pretty sure he submitted it.  I keep looking at all the things that I should've done differently, or actions I could've taken. Like, ""I could've emailed these professors,"" or ""I could've scheduled this meeting,"" or ""I could've gone to this person,"" but that's half the problem. I keep thinking, ""It isn't that bad"" because I've learned that I'm not going to be taken seriously so it must not be that bad. I don't want to tell all of my professors I have PTSD but I have nothing in place to make that not an issue. I keep getting told, ""you can have these conversations on your own.""  As far as friends... I have the same issue. Reaching out to them is exhausting because they see all of my problems in their own framework.

I went to a private university that had like 10-15 people in every class, but I know those things are different for everyone.   I was suggesting to look outside the conventional methods a little. I know the hardest part really is just bringing yourself to do it, but if/when you do it goes a long way.   But oh goodness yes!!! It's always yoga or some damn diet!  I think people are just so disconnected from each other these days that we don't know how to handle other people in person.   That's why I was suggesting maybe finding a group. It's a place where you can say anything out loud with the knowledge that no one will judge you, and even if you can't open up immediately (I couldn't) hearing others speak, even if they have depression and not specifically PTSD, really does help with opening up.  But what makes something traumatic is that we don't know how to cope. Hell, I haven't dated anyone in five years. None of us take a middle school class on how to react to trauma because there is no set way. Feelings over power judgment and that is in no way your fault.  Don't feel like you failed yourself for not doing this or that.  That's the most important thing.

I even had a male friend say it in a board game where everyone was decimating me and I wasn't having much luck with the randomized aspects on top of it.  Does anyone have any insight into why that pattern seems to be the trend? I've heard a lot of guys using that word in so many situations where it's pretty uncalled for.

Just having even a random person tell you that you are not alone in feeling like this and there are ways to help but you really have to learn how to live with it.

ptsd,3265rx,doggon1tt,13,Fri Apr 10 22:22:03 2015 UTC,"However sometimes when she's like this and her dog is in the room she will pull and immediate and jarring 180 and begin lavishing incredible amounts of vocal and physical affection on her dog and when she's finished go back to the way she was before when interacting with me.   Don't regard this as a bad thing or as a sign she doesn't have PTSD. In fact, with PTSD throw all logic out the window cause half the time it won't make sense.  Animals are an important tool in therapy, especially dealing with PTSD. My dogs help me sleep at night and I've made strives in ways that were impossible before them. I can't comment on why your girlfriend would be able to respond to her dog in ways she can't to humans, but I can explain why I can.  A big part of much of my trauma has to do with trust and safety. When my husband was gone working, I would spend most of the night awake, on the couch, with all the lights on. I would clear the house (search for someone hiding) several times. On average, I got maybe 3-4 hours of sleep. I couldn't walk outside when it was dark. Period. When my husband would be home, I would still have nights of waking up screaming and in sheer panic. Not fun. Then we got our first dog with the notion of having her trained for therapy. She was selected based on her temperament. Honestly, I haven't taken her to training (beyond what we have done) because I don't need her for that. I needed her to just be with me. She isn't human, she doesn't want anything, she isn't going to turn on me, she has no human motives or abilities, and she is protective of me. I can sleep alone because she is there and I can open the door at night to let her out to potty.  She is my dog, nothing more, and I don't have to deal with the human side of that relationship because she simply isn't human.  My dog also provides a comfort my husband can't. In some ways, he is in the same boat as you with understanding. If I'm upset and my blood pressure is going up, she knows and will sit with me. If I wake up, she is there. Even when my husband is home, she goes to bed with me even when he stays up. She needs no explanation from me and she doesn't need to understand. She just knows I'm not happy and wants to comfort me. I also get a grounding from her by being able to touch and pet her. She will lean against me to let me know she is there or lay on the floor next to me, just cause. I can't do this with my husband completely. Not yet, but with her I've gotten further than I was with trust. I've learned I can trust her and that has helped me be able to be more open and trusting of my husband. It's small steps. I screw up still and regress, but with her I'm better.   I guess the short of it in my speculation is because my dog isn't a human. My dog is nothing in relation to the trigger and therefore is in no way a threat, even subconsciously. My husband is human, therefore related to the threat, even though he isn't the trigger or the threat. No it doesn't make since, nor will it. It's not even about my husband. Has nothing even close to doing with him.   I know this is a bit rambly, but I hope it helps. If you have any questions, ask."

When I learned more about how to regulate my tension, I showed behaviour like your girlfriend does now. I would feel the freeze mode coming and to prevent it I would step away from the situation. Like a time out. Petting an animal was and still remains the best way for me to ground again and to counter severe dissociation and freezing. When I felt able again to deal with people I would do that, sometimes picking up the situation where I left it, sometimes just talking about something else completely.  I think it's a good sign that your girlfriend does this. It means that she is able to feel her needs at that moment and act on it. As long as she respects you by being open to talking about the fight at a later time, I would advice to give her the space to do this.  I know that it helped me a lot. Also seeing that my then boyfriend found it important that I took good care for myself, gave me more confidence. All in all it helped me to be able to communicate with him again quicker and the moments that I had to turn away went down. And yes, she probably at that moment feels that you are a threat to her, but that she is possible to do this instead of freeze also shows her trust in you."

Morris, I just got it off audible for $15, and watch the documentary ""Restrepo"", I believe it's on Netflix, if you want to get a good understanding of what it is. The book is basically describing in every possible metaphor and with science and personal experiences Morris is able to take you into the mind and maybe lets you feel what it is like dealing with this. Restrepo is about a group of soldiers that were assigned to overwatch the Koringal Valley in Afghanistan. You can see it in their faces as they speak and has to potential to open your eyes to PTSD."
ptsd,3265rx,DawnOfa_NewDay,1 point,Mon Apr 13 23:47:34 2015 UTC,"However sometimes when she's like this and her dog is in the room she will pull and immediate and jarring 180 and begin lavishing incredible amounts of vocal and physical affection on her dog and when she's finished go back to the way she was before when interacting with me.   This is a self-comforting behavior and it's how she copes. It's a good thing. (According to my therapist, who specializes in PTSD and renews my 'dog prescription' every year.)   I have a dog for my PTSD and I'd be a mess without the little guy. My partner knows by now that if I'm having a flashback and the dog isn't there: go get the dog. I recover a lot quicker with the little dude around.   Humans and men can be triggery and scary when you're vulnerable; dogs are basically the opposite of all that, plus fuzzy and warm.   Also, if it's alright for me to say so: you may really want to think about what it is about your fights that trigger her. Do you yell or raise your voice? Do you slam doors or make sudden movements? If so, kindly: you might be making things worse and should consider revising your way of handling conflict.   The dog is a good thing and the '180' is an expected and healthy thing for her to do. Well done to you for coming here to get advice and understanding."

The idea is that the light gradually gets brighter and brighter over a 15-30 minute period, simulating a natural sunrise and sort of reprogramming your brain. In general, it's helped a lot with my sleep habits. My particular clock has a beeping alarm at the end of the light cycle, but I'm usually awake well before the beep.   the clocks are kinda pricey, so you might want to shop around. there's also an iPhone app that's supposed to do something similar. I can't vouch for it, but it's cheaper than a clock if you want to try it first."

ptsd,320agr,Diggie1225,9,Thu Apr 9 15:32:39 2015 UTC,From what I've seen people generally calm down once they feel that someone understands them and thinks that how they are feeling is OK. Ironically if your boss wants people to stop crying or stop panicking probably the most unproductive way to go about it is to shame people for crying. That's going to make people who are crying feel a lot more upset rather than calming them down.  Your boss's method of managing emotions doesn't seem to be particularly effective. It seems like these are your boss's own issues that they are bringing into it. I'm guessing that it is going to backfire with not just you but a lot of people.

ptsd,31zv0b,motrinib,8,Thu Apr 9 13:30:58 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, I feel like that article misses the mark entirely on trigger warnings; they assume they are there to prevent people from looking at the material who may be triggered.  I know for me personally, this is not the case. I see a trigger warning and think to myself, okay, let's not read this on my lunch break in the office, or before meeting up with my casual acquaintance for lunch. Let me save this for a time where I am in a comfortable environment and can prepare as best as possible for a potential reaction.  I think it's important for people who are susceptible (and most importantly, people who are willing and ready) to contribute to these discussions because they have vital information to share. I don't find a trigger warning to be an avoidance issue, but more of a 'ok, prepare yourself for this!' tag.   So yeah, I don't think that article is approaching from the right angle at all and rubs me the wrong way. No one wants to be caught off guard with a flashback or breakdown but that doesn't mean everyone who experiences them practices complete avoidance either."
ptsd,31zv0b,Diggie1225,2,Thu Apr 9 16:18:25 2015 UTC,It used to be like that for me. Half the time I see a tw it comes across as pretentious...
ptsd,31zv0b,CaptainBludclot,6,Thu Apr 9 17:43:55 2015 UTC,"I had lunch with a new friend yesterday. She said that I had amazing potential in me, but that I'm as timid as a deer, and that I need to work on that. She told me that I'm great, and that I have no reason to be so timid and nervous.   I think what she is trying to communicate is that there is nothing bad about you or intrinsically wrong with you or nothing wrong with you. At the same time maybe the part she is missing (or forgot to say) is that it is OK for you to be timid and nervous and in my opinion if you survived a trauma you have good reason to feel timid and nervous. Your feelings are OK. Who wouldn't feel awful in your situation ? Feeling awful in that situation is normal.    I'm in treatment, on meds, and trying to live a normal life. I go to school Full-Time. I work, and I try to date.   That's fantastic. You can feel awful but still act like you don't. I think what you are doing is a good strategy.   Whenever I sniffle or cry, I'm told to stop pulling my victim card.   I am sorry to hear that. I'm not sure about this but these days when I hear people being critical of ""victims"" I have begun to wonder about their agenda behind this and how not wanting anyone to admit to being a victim serves their purposes, because it does serve some people's purposes (they don't want to feel the responsibility of trying to reduce the number of traumas and traumatic events in the world). I'm not sure if everyone does this with an ulterior motive but some people do.   Edit: btw On the article you posted I can see why you would find it upsetting. I found it upsetting myself when I looked at it (and I was somewhat calmed by the fact that you found it upsetting too and had essentially posted a trigger warming for it). I have mixed thoughts on the ""trigger warning"" idea. Speaking from my experience (but maybe a PTSD sufferer is the wrong person to ask ;) I can listen to very detailed descriptions of trauma and yes it is hard to hear about but I am not triggered by that. I have watched hard hitting movies about terrible tragedies and if the subject matter was dealt with compassion towards the victims I actually felt uplifted at the end.   What is triggering is hearing my trauma described in a way that makes me feel that society at large or other people are not on my side and hearing trauma described in a way that shames me and makes me feel that it is something wrong with me that made me feel this pain. For instance that article puts a lot of 'responsibility' on victims and makes it seem like what causes PTSD is something with the victims, rather than what happened to us. That is humiliating and makes a victim feel unsupported and uncared for. Also I sense that the motivation of people in writing articles like that leans towards society not taking responsibility for allowing traumatic things like wars and rapes to happen. Whether that is their intention or not (and it may not be their intention, I don't want to judge their intention) writing articles like that deflects their responsibility to change the world onto victims. Ironically having people ignore my trauma and pretend that it doesn't exist and having it be taboo to talk about is also triggering. I think that what victims would really love is for society to acknowledge our trauma in its gory detail and support us about its gory detail.   I didn't feel supported reading that article however. I feel the same as you about it."
ptsd,31zv0b,lovinglily,-4,Thu Apr 9 13:46:53 2015 UTC,"IMO it has to do with sjws and professional victims and abuse of trigger warning and the nutcases who feign PTSD as not to get negative replies to the filth they spread.. Most times when reading between the lines it is obvious most people use tw to catch attention... Fact is if you don't have it, it is not possible for you to relate to it with empathy and thus getting your struggles validated is impossible. Making it a lot worse. Hash tag activists IMO diluted and destroyed the concept.  I refuse to append tw to my posts unless forced.  I haven't read a single thing with a tw that personally triggered me.

Recently had a family member say some truly cruel things to me, when they knew I was in a very bad place. When their comments made me cry, I was accused of being ""manipulative.""  Okay. I have cut off contact with this person.  No more.  I can't help it that, like you, criticism ""hits a nerve"" in me, especially when I am really vulnerable, as I was when this occurred. I second-guessed myself for weeks, though. And in the end, I realized I didn't THINK about crying, or PLAN to cry, but the cruel comments gave me an immediate sense of being worthless. That ""worthless feeling"" is guaranteed to hit hard.  Don't worry about what one person's opinion is.

Imagine telling a paraplegic to just stand up and stop ""playing the victim card"" by sitting in a wheel chair.  Abuse and trauma can leave permanent scars and damage that have to be lived with and cannot simply be forgotten about or left behind.     If your supposed friends are hitting the same nerve as your abuser, they are not friends.  They may not really know what they are doing but if they refuse to understand and refuse to support you, then, hard as it is, you may need to find some new friends.  Sometimes even family can be toxic.  I understand the struggle with anxiety.  If you are like me, it is not something that can simply be wished away.  It can often include a physical response - adrenaline, the works.  That is not something you can just turn off.  Tears and fears cannot simply be turned off.  Find some people that you can trust and who will at least not mock or diminish your response, even if they do not know how to help you.  I don't know what the ""cure"" is, for me, I got better over time.    One thing that actually helped me a lot was to embrace what I felt rather than fight it.  That at least got rid of the shame and guilt I would feel for feeling fear.  I made it worse by being ashamed of it and that just added to my anxiety.  Instead I acknowledged whatever triggered my fear and anxiety and told myself it was OK, that my fear was understandable but then looked for what was different now.  Sometimes I had to accept crying in public if I could not find a private spot.  Believe it or not, some anger can be useful too.  Defensive anger, so long as it does not get out of control.  It got better with time.  One time that really caught me off guard was right after 9/11.  I got unexpectedly pulled aside and patted down, my butt, even between my thighs.  Being touched by a stranger like that was something that I had not experienced in many many years.  I was not prepared for it and it completely threw me.  I nearly completely collapsed, internally.  I think my response only made them more suspicious, which just worsened it.  I managed to hold it together just enough to get through and I stumbled away.  I managed to find a bathroom to sit in for a moment, I was practically catatonic by then, I was struggling so hard to hold myself together.  I wasn't even crying yet.  I was just shocked.  Fortunately, by that time, I understood enough how to ""talk"" to my internal freaking-out self, but I also had to let myself cry or I felt like I was going to get even worse and out of control.  So, it was miss my plane and cry in private or make my flight and cry on the plane.  I was also a little angry and realized, my anger was not unreasonable.  My fear was not shameful.  Anger (internally angry) helped me just go get on the plane and freely cry- people could imagine what ever they wanted.  I guess it helps that I learned to cry silently as a kid and now I can't make a sound when crying anyway so that helps when I have to cry publicly.  I hope you find some better support.  Sometimes you just need to feel what you are feeling, including crying and fear.  It is OK to feel it."

When she told me about her divorce and emotionally let me in, I told her why I couldn't date and why new men scare me. We cried together about our problems and ate hummus and watched Lord of the Rings.   For some reason I've felt better since then. Not cured. But I've felt progress that I didn't know I could.

If he starts to lose touch with reality (seeing or hearing things that are not there or becoming excessively paranoid) call the Police who can transport him to a mental health crisis center. The tricky thing about those with BPD is that many with this diagonsis make unvalidated claims of sucide. Also you can talk to him about his plan and his means to execute this plan. Talk of sucide plus a viable plan is a very dangerous situation. And honestly if you are not a veteran you likely don't completely understand how he is feeling.    This hits really close to home because I lost the love of my life, who was also a veteran, to PTSD and Bipolar five years ago.

Since he's been home,  just a few days,  things have gotten really dark.   I will look into helpline first thing tomorrow and get some tips.   Thanks for your help.   If anything else comes to mind,  please let me know."
ptsd,31yg5i,JSEdward,2,Thu Apr 9 05:38:17 2015 UTC,Definitely give the VA a call. They have ways of reaching out.
ptsd,31yg5i,AnnaBreit,2,Mon Apr 13 23:56:23 2015 UTC,"You can casually remove things like large knifes, weapons, pills (sleeping pills, muscle relaxers, and narcotics) from his house. If he is against western medicine, suggest you guys go to a mediation group together or take a yoga class, or do anything to increase his social network and support system. Also maybe look and see if your town has a vet center. These are clinics set up by the VA to help Veterns transition to civilian life. Look here http://www.vetcenter.va.gov/Vet_Center_Services.asp. Also educate yourself about BPD and Bipolar disorder and PTSD. People with BPD are VERY manuplitative (hence telling you you are the only person in their life and if you leave they will kill themselves etc). Another option is to connect him to the nonprofit The Mission Continues. This is an organization that places veterans in volunteer roles in their community to help them regain a sense of purpose. I wish it would have been around to get Greggers connected before he left this world."

I go through weeks where I feel like it's gone and I'm free of anxiety, but then the smallest thing will bring it all back and I'm right back in the middle, fighting to breathe and just be alright. But the good days outnumber the bad now and when things are going well and I'm happy, it's almost like the PTSD goes away, even if it is temporarily. It probably won't ever be perfect, but it'll get better."
ptsd,31tuv1,AitherInfinity,4,Wed Apr 8 13:07:59 2015 UTC,I don't know. 13 years since freedom and I still struggle with living everyday. 8 years clean of self harm and I still crave it everyday.

ptsd,31tuv1,MadameInternet,4,Wed Apr 8 11:19:04 2015 UTC,"It feels like fighting not to kill myself today just means I'll have to do it again tomorrow.   This is exactly right but that isn't necessarily bad, it just is. Dealing with trauma isn't like climbing a mountain; there is no apex to reach where you can declare ""I'm done!""  So keeping with that view I'd say I'm doing better. I began EMDR therapy in the fall of last year (after seeing several other councilors who basically riddled off textbook knowledge at me and sold it as therapy. ""Take time to breathe,"" ""recognize distorted thinking,"" progressive relaxation et cetera were not helpful to hear as suggestions for the millionth time since I was a child.   I am facing complex trauma as well as trauma from some separate instances of random violence. Some years ago I was drinking a liter of whiskey a day and having cigarettes for most meals, I dropped a lot of weight, couldn't get a job, wound up homeless for a minute (thankfully had friends to stay with for most of this), and so on. I don't think I could even realize how bad I felt through the disassociation, near-constant panic, and brain-fog. Though the drugs of choice changed this sort of thing went on for years and years.  Since starting EMDR in the fall there have been days where I have thought I was at the top of the mountain, that I made it. Maybe my chest pain and anxiety were lesser, maybe I managed to be present/focused for a few hours, whatever it was I saw little improvements and felt like I had made an achievement, but then the gain seemed to slip through my fingers.  I have weeks (like this past week) when I feel horrible and on edge and the week seems to drag on for months, I still have panic pretty often and am usually anxious. I still deal with this shit every day, if only for a few moments. But some days are easier than others and that didn't used to be the case.  I am getting stronger and I feel like these things that were smothering my entire life are receding little by little. Sometimes I get to feel like myself again, but its been so long it feels unfamiliar.  So it hasn't gotten easy, it hasn't really gotten good, but it is getting better. I don't think this fight will ever end, but I'm trying to make it easier; I'm hoping that eventually it might not be so hard to get up and do it all again tomorrow and then I can be me again."
ptsd,31tuv1,alush,4,Wed Apr 8 19:00:24 2015 UTC,"For me it is cyclical. Every once and awhile I get really really really fucking down in the dumps. But mostly I live my life now, no therapy, no drugs, no nothing. Just me living my life.   Feels good, feels freeing. I spent a very long time overcoming this. I witnessed violence when I was younger that most combat veterans I have talked to shudder when I explain it.   Now, I am just me. Living my life, free from the shackles of the terrors in my own mind.   Goodluck OP, for some of us it DOES get better. I don't spread false hope that yes, 100% it will get better for you. But for me it did. Hope that might give you some comfort."

ptsd,31tuv1,lovinglily,2,Wed Apr 8 22:23:40 2015 UTC,"It became more manageable for me. I have more good days and fewer bad ones. But I live in a very peaceful place, good neighbors, rural, quiet at night, and I live alone.  If I lived in a frenetic city or with other people, or close to volatile neighbors, it might be different. I also now work from home, which helps me avoid encounters with cruel or thoughtless people that might trigger episodes.  When I do have good days, it feels so awesome. When I have bad days, I hurt, but not a bad. And like alliOops said, the worst day now is like heaven compared to the days I've endured.

He did not want to go then so we ended up leaving when he was tired. Then tonight happened. We have plans to attend the opening day baseball game which involves a signifigant amount of drinking on our part. Our DD had to back out of the game due to family issues. The BF who is such a control freak and can't handle change flips out about how he does not know how things are going to work out and does not want to take the cooler on public transit and so on. When I try to talk to him about plans he snaps back at me about how he was trying to forget about things. I, again, am super triggered, and am reminded about how bad he makes me feel.

ptsd,31nwfc,icanseethestars,3,Mon Apr 6 22:36:02 2015 UTC,Seroquel is an absolute dream if you want to be unconscious. So if you're in the stage where you can't function and you need to just sleep- it's great. But long term you become a zombie.
ptsd,31nwfc,TheShittyBeatles,2,Mon Apr 6 22:41:34 2015 UTC,"I was prescribed Seroquel, but I had to stop taking it after only a few weeks. It made me way too tired to be able to think or function normally, and the effects of one dose would linger for two or three days. On the plus side, it never shut down my metabolism like other medications did (Abilify, etc.) and it actually worked pretty well. If I were retired or didn't leave the house or drive very much, I would probably take it, but the side effects are just too much.  Right now, I'm on a high dose of Librax, which is a combined anxiolytic and spasmolytic (for PTSD-related IBS), and it also has pretty bad side effects just like Seroquel. But they're a lot more manageable and only last for a few hours at a time. I can't do too much caffeine because it triggers my IBS, so I only drink a little black tea in the morning and make sure I get a good amount of my daily calories from sugars and carbs (limited to 1800 calories per day, if/when I can help it).  I'm still waiting on a better medication with fewer side effects. I have an appointment next week, so hopefully I'll get to try something new. Good luck to you."

ptsd,31o5se,tpm_,3,Mon Apr 6 20:54:30 2015 UTC,"Well stress all by itself can make symptoms worse, and having a stressor that relates thematically to some of the issues surrounding your father's suicide, makes it that much more important.  FWIW, last night I had another one of my recurring ""stress"" dreams because for work, I was sure that I had blown up a whole bank of servers after the office server racks had to be unplugged for a building wide scheduled power outage.  It seems when my brain realized that I was trapped, I think it started to play the tapes of growing up in the city, in the summer, not having anywhere to go or do - but hearing gunfire and sirens almost all night long.    From my experience - where I'm a counseling student that has taken years of training towards trauma related issues, is that relapses are completely normal and just indicate that not all of the roots to the trauma have been completed worked through.  It is possible that some symptoms will return for a time, and yes more therapeutic intervention is likely needed, but it will most likely be easier as some relief has already been found.  Your body/somatosensory systems knows there's a way out which they didn't previously.  To go into more detail, it sounds as if the Fight or Flight response is replaying a tape it learned through parental modeling, and then the reward center is just waiting for anything to get close to fulfilling the result of that tape.  In addition, it sounds as if there may be an additional message that is triggering this around the concept of ""if this happened to Dad, then maybe I'm next"" or something like that.  Whatever the messages are, it just sounds like a new level to explore, and being a fellow traveler that has also come from an alcoholic background, there is likely lots of subtle trauma that has occurred that is feeding these traumas as well.  For instance, I'm just now realizing that the alcoholism and narcissism was shared by the entirety of my family, not just my parents.  My trapped feelings, have been valid for my whole extended family.  I was made to feel wrong and bad, because I could feel something was wrong and was always told - it was me.  This is a new realization after being successful, having a job that pays a good salary in IT, working on my counseling degree, basically becoming the success I've always dreamed of.  I feeling some new feelings coming back, and they suck, but I've been through it enough to know - its just another trip around the shit show that is my family.  It's not internal to me - I just don't know it yet.  Well, this may have been a ramble, but I'm not going to censor - so you can experience whatever truth there is to offer in the post.  It sounds like the MDMA delivered some success.  It might be time to do some deeper emotional work of which I recommend somatic approaches - EMDR / Somatic Experiencing / Trauma Yoga / Experiential type techniques where at all possible.  Those are what worked for me at any rate."

It has taken me a long time (just turned 53) but I am finally living with the past and doing OK.  In my case, ""releasing it into the void that is the internet"" has helped a lot.  More than I ever would have thought.  Ranting on r/atheism, r/christianity, r/debate religion and similar subs, and arguing with theists (admittedly, occasionally raging at theists) was surprisingly cathartic.     I have even had the opportunity to ""talk"" to (and rage at) pedophiles who tried to defend pedophilia and tell them exactly what I thought of pedophiles and their claim of ""loving children"".  I told them what it felt like from the perspective of the child and what happens when the child grows up to be an adult.  I was able to metaphorically ""slap"" them for the toxic nonsense they spew.   It felt satisfying to call them (both theists and pedophiles) on their bullshit and in a venue where I had complete control of my involvement in the interaction.  I could participate or not.  I could stay or go as I wanted.  If it was too much I could just shut the computer or ignore that red envelop (or click it and close to make it no longer red!).  Additionally, silly humor (like all the hated and maligned memes) helped me defuse my uncontrolled fear/anxiety responses to religious imagery and helped replace it with giggles.  Reddit was a real life ""Ridikulous!"" charm spell for me."

And no one stood up for us. It's depressing that bad people do terrible things but it's even more disturbing when good people do nothing about it. That kind of thing, there are always people who know its happening and don't want to get involved. They decided that being uncomfortable superseded the physical and emotional wellbeing of an innocent child. That is what angers me."
ptsd,31lq1w,Sysiphuslove,6,Mon Apr 6 18:16:18 2015 UTC,"That used to make me so fucking angry. I coped by being angry. DCFS knew about what went on in my house because I did what they tell you to do, I told a counselor at school, but they made appointments when they came to 'check up' and my mother collaborated with my pedo stepfather to get him out of the house on the rare, scheduled occasion that DCFS came by. Who else do you tell?   The failure to appear of a savior, of someone to stand up for the internal dignity and innocence of a kid who can't help himself, that's collapse-inducing in itself. There is a kind of illusion that people who have never been through a true nightmare have the luxury of; that someone will help, will stand up for you, will protect you, that mercy or pity will make an attacker retreat, that safety can be found in good behavior or obedience or supplication or careful attention to protocol, that you can help yourself. Those things become internalized in fortunate children and make of them competent adults.   This is a really difficult thread, isn't it"

It could've been his substance abuse problem, or the domestic violence and abuse that permeated from it, and having to flee to a refuge. Maybe it was the kids at school who molested me unintentionally, or the classmate who forced himself on me in a disabled toilet. Hell it could've been the bullying, my mother saying horrible things to me and being physically abusive or even my brother being a really violent person.

ptsd,31lq1w,poop_dawg,9,Mon Apr 6 21:18:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks for making this thread. I think it's a great idea.  I don't remember most of it. After years and years of dealing with it and learning and years of therapy I still don't. Maybe I never will. It is strange to have something so defining, dictating so much of my life so far in the dark. Oh well...  What I do know is, that during or shortly after my parents divorce my dad molested me. I was somewhere around 8 to 10, not yet pubescent at all. The clearest, most complete memory fragment is of presumably the first, probably least bad time. As I was taking a bath, he came in all weird and - as I now understand - horny. At the time I had no way of grasping sexuality. I know he groped me and jerked off into my bath. Then he just left the bathroom. I was terrified of his cum. It floated ever so slowly toward me. When I tried to make a current away from me with my hands, it just came at me faster. I ""sacrificed"" my leg and managed to dilute it into invisibility. I just sat there and stayed in the bath until the water was cold. Then I had to poop. I held it in until, well, I pooped in the bath. Eventually my dad came back and took me out and cleaned up. To this day I am terrified of anything slimy and bathtubs.  I know from very small memory fragments, that at some point I had trouble breathing with a cock in my mouth. It was so freaken big. I have no idea whether it was ""just"" these two times or if it went on for years.  I blacked it all out very thoroughly. I remember my mum asking me if something had happened. She did an excellent job. I knew nothing bad would come of me talking and this was very important and all that. Only I had blacked it out. I had no way of knowing anything had happened. So I kept visiting him every other weekend.  My mum tried her best, but she was way out of her depth. With the divorce and becoming a single mum and everything I became her partner. She'd unload on me and I would play my part acting way too grown up. It was the only way to get intimacy, closeness - protection. I still struggle with that relationship. I also was my dads partner, parent almost. I did everything to help him get better. He was seriously depressed and suffered from anxieties and I don't know (or care) what. Obviously I couldn't help. So much energy and love went into trying to help him. Yet he never wanted help, just pity and control. He certainly never wanted to change or work on himself. He was content broadcasting his ""victimness"" and manipulating people.  At school and everywhere really I withdrew. Went from very talkative to silent observer. I became a very strange kid. Moving like a robot and apparently devoid of feelings. As kids are they prodded and teased me. I would take it and become even stiffer, so they would keep at it. Eventually I would burst into a fit of nearly uncontrollable rage. It became a sport for them. It was a terrible time. Only when I refused to go to school anymore it got taken seriously enough. Some parents talked to their kids and a really big kid from my class offered me protection. I still remember the relief. It was wonderful.  E: It feels good having posted that. It helps me see that it really is something."

First time I got a 2x4 to the head was when I couldn't start the lawnmower when I was in 3rd grade.   I was kicked out of my dad and step-moms house at 15 and spent years homeless and couch-surfing when/where I could.  I had a child, and his mother refused access for about two and a half years. (She has since apologized profusely, and done her best to ""make it up to me"", and I've raised him since he was 4, he's now 10)  Most recently, though, and the part that actually led to my official diagnosis was finding my fiancee after she hanged herself from a tree in our backyard with an extension cord.

ptsd,31lq1w,lovinglily,6,Mon Apr 6 20:40:28 2015 UTC,"sexual abuse as a child, mainly. it happened from when I was about 7 or 8, until my late teens.   I'm the 4th of 6 kids. brothers 2 and 3 both molested me (they are about 7 and 5 years older than me, respectively). with brother 2 it was outright rape on at least two occasions; he was sadistic and threatened to kill me if I ever told anyone. there were also several incidents with an older neighbor boy (~5 years older than me), and a male cousin (3 or 4 years older than me). and some sexual inappropriateness from my mother, too. like most people commenting, my memories are spotty.  brother 2 used to take me into the shower at home, and I was so petrified of the group showers in gym class that I was able to get a doctor's waiver for the class.  I flunked out of high school, and got my GED a year or two later.   brothers 2 and 3 moved out, got married, etc, when I was about 10 to 14 years old.  but there was at least one abusive incident with each of them after they got married. I think they were sort of claiming me as their property, so to speak. both brothers actively discouraged my dating life as I got older.   I read compulsively, a book a day sometimes. it was partly a coping mechanism: activate my intellect to distract from the overwhelming emotional pain. I never drank or used drugs.   I'm a straight guy, but I didn't date a lot because I was absolutely terrified of anyone touching me in a sexual manner. I went through alternating phases of masturbating several times a day, to periods when I had no sexual desire for months on end. I couldn't eat bananas because they reminded me of an erect penis.   my dad was a very sweet, very hardworking man. but he was passive and dominated by my mother, who was probably a narcissist. when I was young he worked a lot of overtime and wasn't home very much. there was alcoholism and serious mental illness histories in both their families.  only at about 19/20 years old did I start to understand what happened, that it was wrong and abusive, and that it had all messed with me in a big way. not until my late 30s did I get any really effective help from a therapist with a specialty in trauma/EMDR and a good understanding of personality disorders in families. and that was after two nervous breakdowns in my early 30s, one of which should have led to my hospitalization. I dated a girl for a few months, fell madly in love with her because she seemed to really like me. then she used me to get even with her exboyfriend and refused to talk to me. I almost killed myself.   a lot of therapists discounted my memories, even implying that I was imagining things or was in denial about my homosexuality. there are very, very few resources for men who were sexually abused as children and many therapists don't know how to handle us. I tried a few support groups, but they were so steeped in radical feminist men-are-abusers dogma that it was obvious that they really didn't want me attending.   on the good side, I've been lucky enough to hold a decent job for over a decade. and I've married an amazing woman who's been very patient with my PTSD issues.   on the bad side, my parents cut most of my siblings out of the will. I am by far the most stable, responsible and level-headed of their kids. I'm also the only one who was in regular contact with my parents during the final decade of their lives. and after both my parents were dead, 4 of my 5 siblings discovered they were disinherited. they IMMEDIATELY went on the offensive against me. brother 2 physically attacked me, my sisters made false accusations of abuse against me. and after I filed the will for probate, they forged a will that left me a tiny portion of the estate. it was an obvious forgery, and I had enough evidence to challenge it and the judge ruled it was a forgery. but the shock of my dad's sudden death, and the vicious attacks on me personally, triggered a major flareup in PTSD symptoms that I'm still coping with.   edit: I should also add that both my younger sisters probably have borderline personality disorder and/or bipolar. they regularly physically attacked me from the time we were very young, slapping and shoving me and pulling my hair, often for no reason I could determine. I'd be hiding in my room and reading, when one of them would barge in and start yelling incoherently at me, throwing things at me, and then slapping my face a few times before storming out. then later that day, they'd act like nothing was wrong and remind me, so kindly, that one of my favorite TV shows was on tonight and asking if I wanted to watch it with them.   occasionally I'd retaliate, shoving them or hitting back. they'd immediately start acting shocked and like they were the victim. it was bewildering.   tl;dr: most of my family is profoundly mentally ill."

In the back of my mind, I have this idea that there is something very dark inside of me. I feel it is powerful. Some days I feel it will be the destruction of me, those days I feel it in my chest. The best way I was ever able to describe it was saying it felt like I was dying. Feels like a hard ball in my chest, and it must have its own gravity because it feels like everything around it is sinking into it.  But then there are other days, where I feel it, but it feels like the ball is expanding trying to push it's way out of my chest. These days I'm quick to anger, but I'm afraid of my anger, because it feels like I just have this intense darkness just waiting inside of me and if I let it take over I'll just go into destruction mode and start tearing everything around me down, breaking things and being hurtful with my words to people.    Whatever it is, I feel like it has power to overwhelm what control I have and that one day it will either destroy me, or I'll break and turn into some horrible monster and sink to some place where I become a completely cold person who is only out to harm others.  When I feel like I'm dying, nothing really seems to be able to help me, no distraction good enough. But when I feel that anger, like I'm going to become whatever it is trapped inside me, I need distraction to sate it. Those times where I can do nothing, when I was working and had no choice but to wait for people to come in where the worst, my anger just grew and grew and with no healthy distraction I felt like I'd blow up on people, and everything pissed me off.   In these times my imagination runs wild, acting out so many things. I can relate to opening your eyes and they are still there. I have that problem, my eyes can be open but I can visualize things that I wish would just go away but they can be distracting.

ptsd,31htbr,LittleBlueEyes,3,Sun Apr 5 05:41:39 2015 UTC,"Trauma affects people in really weird ways... What may be just a normal day for one person could be another's emotional undoing. It's all about perspective, and many become numb to the possibility of someone else's struggle in order to unconsciously protect themselves from feeling intense pain. You're doing the same thing, but to yourself instead of another person. I can think of millions who have had a worse upbringing than I did, and I used to feel terrible about my own trauma, even with the support of others. I thought I was well-adjusted, but I was just severely repressed and had a persona until it was safe to experience my own PTSD.   What you experienced was traumatic for you, and with trauma, there is no comparison with what we feel inside, because no one ever has the exact same experience as anyone else, and if they're trying to compare your experience with others, they have their own demons to work with. You deserve care, love, respect, and healing as much as anyone else, and healing that trauma is the only thing that matters. No therapist worth their salt should EVER make you feel less for experiencing the aftershock of trauma, and it's common to have the guilt about the diagnosis itself.   Guilt is a terrible monster. I've felt my own share of it. I was numb to it for so long, didn't start having flashbacks until after I moved out of my home after a decade of sexual abuse. I came from a family that was the ""pull yourself up with your bootstraps"" thing, but I project a very happy and easy-going persona. When I started to tell people about my PTSD, they would brush it off, thinking it wasn't serious because to them, I seemed so incredibly well-adjusted. That involved pushing a hell of a lot down, though, in order to function and throw people off the scent. I'm getting better now, though it's so hard. With love, support, and courage, you will recover, too. It just takes time.  If you need to talk about anything at all, please don't hesitate to shoot me a PM. Support is vital, especially during the beginning of therapy. It takes time, go at your own pace. You are loved, and you are not alone."

It doesn't matter how severe the trauma itself was in any absolute physical sense, just your emotional reaction to it. NICU trauma has an extremely powerful emotional context, amplified by pregnancy hormones, so it absolutely can cause PTSD. That kind of trauma ends a lot of marriages due to the triggers associated with having another child.  PTSD is pathologically self-reinforcing. If you don't get treatment, it may actually get worse.

I'm in the same boat; I don't feel like I've experienced things ""traumatic"" enough to justify it. I feel like I should just suck it up and push through it. Lately though, things have been triggering more often.   More and more often I've been thinking about my own family's deaths. I catch myself writing eulogies in my head and grieving like they're already dead and I'm beginning to realize how NOT normal that is. I compare the people important to me to patients I've lost. I don't have any guilt over the lost ones; I've never had a situation where there was anything I could have done to save them. It's like it's an exaggerated sense of the fragility of life; only it's starting to interfere with actually living it.   I guess what I'm saying is I know the feeling; especially when you talk about comparing yourself to others and their ""trauma"". I have a history in 12 step programs, being a child of an alcoholic, so what's helped most with that is to realize, at least for me, how much of that is our own ego. That, somehow, I think that I should be so much better than the average person that experiencing trauma, extreme stress for extended periods of time, and constant (or constant readiness for) life and death situations (maybe not our own, but being responsible for someone else's), that these things should just roll off our shoulders and not cause any lasting effect. For me, this is the most egotistical thing about me. I feel like I should be better than everyone. I should be able to take it all in stride and move past it. When I step back, and look at everything I ""take in stride"", I realize that PTSD, or some form thereof, is almost inevitable. My gut reaction is to take this as a failure, then I get caught up in self-shaming. It's different knowing it's not a failure, and another to truly believe it.

Still, it can be reassuring when you know the other person really does know something about it.     (all this stuff can be applied to each of you, or to both )  For now, it sounds like both of you are in an early stage of treatment.   You are functioning, but not yet good at talking about things - especially with each other.   If you feel comfortable, talk with your psych professionals about bringing the other person to a session once in a while.   In the controlled environment,  seeing what the other shares and how they respond to support might be helpful.    Just be sure to both agree - no criticism or comparing how you get treatment to the other's time.      Since you both are having symptoms, you both need to have a support network.  At least a professional for treatment, and possibly more than one person to call when things get unbearable.   You (each) can barely hold together all the pain from your own traumas - until you are well along the road healing, you won't be able to offer healthy support to each other. It might be nice to agree - for now - to either not talk to each other about stuff that could trigger you..   or maybe have a simple sign or word that means "" I still care deeply about you, but sharing this stuff is just too emotionally overwhelming right now. ""    You both may need to agree/  or accept permission to cut the other one off.    If both of you wind up in a panic or depressed state, then  it just hurts 2x as many people.    If one of you wants to vent, but cannot... one of you has your feelings hurt but you can get through tomorrow together.   Remember the basics of relationships, especially if you spend a lot of time together.   Care for the other person, they don't owe you anything more than respect.

ptsd,31ec7a,Lonzy,9,Sat Apr 4 06:38:50 2015 UTC,"You have to explain it. Don't delve too much at once if you don't want to, it might be more than either of you are prepared to deal with. Say it matter of fact, ""I owe you an explanation for my freak out. I was sexually assaulted about 5 years ago and carry ptsd from it. Getting stuck between the bed and the wall brought up panic and a flashback. I'm sorry I didn't tell you and it wasn't your fault. I don't feel threatened by you and I'm happy. I just don't like getting pinned. I hope you understand.""  I came from a very abusive family (not sexually) and when I first got together with my husband, he raised his hand to brush his hair back and I flinched and covered my face. Then I started crying. ""I thought you were going to hit me."" I said. And he hugged me and asked ""Why in the world would I hit you?"" ""No reason."" I said. And he immediately understood. I used to get hit for no reason. Not just hit, beat to shit. Your response scared him too. And he should know why. Again, don't give any details you don't want to. But if you love him, tell him.   Sorry so long."
ptsd,31ec7a,CosmicPube,6,Sat Apr 4 08:43:22 2015 UTC,"So sorry for what you've been through.  I know where you're coming from, and there's the added panic when the person is still trying to be playful and doesn't understand you may hurt them with the bad reaction to the flashback.  It all is melded into one stupid experience.  Had a large friend jokingly keep trying to pick me up and throw me in the ocean. My primitive brain was going to do something to really hurt her, while my friend brain was saying ""please stop, please stop, I'm going to hurt you, please stop.""  She wouldn't give up, until my sister-in-law, who was my best friend at the time,  got concerned and said, ""She means it. You need to stop.""  You don't want to hurt people you care about, but some activities you can't just take in fun, as much as you wish you could."
ptsd,31ec7a,grundyhippie,4,Sat Apr 4 11:49:50 2015 UTC,"Lonzy - It can be hard for people to really understand.  Especially since one of the most difficult things for many PTSD sufferers is to speak about it in any way without the fear of triggering it.  I had a horrible ""freak out"" (using your words) on the 3rd date with the woman who is now my wife.  It is possible to have a relationship and for your SO to understand.  And at some point for that SO to help you with this.  That may be a long way away but know that it is possible.  Be well Lonzy"

ptsd,31duhv,sayhitothehobo,5,Sat Apr 4 03:11:07 2015 UTC,"I think it matters less what your diagnosis is, and more that you have symptoms which are making it impossible to lead a normal life. Treat those symptoms as well as you can, and worry about finding the right label later. If the nightmares and lack of sleep are causing the trouble right now, then try fixing that first, and don't worry about claiming the PTSD diagnosis. You don't have to tell anyone anyway.   The thing I don't have is a traumatizing experience to tie it to PTSD. Nothing really stands out at all. Of course I also have a really horrible memory, I have almost no memory of my childhood at all. My parents tell me I had a good childhood and I have to believe them. Most of what I remember conflicts with their versions and honestly, one of us has a long history of forgetting stuff and it's not them haha.   You don't have to believe your parents' version of things. For all they know, you did have a good childhood, but that doesn't mean they know everything that happened to you, or how things really affected you emotionally. The fact that you have almost no memory of your childhood is a little worrisome. The little 'haha' at the end makes me think there's a long history of your parents either refusing to believe you, or minimizing your experiences and feelings.   I think people are often too quick to dismiss bullying as 'just kids being kids', when it's really doing damage. Also, keep in mind that no matter how traumatic events are, when you're a kid, they're just normal. You have no context to put it in, or the perspective to be able to see how not normal other people would see them."
ptsd,31duhv,Digiopian,2,Sat Apr 4 03:53:41 2015 UTC,I was misdiagnosed for a couple of years with bipolar. I took medicines that made me sick and never helped me and eventually it led me to a few suicidal attempts and a lot of hospital stays. I let the doc convince me she was right. I now  educate myself as much as possible before I even consider trying something new. That was pretty stressful I guess but I was having nightmares and problems long before that. That was probably only 3 years ago. My youngest memories as a child are nightmares like this.   I don't trust my parents but I don't trust myself either. I imagine that the true version was probably worse than what they think but better than what I remember. Plus since I really can't prove it what's the point of accusing people? Especially when they pay all your bills. Honestly the most suspicious evidence is that I only mentioned it once and my father became really defensive. I usually become really defensive when I am lying.
ptsd,31duhv,tallgirl32,3,Sat Apr 4 09:36:14 2015 UTC,"I definitely can't say either way whether or not you have PTSD, but I can tell you that there are events that happen in life that your reptilian brain perceives as traumatic that your logical, conscious brain doesn't even register. I sort of liken it to how two different people can experience the exact same event, and one gets PTSD while the other does not. The brain is squirrely and complex.   Who knows what has happened in your life that your brain took issue with? If you have heard the same thing regarding PTSD from numerous people, including a therapist you really like and respect, maybe it's an idea that is at least worth considering?"
ptsd,31duhv,CareflulWithThatAxe,1 point,Sat Apr 4 03:57:46 2015 UTC,Ya i am considering it. Like I said the symptoms fit. Sometimes they are scarily accurate.
ptsd,31duhv,rewardiflost,2,Sat Apr 4 09:38:55 2015 UTC,"Heck it also fits with schizophrenia, bi-polar, or just generalized depression.    The symptoms you describe actually don't fit those diagnoses. Perhaps depression, but not really: if you look at the DSM (Diagnostic Statistic Manual), each of the diagnoses you list have other, much more salient criteria. Sure, as a consequence of having hallucinations or delusions, a person with schizophrenia may socially withdraw, for instance, or lack focus, but that withdrawal is not part of the primary symptomology.   Those symptoms aren't even part of the primary symptomology of PTSD, aside from anxiety, in the sense that PTSD is essentially an anxiety disorder, and a bad memory, if your bad memory is akin to a dissociation -- your brain protecting itself from remembering something traumatic. (Sometimes people just don't remember their childhoods, though; I have an ex who doesn't have PTSD or any mental health issue, but has absolutely no memory of most of his early years.)  There aren't really any blood tests. The current state of psychology and psychiatry is such that diagnoses arise from clinical symptoms, with the exception of personality disorders, the diagnoses of which often also rely on questionnaires. (Sometimes questionnaires are used to track anxiety and depression symptoms over time, but frequently the diagnoses just come from clinical symptoms.)  I'd just keep working with your psychiatrist's suggestions and try not to focus on the diagnosis, as others have advised. But it may be helpful to know that PTSD is regarded as a condition arising from biology meeting environment: it's thought that those who end up with PTSD have a biological predisposition, if you'd like, that gets triggered by a traumatic event. Perhaps you're dealing with a biological predisposition and no real triggering event, and this predisposition constitutes a sensitivity to everyday events that manifests in your sleep. But perhaps you do have something in your past obscured by bad memory. I'd not focus on that, though.  What's important is just straightening out your sleep and other issues. Medication is frequently prescribed outside of the purposes for which it was originally marketed or developed, so even if you don't have PTSD, the medication your psychiatrist prescribed should help you.   Good luck!"
ptsd,31duhv,rewardiflost,1 point,Sat Apr 4 07:22:43 2015 UTC,Well I just meant that those things have the same symptoms not that they are they only symptoms. A huge symptom of ptsd is a traumatic event that I cannot give.   I do think I am anxious and I have taken one pill for that for a while.  But again I have never noticed an improvement or difference at all making me less open to the idea of more pills .    Most of these pills have side effects that are worse than what they are treating.  If they didn't I wouldn't have any problems with just taking whatever the doctor prescribed. But that got me into a lot of trouble a few years ago and almost ended up killing me. I require a lot more evidence and research into something new now. If I could be garenteed that these pills would help then I wouldn't care if I was diagnosed with ptsd or not.  But you can never have those garentees so I am trying to get as much information as possible.

It's hard to empathize without experiencing it yourself, as I'm sure you know.    The fact that they have ties and sympathies to the abuse inhibits their abilities even further.  I, personally,  have qualms with placing blame upon the ones I love.  I imagine that they may feel the same,  and are rationalizing against any progress. Your step-father has a really interesting dynamic in this.  Please try to be as patient with them as you can,  the situation is fucking dense.   I, recently, have started EMDR which has taught me a very insightful piece of science that I'd like to share that may be helpful in explaining: Trauma is kept in the right hemisphere of the brain and your concept of time is kept in the left hemisphere.

You're also right about their sympathies. When I decided to no longer be in contact with my step father, my mom supported me because she had just devorced him and she knew how awful he was. But I can't expect her to completely turn away from her child. And part of why I never really talked to her about the abuse is I didn't want to seem like I was trying to turn her against my brother. But on the other hand, I am her child too and I still want my mom to back me up and take care of me. It's a very emotionally complicated situation for all of us.  As far as her new husband goes, by the time they got married I was already an adult living on my own far away from them, so he just hadn't been around long enough to see why my brother and I have such a toxic relationship. I've severely limited my contact with my brother and so he's only seen me avoid him a lot, never a full-blown fight.   I feel like I heard that fact at some point and then forgot about it, but it is definitely useful and I will bring that up also whenever I talk about it with them.

Basically how they work is they give me a call for $55 to interview me on my situation, my circumstances, what I'm looking for, all that jazz, and then they find a therapist who will best suit my needs. They then find that therapist to call me back, and then I go from there. It was very interesting, and although I didn't talk much, I'm hoping for the best. Finding a therapist would be hard though, because when I did Google search the ones in my area, I was bombarded with so many. Actually I shouldn't done more research regarding selectcounsellors, it was rather impulsive, but I think it was worth it in the end. I really want to find one that I can connect with.  Thank-you for your concern. My only regret now is wishing I had dealt with my emotions earlier. It let to so much problems and mental illnesses. I noticed your username, you have my sympathies.

But if they ask for specifics you can always say you don't want to discuss details and avoid telling them it's not combat related. They're so many different things that ""count"" as traumatic. It's a bit sad people have to be such twits sometimes.   I used Heroin instead of alcohol, but what really helped was structured therapy with psychedelics. Not for everyone obviously. But then all that was undone in one go when I agreed to try out a different type of medication from my doc. I had such a nasty reaction to it that almost all my symptoms came back scaled up and full force.   I've been picking up the pieces albeit slowly. I don't really know what to say. I restructured how I think to work around poor memory and executive functioning. It also helps me filter out and label irrational and/or objectively unimportant things that feel like the only thing that matters when you're in that state. And all that is OK. I finally found a therapist who can work with me functionally. She specializes in EMDR and play therapy. You may want something more along those lines. CBT never worked for me. I'm not exaclty comfortable discussing details in a public post but feel free to PM me."
ptsd,314x7m,thrown_future,1 point,Thu Apr 2 02:13:20 2015 UTC,"I was just diagnosed yesterday, but in reality, I've had it for ten years. I just FINALLY had the courage to talk about what happened to me to a psychiatrist myself and, after that, FINALLY had a mental health professional actually listen to me and take me seriously. I've been seeing a wonderful therapist since January and I have very high hopes for my new psychiatrist now. Mine is also non-combat-related. Mine was the result of a sexual assault combined with 18 years in a church that was in all actuality a religious cult. Both are heavily tied. The only ""blessing"", I guess, is that now that I'm being taken seriously and what I've been dealing with actually has a name, I can actually get the help I need.  I also turned to alcohol years ago. I just wanted something to shut off the hell that was my reality. It almost killed me, so I decided, the night I nearly died on a bathroom floor, that I would live if for nothing else to piss off my former church's followers. You have to hang on to something! I'm proud to say I have been sober for almost 13 years. I won't, however, tell you that quitting is easy if you have an emotional tie to alcohol (or anything else) and if you have an emotional health condition on top of it all. It's hell. There are some days all these years later where I have to stay away from the liquor aisle at all costs or I'll fall right off the damn wagon.  I wish I could tell you what the magic fix to surviving this is, but I can't. Hell, I wish I knew for my own purposes. What I seem to have found out though is that with PTSD versus even other mental health conditions, the experiences are very, very unique. I can't go into detail about it, but one of my triggers is a certain breakfast food. It majorly reminds me of the last night I was with the man who assaulted me. Another person I know couldn't be around a certain fast food chain for years. So, from what I can tell about this new journey is that it's so unique that you can't follow any pre-determined path.  I can say this: You are not alone. I've experienced so much of what you have experienced too. My circumstances are different, but I can relate still. So please know you're not alone as you struggle with this.  I have yet to try this myself, but my therapist recommended Smart Recovery in case you're interested. Because I have issues with religion, I needed something that was secular and strictly evidence-based. I just haven't gotten around to finding a group. I'm in school and very, very busy! I was told they have online groups in case you physically can't get to one, either. So, if you feel like you might want some help with substance abuse, that might be a good route."
ptsd,315ppu,pearspears,3,Thu Apr 2 04:49:46 2015 UTC,"You need to see a doctor about this. The internet isn't a good place to ask. There is such a wide range of symptoms for PTSD as well as schizophrenia, and same with side-effects of taking any medications. Nevertheless, here's my suggestion to you..instead of focusing on what might be wrong and just swimming in fear and uncertainty...focus on what you can do to make things work. For example...you are recognizing something is not working, so I would suggest to you that that is a very very healthy sign, and not a sign of schizophrenia. But whether you have it...I would make very sure to take a log of your symptoms. Write them down. So that when you do see a doctor, you aren't going to be tempted to bow to suggestion but show them the list. I at least know this is one of my problems. If you write things down, they won't bug you as much, maybe. Also let me tell you right now, going onto an anti-psychotic for any reason, is not something you want ever unless you really are schizophrenic or other medications aren't working. Can I ask you how much physical contact you get daily? (Like hugs, or intimacy, or petting an animal?) Also, you might be suffering from some sort of dietary issue - and the problem with malnutrition is that it is a downward spiral. You don't feel like eating - you don't eat- you feel sicker - you eat less - you are anxious due to malnourishment - you eat less. And malnourishment makes you have insomnia, as well as causes all kinds of mental disruption, up to hallucinations ""desert mirages"", severe panic, sluggish thinking, jumbled thoughts, short term memory loss, vertigo etc. So my suggestion to you is by yourself some chicken broth and saltine crackers and plenty of juice you like and force yourself to eat...very slowly. You probably have low calcium, low vitamin d, low zinc, low magnesium, low l-tryptophan (precursor to serotonin), low potassium, low omega 3s etc. All these things are absolutely critical for energy, calmness, memory, sleep and happiness. If you take supplements, make sure you eat food with them. And if you choose to take any supplements at all, make sure you use whole food ones only - a good brand is Standard Process. Get yourself some broth stat. And try to avoid caffeine and sugar.   The truth is, this is incredibly common for students these days. They have found that the amount of stress US students have (anyway- don't know if you are in the us) is equal to the stress that prisoners have on death row. That's right. And the stress you have, that you aren't able to care for (and is made worse by PTSD) is being transferred into your body in the form of a lack of appetite, and then that lack of appetite leads to malnourishment and that leads to more stress, and that leads to more lack of appetite etc. BTW, you don't have to be thin to be malnourished. Any form of starvation of the body, even if you aren't thin, takes a toll on you."
ptsd,315ppu,theaftstarboard,2,Thu Apr 2 05:58:55 2015 UTC,thank you for your help
ptsd,315ppu,theaftstarboard,1 point,Thu Apr 2 19:04:58 2015 UTC,"No problem. I actually had severe malnutrition once, and let me tell you, I thought I was dying and going crazy at the same time. I was eating, but not enough (I was having 2 meals a day but working 12 hour shifts in summer heat) but it never occurred to me that that was the problem, and when this went on for long enough I ended up with hyperkalemia which is extremely low potassium levels. My symptoms were vertigo, severe anxiety, jumbled thoughts, auras, short term memory loss and severe fatigue. I ended up going to the ER not knowing what was wrong and they gave me an iv of fluids and that cleared it right up. And like I said, I was eating bananas, drinking etc...just not enough. And when the body goes below a certain level, you can truly need emergency care before you get back up again, as everything shuts down and even if you eat, it doesn't get better. And absolutely the mind is affected by what you eat or don't eat. Not to freak you out or anything, but please make sure you hydrate with water and eat high protein and high vegetables. If you are having insomnia, try turkey before bedtime, avoid using the computer, and avoid any caffeine after 12pm. Turkey has high levels of l-tryptophan, which is the precursor to serotonin, which makes you calm and tired. Taking adequate tryptophan from whole foods sources is even more important if you are taking an SSRI, because the SSRI might not work properly."
ptsd,315ppu,theaftstarboard,2,Thu Apr 2 22:50:55 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much. I have a very weird schedule. I am trying to eat better and my boyfriend helps, but do you think vitamins can help in the short term until I learn to eat better long term?"
ptsd,315ppu,theaftstarboard,1 point,Fri Apr 3 00:57:32 2015 UTC,"My recommendations (of course, I'm not a doctor, but this is what I take) are omega 3 fish oil (liquid form - if you take gel caps break a few open and drip the liquid into soup or cereal), carrot juice (vitamin a), orange juice (vitamin c), vitamin d3 in liquid form and calcium lactate (5:1 - calcium magnesium ration from standard process.) If you think you might be anemic, go to rite aid and ask for liquid ferrous solution from behind the counter (iron for anemic babies, its prescription free but they keep it behind the counter - you might get a funny look - just tell them your anemic) and take about 3 capfuls of that a day (it tastes awful tho, warning you). I can't offer you a fast solution for your appetite, but I have found those powdered vita c supplements to be really good for when I am feeling too sick to eat or drink, and having that in water with a little food seems to help me keep the food down. I would not start supplementing big time with any pills as your stomach may be having problems and you might just throw them right back up. In general if you are going to take any supplement, use liquid or powder form (if gel caps exist break them open.) So yeah. Here's the deal, I'm a certified yoga teacher and in my 600+ hr training we learned a lot about nutrition. Most people these days, especially women, are severely nutrition deficient, because our soils are over-farmed and depleted to the point the plants and animals we eat are not able to produce the normal levels of nutritional value. For example: Spinach 60 years ago had 40 times the amount of iron it has in it compared to day. That means in order to get the dv of iron from spinach alone you have to eat 40 times as much. So my best suggestion to you, is supplement with a couple airborne/vita c powders a day as those you can't really overdose on, next I would suggest d3 in liquid form (a few drops a day) and fish oil in liquid form (a tablespoon a day.) You can also re-up you iron, because every woman on the planet these days is iron deficient. You can get a blood draw and have normal iron levels, however you can still be anemic, due to the fact iron is stored in your bone marrow, and you can't measure how low those levels are normally (they can be very very low.) Anyway, I know a lot, and I don't mean to overshare, but knowledge is power they say. I'm not sure how it is with you, but if you are really nauseous try either black tea (straight no sugar) and/or those vita c powders from like 7/11 in water - with your food next time, and see how that makes you feel. And just go from there. Also avoid alcohol, coffee and sugar!! This should be a duh."

I never knew ferric came in liquid, that helps a lot, b/c it was killer on my stomach before.  Do you have any opinions on certain yoga poses that can be done for stress that you can do in a chair? or in a small space?  thanks so much!!!!"
ptsd,315ppu,CareflulWithThatAxe,1 point,Sat Apr 4 03:18:12 2015 UTC,"Do you have any opinions on certain yoga poses that can be done for stress that you can do in a chair? or in a small space?   Anytime you can raise your hands over your head for a few minutes while on the desk is a great way to help increase dopamine and testosterone. Think like a ""super-man"" kind of way, or if you are reaching towards the sun like a tree. You can also, while sitting in your chair, pull one leg to your chest at a time and do a few foot circles. This helps with blood flow and alertness from being in one place for a while. Bringing your knee to your chest releases pressure on the lower back, it also opens up your hips in a way that can allow blood to flow easier. Any time you have an opportunity to stand up, shake your legs and arms out and shake your hands and feet (like a sprinter might before getting on the blocks - here's a video- basically the stuff you see runners do before they start their races - are really excellent for your mental state as well, little jumps, little hip sways, hands on the hips, standing erect, shaking the legs out etc. Look at their eyes, you can see they are prepping themselves for action - so imagine yourself in the same mental state - focused mind, but relaxed as possible body - doing a little ""put your right hand in - put your right hand out and you do a little shake"" etc..it doesn't have to be serious, but in truth as a former distance runner myself - I did the exact same things over and over and over before races - with no one telling me to, it's just a natural way to calm yourself before a big event) Other ones are apanasana(supine knees to chest) and happy baby (supine knees to chest, holding the feet and rocking back and forth on your bottom - literally one of my all time favorite poses) when you get home, holding childs pose (balanasana - or the fetal position) for 5-10 minutes is known to activate the parasympathetic (relaxation), release pressure on the back and relax the stomach.  So those are my suggestions for some easy stuff. I also like to hug myself (cross my arms over eachother) while I'm lying on by back or with my legs on a chair or up a wall. Lying on your side with a big pillow between your legs can also help release the hip and re-adjust the spine. When you hug yourself (if you do) while lying on your back, start with both arms out to the side at a 90 degree angle (like a crucifix) and really feel your chest open up to the space in front of you and back to gravity- then slowly bring your arms to yourself and a very loving embrace across your chest. Then after a few minutes of breathing and feeling your ribcage open into your arms and your arms holding and loving you back, open your arms again wide to the floor at a 90 degree angle, then relax there again, perhaps with your knees bent. Then you can switch which arm is on top of the other in the hug and bring your arms slowly back to your center again - and hug with the opposite arm on top. You can also lie with your arms wide, knees up on your back, and slowly rock your knees back and forth - each time allowing your hips to tilt a little more. The important thing however is to allow your legs to relax, and allow your body to go in WHATEVER direction it wants to go as long as the end result is complete surrender to gravity. Taking (hugging) one leg to your chest at a time is also very nice to do while relaxing on your back.  Anyway... The other thing you can do if you are feeling stressed is to touch your index finger to the space between your nose and your lips (the part that has an indentation in the middle - its called the philtrum) Studies have found that for some reason (maybe related to infant breastfeeding???) if you put pressure there it also calms you down a ton. Pacifiers do this. I'm not saying buy a baby bopper but you can find that if you put your finger there with a slight pressure, generally it makes you feel a little less stressed. Good luck honey!   Also, here's a wild thought - you might not be relaxed because you have a locked diaphram (this happens to me so much). If you know how to do plow pose, this is the literally the only pose I know that can unlock my diaphragm for me (by holding it for a while - with my hands on my back - another yoga instructor taught it to me who has the same problem, it's really the only way to do it without the help of a chiropractor or massage therapist), and I also find it to be extremely relaxing. It is actually considered a yin pose. Doing plow pose and then apanasana or balanasana is one of those things I like to do if I am particularly sore or stressed.  Edit: I have to post this one too. (800m olympics - these women are BEASTS) I fucking love women's running. Really, pay attention how each woman is shaking her legs out, jumping, swinging the arms, running in place etc. . . these are all ways to shake off stress. When an animal ever escapes a raw situation - for example - of you see two dogs fight each-other - you will notice that each dog will shake themselves after the fight, maybe even run around a few circles. That is their natural way of shaking off the stress. We humans forget we are governed by the same laws."

ptsd,312gyb,mydaddyisadrunkass,1 point,Thu Apr 2 05:20:13 2015 UTC,"Very much recognition here, even though it is way better with me now. Your '3' is probably also dissociation.   I was very confused lately when my therapist told me that that state of mind also is dissociation, since that means I've almost dissociated all my life, just different ways. Not to sound whiney or anything, but it put my whole life in a different perspective. I thought those were moments I felt safe, for me it often were moments I was drawing or crafting as a child. But now I realize that even in those moments, which always were my reference when I tried to imagine how people without PTSD must feel on a normal day, were actually dissociative. For me it was always, my world, or my fantasy place.  It is possible to get out of that state, at least it is for me. I'm not good at it yet, I still need help from a therapist to do it, but that 'normal' state that you seek (if I read between you lines, rightly), it is possible to find it. I don't remember many times that I felt that normal/attentive state, not even as a toddler, but I found it (back?) with help of a haptotherapist. So there is hope. But I understand you need your time. Don't forget, though, you might have not been able to walk away in the past when bad things happened to you, but that doesn't automatically mean you're not able now.  I hope you find your way."

Use a letterhead you create for your ""consulting"" business. Tell them you will no longer have any contact with them unless they pay their past due balance.  Usually if you hit someone in the wallet, they suddenly get some sense. Worst case, they send you a big check. Then you take some of that check and fire off another letter from your lawyer telling them to cease and desist.  My guess is you start charging them ( and you SHOULD!

Follow through and get a lawyer the instant they do anything after the letter. Ask your therapist for advice if you can't afford a lawyer or don't know who to hire. She likely has relevant experience through clients and there is pro bono and stuff. Do take your therapist up on helping write the letter.

GET OUT OF YOUR LIVING ARRANGEMENT NOW!   If you can't relax and defuse in your home, you never will get relief. Do you know when you attack is coming? Not what triggers them but the physical/mental symptoms that tell you an attack is coming. I've yet to find my triggers but I can tell you I'm about to have one due to one of my symptoms (I have a few). When my symptoms occur, I have X amount of minutes until I'm full on rage panic attack mode and can't be consoled by anyone or anything. I take my medication when I feel the symptoms but it's not instant. But enough about me, this is you time.   You can only control what you do and only what you do. Being concerned or aware of others that may be a victim of child abuse is one thing but you can't fight the fight for them. I'm not saying don't report a person for child abuse or potential abuse but you can't be the judicial system. Fighting the fight with our condition has to be consolidated and acute. Very accurate and pin-pointed so that the facts and concern are recorded. Our feelings are controlling us now, our feelings control our physical being beyond what we want at times. Take caution and focus on facts.   Help yourself and find a top level apartment or house at least 3 car lengths away from your neighbors. You may find obstacles to moving out to think of them as stepping stones/goals to unleash yourself from one burden. Pursue this option with all your heart, it's their land and you're just renting; it sucks.   If moving is not an option, find the landlord tenant code for your state. Find what your rights are and contact the legal aid office within your area. Explain your situation and legal aid can help as needed.

What I might suggest in the future is to cut and run when these symptoms arise, who cares what strangers think - 9 times out of 10 we won't see or remember them again. It's our life and what we choose to make out of it. This is our life to enjoy. Let's say that again, it's our life to enjoy and we can do that once we adapt to our surroundings.   You seem very adjusted in the normal world but have alot of factors, receptors so to speak that are being overly stimulated. What you can try is wearing headphones around you with your favorite tunes, comedian stand-ups (my favorite - don't care if people think I'm weird, it's the not knowing part that keeps them away from me in the waiting room lol) or your favorite podcasts. That way you can immerse yourself in your world even when your not physically there.   If you have a hour without any issues, congratulate yourself, it's not silly, you'll definitely start to accomplish something as they mount up. If something happens, write it down. Oh before I forget, create a journal to document your day, your goals, accomplishments and future plans. Use micro goals and work up. A win is a win, no matter the size or degree. Our goals with this condition differ as we first start but as we accomplish goals and move forward more options open up. Be patient and do your best not someone else's best; you're you and I'm me and other people are other people, you can't strive to be as others but as the best yourself you can be and be happy with.

My therapist suggested I explore the world like I had a mild case of amnesia and sent me to the grocery store. I tried fruits that were new to me, found a few surprises that  made me happy, then moved on to other departments.  I discovered a few dislikes along the way-an important part of identity too.

I also work a lot and often get home quite late, so rarely want to take the time to clean it and set it up. But I would think to myself - if my partner had a late night, wouldn't she be happy to have a fresh pot of coffee in the morning when she woke up? That would give me the motivation to do it, in that context. I would wake up and, while enjoying my fresh pot of coffee, actually thank my past self for taking the time and energy to do a nice thing for me. This was my first step. This also works for when you come home shit faced, puke in the sink and break shit. You wake up and be forgiving and compassionate to your past self, it's human to make mistakes, no big deal, we can get through this.   Once that dialogue begins, and sometimes I needed to think about the past and future selves as other people who I cared about because it was motivating to me, it starts coming more natural. I found myself routinely doing nice things for myself, being grateful to myself, and compassionate and caring when I fucked up. As someone else said, discover what fruits or foods you actually like by trying s bunch in isolation of anyone else. Do nice things by then buying these things for your future self, and appreciative of your past self for doing that. You get the point.  Mindfulness to present self. I would suffer with my wallet in my back pocket, cold feet, having to go pee until it hurt, being too cold, too hot, basically, thirsty, tired, hungry, etc. and just generally not being mindful of my own body. If your feet are cold, get some socks. If your wallet is uncomfortable, move it to the front pocket or take it out. Feed yourself, hydrate yourself, get plenty of rest. Be kind. Pretend it's someone else you are doing it for at first, but start the narrative. The narrative starts breaking down the walls. I cried a lot at first, because behind those walls held pain, grief, and a lot of anger, but it's not infinite. There is an end to it, but the only way to that end is through it.   I'm not perfect, but I no longer expect myself to be. I have bad and good days but the good far out number the bad. I've been on this path for over three years. I have a relationship with myself for the first time in my entire life. It's rocky at times but getting stronger all the time. You can do this too. Just start the narrative. Learn who you are, be kind, forgiving, and above all, loving, to yourself. Good luck."

They're abstract, often horrible, but they feel emotionally real.  They're downright disturbing, but I welcome them, to an extent, because they feel real.  No, that's a lie.  I don't welcome them.  But I know how to deal through them, and that's more than can be said for my life.    It's kind of sad, because I'm fairly young."

I still go into what i like to call ""survival mode"" but it takes something really BIG to trigger it. I've also discovered some things about myself, likes and dislikes. This is  HUGE improvement. I remember one day sitting down and making a list a couple of yrs ago. Things I don't like, things I do. What my favorite color was? Ect. The list was almost completely blank. I was a blank slate as a person yet I could survive the worst conditions. THAT was who I was the person who survived. Now things have changed slowly but surely.  I've found I have wants not just needs. Things that make me happy and bring me a sense of self identity. It's taken me years to get where I am but I'm proud of these accomplishments. It's takes time. I believe you will find these things out about yourself too. Keep looking and don't be afraid to open yourself up to new things. : )"

ptsd,30rnxm,Baryshnikov_Rifle,2,Mon Mar 30 04:30:11 2015 UTC,I guess my question would be do you find yourself zoning out during intimacy with a partner or are you able to full connect to your partner the whole time? Are you able to accept and receive pleasure as well as give it?  Are you able to give it when you're alone and not zone out? If you're zoning out with a partner then you're still being triggered or you have unresolved feelings that need to be explored.    Are you good to yourself in other ways? Do you allow yourself to feel pleasure in non sexual ways? Are you in tune with your body?
ptsd,30rnxm,Drabbeynormalblues,2,Mon Mar 30 05:52:15 2015 UTC,"It's weird because initially I was actually very promiscuous. It wasn't until I really got into therapy that I started to lack attraction to others and be vehemently opposed to being touched. I think it has to do with vulnerability. To do therapy properly you need to let your walls down. Sex requires vulnerability unless your walls are up. I don't have answers yet, but I'm hoping that after some time, I will be more comfortable with being constantly vulnerable and intimacy will be easier."
ptsd,30rnxm,Blu_wolf,1 point,Wed Apr 1 07:58:15 2015 UTC,"Late 20's, family-based trauma here. When I become intimate I find it difficult to focus after a while and I try to go really fast, not to maintain an erection but to maintain arousal. I find that when I'm with someone I'm comfortable with I will get to a point during copulation where I disassociate, and suddenly I'm watching my body through my eyes. This is where my mind starts to drift to unpleasant places. I've stopped mid-coitus, and it's almost always uncomfortable for me. I've even done pushups afterwards to find mental clarity.  Fortunately or unfortunately I find that ""exciting"" experiences have a way of avoiding the above, multiple-partners, ""risky"", or even semi-public can extend arousal enough for me to reach climax. I sometimes feel a little dirty after these experiences, and generally prefer self-stimulation. I think there's maybe some shame I have yet to work through, but that's for another post.  The Viagra will give you an erection but it sounds like this isn't so much physical as psychosomatic.   Have you discussed this with your partner? How do they feel? I know I have some compounded guilt for what may be perceived as ""withholding sex"", but my partner is vocally supportive."
ptsd,30s477,kevducharme,2,Mon Mar 30 06:02:23 2015 UTC,"First off I would definitely be concerned. These could be PTSD, but there could also be something going on in his diet and or medications that are making things worse. For example. . . celiacs, steroids, any severe deficiency of vitamins, chronic insomnia (not sleeping for over 3 days can make you a temporary schizophrenic) a bad reaction to pot, anything. It could also be an onset of schizophrenia. And if your friend is in his mid twenties there is also a chance he might have that. It's really hard to say. Without knowing what he is doing to his body in depth (and he might not be willing to tell you) only you can guess and only a doctor can know.  I have PTSD, and the only time I got that delusional was when I was so severely stressed out, wasn't sleeping and malnourished and over-medicated and weak that I would hear voices and see things that weren't there and I didn't know what was happening until I figured out it was a combo of malnourishment, stress and over-medication. I saw auras, and it was like a bad trip of mushrooms or something. . . with auditory hallucinations where I'd hear my name and look over my shoulder and no one would be there. But I knew right off there was something wrong. I never thought my brain-farts were real. I did certainly have mild paranoia (and still do sometimes). But it wasn't to the level of your friend. It was more like ""everyone finds me threatening and wouldn't care if they were given a free pass to kick me to the curb"" not ""someones planting evidence in my room to collude me with Al Queda because I meet the space aliens and I know how to save the world etc."" Part of me always was able to step back and know its because my stress level/diet etc was effed up. That didn't make them any less scary to experience, but I never thought I was being persecuted. I was lucky enough to be stubborn enough about real life evidence for things - who knows. Your friend may be having a psychotic break of some kind - a start of schizophrenia or something like BP or who knows....that's just my two cents.  I have known crazy people who are very very paranoid before, but not quite schizophrenic and imagining improbable things. I wouldn't know what to call them. Paranoid delusion probably. Avoidance personality. Borderline? They have a persecution delusion that people always want to steal from them or be mean to them..my mom is like this, she has bipolar and borderline but it never goes to the level of supernatural or improbable. I also have a schizophrenic uncle. I've never met him but he's doing well with treatment supposedly. If he's not on meds he gets real bad fears and delusions."

Who knows how this might turn for the worst, and as bad as it may sound (I am an overly caring person myself so I hate this reality) the first rule of the game when dealing with anyone mentally ill is protecting yourself first, because mental illness = unpredictability. For the most part, that unpredictability leads to the person self-harming (most mentally ill are not violent) however you never know what kind of abuse you might be subjected to. At any time. It could be a thing where you jump to stop them from putting the knife at their throat and then they stab you back....etc...so be very very careful and do your best. Show your friend that you love him. Give him a good easy gift or card like ""I know you are having a hard time but I'll always be your friend"" etc... I don't know honestly. Good luck!"

Before we moved I made sure to tell him that we were leaving one shit show for another. Just so he knew it and acknowledged it. >_< It's not the neighbor's fault, really. They're actually better neighbors here than the last building. It's just the construction is thin walls as is pretty much every apartment building in Los Angeles.

It seems like writing not only helps in getting the ruminative thoughts and anxiety out of the system (our amygdala), but it also causes us to think which leads to better understanding and insight...Hope this helps & sorry for the late reply."

I tell my fiancé what I want, when I'm ready, if it hurts, he doesn't go for it unless I'm okay with it. It took me a while to be okay with sex, but really you have to find what makes you enjoy it again and ways it won't trigger you. If it means tying your partner up so you feel safe, or first self exploring until you feel more comfortable with penetration, then explain it to your SO and if they don't get it then get a better SO. You deserve to feel safe and loved. Edit: Forgot to mention when you do attempt it to make sure and use some lube or oil so you don't get sore/pain, I know it can be triggering. Also make sure you are excited enough and ready for it, if you haven't self explored before you should, you should have minimal discomfort and if you have pain with any penetration even when you are lubed and excited and relaxed you should see your obgyn, since that could be a medical problem that some women have."

It's horribly uncomfortable and painful when this surfaces.  For me, who is sexually adventurous like you (switch), there have been phases when ANY power exchange causes me to dissociate. I run the real risk of fracturing when this is going on and have learned that I need non-objectification-holistic-love-making that is kink free for a while. As a sexually abused child I was not seen as a real, whole person by my abusers. There comes a time when I need to know my beloved kink partners can see me as just a person, even if I KNOW intellectually I need assurance through touch and action.  I am in such a phase now and it sucks so much. My current partners are not available for what I need and I am celibate until I find someone appropriate to be sexual with again.

I once asked a counselor at a treatment program I was in if I had BPD and she said ""You're not borderline, if youwere I wouldn't want to have anything to do with you"" (!!!!!!).  Personally I don't care about the label it falls under, or even if I have BPD, C-PTSD or both. I just wanna get better, and that's what dx's are supposed to be for - figuring out the appropriate treatment.  Sorry if that's unhelpful but that's been my experience."
ptsd,30er07,alush,2,Fri Mar 27 16:19:08 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the reply.  I've been reading lately that it seems possible that women are often dx'd with BPD while men with the same symptoms would be diagnosed with PTSD. Someone close to me has been diagnosed with BPD, but it's obvious (to her doctor as well) that it is the result of being assaulted as a teen.  I've been giving a lot of thought as to whether or not her treatment would have been better of if she had been given a PTSD diagnosis."
ptsd,30er07,alush,1 point,Fri Mar 27 16:26:54 2015 UTC,"I've heard the same thing about women and men. It's possible, but not necessarily true - I got the PTSD dx straight off the bat and 10 years later I'm just now getting appropriate treatment for it. There is definitely a huge stigma attached to the BPD label, though"
ptsd,30er07,so7n,1 point,Fri Mar 27 16:54:42 2015 UTC,"You can have both and it is common to have PTSD if you are a borderline with a trauma history. My official diagnosis is ""complex PTSD with some BPD traits"". I've been told by internet trolls and self-proclaimed ""PTSD experts"" that there is no such thing as C-PTSD, yet this label was given to me by one of the top psychiatrists in Canada (both at the same time). While C-PTSD is not an official DSM-V diagnosis, I can guarantee it will be in the next revision.. because it is very different from combat or one-off trauma experiences. Thus why it never gets taken seriously by bible-thumping psychology freaks.   Anyway, I did about 30 weeks of DBT therapy and now those traits are nearly nonexistent, and the PTSD symptoms are manageable with medical marijuana and body based awareness therapy. Both share some similarities like emotional dysregulation, hypervigilance/fortune-telling, poor interpersonal  skills and self-harm/addiction which is why DBT is useful for both. Things like insomnia, depression, isolation, and DP/DR/flashbacks were generally unaffected for me, though I know have the ability to recognize when my body is in a flashback (they are not always visual) and de-escalate the situation before it spirals into full dissociation. Which is a marked improvement from being crippled with fear and not sleeping for 3-4 days with worry over when the next flashback or nightmare would occur."

My heart would start beating fast and I couldn't breathe, then I'd get a horrible migraine AND I'd panic.  It helps, but definitely talk to your doctor if anything like what happened to me occurs.

Also, ""quit[ting] thinking about it"" is the gist of CBT, so they're not entirely wrong, and one can work with it if it comes up in a genuine debate.  It sucks, and it's extremely hurtful to have people not understand me on such a fundamental level, and there are a few key take-aways that I've come up with for my life:   PTSD is my biggest vulnerability. If my enemies and annoying relatives wanted to fuck with my life with the most minimal effort, this is what they would use. It's a no-brainer. Lucky for me, they have no idea, even when they are told, repeatedly. It just doesn't register. People often tell me I can't be depressed, seeing as I'm the cheerfullest person they know.

By saying 'this person I know just needs to try harder to snap out of it', they are saying they would know a way out of it if it would happen to them. Otherwise it would be too scary. We have some sort of cure for most diseases, but mental health is the most frightening and at the same time least understood of illnesses (IMO).

The problem gets worse when they won't respect or understand that there really is something going on with us, which under the right circumstances could also be them."
ptsd,30br8k,rachiedoubt,5,Thu Mar 26 01:54:13 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if I'm reading this correctly, but it sounds to me like you're already in therapy and treatment. My understanding is that feeling responsible is perfectly normal for someone with ptsd. My best advice as someone who also feels responsible for his trauma is to continue your therapy and treatment. There's unfortunately no quick fix for it. Over time you'll learn that none of this is your fault. At least that's what my therapist says."
ptsd,30br8k,Disabilitydude22,3,Thu Mar 26 02:54:07 2015 UTC,"I haven't gone through the same situation, but I too developed the feelings you feel towards your mom and family, feeling responsible, constantly needing to apologize. My dad was a very angry man who took it out on me, my sisters, and my mom. My sisters though older weren't as mature, they had seen my dad before he turned into a horrible person. My sisters were allowed to go to school, I wasn't, my sisters and I have a 6-4 year gap, when my sisters left for college they left me in hell. Instead of me comforting them, the anger being distributed through three of us and mom, it was all on me and mom. My mom would break down, I'd have to comfort her I couldn't rely on her for help or comfort, I wasn't hugged by her unless I was hugging her to comfort her. I could go on, but my point is I developed the feeling that I needed to protect her, that her suffering was my fault. I tried to advise her, we could leave dad, we could escape. But she never listened, she just wanted to complain and cry, her life got more miserable and so did mine.   One day I realized I couldn't force her to make her life better, she was willing to take me down with her. I tried to prepare her for my leaving and then I eventually left. I still feel responsible for her, I know she's miserable, but she won't seek help or leave and by now any help she would've had has either passed on or left. She created her own hell and she did nothing to leave it.   I realize it's hard because you still want to be loved, but you need to try to love yourself, it's not easy. It takes time, do nice things for yourself at least once a day, say something nice to yourself. Write down your good traits for example your kindness and your wanting to help people. Try to realize you are worth as much as anyone else, you don't need to apologize for everything.   I used to apologize for everything, after my parents I had an ex who sexually assaulted me, I didn't blame him at the time. I didn't do anything wrong to him, I treated him well even when he broke promises mistreated me, used me, assaulted me (I clearly didn't want it I was shaking in fear), then he decided he got what he wanted and decided instead of breaking up with me he was going to blame me. He blamed me for everything, he said I was crazy, he said things that broke me so badly it took me almost a year to finally realize it wasn't my fault and then 4 more years to stop apologizing for every little thing. My point being, your mom took you and broke you down and used you, she took your freedom, your happiness and your sense of self worth. It's going to take a while to get it even close to normal. It's not your fault, it's hers. Blame the right person, she's the one that broke your spirit, most parents build up their children so they can survive in the real world and your mom tore you down. I know how hard it was for me to blame the people responsible, I realize your mom may have a really sad life story that wasn't shared but that doesn't change what she did to you. What she's going to do, honestly I'd report her to the authorities to help your siblings. You are in control now, you make your life choices.   I'm sorry you had to go through all of this, I can tell you it gets better, I really wish I could make it easier for you. Hearing your story makes me want to cry because I know how bad those feelings are, feeling responsible apologizing till your voice grows horse. I'm so sorry you had to go through everything you did, but you have a future now, you have your life to reclaim from the abuse. You can and will get better.   PS: Sorry this got so long, I just know what I needed to hear so long ago."

ptsd,30bg0t,oulamer,5,Thu Mar 26 00:25:20 2015 UTC,"From what I've read, experiencing trauma does predispose you to experiencing more trauma, in a few ways. Experiencing trauma like child abuse or domestic violence can make you more susceptible to people who abuse, because you don't get red flags like other people (it seems normal to you). One way to circumvent that is to learn what a healthy relationship is in general and having boundaries. A great way to do that is through therapy.  There have also been studies that have suggested that experiencing past trauma in general can make you more susceptible to finding things more traumatic (e.g. A job loss can become traumatic and triggering, instead of a period of adjustment). From what I've read there, the re-experiencing of trauma is mitigated when you get proper treatment for the trauma. Which is great news. So you may want to check out some evidence-based therapy approaches to trauma if you haven't already. Sorry for no sources, I just tend to pick these things up."
ptsd,30bg0t,Aml2012,3,Thu Mar 26 04:44:31 2015 UTC,"Yes, previous trauma can make you less ""trauma resistant"" or prone to anxiety, which might be what you're experiencing. Finding a therapist would be a good step.  It sounds like you are stuck on what could have happened in that situation and perhaps the powerlessness of it.  A therapist can help you redirect your thoughts and explore underlying fears.  Just talking about it with someone who understands can help a lot."
ptsd,30bg0t,Tytillean,2,Thu Mar 26 08:48:26 2015 UTC,"I think that trauma puts you in a state of always being anxious and on the lookout for things to go wrong. I can imagine if you thought about it, you felt this way even before the dog incident - and given the fact I'm sure that was a highly anxious experience, it compounded your trauma which makes you have flashbacks to the initial incident too.  Unfortunately I think that when you're on the lookout and bad things eventually do happen, it only reinforces the anxiety, which leads to more unsteadiness, flashbacks, etc and the cycle continues. At least, this has been my experience.  I think the only way to manage it is to defend yourself for next time. If you can conquer the next event without going down the rabbit hole, you can attribute this as progress. and these don't have to be huge events. I can't give you any examples because I don't know the subject of your trauma, but I've learned to analyze how I handle most daily situations and really analyze how the make me feel and if anything at all feels like my trauma, I try to find the brightside, and stay positive about it.  I think once you can make the connection between new events and the first event, it makes it easier to keep them separate. Don't let these things try and grow interest, cash out as soon as possible."

It's hard, because I've made my peace with the other parent. But I have distanced myself from all of my family, and I never felt better.  Try to see the wedding as a profound transition point. ""After this is over, I am going to live my own life, create a new family, and be at peace."" Humor them and include them, while imagining them fading away into the background of your life.

Thank you for responding. I'm sorry you had to go through so much, good on you for standing up for yourself and your happiness and cutting ties! I'm glad you are feeling so much better! I know my fiance's biggest fear about me cutting off my family is that I'll feel worse because I tend to blame myself for everything (thanks to my parents). Was it hard for you when you first did it?

Then they e-mailed m when I returned home, which I just responded to with everything I was disgusted about and why I didn't need them in my life as they claimed I did. NOBODY needs to be talked to or treated the way they treated me!  Now, that person just has to accept it. the rest of my large family keeps inviting me to parties in their state, but I just keep making it clear that isn't gonna happen. I do not ever want to return from visiting people, with a desire to kill myself because of their behavior toward me. And I have zero trust that my family can protect me from being harmed this way. So guess what? No more visits!  I feel bad that this where we still are, but I did not create the environment. I grieve what will never be, I do miss some of my family, but I don't miss the panic attacks when going there or the second-guessing about myself when I returned.  They go all over the world, but none of my family visits me because I'm not living in a mansion and I moved a few hours away in another state to be far away from them.

I wouldn't describe it as going from one pole to the other, just generally I woke up and was at my limit from all the long term issues I faced and a lot of the thoughts and feelings I can normally fight off got to me and I've been depressed ever since. I've been dwelling and crying and being emotional about a lot of traumatic things this week too. I am in an extremely complicated place right now. It's not a straight forward battle."

Now that my ptsd symptoms aren't debilitatingly overwhelming, I'm having a hard time managing myself between emotional extremes.  I, too, have wondered if I'm bipolar, but I've discussed it with my therapist many times, and I don't qualify for that diagnosis."
ptsd,302na9,idontunderstand456,2,Mon Mar 23 23:47:16 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry that happened to you.  You are right; PTSD does not develop that fast. But, here is something interesting: not all women who are raped develop PTSD, but nearly ALL women who are raped show symptoms of PTSD at the hospital immediately following the rape.  Having PTSD-like symptoms merely one week after a major trauma is common, and it does not necessarily mean you will go on to develop PTSD.  For what it's worth, I have been in your shoes, kinda. I was in a severe accident, probably should have died, came out with only minor wounds. This was almost 2 years ago. For maybe a year after the accident, I had frequent panic attacks while driving. The sound of a passing ambulance's siren brought everything back. I relived it, night after night. I compulsively watched videos of car accidents for hours.   So, similar symptoms. The good news is all that has gone away. I still don't like sirens, but I never have anyways. I rarely think about the accident, and when I do, all the pain and horror of it all seems so distant now. Just like a faded photograph.  Anyway, this long ramble to tell you I've been in a similar situation, and for me it got better. I think it would be good to be a little gentler with yourself; one week is no time at all to recover from a traumatic event. I'd also encourage you to talk about it, to reach out and not isolate yourself from others. Research shows that the people who experience traumatic events but do not go on to develop PTSD consistently have strong social connections. Even if you can't yet talk about what happened, just making sure you get out around people is helpful.  I hope that helps. Try to take care of yourself as best you can."
ptsd,302na9,alush,1 point,Tue Mar 24 05:23:45 2015 UTC,"Thank you. It helps so much to have someone else, who has been in similar shoes, to put things in perspective.   I sincerely hope that I'll be able to do the same."

I am struggling with boundaries (and self worth, and my voice) and find myself retreating to my safe space much more often than I would like. It's a cycle and I am practicing but it feels very awkward.  It has helped a ton since I am being careful about who I spend time with- in particular I am trying to be around people who have very strong, safe (and agreeable for me) personal boundaries. For instance, I have a great friend who would never raise his voice or be rude to a service person and it's nice to go have coffee with him. He is very aware of making others comfortable and lets me pick where we sit and when I need to go.  It makes it easy to be within my healthy boundaries when I have the support of his."

I have already slightly altered the color scheme, but I'm wary of changing too much for a few reasons, one of which is that mental health related sites usually have two modes - 1. Overly pastel / sappy / coddling, or 2. Very dark and depressing.   Something bright and garish can seem inappropriate for the subject matter, whereas something more somber can sap the user and make the sub more depressing than it needs to be, too. I am not saying this as a way to shut down discussion on changing the color scheme, though. I would just like to point out that there are considerations that need to be taken into account for a mental health sub that are different than for, say, a fan-themed subreddit or other casual content.  As to tags, I will need to learn how to do that - which is fine - but it isn't going to be right away, as I have pressing things happening in my personal life at the moment and I'd like to take a few hours (when I'm not exhausted) to sit down and do a good job with it / get it done."

One is that I have great difficulty with children, animals, and retarded people. Anything not culpable for their own actions, anyone who can't ""carry their own weight"", I have great trouble interacting with.   The other, is that while I have trouble empathising and respecting members of the GenPop because of their lack of perspective, I do not want them to go through what I've gone through to have the perspective I have.

I was abused by ex-military and it is my veteran friends who I relate to most comfortably because they understand the psych ops like others don't.

My best advice is to take note of what is triggering the attack.  I had a confusing time about a year ago, when for no reason at all I had panic attacks every day at 7pm. It was like clockwork and very upsetting. I did go to therapy and learned a trick called mindfulness. I had to learn mantras to get me through those attacks.

I was able to see a therapist, learn new coping skills. Ones that really help me are the 5 senses, as I have the dissociative subtype of PTSD. I focus on my sense of touch, sense of taste, sense of smell, sense of hearing, and sense of sight. You can also do breathing exercises as well to help slow you down.

You don't need to know your diagnosis or understand the root of your problems in order to get help, which is the other good news.   I started with a licensed marriage & family therapist I found online, largely picked for location, available times, and insurance coverage. He referred me to another therapist within the same practice, who I've worked with for several years now with great results. He focuses on Cognitive Behavioral methods, which seem to have the best results for me. I had sought therapy in the past from a wide variety of providers - RNPs, family practitioners, psychologists, psychiatrists, MSW's - and although some of them helped slightly, some were entirely useless or only wanted to prescribe medication. What I needed was to be given specific tasks and feedback, exercises I could do at home to help with stress, anxiety, hyper-vigilance and impulsivity, which interfered with my relationships and the life I wanted. CBT helped significantly more than any other treatment I tried.   Whatever you think may be going on, the most important thing is to make the call. It's important to remember throughout the process that you are 100% in control. You can choose to be fearless, vulnerable, guarded and/ or demanding. You can work at a pace that is comfortable for you and if a particular subject or task seems overwhelming, you don't have to do it. You can communicate your expectations clearly to your therapist, and can move on to another provider at any time if you don't think the treatment is working for you.   If you really want to change your situation, just keep trying until you get the results you want. Just the act of seeking help and expecting positive results is an important part of building resilience, growing stronger and truly believing that you deserve the life you want."

You might be blanking out because your mind knows you're expected to write a detailed account of the trauma next. Maybe if you don't write the detailed account, then the impact statement will flow more easily. Or maybe not. If you don't feel ready to write, then don't do it.  How long have you been working with this therapist? CPT may or may not be right for you. If it doesn't feel right, then perhaps you two can figure out a different strategy for treatment.  EDIT: The PTSD Workbook had an exercise that worked for me: In the beginning, you're asked to draw pictures depicting aspects of your life, and how you feel. (They emphasize that you're not being judged for artistic talent/ability. I drew lots of stick figures.)  Spoiler alert: At the end of the book, they ask you to repeat the exercise, and compare the two sets of pictures to see how far you've come.  Maybe drawing would work for you?

Many doctors have found that in asking a patient to relive the details, they are actually hurting the recovery and re-traumatizing patients.  I highly suggest you and your doctor both read ""8 keys to safe trauma recovery"" by Babette Rothschild. She is a leader in PTSD treatment and has been very vocal about this issue. Specifically chapter 3 ""Remembering is NOT required.""  If you feel that remembering and writing the details is not helpful to you, then please don't do it.  Second, I remember every detail very vividly, so I decided to write it out (again, because I chose to, not because it is necessary to the healing process). Afterwards, I was completely drained emotionally and there were multiple parts where I had to stop and just cry it out. I did it in the early evening and then watched a funny TV show afterwards. Looking back, I am not sure what I gained from the process of writing it down, but that is how I took care of myself afterwards.  Best wishes to you for better days ahead.

There is a part of me that really wants to do it, mostly because I've had very severe dissociative symptoms. Until recently I had been losing chunks of my day (almost like blacking out from drinking, except I'm completely sober these days) and had zero ability to identify feelings aside from ""tired"" and ""rage"".  I might just be barreling ahead with this because therapy and meds were a long time coming, and now that I finally have insurance I want to solve all the things at once. Turns out it's harder than that though.  I'll bring up what you said with my therapist next Tuesday, though I do think I will make an attempt to start on the ""impact"" statement side - how it affects my life today, rather than the trauma itself.

It helped me a great deal (in addition to my psychiatrist and PTSD Group Workshop).  I use to lose chunks of my day to dissociation as well. I have found grounding techniques and mindfulness/CBT were most helpful for that.  I can completely relate to wanting to get it all done once you have access to the appropriate care. Ripping off the bandaid is nice in theory, but in practice it takes far more than just motivation and professional support. I am an impatient person in general, so being told ""it takes time"" is maddening, even if it is true.  You are right, the ""impact"" statement is a different sort of assignment and could be very beneficial. I didn't mean to advise you against doing the detailed trauma assignment either- do whatever is best for you.

I was very fortunate to have a fantastic therapist, she really was great. I felt safe and trusted the process. The thing about writing it all out, (at least how it worked for me) is that the trauma has limits, a beginning and an end, and writing it out helped to contain it, and in a strange way, I became to believe that it was over, and after a time, I could stop reliving it over and over repeating and retraumatizing myself with the memory. I'm sorry, I can't really communicate any better than that, about how it worked. I also had a sort of ritual, I would go swimming in a lake after therapy, and was able to release a lot being physical and in the water.

Sometimes if my boyfriend says something that even smells slightly of controlling my emotions I see red and freak out, and he's as far from being abusive as you can get. I think coming out of a situation like yours, checking yourself and evaluating your relationships is totally normal.   It's hard for me to provide advice on your specific relationship based on what you say here, but do you have a close friend that you can use to help check your sense of the situation? I had a friend like that when I first started dating my boyfriend, and it was really helpful."

I'm looking for a nice soft yellow or amber glow. I have been searching amazon and I have seen those beautiful projector ones which I think would be a wonderful grounding tool to use during the day. I guess I'm just curious to hear what other people have found useful. At the moment I'm using a small torch standing up facing the roof :p The trouble is the batteries keep running out and I have woken up in pitch darkness a few times gasp!

ptsd,2zjhgp,ithinkimay,3,Thu Mar 19 02:04:29 2015 UTC,It's possible that was a flashback of some sorts. Not everyone with PTSD has flashbacks though so your doctors shouldn't be confused. Everyone is different. It's good you're getting the help you deserve.   Good luck. :)
ptsd,2zjhgp,DocFreudstein,3,Thu Mar 19 07:44:37 2015 UTC,"There are different types of flashbacks.  I, for one, tend to react in a violent way when I feel like I'm in a similar situation to the trauma I experienced.  It's not like I'm seeing images of what happened, but I feel like I'm in the same ""headspace.""  Sounds like you may have experienced something similar.  My therapist has me try to deep breathe and move past it, because I can rationalize that what's happening in the moment is not ""real,"" but I can't get that emotion out of my head.  It sounds like you need to try and ""ground"" yourself in some way as well.  You snapped out of it through remembering where you were, so maybe try and find some way to keep that grasp on the here-and-now in order to keep the emotional flashback from overtaking you.  Good luck!"

You seem to be functioning pretty good in daily life, and that's awesome. Whatever symptoms you're experiencing, there's no need to panic, or get upset; You're not doomed, you're going to be fine.  Having said that... The event you described does sound a lot like a flashback. As /u/DocFreudstein pointed out, there are many different types of flashbacks: visual, auditory, emotional, etc.  I do suffer flashbacks, mine are mostly emotional; also my thoughts are interrupted and I can't focus or concentrate on anything when I'm in the middle of one. Thankfully, they're happening less and less frequently the more I stick with therapy, meditation, and EMDR."

It may be time to reevaluate your relationship with this person.  I have told a few people that I'm in therapy. I work freelance, so I tell my clients that I have a standing engagement every Tuesday (that's therapy day), but I don't tell them what it is, I just emphasize I can't get out of it.  As for PTSD: I've told exactly 4 people. One person is my therapist, and two others are close friends who have PTSD or dissociative symptoms of their own. I don't want to become known as ""the guy with PTSD,"" or ""a victim,"" so I doubt I'll tell anyone else until I've worked through it, and buried PTSD in my past."

But you can't change them so they do get it. I don't like telling everyone, but once I've made it to a point in the relationship I'll tell them I have PTSD but not what happened. I try to do it in a way that explains some of my behavior, but with some people I never speak of it for similar reasons to what inspired your post. They don't get it, like I didn't understand why people were awkward before I got it, and unless, heaven forbid, they do get PTSD, then its often just best to leave them to their ignorance. I hope that helps."

My suggestion is maybe go to a gym and use that anger/frustrations to achieve good and to better your health! I have been diagnosed with ptsd for about 3 years as well and I get very angry and emotional. It's a Rollercoaster and a battle that feels like will never be won! But it will be won, you have to learn how to train your mind to be better and to overcome the inner thoughts and triggers. It's hard, very hard. I have a therapist and psychologist. I have to take meds to keep my anxiety from going through the roof. I have found that having hobbies with friends, talking to your SO, and hanging out with your best friend is the best cure of all! Finding that comfort in someone and being around them helps so much.   I want you to know that you are not alone. Yes it feels like you're the only one in this world fighting, but you're not.

ptsd,2zdrew,lifeslittlelemons,2,Tue Mar 17 19:11:04 2015 UTC,"I'm not in a good place right now to write a thoughtful response, but just wanted to reply to let you know you're not alone with your dissociative symptoms."
ptsd,2zdrew,exposingmysecrets,2,Mon Mar 23 03:02:43 2015 UTC,"Hey, I'm not a trained psychiatrist or anything, but when it is severe as this, are you sure it is not dissociative identity disorder (DIS) or possibly psychotic episodes?  I have dissociative episodes, but not to the point that I am far away from home and can't remember anything. It's just that while dissociating my experiences feel like a dream, I experience less or no physical pain, I tend to walk towards lights and want to touch peoples faces, as if it is a dream world. I do have memories afterwards, but they are really fuzzy as if I try to remember a time when I have been drinking and had multiple black outs.  What helped most for me is to have a therapist that is familiar with dissociation. At the start of my diagnosis I found it hard to relate to the syptoms I read on internet, because it wasn't clear to myself what dissociation is. I recognized the worst episodes, the ones that ended in hurting myself and or others and falling asleep of exhaustion, but apperently I dissociated 90% of the time. Just during conversations, colleges, etc. I never noticed, because it was so normal to me to at least dissociate a little that I didn't know I was supposed to feel different. My therapist gave me very good feed back on when she saw I was drifting away and helped me coming back and that helped a lot in recognizing it for me and also recognizing what triggers dissociation and what helps me to prevent it.  It's hard, though, isn't it? I hate it that I feel like I can't trust myself. How can I make sure I don't go running naked on the highway when dissociating? It really makes you doubt whether you're crazy or not, I know.   It can get better, though. At this moment, even when my episode are quite severe, I takes me longer to really black out and also I have more control during that prestage so that I sometimes can prevent the blacking out.  But you'll need a very attentive therapist. I my experience most therapists didn't recognize it or didn't know how to handle it. I hope that you find someone who understand it better than you do and can help you move forward.  For me it also helps that I told some good friends that I tend to dissociate and that when they see me staring, talking incomprehensily or acting weird or slow, that it is best for me when they put me in bed, don't touch me unnecessarily and stay with me until I sleep. I take Temazepam to get quicker to sleep when I dissociate. It gives me at least a little bit of trust that I will be taken good care of when I can't do that myself.  And it is really disruptive, yes. It witholds me from having a job, to finish my studies to get a drivers license, etc. But now that I learned to manage it better it becomes less disruptive. Earlier when I had an episode it took 3 days out of my life: 1 for the dissociation, 1 of being too tired and still groggy too do much beside eating and showering, and 1 still needing much sleep to sleep all the stress off.  Now it's most of the time only half of that. That means a lot for me, since it is quite normal for people not to be productive for a day, so now I can feel more normal. Other people are just having a bad day once in a while, I dissociate once in a while. It's not so severe anymore that I can't hide from the world. Not that I say you should, but it is nice to be able if you want to. I never liked it much if people started to get worried because of my absence and not calling etc. No I can choose whether I want to share it or go with the 'bad day' excuse.  I am chatting too much. I hope it helps you a bit. And know that I feel (at least part of) your pain, confusion, anger, grief about this. And good luck."
ptsd,2zdrew,lddvd,0,Fri Mar 27 22:18:54 2015 UTC,"When I first talked to my psychiatrist she had two others sit in and listen, they all seemed to reluctantly suggest DID, but my official diagnosis is PTSD with dissociative symptoms. (I have had someone who was very sure they knew me call me Sophid before, which is not my name, so its really possible when I think about it.)   The medication I'm on I tried for three months but it didn't change anything, only made for more frequent migraines. My doctor said keep going with it, when I asked for a change in medication (which is a whole other issue) but I felt that I wasn't going to suffer another month of frequent migraines and weaned myself off them instead. I am trying to see another psychiatrist. Mu therapist is awesome and he suggested DID outright and treats me according to that. We haven't started EMDR yet, but I'm looking forward to having the possibility that with less PTSD symptoms, the dissociation will go down or disappear.   I've never had a dissociative episode in which I remembered or even remember entering. It's literally an instant of me doing something, than completely black, than I'm awake again. Although sometimes I have weird dreams and wonder if they may be memories.   It definitely interferes with work, fortunately I have the migraine excuse and I work at a doctors office that is completely understanding of that issue. And yes, I get that it takes some time to heal. When I dissociate it's most often at night, and I probably don't get much sleep therefore, I have to sleep through the day to catch up and it messes up my sleep schedule for a few days.   Anyway, thank you for sharing your experiences. It does help to know others are experiencing the same feelings as me over similar symptoms!

I work at a casual dinning restaurant and deep cleaning is something I have to do from time to time. I feel safe at work so I don't avoid it there, but I do tend to 75% of the time disassociate out and its hard for me to snap back to reality. But cleaning at home is a whole New story. I live with my father and he triggers me a whole lot. If he is in the house its hard for me to do any cleaning and usually I'll break it up over the course of several days doing a little bit at a time because I don't feel comfortable just getting my cleaning over with in just a couple of hours. Whenever I do dishes if I hear sounds I'll get a little freaked out and rush the job because I don't want to be seen. But recently got on medication and things are getting much better in that area, just the other day I was able to do a Shit ton of dishes with him in the room talking with me without freaking out on the inside.

When someone is with me helping clean (or cleaning another part of the house so I don't have to) I feel so much better. I think that's why I posted: because I didn't want to feel alone. I think maybe because I was often abandoned & left to clean impossible messes alone. I remember once when I was quite small, I didn't make it to the bathroom in time to throw up. I was yelled at & degraded for getting sick on the carpet (in the middle of the night). I had hurried, but only made it to the hallway. After my humiliation, a towel was thrown at me & I was told to clean it up ""or else.""  In the darkness, alone, and being quite small (I think I was 5) I remember having a panic attack not knowing what to do, and getting even more sick trying to mop up my own vomit.  I think you're right about feeling safe, and about the vexing brain chemistry! It's so dumb, because cleaning this shelf doesn't mean I'm alone or humiliated or in danger of a violent beating, but my stupid brain doesn't know that. I dissociate, too. ::sigh::  I still haven't started the stupid shelf. I really, really want to...."

ptsd,2z6b0c,8Erinyes8,10,Sun Mar 15 23:31:14 2015 UTC,"You did not deserve what happened to you - what is happening to you - and it is so wrong that your grandfather abused a child's natural sense of trust and love.  Of course you're afraid to trust; that's a completely reasonable response to your formative experiences.   ""At its core, any type of abuse of children constitutes exploitation of the child's dependence on and attachment to the parent."" - Susanne Babbel, Ph.D., MFT   ...or, in your case, grandparent.  There are a couple of things I think you might find helpful:   The Salience Theory of Dopamine - dopamine and paying attention, addiction, PTSD, and child abuse Emotional Neglect and Complex PTSD Learning to Trust After Child Abuse   Speaking of trust, boundaries are so important for both self-care and for rebuilding your ability to trust:   ""A common misconception about boundaries is that they are meant to keep people or feelings out. That’s far from the truth. Boundaries are there to show respect to yourself and others...key to earning and giving trust, which is the foundation of all healthy relationships."" - Alison Chrun   When children experience abusive trauma, it severely affects their ability to securely attach to the caregivers in their lives.  (You can read about attachment here and here.)  In Erikson's stages of development this occurs in different ways throughout the life of the child.  The foundation for everything, however, is love and trust.  What you are seeking (unconditional love and acceptance) but are terrified of seeking (because it makes you vulnerable which experience tells you is unsafe) means that you are stuck.  Choosing between love and safety is a paralyzing choice.  And sometimes it's not depression, or not just depression, but shame.  I highly recommend finding someone you can talk to - good options are therapeutic, but I also highly recommend crisis lines for when you just need someone to listen - and finding ways to parent yourself, to provide yourself unconditional love and support.    Unfortunately, people with traumatic experiences like this often look to others to become their everything, then their world falls apart when the friendship or romance falls apart.  It took me a long time to realize that people who grew up in a functional, healthy home environment don't expect others to meet all of their emotional needs and don't expect those people to be perfect.  People who grew up in functional, healthy home environments had parents, and those children were able to move through each stage of development.  To me, Erikson's stages of development is so important because it is foundational; each step is the foundation for the next.  And when you are looking to re-parent yourself, it is a helpful way to focus on how."

ptsd,2z6b0c,worriedaboutlove,3,Mon Mar 16 03:47:07 2015 UTC,Sorry it took me so long to respond. I went down a rabbit hole and the amount of reading was overwhelming. Thank you so much for your thoughtful post. Is it possible to re-parent yourself? Right now the awareness of how damaged I am is daunting.
ptsd,2z6b0c,invah,10,Tue Mar 17 13:18:26 2015 UTC,"Yes, you can!  The most important part of re-parenting yourself is to realize that your internal monologue, your self talk, may not be your voice.  Children, particularly in the toddler years, internalize their parent's voice and, not only is it incorporated into their 'inner voice', but it is also the foundation for their core beliefs.  Once you realize that your internal voice has been programmed, that it may not be telling you the truth, and that it is a part of the abuse cycle, you can step back from abusing yourself with it.  Parenting yourself is treating yourself the way you should have been treated as a child.  With understanding, with appropriate expectations, with love first, with calm and support.  With the knowledge that who and what you are is enough.  Parents know that a child is not a robot, a child is a person who sometimes has bad days like anyone else.  Parents know that mistakes are not mistakes because they are the trying part of the learning process.  Parents know that being able to do something once doesn't mean you can do it every time thereafter, and on command.  Parents understand that a child grows into having their own boundaries, and that this is important and healthy and function.  Parents let their child be...and become.   Your children are not your children.  They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself.  They come through you but not from you,  And though they are with you yet they belong not to you.  You may give them your love but not your thoughts,  For they have their own thoughts.  You may house their bodies but not their souls,  For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow,  which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams.  You may strive to be like them,  but seek not to make them like you.  For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.  -Excerpted from ""The Prophet"" by Kahlil Gibran   One way to parent yourself is to work through Erikson's Stages of Development.     Develop the ability to trust yourself the way you should have been able to trust your parents as a baby.  Practice self-care and meet your needs...for food, for sleep, for gentle touch. Work on verbalizing and exercising your will; it's okay to take control of your experience and environment.  Honor your word, and also don't commit to things you will find a way not to do.  How can you create your world so it better sees you in it. Don't be afraid to take action.  As Ms. Frizzle would say, ""Take chances! Make mistakes!  Get messy!""  and support yourself no matter the outcome.  People are so quick to take responsibility for every negative, appropriately or not, but shy away from taking credit for the positive. Develop competence, and thereby confidence in yourself and in your skills/abilities. Explore who you are in and of yourself, away from friends, family, co-workers.  What do you think?  How do you feel?  What are your interests?  Allow yourself to become yourself.  Grow stronger in your self-identity.  Who are you?  Strip away context and relationships, and see where you are driven.  What can you not not do?  What do you do no matter what?  What does that say about your values? Learn to love yourself and others healthfully, with appropriate boundaries and expectations. Find something that gives your life meaning to you. Be content in who you are, how you have grown, and what you have done.   I hope this helps.  Edit:  And maybe watch some Mister Roger's Neighborhood and Bob Ross."

ptsd,2z3a8f,bpdhumanity,4,Sun Mar 15 03:51:51 2015 UTC,"Honestly for me?  A lot.  Like, my therapist made it out to be a savior to all of my problems so I just kind of rolled my eyes and brushed it off.  I'd tried to exercise in the past but I always pushed myself way to hard and ended up feeling shaky and miserable.  But something eventually pushed me to try it again in December and I decided to try to start small.  30 seconds of working out every day turned into 2 minutes, then 5, and now I'm up to 10 minutes per day!    I think if you focus on forgiving yourself for your initial limitations and realize that progress will come, then you do a lot better in the long run.  Exercising daily has given me a sense of purpose and pride just because I can commit to SOMETHING.  And it's important to remember that a lot of it is about discipline: do it even when you don't feel like it, ESPECIALLY when you don't feel like it. Abandon any concept of ""motivation"" because you should build yourself up with discipline instead.  Whew, sorry if I rambled but long story short, it helps a lot for me but only if I am kind to myself and recognize that my shortcomings don't make me less-than.   30 seconds of exercise per day is better than nothing and it adds up very quickly!  If you do decide to start an exercise regimen, good luck!  I recommend /r/EOOD or Exercising Out Of Depression, because for me my depression and PTSD pretty much go hand in hand."

ptsd,2z3a8f,invisbleshadow,2,Sun Mar 15 06:41:13 2015 UTC,"A lot. But it's not instant. At first you'll feel shitty after it because your body isn't used to it. Then you'll start to feel a bit looser after exercise, but after 1-2 hours, it goes away. And in between, you'll feel like giving up because goddammit, it's snowing outside. Or you're too anxious to go outside. Or something. But keep going. Make it part of your hygiene habit, like brushing your teeth or showering; sure, your shower is broken and only runs cold water, but you're still going to shower, even if it's for like 2 minutes, right? I don't know if this'll help, but how I managed to make myself go was by asking, ""Will I be productive in the next two hours?"" and if the answer was no (hint: it's usually no), I went to the gym. Then after a few weeks, you'll realize that you can breathe easier and you have more energy to do things. And then you'll realize how much it helps, but you'll also be aware that encouraging people to exercise when they're depressed/anxious doesn't really work that well unless they want to. I always gave people the stink-eye when they suggested I go exercise."

We now know that being socially isolated as adults -- assuming normal childhood here -- is a cause of depression. So a child who was neglected (or abused) socially, by hundreds of people, with no reprieve; who was sent into this systematic exclusion daily, with absolutely no hope of escape and the resignation that it will never get better (edit: and especially considering this child knows nothing but exclusion)...

He was looking into the exact condition I was talking about.  Short story, I find communities have their own definition of what is acceptable. Sadly those definitions are not always correct. Most PTSD comes from rape or time in the military. Some people may be dismissive of people whose PTSD doesn't come from ""traditional"" means of PTSD. Do not let these people invalidate you or what you have been through.  Your teacher was horrible for setting you up to be bullied. If she wanted to teach peace to the students, she should have called them out for not working with ""Iraq"" and seeing past their own views of the country."

I'm going to base this off of my own personal experience and treatment etc., but besides the obvious flames and fire there can be many types of triggers for this character.  I lost a buddy in a plane crash (active military). I have a lot of survivors guilt that comes from mine due to a semi joke/semi serious back and forth we had about him not really wanting to fly that day and that I should just take his flight. There were promises of Apple slices with caramel dipping sauce if I took it. As ridiculous as this may sound, sliced apples and/caramel sauce can trigger me. The songs I was listening to when word came out that communication was lost or when we had confirmation of the crash. The board game I was playing at the same time as the music was playing. The fun activities we were talking about doing once we returned (beaches, boating, etc).  Large groups of people put me on edge. Being away from my home put me on edge.  Reading about plane crashes put me on edge.  Doing my job puts me on edge.  Having said all this you could be surprised as to what CAN be a trigger. Focusing on your character, however, what did your character see involving the fire? How was your character physically involved in the death?  Was he near the fire? Did he feel the heat? Did he hear the house burning or any screams/sounds of his buddy? Triggers can be caused by any of the senses. Smell, sight, sound, etc.  Matches, lighters, smoke. Immense heat from an oven, a scene of someone being burned alive (burned at the stake or in a building) on TV or in a movie. Activities that the two enjoyed doing together. I hope this helped and some other people can give you some help as well."
ptsd,2yu1a8,PhilMuhKracken,4,Thu Mar 12 22:02:24 2015 UTC,"The caramel sauce thing is the key.  Triggers are WEIRD. I was triggered by rural Wal-Marts. Before I figured out I had PTSD, let me tell you that feeling the blood pool in my feet and crying whenever I drove past this one Wal-Mart at the edge of town was confusing.  Throw in something really unusual like that and it will sound even more honest. Obviously it has to tie in somehow, but odd details can imprint strongly in moments that spawn PTSD.

ptsd,2yu1a8,thinking-of-pie,2,Fri Mar 13 17:16:11 2015 UTC,"Wow, this is so much help. Thank you.   The character saw a woman burn to death. This was an intentional homicide by someone who wasn't in their right mind. The  character was given a ""chance"" by the killer to save her by choosing someone else to die. An impossible choice. He acted too slowely, so the killer killed the woman by default. I suppose the killer was trying to pass on his own self-loathing to the character by making him an unwitting participant, whether the character actually had any say in how events unfolded or not.  He was a few feet away from the woman and her son, so he would have seen and smelt her. He would have seen and heard her reaction."
ptsd,2yu1a8,thinking-of-pie,2,Thu Mar 12 22:10:51 2015 UTC,"My mother's a burn survivor with PTSD.   Any kind of cooking meat is going to be a problem for your character and they will probably choose to be vegetarian for some time. TV shows with people burning will be a major deterrent from watching TV (there are no trigger warnings for these things and they tend to just pop up out of nowhere). Character would probably become obsessed with the person who made him 'choose' or obsessed with the victims. Don't be surprised by a period of self-medication. Depending on what happened to the son, the character may get weird around children.  PTSD is essentially a mechanism of memory. Extreme focus on and preoccupation with otherwise minor details -- the color of jewelry, the color of the hair, things other people wouldn't typically notice -- are standard. The mind records it as a means of protecting the person from the same thing later, but with PTSD the reel gets set on repeat.   Reading Trauma and Recovery might help you understand the process, too.  Feel free to PM me if you have specific questions about fire/PTSD in particular -- I'm a writer, too, and have a lot of experience with PTSD (since I also have it, though not from a fire)."

As far as cold goes, remember to wrap up as warm as you can, and if you cant afford clothing you can legitimately find decent warm clothing dumpster diving around clothing boutiques as they often just throw out what they cant sell.

I honestly think you should be proud of yourself for going to the car show knowing it may be a trigger for you. Kudos on that.   I felt alone for years. I held it all inside and when I just couldn't do it anymore and started talking about it then I realized that there are actually a lot of people out there who have PTSD and suffer from the same symptoms. I'm not saying you should just tell anyone, but it is a natural reaction to such traumatic events and that is a fact. And, honestly, you really seem to be on the right track. You seem to have at least a decent relationship with your father, you're doing things you want to do, you're addressing your PTSD and you said yourself that you were/are doing so great.   For me, personally, I try to do something that I enjoy or that takes my mind off of whatever is bothering me. I'm not psychologist, but I find that by doing my best to create good habits and thought patterns/processes that I gradually feel better. Don't let it get you down, keep at it and you'll be rewarded. Social sports also helped.  I know you think that these are physical manifestations of the PTSD triggers, but what if it is not? What if you just ate something or rubbed your eye or nose or something like that without washing your hands beforehand. I guess what I'm saying is that things are not always as they appear and although you've had this psychological reaction to this event, maybe just by knowing that you could be better prepared if another similar event happens.  I've felt broken too, but I find that the less I think about how broken I feel, the more normal I feel, and by normal I mean normal in terms of my estimation of my comfort and my feelings of myself, which is very abstract in itself. I really think you should consider those ideas every time you feel like that. It's better than the alternative. I guess what I am trying to say is that one of the symptoms of PTSD is not perceiving reality as it exists and not making rational decisions. After doing a lot of things myself that were not rational and often from perceptions not constituting an accurate representation of reality, I'm really just trying to help you out in your future dealings with PTSD, even if I unintentionally offended you a bit.  On a more personal note, these things happen. I'm really and honestly sorry you had to experience that. But the clock doesn't stop ticking, the world keeps turning and you just kinda have to keep going on. And go straight at it. Aim right for what you want to do and do it. Some famous dead white author said ""we should all do that which we are afraid to do,"" and I believe that is a big part of the secret to getting over PTSD, albeit sometimes to be done with baby steps, just do what you want to do. Not everybody out there is like that person, or whatever you want to call him, and most people are very homely and forthcoming. I'm not sure your story exactly but I know my grandmother had PTSD from a similar experience to what you described and you literally wouldn't be able to tell anything happened, and she laughs and jokes and speaks her mind just as much as anybody we'd look up to would. So, keep it up, you're on the right track I can tell. Don't let it get you down, keep your head up, your wits sharp and remember what you've got deep down, and I can tell there's a lot of good stuff in there, and you'll be fine."

ptsd,2ye2gk,cocoanutter,1 point,Mon Mar 9 22:30:02 2015 UTC,"You are not alone. It's crazy how our minds can so directly affect our bodies, even if it's not an instantaneous reaction.  Just because you feel that experience eventually got the best of you, doesn't mean PTSD is winning. You did something you're proud of, facing a potential trigger and enjoying the time with your dad while there. Nothing can take that away. Sure, maybe it had a negative-feeling effect on you later, but you still did it and took that risk! That's a win, I'd say.    As for not having a normal life, I know what you mean and most others here probably do as well; you're not alone. Maybe we won't all ever be 100% symptom-free, but we can sure as hell conquer each day to the best of our abilities and choose to view that as a great accomplishment in itself.  We have to put in a lot more effort in day-to-day routines than people who don't deal with the things we do, and being able to go on day after day is a success.  It takes time and consistent retraining of your thought process, but try to imagine yourself as strong and successful within that frame of things rather than ""not normal"" or ""broken."" Maybe you aren't the same person as you were before your trauma, but who ever stays the same person they were? Life is about growing, changing, and discovering; your experience is something you didn't choose to have happen, but in one way or another you'll have learned something from it (i.e. a coping mechanism that turns out to be beneficial for you, such as exercise or meditation; learning who your true support system consists of).  You're not broken, just different now.   I hope something in my writing here resonates with you and is helpful. <3"
ptsd,2ye2gk,beaufordtshimbucket,0,Tue Mar 10 13:41:35 2015 UTC,I can't say that our Ptsd is the same. And that's the point. Ptsd stems from your bodies response to tramatic shock. Consult your primary care doctor about the physical issues and then find a good therapist to help you break the emotional knots caused by the shock. You may have to shop counselors to find a fit. And finally Ptsd is real and can be treated with help. Hope this helps.

ptsd,2y4iol,mydaddyisadrunkass,1 point,Fri Mar 6 21:23:32 2015 UTC,"I get that.   I learned to find a middle ground with most friends. I can say ""I'm really sad and wound up today"" but it's a very very small number who want (or need) to know why. If they pry, I will feed them info in tiny bits to see how they react. I have found a few people to be way more sensitive than I imagined.   Most people will understand that sad is sad even if they don't get details. I would like to be able to tell more people, but that's why therapists get paid, right?"

When I tell people that I have PTSD, I can't just leave it at that because they've usually only ever heard of it in connection with military service.

ptsd,2y2ric,remydarling,13,Mon Mar 23 15:02:44 2015 UTC,PTSD can be caused simply by seeing things that are traumatic. That in itself is an experience. That in itself can cause trauma. Please do not let yourself feel worse by those who do not understand the illness.

Despite talking to my doctors about my situation, I was overlooked repeatedly until MUCH later on -- and I suffer from PTSD through a combat-scenerio. People are dismissive a lot of the time. It's not intentional, they just assume you'll 'walk it off' eventually. Finding the -right- doctor will help, but that search can be seemingly endless. Take comfort in your wife, and continue to look for a doctor that actually -listens- to you. It may take awhile, but in the end, it'll be extremely worthwhile."

ptsd,2y2ric,DocBrutus,12,Fri Mar 6 04:40:44 2015 UTC,"Ptsd is a weird mental illness because it is one that people can get almost instantly and in a lot of situations. Kind of like a broken leg; you can fall down the stairs, get hit by a car, slip on some ice, you can think of a million other ways. The weird part is you can also develop it, like a tumor or a blood clot it can grow over a long period of time.  Publicly, ptsd is still in this really early phase of understanding, sort of like when we used to think milk soured because a demon got in it. People point as someone with ptsd and say, ""he went through hell,"" like hell is some place that we stumbled upon. They don't understand that PTSD is a reaction to when a brain is put under so much pressure it breaks and this is not something you can wrap up in a cast or get a doctor to screw back together; we are simply stuck with whatever is left over.   Until people realize PTSD is an injury and not a Medal of Honor or some achievement for clearing life on hard mode, the majority of us will go unseen in our pain."

ptsd,2y2ric,revmyk,1 point,Fri Mar 6 12:40:25 2015 UTC,"I think the biggest reason why most people associate PTSD with combat is that for the longest time, that's how the medical community understood it. The phenomenon was first observed in veterans from WWI, and at the time it was referred to as shell-shock. All these early associations were reinforced by later research. Most studies I have seen (quite a few as I'm in the field of psychology) use soldiers in combat or survivors of sexual assault as their participants. And most of the current knowledge we have of the disorder came from studying Vietnam vets.   This has all been picked up by various media - countless books, movies, tv shows, comics, etc. reference PTSD from combat. And Hollywood is slow to move on, so while mental health professionals know that PTSD can be caused by any traumatic event, most laymen do not."

Yeah, society does have some judgmental people, especially when someone has been in a psych ward.  However, I feel that your sample is providing a false positive.  If you interact with the right people in the right environments (like what remydarling suggested), you'll find the love and support that you NEED in order to learn to process what's happened to you.  It really sucks because the people we want to trust most in this world (friends, even family) can be the cruelest when we seek support for the traumas we've suffered.  Some people just don't get it, and sometimes the people that don't get it are the ones we WANT to help us with our troubles.  I too suffer from PTSD from a long-term abusive relationship and sexual assault--a concept many people can't grasp because I'm a large man--and I too have had people be dismissive of my trauma.  What happened to you sucks.  I truly and honestly wish that you never had that experience, as it's sucked out a lot of faith in humanity.  I promise you, though, that there ARE people that will care.  There ARE people that want you to be happy.  You just have to find them.  The rest, I hate to say, don't need to hear what's happened.  Pick your confidantes wisely.  Be selective with who you trust.  There are people you can be friends with that don't need to hear your story--your trauma DOESN'T define you--and there are people you can shrewdly tell your story to that will help you through it."

Also it's really important to be useful and practical in the recommendations made to users and avoid judgement. For example, with sleep monitoring, I have zero use for an app that tells me I need to sleep more, I already know that. But HOW?  how do you make yourself sleep when you can't sleep, and can't afford another doctor or habit-forming prescription?  Stick to practical, real-life advice from professionals, and avoid telling people what they already know.

I'm curious as to how activities will be categorized as helpful or harmful.  For example, self-harm, while a maladaptive coping strategy in the long run, is very grounding for me and helps ease some of my immediate symptoms.   Another example might be therapy.  Working with my therapist has absolutely helped me improve over time, although immediately following a session (and sometimes days afterwards) my symptoms can be wayyy worse.   What about dissociation?  There are times when I may be more ""functional"" and have fewer obvious symptoms, but I'm actually dissociated.  As I work on inhabiting my body and work through memories and emotions, I may feel more distressed and be more symptomatic, but actually feeling it is a good thing!  PTSD is so complicated and unique to the individual that I imagine this app would have to be very personalized and specific to be helpful.  How comprehensive are you imagining this would be?"

I think the first and most important thing to do is to learn when to let things go. Having said that, rumination is tough as tits to get passed. But still, working at it little bits at a time helps.  Another thing I do to try and stay positive is to let the negativity out little bits at a time. My friends and loved ones know me best for my foul mouth and short fuse, but most of them are aware that letting things out that way helps me stay grounded without getting bogged down. In my mind, it's better to be visibly annoyed at the time, than let one thing after another stew. And, of course, you don't have to be a foul mouth to do it. (But I do highly advise it, cuss words are therapeutic.)  Lastly I think everyone needs to take time for themselves as often as possible. At least once a day for an hour.

My advice would be to force yourself to go to bed at the same time every night, no matter how awake you feel. Don't use a phone or computer about an hour before you go up to bed. Read a book in fairly dim lighting with a hot chocolate and you may find your eyes drooping before too long. You could try herbal sleeping pills (Quiet Life or Kalms), they knock you straight into a deep sleep which makes you feel more energised in the morning. If you have a smart phone, set your phone's alarm to go off every 5 minutes or so. What I do too is wrap up in the duvet and appreciate the comfort, until I get so hot that I have to take the duvet off. Then I get up. It's all about will power though.

ptsd,2xusng,euphoricjam,2,Wed Mar 18 02:29:52 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much! Im glad to hear you found value in it!  Its really is hard to take the step of getting help. Honestly, the hardest part is finding the right person, because you need to be able to trust them, at least to some degree. Finding the right person can happen, of course, and to that regard, I truly felt counselling was my saving grace; but it should also be kept in mind that some people actually feel self help if better for them. Regardless of what she feels best with, its always important for her to be ready for what she's doing, and not to force anything, as that really doesnt help.  Im not sure exactly what she's going through, so I dont know how helpful this may be, but some reading she can do on her own, without any counselling, is in the following book:  Mind Over Mood by Dennis Greenberger and Christine Padesky  Here is a google book link: http://books.google.ca/books/about/Mind_Over_Mood.html?id=omJwsphImoYC  Unfortunately I suck at searching, but if you're good at finding things, Im told a full version can be found for free, somewhere on the net - otherwise that google book may be able to still offer some source of help to her :)  If I may offer one suggestion in terms of your desire to encourage her to go to counselling, it would be to maybe consider discussing the idea with her that she's never actually tried it before, and thus, she cant actually know if it will help or not. As long as you let her know she is in no way obligated to go again, if she has a bad experience on her first try, then theres no reason not to be open minded about the possibility that it COULD possibly help. There really are others, such as myself, who have truly benefited from it, as evidence!   But again, its always good to keep in mind that people can only do these things when they are ready - forcing doesnt help, but rather, often only seems to facilitate resistance to grow further... I really hope she is able to find a path to healing that works for her - and on that note, thank you so very much for being there for her! Having someone nearby who cares and at least tries to understand, really does make all the world of difference for those suffering from ptsd, or any mental health issue for that matter!

I am on my second Therapist, who is lovely- make sure they are a good fit, as you will be opening up and revealing sides of yourself you have tried to hide from for years. (I only saw the first therapist 4 times). EMDR is horrifying and wonderful at the same time. Good luck!"

Unfortunately it doesn't help my short term memory. But the alternative is much worse.   I was not a smoker before. But after being diagnosed I tried it and it really has helped me get through the days and nights.   Of course, it's not for everyone but if you haven't tried and are able to, why not?   Good luck. :)"
ptsd,2xr5lk,ithinkimay,2,Tue Mar 3 05:53:13 2015 UTC,"I was also afraid that taking meds would get rid of my hyper vigilance... I was afraid if I took the prazosin, I wouldn't be able to hear my psyco ex break in at night.   Ask you doctor if you can up the dose...1mg is just a low starter dose.  You have to get used to it first (it can make you dizzy at first) and sure that you don't have any side effects.  Prazosin is not a sedative so you'll still be able to wake up if you hear a noise....it blocks the adrenaline so you can relax a bit and with the right dose, hopefully prevent nightmares.  I don't have nightmares when I take it.  Going to therapy can be hard...especially at first.  Stick with it though!  You'll learn what triggers you and learn different ways to calm yourself down when you're panicked/ upset.  I does feel better to tell someone something that you've been holding inside.  Don't rush it...little at a time.    Going to the gym or playing a sport might help you burn off some of that energy."

ptsd,2xr5lk,njerome,2,Tue Mar 3 15:48:50 2015 UTC,"A lot of people using booze to sleep eventually reach a point where they feel like they're using too much, and realize they can't stop when they try. Your family is worried you'll fall into the same trap, and for good reason.  There are lots of sedatives that are less addictive than alcohol. Even if you end up dependent on sleeping pills to sleep, that's still less harmful than being dependent on alcohol. On the non-sedative front, there are plenty of things other than Prazosin if increasing your dose isn't an option.  Cannabis has worked wonders for my bedtime anxiety, got me off sedatives completely, and stemmed the urge to drink before bed as well. If it's legal-ish where you are, I highly recommend it."
ptsd,2xr5lk,Centropomus,2,Tue Mar 3 18:12:34 2015 UTC,"I know you don't want to hear it, but constant hypervigilance is exhausting, and being tired all the time means you're not at your best. It leaves you in a state where instead of being able to respond to situations appropriately, you always over-react. Instead of always being ready, you're actually not prepared for anything (normal) at all. It takes a toll on your body, as well (increased blood pressure, increased levels of fight-or-flight hormones, etc), which makes you more vulnerable to health problems. Not exactly a good thing.  Is therapy just medication, or is there more to it? If it's just meds, see about changing dosage or kind. If there's also a non-drug component, understand that sometimes it gets worse before it gets better, and you just need to stick it out a bit longer.   I'd suggest meditation (to quiet your mind), and physical activity, even just going for a walk every day (to relieve excess energy). Journaling and/or some form of creative expression can help too. You want to get to a point where you control your mind; it doesn't control you. And if you don't want your family to be afraid of you, you need to be able to control your response to them. Being left alone to cool off isn't always an option, and even when it is, you can end up pushing everyone away."

Your family does understand to the best that anyone can who has NOT experienced what you have.  The problem is they just don't know how to help.  You aren't hurting your family.  They hurt because they can't help you.  Your family loves you and would give anything to help you. I also want you to know that there are many people out here in America who love and respect you for your service and sacrifice.  Who want nothing more than to support and help you.  Who also don't know how to help you fix what you've been through but we are here and are willing to reach out.  I pray for every one of you every single day.  I teach class after class to respect this nation and the Veterans who have, do, and will serve.  I do it in your honor.  All I can say to you is what I ask God for my son every day is to bring you peace and show you how to forgive and how to allow yourself to believe that it is possible that a LOVING God does exist and that He will someday bring justice to this planet and if He can do that, He can help bring peace to your soul and bring you to an understanding that there is a purpose for what you've been through it's in a bigger plan that none of us can understand right now but we will someday.  Keep putting each foot forward, when you fall, remember you have all of us out here with you, right beside you helping you up and if we could take the step for you we would, all we can do is hold you and support you and beg God to give you the strength.  You are loved.  Don't give up.  Your behavior isn't crazy.  It's justified."

All in all it cost about $3 and the scissors, notebook and glue lasted months. Countless hours of therapy for $3 is definitely worth it. Even if you don't have a photocopier you can do incredible things with the material available around you.  It doesn't matter if it becomes presentable work, if you keep it or if it looks good.

For some people, exercise is a great release, plenty of health advantages already documented.   What do all of these have in common?

Exercising has me feeling stronger and better about myself - and endorphins are great too! It helps get me into a better mood, and also lessons my anxiety.  Eating well has me having more energy and feeling better and more clear headed. Even just the process of cooking seems to have a positive impact for me - I never used to cook much, so even just the process of cooking/following a recipe/etc gives my head something to focus on and keeps me grounded and in the moment - and it's even more of a plus when it comes out tasting great!

My advice to you is to stick with mturk. I don't know how long you have been trying to make it work but keep trying.  Get your numbers up. Install Hit Scraper and use Turkopticon to avoid the bad requesters so you don't get needless rejections.  Do all the hits you can do to get your numbers up and more things will open up and you will make more money. Get all the qualification you can. ProductRNR is a good one to get because it is autogranted to anyone. They don't reject (they will just remove your qual if you perform poorly.)

I want you to be healthy and not have such extreme paranoia that you feel this way.  I suspect most share that view.  I believe you should question your views and your acceptance of certain situations in your past.  If you have been abused, accept that- somehow- I know that it is hard, but you have to live today even though someone stole yesterday from you.  If you don't you are just letting them win.  If you don't you are choosing to give them all your tomorrow's just because you can't accept that something happened in the past and leave it there.    There is no one hiding in your bushes to take you away, but if you run down the street screaming about society trying to torture and kill you- that everyone is out to get you and dangerous- you might find a self fulfilling prophecy at least to the extent of finding yourself locked in the very institution you decry.   Pretend everyone is crazy and aliens, if it helps.  Pretend that if you don't convince everyone you are healthy your fear will come true.  You believe it is true, so you are basically already doing this.  But what I'd like you to find out is that whether you believe your fear rational or not, if you carry on your life like the fear is not true I suspect you will have many days of evidence to lean on that prove to yourself you can allow the fear less control."

I absolutely understand having unrational fear (or a 'rational' fear at unrational times).  I get that you have PTSD from your experience and life.  My point is you are scapegoating it and claiming in threads all over how that fear is 'completely rational' because the world is out to get you.  I am saying I have a rational fear of them and an awareness having been in one.  You can have both and it not be PTSD, but sometimes we get, have, and experience stresses / attacks from things that when we break through denial and work on them, we find are not completely rational, or at times it is not rational to be fearful.    I am just trying to help you see that just saying this is a rational paranoia, doesn't actually make it so.  Feeling like it is, doesn't make it so (BUT I totally understand how it doesn't matter to our feelings).

So what do you think the definition of mental health institutions is?  What do you think it should be?   They all do.   They cannot all, there are two people in this conversation and in the psyche ward I went to as a late teen I did not see or experience abuse.  The drugs were carefully chosen and monitored, no one was beat.  I had a frightening confrontation with a large roommate, but they heard me defend myself, came and used the minimum amount of force necessary to restrain him.    So of the two of us, one has seen one institution this was not the case.  When you define what you think mental health institutions should be known as, you will have to leave out the all-or-nothing extremes like    They all do.   From another post of yours it really seemed more like your therapist understands your fear and also has told you they cannot help you completely get rid of a rational fear.  If your therapists really believe what you said here:   My therapists are aware of my fear and still say that it's impossible to fix.   then you really need new ones.  They can even help with 'rational' fears by providing new ways we can process it or helping us react in healthier ways.  Maybe your definition will help me see why this is a rational fear, if it is then I should be more scared too.

In order for something to truly be of someone's consent, they have to be able to have an option not to do whatever it is and they have to be able to back out whenever they want. That's not the case.   Psych wards also cause suicide. People leave all the time having learned nothing but that it's unsafe to tell people about their problems (want proof? about a quarter of /r/suicidewatch posts say that exactly). It is also dehumanizing and strips people of their basic human rights, and suicide/suicidal thoughts are common after traumatic events.  If you had had a panic attack while being there, they would have drugged you, guaranteed. If someone doesn't want to be there and tries to get away, they get physically assaulted. That happens in every psych ward."
ptsd,2xfgzx,Shanguerrilla,3,Sat Feb 28 08:22:40 2015 UTC,"I agree with this completely. I was drugged and sexually abused in rehab when I was 18 and then last year was in the metal ward for suicide and they basically act like you are not a human being at all. I was in there for PTSD/CPTSD for all kinds of things but a lot for sexual abuse and rape and they let one of their patients stalk me and corner me sexually. When told about it, they just told me whenever he came in the room I should leave. Another patient actually had to step in and stop him from doing something to me in the hallway. They talk about you and make decisions for you, not to keep you safe, but just so they don't have to deal with you. If it really was about healing they would offer more than meds and daytime TV. There was one or two group therapy sessions the week I was there and the ""counseling"" was just really getting your background and figuring out meds. No tools or help of any other kind. I could say so much more :(   What are you going to do?"

Thank you for posting because a lot of the time, people have either been told that the abuse is for their own good so much that they're on the abusers side or they're too afraid of being locked up again to speak out. Being a victim of this can be really iscolating because of that.  I'm seeing about going back to high school. I have things figured out where I could have classes only in the morning until 11:45 and graduate in two years. I don't know if they'll let me do that (the school system is known for being unaccepting of disablities and necessary accommodations) I'm scared it'll keep me trapped here for those two years, but maybe it'll give me a chance to save up and get out. I don't know. I have to try to do something or I'll be trapped here forever. EDIT: they said I'm too old. I guess I'm going to be stuck here until I die.  I'm also going to get a referral to a new psychiatrist. Just because one was batshit insane doesn't mean there's no one willing to help me."

Go here when you need to and stay until you feel safe.  Third: Be sure you have an ICE (in case of emergency) contact in your phone. I used my best friend as my ICE because she could explain to EMS why I could not talk if I was found wandering and lost. Your SO would probably be a good choice. Just in case, you know?

This was a totally foreign concept so I also had to learn to test it in a healthy way and to set some realistic and healthy boundaries. All a work in progress but progressing and I know you can practice too.  You can't see something you don't have evidence of so you can start by deciding what evidence you need. Ex: can you trust your landlord? How much trust is trust (100%? 90%?) and is it ok to have limited trust of your landlord? I trust my landlord to take my rent, protect his property, but I know I can't trust him to return my calls for a few days and that's ok (90% trust). I trust him because my needs are met and our interactions are well defined in advance.   Little steps and explore. You can do this."

Additionally, sub-syndromal traumatic stress symptoms are also not PTSD.  Trauma is a common word these days, and it describes a range of experiences quite well - however, PTSD as a diagnosis should not necessarily be used to describe a kind of ""trauma"".   I can't say that PTSD could not be developed from the suicide of a friend (I'm assuming that you did not witness the event, find the body, or were part of the body's recovery) but I think that not only should the specifics of your psychic distress be detailed for clarity, but that a mis-diagnosis of PTSD could prevent you from gaining the kind of treatment that would more accurately address your symptoms."

The healing doesn't occur at a predictable rate; some people feel improved after a few sessions with a counselor, others struggle.  One thing that seems to work for me is sticking with it.  I have to remind myself that I'm not a failure simply because a day isn't going well, and / or I'm distracted when I try to focus on something more productive.  I remind myself of the stream of consciousness, witnessing distracting thoughts, and just watching them go by, without grabbing onto them and obsessing over the negativity that produced them.  If your hyperhidrosis is a source of anxiety, would working out help?  Imagine how impressed people must be when they see this woman working out with a healthy sweat going.  Bear in mind I don't know you, but often people are their own worst critics, playing sounds bites from bad parenting in their heads over and over when they're having a bad day or such.

I know it sounds hard and useless but perhaps try your best to make yourself feel the best physically. Like wash your sheets, shave your legs and tuck yourself in with your SO and be comfy and do know that this is something that you can recover from. Every smile you have from this day forth will be a very powerful coping tool in the future when things start to weigh on you.

Make sure you don't isolate but find friends who don't have kids. Don't hide in alcohol that shit don't help. Find the one thing you love or are fucking awesome at.

S/he can help you process your emotions. There's also a kind of therapy called EMDR you might investigate. A book I read on it was fascinating, seems to really help people process and move on. Reach out to the clinic where you had the procedure and ask about any resources they might have  - you're not alone. Take care of yourself!"

The fact that it's a current stressor instead of a past one doesn't mean that your therapist can't help you -- if you're established somewhere, call them and tell them you need to get in.  This is the type of issue that you can recover from, but also that you have to be gentle with yourself about. By this, I mean not seeking help from places where you likely won't' receive it (anti-abortion friends, for example) and making it more difficult on you. Contact your therapist -- they're trained to help you work through life events, both past AND present."

ptsd,2wx6jr,stuffandthingsetcetc,1 point,Mon Feb 23 23:40:33 2015 UTC,"Shopping was my coping skill, but I quit cold turkey when I canceled all my credit cards. And eating I guess. I'm just going to take a nap and went over to my boyfriends because my house is a cluttered chaotic mess that I fail at keeping clean and am consistently reminded of (well not really, but it feels that way).   You guys at least understand how triggering this is. It's more than just getting rejected by an employers it's essentially being told we don't want you back and that your service was not worth anything. Its happened numerous times with different employers no matter how hard I try I never receive recognition for anything I do. I only ever get told I'm unprofessional and ""not a good fit"" Hell I was terminated from my first professional experience after winning the agency an award and essentially saving a program and deferring grad school for a year to spend more time on my project.   I talk to my parents about this and I'm told to get over it, to stop feeling sorry for myself etc. Whereas, my sister has been in therapy since she was three and when she disclosed she had an eating disorder was immediately encouraged to attend therapy including an inpatient program. Through all those years of bullying, my own struggles with disordered eating, and two hospitalizations I was never forced to attend thearpy. Yes my parents tried to help by changing schools (I went to two middle schools and two high schools because of bullying) I was never forced to continue getting help. All the while well being made to feel unattractive and only worth anything if you achieved traditional measures of professional success.   I keep telling this story and no one has been able to help, they just run away . Friends, parters, etc. I never really had friends growing up, and the people I considered friends always found someone more important. The only thing ""stable"" in my life was the relationship with my parents whose consistent judging , competitiveness, and creating hierarchies as well as consistent jabs at me about my weight (I have PCOS) and desire to control everything I put in my mouth is why I have no fucking self worth.   So yeah that's why this is triggering."
ptsd,2wx6jr,Samuel_Bellamy,1 point,Tue Feb 24 00:15:30 2015 UTC,"You could look into SSI disability. It isn't a fun process by any means but it works for some folks and if you feel like you are running out of options it could be worth a shot. When applying you should be certain not to downplay how difficult things are, its the right time to all-out complain.  It isn't a hell of a lot of money and it isn't glamorous or prestigious, but it is a good small step. Small steps are a lot more pleasant and you're a lot less likely to fall on your face. This wouldn't have to be for long either, but it could give you time to face the causes of your discontent not just its manifestations. It could give you some time figure yourself out and figure out what your next step should be.  If you don't feel like trying this now I understand, it isn't for everyone. If this is the case I would suggest talking to the Department of Vocational Rehabilitation; I have some familiarity with both the DVR and SSI disability departments in your state and they can be a lot of help (I looked at your other posts here to make sure I'm not redundant).  None of this is easy or fun compared to applying for, and being rejected from, jobs. The process would likely be rife with triggers as well, but it is slightly different than what you are doing now and maybe it could be good enough for now.  If you want I can PM you the contact info for these services. Good luck with everything."
ptsd,2wx6jr,Centropomus,1 point,Tue Feb 24 04:39:58 2015 UTC,"I worked with DVR for clients at my other jobs and found them to not only be not helpful, but also triggering due to my close association. In my experience, DVR is just a funding mechanism for other community service providers which would not take me because my CPSTD is not serious enough and while I feel what I have achieved is miniscule, they think it is a great accomplishment. So, yeah SSI/DVR is not an option. Its ironic, but working gives me a sense of purpose and taking away that sense of purpose is devastating. Maybe if I can't find something long after 4/15 and unemployment runs out or I am not eligible. I also live in a state where they have not expanded medicaid so that is off the table. What I really need is group health insurance where I am paying $10-$20 a therapy session, not $50. I had this at my old job and didn't connect the dots that the reason I felt so shitty and missed so much work in a job that made those who did not have prior mental health problems crazy was because of the trauma combined with the unclear expectations of my boss and a loss of control over my work."

Spare you the story, but that almost killed me a second time.   Don't feel like you're missing out on the MyPTSD forums. There are about two worthwhile resources on that site, and a whole truckload of unhealthy/unhelpful. It's come up here a couple of times. You won't get people talking about the real negative stuff publicly for fear of further retaliation from the people who run that place. It may not make you feel less lonely at the moment, but hey-- you've protected yourself from some more harm. That's positive, right?  Tips? Tricks? Hmm. Embrace the bleak. No, seriously. What helped me the most was to stop trying to find ""anywhere to turn""-- or anyone else for that matter. I educated myself-- I read a lot. Less the self-help stuff and more the books written for clinicians. What really helped me was understanding how trauma, and thus traumatic memories, were handled. This let me understand the batshit insanity I was thinking/feeling/displaying at times. As I was able to make more sense of what was going on with  me. I found that just understanding WHY things were happening was far more valuable than any of the BS the fake-therapists (social workers, ""technicians"", etc-- the rotating crew you're subjected to if you can't afford top notch care).   I'm not doing the tough-love thing when I say this. Don't look for support: be your support. If others come along and are ever so slightly useful? Great-- but the more you hope to rely on them, the more you'll just be let down.   On a less philosophical and more practical note: establish a safe space."

It's not on the table for me, and, going by past experience, probably wouldn't be too useful. I wanted to be up front about my situation so I didn't get too many responses about seeing someone.  I know what you mean about education being so important - although I can't spring for the books, I've spent the months since my diagnosis searching, downloading, researching. Being able to understand the whys and hows of my disorder has absolutely been a valuable resource, particularly with anxiety and certain issues with dissociation. For a while, I thought that was enough.  Unfortunately, that's no longer the case.  I want to be my own support. I'm not. My best is a miserable mess that only leaves drama and stress in its wake - most recently, my friends were banned from hanging at a favourite haunt because of one of my episodes. Maybe 90% of the time I can ride out the maelstrom, but 10% of the time, I can't. There are people who, for the first time in twenty years, I'm learning to trust, so I don't think shoving that down and trying to be ""independent"" the way I've always been is a great idea (it's what had me hospitalized in May.) It's the easy road to take and always leads to more problems. I don't know what to do, so I'm asking questions.  Which I appreciate you're taking the time to answer. I agree with everything you've said - educate yourself, take care of yourself, don't make yourself dependent - it's just that right now I'm obviously in need of a quick fix.

My key is I got to stay busy. Stay running. Don't stop to think. I realize that you are unemployed...and that hurts you in a LOT of ways. You can't provide for yourself. You get that self loathing and shit. But even worse, you got that down time when all you got to do is be inside your fucking head. That's where I was when my drinking was out of control.   I found a job where most people would never agree to do. I don't even like it that much (I got a severe fear of heights), but it keeps me insanely busy. I never know what country I will be sent to and its usually short notice. That's my coping mechanism.   In reality, I'm not getting any better...I'm just existing. This is the decision and the world I chose to live in. Most people would never see this as healthy or normal, but its what I have decided to do vice topping myself via the bottle.   Keep talking.

What we can do is show up everyday and train to be the best candidate for the job. Your experience puts you ahead of many, many EMT candidates.   Of course it is important to take a balanced approach to your progress and go in with a healthy mind, but talking about it and planning to go back is a huge sign of progress you should be very proud of.

ptsd,2wtlcs,spades593,1 point,Mon Feb 23 09:12:54 2015 UTC,"I used this one - https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/binaural-pure-binaural-beats/id838752522?mt=8  I set it to the middle of the delta range, around 1.5 Hz. Maybe play it at a lower volume, or for a shorter length of time? Like start for five minutes and work your way up to twenty to thirty. Again, the study suggested the delta/theta range so maybe that would help as well.  It's 2am here, the insomnia witching hour, and obviously I'm up. But, I'm not sure if I'm awake because of my disorder or because my dog was licking my ear. She's used to me waking up at this hour so maybe we have a training issue, lol. I'm still really relaxed feeling, though I noticed those anxiety inducing intrusive thoughts are creeping in.  It's kinda fun post my experience though - For Science!"

I put a low theta beat on to see how that affected me. Well, it made me more anxious. Enlightening! So after twenty minutes, I switched back to a low delta beat and I must have fallen asleep fairly quickly because I didn't get but a couple of paragraphs into the article I was reading.  I would suggest experimenting with the different beats and different Hz within the beats to see if one is more effective for you than another. Try different volumes, and different time lengths too. This morning I'm back to being a little emotionally fragile, but my anxiety is at a very low hum, which is highly unusual for me.  This has been fun, I hope someone else finds just a little tiny bit of relief. If you do, please let me know - FOR SCIENCE!"
ptsd,2wsgwx,Downwitthesickness,3,Sun Feb 22 20:02:27 2015 UTC,You need a reward to motivate you step by step until you get out the door so you can re-set your pattern.  Get a special coffee or tea for the morning. Be sure you have honey or whatever to make it special for you. A favorite fruit in the fridge?   Set out a work outfit that makes you feel confident and comfortable. Wear nice underwear and shoes. A little pre-grooming the night before will make it easier to look in the mirror the next morning.  Is there someone at work you look forward to seeing? Send them a text and mention you missed them and will be in tomorrow. Set up a lunch or coffee catch up so you have something to look forward to.  Put a few things in your desk that you will want to access as a reward. A super healthy snack. A picture that makes you smile. Give yourself something to look forward to when you sit down to work.   Repeat Monday through Friday for one week and see how it feels.

My ex was very abusive and has threatened to kill me many times...my fear is that he will kill me so when I'd fill out that worksheet, it would look something like this:  Feeling: Panic, scared  Thought:  Saw a car that looked just like my ex's car on my street...he's going to kill me  Edvidence to support this thought:  He is very violent and probably very angry about his criminal charges.  He has hurt me and threatened to kill me.  Evidence that goes against that thought:  Since going to the police and getting the restraining order, he hasn't hurt me  Positive spin on that thought:  Maybe he will leave me alone, maybe he won't kill me.

You're not doomed to be terrified forever, because the vast majority of the time, you're not in actual dangerous situations. Your therapist is right that no therapy will make reasonable fears stop (and you wouldn't want them to, because the fear response is valid and useful in the face of real danger), but most fears are not reasonable. Therapy will help you navigate your fears, and learn which ones are about true danger, and which ones you can work to eliminate. There will be times you feel afraid, no matter how successful your therapy is, but you learn to let fears go when they're no longer useful to you."

If I sound incredibly cheesy, feel free to ignore me :)  My brain started ""turning on"" my emotions very recently, maybe because I'm dissociating less, and I'm ready to handle them. I got the gift of anger first, a very specific anger towards certain people who had tried to ruin years of my life.  I think sadness, horniness, and another type of anger from my childhood (""why won't they leave me the fuck alone?!!!!#$!%"") were turned on after that.  It was overwhelming at first (especially horniness, which made my life uncomfortable for a week, heheh) but now that I've experienced them, they don't seem scary, or antagonistic.

ptsd,2wmmiw,Keeweebear42,3,Sun Feb 22 05:27:55 2015 UTC,I lived only in my head for a long time. Getting comfortable living in your body is really hard and takes time. Be patient with yourself and forgiving.   Try to think of it like moving into a new apartment. All the light switches are in different places. At first you can find your way to the bathroom at night without turning on a light. But given enough time and practice moving into your body you will be comfortable and happy there.    I started getting comfortable in my body by doing yoga and focusing on how each pose felt. Pick a method of 'feeling in your body' that doesn't make you so uncomfortable you want to stop.   One of the benefits of living in my body instead of just in my mind: when I get triggered by or upset by something I always know immediately because I retreat to my mind and I can feel that.   The real life applications of this are the same as the real life applications of using a certain tool. Your body is the tool that you use to collect information about the world around you and interact. Without that collected information or interaction there wouldn't be any stimulation of the brain or our mental self. Get comfortable feeling in your body and learn how to use it as a tool.   Take a deep breath and be kind to yourself.

Basically you pick something scary to focus on, and then go as far into it as you feel comfortable while watching either a moving object or a moving light.  If you feel a solid sense of trust in the therapist, it shouldn't be awful in itself.   Based on my own experiences (I've been through two rounds of EMDR myself and they were both very helpful with the issues we targeted, but the experience was quite different each time) and what I've heard from others, it's quite variable both on what the experience is like and how helpful it is, but it's a pretty safe thing to try, and when it works, it seems to really work.

ptsd,2wkthk,Alien_512,3,Fri Feb 20 19:21:12 2015 UTC,"Iit is not unreasonable to want your SO to understand their role in your ptsd.   Anyone interested in a long term partnership should desire to understand how they can help/harm their partner. It's part of partnership.  You might feel below him because he seems to be sneering at your condition. Sometimes self care is not enough, and you should both know and accept him limits and abilities to support you.   If you are working this out in therapy, then you are actively working to heal and manage your end of things. A little whining is the same as bitching about a boss, not more, not less. If you were just sitting  in bed, not addressing your issues, and refusing to seek help while whining that would be another matter. You have a right to share your discomfort.  He might need an easier relationship. Not because you are complicated, but because he might not have it in him to be an adult partner. Just as he needs to know and accept your limits, you need to know and accept his.  And be extra kind to yourself. It sucks when someone you care about doesn't seem to get it. A little pampering of you won't hurt while you process this."
ptsd,2wkthk,mydaddyisadrunkass,1 point,Sun Feb 22 05:03:02 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry that you feel like you don't deserve this relationship. Or like he's doing you a favor by putting up with you. That is a really difficult place to be, especially when you're already dealing with trauma.  But, I'd like to tell you what I believe. First of all, you aren't too emotional. That depth of feeling that you are experiencing, and the work you are doing to manage that, is part of what makes humans so amazing. By reaching that depth we are able to look at others and see the strong ones that have mastered the emotional world - not by ignoring it or pretending it doesn't exist. But by learning to ride it, to be able to embrace it without breaking under it. We are able to give greater support to those who are struggling. You will be able to see those who are terrified of the depths of emotion that are in all of us.  Asking for your emotions to be respected isn't too much. It should be a bare minimum for relationships.  Emotions are physiological responses, physical experiences in your body. They aren't something to be judged. We don't choose the emotion we're having, it just happens.  When he denies your emotional experience, it must feel so invalidating.  Naming the emotion & the physical feeling that goes with it is your job. He cannot know if your body is having an emotional response. He also cannot know how severe it is. All he has is what you say about it. You deserve to be with someone who believes that you are the expert on your own body and your own experience."

Excessive thoughts about the abuse,event.dreams,triggers,dissociation,memory ect. You should do some homework on this subject fir your win peace if mind."
ptsd,2wi0dg,Keeweebear42,5,Sat Feb 21 21:31:23 2015 UTC,"I think if you have ptsd you know it, regardless of what a doctor or therapist tells you. I don't know your symptoms but ptsd isn't easy to ignore. For me it was the nightmares that really drove home my realization it was ptsd, sure I broke down every time I visited my abusive parents and had intrusive thoughts about the past, triggers, memories I couldn't deal with, but the nightmares were so vivid and real that I couldn't ignore them. Each person copes differently and I'm sure some people get different symptoms. But I believe only you know if it's ptsd, some people don't have as many triggers, some can hide it or avoid it most of the time. But in the end you know, it's like you are haunted by it, I don't know you or your symptoms but I think most people with ptsd can relate to this.   Someone is wrong, you know who, most likely the therapist or it could be the doctor. You need someone who can help you get better or work through whatever is going on with you. You need to be able to trust them and feel like they understand you, if you don't feel comfortable or like your therapist is going to believe you then it isn't going to work and you need to find a new therapist. Because denying and invalidating someone who came to you for help isn't help them. You don't need someone who's going to make you feel like your experiences weren't as bad as you think or that your feelings aren't real. You need someone who makes you feel safe, heard and understood. Because confronting your demons isn't some you can do with someone who you feel isn't on your side."

I let mine go because I was in denial about it (most days still am) and it has taken complete control of me and left me with nothing. It doesn't get better on its own.

It wasn't violent I had been drugged and j only remembered parts of it. A month later I'm still coming to terms with it, trying to not dwell on shit and my dog gets loose during a walk and gets ran over by a car in front of me. I was calm and collected the whole time, watched my dog die and carried him out of the street,  talked to the driver and then put the dead dog in my sister's car. That's when I started crying uncontrollably. My left hand shook for over a day. I had nightmares about people and dogs getting ran over. If I see a stray by the road my heart rate goes up like crazy. Sometimes I suddenly remember more clearly how my dog looked when he was dying and I cry even more even after 2 years. I tried to pretend I was fine because I thought it wasn't serious ptsd I could handle it. Then I had a college class where all our books described rape and violence. I started blanking out in class to avoid thinking. It became impossible for me to go a week without feeling crazy. It was at this point over a year later that I decided to try therapy. Just talking in depth about what my brain was doing to an expert really helped and I highly recommend it.

Witnessing accidents can cause PTSD. Seeing a loved one hurt can cause PTSD. And you went through both.   I have PTSD too. I have been talking to a therapist and it has really helped me. I was almost catatonic last year. Anyways, you don't need to go to therapy if the thought makes you anxious. Therapy is not necessary to recover.   The main thing my therapist tells me is to work on loving myself. It's very important to counter the negative thoughts. When your brain says anything negative about you, you stop and tell yourself that you have done the best you know how and that's good enough. You tell yourself that you are a good person. Counter the negativity.   Is there a particular time you feel bad? Try breaking the cycle. Take a bath. Drink a milk shake. Be easy on yourself.   You'll be ok. :)"

And when I think about the worst possible outcome with certain events, which is usually every event, I go outside for about ten minutes and breathe. What we are doing is called ""catastrophizing."" We turn something that is so innocent, such as driving, into a full-blown catastrophe, in our mind. To the other people in the other car, they have no clue about what is going on in our heads. And how can they? Let us confront this fear head on with logic. Let's imagine that the catastrophizing is legit, yeah? There is a group of people that are out to get me. (Paranoia) I walk to my vehicle at an undetermined time so that they will be caught off guard. But they are not. (Play into the fear) However, I do not notice. (They want to get me when I'm not ready, right?) So I get in and lock the doors. Now how would they get me? Maybe break the windows? That would cause a pretty big scene. Whatevs. So they're probably just waiting until I get to my destination. But I've been going above, at, and below the speed limit and have noticed different cars and no one tailing me. So I get to my destination, exit the vehicle and hurry inside. I made it and I am safe. How did that happen so easily? It's because no one was out to get me in the first place. All of that effort just to give myself a momentary peace in my mind. Let's imagine that you are in the shoes of this kidnapper. How would you pull this off and escape unscathed and unnoticed? It would have to be well planned. And what is the benefit of kidnapping an eighteen year old man? What are the rewards for such a crime? Imprisonment, for sure. But that is eventually. Money?  No way. Too much risk of being caught down the line. Sexually? Possibly, but an eighteen year old man is a tough match for anyone. In all, I don't think so. Is the fear of it happening still lurking in the shadows inside you? Try this quick-fix: feel the fear inside when you think of this scenario. Focus the fear center mass, where your heart is. Now think of it as a Google maps and zoom in on the fear. Drilling down to find the fear. Have you played command and conquer? If so, the have a thing called the fog of war. It is the unknown.

In the same breath, I hope you realize that this whole thing makes me feel less safe talking to you about my issues with it, so I may talk to someone else instead of you sometimes, too.  I'm fine with doing that to keep the peace, but it still sucks that I can't feel supported by you, so please keep it in the back of your head that this whole disagreement is not okay with me.  But I'm just freaking done actively defending myself from you.""  I know that relationships are supposed to be about talking with each other and supporting each other in everything, but in this situation, you have a serious mental health issue.

ptsd,2w6c23,tigalicious,3,Tue Feb 17 12:38:30 2015 UTC,"I also have PTSD from childhood sexual abuse and what was helpful for me and my partner was to both call the national sexual abuse hotline at 1-800-656-HOPE.  They were able to give my significant other information on what I was going through, how to be a better support to me, and information on support groups for him so he had a place to vent and meet others who were in the same situation.   Another thing that helped was having him come to some of my therapy appointments with me as a support. He was there when I confronted one of my abusers and he saw how that affected me. I know you mentioned you were no longer in therapy. I don't know your circumstances but also calling the sexual assault hotline will give you access to resources. In my state there is a trauma center that offers both group therapy, support groups, as well as individual counseling free of charge. That may be something that you want to look into depending on your circumstances.  You may want to look at the website www.rainn.org together and discuss some of the information on there. It will have information not only for you but for those trying to support you. Communicate the ways in which you need support and as /u/tigalicious said set boundaries if you need to of what you can and can not talk about.   Consider the option of couple's counseling. This is not only a traumatic experience for you but also an emotional one for your significant other. He may need some help dealing with the feelings that come up within him in the relationship. He wants to protect you, he wants to support you, and he wants you to have justice. It's a very helpless feeling when those things are not a possibility and it doesn't seem like he's taking that very well.   Consider getting the books The Courage To Heal by Ellen Bass and Laura Davis. It's geared towards women victims of childhood sexual abuse but applies to adult survivors as well as men. It has a lot of good information not only for you but for people trying to support a sex abuse survivor as well. It will give him some insight into what you're going through and why you don't feel ready in going to the police and will give you some resources to move forward with your healing process. The book The Body Keeps The Score by Bessel Van Der Kolk also helped my partner understand what it was like living with PTSD and how to help me manage it."
