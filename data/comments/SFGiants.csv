SFGiants,3e3297,PackidPlays,3,Tue Jul 21 16:06:04 2015 UTC,"While normally being insanely pessimistic, I can't help but have a totally childish and unfounded swell of hope that what if--FUCKING WHAT IF--surgery gives him back the torque he needs to own his fucking fastball again?  Just, whatever you're doing in your day right now and whatever worries you might have hanging on you, just allow yourself a second to think that. Now change your underwear and come back to reality."
SFGiants,3e3297,readwrite_blue,3,Tue Jul 21 23:05:11 2015 UTC,"Couple of thoughts on this...   Is the hip diagnosis actually the reason why Timmy has struggled recently? Will he get hip surgery? The Giants already have taken too many expensive and unproductive chances on Lincecum, is it worth it to take a chance on a post-operation Timmy? If he were to undergo hip surgery and make a comeback, would it be as a starter or a reliever? Heyman mentions Jason Isringhausen as somebody who underwent a similar operation and I believe he started his career as a starter and finished in the bullpen."
SFGiants,3e3297,Piranha_Terror,4,Tue Jul 21 19:52:12 2015 UTC,"Don't know.  FWIW, I was just reading through the comments on a Baggarly article and found a guy talking about a scout in 2012 who was concerned about Lincecum's hips.  Supposedly this was discussed in a Grant Brisbee piece at the time, but I'm not sure. For now it sounds like they're going to try and wait it out. I think that a lot of it depends on how he performs if he pitches again this season.  Earlier today I was reminded that Lincecum was consistently throwing low-90's in Spring Training and lost that velocity as the season wore on.  I believe it was Henry Schulman who speculated that the hip discomfort could have been the cause.  If he were to come back and be right around 91-92, it's worth a shot if he can be had for cheap. For now it sounds like he wants to avoid the surgery, so such a decision is probably still a long ways off."
SFGiants,3e3297,DefNotUnderrated,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:00:52 2015 UTC,I hope if nothing else the diagnosis gives Tim some peace of mind. It very easily could be the worst damn news in the world to hear if you're in his position considering the fact that he's evidently very likely going to need surgery either now or a little further down the line. But on the flip side this may be preferable to not knowing what the hell is wrong with you or how to fix it. I hope he's experiencing more of the latter. Either way at least this was caught.

SFGiants,3e2lm6,dropperofpipebombs,7,Tue Jul 21 22:59:22 2015 UTC,"No, we need a 5 man rotation, but I think we need to rethink who belongs. I hate that we've moved Vogie to the pen. He's been the 3rd best starter for us this season. He didn't start out very well, but had a great May and an unlucky June while the whole team slumped. Bum and Heston have carried us, but Vogie picked up the slack as Timmy's start didn't last.  I get Hudson is old and not a guy we can throw out of the pen, but is he really going to give us better starts than Vogie for the rest of the season? I don't think so. He also still looks better than Cain has so far, and I hate having to say that!"
SFGiants,3e2lm6,ferfer1313,5,Tue Jul 21 17:46:39 2015 UTC,"The only issue is if Huddy doesn't start, he doesn't really do anything. A 40 year old starter isn't much of an asset in the pen."
SFGiants,3e2lm6,readwrite_blue,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:53:02 2015 UTC,"My guess is that if the team decides that Huddy can't start, we DFA him for a trade acquisition or move Vogey to his spot and DFA him for Affeldt when he's back. Or we send down Osich, which would suck because he's earned his spot more than Hudson has."
SFGiants,3e2lm6,alwaysreadthename,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:45:30 2015 UTC,"Hudson has done incredible things as a pitcher, and he got his ring last October. I think it might be time to bite the bullet and DFA him. My guess is Hudson knows it's a real possibility."
SFGiants,3e2lm6,Nonphoria,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:07:49 2015 UTC,"It may well be, but as we've seen with McGehee, it takes a lot for a FO to DFA someone they're paying a lot for. Huddy hasn't been a disaster, he's just been mostly bad. Vogey has been better, but he's also a better bullpen option (though not the best).  I fully agree Vogey should start over Hudson. I just don't know what it would take for Sabean to agree."
SFGiants,3e2lm6,readwrite_blue,2,Tue Jul 21 22:19:10 2015 UTC,"I thought McGhee was essentially a cheap place holder for Pablo?   That makes perfect sense though, obviously a lot goes into decisions to DFA someone, especially someone like Hudson who has really paid his dues ."
SFGiants,3e2lm6,Nonphoria,2,Tue Jul 21 22:28:42 2015 UTC,"He was, but he was substantially more expensive than Arias or Duffy. He represented an investment in 2015, and they really gave him a LONG leash. Longer than any armchair GMs wanted them to."

SFGiants,3e2lm6,readwrite_blue,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:37:11 2015 UTC,"I'm going to copy and paste what I wrote yesterday.  Baggarly hints in his write-up that the Giants' focuses could be changing for the deadline, saying that the straw may be about to break the camel's back in regards to starting pitching and centerfield. http://blogs.mercurynews.com/giants/2015/07/21/extra-baggs/ How much more can they take of an injured Pagan and terrible Hudson? While it is difficult to eat money, at some point a FO has to see its players' production and say, ""Enough is enough."" He states that prices fall and options expand as the deadline gets closer. That might be when the Giants try to make a move, possibly for a bigger piece as he lists the Reds, Phillies, and Tigers as potential options."
SFGiants,3e2lm6,PackidPlays,4,Tue Jul 21 22:26:48 2015 UTC,"I'm ready for a trade to fix up the rotation.  The more I think about it the more I believe Hudson vs. Vogelsong is splitting hairs.  I'm not particularly hopeful about Cain and Peavy, but one of them being good would be a giant help."
SFGiants,3e2lm6,PackidPlays,2,Tue Jul 21 19:12:25 2015 UTC,Cain and Peavy should be more than adequate for the 4 and 5 roles. I'd like to see a top three of Bum-???-Heston down the stretch.
SFGiants,3e2lm6,alwaysreadthename,2,Tue Jul 21 20:44:20 2015 UTC,"Like I said, if either Cain or Peavy turns out to be above-average this year AND the Giants acquire a top-of-the-rotation starter, you're looking at a fierce playoff rotation.  I can live with a sub-par #5 guy, but only if the team adds a second ace.    The offense has put the team in position to make the postseason this year.  Now the FO has to reward them by adding pitching."
SFGiants,3e2lm6,PackidPlays,3,Tue Jul 21 20:51:33 2015 UTC,"I feel like Vogey was moved to the pen because Vogey is better out of the pen than Hudson would be. We need vogey in the lineup, but Hudson in the pen may not be very good."
SFGiants,3e2lm6,MortalitySalient,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:05:32 2015 UTC,Exactly
SFGiants,3e2lm6,ferfer1313,6,Tue Jul 21 20:31:56 2015 UTC,"No, not if the Giants intend to make the postseason this year.  Giving fewer starts to Bum and Heston is asking for trouble with the team's other options in the rotation.  Also, as /u/Duramax2003 pointed out, Bumgarner is as well-built as they come.  He's not a 5'11"" 175 lb. guy who's going to tire and break down quickly.  The guy's a freaking bull."
SFGiants,3e2lm6,PackidPlays,4,Tue Jul 21 16:36:21 2015 UTC,"The Giants don't have to go with a strict 5-man rotation, nor do they have to use a strict 6-man rotation. Just see how each day goes."

SFGiants,3e2hhy,alchemistjuice_,12,Tue Jul 21 13:23:09 2015 UTC,I can't say I'd be interested in either. Price would cost too much and we have enough outfielders.

SFGiants,3e2hhy,Michael_Scott_Paper,9,Tue Jul 21 15:57:46 2015 UTC,"Lincecum, Hudson, Affeldt, Scutaro. We've got the money to sign Price."
SFGiants,3e2hhy,PackidPlays,7,Tue Jul 21 16:05:07 2015 UTC,"Even if the Giants had no impending FA's next year they'd still have the money to sign Price to a long-term deal.  Baer and Co. are making absurd amounts of money at AT&T.  Forbes currently lists them as the 14th most valuable sports franchise in the world and values them at $2 billion.  It's not my money, but I think if ownership really wanted to, they could spend like the Dodgers."
SFGiants,3e2hhy,TheMunch8,4,Tue Jul 21 16:16:38 2015 UTC,This 535 post does a pretty good analysis on each team's payroll vs win history: http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-your-favorite-baseball-team-blows-its-money/  The history of the Giants show that the team is more successful in the regular season when the front office does not over spend.
SFGiants,3e2hhy,PackidPlays,7,Tue Jul 21 16:42:02 2015 UTC,"To me, this just says that the Giants are smarter with their money than most teams.  Correlation ‚â† causation - the reason for the Giants' winning was not their refusal to give up gargantuan amounts of cash.  It just so happens that the FO is wise about where it places its $.  They can still be prudent with their choices if they start spending a little more freely.  Edited for clarity."
SFGiants,3e2hhy,TheMunch8,2,Tue Jul 21 16:48:19 2015 UTC,"The graphs also are since 1985 and Brian Sabean started in 1996, so that is a bit of a disclaimer.  Also, since Bobby Evans is taking a more prolific role in this type of work, we may see a little bit of a change in how the FO works.  Even though he has been for years, you never know.   If the giants were smarter with their money than most teams, I would think the graph would be all upward, similar to PHI or KCR.  I would think that this shows what we already know: The Giants are really good at finding and getting the best out of players that are not on blockbuster deals. I could be wrong but I don't think the Giants have had a great track record at getting the better end of mega-deals in the past 30 years. And, we are currently getting the best years out of the latest round of large/long deals (Cain, Posey, Pence)."
SFGiants,3e2hhy,PackidPlays,3,Tue Jul 21 17:01:15 2015 UTC,"The Giants are really good at finding and getting the best out of players that are not on blockbuster deals.   That's what I'm arguing.  They're finding fairly inexpensive, serviceable options as-is.  That's being smart with your funds.  As long as they don't go wild, the team could benefit from opening up the wallet a bit more while still being prudent in regards to which players they're getting.  I definitely would not say that we are currently getting the best years out of Cain."
SFGiants,3e2hhy,fullmaltalchemist,3,Tue Jul 21 17:15:04 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of other FA pitchers coming available over this off season. Cole Hamels, Doug Fister, Greinke, Kazmir, Ian Kennedy, John Lackey, Samardzija, Chris Young, and Zimmerman. Might be waiting and getting someone cheap."
SFGiants,3e2hhy,PackidPlays,2,Tue Jul 21 17:54:42 2015 UTC,"Hamels has two more years on his contract. But you're right in that the pitching pool is going to be really deep this offseason. If we don't sign Price, there will still be good pitchers available."
SFGiants,3e2hhy,readwrite_blue,4,Tue Jul 21 18:07:21 2015 UTC,The problem is that the Giants can win the division and compete in the postseason this year.  One of those pitchers mentioned should be here by 4:00 PM EST on the 31st.  The team has put itself in position for another run and it doesn't do the Giants much good if they wait until the Winter Meetings to make a move.
SFGiants,3e2hhy,PackidPlays,2,Tue Jul 21 18:19:39 2015 UTC,Totally with you there. I'm just agreeing with the general point he was making. I'm completely on the trade for David Price train.
SFGiants,3e2hhy,gothicel,3,Tue Jul 21 18:23:12 2015 UTC,"The high price of Price is in prospects and assets, not dollars."
SFGiants,3e2hhy,PackidPlays,2,Tue Jul 21 19:40:13 2015 UTC,"The cost would no doubt be significant, but don't forget that it would only be for a half season.  That greatly helps in making a potential trade more reasonable."
SFGiants,3e2hhy,PackidPlays,2,Tue Jul 21 19:44:04 2015 UTC,It all depends on how many and which prospects the Tigers want. They may not be as reasonable (to us) as we might hope for.
SFGiants,3e2hhy,EmilioTextevez,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:48:14 2015 UTC,"Honestly I don't value prospects very much.  The odds of one becoming an actual MLB contributor are next to none.  Remember when people were concerned because the Giants gave up Hembree in the Peavy deal last July?  Look how that turned out.  In short, the Tigers would have to ask for a ton of prospects before I turned them down."
SFGiants,3e2hhy,PackidPlays,5,Tue Jul 21 20:54:53 2015 UTC,"No need for a corner outfielder, the Giants could use a CF for Pagan.  I don't see any way Cespedes slots in.  I am interested in Price.  If he and Cueto have roughly the same cost, go for it.  The Giants need another top-of-the-rotation guy and he would definitely be the best pitcher on the market.  Hopefully it wouldn't mean having to dismantle too much of the ML roster to get him.  There are just too many times where a SP on the Giants only goes 5 or 6 innings, resulting in overuse of the bullpen.  Price gives you an almost guaranteed 7+ innings every single time."
SFGiants,3e2hhy,EmilioTextevez,4,Tue Jul 21 15:57:29 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I've got a major hard on for Price and have been advocating signing him since the offseason. I'd love to trade for him and then resign him. Hopefully he'd like it in SF. We'd almost certainly have to give up at least Beede for him, but I'm fine with that.  And yeah, we have no use or anywhere to put Cespedes."
SFGiants,3e2hhy,PackidPlays,2,Tue Jul 21 16:04:20 2015 UTC,"All things being equal I'd take Cespedes over Maxwell.  But that's not a big enough need to trade away anything for him.  I'd really hate to give away Beede for a couple months of Price.  I'd rather go out and get someone like Leake, then spend money on a big name starter in the offseason.  I think one of the reasons that Giants didn't spend big on a starter last offseason is because they knew the class this year would be significantly better.  I'd be very surprised if they sold the farm for a rental this year."
SFGiants,3e2hhy,EmilioTextevez,3,Tue Jul 21 20:19:25 2015 UTC,"My wishful thinking is that we trade for Price, which could very well push us into the playoffs. Hopefully he'll like it in SF, pitching for a good team in a pitcher's park with money, and we'll be able to resign him."
SFGiants,3e2hhy,PackidPlays,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:46:45 2015 UTC,"The Giants did try to spend big on a starter last year with both Shields and Lester.  The thing is, though, that I don't think the FO honestly expected to be in this position, but here we are.  The opportunity's in front of the Giants again.  I don't understand the logic in keeping Beede around for a chance at making the playoffs in the future when the team is in that position right now.  Besides that, the odds of Tyler Beede ever making an impact at the ML level are not very good.  He'll probably never do anything significant himself, but he could be used as a piece to get a proven MLB starter like Price.  If the return is right I would sell him off.  Then again, I'll probably never be a GM, lol."
SFGiants,3e2hhy,ericrs22,2,Tue Jul 21 21:09:15 2015 UTC,"The Giants did try to spend big on a starter last year with both Shields and Lester.   Shields ended up settling for far less than was expected.  We could have had him if we really wanted to.  Lester we were definitely in on, but that contract is starting to look bad already.    I'm not a huge fan of handing out $150MM+ contracts on 30 year old starters.  That's why I'm not big on trading away Beede.  I disagree that it's unlikely he makes an impact at the Major League level.  He's the top starter in the organization, and we've got a great track record and developing young arms.  We're going to have some big needs in the next couple of years in terms of the rotation.  I don't think filling multiple holes with 30 year old highly paid starters is the way to go."
SFGiants,3e2hhy,PackidPlays,3,Tue Jul 21 21:20:20 2015 UTC,"Actually Shields turned us down because when we made our offer, he was still in a 5/$125m mindset. When he turned down our 4/$80m, we turned around and resigned Peavy. He signed with the Pads after he realized no one was going to give him what he wanted."
SFGiants,3e2hhy,uuhson,2,Tue Jul 21 21:54:55 2015 UTC,"I guess we're just going to have to disagree.  The whole goal every season is to win a WS.  The team has put itself in position to do so (again).  For me, this is all-in time.  Price gives us the best chance this year and could put the Giants over the top.  There's an obvious need for a player like him.  I agree with you that you can't just hand out mega deals willy-nilly, but acquiring a true star every once in awhile is not a bad thing if it can get you another title."
SFGiants,3e2hhy,ericrs22,2,Tue Jul 21 21:33:40 2015 UTC,"I'd be pumped if we were able to pull it off, no doubt.  I just hope that if they make the move and have to give up Beede that A. they are prepared to offer Price the ~$200M that he's going to require to resign and B. they don't use that as an excuse to not go out of pursue other big name FAs.  There will potentially be some big time holes in the rotation in the next two years."
SFGiants,3e2hhy,PackidPlays,2,Tue Jul 21 21:58:54 2015 UTC,"OK, I agree with that.  I hope they would only trade Beede if they're prepared to retain Price.  Our FO is smart, so I think that would be the case."
SFGiants,3e2hhy,gibsonlespaul,2,Tue Jul 21 22:02:50 2015 UTC,"Who in your mind is the long term LF on the team?  Aoki is turning 34 in January and will start to dip off here next year or the year after.   Blanco is not an everyday player. Very good bench and role player but not everyday.  Maxwell is servicable but he's not the long term answer for 162 games as he's either feast or famine hitter.  Parker, Williamson and Lollis we still don't know a lot about to say anything.  Carbonell is still very Raw and until Carbonell starts to heat up, currently hitting .192 for the year .146 in AA, I think the needs of Corner Outfielder are still there. (more likely a CFer)  Cespedes is in his prime and with ties to the Bay Area already he could WANT to actually play here."
SFGiants,3e2hhy,PackidPlays,4,Tue Jul 21 17:56:15 2015 UTC,"The Giants do not have a long-term LF option.  I'd be 100% fine with Cespedes signing here in the off-season.  The fact of the matter, though, is that Aoki's having himself a fine season and is not a back-up at this point.  If you want to make that change next year when Maxwell's gone, that's fine.  In fact, I'd be all for it.  I do not know how Aoki's option for next season is structured, but he could be gone too.  If Cespedes were a CF, I'd love to have him in SF by the 31st.  It's painfully obvious that Pagan's hurt."

The guys in the front office are professional baseball executives - they've all been around the game a long time and know how the market works.  I seriously doubt they're all gun-shy over a single trade gone awry.  Remember that this is also the first trade deadline under Bobby Evans.  We don't know how aggressive or patient he is yet."

SFGiants,3dziu2,adm_hou,36,Tue Jul 21 19:33:34 2015 UTC,"Summary:  After taking a few steps toward the dugout after a mound visit, Mattingly turns back and exchanges a few more words with the pitcher.  Bochy argues this is two mound visits, the umpires agree, and the pitcher is forced to leave the game."
SFGiants,3dziu2,mitchsn,7,Mon Jul 20 22:24:40 2015 UTC,Mattingly stepped off the mound and was on the grass then turned around stepped back on the mound if I remember correctly. That wasn't shown in the replay.
SFGiants,3dziu2,GothicToast,2,Tue Jul 21 05:11:38 2015 UTC,He walks a good 5-10ft away from the mound and then turn around and walks back to the mound.
SFGiants,3dziu2,theredhombre,2,Tue Jul 21 06:20:57 2015 UTC,No he doesn't. He is literally 6 inches onto the grass. It's definitely 2 visits. But it's not 5-10 feet.
SFGiants,3dziu2,GothicToast,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:20:57 2015 UTC,"I may have used the term ""mound"" incorrectly, or you are just being a pedant, but he clearly turns around and takes 3 whole steps back to the dugout before turning around.

SFGiants,3dziu2,theredhombre,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:38:48 2015 UTC,It's all good. I'd consider the mound to be the entire dirt circle. He gets onto the grass. Just barley. That's what I would consider as leaving the mound.

Eureka is over 280 miles north of S.F. and has many Giants fans.  Eureka has been hit really hard over the last few decades due to the loss of the fishing and lumber industry.  For many residents of Eureka, the Giants are the only thing they really have to get excited about.  To mislabel a rural Northern CA city as being full of ""meth heads"" is wrong.  If you want to go after CA cities, stick to L.A. where Dodgers fans live.  Layoff cities like Eureka that is hotbed for Giants fans."
SFGiants,3dyps3,Humboldt79,25,Mon Jul 20 23:55:47 2015 UTC,"He was so ""FREAK""ish that indeed, he couldn't maintain that forever. But his delivery and his style made him so strange to hitters that it took more than 2 years to figure him out (Back to Back Cy Youngs will tell you that).   Mainly, the velocity dipped considerably, the splits became scary scud dirt balls from hell that were freaking Posey out and made Sanchez wish he had a big wingspan to go catch these balls coming from Timmy.   The no-hitters of recent years shows that he can still take control of a game if he's got it going on. But the main problem I've seen with his recent starts is that he can't get into a good pitcher's rhythm. You can tell with Bumgarner's demeanor is that he has a game plan and sticks to it with his face of stern concentration. With Timmy, it seems that he'll get frustrated if a pitch doesn't work or that he will throw ""the pitch he homers on all the time"" to someone like Paul Goldschmidt who owns him even though he thinks he could sneak it by him.   There are changes he's making and it is showing in glimpses, but he's got maybe a couple years left as a guy being #4 or #5 and can be a great bullpen weapon in the playoffs (2012 the legendary Tiger slayer).   I miss ""Big Time Timmy Jim"" but we won't ever get to see that again, but we will see a great pitcher with some scary stuff that has won our hearts and made great memories for us. He did win Cy Youngs and pitched wonderfully in a World Series to bring the trophy to SF for the first time in a long time, and for that, I'm eternally grateful. Thank you Tim Lincecum."
SFGiants,3dyps3,Salamanderfs,11,Mon Jul 20 17:31:18 2015 UTC,"Lincecum has always had one big problem: his mechanics are very complicated and hard to execute consistently. When he loses his mechanics, which he's always done sometimes throughout his whole career, he can't hit his spots and his curveball loses break. At the beginning of his career, he threw 95 and had a ridiculously amazing splitter (which is likely the pitch you're referring to from the Russell Martin at-bat), so he just threw his stuff down the middle of the plate and people couldn't hit it. He's older now, he's lost velocity, and when he loses that control his fastball either misses the plate or is 89 mph down the middle. You've probably heard pitchers say that as they get older, they need to ""learn to pitch"". Well, Tim Lincecum really can't do that because his mechanics are just too inconsistent for him to be able to have good control."

SFGiants,3dyps3,everythingisopposite,6,Mon Jul 20 17:41:47 2015 UTC,"I read one article which I now cannot find that discussed that as Lincecum's velocity gradually dropped and hitters started figuring him out, he kept adding pitches. In 2010, when he had a really bad month, the recovered in part by introducing his slider.  The idea is that the decline in his dominance was pretty steady but he kept bailing himself out by incorporating new pitches. In 2012, it started falling apart because his fastball velocity had just dipped too low to make his other pitches viable.  Throughout 2012, he was making tweaks to his delivery in hopes of finding more speed in his fastball. There was one start that year against the Dodgers were he had his 94mph fastball for about 4 innings and it was magic - he was his old self. But constant tweaks to his windup took a toll and his control started slipping.  This year he started out accepting his low velocity and succeeded by hitting his spots with a repeatable delivery. Now he's started to lose that too. Not sure what their plan is with him now."
SFGiants,3dyps3,readwrite_blue,4,Mon Jul 20 18:24:10 2015 UTC,"God I remember that Dodger game. Kruk kept saying stuff like ""he's back!"", ""he found it again"" and ""it's like he just got a new toy!""... And then it all went to shit."

SFGiants,3dyps3,readwrite_blue,4,Mon Jul 20 23:01:31 2015 UTC,"Are you talking about 2012 and on, or just from the middle of this season? I'm sure someone here will have a much more elaborate answer, but it's definitely a combination of changing mechanics and losing velocity. His curve actually broke and he hit his locations at the start of this season, but then things reverted to old ways quickly. He became way to unreliable to have as a starter. Especially hard to justify putting in the rotation as his toughest inning is the first one, and you never know if he's gonna come out of it and deal for the rest of the game or implode."
SFGiants,3dyps3,leadhase,4,Mon Jul 20 17:06:36 2015 UTC,"Personally I believe that it has a small part of having to pitch to Hector Sanchez behind the plate. Without a doubt mechanics plays a major role in his drop in velocity, but the wildness definitely has to do with confidence. For the better parts of his careers he's had strong game presence behind the plate with Molina and Posey, but after his breakdown in 2012, he got put at the end of the rotation (usually Posey's days off) and has to pitch to Sanchez.  As much as its has to do with mechanics, I think part of his mental game is shot."
SFGiants,3dyps3,fi233i3ii2d,4,Mon Jul 20 19:38:15 2015 UTC,"Its kind of the opposite.  Tim was really close with Molina and never really gained the same chemistry with Posey.  They decided to have him try pitching to Sanchez since he was doing terribly and it was a last ditch effort to see if a change of scenery would help.  It looked like it did for a few starts, but ultimately not much different.    Also, Lincecum throws all kind of weird stuff that moves funny, ends up in the dirt, etc so his catcher always gets pretty beat up.  Its not worth risking Posey's health over a back of the rotation pitcher."
SFGiants,3dyps3,giantsgeek,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:43:29 2015 UTC,"Maybe just personal dislike of Sanchez is affecting my call on that, but I just can't help but feel its was more downhill with Sanchez. Watching highlights, there seems to have been better moments while Posey was behind the plate."
SFGiants,3dyps3,fi233i3ii2d,3,Tue Jul 21 15:44:06 2015 UTC,"The decline of Tim Lincecum has been oft-talked about, never quite understood, and occasionally over-exaggerated. With the exception of a few outings, he's pitched well enough to keep a starting spot - the problem is we don't have 7-man rotations in baseball. It's a tough call - Hudson was the only surefire benching when Peavy and Cain came back, and look! He's back in the rotation already.  But yeah, the freakiness we saw in his Cy Young years is definitely gone."
SFGiants,3dyps3,p-wing,3,Mon Jul 20 17:50:28 2015 UTC,"His control was never the best, in fact it might never have been much better than it is right now, but when you can blow hitters away with 95+ and then come back with an 85 split/change and a devastating curve and slider, you don't need to have great control all the time. When the velocity went down to 88-92, there just wasn't enough speed difference for him, and his control might have worsened slightly, since he needed to pinpoint things slightly more. The loss in velocity made him have to do something he never had to in the past: actually know where the ball was going to go. Couple that with a mechanical imbalance (go watch 2010 NLDS game 1 and tell me that looks the same as the last few years, he literally falls off the side of the mound now, where he used to just plant his foot), and you have a pitcher who just can't be what he used to be."
SFGiants,3dyps3,scottydg,3,Mon Jul 20 18:08:52 2015 UTC,Best answer. Tim never had great control and now he doesn't have 95+ to get away with it. I miss how happy Timmy day used to be - he was The Franchise when Bonds left!
SFGiants,3dyps3,zizzurp,3,Mon Jul 20 21:17:12 2015 UTC,"Hey there Dodgerbro... you could've just asked me.  (i'm kind of a Tim expert). There are really 2 reasons. A lot of what ppl here are saying is correct, mechanics changed...the real question is why did his mechanics change...  As someone that watches him closely... it's weight.  In the last year before his decline, 2011, he put on quite a bit of weight for his small frame(~25lbs). At the heavier weight, he didn't have to rely so heavily on the technique he was using before.(being stronger, he could use more muscle)  That offseason, he dropped the weight plus some (~35lbs) and was still ""throwing"" like he still had the weight. that problem persisted until recently. By recently, I mean this year. Sure there were glimpses of his former self from 2012 until now (2 no hitters, and a beast out of the pen), which bring me to the other reason... mentality.  In interviews, he's said it himself, he comes out of the pen relaxed. In 2013(?), he'd have 3-4 shut out innings and the give up the farm in the 4th or 5th. Which, PGI after PGI, he said he lost confidence after he gave up that HR, hit, or walk. After the ASG that same year (i really think it was 2013), he started to pitch with a little more confidence. He attributed it to Chad Gaudin teaching him how to study hitters. So again, we caught that glimpse of his dominance.  So even though he got his confidence back, his mechanics were still not there.. for what? like 2 years until he went back and started working with his dad again... THIS YEAR.  Having gone away from his old style for so long his twisting muscles (obliques, rotary torso muscles) just lost the fast twitch ability they had in 2008-2011, which is why his velocity hasn't returned. He was great at the beginning of this season, and I think after this injury he cold be coming back to decent success again. Not amazing like before but decent.   Hope this answer your question!"
SFGiants,3dyps3,CynCity323,5,Tue Jul 21 02:17:30 2015 UTC,"Honestly, Timmy is a thrower. He never learned to pitch at this level. He got by on that beautiful fastball and when that went he had to scramble to find another pitch. Love you Tim-ay but this is the truth."
SFGiants,3dyps3,dodgerh8ter,2,Mon Jul 20 18:21:51 2015 UTC,"It's way more simple than the rest of this thread thinks it is. He's a small guy who is getting older. Small guys can throw mid 90's when they are in their early or mid 20's, but tend to lose velocity as they get older. When his velocity dropped, it made what was once a dominating change-up (15 mph slower than his heat) in to a VERY hot table pitch (5-10 mph slower than his heat). So what's left is his splitter, which is still a great pitch, but just doesn't have the control of his other pitches. He can't escape bases loaded, full count jams with his splitter for that reason. The bottom line isn't mechanics at all, it's that he's lost his bread and butter pitches."
SFGiants,3dyps3,feedthekitty,2,Mon Jul 20 21:05:51 2015 UTC,"You can see his changing delivery over the years. It's very apparent. His mechanics led to him consistently missing location - which is way more of a factor than simply losing his bread and butter pitches. He couldn't hit his spots with any pitches really. He went through stretches of a few games being totally on, then a some completely off, then back on. This is symptomatic of inconsistent mechanics."
SFGiants,3dyps3,leadhase,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:18:43 2015 UTC,"A lot of pitchers change their delivery slightly throughout their career. His walk rates don't indicate a huge loss of control. If you take away any pitcher's top 2 pitches, they will be much worse. It's just a fact."
SFGiants,3dyps3,feedthekitty,2,Mon Jul 20 22:25:53 2015 UTC,"""Andrew Baggarly ‚Äè@extrabaggs: Lincecum saw specialist in Tennessee about his hips. Had cortisone shot on both sides. Exam found ""degenerative stuff,"" Bochy said.""  Sounds like hes had a long term issue with his hips."
SFGiants,3dyps3,TwerkmansComp,2,Tue Jul 21 00:53:48 2015 UTC,"I mean, the obvious answer is ""his mechanics are off"" but that doesn't really answer the question of why.  He's not particularly old, and hasn't thrown a staggering number of innings/pitches.   My unsubstantiated theory, with no evidence to support it, is pretty simple: wear and tear on his slight frame have made it such that throwing the pitches consistently with the right level of ""bite"" on the breaking balls, and zip on the fastball causes him a lot of pain, so he had to accommodate by completely changing his throwing style to something that just isn't as effective."
SFGiants,3dyps3,Super_Natant,4,Tue Jul 21 00:55:11 2015 UTC,"He was an ace, better than Kershaw at the time. But his velocity dropped one season and he lost control, he hasn't been the same ever since."
SFGiants,3dyps3,duvangrgataonea,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:50:31 2015 UTC,"Instead of responding with tired platitudes about unrepeatable mechanics or a fragile body or too many bong rips to the dome, I just wanted to point out that everything changed around the time Bengie Molina left town.  Yes we have seen flashes of Big-Time Timmy Jim since, and no correlation does not imply causality, but I think that relationship is completely overlooked. Without a doubt, Posey is an upgrade over Molina in every way possible, but it's hard to deny he and Lincecum have had their differences."

Not all of them make sense (the ""science"" was done by TicketCity.com) but it's always good to see the Giants near the top of any list. Red Sox come in at #1, but he does have this to say about the Giants:  ""GIANTS AT NO. 2? To be honest, I thought they might be No. 1. As of the All-Star break, they'd sold out 374 regular-season games in a row, dating all the way back to 2010.

It will be higher quality and all that, and it's really not that hard to combine them. I do either a ""sync clap"", a high peak, easily identifiable sound at the same time on every recording, or just have everyone start their recording at the same time, with a countdown. The first one is slightly more work, but yields slightly more reliable results, the second is just easy. It works pretty well."

SFGiants,3dxl7m,mobuckets,3,Tue Jul 21 04:49:34 2015 UTC,I wonder if Baer's making a mental note about the pitching.  Maybe this'll convince him that taking on Hamels's contract might not be such a bad idea.

SFGiants,3dxl7m,dropperofpipebombs,3,Tue Jul 21 04:35:49 2015 UTC,That . . . shouldn't have been a triple.
SFGiants,3dxl7m,Valrek_Machines,3,Tue Jul 21 04:35:38 2015 UTC,Is Pagan this sensitive where he can't play left when Blanco plays?

SFGiants,3dxl7m,stephcurrylightup,2,Tue Jul 21 04:33:21 2015 UTC,Makes more sense with a slow contact hitter. With Blanco not so much.
SFGiants,3dxl7m,obgynkenobi,2,Tue Jul 21 04:37:06 2015 UTC,That wasn't a hit and run though. Either way the speed of the batter is irrelevant.
SFGiants,3dxl7m,Ma-teo,2,Tue Jul 21 04:38:44 2015 UTC,"Good point, but even then it theoretically gets a runner in socring position instead of a runner at first"

SFGiants,3dxl7m,cannonballwound,3,Tue Jul 21 04:32:35 2015 UTC,Blanco has to take that... can't put Crawford in that situation
SFGiants,3dxl7m,stephcurrylightup,4,Tue Jul 21 04:30:02 2015 UTC,Or he has to make contact
SFGiants,3dxl7m,sonny_goliath,4,Tue Jul 21 04:31:47 2015 UTC,Or take the pitch and it's ball four

SFGiants,3dytlt,JarHed808,4,Mon Jul 20 18:35:59 2015 UTC,"I agree that I don't see us ending up with any of them, but I would prefer Cueto of the bunch. We have a crowded outfield with ? marks, but having another solid starter would be great. I like Chapman, but I see Strickland filling the closer role by next season."
SFGiants,3dytlt,tylo144,4,Mon Jul 20 18:12:42 2015 UTC,"Nah, we'll end up with a weird person that only half of us have heard of. He'll be a second half MVP and the Giants win it all again."
SFGiants,3dytlt,PackidPlays,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:57:48 2015 UTC,"This is the most realistic scenario.  We'll probably be underwhelmed at the deadline and overwhelmed in October, LOL."
SFGiants,3dytlt,dodgerh8ter,3,Tue Jul 21 01:55:22 2015 UTC,Hamels or Cueto. Chapman would be great but I'd have a hard time justifying trading for a closer. OF is fairly clogged up right now. I'd look for some cheap bench power that can be had on the cheap.
SFGiants,3dytlt,contextplz,2,Mon Jul 20 18:18:26 2015 UTC,"As much as I despise Cueto, probably the two starting pitchers.  Jay Bruce has too high of a flyball rate to waste in AT&T, and even if we assume Pagan will visit the DL, we have Blanco waiting and Nori about to return.  Belt has also been spending time in left to have both Susac and Posey in the lineup, so unless one of these three are to be a trade piece, I can't see the Giants pursuing another outfielder unless the deal is too good to miss (which it won't).  Chapman is in the last year of his contract, which might make him cheaper since the Reds would rather get a prospect or two compared to nothing if Chapman hits FA.  Wishful thinking, since he's so sought after.  4 of these 5 players are on 2 teams that are definitely looking to go into rebuilding mode, which means they'll be looking to stock up on prospects with names, which we don't have too many of; a product of the team's recent successes.  I highly doubt they want to move the young infield.  But to go back to your question.  With a starting rotation of old arms and ""injured"" players, another anchor would be nice.  Or Chapman closing out games.  But like you said, not going to happen."
SFGiants,3dytlt,PackidPlays,2,Mon Jul 20 18:30:25 2015 UTC,Pagan isn't 100%. He is having knee problems. I would like to get Gerardo Parra.
SFGiants,3dytlt,noobonics,3,Tue Jul 21 00:58:46 2015 UTC,I completely agree.  It's obvious the guy is hurt.  Parra's definitely an under-the-radar option who wouldn't cost the farm to get.
SFGiants,3dytlt,iGetBuckets3,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:46:01 2015 UTC,I don't understand why he's not playing left with Blanco in center.
SFGiants,3dytlt,PackidPlays,2,Tue Jul 21 08:23:18 2015 UTC,What I want to happen and what I think will happen are very different regarding our situation. I highly doubt we will land a top starter to add to the rotation. If we do add a starter it's going to be someone like Mike Leake although I doubt we add a starter because we already have 7 viable starters. I've heard Parra's name come up a lot and I think that would be a great move if we don't have to give up to much. Aoki and Pence are constants on the corners and Parra would give us some options if Pagan is injured or slumping. I also feel that the bullpen needs another solid piece. I would love to see Chapman in orange and black although I'm not sure how realistic that is. Whatever happens I'm sure Sabean and Evans will do some magic and everything will be okay.
SFGiants,3dytlt,alchemistjuice_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:20:06 2015 UTC,"I think you're using the term ""viable starters"" a little too loosely.  There could very well only be 2.  Too early to tell with Cain and Peavy, though I'm not particularly hopeful about the former.  Vogelsong and Hudson are simply just bad pitchers.  I do believe a big move would push the team from very good to excellent.  I am much more concerned about the rotation than the bullpen.  Hamels or Cueto makes the Giants division favorites, IMO.  That gives you three starters that you don't really want to see in the playoffs if you're the opposing team (Bum, Hamels/Cueto, and Heston).  If Cain or Peavy can even be decent then SF looks really solid in the playoffs.  Shields or Hamels might not cost us the future if the Giants would be willing to take on a significant portion of their contracts.  There's 0 doubt in my mind they can afford it - they're printing money at AT&T.  The Giants are close to being (or already are) the best offensive team in the NL, and that's without much production from Pagan.  If you want to add a solid bat (Parra, for example) then that's icing on the cake, but pitching is needed more urgently."
SFGiants,3dytlt,PackidPlays,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:41:42 2015 UTC,"Like everyone else said, no outfielders. There isn't any room for Bruce or Upton since they can't play CF. I'd love for us to get Cueto or Hamels, but who knows if we have the pieces to get either. Hamels would also fill our rotation for next year (Bum, Hamels, Cain, Peavy, Heston) and leave only one spot for his contract year. Cueto would allow us to compete now and use our dough to get Price, resign Cueto, or another top line pitcher in the offseason.  I think our main concern is our relief staff. I'd love to get Chapman, but he would cost AT&T Park to get. We should look at others like Papelbon and others I can't think of right now."
SFGiants,3dytlt,alchemistjuice_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:39:33 2015 UTC,"I think your stance on the rotation is very reasonable.  People are scared to give up Beede and I just don't get it.  The odds of any prospect turning into a solid MLB pitcher just are not very good.  We are not talking about Matt Harvey or Noah Syndergaard here - Beede's a name that's really only well-known among Giants fans.  If the FO could get proven MLB talent for him, I would make that trade in a heart beat.  Also, don't give up on Price being unavailable at the deadline.  The Tigers are really riding the struggle bus, and he'd be a better option than Cueto.    I don't think that the bullpen is that bad.  Strickland and Lopez have been superb, and Osich looks like he could be something.  Kontos has pitched well, although there's been some serious luck involved there.  Regardless, the first three could make for a fearsome back end.  Chapman, IMO, would be overkill.  What do you think about Gerardo Parra, who is a GG outfielder?  He's under-the-radar but he would be a very capable replacement for Pagan if he's really hurt badly."
SFGiants,3dytlt,gibsonlespaul,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:53:02 2015 UTC,"Regarding Price, looks like you're right! Let's get him! http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2015/07/20/detroit-tigers-trade-deadline-sellers-david-price-yoenis-cespedes/30442019/  Regarding Parra, I don't know what the Brew crew are looking for for him. Depending on how injured Pagan is, he might be worth a look."
SFGiants,3dytlt,justin_tino,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:22:19 2015 UTC,"We definitely have the ability to nap a CF on the market like Gerrardo Parra, or if we're feeling bullish Carlos Gomez, and use Pagan/Blanco as super subs. Pagan is really hurting us out in center over there.  That being said, I'd love to see one of the young bullpen arms in the minors brought up (Law/Hall?) similiar to how Osich and Strickland are up, and a trade for Price would just make my day."

SFGiants,3dvtny,sfatoo,19,Sun Jul 19 23:21:42 2015 UTC,They have a .617 winning percentage in games following a win.  They have a .418 winning percentage in games following a loss.

SFGiants,3dvtny,justin_tino,2,Mon Jul 20 03:01:50 2015 UTC,"Interesting. And to have more fun with it, you could factor the difference from their overall win % (.533).

SFGiants,3dvtny,sfatoo,2,Mon Jul 20 05:08:46 2015 UTC,looks like we are setting up a monte carlo sim
SFGiants,3dvtny,rvncto,0,Mon Jul 20 06:34:44 2015 UTC,"That's perfect, thanks.  I was just thinking this morning how to frame that question.    Bigger question: is that normal or abnormal to baseball?  For example, if you looked at a huge sample of teams that played .500 baseball over a full season, would you see any difference in their winning percentage before and after a loss or would they be at .500 in both scenarios?  My impression of listening to stat geeks (and I'm not one) is that streakiness is almost always attributed to luck, the RNG playing games with you.  That there is no such thing as a hot or cold streak, and that baseball game wins & losses have no more memory of yesterday's result than a coin toss.  Is that really true?  If you flipped a coin 162 times, would that give you similar streakiness to what you would see if you looked at a bunch of actual seasons of teams that played .500 ball?"
SFGiants,3dvtny,ryeoldfashioned,5,Mon Jul 20 16:58:23 2015 UTC,"I'm sure there is, but one easy thing to look up is that we have the best streak in the majors right now.  Feels good."
SFGiants,3dvtny,combuchan,5,Sun Jul 19 23:43:30 2015 UTC,Probably count the number of times that we go from W to L or L to W. Lower numbers equal higher streakiness.
SFGiants,3dvtny,CheesingmyBrainsOut,9,Mon Jul 20 03:07:13 2015 UTC,I just looked at the numbers for the NL West:  SF Giants -- 35 Changes from W to L and 8 streaks of 5+ wins or losses  Rockies -- 39 and 3  Padres -- 44 and 1  D-Backs -- 46 and 2  Dodgers -- 52 and 2
SFGiants,3dvtny,es080994,3,Mon Jul 20 04:10:09 2015 UTC,Nice!
SFGiants,3dvtny,sfatoo,3,Mon Jul 20 05:10:29 2015 UTC,I'd say this is a pretty good way of calculating streakiness.
SFGiants,3dvtny,es080994,5,Mon Jul 20 03:44:03 2015 UTC,"I've been thinking about trying to calculate it. Here's how I'd do it: create a counter for every possible streak, from W20 to L20. For every game assign the win or loss of that game to the streak going into it. Convert those wins and losses in a percentage and you have the streakiness of the team. Perhaps compare that spread for the Giants this year against all teams over a long time span.  Or, you could do the same thing with the record over their last 10 games, from 10 wins to no wins."
SFGiants,3dvtny,jungrothmorton,2,Mon Jul 20 00:17:07 2015 UTC,Just came across this: http://www.fangraphs.com/community/streakiness/     A loss is defined as -1 and a second loss in a row would then become -2 and so on until the team won which would then be given a value of 1 with additional wins adding on top of that until a loss occurred.  If you then just look at the standard deviations of each team by this measure it should be easy to see who has been the most streaky.

SFGiants,3dsxbx,NorwegianTrees,7,Sun Jul 19 04:23:05 2015 UTC,Barely gets used. I'm sure he's had the same one since joining the Giants.
SFGiants,3dsxbx,Some_Annoying_Prick,5,Sun Jul 19 04:26:14 2015 UTC,Probably not his. He probably doesn't even have one.

SFGiants,3dtqa1,Gemsnake,2,Sun Jul 19 23:16:00 2015 UTC,I would bring in Osich.  It is a mistake to leave Casilla in.
SFGiants,3dtqa1,PackidPlays,2,Sun Jul 19 23:15:49 2015 UTC,Well it worked out.
SFGiants,3dtqa1,cannonballwound,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:16:23 2015 UTC,"It did, but Bochy did not give himself the best possible odds of success there.  Casilla stuggles terribly against lefties."

SFGiants,3dtqa1,Gemsnake,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:13:46 2015 UTC,Bum has to start pitching deep into games on a more consistent basis.  You need more innings from your ace.
SFGiants,3dtqa1,PackidPlays,2,Sun Jul 19 23:13:01 2015 UTC,"6.2 innings per start, average? DFA him already."
SFGiants,3dtqa1,falloutranger,0,Sun Jul 19 23:15:35 2015 UTC,"That is good, no doubt.  There are just too many games where his pitch count is at 100 after 5 or 6 innings."

SFGiants,3dtqa1,iProcreate,2,Sun Jul 19 23:02:21 2015 UTC,It's after the All-Star Break in 2015 and Hunter Strickland is healthy and has not allowed a home run in the majors or minors.
SFGiants,3dtqa1,superplatypus57,2,Sun Jul 19 23:01:35 2015 UTC,He's also averaging 11.5 K/9 with just under 2 BB/9.  I think he's the answer in the bullpen.
SFGiants,3dtqa1,PackidPlays,3,Sun Jul 19 23:04:16 2015 UTC,Propaint always makes me clench

SFGiants,3dtqa1,superplatypus57,2,Sun Jul 19 22:58:22 2015 UTC,"So, what's the general consensus on this Osich cat?"
SFGiants,3dtqa1,sackofblood,2,Sun Jul 19 22:57:24 2015 UTC,He looks great after he gave baseball one more shot after years of injuries. I'm rooting for him.
SFGiants,3dtqa1,superplatypus57,2,Sun Jul 19 22:59:29 2015 UTC,He looks pretty damn good so far.

SFGiants,3dtqa1,stephcurrylightup,2,Sun Jul 19 22:58:11 2015 UTC,Man Bochy is managing this series like the playoffs

SFGiants,3dtqa1,UnkleRuckus420,4,Sun Jul 19 22:44:58 2015 UTC,He wasn't sharp and the heart of the order was coming up. Seemed like Bochy wanted to play it safe and give Bum a little more rest.
SFGiants,3dtqa1,cannonballwound,2,Sun Jul 19 22:46:07 2015 UTC,"The announcers were also saying that with him pitching in the All-Star game, his rest in-between starts was a little skewed. Though we all know how Bumgarner can perform under short rest."
SFGiants,3dtqa1,giantstime123,0,Sun Jul 19 22:52:50 2015 UTC,"That may have been a factor as well, but I figure the bigger thing was Bum's pitch count + lack of sharpness + Goldy."
SFGiants,3dtqa1,cannonballwound,2,Sun Jul 19 22:54:34 2015 UTC,Good point. Rest up for the next start probably against the A's!

SFGiants,3dtqa1,lankyskanky,2,Sun Jul 19 22:06:52 2015 UTC,"Exactly, he'd do incredibly well over 6 or 7 innings and his pitch count would get in the 90's or low 100's. Next inning, trots back out and he would give up a run or two and what was a great outing turns into average or a little below."

SFGiants,3dtqa1,BombsInTheBay,2,Sun Jul 19 21:43:51 2015 UTC,Why wouldn't the DBacks challenge that? You can't be too afraid to lose that challenge
SFGiants,3dtqa1,stephcurrylightup,2,Sun Jul 19 21:40:37 2015 UTC,"They probably didn't think it was worth losing the chance to challenge later in the game in a more crucial situation, especially since it's only a one run game."

SFGiants,3dtqa1,alwaysreadthename,2,Sun Jul 19 21:40:27 2015 UTC,Typical Crawford play.
SFGiants,3dtqa1,giantstime123,3,Sun Jul 19 21:40:25 2015 UTC,Haha Bum gives the ump the evil eyes and then gets a strike even further off the plate the next pitch.

SFGiants,3dtqa1,lankyskanky,2,Sun Jul 19 21:35:51 2015 UTC,They're also close to the top of the NL in SLG
SFGiants,3dtqa1,alwaysreadthename,2,Sun Jul 19 21:37:35 2015 UTC,I can't imagine playing Baseball in 108 degree temp.
SFGiants,3dtqa1,BombsInTheBay,3,Sun Jul 19 21:29:02 2015 UTC,It sucks.
SFGiants,3dtqa1,falloutranger,2,Sun Jul 19 21:30:30 2015 UTC,You've done it? It seems like it would especially suck standing around waiting.

SFGiants,3dtqa1,alwaysreadthename,3,Sun Jul 19 21:22:52 2015 UTC,AT&T'd them right back
SFGiants,3dtqa1,anatabolica,2,Sun Jul 19 21:22:06 2015 UTC,Throwing like you don't have an elbow.

SFGiants,3dtqa1,alwaysreadthename,3,Sun Jul 19 21:24:18 2015 UTC,I thought the break would make him sharp... It hasn't.
SFGiants,3dtqa1,lankyskanky,3,Sun Jul 19 21:36:30 2015 UTC,"Goldschmidt, I don't like you very much. Not at all."
SFGiants,3dtqa1,_wynaut,3,Sun Jul 19 21:20:28 2015 UTC,Bum has nothing to put someone away with today.
SFGiants,3dtqa1,lankyskanky,2,Sun Jul 19 21:20:04 2015 UTC,"Is it me or are the Dbacks one legitimate ace (Kersh, Greinke, Bumgarner, Scherzer) away from making a run at another World Series?"
SFGiants,3dtqa1,Bluehale,2,Sun Jul 19 21:18:07 2015 UTC,"The rest of their rotation to me is kinda shaky, and they have a lot of inexperienced players on the roster. But they've been around the .500 mark this year, which I think is kinda impressive."
SFGiants,3dtqa1,giantstime123,2,Sun Jul 19 21:33:46 2015 UTC,The lineup is legit
SFGiants,3dtqa1,alwaysreadthename,2,Sun Jul 19 21:25:04 2015 UTC,1-2-3 inning please Bum.

SFGiants,3dv3my,MistaPickle,2,Sun Jul 19 19:37:05 2015 UTC,I have one I was considering selling. What size are you?
SFGiants,3dv3my,Tb1Anarchy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:40:52 2015 UTC,That would be awesome... I'm somewhere in the grey area of Medium and Large. Either would do the job.
SFGiants,3dv3my,Tb1Anarchy,2,Sun Jul 19 19:51:40 2015 UTC,It's an XL. I'm a Large and it fits pretty big on me. I can post some pictures of it if you're interested.
SFGiants,3dv3my,Hill-Arious,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:01:06 2015 UTC,"Hmmm. XL sounds a little big for my liking, thanks for the offer though!"
SFGiants,3dv3my,Hill-Arious,2,Tue Jul 21 02:28:34 2015 UTC,If you want a current Giants jersey with Bonds' name on it you could always do a custom jersey and just have his name and number put on it. I did that with a Lincecum how jersey because I wanted his name on the back and it worked perfectly
SFGiants,3dv3my,_saysar,2,Sun Jul 19 20:02:51 2015 UTC,"I actually tried that already, but they restrict you from using past player names and numbers...which seems kind of questionable considering they do not offer a distinct Bonds option"
SFGiants,3dv3my,Hill-Arious,2,Sun Jul 19 20:24:19 2015 UTC,I was able to go onto the customizer and type in B Bonds with number 25 and it let me start the process. That might be a good way around it
SFGiants,3dv3my,es080994,2,Sun Jul 19 21:00:09 2015 UTC,When did you try? Because I know back then they wouldn't even allow to do his #. But Barry Bonds now allows his # to be on jerseys. I'm sure his name is the same play. Try heading into a store or calling and asking.  I believe this is only with SF Giants Dugout stores not through the MLB Store
SFGiants,3dv3my,es080994,0,Mon Jul 20 03:38:34 2015 UTC,I was trying the MLB store. Checking with the dugout store sounds like a good idea though
SFGiants,3dv3my,Zealousy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:26:16 2015 UTC,"That is odd. Thanks for the info. I don't know of any other options off the top of my head. Hope you find what you are looking for. Of course you could always try to find a vintage one on ebay or something, but they wouldn't be the new jerseys"
SFGiants,3dv3my,dodgerh8ter,3,Sun Jul 19 20:54:44 2015 UTC,"I bought one from AliExpress and it was okay quality, but it was cheap. I can take pictures of it if you want."
SFGiants,3dv3my,ogfraizery,2,Sun Jul 19 20:22:33 2015 UTC,That would be much appreciated!
SFGiants,3dv3my,JL1823,2,Sun Jul 19 20:24:50 2015 UTC,"http://m.imgur.com/a/NcwN8 I know its not 100% legit, but its good enough for the $22 I paid for it. The only big issue I have is with how high the SF sits."
SFGiants,3dv3my,T-980,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:47:06 2015 UTC,Not too shabby...
SFGiants,3dub1o,man_tits,7,Sun Jul 19 15:27:34 2015 UTC,Usually takes a lot more games for catchers to he ready for the bigs.  Not like a normal position.
SFGiants,3dub1o,FTR,6,Sun Jul 19 15:37:09 2015 UTC,"The Giants would need to sign him to a ML contract which is, at minimum, more expensive than the minor league maximum.(?)"
SFGiants,3dub1o,TheWizirdsBaker,6,Sun Jul 19 16:56:11 2015 UTC,"Susac is only going to be out a week or two. Sanchez has experience catching almost every pitcher on the roster, and that will be his primary role while he is here."
SFGiants,3dub1o,ukez,2,Sun Jul 19 18:34:28 2015 UTC,Exactly. He's also a switch hitter which can come in handy off the bench.
SFGiants,3dub1o,Spooki,4,Sun Jul 19 19:19:36 2015 UTC,Trevor isn't on the 40 man. Hector is. They'd have to shuffle the roster.
SFGiants,3dub1o,EmilyamI,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:28:58 2015 UTC,Good point
SFGiants,3dub1o,dapper_dan,5,Sun Jul 19 22:02:47 2015 UTC,"Because we want him to get better and he won't do that being a spare catcher on a big league roster. Also, if Hector goes on a good run, someone else might want him. I'm sure that's what they're thinking."
SFGiants,3dub1o,readwrite_blue,3,Sun Jul 19 16:19:01 2015 UTC,Sanchez is hitting .190 in AAA this year and is coming off thE Concussion DL again.
SFGiants,3dub1o,dapper_dan,2,Sun Jul 19 18:17:29 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure it was phantom DL and not a real concussion.
SFGiants,3dub1o,EmilyamI,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:29:33 2015 UTC,"And yet, here he is"
SFGiants,3dub1o,FTR,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:56:05 2015 UTC,Keep your eye on Aramis Garcia. http://www.milb.com/player/index.jsp?player_id=605244#/career/R/hitting/2015/ALL  He's not getting the call any time soon but don't forget about him.
SFGiants,3dub1o,dodgerh8ter,-1,Mon Jul 20 18:25:47 2015 UTC,He will be Susac's backup soon.....
SFGiants,3dub1o,sfgiantsnation,5,Sun Jul 19 17:45:28 2015 UTC,"Yup, he will be Susac's backup. Meaning if anything happens to Susac he's first in line to be Posey's backup, seeing as that's Susac's job in the foreseeable future."
SFGiants,3dub1o,Buzzed27,3,Sun Jul 19 20:20:01 2015 UTC,"No, he won't."
SFGiants,3dub1o,FTR,-1,Sun Jul 19 19:56:39 2015 UTC,Yes he will
SFGiants,3dub1o,sfgiantsnation,3,Sun Jul 19 23:27:03 2015 UTC,"When is ""soon"" to you? Buster is going to keep being our main catcher for the foreseeable future."
SFGiants,3dub1o,alchemistjuice_,-1,Mon Jul 20 05:47:16 2015 UTC,"I think if Susac had not gotten hurt, he would have shared catching duties this season & full time catcher next year..."
SFGiants,3dub1o,sfgiantsnation,2,Mon Jul 20 06:34:08 2015 UTC,lol no
SFGiants,3dub1o,falloutranger,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:35:02 2015 UTC,It was just his/her opinion.  No need to be so dismissive.
SFGiants,3dub1o,RobinsonAnnulation,0,Mon Jul 20 15:40:12 2015 UTC,Because Sanchez deserves some time in the show for some of the concussions from lincecum
SFGiants,3dsh07,loseit_birds,52,Sun Jul 19 00:49:02 2015 UTC,Sue Burns was part of the ownership group that in the 90s helped keep the Giants in San Francisco and then build Pac Bell. She sat in that seat (home plate side of home dugout) for nearly every game until she was diagnosed with lung cancer and quickly succumb to the disease (fuck cancer). There is a plaque in the bricks to the left of the seat commemorating her.   Her obituary from the Chronicle.  Thanks for asking; more people should know about Sue Burns.
SFGiants,3dsh07,superplatypus57,6,Sun Jul 19 01:25:50 2015 UTC,(fuck cancer)
SFGiants,3dsh07,kasutori_Jack,3,Sun Jul 19 07:31:31 2015 UTC,That is my favorite type.
SFGiants,3dsh07,superplatypus57,4,Sun Jul 19 17:51:23 2015 UTC,Aw she died before she got to see them win a WS? That blows

SFGiants,3dsh07,almeida37,9,Sun Jul 19 00:52:12 2015 UTC,"I believe she passed during the week of the all-star game in 2009. I was at the first home game back, and we had an absolutely beautiful ceremony for her. It was incredibly touching."
SFGiants,3dsh07,deacDoc45,9,Sun Jul 19 02:07:44 2015 UTC,"I proposed in the scoreboard July 25 2009 at AT&T, there was an awesome ceremony before hand.  Barry Bonds was there.  Timmy pitched and struck out 15."
SFGiants,3dsh07,DogFacedKillah,2,Sun Jul 19 02:50:09 2015 UTC,"IIRC, her and Bonds were relatively close for people of those positions."
SFGiants,3dsh07,kasutori_Jack,4,Sun Jul 19 07:32:06 2015 UTC,"If there's one thing that the giants do incredibly well is honor people. I was at the tribute to Dave Dravecky, and I was too young to ever watch him (born in 88) but god damn it had me tearing up a bit. Idk how other teams do it but the giants certainly treat people who were involved with the team incredibly well."
SFGiants,3dsh07,kreynolds26,3,Sun Jul 19 03:54:33 2015 UTC,...unless your name is Barry Bonds.
SFGiants,3dsh07,time_to_despair,3,Sun Jul 19 07:28:43 2015 UTC,I thought about that actually...but now that the public steroid anger towards him is dying down they're slowly incorporating him back to the club. Bonds love is nearly 100% giants fans only so its hard to blame them for keeping their distance...he'll get his due I'm sure
SFGiants,3dsh07,kreynolds26,5,Sun Jul 19 08:03:18 2015 UTC,"Wow. Thanks to you both, I didn't know."

SFGiants,3dsy4s,alwaysreadthename,6,Sun Jul 19 04:38:51 2015 UTC,Be the sidebars you want to see in this world
SFGiants,3dsy4s,frakking-anustart,20,Sun Jul 19 04:59:28 2015 UTC,Just officially announced that Susac is going on the DL. Time to get reacquainted with Hector.
SFGiants,3dsy4s,hjb389,11,Sun Jul 19 04:08:06 2015 UTC,Fuck me
SFGiants,3dsy4s,sfgiantsnation,4,Sun Jul 19 04:22:24 2015 UTC,Oh no... whatever will we do with that old slouch Buster Posey as our catcher?
SFGiants,3dsy4s,time_to_despair,2,Sun Jul 19 07:23:34 2015 UTC,I'll bet they bench that streaky Belt & we get Arias at first....that's what!
SFGiants,3dsy4s,sfgiantsnation,4,Sun Jul 19 16:55:01 2015 UTC,How long is he supposed to be out?
SFGiants,3dsy4s,atb0rg,5,Sun Jul 19 05:30:33 2015 UTC,7 to 10 days. The 15 day DL will do him good.
SFGiants,3dsy4s,superplatypus57,5,Sun Jul 19 06:38:09 2015 UTC,Concussion. Whiteside?
SFGiants,3dsy4s,jesteronly,7,Sun Jul 19 04:26:59 2015 UTC,? Hector is on this way to Arizona right now.
SFGiants,3dsy4s,alwaysreadthename,5,Sun Jul 19 04:37:53 2015 UTC,"Whiteside is staff, not a player."
SFGiants,3dsy4s,Mattaholic,6,Sun Jul 19 05:22:18 2015 UTC,He went on the voluntary retirement list so they can reinstate (sign?) Him if they absolutely need someone.
SFGiants,3dsy4s,falloutranger,2,Sun Jul 19 06:17:33 2015 UTC,"I think technically the Braves own the rights to his playing contract right now. If he were to come back in to the league, the Giants would have to get him from the Braves. He was never officially released from them, he just retired early in the spring and went to the Giants coaching staff."
SFGiants,3dsy4s,scottydg,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:00:51 2015 UTC,"I really don't know how it works, but:   Bullpen catcher Eli Whiteside, who was on the voluntary retired list, is now eligible to be reinstated but it would require clearing someone else off the 40-man roster   That's all I can really find."
SFGiants,3dsy4s,falloutranger,2,Sun Jul 19 08:06:53 2015 UTC,Oh god no the week or so when Hector was on the team and not Susac was horrible
SFGiants,3dsy4s,stephcurrylightup,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:18:01 2015 UTC,I don't think Hector's had any playing time in the majors so far this season.
SFGiants,3dsy4s,spike021,2,Sun Jul 19 08:52:08 2015 UTC,He definitely has. Started the year in the majors with Susac in AAA
SFGiants,3dsy4s,stephcurrylightup,17,Sun Jul 19 08:55:18 2015 UTC,Belt has really been having a rough time.
SFGiants,3dsy4s,Mattaholic,6,Sun Jul 19 03:50:49 2015 UTC,Blet
SFGiants,3dsy4s,gbassman5,6,Sun Jul 19 03:51:44 2015 UTC,"You can tell he's really struggling mentally too, which had been a recurring problem. I just don't think he's tough enough to ever be a great 1B."
SFGiants,3dsy4s,twistedmind1586,3,Sun Jul 19 05:43:55 2015 UTC,His defense has been perfectly fine. Not sure why in this particular case his offense would have anything to do with his ability to be great at 1B.
SFGiants,3dsy4s,spike021,2,Sun Jul 19 08:53:09 2015 UTC,Wish we'd trade him while his value is decent

SFGiants,3dr1hr,man_tits,19,Sat Jul 18 17:02:53 2015 UTC,"How about don't make any huge trades this season? If we stay in the wildcard race, we'll have an exciting season and the team will make lots of money. We hardly need to go for broke to keep the fans interested or to keep the team relevant.  I don't care about Chapman. I don't care about Upton. I don't care about Cueto (in 2015). If we take a year or two to develop our pipeline, even at the expense of playoff runs, that will be okay. We have a strong team on the field and literally nothing left to prove. If you want to move on a FA in the offseason, fine. But now is absolutely the worst time to mortgage the future."
SFGiants,3dr1hr,readwrite_blue,12,Sat Jul 18 23:08:51 2015 UTC,"Trading Beede for the right guy isn't necessarily mortgaging the future. In 2009 the Giants traded Tim Alderson (who was the Giants top prospect behind Bum and Posey) and then won a world series the next season with what they got in return.   Then of course there is the much maligned Wheeler trade. That trade went about as bad as possible and yet the Giants have 2 championships since then and Wheeler still can't throw strikes and is currently having elbow surgery.   It all boils down to the popular scouting phrase ""There is no such thing as a pitching prospect""   TNSTAAPP, for short) is actually a shorthand way of expressing the idea that minor-league pitchers are an unpredictable, unreliable subset of baseball players. They're asked to perform an unnatural act--throw baseballs overhand--under great stress, thousands of times a year. They get hurt with stunning frequency, sometimes enough to cost them a career, more often just enough to hinder their effectiveness.    The Giants are a pitching first franchise when it comes to development and drafting. They use that skill to their advantage when it comes to trading. If they can develop a pitcher into something another team wants that can be just as valuable as developing him into a pitcher that can have a successful career with the Giants.   The Giants are going to continue to draft pitchers, they will continue to develop pitchers and they will continue to trade pitchers if the right offer comes by.   I'm not saying this because I'm eager for Beede to be traded, I'm actually not. I'm not even really disagreeing with you. I'd be completely fine with the Giants doing nothing as well.  I'm saying this because I trust the front office and turning Beede into a year and a half of Carlos Gomez would be pretty awesome."
SFGiants,3dr1hr,lankyskanky,6,Sun Jul 19 00:15:19 2015 UTC,If Beede fetches you a 3.5+ win pitcher it would be nearly insane to not trade him.

SFGiants,3dr1hr,diestache,2,Sun Jul 19 16:45:53 2015 UTC,"I disagree.  If you make all your moves with the future in mind then you hurt your chances to win now (an extreme example is what the Nationals did with Strasburg in 2012).  The window is open this year and the Giants have a very real chance to take the division.  The whole goal is to win a World Series.  When the opportunity is in front of you, why would you not pounce on it?  The FO can't just quit trying and say, ""Eh, whatever"" because of success in the past."
SFGiants,3dr1hr,PackidPlays,0,Sun Jul 19 06:11:31 2015 UTC,"My point is that ""win now"" mode can really harm a franchise and we should enjoy the lack of urgency to win now. Make smart moves, not disparate ones."

SFGiants,3dr1hr,JackMasterAndrew,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:12:27 2015 UTC,"The main reason Wheeler is injured is because the Mets had him.

I don't think the bullpen is as bad as some do - I'd say the Giants have the right pieces in the wrong spots.  Chapman, IMO, would be overkill.  I'm not too keen on the idea of trading him for a half-season of an elite starter, but another SP is necessary.  If that's the price to pay, I'd do it if I were without another option.

SFGiants,3dq6e6,gbassman5,5,Sun Jul 19 02:52:32 2015 UTC,"After looking good the first couple times out, both Cain and Peavy have put up sub-par starts."
SFGiants,3dq6e6,PackidPlays,4,Sun Jul 19 02:52:18 2015 UTC,"Peavy had two fantastic starts and this start was made worse because he was overextended and Pagan let a single turn into a triple. If he was taken out after the 6th like he should have been, 6 IP 3 ER (should've been 2) doesn't sound bad. I don't think Bochy will overextend him again, and Jake has been much better than Cain this season"
SFGiants,3dq6e6,stephcurrylightup,3,Sun Jul 19 02:50:54 2015 UTC,"Not really. Peavy did pretty well today, he just hit his usual 6/7th inning wall he ALWAYS hits. Bochy was trying to get max innings out of him cuz of last night"
SFGiants,3dq6e6,gbassman5,2,Sun Jul 19 02:55:14 2015 UTC,"IK, but it's a problem if he hits a wall in the 6th/7th inning.  He wasn't horrible, but I wouldn't exactly call it good.  His ERA for the game was 5.68."
SFGiants,3dq6e6,PackidPlays,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:53:33 2015 UTC,"Oh i agree. It's definitely a problem. Hopefully, the problem gets fixed at the trade deadline, or the Gian will need to shorten the bench and carry an extra reliever"

SFGiants,3dq6e6,gbassman5,3,Sun Jul 19 02:59:42 2015 UTC,"Our bullpen had to go a long time last night.  We had enough of a lead to risk Peavy staying in, but at the end of the day he couldn't last."

SFGiants,3dprnk,SargeantSandwich,19,Sat Jul 18 11:13:29 2015 UTC,"The Giants won a 5 hour game partly because Ryan Vogelsong bunted for a base hit  How can anyone (except for DBacks fans) not love the sport of baseball?  The good:  ‚Ä¢ The Giants won a game in which the starter performed very poorly.  ‚Ä¢¬†Joe Panik, Matt Duffy (11th inning AB not withstanding) and Hunter Pence all did huge things at the plate tonight  ‚Ä¢ Jean Machi almost definitely solidified himself as a DFA candidate  ‚Ä¢ The best: Other than Vogelsong, I don't think any of the relievers were used to the point where they couldn't pitch tomorrow. That's fantastic in a 12 inning game when the starter didn't do well  The bad:  ‚Ä¢ Machi proved he is awful once again  ‚Ä¢¬†Cain took way too long to settle in  ‚Ä¢¬†Maxwell, Blanco, and Belt were all mehhhhh at the plate  ‚Ä¢ Pagan is clearly playing hurt and it showed tonight. I'm not really reading much into how he's played as a result - he used to run out a lot of ground balls that he can't now, and would've made a few of his catches. If he continues to play this poorly after Aoki comes back and he likely goes to the DL, then we have an issue."
SFGiants,3dprnk,stephcurrylightup,10,Sat Jul 18 07:02:06 2015 UTC,Pagan man...I love the guy. But he is made of glass or something.
SFGiants,3dprnk,dabstract,5,Sat Jul 18 07:34:22 2015 UTC,Pagan is hurting but it's obviously not gravely serious. I think the team will be ok with Blanco at the bottom of the lineup for a couple of weeks in order to spell Pagan once Aoki returns.
SFGiants,3dprnk,alwaysreadthename,2,Sat Jul 18 08:26:45 2015 UTC,"This is what I'm hoping will happen, too.  Blanco can sub in every couple of games to give Pagan some rest, which he clearly needs.

SFGiants,3do8hq,Bk7,7,Sat Jul 18 07:10:32 2015 UTC,I don't really follow basketball but I think comparatively Bum's championship performance this year actually was better than LeBron's but the people who voted weren't really feeling that so LeBron won. The Espys are a meaningless award though so it doesn't really matter except that it's irritating
SFGiants,3do8hq,DefNotUnderrated,2,Sat Jul 18 02:56:09 2015 UTC,It was complete sarcasm. Lebron is an amazing athlete but his performance was based on the fact that many of the plays ran through him because the team didn't have many scoring options. With that said he wasn't able to do it by himself. Madbum as a pitcher had every defensive play go through him and he won. So I just think that automatically proves it was a better performance. Difference is lebrons complained about rest whereas madbum dgaf and wanted to go out there.

SFGiants,3do0p7,ruledcards,3,Fri Jul 17 21:08:12 2015 UTC,Yeah but they were able to buy 4 seats together. The other 3 of us has our own seats. It was a much more in demand game and they got 4 at the last second. I would bet you can get 7

From my experience, people are normally pretty nice about switching seats."

SFGiants,3dky3g,PackidPlays,22,Fri Jul 17 02:47:24 2015 UTC,I don't really understand Hudson over Vogelsong - Hudson's been pretty terrible this year and Vogey's been pitching some good ball lately.
SFGiants,3dky3g,alwaysreadthename,30,Fri Jul 17 02:48:15 2015 UTC,I think Bochy gives Hudson 1 or 2 more starts. If he sucks in those he'll be shut down for the season with a mysterious injury. #callingit
SFGiants,3dky3g,Haqt,5,Fri Jul 17 03:06:14 2015 UTC,"If they wanted to go the mysterious injury route, that would give them the option of trading someone to fill his spot and keeping Vogey in the pen.  It isn't so much that I want Vogelsong in the rotation, it's more that I'm worried about Hudson."
SFGiants,3dky3g,FTR,5,Fri Jul 17 04:55:29 2015 UTC,"I understand the logistics of Huddie's situation, but isn't this his last season? It'd be kinda sad to see him without a role in his goodbye year. I went to a game earlier this year versus the Angels and Hudson 2 hit them through 8.0 IP. I was happy that he would leave his career with a bang. Seeing as how this season has turned out, that's not the case, but it'd still be kinda sad to see him end his career with a ""mysterious injury"". Just my sentimental opinion, though.  Edit: I should say, though, I couldn't think of what to do with him. Could Hudson provide well from the bullpen? Vogelsong heading there, so not sure what role Hudson could play if he continues to falter in the SP role and cost us games."
SFGiants,3dky3g,stephcurrylightup,2,Fri Jul 17 06:26:26 2015 UTC,"You are right, it would be sad.  In all likelihood though, he's not going to be a good pitcher.  I'd much rather see him go out on a phantom injury than see him get lit up like a pinball machine every five days.  It's more graceful for him to fade into retirement than get embarrassed into it, IMO.  Ideally though he'd just pitch like he did the first half of last season and we'll never have to worry about it."
SFGiants,3dky3g,alwaysreadthename,2,Fri Jul 17 07:23:14 2015 UTC,He'll be on a short leash.  That's why Volgelsong will be in the pen.
SFGiants,3dky3g,Fluttertwi,2,Fri Jul 17 17:29:39 2015 UTC,I have a feeling his mysterious injury would end just about when September call ups happen
SFGiants,3dky3g,Blast-Off-Girl,3,Fri Jul 17 18:17:23 2015 UTC,I'm so down with adding another SP and keeping Vogelsong in the 'pen for long relief.
SFGiants,3dky3g,douchymcface,2,Fri Jul 17 04:58:34 2015 UTC,"This is where I'm at. I'm dubious about Hudson in the rotation, but finding it hard to complain about Vogey moving to the bullpen."
SFGiants,3dky3g,Super_Natant,4,Fri Jul 17 08:19:45 2015 UTC,Totally agree with you.  Hudson seems to get a lot of run support though.
SFGiants,3dky3g,zomgz0mbie,2,Fri Jul 17 04:33:24 2015 UTC,"Take advanced metrics however you want, but Vogelsong has pitched to a much higher xFIP this season (4.64) than Hudson's 3.86.  Vogey's walking almost 4 guys per 9 innings, has allowed far more hard contact and fly balls, and his numbers have been buoyed by a pretty unsustainably low BABIP (.263).   If I'm basing my rotation on predicting how everyone's going to perform going forward, rather than what their ERA/WHIP look like to date, I'd say Hudson's underlying skills indicate that he might be the better option going forward."
SFGiants,3dky3g,KNBeaArthur,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:04:23 2015 UTC,True but most of Vogey's bad starts were concentrated towards the beginning of the year.  He really kicked it up lately.  I think Huddy has been way more consistently not good.  I think he's just getting Huffed.
SFGiants,3dky3g,EarlChop,13,Fri Jul 17 17:44:55 2015 UTC,Vogey and Petit in the bullpen...that can be really useful.
SFGiants,3dky3g,zomgz0mbie,7,Fri Jul 17 03:45:40 2015 UTC,Angry gloves off.
SFGiants,3dky3g,falloutranger,5,Fri Jul 17 05:57:55 2015 UTC,"More info here  Man, reading that link, no spot for Timmy. Could he be traded? God it would be horrible to see him in another uni."
SFGiants,3dky3g,EarlChop,13,Fri Jul 17 03:28:01 2015 UTC,I would be okay with him in a Mariners uniform. End his career at home.
SFGiants,3dky3g,mtheory007,7,Fri Jul 17 03:46:09 2015 UTC,This is the only acceptable answer.
SFGiants,3dky3g,azureknightmare,6,Fri Jul 17 04:45:18 2015 UTC,"I seriously doubt anyone would want him.  He's having another bad season in the best pitcher's park in baseball and he's not exactly cheap this year...not too appetizing.  That being said, if some GM would get drunk out of his mind and offer something of value, I'd jump on it.  It would be really sad to see him go, but he's not really contributing this year."
SFGiants,3dky3g,atb0rg,5,Fri Jul 17 03:54:07 2015 UTC,"He wasn't contributing as a starter but he could be awesome out of the pen. Vogey is getting on in age. If Timmy could be relied up on as a long reliever I wonder if we'd trade Petit for a team looking to fill a gap in their rotation?  Edit : wasn't contributing, not was."
SFGiants,3dky3g,gothicel,7,Fri Jul 17 04:00:06 2015 UTC,"I think it's pretty optimistic to think he could suddenly be good out of the pen, but I guess you never know.  2012 obviously worked out well, but he wasn't so good last season in that situation and the team only trusted him to pitch once in the entire postseason."
SFGiants,3dky3g,dapper_dan,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:13:34 2015 UTC,Noooooo I love Petit
SFGiants,3dky3g,alchemistjuice_,3,Sat Jul 18 08:12:52 2015 UTC,"He's a Cy Young award winning pitcher. I wouldn't put it past at least one GM figuring that a change of scenery + different pitching coaches could help him find his groove. He may never get back to his former glory but if they could at least get a decent 3-ish ERA starter out of it, it'd be worth the risk."
SFGiants,3dky3g,falloutranger,3,Fri Jul 17 05:26:11 2015 UTC,"Maybe in the winter when he's a free agent and can be had for pretty cheap, but I just can't imagine anyone wanting to trade for him in his current state at his current cost."
SFGiants,3dky3g,Justingmiranda,5,Fri Jul 17 07:16:43 2015 UTC,Hudson is done! Vogey has been way better
SFGiants,3dky3g,readwrite_blue,6,Fri Jul 17 04:48:41 2015 UTC,"Well at least we have options so let's wait and see, also hope it works out for the team, not the individuals."
SFGiants,3dky3g,arcowhip,6,Fri Jul 17 05:38:57 2015 UTC,"Vogey works better as a starter, he needs a rhythm of pitching every few days. I'm sure his stars coming out of the pen are way worse than his starts. Problem with vogey is he is great for 80 pitches then blows it in the 6th. Why not have Hudson and vogey each pitch 4.5 innings for a game? I think that would be a cool way of doing it."
SFGiants,3dky3g,readwrite_blue,2,Fri Jul 17 05:45:33 2015 UTC,Creative idea. I like it. It works because both Hudson and Vogey tend to run out of steam come the sixth.
SFGiants,3dky3g,arcowhip,3,Fri Jul 17 15:36:33 2015 UTC,Basically picking up the rotation where it left off. Heston pitched last.
SFGiants,3dky3g,PandaLover42,3,Fri Jul 17 02:48:18 2015 UTC,I am very optimistic that with Cain and Peavy coming back strong and well rested we have another title run coming.
SFGiants,3dky3g,falloutranger,3,Fri Jul 17 14:02:23 2015 UTC,"I like Vogey, but Lincecum has proven to be a much more effective bullpen arm. When his ""injury"" runs its course, it might be the end of Vogelsong."
SFGiants,3dky3g,airwalker12,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:31:54 2015 UTC,Please someone correct me if I am wrong but I thought Timmy's bullpen stats were worse than his starting numbers?
SFGiants,3dky3g,alchemistjuice_,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:30:28 2015 UTC,"Really? That may be true. I guess I'm also just thinking of the few times we've tried to use Vogey in long relief, which were disasters iirc."

SFGiants,3dkk6f,kasutori_Jack,5,Fri Jul 17 00:49:50 2015 UTC,I think it was phantom DL rather than any real injury.
SFGiants,3dkk6f,readwrite_blue,2,Fri Jul 17 00:50:29 2015 UTC,Wait so he was bumped to make room on a AAA roster? That's a bad sign...
SFGiants,3dkk6f,readwrite_blue,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:38:43 2015 UTC,"Eh, we had three catchers on the roster at the time. They're developing Brown, and they've been playing Quiroz a lot lately.

Just too skilled at slapping the ball.  4) I watched Jackson pretty much his entire time in Detroit, right up until he was taken off the field in the Price trade.  Bad in the playoffs, trending downward.  Slowest ""fast"" guy I've ever seen.  Saw him dive to try to catch a ball exactly one time.  No thanks.  5) If this happens, the Giants are screwed.

SFGiants,3dgd3t,OpenMindedMajor,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:18:40 2015 UTC,"Because the NBA Championships happened a month ago where Bumgarner's performance happened 8 months ago. We all know Bum's performance was better, even /r/nba agrees almost consensusly that Bumgarner deserved it more.  That and the voting population is often casual, and remembers more recent acts, and the voting population is younger, and outside of the Giants, MLB does terrible with the <30 year old crowd."

SFGiants,3di5nv,FreakInThePen,11,Thu Jul 16 15:30:44 2015 UTC,"It was voted by ESPN fans. It was the more recent event. Lebron is a diva, so he gets more attention. His team sucks, so he carried them."

Do make every effort to get there.       Boys still suck   Yeah they can be like that.    Girls too.    People in general.    I still try to believe in the good in people despite many disappointments.    Adjust your expectations accordingly.  I need baseball!!   How 'bout you?

If you're serious about learning the language, I would highly recommend looking for an actual class you can go to on your free time. There's just some stuff you can't really pick up over an online course/self-teaching. However, if you don't have the time or you just want to learn it for fun, Lifeprint has a really good self-taught lesson plan. There are so many resources out there to help you get started, like this dictionary and this playlist of basic words/phrases. Tip: some signs, like words, are signed differently according to region. So if you signed the sign of ""Oakland"", someone from Minnesota probably won't understand what you're saying. Good luck and feel free to PM with any questions!"

SFGiants,3ddqhg,SpeaksForItself,3,Wed Jul 15 19:59:38 2015 UTC,Not a great clubhouse fit. He threw a fit when Torres passed him on the depth chart. Also the fact he couldn't stop pulling outside offspeed pitches to 3rd didn't help.

SFGiants,3dgo8v,FreakInThePen,5,Thu Jul 16 04:22:21 2015 UTC,"Really? If you look at Ott and McCovey's career stats, it's not particularly close, Ott was a far more historically great player. As an example, McCovey has 64.4 bWAR, Ott has a tremendous 107.8 bWAR."
SFGiants,3dgo8v,hjb389,2,Thu Jul 16 06:29:45 2015 UTC,Does bWAR take into account park effect?  I agree Ott was probably better but it doesn't seem like he should rate that much better and his HR stats were notoriously inflated by playing at the Polo Grounds.
SFGiants,3dgo8v,HarryBridges,3,Thu Jul 16 13:12:27 2015 UTC,"Absolutely it does. The Polo Grounds did inflate HR totals, but it depressed other types of hit. Ott's career away OPS was .918.   Ott is an inner-circle Hall of Famer, yet is all too often forgotten."
SFGiants,3dgo8v,Barry-Zito,2,Thu Jul 16 18:20:30 2015 UTC,"Exactly, we can examine Buster better when he's past his prime. Much too soon now. Interesting, Cain is in the pitcher's top ten WAR career list already. Bonds was such a baseball god."

It's great to see the numbers and see how amazing Ott or Mathewson (or Ruth or Cobb etc) were relative to their time in baseball, but when it comes to comparing giants from all time to each other, I just can't do it. I don't know how anyone can do it without studying their careers and the history of baseball like it's they have a midterm on it. Even the game of baseball has changed so much.  At least with Mays and McCovey, there's video, they're still alive, people today talk about seeing them play, and honestly they are talked about a lot more than Ott and Mathewson."
SFGiants,3dgo8v,PandaLover42,8,Thu Jul 16 19:19:04 2015 UTC,Well considering few if any alive today saw them play I'm not surprised
SFGiants,3dgo8v,malcontented,7,Thu Jul 16 04:06:03 2015 UTC,Yeah those were both very poor picks. But the current dynasty and naming a cove after a guy both go a long way for the casuals.
SFGiants,3dgo8v,alwaysreadthename,7,Thu Jul 16 04:22:49 2015 UTC,"I'd say keep Posey, as early as it seems. He's won 3 championships in his last 4 healthy years. Those World Series each saw a different ace and closer. He's been the rock of the Giants golden age. I think he deserves to be in the top 4 already."
SFGiants,3dgo8v,TheTranscendent1,4,Thu Jul 16 08:51:34 2015 UTC,"I feel the same. Posey was critical in helping us win our first title in SF. He didn't help us win just one or two, but three world series championships. He won the the NL Rookie of the year, MVP, a batting title, a few all star game selections, caught multiple no hitters and a perfect game, and has been the backbone of our team. He is the Giants for me right now"
SFGiants,3dgo8v,bodnast,-3,Thu Jul 16 12:10:04 2015 UTC,"You can't just list what Posey has accomplished over 4 1/2 seasons and act like it's on par with what Ott did over his entire Hall of Fame career. And for what it's worth, Ott played much better in the same number of World Series as Posey."
SFGiants,3dgo8v,A_few_prawns_short,3,Fri Jul 17 02:57:46 2015 UTC,It's hard to argue against 3 out of 4.  Have to go back to the Yankees in the mid 20th century to find someone who's done something like that.
SFGiants,3dgo8v,FTR,2,Thu Jul 16 19:53:56 2015 UTC,"Derek Jeter won four in his first five full seasons, and almost won five in six."

In the exact same number of series and games, Posey has hit just .230/.288/.328 with two home runs, while Ott hit .295/.377/.525 with four home runs, including a World Series winning home run in extra innings. And he obviously blows Posey out of the water in regular season performance.   As for the Giants golden age, maybe we're in the middle of what will turn out to be just that, but we're not there yet. For now, it's probably the '20s and '30s."

Posey as a current player and Bonds from the recent past probably got a lot of votes because voters have fond first-hand memories from watching them.  McCovey is at the park all the time and very involved with the organization not to mention having the cove named after him giving him a lot of recognition/familiarity with current fans.  Then then of course, Willy Mays is Will Mays.  No explanation needed.  Not that surprised those were the 4 to win a fan vote."
SFGiants,3dgo8v,giantsgeek,0,Thu Jul 16 22:17:58 2015 UTC,"They absolutely are. Buster is already a champion and the face of the team for his time. Buster was integral in bringing us 3 championships in 5 years, calling a perfect game, bringing an MVP to the bay, being the ROY, batting champ, silver slugger... I mean he's a cold blooded winner.   He's almost a victim of his own success in this way... I mean come on, he's just getting warmed up and he has what are the highlights of a first ballot HOF Catcher. He deserves as much as any other player to be on the ""Mount Rushmore"" of Giants, and by the end I think he will be the greatest.   One thing I know for sure is that after Posey, I will never look at the number 28 the same way again and I never want to see anyone wear it in black and orange if it was my choice.  I think Posey deserves the designation of a franchise four player as does Willie. The Giants have had a history of excellent players and some greats are bound to be left out."

But at this point, it's too early to judge. You cannot leave out two inner-circle hall of famers for Posey and McCovey, with Matthewson regularly called one of the best pitchers of ALL TIME and Ott one of the best first basemen of ALL TIME (statistically superior to McCovey, whom I also love, in almost every way)"

It's over, they guy has proven he is a sub-par big leaguer!   Yes, he strikes out a lot, but that doesn't make him a ""sub-par big leaguer"" and luckily there are more stats to check than just K% to figure that out. He's second on the team in wOBA and wRC+, behind Buster Posey (and tied with Joe Panik), and 5th in WAR.  He's 6th on Fangraphs's list of first baseman (7th on the actual list, but that's because it has Buster on there), but we should tooooootally trade him."

SFGiants,3divxc,lankyskanky,4,Thu Jul 16 20:11:48 2015 UTC,"Like lankystanky said, he's team controlled until 2018, so we don't have to pay him $12 million a year (yet). If the Giants are smart, they'll probably try to work out an extension that would take care of his remaining 2 arbitration years and see if he'll give them some of his FA years on top of it.  This is an article all about how much a win costs, and it's roughly $7 million. Belt's already at 2.4 WAR this season, so he's provided the Giants $16.8 million value for his $3.5 million salary."

I wonder what that forum thinks of players that are actually bad. Because Belt is nowhere close to bad.  .279/.352/.481 136 wRC+  There are only 4 players in all of baseball with more doubles than Belt.  Who the hell do people think we will get in a trade for him anyway? Some prospect that may turn into Belt. I just don't get it. He is stepping into the prime of his career and he is the best power threat on the team. Not to mention, we don't have another 1st baseman."

SFGiants,3divxc,SacTownSizzle,3,Thu Jul 16 20:06:52 2015 UTC,"I can agree with all of that. And I thought he should be starting from day one, but I'm a homer and a big fan of his (played little league for a few years with him), so I love having him as our backup C!"

Would not trade him for a pitcher.  BTW, Belt becomes a free agent after the 2017 season.  Not sure where people are getting that he's a FA after this year.  He is eligible for arbitration next season.  Also, he doesn't suck.  That's ridiculous, he's one of the top three offensive players on this team, maybe in the top two."

The only way the Giants could make that work is by moving a starter as well. Bum is untouchable, Cain is untouchable/too expensive for anybody to want to touch him, nobody wants peavy/Hudson/Vogelsong/lincecum, so that means petit goes or you have to get rid of Hesto. While having Hamels would do delicious things to our rotation, I think the Giants are a better team with belt if for no other reason than their depth."
SFGiants,3divxc,lt150,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:57:18 2015 UTC,I don't disagree I just think the option needs to remain open. Another possible 1B replacement in scenario number one is Adam Duvall. I'm not a Belt hater I'm just being realistic. He is our most valuable commodity at the moment.
SFGiants,3divxc,manicwizard,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:17:53 2015 UTC,"For enthusiasts of middling power with literally no other tools, Adam Duvall is a prime time guy. If you want to win baseball games, however, having somebody who can either hit or field or ideally both is pretty cool. Brandon Belt is a top ten first baseman in the NL, he still has years left on his contract, and given RAJ's ridiculousness, a Hamels-Belt trade would likely have to involve a Crick or Susac as well."

His worst was June when he had a 67 wRC+.   100 is league average so that should tell you that his hot streaks are way better for the team than his cold streaks are harmful.

If a good player/prospect was on the table for him than I would not hesitate to pull the trigger, I don't think he is anything more than a .270 18 HR 60 RBI type of guy."

SFGiants,3ddrbr,p-wing,4,Wed Jul 15 15:24:09 2015 UTC,"1962 - Home-field advantage, lost.  1989 - 4 games.  2002 - I wouldn't blame home-field advantage on that bullshit.  2010 - 5 games - more in Texas even though we had homefield.  2012 - 4 games.  2014 - Didn't fuckin' matter, did it?"
SFGiants,3ddrbr,MattSFChi,10,Wed Jul 15 19:07:50 2015 UTC,"I have been giving a lot of thought about the second half of the season. We need to win at least 70% of the games through 8/5. All of these teams are below .500. Then the schedule gets friggin brutal until mid September. Cardinals Twice, Cubs Twice, Pirates, Nationals, Astros and The Bums. It's a tough schedule, but here is why I am optomistic:  Pitching: Cain is looking back to form and so is Peavy. Huddy just turned 40, but with essentially 6 weeks of rest he will not have the slight collapse he had in the second half last year. Madbum.Our bullpen needed this rest and I think we will add another bullpen arm to solidify it.   Offense: We will be getting Aoki back which will be huge to have a legit lead-off guy back in the lineup. Pagan needed the rest, but in the series against the Phillies he seemed to be seeing the ball really well. With Aoki back we will be able to platoon Blanco and Maxwell and give Pagan, Aoki, or Pence days off as needed. Also our lineup will finally come together. My projected lineup: Aoki, Panik, Duffy, Posey, Pence, Belt, Pagan, Crawford, Pitcher. Susac will get more games at catcher to keep Buster's legs fresh. When Buster is at first we can do a lot with the linup and play matchups and who is hot.  Defense: I see no defensive slide with this team at all. In the late innings look for Blanco to replace Pagan in center and get the Michael Morse treatment especially at bigger parks. We have the best infield in baseball. Aoki's return will give us the speed and range we need in left to compensate for Angel losing a step. I love this team defensively.  We also have Bochy who can play baseball chess better than anyone else in the game. He will effectively manage the pitching staff, and lineups to give us the best chance to win.    We don't have to win pretty or put up gaudy numbers. We just need to get into the tournament. We all know what happens when we do that.  Go Giants! Let's get pumped."
SFGiants,3ddrbr,UnkleRuckus420,3,Wed Jul 15 17:03:26 2015 UTC,I am going to Vegas on 8/5.  This is enough for me to believe we can win 70% of the games by then.  Also depending on the lines I might as well throw some bucks down on the Giants to win it all.  I am livid I didn't toss down a hundo on them when I was in Vegas in October.  Ugh.
SFGiants,3ddrbr,MattSFChi,4,Wed Jul 15 20:31:39 2015 UTC,What were our odds to win it all in October of last year?
SFGiants,3ddrbr,UnkleRuckus420,3,Wed Jul 15 21:15:36 2015 UTC,ehh i don't remember.  I don't think I was sober for more than 15 minutes total on that trip.  Something like 5:1 tho I think.
SFGiants,3ddrbr,spike021,2,Wed Jul 15 21:50:09 2015 UTC,"Your words.. I like 'em. I've been thinking it for a while. With our team pulling together (getting Aoki back, Cain reverting back to form, etc.) we stand a real solid chance. We just need to sneak back in and we'll be set.  Plus I am loving that potential lineup. I think it works really well. When Aoki was still healthy, him and Panik being at the top were putting on a clinic. Couple that with Duffy staying consistent/getting hot yet again, plus Pence back and Posey there too things will be super smooth."

Military history is what I'm big into."
SFGiants,3ddrbr,MattSFChi,4,Wed Jul 15 17:18:29 2015 UTC,"Oh Hells to the Yeah! If you haven't yet read The Last Lion: Winston Spencer Churchill you better. It is a 3 book set which is absolutely Amazing. His life/policies/decisions and involvement at that time were the most influential of any one person during that time period.   Now if you want Action read Pegasus Bridge. It is about a british commando unit written by Ambrose and it is amazing. Detailed accounts, formations and strategies about how this group fought to prevent a Nazi counter attack against ALL odds. Thrilling Thrilling Stuff.   American Perspective: American Caesar-Douglas MacArthur. This dude, as you know is essentially the American Version, in my opinion, of Winston Churchill being that he also was involved in the conflicts that Winston but on the front lines and in different theatres. This is a wonderful read and really goes into detail about strategies his tiff with the American command structure and his overall BadAssery. Amazing book.  My Favorite biography of All Time: Theodore Rex  What I think is interesting is to get the American perspective about its place in global affairs before this period. There is one dude that made the United States what it is in the 20th Century. In my opinion Theodore Rex is the best biography I have ever read. Teddy Roosevelt was the man."
SFGiants,3ddrbr,AvastYeUpboat,6,Wed Jul 15 17:39:24 2015 UTC,"I'll put the Churchill biography trilogy on my wishlist. FDR has always been my man when it comes to leaders, but Churchill is pretty fascinating from what little I've learned of him.  I'll think about Ambrose's other works. I do have Band of Brothers (yet to read it, watched the miniseries a bunch), and the 101st Airborne and their involvement in the war is probably one of my favorite parts of history. However, I do know there are some issues with his reliance on primary sources and his idolization of soldiers.  I'll keep the MacArthur one in mind. Important military figure in the 20th Century.  I'm not a big Teddy Roosevelt guy, but he was definitely one of the better presidents. I just resent him for being a total warmonger when it came to Cuba."

It goes into the scientific, social, and political history of the atomic bomb. The writing is so good, too, really keeps you interested. I also want to read The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich by William Shirer. Both of these are pretty popular books, though, so you may have heard of/read them already.  I also listen to Dan Carlin's Hardcore History podcast. His episodes focus on an event and he tells the story in a narrative format, often focusing on the human perspective in vivid detail. Best podcast imo, and often more entertaining than watching a TV show. He's got about 15 recent episodes available for free, and like 40 archived episodes you can buy. He just finished up a series on WWI, too."
SFGiants,3ddrbr,AvastYeUpboat,3,Thu Jul 16 00:57:52 2015 UTC,I literally ordered The Rise and Fall and canceled it because I heard some bad things about it on /r/Askhistorians.

If they want to take a hard line then they have to kick out every player who ever took a ""greenie"" which is a PED.

Seriously if the HOF uses speculation & rumor as their standard for who gets in and who is banned then perhaps they are not the best group to vote on such things.

It's like comparing LSD to pot stems. ""They're both drugs!"" Well, yeah, but that overlooks how different they are and their difference to performance. Greenies also have a limiter, meaning a person can only take a certain amount for a certain amount of days before they become bad for your performance. (Strung out, wired out) The comparison sucks Alpaca balls."

SFGiants,3d9pf9,conro88,0,Wed Jul 15 10:14:06 2015 UTC,He's a fucking dirty player in a sport full of them he's nothing special. If he did everything without them I'd agree with you but the man's head grew 6 sizes and he hit better when he was about to retire that doesn't happen without hgh.
SFGiants,3d9pf9,KobraCola,2,Wed Jul 15 10:24:44 2015 UTC,"Of course he's something special. He's the only player ever with 400 career steals and 400 career home runs. Oh yeah, and he's the only player ever with 500 career steals and 500 career home runs. That's right, I forget that steroids hit literally 762 home runs. Barry didn't even do anything! That's why every player who took steroids hit 762 bombs, right? Oh wait... Yup, Barry took PED's. Hank Aaron and Willie Mays took greenies. Babe Ruth played against a small segment of the population that was only white people. Go to any era and you can find a way the best players cheated or a caveat to their performances. It's hilarious that people act like Bonds or players of his generation were the only ones to cheat. Nope, they were the only ones who got caught massively. I bet a ton of players take undetectable PED's to this day. If the MLB really wanted to catch them, then they'd use extremely stringent Olympic testing. But they don't because guess what? Better performing athletes are more fun to watch. The MLB, like every other professional sport, turns a blind eye for their bottom line. Barry Bonds is the best baseball player of all time. Deal with it."

SFGiants,3d9pf9,867-5309-,16,Wed Jul 15 14:22:33 2015 UTC,"I've always loved Barry, defended him endlessly and when I've met him he couldn't have been nicer.     It is absolutely wonderful that Barry is allowing the world a little peak into his life and they are getting to know the wonderful, friendly, passionate Barry Lamar Bonds that we Giants fans have been so lucky to know for years!    This photo is precious and Barry's Instagram never fails to bring a smile to my face (It's almost as good as Jon's but Mr Miller is still the Instagram champ).    Two of the greatest baseball players in history (arguably the two greatest) sharing a bed with each other...not scandalous, simply  family. :-)"

SFGiants,3d9pf9,MollHolland,7,Tue Jul 14 19:28:35 2015 UTC,The most important takeaway from this photo: Willie Mays sleeps with a gold chain around his neck.

SFGiants,3d9pf9,Rockstaru,5,Tue Jul 14 22:26:17 2015 UTC,I saw this photo and immediately started searching for the news story about Mays passing away.  Looks like Bonds is taking a selfie at an open casket viewing.
SFGiants,3d9pf9,facemelt,3,Wed Jul 15 00:29:18 2015 UTC,strange?  yes.  BB does have pretty good social media game otherwise.

SFGiants,3d9pf9,SaturdayCartoons,3,Wed Jul 15 03:24:54 2015 UTC,"Why is this creepy? Willie is like a father to Barry, especially after Bobby passed away. This seems genuinely heartfelt and really humanizes these two legends. I find it refreshing, not creepy."
SFGiants,3d9pf9,savardfaire,2,Wed Jul 15 06:34:17 2015 UTC,"'Cause Willie is conked out. If Say Hey was awake and smiling next to Barry, then yeah, real sweet picture."
SFGiants,3d9pf9,KobraCola,2,Wed Jul 15 10:05:27 2015 UTC,"It's just like a tad bit weird because he snuck up on Willie when Willie was sleeping to take a selfie with him. Plus the ""Yes he sleep ...and yes I sleep next to him"". The bad grammar combined with the sleeping together combined with the taking-a-grinning-selfie-when-Willie-is-asleep kind of makes it weird IMO."
SFGiants,3d9pf9,SaturdayCartoons,2,Wed Jul 15 10:07:54 2015 UTC,"Okay, I see it now. Lol"

SFGiants,3d91vw,BrianIsLost,2,Wed Jul 15 04:04:27 2015 UTC,"Berman at least ESPN has been smart enough to almost entirely divorce from baseball. Yes, he does the Home Run Derby and somehow manages to be incredibly annoying in a single annual event, but at least he doesn't consistently broadcast games. Kruk is awful, but he's like standard awful, I guess? Haha, I dunno, Reynolds just grinds every last gear I have. At least Morgan has retired from broadcasting. But Reynolds, every time I hear him (and we're forced to with like literally every national broadcast Fox does, including most postseason games), I'm just reminded by how much he loves speaking in cliches and broad terms that don't actually mean anything. He loves ""gritty"", ""vet"", ""just a good ball player"", and all those other complete bullshit phrases that pretend to say something without actually saying anything. Not to mention, he hates sabermetrics/advanced statistics and does everything he can to discredit them. Honestly, I hate him even more than Joe Buck, who is bland but not outwardly offensive, haha."

So many factors come into play as to whether or not a team can win (another) championship; such as whether key players can stay healthy, if players hitting/pitching well in the 1st half can keep it up in the 2nd half, if struggling players can rebound, and how hot the team is come September.  As we've seen in the past, it isn't always the most talented team who wins in October. Rather, it's the one who's the hottest; and one cannot simply predict that in July."

Before the seats sprawled away from the field as it got higher making you far and high.   It makes for a bit of a hike up the stairs but a way better view.
SFGiants,3d3eh5,Rdubya44,5,Tue Jul 14 04:53:11 2015 UTC,Those are honestly some of my favorite seats. Great to see balls and strikes. Well I cant afford club level behind the plate so these are fantastic.

SFGiants,3d1ga3,PackidPlays,14,Sun Jul 12 19:07:45 2015 UTC,Vogey to the bullpen with Machi getting kicked out?
SFGiants,3d1ga3,PandaLover42,6,Sun Jul 12 19:15:44 2015 UTC,"That's what I'd guess.  As badly as the Giants need bullpen help, I can't imagine they'd option Osich or Strickland when they're pitching well."
SFGiants,3d1ga3,SeanziHunterelli,4,Sun Jul 12 19:55:57 2015 UTC,"Machi's actually been doing decent since he last came up, with a  3.00 ERA.   My money would be on Petit. He's been struggling a bit, with a 5.0 ERA in June and a 9.00 ERA in July. With Vogey being a fifth starter caliber player, he'd take over the long reliever role."
SFGiants,3d1ga3,uprightbaseball,7,Sun Jul 12 20:55:03 2015 UTC,They're not gonna DFA their long man machis most likely to go
SFGiants,3d1ga3,uuhson,2,Sun Jul 12 21:38:35 2015 UTC,does petit have options? if not there's no way they'd dfa him
SFGiants,3d1ga3,SeanziHunterelli,4,Mon Jul 13 00:35:02 2015 UTC,"With Vogey in the bullpen, and probably Timmy when he gets back, Petit could become expendable. I do think Machi is a good target to get the DFA, but I wouldn't be surprised if it were Petit."
SFGiants,3d1ga3,PandaLover42,2,Mon Jul 13 00:05:38 2015 UTC,"That's a good point, I can see that happening."
SFGiants,3d1ga3,yohomatey,10,Sun Jul 12 21:26:04 2015 UTC,"Kinda crazy idea: Since both Vogelsong and Hudson seem to perform a lot better on longer rests, what if the Giants rotation had a dual 5th slot? Like every other 5th start it was Vogelsong and then the following was Hudson? They could still pitch a bit of relief if needed."
SFGiants,3d1ga3,SargeantSandwich,7,Sun Jul 12 21:33:45 2015 UTC,"It's definitely a creative idea, but I can't see it happening because then you're basically wasting a roster spot. If you move one guy to the bullpen, then both players are providing some value, but if they each only pitch every tenth spot, that's two guys who are combining to provide the value that one guy normally provides.   Edit: ""They could still pitch a bit of relief if needed"" whoops, didn't see that bit :) that's what I was thinking too. I think it could possibly work, but managing the workload of each guy could be complicated"

SFGiants,3d25as,Feverdog87,5,Sun Jul 12 23:15:35 2015 UTC,"All our outfielders were broken, Freddy Sanchez's shoulder meant second base was a revolving door of Keppinger, Tejada, Burris, Fontenot and whoever else I don't like to remember, shortstop didn't fair much better even though I have fond memories of Orlando Cabrera for some reason, #FreeBelt was fully upon us with Huff old-manning at bats all year, B Wheezy ignored a torn UCL the entire year before it finally tore in August, and Posey. Now that I think of it, for such a fun season, there was a lot that went horribly wrong.   So, by my memory, 2011 was not a healthy year, especially in the second half, actually. Good news is that this year the Giants are getting good performances for the most part from the replacement players and the team is trending healthier recently. We might actually have that full month of a healthy team once Aoki is back."

It would be cool if there was a better way to navigate players stats from within the app, especially in regards to sabremetrics. Getting to see pitch fx location and full play by play is pretty nice though."
SFGiants,3d15fr,leadhase,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:07:07 2015 UTC,"I got frustrated when the gameday portion became a pay service, but I guess it makes sense. I actually bought the premium mlb.tv monthly subscription and cancelled it after a couple months when I moved back to SF. I can still access everything except for the video which is pretty nice, not sure if that's a bug or it was always that way? Either way I do enjoy it still, but yeah I wish there were more stats and features. And the audio gets funky on me a lot and I have to refresh frequently."
SFGiants,3d15fr,Buzzed27,2,Mon Jul 13 01:50:30 2015 UTC,"Not sure about that being a bug or not. I definitely have my at bat subscription logged on multiple phones (mine, parent's, girlfriends) and they have all been able to access and use the features no issue. The audio definitely plays slightly behind radio or tv feed, but I've used it on the 300kbps download connection at my dad's house and had minimal problems.

SFGiants,3czuze,Bongdestiny,19,Sun Jul 12 07:50:06 2015 UTC,Id be surprised if they pick up a starting pitcher. It seems like the Giants are always hesitant to get more than one piece and never anything too big / costly. I would expect a utility outfielder with decent batting and a bullpen piece.   Then maybe a big starting pitcher in the offseason. Probably Grienke ;)
SFGiants,3czuze,piss_n_boots,7,Sun Jul 12 11:03:00 2015 UTC,"Well Beltran was a disaster, but Pence in 2012 and Peavy in 2014 were both critical pieces acquired at the deadline. Both of them played crucial goals in getting the Giants to the World Series in the respective years they joined the Giants."
SFGiants,3czuze,hjb389,15,Sun Jul 12 11:26:38 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say Beltran was a disaster. He played well when he was healthy, and people give Sabean shit for giving up Wheeler for him but Wheeler hasn't really done much since."
SFGiants,3czuze,downtothecellar,8,Sun Jul 12 15:07:44 2015 UTC,"The deal was a disaster. It was a shortsighted move to bolster a team that didn't have a playoff run in the tank. Can't blame Beltran though. He showed up as a pro.  I'd rather have Wheeler in the bank right now. He's been a solid, dirt cheap pitcher with a big upside.  Still, one move we don't like isn't so bad in our recent history."
SFGiants,3czuze,readwrite_blue,2,Sun Jul 12 17:26:44 2015 UTC,It was only a disaster because they made no attempt to resign Beltran. Drove me crazy.
SFGiants,3czuze,TittayMilk,2,Sun Jul 12 19:15:20 2015 UTC,Aging player who wanted multiple years. He did some good things for the Cards but I'm not too broken up that we let him walk.
SFGiants,3czuze,readwrite_blue,3,Sun Jul 12 20:55:19 2015 UTC,He signed a 2 year deal..
SFGiants,3czuze,TittayMilk,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:26:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he signed a 2 year deal for 30 million. Like I said, aging player wanted multiple years. He ended up doing good things for that price, sure. But I wasn't too broken up when we let him walk."
SFGiants,3czuze,readwrite_blue,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:16:02 2015 UTC,I know we both agree on Beltran because we've talked bout him a lot in the past but   didn't have a playoff run in the tank.   Seems like something you've decided is true after the fact.  We had a very strong shot at the playoffs.
SFGiants,3czuze,kasutori_Jack,2,Mon Jul 13 04:58:40 2015 UTC,"You're right, and I'm being very cynical looking back. Also using my position in the future to criticize the past. And both he and Keppinger really did their part as Giants.  And the front office was under crazy pressure to make a push, given that we were defending champs.  At the time, none of us expected the team to collapse in fatigue the way it did."
SFGiants,3czuze,readwrite_blue,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:14:12 2015 UTC,"The front office being under crazy pressure is often forgotten.  I mean, our first title in half a century?   You better believe that they were gonna go all out the next year."
SFGiants,3czuze,kasutori_Jack,4,Mon Jul 13 05:19:49 2015 UTC,"We got Peavy & Pence for peanuts, I don't think those count against what you responded to. They were the only big deadline deals those years, but they didn't cost us much."
SFGiants,3czuze,TheTranscendent1,5,Sun Jul 12 16:02:29 2015 UTC,Beltran raked while he was with us. It's not his nor sabeans fault the rest of the team unraveled after the trade was made.

SFGiants,3czuze,Feverdog87,-5,Sun Jul 12 17:03:13 2015 UTC,Are we going to be oversensitive about me suggesting he lay off the drugs? Because that was not even close to an 'insult.'
SFGiants,3czuze,BlackestNight21,10,Sun Jul 12 17:08:53 2015 UTC,"No man, its about not bringing toxic crap into a good subreddit. Save your frustration for the game and the FO.

All of these things are your projections.  If I had said, ""You're on drugs"" ""You're out to lunch"" or ""you're fucking crazy"" would you have still replied? To the first, maybe...to the second? Probably not. It's an archaic phrase but would the vulgarity of the third have tripped your sensitivity alarm?   There's no toxicity. There is no dirtying of the house with any of these comments. I suggest if you'd like to continue this discussion message me privately so as not to make the oversensitive more...sensitive."

SFGiants,3czuze,BlackestNight21,4,Sun Jul 12 17:41:44 2015 UTC,"Haha, my comment was entirely satirical. I figured that'd be obvious since it was in caps. Also, I'm not the original person you were talking to."
SFGiants,3czuze,FBoaz,9,Sun Jul 12 17:49:46 2015 UTC,Relief pitcher. I hate to say it but I don't think Machi will be a Giant by the end of the season.
SFGiants,3czuze,j__35co,2,Sun Jul 12 17:01:59 2015 UTC,I don't think he's gonna be a Giant when all our SPs are healthy.
SFGiants,3czuze,kasutori_Jack,5,Mon Jul 13 05:02:43 2015 UTC,"I'd like to see a utility player added to the lineup to increase our bench's effectiveness.  I don't really have patience for another aging pitcher unless we can snag someone amazing, but we now how much the Giants love stacking the deck with pitching.  We've got some ace SP prospects right now that I'd like to see called up when the roster expands, and I'd rather see them be given a try.  Young talent is definitely where we should be moving considering the current state of the MLB and our success with Panik, Duffy, Susac, Heston, and now Osich."
SFGiants,3czuze,itisisntit123,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:16:26 2015 UTC,"We've got some ace SP prospects right now   Where? In AAA we have Blach, Blackburn, and Stratton. The first two are back of the rotation types (which could be useful in our situation if they outperform Vogey, Peavey, Hudson, Lincecum, or (gasp) Cain. Stratton is the best of the bunch and most likely not ready yet, but he's close and will be with the team in September if he keeps it up in AAA!  In AA we have...

Need one guy to come off the bench and spot start at multiple positions to give our players some rest, like what Matt Duffy did at the beginning of the season. One strong power arm that is reliable and can back up Romo/Casilla."
SFGiants,3czuze,shake_n_bake,4,Sun Jul 12 15:33:15 2015 UTC,Was Morse still a consideration for us?
SFGiants,3czuze,sgtsheabo,2,Sun Jul 12 15:59:51 2015 UTC,Nah i think someone pointed out how unfeasible that was. Plus we would have no legit space for him besides power utility.
SFGiants,3czuze,Feverdog87,4,Sun Jul 12 17:53:01 2015 UTC,"Bum - Cain - Peavy - Heston - Vogey. Huddy and Tim in the back pocket. We have a rotation that can get us to the playoffs.  We have a solid lineup, especially if Aoki can come back healthy. If Affeldt can come back healthy, I like our bullpen.  For me, we need bench depth. I don't want to give away any future pieces to make a stretch run this year of all years. If we finish a couple games out of the WC, honestly, that's okay."
SFGiants,3czuze,readwrite_blue,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:23:45 2015 UTC,"Our bench is pretty good. Susac, Arias, Blanco, Maxwell. Who would your replace? Maybe go with one less RP?"
SFGiants,3czuze,PandaLover42,2,Sun Jul 12 17:37:15 2015 UTC,"Maxwell and Arias don't hit. I wouldn't mind replacing them, though it's nice Arias can play any infield spot."

SFGiants,3czuze,SergioSF,5,Sun Jul 12 20:34:35 2015 UTC,"He's definitely a better fielder than Arias at short and second, and Arias has been a truly, incredibly bad hitter this year."
SFGiants,3czuze,Fluttertwi,2,Sun Jul 12 20:39:18 2015 UTC,I would replace Maxwell before Arias.
SFGiants,3czuze,kasutori_Jack,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:04:56 2015 UTC,"I definitely would not, because at least Maxwell has played great defense."
SFGiants,3czuze,Fluttertwi,2,Mon Jul 13 05:12:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but we can find a defensive corner OFer pretty much anywhere.  It's a lot harder to find someone you can plug into the infield anywhere."
SFGiants,3czuze,kasutori_Jack,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:18:22 2015 UTC,"But we already have another one on the roster, who is better than Arias.   Edit: also, even cold post-April Maxwell is a WAY better hitter than Arias."

SFGiants,3czuze,PackidPlays,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:41:32 2015 UTC,"I disagree about the bullpen. I would really like to see the Giants go for a solid bullpen arm. Osich has done well so far, but rooks usually get figured out pretty quick. Hopefully thats not the case, but I'd still like a newer reliever."
SFGiants,3czuze,es080994,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:36:16 2015 UTC,"Kontos and Strickland have been solid. Lopez-Romo-Casilla-Affeldt are exceptional, some bumps aside. Petite is insanely valuable. Machi isn't great, but when we get Affeldt back we won't need to rely in him much."
SFGiants,3czuze,readwrite_blue,2,Sun Jul 12 19:12:35 2015 UTC,"Lopez, Kontos, and Strickland have been the most consistent throughout this season as a whole, with Lopez being absolutely lights out. Casilla and Machi have been extremely inconsistent this season with both being in the bad end of that recently. Room and Affeldt have really struggled this year, Romo especially. Last night is a great example. He comes in, gives up a couple base hits, get 2 outs, but still ends up giving up a run. It obviously didn't matter with a 4 run lead, but he almost consistently gives up a base hit or two because he really just can't get lefties out. I love Romo but he isn't getting the job done. Affeldt has been on the DL but he was shaky when he was up and that scares me. I really think they will either call up another reliever prospect or they will trade for one."
SFGiants,3czuze,es080994,2,Sun Jul 12 19:25:55 2015 UTC,"Agree Romo really can't get leftys out, but he really has been running into some absurd bad luck this year. His BABIP against is .388 compared to .264 over his career. His Left on base % this year is 60.2 compared to 76.8. His k/9 of 12.46 is the second best of his career. His walk rate is up, but everything else indicates that he should have been putting up one of the best year a of his career.  Romo should be used like Lopez is... Romo's numbers against righties are great this year, but lefties have a .513 OBP against him. He's struck out two lefties in 39 PA while striking out 34 of 74 righties.  Romo has ran into some bad luck and lefties have killed him, but he still has some really great potential value (especially against eighties)  Affeldt on the other hand is giving up tons of loud contact, career high home run rate, greatly increased walk rate and a decreased k rate... Affeldt is looking like a guy who unfortunately may be losing it (if he hasn't lost it already)"
SFGiants,3czuze,Buzzed27,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:33:49 2015 UTC,"Watching Osich has been nice, even if he isn't actually pitching well, because all he's done is gone up and gotten nothing but outs through 2 strikeouts and a ton of soft grounders and flyballs.     I'm almost at a point where I don't know if he looks good relative to our bullpen's shakiness or actually great."
SFGiants,3czuze,demetriclees,3,Sun Jul 12 19:34:19 2015 UTC,Relief pitching.
SFGiants,3czuze,Jonnydanger,3,Sun Jul 12 09:41:54 2015 UTC,"As long has we can be semi healthy the rest of the year, a bullpen player is all I care for. Sine that prob wont happen, I'd like another outfielder that can play multiple spots"
SFGiants,3czuze,codynacc,3,Sun Jul 12 15:44:41 2015 UTC,I think they'd rather get a Cueto in free agency than giving up assets for half a year of him
SFGiants,3czuze,stephcurrylightup,2,Mon Jul 13 01:12:39 2015 UTC,"We have money to spend with Lincecum's contract up, finishing paying off the park, and just in general having revenue that we haven't used for payroll. I'd wait until the offseason and throw some dough around."
SFGiants,3czuze,ndhuskerpower,2,Sun Jul 12 21:07:20 2015 UTC,"We need a starting pitcher, but at the same time at the end of this season there will be more starters available than before the trade deadline. I think we should just stick with what we have and try to make it work for the rest of the season and get an even better starting pitcher in the off season."
SFGiants,3czuze,fullmaltalchemist,2,Sun Jul 12 21:35:52 2015 UTC,"Honestly I think we need a SP and a good reliever. The Phillies may have the answers to both in Hamels and Papelbon. Casilla and Romo have been shaky all season and I'm not sure Strickland is ready for the closer's role yet. With Hamels' value at an all time low, it might be worth Evans' time to see what he/they would cost."
SFGiants,3czuze,alchemistjuice_,3,Sun Jul 12 23:10:08 2015 UTC,"Hamels interests me because the Giants are printing money at AT&T.  SF could certainly afford to take on most of that contract, meaning Philadelphia wouldn't be on the hook for too much. If the Phils didn't have to pay a ton of it, maybe they'd be willing to take less in terms of prospects?  Probably just wishful thinking, but it's worth the call.  I would at least give Strickland a shot at closing games before I tried for Papelbon.  The solution might be right in front of us.  I agree with you, though, that Romo and Casilla are not getting it done in the back end of the pen and change is needed.  For just a couple weeks before the deadline, I would see what a bullpen with some combination of Osich, Lopez, and Strickland in the 8th and 9th would look like.  Maybe throw in some Kontos - he has pitched well.  Also, is Papelbon really someone that would fit in the Giants clubhouse?  It's well-known that the guy's a jackass.  That's the trade-off for excellent on-field production from him."
SFGiants,3czuze,PackidPlays,2,Mon Jul 13 06:57:23 2015 UTC,"I still think a SP is necessary to go anywhere in the postseason, and perhaps even make it in at all.  A couple more starts from Peavy and Cain will tell us what we have in them.  If either of them do not look like good options in the rotation, I would say grab a top-tier SP right before the deadline.  Trade Susac if need be - he isn't very valuable to the team as a back-up catcher.  Secondary to starting pitching is CF.  Pagan looks hurt and, for the most part, has played like it recently.  The absolute best possible option here is Carlos Gomez - he's only signed through next season.  That does not seem like a Giants-type move, though.  Admittedly, I don't know much about what's available on the OF market this year.  One name I've heard tossed around is Gerardo Parra.  He is very interesting to me.  Decent power (7-10 HR's a season, although he will likely eclipse that this year), good BA (career .277), and Gold Glove defense.  While secondary to starting pitching, a good CF would go a long way with Pagan playing on bad legs.  The bullpen needs work, but I am not as concerned as most.  I think a reshuffling is in order more than anything.  Neither Romo nor Casilla can get lefties out at all.  Bump them down, move Strickland up.  Start putting Osich in more high-pressure situations and see what he can do.  Lopez would still be a guy who can get lefties (and some righties) out in the 8th and 9th.  Try to use Romo and Casilla against righties and avoid them like the plague against lefties.  If these ideas would not work out, maybe then a move would be needed.  An under-the-radar option would be Carter Capps.  I know he's hated here, but he's been insane this season.  While not too likely, see if Miami would be willing to give him up.  If they're not, try for A.J. Ramos."
SFGiants,3czuze,PackidPlays,2,Sun Jul 12 17:33:17 2015 UTC,"I think everything you said is pretty on point, except about susac. I think he has more value as a backup catcher than the rest of the bench so posey can get rest. He gets starts every week. But he also has the most trade value so you're kinda stuck"
SFGiants,3czuze,Obeastmode44,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:28:42 2015 UTC,"I should have phrased that better.  He certainly has value as a back-up catcher.  However, for the playing time he gets, I think he's more valuable to the Giants as a trade piece.  I would not give him up unless the return is excellent.  For me, it boils down to this: Are the Giants getting more value out of Susac as a back-up than they could get from a full-time rotation or outfield piece?  IMO, the answer's no."
SFGiants,3czuze,PackidPlays,2,Sun Jul 12 19:51:46 2015 UTC,Yeah that makes a lot of sense. But when aoki comes back we have plenty of outfielders. I wouldn't mind seeing pagan he some rest though he's looking like he needs some.

SFGiants,3czuze,Obeastmode44,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:03:36 2015 UTC,"What about trading belt instead of susac? Posey plays well at first and us more valuable.  Give Susac more starts, let Posey play first, trade Belt. I think if belt can get hot he has more value anyways."
SFGiants,3czuze,xBLASTxTYRANTx,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:22:50 2015 UTC,"Belt is still cheap, provides above average production and hits for average despite being streaky. Plus the Giants still see Posey as a catcher long term. Susac is still an unknown in terms of what he could give the team for the rest of the season."
SFGiants,3czuze,spaceinvaderMC,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:34:33 2015 UTC,I would only trade Belt if it meant I could get an OF with a similar (or better) bat.
SFGiants,3czuze,PackidPlays,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:58:31 2015 UTC,"I would not trade Belt for pitching unless I'm certain I could get a big bat in another deal.  He is a very important fixture in that lineup and I think it is far less threatening if you replace him with Susac w/o upgrading elsewhere.  If I could package Belt with some prospects and somehow wind up with Carlos Gomez, I'd do it in a heart beat.  Once again though, I would not trade Belt if it meant being unable to replace his production in the lineup."

SFGiants,3czuze,ViralOner,2,Sun Jul 12 21:50:46 2015 UTC,"Casilla was pretty much lights out until July 1st and 2nd. He let in a run today because defensive indifference gave the runner 2nd and 3rd. If Casilla can get back to where he was before July (these last few outings have been encouraging), then we won't have to overpay for a closer.  FULL DISCLOSURE: I'm biased, I have Casilla in fantasy."
SFGiants,3czuze,osborneman,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:41:43 2015 UTC,"FWIW, his FIP is a full run worse than his ERA - 4.19 vs. 3.16, so he's probably been lucky.  His BB/9 is approaching 4, which is pretty terrible, especially for a closer.  He also couldn't get a lefty out to save his life.  The Giants have capable closers in the bullpen.  Strickland's been excellent this year - he could do it.  I think the Giants could benefit from a late-inning arm, but it doesn't necessarily have to be a closer."
SFGiants,3czuze,PackidPlays,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:13:19 2015 UTC,I have him too. Maybe that's why I'm calling for his head.

SFGiants,3cy1wk,dizzmotron,2,Sun Jul 12 09:22:32 2015 UTC,I believe that this is the video you were looking for earlier. A day late though.
SFGiants,3cy8nj,lankyskanky,4,Sat Jul 11 21:26:39 2015 UTC,"I'm tired of the over-protective giants fans treating posey like their newborn baby. He is a professional athlete, more specifically an athlete that has won 3 world series, a batting title, and an MVP award as a CATCHER. This is something he has chosen to dedicate himself to, and given his success I have faith that he is capable of making good decisions. Until he decides enough is enough, no one should be talking about moving the best catcher in the league to first base."
SFGiants,3cy8nj,MVPosey,2,Sun Jul 12 10:40:36 2015 UTC,"Great username, and I agree completely."
SFGiants,3cy8nj,kasutori_Jack,2,Mon Jul 13 05:09:50 2015 UTC,"You're right. Rationally, you're right. But it's hard, as a fan of Posey and the Giants, to watch him take foul tips off of the mask and off of his wrist and hand and knee and groin constantly. He's been hurt plenty of times, and once very seriously, because he's a catcher. So I get nervous.  I way prefer him behind the plate to Susac though, as he clearly provides much more value by framing and stopping wild pitches, but it's stressful. I don't have complete faith that he will make the best decision for himself and the Giants, and I don't think that being a good baseball player has gifted him with the ability to make these decisions.  That said, I do have faith that Giants management will make good decisions, because that's what they're paid to do and they seem to have a good track record.   Defensively, he's not the best catcher in the league, but he is elite. He should stay there. I should worry less."
SFGiants,3cy8nj,The_Dill,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:26:08 2015 UTC,"Its a tough decision... You don't want the same thing that happened to Matheny happen to Posey... Good catchers are hard to come by, and its too soon to see if Susac is the real deal (long term-wise).   My dad talks to Bochy all the time, and his argument is that we've won 3 world series with him behind the plate... you can't argue with those numbers. Why change something that is clearly working?   I think unless something big happens we wont see a move to 1b for quite a few years, but it will happen... hes too valuable offensively"
SFGiants,3cy8nj,raoulduke415,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:14:50 2015 UTC,Susac crushed it today!
SFGiants,3cy8nj,sfgiantsnation,-7,Mon Jul 13 00:01:09 2015 UTC,time to move Posey to 1st...
SFGiants,3cy8nj,sfgiantsnation,19,Sat Jul 11 22:28:37 2015 UTC,I totally disagree. Posey is the best offensive catcher in baseball and he is elite defensively as well. That adds up to one of the most valuable players in baseball. You move that to first base and he loses a ton of that value.   Posey needs to stay at catcher for the next 2-3 years.
SFGiants,3cy8nj,sfgiantsnation,-8,Sat Jul 11 22:54:12 2015 UTC,"Between the Hammy problem & repeated concussions....it's time to move. Giants will be plenty of ""value"" out of him at 1st, he's an elite first baseman. It the best thing for Posey & the Giants."
SFGiants,3cy8nj,PackidPlays,12,Sat Jul 11 23:17:33 2015 UTC,"Unless I missed something, Posey's never had a concussion issue.  Also, even if he would move to first, what happens to Belt?  He's far from an actual LF and the NL doesn't appear to be getting the DH anytime soon."
SFGiants,3cy8nj,sfgiantsnation,-6,Sat Jul 11 23:28:49 2015 UTC,"The Belt experiment has played out. He is too streaky, and Posey is a better 1st basemen. Trade belt. Just because he hasn't actually been officially diagnosed the a concussion, don't think all those foul tips to the mask aren't taking their toll on dear Buster."
SFGiants,3cy8nj,hotsizzzle,10,Sat Jul 11 23:46:38 2015 UTC,Oh yea that Belt experiment has been a total disaster  .275/.350/.478 with 135 wRC+  We need to get him out of the lineup ASAP

He will produce just as well from 1st base & not take a beating in the process. Time for some new meat behind the dish. Bight the bullet now, It's best for Posey & the Giants in the long run."

SFGiants,3cy8nj,sfgiantsnation,2,Mon Jul 13 05:14:40 2015 UTC,The belt experiment? The dude is batting like 280 and is second in the league in doubles behind tod Frazier. I'm personally fine with an experiment that has that kind of results

SFGiants,3cy8nj,hotsizzzle,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:10:13 2015 UTC,But that's baseball. Unless you are tony Gwinn show me a guys who doesn't go through streaks. Posey even has streaks. Granted his good streaks are longer than his bad but almost every player goes through streaks
SFGiants,3cy8nj,NonfatNoWaterChai,9,Mon Jul 13 04:32:03 2015 UTC,Posey has never had a concussion...
SFGiants,3cy8nj,PandaLover42,2,Sat Jul 11 23:55:18 2015 UTC,The concussion issues were Hector Sanchez. His noggin was like a magnet for pitches.

SFGiants,3cvony,kuro_kuma_,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:15:56 2015 UTC,"Can confirm that it is Lexi cheering.  IIRC, I think players families still purchase tickets to games and usually sit in the family section at the ballpark."

SFGiants,3cvony,dancemonkey,2,Tue Jul 14 01:17:18 2015 UTC,He's truly a beast. Doesn't need Spring Training or rehab starts. Just give him some kale and turn him loose on the enemy.

SFGiants,3cw0sz,Tb1Anarchy,24,Sat Jul 11 06:23:59 2015 UTC,Haha yes. Then we get Ishikawa back from the Pirates and just pretend it's 2014. I like this plan!
SFGiants,3cw0sz,azureknightmare,24,Sat Jul 11 07:00:32 2015 UTC,I like this and hope they make the move. Low price and low risk since they know exactly what they will be getting.
SFGiants,3cw0sz,23JebronLames23,10,Sat Jul 11 06:45:27 2015 UTC,Andrew Baggerly said it best when he said Morse coming back would be wishful thinking unless the Marlins agreed to pick up basically all of his contract and he would platoon with Belt at 1B.   Plus there's no place for Morse except for the bench and the occasional start at 1B if Bochy wants to give both Belt and Posey the day off or an emergency OF.
SFGiants,3cw0sz,Bluehale,7,Sat Jul 11 06:52:48 2015 UTC,That's exactly what we need though. We severely lack a power hitter coming off the bench right now and if were going to be a playoff teams that's something the Giants will need.   Morse's HR off the bench against the Cards in game 5 of the NLCS was clutch. Right now Maxwell is probably the best we got at the moment..
SFGiants,3cw0sz,mhallgren5,5,Sat Jul 11 16:55:25 2015 UTC,"If we need a power hitter off the bench we have Adam Duvall who we can call up from Sacramento and wouldn't come with the price tag that Morse would have.   Believe me I love Morse and I wish there was a way we could bring him back, but realistically there's no place for him except to DH when we are playing in AL parks."
SFGiants,3cw0sz,Bluehale,3,Sat Jul 11 18:32:09 2015 UTC,"I disagree in that Duvall is enough of a power bat off the bench if the Giants are going to seriously consider a playoff run. We've had Duvall for a while and he still hasn't exactly proven himself to the majority of the fans. I much, MUCH rather have a guy like Morse coming off the bench than a Duvall. The two don't really compare, numbers sure, but Morse on the Giants is a different beast as evident of last year and now his performance for the Marlines.  Duvall ain't gonna cut it, that's small potatoes."
SFGiants,3cw0sz,mhallgren5,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:20:06 2015 UTC,"Duvall is a AAAA player. He's never really come close to replicating his Sacramento/Fresno performance on the big league level. Morse has proven success being exactly what we need, and further he loved being with the team so much last year that coming back to SF might give him a major shot in the arm. Plus then we'd get more Pence-Morse bromance. That's a win-win if I've ever heard one."
SFGiants,3cw0sz,mookie710,16,Sun Jul 12 16:28:06 2015 UTC,"This is like when you and your gf go on a ""break"". You both see other people and realize you were meant for each other. It was meant to be!!"
SFGiants,3cw0sz,throwd_away8675309,3,Sat Jul 11 07:29:03 2015 UTC,I love Morse but he isn't going to be enough. We still need to look at other options.

SFGiants,3cw0sz,uuhson,0,Sat Jul 11 07:47:24 2015 UTC,"Edging him out offensively?  Have you been watching him play these last few months?  You can't take yesterday as a representative sample of his playing.  Morse was on the DL a while this year and last.  Maxwell has started most of our games with a Pence being out.  Morse has power.  That's something we've been missing in the lineup.  Belt has it but is too prone to slumps to consistently provide it for us.  Even with Pence back, it'd be nice to have someone in the lineup or off the bench who could provide us with some power.  Let alone the chemistry he provides because we know this team runs on being fired up by its leaders."

SFGiants,3csaxz,p-wing,2,Sat Jul 11 05:39:25 2015 UTC,"Also, I rarely as a moderator ever sit back and say this, but this sub is cool as fuck. I missed most of the game and just sat here and saw most of the interesting stuff in less than ten minutes by clicking through the highlights in the GDT."
SFGiants,3csaxz,MadBum,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:39:16 2015 UTC,Panic won't beat Duffy in the hr race
SFGiants,3csaxz,mobuckets,2,Sat Jul 11 05:39:14 2015 UTC,Man I hope this game is a big turnaround for this team. We look amazing tonight
SFGiants,3csaxz,MadBum,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:38:12 2015 UTC,I am disappointed to not have seen Francouer pitch
SFGiants,3csaxz,daf1reinside,3,Sat Jul 11 05:36:42 2015 UTC,There are still two games left this series.
SFGiants,3csaxz,p-wing,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:37:46 2015 UTC,I just saw that Panik hit #69! Yayyyyyy.
SFGiants,3csaxz,BombsInTheBay,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:35:16 2015 UTC,nah it bounced in the wait continues
SFGiants,3csaxz,myriaddays,2,Sat Jul 11 05:36:27 2015 UTC,Awww. No 69 for Panik.
SFGiants,3csaxz,BombsInTheBay,3,Sat Jul 11 05:38:02 2015 UTC,I think the jumping guy counts as #69
SFGiants,3csaxz,Beatrixie,2,Sat Jul 11 05:37:53 2015 UTC,This game has been really fun for me. Anyone else having a good time?
SFGiants,3csaxz,williedills,2,Sat Jul 11 05:34:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I just wish we could do this to teams not ranked #30 in baseball."
SFGiants,3csaxz,p-wing,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:36:52 2015 UTC,We did it to the Doggers though; very consistently actually. I think we're 9-2 against them this season.
SFGiants,3csaxz,MichaeloMGB,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:40:46 2015 UTC,9-3.  Not like I'm keeping track or anything.
SFGiants,3csaxz,p-wing,2,Sat Jul 11 05:42:45 2015 UTC,Don't worry; one more win against the Doggers and we hold the series.
SFGiants,3csaxz,MichaeloMGB,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:46:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was thinking about that before we started the last 3-gamer against them."
SFGiants,3csaxz,p-wing,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:49:29 2015 UTC,Only 3 more outs  inb4   13-run   rally
SFGiants,3csaxz,demetriclees,2,Sat Jul 11 05:34:44 2015 UTC,"This will be the first non-clench, non-depressing ninth inning in a while"
SFGiants,3csaxz,drtasty,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:34:26 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, we have 22 hits."
SFGiants,3csaxz,SuckItTrebek01,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:33:41 2015 UTC,this game is still going?
SFGiants,3csaxz,kasutori_Jack,4,Sat Jul 11 05:33:31 2015 UTC,"This game was gone hours ago.  If you mean ""is it finished?"" No, not yet."
SFGiants,3csaxz,p-wing,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:35:14 2015 UTC,Poor Crawdaddy doesn't get to join in the fun :(
SFGiants,3csaxz,drtasty,2,Sat Jul 11 05:32:39 2015 UTC,He had his chance but got 2 outs in one inning!
SFGiants,3csaxz,Beatrixie,2,Sat Jul 11 05:35:06 2015 UTC,Can we just throw in GOAT to make it like 30-2 now?
SFGiants,3csaxz,DrBeardyFace,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:32:07 2015 UTC,"I think they'd have to start an extra page in the scorebook, so no GOAT saves paperwork."
SFGiants,3csaxz,p-wing,2,Sat Jul 11 05:34:37 2015 UTC,There is a reason we don't use him that much. We just want to give everyone a fair chance without using too much of the GOAT.
SFGiants,3csaxz,jwick89,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:33:05 2015 UTC,"So I'm at a pizza place is downtown San Diego and getting updates on this game and it's generally a super kick ass night. Party! Stay safe out there, party people!"
SFGiants,3csaxz,JOEYisROCKhard,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:32:03 2015 UTC,Ahhhh wow awesome to see this game still going. I watched a bit at a buddy's house and missed all the scoring somehow.
SFGiants,3csaxz,MadBum,4,Sat Jul 11 05:31:52 2015 UTC,It's like playing at Coors expect only we're at Coors and not the other team
SFGiants,3csaxz,bricktamland48,3,Sat Jul 11 05:31:07 2015 UTC,Just in time to get hot and then go on a break.
SFGiants,3csaxz,Chidar,9,Sat Jul 11 05:30:32 2015 UTC,I got a job today. And The Giants KILL. I think my unemployment was the curse.
SFGiants,3csaxz,Nonphoria,2,Sat Jul 11 05:30:08 2015 UTC,A good day for all!
SFGiants,3csaxz,throwd_away8675309,3,Sat Jul 11 05:34:35 2015 UTC,Congrats! It's so tough on your self confidence interviewing. Props on keeping it up and breaking through.

SFGiants,3csaxz,bricktamland48,3,Sat Jul 11 05:28:20 2015 UTC,"Jesus Christ, Maxwell. Where was this in the middle of the season?"
SFGiants,3csaxz,jwick89,3,Sat Jul 11 05:26:53 2015 UTC,POTG.
SFGiants,3csaxz,p-wing,3,Sat Jul 11 05:26:42 2015 UTC,The wheels came off and they have struck a village and set it on fire
SFGiants,3csaxz,SirLudicrus,4,Sat Jul 11 05:26:06 2015 UTC,Some asshole usher ticketed me in the 8th inning of an 11 run game. Jokes on him since I just moved to a better section.
SFGiants,3csaxz,Phatskwurl,3,Sat Jul 11 05:23:51 2015 UTC,"Every section is better, it's AT&T. They're all phenomenal."
SFGiants,3csaxz,p-wing,4,Sat Jul 11 05:24:37 2015 UTC,I feel like I have to burn all of my pants after this game.
SFGiants,3csaxz,p-wing,3,Sat Jul 11 05:23:33 2015 UTC,I would like to submit a request to send some of these runs to our past 10 games or so.
SFGiants,3csaxz,AnAttractivePenguin,2,Sat Jul 11 05:22:53 2015 UTC,Transfer rejected.  Transfers are only valid 90 minutes after purchase.
SFGiants,3csaxz,contextplz,4,Sat Jul 11 05:24:08 2015 UTC,I want to see a position player pitch!!
SFGiants,3csaxz,throwd_away8675309,4,Sat Jul 11 05:22:44 2015 UTC,"Belt. Please, Bochy. It's all I've ever wanted in this world."

SFGiants,3csaxz,SirLudicrus,3,Sat Jul 11 05:25:20 2015 UTC,Utley pitches. Beans Pagan with a 70 mph fastball. Benches clear.
SFGiants,3csaxz,throwd_away8675309,2,Sat Jul 11 05:23:22 2015 UTC,70 mph fastball hahaha
SFGiants,3csaxz,sutronice,5,Sat Jul 11 05:36:09 2015 UTC,We've got 21! We can drink!
SFGiants,3csaxz,BombsInTheBay,2,Sat Jul 11 05:22:36 2015 UTC,I SMELLLLZZ IT 1 more to go.
SFGiants,3csaxz,msixtwofive,2,Sat Jul 11 05:22:35 2015 UTC,"idk, can we save some offense for another night?  We better not get 0 hits next game."
SFGiants,3csaxz,alandizzle,2,Sat Jul 11 05:22:27 2015 UTC,"If this is true, it means that we would have spent a good week's worth of hits. :/"
SFGiants,3csaxz,Zerroka,5,Sat Jul 11 05:25:10 2015 UTC,We should play the phillies more often
SFGiants,3csaxz,wehopeuchoke,2,Sat Jul 11 05:22:18 2015 UTC,Colorado and Philadelphia need to trade divisions.
SFGiants,3csaxz,p-wing,3,Sat Jul 11 05:28:47 2015 UTC,That kid in catcher gear makes me wanna melt ;_;
SFGiants,3csaxz,MichaeloMGB,2,Sat Jul 11 05:21:59 2015 UTC,I thought that was Jack Posey for a second
SFGiants,3csaxz,MaxActionJackson,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:21:46 2015 UTC,Tied the record for most hits...
SFGiants,3csaxz,stephcurrylightup,3,Sat Jul 11 05:21:35 2015 UTC,Damn the company that sponsors the pitching changes for the phillies must get their money's worth
SFGiants,3csaxz,Noble_toaster,4,Sat Jul 11 05:20:40 2015 UTC,So Grant said that the Giants have the AT&T record for hits if they get 2  They obviously won't hit in the bottom of the ninth so this is the only time. It's up to Belt and Maxwell and Blanco
SFGiants,3csaxz,stephcurrylightup,3,Sat Jul 11 05:18:09 2015 UTC,"Yay, the boys came through! New record for hits at AT&T Park, wooo!"
SFGiants,3csaxz,accio7,2,Sat Jul 11 05:23:15 2015 UTC,"Did not expect this in a Hamels game, as K & K said..."
SFGiants,3csaxz,stephcurrylightup,2,Sat Jul 11 05:24:35 2015 UTC,Belt  Maxwell  Blanco  Edit: They did it :' )

SFGiants,3csaxz,kitty846,13,Sat Jul 11 05:21:02 2015 UTC,AMA Request: Cove Diver   Is your phone broken? Was that the coldest water ever? What does a soggy baseball feel like? Doggy paddle or Freestyle? Would you consent to the distribution of a bobblehead of yourself?
SFGiants,3csaxz,p-wing,2,Sat Jul 11 05:16:24 2015 UTC,I can get this AMA fulfilled(he's a friend of mine)
SFGiants,3csaxz,soupb,2,Sat Jul 11 17:13:54 2015 UTC,doooo itttt  Have him make a new thread to reap some fucken karma.
SFGiants,3csaxz,p-wing,2,Sat Jul 11 17:14:42 2015 UTC,I'm watching this at a bar.  I cannot wait to review the highlights of that.  POTG:  Cove Diver.  :D
SFGiants,3csaxz,combuchan,5,Sat Jul 11 05:53:56 2015 UTC,I wanna see a position player pitch. Keep piling the runs on!
SFGiants,3csaxz,AdumWanrit,2,Sat Jul 11 05:15:19 2015 UTC,Frenchy can pitch!
SFGiants,3csaxz,accio7,4,Sat Jul 11 05:21:01 2015 UTC,At least dude knew how to swim. it's ridiculous how many people I know/knew in the bay that couldn't swim. I guess the cold as fuck water doesn't help.
SFGiants,3csaxz,msixtwofive,3,Sat Jul 11 05:15:08 2015 UTC,"I've tipped a boat and fallen into snow runoff once. The shock is strong. If you don't get an adrenaline rush quickly, you're in trouble."
SFGiants,3csaxz,p-wing,3,Sat Jul 11 05:19:52 2015 UTC,"i just got home in time for panik HR. wow, just wow."
SFGiants,3csaxz,spike021,3,Sat Jul 11 05:15:04 2015 UTC,Do they get in trouble when they jump in the cove?
SFGiants,3csaxz,throwd_away8675309,4,Sat Jul 11 05:14:42 2015 UTC,No. You can swim there. It's just dumb and risky.
SFGiants,3csaxz,Chidar,11,Sat Jul 11 05:17:58 2015 UTC,The cove diver right now is like a sim that went into the pool and then you take away the ladder
SFGiants,3csaxz,wehopeuchoke,3,Sat Jul 11 05:13:16 2015 UTC,Machi disappointing me on the mound and at the plate!
SFGiants,3csaxz,dropperofpipebombs,4,Sat Jul 11 05:12:30 2015 UTC,So Machi has no bat nor helmet (I'm willing to bet). Whose did he have to borrow? My guess is Duffy or Pagan's
SFGiants,3csaxz,Zerroka,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:12:06 2015 UTC,"I think all the relievers still have their own helmets, actually. I definitely remember seeing Romo's name on the back of his helmet when he had an AB earlier this year."
SFGiants,3csaxz,dropperofpipebombs,6,Sat Jul 11 05:35:21 2015 UTC,rip cove diver
SFGiants,3csaxz,yoshinegus,14,Sat Jul 11 05:12:01 2015 UTC,He dived for your wins.
SFGiants,3csaxz,p-wing,4,Sat Jul 11 05:12:55 2015 UTC,Holy fuck a reliever at bat! Literally best game ever.
SFGiants,3csaxz,falloutranger,5,Sat Jul 11 05:11:50 2015 UTC,"C'mon Machi, the arcade is calling you, all the cool kids are hitting it there."
SFGiants,3csaxz,DrBeardyFace,8,Sat Jul 11 05:10:28 2015 UTC,"Actually, what does Cove Diver do now?"
SFGiants,3csaxz,Zerroka,12,Sat Jul 11 05:10:09 2015 UTC,He swims to oakland
SFGiants,3csaxz,wehopeuchoke,12,Sat Jul 11 05:11:43 2015 UTC,He becomes a merman!
SFGiants,3csaxz,Beatrixie,2,Sat Jul 11 05:10:42 2015 UTC,Machi bomb calling it
SFGiants,3csaxz,wehopeuchoke,7,Sat Jul 11 05:10:07 2015 UTC,I'm excited to see how he gets out.
SFGiants,3csaxz,iGetBuckets3,5,Sat Jul 11 05:09:31 2015 UTC,Lmao he's still in the water
SFGiants,3csaxz,UnkleRuckus420,8,Sat Jul 11 05:09:28 2015 UTC,That guy was insane.
SFGiants,3csaxz,JohnnySteel,4,Sat Jul 11 05:09:26 2015 UTC,The absolute madman
SFGiants,3csaxz,wehopeuchoke,3,Sat Jul 11 05:12:13 2015 UTC,A lunatic fringe.  Would anyone here jump into the water for a HR ball?
SFGiants,3csaxz,JohnnySteel,5,Sat Jul 11 05:13:40 2015 UTC,GUYS GUYS GUYS I JUST PUT MY PANIK JERSEY ON AND HE HITS A DONGER!!! WHAT DO I DO NOW?!?!
SFGiants,3csaxz,tehbach,3,Sat Jul 11 05:09:21 2015 UTC,"It depends.  Did you put it on, and moments later he hits it?  If so, you need to take it off to conserve the magic and put it on every time Panik is at the plate.  EVERY. TIME."
SFGiants,3csaxz,contextplz,2,Sat Jul 11 05:11:13 2015 UTC,"I literally ran downstairs to put it on when he came up, got back upstairs and see him swing and a guy jump into the water."
SFGiants,3csaxz,tehbach,2,Sat Jul 11 05:11:59 2015 UTC,Well there's your answer.  You'll be doing the good work brother.   I wish you all the dedication and strength.
SFGiants,3csaxz,contextplz,3,Sat Jul 11 05:13:56 2015 UTC,Epoxy it to your skin!

SFGiants,3csaxz,sutronice,2,Sat Jul 11 05:10:12 2015 UTC,Machi's gonna hit guys
SFGiants,3csaxz,stephcurrylightup,4,Sat Jul 11 05:09:01 2015 UTC,I hope that was a water proof phone.
SFGiants,3csaxz,hateray,5,Sat Jul 11 05:08:55 2015 UTC,Holy shit I hope he doesn't fucking drown.
SFGiants,3csaxz,SuckItTrebek01,6,Sat Jul 11 05:08:46 2015 UTC,Not sure if he can't swim or is very drunk but he does not seem to know what he's doing.
SFGiants,3csaxz,notablepostings,4,Sat Jul 11 05:10:15 2015 UTC,What happened?! I have absolutely no feed >.<
SFGiants,3csaxz,Bipolarbear_au,6,Sat Jul 11 05:09:36 2015 UTC,Homerun bounced out in the water and this crazy person jumped in and is still swimming around. No easy way out but I'm sure he'll be fine
SFGiants,3csaxz,HeroBrown,3,Sat Jul 11 05:10:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's what I'm thinking.  Those guys down by the Pier don't know how important he is to us and K&K, either."
SFGiants,3csaxz,p-wing,6,Sat Jul 11 05:09:27 2015 UTC,Panik is catching up with Duffy!
SFGiants,3csaxz,jwick89,2,Sat Jul 11 05:08:07 2015 UTC,I wish I'd elected to go to this game instead of the crappy Wednesday game. I'll regret it foreva.
SFGiants,3csaxz,Beatrixie,2,Sat Jul 11 05:07:57 2015 UTC,Shit I went Tuesday and going this Sunday so I don't think it can get better than both those gamea
SFGiants,3csaxz,Verco,5,Sat Jul 11 05:08:57 2015 UTC,So that guy can't call for help now

SFGiants,3csaxz,loneract,3,Sat Jul 11 05:06:46 2015 UTC,I feel like that guy just ruined his phone
SFGiants,3csaxz,wehopeuchoke,5,Sat Jul 11 05:06:45 2015 UTC,Pence back and the whole dynamic changes wtf is this. just wow.
SFGiants,3csaxz,msixtwofive,6,Sat Jul 11 05:06:43 2015 UTC,This is why $18m/year is insanely cheap.
SFGiants,3csaxz,p-wing,3,Sat Jul 11 05:07:49 2015 UTC,God bless the Phillies thank you

He's not into sports at all, doesn't follow MLB. I'm not feeling very well and we were cuddling in bed, I realize it's a little after the game starts and turn it on. Pence comes up, strikes out swinging on that terrible high pitch.  We settle in and start playing Mario 3D world, I still have the game open on my laptop. I perk up when bases are loaded with 1 out, see the grand slam. Mention it's Pence who just came back off the DL, he asks, ""Didn't he strike out earlier? Wow."" Ahh! There's hope for him yet. :D  Then he asked what the score was, I said 9-1, and he asked if there's a 10-run rule. As in, be ten runs ahead and you auto-win. x)"

SFGiants,3cq0oo,Chidar,3,Fri Jul 10 17:14:13 2015 UTC,Am I missing something? My personal impression after he came back was no change. Still the unreliable DP magnet.
SFGiants,3cq0oo,Fluttertwi,3,Fri Jul 10 03:07:23 2015 UTC,"He was substantially better after he came back. .169/.222/.271 with 8 GIDP's in April, .235/.291/.294 with 4 GIDP's in May, .294/.400/.412 with 3 GIDP's in June. Obviously that June sample size is quite small and isn't necessarily representative of what he's going to do going forward, but that's VERY substantial improvement."
SFGiants,3cq0oo,Chidar,2,Fri Jul 10 03:17:15 2015 UTC,I guess my judgement was clouded.
SFGiants,3cq0oo,Fluttertwi,2,Fri Jul 10 03:20:57 2015 UTC,"Well, it's not like we saw him much in June, there wasn't much to base an opinion on. And the double play rate was pretty much just as bad."

SFGiants,3cq6l3,Looks_Good_In_Hats,5,Thu Jul 9 22:05:45 2015 UTC,Remember when everyone thought Lucius Fox was a Dodger?
SFGiants,3cq6l3,BinaryFishin,3,Fri Jul 10 02:47:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah but Martinez is a Cuban. I hate to be sterotypical, but these days most top shelf Cuban talent go to the Dodgers because 1) The Dodgers will pay Martinez whatever he wants (just look at the contract they gave Hector Olivera who's in his 30's and could have TJ surgery in the near future) and 2) There's a good chance that some of Martinez's teammates back in Cuba are on the Dodgers!"
SFGiants,3cq6l3,Bluehale,3,Fri Jul 10 02:55:39 2015 UTC,However if Martinez were to come here he would have an easier path to the majors with only Pence locked up in the OF past next season and no clear successor waiting in the wings if/when Aoki and Pagan's contracts are up. That could be a difference maker when making his decision.
SFGiants,3cq6l3,Bluehale,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:40:39 2015 UTC,"Maybe. I still think the Dodgers are going to land him. If anything Martinez is probably playing the waiting game to get the best (fattest) deal possible and if that's the case it'll be the Dodgers since the Giants won't play that game.   And he's only 20 so he can afford to wait 3 years until Carl Crawford's contract is up. I know playing in OKC for the next 3 years isn't that appealing, but Martinez would be paid millions anyway."

Next thing you know, the Giants steal Fox and are apparently still in it enough that a week after July 2nd Martinez still hasn't signed with the Dodgers.   This signing period is not going how the Dodgers planned."

SFGiants,3cnt85,throwd_away8675309,4,Thu Jul 9 14:53:48 2015 UTC,"I work construction. The bast I can tell you it to look up rebar sizes and nominal lengths. Just to have a clear idea of the material. Other things would be, How much does it cost to bend the rebar for specialized footings, delivery of rebar, and labor to install the rebar. Also don't forget the twist ties, they are probably cheap but when you lay down 5,000 sq ft of 18"" O.C. rebar those ties add up. Hope that helps, good luck!"

I don't want to paint a picture of knowing too much stuff that I clearly do not, but some general knowledge on those topics is definitely good.

In game 1 Timmy is not looking so good in the first 3 innings (does he look really pale to anybody else?). He also had a weird play where he caught the runner at 3rd in a run down but didn't actually tag him out, which loaded the bases.   Also, seeing Juan Uribe as a Giant is weird!   Edit: Posey ties it in the 3rd!   Edit: Freddy Sanchez with 3 doubles in 3 AB!"

SFGiants,3cnt85,throwd_away8675309,4,Thu Jul 9 15:58:42 2015 UTC,its different for the pro players with coaches and video and stuff. but i can see how mechanical funks could happen now.   last night it suddenly occurred to me my swing was broken.  granted its softball.  but In the last 3 years i have lost all traces of power in my swing.  i never had homerun power.  but i could occasionally catch a jet stream and take one out.   and hit some to the wall once in a while for a triple.   but for the past three years.  shallow outfield is as good as it got.  frustrating i just assumed it was age.    then last night i thought.  i saw my friend 9iron a ball into right field.  all arms no lower half.   and it hit me.  i started playing golf 3 years ago.  have i stopped striding to the ball?   turns out i stopped stepping into it.  just all arms.  i wonder if golf has anything to do with it.   anyway. my last at bat. i consciously made my self take a step into the swing and hit one off left center wall for my first triple in three years.     mechanics are subtle and need tuning.
SFGiants,3cnt85,atb0rg,2,Thu Jul 9 17:20:57 2015 UTC,"I have the opposite problem. I can't get a good golf swing because I've swung a bat so many times. I'm slowly getting better at it, but the mechanics just aren't there for a golf swing yet."

He took his change in role very well, took his demotion very well, worked on his swing in the minors and came up improved.

My family holds our annual softball game at Flood Park on the Peninsula in the Madrone Picnic Area. Basically how it works is you rent out a ""site"" (with 4-5 tables and a bbq pit) and it's within walking distance of a volleyball court and softball diamond which are first come first serve.

Steve Poltz used to follow them around while travelling and they have some really great stories about pissing off Boch.   Also when the Flan Man plays he throws in lots of stories about his time with the Giants. Its pretty cool to here his inside story of what went on. Plus hearing him play a song called ""3 ring circus"" is pretty cool.  I spoke with his wife for a while.

SFGiants,3cjdep,PackidPlays,2,Wed Jul 8 21:35:18 2015 UTC,Pagan is hurt and pretty badly. They need to get him recovered.
SFGiants,3cjdep,867-5309-,3,Wed Jul 8 21:38:32 2015 UTC,"That's what I'm saying; the Giants have been looking at outfielders, which means they might not expect him to recover anytime soon."
SFGiants,3cjdep,stephcurrylightup,2,Wed Jul 8 21:42:27 2015 UTC,We should all be thrilled with Peavy's performances since his return from injury; so many media types were dismissive of him and hopefully he'll continue to make them look like fools.
SFGiants,3cjdep,Scilaci,2,Wed Jul 8 21:37:45 2015 UTC,I hate this ballpark

SFGiants,3ciml6,-spacecat-,6,Wed Jul 8 06:16:32 2015 UTC,my old man is always talking shit about bonds and i just dont get it. maybe its cause I was a pretty small time fan while he was playing but i still like the dude
SFGiants,3ciml6,Dranzogger,7,Wed Jul 8 06:13:35 2015 UTC,Giants fans who hate Barry Bonds are a segment of the population I just will never understand. We all have our flaws I suppose.
SFGiants,3ciml6,-spacecat-,7,Wed Jul 8 06:19:04 2015 UTC,what i dont understand is he seems to be under the impression that all giants fans hate bonds  idk i dont mind PEDs and how can you hate dingers?
SFGiants,3ciml6,Dranzogger,7,Wed Jul 8 06:24:15 2015 UTC,"There is one dinger I can easily hate. But yeah, I can sort of comprehend someone who is a Giants fan somehow also hating Bonds, but I can't understand why they would think that's a universal thing among their fellow Giants fans."
SFGiants,3ciml6,-spacecat-,2,Wed Jul 8 06:29:53 2015 UTC,"It wasn't only the PEDs, it was also the ""Imma park my La-Z-Boy in front of my locker because I can"" ""Kanye before there was Kanye"" type self-absorbed, self-serving attitude.  Just sayin what it was about. Personally, I ignored the drama and just enjoyed Bonds on the field, but be forewarned, there will come a day when you're explaining to the next generation why some people hate the Panda."
SFGiants,3ciml6,time_to_despair,3,Wed Jul 8 12:15:05 2015 UTC,"i think bonds from '02-'07 was kinda shitty when he had that stupid dangly earring and was really only playing to break the HR record, and he very much exuded an ""i'm better than you"" attitude.   but this is the greatest baseball moment i've ever seen and any baseball fan should recognize the brilliance"

SFGiants,3ciml6,MrSalvadorian,5,Wed Jul 8 05:27:10 2015 UTC,Did anything come of that? Like did the usher honestly tell you guys you couldn't talk at a baseball game or something? There's no way any usher could seriously think people shouldn't talk at the game.
SFGiants,3ciml6,KobraCola,7,Wed Jul 8 05:35:26 2015 UTC,"No he came up, sat a few seats away from us while we carried on as usual, and then left a couple innings later.  I saw the lady and him exchanging looks and pointing to us too lol"
SFGiants,3ciml6,NateTheGreat8,3,Wed Jul 8 05:43:46 2015 UTC,"I once had an usher tell me to get off my phone.  She said someone texted that fair or foul number and I had my suspicions about who tattled on me.  I was just trying to arrange post-game plans with my friend, but he couldn't text because he was driving.  It was one of those games where the Dodgers were killing the Giants and most people had already left."
SFGiants,3ciml6,Blast-Off-Girl,3,Wed Jul 8 06:39:15 2015 UTC,"Jesus. If they started policing everyone who took their phone out during the game, they'd have to hire 1,000 more ushers and wouldn't be able to address any serious concerns. That's so silly, especially in that context."

SFGiants,3ciml6,theonetruegrinch,9,Wed Jul 8 05:32:57 2015 UTC,"Simply ridiculous, Nate posted it in the GDT but I can recap it here.  So me and Nate are just chitchatting and whatnot bout the game when we start talking bout people who are always on their phones at games are buzzkills. The lady in front of us turns around and says ""I'd rather you guys go texting than talk and ruin the game for us"". Me and Nate are just in disbelief like did that just happen?   Unfazed, We continue talking when she makes another remark and tells us to stop talking so loud and ruining the game. We aren't even that loud and are just enjoying the game. Then later an usher sits a few seats down from us and like keeps an eye on us as we keep talking. We're just like ""did they call an usher on us? Like really?"" The best part is we just continue our chit chat while the usher is still watching us and he gets up and leaves without saying a word. Hilarious! and the couple in front of us didn't say anything for the rest of the game."

SFGiants,3ciml6,chloedadog,6,Wed Jul 8 05:46:07 2015 UTC,Which section was this?  I think Giants fans have a bad reputation for this hoity toity behavior at games.  It's not a fucking library.
SFGiants,3ciml6,Blast-Off-Girl,7,Wed Jul 8 06:40:53 2015 UTC,"We were sitting in the upper decks behind home plate. That was the first time that ever happened to me at a game but man, it's a game. People are going to talk and socialize, it's not a movie lol"
SFGiants,3ciml6,MrSalvadorian,2,Wed Jul 8 07:35:15 2015 UTC,"I was sitting there too! 315. There were a bunch of kids and high schoolers that actually enjoyed the game, talked and cheered loudly. It was awesome. Too bad you weren't in our spot."
SFGiants,3ciml6,leadhase,3,Wed Jul 8 16:18:10 2015 UTC,"I had that happen to me at a hockey game a couple years back. My friend and I were talking about a multitude of things, most of which involved hockey and the Sharks, and right before the end of the first period this older guy sitting in front of us turns around and tells us to stop talking because he ""didn't come to the game to hear us commentate."" After giving each other a dumbfounded look, we got up to get nachos, and when we returned to our seats there was a security guard standing in the aisle behind us just staring at us for the entire second period. It was absolutely surreal."

Cain did superb and had a few great stops/plays himself, im glad hes back up and running.  My seats were amazing, couldnt have asked for better. i got to see my favorite player make an amazing throw, i could damn near hear it haha.  only downside was a few latin dudes (who all had a heat on) got in the faces of a family, including making one of the two sons cry, over seats that im fairly certain they had no claim to. assholes.  otherwise it was the best tuesday in a damn long time"

SFGiants,3ciml6,theonetruegrinch,6,Wed Jul 8 05:27:59 2015 UTC,"they were across the aisle so i didnt witness the entire thing. luckily there were two guys sitting behind the family who did just that. and then bought both kids hot chocolate. pretty badass of them, wish i had shook their hands.  unfortunately the ushers didnt boot them, i guess their tickets were valid (but i have my doubts). they did hang around for a little while and repeatedly told them to sit down. but at the bottom of the 7th she left and they got back to it.   really sucks because they were decked out in Giants gear, and there were lots of Mets fans around us (including i think the family). left a bad taste in my mouth, but the Mets fans right next to us understood that theres always a few."

SFGiants,3ciml6,rogerdaltry,2,Wed Jul 8 07:52:09 2015 UTC,Gotcha. I'll see about it tomorrow and will make sure you get a gif if I find a good segment.
SFGiants,3ciml6,superplatypus57,2,Wed Jul 8 07:57:46 2015 UTC,"It was after the end of the inning. Pence made the catch and throw to nab Granderson at home plate, then Daniel Murphy grounded out to Craw. Either right after that or when they came back from commercial (I think it was the latter), the broadcast showed Pence re-entering the dugout after the top of the 6th, and everyone in the dugout was high-fiving him and butt-patting him and then Cain hugged him too."

Another long day in the books! I went to the de Young Museum in the morning, then visited City Hall, Ferry Building in the afternoon prior to the Giants game. (Quite a unique late lunch I had of oysters and iced coffee, but I'll take it LOL!) I arrived at the ballpark right when the gates opened, and explored the outfield perimeter of AT&T just before meeting up with my friend and her husband. (Unfortunately, ran out of time, and wasn't able to explore the new CF garden.)  I finally got to see the Trio for myself between the fourth and fifth inning tonight!

The hate was loud after Holliday slid into Scutaro. The love was louder when Scutaro picked himself back up, later scoring a 2-RBI single, leading the Giants to a crushing 7-1 win over the Cards.

SFGiants,3cgo34,demetriclees,6,Tue Jul 7 23:06:05 2015 UTC,"With the occasional blip, Blanco is a good outfielder. His best career fielding percentage is actually in center field, not left field or right field (respectively: .995, .988, and .985).     If Blanco could keep up the great year he's been having, Aoki in LF, Blanco in CF, and Pence in RF would be a great outfield.     Pagan has been frustrating to watch lately, because I know what he can do, but he seems incapable of doing it. He really needs some time off to perhaps heal, because he at least had a decent start. He's been at his worst ever since he started beating himself up in the outfield to make plays."
SFGiants,3cgo34,its_hammer_thyme,3,Tue Jul 7 20:26:49 2015 UTC,Has there been any update on when Aoki is expected to come back?
SFGiants,3cgo34,dylansesco,2,Tue Jul 7 21:23:58 2015 UTC,No timetable but he says the bone is healing well.   Pence should be back any day.
SFGiants,3cgo34,amichael15,6,Tue Jul 7 23:08:04 2015 UTC,"I understand he's slumping, and the stats are down.  But why is everyone forgetting how hot he started this season? He was like our best hitter for a while until Aoki kept up. Am I taking crazy pills?  edit: just quickly checked, and he was batting over .300 until June. Seems like right around the time he missed some games. So maybe the lingering injury is the cause of him not picking it back up."
SFGiants,3cgo34,p-wing,4,Tue Jul 7 23:46:28 2015 UTC,Yes his fist 80 at bats of the season were above average. Even then he still wasn't drawing walks or hitting for power.   His 200 at bats since then have been well below average.
SFGiants,3cgo34,MLBVideoConverterBot,3,Tue Jul 7 23:59:36 2015 UTC,.300 doesn't mean much when you're not scoring runs or knocking them in. He has 19 rbis and he's been hitting behind Aoki and Panik most of the time both of whom have .380+ obp. That's hard to believe. He currently has a .300 OBP coming into today. He's been bad.
SFGiants,3cgo34,aarong707,6,Wed Jul 8 04:10:23 2015 UTC,"Seconded.  We can all see Pagan struggling to hit (I started noticing it in earnest about two months ago), and his defense just doesn't make up for it. With Pence out, our outfield looks like garbage at the plate."

The runner ahead of Pagan had tied the game up, Pagan was into 3rd easily and at that point there was only 1 out.  If Pagan is tagged, the game remains tied, there are two outs and the 'easy' sac fly is removed from play.  I can only imagine the reaction that would have occurred if he HAD been tagged at the plate."
SFGiants,3cgo34,amichael15,5,Tue Jul 7 22:52:27 2015 UTC,All I know is that the Giants are hard to beat when he's firing on all cylinders. The all star break will be good for him

SFGiants,3cgo34,TweetsInCommentsBot,2,Wed Jul 8 03:52:03 2015 UTC,I've been feeling this for a month but Pagan's on the downside and it's not going to get any better.  I'm certainly not blaming him for our slide but his hot start simply delayed the inevitable.    We are in trouble and there's no denying it.  We need to get healthy and get hot and maybe we can sneak in and beat the odd year curse.

SFGiants,3cgzzb,TimBoras,7,Tue Jul 7 23:13:13 2015 UTC,I think Heston is a legit 3. He's shown some flashes of being a legit 2 but he's barely a rookie

He's never been highly touted, and we all know from recent Bay Area experience that no-hitters and perfect games aren't indicators of a great pitcher.    Regardless, this is a Giants team that at one point had 3 legit #1 starters.  Now we are down to 1 and a bunch of fill-ins."
SFGiants,3cgzzb,TimBoras,2,Tue Jul 7 23:49:34 2015 UTC,The funny thing now is we went from being a team with tremendous pitching with adequate hitting to an almost tremendous offense with an adequate pitching staff.

Add in Pence whose done his usual thing when healthy and a potential rebound in Pagan and that's a pretty formidable offense that could even compare favorably to the Dodgers."

GPS cords in case that link doesn't work.  37.763804, -122.391757  There is also a MUNI stop at 3rd and Mariposa so you could take MUNI two stops to the ballpark if you wanted to.

SFGiants,3cgvwc,revocer,3,Thu Jul 9 19:08:40 2015 UTC,"Generally speaking pricing may fluctuate depending on the game and day.    I can't remember if it's 2nd, 3rd, or 4th Street.  Right under the 80 overpass is the best pricing I have seen.  The closer you get to the park on the park side of the 80, the more expensive.  The closer you get to the downtown on the downtown side of the 80, the more expensive.  Right under the overpass seems like the sweet spot.  It's still expensive though.    WARNING: If you try street parking, read the street parking signs extremely carefully.  There used to be some hidden gems for weekend games, but I think they are all gone."
SFGiants,3cgvwc,spike021,3,Tue Jul 7 20:57:07 2015 UTC,I wouldn't even recommend street parking near there. I've had a new job right near Caltrain the past 4 weeks and almost every day I see a new mound of shattered glass on the sidewalk from a car that's been broken into.

SFGiants,3cgvwc,jseeba,3,Wed Jul 8 12:43:20 2015 UTC,Park with Luxe Valet.   Use code USELUXE for a credit towards your first park.
SFGiants,3cgvwc,The_Battler,2,Wed Jul 8 04:51:06 2015 UTC,Luxe is awesome.  You drive your car right next to the ballpark.  A guy on a scooter comes up and drives away with your car.  You press a button on your iPhone and it shows up wherever you are after the game.  Costs something like $15/max --- cheaper than the lots around.

SFGiants,3cgvwc,saqar1,2,Tue Jul 7 22:59:44 2015 UTC,"Park in Lucerne Street. It's a dead end alley way on Brannan between 6th and 7th streets. There's usually a couple spots open before gametime and although it's in an alley way, some nice condo's and startups occupy the street so there are camera's all over. You won't have to worry about a break in, or the ridiculous parking fee's. It's like a 10 minute walk from the ballpark."

SFGiants,3cevka,gothicel,2,Wed Jul 8 05:19:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but they're the second-worst hitting team overall, the Phillies, so it's sad that the Dodger pitchers are letting them score so many runs."

SFGiants,3cevka,Beatrixie,3,Wed Jul 8 05:00:48 2015 UTC,It seems that now is as good a time as any to remind everyone that the existence of the closer position leads to nothing more than irresponsible managing.

SFGiants,3cevka,Deucer22,2,Wed Jul 8 05:00:11 2015 UTC,"Right?  I wanna see how long that guy can go. I say, the next time we take the starter out early they keep him out there for as long as he is pitching well."

SFGiants,3cevka,falloutranger,6,Wed Jul 8 04:56:13 2015 UTC,Why is it necessary to bring in another relief pitcher right now? Osich can come out and pitch to the first batter (a righty) and the second batter (a lefty) and we can go from there.
SFGiants,3cevka,ndhuskerpower,2,Wed Jul 8 04:56:06 2015 UTC,Because every pitcher must have their set-in-stone role no matter what! /s

SFGiants,3cevka,KobraCola,2,Wed Jul 8 04:58:53 2015 UTC,"Oh, I don't disagree. We just need to have Aoki back and then Pagan can get some longer rest. Maybe now with Pence back, we can give Belt some time in left.  Has Maxwell played left this year? I forgot."
SFGiants,3cevka,gothicel,2,Wed Jul 8 05:18:03 2015 UTC,"Yes, he's played 9.1 innings there apparently. If Pagan needs rest/to be DL'd cause he's injured, then I get it, but as brutal as Pagan has been, Maxwell has actually been a worse hitter, so not the best solution IMO."

SFGiants,3cevka,mtheory007,3,Wed Jul 8 04:53:24 2015 UTC,That's the only thing I can think of. I really hope the All Star break up soon get back to form.
SFGiants,3cevka,Information_Landmine,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:53:24 2015 UTC,"I sure hope so. I mean, he would normally make that a very close play or even beat it out."
SFGiants,3cevka,mtheory007,2,Wed Jul 8 04:54:30 2015 UTC,Yeah he's normally got a ton of hustle you can tell something physically isn't going right
SFGiants,3cevka,falloutranger,2,Wed Jul 8 04:55:28 2015 UTC,Pagan needs that ASG break fast.
SFGiants,3cevka,KelbyMay,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:20:07 2015 UTC,Wow a new record for Pagan. First pitch DP
SFGiants,3cevka,c45c73,2,Wed Jul 8 04:53:14 2015 UTC,That was not the first pitch...
SFGiants,3cevka,c45c73,2,Wed Jul 8 04:52:55 2015 UTC,Fucking A.  And I thought we had depth in the outfield...
SFGiants,3cevka,Beatrixie,6,Wed Jul 8 04:53:50 2015 UTC,Pagan just orchestrated that as an homage to McGeehee

SFGiants,3cevka,SirLudicrus,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:54:30 2015 UTC,I predict that at some point Pagan goes to the bench for Maxwell. Maxwell needs to learn better plate discipline first though
SFGiants,3cevka,Captain_Blue_Tally,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:52:22 2015 UTC,"At this point, I'd take Maxwell. Pagan really needs a break, he's in no condition to play right now. :("

SFGiants,3cevka,falloutranger,3,Wed Jul 8 04:59:13 2015 UTC,He's hurt dude. He almost went to the DL
SFGiants,3cevka,C666O,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:54:20 2015 UTC,He should.
SFGiants,3cevka,chloedadog,2,Wed Jul 8 04:52:54 2015 UTC,remember when he said he'd play every day game early in the season? i'm hoping it's just bench depth that's keeping him in the lineup and nothing ego related.
SFGiants,3cevka,KobraCola,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:56:45 2015 UTC,"Oh, I'm sure they would've DL'd him when he got hurt, but can't have 3 back-up OF's out there. Before Pence came back, it was already fairly painful to watch, besides Blanco."
SFGiants,3cevka,AvastYeUpboat,3,Wed Jul 8 04:54:37 2015 UTC,You'd think they would just modify a batting helmet so it's comfortable and not ridiculous looking.

SFGiants,3cevka,AvastYeUpboat,2,Wed Jul 8 04:51:31 2015 UTC,That's the exact piece I was thinking.
SFGiants,3cevka,pdp_8,2,Wed Jul 8 04:54:56 2015 UTC,"Hell, that thing actually looks pretty cool. I'm guessing it's the ""ermagerd, can't see ter team logo!"" marketroids preventing that."

The fact that your team had to play a Sunday night game on the road and the go across the country to play a game at home tonight is just pathetic. MLB needs to fix that in the scheduling because that is unfair to any team to have to go through that experience. Given how tired some of those players must have been with the travel, the fact that the Giants players managed to get themselves into scoring position at times is just amazing. Also, what happened with the series between the Marlins and the series with the Nationals?

The Mets were up and down in an extreme way the last two weeks; they go 1-7 on the road, go back home and sweep the Reds but then get swept by the Cubs at home. In fact, I had low expectations for the Mets on this road trip but I have been surprised. At least the Mets beat the Dodgers twice this past weekend so things aren't out of grasp for the Giants in the NL West division despite the loss to the Mets tonight."

But regardless, you start walking to the umpire, he clearly says stop twice, you get run, every single time.  That's his (and his catcher's!) fault, not cuzzi's.

Sure it's neat to see a guy throw 100+ MPH, or someone else manage to hit that 100 MPH+ ball, or make a great diving catch or turn an amazing double play, but the real art and majesty of Major League Baseball is watching a fat old guy try to accurately judge where a ball thrown 90+ MPH crossed home plate.

SFGiants,3cbt6h,MikeOxIittle,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:03:38 2015 UTC,"Onley usually has good sources. The acquisition would replace Pagan, not Pence or Aoki."
SFGiants,3cbt6h,PackidPlays,6,Tue Jul 7 02:41:33 2015 UTC,Parra has more value in my opinion.  I saw him play a lot better against us when he was on the Dbacks compared to seeing Maybin when he was on the Padres.  Plays better defense and would work well in the right field if something is up with Pence moving forward.  Maybin's value is probably a bit too high right now and he would be an overpay.  Brewers will be selling much lower.
SFGiants,3cbt6h,readwrite_blue,5,Mon Jul 6 20:52:20 2015 UTC,I think the concern is more about Pagan's legs than Pence's wrist.  Just last night Bochy said it could only be a few days until Pence is back.

SFGiants,3cbt6h,amichael15,2,Tue Jul 7 14:19:47 2015 UTC,Feel like Parra always played well vs. us
SFGiants,3cbt6h,alwaysreadthename,2,Mon Jul 6 23:03:30 2015 UTC,"The problem with Parra is that he's really a corner outfielder even though he's been filling in for Gomez a lot this year. As a CF he has negative drs, as a RF he's a monster but that's not where the Giants can play him. Aoki has similar positional splits in fewer innings and isn't a CF himself. Point being if we're looking for someone to play CF it's not Parra. Maybin on the other hand can do it but really isn't much of an offensive upgrade over Pagan."
SFGiants,3cbt6h,TweetPoster,2,Tue Jul 7 08:22:20 2015 UTC,Maybin Career BABIP: .319  Maybin 2015 BABIP: .348  Gerardo Parra has been hitting but has been a disaster in the outfield this year. His BABIP is also 20 points higher than normal. I wouldn't be eager to acquire either.

SFGiants,3cckmg,clearlygonemad,2,Tue Jul 7 03:17:41 2015 UTC,"Of only it were still the late 1800s:  ""Despite increased status, umpiring in the major leagues was an uncertain, stressful, and even dangerous occupation through the end of the century. Frequent revisions in the rules and innovations in playing techniques made the umpire's job exceedingly difficult, while the physical and verbal abuse from fans and players alike often made an umpire's life intolerable. Umpires were routinely spiked, kicked, cursed, and spat upon by players, while fans hurled vile epithets and all manner of debris at the arbiters. Mobbings and physical assaults were frequent, so much so that police escorts were familiar and welcome sights to the men in blue. The transformation of the umpire from esteemed arbitrator to despised villain was largely deliberate. As club owners and league officials recognized that umpire baiting boosted gate receipts, they refused to support the umpires' field decisions, dismissed or paid player's fines, did little to curb rowdiness, and even joined sportswriters in depicting umpires as scoundrels and scapegoats. Occasionally umpires retaliated by hurling objects back into the stands or by punching players and reporters--and were summarily punished for so doing. But most found other jobs. In an era when ""Kill the umpire!"" was not mere rhetoric, there was a high turnover rate in umpires as few men were willing to endure such trials and tribulations for paltry pay and poor working conditions."""

SFGiants,3c8sw1,clearlygonemad,23,Mon Jul 6 05:41:52 2015 UTC,"Crawford and Panik probably should've been starting too, but that would be nitpicking. All the choices in the NL except Matt Holliday were pretty good."
SFGiants,3c8sw1,Fluttertwi,25,Mon Jul 6 19:14:57 2015 UTC,"Much as I love Panik, Gordon is have one hell of a first half."

SFGiants,3cafxv,marmot_thumb,6,Tue Jul 7 04:29:43 2015 UTC,"So in all honesty, when Timmy comes back they should put him in the bullpen. I know it isn't what he wants to do, but we have extra starters and we have relievers who can't get the job done anymore. I love you Romo, but you just don't get it done anymore. This team isn't as bad as it has looked the past couple weeks. Our offense will get back up, our pitching is relatively okay. Our bullpen is really what is absolutely killing the team right now."
SFGiants,3cafxv,es080994,3,Tue Jul 7 04:29:14 2015 UTC,"Lol EVERYTHING is killing the Giants right now. Every game, someone says a variation of either the bench, bullpen, or starting pitching being what's killing this team. The truth is that it's all fuckin 3 and help can't come soon enough."
SFGiants,3cafxv,gbassman5,4,Tue Jul 7 04:31:46 2015 UTC,"In this (almost 7) 6 game losing streak the starters have not done that bad, minus Bum. The offense has even put up 3 or more runs in a few games. As a whole, the team really isn't playing well as of late and that's obvious. A constant issue throughout this season though is the extremely shaky bullpen. Romo really doesn't do much for the team anymore, Affeldt is super all over the place (literally), Casilla is the definition of inconsistent, Machi is ehh, Strickland, Kontos, and Javy are really the only relievers that I feel comfortable with on the mound and Strickland barely made that list. We would be going to extra innings if we had a half decent bullpen right now."
SFGiants,3cafxv,es080994,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:34:46 2015 UTC,"I wasn't really disagreeing w u, just saying they need lots of help all around. I definitely agree that bullpen should be first priority."
SFGiants,3cafxv,gbassman5,0,Tue Jul 7 04:40:37 2015 UTC,The Core Four is really getting old. Romo and Casilla are in their late 30's. Affeldt and Lopez are in their 40's. Luckily we have a ton of good arms in Sacramento we should be calling up soon.

SFGiants,3cafxv,falloutranger,5,Tue Jul 7 04:13:19 2015 UTC,It blows my mind that Romo still gets ABs vs Lefties. He can't use his only plus pitch against them.   vs righties: 188/.211/.362    vs. lefties: .379/.486/.448
SFGiants,3cafxv,alwaysreadthename,3,Tue Jul 7 04:13:11 2015 UTC,Did that cocky piece of fucking shit just do his dance move just now? I switched screens real quick and caught the tail end of him moving? Did he just fucking do that? Please tell me he tripped.

Dockers Deck Looking for a unique group space to take in a game with a birds-eye view of AT&T Park? Look no further. Dockers Deck will provide just that! The Dockers Deck is located atop the platform at the base of the glove in Center Field. Enjoy a sweeping view of the ballpark, Bay Bridge and Oakland Hills from this new memorable event space!     I've stood up here a few times on a SRO ticket. It is very hard to see the game action from there. I don't know if I would pay good money to sit up there. How much are the tickets if you don;t mind me asking?"
SFGiants,3cb07j,dodgerh8ter,3,Mon Jul 6 17:39:06 2015 UTC,"$60 with access to Club level stuff too, which I think is food/lounge/bathroom"
SFGiants,3cb07j,dodgerh8ter,2,Mon Jul 6 17:39:58 2015 UTC,Ouch. Honestly I think that is way too much. Does it come with food? It is really really hard to see the game from there. If you are there to party and it comes with food and beer I think 60 is a fair price. If you are there to see the game you won't see much of it without binoculars.   Please report back if you go and tell us what you thought of it.

If you are willing to take more of a risk try the Gametime app. 100 bucks a ticket you shouldn't have any trouble finding something. My advice, buy the cheapest ticket you can get. Sit way up top or get standing room only tickets. Your first time to AT&T you will spend more time walking around checking out everything than you will spent in your seat watching baseball and there is nothing wrong with that.  As long as you don't do the chop welcome to AT&T park and have a good time. No one cares about your baseball team we just don't want to hear that incessant droning on and on."

SFGiants,3ccj8m,SergioSF,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:21:47 2015 UTC,Plenty of tickets go on sale the day of the game on stubhub or seatgeek. You will have to print your tickets out before hand if you buy them from another e-ticket vendor if you are not buying from stubhub.

SFGiants,3c96v8,skyshadow42,12,Mon Jul 6 02:07:54 2015 UTC,"The strike zone is the strike zone, period.  Umpires with their own interpretations and also being shitty at their jobs in general adds NOTHING to the game.  This only makes a hard game HARDER.  Then you have vets getting more calls then rookies, that shit ruins careers.  I've seen it happen to people like Todd Linden, so many BS strikeouts looking that guy had.  Seriously, set the strike zone, have PitchFX tell us if it's a strike or not.  We don't need fat men with engorged egos/bellies back there."
SFGiants,3c96v8,RBCsavage,2,Mon Jul 6 03:27:02 2015 UTC,"I mean, it's their job at stake. If things continue like this, eventually everyone will be on board with a computerized strike zone. Right?

I hope."

SFGiants,3c9fjn,phessler,5,Mon Jul 6 08:35:19 2015 UTC,It's strange that the Giants didn't play at all last week.
SFGiants,3c9fjn,JackMasterAndrew,6,Mon Jul 6 05:42:33 2015 UTC,Pagan needs to pull his head out of his ass. Between his terrible jump on Posey's two out base hit and his lazy play in center he directly cost the Giants two runs.   It's bad enough that he is having the worst offensive year of his career but these mental mistakes tonight were a killer.
SFGiants,3c9fjn,lankyskanky,4,Mon Jul 6 03:30:42 2015 UTC,his left leg is screwed up i think. or knee. sounds pretty bad and like he's playing through it since we have no other options.

SFGiants,3c9fjn,hateray,2,Mon Jul 6 05:43:12 2015 UTC,"Seeing as the Giants are in another slump I decided to revisit the ""Why the Giants team will win the world series/not"" thread from the /r/baseball over the early part of the year. There was one post in that thread by a Dodgers poster that made sense back then and in light of the up and down season the Giants have had so far makes sense now. Of course the Giants could correct this slump and win the World Series again who knows.   https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/2zsxgy/why_will_the_giants_win_the_world_series_why_wont/cpmsef6  For those who don't have the time to read the post it basically stated that the Giants struggle in odd years mainly do to some players regressing (Bumgarner, Cain, Lincecum), the loss of major contributors (Sandoval, Morse, Melky) and some players resting on their laurels (Pagan, Sandoval) and the top prospects in the farm system still a year away.   But while the odd years are a bust for the Giants the poster wrote that the Giants use the odd year seasons to call up players from Sacramento or Richmond and give them valuable playing time so that in the even years they become key contributors to a World Series run. The poster probably forgot to mention the odd years are where the Giants suffered a lot of injuries (sounds familiar) to key players."

SFGiants,3c9fjn,GenButtNekkid,4,Mon Jul 6 08:38:14 2015 UTC,"Well, we are one step closer to getting an automated strike zone. So I guess that is nice. I'm so over watching umpires attempt to call balls and strikes. I mean you have to realize that some of these pitches are only off the plate by millimeters and are going 90mph. There's no way you can expect a human to accurately call balls and strikes. The technology is there, level the playing field so no teams get shafted."
SFGiants,3c9fjn,Jonnydanger,3,Mon Jul 6 04:02:10 2015 UTC,"The only way we ever get an automated strike zone is if the WUA collapses. Which will never happen. The umpires union will fight anything automated tooth and nail, and MLB doesn't want to risk pissing them off and having to find replacement umps when they go on strike."
SFGiants,3c9fjn,dropperofpipebombs,4,Mon Jul 6 04:31:45 2015 UTC,The umpires are losing their leverage fast. If the MLB develops and really feels confident about an automated strike zone then what leverage do the umpires have? Oh you're going on strike? Well good because every aspect of your job can now be done with 100% accuracy at most likely a much cheaper price. If an automated strike zone is implemented then the umpire's sole job will basically just be calling people safe or out. Which is something we already don't really take seriously because if you disagree you can just review it. The best thing for baseball would be a game where every call is called correctly. There is nothing good about missed calls. Today the umpire was calling strikes on pitches that were INCHES away from the strike zone. That is bad baseball.
SFGiants,3c9fjn,Jonnydanger,5,Mon Jul 6 04:46:37 2015 UTC,"It will happen when the fans say enough is enough. This is the game of baseball, not Umpireball. They don't get to make up their own strike zones. For nearly 200 years, the zone has been over the plate, above the knees, below the shoulders. You don't get to make up your own zone.  What to do with the entirety of the WUA? Beavis has the answer: fire them all. Replace with reliable automation. Done and done.  http://imgur.com/1NUlbXf"
SFGiants,3c9fjn,sabat,3,Mon Jul 6 04:35:52 2015 UTC,"There's no way you can expect a human to accurately call balls and strikes.   But as long as umps call them the same way for both teams, it's still a level playing field."
SFGiants,3c9fjn,time_to_despair,2,Mon Jul 6 05:45:40 2015 UTC,"that's the most important part, imho.  I like that different umps have (slightly) different zones.  but the zones have to be consistant during the game, otherwise it's bullshit."
SFGiants,3c9fjn,phessler,2,Mon Jul 6 08:35:07 2015 UTC,"Maybe with a large sample size each team, home and away, get a similar amount of bad calls. However, in a small sample size, like a 7 game series, one team can certainly get the short end of the stick.   Baseball is a game where one bad strike or ball call can change an entire at-bat and one at-bat can change an entire game. There has to be around 5-10 bad strike/ball calls per game. That really affects the outcome of the game like it or not.   Just 3-4 years ago people thought it was crazy to have replay in the game. Now it seems crazy that there wasn't replay for all that time.   If, I, at home in front of my TV can do a better job of getting the balls/strikes and safe/outs calls called correctly(in a timely manner) then something needs to change. Good competition needs a level playing field.   I love football but the subjectiveness and how often refs get pass interference calls wrong make it hard to take seriously. Baseball has a chance to be a 100% accurate/pure competitive sport when it comes to an even playing field, why not capitalize on that?"
SFGiants,3c9fjn,Jonnydanger,1 point,Mon Jul 6 09:17:35 2015 UTC,"I've said it before - I don't want to watch robot baseball. Sports by their nature include elements of chance and a sense of humanity.   Replay doesn't really bother me, but I wouldn't say I couldn't imagine - or even that the game was diminished - without it. If replay disappeared tomorrow, I'd be fine with that. The majority of the replays seem to get confirmed, or are so close that it could go either way, and I have no problem with an ump simply using judgement on hairline close calls. I do find replay entertaining, but certainly not necessary.  Football is such a different beast, I don't even want to get into it."

SFGiants,3cb2ua,Quakes98,3,Mon Jul 6 15:15:17 2015 UTC,Huddy - Backend guy for a team that needs rotation help (Nats?)  Vogey - ??  Timmy -  Backend guy for a team that needs rotation help  Affeldt - Still a good bullpen arm
SFGiants,3cb2ua,turlockmike,3,Mon Jul 6 16:02:37 2015 UTC,"Huddy and Vogey could potentially have a tiny bit of trade value, but Timmy has pretty much 0 I imagine. All you'd get for hudson or vogey would be a 28 year old reliever in A-ball or something of that caliber. We're too close to the deadline for any of them to have enough of a resurgence to be dealt for anything of value, but by holding on to them, if you think they're useful pieces at all, the Giants can continue to see where this season goes and hopefully compete. So I'd say that since they have no useful trade chips except for their players they're never going to trade, then no.  That being said, I could see them trading Belt because I believe he has what, 2 years left? This would only be if they think they can get good value for him AND they're ready to move posey to 1st base, neither of which I expect. Again, not advocating for a baby giraffe trade, just saying that it's possible it could happen."

SFGiants,3c6qwe,SSxeno,2,Mon Jul 6 03:04:02 2015 UTC,This year he has. Strickland really learned a lot up in AAA and it's shown. And he hasn't given up a home run (yet).
SFGiants,3c6qwe,Bluehale,2,Mon Jul 6 03:02:16 2015 UTC,He's been good this year. He wasn't so good last year. I think he's gotten better with his secondary pitches. I still don't trust him yet though.
SFGiants,3c6qwe,Dariisa,4,Mon Jul 6 03:01:48 2015 UTC,I really think that was CF's ball btw. Not sure why people think Belt should've had that. Can't think of many corner outfielders who get to that

We are the reason they make money and they have to make us happy. Not the other way around.    Edit: Here is a copy of the message I submitted to Dodgers:    ""I am a Giants fan, but Dodgerfilms represents the joy of being a baseball fan and baseball fans are the reason your organization is profitable. Rather than throw legal action at Bobby Crosby, I believe you should put that man on your payroll so that he may continue delivering positive and fun baseball videos, legally, to the rest of the MLB community. I believe your organization is making a costly mistake with its current actions. Please get in touch with reality here. Thank you for your time."""
SFGiants,3c4zo9,sfsports,22,Sun Jul 5 20:15:54 2015 UTC,That guy is awesome.
SFGiants,3c4zo9,LeftoverBun,17,Sat Jul 4 22:16:20 2015 UTC,Best kind of fan.  Can't help but love what he's doing.
SFGiants,3c4zo9,CynCity323,22,Sat Jul 4 23:40:59 2015 UTC,Save Bobby
SFGiants,3c4zo9,Suck_My_White_Ass,16,Sat Jul 4 22:30:02 2015 UTC,"Of course Time Warner would do that. Damn, I love the guy's videos."
SFGiants,3c4zo9,mpgiii,17,Sat Jul 4 22:06:26 2015 UTC,"As I said in /r/Dodgers:   ""There's petitions and things going around but I don't think that's going to help.  I think the best bet is for Bobby to find a way to contact the MLB and get the ""express written consent"" he needs. It seems that everyone, even the higher-ups, in the MLB love his videos and I'm sure they could work something out to allow him to continue filming the games and making his videos.""   Thanks for the support here in the rival team's subreddit. It really means a lot that we can unify for a cause like this."
SFGiants,3c4zo9,FreakInThePen,15,Sun Jul 5 03:23:47 2015 UTC,Can you provide any additional info?  Why are the Dodgers trying to shut him down?
SFGiants,3c4zo9,JackMasterAndrew,22,Sat Jul 4 21:46:18 2015 UTC,Bobby explains everything here
SFGiants,3c4zo9,SkolDog,25,Sat Jul 4 21:55:13 2015 UTC,"""Over 90% of my viewers are children and they send me messages all the time saying that they never liked baseball before but they're getting into it now because of these videos. and most of them are becoming dodgers fans."" Well we can't have that. Haha just kidding, anyone who promotes loving Baseball is cool in my book, even a dodger fan.    It's really cool Vin Scully learned his name and all that, I think all of us would die to get a personal shout out from Kruk, Kuip, Miller or Flem."
SFGiants,3c4zo9,JackMasterAndrew,11,Sun Jul 5 00:15:26 2015 UTC,"Watch the video linked in the title. It has to do mlb's ""express written consent"". My guess is Time Warner is jealous. (Their apparent goal is for NOBODY to watch the Dodgers at home)."
SFGiants,3c4zo9,KobraCola,8,Sat Jul 4 21:53:47 2015 UTC,But he mainly shows highlights. Usually it's about as much exposure as a recap that MLB posts on their websites.
SFGiants,3c4zo9,themando,2,Sat Jul 4 22:02:58 2015 UTC,Not to mention the MLB and the Dodgers themselves routinely feature his stuff on their official websites.... It definitely seems like both of them don't have a problem with him filming at all and someone else is pulling these strings. Fuck you TWC.
SFGiants,3c4zo9,TufffGong,2,Sun Jul 5 15:28:11 2015 UTC,"Hey! Thanks for posting this here (I love Dodgerfilms, it would be a travesty to see the videos stop), but just a heads up - there is no video link in the title (or in your text post). Might wanna edit that in. :)"
SFGiants,3c4zo9,kittysparkles,13,Sun Jul 5 01:04:00 2015 UTC,This is the guy always snagging balls during BP right? Love this dudes channel
SFGiants,3c4zo9,KobraCola,6,Sun Jul 5 00:31:23 2015 UTC,I just want to thank all the GiantsBros that are supporting this. I'm a DodgerBro living in Rio de  Janeiro and DodgerFilms is the closest I'll get to going to a game.  I've been Internet raging hard today because of this. I even made #savedodgerfilms t-shirts but they got pulled due to legal reasons.
SFGiants,3c4zo9,dylansesco,4,Sun Jul 5 04:31:22 2015 UTC,"I wrote the Dodgers telling them that I hate everything they stand for and I hope they lose every game for the rest of eternity until L.A. crumbles into a smoldering pile of ashes that slips into the ocean, but that Dodgerfilms should be there to film every moment and it's an absolute travesty to shut him down, considering what he's done for the sport. #FreeDodgerfilms"
SFGiants,3c4zo9,rohit275,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:29:46 2015 UTC,Well said.
SFGiants,3c4zo9,cinnabon69,4,Mon Jul 6 10:55:22 2015 UTC,"I know we normally hate you guys (and vice versa), but y'all are pretty cool. Thanks for supporting Bobby, hopefully this gets resolved in the best possible way."
SFGiants,3c4zo9,49_Giants,3,Sun Jul 5 07:19:40 2015 UTC,I JUST STARTED WATCHING THIS series #savebobby
SFGiants,3c4zo9,deprivedaccountant,5,Sun Jul 5 03:16:49 2015 UTC,"This is some bullsh*t.    There are very few things in this world that give me more giddy pleasure than seeing the Bums lose and their fans miserable.  I let the schadenfreude flow through me and it feels good.  But this dude is a FAN.  If he was born in the Sunset or in San Mateo, he'd have camped out on Market for all three parades.  And I know if I was born in Santa Monica (ugh!) or Silverlake (bleah!) I'd bleed a disgusting color too.  All fans are cut from the same cloth--it's not his fault that his portion of the cloth didn't come in a lovely shade of orange.    Giants fans are allowed to shi*t on their fanbase--MLB is not.  The Bums' front office definitely is not.  You hear that, MLB and Bums?!  Making dodger fans miserable is OUR job.  You leave that dude alone."
SFGiants,3c4zo9,MVPosey,2,Sun Jul 5 15:27:30 2015 UTC,I hate the dodgers even more for this shit. You don't have to like the team but as a baseball fan those vids showed just how fun it is to be at a ballgame. In no way shape or form is it malicious content that effects that damn organization.
SFGiants,3c4zo9,KobraCola,2,Sun Jul 5 10:58:23 2015 UTC,"coolest dodgers fan there is, I can't understand for the life of me why the team would want to shut this guy down."
SFGiants,3c4zo9,NurVonugh,2,Sun Jul 5 10:35:30 2015 UTC,"Considering the Dodgers and MLB have posted his stuff on their official sites multiple times, it seems likely someone else is pulling these strings. Fuck TWC."
SFGiants,3c4zo9,Me_talking,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:30:40 2015 UTC,I actually stumbled across this guy some how (Die hard Giants Fan)This is messed up i was jealous that there isn't a giants fan like this.I didn't even think on the whole written concent thing but lets show support subscribe and like guys the more he gets in the next weeks could help this guys out.Viewership is what mlb wants maby they can work out a deal with him.
SFGiants,3c4zo9,KobraCola,1 point,Sun Jul 5 10:16:15 2015 UTC,I just wonder how much money this dude is making that he got Dodger's attention? I have seen more than a couple of his videos and he's a friendly guy that sells (or gives away?) tickets to people which includes getting them a ball.   Like we see people record footage of whatever took place at a game so does that mean MLB should crack down on everyone that records footages of whichever game they were at?
SFGiants,3c4zo9,skyshadow42,0,Mon Jul 6 00:27:56 2015 UTC,"From what I've read, he doesn't profit at all, actually. I don't know if that's 100% accurate because, while I was aware of him before, I didn't go out of my way to follow what he does or anything, but apparently he didn't opt-in to the way you can monetize your YouTube channel (presumably because then the Dodgers/MLB could have sued him for making a profit off them) and apparently he just gives away any ball he catches to kids. Not sure about the tickets part though."
SFGiants,3c4zo9,utuxia,1 point,Mon Jul 6 07:14:57 2015 UTC,Exactly what I'd expect from a classy organization like the D*dgers.
SFGiants,3c4zo9,poec_one,0,Mon Jul 6 02:09:22 2015 UTC,This just makes me want to watch pirate streams from SportsDevil more....I may just cancel my MLB.tv subscription next season. Fuck them.

SFGiants,3c4zo9,alwaysreadthename,-53,Sat Jul 4 21:25:20 2015 UTC,"Huh, why didn't you post this in /r/Dodgers???  Edit: So I'm getting downvoted because OP didn't mention that this is a crosspost from both /r/Dodgers and /r/baseball. Like I'm supposed to check other subs for stuff like this. You people are stupid.  Any one of you could have mentioned that this was already posted in /r/Dodgers, instead of downvoting me. Thanks for nothing."
SFGiants,3c4zo9,Mikey_Mayhem,14,Sat Jul 4 22:06:24 2015 UTC,Because this guys is the epitome of a great fan who is getting screwed.
SFGiants,3c4zo9,alwaysreadthename,-16,Sat Jul 4 23:24:28 2015 UTC,"But OP would get more traction in the Dodgers sun than he's getting here.  Fuck, why not post this in r/baseball? If this is about a great fan, than this should apply to all of baseball, not just this sub."
SFGiants,3c4zo9,Mikey_Mayhem,9,Sun Jul 5 00:08:36 2015 UTC,because its been posted to those subs already. OP is spreading awareness.
SFGiants,3c4zo9,KobraCola,-17,Sun Jul 5 00:21:08 2015 UTC,"Did OP crosspost this to other subs?  Because when I checked his post history, he didn't.  Edit: No, he didn't. https://www.reddit.com/user/sv7nsson/submitted/"
SFGiants,3c4zo9,Mikey_Mayhem,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:59:18 2015 UTC,"Even if it hadn't been posted in /r/Dodgers or /r/baseball, what's the harm in posting it here?"
SFGiants,3c4zo9,KobraCola,0,Sun Jul 5 15:32:06 2015 UTC,"what's the harm in posting it here?   Where do I imply that there is??? Did I say there was? Or did people simply read more into what I wrote and thought I was being an asshole, because that's what they did.  I was simply asking a question and before anyone was willing to answer it (approximately 3 hours after my original post), people started downvoting me. Look at my follow-up posts. Only one person even takes the time to fill me in on what this Dodgerfilms thing is."
SFGiants,3c4zo9,Mikey_Mayhem,2,Sun Jul 5 21:28:25 2015 UTC,"Well, it's sort of implied because your original statement was ""Huh, why didn't you post this in /r/Dodgers???"" When someone says something should be posted elsewhere, the implication is that it doesn't belong here. Yes, to me, it seemed like you were being rude. If you didn't know what Dodgerfilms was, couldn't you have googled it? Or looked in /r/Dodgers to see if it had been discussed there?"
SFGiants,3c4zo9,KobraCola,0,Sun Jul 5 21:31:56 2015 UTC,"Words have no inherent meaning. People give words, meaning. You all read what you wanted to read.   Yes, to me, it seemed like you were being rude.   That's on you. It's not my job to spell out exactly what I'm saying. I was simply asking a question. How does, ""Huh, why didn't you post this in /r/Dodgers???"", imply rudeness? If I asked you this question face-to-face, would it sound rude to you?   When someone says something should be posted elsewhere, the implication is that it doesn't belong here.   Where do I say that the post should be posted elsewhere? I asked why didn't OP post this in the Dodgers sub. Big difference. See, you read what you wanted to read. You took my simple question and turned it into something else.    If you didn't know what Dodgerfilms was, couldn't you have googled it?   Or how about I ask the people in the sub where it's posted to fill me in on what Dodgerfilms is about and someone respond, not with downvotes, but with an answer. I didn't know what Dodgerfilms was and it was of no importance to me, so why should I take time to google something, when I can ask people on reddit while I'm browsing reddit?   Or looked in /r/Dodgers to see if it had been discussed there?   Or how about I check OP's post history (which I did) to see if he posted this elsewhere, seeing as he didn't mention that this was crossposted from other subs.  Edit: People are still downvoting my original comment without reading my follow up comments. Stupid people. Here downvote this too. Do you think I care about fake internet points?"
SFGiants,3c4zo9,gsofmnd,0,Sun Jul 5 21:49:43 2015 UTC,"Of course words have inherent meaning. If they didn't, then how could we communicate? How could you know what I'm saying? Words have their own inherent meanings, but people sometimes use words in a certain combination to get across implicit messages. I read what you wrote.  Well it seems like I'm not the only person who felt it was a bit rude. Perhaps you should word your question in a different manner next time. Obviously multiple people inferred something from your words. In a face to face conversation, it would depend on our relationship, your tone, and your body language. Unfortunately, I don't have the latter two in an online discussion forum, so I have to take the context clues I can get.  Where do you say that the post should be posted elsewhere? You say it when you say ""Huh, why didn't you post this in /r/Dodgers???"" What about ""Huh, why didn't you post this in /r/Dodgers???"" isn't discussing the post being posted elsewhere? No, I read exactly what you said. That isn't even a good straw man argument.  You can ask people in the sub, but isn't googling much simpler? To ask, you have to formulate the question, save the comment, and then wait an undetermined amount of time before someone even responds, never mind if they give you a good answer. To google, you just highlight, right click, ""Search Google for '[blank]'"". The latter seems much simpler to me. Plus you risk downvotes when you ask.  It wasn't crossposted from other subs. This post talks about Dodgerfilms, like other posts in other subs have, but it's not taken directly from those subs. It's a separate discussion on the same topic. OP isn't necessarily the person who would have started discussing that topic on other subs."
SFGiants,3c4zo9,Xeteh,-60,Sun Jul 5 22:18:53 2015 UTC,"No. Don't care, even a little"
SFGiants,3c4zo9,gsofmnd,41,Sat Jul 4 22:28:03 2015 UTC,You know how every fanbase has shitty fans?  You're ours.  Hate the Dodgers for the rivalry... But their fans are people who love their team as much as you love yours.  Respect that.
SFGiants,3c4zo9,leadhase,-9,Sun Jul 5 00:59:05 2015 UTC,Not true. Just don't give a shit about a guy recording YouTube videos about the Dodgers. Bring the downvotes
