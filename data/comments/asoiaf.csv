asoiaf,3e2fv3,lmMrMeeseeksLookAtMe,201,Tue Jul 21 13:07:23 2015 UTC,"Some people believe Rosamund is indeed doublling for the dead princess.  Which will make things interesting if the ambush Cersei is planning to use to kill Trystane (and blame on ""Half Man"" Tyrion) in fact backfires and (Cersei thinks) she ended up killing her own daughter instead. Trystane meantime has his own double at the event and was never in danger.   Much more satisfying for the Martells.  Cersei will undoubtedly go on a mad spiral meltdown as a result, espceially if Cersei also tries to send Ser Strong after Margaery and Tommen steps into the way to protect her.   edit: misspelled Trystane."
asoiaf,3e2fv3,brashendeavors,72,Tue Jul 21 14:07:20 2015 UTC,"This would be perfect, especially if cersei is the one who ends up killing tommen. She would then die thinking she killed 2 of her kids, preferably having jaime kill her"

asoiaf,3e2fv3,madamfray,62,Tue Jul 21 15:38:41 2015 UTC,"the 50/50 madness is from years of inbreeding on the targaryan side, there is no magic incest madness rule."

asoiaf,3e2fv3,Broken_Sky,19,Tue Jul 21 17:44:01 2015 UTC,In which book/chapter is it that she plans to ambush Trystane?
asoiaf,3e2fv3,Cuntsuela,27,Tue Jul 21 18:48:20 2015 UTC,"It is from A Dance With Dragons. The Watcher:   Prince Doran took a jagged breath. “Dorne still has friends at court. Friends who tell us things  we were not meant to know. This invitation Cersei sent us is a ruse. Trystane is never meant to reach  King’s Landing. On the road back, somewhere in the kingswood, Ser Balon’s party will be attacked by  outlaws, and my son will die. I am asked to court only so that I may witness this attack with my own eyes  and thereby absolve the queen of any blame. Oh, and these outlaws? They will be shouting, ‘Halfman,  Halfman,’ as they attack. Ser Balon may even catch a quick glimpse of the Imp, though no one else will.”"
asoiaf,3e2fv3,brashendeavors,7,Tue Jul 21 18:53:25 2015 UTC,of course it is also possible Prince Doran made it all up :D
asoiaf,3e2fv3,brashendeavors,5,Tue Jul 21 18:56:44 2015 UTC,"Even if it is indeed Rosamund, it seems a bit weird to me to have to maim her to make her substitute for a dead Myrcella then expect her to stay loyal.  I was already on the verge in Jeyne's case about why she didn't throw out the truth to any Northern lord, but she hasn't been maimed, so before Ramsay got to her she had no reason to really betray the Lannisters and Boltons because they are both still perceived as in a very clear position of superiority (she would gain very little from not playing her part).  Why wouldn't a maimed Rosamund tell the truth to Balon Swann as soon as she had the opportunity? The Lannisters are still perceived as strong while the Martells are weak, and the Martells just maimed her to cover their lies.  This is not even counting the fact that she'd be even younger than Jeyne and Jeyne isn't able to act convincingly to fool the northern lords.  And then you get all the meta reasons with all the already-set-up substitutions that would make yet another a bit redundant."
asoiaf,3e2fv3,Elr3d,3,Tue Jul 21 14:17:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah it would be cool, and I like when bad things happen to Cersei, but it's not adding up for me just yet.  They'd have to be holding something over Rosamund's head.  Maybe Myrcella is actually just in custody and they told Rosamund they'll kill her if she talks?"
asoiaf,3e2fv3,moondoggle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:45:24 2015 UTC,"I mean if they were going so far as to maim her, wouldn't just the threat of killing her be enough? I don't see why this is so far-fetched."
asoiaf,3e2fv3,FasterDoudle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:49:34 2015 UTC,It's the maiming that's far fetched. It doesn't really follow that a few people saw the princess with a head wound so they cut off her friend's ear. Even if the princess is really dead.
asoiaf,3e2fv3,wilst,269,Tue Jul 21 15:39:54 2015 UTC,"If everything else fits, then this can easily be explained away. Rosamund is ambitious and would like to be heir to the throne, Rosamund isn't actually hurt but wears a covering over part of her face because ""the scars are too hideous"", Rosamund is brainwashed. I'm not subscribing to the theory yet, but I think it could be worked out pretty easily.    And then you get all the meta reasons with all the already-set-up substitutions that would make yet another a bit redundant.   They already are redundant, though. If anything, it's a writing pattern for GRRM at this point. How many identity changes do we have within the series?   Jon Snow / Targaryen Aemon / Targaryen  Griff / JonCon Young Griff / Aegon Sansa / Alayne Fake Arya / Jeyne Reek / Ramsey Snow  Reek / Theon  Bran & Rickon / Miller Boys Head on a stick / Davos Lady Stoneheart / unCat Arya / No One Mance / Rattleshirt Mance's baby / Gilly's baby Arstan / Barristan Asha Greyjoy / random fisherwoman  Raven / Bloodraven   And unconfirmed:   Gravedigger/ The Hound Robert Strong / The Mountain Sarella / Alleras Pate / No One Knight of the Laughing Tree / Someone (probably Lyanna) *The Harpy / Someone (probably The Green Grace)   And that's without going into Dunk & Egg or the histories. Rosamund / Myrcella would fit right in."
asoiaf,3e2fv3,showme_yourmoves,128,Tue Jul 21 17:52:14 2015 UTC,Well i guess Rosamund would benefit just based on the fact that she becomes a princess
asoiaf,3e2fv3,Heffaklump45,117,Tue Jul 21 18:23:08 2015 UTC,They might just have bandaged Rosamund's face up to make her harder to recognize and faked the maiming.  I've always found it very disturbing that we never see Myrcella after the assassionation attempt. With so many fake deaths there could easily be fake survival too :(
asoiaf,3e2fv3,metruesta,99,Tue Jul 21 18:23:56 2015 UTC,"She is still in dorne, and he's just one kingsguard thats got nothing on the sandsnakes bad poosy's. But yeah, im skeptical too. I see her dying, just not yet. George will find a way to make it more personal, to make cersei even crazier"
asoiaf,3e2fv3,BryndenBFish,114,Tue Jul 21 14:26:50 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's Rosamund. The only way that it could be Rosamund is if the Dornish chopped off Rosamund's ear. Why? Well, Kevan Lannister tells Cersei what's happened to Myrcella:   ""Myrcella was attacked by a Dornish knight named Gerold Dayne. She's alive, but hurt. He slashed her face open, she … I'm sorry … she lost an ear."" (ADWD, Cersei I)   Kevan Lannister knows this, because Balon Swann has written him about the incident -- an incident that Myrcella has pinned on Darkstar:   ""Prince Doran says nothing of your brother. And Balon Swann writes that Myrcella puts it all on this Gerold Dayne. Darkstar, they call him."" (ADWD, Cersei I)   Regardless of how well Balon Swann knows Myrcella by sight (He is only appointed to the KG after Ser Preston Greenfield is killed in ACOK), I don't believe that Doran is at the point of mutilating children even by the end of ADWD. Given Doran Martell's extreme reluctance to put children in danger at least by the end of ADWD, I have sincere doubts that Doran would give the okay to harm a true innocent like Rosamund. I don't doubt that Doran will be forced into an untenable position at some point in TWOW where he believes that he has no choice but to harm innocents (putting Myrcella to death would be the big one), but that moment hasn't arrived in the story yet."
asoiaf,3e2fv3,BryndenBFish,63,Tue Jul 21 14:48:46 2015 UTC,"I agree that's the main fault in this theory, but I do believe Doran's main goal is to give the illusion of peace to the Lannisters until Quentyn returns with Daenerys. I think it's why Dorne will side with Aegon in TWOW. The charade is falling apart quicker than Doran anticipated because of Arianne's and Oberyn's wild card moves, so he throws his eggs in the first basket available. At this point he can't risk Myrcella's death being found out before he gets his pieces into place, in which case I think he'd be willing to harm this girl."
asoiaf,3e2fv3,BryndenBFish,158,Tue Jul 21 15:03:45 2015 UTC,"While I'm of similar mind RE: Doran's alliance with the Young Dragon, I think the death of Myrcella & mutilation of Rosamund rushes the thematic impact for why Doran will move towards allying with Aegon & the consequences of this alliance.   In the Arianne Sample Chapter, we actually catch a glimpse of how GRRM will structure Doran's turn away from Daenerys as the vehicle of vengeance.    ""Where are the dragons?"" he asked. ""Where is Daenerys?"" and Arianne knew that he was really saying, ""Where is my son?"" (TWOW, Arianne I)   In short, Doran believes that Quentyn is dead, and that he has to find another way. That other way is through Aegon. But the price of vengeance will be a steep one for Doran. The Dornish, the Golden Company and any friends in the Reach may not be enough to vault Aegon onto the Iron Throne.  So, I expect Aegon to form an alliance with the Faith Militant. And that alliance will have consequences for Doran as he holds the incestuous daughter of Jaime and Cersei in his grasp. Doran will likely be forced into a circumstance where he has to choose between the new regime with his daughter as Queen or the life of an innocent -- Myrcella.  I believe he'll choose to hand Myrcella over to the Faith, and we'll come full circle to the point which started the Dornish quest for vengeance: the deaths of children and Doran's turn towards Tywin-esque methods to achieve his ends."
asoiaf,3e2fv3,AryaStarkBaratheon,25,Tue Jul 21 15:31:42 2015 UTC,"Well I like that a lot, I was already thinking about how this theory touches on the theme of the family seeking vengeance for murdered children ends up hurting children, but that addresses it in a much better way."
asoiaf,3e2fv3,eddstannis,7,Tue Jul 21 15:43:38 2015 UTC,"I've been doing a lot of reading/re-reading on the Dornish, Aegon & the Faith Militant in preparation for an upcoming essay series, so the material is sort of fresh in mind. :) And I don't want to shoot down your theory altogether. I think it's a cool idea, and fakeout identity is a definite theme in the books. It's just that, in my opinion, this fakeout would conflict with the theme that Martin seems to be building TWOW around -- the consequence of vengeance and the death of innocents.  If interested, check out /u/nfriel's essay on the topic of sacrificing children in TWOW -- it gives a strong thematic underpinning for how some of the slaughter of children will be couched thematically."

asoiaf,3e2fv3,Roccondil,13,Tue Jul 21 15:54:28 2015 UTC,"That would make sense, but I do not see Doran choosing vengeance over hurting an innocent. I think, in fact, that he will meet his demise for acting honorably, as Ned did before."

The third was well done and set up multiple backstories.    The fourth (potentially) seems unnecessary on multiple fronts and lazy. I am not hyped.  However, I am totally pumped for GRRM to pull the rug out from under the Cleganebowl supporters with a much more interesting fate for Cersei and Robert Strong.  edit:  And my comment had two semi-related clauses (if that's the correct term), I meant that the 4 trials solve a plot impasse and the 4th is redemptive of the Hound.  Not that all 4 were redemptive; the wording was wrong."
asoiaf,3e2fv3,Sunuvamonkeyfiver,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:14:28 2015 UTC,"Maybe I don't know what you mean by ""impasse"". As an ""impasse"" is a ""a situation in which no progress is possible"", I would think the solution to an impasse would be the only solution possible. I think that even the whole sand snake stuff could have been set up differently (with oberyn dying in another spectacular fashion). Unlike Tyrion in the first trial, where he was in the custody of a crazy woman and a moon door, Tyrion was in the black cells locked ""safely"" away but could escape, if he had a friend. And Sandor was in the mercy of the BWB, so the only way he was walking out of there was a trial by combat. The Oberyn-Clegane fight, I don't think it moved anything that couldn't have been moved differently.   I think the next trial (Cersei's) is, IIRC, set up to happen. It would require something extraordinary from stopping it from happening. Which could be great! I'm not GET HYPE about it, as much as I like the hound (how'd he ever become ""joffery's dog"" anyway), I won't be disaapoint without cleganebowl. But I do think Robert Strong, appearing before all men to see, will expose Cersei as a liar who claimed to have sent the Mountain's head to dorne, when all men know, only one man is as big as the mountain. So I do think Robert Strong will have a public show, which would only be at a Trial by Combat so I expect at least one more TbC for the series."

So if Jaime were to become Hand of the King, the chain would become his.   Thus, if he were to strangle Cersei with it, he'd certainly be ""wrap[ping] his hands around [her] pale white throat.""  Interesting to note also that Catelyn once referred to Cersei's throat as being pale and white.   Also, I don't believe personally that Jaime is the valonqar. I personally believe it's Arya, but there are probably about 100 people who arguably qualify and have motive to kill Cersei."

asoiaf,3e2zbj,moondoggle,5,Tue Jul 21 16:58:42 2015 UTC,"Since you are citing that the poison Cressen used is the exact same one on Joffrey, you should also review the evidence in that prologue as to why it cannot be in the pie.  First off, it seems that the poison has to be dissolved in order to work.    Dissolved in wine, it would make the muscles of a man’s throat clench tighter than any fist, shutting off his windpipe. — ACOK, Prologue   Second, the description of the poison matches almost exactly to the ""black amethysts"" that are in Sansa's hairnet.    Collapsing into his chair, he pulled the stopper and spilled out the vial’s contents. A dozen crystals, no larger than seeds, rattled across the parchment he’d been reading. They shone like jewels in the candlelight, so purple that the maester found himself thinking that he had never truly seen the color before. — ACOK, Prologue   //a few edits:   Lastly, /u/MikeyBron has reminded me of this somewhat more explicit piece of foreshadowing. (Give credit where credit is due here.)    The chain around his throat felt very heavy. He touched one of the crystals lightly with the tip of his little finger. (Emphasis own)   And I'd like to bring up again this prophecy from the Ghost of High Heart that occurs but a few chapters before the Purple Wedding, signaling that the poison is in fact in Sansa's hair:    ""I dreamt of a maid at a feast with purple serpents in her hair, venom dripping from their fangs."" — ASOS, Arya VIII"
asoiaf,3e2zbj,glass_table_girl,2,Tue Jul 21 16:26:52 2015 UTC,"I made a thread about this theory a few years back, there's a pretty simple solution for this:   A serving man placed a slice of hot pigeon pie in front of Tyrion and covered it with a spoon of lemon cream.   The poison could be in the cream."
asoiaf,3e2zbj,Harpa,4,Tue Jul 21 17:08:02 2015 UTC,"I had a lot of thoughts just now, the most important one being: ""What does pigeon taste like with lemon cream (which I think of as sweet)?""  I want to say it sounds gross, but I've also eaten duck fetus eggs, so I can't talk.   Anyway, yes, I think the cream is a pretty logical explanation.   However, as I've brought up before, that still leaves us with the loose end of poison being directly attributed to Sansa's hairnet in the Ghost of High Heart prophecy. The use of ""purple serpents"" and ""venom"" brings up the obvious connotations of ""poison,"" and the archetype of the ""maid"" is most manifest in Sansa."
asoiaf,3e2zbj,glass_table_girl,4,Tue Jul 21 17:11:48 2015 UTC,"In Hong Kong (and actual chinese restaurants in the US), they serve a deep fried pigeon with lemon slices and a spice salt. It's positively delicious. My chinese in laws thought it was the strangest and most amusing thing that the picky eater American (who married into the family), would eat pigeon over fried rice.  Putting lemon in a cream doesn't necessarily need to be sweet (except for the natural sweetness in cream, and lemons I guess). It would be more tart then anything else. Pigeon is quite gamey tasting, the lemon freshens it up. Seriously though, you should try it...."
asoiaf,3e2zbj,confettinettie,-1,Tue Jul 21 17:31:52 2015 UTC,"Haha, I can imagine it with lemon. It's the cream that's getting me.   But you've sold me on how this delicious would be.

Or I could just go visit Hong Kong. Always wanted to."
asoiaf,3e2zbj,glass_table_girl,5,Tue Jul 21 17:34:40 2015 UTC,"First off, it seems that the poison has to be dissolved in order to work.   It doesn't say that. It just describes what happens if you dissolve it in wine. What happens if you put it in lemonade? Or cookies? Nothing?   Second, the description of the poison matches almost exactly to the ""black amethysts"" that are in Sansa's hairnet.   Yes that was handy wasn't it _^    Just like it was handy that it was Tyrion's pie that Joffrey chose to eat. Why did he choose Tyrion's pie?   More questions:     How did the Tyrells know Joffrey would order Tyrion to put wine into a chalice? They just hoped he might?  What would have happened if Sansa had decided NOT to wear the amethyst hair net? They just hoped she would?  Why would Queen of Thorns have trusted Littlefinger not to tell on them later? They thought maybe he wouldn't?  What seems more ""George-like"", an overly complicated plot that had 40 different possible things that could go wrong before during and after -- or Cersei tries to poison Tyrion and accidentally kills her own son?   edited last sentence."
asoiaf,3e2zbj,glass_table_girl,5,Tue Jul 21 16:40:29 2015 UTC,"And what of the Ghost of High Heart, who describes Sansa as a maid with purple serpents in her hair and venom dripping from their fangs?   What seems more George-like is that he sets up foreshadowing for events so that they don't seem like twists that come out of nowhere but rather something that is hinted at happening. Otherwise, you end up with something that is too close to a deus ex machina.   Here's a spiel from Roger Rosenblatt on surprise:    Why, for example, do the great writers use anticipation instead of surprise? Because surprise is merely an instrument of the unusual, whereas anticipation of a consequence enlarges our understanding of what is happening. Look at a point of land over which the sun is certain to rise, Coleridge said. If the moon rises there, so what? The senses are startled, that’s all. But if we know the point where the sun will rise as it has always risen and as it will rise tomorrow and the next day too, well, well! At the beginning of “Hamlet” there can be no doubt that by the play’s end, the prince will buy it. Between start and finish, then, we may concentrate on what he says and who he is, matters made more intense by our knowing he is doomed. In every piece of work, at one juncture or another, a writer has the choice of doing something weird or something true. The lesser writer will haul up the moon.   Article"

Cercei says so much horrible stuff to Tyrion, she could have directly told him she'll poison his pie, and I wouldn't have given it a second thought. lol"

asoiaf,3e2a2h,twbrn,58,Tue Jul 21 18:49:34 2015 UTC,"It's actually awesome to see an author be supportive of the collective crew that creates an actual show out of their work. What's even better is when book fans support the author's support of the show.  That's called respect, and a lot of fans lack it when it comes to shows/movies and their  adaptations of source material. Look at all the many adaptations of Jane Austen's books there are. Or Charles Dickens. Neither are alive today to lend their opinion of these adaptations, but if their opinions were favorable, I'd certainly give their words about it the credit they deserve, and respect it. That's why I don't trash Dan & Dave and the show. If George can accept it, then so can I. It's not all about me, a fan, and my petty feelings and personal control issues."
asoiaf,3e2a2h,Harpy_McSnarky,135,Tue Jul 21 14:53:49 2015 UTC,"I mean, if I was so much as a coffee-running intern for game of thrones, I'd feel pretty damn proud. Shattering ratings records, bringing mature fantasy stories to a whole new audience...Game of Thrones is a historic show, tbh. It's a cultural phenomenon, and it'd be hard not to be proud of that."

asoiaf,3e2a2h,AfricanRain,14,Tue Jul 21 15:27:46 2015 UTC,"DID SOMEONE SAY SEPTON MARIBALD?  “Ser? My lady?” said Podrick. “Is a broken man an outlaw?” “More or less,” Brienne answered. Septon Meribald disagreed. “More less than more. There are many sorts of outlaws, just as there are many sorts of birds. A sandpiper and a sea eagle both have wings, but they are not the same. The singers love to sing of good men forced to go outside the law to fight some wicked lord, but most outlaws are more like this ravening Hound than they are the lightning lord. They are evil men, driven by greed, soured by malice, despising the gods and caring only for themselves. Broken men are more deserving of our pity, though they may be just as dangerous. Almost all are common-born, simple folk who had never been more than a mile from the house where they were born until the day some lord came round to take them off to war. Poorly shod and poorly clad, they march away beneath his banners, ofttimes with no better arms than a sickle or a sharpened hoe, or a maul they made themselves by lashing a stone to a stick with strips of hide. Brothers march with brothers, sons with fathers, friends with friends. They’ve heard the songs and stories, so they go off with eager hearts, dreaming of the wonders they will see, of the wealth and glory they will win. War seems a fine adventure, the greatest most of them will ever know. “Then they get a taste of battle. “For some, that one taste is enough to break them. Others go on for years, until they lose count of all the battles they have fought in, but even a man who has survived a hundred fights can break in his hundred-and-first. Brothers watch their brothers die, fathers lose their sons, friends see their friends trying to hold their entrails in after they’ve been gutted by an axe. “They see the lord who led them there cut down, and some other lord shouts that they are his now. They take a wound, and when that’s still half-healed they take another. There is never enough to eat, their shoes fall to pieces from the marching, their clothes are torn and rotting, and half of them are shitting in their breeches from drinking bad water. “If they want new boots or a warmer cloak or maybe a rusted iron halfhelm, they need to take them from a corpse, and before long they are stealing from the living too, from the smallfolk whose lands they’re fighting in, men very like the men they used to be. They slaughter their sheep and steal their chickens, and from there it’s just a short step to carrying off their daughters too. And one day they look around and realize all their friends and kin are gone, that they are fighting beside strangers beneath a banner that they hardly recognize. They don’t know where they are or how to get back home and the lord they’re fighting for does not know their names, yet here he comes, shouting for them to form up, to make a line with their spears and scythes and sharpened hoes, to stand their ground. And the knights come down on them, faceless men clad all in steel, and the iron thunder of their charge seems to fill the world… “And the man breaks. “He turns and runs, or crawls off afterward over the corpses of the slain, or steals away in the black of night, and he finds someplace to hide. All thought of home is gone by then, and kings and lords and gods mean less to him than a haunch of spoiled meat that will let him live another day, or a skin of bad wine that might drown his fear for a few hours. The broken man lives from day to day, from meal to meal, more beast than man. Lady Brienne is not wrong. In times like these, the traveler must beware of broken men, and fear them…but he should pity them as well.” When Meribald was finished a profound silence fell upon their little band. Brienne could hear the wind rustling through a clump of pussywillows, and farther off the faint cry of a loon. She could hear Dog panting softly as he loped along beside the septon and his donkey, tongue lolling from his mouth. The quiet stretched and stretched, until finally she said, “How old were you when they marched you off to war?” “Why, no older than your boy,” Meribald replied. “Too young for such, in truth, but my brothers were all going, and I would not be left behind. Willam said I could be his squire, though Will was no knight, only a potboy armed with a kitchen knife he’d stolen from the inn. He died upon the Stepstones, and never struck a blow. It was fever did for him, and for my brother Robin. Owen died from a mace that split his head apart, and his friend Jon Pox was hanged for rape.” “The War of the Ninepenny Kings?” asked Hyle Hunt. “So they called it, though I never saw a king, nor earned a penny. It was a war, though. That it was.”"

You don't know if Stannis wins or loses the battle.  I agree with Olly,this was an opportunity to flesh out Edd's character.  Don't pretend Daenerys is more interesting in the books.  I agree with Barristan.  Sansa in Winterfell is a very clever way to merge storylines, and she barely has any content in the books.  ""D&D's writing"" is just reductive, you're already talking about the writing.  Ellaria is part of the SS problem."

The thing is, it's a huge-budget centerpiece for a prime television network, based on brilliant source material, in a genre that has exploded in popularity in the past fifteen years. If GoT wasn't a big a success, that would be a big, unlikely failure for HBO.  And no, it's not the best television ever. We get to criticize it, because it's popular art.   I wish people would stop acting like D&D are victims of some cruel public abuse. Every writer and filmmaker is subject to the same."
asoiaf,3e2a2h,chillybonesjones,2,Tue Jul 21 14:44:33 2015 UTC,"It was a pretty big risk, though. It's a fantasy story that has incest and kills off the main characters. Even for HBO, that's not a story that's guaranteed to work, and I think in the hands of less capable producers and writers the adaptation would have flopped. I agree that the time was right for GoT to get made - we're hitting that post-Harry Potter, post-Lord of the Rings adult fantasy thing. But it wasn't a guaranteed success. I think it only looks that way in hindsight.  I've never said we shouldn't criticize the show. But I do think people shit on D&D for a lot of stupid reasons, and I think a lot of people make it waaaay too personal, saying some shit that's waaaaay over the line. Who out there is actually acting like D&D are victims of some cruel public abuse, by the way?"

He found those people, and decided to let them do it. They aren't ""finishing his legacy."" The books will come out. And it sure as hell ain't ""because money.""  I don't understand how grrm is ""selling out."" Just because he's in a unique position - having the adaptation move faster than him - doesn't make him some sort of cash-grubbing moneylover. If anything, he's clearly the opposite - he could be rushing shitty books out to capitalize on the popularity of the show, but he's not. He still maintains professional relationships with people in the sci-fi fantasy community, and has been using his popularity to publish anthologies that get smaller writers recognized, which is the same way he got started.  GRRM is a lot of things, but some sort of ""sellout"" isn't one of those. Doing even a little bit of research about benioff, weiss, and grrm should show that."

I am grateful for fantasy on television what we have is an extremely water down version which has been destroyed by several poorly written scenes from this season alone. My friends who are show only have told me they didn't like certain scenes and plots and each of them were the fan fiction droll that D&D shoehorned into the show.   I think another writer/producer would of done better. After season 2 the show has turned into a amusement park for D&D ideas of how to make the books better.
asoiaf,3e2a2h,Sorrybuttotallywrong,15,Tue Jul 21 17:08:22 2015 UTC,"The only people who complain about the show are those who have read the books. George set the bar pretty high, and I think the reason the last season wasn't what we wanted is because D&D are now having to improvise a lot of their own material for lack of book plot to use moving forward.   Edit: fixed a word. Show only folks don't complain, at least not in my circle. Only those of us who read the books and know what could have been are the ones to complain. Not a D&D sympathizer, but I am happy to have the show."
asoiaf,3e2a2h,TwoBonesJones,8,Tue Jul 21 14:52:44 2015 UTC,"The only people who complain about the show are those who haven't read the books.   Listen I'm not a D&D basher by any stretch, but to be fair, I don't think this statement is accurate in the slightest. In fact it's probably the direct opposite."
asoiaf,3e2a2h,klhem,12,Tue Jul 21 15:18:50 2015 UTC,"Yup I fucked that up. Show watchers don't complain, book readers do."
asoiaf,3e2a2h,TwoBonesJones,16,Tue Jul 21 16:04:19 2015 UTC,Plenty of people who have read the books and also have not read the books complained about the lack of quality in not just this past season but for seasons before it.

Then who is supposed to win that thing?  If what's left of the Mountain wins, then bringing back the Hound does absolutely nothing except giving him a pointless tacked-on second death.  If the Hound wins, then that is all well and good as far as the brothers are concerned. The slight problem is that it would sentence Cersei to death. One of the original top villains simply executed based on the results of someone else's combat, leaving nobody of interest except Jaime who can't inherit in the Lannister camp? I am not seeing that at all.  Or are they going to pretend that it doesn't count and not execute her after all?"
asoiaf,3e21aq,Roccondil,11,Tue Jul 21 13:44:24 2015 UTC,"The Hound wins, Cersei calls the city watch and the other forces loyal to the crown into a mini war against the sparrows. They win, Cersei tries to destroy the Sept of Baelor, which causes the wildfire to ignite..."
asoiaf,3e21aq,dizigma_,19,Tue Jul 21 15:40:26 2015 UTC,But then Jaime strangles her before she orders it because he knows she knows about the wildfire because he told her about it shortly after killing Aerys.
asoiaf,3e21aq,Alleira,4,Tue Jul 21 17:51:01 2015 UTC,"No, you're absolutely right. Bob Strong is going to win the trial by combat, because otherwise Cersei's story doesn't make much sense. She gets arrested, she gets released on probation and given a magical champion...who is then promptly removed from the story, and she is executed summarily.  Cersei's execution would clean things up in King's Landing. And I don't think that'll happen so easily. No way does TWOW start with Cersei dying. Otherwise, what's the point of GRRM killing off Kevan and Pycelle?"
asoiaf,3e21aq,Bookshelfstud,5,Tue Jul 21 13:54:33 2015 UTC,"I think if she gets sentenced to death she's going to try and take Kings Landing with her. She did have a rather keen interest in wildfire in ACOK. This is my no means an original theory of mine, and it's been tossed around here numerous times, but I like the idea of Jaime killing her before she's able to do it, similar to Aerys."
asoiaf,3e21aq,Roflcopter71,2,Tue Jul 21 16:17:26 2015 UTC,"bringing back the Hound does absolutely nothing except giving him a pointless tacked-on second death   This is my exact objection to Cleganebowl. Even if the Hound survives somehow, he then has to get written out of the story some other way when he is currently in a position of closure and elegantly poised with the ""is he/isn't he dead?"" thing. Most characters would be lucky to leave the story in such a good way. Why would GRRM ruin this at a time when he desperately needs to be closing down characters and sub-plots?"
asoiaf,3e21aq,toilet_brush,0,Tue Jul 21 15:24:13 2015 UTC,I agree. I think his current position is a beautiful peaceful end for him where he has found peace. It would be jarring and criminal to take that away for no other reason than cleganebowl.

I am also a person that gets tired of fake-out deaths in most works, but I enjoy them here because I think it's not so much saving as punishment. As you say, the Hound begged for death, but he was punished to stay in this world that he hates and be reminded day in and day out of the wrongs he's committed, digging his graves. Quentyn was good, and had a clean death, like Arys Oakheart. Oberyn died well, and Ned."
asoiaf,3e21aq,chianine,7,Tue Jul 21 18:57:32 2015 UTC,"Gregor will be revealed, Cersei and Tommen get into some trouble, maybe the hound takes out the zombie with fire or they don't really fight."
asoiaf,3e21aq,alex3omg,3,Tue Jul 21 14:16:01 2015 UTC,"Right. I'm guessing the fight won't go down according to trial-by-combat rules. It'll start that way, Robert/Gregor's helmet will get knocked off, we see Zombie Gregor, Cersei and Qyburn are indicted on necromancy charges.  But Sandor loses his shit when he sees Gregor and wants to end him. The trial is deemed inconsequential but nobody dares to attempt separating the two brothers that are out to kill each other."

Sandor vs. Gregor when both men were at their prime would still be in favor of Gregor IMO.  Sandor vs. Gregor NOW!?!?!?!  Sandor is a one legged gravekeeper who hasn't trained in months or possibly over a year by now.

Just think of Lady Stoneheart as the Caitlyn Jenner of Westeros and you'll understand my position.

asoiaf,3e21aq,Theweirdfox,19,Tue Jul 21 13:29:33 2015 UTC,"I'm taking it on a case by case basis. Beric obviously held on to more of himself than Catelyn did but he himself thought he was changed and lost much of himself.     Can I dwell on what I scarce remember? I held a castle on the Marches once, and there was a woman I was pledged to marry, but I could not find that castle today, nor tell you the color of that woman's hair. Who knighted me, old friend? What were my favorite foods? It all fades. Sometimes I think I was born on the bloody grass in that grove of ash, with the taste of fire in my mouth and a hole in my chest. Are you my mother, Thoros?     Catelyn Stark is far more gone though and doesn't exist any more in any proper sense. LSH has consumed her."

Sure, Robert Strong is technically Gregor Clegane brought back from the brink of death, but if there's not much left of the man there (especially if he really doesn't have a head), then would it truly be cathartic for Sandor to finally take him out?

asoiaf,3e21aq,ciobanica,4,Tue Jul 21 13:26:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but I think that makes Cleganebowl even cooler...  Whereas before Sandor wanted to kill him for personal reasons, now he will want to kill him out of duty because UnGregor is a threat to the peace that his new-found institution seeks to maintain.

asoiaf,3e21aq,mysticalmisogynistic,4,Tue Jul 21 13:34:09 2015 UTC,"I think Cleganebowl CLEGANEBOWL will happen but not at Cercie's trial. If Sandor wins, then Cercie's story has a really awkward ending. If he loses, then his time on the Quiet Isle meant nothing and his new death serves no purpose.  I think The Bowl That Was Promised will happen later, and at the trial Un-Gregor will wipe the floor with whoever the faith sends to fight him(possibly Lancel). This serves to build up the fight by showing the readers just how scary and powerful Un-Gregor is while allowing for the possibility of showing any of his new weaknesses (being undead) in the fight. How lame would it be if Sandor shows up and just automatically knows how to beat him?   If When this fight goes down it will need to have some serious build up and foreshadowing of how Sandor can win. One possibility already exists. We know wights are vulnerable to fire, but we don't know if the same applies to Quyburn's particular brand of resurrection. If it does, this would require Sandor to conquer his two biggest fears (fire and his cunt of a brother) to be victorious. This would provide some pretty cool closure that I feel ASOIAF kind of lacks right now.  If Un-Gregor ISNT vulnerable to regular fire, then we will need to have some time in the books to figure out just how to take this monster down (and also to get word to Sandor about his brother and convince him to come out of retirement to fight him).  That being said, the show being super hungry for shock factor(remember Sansa'a rape scene that served no purpose) will more than likely do CLEGANEBOWL at the trial."

Ned escaped into the country, disheartened and half the man that he was.   Friends nowhere to be found during the chaos of the ensuing war that followed his fake death, Ned stumbled across a down on her luck milk maid trying to start up her own farm.   Using his knowledge of Kingdom finance and management, Ned helped the milkmaid make her dream a reality. Under the pseudonym ""creamy Ned"", the farm went from strength to strength.   In honour of her selfless patron the milkmaid named her farm ""Ned's creamery"", and it became known as the crowning teet of Westeros.   That milkmaid? Euron Benjen  McDaario.   Edit: a thing."

asoiaf,3dykex,BeautifulMania,11,Tue Jul 21 12:54:00 2015 UTC,"A solid theory, but this is still the one I'm betting on:  After Ned warged into Ice, the sword was melted down and forged into two separate blades. One representing Dark Ned, the other Light Ned. These represent the conflicting sides of Ned's personality.  Jaime gave Light Ned to Brienne, who as we all know is now working for LSH. After Jaime kills Brienne or vice versa, UnCat will claim Light Ned for her own. Then, after a sudden wave of motherly guilt she will take the blade to UnJon as reparation for years of mistreatment. The bitterness they could not reconcile in life they will reconcile in undeath.  After Dany, Euron and Grey Worm then land in Westeros and burn King's Landing to the ground, Dany will find Dark Ned beside Joffrey's corpse where it was left.  The final battle of course, will be Jon vs Dany (they're both on the cover of the HBO box set), with Jon wielding Light Ned, and Dany wielding Dark Ned.  That's when we find out the entire premise of the series is Ned struggling against the conflicting natures of his own heart, and trying to overcome this internal struggle via a lengthy metaphor about seven kingdoms or some shit."

They were both on the Wall at the same time, though I believe he was a Shadow Tower man, hence why Benjen wouldn't have recognized them from the time they were both on the Wall."

We were skinning it when the smell of blood drew a shadowcat out of its lair. I drove it off, but not before it shredded my cloak to ribbons. Do you see? Here, here, and here?” He chuckled. “It shredded my arm and back as well, and I bled worse than the elk. My brothers feared I might die before they got me back to Maester Mullin at the Shadow Tower, so they carried me to a wildling village where we knew an old wisewoman did some healing. She was dead, as it happened, but her daughter saw to me. Cleaned my wounds, sewed me up, and fed me porridge and potions until I was strong enough to ride again. And she sewed up the rents in my cloak as well, with some scarlet silk from Asshai that her grandmother had pulled from the wreck of a cog washed up on the Frozen Shore. It was the greatest treasure she had, and her gift to me.” He swept the cloak back over his shoulders. “But at the Shadow Tower, I was given a new wool cloak from stores, black and black, and trimmed with black, to go with my black breeches and black boots, my black doublet and black mail. The new cloak had no frays nor rips nor tears... and most of all, no red. The men of the Night’s Watch dressed in black, Ser Denys Mallister reminded me sternly, as if I had forgotten. My old cloak was fit for burning now, he said.” “I left the next morning... for a place where a kiss was not a crime, and a man could wear any cloak he chose.” (Jon I, ASoS)"
asoiaf,3dykex,E-Nezzer,4,Mon Jul 20 19:04:40 2015 UTC,"That prompts an interesting difference in his interaction with Mance between the book and the show...at least interesting to me.            In the show, there is no indication (as far as I know) of Mance Rayder being at Winterfell during the feast. As such, when it comes to asking Jon why he wants to join them, Jon has to formulate the clever half-truth about Mormont being okay with Craster's sacrifices and wanting to fight for the side of the living.              But in the book, Mance sharing his presence at the Winterfell feast gives Jon his story. The excerpt here:             Jon took another swallow of mead. There is only one tale that he might believe. ""You say you were at Winterfell, the night my father feasted King Robert."" ""I did say it, for I was."" ""Then you saw us all. Prince Joffrey and Prince Tommen, Princess Myrcella, my brothers Robb and Bran and Rickon, my sisters Arya and Sansa. You saw them walk the center aisle with every eye upon them and take their seats at the table just below the dais where the king and queen were seated."" ""I remember."" ""And did you see where I was seated, Mance?"" He leaned forward. ""Did you see where they put the bastard?"" Mance Rayder looked at Jon's face for a long moment. ""I think we had best find you a new cloak,"" the king said, holding out his hand."
asoiaf,3dykex,reversewolverine,3,Mon Jul 20 19:54:01 2015 UTC,"Mance Rayder, Kar Jaqer, Hals Bergler, Benq Robbard and Horst Theef were the closest group of friends that ever existed in the lands beyond the Wall. Mance and Hals had similar hobbies, just like Kar and Horst, while Benq shared nothing in common with his pals, with his dreams of one day sailing to Braavos and pulling the biggest heist in the history of Planetos. He counted on his friends to assist him with such a great achievement, but they preferred simpler lives with no dreams of grand wealth, except for Mance, who dreamed of having a big house.   As time passed, the group slowly divided itself into two smaller groups, with Benq standing alone. Jobless and poor, he felt he had no choice but to embark on his journey on his own, relying only on his wits and his fighting prowess. Playing the long game, Benq joined the service of the Sealord of Braavos under the name of Syrio Forel and spent years earning the trust of his liege, taking some lessons with the Faceless Men when off-duty. While protecting a random girl on an away mission, he faked his own death and changed his identity to Jaqen H'gar, infiltrating several Braavosi intitutions. Now he is just one step from robbing the great Iron Bank of Braavos.  Meanwhile in Westeros, an old enemy was about to return: the Others. The time for petty crime was over, as hordes of real ice zombies started to destroy entire communities. While Mance and Hals decided to fight back, Kar and Horst were among the first to flee south, but they didn't last long, getting themselves killed while trying to steal a horse from a crippled child. Mance married Hals' sister, Dalla, to cement an alliance between their tribes to help unite the Free Folk. Alas, the truest of all these friendships was put to an end when Hals, on a mission of diplomacy, was betrayed and murdered by the Cave People, who broke the sacred law of Guest Right, earning the hatred of the entire Free Folk and making Mance furious. However, Mance was merciful and accepted the Cave People into his army despite their treachery. The Free Folk was now ready to march on the Wall."

There was a part somewhere where some history was being spoken of and how I think it was Elia was supposed to marry some guy and she was actually really attracted to him. But then he farted and she couldn't stop laughing at him. And so she married Rhaegar.   I remember thinking.... Did.... It all began... with a fart?

Prince Oberyn asked, as the Bastard of Godsgrace knelt before him to fasten his greaves. ""It was not for your tail alone that my sister and I came to Casterly Rock. We were on a quest of sorts. A quest that took us to Starfall, the Arbor, Oldtown, the Shield Islands, Crakehall, and finally Casterly Rock . . . but our true destination was marriage. Doran was betrothed to Lady Mellario of Norvos, so he had been left behind as castellan of Sunspear. My sister and I were yet unpromised.  ""Elia found it all exciting. She was of that age, and her delicate health had never permitted her much travel. I preferred to amuse myself by mocking my sister's suitors. There was Little Lord Lazyeye, Squire Squishlips, one I named the Whale That Walks, that sort of thing. The only one who was even halfway presentable was young Baelor Hightower. A pretty lad, and my sister was half in love with him until he had the misfortune to fart once in our presence. I promptly named him BaelorBreakwind, and after that Elia couldn't look at him without laughing. I was a monstrous young fellow, someone should have sliced out my vile tongue.""  Yes, Tyrion agreed silently. Baelor Hightower was no longer young, but he remained Lord Leyton's heir; wealthy, handsome, and a knight of splendid repute. Baelor Brightsmile, they called him now. Had Elia wed him in place of Rhaegar Targaryen, she might be in Oldtown with her children growing tall around her. He wondered how many lives had been snuffed out by that fart.   Baelor Breakwind is a great name, btw."

The NW is The Horn if Joramun, and they will bring down The Wall themselves. Perhaps by hand. This will remove a very large barrier to sunlight reaching the Land of Always Winter. Once removed, the White Walkers will all scream and melt, á la The Wicked Witch of The West and all movie vampires. Sam is Lightbringer, because he will organize the whole wall-smashing.

I highly disagree. On the first read one does not put all of those factors together. Thus Tywin's arrival was still surprising and very unexpected. Also, on the show i haven't met a single person who expected Tywin's arrival either. Most forgot about him as he was gone for several episodes.  Things like messages to Robs camp from the battle are ""nice to haves"" and not ""must haves"".

I'm really impressed by how you picked out these very small lines about timing - the N&C/L&J marriage happening after the Battle of the Bells, for instance. That GRRM quote on Jon's birth really gives this some backbone. I mean, for one thing, it tells us that GRRM is thinking about this stuff and the relative timing of it all. For another thing - well, as you proved, there's a lot to be gleaned from just that small quote.  Overall friggin awesome."

asoiaf,3dz1b2,Sorrybuttotallywrong,10,Mon Jul 20 19:58:50 2015 UTC,"Awesome, nice work!  This raises a question that's been niggling at me for a while, since someone else mentioned that Aegon was probably born after Harrenhal. Why did Rhaegar crown Lyanna when Elia hadn't yet been told she couldn't have any more children?  Also, evidence for Aegon being fake. It looks like he had to be at least a year old for the sack of King's Landing - pretty tough to confuse with a newborn."
asoiaf,3dz1b2,LadyVolpont,15,Mon Jul 20 20:36:04 2015 UTC,"My theory is that Rhaegar discovered that Lyanna was the Knight of the Laughing Tree and crowned her for her achievement at the tourney. That way, no one would know she was the KotLT and she would be premied anyway. Elia knew this.  Rhaegar didn't fall in love with her until he abducted her. Maybe he spoke with Elia that he needed another child for his prophecy to come true, and then Elia could have suggested to take ""that northern girl you crowned at Harrenhal"""
asoiaf,3dz1b2,Sorrybuttotallywrong,8,Mon Jul 20 21:01:11 2015 UTC,Trying to read this gorgeous data but in trying to understand where you put Rheagar being summoned to KL to raise an army. After the battle of the bells it seems Rheagar was summoned back but Ned only married cat after the battle of the bells. If Rheagar was summoned and left immediately then wouldn't that affect the concenption idea of Jon or did you take that into account when figuring out all of that? I don't believed Rheagar would of left Lyanna without making sure she was pregnant due to the prophesy so that should be calculated in the data as well for when Rheagar left.   Good catch about when Jon is born. I never thought Lyanna died during childbirth but as a result of complications which is why the KG couldn't flee ToJ because the Queen and young Prince could not flee.
asoiaf,3dz1b2,Sorrybuttotallywrong,7,Mon Jul 20 20:43:19 2015 UTC,"Between Ned riding off to war (4) and the Battle of the Trident (5) that Rhaegar took part, there is an astonishing 8 months and a week minimum and 10 months and 3 weeks maximum that we know nearly nothing about.  That is enought time to make a child, see that Lyanna is pregnant, and then go and train an army.  For me, my biggest question is the time between Lyanna's abduction (-2) and Jon's conception (J'c).  There are nearly 6 months minimum (From 01/04/282 to 24/09/282, assuming that when Bran fell off the tower was at 08/05/298).  That is 6 months minimum where Lyanna could have got pregnant. Didn't they success to make a child until 6 months after the abduction? Did Lyanna first had a miscarriage?  Did they have an adventure during that 6 months where they, at first discussed because Rhaegar abducted her, and then, slowly, began to fall in love for each other?"
asoiaf,3dz1b2,Sorrybuttotallywrong,6,Mon Jul 20 20:58:33 2015 UTC,"For me, my biggest question is the time between Lyanna's abduction (-2) and Jon's conception (J'c).   Ever since I read TWOIAF, and its cryptic wording ""not ten leagues from Harrenhal … where Rhaegar would once again come face-to-face with Lyanna Stark"", I've wondered if they met by chance at the Crossroads Inn, where so many game-changing chance meetings have occurred. It could be that their reasons for being there and for heading south together had more to do with politics than romance. For all we know, they were trying their hardest not to fall in love."
asoiaf,3dz1b2,Sorrybuttotallywrong,2,Mon Jul 20 22:19:58 2015 UTC,"Maybe. What I think is that Brandon, Rickard and Lyanna were going to B&C's wedding, but then, however it happened, Rhaegar found Lyanna and ""abducted"" her. With or without consent.  Edit: this not meant rape, they would not have sex until they were in love.  Maybe it was without consent, and they discuss in their ride to the south. Then Rhaegar explained her prophecy to her, and then, with contacts and little trivial discussions over the road, they slowly began to fall in love with each other."
asoiaf,3dz1b2,Sorrybuttotallywrong,4,Mon Jul 20 23:28:21 2015 UTC,According to Jaime after the battle of the bells is when Rheagar is called from the south. Presumably because he also realized the danger of the rebels and agreed that he needed to come back to save the realm from Robert's fury.   The question I have is when that happened. Did it happen immediately after the battle of the bells? Even if it was within a month or so Lyanna must of already been assuredly pregnant unless Rheagar waited months after the battle of the bells to go to KL and meet at the trident. He had to raise an army and that takes time. It seems that between the battle of the bells and the trident there is a good chunk of time. Perhaps Barry B and army tried to hold back to rebels and fell back towards the trident where Rheagar decided to not try and do a siege of KL given how his father was?  Jon could of looked small if he was premature. This could explain why Lyanna was not well because she had complications from the pregnancy causing her to deliver Jon early. Though speculating because trying to find an ezplaination of how Jon can fit into being 'young' as Robb.
asoiaf,3dz1b2,Farmerj0hn,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:56:29 2015 UTC,"I don't think that Rhaegar went to KL right after the Battle fo the Bells. More like 3, 4 months or so after it.  With my assumptions, Jon was conceived from 2 weeks to 3 months after N&C's wedding, that was maybe a week (""hastily arranged"") after the Battle of the Bells.  if Jon was premature, It could be no more than 8 months or so, because this is westeros, like the middle ages, there are no incubators. That would decrease a little the distance between (4) and (5), but 7 months is still a lot.  Also, from westeros.org wiki, the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, Ser Gerold Hightower, was send by King Aerys to find Rhaegar, so he could take months to find Rhaegar.  The reference of it is from George R. R. Martin's A World of Ice and Fire. The reason I didn't include it was because I couldn't check it myself"
asoiaf,3dz1b2,Coriniel,2,Mon Jul 20 23:19:44 2015 UTC,"Btw no disrespect to your amazing work. I just see some small holes in your data, imo"
asoiaf,3dz1b2,CptAustus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:57:35 2015 UTC,Don't worry!  I like that this is being discussed. It helps to see the flaws and the strengh of the assumptions :)
asoiaf,3dz1b2,yeahgreg,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:14:45 2015 UTC,Why would it take months to find Rheagar? Hightower most likely knew where Rheagar was. Other people just didn't know. Aerys wasn't told because Rheagar I feel was concerned of how he would treat Lyanna given how he treated Elia.   So from textual evidence we do not know how long it took Rheagar to return from the south. Between the Battle of the Bells and the Battle for the Trident happened in the same year (from the wiki. Where do you get that the battle of the bells happened in 282? - if it's based on the name days and you said there could be leeway then it might be different)  So my question is that is it realistic to think that It took months for Rheagar to return to KL and then raise together a force and then he went to the trident to fight and die all in the same year? I don't know if that amount of events could happen like that.
asoiaf,3dz1b2,CptAustus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:47:07 2015 UTC,"Hightower was in KL, we don't know if he knew exactly where Rhaegar was. Maybe he did know that he was in the south, and he did know that all the Lyanna stuff, but he didn't know where exactly find Rhaegar. Like I said, I could not check the source.  Yes, from textual evidence, we do not know how long it took Rhaegar to return from the south. We can only speculate.  I only could assume that between the the Battle of the Bells (2) and the Battle of the Trident (5), there is nearly 9 months minimum (A week, a fortnight and 8.25 months) assuming Jon was not premature.  I am entirely sure that the Battle of the Bells happened in 282 and it was not in the same year that the Battle of the Trident in 283. That is because:   The maximum date of Robb's conception is at 08/11/282, right before Ned rode off to war, scarcely a fortnight of his wedding. Any more than that, it is highly unlikely and unrealistic.   and from the precise name days' relationship essay:   I haven’t find a reference in the books stating that Ned and Catelyn’s wedding happened in 283. The Battle of the Bells, which takes place really close to Catelyn and Ned’s wedding, is stated to happen in early 283, without references, in the westeros wiki:   A Wiki of Ice and Fire - Battle of the Bells  A Wiki of Ice and Fire - Robert's Rebellion  I think that assumption was made because of the following quote:  A Dance with Dragons - The Lost Lord:   Seventeen years had come and gone since the Battle of the Bells, yet the sound of bells ringing still tied a knot in his guts.   That happens in the year 300AC.    300 - 17 = 283.  Right? But…  Imagine that it is 1st of May of year 300 (this date is just an example).  Now, you remember that 17 years ago happened the Battle of the Bells. That means that the Battle happened in:  a) Before May of 283: The 17th anniversary of the Battle happened already in that year. (The Wiki and most timelines assumption).  b) After May of 282. The 18th anniversary of the Battle has not  happened yet, but will happen in that year. (My assumption).  c) Right at 1st of May of 283 and therefore, it is the 17th anniversary of the Battle.  So, depending of the date of the year Jon Connignton thinks about the Battle (some month of spring I think), the Battle of the Bells and N&C’s wedding could have happened in 282 after that date or 283 before that date at the very last.  So, yes, it is realistic to think that Rhaegar took months after the Battle of the Bells to return to KL after he was sure Lyanna was pregnant, had time to raise an army, and then die in the Battle of the Trident, but The Battle of the Bells and the Trident can not be in the same year."
asoiaf,3dz1b2,HenkWaterlander,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:11:47 2015 UTC,To your last point: If the rebel threat was real and that Aegon was perhaps in danger due to it does it make sense that Rheagar wouldn't hurry to KL?  If no one knew where Rheagar had gone how could Hightower know where to go? He either went to starfall then or he knew exactly where to go. Rheagar wouldn't be advertising where he was if he was keeping Lyanna safe.   If he took 4 months to go to KL then Jon must of been a premie and died in childbirth. If Rheagar took two months then he could of been conceived around same Jon. If he took a month then I think Jon was conceived and Lyanna gave birth late which can happen in problematic pregnancies. What do you think?
asoiaf,3dz1b2,chillybonesjones,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:10:24 2015 UTC,"For the safety of Elia, Aegon and the other royal members of the Targaryens there were already the other members of the Kingsguard, Barristan Selmy, Jonothor Darry and Jaime Lannister. And the Gold cloaks of KL.   I didn't say that no one knew where Rhaegar had gone, but that doesn't mean that they knew EXACTLY where he was. Maybe they had a roughly idea, and then Hightower spent some time fo find the EXACT place.  I didn't fully understand your last point. Let me explain my point:  I don't know exactly when Rhaegar returned from the south to prepare an army. But I will speculate that it was around 3, 4, 5 months or so after the Battle of the Bells.  Here are my assumptions:   Between the Battle of the Bells to the Trident there are minimum 9 months (a week to N&C's weeding + a fortnight to Ned returning to war + 8.25 months minimum between that and the Trident) Jon Snow's conception is 3 months maximum after N&C's wedding. Rhaegar and Lyanna had sex and concieved Jon in that interval of time. Maybe they had sex before, but Jon was not conceived until that interval of time. 3 months after N&C's wedding, Jon was already conceived, and there is still 5 months until the Battle of the Trident. That is enought time to see that Lyanna is pregnant, then go to KL to train an army knowing that Lyanna is pregnant, and finally go to the battle of the Bells which resulted in the death of Rhaegar. 3 weeks maximum after the Battle of the Trident, Jon Snow was born"
asoiaf,3dz1b2,dios_Achilleus,2,Tue Jul 21 16:44:18 2015 UTC,"My last point was on when Jon was conceived and when he was born and how far along Lyanna was.   Are you basing when the trident and the bells happened based on Cat speaking her inner monologue concerning Ned still warring after 9 months?  I don't think it means that the trident happened then. It can be speculated by to Cat, Ned could of been 'warring' in the south until he sent a letter to riverrun or sent an escort of northern men and lords to being cat safely to Winterfell. As with Jon, Eddard wouldn't waste time and would be sending him as fast as possible along with lyanna's body so Robert wouldn't figure out what happened. That's why the rest were buried at ToJ I believe - to not cause the silent sisters to work on the bodies and to not allow Robert time to issue a royal order to prevent Lyanna being brought to Winterfell.   For arguments sake since you are using the wiki for some of your facts then let's go with that the wiki is correct with  283 for both the Bells and the Trident. So the following needed to happen all in one year:  Battle of the Bells Marriage of the Tully sisters Hightower sent after Rheagar Lyanna being pregant enough for Rheagar to leave her Rheagar coming north Dornish spearman marching the kingsroad Rheagar raising a host  The battle at the trident  queen and Viserys sent away KL sacked Storms end siege lifted Lyanna dying at tower of joy along with all fighters except Ned and Howland  And all the army movements. The wiki page with the battle of the trident gives a good map of the potential army movements and the battles they had.   I feel like your timeline fits if the bells was in 282 but I feel the wiki is correct that it was 283. If there were only two battles during 283 then why would it take so long to do them?"
asoiaf,3dz1b2,yeahgreg,2,Tue Jul 21 17:57:16 2015 UTC,"Are you basing when the trident and the bells happened based on Cat speaking her inner monologue concerning Ned still warring after 9 months?   No. Have you seen the assumptions and calculations? I'm basing when the Battle of the Trident took place in:   [1-7]: The duration of the Siege of Storm's End [1-3]: The duration between the beginning of the SSE and N&C's wedding [1-4]: Ned rode off to war a fortnight after his wedding. In this time happened Robb's conception Jon is believed by Catelyn and Robert to have been conceived after N&C's wedding when Ned was in the south. There is 3 months maximum between Robb and Jon's conceptions. [D'c-5]: The time between Dany's conception and the Battle of the Trident: A week. [5-6]: The time between the Battle of the Trident to the Sack of KL: A week. [6-7]: The time between the Sack of KL and the end of the SSE: A week. [7-J'b]: The time between the end of the SSE and Jon Snow's birth: A week maximum. -3 weeks minimum.   Therefore, the interval [4-5] is: [1-7] less ( [1-3] + [1-4] + [5-6] + [6-7] ). My calculations says that it is 8.25 months minimum and 10.75 months maximum.   For arguments sake since you are using the wiki for some of your facts then let's go with that the wiki is correct with 283 for both the Bells and the Trident. So the following needed to happen all in one year:   No, I didn't use the wiki for my assumptions. I use the quotes of the book. The wiki helped me to find the quotes.  Also, about N&C's wedding and the Battle of the Bells, the wiki is wrong. And I have already proved it. The Battle of the Bells happened in 282.   The wiki says that it happened in 283 bacause it is based in this assumption:  Battle of the Bells  I have already explained why it is wrong.   Battle of the Bells --> Marriage of the Tully sisters --> Hightower sent after Rheagar --> Lyanna being pregant enough for Rheagar to leave her --> Rheagar coming north --> Dornish spearman marching the kingsroad --> Rheagar raising a host --> The battle at the trident --> queen and Viserys sent away KL sacked --> Storms end siege lifted --> Lyanna dying at tower of joy along with all fighters except Ned and Howland   That order is totally correct.   I feel like your timeline fits if the bells was in 282 but I feel the wiki is correct that it was 283. If there were only two battles during 283 then why would it take so long to do them?   It took so long because Jon Snow's conception was between N&C's wedding and 3 months maximum after the wedding, and Jon's birthday is maximum 3 weeks after the Battle of the Trident. I'm assuming Jon is born 9 months after he was conceived. This is westeros, there are no incubators. If he was premature, I could not be more than 1 month. And 7 months from (4) to (5) is still a lot. That doesn't change anything.  I think I have been clear enough"

I always think: Hey Rhaegar, what have you been doing for the last year, as people were dying by the thousands, in a war that you apparently know to be just and which was the immediate result of your actions? And why are you now riding off to fight on the wrong side?!? You're saying, after one more battle, during which you plan to defeat the people fighting for justice, you will then call a counsel to set the realm to rights?

Plus I don't think it'll be a completely sudden occurrence. I could see another war / power struggle breaking out after the murder of Kevan Lannister, seeing as Tommen is only a child and still not fit to rule.

Sam discovers ancient texts detailing how to fight the Others and the locations of several rich seams of dragonglass. The King/Queen sends all available forces North to halt the incoming invasion, and throws as many resources as possible at producing dragonglass weapons. Everywhere, everyone is busy preparing for the last campaign.   And then, nothing. Winter solidifies it's grip on the world, the Long Night settles in. Snow piles up hundreds of feet in the Riverlands. Everywhere soldiers freeze and starve while manning strategically important castles and hold fasts. Two years go by, still no sign of the Others. No scouts that pass into the Gift return. Five years pass, the King/Queen starts to think the Others have no desire to pass south of the Gift, the scouts must have succumbed to the cold. Nine years pass. The food stores are nearly gone. Westero's armies have long since dissolved into the driving snow, it's now a fight for even great lords to feed their families. Thousands flee to Dorne, meager crops are scrounged from the cold sands.   Then one by one hold fasts and keeps stop sending ravens. The snows are too deep for riders. Slowly the deafening silence reaches Winterfel, then The Eyrie, Casterly Rock, Kings Landing. Then one day the King/Queen receives an urgent message at their new seat in Sunspear. The Others have overrun the garrison in the Boneway.   tl;dr: The Wall falls, the Others use winter as a siege weapon, starving Westeros into submission."

Their army grew exponentially as they marched and more than half of the continent is undead.  The remaining Lannisters and other major houses have fled to Dorne, the last hold out, while The Others corner them and move in for the kill.    Dany will decide she can no longer wait to go to Westeros because if she doesn't save it, there will be no throne to sit upon.  Jon Targeryan will have come to her and made her believe the madness that is lose on the land.  She will come in through the Blackwater somewhat behind the White Walker army's march.  She will fly upon Drogon above the empty city of King's Landing and land in the shattered and frozen remains of the Red Keep.

In my headcanon, he went to Dorne to rebuild his alliance with Doran Martell, seriously threatened by his silly games at Harrenhal. He might have offered to betroth little Rhaenys to little Quentyn to make sure the Martells were fully shackled to the Targaryens. Maybe he also went to Oldtown to find a maester to cure his ailing wife and the delicate (?) son she had just given birth to. On his way down south he took a detour to the Riverlands and bumped into the irresistibly cute runaway bride Lyanna Stark, who reported to him her fears about her father's support for Robert Baratheon, which seemed to have taken on a new purpose after Harrenhal. He decided to take her south for her own safety and lodge her in a remote hideaway not too far from his friends the Daynes. When he heard terrible news about events in KL, his first thought was to go to Lyanna and make amends. One thing led to another ...   That's probably enough to keep him busy in the south for six months or so."

I meant to do it long ago, but . . . well, it does no good to speak of roads not taken. We shall talk when I return.""  Those were the last words Rhaegar Targaryen ever spoke to him. Outside the gates an army had assembled, whilst another descended on the Trident. So the Prince of Dragonstone mounted up and donned his tall black helm, and rode forth to his doom.

asoiaf,3e0lrs,lemongorgonzola,3,Tue Jul 21 14:22:03 2015 UTC,"""Favorite theory"" is a stretch. More like most commonly believed theory. There are a lot of things about the theory that are make it dislikable. Such as it being pretty cliche unless GRRM gives us an unexpected twist. The outcast boy finding out he is actually a prince is fantasy trope 101.   The bitter sweet ending that GRRM promised us gives me hope that this will be handled well."
asoiaf,3e0lrs,Azor_ash_hi,9,Tue Jul 21 05:06:19 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think it's refreshing.  The whole series is full of twists and anti-cliche.  I'm 100% fine with Rhaegar chasing after Lyanna and then falling in love with her, and then Lyanna loving him back while they both dreamed of their little prince to be promised/third dragon head and life together after they took down the King (which I'm assuming Lyanna would be 100% okay with after what happened to her bro and dad).  Only to have all their hopes and dreams end on a battlefield and then Lyanna dying before she could even see her song grow.    I just really want this to not involve rape.  Mainly because I can't imagine how terrible it would've been for Lyanna and I would feel bad about Jon knowing he was the product of brutal and repeated rape.    What would be cliche and I hope doesn't happen with all of my heart is Dany and Jon ending up together on the throne.  Don't mind if it's a  brief romance, but anything extended would remind me of fanfiction.  I shiver every time I read a theory hinting towards it."

asoiaf,3e0lrs,Azor_ash_hi,0,Tue Jul 21 11:35:08 2015 UTC,"I think it would be funny if both Dan and Jon (who are both legitimate heirs to the throne, if R+L=J) the war and Aegon claimed the throne, and it turns out that Aegon isn't really Aegon, but a pretender.  That would be the GRRM thing to do.  The bittersweet could be that Jon gets Winterfell.  Also, I think Dany might be dying from the Pale mare. (Symptoms of the bloody flux are:high fever, intestinal hemorrhaging and diarrhea)  Another fun idea is that she may be going mad. I was just reading about how she is an unreliable narrator, and some of the things she says are pretty wrong, like she remembers events slightly incorrectly. (like she never gets sick, or once she got burned but in a later chapter remembered not getting burned specifically).  It would be pretty cool if she and Jon took the iron throne, but she went mad."

He gave a lot of back and forth page counts and estimates on ADWD, and people gave him flack for it--he'd originally estimated that it would come out in 2006, and it wasn't released until mid-2011. In between there was a lot of noise, including times when the page count would drop as he got rid of or rewrote stuff. So following all that, he's simply decided on a ""no more comments"" approach, and that it'll be done when it's done. This hasn't exactly reassured people, since now there's not even a vague progress indicator.   We do know a few things. He only works from his home office in Santa Fe, so any time he's traveling he isn't writing. He also isn't necessarily writing every day he's home. He didn't restart work on book 6 until the beginning of 2012. He's said that it definitely will not come out this year. He's also said he would like to beat season 6 of the show to the punch, so he at least thinks it's plausible to have it out before April of 2016--but as most people here will tell you, GRRM tends to be overly optimistic about his deadlines.

I'd probably replace Gugu Mbatha-Raw with Catalina Sandino Moreno for the role of Elia.  Also, I don't like the placement of Martin Freeman as Howland Reed, just because he's too old, but I don't have a better alternative in mind."

Too bad it's unlikely since Penny Dreadful must shoot at the same time. He's absolutely fantastic in that though so I guess it's okay"

asoiaf,3e0sar,HumbleBarbarian,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:29:23 2015 UTC,I like that fan casting. Though I'd just replace Tom Hardy with pretty much anyone
asoiaf,3e0sar,Lepmik,0,Tue Jul 21 04:25:33 2015 UTC,"You get my upvote for replacing Tom Hardy. I really don't get why half of the asoiaf/got fanbase is swooning for him to play a role in the show. A very good actor but he just doesn't have the appearance for playing anything historical, in my opinion. Would feel just like seeing Kiefer Sutherland play a roman in Pompeii, just not a good fit for the depicted time.   Pretty great casting choices overall though. His Rhaegar looks good especially regarding Kit Harington, though I'd still prefer Paul Bettany."

asoiaf,3e0sar,hybbprqag,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:50:42 2015 UTC,"This is really the only choice. A+++. Rhaegar should be lean, have a mellifluous voice, speak a dozen languages, be courtly, sensitive, capable of brooding, but also teasing and genuinely being delighted by her KotLT gig. TH fits the bill perfectly. I mean, he actually IS those things, and has the greatest smile in the business besides.  For Lyanna, Gemma Arterton."
asoiaf,3e0sar,turnip_juice,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:13:21 2015 UTC,"If TH was cast, I could honestly die happy. I'd also take Jonathan Rhys Meyers... Now that I'm at a computer I can give my rest:  Lyanna: Rachel Weisz - A younger one, think circa The Mummy. Resembles Maisie!  Young Ned: James McAvoy  Elia Martell: Alicia Vikander  Dayne: Ben Barnes  Reed: Elijah Wood - Hear me out: Isn't Reed described as ""small?"" Plus he could totally be show-Jojen's dad."
asoiaf,3e0sar,scarsAndFlames,3,Tue Jul 21 13:53:44 2015 UTC,"JRM...doesn't have the romantic charisma. Also, vague fetal alcohol syndrome look isn't working for me.  I like young RW for Lyanna. She isn't too petite (or she couldn't show up men at the tourney like she did), is brunette, and can be Magnificent.   I like Vikander for the physical contrast to a more robust Lyanna. Vikander looks like the kind of woman who would struggle to give birth and whose physicians would warn her husband to quit banging lest he impregnate her again and kill her. I see the Maisie resemblance, and also see it in Gemma Arterton, which is one reason I picked her. I think RW has the advantage on the eyes, though...lighter than GA.  And yes, Howland Reed is small, which is why the squires are picking on him when Lyanna intervenes. This is another reason I think Lyanna must be tall. Not bigger than a tall guy, but bigger than HR."

That episode was the best story telling you could ask for to cover such a complicated battle, Especially since its clear such a battle is far out of the scope of the shows.   It made me feel like I was watching Horrible Histories because its presented to be both memorable and entertaining. I have a much better understanding of the battle now, even though I've read all Brydens essays, the information sticks when its presented like this, I never considered just how much of the army was actually a slave contingent and likely wanting to change loyalty instead of be slaughtered. It remains to be seen how many of these slaves turn on their masters and sellsword companies.    The reading of Ser Barristons battle speech gave me chills. Barriston the Bold, Barry with balls of steel.   You are doing an amazing job. Its a great time to be a fan of ASOIAF with people producing content like this."
