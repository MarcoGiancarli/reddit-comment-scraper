ShitWehraboosSay,3e507q,elos_,13,Wed Jul 22 00:24:28 2015 UTC,"KurtGodel7 is basically arguing that the Allies were the bad guys   no shit  EDIT: I'm bored so I'll do a point by point rebuttal   Before WW2 started, the Soviets had murdered more people than the Germans (e.g, the Ukraine famine).   This is three whole different flavors of bullshit.   a) The Ukraine famine was a natural disaster, and one that happened often enough in Tsarist Russia. The worst you could realistically pin on the Soviets is that their policies made it worse. This is like citing traffic statistics and claiming the Obama administration has murdered more Americans than ISIS has.   b) Why is he limiting the numbers to pre-war? If you're gonna talk about who wins the Genocide Olympics you don't stop at the preliminary rounds.  c) The Nazis ran actual death camps to annihilate entire human ethnicities. Whatever you think about the Soviets, they look like the Care Bears compared to the literal empire of evil that was Nazi Germany.   A lot the Allies (UK, France, US, Czechoslovakia) were friendly to the Soviets, who were planning to conquer Germany.   I seem to recall Germany cozying up to the Soviets in the runup to the war and Poland being distinctly unfriendly towards the Soviets. The various pro-Soviet countries might even have valid reason for being so, like self-defense against this crazy German murder cult that somehow came into power.  As far as ""planned to conquer Germany"" goes, there's a huge difference between jotting down some ideas in just in case and actually, you know, attempting to conquer the Soviet Union.   Poland had an anti-German foreign policy, edged on by false promises from the Entente (who didn't attack Germany after declaring war and didn't even declare war on Russia after she also invaded Poland). Poland also desired German territory, including East Prussia.   There's a good reason Poland had an anti-German foreign policy, and I'm gonna cite that whole ""self defense against murder cultists"" thing again, because it's the whole damn context of late pre-war international politics.  The Soviets occupied the eastern half of Poland and prevented the Nazis from grabbing the whole country. This might be a little hypocritical but in the context of fighting a war with genocidal maniacs I'm willing to cut the Allies a little bit of slack?  Finally, Poland didn't invade Germany, it was the other way around, and that makes all the difference. My neighbor might think my house is really cool, but that does NOT make it okay for me to go over to his house, rape his wife, kill them both, enslave their children and annex their property.   Once the war started, the British and other allies imposed a ford blockade of Germany. This prevented her from feeding all the people within her borders. Therefore, Germany decided to kill the ""lesser"" peoples (Jews, Poles, Slavs, etc.) in order to save the Germans from starving, since some people would have to die anyway. The Allies knew this would happen and thus are responsible for these deaths.   Unmitigated horseshit. The Nazis were murdering ""useless mouths"" before the war even started, and one of the major reasons their agricultural production sucked was a major shortage of manpower. There was never a legitimate economic rationale for genocide, they killed people on a remarkably stupid and unscientific idea of Aryan racial superiority. Best part? Germans aren't even really Aryan, they stole the name and history from goddamn Central Asians. Hard to claim inherent racial superiority when your heritage is living in mud huts when the Italians were living in marble cities and ruling most of the known world.  That aside, you know who also suffered a blockade and severe food shortages? Britain. You know what the British didn't do? Murder all the Welsh.   The Germans could not save these people by making peace, since they would have to unconditionally surrender, including to the Soviets.   The Germans had a lot of options, like not starting the goddamn war and not murdering millions of innocent people."

From Max Hasting's Inferno,   Through August the Luftwaffe progressively increased the intensity of its assaults, attacking Fighter Command Airfields--though only briefly radar stations. Air Chief Marshal Sir Hugh Dowding, C-in-C of Fighter Command, began the battle with an average of 600 aircraft available for action, while the Germans deployed a daily average of around 750 serviceable bombers, 250 dive-bombers, and over 600 single-engined and 150 twin-engined fighters, organized in three air fleets. Souteast England was the main battleground, but Dowding was also obliged to defend the northeast and southwest from long-range attacks. (Pg 85)  Both air forces wildly overestimated the damage they inflected on each other. But the Germans’ intelligence failure was far more serious, because it sustained their delusion that they were winning. Fighter Command’s stations were targeted by forty Luftwaffe raids during August and early September, yet only two—Manston and Lympne on the Kent coast—were put out of action for more than a few hours, and the radar recievers were largely spared from attention. By late August the Luftwaffe believed Fighter Command’s first-line strength had been halved, to 300 aircraft. In reality, however, Dowding still deployed around twice that number: attrition was working to the advantage of the British. Between 8 and 23 August, the RAF lost 204 aircraft, but during that month 476 new fighters were built, and many more repaired. The Luftwaffe lost 397, of which 181 were fighters, while only 313 Bf-109s and Bf-110s were produced by German factories. Fighter Command lost 104 pilots killed in the middle fortnight of August, against 623 Luftwafffe airmen dead or captured. (Pg 85-86, emphasis mine)   But go ahead and keep living in denial. The Wehrmacht were totes the best military in the history of ever even though they lost. The Lustwaffe totally would have won in the skies of Britain...somehow...and the Nazi's were going to use North Africa for all the oil that literally no on on Earth knew existed."

ShitWehraboosSay,3e5j3f,WalkingOsteoclast,3,Wed Jul 22 02:59:25 2015 UTC,"A disclaimer: I am probably mildly biased by the fact that my grandmother was a codebreaker for the British during the Second World War, even if I never did meet her.   Look the manpower issue is a factor but alone was it enough to sink the Germans? Was it more important than Ultra? I don't think it was.   Well, yes, actually it was. Liechtenstein could have an army of telepaths, but without numbers and firepower, it wouldn’t suffice to hold off Germany. Or, if you want a more relevant comparison, it wouldn’t do the Royal Navy or the US Navy any good to know where the U-boats were, if they couldn’t send hunter-killer groups out after them. Cryptology certainly helped, and made it easier to win, but it wasn’t war winning on its lonesome and no reputable historian would make that claim.   That’s not to say that you could do without cryptology, mind you, just that it wasn’t what singlehandedly was responsible for winning the war. Its absence could manage to singlehandedly lose it, but that’s true of most things.   The German war machine was immense and it took over Europe in a staggeringly fast period of time. It had immense numbers of foreign recruits, and if the war had gone on longer these recruiting efforts would have furthered these efforts.   Yes, and the Allies also had further recruits available (though not so much the UK admittedly). Also the Nazis were a bit more interested in killing off those that they occupied than they were in recruiting them and many “volunteers” only did so after various threats of unpleasantries from the German occupiers.   Yes it depended on slave labour for weapons manufacturer but this was partly due to losing immense numbers of men in campaigns that failed due to Ultra. Had those men survived, had they succeeded in their objectives then the war would have been completely different.   Nope. German forced labor started pretty much from day one and was an essential part of the German industrial strategy.   This gave the Allies and the USSR enough time to spool up their industrial military complex. However, imagine if the Germans hadn't invaded the USSR when it did.   You mean, imagine if the Soviets had had an extra year to build defensive fortifications, train troops, and reequip with T-34s and KVs? Seriously, why do you people always think that the Axis get to do their stuff in a vacuum?    The crux of the war lay in North Africa. Rommel's north Africa invasion was about oil, and the number one reason why he lost was due to Ultra intercepts giving the allies precise targeting information on replacements, spare parts and supplies critical for Rommel's campaign.   No, Rommel was sent to keep the Italians from having their asses handed to them after a failed invasion of Egypt in an attempt to seize the Suez Canal and lost primarily because Rommel was a strategic idiot who didn’t grasp the concept of “Don’t outrun your logistics train.” Oil wasn’t a reason for the North African campaign because Libyan oil wouldn’t be discovered until 1959 and the Persian Gulf was not the major oil producer it later became. The United States and Latin America accounted for something like 75% of world oil production in 1940.   They were battle harden troops that would have been moved into the western front for the invasion of England had they not been lost.   Sent to the Eastern Front because nobody was stupid enough to attempt an invasion of England. River barges crossing the Channel at night against the Royal Navy is just a horrific idea.   Now imagine Rommel had won North Africa and imagine those numbers were allied losses. Imagine North Africa under Axis control.   An impossible situation: There simply wasn’t the rail or port infrastructure available to the Nazis and Italians in order to defeat the British and Americans nor could the RM have kept the RN and USN from severing their supply lines even without Ultra.   Now think of the other really critical war at the time. The battle of Britian. As a precursor to Operation Barbarossa the Germans needed air superiority over England. Goeing's campaign to destroy the RAF had almost succeeded. Though with the Luftwaffe fighting into two theaters they were stretched. Yet in my scenario the Luftwaffe is able to move several thousand aircraft back to the Western France. The RAF were weeks away from annihilation already when the Germans began bombing civilian targets thus giving the RAF breathing space to recover and destroy the last of the Luftwaffe's offensive capabilities. In turn RAF airfields were rebuilt, and operations changed from defensive to to that of strategic bombing.   Common mythology: In reality, the British were winning the Battle of Britain, the Luftwaffe switched to city bombing because they were taking unsustainable losses going after the RAF, and they were doing negligible damage to the RAF because it turns out that dropping bombs into a grass airstrip really doesn’t do that much.   Had Ultra not existed the Germans would have destroyed the RAF.   Worst case scenario, the RAF pulls north outside of the range of the Luftwaffe to attack it directly, but more than capable of attacking Luftwaffe attempts to support any sort of landing.   They would have had air superiority and in turn would have invaded England, moving forces from North Africa to assist.   Not even in Goering’s most opium fueled dreams could they have ever invaded England, much less so successfully.   Without fighting to fronts, without England as a staging point for Allied aid to the USSR, and with loss of England the Allied war effort would have been dealt a huge blow. Seriously think about England being lost. No Malta conference. No USSR being attacked for southern Caucasus oil.   You do realize that England was never necessary as a staging point for delivering aid to the Soviets, right? Convoys were entirely capable of sailing from America straight to Murmansk. For that matter, the large majority of Soviet-destined Lend-Lease supplies never went near England: 50% went via the Pacific Route and 27% via the Persian Corridor.   I'm sure the Germans would have invaded the USSR but they would have done it much later and on their own terms and not because they were forced to do so.   At which point they run into an even stronger Soviet opposition.   Seriously who would have been left? The US, Canada and Australia. With the war in the pacific sapping a huge amount of resources and with German support who knows how Japan would have progressed?    Japan occupied something like 15% of American war production. For Japan, war with the United States was the most difficult war of their civilization. But for America, it was Tuesday.   Without the British to provide scientific and material resources to the Manhatten project would it have been ready at that point?   Whether it was or not is pretty much irrelevant, they were the cherry on top of a naval mine and aerial firebombing sundae.    With the Germans able to consolidate Europe, England and North Africa the entire war would be completely different. What would the US have done? Yes the US had a huge amount of manufacturing but the advanced weapons being built by the Germans were coming online. Strategic long range bombers, submarines, nuclear weapons research. All of that happening without any allied strategic bombing   Well, the US had B-29s, B-32s, progressing to the B-36s, more than 140 aircraft carriers, a quite competent ASW program (and I really don’t think you want to try and project even a Type XXI campaign into the Gulf of Mexico against 1945 USN), and an actual functioning nuclear weapons program, unlike the Nazi one that didn’t think a bomb was actually possible.   A lot of German aid to Japan was intercepted because of Ultra. Again imagine if this had not happened. Imagine Japanese aircraft flying with BMW engines? Flying with more armor on their fuel tanks. Imagine the Japanese had moved to Engima? Hell the US success against the Japanese was primarily because of intelligence intercepts as well.   And what of it? They would still be outnumbered, outgunned, out-trained, and low on the vital materials necessary to do anything with those engines. Also, I’m not sure what the benefit would have been to the Japanese switching to an already broken code system.

You're right.  Oh and bonus, not only did the Germans have horse-mounted formations, but they were rather dogshite when compared to the mounted forces of other belligerents. An excerpt from a response I ghostwrote before joining reddit on AskHistorians:   The Polish like wise used their cavalry in conjunction with their armored trains to swiftly remount between defensive positions and fought delaying action after delaying action, often on foot with the most basic of towed heavy weapons. In their case however, they did have isolated incidents where they used sabre and lance against German infantry. One particular case had them routing a German battalion that they came upon quite suddenly, only to be scattered in some disarry when German scout-cars came to reverse the situation (the birth of the pure propaganda piece of Polish lancers dashing themselves to pieces against Panzer IIs).  ...German 'mounted' combat is few and far between during its period of heavy use (39-42), without a doubt there were many smaller mounted actions, but the only real ones of worth occured during the Polish campaign and often against their counterparts. In none of these situations did they come off the better. This again can be chalked up to Germany's more modern doctrine, with focus on dismounted action and a healthy respect for the mass-carnage they risk with any sort of bold mounted movement.  ... As a last note, [The RKKA] on the Eastern Front still maintained huge mounted forces, that fought with incredible success given the modern nature of WWII. The Soviet cavalry is often only mentioned as footnotes, but they operated often as self-contained units, providing their own towed anti-tank, anti-air and pack-artillery units. This anamoly may be written off as simple convience on the Soviet Union's part; they did not lack for horseflesh and where not unlike the Confederate States of 1861 in that they had no lack for trained/natural riders."

ShitWehraboosSay,3e26gx,tossaway4856,5,Tue Jul 21 21:11:18 2015 UTC,"The US only had two units conduct anything approaching sustained mounted action in WW2, the first was the US 26th Cavalry regiment whose's short-lived combat record can be described as par excellence, not as a series of blunders. The second was the actions of the 3rd Provisional Cavalry Troop. In reality a mechanized cavalry unit in the 3rd Infantry Division, the unit was horse and mule mounted by the division commander for the duration of its time in the Anzio beachhead. Considering it performed just successfully and long enough to be used by General Herr (retired chief of Cavalry) as an example/argument that horses still belonged in combat, it has no 'grand blunders' to its name. I'd give the '2nd greatest blunder' to the Soviets when Cavalry-Mechanized Group Pliev was destroyed. Even then, the Soviets being the 'close second' is largely chalked up to simple statistics: They hands-down had the largest horse mounted force so it would only make sense that the greatest mounted successes and failures would be concentrated in their army.  The last US Cavalry charge is credited to the 26th Cavalry and was a wild success by every definition of the word. At this point in time the 26th Cavalry was holding back something in excess of a division-battlegroup (in short, a force almost three times its size) and covering routing Filipino forces. They were conducting an aggressive patrol when they spotted a Japanese unit crossing a river bank into a town. The forward unit was marching through the town and the patrol leader saw oppurtunity, conducted a pistol charge down the main street of the village, routing the vanguard. The charge carried them to the river bank, where his patrol dismounted and formed line-of-skirmish along the river bank and forced the Japanese unit (still-mid-river) to pull back. Up until this point they were basically the only US unit that had consistently shown itself able to accomplish its objectives against superior numbers.   To be fair to the Germans, their cavalry units weren't incompetent, they just often committed atrocities (being relegated to anti-partisan duties frequently) and were rather unimaginative compared to basically every other mounted arm. Its intensely surprising too, given that the Versailles treaty actually allowed the Reichswehr to maintain a disproportionate amount of cavalry (something like a third of the 100, 000 men were in Cavalry units in the 20s). You'd think with such a plethora of horseman they'd find experiments to keep them relevant, like the US and USSR did - in addition to mechanizing. When they were committed to even relatively minor defensive actions to shore up the lines in Winter 1941, they often got devastated. Yerger basically chalks up the 8.SS's ability to hold the line to rabid fanaticism more than anything approaching skill. He describes local counterattacks by them during the Winter '41 period as being excessive, poorly planned and altogether over-costly when successful. Keep in mind this is a military often credited with its skilled (if questionable) local counterattacks, against a very much infantile RKKA.   By contrast every other mounted arm performed quite well. The British 1st Cavalry division participated in the invasion of Vichy Syria and acquitted itself with speed and skill. They later became the 10th Armoured Division, I believe."

Well, Hitler may not have thought terribly highly of cavalry based on his WW1 experience, and even if you ignore that the Nazi party made a great deal of effort to bill themselves as the new hotness, and the pride in German mechanical engineering they built persists to this day, even if it basically involved cheating (queue propaganda video comparing the Panther to the M3 Lee here). It wouldn't surprise me to learn that the Germans intentionally avoided cavalry development for fear of appearing Napoleonic.

They were exploitation forces after a breakthrough, and that often meant that they were the tip of the spears that counterattacks sought to blunt.  Its unsurprising that even late war these Cavalry-Mechanized Groups were often surrounded and destroyed by fire brigades, its a risk that every exploiting force puts itself in when it goes full speed in pursuit."

ShitWehraboosSay,3dxqt7,EvanHarper,11,Mon Jul 20 16:14:35 2015 UTC,"It just seems like a variant of the Broken Window fallacy to me.   This exactly.  War only helps the economy or scientific research if you compare wartime deficit spending and heavy wartime investment in technology to peacetime balanced-budget orthodoxy and peacetime underinvestment. (Contrary to popular myth, the FDR administration refused to run properly Keynesian policies, instead raising taxes to pay up front for its new spending programs, which neutralized their effect.)  It's not that war has some crazy paradoxical effect where it turns out to be a good thing. It's that war imperatives can cause politicians to drop stupid, self-defeating economic policies that they should have dropped anyway. World War II didn't help the German or Russian or Japanese economies because they weren't in the very specific situation of Britain, France, and the USA – Russia's economy wasn't subject to recessions at all, and Germany and Japan were if anything overheating and facing serious inflationary pressures before they got into the war."

Many people don't realize that science and technology isn't a linear path.  Just because a period of war brought forward certain advancements, doesn't mean that the same period spent in peace-time wouldn't have brought forth similar advancements or even completely different advancements.  Furthermore, war advancement focuses on the practical applications of existing theory.  The A-Bomb was a good example of this.  The physics of it was more or less already existent at the time, they just had to turn the theory into a weapon schematic and that schematic into an actual bomb.  Most of the budget of the Manhattan Project was spent on stuff like actually enriching the fissile material, not theory.  The implication is that if a war drags on long enough, people run out of theories to weaponise, and that's the limit of war-time innovation.   And then there's all the student-aged men and women who would be drafted or join the military. Not to mention all the death and misery that war brings.

Body lice don't stay on corpses for more than a few hours after death. The common assumption that handling corpses is terribly dangerous is really just cultural taboo masquerading as sanitation; it's much more likely that these guys got typhus infections from being around living typhus victims, given that Belsen was a raging inferno of typhus at the time. For most of these guys to have died of typhus requires that virtually all of them became infected and that the mortality rate from their infections was extraordinarily high. The post-liberation mortality rate from all causes in Belsen was about 25%. Why would the death rate be higher among a bunch of fit, military-age men who hadn't been beaten and abused and kept on starvation rations prior to the liberation?"

The Tommys and the Amis were just a hell of a lot fucking better at it. Somehow, the fact that the bombing campaign failed to completely obliterate German industry = it had no measurable effect on the German war effort and was a futile effort. Are you high? Besides wrecking the jagdwaffe, the American raids in particular caused numerous bottlenecks in German production; Panthers, fighter planes, and fuel were all quite heavily hit beginning in 1944."

In other words, without strategic bombing it would have reached a much higher efficiency than it did with it.  Just because strategic bombing didn't completely obliterate German industrial capacity doesn't mean it had no effect at all.  It's like when the talk radio echo chamber says Obamacare is making health care costs rise because costs are still going up, even though they're going up slower than without it.

What they forget about is that while not very good at killing tanks, they were great at killing supply trucks, trains, (or horse carts, since we're talking about the Germans here), they often disrupted armored attacks and panicked German troops, especially low quality troops like often encountered late in the war, forced them to conduct major movements at night and in bad weather, etc."

This is why you get into these arguments with edgy teenagers in /r/HistoryPorn – there's something deeply unacceptable to them about the idea that a whole country full of normal people with mundane lives could have been broadly on board with a genocidal, massively aggressive project.

But sir it's such a shallow and obvious statement what"
ShitWehraboosSay,3drdd7,silver_nuke13,6,Mon Jul 20 22:23:52 2015 UTC,"that were still on FREAKING HORSES IN WW2   Yeah, like the Germans. In 1945, the Germans had six cavalry divisions, and their logistics trains depended overwhelmingly on horses (by the end of the war, they had used two million horses). Cavalry were great for reconnaissance, as well as being able to rapidly move from one area to another to prevent or delay a breakthrough. It's silly to pick on the Poles for using cavalry when every other army of the time was still using them in large numbers.   But presumably you're thinking about the charge at Krojanty, as most do (with that whole Polish cavalry vs. Panzers myth). What happened was that two squadrons of Polish Ulanow charged a formation of the German 76th infantry regiment, inflicting twenty casualties and forcing them to retreat. They then held the clearing that they had cleared until several armoured cars equipped with twenty millimetre cannons and MG-34 machine-guns. These forced the Polish back with twenty killed and a further fifty wounded, including the two senior officers.   Whilst that might seem like a victory for the Germans, it allowed two Polish battalions to retreat in good order and prevent an encirclement, and the 20th Motorised Division considered a tactical retreat.  The reason that we have this myth about charging tanks surrounding it is because the next day, war correspondents and a pair of Italian journalists were shown the corpses of the cavalrymen, as well as some tanks that had arrived after the battle. Therefore, Indro Montanelli (one of the Italian journalists) wrote back home that the Poles had charged tanks. It's a very pervasive myth, and is completely wrong. What really pisses me off is that the Soviets actually did send cavalry against tanks at some points, but nobody calls them out for it.    They just went on rampage, killing innocents in villages near the border. You know what hitler did? Kept his cool.   Oh yeah, totes, Hitler was forced into a war by Poland. You're sounding somewhat similar to someone else I was arguing with who said ""ENGLAND [sic] forced Germany to go to war"".   Do you have any sources that aren't from neo-nazis or apologists which can corroborate your comments? I'm having a hard time believing it.   Oh you were talking general war casualties?   Oh yeah, it's totally normal for an occupying army to kill twenty five million civilians for no reason than their race, that just regular war for you. Things like the Barbarossa decree, the Hunger Plan and Generalplan Ost were just regular things in that period.  /s   This is not anti-Semitism. A semite is one of semitic origins. All Arabs are part of this, not only Hebrews. I have nothing against Arabs for example, I deeply respect their culture. The term you're looking for is anti-Judaic or anti-sectarianism. JEWS. ARE NOT. A RACE. It's a religion.   An·ti Sem·i·tism  hostility toward or discrimination against Jews as a religious, ethnic, or racial group.  Thanks Merriam-Webster! Anti-Semitism might literally mean hating Semites, but that's not what it's generally used to refer to. Also, I realise they aren't a race, but they were certainly treated as one by the Nazis, as people of Jewish descent were persecuted.   Now that we got that out of the way, i have nothing against a mere jew.   i'm sure that's what completely innocent people get, and not backstabbers and conmen    Well, you do seem to be dislike some of them, for sure. I see that my comment    do you actually believe that a religious group deserves to get persecuted, ostracised and at some points massacred because a few followers of the religion were/are money lenders, or have committed crimes.   might be a dash strong, but you are claiming that:   Jews put a general boycott on germany (6 days before the official start of the war) and killed their economy (which they were leeching already anyway)   Which is ridiculous. The only boycott I can think of was the Anti-Nazi boycott of '33, where foreign critics (not just Jewish people) boycotted a number of German goods in protest of the anti-Semitism of the Nazis. Do you have any information on the boycott you mentioned, because I can't find anything about it. Unless, perhaps, you meant years instead of days? If that is the case, it hardly killed the German economy.   Did you know that most of the holocaust victims actually died to typhus, since it's mathematically impossible to gas and incinerate so many people in such little time?   Whilst I don't have the time to watch the video at the moment, I will try to when I get home. However, the Typhus can be put down to negligence in a time when diseases were beginning to be understood. I also fail to see how it's mathematically impossible. Back when the Americas were being colonised, there was very little understanding of the mechanisms of the spreading of disease and the control of it, so there was little the colonists could do to help once it did spread (not that they would have, anyway). Whilst I do not doubt that natives were massacred, I don't think it compares to the Holocaust. One point, albeit not a great one, is that people of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries are more conscientious than our rather savage forebears.    (ignore the video description, some people tend to be very black and white)   No jewish massacre ever happened. Hoax was made up by Zionist liars to take Palestinian land.    I think your comment is a bit of an understatement.    If you can justify your hate for a nazi, then one is free to justify their hate towards jewish people as well   So what justification is there to hate Jewish people? My justification to hate Nazis is the awful slaughter that they wreaked upon the world. As you already said, they're a religious group and are very varied, so they shouldn't all be hated, whereas Nazis all subscribed to an ideology of hatred.   See the hypocrisy?   Nope, please explain.   Well, there were a lot of uberme-   top kek   Ok how about the medical data   Oh yeah, great one! Finding out how emaciated and ill subjects with little body fat fare in cold water has allowed hypothermia treatment to progress magnificently. Injecting caustic substances into a woman's cervix and/or uterus has allowed sterilization technology to advance tenfold.   For fuck's sake. The experiments at the camps were not in any way scientific or practical. The experiments were, a lot of the time, merely a pretty cover for the sadistic torture inflicted by people like Mengele and Clauberg.    technological research   I can't speak about G-Suits, as I know little of them, but I'm sure a more knowledgeable member of the subreddit can give you a good explanation of most of the other supposed technological innovations of Nazi Germany, such as this one, for example.   himmler also tried to delay the project as much as he could, since he considered the idea of nuking entire cities very unethical.    No, it's because he and Hitler regarded it as a ""Jewish Science"".  I feel that this photo speaks volume about what a shit Himmler was.   It only makes the majority swallow you.   Sounds like something a Neo-Nazi Jayden Smith would say (sans capital first letters of each word)."

No seriously, he named a toy skull and talks to it. See this video, watch the whole video when you have time, it's amazing.    I've come to be of the opinion that the Nazi goverment - while certainly not being the sort of state I'd advocate - really weren't all that bad. Given the feminist/pro-immigration state that's growing in Canada, I might actually prefer it.   Pro tip: Anyone who wishes they were living under Nazi rule, isn't smart enough to actually have survived under Nazi rule.    In fact, the 'final solution' was not the first solution - they attempted deportation several times.   I love when this is brought up.

Hindsight is easy    The field of history respectfully disagrees with that.    Barbarossa and even D-Day could have been a success for Germany had Hitler listened to his advisors.   Always Relevant Lecture   WW2 was quite literally Winston Churchill destroying the British empire and giving most of Europe to communist dictators for the next 50 years   As opposed to giving all of Europe to one Nazi dictator.    The pact they created after they decided they wanted to destroy Germany?   The War of Chinese, Albanian and Polish Aggression 1931-45    He took back the land stolen in the treaty of Versailles and given to Poland   You mean all the Poland? Also, stolen? Germany signed that treaty! Besides, if one is an ardent irredentist, basically everyone in Europe has claims against everyone else.    England and France decided to fight Germany, not the other way around   This is clearly the German perspective. Apparently Ribbentrop, who had extensive ""knowledge"" of the French and British psyches through his wine exports, told Hitler that the British were joking about that protecting Polish independence thing. He also told Hitler that the German invasion would make the Chamberlain Government immediately fall.    Patton's famous opinion was that we should have kept fighting after VE Day and drove the Russians back.    Much like many German generals, Patton looks at things from a tactical perspective, not a strategic one.    We were the most mobilized we'd ever be for war, they had taken the worst losses   There is a reason the Allied plan to attack the Soviets was called Operation Unthinkable. To quote it: ""there is virtually no limit to the distance to which it would be necessary for the allies to penetrate into Russia in order to render further resistance impossible."" Source As further evidence, the plan itself changes from ""can we impose our will on the Soviets"" to ""can we protect the British Isles and maybe keep a part of Belgium?""   we had nukes   6, According to the NRDC"

For instance, Finland would never have been politically willing to attack Murmansk. They really weren't into the whole Barbarossa bandwagon in the first place, and they recognized the risks of war with Russia to the point where they were extremely cautious about claiming Soviet territory and very wary of German promises.  Similarly, if Japan elects to pressure the CCCP in Manchuria with an expanded China campaign, adopting the Imperial Army's strategic vision over the Navy's, then their wildly successful invasions of Southeast Asia never happen...  2/3rds of this stuff is small potatoes. Seriously, if this were a list remotely worth respecting, it should include the following conditions at the very least:   real summit-level mutual cooperation between Germany and its allies. The degree of uncoordinated and independent action exhibited by the Axis throughout the war was laughable in comparison to the collaboration shown by the Allies. Nazi support of nationalist movements in occupied countries, particularly in Eastern Europe. This one is huge. Acknowledgement of nationalist movements in Ukraine and the Balkans could have transformed the face of occupied Europe. No deportations of slave labor. No Holocaust. Humane treatment of Soviet prisoners and humane conduct in the occupied USSR. Are we laughing uproariously yet? Complete reconsideration of the strategic and operational goals of Barbarossa. Total war industrial footing established in the German homeland by 1941. (Of course, putting Germany on a total war footing immediately begins eroding Hitler's elaborately constructed illusion of an easy war at home) Albert Speer embarks on his campaign to streamline the German war industry at least two years earlier, concentrating on fewer variants of aircraft and vehicles and reorganizing war production on a national scale.   I'm sure I'm missing some other obvious things...  This puts Germany far closer to having a fighting chance in the East than the nonsense above. And even then, it's not even close to a sure bet. They still very likely lose. With only 300,000 men as a reserve going into Barbarossa, the German military was never going to be prepared to withstand the losses of the meatgrinder on the Ostfront regardless of what it did. The entire goal of ""destroying the Red Army as a fighting force"" was futile from the start had they known the true overall strength of the RKKA.  Of course, the changes above require a total abandonment of Nazi ideology and an impossible magical transformation of Hitler's fundamental personality, racial policy, and strategic vision, to the point where the Nazis are literally no longer Nazis, so... yeah... this leads us to what we already know, which is that Nazi Germany, led by the ideals it upheld, could never have won the war."

In January 1942 they decided that nuclear energy could not be exploited for military purposes during the crucial period when the war would be decided. They thought isotope separation was practically impossible, and although von Weizsäcker realized that plutonium could be produced in a reactor and made into a bomb, this never translated into an actual plan to make a plutonium bomb once they had a reactor. With typical Nazi inefficiency the program was split up among rival groups that acted autonomously in their own narrow interests and never had a practical plan imposed from above.  Vemork was a hydroelectric plant that made heavy water. There were never any factories there and it would have been a nonsensical place to put them.

You can make a reasonably compact, if heavy, gun-type bomb, but plutonium's high spontaneous fission rate requires implosion, which in turn requires a lot of bulky explosives, detonators, batteries and so on. It's going to weigh more than the Do-217 can safely carry, but worse than that, it's going to be impossible to carry internally and ridiculously draggy for external carriage. An 8,000 lb implosion bomb is a lot more demanding to carry than, say, 8 × 1,000 lb high explosive bombs.  Unless you're willing to accept a pitifully low yield for how much effort you've spent on the thing, or if you invent advanced late 1950s-era digital computers that can run the calculations necessary to make efficient compact imposion designs work.  The B-29 was the only American aircraft that could carry the bomb, and even then it had to be extensively modified. And yet the Germans never managed to match even the B-17 or B-24 historically."

Dude's sure written a lot of books about the Luftwaffe, which isn't necessarily a bad thing in itself (from a quick glance, seems to be mostly technical descriptions of the aircraft), but this one worries me.   The plans that Nazi Germany had to raid & bomb NYC & the eastern seabord are revealed in this book.   As though that was ever a realistic possibility.   They depended upon the use of transoceanic aircraft, such as the 6-engined Ju 390, Me 264 or Ta 400, but the 3rd Reich was unable to produce these machines in sufficient numbers.   Total numbers of those aircraft produced are, respectively, two, three, and zero.   If the USSR had been conquered, however, these plans would have become a reality.   ""This impossible thing could have happened if only this other impossible thing happened first.""   With the seizure of vital resources from the USSR the Wehrmacht would have had enough fuel & material to mass-produce giant bomber aircraft: it was a near-run thing.   We may as well be discussing Nazi moon base right now.   The collapse of the Wehrmacht infrastructure & the premature end of the 1000-Year Reich ensured that plans for long-range remote-controlled missiles never got past the drawing board.   Use of the term ""1000-Year Reich"" in a non-ironic context: major red flag.   Manfred Griehl makes it clear that until the collapse numerous secret research laboratories seem to have worked in parallel developing nuclear power & explosives.    The Germans were nowhere near developing atomic weapons. They literally weren't even certain that a self-sustaining nuclear reaction was even possible before seeing the Manhattan Project's results.   Only classified material held within British, French & American archives can prove whether these laboratories were close to perfecting small atomic explosives.   While you're in the archives, see if you can find anything about that moon base.

ShitWehraboosSay,3dimov,LeuCeaMia,3,Fri Jul 17 04:25:42 2015 UTC,"Steltexolite is very much still used by modern tanks. The choice in composite armor materials is mostly down to tradeoffs.   This combination of light weight and high hardness offers resistance to KE warheads comparable to RHA and, more importantly, resistance to shaped charge warheads up to twice the amount RHA offers. While this makes them good armor material, there are several drawbacks to the use of ceramics in tank design. Firstly ceramics lack mechanical strength and can’t be used as support structures. Furthermore, to be most effective they must be encased in metal, therefore diluting some of the weight and performance benefit. While the most basic ceramic, Alumina [AL 2 O 3 ] is about as expensive as Aluminum or hard steel [twice the price of RHA], the really mass efficient ceramics can be up to 10 times the cost of Alumina. Ceramics have additional performance problems: They shatter on impact because the mechanical strength can’t survive the shock waves bouncing off the free tile edges. In tests, the resistance of a shattered steel-ceramic target ranges from 95% vs. AP shots to 80% vs. APFSDS. In addition, test on AP impacts of sloped ceramic-steel targets show that resistance is less than the LOS value, when the slanted resistance of RHA is more. In tests against APFSDS against slanted ceramics [SiC, AIN, AD-96, B 4 C & TiB 2 ] offered about the same resistance as the LOS suggests."

ShitWehraboosSay,3dgrpe,EvanHarper,28,Thu Jul 16 21:24:21 2015 UTC,"'Nazi' used to describe the WWII German State and all its manifestations is a perfectly correct usage. This BBC report, for example, refers to 'Nazi troops', 'Nazi dive bombers' and the 'Nazi war machine'.  The usage is common and that's how language works. It's you who is trying to be a revisionist in changing usage. I can only guess at your motivation [...]  There isn't a problem in the 'Nazi' usage. It's traditional and goes right back to the war itself; and in the context of the taking over, by the Nazi party, of the entire State, it is defensible and it makes sense. When a BBC report speaks of 'Nazi dive bombers' it is obviously not asserting that the dive bombers had joined the Nazi party or even that they were flown by members of the Nazi party. They were war weapons of the Nazi state.  Now the reason this comes up all the time is because posters [...] pretend there is only one, limited meaning to the use of the word 'Nazi' - to assert affiliation with or membership of the Nazi party. This faux-innocent interpretation is demonstrably not true historically, and it's not true linguistically.  I think people want to keep making this obviously silly point in order to deflect guilt. They want to be able to say that most Germans were not supportive of the Nazis."
ShitWehraboosSay,3dgrpe,Astrogator,18,Thu Jul 16 04:48:17 2015 UTC,"'Nazi' evolved as a German political term to describe members of the National Socialist party, analogous to 'Sozi' for Social Democrats, so I can understand such arguments from a historical PoV. But Germany became a national socialist state. It's perfectly OK to call the state and members of his armed forces or bureaucracy 'Nazis'. What I find a bit worrying though is the distinction it allows to be made between 'Nazis' and 'Germans' which to me seems often to be used to describe the former as something of an abnormal, external force that came over the Germans, which we had to be liberated from."

I suspect there was also quite a bit of subpar house music as well, but I digress, let's....   Read on!   Okay! But first, a little bit of Britain's little helper before we dive in.   See, the Wehrmacht was huge, and to blame an army of mostly drafted soldiers for the crimes of a minority is just as stupid as giving credit to the Wehrmacht for the good deeds of a few.   You're right. Which is why, legally, it was decided that since the perceived minority was able to run rampant with little interference, the entire organization was criminal and complicit.  Legal reasoning - it works.   So in your book the British and American armies are cruel murderers who bomb civilians to death in their sleep and the Red Army are rapists and thieves?    AYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY LMAO   The Polish are genocidal because they killed German civilians?   gen·o·cide  Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide defines Genocide as ""acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group...""  With the intent to destroy. TIL Partisans were fighting for the actual destruction of the German people and culture. Fuck off.   Not all of them were antisemites. Just like the Poles (which were so happy about the end of ww2 that they celebrated it with a nice little pogrom of their own...).   Lets top the turd pie with a Tu Quoque cherry! The rampant antisemitism in Europe and North America has been duly noted, intensely studied, and deeply regretted. First and foremost, this antisemitism never manifested into full scale industrial Genocide until Hitler assumed power in Germany. Secondly none of this fucking matters. Seriously, it doesn't. The fact that Stalin was a bad dude or that a visible percentage of the Polish population had antisemitic views has no impact nor relevance to German war crimes, they do not absolve them, they do not reduce them.   And the American Air Force fueled the atomic bomber...   Same shit, different day. Another Tu Quoque - asides from the fact that the bombings of Japan - lamentable though they were - do not qualify legally as genocide, they have no relevance whatsoever to German war crimes. Apologist deflecting once again at work.   The Red Army, the United States Army and every single other military entity in history has brutally murdered civilians. It's not a unique thing for the Wehrmacht   The Red Army, The United States Army and every single other military entity in history has brutally *killed civilians. Lets be clear here - collateral is fucking disgusting, and its an unfortunate reality of war. There's a difference between 'shelling a town that has civilians in the line of fire' and 'digging a ditch behind the huts and killing every man, woman and child' in cold blood.  Murder and killing are two very, very different things. The moment you believe the two are the same are the moment you reveal yourself to be detached from reality. As /u/ajuc points out its falsehood for me, I'll do the favor of backing him up.   In almost every instance in which the US Army, and its personnel had allegedly been conducting crimes against humanity or war crimes, the US Army (despite not being a signet to relevant International law) has shown intense disgust, investigations and often trials and convictions. To stress here, the fact that the military is at one and the same time the investigator, the defendant (by proxy) and the prosecutor suggests a low level of Procedural Fairness. Yet, despite this, time and again the US Army has shown considerable impartiality and humanity in punishing and censuring the criminality of its soldiers.  By contrast, the Werhmacht and SS handed out anti-partisan badges and if Yerger's examination of the After Action Reports of the SS-Kavalrie-Brigade (subordinated to Wehrmacht command) suggest, even medals for valor for grossly criminal actions.    Well if you want to be so specific why not point out warcrimes committed by the allies aswell [sic]?   Finally, we ask again - what does US Army or RKKA criminal actions have to do with Wehrmacht criminal actions? Absolutely nothing. They are strictly speaking not related and equally deplorable, one does not lessen nor absolve the other. This is desperate thrashing by an apologist and a racist.  This leads to hilarious falsehoods and backtrackings   Not sure if you're familiar of the ehtnic cleansing of germans by poland between ww1 and ww2 [sic] after ww2. You should be though if you're so quick in pointing fingers.   And the absence of actual evidence -    Can't link to history books. But if you're interested you might use google?   -which I have been more than happy to provide above instead. Its quite accessible actually, the US Army in particular has been highly transparent in dissecting the role its soldiers took in sexual assaults, isolated instances of passion-murders and outright criminal conduct.  AYYYY LMAO JUST GOOGLE IT BUD. OR TRY WWW.STORMFRONT.COM YOU'LL FIND WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT THERE.   Have you really never heard of Danzig ...?

The communist party almost certainly would have won the post-war election if the CIA didn't pump unlimited funds into the conservative party, and I think that backs it up a bit.  Add on top of that the fact that, while Italy was a warmongering, aggresive, expansionist, complicit, etc. country during WW2 they don't even really place in the genocide olympics and didn't really cooperate with the holocaust.  In other words, I guess what I'm saying is it seems like the Italian people had more of a conscience and more fortitude when it came to resisting their system than the Germans and Austrians managed to muster.

I don't however believe that it really detracts from the resistance movements if they're not particularly well-spread.  For example the French resistance was incredibly slow in starting off, and the Free French movement was decidedly unenthusiastic at first. Very few of the captured Vichy soldiers during TORCH wanted to join the Free French. The lack of enthusiasm remained a fact for a quite a while thereafter.  Yet by Summer 1944 the French were able to land a full army in France, and FFI units were being organized into battalions. Resistance grows as it becomes obvious resistance will actually be effective. It takes quite a bit of bravery to be a resistance member when its bonafide suicide.

I don't see them being put in prison. Or what about the American and British bombers that eradicated Dresden, Hamburg etc.? What about the French terrorists who killed German soldiers which was already an international crime at that time? Justice isn't a one-way street.   Jesus Christ. Hit all the buzzwords with this one:  ""Greatest mass rape""  ""Muh Dresden""  ""French terrorists""   He was an accountant that worked in a prison camp. I wonder, did they get the gardener too?   ""Prison camp"" Literally the most famous death camp of all time where over one million people were killed.    Yeah that's.... fucking retarded. But what else to expect from the 1940's version of a modern SJW?   That quote was in relation to one of the prosecutors in the case. People who want justice for the Holocaust are now SJWs, the word has truly become meaningless.   No matter how you twist & turn it, it just doesn't make sense. The real damage was done by those actively participating in the forefront of the Nazi regime, not the common people that just wanted to be left alone. Insinuating the latter is indeed fucking retarded.   ""Common people""  ""Worked in Auschwitz to help facilitate the Holocaust""  Pick one.   Every member of society is responsible for his actions. If his actions include being accessory to or commiting crimes in the name of or for or ordered by his society, those crimes are his, too.   Based /u/astrogator laying down some common sense.   Just for fun, lets see how the Neo-Nazis are handling it:   About time another horrible evil nazi was prosecuted and plastered all over the news. People are starting to forget about Hitler's human skin lamp-shades and the Auschwitz rollercoaster of death, they need to be reminded! I say, it's quite right to put a unwilling accountant up for trial for murdering 300,000 people, even at the age of 92. Have to prove an example that this kind of pure evil behaviour is unacceptable in our society!  Unless it's being done to Palestinians by jews. Then it's ok See: Muh holocaust   Don't know what I expected."

And among all German armies, his units had the largest number of Mischlinge (half Jews) in key positions, including Chief of Staff Fritz Bayerlein. These people then came back to Germany boasting about serving under Rommel like everyone else.  And also, if you had served under him, you were free to cite him as inspiration when you did a Good Samaritan act yourself, like Captain Hellmuth Lang (no, this one was not Jewish) who rescued Generaloberst Heinrici, who had Jewish blood and married a Mischling wife - Lang just had to boast that Rommel had been his superior and he didn't want Heinrici, who had been Rommel's superior, to share Rommel's fate.

From: Tigers in the Mud   Our most dangerous opponents in Russia were the T34 and the T43, which were equipped with long-barreled 76.2-mm cannons. The tanks were dangerous to us from 600 meters in the front, 1,500 meters in the sides, and as far as 1,800 meters in the rear.   Later in the book, Carius refers to a T85 although he doesn't give a description; the T85 possibly refers to the actual T-34-85.

This was real footage of those guys who fought ages ago. It was then that I watched a documentary that would change everything. Americans were the coolest, they can beat everyone... or could they? It was a documentary about aerial combat. I still remember the voice of the narrator~ Gabby Gabreski, 28 kills. Gabreski would share his experiences as an Ace, I thought it was incredible that a man can shoot down 28 planes, truly a hero... Adolf Galland, 104 kills. My heart stopped. What? 104 kills? How? A German? Germany lost the war this can't be true. Gunther Rall, 275 Kills. I didn't even know what those numbers were, but I knew that 100 was a lot more than 28 and 275 is surely higher than 100. Surely both of them were fake, Germany was the enemy, a beaten one at that, but how could I deny what those two men were saying? I couldn't understand all their words but how they spoke sounded so honest and proud. 16 kills, 20 kills, 21 and a half kills; all went through one ear and out the other, the Americans weren't so impressive after all. Erich Hartmann, 352 kills and highest scoring ace of history. 352?! I excitedly rushed to my father, jumped up on his chair where he slept and told him what I had heard.

ShitWehraboosSay,3db57u,Subotan,15,Tue Jul 14 23:29:02 2015 UTC,"Wow, this guy is stupid. Even Wikipedia has some basic explanations for why this the case:   A number of factors probably contributed to the very high totals of the top German aces. For a limited period (especially during Operation Barbarossa), many Axis victories were over obsolescent aircraft and either poorly trained or inexperienced Allied pilots.[15] In addition, Luftwaffe pilots generally flew many more individual sorties (sometimes well over 1000) than their Allied counterparts, a witness of their expert survival capabilities. Moreover, they often kept flying combat missions until they were captured, incapacitated, or killed, while successful Allied pilots were usually either promoted to positions involving less combat flying or routinely rotated back to training bases to pass their valuable combat knowledge to younger pilots   But who cares about things such as doctrine and the strategic situation, cos the Germans were beaten which means they're the underdogs and therefore the coolest."
ShitWehraboosSay,3db57u,disguise117,7,Tue Jul 14 23:52:23 2015 UTC,"Well, also consider that the Luftwaffe basically ran out of planes/pilots/fuel in late 1943...  It's hard to shoot down an enemy if they can't even get into the air."
ShitWehraboosSay,3db57u,buy_a_pork_bun,4,Wed Jul 15 02:27:51 2015 UTC,"A lot of this is explained by the fact that all of those aces fought in the Eastern front flying against low and slow, relatively defenseless and obsolete aircraft.

ShitWehraboosSay,3db57u,OMGSPACERUSSIA,3,Wed Jul 15 03:35:41 2015 UTC,"There are debates regarding the precision of those numbers. The very nature of air combat allowed inflation, which happened on both sides. But I  don't know many historians who will argue against the facts that Erich Hartmann was the highest scoring ace, Luffwaffe pilots had much more kills than the Allied ones... etc   There were reasons for this, among which the most important was that the German pilots never got rotated out of service. They just flew until they saw the wooden crosses. While the Allied countries rotated and retired their aces and made them instructors.  There were Allied aces with higher kill ratio than Hartmann, who flew 1,404 combat missions anyway."
ShitWehraboosSay,3db57u,treebeard87,5,Tue Jul 14 23:53:00 2015 UTC,"I was interested so I did the math. According to this, America's highest scoring ace Richard Bong flew a total of 27 missions for 40 confirmed kills. That puts him at 1.48 kills per mission. In contrast, Erich Hartmanns 352 kills in 1,404 combat missions comes up with 0.25 kills per mission, considerably less than Bong.   This is ridiculous of course but if Bong somehow flew 1,404 missions at the same rate he did for his 27, he would have come up with...  2079.99 kills"
ShitWehraboosSay,3db57u,jeteaway,5,Wed Jul 15 00:14:26 2015 UTC,"Not to mention many of the German aces cheated a bit.  Most of the Soviet air force was destroyed on the ground in the opening phases of Barbarossa, leading to rather inflated kill counts."
ShitWehraboosSay,3db57u,treebeard87,3,Wed Jul 15 01:07:01 2015 UTC,"Yes, by theory that was possible. But in practice it could've turned out quite different. The matter is whether you will still be alive after the first 100 missions.  You will need lot and lot of luck. It could've turned out different for Hartmann too.  I know he was under stress himself, flying multiple sorties per day and knowing that it would never end until his death or the end of the war . He said during one of those times Hitler called him to Berlin for an award ceremony, he was heavily drunken and despite trying hard, they could not make him sober again when he met Hitler (He mistook Hitler's hat for his too). He said he drank because one never knew whether tomorrow one would be alive or not."
ShitWehraboosSay,3db57u,jeteaway,3,Wed Jul 15 00:36:57 2015 UTC,"If I remember correctly Hartmann was a pretty cautious guy, too. He didn't like dogfighting and would usually only engage when he had the element of surprise. I'd imagine Major Bong was somewhat more aggressive."
ShitWehraboosSay,3db57u,treebeard87,4,Wed Jul 15 01:19:18 2015 UTC,"Yes Hartmann didn't like dogfighting. His basic technique was quite dangerous though. He wouldn't shoot until the other plane filled the whole cockpit window and many times when the enemy was destroyed, the debris damaged his own plane as well."
ShitWehraboosSay,3db57u,IronWorksWT,2,Wed Jul 15 01:35:27 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, he bailed out quite a few times. It makes me wonder, though, how would Hartmann have faired in a dogfight if he was so keen on avoiding them."
ShitWehraboosSay,3db57u,potato_delusions,3,Wed Jul 15 02:54:55 2015 UTC,"He was capable in dogfights too if needed. He wouldn't try too hard though - he would get away if he thought it was getting dangerous and got content with one kill, and I think he also wanted to keep himself in a stable condition mental-wise by not putting more pressure on himself. His workmanlike approach worked for him well. Also his opponents avoided him in dogfights because his  Bf-109 with the black tulip got famous/notorious.  Hartmann himself thought Hans-Joachim Marseille was the best fighter pilot.  The best Allied Ace was no doubt Ivan Kozhedub."
ShitWehraboosSay,3db57u,Sid_Burn,3,Wed Jul 15 03:15:24 2015 UTC,The top USN ace scored 16 of his 34 kills in TWO DAYS (3 sorties flown) of combat.  Another USN ace had multiple 4 kill missions.  That is certainly nothing to sneeze at.

ShitWehraboosSay,3d510d,Chris1396,9,Mon Jul 13 17:30:53 2015 UTC,"Google ""Wannsee Conference"".  Check the wording used.  Hitler did not order genocide.  Regarding the 6,000,000, it has been very well documented that the ""6,000,000"" figure was used for money-making ""humanitarian efforts"" well before WWII.  In fact, there is a shocking book (at least it was shocking to me!) called ""The First Holocaust"" by Don Heddesheimer, where he has photocopied many such newspaper articles claiming that ""6,000,000 jews"" were in danger of various horrors, and that money needed to be raised to save them, dating back to 40 years before the war.  Regarding the Zyklon-B ""gas chambers"", I urge you to read the Leuchter Report, as well as the Rudolf Report on the science.  Also, back in the 80s, a young jewish man named David Cole went to Auschwitz with some questions, and he made a video, available for viewing on Youtube.  You should check it out, and see what he discovered.    Or don't.  You're free to believe whatever you want, as am I.  You can ignore any and all facts in order to make the story fit what you've been told.  But as Albert Einstein said, ""Condemnation without investigation is the height of ignorance.""     This comment was upvoted to +70...I have no words   I used to believe what I had been taught in school, and by tv, until one day about seven years ago I saw that the plaque at Auschwitz[1] had been drastically changed, from 4 million, down to ""one and a half million...mainly jews."" And I got to thinking about the number. I did the math---you can too, anyone can, we have calculators right here on our computers---and found out it was ridiculous. We're expected to believe (and we do accept it, unless we investigate) that from the time of the Wannsee Conference on January 20, 1942 (the alleged date of the order to ""exterminate jews"") until Auschwitz was liberated by Russia on January 27, 1945, that Germans killed an average of 5440 jews, every day.

Although I would agree with Sabaton and say that the Germans that did their best to protect the path over the Elbe for other Germans, could be considered Heroes."
ShitWehraboosSay,3d2bge,Swardington,3,Mon Jul 13 02:09:25 2015 UTC,"From what I've heard people who do heroic things say, when they throw themselves in danger, they don't think much about long term consequences, they just do. And most of the times it's about people who are around them. A comrade, a stranger. Regarding the mood those people were in when they did a ""brave soldierly thing"", I don't believe the Axis soldiers were different.  I agree that in general the Allied soldiers still fought for a better cause and committed less atrocities, that's true. But it is not the results of action that makes people heroes - at least it's not that big of a factor. Because if the result of the actions is all that matter, we Vietnamese must venerate Hitler as a hero then, because by attacking other Western powers and weakening their economies, he allowed us and other colonized countries the chance to overthrow the colonial rule and decide one's own fates again. This is from the communist history books here, and the people who write those, thinking that nationalist socialism/fascism is the natural consequence of capitalism and the ultimate culmination of Western imperialism, will be the last people in the world who will be pro-Nazis or give the Nazis any credit. In other words, they think that Hitler was a robber who was born from a system of lesser robbers, a murderer who was produced by a world of lesser murderers - because Germany and Japan came late to the game of modern imperialism and lacked natural resources and advantaged natural geographic positions, to compete with other players in a dirty game, they just played dirtier.  Thus the Soviets are seen as heroic liberators without fault. But the capitalist soldiers? Less war crimes perhaps but still defenders of systems that oppressed people elsewhere (using the same logic you guys use to look down at those who say that many Wehrmacht soldiers also just thought of their country, their family and their comrades), who did not contribute to the ultimate victory much anyway and who probably would have not made protests either had they been sent to invade Asian and African countries like other Western soldiers who were given that less heroic job. Higher natural resistance to evil systems' commands and their own baser instinct? - We know first-hand from the invading colonial armies that they were not. Some, including higher officials, treated people here very well, but most were only too human (in a horrible way) not to be corrupted by war or not to take advantage of ""lesser people"" if their government allowed it.  WW2 gave us more legitimacy regarding fighting for our independence as well. Because after the war all Western powers suddenly decided that unprovoked aggressive wars and bad treatments of foreigners were horrible things, so we could tell them at the negotiating table: ""Then stop doing the same things to us!""  The French never said sorry either, for various things they had done here including the 1945 famine which they and the Japanese both helped a lot to turn into what it was. The Arabs once chanted ""No more monsieur, No more Mister, in heaven Allah, on earth Hitler"" - How disgusting of them!  Hitler was probably  a good thing to Allied leaders too. Thanks to him they could (and still can) divert their own people and the international public from their own countries' crimes. I always say that yes the Holocaust might be the worst thing ever, but the very disproportional representations of other genocides in the media is the true problem.  Same with ""true victim"" countries. For example, the Chinese government cries about the Rape of Nanking - and yes from a purely legal point of view it is a right thing. By itself it is also a right thing - but they would never make an example first by apologizing to their own people about Tiananmen or fixing other crimes they are still committing against their people. It is only to make their people have a sense of being united with the government in doing something together trying to gain a sense of moral/cultural superiority over foreigners/former enemies.   Here we Vietnamese often tell each other that the modern Germans or Japanese don't need to burden themselves with guilt too much like that (and yes in the case of the Japanese, it included atrocities against us), but perhaps in some regards it's a good thing, because they don't have a glorious history or good guy grandpas or anything they can rely psychologically on to create a sense of inherent superiority over foreigners, they have to work really hard and achieve many great things for their modern countries now, unlike us lazy Southerners. We have no guilt (very little if any. We are the invaded instead of the invader most of the times so we have a lot of war heroes to be proud of) and a lot of joie de vivre though. Most young people admire German and Japanese systems - perhaps again a way to divert ourselves because deep inside we know we won't trade our culture of leisure for their wealth or effectiveness."

ShitWehraboosSay,3d2bge,Chris1396,11,Sun Jul 12 23:34:29 2015 UTC,The whole thing about 'oh yeah actually Rommel tried to get rid of Hitler!' is so infuriating; apart from the fact that he was at best reluctantly complicit it's so annoying that the July Plot is seen as some noble anti-Nazi resistance rather than a bunch of Junkers trying to cheat the noose long after the war was obviously lost.
ShitWehraboosSay,3d2bge,TheD3rp,9,Mon Jul 13 10:43:45 2015 UTC,"I do believe Rommel is a military leader to be respected (to an extent), as he did stand up to the Nazis on more than one occasion, and was a brilliant officer in his own right, but no one who willingly fights for a regime like the Third Reich can be considered a hero of any kind, much less the anti-nazi idol he was made out to be. And from what I understand, he wasn't even directly involved in the bombing at Wolfsschanze, he just knew what was happening and didn't tell anyone, reluctantly, as you say."
ShitWehraboosSay,3d2bge,Chris1396,7,Mon Jul 13 12:38:15 2015 UTC,"a brilliant officer in his own right,   He was a great tactical commander. However, he had no idea how logistics worked and constantly disobeyed orders to dig in and instead went on the attack, so that's debatable."
ShitWehraboosSay,3d2bge,treebeard87,3,Mon Jul 13 16:42:54 2015 UTC,That's true. I suppose you can't really call someone a good officer if they constantly disobey orders... hmm...
ShitWehraboosSay,3d2bge,treebeard87,2,Mon Jul 13 17:21:45 2015 UTC,"I would even agree that he was not really anti-Nazi/anti-war and except the racist part, even quite the epitome of fascist ideals in some ways. After all without the racism/war crimes part, he was Garibaldi minus realistic political thinking (but plus naive idol-worshipping and crazy ideas regarding chivalry and expansionist militarism) and Garibaldi was Mussolini's model. If anything the post war myth that he was against it from the start but fought for Hitler halfheartedly is the most rubbish way one can excuse him ever. If Hitler, Churchill and a huge number of modern strongmen admire his personality even considering the way he changed sides (from what I’ve seen, people ‘high above’ like those who stick to their side, right or wrong), first of all it's because he always fought wholeheartedly for what he believed to be worthy of his service, whether that was for Hitler or against Hitler.    How modern media portray him as merely passively tolerant to the plot is beyond my understanding. What would he have done had he not been in the hospital the day the attack on Hitler happened was up to anyone’s guess. As for what was happening before that, I repost a recent post of mine here:    And yes, you can dislike him for his devotion towards Hitler. I have no protest there. I like romantic people (although I don't have the courage to become like them or have blind devotion towards anyone I meet in real life). (Again, this I agree with the Remy book) I also like that he loved Hitler for totally innocent reasons. Out of this love in the beginning he devoted his energy to what he believed to be Hitler's well meaning schemes, and sometimes seemed to try too hard to see the good in him. But he was never controlled whenever Hitler ordered him to do something bad. He tossed the Commando Order in fire knowing it was high treason (the strange thing is that he seemed to always forget these kinds of things immediately while other people, Allied and German, seemed to tremble even at the thought of opposing Hitler). And then when it finally was made clear to him that Hitler wasn't the person Rommel had always imagined him to be, he broke away from him despite all the emotional attachment. By 1944, it meant not only danger to himself and his family, but the very real chance that all fronts would collapse and Germany would fall into a civil war. He knew that killing Hitler had the very big chance to make bad things become worse and make himself the biggest villain in German history. Many anti Hitler people felt the same.  It was a moment that was not the kind reserved for men like von Kluge - who was no great man in his own estimation. Rundstedt decided the same, that a big decision here couldn't be made by old men who, unlike Rommel. , weren't known and loved by the people,   He chose to do things no other German commander dared. Not only he came to support the assassination, he made a lot of daring moves trying to bring other people into his plans. Notice the way people described his demeanor. ""Rommel just said to me out there that the Fuehrer and his clan had to be killed"". He had never met Manstein before, and he just went straight to where Manstein was swimming naked to introduce himself, and after a brief conversation, talked to him about committing high treason. Dietrich, Bittrich, Hausser, the SS guys who had all the reasons to dislike him in the world (he was not only a difficult leader to them, he also always made a big deal regarding their dirty nature and crimes), chose to follow him even against Hitler's orders  (Dietrich had been a hardcore Nazi and one of Hitler's most trusted men btw - Again, notice the demeanor, he made his request to Dietrich as if he was reading a ""solemn declaration""). It took nerves to just ask Rundstedt and von Schweppenburg, who had recently crossed swords with him regarding the Normandy plan, to join him against Hitler. FM von Kluge was sent to control Rommel by Hitler himself, and it took him days to side with Rommel regarding both the military situation and the separate peace plan.  In his book Remy concluded that no other German commander had such a sway over forces in the West. Rommel was the only chance to make it work. Same from civil leaders of the plot: 'You are the only one,' I said, 'who can prevent civil war in Germany. You must  lend your name to the movement.' I did not tell him that it was proposed to make him President of the Reich : the idea was not, in fact, suggested until I returned and had a talk with Goerdeler'  And Stauffenberg too ""We have no real field marshals any more..."". This remark did not apply to Rommel, whom Stauffenberg called ""a great leader"".  Ernst Juenger also felt that killing Hitler could lead to nothing positive at all and yet even he saw something in Rommel: ""The blow that felled Rommel on the Livarot Road deprived our plan of the only man strong enough to bear the terrible weight of war and civil war simultaneously—the only man with enough naivete to counter the frightful simplicity of those he was to attack.""  His charisma was his undoing btw. The Gestapo discovered his role because in his delirium (after a failed suicide), the military governor of France repeatedly called one name: Rommel   He himself said in the Rommel's Papers that if your emotions were false, people would know and they would not listen to such a leader. So either the people who followed him saw that despite his emotional attachment to Hitler,  he was really determined to save Germany and had huge faith in himself and also actual capability to realize that faith, or they simply decided that he was worthy of their faith no matter what.  His naivety is a marvel to me too. It wasn't just about Hitler, who was his idol. Your men committed illegal actions against his army and now you've fallen into his hand? Tell him it was the Maoris. Ask Brig Clifton link. He trusted people easily like that. Even when the attack was against his own person. Hitler's messengers of death showed him evidences that his CoS Speidel had betrayed him. His reaction: telling his son Manfred that he should take care of Frau Speidel if her husband was killed. The naivety seemed to have a spreading effect. Manfred and Lucie, initially believing that Speidel helped to kill Rommel, came to trust him again after the war despite all the reasons to believe that he was guilty."

But you cannot reduce their motives to ""cheating the noose"". First, most were not in high enough positions to worry about that. Second, by 1944, no matter what you can say about their motives, assassinating Hitler still meant huge risks for themselves and their loved ones - the Nazi concept of Sippenhaft was not something one should take lightly. And it was not like they were going to be treated like heroes by the German public, of which the majority were still worshipping Hitler. They knew well the possible consequences of creating a new ""Stabbed in the back"" myth. The leaders did see that things could go beyond wrong even if they succeeded: all fronts might collapse and a civil war was very much possible - I don't know many historians today who would argue against that."

Even Tigers and Tiger 2's had little issue getting moving, and when they did it wasn't because the motor wasn't maximizing torque. When you're bogged down in the mud it's rarely a torque problem but a traction one and more torque is just going to make it worse.  You can get rid of the clutch and transmission but in it's place you're putting in generators and electric motors so it's not less complex but arguably more so. Never mind the size of things.

Fact: The success attributed to the SS is mostly based on their war diaries (Tigers in Combat). The diaries had little to do with reality (Tigers in Normandy). Even the Wehrmacht slashed the claims of the SS in half when estimating their performance, and Schneider’s research shows that even that was an optimistic figure. For example, Wittmann’s famous battle at Villers-Bocage where he is claims 20 kills only had 7 to his name. His victory was blown out of proportion by SS propaganda, since they were desperate for a tank ace among their own, routinely assigning an entire unit’s accomplishments to one tank/crew. Most people focus on the three SS divisions that were LAH, Reich, and Totenkopf, which were equivalent to a Wehrmacht division at the best of times. The remaining SS divisions were barely Volkssturm quality, assigned to rear line duties such as executing civilians and fighting partisans. (Credit: Zinegata, Brickfight)"

The reason why Soviet gear performed so poorly in the middle east has nothing to do with the gear and everything to do with who was employing it and how.   There are a myriad of reasons why the Iraqi army is a mess (the complete illegitimacy of their successive governments and barely contained at best sectarian conflicts would be chief among them) but gear isn't one of them.  Put it this way. The Iraqis in Soviet tanks were defeated by a massive armored spearhead with uncontested air superiority. Decades later, the Iraqi army,equipped with the same American tanks which defeated them before, were defeated by some religious revivalists in pickup trucks.  Does this mean the Abrams is the world's worst tank, or does it perhaps mean the Iraqi army is the problem?"
ShitWehraboosSay,3d0c3y,EvanHarper,8,Sun Jul 12 20:14:07 2015 UTC,"The classic article here is Victory Misunderstood, which argues that the U.S. advantage in technology only resulted in lopsided victories because it took away the Iraqis' margin for mistakes, not because it made the fight terribly uneven from the beginning. At 73 Easting (his main test case,) the Americans' powerful thermal sights let them blast the Iraqi defenders from very long ranges but only because their tanks were incompetently sited in above-ground revetments. If they had been in well-hidden turret-down positions they would likely have remained invisible until opening fire at their own, chosen range, negating the technological advantage. He also points out that much Coalition equipment was not nearly as imposing as the M1s – obsolescent Marine M60s and thin-skinned Bradleys, Warriors, and LAVs all went through heavy engagements without suffering serious losses – and that OPFOR at the National Training Center routinely trounces technologically superior units with their simulated ""T-72s"" and ""BMPs.""

It wouldn't have mattered if they had Baneblade tanks if they were employed incorrectly and mostly abandoned.   It's worth noting that the Israelis captured T-54/55s by the thousand and were employing them into the 90s (IIRC they still use the chassis for APCs). They performed some upgrades and changed the gun for logistics reasons, but in Israeli service the tanks performed quite well. Israel had plenty of access to the NATO arsenal, but didn't see the need to upgrade them for a long time.   Also while today's Iraqi army is a different force from the one in 1991, a lot of the underlying problems have not been fixed. Nour al-Maliki purged tons of well trained career officers and NCOs for sectarian reasons, replacing them with incompetent, but religiously and politically loyal lackeys, and the morale of the force is still incredibly poor.   In the hands of a force with good leadership and morale (the Israeli example above), Soviet gear has performed quite well. The same could be said of Soviet aircraft over North Vietnam. The North Vietnamese were competently lead and had good morale, and so were able to do rather well with their MiGs, whereas in the services of a lot of other air forces, they failed miserably."

The Iraqis did not have ""monkey models."" They had T-72M and T-72M1 with some indigenous armor and fire control upgrades; I explained it here. This materiel was the same as what Polish and Czech units fielded in 1989, and only slightly below the standard of T-72B, which was the most advanced Soviet model that began to come online only at the very end of the Cold War. Most of the T-72s that NATO would have faced ca. 1983, at the height of the late Cold War, were almost exactly the same as what Iraq had in 1991.  This trend to explain away the repeated failures of Soviet export equipment as near-useless ""monkey models"" seems to stem to Viktor Suvorov, who can only be described as a dishonest anti-Soviet propagandist; he mixes small amounts of his own limited professional military knowledge with rumors, exaggerations, wild speculation, and outright nonsense. In the 1980s he geared his writing towards ""Team B"" style ""the Soviets are way better than anybody realizes and we have to massively increase military spending"" ideology; since 1991 he has drifted into outright Hitler apologetics and become the darling of East European nationalist/fascist types.  TL;DR look up what specific equipment was being used, don't just assume ""non-Soviet = monkey model = worthless imitation of real Soviet equipment"""
ShitWehraboosSay,3d0c3y,EvanHarper,3,Sun Jul 12 17:50:18 2015 UTC,"The M is the shitty export version, although the ""monkey model"" is most likely a backronym. And if by ""just below the standard of the T-72B"" you mean ""nothing alike it,"" you may very well be correct. The T-72M had a RHA turret instead of a composite one that appeared in Soviet models and most importantly, it didn't have any ERA (which practically doubles a T-72's armor). The T-72M1 was the exact same thing as the T-72M, except for a 16mm sheet welded to the glacis. The T-72B (you're being dishonest here, by the way, as early T-72Bs with Kontakt-1 were different from the '89 model T-72B with Kontakt-5) was an entirely different beast with a much better gun, ability to use guided missiles, a newer engine, a significantly improved fire control system, 3 more tons of armor, and most importantly, ERA.  How you can say they were even close to being comparable is beyond me.  Oh, and Soviet/Warsaw Pact tankers would be using DU 3VBM13 rounds, not steel 3VBM3."
ShitWehraboosSay,3d0c3y,Batyrsik,0,Thu Jul 16 06:50:26 2015 UTC,"I know that T-72M/M1 is what people insist on calling ""monkey model."" And no, it is not a backronym, it is a term alleged to have been used by the Soviets according to Viktor Suvorov who is highly untrustworthy.  The term ""monkey model"" should be removed from your lexicon. It is a lazy way to assert that Soviet equipment outside of Soviet hands is crap non-reflective of real Soviet equipment, without looking at the specifics of what exactly was different.   The T-72M1 was the exact same thing as the T-72M, except for a 16mm sheet welded to the glacis.   Wrong, wrong, wrong. T-72M had the weak all-steel turret. T-72M1 had the composite turret identical to T-72A. You can verify this even visually. This was the single most important difference in the move to T-72M1 model.    Most of the T-72s that NATO would have faced ca. 1983...   you're being dishonest here, by the way, as early T-72Bs with Kontakt-1 were different from the '89 model T-72B   Ah, I see. I'm dishonest by not including 1989 model equipment when comparing tanks ca. 1983. T-72B must have been equipped with time travel device in addition to all the other upgrades.   entirely different beast with a much better gun   Virtually identical gun. 2A46M instead of 2A46-1. Same ammunition, barrel length, velocity – supposedly slightly better accuracy due to improved manufacturing, tighter tolerances. ""Much better"" – total nonsense. It did have ATGM capability, I'll give you that.   a newer engine   V-84-1 instead of V-84, 840 hp instead of 780, 7.5% increase. To go along with 7% increase in weight. Entirely different beast.   a significantly improved fire control system   True!   3 more tons of armor   True!   and most importantly, ERA   Kontakt-1 was just becoming available in 1983 (West didn't know about it until 1984) and being first-generation type offered minimal protection to APFSDS which is what knocked out the overwhelming majority of tanks in the Gulf. Kontakt-5 of course is better and would have made some difference in 1991, though given the tactical situation (which was not the fault of Soviet equipment ofc) it would have just been a matter of having to expend more ammunition.   How you can say they were even close to being comparable   Gee, I don't know, maybe because your ""most important"" advance was negated in tit-for-tat fashion in only a few years, by improved 120mm ammunition? And had gaps in coverage amounting to something like half of the frontal area – increasing as the armor expends itself and leaves more gaps?  Seriously, this is pathetic. By changing the date of the comparison from 1983 to 1989 (T-72A to T-72B+Kontakt-5,) you get marginal increases in firepower and moderate increases in FC and protection. You do not get some kind of quantum leap that negates all comparison. What I said is exactly accurate – Iraq's best tanks were not very far below the standard of latest Soviet stuff, and were certainly not ""worthless dogshit monkey models nothing like SOVIET STRONK TANK""  Fucking Warsawboos, man."
ShitWehraboosSay,3d0c3y,EvanHarper,3,Thu Jul 16 16:38:43 2015 UTC,"First off, that's the literal definition of a backronym. The M in T-72M cannot stand for monkey since the word for it in Russian is ""obezyana,"" a word that clearly begins with O and not M.   No, you were trying to imply that the war in Europe would go the same as in Iraq. To do that, you compared 1991 US technology to sub-1983 USSR technology - M1A1s instead of M1s against T-72Ms instead of T-72As or Bs. Giving 10 more years of technology development to the Americans is not at all representative of what would happen.   Virtually identical gun. 2A46M instead of 2A46-1. Same ammunition, barrel length, velocity – supposedly slightly better accuracy due to improved manufacturing, tighter tolerances. ""Much better"" – total nonsense.   Better accuracy, twice the range, ATGM capability, better barrel life, exact same thing, right?   Entirely different beast.   Yes, because now you have a more heavily armored, advanced tank that didn't lose any mobility compared to the previous models.   first-generation type offered minimal protection to APFSDS which is what knocked out the overwhelming majority of tanks in the Gulf.    Since we're talking about 1983, the USA would be fielding M1s with inferior rifled 105mm cannons. It would be all the USA would be able to use until 1986 when M1A1s came into service (that's what they used in Iraq too). Finally, an often-overlooked bit is that during the Gulf War, the vast majority of tanks were destroyed by ATGMs, which the Soviets had superiority in.   Gee, I don't know, maybe because your ""most important"" advance was negated in tit-for-tat fashion in only a few years, by improved 120mm ammunition?   Negated? You're giving NATO way too much credit. There's a Jane's IDR article from 1997 (not the fake one from 2007 that has been making the rounds) that states Kontakt-5 worked beautifully against the M829 round, which was the best that the USA had until the mid-90s. It's what originally caused them to develop the M829A2.   And had gaps in coverage amounting to something like half of the frontal area   Have you ever heard of all-or-nothing armor? Same concept. For example, you don't need to put ERA on the areas where the round will just hit the side armor, etc.   Seriously, this is pathetic. By changing the date of the comparison from 1983 to 1989    Oh gee, so we should just compare 1991 USA tech to 1983 Soviet tech. That's much more fair!   you get marginal increases in firepower and moderate increases in FC and protection.   Oh yeah, almost doubled armor is moderate. Also, significant improvements in accuracy don't real, ATGMs don't real, fire control don't real, nothing is real! There's no parity, magic M1A1s were immediately superior to anything the USSR had!  USAboos are the worst out there. They will huff and puff and jerk and jerk and still fail to prove anything, but hell if they won't just claim victory anyway."
ShitWehraboosSay,3d0c3y,TitusBluth,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:54:44 2015 UTC,"Ahhhh, now I see. You're angry because you baselessly assume:   you were trying to imply that the war in Europe would go the same as in Iraq. To do that, you compared 1991 US technology to sub-1983 USSR technology   This is nonsense. I've already cited a paper in this thread arguing that Iraq lost so badly because of combination of slightly worse technology and major skill gap, and pointed out that OPFOR ""T-72s"" and ""BMPs"" regularly thrash their opponents.  Since you're so anxious: at no time during the Cold War was NATO's ability to stop a Warsaw Pact advance without going nuclear ever more than a very chancy proposition; for much of that era, in fact, it was clear that they could not have done so. In late 1970s-~1980 American tank park was seriously qualitatively inferior to WP opponents – M60A1 against T-64B and T-72A would have been no fun at all.  Now, have I sated your Russian inferiority complex enough that we can continue?  ""Monkey model"" is not backronym or acronym, it has nothing to do with the ""M"" in ""T-72M."" It is invention of Viktor Suvorov, wildly untrustworthy author who has given generations of Soviet armor fans ready-made excuse to dismiss all failures of Soviet equipment. He even claimed that USSR was keeping existence of non-monkey models secret from allies which was utter fantasy. Accidentally or otherwise he conflated legitimate facts of export models with some story about ""real Soviet equipment"" being incomparably superior, which it never was. It was in most cases a few years ahead.  Better accuracy at ranges where they couldn't have found targets would not have helped Iraqis in 1991. Longer barrel life is an economy measure with no tactical significance. What you said about M829A2 introduced 1993 was exactly what I was referring to. There is no ""nothing"" penetration of a very tight tank that does not separate ammo and crew compartment; and anyway you can see at a glance that Kontakt-5 gaps include mantlet & around mantlet, turret ring, etc which are hardly inessential zones. Same site you just approved as a source is where I got 50% figure of Kontakt-5 coverage. ""All-or-nothing"" is false rationalization. It would be better to say that T-72B+Kontakt-5 hit with M829 projectile means that ""all-or-nothing"" of the tank is destroyed, with equal chances. Which is why Kontakt-5 ERA is not a revolutionary game-changer under any circumstances.  Soviet tanks are not bad. Iraq's Soviet tanks (at least its best ones) were not bad. T-72M1 was not a bad tank, it was not a ""monkey model,"" it was certainly not ""dogshit."" It was a fairly even match for the Marine Corps' M60A3s, maybe even a better tank. Iraq's defeat does not support the idea that Soviet equipment is lousy because it wasn't primarily caused by deficient equipment. But nor does it illustrate failure of ""useless monkey model tanks."""

Some more   Don’t care about communist propaganda and that shit, but a lot of these seems like a total bullshit to me. By these “facts” you could say that Germans were complete noobs, idiots and their tanks were the worst out there. I’m not saying they were superior in everything, but this whole article made them look really worse than the worst. One would ask himself how they managed to that much in ww2 and not lose in 2 days to allies.   And another one   Another great propaganda article from our local fanatical communist.   OK this is the last one I swear   What a bullshit “Communist” propaganda article! Its not only what you write, its the way you write also. This has nothing to do with Myths, its simple russish propaganda and you poor boy beliefe it.   I lied :(   Ensign, you are nothing but a communist pig.   Even the non-Wehraboos are fucking terrible people. Here's one guy on the Abrams:   ‘S pretty decent from what I gather – modern armies aren’t in the habit of building bad multi-million-dollar MBTs – but yeah, curbstomping a few worn-out Monkey Models in Sandniggeristan doesn’t add up to terribly convincing bragging rights.   Obviously.   You keep using the word fact when you should be using opinion. Obviously every retard is allowed to post here.   This guy plays that anthropomorphic tank pseudo-anime game and someone just implied his waifu is a dirty slut:   Oh see who is barking its EnsignExpendable, our beloved soviet propaganda komissar, keep up the work saying every german achievement is a lie, so much butthurt are you just jealous.  You have all a false reflection of wwII cause of this stupid game, there were no mighty >IS3-ISX, T54/62, american T-28/29/30/32/34/95, M103, T110EX, british chieftain, centurion or high tier french tanks who fought in wwII.  Just only BTs, T34s, IS-IS2, Su-76/85/100/122/152, ISU, Shermans, Hellcats, M8 Greyhound, Wolverine, Jackson, Churchills, Crusaders, Cromwells, Archers and a lot of other papertanks who suffered a lot of losses against such an underpowered and weak warmachinery of one nation, the germans, yeah that makes sense at all being better as a german with own shitty tanks against a lot of more tanks in numbers of the other nations which were all superior sure…  I knew it that u have to freak out when u rarely read something good about germans on this blog u have to float it with soviet propaganda and all this BS, for example like Staudegger, german gunsights, innovative designs like pantehr who influenced a lot of post ww2 tanks of french, german and others till the late 20th centuary, oh and guess who is bulding the guns vor Abrams…   FILTHY SLAVCOMMIES CANNOT INTO ENGINEERING   because T55 is a postwar design and soviets always had their own ideas on how to build a tank. Russian tanks are always little in height, less weight, little turret And just because theyresemble each other doesnt mean that their internals are the same  All allies studied captured german tanks and i hardly doubt that they would admit that parts of their tanks are inspired by german tanks. Maybe they did maybe they didnt.  Ohh and look after seing the german Stg44 the Soviets suddenly inveted the AK47. Of course they werent inspired by ZE GERMANS it was all due to tem being super smart…. They just swaped out the mechanism (similar to the SKS if im not mistaken) but the basic idea for an assault rifle was copied from the Stg44. Michail Kalashnikov can denie that all he wants    By this guy's logic, wouldn't the first MBT would actually be the FT-17?   All MBT’s, beacause panther could be seen as a first MBT (decent armor + decent mobility + decent firepower for all roles)   Playing online game = actually fighting against Germany   Stalinboos gonna hate. Nothing new here. They will do anything to justify nerfing the piss out of German tanks. Funny how the people who actually fought against Germany say the complete opposite of these Internet kiddies.   Japan, Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria and Finland, not to mention a bunch of occupation governments and foreign volunteers, would like a word with this guy.   And again this “anti myth crap”.  Im always asking myself wy the russians, usa, brits, france etc. needed 5 fucking years and 20million death soldiers to stop a single country…   I -think- this guy is saying his precious HitlerHeer would defeat any modern army, but his English she is not so gut.  For the record, I'm pretty sure there are -police forces- today that would kick the crap out of the goddamn WW2 Wehrmacht and be done in time to violate my civil rights before knocking off to the pub.   Oh yeah ? – you are ridiculous – nowadays every general worldwide would take some german WWII wehrmacht or even better SS divisions with a kiss – and rape all those modern day so called “elite units”.   B-but muh kill ratios! Allied fanboy propaganda! ALLIED FANBOY PROPAGANDA!   This post is some total load of allied fanboy propaganda BS. Where is the myth that German tanks were not reliable and broke down all the time?  Tiger II can be frontally penetrated by 85mm guns at 300 meters? When was a tiger II frontally penetrated IN combat, by ANY gun? Oh yeah, NEVER.  Soviet optics being the best quality sourced to a -single- quote at Aberdeen? Right.  Panther G final drives do not last for only 150 km. Maybe the first Ausf A models deployed at Kursk.  Germans having padded kill ratios (shared). Like the allies didn’t? Look at allied air victories for instance, especially in the Pacific the Americans were especially overcounting.  It’s perfectly reasonable to say the Germans had an advantage being largely on the defensive, but to surmise that their kill-loss ratio was not impressive approaches the realm of total absurd history revisionism. Even the humble StuG III’s achieved over a 3:1 ratio on average.  So much BS nonsense with the OP I could be ranting all night.   No, you see, the Germans only looted, raped and murdered their way through Eastern Europe to protect us from the Soviets!   Yeap, the soviets soldiers were some true gentlemen: raping and killing civilians in East Europe countries…. You commie lovers make me vomit.   CIA (and literally every serious source on the face of the planet) is biased in favor of the Soviets.   “Myth: Soviet Cold War era armour was abysmal, and the Americans had nothing to fear from it. Fact: The CIA disagrees.” -Yes, of course we should trust the main propagandist for keeping the cold war running about the danger from the east! Short version, CIA is not the most trustworthy nor an expert on Russion armor.   Tiger II not invincible = Anti-German, you RACISTS!   Anti-German content: Check Russian propaganda: Check Par for the author’s agenda: Check   Some guy had an idea that vaguely reminds me of German tactical practice = Blitzkrieg was totes the official doctrine of the Wehrmacht, you guys!!!   Blitzkrieg was not a doctrine? Lol. The lightning war or “fast war” is older than the ww2. Montecuccoli and Prince Eugene of Savoy (1663) described in the military tradition, fearing of the multifront war, they recognized the campaigns must be swift, fast and short. A long war will bleed out the army, and the solider’s spirit, destroys the country and kills the population. Clausewitz summerized the Napoleonic wars, wich made him well known in military history. Moltke and Schlieffen followed these doctrines and between the two world wars Guderian followed their footstepps. Although this wasn’t apllyable in the first world war beacouse the trench wars, the idea of the “fast war” lived on.   I'm about 60% through the thread and pretty much hit my daily limit of unmitigated bullshit. If someone else wants to pick this up, fine."

To be a bit fair to the guy, the whole ""Panther was the first MBT"" didn't come from online sources.  Wargaming.net held a tanking roundtable called ""Operation Think Tank"" where some of the foremost Armour historians in the world (Steven Zaloga, Harry Yeide, Hilary Doyle, David Fletcher, Rob Griffin, Kenneth Estes) were invited to talk about tanks for two hours.  A member of the audience asked what could be considered the first MBT and the almost unanimous answer from the panel was the Panther.  So that's where that comes from."
ShitWehraboosSay,3d0c3y,potato_delusions,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:08:58 2015 UTC,"I've heard Panther, T-54 and Centurion.   My problem with all of these is that the generally accepted definition of MBT is a tank that fulfills both the Medium and Heavy tank roles, and all of those were built and deployed concurrently with true Heavies. In my book they're just big Mediums until you retire the Heavies or at least use the big Mediums as Heavies in your regular tank doctrine.  More relevantly to what this guy is saying, he claims an MBT is just a tank with ""decent"" armor, mobility and firepower ""for all roles"" which I'm going to be charitable here and interpret as anti-tank and anti-infantry. The problem with this mode of thought is that relative to when they were introduced there are quite a few earlier tanks that could make that claim, including T-34, some of the heavier Cruiser designs, etc. If you really wanted to comically push a point to where it's obviously absurd, the FT-17 was (in practice) about as mobile as anything else in service at the time, decently protected against shell fragments and small arms fire (with the state of anti-tank weapons this was all you needed) and mounted a machine gun or light cannon, either of which would have been perfectly adequate against German tanks of the era... because for all intents and purposes the Germans had no tanks."

It's totally disingenuous to dismiss the T-34s reliability problems by attacking the Aberdeen trials; besides the fact that it's extremely hard to verify his claims about those trials being flawed, and requires us to believe that people like Zaloga have gotten it all wrong, that is hardly the only line of evidence demonstrating how bad T-34 was through the period when it was supposedly turning the tide and hounding inferior German tanks to destruction. They literally went into action with spare transmissions lashed to their rear decks as a matter of course. Trials as late as mid-1943 found that 90 to 93% of T-34s randomly sampled for endurance testing broke down before their specified 300 km limit, although this was finally fixed by December. Histories of tank units in the first couple years of the Patriotic war are litanies of breakdowns and operational losses; one reads of a mechanized corps essentially self-dissolving into a mass of stragglers after a mere 100 km march along good roads in the rear area.  Seriously, T-34 was not ready for prime time for the first two years of the war. The fact that those tanks which did make it into battle sometimes shocked Wehrmacht commanders with their near-impregnability to 37mm and 50mm fire ought to be taken in the same light as claims about ""unstoppable"" Tigers and Panthers; it's a cherry-picked comparison that ignores massive operational deficiencies in the weapons system as a whole."

The Soviets were essentially slapping together tanks as fast as they could, with the bare minimum of 'polish' because it was generally expected that their service life would be measured in weeks...if not days or hours depending on the location.  After 1942, though, they started to implement a bit of quality control since their tanks were lasting a bit longer.  And they weren't busy relocating their factories.  That's part of the reason I've heard given for some of the performance issues and comments about poor welding at Aberdeen.  The tanks they got were 1942 production models, essentially thrown together with no regard for long-term usage.  They were meant to be expendable."

The operation was named after 18th–19th century Georgian Prince Pyotr Bagration, general of the Imperial Russian Army who was mortally wounded at the Battle of Borodino.  The operation resulted in the almost complete destruction of an entire German army group, with the loss of Army Group Centre's Fourth Army, Third Panzer Army and Ninth Army. It is considered the most calamitous defeat experienced by the German armed forces during the Second World War.   By the end of the operation most of the western Soviet Union had been liberated and the Red Army had achieved footholds in Romania and Poland. German losses eventually numbered well over half a million men killed or wounded, even higher than the toll at Verdun in 1916.   The Soviet armies directly involved in Operation Bagration were the 1st Baltic Front under Army General Ivan Bagramyan, the 1st Belorussian Front commanded by Army General Konstantin Rokossovsky, the 2nd Belorussian Front commanded by Colonel-General G. F. Zakharov, and the 3rd Belorussian Front commanded by Colonel-General Ivan Chernyakhovsky.  The Red Army practiced the concept of Soviet deep battle and maskirovka. Operation Bagration diverted German mobile reserves to the central sectors, removing them from the Lublin-Brest, Lvov–Sandomierz area, enabling the Soviets to undertake the Lvov–Sandomierz Offensive  and Lublin–Brest Offensive.  This allowed the Red Army to reach the Vistula river and Warsaw, which in turn put Soviet forces within striking distance of Berlin, conforming to the concept of Soviet deep operations — striking deep into the enemy's strategic depths.

First, check out the colors. Unlike the stupid monochrome insignia-festooned uniforms with the clashing helmets, the clothes in this photo present an interesting palette of colors, ranging from black leather boots, through a dark gray hat, and coats and trousers in warm earth colors. There's no silly eagles-and-thunderbolts insignia in evidence (the best way to look gauche? Obvious, excessive branding), just a discreet red star indicating their affiliation: these guys are obviously secure in the team they belong to. The polished leather boots give you a sense of care and formality, while the faux fur collars and hats add playful luxuriousness to the outfit.  And here's the best part: These guys know how to accessorize. The PPSh (again, in black and warm earth tones), handled with casual ease, conveys a clear message: Suck it, Woody Guthrie.

ShitWehraboosSay,3cr0s7,CIV_QUICKCASH,21,Fri Jul 10 03:10:56 2015 UTC,"Nazis were human.  Hitler was human. Himmler was human.  They all took dumps, laughed, loved, cried, etc.  They were all humans.  Some were incredibly evil, others lower down went along through societal pressure or in the name of advancing their career.  All humans being the same, it's important to remember that most of us are capable of such horrors in similar circumstances.  It's also important to remember that the reasons people did those things aren't excuses for doing them.  The failure to grasp that difference --  between humanizing and apologizing -- is what lands most comments here.  Everyone does everything, good or bad, ""because reasons"", but simply having reasons doesn't remove the guilt.  The extenuating circumstances that people use to excuse the German military from guilt (or at the very least severely reduce it) wouldn't remotely hold up in a murder trial for an individual.  If you murder someone to get a promotion, because of peer pressure, because you were drunk, or because you simply hated that person, in all cases you're going to jail for the murder.  They might not all carry the same sentence, but in every cause you're guilty of murdering someone.  But using Wehraboo logic, almost all of those make it okay.  This is the gigantic problem I have with the Wehraboo's definition of ""humanizing Germans.""  Accepting that Germans during WW2 were human beings does not necessitate letting the Wehrmacht off the hook as a degenerate, genocidal, murderous tool of an army for a racist totalitarian party when they were told in graphic detail what their goals were in the war."
ShitWehraboosSay,3cr0s7,Repulsive_Anteater,9,Fri Jul 10 11:49:09 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, pretty much all of Nazi leadership was based around either loyalty to Hitler or loyalty to the ideology (how much you hate Jews/Slavs/Roma/etc). Of course the goal of the war was a racial remapping of Europe and of course the people who were most devoted to that were holding leadership positions, but saying that some (literally) faceless soldiers who died a continent away from their hometown was equally as responsible as Himmler because they didn't burn their draft card and join the resistance is bad history in itself, and not to mention stupid.   It pisses me off that some people ignore the fact that the rest of the world didn't have their benefits of hindsight and believe that they wouldn't do the same in that situation, because that completely ignores the entire reason the war happened. The romanticized ""just say no"" or concept that resistance was acceptable if only everyone did it, forgets that the entire social structure of the Third Reich revolved around loyalty to the concept of preventing resistance and also carrying out the Holocaust/general genocidal Nazi war plans. Yes the average soldier probably knew exactly what was going on after enough fighting, however many weren't in positions to resist by that point. Denmark and Rommel's armies were exceptions, not rules. Both had resistance to war crimes in their leadership, and such resistance wasn't taken very kindly by higher leadership. The ruthlessness that the Nazis had against ideological enemies was what brought the vast majority of soldiers to carry out the crimes they did. Ignoring that ruthlessness, by acting as if WW2 was some walk through a park or seeing it through the lens of some high school communist longing to be a member of the Polish resistance ignores every lesson that can be learned from this period in history, what pushed normal people, not faceless monsters, to that point."

One example includes ""not much of a difference between flying in the Nazi German air force and serving in the SS"" (I haven't done an analysis of every single pilot's motives, however one branch was designed to win wars while the other was designed to actively carry out genocide. Yes you can argue that helping Nazi Germany win the war in any way was being complicit in genocide, but at that point you may as well start getting onto any German citizen who read Mein Kampf and kept paying their taxes). Another says any soldier who was even aware of the war crimes being committed was technically complicit, and while that is true it kinda ignores the gravity of how evil the Nazis were (and how it wouldn't take very long for any soldiers to become aware of the objectives of their leadership) by suggesting that every soldier is complicit in war crimes unless they ""reported such crimes or done something about it"", which I'll agree is nice more just idealism than anything.

The problem in this hypothetical is assuming that 1943 Germany could simultaneously afford to continue the war effort while pouring resources into an atomic bomb. Even if they did, there's no way they could deliver it to the front without killing their own soldiers. Sneaking a bomb into Russia is possible but rather hard given that 1943 marked the beginning of a Soviet counter offensive.  Ostensibly they could attempt to smuggle it on U-boat, but again it's very hard to see how the atomic bomb would help.  Assuming they replaced the V-2 with an atomic bomb that worked, it still wouldn't help given that atomic bombs aren't very good defensive weapons. Perhaps it'd make a zone of denial but that would only delay the inevitable. Given that Germany didn't even have a place to test a hypothetical atomic bomb or create a delivery system that wouldn't kill their own soldiers, the Atomic bomb wouldn't have been very useful given that the delivery system would compromise any atomic bomb.  Plus I mean how would they reproduce it if they lost it? An Atomic bomb as an asset is only good if you have the ability to deliver the payload safely to it's destination.

That's assuming that the Western Allies are feeling generous, and don't have a good grasp on German war crimes.  Nazi Germany was so far away from being able to produce an atomic bomb that it wouldn't be able to match the power of the US and would probably collapse relatively soon after due to economic or internal political problems.

From what's been gone over a hundred times, it really depends how. Nazi Germany, as much as people don't want to admit it in this subreddit, was really great at fighting wars and toppling opposing governments. At everything else, not so much. The reason that they were so effective at the whole invading everyone surrounding them thing is because that was the only thing they did. Sure there was funding to arts and infrastructure, however it all was intended to cement the Nazi party's control over Germany and occupied lands, so they could be more efficient at invading and exploiting surrounding territories. And I want to stress the exploiting part. The reason Nazi Germany could keep funding their militarism and expansion is because every single invasion was very profitable in the short term. The Nazis were notorious for looting nearly anything of value that they could take, and bringing it back home to fund their war machine. And this extends beyond just natural resources. The Nazis were the most widespread users of slave labor in recent history, and such labor most definitely was beneficial to the Nazi regime.   The big problem with this is it's not sustainable. And by not sustainable, it's not in a ""oil is going to be near depleted in probably a hundred years"" kind of way, rather a ""the economy is going to experience its worst collapse in history if we avoid invading another country every six months"" kind of unsustainable. Also as I mentioned, after invasion these countries were exploited, having their minorities rounded up for slave labor and their governments forced to aid Nazi Germany in other wars/invasion occurring elsewhere.   Not only is that not very sustainable economically, but that's a really shitty way to make friends. Especially considering Nazi ideology revolved around exterminating or enslaving the vast majority of the Eastern half of Europe. This becomes painfully evident during Operation Barbarossa, when Hitler was more concerned with reshaping the cultural/political makeup of the USSR and Eastern Europe during the invasion, rather than actually trying to beat Russia, which there may have been a chance at him doing so.   As for points of divergence, generally it's considered a good idea to not get caught up in Greece and Yugoslavia, and invade Russia six weeks earlier than in our timeline, on schedule. This obviously gives time for important gains to be made before the winter of 1941/42 when the Blitzkrieg starts to loose momentum and everything turns to shit. I've heard a few people make claims that the mud that was covering Russia during May would've actually hampered the Axis invasion and given the Soviets more time to prepare, however that specific timing was in most ways perfect, and probably a good idea considering at this point Nazi Germany had already established to the rest of the world that they invade just about anything that touches their borders, making more fighting inevitable. Stalin however, refused to believe that Germany would strike first, and decided that right then would be a good time to start reorganizing his army (by killing off just about all of its leadership).   After the slight advantage of time, more importantly Nazi Germany needed to not turn the Eastern Front into what it was. As I was saying earlier, Hitler was much more interested in killing off or enslaving the entirety of the Slavic race than he was interested in defeating the USSR. This leads to a few interesting situations were there were hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of potential Soviet defectors who would rather fight under Stalin's totalitarian regime because the Wehrmacht/SS would execute them if they tried defecting to Hitler's totalitarian regime. Even with Nazi Germany blatantly attempting the genocide of all Slavic ethnic groups, there were plenty of examples of collaboration simply because Stalin's USSR was so awful. Yet Nazi Germany had no intentions on benefiting from being liberators, and were very quick to establish themselves as conquerors.   If you want Nazi Germany to achieve any or their war goals, you need to take the Nazi part out of it. Throughout history almost every successful empire is based off religious and ethnic tolerance to some extent. Hitler wanted to build an empire based on the exact opposite of that, and he wanted to do it in a decade. He wanted his country to fight a war alone against the rest of the world, and then achieve crushing victory, and that simply wasn't possible. Even if Nazi Germany was able to topple the government's of Russia and the United Kingdom, there'd be such widespread rebellion and resistance that eventually the Third Reich would collapse just the same. Sorry if that got a little off topic, but it's difficult to answer this question because it's difficult to find a way for Nazi Germany to win WW2. If you're curious on some of their plans if they somehow did win, I'd suggest reading about Generalplan Ost. Really captures the insanity of Nazi leadership that I'm trying to get across."

But it's not like it's completely worthless now, it's still a decent vehicle, just slow and cumbersome.   Er wait, I mean, the Ratte was the pinnacle of engineering and allied bomber raids would have been stopped because there would be complex electromagnetic protective fields over the factories that were set up by the most intelligent scientists and engineers of the war, German ones, and any plane that would come near would instantly crash to the ground, there would also obviously be loads of fighter support just in case, who are impervious to the electromagnetic field because they're made of the special German materials that aren't affected by the frequency of it."

(Paraphrase of cable from Cairo to Milid, No 1131, June 15 1942)  Crews loud in their praise of American Mediums. I talked with tank commanders who claimed 8 German tanks to their credit, and whose tank had been hit as high as 12 times by 50mm and even 88mm. (Paraphrase of cable from Cairo to Milid no 1090, Part II, June 1 1942.  Unofficial – American medium tank is reported as magnificent. Crews have great confidence in them. So far as reported, mediums have not been penetrated from the front. By maneuver of artillery and 75mm of medium tanks 88mm A/T guns have been silenced. (Paraphrase of cable from Cairo to Milid no 1076, Part II, Mey 30 1942)   And so much for even the later (Ausf. F2/G+) Panzer IV's supposed superiority   There is concrete evidence that the enemy tanks, including the special PzKw IV (with the long-barrelled higher velocity 75mm gun) has been destroyed up to ranges of 2,000 yards. All troops are indicating that there should be more Shermans sent out at the earliest opportunity.    How the hell did the Panzer IV even get better ratings than the Sherman for mobility, firepower and armour? Its sustained road speed was 25 kph and its power to weight was lower than some heavy tanks. Comparing flat armour to flat armour, its front mantlet was only 50 mm thick compared to 90 mm on the Sherman. It's not like the 75 mm M3 was the only gun ever mounted on the Sherman and even that was superior to the German 5cm KwK 39 L/60 and 7.5cm KwK 37 L/24 in penetration.  The Panzer IV's production score should've a lot higher, it's 2nd only to the Stug III in production. Compared to its contemporaries, there's nothing really complex/advanced in it's design. It uses clutch and brake steering like the T-34 and one of the oldest forms of suspension known to man, leaf-springs. It's not like Germany has the massive and advanced factories of America, which can produce entire hulls using only a couple castings.  Tommy Cooker is also apparently American Cooker... at least he didn't say Ronson.  German tanks all having two-way radios early on in the war isn't true at all, most could only receive."

Shermans caught fire due to gasoline engines and not because US tankers shoved extra ammo up their asses as well as any other interior space they could find! Never mind that tanks like the Panther were just as prone to fire. Fear factor zero? Tell that to the Germans who were ordered to shoot Fireflys first, because that gun could wreak havoc on their armor.   Merkava: Escape hatches were common even on WWII tanks. Remember that scene from Fury where one of the crew members escapes through a hatch in the bottom of the tank before hiding?  Mahk Foh Pantser: Christ they really went and overhyped this tank. At first, it was more like an assault gun with a turret. The main armament was a 75mm howitzer that fired mostly HE. It was good against infantry and soft targets but woefully poor against armor. Only later when the Germans encountered Russian armor did they decide that the Pz. IV was a better platform to up-gun than the Pz. III. However, the makers of this show decided to focus on the Panzer IV as it was used during the blitz. In fact, they barely talk about the tank, instead choosing to focus on blitz tactics. Why mention the Panzer IV then? Why not the Panzer 3, 2, or Hell, 1?  Tiger: Well, they're sort of right. Allied tank guns had a dog of a time trying to penetrate the Tiger from the front when it first came out.

Down it travels from the hills through the sea of olive groves, headed towards the seaport of Sfax. It's a journey of some 337km (210 miles), lasting four and a half days, which testifies well to the overall march capacity of this steel colossus. The thing weighs about 31 metric tons.  It was loaded onto a ship in the harbour whilst German fighter planes wheeled overhead in the clear sky of Africa and not one enemy bomber dared intrude on this deadly zone. Now, after many intermediate stops, this star of American armament has arrived at its destination, a proving ground near Berlin, in the hands of of German arms experts who are testing its combat efficiency and durability.

The vision cupola is something the M4(75) and T-34-76 got later on. Still even as the original T-34 model 1940 gave the commander a panoramic periscope in its hatch, this feature disappeared in the early stages of Barbarossa to reappear later on while the M4 retained its hatch periscope.  As for gun optics the T-34 always had two sights one periscopic (unmagnified) and one telescopic while the Sherman's original M34 gun mount did not allow for a telescopic sight. This was to be addressed with the M34A1 mount.  The main advantage of the early Shermans compared to the T-34-76's, is that the Shermans have a three man turret crew (dedicated commander). Something that was planned to be addressed by the canceled T-34M. The Sherman was also easier to service especially since the bogies just bolt off while on the T-34-85's the turret gets in the way of servicing one of the units. The Sherman in general requires less maintenance than the T-34. Of coarse this doesn't take into account the shortages and disruptions T-34 production took with some built without turret ventilators and with noisy rubber saving resilient (steel rimmed) road wheels."

If he is the commander of a platoon or a company, it was impossible, we only have one head! The Czech tank was only good for marches. The part ""below the belt"" is good, half-automatic planetary drives, good suspension. Wonderful! But only for driving.  The steel was bad. The gun, 3.7 cm, was too weak against a T-34. If the Russians weren't re-arming and had a T-34 earlier or if they used them correctly, the war would end in 1941, winter at the latest.  You remember your first tank kill though, right?  First tank? Where did this happen...well, first, it was not me, it was my gunner. First tank...I remember, at Ladoga, Sinyavino.  This was already in a Tiger?  Yes, yes.

The issue wasn't that the Tiger wasn't well armed and armored, it was that it was really a symbol of the German inability to think beyond the tactical level. Tactically, the Tiger was a great weapon. But from an operational and strategic standpoint it made little sense."
ShitWehraboosSay,3cc5d0,pronhaul2012,3,Tue Jul 7 04:24:01 2015 UTC,Curiously the KwK42 was much better than the KwK36 on a paper level. I've always found it interesting because the Tiger as a design was overdesigned in all kinds of weird fashions.
ShitWehraboosSay,3cc5d0,buy_a_pork_bun,3,Tue Jul 7 09:01:43 2015 UTC,The KwK 42 was actually the weapon the Tiger(H) was intended to carry in its final form. The MAN Panther's turret is even a modified version of the one for the Tiger H2.  Still the KwK 36 was probably the more appropriate weapon.  HE-frag performance is quite important when in a breakthrough role as the choice of armament for the Jumbo Sherman and later Churchills demonstrated. Plus the difference in penetration between the two weapons tapers off at range and thickness/diameter mechanics come into play.

This served to protect the few possessions which the Soviet regime had left in the hands of private individuals and strengthened the confidence of the people in the fairness and justice of the German forces.   Once a feeling of mutual confidence had developed, the dance- and music-loving inhabitants arranged village festivals at harvest time which were regularly attended by German district officials and members of the security units.   To assure the proper treatment of the Russian population, all German officers and noncommissioned officers appointed to these administrative posts were given a short orientation course by German experts on Russia. The redistribution of collective property was begun with the greatest caution, so as to cause the least possible disturbance to the general structure of the local economy. Collective workshops were abolished and henceforth every craftsman was permitted to practice his trade freely. For the repair and rehabilitation of factories and for their subsequent operation, skilled laborers were placed under the supervision of men with suitable background who were drawn from the German forces or even from the native population. The administration of state farms (Sovkhoz) was decentralized, and they were turned into local agricultural cooperatives.   The local inhabitants were immediately reimbursed for all deliveries by certificates of value received, and the amounts were credited by the Russian local administration against their requirements of every-day commodities.   With the aid of the Russian mayor, who was extremely active and willing to cooperate, a program was initiated for the repair of damaged housing and the construction of new dwellings. Offenses against the occupying forces were handled by German military courts with the cooperation and advice of local experts. In no instance was it necessary to inflict the death penalty or to take hostages.    There can be little doubt that by the winter of 1941-42 the basic pattern of the Soviet partisan organization had been established. To lay the groundwork in German-occupied territory, Russian agents under the guise of helpless civilians took advantage of the kindheartedness of the German soldier by passing through the lines and infiltrating into the army group rear areas. Other agents who had been left behind during the retreat of the Red Army gradually began their work. Many of them were women who felt that they could count on protection by the German soldiers.         this document is basically painting the germans as kindly, peaceful occupiers, and the DASTARDLY RUSSIANS using their insidious propaganda to turn the people against them. this is what, circa 1951, the US Army actually believed. fuck you, franz halder."

You have to be careful with it instead of yelling ""KRUPP STAHL"" and charging ahead. Even lower-tier tanks like the T-34-85 can reliably penetrate Tigers. That's not dev bias, that's how it was in real life.   At tier VII, the Tiger goes against Tiger-killers such as the IS and T29 (fuck the devs for making the odds fair). Thankfully, the fully-upgraded Tiger is based off an experimental model with the 88mm gun from the Tiger II. If anything, the devs made it more powerful than your average Tiger would have been.   The solution? Quit whining because your mythical tank isn't as powerful as you think it was. The Tiger in WoT is a fine sniping tank and can wreck shit if you use it properly."

However, when we come down to the top tier vehicles, the USSR machines simply decimate everything they face (especially the T-54 with full HEAT ammo loadout, any of the tier X medium tanks or the IS-7). In War Thunder Air Part, there is far more hate against bad US teams rather than UP German stuff, but I can still remember the time when the Me262 had to go fight F-86 Sabres and MiG-15s on a daily basis (that did not end well of course)."

So instead the Tiger is balanced against equally nasty tanks. The problem is that you wind up with the Tiger, which was a very early war design, fighting in the same tier as tanks specifically designed to destroy it several years later. It's deficiencies really start to show then, namely it's flat armor. Frankly it's a blessing that they let the Tiger I mount the L71.  And it's just fine in WoT, it's my favorite tank there.

Then, riots in the town itself were followed by attacks on French colons (settlers) in the surrounding countryside resulting in 103 deaths. Subsequent attacks by French authorities and vigilantes are estimated to have caused much greater numbers of deaths amongst the Muslim population of the region: somewhere between 1,020 and 45,000 people (see below).

In turn, Hitler would have no qualms declaring war on the USA after that for interfering.    1942 April 10th - (Late) Operation Barbarossa    The Soviets would have somewhat recovered from the purges and have been busy phasing out obsolete tanks for the T-34 and KV-1. Still, at least the video doesn't have the USSR immediately shrivel up when Moscow falls, though no mention of logistical problems are noted. The Germans were not nearly as motorised as people seem to think.    D-Day   Mentioned then conveniently forgotten about. The Germans would still be totally overextended in the USSR so the Allies would make good progress and spur the Soviets to continue fighting.    Atomic bomb and the Do217   Everybody knows that Deutsch Physik is superior to Jewish Physics! And the Dornier would be 1000kg short of the internal load limit needed for a bomb equivalent to the Fat Man. However, the rather flammable He177 could have done it as one was modified for such a task in real life.    New Europe   Poland was being erased and the region renamed General Government. The Nazis also had no interest in collaborating with Ukraine though I don't know about the Baltic States as there was an Estonian SS division, but the countries didn't have much strategic value or resources to offer, so probably not."

In fact, trying to catch them at their airfields was regarded as one of the best ways to stop the Swallows, though that doesn't count because that's not just 'fighting fair'. A big fuel shortage and engines made from poor quality substitute metals was another factor that often prevented the 262 from flying at all. It was still a fearsome adversary, but not the invincible ubermensch machine that was going to turn the air war around. It would have had to face off against the Meteor and P-80 if the war went on much longer."
ShitWehraboosSay,3bxdbh,Tammo-Korsai,12,Thu Jul 2 23:28:16 2015 UTC,"Hell, even in the air 262 pilots had to be very careful with throttle management to prevent being vulnerable to their piston adversaries.  If they bled off too much energy while the throttles were low, they could be in big trouble because of their inability to just jam the throttle full bore.   Some 262 pilots, and test pilots who flew them after the war such as Eric Brown for the allies have commented that you needed to kind of think ahead with your throttle use.  In a piston fighter, you could expect to get a good jump in power from aggressive throttle application as a reaction to what the aircraft was doing, but with the 262 you had to start slowly applying the throttle earlier.  Obviously part of being a good pilot is anticipating the aircraft's behavior and being ready for it, piston or jet, but the 262 required slightly different thinking."

First, if Hitler had given the Kriegsmarine more resources and more time before starting the war than the U-boats could have conceivably won the battle of the Atlantic... defeating the British and denying the allies a staging area for the invasion of Fortress Europe.   If the Germany was increasing U-boat production pre-war to get ""successful numbers"" the RN and FN would have gotten a consummate funding boost and there would have been even more escorts in the pipeline/commissioned before the war started.  An increased size Kriegsmarine would have sucked up gas supplies like nobody's business.   Second, the Luftwaffe had the RAF on the ropes in late 1940.   The British were producing more aircraft than the Germans were, and unlike the Germans, when they lost a airplane over the UK they could recover the pilot oftentimes.  A Luftwaffe airplane going down over the UK means they've lost an airplane and trained personnel.  Not to mention, the British needed less aircraft to keep aircraft on station(because their airfields were so close, decreasing reaction times) than the Luftwaffe.   Hitler's biggest blunder though was probably hem hawing around when it came to Moscow.   I'd say Hitler's biggest blunder was thinking that he could take on the multiple peer competitors at once.

It's the kind of pseudo-Thermopylae narrative the British just eat up.  You're quite right that the British production and training techniques were simply better than the Luftwaffe's. German casualty rates were so high during the daytime raids on airfields, and as Sealion was postponed indefinitely, the Luftwaffe decided to shift to strategic bombing so that they were doing something (which was completely ineffective as it turns out, effects on production were blips) against the British even if it drained their strength.   The British were in the long run able to dedicate far more resources to the air than the Nazis were as they weren't engaged in a life-or-death continental land war on their Eastern flank, and so the losses endured during the first phase of the Battle of Britain were recovered."

Nope, turns out the famous German tanks were pretty shit. Tanks like the Tiger & Panther were unreliable designs (seriously, the Panther Ausf. D was a mess) and costly to produce. Then you had stuff like the Jagdtiger and the Maus, which were completely unnecessary and wastes of resources.  I also used to believe in clean Wehrmacht. Turns out their tromp through Eastern Europe and the crimes they committed quickly disproves that."
ShitWehraboosSay,3btlq1,uggmun,2,Thu Jul 2 04:11:58 2015 UTC,"I used to believe stuff similar to that only because it was the only information I was getting.  In middle school the only info I was getting was from shitty TV ""documentaries"" read: regular programming about WWII.  A lot of the historians interviewed on the History channel seemed to be raging Nazi apologist ""buffs"" rather then actual historians who perpetuated the clean Wehrmacht myth.  In high school I started expanding into low budget catalog and picture books about the war that always made out the panzers as overpowered machines.  The History channel did the same thing and said the Germans only lost because they were outnumbered.  I was getting a very sanitized version of the war, weapons and battles, that was it.  The only knowledge I had of the Holocaust was of the concentration camps, and later in high school, the Einsatzgruppen, but even them I didn't understand too well.  The brakes came on once I started reaching Nazi apologist bullshit capacity and I realized that the logical conclusions to be made from what I was hearing were that the Germans weren't as bad as I thought, and I didn't accept that.  I started to realize that the German heavy tanks had strongpoints, but overall they were just bloated monsters that helped the Allies by useless weapons that broke down and took excessive resources to build.  The fact that the head of the army was executed was the first clue I had that I was getting Nazi apologist BS."
ShitWehraboosSay,3btlq1,uggmun,6,Thu Jul 2 04:36:46 2015 UTC,"For sure it's the documentaries. Looking back at them, it's laughable how inaccurate they can be.

ShitWehraboosSay,3btlq1,uggmun,2,Thu Jul 2 05:00:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was recently thinking about them, and it's really quite amazing what they passed off.  Two hour specials are usually better since they're not the ""educational"" version of sitcoms, but they're not the one hour daily programs that get crapped out by a narrator and b-roll editor.  I suspect that they suffered from the fact that professional historians would cost to much to have talk on the show, so they settled for having ""buffs"" spew out whatever they remember on the subject.  These WW2 buffs are wehraboo loons who just fetishize the Nazi military.  There was this one guy, Dana something, who was talking on a show from the perspective of the Wehrmacht.  He said that most of the soldiers didn't know about the Holocaust and would have been horrified to know that it was happening."
ShitWehraboosSay,3btlq1,Swardington,5,Thu Jul 2 05:17:02 2015 UTC,"And the Wehrabooism spreads because those documentaries are the most accessible ways to learn about WWII. Let's say you really want to learn about panzers. One Panzer Tracts book runs from $20-$30 and each book is only about a single AFV. You're talking about spending a couple hundred bucks just to learn about the famous German WWII tanks. Your average Joe isn't gonna do this, so flipping on the TV to the military channel or something and watching ""TOP 10 TANKS OF WWII"" for half an hour is way easier."

This would spread misinformation to everyone, but most people would have more of a block against becoming a zealous apologist, I think.  I'm guessing that there has to be something with the personality of the wehraboos who defend the Germans.  Maybe a contrarian complex combined with some sort of inadequacy, plus someone who is too lazy to change themselves?  In that type one could easily adopt the persona of a large militarized nation and think of themselves as part of it, even if they're really just an out of shape nerd."
ShitWehraboosSay,3btlq1,potato_delusions,10,Thu Jul 2 06:12:03 2015 UTC,"I got into WWII from Indiana Jones and Star Wars, so no, they were always the villains. The closest I came was in high school, when I was part of a WWII minded group of friends, and the wehraboos became kind of like bullies, telling us Alliroos that we were just brainwashed jingos believing that our country was the great heros and the rest were just monsters. So after looking up what jingo meant, I also researched the Axis side of WWII and came to a startling and life changing discovery,  Finland was fucking awesome. Not only did they fight back against the Soviet Union not once but twice, they were at war with Britain and Germany at one time or another, there was nominal involvement with the Holocaust, and they were the only Axis countries that weren't occupied by the Allies (not including the parts the Soviet Union absorbed)  But if the wehraboos thought they had made an Axis ally in this new sisuboo, they were mistaken. Because now I just had more counterpoints to their Nazi nonsense, like if Germany was just trying to fight communism, then where were they during the Winter War? Oh right, allying with the Soviet Union. Or if they said that Stalingrad could have been won if blah blah blah, I'd just point out that the Finns were smart enough to not get involved there.  So TL;DR, I've always thought Nazis were dumb, but Finland was the antihero of the war."
ShitWehraboosSay,3btlq1,OldPinkertonGoon,5,Thu Jul 2 04:29:53 2015 UTC,"I had a group of friends I talked about the war with in high school.  There were no wehraboos to be our bullies.  The Nazis were unquestionably the enemy for other reasons.  We had a micronation roleplaying thing going on, and my friend Alex was the head of the Anti Nazi secret police and he had an absolutely brutal zeal for how he planed to go about ridding the world of Nazis.  I'll explain more in a bit because it's interesting.  This was coming at a time when we were being taught to question everything and that people were always good, so it helped to be grounded by belief that the Nazis were absolutely evil and apologia was a grave sin.  I never really started learning counter points to Nazi apologist nonsense until I was in college.  I was around people who had some distorted views that I didn't know were actually false.  Interestingly enough learning German helped me break free of them and come to realize that everything they were saying were horrible myths.  I'd say it's because it gave me understand German history more.  Once I started learning German, I started to swing into hardcore anti wehraboo territory.  I was learning more about the Holocaust, and maybe thinking in German all the time made me more conscious about not tolerating the propagation of Nazi apologia.  Anyway, I realized that the war wasn't actually as close a call as I thought it had been; the Germans really had no chance of winning once they invaded the USSR.  Regarding the wehraboos in college, 100 level German classes were filled with them, and they'd bail after the first year.  One of them was already weird to begin with, but his wehrabooism made it worse.  He'd get absolutely plastered in his suite and follow his friends around to parties like a kite.  When they'd roll in, he'd sit down and space out and refuse to talk to me on the grounds that he was too shit faced.  There were some really fine girls that would be in his room and he was always just sitting on his bed looking like that one background creep.  There was this one really hot girl who started talking to him at a party and he just blew it off.  This was his normal mode at parties.  Sometimes he'd start making Nazi salutes and shouting slogans.  Once I was at a party in an apartment, and he just came it, started goose stepping, faced a wall with posters, did a salute, and started yelling some bullshit in German."

I guess I needed something to justify my beliefs, so I made liberal use of the clean wehrmacht, apolitical Wehrmacht, fighting for their country, K/D ratios, Allied numbers, their generals, and a tech wank. This went on until fairly recently. It's also not like I was careful where I took information from, so my Wehrabooism was also fed from less than reliable sources. Then I discovered the clean Wehrmacht myth on bad history. And from there, I only discovered more and more about the reality of the Wehrmacht.   I vowed to be more careful about what I read online.

His sleep had been lousy, continuously interrupted by two gay guys, one apparently named “Stuart” or maybe “Slade”—it was hard to be sure, what with the slurred speech—and the other named or nicknamed “Thanas,” buggering each other in a nearby tent until all hours of the night and early morning. Then, too, it was possible there were three or four rather than two. The only line he could be sure of was, “Oh, my, that’s a big one.”   He's also apparently working on a book involving his version of Sea Lion (as I recall, FJ in Kent while the most of the British Army is at Dunkirk), which will be to blame and yell at pacifists for the British defeat. So looks like he's apparently still butthurt about that tussle."

When it was pointed out that Germany didn't have the air lift for it, he said they would only need one to hold 26 miles worth of front for the landing forces to get there.  He also claimed that only 60 tons of supplies per day would be required ignoring the fact that the Ju-52 force couldn't even deliver that. However, his piece de resistance was to claim that even if the invasion barges were sunk in mid-channel, the German troops would just swim ashore and proceed to establish their beachhead anyway.

And sure, just swim the what, twenty plus miles to shore after having your barge shot out from underneath you?

Sigh Sabaton's lyrics are relevant once again:   Were they the victims of the time  Or young men who lost their way?  What about the men executing orders?   Wehraboo philosophy summed up in three sentence fragments.   Edit:  Dear god he's digging himself deeper   Executions of men and their families for refusing to commit war crimes such as executing people in camps were actually quite rare and there has been a paper on this.   A single paper does not refute this fact. Many Germans were terrified of stepping out of line because it was established early that those who did disappeared.    Like how about the multitude of books that have shown that refusal to participate in atroticites (or indeed committing them) was pretty much never punished with anything more than a slap on the wrist?   As for your Gusto and indifference comment, I think you need to re-examine that statement because it is completely one sided. In fact the whole reason the gas chambers were engineered and built was because the SS men in the early parts of the war, the men who were the meanest of the mean, had issues with assassinating as many people as Himler wanted them too. Actually Himler himself couldn't even handle it... he witnessed one execution, became nauseous, saw what it did to the men, and ordered a more efficient way of enacting the final solution.   ""Hey guys, Germans couldn't handle executing large amounts of people by gun, so rather than stopping the executions, they decided to come up with a more efficient form of doing it; so in a way the Germans were really the good guys""   I am NOT condoning anything the Nazis did, but I am speaking up for the HUMAN BEINGS who had no choice and stating that they are as much victims as the Jews.

Social pressures, nothing. One had to a) volunteer to become an NSdAP member1, and b) volunteer for the SS.  Can't stress this enough: The camp guards were volunteers almost exclusively (reconvalescent Waffen SS was on guard duty, too).  1: party membership was de facto required for anyone in the government above county level equivalent, everybody else was seen ""favorably"" by the powers-that-were, gaining easier promotions.

Of course they were not nearly as victimized as the populations of Europe they butchered and terrorized, but that doesn't mean there isn't nuance to be seen here.

ShitWehraboosSay,3bkvq1,jdmgto,4,Tue Jun 30 17:39:42 2015 UTC,"Very very good ships. Going from the NC's to the SoDaks to the Iowas to the Montanas was less starting from scratch each time and more an evolution of some very good ideas. The NC's were quicker than the US had made it's BB's before and they might have gotten carried away with it but it doesn't stop them from being very good. That's the thing about those three classes, they're just solid designs that don't have any glaring weaknesses. Fantastic guns firing a great AP shell. Fire control that was second to none. A good armor profile that was effective against both low angle shells and high angle shells and bombs. Decent torpedo protection (which the NC's lacked a bit of), middle of the road speed until the Iowa's went off to the races, a great secondary battery, and amazing AAA firepower. Probably sound a bit like a US BB fanboy but, they were damned amazing ships."
ShitWehraboosSay,3bkvq1,Rittermeister,3,Tue Jun 30 17:57:07 2015 UTC,"Despite the speed advantage of the Bismarck, do you think a c. 1941 USS North Carolina would have been more than a match for her?"
ShitWehraboosSay,3bkvq1,jdmgto,5,Tue Jun 30 20:00:50 2015 UTC,"Easily. The problem with the speed advantage is that the Bismarck had no other advantages over the NC's. The NC's had comparable armor in a far better layout. The AP shells of the NC's put the Bismarck's to shame (then again they put everyone's to shame). Fire control was probably a wash.  Then again given German naval doctrine and just common sense it's unlikely a Bismarck would try and slug it out with a NC. They'd have used that couple knot advantage to withdraw.  You have to understand, the Bismarck's were less battleships and more overgrown heavy cruisers. I've gotten into this discussion a lot, especially in /r/warshipporn . The problem is that the Germans had a huge gap in their large warship design growth. While other powers grew and evolved after WWI the Germans had to twiddle their thumbs for more than a decade and it was a pretty damn important decade in terms of warship design. That's why the Bismarck had such an awful armor layout, it was essentially a WWI style armoring scheme designed to protect the ship from short range (<10km) fire. They didn't really understand what happened at Jutland and what it meant for armoring a ship, after all their cruisers weren't the ones popping like fireworks. And really, it wasn't that great of an armoring scheme even then, Jutland just demonstrated it's failings painfully to the British.  Don't get me wrong, I love the Bismarck, he was a handsome ship and class, but it was a badly outdated ship from the moment it's keel was laid."
ShitWehraboosSay,3bkvq1,nickik,3,Wed Jul 1 12:11:04 2015 UTC,I have talked to another Ship expert on Reddit (/r/AskHistorians). He clamed that the British Ships at Jutland did fail because of Armour but rather bad safety standards on the ships.  (He also saw some errors with armour but not at Jutland)
ShitWehraboosSay,3bkvq1,jdmgto,7,Wed Jul 1 15:34:54 2015 UTC,"The Brits did have issues with their ammo handling. Namely in an effort to speed up loading they disengaged safety mechanisms so when you took damage up top it could flash down the powder hoists and into the magazines. He's absolutely right, what ""popped them like firecrackers"" was absolutely the magazine detonations which were largely due to lax safety procedures. That said, why they were taking the damage that led to those detonations was that they were armored in the style of the time. They were set up for low angle fire. This is because of many factors but essentially the armor schemes were lagging behind gun design and fire control. They were armored for the old style of slugging matches at significantly less than 10km. At Jutland ships were engaging each other at 15km or more especially in the battlecruiser action. The end result is the heavy belt armor did little to impede plunging long range fire.  If ammo handling procedures had been followed it's likely that the British wouldn't have suffered those losses, but the weak deck armor wouldn't have saved the turrets and the like and the ships would have been badly damaged."
ShitWehraboosSay,3bkvq1,Rittermeister,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:04:38 2015 UTC,Were there any BBs afloat in 1941 that could have given the North Carolina fits? I assume it could deal rather easily with a KGV or Reichelui.
ShitWehraboosSay,3bkvq1,jdmgto,4,Wed Jul 1 13:50:44 2015 UTC,"Fits? None, a fair fight? Depends. The KGVs were very well protected. They were some of the most well protected BB's ever built and were not just protected against their guns but even larger ones. The heavy AP shells of the NC might have been able to do a number on the KGV's deck armor at range but... it's questionable. That said, the 14"" guns on them would have had trouble with the NC's armor at longer ranges. So you've got a case where the KGV could have likely weathered the NC's fire but it's questionable if they could have done anything in return. If anything the lighter armor on the KGV's turrets might have been the deciding factor that would let the NC render the KGV combat ineffective.  The Richelieu, I honestly don't know. I'm much more comfortable with US, British, German, and Japanese designs and haven't done a ton of research on French ships."

The Americans switched over starting around the beginning of WWI (for new construction, first ship Nevada commissioned 1916), and the British (Nelson '27), Japanese (Nagato '20), and French (Dunkerque '37) all switched to AoN for all battleships laid down after Jutland. Germany ship design under the Nazis (and, to be fair, Weimar) was a mess and they never made the switch."

It was the most produced AFV for the Germans; a cheap stop-gap that  rapidly transformed from a true assault gun to a general purpose tank-killer and support weapon.  StuG Brigades were formed late war in an attempt to up German formations hitting power and ability to support their increasingly undertrained infantry.   It fared about as well as it should have, and had robust combat records, but it was far easier to knock out then say, a Panther. Its main tactical advantages was a rather thick gunplate, a low profile and a relatively hard to spot muzzle-report. Allowed for it to get the ever-important first shot off in many an engagement. The lack of a turret and the way its crew compartment was arranged made it a death trap should it get taken in the flank, however."
ShitWehraboosSay,3bl6mk,BritainOpPlsNerf,3,Tue Jun 30 03:38:21 2015 UTC,Well it's ease of knocking out was probably due to it's rather poor visibility being a casemate tank. :D

It used the much more reliable and simple Panzer III chassis that allowed it to become the most numerous piece of German armour as the lack of turret meant less complex assemblies and less metal plating was needed.  The 7.5cm L/48 gun was good against pretty much every Allied tank bar the frontal armour of the IS series, Sherman Jumbo and the up-armoured Churchills. Though these were not too common so the StuG gave a good account of itself overall, especially from ambush positions where it could get the first shot off."
ShitWehraboosSay,3bl6mk,Tammo-Korsai,2,Tue Jun 30 11:02:55 2015 UTC,"The L/48 is that same gun mounted on the Panzer IV, IIRC."

It became outdated by 1943 and by 1944 they had to take out the electrical turret traverse mechanism and replace it with fuel tanks and a hand crank.
ShitWehraboosSay,3bl6mk,buy_a_pork_bun,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:30:18 2015 UTC,"You sure about the L/23 being used extensively throughout the war? The short barreled Panzer IVs production was pretty much halted by the end of 1942 and most the Panzer IVs produced were F2 and above. And that doesn't account for casualties. According to one source (I have no idea how reliable it is), there were short barreled Panzer IVs surviving into 1944.   I'm also sure that the Ausf. J was the only Panzer IV model with the removed turret drive, and it was only produced from mid 1944 to the end."
ShitWehraboosSay,3bl6mk,potato_delusions,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:43:24 2015 UTC,Well I mean used extensively in the context that there was a lot left over.

ShitWehraboosSay,3bl6mk,buy_a_pork_bun,5,Tue Jun 30 20:51:31 2015 UTC,"You have to remember it was based on the pre-war Panzer III chasis.  This was a really good tank (you need to see and hear one running to aporeciate its quality), well engineered and reliable. The Pz III was a really smooth vehicle so using its chasis for the Stug meant none of the problems associated with rushed designs pushed well beyond the base specification.  Apart from its inherent reliability, it's design and production overheads were lower. Minimum re-tooling was needed and the fact that no turret was required greatly simplifies production.  It was a very successful design and its combat record stands as the ultimate mute critic to ludicrous shit like the Ferdinand and Jagdtiger."
ShitWehraboosSay,3bl6mk,jonewer,2,Tue Jun 30 11:05:16 2015 UTC,"Well the Panzer III was horribly overburdened and rather incapable of carrying better guns over the 50mm that it had in it's later iterations.  The STuG was a fantastic way to use the cheap chassis while putting an improved gun on it without needing a larger redesigned chassis to fit a larger turret that would weigh too much because of the relatively small engine.  in other words, it was a great idea. :D"

Did it fare well against (presumably, mostly) Soviet tanks?   No, and yes. The StuG III was built off the Panzer 3 chassis which was well established as a platform at that point, and only simplified it from there. Replacing a rotating turret with a rigid case was far less expensive in terms of manufacturing.   Really the only consistent issue with the Stug was that when flanked- and this was easy- they were excessively vulnerable. It is, however, important to remember that it was initially intended as an assault gun- tank engagements were not something it was entirely equipped to deal with, especially when T-34's or KV-1's showed up."

The idea of the morally superior German Resistance is a wehraboo load of BS designed to make the Germans look better.  Most of the Germans who wanted to kill Hitler only did so because they were huge Nazis or closet Nazis.  Stauffenberg for example just wanted to end the war faster so fewer Germans would be killed; he didn't actually give a fuck about the Holocaust because if he did, he wouldn't have been fighting for the Nazis and he would have tried to end the war earlier.  Wehraboos just love putting up any German who said anything at all against the Nazis as some sort of hero so they can say ""not all Germans"" and then follow that up with ""guys, most of the Germans weren't Nazis, were against the Holocaust while also not knowing it happened, and really wanted to kill Hitler to end the war."""

Not only were some clear war criminals, but many (like Gersdorff and Tresckow) were complicit in truly terrible actions even if they privately disapproved of certain crimes. The latter 2 officers, for example, regularly signed off on criminal orders (e.g. the seizure of Soviet children for forced labour, the execution of inhabitants who were caught in ""forbidden"" areas, vicious anti-partisan reprisals. use of infamous SS cavalry units in 'rear security operations'), sometimes with stated approval!

Elser, in fact, can hardly be described in any grand terms. He was not a dedicated communist nor a huge political activist. he basically was just a guy who wanted Hitler dead because he disagreed with his politics and thought of him as a dangerous dictator.

Then, apparently Germany ""endured a solid 5 months of bombing of its cities and civilians before responding in kind"", and the attack on Coventry was fine because only 380 people died, compared to massive German casualties. Except of course the massive German casualties only came much later in the war, and those five months of ""solid"" bombing were incredibly sporadic, by a barely effective force, aimed at military and industrial targets (though granted Bomber Command had about sod all chance of landing bombs within a mile at the time) and resulted in minimal casualties (e.g. 19 dead from 38 raids on Hamburg between June and October 1940). So retaliation is completely justified, as long as you have the foresight to retaliate for things that will happen in four years time.

Also NATO had another wonderful plan where they would essentially sacrifice central Germany to create a ""chemical corridor"", although the efficacy of that given that Pact vehicles tended to be NBC sealed, is questionable.   This all played into Soviet hands anyway. Most of their plans seem to be defensive in nature, they were assuming NATO would start the fight, and then they could point out to the lesser NATO members that it was America nuking their countries, not them, and all they wanted was America out of Europe.  There are quite a few in intelligence circles (Ralph Peters being a prominent example) who think our almost willful ignorance of what the Soviet plan actually was would have bit us in the ass hard."

Interestingly,  the Soviet rapists appeared to suffer from cognitive dissonance with regards to the rapes they committed. There are accounts of them refusing to shoot rape victims because they were ""better than the Germans"".  I also hold to a theory that its a result of Soviet policy towards sexuality and feminism (I.E sex doesn't exist, or at least is not discussed, as it does not fit within the socialist dialectic) leading to a general sexual nativity and repression amongst soviet troops which created the mindset which allowed mass rape.

Owing to an encroachment in the army rear zone, already reported thither, the preparations made by us for liquidation of the Jews in the area Glebokie, have been disturbed. The army rear zone, without contacting me, has liquidated 10,000 Jews, whose systematical elimination had been provided for by us in any event.    Operational Situation Report USSR No. 24, (July 16, 1941)   On July 2 the corpses of 10 German Wehrmacht soldiers were found. In retaliation, 1160 Jews were shot by the Ukrainians with the help of one platoon of the police and one platoon of the infantry.   Operational Situation Report USSR No. 126, October 27, 1941   This concerns the relation of the Einsatzgruppe and its Kommandos with other offices and authorities. Its relation to the Army is especially noteworthy. From the outset, the Einsatzgruppe succeeded in establishing excellent terms with all Army headquarters. This made it possible for the Einsatzgruppe never to operate in the rear of the military zone. On the contrary, the request was frequently made by the Army to operate as far on the front as possible.  In a great number of cases, it happened that the support of the Einsatzkommandos was requested by the fighting troops. Advance detachments of the Einsatzgruppe also participated in every large military action. They entered newly captured localities side by side with the fighting troops. Thus, in all cases, the utmost support was given. For example, in this connection, it is worth mentioning the participation in the capture of Zhitomir, where the first tanks entering the city were immediately followed by three cars of Einsatzkommando 4a.  As a result of the successful work of the Einsatzgruppe, the Security Police is also held in high regard, in particular by the HQ of the German Army. The liaison officers stationed in Army HQ are loyally briefed of all military operations, and, besides, they receive the utmost cooperation. The Commander of the 6th Army, Generalfeldmarschall von Richenau, has repeatedly praised the work of the Einsatzkommandos and, accordingly, supported the interests of the SD with his staff.   Code of Ethics for the Conduct of the Troop in the Soviet Union, May 19, 1941   This fight demands ruthless and forceful measures against Bolshevistic heretics, guerilla fighters, saboteurs, Jews and the complete elimination of any active or passive resistance   Reichenau Order, 10 October 1941   Therefore the soldier must have full understanding for the necessity of a severe but just revenge on subhuman Jewry.

Briefing:    As Many As 150,000 Jews Served In Hitler's Military 10-31-3  (Reuters) -- As many as 150,000 men of Jewish descent served in the German military under Adolf Hitler, some with the Nazi leader's explicit consent, according to a U.S. historian who has interviewed hundreds of former soldiers.  Bryan Mark Rigg, history professor at the American Military University in Virginia, told Reuters on Thursday that the issue of soldiers of partial Jewish descent was long a somewhat taboo subject, overlooked by most academics as it threw up thorny questions.  ""Not everybody who wore a uniform was a Nazi and not every person of Jewish descent was persecuted,"" he said. ""Where do they belong? They served in the military but lost mum at Auschwitz.""  According to the Nuremberg Laws of 1935, Jews or those of partial Jewish descent were unfit for military service, but Rigg tracked down and interviewed more than 400 former soldiers of partial Jewish descent -- labelled ""Mischlinge"" (""half-caste"") by the Nazis.  He estimates there were about 60,000 soldiers with one Jewish parent and 90,000 with a Jewish grandparent in the Wehrmacht, the regular army as distinct from the Nazi SS.  ""They thought 'if I serve well they're not going to hurt me and not going to hurt my family',"" he said.  However, on returning home from the campaign in Poland at the start of the war to find persecution of their families worsening, many soldiers classified as half-Jewish started to complain, prompting Hitler to order their dismissal in 1940.  But many of these so-called half-Jewish soldiers continued to serve, sometimes due to delays in the discharge order reaching the front, because they concealed their background or because they applied and won clemency for good service.  Many senior officers with Jewish ancestry won special permission to serve from Hitler himself.  ""History is not so black and white. History about Mischlinge shows how bankrupt the Nazi racial laws were,"" said Rigg.  SENSITIVE SUBJECT  While Germany has long been aware of men serving as soldiers who Nazi race laws should have classified as Jewish, most notably former Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and Luftwaffe Field Marshal Erhard Milch, Rigg's large estimate has surprised many.  Die Welt daily called Rigg's book ""Hitler's Jewish Soldiers"" ""one of the most important Holocaust studies of recent years"". The author was in Berlin to launch the German language version.  ""The Mischlinge suffered the same fate in academic life as they did in real life. There was nobody to speak for them,"" Rigg said. ""People thought it could be misinterpreted, it would be like saying: 'look they did it to themselves'.""  Rigg, who has served in the U.S. Marines and as a volunteer in the Israeli army, was moved to research the subject after he discovered his own Jewish ancestry while probing his family tree and after a chance meeting with a Jewish Wehrmacht veteran.  Many of his subjects were telling their story for the first time and in some cases their families knew nothing of their Jewish heritage. ""They would talk their hearts out, telling me all about this schizophrenic story they went through,"" he said.  He is convinced that most of the soldiers of Jewish decent were not aware of the Nazis' systematic murder of Jews, noting that most half-Jews reported to deportation stations in 1944.  ""Most say they do not feel guilty about serving in the military, they feel guilty about what they didn't do to save their relatives,"" he said."

Not even a small interviewing sample size if you ask me, considering this type of research and thinking about gathering that many people after all these years. Interviewing itself is not a perfect method (certainly some people will lie, have selective memory, just forget all of it... for whatever reason), however when a historian tries to deal with questions like ""How many knew and how many didn't?"", there will never be perfect methods in the first place."

Also, I've actually read the book (thank you very much). And as I'm sure you know from reading said book. Calling the soldiers ""Jews"" is a little incomplete. Many, if not most of the ""Jewish"" soldiers were self hating Jews who saw their Jewish ancestry as a burden not something to be proud of/acknowledge. Furthermore most Jewish soldiers were expelled via Hitler's order of April 8th, 1940 before the real extermination of Eastern Jews had begun, and generally before the complete transformation of the Wehrmacht into ""Hitler's Army"" (to borrow from Omer Bartov's book of the same name). Before later becoming victims of the system they had fought to protect. Yes, some Jews and others who should have been persecuted under Nazi racial laws fell through the cracks or otherwise got protected; but that was not a norm, rather an exception.   As to the book itself. Its an interesting study, but in no way is it authoritative, nor is it heavy on actual analysis.   For example Rigg makes statements like:   None the less the majority were unaware of what lay beyond the OT camps  Many did not see the OT camps as being the first step on the path to systemic murder   Both of these statements are uncited, Riggs then proceeds to cite a single German/Jewish soldier's testimony that ""he didn't know about his father getting sent to a camp."" That's not good enough to make such a broad sweeping claim. Reviews have pointed out this issue with Rigg before. For example a review by David Yelton of Rigg's follow up book. But more importantly the reviews of Amy R. Sims and Patricia Von Papen-Bodek which can be found on JSTOR.   Edit:  Just to add one more note to clear things up further. Rigg's work is a very useful look at an understudied subject. None the less it has flaws enough that just throwing out there as some sort of ""gotcha"" moment is a waste of time. Of course this is ignoring that its hardly relevant in any way to the discussion of the Wehrmacht's crimes (the purpose of the thread as a whole) or my own comment dealing with the attempts by post war German writers to distance themselves from the Nazis/SS and to white wash the crimes of the Wehrmacht."

The OP explained that he thought the average Wehrmacht soldier probably had no knowledge of the systematic Jewish genocide. You then said that the history was and still is written by the Germans (many naturally claimed that they didn't know and they only fought for their country), so I pointed out to one group that belonged to the Wehrmacht who at least had a motivation to act otherwise had they known about the genocide.   As far as I see, the strongest evidence that makes Rigg believe that they didn't know is that most half-Jews reported to their OT deportations when ordered. They were even given several days or weeks to report. He states that ""If everyone knew about the Holocaust, one might assume that they would have tried to hide, escape or possibly commit suicide rather than report at the OT gathering point."" I think this is a reasonable point regardless of whether they were self-hating Jews or not.  I agree that his work has flaws but saying that he bases his conclusion on a single example (you mean Gerhard Guttstadt and his father?) is not right.  Regrettably I can't read things on JSTOR."

I never said it still was.    so I pointed out to one group who at least had a motivation to act otherwise had they known about the genocide.    It was a group largely kicked out of the Wehrmacht before the actual complete extermination began. Not really a good argument for your average German soldier knowing nothing of Jewish persecution/violence.    As far as I see, the strongest evidence that makes Rigg believe that they didn't know is that most half-Jews reported to their OT deportations when ordered. They were even given several days or weeks to report. He states that ""If everyone knew about the Holocaust, one might assume that they would have tried to hide, escape or possibly commit suicide rather than report at the OT gathering point."" I think this is a reasonable point.   Except ascribing all their motivations to ""they must not have known"" is a sweeping generalization. There are plenty of reasons said people might not have resisted going to camps. Many were half Jews or quarter Jews and thus assumed they might get better treatment along with their service to the Reich. Many may have feared reprisals if they did not comply. It's a sweeping generalization to assume all ""didn't know.""   Also, I just want to emphasize again. Many of these soldiers would have been expelled in April of 1940, about a year before the ramping up of anti Jewish violence in the Soviet Union in 1941. Many of these Jews weren't ""frontline"" soldiers when the major bouts of violence occurred, so it's rather a moot point in that regard.    but saying that he bases his conclusion on a single example (you mean Gerhard Guttstadt and his father) is not right.   I said no such thing. I said he makes broad sweeping generalizations (like the ones I quoted) and doesn't back them up with proper citation, preferring to rely on a few anecdotal stories to back up his point. In the part I quoted, he literally did just cite one soldier's personal recollections. So yes, it's a more than valid criticism."

Not really a good argument for your average German soldier knowing nothing of Jewish persecution/violence.     I can't find/remember where I can find the number in Rigg's book, however here it is estimated that 65,000 Mischlinge (of the 150,000 in 1939) still served in the Wehrmacht by 1945.  Rigg does state that by Spring 1941, 50% of the 150,000 above still served in the Wehrmacht though. And both sources state that Hitler changed his mind frequently, so many were discharged and redrafted and discharged.  Also I must say that by mentioning this book, I just wanted to point out to some complications regarding the ""whether they knew or didn't know"" matter. I think that the majority of the soldiers began realizing the truth at some point. However for various reasons it does matter (to me, at least) whether these people came to that knowledge in 1944 or in 1940 or after the war had ended.    Except ascribing all their motivations to ""they must not have known"" is a sweeping generalization. There are plenty of reasons said people might not have resisted going to camps.

I agree that it would be a sweeping generalization to assume ""all"" didn't know, however Rigg only thinks that ""most"" didn't know. And with a good reason, imho. If they had in fact known about the true nature of the camps, would it have been more reasonable of them to investigate further before concluding that their service might lead to better treatment?  And what reprisals would be worse than what was awaiting them in the concentration camps?  Because for sure if I were a half Jew and the government of this country I'm staying in suddenly started to kill full Jews including my relatives (Considering the group Rigg documented alone , 1,000 soldiers had 2,300 relatives who became Holocaust victims) I wouldn't allow myself to be deported to the concentration camps thinking that optimistically. Except if you would argue that the repressive nature of the dictatorship/their ideology made their mind so mentally weak and they hated their (half) Jewish selves so much that all normal instincts were broken and they could not even think about protecting themselves anymore, even though they knew everything about the camps.  ""Hitler's Jewish Soldiers"" got him the Colby Award, but the matter isn't even whether the book is authoritative enough or not, or whether the author is famous enough or not. It is whether his reasoning above, concerning a very specific matter, makes sense or not. It's that simple."

Let's look at what Hitler said:    majority of Americans as ""Aryans"" ruled by Jewish plutocracy; he saw UK as potential ally, Russians ""incapable of intelligent thought"" and France rapidly ""Negroizing"" itself    1) Completely ignores the massive diversity of Jewish political thought in America. Put Noam Chomsky, Daniel Pipes, and Russ Feingold in a room and see if they agree on much. Hint: they won't.   2) Yes he wanted the UK as an ally, but this was a delusional belief and one he clung to for way too long. Hitler was so wrong here   3) Just plain racism. The Eastern Front proved Hitler was terribly wrong haha.   4) And racism again. It's also incorrect. Since the 1920s the black population of France has reached a mighty..... 4%,  probably less"

ShitWehraboosSay,3b6cie,jonewer,3,Fri Jun 26 16:46:38 2015 UTC,"Section 2. Capture of article  Tiger 131:       Knowing that the Allies were preparing a major push towards Tunis, the Germans launched a spoiling attack on the night of 20/21 April 1943.  Four points were attacked simultaneously, including a pass on the north side of a hill called Djebel Djaffa.  Two Tigers and several other Panzers advanced through this pass before dawn, and were gradually driven back during the day. Tiger 131 was hit by three shots from 6-pounders from British Churchill tanks of A Squadron, 4 Troop of the 48th Royal Tank Regiment. A solid shot hit the Tiger's gun barrel and ricocheted into its turret ring, jamming its traverse, wounding the driver and front gunner and destroying the radio. A second shot hit the turret lifting lug, disabling the gun's elevation device. A third shot hit the loader's hatch, deflecting fragments into the turret. The German crew bailed out, taking their wounded with them and leaving the knocked-out but still driveable and largely intact tank behind.  Their identity and fate are unknown. The tank was secured by the British as they captured Djebel Djaffa hill.  Tiger 131 was the first intact Tiger tank captured by British forces.

Burning Atlanta was a no-brainer. Any commander would have done the same, but very few would have dared undertake the march from Atlanta to the Sea at all. It was so radical a plan that British military historian B. H. Liddell Hart claimed it marked Sherman as “the first modern general” and placed him alongside Napoleon and Belisarius as one of the greatest commanders of all time.  Because every column of smoke rising from a burning mansion, barn, or granary was intended by Sherman as a signal to a psychotically stubborn, deluded Confederate (white, landowning) population that they had lost, and that every additional life lost was, as he kept trying to tell them, an atrocity, a crime far greater than property destruction."

Hitler’s eye for quality was just extraordinary.” He swept his arm across the army of motionless Nazis surrounding us, taking in the uniforms and the bayonets, the dimly glimmering guns and medals. “More than that, though,” he continued, “I want to preserve things. I want to show the next generation how it actually was. And this collection is a memento for those who didn’t come back.

However, all this got really to his head and gave him a false sense of superiority, so that he was very hard to dissuade from obviously bad decisions (like using the Me-262 as a fighter-bomber), because in his mind he, and his ideal party soldiers, were superior to the old prussian officer caste, whose own sense of superiority he resented (the 'bohemian private' complex). He also often spent a more time with the tactical disposition of divisions, regiments and sometimes even bataillons and companies than with the big strategic picture.   Hitler was essentially trying to coordinate everything himself - and it was very hard to make him listen to critique so there was no corrective to his impulsive and increasingly fatalistic disposition. If you combine all that, you get the mess that Hitler was as the final arbiter of war strategy. It's really interesting to read the surviving protocols of the big briefings in the Führer-HQ."

Many people always bring up this strange this argument, or the argument that he tried to bring Holocaust to North Africa, deported 2,500 Jews.. etc (which is more understandable btw, because it comes from the respectable Spiegel which claims that it comes from historians Mallmann, Cüppers, Caron and Mullner.  Turns out Mallmann and Cuppers claim that Rommel didn't even meet the guy who was sent to do the dirty job and never claim any of the above. Jean-Christoph Caron, one of the two authors of the TV doc they mentioned, also wrote an article about Rommel in that same year for Spiegel. Again, no such accusing tone: article  Finally, just 5 years after that, even the author of the Spiegel article later toned it down completely already when writing another article about Rommel  But don't expect the positive articles to be translated into English.   \\  Also regarding slave labour, it was the Todt Organization, Speer and Sauckel who were responsible for the it and the actual construction. Rommel as a military had no responsibility there but he did give a damn about it:    Rommel's protestation that the policy towards France needed major revision, especially the role of the secret police of the SS, was given short shrift, as was his denunciation of the Sauckel program, a slave labor draft operation requiring  the administrations of the occupied countries to send to Germany a periodic quota of people for incorporation into the German labor force. In France opposition to this measure took the form of many young men disappearing into the ranks of the Maquis, the underground French resistance forces.    Marshall  Rommel on the other hand had faith in paid labor using French farmers much more   Fortunately for the Allies, German production could no longer fill the marshal's requirements. The Todt organization, the immense German engineering arm, which would normally have been involved in defense construction, was so busy at home repairing Allied bomb damage that it could be of little help. A stickler for obeying international conventions to the letter, Rommel issued orders that no French citizen could be forced to work on defense construction but that volunteers would be well paid. Commanders were instructed to inform the villagers that the areas least likely to be invaded were those with the most formidable defenses. The local populace in self-interest joined in the labor by the thousands. ""Let the invasion come,"" was the Frenchman's attitude, ""but not in my backyard.   Marshall    “Pay them well and promptly for it. Point out that the enemy is least likely to invade where the most obstacles have been erected! The French farmers will be only too glad to line their purses.”    Ambrose  Certainly the Vichy government ""volunteered"" men for this in least idealistic ways then Rommel had imagined but at least his interference did help:    Rene-Georges Lubat, 91, is one of the few Frenchmen who worked on the Wall who is still alive. In 1942 he was ""volunteered"" by his village mayor and sent to work on defences in the Arcachon sector.  ""There was no choice about it. We had to go,"" he said. ""Naturally we weren't enthusiastic, but it is not as if we had any choice.  ""The conditions were not terrible. We weren't beaten or anything and we got a basic wage. At the start we could go home on Sundays, but after Stalingrad they put up barbed wire and we were stuck inside the work camp.    BBC"

ShitWehraboosSay,3ayhco,TheD3rp,5,Thu Jun 25 23:16:35 2015 UTC,"I know this is a circlejerk but do you guys have to take it to that level?  If you criticize him, at least do it over something that actually existed like his expansionist militarism (yes, chivalrous expansionist militarism. In his eyes war was about fighting forces defeating each other trying their best to preserve the enemy's defeated/captured personnel, while not harming the population and the winner had the responsibility to treat the defeated countries with chivalry like he fully expected from the Allied leaders later), even if this was not against Western imperialist countries's standards at that time (I've never heard of French soldiers protesting their government for invading my country and other countries in Asia/Africa. Apparently invading ('civilizing') other people's lands only became unlawful when they decided that Nazi Germany should be punished after the war). These imaginary war crimes or anti-Semitic activities just don't worth it.  Holderfield and Varhola state the same thing as Ambrose    Get the French country folk to help erect the obstacles,"" Rommel reportedly ordered one division. ""Pay them well and promptly for it    And also by these two authors    Rommel had no control over the Todt Organization, so he could not order work done, nor did he have the final say on what defenses Todt constructed     Also, from Desmond Young    His eyes were opened during the months he was in Germany before he took over command of Army Group B. He had long disapproved of the Nazi ""scum"". For the first time he now learned at first hand from German officers what the Gestapo and the SS had done in Poland and Russia, what they were still doing there and in the occupied countries of Western Europe. For the first time he learned of slave labr, of the mass extermination of Jews, of the battle of the Warsaw ghetto, of gas chambers and the rest of it. In North Africa it had been assumed that Germany was fighting a ""gentleman's war"". It was characteristic of Rommel that he went straight to Hitler himself with these discoveries. ""If such things are allowed to go on,"" he said, ""we shall lose the war."" Strangely enough, the Führer condescended to argue with Rommel at some length. But he left no doubt in the latter's mind that he had not the slightest intention of changing his methods.    From the recent book of Ian Beckett    On his inspection tours in spring 1944 Rommel insisted again and again that the local population should be recruited as labour to help build the Atlantic Wall. The civilians should be informed that the stronger the defence fortifications  were, the less likely it was that the Allies would invade there and hence the horrors of war would not happen in their area. At the same time, Rommel felt pity for the French when he saw their pain and suffering after the Allied aerial bombings Beckett    (Beckett's book, btw, takes on the ""hesitating"" stance but also not condemns Rommel as a criminal. On the other hand, several things including the way they list Maurice Remy together with Ralph George Reuth as being critical towards Rommel makes me wonder whether they are overly impressed with Remy's documentary or something (the Remy book, curiously, doesn't get translated into English).   Where are your sources that state that Rommel showed indifference towards slave labour anyway? At least Ambrose had the surviving French workers backing him up saying that they received basic wage and weren't beaten, as reported by BBC.  Btw I repeated that Rommel had no authority/responsibility over the Todt Organization or Speer. He wasn't even the senior commander in Normandy. There was a German commander who had authority there and was later punished for it and that was Erhard Milch - no other German commander was trialed at Nuremberg for the slave labour program."
ShitWehraboosSay,3ayhco,treebeard87,-1,Fri Jun 26 00:15:23 2015 UTC,"Whatever you say, it still doesn't change the fact he didn't object to the creation of Einsatzgruppe Egypt, refused to participate in the plot to assassinate Hitler, was a terrible strategist, and fought for a genocidal maniac. Also, where did I mention that he used slave labor to build the Atlantic Wall?"
ShitWehraboosSay,3ayhco,TheD3rp,2,Fri Jun 26 00:55:58 2015 UTC,"Read my first post about the Einsatzgruppen Egypt. It is from an article, of which the author doesn't even hold the same opinion anymore. Not to mention the historians that article listed clearly don't share the opinion.  Sorry about the slave labor thing. Actually I tried to reply to the person who posted below you but somehow I put it in the same post I wrote to reply you regarding the Einsatzgruppen Egypt. But then you also commented on the matter protesting the use of Ambrose as a source so I just continued to reply.   Recently declassified tapes show that General Eberbach was overheard by British spies saying (before the  assassination happened.) that Rommel wanted to have Hitler assassinated  ; full doc with multiple historians' opinions. One of the plotters, Gisevius, who apparently didn't like Rommel at all (he didn't sound like he wanted to join the pro Rommel campaign admittedly was widespread at the time, when Germany sorely needed a Hero, a Father Figure), confirmed that he knew about the assassination plan and ""proposed to us to have Hitler assassinated, and then, if possible, Goering and Himmler as well""Nuremberg Trial Proceedings Vol. 12.   As for supporting a genocidal maniac, I discussed it here  As for being a terrible strategist, what does that have to do with being a terrible person?  Also I know I myself am in no position or have no real expertise to judge Rommel as a military commander. But I know that his style has always been controversial and that the careful strategists/theorists often dislike it. I also agree with them that he often displayed a bit too much of an adventurous attitude. But the fact remains that the ""doers"" among military leaders (for example the leaders in the recent Gulf War) like I explained in this post  like his approach and they probably have reasons to do so. Rightly or wrongly, the strongmen of this world admire Rommel and in their world his name is still almost a byword for the good things about their profession (examples: 1 2 3 4 5 6  too many to list though) (ironically since he was never a strongman himself and never thought of himself as anything other than a military - yet notice the strange thing that the dictators seem to see his more political side: Gaddafi's models were ""Rommel and Louis XIV"", Pinochet ""Rommel and Napoleon"", Saddam ""Rommel and De Gaulle"" etc ). On the other hand, I've never seen ONE dictator who aspires to be a Montgomery or a Zhukov (people who were more careful and/or more 'strategic' and/or commanded larger forces). I can only say that the people ""high above"" seem to rate the ability of ""leading by one's own image"" very highly."

In fact, one of the games that kicked off the WW2-shooter-craze, Medal of Honor: Allied Assault, had quite a lot of enemy chatter that was genuinely funny - one conversation behind closed doors in a Nazi base has two soldiers wondering whether they're real or just characters in a movie - and ""humanized"" the enemy more than it demonized it. CoD 5: World at War even ramps up the grittiness of the Soviet's advance on Berlin to almost exploitative levels when the player character is forced by a superior officer to either gun down a group of surrendering soldiers or let them slowly be burned to death by his molotov-throwing comrades.

The main action of the uprising consisted of an armed civilian militia under the leadership of Friedrich Hecker moving from Konstanz in the direction of Karlsruhe with the intention of joining with another armed group under the leadership of Georg Herwegh there to topple the government. The two groups were halted independently by the troops of the German Confederation before they could combine forces. The Hecker Uprising was the first large uprising of the Baden Revolution and became, along with its leader, part of the national myth.

He built an unsustainable economic bubble which was on the verge of collapse and had to start a war leading to the German state literally ceasing to exist and it's industry reduced to rubble.  Did he successfully purge the Jews/Roma/Slavs/Commies/Trade Unionists/Gays/Jehovahs/Disabled people? Nope! Literally all of those groups still exist, and some of them are in fact more powerful and numerous than they were before.  Did he succeed in securing lebensraum for Germany, to make up for it's lack of overseas colonies? Nope! I mean, he sort of did for a while and then a big red dong came and hit him in the face so hard he committed suicide.  So even taking the bloodthirsty slaughter out of the equation (which is dumb), HITLER FAILED AT EVERYTHING HE EVER TRIED TO DO. HE WAS UTTERLY INCOMPETENT.

Generally, idealizing any historical figure is a bad idea. Pretty much anyone who died more than 100 years ago (hell, 50) is going to come off like a raging asshole to us if we look at him dispassionately. On the other hand, there's sometimes a tendency to pick heroes and villains based on finding certain traits more/less bad than others.   One of my favorite examples is Richard I. Partly in reaction to the mythology that built up around him, a counterjerk (involving not a few 18th-19th century historians, Churchill among them) developed where he's presented as the epitome of the incompetent, glory-hungry king who beggared England to fund his military adventures.

Hitler, on the other hand, by the lower end of the average estimates, killed 3/4 as many people as Stalin did in [i]five years.[/i]  Hitler's plans also called for the mass slaughter of Slavic populations and the enslavement of those that survived.  I would not say that Stalin was a good guy, nor that Poland 'did well' under the Soviet Union, but their policies in Poland were a picnic compared to what Germany had planned.  Just look at what happened to Poland's Jewish population.  A big chunk of Stalin's death count can be attributed to incompetence or poor planning, rather than malice, as well.  The great famines in the Soviet Union, while perhaps exploited with malicious intent, were the result of attempts at collectivization, not genocide.  And it's hard to argue 'genocide' when the whole USSR went hungry in that era.  Again, Stalin was a bad guy.  There's no arguing that.  But the difference between Stalin and Hitler is intent."

The Americans especially were often able to flash motorize divisions and get at least a handful of infantry regiments up in time to save an encirclement from a broken neck, such as during the formation of the small pocket at Roncey, containing some of the 2.SS and smaller remnants upwards of a regiment in size.  The Soviets also circumnavigated this problem with a more realistic approach of creating smaller breakthroughs, and therefore smaller pockets all along a front. The great proliferation of traditional horse mounted formations acting in conjunction with tank regiments helped as well, but its something that was unique to the nature of the Eastern front."

Still highly debatable if they had the strength to go for Moscow regardless, given the rapid formation of an entire new front there with STAVKA reserves. Driving south towards Kiev also kept Panzer supply lines relatively short + lateral compared to driving straight for Tula along the historic invasion route. It gives an unrealistic appreciation for how much strategic range and fighting strength they truly had left.  Flanking against a ruined enemy versus being the tip of a wedge against a prepared and manned line are two significantly different levels of strain for a mobile unit.

The failure was in not having sufficient strategic reserves and neglecting the Ardennes.   And that's a misapplied idea. The French in particular should have, or at least could have, recognized how much armor helps with breakthroughs of fortifications, and allow mobility. Not having a (mobile) strategic reserve is what created the chaos of the Battle of France.  But hey, between WW1 and WW2 was the largest change in possibilities in doctrine, and armies prepare to fight the last war. Fortifications worked for the French, and the Germans were on the receiving end of tanks. Vastly different lessons, there, at the face of it."

They did that pretty well. The error was in not applying that knowledge to a broader strategy.  They could have armour formations stationed behind the protected line, from there they could have operated and cut of german spear heads. Other strategic reserves to stop the from the front.

While the STG 44 was not the first assault rifle, it was probably the first mass produced assault rifle, and it clearly was a big design influence on the two most important rifles of the second half of the 20th century in the AK-47 and the M16."

Perhaps when it comes to engineering the Stg. 44 had no impact on the development of the AR-15 but just by existing, being able to be mass produced and being an effective weapon the Stg. 44 certainly had an impact on all assault rifles that followed, because, at the very least, weapons designers looked at the Stg. 44 and thought, ""hey, that's a good idea and we should make something similar."""

If they initially reacted to AK-47 with a lack of concern it doesn't change the fact that they fairly quickly adjusted.  You're also mixing the battle rifle concept with the assault rifle concept here.  The AK-47 was a poor battle rifle, but no discussion of the history of the assault rifle is complete without plenty of attention being paid to it.  The question here as I understand it, and this is not my area of any special knowledge, was not whether or not the AK was a good weapon, so much as the doctrinal question of whether an assault rifle was more useful than the US/NATO concept of a battle rifle firing a full power rifle cartridge.  In the end we know which side won that argument.  Just because the US Army took a long time to come around doesn't mean that Eugene Stoner (and others) weren't very aware of other developments and reacting to them.  Saying there is no relationship is almost like saying that there is no relationship between the A380 and the B747.  It's more or less true, but it's also overly simplistic and pedantic.  Ideas don't live in a vacuum.  So I don't exactly know what you're getting at.  The StG 44, Fedorov Avtomat, and M2 were all early developments of a concept, but none of them fully qualify as what we would call an assault rifle today and saying so in all three cases is a bit anachronistic.  I think what's important about the StG 44 is that it was mass produced and deployed in large numbers.  None of the weapons described were really fully developed and all three were developmental or stop-gap weapons.  We're talking about a period where there was rapid evolution in both doctrine and small arms design, so it's really hard to say that any of these weapons aren't related even if they don't have a direct lineage.  I don't disagree that the Avtomat was the first (somewhat) successful prototype of the class of weapons that entered service, but importantly it didn't continue in service.  Furthermore some of its assault rifle-like features were accidents rather than clearly thought out features to support an infantry doctrine.  It's not wrong to describe the StG 44 as the first assault rifle, but I think describing any of these weapons as such is sketchy, or at least subject to opinion, since there's more to it than simply the hardware and the doctrine only emerged late in WWII that brought the weapon into the forefront as the primary personal weapon for infantry.  Calling anything an assault rifle before this point is somewhat anachronistic."
ShitWehraboosSay,3aqcgb,irritatingrobot,-5,Mon Jun 22 20:27:53 2015 UTC,"In the end we know which side won that argument.   Neither as the US adopted a SCHV cartridge that is completely unlike either the 7.92 kurz or 7.62×39 cartridges and even then the AR-15 was meant as stopgap until the SPIW could be finished and that didn't even fire fucking bullets.   Just because the US Army took a long time to come around doesn't mean that Eugene Stoner (and others) weren't very aware of other developments and reacting to them.   But they never did come around, they all thought that the future was SCHV depending on who you asked that was either a cartridge in the ~.22 caliber range or even further and that it would be flechettes and not bullets.   US designers absolutely reacted to the appearance of the StG 44 and its predecessors on the battlefield, just not in a completely symmetrical manner and they took a while coming around to an assault rifle formula.    The assault rifle formula of the StG-44 and the AR-15 differ a lot in several fundamental ways.   think what's important about the StG 44 is that it was mass produced and deployed in large numbers. None of the weapons described were really fully developed and all three were developmental or stop-gap weapons.   Not much of an achievement when there was no ammo for the StG-44."

ShitWehraboosSay,3aqcgb,TitusBluth,3,Fri Jun 26 17:27:12 2015 UTC,"The original design of the M1 Carbine was select fire,    It is my understanding that the M1 was semi-automatic, it was not until the M2 that it became selective fire.   also the STG-44 had absolutely no impact on the development of AR-15.    It definitely did - even comparing the two visually there is a clear similarity. It's not my field of expertise, but taken from an AR15 enthusiast forum:    1.The two part reciever of the AR15 comes from the STG44. Eugene Stoner took a step forward by actually allowing the recievers to come apart from eachother. The way the bolt comes out the AR15 is also exactly like the way it comes out a STG44. The FAL also takes from the STG44 in that way. 2.The spring loaded buttstock of the M16 came from the STG44. 3.The thumb safety on the AR15 is in a similar location to the STG44's. 4. The magazine release on the M16 is quite similar to the STG44.   You forgot the dust cover on the M16 comes directly also from the STG 44, just turned upside down."
ShitWehraboosSay,3aqcgb,R_B_Kazenzakis,7,Mon Jun 22 18:00:14 2015 UTC,"That sounds more like parallel evolutionengineering. There are only so many ways to accomplish something.  Plus, the AR-15 is the first (widely available, at least) gas operated receiver, which makes any kind of inspiration by the StG 44 superficial at best.  Even Heckler & Koch decided to develop a battle rifle out of the MG 42 (The G-3 and MG-3), and not the StG 44."
ShitWehraboosSay,3aqcgb,burning_phoneix,0,Mon Jun 22 18:06:22 2015 UTC,"It is my understanding that the M1 was semi-automatic, it was not until the M2 that it became selective fire.   The original M1 Carbine was select fire but they dropped it save development time.   The two part reciever of the AR15 comes from the STG44.   While it's true both are two part the AR-10 receiver was not in any derived from the STG-44's receiver.   . The way the bolt comes out the AR15 is also exactly like the way it comes out a STG44.    This is meaningless as a lot of rifles the bolt comes out in a similar fashion.   The spring loaded buttstock of the M16 came from the STG44.    This is actually comes from Melvin Johnson's designs which predates the STG-44.   The thumb safety on the AR15 is in a similar location to the STG44's.  Maybe because there are few places you can fit a safety that makes sense.   The dust cover and magazine release is possibly derived from the  STG-44 though there is no solid evidence for this."
ShitWehraboosSay,3aqcgb,TitusBluth,11,Mon Jun 22 18:24:25 2015 UTC,"Where the wehraboos really get the STG-44 wrong is in acting like it just sort of sprang into existance in a vacuum and using it to support this narrative where the mighty STEM reich was light years ahead of everyone else and if they'd only had 6 more months...  By 1944 Germany was getting its ass handed to it on all fronts.  It was doing things like taking advanced prototypes and putting them directly into production because the only way they were going to win the war at that point was for some kind of miracle to happen. They needed something like the STG-44 because the Red Army that they ran rings around in 1941 were now doing things like arming whole companies with SMGs and setting them loose on the Germans, and the German army had no way to respond.   Far from being some kind of victory lap by the technological wizards of Nazi Germany the STG-44  was the result of a force that was hopelessly outclassed desperately clutching at straws until the very end.  Kind of a neat gun though, I guess."
ShitWehraboosSay,3aqcgb,TitusBluth,5,Mon Jun 22 23:14:54 2015 UTC,"Why it is clearly the M2 Carbine.   M2 Carbine was released in 1945. StG44 was in 1943. M1 Carbine was not selective fire and does not count.   so I will go to the opposite end of the spectrum and talk about the M14   Why? the Weapon came out after World War II.   it fires the intermediate T65 lightweight cartridge (better known as 7.62NATO)   This is debatable but the 7.62 NATO is sometimes not considered an ""intermediate"" round. It was derived from the .308 Winchester Round and not shortened or adapted for fully automatic fire. It delivers nearly as much energy the Russian 7.62x54 that was used in Bolt action rifles. A weapon with an effective range of nearly a kilometer."
ShitWehraboosSay,3aqcgb,slothscantswim,6,Tue Jun 23 09:48:20 2015 UTC,"This is debatable but the 7.62 NATO is sometimes not considered an ""intermediate"" round.   I don't think I've ever seen it called ""intermediate"" before. Obviously the distinction is ultimately semantic (if the 14.5mm Russian is your ""standard"" then a .50 BMG is an ""intermediate""!) but the way I've seen it used ""intermediate"" is reserved for chamberings that are too powerful to (conventionally) fire from a pistol yet light enough to control in a full-automatic rifle. The 7.62mm NATO's recoil is rather too heavy for practical automatic fire from a rifle.  Another way of looking at it is historically. Mainstream full power cartridges are in a ballpark in terms of muzzle energy, and 7.62mm NATO is actually at the high end of that range with 3470 Joules. By way of comparison, the 30-06 (a powerful round relative to other military rifle rounds) has 3610 Joules at the muzzle and the .303 British Mk. II loading has a mere 2980.  Yet another way would be to consider its function. The 7.62x39mm Soviet, the 5.66mm NATO, the 7.92×33mm Kurz etc. are all ""intermediate"" because they're supported by full-power small arms. If the 7.62mm NATO is intermediate, then NATO has two intermediate rounds and no full-power weapons, which makes no sense."
ShitWehraboosSay,3aqcgb,Ninjawombat111,2,Tue Jun 23 11:32:48 2015 UTC,"No one calls it a intermediate round.

A good case could maybe be made that taking the ports along North Afrika would make it harder for England to control the Mediterranean and supply Malta.  But Malta never seamed to be a the major objective for them.  Seams to me the hole North Afrika Campaign was lacking in Strategic Vision. As a tactician Rommel did Archive some success. Denying Britain the conquest of Tunis and taking the North African ports was good, however from there a defensive position would have been better.  In the end the strategic questions seams to be, how long can you keep the allies busy in North Africa so that the can not kick Italy out of the war and open the Mediterranean.   Its a pretty hard strategic problem, as long as you are set to invading Russia you have a pretty hard challenge on your hand pushing Britain out of Egypt and maybe the middle east.

Germany could provide enough logistical support for holding Africa. Local infrastructure could provide just enough throughput to support this.  Rommel 1 said, ""Cool, whatever. Let's conquer the Suez canal.

As for his lack of war crimes, the Jews ended their desert walkabout quite a few years before Rommel got on the scene, so he really didn't have the opportunity to be put to that particular test."

Turns out Mallmann and Cuppers claim that Rommel didn't even meet the guy who was sent to do the dirty job and never claim any of the above. Jean-Christoph Caron, one of the two authors of the TV doc they mentioned, also wrote an article about Rommel in that same year for Spiegel.

He never had any defensive strength which is why once he was blocked at El Alamein he had no chance at victory.    Except that Rommel literally wrote the book on teaching German infantry doctrine: Rommel, Erwin (1934). Gefechts-Aufgaben für Zug und Kompanie: Ein Handb. f. d. Offizierunterricht (in German). Mittler & Sohn  Rommel was an adequate commander (and loved by the rank and file, which contributed to the mythbuilding around Rommel), and his defensive emplacements turned Omaha Beach into a slaughter house. But he wasn't great. He was in a secondary theater, instead of fighting where the ""real"" war was, as far as Germany was concerned: Russia.  And, not to forget: His mandate was one of defense. That's what the Afrika Korps got, and what Rommel completely misunderstood. He failed at what German officers used to be really good at: reading the commander's intent and implementing it (he failed it so much so, that he made a joke out of his own training instilled in junior officers, and circumvented them).  The British traded land in fighting retreats in Africa, until the German lines of logistics were overstretched, the British lines were comfortably contracted, and the British could strike back. Montgomery had Rommel on the run almost as soon as Monty took command of the British forces.  To reiterate: Rommel was an adequate commander. He wasn't terrible, he wasn't great, he was average.

ShitWehraboosSay,3acgrx,seaturtlesalltheway,6,Fri Jun 19 17:28:24 2015 UTC,"Wow. The British used British tank doctrine in North Africa and got their asses handed to them repeatedly because they used tanks as support, not massing them into an offensive element. Also Rommel realized that open desert warfare was closer to sea warfare than conventional land battles, and therefore mobility, not infantry, would be the decisive factor in any engagement.  As for Rommel 'fighting defensively' in North Africa, I just want to know what you're smoking. He drove the British almost completely out of North Africa by constantly bringing the battle to them, and forcing them to battle on his terms, not by playing defense.   Was North Africa a 'secondary theater'? By amateur thinking, yes. But if Rommel had driven the British out of North Africa, the Mediterranean would have become impossible to hold by the Allies, and could then be used to drive the Allies out of the Middle East since the supply routes would have to travel through the Cape of Good Hope. And from there, instead of the moronic headlong rush into Russia, Germany could have invaded Russia from the south. So the Allies though that threat plausible enough to dedicate so much to defending Egypt."

Was the major problem not the shipping lines instead of the ports?  Also if you can capture forward ports you get a new base for operation and you can supply your force from there.

I'm fairly certain that's what they mean when they say Rommel was a competent tactician- he might loose the war but you could put him in a battle that might normally be lost and have him turn a win. Of course, winning the war is the part that matters.   I wouldn't discount his abilities, I'd just point out that he wasn't a good appointment as a general with basically no one who could step on his toes short of Berlin. He'd probably have been better suited in middle management than at the top.   I mean, no one in Germany could be claimed to have had competent logistical talent when you consider that they thought invading the Soviet Union was a good idea.

ShitWehraboosSay,3acgrx,tossaway4856,2,Sun Jun 21 06:21:52 2015 UTC,"From what I've observed, actually, it is the opposite. Until nowadays, it is the middle level leaders (aspiring strategists/strictly military people/historians and scholars who support the Halder school) who are not inclined to agree with Rommel. The ones who likely admire his train of thought and/or consider him their model/idol for whatever reason they have (I have some ideas regarding this, although one probably has to get to their level to see it) are ""action-man type"" generals and people who have come to the boundaries between political leader/spiritual leader /military leader. Say Pinochet, Ariel Sharon, Moshe Dayan, Schwarzkopf, Gaddafi, Musharraf,... and almost any modern dictator  I've tried to find out whose model they try to follow when they begin their career. They like and apply his mobile warfare system and concepts of soldier training that focused a lot on energy/flexible thinking/""human factor"". But the thing that they seem to like about him the most is spirituality/""spiritual leadership""/qualities that they think a ""strong man"" should possess.   Same with people in his era. Hitler and Churchill found him relatable. Hitler allowed him to join meetings which a man of Rommel's rank shouldn't have joined, and apparently according to Halder, relied on him as a scourge against Halder and co, since nobody dared to cross swords with him who was ""very brutal"" and had support from the highest places.  Goebbels thought that he could be the commander of the army. The OKW and other field marshals, on the other hand... Yet the same Rundstedt who labelled him a baby field marshal who should at best lead a division did encourage him to do it all on his own when asked about joining and leading the anti Hitler plot. Geyr von Schweppenburg, who was Rommel's main opponent regarding the Normandy defense plan, ultimately said ""yes"" when asked by Rommel whether he would follow him if Rommel's order was against Hitler's order (a bit too late of a choice though...), same with other generals in Normandy including the SS ones who thought Rommel was a huge nuisance who had never truly known war (and always made a big, unnecessary deal regarding the SS crimes). Juenger (who was called, probably rightly, the spiritual godfather of Naziism) explained it by the inexplicable ""Only Rommel possessed the naivety to face the terrible simplicity of those in authority and the double risk of war and civil war"".  In short gambling tacticians and/or ""idealistic visionaries"" who are half military half political (very often a crazy guy jumps from the former group to the latter) usually take Rommel's side while careful strategists who see war as a science won't (and those will more likely have time to write books voicing their opinions).  Not that he did not make mistakes or that the strategists don't have their points. I actually think that those people on the top are too inclined to let themselves be carried away by the folly, and Rommel is a huge example of over idealistic people shooting themselves in the feet in multiple ways and that his command style has its negatives. And if one day my country invades another I hope at least the overall commander will be someone that has some more prudence in him, like Caesar. But I also understand why he did it. He always thought that he was not political, but he was. He was against the elitism he saw in aristocratic officers and especially Italians -  he disliked the whole bunch of castle dwelling generals who (in his eyes) treated humans like pieces of chess and  lost Germany WW1. It was always about plan, plan, plan, Clausewitz and more Clausewitz. He wanted to break the old culture by providing an example, for the whole German people and army too. Rommel wanted a culture that focused on the small, the individual. Someone had to do it. Hitler tried to build up others like Dietrich and Dietl (who was sent to Finland; the main spotlight certainly should be reserved to Hitler himself) so that it looked balanced (Hitler liked Rommel a lot, but no dictator liked a too popular general), but no one possessed Rommel's charisma to pull it off to that level.  Regarding logistics, if you read the Rommel's Papers you will see that he cared about it much more than many German generals given the same military doctrine training did (they thought that Germany was a country that lacked natural resources so the only way that they had a chance was trying to win it fast whenever they could, pulling on thin strings), but he did not have full authority or information regarding the matter. He was also usually encouraged to make plans based on promises that later got unfulfilled. Not only he, but the others got ambitious too. He would take one port and was told to take another port that was more suitable for shipping so they could supply him.   Fighting a defensive battle (in the desert!) with an opponent that grew ever stronger was more complicated than it sounds. At the beginning for whatever reason Hitler didn't tell him that they were going to invade Russia too. Rommel was very angry when he found out.  Another thing was that his force was a mixed bag who answered not only to Hitler and the OKW but also the Italian military high command - Mussolini and so on. Rommel's dynamic style united them and gave them fire and the sense that the initiative belonged to them - them knowing they answered only to him. At some point Kesselring who also thought Rommel was crazy just gave up blaming Hitler for liking Rommel too much. Chiefs of staff (like Gause or Westphal) who were deemed to be more careful and more intellectual by Halder and co were sent to control Rommel but somehow they chose to follow him anyway, arguing that there was no other way around because desert warfare was different. I think only Mellenthin truly had a problem with his command style despite all the praises he gave him in the memoirs, but he probably thought it was better like that rather than rebelling against Rommel."

They weren't, not all. Most were just German men fighting for their country and people. I saw somewhere that the main reason the standard army kept fighting so hard on the Eastern front towards the end was to allow Germans to escape to the allies. To escape the horrors of what the Russian army could do. That's not evil if you ask me, and deserves to be remembered just the same.   Yeah its not ""evil."" But at the same time the Germans invaded Russia and refused to surrender. The Germans ""valiantly defending their homes"" is the reason the Russians had to invade in the first place. We don't honour the Germans who fought to the bitter end because they did nothing but prolong the war and lead to more deaths (including more German civilians).   The Jewish community however did not like this idea one bit, stating that it would be unfit to remember Germans when the victims of those nazi's would be present. They went to court to prevent this from happening. The judge agreed and the major was forbidden to include the German soldiers. additional picture:[1]   an aircraft rented by the Jewish community stating: ""Vorden is wrong"". In Dutch the word 'wrong' is also used to indicate someone is a traitor.   Da Joooz.    Check out the the work of Christopher Browning and Daniel Goldhagen. They both wrote books that examine why the Holocaust happened, especially in Germany. Goldhagen, in ""Hitler's Willing Executioners,"" says essentially that Germany was poised for this through a history of anti-semitism, along with other cultural values. Browning wrote ""Ordinary Men,"" which discusses how citizens put in the position to choose between their lives, and those of their family, or the lives of the undesirables. I tend to side with Browning but can see the arguments on both sides.   That's not even close to Browning's argument. Rather Browning argues that it was an informal system of peer pressure and blind obedience to higher authorities (isn't there a psychological test that corroborates this theory).   Years ago, before I ditched my old reddit account in a fit of anger and dispair, I tried telling someone just this. The dude called me a nazi sympathizer and referred to me as jerry. Reddit cheered him on.   I'll take things that didn't happen for 500 Alex.   History is written by the victor. All sides should be remembered even if it may not be politically correct.   SMH  Now for the crown jewel of shitiness, which I want to quote in full:   This Western-Allied ""logic"" still blows my mind:  When the Nazi fought the Soviets, the Soviets were the ""good guys who got surprisingly attacked by the evil Germans and only defended their own country"" and all the Eastern Europeans who collaborated with the Germans did it because they were ""evil"" too (one must be stupid to think it's because they were oppressed by the Soviets). At that time the US and the UK did massively support the Soviets and all the crimes committed by the Soviets were just ignored. For example the ethnic cleansing of the Germanic population or the massacre at the Polish elites in Katyn: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katyn_massacre But then suddenly, when the war in Europa was over in 1945, the Soviets became ""evil"" and it's that exact moment when they became a threat to the Western culture and freedom. This is so false.. Anyone interested in the true intention of Stalin should read this:  edit: Sorry, I just can't find the link anymore. There is some website where someone made a collection of Stalin's WW2 speeches (with link to the sources of course) and it becomes more than just clear that his true intention was to conquer whole Europe and fulfill his dream of an European Soviet-Union, including France, the UK, .. his first plan was to wait till both, the Germans and the Western-Allies become exhausted from war and then attack both. But when the French lost the war that quickly (he fought the war would become similar to WW1 and take several years) he immediately prepared for an attack on Germany, that's why his red army was not positioned in a defensive manner but preparing for an offensive and it's this very reason that made the German offensive so successful, and not (like the Soviet propaganda says) the missing military power  (in fact the red army was already MUCH bigger than the Germans Wehrmacht). People still call Hitler an idiot for starting a war at a second front and thus having to struggle with the same problem as in WW1, but they knew that the Soviets were preparing for an attack on Germany in the following months and their only option was a surprise attack before the Soviets were ready to start their own offensive (for which they were already preparing for a long time).   While strong ideologist like Himmler were talking about ""getting more life-space in the East"" and ""must defeat the Untermenschen"" the normal Soldier actually thought that they need to fight the Soviets because they were threatening Germany, which is actually not that far from reality (actually..it's the truth). If you now also consider the fact that most of the German military action took place in the East you might get a different picture of the German soldiers.  http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/51/World-War-II-military-deaths-in-Europe-by-theater-year.png   That is without a doubt, the stupidest shit I have ever read, and I've read some stupid shit.   Damn right. American soldier who kills many German soldiers- ""What a hero! We should celebrate his victory against those... eviiiil Nazis, repeat after me, German Nazi bad!""

I used to work with him at a factory and he was the older brother of a classmate of mine. We were talking at a party my cousin threw and started talking politics. After something like 15 min I say 'Dude, you're a fucking nazi!'. I hadn't known previously.  To which he replied: 'Not so! I'm a neo nazi!'. I'm from Denmark. We call them nynazister. As you can guess ny means new. And neo means new. But he insisted on saying neonazist instead of nynazist and saying that was a huge difference. He refused to believe that neo literally meant new.

Those are the tradeoffs you make, and given their commerce-raiding mission it was probably a good one.  They get overhyped a bit (""Pocket Battleships"", lol) but they were good ships for the first generation of heavy cruisers. Remember that their peers are Northampton, Takao, and York, not Baltimore.

First described by Polish journalist and author Igor Witkowski in Prawda o Wunderwaffe (2000), it was later popularized by military journalist and author Nick Cook as well as by writers such as Joseph P. Farrell and others who associate it with Nazi occultism and antigravity or free energy research.  According to Patrick Kiger writing in National Geographic magazine, Die Glocke has become a popular subject of speculation and a following similar to science fiction fandom exists around it and other alleged Nazi ""miracle weapons"" or Wunderwaffen.  Mainstream reviewers such as former aerospace scientist David Myhra express skepticism that such a device ever actually existed.

Are wehraboos getting so lazy as to fail to actually check if the links they're posting actually support their claims?  The Smithsonian goes on to debunk the stealth claim.  From: the long description tab   They apparently did not believe that Reimar shaped the Ho 229 solely for aerodynamic reasons, that the jet was simply one in a long line of all-wing Horten aircraft, and that there exists no physical or documentary evidence to support Horten's claims. His story is weak for several other reasons. Allied ships were equipped with air-search radar; however, these were low-priority targets for the Luftwaffe compared to the waves of heavy bombers that had pounded Germany day and night from the beginning of summer 1943. Germany needed vast numbers of interceptors capable of penetrating the screens of Allied fighters protecting the bombers, not long-range strike aircraft with low RCS. Oddly enough, neither Reimar nor Walter Horten mentioned to Allied intelligence specialists immediately after the war the RCS techniques that Reimar claimed in 1983 he applied to the Ho 229 during the war, a peculiar omission in light of Reimar's strong interest in resuming his work with an Allied aviation firm. Finally, if the Ho 229 was as speedy as Reimar estimated, why would the aircraft need to evade radar detection when it could outrun any Allied fighter?"

Broadly speaking, there have been two camps. One insists that the Wehrmacht was the ""untarnished shield"", an apolitical force that had little to do with Nazism, kept its distance from the regime, had nothing to do with the criminal policies of the regime, and was even a bastion of resistance. The second camp argues that the Wehrmacht started out as a loyal part of the regime, became increasingly integrated into the regime as time went by, and argues the Wehrmacht was a genocidal organization.

ShitWehraboosSay,3a1w58,IAmNotAnImposter,8,Tue Jun 16 19:38:51 2015 UTC,"Thing is, the Nazis got a free pass (Barbarossa Decree) for committing war crimes while the Soviets not so much.  From: Artem Drabkin's interview of Vasili Pavolovich Bryukhov although the version I'm quoting is from the book ""T-34 in Action"" since it has better formatting.   But there was an incident at Krajovo in Romania, where we stopped for three days to repair our tanks and await the supply units. One of the tank commanders in our battalion was Lieutenant Ivanov, from the Belgorod area. He was thirty-five years old, a Communist who’d been chairman of a kolkhoz before the war. His village was occupied by Romanian troops while he was at the front, and during their retreat they took away all the young villagers and put the Communist party members and their families into a barn and burnt them alive. It was only when our brigade passed near his home village, and he requested permission to visit it, that Ivanov learnt of this. His neighbours told him how the poor people had yelled and cried as the barn was drenched with petrol, and how the Romanians had fired through the barn walls to finish them off. This is how Ivanov’s family died – his wife and two children.  When Ivanov rejoined the brigade he was a different man. He started to seek revenge. He fought very hard – sometimes it seemed as if he was seeking death – and he didn’t take any prisoners: if someone tried to surrender to him, he killed them immediately.  But in Krajovo it happened like this. He and his driver got drunk and went into town to look for female company. It was September, a nice autumn evening. They walked into a house where an older man and a young woman of about twenty-five were drinking tea. The woman had an eighteen-month-old baby with her. Ivanov took the baby and gave it to the young girl’s parents, and told the girl to go into another room. Then he said to his driver: ‛You go fuck her first, I’ll go second.’ So the driver went into the room. But he was only eighteen years old and most likely he’d never been with a woman before. Sensing his inexperience as he started to undress her, the girl managed to jump out of the window and ran away. Ivanov, hearing the noise, rushed into the room: ‛Where is she? You son of a bitch, you let her get away!’ Then he fired one burst through the window with his SMG and the girl fell down. The two of them gave the matter no further thought and left. If Ivanov had wanted to deliberately kill her he’d have definitely missed, as he was drunk, but he’d fired without taking aim. Only one bullet hit her, but it went straight into her heart.  The next day her parents and the local mayor came to the brigade headquarters, and the day after that Smersh discovered the criminals and arrested them. Ivanov confessed right away that he’d shot at the girl, but he hadn’t realised that he’d killed her.  The court-martial took place on the third day after the tragedy. The entire brigade stood in formation in a field, and the mayor and the girl’s parents were also present. The driver was crying like a baby. Ivanov said to him: ‛Be a man! They won’t execute you, so stop sobbing. They’ll just send you to a penal company and you’ll redeem your honour with your blood.’ And that’s how it turned out. The driver was sentenced to twenty-five years’ imprisonment, commuted to service in a penal company.  When Lieutenant Ivanov was asked if he had anything to add, he stood up and said: ‛Comrade judges, I committed a crime and I ask you not to show me any mercy.’ Just like that, simply and firmly. Then he sat down and calmly picked his teeth with a grass stem.  Then they announced his sentence: execution in front of the entire brigade, the sentence to be carried out immediately.  It took us some fifteen minutes to fall in. They stood Ivanov in front of a grave that had been dug beforehand. The lieutenant-colonel who was the brigade osobist told our battalion osobist, who was standing with the rest of us: ‛Comrade Morozov, execute the sentence.’ The latter didn’t move. ‛I’m ordering you!’ Still Morozov didn’t move an inch. Then the lieutenant-colonel grabbed him by the arm and pulled him out of the ranks, calling him the worst obscenities: ‛I’m ordering you!’ Only then did Morozov walk over to Ivanov.  Lieutenant Ivanov took off his side-cap, bowed to us and said: ‛Forgive me, brothers.’ That was it. Morozov said to him: ‛On your knees.’ He said it very quietly, but everyone heard – there was an awful silence in the air. Ivanov knelt down, putting his cap under his belt. ‛Bend your head forward,’ said Morozov. When he bent forward our osobist shot him in the back of the head, and Ivanov fell to the ground and jerked in agony. It was a horrible sight.  Morozov turned and walked away with the smoking gun in his hand, swaying from side to side as if he was drunk. The lieutenant-colonel shouted: ‛A control shot! A control shot!’ But Morozov walked on without hearing. Then the lieutenant-colonel himself ran to Ivanov and fired one, two, three rounds at his head. I remember that although Ivanov was already dead, his body still jerked at every shot.  The lieutenant-colonel pushed the body into the grave with his foot: ‛Bury him.’ So it was done. ‛Dismissed!’ But everyone stood frozen in formation for fifteen minutes. There was a dead silence. Ivanov had always fought well, and was a respected officer, and everyone knew that the Romanians had burnt his family alive. He could have asked for mercy, and he could have said that the girl’s death was an accident, but he didn’t. After this we had no more incidents with the local population in our brigade."
ShitWehraboosSay,3a1w58,irritatingrobot,4,Wed Jun 17 11:47:00 2015 UTC,I remember reading that certain writers were arrested when the Soviets realised that their soldiers behaviour would cause German resistance. The writers articles were though to be too revengeful.
ShitWehraboosSay,3a1w58,derpman5000,2,Wed Jun 17 15:00:02 2015 UTC,"Ilya Ehrenburg was criticized in Pravda for going too far with his anti German rhetoric. This was seen as a signal that what was considered appropriate was changing as the war was winding down. At the same time the Red Army was doing things like having whole companies sit down and write up lists of every bad thing any Germans had ever done to them or their familes on the eve of the Battle of Berlin, so the idea that this phase of the war was about revenge was something they were promoting with one hand while discouraging with the other.   The USSR was hardly blameless in its behavior in WWII, both in terms of individual soldiers and in terms of their actions as a nation. The Soviet way of war required tremendous sacrifices by their soldiers, and the way they kept up that level of commitment when the war shifted from being a defensive war on their own home soil to being about facing the dragon in his den was to encourage their troops to see it as revenge for past wrongs, to tacitly encourage a huge amount of looting and so on, and to look the other way to a greater or lesser extent when it came to moral atrocities commited by their troops.   Of course what they were doing was fairly small potatoes both in terms of scale and in terms of official intent compared to what the Nazis were about, but the only real way to win the ""oppression olympics"" is not to play at all. Two wrongs don't make a right, there's literally nothing the Russians could do to magically erase the evil shit the Nazis did."

I actually don't mind cussing but I prefer it under moderation in my games. I prefer a server where saying 'fuck you' is banned as it keeps things civil. As can often be seen here on Reddit for instance, people really don't do self moderation well.  Another key thing is: at least on those servers nobody really cared who won or lost. It was a community built around having fun with TF2 in a family friendly atmosphere. It was a pretty large community and the public servers were always full so I guess people liked playing there.   Rules were simple. Swearing gave a warning and then a ban for a second offence. Racial or sexual slurs led to instant and never reversible ban and mocking on the forums when they came to plead their innocence in the face of chat logs. Those rules would be posted on the server and if someone can't read the house rules and abide by them I think it's fair to kick them out.

There's also such a thing as a perfectly fair observation that this isn't the 80s, and video games don't occupy the cultural niche they once did. Accusing people of ""culture war"" for acknowledging that is on par with denouncing banks as destroyers of American culture for adding a Spanish-language option to their ATMs.   You are however a gamer.

I mean, no, you need to take a step back and look at what you're doing when a singular hobby informs so much of your identity, but that's not exactly the issue here. Games Journalism- joke that it is- has had a habit of shitting on the community for years at this point, suggesting that being critical of, say, a game's ending means you're entitled.  Yeah, we get it. You're baiting for clicks.  The issue was that when there was a clear instance where a writer was promoting their friend- who they were having sex with- while in the same breath claiming to be journalists- which would suggest you're maintaining some measure of unbiased reporting- that are trying to give voices to the voiceless. And this was the same female developer who claimed that Wizardchan had raided her- while being unable to maintain a consistent narrative on how it happened, or produce evidence that suggests it did happen- and later successfully killed an organization trying to get women into games development when she claimed they were transphobic because they asked that applicants sign off on their gender by a given date. She would later doxx them, including a third party donor who had wished to remain anonymous in all this, the subsequent doxxing caused them to withdraw from the venture.  And in the middle of all this clear abuse of positions and power, what happens? Threads on reddit get nuked from high orbit claiming they're trying to doxx Quinn- there is no evidence to suggest this actually happened, and if anything the one thread that was allowed on the topic actually reported that compared to other meta threads it required fairly little moderator involvement- 4chan's m00t insists there's nothing of substance to the movement and bans all discussion on it, even from ""free speech"" boards, and several other social media sites along with the journalists all close ranks and say, ""Nope, nothing here, and in fact, Fuck you for suggesting otherwise!"" The issue couldn't be any more cut and dry. Journalists were absolutely not doing their due diligence in investigating claims made by people and were not making the barest of effort to ensure there was a clear line between journalist and glorified PR person. Developers and publishers should be afraid of journalists, not in bed (literally or otherwise) with them.   I've always maintained that much like how if we all ignored Anita Sarkesian, she likely would have gone away, had GG been handled better- even the mildest of concessions that it's probably an issue for a reporter to be sleeping with the subject of the article he's writing, since in actual journalism this typically gets people fired or severely sanctioned- it might have lasted a month, maybe two. Instead we're nine months into it, and boards that really shouldn't have to exist- KiA for one- are only getting bigger by the day.   I will freely concede that GamerGate is dumb, but their core argument isn't exactly wrong, and frankly I'm going to applaud anything that takes 7 figures away from a website circle like the Gawker network."

He wrote an essay in the late 60s about Stalin, and he described how Stalin worked to breed distrust among all his commanders, so that they would compete for the laurels. When he was being kicked around after the war, a number of Generals - Chuikov, Konev, Rokossovsky, etc. - badmouthed him bad, so in his memoirs he settles a lot of scores, in some cases returning the favor, or in others - like Chuikov, barely mentioning him.

Zhukov claims that he tried to insist against it, but that Stalin practically forced him to. Either way, it is clear that Stalin, who hated the Poles, would never stand to see an ethnic Pole command the force taking Berlin.  As for Khrushchev, the irony is that it is specifically because Zhukov saved him that Khrushchev threw him aside.

This created tension between ZANU-PF supporters and whites... The government continued its attempts to blame the country’s economic and political problems on the white minority and Western countries. ZANU-PF supporters seldom were arrested or charged with infringing upon minority rights, particularly the property rights of the minority white commercial farmers or wildlife conservancy owners targeted in the land redistribution program.

It gets problematic when you get people like Beevor who simply use birth rates as their evidence. Because clearly, every German woman who had sex with a Soviet soldier did so at gunpoint, right? Prostitution is definitely NOT a thing, and it certainly doesn't tend to thrive wherever there are large armies! Never mind that some German women might have just liked some Red Army soldiers enough to have sex with them.

Arguably, the most honorable thing to do would have been to resign at the outset.   Zhukov, on the other hand, was helping Stalin to fight a defensive war.  I don't think anyone can realistically question the morality of fighting a defensive war against an aggressor, especially one with the avowed goal of exterminating your people.

It's difficult to judge people then by standards today. At the time, Colonialism was still in full force and invading and annexing territory wasn't seen as horribly as it was today.  Then again, Zhukov was a high ranking officer in an Army that participated in the annexation of Poland, The Annexation of the Baltic states and the Invasion of Finland.  Sure, Zhukov wasn't directly involved in those but he wasn't stupid. He could clearly see that Stalin was using the Red Army to expand Soviet influence by force.  At this point, Zhukov could have resigned and perhaps returned to service when the Germans attacked.  But he didn't. He was assigned Commander of the Southern Front ready to invade Romania and the only thing that stopped the invasion was Romanian capitulation to Soviet demands.

ShitWehraboosSay,39s0pj,buy_a_pork_bun,-3,Sun Jun 14 15:12:56 2015 UTC,"yes http://www.bartleby.com/73/2070.html   There are two kinds of mines; one is the personnel mine and the other is the vehicular mine. When we come to a mine field our infantry attacks exactly as if it were not there. The losses we get from personnel mines we consider only equal to those we would have gotten from machine guns and artillery if the Germans had chosen to defend that particular area with strong bodies of troops instead of with mine fields. The attacking infantry does not set off the vehicular mines, so after they have penetrated to the far side of the field they form a bridgehead, after which the engineers come up and dig out channels through which our vehicles can go."
ShitWehraboosSay,39s0pj,phoenixbasileus,6,Sun Jun 14 13:47:40 2015 UTC,"Ah yes I remember reading about this from a while ago. From what I remember, the soviet general staff calculated around 1943 that the casualties were about the same regardless if soldiers ran through or engineers stopped to disarm the infantry mines under fire, but since the infantry attacking method didn't sacrifice speed it was preferred.   A crude tactic, but in this case the soldiers were following the logic of Stavka."

Several memoirs about him details how he disliked religion as a whole and that it had no place in Nazism since Nazism was based purely on science. It's been said he wanted to get rid of all religious influence in Germany, even at the behest of some of his close followers like Bormann, and abroad but Christianity was more of a long-term goal then short-term like Judaism and other smaller sects of Christianity.   He also thought Himmler was mad for pushing the SS into the occult, even speaking out against it as it went against his views of Nazism.  Lutherans and Catholics altogether were persecuted just the same as those above and so were many Christians in high power who spoke out against Nazism. Many priests were denounced, arrested, and sent to concentration camps without a second thought.  More information"

I like their cunning method of spelling all the controversial names in Engrish, and adding -ia to all the countries. That of course makes it completely apolitical, as we all know.   Hitora is the dictator of Germania. Stubborn yet daring, it is her dream to conquer Europa and unite the continent under one banner.   Are we forgetting something here? Like another thing that Hitler was trying to do? There couldn't be some major event that we're denying here could there?   despite her sweet looks, she [Stalin] is not to be trusted   Can't see how that could be considered political.   [Charles de Gaulle] Can be very sneaky and is known to lie   Nope, not political at all.   [Mussolini] Rather boisterous and happy-go-lucky, although very clumsy.   That was close. I almost went a whole day without the internet reminding me that WW2 Italy was nothing but a big joke.   Hitora's former tactician who has gone missing in the desert. Where could such a brilliant mind have vanished to? [You have three guesses as to who this is referring to]   Probably the most realistic scenario so far. Getting lost in a desert is exactly the kind of thing I'd expect Rommel to do.   There is one main route in this game.   The one where she shoots herself in a bunker? I doubt it somehow.   Then again, there are possible bad ends if you’re not ‘leveled up’ enough to defeat certain enemies.   So that's a no. If only Hitler had won in real life, we could have gotten the ""good"" ending!   Britannia, Franzo and Sovia. Each enemy will vary in difficulty.   Ah yes, just like in the real war. That's why Germany waited until 1941 to attack the Soviets, Hitler was giving the war a difficulty curve. I was wondering though, where the hell is the US in all this?   A short comedic cutaway involving the President of the US talking to an agent   Oh of course. They're the comedy relief.   Tender moments between yourself and the dictators, historical backstory, romance, comedy    We all know Hitler-chan's just a big tsundere.   and hopefully a cheeky bit of fanservice.   I've already seen Hitler's panties once. I think I'll pass this time.   Watch as she [Hitler] slowly falls deeper and deeper in love, and unlock all her CGs   Help."

The reason the right flank was left wide open was simple: The Iraqis considered that area of trackless desert to be impassable. They had trouble navigating large enough forces in that completely empty terrain. They had no idea that the United States GPS systems (A new development at the time) would eliminate that problem.    Iranian infantry from the Iran-Iraq war were nothing particularly special. They were innovatively and aggressively led, but by and large they were poorly trained and provided with limited armament. And they were always outnumbered overall.    This is wrong, Iranian Infantry had always outnumbered Iraqi Infantryman with the possible exception of the very start of the war before mass mobilization by the Iranians took place."

I'm fairly certain that while Iran could raise more troops, they didn't have the logistical network to get them up to the front. To quote Arabs at War:  ""By early 1988, the Iraqi military outnumbered Iran in every category of military manpower and hardware. Iraq boasted roughly 1,000,000 men under arms, while Iran could only field 600,000; Iraq had over 4,000 functional tanks, while Iran had less than 1,000; Iraq had over 600 combat aircraft, while Iran could surge less than 50. At the point of attack, Iraqi advantages were even greater, with force ratios of ten to one, twenty to one, and even fifty to one in certain categories not uncommon. On top of this, Iraq relied on massive doses of chemical agents to overwhelm Iranian defenders. Given the disparities, what is surprising is that the Iraqis could not do more.""  p.232"

ShitWehraboosSay,399nn8,eddie_pls,20,Wed Jun 10 09:01:40 2015 UTC,"I actually decided to entertain a hypothetical where all of German war materiel from 1939 to 1945 was magically teleported including all the resources imaginable to the border of Iraq and Germany had the objective to take it.  So this means that there would be 22 million (or thereabouts) soldiers against 1.6 million (Iran-Iraq War numbers). Here's the German equipment numbers drawn from rough estimates of all years combined:  -Tanks: 50,000 (being REALLY generous and including sub-types and Panzers I-VI)  -Bomber Aircraft: 18,500  -Fighter Aircraft: 53,000  -All military aircraft total: 93,000.  Now we have to assume that Germany can gain 100% utilization of these arms. These are approximations rounded up.  And now we'll use Iraqi numbers approximated from 1991. (source, needs verification.http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/iraq/ground-equipment-intro.htm)  Iraqi Tanks numbered about 4.2k, 2.8k AFVs, and 2.1k artillery pieces. in other words, Iraq would be horrifically outnumbered. But, there's a kicker. Optics and radar. Assuming that logistics (fuel and munitions) were both relatively plentiful initially and a non-concern. If all of the Wehrmacht's strength was levied against a 1991 Iraq, I would prefer Pre-Iran-Iraq War Iraq since it makes the numbers ever so slightly more fair..given that the Wehrmacht gets 17x or so more troops. So with this in mind we'd have to evaluate that, because if it was only the 1944 production, Germany would lose. Terribly. It would be a slight numerical advantage for Germany and an incredibly ridiculous equipment disparity.  So let's keep imagining this because this is getting /r/askreddit levels of hypothetical. If Germany could field ALL of it's equipment doctrine would determine it's effectiveness. Unfortunately due to SPAA on the Iraqi's behalf being much more effective thanks to optics and radar, launching bombing offensives would be nigh impossible until the Iraqi forces in an area are overwhelmed. We would have to assume insane kill ratios thanks to better optics and radar for anti-aircraft and regular Iraqi jets absolutely destroying the Luftwaffe's 93,000 aircraft.  Now the inevitable conclusion is that Iraq would lose. But only if Germany had 6 years worth of man power and equipment to overrun Iraq.  Think of it this way. Panzer Is and Panzer IIs could be taken out by 14.5mm KPV Machine Gun emplacements. RPG-7 ambushes could disable tanks in swathes. The only problem is that the Iraqi forces literally have the numerical misfortune of being only 7% as large in my hypothetical. Assuming that there's enough pilots, and room to fit all of these munitions, Germany would indeed win. But only if they had enough munitions to flood the entire country. The claim that 1944's worth of equipment would be a slaughter of the Germans. A vicious inhumane slaughter where the Germans could never retaliate.  What's the lesson? 30 years of equipment development is an obscene force multiplier. Combined with the short operational range of most of the German equipment (and that not a lot of it would work well in the hot climate of Iraq) and the logistical supplies, the assumption of full mobilization would be weak. Not to mention many losses and overly-redundant and useless equipment would actually be a detriment.  The good news is that it would take a small force of about 250-300 to take out the entire production run of Tiger Is and Tiger IIs with RPGs. So that would be fun to watch.   Tl;DR don't underestimate engagement ranges, optics, logistics, operational ranges, movement capabilities, and equipment design philosophy as well as tactics and strategy. Iraq would lose in my hypothetical, but Germany would've lost so much material that it would've been embarrassing.   Edit: A defense in depth making a German advance as difficult as possible would be sufficient. As long as the advance is slowed down and the aircraft are kept at bay, there wouldn't be a possible victory for Germany. That's what 30 years of technology and strategy develop. Eventually Iraq would be overrun if the Germans managed an incredibly large flank but there's so many insane factors that this hypothetical was conceived to suggest how ludicrous this claim is.  Edit Edit: I forgot to mention that at one point, I'm not even sure all those delicious Aryan soldiers could advance. There'd be too many dead bodies and wrecked vehicles in the way.. And surprise attacks are out of the question thanks to far better recon.. So I dunno. As long as the Iraqis had fuel and ammo. They'd win."

I don't have to be a Wehraboos just to admit Eisenhower HATED Germans, and not just Nazis. In fact, he said on many an occasion ""God, I hate Germans."", over and over.  He was enacting punishment, or more precisely... exacting revenge on POWs and civilians. War is fucked. If a good reason existed to hate an entire people, that was the closest thing to it. Eisenhower must have seen some horrific shit.  Patton complained to higher ups about him, and Eisenhower in turn complained about Patton when he just let POWs walk home instead putting them in camps.  Patton said once, ""It is no more possible for a man to be a civil servant in Germany and not have paid lip service to the National Socialists than it is for a man to be a postmaster in America and not have paid at least lip service to the Democratic Party or the Republican Party when they are in power.""  To be fair, Patton may have been thinking more strategically than morally. He saw mending relations with Germans as more strategic in the upcoming showdown with Russia.  I don't agree with that. I think stuff like Operation Paperclip was just WRONG, period. People like Von Braun should have been tried at Nuremberg.  So yeah, all I'll say is... more people died or suffered than was necessary.

We hear a lot about the supposed death camps where Eisenhower starved a million-odd disarmed enemy combatants, but it's mostly coming out of a discredited book by a guy named James Bacque. My understanding of the situation is that Europe was in a major famine in 1945, and recently surrendered German soldiers were placed at the very bottom of the totem pole for what little food was available; despite that, the death toll was in the thousands, not the tens of thousands or millions.  I never accused you of being a Wehraboo."

I don't know what to give you for links. This is my impression from past books I have read, not the one you mention.

Euphemisms become fact, defeats become merely setbacks. We've seen this line of thought before. We know its objectively wrong. When and how did the article being criticized reach the conclusion that the 'tank attack was turned back?' It attacked across 3 and 1 half miles of open ground, allowed accompanying infantry to detruck and begin an attack on Troyes, and stopped at the R. Seine; a water obstacle. The German reaction was a rather confused flight, continued resistance in town, or capitulation. In short, it achieved its limited objective, and halted. This would merely be a discrepancy in narratives if it wasn't clearly obvious that the feldgrau piece was attempting to make a point.  The feldgrau article notes that French Resistance over-run the HQ, not the Americans. This would be significant, and I find it odd that 80 years on the American authors would somehow be suffering from a blow to their ego hard enough to cut them out of the narrative. Blumenson and Fox both mention FFI units mopping up resistance in forests and pointing out (and in extraordinary instances, clearing) minefields in and around Troyes. I would give the feldgrau article the benefit of the doubt if either Blumenson or Fox had failed entirely to mention the FFI, but they don't."

Thing is, most amateurs like us tend to count rivets, rather than riveting machines, and thus fall into the same trap as the Nazis: paper strength large = military great.  It doesn't help that popular military history focuses on technology and battles, rather than supplies and doctrine. You know, actual military science and history."
ShitWehraboosSay,393bt6,seaturtlesalltheway,28,Tue Jun 9 14:15:49 2015 UTC,"In nearly every airial conflict, Luftwaffe took 10 Russian planes for every one they lost, that statistic is staggering given the numbers that swarmed them.   Ignoring the utterly awful spelling of aerial, and the fact that David Irving is his source, this statistic only works if the war ended around 1942. As it so happens WWII went on for another three years and in the following time planes like the Yak-9 and the La-5 were introduced to the fighters and doctrine involving the IL-2 began to become better refined. This isn't to discredit German pilots, but counting the loss of IL-2s is hardly fair given that the German Stuka losses were just as numerous (although not as disastrous because by 1941 the Germans had far better training than the VVS in 1941).  We also have to understand that it wasn't 100:1. That KDR would never have made sense. A lot of the of the discrepancies in kills are also equalized later. The early Russian war effort being rather markedly terrible due to the breakdown in command thanks to the purges and the rather terrible equipment and communicative ability between the army and the VVS. The Germans were better. Until 1942. By 1942, German Air Superiority was gone. No matter how good they were in the beginning (which I will never deny that the Luftwaffe and the Wehrmacht were pretty damn successful, in fact that's exactly how I would've invaded Russia if my goal was to invade Russia), the tables had turned by Stalingrad. The former successes gave way to failures due to a multitude of reasons, including a lack of resources.   ""The ONLY plane that contended with the Wulf's speed and maneuverability was the mustang, that is congruent in both German and American veteran pilot conversations.""   Funnily, the Griffon based Spitfires were faster than any FW190 variant aside from the Jumo-213 or the TA-152. In fact all the late version P-47s, P-51s and Tempests were only topped by either the jets or really late rarely produced planes.  This is even weirder when the metric for maneuverability is not explicit. The Focke-wulf's abilities were not to be doubted, but it wasn't the perfect plane. If anyone else wants me to go on I shall, but for now I'll leave you with how this post sounds in music form.  As an aside, I really try to not jerk too hard on the side of the anti-Wehrmacht because the Nazi military was rather impressive in the early stages of the war. The problem is that as the war grew on, it committed to something greater than itself. A force that's called ""technologically superior, tactically superior, and overall superior,"" is patently false. If you add ""until 1943"" I might be willing to be charitable and maybe give some credence to it.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-LIPFgMcVA"

Yes, ONLY the Mustang. And the Spit Mk IX, plus the Griffon variants. And the hot-rod P-47s. And Tempests. Right, AMONGST the planes that could contend with a Fw 190 were such diverse elements as... I'll come in again...   FW 190 and maneuverability... if he's going to mention something exemplary out of the FW, it might as well be something it actually had an advantage in like firepower or ruggedness.   Almost as amusing as that, is the fact Soviet pilots thought the Bf 109G was better than the FW 190.   From: ""Barbarossa & the Retreat to Moscow: Recollections of Fighter Pilots on the Eastern Front"" by Artem Drabkin   Nikolai G. Golodnikov Interviewed by Andrei Sukhrukov  The Bf 109G was a powerful aircraft, fast and very good in vertical manoeuvre. It was not bad in horizontal manoeuvre but it appeared late, only in 1943, when all our regiments had already been equipped with modern aircraft. Overall, in its tactical and technical characteristics, it was on a par with the Yak-1B (7B, 9), La-5, and P-39 Airacobra, and a bit better than the P-40.  The Fokker [FW 190 – Ed.] also was a powerful and fast aircraft, but as a fighter it was inferior to the Bf 109G. It did not accelerate as quickly and was not as capable in the vertical plane. In terms of acceleration speed the Fokker was indeed weak and in this aspect was inferior to most of our aircraft, except for the P-40 perhaps. The Fokker was extremely powerful and therefore was often employed as an attack aircraft armed with bombs.  ...  The Fokker was very good in a dive – this is true of all German fighters. It must be said that the Bf 109G and FW 190 carried very powerful weapons, with five and six firing points respectively, for the most part cannon. This was a very strong aspect of German aircraft. Nevertheless, with regard to the FW 190, although it was a powerful fighter its combat qualities were not unique in any way. Overall, I got the impression the Germans had high expectations for this aircraft but definitely overestimated it.  For example, who ever gave them the idea that the Cobra was inferior to the Fokker in speed? But they believed it! At first the Germans were so confident in their speed superiority that after an attack, a Fokker would attempt to break away from us at full throttle at engine boost. You would catch up with him and pour it on him from above. He would huff and puff but couldn’t break away. We quickly taught the Germans not to rely on their engine power boost. Later it became a rule with Fokkers to break off an attack or evade fire only by means of a steep dive, no other method.  The Fokker was also inferior to the Cobra in the vertical plane, although they initially attempted to contest it with us. But they had to quickly abandon that habit. I don’t understand why they decided the Fokker could outperform the Cobra in the vertical plane.  The acceleration rate of the Fokker was another weakness. Later they attempted to plan their manoeuvres so they would not lose speed. But in a prolonged battle of manoeuvre a Fokker would lose against a Yak, Lavochkin or Cobra. He lost his speed and then it was over, as he could be shot down more than once while regaining speed.  Although the Fokker made a big impact on the Western Front it was employed as an interceptor, while in the East it was used as a front-line fighter. In the West, Fokkers were guided to their targets by radar: so by the time contact was made with the enemy, the Fokkers had managed to accelerate and gain altitude superiority. In this scenario the low acceleration rate of the Fokker didn’t play a major role because it had already acquired speed and altitude. But on our front the Germans didn’t have that level of radar support, as radar stations were not nearly as numerous. In fact both we and the Germans largely used visual means to detect the enemy. When there was no radar support, rate of acceleration played a crucial role, and the Fokker was quite average in this respect."
ShitWehraboosSay,393bt6,LeuCeaMia,5,Tue Jun 9 01:50:55 2015 UTC,"While the 190 was a rugged design, I doubt it had anything over the Hellcat or P-47 in that regard."
ShitWehraboosSay,393bt6,IronWorksWT,4,Tue Jun 9 03:40:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, although it's probably hardier than most inline powered planes, it wasn't particularly durable for a radial engined craft.  Here's the part I cut off because the post was getting too long.   I can say that the Fokker engine was significantly more durable and could take more damage than that of the Messer. If the Fokker lost two cylinders it could still fly. Though increased reliability and resistance to damage are characteristic for all radial engines in comparison to in-line engines, German engines were not quite at the level of our own in this regard. Our I-16 and La-5 could lose four cylinders and still make it home. The Fokker could not lose more than two and still fly.  German pilots liked frontal assaults on FW 190s due to the radial engine, using it as a shield. The plane had extremely powerful weapons: four 20mm guns and two machine guns. Knowing that your aircraft could withstand a couple of hits while your burst would blow your opponent to pieces gave a lot of assurance in a frontal assault! Soon, however, the Germans started evading frontal attacks on Cobras, this was obvious. We had a 37mm gun, so no engine would save you, and one hit was enough to kill you. In such a situation you had to have guts for a frontal assault – the engine was of little help. We had stronger guts than the Germans.  I had a case. We engaged four Fokkers head on. We were four against four. During a turn my wingman happened to be in front of me. I ordered him: ‘You go first, I’ll cover you!’ He hit the leading Fokker up front with a cannon round. He hit him with one or maybe two rounds. The Fokker was blown to pieces. The remaining three dispersed and escaped. It all took several seconds."

Top-notch leadership. Four years of battle experience and maneuver warfare. High morale. Near-perfection of combined arms tactics and operational art. Flexibility and cohesion.   Of course, they were reaching the end of their tether when it came to manpower, they served a whole other kind of terror, and they could be incredibly wasteful.

It's just as easy to undervalue von Braun's contribution to rocketeer as it is to overvalue it.  The Saturn is von Braun's baby. His German over-engineering allowed NASA to slap on a 5th F-1 engine without having to increase the structural strength of the Saturn V booster.  Korolev's legacy is still visible in the Vostok and Soyuz systems, so that speaks for itself.  But von Braun actually managed to pull off why he started to build rockets: get to the moon and back in progressively smaller pieces of rocket.

He was essentially an incredible combination of showman and designer, with very little interest in being curtailed by the Americans. Almost like a theme in his work. But he did not create NASA, that was more Seaman and Webb. And Apollo even less so.   These guys like Goddard were amateurs though. Giants at the time, yes. But they had nothing to do with NASA or the modern game. And Korolev had as little to do with the Russian game as Von Braun did with ours...ie, specific implementation of the overall framework he suggested was not his responsibility and it was not done, and had it been done both programs might have been worse.   This is not to say that respect for his achievements is undue, or that literally any American rocket scientist would have been able to fill his shoes.

The group's members were Russian immigrants aged 16 to 21. According to the Daily Telegraph, the men's families were allowed to settle in Israel under the Law of Return, meaning that they all had Jewish ancestry, although did not necessarily practice the religion. However, only one was fully Jewish. Bonite was once recorded telling a gang member ""my grandfather was a half-Jewboy. I will not have children so that this trash will not be born with even a tiny per cent of Jewboy blood.""  The cell was based in Petah Tikva, near Tel Aviv, where they all lived.

Of these 506 cases, in 104 cases there were no casualties associated with the loss of the tank. In 50 cases the casualties were not recorded.

ShitWehraboosSay,38rwxg,burning_phoneix,2,Wed Jun 24 10:33:55 2015 UTC,"Ok I'll bite, I admit that the accuracy thing is quite a bit wacky.    but if you read the original comment, I talk about the inaccuracies in the fight(that 4 Sherman would win against a camouflaged, ambushing tiger)   here's more 'evidence', so to speak for the tiger 1.  Scroll near the bottom and you see this    The Allied response tactic came as mobility. When a Tiger was spotted, and when the terrain line of sight was blocked by hedgerows, Sherman units usually tried to outflank the Tiger. The great chance of the Sherman was its superior mobility and speed, and in return the slow-moving turret of the Tiger. But despite these assets, losses were high. For every Tiger destroyed, an average five or six Sherman would pay the highest price. On a large open-field terrain with at least two miles of visibility, a well-camouflaged Tiger could destroy entire platoons before they came in range.    Is this enough proof that the fight was bullshit?  I admit the Sherman was a good tank and that it was probably one of the best medium tanks in the war, but I'm not sure how it would take so little damage from a tiger's 8.8cm gun at this range"
ShitWehraboosSay,38rwxg,ShortenedLogic,2,Sun Jun 7 17:25:58 2015 UTC,Mainly because Fury's an impressively inaccurate movie and Shermans REALLY would never really try to attack a Tiger at that close without either support or with a numerical advantage.  Let's be honest that scene in real life would end REALLY quickly for the Sherman or the Tiger depending on who saw the other first. The first shot alone would send enough shockwaves to knock out or seriously concuss one or two crew members easily. The problem with the Kill Ratio though is that operationally Kill ratios made honestly very little difference. Yes the Tigers were fantastic in 1v1 situations. But those hardly ever occurred. And efforts were made to avoid situations like that because the Tiger was difficult to fight on a 1v1 situation.   And I have to emphasize that the US armored doctrine (as dictated by the May 1941 FM-100-5 Field Service Manual) specifically emphasized that armored units emphasized both firepower and mobility.
ShitWehraboosSay,38rwxg,buy_a_pork_bun,-2,Sun Jun 7 19:11:51 2015 UTC,"I think those ratio were more towards fights between Shermans and tigers (probably uncommon, tank destroyers would more likely be sent in) Since the real combat ratio for Tigers were 1:10"

Under any stretch of the imagination early space flight and early practical nuclear reactors was driven by Cold War military requirements.  I mean really, imagine someone trying to pitch to a group of venture capitalists that we can make money with satellite communications, but first we have to prove it can work, and we'll likely see who knows how many test runs crash into the ground before we can reliably get stuff in orbit wthout a failure.  It won't happen.  SpaceX is (maybe)viable because there were 40-50 years of American and Soviet rocket research behind it, most of the major hurdles were resolved."
ShitWehraboosSay,38jnik,R_B_Kazenzakis,1 point,Mon Jun 8 02:10:32 2015 UTC,"Im not disputing that lots of research is funded by military need. I do also not disput that if we focus on one thing, say rockets, we will get a relative improvment over what rocket research would have been by otherwise allocating these funds.  However it is false to say that it would never have happend. The value in satalites and nuclar power was recognised early on and eventually it would have been devloped in a normal market envoirment at less cost. Simply put, because of the amount of money spend on the space programm they could literaly blow up tons of rockets, unlike SpaceX, they had the funds for 4 flights.  So my clame would be that a technology that we fundamentally know is possible, ie satilites, rockets, nuclear power would all have devloped eventually when it was more economical to do so. Once the were usful there addoption would have been quite fast. Once there was a market for satalites for example, you would probebly see a lot of investment in that sector, probebly mostly LEO stuff and not trying to land rovers on mars.  Now back to oppertunity cost. All those companys that produced tanks and ships did other things befor the war. They had there own investment and reserach programmes. The governemnt maybe had funds for research on something. Those funds and that creativity was all sucked into the war effort to devlop ways of killing people or avoid killing people. Sometimes this later has civilan use, sometimes it does not.   Its a pretty hard cast to prove that technology was improving faster then it would have. Take for example all those smart germans that had work in one of the most innovate places in the world, but then with the Nazis in power all of that creativy got morphed into creating things that helped the war.  In the end its possible, but hard to prove. Additionally most people just ignore the oppertunity cost."

I guess I should have added the caveat ""within anything like the same time period"".   The value in satalites and nuclar power was recognised early on and eventually it would have been devloped in a normal market envoirment at less cost.   How do you know this?  Did you use your crystal ball?  While we make a lot of big deals about how some Giants of Industry(tm) are risk takers, ""design, test the hell out of(after getting the requisite land and regulation authority permission) and sell a orbital lift vehicle"" is far, far different than rolling out the iPhone for the first time.  Corporations are exceedingly conservative, even risk taking ones.  You need that government to bankroll very risky stuff and accept huge losses in the ""short term""(often measured in years!).

Somehow, I suspect that if the government had throttled back military spending so much that ICBM's weren't being developed(which is ultimately how we got into space), the desires of the American taxpayers aren't going to be ""so spend the cash on pure science that may or may not provide a tangible benefit in my lifetime"".  I referenced Fusion earlier; it's something that the American people just aren't interested in funding even though we know it to possible.  Likewise, it's something that private corporations aren't funding(except to chase scarce government grants).    We all know it's possible, but unless someone(the government) is willing to absorb the positively enormous R&D costs for something that we all know will likely have wildly unexpected problems, it isn't going to get developed in a timely fashion."

He wore the uniform of a captain general (a rank traditionally reserved for the King), resided in the royal Pardo Palace, appropriated the kingly privilege of walking beneath a canopy, and his portrait appeared on most Spanish coins. Indeed, although his formal titles were Jefe del Estado (Head of State) and Generalísimo de los Ejércitos Españoles (Generalissimo of the Spanish Armed Forces), he was referred to as Caudillo de España por la gracia de Dios, (by the Grace of God, the Leader of Spain).

A derisive abbreviation of the term emerged: Wuwa, pronounced ""voo-vah"".   The V-weapons, which were developed earlier and saw considerable deployment (especially against London and Antwerp), trace back to the same pool of highly inventive armament concepts. Therefore, they are also included here.  In Germany, the term Wunderwaffe is still used today to describe a powerful tool.

The Sherman because of its maneuverability and height was good ... [the Panther was] poorly suited for hedgerow terrain because of its width. Long gun barrel and width of tank reduce maneuverability in village and forest fighting. It is very front-heavy and therefore quickly wears out the front final drives, made of low-grade steel.

The B-36 was the largest mass-produced piston engine aircraft ever made. It had the longest wingspan of any combat aircraft ever built at 230 ft (70.1 m). The B-36 was the first bomber capable of delivering any of the nuclear weapons in the U.S. arsenal from inside its four bomb bays without aircraft modifications. With a range of 10,000 mi (16,000 km) and a maximum payload of 72,000 lb (33,000 kg), the B-36 was the world's first manned bomber with an unrefueled intercontinental range. Until it was replaced by the jet powered Boeing B-52 Stratofortress, which first became operational in 1955, the B-36 was the primary nuclear weapons delivery vehicle of the Strategic Air Command (SAC), and the B-36 set the standard for range and payload for subsequent U.S. intercontinental bombers.

At the time it appeared there was a very real chance that Britain might fall to the Nazi ""Blitz"", making a strategic bombing effort by the United States Army Air Corps (USAAC) against Germany impossible with the aircraft of the time.[1] The United States would need a new class of bomber that could reach Europe from bases in North America,[2] necessitating a combat range of at least 5,700 miles (9,200 km), the length of a Gander, Newfoundland–Berlin round trip. The USAAC therefore sought a bomber of truly intercontinental range,[3][4] similar to the Nazi RLM's own ultra-long-range Amerika Bomber program.   They even got bored enough to try a nuclear powered bomber on a B-36."

Heavy SS divisions looked tougher because they had luxuries like their own Tiger battalions and priority on new equipment and were often overstrength, but there were plenty of regular army units like that, such as the Panzer Lehr division (whose elite status was actually well deserved because it was manned by Panzer school instructors and other elite units), and Grossdeutschland, another powerful regular army division. So yeah, at its best the SS was elite, and so was the regular army, but at its worst, it was worse than the most undisciplined Heer unit. Look up the Dirlewanger brigade for a good example."

I got a pretty solid poker face and text rarely causes anything approaching emotive release in me; so believe me when I say this one was tough. The actions engaged by the Kavalrie-Brigade and its later 8.SS incarnation in the Prippet area, its unspeakable. Literal villages wiped off the map because they took some fire from the brush.   What made it worse is that Yerger approached it like a fairly dry academic piece, there's only a few moments of flair in his writing, but when it came through it was evident it was a man simply seething at the material he had to read to understand the depravity and criminality in this unit. If you have any fucking doubt whatsoever that the line between ""Partisan"" and ""Civilian"" was blurred (or more fittingly, merged) by the Germans, you really only need to read this book. The evidence, almost all of it primary German after action reports, is overwhelming.   Way back as well, while I was still in highschool, I had a passionate teacher in the form of a Mr. Hallern. He approached my desk one day and put down, without preamble or context, The Rape of Nanking by a Ms. Iris Chang. He understood me well; what a powerful experience that book was. The absolute idiocy and paranoia that came with anti-partisan and mopping up operations is so clearly evident in Axis actions. Chinese men were bayonetted and killed summarily if they were seen to have callouses on their hands - apparently a sign of the use of a firearm and a soldier. The Japanese either failed to consider, or refused to consider, that these peasants had calloused hands because they were precisely that - hardworking peasants and tradespersons.

Stalin was sweeping all potential competition out of the way and industrializing his country in a span of decades where countries like the US and the British had the luxury of over a century to do so. Mao's ""Great Leap Forward"" wasn't exactly brilliant though.  Japan was an ally of Germany so I fail to see why they're to be held separately.   French and Dutch aren't exactly my wheel house, but colonialism wasn't profitable because it treated the locals with respect. It wanted to extract local resources and bring them home to Europe. Then again I have to imagine the French weren't horribly nice to the Vietnamese. Revolutionary war and what not.  Even the US wasn't operating under an overt expectation to just kill 50-90% of given populations. Most native Americans were killed via disease before the US was even founded. Outside of that you were still dealing with two cultures that held little in common- natives had little concept of property, Americans are incredibly anal about property. At least at some points the US thought they were being beneficial by ""civilizing"" the natives, even if that was laughably abhorrent.   Germany shoved a significant portion of it's population- along with populations they'd effectively just liberated from the Soviets- into camps for the expectation to work people to death."

Ah yes, its completely reasonable to just willfully kill a segment of it's own population because people are starving to death.  You see this justification used so often.   Germany shoved virtually none of its own population into camps   Germany had a Jewish population. Between them and other undesirables there was a significant portion of the population- because willfully committing anyone to labor camps to be treated comparable to slaves is significant- was intentionally moved forward.   they had time to flee beforehand as things got worse and worse,   Except for when they'd be turned away. One of Germany's solutions was dumping the Jewish population on Madagascar for a reason.    lebensraum was straightforward colonialism   Colonialism didn't call for the systematic extermination of 50-95% of specific ethnicites to create ""living space"" for supposedly superior humans. WW2 can be seen as the natural conclusion of colonialism, but lebensraum most certainly cannot. Colonialism was means to an economic end, lebensraum was justification for war.    it's completely untrue to say that North American natives had little concept of property   As they understood it, it was completely different from how early settlers understood it.

A question for Glantz -- if the Soviets were so skilled tactically, how come while producing superior tanks, outproducing the Germans in all armaments by a factor of 3 or 4 to 1 while Germany was fighting on other fronts, why did the German soldier on average inflict roughly five times as many casualties per casualty suffered.

Being taken prisoner by either side wasn't a good experience.   Russians were just as bad if not worse than the Germans were   So German records state that of about 5.7 million Soviet POWs in German captivity, about 3.3 million died by the end of the war. Where as around 350,000 of about 2 million German POWs in Soviet captivity died.   Looking at it on a yearly basis makes it even worse. By the end of 1941, 300,000 Soviet prisoners had died in German captivity, nearly equally the Soviet numbers. The awful treatment of prisoners was toned down a bit because:   1) enough German prisoners had been captured that the Soviets were scarred of reprisals  2) The Germans began to use the prisoners for forced labour  Doesn't mean they were treated all that much better though. In one camp of about 80,000 prisoners, 3,000 had died by February of 1942.   Another example, 10,000 Soviet POWs were sent to work at Auschwitz in October of 1941. By Spring of 1942, a few hundred were left.   Did the Soviets treat POWs nicely? No. But I'm not seeing how they could be considered ""the same or worse.""   specially considering the Hunger Plan ""happened"" (this depends on the opinion but let's go with yours.)   I love how the Hunger Plan is in scare quotes as its a hotly debated topic.   Yes Hitler was planning to attack Russia since they were a great threat to Germany and Western Europe as a whole, Also i'm pretty sure Stalin planned to invade Western Europe[3] .   There was a plan developed by Zhukov as a spoiling attack against Germany, the plan is still archived and won't be release until 2017 (?) and so until that happens we won't know just how extensive the plan was. But all evidence points to there not being a grand Soviet plan to invade all of Europe in the immediate future. Even if there was, given the state of German intelligence, I doubt Hitler knew of it."

If you want to consider what they were the best at, you'd probably have to consider all those steel reinforced concrete structures they built that are just a nuisance today. I can't think of anyone who built structures so prodigiously that serve no purpose but would require diamond tipped saws (or something similar since explosives don't work) to remove, so are just left standing, or buried.  They were also masters of dead-end technologies. There was no logical way to build on concepts such as fly-by-wire missiles, or, say, the V2 rocket. Hell, the V2 was more effective at killing slave labor and German personnel than it was at killing it's intended targets.  Prior to the Nazis, Germany was one of the major scientific hubs of Europe. I think that's where folks are going to get a bit lost- Germany had a scientific community. The Nazis spooked most of them away for just the strangest reasons.

Generally it was decided that the Soviet/US method of focusing production on one type of really flexible design was better than the German method of cranking out a vehicle for every specialized need.  All the better if that flexible vehicle had enough mobility to get places quickly, armour to defeat most AT-weapons and weapons to hurt any other comparable tank.  Heavy tanks tended to be expensive, slow, and unreliable.  They had great value in breaking through fixed lines but very little ability to exploit the breakthrough afterwards."

ShitWehraboosSay,383vyg,EvanHarper,4,Wed Jun 3 15:04:17 2015 UTC,"The issue I see with the German heavies is, I think, rather emblematic of the failings of the German general staff.  The Tiger was indeed a formidable tank on the tactical level. It was well armored, had a very good gun, it was fairly reliable (the Tiger 1, that is, the King Tiger was a POS) and it was remarkably fast for a heavy.  However, it had one huge Achilles heel that could be exploited by an astute commander.   It had a max operational range range of 70 miles off road.   This is a big problem because the entire point of a heavy tank is to serve as a breakthrough weapon. It uses it's big gun and heavy armor to muscle through enemy lines, at which point follow on forces can go through and begin to exploit the breakthrough to operational depth.   Given the Tiger's pathetic operational range and the sorry state of German logistics making field refueling a difficult affair, it wasn't able to be the breakthrough weapon it needed to be. The Soviet defense in depth at Kursk was nearly 200 miles deep, so all the Red Army needed to do was rope a dope the Tigers until they ran out of fuel, at which point they were little more than very expensive pillboxes.  So despite it's vaunted KDR that wehraboos crow about, the Tiger couldn't win battles.   One of the greatest weaknesses of the German general staff in the war was a crushing over focus on the tactical level of combat to the detriment of operational and strategic work. The Soviets were the opposite. The tactical level was not seen as terribly important if operational and strategic planning were sound. The Americans, under Eisenhower, were more or less the same (although NATO would bizarrely abandon this after the war and become wunderwaffen obsessed, for some reason) and given that the Germans were utterly defeated in the war, I think we can say that the Soviet/American ideas on warfare were the superior ones."
ShitWehraboosSay,383vyg,pronhaul2012,3,Mon Jun 1 21:46:00 2015 UTC,"Does anyone have actual production cost figures at hand for each? That'd probably be a good place to start.  Of course, we'd need to also factor in ""lifetime costs"" (Maintenance, repairs, fuel expenditure)."
ShitWehraboosSay,383vyg,socialjusticeorc,4,Mon Jun 1 18:28:39 2015 UTC,"In terms of monetary costs for production alone (although figures vary) it seems that Tigers ranged from being 2-4x more expensive than a Panther. StuG IIIs and Panzer IVs being around 75-80k Reichmarks.  I wouldn't say that increasing the production of the Panzer IV would've necessarily helped given that the Panther's design was made to address issues like the Rubber shortage and as a platform was a very decent tank. By 1942-43 the Pz IV platform was beginning to show it's age too. The Engines were rather weak and the Pz IV's armor format was...well not entirely optimal. It didn't help that as a tank, the Panzer IV's gun was slowly becoming sub optimal.  Hypothetically, the Panzer IV in increased numbers may have helped, but the Panther was a good compromise (purportedly given that the cost doesn't include maintenance costs.) because it was only slightly more expensive (on paper) than the Panzer IV. As far as I know, the Panther could have worked if not for it's design being rather difficult to maintain.  So what's my conclusion? Honestly, it's hard to say. The Panzer IV was still in production in 1945, it was still cheap and easy to make. The problem was that it was outdated by 1942. Crew quality was problematic in the late war, but Germany was experiencing man power shortages for a while, notably in the Luftwaffe where quite a few new trainees ended up dying or injuring themselves flying war planes with insufficient training.  The other problem is scale, the Panther and the Tiger in isolation is a good tank. In fact with a logistics program that could support them (and perhaps a couple of design revisions that ameliorated the unreliability of the first run) the replacements for the Panzer IV and Germany's heavy tank could be massively effective. But this still ignores the practical usage of the Tiger, which had woefully short range, or the difficulties of getting the Panthers to actually work in the field."
ShitWehraboosSay,383vyg,buy_a_pork_bun,3,Mon Jun 1 20:47:40 2015 UTC,"However, if I recall correctly, wasn't the bottleneck later during the war actually tank crew quality rather than tank numbers? If I'm not mistaken (I admit I might be since I'm not sure) just based on some anecdotes (e.g. Carius commanding Jagdtigers) there was a shortage of quality tank crews, and new ones had insufficient training and panicked easily under fire.   Well even if Germany couldn't crew them, Finland, Hungary, Slovakia, Romania and Italy would buy them to replace their tanks based on prewar Czechoslovakian designs. The best tank they made was arguably the 40M Turán.  It relies on the assumption that Panthers and Tigers were designed for their crews to survive. They weren't while a wet Sherman brewed up 10-15% of the time, the Tiger brewed up 80% of the time since the ammo filled the sides of the hull sponsons. For an anecdote the Pool went through 3 tanks without any of his crew dying while Wittmann and his entire crew perished with the loss of their Tiger.  Panther wasn't inherently better than the Panzer IV. They tried to cancel Panzer IV production fairly early on in the Panther's life but Guderian put a stop that as it ""would have certainly lead to the defeat of the German Army in the near future"".  Gen. Fritz Bayerlein Assessment of the Panther wasn't full of praise. (from: Armored Thunderbolt by Steven Zaloga)   While the PzKpfw IV could still be used to advantage, the PzKpfwV [Panther] proved ill adapted to the terrain. The Sherman because of its maneuverability and height was good ... [the Panther was] poorly suited for hedgerow terrain because of its width. Long gun barrel and width of tank reduce maneuverability in village and forest fighting. It is very front-heavy and therefore quickly wears out the front final drives, made of low-grade steel. High silhouette. Very sensitive powertrain requiring well-trained drivers. Weak side armor; tank top vulnerable to fighterbombers. Fuel-lines of porous material that allow gasoline fumes to escape into the tank interior causing a grave fire hazard. Absence of vision slits makes defense against close attack impossible.   Otto Carius lambasted not only the crews but the Jagdtiger itself. (from: Tigers in the Mud)   When  the  assault  guns  were  calibrated  in  Sennelager,  we  experienced  our  first failure.  Despite  its eighty-two tons,  our ""Hunting  Tiger"" didn't  want  to  act  like we  wanted  it  to.  Only  its  armor  was satisfactory; its maneuverability left a  lot  to  be  desired.  In  addition,  it  was  an  assault  gun. There  was  no  traversing  turret,  just  an  enclosed,  armored  housing.  Any large traversing  of  the  cannon  had  to  be  effected  by  movement  of  the entire  vehicle. Because  of  that,  transmissions  and  steering  differentials were  soon  out  of  order.  That  such  a monstrosity  had  to  be  constructed  in the  final  phase  of  the  war-of  all times! A  better  idea  for  the  travel lock of  the  eight meter long  cannon  of  our  "" Hunting  Tiger "" was also absolutely necessary.  It  had  to  be  removed  from  the  outside  during  contact with  the  enemy! Locking  down  the  barrel  during  a  road  march  was necessary,  of course.  Otherwise  the  mounting  brackets  would  have  been  worn  out  too quickly  and  exact  aiming  would  have  been  impossible.   Still the Germans started looking for a replacement to the Panzer III and IV since 1938 however this replacement wasn't the Panther. It was the 20 to 24 ton VK 20 series. Those got canned because the politicians went omigosh T-34/KV-1 too stronk and demanded a heavier tank."

Additionally, it was in 1944: when Hitler's erratic behaviour (more importantly, the British impression thereof) was at its height. In the end though, if they did abandon it for such reasons it was probably because they figured Hitler had done his damage, and that martyring him would just galvanise German morale - but now I'm conjecturing just as badly so I'll stop."

Then Barbarossa happened and the Soviets basically had to fall back on the Mosins.  Small example, but one I think is emblematic of what was going on.   Sure, but none of that has to do with invading Poland and annexing Baltic states, and then killing/deporting thousands of people there, as being necessary as part of ""the plan.""  The guys I'm talking about (Russian nationalists mainly, and then 14 year old middle class poser Marxists) actually defend those actions as necessary to prepare for war.  They defend the deportation of the Crimean Tatars too, and just about everything else that Stalin did because it was all supposedly for the greater good of the world, and it's offensive to me.  Tankies are as full of shit as most Wehraboos."

It allowed the Soviets to push their lines up much farther than they would have been able to otherwise, which at least in theory should have given them a lot more time before any invading army could reach the Soviet Union.  In practice it didn't work so well, but I think that was the idea. The deportations and killings are indefensible, but my general impression of Stalin is that he was motivated more by a ruthless, sociopathic pragmatism more than malice. He killed people because they were in his way and it was quicker and easier than playing nice."

ShitWehraboosSay,37ytz6,pier4r,20,Sun May 31 15:42:07 2015 UTC,"Here are some things that come to mind in terms of equipment/vehicles (this is by no means comprehensive):   Bf 109 - a fantastic design, that, with routine (and often significant) upgrades, remained relevant all the way from the Spanish Civil War to the end of WWII. There's a reason why it is the most produced fighter aircraft in history. Ju 88 - a very versatile aircraft, used in a variety of roles. Rarely gets attention, but it was a good plane. Panzerfaust - cheap, easy to build in large quantities, and very effective. It did get a bit of a poor reputation, due to the fact that late-war conscripts were often given just a panzerfaust, which obviously is inadequate at fighting anything that isn't a vehicle, but for what the weapon was designed to do, it was quite brilliant. MG 34/42 - the MG 34, and it's close descendent, the MG 42, were the best light machine guns of the war, period. Each German squad had a machine gunner with an MG 34 of 42, and that helps explain why German infantry was so effective on a tactical level. The other combatants of the war went with magazine-fed guns for their squad automatic weapons - the Bren, Degtyaryov, and BAR come to mind - which just weren't as good. Comparing the MG 42 to the BAR is like comparing night and day. When you consider that the light machine gun is one of the most basic and common weapons, Germany's edge in this regard (which they retained throughout the war) helps explain why German infantry did so well on various occasions. Panzer IV - easy to upgrade, remained tactically competitive with more advanced tanks (the Sherman and famous T-34 come to mind) throughout the war. Along with the Panzer III, it also had the very useful 3-person turret. Anyone who tries to tell you that French tanks were actually better than German ones can be pretty easily ignored on that virtue alone - those poor French tankers often had to deal with one-man turrets. Crew layout is very important, though it's not something that people usually focus on (most people just prefer to talk about armour thickness and gun calibre and whatnot). StuG III/IV - like the Panzer IV, the StuG remained a reliable and potent weapon throughout the war.   In terms of tactics:   Armoured tactics: the Germans were better at this than anyone else at the start of the war, period. Better trained, better doctrine, and more radios to help carry their operations out. There is a reason why German tank crews managed to achieve very favourable kill-ratios to T-34s in 41/42, despite the fact that the T-34 as in many ways a much better tank than what the Germans had at that time. Submarine wolf-packs: there's a reason why the USN used similar tactics against the Japanese. It worked. Finger-four: this was the formation used by Luftwaffe fighters. A formation of four fighters, with a flight leader and his wingman, and a secondary leader and his wingman. The Luftwaffe wasn't the only air force to use this formation, but the British were still using the three-plane ""vic"" formation at the start of the war, and the finger-four was simply much more effective.   /u/ShitWehraboosSay is a self-admitted circlejerk thread. It's not /r/askhistorians or something. The Wehrmacht was badly outmatched by the Allies during WWII, but the obviously were doing some things right, considering that they were indeed able to take a large chunk of Europe and inflict high losses on the Allies as they attempted to take it back."
ShitWehraboosSay,37ytz6,eighthgear,11,Sun May 31 20:54:01 2015 UTC,"The thing about the Wehrmacht was that in the context of their time, they were rather good. The problem came when they had to consolidate their acquisitions and when the opposition began to adapt to their tactics, strategy and equipment. I mean the radio communication and close air support were fantastic. The only issue was that once doctrine began shifting towards large scale operations the Germans had to catch up.  In other words, I don't think people here would say the Wehrmacht were utterly incompetent or without merit. But the culthood status of the Wehrmacht loses its shine when everyone else started adapting."
ShitWehraboosSay,37ytz6,buy_a_pork_bun,9,Sun May 31 23:45:01 2015 UTC,"Certainly. And there were some areas in which the Germans really were behind. They never put in service a true heavy bomber, for example. Their artillery coordination was inferior to that of the British and especially the Americans. Despite having the ""mighty"" Bismarck, the German surface fleet was entirely outmatched by the Royal Navy (on a related note, the Kriegsmarine had to make do with some of the worst destroyers of any of the main combatants in the war). Their logistics were often poor (relying heavily on horses), and German industry was completely inefficient before Speer took charge in 42."

However, also stopped producing other things and then showed statistics how one product exploded in production, but then don't show that other products are not being produced anymore.  Speer allowed and pushed for extraordinary harsh slave labour factories, where the works would live in caves and sleep right were they work. Its very brutal but effective in brining out pure numbers of the same item.  The best book on this is ""Wages of Destruction"".

ShitWehraboosSay,37ytz6,jeteaway,4,Mon Jun 1 17:56:34 2015 UTC,"There was a whole bunch of problems with the German destroyers - They had poor hull designs, which were compounded by poor welding. This led to a tendency to lose sterns after taking damage, and poor resistance to underwater explosions. Their machinery was too complex for easy maintenance, which wasn't helped by their very cramped machinery spaces. The machinery also suffered from mechanical problems, mainly steam leaks. They were overcrowded ships, with a wartime complement of 364 for the 'Narviks' (over double what the Royal Navy thought would comfortably fit on a ship of similar size). They were heavily armed, with 5.9 inch guns. However, this had major disadvantages; 5.9 inch shells are difficult to handle and load by hand, and so the guns had a much lower rate of fire than their Allied or Japanese equivalents. The increased topweight had a major impact on seakeeping and stability, making them terrible gun platforms, and decreasing their ability to operate in bad weather."

Obviously the German fighter program had major problems with it's design cycle, just like everything else designed by German. The fighters that were seen in large number during the war were good. The FW-190 was easily the most capable fighter when it was released in 1940, and continued improvement and later adaption for high-altitude (the famous Dora variants) remained relevant until the end of the war. The characteristics of the 190 also fit very well with contemporaneous air-combat theory at the time (particularly from German thinkers), it was fast and prioritized rate-of-climb and roll performance over turning. With the intuitive, which German doctrine basically assumed, a skilled pilot could use these features to incredible advantage.   The main issue with German fighters was that none of them were well suited to combat the strategic bombing campaign. That and the fact that German had a chronic shortage of skilled pilots."

It wasn't conducive to a lightly armored, mobile AT vehicle to have to close to about 300-100 meters to actually fight the enemy's most common tank.   Germans were quite adept at pouring concrete over steel to build bunkers, towers, and other objects that were almost impossible to get rid of.   Someone else can step in and correct me but the Kar98k seems to have been virtually identical to comparable weapons in performance.  The Kubelwagon was one of the better light vehicles the Germans built, along with the BMW R75 motorcycle. At the very least the Americans thought so highly of the R75 that they had Harley Davidson virtually clone the thing.  German jet engines weren't necessarily the first, but at the bare minimum the Soviets thought so highly of them that most of their first era of mass produced jet engine aircraft were based off German engine designs.

The M1 only went into production in 1936, and production took years to ramp up; despite that, about eight times as many M1s were produced as STG44s and G43s combined.

German radio navigation technology was superior to anything the British possessed in the early war period.  The StugIII and Panzer IV were superb weapon systems in the context of armoured warfare, as indeed, were the Bf109 and the Fw190 in the context of air superiority fighters. Certain aspects of German night fighting such as Schragemusik and the Flensburg 227 were outstanding in their conception and execution.   However, this is pissing in the ocean.

Formidable weapons on paper, but difficulties with reliability, maintenance, production, and cost of production, renders them shit.    Yes, in some hypothetical World of Tanks 1-v-1 universe, the Tiger I is a really good weapons system. In the real world, where ease and costs of maintenance and production actually count, the Tiger I is an expensive, rare, and unreliable waste of resources, well beyond the industrial capacity of it's progenitor nation to produce and well beyond the capacity of its armed forces to maintain in the field, that should have been spent more effectively on producing StugIII's and PzIV's.  Now if Hitler had some infinite resources cheat code that he could type into the console by pressing ~, then yes, the Tiger I would have been a good thing.

The Tiger was not simply unreliable because it was untested, it was congenitally unreliable, and as a design was a total failure, which is why they only built about 1,400 of them.   To be clear, the problem with the Tiger is not reliability, the problems with the Tiger are inherent to its design.

It's worth noting that there's a (possibly apocryphal) story repeated that the reason why the US stuck with the Sherman for so long was because it's footprint in the Mass-produced Victory/liberty ships was substantially less than the M26 Pershing.  In other words, there was a lot of coordination and communication going across all aspects of the Western Allies war effort.  Even if the US could have produced as many Pershings as Shermans, fewer would have arrived in Europe, hence the ""good enough"" Sherman made more sense.  Fun fact, at least one Russian tanker who drove both T-34s and Shermans thought that both had good things about them but that the British tank he drove was absolute shit.  He felt that the fit and finish of the Sherman was great, and it was much quieter than Russian and German tanks."

The IS had double the range, and the old KV series had about 50 miles on the IS.  Not only does that seriously restrict your operational flexibility (and virtually defeat the entire purpose of a heavy tank in the first place), but it makes no sense for an army which was staring down serious fuel shortages to be fielding such a gas guzzler.

With it reincarnated as the MG3, it's one of the few things that didn't quickly disappear as a dead end after victory in Europe. I haven't read enough about small arms to judge it in relation to its allied counterparts though.  Panzer IV and Stug III's 7.5 cm KwK/StuK 37 L/24 was a far more sensible choice for infantry support than the Matilda II's 2 pdr although the dual purpose 75 mm M3/76.2 mm F-34 was the ideal.  75 mm PaK 40 although heavier than the 76.2 mm ZiS-3, it was still lighter than the 3"" gun M5 and weighed half as much as the 17 pdr. In the AT role the 8.8 cm Flak 36 was overall inferior. The 8.8 cm was ridiculously heavy at 5 times the weight of the PaK 40, had a far larger silhouette and yet its penetration was only slightly better.  ""It took 5 flimsies to take on 1 jerrycan"". Made up statistics aside, jerrycans were definitely more durable than the flimsies. The design was copied and became widespread for a reason."

My main criticism of American replenishment is that it was a trickle-in; new men arrived in drips without a familiar face in sight and were often killed or wounded before they could learn valuable lessons. Germans coalesced their newcomers into training battalions within a division and at higher formations, replacements arrived in batches and often served in the same Kompanie or Zug - even if their training was shit-tier, and it very much was late war, its a huge boost to morale and pyschological calm in combat to be fighting with men who are more than indifferent to your existence. There's also the argument in the early war when the training was far more thorough, that men who arrived and trained in batches already knew the ins and outs of operating with a squad; coupled with the 'familiar faces' theory and you have a potent training organization."

About 'not only the numbers' because even if you are able to outproduce someone else, your product should be used properly in the war.

Germany didn't militarize its industry for war production until 1943, meaning that their tank production didn't peak until after the war was already completely lost.  They also didn't mobilize the women of their population to work in factories, so they actually had more soldiers in the military than they had civilians at home supporting the soldiers with war production.  For the allies, it was the exact opposite.  German production methods were also outdated and very slow.  They lacked the highly efficient assembly lines and modern factories of the USSR and especially the USA.  Furthermore, they lacked sufficient access to many kinds of essential raw materials.  And the final nail in the coffin is that even if they did, it wouldn't matter.  In the 1940s the US was far and away the most heavily industrialized country in the world, with a warmaking potential that was greater than the entire Axis combined.  This is why scenarios of rushed Me 262 swarms of jet fighters that entered the war earlier and similar things to that inevitably fall flat when you take a look at the reality of production.  All that would likely happen is that the war would be extended slightly longer while the US proceeds to copy the Me 262 or rush its own design, and produce them at 10x the rate that the Germans could."

Where it gets complicated is in figuring out how many people, especially civilians, were alive at any given point; it's generally agreed that about 20-25 million Soviet citizens, including 8-10 million in the military, were killed over the course of the war.   It's worth noting as well that Soviet industry was less broad in the types of war materiel that it needed to produce than either the US or the UK. It had no need to build a massive navy or strategic air force, and it benefited from very large Lend-Lease shipments of shoes, food, trucks, locomotives, and, to a lesser extent, aircraft. Thus they were more able to concentrate their (relatively) smaller work force on the production of tanks, artillery, small arms, tactical aircraft, and the like."

The rule of thumb is that the Germans would make the part right there along the assembly line as the vehicle arrived down the line, the British would take a pre-fabricated part and work it to fit, the USSR and USA would throw a part that doesn't fit away and get a new part.  Despite their attempts to adopt ""Fordism""(what they called American-style management and mass production) they largely failed miserably.  When they heard that the US was mass production victory and liberty ships in chunks with final assembly at shipyards, they decided to try the same with U-boats.  Problem was the parts didn't fit when they arrived!  Tramp freighters had a lot more tolerances built into them and could deal with that sort of screw up.

I've worn battledress quite a bit, and WW1 service dress, which is similar to the wehrmacht uniform, being a reenactor, and I've got to say, battledress may not be the best looking uniform (although when tailored it can look quite nice), it's pretty obvious why that route was chosen. Aside from saving a lot of wool, the lower pockets on a service dress uniform are almost useless when wearing webbing, as often it covers to lower pockets making them difficult to reach. And also if you have anything large in the lower pockets, it feels just awkward and kind of annoying.  Sorry for going a little off topic."

WARTIME DEVELOPMENTS. The prolongation of the war into 1942 resulted in a need for simplification of the field uniform, and in the use of a poorer quality cloth. By the winter of 1943-44, the average wool content of the field uniform cloth had sunk to approximately 50 per cent, with some uniforms dropping as low as 40 per cent. The wool itself was of low quality because it had been re-worked. These recent field uniforms present a shoddy appearance even when new; they also have very poor thermal insulation, and when wet lack strength. The press of economic conditions resulted in the introduction on 25 September 1944 of an entirely new field uniform--the Model 1944. This uniform will replace that designed in 1936 as stocks of the latter are exhausted. The new field uniform is designed to conserve resources and to permit production by relatively unskilled labor."

The problem is that when brought up, it completely ignores that a lot of the pioneering work for rocketry was done by an American named Robert H. Goddard, or ignoring that Frank Whittle invented the turbojet engine and that the Gloster Meteor was mere months behind the Me 262, and then followed itself very shortly by the P-80 Shooting Star.

For the point of ""who did first what"", my question was not quarreling of who did first what. I mean, you can have a concept and then someone else could develop it better or faster or whatever is needed to use it operationally in war.  So, the gloster meteor was operational, but never saw combat 'active' to avoid giving to enemy hands. I remember only the 'anti v1' role of the Meteor. But again we are talking about a scope that cannot be compared. The Meteor was not used as the p51 or as the me262 so we cannot compare me262 and Meteor with enough data.  As far as i know the me262 was one of the few airplanes based on jet propulsion fighting against other airplanes in the ww2. The other jet airplanes with the same conditions were only Germans, i mean fighting other airplanes. Sure was full of flaws due to several reasons (one could be: based on a technology that was still in the developing stages - jet engines), but still this has no parallel in the soviet/allies alliance also because the war ended.  For what i read here and elsewhere, a lot of users compare stuff that had different usage. Like comparing apples and potatoes just because 'are product of agriculture' that seems a bit forced."

That's why the Hurricane won the BoB, the Spitfire is iconic, and the Gloster Meteor is a foot note.  Technology is part of the equation, but logistics, tactics, production, doctrine are more important.

And there are evidences (even by historians who take a critical stand towards him like Claudia Hecht) that he most likely found out about the atrocities in the East in late 1943, early 1944, after digging out Jewish corpses from a lake as well as having members of the Resistance contact and report to him with concrete evidences. So at most until that period he only listened about bad things from third hand sources, most likely gossips and foreign press which he would've dismissed as enemy propaganda. According to Fraser, in Africa he did hear about atrocities but he stubbornly argued that an idealist like Hitler would never do it.   Rommel, the General who never fought on the Eastern Front, found time to dig out Jewish Corpses from a lake and reciprocate contact with Partisan Groups in the East. ActuaLol. I'll take 5 of whatever the flying fuck he's smoking, waiter. Hitler was an idealist alright, in his ideal world there would be no Jews, very few Slavs, and everyone would get the fuck off Germany's front lawn, which just so happened to be in the Ukraine.  I could probably cut the thread there, but wait, there's more!    practically all historians left and right agree that he at least took it to the extent sending an ultimatum to Hitler telling him to make peace with the West and would've done it on his own if Hitler continued to refuse   I find it just a little bit eyebrow raising that the 'boo goes out of his way to assert the politics of all the mass of uncited 'historians' he quotes or paraphrases in every single point. We understand, Historians can be politicized, do you need to bring this up in every post? Of course he does, because he feels it somehow adds legitimacy to his argument - its just those dastardly libturd historians smearing muh Honorable Rommel's name!  He informed Hitler that should the Atlantic Wall fail, he would have to make peace. This is far from issuing an ultimatum, this is a Commander telling his head of state ""If I fail to do this, we lose the war."" There's a reason why Rommel's defense of the Atlantic Wall is dubbed 'the longest day' theory. Rommel was convinced the war in the West would be make or break on the initial day of Allied invasion. The shitposter goes on to argue about Rommel's link to the July 20th plot, which was a far less shitposty thing to do, he should've went straight to that if he wanted to make his point. Anyways, moving on:   Regarding Model, the man destroyed his documents and didn't live to write memoirs so it's hard to truly know him.    Yes, he died a fanatic fighting a lost cause in the Ruhr pocket. He bit the big ol' happy pill and proclaimed his final loyalty to Hitler just before death.  I'd say his final actions are quite telling in and of themselves; the man was willing to die for a Regime; and lets face it, half of the suicides in the twilight hours of the Reich were men who knew they'd face the gallows post-war. Model was an unabashed Nazi, defending him as anything but is grounds for immediate 'Wehraboo' tagging.   Regarding the revolt thing, I myself don't have a high opinion on Manstein's morality (nor do I consider him the biggest bastard who has ever been born), but I must say many people today are so one sided when it comes to complex problems. This is historian Robert Forczyk's opinion (and he is the last person who will ever defend Manstein's morality; he's more of a Walter Model's admirer)   Sigh. Shout out to /u/phoenixbasileus for attempting to slay the shitpost dragon."
ShitWehraboosSay,37ycp4,treebeard87,-5,Sun May 31 13:05:25 2015 UTC,"Why should I not underline the political aspect regarding one of the most politicized people of all time? Along the same lines of the Spiegel article (written by, mind you, someone who changed his opinion from [negative](www.spiegel.de/international/germany/world-war-ii-new-research-taints-image-of-desert-fox-rommel-a-484510.html) to fairly positive in the span of 5 years): First in wartime, he was everybody's favorite guy and the Fuhrer's best bud (and at the same time he had a large fanclub on the Allied side too. Auchinleck had to sign an order forbidding the treatment of Rommel as God. And his soldiers recalled always being asked about Rommel whether at home or as POWs). Then the war ended, everybody else got discredited including the very charismatic Fuhrer, but Rommel was still the Hero and now a Resistance Fighter. They swallowed that because they loved him and the young Republic desperately needed a Father Figure, who could unify them and justify the Rearmament (but the new and old propagandists were careful stressing that he didn't join the assassination, because even Hitler loyalists needed to be catered to). Decades later, old generations died, and war crimes accusations came. Again, suddenly, declassified tapes were released showing him trying to  assassinate Hitler; full doc. So his image has always been something various governments and political forces decide that it should be for the benefit of the stupid mass. The German people are tired of it, and yet they still care. Cornelia Hecht says that ""Rommel sells"".  I like him and even I am tired of people who say good and bad things about him only because of political agendas, so I take it on myself to inform people that this must be something of importance. (This is nothing new btw. I also like Garibaldi, the spiritual Father of Italy. And depending on the time, he has been a loyal monarchist, a true republican, ""true father of fascism"", socialist etc etc)  He didn't just fight in the desert. He had a brief time in Italy and he found the corpses there.   ""It remains unclear whether Rommel... the corpses of murdered Jews he found in a lake in northern Italy in 1943"" source  Rommel having contacts with the Resistance at least since coming to Normandie is something no historian argues against today. See the doc above for the historians who are interviewed. Also see Beevor HansenBrighton In Rommel's mind, leaders who put themselves in the same danger they put their men into = idealists. He was naive but that was it. It was mostly because of this incident He did send an ultimatum, giving Hitler the last chance to end the thing on his own. See Beckett, Brighton;Marshall; Mitcham... and anybody for the f sake.    Regarding Model, do you mistake him with somebody else? He shot himself without saying anything of the sorts.   And lastly, I've already said multiple times that Model was not clean. I'm only curious because of some of his characteristics I see as interesting. What have you or that phoenix guy said that addressed my point that Manstein might have been a guy of low moral character, but it doesn't change the fact that Forzyk has his point saying that:     ""The author also spends a great deal of effort condemning von Manstein for not joining the anti-Hitler conspiracy and cites his defects of character for not committing treason. I'm sick of modern writers who make it seem that joining a conspiracy against one of the most vicious dictators in history was a simple decision and that any German who didn't join it was a coward or blind moron. Although the assassination of Hitler would have benefited Allied interests, it is not clear that it would have been better for Germany (a German collapse in mid-1944 could have led to Soviet occupation of more of central Europe). For better of worse, Germany picked Hitler to lead them in 1933 and once the Nazis were in charge, it is doubtful that anything a handful of rebellious generals did could reverse that fate. All these post-war `what ifs?' about the conspirators are fantasies and not worthy of place in even a pseudo-biographical work such as this."""

One of the messengers of death said that before he swallowed the poison capsule, he said ""I once loved the Führer and I still love him”. A SS guy also said that he saw the man crying when he died. Finally the wife and others mentioned the expression of absolute contempt on his dead face. The Rommel-Hitler story was quite the drama. Rommel was obsessed with chivalry. Nobody understood nor encouraged that, even the wife. Then came Hitler, who was also obsessed with chivalry (Yes yes. Google Hitler and his obsession with the opera Lohengrin for that matter). The Fuhrer threw himself in danger so Rommel could save him like a knight saving a damsel in distress (Yes yes that happened)  <<I am the one who persuaded Hitler to drive right on to Hradschin Castle under my personal protection. I told him: “My Fuhrer, you had no real choice but to take right into the heart of the land, their very capital."" I almost forced him to come with me. He put himself in my hands, and he never forgot me for giving him that excellent advice.>> (after driving in an open top car into the newly conquered Prague, just the two of them together. Himmler and co were terrified seeing them do it.)  <<It's like he likes the fires… I have to try so hard to protect him>>  He owed Hitler everything. Hitler gave him the tanks knowing him knowing nothing about tanks. Hitler let him have an independent command which allowed him to live his dream in the desert. Hitler gave him an object of dedication so that the Knight could live to his true nature. Read Maurice Remy and others. Irving was not the most objective but I see his point saying that Rommel was devoted to Hitler the same way he was devoted to his wife (except the sexual dimension of course, not that I'm sure about this). After seeing Hitler's crimes, he was disgusted and he decided to do the things he should do for Germany. But the feelings lingered to the very end.   It was a love that was reciprocated. In the end when everything fell apart and Hitler himself felt broken, he tried to lean a final time on the personification of indomitable German spirit, who he himself had killed - he was trying to build a huge monument for Rommel! With the help of Bormann who was one of the main culprits in the murder. While Himmler tried to explain that he and Hitler were innocent in Rommel's death to everybody. Such was the terrible scale of the man's charisma. They killed millions of people, but only Rommel mattered.    ""The message was, that he, Himmler, knew the whole story,  that he was horrified and that he would never have had a  hand in such a thing. Berndt was now serving with the S.S.  He had gone back to the Propaganda Ministry and been  thrown out by Goebbels for repeating Rommel's remark that  the war was lost. To Himmler's message he added a gloss  of his own. Hitler, he declared, was equally innocent. It  was the work of Keitel and Jodl. Later he wrote a strange,  ecstatic letter from the front before he, too, was killed.  There had, he said, been some "" higher purpose "" in Rommel's death but Hitler was not guilty of it.""  Source  (While in his memoirs, Heinz Linge, Hitler's valet, told a story that it was all Bormann's job and Hitler knew nothing, that Hitler didn't believe Bormann's stories and ordered an autopsy on the corpse. I wonder where he got this info from?)  See, love doesn't mean respect nor loyalty nor not killing each other.  It was a different type of love. But Napoleon once said something similar about Josephine.  So the lesson of the story is? Having a savior complex allows people to use and abuse you in all the ways you cannot even imagine.

At first I felt disturbed but I like the game now. Most of them seem to be a bit like ""Yes we know he loved Hitler, but so what?""  Those people were strange creatures. Faced with one of those ""strange, may be exaggerated"" order of Hitler, Rommel cried out ""nicht Ritterliches vorgehen!"" (It was not the chivalrous way at all!). It was not about something criminal, or evil, it was about something not chivalrous. And then he burned it (he could've been tried for high treason doing so) and apparently forgot it. Because later when FM Kluge (his superior) reproached him for not obeying orders, he blew up and demanded when and where he had done that, forcing Kluge to apologize with words and texts.

I don't take any pride in my knowledge (or lack of knowledge) regarding WWII, but in short, it is my understanding that the summer of 1940 was not a good season for the Brits. The Battle of Britain was a win for Britain, but at a cost. The apparently blasphemous phrase OP originally quoted, ""The Nazis were in phenomenal shape and actually could have really devastated or even captured Britain if they hadn't decided to take a little bit of a break,"" was inspired by the knowledge that an Axis victory in the Battle could have resulted in an armistice, which is what Hitler wanted.

The allies were generally on a back-footing until 1941-42, then the strategic realities started asserting themselves.  The problem with a British armistice is that the Germans had no realistic way of landing in England and without that, the English are staying in the war.  The break between the end of the battle of France and the beginning of the battle of Britain is about two weeks but bear in mind, the Germans had lost some 1200 aircraft in France (about a quarter of the German airforce). They needed a break as much as the British did.  The ultimate problem for ""German victory"" is that German troops need to actually get past the Royal Navy and remain supplied while carrying out operations in England and there's no realistic way for them to do that.

Saying the Blitzkrieg was devastating to British Forces is an overstatement of the efficacy of a Nazi Germany that over extended in three different theaters. And in my opinion too kind of praise for a doctrine that only yielded results on the initial thrust or in desperate counteroffensives.
ShitWehraboosSay,37xojv,Hatewrecked,-2,Sun May 31 09:41:04 2015 UTC,"In what way, though? I'm not a history buff, but from what I understand, the British walked their way back across the Channel on crutches after losing France and then lost 40,000 civilian lives in a painful victory. Maybe the British would have ultimately emerged victorious 100 times out of 100, but I don't understand how any strategy which causes you to lose countless battles only to retreat home is not a devastation. No, the Blitzkrieg was not the godsend military plan, and I never said it was. But I don't understand the denial of its effectiveness when it comes to the impact it had on British occupation in Western Europe."
ShitWehraboosSay,37xojv,buy_a_pork_bun,8,Sun May 31 10:05:36 2015 UTC,"That's the thing. The British were doing rather poorly in 1940. By the end of it, the British defensive managed to damage the Germany. Offensive enough that resources necessary to commit to the African or Eastern Front were wasted on an attempt to bomb out a city that was heavily defensive.  The fact that the Battle Of Britain was fought shows the shortsightedness of the Wehrmacht. Their successes in 1939 and 1940 are not to be denied, but the Germans had more successive failures from 1941 onwards when their forward momentum began to diminish.   The problem with Blitzkrieg was that doctrinally it focused on large encirclements and penetrations. Learning from Hutier tactics from WWI and recognizing a need to mechanize, the informal term, Blitzkrieg would characterize Wehrmacht doctrine. But there are issues with Blitzkrieg. And we see it in the Battle of Britain and the Eastern Front. Its efficacy is dependent on momentum and supply capabilities. German War Doctrine emphasized battles of annhiliation. Which while useful in open battles, were very ineffective and strategically untenable in situations of defenses in depth and terrain hindrances.  Which is why I say that German War Doctrine was flawed. Focusing on a singular overwhelming thrust works if the defensive line has a weakness, but fighting large entrenched enemies and maintaining momentum while having enough reserves to continue pushing becomes an incredibly expensive exercise as time goes on. A quick offensive is a good opener. But not a tenable long term strategy.  Given that it was up to the opposition toake a defense, it would only be a matter of time before these large offensives would overstretch supply lines or run out of reserves for momentum.  And that's the flaw of Blitzkrieg (well the colloquial name.for German War Doctrine..), it requires total superiority numerically and logistically. But as a usage of resources its rather wasteful. Case in point, the Luftwaffe losing hundreds of bombers and fighters in the Battle of Britain."

Its aim was find out what might have happened had Nazi Germany launched Operation Sea Lion, their planned invasion of southeast England during World War II, on 22 September 1940. The wargame was organized by the Daily Telegraph and Dr Paddy Griffith from the Department of War Studies at Sandhurst. The British umpires were Air Chief Marshal Christopher Foxley-Norris, Rear Admiral Teddy Gueritz and Major General Glyn Gilbert. The German umpires were General Adolf Galland (air), Admiral Friedrich Ruge (naval) and General Heinrich Trettner (land).

It was the first pure flying wing powered by jet engines.   The design was a response to Hermann Göring's call for light bomber designs capable of meeting the ""3×1000"" requirement; namely to carry 1,000 kilograms (2,200 lb) of bombs a distance of 1,000 kilometres (620 mi) with a speed of 1,000 kilometres per hour (620 mph). Only jets could provide the speed, but these were extremely fuel-hungry, so considerable effort had to be made to meet the range requirement. Based on a flying wing, the Ho 229 lacked all extraneous control surfaces, lowering drag. It was the only design to come even close to the 3×1000 requirements and received Göring's approval. Its ceiling was 15,000 metres (49,000 ft).   Since the appearance of the B-2 Spirit flying-wing stealth bomber in the 1990s, its similarities in role and shape to the Ho 229 has led many to retrospectively describe the Ho 229 as ""the first stealth bomber"".  A static reproduction of the only surviving Ho 229 prototype, the Ho 229 V3, in American hands since the end of World War II was later tested by the U.S. military, who found the basic shape, paint and laminating adhesive composition of the mockup copy would provide for 37% reduction in detection range against the British Chain Home radar of the 1940s, but no significant stealth benefit against most other contemporary radar systems.

ShitWehraboosSay,37eknw,CercleRogue,1 point,Wed May 27 06:00:55 2015 UTC,"Historikerstreit:       The Historikerstreit (""historians' quarrel"" ) was an intellectual and political controversy in the late 1980s in West Germany about the crimes of Nazi Germany, including their comparability with the crimes of the Soviet Union. The German word Streit translates variously as ""quarrel"", ""dispute"", or ""conflict"". The most common translation of Historikerstreit in English language academic discourse is ""the historians' dispute"", though the German term is often used.  The Historikerstreit spanned the years 1986-1989, and pitted right-wing against left-wing intellectuals. The positions taken by the right-wing intellectuals were largely based on the totalitarianism approach which takes a comparative approach to totalitarian states, while left-wing intellectuals argued that fascism was uniquely evil, referred to as the Sonderweg approach, and could not be equated with the crimes of Soviet communism. The former were accused by their critics of downplaying Nazi crimes, while the latter were accused by their critics of downplaying Soviet crimes.  The debate attracted much media attention in West Germany, with its participants' frequently giving television interviews and writing op-ed pieces in newspapers. It flared up again briefly in 2000 when one of its leading figures, Ernst Nolte, was awarded the Konrad Adenauer Prize for science.   Debates similar to those of the Historikerstreit in West Germany have been conducted in other countries independently of the German debate, especially after the fall of communism. In most of Eastern and Central Europe, a comparative approach to Soviet and Nazi crimes is the mainstream scholarly and official position taken. In the western world, the debate revolving around issues similar to those of the Historikerstreit was renewed following the publication of The Black Book of Communism in 1997.  The British historian Norman Davies argued in 2006 that revelations made after the fall of communism in Eastern Europe after 1989-91 about Soviet crimes had discredited the left-wing position in the Historikerstreit debate.

Most history classes I took sort of petered out by the American Civil War and then it was time for summer break.   I wish especially this speech would get a spotlight in class, there's few others that we have more to gain from.   I intend on sharing this speech wherever and whenever it's relevant."

There was a saying my Professor always said in my Genocide Studies course; that propaganda is always 95% true and it's that last 5% though that turns it sour; that's why it's so dangerous. That's the case here I think; it truly is amazing the European Axis powers managed to hold out for 7 years and it did take the combined effort of the three other largest Great Powers to take them down. That's truly amazing from a removed standpoint.  However that last 5%; that last 5% is ignoring the fact that Italians, Rumanians, Yugoslavs, Hungarians, and Austrians also comprised the Axis in a serious manner. That half of those fighting in the Stalingrad theater were these foreign forces. That the Italians comprised a very important shield in the Mediterranean holding off Allied incursion.   Yes it's true; it's fucking impressive as hell that the Axis held out as long as they did considering how absolutely off the wall bad a lot of their systems and doctrines were. However that's the Axis, not the Wehrmacht -- attributing it all to the Wehrmacht is that last 5%."

That's truly amazing from a removed standpoint.   I agree to a point.  The counter argument is that holding out for a long time does not necessarily make you all that powerful.  Afghanistan is famously referred to as ""the graveyard of empires"" because it's successfully defied Alexander the Great, the British Empire, the Soviet Union, and (arguably) the United States.  That doesn't mean that it's more powerful than those powers though."

ShitWehraboosSay,37b9fe,Depthry,4,Tue May 26 12:49:37 2015 UTC,"Saying that it took all of the other Great Powers to knock them down seems a bit odd, the Axis never would have been able to hold the larger areas of the world. It took the other Great Powers to dismantle the Axis without having to let them eradicate two of said powers totally AND countless innocents.  They also had a lot of time to fortify areas of their own territory, and the other powers invading had to ship everything over horrendous conditions. This contributed to the time they were able to survive, I feel. The Axis was certainly powerful, but I feel like 'most powerful' force is a league they don't quite make it to. Not like, say, the height of Rome or Napoleon."

More impressive than the US (and the British, although, to be fair, they had an empire to do it from, it's a little different, but still, very impressive) projecting power to two fronts on opposite sides of the world, and, with varying amounts of allied help, pushing the Axis back?  More impressive then the French continuing to resist, despite their defeat on the field, the capitulation of their government, and the exile of the only leaders they had that were willing to lead the fight?  More impressive than the Soviets holding out against the vaunted 'best military EVAH~!' despite only recently becoming industrialized and having hamstrung itself through purges?  The European Axis didn't 'hold out' for seven years, the high water mark in the east was, arguably, Stalingrad, which ended in February 1943. In the west, D-Day, June 1944. Victory in Europe was achieved on May 8th, 1945. They held out for TWO years on the eastern front, and the western allies rolled them up in less than one.  Not so impressive now.

It's a better idea to count 'strength' with 'useful budget'.  If you gave a modern military 1 million dollars and the Wermacht 1.5 or 2 million, I can't imagine any scenario where the Wermact wins. If nothing else, because the modern military could just find a decently wet area, maybe a swamp or rain basin, and pop off the enemy armor which bleeds money (expensive, delicate fuel) like nothing else, then let the infantry which is ALSO more expensive per pop (for the force fielding it...) march in with predictable, outdated tactics and get sniped by assault rifles which can out-range and out-punch anything the Wermacht expected on standard infantry.  Try to imagine being a Wermacht sniper and knowing that the enemy's standard weapons can possible oppose you at your own job. Much less their snipers, who can vastly out-range you no matter what you do.

ShitWehraboosSay,37a0y2,Chuckacanofschlitz,11,Tue May 26 02:21:28 2015 UTC,Let's not go too far - the expulsion of ethnic Germans from central and eastern Europe after 1945 was large-scale ethnic cleansing and at least 500-600 000 people died as a part of the process.  There is always the danger of the opposite to whataboutism - ignoring things that should be discussed and considered simply because they affected fewer people or enemy states. Let's be upfront with the past.

By no means were the Soviets nice people; ultimately less evil but remember, a lot of terrible things were done by Soviet officials and soldiers, and the soviets were by no means innocent. Yes, they were thegood guys. Yes, the Ukrainians and Baltics often collaborated, but things like the Holodomor and the annexation of the Baltics still happened. You don't need to measure atrocities to get that a lot of the resentment has roots in the actions of the Russians.    On a related note, isn't just so hypocritical that people whine about calling the Wehrmacht a Nazi military but never talk about how the Red Army was a Soviet military?"

By definition, such an engine can not be classified as a ramjet.  But yes, in particular a big issue pilots had to overcome was the fact that the throttles had to be manipulated rather gently.  Unlike their previous experience with piston engined aircraft, they couldn't just slam the throttle level to make power adjustments and instead would have to slowly open or close the throttle.  There were, however, proposals such as those made by Sänger, to essentially strap two big ol Lorien ramjets above the wings, over the traditional turbojet mountings on the 262."

Also, the Jump 004 gets a really bad rap despite being a decently good first gen turbojet (aha!) Engine. Its weakness was less it's fragility and more the dire state of German logistics and poor build quality. As an engine on paper, it wasn't bad, not at all. It wasn't as refined as 1945-46 British Rolls Royce Derwent or Nenes, but as far as turbojets went given its half-bakedness. Its pretty cool. :D"

Britain had a working jet engine fighter at the same time the Germans did- they just didn't want to use it for fear of them crashing in Europe- and at the bare minimum prior to WW2 Soviet scientists were playing at the idea. The longest life span of any part of the ME262 was the guns, which really shouldn't be happening.   Germans weren't really pioneering rocketry- the V1 and V2 rocket projects were incredibly expensive and incredibly ineffective for what they did- when you consider that the Soviets were strapping to the backs of flat bed trucks to greater effect.   Night Vision? Oh sure, someone else thought of that first too, but the Germans really doubled down since those IR scopes they used let them see at night. And also made sure that everyone else knew where the IR scope was.   Tanks? Granted, the Panzer 3 and 4 were superb tanks, but that's about it."
ShitWehraboosSay,374oiv,tossaway4856,9,Sun May 24 23:06:07 2015 UTC,"To be fair to the Me-262, the majority of it's unreliability was due to very very bad manufacturing as opposed flaws in the Jumo 004 engine.  The engine was supposed to be capable of around 40-50 service hours before needing overhaul but compound it with a lack of training (flameouts and damage to the engine via incorrect usage) that's exacerbated by poor materials quality and you end up with a ramjet that's frankly awful.  That said, when reconstructed, the Jumo 004 in idea conditions tested to around 50 hours. But this is assuming that metallurgy wasn't flawed or that there wasn't a shortage.   With that said, the PzKpfw III and IV weren't altogether that much better. Suffering from rather poor armor (and later almost tragically small engines) the tanks themselves were actually inferior to heavy tanks such as the Char B1. Incidentally the PzKpfw III was more useful in it's self propelled gun form the StuG.  Hilariously, the Panzer 38(t) a Czech design ended up being a surprisingly if not very effective tank until armor caught up with it's rather meagre 37mm. Which mattered little since it became the base of the Jagdpanzer 38(t) and the Marder series.  What's funny is that the Panzer IV and III weren't altogether superb in comparison to it's opposition. The original configurations were rather anemic sporting the rather weak 50mm and 75mm short barreled guns. Even the later longer barrels were at best mediocre thanks to the turrets needing extensive modification to fit the guns.  Pioneering means little if the pioneering results in relatively constricted equipment use. Also, I'm always dubious about people claiming things about the Me-262. A ramjet fighter/bomber alone could not change the course of the war. Sure it may have prolonged it. But this is under the assumption that the jet could be produced en masse (without any consequence to the armed forces) in 1942. A year where the prototypes were still using prop engines because the ramjets had issues. At a ratio of about 1:25 or so with regards to amount produced (262s vs fighters) it takes an enormous leap of logic to think that the 262s could each take down 25 planes while all simultaneously being in service."
ShitWehraboosSay,374oiv,buy_a_pork_bun,6,Mon May 25 02:03:57 2015 UTC,"Suffering from rather poor armor (and later almost tragically small engines) the tanks themselves were actually inferior to heavy tanks such as the Char B1.    The Panzer 4's armor was successively upgraded over WW2, and the Panzer 3 was probably the best cruiser style tank of the war before everyone realized they weren't terribly useful. I don't think it is wise to compare those two to the B1- the B1 is likely heavily complicit in France's defeat. The thing was an absolute monster from cradle to the grave, consuming roughly half the French armed forces budget to produce for what was effectively an obsolete tank. The hull mounted howitzer was virtually useless, and numerous other features that were entirely unnecessary were added onto the tank.   And regardless, it was less about how safe the tanks were- the 3 and 4- and more about how they were used.   Hilariously, the Panzer 38(t) a Czech design ended up being a surprisingly if not very effective tank until armor caught up with it's rather meagre 37mm. Which mattered little since it became the base of the Jagdpanzer 38(t) and the Marder series.   Because the Czechs threw everything out the window in terms of classing it in the name of having that gun. Neither the Hetzer or the Marder series were terribly effective vehicles either- the Hetzer was simply too unwieldy and the Marder series were stop-gaps.   What's funny is that the Panzer IV and III weren't altogether superb in comparison to it's opposition. The original configurations were rather anemic sporting the rather weak 50mm and 75mm short barreled guns. Even the later longer barrels were at best mediocre thanks to the turrets needing extensive modification to fit the guns.

As to the Pz IVs uparmoring, it wasn't terribly effective given that the majority of cannons by the time the Pz IV platform was retrofitted could puncture the unangled armor. Most of the first run of tanks were not particularly lethal when met with their Russian contemporaries.  You're also right about the B1, it was an unwieldy tank and one that was wasteful, but yes, doctrine determined the Pz III and Pz IV's success in france more than the tanks themselves.   The 38(t) platform was at the very least reliable and cheap though. Although like the rest of the baseline German armor, the late war happenings would overburden the chassis. Even so, I'm doing more rivet counting than anything and doctrine determined battle success in the larger picture."

Yes, it's technically true, but it's also completely irrelevant because it doesn't effect policy, the vast majority despise Iran, etc., so I take it as disingenuous to assert that the fringe love for Nazi Germany on US soil was relevant in any conceivable way.

No, it's not millions, but it's people who actually attend events, as opposed to people on the internet who say they support something but never make an effort beyond changing their Twitter avatar. They probably paid membership dues, and participated in local klaverns, or whatever they called them.  In the 1930s, the German American Bund tried to set up a training camp in Southbury, Connecticut. Southbury rejected their attempt. Other camps were built or were planned elsewhere in the country.

I can think of few groups less influential in American affairs than Wiccans.  Furthermore, they didn't all pay membership dues.  Their total official membership was estimated to be less than 10,000.  For comparison, a rally in Madison Square Garden to boycott Nazi Germany drew an attendance of 55,000 people inside with ~35,000 more choking the NYC streets, while similar rallies were held simultaneously in 70 locations total in multiple major American cities.

Over 90% of the cost was for building factories and producing the fissile materials, with less than 10% for development and production of the weapons.

I'd say that an accuracy of 1/3 on a target the size of a city probably doesn't bode well for hitting a moving carrier."
ShitWehraboosSay,36wsdb,burgerbob22,8,Fri May 22 20:46:43 2015 UTC,"It's possible, and China's alleged development of a ballistic missile that can hit moving targets is the source of the ""carrier killer"" that's supposed to make the US Navy's carrier groups obsolete or something, according to people who fantasize about the US being unseated from its place as the strongest military."
ShitWehraboosSay,36wsdb,RangerPL,17,Fri May 22 20:30:49 2015 UTC,"Anti-ship ballistic missiles are a thing and have been for some time. The Soviets had a working submarine launched one back in the 70s, but they never widely employed them due to the tubes for launching them being considered strategic missiles in SALT, and the Soviets viewed actual strategic nuclear missiles to be more important. That said, they claimed a 93% hit rate in testing.   Now, if you want to talk about standard anti-ship missiles the Soviets had some very nasty surface skimming, supersonic missiles which even have their own counter-countermeasures aboard. I, for one, am not at all sold on the effectiveness of the Navy's anti missile systems and I think a barrage of those missiles could and probably would sink a Nimitz. The issue would be getting close enough to one in the first place, which most militaries couldn't do."
ShitWehraboosSay,36wsdb,pronhaul2012,5,Fri May 22 22:30:48 2015 UTC,"A barrage definitely could, but my post is directed at the allegation that these systems are somehow uncounterable. The AShM threat has existed for decades (as you noted with Soviet cruise missiles), and while it might change how the USN deploys its carriers and lead it to modify its tactics, it doesn't suddenly render America's carriers redundant.  The Soviet 4K18 and the Chinese DF-21 both have technical limitations as well, the 4K18 was not accurate enough to guarantee a kill without using a nuclear warhead and the DF-21's onboard guidance system isn't good enough to find and identify the target on its own, so it has to rely on externals target detection and updates on its position."
ShitWehraboosSay,36wsdb,RangerPL,6,Fri May 22 22:56:58 2015 UTC,"Well, as I said, there's also the issue of actually getting close enough to fire one off. A carrier battlegroup is such a strong fighting force there are only a handful of militaries in the world who could actually get in range to attack one. I think the Soviets/Russia could have/could still do it if they really wanted to (Although the Soviets figured that they would lose significant assets attacking carriers, they viewed the potential payoff as worth it) and China could MAYBE do it, but they'd have to basically throw everything they have at it. I mean, the Chinese airforce is still mostly 70s vintage Soviet stuff, and while the MiG-21 IMO was a seriously underrated fighter in it's day, it's not going to cut it against the state of the art fighters the Navy has now.   Even then, the Navy has what, 9, 10 other carrier battlegroups left? The loss of a Nimitz would be a big blow, but not a decisive one."

As for ""no defense,"" aside from the USN's regular intercepts of significantly more challenging targets, there's this bit of loveliness from Wikipedia:   Frederick Alfred Pile, commander of Anti-Aircraft Command, studied the problem and proposed that enough anti-aircraft guns were available to produce a barrage of fire in the rocket's path, but only if provided with a reasonable prediction of the trajectory. The first estimates suggested that 320,000 shells would have to be fired for each rocket. About 2% of these were expected to fall back to the ground, almost 90 tons of rounds, which would cause far more damage than the missile. At a 25 August 1944 meeting of the Crossbow Committee, the concept was rejected.[47]  Pile continued studying the problem, and returned with a proposal to fire only 150 shells at a single rocket, with those shells using a new fuse that would greatly reduce the number that fell back to Earth unexploded. Some low-level analysis suggested that this would be successful against 1 in 50 rockets, provided that accurate trajectories were forwarded to the gunners in time. Work on this basic concept continued and developed into a plan to deploy a large number of guns in Hyde Park that were provided with pre-configured firing data for 2.5 mile-wide grids of the London area. After the trajectory was determined, the guns would aim and fire between 60 and 500 rounds.[47]  At a Crossbow meeting on 15 January Pile's updated plan was presented with some strong advocacy from Roderic Hill and Charles Drummond Ellis. However, the Committee suggested that a test not be carried out as no technique for tracking the missiles with sufficient accuracy had yet been developed. By March this had changed significantly, with 81% of incoming missiles correctly allotted to the grid square each fell into, or the one beside it. At a 26 March meeting the plan moved ahead, and Pile was directed to a subcommittee with RV Jones and Ellis to further develop the statistics. Three days later the team returned a report stating that if the guns fired 2,000 rounds at a missile there was a 1 in 60 chance of shooting it down. Plans for an operational test began, but as Pile later put it, ""Monty beat us to it"", as the attacks ended with the Allied liberation of their launching areas.[47]  With the loss of the launching sites, the Germans turned their attention on Antwerp. Plans were made to move the Pile system to protect that city, but the war ended before anything could be done.[47]"

The ""elite SS"" meme is one of the worst. SS divisions generally received priority on new equipment, were sometimes overstrength and had their own Tiger battalion, but that's largely where the differences ended, and it also held true for regular army units like the Grossdeutschland or Panzer Lehr divisions. Ironically, Panzer Lehr actually was elite because it was composed of elite training and demonstration troops.  So yes, there were some elite SS units. But there were also elite Heer units, so trying to categorize the whole Waffen SS as an elite force is retarded. God damn you Paradox for making the SS Germany's elite unit in HoI3. Thanks for helping perpetuate the myth.   you do know there were Wafffen SS and general SS both were totally independent of each other.   The Waffen SS was not independent from the rest of the SS.

It's also worth pointing out that Wehrmact leadership considered Whitman a threat to his own men and those who served under him because of this.    During the 1940 campaign in France, modern French armor was superior to that of the Germans as well as to many of the captured Czechoslovak light tanks, but the French suffered from many issues that plagued their military at the time: a large part of their equipment was obsolete, the army was caught in the middle of re-armament along with the general chaos and shock of the situation.   Further more a large number of armored units simply hadn't been trained on new vehicles. The FT17 may have been the basis for the modern tank, but it was still an aged vehicle.  And it helped nothing that something to the tune of half of the French armed forces budget was going to fund and build these monstrosities- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Char_B1 - which, performance aside, were strategically irrelevant except to point out that the Germans didn't learn terribly quickly. As early as the Battle of France Germans were aware that their AT ordinance was woefully inadequate when they knew that their AT guns and tanks couldn't touch a B1 heavy, and that instead if it needed to be destroyed and couldn't simply be navigated around or waited out, you needed to wheel a field gun into position- not unlike the situation T-34's would cause later.  Germany's success in France had as much, if not more, to do with France's own mismanagement as it did Germany's (albeit limited) understand of what the internal combustion engine meant for war. That's actually the common narrative- France wasn't ready, Poland was dealing with the Soviets and the Germans, and Stalin kind of wiped out his own military leadership which meant organizing the army was quite difficult.   When the Panzerkampfwagen VI ""Tiger"" was fielded the first time, it was a real monster. It weighed 55 tons, was armed by the dreaded 88mm gun and could withstand the fire of pretty much anything. On the other hand, it was slow, not very reliable and hideously expensive. The Soviets found ways to fight the Tigers rather quickly but their dreaded reputation was cemented by the extreme kill scores of some of its crews. From 1943, the value of the Tiger decreased with the appearance of more potent guns on the battlefield, but its price remained the same, a price wartime Germany could ill-afford.   Was it the Tiger that it took over a month for the Soviets to realize was the German's new tank?  It wasn't exactly a great tank. It's about what you'd expect from a first effort of a heavy tank, though when you consider comparable first (mass fielded, I know the US built the M6, but they had a good reason for not fielding it) efforts such as the KV-1 or M-26 it is a bit embarrassing. At a time when it was accepted that a tank needed a low profile and sloped armor, the Tiger was a barn with armored shaped to match the walls. Granted, there was a good punch behind the '88, but who cares when nothing else is redeeming about the tank? German heavy armored divisions required a supply train three times the size of a US armored division, the tanks were notoriously unreliable- never mind the logistical issues with the Tiger; possessing nothing that could adequately haul it, Germans had to use Tigers to haul other Tigers if they couldn't move under their own power. But the Tiger's engine had a reputation for dying at high revs- eventually a speed governor would be installed- that was bad enough that German high command flat out banned the practice of using Tigers to haul Tigers. I can't imagine mechanics had it easy when the German army went from tank that, on the high end weighed 35 tons or so, to one that weighed 55.   And the protection was really only credible to 300 meters from the flanks if you discount 85mm guns and field guns.    In a way, the Panther was in the same situation. On paper, it was an excellent tank and its long 75mm gun was powerful enough to knock out pretty much anything. Its side armor was, however, still vulnerable to AT rifles (leading to the development of Panther II and ""Schürzen"" side armor) and it could be knocked out from the frontal angle as well, in some cases even by Soviet 45mm guns. The shock that the Panther caused on the western front was not really caused by the quality of the tank itself but by the fact that it started replacing the Panzer IV as the principal German battle tank (unlike the Tiger, which – just like its successor, the Tiger II – remained as a specialized heavy tank unit weapon). The Panther had another serious flaw too apart from its price – it was unreliable (the best known example were the final drives that lasted 150 km), but despite these issues it was certainly one of the best tanks the Germans ever fielded – after the war the heavy and superheavy monsters died out but the Panther was fielded for example by France for a while and when – a decade after the war – the West German army started looking for new tanks, one of the initial ideas was to actually re-start a modernized Panther production.   The 75mm gun the Panther sported was more adequate for a light or medium tank destroyer rather than a medium tank. Lacking an adequate high explosive round it was sorely deficient for the kind of ordinance that would support infantry. Prior to the improved mantlet design, rounds fired on the lower half of it had a habit of deflecting downward, into the crew compartment. The panther wasn't a particularly good tank. Heavy tanks that weighed just slightly more sported better guns and were better in every way at protecting their crews, aged AT weapons were perfectly capable of penetrating the Panther's side armor, and nothing about the cost of the tank from the front end, to fielding it was particularly good. Late war German Funny Money aside it doesn't bode well when you're losing half your fleet in a major offensive to battle wear and mechanical failure rather than engaging the enemy.  And France only used the Panther because it was available, not because it was a particularly liked tank. In their report on the performance of the tank they had little good to say about it other than the gunner's scope, but even that came with the footnote that because of a lack of other optics it was useless; the gunner spent too much time trying to acquire targets.    Contrary to popular belief, Tigers were (especially late in the war) very rare. Many older wartime accounts mention ""Tigers"", ""Panthers"" and ""Ferdinands"" destroyed in large numbers but most of these tank kills were other tank models and not the dreaded ""big cats"" – for an average Allied soldier, however, every tank was a ""Tiger"", especially in the east.   For all the US's talk and reports on dealing with Tigers, they weren't terribly common in Africa, and from D-Day to VE-day there's only about 2 or 3 confirmed instances where US soldiers actually engaged with Tiger 1's."
ShitWehraboosSay,36uzn1,tossaway4856,5,Sat May 23 04:55:43 2015 UTC,"It should also be noted that being as heavy as it was, the tiger was incredibly susceptible to swamps and mud, and very difficult to recover. In fact, some the first tigers to go down were defeated by a patch of mud."

C: Eye witness testimony is notoriously unreliable.   D: The 3-encounters figure comes from an interview done with the academic Steven Zaloga, so its not like someone just pulled it out of their ass. When you ignore unit testimony and instead look at US reports compared with German reports- the Germans were prone to making shit up but they tended to need to have reliable figures on what they actually had available for, if nothing else, logistics.    How many times did US forces encounter Tiger tanks?  When you read unit accounts, whether it’s the actual unit after action reports or the published books, everyone talks about Tiger tanks.  But in looking at it in both German records and US records, I’ve only found three instances in all the fighting from Normandy to 1945 where the US encountered Tigers.  And by Tigers I mean Tiger 1, the type of tank we saw in the film.    http://tankandafvnews.com/2015/01/27/zaloga_interview/"

US troops were definitely trained on the difference between the different types of tanks. I've read several AARs about armor engagements and they name the tank type. They will say Mark IV tank or Mark VI tank or Mark V tank. While many will say vague Panzer or Tiger names, most name specific models. I want to see his sources for this. Basically he is saying that there are three instances on sources other than After Action Reports and Witness Testimonies that confirm US engagements with tigers. AARs and Testimonies should be taken with a grain of salt but they are the most common form of information about what American troops experienced and are the only real place that such encounters would be documented. They are good sources in my opinion. I've seen enough Photographs alone of knocked out tigers to outnumber his claim of 3 instances. He's eliminating most of the sources with which one would find the number of tigers engaged and relying on some unknown source to say the ""real number""."

And we can also forgive him for simply forgetting that the US had the first standardized semiautomatic rifle, that American and Soviet medium tanks were strategically speaking, more reliable and simpler to produce (with superior steel, too!) while British tanks could take a fuckload of a pounding, that all the Allies had heavy tanks (Pershing, Churchill, IS3) that were superior to the vaunted Tiger, that the Germans couldn't build a bomber for shit while the British and Americans did and could, that the Allies had the industry to motorize their logistics, that their navies were unassailable by any enemy save for the Japanese early in the war, and etc etc etc. Ooh!

The Luftwaffe was losing the Battle of Britain, there's nothing more that they could do with the Kriegsmarine, and the Wehrmacht and SS had nothing to contribute to the fight against Britain thanks to the Channel.    he could have rallied his troops for an organized and better planned assault on Russia, given how the Russian campaign went, nearly demolished the entire Russian fighting force and nearly crippled them despite the famed Russian winter, a better planned and better supplied army would have easily crushed the Russian armies.    If Hitler manages to win an extended Battle of Britain and then go after the Soviets, he's going to have a significantly reduced Luftwaffe to attack with while the Soviets will also have a much better prepared and equipped army.    The part of the United States was also a mistake on Japans part, that should have been stopped by hitler as part of the Axis Alliance. If Japan had not attacked the US when they did, the US would never have come out of its isolationist mentality until it would have been too late.   Japan has very limited options: 1) Have an economic collapse due to loss of imports from Allied embargoes 2) Retreat from China in accordance with US demands in exchange for embargo being lifted 3) Attack European colonies in SEA to secure resources and pray that the U.S. doesn't attack from the Philippines sitting astride their sea lanes.  4) Attack European colonies in SEA to secure resources and attempt to neutralize the likely inevitable US retaliation pre-emptively (historical choice).  As for coming out of isolationist mentality too late, the U.S. was already actively involved in the Battle of the Atlantic even if they weren't actively attacking U-boats yet.    If Europe and Asia had fallen before the Reich set its eyes on the US then they could have crushed the American military at the time due to superior numbers and technology.   Uh huh. Just going to quote Wiki here: ""At its peak, the U.S. Navy was operating 6,768 ships on V-J Day in August 1945, including 28 aircraft carriers, 23 battleships, 71 escort carriers, 72 cruisers, over 232 submarines, 377 destroyers, and thousands of amphibious, supply and auxiliary ships""  WHERE ARE YOUR SUPERIOR NUMBERS NOW?!   America was still fighting with ragtag equipment that barely was up to WWI standards at the beginning as they had drawn down after the Great War. The Fleet was the only real Modernized asset the US had   It's also the only one that really mattered in terms of trying to defeat the U.S. and it's not like the U.S. wasn't actively modernizing and would have been so long before SuperAxis could ever subdue Europe and Asia and come after America."

Stimson's papers - he was the Secretary of Defense. He wrote in his diary important things that went on (in his own handwriting) and under November 25th, two weeks before Pearl Harbor, he wrote, ""The President sent for us to come to the White House. I thought it was to discuss the war in Europe, but he told us that we had to be at war with Japan but he didn't want it to look as if we fired the first shot!"" That is almost verbatim. Henry Stimson, the Secretary of Defense wrote that in his diary. That is how we got into the World War, because Roosevelt said, ""We want to be at war with Japan, but we don't want it to look as though we fired the first shot""! So we got the first shot, alright, at Pearl Harbor!   Wait, so in wanting the Japanese to attack first, Roosevelt caused  them to attack first? He's even more diabolical than we thought!"

This is an informal fallacy where someone includes the conclusion they are attempting to prove in the initial premise of their argument—often in an indirect way that conceals it.   The term ""begging the question"" originated in the 16th century as a mistranslation of Latin petitio principii (""assuming the initial point"").

Frankfurt theorists drew on the critical methods of Karl Marx and Sigmund Freud.   Jog my memory, something that adopts neo-Marxist philosophy by adapting what was initially rooted in economic theory to culture is.....not Marxist?  I'm not arguing either way but when you just tell people they're conspiracy nutters what you're- most likely- doing is making them hold onto their beliefs even harder.   And unfortunately there's the crux. Every group- especially the fringes- has their share of the looney bin. There are Marxists who consider critical theory- whether it's called cultural Marxism or not- too light on the Marxism. Zero sum politics doesn't work- things aren't all one way or all the other. There are people who want to employ Marxism to- unironically- tear down Western Civilization. It's better to say, ""that's not us"" than to say, ""You're an insane conspiracy nutter."""

Which isn't inaccurate, there are people that want to end western civilization- I miss used the term, I'm talking about the modern cultural paradigm, apologies- and hope that by relentlessly critiquing everything and refusing to concede that things can be non-political, that they can somehow bring this about by trying to suggest the king has no clothes.   It hadn't just failed, it failed to stop Nazism.   Arguably the failed communist coup did more to drive a staunch response to the perceived threat- regardless of whether the Jews consulted with their space lizard overlords to drive this and / or whether communists as a group wanted this to happen, people like Adolph Hitler started thinking that his idleness was his complacent acceptance of events. Individual perception tends to drive people more than objective fact and history. Often its the case that when you try to blindly fight what you hate, you create something worse. The US invaded Iraq, destabilized what was ironically the most secular state in the middle east, and created ISIS, which is regarded as too extreme for who we thought were the extremists.

You can skip to about 3:40 if you want to just get to the part about critical theory.   The issue is that what sounds like critical theory could more aptly be applied to rote cynicism. You don't need Marxist structuring to have people reduce founding fathers to slave owners despite their own thoughts and opinions on the subject, you don't need it to reduce JFK to a horn dog prone to sexual assault, you don't need it to think that the NRA is solely about profit. People brandying around terms like cultural Marxism aren't that much different than the folks who still think we went to Iraq for it's oil. While there's some substance to the claim, wars aren't about one thing, and if it really were about oil, that was probably the worst way to go about it. We're a little too enamored with the idea that as long as everyone's wrong we don't need to worry about them being right.  For me it's just a rejection of zero-sum political maneuvering and the idea that it is fair, or appropriate to critique while offering no alternative. I don't like radical feminists who degrade the crime of rape to public flatulence, I don't like the ones who got the terms of rape set that men would categorically be held to a different standard than women, silencing thousands of rape victims because it was some how damaging to suggest that 40% or more of all rape victims are men. I don't like hipster leftists who blame capitalism for everything wrong and try to blame capitalism for the behavior of corporations, which ironically has more to do with the judicial and legal code than economic theory. It takes nothing to break things down, but to build takes real effort. Perhaps it speaks more to society that we're more interested in watching things collapse in grand fashion than anything else."

ShitWehraboosSay,36rj0u,ALLAH_WAS_A_SANDWORM,9,Thu May 21 20:13:13 2015 UTC,"This is far from true.  Hitler did in fact listen to Generals - especially the ones he didn't have fantastic rows with, and those he did he straight up dismissed. Despite this, it would be foolhardy to claim he didn't listen to his generals; he listened a great deal, especially before Kursk. The Generals that remained to be listened to were either promoted past their abilities, coping as best they could (spoiler; not good enough) or were openly sycophantic. So it was either garbage from Hitler, or garbage from his Generals. What a winning combination.   Turns out, Germany has no fucking idea how to build a coherent strategy. Unsurprising in hindsight since the country never had plans or expectations from its birth in 1870 onwards to fight a prolonged war; but showed a profound talent for ending up in precisely that.   A strong case can be made that, by 1943, the General Officers of the Wehrmacht were beginning to become a very mixed bag indeed. For every famous name one can throw around, like Kesselring, or Rommel, we can find an example of a person promoted far past their abilities, such as Dietrich, Hausser, or Paulus. The promotions were a dangerous cocktail of party politics, empire-building, legitimate losses, and in some cases by martial merit (creating a caste of dependable, but indifferent strong-men Officers). Operational Art in the Wehrmacht was deeply affected as a result. From brilliant attacks like Fall Gelb, we begin to see quirky, often disastrous deviations from well thought out plans, such as Case Blue, or suicidal or fanatically unrealistic operations, such as Luttwich, Wacht am Rhein and Zitadelle. Some fully sprang from the mind of Hitler, but he had sycophantic or equally delusional (in a folie au duex way) Generals at OKW in the form of Keitel and Jodl; men who were in their positions not because they had the Strategic minds of Zhukov, or Manstein or Eisenhower, but because they were Lackeys that said what wanted to be heard. I don't think I need to iterate the point further: It was a recipe for disaster.    Notice that I actually point out Martial merit. Some of the more capable Corps and Divisional commanders proved to be quite shit at higher command for the Germans. A nice smelly turd of command decisions that proved to be a mix of man-of-action syndrome, sycophantic tendencies, lack of legitimate alternatives and just straight up political considerations.   The bottom line remains that the German Army, at its very core, was incapable of the strategic feats and thought processes that their erstwhile enemies were thinking about and preparing for from the outset. It never was ready for a truly strategic war; just a series of  what it assumed would be isolated operations. I may consider Case Blue well thought out (and this is highly disputable) as an Operation, for example; but it was a fucking disastrous strategic decision. The idea behind tying in Operational Art to Strategic Purpose seemed to be something that faded rather fast with the Germans.  Even some of the ""better"" German Officers were 'creative' in finding ways to get more young German men killed. Germany gets a lot of credit, for example, for their practical uses of airborne infantry in 1940, but the moment they elevated its use to a larger scale; botched it royally. The resulting near-massacre at Crete? Born entirely from the mind of Kurt Student - Beevor in Crete: The Battle and the Resistance points out using minutes from the relevant meetings that Hitler actually pointed out the folly of this plan to his Luftwaffe generals; and in tradition of the German military allowed them the freedom of action to go through with it anyways.  Student's reputation somehow has survived the war, being heralded for a brilliant officer despite more or less fucking up the only large-scale airborne operation given to him. The only saving grace was that the only person who fucked up at Crete harder than Student was, sadly for the Cretans, General Freyburg. This example paints a reality of the OKW: Total fucking disconnect and unrealistic expectations of what could be accomplished. Yes, their were naysayers, but more often than not their ideas were as wrong if not more so than the Generals whom they were protesting. Blaming shit like Winter Storm, Typhoon and Crete on Hitler had and has been a convenient tactic in post-war writing to cover up everything from poor operational and strategic performance to the massacring of ethnic Slavs. Same bullshit, different thesis."

The Panther wasn't that much safer from the flanks and rear.   A Panther could last 150kms prior to the G model before the final drive ate itself alive.

Or like when you claimed that the Holy Roman Empire was a centralized state.   I like no matter how many times you apparently jack off to that thread you never once read the part where you said that and claimed that's what I believe because I said Imperial Germany was a centralized state. The conversation was literally:     The German Empire was hardly a centralized state, though.   It most certainly was; to call it not is to call any Federal state a non-centralized state. They had an Emperor who ruled over the Kingdoms and they had a pan-Imperial ""Parliament"". Just because there was a level of lower level autonomy for Bavaria, Wurttemberg, and Saxony doesn't mean that it wasn't a centralized state    So, was the Holy Roman Empire a centralized state? It had an Emperor who was at least nominally suzerain over his vassals, it had a pan-Imperial Parliament...   And from that incredible amount of intellectual dishonesty posted three months ago you have been following me around constantly saying how I think the HRE is a centralized state, cataloging my posts, engaging in debates with me over frivolous bullshit and then when I recognize you and call you out you drop these bombs of links on me saying how I'm a hypocrite and to stop harassing you lmfao.

Seriously, you're a joke. Get over yourself, and get a life.   I'm livin life pretty good; you seem to be the one obsessing over here.   Height of dishonesty, there. You claimed that a state that had a parliament and suzerainty over its vassals was centralized. I pointed out that the HRE matched that description. You somehow turned that around and claimed that I said it. You literally claimed that the HRE was centralized.   That's odd because I said    ""It most certainly was; to call it not is to call any Federal state a non-centralized state. They had an Emperor who ruled over the Kingdoms and they had a pan-Imperial ""Parliament"". Just because there was a level of lower level autonomy for Bavaria, Wurttemberg, and Saxony doesn't mean that it wasn't a centralized state""    which, nowhere, ""literally"" says the HRE was a centralized state. Nor did I say that having a parliament and an Emperor was the only condition to being a centralized state they were contrived, off the cuff examples. Now I'm sorry I jumbled my words up a bit in my original post but for fucks sake a 3rd grade level of comprehension can tell I was speaking to the tone that Federal states were clearly centralized states. You hone in on one middle sentence and ignore the rest.   Ultimately the point is and was, and you seem absolutely incomprehensibly incapable of grasping this, is that states in the HRE were sovereign states. Bavaria, Saxony, Prussia, and Wurrtemberg were not; Germany was a sovereign state and those four kingdoms and their constituencies had no sovereign status in their own right. Ultimately they all bowed to the laws of the centralized parliament universally, were subject to the military decisions of the State along with economic and political decisions. That is why the German Empire was a centralized state; yes Bavaria had a unique level of independence notably in their military uniforms, leadership, and their postal systems and such. However they were not even close to an independent actor.  There. Explained. Now add this post to your little collage that is my life and keep stalking me or something I guess.   You've been following me, asshole. Do you honestly believe that I think it's coincidental that you happen to just 'be there' any time a post harassing me is around?

He certainly had a deaf ear to the genocides that were committed and came to light after the war however.  I can separate the politics from the man though, his views are disagreeable but his bravery and his technical ability were beyond reproach - the man is synonymous with the Stuka and his book really brings the plane to life. I suspect we'll have to agree to disagree though.  Well how do you measure the greatest combat aircraft of all time? If it's the pinnacle of prop designed planes then it would probably be the P51? But thats not how I would look at it. When the P51 was operational the luftwaffe was on it's last legs already, what's more the answer to the P51 - the me262 - was only a few months away, the jet age had caught up just as the P51 was in its element. My point is that the P51 arrived too late to make a decisive impact in the war, whereas the Stuka had been in action since the very beginning - since the Spanish Civil War in fact - and had contributed heavily to every major success the Germans enjoyed, and as the war dragged on, delayed inevitable defeats. So it's less as a measure of aerial ability for me, and more as a measure of impact in the war."

It was fight or die and, if you were without a weapon, well you still have that motivation to fight and that's unfortunate.

A. Il’enkov, Krivosheev's analysis obviously conflicts with the Russian Military Archives database of individual war dead, which still lists over 7 million missing soldiers and sergeants alone, as well as opinions of the highest ranking Russian officials.[31]  So you focus in on the part that says there were only 1,238,000 POW deaths, but ignore the part where it's pointed out that your source doesn't include certain categories of prisoners in POW deaths and instead considers them civilian deaths.

Nevermind the non-aggression pact, there's more eloquent ways of debunking the argument - the entire 'we held them off!' discounts the inherent aggression in the German's policies towards the Soviet Union, and doubles down with the pipe dream that the Western Allies saw the Soviets as a bigger threat than the Germans from the get go.

The war in the East was a war of racial annihlation from its outset; what do you think would've happened to the Peoples that made up the Soviet Union had the Germans won? If you're going to compare the brutal put down of the Hungarian revolution/riots to the roving deathsquads wiping entire villages off the map, then we have some serious learning to do. Want to know why the genocide(s) perpetrated by the Nazis remain the legal standard for 'defining' a genocide, in lieu of say, worse ones numerically (hard to find, but there's cases out there)? It remains the standard because of how undeniably deliberate and in motion they were. We're talking about pre-meditated, industrialized Genocide of German citizens and others. So I really am not sure where you are getting this trite that the Germans never acted on their desire to murder Slavs en masse; have you not haerd of the Einsatzgruppen?

The Germans tried for a compromise position, which turned out to be the worst possible solution, and of course has created what-if wank material for generations to come. All it accomplished was a diffusion of armored forces; the 21.Panzer lost close to 70 vehicles before D+3 in futile counterattacks in the Orne region, and all the other Panzer units entries into the battle-zone were delayed by days and weeks.  I honestly doubt the German's ability to fight a war of movement against the Allies at this stage of the war; the Americans especially were born for open battle. Given the German experiences in September and November 1944 when they tried to do precisely that with inclement weather and fresh formations (read: Disaster after Disaster), I believe that the idea of holding them in the bocage was the best possible option."

First off Hitler whole heartily loved the Manstein plan which was actually responsible for beating France. Guderian and CO's tendency to break away and do their own thing was criticized by pretty much the entirety of the high command; hardly just Hitler.   On the part about the withdrawal from Moscow, well that was a smart move by Hitler. If Hitler had allowed army group centre to pull back the entire front would have collapsed.   Did Hitler micro manage his commanders too much? Sure. Did it make a difference in the overall outcome of the war? Not really."
ShitWehraboosSay,36a000,Sid_Burn,6,Sun May 17 18:03:47 2015 UTC,"Furthermore, I think people forget the strategic disadvantages Germany had. Sure by 1944 production had peaked, but even so Germany was ultimately going to be running on the shortest shoestring.  The war may well have been much more costly, but WWII was a death sentence for Nazi Germany, and even buying Germany one year, or three years would make little difference considering the insurmountable task they had.

Now, admittedly, with mixed results and at times questionable interpretations of the necessary burden of proof, but it shows that time and again, the American command reacted with appropriate disgust at the actions of members of their armed forces and took the necessary steps to reach something approaching justice.  By contrast (source: Riding East: The SS Cavalry Brigade) the Germans handed out combat badges* and Iron Crosses to junior leaders and enlisted who found expeditious ways to conduct 'anti-partisan' and civilian repression actions. In particular, Yerger, in the aforementioned book, cites an incident involving the sequestering of wounded partisans and civilians in sealed rail-way cars. The Untersturmfuhrer's (equivalent of 2nd Lieutenant) 'forward thinking' on how to deal with the wounded prevented 'wastage' of ammunition and won him an Iron Cross.  The example may be SS, but just stop and think how perverted a government and its military system is to go out of their way to award such behavior.   *This is in Bronze; an SS award. Silver would denote Heer; and yes, there were anti-partisan badges in Silver."

No, what's alarming about the Clean Wehrmacht myth is that, despite all evidence to the contrary, despite the broad and generally accepted consensus, it still is propagated loudly and often today.

Dismissing Soviet-historiography as biased (missing of course, the irony in relying on Wehrmacht testimony over Soviet testimony in this regard) and revisionist English-world histories as jingoistic. These same people usually then go on to quote Hubert Meyer, Otto Carius or Manstein in their memoirs and histories - upping the irony and user-bias to astounding levels. This is often fueled of course by a subtle or blatant right-wing bias in their opinions, often using moral equivalency (""but Stalin"") or taking their reasonable distaste for Stalinism and Communism to an extreme - manifesting more often than not in the conclusion that Nazi Germany, on merit of the fact that they aren't communist, was the lesser of two evils.

Basically:   This review of the Dachau hypothermia experiments reveals critical shortcomings in scientific content and credibility. The project was conducted without an orderly experimental protocol, with inadequate methods and an erratic execution. The report is riddled with inconsistencies. There is also evidence of data falsification and suggestions of fabrication. Many conclusions are not supported by the facts presented. The flawed science is compounded by evidence that the director of the project showed a consistent pattern of dishonesty and deception in his professional as well as his personal life, thereby stripping the study of the last vestige of credibility.

Implementation would have necessitated genocide  and ethnic cleansing on a vast scale to be undertaken in territories occupied by Germany during World War II.   The plan entailed the enslavement, expulsion, and/or extermination of most Slavic peoples in Europe, who the Nazis viewed as Untermensch and non-Aryan.   The programme operational guidelines, prepared in the years 1939–1942, were based on the policy of Lebensraum designed by Adolf Hitler and the Nazi movement, as well as being a fulfillment of the Drang nach Osten (English: Drive towards the East) ideology of German expansion to the east.

The leader of the partisans was a good guy, though and I think the writers wrote the other partisans as anti-Semites to showcase how widespread anti-Semitism was in Europe. I'm not saying it was a very good way of doing it, though. Perhaps if they chose for Viktor's story line to take place in France instead of Poland it would have been less of a shitlord thing to do.  I thought Friedhelm's story was pretty good and also pretty terrifying.   Otherwise the whole thing was clunky and full of a ridiculous amount of happenstance.

I can find only one genuine case of a German soldier being killed for refusing to commit atrocities, that of Ernst Grawe. I respect Grawe for his refusal but his case appears to have been the exception  edit: actually the video is even worse because the implication is that those high-up Nazis who were prosecuted at Nuremberg had no choice.

I dont know what the fuck is the point of this place, but judging by your sidebar, you think im some sort of nazi fanboy? This is a classic example of a false dichotomy. Just because i dont think all german soldiers were monsters without a shred of humanity does not mean i love adolf hitler or that i am obsessed with nazis. If you people honestly believe that all wehrmacht soldiers were genocidal psychopaths then you need to read up on your history and stop grouping everything in a black and white manner. Also i never claimed all wehrmacht soldiers were practically angels, i freely admit that many of them were fucked up. Many does not equal all. And it is well known that the Wehrmacht and the SS were not the same thing and did not operate in the same manner."

The Wehrmacht were very much just regular soldiers who fought on the front lines and many of them had no hand in the genocidal acts that the SS committed. Not saying they were all saints, of course not, but most of them were just regular guys who were just as opposed to genocide as any of us.   That's absurd. Their officers were given orders detailing how commissars were supposed to be murdered on sight, how Jews were going to be rounded up in the rear, how anyone who was a ""partisan"" would be treated, etc....It was a meticulously planned operation, and there is no way that soldiers didn't know that very bad things were going on in the areas they had just cleared.  Would someone who is ""just as opposed to genocide"" as you or I willingly take part in combat, knowing full well that with every mile of ground we took, every village we seized in our fighting, the people we just passed were going to be exterminated?  The majority of them might never have shot a Jew in the back of the head and let the body fall in the ditch, but the vast majority were either totally fine with the fact that they were enabling other people to do that, or moral cowards who didn't want to stop fighting for their evil cause."

If they had just come clean after WWII about this stuff, it would be easier to forgive.

Maybe the Germans would have done a little better if they replaced everything they had with things that were as much of an upgrade as the StG44, from tanks, to planes, to production methods, you name it.

The Allies, and the Americans in particular, had made clear early in the war that only unconditional surrenders would be accepted. The perception was that allowing the German Army to surrender conditionally in 1918, while not actually defeating the state utterly, had helped to build the Stab-in-the-Back mythology that inspired the Nazis. So Japan offering to surrender is rather like going to a store, offering to buy a $1 item for 50 cents, and then saying that they refused to sell to you when they reject the offer."

He had noticed the most popular titles in Britain in those days were about cats, golf and Nazis.  That was in 1975. Thirty-six years on - and now more than 60 years since the end of World War II - Nazi books are going stronger than ever. A staggering 850 books about the Third Reich were published in 2010, up from 350 in the year 2000.

Although my conclusion may seem premature, I always maintained that by 1940 Germany was on the path to losing World War II. In losing the battle of Britain, and proving that Germany had no navy to speak of ultimately they could not bargain for peace unless they attempted to not fight the Battle of Britain.  The moment they engaged was the moment they lost. Supply lines on the Western front were.enormous and overextended already. And the German air forces still needed time to recover and.maintain post France. Furthermore Germany suffered enormous material losses in a.bombing campaign that only strengthened British resolve. The fact that they never struck the navy meant that German superiority on the seas never could exist. By the end of 1940 Germany had sealed its fate."
ShitWehraboosSay,35ukw5,buy_a_pork_bun,2,Wed May 13 22:30:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's a counter factual we are discussing.  Part of the German problem was that the invasion of France was too successful, and nobody knew what to do with all those troops.  At this point, German national strategy was at a crossroads:   Negotiate peace (or an armistice) in the West, which may or may not have been possible, then strike the Soviet Union. Commit, with unity of command (which didn't exist) for an invasion of England with a far more focused Eagle Day and BoB than it was, and force a peace. Then strike the East. Half ass it, then strike the East.   Peace with Britain might have been a possibility, but slim. Churchill was a great war time leader, and I think mutual destruction would've been assured.  Not declaring war against the US would be required for peace with Britain in any form, I think, too."
ShitWehraboosSay,35ukw5,seaturtlesalltheway,5,Wed May 13 23:09:38 2015 UTC,"Negotiate peace (or an armistice) in the West, which may or may not have been possible, then strike the Soviet Union.   Which was practically impossible by 1940. France was annexed and the offer of peace was refused by the British administration thanks to Churchill. Striking at the Soviet Union required a time frame that even if peace was obtained in the West would not have necessarily guaranteed success. Keeping Russia was the difficult part.   Commit, with unity of command (which didn't exist) for an invasion of England with a far more focused Eagle Day and BoB than it was, and force a peace. Then strike the East.   An invasion of England was never weakened because of unity of command. An invasion of England relied on factors that were entirely impossible to address. The only formal plan was Operation Sea Lion, which as a plan would never materialize. Nazi Germany had no way of possibly obtaining transport vessels to cross the Channel nor did they end up achieving air superiority. In the event they managed to actually get across the Channel, logistics would be a nightmarish hell worse than Stalingrad. The Wehrmacht and Luftwaffe would have bisected forces and Britian having a natural defense advantage would have handily won an invasion in 1940.   Half ass it, then strike the East.   Again, I think it's difficult to say that it was half assed as much as there wasn't any other option post BoB.  Hence why my position that 1940 was the beginning of the End. Any gains from that point onward was negated entirely by the fact that the momentum would collapse on itself. Germany had to fight two fronts and that as a logistical and resource endeavour is nigh impossible. Even if Germany decided to merely defend against Russia, it would leave the Western front starved for resources.  Not to mention that Nazi-Germany most likely needed the initiative on Russia as it was only a matter of time."

It's worth looking at the idea of the ""sturm"" platoons which would consist of two squads with all StG (or more realistically all MP40, since that's what was available) and one machine gun squad.  Rather than fighting as squads that were capable of splitting into teams (at least on paper) they were basically 3 blobs of troops, because the new, inexperienced platoon leaders had difficulty controlling anything more complex.

In elementary school, we learned loads about the Holocaust, but nothing about the planned extermination of Slavs. In secondary education, my history book mentioned (in a fairly theoretical, no gory details way) that the German forces had no interest in showing mercy towards the people in occupied regions on the Eastern Front, but as far as I can remember, it didn't mention mass killings or plans of genocide. It wasn't until I did some reading on my own that I found out, for example, just how badly the population of occupied Poland were treated.

The Panther was still a medium tank also. MBT doesn't just refer to a tank with a balanced mix of those features, but to a doctrine, where there are no more heavy tanks. IIRC, the first MBT in that regard would have been the T-64."
ShitWehraboosSay,35kior,RangerPL,6,Mon May 11 13:13:42 2015 UTC,"Oh there is no question, and I am firmly in the camp that the Panther was a medium and not an MBT because as you pointed out the Germans never intended it for the role of MBT. That said there are some rather prominent tank historians who believe that the Panther was the first MBT.

(Very slow reload and two part ammo for one).   Not like the Super Pershing and Tiger Ausf. B were any better though. Hunnicutt lists 4 rpm as the maximum rate of fire with the 90 mm T15E2. The original T15E1 actually had single piece ammunition but because it was ""extremely difficult to handle the long ammunition ... inside a cramped tank turret"" they adopted two piece ammo.   The Pershing is a mean tank though. If the war had carried on past 45, the Panzer-guys would have been very unhappy.   Assuming Panzers wouldn't already be extinct past 45, IMHO something like the M45 would make much more sense since there really isn't much an M36 GMC couldn't or didn't already knock out.   To give you a general sense, in April of 1945 the Germans have about 90 tanks on all of the Western Front.  All tanks, everything, Panthers, Panzer IV, Tigers.  They had a handful of Tigers.  They had about 400 other armored vehicles, assault guns, Stug III and things like that.  So they had just short of 500 armored vehicles on the entire Western Front, from the North Sea all the way down to Bavaria and Southern Germany.  At that point in time the United States had 11,000 tank and tank destroyers, to give you some sense of the disparity in forces."

In other words, the idea that the Germans were ""more advanced"" at tank design.  This ignores the doctrinal and logistical concerns that went into the decisions to rely on those tanks, and the result of WW2 certainly speaks to the wisdom of those decisions.  The allies could and did design tanks that were easily a match for the Tiger, they just wisely chose not to produce them.  That line of thinking also tends to forget the Sherman Jumbo, which had superior armor protection and comparable penetration to a Panther (when fitted with a 76mm in the field, as it often was), with the added bonus of being extremely reliable and easy to produce because it's a glorious Sherman tank."

In other words, the idea that the Germans were ""more advanced"" at tank design.   This deeply infuriates me.  The reality is that the American AGF refused - and quite rightly, to put anything forward and into action until it had been extensively tested, proofed and streamlined for mass production. This shows maturity, care for American lives (the devil you know vs the one you don't re empty promises), and a firm grasp of the logistics of warmaking. If Leslie McNair can be faulted for his over-zealous attitude viz. the Tank Destroyer force (far too many units being formed, far too much brain drain from other services as a result), he can be praised for his staunch refusal to put into action any equipment that hadn't been thoroughly proven ready for combat.  There is no doubt in my mind that the AGF's method of attacking the issue of ordinance and equipment was the correct one. Compare and contrast the combat debut of the M4 to the Panther. The former was an overwhelming success with positive results and opinions with the British crews who operated it, the latter had a significant number's engines fail (in notable instances bursting into flames) on the fucking start-line at Kursk. The M4 also retained a heavy dominance on the enemy mediums until mid-1944; and remained satisfactory thereafter. The only thing the Germans had with a greater unbroken service time was the Panzer IV - a pre-war design.   The Americans were constantly pumping out tank designs; they just actually bothered to test them thoroughly before hurling them into combat. The Panther may have had a decisive tactical edge, but it simply wasn't a strategic or even an operational tool of much worth. The latter two win wars, the former just gets a Lieutenant out of a firefight alive, unless the ability and groundwork existed to translate tactical successes into operational successes; a talent the German army had begun to get sloppy on as early as 1940.  Note: Full disclosure, in the medium-tank wank; I'm a Sherman fan. So there may be mild user bias. The linked comment gets bonus Wehraboo points for ""1v1 me irl"" - because war is a video game.

Now survivability takes precedence over any other concern.

ShitWehraboosSay,35kior,Repulsive_Anteater,6,Mon May 11 16:17:57 2015 UTC,"To be fair though, the Sherman's advantage was the fact that there were constant improvements to the tank and that the production line for them pumped out an unreal amount of tanks. As you mentioned comparing the Sherman to the Panther is rather unfair given that the Sherman was developed earlier anyhow.  If you look at some of the tank destroyers that the US had like the M18 Hellcat, it wasn't that the US was necessarily incapable of making better, it was the logistics dictated that having a straightforward production process and lots of testing made for better vehicles than ones which only looked good on paper.  Case in point the Tiger I which was a good tank..on paper. In reality it was awful because logistics meant that it was bound to be crippled. Complexity isn't always a good thing and trying to simplify a complex thing has consequences. Given that the general consensus for the Panther was that it was more unreliable than the Tiger, it's pretty apparent how useful a tank is if it didn't work."

Its 8.8 cm armament could destroy any of the Allied armored fighting vehicles in service during the war far outside the effective ranges of their guns.""  Its ""problems"" were a lack of lubricants/seals/gaskets due to Germany's supplies running thin.  ""These reliability issues were largely solved over time with the continuous introduction of modified seals, gaskets and drive train components, as well as improved driver training and sufficient maintenance. Statistics from 15 December 1944 show improved reliability: 80 percent of Tiger IIs were operational by this period.""  That came from Jentz and Doyle, who wrote books on the Tiger tanks specifically, and did extensive research on their history and combat effectiveness.

What arguably makes them worse than wehraboos is that their fanboyism is relevant to today as much as WWII and you always get shitposts whenever a hypothetical NATO-Russia war is brought up.  They generally fall under bad military science, idiots who look at eRHA protection and penetration capabilities of various tanks and decide that Russia would roll the USA because it has more tanks. Then they wave the invincible S-400 card when you bring up reconnaissance-strike complexes and the devastating effectiveness of modern air power, conveniently ignoring that the rise of precision munitions was foreseen by Soviet military science, with men like Marshal Ogarkov predicting that they would rival tactical nuclear weapons in destructive potential, with none of the collateral damage. Of course, the technical merits of American aircraft are ignored and features such as stealth are heavily implied to be useless. If someone brings up the F-22 you're guaranteed to get an armchair pilot that brings up how a Eurofighter or F-18 locked onto a Raptor at Red Flag once (again, ignoring the scripted and restricted nature of Red Flag) and how that means the F-22 is worthless.  There's plenty of bad history there too of course, from the ""strong independent Russia who don't need no lend lease"" circlejerk to people claiming that the USSR's complete and utter failure in Afghanistan is America's fault for giving the Afghans Stinger missiles and not the USSR's for grossly mismanaging the war.

Because I'm also a cynic, I recognize that pragmatic action is necessary to fulfill the American dream of a free, classless, and prosperous Republic, rural or otherwise. And note, I don't mean classless in the Marxist sense; I'm a supporter of property rights and individual enterprise (along with a healthy social safety net). But in the early Republic, Americans were somewhat notorious for our egalitarian (crude, to European visitors) dress and manners, at least outside of the very wealthy areas of the country. A frontier society is a fairly equal society; we could use a bit of that, I think.  And yes, I realize all of this is totally unfeasible and has less chance of ever happening than Vern Troyer making the NBA. Still, a country boy can dream.

Stalingard was necessary for Case Blue to succeed, but it had already failed before the battle of Stalingard was lost.

Italy and Hungary's expeditionary forces ripped into shreds. Germany's allies begin to lose faith.   Funny enough his primary sources are:   The rest is mostly based on the rest of the work of David Glantz. Primarily Stumbling Colossus, Kharkov 1942, and Colossus Reborn.

The death of prisoners occured, and it was a travesty, but not on the scale Bacque insists nor with the deliberation and design the Germans showed.

Even that estimate is incredible sketchy   The numbers “raped” were initially modest: from 20,000 to 150,000 in Germany. But in 1992, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, in Germany there was published a book by two feminists, Helga Zander and Barbara Jor, “The Liberators and Liberated,” where for the first time a figure of 2 million was arrived at. Moreover, it was derived from a completely flawed premise: statistical data for 1945-1946 were collected in a Berlin hospital in which there were born somewhere around 500 children per year and approximately 15-20 people were listed under “nationality of father” as “Russian”. Moreover, two or three such cases were classified as “raped”. What did these “researchers” do? They arrived at the conclusion that all the cases where the father was Russian were the result of being raped. Then Goebbel’s formula from “8 to 80″ was simply factored in. However, the mass distribution of this figure took place in 2002 with the publication of Anthony Beevor’s book “The Fall of Berlin”, which was published here in 2004, and the mythical figure of “2 million” was then taken out for a stroll by the Western mass media on the eve of the 60th anniversary of the Victory."

It's true that from the AMA he doesn't seem to show much remorse. But if what he's saying is true, who can blame him if he loved planes? The fact that he was a pilot before the war shows that it was already a passion for him and the military aspect wasn't getting between him and those fancy new planes.   That man doesn't seem evil at all to me. He just happened to be born in the wrong country in the wrong time. If he was British and joined the RAF for his passion, he would be hailed as a war hero and you certainly wouldn't be talking about him killing innocents.  This is the reasoning behind my original comment on the AMA. I was trying to sympathise with a man who appears goodwilled but is being treated as a villain.

""After the war"" (I can never find a date for the claim), Reimar Horten claimed that they used a charcoal/wood glue mix coating on it to make it stealthy.    The truth is that this ""stealth coating"" was just a poor man's replacement for balsa wood impregnated into the wood of the plane in order to strengthen the airframe without adding much weight. Balsa wood was used on the also-wood British Mosquito and the Germans didn't have access to it.  Any radar absorption properties were entirely coincidental."

Problem with tracking U Boat kills is we fucking sunk most of them, so alot of tallies are estimates, especially for the ones who reported sinkings before they went out on eternal patrol. Their tonnage was most likely taken at value since they were impossible to verify. Comparatively the US and Japanese had almost immediate co operation in finding out exactly what happened in the submarine campaign, including trying to link up failures to report on the part of US Subarmines with Japanese ASW reports. We have a clearer picture of things as a result. Coupled with Allied codebreaking, sometimes tonnage counts were adjusted right after a patrol based on intercepts."

ShitWehraboosSay,348zuf,BritainOpPlsNerf,2,Thu Apr 30 15:27:00 2015 UTC,"So let's do a run down of what's happening in this Stuka pilot AMA. It was pretty late when I posted it so I didn't have time to do this.  First and foremost we have the mod of /r/StukaStukaStuka fanboying out of control. Here's his first question:   Mod of /r/StukaStukaStuka so apologies for throwing this many questions at him, but its a rare opporunity. What did he think of the Stuka as a plane? Was it a joy to fly? What version of Stuka did your Grandfather fly? What was the lowest altitude he dived to? Did he ever meet Hans-Ulrich Rudel? Regardless, what did he make of him? Also, which 'Geschwader' did he fly in? Did he see combat at Kursk and/or Stalingrad?   So fascination with a military machine is a pretty standard thing and that's all fine and dandy. The Stuka was indeed an interesting aircraft and played a vital part in the beginning of the war. No shame there but then the Hans Ulrich-Rudel questions start coming. If you haven't visited /r/StukaStukaStuka, the page is half ""look at these cool planes"" and half ""omg Hans Ulrich Rudel senpai notice me<3<3<3<3"" posts.   Let's not forget that Hans Ulrich-Rudel was an unapologetic Nazi to the end. I'll even use Wehraboos' favorite source, wikipedia, to give you an insight as to how much of a Nazi he was; ""Four mourners were photographed giving Nazi salutes at the funeral, and were investigated under a law banning the display of Nazi symbols.""  A serious set of blinders is needed to overlook the insidious nature of Ulrich-Rudel's politics. With a combat record like his, interest is warranted but his politics make adulation wrong.  After OP answers his question the mod of /r/StukaStukaStuka comes in with a reply that launches him into Wehraboo hall of fame:   Thanks so much, and tell your grandfather thank you as well. I have a great deal of respect for him and his service.   Yeah, that's not how it works with German vets. ""Thanks for providing air cover to the army that ravaged Europe in the West, North, South and East. Bang up job there, just following orders and keeping your head down, while your country went on campaigns of ethnic cleansing in preparation of the 1,000 year Reich. Respect.""  Moving down the thread we have some banter about synchronized guns firing through props.   Fw-190 as well, two MG's up at the cowl.   smh Schweinhund, please, the Fw-190 D series even had wing rooted guns that fired through the prop.   And then we get right back into the Wehrabooism. Here OP answers a question about his step-grandfather's war time politics.   Since he was young at the time he was influenced by the Nazi party and ""liked"" it, by which he means the stuff he got to do. Politics wise he wasn't interested and kept his thoughts to himself. Can't really get a straight answer from him on this one. My guess is that he was goin with the flow but wasn't a ""believer""   Seems pretty legit and like the average German of the time. But let's not forget what happens when an entire nation ""just goes with the flow."" This poster has:   Can't blame him for being cautious. They're currently putting a 93 year old paper pusher through the ringers for being there.   Fortunately, there's no statute of limitations on genocide and that paper pusher is lucky to have lead a long life between the end of the war and now, unlike the people whose luggage and money he sorted through.  And then there's this:   There's a bit of a difference between flying for the Luftwaffe and being a member of the SS.   The goddamn ""clean Wehrmacht"" strikes again. Oh, and everyone, take cover, because the sparkling, immaculate Luftwaffe is coming in for another strafing run.   What airplane did he fly? I've been interested in German aircraft and I enjoy flying the Messerschmitt BF 109. Thank him for his service. My great grandfather was in the Wehrmacht. I just wish people would understand that all Germans weren't bad. Some fought to protect their country and those they loved.   Oh get fucked. Not all people are bad and not all people are good all the time. They thought that they were fighting to protect their country but history has proven them wrong. In fact, they were fighting a war of aggression that brought the European continent, including their own beloved country, to its knees.  The reply to this is some fifth column level scheisse:   British here, The majority of us are aware and fully understand that not all Germans were Nazi's, They were only doing what they had to do to survive and protect their loved ones etc. Today i hope there are no hard feelings between our two countries, I for one love Germany!   And the reply to that is this infuriating quote:   Unfortunately it's not really the British. It's my good ole American education system that demonized the German soldiers. It's not until you're around 15-18 that you realize that german soldiers and pilots weren't really evil people. It's a shame that kids grow up thinking that.   I'm not going to go into what our very basic high school courses teach us but we grew up with such a negative view on Nazi Germany because...literally Hitler. Like literally. Hitler.   Thankfully, reason jumps into the thread and people start piling up on the Wehraboos with responses but you know what else piles onto the Wehraboos? Upvotes; that silent form of support that raises an idea that you agree with above others, almost kind of like the support that a twentieth century dictator relied on. Huh.  After that the Wehrabooism dies down for the most part and the questions are fairly standard and non-adulating. There is one ""the Erich Hartmann"" moment that gave me a chuckle, though.  Anyway, thanks for reading and remember kids, Nazis are still bad!"
ShitWehraboosSay,348zuf,Repulsive_Anteater,2,Wed Apr 29 15:24:01 2015 UTC,"There's a bit of a difference between flying for the Luftwaffe and being a member of the SS.   Not by much.  Goering was once quoted as saying that all true National Socialists should be joining the Luftwaffe, and not the reactionary Heer.  The Luftwaffe had an inherently national socialist character, if you were in the Luftwaffe and a pilot, you were most likely a young, middle-class Nazi."
ShitWehraboosSay,348zuf,blackjacksandhookers,2,Wed Apr 29 16:59:40 2015 UTC,How would you characterize the political nature of the German Navy compared to the Luftwaffe and Heer?   I've always wondered if the cynical attitudes on display in Das Boot were a bit too generous.
ShitWehraboosSay,348zuf,BritainOpPlsNerf,2,Wed Apr 29 21:34:07 2015 UTC,"I confess I don't know as much about the Navy's conduct as I do about the Heer/Luftwaffe, but I have read about one case:   The Navy were the official occupying force of the Latvian city Liepaja for a short while, with a series of naval officers ruling as town commandants. They ordered extremely brutal 'reprisal' actions in response to any signs of resistance and implemented anti-Jewish measures also. A series of mass killings followed. These were carried out in the open and were attended by numerous members of the Kriegsmarine (among others)."
ShitWehraboosSay,348zuf,blackjacksandhookers,1 point,Wed Apr 29 22:07:08 2015 UTC,"I really wish I knew, but I'm only now starting to wet my toes with naval history in WWII. I mean, the Kriegsmarine was like the Luftwaffe; a rejunavted arm thanks to the Nazis; they couldn't even boast of a strong Prussian core of officers like the Heer could. Donitz himself was clearly pro-Hitler and bought into the ideals of Nazism, I won't say he was an avowed fanatic like Goering because I simply do not know; but I wouldn't be surprised if it was true. He did, after all, owe his position to Hitler.  I know this much though; the author of Das Boot applauded the movie in and of itself, but was highly critical of its glorifying nature, portraying the crew and officers as ""just trying to do their best for their country"" was the exact opposite of what he was attempting to portray. Das Boot is, first, and foremost, an anti-war and anti-fascist novel."

I can't speak about this authoritatively but I was always under the impression that the loss of such a key transportation hub would have been crippling to the Soviet Union's logistics. If this map is to be believed, the loss of Moscow would severely inhibit the USSR's ability to move troops and resources around, particularly in the north/south directions. While this might not have instantly ended the war, it would have been a significant setback for the Soviets."

On May 2, he exposed himself to heavy rifle and mortar fire in rescuing a wounded man 200 yards (180 m) forward of the lines on the same escarpment; and 2 days later he treated 4 men who had been cut down while assaulting a strongly defended cave, advancing through a shower of grenades to within 8 yards (7.3 m) of enemy forces in a cave's mouth, where he dressed his comrades' wounds before making 4 separate trips under fire to evacuate them to safety...   The man was an avowed 7th day Adventist, and never fired a shot in anger. His aversion to violence actually made him recieve physical threats to his person from his comrades, despite him being an aidman* It also caused him, if memory serves, a brief stint in military prison before he agreed to act as an aid-man in an infantry battalion.   *source: Edward F. Murphy's anthology on the lives of WWII MOH Reciepents.    ""He could have quit."" is a ridiculous thing to say.   Sigh; I understand the logic behind this. Very likely, refusal of orders would've gotten him into a Penal battalion; service in which may as well have been a death sentence. I'm not going to argue the moral angle of this, the poster is being subjective and they are more than welcome to do so. I just want to point out however, that the accused requested  transfer to the front, as a member of the A-SS, this would've immediately placed him with the W-SS. More likely, he already had a rank in the Waffen SS, as the majority of A-SS members had reserve positions (with a seperate rank) in the Waffen SS. Shortly after, another user lays this steaming turd in our laps:   Yeah, going after someone that had no say in policies for a political party that had complete control of a country (which didn't form in a vacuum), after 70 years of what psychology how these situation doesn't seem right. He got caught up in a horrible system far greater then him. Millions of evil people didn't just collude to form the horrific policies of the Nazi party.   My emphasis.  Two syllaybles: Bull-shit.  If you were a Romanian in a SS uniform recruited in 1945, then maybe you would've had the ability to use this argument, and even then its not likely. If you joined the SS, you were an ardent Nazi. If you were a member of the Allgemeine SS then you were a fucking Nazi; the actual fucking definition of the word ""Nazi"" not just ""German who happened to be in Germany during this really awkward time"" like so many shitlords like to claim. You were a member of the inner-workings of the Government, and by merit of being a member of a pre-war SS organization, administrative or not, it meant you wanted to be there. It would mean that you. Were. A. Fucking. Nazi.   A little blerb on the administrative bit; do people not realize what that means? It says it right in the articles, he was a book-keeper; he was essentially compiling lists of victim's articles that would be for lack of a better word looted off their corpses. So, he's in the SS, that tackles the whole ""he's probably not a Nazi and is just caught up in things"" bullshit. He's a part of the Allgemeine SS, which means not only was he a Nazi, he was an active member of the party's administrative branch, which the article also clearly states. Finally, the way law works in the current German government means that there is no statue of limitations for charges relating to accessory to murder - which by helping the Nazi programs of mass extermination willingly, no matter how small, you can be charged with.   My great grandfather was a mail courier for the German army. He was shot in the head for saying that the war was not worth the loss of life. He didn't voluntarily enlist either, and what he said was pretty minor.   GET THE BINGO CARDS OUT"
ShitWehraboosSay,33faxm,BritainOpPlsNerf,4,Wed Apr 22 05:05:30 2015 UTC,"""He could have quit."" is a ridiculous thing to say.   It might be a matter of philosophy but I never liked this, and not just in the case of Nazi Germany either.    If the threat of dishonor, punishment, and death for disobedience was true at the very highest levels of responsibility of the holocaust and ""just following orders"" isn't an excuse for them, then logically it's not an excuse for anyone.    Every rank and file member of German society from that period doesn't share equal blame for what happened, but the fact is that if you didn't resist, you're guilty.  Same goes with regimes like North Korea today.  If you value your life more than your dignity then so be it, but you have to accept the guilt too.  Aside from the ""Little Eichmann"" angle of it, I also think ""you should never resist tyranny and injustice because you might get hurt"" is a fucking horrible lesson for anyone who believes in anything more than their own survival on an evolutionary level."

While no where near all military tech comes from them I know we took some stuff from the Germans and they really helped the development of both military and non-military rockets. They where far from the best though ( if you can even say there is a best) and they're not the epitome of military might. In the end I just like the appeal of their nationalistic shit like their uniforms and flag.   For me uniforms I like are:  Nazi Germany  18th century U.K.  Modern day U.S. Army  1980's U.S.S.R.

I still secretly think Porshe came up with ridiculous designs on purpose.    but the bomber losses don't co-relate to the collapse of Ruhr Industry!   This is actually true. Simple availability was hamstringing Germany's ability to produce quality steel for it's tanks, and oil was always a contentious issue long before allied bombing stepped up over Germany.

And ""opened up?"" Bitch, you were already talking about someone who's clearly not even following the rules on your subreddit. I chime in and say, ""It is neither difficult to invoke a mods ire on your board, nor is it hard to ignore your own rules."""

Stalingrad might not have lost the Germans the war outright, but it cost them the initiative. With the exception of Citatel (an extremely ill-advised attack), from that point on Germany was on the strategic defensive."
