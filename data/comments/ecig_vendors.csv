ecig_vendors,3e49bq,TotesMessenger,2,Tue Jul 21 21:17:33 2015 UTC,I'm gonna go broke real fast if every vendor keeps it up with these deals :(
ecig_vendors,3e49bq,Fapologist,2,Tue Jul 21 22:51:12 2015 UTC,What ratio pg/vg are your juices
ecig_vendors,3e49bq,gerLdsmash,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:56:56 2015 UTC,Our stellar line is 35pg/65vg and our maximum velocity line is all max vg.
ecig_vendors,3e49bq,gerLdsmash,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:08:04 2015 UTC,Cool. Just made an order.
ecig_vendors,3e49bq,gerLdsmash,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:36:25 2015 UTC,"Awesome! Your order will be crafted soon and sent on the next shuttle to earth! Thank you for your business, enjoy!"
ecig_vendors,3e49bq,TheSporkDealer,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:58:33 2015 UTC,"No problem, two years ago when I first started vaping I ordered from you guys. The moon rock madness and solar flare we're the flavors that completely made me a vaper"
ecig_vendors,3e49bq,lordunholy,2,Wed Jul 22 01:59:21 2015 UTC,"Wow, we are quite honored to hear that! I'm sure the flavors you ordered will live up to your fondest memories of the beginning of your vaping journey. Thank you for the kind words."
ecig_vendors,3e49bq,yohankenobi,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:59:48 2015 UTC,You reformulated your original lineup for more VG? Why didn't anyone tell me!  I haven't vaped your juice since I switched from clearomizers to drippers.  Looks like I might need to get some old favorites and see if they still hold up.  Now might also be the time to try your newer Max VG liquids.  Thanks for the sale!
ecig_vendors,3e36rb,Tinavape,3,Tue Jul 21 16:37:48 2015 UTC,"""Comb The Desert"" by The Schwartz is the best damn peanutbuttery vape I've found!  Love that stuff!"
ecig_vendors,3e36rb,casualLogic,2,Tue Jul 21 17:23:11 2015 UTC,"Soooo good. Their whole line is good. And when I say good, I mean great."
