In this stage of the evolution of the game it is in my opinion very important to build strong local communities to give the game a strong basis for the future. German and France scenes are role models here imo. We have to appreciate those because there is still a huge language barrier even though many people don't realise it (as you can see in this post). Those people have to have an easy connection to the eSports side to get them involved. I myself only am in this scene because of a local caster like that.   Big shoutouts especially to rememberme, Naruto and Olli for their continuous work."

starcraft,3dyz9z,ez11,32,Mon Jul 20 19:20:54 2015 UTC,Not to mention how little Lycan actually know about the game. He might work out though. Maybe he can try to be entertaining while nathanias casts the game :p
starcraft,3dyz9z,lxFigHteRxl,24,Mon Jul 20 21:11:26 2015 UTC,It's going to be hilarious when Lycan completely bombs on the cast and is dropped by the next broadcast. Let's just sit back and watch the crash and burn

starcraft,3dyz9z,MSCisStupid,14,Mon Jul 20 18:24:31 2015 UTC,He's going to crash and burn so hard. I'm going to go through the VOD of the broadcast and take snippets of all his missteps and mediocre analysis and put it together in one clip
starcraft,3dyz9z,JaineZerg4,4,Mon Jul 20 21:32:34 2015 UTC,"Lycan is going to have to impress the shit out of me with his play-by-play.

I mean it's nice that Lycan is trucking along and is 'passionate' about the game, but Youtube is filled with passionate and shitty shoutcasters."
starcraft,3dyz9z,ProxyHatchGG,6,Mon Jul 20 19:33:09 2015 UTC,"How does that bother you? Are you reading his tweetfeed, or listening/watching the cast?"
starcraft,3dyz9z,DevoreSekk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:57:43 2015 UTC,i do both.
starcraft,3dyz9z,Gunesh90,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:59:17 2015 UTC,"Well, people have multiple interests, so they will post different kinds of things. Kaelaris is an esports commentator, not just starcraft (or at least has aspirations), and his twitter isn't restricted to just SC2. He'll post things about other games, events, news tidbits, and personal stuff. When you're following a person, or a personality, that kind of implies they're not 1 dimensional. There are social media tools that allow you to filter on hashtags, maybe that's what you need.  It still doesn't affect his ability to cast SC2. Nathanias, whom presumably you believe has sufficient levels of SC2 passion, posts all the time about his personal life, travel, his stream, and other things having nothing to do with starcraft or even esports."
starcraft,3dyz9z,DevoreSekk,2,Mon Jul 20 21:23:59 2015 UTC,How dare you! The silver hive mind of screddit doesn't take kindly to promoting playing sc2! (Most people here don't even really play the game).
starcraft,3dyz9z,lxFigHteRxl,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:15:06 2015 UTC,I thought Kaelaris was a regular diamond league player pre-ladder adjustment?  That would put him at a higher level than Lycan.

starcraft,3dyz9z,EmoryToss17,11,Mon Jul 20 18:57:58 2015 UTC,Maybe but it was the community WHO all wanted MMR decay to go away because they got matched against people at much lower skill level because of it.
starcraft,3dyz9z,Nomisking,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:06:04 2015 UTC,"Agreed, and I'm not saying it wasn't a good change, I'm just saying it makes Kaelaris' diamond more of an accoplishment than Lycan's imo."
starcraft,3dyz9z,EmoryToss17,3,Mon Jul 20 19:26:59 2015 UTC,This is exactly it. I have a few accounts that I practice on. Almost every season I got deranked to gold or plat. Supposed to be in Masters and it is very rare for me to lose vs anyone below diamond unless they are protoss.
starcraft,3dyz9z,lxFigHteRxl,30,Mon Jul 20 21:20:21 2015 UTC,That is because diamond was smaller than it was supposed to be and masters was harder to get into than gm. I was playing 10 time high masters that were stuck in diamond. One of them was high masters with a really good record before he randomly got demoted to diamond the next season for no reason. The ladder system was broken as fuck and now it isn't.
starcraft,3dyz9z,lxFigHteRxl,17,Mon Jul 20 21:17:53 2015 UTC,"Right, but being in diamond when it was really small is better than being in it when its big.  Pretty simple."
starcraft,3dyz9z,EmoryToss17,16,Mon Jul 20 21:27:43 2015 UTC,It actually wasn't that much different believe it or not.

starcraft,3dyz9z,lxFigHteRxl,9,Mon Jul 20 21:23:30 2015 UTC,Well they can't really just split up and have one solo cast. They are definitely looking for one (1) person. Having only Rifkin or ZG go would be terrible
starcraft,3dyz9z,Dunedune,14,Mon Jul 20 19:05:10 2015 UTC,"ZG and Nate would probably be as good as Lycan and Nate.  I'm not sure Rifkin and Nate would be good, Rifkin is worse at talking over people while they are talking.  Not sure Rifkin can be a co-caster instead of lead caster."
starcraft,3dyz9z,djcahill,6,Mon Jul 20 19:07:57 2015 UTC,"ZG and Nate would be much better than Lycan and Nate.  ZG is an actual caster.  Lycan is a... idk, just a random dude who Destiny decided to hang out with for a talk show."
starcraft,3dyz9z,EmoryToss17,4,Mon Jul 20 19:38:02 2015 UTC,"Yes sure but they are not going to put down Nate. See it this way: ESL is looking for only one caster.  I don't know if they have been proposed, but it's a good call to not split up the Rifkin+ZG team and have one cast many hours in a comfortable studio at ESL while the other is let down."

Calling it now, in a few hours there'll be some tweets from relelvant community members and another post on the sub talking about how toxic the comments in THIS thread are.  Here's whats up. You don't have to like Lycan. And you're not wrong to criticize the choice by ESL to recruit him to cast WCS. But there's a right way and a wrong way.  I personally don't enjoy Lycan's casting. But I'm not about to ignore the fact that he's a human being who works REALLY hard to be involved in a scene he loves.  This is how you make people think twice before putting themselves out there for the community. I make some Starcraft content and I'd love to build myself a little fanbase of people that enjoy what I do. But I certainly wouldn't feel good about myself if I saw these types of comments about me.  We need people like Lycan. There are better ways to express your disappointment/disagreement with this post."

We don't need those people?
starcraft,3dyz9z,PcaKestheaod,-2,Mon Jul 20 19:20:20 2015 UTC,"to be fair, the platform(TLG I'm assuming) is just the same already known personalities being recycled in the sc2 sphere. He doesn't really take any risks in that regard. He does put a lot into SC2, which is awesome, I don't think people are really disagreeing with it there. I just think its a bit disingenuous, because I'm sure there are other casters who have put the time in (Rifkin, ZG, even Madals. I'm assuming Gretorp couldn't) that would appreciate the opportunity. It's possible they turned it down, and it just kind of fell into Lycan's lap, but just my thoughts about it. Regardless, hopefully he makes the most of it and does really well with his casting."
starcraft,3dyz9z,byzzz,7,Mon Jul 20 19:51:36 2015 UTC,"to be fair, the platform(TLG I'm assuming) is just the same already known personalities being recycled in the sc2 sphere   Well not only do I think that that's actually really important, it'd also be wrong to say he doesn't give the new faces access to that same platform.  Regardless, I'm not saying I LIKE the choice by ESL here. I do think that Lycan isn't the best person to fill the spot. But the people in this thread aren't voicing that opinion in the right way.  Remember too, Rifkin/ZG are both just back from Cali and probably aren't available/don't want to travel again so soon, they probably just want to get back to Basetrade. Madals is in the UK and the amount of undeserved hate Madals gets heaped on him from this subreddit makes him as dangerous a choice for ESL as Lycan is. So yeah its probably a case of 'there was no one else'. It doesn't matter. Lycan is important to the scene and the sort of talk that's in this thread is exactly the type of talk that discourages people from getting involved with the scene. This is how you slow growth."

We have our broadcaster rewards program (with over $50k a month of bonus') link and subscriptions and donations built into the site from day 1.  The big bonus I would say from a streamers POV is that you have things like a broadcast scheduler to let your follows know when you plan to go live, the broadcast app is super easy to go live and we try to have the best support possible!"

Even someone with amazing internet can get buffering if the data has a problem somewhere else in the network.

Carried to talkshow relevance by Destiny and Incontrol, now being carried to the slightest casting relevance by Nathanias.  This should be a lesson to this sub that literally anyone on here can be a community figure worthy of attending the blizzard summit if they work at it,I guess.  /u/Lycangrope: serious advice right now: put less time into networking behind the scenes to get gigs like this, and more time into actually improving your product and your brand, (i.e. game knowledge and hosting skills) and then the success will come.  Right now it just appears to most of this community that you're trying to take the shortest route to success, and that you haven't yet earned it, which doesn't engender good will from anyone.  The way you're playing the game (the metaphorical game, not the actual game of starcraft) is drifting you towards Winter status, when you want to be aiming for something like Rotti status.  Not trying to be mean, I'm just saying."
