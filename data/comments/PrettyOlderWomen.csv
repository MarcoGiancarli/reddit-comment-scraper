His syndicated news/talk show The Alex Jones Show, based in Austin, Texas, airs via the Genesis Communications Network  and WWCR Radio shortwave  across the United States, and on the Internet. His websites include Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.    Jones has been the center of many controversies, including his controversial statements about gun control in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.  He has accused the US government of being involved in the Oklahoma City bombing,  the September 11 attacks  and the filming of fake Moon landings to hide NASA's secret technology.   He believes that government and big business have colluded to create a New World Order through ""manufactured economic crises, sophisticated surveillance tech and—above all—inside-job terror attacks that fuel exploitable hysteria"".  Jones describes himself as a libertarian and a paleoconservative.  New York magazine described Jones as ""America's leading conspiracy theorist"",  and the Southern Poverty Law Center describes him as ""the most prolific conspiracy theorist in contemporary America.""  When asked about these labels, Jones said that he finds himself ""proud to be listed as a thought criminal against Big Brother"".

PrettyOlderWomen,2koqk6,cyanocobalamin,2,Wed Oct 29 16:43:56 2014 UTC,"Story time!   Years ago, I went to this wedding and spent a glorious, sex-filled weekend with a young, beautiful hotel valet. Those were the days. <sigh>   Anyway, he used to work for some fancy hotel in NYC. I don't remember the name . . . I got the impression I was supposed to know of it.   He was telling me stories of their celebrity clients, many of whom, like Stowe, used an alias during their stay. When Stowe's alias would come up, all the male staff would argue over who got to help her.    She'd told a previous employee, who she'd spent the night with, that she worked a lot and had no interest in or time for long romances. So, she was in the habit of spending the night with hotel valets, bellhops, drivers, etc.   He said even beyond that, she was well-liked, polite to all the staff and tipped well.   This story just made me like her more. As someone who's banged my share of hotel staff, including the guy who told me this, I like her style.   The only other story I remember was about Kristen Dunst, who was also a regular. There was a stairwell for staff only and he walked in to find Dunst screwing a guy (someone in a band I vaguely recognized . . . I forget . . . ) against the wall. They were both loaded and reeked of alcohol and weed. He said she was like, ""Oh, sorry!"". To be funny he asked, ""Enjoying your stay?"" Her and the guy laughed. He said he just kept walking and they went back to it.   Oh, to be young again.   (Of course, I only knew this person for a weekend, so, he could have been lying. But these actresses were pretty obscure, even at the time so, I'm not sure why he would have picked them in particular. He came across as sincere and non-judgmental about it. I believed him.)    Edit: Just texted my friend whose wedding I was attending at the time. It was in 2003. So, Stowe was about 45 at the time."
