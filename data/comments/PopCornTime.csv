The player still doesn't pop up as an option. I also have VLC installed which doesn't show up either.  Only workaround I figured out is to press 'U' while the stream is playing in Popcorn Time > go to MPC-HC > Open File > Paste the stream URL > Open.

Torrenting takes files from many different people (seeders), and the download speed you're getting is dependent on the connection between your computer and those computers. Theres nothing you can do to increase your download speed, as your computer is already capable of achieving greater speeds than what you're getting. The problem isn't on your end."

PopCornTime,3drpui,Kafke,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:08:09 2015 UTC,"Sorry for being brief. That last comment was on my iPod. To clarify:  /r/PopcornTime is for the software provided at popcorntime.io. It's the ""most official"" and closest to the original. But given the open source nature of Popcorn Time, anyone can easily modify/upload it.  .SE is another popular one, but is generally not recommended because it's closed source, has malware/ads/etc, and generally cuts down quality just to try and look better (showing movies that aren't available, giving cam recordings, etc).  Ultimately, you should be getting it straight off the .IO website rather than anywhere else.   The movies did not seem to update, and covers were vanishing left and right, making it seem like support for the client had been dropped or something.    Sounds kinda sketch :P.  To clarify on how the .IO one works... The front end (what you see and the program itself) is all written by the popcorn time team (over on PopcornTime.IO and they are here on the subreddit as well). The program grabs movie torrents from the release group ""YIFY"". You can find their website over at YTS.to. That's all the movies that will be available. And AFAIK, it's all legit stuff. Not the best quality, but they are small file sizes and pretty popular.  The information about the movies (synopsis, cover image, etc) are all grabbed from Trackt.TV.  TV shows are grabbed from EZTV, and anime from Haruhichan.  All of these sources, from my own personal experience, are legitimate.  Any other version of 'popcorn time' (on other sites, not .IO) may use other sources, or have inconsistent displays of movies.  Hopefully that clears things up."

I read about PT on wikipedia, and under the section ""Relocation"", I was led to believe that the .se site was no the unofficial official site. After getting that client, sure enough, it looked like the client had gotten an overhaul etc., which furthered my impression that the .io might have been discontinued.  I should have checked reddit, as with all things. It's unbelievable how much information is available here, and how helpful everyone is in answering questions.  Once again - thanks for the information! The .se version has been removed, and the .io updated itself when I launched it, and all covers seem to be there and it's all working as it should. Cheers!  On a side note: there have been talks in Norwegian media about the legality of it all. The opinions are divided. Any of you know exactly what law in Norway it would fall under? And whether or not - as per today - they would be able to get a conviction? (I am planning to get the paid VPN-service just in case, though)"

Also popcorn time is based on bittorrent, which is peer to peer, so if you're streaming slow it's either a bad torrent or a bad connection, and there's no way to fix it without switching to another torrent or connection."
PopCornTime,3ds213,s0ft_,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:40:11 2015 UTC,"Using a VPN will not increase your speed. I mean, the data has to go to you either way. The VPN just encrypts the data through another server. It's still good to use though, for a variety of reasons.  Anyway, PopCorn Time is not in a single location, because it is based on Bitorrent. Bittorrent is peer to peer so there is no central location.   However, the movies come from YIFY as far as I know. I'm not a fan of his movies, but that's me.   You should still use your VPN though."

However, there currently seems to be a bug in the scraper for EZTV's torrents (the TV section of popcorn time), which misses torrents that have a specific naming format (only catching ones that have a particular format). This leads to a lot of torrents being missing in popcorn time.  It's a quick fix. So I'm wondering what's taking them so long to get around to it."

PopCornTime,3dnvyj,acrowsmurder,2,Fri Jul 17 20:16:51 2015 UTC,"Short answer: No.  Long answer: Popcorn Time doesn't actually touch the content. It's all uploaded by YIFY/EZTV/Haruhichan. Meaning the content that's available is solely dependent on those groups/sites. The way popcorn time works (for movies) is by using the API to grab the particular movie, look up information via Trackt.TV, and then download/stream the torrent file. In order to have 'special features' you'd have to have several different torrents for each set of options. Which, AFAIK, there's no centralized source that does this. YIFY in particular I know strips all the DVD stuff from the movies, and just has the movies uploaded."

If the risk is still pretty high, then I'd rather not take the chance seeing as how my internet provider may  suspend/stop me from using their service if I get caught anymore."
PopCornTime,3dj0ze,wallydz,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:26:43 2015 UTC,"Vpn.ht is reliable i can personally assure that , but i really recommend you that you personally test and not wait for a review from unkown source , get only VPN provider that offer refund if you are not satisfed"

All I need to know is what the likely hood of my being caught DL/UL videos via the P2P Popcorntime method using a VPN would be. If the chances are high that I will be caught still, then I don't want to mess with it. However, if it is for the most part reliably safe, then I would like an explanation of why and how if possible, so I can understand it and learn."

PopCornTime,3dic4w,Luretrix2k,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:00:09 2015 UTC,"That's the problem, for Chromecast to be a play back option you have to disable your VPN. Then PT see the Chromecast, re-enabling the VPN after PT has been started is pointless as PT has already made it's connection using your normal IP.  I hope I have this wrong."
PopCornTime,3dic4w,Luretrix2k,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:13:07 2015 UTC,It's not ilegall for you to open popcorntime.  The ilegall part is when you start downloading/streaming ilegall content.And as long as you connect your VPN before doing any downloading/streaming you are protected.They can only prove that you are opening popcorntime and that's not ilegall.  They can probably also see that you ping YTS or EZTV depending on witch start screen you use but they wouldn't be abel to prove that you have downloaded/streamed any ilegall content as long as you connect your VPN before doing any streaming/downloading.
PopCornTime,3dic4w,ljhere,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:21:24 2015 UTC,"Same issue here. I guess PCT will not detect Chromecast if not on the same IP. And yes, PCT will run on VPN even if activated after chromecast detection."

PopCornTime,3dhdjp,Houwert,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:38:12 2015 UTC,"It depends on your local laws.   If downloading is illegal and actively prosecuted in your country you should use a VPN. If you do not use a VPN while downloading movies you can get legal issues.   If not, you can ""safely"" use Popcorn Time. But better safe then sorry so be careful.  Where are you from if I might ask?"
PopCornTime,3dhdjp,Houwert,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:24:18 2015 UTC,"US, New Jersey to be exact. If you could, find out for me that'd be helpful. I'm kinda busy at the moment. Thank you. One of my friends lives in New York and has been using it from January and nothing has happened. I don't know though. Also, you aren't downloading the movies exactly though right? It's the seeding that's the part that'll fuck you over, correct ? Sorry for being a noob at this stuff."
PopCornTime,3dhdjp,Houwert,2,Thu Jul 16 23:00:30 2015 UTC,"Hmm, you're from the US. So now it depends on your ISP (Comcast Verizon etc).  Let me explain how the copyright trolls find you: When you're downloading/uploading a movie the other bittorrent clients are able to see your IP address.   So what these trolls do: They join the party and register all of the IP addresses they can find. They get the ISP for every US IP they can find and send a letter to the ISP. The ISP can either give your personal details to them, forward you the letter, give you a warning, or do nothing at all.  In the first two cases you're in serious trouble. Most copy right trolls are a scam, but they are still annoying as fuck. They send you a letter claiming you owe them $......, most of their victims pay it immediately. Those who do not will often be left alone, pursuing legal action could be more expensive then what they claim you owe them.  In the third case you can be in some trouble if it happens often. Your ISP can give in and give your details to the trolls or forward their letters to you. Or even worse, they block your internet connection (not sure if they still take such measures, I'm not from the USA).  In the fourth case you are relatively safe. Your ISP refuses to give in and protects its customers. BUT: their mindset can change/be force to change. Some ISP's used to ignore every letter they receive, but decided to take action later on. Or they are forst to give in by being sued.  Conclusion: Just get yourself a VPN. It's relatively cheap and saves you a lot of worries. Please tell your friend to use a VPN as well. You never know what can happen, better safe then sorry.  Y=So you can choose:    Pay +- 5 bucks a month for a VPN and be safe.  Do nothing and get sued for a couple of thousand bucks (an old article from TF)"
PopCornTime,3dhdjp,Kafke,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:21:34 2015 UTC,"I think I'm gonna get one. My provider is Verizon fyi. But, should I get the one built into PT or get a outside one?"
PopCornTime,3dhdjp,Kafke,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:43:28 2015 UTC,"VPN.HT is the build in one. 30 days money back guarantee and first month just 1 buck. It's easy to activate when you're about to use PCT.  But others will work as well (like private internet access), they're just not build in into PT. Besides that there is almost no difference.  If you decide not to use VPN.HT, make sure the other VPN service allows p2p/bittorrent. Otherwise it will be useless."

PopCornTime,3dgs4b,Kafke,3,Thu Jul 16 05:18:14 2015 UTC,"""Popcorn Time"" is an application that leverages a few libraries/apis to make a netflix-like front-end for streaming torrents.  The movies in the 'movie' section are uploaded by the release group ""YIFY"", you can find their website here. You can directly download the torrent files on that site (instead of streaming through popcorn time). Whenever they put up a new movie, it appears on popcorn time. The popcorn time team is not YIFY. It's two separate groups.  For TV shows, the stuff is from EZTV. And anime is from haruhichan.  The Popcorn time team (and thus popcorn time itself) have nothing to do with the content that's available. None of it is uploaded, handled, or managed by them.  All popcorn time does is make a pretty UI that grabs all the information, and then torrents the movies/shows in a specific way that lets you stream it.  IIRC they recently put in an option so you can use your own torrent files in case something isn't on there."
PopCornTime,3dgs4b,Houwert,2,Thu Jul 16 05:29:38 2015 UTC,IIRC they recently put in an option so you can use your own torrent files in case something isn't on there.

PopCornTime,3d96u7,GovernorKrell,2,Tue Jul 14 23:53:50 2015 UTC,"In my experience, so many titles on PopcornTime are not available in multi-channel audio formats in order to keep the file size down for streaming purposes.  A lot are just in stereo.  In terms of your setup, it looks like it should work.  You may have to change your TV settings to have the audio output go through the coax, or change the receiver settings to use the coax input.  There also may be a chance that if you don't have a 5.1 source, that audio will not go through your coax at all and default to another output.  Have you tried using a different 5.1 source like Netflix through the chromecast?"
PopCornTime,3d78us,PrivateTaters,3,Tue Jul 14 01:49:25 2015 UTC,Just contact them here and they will provide you with all the answers regarding their VPN service:  https://vpn.ht/contact
PopCornTime,3d78us,Luretrix2k,2,Tue Jul 14 06:50:36 2015 UTC,3 is the maximum users that can be logged into the same account at once. Yes its safe to use the built in VPN. Its really your choice if you want to VPN the whole computer or just PopCorn.
PopCornTime,3d78us,eNaRDe,2,Tue Jul 14 19:46:07 2015 UTC,The built in one actually makes the whole computer (at least for macs) use the VPN. It's just a script which automatically sets the VPN preferences.

PopCornTime,3d1ogt,soybjs,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:57:46 2015 UTC,"Sure. First install Crouton, you'll have more details in r/Crouton, but basically you can follow these instructions and these to be able to run it from a Chrome tab.   After that, you'll need to pimp a little bit your Ubuntu here. Not compulsory for Popcorn Time, but still a nice thing to do.  As for Popcorn Time itself, follow these instructions and you'll be ok.  Hope that helps!"

The line should read PopcornStyledMediaReceiver.APP_ID =DefaultMediaReceiver.APP_ID; Reboot Popcorn Time * If you have PC, it should be the same, just have to look for the file ""pt-media-receiver.js"" in the Popcorntime folder.

PopCornTime,3d1hk9,TreeQuiz,3,Mon Jul 13 20:43:29 2015 UTC,"Sure. First download VPN Gate a free public vpn client.   If you really want to be safe from your isp get download VPN Watcher to prevent ip leaks. Its a killswitch so when if you get disconnected from vpn gate it will immediately close whatever programs your assign.   After downloading and installing VPN Gate open it. You should see something like this. Double click VPN gate public vpn relay servers as highlighted in the picture. Now you'll see a list of server. You'll want to choose one in your region or close to it and with preferably low ping. Once you found a suitable one press Connect to vpn server. If it fails to connect try another one. Getting a server with low ping and high line speed will give you better download speeds. Then you're done here.  For the the killswitch(Vpn watcher) download and extract it somewhere. Now open it. For the next part make sure you're connected to vpn gate. You'll see an adapters list at the top, choose the VPN Gate client adapter then click the save icon.   Next you'll see a little box labeled Apps. Type in this box Popcorn Time and whatever else programs you'd be using with vpn gate like utorrent. Then you can minimize it and its happy downloading/streaming!  Hopefully this helped you. I'm not the best at explaining things so if you need further help just ask!"

PopCornTime,3cpddq,SanDiegoBrah,4,Fri Jul 10 00:26:55 2015 UTC,"The code that you just replaced is not used in the application, at all. The actual change that was made in the update is in device.js (same folder). And if I'm not mistaken, you could even remove the whole ""pt-media-receiver.js"" file and it'll still work the same.  Besides, the detection of the Chromecast has nothing to do with which receiver you use. Since we use SSDP discovery to detect the DIAL service that the Chromecast emits.  Full repository: https://git.popcorntime.io/mirrors/chromecast-js  Why it worked? Probably because you restarted the app and the Chromecast decided to emit at that exact moment."

I was sharing to my Smart TV using Samsung's screen sharing, not chromecast. This issue probably isn't even about the chromecast app at all."

I was on the PC, looking through the app to see what I wanted to watch, and noticed that if you click the little Popcorn/Dropdown box while on a movie/tv show page, one of the options is an Apple TV that you have on that network. I tried a couple of minutes of a few movies and it worked fairly well. Note, that both my PC and Apple TV are wired via ethernet. Doubt that matters, but just an FYI..?"

PopCornTime,3cr907,destructor_rph,3,Fri Jul 10 03:19:26 2015 UTC,The seasons/episodes that are missing is due to the way that popcorn time scrapes episodes from EZTV. Why it's not fixed is anyone's guess.  Popcorn Time does not manually add content. That is up to the providers (YIFY and EZTV).

After you watch them they won't be in watch list anymore.  And i think it shows only if the episodes have appeared in last 30 days.

PopCornTime,3clw2i,iphsyko,10,Wed Jul 8 22:44:28 2015 UTC,"A VPN hides your IP address from the swarm (it instead show's the VPN's IP). Essentially this means that when the MAFIAA comes to grab a list of IPs to send DMCAs to, you won't be one of them.  I've never personally used a VPN, and have never gotten a DMCA notice. But it's generally good practice to use one. It's kind of like a torrenting condom :P"
PopCornTime,3clw2i,Kafke,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:14:48 2015 UTC,"So what happens if I use the VPN build in Popcorn time while i stream a movie, and then tab out of PT to check e.g my facebook on a browser ?"
PopCornTime,3clw2i,c4pper,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:09:33 2015 UTC,"Depends on what traffic is routed through the VPN.  If you're asking whether someone can link the VPN's IP address with the IP address you have when you sign into your Facebook account, which is traced through the torrent and pulls up the Facebook login info.... that's incredibly unlikely.  To start, the IPs grabbed from the swarm (if they are on the torrent at all) aren't ever checked or looked into. They have a quick ISP lookup done, and a letter is sent. No follow up.  To get the IP logins from Facebook, you'd need to have a warrant, AFAIK. And you'd have to know which user account to check. You can't simply say ""which account did this IP access?"" (Facebook probably could, if they log that stuff though).  On top of that, it'd still only trace the IP back to the VPN. So at worst you could say that you (Facebook guy) shared a VPN and thus an IP with someone who pirated a movie on Popcorn Time (or rather, YIFY torrents).  And that's after a fuckton of work. It'd be easier for them to just follow up on the IP log after they find out the ISP. Follow it a bit further, and push to get your info from your ISP. But given you are using a VPN, they'll likely chase down an easier target.  And that's assuming you are using the same VPN for both services. IIRC Popcorn time's VPN feature only routes Popcorn Time's traffic. Not all of the traffic from your computer."
PopCornTime,3clw2i,Kafke,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:15:35 2015 UTC,It got too technical for me... thanks for the answer though :)  So I should stay at Popcorntime when my VPN is activated - and wait with browsing the internet until I have turned the PopcornTime VPN off ?
PopCornTime,3clw2i,c4pper,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:26:54 2015 UTC,"The short answer is that it doesn't matter. Feel free to browse the internet while using popcorn time.  The longer answer, as I said, depends on what kind of VPN you are using and what programs it's effecting, as well as whether you think anyone gives a shit that you are using a program thousands of other people are using.  Really, the whole point of using a VPN is to deflect DMCA trolls. No one's going to look further into the matter when they can chase YIFY themselves, rather than the thousands of people who download the torrents.  For the record, I don't use a VPN at all."
PopCornTime,3clw2i,Kafke,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:30:29 2015 UTC,"Great, thanks :) I'm using PopcornTime's build in VPN btw (the little padlock in the top right corner of PT)"

PopCornTime,3clg1h,vbp6us,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:34:05 2015 UTC,Chromecast does not have a p2p engine and therefore needs to get the information from the phone or whatever device you are using popcorn time with.

You can find various copies for free online. Maybe check some other discussions which one is considered a good one. Never use the cease-and-desist declaration they send you.   The modified declaration basically states the following:    That you are not declaring yourself guilty That you do not accept the fine Despite the above you declare that in the future you will not download / share the files or videos mentioned in the letter in order to avoid a court case.    Though as mentioned there are various different modifactions and some are better than others.   Once you have sent them this declaration (best via registered mail so you can prove they received it), you can ignore future letters in this regard.

We're not looking to do the chromecast route or otherwise rely on a third device. Ideally, my wife can use the wireless keyboard, type the name of the show/movie and have it start playing.  I'll take a look around at alternatives, and I might look at the source code itself.   I did eventually find this feature request, so I cast my vote there.  https://popcorntime.uservoice.com/forums/245422-general/suggestions/5652902-webserver-mode"
PopCornTime,3chnoc,Kafke,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:47:47 2015 UTC,"IIRC, popcorn time already uses a web frontend (nodeJS?) as it initiates an instance of some version of google chrome. Perhaps look into that?  With a bit of coding and know how it shouldn't be too hard to switch it over. The backend is pretty much already there. It's all JS based, IIRC."
PopCornTime,3chnoc,sv244,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:52:12 2015 UTC,"I'll take a look.  I did some further searching and found yify-pop that is more in line with what I am looking for.  Before that, I found peerflix-server which is useful if you have known torrent/magnet link."

PopCornTime,3cfyfh,Luretrix2k,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:12:49 2015 UTC,So it is when you try to play an episode or movie?  Can you try to repick the popcorntime player in the players menu and try again.  And please report back.

PopCornTime,3cfyfh,tjayb87,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:42:00 2015 UTC,"Oh okay, thanks. I'm not sure what you mean by Vlc.. the drop down for ways to watch says popcorn time, chromecast, and then chromecast again with a diff icon by it. all three choices do the same thing..

And it should work to play it in an external player,what happens is that the experimental build tries to use a player that's no longer there.So try with an external player until the new streamer is released."

PopCornTime,3cd3b1,Luretrix2k,3,Mon Jul 6 23:50:27 2015 UTC,"This is indeed an issue. Popcorn time uses http://eztvapi.re/ as an API, which incorrectly grabs EZTV.ch uploads.  The issues seems to stem from a difference in naming. The stuff that appears in the api (and thus popcorn time) are named with this format:   Show S##E##   While the other uploads (that don't show up in either the api nor popcorn time) are:   Show #x##   This indeed seems to be a scraping problem. Since its was falsely assumed to be only the former format.  I'd go post this on the popcorn time forums. Seems like a legitimate problem that should be a 2-second fix."

Popcorntime.io (the one which this subreddit is for) is more or less the new official version. It retains the open source nature, continues on in the same fashion, and I think some devs are the same.  Popcorntime.se is another fork, which has remained largely closed source, has been known to have malicious software, and is generally pretty sketchy.  I'd stick with the .io one."

PopCornTime,3c9rqe,Houwert,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:20:34 2015 UTC,You know that this app will never be released on app store ? The only way to get the app will be if you iDevice is Jailbroken.
PopCornTime,3c9rqe,SyndromSnake,1 point,Mon Jul 6 11:45:21 2015 UTC,The .se version of Popcorn Time claims to have developed an installer than can bypass the apple check and install it on none jailbroken devices. They also said that the method will be used to install other applications for none jailbroken devices too. I can not verify these claims since I do not own an iOS device at the moment and neither do I use their application on my desktop PC.
PopCornTime,3c9rqe,Martanz,2,Mon Jul 6 12:06:46 2015 UTC,yeah they collaborated with iosinstaller.com. But all I here are people encountering problems during the installation proces.   We hope to distribute the same way as Moviebox. Using enterprise certificates. Since that's probably the only way to distribute in a practical manner.
PopCornTime,3c9rqe,Houwert,2,Mon Jul 6 12:09:49 2015 UTC,Apple will eventually patch out iosinstaller. There is no way they will let you install from any other source beside appstore.
PopCornTime,3c9rqe,SyndromSnake,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:44:29 2015 UTC,"Probably already patched it.  And nope, look at iOS 9 and XCode 7. You no longer need a dev account to build your own software and run it on your iDevice. So we can easily distribute to all of our PCT users with a Mac and iDevice."
PopCornTime,3c9rqe,Houwert,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:08:37 2015 UTC,"Oh really ? Thats awesome, that will make a ton of less ""legal"" apps available for ios. Which i find really strange since apple really likes to stay away from making it easier for people to install pirated content."
PopCornTime,3c9rqe,SyndromSnake,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:53:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah but they made it harder for people to learn how to develop apps for iDevices.   The only reason I was able to learn all of this was because of my jailbroken iPhone. I would've never paid 100 bucks up front for something that was back then just messing around.  Apple got their priorities straight, they are making it easier for children and schools to learn/teach. And that's more important then securing a profit."
PopCornTime,3c9rqe,Houwert,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:01:39 2015 UTC,Are you sure about that ? I am guessing they want to stay competetive with android by doing that. It has been a huge argument for a while now that android devices are better since they allow non curated software being installed.
PopCornTime,3c9rqe,SyndromSnake,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:20:07 2015 UTC,"They still do not directly allow non curated software to be installed. They just allow anyone to build and test their apps on their iDevice using XCode. ""Using XCode"" is the crucial part, you have to use their SDK to deploy the apps on the devices. This is not ment to compete with Android. They made the iPhone accept unsigned software, but they didn't add a new way to install apps.  If they wanted to compete they would've allowed user to install apps from other sources on the iDevice it self."
PopCornTime,3c9rqe,Houwert,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:22:57 2015 UTC,"Isn't accepting unsigned software the same as allowing people to install non curated software ? Of course this wont allow people to do it directly. But aslong as people can get fully working non curated apps on the phone, it will eventually lead to pirated content by for example making a custom installer."
PopCornTime,3c8864,sv244,9,Sun Jul 5 20:39:22 2015 UTC,Make the app work and they won't have to worry about people being fooled by the competition.  All I want to know is can I watch movies with the competition's product?

PopCornTime,3c8864,Luretrix2k,4,Mon Jul 6 15:54:06 2015 UTC,Exactly.....they fixed the movie section over a week ago in the experimental version of the app but for whatever reason they don't push the update to the beta one everyone has. Not everyone knows about the experimental version and they just assume the app stopped working and move on to another one. A important update like fixing the movie section needs to be pushed right away. Stupid decision like these are what make people move on to other movie apps.

This forum is for people who download their version from here popcorntime.io  So you need to check where you got it and ask them for help.

PopCornTime,3c2xms,wojx,2,Sun Jul 5 10:07:39 2015 UTC,Why not just download utorrent and go on pirate bay? The whole point of popcorn time was to not have to download movies before watching them
PopCornTime,3c2xms,Seansav,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:22:00 2015 UTC,utorrent has tonnes of ads and recently had a bitcoin miner hidden in it. Use deluge or transmission instead
PopCornTime,3c2xms,Not83,0,Mon Jul 6 01:17:00 2015 UTC,Just go to yts.re and download it with a torrent client. The whole point of popcorn Time is to stream torrents instead of downloading the. .

PopCornTime,3bxnud,tjayb87,34,Fri Jul 3 00:26:48 2015 UTC,"The problem is easy, but needs some background information.  You need to know that Popcorn Time uses Trakt (http://Trakt.TV) to get metadata about movies. Metadata is information like the covers, descriptions, background, release years etc.  Trakt migrated its servers around December when they launched their new website. They also released their new API v2, an API is a web service to get information.  On the 30th of June Trakt disabled APIv1. That's the API the desktop application of Popcorn Time uses. Thus the problem is simple: the service of Trakt is down thus Popcorn Time doesn't work.  The desktop developers are working on the issue and I think they'll have fixed this at the end of next week. Android is NOT affected by this, it already uses APIv2.  The experimental version of Popcorn Time works already, you can get it here: https://ci.popcorntime.io/  If you want to know more, then please check the forum: https://discuss.popcorntime.io/  More information about experimental builds: https://blog.popcorntime.io/experimental-builds/"

PopCornTime,3bxnud,speaks_in_subreddits,2,Fri Jul 3 13:00:54 2015 UTC,What's the difference between the expiremental version and the official version?
PopCornTime,3bxnud,MF_Doomed,2,Fri Jul 3 19:53:22 2015 UTC,"The experimental version is a pre-release version. It can contain bugs or features that will not make it into the release. But that doesn't mean it is bad. You just have a more up-to-date version, but it is not guaranteed that it will work.  The current experimental builds are stable. It's actually the version that will be shipped next week (kind of). The only problem is that we can't, because it uses a different version of the backend software. So we first need to update all current users to that new backend software version."
PopCornTime,3bxnud,sv244,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:35:11 2015 UTC,Experimental versions are usually a little buggy at the expense of getting updates earlier

PopCornTime,3bza3x,Ic3berg,2,Fri Jul 3 11:39:52 2015 UTC,.io seems to be more stable when chromecasting from an android phone.  .se keeps bugging on me...
PopCornTime,3bza3x,Kovalex27,2,Fri Jul 3 12:42:09 2015 UTC,"/r/popcorntime have always been very loyal when it comes to what version to pick, and that is the .io version. Even just writing about the .se version can get you downvotes. As a heavy consumer, this is what i've experienced with the two so far:  .io is great because its open source, easy to use and the app feels pretty stable. They offer a great selection of movies and the software runs smoothly. On Android, the UI is great but from what I've experienced, its also pretty buggy. The movies frequently lag on my One plus One, subtitles don't work and streaming can't find my chromecast for some reason.  .se is also great, because they offer the same features with access to a few more movies than .io (that being said, i should mention not all of the newer movies are FULL HD which is probably why .io doesn't offer them), and also, in my opinion, a MUCH more stable chromecast streaming service (i have not had one problem with it so far). They mainly offer more frequent updates than .io and have had Android/chromecast support for a much longer time (which means, less bugs). Bad thing is, the .se version is not open source wich means it could easily be loaded with some sort of unsafe software or adware. This is a pretty big deal on /r/popcorntime  For my conclusion, i personally prefer .se, since it offers a little bit more which i use a lot. I actually have them both installed, and i switch between them regularly, but .io has just not been able to live up to my needs."
PopCornTime,3bza3x,Rainbowscratch99,-2,Fri Jul 3 13:37:35 2015 UTC,If you look to the right on this subreddit you would see witch version is supported here.  Popcorntime.se also has a reddit /r/time4popcorn

PopCornTime,3bv05d,Askanner,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:49:39 2015 UTC,in most cases the ISP blocking the torrent site (YTS.re) where the movie list is loaded from. On macOsx go to popcorn time  the app and show the contents > Resources>app.nw>src>app> open settings.js. just change this line (should say .re change it to .im) : url: 'http://tv.ytspt.im/'  this works only of your ISP blocked the popular .re and not the .im domain of yts.  That worked for me!!  Edit: make sure to save the new settings.js
PopCornTime,3bxib9,BigTimpin,2,Thu Jul 2 23:38:44 2015 UTC,nwJsHelper.app is Popcorn Time's back end software. No problems.

PopCornTime,3bce3k,galapag0,15,Sat Jun 27 21:56:07 2015 UTC,We are the subreddit for the following version: https://popcorntime.io
PopCornTime,3bce3k,Wodashit,9,Sat Jun 27 22:15:12 2015 UTC,"I know, but i just wanted to make other users aware of the fact that it is loading an unencrypted website (sadly, most of them don't care)."
PopCornTime,3bce3k,for_ffxiv_sake,2,Sat Jun 27 22:23:48 2015 UTC,So does it matter if you're on a VPN?
PopCornTime,3bce3k,the_isra17,2,Sun Jun 28 02:54:40 2015 UTC,"Well, your VPN provider would able to see what's going on, or some MITM between it and the server. But for the most likely scenario, (ISP or firewall MITM between you and the server) it won't matter because of your VPN.  However all this doesn't matter since browsing website is legal. As long as there are no authentication, HTTP is no big deal. It is the torrenting part that is illegal and at that point you NEED a VPN."
PopCornTime,3bce3k,Wodashit,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:22:08 2015 UTC,"All right, sorry, did not understand the intent."

PopCornTime,3bce3k,Houwert,2,Sat Jun 27 23:45:05 2015 UTC,Are you sure their current version still does this?  I looked into the html and their google analytics is still for their old domain.  And if you go to desktop.popcorn-time.se you get the desktop version. But that version has multiple links to their old domain too. (All of them are methods to track their users activity)
PopCornTime,3bce3k,Houwert,2,Sun Jun 28 00:46:12 2015 UTC,"Yes, since I unpacked the ipa of the last iOS version downloaded from popcorn-time.se."

PopCornTime,3b2l7b,TxksDQZN,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:56:12 2015 UTC,There are not enough seeds for the episodes you are trying to watch. Just grab the torrent file off of a tracker and do it the way we did before popcorn time
PopCornTime,3b2l7b,TunaLobster,2,Fri Jun 26 10:56:20 2015 UTC,You can also stream from torrents.  Just Copy/Paste the link from torrent-site-of-your-choice.com into PopcornTime and chose the file you want to stream.

PopCornTime,3aq4ls,BADWOLF317,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:54:42 2015 UTC,"It's actually either a seeding issue (not enough seeders for the file you're trying to watch) or an internet connection issue (maybe you're downloading other stuff or just don't have enough bandwidth to stream an HD file).

I pay for the one I use (PIA) and am happy with their service

PopCornTime,3aedz9,Mysticpoisen,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:40:36 2015 UTC,"I'm not the person to talk to about VPNs, though PIA is very good. I can explain how the CAS system works. You aren't flagged, and you weren't sent a message because Verizon is watching you, though I'm sure they are. The CAS is a system that says ""If you find one of out users pirating your stuff, tell us, and we'll send them a letter"" so basically some companies will sit on the torrents, and due to the P2P nature of bittorrent, they can see all the IPs in the swarm. They send them all to the big ISPs, they look and see if any IPs match with the ones their users had at the time, and they send you a letter.

I have gotten DMCA notices from True Detective and I've heard a ton of stories about HBO shows in general getting people busted.   So, I think unless you're watching one of their products, you shouldn't need to worry too much. Is it worth paying for a VPN just for one show? If so, again, Private Internet Access is a good one. If not, then maybe you should look into private trackers.   HBO seem to take piracy especially seriously. Especially now that they are releasing their online service which gives people less of an excuse for pirating, in their eyes."
PopCornTime,3a3ar9,seedari,2,Wed Jun 17 03:44:28 2015 UTC,What do you usually do when you get a dmca notice? I use a vpn so hopefully I never get one but what has been your experience with them?
PopCornTime,3a3ar9,seedari,3,Wed Jun 17 04:00:30 2015 UTC,"Do you mean what were the circumstances/what did I do to GET the notice? (downloaded too many HBO episodes on a public tracker with no VPN) or what did I do after getting it? If the latter, I did nothing more than use private trackers more often and got a PIA subscription - I carried on with my life and was more careful.  It's just a warning about copyright violation. They ask you not to do it anymore and threaten action in the future if it continues. I live in the US and my ISP is one of the biggest/shittiest in the country (hint: ""it's shittastic!"") I believe in this country we have a nearly universal ""6 strikes"" rule across major ISPs. This means that you have 6 notices before the ISP can/will actually take action. Actions being suspension of service, canceling your service, or a fine - I'm really not sure what they usually do. That's a lot of chances to fuck up.  They tend to not want to lose customers so I think just a minor punishment would happen. They want to keep making that huge profit off the customer and canceling service ruins that.   I just looked it up and the official policy name is the Copyright Alert System.   Here is one more great link (from torrentfreak) which breaks down how it works and what the punishment measures can be."

Most likely is what the TF article says, ""A more likely punishment is a throttled connection, where connection speeds are severely degraded for a set period."" And that's all AFTER 6 warnings. If someone can't get their shit together and get a VPN after 5 strikes, then maybe they shouldn't be pirating haha"

I have already checked the firewall settings and even rebooted the router just in case.  Since other programs on the same machine and with the same network architecture are able to stream content, it leads me to believe that the problem lies with the Popcorn Time program itself.

If you still don't want to listen to the advice given (GET A VPN) by everyone on this sub, you can change the TV Show API Endpoint in the advanced settings.   I just tried    http://br.api.ptn.pm/    and it works. I'm not sure if there's supposed to be a speed decrease if you're going through another country's endpoint, but I just checked a 720p Game of Thrones episode, and it was downloading at 5.5 MB/s. Since the french version (fr.api.ptn.pm) has already been blocked by VM, this is likely to be a short-term solution."

PopCornTime,384ch8,AllBetsOnJames,5,Mon Jun 1 23:06:08 2015 UTC,I never get what the end-users expect/want.  Please answer this:   1)Do you wish to stream games instead of fully downloading them?  2) Do you want a curated list of cracked games?  3) Is there no problems in not including multiplayer games?  4) Is one-click install a must-have?
PopCornTime,384ch8,Killerko,7,Tue Jun 2 00:51:46 2015 UTC,"actually.. it's not a bad idea. less techie people could install cracked games without the worry of fakes and viruses.  It does not have to stream games or any other nonsense.. just to install/uninstall some kind of ""verified"" cracked releases.. something like steam does.  And if the software would offer a nice user friendly interface there could be a use for it."
PopCornTime,384ch8,Yasuragi,3,Tue Jun 2 01:21:35 2015 UTC,Agreed. Would also make it easier to organize cracked multiplayer.
PopCornTime,384ch8,scottbrio,7,Tue Jun 2 01:24:36 2015 UTC,"I'm going to start off by saying I love this idea in theory. If it can be what popcorn time is to movies, I'm all in. I'm also going to give some harsh constructive criticism.   The GUI is decent. A bit rough around the edges but ok for a start. One inherent problem is that a lot of torrent files don't have album covers. This is what makes the strict admission rules to iTunes great- an album cover %100 of the time.   I've clicked play on one file and it's been spinning for as long as I've been typing. Only one song came up under my desired search.   I'd also suspect that, unlike the movie industry, most people who listen to music are ok with 128kbps, which is how many of the torrent files are, meaning you have to wade through BS to find that one rare copy of ""whatever-song"". People ALWAYS want the highest quality movie, not so with music unfortunately. If the program could have a filter for 320 or higher files, that might work. Still no music on the file I clicked play on...   Not sure if you're the dev or just a random. Either way, if this gets some serious refinement you'll have my attention. Until then I'll be listening to iTunes Radio/Pandora/Google Play :)"
PopCornTime,384ch8,scottbrio,3,Mon Jun 1 20:42:19 2015 UTC,"I personally have not tested it, as im not a big music person, but the comunity has been asking for this for quite a while and the developer posted this in the PT forums. This is, so far, the only one that used torrents as the medium to download and share the files, and that is why I shared it. As I mentioned, /u/CactusPlayer is the main developer."

PopCornTime,384ch8,scottbrio,4,Mon Jun 1 21:25:23 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much for your reply.  I'm the original developer of the Cactus Player. As to respond to some of your concerns:  -> The album covers are loaded from the internet using the DuckDuckGo image search. This system is correct 95% of the time. I'm in the process of adding a separate album cover loading system that uses the MusicBrainz API.  Both of these are of course not perfect systems. Covers are not saved on Server nodes themselves because it would greatly increase the amount of storage space needed. The data the servers need to run is kept as small as possible, making it possible to run copies on free or cheap web hosts without needing to worry about bandwidth or storage space. Anyone should be able to even run a server on their toaster, basically (-: .  The current library is small as there are not that many users yet. Many of the current albums have been loaded from an old torrent database. It is possible for any user to add an album they like, as long as it already exists somewhere on the internet as a torrent file.  Search results are ordered on playability, the songs that have been able to be successfully played more often ranked higher, ensuring that songs that do work and have decent quality rise to the top.  Your idea to keep track of and filter for better quality versions is a smart one. I'm not sure how easy it will be to implement this in practice, but I will look into it."

It's 2015, so the ""this group doesn't publish stuff in 720p"" sounds like a really hollow explanation. I remember starting to watch EVERYthing in 720p back when Lost Season 1 came on.  What I do is look for ""showsname s01e01 720p"" on torrentz.eu and then just paste the magnet url into the client, but that takes it a far cry away from being a Netflix killer.  The problem with old episodes is in my mind that the amount of seeders is so small, that I can't get above 250k/s. And I'm running it over VPN, so as far as I can understand, there should be no problem with port access. A good example is the series ""Dig"".

PopCornTime,37bryl,egzon27,1 point,Tue May 26 16:02:31 2015 UTC,"After some extensive searching, as I understand PopCorn Time uses EZTV API for tv shows. Any idea if there is any other API better than EZTV?   On the other hand, I installed one plugin for Kodi that was suggested in another top thread here (apparently it also uses EZTV) and the shows episodes are there.  Something weird is going on and I cannot seem to understand it."
PopCornTime,37bryl,egzon27,2,Tue May 26 16:32:41 2015 UTC,"Get Kodi,get Genesis way better imo  As for popcorn there is ettv which is somewhat better I guess and last time I heard eztv was shut down"

PopCornTime,37arpf,bzebuth,2,Wed May 27 01:52:52 2015 UTC,I think what you are looking for is is the genesis addon.
PopCornTime,378m8j,MannerShark,7,Mon May 25 19:41:00 2015 UTC,What I think is happening is that popcorn time is attempting to download the movie in sequential chunks so you can watch the movie while it is downloading. Normal torrent programs just download the most available chunk of the file (most likely out of order) which allows for quicker downloading but is bad for immediate viewing.
PopCornTime,378m8j,yellow_post-it,3,Mon May 25 21:41:14 2015 UTC,"No I use sequential downloading in my client as well, so that should be mostly the same. Maybe qBT has some extra functionality to get a n chunk window going so it doesn't have to wait for each chunk. Still, I'm also losing peers, so that can't explain it."
PopCornTime,378m8j,aynrandomness,8,Mon May 25 21:51:58 2015 UTC,They use a shitty torrent client because they refuse to use libtorrent. It is really dumb.
PopCornTime,378m8j,crapsuit,3,Tue May 26 10:32:01 2015 UTC,Same here. Number of seeders also drops dramatically in PT but stays cool in qBittorrent.

Make sure you do the reinstall with the installer from https://popcorntime.io  If non of this works it's probably the nearest Voodoo Shaman that has cursed you to a life of SD."

But nevertheless, i appreciate your work, if possible automate the process of downloading the movies, so that it will be faster to watch new ones."
PopCornTime,36n2j5,zewt,2,Sat Jun 27 09:51:04 2015 UTC,"Just an FYI, but direct linking to any content from BrowserPopcorn servers is in violation of the T.O.S. Please don't do that. Basically, torrent streaming on demand is very wasteful, since you download the movie every time a user wants to watch it. I have developed the technology for that, which was available at MovBucket.com. However, in the end, I decided that storing movies is much more efficient than downloading them every time a user requests them. The downloading is automated, but requesting new movies isn't. In the orchestrator panel I can request a given torrent to be downloaded, it will be added to the queue and when it's turn is to be downloaded, a torrent-stream instance will be spawned and will start downloading the torrent. When it's downloaded, the node script will move the file to the correct directory and call a PHP script which will update the main database and escalate the changes to all the proxy and cache servers. The servers will then each request a file from the main storage server and cache it to their own HDD. Those are the cdn-ps-1 and cdn-ps-2 servers. The main server is unspecified and secret.

It turned into one of the most visited torrent sites, but today this run comes to an end.  Other torrent sites such as KickassTorrents, BT-chat and Rarbg have also disabled or suspended the official EZTV accounts after hearing about the takeover. In addition, KickassTorrents and BT-chat have added the same warning as TPB. This way they hope to keep people away from the compromised EZTV site, which is now serving various ads including pop-unders.  Former EZTV staffers also urge people to stay away from all EZTV sites and to inform others to do the same. The real EZTV is no longer active.  EZTV’s forced retirement marks the and of an era.

PopCornTime,36ewhn,pepijn809,1 point,Wed May 20 19:28:13 2015 UTC,"I guess that's true for most movie/tv fans. But i think the companies and their own thought rules and so called ""laws"" make it hard to make this a reality.   If they tried however. I just read Netflix wants to do more with P2P,which is good. In theory you could easily set up a service like Netflix P2P, kinda a Popcorn Time on subscription based or pay per film. But the amount of money required for it, would be a lot smaller. Due to the small amount of server fees.   The Company or Organisation behind this only needs to protect the trackers somehow, from non subscribers getting access. But if all of that could be done, they could get a service cheaply, build for consumers, easily able to tell what is popular due seeders etc.   Other Companies could even add their own trackers to the app, so that there could be a larger collection for a higher fee. I mean, honestly, if that would feature like a nice chunk of the most popular shows at Popcorn Time, i would definitly and gladly pay a maximum of €15 bucks each month. But i think due to P2P,it could be cheaper even.   Anyway, just hope to see somebody do this. And create the first legal platform p2p based for film content.   Imagine what this could do for struggling film makers in Bollywood! It would also prioritize things to real popularity.   Let's hope."

I can't quite see it as a Netflix replacement yet but, maybe.  The great thing about Netflix is recommendations and not having to count on seeds.  Bad thing is Netflix content can be highly restricted.  I'm not in the US so I gotta use a damn VPN to even get the service. :-/"
PopCornTime,36hddf,Houwert,1 point,Wed May 20 21:19:27 2015 UTC,"Same here, I like the concept of netflix. Had it for a couple of months but this resulted in me downloading more than ever. There're just too many restrictions.   It takes way too long for a movie/show to be available through Netflix. And half of the movies I wanted to see were ""dvd only"". So I had to pay double if I wanted to see those.  And yeah, Popcorn Time isn't as easy and intuitive as Netflix's algorithms. But it's the best we got. Maybe with the release of 0.4.0 someone makes a plugin which tracks your tv shows and gives recommendations.  And as far the lack of seeds for some shows goes, using bittorrent is the only save option. Popcorn Time started as a bittorrent streamer. And it's practically impossible to host all of the content on a centralized server. It will be taken down almost immediately and it will be too large to move easily.  You can always search the pirate bay or kickass torrents if there're any torrents with more seeds and 'drag and drop' those inside Popcorn Time. It will then stream that torrent for you.  If you ever have any other questions I recommend checking out https://discuss.popcorntime.io. This is our forum filled with experienced users and the rest of our dev team."

They don't use it for torrenting, but they do use it to talk to blocked public trackers and rss feeds as well as hidden trackers. (I'm not sure, but I think they just run it in single hop anti censorship mode and not in full blown multi-hop mode. This way talking to the trackers is faster than configuring your own proxy/vpn for trackers.) https://www.vuze.com/plugins/details/aznettor  They also have an I2P plugin, but that's for hidden trackers and not censored public trackers.

Someone can seed the download and not have it completed, which can limit how fast you download it as well, since they may be at a lower percentage than you.. Basically the likelihood of those 3 peers all having it finished and uploading is low, compared to GoT. That being said, yes, more peers[specifically seeders] means better download speed, but it is all dependent on the individuals upload speed. There may be 100seeders with 10kb/s but 1 seeder with 1mb/s will be stronger than those combined. As simple as I can describe seeds and peers. It goes deeper when you talk about leechers(you).

PopCornTime,36c0fl,itsnotmyredditname,10,Mon May 18 06:05:26 2015 UTC,The music industry has actually given us enough affordable alternatives that pirating seems pointless to me.
PopCornTime,36c0fl,SSwifty,3,Mon May 18 07:20:09 2015 UTC,Havent Pirated a song since getting spotify and i could never go back. So easy to manage thousands of songs and the rmeote play + playlists syncing on all my devices and being able to drag a local track to my pc and have it on my phone and ipad is great
PopCornTime,36c0fl,Dinklebop,-1,Mon May 18 09:59:17 2015 UTC,"Likewise, all my music used to be pirated, but Spotify just makes things so much easier that it's just not worth the time and effort to find each song/album that I like, instead do a quick search on Spotify and add to playlist, works great.  Plus it's a decent way to find some new music."
PopCornTime,36c0fl,Alexc26,1 point,Mon May 18 10:40:57 2015 UTC,"Yup. I can be watching a movie and hear a song and think ""man i want to listen to that whole thing"" Jump on my phone grab the whole album and its there on my pc when i get home to play some video games and listen to music."

PopCornTime,36c0fl,SSwifty,1 point,Mon May 18 16:30:13 2015 UTC,Agreed. Paid for Spotify for a year or so and recently switched to Google's All Access and I just can't imagine having to go back to hunting down torrents/usenet files for music. $10 a month is ridiculously cheap to be legal and the ease of use.
PopCornTime,36c0fl,McMurphyCrazy,1 point,Mon May 18 13:24:41 2015 UTC,"I made the jump from Spotify free to Google All Access and have to say I can't imagine obtaining my music any other way now.

I would say its exactly like a torrent client, so im sure while we are using it it seeds the cache that it creates for sure. Not sure though."
PopCornTime,3672ze,_NKh_,2,Sun May 17 00:39:32 2015 UTC,The movie is seeding the entire time PT is open. Close it when you're done and it'll delete the files and stop seeding.  It is on your computer. It downloads it in a watchable order via torrents. It downloads faster than you watch it thus the reason this works.  PopCornTime.io does not include any malware of any type. Other versions (forks) have issues but the only one we talk about on this subreddit is the official version.
PopCornTime,3672ze,savesheep,1 point,Sun May 17 00:52:57 2015 UTC,What is http://popcorn-time.se/ ?? The website content is different than https://popcorntime.io/
PopCornTime,3672ze,_NKh_,1 point,Sun May 17 01:06:59 2015 UTC,"A different version of popcorn time. Popcorn time is open source, so when the original organization went down, a bunch of people jumped on, and copied it to make their own, and keep popcorn time going.  That being said, these two versions have separated, and popcorntime.io has the best reputation. Other versions have started to bundle adware and spyware into their versions."

I have plex and prefer running that with a remote (on mac). Do they have in plans to make a UI like that, or ever to integrate with Plex or XBMC/Kodi ?"
PopCornTime,3672ze,_NKh_,1 point,Sun May 17 22:06:40 2015 UTC,"AFAIK it's the same as using a torrent client except it's hidden from you so it downloads, seeds, and removes automatically.   The IO version should not have malware however I also feel like it slows my computer a bit but I don't know why except maybe it's in beta so not fully optimized."

PopCornTime,361tb6,Houwert,1 point,Sat May 16 12:59:06 2015 UTC,They can't block the yts api since it's behind cloudflare.   We access eztvapi.re directly so the block is effective.   They never blocked Anime since it's hollywood who's greedy and wants to block better working alternatives then their own services. Hollywood doesn't produce anime so they aren't after the anime api we use.

PopCornTime,362o4t,HeyYouNow,8,Fri May 15 16:26:18 2015 UTC,"Nah it's not abandoned, there is just a non-friendly competition between the two projects, so how about focusing on helping you with your question. As a matter of fact I wondered the exact same thing so I gave it a go earlier this morning.  They are using a completely new tool to install on non jailbroken devices, something ios users have been waiting since the very first iphone. The guys over at Torrent Freak apparently tested it reported the new installer working like a charm, although imo it's a little too soon for me to test it (it is not even released, the devs built it only to work for Popcorn time).I personnaly installed it through cydia.  So what does it means ? Apple built a lot of restrictions on their os, specifically users are normally not able to install non-signed-by-apple applications. What it also means is : any application installed absolutely can not interfere with anything outside of the app. So regardless of the way you install it, it's completely safe. This is just the way it works on ios.  Anyway the app is working perfectly fine on my iphone 4, you can expect the exact same results as in you were on pc. The player is actually not the same as the ios-wide one, I'm guessing it is because you can choose subtitles on the go while watching. So yeah pretty much the same thing as you already have, except working on ios."
PopCornTime,362o4t,solwGer,2,Sat May 16 10:53:11 2015 UTC,"I personnaly installed it through cydia.   I'm jailbroken on iPhone 5, iOS 8.1.2 myself.  Mind giving me the repo? I tried downloading ""Popcorn Time"" from the repo ""http://cydia.popcorn-time.se/"" and when I try to open the app, it just black screens for a second and then switches back to the homescreen. Appsync is installed, and other third party apps (GBA4IOS, NDS4IOS, play box HD, vshare) work like a charm.   Any help / advice is greatly appreciated."

PopCornTime,35xukj,Campers,3,Fri May 15 08:20:06 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure it appears within the app when it is released and tells you that it'll update when it restarts. Either that or use ZenMate chrome extension to get on the website to download it.

After you log in while on Wi-Fi go to any IP lookup site and look at the IP, then disable PIA and refresh the page and it will show your true IP if you want to make sure it it working. Now this does not apply to Chrome cast, even if you have PIA on your phone and cast Popcorn Time the chrome cast will still be doing the work leaving you unprotected.

PopCornTime,35r7iu,mikeg3095,2,Tue May 12 21:03:38 2015 UTC,I personally dropped popcorn time for streaming from macbook to chromecast . It worked decently at one point but seems to have fallen apart. I have switched to just using www.movietv.to and sending it to chromecast (using PIA as a VPN in a chrome tab). I'll come back to popcorntime when it matures a bit. For now this works for me.

PopCornTime,35fyz1,GarageMc,3,Sat May 9 23:55:12 2015 UTC,The magic is called DLNA. Specifically your TV is advertising itself as a DMR (Digital Media Renderer) on your network and Popcorn Time is acting as a DMS (Digital Media Server) which is discovering and then pushing the video stream to your TV.
PopCornTime,35fyz1,ellisgeek,1 point,Sun May 10 00:17:47 2015 UTC,"I see thanks. Are there any apps that use dlna to let me ""push"" content onto my tv the way popcorn time does?"

PopCornTime,357j6g,SnowGabe,4,Thu May 7 19:28:18 2015 UTC,"Just as aegarn mentioned, you can paste or drop any torrent/magnet url in to the client to start streaming it. The torrents inside the client that gets downloaded at the moment are YIFY releases only. Those movies have codecs to minimize the size.   When the next version of popcorn time (0.4.0) gets released there will be support for plugins. This means that you no longer be forced to view YIFY torrents inside the client.  Here's a quote from the latest blog post   Plugin System  This allows developers and other content providers to create ""packages"" to add new features, movies and metadata to Popcorn Time. Example packages would be the metadata provider for Trakt.tv, The movie provider YTS, and the show provider EZTV. All plugins will be installable from a clean interface inside the app.  Other changes  Along with a new plugin system comes a new list of content for the application. Right now when you load Popcorn Time you see YTS movies and EZTV shows, however in the future with 0.4.0 you will instead be greeted with various copyleft content avaliable for all to enjoy, and providers like YTS and EZTV will require the user to install manually on first launch to help with legal issues."

And that's what happens when you're streaming a movie/tv show episode using Popcorn Time. So actually using the core functionality of Popcorn Time could be illegal in your country.  It all depends on your local laws and if it's actually actively enforced.

If it did, it would only effect the areas where that law was out in place.  The USA couldn't force Canadian VPNs for example to keep logs.    As for the downloads, they are not performing them.  They are routing them.  It would be like holding your ISP accountable for your actions.  A VPN just provides a secure route between two points.   The VPNs that we are using for downloads are VPNs plus proxy.  So you are securely connected to a server, that server then routes you to the net.   Remember: there are a lot of ways other than your IP address to identify you."
PopCornTime,350wh5,chmbrs,1 point,Wed May 6 04:48:48 2015 UTC,"But, if data is going from a torrent to the VPN, then to you, technically the VPN is indeed downloading the data, even if its just passing the data along to you.  Correct?  (I ask, because Im genuinely not sure)     It would be like holding your ISP accountable for your actions   I think the difference would be that the ISP does have a responsibility to answer to law enforcement regarding subpeonas, etc, correct?  And they do log, correct?  While I think for now VPNs are a secure way to do this, I do think in time that may change.  It wouldnt be terribly difficult for world governments to work together to enforce VPN logging across borders and placing sanctions on countries who would not.    But then again, in doing so they might shoot themselves in the foot when it comes to counter-terrorism and such.  They too need a way to be anonymous on the internet, I would imagine."
PopCornTime,350wh5,chmbrs,2,Wed May 6 05:05:45 2015 UTC,"It's not downloading, only passing through.  Your data hits a lot of places before getting to you.    In DOS type tracert and a website.

The thing I maybe did not explain well is that the Chromecast features seems to not always work properly for example it doesn't allow casting 720p shows, switching subtitles while watching, and on the latest versions (at least for me), it doesn't work at all anymore : I get the loading screen on the TV and the ""play pause, stop,...."" screen on PT but it stays stuck this way and I have to close the program.  That's why I tried videostream along with PT and found it worked perfectly and so I wondered why it didn't work as well natively.

I'm the only one that needs it.  ANY AND ALL torrents are NEVER active unless the VPN is on. sometimes, a torrent app (not popcorn time) may be active after I put the computer in hibernation mode, but there are are NO ACTIVE TORRENTS, and I shut it down and start it up again under the VPN to ensure no leaks take place.  I've been pretty paranoid about security lately -- I dont know if anyone cares where I am, but my ISP (time warner) definitely does -- though I have never gotten any notices.  Id just like to prevent it from EVER happening, so I got the VPN account, and Ive kinda gone crazy with it -- I just kinda feel like I shouldnt have increased my torrent usage 900% since I got it, nothing is perfect, and I KNOW the VPN address has been logged far more times than my actual IP (probably only logged by torrent/internet researchers).

PopCornTime,342t44,doodledee123,5,Mon Apr 27 21:27:26 2015 UTC,"It's just as illegal, but the chance of getting caught is much smaller in Showbox because the videos are hosted on innocent sites like vk.com and mail.ru. And yes, you are technically downlading the movies, but they will disappear."
PopCornTime,342t44,HJGamer,1 point,Tue Apr 28 06:28:13 2015 UTC,"Showbox is closed source, so we have no way of knowing how safe it is, nor can we be completely sure how it works. Popcorn time is open source, so people can verify it's safe to use and isn't up to any tricks."
PopCornTime,342t44,sloppychris,1 point,Wed Jun 3 06:54:26 2015 UTC,"alright so showbox doesn't work on my mac lol, do you guys know any other programs like popcorn time but doesn't require you to temporarily download the movies?"
PopCornTime,342t44,Jynweythek501,-6,Thu Apr 30 02:42:58 2015 UTC,"I assume you're talking about the Android app.  No, both work essentially the same way. Both stream from torrents. If anything, Show Box is closer to the illegal side of things, as it allows you to download movies and TV shows to storage to watch later, unlike Popcorn Time, which only streams, and makes sure to clear the cache of any downloaded files when closed."
PopCornTime,342t44,defaultfresh,6,Tue Apr 28 01:04:06 2015 UTC,"Actually ShowBox uses a video host website, not torrents from peer to peer. That's why it's slow and popcorn time is so fast."
PopCornTime,342t44,Jynweythek501,2,Tue Apr 28 01:22:42 2015 UTC,"Huh. Looks like you're right. Ran a download, and Show Box is only connecting to 5 IPs, and none of them seem like Peers. Most of them are in Russia, which would explain the speed.  I'm honestly surprised an app like Show Box, with its gray legality and the fact that it was removed from the Play Store, had the resources to stream Full HD movies from dedicated servers."
PopCornTime,342t44,defaultfresh,3,Tue Apr 28 01:47:42 2015 UTC,"Well They're not dedicated to showbox, showbox just uses them."
PopCornTime,342t44,HJGamer,1 point,Tue Apr 28 06:08:45 2015 UTC,That has nothing to do with speed. It all depends on the speed between host and client. One is not faster than the other.

PopCornTime,330ugu,rsaborio,-1,Sat Apr 18 23:35:04 2015 UTC,"Open Souce software like PopcornTime encourages the creation of forks. I don't care about your simple opinion about what a fork should offer and if it's not better etc.     People build stuff, just because they want to. If you don't like it, just don't use their software.    On Popcorn Time so far, with the new team it's been a blast. Real amazing developers have come and some have gone already. It's a great project.    However any of the times something was suggested outside the scope of their likings, they responded with ""Well just fork it and build your own"". I don't know why this guy is building it and why in C#. But i encourage it, even if it isn't better.     Maybe just maybe, it's suited for different needs and a different audience. Or perhaps it's just the perfect Popcorn Time fork accoding to that Creator.    Ether way, just stop. It's quite useless to discuss the necesitty when you don't wanna see other reason apart from the fact that you simply think it's all about being better than the status quo.    A little note for you, PopcornTime.io didn't just fall here, it was a long road. I can tell you, because i was there before it all blew up with newspapers. I know how some things started out.

If the answer is because ""I was bored and I wanted to program C#"" then it's a valid answer but don't give me that shitty speech about what should I say or not. Its a simple question that all developers must answer if they want people to use their products. People need to know why this instead of the other but it seems you don't understand that.

PopCornTime,32m32x,sondo8,2,Thu Apr 16 19:21:18 2015 UTC,Presumably this advice is for Windows users. If you have a Mac you can stream anything directly from your computer to the Apple TV.

PopCornTime,32m32x,vindvott,2,Thu May 7 12:57:36 2015 UTC,What do you mean by lag? Audio and video out of sync? Video buffering/stalling? Latency when projecting a game or your computer's desktop?
PopCornTime,32m32x,freediverx01,1 point,Fri May 8 17:15:29 2015 UTC,"There is a delay/lagg when ""streaming"" my screen on airplay. Only occours when I mirror the screen though, there is no lagg when I play something on airplay through an app like beamer or popcorntime. My computer is completely fine, but the image on my screen still laggs. Both sound and video."
PopCornTime,32m32x,vindvott,2,Fri May 8 21:12:41 2015 UTC,"This is to be expected since wifi and bluetooth are nowhere near as fast as a hard link like an HDMI connection. Some software is smart enough to automatically compensate for this, ensuring that at least your audio and video will be in sync. This works for pre-recorded content like movies, but not so much for anything that is interactive, like a game or mirrored view of your desktop.  So if direct Airplay support is broken on PopcornTime, when you try to mirror instead, are the audio and video out of sync on your TV, or just out of sync between the TV and your computer? If it's the latter, it shouldn't really matter since presumably you should al==only be watching and listening to the content on the TV."
PopCornTime,32m32x,freediverx01,1 point,Sat May 9 12:21:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks for replying!  It's not out of sync, it kind of just stops for a second, then it continues to where my computer is at. So every 3 seconds I lose 1 second. Hard to explain when I don't know the right termonology. But I've heard it's a known issue for almost everyone with a MacBook using airplay, so I guess it won't be fixed until the new appletv comes out."
PopCornTime,32m32x,vindvott,1 point,Sat May 9 12:25:56 2015 UTC,"Got it. Sounds like you have a buffering issue. Let me try to give you an overview based on what I know.   When you stream video from your computer to your Apple TV over wifi, the signal goes from your computer, to your wifi router, and finally to your Apple TV. The Apple TV saves several seconds of the video to memory (the buffer) before it starts playing it. This is done to make playback nice and smooth and compensate for any minor hiccups in the speed at which the video is streamed.  If the video plays fine on your computer, but stops and starts when sending via AirPlay (commonly referred to as a buffering issue) it generally means that the connection is too slow between your Apple TV and your router, the router and your computer, or both.  Reasons why your wifi might be too slow:  1) You or someone else in your home are trying to use AirPlay at the same time you are transferring lots of data over your wifi network (downloading or streaming video or large files.) If you're maxing out your wifi connection doing something else, this will interfere with your ability to use it for AirPlay streaming.  2) You have a weak wifi signal between your Apple TV and your wifi router and/or between your wifi router and your computer. This can be caused by the devices being too far away from each other, blocked by walls, or by interference from some microwave ovens or wireless telephones.  3) One or more of the devices in question might have older, slower wifi technology. Whichever device has the slowest tech becomes the bottleneck in the system and will slow down everything else. The most common home wifi standards, from fastest to slowest, are: 802.11ac, 802.11n, 802.11g, and 802.11b. If your slowest device uses ""g"" or ""b"", that may be the issue.  An added note: If you're using AirPlay to mirror video that's playing in PopcornTime, that means your wifi network is simultaneously carrying both the video from your computer to your Apple TV AND the video from the internet to your computer. In this scenario, having the fastest possible internet connection and wifi are especially important."

If you use a US server, they'll typically warn you after X amount of copyright claims and depending on the service they might terminate your account if you get a high number of claims, but you can always make another account.

PopCornTime,32hkdr,HeyWheresKel,3,Mon Apr 13 21:22:28 2015 UTC,"Hi I'll be glad to answer your questions.   Popcorn Time is NOT a website. It's an application written in web languages but it still works as a standalone application. Uninstalling the app without any traces is easy. But be sure to use a VPN if you want to be sure your ISP has no traces of you using Popcorn Time too. It will probably not make a difference, but if you really want to you can just do it anyway.  It's not illegal downloading Popcorn Time. But it's illegal (in some countries) to download movies and tv shows. Which is the core functionality of Popcorn Time. So you can just download Popcorn Time using Chrome. But be sure to use a VPN if it's illegal to download movies etc in your country."

PopCornTime,32hkdr,red_3y3s,0,Mon Apr 13 22:07:35 2015 UTC,"Hello there! Just started using Popcorn Time recently.   1) The program collects all the data and presents in a way that's user friendly. I'm sure they could do it with a website but there are probably legal ramifications for it.  2) You have the program to now search/watch/download movies, and yes.  3)You don't need to VPN to download the program, the program isn't illegal. Depending on your location, downloading them (movies & shows) is what is illegal. Use a VPN while viewing the movies in Popcorn Time. I know Popcorn Time has a built in one that you can pay for (pretty cheap) but I use another VPN for my own reasons.  Hope that helped!"

PopCornTime,32hkdr,brickfrog2,1 point,Mon Apr 13 22:08:50 2015 UTC,Popcorn Time as a website will be quite hard. I think it's currently still impossible to use the bittorrent protocol in a web browser.   And the servers and domain will be taken down immediately.
PopCornTime,32hkdr,Houwert,1 point,Mon Apr 13 21:48:17 2015 UTC,"Not impossible, there are forks that do this.   Yify-Pop does this & runs/saves the torrents server-side, similar to what joker.org used to do. Webflix.me (aka popcornexpress) also streams through the browser, but it uses a browser plugin so the torrents are still being run client-side like the normal PT application.   There might be others, just the ones I heard of offhand.   And the servers and domain will be taken down immediately.

But you are watching what someone else made, without paying them for it.   It's a choice to not pay, and watch freely. It's again a choice to take a vpn.     Dont get me wrong. I have a vpn myself, a serious amount of content to on hdd. Which is of course pirated, since legal services rarely let you download at all (mostly drm) but, i do have a Netflix subscription, thought about Amazon, maybe Hulu, but im in the Netherlands, so not sure. I find the prices online for buying or renting a movie to stream, rediculus. But i do buy ""psysical releases"" (bluray only) from time to time. I see them as expensive, and maybe not useful in 10 years (due limitations of bluray) but i do like to collect them, im a fan of most that i buy, watch the sales regularely to snoop deals. Like this: Fight Club + Inception + Pulp Fiction for 14,99,which is reasonable. Thats prices i look for.     I hope to see a change, definitly in streaming. But i would love a 8,00 to 10,00 release price for psysical release and going down with years or months of release combined with rating etc.    What if we consumers could decide a part of the price, like the Humble Bundles. That would make profit, and still be interesting for customers to. Win win, but you know. They aint getting it, im a pirate, always will be. Cause i can watch a whole lot, their price is what determines how often i need to be a pirate. Cause i honestly would pay, how crazy some may find that. I see it as products, which need to be cheaper, but not free or like cent cheap.    Anyway, for people not understanding this, that it needs to cost something. I say this, you are the worst kind of pirate, i hope you sail far away, cause you're not a movie/serie/anime fan at all. If you're not understanding the fact that everyone involved in the making of something, do need a pay check. Im not talking about the fat cows at the top, no at the ordinary joe.     Thanks"

PopCornTime,3206o6,eNaRDe,1 point,Thu Apr 9 15:57:07 2015 UTC,I been hearing allot about the IOS version (which isnt support by the real popcorn time) to have a bunch of malware. If its even going to the extant of rebooting your phone for a system restore I would be very scared about this.  Someone mentioned that uninstalling the app would remove all marlware with it. If its rebooting the phone for a system restore then my guess is that its releasing some serious files into the root of the system and a simple uninstall of the app isn't going to do much.

Wouldn't popcornexpress run the torrents on your computer via web browser plugin?  It's possible I'm misunderstanding how it works..  Joker.org ran the torrents server side, & cached downloads on the server to playback via web.  That meant that if multiple people ""played"" the same movie/whatever joker.org only torrented the movie once & afterwards just played off the cached download on the server.  It's very similar to how yify-pop works.. unfortunately I don't know any public sites running yify-pop offhand, pretty sure there are some out there."

No,only when you are watching it,as soon as you close the movie you wont seed that partuculary movie anymore.   I got a warning from my Internet provider    The only way you can avoid this is with the use off a VPN service,do some checking before signing up with one.  There's nothing wrong with using your mobile data as long as you doesn't have to pay extra for the data you are using,with 50 gb a month you can watch some movies/series before you run out of data on your phone.  But be sure to hide your streaming/downloading to avoid getting a new letter from your ISP provider,or stick to legal services."

I am underage as well, so my parents received the letters. Get a lawyer, tell him what happened and that should usually be it. It doesn't matter whether you have actually downloaded that movie or not, those copyright trolls look for easy prey and most of the times they will just stop pestering you after they have received a cease and desist notification from your lawyer because it is really hard to actually prove that you have shared copyrighted content without a lot of work so they will just let it go.  Worked for me anyways.  The only annoying thing about it is that you will have to pay the lawyer, so you might wanna get a VPN or maybe a seedbox if you are into private trackers. It's worth the cost for sure considering the de facto inexistent risk to get ""caught"" and the added possibilities for yourself. :)  Hope that helps a little."

They sell them thru DVD rentals, video-on-demand, cable TV channels, movie theaters, etc, etc.    The real issue is you can steal it without consequence.  And then you're rationalizing it by arguing they're charging too much so it's ok to steal.  If 3-D printers and raw materials ever become perfected, almost everything will be stolen and justified for the reason that authorized sellers are charging too much."

PopCornTime,30vk3v,morriscey,2,Tue Mar 31 01:26:15 2015 UTC,Hey man!  I'm in a similar situation. I have multiple people on my home network who I want to secure without them having to do anything and remembering to sign in all the time.  At the moment popcorn time doesn't support custom vpn's in the settings so you can't use PIA by making it sign in automatically whenever you open popcorntime.  Your options are: - use popcorn times supported VPN service - make everyone sign in to their vpn client before they use it - set the vpn clients to open automatically when the computer starts (this means it will always be on). You can use a kill switch with some to make sure it's always working - set up a VPN connection in network settings on the computers and route all data through them (won't support openvpn on Mac)  last but not least (and what I do)   get a DDWRT compatible router and use that to connect you to the VPN at the router level so every device on the network will always be connected and no one has to do anything. Of course this means an always on VPN.
PopCornTime,30vk3v,danboy4,2,Tue Mar 31 05:51:58 2015 UTC,"in the end I'm probably going to go with PIA and have the client auto start on every machine that isn't exclusively for my use.   I'm frustrated I can't currently configure it how I want. My torrent clients, and Kodi are able to use proxies/vpns, I just need popcorn time to be a bit more lenient. The nature of the software makes it laughable that they'd try to force you into using only one paid provider."
PopCornTime,30vk3v,sebrandon1,2,Tue Mar 31 23:12:38 2015 UTC,I'm looking forward to seeing some of that support as well!

I ended up getting privateinternetaccess.com as it seemed to offer the best deal, and the short convo I had with their support beforehand was pretty promising.  5 connections total.   I am currently able to get about 5mbps down / 5 up with a ping of about 50ms. My connection without using the VPN gives about 80 down, 10 up.   for torrents it slows me down a fair bit, but as far as popcorn time goes there is a minimal difference in usage."

I actually have quite a few questions:  Is there a select group of people that choses what goes or not? Are DMCA takedown notices sent somewhere in particular? Who earns the money from the ad clicks on youtube trailers? I know PT is open source, but is it filantropic? in its origins and currently?"
PopCornTime,30smjo,enesimo,2,Tue Mar 31 08:28:42 2015 UTC,"Ill try to answer this since no one else has.  1) Technically no, The tv shows are pulled from a peer2peer group called EZTV, They record the tv shows and distribute them through torrents. So i guess its up to them what they want to record and share. The movie section is much the same but from a group called YIFY from what i understand they buy the films apply their compression (Yes this is dumbed down but what ever) and release them.  2) The DMCA notices would be sent to the groups site most likely, However i think these two don't respond to them, Popcorn Time can't do much with a DMCA as all they do is index content from these two groups.  3) The channel uploader if they have a partnership otherwise google, The trailers are probably scraped somehow.  4) Do you mean philanthropic ? I don't really know how to answer that question. The devs and the release groups are doing this for free if that helps in anyway."

PopCornTime,30cpue,Luretrix2k,2,Fri Mar 27 09:13:41 2015 UTC,"The selection isn't that bad on Netflix, price isn't that high at all either, far from it compared to most if not everything legal.   Of course Popcorn Time has the best selection, because it's illegal and you're able to get anything on it, Netflix have to work within licenses and contracts and are limited due to being legal.   And your last point is essentially what I said."
PopCornTime,30cpue,Alexc26,0,Fri Mar 27 09:41:26 2015 UTC,"The selection isn't that bad on Netflix   Ahhh come on,that's just right out a lie.Their selection sucks big time.Today people want new stuff too,and if they weren't so cheap and pay for some new stuff you would have a better selection,but they probably don't earn enough to do that.Their probably a really struggling company..."
PopCornTime,30cpue,Luretrix2k,2,Fri Mar 27 10:09:22 2015 UTC,"At least do some research before making judgement.  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/03/netflix-oscar-movies_n_4892961.html  If Netflix could then they would get the latest and biggest movies as soon as possible, it's not exactly as simple as ""Here's a million dollars, now give us your movie"" and that's it, there's obviously a ton more work surrounding it, I imagine more for the most popular movies."
PopCornTime,30cpue,Alexc26,1 point,Fri Mar 27 10:15:33 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying that they wouldn't have to work for it,i'm saying they could if they really wanted to make it happen.   But Netflix doesn't actually want to be the place where you find all of the latest blockbusters -- it couldn't do that for a flat $8 per month. Instead, Netflix strives to offer a mix of titles you can't get anywhere else.    And since they are gonna push the cost on the customer alone no one would buy the service if they where to do that,so there's Netflix working to give you the best they can."
PopCornTime,30cpue,Luretrix2k,1 point,Fri Mar 27 10:27:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it would either be all the latest and biggest movies, but the cheap price we pay now (Which is cheap for the amount of content you get), would go up a ton.  For what they offer at the price they offer, and for how easy and quick it is to use on god knows how many platforms, Netflix is pretty great.  Even more so if you have access to a VPN."
PopCornTime,30cpue,Alexc26,1 point,Fri Mar 27 10:29:17 2015 UTC,If they get global licensing like they want I bet they will raise the price for everyone because they will say its more bandwidth that they now need to be able to deliver all their content worldwide.   They raise their price last year when the whole fast lane bullshit was going on and even though they didnt admit that was the reason we all know it was. Now that fast lane by any ISP is illegal and they aren't charging Netflix anymore then Netflix should have lowered their prices back to the way it was.   Yes is was only like $3 dollars extra a month but little by little it will be rising and when you have millions or customers $3 a month extra equals to millions of dollars.  Netflix downfall if it ever happens will be because of greed.

PopCornTime,30cpue,Ashlir,0,Thu Mar 26 14:49:38 2015 UTC,I say raise the price. $8 is nothing compared to the average cable bill. Charge me $30 and give me a better selection. Keep the $8 level for those with a budget but limit the library. The rest of us don't mind paying for more. I would use netflix all the time if it had content but I am forced to use a VPN to get regional stuff and Popcorntime for the rest.

Something like that hasn't happened before.  Plus being open source PT would be patched pretty quickly if there ever was something like that."

PopCornTime,30212q,TimothyGonzalez,2,Mon Mar 23 21:04:22 2015 UTC,"Yes. Change your DNS to use the Google Public DNS system. The DNS servers are at: 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4.  Search the web for how to change them. There's plenty of information.  UK ISPs have two ways to block internet access; both of which have simple workarounds:   Block with the DNS. When your computer tries to find the IP address of some.domainname.com it would normally use the BT / Sky / Virgin DNS servers to tell you where that computer sits. They prevent you from accessing piratebay.se and yts.re by simply refusing to tell you the IP address. SOLUTION: Don't use your ISP's DNS servers; use Google's DNS servers. Many of the UK routers don't allow you to change the DNS servers but you can change them on the computers/devices themselves. Deep Packet Inspection - the ISP will open up your internet packets as they pass through their servers and check to see if they want to allow access. SOLUTION: Always use https. When you access a website that has a https and not a http prefix it will be using SSL cryptography to encrypt the messages between you and the receiving server. It's very rare for a website to not use SSL these days. Technically, it's still possible for the Government/ISP to initiate a MITM (Man In The Middle) attack and intercept those messages BUT we're not living in North Korea yet.   TL;DR - 1. Use Google DNS servers and 2. Always use https versions of websites.  Lastly, when you go to vote in the general election this May, consider whether you want a government that intercepts your communications."

PopCornTime,2zy61c,The7ruth,2,Mon Mar 23 04:29:49 2015 UTC,Some content on popcorn time can be streamed to your Xbox One. This app relies a lot on torrents so you probably won't see it come officially to Xbox at all.
PopCornTime,2zw930,TheFlipperMC,2,Sun Mar 22 11:29:29 2015 UTC,There's also /r/time4popcorn for questions specific to that fork.  Or if you're asking if anyone outside the time4 project has done a code review(?) maybe try the .io forums?  Probably not the right place either but at least the .io devs & other coders are there.

On the other hand, there are countries like Canada where it’s legal to download or stream content provided that you don’t try to reproduce it.

The only weird little issue is when I try to cast to Chromecast. If I have the VPN on before I launch PCT, my ""Cast to Chromecast"" option is gone. My workaround is to turn on PCT, select my movie, THEN turn on VPN, cast to Chromecast, enjoy. It's a very minor thing.  Keep in mind that VPN is a layer of protection, but there are no guarantees."

PopCornTime,2z61lg,dillinger__88,2,Sun Mar 15 22:13:11 2015 UTC,"VPN is only needed for torrenting.(Downloading),you can stream anything through your local network safely. VPN is needed when you download,make sure you are connected before you start any movie or tv show.  If you have any problems with popcorntime detecting your chromecast,start popcorntime first,check that it has detected the chromecast and then connect the VPN service and you should be good to go.

I think it is even greater if you can put in playlist mode in the app so after the current movie finishes downloading completely, it starts downloading the next in the playlist in the background.

PopCornTime,2ymkkl,sentfromytoilet,2,Wed Mar 11 01:36:04 2015 UTC,Hate to disappoint you but it will not be released in the App Store. Apple refuses Popcorn Time applications due to their connection to illigal material.  I'm using popcorntime's HTTPapi so the iphone itself will not download any of the movies of shows. I send a magnet url I get from YTS to the desktop application and it wil start streaming. Still have to figure out a way how to use popcorntime's own playist feature.

PopCornTime,2ybw8z,perseusOFphobos,2,Sun Mar 8 13:11:47 2015 UTC,"so i looked at the code, I'm not terribly knowledgeable in IT security so bare that in mind.  My interest in popcorn-time is based on the wish to get away from Youtube's fiddly and irritating back-end. Also I don't want a big company like google having the power to just turn off my videos.  All the media I wish to distribute I own the rights to do so. So my security adversary are scammers & bot farmers, not governments or corporations.  It's java, so memory overflow attacks are mostly mitigated by the java garbage collection etc. But if the java instance has security bugs so will popcorntime.  It uses allot of the frostwire jlibtorrent dependencies (I have no experience with those), so allot of the torrent network based attack vectors depend on how good the libraries are.  I didn't see any protection against a dropped vpn-connection, so you'll depend on your operating system to prevent popcorntime from just going over the regular un-obfuscated connection if your vpn connection drops.  I didn't see any really obvious flaws, but if you want to be sure, you'd have to kick-start a proper review. So $50k-100k to employ 2 experts for a ~ month to do an in-depth analysis. Nobody is checking open-source unless they get paid to do so, For allot of the open source big companies are depending on, code-reviews are paid for by those companies. For some little community project, it is extremely unlikely to get serious check-ups.     If a government agency with unlimited funds wants to spends those funds on getting you, they can. Besides if you are using it on Windows you are already lost, Microsoft knows exactly what software their users are running. If you are felling paranoid you could learn linux and kvm-containers or bsd and jails. Use a pfsense router to configure your vpn.  But I'm not sure anybody in the political arena wants to hunt pirates, pirates tend to vote for pirate-parties if you go to hard after them. So all the noise about going after piracy is basically just that ... noise. At this point it's about convincing the people that currently don't pirate to continue paying.  My advice: if a bear is hunting you, you don't have to outrun the bear, you just have to outrun somebody else. In other words: ""don't be the low hanging fruit"" & you'll likely be fine."

PopCornTime,2y6x71,boob_grab,1 point,Sat Mar 7 01:41:22 2015 UTC,"Popcorntime just runs out of a folder, there aren't many ""commands"" you need to get to get it working. a .tar.xz file is just a compressed file, like a .zip file on windows. The default file manager in fedora ""nautilus"" has this feature built in, you just right click on the popcormtime.tar.xz file and ""open with archive manager"", and then click ""extract"". Fedy just downloads the latest version for you.  However if you really want to untar the file with the command line you can use   tar -xJf nameoffile.tar.xz  The -J is what specifies the .xz part  However the modern version of tar can figure out the extension for you, so if in the future you want to open a tar.gz file or any other varient, you can just use  tar xf nameoffile.tar.xz  or tar.gz  to understand this a little more you could also break up the extraction into two commands  .xz is a lossless data compression format and to undo that you would use  unxz whatever.tar.xz  which would produce  whatever.tar  which you can then  tar -xf whatever.tar  which would give you a folder called   whatever  Basically what I'm saying is that there  is a million ways to do this and the command line way isn't the most convenient or necessary. Using the command line for the command line's sake is fine and all, but I prefer to use it when it is actually useful like proper package management or editing textfiles with vi or vim.  Hopefully this helps."

If it has bad health of course you will have problems watching with good speed.  Have you tried the magnet link?  And what speed do you get from you're network? You can check it here:  http://www.speedtest.net/
PopCornTime,2y0www,Luretrix2k,1 point,Thu Mar 5 15:00:56 2015 UTC,speedtests are kind of junk considering many ISPs will prioritize traffic to make them look good

PopCornTime,2y0www,matttrick,0,Thu Mar 19 12:22:30 2015 UTC,Yup I'm guessing the health is the issue. It has 0 seeds. Guess I'll have to find somewhere else to watch it.
PopCornTime,2y0www,Luretrix2k,2,Thu Mar 19 12:23:21 2015 UTC,"You can go to any site like piratbay and kickass and find one with better health,then you can  just drag/drop/copy/paste any torrent/magnet link right into popcorntime.

PopCornTime,2xrvik,RotarySeven,5,Tue Mar 3 10:16:38 2015 UTC,That's probably because you are trying to cast the 720p version of the show. Unfortunately the audio of the 720p version doesn't work (yet) on the Chromecast. Movies work because they use a different encoding.
PopCornTime,2xrvik,ulTimaS1989,1 point,Tue Mar 3 10:40:42 2015 UTC,"Chromecast can't handle mkv container, nor can it handle the audio format that usually come with the 720p files.

PopCornTime,2xk2ws,Luretrix2k,1 point,Sun Mar 1 19:42:33 2015 UTC,No problem. The problem is usually that people had installed it in the wrong place so popcorntime can't detect it when it search you're computer for external players. Just glad to see you could make it work.

PopCornTime,2xd1ac,RandomSpeedArt,1 point,Sat Feb 28 09:28:59 2015 UTC,"Like I know they are doing the right thing bcos piracy is illegal, but the Australian government  are just bending over and being hollywood's bitch with this whole piracy issue."
PopCornTime,2xd1ac,Luretrix2k,3,Sun Mar 1 02:14:02 2015 UTC,"I agree something needs to be done about piracy, but here is the thing:  Forcing ISP's to give information to copyright owners (Hollywood studios) is the wrong way to go about it. They are the problem, and they can't be the solution. And the whole system is flawed anyway because all it means for Australia, is that more people are going to be paying for VPN's which just takes money out of the economy, which is a big problem for the country, on top of the money that is going to be spent on this NSA style monitoring infrastructure   The government needs to not look for a kill solution, but instead figure out why people in Australia torrent so much in the first place, and come out with some alternatives. People in Australia torrent so much for these reasons   Foxtel is the only way to view content - We don't have netflix in Australia and for most people streaming is out of the option because download speeds are so slow. Why do people want to pay $60 a month for Foxtel on-top of the internet?  TV is not convenient - You have to conform to a schedule when you watch TV, unless you want to pay even more so you can record shows. There is also a massive inconvenience in the price of TV to setup. $60 for base Foxtel, several hundred for a technician to set it up and pay for the box, and roof mount and then if you want to make it for convenient it is $10 extra for IQ2 so you can record. Now that is only the base package, if you want to get the channels for everything you watch then you need to pay closer to $100 a month. Ads on TV - No one wants to sit through ads, which makes viewing online even more of a positive. Australia Delay - If you watch on Foxtel you are going to be watching everything with a delay. You have to wait about 24 hours to view the next episode of Game Of Thrones, when other countries get to view it way earlier. Shows that I watch like Arrow and Flash, don't premier in Australia until 2-3 weeks after other countries. I can download and watch it, when I want, within minutes of its premier in America.   Australia doesn't need to remove piracy, they need to figure out new ideas and ways for people to watch and download shows they want to watch and the piracy rate will naturally go down. If Netflix was in Australia I know I would use that, but using a VPN and trying to stream just doesn't give me the speeds I need to stream at 1080p or even 720p.   I think Australian citizens need to push for net neutrality and need to petition against these new laws that are about to be introduced. If these new laws get put in place they will be here for years to come, and for the next probably 10-20 years Hollywood fat cats will just be waiting for notifications to pop up so they can take people to court and sue them so they get more money. This is not what we want in the future of Australia, we want a more free internet, not more restricted."

PopCornTime,2wsg35,korrtuul,3,Wed Feb 25 07:08:42 2015 UTC,Maybe it's not released in the aquired quality yet? Popcorntime doesn't control any content.Movies come from YTS they only have HQ stuff.Not bad cam versions like the other fork has.  It fetches movies from here:  https://yts.re/home  Series: https://eztv.ch/  Anime: http://www.haruhichan.com/  So that's where you need to go if you have a request or wan't to see what's coming.Or just to bitch about their selection.

I use LocalCast to accomplish above with Show Box (Popcorn Time alternative - streams from dedicated servers instead of torrents) .

Wow, let's all just stop telling them when something stops working or something isn't as good and just move on to another video solution? Oh wait then popcorn time will cease to exist because nobody is bloody using it.  There is nothing wrong with notifying a developer of an issue.  As far as the subreddit goes you stated yourself that the devs don't tend to come here often and that in order for them to see posts about issues the posts need to be on the forums. I for one would rather check with the community before hassling devs if there is no need. If I am having a personal issue i'd like to know if it's just me or if others have the issue and potentially have a solution before making an official post about it on the forums.

Let's take some quotes from a few different people in this thread alone:   more likely the return of the non-working software   &   Still not working for me, movies not showing up   &   The download time takes hours per episode and when I finally get the episode up and running, it stops every ten seconds to buffer or whatever it's doing   &   Connecting..............   &   Still can`t see my chromecast and apple tv inside the app   And this is only this single thread. I'm not even going to quote the front page right now but there's a reason most of those are downvoted to 0 points. There is indeed a big difference between stating something works or not and whining but whenever I have to explain a problem to somebody, I make sure to include as much details as possible.  ""IT'S NOT WORKING FIX IT NOW ASAP!"" Isn't going to help anyone. At LEAST include some details about what you were doing, maybe some log files,.. anything to help the developers point to the cause of the problem. But this is NOT notifying the devs of an issue..  And about that: I can't help but point this out over and over again but POST YOUR ISSUES ON THE FORUM. That way, devs will pick up and maybe actually try to fix it. Posting ""I don't see my Chromecast"" isn't going to help shit, maybe you get lucky and some redditor will point you in the right direction but then again: 99% of the problems you may encounter have already been reported a thousand times and have fixes for them.

PopCornTime,2w2z3j,Pregnant_Bill_Cosby,-2,Tue Feb 17 06:37:09 2015 UTC,"""more likely the return of the non-working software"" Is the only quote that you can have issue with. The rest are whats fucking happening for the other people. You can fuck right off complaining about them.  Yes, it's only this thread. You chose to blow a fuse in this thread when there is nothing in this thread to blow a fuse at. Do you not see what is wrong with that?  None of those are ""IT'S NOT WORKING FIX IT NOW ASAP!"", not even close. You want details?  2nd one from the top means that the movies are still not showing up meaning that the fix did nothing for them but IIRC their update just didn't hit properly and it fixed itself.  3rd one is about an issue regarding download times, the person is likely not tech savvy enough to understand what is causing the issue therefore needs to be told what information is relevant to the fucking problem. In all likelihood it's simply their internet/vpn whatever.  4th one implies that they are getting stuck on the connection screen.  5th one is because they can't see their chromecast and apple tv and want input regarding this.  It's fucking hilarious that you expect people to know what information they need to provide, I consider myself good with computers but I ain't no programmer or coder. I have no idea what information would be needed for all of these problems bar the download one which could be down to any number of things.  I'll just leave you to whine about people saying it how it is."

PopCornTime,2vxg69,mrvix,12,Sun Feb 15 09:50:46 2015 UTC,"Exit popcorntime.  Now navigate to your Popcorn-Time.app which is probably located in your applications folder.  Once there, do a right click/ctrl click (depending if you are using a track pad or mouse) and select ""display package contents"".  Once selected, it should open a finder window and you will see a folder called ""Contents"" .  Navigate to the following path… Contents/Applications/Popcorn-Time.app/Contents/Resources/app.nw/src/app/settings.js  Open the settings.js file in a text editor (you can use the mac text edit app if you like). Once the .js file is open in your text editor, the simplest thing is to do a text search for the first line of code in the link /u/popcorntimefix mentioned (select ""Find"" in the ""Edit"" menu or press cmd+f).  Once you have found it and have highlighted the whole section of code, simply delete and save.  I suggest if you are not familiar with doing this sort of thing, you leave the .js file open until you have tested popcorntime just in case you deleted the wrong line of code by accident.  That way you just have to do a cmd+z to undo it and you can try again.  Good luck!"

(3.7 or the 5.2)  I've noticed the getting hung on the looking for peers on 5.2  I usually go back and click the icon at the bottom of the movie description page (seeders/health info) and pick the 2nd seeder list. Restart the movie and the peers start showing up right away.

PopCornTime,2vbhk1,Veloxy,9,Mon Feb 9 17:35:17 2015 UTC,"No, it does not protect you.   The point of a VPN is to securely reroute your traffic so that your ISP (or anybody in between) can sniff and ""read"" the packets you send and receive.   When you connect to your NAS from your local area network (LAN) it connects to the tracker from your home router.  When you connect to an external VPN your computer connects to the remote VPN server and then to the tracker.   The tracker sees the IP address of the VPN server, not your home router's IP address."
PopCornTime,2vbhk1,vstanchev,3,Mon Feb 9 18:17:10 2015 UTC,"Alright, thanks. I figured as much after looking up some graphics explaining VPN. I guess I'll go rent a VPS somewhere and set it up as a VPN server."
PopCornTime,2vbhk1,Hartofriends,1 point,Mon Feb 9 18:36:09 2015 UTC,Off topic but i see alot of people on this sub talking about VPN's are there any particular reason you are so intent on making your connections anonymous?
PopCornTime,2vbhk1,aurora-_,1 point,Wed Feb 11 21:50:38 2015 UTC,"Since PopcornTime uses torrenting, it shares the show/movie you're watching as you're watching it. You download it from people who have it, and share to people who don't. In many places around the world, sharing that content is illegal, and using a VPN helps protect the user from his ISP or government knowing they're torrenting."
PopCornTime,2vbhk1,Hartofriends,1 point,Thu Feb 12 04:36:18 2015 UTC,Has anyone actually been arrested for torrenting?   I havent heard of any instances like that here in Denmark.  But thanks for the explanation!
PopCornTime,2vbhk1,aurora-_,2,Thu Feb 12 17:42:49 2015 UTC,"You're welcome! I don't know about Denmark but in the US if you keep getting caught torrenting over 6 times, most ISPs will tell the content owners who you are and you'll get sued. It's pretty rare but sucks"

PopCornTime,2uz2rd,fabulousunicorn27,10,Fri Feb 6 10:53:33 2015 UTC,If she complies and pays then they will get her to admitting to it. Throw the letter in the trash. If they contact you again just tell them you had your router open to wifi unprotected and they can't really do anything.  Get a good vpn and never get those letters again.
PopCornTime,2uz2rd,Hadouken125,5,Fri Feb 6 19:25:23 2015 UTC,Stay safe and use a VPN service.If you hide/mask your torrenting/streaming there will be no problem.
PopCornTime,2uz2rd,Luretrix2k,11,Fri Feb 6 12:26:18 2015 UTC,Yes you can. PopcornTime utilizes peer-to-peer file sharing of copyrighted content. By using it you are participating in copyright infringement.  Like other torrent clients PopcornTime 'seeds' (uploads) the data that you download. This is where they catch you.
PopCornTime,2uz2rd,ressurrectin,5,Fri Feb 6 12:19:31 2015 UTC,Anyone in the US gotten any warnings yet? I have a VPN but barely use it since the free version I have is slow and not really for streaming video.

PopCornTime,2uz2rd,Ninebythreeinch,3,Fri Feb 6 19:40:14 2015 UTC,Apparently there have been multiple lawsuits in Germany according to Wikipedia and Golem.de.
PopCornTime,2uz2rd,tinu1212,5,Fri Feb 6 13:28:13 2015 UTC,"Section 2. Legality of article  Popcorn Time:       The legality of Popcorn Time matched that of all other Bittorrent clients plus the additional factor that applies to sites like the Piratebay and YTS itself, due to the explicit linking to movie content; its website claimed that the software ""might"" be illegal depending on local laws.   As with other Bittorrent clients, the IP addresses of users can easily be determined by third parties. In early 2015 many German Popcorn Time users received demands for damages of 815 Euros. The high amount was justified by the fact that the application not just downloads but also distributes movies,  a fact that not all users were aware of.

PopCornTime,2ux6ny,Luretrix2k,2,Thu Feb 5 23:07:03 2015 UTC,Give it a try and report back.When streaming isn't smud it's often bad connection/low speed or they are trying to play a movie/episode witch have bad health(Not enough people sharing). You can check the movie/episode health in popcorntime.On episodes you need to press the little dot and wait for it to change colour.

You mentioned you connected PT to other screens via mirroring, did you use some sort of external software for it or are you referring to something like Chromecast/DLNA?

PopCornTime,2u5762,lockey1995,2,Fri Jan 30 00:42:32 2015 UTC,"You can fix the problem by updating the yts api url to a one which was working and not blocked by your ISP. You can update the yts API url by going to '%localappdata%\Popcorn Time\src\app' on windows and opening the settings.js file with a text editor and changing the main url string inside the Settings.ytsAPI array to a yts proxy which works. I changed line the url value on line 105 from 'https://yts.re/api/' which is currently down (returning 503 service temporarily unavailable) to 'https://yts.im/api/' which is currently working for me and my ISP. I recommend that you find a yts proxy which works with your ISP and isn't down and replacing the origional url with the new endpoint which you have found. (You can also possibly change the url to something like ""http://proxy.piratenpartij.nl/yts.im/api/"" using a proxy website but pointing it to yts.re is useless at the moment since the actual website is unavailable and the proxy will just reach the same point). Hope this helps you while the default yts endpoint is down. (Sorry for the chunk of text but I've never been too good at making text flow)  Edit: Turns out at the time when I posted this the default yts website came back up and stopped returning 503's. I'll leave this as this can still be considered useful if you are unable to reach yts.re and need to add your own vts url."

PopCornTime,2u0ry4,brickfrog2,1 point,Thu Jan 29 01:40:27 2015 UTC,"I suppose you could try blocking the APIs that PT uses to display movies/TV/etc, that would keep it from loading a ""database"" of titles & such.  Keep in mind that wouldn't stop someone from being able to use PT completely (someone can simply drag-and-drop the magnet link or .torrent file onto the PT window to stream).  But maybe preventing it from updating its list of movies/TV/etc is all you're trying to do?  Try compiling a list of API addresses, block them all, & then see how it goes.  If you search the sub you should be able to figure out all the different APIs PT uses & go from there.  But yeah, none of that will stop anyone from streaming movie torrents.  It's not like PT is the only torrent client that can stream movies."

PopCornTime,2tpciu,UltraChilly,1 point,Mon Jan 26 09:43:16 2015 UTC,This is not true. For example the YIFY copy of The Life of Pi does not have hard coded subs for the French and Hindi speaking parts but they are there on the bluray version.  This may have been the case when subtitle support was low (~5 years ago)  but now most devices and software support srt files.

Using vlc and the intrernal player on the windows app, works perfrct. Not slow at all. Its just when i stream on cc. Stuck at 99%.  Is there still no news on cast for vlc? That would be a solution since streaning in vlc works.   Also, i tried the copy url trick: http://www.geektime.com/2014/03/12/stream-movies-from-popcorn-time-on-chromecast/ but when i paste the url to chrome, it initiates an avi download. Do u think on the previous version of the app it would work?"
PopCornTime,2tklmi,Luretrix2k,2,Sun Jan 25 05:46:45 2015 UTC,If you go to your chromcast app on your phone you can mirror any thing on your screen(will work to cast from the android app to your chromecast)  When it comes to the desktop version i would recomend videostream if you need to use a 3 party app.You can find it here:  https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/videostream-for-google-ch/cnciopoikihiagdjbjpnocolokfelagl  It will send almost any format with subtitles to your chromecast and comes with a handy remote you can use from your phone so you never have to leave the couch.
PopCornTime,2tklmi,Luretrix2k,1 point,Sun Jan 25 05:50:08 2015 UTC,"Oh that mirroring feature on my phone does not work. Im using an asus phone. I think its just for samsungs and sony phones...  That only works on the chrome browser right? Well my problem is, i cant get popcorntime to stream the video ON chrome and not their player. What do u think?"
PopCornTime,2tklmi,Luretrix2k,2,Sun Jan 25 05:54:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah you may be right on the mirror thing from your phone.  Make a folder on your desktop.Go to settings in popcorntime.press advanced settings,scroll down to cache directory,press the line where you see the location,not the folder.there you can replace it with the folder you just made.uncheck the box where it says TMP.Now any movie/serie you download in popcorntime is in that folder with any subs you pre selected in settings. Then you can use videostream to send it too chromecast."
PopCornTime,2tklmi,mibzman,1 point,Sun Jan 25 06:01:32 2015 UTC,So what it does is it downloads the file? I was thinking of just streaming it so it wont take up space and internet speed.
PopCornTime,2tklmi,Battle_Blazer,2,Sun Jan 25 06:17:12 2015 UTC,"It downloads it anyway,only diffrence now you can use the file in a diffrent program if popcorntime+chromecast doesn't work.  When you close the app all files get deleted if the TMP box is checked.or just remove them manually from the folder if you deside to make it."
PopCornTime,2tklmi,Battle_Blazer,1 point,Sun Jan 25 06:22:14 2015 UTC,"Will i have to wait for the download to finish though before i can stream it? (just like how normal direct downloads work)  Well i just tried it and its not playing. It just says ""connecting"". Should I use the internal player?  edit: OK IT DID WORK. turns out it will not play on the internal player. its just stuck on 99%. I checked out the folder i made and looked for an avi file, IT CAN STREAM while it downloads (how cool is that). I played it on vlc. BUT I cant open it using chrome!"
PopCornTime,2tl6o9,bamburger,1 point,Sun Jan 25 05:08:16 2015 UTC,it happens to me only when I open PT first and then turn on my chromecast. The chromecast has to be on before opening PT I think.
PopCornTime,2tl6o9,SteveV91,-4,Tue Jan 27 20:53:11 2015 UTC,"It's probably because the app is in BETA stage,it want work perfect for everyone on all the diffrent machines out there. You could try to ask for a refund?"

PopCornTime,2thgg7,RuleEnforcer3,2,Sat Jan 24 04:41:51 2015 UTC,Settings look good. Choose auto server selection unless you have a reason to connect out of country (like different Netflix).  You only need PIA on the computer that you use popcorn time on. Doesn't hurt though to have it on the others. Nothing wrong with some added security.
PopCornTime,2thgg7,chmbrs,1 point,Sat Jan 24 06:10:52 2015 UTC,"I use PIA as well. I actually don't even check the DNS leak or IPv6 because it has caused my download speed within PT to drop from 700+kb/s to like 150. May need to look into it more, but have you noticed any fluctuations with download speeds?"

PopCornTime,2tg3qy,kyle_maddisson,1 point,Sat Jan 24 03:30:38 2015 UTC,"I've been using PIA for about 8 months. Most of the time it is preety sweet --once you get it setup right. The acronym PIA is perfect for it. Not because of the name private internet acces, but because it's a pain in the ass to use it. The speeds were phenomonal. I would upwards of 150 Mbps at times, sometimes 265 Mpbs on speedtest.net. You will never get that much when downloading files.   The downside is I constantly have to go into the networks setting and reset it to automatically detect the IP settings, and depending on your antivirus program, it may lose connection everytime it renews the IP address. Right now I am having problems  with it where I am only getting 2.24 Mbps down, and if I change it to automatically detect IP settings, I get no connection at all. Without the VPN connected I get 27 Mbps. Why am I getting a 88% reduction in speed with the VPN. Coincidentally, I got a copywright infringement notice a couple weeks ago, and my speeds have been nowhere near what they used to be since, which makes me question how private they really are."

PopCornTime,2tfp5p,geedub85,6,Fri Jan 23 20:57:24 2015 UTC,"Yes it deletes it when you close the program, there is a tick box in the advanced setstings to allow it to save downloaded items to the listed folder.  It allows you to watch them instantly (and share them) while popcorn time is running."
PopCornTime,2tfp5p,no6969el,2,Fri Jan 23 21:23:35 2015 UTC,I always thought this was against how the bittorent protocol worked and that it had to be totally random pieces being downloaded
PopCornTime,2tfp5p,colonelcack,3,Sat Jan 24 03:35:11 2015 UTC,You can change the settings to download sequentially in any good torrent client. It's just slower to complete.
PopCornTime,2tfp5p,geedub85,5,Sat Jan 24 12:44:46 2015 UTC,"Where does a youtube video go after you see it?   It's the same, it gets stored in a temporal folder until you close your browser, then it's deleted.  Go to settings, click advanced settings, go to the bottom and see ""cache directory""   From there you can change where to store the movies and if you want to automaticly delete them after you've seen it or not."

If you want it to start in spesific player just pick the player before you start. If you want to help seed/ stuff that appear in popcontime you need to do it with this providers.You can also try to download directly from them.Or even simpler pay Netflix the money,they have alot of old shows.
