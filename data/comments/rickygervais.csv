rickygervais,3dxf2i,GABBO63,3,Mon Jul 20 09:31:38 2015 UTC,"I've got no idea what has happened to Gervais. A full blown mid-life personality transformation, up there with Walter White.  He used to be one of my favourite people but cannot stand him these days."
rickygervais,3dxf2i,MrGhkl444,3,Mon Jul 20 11:13:59 2015 UTC,He seems to have lost his grounding.  I think he was the driving force with the old gang but Steve definitely streamlined Ricky.
rickygervais,3dxf2i,Bazzmania,2,Mon Jul 20 11:34:41 2015 UTC,"The chemistry between Ricky, Karl and Steve was pure joy, I still like them all but when their all together it was great . Whether they have just drifted apart doing their own projects or there is something more I don't know . Funny thing is out of all three I'm looking forward to Karl's Moaning of life 2 the most..."
rickygervais,3dxf2i,ShetlandJames,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:43:02 2015 UTC,Ricky has been using cunt liberally for ages.  I still think he's great despite what most people on here seem to think! His recent animal rights stuff has brought him a whole new bunch of fans too
rickygervais,3dxf2i,DrPigeonShinz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:22:18 2015 UTC,"Its used to be used cleverly though, and only his fans would see/hear it on the podcasts.  Now he just flings it around for the sake of shocking people on facebook.  Don't get me wrong, I always hope he'll reignite whatever made us love him in the first place but he seems to believe all the hype about him these days.  And on his animal rights issues, I've not been following him much lately - is he a vegetarian or vegan now?"
rickygervais,3dst7y,moistbutter,4,Sun Jul 19 02:55:39 2015 UTC,I doubt he's intentionally gaining weight just for the role. Think that post was a bit tongue in cheek.
rickygervais,3dst7y,DrPigeonShinz,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:41:22 2015 UTC,Ricky is seriously crazy
rickygervais,3dst7y,mokoko__,5,Sun Jul 19 22:22:08 2015 UTC,"Im not taking this photo out of context either, he said it on his fb page. Its a shame, he spent so long trying to get fit, now he's putting back on for a film that no one asked for."
rickygervais,3dst7y,markob53,2,Sun Jul 19 11:59:26 2015 UTC,"He's putting the weight on to play an incredibly popular character, since when do the public have to 'ask' for movies to be made for it to make sense, he obviously get's enough positive feedback from fans of The Office to know it's worth doing.  I will, however argue that he doesn't need to put weight on to play Brent, he's done skits with him being skinnier before and what's wrong with just saying Brent lost weight? Unless he wants to stay true to character everyone remembers from The Office.  Also actors regularly lose and put on weight for roles, i'm sure he'll lose it straight away after filming is done."
rickygervais,3dst7y,postnerd33000,-2,Tue Jul 21 15:12:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, crazy that their doing a David Brent film w/o Merchant.  Talk about a shameless cash grab!  Oh well, i hope it nets him millions of dollars, he's earned it in my book.  Let the man relax and do what he wants to do."

rickygervais,3dlwdg,whatisthishere,37,Fri Jul 17 09:33:30 2015 UTC,Because Karl still owes Steve that 50p.
rickygervais,3dlwdg,Guyatolla,8,Fri Jul 17 10:58:31 2015 UTC,Its just 50p!!!

rickygervais,3dlwdg,mokoko__,31,Sat Jul 18 00:55:04 2015 UTC,how do you know about their levels of friendship
rickygervais,3dlwdg,LittleSandor,2,Fri Jul 17 10:20:59 2015 UTC,"I was listening to some old radio stuff, and Stephen was complaining how Ricky doesn't even invite him to his birthday party, but he invites tons of people, including Karl.  They also talk about Karl and Ricky hanging out all the time, it is obvious they are friends.  Ricky and Stephen don't even have a relationship where they go to each others birthday parties."
rickygervais,3dlwdg,Ozarkian,14,Sat Jul 18 00:54:36 2015 UTC,"I think Steve had a life outside of Ricky. He often would talk about his mates (he even had his own radio show with some of them on I think). Karl on the other hand kept to himself and Ricky was not a big party goer so they were the kind of mates that could just hang out and go for a pint. I don't know if they were better friends, I just think Karl and Steve were different kinds of friends to Ricky. Steve someone he could collaborate and banter with and Karl someone he could rough house and talk nonsense with. Karl and Steve are just too different, I think they have or had mutual respect for each other but there wasn't a lot of overlap in interest or humour."
rickygervais,3dlwdg,Au_Struck_Geologist,9,Fri Jul 17 12:12:13 2015 UTC,"He never says it, but my impression is that Steve is actually somewhat upper middle class. Ricky and Karl were both from poorer areas."
rickygervais,3dlwdg,RachelRTR,7,Fri Jul 17 15:55:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he doesn't really have to say it"
rickygervais,3dlwdg,peachgin,3,Fri Jul 17 16:06:26 2015 UTC,"He always talked about being from the ""West country"" and I always thought that was a poor rural area the way they make fun of him for it. Such as when Karl says ""I thought there must be a tractor sale on somewhere."""
rickygervais,3dlwdg,SolKool,4,Fri Jul 17 17:14:39 2015 UTC,"Not especially poor, but a lot of it is very rural with small towns/villages and farmland. Stereotypically, saying someone with a West Country accent sounds like a farmer (or a pirate) is pretty common."

rickygervais,3dlwdg,JCFC23,4,Mon Jul 20 20:50:12 2015 UTC,"Who knows what their friendship is like in real life? All I know is that it's not like they all met in high school or something, Ricky met Steve while he was hiring someone at his office job and Steve submitted his resume"
rickygervais,3dlwdg,Titser,2,Fri Jul 17 11:21:28 2015 UTC,is there any interviews of ricky/steve explaining how they met? i mean im sure there is but i havent seen any
rickygervais,3dlwdg,RachelRTR,3,Fri Jul 17 15:06:38 2015 UTC,"I will not be able to find it for you, but Ricky once told the story on XFM how he needed another person to do the show with and Steve's CV was the one on the top of the pile of resumes."

rickygervais,3dlwdg,GeeMunz11,2,Fri Jul 17 17:33:59 2015 UTC,Karl always thinks stephen looks weird. and Ricky is always the one that wanted to explore the mind of Karl no matter how stupid it is.

rickygervais,3df9do,hangingbacon,3,Wed Jul 15 22:17:31 2015 UTC,Are there remasters of the remaining series? Karls voice was too quiet and Ricky's laugh was deafening on the original recordings.
rickygervais,3df9do,PerfectAlias,2,Thu Jul 16 02:38:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think someone remastered the early Series 1 shows once years ago, but I doubt you'll be able to find those files, and I certainly don't have them. I might get round to it at some point but levelling all the volumes would be pretty hard work."

rickygervais,3df9do,b0nkybonk,5,Wed Jul 15 22:11:16 2015 UTC,These aren't the XFM Series 1 shows where Karl's mic was quiet. These are the pre-Capital shows from 1998 before Ricky and Steve had even met Karl. http://www.pilkipedia.co.uk/wiki/index.php?title=Xfm_Series_0

rickygervais,3df9do,b0nkybonk,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:50:49 2015 UTC,"It's really annoying listening to the ones when Karl just started being involved, because you can barely hear a word Karl says. I think even when Karl had his own mic and was involved in every show he kept his own mic really low."

rickygervais,3de8r8,mandrew6,8,Wed Jul 15 17:22:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, lots of Karl's stories actually happened, he just doesn't actually read them. He reads the headline and makes up the rest of the story."
rickygervais,3de8r8,RumbleJos,9,Wed Jul 15 18:47:36 2015 UTC,"It also has to do with Karl's understanding of the story. That's Ricky's point. Even in XFM, people email him to say it's true, but Ricky's argument is not that it's true or not but that Karl thinks of it differently. Sigh."
rickygervais,3de8r8,aravinddav92,2,Wed Jul 15 20:16:32 2015 UTC,"True, the filter that is Karl's brain surely doesn't leave any story intact. Either he just doesn't understand it or the facts strand somewhere between his brain and his mouth. That must be the main reason why he often comes up with ridiculous stuff, but the amount of times he admitted to just plain not reading the story and looking at the headline and pictures instead (""because I'm busy!"") surprised me. I mean, who does that?   Little orange-headed manc twat..."
