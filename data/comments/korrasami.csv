korrasami,3dcmzp,ShadowKingthe7,2,Wed Jul 15 17:43:08 2015 UTC,Not as fucked up as my headcanon in which Korra is not able to be the mom because of the internal damage associated with having the poison in her system for three years :/
korrasami,3dcmzp,Csantana,2,Wed Jul 15 16:10:36 2015 UTC,"I feel like with water heal bending they can probably get that sorted out, but that is still a very good point and I'm kinda sad."
korrasami,3dcmzp,ShadowKingthe7,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:44:06 2015 UTC,"On the bright side, this should not stop Korra from using the Avatar state to allow Asami to carry their child"
korrasami,3dcmzp,Csantana,2,Wed Jul 15 20:35:47 2015 UTC,"I don't think the Avatar state gives you the ability to grow a dick haha  However I have seen some fan art that shows them coming out of the spirit world and Asami is pregnant (not the first trip we see at the end of the last season). I feel like I could get behind that, like some magical spirit stuff makes it so it biologically both theirs."

korrasami,3dcyeo,Drowmonk,3,Wed Jul 15 16:22:29 2015 UTC,"That's interesting. I had the opposite arc as far as liking Mako.   Back to topic, this was funny. I like Korra and Asami being like: ""Dude, he is SOOO bad at breakups."""
korrasami,3dcyeo,SemiJuggalo,3,Wed Jul 15 16:40:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, when I re-watched Book 1 a couple of months ago, I had completely forgotten how much I used to like Mako. Once he started to warm up, he became much more likeable. Heck, there was once a time when I wanted to see where the love triangle was headed! Under better circumstances, I really wouldn't have minded him getting with Korra, but we all know how THAT turned out (I'm still not completely over that, either)."
korrasami,3dcyeo,BlackNova0604,2,Wed Jul 15 18:33:17 2015 UTC,"I liked Mako even after their breakup. I didn't start not liking him until he ""got back"" with Asami. But after Korra lost her memory is S2 and he didn't tell her they were broken up, that's when I thought he was a scumbag. I didn't forgive him for it until he nearly sacrificed himself in the show finale. I still think he should've died..."
korrasami,3dcyeo,SemiJuggalo,2,Wed Jul 15 19:24:45 2015 UTC,"Personally, I never wanted to dislike Mako, because I still like certain aspects of his character. Of course, I was disappointed with how sloppily he handled things with Asami in Book 1, but I still had hope that he would get his act together. However, when he lied to Korra, right in front of Asami, that's when I abandoned the Makorra ship for good.  I still think he should've died...  Well, that's harsh.  Although I don't agree with your sentiment, I'm pretty sure Bryke did consider killing him off. However, they probably changed their minds, since it would have led to even more backlash."
korrasami,3dcyeo,BlackNova0604,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:44:15 2015 UTC,"To be clear, I didn't want him to die because I hated him. In my mind, if he sacrificed himself like Sato did, it would've ""redeemed"" him for me."

korrasami,3d1612,hamster_ears,9,Sun Jul 12 17:43:27 2015 UTC,"Strictly speaking, no it's not necessary. But there are several in-jokes and probably a few important plot points you won't understand unless you do watch TLA first. Also some of the major characters from TLA are still alive and make an appearance in LoK. There are even a couple who aren't alive that still show up.  I'd really recommend you give TLA a go before jumping into LoK. It's definitely worth it. 5 episodes isn't really a big enough sample to accurately judge TLA in my opinion."
korrasami,3d1612,SirNastyPants,9,Sun Jul 12 17:47:53 2015 UTC,"The first season of ATLA is kind of rough to get into because it's kids on an adventure of hijinks and general immaturity. It picks  up towards the end of the season and does lay the groundwork to show how significantly the characters change. I watched the film that shall not be named first, then started the first season; the fact that the characters had personalities and acted like kids was enough to hook me."

korrasami,3d1612,MllePotatochips,3,Mon Jul 13 23:21:41 2015 UTC,I fell in love with Korrasami through fanarts (ironically while searching for Makorra pics) - never had watched ATLA when I started catching up on LOK (season 4 was just beginning to air) and I got around just fine.  I watched ATLA way after LOK so I won't say it's essential to watch it first but it helps + ATLA is worth watching too.
korrasami,3d1612,Parsoleathi,2,Sun Jul 12 18:16:54 2015 UTC,"As a person that watched LoK before I watched ATLA, I would personally recommend that you watch ATLA first. I went back and watched Korra again after finally viewing ATLA, and I gotta say I liked it much better the second time. There are so many little things and emotional context you won't be able to appreciate as much without having seen ATLA first.   That and ATLA is just really really good, so you should see it anyway! Give it to midway in the second book and I bet you'll be hooked. You won't regret it! (Except when there's no more to watch that is)!"
korrasami,3d1612,my_shoes_hurt,2,Sun Jul 12 21:37:47 2015 UTC,"I feel like ATLA Season 1 is by far the weakest season of both Avatar and Korra, so I can't blame you for not finding it amazing after 5 episodes. That said, I do recommend you watch it. Try S01E12 ""The Storm"" first, it's a really good episode that explores the backstory of the first season's two most important characters."
korrasami,3d1612,regendo,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:15:14 2015 UTC,"I definitely think you should watch ATLA first because it sets up the world of the Avatar. You'll be able to appreciate and understand LoK better once you've seen ATLA. (This is coming from someone who watched LoK Book 1 before ATLA.) ATLA starts out a little slow, especially in Book 1, but it just gets better and better. The Book 1 season finale is absolutely amazing, and then Books 2 and 3 are just fantastic."
korrasami,3d1612,justsing17,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:40:57 2015 UTC,"Nah, I watched Korra first without any knowledge of the Avatar world, and then while I was waiting for season 3 to air I started watching Avatar season 1.

Thank you all so much. :)  I drew this picture because of what I felt was the intensity of their connection to one another. Their bond that was shown in the ""Korra Alone"" episode especially made me feel the final scene was appropriate. I loved that episode more than any other in the season. Again, I personally thought that final scene was perfect as it was. It was subtle and powerful and I wouldn't change a single thing about it.

korrasami,3cuwek,HydrogenHuman,11,Fri Jul 10 23:45:28 2015 UTC,"I wrote a long rambling post, but it was disjointed an no one would've read it.  To make a long post short, the second half of season 3 of ATLA was the best thing to happen to Kataang.  Makorra was forced and rushed, but I forgive it because at the time of writing they thought it would be a 12 part mini-series.  Masami was weird the whole way through, but I feel that many of Mako's decisions were realistic for a confused young man, although I'm bothered that Asami didn't yell at him.  Korrasami was slowly built up over two seasons, so subtly that a fair portion of the fandom didn't realize or accept what was happening.  I think a part of that is due to a general lack of subtly, especially in relationships, from Bryke.  I also think it's excellent writing and gives me high hopes for the comics.  TL;DR I agree with the OP"
korrasami,3cuwek,sparrowjj,6,Sat Jul 11 07:47:53 2015 UTC,"OP here, and I fully agree with everything you said, especially about Korrasami.  Because Bryke was so ""in your face"" about virtually every other relationship prior, the fandom got used to that style and when Korrasami finally brought something different they were ""blindsided"" by it.  I personally knew they were planning something during episode 1 of Book 3, but at that point it was just developing a strong bond between Korra & Asami.  Once the finale of Book 3 occurred though, then I realized the chances of a romantic arc were much higher. And once Book 4 continued that trend, all I was hoping was the network wouldn't block them."
korrasami,3cuwek,RedZenin,5,Sat Jul 11 13:41:53 2015 UTC,+1
korrasami,3cuwek,EggheadDash,3,Sat Jul 11 04:27:30 2015 UTC,Quick correction: Bryan will not be working on the comics. Mike is going to solo it.
korrasami,3cuwek,MrBlaaaaah,4,Sun Jul 12 00:56:33 2015 UTC,"According to the sources I have read Bryan won't be directly writing, but he will be consulting with Mike about the story.  Bryan will be doing the art direction though.  From Bryan's Tumblr post, ""I’ve been working on the story with Mike, and I’ll be consulting on the art (once we secure an artist/artists)."""
korrasami,3cuwek,Bojangles1987,2,Sun Jul 12 01:09:25 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything you have said.  And I want to state why I will not care about the quality of the writing in regards to the comics: I can't tell what bad writing is. I didn't pick up on Korrasami during the series. At all. Not because the writing was good or bad, but because I get lost in it all in such a way that I can't analyze it. Are there subtleties, sure. Do I see them? Probably. Most likely not. I'm shitty at social ques. I'm shitty at understanding the meaning of a piece of writing. And all those reasons: I don't care if it's good or bad by someone elses standards.   It will always be amazing by my standards."

Admins are shit   They're a company, what did you expect? Honestly the things they do are pretty much a non issue for the majority of end users.   And apparently the moderators of some of the other subreddits I submit to view me as a poor-man's Gallowboob.   Whats a Gallowboob?   /r/Korrasami has been one of the few I really connected with.   Yay!   I'm hoping maybe there's still a few people here who enjoy seeing the things I post and can change my mind.   I enjoy you posting stuff.   Or they might just think I should have left months ago.   huh?   If I don't get any responses in 24 hours to this post or similar ones on the couple other subreddits I'm involved with and it turns out I'm just a sad loser no one cares about I'll delete my reddit app, uninstall RES and remove my bookmarks from all browsers, and log out. I'll leave the account up if for some reason I ever need to come back and for posterity.   The great thing about reddit is that you don't have to take it all or leave it all.  Enjoy the subreddits you like. Screw the ones you don't.  There is no need to rage quit. Besides, you're not forced to be here. Do what you enjoy, obviously."
korrasami,3ciw0z,Slyfox00,13,Wed Jul 8 18:31:40 2015 UTC,"You shouldn't let anything take up too much of your time. If Reddit sucks up to much, you should ease off it a bit.

I mostly got directly to this subreddit because the people are nice and it's not all about meaningless internet points.  If there is nothing new here I'll check out the frontpage, maybe read an AMA. It can be a time suck, but it's not for me and doesn't have to be for you. But I'm not a moderator in a subreddit, don't really want to be one and so far have used reddit for about 3 months.

Look, this is the internet and without seeing and hearing people it can be hard to tell if anyone even cares about what you do.

I thought I couldn't hate comments on facebook any more until I saw the comments and related likes to homophobic and outright hateful comments.

But we can rebel as fans united to not encourage this ship.  2 reasons the ship is bad.   There was no build up to it and was thrown together last minute. Korra and Asami were just friends. Saying Korrasami is canon before that was like saying Aang x Zuko is canon. In fact Aang and Zuko would make more sense if you compare interactions but obviously it doesn't make sense overall. No one focuses on the amazing story anymore and just thinks of Korra the lesbian everytime Korra is brought up.   I am not against LGBT+ but I am against bullshit. These other people on the list at least were planned and had a better relationship build up.

korrasami,3bmuni,iamtheowlman,12,Tue Jun 30 16:52:00 2015 UTC,I don't think dark horse would be willing to show their honey moon. You might have to outsource to top cow. Of course the avatarverse drawn by stepjan Sejic is a long held dream of mine so I'm biased.  I'm actually hoping for a kindof of old school romantic comedy style thing where the both of them are trying to coordinate a date despite crazy schedules.

korrasami,3boo89,HydrogenHuman,5,Tue Jun 30 22:14:44 2015 UTC,"Fair point, but I will add that when someone says ""the writing was poor"" but they don't cite specific examples when it was bad, now they have shown they can't pinpoint their criticism.  I just get annoyed when it's just a general ""writing was bad"" argument when there is no explanation or detail about what they felt was bad other than ""their relationship was forced"""
korrasami,3boo89,chaosking121,6,Tue Jun 30 23:11:19 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna take the bait on this one.   For context, I adore Korrasami and have been shipping it since Book 2 (it's also my only ""ship""). That said, until that final scene, I never actually believed it would happen despite dissecting every scene involving both of them.   From their letters to Korra's blushing at Asami's compliments to the infamous wheelchair scene, there was nothing that ever explicitly said that there was anything romantic there. I don't buy into the ""you were looking at it through a heteronormative lens"" excuse because I was desperately looking for hints of Korrasami being true, while all I got was really just some teasing that didn't point in any specific direction.   I mean, I was elated when the finale aired, but I'll still go out and say it feels like Bryke wasn't able to write anything definitive. The final scene leaves no room for doubt that Korrasami is canon, but it isn't explicit in doing so.   That's my problem with the writing. I'm glad we got anything at all, but I do wish that we could have gotten a relationship that was addressed and not just hinted at for those who were looking for it like us. Makorra and Masami were both very explicit and had their own arcs and everything, but Korrasami is, from the content in the shows, really just a series of undertones that results in an ending that needed Word of God to convince people that it was what it looked like.   Now don't get me wrong, I'm glad that we got Korrasami and I'm even more glad that they didn't make it seem like being gay was something ""wrong"" or something looked down upon in the Avatar universe, but there isn't any real in-universe call out or acknowledgement of their relationship.   So I guess to respond to your challenge, I'd have tried to get something like a date episode done. There isn't a point in the timeline where I think it fits, which is a problem that happens as a result of short one cour story arcs. That said, in this hypothetical date episode (probably an epilogue or something if I HAD to fit it in), the question would come up of ""what are we?"" between Korra and Asami. I'd have them say what drew them to each other (Korra's strength (not physical) and Asami's endless support for example) and have them directly address things like the letters and stuff more directly/explicitly than they did in the show. They would both eventually go through the series of realizations that the audience did and would understand that their relationship is romantic (and not taboo). Then they'd frolic to the spirit portal and have some much deserved relaxation.   That's my answer, it's not perfect and I'm not even sure it's objectively better, but I think it addresses a lot of valid criticisms about Korrasami's writing. Sorry for the wall of text v_v"
korrasami,3boo89,chaosking121,4,Tue Jun 30 23:21:08 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the response, and I understand what you are trying to say; They should have been more explicit.  The ironic thing about Bryke being explicit with relationships prior to Korrasami is they were criticized for ""shoehorning"" and ""shoving relationships"" down our throats. Makorra and Masami are actually the prime examples of this.  I would argue that Korrasami was an alternative approach to writing a relationship, compared to the typical way relationships were written in the show."
korrasami,3boo89,chaosking121,3,Tue Jun 30 23:50:55 2015 UTC,"You have a good point. I'm going to also suggest that the people saying that Korrasami should be more explicit and the people saying that previous relationships were shoehorned in are actually two different groups of people. As they say, you can't please everyone. I think both of their approaches lean too far in either direction (too in your face for Makorra and too meek and silent for Korrasami).   Fwiw, I think the relationship between Zaheer and P'li is an example of their doing a relationship right. It was explicit, didn't go against what we know of characters' behaviour, it gave weight to their actions, made us care when things happened to them (you know the scene) and helped us relate to them without defining every scene that they were in."
korrasami,3boo89,chaosking121,2,Wed Jul 1 00:08:58 2015 UTC,"It's interesting to say there were two distinct groups, because I think your right.  The problem is that ""Goldilocks Zone"" of relationships is almost impossible to achieve. That would require perfect writing, which would mean you would have to please everyone, which is impossible.  This is very likely why I've never seen a truly compelling relationship in a movie, show, etc. but I felt Korrasami was an example of how you can get close to that middle ground. But others would argue it is too timid.  What's actually funny is fans criticized Zaheer and P'Li's relationship, haha.  I distinctly remember fans saying when P'Li and Zaheer kissed after the ""no more running"" conversation they thought it was forced and came out of nowhere.  So I completely understand why Mike & Bryan go crazy with fans and say ""You can't please everyone"". You literally can't, and I think Mike & Bryan accepted that after a while and just went with their gut when writing."
korrasami,3boo89,CheeseSharp,2,Wed Jul 1 00:20:53 2015 UTC,"People seriously complained about that? I don't follow much discussion threads (usually just the top comments of the weekly one for most shows) because of how unnecessarily negative people can be (and this just reaffirms my choice).   But yeah, I think it boils down to where Bryke chose to draw the line. Not everyone is going to fully agree with their choices (which is normal and expected). Furthermore, non-aggressive and constructive criticism is important (like what we're having) but ultimately what's done is done and we've got a wealth of fan art, fan fics and maybe even some new official comics from Dark Horse to fill in the gaps, which is good enough for me personally."
korrasami,3boo89,jdtran408,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:23:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah I personally feel our wish will be granted if we get LoK comics.  Since Korrsami is extremely popular now post series, I'm assuming they will write a scene in the comics that solidifies their relationship explicitly.  Now that Nick realizes fans really want it to be explicit, they will likely be much less restrictive and let the writers go for whatever they want.  Also yes, people did complain about Zheer and P'Li almost instantly after the finale.  I guess I'm the type of viewer that just accepts what is the show and I enjoy what is there, and while thinking about ""what if this happened"" is fun, it won't actually happen because the show is completed.  The comics however, well, we can pretty much have heavy breathing for months and months anticipating and theorizing what may happen."

korrasami,3blham,singoutlouise,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:38:34 2015 UTC,"Asami Equalist AU, set during Book 1. I thought it’d be fun to re-imagine Korrasami into Book 1, and let Books 2-4 continue mostly canonically from there. So unlike a lot of Equalist Asami AU stuff, they don’t end up together in this, but the pieces are put into place to justify the canon relationship later on.  Set during episodes 5 through 7 of Book 1. Expanding on how their friendship developed with more romantic text than subtext, drawing it out to a few weeks rather than days in the original pacing of the show.     Also available on tumblr and fanfiction.net"
korrasami,3bjh4n,MrTotoro1,28,Mon Jun 29 18:55:45 2015 UTC,I doubt it. Many people are ok with gay marriage but still get squeamish with kids being exposed to gay cooties.  I think Book 4 happened at a perfect time. Just look at the progression fo how korrasami is presented. First it is something that the network will allow up to a point.   But since then the pairing has become something of a minor gay icon and you can see that in how Nick markets the show. instead of having plausible deniabiliuty they now openly celebrate the pairing. And its no mysetry why korra and asami are the franchise's representatives in all the nick sports games instead of aang or zuko or bolin or mako.
korrasami,3bjh4n,calvinien,23,Mon Jun 29 19:14:32 2015 UTC,"I'm glad they didn't kiss.  Rushing into things didn't seem to work out for Makorra, Korrasami deserved the slow subtle pacing of real life love.  In media there is a tendency to rush romance. The love at first sight trope is a strange one to me, I'm very happy Korra and Asami took things slow."
korrasami,3bjh4n,Slyfox00,5,Mon Jun 29 21:02:48 2015 UTC,I see where you're coming from and I wouldn't like it either. But what I meant was that they could have established it way earlier so that at the end of book 4 it wouldn't have been rushed.
korrasami,3bjh4n,Slyfox00,6,Mon Jun 29 21:06:34 2015 UTC,"That does make sense, tho I think that's mostly Nick's fault, slashing budgets, making Bryke cut an episode. I think it was handled amazingly give the constraints."
korrasami,3bjh4n,EggheadDash,5,Mon Jun 29 22:34:21 2015 UTC,"Rather than getting a kiss at the end of book 4, I'd rather get a book 5 where you can see their relationship actually expand to the point that they're ready for such a thing."
korrasami,3bjh4n,Drowmonk,6,Tue Jun 30 00:33:21 2015 UTC,"Not really, it would still have been pretty much like we saw. Remember that this was a show that was intended to be sold internationally, so the higher-ups at Viacom wouldn't want to put something in that would make it illegal to show in some countries.  It's messed up for sure that we live in that kind of world, but that's the way things are until we as a species change it."
korrasami,3bjh4n,RebootedShadowRaider,2,Mon Jun 29 19:14:52 2015 UTC,"Ah, that makes sense. It's not cool though, as you said"
korrasami,3bjh4n,Bojangles1987,5,Mon Jun 29 19:17:40 2015 UTC,"I don't think the legal status of gay marriage in the US has any direct affect on how much Nickelodeon would have allowed Korrasami to be depicted on screen. Legend of Korra was more noteworthy in depicting a same sex couple on children's television, so not really what the Supreme Court ruled on."
korrasami,3bjh4n,AWS_Man,6,Tue Jun 30 00:25:39 2015 UTC,"If only it had been made clear that Bryke and Nick both were good with Korrasami. That ended up being the biggest issue, they didn't realize they were on the same page until it was too late. We probably would have gotten more."

korrasami,3bfvvp,gigantism,5,Mon Jun 29 00:10:33 2015 UTC,"To be fair, most of the homophobic hate have been downvoted in force.   The hate related to the literary aspects of how Bryke treated the relationship is much more relevant. When those kinds of posts are backed by that many upvotes you can't simply write them off as fringe deniers who can't accept what happened. Like them, I honestly think it could have been written much better."
korrasami,3bfvvp,karmesan_chicken,4,Mon Jun 29 06:58:22 2015 UTC,"I don't think the writing was bulletproof, I agree that it could have been written better, and I don't intend to write the posts off that had valid criticism."
korrasami,3bfvvp,gigantism,1 point,Mon Jun 29 07:22:41 2015 UTC,Fair enough.
korrasami,3bfvvp,HydrogenHuman,1 point,Mon Jun 29 07:35:28 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing about that though.  Every single post I've seen complaining that it could have been written better never have an idea or a concept of how it could have been written better.  They just say it was bad, and that's it.  To me, that's ignorable at it's best. If you can't provide a storyline yourself that you feel would have been better than how can I take your ""poor writing"" criticism seriously?"
korrasami,3bfvvp,karmesan_chicken,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:56:05 2015 UTC,"I disagree with the notion that in order for criticism to be valid the critic must provide a fleshed-out alternative. Suggestions for avoiding or expanding upon something are sufficient in my opinion.  If this is about what I said, well, first thing is I was very careful to avoid suggesting that the writing was bad. I loved what was there. If I thought the writing was bad, I really wouldn't be here as ridiculously frequently.  But I do concede that there are aspects that could have been improved.   I think the relationship could have more explicitly tapped into the larger themes of the series or books. I wish they could have delved more into the theme of modernity and tradition, and where Asami and Korra fit into that picture. A central part of every book that the Avatar's role and the age she finds herself in are often at odds. And also, I just wanted to see more Asami. Even considering time and budget constraints, I think more could have been done. For instance, giving Asami her own thread to narrate in Remembrances, focused over the time in the desert together, would have been better.  I could go on, but this is exactly the main problem I have with the resurgence in criticism, valid or not. The threads on Friday were a fun celebration of the great real-world event. I can't help but feel that dredging up these debates now, regardless of the quality, is slightly suspect."
korrasami,3bfvvp,HydrogenHuman,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:00:12 2015 UTC,"I will amend my previous comment to say that a person doesn't have to create an elaborate alternative to the story, but when someone simply says, ""The writing was bad"" that's the equivalent of a ""down vote"" on reddit.  It's a valid opinion, but it offers no substantial critique about what was bad about the writing.  Any form of writing can be improved, but the problem is just like what Bryan said about disappointing one set of fans and exciting the other set.  If Korrasami was fleshed out more and Asami was given a larger arc (which would have been great), fans would have found something else to complain about.  This is why any form of art, whether it is a movie, animated show, music, book, etc. can only be subjective when critiquing it.  I've heard some people say Mike & Bryan ""missed the fundamentals of storytelling"" which sounds to me like a way to say there is a set of ""rules"" that must be followed when writing a show.  Anyway, I haven't posted on /r/korrasami in a long time, but it did upset me a lot that 6 months after LoK ended, (and when marriage equality came to being in all 50 states) people were still complaining about Korrasami."
korrasami,3bfvvp,karmesan_chicken,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:18:51 2015 UTC,I agree with all of that. Sorry if I offended you in some way.
korrasami,3bfvvp,HydrogenHuman,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:28:47 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about it :) No offense taken at all.  I sometimes come off too passionately or seriously.  It wasn't meant to be directed at you. I was trying to say that when I read comments that say the writing was ""bad"" or ""could have been better"" I like to know what was bad about it.  You explained what could have been improved in your comment, and I was acknowledging that what you wrote was right.  So I apologize if I came off too aggressive.

korrasami,3bfvvp,Parsoleathi,3,Mon Jun 29 10:10:34 2015 UTC,Wow some people sure seem to have nothing better to do than to bash a pairing even after more than 6 months after the show ended. That's just sad.

You can argue against it all you want but it's been confirmed and just look at the picutre in the middle of the card.  The way Korra and Asami are looking at each other says it all. End of discussion.
korrasami,3bfvvp,ender89,1 point,Mon Jun 29 09:54:39 2015 UTC,"Do people think Asami only cared about the avatar? She was the only person who saw Korra as a person! At the season 3 finale, everyone in the cast comes up and says something about taking over ""the avatar's"" responsibilities, but Asami is the only one interested in helping Korra as a person recover and heal. And hell, even when they were dating, half the time mako refers to her as ""the avatar""."
korrasami,3bfvvp,PerogiXW,1 point,Mon Jun 29 10:06:48 2015 UTC,"""There was no buildup"" may as well be the free space. Really?! No buildup? Makorra season 1 gets a pass but two seasons of Korra and Asami primarily interacting with each other was nothing?  Kay."

Some because the show didn't do what they think they should have done with the show. Some because they just don't like Korra as a character or as a woman. Some because they don't like Asami. And then those that don't like it because they are threatened by the Tumblr Progressive agenda the writers pushed at the end to cover the shows faults as they see it.  But yea that bingo card fills up most their complaints.

korrasami,3be6ev,GlobalHawk_MSI,2,Sun Jun 28 11:22:13 2015 UTC,"I'm sort of wildly confused as to what you're getting at, but let me clear something up for you. Being gay isn't the result of environment or home values, its a question of sexual attraction which is defined by brain structure. There is a lot more blurriness to the line between gay ad straight, but again, you aren't going to make someone attracted to a same-sex partner by changing what sort of school they go to or who raises them. Similarly, feelings of wanting to be girly (or masculine) are different from being gay. They belong to a whole variety of identities wrapped up in the ""transgender"" label and range from people who fully transition and identify as the opposite sex, to people who just enjoy some cross dressing. As far as what marriage equality will mean for TV and entertainment, you end up seeing a lot more gay characters whose orientation have little to do with the plot. It won't be ""gay detective solves crimes while being very gay, and we have to point that out all the time and talk about how hard it is to be a detective while being gay"" it will be ""detective and medical examiner wife-and-wife team solve crimes while being bad asses and occasionally having drama with the mother in law and/or screwup big brother"". If you want to see an example of what im talking about, play mass effect. Not only is the main character allowed to pursue gay relationships (with dialogue recognizing the fact), you run into characters that just mention off the cuff that they're gay. (Stuff like the buff marine talking about how he's kinda sad because his husband died or the lady at the asari consulate trying to get her daughter to her wife's family because she's getting shipped out). Most of the time when a gay person is on TV now a days, they make a big deal out of the fact, or they go out of their way to make them slightly more stereotypically gay. As being gay becomes the norm, you'll see that go away in favor of ""normal"" characters that aren't defined by their sexuality."

I'm sure it has happened, but in general they do a bad, bad job of it, even if they have an easy template to copy. Like Game of Thrones with Renly and Loras, they took a pretty damn nice gay couple and added every stereotype that didn't exist in the novels. I don't get why that idea of the gay man exists.  Hopefully the good examples like Korrasami will start to fix that."

korrasami,3b8qcp,mattroemer,15,Fri Jun 26 21:51:09 2015 UTC,Lucky America. We're still stuck with a homophobe for a Prime Minister who won't let his party decide for themselves what they want and completely ignores the country is in support of gay marriage.

I’m really excited to be posting a spirit world vacation piece, since that’s something I never got around to. At the time of the finale, it was just too raw. I was practically drowning in emotion. I mean, I remember when Korrasami was just a wish, a dream, and the longest of long shots.  All I ever even hoped for was for Korra and Asami to be fast friends. Now here we are, six months on. Many of you have already expressed, better than I could, how the finale really changed us as people. I don’t think I’ll ever really be over how happy I was the weekend that finale aired.

korrasami,3azt0t,calvinien,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:44:53 2015 UTC,There seems to be a rather significant overlap between dragon age and korra fans.  Although I feel like Korra is more the isabela of the two of them.
korrasami,3azt0t,Drowmonk,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:33:20 2015 UTC,"Honestly Isabela is not like either Korra or Asami, but if you're going by basic build Asami is closer to her than Korra is. Korra has the right skin tone for her though so it's a bit of a toss up.  I too have noticed the overlap. And I don't mind a bit. :)"
korrasami,3azt0t,calvinien,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:58:27 2015 UTC,"Well in the early seasons Korra was the more childish and selfish of the two. (hell, even more than Isabela in some ways . Isabela would NEVER have tried to steal someone's boyfriend.)  I suppose a reason for the overlap might be that Korra has amassed a sizeable LGBT/allies fanbase and Dragon Age absolutely revels in being as gender/sexually progressive as humanly possible. Hell the latest game let you play as a transperson if you wanted.  I'm now picturing opal as Merrill."

I’d like to thank progman for his permission to create this, and his awesome beta-ing (if you could possibly beta a comic, that’s what he did).  If you’re intrigued by this tiny excerpt but haven’t heard about/read RRaU at all, by all means go read it!

Haven’t done a storyboard like this for a few years…  While reading Moksha Chapter 8, this is kind of how the interaction between Asami and the little girl played out in my mind’s eye. I know Korra doesn’t really feature in my take, but I felt like this particular scene was beautifully written for Asami. I think she sees something of herself in this little girl and so reacts accordingly.  Kind of interesting how the story has played out since…thank you so much simplykorra for your brilliant writing!!("
