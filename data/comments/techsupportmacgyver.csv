techsupportmacgyver,3e2fyf,grem75,5,Tue Jul 21 19:22:36 2015 UTC,"You can get a universal QI compatible receiver, just remove the port and solder it in permanently. Here is a 1A one.  You could also just put in a new port with a breakout board like this."
techsupportmacgyver,3e2fyf,Dances_With_Boobies,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:32:11 2015 UTC,Nice soldering! You could put a fuckload some hot glue on top of the positive cable connection to ensure it doesn't come off and short anything out. Is there btw any special reason why you didn't solder in a new usb port instead of the rc charger port?
techsupportmacgyver,3e2fyf,Dances_With_Boobies,5,Tue Jul 21 18:14:31 2015 UTC,"The contacts I soldered to go directly to the battery. By connecting that to USB I would be supplying the 3.7v battery with 5v which can only end badly. Unfortunately there is nowhere on the circuit board where I could solder any type of USB port. The ribbon shown in image 1 has the tiniest connector to plug into the circuit board, and I couldn't find another spot to solder."

techsupportmacgyver,3e2fyf,ESCAPE_PLANET_X,3,Tue Jul 21 20:05:40 2015 UTC,"Look at that connector on the board closer.  It uses multiple pins for the same thing, I see 3 of them side by side for the +5V, just blob right over all of them. You could also go right to that decoupling capacitor or scrape some solder mask off the board on that nice fat trace.   You can do the same thing with the ground, the two pins side by side, the 4 big pads for the connector, or the huge ground plane everywhere.  If you want to get adventurous you could hook up D+ and D- too."

techsupportmacgyver,3dx4a3,ClickHereForBacardi,3,Mon Jul 20 19:40:02 2015 UTC,"It's usually pluralized like that when referring directly to the blocks, not the company.  It was natural to me as a kid to call them ""Legos.""  One Lego, two Legos.  Seemed easier and less pedantic (though in my kid mind it was more simplicity than avoiding pedantry). I mean, I've literally never once heard someone refer to them as ""Lego bricks"" outside of this context, but I totally respect and understand why attention is drawn to the fact.  Side thought: Lego ""blocks"" or ""bricks"" are sort of misnomers or maybe an over generalization considering a lot of the pieces, definitely most if you consider the brick to pieces ratio in all of the sets, aren't block or brick shaped.  Edit: Heh.  The subject interested me enough to search for ""Legos"" and filter it only to results from Lego.com. and I found this relevant segment of an article from Lego.   Proper Use of the LEGO Trademark on a Web Site  If the LEGO trademark is used at all, it should always be used as an adjective, not as a noun. For example, say ""MODELS BUILT OF LEGO BRICKS"". Never say ""MODELS BUILT OF LEGOs"".Also, the trademark should appear in the same typeface as the surrounding text and should not be isolated or set apart from the surrounding text. In other words, the trademarks should not be emphasized or highlighted. Finally, the LEGO trademark should always appear with a Â® symbol each time it is used.   Lastly (sorry. I'm on a caffeine high) I agree that ""Legos"" sounds sort of juvenile in any formal context.  Like if ""Models built out of Legos"" was a post title on /r/lego, it would signify the poster is definitely not an enthusiast.  ""Models built out of Lego"" would sound better than ""Models built out of Lego bricks"".  It just sticks out like a sore thumb and is mildly distracting.    Okay, enough babbling :D"

It face planted the corner of the desk a year prior and took some damage there.  That base was originally rotated the other way around and c-clamped to the back of the desk to keep it from face planting. This kept my workspace clear of the base.

The second one has some backlight bleed where some areas show a brighter 'black'. It's 03PPY-M3B102.  Another year later when I decided I wanted matching monitors, I got the third one.  This one I can't calibrate to match the others for shit. It has a greenish tint.  On an all black screen the black is even tinted greenish. It's NTJ71-M3B101.

techsupportmacgyver,3dgyxo,dlayknee,2,Sun Jul 19 23:54:50 2015 UTC,I can only see that happening if the torque convertor can be locked like on the old old buicks.  I had no idea any other automatic had this capability.
techsupportmacgyver,3dgyxo,gyffyn,2,Thu Jul 16 14:56:49 2015 UTC,"Unless you have a manual and clutch, I promise you didn't push start it. You can't push start a automatic since there is no physical connection between the transmission and crankshaft on the motor. Automatics use pressurized fluid and a torque converter to drive the wheels. If there was a direct link your motor would stall whenever you came to a stop in drive."

techsupportmacgyver,3dgyxo,flyingwolf,4,Thu Jul 16 09:37:08 2015 UTC,You managed to do all this in just a few minutes? I'm assuming it's an automatic since you couldn't shift to neutral. For future reference there should be a way to manually unlock the shifter with a screwdriver. There should be a plastic plug somewhere that you can remove with said screwdriver.

techsupportmacgyver,3d95h9,zzisrafelzz,-4,Tue Jul 14 20:28:47 2015 UTC,"you sure could, if there is enough current running through it, it could well ignite the toothpick.

techsupportmacgyver,3d95h9,patternmaker,6,Tue Jul 14 20:37:56 2015 UTC,"But the there wouldn't be enough current running through it to ignite it unless it was conductive enough, which was my whole point.  Grabbing a number for the resistivity of dry wood from a random search result we end up with a number of Ï = 1014 to 1016 Î© * m.  Building a small toothpick out of wood with these properties, with length l = 3 * 10-2 m, and with a square cross sectional area with 2 * 10-3 m sides, that is, a cross sectional area a = 4 * 10-6 m2 , we get a wooden toothpick resistor with the resistance R = Ï * l / a = 7.5 * 1017 to 7.5 * 1019 Î©.  Choosing the lower of these values, to get more current running through it, and further simplifying the calculation by assuming DC electricity instead of AC, and assuming a wall socket voltage U = 230V, we get that the power dissipated by the toothpick would be P = U2 / R â 7 * 10-14  W  Hardly enough to heat it noticeably, even if we would decrease the wood resistivity by a factor ten, doubled the voltage, and made half of the toothpick out of superconducting material.

You risk one of those not being so great of a connection and then getting hot and melting plastic and eventually a fire.   ... But, at the whip ass amount of power (at most, 24 whats) you're demanding may not not impose too much of a load for that point of contact, and would probably get only warm at worst. Maybe.

The 12V panel can be ignored, it was a separate project but the low current made it more or less useless for my intended purpose. And all that was was 12V > 5V USB car adaptor I had lying about soldered to a socketed cable so it can be switched in and out.  I did make both projects for an Ingress event here in town, the game with its LTE, WiFi & GPS usage and the screen being on all the time chews through any smartphones battery in no time. The total cost of everything was $2.50, which is what I paid for the solar panel itself.  The most tedious part was sorting all the old/dead iPhone batteries I had yet to take to get disposed of. I needed cells that all measured > 3V or so, anything much lower would have triggered the protection circuits on each battery to cut off the cell which while that doesn't kill the cell itself, it means that the cells health was a lot less predictable - these cells went back into the collection to be disposed.   I then went and removed the protection circuits from each battery, hooked them up to a nitecore charger I normally use to charge my 18650s and charged them up to ~3.7V (~40% Capacity). After they were off the charger, I tested their voltage at the 1 & 6 hours to see the discharge rate outside of a circuit (should be tested over days, but I didn't have time; and also I should have repeated the tests with a 500mA load). Any that had any significant change in voltage I excluded from the final collection, but I kept those for other projects because as single cells I don't have to worry about balancing discharge rates.  Once I had my final selection (from originally 70+ down to 10), I double checked that they were all still +/-0.1V of each other and soldered them up together and then onto the battery bank logic board. Once assembled, I left battery bank charging overnight somewhere safe where it couldn't cause harm if something did go wrong. Using it the first time, I was holding it in my hands for the entire 6 hours of the ingress anomaly, if it were to start heating abnormally during use then I would be able to feel it and hopefully take action quick enough. After another few charges/discharges I'm very confident that it is almost as safe as any power bank out there.  Overall, I know there are major risks (or sources of entertainment) playing with Li-Ion's but with the many thousands have passed through my hands, the number that have exploded/caught fire/failed catastrophically unintentionally is 0 and I intend to keep it that way.  Now, I'll BRB while I go hook up an MOT to a few cells outside and see how quickly and entertainingly 2000V will kill them (jk, It's 1am tuesday morning, not really an appropriate time to blow up batteries.. I'll wait till the weekend :P)."

Here, have a small teaser, of when I was playing with an MOT last week after seeing the Woodburning litchenberg figures with MOTs post and tried to emulate it. The litchenberg woodburning didn't work out all that well, so I made some plasma arcs instead.  What I did in the previous video is extremly dangerous and shouldn't be repeated by anyone, I did take a number of safety precautions when I was playing with it, but still left many preventable risks and unknowns open. I'll certainly be putting a lot more planning and effort into safety when I get around to supercharging the batteries to film for the internet."

This causes higher overhead for the manufacturer, which gets passed on to the customer. This guy just took some random batteries, without any knowledge of the technology, and stuck them together with a charger because they were rated the same. This thing's gonna blow his ass up eventually."

techsupportmacgyver,3d3cq4,Enthused_Llama,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:16:25 2015 UTC,"Doesn't matter if they're matched in this application. They're self-balancing by being forced to match voltage. Worst that could happen is that one cell is better than the others and so when they all droop, it's up to that one cell to provide the power needed from all 10. It could overheat.  However. You don't have 10 cells in parallel for increased power (access to all the energy quickly), you have 10 cells in parallel for increased total energy (longer life). So, nothing bad will ever happen.  You could have taken a nearly dead cell, 1/10th the size of the others, hooked it up in parallel, and it would be just fine.  In series, without a balancer, you'd maybe be in some trouble. But you're not in series.  People throw out buzzwords and absolutes just because they're parroting what they heard elsewhere without the context or understanding to apply it to a situation. You're in every way, just fine."

techsupportmacgyver,3czgwo,wanderingbilby,6,Sun Jul 12 15:26:13 2015 UTC,Interesting!  I'd assume the improved phone capacity comes at the expense of bandwidth since it would be difficult to provide full 4G to a  heavy user load.

techsupportmacgyver,3czgwo,halcyoncmdr,10,Sun Jul 12 16:34:17 2015 UTC,"Bandwidth is complicated in mobile networks. A lot of the time the issues come from capacity for simultaneous users, not the actual amount of network resources they are using. In those cases installed a second carrier on that site can fix it (or bringing in a COW/COLT to handle the stress.

In some places there are multiple gigabit connections to the towers. In other places it's less. Or there's nothing at all and it's microwaved or ""air fiber"" linked over to a tower WITH data. You would be surprised how much this happens.   The stuff I was mostly involved in, relief trucks, emergency vehicles etc, a little BTS in the truck would hook up to a satellite with just a 1.5 MB connection.  There are so many factors. The size of the BTS (Base Transceiver Station), the location, the cost and expected capacity etc."

techsupportmacgyver,3czgwo,breenisgreen,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:27:31 2015 UTC,"You're fine. You'd be surprised how little latency there is. Satellite is the 1-2 second latency thing. Microwave is in the milliseconds. Air fibre is even better. These guys usually only have to hop at most, a mile, to the nearest tower and that really doesn't add too much latency. Also voice traffic is compressed by a huge amount. It's easier to send lots of small packets of data than it is to send lots of big packets. All your calls are these days is data.   If you're interested, this is why HD voice is difficult to roll out, the data size increases a fair bit, so larger packets = more congestion.  Most towers are over provisioned anyway because people move about or can connect to another tower nearby for relief, but HD voice would exaggerate the use. You can easily apply the argument to mobile internet. It makes me somewhat more sympathetic to at&t, now that I understand why they have to throttle better, but not really since they should be able to add capacity relatively easily with modern infrastructure"

techsupportmacgyver,3czgwo,Bahurs1,21,Sun Jul 12 07:33:34 2015 UTC,They are up high mainly to cover more area.

On crowded city blocks, I often see cell phone antennas installed on the flat rooftops of apartment buildings.  People are definitely living and sleeping just a few feet underneath. Neighbors next door are being blasted by the signal.  The long term effects of cell phone signals on people is still considered uncertain."
techsupportmacgyver,3czgwo,wanderingbilby,12,Sun Jul 12 08:11:41 2015 UTC,"I would say we're fairly certain cell phone RF has negligible affect on the human body.  We've had RF transmissions for over a hundred years and commercial broadcasts for almost that long.  Two-way radio from vehicles has been around since the 30s and has been extremely common since at least the 1970s with the popularization of CB Radio.  Cell phones themselves have been around since the late 80s and in the beginning put out much more power compared to modern phones (3+ watts vs .3 watts).  Throughout most of the 20th century and still today, amateur radio operators has been experimenting with building transmitters ranging from hundredths of a watt to over 2 kilowatts.  If you've ever talked to a ham radio operator or been to a hamfest... ham guys are old.  Anecdotal evidence at best but seriously,  there are tons of them and they all look like Methuselah.  Those are just examples of similar RF patterns.  You also have satellite television, radio, phone, internet, and GPS being rained down on your head.  Terrestrial television and modern AM/FM radio.  Commercial 2-way radio systems used by Police / Fire / Emt / private industry.  Radar systems for airports and weather research. Wi-Fi is everywhere, generally on at least two separate frequency ranges. Spurious RF from microwave ovens, CRT televisions, and other sources has been greatly reduced by modern technology but is still a problem.  I'm sure I'm missing a half-dozen other RF sources, but you get the point.  If RF radiation was dangerous - dangerous enough to be concerned about - I think we would have found out by now.  I am not a doctor or a physicist but we are constantly bathing in RF.  I'm much more concerned about getting hit by a car or having heart disease."
techsupportmacgyver,3czgwo,dghughes,2,Sun Jul 12 14:19:36 2015 UTC,"I agree with your statements.  You seem to be very knowledgable about this.   While it's true, you have a higher chance of getting heart disease or diabetes than being hurt by your cell phone.  It's that remaining 1% of uncertainty that maybe one day we'll uncover additional risks.  My old high school teacher once said to expect everybody to have their own personal computer/communication device that will let you do anything you want, will be inexpensive, and will be mainstream. That was only about 15-20 years ago and even then it was hard to believe.  Hopefully with the advancement in technology, we will have advancement in medicine that will finally solve the cancer mystery."

I can absolutely understand your and other people's concerns about the possible effects of having a live radio transmitter near or touching you 24/7.  Thirty years of R/C cars and cordless phones have made close range = strong signal a concept that most everyone understands. The how and why radiation from your microwave cooks your food, radiation in a nuclear power plant can kill you, and radiation in your tiny cell phone can reach a tower miles away...  those are more complicated.  If you really want your mind blown, look up how GPS works.  A signal that's effectively at or below ambient background noise is transmitted from a satellite 12,000 miles away and is able to be read by something as small as your cell phone.  Then, your phone uses the difference in timing between several of those signals (differences caused by freaking Relativity to determine where you are on an XYZ coordinate grid of the planet.  Craziness."

techsupportmacgyver,3cxcms,ProtoDong,5,Sat Jul 11 20:56:08 2015 UTC,This has nothing to do with traffic prioritization.  This is due to the route to whatever testing server they are using.  Hosting a speed testing server on shit-tier service isn't going to give you decent results.

techsupportmacgyver,3cxcms,johnnyprimus,6,Sat Jul 11 23:48:43 2015 UTC,Many VPNs can and do compress data. When using things like speedtest the sent data is not random and is easily compressed. It is not unusual to see speedtest results over VPN far exceed what your connection is rated for. This is a result of compression. Just something to watch out for.
techsupportmacgyver,3cxcms,ProtoDong,0,Sat Jul 11 21:31:35 2015 UTC,I'd like to see proof of that because as a CCNP I can say that it doesn't check out.  You are going to be measuring the speed of the uncompressed speed from your VPN gateway to the testing server... with the extra leg of the VPN added.  Compression rarely increases throughput on short hop broadband connections as it is.  In fact it's just as likely to slow it down and bottleneck it to the compression speed.  (Which is highly dependent on the type of data being sent)

techsupportmacgyver,3cxcms,tidder112,11,Sat Jul 11 23:43:42 2015 UTC,I did a triple-take on this one.   Didn't know they got hot enough to affect their own performance.
techsupportmacgyver,3cxcms,scienceboyroy,16,Sat Jul 11 17:07:59 2015 UTC,"Heat can lower resistors' ability to limit electrical current, and since the resistors are a part of the logic matrix, we will end up with errors that need correcting, and cause performance issues.  This issues come in the form of increased processing power being used to correct the faulty logic created by resistors not functioning correctly, and can show up as visual or memory errors.  There are also safety features built in that use heat sensors that will trigger commands telling hardware, like hard drives, to slow down and use less energy to try and prevent overheating.  Heat is one of many reasons current computer technology is limited."
techsupportmacgyver,3cxcms,Riptor_Co,4,Sat Jul 11 18:34:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but it had never occurred to me that a wifi card could be stressed enough to generate that much heat."
techsupportmacgyver,3cxcms,scienceboyroy,4,Sun Jul 12 04:15:23 2015 UTC,It's a radio transmitter. It puts out a fairly decent amount of wattage.
techsupportmacgyver,3cxcms,Riptor_Co,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:22:57 2015 UTC,"Right, but most of it isn't heat (ideally)."
techsupportmacgyver,3cxcms,solarspeed,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:40:29 2015 UTC,Ideally a CPU wounding put out any heat.
techsupportmacgyver,3cxcms,scienceboyroy,4,Sun Jul 12 18:20:34 2015 UTC,The problem is not too much stress on the card but poor cooling.
techsupportmacgyver,3cxcms,solarspeed,2,Sun Jul 12 06:33:20 2015 UTC,"I've seen plenty of laptops where much busier components (Southbridge, etc.) had minimal (if any) cooling. Then again, I've also seen plenty of them die from the computer equivalent of heat exhaustion, and the others were the ones I had modded for better cooling... So point taken, I guess, but I'm still surprised that a wifi card would have an issue with this. Isn't most of its processing done by the CPU, anyway?"
techsupportmacgyver,3cxcms,tylerwatt12,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:46:11 2015 UTC,"Data procession is done by CPU, yes, but the 1st step is transmiting data, and obviously it is all done by wireless NIC, and I never encountered a card that doesn't get hot even under moderate load, be it PCI-E adater in my desktop, laptop or a USB stick one. OP surprised me too, I never encountered a system with such a poor cooling where the heat from wireless NIC isn't dissipated properly."
techsupportmacgyver,3cxcms,liquidcooledpotato,3,Sun Jul 12 14:05:23 2015 UTC,I think the heatsink is just acting as an antenna booster
techsupportmacgyver,3cxcms,tylerwatt12,2,Sat Jul 11 20:55:39 2015 UTC,"That's not where the antenna is, those black and white or grey wires are the antenna. Unless that was a joke.  Also, static heatsinks of that size are usually aluminum oxide which doesn't conduct electricity very well, this would make a terrible antenna."
techsupportmacgyver,3cxcms,liquidcooledpotato,4,Sun Jul 12 02:34:04 2015 UTC,"Oh I know the antennas are on the lid of the laptop  but, see how one of the wires for the antenna looks damaged by the fins of the heatsink? That could affect the SWR of the antenna one way or another."
techsupportmacgyver,3cxcms,liquidcooledpotato,2,Sun Jul 12 03:01:26 2015 UTC,"Good eyes! I didn't originally notice the cable pressed into the fins and losing shielding.

techsupportmacgyver,3cxcms,MoNeYINPHX,5,Sat Jul 11 20:26:41 2015 UTC,"Yea pretty much. It was a weak attempt at FCC compliance. Not really the correct way to do things, they just took the easy way out. Now you have to buy a wireless card that has been modified by the OEM of the laptop."

techsupportmacgyver,3cxcms,dicknuckle,4,Sat Jul 11 21:13:33 2015 UTC,I reckon it's because the wireless card was never tested in that exact configuration.

techsupportmacgyver,3ck82h,MrBurd,0,Thu Jul 9 02:58:51 2015 UTC,Does the USB casefan have a voltage regulator?  Otherwise you're running it at 360% its rated capacity and will probably blow something up.
techsupportmacgyver,3ck82h,MIDItheKID,14,Wed Jul 8 18:00:17 2015 UTC,"It has no Voltage regulator. The Fan is rated for 12V so it's only 150%. I'm by no means an electrician, but I think in the worst case then fan will just stop working.  I already made a one hour test run. No explosion so far. No funny smell. Fan is a bit loud, but that is no surprise."
techsupportmacgyver,3ck82h,3DBeerGoggles,2,Wed Jul 8 18:11:13 2015 UTC,"The good news is the fan also cools itself which makes this sort of abuse somewhat safer than if it were just a motor, say. But you are exceeding the rated voltage by 50% and thus the rated power by 125%. It won't cause the fan to explode but plastic could start to melt, causing a short which in turn shorts the batteries. So the actual worst case is a house fire.  Now those are LiIon batteries, so they probably have some integrated protection and so you're probably just reducing the lifetime of the fan this way. But the stakes are a little high for ""probably,"" aren't they? I'd not leave it running unattended for too long, or at least I'd short out one of the batteries for a few minutes to make sure it's safe."
techsupportmacgyver,3ck82h,fullmetaljackass,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:46:19 2015 UTC,"Haha I would never ever leave something like this running unattended. Still thanks for the warning.   I'm probably not gonna use it more than one hour per day and no longer than 30 mins at a time.   Btw batteries are completely cool. So I guess they could only be shorted when the fan breaks down.   I already shorted these kinds of batteries. (Old self build electro motor from school, basically just a few meters of wire)  They get really hot and then turn themselves of.   Still I'm not gonna leave something like that unattended."
techsupportmacgyver,3ck82h,3DBeerGoggles,-14,Thu Jul 9 09:10:13 2015 UTC,"It's ""a bit loud"" because you've exceeded the rated design capacity already, and the bearings are overheating.  Tried putting your hand against the back of the motor?"
techsupportmacgyver,3ck82h,eaglebtc,13,Wed Jul 8 18:15:02 2015 UTC,"I know I exceeded them. The noise mostly comes from the stronger air turbulence.

techsupportmacgyver,3ch1oz,NefariousHippie,2,Wed Jul 8 02:15:44 2015 UTC,Is the red part of that cord on the right the thing supplying the power?
techsupportmacgyver,3ch1oz,aspitzer,4,Wed Jul 8 02:17:30 2015 UTC,right. presumable the power is coming from something like a USB cord. The red would be the positive and the black (if you look closely and also use your imagination) is the negative.  all that is happening here is that there is a stripped power source and this monstrosity is just holding the 2 wires on the contacts on the back of the watch.

techsupportmacgyver,3cdwb9,FishPumpkin,29,Tue Jul 7 03:47:29 2015 UTC,"Good job!    You need a capacitor AFTER the linear regulator, something small like 10uF - 100uF  10v or higher would be enough.   In theory you'd also need a diode to protect the regulator from shorts, but for this application it's really not that big of a deal.  It looks to me like you connected the led directly on the AC output of your transformer, which would mean the led is subjected to both positive and negative voltages.  The 10-15v AC  you have there is not going to make the LED happy (reverse voltage wise) but in combination with the limiting resistor the led will last for a while. Anyway, just an observation, for something home made it's really not that big of a deal, you can just replace the led when it burns out."

techsupportmacgyver,3cdwb9,Derkek,2,Tue Jul 7 14:45:31 2015 UTC,"I was actually thinking about this myself. The transformer is only rated to output 500 mA, so the linear regulator should only allow 2.5 watts of power through.  But in my testing, I found that the transformer can drive more that 500 mA. It comes at the expense of output voltage, however. Under 750 mA of load the transformer output voltage drops to about 8 volts. Under 1,000 mA of load the transformer output voltage drops to about 6 volts. Of course, rectifying the AC raises the DC voltage by sqrt(2), so the true DC voltage @ 1,000 mA ends up as about 8 volts (still within the input tolerance of the L7805CV).  So in reality it will deliver 5 watts. It's probably terrible for the transformer, but it does indeed work."

While most Germans will complain a hell lot about days like today and yesterday, it's just not worthwhile to own an AC in your average household."

In the US, at least, you can buy window-unit AC' boxes that can plug into a standard outlet and cool a large room, and they cost ~100 bucks (~90 Euros) to have. If you have windows that slid up/down you can just set it in the windows, move the accordian-flaps it has out to block the extra space around it, and then run it for a few weeks.   If you get hot EVERY YEAR for half a month, I don't see 90 euros spread over 5-10 years (expected life) a big investment to be ""not worth it"".

Buy or find 2 bolts that fit the top 2, take an old 2 wire electrical cord, cut the ends off, separate the 2 wires (just cut the 'bridge' in the middle then pull them apart), size the wire so that a few inches removed from both ends and hanging from a center point it won't be seen, strip a few inches of wire at both ends, wrap the wires around the bolts several times, tighten the bolts snug, hang monitor from wall mounted bolt (use a sturdy drywall mounting bolt).

techsupportmacgyver,3bjqqs,BloodyIron,8,Thu Jul 2 20:14:52 2015 UTC,I actually used a fork as an antenna once. It worked pretty well.
techsupportmacgyver,3bjqqs,CatapultJohnson,18,Mon Jun 29 21:18:03 2015 UTC,Modern TVs still use antennas?
techsupportmacgyver,3bjqqs,GOTradeAutoMod,52,Mon Jun 29 20:50:53 2015 UTC,Free over the air HD channels. It's how I watch football games.
techsupportmacgyver,3bjqqs,wolfador,26,Mon Jun 29 21:06:58 2015 UTC,"and the quality of the HD signals over the air is just about spot-on with cable/satellite [basically, everything is compressed to shit]"

techsupportmacgyver,3bjqqs,tvtb,8,Mon Jun 29 22:37:12 2015 UTC,Doing compression with sporting events.. it's amazing the difference from the 1.5G signal I get compressed down to 41ish meg..and then to see it come back to my on DTV about 10 seconds later at 1-3 is painful
techsupportmacgyver,3bjqqs,Shadax,5,Mon Jun 29 22:39:22 2015 UTC,"Yep. Over-the-air digital channels look better than HD cable. Sounds impossible if you didn't even know modern TVs used antennas, but it's true."

It's not actually an antenna with HDMI output. You would be buying an antenna and an ATSC tuner. The antenna would still have a coaxial output, which would run into a tuner box (so you can tune/change stations), then out to the TV. Although just about any HDTV sold in almost the past 10 years will have an ATSC tuner in it."

And some people live too far from the nearest city to get the stations. Where I'm at I have a 35 foot tower with a deep fringe antenna. If it didn't come with the house, I wouldn't have bothered with the huge cost of installing one.  Is it needed? No, but neither is a television. However if you want to watch certain programs, then cable or satellite is needed, especially if you're too far to receive the OTA broadcasts."

techsupportmacgyver,3bgj53,Tury345,5,Mon Jun 29 15:55:32 2015 UTC,You could spend like 50 bucks on a pc water radiator and you would not have to replace the ice pack. Would of course not be so cold. Also a scrap laptop power brick and some adopters for the pump and it could all be attached to the chair.  Nice work though that's I may consider that myself.
techsupportmacgyver,3bgj53,axloo7,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:18:15 2015 UTC,Then put the entire reservoir in a mini fridge with holes cut in it for the tubing to run in and out.
techsupportmacgyver,3bgj53,ComputersByte,2,Mon Jun 29 18:00:52 2015 UTC,Mini fridge would jot be able to keep up with the thermal input. There only ment to keep old things cold.
techsupportmacgyver,3bgj53,axloo7,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:34:33 2015 UTC,"That depends on how hot the water is getting.  It wouldn't be a perfect solution obviously, but this is /r/techsupportmacgyver, not /r/techsupportperfection.  The water likely isn't picking up so much heat that it'll tons of cooling from the fridge, it's more there just to keep it from getting hot over time.  It wouldn't likely be terribly efficient though."
techsupportmacgyver,3bgj53,ComputersByte,2,Mon Jun 29 18:48:03 2015 UTC,True. If I where to do this I would use a diferent solution to cool the chair. I was thinking of a cloth cover with a thin bag of sorts right under the cloth to better remove heat.
techsupportmacgyver,3bgj53,axloo7,2,Mon Jun 29 19:42:55 2015 UTC,"An under-counter fridge would be better, more room for a larger reservoir so a bigger thermal mass to dump body heat into which would slow the temperature increase of the reservoir.  A speed control on the pump, or a valve controlled bypass loop would allow you to tune it between fast cooling but quickly running out of cooling water and less effective but longer lasting cooling.  It'd also help reduce the noise of the pump if it was inside the fridge.    I've been thinking about doing something similar in order to cool my Axoltl tank over the summer without having to spend a fortune on a tank cooler or run a massive bank of evaporation fans."

Even if it's a multi-rail psu that has low current on the 12v rail the sata ports use, the card probably only draws like 10A.  The only problem would be if he's connected the 5v and 3.3, then plugs the adapter into a sata power port that does have a 3.3 line. That's when he'll have problems."
techsupportmacgyver,3b4qr7,pseudolobster,22,Fri Jun 26 00:30:31 2015 UTC,"Each pin of a SATA power connector is designed to carry 1.5A of power. So even under ideal conditions this connector is only good for 4.5A tops. I really wouldn't trust it with a graphics card.  EDIT: Closer inspection of the image reveals that the graphics card is an AMD/ATI Radeon 5770. The maximal power consumption for the card is around 115W, of which a PCI-E slot should provide 75W, meaning that the external power connector will need to provide 40W. So the connector will need to accommodate approximately 3.33A @ 12V.  Theoretically speaking this should be fine. But after the horror stories I've seen with SATA connectors melting into pools of molten slag I wouldn't risk it personally! :P"

So even under ideal conditions this connector is only good for 4.5A tops.   More like 1.5A actually. The current that flows in through the 12V rail exits through the ground rails. Since there's only a single 12V pin for the whole GPU, the maximum power that could safely be drawn is 1.5A.  Also, even if the SATA connector could handle more than that, the thin wires from the SATA connector up to the crimps are far too thin to use for something like a GPU. This is a fire hazard."
techsupportmacgyver,3b4qr7,RichB93,3,Fri Jun 26 10:09:26 2015 UTC,"The SATA power connector has three pins for each rail adjoining one another. Each one is apparently capable of 1.5A max. But agreed on the wire thickness, it does pose a hazard."

techsupportmacgyver,3ai9ev,517634,5,Sun Jun 21 07:49:07 2015 UTC,Actually that's one of the reasons they got the plug in the first place. For the longest time Brazil didn't have a standard at all so each home basically had different sockets. The type N plug was supposed to be the European standard but it didn't catch on due to the large cost of replacing every socket to fit a type N and to have manufactures of the local countries to create yet another type of plug to accommodate the new socket.  When Brazil finally decided they wanted to standardize they decided to take the most advanced plug in the world at the time (and still I assume) and standardize on that.  It takes most of the safety features of the British socket and simply puts them in a much smaller and cheaper package.
techsupportmacgyver,3ai9ev,Purplegill10,3,Sun Jun 21 08:13:31 2015 UTC,It looks like the one from Switzerland
techsupportmacgyver,3ai9ev,h0och,1 point,Sun Jun 21 08:27:32 2015 UTC,"Yup, but it's slightly different. They mention that the Swiss one has a differently-placed ground pin compared to the Brazilian."
techsupportmacgyver,3ai9ev,Purplegill10,2,Sun Jun 21 08:31:49 2015 UTC,"Brazilâs standardization on one single plug and socket type, however, does entail some risks. Why? Simply because Brazil is one of the very few countries that does not have a standard voltage, but at the same time it has only one official type of socket! In other words, you cannot tell the difference between a 220 V and a 127 V socket! (Click here for an exhaustive list of all 27 Brazilian federative units and their respective voltages.) Most states use 127 V electricity, but a couple of them are on 220 V. This means that a 127 V hairdryer bought in the state of Minas Gerais will be destroyed when plugged into a compatible 220 V socket in Distrito Federal!    Nice try, but nope."
techsupportmacgyver,3ai9ev,doorknob60,2,Wed Jun 24 16:23:02 2015 UTC,What do you mean by that?
techsupportmacgyver,3ai9ev,EpicWarrior,3,Wed Jun 24 21:12:49 2015 UTC,"In the US (and presumably other places) we have different plugs for 120v (what 95% of things use) and 240v (mostly for large appliances like washers). So you can't accidentally plug a 120v device into a 240v plug and fry it. In Brazil, it appears that they both use the same type of plug, so you don't always know for sure the voltage of the plug just by looking at it. It's a pretty major flaw in my opinion. In the US, if it fits, it generally works."
techsupportmacgyver,3ai9ev,doorknob60,2,Wed Jun 24 21:18:12 2015 UTC,"Oh, I see your point, I thought you were saying the information was false.  Yeah, it is indeed a very major flaw, but if you don't travel too much this isn't too common and voltages and plugs are getting standardized here as the time goes  Also, if you live in a 220v area, most electronic devices have a voltage-switch (although if you live in a 127v and travel to 220v fuck you)"

A 2000 W space heater draws ~8.7 Amps at 230 V, at 110 V it has to draw ~18.2 Amps for the same amount of energy.  Higher currents over shitty plugs = more heat and fire potential."
techsupportmacgyver,3ai9ev,katui,6,Sat Jun 20 22:10:49 2015 UTC,House hold outlets are generally limited to 15 amps so they tend to be 1500W heaters. There is also twice the arcing distance and more voltage to pass through you with 220V. Making it more dangerous to get shocked by if it does happen.   If there is considerable heat just from transferring power through the wires then the wires are too small of gauge for the amperage running through them. Household is generally 14 gauge wire which is plenty for 15 amps.
techsupportmacgyver,3ai9ev,FriscoGuy,2,Sun Jun 21 01:56:09 2015 UTC,Wouldn't arc distance be over r2 so a 25% increase??  Regardless arcing isn't very bad at 220v.

techsupportmacgyver,3ai9ev,katui,-1,Wed Jun 24 11:53:21 2015 UTC,"Thats misleading. Voltage isn't dangerous in itself, but is required to pass current through your heart, which is what will kill you.   A 12v car battery can output ~1000 amps.

They're not supposed to.   They are supposed to get a proper outlet installed within a standard appliance cord's distance of the appliance. Extension cords are available for temporary purposes.  The 25 watts may not be dangerous,  But  an extension cord is a long conductor with no armoring  often placed in areas where it is at risk of being inadvertently damaged.  Also, the area where the lamp is in might be an area requiring special protections on receptacles such as GFCI or AFCI.  An extension cord is capable of becoming a resistor that radiates much more than 25 watts, in the event of a short circuit,  or in the event of an  exposed conductor,  the electric shock a human receives from the damaged cord can be much greater than the wattage of the lamp.  There are materials more appropriate for long-term applications than a standard ext. cord.    That would be MC cable or  NM sheathed cable in conduit.  Or other wiring listed for long-term install."

Increasing gauge numbers denote decreasing wire diameters, which is similar to many other non-metric gauging systems. This gauge system originated in the number of drawing operations used to produce a given gauge of wire. Very fine wire (for example, 30Â gauge) required more passes through the drawing dies than did 0Â gauge wire. Manufacturers of wire formerly had proprietary wire gauge systems; the development of standardized wire gauges rationalized selection of wire for a particular purpose.  The AWG tables are for a single, solid, round conductor. The AWG of a stranded wire is determined by the cross-sectional area of the equivalent solid conductor. Because there are also small gaps between the strands, a stranded wire will always have a slightly larger overall diameter than a solid wire with the same AWG.

I did not use the balance wire in this setup, and it could damage the batteries trying to recharge via usb so you will need an 18650 charger if you don't have one already."

I guess not having to plug the piece of shit in is an upgrade, but seriously fuck this headset. I had 5 fucking FIVE of these. They all had countless software and hardware issues which were different within EACH and EVERY new series. My favourite, when the centralised logitech driver got an update which caused widespread bugs with the surround sound. So if you wanted to have the latest driver for your keyboard/mouse you had to accept that your headphones were fucked. Legacy software is only available from unofficial sources as well.   Thankfully they broke down within the warranty time, so I had free headsets for years without ever paying for them. Still fills me with impotent rage to see a product which could be awesome if they just changed minor things about the hardware and a couple of things about the software."

People still just want rice'd out peripherals I guess.   I actually owned the older version of these a few years back, and they where the worst sounding headphones I think I've ever had for how much they cost.   Terrible frequency response on the high end.  They always sounded ""muffled"" and ""dark"" to me.  Ended up switched to my AKG k240 monitor headphones I use for recording, and never buying a headset again."

I always recommend either the ATH-M50s or the AKG k240s for people who just want a good set of headphones and don't want to spend an arm and a leg.  They're easily like 95% of the way there compared to ones twice their price.  I don't think a lot of people realize just how shitty most gaming headsets are in terms of frequency response and sound stage.  As for mics, I usually just use my webcam's mic, because I'm only ever using it for voice chat mostly, it's not like it has to sound amazing.  I do have a large diaphram condenser I use for recording, but it seems overkill to use it for just like...teamspeak and skype."

I mean I feel the same way about like beats headphones.  You're paying for fashion not actual sound quality.  All that stuff.  A decent set of monitor headphones is so much cheaper and will sound so much better then a gaming headset.  Although I'm the type who likes a flatter frequency response, because I'd like to hear it the way it sounded in the studio."

Also it comes with two batteries which you can charge in the base station, so no cables.  Only issues I have with it is the price and the fact that if you mute your mic and get out of range it becomes unmuted, just like with the 930. But the range is overall much better than on the 930."

I owned the G35s, which where like the first gen versions of this headset, and 2 of my friends also owned it, all 3 of us had ours fail in the same place, on that pivoting joint.  Headphone manufacturers who use plastic for joints that are under constant stress are ridiculous.  Granted, I said this below, but I think ""gaming headsets"" in general are a fucking ridiculous gimmick.

techsupportmacgyver,3abpdt,tornadoRadar,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:55:06 2015 UTC,"A single-stage TEC will typically produce a maximum temperature difference of 70 Â°C between its hot and cold sides. The more heat moved using a TEC, the less efficient it becomes, because the TEC needs to dissipate both the heat being moved, as well as the heat it generates itself from its own power consumption.   Basically the cooler you keep the hot side, the colder the cool site can get. The differential between the two stays relatively the same."

techsupportmacgyver,39w5ax,synthead,6,Mon Jun 15 07:48:17 2015 UTC,So how many kW are you making from this 5hp motor?
techsupportmacgyver,39w5ax,RoverRebellion,3,Mon Jun 15 11:31:37 2015 UTC,"Looks like an alternator from a car (you can see the battery they are using to excite the alternator). A big one, too. Probably good for 100A @ ~12V. That gives 1200W, but they usually have a rectifier built into them to put out DC. It looks like they are using an off the shelf 500W inverter to convert the DC from the alternator to 120V AC. Pretty inefficient, and maxes it out at only 500W."
techsupportmacgyver,39w5ax,smpstech,2,Mon Jun 15 16:07:48 2015 UTC,"And considering the alternator was probably between $100 and $200,  and a Harbor Freight inverter would be probably $40, even if you got the mower engine for free, you could just as easily pick up a used 5000w generator off craigslist for $300.  There's a Generac 10kw generator that runs on either propane or gasoline, that you can buy new for $650 shipped.  And that's enough juice to run your whole house.  However, what I want to do is get the 10kw Harbor Freight generator head, and just stick it under the hood of my truck.  Then I could throw my plasma cutter in back and use it anywhere."

Store-bought generators all had wimpy 10amp DC outputs and were made for AC loads.  It went OK.  It was pretty noisy and needed more rotational inertia to make the engine run more smoothly.  The lawnmower engine runs pretty well with a blade acting as the flywheel, but when you take that away it's harder to start and just doesn't seem to run as well."

It was also referred to as Constructo or Build-O in English-speaking countries and Tecc in the Netherlands.  Unlike Erector/Meccano, MÃ¤rklin, and Temsi, which were based on Imperial measurements, Merkur used metric.  It was begun in 1920 and ran until 1940 when World War II put a halt to production. It was resumed in 1947. The private company was closed down and its assets nationalised by the Communist Czechoslovak state in 1953. The Merkur toys were made throughout the communist period and were exported all over Europe. The company was privatized by some of the former employees after 1989, but went into insolvency in 1993. Later on, JaromÃ­r KÅÃ­Å¾ bought out the company and during three years he got back the production and saved this renowned Czech toy.

techsupportmacgyver,38waik,ktappe,5,Mon Jun 8 03:00:23 2015 UTC,"I mostly like Apple hardware (Less so their software as of late), but the notion they are impervious to airflow problems is ridiculous. There are numerous manufacturers that put much more thought into it than Apple (HP Z series for example).  Temperature is the single biggest problem for Apple, because they universally sacrifice fan speeds to keep the noise down (Try updating the SMC firmware, your mac will rev them up way beyond usual limits, it feels like it's going to take off) and their positioning / size / numbers to design. An unattended Macbook Air left building the likes of Octave or OpenCV can fry your SSD. Their first Intel based Macbook Pro's could get so hot the solder on the GPU loosened. I personally had both happen to me.  Apple is seriously not in any way infallible and they actually have quite the history of bad engineering decisions as design takes precedence for them. I don't know where I read it, but apparently, there was even a machine back when they started, where they put the internal speaker so close to the harddrive that it erased data when it beeped loud enough to keep the machine smaller. Not much has changed since then in their approach."

I agree that the specs are competitive to a lower end PC workstation.  The high-ender end workstations have dual E5 Xeons though, vs the single CPUs of the Mac Pro.   Plus the Mac Pro supports literally thousands of megabytes of memory.    64 thousand to be exact, officially, 128GB sticks are available now, but not through Apple yet.  For comparison's sake, HP's Z840 workstation is configurable with 2 Terabytes of RAM. That's 16 Mac Pro's worth in a standard-sized desktop PC.  Rack-mounted options are currently at 6TB RAM capacity.    My two personal issues with the Mac Pro are:  A.Any storage other than the built-in SSD needs to be added via external Thunderbolt drives.  I'm sure NAS or SAN solutions are replacements for internal storage, but it's a limitation of the design nonetheless.  B. Apple has no hardware encryption. Filevault takes CPU cycles to encrypt and decrypt data on the fly and must be used in combination with a firmware password as the ONLY way to secure data on the Hard Drive or the gaggle of external thunderbolt drives hanging off the back of it.  This creates a measurable overhead on performance, not to mention potential for corruption."
techsupportmacgyver,38waik,CrazyViking,2,Mon Jun 8 00:56:42 2015 UTC,"All valid concerns, but you're comparing machines built for different purposes. That Z840 doesn't get graphics until you spend $3800. A very steep entry cost (if you're considering them for the same reasons). Similarly specced, they cost about the same.   I'm not defending Apple on this. There SHOULD be expansion options (like the original Power Mac and Mac Pro) for RAID, hardware encryption, etc. But you can't compare a machine built to virtualize or churn through TONS of data with an off-the-shelf, nearly turnkey, fast workstation. Let alone it being the only Apple offering.  You've got to take into account more than just specs. You'll kill the Mac Pro every time when you look at an enterprise or datacenter solution if you do that. This Mac was not made to be stowed away in a climate controlled room on a rack. It just wasn't. It was meant to be used by a normal human.  And you can't tell us the end user or client isn't mission critical. Put your sysadmin boner away."

And the OS elements were super intuitive and copied in many other platforms (iPhone's springboard). I've read that as part of their design guidelines, if an option could not be foud after 3 or 4 taps, the option or UI had to be re-thought.  I've had a many palm devices, my favorites being the Tugsten T3 and the Vx. Honestly, at least with the T3, having it paired to a bluetooth phone was like having a modern day smartphone. There was an obscure browser called Picsel Browser, which I think came with some JDM Clies that was years, halft a decade ahead of the competition, it was smooth. Here is a crappy video of a guy who side loaded it on a LD it could be made to run fullscreen too.

techsupportmacgyver,387q5q,Fulmario,38,Tue Jun 2 14:06:44 2015 UTC,"The concern should be the soldering of the cells.  On the positive end of the cell are the vents.  Under normal manufacturing of battery packs, tabs are spot welded to this positive terminal.  Then if wires or a through hole is need, soldering is done of the tab (not the positive cap of the cell).  The reason is because under the positive terminal is a gasket and a vent for release gases charge/discharge if needed.  Basically there as a safety feature to prevent pressure from building up in the cell.  So by soldering directly to the positive terminal to the cell, you've potentially damaged that gasket/valve with your high heat.  Thus gas may not escape leading to possible explosion down the line.  I've seen plenty of homemade rebuilt battery packs over the years when soldering directly to the cell like this.  Either be NiCD, NiMH, Li-Ion.  If they didn't start a fire, they eventually lead to premature failure of the cell or battery pack.

Interestingly enough before NAND flash was a big thing lots of smaller electronics items (Korg and Roland synths and samplers, the Atari Portfolio, etc) used cards that were battery-backed SRAM.

techsupportmacgyver,37vxn7,WrexShepard,16,Sun May 31 01:56:09 2015 UTC,But...why?  Is that like a ball mouse or something?  It looks like you have a perfectly fine surface under it for an optical mouse.
techsupportmacgyver,37vxn7,bbqroast,8,Sat May 30 22:07:21 2015 UTC,It looks quite shiny which seems to throw many opticals off...
techsupportmacgyver,37vxn7,senntenial,4,Sat May 30 22:23:06 2015 UTC,if I see this correctly this looks like the default dell mouse.  It is horrible on anything else than a mousepad from my experience.

techsupportmacgyver,37hho8,ratman99uk,4,Wed May 27 19:04:05 2015 UTC,sweet
techsupportmacgyver,37hho8,willrandship,10,Wed May 27 19:23:18 2015 UTC,"There's a good reason this works.  First off, there are very few situations where providing an insufficient voltage will damage a circuit. In most modern electronics, circuits are designed to pull a specific voltage and whatever current they need, so if they can't get enough voltage they simply don't function quite right. For example, having no batteries at all = 0V@0A. Shorting the battery terminals = 0V@infinity amps. Having a voltage that's too low can cause odd behavior, but generally won't break anything. (There are exceptions, as always, but they don't apply to most electronics)  The reason it's not behaving strangely is due to how linear voltage regulators work. The essential concept is that there's a circuit in place that adjusts for the following state:  If output is less than (insert desired voltage) decrease the resistance on the voltage divider from the input.  If output is greater than (desired voltage) increase the resistance of the voltage divider from the input.  (For more info on Linear Regulators)  Another type of voltage regulator is a Switching Power Supply. The main advantage of these is their increased efficiency, as they don't dump energy in dividing a voltage with resistors. However, they are less precise and more expensive. Most switching regulators will follow with a linear regulator to have precise voltage control.  (PC Power supplies are almost always switching power supplies)  A switching power supply uses DC that is switched back and forth rapidly to produce square-wave AC. This is then sent through a transformer to boost the voltage. (Transformers only work on AC voltages, as they rely on changing electrical current.)  Once the boosted voltage in AC is generated, it is rectified (forced to stop oscillating) and smoothed to produce a new, higher voltage DC signal.  In a switching power supply, there is no limit on how low the input voltage can be, assuming the circuit was designed for it. It's easily possible to generate 30V from 2V, although there will be the same (slightly less, since it's imperfect) amount of overall energy. However,  they're big and expensive, and tend to generate a lot of electrical noise in a circuit.  (For more info on switching regulators)  A linear regulator generates a very smooth output voltage, but cannot generate anything higher than the input voltage. It will also lose a great deal of power. Regulating from 2V down to 1V loses half of any energy to go through the circuit, because half of the voltage is being captured by a varying resistance. The amount of energy NOT lost (theoretically, not including any other losses in the circuit) is output voltage divided by input voltage. So, 1/2 = 0.5 = 50%. However, for very small voltage differences it's not quite so bad.  Undervolting either of these regulators just results in a lower voltage output, which will either activate or not activate the circuit they connect to. In digital circuits this can mean temporarily corrupted RAM, and various other strange states, but this is a normal state for electronics to be in when they are powered on. Once they are provided with a sufficient voltage, they will clear the garbage generated and run normally.  An important note: if a linear regulator wants to generate 3V, it might ask for 6V just to make sure it can provide it all. However, it will still put out a relatively close voltage when supplied with as low as 3.5V on the input, since it just adjusts to match what it needs. This is likely what's happening with this controller: it's asking for 5V so it can be confident in getting, say, 1.6V.  tl;dr Undervolting is generally fine even when there's not enough power, and the controller is probably getting as much as it actually needs even though it's under spec.  Edit: forgot about autowikibot, trying to get it to do it with the first one too."
techsupportmacgyver,37hho8,autowikibot,2,Thu May 28 03:24:36 2015 UTC,"Switched-mode power supply:       A switched-mode power supply (switching-mode power supply, switch-mode power supply, SMPS, or switcher) is an electronic power supply that incorporates a switching regulator to convert electrical power efficiently. Like other power supplies, an SMPS transfers power from a source, like mains power, to a load, such as a personal computer, while converting voltage and current characteristics. Unlike a linear power supply, the pass transistor of a switching-mode supply continually switches between low-dissipation, full-on and full-off states, and spends very little time in the high dissipation transitions, which minimizes wasted energy. Ideally, a switched-mode power supply dissipates no power. Voltage regulation is achieved by varying the ratio of on-to-off time. In contrast, a linear power supply regulates the output voltage by continually dissipating power in the pass transistor. This higher power conversion efficiency is an important advantage of a switched-mode power supply. Switched-mode power supplies may also be substantially smaller and lighter than a linear supply due to the smaller transformer size and weight.

The wired controller is probably almost the same inside, and it attaches to USB, so it would have to drop down 5V to 3.3V for that."

techsupportmacgyver,37ejpg,KyussHead,2,Wed May 27 15:52:43 2015 UTC,"I don't think it was necessary to hook all those 12v+ cables to the amp, I have had a setup like this for a while now and I only used the 12v+ wire from the atx wiring harness. Honestly unless that power supply has more then one 12v rail I think this was just a bunch of superfluous work. Same goes with all those ground wires."
techsupportmacgyver,37ejpg,osxdude,2,Wed May 27 19:07:53 2015 UTC,I heard a report of someone having the wire get too hot with only one +12v wire connected and somewhere else I read about the plastic casing melting so I figured why not hook them all up.   It really only took me an extra 2 minutes to strip the ends and twist them together.
techsupportmacgyver,37ejpg,codenamegamma,3,Wed May 27 19:38:06 2015 UTC,"Good. If you're bumpin' them loud, you'll need the extra wires to push the extra current draw of the amplifier.  See this chart. (We'll assume 7-24 multicore, or stranded, wire) An amp like the Alpine you used requires an 8 AWG (American wire gauge) wire, because the amp can draw almost 40 amps (!) of power. The 8 AWG much bigger than ~18 AWG, which is generally what PSUs have. 18 AWG stranded wire is meant to handle about 3.5A max. Adding the extra wires sort of behaves like one big wire, making things a little bit more okay.  TL;DR it won't burn your house down because you connected all those wires."

Just be very careful working inside the PSU or alternately tie up all the unused wires on the outside of the PSU if you're not confident about opening/clipping wires. :)

techsupportmacgyver,379gsv,khlaex,12,Tue May 26 01:27:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, some power supplies are not able to deliver their rated current if all the rails are not loaded. This power supply even spec'd a minimum load on the 5v & 3.3v rails. We tried running the power supply without the resistors and it would cut out on hard hits; the resistors solved that issue and clearly made a difference."
techsupportmacgyver,379gsv,Big_Debo,6,Tue May 26 01:39:02 2015 UTC,"The supplies that have issues have group regulation. The 5v and 12v rails are jointly regulated, so if you get a sudden load on the 12v rail, the psu bumps up the power/voltage for both 5v and 12v, and since 5v doesn't have a load, its voltage goes up faster and it triggers a protect condition."
techsupportmacgyver,379gsv,skftw,8,Wed May 27 03:38:33 2015 UTC,Was the computer power supply enough or did you need to add a capacitor when the bass hit?  Thinking of doing this myself with some old car stereo gear I have laying around.
techsupportmacgyver,379gsv,Drumsteppin,8,Tue May 26 01:49:59 2015 UTC,"It depends on the power supply you use. This one is not enough to drive the amp at full volume (I believe the PSU maxes at around 192 watts (16A * 12v). With 80% efficiency, that's ~153.6 watts average delivered to the sub. It will perform a bit better due to caps in the power supply & amp.), but even so it hits rather nicely."

techsupportmacgyver,379gsv,SoundPon3,4,Tue May 26 06:12:00 2015 UTC,"Yep. So i have 4 8"" Jaycar woofers in a box I built that is 1000x250x400(maybe 300) exterior with 16mm mdf with a L shaped 20x10x500 port (not sure on the 500, may be more or less). The woofers are 8ohm, in parallel so it is running in 2ohm off a 1500w@1ohm VSA monoblock amp. The amp is powered by a 20 amp power supply like that one, with the ground wire disconnected because of a ground loop hum. Dodgy, yes, but meh. Also a shorted RCA plug is on the unused amplifier input because it eliminates the majority of the other hum.  I used a box calculator to calculate a tuned box (its tuned to 30ish hz) and im not particularly sure on the depth of the port or the box, but I know the front is 250x1000, but if you use 8"" woofers, consider going 270, they barely fit in.

techsupportmacgyver,379gsv,LoganPhyve,6,Tue May 26 12:22:18 2015 UTC,Any particular reason why you chose to go this way rather than simply hooking up the box/sub to a regular home theatre amp? (I suspect really just for the fact that this was cheap; just wondering.)
techsupportmacgyver,379gsv,ltkernelsanders,1 point,Tue May 26 16:04:35 2015 UTC,"Having done much the same thing, probably because those were the parts that were lying about the house at the time.  Perhaps it's because they're supposed to make themselves heard while tucked away in the back of a car, but whatever the reason, they need surprisingly little power to fill a room. Like, really surprisingly little power. A small amp and an extremely modest power supply are more than enough unless you're trying to rattle things off the shelves. Even a tiny 12V 3-5A power supply (the kind you might use to power a desktop monitor, or maybe that external hard drive enclosure) would even do the trick for normal listening levels."

Its not an attack on him personally but his portions of the videos just feel so cringy.  Same with the Tek Syndicate guy.  I saw a recent video and he casually says ""I could probably run i3 WM"" and pronounces GNOME the wrong way.  He speaks with such authority but has almost no idea what hes talking about.  (But I really like his partner).  I'm not hardcore Linux guy at all either, but it bothers me that there aren't many mainstream youtubers in tech that actually know half the crap their talking about.

techsupportmacgyver,36vpg3,dino0986,-1,Fri May 22 17:23:57 2015 UTC,"It is, you can slightly see it just above the base of the card."
techsupportmacgyver,36vpg3,irock168,12,Fri May 22 19:59:21 2015 UTC,"The card that OP put in the computer is a 1x pcie device. It will work in any PCIE slot, but it it was built to fit in the smaller slot at the top of the image.   PCIE stuff is actually compatible with any slot, you could put a video card into a smaller port if you really wanted. But its generally a good idea to use the right tool for the job."
techsupportmacgyver,36vpg3,dino0986,6,Fri May 22 20:58:05 2015 UTC,"No, it really doesn't make a difference how many lanes the slot has for a 1x device. The slot is not designed to be structurally supportive of a card, so OP putting it in a 16x slot and placing a USB stick underneath to hold it up is much brighter an idea than putting it in a 1x slot, since it is the bottom slot on the motherboard.  Many high end workstation motherboards (such as the 2006-2012 Mac Pro models) actually only have full width slots."

techsupportmacgyver,36vpg3,crysisnotaverted,3,Fri May 22 21:47:56 2015 UTC,"For this reason, I would've (and have done in the past) used a PCIe x1 slot and zip tied one of the screw holes to the metal bar that goes between two PCIe slots on the case instead.  No chance of it shorting, and the card is much less likely to become unplugged when inserting or removing a USB device because it's actually being held in place."

techsupportmacgyver,36skmq,CarVac,1 point,Thu May 28 17:02:50 2015 UTC,What do you mean you turn them off? I thought they are also cooling your PC? And how did the whole thing help with cleanliness? Is dust not setting upon things in your home anymore?
techsupportmacgyver,36skmq,redditors_r_manginas,1 point,Thu May 28 17:11:22 2015 UTC,"The arrangement of things inside the case (non standard motherboard orientation) keeps it at reasonable temperatures when not under load even without the fans. With them off, it's completely silent except for the recently installed hard disk array which is mostly isolated vibrationally from the rest of the case.   It helps with cleanliness because all of the really fine particulates which float around the longest all get filtered out. Only the heaviest dust and fibers manage to settle out on surfaces before the computer gets to them, and those are easier to clean with a dry wipe. For reference, I calculated that including the resistance of the filter, it draws 200 cubic feet of air per minute at full speed. My apartment is maybe 20x that volume overall, for an average residence time of 20 minutes."

It opened to traffic on July 1, 1940, and dramatically collapsed into Puget Sound on November 7 of the same year. At the time of its construction (and its destruction), the bridge was the third longest suspension bridge in the world in terms of main span length, behind the Golden Gate Bridge and the George Washington Bridge.

techsupportmacgyver,368r8i,yeahimageek,4,Mon May 18 00:45:06 2015 UTC,"Hatbeard and I worked for a small local MSP and we had a pile of used parts.   I think one of the 3 boxes has something like 8x 250GB. I mean just imagine the most cobbled together parts you can think of.  This was stuff our clients were throwing away.  They were literally held together with rubber bands.  Now I'm really wishing I has some photos.  So we ran each individual box in a raid 5 config, and each one came out to about a TB of storage as iscsi.   We connected each one a Windows 2012 VM that took all three iscsi disks and configured that into one big raid5 disk.  Performance was acceptable for backups. We scream tested it quite a bit.  Pulled drives from each box, and even pulled an entire box out.  Kept running like a champ.  Except, like almost any raid5 config, it's probably faster to just restore from backup than it is to let the whole damn thing resilver.  Resilvering took 2 or 3 full days, so for that time, there was nowhere to send nightly backups to - which was not OK, especially when dealing with client data.  In the end, even though the initial cost in time/materials to set it up was very low, the cost of maintaining and time to resilver made it impractical.   But it was fun."

What they're saying is that the air flow on psus are designed to pull air from inside the case, out the back. Reversing the fan will maybe cause your psu to overheat since it's unlikely the rest of your system was designed to use a backwards than standard air flow setup. Also the filter situation you setup will further restrict airflow. Cool that you're trying some ideas out, but the advice here is that this setup won't work the way you think it will, and might also be a fire hazard if it overheats."

techsupportmacgyver,360033,Major_Ocelot,5,Fri May 15 13:24:57 2015 UTC,"Some videocards can be rather heavy, especially with aftermarket cooling solutions mounted to them, but even without, the weight of the card can put a strain on the PCIe socket and if the case is transported (LAN-party here we come) this could make it come partly out of the socket.  You can screw the one end of card to the back of the case but you can't screw the other end to anything. After it was appearent that this could be a problem, most (probably all today) motherboards got little locks near the socket so you could lock the card even better in place but it still doesn't remove all of the strain on the videocard from a heavy cooling solution.  Hence some people block up the card from the bottom or secure it from the top with strips to prevent any damage to the card.    It's actually a good idea to do if you have the problem, except in this case where he used a screwdriver - it could come loose and then he has a metal rod in his case which could cause short-circuits.  So the screwdriver is an example of how not to do it, but the lego Steve example looks like a secure and non-dangerous way to do it, especially if the lego bricks are glued together, but even if they are not the worst that could happen is that something pushes the lego bricks down and they are loose in the case, and since lego isn't conductive that is not a big deal."

For low current <5A low voltage <12v   wiring, a lineman's splice and some tape would be adequate.    Not that anyone knows how to do them anymore.  Often times, people will fail to do the splice or soldering consistently,  therefore, the wire nuts can be a better idea,   because as long as the sizing is right and conductors are properly twisted --- they are hard to get wrong,  therefore you have fewer mistakes  resulting in hazardous high-resistance connections."

techsupportmacgyver,35v5j2,SimonGn,7,Thu May 14 00:08:20 2015 UTC,"Something to which one or more power wires are connected to within a power supply.

techsupportmacgyver,35v5j2,nighthawke75,3,Thu May 14 01:00:02 2015 UTC,"Potentially, yes.  There's a limit to how much current each rail can carry.  On top of that, there's overcurrent protection within the power supply that will try to stop something from burning down the house if it has a short or something like that.   Good power supplies have overcurrent protection monitoring each rail's power usage independently, so if you have a lot of power consuming devices - it might be better (and more safe) to have multiple rails so you can spread the load.    It's similar to how if you want to power a big house, having multiple circuits, each with their own circuit breaker, is better and more safe.    Sure, you could just plug more power boards in, but at some point the fuse is going to blow - and replacing the fuse with a nail isn't the answer - it's to get more circuits and power points."

If you do it don't bother with the solder less install. Unless you end up with a .6 Xbox it ain't that hard.  Also you will have to get on #xbins to download the correct firmware since the preinstalled Cromwell doesn't do homebrew or hard drives.   Hell if you want to hit me up, I created a 700 MB installation disc to streamline all this back when I was doing these for cash.

Login there and there should be a bot giving direction on how to register and log into a private FTP server.  WHY? Because the pre-installed firmware on xchip (Cromwell) is a Linux based proof of concept that doesnt do much more than boot the Xbox. To run unsigned (bootleg and homebrew) software, you will need the xchip firmware from XBins, be SURE to download the right version.  Xbox versions range from 1.0-1.6, 1.6 being the hardest to mod, they also have differences in CD drives that are worth noting, Thompson drives are preferable IIRC, there are also Phillips drives and maybe one other.   WHY? Because of disc preference, CD-Rs are preferred by all drives, but the Thompson drive with the POT tweak can read damn near anything. Try to not use the tweak first, if you over do it you will burn the drive.  INSTALL GUIDES::::  Looks like the xchip website took the install guide down. I WILL contact you again when I get my hard drives back, I have everything saved there.   In the meantime:   Order your chip, if you can. I only know XChips so if they dont have anymore it will be a lost art at this point.  Practice your soldering technique. ESPECIALLY Desoldering, the 1.6 xbox has it's LPC port pre-filled from the manufacturer, which means you will need to know how to clean up existing solder jobs... I know some tricks specifically to deal with this on the 1.6 but general knowledge is best.  Get the right gear. You will need a set of Torx wrenches, a fine point soldering iron, silver-lead solder, flux, electric tape, 30 guage wire, and a good set of reading glasses... the ones that act like magnifying lenses.  When I get my stuff back I will contact you again."

Except someone didn't bother to double check the real-world results so all the estimated footprints shrank compared to the analog footprints (which wasn't supposed to happen) and if you end up in an area around a lot of trees or skyscrapers you end up with really crappy reception due to multi-path interference (which the ATSC 1.0 standard can't tolerate), and VHF reception (which used to be pretty good compared to UHF) went totally to crap (while UHF reception vastly improved).  The ATSC (committee) has been backpedaling for a bit on that one, and the ATSC 2.0 spec is DOA, so we're already moving on to ATSC 3.0 which will adopt COFDM (also ditching 20MbPS MPEG-2 for 26MbPS H.265).

Because of them, if I want to get either of these stations, instead of using a small $20 internal antenna, I have to use gigantic $100 outdoor antenna, and if it gets too windy the small movements of the antenna kill the signal.

ATSC 1.0 was put together in the 1990s with the thought that we wouldn't be going beyond 1080i29.97. Then lo and behold, 3D TV was a thing and the ATSC realized they done goofed.  So now ATSC 3.0 is going to not only use completely different modulation (which should allow for better reception and more throughput), but in using H.265 they can reasonably transmit 1080p in higher quality, but using up to ten times less data than before (which is a huge deal, since current HD specs have us cramming four times more data than a DVD down a pipe that's only two times bigger). And not only that, but they're putting support in for up to 8K resolutions.   We'd need some kind of decoder box?   Or a new TV. The new receivers will have to be able to deal with the new modulation (COFDM vs. 8VSB), the new codecs (H.265, probably with H.264 as a secondary option), the new data streams (like non-real-time info, and ""application"" layers for things like premium content), and the enormous new frame sizes (UHD/4K being four times bigger than 1080p, and 8K being four times bigger than UHD), and higher frame rates (with at least 2160p60 being looked at) so they're going to need more horsepower than current TV sets could dream of providing."

A TVFool report shows that I should receive about 35 broadcast channels. But, each of those channels can have multiple sub-channels. For example, the local PBS has channel 13-1 and 13-2. Some broadcasters have five subchannels.  Just like cable, most of the channels are useless crap. Being in one of the largest US metropolitan areas probably explains the sheer number of channels."

techsupportmacgyver,35ej7f,Adalah217,8,Sat May 9 17:59:31 2015 UTC,These are 4xAA batteries so it outputs 6V.

techsupportmacgyver,35ej7f,craylash,1 point,Sat May 9 17:57:12 2015 UTC,I'd be more concerned with the current draw.   Why? AA batteries can easily supply far more current than a phone would draw.
techsupportmacgyver,35ej7f,combatchuck,2,Sun May 10 12:12:00 2015 UTC,Poor wording. Meant to say for how long the batteries will supply enough voltage. The voltage needed to charge the phone is about 1.25V on each battery.  Discharged at 1-2A the voltage would quickly decrease below that point.
techsupportmacgyver,35ej7f,zhiryst,3,Sun May 10 12:47:13 2015 UTC,"It works because most phones have an internal voltage regulator that bring the voltage up/down to the appropriate level before it goes into the battery. The 5V input is not directly connected to the battery or system (most systems run at 3.3V, less for some components).   Running with a slightly higher input than 5V is inadvisable but usually not damaging."

techsupportmacgyver,35ej7f,code-,4,Sat May 9 17:14:29 2015 UTC,"Four batteries, so 6 volts with no load. As soon as the phone starts drawing current the voltage will drop by itself.

techsupportmacgyver,35ej7f,vrdeity,2,Sat May 9 17:26:10 2015 UTC,"This was for an old LG not smart phone. While not plugged into a phone it puts out 6 volts, but when plugged into a phone the voltage dropped to 5 volts. If I was going to use this on a phone I cared about I would have added a resistor or something to bring the voltage down to 5 volts on its own. The LG phone I made it for was destined for the trash bin in 2 weeks once my new phone showed up, so I did not really care enough to do anything super fancy with it."
techsupportmacgyver,35ej7f,Pimptastic_Brad,4,Sat May 9 17:56:45 2015 UTC,A resistor would be less than ideal as they limit current not voltage. But you could by a cheap 7805 regulator and be good.

WiFi is really weak and it's usually omni directional. This means a wireless router is safe. You get way more radiation from talking on your mobile phone. A powerful directional point-to-point link though? I don't know, but it's probably a good idea not to put your face in it."

techsupportmacgyver,357j6d,staticextasy,13,Fri May 8 01:34:48 2015 UTC,Ever wonder why your GPU cards face the bottom of your case? The reason is because the fans intake for the GPU. The output from the flow is on the back of the card where you plug in your video.   If the card was facing up towards the top of your case you'd intake hot air from your CPU into your GPU card. That is why your cards face down.   tl;dr Fans blow into the GPU because it displaces the heat. Cards are upside down because don't want to pull heat in from CPU.
techsupportmacgyver,357j6d,ComputersByte,2,Thu May 7 23:38:03 2015 UTC,"You may want to look at the design of video cards again, and their airflow setup."

techsupportmacgyver,357j6d,BeanoFTW,13,Thu May 7 21:57:13 2015 UTC,4 monitors. His particular card probably doesn't provide more than two outputs.
techsupportmacgyver,357j6d,TopHATTwaffle,16,Thu May 7 22:39:09 2015 UTC,Multiple displays.
techsupportmacgyver,357j6d,cirreus,6,Thu May 7 22:33:45 2015 UTC,"It's somewhat difficult to find a decent priced PCI video card to power my extra displays. I did have a ZoTac Nvidia GT430 PCI 512MB but it died on me. I bought it from eBay and it was probably used in a bitcoin mining machine. It died on me about 3 months after I started using it.  The ATI card is all I have to work with right now. It feels like I'd be wasting money on a new/old PCI card (the don't make them ""new"" anymore) when I should be saving up for a new CPU and a new motherboard that has two PCI-E slots.  For now though, it works good enough for what I need it to do. The displays that card runs (top-left and top-middle in the picture) usually display nothing more than the Chrome, Chrome DevTools, WinAmp, Notepad or Notepad++. Videos and 3D graphics are only put on the other two screens. If I do ever play a game, everything is disabled besides the 650 and the largest monitor.  For the ATI drivers I use the Microsoft WDDM generic video drivers. The card is so old that the MS drivers are newer and less buggy for use on multiple displays."
techsupportmacgyver,357j6d,Hixxae,6,Fri May 8 01:05:00 2015 UTC,It does look like you have extra 4x PCI-E lanes. There is 1x cards available nVidia 1x on AMZ (1x cards work perfectly fine in larger lanes). If your feeling adventurous you can even put a cheap 16x card lower slots if you dremel/cut out the back plastic.

techsupportmacgyver,34z4dp,david0990,1 point,Wed May 6 17:26:01 2015 UTC,"Wall plug:       A wall plug (UK English)  or screw anchor (US English), commonly called a ""rawl plug"" or dowel in British or US English respectively, is a fiber or plastic (originally wood) dowel used to enable the attachment of a screw in material that is porous or brittle or that would otherwise not support the weight of the object attached with the screw.   It is a type of fastener that for example allows screws to be fitted into masonry walls.  There are many forms of wall plug, but the most common principle is to use a tapered tube of soft material, such as plastic. This is inserted loosely into a drilled hole, then a screw is tightened into the centre. The screwing action wedges the plug firmly in place, the soft material conforming tightly to the masonry. Such fasteners can attach one object to another in situations where screws, nails, adhesives, or other simple fasteners are either impractical or ineffective. Different types have different levels of strength and can be used on different types of surfaces.

techsupportmacgyver,34vbgp,StabYourFacebook,10,Mon May 4 21:29:23 2015 UTC,"Only one issue is that, assuming you've got a 2.1 A charger on the other end, you've effectively doubled your charging time with both phones on the dock, since each is now receiving about 1/2 of it's normal charge current. (Not exact, of course, would have to measure to see this.)  Electrical principle here is Kirchoff's current law.  As long as you're okay with that, it's brilliant. If not, you could always buy one of these:   http://www.amazon.com/SK30USB-Outlet-Charger-Tablet-Smartphone/dp/B00EYCFBXG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1430790452&sr=8-1&keywords=SK30USB  There are cheaper versions available, but I would strongly recommend against using any knock off charger to charge your phone... There is a pronounced quality difference between the Chinese ones and the good ones. If a cheap charger fails, all kinds of bad shit could happen. (Tripp Lite is solid though, and has a $5k guarantee.)  Also, if your computer is charging your USB too slowly, make sure you're using a USB 3.0 port (They're color coded blue). The spec for USB3.0 is 2.1A, prior to that, it was significantly less, with first generation USB being only 500mA.  Another thing to consider as far as charging speed is the cable you're using... Most cheap USB cables are using 26AWG wire, which is adding a fair bit of series resistance to the circuit and slowing your charge down. At work, we use 20AWG cables for maximum current. (AWG: smaller number =  larger diameter wire.)"

I've had one for a month or so and it's easily one of the best phones on Verizon, so long as you're okay with a camera that's only decent (keeping in mind that ""decent"" nowadays is fantastically better than the Razr Maxx's camera).  RE your main considerations: The Droid Turbo is the modern incarnation of the Razr Maxx. The screen size is a pretty big step up from the Razr Maxx (5.2"" versus 4.3""), but the bezels are a lot thinner, so it's actually not a huge increase in size (0.5"" taller, 0.2"" wider, and around the same thickness).  As for the battery.. http://imgur.com/a/QuW05 Need I say more?  And holy hell, this thing is fast. Even if you're fine with how fast your phone is, if you try a Turbo for five minutes and go back, you'll probably be pretty frustrated at how slow it feels."

techsupportmacgyver,34hd4k,tuck3r53,6,Fri May 1 18:15:31 2015 UTC,Why did you wire up the tiny reset button and not the huge power one?

techsupportmacgyver,34i7zo,ganon11000,4,Fri May 1 11:18:01 2015 UTC,"Is there a reason you put the fan on the side instead of the top? The heatsink is designed to have the fan on top. Skin friction in those tiny channels will be much higher the further the air travels in the channels. Going straight across from the side is a much longer path than coming in from the top.  Also, the rate of heat transfer between two objects is dependent on the temperature of each, so air traveling a longer path will heat up closer to the temp of the processor as it gets further along the heatsink, and will be able to absorb less heat at the far end from the fan. This could result in uneven cooling and potential warping.  None of this should be too much of a concern at 150mhz lol, but I figured I would mention it in case anyone has the idea to put the fan on the side for more heat intensive ideas."

Take the key you need, (or just swap the keyboards) then keep the laptop around in case you crack the screen or have some other issue that needs replacement parts. If you dont want to keep the dead one, you could also take out the ram, wipe the hdd and remove that, and take out the screen. Selling them all individually is usually worth more money than the whole pc was worth, and most of the time ""dead"" or ""for parts"" laptops have bad motherboards or hard drives and are fine otherwise."

Replacing the keycap and hinge is no problem. For the membrane, you should be able to cut and glue one off a donor board.. as long as it flexes and makes contact it should work fine and be unnoticable.  If you don't have a bunch of spare donor boards, you're better off just buying a new one.  If you want to salvage this one in the meantime you could strip a key from elsewhere on the board that doesn't get used much.. It should work until you can order a replacement (or permanently if you don't mind it being ugly)"

techsupportmacgyver,34idcs,dsjksdjsd,2,Fri May 1 21:05:42 2015 UTC,I'd glue it yea. Tiny dabs of superglue on the corners. Unless you have an exact match keyboard (in which case I'd just swap it) you probably won't have a matching hinge or keycap though.. So stealing a lesser used key like ~ might be your best bet

But this is irritating because it would be such a small thing for MS to do to allow access to the SSD. Just use the same screw that holds the SSD to hold the back hatch one, no increase in thickness or weight.  Honestly, I'm surprised they are using an mSATA SSD anyway, I would think they would just put the controller and the NAND right on the motherboard."

The GPU is actually a part of the CPU in these processors, so it cannot be replaced separately. These would not be end-user replaceable even if you had unrestricted access to the motherboard. The only reason the SSD is not end-user replaceable is because there is no way to open the case and get to it.  Actually I'm glad you brought up fans, since they WILL need to be cleaned at some point; I hope there's a way to get to the fans otherwise the computer will just cook itself in 6 months to a year when the heatsinks are full of dust."

I have one that can be set to physically disconnect the ground as soon as you run on battery to protect from lightning strike or other malfunctioning devices. But with grounded UPS it probably goes like this:   The hex key finally touches the casing (at night, it always happens at night). The fault protector may trip and everything turns off. The UPS goes into battery power. Everyone in a 20 mile radius awakes to the hilariously loud beeping. You see, that the neighbor still has power because he just switched on his bedroom light. You run into your little server room (the closet where you would keep a broom and vacuum cleaner you filthy!) to see what's up. You fail to disable the alarm because you have not read the manual and there is no switch at the front exclusively designed to stop the alarm. You try to log into the server but you can't because the monitor is not working because you thought you do not need to connect it to the UPS. At this point you remember that you should install the UPS software for server auto-shutdown. You want to log into it remotely but the switch is not connected either. At this point you remember that there was a UPS cable you wanted to buy for so long but never have. You run into your basement in complete darkness to find your fuse box. Somebody viciously knocks on your door, shouts something about ""shutting the fuck up"", ""some people in need of sleep"" and ""calling the cops"" but you mind your own business because you don't have time to tell him how to shut the fuck up, sleep, or to call the cops for him, which is what he wants you to do from what you understand. It's weird, that he wants this from you in the middle of the night anyways. You finally find the fuse box, after falling over various things which you never put where they belong (hint: it's not the floor in the middle of the room). You identify the switch by feeling, which is down and push it back up. You do not notice, that it trips again because it's still dark. At this point you realize, you did not turn on the light. You run back up as fast as you can, tumbling over the same stuff again. As soon as you reach the server cabinet again, you realize, that the UPS is still beeping and the monitor still won't turn on. You have no idea, why things still are not working. Your UPS just died and took the server with it. You decide to investigate next morning and mourn the aborted downloads. The next morning you hear some hissing from the UPS You open it up and see what happened"

techsupportmacgyver,33vm6x,Barneyk,11,Sun Apr 26 06:17:01 2015 UTC,"I know static is a real thing, but I have never stored anything that wasn't in its original packaging in an anti-static bag in 30-ish years of fooling around with computers - and I've never pulled out a card or anything from my ""spare parts"" pile which didn't work, if it did work when it was put there.  I know it can happen, but apprently it's either pretty darn rare or I've gotten pretty darn lucky.  In the rare event that I have to ship something (I tend to hang on to things until they are way too old to be of value to anyone else) I'll grab an antistatic bag from somewhere and put it in there, but mostly because I don't know the conditions between the time the package leaves my hands and when it gets to the destination.  So although I think this is cool, I would probably not have put in this level of effort.  :-)"
techsupportmacgyver,33vm6x,hank91,8,Sun Apr 26 12:26:49 2015 UTC,"The thing is, most static damage isn't immediately apparent.  There might be a damaging discharge and then 6 months later you start getting unexplained bluescreens."
techsupportmacgyver,33vm6x,vzzzbux,4,Sun Apr 26 14:14:00 2015 UTC,"But forensic analysis aside, how do you really know whether something was killed through ESD failure, or something more common like simple thermal failure  I've had memory that has just gone bad a long time after it was installed, even when it was installed with ESD in mind (wrist straps, correct packaging, etc) - who knows if that was due to ESD or not  In a former life working for a network equipment manufacturer I think we broke more line cards in our lab through general mishandling and design flaws (one type of card has a particularly flimsy heatsink whose spring clip will rip the mounts off the PCB)  If possible I'll still take precautions and wear a strap and remember not to install RAM while sitting on the carpet, but I sometimes feel like the risks are overstated"
techsupportmacgyver,33vm6x,tonytaylor85,4,Sun Apr 26 15:26:20 2015 UTC,"You don't really know for sure.  And it is really hard to know if the risks are overstated or not, there hasn't been any deep investigation into it.  But I feel it is way more common that the risks are misunderstood and therefor understated."
techsupportmacgyver,33vm6x,fb39ca4,2,Sun Apr 26 16:01:33 2015 UTC,"A lot of trouble shooting. Usually more than its worth. First check the board and make sure it's fine. If it's the chip, remove from board and packaging and look at the chip under a scope. Usually static discharge causes a gate oxide of a transistor or a thin metal trace to die. Which is usually a black smudge. The discharge could also highlight a pre existing manufacturing defect. Could also take the dead chip and analyze it with a sem.

techsupportmacgyver,33e7oi,VolrathTheBallin,30,Tue Apr 21 23:56:44 2015 UTC,"DVI has the same screws that go into either side of the port. Those two ports share a similar style and have no ""click"" when inserted, like HDMI does. While it's not entirely necessary, if you hit a VGA cable just right there's a solid chance you're going to knock it loose, so they make those screws to keep that from happening."
techsupportmacgyver,33e7oi,Fhajad,31,Wed Apr 22 00:07:44 2015 UTC,"I've had a small handful of occasions when I thought there was something wrong with my screen.

Some time later I experienced the same issue, and then went back to DVI and woo! it works. Then it happens again.  Only then did I realize what the issue was. The DVI cable had fallen out of the port and was laying there behind the screen all white and square ish.  So, now I screw the cables in. Problem has yet to resurface. The cables must have wiggled loose enough to cause intermittent signal issues without falling out."
techsupportmacgyver,33e7oi,VolrathTheBallin,9,Wed Apr 22 00:29:19 2015 UTC,Yeah those pins and cables have a lot of wiggle room so they work them self's loose very easy over time.

Hell, I have a few db25 cables made in the fucking Reagan administration that are still good.  Shit was sturdy back in the day, having been adapted from enterprise or military hardware.

If someone trips on my DVI cable for whatever reason, I'd rather the cable come out than the monitors potentially fall off the desk. Minor annoyance to avoid a potentially costly accident.  Modern monitors don't have the weight of the CRTs back in the day when VGA was most commonly used, so the same logic didn't really apply then (ie. might as well screw those bitches down, the monitor won't go anywhere)."
techsupportmacgyver,33e7oi,tvtb,3,Wed Apr 22 06:17:26 2015 UTC,I'd be more concerned about cable routing if you've got a DVI cable that is capable of being snagged.
techsupportmacgyver,33e7oi,Python4fun,2,Wed Apr 22 00:50:51 2015 UTC,"Also worth noting is that it's not that hard to bend the pins in VGA and DVI plugs, whereas HDMI and DisplayPort plugs are fairly hard to bend the pins on due to the pins being flat against the edges of the connector. The ""click"" locking method used by DP and HDMI should work fine for keeping VGA and DVI plugged in (and it's generally better for a connector to unplug when there's too much force on it to avoid damage), so I suspect screwing into place is to make sure the plug can't be knocked out accidentally to prevent the pins bending/breaking."

techsupportmacgyver,33cnve,electricheat,15,Tue Apr 21 15:19:13 2015 UTC,"Relevant username. But really, It failed, it wasn't a bad NAND, it was a soldering issue, which points to manufacturers defect. Why do I say this? Because SSDs don't get very hot, so it's not as if it baked itself and the traces became disconnected. Is it likely to fail again in the same fashion? Not really, because of what I just explained.  Will it fail at some point? Sure, all drives do. But you can bet I'll try the ghetto reflow again if and when it does, which, I hope isn't any time soon.   Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying it's a magic bullet for all that ails, but it worked and that indicates the root cause, and based on the low power/heat issue, that's likely to not happen again.  Oh also, it USED to be in a laptop, which is probably why it failed (shock may have caused the connections to come loose, but I still call that a manufacturing issue, as realistically 100G's shouldn't even dislodge the circuits... well okay, maybe 100G's) but now it's in a nice desktop with no movement.  But yeah, I get your point man, it's MacGyver level, not rocket surgery!"
techsupportmacgyver,33cnve,BloodyIron,14,Tue Apr 21 15:25:44 2015 UTC,"My criticism is more that a ghetto-reflow won't guarantee a lack of defects like the one that got you into this mess.  If an extra bake in an oven was all it took to fix sketchy solder joints, they'd just bake them all one extra time and never have failures.  Also if the failure was something like the growth of tin whiskers, your solution won't have changed the likelihood of that failure mode.  tl;dr like I said, agree macguyver, and this is a great post.  Just found fault with ""unlikely to fail again"", since my experience with such reflows differs :)"
techsupportmacgyver,33cnve,irock168,9,Tue Apr 21 15:29:13 2015 UTC,"True, true! I won't disagree with you. I will simply point out that in my experience, when a reflow is needed and does the trick, it's on a device that typically experiences very high heat such as a video card or an XBOX (lol), and that, to me at least, indicates the cause of the problem is much the same as the solution. Then again, I don't have a ton of experience with reflows, I'm just an arm-chair rocket surgeon.   Also thanks for the kudos!"

techsupportmacgyver,33cnve,Svardskampe,1 point,Tue Apr 21 15:34:14 2015 UTC,Components on the lower side of double sided PCBs are usually glued down with epoxy before going into the oven. So by pressing down on them one of two things could happen.   You press down on an already glued down component. You risk dislodging a component.   Should be fine either way considering the solder shouldn't stay completely molten for long after getting out of the oven.

techsupportmacgyver,32lnr9,Skyfoot,25,Tue Apr 14 20:26:50 2015 UTC,"Lead shot are small balls of lead used in shotgun shells. They're the actual pellets. Here's a quick amazon search. #9 refers to the size of the balls.  Split shot, which is often used as fishing lure sinkers, is the same thing but with a slot cut into the middle.  Epoxy is just a super strong adhesive / sealant. It comes in 2 parts that you mix together and apply.  Nothing dangerous, restricted, or illegal."

They are small lead balls with a cut halfway through so you can crimp them onto fishing line to weigh it down. Should work just as well as shotgun pellets. I would probably glue it down inside the mouse with epoxy glue, once I figured out whene they needed to go to feel right.  Or look into the Cyborg R.A.T. series of mice. I have a R.A.T. 9 wireless one that I'm pretty happy with. They are very customizable, including up to five small weights that can be attached inside the mouse. I like a lighter mouse, so I'm not using any of them. I wouldn't be surprised if there were others out there with a similar feature."

However, in my experience it doesn't work that great and may detach again. You'll always want to baby it from here on out.  Alternatively, I am often able to find bottom bases on eBay for $20 to $30 if you want it like new.    If the epoxy doesn't work, and you can't find a base portion online for an affordable price, I've done a low tech fix before that was pretty solid. (this was on the top cover but could potentially work for a bottom as well) Basically you get some machine screws, washers and nuts of the right size to fit through your hinge screw holes (usually m2 I think), drill out through the case, and then attach the hinge through the plastic where the screw mounts detached.    I think I'd order the repairs in order of preference:  New Base > Epoxy > ghetto-hooptie fix."
techsupportmacgyver,32gzlc,BluescreenOfDeath,3,Tue Apr 14 10:49:52 2015 UTC,"If you can find it, plastic weld epoxy is what I use to fix those. You leave the brass threaded things on the screws and use them to anchor the hinge to the bottom casing."

techsupportmacgyver,32gzlc,pdeee,2,Sun Apr 19 10:54:13 2015 UTC,I own a computer repair shop.  I have rebuilt these before when I cant find a replacement part.  Take off the brass inserts that have pulled out off the hinges.  Check the fit and make sure you can force/place them back in the holes they came out of.  Get some longer screws the will fit in the brass inserts.  Coat the screw threads with a very little Vaseline and screw them into the brass inserts until they are flush with the bottom of the insert.  Mix epoxy and put it in the holes where the inserts came out.  Then use the longer screws to force/place the brass inserts where they should go.  The longer screws will help to align the brass inserts and the vaseline will make sure the the epoxy does not get into the threads and block the screws when you reassemble.  Allow 24 hrs for the epoxy to cure before you attempt to reassemble.

Once they are out the bezel just snaps off. Use a small plastic prying tool (or even your fingernails) to pry up an edge and pull the plastic snaps free. They are very similar to the way most smartphone backings come off now. Some laptops may not have the little screws at all and will simply pull off.  Once you pull the front bezel off (around the screen side) you can remove the screen from the plastic backing by removing some screws at the hinge and/or corners. Sometimes the display is stickied to the backing with adhesive but most often it just pops out once the screws are removed. If you intend to sell the display, make sure you are careful of the wire coming out of it, and don't remove it from the display itself (it is taped on) because it is easy to break the connector or the port the connector plugs into."

AAA titles from 2008 or later run below 10fps. However I have a GeForce 750 Ti that I plug in when I want to play such games.   I can play many games on Linux (Ubuntu) plus Steam. For example on CS:GO with these graphics settings I get around 25fps.   I chose the Haswell CPU because I run Linux (except when I play Windows games) and the Intel HD 4600 has full out-of-the-box support on Linux. So when I reinstall my Linux OS, everything works perfectly from the first boot.   I find that really luxurious, especially when compared to a Windows install. When I reinstall my Windows 7 I have to begin by installing the Ethernet from a CD. And then there's a whole bunch of drivers to install before I can play a game. That process feels like ancient technology.   The whole build turned out even better than I had hoped, including the CPU cooler aligning perfectly in the center of the motherboard and creating a cubic look."

techsupportmacgyver,323wdm,BaconZombie,5,Sat Apr 11 01:39:00 2015 UTC,The fact that you were getting static shocks from touching the soundcard means that it already was grounded. The reason you get a shock from touching something that is grounded is because you build up a charge from walking across the floor and moving in your chair. When you touch something that is grounded it gives your static charge someplace to go. Notice how you get static shocks from light switches and water faucets. Thats because those things are grounded. You will rarely get a shock from something as small as a sound card (unless it is grounded).  Plus having those other two exposed wires on that cable is just asking for trouble (assuming they are carrying line voltage). Please unplug that cord before it shorts.  This is tech support MacGruber.

techsupportmacgyver,31vdxd,justanotherpony,45,Wed Apr 8 13:35:33 2015 UTC,This is a cool upgrade but it does not wrap around the disc. When those things shatter they can do some major bouncing off of other parts and loosing an eye to a cutoff disc is not a fun scenario.  Use proper wrap around safety glasses when working with a cutoff disc they are cheap and a hell of a lot better then a disc fragment in your eye.  It does look like it would work great to keep from getting pelted with hot material though.

If you don't want it to be permanent, use some plain old car wax on one surface or choose a different adhesive.  Those 3M command strips are excellent and non-damaging.  Also, get some thin weather stripping or single sided foam tape to put between the side panels and frame of your case.  Put some under any fans you screw down.  If you have removable drive trays, do the same thing between the drive and the cage, but make sure to screw it in securely. Same thing with the back of your psu.  You may also seriously consider putting some of that waffle weave shelf liner under your case if it's going on a hard surface.  Use the rest of it under your keyboard to dampen the clunks.  /r/buildapc is a pretty helpful place if you need advice or get stuck."

Basically the way this works is, the vegetable oil will break down the adhesive the sticker leaves behind while the baking powder acts as an abrasive to scrub the rest of it off without leaving any visible scratches on the surface. I don't know how well this will work on a car, it would depend on the material the sticker was on, be it metal or plastic, adding salt would increase the risk of leaving visible scratches since the slat grains are way bigger than the baking powder."

techsupportmacgyver,31h321,loldinmor8,3,Sun Apr 5 21:08:08 2015 UTC,"Until I got the net hooked up in the sleepout, I ran a ~40 metre (~120ft, a full 30m reel and a 10m length) lan cable up to the owners house Internet, along a fence mind and I used one of those cable joiners too, but in a very similar fashion to OP"
techsupportmacgyver,31h321,WRfleete,9,Mon Apr 6 08:53:02 2015 UTC,"wow, i hope that was CAT 6a. the signal degradation though!"
techsupportmacgyver,31h321,Iseeyou82,8,Sun Apr 5 11:55:44 2015 UTC,"Cat5e would work, it is rated to do 1Gb/s to 100 meters.    1000BASE-T (also known as IEEE 802.3ab) is a standard for gigabit Ethernet over copper wiring.  Each 1000BASE-T network segment can be a maximum length of 100 meters (328 feet), and must use Category 5 cable or better (including Cat 5e and Cat 6).   Source"
techsupportmacgyver,31h321,Mr_Munchausen,1 point,Sun Apr 5 02:45:36 2015 UTC,"I wonder how far that cable was. Also, would that coupler add any noise or whatever"
techsupportmacgyver,31h321,Iseeyou82,4,Sun Apr 5 15:32:00 2015 UTC,It looks like a dc-102-8cd coupler.  I keep a few in my bag.  It's only rated at cat5e but in reality it doesn't degrade the signal.  You would get more interference from a florescence light or a power line overhead.  They are both premade cables and since it's almost impossible to find premade stuff over 100ft at most it's 200ft.  Since cat 5e/6/6a are all rated 1gig at 300ft they shouldn't have any issue.    The only real issue is that the weight of the cable is placed on the connector and the tape they used won't take much of it.   I would have over lapped the cables for 6inchs or so and either zip tied them or duck taped them then brought the connectors back around to couple.  That way the weight is on the cable not the connector.  After that cover it all in duck tape.
techsupportmacgyver,31h321,ganlet20,3,Sun Apr 5 18:05:07 2015 UTC,For extra flair you could use a Western Union splice but leave enough length to connect the ends then duct tape wrap to make it water resistant.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Union_splice
techsupportmacgyver,31h321,DOS-equis,2,Sun Apr 5 22:09:25 2015 UTC,Couldn't hurt but kind of moot.  If someone knows how to properly do a western splice then they know to run a string and take the weight off the cable.    They might get bonus points for flair though and someone should buy them a box of cable and pull string.
techsupportmacgyver,31h321,ganlet20,1 point,Wed Apr 8 13:53:32 2015 UTC,No I agree. It doesn't matter especially since they said it was a temp install. It's always nice to see good craftsmanship and IMO the WU splice would top it off.

It's definitely not ideal for the hard drive to be able to swing around that's for sure. The reader and writer are on the same head and balance is a pretty general term we don't use for the head. There is a skew angle, the pitch, fly height, among other things. The spindle that spins the media has a balance to it though. I would imagine it's best to have the hard drive either parallel or orthogonal to the ground. We don't really run tests where a hard drive is being held up by a shitty strap though so I can't say much about this."

I have an engineering degree and am fully aware that the output is abysmal. It's a terrible design from a fluids standpoint. I just wanted to get a small amount of air through the heat sink fins, and at that, it worked well enough to keep the CPU temps down in the operational range.  The back story: A college friend shipped his laptop to me to take a look at it, because it would slow to a crawl while he was using it. It turns out that the fan inside was broken (not spinning, and not because it was dirty. It just wasn't working) and there was a ton of malware on the hard drive itself.  So I removed the non-functioning fan and, while I waited for the new fan to show up, I ran some diagnostics and a low-level malware/virus scan. To keep it from overheating I tried this little contraption out, which worked! Then I found an end table with the removable glass top and used that until the laptop fan showed up from Amazon.

It was definitely hitting the high 80's without any fan, then it was in (roughly) high 60's with the contraption set-up. I want to say it stayed in the 50-55Â°C range with the box fan horizontal on the topless table. That was by far the lowest temps.  With the new fan and heat sink installed, I'm pretty sure it was back in the 55-65Â°C range.  In summary: Laptops should all be built with a single 20"" fan for best air cooling results."

techsupportmacgyver,30s07p,burnthills,3,Mon Mar 30 11:08:05 2015 UTC,No. A sealed container full of air or water will still dissipate heat better because gasses and liquids have fast-travelling molecules that carry heat away.

techsupportmacgyver,30s07p,odhinn178,0,Wed Apr 1 02:31:37 2015 UTC,"If it is either air or water, heat transfer is occurring through conduction, and the medium is circulating to draw the excess heat away, I would agree with you.   What OP did was put a heat source in a sealed pocket of air (an insulator), inside a plastic bag (also an insulator), inside a static body of water. The plastic of the dongle case is also acting as an insulator, as is the air inside of the dongle case between the radiating elements (ICs) and the case. Each of those layers is a barrier that presents a thermal resistance to heat transfer.  It's the exact reason why heat sinks are applied with thermal grease - to eliminate the air gaps when two non-uniform surfaces are interfacing. It's also the reason for the Leidenfrost Effect."
techsupportmacgyver,30s07p,autowikibot,4,Wed Apr 1 03:26:56 2015 UTC,"Leidenfrost effect:       The Leidenfrost effect is a physical phenomenon in which a liquid, in near contact with a mass significantly hotter than the liquid's boiling point, produces an insulating vapor layer keeping that liquid from boiling rapidly. Due to this ârepulsive force,â the droplet hovers over the surface rather than making physical contact with it. This is most commonly seen when cooking; one sprinkles drops of water in a pan to gauge its temperature: if the pan's temperature is at or above the Leidenfrost point, the water skitters across the pan and takes longer to evaporate than in a pan below the temperature of the Leidenfrost point (but still above boiling temperature). The effect is also responsible for the ability of liquid nitrogen to skitter across floors. It has also been used in some potentially dangerous demonstrations, such as dipping a wet finger in molten lead  or blowing out a mouthful of liquid nitrogen, both enacted without injury to the demonstrator.  The latter is potentially lethal, particularly should one accidentally swallow the liquid nitrogen.

techsupportmacgyver,30s07p,rundmcarlson,1 point,Wed Apr 1 03:27:37 2015 UTC,"If you look, the fluid pressure has pushed seemingly all the air into a pocket above the water level, so air insulation would be minimal. Although the small amount of air and the plastic would both be insulators, the water does in fact have a much higher conductivity than air, so it is possible for this to cool better than just letting it sit in the room.   The air in the case and the case itself are beside the point, because they exist in both environments.   Edit: As an example, hold your finger in the air, then hold it in a glass of room temperature water while in a plastic bag. After a short transition period, your finger will feel colder in the water. Its because the heat transfer rate is higher in the water, even through the plastic bag."
techsupportmacgyver,30s07p,odhinn178,-1,Sat Apr 4 22:25:38 2015 UTC,"That is absolutely not the same experiment. If I put a plastic bag over my finger and put it in the water, the layer of air between my finger and the bag will be forced out by pressure and I will have direct contact between my finger and the plastic bag.  In OP's photo, that isn't the case. It appears that the bag is too thick to collapse enough to allow the same sort of contact between the stick and the plastic. We don't know how well that bag is sealed by the rubber band, but it could also be that the displacement is minimal because the air inside the bag has no where to go.  There is a reason enclosures containing electronics that dissipate heat contain fans. By your reasoning I could wrap a power amplifier in a bag and just toss it in a glass of water and it would be perfectly fine."
techsupportmacgyver,30s07p,rundmcarlson,1 point,Sun Apr 5 00:27:53 2015 UTC,"No, the amplifier is a completely different scenario and has much more insulating air inside. It also reaches higher temps faster. This is solely a problem of heat generation vs heat transfer and based on OP's experience the heat transfer is able to outpace the generation. A full pc will not work in this same principle because the cpu and gpu get very hot very fast and the heat conduction from the card to the air to the outer housing to the water is much slower than the rate of generation. This tiny device must have a lower rate of heat generation (evidenced by the fact that op says it takes 30 mins to get too hot to work properly) and this system works well enough to prolong that to indefinite use (per his claims). A cpu/gpu can overheat in a matter of one second so obviously the issue is not the same.  I'm not just some idiot, I have taken both thermodynamics and heat transfer, as well as 2 separate fluid dynamics classes to earn my degree in the sciences. A simple system could be calculated using estimated values for the volume of air and thermal conductivity of the various materials but its far more work than it is worth since op claims this works and the final conclusion of the system would just be whether heat generation is greater than the heat transfer through the boundary or not. Based on op's claims in other parts of the comments, it seems that the transfer would be greater than the generation, which is completely reasonable and passes a basic sanity check.  Although it would be wrong to just assume this would work (because there are many instances in which it wouldn't) it is also wrong to assume it wouldn't since there are many instances in which it would work. You have no idea what volume of air is in the photo, or what plastics are being used (or their thicknesses), and you have not run any analysis. I know people seem to have a great time debunking things on here, but there is really no reasonable grounds to do so unless you run a proper analysis on it, which can't be done without data that you don't have. Although your points are sound in general, they don't seem to apply to this specific instance, based on the information given. Claiming to 'guarantee' higher heat is not only unreasonable but also unknowable without the data."

techsupportmacgyver,30lmei,JimmyTheJ,18,Sat Mar 28 20:27:36 2015 UTC,Server fans run a lot faster and have optimized throughput though. If OP knows what he's doing he'll make sure that they are completely sealed across the case to force air through to optimize suction / flow. The server cases are designed for this and will expel heat VERY efficiently. And as I mentioned the fans usually run really fast and are very strong.  The difference is that a traditional case is like a box whereas this is like a tube with a high powered fan.
techsupportmacgyver,30lmei,sirwarlord,7,Sun Mar 29 05:04:11 2015 UTC,"Yup, I see a lot of 12-15k rpm 40mm server fans in sets of like 6 all next to each other in steel brackets. If positioned right they are extremely efficient. Also loud as sin."
techsupportmacgyver,30lmei,Year3030,3,Sun Mar 29 10:52:08 2015 UTC,For a 4u that's a horrible configuration.   A 5k 120mm wall would push far more air with less noise.
techsupportmacgyver,30lmei,k1ngm1nu5,3,Sun Mar 29 11:00:49 2015 UTC,40mm would be for a 1u server not a 4U. If you have a 4U then yes you would want 120mm. Check this pic out though of a 1u the fans are in the front. There is a gap between them but this model has really high powered fans anyway. You can also add stuffing if you want to tighten up gaps.   The principle is though to create that wall with no gaps to enhance airflow and if you do that OP should be fine.

You start going into 100% workload for extended periods and the fans do spin up. Even then though it's probably only half as loud as a cheap server. Also, eBay is a great place to acquire these high end servers at good prices, you just get one version behind but it's great for testing and home data crunching."

techsupportmacgyver,30lmei,evildead4075,45,Sun Mar 29 10:52:51 2015 UTC,"The basic technique to cracking passwords is to guess passwords until the hashes match.  There are many variations on this like rainbow tables, dictionary attacks, etc, but all of them are based on the same concept of guess and check.  The result is that to find the password, you have to do massive amounts of relatively simple calculations, which takes a very long time on a CPU because CPUs only do one thing at a time.  GPUs, on the other hand, are designed to do hundreds or thousands of things at once.  Since they normally process large numbers of geometry for rendering games, they are designed to be extremely parallel and process massive amounts of simultaneous calculations.  Password crackers repurpose the parallel abilities to perform the hashing algorithm on multiple password guesses at once, so that the total time required is divided by the number of passwords that the GPUs can guess at any given time."

CPUs are designed to be more flexible in their capabilities, sliding then to perform many different types of calculations.   Think of it like this: a GPU is like a big factory full of workers that are trained to create one product and one product only but can produce massive levels of output of the product if that's rust your need. A CPU would be a few guys week are skilled in all trades and can create ANY product you need given enough time but will take longer since there are fewer of them due to the difficulty of training people to that skill level."

The smoke typically smells of burning plastic and other chemicals, and sometimes contains specks of sticky black ash. The color of the smoke depends on which component is overheating.  The name is a running in-joke that started among electrical engineers and technicians. It was more recently adopted by computer programmers. The joke's humor operates via the logical consistency of what is observed, versus knowledge of what is actually occurring. The device was operating until the smoke was released from it, at which point the device ceases to operate.

I've seen things like this cause neighborhood wide internet outages. Basically you are turning your cable modem into an antenna, which can cause an ingres of noise into the cable network. The more noise, the less clear the signal is for everybody.  When we find the house that is causing the problem we try to make contact and if we can't, they get disconnected.    This isn't just a service reliability issue. Your poor connection causes egress of cable signals. These signals can conflict with everything from cell phones to aircraft radios. Because it can  interfere with licensed radio operators the fcc requires all cable companys to perform routine searches, aka drive-outs, looking for these signal leaks.  In my office of 40 technicians, 2 of them track and repair leakage issues full time.  TL:DR Please fix it as soon as you can, just because it is working doesn't mean it's not a problem."

You may notice some blurryness but for most people it'll be fine.  VGA is analog so it will handle interference better than DVI/HDMI though.    I run VGA on only one system anymore, and that is simply because it has no other option.  It's mostly a personal preference to run VGA or not though.  If you are fine with it and no one complains, there is no reason to change to HDMI."

techsupportmacgyver,30g3l6,nimajneb,2,Fri Mar 27 16:11:57 2015 UTC,You can sell a product that is verified it works but may from time to time have issues.  If the customer wants help resolving those issues then they must purchase your 'service contract' which may be anywhere from 1yr long to 3yrs long or more.  It's usually a 1-time fee for a large chunk of change.  But for smaller customers (not corporations) it's usually an hourly rate (75/100 per hr) or more depending on how difficult it is.

Yes, I know I could have got a USB2 to vga adapter. Those max out at around 1024x768 or a bit larger because of the low bandwidth. Buying a usb3 card and usb3 to vga adapter would have been about 3 times the cost of this way.  This way I have 2 5450 video cards, one video driver and all configurable in catalyst control center.   I never really thought about it, but found out any pci express card is interchangeable with any slot. The card will just default to the highest (1,4,8,16) number of lanes available.  The 'important' part is at the front, everything behind it just moves more data.  You can also stick a 1x soundcard in a x16 slot, should you want to for whatever reason.   Also could have got a super old pci video card, rather like to have something running modern drivers atleast. Could have bought a 4 output video card, specifically made 1x video card, chopped 3/4 of a pci-x16 connector off or several other options but they were all 2-3times the price and no more useful."

techsupportmacgyver,302gkz,kkjdroid,3,Tue Mar 24 19:47:44 2015 UTC,Also the fact that there's only so many PCIe lanes available from the CPU Chipset. Some systems with 2x x16 slots will only have one of those actually be an electrically wired x16 slot. The other is usually either only x4 or x8. Newer chipsets have increased the number of lanes available but there's still only so many lanes that can be used.

Problem was, as a server, it only had a x8 PCI-E slot. It had the same length as a x16 slot, except it was only pinned for x8 (not a problem; the card will just operate at x8 instead of x16), and there was a piece of plastic that blocked off the rest of the slot.  So I took a dremel and removed that piece of plastic, thus allowing me to plug in a x16 card. It served me well for many years, and a decade later, that computer is still operational, but only when I need a sacrificial guinea pig for testing--it otherwise spends 99.9% of its time in hibernation."

techsupportmacgyver,2zwz4t,frozengiblet,7,Sun Mar 22 21:42:33 2015 UTC,There are like five things that have to go  wrong for you to be electrocuted by touching an appliance.  That still leaves four other things to go.
techsupportmacgyver,2zwz4t,AsterJ,4,Mon Mar 23 00:51:55 2015 UTC,"This is bad advice, right here!"
techsupportmacgyver,2zwz4t,onomaxristi,4,Mon Mar 23 01:07:53 2015 UTC,"More like... there are 5 things that can each alone kill you if they go wrong, the grounding plug prevents only one of them from killing you, so, instead of being down to 4, you're back up to 5.  And, I think it's more like, 2 or 3, not 5."
techsupportmacgyver,2zwz4t,MattsAwesomeStuff,5,Mon Mar 23 06:32:22 2015 UTC,Pretty sure this wouldn't work in the long run and is breaking everything slowly.

techsupportmacgyver,2zwz4t,badchip,2,Sun Mar 22 18:36:12 2015 UTC,Say I plug my MacBook's three-prong plug into a two-prong outlet with the ground plug just hanging in the air. Would that cause a problem?
techsupportmacgyver,2zwz4t,ilovethosedogs,8,Sun Mar 22 20:34:28 2015 UTC,"Knowing devices with a metal casing, they might give an electric shock of a few volts(more like a buzzing feeling when touching the metal)."
techsupportmacgyver,2zwz4t,MrBurd,1 point,Sun Mar 22 20:58:26 2015 UTC,Even if the charging adapter comes with a two-prong plug to replace the three-prong cable?
techsupportmacgyver,2zwz4t,ilovethosedogs,3,Sun Mar 22 22:20:51 2015 UTC,"Some plugs have the grounds between the two pins, so you can't drop a penny and melt things. So if it is a euro plug, it's grounded just fine."
techsupportmacgyver,2zwz4t,ZandalarZandali,5,Mon Mar 23 00:02:56 2015 UTC,The ground is there in case there is a fault and the electrified hot wire comes in contact with the metal frame of the appliance.  If you touch that frame when it is electrified and the frame isn't grounded and you happen to also be touching something like a pipe with your other hand or standing in a puddle and your circuit breaker doesn't work you could get electrocuted (although US residential voltages are low enough that you'd probably be fine anyway).  Really it's pretty hard to get electrocuted.
techsupportmacgyver,2zwz4t,AsterJ,1 point,Mon Mar 23 00:41:48 2015 UTC,So doing that 3rd-prong-in-the-air thing is no worse for health or the laptop's battery health than just using the 2-prong plug head instead of the grounding cable?
techsupportmacgyver,2zwz4t,ilovethosedogs,2,Mon Mar 23 00:47:08 2015 UTC,The third prong does not touch the battery or any electrical component of any device.  It's always connected to the frame that should never have electricity flowing through it.  Grounding the frame ensures in the unlikely event the frame comes in contact with a bare wire that the circuit will go to the ground and not through someone touching the device.
techsupportmacgyver,2zwz4t,AsterJ,3,Mon Mar 23 00:56:22 2015 UTC,"I don't think the ground gets to the laptop.  The laptop is 100% low voltage DC just like most computers.  The difference is on a tower the power supply is in the computer, in a laptop it is built into the cord."
techsupportmacgyver,2zwz4t,mynameisalso,1 point,Mon Mar 23 03:19:32 2015 UTC,Yeah I figured as much but thought it weird his laptop power cable has a ground.  I'm no expert on every laptop out there though so was speaking generally about grounded appliances.
techsupportmacgyver,2zwz4t,AsterJ,1 point,Mon Mar 23 03:28:20 2015 UTC,Afaik on Apple power supplies the ground does go to the frame of the laptop.

techsupportmacgyver,2zwz4t,ImNotPanicking,9,Sun Mar 22 22:40:20 2015 UTC,"or you could just take the whole socket apart and tape the wires directly to phase and neutral- TADAH~~  never seen a plug like that before though, it's like one of those flat, groundless europlugs but with a ground."
techsupportmacgyver,2zwz4t,legatostaccato,9,Sun Mar 22 19:26:38 2015 UTC,"The strangest thing is that plug standard is used just in Swizerland AND Brazil, nowhere else.  Basically is a polarized, grounded Europlug, similar to the Italian ""L"" plug (which is unpolarized, grounded Europlug), yet much more dangerous as the pins are electrified even when not fully inserted"
techsupportmacgyver,2zwz4t,GeneraleRusso,3,Sun Mar 22 19:55:54 2015 UTC,"Switzerland and Brazil are actually two different plugs, although they do look similar. Swiss (Type J) offset of the earth pin is 5mm, Brazil (Type N, also in South Africa I think) is 3 mm. Also, the diameters of the Swiss prongs are smaller.  In defence for the Swiss Type J though, if used properly and according to standard, the outlet has a plastic frame that's sunk into the wall so that no connection can be made with the plugs exposed, like so."
techsupportmacgyver,2zwz4t,ProgHippie,2,Sun Mar 22 22:08:42 2015 UTC,That's just like the Brazilian plug. There's a depression at the connector so it can't be energized until the plug is totally covered by it.
techsupportmacgyver,2zwz4t,sowee,1 point,Mon Mar 23 03:37:04 2015 UTC,"Don't know if you are familiar with UK-spec plugs/sockets.  The earth pin (centre top in the picture) opens shutters on the sockets so the earth connection is made first and to stop end-users inserting things into the live connections.  If you're short of a socket and common sense it is possible however to cut the plug off, strip the cable back on the live pairs and then hold them over the socket holes whilst inserting a normal plug which forces the stripped wires down into the socket.

techsupportmacgyver,2zteva,1marcelfilms,7,Mon Mar 23 07:28:18 2015 UTC,"If you were to grab one nail with each hand and your hands were wet, you'd probably die.  Edit: I'm getting a lot of people downvoting me and saying I'm wrong. I'm not. I'm 100% correct. Please see my math below: http://www.reddit.com/r/techsupportmacgyver/comments/2zteva/this_looks_dangerous/cpmd589  I'm completely correct here. If a shock passes through your heart it has the potential to cause ventricular fibrillations. If you grab a conductor with each hand, the shock passes through your heart. This is not the case if you use one hand. With dry hands, most people's skin doesn't conduct well enough to kill you. With wet hands, it definitely does.  Please, if you do not believe me, never touch electrical devices. If you do not understand that what I'm saying is accurate, you should not be anywhere near electricity."

techsupportmacgyver,2zteva,bluntmasterflash,2,Sat Mar 21 20:36:03 2015 UTC,"No, specifically using both hands, the shock travels through the heart. With dry hands, the resistance of your skin makes it so like a hundredth of an amp makes it through your heart. With wet hands though, the resistance goes way down, so tenths of an amp, or even a full amp can cross the heart.  I've shocked myself with one hand many, many times. With dry hands it tingles. With wet hands it hurts like a bitch. If you grab one wire with each hand, and your hands are wet, it'll almost certainly electrocute you; you will die.  As for the breaker, breakers don't trip until some 2000+ watts for several seconds. If you do manage to conduct well enough to trip a breaker, it's going to cause massive third degree burns."
techsupportmacgyver,2zteva,pseudolobster,4,Sat Mar 21 21:16:45 2015 UTC,"As for the breaker, breakers don't trip until some 2000+ watts for several seconds.

techsupportmacgyver,2zteva,Draco1200,2,Sat Mar 21 21:26:16 2015 UTC,Ground fault interrupters do exactly that: Interrupt current when there's a fault to ground (or some other path that isn't from hot to neutral).

At 2A, you have a 50% chance of a heart attack in 10ms.  According to this chart:   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_shock#Body_resistance  Hand to hand resistance with dry hands is about 1.9Kohms for half the population, and that wet skin is a hundred times less resistive than dry.  Using ohm's law, at 120v, with dry hands you allow 0.064 amps through your heart. With 1/100th the resistance, you allow 6.4A, which is without a doubt fatal.  So in short, I'm not wrong. You are."

techsupportmacgyver,2zteva,nikomo,2,Sat Mar 21 23:10:32 2015 UTC,"Umm yeah. It does. Well, it reduces the resistance of your skin, specifically.

Wet or broken skin may drop the body's resistance to 1,000 Ohms,""    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_shock#Body_resistance  This is all very common knowledge that's taught in the most basic of electrical courses. Am I taking crazy pills? Why is everyone saying this is wrong. It's completely correct, and it's important people know it's correct.

Convection, I'd be leary about."
techsupportmacgyver,2zu8x5,grimreeper,3,Sun Mar 22 09:33:08 2015 UTC,I figured it to be airflow-related but this is frickin' genius!
techsupportmacgyver,2zu8x5,grimreeper,1 point,Sun Mar 22 01:15:47 2015 UTC,"So um, where does the air intake come from?"
techsupportmacgyver,2zu8x5,grimreeper,2,Sun Mar 22 01:48:17 2015 UTC,There's a fan on the bottom of the case.   This is what the fan layout on an unmodified case looks like. This is the R3 it looks like he's using the R4 because of the removable section of the hard drive bay but they're pretty close to the same for fan placement.
techsupportmacgyver,2zu8x5,klendool,1 point,Sun Mar 22 02:42:46 2015 UTC,"Although having the airflow going upwards seems to make sense due to heat rising, I would recommend against having intake on the bottom of the case, as from my experience, it basically turns your PC into a vacuum cleaner.  No matter where I put my PC when it had intake on the bottom, it filled with dust almost weekly. Filters reduced it a bit, but not completely, and the dust in the filters still needed cleaning out weekly otherwise it affected airflow. Maybe you could look into adding some more ducting and pulling air in from the front or something? Then you could cool the hard drives better too.  Also, why is there a card reader mounted inside the case at the bottom?"
techsupportmacgyver,2zu8x5,pixel_loupe,1 point,Sun Mar 22 12:47:48 2015 UTC,"Maybe i should change the fan layout. Im pretty sure the two fans on the top will get dust inside them , unless i get some filter.  The card reader is there for style."
techsupportmacgyver,2zu8x5,klendool,2,Sun Mar 22 13:50:00 2015 UTC,"Is this thing going into an anechoic chamber or something? I've got almost every fan position filled if I didn't mind it going about 10Â° warmer I wouldn't be able to hear the fans at all unless I'm gaming and the CPU gets warm.   http://i.imgur.com/g1nARDT.jpg  Honestly, you can do everything you want to try and make it quiet, but your best bet will be to get a 120 or 140mm aftermarket GPU cooler and put in some Noctua NF fans or the corsair SP series of fans. Both of those are good static pressure fans which are almost dead silent unless you're pumping out heat. Also a fan controller would probably go miles for making your system quiet 95% of the time and you'll keep your system from overheating from lack of airflow.   Also, SSDs might not put out a ton of heat, but HDDs do. you need to get some airflow to them."

techsupportmacgyver,2zu40h,jacky4566,8,Sun Mar 22 03:20:09 2015 UTC,"Supercharger is a compressor, this isn't compressing anything. It is actually doing the opposite, raising the vacuum since it is just a restriction as far as the engine is concerned. Bet it would spin the fan fast enough to destroy the blades if it was on there at full throttle."
techsupportmacgyver,2zu40h,grem75,0,Sun Mar 22 04:05:23 2015 UTC,I'm actually not sure what the airflow of a car engine is. I'm sure a Delta fan (250 cfm) would be able to keep up.
techsupportmacgyver,2zu40h,CarVac,4,Sun Mar 22 15:26:21 2015 UTC,Even a 2L will pull over 250CFM at full throttle.
techsupportmacgyver,2zu40h,grem75,2,Sun Mar 22 19:34:35 2015 UTC,The math checks out: 2 liters * 1/2 displacement per revolution * 6000 rpm * 0.0353 liters per cubic foot = 211 cfm.
techsupportmacgyver,2zu40h,CarVac,2,Sun Mar 22 20:51:44 2015 UTC,"Depends on the car, but I doubt little hondas or toyotas pull that much air, even at high speeds, especially when the intake is pointing toward the ground.   For a smaller car, it might be worth it. For the car shown, eh, a hood scoop will do more."

techsupportmacgyver,2zorp5,willrandship,10,Fri Mar 20 18:08:39 2015 UTC,Damage to the eyes comes predominantly from invisible infrared wavelengths.
