I imagine it's going to be years before he's ever in a position to ""break up"" with someone, least of all being in a relationship in the first place.

fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuud,38zqdw,InfintySquared,1 point,Mon Jun 8 05:25:33 2015 UTC,"Though this post does not fit this subreddit, I will say that you should come to Japan. The labeling system in Japan is really messed up and hard to use.  For example, one product might say there are 66 calories in 100g. Then you have to search all over the product just to find out how many grams are in it. On one tiny spot, on the back of the package, you find ""305g"". So, now you have to do the math to figure out how much is in the whole thing.  But, that's close enough that you can estimate pretty easily. What's really tough are the ones that just use random values. Like there are 73 calories in 56g, and the package is 823g. You have to get out your calculator just to figure out how much you can have.  I know that the US labeling system isn't the best, but it could be much worse."

I think people really enjoyed the extra butter and started using it in all of their pizzas.  I personally like adding butter to the crust, and also having a dry crust on a slightly greased surface. They're just different styles, with one being much greasier."

Though, I do like those Tostino's party pizzas, which I cook at home. But, I cook them until they are warm and the cheese is melted and then stop. I don't like a crispy, burnt crust; I want it to be cooked but doughy. I don't know if those can be considered pizza, though. They aren't as good as real pizza, but are good in their own way."

fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuud,2e8p9y,cheekybrat,26,Fri Aug 22 02:33:35 2014 UTC,"If you want your lasagna to be saucy, then make extra sauce.  Don't put extra in the pan to bake.  Put in the normal amount, and once you have plated the piece of lasagna, ladle some of the extra sauce over the top of it. Voila'.  Saucy lasagna!  This is what Italian restaurants do."

fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuud,2e8p9y,simulations,5,Fri Aug 22 18:48:54 2014 UTC,when you cook noodles they absorb liquid.   your noodles absorbed the liquid from the sauce and left the grease and oil unabsorbed.
fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuud,2e8p9y,tunersharkbitten,11,Fri Aug 22 02:56:39 2014 UTC,"Use a shitload of sauce. The noodles are absorbing the sauce, especially if you're using the no-boil ones. Make sure you're draining the fat off your meat. And if you want to add even more moisture throw some julienned summer squash and carrots (adds more flavor, too)."
fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuud,2e8p9y,lambcaseded,3,Fri Aug 22 05:03:47 2014 UTC,Well first you should xpost this to /r/AskCulinary.  But anyway.  What kind of noodles are you using? They could be absorbing the sauce.
fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuud,2e8p9y,halifaxdatageek,1 point,Fri Aug 22 18:52:12 2014 UTC,"Yet another sub to add to my feed, thank you!  I have been using the no boil noodles.  I'm going to try something different next time though."
fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuud,2e8p9y,CanConfirm_AmSatan,2,Sat Aug 23 01:20:20 2014 UTC,"Well, that's why. Try making fresh noodles and cooking them first."
fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuud,2e8p9y,Ninjakitty07,2,Sat Aug 23 01:35:22 2014 UTC,Did you cook the noodles before assembling the lasagna?
fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuud,2e8p9y,H00T3RV1LL3,6,Fri Aug 22 02:38:51 2014 UTC,"No, I usually use the no boil noodles.  I guess as another person said, it absorbs the liquid, hey?"
fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuud,2e8p9y,Ninjakitty07,3,Fri Aug 22 03:05:14 2014 UTC,"Yes, but if you're using marinara then I wouldn't think there would be any grease, or little, grease.  If you're using a meat, try using a lower fat meat. Or draining the meat well before adding to your sauce (ie meat sauce)."
fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuud,2e8p9y,mrsmunson,2,Fri Aug 22 03:12:57 2014 UTC,"I'd say you probably have a little of column A and a little of column B. The dry noodles absorbed a lot of liquid, and if your meat wasn't really well drained, it would make any grease really obvious because it was the only liquid left. For the record, I've never used no-boil noodles to cook, so this is mostly conjecture mixed with other cooking experience and a dash of google-fu."
fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuud,2e8p9y,fine_day_today,2,Fri Aug 22 03:19:51 2014 UTC,My mom uses no-boil noodles and she says she always doubles the sauce.
fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuud,2e8p9y,Jukibom,2,Fri Aug 22 14:13:56 2014 UTC,"I always thought that's why you put bechamel sauce in between the layers...so that the pasta has also the liquid in bechamel to absorb, so there's more red sauce left!"
fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuud,2e8p9y,Sketchbooks,1 point,Fri Aug 22 14:03:02 2014 UTC,What is this talk of noodles? Is this another term for pasta sheets wherever you are or do you mean actual spaghetti-like noodles?  If you use fresh (NOT dried) lasagna sheets then they won't need to soak up much moisture.  Edit: like these
fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuud,2dlb9b,CastingNed,7,Fri Aug 15 00:32:35 2014 UTC,"Man, I like to cook but I would get WRECKED on that show."
fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuud,2dlb9b,2ndChanceCharlie,-1,Fri Aug 15 01:46:02 2014 UTC,"You should probably check out the show. Generally speaking I would agree with you, but most of our contestants have really benefited from the experience of being on our show. Luca is opening his first restaurant in NYC, Christine's cookbook was a best seller, Sharone & James have their sauce selling nationally and in Whole Foods, and several others have become executive chefs and started up their own catering companies. It really is a positive and inspirational show."

fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuud,2cdotr,sammer87,5,Fri Aug 1 23:16:59 2014 UTC,Personally I would make more mac and cheese.

Classic macaroni salad (not as light, I don't like mayo-based pasta salads but if that's your thing this one might be more up your alley)."
fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuud,2cdotr,rob79,5,Sat Aug 2 00:05:35 2014 UTC,Stick a chunk in a burger patty and grill it.  Mac n cheese stuffed burgers.  Do it.
fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuud,2cdotr,FlowersForMegatron,3,Sat Aug 2 01:41:08 2014 UTC,Grilled mac and cheese sandwiches are really tasty!
fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuud,2cdotr,MsThreepwood,3,Fri Aug 1 23:47:55 2014 UTC,"Breh. I got you. Take a mixing bowl add some Panko, salt, white pepper, and garlic powder. Give that a shake-shake, mix it all up. Now add some olive oil to that mixture while tossing it. You are trying to add the oil to the Panko but NOT, repeat NOT trying to saturate the whole shabangabang with oil..that's gross. Still with me? Good, good you are doing fine. Now take a small cupcake tin. spray/butter/oil it up rull nice and coat the inside of the tins with your Panko mixture. Now add your Mac and cheese, filling the tins with a nice rounded bunch of that business. Then add more of the Panko mix on top so its coated. Bake that shit off on low heat in an oven till the tops are golden..I'm thinking like..250? 300? I dont remember, roll with it. Pull them out, let em cool a little and take them out of the tins. Boom, mac and cheese ""muffins"".   Not cheesey enough for you OP? Fine.  Sauce pan. Two cups heavy cream, 2 cups smoked cheddar, shot of Guinness, paprika, salt, white pepper to taste.  Get the heavy cream-shot of beer mix to right before a boil...watch that shit because if it boils over its gonna get errrywhere and it will happen so fast your eyes might implode creating mini black holes, be careful of that. Once its there stir in your cheese little by little. If its not thick enough slurry that bitch. Or if for some reason you have xanthan gum lying around cause you are a boss like that, a pinch of that shit will thicken you right up. Boom, you just made cheddar ale sauce so you can have cheese with your cheese.   Enjoy"
