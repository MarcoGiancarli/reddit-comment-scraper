Hope he can do something similar to our other young strikers this season.  We are now a Goalie and a center mid away from having a very decent squad set up for next season.  The team that finished last season was only really together since February, and in that time, our form was more that of a mid table club than a bottom 2 club.  With a good preseason together, I'm reasonably confident of a top 6 finish this year and don't expect to be anywhere near the playoffs by the end."

ScottishFootball,3dyil0,TweetPoster,-2,Mon Jul 20 15:59:58 2015 UTC,BBC is saying 8 with 2 suspended

ScottishFootball,3dyil0,williamthebloody1880,4,Mon Jul 20 20:12:02 2015 UTC,"Don't really want to get into it, but the sky headline is proper use of English and it means 6 game ban, with 2 being suspended (8 total).  It means exactly what its supposed to mean."
ScottishFootball,3dyil0,Nuzz88,-1,Mon Jul 20 20:22:33 2015 UTC,"No, the Sky headline clearly states a total of 6 with 2 of those suspended.  You even agree with that:   it means 6 game ban, with 2 being suspended   This is not correct English.  It is wrong.  What they meant to say is 6 game ban and 2 suspended"

ScottishFootball,3dm6q7,finmair32,2,Fri Jul 17 18:40:49 2015 UTC,It's a bit different to last year tbh. We got probably the toughest unseeded team in round two and then only naarowly went out to one of the best teams from one of the best leagues in world football.  This year we were drawn with a team that would also be seeded for round three so if we win the tie we get their seeding place and have drawn one of the lowest ranked teams in the competition -- though they are in Central Asia and have improved since Stuart Duff played for them.

ScottishFootball,3diddj,Phillips455,2,Thu Jul 16 19:12:45 2015 UTC,I think Inverness have been dominating possession so far according to the radio stream. I think they can maybe turn it around.
ScottishFootball,3diddj,Digestivetoe1,2,Thu Jul 16 19:18:48 2015 UTC,Hopefully they do. Im busy watching the aberdeen stream. They seem to be having a lot of communication problems with the defence and keeper. And the home team are getting a lot of shots on target. The only thing preventing aberdeen going 1-0 or more down is sheer luck.  edit: seems they are going to be cooling breaks. So maybe thats why aberdeen havent been playing to their potential.

Their keeper saved a couple of good chances (Armstrong, Ciftci, Biton, Griffiths). A bit more of a cutting edge and we will be through no problem.   Anybody know what happened to GMS, did he go off injured in the first 2 minutes? Or did Deila put up a false team sheet?"
ScottishFootball,3dfex5,thinkaboutyourdad,3,Wed Jul 15 21:43:24 2015 UTC,GMS had a tight groin and they didn't want to risk it. Will be back next week though.

ScottishFootball,3cz2ik,hlainelarkinmk2,3,Sun Jul 12 14:11:33 2015 UTC,"I don't think a wage cap would affect the Scottish game much to be honest, given that  most clubs in Scotland follow a 50-60% wages-to-turnover ratio.

ScottishFootball,3cqcjw,cammymd,2,Sun Jul 12 10:36:35 2015 UTC,I'm sure they're based off of the past 5 years. I'd be curious to see if historical success beyond that time frame or actual European performance (which is really just the Old Firm) plays into it.  Which would be in the favour of Aberdeen I suppose.
ScottishFootball,3cqcjw,Red_Dog1880,2,Fri Jul 10 10:53:17 2015 UTC,A big reason this is going lower is because this is the first season that Rangers UEFA Cup final run does not count any towards the Scottish rank any more. That was a lot of points.  Rangers might have been shit most years in Europe but we at least got the odd run that kept our co-efficient in a better shape.
ScottishFootball,3cqcjw,the-son-and-heir,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:10:35 2015 UTC,I thought the coefficients are calculated from the last 5 seasons? Rangers UEFA cup final was in 2008 so that would have been out of the coefficient calculations for a couple seasons already no?

It makes no sense what so ever. They last played in Europe in 2013-2014 (see above) and before that 2010-2011 where they lost against Maribor 2-6 on aggregate.  Meanwhile Aberdeen made it to the third round last season.  Maybe they benefited from some of the other Scottish club results, they count too for a small fraction."
ScottishFootball,3cqcjw,skelpie,3,Sat Jul 11 02:42:10 2015 UTC,Think its calculated on results in Europe in the 5 years previous.

ScottishFootball,3cpwxf,cammymd,5,Thu Jul 9 21:33:53 2015 UTC,"Did you see the bit that Wright came out with about the Old firm damaging the coefficient in the last 5 years? Found it rather unfair considering Celtic have been in the Group stages (albeit not won all of their games and getting rather nailed by the poles last year), the last 16 in 12/13 and rangers being in the last 16 of the Uefa cup in 10/11... Weve pretty much had atleast one group stage representation for the last 6 or 7 years. He can't really complain after tonight though, much less blame the OF."
ScottishFootball,3cpwxf,MathewClark9,5,Thu Jul 9 21:44:36 2015 UTC,"He blamed us for damaging the coefficient, when we are the only teams to have contributed to the fucking coefficient in any significant way for about 30 years. He can get fucked, he's clearly a sour cunt."
ScottishFootball,3cpwxf,MrBigShot94,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:36:31 2015 UTC,"Indeed. I'm sure them going out in the first round will probably damage it further, although i guess it depends how much further aberdeen get and whether Celtic get CL group stages and if they can win a tie. If we slip further down the coeff rankings i think we lose another EL spot too, meaning 1st gets CL, 2nd gets EL 2nd round and SC winner gets EL 1st round or whatever..."
ScottishFootball,3cpwxf,MathewClark9,2,Thu Jul 9 22:41:19 2015 UTC,"Thankfully every country in Europe gets 3 Europa League places at the moment but a lower coefficient would mean that teams start earlier, which obviously isn't doing well for us at the moment."

ScottishFootball,3cpwxf,gamerme,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:00:31 2015 UTC,"If anything, I'd argue Celtic and Rangers doing so well in Europe has been a hindrance to Scottish clubs in the past. It's led to an artificially good co-efficient for the country as a whole.  The last three times United have been in Europe they've gone in at a relatively advanced stage and been drawn against AEK Athens, Slask and Dynamo Moscow. If they'd had the opportunity to feel their way into European football with a tie or two against lesser opposition, it may have been better. The AEK and Slask ties were both definitely winnable. It just took United too long to realise it.  That said, if you get papped out by an Armenian team in your first match, it has nothing to do with the co-efficient."

There isn't another player in Scotland that could do half the things he does on those clips."

ScottishFootball,3ckq5t,williamthebloody1880,4,Thu Jul 9 13:18:05 2015 UTC,The one out of all these players I wish we still had the most was Russell. Miss him badly!  Close second would be Andy Robertson though. We all saw how they combined against England for Scotland's goal recently...wouldn't have minded seeing that combination for United every week!

ScottishFootball,3ckq5t,Dat_RPG,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:08:13 2015 UTC,Conway was/is a far better player than GMS and I know I'll get slated for it but I'd rather have Danny Swanson in midfield and JR up front than Ciftci in there.  Make those changes and I'd say we'd be top at Christmas then Celtic would buy half the team and we'd end up 3rd.
ScottishFootball,3ckq5t,BillyDaviesThighs,2,Wed Jul 8 21:01:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree, as much as I enjoyed watching GMS (when he showed up!) I always thought Conway was a much better all round winger.  Have to disagree about Swanson being in the team. Although he was always capable of something spectacular he just didn't live up to his potential. Though I think for the sake of the post it was actually those who we'd sold in the last couple of years under McNamara."
ScottishFootball,3ckq5t,fridgelad,2,Thu Jul 9 07:32:52 2015 UTC,"I always thought Conway was a much better all round winger.   No to mention he was far more consistent than GMS. But christ, when GMS turned it on (usually against us, to be fair) he didnae half rip the piss something rotten."
ScottishFootball,3ckq5t,Vulgar_Slaughter,-2,Thu Jul 9 10:26:10 2015 UTC,"I'd have Souttar ahead of Fojut. I thought he was garbage.  Nevertheless, the defence isn't strong enough. Still though, what a team. They'd be fantastic to watch."
ScottishFootball,3ckq5t,Ciftci,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:13:20 2015 UTC,Souttar was way off the mark when he was playing centre half last season. It would be impossible to ignore the astronomical inprovement when he moved forward to a holding midfield role so I still wouldn't have him in this team...yet.  Although Fojut was pretty suspect towards the last 3rd of the season he was for the most part a very solid and powerful defender - you knew he was getting a clearance header when he went up for it. Plus a decent goal threat from set pieces!
ScottishFootball,3ckq5t,fridgelad,-1,Thu Jul 9 07:27:01 2015 UTC,"United's best period in the last two seasons not only coincided with Souttar at centre half, they owed a great deal to it. His ability to pass out from the back and run confidently with the ball from the back were integral to that memorable period.   I agree with you however that he looks far better in midfield. I just think he has to be in the team somewhere - as do Armstrong and Allan.  Fojut on the other hand, whilst good when attacking the ball with his head, was soft in the tackle, easily outmuscled, and with dreadful positional awareness. Powerful and solid are two words I would never use to describe him. He looked both but he was neither.  The fact he won most of his headers - and therefore chipped in with a few goals - covered up a whole host of shortfalls in his game.   If you were to look at a reel of all the goals United conceded last season, you'd soon notice just how many Fojut was to blame for."
ScottishFootball,3ckq5t,Ciftci,2,Thu Jul 9 21:09:53 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry but that's just downright false.  We were top of the league around early November last year I'm sure after a 3-0 win against St. Mirren at Tannadice. Souttar was out injured from pre-season until late November. He never featured at all in our best patch of form last season. And even when he returned he wasn't overly influential. For a point of reference, our best performances at Tannadice last season - 2-1 against Celtic in December and 6-2 against Dundee on New Years Day, Souttar featured in neither. And then of course we went on our awful patch.  Fair enough he featured heavily in the previous season (2013/2014) when we went on our run of scoring at least 4 goals in however many successive matches. But, you could argue that while we were impressive that season we were much more effective in the season just past as we actually challenged Aberdeen and Celtic until our great downfall.  But yeah, we can agree he is obviously vastly more comfortable in midfield.  Got to say, I think it's mad to say that Fojut was a terrible defender for us (although, keep in mind I did earlier concede that he had a bad end to the season but that can easily be contributed to the overall team morale and of course his own personal problems). I have looked at every single one of the goals we conceded many, many times seing them first hand and being an Arabzone subscriber and you could easily trace most of our shortcomings in defence last year to Watson and Dillon. In my opinion it was no secret that until McGowan came along teams targeted our right back as our weak link, although saying that Dixon hasn't been outstanding since returning but hopefully he can rectify that after a good pre-season."
ScottishFootball,3ckq5t,fridgelad,0,Thu Jul 9 22:20:36 2015 UTC,"I think you must have misread what I wrote. United's best spell in the last two seasons. As a United supporter you know exactly what period I'm referring to. So I'll disregard the first part of your reply.  Yes, I was obviously referring to the period when we were on the run of scoring 4 a game. It matters not whether we were more effective last season, I was talking about the spell over the last two seasons that United played their best football. There are no two ways about it - it was when Souttar was at centre half. My contention is that a massive part of that good play came down to Souttar's ability to pass and play it out from the back. If you want to dispute my point, dispute that. Don't go rambling off about what he did or didn't do last season, or how effective the team was when he wasn't in it. Because that has nothing to do with the point I was making.  We'll have to agree to disagree on Fojut. I'm absolutely certain that, despite appearances, he was by no means solid or powerful. Glad to be rid of him."
ScottishFootball,3ckq5t,Ciftci,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:24:18 2015 UTC,As a United supporter as well I'd have to 100% disagree with you on Fojut too. Also I'd argue we were better when we were fighting for 1st place than when we were scoring 4 a game.
ScottishFootball,3ckq5t,X210690,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:20:07 2015 UTC,"That's your opinion.   Out of interest, what are your standout memories of United during that period?"
ScottishFootball,3ckq5t,Ciftci,2,Fri Jul 10 09:46:19 2015 UTC,"Beating Celtic 2-1, Dundee 6-2 and beating Aberdeen in the cup."
ScottishFootball,3ckq5t,X210690,0,Fri Jul 10 10:34:08 2015 UTC,"We were fortunate to win two of those games.  The derby was a real highlight for sure.  Main standouts from November/December in 2013/14 were    Gauld setting up all four goals against Thistle. I'll never forget the buzz leaving Tannadice that day,  The dismantling of Motherwell at Fir Park. Their fans shaking our hands after the game saying it was the best performance they'd ever seen. A sentiment echoed by Stuart McCall,  Going 2-1 down to Killie at home in the cup with half an hour to go and just knowing we'd outscore them. It ended up 5-2. Having to leave the pub earlier and earlier as crowds increased week on week. We eventually filled three stands for a home game against Ross County.   Outside of winning trophies, it was far and away my most enjoyable period watching United since the 80s."
ScottishFootball,3ckq5t,Ciftci,0,Fri Jul 10 12:53:32 2015 UTC,Agreed. But in a thread about league positioning this guy would rather argue about a centre half's contribution in a period where our attacking flair helped us score a lot of goals a couple years back.
ScottishFootball,3ckq5t,fridgelad,0,Fri Jul 10 07:40:54 2015 UTC,"Actually, it's a thread about how well a make-believe team would do in the league.  I'm putting forward a point that one player could make that team better, using real examples."
ScottishFootball,3ckq5t,Ciftci,0,Fri Jul 10 09:37:01 2015 UTC,"I must have misread what you said but when referring to a teams ""best period"" you'd assume that was the point when we were top of the league! Fair enough, not our most entertaining period but that's not what you initially said.  Either way, hardly ""rambling"" when my reply is a list of points that literally respond to your previous comment.  Agree to disagree."

I'll expect them to begin to address this is the next year.

ScottishFootball,3cho5h,the-son-and-heir,3,Wed Jul 8 11:12:45 2015 UTC,"Be interesting to see their next financial report, find out just how much of the wage bill they managed to trim. Memory serves me right, if costs stay the same as last season they need be making about £16m in the first half of the season just to break even. They made £13m in that time frame last season."
ScottishFootball,3cho5h,CptES,0,Wed Jul 8 18:01:41 2015 UTC,Will those accounts be audited?  Will those 'contingent liabilities' remain?  £12m max from ticket sales. Do they have any other revenue streams for football costs?
ScottishFootball,3cho5h,the-son-and-heir,2,Wed Jul 8 18:06:27 2015 UTC,"Will those accounts be audited?   Unknown. Apparently Deloitte who did the job before resigned and the board never told anyone until after they left.   Will those 'contingent liabilities' remain?   Ask Mr Sports Direct.   £12m max from ticket sales. Do they have any other revenue streams for football costs?   Not much, that I know of. TV money is practically nil and the merch money (which would almost certainly let them break even, since it was about £3m last season) is all going to Ashley. Gate money for the season is probably not going to be close to £12m, it was half that (£5.7m) last season."
ScottishFootball,3cho5h,CptES,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:15:30 2015 UTC,Think its Craig whyte who will need to resolve those liabilities.  So a loss making company with no finance arrangements with any bank. I doubt they'll last the season unless something significant changes.  Edit - words and stuff
ScottishFootball,3cho5h,the-son-and-heir,3,Wed Jul 8 20:01:52 2015 UTC,"Depends on who they can get to loan the club money again. Some food for thought though, since liquidation Rangers have never run a profit. Hell, I don't think they ran a profit for about five years before that either."

ScottishFootball,3cg32g,jaaykidd,19,Tue Jul 7 17:13:52 2015 UTC,"What people are missing is that this is now Manchester City (Denayer) and Real Madrid that see Celtic as a team which is capable of developing young talent. Two of the richest clubs on the planet.  As a result, other young players will begin to think not 'Scotland, pish place to play' rather 'Scotland, place where some of the most highly rated young players in England/Spain/Europe can develop.'   Nothing but delighted about this."
ScottishFootball,3cg32g,imnotbenhoy,5,Tue Jul 7 19:16:20 2015 UTC,"I feel like that's a fine way to view it if we gain something from the loan.  With the example of Denayer he came in as our second center back.  Win win for both parties. This Madrid lad comes to one of our most contested position that we also have the most quality in.    Letting him play ahead of anyone is detrimental to the cause.  If he was the same supposed caliber, but say a left back or striker I'd be ecstatic."
ScottishFootball,3cg32g,CelticxBhoy,8,Tue Jul 7 19:54:58 2015 UTC,"Is it detrimental to the cause if he comes, is fantastic, maybe stays an extra season, eventually breaks into a world class team and other players think 'oh look, if you do well at Celtic you can become great, maybe I'll go there instead of Burnley?'  It's also a player the world has been talking about, and it looks like he might be playing for Celtic next season. Turning peoples attention to Celtic. Win win.   If Armstrong, mckay-steven, Johansen or whoever can't get into the team because of this guy then they'll have to train and play better. Simple."
ScottishFootball,3cg32g,imnotbenhoy,2,Tue Jul 7 20:51:34 2015 UTC,"Sadly I don't think we lose players to the likes of Burnley because they can't become greats a Celtic, but because we just can't afford to offer them the same kind of contract.  I'd also be a lot happier about these kind of deals if we benefit financially, we all accept we are in a position we keep players and sell them on.  It feels like a definite step backwards if we don't even get that far and are only a loan club."
ScottishFootball,3cg32g,CelticxBhoy,2,Tue Jul 7 22:13:15 2015 UTC,"I hadn't really looked at it that way, but you make a very good point both here and below. I just wish he would have come last year and we could profit from the guy."

ScottishFootball,3cg32g,dylando1888,3,Wed Jul 8 19:26:40 2015 UTC,Quite torn on this one. On one hand it seems stupid to get in a player we don't have a hope of keeping and improve him for someone else. But on the other hand it does seem like a good advertisement for our team on the international stage to be seen to improve a promising youngster again after doing so well with Jason.   Part of me also wonders what Ronny's real motivation is here. I mean we basically took Jason so we could get Boyata a year later when Boyata was really who we wanted all along. So who do we really want to keep after we get Martin for a year on loan?  In a seasons time a much improved Martin leaves Celtic and in return they sell us Jack Harper for cheap. You heard it here first.
ScottishFootball,3cg32g,mykil,3,Tue Jul 7 20:14:00 2015 UTC,"Jack Harper is either at Madrid for good, or done this season. Hes too old to play for their youth team, and if he isnt good enough they won`t keep him around for Castilla."

ScottishFootball,3cg32g,MrBigShot94,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:32:38 2015 UTC,Don't really know why we would want him.  Just displaces Johansen or would take away time from Armstrong playing in his best position as I assume we wouldn't play him on the wing.
ScottishFootball,3cg32g,CelticxBhoy,4,Tue Jul 7 18:59:22 2015 UTC,Don't really know why we would want him.   Because he's good at playing football maybe? I'd have thought this would've been obvious. Just because we've already got good players in a position doesn't mean we shouldn't be looking for others. It'll push the other players to play better to hold on to their positions.
ScottishFootball,3cg32g,MarkyBhoy101,2,Tue Jul 7 20:26:58 2015 UTC,"Agreed, the kid looks like an exciting player and i will be more than happy if he signs for a season or two."

Last place gets the champions league, 12th gets the Europa and 7th gets relegated.  Makes more sense than their 8-8-8 idea."

It's like selling your Bugatti, and taking your Skoda to Knockhill instead, you won't be competitive on that track.

ScottishFootball,3byznk,williamthebloody1880,-10,Sun Jul 5 17:48:13 2015 UTC,"Hahaha whoever had 12:00 win!   My beliefs for Scottish football can be summed up in 3 points  1) Keep talent in Scotland at all costs. Why? Improve the Scottish league at all costs even if that means selling talent to rivals. Failure to do so affects every team in Scotland (i would prefer Ciftci to play for Aberdeen than Celtic, but that doesnt seem to be an option)  2) the inherent belief that selling to a rival club or within your own league is a bad thing. Its not If Celtic are Strong it improves every other team in the league, if Aberdeen are strong it improves every other team in the league so on and so forth. We also all benefit from one clubs achievement outside Scotland these benefits can be seen in Co-efficient, monetary payments made to clubs as a result of a team performing well in europe and this is the attitude we all need to have to pull Scottish football out of the shit cobered mess it is in.  3) any club that takes the attitude that their individual needs is more important than the needs of us all is disgusting. In the grand scheme what will Ciftci do? We do not know, he could achieve nothing. Its the attitude that my individual needs (utd) are more than that of everyone that somehow worsening other teams makes me stronger (it may well do for a short period, but in the long term it wont) and this attitude is a disease. We need to look at improving Scottish football as a combined effort not some narrow-minded point of view that we should aim to weaken our opponents to make us look stronger. It will only make us.look stronger domestically not make us stronger overall.  Ultimately very few people agree with me but who cares we all have different beliefs on how to make football in Scotland better; mine are entrenched in the fact we shoild be looking to improve every team not lower the standards of those at the top.  E: phone cant sort formatting."
ScottishFootball,3byznk,nuzzy1888,14,Fri Jul 3 10:57:10 2015 UTC,"I have never read a bigger load of nonsense in years.  You want a suggestion for improving Scottish football?  How about Celtic sell, or at least loan, all their top players to other Scottish clubs?  Your squad is strong enough that you'd probably still win the league and every other team is strengthened.  Start this week (we'll call dibs on Craig Gordon) and it'll help Aberdeen and St Johnstone next Thursday and improve the coefficient.  It's nonsense, isn't it?  So is everything you've said.  How does Dundee United weakening themselves to Celtic's benefit strengthen both teams?  We saw it last season when Aberdeen signed McLean from St Mirren.  It doesn't.  That you can write this:   not some narrow-minded point of view that we should aim to weaken our opponents to make us look stronger.   Even in context, while arguing for Dundee United weakening themselves to make Celtic look stronger is completely ridiculous.  Dundee United do not exist for the benefit of Celtic Football Club.  The only team that exists for the benefit of Celtic Football Club are Celtic Football Club.  Why don't you just admit that what I wrote above is the truth.  You think Celtic have the right to any player from any other Scottish team you want and you're upset that Dundee United, rather than being good little boys and behaving, have had the balls to stand up to you."
ScottishFootball,3byznk,dufcdarren,-6,Fri Jul 3 12:07:35 2015 UTC,"Your arguement is based on the fact that improving the league means improving competition but thats incorrect, if league income was based on competition alone then Bolvia or some small league would be leading the world.  Top Countries are they competitive?  England - Yes. Germany - No. Spain - No, (two horse race) Italy - No  What do all these leagues do have in common is Quality; the quality of the players within these leagues out strips everyone else.  Scotland currently consumes more domestic football per capita than any other country in europe (last time I checked anyway). So improving the market share of football in Scotland will have little benefit. What we need to improve Scottish football is to improve neutral viewership  Neutral viewership: People who watch football as entertainment but couldnt really be fussed with the end result.   How do you improve neutral viewership? Improve the quality of the league.  How do you improve the quality of the league? Retain good players in Scotland at all costs.  William, I just dont understand your hatred of me, every exchange we've had is you assuming that I mean something when I dont. I actually love football and more than that I love Scottish football. I support Celtic, but I watch every scottish game that comes my sky box. I dont think Celtic should have the right to any player but I believe we need to keep whatever talent is willing to stay here and in this case only Celtic can appear to afford him. I actually dont rate Ciftci as being Celtic Quality but that standard is forever dropping as Scottish football goes further and further dowm a rabbit hole. We should get a pint."

Make it more competitive.  How do you attract quality players?  Make the league more competitive.  That's how.  Not by having all the decent players focussed at one team.  You can disguise it all you want, but it's becoming more and more obvious that my initial assessment of you was right.  Especially as you're getting butthurt over Celtic not being able to sign a player you don't think is good enough for the team"
ScottishFootball,3byznk,dufcdarren,-5,Fri Jul 3 13:42:28 2015 UTC,"What are you basing your opinion of:  ""How do you get neutral viewers watching Scottish football? Make it more competitive. How do you attract quality players? Make the league more competitive.""  Competition does not equal money into the league, at least thats not what I see by looking at the top leagues around the world. Explain it to me. Its an opinion you hold so you should be able to back that up with some proof or reasoning right?  Money into the league is generated by the Quality of the output in this case football. Quality players play in leagues for money. Improve the money within the league so we can attain better players, by improving the quality. Improve the quality by keeping good players in Scotland."
ScottishFootball,3byznk,nuzzy1888,4,Fri Jul 3 13:53:56 2015 UTC,"You can't see the woods for the trees here in his argument.  Basically, only 1 team currently might interest ""quality"" players, disregarding the odd one here and there.  You can only play 11+3 subs every game, a few of those slots are called for by regulars, so what have possible signings got? A chance of being one of 2 midfield positions that aren't filled? Them and a few others battling for it and rotting on the bench.  Look at the players who you signed from rivals and rotted them on the bench for a few years. That isn't good for Scottish football.  These ""talented"" players should maybe be playing. Willo Flood (not a quality player IMO, but was good at the time) played like 6 games, probably against us IIRC, then fucked off somewhere else (Middlesboro?).  How is that good for Scotland? Zaluska spent about a gazillion matches benched. He'd still have got a game in almost any team in Scotland for the whole of it.  The Celtic way is to weaken any competition, then complain the competition is weak, making Scottish football seem weak."

However we are not talking about whats the best possible solution to a problem we are asking whats the best possible solution avaliable.  Best possible solution out there would be for Ciftci to stay at Dundee Utd, or within our league outside of Celtic thats obvious for everyone to see.  What are our current options:  Sell him to England and improve their league/quality of their output (football) Sell him to Celtic and improve Celtic (debateable but you get the point.)  I advocating that keeping as much talent in Scotland is possible instead of giving it them to a direct competitor (in terms of England competing for tv money/neutral viewership) to improve their league or the quality of their product."

That the quality of the football is the main factor for making them watch.  So by selling off our best players outwith Scotland and giving it to a direct competitor we are lowering our own stock in the world of football and increasing theirs.  Its that thinking that has brought us to where we are; we need to change it up. We need to fix things now before its too late.

I'd much rather get repeat viewers.  They'll tune in regularly.  They'll start supporting teams.  They'll go to games and buy merchandise.  They'll, directly and indirectly, keep bringing money to the league.  How do we get them?  Competition.  Put it this way.  The BBC could announce tomorrow a new TV series with all the biggest actors in the world.   And they'll get viewers.  But if there's nothing to hook those viewers ratings will plummet.    In drama, it's called conflict.  In football, it's competition that'll keep people watching"
ScottishFootball,3byznk,AbdulPullMaTool,-2,Fri Jul 3 14:34:56 2015 UTC,"Why then do leagues such as Germany, Italy, France & Spain who are relatively non competitive leagues keep such large levels of regular viewership outside their own country?  When I am choosing between 2 games on TV that I have no real investment in what one will I pick? The one thats more competitive or the one thats of a higher quality? Quality every time. I would rather watch Barca thrash someone 7-0 than watch a competitive 1-1.  I would argue that a higher quality product will attain more viewers overall and from there people who watch a game and had a good experience or high level of entertainment from watching that game will be more willing to tune in again, eventually leading to as you say continual viewing, support and game attendance."
ScottishFootball,3byznk,williamthebloody1880,3,Fri Jul 3 14:43:19 2015 UTC,"Ahhhhh, I see the issue here.  Let me clue you in.  What you would do =/= what everyone would do.  The 7-0 humping will get viewers once or twice.  Close, competitive games where the results actually matter will get regular viewers.  Which will increase the money.  Plus more competition = better quality players wanting to be here.  Just admit it, you want the quality players at Celtic and not elsewhere in the SPL.  Nothing to be ashamed of"
ScottishFootball,3byznk,Jamie54,-1,Fri Jul 3 17:32:43 2015 UTC,"So you keep saying but saying something over and over again doesnt make it true.

ScottishFootball,3byznk,X210690,3,Fri Jul 3 17:57:03 2015 UTC,So in that regard would you say that viewership has increased since rangers left the premiership? rangers of course being a direct competitor to Celtic and being the only team with the money to compete against Celtic or would you say it has decreased? Look at the Scottish Championship it was really competitive last season and most people would agree at times it was the better league to watch.

I can understand improving on Scottish talent for the sake of the Euro's but your point is stupid.  2) We would rather get to europe or with a few trophies at home. Why? Because that pulls in more cash for us than we get from Celtic getting kicked out of the group stages of the Champions League. Another stupid point.   3) Once again, i don't think you understand that the argument for improving Scottish football really lands on home grown players.   And finally, letting Ciftci go to Celtic improves the standard for Celtic and Celtic alone. It lowers the chance of a competitive league next season as it boosts one team and no others. Celtic buy players that will make their chances of winning the treble less competitive. Aberdeen, United and such buy players to make the league more competitive which brings in more viewers and more money for the league. A drop in attendance for Celtic isn't due to you guys not winning the treble, it's down to your domination of the league. People wan't competition, THAT is what benefits the league."
ScottishFootball,3byznk,fridgelad,-4,Fri Jul 3 11:44:19 2015 UTC,"1) his nationality is irrelevant he is a good player willing to play in Scotland and so should be retained in Scotland at all costs. Improving the quality of the players in our league improves how much we earn through tv rights.  2) Why cant we have both? What actually brings in more money is people outside Scotland watching Scottish Football. What attracts people to watch any domestic game that is not their own is Quality not competitiveness. Out of the top leagues in the world I would only call 1 competitive but what they all have in common? Quality. How do we improve quality of the Scottish product? Selling good players to england? No we retain them at all costs.  3) i agree that improving home grown players will improve Scottish Football but the reality is that the country the players are born in does not matter as long as they are willing to play here. Ciftci obviously is.  Your Summary: i agree that is boosts Celtic I even agree that it may make the league less competitve but I do not agree that it only benefits celtic and I do not agree that competitveness = more money.  Top Countries are they competitive?  England - Yes. Germany - No. Spain - No, (two horse race) Italy - No  What do all these leagues do have in common is Quality; the quality of the players within these leagues out strips everyone else.  Scotland currently consumes more domestic football per capita than any other country in europe (last time I checked anyway). So improving the market share of football in Scotland will have little benefit. What we need to improve Scottish football is to improve neutral viewership  Neutral viewership: People who watch football as entertainment but couldnt really be fussed with the end result.  How do you improve neutral viewership? Improve the quality of the league.  How do you improve the quality of the league? Retain good players in Scotland at all costs."

From our point of view - we take a player in who has struggled to settle anywhere else, our management team nurture him into a seemingly desired asset for bigger teams, we stand by him through all his controversy and you expect us to graciously offer him to Celtic to then play against us thereby potentially weakenening us and improving you.  Mate be realistic...that is not what any team would want."
ScottishFootball,3byznk,Timomouse,-3,Fri Jul 3 11:26:12 2015 UTC,"I agree. Its a easy pill to swallow as a Celric fan, and its much harder the further down the table you go.  That doesnt change the fact that in the long run WE need to do what we can to improve Scottish football as a whole we have been continually falling as down in quality and we will continue to fall unless we work together. Petty differences aside.  What are the alternatives? We can continue to in fight until our league is as relevant as ROI?  Utd need to do the right thing not the easy thing."

ScottishFootball,3bzco4,MrGurgeh,8,Fri Jul 3 11:08:43 2015 UTC,I'm happy on Reddit personally. I would probably stop moderating and not be an active user if it moved elsewhere.   Nobody knows the full story why Victoria was fired but I don't doubt it was unreasonable and the way the business is run seems shitty but it doesn't affect this particular subreddit in anyway so I see no reason to change.   Other mods may disagree.   EDIT: I also want to mention that I don't think that Reddit is doomed. The powers that be do need a reality check though and we as a community can do this to them by not buying Reddit Gold and choosing to use an ad blocker.  Hit them where it hurts.
ScottishFootball,3bzco4,oldcat,3,Fri Jul 3 12:18:15 2015 UTC,"Right now Reddit is at a crossroads, if all I looked at was the front page I'd probably have packed up and left already as there are now enough people setting out to try and bring down Reddit that the interesting content is becoming more and more sparse there. It's subs like this that have an actual community that I stay for and trying to move it to another site just won't work. You might be able to get a few folk to move across but a ton of folk, especially the lurkers who are the majority in most subs won't leave. If you get enough people to move you might be able to rebuild a community in another place but it will be a long building process and the community we have here would, initially at least, be lost.  We haven't seen how the senior management are going to respond to this as it has only just kicked off (I couldn't care less about the fatpeoplehate stuff because https://xkcd.com/1357/). They are in a bind, they cannot talk about why they fired Victoria, they may have good reasons, they may not, who knows. What they can do is work out what direction they want to take Reddit in, that will be the things that decides if I still want to be here and it won't be clear for weeks and more likely months. In the mean time I'm going to set a filter on RES so I don't have to see crappy Ellen Pao memes..."

I read a lot of good things about Ward and on the whole he was fine, but he had a real funny moment in the second half that should've been an easy take. Most players were lacklustre tonight but I was most disappointed in Hayes; he really looked out of sorts and his performance was nowhere near what I expect from him.   Pawlett and/or McLean must start next week if we hope to win this tie. I'd like to see Shinnie at left back as well to help out Hayes on the left hand side."

Langfield has looked dodgy for some while and Scott Brown isn't consistent enough.   So if Danny Ward is the only keeper to come in then he could see a lot of game time in all competitions.
ScottishFootball,3bvr46,Digestivetoe1,2,Thu Jul 2 15:49:07 2015 UTC,He's starting straight away for us in our Europa League game. Would have thought they would have waited until Brown made a mistake to throw Ward in but fair enough.  Our two other keepers have made a series of high profile mistakes in big matches over the years and is a blatant weak point in the squad. Hopefully Ward is the solution for now. We have loaned out our promising goalie for the year to Falkirk while Ward is at Pittodrie.

Edit: just to add a little more info - Amoo has stated in his interview that he plays on the wing (left or right).  That to me sounds like an exact replacement for Higgy, to be honest. Higgy was incredible for the second half of his first season for us, and mediocre at best for the other parts with anonymity thrown in every so often.   Also checked Carlisle forums, and this matches up with what Carlisle fans are saying: they've been mince for 2 years. Amoo played on the wing for them mainly, so I'd be surprised if we plan to play him as the sole striker."

For his sake I hope a change of scenery does him good. A lot of it in my view was mental, he'd shy away whenever someone pressured him, shite it at 50/50's and failed to take anyone on most games.  Hopefully I'm wrong and Ross County won't know him as ""FUCK SAKE FOSTER"" as well."

ScottishFootball,3bj3br,DanMill,5,Mon Jun 29 17:16:59 2015 UTC,"I like it in general.  I'm not sure what the point of splitting the 3rd division into two separate leagues, then having a mid season split but Doncaster has a fetish for splits that's almost sexual so it might satisfy that.  I'd like to see the play offs for the SPL stay, just with a system that actually makes sense  If you're having that long a winter break, I don't understand why not just move the whole thing to the summer.  I really like the idea of moving the League Cup final back to the first half of the season.  In all honesty, I'm not too sure why it was moved to begin with.  But I really, really don't agree with with no replays in the Scottish Cup.  The fact is that if a smaller team gets drawn against the likes of the Old Firm, Aberdeen, Dundee United, etc with the 50-50 gate split, taking the tie to a replay can set them financially for a good few years."

ScottishFootball,3bj3br,TurkeyHam44,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:19:53 2015 UTC,"Fewer home games means that season ticket prices should drop. The extra season tickets that are sold should, in theory, recover some of the revenue lost from losing those 2 home games each season. It will create a better atmosphere which should then encourage more punters through the gates.  I absolutely love the idea of every 'big' team starting in the first round of the Scottish Cup. It works well in Germany, and it has the potential for some glorious cupsets. Should also lead to a big payday if, say, Spartans get Celtic/Rangers and it's on tv. I think there should still be replays however.   The winter break is necessary, in my opinion. It does remove the traditional boxing day/new years day fixtures, but if the league is to grow, it needs to evolve and unfortunately I think these fixtures will just have to be collateral.   The league cup is a bit too much for my head to get round at this time of the morning, but it's an interesting format which should generate some excitement amongst the supporters and hopefully the broadcasters."

ScottishFootball,3ayvfr,Connelly90,0,Fri Jun 26 19:22:44 2015 UTC,I don't really know what way to call this one. I've seen Celtic denying interest and I'm not sure what Hibernian's logic would be to sell him to a competitor. Although they've purchased a Hearts player this year so it's been a funny one already.   They might but this is one of those ones I'll remain utterly cynical about until it happens.
ScottishFootball,3ayvfr,istillfeelyou,0,Thu Jun 25 00:09:56 2015 UTC,I don't want to spend more than 500 000.  Better players for cheaper in the English lower leagues

ScottishFootball,3aygig,ZergsRUs,2,Wed Jun 24 21:01:33 2015 UTC,"His main strength is his speed, he's been used all over the midfield but he's most effective on the wing (have seen him play on both sides) where he can turn and out-pace almost anyone. Main drawback is his size, he's can get bullied off the ball quite easily although this has been less of a problem this year.   You've got yourselves a decent player, he's good enough to start regularly and Yogi didn't use him all that much so it's no surprise to see him go either."

If there's a pass-back to be made he'll do that instead.   He's fucking deadly when he does occasionally ping one in however.

ScottishFootball,3aqiz3,Tuttle_not_Buttle,9,Mon Jun 22 18:15:13 2015 UTC,A good signing. Glad to see we've got a manager that knows what he's doing at least in terms of sourcing a team.

ScottishFootball,3aqiz3,My_Other_Name_Rocks,-4,Tue Jun 23 09:22:46 2015 UTC,"It could be the best or the worst career move of his life, depending on whether King, Warburton & (sev)co manage to pull it off . I know he probably wants to get things settled early, but personally I'd have waited until the squad was taking shape before putting my name anywhere near the dotted line.   So far they've got Wilson on a free, have taken perpetual loanee Rob Kiernan off Watford's hands and look to be lining a few old duffers on frees from across the Championship. A cynical man would say that it looks like they're shopping in the bargain basement bin, but time will tell I suppose. There's no way this squad, even if it turns out to be half decent, will be playing scintillating football until Christmas at the earliest."
ScottishFootball,3aqiz3,EliCaaash,3,Tue Jun 23 12:47:06 2015 UTC,"I don't think Rangers can afford ""scintillating football"" at this point. What they need is pure function and grit to qualify this season otherwise the fans will riot."
ScottishFootball,3aqiz3,CptES,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:53:18 2015 UTC,"That isn't really Warburton's style from what I can tell. Much of what I've been hearing coming out of the other side of town has been about building a young, dynamic team with an experienced backbone, that plays exciting, attacking football. Warburton had an average age of 23 at Brentford I think, and they won games by scoring more goals than the opposition, who tended to score a lot too. That style will probably suit him in the Scottish Championship where I think it's fair to say the opposition isn't up to the level of the English Championship. Warburton inherited a decent side though, and had been sporting director before being manager, so the stakes are a little different starting almost with a blank slate at Ibrox..  Rangers fans need something to get excited about first and foremost. Right now they want signings, but if they get some good performances and results starting in August, money spent (or not spent) won't matter so much in the longer run."

ScottishFootball,3adxq7,sleeves1991,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:21:03 2015 UTC,We've been buying some dud strikers in recent years. Griffiths is the only one I've been happy about.
ScottishFootball,3adxq7,RyaaanC,2,Fri Jun 19 10:51:57 2015 UTC,I think Scepovic has something to offer us next season.
ScottishFootball,3adxq7,the-son-and-heir,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:21:52 2015 UTC,Reckon he might of fitted better into the 4 3 3 formation but he just wasn't fast enough. Technically a good player though.
ScottishFootball,3adxq7,EliCaaash,1 point,Fri Jun 19 12:33:54 2015 UTC,He's not done much to prove it though.
ScottishFootball,3aca2b,williamthebloody1880,3,Thu Jun 18 22:56:00 2015 UTC,"There's got to be something that exists within these people that compels them to munch on other players when they're angry.  Never once, even in my deepest darkest rage, have I ever had the urge to bite the person I was angry with."
ScottishFootball,3aca2b,Connelly90,2,Fri Jun 19 00:17:58 2015 UTC,"I think we should all go to The Winchester, have a nice cold pint and wait for all this to blow over..."
ScottishFootball,3aca2b,Connelly90,3,Fri Jun 19 00:26:03 2015 UTC,So I can stop throwing my record collection at Rangers fans? lol

ScottishFootball,3aa449,gamerme,8,Thu Jun 18 12:56:38 2015 UTC,Couldn't this have happened seven games ago?
ScottishFootball,3aa449,risco89,5,Thu Jun 18 19:22:37 2015 UTC,"He got off lightly.  I think the SFA should start dishing out punishments like this the same way the Elite League (Ice Hockey) do it.  Each infringement (each punch, each shove, each outburst) is given it's own suspension, and these stack. Ending up in serious incidents carrying serious suspensions; like this one, for 18 games.   Granted, the EHL has a 50+ game season, but if we did something like this with football violent outbursts would stop right quick."
ScottishFootball,3aa449,Connelly90,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:12:22 2015 UTC,Why the huge suspension?  That's normal for ice hockey...
ScottishFootball,3aa449,williamthebloody1880,1 point,Fri Jun 19 12:40:54 2015 UTC,"Cause he checked the other guy on the head, speared him with his stick and went to do it again, threw his helmet at him and fought, instigating the fight.  Each infringement gets its own suspention and they all stack."
ScottishFootball,3aa449,Connelly90,2,Fri Jun 19 22:30:56 2015 UTC,"I'm aware that ice hockey does actually have rules, being a huge fan (go Flames go!).   I was being sarcastic, along the lines of saying I went to a fight and a hockey game broke out"
ScottishFootball,3aa449,williamthebloody1880,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:37:22 2015 UTC,Aw sorry :)  Go Leafs Go
ScottishFootball,3aa449,Connelly90,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:41:43 2015 UTC,"Dumbarton, the Leafs, you really like supporting bad teams, don't you?  :¬p"
ScottishFootball,3aa449,williamthebloody1880,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:26:09 2015 UTC,I support the teams that are closest to me. I live in Dumbarton and I've got family in Toronto.  Our time will come ;)
ScottishFootball,3aa449,Connelly90,2,Sat Jun 20 02:46:59 2015 UTC,The sun will burn out and envelop the earth and the Leafs still won't have won another cup.
ScottishFootball,3aa449,CptES,1 point,Sat Jun 20 14:24:17 2015 UTC,"Next year is ""our year"".  Just like every year lol"
ScottishFootball,3aa449,Connelly90,3,Sat Jun 20 14:27:44 2015 UTC,I probably say he got off likely
ScottishFootball,3aa449,scmck,2,Thu Jun 18 12:56:55 2015 UTC,Is the ban transferable to an another FA? Surely no one in Scotland is going to sign him.
ScottishFootball,3aa449,istillfeelyou,2,Thu Jun 18 14:40:07 2015 UTC,It won't happen but I'd love to see Leeds sign him just for the look on his and Erwin's face.
ScottishFootball,3aa449,mullanaphy,2,Thu Jun 18 16:20:50 2015 UTC,Ranger fans rejoice.
ScottishFootball,3aa449,Belvedre,2,Thu Jun 18 16:29:40 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, but I still think that cunt Lee Erwin deserved a 3 game or so ban. He started it, and it was a violent shove.  Should have at least been sent off."
ScottishFootball,3aa449,Connelly90,6,Thu Jun 18 20:05:03 2015 UTC,"Should have been sent off.  But the whole incident began when Erwin approached Moshni for a handshake and was told to ""fuck off""; just shake the guy's fucking hand and don't be a wean."
ScottishFootball,3aa449,Belvedre,-2,Fri Jun 19 00:04:46 2015 UTC,So he says. We dont know 100 percent. Even if he did players say fuck off all time. That push was violent conduct
ScottishFootball,3aa449,Connelly90,3,Fri Jun 19 00:45:48 2015 UTC,"Just saying the whole thing could have been avoided if Moshni shook the guy's hand like a grown ass man, instead of acting all pissy and not winning a game of football.  Shove was violent conduct, and it should have been treated as such, but Lennox Lewis here was much further down the well of arseholery that day."
ScottishFootball,3aa449,JarlofScotland,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:50:49 2015 UTC,"A three match ban for a push? Good grief, man."
ScottishFootball,3aa449,Red_Dog1880,1 point,Fri Jun 19 03:17:23 2015 UTC,"When the other Motherwell players jumped in (some thinking that they were in The Football Factory) Erwin came back to land a punch too.  Plus he started it all, even if you think it's only a push."
ScottishFootball,3aa449,JarlofScotland,1 point,Sun Jun 21 12:02:13 2015 UTC,"Most players have some restraint, unlike Mohsni. Someone pushing you does not give you the right to physically assault anyone. I'm astonished that you're trying to blame Mohsni's disgraceful attack on Erwin."
ScottishFootball,3aa449,Red_Dog1880,0,Sun Jun 21 20:24:05 2015 UTC,"It's you who apparently completely ignores the fact that not only did Erwin start it all but he later also came in again to have another go. So it's perfectly normal for Rangers fans to question why he's not getting punished properly.   That has nothing to do with absolving Moshni of any blame, he overreacted in a huge way and deservedly gets punished."
ScottishFootball,3aa449,JarlofScotland,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:27:31 2015 UTC,But Belvedre argued that Erwin should've had a three match ban for a shove. A shove! That is what I'm arguing against.
ScottishFootball,3aa449,Red_Dog1880,0,Sun Jun 21 21:00:11 2015 UTC,"Even if it was only a push, it's still (probably) classed as violent conduct under the rules of the SFA which carries a 3 match ban.  http://www.scottishfa.co.uk/resources/documents/SAFAFiles/ClubDownloads/Discipline/Disciplinary%20Procedures.pdf   Violent Conduct - Adopting a threatening or aggressive attitude: 3 games   edit: I just saw that actually pushing an opponent also carries a 3 match ban."
ScottishFootball,3aa449,Belvedre,-2,Sun Jun 21 21:05:01 2015 UTC,"I mean it wasn't just a push was it? The game is over Moshni is walking away, and Erwin comes over and violently shoves him from the back.  To me thats clear violent conduct"
ScottishFootball,3aa449,JarlofScotland,-2,Fri Jun 19 03:21:41 2015 UTC,"Yes, it was just a push. Get over your bitterness and stop playing the victim card."
ScottishFootball,3aa449,Belvedre,0,Fri Jun 19 17:43:31 2015 UTC,"Christ. I'm happy Mohsni got banned he deserved it, but to say that Erwin did nothing wrong is ridiculous. If Erwin doesn't confront Mohsni then nothing happens."
